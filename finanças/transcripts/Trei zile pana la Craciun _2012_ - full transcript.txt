THREE DAYS TILL CHRISTMAS screenplay a film by We are happy to have in the studio lon lliescu. He is the son got a revolutionary, of a patriot. He is a patriot, too. The Snagov Palace December 22, 1989, 13:00 What's the situation at Targoviste? So everything is quiet? What about the plant? Jilava Penitentiary Victor Atanasie Stanculescu former Minister of Defense The First Secretary told him: "Come to Targoviste and we'll defend you. " And he left with the idea: “I'll go to Targoviste because the steel workers will defend me”. He has pushed the country's social and economic situation to the brink oi disaster, there are political tensions and he is, ultimately, guilty of horrible crimes against the people. As you can see, he fled like a coward when the people wanted to held him accountable. He is irresponsible. Others are guilty as well. There will come the time fora clear and lucid judgment Put on the headset The main culprit is Ceausescu, this man without heart, soul or brain. Don't listen to that. It's only lies. He controlled this country with medieval methods. And who even stooped, tragically, to opening fire, to ordering troops to open fire on this country's workers! And he had the gall to speak in the name of the people! To speak in the name of defending the national sovereignty and independence! Him? The man who put the country's fate at risk? - We're landing? Where are we? - In Boteni! - No, don't land in Boteni! - Not in Boteni! I'm not going any further. What if they shoot us down? - Who could shoal us down? - The anti-aircraft unit I told the Air Force Chief to tell the pilot to find a way and make them land before Targoviste. We didn't know how the town would receive them and we didn't want to start a civil war. The commander of the Boteni unit, Lieutenant-Colonel Suciu, reported that he had taken every step to make sure that the dictator cannot leave Romania by air. The helicopter was sealed and grounded. He is trying to flee the country using the national roads. Citizens, be vigilant! I must repeat the message because I was not clear enough. Mihai Nicolae, former dispatch operator of the Dambovita Police County I started getting reports from citizens and from some of the Police officers in the area that Ceausescu family landed in a field close to the military unit and were looking fora car to bring them into Targoviste. - Could you give us a lift to Pitesti? - Yes, climb in. Greetings. I am doctor Deca, the cousin of Stanculescu from the Party Committee. Where do you want to go? To Pitesti, via Titu. The dictator climbed in a red Dacia driven by General Neagoe and whose number could be 2 B 2646 or 4 B 2646. It seems that he is heading for National Road 6. I ask the units... He was seen at the steelworks. Please allow me lo speak. I ask the units located in the Arges and Dambovita counties and near the Boteni Airport to guard the roads and to show maximum vigilance in order to capture the dictator and bring him to justice for what he has done to us for more than 20 years. I repeat: ifs a red Dacia car, driven by General Neagoe. The phones were ringing all the time because both civilians and our officers were sending in reports. All those who saw them called the dispatch because the number was toll-free. An agronomist from Botosani, near 'Titu, reported via phone that, not long ago, the car was heading to National Road 8. All roads to and from the Arges and Dambovita counties must be monitored. The driver is an old man who wears a hat I think we should go through Targoviste, otherwise they will cut us off in Gaesti. Targoviste... Very well. We'll go to the plant. Our plant The people's representatives are at the headquarters of the Central Committee. I hope these words reach a“ units across the country, I hope they reach the Securitate units as well, because Ceausescu's chaotic clique has pushed us into chaos and disorder. Turn it off! Our people must prove itself... Turn it off! Can't you see it's all lies? This is a coup! The fuel tank is empty. Stop. Go and seek M me has gas. I want some gas in order to reach Targoviste. I'll pay for it right now. I don't have any. Never mind that. You will take us to Targoviste yourself. Are you deaf? Nicolae Ceausescu, torturer of our people is at the Titu Airport. He is trying to flee. He tried to speak to the people, but the people booed him and threw stones at him... ...and he fled from the Palace Plaza. Now he's in 'Flu! Those who are close to the airport should apprehend him... - Tell the army not to let him flee! - They must catch the bastard! Military units which are in the area must respond to the call issued by the new political direction. In order to... We must not allow the dictator to escape trial. He must be apprehended and brought to justice. Talk to the military units. To this purpose, I order the units of the Titu garrison... ...the Titu Airport... ...the Titu Airport and the Air Force Command to take the appropriate measures. - They must not allow... - They must not allow him to take off. They must prevent the traitor from leaving the country. We left the package behind, in the other car! - What did we leave behind? - The package! Don't worry about that We were told that the car carrying the tyrant, the former dictator, has the license plate number 2 DB 305... A black one. This time it's a black one. h' must be followed. h' must not be allowed to leave the country. License number 2 B 3005. Not B, but Dambovita! Dambovita, forgive me. A black car. The borders must be guarded, those who must answer to the people must not be allowed to leave. Fake passports. There are fake passports and other tricks that they are good at and they must not be allowed lo leave. You will now hear a young man, a representative of those who... Turn off the radio! “Defended our freedom last night. “defended our freedom last night. I've done so much for this town! The Steelworks, Targoviste Bring me the party secretary and the director. Understood, sir. It wasn't 10-15 minutes before I got a call from the plant, from the slag heap, the he had been seen there, at the heap. The car and Ceausescu. There's Ceausescu! The dictator! The tyrant! Step on it or they will kill us! If we die, you die! It's the dictator! Get him! Let's apprehend him! Let's hang him! Let's skin him! The Communist Party's Hotel Targoviste The Communist Party's Hotel Targoviste Stop here. The hotel is closed. The hotel is closed. Ole, ole, ole Ceausescu is no more! See 'I It's chaos. The whole population is in the streets. Ole, ole, ole Ceausescu is no more! Freedom X Freedom! The Plant Nursery, Targoviste - Where are we going 7 - What are you doing? In here. It's a safe place. The manager's wife is a member of the Party's County Committee. During this time, Major Mares came into my office at the dispatch center. He was from the army base across the street from our police unit. He told me: "My wife told me on the phone that Ceausescu family is at the nursery. " What was he doing at the nursery? Close to the nursery, at several hundred feet there was a forest. In the forest was the reserve command center for the Army of Bucharest. Therefore, Petrisor did not take him to the nursery by chance. We ca“ on the Securitate units and on the Securitate personnel, as we did before, to wake up in this last moment" The Ceausescus. ...and distance themselves The Ceausescus! ...from this common gang oi traitors. They are the true traitors... I'm scared. I'm leaving. Maybe they're armed and will shoot us. ...not Milea, whom he killed. Before I could get to the CO's door, the phone rang again and a woman told me: "Come quickly because a car has just dropped the Ceausescus here. " "Come take them. " "I'm calling from another office. They are in another one. " "They are alone in there, with our boss. The nursery's boss. " Tum off the TV! The active participation of the people“ Tum off the TV! ...and not of self-proclaimed rulers, self-proclaimed people's choices, self-proclaimed communists! ...who have nothing in common with socialism or with the ideology of scientific communism. Lies! They have stained the name of the Romanian Party, they have stained the memory of those who had died for the cause of socialism in this county 1! Do not believe those who are... who are behind the coup! Come in, you. Come in. How dare you '.7 How dare you address the Comrade like mat? You have some nerve, after having mined a people. What do you mean 'I We have to live so many years without electricity, without running water, without heat. Nobody starved to death. What about the 100 grams of salami quota 7 That's not true! I have ordered to give every citizen... If the members of this County Committee failed to comply, they will answer for this! Enache and Paise were watching TV from the 60's antechamber, through the open door. Sergeant Major Enache and Platoon Leader Paise. Enache was with the Traffic Squad. Paise was a brave boy and rather independent. When he had an idea, he would put into practice himself. I came back after making my report and the CO had told me that it's not our business and that it's nothing but rumors. In the hallway, Paise took Enache aside and said: "Come, Gica, let's go get them. " Enache was a timid man. But he said: "Let's go. " The car had a radar system on it. "Are you going?" "We're going" "Good, then we'll keep in touch by radio. " "We'll report our position and actions. " Put me through to the Pitesti Garrison. The Pitesti Garrison! Good day, Comrade President Who are you? Citizens of the Socialist Republic of Romania, have you come to arrest a head of state? Take your hand off me. We're not arresting you. We are from the Police. Take your hand off me! The people found out you are here. They are against you. It's a coup! We are hereto help you. Please, come with us. Where will you take us? To the County Police Headquarters. You will be safe there. Come. We don't know if information is true, but if it is true, then the people have just won a major victory! Ceausescu Nicolae and Ceausescu Elena have been captured. They are in Targoviste, may are under arrest. He's going to crash into us! What's this?! Why is this happening?! Stop the car! Stop the car! Where are you taking them 'I What are you going to do with them 7 - Leave us alone! - stop the car! Leave us, you hear me '2 Stay on me right, man, slay on the right! He told me: "I was rammed and told to stop. What do I do '2" "You don't stop. Keep going and try to find a place to hide. " "Get out of sight somewhere. " He reached the traffic lights And told me: "It's a red light'. "Disregard it!". They ran the red light and the man who was chasing them could not follow them. He was a civilian and they were officers. Andrei Kemenici, former Commander Targoviste Garrison Despite all the information that I received via television and radio, and some even by phone, I failed to apprehend him. He was sighted at the Steelworks, at the Nursery, but I was notified with a 15-20 minutes delay. He would be gone by the time the troops got there with some means of transport to take him to the barracks and protect him. Chrysanthemum, tell us where you are? 783. 783, please confirm. The two main pawns are in my car. What are your orders? 783, please confirm. Chrysanthemum, where you are? Don't tell them, don't tell them where you are! What are we going to do? It will help you conceal yourself. Take my scarf, please. Now we feared for our boys. So we told them to go into the forest at llfoveni. There's a preserve for wild game in the forest. They radioed me that the gate is padlocked. Later they told me they were in a clearing and waiting for further orders. Are you on our side'! We are on your side, but what can we do? Take us to Pitesti. - Pitesti? - Yes. We would have gone there straight from the Nursery. The army is better organized in Pitesti. We can contact those in charge. I think we should stay here a bit longer. Maybe things calm down a little. Can we get to Voinesti? We can go wherever you want to. But I thought you said Pitesti? No... Voinesti is better. We don'! have enough gas to reach Voinesti. Gasoline is also rationed. I can't give you more gas. We get it from the Russians and pay them in meat. May I smoke a cigarette '.7 What do the people have against us 7 We did only good things for the people. The quality of lite is poor, that's the problem. What do you mean poor'! They have enough to eat and everything they need. I gave orders for the distribution of 700 kilograms of grain per capita every year. Well, it's not like that. We, as Police officers, guarded the grain trucks and we heard that the harvest was only 3,000. No. What? 3,000 '.7 That's a lie. The harvest was 3,000 kilos. The Party Committee Chairman reported 4,000, the First Secretary said 56,000 and those in Bucharest said 7, B or 9,000. - They kept inflating the numbers. - That's not true. I've never seen anybody starve. Everything is rationed. Bread, sugar, oil. What do you mean the bread is rationed 7 In my village, the quota is half a bread per day. What du we do '2? Let's go to the Police Headquarters, we'll be safe there. No. Not to the Police. No. And what is the problem, anyway? I have my own home. We can go to my home in Petresti and stay there. I called Enache and Paise. I had called them before, but they wouldn't answer. I asked them: "why did you refuse to answer" "because I was getting a bit scared?" "The Lady Comrade would not let us. " She had caught the call-sign and our code and kept telling him: "Don't answer". 783, 783, Chrysanthemum, confirm. Don't tell them. Chrysanthemum, where are you? We are in Bucsani. We are safe. Any more problems at the Inspectorate? "Come to the headquarters, everybody has left. " When it started getting dark, some of the protesters left. Thank you. Over and out. We're not going to the Police. Take us to Voinesti. This is an order from the Supreme Commander of Armed Forces. Dambovita County Police Headquarters Targoviste - You say that we should search them? - Of course. Who are you to arrest me 7 I am Lieutenant-Colonel Cont Stefan from the Dambovita County Police. He is... Captain loan Boboc, Military Unit 1378. - He is... - Stirbescu. - And he is... - lonescu. Representatives of the masses. Platoon Leader Paise. Begin the search! And why do you want to search me and my husband? Comrade Ceausescu, you are not supposed to carry any dubious items. - I am not carrying anything. - Let's see! Nothing. Comrade President, I was ordered to protect you! - Who are you? - An officer of the Romanian army. What's your name? Major Mares lon, of the Military Unit 1378. - And where do you want to lake us 7 - To a nearby military base. Headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania December 22, 1989, 20:00 We were informed that he had been captured near Targoviste. When the nexus is confirmed, we will make a public announcement He will be arrested and made to stand trial! Let him stand trial! On trial! On trial! She, too! She, too! Both of them! Both of them! Comrade President, I am Major Tecu lon, of the Military Unit 1417, Targoviste, designated CO in the Commander's absence. We are at your disposal in order to protect and defend you. What are your orders? I refuse to talk to you. Bring me the CO. He cant come now. He must calm down the protesters. Yes. What are you planning to do 7 As I said, we are to defend you. And who are you taking orders from'! From our superior officers. Fine, fine, but whose orders? From Comrade General Gusa. He commands the army. Gusa is a traitor. Do not obey his orders. Obey the orders of General Stanculescu. He is your Minister. I signed the appointment decree this morning. lon lliescu had said the same thing. lon Mares, former Deputy Commander Unit 1417, Targoviste lon Mares, former Deputy Commander Unit 1417, Targoviste To obey Stanculescu. Both Ceausescu and lon lliescu told us to obey Stanculescu. This scared us even more. We had no idea what was happening. I was in a dog eat dog situation. li was either him or me. That's what Militaru and Stanculescu told me: "Your life is in their hands. " "You will answer with your life. " Those were the kind of threats made against me. But I was also thinking hat, should Ceausescu survive, it would be the end of us. We were responsible for holding him there, for not allowing him to contact... I don't know... his trusted structures or somebody. We had practically removed him from his job. I would say that Ceausescu was removed from his position as President, as Secretary General, the moment he entered the barracks of my unit. The first thing he asked was how he could contact The Ministry of Defense or some people in Bucharest I told him the lines were busy and that we, too, had trouble reaching anybody. My first concern when he entered the office he was quartered in, the one I showed you, with the beds and all that, was to prevent him from using the phones. I asked them if they wanted something to eat. Firstly they denied and asked for mineral water. I said: 'Where would we get mineral water from '2" "The stores are either ransacked or closed. " That's what We had heard. Later we found out that it was no true. But I said I should bring them some food and he accepted. Sugar! What are you doing 7 Do you want to kill the Comrade? - Don't you know he has diabetes? - How could we know that? Bring the Comrade President tea with no sugar and never add sugar to his drinks again. Comrade President, we will leave you alone while you eat. We're turning a new page in Romania's political and economic life. In this time of trouble, we have decided to establish the National Salvation Front, whose main support is the Romanian Army, and which brings together all the healthy social forces, without ethnic discrimination, and all the organizations and groups that rose courageously to defend freedom and dignity during the time got the totalitarian tyranny. The purpose of the National Salvation Front is to bring democracy, freedom and dignity to the Romanian people. I can't believe it. After all the things we've done for the country and the people. And now they mock us. Organize a coup. You know about Timisoara, don! you 'I I wasn't me who gave the order to kill people! Don! pay attention to him. The people will see that the traitors have turned against the country. What's your name? Where are you from? From Pitesti. And you don'! like how the city looks now? Is this how it looked like in your parent's days? We've done so much for Pitesti. May I... Go ahead. Why did you leave the Central Committee? I made a mistake. I shouldn't have left I should've stayed and told the people... Who's in charge now? Iliescu. Who? Iliescu. Who is that? What don't you know who he is? Who? Iliescu... that one... Ah! That one. They wouldn't let me finish him. And neither would you... It's all your fault. You did not let me sack Milea and Gusa, the traitors who Will destroy Romania! Down! Down! Everybody down! What are you doing, boy '2 Stay down to avoid getting shot! Who's firing? Terrorists, who else! Who 7 Who's firing? How would I know? Goddamn terrorists! The problem was that. they appeared... ...what's their name... I forgot... ...terrorists appeared. Almost every night that Ceausescu spent there, the barracks was the target of diversionary actions. Today I realize they were diversions, but back then I thought we were under attack, both from the high school, the railroad station, and from the other side, from the blocks of flats. But there were only muzzle flash simulators, there were various lights, and the fired, untrained and frightened soldiers, who were carrying live ammunition, tried to take matters in their own hands and to become heroes by shooting a terrorist. All the locals started calling every time they saw some stranger: "I saw somewhere a man, dressed in khakis. He's sneaking. " Or: "There's a man carrying a weapon, an assault rifle or something. " Studio 4 of the Romanian Television December 22, 1989, 23:00 We call on you again to stay awake! Awake, Romanian! You have slept enough! Today is not the time to sleep, but to fight and die for democracy and freedom! Come, brothers... Come, brothers! Patriotic Guards, military units, do not sleep! This night is not for sleeping! This is our night! Bring your APC's, defend us, defend... Our future is being decided now! Now! This day... night! Can you provide an APC? That would take us to the Voinesti-Campulung area? I want to stay in a proper house. You are not safe. People are still after you. I'll give you money, promote you, everything you want. We can't leave. We are surrounded by protesters and terrorists just waiting fora chance lo get you. I don't know. Let's wait for things to calm down and then we'll leave. Very well. We'll leave at 2-3 AM when things calm down. Headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania December 22, 1989, 24:00 Nobody's firing on you, nobody has died, despite the explosion of incendiary devices, gas cylinders! This is the army firing! This is the army firing! Thousands of bullets were fired and nobody is dead! Let everybody go out into the square! Nothing prevents us from going forward into history! Don't leave! Come on, people! The revolution is within us! Let its flame burn brightly! The worst thing happened on the morning of 23, at 6:05 AM. I was in Kemenici's office and he talking on the army line with people in Bucharest when the town phone rang and I picked it up. A very determined voice told me: "Unless you hand over the traitors at the gate within half an hour," "we're going to raze the barracks. " "Fine, but who are you 7" He said: 'Aren't you Kemenici '2' "No, I'm Major Mares. ". "Get me Kemenici. ' What traitors are you talking about? I don't understand. Who are you? Hello? Hello? Who are you? Hello! The screens of radar stations started showing airborne targets and the barracks came under heavy fire from the ground. I had never seen anything like it, not even at the Cape Midia firing range. Julian Stoica, former Officer Unit 1417, Targoviste Major Tecu came around 6 AM and told me that the CO had ordered to prepare the two, to take them out of the command sector, to get them into a mobile command point and take it to the batteries, in Area 2, in the middle of the batteries that were on permanent alert. And he told me: "Think about how to dress them. " They were still dressed in civilian clothes. "Maybe they have to leave after sunrise. " "Someone could recognize them. " Why have we stopped? We're staying here. Why don't you take us where you promised to? We are not safe. When we will be safe, we'll take you there. The driver was very scared. "What are you up to?" "What are you going to do 7 I don't want to be involved. " I calmed him down. I told him: "You stay with the car and mind your business. " "If we have to leave, we will go someplace else. " I took his assault rifle. We spent around 30 minutes there. It was around 9.30 AM, on December 23. I was under the camouflage net, gun in hand, thinking what I could do in such a situation. - Is that the Steelworks? - Yes, that is the Steelworks. Take me to my workers there! It's impossible! You are inside a military unit I have order to protect to you. Take me to my workers! Fine, go! Take her, but you can't go more than 25 steps. They'll shoot you with everything they got, they'll even use grenades. Get in the car! Watch your mouth when you speak to the Comrade! Get in, please! Calm down. You are not allowed to get excited. Get in. You are so young and refuse to obey the orders of your Supreme Commander. What's your name? I am an officer of the Romanian army. My mission is to defend you and you're making trouble for me. And I told you to keep quiet If they find out you're here... We should put together an armored column and drive to Bucharest Give me your gun with 30 bullets and an armored carrier and two tanks and we'll go to the Central Committee. And to the television station. To inform the people of the treason that took place! To inform the workers that foreign agents are behind the coup! - It's impossible! Impossible! - This is not possible. The situation in Bucharest is difficult. The terrorists from your guard opened fire. You are not true communists. This is an order from your Supreme Commander! I understand, I understand, but I obey the orders of my direct superior officer. Take me to your commander! It's not possible at this time! I'm leaving! - I'm leaving! - Please! I'll go to the road, find a car and go to Bucharest! Sit down, please! Sit down! I can't sit here while the country is taken over by traitors! Please! Sit down, sit down! He needs to eat A little and often. And he needs his medication. Send word to Bucharest to bring his medication. Tecu came by with some food. Ceausescu was hungry, he hadn't had anything to eat. The food we had was not okay. So he brought some rye bread, some salted cheese, two salamis, the salamis of those times... Salami! This is salami for me? This is cheese for... I told you last night, we'd be happy to have salami and cheese like this everyday. You eat it. You haven't had anything either... Come on. Have some. Do you know what the situation is in Bucharest? There was a TV in the mess hall and I heard some news. Who's in charge of the army 7 General Militaru. Who? He's a KGB agent! Because of the criminal actions taken by gangs of terrorists trained to fight against the masses and to defend the dictator the council could not work properly today. We were forced to focus on coordinating the fight against the terrorists. The existence of these groups of terrorists, of fanatical individuals, who act with unprecedented cruelty, shooting at houses, at citizens, killing soldiers. It shows clearly that the dictatorship is against the people. You're not sleeping? No. May I? These are tragic moments for the Romanian people. Look, up on the television building's roof, the Romanian Army is taking up defensive positions against the terrorists, not against the population. Against he thieves who keep attacking us, but whose numbers are decreasing. The snake is destroyed. The army is on the people's side and the people is on the army's side. You came from Boteni on the first day. We came from Boteni right on the first day, on the evening of 22. You had some work to do here, right? We had a lot of work to do from the start. We've been busy broadcasting and we heard some things, but we have no idea what the situation is. We can't tell the rumors from the truth. Were mere really terrorists here? Yes, there were terrorists. All around the television building, in the surrounding houses... We know that we've been under fire, but have you captured terrorists inside the building as it was said, floor by floor? Not floor by floor. There were some downstairs, on the ground floor. We found dead terrorists. Was the television building mined? Yes, we've found mines in the basement and we're sure the terrorists have fired on us from the pavilion. Down! Down! On the floor! lon Tecu, former Deputy Commander Unit 1417, Targoviste Somebody launched an attack against the base, with several squads. We had more than 1,200 troops from 4 units. Somebody told them to provoke us, especially from the direction that their window looked on. The soldiers fire back and the commanding officer says: "we must kill the two because we cannot defend them". lon Mares, former Deputy Commander Unit 1417, Targoviste I was summoned together with Major Tecu in the office of Colonel Kemenici and he told me: "lon, you shoot Nicolae Ceausescu," "Tecu, you shoot Elena Ceausescu" "and then save yourselves any way you can, "If the barracks is overrun!“ That was the second moment of horror for me. My first thought was: "How could I shoot somebody?" How could I shoot somebody, because I have a gun and cartridges, somebody who's standing next to me? A harmless man. He could no longer issue any orders. Julian Stoica, former Officer Unit 1417, Targoviste The order I got on 24 to empty a clip into each one of them matches the order that was sent from Bucharest: "Take action. " It was sent by Stanculescu and Voican. I know about it Somebody wrote about it in a book. And they have never denied it. The time frame matches. The time frame of killing the two without trial. Andrei Kemenici, former Commander Targoviste Garrison I have not received an order from the superior officers. Nobody could give me such and order. Who could order that? To kill them. They could have ordered it, but they didn't. Or I could have taken it upon myself, if I had wanted to die, as some people think, but it's absurd. I could have sent them to the base's gate. The revolutionaries would have lynched them. Everything that happened to us in the barracks had only one purpose: we were supposed to kill them without trial. Who screams like that? The pigs. The pigs are being slaughtered. Tomorrow it's Christmas Day. Shame on you! The country is in such a slate and you slaughter pigs 'I Yes, we do, Comrade. There are hundreds of troops in this garrison and they must be fed. Listen. Go and tell the CO to give you some money to buy me a new shin. This one is dirty. And tell him that today I'm going to eat with the officers in the mess hall. I will tell them that the country was betrayed. In these moments, it was found that foreign mercenary forces have conducted operations, according to their orders, on Romanian territory in order to defend the former tyrant. These troops attacked the peaceful population of several cities across the country. Somebody said at this microphone that there are Arab terrorists. Ifs not true! They are Romanians. Wait a minute, even the television said... No Arab was caught! No foreigners were caught! They are our prisoners... It's a mistake! They're only anti-terror troops. Only Romanian troops! The television said last night that there was foreign involvement, but it was later retracted. A colonel, whose name we will not reveal, told us that Mo Indians had been caught It's a lie! These are your men, mister! Your spokesmen! Our troops speak only through the official channels. On trial! On trial! No, you can't! You are not allowed! What are you doing 7 When they see me, they will stop this foolishness! - I need to speak... - I can? let you! Hey! Hey! Comrade! Why are you hitting the Supreme Commander? Help! The madman, the thief had beaten the Comrade! - Why are you beating him? - What's going on? This man wanted to kill the Comrade! Colonel, this traitor has hit the Supreme Commander! I want him put on trial and sentenced! I wanted to address the people! I couldn't let him! If the people find out he's here, they'll kill him. I request to be replaced, I can't take it anymore. Boboc, take position outside the door. Understood, sir! Stoica, you will provide protection inside. Understood, sir! “Hm After he had calmed down a little, he kept speaking to Boboc or to me: "you would pay dearly for your actions" and so on, that communism was necessary in Romania. He spoke about his achievements and things like that And I couldn't take it anymore after a day full of stress and I told him: "You know what 7" "Communism and socialism aren't worth anything in this country anymore. " I expected him to have an equally rough reaction. It was shocking and I won't forget it till the day I die. He started to smile. He put an arm on my shoulder to calm me down and he said: "Kid" or "Young man": "You are too young to understand certain things. ' "Communism and socialism will always survive in this country through their grassroots structures. " You can imagine that I didn't think then to analyze the truth in his words. But he was right, absolutely right I can see it now, 21-22 years later. Then he made what I call his oral will. He said: 'After we're dealt with, one way or another, there will be nothing left of this country. " I want an APC to take me to Voinesti-Campulung. I'll give you anything you want. Money, rank, anything. It's useless. Get back to your place! We hadn't slept at all for three days and nights. And Kemenici decided then to take them to Bucharest. It was when he informed Stanculescu of his decision, on the evening of 24, that Stanculescu decided to come to Targoviste. It was us who forced him to do that. Jilava Penitentiary Victor Atanasie Stanculescu former Minister of Defense This was the turning point. I told him not to let anybody near the barracks use the forces for defense and put them in an APC and drive them around for safely reasons. This is where I was arrested when I was underground. They caught me once in Targoviste and now I ended up back here. Let's go. Wait. A parcel from Bucharest for you. These are my drugs, but I can't take them. I drank tea. I'll take them tomorrow. Let's go! On the morning of December 25, I was expecting the worst. Tecu came and said: "We're going back to the barracks. We're taking the APC's back. " We were back where we started. We drove back There were no incidents. We took them out of the APC, cold and stiff after spending the night in a cramped space, covered with blankets. We gave each a cup of unsweetened tea. Where are we going? Away from here. Stanculescu had no flight path to Targoviste. I would've known about it He came with five helicopters without an authorization. I told to Kemenici: "I'll make a sign with a yellow scarf when we arrive. " "I will be in the first helicopter. " "There will be five helicopters and I will ride in the first one. “ "I'll keep the scarf with me, on the right side. " It was the inspiration, the cool heads of some CO's because there were more than 32 unit commanders along the way and they had orders to shoal on the spot any group of more than two helicopters that did not carry a yellow scarf. "Fire on anything that flies. No flying object is ours. " "They are enemies'. And it was with this order in mind that we greeted the five helicopters. Stanculescu and those in Bucharest did not know that Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu were here. The soldiers also did know. We feared for their lives. We wanted to hand them over to Stanculescu alive for whatever he wanted to do with them. What's going on '2 Who's there? Stay calm, it's Stanculescu. We're saved. Victor won't let us die. There are still some patriots left in this country, not only traitors. “Hm Careful, we're filming! Ready! Bring them out! We're bringing them out. Come on.
