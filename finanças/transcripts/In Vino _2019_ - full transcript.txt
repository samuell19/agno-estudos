BACK TRANSLATED FROM ROMANIAN ADAPTATION BY B.F.D. I give up. I don't believe any of this. However, it is very true. Unbelievable, but true. I challenge you to see if he understood anything. Listen here. January 27, 1995 Charles Bouitton's 80th birthday. Do you remember him? It made a lot of "noise". A lifetime in the spotlight. He reached the front page of the newspapers, not remembering how many times. But some of those newspaper headlines "hit" back. With revenge . This is Jean. The Butler. You know... you always need a butler. Get in. Here it is. Charles Bouitton one of the most powerful men of the time. A billionaire. A rich billionaire. And of course... Linda. His third wife. I'm sure you recognize her. Isn't she gorgeous? It's time. Did they all come? Yes, sir. All. Yes indeed, they all came. I mean his family. This is Josh, his nephew. And Magdalen his future ex. One more? Refrain. Go and fuck yourself. I'm coming down right away. You go ahead, Linda. Charles' niece, Melissa and her husband Larry. Don Perignon. It starts again, it ignores me. What the? Nobody likes it. All right, but don't take long. I don't want to mess with your "rats". His children, Luke and Christian. God help. Clit. They finally realized. Shut up. What the? It's a hoax. That may be so. A malformation that produces two bottoms. What to see. Your answers are wrong my dear. Just by marrying you. Paulette, his sister. Be careful here. Maurice, gift tamer or tax deductor as you prefer. Have finished? Yeah, I just wanted to... say something. Maurice, you're the only man I know who can supports something without marking anything. - Paulette, you are invaluable. - Yes, that's what I tell myself. And finally Charles' cousin, Clara Bouitton. It is said that he once even faced a cobra. He charges her with an identity crisis. Maurice! I understand that some people can't stand alcohol. But first you have to drink it. Do you need anything else, sir? Not now. What do you think is happening? I'm not playing with you. I'm just asking. Paulette, how cute. One of your priceless beaver furs. Yes, hands down, dear Magdalen, you just don't want to wake her up. Maybe I want to. I think this would be the only opportunity to resurrect this party. How strange to notice the prerogative caught in their own trap of freedom. And delicious. He better not let her out of the sanitarium. It's an asylum, Clara, and it's mine. I come and go as I please. Not if it was the way I wanted it. Look at him. What is he thinking? Not that it matters in any way. Things will happen no matter what. My dear Frankie, please bring more drinks. I want to forget what I'm going to remember. NOTHING WILL BE MORE (NO MORE BETS = BETS WERE MADE) Here's the thing. He fell on the steps of the house. In fact, someone pushed him. Who did it? His wife. His children. Or one of the other "rats"? Each of them believed that this was their end. But actually... it was just the beginning. The health of billionaire Charlea Bouitton remains unknown after the accidental fall since celebrating his 80th birthday just 2 weeks ago. The Bouitton family is back on the front page of every newspaper a year after Charles's daughter was abducted and released and only a few months after the theft of the famous 27-carat ruby ​​necklace worth $ 11 million. Jesus. Not just me. We are on all channels again. They are on all channels again. I told him to stop finding out their secrets. I am a special race. They are those 1% of those 1%. And? So damn your job. Exact. The history of this family raises many questions regarding the fall. Sources in the family entourage support the hypothesis of a crime. Was the fall an accident? I don't understand you, Charles. What does he say? Rida blast. What this means? Nothing at all. Jean! He's trying to tell us something. Charles, what is it? I think we should call the doctor back. Maybe an exorcist. What is it, Charles? Suddenly I feel Italian. With all their specific features. What else does that mean? A miracle? Or a prank because I want to tell you very quickly that I don't believe in miracles. - Who are you? - Mrs. Pruitt. And you know it well. Yes I know her. And I'm still trying to forget. If that's a joke of yours, too I left here, do you understand me? But my dear, no matter how beautiful you are anger doesn't hold you back at all. I am above anger I am completely confused. As you know, I'm not going to die until I'm well and ready. But now I'm fine... but not nearly ready. However, one thing became very clear to me while I was floating... between conscious and unconscious. What? The future. You can leave. Nobody's leaving. No one. I won't say another word until at least one witness comes to my choice. Stop being so childish. Childish, me (me)? Childish? I'm looking at you, Linda, my wife, my beautiful wife which I now realize you could be the one who pushed me up the stairs. I refuse to be a character in your third grade story. If you think your family wants you dead, then do it. "Leave me alone." - All right, all right. Then look at me, directly at me. Tell me if you really care about me. What would you say? It doesn't matter what I say. Who hired Sister Ratched here? I hired her. She is the best in her field. Exactly what I was saying. You are one of them. One of them. We all know they want me to die. Then very well, I will not stand to see this nonsense in front of them. Where are you going? My dear, my dear, listen. Maybe it's time for my lawyers to start talking to your lawyers. You're too poor to make such a threat, my dear. - Linda! - Yes. Take this with you. - I don't like... - I don't like... you. Take your pelican legs and get out of here. Old and unbearable old man. Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean Don't be in such a hurry Jean. Foot massage. A very strange family. I wonder who will be the next to fall down the stairs. Ciao. You almost tricked us with the trick with the Italian prepared for death. But... Sir, I think you would be more than helpful if you could tell me what the prank is. What prank? I'm not kidding about anything. I'm trying to cope with the situation. Situation, do you understand what I mean? Yes, sir. But is this situation so different from all other situations? - Shut up. - Yes, sir. I will say something very profound. What the hell was I thinking when I did that? Sir? Linda was right. I'm the victim of a pathetic family plot of mysterious murder. My own family. Looks like an idea is about to come up. You're definitely right. Frankie! It's just you, keep quiet. Because of you, he's going to fire us both. Don't you think I have a right to know what's going on in this house? The answer to your question is NO. Are you telling me you're not at all curious to find out what's going on beyond? Is that what happened? To spy? Ask Octopussy here, I have other things to do. Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, stop. You need to stop these. You've seen too many soap operas. You just wouldn't want to... Maybe I'd like you to... Get back to work. "Be careful where you go, butler." "I'm sorry, ma'am." It's not for me. Is he dying or making fun of us? He's dying, but he's making fun of us. I thought so too. "I'm leaving tomorrow morning." - I thought so. What he wants? He wants everyone here. Hey! Are there really no rules in this house at all? I thought breaking the rules was the new rule in this house. "With Magdalen's departure." "And Mr. Bouitton's resuscitation." And where is the house monster? In his office. It's time to dump him. That's all you're up to, that's my job. It scares me the most. And as I always say: better outside than inside. Smoke again and drink again. That's how we men survive when we see you. Let's hope you don't. Stop! Stop! - Please stop. - Stop what? Stop what? Your existence. - Your pills. - You take them. Shall I knock you to the ground? Sharon Stone told me that once. In a dream. Where else. Now you're gone. Still a ruffled old man. Jean. Sir? Will they all participate? Yes sir, everyone will come. An idea came to me. For which I will become famous or for which I will become invaluable. I don't know yet which one I prefer. Did you understand me? Not sir. You pray? If necessary, sir. Then go and pray. Why does it always bother you when someone feels good? Yes. - Linda. - Oh, it was you. How are you? The reason for my existence. My perforated ulcer. - What do you want Charles? - You look naked to me. I will not take part in this pathetic meanness, I will not return. Listen to me for a moment. What are you going to say? That you're sorry. Not at all. I just want you to listen. I'll tell you something that will shock you. Are you still there? Yes, yes, you said you wanted to shock me, although I don't think you'll succeed, but give it a try. I'm going to do something that has never been done to you before. I will trust you. I wouldn't do this for you because I'll figure out what you're going to do. I know I know. I have always believed in evil minds that think the same way. They will all come in two days. I want you on my side. I'm sorry I won't be available. What if I offered you... double your 72 million? Now everything was like a book. The night of the 18th, the following Friday night. But what do you do when you don't want a witness? Get rid of the servants. You "play" too much with him. Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you. You better tell me everything later. Let the games begin. - You're still here. - Excuse me? I made a bet with myself. Then you will definitely win. My bet is you're not a real butler but you're actually an actor... who plays the role of butler actually very unconvincing. What a splendid imagination you have, you should be a writer. What kind of writer, concrete or fictional? Maurice, three husbands, two world wars and even the Titanic they didn't knock me down but these rattles could be fatal to me. Can you sing anything else? I apologize to everyone. - Chopin, sometimes I get lost in them. - Good idea. - Which? - Get lost. Jean, honey, is it true that Linda is gone? Finally. It's none of my business to say anything, ma'am. Aha, so it's true. Buttocks, wigs and bald heads. What a nice view. Doesn't it look so much better? Hi all. How is your poor leg? After that fall, I was so scared of you. I wonder, didn't you push me up the stairs? In your place I would not wait for an acknowledgment of the deed. He's always kidding. Daddy, you worried us all. You look good, Dad. I'm better now, I'm better now. You weren't the one who pushed me up the stairs, were you? What an ugly thing to say. Remember we come from the same family. If I wanted to kill you, I certainly wouldn't have this conversation now. I'm so proud of him. What a strange thing to say. That we keep talking about weird things. Why are we all here together again at the same time? Strange you asked that. Time is of the essence. Not to mention the detours. I don't have to avoid you, do you, Aunt Clara? No, you don't have to, but you still do that, don't you? I should have said that, but that's right. Finally, as soon as everything is ready in the room where we will have dinner we will all go there and... we will solve the problem. - Everything is ready. "Just in time, Jean." Come on, come on, come on. Everyone after me. Come on, vulvae. ( Cunts = vagina, vulva ) See you upstairs. Maurice doesn't touch me. You may have noticed that we all gathered here. But still... we're not all here. I'm glad Daddy, I'm proud of you. To get rid of a leech, you really need cold blood and big balls. And we all know how cold your balls are. Just so you know, it's a family heirloom. You can tell, Dad, it was definitely Linda who pushed you. Is it true Charles can we finally talk about Linda in the past tense? As long as I'm in the spotlight, you can use whatever time you want, Paulette. - The end of the first part. "Just like a play." ... by her smell. How invigorating, for the first time since I joined this family I never thought I'd hear anything like that TRUTH And because we all tell the truth in front of us, the feeling is mutual. I have to admit it has a magnificent style. You have Linda style. Let's get things done. What do you do? What's going on? Yes, Uncle Charles, what do you care? The future worries me. In fact, your future. Because of what happened this year... how can I express myself better? Of unusual events. Unusual events? Yes, kidnapping, theft, attempted murder unusual events do not you think? Depends. I'm not even asking you what you mean by that. - Why? "Because you're going to tell me." Quiet. I'm not done talking yet. Now, we need to talk about my wealth. Or if you prefer your inheritances. If there is one. Some decisions need to be made. Now that I'm facing death face to face. Good evening. Charles, are you dying? We are all there. It's just a matter of time. And you are the ones I stayed with. My dear sister Paulette and her husband Maurice. How long have you been married? I don't really want to know, no, no. Maurice, hell will come as no surprise to you. I often wondered how this would end. Who will kill whom. Looks like we'll never know. If not... you will do something extremely unusual tonight. But just so you know, I'm not forcing you on anything. Josh! That's my Boy. You look exactly like my brother gone from us. And I'm not necessarily saying that's a good thing. Oh, well, it's going to be one of those "regular" evenings, isn't it? I don't know what "ordinary" evenings you're talking about. You know, the best thing you've ever done it was to marry Magdalen. Charles, how nice of you to say such a thing. Well, my dear, you two really deserve each other. My dear Melissa and her husband Larry my trusted accountant. (C.P.A = PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT CERTIFIED) I'm not going to tell you how I really feel about you. Because I feel very kind tonight. Charles! If I didn't know you, I'd be offended. Isn't that funny? Who are you really? Aunt Clara! An unsinkable battleship. Not that we wouldn't have tried. Be careful you're about to say something serious by mistake. Never. Never, never, never, never, never. Yes, because we are talking about mistakes. Luke and Kristen my joys and pride. But also my punishments. It's not my fault if I'm not the way you wanted me to be. Yes, it was ugly of you to say such a thing. Sit down. - Good. - Yes, sir. The righteous are well trained. And finally my wife Linda. The third wife. The biggest disappointment. Honey, you're making me blush. You, all those with legal minds. I imagine where the phrase "poisonous fruit" comes from. It's the fruit that came out of something very rotten. Well, I also benefited from such fruits repeatedly. And now I've finally discovered that I am I myself was the poisonous tree. What the hell are you talking about there? I kept torturing myself thinking about it. Oh my God. To whom do I leave my fortune? But more importantly WHY? Good luck. Yes, a damn curse. But all my options are here. So I decided not to make any decisions. Charles, suspense kills me. Who will make this decision if not you? You. I propose a toast. Let's not waste this wonderful Chateau Lafite. For your destinies. Which of I do not know what inexplicable reasons they are somehow related to mine. FOR DESTINY. (All in chorus) FOR DESTINY. Now, I have one more thing to say. - Someone call an ambulance. - Damn it. The telephone does not work. He has no pulse. Do something. What else do you want me to do? Went. Went? What do you mean he left? Dead. He left, dead and gone. Linda, you heard me dead. He's dead. Yes, I know, can you let me enjoy this moment for a few moments? He's your husband. You're causing me a headache. Charles, come on, honey, what do you want to prove with this? It's one of your crazy pranks. Maurice, if you don't mind, you're the doctor in this room. - Yes Yes Yes. - Get up. Of course. Sorry everyone, I seem to be allergic to death. Enough with this nonsense, I'm sorry. Someone wake Maurice. All right, Uncle Charles. It's not fun at all. Are you done playing with the corpse? I don't think he's dead at all. Good. See for yourself. Agatha, please, she wasn't a beauty even when she was alive so please spare us the show. Linda! Do you realize what's going on? Your husband is dead. I know, my dear. But you don't. Charles is dead because I killed him. What the? Shut up, everyone. I'm not going to say I killed him to take advantage of you although in a certain way you will take advantage. You won't get out of this. This is murder. Come on now. You know very well that if it weren't for me one of you would have tried at some point. By the way, who pushed him? I don't care at all. Although I would definitely like my necklace back. My mother's necklace. Calm down and listen. Shall we calm down? How to calm down? - You just killed... - $ 2.7 billion. 50% are of course mine. And the rest of you pathetic leeches you can share. Did you do all this for money? Strange is the fact that I knew I was in a strange situation like you idiots but I could never have created such a brilliant plan. Do you know who the genius behind this plan is? Charles. - Don't be ridiculous. - It's absurd. Are you telling me it was Charle's idea to die? No no. Charles' idea was to poison one of you. I just had to be an accomplice. Two days ago he called me and told me he had a grand plan. I had a long conversation on the phone. Isn't that right, Jean? After his accidental fall he entered a philosophical state. He began to say, "What the hell?" He was very disappointed in you. Well, all of us. But I came into his life later so the mutual hatred quickly ended. So he offered me $ 72 million to be with him, so to speak. $ 72 million? Yeah, I know, that sounds good, doesn't it? But not as good as 1.35 billion m. What was the idea itself? - What time is it? - 8 and a quarter. Well, time is of the essence. That is, because one of you will die tonight. That's it, this put a lid on it, we're leaving here. Then hurry because you only have 54 minutes to live. 53. That indescribable taste of Chateau Lafite was poison. Poison? That's how you killed my father. You're such a good detective. - Yes, it took exactly 58 minutes. - 57. So... the effect is flawless as is the antidote. Antidote? Yes, I have the antidote for eight of you but you will decide who will be the poor sacrificial lamb. Only in this way can we enjoy these billions with a certain... pleasure. I apologize if I keep repeating myself but, "What the hell are you talking about there?" Charles' main idea was to poison one of you and to ensure a carefree life for others or in prison. I saw a much better opportunity. I have decided to leave you the presumption of innocence and I poisoned him instead. In fact, that's why we're all here now. Looking to the future with great joy and a lot of money. But that big pile of money is not who knows what when we only have 53 minutes to live. 52. Shut up. Who are you, the harbinger of the end. It definitely looks like one. It's ridiculous. What kind of poison can kill you in exactly one hour? Dendroaspis polylepis. Or better known as the Black Mamba. South African tribes use them to poison arrowheads. I thought you were English. 2nd generation Johannesburg. And at first I was skeptical of the accuracy with which he worked Some of you think you already feel some of the symptoms. Metallic taste in your mouth, excessive salivation, sweating Heat waves. You've completely lost your mind Linda. End this crazy game and give us the antidote immediately. I'll call the police. You're going to have to scream really loud because as you noticed it doesn't work. Your grand plan has a big flaw. What will stop us from cutting your neck? I am many steps ahead of you, my dear even if you walk straight and not on 7 paths. Agatha! My coat, my purse. I'll take care of it right away, my dear. Hello, hello, my dear. Look at her. What do you want Linda? What do you want? He wants to buy us silence. She wants us on her side when the police come. Of course I want silence from you. But I don't trust you at all. If my future is in your hands I want your hands to be as dirty as mine. Now... Since it's late, I'll leave you in the hands of my base man Jean. He knows what to do when to do it. He knows what to say and when to say it. As for me, I'm leaving. Or... so to speak... I haven't been here at all. Come on, Agatha, our guests have a crime to discuss. That's exactly what happened. But who will believe. He left them there under the threat of a gun, poisoned with a corpse in the dining room and in less than an hour to kill... or be killed. I refuse to be at the mercy of a crazy woman. And I refuse. But then what happens? After the refusal I mean. Cre... cre... I think I'm going to... faint. Already? It's too early just fainted. Again. We were all poisoned. - We should all vomit. - How do we do that? Put two fingers around your neck and think about poverty. I realized you're not who you say you are, are you? Butler, ha, on horseback. How much does he pay you? That seems enough. That's it, they're gone. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are kind enough to follow me in... ...living room I'll explain everything to you. Do we have a choice? "My hero." Is someone? With fewer and fewer minutes available the only way to end it all was to end Linda's absurd game. Do not worry. I'm fine. That you think. If I think about it, I think I'll faint again. Jean was appointed stage manager. But as you know, in any circus performance the stage manager tends to make... a quieter entrance. Ladies and gentlemen, listen to me a little, please. The idea is to create a scenario that the police can... swallow. You have less than 50 minutes to choose a victim. Who among you deserves or is willing to die. For the common good. The chosen one will be killed by his own hands his or hers. A suicide. Who killed Charles? Can it be him? Or she, maybe Inspector? Dead or dead. She or he killed Charles in front of everyone before he or she ends his or her own life. It was horrible. I see that your intelligent minds do not understand what I mean. Let me tell you more clearly. As soon as you have chosen a "winner" you will kill him or her with a single shot to the head. To look like a suicide. Then you take the pistol and point it at Mr. Bouitton and you will kill him too. Again. Wait a minute. Why do we have to kill Charles again? To make it look like the killer shot Mr. Bouitton then he took his or her own life. That way you will all be witnesses and you will testify about a murder and a suicide to which you will all have an alibi. No research will take place no autopsy and you will all be free and unsuspected. You will all consent to die, of course. If everything is done correctly, all 1.35 billion will be yours to which the amount of... $ 168 million each. If there's an antidote, you'll give it to me right now. Do the wrong thing, sir. If I suffer something then you too will suffer something. I'm glad you finally see this isn't a joke, sir. Okay, the antidote has to be in the house, right? 1950 square meters and 45 minutes. I'm just saying too. We should escape and go for help. The nearest hospital is half an hour away. No road traffic. Do the calculations yourself. There seems to be a more practical solution to this dilemma. Let's kill someone. If you don't have any more questions, I'll retire to let you think. I didn't mean to make fun of you. It didn't take long for the "rats" to return to the obvious solution. Rats, you know. Evident. Don't even think about it. I know it sounds horrible, but come on, Aunt Clara it's an easy decision, you've lived your life even longer. Fuck you, Larry. Do you want me to volunteer? Do you think I deserve to die instead? No, my dear, but I think we can find a... more cooperative victim. Who exactly? Maybe someone like... Please! Finish whining. Let's end this and kill the cotoro. Don't hurry, Eve Harrington. ( reference to the name of a racehorse ) As much as I would like to help you will not be able to kill me. I'm very well defended. How? You all know very well what my will says if they die of unnatural causes. Come on, now, at your age, there are no unnatural causes left. All my money instead of going to you all flies on the window at the Save the Pachyderms Foundation, a very noble cause. What you said? I love those long noses and fat butts I remember your late Uncle Gregory. Who cares? We're going to get $ 168 million each from Charles, aren't we? Let's kill her. Do you have any idea how much money I'm worth Larry? Look at these pretty, greedy faces. Do you think these hyenas would rather kill me? And lose millions. They're going to kill you and it will produce millions. Devil. Do you still want to kill the crow? Very well. Can't be Aunt Clara is too rich to be killed. Surely. But then who? Well. Then let's solve your problem democratically. Let's begin? - Shall we vote? - Why not? Why not? Tic-tac tic-tac tic-tac. - Either, let's work this out. - Let's get this over with. OK. Let's begin. Larry. Great, because I'm black, isn't it? You? We certainly didn't notice that. Maurice. What the? Who would want me to be dead? Luke. Luke. Luke. Luke. Move. Why me? Democracy. People chose. Looks like you're the main contender in this election, sir. I think the system is corrupt. Enough, let Luke be the victim. And so we are all here in this horrible nightmare because Charles was pushed up the stairs and I consider no, but I'm pretty sure Luke was the one who pushed him let him be the one to get the bullet. How convenient for me to kill my own father. Only you said you came from the same family. And you want Charles dead because you want cash quick. He knows this house better than anyone else. Come on... did you get money to cover your little one... on the stock market? Did he know about that? I didn't know, but you just told me, my dear. That inside information, Luke's entire fortune is over, you know. - Is not important. - Seriously? As Aunt Clara suggested if we want to become cold-blooded killers then let's make the most of it. Enough with the chatter. Chatter? The account number 354761999 First Royal Bank - Cayman Island. Motherfucker. What is it now? - I thought I saw a rat. - Where? In the mirror. Password. Open the door, you idiot. - Is everything going according to plan? - Like a clock. Are you sure what to do? You take care of your business and let me do it myself. - Where is? - Also at the table. I'll signal to you. What do you think of her? As if things weren't already complicated guess who decided to return. Maybe to save the day or to ruin it. - Quiet. "How I let you convince me." We go in, see what happens, and then we leave. Nothing is happening here. Is it a true story that I can tell you more? A fake reality. We will all die. Murim, murim, murim. Please lift your wreck. How much time do we have, Jean? Where is Jean? Yes, right here, 35 minutes. OK. Say it all. After which death do we profit? Whose account is it, says it all. Josh's. "He's been stealing from us for years." - How do you know? From Magdalen, of course. What the? By the way, you've been very busy. It is a lie. How could you do that? You shouldn't have gotten in my way. I mean, your wife's. What a miserable garbage you are. Josh, are you okay? Where's the gun? Sweetheart. - You wouldn't do that. - Finish. Surprise, surprise. It's like you didn't sleep with half of my girlfriends and with their sisters. It doesn't bother anyone that she's holding the gun just got out of alcohol? Rehab? Yes Dear. You've been in Betty Ford more times than Gerald Ford. I don't have a problem with drinking. Yet... Luke, present here, is not as stupid as he seems. We can all take full advantage if my husband dies. Millions and millions stolen from the company. And you've made as many trips to the Cayman Islands as I have. So you understand me. He dies, I close the bank accounts and we split in half. Let your ignorance be more understanding. I understand what he means. Ignorant yes, but I understood what he meant. I'm glad you understood. Now, come on. Someone come and get the gun from me and kill Josh. I've never been good at target shooting. What a disgusting representation. The little princess has something to say. I definitely have. You have caused this family enough humiliation. You are what the French would call: en parvenu (person who inherits money and is not already rich) You are what the Americans would call a little sow. Stop your mess and shoot yourself cheap bitch. Eat me. ( meaning ass ) Your royal dryness. Democrato. Hang balls. Alcoolico. Răpitoareo. Magdalen! Magdalen! I think alcohol fumes make you confused. You see, Kristen is not a kidnapper, she was kidnapped. Really? You told him? I did not do this. What happens here? Kidnapped, kidnapped... Potato, potato. Wake up idiots. Kristen, she was never kidnapped. Hansel and Gretel present here staged everything. To milk Charles for a $ 12 million reward. I wouldn't judge others if I were Aunt Clara in your place. Maybe we should talk about your affair with Hitler. There is too little to discuss. It was a miserable night in Vienna. He was a painter at the time. And a horrible lover if you ask me. Did you sleep with Hitler? I feel like one of those idiots in horror movies who hear strange noises and keep walking towards them. Aoleu, hold a gun. Who is that? My nephew's drug-addicted wife. Someone is coming. That was close. - Frankie! - What is it? No no no no. We have to get out of here. We have to get out of here. We have to get out of here. - We have to get out of here. - Stop. I got her out of here. They killed him. They killed Mr. Bouitton. - What are we doing now? - We're going to the police, of course. There are 27 minutes left. Look at them. Rats have lost... ( boldness ) I'm glad Charles didn't find out about your animal plan. But he still suspected something. You're pissing me off, butler, what do you mean? You understand my idea. Something strange is happening. Strange? In the style of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks? In the style of Alfred Hitchcock. Josh, he looks smarter than I thought or work with someone else. Finally you decided to look in your children's secret book. Yes, Lady Macbeth. I discovered a lot... similar ambiguities. but I don't have enough evidence. Charles, with all due disrespect, I don't care. unless in all that ambiguity you somehow found my necklace. Honey, I found a lot of necklaces. but not yours. What is this? A record. One of the last conversations between the owners of the house. I thought it would be useful to you. Of course. Now everything has become very clear. What the? That I don't know anything about what's going on here. I can continue? But that's not all One of the accounts has too much money in it, can you explain that to me? This is me. Yes, sir. All your phones have been listened to. For months. At least I'm not among them. I can't rely on you for the simplest things, Maurice. You ruined everything. You shuffled the data, you idiot. I received the deliveries a week earlier. I'm going to have to put the gorillas in your bedroom otherwise I don't know what to do with all these... chicks. Chicks? It's not me. Forgive me Paulette. So that's how you bought your beaver furs. Wait a minute. I understand now. The account with too much money in it. "Wash". Wash, wash, wash, wash lady. Were you the lady who "washed", did you take care of the windows? Either way, what's the point of denying it? Shut up. Why? We are the top importers in North America of endangered animals. Really? Importers? You mean smugglers. Is public humiliation over? Japanese? Chinese. Sir Charles, the fox. He seems to be taking care of all of us. So is Linda. And now what? I stole the necklace. Aunt Clara, do you confess? Proudly. The necklace once belonged to my mother. He should never have been next to Linda's swollen breasts. I had it stolen. Then I sold the ruby ​​to a Chinese general. Well done Clara. Straight and shiny like Sean Connory's ass. Did you sleep with Sean Connory? It was one night in Edinburgh. He was a waiter at the time. And a very gifted lover if you ask me. So my father suspected us all. Me, Luke Josh and the "sponge" here. So it's official, we're all ambitious, inventive and we are all charlatans. That's right, we're traditionalists. Yes, so what? Sue me. Or I'll shoot you. Never. This is not working properly. - Larry. "I don't know how that happened." Stupid ostrich, you always put your beak where it shouldn't. No, his beak is definitely where it needs to be. Please, Clara, pull the zipper. Otherwise... Wait a bit. Someone is missing. Melissa. Let everyone be quiet. You look great. Listen. Set him aside from me. Melissa! Honey, I'm Larry, your husband. Leaves. Melissa, please get out right now. No, you're going to kill me. You? Why you? Because nobody likes me. I don't even have a child, I don't mean anything to anyone. Is right. Once they realize we're as dirty as the others. They will have no problem blowing our heads. Concentrate, my dear, and please shut the hell up. What is he talking about? Well, Larry, figure out the numbers a little bit It started. Help Josh cover the money in the Cayman account and who can do that better than the chief accountant. Why would Larry risk everything for Josh? Because she's in love with him. What the? What?!? Come on, Larry, admit you're just as gay like the sun in Palm Springs. Melissa, shut up. I'm not gay. You're not a fan, but you're the coolest. Man, man, man. That's it, so far, I'm tired. I took it. We ask you too much to stop the clapping with your feet or suffocation, please. Shut up, Nancy. I'm tired of this bad game. - It is not like that? - Quiet. One thing I ask of you is that Maurice know where Kristen is so interested. Will he seduce you? See, no, I'll seduce Nosferatu here. How strange. A girl to seduce her own father. Come on, Paulette, I thought you were a little smarter. Look at them. The same cunning eyes. The same shape of the nose. The same stupid forgetfulness. Maurice is Kristen's father. Noooo. Yes, it is true. Are you confused? I bet you are. Good thing Jean wrote everything down. So. To recap. Josh and Magdalen steal and hide the money from the company's accounts in the Cayman account. Magdalen went to bed for information inside Luke who turned out to be Kristen's "kidnapper" with the help of the latter. And finally Larry who put the brass on his face he was bribed by Josh to hide the money stolen from Melissa. Maurice turned out to be Kristen's real father and Paulette is the leading importer of endangered animals. And Aunt Clara stole the necklace and sold the ruby ​​to a Chinese man. By the way, she slept with Hitler. And with Sean Connery if you don't mind, my dear. Let's keep the balance in the middle. ( ie equality ) What do you think you're doing? I'm just trying to help you with your problem. You have less than 20 minutes until... Until you die. True, but now I'm the boss. - Who's there. - No one. - Is anyone else in the house? - No, as far as I know. Does anyone think what I'm thinking? That would be horrible. If one of the housekeepers listens, he could call the police. We'll all get to jail. No one here must have been... wind or something. - Not again. - Fuck me. I told you: homo, homo, homo. What was that? Silence please. In the kitchen, let's go. Maurice, don't touch me anymore. - Who touched me? - Who didn't touch you? It's okay, Magdalen is silent. Did you hear that? We have a gun. Get out slowly and we won't hurt you. The last warning. Have you seen? Like I said. The wind or something. Was it Maurice? Who else. Let's get out of here. Get out of my way, get out of my way. Outside. Amateur. There wasn't much time left so Jean took over. Again. There is always something that shouldn't happen in such stories something "explosive" is about to happen. BOOOM. Do you remember? Ladies and gentlemen, pay attention to me for the last time. I'm here, I'm fine. OK. You have 10 minutes until you die. It's time to move on to Plan B. Shall I say it again? No, leave it to me. What the hell are you talking about? If so far you have not been able to find a "victim" I was ordered to let someone else make this decision. Who? To express myself exactly like Mr. Bouitton Destiny. Exact. The weapon, please. Not at all. Russian roulette. Exactly sir. I don't take part in that. Get together, please. Well, who starts. We'll go around and see who starts. Of course. Should I start? Come on Maurice. Must. My last words will be... Stop being so melodramatic, Maurice. Fuck you Paulette. To some extent I'm glad I'm going to die to come back and to haunt you, you are, dissatisfied, to be moved by... Vulva. YES. That's the word I was looking for. Listen to him, "a couple" began to grow. (balls for those who didn't know) Too late. Now I'm ready to die. I'm alive, I'm alive. Maurice, it's your turn to spin. Watch and learn how to do it. Next. That's enough. Destiny. I make my own destiny. "Jean, how much longer do we have?" "Every now and then." OK. OK. Let's go back to the room where we ate We shoot Charles in the head and end this nonsense once and for all. I'm not going to die tonight. It seems that... I'm going to have to kill. Who? I think she knows on her own. Let everyone go upstairs to the dining room. Move it. Where is? What happens here? What kind of joke is that? Charles! - Is there. - Father! Where are you? In the livingroom. Uncle Charles! Let everyone be quiet. Father! Charles, where are you? In the living room, idiots. You better be there or your mother will wriggle into the grave. - What the? - Impossible. But how? I checked your pulse, you were dead. Potassium cyanide capsules. A gift from my CIA friends. Now we put it on SFs. Josh, you forget I have billions. I can make my heart stop if that's what I want. I'll send you a whole lot of Christmas. Yes, but how is it with us with poison. - What poison? - "Weren't you trying to poison us?" Of course, I'm not the baboon here, not the baboons here. You all are. Thieves, murderers, cannibals. Just assumptions. Wrong. I'll have the proof at night. Given what happened my inheritance will not be yours but I will be yours. Everyone: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Everything was sold. Company, properties, pieces of art. $ 2.7 billion. I retired from activities. I'm going to spend my last years where you won't find me. But what about us? The whole house was full of microphones, my dear. How much information did you provide tonight? I'll send you all to jail. No money but also in prison. Would you let us kill ourselves? Open the gun. - Josh! - What the? - Josh, open the gun. - What the? Give me that damn gun. Jean has always been a master of the light hand. Aren't you going to send our own children to jail? Even if you don't believe this, I'm doing it for you. I give you a chance to atone for your sins. Take advantage of it. Pay your debts. Be honest again or move on and you will end up in the deplorable way you have become accustomed to. What a perfect timing. I say goodbye. Don't try to think too much of me. But I think I'm asking too much of you. Goodbye, my enemies. Daddy! Jean! Why do you always have interruptions when you feel good? Hello? Linda, my pet. The reason for my existence. My perforated ulcer. Charles! - You look naked. - Maybe I am. Do you enjoy the 72 million? Still do not know. Do you take care of your "demons"? Yes, my dear, with elegance, I deal, absolutely. I have to admit you were super spectacular. Finally, my dear, something we both agree on. What did you do with the two little spies? I got rid of them they knew too much. Is Jean there? Say goodbye to me. Goodbye. Charles? I was the one who pushed you. You weren't, my dear. You look so confident. As much as I would like to give you credit we both know who did it. Yes, damn it. But you didn't know I knew. I know, my dear. Hello, hello. Well, what do you expect? Did you want all the answers? I still don't know who did it. They don't want to tell me. But he paid me enough to write him the story so I won't ask any more questions. I don't know if he got what he wanted but I guess he got what he expected. I can still imagine him laughing. So do I. THE END.
