OH, HOW BEAUTIFUL PANAMA IS THE TRIP TO PANAMA I would adore you, honey and be your faithful husband. Faithful as a dog, you have to believe me. If you would only tell me your name, my beautiful child. Umm, Erich. - 7! You should take two. - That is mean! - Your turn. - 8! Show! Central, do you hear me? Here speaks the Tiger. You should connect me now with my friend. I spell: "Li-ttle Bear". Brown fur, big nose. Yes, I'll wait. Huh? What now, uh ... Another one ! Can't you be here just five minutes in peace ... - Hey! You there! - Who? - Me? - Yes. That was very decent of you. - Really decent. - Oh, it's nothing. Well well. After all, you gave me freedom. - Sure, you're welcome. Caution! - Wait a second! Wait then! At least give me the chance to return the favor! Yes, but that's a little inconvenient, you know? I have to go to the phone. Why does it take so long? Please stay on the line! Please stay on the line! Please stay on the line! Maybe some other time, okay? What if we never see each other again? Then I am forever in your debt. I actually just passing through. Well! And where to? I thought, I'll go into wide the world. The ocean and all. You don't know by chance in what direction I have to swim? Well ... I would say, downstream. Sooner or later all rivers end up into the sea. Automatically, you know? You're great. You see? I owe you something again. It's okay. I really need to ... As you say. Maybe we'll see each other again. It is always said: "It's a small world." No? Hello? Bear, is that you? It's me, your friend and Tiger. I just wanted to ask you how you're doing. How I'm doing? I thought by myself, you might be happy when I call. Just like that, without reason, I mean. That's really nice of you, Mr. Tiger. You didn't happen to also think of me, right? Ah, honestly ... Where are you, anyway? Well, hunting! Searching booty. Post! 25 kilometers! And that every day. Always the same route. Whatever the weather. Can you imagine?! Oh, what a pity. Again no letter for me. All for Tiger. Do you have a glass of water? Water? Yes, yes, of course. Why don't you finally buy a bike? I can't pay. Have no money. Everything goes to carrots. - So! - But now I must go. - Thank you! - You're welcome. I am back again! Can't be missed. I hope you have already turned on the oven. Today is my lucky day. I have the whole basket full with mushr ... Come on, we still have a garden. Should I cook the cauliflower with salt and butter? Or better, with parsley and breadcrumbs? - As you wish. - And the potatoes? Do you who prefer them sliced ​​or whole? - Yes, yes. - Yes, yes, wat? You have to choose now, Mr. Tiger. - Either or. - Best: as always. So cooked then. But roasted they taste good too. I love anything you cook. Mmmm! Now look at those raspberries! Aren't we very lucky to have such a beautiful garden? Then we never have to worry, that we are starving. As you say, Tiger, as you say! Could you set the table, Mr. Tiger? At your orders! Excuse me. How good, if you have a friend who can cook like you. This is great happiness. Happiness is, if you're not afraid of anything, Mr. Tiger. What should we be afraid of? We are doing so well. - We have everything our hearts desire. - Yes, yes. And strong we are too. I'm strong as a tiger, and you are strong as a bear. That's enough. We really have a good life here, right? - You, Bear? - What then, Tiger? - Can I ask you something? - Go ahead! I'm not sure, how to say it. You may find the question a bit strange. - It depends. - On what? Well, if it is strange. For this, you must ask it first, Mr. Tiger. Ok good. I have wondered, whether you have ever wondered, why we have never been anywhere else than here. - Elsewhere? What do you mean? - Well, if I remember clearly, we've never been further than ... Last year we even went to the other side of Rübenacker, - on the birthday of Aunt Goose. - Yes, yes, but ... See that hill over there? Have you ever wondered what lies beyond? Uhm, no. - And why not? - I don't know. I actually have something to do all day. The garden, our house, then you don't always have time to think. Yet, it would interest you, right? Well, on the other hand, what should be beyond there? Probably another hill. - Or a lake. - Yes Yes. Probably. Or another country. Another country? Maybe even the country of our dreams! Where everything is much better than here. Bigger and better, you know? Do you really think so? It might be true. Nice. This is still ... Yes, is that possible? Well, if that's not luck! Pa-na-ma. Bananas! Tiger! Look what I just found! A crate? Yes, yes, but this is not just a crate. - This one is from Panama. - Panama? Never heard of it. Me neither. In any case ... it certainly smells like bananas there. For real? I believe Panama is a country where it smells like bananas from top to bottom. That must be the land of our dreams, Bear!

Something's pinching. Then we have to get something out again. Harder! You should make yourself heavier! - How? - No idea. Think of concrete. Best ... we just take the fishing rod. And nothing else? And a pot. Believe me, this is much easier than a heavy suitcase. Well, I must say, Bear, sometimes you're a real fox. But my Tiger-duck should also join. Without him, I'm not going anywhere. So, along here or along there? Well ... a second! If you don't know the way, you really only need a signpost. Come on! Nanu! Where are you going? - We are leaving. - Going away? How travel? You can't just travel from nothing to nothing! Where will it end? Panama! Panama? Aha, does not fall under my jurisdiction. Panama is airmail. My heaven! But that's a long way, Bear! At least 3 times 2 times as long, as I thought. Well, but at the end paradise awaits us, Tiger. Do not forget that. - Look! There is someone sleeping! - Yes. - Oh, excuse me! We did not ... - Paws Off! Villains! We didn't want to disturb you ... You had figured it out! Secretly rob me! Rob? But we are not thieves. We are travelers passing through. - When we saw you sleep here ... - Then we thought ... - That someone is sleeping! - Exactly. No more. Ha! I don't believe a word of it. I don't know you at all. May I introduce: This is the little bear named "Little Bear". I'm the little tiger, called "Little Tiger". So now we know each other. And who are you? Umm, Schnuddel. What? Schnuddel! That is my name. - Uh, small Schnuddel? - What's wrong? Just Schnuddel! But you still won't get my bike. And you know why? Because it's mine. Yes, yes! But we don't want it, at all. You don't want it at all? And why not, if I may ask? Is there something wrong with it? No, no, but honestly, I do not even know how to ride that thing. Thing?! This is a tandem. Did you hear, Bear? A tandem. Oh yeah, now we are very excited. Really? Well, if so ... Get on, you can ride along for a bit. You know, the good thing about a tandem is that you can bring a friend. The bad thing about it is, that you have to have a friend. Unfortunately I don't have one. Don't you happen to have a friend, that you don't need right now? - No. - Pity. Would he at least have had long legs? - Who? - Well that friend! Don't know. No. Then it doesn't matter. What good is a friend, if he can't even reach the pedals. Well, what would he be called, this friend? What? No idea. That's something! No name and short legs! I can do without such a friend. We are there. We have to go up there. Up there ?! What, for heaven's sake, do you want there? - Well, look at what's behind it! - Well! You may be two strange birds! What great things should there be behind it? Almost! We almost made it, Tiger. We are almost in the land of our dreams. Do not know. I can't believe it. Yes, but ... But it looks just like our place! Far and wide, zero bananas. We can't even smell them. But that can never be Panama! No. Panama looks quite different. That I know. And now what? You know, Tiger. We probably just have to walk a bit further. Yes. You're probably right. Best we ask someone. Yes! Someone who knows the area. Come with me! There! Panama? Oh yeah! Then you must go left. Always left. Why exactly to the left? Because my old farmer lives on the right. And where the farmer lives, can not be Panama. To the left sounds far away. Come on. If you can't go further, I'll carry you a bit. Oh yeah! And if you can't, I will carry you. Good friends always carry together. A country where everything is bigger and better? For what? A mousehole is still big enough. Panama? Never heard of it. And it doesn't smell like bananas here either. It only smells of straw here. And now? Right or left? I have an idea. We let my Tiger-duck decide. He is never wrong.. Go! Well, please! I knew I could count on him. Now, come on, Bear. - Is it still far? - No, not really. There! What are you thinking now, Tiger? Hm ... our umbrella. Hey, Bear? How good, if you have a friend who can build a shelter. Hey, Tiger, look! It stopped. The rain is over! Today is a good day. Bet? How about a formidable breakfast? I will catch us a fish. What is it? Funny. I don't see any river. Without a river, the best fishing rod won't help, Tiger. 5.611, 5.307, 5.411, 5.209, - 5519 ... - Oh well! This afternoon at the latest, when we get there, we can catch as many fish as we want. I bet that in Panama, you only have to keep the pan above the water and the trouts jump in like that. For dessert we eat blueberries, yes? Just like home, directly from the forest. Or raspberries. Or all together. It tickles my tongue already, when I think about it. Why do you count all the time? Well, for safety. If we are lost, we only have to count our steps back. If only Panama were not that far away! A train! Quick, come on! Come on! Your hand! You have to run faster, Bear, not slower! I try, yes! Think of Panama! I do, I do! - Out of the way! Make room! - Who are you? I'm the one who has the rope. Hold on! Pull! Vamos! Grab me please! Pull! Hold on, little Bear! We save you! That was close! We were lucky. How are you? Is everything alright? Say something! You saved my life, sir. Oh, you're welcome. I had nothing better to do. Ah, perdon, I have to stir my tea water. Come sit with me. So, so, you're on your way to the land of your dreams! - Oh yes! - Our new home! Veramente? Was there something wrong with the old homeland? Well, not directly. But because this country is there, where everything is much nicer and bigger ... ... we thought we would rather live there. Moreover it smells, from top to bottom, like bananas. Capiche! Bananas would make you happy, they say. Do you know where this train is going? I have no idea. - I don't really care. - Why not? You know, guys, I know the whole world. From Rimini to Wolfenbüttel. But what I'm looking for, you won't find on a map. Oh yeah? And what is that, if I may ask? Amore! Amore! Amore! Amore! I think he means Love. And? Did you find it? No. But you should never give up hope. An old hand once said: "Without dreams, life is as boring as 7 suitcases of white bread." What are you doing over there? I continue to travel by ship. What ship? It's been a pleasure to become acquainted. Good luck, boys. Adios amigos! What are you thinking now, Tiger? Ah ... Just about our sofa. How good, if you have a friend, who even guides you into the wide world, right? Do you hear that? - No, what? - Well, the train! It stopped. Maybe we're already there! I don't know, Bear, I imagined it differently. Look, over there! Now I understand. You smell that? Mushrooms! There are even more! And there! And there! Come on! I think we have enough now. This is enough for at least a week. Tiger? As I see it, we have a problem. What do you suggest? - That way. - Why that way? Well, we have to go somewhere. Who says that's the right way? No one. Then I'll stay here. "Somewhere" is just too vague for me. Well alright. This does not mean that I agree with your decision. Ok. I see nothing, Tiger. Just follow me. And what if we walk in circles all the time? Well, somewhere we will come out again. You always with you "somewhere". Man, man ... What do you think, would it carry us? It seems we have no choice. Best if I go first. Don't look down! You hear? Normally, such bridges always collapse! Don't worry! If there was something wrong with the bridge, there would have been a sign at the front side. You see? Now we are almost there. That was not that bad! Was it? I'm here! Down here! Oh, you thick egg! Here! Here! You can't let go of me, you hear? No, I promise. On my honor! You're hopefully really as strong as a bear! - What do you think? - Do not let go! Our pot! I'm sliding! Noooooo! Oh dear! Oh dear, oh dear! Tiger! Tiger! Tiger! Hey, you over there! Calm down! You are scaring away the fish with your screaming. Did you happen to see my friend swim by? Your friend? I do not know. Lots of things swim past here all day. What does he look like then? - Oh, yeah, well, he's ... - As big as you? Yes, exactly. A little slimmer? Well, oh ... - With stripes. - Yes Yes! That's him. That's him! No, I'm sorry. I didn't come across him. What? But you said, with stripes and slimmer ... Tiger? Tiger! Bear! That was about time! I thought something had happened to you! With me? You fell off the bridge, right? Although you would hold me. - Well ... - Oh, forget about it. Rather tell me, what do you think of our new ship! Our ship? - But that is not our ... - And if! Haha! You can now call me Captain. And then you are First Chief Petty Officer. May I say, that the largest ship that we've ever driven, had paddles? Don't worry. With us tigers, shipping is in our blood! Hold on. Try this first. Engines off! Hoist sail! Aye, Aye Captain Sir! Caution! Good Lord! Oh! I had no idea how big the world is! Captain. Our ship has no name yet, Captain. You're right. We simply call it "Panama". Like this! Ready! Already done. Oh! Oh nee! Ha! That one also has stripes! This must be a sign. Who knows! Pa-na-ma. And then he just fell into the water. Hey! Is someone there? I'm here! Here! I knew it! I knew it! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Did I not say that we would meet again someday? - Did I not tell you? - I don't understand. You don't want to claim that you don't remember me? It's me! Do you know eachother? I know, those stripes, I didn't have them then. When you took me out of the water. - It's me. It's me! - But that ... But that's not possible! Can't you see? Now I can finally thank you, for giving me my freedom. Yes, so ... The way it looks here, you 2 could certainly use some help, right? So, what will it be? Deal? Well, what we have now caught ... Best, you take care of him. I still have do a little radio. Aye, Aye Captain Sir! Here's Delta Cabrio Tango! Do you read? Delta Cabrio Tango! Here Foxtrot Alpha, please speak after the beep. Course will change at 30 degrees in the shade. Roger, Foxtrot. Course gauged. Over. - Tiger. Tiger! - What? Look out the window! That too! What should we do now? We can no longer see where we are heading! Do not worry, guys! If you have a fish on board, it will take you to any place. Now I happen to know the 7 oceans like my back pocket. If I would have one. I do not understand. If you no longer see anything above water, you have to orient yourself under water. Is there a long rope here somewhere? Here we go! Look, Bear! The sail! You need to douse the sail! Sail is doused, Captain Sir! Alarm! S.O.S.! Mayday! You gotta help me, Bear! I can't hold the boat, Bear! I can't even hold myself! Oh, my goodness! Help! Help!! Help!!! Help ... Hey, get me out of here! I said, I want out of here! Why are you yelling like this? Because I'm in a pot, which is not a good place for a fish! That's our pot. Tiger! Tiger! Did you hear that? It came from down there! It's beautiful here! Look, fish! If only Bear could see! Wait a second! It smells like ... - Tiger! - I'm coming! Bananas! Everywhere Bananas! - Tiger! - Bear! Bear! Bear! It is completely packed with bananas here! Bananas! Bananas! So many bananas! This is the best day of our lives, right? Oh yes, Tiger! The best day ever! Then you search in vain, all over the world, for the land of your dreams and you are eventually blown there by a storm! - A rare coincidence, right? - Coincidence does't exist, Tiger. Just call it luck then. Maybe now we're always lucky. Sure. Now we just have to build our new home. Material we have enough. That's beautiful. Just as we had always imagined. Right, Bear? Voila! Varied banana dish, à la Panama! Enjoy your meal, Mr. Tiger. Bananas à la ... à la ... All kinds. Hey, Bear? Yes? Don't you feel like mushrooms again? Smothered in butter. With parsley potatoes and salt! Until later, Bear! And turn on the oven. I'll be back soon! A house! Neighbors! Bear!? Is it you? Who else? Yes, but those are my footsteps! I walked in a circle, Bear! Yes, don't you know what that means? We are not in Panama, but are stranded on a desert island! Somewhere in Nowhere! Oh, Tiger! We cannot possibly stay here. Don't worry. I bet in a few days, a white ship will come and take us. Hey! And if no white ship passes by? ♪ Nanana! A ship, a ship! ♪ Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here! Nanana! I'll keep the next watch. That's... You call this "to keep watch"? But you can't just fall asleep here! - What ... I was not asleep! - Liar! What did you say? You take that back right away. - I won't even think about it! - O yes, you will think about it! Ha! Then you can wait a long time! But then we have also enough time here! What do you mean by that? Well, now who wanted so badly to go to the land that smells like bananas from top to bottom? So, that's ... Shall I tell you something? I can no longer see those things! Do you think I can? Take it easy! You are friends, aren't you? You keep out of it! I can do without a friend like you! You, Bear? Tiger! - May I ask you something? - Yes. Well, what I wanted to know is: About how long does such a quarrel last? No idea. What do you think? Do you think we can at least interrupt it? - At least for tonight? - Yes, I think that's good. As far as I'm concerned, we can just forget about it. Yes that's OK. From up there, we have a much better view. Come on! What are you waiting for? I'd rather stay down here. Well, come on! 4 eyes see more than 2. Heaven, that's high! Heaven, that's deep! But I still don't see a ship. Do you want to have a look? Where are you? I told you this was not a good idea. One thing I tell you! If you want to eat us, you can experience something! My friend here is as strong as a bear! What makes you think, I want to eat you? After all, I just saved his life. He's right about that. I was there myself. So you need not be afraid, little Tiger. How do you know my name? Oh, it was just a suspicion. But apart from that, I know a lot about you. Really? Well, let's say: At least I know that you are looking for the land of your dreams. Although, only the finding is not yet successful. Here, it is certainly not. Where there are no mushrooms, no river and no fields, cannot be Panama. Panama! I understand. So there you wanted to go! Yes. Do you know the Way? Me? What a question! Of course I know the way. - I know all the roads. - Did you hear that? - Maybe he can take us! - Yes. Yes, yes. Take us? - Do I have to climb on top of him? - Yes. Never. I'd rather stay here forever and ever. Well, as you wish. Bye! Bye! Is that not beautiful?! Lots of things swim past here. Tiger! Hello! Hello! My goodness, Tiger! Have you ever seen anything more beautiful in your life? That down there must be Panama, Tiger! That beautiful can only be Panama! You think so? Hold on, back there! We land! Look, Tiger! A house! With chimney! What is that? Pa ... Pa-na-ma! Panama! It reads Panama, Tiger! - Panama! - Yes, you were right, Bear! This is how we have always imagined it. Right, Tiger? Exactly so! Do you think someone lives there? It seems so deserted. Come on, let's have a look. Nobody there. You, Bear? You know what I believe? I assume the same what I believe. - But that's not possible at all ... - Come along! That's not possible! This must be a dream! No, Tiger, this is not a dream. This is our garden. Our vegetable garden, our raspberry bush! - Bye, bird! - Bye! Easy down there! My dear, good, highly appreciated friend and Bear! Hello! Is someone there? I'm here! I have a letter here. An express letter! Express letter? A new service of post hare Rudi, rapid delivery courier service. Sent today, delivered today. Here you are! Let me guess. You've finally bought a bike. No, but I am recently a couple, to speak. May I introduce? My new best friend. Day! Don't we know each other? You brought us along back then. However, you had only just disappeared behind the hill, when I met my friend Rudi. Just walked past me. I have to thank you. You're welcome. Such a friend you don't find on every corner, you know? Stop! Long legs for the pedals. And he has a name too! What else do you want? Everybody sit up straight! Duty calls. Bye. To hold! From Tiger. My dear, good, much appreciated friend and Bear. I'm fine. How are you doing? Peel the onions in the meantime, because today there are ... Mushrooms! Bear? Where are you? You are already cooking? Why didn't you wait for me? For what? I wrote you a letter that today mushrooms ... Huh? Do not worry, you'll get your mushrooms. Because while we traveled through the big wide world, they popped up everywhere in our garden. Would you prefer the mushrooms stewed in butter with chives, cut on an egg, Mr. Tiger, or rather in a stew? Stew? What's a stew? Everything together. Oh yes! And for dessert I want Schlabber pudding with raspberry milk and Zimtstreuseln. OK? You know what, Bear? I believe we have never had it as good as now. What you say, Tiger. Bear, look! My little Tiger-duck. I think she thinks something. Yes, every time she looks like she looks now, she thinks something. And she has been looking like this since yesterday. Really? I think she's a little upset, because her wheels hurt from the long journey. But sometimes there must be long trips. - You, Bear? - What, Tiger? In fact, I was right about my suspicion. Yes. What suspicion? That behind that hill lies the land of our dreams. Behind that hill? We actually just looked on the wrong side. Yes. Because if we had not gone into the wide world, we would never have learned what a tandem is. And we hadn't come across the donkey on the train either. Or the fish and the bird of paradise. And we would never have discovered, where the country of our dreams really is. Namely here. ♪ Oh, how beautiful Panama is ♪ Where all dreams come true ♪ Panama is beautiful ♪ Whilst I've never been there ♪ We travel to Panama today ♪ Where all dreams come true ♪ Panama is beautiful ♪ Whilst I've never been there ♪ With a friend by your side ♪ And we have a lot of courage ♪ Let's go on a journey ♪ Because we are doing so well ♪ On the happiness in the distance ♪ Yes, we rejoice so much ♪ 1 time South and 2 times East ♪ And we are already at sea ♪ We travel to Panama today ♪ Where all dreams come true ♪ Panama is beautiful ♪ Whilst I've never been there ♪ Oh, how beautiful Panama is ♪ Where all dreams come true ♪ Panama is beautiful ♪ Whilst I've never been there ♪ Tiger-duck, sunglasses ♪ The fishing rod will also comes along ♪ Tennis rackets, raincoat ♪ And also many other things ♪ Where are you going?
