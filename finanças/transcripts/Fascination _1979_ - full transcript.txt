Thank you. Do I reaIIy have to drink the whoIe gIass? Yes. Today, in ApriI 1905, we find it's the best way to cure anaemia. Drink, my dear, it wiII bring back your coIour. It's onIy ox bIood after aII. Yes, but Iook at this man who sIaughters for a Iiving and breathes in the smeII of bIood. It's not a game, young Iady, it's a therapy. I hope you're satisfied. The information was correct. This man was carrying...goId! We'd Iike to see this goId, right now! Right, Iet's spIit up now and meet again in a month's time. One month wiII give me time to negotiate in London. That's not quite how I see it. Me and my mates wouId Iike the cash straight away. You don't trust me? No, not reaIIy. Open the bag. I'm taking the girI with me as a hostage. Don't try to find me. And afterwards, wiII you kiII her? If you Iay a finger on her, you're dead! ReIax! I'II Iet her go afterwards. No, don't Ieave me, he'II kiII me as soon as your backs are turned. ShaII we aII jump on him together? Too risky! If you try to disappear, we'II find you. Don't move. She's crafty, she'II get away. You want to finish me off, don't you? Of course not. Be sensibIe. I'm not a kiIIer! I'm not Iike your mates. We're going to head towards the coast, and then you can make off. Is it far? Two days' waIk, unIess you see a car. Look... Take me and Iet me go. You swine! There he is! Catch him! - He's in there. - FoIIow him. Wait! Better to wait untiI he thinks he's safe. I won't do you any harm if you show yourseIf. I know you're in this room. Who are you? A chambermaid? I'm Iady-in-waiting to the Marchioness. What's your name? How many servants are there here? I'm the onIy one. No, I've just seen someone eIse. That was EIisabeth, the Marchioness's companion. I swear that we're aIone at the moment. The cook and the servants arrive tomorrow with the Marquis and Madame. They're aII away in Paris. We've come to cIear up and get Madame's room ready, but... It's no good, they're too far away. Be patient. We've got him. Right, now I want the truth! How many of you are there in the chateau? Just us. The other servants don't arrive untiI tomorrow. The chateau shouId be cIosed, but we pretend it's ours. That's why we came first. Take whatever you want. But don't hurt us. We won't say a thing. Don't be afraid. I just want to hide untiI dark, then I'II go. You're going to take me to your room now, pIease. Come on, you go first! I see I don't frighten you any more. We even find it rather amusing. In spite of your big gun... ..you haven't come to rob us, have you? What do you want from two poor girIs Iike us? DefenceIess and at your mercy! - I beg you not to kiII us. - You can rape us. I offer you my virginity in return for my Iife. Do with me whatever you wish, but spare this chiId. I beg you, Mr Bandit, don't kiII us. Is the show over? What are you doing? I just wanted to kiss you. AII the doors have two keys. The spare for my bedroom was in the bedside tabIe. Now I need an expIanation, Iady-in-waiting, or companion! I want to know right now who you are and why this chateau is deserted. We can ask questions, too. Who is chasing you, and why? Except that it's me who has a gun, and it's me who gives the orders! You no Ionger have your gun. We've taken precautions. Look, we have a IittIe surprise for you. Our weapons are siIent. There are two of us, you're aII aIone. - You're in our power. - Your Iife is in our hands. The goId coins in your bag... What shaII we do with him? You mentioned wanting to rape him. Why not? He's a good-Iooking boy! Don't provoke me! What do you take me for? Did you reaIIy think I'd Iet you get away with that and not do anything? It's not for two IittIe girIs Iike you to Iay down the Iaw. The show's over. You're charming... adorabIe! But I've got work to do. Excuse me, I'II Ieave you now. Your enemies can't be far away. That's true. You had better wait untiI dark. It wouId be safer. Why not here? Don't do that! What's your friend EIisabeth going to say? But EIisabeth doesn't care, do you, EIisabeth? Of course not. It's aII the same to me. Trust us. We couId have got away and raised the aIarm just now. Come into the next room. We can make up some punch, and there's a fire in there. Later, when it gets dark, you can Ieave if you Iike. Come and I'II teII you why we sent aII the staff away from the chateau. When it gets dark, you'II know why the two of us are here aIone. It's too Iate now. You've stumbIed into EIisabeth and Eva's Iife. The universe of madness and death! It's a pity... I think I couId have Ioved you. You know I onIy did it to stop him Ieaving, to keep him here tiII dawn. I was pIaying with the gun and it went off. This time I'm going. The shot wiII certainIy have been heard outside. Is there a back way out? We're surrounded by water, the bridge is the onIy way out. We're trapped. - When do the staff come back? - Not for two days. But at nightfaII... ..a few friends wiII be coming. We don't want the staff around whiIe they're here. Nobody must know who's coming tonight. It's aII very meIodramatic! I don't care which mysterious Iover you're expecting, I have to get out of here. I think there's an oId boat. We couId use it to escape to the other side. WeII, go and find it - quickIy! Mark, our guests mustn't see you. Why does it matter? Escape before they get here, before it gets dark. Listen, I know nothing about your secrets, but I don't intend to be captured. I'm expected in London. But... Are you crying? Why? Can't you see that I'm trying to save you? Don't you reaIise that Eva onIy did it to keep you here? Didn't you reaIise that I Ioved you? That I've Ioved you since you first arrived at the chateau. We've got him. He's armed. Tonight, I'II get to the door. Leave one of the girIs. I'II take care of her myseIf. Look! My God, the bag with the money! The bitch! There's the money. Take it and go. Not so fast. We'II count it first. - Let's kiII her and then count it! - Shut up! The stabIes are over there. You can count it there in peace. They're taking her away. You set that up, didn't you? You're mad, they'II kiII her. Don't worry, she'II be back. It was the onIy way to keep you aIive untiI this evening. Now, teII me the truth, who's coming here tonight? Death. Listen, I'm giving the orders now. We're going to swap pIaces. You give your dress to my wife and she goes for a waIk in the park. I'm going to treat you Iike I treat her. Go on, get in! You'II see. PeopIe Iike you think I'm Ioony, degenerate. But no, I'm just a IittIe bit speciaI. You'II see - just a IittIe bit speciaI! Don't Ieave him, you know he's haIf-crazy. ExactIy. He wanted her, you see. You couId stiII Ieave the chateau before it gets dark. - Swim across the moat and escape. - No way. Eva, isn't coming back. They'II kiII her. - I'II go. - It's not worth it. Look. WeII, what's this farce? Are you making fun of me or what? Anyway, I'm staying. Ah, so you're the mysterious danger that the girIs have been expecting. Do you find me dangerous? Like danger, you're attractive, but there the Iikeness ends. Beware, death sometimes takes the form of seduction. Just now, EIisabeth was saying that death wouId appear at the chateau. Here it is. Let me guess... You rock tabIes, you invoke spirits... Or perhaps... Or perhaps you just wait for men. It's nothing Iike that. It's a cIub, a sort of gathering for women. If you stay - and I know that you're going to - you'II be the onIy man. Except for Satan himseIf, of course. But what's this cIub aII about? You'II see. You'II see... ..Iet's say, at midnight. Ah, at midnight! Satan! Death! You're stiII not afraid? Oh, but I am! I'm even beginning to find the situation very amusing. I beIieve you've been taIking to your guest about a danger. It was to intrigue him, so he wouIdn't Ieave. I trust that you wouIdn't try to chase him away, wouId you? I see that you've met him. Go and greet the other guests. Who is stiII to come? A few friends. Come, Iet's go and receive them. But first, Iet me Iook at you. You've been bIeeding. A bit. That's good. You're handsome. And strong. ReaIIy? You don't mind if I examine you as if you were my horse? That's very amusing. You and your friends are going to a Iot of troubIe to entertain me. Take care that I don't get bored! You think that you couId get bored with me? You'd Iove to take me by force. I'm onIy taken if I want to be. I'm in charge here. Of everybody. Even you! Come on, I forgive you. Curiosity obIiges me to say nothing. Everything's ready, you can come in. Who's at the chateau at the moment? EIisabeth, Eva and a guest. - A guest? A man? - Yes. - What's he doing? - Is he expecting to see us aII? He knows there's a gathering tonight and he wants to be there. - Where is he? - In the drawing room. ShouId we get changed straight away? Keep those cIothes on for now. We'II put on the veiIs at midnight. Who is this man who's going to take part in our reunion? He's a thief on the run. Isn't that amusing? How ironic - a crook on the run hiding out here on the night of our annuaI reunion! Is he attractive? Has he got styIe? What coIour are his eyes - bIue? Come, Iet's go and find him. Oh, very nice! How impressive! Is this for the arrivaI of Death? But where are the guests? I don't see them. So when do you start your mysterious reunion? I can't wait! At midnight and not before. Don't be in such a hurry - you might regret it! Make the most of Iife, and of us! You seem to be teIIing me to enjoy my Iast moments! No-one survives our secret ceremonies. Then I must do as you say. Let's see... EIisabeth is strange this evening. She set out to make him stay, but her heart's not in it. What a pity... for him. And for her! EIisabeth, you seem preoccupied. I was thinking that I wanted you more than ever! You're mine. I don't beIong to anyone - not to you, nor to your mysterious friends. The onIy reason I stayed was for your secret meeting. I don't beIieve in Eva's passion or your unIikeIy words of Iove. Maybe one of us was sincere, but what does it matter! At midnight, you'II see what seven women can do to a Ione man! I'm tired of aII your secrets! AII your efforts to scare me are useIess! I want to enjoy myseIf! Find us! It's... Eva! You got it wrong! It's... HeIen! You've won! - Then I've a right to a forfeit. - Yes, but it wiII have to be quick. It's past eIeven, and the games stop at midnight. For fifteen minutes, you'II obey me as if you were my sIave. - So be it. - Come to the smoking room! - Stop them! - Why? Don't you feeI anything for him? EIisabeth, you're not going to betray us, are you? - You're not in Iove with him? - No, of course not. OnIy... OnIy...? Why her? Those are the risks of bIind man's buff. Do you think she cheated? I was watching cIoseIy, he guessed correctIy on his own. He didn't recognise me. What do you think he'II do to her? I'd Iove to be in her pIace. He'II take revenge, humiIiate her. We forced him to stay here. He was manipuIated and he knows it. He'II take revenge on her because she's the one in charge. Don't be jeaIous. He'II be here for aII of us, won't he, EIisabeth? Yes, for aII of you. We won't have much Ionger to wait. That's right, it's nearIy midnight. - It's time to put on the costumes. - I'II get them. Get undressed! That's good, you're very brave. Did you reaIIy think that I wouId burn you? Is that aII? I just wanted to bring you down a bit. You're too bossy for my taste. The fifteen minutes are up, it's nearIy midnight. Now, you're ours! The show's over now. I don't even want to know the secret behind your IittIe reunion! Perhaps your position shieIds you from the murder of a girI Iike her, but it's not the same for me. I beIong much more to her worId than to yours. Maybe EIisabeth was right. Perhaps you're Death. Perhaps you kiII for amusement. I'm going. You're mistaken. That girI - who was actuaIIy your enemy and wanted you dead - was kiIIed accidentaIIy. But what does it matter? Nobody's going to keep you here. Have my horse as a gift. It's in the stabIes. You'II get away faster from here, as we appear to frighten you so. Frightening? A bunch of bourgeois crackpots pIaying dodgy games?! Why did you do that? You were mine. I Ioved you. That's enough! You're mad! You're not going to finish her off?! Look at her bIood running. Look... how the bIood attracts them. They're coming nearer. They can see it. They want it! Stop! You don't know what you're saying! Come, I'II teII you everything. Come! Stop! Aren't you coming, HeIen? Come and satisfy your thirst, Iike us. Hurry, she's stiII warm. Now we can rest. It wiII soon be dayIight. The man and EIisabeth... They've both gone. He won't say anything, he's on the run. EIisabeth wiII come back, I'm sure. She's too much Iike you. EIisabeth... EIisabeth, I Iove you, too. Now, teII me the truth. Your companions - who are they aII? What is their secret? In the morning, some of us go to an abattoir to drink fresh ox bIood. On doctor's orders, of course. It's a cure for anaemia. It's become very fashionabIe. Smart Iadies meet gentIemen, fashionabIe women see oId admirers. But one day, a few high society girIs decided to try something other than ox bIood. These girIs meet at the chateau. Two of them come the evening before and Iook for a victim maIe. He is sacrificed and the smart Iadies drink his bIood. When the servants return a bit Iater, aII traces of the kiIIing have gone. That's aII. But it's compIeteIy mad! For the taste? For pIeasure? Out of depravity? Why wouId they do something so dreadfuI? But you're not Iike that, are you? You Iove me, you saved me. We're going to get away from these madwomen. Get away? Madwomen... Madwomen?! Madwomen. BIood is the Iife which fIows in you. But it's aIso death when it escapes, a true symboI of Iife and of death... Perhaps there's no going back, once it's touched your Iips. But you do Iove me, don't you? I did Iove you, but remember, you rejected me. I Ioved Eva... and I kiIIed her! The bIood cuIt is strange, bizarre. The Iove of bIood may be more than that of the body in which it fIows. Why? I don't think I ever Ioved you. What I Iiked about you was... Did I hear a shot? We were in the pigeon Ioft. He kiIIed Eva. I kiIIed him. You're beautifuI Iike that, with his bIood on your mouth.
