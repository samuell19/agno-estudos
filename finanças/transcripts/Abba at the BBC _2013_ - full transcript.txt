'Do you get much time to sightsee 'And look around the places you're touring?' No, unfortunately not. We were just talking about that. It's more or less just travelling and sleeping and working, you know. We've got time for one more. Line six. 'Hello?' - Hi, who's this? - 'Janice English.' Hello, Janice. Right, what's your question, quickly? 'I'd like to ask Benny how they know 'who will choose the lead vocal on new single or album tracks.' Oh, we talk about that, you know. When we have a new song, we say, "Well, let's listen to it," and the girls come in and they say, "Well, I'd like to do that," and if they both want to sing it, they both sing it, and if Agnetha wants to sing it, she sings it. It's not very complicated. It's just... - You just have a good argument. - Yes. Thank you very much indeed. I'm sorry to rush you there, but unfortunately, time, as always, is the enemy, and it beats us. Just as we seem to have problems with time, you do as well. Thank you so much for coming along. You've got a very nasty schedule. Pass on our very best wishes to the ladies. - It was great shame we couldn't meet them. - I will.

Well, they're obviously relieved to hear it! I was just going to ask you if that ever occurred to you, and who would make the decision? Would it be a joint decision? It would, yeah. We would decide that together. It would be more of a feeling, I think, because when we were recording an album, we would feel that it's not fun any more. We haven't got anything more to give, and that would be the time to split, you know. - We should have done that a long time ago! - I know! In what way would you say you've changed since those early clays of the Eurovision Song Contest? I am alarmingly ageing! Some of the journalists in the English press say that. - Say you're alarmingly ageing? - Am I really? Do you mean musically...? No, as people. As people, do you feel that...? - Has it been a strain in any way? - We are older and wiser, hopefully. - Are you a lot wiser? - Yes, I am. - No, she's not. - It's not only a sexy bottom, you know. - Ooh!
