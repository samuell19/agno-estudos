Not so long ago, I started to think, how every man and every animal suddenly dies, including Dad, Mom, Jore, and myself. - Sam. Sam. Do you want to come? - I think it's broken. - Really? Here? I'm sorry ... - Should I call the doctor or Mom? - No no. Mother will suffice ... - I blame you for this. - It's nobody's fault ... - He dug such a hole ... - You should keep your eyes open ... - Enough. We must go to the doctor. It's unbelievable I start my vacation this way, and this is just the beginning. - Dad, you see? Fish! - Now is not the time ... Sorry, sorry ... "THINK NOW of THE FUTURE" Do you think when the last dinosaur died out, he knew that he was the last one? - Sam, do you mind waiting outside? - Ma'am. Ma'am. - What do you want, you tiny tourist? - My brother is going to kill me, will he no longer be able to stand up? - Typical male problem ... Kill you? Your brother will be on his feet quickly, don't worry. - May I have a portion of fish, plus chutney added. Did you know that for nine days cockroaches can live without their heads? - I did not know ... - Nine days after starving. - No, I did not know. Here you go. - Hello. - Hi. - Do you speak German? - What? - Do you speak German? - No, I'm Dutch. - Have you ever heard about the zebrafish? - zebrafish? I know that the herring can communicate by farting. - And this has what to do with the zebrafish? - Do you play the trumpet? - No, I play the computer. - Forget it ... You can go. Wait, wait! Can you salsa dance? - I can't. - Perfect. We can learn it together. Tess. - Sam. So I met Tess. You could say that I took the initiative, but I think she did much more. My darlings, who have already started with the basics. Now, go to the dance. The key is to find yourself next to a guy, right? - I will lead. - But I'm a man. Now, we dance. Magnificent! - Hey, you salsa king. - Hi Dad. - We have to take your brother to the island, to rest the leg. - Sam can't stay here? - No. - I have until tonight to learn salsa. At the hospital, you were just waiting anyway. - Would you like to stay? - My mother works in a hospital, he will be in safe hands. - Dad. - I'm coming. You will find your way back to the beach house, right? - Yes. - See you later. - What are we doing now? - Buying flowers. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye? - You two are going to town? Say hi to your mother on the way. - All right. That was Hille. According to my mother he has an obsessive personality disorder. - What's that? - Typical male problem. He goes to the hospital for every little thing, just to see my mother. - And your dad? - My father is dead. During a volcanic eruption. Before I came into the world, he died. Magnificent Bed & breakfast, Hello, this is Tess. Bye. - It was nice to hang out with you. - We aren't buying flowers? - Where the hell is? You are still here? I have to welcome the guests. - Can I go too? - All right, let's go. We're here. Pull! Bring a pillow. Congratulations for winning! I'm Tess, welcome to our little peace island. I hope that you enjoy yourselves here, Our programs included picnics and an exciting treasure hunt ... - Sweetheart, feel free to talk Dutch. - Yes, we speak Dutch. I talked with you on the phone? - Magnificent Bed & Breakfast, Hello, this is Tess. - I thought you were much older. - Can I look at the prize coupon? - Sure. At first I thought it was a joke. - Joke? - Yeah, I've never won anything. I'm Elise. - I ... Tess. - Sam. - Hey Sam. - Hugo. - Sam. - Hugo. - Bye! - Welcome to the island. - Actually, I don't want to do this, I don't want to this at all. But I have to. - Why do you have to? - I just do, move on. - To be kind and greet the guests? - Of course. It's obvious, too. - So that's why you were so weird. - Weird? Do you think I'm weird? - Yes, a little. - Do you think they thought that about me? I.. I want to be alone for a while. - Tess! I thought she would come back, but she didn't. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Hi Mom. - Finally, you're back. You caught a bit of the day. - Your migraine has passed? Jore fell into a pit. - I heard. Your father called. It wasn't your fault. We'll take the ferry tomorrow. Dad says you acquired a new friend. Did you have a good time? What did you do? I don't know why Tess left me. How could she just leave? I am the youngest in the family. And so everyone will die before me. I have to practice being alone. - Hey, little crab. ALONENESS TRAINING - Solitude training. THIS WEEK day | hours spent alone If I practice a lot, I won't be afraid to be alone. Monday: 2 hours Tuesday: 4 hours Wednesday: 6 hours Thursday: 8 hours - You see them? - Not yet. There they are! Dad, Jore! - Damn vacation. - Come on ... - Isn't that right? No football, no bikes, no swimming ... I'll be bored to death. - You want me to draw a dinosuar on your cast? - No, I'll kill you. - Don't say that. - Do you know what you can do? Eat food. - Great idea. - There is a fish vendor close to the hospital, isn't there? - Don't you want muffins? - Don't be a baby. - How? I thought he liked fish. - Of course he likes the fish. - Who's next? What can I get you? - Four pieces, please. - Four pieces, it is. Hi, Dr. Cockroach ... - Dr. Cockroach? - Large or small pieces? - Large. All right, make it big. - And add chutney to it. - Simple, add chutney. - What happened to your leg? - From a soccer kick. - Sad ... - Here, hold this so I can pay. - Hey, isn't that the girl? Let's go. - No, I don't feel like it. Don't ... - Hi. I'm still alive. Thank you for taking care of him. - Dad, I'm not a baby. - My favorite tiny tourist. - Hey. It's pretty serious between those two, isn't it? - No? - Yes, the weather's great for a good picnic. - Picnic? - Mom, what are you saying? - Oh, I did not know that it was a surprise. - Yeah. Surprise. - Nice. - Going on a date with your girl? - We're going on a picnic. - Wow, how did you manage. Can you teach me? - Are you coming? - Use it until Wednesday. Is that good? Or Thursday? Or Friday? How about Saturday? - Saturday sounds good. Say hi to your mother for me. - I will. - Bye. - Bye. - On this island it's best to have your own bike. - I never told you I'm sorry. - Why not? - My mom says women apologize too much. Yeah, so I'm sorry. I never say that. - Or you can sometimes say, "I didn't mean to do that." Or, "You don't deserve to be left alone in the desert." - Those are more complicated than "I'm sorry." Hugo is close, should we visit them? - What? - Wait, wait! - Do you feel like a picnic with us? - We were just going to the beach. - Good idea. I know the beach is the best place for picnics. - What do you think? - We prefer the beach alone. - Yes, sorry. - What was that about? - Nothing. - It was something. - It was nothing. - Do you think the last dinosaur was sad when he died? - Of course he was sad to see the others die. On the other hand, maybe not so much. He was the only one who died in solitude. - Yes exactly. Anyway, I have "solitude training." - Solitude what?? - I am very young, I must prepare for the case if I am left alone on the earth. - And you think I'm weird? - Tomorrow 4 hours I have to practice being alone. - And while you practice, you can't sleep? Or you cann't go to the toilet? - No big deal. It's just hard to find time for the exercises. - Don't drink that! - What the hell? Wine? Why did you bring wine? The picnic wasn't really for me? - Well, can I sing? - Yes, you can. - I'm good-looking? - Fortunately. - I'm old? - No. - Hey! You little lover boy. - How was your picnic? - You guys kissed? - Gross. - Since everyone is here, We had a good idea. Jore unfortunately broke his leg, but did not want to sit here all day, so tomorrow We're going bowling. How am I going to bowl in a wheelchair? - I will help you. - I can't go. - Why can't you? - I don't believe it. - I told you, to see Tess. - Call her too. - Yes, it will be fun. - Tess hates bowling. - Forget that girl. - Right? Join us. - Yes, just cancel and come with us ... - I promised her. - We'll do something nice together another time. - But we'll still go? - Yes of course. Wait, now I know who I am. Handsome singer ... ?? ?? No? Then who? - No, it's not worth it. - Justin Bieber. - Have fun. Bye. - Bye, kid. It was one of those difficult moments, but I must hold myself to the plan. - Five, four, three, two, one. Tess, what's she doing here? Of course, she crushes on Jore. Three years older than me, and much taller than I am. - Hey, Sam. - You found them? - What? - Your binoculars. - Binoculars? Come with me. Come on. - Don't get lost in the desert, ok? - What did you tell my parents? - Don't worry. They don't know you're roaming the island, to practice feeling alone. Why do you say that I don't like bowling? I like it very much. - Anyway, what are you here for? - I came looking for you. I came up with a good game. You will like it. There will be two teams, Elise and you will be one of the teams, I and Hugo will be the other ... Suddenly I understood why Tess was acting so weird. She was in love with someone else. - It's hilarious, isn't it? - I'm not stupid. Forget it. For your information, he's too old for you, and he has a girlfriend. - What? I know why you invented the whole thing. - Sam, I need you. - I'm not your servant. Why don't you just go to Hugo? - Sam. Hugo is my father. - Tess! - Be careful, you little tourist. She went upstairs. You staying for dinner? - Um, yeah. Knock before you enter - So your Dad didn't die in a volcanic eruption? No, not swallowed up in the Amazon, nor devoured by sharks, If you didn't know anything about your father, it would trigger your imagination. Look. - Buenos Aires. - This is my mother's diary. Here she met my father and they traveled together throughout Argentina. "Here Hugo would stay forever?" - Yes, and see, because his last name doesn't appear my mother thought, I would not find him. BIKE RENTALS - Look. So you don't see anything special, but if you look closely ... - Hugo Faber. - Nine months later I was born. - Guys, dinner is served. - Wait, mother does not know they're on the island, so I have to keep it a secret. - Tastes good? - Darlings, I have to go somewhere in a little bit. - You're going on a date with Hille? - No, I have no intention of dating him. I'm going to prepare the guest house, tourists come on Saturday. - But that's still four days. - Yes, but it's empty now, so there's time to ventillate the musty smell. - We will do it. - Yes. - That's sweet, but I'll take care of it myself. - But I was wanting anyway to show Sam the bungalow. - Please ... - So be it. But you have to clean up the dishes. - Of course. - Wait. - Why did your mom not tell you, who your father is? - My mother always said, I do not need a father. So I thought that, but then I started to doubt What if I need him? In short, I found the name and began to search. - How long did it take to find him? - Ten minutes. - Ten minutes? - Yes, Facebook. - And then? - Then I found out about everything. He lives with his girlfriend in Berlin, loves to travel. Thus came the idea for a sweepstakes. - And the Salsa-ing. - Yeah, I forgot about that. Then I invited them here to the island. I sent him a letter saying, they won a five day vacation for free. - Why did you not tell Hugo right away? - What if he's a bad guy? I may not have wanted to. I don't want to screw up, you know? Once he knows the truth, I can't undo it. But I only have three days left. Tomorrow I need you. - Tomorrow's not good. I'm going to be training alone. Maybe it's better if you don't regard him as your father, Then you won't have to attend his funeral. So just regard him as Hugo, when he dies. - Are you serious? Sorry, Sam, but you're totally screwed up. Your aloneness training ... I promise to you at your funeral, I'll be there. As they say: crimes committed in love gain forgiveness. Solitude training is suspended for one day. - Hello, Hugo, Elise. Hugo! Elise! - Maybe they're not here. - The car is outside. - They are... - Gross! Good morning. - Hello. We have this treasure hunting game. - I'm not in the mood. - What kind of treasure hunt? - We have come to take you to Schnitzeliak! - Sorry, guys. In an hour should be fine? - Very. - Great. - Fantastic! - Good luck. - Well, let's start with a song title. What was saxophonist Charlie Parker's nickname? - Bird. - Right. - The males of what tropical fish cannot live together in an aquarium? - Tess. - Bette, also known as Siamese fighting fish. - You guessed it, very nice. - Music: In what country is the Goka Trumpet Festival held every year? - In Portugal. - Serbia! - They are right. - Let's see the challenge: Nearby there is a tree. - There. Next to it are two dry stumps and various tools. Both teams have 15 minutes to build something. This is the final task, which will decide which team is the winner of the day. - Everybody ready? - Prepare. Start! - What should we do? - Turtle. We saw it in half, and use bark for the head and legs. - Let's do it. Will it work? - Yes. - Hurry. What happened? Let me see. - It was an accident. - But what happened? Squeeze tightly. - Bind this. - Press it. Wrap it good and tight. That's very good. We need to find a doctor. - Tess, come on! - No. - We have to go see a doctor, come on, Tess. - My mother is on duty. - Hurry up. - You go. Give me your cellphone. - What? - Give me the phone. - Here. - Quickly run home . Run home now. - Sweetheart. - Hello, I'm Sam. - Who? - Your favorite small tourist. You must go home immediately. - But I'm working, what happened? - Tess had an accident. - What happened? - A very bad thing. - Let me talk to Tess. - She can't. - Sam, tell me now, what's this all about? - Tess ... pregnant. She locked herself in the bathroom and will not say a word. Hello? - You, come with me. Hurry up. - Here? - Exactly. - Hello? - She's not here, she suddenly had to go. - Ready ma'am? - Examine him. - Yes, of course. Come. Please. - Thank you very much. - Doctor. - Yes? - He'll live? - Of course, don't worry. - Hey. - She did not come to work. - And he doesn't ... - Now is not the time. - Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? You look very familiar. He is the one who eats here, and then vanishes all day. What's his name? I got it. My son. Already I don't know him. - And Mom? - Has a migraine. - We should eat something, no? - So go buy some fries? Fries, okay? For your plaster friend, no hot dogs or cookies or things like that, okay? - Ok. - Let me go, if you touch me, I will castrate. - Sorry. - Damn holiday, damn plaster, damn, damn ... - There must be something you don't hate. - Um ... Kissing? What? You haven't kissed her yet? - No. - Man, you need to take command. A girl wants you to be clear. You didn't know that? - Who's next? - We are. - What can I get you? - Three fries. And cheese croquettes, chicken morsels. - Anything else? - What do you want? - A Mexican dish. - that will be EUR 16.40. - Here you go. - Thank you. - 3.60 in change. - Thank you. - Next. - Not a word to anyone. - Hey, Dr. Cockroach. Hello. Have you had a nice day? - It was fine. - Tomorrow, are you coming to the fair? - Fair? - I'll have a booth, all kinds of food. - Sounds fun, doesn't it? - Yes, maybe I'll check on you. - Will you have this chair long? - Three more nights. - Well then, have fun! - Then maybe tomorrow. - Yes, maybe tomorrow. - "A boy has to take command, The girl wants you to be clear." - Dude, shut up. - You're in love, right? - Not true. - Jore is in love, Jore is in love I forgot to apologize to you for your leg falling into the pit. - Forget it. - Guys, look what I found. - Oh no. - Dad, come on. Dad, stop already. Dad, enough. Imagine that I never knew my Dad, like Tess. If I see him now like for the first time. What would it feel like? - Dad! - A little quieter, okay? You are driving me crazy. - Maybe tomorrow will be better, and then the four of us go have some fun. - But ... - No buts, you're coming with us. I mastered aloneness training. The most important thing was was to go with Tess. I wonder if she's okay. - How are you? - Well, I'm not pregnant. - Here. - Hugo came with Elise. They're not angry. I'm going to tell him. - Have you thought it out? - Yes, but you have to accompany. - How much does it cost? - Come. - Look, we could dance to this. - Hi, it's me. - Hey, Sam, sit down. - Come. - Have a cookie. - You see, Sam? - Yeah, look, it's all bandanged up, it's good, isn't it? - Having fun? We're leaving tomorrow. What do you guys want? - I'd like grape juice. - And you? - Nothing, thanks. - It's great music, right? - Hugo ... - Yeah. - Twelve years ago ... Twelve years ago ... - Good thing I don't have kids. - You're right. I do not want to know him better. - he doesn't understand. - I don't need him. - He's your dad. - He's a guy who slept with my mother. - You have to tell him it's not fair. If you do not tell, I will tell him. - If you tell, I will kill you And I will not go to your funeral. Goodbye, Sam. - Tess. - Sam! Damn it, come here. - All week we wanted you to come with us, but I don't know where you wandered. - Hello, we're talking to you. - I was with Tess. - And how could we know that? - It's our vacation together. - Okay, tomorrow, you will stay with us all day. - Tomorrow is the last day. - Yeah, that's why. - Sam, look at me, okay? - Okay. If Tess does not tell Hugo, maybe I should not. You see? It's best not to get too attached to people. Sorry Mom and Dad, I want to be alone a little. Sam - Help! Somebody help! Help! Things weren't supposed to happen so. In fact, I will not be the last person on earth, I am, who first goes to his death. - I'm stuck! Thanks. - This old man has pulled many things from the sea, but never a child. You didn't know it's very dangerous in the muddy ground? Here. Slurp it. - Is that your wife? - Yes. - Still alive? - No. That's how it is. That's life. - Is it sad... being completely alone? - Still missing her, every minute of the day, but by a lot of wonderful memories. I lived more than half my life with her and she lives on in my head. Guarding every moment we spent together. I wish I would have had a little more. Many people collect money others collect stamps. One day I heard about a man, who has a special collection of Kinder surprise eggs. Memories you must collect, as much as possible, shared moments, Before it is too late. - Memories ... Hugo and Tess missed over 11 years of memories. That's 4,015 days. - STOP! ! ! - Sam, are you crazy? - You cannot leave. - We have to reach the ferry. - I have to tell you something. - What is it? - Sam, we're running out of time, we'll miss the boat. - Step aside, Sam. - Tess is your daughter. - What? What nonsense are you talking? She said that? That's nonsense. Tess has a very good imagination. That is all. Sorry Sam, I don't have kids. - Twelve years ago you didn't travel to Argentina? Together with Tess's mother. Then nine months later, Tess was born. - Ida ... - Tess wanted to tell you yesterday, but you said that luckily no child. Tess doesn't know I'm here. You can go safely to the boat and forget all this. - Sam, get in the car, we find Tess. - Say something! - Tess ... - Sam, what does this mean? - I'm so glad you're here, Dad. - I'm glad that I'm here too, son. I'm glad you're here. - To our last supper. - To our last evening here. - What was your highlight of the week? - When you fell in the bowling alley. - Don't you know how slippery those shoes are? Are you okay? - Yes. - The phone number on the plaster? - It's just a gift. - Gift. - Whose number? - Is that the doorbell? - We have a doorbell? Womanizer. - Pass me the cucumber salad? - Of course. - Can I have your beans? - Sam, they're looking for you. - Have you come to kill me? I'm sorry, I should not have ... It was a stupid idea, and it wasn't fair to hurt you ... - Sam. He asked me ... Hugo wants to be my father. - Really? - Really. I've come to invite you. - Us? - Yes, you and your family. Hugo and I arranged a small get-together. The taxi will come for you in an hour. - Stop, stop here! - Stop? - Yes, park it. - What are you doing? - I'll be right back. Hille! Hille, wake up. Hille? - Hi, Sam. - Let me ask you ... would you like a new good memories? You do not feel like coming to a party? - Party? But, why not? And you? - I present to you, Hille. - Welcome. - Well hold on. - Say you can tell us. How did this happen? - What? - Hugo could not do all this? - Do you have enough time to listen? - Yes. - He really did not know about his daughter? - Anybody want some chicken? - Anyone? - Magnificent. - You want some chicken? - Yeah, thanks. - This is the girl from the fish stand. - Get off. Maybe it was the strangest week of my life, and also the best. I have not been training to be alone, I want to collect a lot of memories, as much as possible. This is what now I'm collecting, many, many memories for the future.
