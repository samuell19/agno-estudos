[announcer] Please welcome to the red corner: Fallon Fox! [Fox] Back in 2008, I went to a fitness gym.I was trying to get in shape. And one of the physical trainers there asked me what apparatus I wanted to train on. &quot;Let's try that punching bag.&quot; So, I went over there and gave a couple of punches in the punching bag. He liked the way that I hit the bagand that I wasn't timid about it. Then he took me from there into an MMA gym. And everything kind of snowballedfrom there. [announcer] Fallon Fox turns her up like a pretzel! [Clemens] The two years that I was here at Artesia, we were one of the top teams. We had all of the hot major colleges come in recruiting at games. I don't want to say I was treatedas a superstar here. But people always helped me left and right because they thought that I was going to be this big time college player. The plan originally was to play varsity, going to college, and then the NBA, hopefully, afterwards. Things just didn't go the way I planned. [announcer] Fallon Fox with a high knee! Evans-Smith in trouble! [Fox] In the past I thought of the ideaof doing a documentary. In some ways I guess I am afraid that maybeit could be a bad thing for my career. [Clemens] Right now it's me piecing what I think could happen. Instead of saying, &quot;This athlete came out and was banned from this or... &quot;Nothing happened.&quot; I don't know. So, it's very scary right now. [Fox] It's such a complicated issue. Because I know there's a possibility that people will come after me and they're not going to understand. So, I have to be ready. You know, just like in MMA, &quot;Be ready.&quot; [announcer] Here comes Fallon Fox striking out! The crowd is going bananas! [man] Yeah! [Fox] Every time I see that skyline I'm like, &quot;Wow.&quot; It makes me feel like I'm part of something big. Like I'm really a part of the city. The last five years of my life has been this. I was training in the morning,training at night, I lived in the gym. This sport is my world right now. This is what I do. Words can't even express how much it means to me. In the beginning I had questions about my participation in MMA. I was having a hard time getting fights, possibly because there was a rumor out there that I was transgender. [announcer] Your winner by triangle choke, from Schaumburg, Illinois, Fallon &quot;Queen of Swords&quot; Fox! [people cheering] [Fox] I broke down at my gym and I toldmy first trainer. That was hard. My coaches expressed that they didn't want me to come out. They were like, &quot;If you come out now no one will fight you, &quot;it will reflect badly on the gym.&quot; I don't think they ever want me to come out. I find myself playing devil's advocate with myself, to try and have to express myself to everyone. It's very, very hard. It's like a 24-hour thing. Luckily, I had a couple of friends. Hey, you. It's been like two years? It's so cold here. Because it's Chicago, dude. [Allums] The reason why I'm reaching out to other trans athletes is because I did not have that when I was younger. I did not have someone to help me figure out who I was. All I had was people telling me that I was wrong for feeling the way I was feeling. And that wasn't the case at all. [Fox] I actually met Kye through the NCLR, which is the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Kye was really awesome. I really enjoy the conversations that we've had and being able to share our experiences as being transgender athletes. When people find out about me, you instantly see that confusion and then they start thinking about all these things and, like, &quot;Wait, what?&quot; So, you, like, &quot;Wait, What?&quot; It's like... You don't need to think about all that. It's not that serious. If I say I'm a trans guy, the only thing you should be focusing on is okay, so, male pronouns. Actually, I was a truck driver for a good four years and I transitioned on the job as a truck driver. I hadn't had surgery yet and they knew me as male before and then I switched over overnight. I just came in and I told them I was coming in next week. And I told my boss everything and he was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; I came in and then everybody was like... About a month or two after, guys were just coming on to me. And trying to hook up. In front of everyone, too. And these are like truck driver guys. Yeah? For me, it was more the body. You know, like, being able to... Comfortable with yourself... Be comfortable with myself and my body in addition to, like... some traditional female things... Perhaps not. Like right now I'm doing MMA and that's, like, not considered a traditional female thing to do. Here are all the trophies I've gotten over the years. Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19... Twenty different awards within two years. Jesus, so you just kick ass basically. [Fox] My objective is to fight for the UFC or Invicta. Preferably Invicta, if I can, because it's a female promotion. So, what I need to do now isto apply for a license in California. Being that California is the moststringent state as far as licensing policies go. I know that the commission needs to look through all my medical records, as far as this is concerned in conjunction with my sport. Like, California asked me what surgeries I had, and I told them everything. After I get a license in California, my coaches should be a little bit more behind me. For the simple fact that if I can get a license in California, more then likely I'll be licensed anywhere else. We just have to wait and see. [Clemens] Wow. It's been forever. A lot of memories. A lot of memories. Coming into my freshman year, I played for a traveling team. It was called the LA City Wildcats. We all kinda made a pact to each other that we wanted to play with each otherin high school since we all grew up playing witheach other in junior high. So, we all decided that we wouldcome here and play on the same team. It's funny, I get asked a lot aboutJames Harden, the NBA player. Growing up he wasn't the best one on our team. He sprouted up after his ninth grade year and grew about four or five inches over a summer. He could already shoot, dribble...So, adding the height to it, it gave him everything that he needed. He went ahead and continuedplaying basketball at a high level. The summer of my sophomore year, going into my junior year, I just heard the rumor that I was here at a party and they caught me in bed with a guy or something. A couple of guys reached out to me and asked me was it true. Especially at that time I denied it. I maybe didn't handle the situationthe right way, because I didn't know what to do to maintain my reputation as a basketball player. My teammates, they just... They would act like they were okay with it, but our relationship was just different. They stopped talking to me on a regular basis, stopped inviting me to places. It was very hurtful. These were guysthat I knew since childhood, guys I called brothers, just disowned me basically. I was supposed to play varsity my junior year. It didn't happen. And I talked to the coach andI just went ahead and I moved back to Crenshaw High School. After I left, they won the State Championship my junior year. It was like someone stabbed me in the back, basically. It hurt. It really did. I felt like that was my championshipthat I didn't get to be part of. We're number one, baby, we're number one! When I got here to Crenshaw, I met some guys and considered them family. And that was more so because they were going through the same situation that I was going through as far as hiding our sexuality. Most of them were out trying to take care of themselves at young ages of 16, 17. They were stealing, credit card fraud, basically any kind of scam that couldkeep money in their pockets. I guess the freedom and to be able to have your own money and just to hang with those guys it kinda drew me in. And got in trouble, got caught. Those ten months being incarcerated,it doesn't seem real. It kind of hit me hard, you know,that I was once looked at as, you know, the kid that was supposed to make it out, and come back and help the community. But that dream had basically had died at that point. One guy, his name, he went by Chums. While I was in there with him, he would always talk to me and he would tell me, &quot;Jail is not for you.&quot; There's just something I see in you that you won't be back here. It was like a signal from God saying, &quot;Let this be your last time. I'm worth more than this.&quot; -[ball dribbling] -[shoes squeaking] Here you go! [groans] Good job, Terrence, good! Yeah. Terrence came to me and he told me, &quot;Okay, I've been incarcerated. &quot;And that's where I've been.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I don't judge. So, now what are we going to do?&quot; He said, &quot;I want to continue to play basketball.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, well, let's start working!&quot; [Clemens] I was thinking that basketball could be my ticket out. Of everything that's going wrong right now. Basketball could help my life go in the right direction. I liked his drive and I liked thathe was determined to be good. We would work out at five in the morning. He would show up. No complaints. To me it felt like, you know, &quot;This kid really wants it.&quot; And he just kept coming back. When you shoot free throws you don't bent your knees. Ray Allen can get away with it. You and I can't get away with it. [Plaster] Coach Allen told me about Terrence'sbackground a little bit. Where he was coming from and what he was trying to do. At the end of the day I'm a suckerfor those kind of stories. Down, down, down! Corner, corner, corner! Tuck, tuck, tuck. Tuck. [Clemens] Coach Nick has a friend that's an assistant coach in Oklahoma. So he reached out to him to see if he would consider giving me a scholarship opportunity. At the end of the day, a lot of this stuff is a leap of faith, you know. You kind of take a chance and you hope it works out. [Clemens] The day I got the call, I actually missed it. I woke up to six missed calls. And I checked my voice mail and it was the coach from Oklahoma. And he said that I've been given a scholarship and they would like for me to fly out the next week. And at that moment I just... I was overwhelmed. Just the fact that going from being in prison and people laughing at me and tellingme that I'm not a basketball player, that I could go ahead and give that dream up, too. Now, receiving a call from a coachtelling me that I have a scholarship and my schooling will be paid for. I was just filled with joy at that moment. Right now my main focus is basketball. Basketball and school. As far as coming out with my sexuality, with this being a two year school, odds are I won't come out there, but we never know. It can be a good story, or it could be a bad story. I think it can be something special. [people shouting indistinctly] [fires gun] [girl] Come on, Taylor! Come on, Taylor! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Nice Job! -Good job. -Thank you. You did good so far. [Taylor] We are very much alike. A lot of people tell us that. Open mindedness. Determination. Beauty! I thought that was the cutest little photo. [Taylor giggles] Yes! [Fox] We feed off each other. And that's like one of the main things, our determination, our goals, sports. Drive to accomplish things. I got some older pictures way back here. That one is my favorite. [Fox] Yes, that was before I left for the military. [Taylor] When I first found out that Fallonwas going through a change, I was just, like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Like I did not have any problem with it. My other mother in Ohio, she doesn'tnecessarily agree with it. But she's still grateful that Fallontreats me the way she does. The problem with telling people at my school, like, I wouldn't mind telling them, but it's her privacy that I'm worried about. I try not to tell people unless they're my close friends who I know wouldn't judge her or anything. And if anybody messes with you... -She'll just beat them up. -They're toast. [Taylor] Gay pride parade. [laughs] With all my friends. It's kind of a difficult thing that my parents have always accepted my daughter. They never had a problem with her. But my mother is embarrassed to have me around. For the longest time I couldn't even show up at her house. They said if I don't change the wayI see myself, I was going to go to hell. And that I would be in an eternal lake of fire. Forever burning. And I couldn't stop what was going on inside of my head. There was nothing I could do about it. It came to a point were I felt that I was going to commit suicide... because of it. It's kind of saddening to hear that, you know, that she was thinking about committing suicide. Because... [sniffles] [voice breaking] I don't know what I would do without her. [Fox] There is a lot of stuff that I had togo through to get here. A lot of pain and a lot of suffering. The only thing on my mind is just helping out other people like me. In this particular circumstance right now. [Clemens] At first it really didn't hit me. It was just like a TV show to me, basically. I kind of was ready to get out of Los Angeles. So, it was more so like you need to get here and adjust. And try not to be so shocked when you get there. [Grover] It's difficult for them to adjust. Our town is 12,000 people. So, there's a lot of kudos to those players who come here from big cities, and learn how to adapt. [Clemens] I was pretty much homesick for the first couple of weeks. If I didn't have to be somewhere, I was in my room. Ready? Ball! Ball! Ball! All I'm hearing is, &quot;Ball, ball, ball,&quot; and &quot;Gap, gap, gap.&quot; Talk to each other. You got him! I got him! [Clemens] My experience with this team whenI first joined was a little rocky. He didn't sign with us until he actually got here on campus, which was about a week into school. We thought our team was already set. I guess we didn't have that welcome feeling because he wasn't there from the beginning. He was a little older than us. He wasn't really hanging with us and stuff like that. Unbelievable... It's like we're dealing with frigging third graders. We actually called a meeting to start playing better. And it came up during the meeting that they were all purposely being mean to me, so that I wouldn't want to stay here. And that was kind of shocking. We speak to him off court, but hekeeps his convos short. He didn't say very much, so, it was rubbing us kind of the wrong way. Him coming in, it didn't fit well at all. Be together. Fight together. No individual agendas. -Go Norse! -Go NEO! [music playing] Here we go! Hey, pinch down. Pinch down. Second turnover. Getting a group of guys that are from different parts of the States and the world, it's hard for us to all gel together. [announcer] Checking in for the Golden Norseman, number 24, Terrence Clemens. [Grover] To be quite honest with you, when we first got him, I looked at him kind of almost as a backup backup. Get in, Terrence. Good hands. He can't score! First couple of months when he first got here, he didn't play very well. I thought he was very guarded in what he did. That led to him not being very good on the floor. [announcer] Foul from number 24, Terrence Clemens. Terrence. Terrence! -[buzzer rings] -You embarrassed yourselves. Good job, good luck. [band music playing] When we win, we sit here and talk about the game. Because we lost y'all don't want to talk about it. I'm telling you all what happened. Every other game someone else is mad and we sit and talk. Nobody's telling me to shut up, so I'm just gonna keep on talking. [clamoring] All I'm doing is having a conversation, so why are you mad? Somebody go in there and turn the water off so I can talk. Did you not take them seriously? Murray State? I see a bunch of individuals. &quot;I'm not going to work hard on this, &quot;because, hell, I don't know, I'm not gonna trust my teammate. &quot;I don't want to be a team.&quot; You say we give you excuses. Every time we try to say something you just change the subject. Or you just write off whatever we're saying. And it doesn't matter what we say you always have an answer for it. Completely disagree. So, there's no point in anybody saying-- Completely disagree. That's my point right there. I have to agree with Jeff. Don't be negative about it. Everyone get on board. Let's make it a positive thing instead of hanging our heads and saying we need to do a Kumbaya session. Everyone get on freaking board. Does that make sense? [all] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen. Are we going to bring it in? -Go Norsemen. -Go NEO. [music playing] So... [clears throat] I just came back from running. Earlier today we had a press conference. I talked a little smack. I'm looking forward to snapping some arms and breaking some faces for you. So, look for me. So far I don't think anybody suspects that I'm trans. I just don't need the stress right now. I just don't fucking need it. You know... It would take me forever to try and get people to understand. But tomorrow's a big day. We'll see what happens tomorrow. [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready? Three rounds. The winner will advance to the semi-finals in CFA11. [crowd cheering] [commentator 1] Ericka Newsome comes out, delivers a strike. And Fallon now takes the top. These girls are getting right into it. Fallon Fox with a knee kick and that's it! Fallon Fox! [commentator 2] What a beautiful knee. [commentator 1] Unbelievable. Game over! [crowd cheering] Looks like tomorrow, or actually this morning in a couple of hours... I'm going to hit the media. What happened was... this guy... Marrocco, I believe his last name was. After my last fight he called me. He said something along the lines of, &quot;If what I've been told is true, &quot;you may want to have a lot of time to discuss this matter.&quot; Which, at that point, threw up a big red flag in my mind. And I told him, &quot;Hey, I got to go!&quot; I knew this was coming and I knew, at some point, someone was going to say something. And it's been years and years of torture. Wondering when that shoe was going to drop. Wondering when I'm gonna get that phone call. And I just got the phone call... Ladies and gentlemen, I'm standing here next to your victor, Fallon. I'm feeling excellent. That was sweet? -Did you like that? Yeah! -[crowd cheering] It felt really good this weekend for people to look at me as a normalfemale MMA fighter. And I know that in the minds of a lot of them they're going to see me as something other. And I really liked the feeling of being perceived to be just like everyone else, which I am. [woman] Fallon Fox! [man 1] Fallon Fox! [man 2] Fallon Fox! She is an MMA fighter. It's not her undefeated record that has everyone talking. She is a transgender female. She wants to now join the UFC. But is it fair for someone who used tobe a man to fight a woman? [man 3] She has an Illinois drivers license... ...stating she is female. And she circled female on her FloridaState Boxing Commission application. So, neither the FSBC nor the CFAfounder and CEO Jorge De La Noval were aware that Fallon is a transgender female. I pity the woman who comes up againsther knockout knee to the head. What the fuck? Transgender fighters should be taken by case by case basis. You can't say that a 145 pound woman and a 145 pound man are even. Bone structure is different, hands are bigger, jaw is bigger. Everything is bigger. Six years of taking performance dehancing drugs you think is going to change all that? That's ridiculous. -Let her fight RuPaul. -Okay. That's fair. I'll whoop her. I mean I'll whoop him. -You'll whoop him? -I'm confused. I can't keep up with everything. It's coming in so fast. This week the state's Boxing Commission may decide if the transgender MMA fighter cancan get back in the ring as a woman. She didn't lie on her application. There was no question about this. [Foster] I want to be very clear about that point. Fallon Fox never lied. Fallon Fox never misrepresented. For many years the IOC, the International Olympic Committee, has developed a policy on transgender. And she qualifies to compete as a woman for MMA, no question about it. Here's the deal, if you look at those two women side by side, you would think Ericka has got the advantage. Everyone who competes in MMA has different things they're good at. Some are good wrestlers. Some just have brute strength. So, it's hard to say who has the advantage. You can even argue that there may be disadvantages... ...because they have to fight in a higher weight category. But they don't necessarily have the muscle to support that. When you undergo treatment like she has, there will be a lot of changes in bone density, and many other things in the body. The upper body strength, grip strength, stronger, denser bones... But all that apparently indeed disappears. I didn't know that before, so we did our homework. That's right. We do our homework. Don't ever be a doctor on TV unless you're a doctor. [Aaron] When you are sitting down at CNN tomorrow with Kyra Philips, and they ask you the question, &quot;What do you say to people who sayyou shouldn't compete?&quot; You can say that that question has already been answered. The International Olympic Committee,NCAA, the Boxing authorities, they all have rules in place, and you qualify under all of them. There has been some criticism, people, including some of your opponents who say it's not fair that you fight women when you were born a man. What do you say to your critics? I think for most part the reaction has been positive. It's just some people... Some of our... Some of society just doesn't get it yet. And that's what we're trying to do right now. Is to inform people and let them know about transgender athletes. In the next hour we will talk toFallon's opponent that you saw there Ericka Newsome, who she managed to knock out in a matter of seconds. Ericka, I want to, you know... you did just get kneed to the chin just seven days ago. How are you doing? That looked pretty brutal. I feel fine. What do you think you need to be better prepared for? Well, just knowing that... You know, that... Help me here. What she's trying to say is just knowing what you're getting into. Not having any disclosure of something of that nature, it puts a lot of stress after the fight obviously. [Fox] I think Ericka Newsome is a good person. I think she's just caught up with the wrong people who are trying to save face with her career and her loss. And that's not the right thing that she should be doing. Father, we thank You for today. We thank You for our food. We thank You in Jesus' name for all of our friends here today, Father. Amen. [all] Amen. Yes. All righty. Who was it that requested meatloaf? [woman] Terrence. [man] All right. I like that. Most of them just call me Lisa or Miss Lisa. They don't really call me mom. But they come in a lot to the office. I'm right there in the gym. Is there something I don't know? We all call you mom on campus. [Lisa] I get asked questions aboutsituations that they're going through, like family, girlfriends, we need a band-aid, we need aspirins,&quot;Do you have any candy?&quot; Terrence was a little unusual. A lot of the players come in kind of a little more cocky. Terrence came in a little quiet. In fact I was thinking, &quot;Man, he's awfully quiet.&quot; You know. But then I got to know him and he'snot near as quiet as I thought he was. Now the thing I love is, I call him Mr. NEO. You know, because everybody knows Terrence. Everybody. [laughing] Why are you on camera right now? I'll tell you later. Will you be there tonight? All right, I'll see you then. What's up, buddy? You doing all right? Yes, sir. Hey, I know it's late because your birthday was in January. But happy birthday! This is really, like... This is going up in my room. And you know I don't have anything hanging up on my wall. I am who I really am here, I'm just not open about my relationship. Everything else, I am who I am everyday. I'm not faking it by going out of my way to say, &quot;Hi.&quot; That's just me. [people cheering] [whistle blows] [Clemens] They know me as the basketball player and they get a sense of who I am as a person, through basketball. But it still feels like they don't know the real me. Here, you have to have your game face on. Thank you. Thank you. Terrence, good job. Little celebrity. [Clemens] Sometimes I may have a plan, but then I'm nervous about going through with it. I just... I don't know how to go about it. That's another area where I would want to call somebody and get some advice, but who do I call now? For the first time an active maleplayer in a major team sport has announced today that he is gay. Jason Collins played college ballat Stanford and for 12 NBA seasons, he's played in two NBA finals, and he's been a part of six NBA teams. So, you send this thunderbolt out into the world twelve hours later, how does it feel? It's incredible. I'm just trying to live an honest, genuine life and next thing you know, you have the President calling you. Yeah, I told him I couldn't be prouder of him. The LGBT community deserves full equality. Not just partial equality. I applaud you, Jason Collins. I applaud you. [male presenter] Katy Perry, Dwayne Johnson, and even a former President of the United States, tweeted their support for the NBA'sfirst openly gay player. [Clemens] To me that was a big shocker. Kobe Bryant tweeted him. Magic Johnson tweeted him. David Stern tweeted him and said they actually support himand they were proud of him. Personally, I don't believe that you can live an openly homosexual lifestyle. I believe that's walking an open rebellion to God. [Clemens] I mean, it doesn't bother me, but it does make me think there are more people out there like him, that don't want to give us a chance to be in the sports world. [music playing] What I heard in my locker room? I heard a couple of students sayingsome negative things, like, &quot;They got a fagot on the team.&quot;&quot;He would be your shower buddy.&quot; Something like that. And that's where it kind of offends me. Because it's not as if we are there trying to be sexual towards a teammate or anything. We are professionals just like they are professionals. This goes across the board to anyone gay or straight that you make choices in your life that make you happy. Truly happy. And allow you to live an honest and genuine life. Whatever that may be. [Clemens] Before him I didn't have anyone to look to. I would want to sit there and ask him, &quot;Can I personally have you to support me, &quot;to help me with making decisions, &quot;through everything that I'm going through.&quot; That would be my question. [Fox] Tonight we are going to American Predator, the promotion that I had my firstMMA fight in. It's a possibility I might get some bad reactions, it's probably gonna happen. But I'm just not going to worry about it and do my thing. I would think that my parents would have gotten wind of this by now. Nobody has called you in the family? Nobody has called me. Nobody's said jack shit. All I ever wanted is just to be able to fight MMA and be able to have a team that stands behind me. If I would ever come out, like, try and go to another gym, Who's going to fucking roll with me? You guys already know me and I'm comfortable with you guys. I don't want to go anywhere else. You guys are like my family. Seriously, I get fucking choked up just thinking about it. I'm still just bothered by all the other YouTube videos of what everybody is saying. It seemed like they wanted to jump on the bandwagon and act like they were specialists at everything. [Fox] Scottie Fortner. Did you know that chick is askingfor her belt back? Like, &quot;Fallon, give her her belt back.&quot; Who said that? I'm like, &quot;No!&quot; Her family, somebody Fortner. A couple of them. Twittering me or Facebooking me. They were asking for the belt back. I'm like, &quot;No, this belt is mine.&quot; I should twitter, but I'm not. Yeah, don't twitter. She can have it back... if she comes and takes it. [laughs] [rock music playing] [man] Grab his leg! [inaudible] Cheers. What's up, stud, are you all right? I'm doing good. You'll be fine. -I got nothing, but respect for you. -Thank you. -Keep doing what you're doing, okay? -I appreciate it. -Keep kicking ass. -I will. That was the first guy I ever trained with. [woman] You are awesome. I support you all the way. Thank you for everything that you said. My church is over there. My pastor is not here that I told you about, but the other pastor's here. Acceptance. That's it. Yes! Yes! [crowd cheering] That was pretty sick. How is your daughter? She's been good. She hasn't had anything negative said to her. Not at school or nothing? -That's what she's telling me, so... -Good. Nobody's said anything bad about you. Not one person. A couple of people are like, &quot;Man, that's wild,&quot; but nobody said anything negative. Nobody has said, &quot;No fucking way am I training with her.&quot; Now, let's see what happens when you're in their training book. I think it's good that I've been away for a little while -for people to digest it. -For sure. -You know what I mean? -It was a crazy week. [Fox] So, far tonight I didn't really...Like, I get a lot of stares. Like I'm sitting here talking to people more than normal. I talked to a few people here and there. They didn't want to support it or say anything about it. Some old school fighters, they support it, but at the same time they're kind of against it. They don't know what to think. I think some of the female fighters in there tonight were probably just being nice in front of the camera. I don't know. -Sick win. -Nice to meet you. [Fox] The one who won tonight she kindaran away for awhile. I just couldn't really tell. It couldbe my own personal paranoia. You never know who's gonna be for or against you. Nice job. Thanks. We are positive. We got a lot more positive than negative, so... Yeah. -It was a good night. -Yeah. [Fox] I haven't had one negative commentfrom a fighter in here. They're all training with me, rollingwith me, doing ground fighting with me, sparring with me and everything. [Joe] The situation with Fallon has changedmy outlook on transgenders competing. I was against it at the beginning. Now I'm more accepting to it. As long as they're doing the proper testing and licensing and all that. [Fox] Joe has come a long way, I think, from before when I first told him and after everything has come out. I think it's made him feel more comfortable that he knows he's not going to get sued. [Joe] I was afraid that it was going to havea negative impact on our reputation, and what we're trying to do here. We were worried that students herewouldn't want to train with her, coaches might have a problem with her.All that were legitimate concerns. Limit yourself to three and four. Jab cross hit cross. Jab cross kick. Double jab cross kick. They licensed her. I'm going to train her to fight. That's my job. [Fox] I have about a month before my fight. I wonder if anything is going to besaid there by any of the other fighters. [Alex] The goal and the focus has to be on winning. All this media and all these people aren't going to be here if we don't keep winning. She has to stay relevant or this story becomes just something that goes by the wayside. &quot;Play hard&quot; on three. One, two, three, &quot;Go hard!&quot; Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. No. No. No. Get down there, post up. [Clemens] A few years ago I never could have imagined there was an organization called the National Gay Basketball Association. Basketball is just an excuse for us to get together. Gay basketball is not a sexual thing. Hopefully there will come a day wedon't have to put &quot;gay&quot; in front of it and it's just basketball. But until people are not marginalized, it's important. [whistle blows] That's all ball! [Clemens] When I come here, I'm relaxed, I'm free, I meet people that are like me. And to me that's the best thing that I could have. Especially being a gay player working on coming out. [Jervon] I absolutely adore playing with Terrence. I think it's good that he wants to come out, but I think he should be careful about it. It's not always a fairy tale. [Clemens] Besides basketball, my teammate Jervonis also a great football player. A few years ago, he had a scholarshipto play college football for Delaware State University. It was me and four others from my school who were offered a full scholarship to Delaware State to come play. I had a boyfriend at that time who had come up to visit me. We were having lunch together on campus and I kissed him. Like a week or so later, I got a call back into the coach's office. He said, &quot;Jervon, we need to talk to you. We've had a lot of guys come inand say they don't feel comfortable &quot;having you in the locker room.&quot; And I was like, &quot;I don't even go in the locker room most of the time.&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, but still. &quot;They shower and don't feel comfortable with you in there.&quot; I was like, &quot;So, what does that mean?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, next semester &quot;we will not cover you under a football scholarship.&quot; The fact that I had a full scholarship and then had it taken away from me, because I didn't do anything to lose it. To have it taken way from me, after all the hard work and to see all these bills coming in, I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; Sometimes, I regret kissing my boy... He's my ex now. But I regretted it. Because it cost me just about everything. Pick your man up full court. I don't care if you got somebody real small. Get up on them. We're going to help. That's what I'm talking about. [rock music playing] [people clapping] For the co-main event of the evening we have Allanna Jones and Fallon Fox. And I want to mention something real quick. Allanna, thank you for taking this fight right away. We've had a bunch of meetings when the whole controversy broke out. Fallon Fox landing here in South Florida tonight. Some critics argue she should not be fighting women. I think Allanna Jones is a very strong fighter with a lot of heart. And I think this is going to be an exciting match. Well, I had to do some diligence and get some more information, get educated on the subject. Because all the girls were backing out. People were threatening us that we had to cut her. People were saying that they were going to ban the event. -Hey, I'm Mike. -Nice to meet you, Mike. After going through this long journey, I'm very happy to have this opportunity. We want to do a separate feature for CFA. I'm the photographer. We need to do it fast, because I still need to eat. I want to comply as much as we can, but not at the sacrifice of her. Nothing is more important than the fight and the preparation. The media unfortunately is just the opposite. It's a distraction. Don't allow them to create the sense that they're more important and you have to do this or that. You have to fight and they have to pay you. That's it. Here's the thing. The PR team is trying to get me positive PR -versus the negative PR. -Right. Because it benefits them and me. I think... You have to be polite about it. And you can coordinate it. If somebody's not treating you right or making you uncomfortable, you don't have to stay in any situation. All right, ladies and gentlemen, now,for you co-main event of the evening. Fallon Fox fighting out of the redcorner versus Allanna Jones. Semi-finals of the all women's tournament. The winner will meet Ashlee Evans-Smith. [man 1] Fallon Fox is making a mockery of women's MMA. [man 2] That is a lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak. We have extra security to take precautions. But to be honest we you we don't expect any of that. I'm sure they've done tests and stuff like that, you know. If they say it's okay then it's okay. [woman] It's great that she wants to be a woman and that's who she is inside. But her body is not a woman's body. I don't know I probably have to do a little bit of my own research. I think that he's got an advantage. [Fox] People are going to come after me. They're not going to understand. So I have to be ready. It's time! I'm a fighter. Never take the easy way out. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcometo the blue corner, Allanna Jones! [crowd cheering] [playing &quot;Dude (Looks Like A Lady)&quot;] [commentator 1] She did it. [laughs] [commentator 2] Allanna Jones. With that song choice. [commentator 1] I guess somebody had to do it. [announcer] And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to bring her opponent to the cage. Please welcome to the red corner,Fallon Fox! [music playing] [commentator 2] Fallon Fox receiving a mixed reception from this Miami crowd, here. She comes in as the overwhelming favorite. Minus 18-50 they come back at Allanna Jones. Allanna Jones would bring the house down if she could cause an upset here tonight. It's the moment we've been waiting for. Controversial transgender fighterFallon Fox on her television debut. [commentator 1] Outside leg kick from Fox. The round kick of that right leg is extremely powerful. Yeah, she has good round kicks. This is not where she wants to be. Hit her with the arm. Hit her with the arm. That's a nasty shoulder lock if you get caught in that. Fallon Fox turns her up like a pretzel. Allana Jones coming up. Getting up to her base. Nice job. Allana Jones survives! [crowd cheering] Don't be cocky, okay? Pressure and get her on top. Let's go. [commentator 1] Single leg here. [commentator 2] She's going to hit her if she got herarms locked like that. The roll there it is. Allanna looking for a way to get back on her feet. Allanna Jones will see the end of the second round. She'll see it quite nicely.And we'll move into a third round. Two down one remaining. I want you to hide the fatigue. Come out there looking sharp. Don't do too much. Remember what we said? Pace yourself five minutes. -She's tired. -I know she is. [commentator 2] High round right kick from Fallon Fox. And now a high left round. Allanna brings up her forearms nicely. She catches the kicking leg. It's amazing how much Fallon is stillin control of the fight however. Still winning this fight, did slow downafter the first round. [commentator 1] Yeah. Double leg from Fallon. Gets her down the earliest we've seen so far in this fight. There it is. [commentator 2] She's going to lock it up. Chin across the throat. Knee on the throat. And Allanna Jones taps out! A knee across the throat from Fallon Fox. Allanna Jones taps out in the third and final round. Fallon Fox comes up strong. [announcer] Fallon &quot;Queen of Swords&quot; Fox! [crowd booing and cheering] [commentator 1] I can hear that mixed reaction. Boos, jeers, and applause for Fallon Fox. This crowd is divided as much as the world is about her. That was pretty cool though. It was half and half. Boos and cheers. [man] For sure. I think you won a lot of supporters, like people who didn't know because your game was tight. And you know, there are the drunk &quot;bros.&quot; But it was really funny that half of their girlfriends were like, &quot;What?&quot; And then by the third round, they were cheering for you. [Fox] I think her whole idea was to play the song, For sure, and then run. ...frustrate me, and run. Her mentality was, &quot;I'm going to take this as far as I can,&quot; and she did. Because this is not going to be the last time, and this is now experience for the future. [man] Drinks on Fallon tonight? Right, yeah. Sure. Good luck to you. [Fox] I'm staying away from the media. I'm staying away from everybody for at least a couple of days. Go back to Chicago and just rest. Bye, see you later. [Clemens] At first I couldn't believe it. When I reached out to him for guidance, I never thought I would get a response back. Let alone, he would make the timeto meet me in person. Fun hike, huh? So, on a clear day you can see downtown from here. I don't have all the answers, but I can offer my advice. Because I know what it's like to begay in a locker room. [Clemens] I really haven't decided how to come out. I think it's like, the hardest thing for me to, you know... approach friends. So I haven't even thought about telling a coach and trying to get him to understand. Telling the coaches and telling the teammates... It's all about whatever is most comfortable for you. You try to do it in a way that keeps your dignity. So that you can always walk around with your head held high. [Clemens] After I tell my teammates, how do you deal with it going back in the gym? To work out, to practice... Because the jokes are already there. You know I love to laugh. I think humor can heal a lot. A. You have to be able to take a joke. But at the same time educate, but in a humorous way with some people who might have an issue with it. That's something I have to work on as a person is being more jokative with my teammates. If you ask them I'm pretty much a serious guy. And I think that comes from me being a private person with everything. [Collins] And people respect that. You have to have that sense of who you are. It's a matter of finding that point of acceptance. Have you ever been booed by your home crowd? No, not my home crowd. You haven't lived in sports until you get booed by your home crowd. Okay? You're going to have haters. People who you might think will have your back, they might not. You got to forgive. And trust me, it's easier said that done. I know it. But you forgive them and you move on. It translates in every part of my life that when you have less stress, you're able to play better. You're able to be yourself and relax. I think that's just the ultimate goal, is to be happy, honest and just be your genuine self. You know, it's going to be tough, going into the realm of sports and try to change a culture and a mind set. But I'm a part of it. You're a part of it. Every person who steps forward and raises their hand, is a part of changing that culture. This is so nice. If I had this at my house. When I first met you, you were telling me about all the things you have been through. Like truck drivers, the army, and like just... You've been through so much shit. That right there is the definition of what a woman is. Women get through tough shit and you have been through some tough ass shit. And you're still here. That's a woman. A strong ass woman. I'm so proud of you. These guys can beat you on the court and in the ring. Oh, my God. He's got a huge head. Last year I was the only trans person here. Now, I got you, Chris and Corey. It's baby steps. Chris, your muscles are so much bigger than Fallon's. I was trying so hard! There are so many differences between the way that our stories play out. Because no one gave me any sort of advantage in becoming male. I'm competing specifically against men now. No one thought that I could win or be competitive anymore. It's that lack of education that makes folks react in fear to our stories and sensationalize our stories. There's just a general lack of understanding of transgender issues. [crowd cheering] [all cheering] [Wade] Sometimes I look at Fallon and I marvel. I don't think that people understand that her coming out as a transgender, is even bigger than someone like myself or Jason Collins, because there's so much educationthat has to go along with that. Not only does sports culture knowvery little about what it is to be transgender, but American culture. And I just pray that she has the energy to not only be this amazing athlete, but to be this amazing activist and advocate, too. [Fox] It's amazing so much stuffhas transpired in such a short time. I have a stage right now. Before I didn't have much of a voice, but now I have a voice. Coming to the nation's capital. I can talk about trans people in the military, I can talk about the things that we have to endure and I have the chance to make a difference. I never thought that would be possible, but here it is. After I'm done fighting, I plan on doing a lot of activism work as much as I can. And a lot of these younger people here are some people that I really neededto connect with. What we've seen in the preseason is that Terrence has brought back that same level of intensity to this year. And he's competed for his job. Toughest. [all] Together. Go NEO. In fact, he'll start tonight for us,because he's earned that spot. [announcer] From Los Angeles, California. Number one, Terrence Clemens. [Clemens] I didn't want to miss the layup, but my teammate followed with a good dunk. And the crowd started celebrating thefirst official score of the season. [cheering] Go D right down the middle. Yeah! I think he's going to have anopportunity to move on from here, I imagine he'll get a four-year college offer sometime during the spring months. Did you like the dunk with the toilet paper? I like when you first made the sprint. The three? Give me five. So, I just got off of Facebook talking with Ms. Lisa and she found out. She said that she won't tell anybody. And we are going to meet up later and try to talk about it. I was like, I think totally unprepared. I was unprepared. I was unprepared. I never saw that coming. Here's the part that I don't understand. Miami Oklahoma Ottawa County is not really known for a real strong gay community. You know, I think there's reasonsthat it's not. You know what I mean? So... Why do you feel that it's important to come out and say, &quot;I am gay&quot;? It was eating at me. For a while I could deal with people not knowing. But now it eats at me, to not be truthful to people. And I thought, honestly, that it would be easier once I told my family... But it's not. It's more so the teammates becausewe are so &quot;buddy-buddy.&quot; &quot;Let me see your girlfriend.&quot; &quot;Who are you on the phone with?&quot; They even make gay jokes. You know, so... Everything is... And it's uncomfortable from both sides. The straight stuff is uncomfortableand the gay stuff is uncomfortable. So, if they knew, it wouldn't bother me either way. I hope... And I keep coming back to this being nervous. There's a part of me that is concerned. I would say, because we are a two-year, you know, it's better to either come out in the beginning or come out at the end. I think to come out in the middle is... I think would be asking for a lot of problems. In the middle I think you'll get side strung. [Clemens] It's like a feeling in your stomach telling me that, &quot;Just tell someone, &quot;just tell everybody, get it over with.&quot; Then I'm fighting with myself saying it's not the time. Beautiful, beautiful... You feel like a million bucks. [Fox] It's been a long time sincethe beginning of this tournament. Well, I'm going to put my heart, soul,technique, everything I've learned... I'm just going to pour it into this fight. To have that belt strapped around my waist, it's just going to be amazing. Here we go, South Florida,it's time to crown a new champion. Fighting out of the blue corner,she's undefeated, with one victory. Introducing Ashlee Evans-Smith. [crowd cheering] And now her opponent on my right,fighting out of the red corner. She also undefeated with three victories. Presenting Fallon &quot;Queen Of Swords&quot; Fox. [crowd booing and cheering] [commentator 1] Mixed reactions from the crowd here at the announcement of Fallon Fox. [bell dings] Outside leg kick from Fallon Fox early on. Look for the right hand of Ashlee Evans-Smith. She locks onto a single leg of Fallon. She gets Fallon on her back. Drills her pound for pound, side control. And the crowd is rallying for Ashlee Evans-Smith. The crowd is going bananas. They are thumping the rafters. We're fine. She's not hurting us. Let's go. [commentator] And now Fallon Fox finds a way back to her feet. [commentator 2] Fallon Fox with a high knee. Evans-Smith in trouble. Here comes Fallon Fox, check it out. Ashlee is almost done. Got to fight out of there. Got to fight out of there. Ashlee Evans-Smith turn back into herand puts Fallon Fox against the cage. [crowd chanting] Ashlee! No doubt who the crowd is behind here at the Bankunited Center in Miami. They're all chanting for Ashlee Evans-Smith. And she throws a wicked elbow. You're doing fine. You banged her with those knees up against the cage. Look to get that ass whooped and let's get fucking fired again. [bell dinging] [crowd cheering] [commentator 1] ...looks for the upper cut. And gets Fallon Fox on her back inside the opening minute of the second round. Up kicks here from Fallon. Tryingto plow through with the right hand. All right, let's go. We got to turn inside, we got to do something. [commentator 1] Can Ashlee catch her here [commentator 2] She does, she does. Knees buckle. Traps her in a corner. A sweet one-two. Fox, you got to move. Let's go. [commentator 1] Fallon Fox in her three fight pro career has never been in a situation like this. Listen to this crowd again, cheeringevery time Ashlee lands a strike. There is no love here in Miami for Fallon Fox. No, no... [commentator 2] Ashlee Evans-Smith is completely derailing her, pounding away to the face of Fox. Fox with nowhere to go. Ashlee Evans-Smith unloading. Right hand to the jawline. Hey... what the fuck? End of the round. She's done it, she's done it. Ashlee Evans-Smith beats Fallon Fox.Miami goes into ecstasy. Man, I'm filing a complaint, that was horrible, bro. You let her get beat up in the corner for an extra 20 seconds. Get the fuck out of here. [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, your winner and new CFA Female Featherweight World Champion Ashlee Evans-Smith. She's bigger than me. She's bigger. She's big and strong. Once she gets on top of you, you can't get her off of you. That's why we want you at 35. You're stronger, if you're not strong, you're just as strong. [Fox] You win some, you lose some. Just like anybody else. At least I went in there and just... I competed. You know? How many people can say that? How many trans people can go out there and be an MMA fighter? It's so fucking hard. I'll give myself credit. I'll give myself credit. [crowd] Ashlee! Ashlee! Ashlee! [commentator 1] Listen to these chants. Ashlee! Ashlee! Ashlee! [commentator 2] There is no love here in Miami for Fallon Fox. Thank you for going out there and trying. That's all I ask, all right? Proud of you. Thank you so much. I have nothing, but respect for you. I have no hate. It's really hard. I was coming out like the bad guy a lot of times. Like, &quot;You got to stand up for her.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It's my job to beat her,&quot; you know? You almost have to hate the person. It's crazy. This is the craziest sport ever. I love it so much. I have respect for you, so much respect for you. Congratulations, all right? I really feel like there should be a transgender organization. I don't feel like Fallon should fight dudes, I don't feel like she should fight women. I feel like there should be a unique organization for those needs, you know? She did have an advantage. [Clemens] I haven't received one letter from a college. I've had a few conversations with the assistant coach telling me that schools are interested, but no offers, no one has contacted me. I haven't had a coach text me or call me pertaining to next year. I'm just going to continue to work hard and pray that the right opportunityreveals itself. We still have the playoffs. A lot of coaches will be here for the playoffs and see me, so we'll see what happensand go from there. I don't need to soft sell it or try to hide from it. Every single one of you guys walked by the stands by a row of big time coaches. Marquette, Oklahoma State, Louisville, they're all sitting there in the front row. We understand that this level is all about getting recruited and get moving on to the next level. But I promise you. If you go out and play as a team and we make sure you're playing your roles. Those things are going to pay off down the long line. Getting a championship is what it's about. -Toughest. -Together. Go NEO! [chanting indistinctly] Defense! [cheering] Tomorrow we're focused on one single thing, we got to go and beat Conners. They fear us. -Let's go! Toughest. -Together. Go NEO! [buzzer sounds] That's why we have the deepest team. We can go up again all the time. Let's go! [crowd chants indistinctly] -[whistle blows] -[crowd cheering] Let's go, NEO! Let's go! Let's go! [buzzer sounds] -[whistle blows] -[crowd cheering] [cheering] We got it now? We're good? No problems? Okay. It ain't over, it ain't over. [cheering] Yes! [Clemens] It feels so good to win. My first championship came at the age of 25. Old man, old man. Make sure I don't fall. [people cheering] When I didn't win because I transferred, it hurt, because there was always a what if. Now, that I won this, there is no more what if. [indistinct cheering] That's what I'm talking about. [man] We're going to honor our award recipients, Hudson Taylor, Brendon Ayanbadejo... Can I do that again? Ayanbadejo. I'm sorry. And Fallon Fox. Tonight we celebrate their awe inspiring work on behalf of the LGBTQ Youth as well as their support of the Hetrick-Martin Institute. [cheering and applause] When I first started training for Mixed Martial Arts almost five years ago, I had no idea how any of this would turn out. But all the while, I had this fear that at any moment, I could be outed as a transsexual woman. But I knew who I was... I was a woman, a proud, black, lesbian woman, no matter what anyone else said about me. And I refused not to take my rightful place alongside my sister competitors. Even if it cost me my life, I will continue. I lost my last MMA fight, but I haven't lost the war. And I think if we all continue to walk into the light... until every LGBTQ person has their proper chance at happiness and prosperity, we can make things better for ourselves and for others. Thank you very much. [cheering and applause] -Good job, baby. -Was it good? Really good. It was very good. Everyone loved it. [Fox] Directly after the fight, I kind offelt isolated and alone. Especially after such a loss. If she wasn't there, I don't know howI would have handled it. [Amy] It is hard mostly because I want to be there live to support her. So, she can hear me, just to add someone to the crowd on her side. But usually with work and everything, I can't go. We do pretty well, seeing each other, building up to the fight. Tell the truth about, you know, when I'm cranky and I'm tired. That's not really hard, it's kind of cute. She gets cranky when she's hungry, when she's cutting weight. She'll get a little edgy. But I can handle it. I've been with way worse. And they weren't athletes. [Grover] I've been here nine years. And this group was more fulfilling than any team I've had. Because you're great people and we became one hell of a good basketball team. Just because we lost this last game and we didn't play well, does not mean that we weren't a good basketball team. There are a lot of teams throughout the country that didn't win a championship. And guys did. Okay? That's a hell of a job there. Nobody can take the championship away from you. Toughest. Together. Go NEO. Great year, buddy. Good two years. You guys were running into the big guy that was putting his hands up. Yeah. That's not how you will win it. You have to go around him next time. I'll remember that. -And dunk it? -Yes. Go around him and dunk? Yes. That's a lot. It's just two things. [Clemens] I love being here at this school. Told some people, I wish it were a four-year school. Because I've built these relationshipsfor two years. And every day I push myself to go outside my comfort zone, to become just a better person. As far as speaking to people. Thinking about people and their feelings. And just hoping that, my teammatesor whoever would see me for me. And not the title of being gay. First of all, thank you, everybody, for coming out. Most of you know, some know and some don't, that I have a criminal history. Before I came here, I got into a little trouble and went to jail. But there's more to the story than you guys know. I have been struggling with my sexuality for a long time. It's something that's really hard for me to talk about with people because... when you meet me, I guess, you see a basketball player or a young kid. And it's... Where I'm from, sorry. Where I'm from, it's not... I guess, correct to be gay. And I am. And... hopefully, what I want to accomplish is... to tell my story and let people understand that there is a person that's dealing with something more than what people can understand. I can't even explain how hard it is, you know? This is the first time that I've ever told a group of people about me. And all you guys mean something to me individually. And I pray that I can continue these relationships with you guys after this. Does that affect you as a person when they think differently? Well... I think I over-think it. So, it stresses me out at times. [man] You over-think everything. [laughter] [Clemens] That's true. That's true. But you're a great person just the way you are. [Clemens] Thank you. Thank you. And that's what I'm hoping that this is leading to. Me being able to be happy. And be who I am with everyone. -Well, it's a great story. -Thank you. [laughter] Thank you, guys, thank you so much. All right, that's it. No more questions. [applause] Hey, that was good. -Proud of you. -Thank you. You made me look at people so much different, man. I will always be here. Whatever you need, man. And you know I'm going to come watch you. I know, don't make me cry. [Grover] So many things in your daily lifeyou deal with, I'm not sure if that ever even came into my thinking. But I'm sure it's been on his mind for a long time about how that moment would actually happen. I was pleased to see that everyone was very supportive. And that he handled it extremely well. You're very brave. And it's good that you've done this. I kind of got the feeling he might be like that through his personality... ...and certain things that happened over the year. He would stay in his room and didn't like to hang out with us. Now that I know, it doesn't change anything. I still feel the same way about him. He's my bro. And... I'm not going to treat him any different. He's been your roommate? Yes. -He's so tall. -You guys... -Yeah. -I didn't know that. [Uter] I'm from Congo in Africa. And my first friend when I got here was Terrence. He showed me everything. Being from Africa, I cannot have a gay friend. I don't know about it. When I heard it, I felt like Terrence hurt me. Then you see all your past with him... It was good, he was always good. Something came in my mind said, like, &quot;It's okay, it's not a big deal.&quot; I've been to Florida and North Carolina and now I'm here, but Terrence is like my friend in Africa. It was emotional, for a minute I got to let down my guard and not be in game face mode. It was just being authentic. It wasn't me being... Terrence the character. It was me, Terrence, the young man, the person, standing there in front of them, expressing how I felt. I know everything you're going through. Thirty years later... You'll make it. I knew the story would touch her because of something that she deals with in her life. She's gay and she understands the struggle. And those are the responses that meanthe most to me. He just changed my outlook on people, you know? You can't judge a book by the cover, you know? And that's just Terrence. [Grover] I don't believe that he will be remembered for &quot;He came out.&quot; I think as people look back, they're just going to look at a stable, very outgoing kid who got to know a lot of different people. And people enjoyed their experienceswith him. I think that's how they're going to remember him. There's so much more than just his sexuality. That's just one small element to him. [people clapping and cheering] [annnouncer] Welcome one more time, ladies and gentlemen... [announcer continues indistinctly] Fighting is 90 percent mental. If you don't have the support, you feel like you can't accomplish anything. [people cheering] He's the champ. Ain't nobody like him. Let's go. Elbow. Elbow. Nice. Come on, Fallon. Come on, Fallon. Come on, Fallon. Come on! Very good! Nice, nice. [cheering] [announcer] Fallon &quot;Queen Of Swords&quot; Fox. [Fox] That was the question in my mind, when I first stepped out to fight Ericka Newsome. Was this going to be the last time that people cheered and looked at me positively? That questioned was answered tonight. And I totally didn't expect Taylorto show up either. And she was right there. It meant the world to me. [Taylor] She's kind of overcoming what happenedfor the last fight and I think it was nice to have people supporting her. And I think, it was just... just making it up to this point and being able to pull through with everything, it's just... I'm proud of her. Nice work. Great job. -Congratulations. -[chuckles] So, I'm going to say it. I want one. I think she's a pioneer for almost anything. Just being a single mom. Anything going through to be a fighter. To do the struggles. I feel that she will be a pioneer in the women's league. There are a lot of people that go through different struggles, there's always that one that sticks out. And honestly, Fallon sticks out. She has the guidance to be something, and she touches a lot of people. [Fox] No matter what happened, if people look at me negatively in one crowd, I always have another crowd someplace somewhere. Even if I'm out there fighting and the whole crowd is booing against me, I know there's some people in the world who support me. And they're not gay. They're not trans. They're not bi. They are just everyone else. [laughing] No, I'm not putting hat on right now. Why not? For the picture... Exactly. No, let's take it for the first one. Momma want to have a picture. [laughing] [cheering] From Los Angeles, California, Terrence Clemens. [students cheering] Terrence is a survivor. -He can make it. -And he gets that from his mama. -Because I'm a soldier. -No. No, Terrence is not like his mama, okay. This one here... Thank you, sir. Can we get everybody? [Clemens] It's a great feeling just to be ableto be myself and not worry anymore. The people that I love and I care about and I deal with day to day, they know and they accept me. And there was nothing different. They all congratulated me before I walked, and some of them even cried. It feels good. I guess I can say that the journey is not complete. Right now, this is an accomplishment. This is something to check off of my list. There are other things after that I want to continue to do and I'm just ready to go. -How's it goingan? -Good, good. -How's it going, man? -Good.
