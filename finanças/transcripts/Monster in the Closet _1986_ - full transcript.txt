[music playing] NARRATOR: The most mysterious, unexplainable, and inexplicable events often takes place in the most ordinary places, places like the small quiet college town of Chestnut Hills. Usually these seemingly unexplainable occurrences are eventually explained, but every so often they remain mysteriously inexplicable. Sometimes it is best to accept the unexplainable rather than search in vain for inexplicable explanations, for some things are simply unexplainable. The movie you are about to see is one of them. [screaming] [monster growling] [screaming] Here doggie, doggie. Can't fool me, Garbanzo, no sirree, not old Joe. I know every one of your hiding places. [thud] Ha! Gave yourself away, old girl. Old Joe may not be able to see worth a hoot in hell. I can hear an ant piss on a sponge. Yes, sirree. Ah, gotcha. [dog barking] Here, Garbanzo. Here, doggie, doggie. Here, doggie, doggie. Now be a good doggie and bring old Joe his slippers. Here, doggie, doggie. Now where do you suppose that old dog could be? I don't suppose he could be-- dag blast that dog. Well, I'll get me own slippers. Dag nabbit, that dog will be the death of me. [screaming] [monster growling] CHILD: 21, 22, 100. Ready or not, here I come. [car horn honking] OK, knuckleheads. I hear ya. So come on out! [door creaking] [thud] OK. I hear ya. Come on out! Look, dummy. I said I heard you in there. Now come on out! [music playing] [screaming] [music playing] [trolley ringing] [crowd chattering] [phone ringing] Excuse me, Chief? Could I talk to you for-- Richard, how many times have I asked you not to call me chief? Sorry, Mr. Bernstein. Ben. My name is Ben. Now you've been here for almost a year, for Christ's sake. Everybody calls me Ben. Hey, Scoop. Hey, Cliff. How you doing? Hey, Vinny, Great story, Scoop. [laughter] Scoop, that the best thing you've ever done. You're going to win another Pulitzer. Oh, that's sweet, Maggie. Am I going to see you tonight? Call me later. It's not the big story in a scoop that keep a big city newspaper alive day in and day out. It's the little things, Richard. What you right, that's what's important. That's what makes this paper click. The obituaries? [inaudible]. It's just a challenge [inaudible]. Hey, Chief. Scoop, baby, what a great story. Yeah. Hey, sit down. I'll be with you in a minute. Hi, Scoop. Hey, Dickie Boy. How you doing? We were just talking about the possibility of a more important assignment for Richard. Yeah? [laughs] Well, hey, that, uh, that sounds great. It's just that I know I could get the big story if I just had the right assignment. Maybe something political. Something with a little meat to it. BEN: I'm sure you could, Richard. RICHARD: I know I don't have any real training as a reporter. Of course, the only reason I got this job in the first place it because-- BEN: Richard, it's nobody's business how you got the job. I just don't think-- Wait a second, Chief. You know, Dick's got a point here. Well, he never does get a chance. He always gets the garbage. [laughs] While guys like me get to pick the plums. Chief, what do you say we, uh, we give the guy a shot? What'd you have in mind, Scoop? Here, Dick. He can, uh, he can have my next assignment. No, Scoop. Come on. I can't. I can't-- Big murder case up in Chestnut Hills. RICHARD: Murder case? Well, Dick, three murders within a week. Each body found with two mysterious puncture marks on it. Now this is not just another small town murder, Dick. Well, it's a, it's a conspiracy. Right, Chief? I'm beginning to think so. This could be the hottest story in the country. And no other major paper's picked up on it yet. It's all yours, Dick. And you'd let me have your story? Take it before I change my mind. Chief? Well, I suppose we could get Hoffman to do the obituaries for a week or two. OK, kid. Run with it. Tssh. Gah. [laughs] SCOOP: That story's three weeks old. [laughs] Chief [inaudible]. [music playing] [police radio] [phone ringing] PROFESSOR: Hold it a second, will you, Mister? OK. Go ahead now. You want me to do it again? Sure. [phone ringing] So what are you doing anyway? I'm just recording lots of different sounds. It's for a project I'm working on at school. Here. I guess this one's yours. Oh no. Thanks anyways. I'm not allowed to eat chocolate. [phone ringing] See? You're still alive. What's this project you're working on all about anyway? Have you ever heard of a ultrasonic energy augmenter? Ultrasonic energy augmenter? No, I don't believe I have. If it works it could be the answer to our whole energy problem. Thanks for your help, Ms. Bennett. [phone ringing] I'll be sure to take all this into consideration. Look, I realize how crazy it all sounds, Sheriff, but I really think you should-- Professor? What is going on? Uh, excuse me. I'm afraid it's y fault. I told him you wouldn't mind if he had just one little bite. I thought-- Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think you had no business telling him that. What's wrong with a little chocolate? What's wrong with a little chocolate? A, it's bad for your teeth. B, it's bad for your skin. C, it's bad for your whole body. And I could go down the whole alphabet if I had the time. Now it's fine with me if you want to poison your own children, but in the future will you do me a favor? Stay away from mine. What are you doing? [inaudible]. Who was that? Some crazy lady from the college. She thinks there's some kind of a snake that's doing the murders. You the guy from the newspaper? Yes, Richard Clark. Sam Ketchum. Come on in. Did you say snake? I told you she's crazy. Have you seen these pictures? Them two marks were found on each one of bodies. Probably a ice pick or some other kind of sharp instrument. Now that lady, Ms. Bennett, she teaches biology or something over at the university. She come in here and said to me that them holes was probably made by some kind of a giant snake. [laughs] Well, I've dealt with some kooks in my time, but that takes the cake. For heaven sakes, them two holes is over an inch wide apiece. Does that sound like any snake you ever seen? [spit pinging] No. Wasn't no snake that dragged Mary Lou Caldwell 15 feet across the room. Wasn't no snake that picked up Joe Shempter's dog and hung it on the closet door. No, sir, Mr. Clark. We ain't talking about not snake here. [spit pinging] What We got here is a homicidal maniac. He's bound to screw up sooner or later. And when he does, we'll be there. [inaudible] Waiting him out. This is where Mary Lou got it. I'll show you where we found her. RICHARD: Does there seem to be any theory or explanation about the closets? SAM: Nope, but we're working on it. Just a matter of time until we figure it out. I got my boys working double shift now. Just a matter of who and how. We'll get that sucker. [music playing] Hi, hon. Roy, what are you doing home so early? I finished work at the office, so I took off. Great. I'll be out in a few minutes. Hon, I'm going to run down to the store. Do you need anything? We can use a quart of milk. OK. I'll be back in about 15 minutes. [music playing] What are you doing, Roy? I thought you were going shopping, honey? Change your mind? What's wrong, Roy? Roy! What are you doing? I can't find my keys to the car. Can I borrow yours? Sure. They're in my red purse. Where is it? Top shelf in the closet. Thanks, hon. [music playing] [screaming] [monster growling] [screaming] Do you hear that? Sounds like it came from outside. [spit pinging] It killed my husband! It's in the closet! All right. All right. What's going on here? It was big and brown and [inaudible]. Pull yourself together, lady. Anybody know what she's talking about? She ran out of this building screaming, somebody killed my husband. Shower. She said a monster did it. Well, somebody take her inside and throw a glass of water in her face. -[inaudible]. Better stay back, son. Ooh-wee what a mess. Ick. I don't know about no monster or nothing, but that lady's right about one thing. This guy's dead as a door nail. Hi. I suppose you've come here to poison all my students now. Look, no chocolate. Just because you're an unarmed doesn't mean you're not dangerous. Look, I'm sorry about this afternoon, but I've gotta talk to you. It's about the murders. Who are you? I'm from the San Francisco Daily Globe. Richard Clark. Sheriff Ketchum told me about a theory that you have about a snake that's been committing the murders. That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. Do I look like a complete imbecile? If the sheriff had bothered to listen he would know that I was only trying to tell him that the marks found on the bodies had the same characteristics as a snakebite. I don't know what it means. I'm not a detective. But I certainly wasn't suggesting that some wild snake has been running around murdering people. There was another murder today. Oh no. I saw the body. It had the same two marks and I also found something. Diane? Diane? Have you seen my maxillary [inaudible]? I had it two minutes ago. And I can't even remember where I was. Mr. Mergis. No, Dr. Pennyworth. This is Mr. Clark. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. But you're coming to dinner at Diane's tonight? Mr. Clark has brought us something very interesting. I think you should take a look at this. Oh. That's strange. Do you feel the heat? Yes. Yes. Hard, isn't it? It seems to be some sort of animal claw. Never seen anything like it before. Diane, Diane, I'd, I'd like to run some tests on this at once. Oh, if that's all right with you? Sure. When do you think you'd have the results? Well, I, I might know something this evening. But since you're coming to Diane's house for dinner-- Oh, I'm sure Mr. Clark has probably made plans already. No, actually I don't have any plans. Can I take Mr. Clark upstairs now, Mother? Not now, Professor. Why not? A, we have other guests. B, we haven't had dessert. And C, I'm sure Mr. Clark would like some time to finish his eggplant. You're too kind. No, really. Now, now, now. If you don't clean your plate, no cucumber pudding. Look, a cockroach. I'll get it. Wait, Professor. Stop and think for a moment. Remember, even a cockroach is one of god's creatures. Oh, that's right. Why, there's so much you can learn from even the tiniest of insects. Now if you capture that cockroach, why, you may end up with a scientific specimen that you can dissect and study. But if you merely squash it on the table, well, then all you've got in the end is garbage. You're missing the point, Phillip. No matter whether you squash it, dissect it, burn it, or eat it, it's still the same thing. You're violating god's sixth commandment. Martin, when I was a young boy I found a little frog. I decided I would study it. So I cut it open and looked inside. Oh, there were bowels, intestines, all the usual things. But when I happened to squeeze one mucous membrane a slimy green substance squirted out right into my face. It was not unlike the color of a rancid avocado. I took one drop of this substance and studied it under a microscope. And from my study of that one drop there emerged my later discovery of a cure for cholera, which has saved millions and millions of lives. FATHER: That's precisely the point, Phillip. If we continue to slaughter defenseless creatures we are no better than the animals themselves. PHILLIP: You would have us stay, then, in the Middle Ages. And if I were to believe-- FATHER: Diane? Diane, are you all right? Oh, uh, yeah. I was just thinking. Um, Professor, why don't you take Mr. Clark upstairs right now, OK? Would you like to see it now? Boy, that would be great. I hate cucumber pudding. So do I. Well, this is it. So this is the famous ultrasonic energy augmenter, huh? Here. I'll show you how it works. But first you have to record some sounds. The augmenter will bounce the sounds back 1,000 times their normal energy. Now all we have to do is-- [yelling] Come on. [yelling] [police sirens] [inaudible]. Something terrible [inaudible]. It's in the house! It came out of the closet and tried to get Jimmy! -What did? -A monster! It was horrible! [inaudible] you stay here. BOY: I want to see. DIANE: No. [inaudible]. Freddie, come on inside. Looks like we gonna catch us a little monster here tonight. DIANE: Sheriff Ketchum, Sheriff Ketchum, wait. You don't know what might be in there. I know what's in there all right. What is in there is some giant brown snake and I'm fixing to go in and skin it. Ben, Barney, get the door. She could be right. [inaudible]. Sheriff [inaudible]. (ON MEGAPHONE): OK. We know you're in there, so come on out. You've got 30 seconds to get out here with your hands up. Now you've got 15 seconds to come out with your hands up. If you don't come our here, we're going to come in and get you. [monster growling] Everybody hold your fire. [monster growling] [screaming] OK, friend. Trick or treat's over. Now you stop right there and take that costume off. [monster growling] It's incredible. [monster growling] OK, buddy. That's far enough. You take one more step and I'm going to shoot. [monster growling] [gun firing] [screaming] [monster grunting] [yelling] [guns firing] Let's get outta here! Chestnut Hill police calling. We've got a 999 on McAllister Street. Some sort of a monster. [guns firing] [monster growling] Where do you think you're going? I've got to find out where it's going. Now, now stay back. Stay back. [police sirens] DIANE: It's gone. What was it? Something no human being had ever set eyes on before. You wanted a story, Mr. Clark. Oh, you may just have the biggest story the world has ever known. I only pray there's someone left to read about it. [music playing] MAN: Extra, extra, read all about it. Hey, get your morning paper here. Monster loose in Chestnut Hills. President declares national emergency. WOMAN (ON TV): While troops, army divisions, and reserve units rolled into Chestnut Hills, this small town 50 miles north of San Francisco, has become the focus of the entire world. General Franklin D. Turnbull head of army operations, issued a statement saying that the monster is-- Somewhere in this three block area. We've got it completely evacuated, roped off, patrol guarded, and surrounded by tanks. Now if the SOB's in there there's no way in hell he's going to get out. [chatter] General Turnbull, will you be going in after the monster or will you wait for it to come out? We think that there's a pattern to its movements. If we can figure out precisely what they are and where the thing is, we're going to go in and nail that sucker. Excuse me, General,-- What are you going to do with it when you find it, General? Pick my teeth with it. Any more bright questions? Uh, yes. General Turnbull, do you have any idea what this thing really is or where it came from? GENERAL: Personally, I don't give a damn. This is Dr. Pennyfeather's problem. I, I believe that it's a creature from another world, another time, possibly another planet. But the implications are staggering. That's why I hope to study it so that we can answer all of your questions. Dr. Pennyworth, do you have any theory as to why the monster is using closets to hide in? None. None whatsoever. That's one of the delightful mysteries of this whole phenomenon. MAN: General Turnbull, does this mean you're going to try to capture the monster alive rather than destroying it? I was sent here to save same lives, not to conduct scientific hodge podge. The minute we spot this bastard we're going to send him to kingdom come. Oh, but, General, General, there, there are no ground rules. I mean, sometimes you can save more lives by not pulling the trigger. Why, when I was a young boy I, I once found a frog. Now I could easily have taken that-- Excuse me, gentlemen, but we are wasting time here. We have a lot to do. We're wasting time talking. If everyone will just do exactly what they're told, stay out of this restricted area, and padlock your closets, the United States Army will take care of the rest. Thank you and good day. [chatter] Scoop? Hey, Dickie Boy. What are you still doing here? What do you mean? Well, didn't the chief get in touch with you? -No. -Oh, damn. I guess he forgot to call. Hey, Dick, you're in luck. You got a promotion. A promotion? Yeah. You know the political assignment you wanted? Well, you got it. Yeah, the chief wants you back at the office right away. But I can't leave. I'm right here in the middle of probably the biggest story I've ever-- Hey, Dick, it's all right. I'll cover for you. Look it, this monster crap's going to blow over in a day or two. Chief's got bigger things planned for you. Yeah, but still. I mean,-- Hey, you don't have to thank me, pal. I know you'd do the very same thing for me. Listen, Dick. I gotta go. I'll see you back in the office in a couple of days, huh? Hey, Dick? Congratulations. [music playing] SCOOP: Come on. Why not? DIANE: A, we're just about to have some tea. B, Dr. Pennyworth doesn't want to see anyone right now. And C, we've already told Mr. Clark everything we know. Mr. Clark? [laughs] Well, that's a hot one. Hey, listen, that idiot couldn't write his way out of a toilet stall. Yeah, anyway, he's not even on this story anymore. DIANE: What are you talking about? SCOOP: Listen, that guy's no reporter. You know how he got the job? His uncle owns the newspaper. That's how. [laughs] Yeah. The only reason we sent him up here in the first place was to get him out of everybody's hair. The guy's a loser. I mean, he's the laughingstock of the whole paper. Thank you very much for all this valuable information, Mr. Johnson. But I think you'd better go now. Yeah, look, I just need a couple of minutes with the old boy to get a couple-- DIANE: That old boy happens have won two Nobel prizes. And I really think you'd better go now. Thank you very much, Mr. Johnson. Look, I'm going to talk to him one way or the other. So you may as well let me talk to him right now. DIANE: Nice meeting you, Mr. Johnson. Bitch. [car tires screech] Mr. Clark? Hi. Hi. I just stopped by to thank you for dinner and to say goodbye. Are those for me? Oh. Yeah. I, I picked them up. They look like they can use some water. And you look like you could use some ice tea. Come on in. It's hot today, isn't it? It sure is. Why don't you relax in the living room? I'll be right there. PHILLIP: It was immortality. [sounds on recorder] FATHER: I'm afraid you're not getting the point. It's still one of god's creatures. And I'm not arguing with you. I'm merely trying to point-- ah. Mr. Clark. -Dr. Pennyworth. -Richard. PHILLIP: Sit down. Sit down. Martin, I don't want to kill it. I simply want to communicate with it. FATHER: Well, they're hardly giving it a chance. DIANE: Hardly giving it a chance, my god, it's killed five people already. I mean, don't you think that-- PHILLIP: Oh, that poor creature's more afraid than we are. Well, any wild animal will kill if attacked. But if we could communicate with it, reach out, make it understand that what we mean it no harm, why, why we could unravel mysteries that have plagued mankind for billions and billions-- Mr. Bennett? Ms. Bennett? [thud] Here. Are you all right, Diane? Yes. I, I was just-- [monster growling on recording] Stop. Professor. Professor, stop that thing. What's the matter? That, that sound. That sound, what was it? Which one? You mean the monster? Play it, play it back again. [monster growling on recording] [mumbling] Play it again. [monster growling on recording] [humming and mumbling] [humming] Good lord. Why didn't I think of this before? I believe we've just found the key. [music playing] [playing keys] [thud] [door creaking] [playing keys] [thud] [screaming] I told you I'd talk to him one way or another. [laughs] All right, Mr. Johnson. What would you like to know? Well, first off, Dr. Pennyworth, um, what's the angle on, uh, trying to communicate with this thing? It's one of god's creatures, my son. A stranger in a strange land. And it really hasn't been given a fair chance. We're talking about the far advanced being from another world, possibly a superior in relation to us as we are to the worms and lizards from which we evolved billions of years ago. Now if only we can communicate with it, well, we should be able to-- [music playing] [playing keys] [rattling sounds] [playing keys] [music playing] [screaming] [cat meowing] Diane, Diane, what was it? Just a cat. [thud] [playing keys] [door creaking] [playing keys] [screaming] All right. Everybody put their hands up. You're all under arrest. Who the hell do you think you are? That goddamn Junior G Men? Shit. Busting my ass trying to save some lives around here. And you people are out playing hide and seek with Godzilla. You know, General, there's more than one way to save lives. Why, when I was a young boy I, I once found a frog. Now I could've taken that frog and-- Frogs? What do I give a ding dong about frogs? For Christ's sake, get back in the ball game, Penny Finger. Do you have any idea what in hell is going on here? We are no longer in the kiddie leagues, gentlemen. There are reports of widespread panic. Boston, New York, Chicago, St. Paul, Duluth. General, I think we've got it. -There's a pattern? -Definitely. I knew it. The monster seems to move in half semi-circles alternating between 45 degrees south and 37 degrees northwest every 9 and 1/2 hours at a distance of 3 3/4 kilometers. What the hell does that mean? According to our calculations, excuse me, sir, the monster should show up here just about now. That's that god damn grammar school. TOGETHER: The Professor. [music playing] [screaming] Jesus! DIANE: Oh my god! Let me go! Let me go! Stay back! [screaming] [gun firing] Shoot it! Somebody help! Get back, you idiot! [inaudible]. Somebody help me! DIANE: Oh my god! PROFESSOR: Help me, someone! [inaudible]. DIANE: [inaudible] Not the closet! It's taking him to the closet! Tear his claw! Tear it off! [yelling] Don't let him get me! Help me, Mr. Clark! DIANE: Rip his shirt off! [inaudible]. Rip his shirt off! Help me! You fools, help him! He's going for the shirt. [monster growling] Look out! [monster growling] Let's get the hell outta here. [inaudible] Seal off this perimeter. Let's get the hell outta here. Cordon off this place. Bring out the tanks. Call in the artillery. [inaudible] Bring up the tanks. Somebody bring me a walkie talkie. [sirens blaring] All right. Now listen to me. Don't do anything until I give the orders. What, what, what's happening? God damn thing's coming out. All right, men. Get ready. -No. No. Wait, General. Wait. Please, just, just let me communicate with it before you do anything. [monster growling] All right, men. This is it. Let's show this bastard what we're made of. No, General. No. Don't, don't you understand? Don't you understand? We must find out. We must learn. We, we owe it to the future, to our children. And our children's children-- Oh, get away from me, you old goat. All right, men. Stand by. At my command. [interposing voices] Penny Finger, you old fool! Get back here! [monster growling] [playing keys] God dammit. Listen. I'm your friend. You, you must understand me. I want to help you. I'm a scientist. [playing keys] [monster growling] [playing keys] [music playing] OK, boys. Let's send this bastard back where it came from. [explosion] [guns firing] [monster growling] Everybody out! Everybody out! Evacuate the area! [sirens blaring] [monster growling] Diane? I'm here, Dr. Pennyworth. We, we did it. Yes, we did it, Dr. Pennyworth. We, we communicated. Yes. We really communicated. You really did it, Dr. Pennyworth. Congratulations, Dr. Pennyworth. Oh, I knew. I, I knew we could do it. We communicated. Dr. Pennyworth, could you understand what it said? No. We must stop it. We must. We must. It, it can't be stopped. Only one way. Only one thing can stop it. What? What can stop it, Dr. Pennyworth? We mus destroy. Destroy what? Destroy all. We, we must destroy, we must destroy all, all frogs. Frogs. Why, I see frogs everywhere. Millions and millions of frogs. It's so beautiful. Frogs everywhere. [music playing] WOMAN: Extra, extra. Read about the monster. 24 hours to evacuate. Extra, extra. REPORTER: Army and National Guard units have joined together here today to facilitate the evacuation of Chestnut Hills. Authorities at the scene have expressed amazement at the relative calm of the citizens here in what could easily have been a panic situation. Area residents are hastily boarding the caravan of buses, which will ultimately take them to the emergency shelters that have been set up in San Francisco. The immediate future of those involved in this mass exodus is uncertain as people grab whatever possessions they can carry. In less than 24 hours the only thing remaining in this empty ghost town will be the strange, seemingly indestructible creature that lurks in a closet. After that if any-- here's General Franklin Turnbull, head of Army operations, who may be able to give us some further information. General Turnbull, once the town has been safely evacuated, what do you plan to do next? You tell me. I don't know how to stop the son of a bitch. Put a god damn protective shield or something around. What? What? I don't give a holy who how if we're on television. By next week there may be no television. Shit. Our guns, our tanks, our bombs, our nuclear missiles, they're all like toys against this thing. Let me tell you something. If it makes a move against our major cities, it's going to be all-- WOMAN (ON TV): As the president called an emergency session of Congress. So far there has been no explanation as to what this thing is-- MAN (ON TV): Where it came from or how it got here. What we do know is that no weapon known to mankind has been able to stop it. The United Nations has formed a special commission to discuss the threat this creature poses to world safety, but as of right now nobody seems to have any idea how to stop this thing. Folks, I, I think it's time to say a prayer, a prayer for the whole world. FATHER: And bless the soul, oh, heavenly father, of he who died that others might live. He who valued life over death, yet also valued death over life. Life over death because he was a man who sincerely believed in his heart that it was better to be alive than dead. And death over life because he knew in his inner most soul that it was better to die for life than to live for death. Hey, what are you guys doing here? Don't you know the whole town's evacuating? I hate to bother you at a time like this, Ms. Bennett, but, uh, I got a couple of questions I'd like to ask you. Not now, Mr. Johnson. Please. Uncle Martin? I don't think god would mind if we finish the services in San Francisco. Amen. Uh, Ms. Bennett, um, just before Dr. Pennyworth died he, he said something about a way to stop the monster. Do you have any idea what he was talking about? Scoop, this, this really isn't-- Hey, don't worry about it, Dick. It's OK. Um, yeah. He said, we must destroy all. All something, but he never finished. Do you have any idea what he meant? Destroy all what? I wish I knew. Well, you must. I mean, you're the only one who-- She said she doesn't know. Hey, [laughs] hey, don't get touchy, Dickie Boy. Lookit, I wasn't suggesting that she did know, or that maybe she was saving that information for somebody else, so that somebody else could get himself an exclusive story. [laughs] Hey, listen, hon, I just need-- And don't call her hon. Hey, listen, Clark. If you and this bitch think you're gonna-- [punching sound] PROFESSOR: Is he all right, Uncle Martin? FATHER: I'm sure he will be, my son. God moves in mysterious ways. I'd like to think that in his infinite wisdom god dimmed Mr. Johnson's lights so that in the darkness the lord could get his attention. And he'll come back a better, and a wiser human being. Amen. PROFESSOR: Boy, Mr. Clark knocked him out with one punch. FATHER: It was not Mr. Clark, my son. It was the punch of god. PROFESSOR: Gee, Mr. Clark. You knocked him out with one punch. I did? Boy, you were right. Crunch bars really do give you lots of energy. Energy. That's what Dr. Pennyworth was talking about. The only way to stop the monster. We must destroy all its energy. MAN: Area residents are advised to undertake the following evacuation procedures. Do not load yourself down with unnecessary items. I wanna stay with you, Mother. MAN: And other essential supplies will be provided for you at the emergency relocation facilitates and shelters, which have been set up in San Fransisco. Secure your homes-- General Turnbull? There's a bus. See what arrangements you can make while I talk to the general. I don't wanna go on the bus. DIANE: General, [inaudible] talk to you. I think I know how to stop the monster. Uh huh. Electricity. Oh, yeah. Plug it into a socket, turns itself into a Christmas tree. No. We did some tests. Dr. Pennyworth and I, on one of the monster's claws. Dr. Pennyworth? And found that the cell structure consisted of electrons. --[inaudible] playing with a broken helmet. --[inaudible] millions and millions of times faster than normal. I don't give a monkey's fart how fast [inaudible]. General, just listen. No, you listen. There's no way in hell we're can stop this thing. Just listen. The electrons move so fast they create a heat-- Tried everything already. [inaudible]. Nuclear bombs. There are two seats left. And they're ready to go. OK. I don't wanna go on the bus. That's not negotiable. I'll meet you in San Fransisco tomorrow. See you at the church. Let me stay with you. OK. I love you. Be good. Bye. Just in case you need some energy. We've gotta hurry. See you in San Fransisco, son. Will you listen to me? I'm telling you, we can destroy it with electricity. And I'm telling you I don't care how long an extension cord you got, there ain't no way. But I'm trying to tell, we can destroy its energy if we can just pump enough voltage into it-- The United States Army can't stop this thing. How the hell are you gonna? [inaudible], get the hell outta there. Jesus Christ, lady. Face the music. It's the god damn end of the world. Know what that means? It means every man for himself. I don't know about you, but I'm gonna get the hell outta here. [engine roaring] I'm staying. I know. MAN: And other essential supplies will be provided for you at the emergency relocation facilities [inaudible]. Better get going. I'm staying, too. You don't understand. Yes, I do. You're gonna try to kill the monster. It's gonna be dangerous. And I'm gonna help you. Richard, really, I appreciate-- You're not gonna talk me out of it. Why are you doing this? Look at it this way. A, if it doesn't work, what's the difference? It's the end of the world anyway. B, if we do succeed, well, hen I end up with the greatest scoop of all time. And C? Tell you about that some other time. Come on. We'd better hide. [music playing] [explosion] [playing keys] [thunder rolling] [playing keys] [thunder rolling] [monster growling] It's coming. [playing keys] Look, I, um, I don't know what's gonna happen or how much time we've got. But I never got a chance to say thank you. Thanks for saving the professor and, oh, for everything. [playing keys] Will you do me a favor? Sure. Tell me what C was. C was that I wanted to be with you. You know, the first time I knew I liked you? It wasn't when you stood up for me against Scoop. Huh? It was before that. It was even before you saved the professor. It was the day, the day you came to say goodbye. [laughs] I still picture you standing there with those flowers in your hand. You looked so-- [screaming] We've gotta move the trap! [monster growling] [inaudible] Kick harder. [monster growling] Get the box. [monster growling] [inaudible] He's moving too far to the left! Move! [shattering] [monster growling] Now. [monster growling] [explosion] [monster growling] The attic. Professor! God, what are you doing here? It's coming. I'm almost finished. Just one more screw. What are you talking about? The energy augmenter. I could stop it with the energy augmenter . It's a toy. It won't do-- [monster growling] Oh my god. Mother, trust me. I know it will work. -This is crazy. You can't possibly-- Let him try. It's our only chance. [monster growling] The horn! We need the horn! Get back here! [inaudible]. We gotta make the head come out. We gotta make it [inaudible]. [monster growling] It'll kill itself in its own [inaudible]. It won't work! [monster growling] PROFESSOR: Please! [electronic sounds] [blowing horn] [monster growling] Again! [blowing horn] [monster growling] [explosion] DIANE: Oh god. Uh oh. [monster growling] [music playing] Mother. They're gone. Richard. It's no use. It's all over. Nothing can stop it. It's the end, Professor. Mother, what if Dr. Pennyworth didn't mean that we should destroy all its energy? What if he was trying to tell us that the only way to stop the monster was to destroy all closets? [music playing] REPORTER: Panic and mass hysteria spread throughout the world today as the unstoppable closet creature continues its relentless march southward. Virtually all of northern California from Crescent City to San Fransisco has been evacuated. And at the same time, emergency procedures are underway throughout the western half of the United States. Religious leaders and scientists alike are predicting the worst. The possible end of civilization as we know it. Countless millions everywhere are fleeing from the death and destruction that lie ahead. But where do we run? Where do we hide? I'm afraid we may be witness to a biblical prophesy come true. And the beasts shall inherit the earth. We now switch you to an emergency broadcast from Professor Diane Bennett out of the University of Chestnut Hills. Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you with the last hope, the last hope for humanity, the last hope for mankind. We've tried every reasonable and rational approach, but neither man nor machine has been able to stop this thing. I ask you to bear with me for a moment and throw reason and rationale out the door. We have no idea what this creature is or where it came from, or how it got here. All we do know is that it moves from closet to closet. And that these closets serve some sort of purpose for this beast, possibly as places for shelter or security, for rejuvenating itself. Who knows? All we know is that our only hope of destroying this monster is to destroy its places of refuge, to destroy all closets. Go out and destroy every closet you can find, every closet in the world, whether you have to chop them down, burn them down, or blow them up, it's our last hope. I repeat, we must act immediately. Destroy all closets. [banging] [monster growling] MAN (ON RADIO): Carrying Richard Clark, the unfortunate newspaper reporter. They've been in there over 10 minutes now and there is still no apparent explanation as to why the monster, in its weakened condition, would go to the Transamerica building. [monster growling] Widespread speculation that there may be an undestroyed closet still remaining in the Transamerica building. If this is true, it would almost certainly represent the monster's last chance to rejuvenate itself. It's only hope for survival. [monster growling] The eyes and ears of the world are fixed upon one single building in San Francisco as mankind anxiously awaits word that will determine its final fate, word as to whether we are to live or die. [monster growling] Staggering out of the Transamerica building, Clark seems to be OK. But the monster is really in bad shape. Oh my god. It almost fell. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the creature is dying. Richard. [monster growling] Richard! I was so worried. We were all praying that-- PROFESSOR: Mr. Clark! Mr. Clark, we did it. The world is saved. What was it like, Mr. Clark? What did you and the monster do all that time? It could have saved itself. There was a closet. It couldn't fit both of us in. It could've saved itself. What an angle. Destroyed by its own closet. Oh no. It wasn't the closet. It was beauty killed the beast. Boys, that's enough already. OK. We'll read all about it in Mr. Clark's exclusive articles starting Monday in the Globe. Mr. Bernstein. Call me Chief. [chatter] NARRATOR: As the end came swiftly and the world was safe, it was improbable, unexplainable, a complete mystery. But this isn't the time for worry about explanations. It's a time for joy and celebration, a time to hold your loved ones and give thanks. Go home, my friends. Go back and re-build your closets. [music playing] Hi. [playing keys] OK, boys. [gun firing] [smashing] Dag blast. Hi, hon. [screaming] [monster growling] [music playing]
