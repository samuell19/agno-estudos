Subtitles by explosiveskull Once, long ago, in the deep blue below, there was a kingdom, a king, a queen, and six sisters, princesses of the sea. The ocean realm was theirs, and the princesses were free to go wherever they wished, except for one place. The Surface. Each princess on her 15th birthday was allowed to venture to the above, but only for one day. Finally, the time came. The littlest mermaid's 15th birthday. And what she saw above would alter her existence forever. A prince. A true love. When the prince fell the little mermaid found herself so drawn to him. Despite stories she had heard of the dangers above she had to save him. She lingered over the prince, gazing at him. She wondered what this feeling was. What would it be like to be with him? To actually have legs? She had never felt this way before. As another human approached, she gave the prince one last look before descending back into the sea. She watched from behind a rock as the prince awoke. He opened his eyes, thinking that the one who stood before him had saved his life. The little mermaid was so sad. She had left her heart above, and wondered if a mermaid could ever be with a human. She swam into the darkest depths of the sea where there lived a wizard. And she told the wizard of her love and her desperation for legs like those who lived above. The cunning wizard made her an offer. He said he would grant her a wish in exchange for one thing, her soul. But if she were to go above and not be able to find love, her soul would be his until true love came. The little mermaid agreed. The promise was forged, the bond made. But upon finding her prince she found his heart still belonged to the woman on the shore. The little mermaid was visited by the wizard who had come to collect on their agreement. She pleaded with the wizard, but it was too late. Above the sea the wizard would keep her locked away ensuring she would never find true love, and her power would be his forever. If I told you a secret, would you be able to keep it? Really, truly you would keep it? Yes, yes, I would keep my secret. Well, I don't remember the story exactly like that. Don't be silly, Grandmother, everybody knows there's no such thing as mermaids. You wouldn't say that if you had met one. You've met a mermaid? Yes. But you don't believe, so, so why should I tell you the story? You wanna hear it? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! This begins with a little, little girl. And she believed in mermaids and in fairies, and in leprechauns, and all magical creatures. And, her name was Elle. ♪ My fair lady Dear Dr. Malcolm. Thank you for your preliminary diagnosis of my niece, Elle. Life has been difficult following the loss of her parents Yet, somehow her spirits remain high, mostly due to her imaginative belief that she is somehow a mermaid, and that being the reason for her condition. But no doctor anywhere seems to know what truly ails her, and now that her breathing patterns worsen, I fear her life may be in danger. I will continue to search in hopes that one day the mystery behind her condition is revealed, and a cure is found. Breathe, breathe! Hopefully yours, Cam. Cam, hurry, it's Elle! It's OK, just breathe. Elle, it's OK, it's OK, I've got you. It's OK, it's OK, It's OK, you OK? You can't push yourself that hard, I've told you. I know. It's just that everybody else was... Playing? We're gonna find a cure, I promise. But until then you have to be more careful. Did you see that? What is it? Good morning, Mr. Harrison. Good morning, Margaret, any calls for me? They're on your desk. Good morning, young man! Good morning, sir. How's the story going? Great. Yeah. Well, I want it to stop, look, this just came in. I want it to take priority. It's a cure all sweeping the region. Water from Mississippi said to have healing powers. Really, healing water? We've followed stories like this before, wood witches, awoken mummies, they never lead anywhere. No, not like this, hundreds of people are testifying. But, I... But nothing! Alright, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, but there's definitely a story here. And possibly a cure for her. Look, Cam, I know it can't be easy coming from, how do you say, across the pond. It's already settled, travel and accommodations. Don't just sit there, get going, pack your bags. Thank you, sir. Oh, don't thank me, thank, Jimmy. Dr. Locke's Miracle Mermaid Elixir. Right. They're here, Elle! What's taking so long? We'll only be gone for a few weeks. I know you'll miss her, but it won't be for long. Do you promise? I promise. A long journey from home. Elle seems to have turned her intrepidness for our little adventure into joyful excitement. Seeing a smile on her face only makes me want to believe. My logical skepticism runs high on this Dr. Locke and his magic mermaid water. If only life were as simple as a made up fairy tale. 88 Wood Street. This must be it. Welcome to Mississippi! Oh, let me help you with that. Oh, let me take this, take this from ya. Cameron it is, right? Journalistically speaking, yes, but you can call me Cam. And who's this little darling? I'm Elle.

You're welcome, be kinda nice to have some company. Why, I think we're going to like it here, Elle. Oh, I forgot, I haven't shown you guys the garden. Even has a treehouse. Elle! Elle! Elle, be careful! Wow! Isn't this kingdom beautiful? A princess should be more careful. C'mon here. Peggy Gene! Cam, I want you to meet Peggy Gene. Hi! Peggy Gene's one of my closest friends! It's very nice to meet you, Peggy Gene. And it's very, very nice to meet you too. Oh, and who's this little nugget? I'm Elle. Elle, aren't you the sweetest little apricot in the land! Look at you, those little cheeks and you're so cute. You're like a bug in a rug! You have to excuse Peggy Gene Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't been around many people lately. But ever since that healing water fixed my leg, I'm just flittin' around like a little social butterfly. - Healing water? - Mm-hmm. I'd love to talk to you about that. Why sure, Lorene knows where to find me, but I will be at the church all day long and I will talk, talk, talk to you boo all about that healing water, and if you like I can invite some other people 'cause I understand you're making a story. Hey, Peggy Gene, Peggy Gene. I'll see you tomorrow at the church. Yes, yes, I'll see you tomorrow at the church, OK. See folks, I'll see you tomorrow. OK, now you take care now, alright. Come on let's get some of this nice fruit I told you about. Well, howdy Eugene! Howdy, Lorene! Ha, alright! Ms. Elle, you say you like them oranges. So you really do know everyone in town, huh? Pretty much. Well outside of those that are come here about that healing water. I understand that's why you did too. You ready? Let's go. Come on! Hello. Hi. What's your name? I'm Elle. Elle. Can you read mine? Of course, child. You are special in all the world. There's a powerful magic in you. A spirit of the ocean. You should keep these. Thank you. And what about you, you don't believe in all this magic, do you? I'm skeptical. Come, see! There is some magic that is real. And some that is illusion. Wow. Beware of the one who will try and take your most precious treasure. You must not let him. Well, the show is about to start. You don't want to miss this. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye! This place is very strange. Step right up, step right up! Come and witness the magic, witness the wonder! Ladies and Gentlemen, come one, come all, to the shop of art! Feast your eyes on that which you have never seen. It is said that they are pure myth, pure legend. But, my dear friends, let me introduce you to your dreams. Alive! Breathing and swimming! The Little Mermaid of the Mississippi! Elle, Elle. Elle! She was real. Just cheap tricks, Elle. There are no cheap parlor tricks here. Fairy Floss! One please. Thank you. The fairies worked really hard to make this! I'm sure they did. What? Sorry to bother you. I was just wondering if I could buy some... Can you read, sold out! What! It's just, sold out 'til when? 'Til further notice! Well, he was polite. Can I ride, please? I don't think you're big enough. Am so! Man, I'm 10 times stronger than the Strong Man! I mean, have you seen these? Bam, bam! Whoo, well! Well, look at this! I've never seen a freak so pretty! Oh, she isn't a freak, she's a fake! Whatever she is, she sure is sweet. Hey, leave her alone! What ya gonna do about it? Better take a step back! Pretty scared, boy! We'll take it from here. Did you see me, how high I got? Your such a big girl now. Come on, let's go. So, Elle believed the mermaid was real? She knew it was real. I know too. And what about Cam? Cam, like most grown-ups, needed more proof of the impossible. And that's the thing about what you believe. There's a whole other world out there to see. And Cam just had to figure that out. I still can't believe I saw an actual mermaid. She was so beautiful, and I know she was real. Can I see her again tomorrow? Can I meet her? Elle, we talked about that. What you saw was just a trick. You believe what you want, and I'll believe what I want. And I believe she was real, Alright, good night. Sleep well. Cam? Yes? I wish Mom and Dad could have seen her. Me too. But wait! How can the mermaid live if she's not in the sea? Have you ever heard of a Sea Lamprey? Well, it's a fish that can live in both river and sea. Let's you know that nothing's impossible. Especially here in Erie, Mississippi. It has that certain magic about it. That's a good one. You both are gonna enjoy that one. So, what happened after you drank the water? Well, I'm not crazy anymore. I was as deaf as can be before I drank the water. Have you been experiencing any side effects? I can do this. What happened after you drank the water? Well, I was having migraines, but now I just get headaches. It's real magic, I think. Ooh! Magic! Magic! Magic, huh? Believe it or not I was done near bald before I took the water. I never thought I'd find love again. Now I seem to love everyone. What do you think about the magician? Oh, I think he's wonderful. So dark and mysterious, and handsome too. I prefer the mermaid. Sorry, what, what was the question? Probability, hoax. Hello? Cam Harrison. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. Please, have a seat. Thank you. So, Mr. Locke, is it? Firstly, I want to ask you about the healing water. Can you tell me what it does for people? By now you must have asked my customers. What did they tell you? They have some unusual stories, yes, but... You do not believe. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Where is it from, how do you make it? The first rule of magic is to never reveal the How or the Why. But it's not magic is it? Surely if it works, there must be some medical formula. You do not believe, then why are you here? Apologies if I have offended you. I'm just writing for my readers. Let's try some other questions. Can you tell me about the mermaid? It appears your time is up, Cam Harrison, please. The blue fairy makes the blue flower. The pink fairy makes the pink flower. The white fairy makes the white flower. - And the Yellow Fairy - And the Yellow Fairy - makes the yellow flower. - Makes the yellow flower. Yes, I know, I know. We really shouldn't be out here much longer, Elle. I don't think it's a good idea. Lorene's gonna be looking for us and I, and I don't want to get stuck out in the middle of the woods. Wait, Elle! Hey, hey you! You're, you, you're the mermaid! I am. But how do have legs? Well, mermaids get their legs every low tide. But, ssh, it's a secret. I won't tell. You know where I come from we have a fairy tale about a little girl born on land blessed with the heart of a mermaid. Right, uh, what were you doing in the woods? Am I not allowed to go for a walk in the woods? - So, how... - What's your name? Elizabeth. I'm Elle. This is Cam, he's my uncle. Sorry, I have to go. See, I told you she was real. I told you, you do what I say! Stop! Stay outta this! Strike me then. As you wish, darling. Enough! That is enough for today. But I cannot promise what tomorrow may bring. As for you, do not meddle in my affairs. It's OK, girl. Why're you so afraid? It's OK. I don't know what she is, but she is special. What'd ya see? Something I haven't seen in a very long time. She may be the one we are searching for. What are we gonna do?

You? What are you doing here? I'm sorry. The place was closed, and I, um... You shouldn't be here, he knows everything. Who knows, what are you talking about? Cam Harrison. I just have some further questions about the show. About the healing water. I wish I could help you, truly I do, but we are closed. Now, if you do not mind. I really hope not to find you trespassing again. Stay away from her! Who is he, and who is she? It doesn't matter, you shouldn't be here. I know something strange is happening and whatever secret... Just go. Go. All aboard! Now, this here is the Pride of the Mississippi. Well, you heard what the man said, all aboard. I wonder if we'll see a mermaid in the river? Keep your eyes posted! You've got it, Captain! Well, while you two are mermaid watching, I'll be in the study doing some actual work. Whatever you say, First Mate. OK. Mermaids do not exist. What are you working on? Nothing, uh, it's just, just some story I... I like stories. I'm not sure that's such a good idea. Says you don't believe in mermaids. It's a work in progress. I wasn't really expecting someone to be, to be rummaging through my things. Well, you're the one who's always following me. You know, I'm surprised you're on this boat at all. But, then again, you must get tired of the water. Being an actual mermaid and all. Well, water is a part of me I guess, a part of us all. You know when I was little my mother would swim with me, deep into the ocean, further than most would go. I remember looking through the water and wondering what it must be like on the other side. Yeah. When I was born, my family would go to the beach every summer. I remember wishing we'd get caught in a whirlpool stuck in a time warp, and summer would just, just last forever. It's my favorite memory of us. Before Elle got sick, and the accident happened. Now I, I just want to keep her safe. My father was the same. She's special. She's strong. I'll try and remember that. She's all I have left. The reason I'm here, the healing water is, is it real? I believe in magic and a lot of things. Water being one of them. But not his. Not Locke's. The dance is starting! Elizabeth? Come, dance with me! Photo! All together. Peggy Gene, are you OK? Yeah, I simply got hurt. It fades. What does? The magic, it doesn't last. You be careful of that man, do you understand me? Don't you let him near the Apricot. She will rot! Don't you let that Apricot rot, do you understand me? Yeah. Come here! Here, let Cam show you. I'm afraid I'm not a very good dancer. Sorry, I'm sorry! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The moon, come. Why are you always staring at me like that? 'Cause I want to see you. Don't you want me to see you? It's not that, it's just a little, you know, intense. Well if you don't look then how do you see? How do you really see a person? We should be free to open our eyes and look. He can't take that away from us. Who can't, Locke, you mean? I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. You know you don't have to apologize all the time. You're right, I'm I'm sorry, I mean. Look, isn't it... Beautiful. Looks like the wheel is stuck. We'll have to wait for high tide. High tide? Yeah. I'm sorry, I have to go. Wait, Elizabeth. Elizabeth! You're afraid. They always are. You're... How can this be? You won't understand. I, I want to. It happened a long time ago. I was free. I lived with my family in the sea, I was tricked. He took a part of me and he has it still. So wherever he goes I must. We're bonded. Locke. For years he's taken me from town to town. Selling the water I swim in as healing water. So that's where he gets it, you. Yes, but you shouldn't get involved. I think it's too late for that. Why can't you just run away, escape him? Because we're connected. As long as he has part of me with him there's no escape. There has to be something, a way somehow. There is. What's wrong? It's Locke, he knows I'm here, he's summoning me. No, no, you can't go back to him. You don't understand, I have to, I'm his. No, no, Elizabeth! I'm sorry, Cam! So Cam believed now, right? He did, he had to believe what his eyes saw. Despite every logical bone in his body, he couldn't deny the truth. And, that kiss was still in his mind. But, there was much that he did not understand especially when it came to Locke. Oh, thank God, I've had half the town looking for you! Why, what happened? Well, I, I was wondering what, what happened to you and I left Elle in, in, in the room playing. What happened? - And then, and then when I... - Lorene, what happened? And then, when I went back... What happened, Lorene, what happened? She was gone and the window was opened! Where is she? I don't know. Why does he have you trapped in here? Did you do something wrong? No. He said I had the heart of a mermaid. And that was a powerful kind of magic. You do, I see it too. But be careful. He's not like you and I, he's a bad man. Do you understand? When I was young I was just like you. And when I'm older I want to be just like you. Oh, he's coming! It'll be ok, just remember what I said! OK. Let her go! I cannot. You see she is the one I've been searching for. You don't need her, you have me! You? I plan to rid you from this earth, and take your powers. Once and for all. Go, go, go, go, go, go find Elle! Elizabeth tells me you wish to be like her. Is this true? What if I could make it so? What if I could grant you any wish you so desire? In exchange for a simple thing. Anything? Anything you can dream of. You won't trick me. You're not like us. You just want to control everyone. In time you will find that I can be most persuasive. I know where she is. It's alright, come with me. I said you would come for me. We're gonna get you out of here. Where do they put the keys? The guard has them. Over there. It's alright, I'm gonna get you out of here, OK? It's sold out. OK, let's go. Locke knows Elizabeth told you. He won't stop coming, not now! We have to save her, we have to save Elizabeth. We will, Elle. She can't leave without her soul, if she does, she dies. Locke keeps it hidden somewhere safe. I don't know where it is. I think I know where that might be. Come on. That's it. Easy. He's with us. It's time. We can trust him. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce you to your dreams. We have to hurry, I can't hold it for very long. Wow! We have to hurry. I can't. How is it possible? It won't last long, it'll be high tide soon. OK. We must go. Wait. There's something we have to do. She's free, let's go. You OK? So what now? We have to get you to the ocean. How long do we have before time begins again? With Locke it's uncertain. Then we need to move. The train, should be a straight shot from the station. All our trains run towards the ocean, hurry! Cam, wait! Cam. I'm too old to be jumping on trains. I'd just hold you back. You're one of a kind, Lorene, thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Good luck, Cam, take good care of her. I will. The train is picking up pace, we have to hurry! We can make it! It's OK, here. Here. I think this belongs to you. Thank you. Thank you all. We had to do something. 17 years. He found me when I was young. Promised he could help me, help me not be so different. He promised me the same. Found me trying to block out all the world's thoughts and said that he could fix it. I just listened to him. There is nothing wrong with who you are. You must really miss your families. I'm glad you have this one. Come one, come all, let me introduce you to your dreams. Alive, breathing, swimming. The Little Mermaid of the Mississippi! Elizabeth! Ah! They have it, the soul! They're on a train headed for the ocean. Boys are going after 'em right now. Stop them! This time once and for all! You got it, Boss! They're here. Stay back! Elizabeth, look out. It's OK! We have to go! Now! There's a truck close by. There are no keys. We don't need keys. Stay with Elizabeth! Elle, Elle, it's OK, it's OK. It's OK, I've got the medication here. It's not here, stop, we left the medicine on the train! Come on, let's go. Elle, we're going, let's go! No, I'm staying, I'm staying! Come on, Elle, come on, let's go, come on! I'm staying, Elizabeth, she's my friend. Stop treating me like a little girl. I can make it further. Just trust me. This once. Alright, Elle. I trust you. We have to go. He's close. Keep moving, I'll take care of him! No, you can't! You don't have a choice, now go. Go! I've been waiting a long time for this. Man against monster. Who's which? There's nobody here to save you now. You neither! It's starting. We have to hurry, she's changing! Wow. We have to get her to the ocean. How much further? Just past the trees. We have to hurry! We're stuck. Can you carry her? Yeah. You need to get to the ocean. What about you? I can take care of our old friend here, buy you some time. I had such great hopes for you. Such a disappointment! You hoped that I would be cruel, like you. You know better than anyone that no two souls are the same. Indeed they aren't, one is always darker. You won't win this time. Let it be light versus night. There is no power greater than love. She's free, she doesn't belong to you! Nothing in this world is free, Cam Harrison. It's alright, it's alright, I won't let them take you. She's good, she's not like you! I won't let you have her! Take it. No, no. Locke's powers grow with it, so can yours. No, no, you're too weak. It's the only way. Her soul is mine! Pity they must now die! My powers are forever! Not you or anyone else on this planet can defeat me! I believe. What have they done to me? Magic. Now, he is a prisoner. Elizabeth? She needs water! It's alright, it's alright. The vial. Elizabeth, please. Come on! Elle, Elle? Elle, it's OK, your OK, take a breath, breathe! Ssh, ssh. You OK? Let me take her, water can heal her. You're OK. Ssh, ssh. You're OK. Thank you. Deep water is magic, just like her love. Whenever she can't breathe, all she need do is swim. I'll miss you. I see you found your story. Think anyone will believe it? All that matters is that you do. Come outside and play! All the fairies are out today, and they love mermaids. Then we mustn't keep them waiting. No! Come on! All that matters is that you do. And she gave him the biggest gift a person could ever give another, love. Now from that time on, no matter where he went she was with him, mm-hmm. Ah, that's another story, OK. What happened to Elle? Are you OK, Grandmother? Just time for a swim. How'd the story end? Let's go, I don't know. Come on, let's go see. Let's go, come on. - Grandmother? - Grandmother? Subtitles by explosiveskull
