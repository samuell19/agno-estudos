( grand, fun theme playing ) ( soft, calm theme playing ) ( hums ) Lackawanna 8-799. MAN: Hello. Hello. I'm so afraid to close my eyes ♪ Afraid that I'll find ♪ Ah, that was mighty pretty, honey. Oh, hello. Say, are you doing anything tomorrow after the matinee? No. Well, how would you like to get married? Well, you got someone in mind? Yes. Me. Well, best offer I had today. Suppose I think it over? All right, you take your time. I'll hold on. Okay. This lovely thrill ♪ Is just a silly illusion ♪ With my eyes wide open ♪ Do I deserve such a break? ♪ La da da da dee ♪ La da da-hee ♪ You know, I think I can make it. Good. Oh, uh, by the way, what was that name again? Miller. Bill Miller. Oh, how nice. Well, good night, Mr. Miller. Now, one minute. Who are you? Well, I'm Mary Turner. Good night, darling. See you in church. See you in church. Mighty pretty. Mighty pretty. Thank you, sir. The agent's slice, Leo. The usual ten percent. Looks like a small cut to me. Ha ha. Hello, Mary. Hi, honey. And to you and Mary, the best of luck, forever and a day. I'll miss you, Bill. I'm gonna miss you too, Ben. You've been swell. We had great years. Why the gloom, boys? This is a wedding, not a wake. ( chuckles ) For the act, it's a wake. Bill's leaving. Eh? Well, I wanna play the big time on my own, as a single. Oh, is that so? I tell you, you're out of your head, quitting a great comic like Ben Bailey. Well, I did a single before. I know a lot more now. I've learned from Ben. Listen, Bill, when I found you in Scranton, you were making a fast 60. You had those flashy two-pants suits and ragged underwear. Who got you to play that chest piano? Who built you up to 1250? Who bought you your first tuxedo? I did! Bill, the trick in show business is to be a hit. With another guy, with a girl, with a kangaroo, anything. Look, you're my friend, but I don't think you can make it alone. Now, don't try to talk me out of it, boys. I'm gonna start again in Scranton. Alone. If I have anything, I'll be back here again, alone. My name will be on top, alone. Maybe you should've got married, alone. I don't think you can stand two talented people in the same family. I'm sorry, fellas. I'm doing a single. A singing, dancing, talking comedian. I love you, Leo, but since an hour ago, I have a wife to take care of. I gotta start sometime. Okay. Start. Well, what do you say, Leo, do I make any sense? If you really mean what you just said, you make sense. I think any man has a right to do what he wants to... providing he doesn't hurt anyone. But you've got to have material, jokes. Well, I have Al Borden writing an act for me right now. He's the greatest gagman in America. You think so? I do. That makes two of you. You and Al. Now, look, Leo, will you leave that to me? All I want you to do is get the bookings and you can start now. Oh, there you are. Say, isn't there something about the groom dancing with the bride on their wedding day? I'll bet you made that up. Will you excuse us, Leo? Well, Al Borden! Congratulations. Glad you came. Excuse me, will you, honey? Say, are you serious? You just got married. Thank you, Mr. Borden, for my first wedding present. Leo. Mary needs a partner. Mary isn't the only one. Al, listen... You don't think he's doing the right thing, do you? You mean quitting Ben? As an agent, no. As a friend... And what about me leaving Sutherland? Mary... you leaving Sutherland after all your hard work? And mine? Bill doesn't want me to work anymore. Love, he can handle, but I wish he'd leave the business end of it to me. You'll keep on looking out for him, won't you, Leo? For ten percent, I'd look after my own mother-in-law. ( extravagant theme playing ) Well, I wouldn't say she had buckteeth, but she was the only girl I knew that could eat an apple through a picket fence. ( chuckles ) ( Bill plays accordion ) That was funny. BILL: And so I said to the fellow, "If that's your wife, buddy, you're in a lot of trouble." ( both chuckle ) That was funny, wasn't it? Yeah, that was funny 20 years ago. Well, don't worry. Once Bill starts to warm them up, the audience will really go. They're going now. Out of the theater. LEO: "Short, short story. "Ben Bailey broke in new partner, "socko Baltimore, "ditto Boston, ditto Washington." Here's the important part... "Bill Miller, single, 12 minutes. "Lays egg in Newark, "ditto Camden, "ditto Wilkes-Barre, ditto Scranton." That wiseacre! I'll call those guys... Shut up! What? I said, shut up. You've got yourself in a spot because you got a swellhead. Some fairy godmother must've whispered to you and told you that you don't need nobody. Well, you better stop listening to pixies and listen to your agent. You're not a single, you never will be. You're a nice guy, and you got talent, and you got a nice wife, but you're gonna blow them all off if you don't start listening! Wanna hear what's wrong with your act? Well, sit down, because I'm gonna tell you. You think that you can come out and sing and be cute. Well, cute songs are a nickel a dozen. You need a new opening. A comedy song and two funny stories. Not those broken-down jokes from Al Borden. And a finish. Did you ever hear about that? A "San Francisco" finish. Cohan did it with a flag. It's the most important thing of all! Well, it's easy to tell me about it. Yeah? Well, here's how you do it. You go down to any music publishing house, and you get one of those schnook song pluggers. You put him out in the audience, then you introduce him. But I don't want any... Yes, there you go again! He's not your partner, he's a stooge! All you have to say is, uh, "Ladies and gentlemen, "we're very lucky to have in the audience this afternoon "a Mr. Sam Jones or Mr. Bruce Anybody, "the author of that big song hit, 'Your Father's Mustache' or 'Your Uncle's Pistol.'" Then you roust the guy around. The audience laughs. It's sock. You think that'll be good? What do you want, a sworn affidavit? I'll call Sam Robertson and get you a guy. Now, get out of here, I'm busy. ( rings ) ( elegant piano music playing ) Hello? Hello, Leo. Yeah. Song plugger? Oh, no, no, Leo, I need all I've got. ( loud crash ) ( clatter ) Wait a minute, Leo, wait a minute. I think I've got just the boy for you. Yes. Oh. Oh, you'll love this kid. Sure, you can pay him what I pay him, 15 dollars a week. Yeah, he... He loves to sing... and he's smart as a whip. That's right. Okay, Leo. Goodbye. Miss Reagan, what did that idiot do this time? He dropped a stack of records. Is he bleeding? No, I don't think so. Oh, too bad. Well, anyway, I think we're going to lose him. You mean they're gonna come and take him away? No, but I've just put over the biggest business deal of my career. Where is he? He's on his lunch hour. He's allowed 30 minutes. Hmm. Well, take his head out of the feedbag and tell him I want to see him. He's very insistent on that full half-hour. He puts great stress on proper nourishment. You tell him I wanna see him right away. Yes, sir. Miss Reagan. Yes? Tell me the truth. Do you honestly think he's human? I've heard people bet both ways. ( sighs ) ( whistling ) Stick around, mister. There'll be a spot in just a minute. Never mind. ( bell rings ) I would like to have... ( clears throat ) Uh... ( bell rings ) Could I...? ( coughs ) Could I get a...? ( clears throat ) I would like to have a... ( water splashes ) A glass... What'll it be, bud? Oh, I'd like a glass of hot water, please. Hot water. Yeah. Thank you. What'll you have with it? Oh, that's all. That's all? Just hot water? Yeah, I want it for my tea. You've got a nerve. Driving away my customers and making your own tea! Now, get out here! Beat it! Beat it! You take your hands off me! I'll pay you for the hot water, here's a nickel. Now, get out of here and quit taking up space! Don't you put your hands on me! I'll call a policeman! I paid for the hot water and this is a public restaurant. I got a perfect right to sit here. That's the law. The law? You heard me. Look it up yourself in the code book of the City of New York. Article nine, paragraph six, revised. And I got friends on the force. Don't you give me no trouble. Excuse me. Well... ...you got everything. That saves me a lot of trouble. ( laughing ) ( chuckling ) Yeah, my mother makes my lunch every morning, so I don't ruin my stomach in these sloppy hash houses. Gahh...! Don't you touch me, I got friends on the force. Thank you. I don't use pepper. Sugar? Oh, thank you. I beg your pardon. Cream or lemon? Oh, I always use cream. Cream. But don't bother. I brung my own. ( blows ) ( squirt ) Ah-haaaaaa. I'm just trying to be helpful. Thank you. You're welcome. Ah! That sandwich. Wouldn't you like me to toast it for you? Oh, would you? Aw! That's it! Oh, you broke the whole hand! You deformed me! Now, I won't be able to play with the other children! What are you yapping about? You still got four fingers left. Yeah, but when I grow up, I might want to play the piano, maybe. You're running a very unsanitary establishment. You can rest assured, I'm going to report you to the Board of Health! Ted! I've been looking all over for you! Mr. Robertson wants to see you right away. Come on. Why didn't you find me sooner? I'm never coming back here again! You just lost a customer! ( piano playing ) Oh, Ted, here's that phonograph handle you wanted. Oh, thanks, Duzik. I'll give you the money for it on payday. Miss Reagan... Hurry up. You're three minutes past your half-hour. Yeah, but Miss Reagan... Now, Ted! ( shatters ) ( sighs ) ( inhales ) ( laughs ) I-I'm sorry, Mr. Robertson. I'll give you the money for it on payday. Careful, Ted, don't cut your throat on my time. Mr. Robertson, it was an accident! I didn't mean to do it. I had Duzik's phonograph handle and I was just gonna Come in, boy. Knock on the door, that's all. Come in, boy. Don't pick on a little guy. Come in. It's all right, don't get excited. Sit down, son. Me? Yes, sit down. Well, Bill, there's your... ...man. Hit where there's padding. Hit where there's padding! Come on, kid. What do I do? Oh, just go right ahead with him, that's all. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Grab those, huh, kid? Y-You want I should go with him? More than anything in the world. ( smash ) Ohhh! I-I'm sorry, Mr. Robertson. I-I'll pay you for that on payday. He sings too, huh? ( sighs ) MS. REAGAN: Good luck, Mr. Miller. ( traffic ) Hello, sweetie. Myrtle Theatre, Brooklyn. How are you, sweetheart? MARY: You wouldn't mind telling me where you were the last hour? I was working, doll. I was getting some new jokes. I'll bet. From Al Borden. Why don't you marry him? That's not funny. Neither are his jokes. Mary. Mary... ...I'm sorry. That's very nice of you. Well, I am. You know how important this is to me. Well, I'm pretty fed up. Ever since the day we were married, all I've heard is Al Borden and his jokes and the act. That's a fine way to talk. You know I'm trying to make good. All right, then, let's not talk. BILL: Mary! Hey! Oh, take care of this, will you, kid, and I'll see you in the dressing room. Mary! Six dollars, buster. Oh, that's very reasonable for such a nice cab. Now, hold it. That's the fare, birdbrain. Now, pay me or I'll charge you for waiting. You don't believe in keeping all your eggs in one basket, do you? ( chuckles ) ( chuckles ) Wait a minute, that's only five. I said six, didn't I? Could I have some back? What? Well, then could I just have a nickel for carfare or a cup of coffee? You panhandler. ( pops ) ( air whistling ) CABDRIVER: Hey!

I'm sorry about last night, but it's like I told you, honey. I want to get up there where you'll be proud of me. And sometimes I'm in such a hurry, I just get carried away. ( stomp ) Oh, come on in, kid. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, but if you won't need me anymore... Put the big one up there. ( crash ) Watch that. Easy! ( knocks ) Yes? MAN: Five minutes, Mr. Miller. Okay. Mr. Miller, would you like me to put this away? Yeah. Come on, let's go, Mary. ( applause ) ( band playing fanfare ) Come on, kid! Mr. Miller, I better be getting back. Mr. Robertson's gonna miss me. Shh. See that box? Yeah. You go on up there. Oh, to see the show? Thanks, Mr. Miller. For free? Yeah. Go right through there. Good luck, darling.

Something you're getting for nothing. Did you ever hear of a fellow named Jimmy Lyons? Well, for your information, Jimmy Lyons is the fellow that wrote one of the greatest hits around today. A song called "For You." Is he kidding? Give him a chance. And it just so happens we have Jimmy Lyons in our audience today. Let's have him take a bow. ( applause ) House lights! No, you. Me? Come on, stand up, take a bow. Don't be shy. Get up. Come on. Ooh. Oh! Oh, lady! Lady! Lady! Lady! ( laughter ) Oh, lady! Hey, Mr. Miller! My ha-ow! Hey! Heeey! Hey! Miller! Hey! ( applause ) Lady!

Say, what kind of a voice do you have? Until I was 18, I was a soprano. Soprano? Yeah, but then my mother told me I was born a boy. Don't tell me you were born. What do you think, I came from an egg? No, the chicken would've buried it. Ha ha. Well, my mother loves me. I'll bet she was disappointed, I'll bet she wanted a child. Well, she got one. Look up the records. I... I was born at the Mercy Hospital. What's the matter, were you sick? No, I wanted to be near my mother. ( laughter ) Mercy Hospital. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it? What's wrong with Brooklyn? Any big men born in Brooklyn? No, just babies. ( laughter ) How about, uh, "For You"? For you? How about for me? No, what about it? How about what? "For You." You said that. I know it. What about it? Sing it. Sing what? "For You." I don't know it! ( laughter ) Well, "Who's Your Little Whozis?" None of your business! No, I mean, sing it! ( applause ) All right, but stop hollering. I'll start.

Who? The fellow in the box. Oh, sure. See what I mean. If you just keep punching... Oh, darling... I don't know whether I'll let you book him now. Come in. Hello, Mary. Hello, Leo. That's more like it. Congratulations, Bill. You know Frank Darling here. Oh, hi, Frank. How are you? Mrs. Miller. Mrs. Miller, how do you do? Well, Frank here wants to book you on the Orpheum Circuit for about ten or 12 weeks. What did I tell you, Mary? That's right. You and, uh, what's-his-name. Who? The stooge in the box. That's right. Where is he? Did you see him, Mary? No, dear. By the way, what's his name? What? What's his name? What's his name? Well, no one told me. I never saw him before. That's fine. Leo. How should I know, I've never seen him before either. Somebody better find him. You're not kidding. And when you do, put a ring through his nose. Gee, Ma, I didn't know he was gonna ask me to sing. And everybody laughed at me. Now, don't worry. It's all over. Ohh. I ran all the way home. It's a wonder I didn't get runned over. Theodore, it's done with. Don't make a big thing of it. Big thing of it. You should see this guy, Ma! Boy, if he ever got his hands on me, he'd probably choke me to death. ( automobile stopping ) Ma! Ma! The man. The man's coming! Who's coming? What are you talking about? The guy! Ma, the guy with the act! Oh, Theodore! Oh, Ma, I gotta get out of here! ( knocks ) Ahhhh ha ha. Ma. Ma, don't say nothing. Ma, shhh. Theodore. What are you doing? Don't say a word. Give me your glasses, Ma. Wh...? Shh. He won't know me. Shh. Theodore! Coming! Theodore, where are you? Shhh. Wrong apartment. Does Ted Rogers live here? Uh, Ted Rogers? Uh... Mother, didn't Ted say he was going to South America this afternoon? Oh, who do we know there? Uh, yes, that's right. Yes, he left this afternoon. Fine boy. Fine boy, that Ted. Smart as a whip. Hey, what are you trying to do? You wouldn't hit a man wearing his mother's glasses, would you? Now, look... Now, listen... ( whines ) Ooh. Why, Uncle Sholum, how did you get here? No, Ma, it's me, Theodore. Oh. ( giggles ) Now, look here, mister, it wasn't my fault those people laughed at me. You should never have got me to stand up and you shouldn't have had them put that light on me. I... I didn't mean to... W-Well, I apologize. You apologize? And you don't have to give me the $6 for the cab back, even. Oh, I nearly forgot. I brought it over for you. There you are. Oh, thank you. And here's your cap. ( laughs ) No, look, I had the orchestra play the song up high so the people would laugh at you. I had it planned that way. Oh, you wanted they should laugh at me? Oh, sure. You hear that, Ma? I was supposed to be funny. ( laughs ) ( laughs like Mom ) Look, how much does Mr. Robertson pay you a week? Oh, 15 dollars a week. But I owe him for the glass in the office, and I owe him for the glass in the bookcase, and this week, I think for three stacks of records. Mom... take a look at a $40-a-week man, all expenses paid. What? BILL: That's right. I'm paying you 40 dollars a week and expenses. You're working for me. Now, look here, sir, I am not going to do anything dishonest, even for that kind of money! No, you do exactly what you did today. Sit in the box and say all those things? Right. Do I get to sing? You bet. Even if I sing, I still get paid? Well, sure. Ma... ( whispers ): I'll ask him. Mister, my mother and I would like to know something. Yes? Are you for real? Yeah, I'm for real. We got a deal, kid? We got a deal. Okay. Here, save the gags for the act. Well, I guess the only thing that can come between us is dough. ( laughs ) ( Mom laughs ) Hnng... ( chuckles ) ( train chugging ) ( whistle blowing ) Hey, how many of those carrots you eat before going to bed? Oh, lots of them. They're very good for your eyes. Good for your eyes? Sure. Did you ever see a rabbit with glasses? Oh, you want one? No, thank you. I've never been away from home before. ( water splashing ) I don't know whether my mother was crying because she was happy or because she was upset. You know, you have a wonderful wife, Mr. Miller. She's so beautiful and so nice. Aren't you gonna brush your teeth before you go to bed? Well, of course. There's crooks on the train! What do you mean? Well, somebody stole the sink! I better go tell the conductor. They'll make us pay for it. Take it easy. All you do is press the button, pull the handle and it's there. BOTH: Ohhhhh. ( giggles ) ( sighs angrily ) Oh, Mr. Miller! Mr. Millerrrrrrrrrr! Mr. Miller! Oh, Mr. Miller! You'd better get to bed before you drown yourself. Good night, Mr. Miller. You... go up there. ( somber theme playing ) You, up there. ( bonk ) Well, how am I supposed to get up there? Use the steps. Use the steps. Oh. Put this up there. ( thwack ) Mr. Miller? Yes? How do you put these lights out? There's a switch up there, kid. Use it. Mr. Miller. What? How far are we from New York? Oh, I don't know. About 200 miles. Gee, I'm homesick. No, that's just the carrots. No. From carrots, I get nauseous. I'm just lonely. Mr. Miller, my mother sings me to sleep. I am not your mother. Huh. Isn't that silly? I know you're not my mother because my mother's a woman, and you don't look anything like my mother. Besides, my mother isn't married to Mary. That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard, Mr. Miller. Why, you could no more be my mother than... All right, go to sleep. I'll sing to you. Gee, thanks.

About six minutes. Heinz is on now. We don't have much time. We gotta work fast. Let go of me. I'll get some black coffee. I can take care of myself. Okay. Shhh. Bill, shhh. Come on, stop. I know it, I gotta get dressed and I gotta go on. Here. Don't "shush" me. What, are you taking over? What, are you head man or something? Bill, take it easy, Bill, will you? Snap out of it.

Stewed to the gills. Oh, no, sir. He's just tired. Tired? He's paralyzed. Tell Heinz to stall. Hurry up. Come on, snap out of it, Bill. Rogers, he'll never make it. You'll have to go out there alone and do something. Me, alone? I can't. What'll I do? Do anything. You're an actor, aren't you? I am? What're you gonna do with that? Well, in case anyone throws anything, I can hide behind it. Gee, Mr. Winston, I'm sorry about Mr. Miller. He's never... What is it? Heinz stole three more bows. He can't stall any longer. Come on, boy. He's never done that before. ( groaning ) I don't think you know what you're doing. Never mind. Get out there. ( band playing graceful music ) ( applause ) Uh, hello. Uh... ( clears throat ) Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I-I call you ladies and gentlemen. Y-you know what you are. ( laughter ) Um, I-I know you're out there. I can hear you breathing. ( laughter ) Stop that! You're not supposed to laugh at me. I'm not Bill Miller. He sings like a bird. I sing like a bird too, a vulture. ( laughter ) I said, stop it. You're not supposed to laugh at me. I only came out here to tell you what Bill Miller does. He tells a lot of funny jokes, like the one about living over at the hotel. He has a beautiful room. I have one too, that overlooks the park. As a matter of fact, it overlooks it completely. ( laughter ) It's a lot like, uh, uh, from where I come from, in Brooklyn. I come from a very tough neighborhood in Brooklyn. I was sort of head of the block. Yeah, they all called me "Blockhead." ( laughter ) W-would you like to hear me sing a song? ( applause ) Would you please play some music for me? ( romantic theme plays ) Wait a minute. ( music stops ) Hey, you. Where do you think you're going, mister? Sit down, there. You can't walk out of here. But I have... Oh, no, you can't walk out on Bill Miller's act, even when he isn't acting. What do you want to do, give us a bad name? Sit down. But I have to... Oh, I don't care. You sit down there. ( laughter ) ( applause ) There too. Now, you stay there, and nobody else try and walk out of the theater, while I sing for Bill Miller. Where's my accordion? Shhh. Don't shush, quiet me. I got to go on there. You're on now, and doing great. What?

I didn't see you billed anywhere. Oh, I don't care. You make the act. How much does he pay you a week? Enough. Does he get plastered like this very often? He never gets plastered, and he ain't plastered now. Boy, you sure are touchy. I'm just trying to pay you a compliment. I figured that sometime if you ever get tired of no dough and no billing, you can always... Now, wait a minute, Mr. Heinz, you can't say anything against Bill Miller. He took me out of a stockroom, see? I was only getting $15 a week, see? But I'm only trying to... Now I'm getting $40, see? TED: How are you, Bill? Get your hands away from me. You know where you're going? You're going back to Brooklyn. That's where you're going. Back to Brooklyn. Take it easy, Bill. Get your hands away from me. I know what I'm doing. Take it easy. Shhh. He's resting. Boy, can he use it. Do you think we should call a doctor or something? Why not use a blotter? I'll call a cab. Thanks. Mr. Winston... you won't tell anybody... that he was sick, will you? Don't worry, I've had actors getting sick on me before. Thanks. Thank you. Good thing you went out there. You sure you never did a single before? I never did nothing before... and I'm never gonna do nothing again. Hey, just a minute. Just a minute, buddy. What do you think you're doing? Aw, just a second, buddy. What do you think you're doing? ( mumbling ) ( phone ringing ) Well, shut up. I'm having enough trouble. Hello. Hello. Who? I feel like A feather in the breeze ♪ No, he isn't in. Wait just a minute. La da da dah ♪ Ah ya d... ♪ ( muffled humming ) Hello? Mary? Hello, how are you? Oh, um... Wa... Just a minute. ( humming ) We... Just a minute. ( muffled humming ) Hello, Mary, how are you? This is Ted. Hello, Ted. Fine, thanks. Say, I've been reading about you. Oh, yeah. ( laughs ) Is Bill there? Bill? Oh, he's fine. Is he out? Is he out? Yeah, he's out. Oh, I mean, he's out playing a benefit, Mary, for some society. Yeah, he's fine. Uh-huh. All right, I'll tell him. All right, Mary. Bye. Good night. ( humming ) Shhh. Shhh. "Sensational. Bill Miller, exclusive management, Leo Lyman." That's a beautiful ad, and the picture looks just like you. What did Mary say last night? O-oh, nothing. I mean, she just wanted to know how you were, et cetera, and so forth. What did you say? I said that you hadn't come in yet, that you were playing a benefit. Oh, you mean you covered for me? Ow! I hope I didn't say the wrong thing. Wrong thing? You're not mad? No, I'm not mad. Thanks. We're friends? We're friends. ( laughing ) ( knocks ) Get that, will you, kid? Yeah. What happened? My leg fell asleep. Hello. Surprise. ( chuckles ) Well, Leo, what's the good word? I was gonna send you a wire but I figured it'd be better if I came down myself to Pittsburgh to tell you the good news. You know, you're not the only one that's a ham. The Palace, New York. That's right. Next Thursday. Oh, boy, now my mother can come and see me for free. Oh, yes, there's another thing, in case you're forgetting it. Thursday is also Mary's birthday. That's right. What other agent could arrange for things like that? How did you arrange to have Mary born on Thursday? Give me the coat. Let go. Let go. I'm not touching it. Are you crazy? You sewed it to the jacket. I'm sorry, Mr. Miller. It'll only take a second. I'm sure glad you reminded me of Mary's birthday. Yeah. Listen, kid... when you get that button straight, send this off to Mary. And send some roses too. Y-yes, sir. Leo... let's get some coffee and talk money. How could you find a subject so close to my heart? "Mrs. Bill Miller, 115 East 54th Street, New York, New York. "Home for your birthday. Big surprise. Bill." ( clicks ) "Darling Mary. "Home for your birthday. Big surprise. "I love you. Bill. "P.S. "Love from the kid." ( traffic ) All right, open your eyes. Happy birthday. Oh, Bill, what a wonderful present. You're playing the Palace. I'm so proud of you. And they said I couldn't do a single. Well, there you are. Oh, by the way, honey, I want you to have a big birthday party tonight. Invite all the guys that said I couldn't make it, and some of your friends. How about that? That's fine, just fine. Oh, and I have something else, Mary. I wrote a song for you on the train. I wrote the words. Bill wrote the music. "A Girl Named Mary." Why, thank you, Ted. I know I'll love it. Come on, let's go, Mary. Oh, yes. Come on, kid. William. Well, Ben. Hello, Mary. Hello, Ben. What are you doing here? Here's where I lost you. Here's where I pick you up again. Hello, Ted. You developed into quite an actor. Ahh... Uh, look, Mary, I'm going back to take a look at my dressing room. Now, you stay here with Ben. All right. When I come back, I'll buy you lunch. Come on, kid. Wanna tell Uncle Ben? Well... don't you think he should have Ted's name around here somewhere? Well, you know, I've got a sneaking feeling that he's saving that grand gesture until he's a big hit here at the Palace. You really think so? Sure. Yeah, this looks all right. Put the stuff here. Now, get some lunch and I'll see you later, kid. Thank you. ( knocks ) Come in. ( sweet, emotional theme playing ) Oh... Hello, handsome. Gee, I'm glad you made good. Is that so? Sure. I've been following your tour. What for? Because I think you're cute. Why isn't your picture in the lobby? You're pretty fresh, ain't you? How did you get in here? I told the doorman I was your girl. My girl. What are you trying to do, ruin me? You get out of here. It ain't right for you to be in my dressing room. I mean, Mr. Miller's dressing room. Okay, I'm going. But when you start thinking about girls, I want you to think about me. I ain't gonna think about girls. You shave, don't you? Yeah, I started to shave. You'll be thinking about them. So long. WOMAN: Hello, handsome. Hello, handsome. Hello, handsome. Hello, handsome. ( coughs ) ( exotic theme playing ) Come with me to the Casbah. ( deep voice ): Come with me to the Casbah. "Hi, cutie, "in case you want to return this handbag, "my phone number is Dewey 6-9098.

"But for the next hour, I'll be in the drugstore around the corner." ( upbeat theme playing ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( laughter ) Oh, hey, wait a minute! What is it? Don't you want your soda? This is a very funny way for a lady to try and meet a fellow, leave her purse on the seat and then come next door... Well, I just wanted to meet you. Well, why don't you get yourself introduced? Oh, excuse me. My name's Jennie Tait and this fellow's name is... What did you say your name was? Ted Rogers. Would you please introduce us? ( clears throat ) Mr. Rogers? Yeah? May I present Miss Genevieve Tait. Pleased to meet you. Now, will you have your soda? Uh-huh. ( slurps ) How did you know I like chocolate? Did anyone ever tell you you're adorable? No. Well, you are. You might not believe this, but I was a very ugly child. ( band playing soft music ) Stop looking at the watch, Mary. He'll be here. Look at the kid. Oh, uh, Frecklehead... I mean, Miss Tait, this is Mrs. Miller and this is Mr. Lyman. Hello. Er, did I do it all right? You certainly did. Happy to know you, Miss Tait. Hello. Her name is really Genevieve, but I think it best we all call her Frecklehead. Okay, Frecklehead. Frecklehead. Is it all right that I brought her to the party? Of course. I'm delighted to have her. I'm glad of that, Mrs. Miller. Congratulations on your birthday. Why, thank you. Have a nice time. Thank you, we will. Genevieve. Er, Frecklehead. Gee, she's nice. And pretty. You're pretty too. Did you always have freckles? Yes, and I hate them. I think they're very becoming. It just goes to show what you know. What do you wanna do, start something? I'm sorry, Leo. You know he wouldn't stay away unless it was someone or something very important, Mary. It's always someone or something. Leo, you've known him for so long. Why is he so thoughtless of everyone? He's just going through a stage now, Mary. He just hit "Ol' Man River" success. Maybe the water's a little bit too deep for him. But don't worry. They all come ashore. I... I know this is just ambition. Down deep inside, there's a wonderful, sweet guy. I found it once... and I'll bring it out again. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's have a drink. To Mary and Bill. He wouldn't like the billing. ( simple, pleasant theme playing ) This is where I live. Oh. Well... ...good night. I had a wonderful time. Well, good night. I'll see you. I hope so. Thanks for everything. That's all right. Frecklehead, you know I... I wonder... Yes? Well, I never kissed a girl before, and... Well... You never what? You heard me. I never kissed a girl before in my whole life. You're sure? Sure, I'm sure. Never mind. Oh, just a minute. I'm never gonna do that again. Did it do something to you? It had no effect on me whatsoever. ( crashing ) Ba-aaaaa-aaaa-ha. Mary. ( knocks ) Mary. ( sobs ) I'm sorry I missed the party, honey, but I couldn't help it. ( sniffles ) Oh, Mary, please don't cry. I love you, honey. Honest, I do. But I was so excited. I want to tell you about Sutherland and everything. I don't care about you or Sutherland or anyone. But he wants me in the revue, honey. He gave me a contract to look over. Here, look under the door. I'll show it to you. Okay. What's the matter? She locked me out. Really? Is that legal? Shhh. I'm sorry. You don't have to get sore. I was just asking. You know, you may not think that in this head anything can happen, but it can. I got an idea. Listen. ( indistinct whispering ) You got it? Yeah. ( accordion plays ) Shhh.

We'll take Ted along as a chaperone. ( giggles ) Oh, I can't help it, it's so romantic. ( festive dance music playing ) Waiter, some more champagne, please. Yes, sir. ( pop ) Oh, excuse me. Don't you think Ted's had enough? ( whispers ): He's all right. You whispering about me? Oh, no. What gives you that idea? I don't know. Am I being very extraordinary?

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We don't usually do this, but there's a young man here I'd like to have you meet. He's just scored a terrific hit at the Palace Theatre. Mr. Bill Miller! Thank you. Excuse me, will you, honey? Thank you, Tommy. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, but this isn't my night at all. We have a young lady in the audience who's celebrating her birthday. And by a very strange coincidence, I have written a new song, especially for her. And maybe we can get her up here to sing this song. She happens to be my wife, and also the great Sutherland Revue star, Miss Mary Turner. ( applause ) Hiya, Big Shot. Hiya, Heinz. Pardon me. Mary, you say something sensational to the people and I'll talk with the piano player. Thank you.

Oh, it's just a telegram from C.B. Cochran in London. He wants me to star in his new revue, just in case you think I'm an old has-been. Well, you tell Mr. Cochran to go peddle his papers. Happy day-after-your-birthday. Oh, Bill! This must have cost a fortune! Well, you know what everybody says, "Money isn't everything, and I'm the guy that keeps proving it." You know something? You've got your arms around a guy who's gonna star in Sutherland's Revue. Really? Signed, sealed and delivered this afternoon. Ted too? Well, sure. Everywhere I go, Ted goes too. I hope so. What do you mean, "I hope so"? Well, I... I thought after you opened at the Palace, it would've been nice if you'd given him some kind of recognition. Now, look, honey, will you leave the kid to me? I know how to handle him. He's happy, I'm happy, you're happy. We're a big hit. I guarantee I'll always take care of the kid. You promise? You won't ever treat him like a... Like a what? You know...

Since the both of you are practically my mother and my father, and I wouldn't do a thing without consulting you, and after we open and we're a big hit... ( laughs ) After we open and we're a big hit, and after I'm married, what should I do, buy a house or rent an apartment? Well, whom are you going to marry? Whom am I going to marry? I am going to marry Miss Genevieve Tait. Frecklehead, that's whom. Well, I suggest you ask Miss Frecklehead whether she'd rather live in a house or an apartment. Oh, no, I have to disagree with you there, Mary, because I feel it is the husband's place to decide. Well, she's gonna live there with you. She is? I mean, she is. That's right. Yeah. Would you do me a favor, Mary? If I can. The next time you see Frecklehead, will you ask her to ask me to ask her to marry her? Because I'm gonna ask her. Well, I'll do my best. Gee, thanks, Mary. Bye. My best too. ( laughs ) ( children playing ) Freckle... ( clears throat ) Frecklehead? Yes? I wanted to ask you... Yes? Well, I thought that maybe you and me could... Yes?

Go ahead, try it on. I'd love to marry you... but I gotta tell you something first. Can't you tell me after we're married? No, it's very important. I think you're a big dope because you're letting Bill Miller make a fool of you. Wait a minute! I won't wait a minute! He's making a fool of you! Frecklehead, Bill Miller is my friend. And besides, whatever we do is no business of yours! If I'm gonna marry you, it's a lot of my business! Well, wait until after we're married, then! Okay! Okay! ( sobbing ) USHER: Curtain going up.

"It's a long time since Broadway has seen a fellow "as funny as the man in the box. "And, incidentally, "though he wasn't billed anywhere "in the theater last night, "his name is Ted Rogers. Make a note, everybody... Ted Rogers." Well, how about a drink, everybody? That's a good idea. Go ahead, Bill, you make the toast. I'd like to propose a toast to a wonderful guy... Mr. Sutherland. Well, anyone like to dance with an agent? Yes, I'd love to. Hello, Mary. Sit down. What's on your mind? Leo, do you think Bill has any intention of putting Ted's name up and recognizing him as a partner? I don't either. Never found that sweet, wonderful guy underneath, after all, huh, Mary? Maybe there is a nice guy underneath, but... I'm tired of digging. ( phone buzzes ) Yes? It's Bill. He's outside. I don't want him to know I'm here. Just a minute. Come in here. All right, send him in. Well, Leo, looks like I hit the jackpot. You ever read such reviews? Tell you what I want, Leo... Full page ads, back page. Variety, Billboard, all the trade papers in the country. Shoot the works. Full-page picture of me... What about the kid? What about him? Well, I think you ought to have his picture and his name on the ads, right alongside of yours. Well, I don't. Well, everybody else does... Critics, all your friends, even your wife. Look, Leo, no critic's gonna tell me how to run my business. Neither are my friends or my wife. This is my act. Bill Miller, single-O. The kid's all right. Nobody likes him better than I do. There's something you wise guys don't understand. Once that kid's name is mentioned, then he's no more part of the audience. And when that happens, he stops being funny. You're right, and I'd agree with you 100 percent if the kid was an ordinary stooge. But he's not. He's half your act. Sure, and he's gone over that way because he's still a member of the audience. Unknown. LEO: Bill, you're a phenomenon. I've handled hundreds of actors in my time, but you take all the prizes. You're a ham with a double M. What's that? It's our contract. Are you serious? Yep. I woke up this morning and it suddenly occurred to me, you have to let the other fellow live. Unless you do, the whole thing is nothing. All my life, I've wanted to do one thing as a matter of principle. Well, today, I am a man. That was a mighty pretty speech you just made. What's going on here? But yours wasn't. Your little speech was petty and kind of cheap. I'm surprised you didn't cancel him a long time ago, Leo. Well, if that's the way he feels, I don't need him. You're right, Bill. You don't need him, either. And every day it'll be someone else you don't need. And one night, you'll be sitting around all by yourself in front of a pile of your own photographs. Well, from now on, you may consider our contract at an end. Mary, you don't mean that. ( plays sad, lonely music ) Well, what's the matter with you? Oh, nothing. Come on. What is it? I don't know if I should say it. Go ahead and say it. What are you gonna do about Mary, Bill? You got any ideas? No. Except I don't think you ought to let her go away. It's a free country, isn't it? Sure, Bill. But she loves you, and if... there's something wrong, I think you ought to... go to her and try and straighten it out. Maybe it's none of my business but... That's right. It's none of your business. Yeah, maybe it's not. So shut up. You know... I think you had a lot to do with Mary leaving me. Oh, don't say that, Bill. All that stuff about anything I do is okay with you. I knock my brains out trying to make something of myself. And you, you with your checkered suit. What do I get for it? You're talking crazy, Bill. You shouldn't be thinking that way. I don't like to hear it. You don't like it? Well, that's tough. I don't like it. I'm sick and tired of looking at you anyway. You really mean that? Okay, Bill. I'll move out of the apartment tonight. That makes two of us. Bye, Bill. Don't drink too much. Remember, you got a show to do tonight. You bet I got a show to do. I'll show everybody. Gee, Mary, I wish you weren't going to Europe. Thanks, Frecklehead, but... it'll be good for me to get away. Doctors say nothing like an ocean voyage... ( phone rings ) Answer it, please. Sure. Hello? Oh, just a minute, Mr. Sutherland. ( whispering ): It's Sutherland. I'll take it. Hello, Mr. Sutherland. Mary, I hate to bother you, but we've quite a problem. Bill's insisting upon going on, but there's no Ted. He and the kid have broken up. I can't find him anywhere. And Bill wants to do a single. Bill's all right. He's just been trying to prove something since the day he was born. Mr. Sutherland, would you do me one big favor? Let Bill do his single. But, Mary, that's too risky. One act would never make or break the Sutherland Revue, but it might make or break a great guy. Please, Mr. Sutherland. For me? For his sake? Let him go on. So this panhandler walked over to me and said, "I haven't had a bite in three days." So I bit him. Which reminds me, I was standing in front of the Hotel Astor... That's where I live, in front of the Hotel Astor... When my wife came up to see me. You know, my wife and I were gonna get a divorce, but we couldn't figure out who... got the custody of her mother. ( murmurs ) Which reminds me, I took my mother-in-law to the beach, but the only thing that got sunburned was her tongue. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize. This is the Sutherland Revue... which is supposed to bring you the finest entertainment that can be offered. You've heard of an act, Bill Miller. And Bill Miller is me. But I'm only half an act. The fellow that made the act work is a little guy by the name of... Ted Rogers. And he isn't here tonight. I can play an accordion and sing a song. But I need that spark, that something... the chemistry that makes two men a successful team. I've bored you, and... I've imposed upon you. I've done an injustice to an audience. This is the biggest sin in show business. To be a ham. I humbly apologize. Who's your little whozis? None of your... ( laughter ) business. Who's your turtledove? ( applause ) Who's your turtledove? Who's your turtledove? ♪ Who's your turtledove? ♪ Who's your little who-hoozis? ♪ Who do you love? ♪ You mean you finally learned the words? Listen to this. ( exactly like Bill ): Who's your little whatzis? ♪ Not bad, huh? ( exactly like Ted ): That you're dreaming of ♪ I've been paying attention too.
