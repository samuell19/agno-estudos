What? July and August - Can't you call him? - I just did. He's coming. It's an hour now. I'm pissed off. Must you talk like that? Mum, it's only words. It's really nothing to do with piss. That wouldn't make sense. When you say "sugar", do you mean sugar? Very funny. I'm sorry. Really sorry. There was... There was a traffic jam for miles. You'd think everyone had fixed to meet here. How are you? OK. Oh my! Are you OK? How was the journey? You didn't see Lady Gaga? Apparently she was here this morning. - Really? - Sure. She's staying in... Mougins. - We should see her. - What's this thing? - Where's the Audi? - It broke down. The garage lent me this. It's fun, no? Look at the luggage, look at the boot. You'll love it. - It'll all fit in like sardines. - It won't. Of course it will. Michel, it won't fit. - Put it here. - It won't fit. OK. We'll put it here. Sorry. Excuse me. There. - Put that in the back. - There. Like that. - Should've taken that one. - The door! Stop it! You'll break it. It's odd, this business of the fire. Maybe someone chucked a cigarette in there. Since there were letters, it might have... A crazy thing to do. No! The luggage! What's this? I know. It doesn't look like it, but it's nearly finished. They really worked hard. I can tell you... Wow. They put in a drain 5 metres deep. Imagine! The amount of digging there was, you wouldn't believe. - They had time. I told them, but they need fine weather. Otherwise the sleeve won't hold. Have a look. I'll try not to get dirty. Look, this is just 10cm. No, Anne. Anne, wait. It won't stay like this. - It was supposed to be finished. - It is. They've finished raising it up. Now they just have to... Pour the concrete. That's all. What have they done since you got here? Drained the sleeve, as I said, or maybe sleeved the drain. That's it. No! Laura! Oh my God! The maintenance people came. There are toxic products! - Get out! - Laura! - Come on! - Get out! Quick! Get out! I bet he's making it up. What? No, really... Hey, Cutie. Forgive me, but I really fooled you then. Really, that's nasty! Cutie, it was a joke. Just a little joke. Come on. I've been with you 15 years, Bertrand. I've earned you a lot of money. It'll be sorted by September. Give me 3 months. That's all. 3 months is nothing, for God's sake. When are you going to own up? What do you mean? Wasn't there a letter from school in the mailbox? No idea. How much time will you gain? You'll pay for it when they find out. - Where are you off? - To see Gwen. - Can I come? - No. Medical Laboratory Oh, shit. My sister's here. Still like a dwarf. What do you mean? Didn't Santa bring you any boobs? Didn't he get your letter? Give it a rest, Gwen. Still no periods? After the age of 14, there's no hope. Target approaching. His name's Romain. He's dead on time. Have you had him? Not yet. I've only been here a week. Tell all. I'm working on it. Can't we talk of anything but sex? You're pathetic. - What? - Not in public, we said. - What public? - You might set fire to something. Don't say that! Watch your own ass! I love your sister. - What are you doing? - What does it look like? - What did you do this morning? - The shopping. - Is that all? - Yes. Don't stand there, you'll get cold. Where's your sister? If it doesn't rain, they'll cover the drain on Monday. Really? Monday? Why Monday? - Can't they do it tomorrow? - Tomorrow.. - Tomorrow's Fukushima. - What? Fukushima. - The terrace, remember? - Sure. Of course. You wanted tiles with a pattern, yes? - They'll be done in 8 days. - 8 days! Are you joking? And then... there's a little problem to sort out. What problem? Cutie, can you leave us a minute? Well, you see... It was refused. - Refused? - Yes. Thanks. What's that? Have you seen my charger? No. - You OK? - Yes. I'm watching... - I'm going to watch a DVD. - OK. Laura, was it you who took my... Sorry. - Whose boat is this? - Mine. - Want to see the papers? - Why not? - Come here often? - Since 4 years ago. My stepfather has a house. We stay 3 weeks, then it's Brittany. "We"? My sister and I. Any more questions? Later. - You have beautiful hands. - What? Nothing. Your hands are beautiful. I never heard that chat-up line before. I've been complimented on my eyes, legs, ass, and I'm not boasting. But never my hands. Take your shoes off. - Why? - To see. It's not allowed on boats. Have a good night? Not bad. - I need to talk to you. - Go ahead. Not now. Go to bed. - Go on now. - OK. When you and Dad spit, did you know you'd never see each other again? - Oh, please. It's odd, to suddenly stop seeing each other. I'm not mad at him. We meet, we talk. No, never. Why ask that? Are you in love? I'd rather die. Right. There. I'm off to town. Do you need anything? - No. - Anne, relax. - We're OK. - What's your plan? The mechanic said he'd need one day? No. I'm not sure. Soon. How will you go to Cannes, then? Do we have to stay a night? Yes, for sure. It's Éric's birthday. There's a dinner, a party, and a brunch. Like a package. When Éric comes in the shop, I'm like beef in aspic. - Nice image. - Very vivid. His friend Éric is tempted by Gallimard. - Michel wants to keep him. - Éric won't go to Gallimard. Gallimard made him an offer, that's all. When we do well in September, Éric will kiss my feet. - I'll make him an offer. - I'll kiss his feet. Right. Back to work. She's a bit mixed up, that one. That's Moon. It's nothing. - Shall we swim? - No. Later. - Got any condoms? - Sorry? You heard me. OK. Well... There's a misunderstanding. You have pretty hands, pretty feet too... But you're not my type at all. Good, you're not mine either. Mum, are you OK? What's up? This is the third one. All the same. What is it? I don't understand. What does it mean? I'm pregnant. With Michel? Of course. - Does he know? - No. Don't tell him. A child, at his age... He may be happy. It's good news. Yes. It's... news. Why react like this? I can't be pregnant at 43. - It's ridiculous. - Forty four. Even worse. What will your father say? And your sister? We'll be back tomorrow afternoon. Don't forget the alarm, the shutters. Close all the shutters. If you need to call, use the landline. Mobiles don't work very well there. When's the babysitter coming? Bye then. - Have fun. - And me? I love that dress. Right. We're off. We trust you to behave well. It's cool, an all-night party. You can get hammered, it doesn't matter, as you're staying the night. Yes. Right. OK, let's go. Bye now. Pissaladière, pissaladière, pissaladière - Do you know if... - Hush! Where's the aspirin? Yes. Not there. - Those are the duvet covers. - Duvet covers? The shit's made my head ache. - Want a drag? - No, thanks. - What's your name? - Laura. You're a good girl. You're a fountain of goodness. - Want to dance? Get dressed! - I am dressed. Oh, the turtle doves! You're ridiculous! Stop drinking. Shall I send the photo to Mum? Is that a threat? Look at you! They're laughing at you. You're ridiculous. Fuck off! - Not in bed yet? - I'm not tired. Is that weed? Stop it. Go away. Not bad. We did a pole dance to this. - You know? - Yes. Stripping, with a fireman's pole. - You do that? - Totally. Enough. You're a great dancer. Really great. But that's enough. OK. Calm down. Let's have some coffee? A coffee and a Nesquik. You prefer Gwen? I prefer not to go to jail. You're 14. Understand? Well, you're... You're 14. Shit, you... Bastard. What's this? I'm sorry, Michel. We've all done it. As long as the house is OK, the rest... Watch out... There. You seem happy. - It's OK. All done. - It's perfect. I'm going out. I'll be back by 7. OK. What? You won't even punish her? I don't believe it. Well, don't. You're 14. It's different. You're mad because you're broke. Your Éric is leaving. And I'm paying for it. It's not fair. I sold the car. I can't pay for the building work, and the bank is bouncing my cheques. How can it happen? I'll mortgage the house, to carry on. But if Éric's novel doesn't sell at least 50,000... it'll be the last book I publish. What? I wanted to tell you, but... well... I thought things would sort out, but they didn't. I'm sorry. Excuse me. It was open. - A recorded letter for you. - Thanks. Thanks. - I'll put it here? - Yes. Laura's school. It's not your decision! I won't go there. How could you lie like that? Last night, and now this! I'm disappointed. - I didn't lie. - You lied about your results! And you started a fire. What if they find out it was you? I won't go to boarding school. Fuck off! Don't talk to me like that. - Does Dad know? - Stop that! Dad agrees. I just talked to him. It's your fault. You were warned. Calm down. Don't dramatize. It's a school, not a jail. Let's go to bed. That's enough. I don't want to go to bed. - You're here? - Why don't you answer? Why aren't you there? What's going on? I'm here. I'm here. It's OK. It's OK. It'll be OK. - What the hell's this? - What do you mean? - This bag, with money and a gun. - Nothing. - I'll explain. - Don't bother. Joséphine, it's a fake. Look. It's a fake. Who the hell are you? - What are you up to? - Calm down. Calm down. Want some? - There. - Thank you. Don't tell me there's no danger. I'm not stupid. The gun's to frighten people. If need be. - You never know. - The other guy may have a real one. Nonsense. Ever had a drink in a bar? - What are you on about? - Just do that for me. Nothing else. Go there, have a drink, call me when he comes out. I could report you. You could, yes. Do it for me, please. What are you up to? Nothing. I'm fed up. - It's too hot. - It is summer, after all. Want some lunch? - Shall I make you something? - No. I'm going for a walk. There's a very good melon. With Parma ham, it's delicious. Michel! - What's HCG? - You've been in our room? What's HCG? Mum's blood's full of it. When were you going to tell me? Everyone else knew! You'd better keep quiet. Not everyone else knew, I can tell you. - Will you keep it? - It's not your business! - Michel and I will talk about it. - About what? At your age? You're crazy! Michel will be 107 when it starts to walk. - Enough. It's dangerous, when you're 45! I've spent 2 hours on the internet. It's dangerous, stupid, selfish! It's too late! - You think you can... - Go to your room! You're bothering us! - Go on. - I'm going. That's the easy solution. I don't want this baby. It won't be my family. I'll never love it! I need some fresh air. It's weird, it's scary, but I'm happy. You must look after yourself. Off you go now. - We'll do as we agreed? - You're stressed out. Not at all. Everyone's ready. OK. What? Yes, yes, coming. Can I sit down? Certainly not. Romain, come and fetch me. I can't stay. No. Now. What do we do? We clear off. I'm sorry. I did what you said, it rained and... Put this on. You'll catch cold. We must go now. I'll call you. I love you. But... - Mr Michel Lanoy? - What? I can... Listen... If it's about that cheque, honestly... Cazeneuve's made a complaint? Because I told him. Honestly, it's nonsense. Wait. Come with me. Come! I'll show you. Look at the state of the house! Look! See this work? It's rubbish! It's me who should complain! I'll complain. - Sir. - What? You misunderstood. We need information about these people. We're asking anyone who knows them. Do you know them? - Yes. Well, a bit. - What have they done? They're suspected of assault and theft of valuable jewelry. But they may have done more. - Meaning? - They're potentially dangerous. - Dangerous? - Potentially. - Did you know? - What? - That they were dangerous. - Potentially. Of course not. You see, she didn't know. Where did you meet them? - Is it your business? - Sorry? - A party in the port. - Stop it. We don't know them. We're leaving. My daughter's no delinquant. Shit! I want a lawyer! What was that? Sorry. Go on. Champagne. Then boarding school. - New year's day, if you're free. - Nitwit. The other platform. Go on. You got a network? Welcome to paradise, girls. Not all at once. Keep some for later. - Well? - Well what? How do you like it? Isn't it beautiful? - It's so ugly. - And freezing. OK. - The keys. - Yes. OK. Shit! - What's that? - An oyster farm. Disgusting! - Dad! - Don't be scared. Goliath! Come here, boy. Come. There. Good boy. Goliath, these are the girls. Girls, this is Goliath. Goliath, gently. Gently, Goliath. But... No! - What is this dog? A bear? - A Newfoundland. - When did he arrive? - 3 months ago. You could have told me. Not bad. - Yes. - Dad. Yes. How's the dog? Good dog. Good dog. OK. - Dad. - Yes. - Mum didn't call you? - No. Why? Are you in trouble? Come and see your room. - Shall we tell him? - Are you stupid? Come and see this room. There's a tailwind. A boat's coming. What do you do? - Come on, you. - Me? I go home quick. To go home, you need the boat. Wait for high tide. You don't have the shoulders to pull it. The first rule is that the sea is like love. You don't treat it roughly, OK? With the sea, you must listen, look at her, understand her. Take your time, tame each other. Once you love each other, really love each other, I mean, then, no, only then... - Right, Pierrot? - Wow. OK. Lesson 1: the boat's position relative to the wind. - What's your name? - Joséphine. Oh yes. Like Napoleon. Did you like it? - What? - The lesson. Tomorrow we go to sea. - You won't believe it. - I don't believe I'll be back. Thanks. Pass me the... Thanks. OK, Cédric? - OK? - Yes. - Were they good? - Yes. They're talented. - Shall we go? - Yes. - Give my best to your dad. - OK. - See you tomorrow. - See you. - Your sister won't eat oysters? - Surely not. You'll only eat crab? There's only crab and lobster. Rich kids. I only like mayonnaise. - OK? - Yes, yes. - Hello. - Hello. - OK? - Fine. - And you? - Great. What would you like? Stop it! Disgusting. You've seen my girls. - They're very pretty. - Thanks. I'm madly in love with you. I think of you as I get up. I think of you as I go to bed. I miss your scent so much. But you left me. Excuse me. - Where are the toilets? - On the right. Thanks. Can I have my jacket? - What's this? - What? Give it here. Shit. Say a word and I'll kill you! I have a surprise. There. You can choose its name. - It can't work like that. - When the tide comes in, yes. It just needs a few repairs. This isn't the sea, it's disgusting! Shit! Fuck! But she's right! It's rubbish! I'll hate boarding school. I'll run away. And Brittany is shit! They really messed you about. But this is hot stuff. "474,000 euros". It's Mum. I'm not here. Just talk normally. - Yes, Mum? - Hello? It's Laura. How are you? Is your sister there? Er... I don't know where she is. What did I want to tell you... Yes. I've just been to the doctor, everything's fine. So it seems you may get a little sister or brother. So it's official now. It's cool. Cool? Is that all you can say? For the brat, it's OK. - Pass me your sister. - What? Pass me your sister. I can't hear. Hello? Hello? - Mum? - Hello? Shit. I'm reading the article. It sounds good. Great. Yes, yes. I have to go. Take care, speak later. - Well? - OK. - So. - He says it's very good. Oh, yes. So... It's me. Call me. I beg you. I must talk to you. I've been thinking. Call me. You called your girlfriend? - What girlfriend? - The waitress. Don't lie to me. I know you as well as if you made me. How did you guess? She's pretty, she seems nice. What's the problem? The problem... She's a kid. I could be her father. I can't go out with a kid at my age. You're not 107 yet. - I must tell you something. - I've been an idiot. You're a good girl, you know. You find her pretty? Yes. But I didn't get a good look. I thought it wasn't serious, but now I can't live without her. - A brandy? - I thought you'd stopped drinking. I have. It's OK. Just the odd brandy with my daughter. - Well? Did you tell him? - What? What? Tell him what? - What did you want to tell me? - Mum's pregnant. What? Mum and Michel are having a baby. They're keeping it. She'll call you tomorrow to tell you. Really? Dad? Are you OK? If you want to go to the beach tomorrow, you have the bikes. Food's in the fridge. I won't be late home. - What's this? - Where are you off? It's 11pm. I'll be back tomorrow, early afternoon at the latest. Wait. Wait, Dad. Wait. This year you must come to Frankfurt with me. Or I won't go. It's simple. And when's Frankfurt? Expecting someone? What on earth? Is it the girls? No, no. They're fine. May I? What's wrong? They told me about... I don't know why, but I came. I know it was stupid. I hung about for hours, not to wake you up. Hold him. What do you want? Chocolate? - Yes. No, tea. - OK. - No. Chocolate. - OK. And croissants. Goliath, sit. Goliath. - Hi. - Hi. Goliath, sit. Good dog. Hello. You're up early. Hi, Goliath. How are you, boy? You like being tickled, don't you? You like that. You know him? Yes. Well, a bit. - Is your father here? - He went to Paris to see his wife. She's having a baby. Hello. What's wrong with her? - What did you tell her? - Nothing. I know it must feel weird. It's weird for me too. And for Michel. The doctors call it a high risk pregnancy. - Why? - I'm 45. 44. Don't worry. It'll be fine. No reason why not. - You take sugar? - No. I know that. I'm asking Franck. He doesn't either. OK. I'll leave you alone. No. Sit down. Keep straight! Follow properly! Goliath! Goliath! Here! Yes! Good dog! Joséphine! You're turning! Shit! I can't do it! Shit! Fuck! Keep calm! Why did you take the dog? He's a guard dog. So the idea is that he stays home to guard the house. in case someone comes there. - What did they take? - I don't know. I haven't checked. I called you. - I'll call the police. - Call the police? We've been burgled, so I'll call the police. I was mostly worried about you. We know what they want. We know who it is. What? Don't be mad. I'll explain. It's complicated. I'm not mad. What did they want? How long have you had that? Did they give it to you? No, don't cry. Explain! I don't know. I didn't know. We found it in my jacket. I swear I didn't know. We found it yesterday. I didn't know. You didn't know? You go to jail for things like that. Receiving stolen goods, it's called. You're an accomplice. How much is it worth? 474,000 euros. - What? - 474,000 euros. Are you scared? No. Evening. I... I'm a friend of Joséphine's. I'd like to talk to her. I know who you are. And what you want. Are you alone? Come in. - Listen, Miss... - Moon. Like the moon. That's my name. Miss Moon. OK. I'll be brief. I'll give it to you. You go away. I won't tell anyone, and you disappear. You and your friends. Far away. Toady! Toady my ass! What came over you? Laura, I think... Laura, go back upstairs. Tell the other bastard that he's... well, a bastard! Laura, Joséphine, go upstairs now. Now! We'll do as you said. Whose turn? Jo's. - She still hasn't called? - No. Not a good sign. - Who hasn't? - Never you mind. - Play, Laura. - It's your turn, stupid. It's no good with only 3 players. Too many cards. Pass. What's up? Nothing. Pass. Pass. Oh! Francky! - What brings you here? - Holidays. You know my girls. Remember Gilles? How could they? Silly. Last time I saw you, you were 2 or 3, and you weren't even born. - We'll go there. - Yes. - You're on holiday? - No. I live here now. - Really? - Yes. You must meet my wife. You're here? Hello. - Don't touch me. - We must talk. Listen to me. Why are you here? You forgot something? Why did you send Moon? Why didn't you come? I felt I couldn't see you and then leave without you. Joséphine. I'm not a bastard. I won't leave without you. Joséphine? What's going on? Jo? Joséphine's not to blame. Is it him? I did like you said. Whose is this car? Can I see the papers? Not really. Where are you going? Far away. Don't worry. So you don't know where you're going, in a stolen car, with a necklace worth a fortune, and if possible with my daughter. - Is that it? - I'm sorry. Come. - What? - Take your stuff and come. Who did you rob? A swine. Yes, well... A rich Italian, a trafficker of something or other. What will you do with it now? Sell it. Then hide away for a bit. Chérif knows a guy in Paris. Yes. At least, I know... I know someone who knows him. You're total idiots. Dad! Laura? Darling? What's up? Darling? - Don't come in! - Open up! Open the door! Open the door. What's going on? Big news. Your sister got her period. Oh, shit. My honey. She's a woman now. Still not talking to us? Why should I? I'm not as stupid as I look. You can fool my sister, but not me. I don't forgive. OK. When I was little, I thought... you kept bleeding forever, when you got your period. - Continuously. - No. Or you'd get empty. The thing is, now I need to take the pill. I could get pregnant. Besides... I must tell you something. I met someone. Maybe I'm in love. Well, I don't know. It's complicated. OK. You mad with me? No. I understand. You're not sad? Come. Laura! - Who has the keys of the stolen car? - Me. Give me them. Come with me. Promise me one thing. You won't see Joséphine again. You won't look for her. Forget her forever. Got it? I promise. Give me the necklace. Get your stuff. Can you steer it? Yes. I think so. Start the engine then. - How long does it take? - 8 hours there, 8 hours back. - What will we do there? - I don't give a damn. I don't think Interpol is after you. Keep your heads down. No mistakes. Don't worry. Britain is wonderful. And the weather's like here. Right. Go back to the house now. Off you go. I love you. Wait. Let's see. No. No! Not with your fingers. OK. I'll go. Yes. No one's here. We're 150km from home. It's better here. No one knows me. It's better here. Go on. "Easy of access. 40 minutes "from the capital. Inside a wooded park, "with sports facilities renovated in 2011. "Swimming pool, tennis court, "basketball court." Sounds like Center Parcs. What are you reading? "Amber", 3 times J, "per S", "except P". Except P? - Yes. - It's nonsense. - No. - Wait, stop. It's there. There on the right. OK. Shall we go? Yes. The room's nice. With a closet for your dresses. What dresses? Phone me, OK? And come home every weekend. Don't tell me: "I want to play tennis with my friends." Anyway, if you don't like it, you... It'll be fine. I promise. Shall we go? I love you, sweetheart. - Your bump shows now. - Impossible. Not yet. You think so? Right. We must go, girls. Bye. Subtitles: ECLAIR
