How are you, Mr Stevens? Good to see you again. Save some of that film for the official opening. - It's gonna be a real wingding. - When was the house built, Mr Stevens? My father started it in 1916. Took four years to complete it. Whose idea was it to turn the estate into a museum? Mine. I've always wanted a place where people could come and visit, rest a while and look at beautiful things. How long have you been collecting? Let's see... Well, I guess I've been collecting all my life. I started out as a boy collecting stamps and then I sold them. Then I started collecting bicycles. Then bicycles led to old cars. Then one day I saw this painting. It was a Renoir. I guess that did it. That led to another and then to another and to another. Then after all these years I decided it was time to share my collection with anybody that might enjoy it, give it to the people. Will your prototype executive aircraft revolutionise the private and commercial industry? I certainly hope so. Will we be receiving a list of the guests you've invited? You'll all get a press kit. What about the plane that's bringing your guests? You'll see the airplane when it arrives. I think you'll agree that we brought these guests down in style. Dulles Tower, 2-3 Sierra Heayy, out of 3,000 VFR for landing. The emergency lights? - Off. - Beacon light off. Radios? - Off. - OK. All righty, gents. She's all set for tonight. Sorry I was late on those boost pumps. Don't worry about it. See you guys later. Why did you mention it? He didn't notice. Are you kidding? Why do you think Stevens hires a guy like him? He notices everything. Well, how did it check out? Just beautiful. She behaved perfectly, Stan. She damn well better. I spent the best part of a year on this project. Now Stevens has got his dream machine, you can go back to that nice executive life of two-hour lunches, golf... I don't play golf. Besides, the job won't be finished until we deliver this baby tonight. That's true. You're not gonna light that thing, are you? No, I've quit smoking. Well, I'm quitting. TWA Flight 34 now arriving at gate 26. Passenger Dupree, please pick up white courtesy phone. All passengers holding tickets on Pan American Flight 10 should be on board. TWA Flight 36 now arriving at gate 37. Passenger Troutman, please come to the American Airlines ticket office. All passengers holding tickets on American Airlines Flight 12 should be on board. - How's it going? - OK. - OK, thank you very much. - Thank you. Wonder which is worth more, the cargo or the plane? It's a toss-up. I'll bet that together they're equal to the GNP of Texas. Lafite Rothschild '45. I didn't know there was any left. After tonight there won't be, Captain. ...tickets on Pan American Flight Four may proceed to the boarding area. - Julie, where's Eve? - In the office. See you later. Mm-hm. - My problem is a fear of flying. What's yours? - What makes you think I have a problem? We've been living together longer than most people are unhappily married. - I don't think you can help me with this one. - I can't help you? You forget that I'm a pilot, the symbol of strength and security. Lightning may flash and thunder may roar around my plane, but when the biggie walks through the cabin, little old ladies stop fingering their beads and sweaty palms dry up. Gallagher is at the controls. No harm can come to anybody. You tell me I can't help you. - Stop talking and hold me. - I can't do two things at once. - Will you try? - I'll try. Listen, wouldn't it just be sensational if after the festivities tonight we announced that we were getting married? Mr Stevens has asked me to take over the Geneva office for a year or longer, and I think I might like to try that. Well, I'll just get the job flying the route from New York to Paris to Geneva. I'll see you once or maybe twice a week. I can't think of a more solid basis for a happy marriage. - I've been through one divorce. - That doesn't make you unique. - Why can't we just keep it the way it is? - No. Because I want a wife and children. Not necessarily in that order, but... Until you make up your mind, why don't you buy me lunch? Yeah... You make more than I do. We'll go Dutch. - They've gone. - Good. Let's get moving. We're behind schedule. Thanks, Julie. Lisa, I'm so glad you're here. I didn't think you were coming. Me neither. Benjy, you remember Eve, don't you? Hello, Benjy. Your father'll be so pleased to see you. I wish the feeling were mutual. I'm doing it for Benjy. - You're just like your father. - What? Stubborn. Stubborn woman. - Have you got everything, Dorothy? - Yes. Good. Get these stowed away. Hey, help me get these things stowed away for take-off. Mrs Livingston, you look wonderful. Is this plane as fantastic as the newspapers say it is? Come and see for yourself. - Well, what do you think? - It's magnificent. Excuse me. Dorothy, get comfortable. And try to relax. Have a drink. It'll do you good. Emily. - I hoped you'd be flying with us. - You're missing a fourth. She just arrived. Come and sit down and join us. - Dr Herbert Williams. - How do you do? - Gerald Lucas. - How do you do? Delighted to meet you. I admire your sponsorship of young artists. Unfortunately, I don't admire your printed attacks on them. My reviews are never meant personally. Only a politician could have said that better. Don't worry, gentlemen. I declare a truce on all art critics. But only for the duration of the flight. Right now the name of the game is poker. Five-card stud, ten-dollar ante. No ceiling on raises and nothing is wild. Any objections, boys? - One of the nicest pictures I've ever seen. - Did you hear that, Mommy? Bonnie's class wrote to Mr Stevens about their painting. He asked them to pick someone to bring it. And they chose me. Well, they couldn't have made a better choice. Flight service, this is 2-3 Sierra Heayy. Any weather updates? Heavy frontal activity off the Gulf Coast is continuing to build. Better keep a pretty tight schedule, Captain. Roger and out. May I have your attention, please? I'd like to take a moment of your time to acquaint you with our airplane. You are now located in the main lounge. Aft of our main lounge area, we have the communication centre, bedrooms and the library with conference facilities. Below, down the centre stairs, we have our crew seating area, cargo storage fore and aft, and a complete galley capable of preparing the most exotic of dishes. Up the forward stairs, we have a small office and, of course, the flight deck. If there are any questions, please, feel free to ask. Thank you. 2-3 Sierra, proceed to runway one niner right and hold for clearance. Roger, Tower. 2-3 Sierra, you're next for take-off clearance. Roger, Tower. Thank you. Good evening. I'm glad you could join us in the inaugural flight of the Stevens Corporation new airplane. - I wish I could be with you, but... - Who's that? - That's your grandpa. - Have I ever met him? - Mm-hm. Once, when you were a little boy. - How little? About like that. In the meantime, have fun and enjoy the flight. Good evening. This is your pilot, Captain Gallagher. Mr Stevens thought you might like a plane's eye view of the take-off. We'll be getting clearance momentarily, so just sit back and enjoy yourselves. 2-3 Sierra, you're cleared for take-off. Roger, Tower. I understand. Cleared for take-off. We're rolling. How fast can this plane go, Mommy? Fast enough. Grandpa sure has a neat plane, doesn't he, Mom? Grandfather has a lot of expensive toys. Who's light? # Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder # And that's what I want to do # Hold you in my life forever # And just keep on loving you # Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder # So take a special look and see # And just possibly # You'll see the beauty that's in me # Come on! Come on! Come on! - I won! - I guess you're just too good for me. - I wanna play with Dorothy now. - Are they getting the best of you? I'm outclassed, that's all. Bonnie, let's see if I can beat you. This will be the last to go in. Right. It's more complicated. And the crew's quarters here? You're talking about a ten-storey structure that's gotta take the stress of the sea. I'll show you the notes I made at the last meeting with the architect. You men are so lucky. I wish I had a hobby like yours. A plan that can harvest the seas for food and save millions from starvation can hardly be called a hobby. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to offend. I can't imagine what made me say a thing like that. I hope you'll let me apologise. I do. You know that I do. I'm terribly sorry. - Mrs Wallace. - Yes. - How's the party? - Party? What party? Oh, I've found a hobby of my own. Philip Stevens collects art. I have now become the foremost collector of toy booze. Wait till you see this. I have a mini margarita. And a teeny Martini. Aren't they cute? This is just about your size, Martin. Come on. Drink with me. Thank you, but I'll leave you to your collection. - That was very good work, Frank. - Very good. I'll put it in with the rest of the presentation. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Why do you treat him that way? - He loves it. Do you know how concerned he is about you? I'm concerned about him. I'm more concerned about him than you are. You're the one who seduced his wife, you know. Yes, I know. I'm lonely. I need someone to be nice to me this week. Can you be nice to me this week? No, I don't think so. What would Martin say if he knew about us? I really don't think he'd mind, do you? Do you? I'm gonna ask him. - Karen. - What? - You're blackmailing me. - Who else have I got to blackmail? I don't get to fool around that much. See you on the ground. We're right on schedule, sir. I don't think the weather'll be a problem. Eve Clayton just walked in. She has a message for you. It's Mr Stevens. - Hello, Philip? - Eve, how are things going? Everything is fine. Lisa and Benjy are here. They're there? Well, that's wonderful. I don't know how you did it, but I thank you a million times. You don't have to thank me. She decided all by herself. Isn't that wonderful? I'll see you at the airport. Bye. Goodbye. Robert, get the car ready. We're going to the airport. And how about this? Lisa and Benjy are coming home with me. By the way, Captain, I've been thinking about what you said. So have I. Can we talk about it in Palm Beach tonight? I think that could be arranged. Yeah. We're right on schedule, but we have to do something about that security guard. Don't worry. When the time comes, I'll take care of him. Champagne on the rocks? I haven't had that in years. How did you know? "Mr Nicholas St Downs III." "London, 1936." I don't believe it. It IS Nicky. I don't believe it. After all these years and you turn up here. Where have you been? - London, mostly. - And you know Philip? Hard to work in the worids of art and money and not know him. - And which worid is yours? - Both. I arrange financing for a number of museums and I've acquired a modest collection of my own. Would you care to see the present I am taking to the museum? I certainly would. I don't know what I'd do if you'd said no. How beautiful. Oh, Nicky. It is good to see you. Captain. We have a low reading for the middle cargo hold. It is low. Maybe one of the sensors is out. Buchek'll take a look at it. Yeah? - Mr Buchek, it's for you. - Yeah? I hear this is a special day for you, Eddie. - The doctor said it's gonna be twins. - I'll check right away. Twins? You must be nervous. No... terrified. It's the first time. I see. Have you seen Mr Stevens' daughter? She was upstairs in the office. I sent her a drink. - Do you mind if I call my wife? - Please do. - Larry, would you take over for me? - Sure thing. - That's OK. - You shouldn't be down here, son. That's all right. Benjy, how are you? Close that hatch. We'll check the pressure on this one. What was that? My ears popped. That's air pressure. Each one of these holds is airtight when it's sealed. How come? So we can carry all kinds of different things in the cargos. This ship's special. - Captain Gallagher. - The dumb indicator light was stuck. - How's the reading now? - Good. Thanks, Stan. - Are you a real policeman, Mr Hunter? - Sort of. - Have you caught a lot of crooks? - A few, but none lately. Will you tell me about them? - Sure. Any time. - OK, Benjy. Hup, hup, hup! Lisa, Lisa. What's wrong? It's the same old story. My father calls and I come running. I think it's wonderful that you came. He's missed you. Two years is a long time. I know that. And in that time I've made a life for myself and Benjy. I'm finally someone other than Philip Stevens' daughter. All he ever wanted to do was to try to help you. I know that. My father's a very powerful man. I don't think he realises it, but he tends to dominate everybody around him. Especially me. But I'm going to tell him that I'm finally living my own life, once and for all. This is a very important time for him. Don't upset him, please. I don't intend to upset him, but I have to tell him how I feel, whether it upsets him or not. I don't think you should. Your father's very ill. The doctors say he has a few months, maybe a little longer. - That's impossible. - No, it's true. I'm sorry, darling. Oh, my God, Eve. It's time for me to stretch my legs, Captain. Right. - Tried the caviar? - No. We've got ten minutes. The important thing is to get Gallagher out of the cockpit. Leave it to me. The diving's the best part. You can't imagine it if you haven't experienced it. It's like exploring a worid hidden from man since the beginning of time. It's beautiful, really beautiful. I couldn't do that. Water terrifies me. It shouldn't. It's wonderful down there. In fact, it's about the only time I ever really feel free. Excuse me. I don't mean to intrude, but could you move your ass, dear? Thank you! That was very cruel. If I weren't cruel, how would people know how kind you are? If I weren't a sinner, how could you look like a saint? Isn't that why we're together? If it isn't, tell me. I'll stop acting like such an idiot. Why should I, my dear? You're so proficient at it. - Forget it. - What? You hit him too hard. He's dead. Come on. Let's get him outta here. Captain Gallagher. This is the flight steward. I'm in the bedroom. - You'd better come back here. - What's your problem? It's one of the passengers, sir. He seems very ill. I'll be right there. One of the passengers isn't feeling well. Nicky? There's no time for that. Get down to the cargo hold. - How are we doing? - Fine. Get him outta here. Time for us to duck under the radar scan and vanish. Flight 2-3 Sierra is about to disappear into the Bermuda Triangle. Something's wrong. - You having problems with that repeater? - No, it's just not here. - I've lost contact with 2-3 Sierra. - Hang on. They're in the Bermuda Triangle. I'll try to contact them by radio. 2-3 Sierra, this is Palm Beach Approach. Do you read? - We can lose these now. - We have lost radar contact. Home free. In 20 minutes we'll be on St George Island. - Any problem on that end? - Why should there be? The airstrip hasn't been used since Worid War II. We'll have to make the transfer before those people wake up. Relax. They'll find themselves sitting on an empty 747 wondering what happened, and we'll be halfway to South America. Yes, I'll speak to Mr Stevens. Phil, Herb Corrigan. We have aircraft and ships heading to the point where the 747 disappeared. - I'll be waiting right here. - You're welcome to join us. We're monitoring the coastguard search too. I'll get out there as quick as I can. Thanks, Herb. Nayy Search Base, this is Nayy Search Three. On station. Over. Navy Search Three, this is Navy Search Base. Roger. Out. Nayy Search Base, this is Coastguard Cutter Venture on course to search area. Navy Search One, this is Navy Search Two proceeding to Sector Charlie. Over. This is Navy Search Four proceeding to Sector Delta. Negative sightings in Alpha Sector. Out. - Any chance of them spotting us? - Not a chance. We're headed away from them at 600 miles an hour. I'd better help Banker. Thank you. This weather front's going to limit the air operation's effectiveness. We need more ships. Get me CINCLANT Fleet Operations. Stays. Oh, yeah. What is it? What the hell happened? Jesus Christ. Bonnie? Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie. Come on. - Oh, my God! - Face the rear of the plane. - What's happening? - Put anything solid behind your back. - Get down. - Back inside. Just take it easy. Jesus Christ. Give me a hand here. Move it. Move it! - Is it broken? - I think it's broken. - Kid, take it easy. - All right, honey. - Oh, my God! Bonnie! - She's OK. - Don't move her. - Keep her still. Oh, my God. Look. Look! Look. Look! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Hold on! Look out! Don't panic. The emergency lights come on automatically. - The life jackets! - No! Forget the life jackets. - We can't open the door. - We're gonna drown. - Nobody is going to drown. - Have you radioed for help? Radios don't work underwater, but they know exactly where we went down. - What if we run out of air before... - Calm down. I said calm down! Everybody. People are seriously injured and they need our help. Get pillows, blankets, sheets, anything that will make the injured more comfortable. - Where's that Dr... - Williams. Here, Captain. There's a little girl that's pretty bad off. Put a tourniquet on this man's arm. See if you can move that piano. Give me your belt. Goddamnit! How could you let a thing like this happen to us? - How could you? - Stan, give me your belt. Don, what in hell happened? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. You check the damage. Sir, could you hold this tight? Every five minutes let it go and then do it again. Sir, I'm gonna need a little help. Can you come with me? - Will you be all right here? - Of course. Go with him, Nicky. Thank you. The children, are they all right? Yes, they're fine. Now, you just lie back and let me take care of you. Oh, Jesus, no! Where's Benjy? Oh, God! He's down below in the main cabin. He is all right. - My God. What's going on here? - We crashed. - We crashed? - Yes, we crashed. People down below are seriously injured. We've got to help them. - I'm too frightened. - We're all frightened, but we can't show it. We're gonna have a panic on our hands. The people down below need your help. So do I. - I'll try. - You'll do it. Come on. You'll be all right. Oh, my God. OK. - Do you need any help? - Yeah. Help me get this bastard into the office. How badly is she hurt, Doctor? She has internal injuries, how extensive I'm not sure. Let's put her over here. No leaks so far, but it was never built to withstand this much outside pressure. - How long will it last? - Who knows? Till the rescue units get here? I hope. Somebody... help me. Christ, Mr Buchek. I'm glad to see you. My God. Give me a hand with that. It's gonna hurt a little, Eddie. Hang on. - Easy. - Ow! - You said it was only gonna hurt a little. - You got a knife? - Take it easy. - Hold still. This won't hurt. I'm only gonna cut your trouser leg. But hold still, please. You got it? Oh, Jesus! - Oh, boy. - That ain't good. - Just lie still. - We need some help. - I'll get somebody to help you. - See if you can find that doctor. His pupil dilation's fine. It's probably a concussion. He should come around. He's got a hell of a lot of explaining to do. Doc, you come with me. - What's the condition of the fuselage? - Doc... Eddie is in the communications room. His leg is smashed to hell. See if you can help him. It's not good. Why don't we put on the life jackets? - How is he? - OK. - I'm gonna need your help. - Sure. Let's see if we can find a bottle of whisky. Karen, it's going to be all right. I promise you, it's going to be all right. Don't leave me just for a minute. Just don't leave me alone. But there are injured people who need help. Well, you're supposed to take care of me. I mean... What's going to happen to me? I'm sorry, my dear, but... the doctor needs me. No, it's back aft here. There. There we go. Let's see what we got here, now. Electric storage cell, no. Interrupted service. Here we are. CM-1, CM-2... CD-1. That's it. Oh, my God. Oh, boy. Look at this. - It's cold all the way to the top. - Completely flooded. Better check the rear cargo holds. Do you want some more water? - Yeah, please. - OK. - Julie? - Yes? I love you, Julie. Here. Steve. Steve. - That doesn't seem to be flooded. - Seem? Let's hope you're right. - Looks dry. - Yeah, for now. How long can she stand the pressure? Who the hell knows? I just hope it doesn't slide down any deeper. Any increase in pressure'll crush this fuselage like an empty beer can. And the lack of a fresh air supply, oxygen, that could become a very big factor. Captain, the copilot's regained consciousness. - Mama. - Yes, darling? Is Bonnie gonna die? No, love. She looks real sick. I know, but she's gonna be all right. You'll see. Come here. Is that all of it? - Just about. - Just about. Coastal radar did have a fix on us before the crash, didn't they? No. We were too low for radar interception. It's fortunate that you are injured, you miserable son of a bitch! I'd take you apart... Get him down below. Come on. What did you mean about the radar? Chambers flew us off course. The search planes'll never look for us here. - There's no chance they'll find us? - We're on our own. And that is the total situation as of this moment. I'm glad you came down here. I'll act as liaison between my company and the nayy. I'll bring Mr Stevens up to date. Phil, let's take a walk and get some fresh air. Do you think there's a chance, Joe? Between the nayy and the coastguard, there are twenty planes and six ships out there. The area where they think the plane went down is covered. The search is expanding. So far they've come up with nothing. If there are survivors, they're gonna find 'em. My daughter and my grandson are on that plane, you know that? I have a picture of her here. - She's a beautiful girl. - She is. I only hope there'll... there'll be a miracle and I'll have a chance to see her again. They'll just keep searching, Phil. They'll keep searching. - Go ahead. - OK, I'm through. Would you move, please? - Please move. - Hold on. - Julie, dear, would you move, please? - Come on. I got him. Let go. How is he? It's a bad fracture, but I think he'll be OK. You don't sound too sure. Although there are similarities, this isn't my usual line of work. You see, I'm a doctor of veterinary medicine. I look after the horses at Mr Stevens' racing stables. Maybe we ought to keep that to ourselves, Anne. Whatever you say, Doctor. This way. Where is it? Right here. Ah, here we go. Where is the E-15 circuit? The E-15 circuit breaks right through the bulkhead right here. Oh, God. I'll be right back. - It's started. - How bad? - Bad. How we doing here? - Take a look at 57-W. What's the matter? Listen. Did you hear that? No. I don't hear anything. Everyone be quiet for a second. Listen. - What's that sound? - Quiet. Listen. - It sounds like a ship. - They're coming for us! - Thank God! - Thank God, they're coming for us! - It's gone. - It can't be. It just can't be. How could they leave us like this? How could they? - I don't know. - Lisa... I know. Because they never even saw us. It's a passing ship. They didn't even know we were here. - That's enough. - Nobody does. - I said that's enough! - More than enough, Mr Gallagher. Goddamn mess we're in. I think it's time we took a crack at this. Is she any better? Her temperature's gone even higher. Isn't there something we could do? E-15... Here. Let's see. Yeah, that's E-15 all right. - Can that circuit be jumped? - Well, sure, it can be jumped. But what worries me is whether that bulkhead can withstand the pressure. If we don't get a man up to send a mayday signal, they'll never find us. You're right. Some choice we got. Either we all drown or we all suffocate. Come on. OK, everybody. Quickly, please. Settle down and listen very closely. This raft has got a small built-in radio that activates when the raft hits the surface of the water. It's gonna send a distress signal. On the surface of the water? A lot of good that does us down here. Well, you're right, aren't you? We have to get the raft out of the plane. One door opens in, in the rear cargo section. - We can open it electrically. - Won't that flood the plane? No. There's a sealed door between the cargo hold and here. If the bulkheads don't give way, that's the only place it'll flood. I'll be in the hall with this oxygen. If I can get the raft out, get that damn thing up and inflated, the search parties'll hear it. - That's about it. Let's go. - Captain. - I think I should go with you. - No. I'm an experienced scuba-diver. Two men have a better chance of making it than one. He's right, Don. Go up in the cockpit, get another one of these rigs and join us. It's in the starboard locker. Get a couple of life jackets. Put that wire on the blue terminal. OK. - How much more? - Not much. Just one more wire. Nothing I say will make any difference. Why? Let the pilot go. Why are you taking a chance? - I'm doing this for all of us. - We're us! They're a bunch of strangers. You think everybody is us. Can't you forget about other people and think about yourself? Other people thinking about themselves got us down here in the first place. You've got a lot of brains, Martin, but you're not a smart man. Help me off with this. Careful with that one. - You've got it. - OK. Now... I touch those together and that should do it? - That ought to do it. - Then we do it now. Look, we have a date tonight in Palm Beach, so you take care of yourself. Promise. There really isn't much more to say. There's a hell of lot more to say. There just isn't time enough to say it. You all set? Get up against this bulkhead and stay as flat as you can. When that damn door opens, you're gonna think the gates of hell came open. We've only got two minutes of air. Here we go. What's wrong? Must be a short in one of those damn wires. Don't get too close to the door. Mrs Wallace, come away from the window. Lay her back. Get her something to drink. Look. He's made it. Here, have some more. Easy. Here. Come on, drink it. Take it easy. OK, Frank. There you go. Easy, now. All right. Easy, Mrs Wallace. We have a beeper! Nayy Search Five, this is Nayy Search Base. We have an emergency beeper at 27 degrees north, 65 degrees west. - Proceed and investigate. - This is Nayy Search Five. Wilco. Out. 200 miles off course? That's incredible. - What ships are in that area? - Agerholm and Cayuga. - They're not part of our operation. - They are now. Get me Admiral James at CINCLANT Fleet. - And check the coastguard. - Aye aye, sir. Isn't there something I can do to help? How's your breast-stroke? - Mrs Wallace? - I have to leave. Why? If you open that door, you'll hurt a lot of people. Please, don't... Don't do that! God! Stop it! Take your hand off that door. Listen to me. Stop it! Someone help them! Oh, my God! Look at that. There it is. Hey, looks like we've got a survivor in a raft. Come on, baby. Come on! Yes! Yeah! Give me a wag! Atta way! Navy Search Base, this is Navy Search Five. Over. This is Nayy Search Base. Go ahead. Have located the aircraft at coordinates given. One man in a life raft. No other survivors sighted. - Aircraft is completely submerged. - Is the fuselage still intact? - Roger. Appears to be. - I want this to be a first-stage alert. Get me helos, scuba teams, compressors, air-hose packages, the works. I want this treated like an emergency sub-salvage operation. Get me the captain of Cayuga on a voice circuit. - This is Captain Guay. - I'm sure you know why I'm calling. Yes, sir. We're prepared to take that man on board. We have a UDT team, but we'll need additional equipment and more divers. - What is your ETA? - Less than half an hour. I would like to embark the aircraft owner on Cayuga. Do you concur? - We'll be happy to have him aboard. - Thank you, Captain. Phil, we can get you out there by helo immediately. You too, Joe. No, I'll be of more use here, Admiral. They're gonna need the specs on that plane's stress points. Get Mr Patroni a direct line to his company. And he'll need to be in constant contact with Cayuga. - This way, Mr Patroni. - We'll get that plane up. And in one piece. - Buchek. - We've got to move Dorothy. We're going to have to move her. Get her in the back of the plane. Quick, move it. Don't worry. I got her head. - Hurry it up. - Easy. Take it easy. Sir. I have contact out there, sir. OK. Lookout reports we have a life raft off the starboard bow. Come right and prepare to put a boat in the water. - Aye aye, sir. Right, full rudder. - Aye aye, sir. Lower the stern ramp. Thanks. Am I glad to see you guys! Hang on. Here we go. Raise the stern ramp. Don't let it slip. Stand by. Let's get down there. - Mr Gallagher, the pilot. - Are you all right? - Yes, sir. I'm fine. - What's the situation? Most of the passengers are alive, but that fuselage is gonna give way. - Air? - They've been down there too long. We'll get this rescue operation going. Get him some dry clothes. - Thank you. - Main line. Aye aye, sir. Eve, Powers, come here. Distribute these to the passengers. - One at a time. - They slip over the head. Make sure they're secured tightly. As far as the other stress points go, watch out for sections 5-B and 9-L. They can't take much torque. We're keeping a line open at this end. Don, I don't need to tell you the risk factor of getting the plane up in one piece. It could split wide open at any time. Take care and good luck. Thanks, Joe. - My daughter and grandson... - They weren't injured, sir. We're gonna raise the plane with salvage pontoons. Lieutenant Norris will lead the UDT team. - I'll go with them. - You a diver? - Amateur. - I'm not sure I can permit that. Your men don't know the stress points of a 747. Attach the pontoons in the wrong place, that ship'll crack wide open. You need me down there. Get this man into some scuba gear. Right this way. - Grab the stern line. - I got it. Stand clear of the airline. I got you. Play it out easy. Hook it up. Easy does it. The main damage is in the forward cargo hold. Can we get air to the passengers? Too risky. You can't cut through that thin aluminum. OK, let's get going. The captain's gotta be kidding. He thinks we're gonna attach some air balloons to that 747 and it's gonna float right up to the surface. - It's gonna blow up like a bomb going off. - They gotta try something. Those people'll die from lack of oxygen. Don't bet anything on their chances with this balloon routine. - All set, sir? - I'm ready. All right, let's go. Over the side. There's divers out there. They're coming for us. - What did he say? - Where? I can't see them. Move over. There they are. They're gonna try and raise the plane. It's gonna be like a tidal wave. Grab anything solid you can get your hands on. Grab that companion-way rail. Use your belts. Strap yourselves in. Doctor, get that child up here by the pong table. Move it out. Come on. Here, grab this. - Here's number one line. - Number two. Got it? OK, take it on down. Captain Guay. - Go ahead, Norris. - Plane's leaking like a sieve. - Gallagher says it's now or never. - What about the weight distribution? It's gonna come up at a steep angle. - Any way to equalise the load? - No, sir. Let's get those boats out of the way. We're gonna have to chance it. Let's go. Hold on to me, Dorothy. It'll be all right. The boats have pulled back a safe distance. We can start. Start the compressor. Reduce the air pressure. We can't afford to lose another one of those. Martin, help me! Nicky! Hold on! Nicky! Benjy! Somebody help him! I got him! It's all right. Hold on to me. Increase the pressure. My God. Get ready! We made it. Let's go! Better get those people out fast. That plane could go down as quick as it came up. You're safe. You're going to be all right. Dorothy? Dorothy? Let's get out of here. Take your shoes off! We'll disembark in the following manner. The injured first, then the children, women and finally the men. - Give me the girl. - I'll help with the child. I'll take the kid. Watch out! Inflate your life jackets before getting out! Wait for the boats! Come on in! All right, step on it. Let's get 'em on that boat. - My leg! - Take it easy. Oh... God! Put her over there. Come on. Careful. Careful! Sir. OK. Get them in life jackets! Go! Take that one off! - Frank. - Chambers is dead. Oh! Ow! Go ahead! Eve! Eve! Eve! The cockpit! Come on! - No! - The cockpit! I can't! Stay there. Come on! Jump! Grab me. Watch her head. Be careful. Benjy. I'm your grandpa. - She's gonna be all right. - Thank you. Easy, Eddie. Cold? I... I'm warming up. You'd better. You got a date with me tonight. I love you. I love you.
