Uh, so as my gift to her, I'm bringing down the barrier once and for all! (GASPING) Mateys, we ride with the tide! - Yeah! - Yeah! (GASPING) Fairy Godmother. Bring down the barrier. I most certainly will not. I am your king! Obey him. (GASPING) Ben's been spelled. Ben. Uma found your spell book. Just look at me. Ben. Ben. - Look at me. - No, look at me. - You love me, remember? - No, you don't. - Yes, you do. - Ben, look at me. Bring down the barrier now! I do not take orders from you! Ben? Ben, I never told you that I loved you because I thought that I wasn't good enough. And I thought that it was only a matter of time before you realized that yourself. But, Ben, that's me! I'm part Isle and part Auradon. Ben, eyes over here. And, Ben, you've always known who we were - and who we can be. - Don't listen to her. Ben, I know what love feels like now. Ben, of course I love you. Ben, I've always loved you. (GASPING) Mal. True love's kiss. Works every time. - Ugh, give it to me! - No! Guards, seize her! No, no! Stop, please! Stop! Uma, I know you. You are so much more than just a villain. And you have to believe me, because I've been there. Do not let your pride get in the way of something that you really want. No, no! Uma! BEN: Uma!

I owe you guys so much. - Yeah. - Really. - Yep. - You got that right. - Just a little bit. - If there is anything that you need, or anything I can do for you... Um, actually, there is, Ben. I know a girl who would really love to come to Auradon. It's Drizella's daughter, Dizzy. She's like a little sister to me. Then she should come. Okay! (LAUGHS) Okay, great! Actually, um... (LAUGHTER) Ben, there's a lot of kids who would really love it here in Auradon. Kids just like us, who also deserve a second chance. Can I maybe get you a list? Yes, yes! Absolutely, please. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Great. M'lady Mal, we found your spell book below deck. Uma had it. Ooh. Um... You know, this seems like the kind of thing that belongs in the hands of Fairy Godmother. Fairy Godmother? That's me, thank you. Mm-hmm. This belongs in the museum. It does, yes, and I'm gonna take it. Go for it. (LAUGHTER) I'm not gonna be needing it anymore. (GASPING) (LAUGHS) Aah!
