Just before Pap died He told me that I'd be fine as long as I never depended on anybody but myself I made Pap's grave just like he had done Mama's. All I had to remember her face was one picture Pap kept. but I can remember in the bed at night keeping me warm from the other side Pap said people passed on and came back as some kind of animal that the old part of them would float around like smoke and a person could burn letters and talk to them that way He said my momma was a yellow finch now. I mostly thought of her that way I was 11 years old and Pap said he taught me everything I needed to know about living in the forest When it came to fightin', he said he figured I could whip someone 3 times my size.. but he mostly talked about the government said they were after us said they'd always be after us and one day a war would come and I'd have to fightem and be ready to die for what was right Pap look! What's that Pap? -What are they doing Pap? - Making a road. Why? Who are they, Pap? I don't know. Fill up the canteen. I'm going into town. Yeah. Bring some vegetables for us to sell? We don't have time for that. Fill up the canteen like I told you. Pa, I did it! - How are you, Ali? Moon? - George - What you two have for me today? - Nothing. What's going on with the dozers? I hate to tell ya, Ali... Heard that a lawyer from Birmingham bought up a big track from the paper company. 12,000 acres - They're going to build a big huntin' lodge. - What else you know? Oh, not much, just what I heard from a couple fellows come in here to buy coats and such... Do I get to buy anything? Pap! You keep up, you hear me? Nothing was ever the same after the bulldozers came. Even though I watched his face, I didn't know what Pap was thinking anymore. Sometimes it was like, he didn't know I was there. A couple weeks passed before the bulldozers grew silent. We started hearing the hammering. which made Pap even more nervous. He got upset over the smallest mistakes. Alright. We made one more trip to Mr. Aberscotti's store when the vegetables ripened in the fall That was the last time Pap left the forest alive. Ahh, South America's Andes. lt and it's ...fringing islands... - are basically a jagged... - Stop reading outloud. You're old enough to read to yourself now. Pa! Pa! Help me! Pa! Help me! Tell me again why we live out here. Because you never ask for anything. Nobody ever give us anything either. Go on. Because of that... We don't owe anything to anybody. Who it that thinks we owe them something? The government. I'm not gonna get any better. What are we gonna do? I'm not gonna make it. You're gonna to die? - When? Tonight? - No. But soon. This leg is gonna get infected What will I do? The paper company that owned this land was too big to notice us out here. But that new owner is gonna find you. and he'll send the law. You need to leave here, Moon... and go find other people like us. Most of them are out west, in Montana, Colorado, Wyoming. Alaska's even better. A man can still homestead in Alaska Find a place where nobody can find him. You gonna have to find your way up there, son. - But how... - You'll figure it out. You can't rely on me anymore. You just remember what I taught you. And don't you trust nobody. If you get lonely, you can write me smoke letters. But how will I get answers from the smoke? I want to burn that picture of your mom and put me and her both out of your head. You'll feel lonely for awhile... but it will go away if you ain't carrying things to set it off. How will I get anwers from the smoke Pap? You just do what I tell you, son - I don't want you to die! - Shut up my boy, you don't cry. You hear me? You'll be alright. I don't want to hear anymore about it. After I buried Pap, I felt the lonliness he told me about crawlin' up my stomach and up into my throat. lt didn't seem like anything that would go away anytime soon. Dear Pap, I'm gonna start for Alaska tomorrow. Maybe you can talk to me soon. Pap! Pap! Wait, Pap! Pap! Pap! Easy now, easy. I not gonna hurt you. You're the boy the store owner told me about, aren't ya? Where's your father? I buried him. He's dead. When did that happen? Yesterday. - I shouldn't be here. - Hold on, where do you plan to go? I gotta get away from the law. How about some food? I've got a sweet roll that's sittin' on the counter in there. You stay right here. I'll be right back with it. Take it easy. We're just trying to help. You should've grabbed that boy! Rabbit Pap was right. The law was after me. I'll have to make to Alaska. Where you think you're going, boy? Where'd you bury your daddy? You know you cant just go off buring people without the law involved. I know a thing or two about trackin'. I'll find your stick hut. Ahh, reach for it and see what happens boy I didn't do nothing to nobody! Ahh, quit bowing up to me Now get in the car before I knock you sideways. - Get in the car - No Settle down! Come on boy, get in the car. Get in there! ???? Where are we going? Where are we going?! When will I get my things back? When ready to give'em Can't help but think I'll be seeing you in and out of jail your whole life, boy. Pure bread white trash. Don't need that in my town. People like your pap. Poachin' and trespassin' for a livin'. Don't you ever talk mean about Pap! Ever! Well what ya goin' do about it? That's what I thought. Go! Open the gate Where is your daddy, kid? Man, can you believe it's really him? This way boy. Alright, back on the line, let's go. Thank you Constable Sanders, the boy will be safe in our care. You best put restraints on this boy before I leave. - I don't think he's going anywhere. - I telling you, this kid's an animal He'll be on you like a wet cat you do not tie him down. This is our watchman, Mr. Carter. He'll handle Moon from here. A wet cat. Mr Carter, get this boy a uniform and show him to his bunk. Come on son.

This is not part of the Pinson uniform. Those are your school books for Monday morning. Take them and have a seat. I hear you have plans to run away? Let me tell you about Pinson. First of all, we've never had anyone escape, or bust out as you put it. And second of all, you are now property of the state and will remail so until you turn 18 years of age. Look at me when I'm speaking to you. If, someone comes to claim you, you will be released into their custody. Do you understand? If you behave, you will have no problems here. But any more talk of escape, then your stay here will not be pleasant. - Alight. - Alright what? - I won't talk about it anymore. - Very well. Go put your books away and report to the kitchen to see Mrs. Broomstead to get that hair cut. Don't cut it short. Me and Pap always wear it long in the winter to keep warm. You don't have to worry about that here. I don't plan on staying long. We'll see about that. Better not be any bugs in here. there's no bugs in here. Better not be. - Okay? - Looks good. - Hey. - Hey. I heard about you. You're that boy that lived in the forest. - Right? - Ahhh, yeah. Rachel. What did I tell you? I just said hey to him.

We'll find some woods to hide in til spring. then we'll head for Alaska. Yeah. Will it just be us? We need a big guy like Hal to drive us out of here. Moon, Hal hates both of us. - I'll go talk to him. - But Moon... It was all stuck together. - I ain't mad at you anymore. - I'm not worried about that. I need to talk to you. Alone.

The law's always after me. - What you doing in there? - Kissing her? She wants to give you a good luck kiss. One the cheek. - How long is that going to take? - It better not take long. Come on guys. Let's just go. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. They located the bus and everyone is safe. Yes, sir. Well, all but three. I know. I know. We're doing what we can sir. Yes, sir. I hope you can track him down like he said. I'm about to lose my job. My schedule is pretty busy for the next couple days. This means a lot to me. - A lot. - Well in that case... I might be able to rearrange my case load. Just do what you gotta do. I'll tell you you what you gotta do. You gotta treat and animal like an animal. That boy needs dogs on him and a leash to bring him back with and then, you've gotta put restraints on that boy like I told you when I first brought him. Okay. From this point forward, we're gonna do things my way on my terms. - Goodbye - Goodbye Let's go Snapper, find him. Find him boy. Come on! Let's go to work. - How much further? - We can not stop now we gotta get to where nobody can find us. - All right, Kit? - I'm fine, Moon. Come on. Let's go. - When do we eat? - Soon. Quick, dogs! Come on guys, quick. We gotta cover our steps. There you go boy! Come back here Snapper! Snapper! Didn't work, it's heading up the creek. Crap! Now what? You two go hide in the bushes! - What about you, Moon? - I'm gonna fight it. Fight it? Hell, you can not fight a dog! I ain't going back to Pinson and neither are you. Come on, Kit, do what you whatever you want. Watch your head. Stay! Stay back! Stay! Stay! Stay back! You're a good dog, come on. Come here, boy. - No, stop it! - We gotta do something! - That dog's killing Moon. - Get off me! Get away from me. Help! Somebody help! Ahhh...heel. - Get him off of me! - You're okay, he looks like a Nice dog. Stop! Some bloodhound. He wants to stay with us. Yes he does. That's a good boy. Snapper! Get back here, you dumb blood! Snapper. Davy Sanders, Gainesville Alabama Sanders is out there and his dog doesn't like him either. - Who's Sanders? - The Law. Great, now the law's after us. That is good, they'll have a hard time finding us way out here. - Look Hall, I did it! - Great! I'm just waiting for the food part of all this. - I can feel him, he's somewhere around here. - Yeah. Put it over there by the light, I think he's moving. - Oh gosh, that's so cool - Told you I'd catch something. - Yeah. What kind is it? - A catfish - You were hungry, weren't you boy? - Hey, he sure does like you Hal. Yeah, well, I ain't one to be mean to dogs. You feel better now that you ate all that fish, don't ya? - It was pretty good. - I thought it was great. Enjoy while you can. See how long you can last out here without your medicine. I don't need my medicine Hal. You'll find that you're so... *****************check book? what he'd say???? How'd you get to Alabama anyway Kit? I was sent from Boston to live with my Aunta Montgomery. by the time I got there, she'd... she died. Then I got sent to a hospital again in Birmingham well then they took me to a place in Selma. You know, I was in the hospital for so long, they just never sent me back. That's what they call real property of the state, Moon. So are you Hal... From now on, you guys won't have to worry about any of this any more. I'd been fine if they'd just let me stay with my daddy. I mean, he may have been drunk all the time, but is the best dad there is. You know, I just don't want to go back to another hospital ever again. I don't want more needles in my back. And I don't want my hair falling out. Do not worry, Kit. Just figure another half day before we start looking for places to make permanent camp. We just gotta get ahead of Sanders first. Do you think he can make it all this way, Moon? - Not really, no. - Good Night - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - What's that? - It's a pig trap. - For trappin' wild pigs. - Pig trap? Moon, does that mean they're people around? Nah, too over grown. Hasn't been used in years. But maybe we can clean it out and use it again. Wild pigs are awful good eatin'. - There look, puma tracks. - Pumas? Moon, you gotta be kidding me. First wild pigs and and now pumas. They won't hurt anything our size. Pap said they need at least 30 square miles of territory. So...that means we're far from any people? We'll make permanent camp on the south side of the ravine. Then we'll start our training for Alaska. - Oh, thanks. - Here you go Moon. Ohh, thank you. That better not be rain. We'll finish making the shelter tomorrow then we'll make traps to catch food. - and then we'll... - Shut up, Moon! Ummm shoot! - Hey Moon. - Looks good. Where's Hal? He left. Where'd he go? He said he was going home to live with his daddy. Home? How long has he been gone? Hal. Hal. Hal. Think Hal's gonna make it? Hal's gonna make it. He's got that trackin' dog. They'll find their way back. I just wanted to see his daddy. I know. I want that too. I'd stay here no matter what. This is where I wanna be, Moon This is called a 4 trap. The animal is walking along, goes for the food and... Dead. Dinner. But you have to cook it. I'm still working on the fire. Ahh. Well right now you gotta help me get this up. Good. - Kit! He's out there, I saw him! - Who? Sanders. He's tireing out for someone to come find him. I think he's been lost out her all this time. Whatta we do? We get his gun and then we get rid of him. Moon! - What? - We can't kill him. He's a police man. I ain't gonna kill him. We're just gonna whip upon him some. Now, you go get some really long thin sticks while I go gather some leaves. Whoa Hey! Whoa whoa whoa! Hold on there little buddy. You best hand me that pistol before you hurt yourself, ya hear? Huh? You're causing me a lot of trouble, boy! That's a five hundred dollar gun boy! If I catch you boy, you're done! Get back here, boy! Get back here, boy! So...you finally give up do ya? Yep. You're just too darn smart for me Constable Sanders. Come on, arrest me. Ahh. I'll get around to it. First...you need a little ass whippin'. Yeah! Just wait till I get out of this! By then we'll be miles away and you'll be too busy itching and scratching to chase anything. Huh? That's poison oak. Nearest way out of these woods is that way. A highway about 6 miles away. If you hurry, you can just about make it before dark. You come back here. You come back here, boy! Come on. Kit was quick to learn everything I taught him. It got to where I had to show him less and less. With all the game we trapped, we had plenty of food. - This is so good - I know I reminded him, that when spring came and the cold winter moved on, we'd head to Alaska. The weather was warm most days. I'm figured the worst part of winter was over but I'm wrong. Here, this will keep you warm. Thanks. I'm gonna go get you some medicine. Hang in there, buddy. Here Kit. Eat this. It will make you feel better. Hey, Kit. Thanks, Moon I do not want you to die. - I'm okay - You''re not. I'm gettin' you out of here...tonight. We made it Kit. We'll wait here for help. They'll come and take you to get more medicine. I will be waiting out here for you here, Kit. I'll bust in under the new way. What's happened here, son? Get him his medicine. - Counts good. Mic check, 1,2,3,4. - Sounds good. Yesterday the boy they call Alabama Moon brought one of its two other escapees from the Pinson Boy's Home to this place for medical attention. The sick boy is now being treated at a Tuscaloosa hospital. It's belived that the third escapee, Hal Mitchell, is still at large with Alabama Moon in the forest behind us. Moon Blake was wanted for evasion of the law and, attempt of murder of a police officer. This is Nancy Cynder, Action 4 news. We're good. That was perfect, Nancy. Yeah. Sounded good. - What are you doing in there? - Waiting for Kit. - Come to live with me again? - No, I got my daddy with me. I ain't never seen such a critter. Boy they're huntin' you all over. Better get in here. But I told Kit I'd wait for him. Hell, you're gonna have a long wait radio says they got'em in the hospital stuck full of all kinds of stuff. It's okay, Moon, he's just gotta get back on that medicine. I mean we came out here to warn you about Sanders. He ain't lettin' up on you. You need to find someplace else to hang out for a while. I ain't afraid of Sanders. He's been on the radio saying that you shot at him and ate his dog, Moon. - But I didn't do that. - I know. I've been drawin' down of my savin's trying to feed that bloodhound. Come on. Here it is Moon. Home Sweet Home. - Wow! This is great! - Yeah, just like the Beverly Hillbillies. - This is where you live? - Yeah. Whatta ya think of that Moon? Amazing! This is all yours? Me and the bank. Snapper! Show him around, Hal. Here it is. Wow! It's really nice! Let's get you cleaned up. - Hey, Moon, come on. - Whatta ya doing? Get in. You ain't the only one who knows about stuff. Faster! - Whatta ya think of this? - Most fun I ever had! I gotta chain saw too. Bet you've never used one of them. Let's go get it! Here you go, boy. Yeah, it's a touch easier than killin' your own food, ain't it Moon? Yes, sir. I can ride around in clay pits and use chain saws, and eat hamburgers, for a long time before I get tired of 'em. Don't hurt yourself on that burger boy. He always eats too much when you give him regular food. You got anything I can write a letter to Pap with? I thought he was dead. He is but I write a letter, then burn it so he can read the smoke. Moon, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard of. You don't mind do ya? You can do what ever you want around here? There's writtin' stuff in the kitchen drawer. Dear Pap I know it's been a long time since I've written anything to you and sometimes, I wonder if you really get these words in the smoke seeing has how I don't ever hear from you. and I've made some decisions that I don't know that you'd really like. I've decided not to go to Alaska at all if I've gotta be alone. I just don't think I can live up there like you wanted me to live. I'd be too lonely, Pap. Why did we have to live up there like we did Pap? Why couldn't I have any friends? I just don't know what to do. I'm not mad at you. Love, Moon Where's Snapper? He likes to sleep with my dad. What happened to Rachel? She only lives about 10 miles from here. When I drive over, she usually sneaks out to meet me. We can go over there and see her tomorrow if you want. That'd be nice. But first I want to stop off and see Kit. I told you. We gotta wait till he's better. Probably won't let anybody in with him right now anyway. You know how he hates those hospitals. Sure he hates dead a lot more. Hal? What Moon? I think my Pap was wrong about a lot of stuff. Wanting to live out there in that forest? No, I like living in the forest. I don't know where else I'd be. I just don't want to be my myself. Me and Pap were always by ourselves. - I'm a little tired. - I'm not. I wanna try and see Kit. Can't it just wait a couple of more days? - I can't. - I told you we gotta wait He doesn't like to be alone. - Please. - Fine then. Well...better not get my ass in to hell though. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Thanks for getting me out of Pinson. Goodnight. Don't stay there too long. People start asking questions, get the hell out of there. I ain't stayin' around if the cops start pouring in here. - I don't want you to. - Good, cause I ain't. Be careful. - Umm...where's Kit? - Who? The boy that was out in the forest. Oh, him. He's in the intensive care unit. And, how do I get in with him? That's not allowed here. Just wait, right there. Wait, wait! Kit! Kit, it's me! It's me. I knew you'd come for your little friend. Just let me see him, I just want to talk to him. He doesn't like the hospitals. Oh, it don't matter anyway. He's still out like a light. You seem to have lost your spunk. You can't do anything to me that matters. I don't got anywhere to go anymore. Oh, you've got somewhere to go. We're gonna have a whole day of fun, you and me. Get out. This isn't Pinson. No...you're going to be beggin' for Pinson by the time I'm done with ya. First, you're gonna show me where you buried your daddy. Then, I'm gonna kick that smart ass attitude out of your hide. What's going on here? Police matters. Requiring a dog leash? Listen Slick, this is none of your b... This is your fault! Get the hell off of my property. Now! What's your plan now? I've been thinking about it and if Sanders can't get to me, he'll go after Kit. Did you do everything the constable said you did? - No! - I believe you. What I've seen of the constable, he's a bully and a bigot. And a liar. Well you've damaged his pride, and he doesn't take very well to that. Moon, I feel responsible for a lot of what happened to you. I spent my whole life... defending our legal system sometimes it just doesn't work out very well. You needed...something else. You could've let me stay, and live out there in your woods. All by yourself? Moon...I'm gonna try and help you. I'm gonna get this map and you're going to show me where everything happened right from the beginning. Alright now, we are... here. Yeah , yeah. I remember going up this trail. - Do you remember this highway? - Yeah, I passed that... We're going to Tuscaloosa. The judge there said he'd be willing to hold you in his jail... while I try and make a a case for you. Okay. And you'll be safe from Sanders. What if...? - What about Kit? - Let's worry about you first Kit's safe where he is. What'ya think you're doing? That boy is supposed to be in my custody. We've already discussed that over the phone Constable... I don't care what we discussed on the phone... - Get your hands down. - Hey, don't touch me. Hey, get your hands off me. Did you talk with Mr. Wellington yet? - I'm not a news service, kid. - But I've been here two days! Hey, kid. Come on. Mr. Wellington sent these over you put them on, and we'll go. Moon, get out, come talk to us. How are you felling? Do you have a lawyer? Are you scared? Go in there and sit with your lawyer, son. - I thought you'd left me. - Quiet! You don't speak unless you're given permission, you hear? Yes sir. Now, we've got an unusual situation here. and because of that, I've closed this hearing to the public. And I got a headache and those people out there are driving me crazy. Moon Blake, you have stirred up quite a commotion here... and I don't like the commotion. and I don't like people who shoot at our law enforement officers and I don't like people who eat other people's dogs. Sanders is a liar! Hey! Did I ask you a question? No. Okay then, let's get started. Come on up here, Constable Sanders. - You're not gonna lie are ya? - No Your Honor. Alright. Go on then, let's hear your side. Well, I sent my trackin' dog after the boy He caught the dog and must of ate it. When I caught up to him, he shot at me. Shot at you with what? A pistol. Where'd he get it? He stole it from me. He stole it from you? I took it. I threw it in the lake I never shot at you! Well, the kid admits he took your gun away from you. How in the heck did that happen? - I dropped it. - You're a liar! I snuck up on you and I took it. Hey! You want me to gag you boy? Hush. Okay. That all? Ain't that enough? Get up here, Wellington. Good morning Constable. Morning Slick. Contable Sanders, how many times did the boy fire at you? Oh, at least 4 or 5 times. I'm lucky to be alive. I didn't shoot at him. Constable Sanders, is this your service revolver? Well, it looks sorta similar. The serial number matches the county record. This is your gun. I had it retrieved from the pond where the boy said he through it. Notice You Honor, the gun still contains six rounds. This gun has not been fired. How do you explain that Constable? Yeah Constable. How do you explain that? Well, I... Constable Sanders, how long have you been a law enforcement officer? Fifteen years. And never had any employment or part-time work outside the profession? No. In fact, if a constable were to accept money for favors that would be considered accepting a bribe, would't it? Hey, wha wha what are you trying to pull here? So you've never done any work, or favors, for the Pinson Boys Home? Not that I recall. Then why, would the Pinson Boys Home have any entry to you in the cash log for $500 on the very same day of the escape? Me and the director are gamblin' buddies. Constable, you better hope this ain't going were I think it's going. Your Honor, I would like to introduce some witnesses. Yeah. Bring'em on in. - Hal! - Hey Moon. Hey Rachel. Your Honor, I would like to introduce Mr. Mitchell, his son Hal, Rachel Gene, and Snapper. Constable Sander's dog. That's a damn lie! No, that's your dead dog. Slick. Sit back down Constable. What's wrong with you? Why would a grown man act like this over a kid? Not only have you lied to me it seems mighty suspicious that you've accepted a payoff. He did! He got Daddy to pay him to go after Moon. I got the cash log for Mr. Wellington Bennet, put this red neck hick in my jail? And call the Livingston PD and tell them he's been reassigned - to the state penitentiary. - You can't run a trial like this. - I just did. - Get your hands off me! I told you he was a liar! Hal Mitchell, am I lookin' for you? Yes sir. I guess you realize this is your last stop before Helen Wyler? Sir, I know. Kid, what am I'm gonna to do with you? Your Honor, ironically, all the publicity surrounding the case has brought about an unexpected bit of good fortune. Relatives have heard of the boy's flight and have come forward I spoke to the boy's uncle this morning.\ and he is eager to adopt Moon. Uncle? Well, where's the uncle been, while this kid has been raising cane all over Alabama? They live in Mobile Your Honor. The family has been searching for the boy and his father for years. They are very thankful that Moon has been found. Seems like a nice man, and a very nice family. Moon! Behave yourself. It's great, Moon. I ought to woop you good for doing what you did today They were gonna find me anyway. Well Moon, I am proud of my boy. - He done the right thing. - Let's go, Hal. - I love you, Dad. - I love you, son. - Bye, Hal. - See ya, Moon He's a damn good boy. Well, Moon, you call if you need anything. um...I've gotta go too, Moon. My mom's waiting outside. Will call me on the tellephone when you get to Mobile? - Bye Rachel. - Bye. Can we go see Kit now? Can you help me with a patient? A young boy about his age. His name is Kit. I was afraid you might have gone back to your old ways again. - Hey, I need some stuff to write with. - Yeah. - Will this do? - Yeah. Sure you don't want to come inside? - No, I'm okay. - Okay. I understand. I'll leave the light on if you change your mind. I started in telling Kit all the things I had planned for us. All those things we never got the chance to do together. Fish we never caught, traps I never showed him how to make the places we never saw. And all the things we missed out on doing together. I guessed Kit would want to know these things. So I told him how much I missed him. and how I'd always think of him. as my best friend. I'm sorry, Moon. I'm so sorry. Kit's all alone up there now. I know. And Moon... it's not your fault. The doctors told me. Your friend was very sick. He wasn't ever going to get well. The nurses told me, all Kit could talk about was his adventures out there in the woods the weeks he spent with you. He had the best time in his whole life, out there with you. I miss him though. - I miss him so much. - I know. And it's okay that you do. Hey Moon. I'm your uncle Mike. Hey. I don't remember you. Well, we've been lookin' for you. And it's taken a long time, and I'm sorry about that. - You ain't mad about this? - No, I'm not mad. You got a whole bunch of family down in Mobile all excited to see you. Thank you for all you've done, Mr. Wellington. Pap was wrong about you. You are a good person. Well there are a lot of good people out there Moon. I'm sure you'll find that out for yourself. - You ready? - Yeah. Bye, Mr. Wellington. Come and visit us. Yeah, I get down that way. Well I guess you're my new Pap, right? I could never replace your Pap... but... I would like for you to think of me that way, yeah. So you came and looked for us? Yeah, we went lookin' for ya. Your dad just... he kinda disappeared. He didn't leave a trace of where he was going. Why did I we live out there like that? Why couldn't I have any friends? Well... maybe that was what he was running from, huh? Moon, your dad... just kinda did his own thing and went his own way and he didn't trust most people. I think when your mom died, he took it pretty hard. - I lost a good friend too. - Yeah, I heard about that. I'm Sorry. You know, Moon? The important thing... is that, you don't have to feel like he did. Most people don't. Moon, this is your Aunt Sarah. - And this is Alice. - Hi. And this is David. - Hey. - Hi. Alice, tell him about your mean hot chocolate. Come on. - Hey buddy, you okay? - Yeah. I was just going to write a smoke letter to Kit and Pap telling them where I was, and how nice things are here. But...I don't believe that smoke letters really work anymore. I bet they know. Don't you think? I bet they know. You know Moon. We don't expect you to just slide into everything here. It's a lot to get used to. especially coming from a background as different as yours. We'll just take it slow. I just know everything's gonna be fine. - Right? - OK. - Can I make hot chocolate? - You bet you can. It's cold out here.
