IT'S WHAT HAPPENEDTHE NIGHT SHE WAS CAPTURED. SHE WOULDN'TALLOW IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. WE'LL TAKEA FIVE-MINUTE BREAK. I CAN'T GOTO PRISON, NORMAN. I THINK SHE WAS JUSTSAYING THAT YOU COULD, BUT YOU WON'T. THAT'S WHAT I GOTOUT OF IT, ANYWAYS. I MEAN, IFANYONE'S IN TROUBLE, IT'S PROBABLYTHAT STEVE GUY. I HAD YOU VETTED. IT'S WHAT WE DOAROUND HERE. AS IT TURNS OUT, YOU'RE WHAT WE CALL"A SOLID CITIZEN." OH, WELL, I TAKE THATAS A COMPLIMENT. I'M COMING TO SUSPECT THAT PERHAPS YOU ARE ONE,AS WELL.
