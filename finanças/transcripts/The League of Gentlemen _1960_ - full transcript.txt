Banco, darling. Wake up, darling. What's happening? Are we being raided? No, that's the one thing we've still got to look forward to. Come on, baby. Sit up and have some nice brekky-wekky. - Did we? - No, darling. I wasn't thinking of that, for once. What I was struggling to say was, prop me up, darling. I know you're not allowed to prompt the contestants, but, was last night as bad as I remember? - Worse. - Oh. - We didn't do very well, yes? - Correct in the first part. Cleaned out? You are correct in the second part. You've just won a fabulous weekend with no expenses paid in glamorous Notting Hill Gate. Have some coffee. Never has a house lost so much, so consistently, to so few. The lease is up here, old darling. - What now? - Meaning me? Don't worry, I'll be all right. There's always a spot for me in the south of France with dear old Bertie. "Bonjour tristesse" and all that. I can always close my eyes and think of England. - What about you? - I'll take the bottles back and collect the pennies on the empties. Not to worry. Something always turns up. Like me? No. Not quite like you. It's a pity this isn't deductible. We'd make a fortune. I'll go and run your bath for you. Cooperative Removals, Limited? Did you open this? No, no, no, I'm listening. Well, that's very nice to hear. No, I'm not promising. No. Well, you ring me later and find out. Bye. Run some more hot in for me, will you? I'm your husband, not your bloody bath man, you know. - There is such a word as please. - Please? Aww, poor Rupert Bear, he's all upset. Now say you're sorry, like a good little bear. Ah ah ah. You've had your porridge for this week. Who sent you your lovely book? Why do I have to answer all the questions? I might ask you who was on the telephone just now. Well ask me, darling, I might even tell you. You want it all ways, don't you? I just face facts, darling. The war's been over a long time. Nothing's rationed any more. There's plenty to go round. - I had a bloody good war. - Yes. Perhaps you ought to go off somewhere and find yourself another one. You never know, you might get a mention in my dispatches again. - Yes? - Oh, you're in. Good evening, Mrs. Boyle. I've been waiting for you to come in. You know you've had callers this afternoon, two gentlemen. Oh? Who was it? - Did they say? - No. Never left no name. Oh, I expect they'll call again? Yes. They said they'd be back. Probably something in connection with the magazine. Didn't look like no church magazine to me, Father. Looked more like the police, Father. Oh, I expect it will sort itself out. Most grateful, Mrs. Boyle. - Redcliffe Gardens. - Thank you, sir. Don't tip him, I took care of it. You took care of me, too. I'll call you, baby. Martin? Darling, is that you? Who were you expecting? Where did this come from? I don't know, darling. I haven't opened it, have I? That must have killed you. I'll get you some breakfast. No, I had breakfast. Well, don't just stand there. If you've got something to say, say it. You phoned the Paradise, right? And they said I'd left. Well, I went to a party, a very dull party. I think I'm getting my job back, so you'd better dust off the piano and I'll start practising again. Okay? That satisfy you? I didn't say anything, did I? No, you're improving. Martin. Darling, don't be too awful to me. It's only because I love you so much. Well, I'll be especially nice to you this afternoon, let you buy me a present. We'll have dinner together? Yeah, we'll have dinner together. It's not from your wife, is it? No. Hi. Hi. Nice-looking job. Just running her in. Which one? It's not ostentatious, is it? No, no, not for you, no. What's that one's gimmick? Oh, the little, she sings. She's a singer. Just made her first recording. On extended play, no doubt. Well, what's your other problem, Dad? No problem. Just got a little job for you. The same as last time. Well, I don't know, I mean, you know, I did it once to help you out, but it's taking quite a risk. Well, I could up the ante a bit, maybe. Another five? Don't rupture yourself, will you? I might be interested in 25. - Do me a favour. - That's a favour. Hurts, don't it? It's in the boot. How do you want it fixed this time? Just lengthen the odds a bit, like 110 to one. With a 10% jackpot. Are you sure that's enough? Don't they ever twig it? No, they love punishment. People are greedy, didn't you know? - Have it ready for tonight. - Hey! I'll take that phone number when you're ready for a trade-in, you know. You couldn't even afford the down payment. Ah... Okay. That's it. Go take a rubdown, huh? Mr. Stevens. I told you not to come here. Yeah, well, necessity knows no manners, as they say. I've got nothing for you anyway. I told you last time, that's the lot. Things have been very slack. Yeah, I know, it's the same for everybody. One gets through it so quickly, especially if one has a hobby. I mean, they say girls are expensive enough, but, well, it takes all sorts to make a world. When can I expect something, then? I told you I haven't got the money. End of next week, shall we say? Don't leave it any later. We want to keep everything nice and friendly. I'll look in again, then. I'll send it to you, if I get any. No, no. I prefer the personal touch. I'll call in. You'll get it, don't worry. I've got every confidence in you. What's the matter with you? Do you want to catch cold? Get down there and get a blanket on. What's this like, then? Any good? No idea, I haven't started it yet. The last one you lent me wasn't much. Nothing happened, did it? I mean, I didn't understand half of it. What were them two blokes up to, then? I mean, if you've got to read a book like, I like them others, you know, plenty of thrills and that in them. Well, there are thrills and thrills. Frank! It's on the table. Let me see those X-ray plates again, Nurse. - Nurse! - I'm sorry, Doctor. - The plates. - Yes. Concentrate, Nurse. - You're new here, aren't you? - Yes sir. Well one thing to learn, at St. Matthew's we never let emotion get the upper hand. There. There's the patch. There. It's spreading, too. Frank, are you there? Oh, you are. Look at him, lapping it up What's happening tonight, Daddy? What's happening on there? Is the little girl still in the iron lung, is she? Yes, and they're all dying. He loves it. Have some gravy. The doctor came today. He thought Daddy was looking wonderful, says he can go on for years, the way he's looked after. Of course, he said he'd never have lasted as long as he has, if he'd been put away. You're a miracle, Mrs. Weaver, a miracle. Oh, very nice to talk to, the doctor was. Well, I said, "Frank wouldn't think of having Daddy "put into a home, after all he's done for us, "giving us the business and all that." Oh, he looked at my veins today. He said I'll never get any better till I get off my feet more. There was something I wanted to tell you. What was it, oh yes, Mr. Wilson at the garage, his son, you know the young one, Raymond was his name, no, that's not his name, the other one what was married to, you know, the one that was married to the girl that used to do my hair. You remember, they said the baby wasn't his. Well, according to... Come on, chaps, we haven't got any time to lose. Co-operative party? This way, please. Do I say thank you to anybody? No host? - Oh well. - The liquor's genuine, anyway. I know you, don't I? I don't think so. Are you a member of the Paradise Club? - The what club? - Paradise. Not to my knowledge. Well, they spelt my name right, anyway. Found yours yet? Yes. We may as well swap cards, save intros. I think I'll... Oh, you're not leaving already, I hope? You'll miss a rather good lunch. Just the hat and the umbrella, please. Oh, good morning, gentlemen. You've all found out where you're sitting, I take it? So shall we? Good. Over there, Rupert. That's right. Oh, one absentee, I see. Well, we won't wait. I chose the menu with rather more than usual care. It'd be a pity to spoil it for one defaulter. What's that? Oh, good man, you've found some. Excellent. Did you have any trouble parking? I didn't come by car. How very sensible. This is good, absolutely at peak. Well, don't you agree? I don't drink. Oh no, of course not, I forgot. Well, do start, gentlemen. Good God Almighty. This is the right place, the Co-operative whatnot thing? Yes. Do come in. We were just about to begin without you. Oh, I took the wrong turning, and not for the first time. I found myself in a room full of trade unionists cooking up the next wage claim. All Tories, of course. Didn't take to me at all. Ah, that's better. What is it? Hmm, fair enough. The '52's all gone, I suppose? Enjoy your meal, gentlemen. You know the old saying, If a rich man, eat when you will, if a poor man, when you can. Waiter. See we're not disturbed. Leave it to me, sir. Well now, gentlemen, I think the first thing for me to do is to establish my good faith. You'll find these contain the missing halves of the five pound notes. Captain Porthill. Captain Mycroft. Lieutenant Lexy. Major Rutland-Smith. Captain Weaver. Captain Stevens. Major Race. Don't bother to thank me, gentlemen. Purely a business transaction. Be a bit difficult to thank you, anyway, old darling, since I don't know your name. Didn't I sign the letters? How very careful of me. Well, I've no objections now, I don't think. My name's Hyde, JGN Hyde. What's the J stand for? - Jekyll? - Well, that's a thought, isn't it? Mr. Hyde? Corporal? Sergeant? Let's just leave it that I outrank you. The book, gentlemen, I'd like your opinions on it. You've all read it, I take it? I'm afraid I didn't, old darling. Any particular reason why not, Major? I never read books from strange men. Well then, a very brief precis for the Major's benefit. An American thriller with the germ of a good, almost brilliant, idea, about a group of single-minded men who plan and execute a particularly daring bank robbery. Right? Now, any criticisms as to the way the robbery was organised? You're asking me? Well, I thought it was quite original. - That's all? - Yes, that's all. Weaver? I think I agree with him. I'd like to read it again. Quietly. I see. Stevens? Oh, I enjoyed it. A bit far-fetched, perhaps. You couldn't see it happening in real life? Oh, I wouldn't go as far as that. Life's always surprising me. But didn't it excite any of you? - Mycroft? - Well, I was held by it, yes. Nothing more? I mean, weren't you actually excited? No, I can't say I was. I prefer more subtle things, really. But didn't it give any of you any ideas? It gave me a headache, I read it in bed. Yes, but what about the basic idea, the way the robbery was conceived, like a textbook military campaign? Didn't that fire your imaginations? Apparently not, old darling. Well, you disappoint me, gentlemen. I expected more of you. I felt sure, that at the very least, the idea of making easy money would appeal to all of you. What makes you so sure of that? Oh, come now. You're all crooks, aren't you? Well, one kind or another. Wouldn't you agree with that, Padre? I'm not staying here to be insulted. Oh, I would, if I were you. After all, we're all men of the world. So an officer who was cashiered for gross indecency in a public place, the Botanical Gardens, Tunbridge Wells, wasn't it? Needn't feel squeamish. And then, of course, you took to the old dog-collar racket. What denomination are you at the moment? Church of England? Oh, no, no. No, that stopped at Bristol, didn't it, at the assizes? I felt the judge went a bit far, myself. Still, you're here, and I'm sure you're going to stay. You seem amused, Mr. Lexy. Is it a joke we can all share? Well, you tell me. Well, I can't tell you the same joke, I'm afraid, but try this one. It has a certain charm. Berlin, 1945. Lieutenant Edward Lexy, Royal Corps of Signals. Kicked out for giving information to the Russians. The joke being that you did it for money, as always, not principles. Not funny? A bit near the knuckle, perhaps? Depends whose finger's on the trigger, doesn't it, Captain Porthill? Yours was in Cyprus, when you were cashiered for shooting EOKA suspects. He's still using those nimble fingers, though, playing the piano in cheap nightclubs and extracting pocket money from middle-aged ladies for services courageously rendered. Race, ex-Major Race, with his customary foresight in these matters, which did him, and at the same time kept him from justice, resigned his commission, just before a flourishing black-market ring was uncovered in post-war Hamburg. A decent gesture, though. For the sake of the regiment and all that. Breeding will tell, you know. Friend Stevens. One-time fascist back-room boy, Mosley speaks and all that. Saw the light just in time and was made an officer and a gentleman. Unfortunately, he couldn't quite behave like one. The Sunday newspapers had a field day. There's nothing the British public likes better than catching the odd men out. Captain Weaver. A sad case, but not demanding too much sympathy for the Captain. Save your tears for the men who died as a result of his gross negligence. Four, weren't there? Members of a bomb-disposal squad, acting under Captain Weaver's orders, while he was acting under the influence. And, of course, gallant Major Hyphenated Smith, we mustn't forget you. You always wanted to die with your boots clean, didn't you, Rupert? But marriage changed all that. His wife's money bought him out, after she'd settled some embarrassing mess bills. However, gratitude, as Nurse Cavell omitted to add, is not enough. And where do I fit in? Well, I'm ashamed to say that I have the advantage over you, gentlemen. My criminal career is just about to blossom. You'll find nothing on me, not a blemish. I served my country well as a regular soldier and was suitably rewarded after 25 years by being declared redundant. Now, don't let's kid ourselves any longer. This was not intended to be a book of the month club lunch. I've brought you all together because I have a certain proposition to make. Now, what do we all have in common, apart from an urgent need for funds? We were all trained at great public expense to do certain things with the utmost efficiency, such as how to kill a man with the minimum effort and other minor arts and crafts, which, while frowned upon in peacetime, are acclaimed in times of war. Well, I've got a social conscience, and I think it's a crying shame for so much public money to be wasted. I intend to put it to some practical peacetime use. Now then, the main character in this book knew just where to lay his hands on the various experts to do the jobs he wanted. Well, you are my experts. You were all specialists in your own fields, and, with your cooperation, I intend to rob a bank myself. And the pay, gentlemen? 100,000 pounds each. That's $280,000, 1,100,000 Deutschmarks, over 100 million francs, if any of you are thinking of emigrating, and it could be more. How do you know? Have you counted it already? How do I know? How did I arrive at all of you? Because I make sure of all my facts before I move. I've put in a good deal of time and money on this project. I'm giving you the benefit of both. And which bank have you in mind? That's restricted at the moment. And this, gentlemen, is as far as I'm prepared to go for the time being. Think it over carefully. I hope no one will try to be clever. Such a waste of time. I shall deny everything and a year's work will go for nothing. It could be a year well spent for all of us. How do we contact you? I'll do the contacting. I'll let you know when and where we meet again. - Same terms? - But of course, Mr. Lexy. Oh, do drink up while it lasts. Everything's paid for and the room's yours till four. Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's been a pleasure. Well, speaking purely personally, old darlings, I thought that was a bloody good lunch. I do hope he hasn't the National Provincial in mind. They're being awfully decent to me at the moment. You want to get those potholes filled in, old darling. Bloody near ruined my springs. I had them dug especially for you. Sorry if I went round the houses this afternoon. Very boring for you. Why, was it as obvious as all that? I wouldn't say obvious, exactly. Well, I'm not very good at it, you see, probably because I'm usually the one who's followed. Nevermind, you gave me a certain academic thrill. It was a seven-to-one shot, but my money was on you from the start. You'd like a drink, I take it, before you go - back to the YMCA? - Thank you very much. The butler's night off? I live alone. A bad habit to live alone, old darling. Gives one a complex. You were in the catering corps, I see. What's that? You're not exactly Mrs. Beeton, old darling. Oh, one can't be bothered cooking for oneself. I have a good cleanup about once a month. Yes. The point is its home. Do you mind? I'm quite good at this. It's the way I was brought up. Mummy thought the world of me. Soap flakes? Don't think you have to. Believe it or not, this was the one chore I missed in the army. What rank did they kick you out with, by the way? I made half colonel. Still I gather you don't intend to exactly fade away? Let me tell you about me, though. Yes, do. Well, I'm careful the careful type. Came through the shooting match without a scratch. Oh, blokes queued to stand beside me at Dunkirk. Not luck, I just took care. Rule one, ask first, be a hero later. So I'm asking, why should you want to lead me to the biggest amount of loot I've ever heard of? Because you're one of the experts I need. To be successful, an army has to be mobile. That means a good transport officer. You used to be as good as they come. Oh, this has still got egg on it. Oh, I'm so sorry. And what about the others? I'm glad you asked me that. What did you think of them, by the way? Well, not nature's noblemen, perhaps. No, but as a team, all hand-selected. I wasn't exactly idle during my last few months at the War Office. You'd be surprised what a little research in the files brought to the surface. No, not surprised, because you came floating up. Floating? I got everything I wanted. Weaver, genius with explosives. Lexy, the radio king. Mycroft, absolutely first-class quartermaster. And the other three? Good trained soldiers, ruthless if need be. And what's your speciality? I synchronise the watches. And go over the top first? I shall be there on the day. Well, remember rule two, old darling. Never get ahead of the mob. They're liable to shoot you in the ass. What you need someone to protect your interests. Yes, that had occurred to me too, but before you suggest yourself for the job, I ought to mention one thing. Everybody gets the same share. - Well, roughly, anyway. - No. I intend to get away with this, and the one sure way to disaster is for somebody to get greedy. So it's equal shares for all. - Including you? - Of course. Do you still want to be considered? Well, you haven't yet told me how you hope to get away with it. That comes later, when we've reached an agreement. As you say, one has to proceed carefully. I was at Dunkirk, too. Yes, but I bet you didn't get away on the first boat, like me. Of course, there's always the possibility, ugly though it may sound, that I might spill the beans, if we don't come to an agreement. And you said you weren't nasty. Oh, I'm not, it's just the way my mind works sometimes, you know, in vicious circles. Yes, but you're not the informer type. I'm sure that we can find a mutually acceptable solution. I'll tell you what, let's have something to eat. We'll talk about it. What, two meals in one day? You're spoiling me. All my men loved me. Well? In theory, I like it. It has a certain old-world charm, but it'll never work. Why not? Because you can't pull a stunt like that in this country. Oh, I know they get away with it in the States. The first ones to try it here will get away with it too. Think of it as a full-scale military operation. What chance has a bunch of ordinary civilians got against a trained, armed, and disciplined military unit? You were a soldier, man, you ought to know. You know, we really are a marvellous nation, aren't we? In any crisis, we always produce the right man for the job, even though it's the wrong job. All right. I'm sold. I'll sign on for the duration. On my terms, equal shares for all? Well, if you insist on this socialistic nonsense, yes. You're losing a friend, but gaining a second-in-command. I'll settle for that. Oh, let's leave the dishes. Do you want to stay the night? Why not? Well, move in now, if it comes to that. - Fine. - Good. Did you bring any gear with you? Yes, always prepared. You'd be surprised where my caravan has rested. Well, I'll just pop out of the car, old darling. Look, do you mind not using that sickening expression? Oh, what's that? Call me Hyde, Norman, or Colonel if you like, but for heaven's sake, drop that old darling stuff. All right, old dear. Sorry, Colonel. One gets into terrible habits at the YMCA. - Is that your wife? - Yes. - Is she dead? No, no, I regret to say the bitch is still going strong. Very smart. I shall miss the old Rolls, though. Yes, so will I, but she didn't fit the part. Well, we mustn't keep them waiting. - The Cafe Royal again? - Not this time. We're at war now. Robert was dancing principal and I was, charming! Can I help you? We've got this room until three. Isn't this Babes in the Woods? No, we're rehearsing Journey's End. - Oh. - So sorry. - Well, where do we go? I haven't the faintest idea. You'd better sort that out with the secretary. Only asking. Some people! Shall we start with the second act? I'm sorry about that. Well, now, gentlemen, if you will all look at page 20. Let me say how delighted I am to see you all again, gentlemen. Your presence here restores my basic disbelief in the goodness of human nature. So I think perhaps the time has come to dispel any further doubts that you may have, the Babes in the Wood permitting. Priceless! Absolutely priceless! Fabulous! Don't you think it's a great idea? Yeah, I have to admit it is. What a concept! You think it's got a chance? Oh, you're bloody marvellous I think, can't miss. By Jove, yes, be like the old days. - What do you think? - Yeah, give it a try. Are you ready to vote on it? How about you, Padre? Yes, I feel a certain calling towards it. - Weaver? - Me too. - Stevens? - I'm for it. - Splendid! Well, thank you for your support, gentlemen. Now, our immediate plan is as follows. After dismissal here, I suggest we disperse and you take tender farewells of your nearest and dearest, and then report to this address at 1800 hours tomorrow, and come prepared for a long stay. Decent accommodation, of course, sir, as befits officers and gentlemen? Well, the food will be good and the prospects unlimited. Of course it's not goodbye, darling. I mean, after all, we've only just been introduced. It's just that I'm onto a good thing. It's a big opportunity for me, which I hope you will share. Here. Have this one on the house. I'm just passing through myself. Excellent. Well, it's good to see you all on parade. Now, if you'll follow me, gentlemen, I'll show you to your quarters. Some of you will have to double up, I'm afraid, but we must all make sacrifices at times like these. Oh, and by the way, I want to appoint two admin officers. Captain Mycroft, I propose making you quartermaster. Oh, thank you, sir. And of course, we shall have to have an adjutant. Major Race is the senior man, I think. Will you accept, Race? - Well, if you insist. - Right, gentlemen. Weaver and Porthill in here. Keep an eye on him, Porthill. Don't let him sneak any liquor in. Excuse me. Mycroft and Rutland-Smith in here. No noise at night, now, while Christopher Mycroft is saying his prayers. Mr. Lexy, you're along here. Oh, good. On my own, eh? No, with Stevens. Major Race, you're through there. Thank you. I feel at home already. Like being back at school, huh? I sincerely hope not. Can I have you all out here again, please? There are just one or two other things. The usual offices are down there to the right. I've posted various duty rosters for fatigues, et cetera, and I should like them strictly observed. You will make your own beds and be responsible for your own laundry. And no women in the rooms after 10, I presume? Or before. Now, regards discipline, where they apply, Queen's Regulations will be enforced. Any minor breaches will be punished by a fine of 100 pounds to be deducted from the final payout. Major or repeated offences by a fine of 500 pounds. Well, I think that's all for the time being, gentlemen. Dinner is at 2000 hours, followed by our first lecture in the basement. Could you spare a moment, Major? I hope you're gonna hold church... "Operation Golden Fleece." I like that. Cookhouse duties and fatigues? I don't care for that. I see you and I are washing up tonight. How delightful. And I'm cooking lunch tomorrow. Well, press on, I wonder what time lights are out in the dorm. I don't know about you lot, but I'm going to keep my lights on all night. You may smoke if you wish, gentlemen. We are gathered here to discuss phase one of the operation. Now, I don't have to tell you that, as a general rule, banks take very good care of people's money. They are not going to give it to us, so we shall have to take it. But to take it, we shall need arms, and the sort of arms we need are not sold over the counter. However, I have every confidence that whatever we require will be supplied by our late employer. Do you mean the army, sir? First slide, please, Major. Certainly, Colonel. I'm so sorry. That comes in the second lecture, How to Live Off the Countryside. Ah, that's better. Gentlemen, you're now looking at our source of supply, the Army Command Training Centre at Mulverton in Dorset, to which we will shortly be paying a surprise visit. Oh by the way, just one other little detail. When we leave our card, we shall have to provide the authorities with a scapegoat. In this case, I'm relying on the British character. We British will always give the Germans, the Russians, the Japanese, or even the Egyptians the benefit of the doubt, but never the Irish. So, throughout this exercise, if we use our accents judiciously, the IRA will get the credit and the blame. Have a fag, sir. Don't let the other ranks see you're nervous. Cut it out, Martin. Now. 51st Training. Yeah? - Who, sir? - Area Command? I've got the G2 on the line for your commanding officer. Is something wrong with your line? - The old man's out, ain't he? - Yes. He's gone out of town shopping with his missus. Well, I've got a call for him. Well, put it through to the adjutant, clot! Just trying to find him, sir. Well, hurry it up! Bighead! - Hello, Captain Saunders? - Hello. I've got the G2 on the line, sir. Who, man? Speak up. The G2, sir. Oh yeah, I'd better take it. Putting you through, sir. Whom am I speaking to? Captain Saunders? Well, I wanted your commanding officer, my dear fellow. Not there? Oh, that's most unfortunate. Look, I've got a bit of bad news for you, I'm afraid. Yes, the new Area Commander's on his way down for a surprise visit. Someone's been complaining about the food. Complained about the food? Well, no, no, I don't... Well, how do you think I ought to handle it, sir? Well, with kid gloves, if you want my tip. He's a ball of fire. Well, put on some sort of a show. Yeah, the best I can do, I'm afraid. Yes, well, sorry I couldn't give you longer notice. Thank you, sir. We're very grateful to you, sir. Thank you. Goodbye. Wilkins, get my stuff, hat, belt, everything, then get Mr. Thomas and Mr. Shotter, no, forget that, I'll do that, you just get the stuff, go on! Yes, sir. Hello, get me the Orderly Room. Get me the Orderly Room! Attention. Lieutenant Chalmers report to... - Bernard. There's a flap on. - Sir? The Area Commander's on his way here. There's been a complaint about the food. Now we've got to get things organised. Right, leave it to me, sir. - Paul, go with him, will you? - Right. Full guard turnout. Jimmy, don't stand there, trot along to the switchboard. Try and locate the old man. Lieutenant Hall, what have you got for the men's tea? Friday, sir. Fried eggs, baked beans, chips, toast, tapioca. Yes, can you change it? Not now, sir, it's all cooked. Right, rustle up some soup and give every man two eggs. Have you got any tinned fruit? Some n the officers' mess, sir. Well, grab it. Put that on, too. Corporal! Two eggs? Muckin' balloon gone up or summat? It's a diabolical dead liberty, I tell you. Still, tinned fruit, eh? Oh, aye, that'll make all the difference. The bleeding stuff's been here since the Boer War. Come here. What's the matter with your webbing, Alpers? You're on a fizzer in the morning! Get me 428. - Can't, sir. - What do you mean, can't? I can't get a line, sir. - Well get the exchange, then. - Can't get anything, sir. Here Chunky, come on, all outside. Get moving! - Get stuffed. - Get what?
