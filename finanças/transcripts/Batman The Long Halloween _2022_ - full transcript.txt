[distant sirens] [Bruce] I only came here out of respect for my parents who... knew your family. Your father... was more than just a friend to my family. [Bruce] That was a long time ago. [Falcone] Yes. A long time. Thomas Wayne believed in my father. He believed a man could bring order to a world of chaos. And you, Bruce? I believe in Gotham City. - You try the vongole? - [woman] Mm. Delicious. - [windows shattering] - [people shouting] [tires screech] [people murmuring] [people cheering] [sirens blaring] [laughing] [siren blaring] [laughing] [tires screeching] [both grunting] [water splashing] [inhales deeply] Oh. Hmm. [silenced gunshots] [crickets chirping] Master Bruce. Happy Halloween. Is there coffee? In the study, sir. A Miss Kyle telephoned. She said she was checking the number you gave her to make sure it's real. The gates are open. We haven't seen a trick-or-treater in years. We won't see one tonight. Hardly worth the security risk, wouldn't you say? Respectfully, sir, if our security is dependent on $600 worth of iron alloy... This city is fallen, Alfred. Then we must endeavor to lift it up again, Bruce. In the meantime, we live in obstinate hope. And an unlocked mansion. Anyway... it's an absurd holiday. Oh, yes. Putting on costumes and striking fear. Quite absurd. Do you really think... I hate when he does that. - [crickets chirping] - [distant sirens] [children giggling] Whoa, whoa, whoa. James. Babs! No running! Come on guys, slow down! You're gonna hurt yourselves. They're excited, Jim. Big night. Yeah. All right. But we're taking the squad car. Too many crazies out. [Babs] Sir! Hang on. Now you're ready. All right, who wants to drive? [Barbara] Jim! [laughing] Just joking. [telephone ringing] Hey, hey, hang on. It could be a wrong number, or a crank call or... [clears throat] Gordon. Uh-huh. When? All right. I'm on my way. Your father's Captain now. The whole department's counting on him. Well, I was counting on him, too. [sighing] I'll try and be quick. [children chattering] Hello? Gilda. There you are. What? [sighs] Harvey. You're home. Better late than never. Why are you hiding out here in the cold? I know. I'm sorry, I-I just... Mm, you started without me. Did you have any kids? What? Trick-or-treaters. Oh, no. I... No. I just... I don't think I'm really up for all that tonight. Answering the door every five minutes... smiling. Yeah, I saw the bowl on the porch. It's okay. It's a ghost town out there. [chuckles] So to speak. We're gonna be eating that candy for a month. Or not. You know I have a love-hate relationship with candy. You have a love-hate relationship with everything. [sighs] Let's just crawl into bed and watch an old black and white movie on... [Harvey] Baby, I'm so sorry. You have to go. Pick a movie. I'll be back soon. I love you. [distant siren] [door opens] Does he always keep you waiting like this? He'll be here. I thought you quit. I have. Hmm. Don't worry, I won't tell Barbara. [Batman] Gentlemen. Ah. Good. This is District Attorney Harvey D... Bats. Dent. Okay. What's happened? Johnny Viti was murdered tonight. Damn it! [Batman] The Roman's nephew. He has a name. It's Carmine Falcone, not "The Roman." [Gordon] Harvey, calm down. Where were your men, Jim? I've been working on Viti for months! Nobody on your team thought he'd be vulnerable the night before he's gonna turn state's evidence? .22 caliber, taped handle, serial number filed off. [Gordon] Baby bottle nipple for a silencer. Odd, but effective. And untraceable. Hard to tell if we're dealing with a professional. Of course it was a professional! This was Falcone! He found out Viti was gonna betray the family so he took him off the board! Maybe. [sighing] We were so close. We were so close, Jim. He was ready to sing. And not just about Carmine, the whole family was going away. We had a real opportunity to change things. We still do. It's just a setback. We'll find another way to take down Falcone. Together. [Batman] Where's the jack-o'-lantern? Excuse me? You think it's important? I don't know yet. Look, Harvey's right. This city's finally got a chance. And it's the three men standing here right now. The Falcone crime family has to be taken down. So I'm putting you two together. District Attorney Dent will work in the light, and you... will work the other side. Bend the rules, but never break them. And I'll do everything I can to protect you both. Understood. [Harvey] He needs to hear you say it, Bats. Two heads are better than one. [Batman] Leads come my way pretty fast. Keep your ears open. Then I guess we're up and... running. He does that a lot. - I just... - [door opens] And I'm talking to myself. [woman crying] [clears throat] Godfather. I'm so sorry to hear about your nephew. Grazie, amico. [Antoni] Carmine. No disrespect, but why are we sitting on our hands here, huh? He put two in Johnny's head! Who did? Salvatore Maroni! Who else? Ever since he took over that family, he's been gunning for us, and tonight, he found the target. It's a warning, for Christ sakes. Perhaps. But let us be clear. The man who pulled the trigger did not load the gun. Maroni's ambition was in check until the law put a target on my back. Now it's open season. If anyone is responsible for my nephew's death, it's that new son of a bitch in the DA's office. Dent. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Maybe he should sleep with the fishes. [murmurs of agreement] Hell yes! You just say the word, Carmine, and I'll do Dent myself! Settle, Antoni. At the right time, we'll hit back. Until then... The right time is now, Carmine! Now! Any delay is only gonna make you look even weaker! Thank you for your concern, Antoni. No... no disrespect, Carmine. It's "Godfather." [grunts softly] Milos. Come on! [Antoni straining] Please! [groaning] [breathing heavily] Milos! No! No! [thud] We have other business to discuss? Alberto? Alberto! Business time. Take your crosswords for a walk. They're... logic puzzles. Thirty-two going on thirteen. [all laughing] [Falcone] Wayne is not gonna support any large-scale structuring effort. So, for now, the assets will have to be moved to a more secure facility... [thunder rumbling] [yawning] [groans] Your equipment's weighing you down. Why are you running? Fun. You could use a little fun. [grunts] Give me your hand. Nah. [grunts] [Batman grunts] Got you exactly where I want you. [Batman] Falcone. Wait till you see what's inside. Mm... [laughs] Have you ever seen this kind of money? It's authentic. So crisp and clean. Actually, it's incredibly dirty. Falcone's been having trouble laundering his cash for some time. We just didn't know where he was stockpiling it. Thank you. I'm happy to help. Why? You could have kept it to yourself. You could have lived pretty well with all this. Why hand it over? To you? Who knows. Get down! [grunts] Take it from me, pal, around here, curiosity can get you killed. [Batman] Let him go. What? Why? Because he's with me. Also because he's the DA who put all your friends into Arkham. We got room for one more. [hissing] [Batman] Anyone follow us? I could barely follow us. [device beeping] [whistles] Falcone Imports has been doing quite a business. You know, if we were any other men... We're not. Yeah. No. Of course. So, what now? [Batman] We should call Gordon. Have his men pick this up as evidence. Falcone owns the mayor and the entire city assembly. It'd be back in his coffers by tomorrow. [Batman] So the only way to make an impact is to make it disappear. Yeah, but look at all this. Moving it could take days. Well, who said anything about moving it? Why are you trying to hurt Falcone? Why are you? It's not personal, sweetheart. It's justice. Justice can be personal, sweetie. Give me a head start. I don't want to get caught anywhere near here. I don't know. Gordon says I'm supposed to work in the light. Well, then, light it up. I owe you one. You owe me like... a billion-five. I can't really be a lawyer and a criminal, can I? I want to win. But do I want to win like this? I'm of two minds here. So it's a coin flip. Yeah. I guess it is. Heads, we burn it down. Okay. [sirens blaring] Call Chen. [bats screeching] [news anchor] Firefighters on the scene here in the Industrial District working to contain the blaze before it can spread to nearby homes and businesses. Now at this time, Jackie, officials believe the Falcone Imports warehouse, owned, of course, by the notorious Falcone crime family, to be vacant... [coin clinking] [chuckling] "Two heads are better than one." [engine starts] Gilda? Gilda? Hey! You scared me. I came home and I didn't know where you were. Did you hear me calling? Please stay. I'm not going anywhere. I mean it. Don't leave me. Baby, I know I haven't been around. And I'm sorry. But this job, it isn't forever. Hey, we caught a huge break tonight on this Falcone thing. Once I take him out, and I will take him out... things are gonna be different. We can start a family. You know I can't. Of course you can. We can. We'll talk about options when you're ready, but I need you to trust that we're still on track. And that I love you. Now are we still having movie night or not? No, don't even answer that. Come on. [car alarm blaring] [dogs barking] [sirens blaring] If we take 66th, we can cut them off at the Westward Bridge. No, maintain a safe distance for now. - [horn honking] - [tires screeching] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [beeping] Good evening, sir. The turkey is roasting, the pies are cooling and Miss Kyle is en route. [rapid gunfire] [Batman] Alfred, make a note to order a new windshield. Bulletproof. Of course, sir, but if I may... [grunts, gasps] [tires screech] [horn honking] [neon sign crackling] [Mickey panting] [grunts] [woman screaming] [panting] Aah! [grunts] I thought you didn't hurt people! [screaming] You thought wrong. [Mickey screaming] You and your San Ho Hui buddies were seen outside Harvey Dent's house on Halloween. We were trick-or-treating. [Mickey screaming] [groaning, laughing] Having fun? Not yet. But any second now. [Mickey grunts] [grunts] Ya! [grunts] [speaks in Cantonese] [grunting] [laughs] [yells] [groans and grunts] [whimpers] [grunting] [bomb timer beeps] [grunting] [grunting] [groans] [grunting] - [bones crack] - [screams] [chuckling] [yells] [electricity crackling] [groans] [grunts and groans] [groaning] [exclaims] [Cutter groans] [Cat woman] Go. I'll keep an eye on your little friends. A "thank you" would be nice! It is Thanksgiving. [Batman] We can make this easy, Mickey. Just tell me who hired you to kill Dent. Go to hell, Bat-Freak. Right now, the only difference between you and me is that I know what's down here. Hmm. [Mickey straining] Grundy. He's mine. Let him go. [grunts] [Batman] This is your place. Give him to me and I'll make sure he never sets foot down here again. [grunts] You can be alone. [grunts] [grunts] [Grundy] Born on a Monday. [monitor beeping] [Tamara] One more for ya. [Gilda] My goodness. People have been so kind to Harvey. Oh, this one's not for your husband. It's for you. From a "Mr. Falcone." I-I'm sorry, ma'am. - It's none of my business... - [exhales sharply] Isn't it time for his dinner? [door closes] [Gordon] I don't wanna be here, Mick. My wife's cooking turkey with all the trimmings. I love turkey with all the trimmings. So, just tell us what you know about the bomb in the district attorney's house, then we can all go eat. I don't even know Carmine Falcone. The Roman contracted your triad to take out Harvey Dent! Your signature's all over it. Mickey. You gotta help me keep my friend here calm. Just give us something, anything. Someone's trying to frame me. I told you. I'm innocent. Chairs are for suspects. This guy's innocent. [grunts and speaks in Cantonese] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey. I thought we were just doing a thing. This little act doesn't get us anywhere if the guy gets hurt. Maybe you guys should admit you have nothing on San Ho Hui. If you had, you would've booked me already. All right. That's it. Montoya! Please, show our friend out. Maybe you should thank whoever planted that bomb. What did you say? You still haven't figured out who killed Johnny Viti? [chuckles] Get him outta my sight. You may be aces in a fistfight, but you've got a lot to learn about detective work. I found him, didn't I? It's not just about finding them. You gotta know how they're gonna help your case. Mickey Chen is a small fish protected by Falcone. We were never going to get a confession. We needed to make friends and, in time, flip him. Keep talking like that, they'll make you DA. Harvey isn't dead yet. And he isn't a killer, either. No matter what that scumbag thinks. He's never even owned a gun. Falcone fits. The Roman killed Viti and ordered the hit on Dent. Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is usually the right one. All right, if I leave now, I might just make dinner. You should be with your people, too. Fine. Good night. Happy Thanksgiving, Mrs. Dent. Now, I'm sure the missus is running out to pick up some real food, but I guarantee you, you have never had pumpkin pie like... Uh, Mr. Dent? [instrumental music playing] I just wanted to get out of this city, I hate this place. Nice. [indistinct chatter] [Falcone] The secret is the basil. You want only the youngest leaves from the youngest plant, otherwise it's like mint. Overpowers everything. We have a lot to be thankful for, Alberto. Such as? Health. Family. [Alberto] What's left of it. [chopping stops] If you are referring to your cousin Johnny, that is being handled. - [chopping resumes] - By Mickey Chen. And who do you think hired him? [sighs] Of course. Is there something you wish to say? [sighs] No, Poppa. Except to point out that Harvey Dent is still alive. Because I allow it. For now. This. This is what I keep talking about. This is Oxford. That place polluted your mind, Alberto. You used to know your place. Now? I should have never sent you there. The dangers of independent thought. When have you had one independent thought that actually benefited this family? Maybe when I sent flowers to Dent's hospital room in the Falcone name. You did what? I sent flowers. I thought it would take suspicion off of us if we looked like we care about his recovery. Now, I suppose you'll say it was a sloppy move. - [grunts] - [objects clattering] - I can forgive sloppy. - [choking] What I will not tolerate is you presuming to speak on behalf of this family. [choking and grunting] Let me be perfectly clear. Again. Any notion you may hold about being next in line to take over our business interests is a pathetic delusion. [groans] [coughs] [breathing heavily] You are weak. Your weakness is my liability. You are to have zero contact with Mr. or Mrs. Harvey Dent. End of discussion. [panting] [Gordon] Harvey! Hello. I got a call that you went missing from the hospital. How did I know I'd find you here? Couldn't stand being cooped up anymore. Thought I'd stretch my legs. [Gordon] Yeah. Listen, why don't you hop in? I'll take you back. No. No, no, no, no, no. I like it out here. I'm on my way home for Thanksgiving dinner. You should come along. Barbara always makes a ton. I'm not hungry. Harvey, what are we doing here? I don't know. Maybe I wasn't ready for this yet. [inhales sharply] I think I'm gonna go back now. Don't you worry about Harvey. [sighs] All right, Counselor. As far as I'm concerned, you don't have this. The Falcones are dangerous people and, to them, you're the bad guy. Protect your family. [car door opens and closes] [engine starts] [indistinct chatter] So I made him an offer, you know. [all laugh] [glass clinking] To the family. Those dearly departed... and those whom we are fortunate to have beside us here today. Let us be thankful for the time we still have together and for the many blessings bestowed upon us. - Alla salute! - [all] Salute! [people laughing] [man 1] Ah, yes. - [man 2] Oh, look. - Oh, come here! - [man 3] Oh-ho! - [man 4] Yeah! - I told you I'd walk. - [man 5] Very good, very good. - [man 6] Yeah! - [all shout and laugh] - Whoo-hoo! - [man 7] Welcome back. Barbara? [sighs] Ooh! [both laugh] [sniffs] Solomon Grundy... born on a Monday... [laughter] No. Believe me. I told him where he could stick the cape. [all laughing] Even Gordon laughed. That's when they let me go. [laughter continues] [silenced gunshots] [Batman] You don't need me for this. I should be out hunting. [Gordon] We've got it covered. All of Gotham PD will be deployed throughout town by midnight. One way or another, when Holiday comes calling, we'll be ready. You know, this was all you. [Batman] I wanted them in Gotham Penitentiary. This was Harvey. And he was right. Calendar Man. So... a killer who only works on holidays. And it's December 24th. I was wondering when you'd get to me. We don't have much time, Day. Who killed Johnny Viti on Halloween? The same person who killed Mickey Chen and his crew on Thanksgiving. We need a better answer than that. Viti was The Roman's nephew. The Roman was Chen's employer. First suspect is, therefore, The Roman. But since sneaking around isn't really Falcone's style, we move on to the second suspect. Someone hoping for the fall of The Roman empire. Like Sal Maroni. He's as good a guess as any of the others. What "others"? You're down a man. This is a waste of time. I told you to bring Mr. Dent. He isn't safe out there. The DA who put you all in Arkham? Half the patients here would kill him on sight, so I'd say out there is the only place he is safe. Perhaps. Or perhaps he doesn't know you're here. Perhaps... the district attorney... is a suspect? Ah. Well, of course. Intelligent, calculating, with a mission to take down Carmine Falcone. It all fits. Harvey Dent is not a killer. Unless he's leading a double life. Like your caped crusader here. Why did you ask for me? So you could see for yourself. I don't have time for your crazy. [Calendar Man] You really don't. There's lots of crazy out there these days. And just when you thought you'd cleaned it all up. [sighing] What a... joke. Happy holiday. - [Batman] Open it! - [guard grunts] [buzzer sounds] [flies buzzing] [inmates laughing] He had somebody get to my kid! [sobbing] If... If I didn't help him... I'm sorry. Harvey isn't safe. Go! [laughter continues] [Joker] ♪ 'Tis the season To be jolly ♪ ♪ Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! ♪ ♪ Outside It's an awful chiller ♪ ♪ Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! ♪ ♪ Boy, this Holiday's A killer ♪ ♪ Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! ♪ - [door closes] - Gilda? Is that you? "Gilda"! She looked like a Gilda. Looking for this? [laughing] Relax, lollipop! Police issue. Where's my wife? She's just where I left her, last-minute shopping. Spoiler alert, it's socks. What do you want? Aw, I thought I was playing Santi Claus! Oh, all right. I want a fire engine and a football and... to deliver a message. Put the gun down and we'll talk. Sure! [Joker laughing maniacally] [Alfred] Your suspicions were correct. A Santa clown has reportedly terrorized three families today. Sir, they were all named "Dent." [engine revving] [laughing maniacally] - Whoo! - [gun clicking] [groans] [grunting] [Harvey grunts] [laughs maniacally] [groans] Where did you get that? Why? Ya missin' one? [chuckles] You could use some cheering up! Have ya heard the one about the murderous clown that escaped the asylum and showed up at the home of the DA who put him there? See, there's a persistent rumor 'round these parts that DA Dent is more than he appears to be. But there's only room for one homicidal maniac in this town. And if I hear that Happy Harvey Dent is steppin' out, I'll make sure little Gilda doesn't have to clothes-shop for hubby-wubby ever again. You call that a joke? But you haven't even heard the punchline! It goes like this! - [groans] - [laughing] [Batman] Harvey. Harvey, can you hear me? Any idea where he was heading? Maroni... [in Italian] Mangia. [grunting] [thudding] [grunts and groans] What happened to your friend's face, Maroni? Nothin'. What happened to yours? Oh, you mother... Tell me everything he said. If you get off of my neck. [coughs] He was inside before we got there. Took out the whole staff, poisoned the fagioli. I wasn't hungry, but, uh, Freddy here... I dunno. Guess I'm lucky. No. He let you live. Why? Do I look like I know? He put a gun in my face and told me that this is his turf and that he's cracking down on interlopers. Maybe I should thank him. I don't know where you get off. Freaks like this clown used to play way out on the fringe, but once you showed up... Relax, pal. Ya know, things used to run smooth in this town. Now we got killer crocs and moths and sewer zombies, not to mention a homicidal maniac skulking around the holidays hittin' made men. What's the common thread? Huh. Where is he? Who knows? He's a nutjob. But if he's the guy killin' Falcone's men, it's only a matter of time till he gets to old Carmine himself. Maybe start there. Not really much of a detective, are ya? [clicking] Hello. [Joker laughing maniacally] Navy, navy, charcoal, black. Ugh! Really, Carm, is a splash of color too much to ask? Stop clowning around. If you're gonna kill me, just do it. [gasps] Is this the face of a killer? Ugh! [laughs] I guess it is! [laughs maniacally] Oh, relax, polpetto, I'm not going to kill you. Not tonight, anyway. [chuckles] It's Christmas! But... someone will die tonight. Probably someone close to you. Don't you want to know who's pulling the trigger? [laughs] Anyhoo, I just popped in to say, if you hear any news about the Holiday investigation, I'd like you to pass it my way. As a professional courtesy. [in Italian accent] Here's my card! Buon Na tale! - [smooches] - [grunts] [chuckles] Buon Na tale. [chuckles] [in normal voice] Hoo! I kill me. [toilet flushing] What the hell? [laughing] [Joker] Missed me! [Joker continues laughing] Whoo! [snickering] You know what I forgot? [gun clicks] [Joker] Whoa! That was close! [laughing] Whee! - [body thuds] - [Joker grunts and laughs] [tires screech] [bells jingling] [monitor beeps] [Alfred] I would remind you, sir, of Mr. Falcone's "annual benefit for the Gotham Children's Clinic." It would be advisable to show your face at least one year. Your father built that hospital. [Bruce] He helped The Roman build it. [Alfred] Still, a good cause. And, frankly, a night on a yacht could do you some good. Miss Kyle will be there. [sighs] Three murders on three holidays. Each of the victims, a Falcone associate. All shot with the same type of untraceable gun. No witnesses. [Alfred] Suspects? Salvatore Maroni. His family's always been second to The Roman. He's notoriously ambitious. [Bruce] But he's killed Falcone's men in broad daylight. Why the cloak-and-dagger Holiday business? Carla Viti, Falcone's sister. Runs their Chicago operation. She could be making a play for control of the family. [Alfred] By killing her only son on Halloween? [Bruce] She is a criminal. [Alfred] And he is a homicidal maniac. [Bruce] The guard testified that he escaped before the first murder. [Alfred] The Roman himself. [Bruce] Johnny Viti was about to flip and Mickey Chen could testify that Falcone ordered Dent's murder. He had motive to silence them both. But why kill his own bodyguard? May I ask why you're keeping the fifth suspect off the board? [Bruce] Because I don't like it. But it fits. Doesn't it? Obsessed with taking down Falcone. More than boss Maroni and every ambitious made man in town. He was turned down for a gun license last year when the psych eval showed some... wild aberrations. Or is it someone else entirely? Someone we haven't even considered. [sighs] I thought this would be about sweeping criminals off the street, maybe scaring them straight. I never thought the Batman was going to have to be a detective. A good one. What if I can't save them, Alfred? I've seen these growing pains before, sir, and I am confident that, in the end, the Batman will be what the world needs him to be. The same, I believe, should be said of Bruce Wayne. [ship horn blowing] [indistinct chatter] [chatter quietens] My distinguished guests. It is my honor to welcome you here tonight. I see a lot of familiar faces. Mayor. Your Eminence. No, I was talking to Sal Maroni. [crowd laughing] Sal Maroni. On my yacht. It's like my father always said, "Keep your enemies close... and a loaded gun closer." [crowd laughing] [chuckling] Yeah. [Falcone] Thirty years ago, a small group of concerned Gothamites joined together to build something the politicians squabbling in the halls of government could not. Dr. Thomas Wayne and I built the Children's Clinic to protect families. And if you know me, you know there is nothing more important to me than family. So, buon anno! Thank you all for being here and for your generosity. Let's beat last year's total. Remember, cash only, please! [all applauding] Also, I would like to thank our corporate sponsors, Kord Omniversal, Soder Cola, and for the 10th year running, Gotham Broadcasting Company. Oh! Oh... Oh, I'm so sorry! Here, let me. I have it. Thank you. [under her breath] No, thank you. [Falcone] One more thing, and then I promise I'll let you enjoy the party. I would like to acknowledge someone. As I said, nothing is more important to me than family. And perhaps my one regret is making this man feel like he is not a part of this family. We have not always agreed on details. But we agree on the most important things. We believe in family. We believe in business. And like all of you here tonight, we believe in Gotham City. Ladies and gentlemen, the son I never had, Mr. Bruce Wayne. [people gasp softly] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [party horn blows] - [Gordon] I think I see them! - [Barbara] Wh-What? As if it matters! I hardly ever see you anyway! I'm just saying, there's no need to... [Gordon] Hey, Harvey! Shouldn't you be working, Captain? I am. This is the largest police presence this city's ever seen. We got caught with our pants down on Christmas, but Heaven help Holiday if he tries anything here tonight. [earpiece chirps] Always on duty! [sighs] Always. You didn't bring the kids? They're sleeping over at my mother's tonight. We should try and hire you to sit next time, Gilda. I bet you're great with kids. I haven't worked as a sitter in years. [chuckles] It paid her way through law school. I didn't know you're a lawyer. I was. Now I'm not anything. [Joker humming "Auld Lang Syne"] [Joker] Dead pilot? Check! Ground crew? Check! Poison gas? Check! Time to ring in the new year. [engine starting] Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts as I have no idea how to fly this thing! [laughing maniacally] [ship horn blowing] Looks like a real party. So what the hell are we doing here? I don't know. Something tells me this is where I need to be tonight. We... [sighs] Look, we haven't talked, and I think we should. I feel like whatever this is... whatever we've tried to be to one another is... unraveling. And we both know why. We've never spoken of it, but the truth is that you and I are two different people. It was fun to try, but I don't think we're ever gonna be able to put it all together. I guess we're just not cut out for... whatever this is. Was. Don't worry, though. I'll see you on the other side. When did you do it? Do what? You took my watch without me noticing. So when did you do it? I'm curious. Take it from me, Bruce, around here, curiosity can get you killed. [earpiece chirps] Not now. What? Where? I just want to have a normal night. Can we just have a normal night? I don't even know what that is anymore! I am alone here. I told myself it was okay because it would get better, but it hasn't! You don't have to be alone! We've talked about having a baby. I can't! You know that I can't! Maybe not the old-fashioned way, but that doesn't mean that we can't try something... I don't want it! I don't want it because I can't and I can't because I don't want it! Can we please talk about this in private? Jesus, why can't you be more like... More like who? I'm only one man. I can't do this. Not now. Excuse us. Jim, did you know they're having these kinds of problems? Jim? Yeah. I see it now. [people] Huh? [woman] What's going on? Crappy New Year! [laughing maniacally] [exclaims] [people shouting indistinctly] Hey! [growls] [Joker] ♪ Should all offenses be forgot And never brought to trial... ♪ [laughs] Oh, silly me! The safety! Ha!

[both grunting] [Joker chuckles] [laughing] What are you trying to prove with this stunt, Joker? Prove? Stunt? Joker? No, wait, that one's right. [giggles] - Why did you kill Johnny Viti? - What? And Mickey Chen and Milos Grappa? [laughs] You think I'm Holiday? Oh, poppet, I didn't know you cared! [snickering] Of course I'm not Holiday! If I were him, why would I be trying to kill him? Kill him? He's the competition! And, like the corn kernel always says, "I won't be number two." If it's Holiday you want dead, then why gas everyone in Gotham Square? Half the city's down there! Which means Holiday either is or isn't! I have a fifty-fifty chance. And if I fail, well, at least I've killed a lot of innocent people. [laughs maniacally] No, don't kill me! Not before I find out who Holiday is! Why do you care? Oh, you adorable fool. Don't you know by now? I'm just like you! We both love a good puzzle. So... when the clock strikes 12:00, do I get a little kiss? [grunts] [laughs maniacally] Whoop! Taking that as a "no." [groans] There goes my resolution. Ha! Out of the way. Now! Move! Alberto, right? Selina. Can I ask you a question? I'm trying to imagine what it's like to grow up around all this. I wouldn't know. "Mr. Family" had me in boarding schools overseas before I could walk. Which is fine. I would have never fit in here anyway. I'm an Oxford graduate who's learned more about business than my father could ever hope to understand, yet... You don't get a seat at the table. Because I'm "weak." I fell in love. How is that weak? [sighs] She was the wrong woman. Wrong for the family. [sighs] Wrong for him. And, back then, I was so desperate for his approval. What happened to her? Terrible things. I let him... scare her away from me. Which, ironically, only proved that he was right about me in the first place. Weak. An embarrassment. I'm sorry, I don't mean to... [sighs] Why do I feel like I can talk to you? Uh... I, um... I just... Oh! No! No... Oh! No! I'm sorry, I... I can't... We can't... [Batman] Get away from her. Bruce! Wait. Bruce? Wayne? Bruce Wayne is... is the Batman? And Alberto Falcone is Holiday. Surprises all around. Me? You've been fed some bad clues, Bruce. But I still solved the puzzle. The rejected son, born to inherit an empire, but cast aside. You're wrong. You knew you'd never be handed the keys to the kingdom, so you manufactured a crisis that targets the family business. What? With potential successors dropping like flies, Poppa tightened the circle to family only, and for the first time, you were on the inside. I don't want control of the family! I never did! [crowd] Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! - I would happily trade that for a normal life! - Four! Three! - To spend my days as far away from Gotham as possible. - Two! One! Happy New Year! To get married, and have a child with... - [gunshot] - [fireworks bursting] Oh, my God! You couldn't know. You're missing so many pieces. [grunting] [people exclaiming] [woman exclaims] [screams] [indistinct chatter] Come on. Jim, what the hell are we doing? Oh. The divers will be fishing out parts of Alberto Falcone for days. Five-bladed prop on its slowest speed. Hell of a way to go. That isn't how he went. He was shot by Holiday before going overboard. Hang on. Alberto wasn't Holiday? I thought he was. It was Occam's Razor, Jim, the simplest solution. But it was wrong. I went there for Alberto Falcone. I thought I was supposed to stop him, but... I was supposed to save him. He was innocent. And now he's dead. I needed to be better. [Gordon] We all did. All of us. You have to put a protective detail on Carmine Falcone. If he'll even let you. Do you realize we started out trying to take down The Roman, and now we're trying to save him? When did that happen? I have a better question. If Alberto Falcone wasn't Holiday, then who is? And who's next? [priest] Grant that our brother may sleep here in peace until You awaken him to glory, for You are the resurrection and the life. Then he will see You face to face and in Your light will see light and know the splendor of God. Amen. [mourners] Amen. [Falcone] Bruce. A word. Carmine. If there's anything I can do... You know what I want you to do, but time and time again you refuse me. The Wayne Foundation isn't a money laundering outfit for the mob. And it won't be, so long as I'm in control. Of course. Oh, how rude of me. I don't believe you've met my associate. Charmed. - [birds chirping] - [serene music playing] Tell me this never has to end. All things wither, Bruce, but if we're lucky... not for a long time. Aren't you forgetting something? Again? [eerie music playing] I can't resist you. No man can. [Poison Ivy] You've been a good boy. The foundation was such a burden to you, to us... just like the rest of the company. You know what you have to do so we can be together. [wind blowing] [grunts] Mr. Wayne, I think you've over fed your philodendron. [gasps] [grunts] [Bruce] Stop! - [Bruce grunts] - [Cat woman groans] [straining] This isn't you, Bruce. She's controlling you somehow. - Oh, hell. Sorry! - [Bruce groans] [Bruce groaning in pain] [gasps] [groans] [groans weakly] [groans] Oh. [Cat woman grunts] [grunts] How did you know? Well, you haven't exactly been discreet. Appearing with Ivy in public and signing assets over to The Roman. I'll wake the lawyers, sir. Police will be here any minute. Tell them everything you remember and then get to bed. You look awful. I told you I don't want a partner. You sure wanted one these past three months. Three months? It took a while to catch the jolly green Jezebel with her guard down. - [Bruce] And Holiday? - Still at large. Gilda, I'm sorry. We'll make the late movie. I'm looking forward to it. I think I'd like to go home. Why? We can... Yeah. Yeah, okay. [Harvey] Jesus! [camera shutter clicks] [Gordon] Harvey... you were right. Chong's been supplying Holiday with his guns. You should have listened to me, Jim, moved on this guy sooner. We might have learned something. [sighs] The Holiday Killer's covering his tracks. [camera shutter clicking] [Gordon] Mother's Day. This one snuck up on us. Sure did. Where's our friend? [camera shutter clicking] [siren wailing] [thunder rumbling] [neighing] [grunts] [Batman] Who helped you escape? - Give me a name or I'll... - [knife thrusts] [Batman grunts] [grunts] [menacing laughter] [Batman gasping] [gasping] [Scarecrow] It was my mother. That's who helped me. I strangled the old witch years ago, but I think she still watches over handsome little Jonny. [whimpering] Happy Mother's Day. [screaming] Mother. [Scarecrow laughs menacingly] Through here. [man] Sweetheart, I don't know if this is the... Take what you want. Don't hurt us. [Batman groaning] [gun firing] [breathing heavily] [woman] Is he okay? I don't care. Let's go. [gasps] Bruce, what are you doing? [Bruce] Mother? We have to get you home. [thunder rumbling] Bruce! Where... where is she, Alfred? - She? - My... my mother. I was with my mother. [grunts] Up we go. [reporter] Gotham police are searching for two inmates that escaped from Arkham Asylum last night. One of them, Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka the Scarecrow, stole one of Arkham's horses from the grounds. He's considered extremely dangerous. Anyone with knowledge of his whereabouts needs to call the Gotham PD hotline right away. Again, he's considered highly dangerous. Wait. I packed your lunch. Thanks. I gotta go. [door closes] I've come to see my father. It's a tie. [sighs wearily] And, yes, my parole officer knows I'm here. Sofia, my little girl. Heat give you any trouble downstairs? There's more cops here than I ever saw in ten years on the inside. "Holiday detail." For my protection, or so they tell me. - Listen, I'm very busy, so... - That's why I need to talk to you. Poppa, I want to be in the room. Sofia, we have already discussed... I executed the Crane escape like you ordered. And this foolish war with Sal Maroni, I think... Basta! [sighs] Things... are strained. Half our top earners have been taken out by either Holiday or Maroni. We had a chance with Wayne, but now that he's out, we have to restructure. That is exactly why you need me. I do not. Sofia, if I bring you in now, our new earners will think I am lining up a successor. And that will make me look old... and weak. You are neither. Nevertheless. Good. End of discussion. Now go buy something. Big, flashy. A dress, a car. I don't care. Just make sure everybody sees it. Happy Father's Day, Poppa. [Bruce] Awful business at First Gotham. How do you know it was the Scarecrow? Crane recently fled Arkham. Gases all of his victims with a fear-inducing neurotoxin, so... Yeah, you can't really miss him. - Look, So, Mr. Wayne... - It's Bruce. Can I get you anything? Alfred makes a terrific Mai Tai. It's 8:30 in the mor... No... no, thank you. We have some questions about New Year's Eve. The night Alberto Falcone was murdered. Harvey here was updating the files. And it seems that you were the only passenger on that yacht who didn't give us a statement. Afraid I'm not much help. I left the party before all the commotion in a dinghy. You probably noticed it was missing. Of course, I'd have given you a statement anyway, except that it would have been a matter of public record and could place my name next to that of the young lady I went to meet. I don't think her husband likes me very much. That's very convenient. Well, not for her husband. [chuckles] [clears throat] Here's what I'm trying to understand. You recently signed over significant areas of your business - to Carmine Falcone. - That's all been reversed. And I was drugged and manipulated, if that's what you mean. Was your father drugged and manipulated when he went into business with The Roman? You know everything that monster is today was born of the legitimacy handed him by the name Wayne... Harvey. [Bruce] It's all right. Yes, my father built hospitals with Falcone... but the only influence he was under was an overwhelming desire to save innocent lives. And how many other innocent lives did he end up trading for it? Two... that I know of. - [door opens] - [Vincent] Please help my son. I have nowhere else to go. - This way! Over here. - [Alfred] Onto the desk. [sighs] Looks like four... No, five bullet wounds to the chest. You shouldn't have come here. Your son needs to be in a hospital. Where Luigi Maroni could find him and finish the job? No, Dr. Wayne, please. Carmine is my only son. [sighs] I'll do what I can. - Alfred, get my bag. - [Alfred] Right away, sir. He's stable, but I don't want to move him yet. Grazie. I can never repay you. He isn't out of the woods. Come on, we have to let him rest. You shouldn't be here. It's okay. Do you know who my father is? The Roman? [coughs] Smart kid. So you know who I'm going to be? The Roman. Very smart. You remind me of my boy. Your pop saved my life. I guess that makes us family. It fell out of your pocket. My insurance policy. There's a lot of bad people out there. Criminals. And everybody knows criminals are superstitious. Sometimes all it takes to get out of a bad situation is a good flip of the coin. It didn't work for you tonight? [chuckles] Yeah. Still, two heads are better than one. No? Keep it, kid. All we get is all we take. I was eight when Dr. Thomas Wayne pulled Luigi Maroni's bullets out of Falcone's chest. My father was dead by a mobster's hand within a year. Any connection between my family and The Roman died then, too. Thank you for stopping by. If there's nothing else... [Alfred] Gentlemen, these are the names and addresses for those who can account for Master Wayne's whereabouts on the night in question. A lot of names on here. Must have been quite a night. Yes, well, a man was murdered. Let us hope your respective offices can deliver for him the justice still denied Thomas and Martha Wayne. What happened to them was a tragedy. And all the more reason why your boss should stay away from men like Falcone. Will there ever be a time when the sins of fathers don't fall to their sons for redemption? Good day. [door closes] They're going to be watching my every move today to confirm that I'm not the killer. Then you'll be staying in? No, just pay off some more alibis. I have to go to work. Sit tight. If he knew about us, it would kill him. I'll be right here, love. [Maroni] Your favorite cannolis. Cannoli. Cannolo for one, cannoli for a box. Your Italian is sterco. I know, Poppa. I'm sorry. Yeah. You bring cannoli on Father's Day, I forgive. Sit. So... This war with Falcone. It's killing us, Pop. Carmine thinks we've got something to do with this... this Holiday jerk. Sciocchezze. Carmine's paranoia is not to do with Holiday but with the new DA. Unless these two are one and the same. Dent's a crusader but I can't see him getting his hands dirty. More likely the Bat. You want advice? Win or lose, the only thing that ends war is peace. Make peace with Carmine? [groans] Poppa... I don't know. - I don't... - [arrow swishes] [groans] Poppa! Poppa! [screaming] [panting] [breathing heavily] Sal! I heard a gunshot. Are you okay? What happened? [sobbing] Strange place to do business. Guessing it's the last spot the pigs leave you alone these days. [Maroni] Working late? How the hell did you get through security? You were with him, right? I needed to put an end to the stupid war with the Falcones. My father's last words to me were that I should make peace with my enemy. At first I thought he meant Carmine, but Luigi Maroni would have never wanted that. There's only one other thing he could have meant, so... I'm here to make peace with the law. Cut a deal. You want Falcone and I got plenty on him. Enough to put him away for good. In exchange for... Dropping all outstanding warrants against me and my men. [scoffs] You want Falcone? That's the deal. Take it or leave it. Tell you what. Heads, I'll take it. I expected a low turnout after the New Year's fiasco. - But this is really pathetic. - Fine by me. The more people stay home, the easier my job gets. Speaking of jobs getting easier, is it true you got Maroni? It's not a done deal. My office is working out the details now. But if ol' Sal tells a judge what he's told me... Let's just say today's a good day for The Roman to celebrate what's left of his freedom. Speak of the devil. I'm surprised to find you outdoors on a holiday. - Dent. - Falcone. Actually, I was speaking to your wife... Mrs. Dent. Don't touch her. I never took you for a patriot, Carmine. Oh, I wouldn't miss fireworks like this for all the world. Good evening, Mrs. Dent, Captain. [Gordon] Evening. I tell you, Harv, if I could, I'd have every cop in the city here tonight. [indistinct radio chatter] [woman sniveling] [Scarecrow] See you on the other side. [laughs] [Scarecrow grunts] [Scarecrow grunts] [grunts] - [metallic clang] - [Batman grunts] [in British accent] Utter inanity proved his insanity while he rattled a couple of bones. [boy grunting] I've been thinking about it and maybe you're right. Uh, about what? Having kids. Stay down. Get to Gordon. I'll be back. Harvey, no. Harvey! [grunts] [Cat woman straining] [both grunt] Get out of here. Not till I know why this scumbag is trying to kill me. If I was trying to kill you, you'd would be dead already. - Then what are you... - [both grunting] [yells] [grunts] That's enough. [Cat woman panting] Someone's trying to provoke you, Dent. Into doing what? Good question... [groans] [groans weakly] [grunts] [both grunting] [panting] [exhales] [growling voice] Get up. [Mad Hatter] The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand. They wept like anything to see such quantities of sand. "If seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year, "do you suppose," the walrus said, "that they could get it clear?" Huh... I doubt it. There... that's the drop. As for the Bat, delivering him wasn't part of the deal. [inhales] So we can do whatever we want with him. [laughs] What fun. Twinkle, twinkle little bat... how I wonder what you're... [grunts] Your business with The Roman ends tonight. [groans] No. [shrieks, coughs] - [Mad Hatter laughing] - [screams] Poor little thing. Such a tiny little thing. [continues laughing] [groaning] [Harvey] No. - [footsteps approaching] - [indistinct radio chatter] - [man] Down here. - [woman] What do you got? [growling voice] Run! Motive means opportunity. Dent. All right, let me be clear, this freak is done terrorizing my family. Done! You expect us to believe that a respected public servant... - I don't know why you watch that garbage. - Is it true? You believe this BS? Is that why you want a divorce? I never said that. I have been talking about therapy. Maybe divorce isn't so bad, now that you can't go back to him... [growling voice] Ungrateful bitch. I'm... I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. I'm going to be late for court. You left the basement door open again. I haven't been in the basement today. [door clicks open and closes] [indistinct chatter] Mr. Dent? Mr. Dent, are you ready to proceed? [clears throat] Uh, yes. Yes, Your Honor. Thank you. [growling voice] Murderer. What? I asked if you're ready, Mr. Dent. Yes, of course. [clears throat] Mr. Maroni, you have confessed to 19 counts... [growling voice] Confess. What the hell is he... He's here, Captain. The roof. Mr. District Attorney, we are all waiting. Uh, yes, yes. Sorry, Your Honor. [Gordon] Rooftop really necessary? I thought you'd want privacy. Harvey's starting to lose it down there. I think all this Holiday speculation in the press is finally getting to... Privacy? Why? Where'd you find them? You're not going to like it. Uh, yeah. I hit Frankie Gazzo and his brother Lenny. Tossed their bodies in the Gotham River. Lots of wise guys you're looking for are in there. Maybe that's why I got an ulcer. You know, from drinking the water? [laughter] And didn't you commit these murders and felonies under direct orders from Carmine "The Roman" Falcone? Felonies? Nah, guy's a saint. [indistinct murmuring] [raucous laughter] - [growling voice] Now. - Now. [Maroni] You okay, Dent? What is it, heartburn? Happy to share. Now, Mr. Maroni, may I remind you that your immunity is contingent upon your truthful testimony during these proceedings. And I told you the truth. Falcone is clean as a whistle. [growling voice laughs] Sal, what are you doing? What I'm told. Okay. - Um, Your Honor, in light of the witness's... - [growling voice] Double cross! ...change of heart, I need to request a continuance. Continuance? Uh. what is that? Like, uh, a holiday? - What? - [growling voice] Holiday. You know, like Father's Day. Luigi Maroni sends his regards. [growling voice] Go. [grunts and screams] [people gasping] [Maroni laughs] Bailiff, detain the witness! You're dead, Holiday! You hear me, Dent? That stuff will eat through concrete! [people screaming] - [Batman] Harvey! - [Gordon] My God. Call an ambulance! [Harvey panting] [imperceptible] [growling voice] Idiots. They think it's you. [Harvey straining] Who are you? [growling voice] You know who I am. No, I... [growling voice] You sound tired. Why not let me take the wheel? I don't know what's happening. [growling voice] I'm sorry no one told you, Harv. Told me what? You're dead. [phone ringing] I have to take this. Yeah. [grumbles] Now? No, it's the perfect time. The doctor says he'll be fine in a few days. Don't worry. Oh, my God, he's gone. Secure the exits. He couldn't have gotten far. Let's go! - [growling voice] Well, where is... - [phone ringing] Let me guess. You're not coming after all. [Falcone] Afraid not. Yeah. You're not really one to get your hands dirty. [Falcone] You know nothing about me. I know you're a liar, a thief, a murderer. [Falcone] A father. - A coward. - [Falcone] Goodbye, Dent. Fine. He wants to talk to you. [thug grunts] [both gasping] - [straining] - [bones crack] Come on, come on. Really? [sighs] - [music playing] - [indistinct chatter] It's not personal. It's business. [laughs] [singing "Happy Birthday" in Italian] [all singing along] [crowd cheering] - [in English] Happy birthday, Poppa! All right, here we go. [guests cheering] What a wonderful night. Thank you. This year has been a trying one. And while we have yet to fully dismantle the vicious machine the law has set against us, you might say we put a dent in it. [laughter] To Sofia Falcone, for brokering the peace with Maroni. Mille grazie. [guests clapping] And my beautiful sister, Carla. Where is she? Carla? [indistinct murmurs] Probably more TV interviews. [guests laugh] Now, now. Those interviews helped. I think she's got a future. [guests laughing] [elevator bell dings] [guests screaming] - [gasps] - Sorry to startle you. Shouldn't you be looking for Harvey? I'm narrowing down his location by interviewing known associates. Known associ... Oh... Well, you're wasting your time. The man's a mystery. Or so it would seem. Did you notice any recent changes in his behavior? Mood swings? Is that so strange when you deal with people like Falcone every day? Harvey never mentioned he went to Oxford. Is it important? Maybe. This doesn't feel like just a job for you. It's personal. Why? He's my friend, and he needs help. [rats squealing] [growls] Dinner time already? Solomon Grundy Born on a Monday. Christened on a Tuesday, married on a Wednesday, Ill on Thursday, worse on Friday. - Died on Saturday. - [chomping noises] Buried on Sunday. That was the end. [Grundy gulps] Born on a Monday. Reborn, resurrected. On a Monday. Is that what happened to you? Did you die and come back? Can a man live two lives? Born on a Monday. Born on a Monday. [Calendar Man] Thirty days hath September. But today's the one that troubles you the most. [Batman] Where is he? It's been months. I've missed you. The DA who was attacked and maimed before vanishing from the hospital. Hm, he does that. Later that night, Carla Viti, who'd publicly accused Dent of being Holiday, was killed on her way to her brother's birthday party. I know. Wasn't that terrible? I think she was right. Of course you do. It seems everyone who comes after Dent winds up dead. We need to find Harvey before he kills again. What do you know? Gordon and his men have been here day after day asking the same thing. I'll tell you what I told the captain. Let me walk out of here and I'll stop the killing. We're done. It's Labor Day. And, if the pattern holds, I believe you have something Holiday wants. [sirens wailing] [Gordon] Head North on At well. - Sir, the penitentiary is South... - I know where it is. This is the longest goddamn prisoner transfer I've ever seen. [scoffs] Guess you guys just can't get enough of me. [officer gasps] [growls] Dent! You're alive? He's no longer running this operation. - [gun cocking] - All right... that's enough. Relax, Jim, I'm not here to kill Maroni. I'm here to thank him for giving me a new... outlook. Oh, my God. Harvey... I have to tell you, Jimbo, your gun has come in handy. I know it was meant for Harvey, but possession is nine-tenths. If you're not Harvey, then, who are you? Holiday? We found the guns in your basement. You found the guns in my basement? Of course. We know everything. We just wanna take you to get help. I think Thomas Wayne was onto something. You can't beat 'em, Jimbo, not your way. Join 'em first. Then beat 'em on their own terms. Heads, you die. [Grundy groaning, coughing] [man in black outfit] It is up to you, Harvey. You and I know that both sides of that coin are heads. How the hell could you... Oh, nice outfit, Bats. I suppose this little trap was your idea. Drop the gun, now! [cocks gun] [gunshot] No! [grunts] [Grundy coughing] - Come on, Grundy, move your ass. [sighs] I think we're back to square one. Ah, you're up early. Hm? Oh, no, I just got in. Of course. Then I suppose it's off to bed with you. - Is there something I can help... - How did it happen, Alfred? Were they forced into business with the Falcones? Or were they so set on building a legacy that they'd work with the devil himself? Your parents believed that there are two ways to look at everything... and everyone. Only two? They were young. Two exceptionally good people living in an exceptionally bad place, trying to make it better. But Falcone? Didn't they know that by legitimizing him, they were helping to make a monster? They made difficult choices and more than a few mistakes. But they were willing to pay for them. I've always told myself that I'm doing what I do to honor them. What does it mean if deep down, I'm really doing it to redeem them? I think it means your parents would be proud... of their real legacy. [Gilda] This is absurd. Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am, but it's Halloween. - Mr. Dent is still at large. - And Captain Gordon ordered us to be here. So, you're stuck with us. You've blocked in my car. We're more than happy to drive you anywhere you need to go. Though you'll be making our jobs a lot easier if you remain indoors. There's no way to know where or when your husband will show up. My husband is dead. I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's not true. Yes, it is. [wind blowing] [guard] Wake up, Julian. You know what today is. [inhales and exhales deeply] It's All Hallows' Eve... the 31st day of the tenth month, and the 305th of this miserable leap year. And... [sighs] Taco Tuesday. Muy bueno. - [distant thumping] - What the hell? Trick or treat. [Batman] Attacking us like that out in the open... It didn't fit the profile. So it was a hired gun. We see Dent and Holiday in the same place at the same time, and, just like that, the DA has got himself an alibi. Did Harvey study at Oxford? Like Falcone's boy? I see where you're going but don't let Harvey hear you say it. He's a Gotham U man. A dyed-in-the-wool nighthawk. Don't get hung up on it. Not every lead checks out. And we already have what we need to make our case. It's hard to believe the man who stood on this roof and made that promise, that bond with each of us, would cross the line. Can you honestly say that man and the one we met in the alley were the same? There are deep scars there... and I'm not talking about his face. If you think we're wrong, find the evidence. But, for now, the best way to save lives, including Harvey's, is to bring him in. [wind whooshes softly] Do you know what my people call this past year? The Long Halloween. My nephew, my son, my sister, half my men... Why? Why would Dent kill your son? I wish I had the chance to be a better father to my boy. We will never see each other again. For that, I am so... so sorry. There is a rule among my kind. We leave the wives out of it, but Dent does not play by our rules. And when that happens, people die. Whose wives? I guess justice really is blind. [gun cocking] [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] [grunts in pain] Poppa. Everything is fine, Sofia. I just stumbled. That wasn't necessary. Maybe not. Are you going to tell me why you're so obsessed with them? I never thanked you for finding me and getting me home that night. You thought I was your mother. Scarecrow's fear toxin. Where you found me is where I lost her. I don't even know my mother's name. But I think there's someone who can tell me. [Batman] Your father. Are you sure? When the time comes, I'm not sure I'll have it in me to ask. [chuckles] Is there even such a thing as a normal family in this city? Maybe not... for people like us. [distant explosion] What the hell is that? [police officer] Oh, shit! [police dispatcher] All units, 10-33 at the corner of 6th and Mason. - All available units respond. - [sirens blaring] No, Captain said we don't leave for anything, not tonight. [people coughing] [horse neighing] [people screaming] [humming "Pop goes the Weasel" menacingly] ♪ Pop goes the weasel ♪ [sirens wailing] Keep coming, boys. Everyone's invited to this party. Not everyone. [fire alarm ringing] Head. I meant heads! Sofia, please. It was nothing. Stop treating me like an old man. You're not old. [sighs] Maybe I am... too old for this business, at least. Have you... heard from your mother? She loves you. Just not this place. [Falcone] This place is me. I know you think that and maybe at one time it was. But things have changed, so much... so fast. Haven't I changed with them? Yes, you have. But when you were coming up when Mama was here, you wouldn't have thought to hire freaks like Poison Ivy and Scarecrow. These... people, they're not stable, Poppa. Times change. [man on intercom] Boss! Something's wrong downstairs. The cops took off and we can't get any of our guys on the comm. Maron... [man on radio screams in agony] [static] [eerie music playing] [growls] [men screaming on intercom] Sofia, no! Come on, you mother... [Falcone] Sofia! [screams] [laughing menacingly] What is this? Judgment day. [distant sirens] [officer] We lost them in the sewers. You're right. This was meant to distract us. Yeah, but distract us from what? [Two-Face] I really owe it all to you, Carmine. You've taught me that all men are guilty... and innocent. Which makes justice nothing more than the flip of a coin. The outcome unpredictable. That is, of course... unless the system is corrupted, rigged in a man's favor. Legit businessman/philanthropist by day. Criminal racketeer, murderer by night. You've rigged every game you've ever played in your business and your family. It's really the most minor of adjustments, a small change of outlook that decides if you live... or not. Just pull the fucking trigger. You haven't listened. If you had, you'd understand that for the first time, Carmine, it really isn't up to me. Good luck. [all coughing] [Two-Face] No! [Penguin laughing menacingly] [yelling] [gas hisses] [Penguin laughing] En garde, you sanctimonious shit... Ow! [Joker laughing menacingly] Nancy, hold all my calls. I have to terminate someone. [Batman] Harvey, don't! [grunts] - [birds chirping] - [serene music playing] Alone at last. Now let's get you out of all this. Stay back. [groans weakly] [Batman] Harvey. You don't have to do this. Harvey, Harvey, Harvey. Can't you see I'm a new man, Bats? I'm finally awake. And, unlike Harvey Dent, I'm not beholden to petty motives like revenge, or, worse, career advancement. A weight has been lifted. I don't have to decide who's innocent and who's guilty anymore. All I have to do is... execute. - Guilty. - No! - No! - [gunshots] [grunting] [Falcone groaning] Poppa. Sofia, no! [gun clicks] Two bullets only. Sorry, gorgeous. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - [gun clicking] [sobbing] [gun clicking] [gasps] Sofia. [straining] I can't... I can't hold on. [loud crash] [faint clock ticking] [gasps] [sighs] [grunts] [groaning weakly] Louisa? Louisa. Selina. [sputters] - Selina? - Let me help you. No. No. All we get is all we take. Do you still believe? Yes... I do. Good. [exhales] [floodlight powering down] Harvey? [Batman] Not anymore. [Harvey] It had to be done. You will never convince me of that. [Harvey] There won't be any judges to be bribed. No witnesses to disappear. The Roman is dead and Two-Face killed him. The Long Halloween... is over. We'll get you help. You're the ones who're gonna need help from now on. Harvey... Two-Face... whatever. You betrayed everything you believe in. Not everything. Arrest me, Jimbo. I'm responsible. Not just for Falcone, but all the Holiday killings. I have to face judgment. [handcuffs clicks] The cost. The promise we made right here, one year ago to take down The Roman. In the end... was it worth it? He's asking if the good guys won. Yes, the good guys won. But we won't know for a very long time if it was worth it. Gilda. [fire crackling] It had to be done. You know that. The same way you knew Harvey never went to Oxford. That was me. Well, me and... Alberto Falcone. If you could see how in love we were then. I was pregnant. He didn't hesitate. We were married that same day. He was heir to The Roman empire. And his father could never welcome into the family a child conceived out of wedlock. I tried to fight. But what chance did I have opposite the godfather of Gotham? Against my will, our marriage was annulled and our child ripped from my womb. What they did to me... the way it was done... left me broken. You wanted revenge. I wanted justice. I came to Gotham and married the man I thought had the best chance of delivering it. Oh... Harvey and I were so much alike, only what was inside him hadn't yet been ripped out. That was... useful. And... even fun for a time. But then he became so busy wrestling his own demon, I was left to take down mine all by myself. One holiday, one twisted family snapshot at a time. I have no regrets about what I did to The Roman, or his son, or anyone else in that godforsaken family. But Harvey, in the end, I loved him. But not all of him. So... are you going to take me away or just... stand there in judgment? I need to know that Holiday is done. Not done... finished. I wonder... how long did he know about me? Is that how you figured it out? Did Harvey tip you off? He didn't give you up. Not knowingly. But after Maroni was killed, the way he protected Holiday, he must have known then. He was my friend. He believed in me. I should have saved him. What will you do now? Tell Gordon? [Bruce] Alfred. Really? I know it's late, sir, but you never know. It doesn't matter how late it is. We don't get trick-or-treaters. Not all Gotham families share your obstinate hope. It's going to take a lot more good people trying to make things better before we see real change. [doorbell rings] If you say so, sir. You're cute when you're wrong. [child] Trick or treat. [doorbell rings] [door opens] It's for you, sir.
