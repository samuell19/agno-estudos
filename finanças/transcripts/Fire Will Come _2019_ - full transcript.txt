Amador Coro. Look, what do you think? Is he the pyromaniac? Yes, that's him. He's the one who set the whole mountain on fire. He almost burnt Lugo down. Let me see? They're going to let him go? He has served two years, he's been granted parole. Poor bastard. FIRE WILL COME - How are you Inazio? - I'm OK. Thanks. - OK, bye. - See you. Hey, Amador. - Need a lift? - No, thanks. Are you sure? It's raining... I'd rather walk. OK. Hello mother. I'm gonna stay for a while. Are you hungry? I'm taking the cows to the Granda da Osa. They've grazed almost everything. Take it out a little. It would be better to bring them to Veiguiliña. They love going there. Look at Parda, she recognizes you! Come on, let's go. Easy, Parda. Come on, Careta. Come on, Cachorra. Bloody hell! Damn it! So many brambles! Jesus. Is Inazio around? Inazio! We're going to finish this one, then we'll fix the others. And then we'll live off the rents. Very good. Do you think that many tourists will come here? Of course! Galicia is top notch, Benedicta! It will be crowded! Your folks would be so happy... What about Amador, couldn't he work with you? But does he want to? Luna, come. Amador... You won't have to go back there, right? Yes, there are checkups from time to time. Well I'm really happy that you're home... Bit more... OK. May Jesus Christ Who was crucified for your sake free you from excruciating pain. May Jesus Christ free you from the death that never ends, and recognize you as one of His own. Lord, we pray for Your servant Jose, and commend him to Your mercy. For his sake, You came down from heaven. Receive him now into the joy of Your kingdom. For he has believed in God. May he rest in peace. May his soul and those of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. My condolences. Thank you. I'm so sorry. My condolences. Thank you Benedicta. I heard that your son is back. Yes. - Are you happy? - I am. How is he? Good. My condolences, Lidia. I'm happy for you, you suffered a lot. Aren't you going to confession? Amador, have you got a light? Don't listen to them, they're joking. Leave him alone! Hi, neighbors. Hello Inazio. Are you coming from Jose's funeral? Yes. Poor Lidia, it's so sad... He went for a 2-day hospital stay... and stayed there. How are you, Amador? Good. When are you coming over? We'll be working on the house all summer. All right. Well... I have to go. OK, see you soon. See you soon Inazio. What did Inazio do to you? Are you mad at him because he didn't come to visit you? Why would he have had to visit? Well... Amador. What happened? Calm down. Stop, girl. Come on, stop. Calm down. What happened? Come on, girl. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, help me! Fuck it. - Keep pulling! - This way? Yes, easy. - Pull! - Like this? - Yes, pull! - OK. Is she coming? Go! - Is she out? - Yes, it's OK! - Is she standing? - It's OK. Come see her. -It looks swollen, doesn't it? -Rather. OK, we've got to treat her, she needs to stay at home... for one or two weeks. We will see. Is she pregnant? No she's not. That's better, in a way: we can give her a stronger treatment. I'm here since a while now, but I'd never seen you before. I was away. Abroad? Yes. My family emigrated too. But I wanted to live in the countryside, so I studied in vet school. No need to study to live in the countryside. You're right. Do you like it? I like how it sounds but I don't get what it says. No need to understand the lyrics to get the music. All this work for nothing. You don't agree? Why are you saying this? Filling this up with tourists? What good can it bring? Some trees are dry. It must be cancer. The foliage has dried out. If you touch them, you'd think they had burnt. They say that it was the trucks coming from abroad, that they were infected. And where did these trucks come from? Not from other planets, right? From Australia... or from a lab. Look how they stick out above the others. Eucalyptus are fast growers, always looking for the sky. Their roots can be kilometers long. If you scratch the earth around, you'll find roots wooven together like an old bag of potatoes. They strangle any tree or plant trying to grow. They're a plague. Worse than the devil. If they hurt others, it's because they hurt, too. Did you rest last night? Yes, I did. I had strange dreams. I don't know where they came from... Don't worry about it, relax today. We need to keep treating her, and we'll see the result. We should keep insisting. - Sure... - Hi. -Hi, Amador, how are you? -Good, good. What do you think? She looks better to me, but we should keep going for a couple more days. So... We'll see how she reacts to the treatment... then she should be all right. OK. Do you sometimes come to Navia? Sometimes, yes. So you can pick up the treatment... Keep giving her shots for three or four days, and we'll see, OK? -OK. -I have to go... See you soon. Come have coffee with us, come! Thanks Benedicta but I can't stay... I still got a lot of consultations... For a second! - Thank you. Today I can't... - It won't be a minute! - No? - Another day. OK... I really hope that you will come back. - Thank you. - My pleasure, bye. Here, drink. Did you put honey? Yes, two spoons. It's very bitter. - It tastes awful. - Lick the spoon! No. It's really bitter, you may have mixed up the glasses. Don't be a pain. This is just a whim. You're right, it's a whim, I make a fuss over nothing. If you keep on... taking care of this old lady... you'll end up sick. Shut up and drink. Hello. Hello Amador. I went up to unblock the spring. The water should get here soon. Great, thank you. Was it very clogged? There was mud... and little stones, I don't know how they get in there. OK, well thanks, Amador. It should be cleaned once in a while. Otherwise it'll get clogged again. - OK... - Thanks Amador. Want to have a drink with us? Not today, I got work to do. Thank you, another time. - OK, bye. - OK, Amador, bye. What's wrong with him? He's a good guy, it just hasn't been easy for him. It's been 30 years that the old Berenguela rang for the last time. The bell that rang over Compostela's sky during more than 250 years, has been replaced by an identical replica, cast in Holland. Under Compostellans' curious gazes, the seven tons of bronze were winched to the top of the Fachada de Platerias. On this day of 1989, what was mostly heard, was that this new Berenguela sounded different. They said it was less deep, and had less soul. It sounds the same to me... Easy. Let's see if you've got something here... Luna, go home. Go! Hi, Amador. Hi, Elena. How are you? Good, I'm all right. -You? -Good, thank you. They told you about me, haven't they? Yes, but... Well... You know how people are... Anyway... What I wanted to ask you is how your cow is doing. Good, she's good. Luna! Where are you? Come, Luna! Ancares 4, head of operations speaking, over. Ancares 4, I'm listening. Can you see the fire from your current location? Negative. We are driving towards Robledo de Son. We have a problem with a hamlet in danger. The fire may reach it. Isn't there any Guardia Civil patrol? Negative. They can't reach it by car, you have to go there. Copy. I'll send two men. Out. You shouldn't split the brigade up. They have enough time. It's not dangerous there. Álvaro! David will go with you! OK. Are you scared or what? No... Take this path to the village of la Veiga and when you're done, go right back to the brigade. OK, got it. Let's go. Where will the fire come from? What do I know? If we knew it, we wouldn't have a job. Come on, move it. Are we going to spend the night here? We'll see! Are you already tired? - We have to go! - I won't go. - The fire is coming! We have to go! - No! It's very dangerous to stay here. - We have to go. - I won't leave. Where do you want to take me? What would you do if you were me? Listen, there's a squad up there. We're useless here, we have to get down. - Let's go! - No! Stop, Álvaro, don't be harsh. He won't let go off the hose. - We've got to go. - Never! Go cut the water off. OK David, but hurry, please. Everyone is safe, you're the only one missing. No! - You have got to come with us. - I won't! Come on, trust me! What will you do with me? Everything will be fine. - Take the hose from him! - Let it go, come. I'll go check the other houses. You will see, everything will be OK. My God! Is there anybody here? Hey! Anybody here? I know you need water, but there isn't any. There's no truck. Come on, more hose! Careful with the embers, don't burn the hose! Come on, hurry! Where are the hoses? They're coming, here! Come on, quick! Another hose to the front. - Two, two! - Here they are! Tie the hose at the back, hurry! Ask for water! More hose! Quick, we're losing it! Ask how much there is left. Navia water tender, how much water have you got left? David, Álvaro, hurry up! There's very little water left. Those at the back, spray, don't let the fire get past us. Come on, it's really strong. What's up with this hose, there's no water! Tell them to increase the pressure! Check the hose! It's punctured. It will be tough to stop it! Hurry up, damn it! Change this hose, now! David! Aren't there any left? No! Let's try this way! Seal it! Is it working, David? Come help me. Quick, the fire is getting out of hand. Take the hose off the embers. Tell the head of operations to bring new hoses! It won't last! Head of operations, Ancares 4 speaking, over. I'm listening, Ancares 4. Turn the water off, there's a leak. Copy. Are there more hoses up there? There aren't any left. What do you mean? We can't stop it without hoses! No way to make a backfire? There's a path down here, we could make a backfire there, if we burn everything here, we might stop it. Move back some more, with the hose. - Let's move back! - The machine's coming. Burn this area carefully. It's getting stronger, it's getting really evil. Come help me here. Inazio, come here! Careful here Inazio. From here it'll get to the houses! I don't want any civilians here! Go, you'll get trapped! Leave us alone! Let us do our job! It's getting very strong. Move back! You've got to go! - We can still stop it! - Everyone move back! Go, the firefighters will take care of the houses. Leave-me, goddamnit! Burn everything up, it might stop it. Careful, the wind is turning... The wind is turning! It's picking up! Get out of here. - Quick! - Let's go! Go! Get out where it's burnt. Go! Now! Come. There... This way. Easy... Come. Poor animal. His eyes must've been burnt. - Calm down Inazio. - You calm down. Where are you going? Come on, calm down! He doesn't care! Let me go! Stop! Fucking hell! What did we do to you? Let him go! Stop it! Bastard! - What did we do to you? - You'll kill him! It might not have been him. You don't care about anything! Come on, stop it. Are you OK? Did they hurt you? FIRE WILL COME
