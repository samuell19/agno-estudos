Andy Jovanovic! Good luck. Boxing. Dad? Dad, someone's shouting from outside. "I'm here, Ronnie." Dad is here. My jacket is gone. "Look for him." I'm hungry. - You will eat at school. Can not be. Go. I'll lock you up. Nikki, I really will. Hurry up. The fastest man in the world. "Hurry up." He runs down the stairs. Jovanovic, pay your rent already, I'd hate to throw you out. Okay, I'll pay you. You know? I've been vouching for you for four months. How long do you think they'll put up with it? They'll throw you out of here before you count to three. I will change the locks next week. I'm sick of you. Drummer! Are you crazy? Go. More alive! Not so fast. Next time, be even later. Would be great. I failed earlier. I have to go. Yes, hurry to escape. Great. Where are things, Andy? - Which things? Pacifier, bottle. "I forgot them." You don't care about anything. Come and get them tonight. Why should I take them? - Are you serious? Why should I take them tonight? Come on. Ronnie! Fast. Come on! Today is Sonya's birthday. Cream! Do we have to drive you? Shut up. Karovski. I need more money. It's time to pay me a little more. You can leave. Go away. I don't need you here. I thought I could talk to you. "Shut your mouth." What? "We can't go in." What? "We can't go to Mom's." I can not do anything. "We can't go in." I can not come. Open the door when someone rings. We do not have such an arrangement. "Don't shout like that." I can't take the children today. What are you doing here? Hello dear. "I remind you that you have children." At first I didn't hear the bell. Hello dear. But they can't stay here tonight. I have a surprise for you. - Really? What is it? - I will not tell you. But you can look back. How cute. Do you have a fiftieth? No. I don't have one. Andy, I really don't. Children need shoes. Look, Dad. You have to feed him when you come here. Pour me sausages. - Here. I want some more. - Really? Enough. Eat them. What's wrong? Яж. It's disgusting. - Eat it. Dad! - Eat. He wanted a lot. I want the kitten. "I'll take it out." Unwillingly, I caught the dog. Whatever. It will be for me. That's nice, Dad. Dad, that's nice. No, give it back. - I want it. Chips are for me too. I will touch you. What do you want? Sonya, he came. Don't see him here again. Clear? Will you bring it? "Take her." Spend it in the fresh air. Will you blow it up? Okay, I'll walk her in the air. You're annoying me. This time you remembered. I owe some money to some people. No, Andy. They will throw us out of the apartment. I need 4-5 thousand. How do you imagine it? - How can I imagine it? And I have nothing. - But this one has. It won't hurt you. "Isn't it?" Fuck you, Andy. - You too. Andy. Come on, baby. Because I'm evil. That's why I'm wearing the red sword. He releases lava and in a little while you will fall. There is water next to me. Dad, what are you doing? I need to go out. Will Sonia come today? Fio will sleep here today. Put her to bed. Shut up, both of you. Otherwise, the police will take you and lock you up in a home. They can't take us. The police can, Ronnie. Now enter. What do you want, Andy? You know. Who knows? - I have three children. One is yours. I need the money. Give them back to me. - Soon. If I have his money, will you come back? Of course, but you will not succeed. In a few months I will give you back twice as much. But then you will return home to me. Go away! Ronnie, turn down the radio! Turn it down! What is going on here? Shut up. Are you stupid? Shut up. Quiet! - Let me go! They will call the police. Stop screaming. This is not true. I can not stop. "Stop screaming." Dad, that's enough. You scare us. Fio was crying loudly and Ronnie turned up the radio so the neighbors wouldn't hear her. Right? What do you have to do? What do you have to do? To take her in your arms. For the last and the next four months. Next time you will take off. You did not register the children here. The mold on the ceiling slammed again. Call on TV. Someone can renovate the apartment. Only when they see you will they agree. Don't you understand from a joke? Do you know how much they pay me to follow you all day? Nicky, hurry up. Get up. Come on, Ronnie. Hurry up. For the last time. - No. It doesn't work. Please. "I'm going to get in trouble." I'll take her to lunch. "I said it wouldn't happen." Andy. I told you I would take everything. Andy! - Get out and take your child. Give me my money back. Give them to me, and we will forget everything. They are not with me. Don `t irritate me. - Are you crazy? I need. Are you stupid? They are not with me. Take your child and take care of him. I'll pay you back, but not now. Yes, but Mike ... Knock this idiot and you will shut his mouth. Slut. What I told you? Where is? - He's gone. Where is the money? "Don't touch me!" I'll fuck you, you bastard. Stop the bus. Stop it! Stop the damn bus! What are you doing? Come on. - Do not touch me! Get out of here! I don't need you today. I took another in your place. If he's good, you don't have to go back. It can't be that way. "Maybe, as you can see." I can't stand delays. - Karovski, I need the job. I can not help you. Go away. Disappear. Karovski! How are you? Are you okay with your head? His car is not here. Why did I believe you at all? I will collect them. I'll give them back, but to you, not this asshole. He's not an asshole. "Sonia, he beat up a woman." He didn't beat me. "Sure." Open your eyes. Enough! He beat a woman. Take the little one and come to me. By the end of the month, get your money back, Andy. How to do it? I have nothing. All right. Give me my money back, or you won't see Fio again. Are you crazy? I just want a good life for the baby and for myself. I don't need you for that. We don't need you, Andy. Watch your mouth. "Try to get your money back." Sonya. You can't do that. You will not do it. Flappy, come on. This one was nasty. Hello feathers. What will you do now? I will interrupt the work of the site. How will you feed all the throats? The children are dressed too lightly. It is cold outside. I'll think of something. I will box again. Do you know why Mohammed Ali was a strong boxer? Because he had something in his head. He was smarter than the others. If I don't return her money, she will take my child. You always just wanted to smear everyone. Then they smeared you. "I was stupid and young." I didn't think about winning, but about not becoming more. And now? I will win. Take better care of them. I will leave them here today. - Today? No. Should we take this garbage or throw it away? Dad, your heart is beating very fast. Take your things. Ask at Cassiopeia. At least they won't smudge your face. He's right. You are no longer good. Cassiopeia is always looking for people. For what? "I don't know about everything." The preliminary round is in 12 days, and the final - a day later. Each of you who qualifies today can participate. 75 kg. The next one. Line up in the queue. People, line up. We're leaving. "Did you sign up?" I will not build. "What's so bad?" 80 kg. The next one. Name? - Jovanovic. 89 kg. The next one. Where are the others from? Russians, Poles, Czechs ... They do everything. Do you have old injuries? - Not at the moment. What is this? Nothing. "Something from before?" Broken wrist, fingers and that. Anything else? Sit down. Sit down. "What?" Today you will sleep with your mother. Enough! I don't know, but he says not to do it. I don't care. They give 5,000 euros. - Really? Then I will come. You will defeat everyone. Before, your father was the strongest. He kept bragging that you could protect me. I trusted you blindly. Dad, have you been to anyone before? Of course. Everyone in the neighborhood fell for your mother. Dad, did you have to fight like a ninja? I don't remember anymore. "Of course, like a super ninja." You will live here again someday. "I want to live with you, Mom." And I want you to live with me, darling. Do you love me? But I don't believe you. And you? Do you think your mother is a failure? I love you, mom. - Right? Do you love me? But I think you hate me. I think you're lying to me. - No. And will you just stick out? You don't think I'm good at anything. Say something! I have a job. The two will stay here for a few days. I can not either. Honey, don't touch. This is mine. Give it to me. Freak! - Like you. You're a complete loser, Andy. I will go. You stay here. - Let me go. This will not happen. "You're silent." You too. I don't want to listen to you. Damn it! Damn it! Your mother is glad you're here. Yes, she is happy. I have no time. I'm going out. I have no desire. You're all rubbish, and you're the biggest. Damn it! I will call you again these days. Don't have a vacancy in the security? Doesn't that suit you? - On the contrary. Andy, do you have time? - When? Now. "Did something happen to Fio?" No, no. Can you help me and watch her? What's wrong? "Maybe I have a job." Yours will probably be happy to hang out here together. No need to know. - I do not have time. I will pay you in installments. I need them all, not a few cents from time to time. I will have them soon. Take care of yourself and the little one. You were very worried. I know the head doesn't listen to you. Take a look. Andy! Andy, I did it. Right? One day the restaurant will be mine. Yes, one day it will be yours. And for! And for! - Dad! Yes it's me. What's happening? Open up. - Dad, we're locked up. Is your mother here? - No. Dad. When did your mother come out? A few days ago. - Do you have food? I asked if you had any food. Did you drink water? Run the tap. What? Mom said she would never come back. Okay, calm down. - Dad. Ronnie, I'm here. How stupid are you really? How wrong are you? Dad! It's not that scary. They will not go to school today. I will condemn you one day. Hello sweetheart. Come on, treasure. Hello. Come on, sweetie. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. You did it. I'm sorry. Don't tease the dogs, Nikki. They will bite you in the face. Step back from the cage. Can they spend the night here? - When? Today? Is it true for the cat? You can leave the children, but you leave. Give up boxing. You are not in good enough shape. She doesn't want you, Andy. You will not return it by letting your head be smashed. We are Family. "Families don't do that." And so it does not happen. Forget her. And so you don't know what you're doing. You just want everyone else to be worse than you. No, I think about them. - Me too. No. You think only of yourself. It's a miracle he got up at all. I don't give up so easily. "They smashed your head." Basilar fracture, boy. Why are you mad at Michael? "Because he's a frustrated jerk." What does "Fruhstiran" mean? It means it's bad. All right, come on in. Why are you looking so serious? Did you get my message? How are you? And more gently inside. What's wrong? Relax. What's happening? Come on. Let's run. Wait. Sonya. Andy, go away. You will ruin everything for me. Please. "Go." Please. - No! Go. What to do? You must help me. OK, come. Shut up. Look at you. Your whole face is dirty. Shut your mouth. Disappear. Don't thank me. The boss is calling you. - Me? Yes. - Now? Yes. Sonya? "Enough." Get out of here, Andy. Why are you doing this? I was fired because of you. I will have the money soon. I will participate in the boxing tournament. In what boxing tournament? You're not all, Andy. I will manage. Wait. I will win it and give you your money back. I need you. And I need someone to offer Fio something. I can. "Mike buys her everything." I can. - You already have everything you need. Wait. You will not ruin everything for me. You will never see Fio again. Left. Well done. Left. Come on, Andy. Keep going. Come on, boy. Very good. You will do it. I wrote a letter to the children's mother. Here it is. Mr. Jovanovic, your children have threatened their classmates with this. And unfortunately, they seem to have stolen money. It seems. "Where did they get the knife?" It's mine. Did you know the kids took it? Not. If you have something like this, you better keep it. All right. Will you give it back to me? - They must bear the consequences. They will not be excluded, but this will not happen to them. We have social workers. They may come to your home. We don't need help. The excursion, that is ... It will be good for the children to come right now. Ronnie and Nikki are always alone. In fact, they have no friends here. If you want, you can go on the trip. But we don't have suitcases. I will buy you. Faster! You are great. Dad, faster! Speed ​​up! Faster! Run. Dad, my stomach hurts. Do you pee? - Yes. Fio, when will he come to us again? I will win the boxing tournament and she will return. Will we be rich? - Yes. Fio doesn't come because he has another father now. Is it true? I will win and she will return. I am her father. I'm coming for the little one. "I won't give it to you." I do not want problems. They pay me for this job and I don't want to lose it. Then I will enter. "Who are you thinking of?" Poor thing. Pick it up. Otherwise they will take it. Where did you get it? "Nikki will take care of him." Ladies and gentlemen, welcome ... Do you see acquaintances? Find a place. The amateur championship has a prize fund of 5,000 euros. Are you alone here? I don't need anyone. I will manage. So no one came. - The children are here. Where? - Somewhere. Everything is fine. What's up? This is Andy Jovanovic. And against him in the blue corner is his opponent Shkodran Haidari! No blows to the head and under the belt. Good luck to both of you. Boxing. Stop. Don't hit it. Stop. Come on, sit down. Breathe slowly. You are not a dog. Breathe slowly. Stay in the middle. Look at him. He's getting tired. Fear grips him. He will lower the guard. Then hit. This is your match. Did you understand me? Seconds to get out of the ring. Finish it. Come on. Boxing. Stop. Boxing. One two three four five six seven... ... eight, nine. The end! I succeeded! I succeeded! Here. Do you feel better? Hey. - Dad. Put them on. "Are we rich?" Are you warm? - A lot. All right. Jovanovic, we will finish you tomorrow. Poor thing. Andy, I need to think about myself. I won the preliminary round. Continue. I found this. We can go on vacation together - you, the children and me. And you want to go on vacation. I'm going to marry Mike. Look at you. Do you really want Fio to be a loser's father? It is too late. Mike has a new job. We're leaving. I am her father. You can't take her like that. It will be better. And Fio will not live with antisocial. Everything is over. They arranged you well. Now it's the Albanian's turn. You look awful now. Give up. In the blue corner is Fatih Balchi. Weighing 89 kg in the red corner is Andi Jovanovic. Stop! You will not fall. Stay straight. Did you hear? Boxing. Stop. Boxing. He will kill me. - You will do it. What will happen to the children? Go. Stay on your feet. You will do it. Stay on your feet. Come on, stand up. Get up. ...two three four... ... Six ... ... seven, eight. All right. Boxing. Victory for the blue corner after giving up. Sonya! Run. Where is the next bus? "For Maastricht." Everything is fine. Everything is fine. I'm hungry. - We are very late. Keep luggage. I'll change her diaper. Damn it. Ronnie! Nicky! Get a serving for your sister too. I'm scared, Dad. Where are we going? Dad!
