(soft music) - Alright! Let's get them calves separated. I don't want to get this herd all riled up now! Come on, let's move it! - Think about that Roy? (laughing) (soft music) - Wilbur, this entire spread just isn't the ranch it once was. You managed to keep afloat this season, but come on now, let's face reality. (coughing) With cattle prices dropping, you'll want to be out of here before the snow falls Wilbur. And we want to buy your ranch, think about it. - The St. Boniface Cattle Company is willing to make a very attractive offer to you Mr. Bennett. - You can tell the St. Boniface Cattle Company they can buy out everybody else, but my land isn't for sale. - We've been associates for 15 years, that must mean something. You've been stewing about this offer for months. With prices what they are, you simply can't compete. This property can support a herd twice your size. - For 15 years I've expected you to keep my business to yourself. - You can still live on the place and keep your money in the bank! I owe you that at least. (coughing) - You don't owe me anything. (dramatic music) (cows mooing) - [James] Roy! - Huh? - Wilbur says to keep 'em as far away from the other bulls as possible. - [Roy] That's what I'm doing, Jimmy. - [Jimmy] Look at 'em boys, $1,000. - Hey bull, I'm gonna need a hand here, Jimmy. - [Jimmy] More than any of you cowpokes will ever make in a lifetime! - [Roy] I want this tan bull out of this corral now. Come on now they'll kill each other if we don't get 'em apart. - Hey Wilbur, makes you think twice about spending a 1,000 bucks on a bull fight, huh? (laughing) - [Man] Get in big fella. - Yah, come on, come on! Move it, move it! Yah, come on! (chatter) - Woo! (horse neighing) - [Man] Get in there. (dramatic music) - [Roy] Wilbur! Look out! - [Wilbur] My father come over from England with nothing. He built this place with his bare hands. He vowed the land'd never be broken up. Got a lot to do still. Won't lose my land. All this trouble. God's way of making me pay for past sins. (soft music) (shallow breathing) - Never shoulda left that bull in the pen so close to the others. - Gimme a hand here. - Oh, yep. - I've had horses roll on top of me. Busted shoulders, and broken legs. And each time I thought I was dying. (chuckles) Oh damn! Guess I'm getting too old. You're the best foreman I've had in years Roy. How much you got put by? - Oh, nothing. - You worried? - No, sooner or later you gotta move on. I figure I've done my time here if you're thinking of selling. - Well I ain't selling and I ain't dead yet. Go open my desk over there. Get me that leather book in front. (soft music) I got a son. I been paying good money to board him for years. Now I need your help. Bring him back here so's we can groom him to take over this place. - Oh no, Wilbur, I don't want to get involved in no family business. I mean, Jimmy and I never see eye to eye. - This place belongs to my son, not my brother Jimmy! Promise me you'll see this through, Roy. - Wilbur, that's like promising the moon. - Promise me. (soft music) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) - [Cab Driver] Where you headed? - [Roy] Picking up a passenger at the Chicago Sanitarium. - [Cab Driver] Don't usually take passengers from there. - [Roy] It's my employer's son, I'm taking him back to Canada. - [Cab Driver] A mighty risky thing you're doing mister. Last one escaped from here set fire to an entire city block. - Terrific. You wait to for me. I shouldn't be too long. I'm here to see Leviatus Bennett. (dramatic music) (soft music) - Dr. Ladreen. - Roy Leckner. Listen, can the boy be ready to go right away? - That all depends, no one enters or leaves here willingly. (shouting patients) Don't be alarmed sir. These are only the sounds of progress. - Oh, good. 'Cause he needs to be of some use doing chores right off. - I'll let you judge for yourself. He came to us as an infant. He has been thoroughly institutionalized. (dramatic music) - [Woman] You can break the glasses but we don't have no food today. (dramatic music) - You can do what you like but it's a sorry doubt this one'll be running any ranches. Put a beggar on horseback and he'll ride it straight into hell. Leviatus! (dramatic music) - Years of confinement makes them unstable. We'll be happy to continue to tend to the boy for a flat fee. - Ah, well, I don't. - They all get three square meals a day here. Plenty of gravy. - Yeah, well, maybe I oughta go back home and discuss this with Wilbur. - Well, you go back and assure Mr. Bennett of our solid care. - [Sophie] Let go of him! (yelling) (dramatic music) - Settle everyone down. - [Orderly] Get the others out, right away. - [Man] Yes sir. (dramatic music) - Home? - Yeah, yeah the boy's home, his father's home. - [Dr. Ladreen] If you require documentation for the Bennetts then we'd be more than fair on the fee. (soft music) - Bring me too. Home please. - [Mrs. McNaish] Mind she's a bit of a sneak, that one. - No, I think we'll be fine. (soft music) (pigs squealing) We ain't riding in here. You're forgetting I paid full fare. - You ride here or you'll stay behind. Your choice. (dramatic music) Those two dimwits ain't allowed to ride in passenger service, railroad by-law. - [Roy] A load of buffalo crap if you ask me. - [Station Manager] I ain't asking you. (dramatic music) - Go on, sit down. It's gotta be like paradise compared to where you've been for the last 10 years. (soft music) (soft music) - Are you offended? You knew your uncle's plan, 12 months as my secretary and then the decision would be mine to make. I never quite intended this moment to be so overwrought. I had merely hoped that I might induce you to be my. - Thank you for your offer, particularly to a woman in my circumstances. But, life here isn't quite what I expected. Whatever the nature of your intentions, I feel you have no business withholding my salary any longer. (coughing) Mr. Bennett! You're supposed to be convalescing not running around like a yearling. - I've got to speak to Sir Robert right away. - Of course you can. He's in the back office. (soft music) - You're playing God Wilbur. You can't expect simply to will a young boy to a hired hand. - I want you to witness this Butler. Support the contents of that will, support my son. Anything happens to him and my entire estate forfeits to the government. - You could sell for a princely sum and leave the boy properly looked after for the rest of his days. - I can't let go of my land, even if I wanted to. Don't fail me Robert Butler. We've been honest associates for 15 years. You owe me. - Only the strong have a right to survive Wilbur. Yours is the choicest piece of property. I'm warning you. Your brother Jimmy will weasel his way in and the place will be bankrupt within a year. And I'll have no trouble picking it up at the bank for the price of the mortgage. - Damn you, if you want it that badly. - I will witness your will, Mr. Bennett. - You've forgotten the spirit that opened up this country Sir Robert. Much indebted to you Miss. (dramatic music) - I am afraid I don't speak your language sir. - Don't ever confuse madness with integrity, my dear. Thank you for minding my affairs. (dramatic music) (horse neighing) (distant train horn blowing) - Good morning Mr. Bennett. - Morning. A telegram to Mr. Royal Leckner, Four Arrows Ranch to be delivered upon his arrival in a couple of days. - [Ticket Master] Right Mr. Bennett. Telegram for Mr. Roy Leckner when he returns from Chicago. (soft music) - And I want this sent registered mail. (horn blowing) (soft music) ♪ Hey ya ♪ ♪ Hey ya hey ho ♪ ♪ Hey ya hey ya hey ho ♪ ♪ Hey ya hey ya ♪ (soft music) - I hate women who chew tobacco. It ain't right. (indigenoua music) Oh, for God sake, there you go. Just don't let me watch you chew it. (indigenous music) Get out of my pocket! For God sake. (indigenous music) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (man clearing throat) - You've missed the last three trains. Aren't you going to buy a ticket dear? - No, I'm going to sit here until Robert Butler pays me every nickel he owes me. - [Ticket Master] Ah, Sir Robert, you received my message, I see. - Let me see that telegram. - [Ticket Master] Mr. Leckner should be on the next train. - Mr. Butler, I have no intentions of leaving this town until you pay me my wages. I shall continue to wait in public places until you comply and I want you to know that. (dramatic music) - I'd like to purchase full fare passage to the Maritimes and make arrangements for steamship passage to Folkestone England. Bill it to my office. That should be about the equivalent for services rendered. (train horn blowing) Mr. Royal Leckner! - Robert. (dramatic music) - I have some unfortunate news. Wilbur Bennett died from a stroke two days ago. - Ah, damn! - He didn't suffer. - Well what the deuce am I supposed to do now? - The telegraph office had this for you. Curiously Wilbur cabled you the day that he died. He made a provision in his will that you accept custody of his son, Leviatus Bennett. - Yeah. - His sole legal heir? You'll pardon my opening your cable. But I feel a tremendous responsibility towards his affairs. He came to discuss things with me that morning. Were you unsuccessful at finding the lad? - Yeah. No, no, no, no. He's. It's okay Sophie, you can come on out. We're here. (indigenous music) - Dear God. Clearly no one could advise Wilbur on anything with much success. (indigenous music) Wilbur told me that you had agreed to take over the ranch, until the drive. - Yeah, 500 buck bonus for keeping the books, and paying the loan at season's end. And then I just hand over the land to the boy. - Of course if you were unable to pay back the loan the property would revert back to our bank. The Bank would be quite prepared to offer you the 500 now, to save the embarrassment of everyone going through such a ridiculous exercise. - Ah, no. No I can't, it says here I'm to maintain control of the cash and the ranch, anything happens to the boy the land reverts to the Dominion of Canada. - This will be called Wilbur Bennett's greatest tragedy. His utter lack of vision will leave the boy destitute. - Well now, I've got no intention of being that boy's guardian. I just need some time to figure things out for him. (soft music) - The Commercial Bank will happily take possession. No need to involve the Dominion of Canada. - I'll keep that in mind Sir Robert. (dramatic music) - I'd like to cash this ticket please. - Our policy doesn't allow that Miss. I'm afraid I have to speak to Sir Robert Butler. - Well, you just do that. (upbeat music) - Woo! (laughs) Did you see that? Hey look. - Come on, let's go, we're home. - [Jimmy] You heard? - Yeah I heard. This here is Wilbur's son, he's from Chicago. What're you celebrating? - A son? My brother never had no son. - How would you know? You weren't here 15 years ago. I picked up a cable he sent me before he died. This property is left to the boy. - You're nuts! A kid can't run a ranch here! You tryna pull a fast one Roy, cooking up something stupid tryna to get rid of me? - You can read, can't you? (laughter) - What? Who the hell is this squaw here Roy? Is she Wilbur's too? - No, she's not Wilbur's, She's his supervisor. - Now is this some kind of a joke, Roy? This land is mine. Don't you get your hopes up, 'cause come Monday morning I got the for sale signs up. (firing his gun) Woo-wee, hoo-hoo! - Alright, let's get a couple of things straight! Leviatus Bennett here, is the new owner of this ranch. Wilbur made it clear it was his birthright. Anything happens to the boy, the land reverts to the government of Canada. There's a proper will in the bank in town. Now, you all got the same jobs you always had. That's the way Wilbur wanted it. That's the way I want it. Anybody got any problems with the way things is run, you come talk to me. Frenchy, Charlie, you come and help me get these two cleaned up. James, you gather up a crew and go check the water and the herd down in the southwest. - Hey you can't prove that boy's even related to me. - Jimmy, you listen to me. A son is a son, what do you expect me to say? I don't want Wilbur's problems or this land neither but I got no choice. - You'll never be the boss here Roy. And you'll never make a Bennett out of him! - We all gotta stick together Jimmy, move out! (dramatic music) - Thank you. (upbeat music) Mr. Leckner! I saw you having difficulty in town today and I thought that there may be a job for me here. - Excuse me. - I've just left Robert Butler's employment. - [Roy] Excuse me. (laughter) Alright, alright, alright. What the heck is goin' on now? - [Frenchy] She thinks we're trying to drown the little beggar! - Get over there. Come on. Nobody's trying to hurt the kid. He's tryna give him a bath. The water's not that deep. (speaking foreign language) - What'd she say? - You first. Alright hold onto that Charlie. You first. You can either live with lice or you can drown them, like this. There, you see it's not that deep at all. Come on in. I'm sorry Miss Makepeace, as you can see we're a little busy right now. - It's alright, it's alright. Look, why don't you get your bath things? - It's alright. - [Jane] What's your name? - Sophie. - [Jane] Sophie and? - Levi. - Right Sophie and Levi, come on. (soft music) It's alright, it's not very deep. Come on you might like it, just try. Just a lovely bath. (laughs) Good luck. I could help you with these two. - Charlie, why don't you go on up to the grub line? The crew'll be eating the floorboards if supper ain't ready in short order, go on. - I could help in the kitchen. - I've never needed no help before. Frenchy, come and gimme a hand with the firewood. (laughing) - Mr. Leckner, I witnessed Mr. Bennett's will the day that he died. When I saw you in town today, I thought that. Look, I've barely enough money to pay my way back East and I'm in no position to ask for anything other than my keep. But I learned a lot about ranches when I. Please don't look at me as if I have two heads Mr. Leckner, I can help you with this place. - Well, I'm a bit like Charlie. I don't need no help, thanks. - Do you know how to keep a set of books? - Yeah, some. - Can you prove to the bank that this ranch will be in profit at season's end? I know the cattle business inside out. I know every drover's trick, every speculator's gimmick. Do you own a radio? - A radio? No, I don't own a radio. - Well then immediately you're at a disadvantage when selling your herd to drovers. Cattle prices, they fluctuate so quickly nowadays. Newspapers are always out of date. - Y'know, you're awfully confident. - Actually I'm shaking like a leaf. But when I saw you there today, I thought there might be a position for me here, of some kind. - Well, why don't you take your stuff on up to the house, and then come down and try and get these two cleaned up. You can join us for supper. - Well, you'll let me stay, won't you? - I ain't said yes to anything. I gotta think this whole thing through. Go on up to the house and find yourself some overalls, will ya? (upbeat music) (laughing) (upbeat music) - Mr. Leckner's given me leave to help look after your new tenants. (upbeat music) Right well, can you tell me where I'm to put my things please? And I'll need some clean overalls for Sophie and Levi. - Take any room you want, I guess. 'Cept the big room, that's for the kid, since he's the boss. - Well, where's Sophie supposed to sleep? - Lady all I do is cook. The rest of it's up to you. I mean, I don't know anything about this. You might find something in there that'll fit that squaw. - Alright, thank you. (soft music) (sighs) (clears throat) (dramatic music) - [Cowboy] Come get a hold of her, quick! (gunshot) Come on! - Kid broke into the bunkhouse, stole my goddam Winchester! Little Jay tried to get it off him and the squaw here hit him with a rock. - Hold off for crying out loud! Gimme that! You listening to me? You don't play with a bloody rifle. It ain't a toy, you understand me? (dramatic music) - I say string her up! She coulda killed Jay. - Mr. Leckner stop this stupidity! - String her up, like we used to do in Texas. - Why don't you get off of this spread Jimmy Bennett? - What the hell you talking about? You can't fire me. This ain't your land buddy, it's my land. - Yeah, well right, why don't you go into the bunk house and grab your bedroll and whatever possessions are rightfully yours and you leave before I rip this head off the rest of your worthless body? (dramatic music) You gave the kid the gun. He ain't smart enough to take what doesn't belong to him. - This ain't even Wilbur's son. What's your name kid? Come on, what's your name, huh? - Remember, if anything happens to that boy, this land reverts to the government of Canada. (soft music) Jay, don't you get him his horse? Miss Makepeace, you want to get them inside? - Gimme that. - Anybody got a problem with the way I run things? - [Cowboy] Nope. - This ain't over Leckner. It ain't over. (things on the ground clanking) Damn. (soft music) - Come Sophie. (laughing) Look, you must be exhausted. Come on upstairs, it's time. Levi? (playing notes on piano) Levi! (speaking foreign language) - He don't hear. - He doesn't hear? (pressing foot pedal on piano) (speaking foreign language) He feels vibrations? - He hear what you think. (soft music) (playing notes on piano) (soft music) (men chatting) - [ Roy] Charlie. - Some of the men took off their leave when Jimmy took off. - Mex? - Only an idiot works for an idiot. - A job's a job Mex. You won't be coming back. Always somebody to fill it. - Next thing you'll be hiring chippys and school marms to work this dump. (squealing) (laughing) - Sit down! (dramatic music) - I don't think they're used to beds. - I can't imagine why. - There's a guest room for you upstairs. I've put fresh linen on the bed. I think Levi and Sophie should dine in here from now on. And you're going to have to prohibit the use of spirits, those men had been drinking all afternoon. - You listen to me. That squaw had about as much to do with things this afternoon as any of them boys. With all the hoopla going on around here, we're just gonna have to make do. - I'm just trying to ascertain what's in Levi's best interests. - Who's interests? I decided I don't need your help. I shouldn't be in here. I should be in the bunkhouse with the boys. And he shouldn't be here neither, he should be. - What? Back in the institution? - Well, anywhere than here. I expect you to clear out in the morning. - You're not being fair! And Sophie would be more civilized if your men treated her with some respect. - Yeah well I'm civilized enough to know what's right and what's wrong. Why don't you leave a body in peace? Go on. (upbeat music) - What the? Well, that's my property! - Mr. Leckner and I came to an agreement last night, everyone working on the ranch will just have to make do. Please inform the men. - You stay out of my kitchen! - We shall dine in the main house from now on, and I shall prepare the meals. Good morning Charlie. (upbeat music) Yes that's right, now hold that there, right. - I told you to clear out of here. I did not tell you to clear out our liquor supply. I just lost five more men who up and quit on me! And I had to scrape Charlie off of the ceiling for crying out loud! Let me spell it out for you, you got no business, what the hell are you doing now? - We're learning table manners. - Oh, you're learning table manners? If you think you're gonna be around here long enough to teach these. - Levi can lip read to a certain extent. And they've developed a sort of sign language they use between them. - Oh, that's terrific. - Do you want to know Levi's sign for you? - Well, seeing as we're all here! - Levi, who's that? Watch this. Who's that? You're Big Hat Man. - Oh, terrific. Has he got a name for you, too? - I don't know. Levi, Levi. (laughing) Big Hat Woman, I believe. - Ah, Levi wants to ride the (speaking foreign language) - A what? - It's Ojibway, it means horse. It means an animal with one nail. He wants to ride a horse. (speaking foreign language) (laughing) (speaking foreign language) Ojibway, gotta helluva sense of humor. It's a lotta dirty jokes. - Oh I see. - No, I don't think you do see. - Watch how quickly he learns. Just watch, please. Levi come on, come on, show him what you can do. Alright, now watch me. Horse, horse. - Hor, ho. Hor. - Feel here, feel here. Horse, horse. (laughs) Horse, that's it! Isn't he wonderful? - He's miraculous. - I'm sure he could ride a horse of you showed him how. Do you want to ride a horse Levi? Ride a horse, like a cowboy? Horse, that's right, horse. - He hasn't a clue of what you're talking about. I can't afford to lose any more men on account a you. So, like I said last night. (gasps) (dramatic music) - [Sophie] Levi, no! - [Jane] Sophie! You must explain to him that we are not angry, Sophie make him stop. (soft music) - The boy's afraid of his own shadow. - Mr. Leckner, help get him out. He could be crushed under all this wood. - Come here. - Can you treat him gently? - [Roy] He needs is to be treated like a 15 year old boy. Not coddled like a soft-boiled egg. Come here, get, get, come on. - Don't be so mean. - [Roy] Alright, fine, you try. Come on. - [Jane] Come on out. It's alright, no one's going to hurt you. It's only me. - Just push him out with your feet for crying out loud. - [Jane] I've got him, there you go. - [Roy] I've got him, I've got him. - [Jane] Don't be so rough. - [Roy] Come here, come on. (soft music) (dramatic music) (yelling) - [Jane] Mr. Leckner, help! - [Roy] Just hold on. - [Jane] Oh for heaven sake, get me out! - I've a good mind to leave you in there. - [Jane] Hurry! (upbeat music) - Whoa, whoa, whoa. (upbeat music) - Well, you look as though you're digging your way out of this mess, Leckner. The station manager referred your inquiry to me. The least I can do is offer you the stipend to which you were entitled when you came out here, as I'm sure you'll need it now. - Thank you. But let me say it is I who owe you. I intend to invest it, in this ranch. - Your uncle warned me about your penchant for lost causes. You couldn't do better than here. I've written him of your whereabouts and explained that I have relinquished all responsibility for you. You would be wise to do the same, my offer still stands. - Yeah? - Jimmy Bennett and a few others of your crew have drifted over to work with us at the St. Boniface ranch. Rather be up front. Don't want any hard feelings, you'll learn all that in business, nothing that isn't for sale. - I never had no airs about learning business. - That boy's a Bennett. (dramatic music) He ought to have the best hat in the place. (dramatic music) - That ain't a working hat, Sir Robert. - Now that's your trouble Roy, always thinking small. (dramatic music) - Go on back to work. What're you all gawking at? You mind telling me what any of this has to do with your family? - Both of my parents are dead. My relatives turned their backs on me. Robert Butler told my uncle he had a job for me here in Canada. Like a fool I came here hoping for a way out. Butler had other ideas. He'd buy you too, if he could. - Hasn't got the better of me yet. - You didn't mean everything you said last night, did you? - Look, when I was that kid's age I was on my own. I never raised anybody before. As far as I'm concerned, if you expect to spend another day on this ranch you'll leave the decision making to me. Alright Levi. (upbeat music) (speaking foreign language) (laughing) (upbeat music) - $150, here. I'll keep track of it in the ledger. You can add it to the operating cash in exchange for room and board. - Ooh, now hold. - No, I won't be gotten rid of as easily as Robert Butler would like. (upbeat music) - Miss Makepeace. - I've had a good look at the books, Mr. Leckner. How many steers do you think the ranch can ship this year? - Oh, many as we can find. Some years we don't find them all, and we lose some along the trail, drowned, or wolves. - Well, even if you shipped the cattle directly to the rail head, the best price would be $35 to $40 a head. And for Four Arrows to pay off its current debt, it would have to ship a minimum of 800 steers this fall. - 800? Well, we ain't shipped 800 steers in any year I been here. 700 two years ago. - I've also tallied up the working cash. How many men do you intend to hire? - Why don't you leave the ranching to me, Miss Makepeace? - If you think you can only deliver 700 cattle then we have to raise their weight to make a better profit. I was thinking that grain is at an all time low. Maybe we could take the risk and barter with the bank for their bankrupt grain elevators. - Grain, now what do you want with grain? - To feed the cattle, Mr. Leckner. Fatten them up to $60, $70 a head. - You wanna feed the grain to the cattle. Come on. - What are you so afraid of? - Losing this place through mistakes, is what. - Why do you think Robert Butler is so eager to get his hands on this property? He has the foresight to see what nobody else can see. He sees the ranch land surrounding Butler Hills as fields and fields of grain. Grain is a much more marketable commodity than cattle, Mr. Leckner. - Well, I know this country and I know cattle. Why don't you keep your nose in the books, huh? (soft music) (dramatic music) (chatter) - [Man] What kind of monsters you keeping out there Roy? We don't want no crazy people running around this community. Now you better keep them locked up. - Ah heck, I've hired cowpokes who are crazier than them two. Heck, you did some work for us awhile back, didn't you Dutchie? Huh? I'm looking for top men, top wages. I'm driving 500 head to market this fall, I can guarantee 2 1/2 months work. - I heard you got a woman out there running things. - What's the matter, Dutchie, you scared of girls? - Sorry Roy, some of us got work here for awhile. We don't want no grudges held if Jimmy Bennett gets the ranch back. - I'm paying $5 a week with a $20 end of season bonus. - Butler's offering $7 a week out at St. Boniface. - It's a good ranch, good wages. But they don't need no more hands out there. And there's no bonus. Our bonus is worth their 10 weeks extra pay. After that you can stay on if you so choose, at regular wages. Got any takers? Come on and sign up. - You're being awful free with that boy's money. - You know what I heard? That woman out there's an heiress. She got a stack of bills, as thick as flies on a dead Indian. - Well, you go back! And you tell Jimmy he's got it just about right! Top wages fellas. All the beef you can chew. - [Man] I'm in. (upbeat music) - That kid spooks me. (upbeat music) - Hold your water Jay. (upbeat music) - No sir, I don't like it one bit. - Why don't you go up to the bunkhouse and bring out lunch? Haying crew can eat out here. (soft music) - [Man On Radio] Now, let's turn to our farm report. And we'll begin with beef. Word's not good for ranchers. Cattle prices fell again this week as major trading came to a standstill at stockyards in the Midwest. Beef is down three cents in just two days. That's not good. Calves are at prices not seen since before the war. Many ranch owners are forecasting doom and gloom. And that goes for a few that I know as well. Most are worried that prices will never go back up and may continue to slide. And now on the agricultural front. - Hey, don't shake the reins so badly! That horse don't want to go that fast. (dramatic music) - I only want what's rightfully mine, sir. And I sincerely believe that Roy Leckner tricked my brother just to get his own foot in the door. - That may very well be. The reason I asked you here was to express concern about the nonsense going on at Four Arrows. - We have to do everything in our power to get Leckner out of there. And then maybe we'll be able to give Jimmy his due. - The bank can't be seen to be in the middle of this. But you can be of tremendous assistance to us, Mr. Bennett. Do we understand each other? - It won't, it won't take much to just push 'em right over the edge. - See how well you do with Four Arrows, and perhaps you can be of assistance to us on some other properties that are having a hard time. - Yes sir, yes, yes sir. Sir. - Good bye. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (excited chatter) - Watch that huh? Oughta try him with a lasso. (upbeat music) - [Roy] Where the hell have you been? - Cattle trading prices fell badly today. I used the $150 to hold a 1,000 bushels of grain. - Whoa! That money's been spent. I committed every bit of our extra operating cash on bonuses and haying pay. And I told you cattle don't eat grain. You fatten cattle on hay! - Couldn't you have asked me? - Ask you? You're supposed to be asking me! You're supposed to be keeping track of the books not spending the money! - You told me there'd be no operating bonuses up front. Uncommit immediately. - And lose all of these cowpokes and our reputation? - How much have you got to get by? - I don't know, maybe a 100, maybe a little more. And there's my bonus, depending on how much cash we have left to pay the bank loan at the end of the drive. - You may have to use it all to pay off the bank loan. - What the heck makes you such an expert on everything? Why don't you lay off of this high rolling deal crap! - We'll never get out of this mess. (soft music) - Listen, we'll fatten the calves on the grain you bought. And with all the railways coming through, the crew'll need meat. And maybe we can sell direct to the railway. (scoffing) - You really do believe we'll make it don't you? - As long as I can count on you. (soft music) - Care to take a step, ma'am? (laughing) - I certainly would. And don't call me ma'am. It makes me feel a 100. - [Man] Oh, aha Jim. (upbeat music) (cheers) (upbeat music) - Here. If you give it to him like this, he'll snap your finger off. You give it to him like that. It's the only way he can eat it without taking a piece of your finger. Alright? Give it a try. It's okay. (soft music) - [Cowboy] Alright, you heard the man. Come on boys let's call it a night, enough's enough. - Gotta get you guys breakfast, you just ate me out of house and home. (soft music) What, What? Okay. Well, I'm glad to see you finally found something you're good for around here. Well good night Sophie. (soft music) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - Save us. (yelling) (dramatic music) - Fire in the chicken coop! (dramatic music) Bring the hose! (dramatic music) (yelling) (dramatic music) - My God! Levi get the livestock out of the barn! (soft music) - [Hand] The smoke must have got her, she's suffocating. - [Roy] Sophie! (soft music) Sophie! Sophie! (soft music) (coughing) How did this happen? (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (rooster crowing) What is it? - Bunch of 'em want their pay. - They want what? - Well, they say they're done, the place is jinxed. - Well, you go back there and you tell them no. They want their pay they stay until the hay is in. It's our original deal. - Well, they seem so worried I think they'll go anyway. - Little Jay, why don't you ask them if they know something we don't? I gotta feeling this weren't no accident. Go on. Damn! - Sir Robert and the Board of Directors have given me strict instructions that I cannot possibly sell an elevators worth of grain for so little, especially since they predict the price of grain is on the up swing. I'm sorry but I've been instructed to keep the 150 you put down against the grain purchase in order to pay down Four Arrows current debt. - How dare you? - Four Arrows' loan repayment is due October 7th. - We're well aware of that. That money will be on this desk with pleasure. Miss Makepeace. - Thieves! (dramatic music) - Good day. (soft music) - Roy! You know people are saying that the boy is a pariah. Why not come ride with us? Get back to what you do best. Always need good cowboys at the St. Boniface Ranch! (dramatic music) - I know what you are Robert Butler! And if I were a man I'd rip your bloody voice box out of your throat. (soft music) She protected him all these years, held him back in her own way. (soft music) - Come on son. You can't stay out here day in, day out. Come on, come on. (soft music) (dramatic music) Well, we best finish her off tonight. No telling how long this rain'll hold off. We need a good crop for the winter if God and cattle prices don't cooperate by the end of the drive. And so long as we don't loose anymore of our hired hands. - [Man] Fire, fire, help! (bell ringing) - Let's ride over there, see if they need some help. - [Man] Fire! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - How the hell did it go up so fast? - Used green timber. That's a new barn. Only a crazy man would do this! - Oh, now Elliott, come on now, be reasonable. - Everyone around here knows about that boy. Squaw's dead eh? He burned her to death didn't he? - Listen, I'm really sorry about your barn, but you best stop listening to rumors. You let us know what you need, we'll be pleased to help out. - Get that boy off my land. - You folks done enough already. (dramatic music) - 'Bout time someone picked up all this stuff. Been sitting there for weeks. No one's been near this wicket since Mr. Bennett, you know. - Yes well, we appreciate your informing us. - This one's registered for Mr. Leckner. - I can sign for that. - Signing everything for Mr. Leckner these days? - No, just the things I am asked to sign for, thank you. (soft music) Dear Mr. Leckner, please find enclosed a key for Mr. Wilbur Bennett's safety deposit box at the Consumer's Bank in Butler Hills. Mr. Bennett has asked us as trustees to forward it to you for safe keeping and to allow you access to a certain sum of money contained therein that was promised to you. (soft music) - I am sorry Mr. McNabb. But management at head office has given me strict instructions to foreclose. - We've got six months of hay and grain coming in from the outer barns. - You've lost a third of your herd in that brush fire. Maybe you should look to the kid over at Four Arrows! Nevertheless with cattle prices this low the bank just can't afford to take a chance and let you keep the place running. - You can take your notice of auction and do what you care with it! (dramatic music) - Mr. McNabb! Mr. McNabb, I couldn't help but overhear. - Well, they'll not take what's illegally theirs. I've got 'til October like everybody else to pay back my loan. Brush fires took out a 100 head. - I think that bank has more to do with fire than free enterprise. - Aye. And the Anderson's blame that boy. I've heard tales of raped women and ax murders out at Four Arrows but you look to be in one piece. - Mr. McNabb, I wonder if you could help us? All the ranchers around here need to band together. Do you think you could talk to the other ranchers? - Yah! Yah! Whoa, whoa! (dramatic music) You want to get the front foot first. Noose on. Then, one, two, and three, through. (soft music) Now take it off. That's it. (soft music) - Looks like you've got a shadow. - Yeah, we'll need him. Five of them drifters left after we finished the haying. - Well, McNabb and I agreed the first thing we have to do is call a meeting. - Oh yeah? Between who, you and God? (laughing) - No, between all the neighbors, smart alec. Who need to understand Butler's ambitions for their property. - Well, I got enough work to do to get through to the drive. I don't need to involve myself in other people's problems. - But even if we can make it through this season, where will that leave us? Butler will always try to foreclose. - Men like him don't give a hoot about people's livelihoods. Neither do the banks. It's just a game, that's all. Mass farming, maximum profit, and they convert everyone's ranch land to grain. - You know how long I been on this land? 10 years, I was working at the stable in town when Wilbur hired me. Only hand he ever had, with a grade five education. Took me every place he went, told everybody I was gonna be his top hand. I guess he felt so bad about leaving you as a baby he could never face you as a man. I just wish he'd given himself the chance. I've never known much more than this land and the livestock on it. Wilbur neither. You two make a good pair, you never see fences only open prairie. (soft music) - Wilbur left a key in some registered mail at the station. I found your bonus in his safety deposit box. - Yeah well, I'm not in the habit of collecting on a bonus before the job's done. That money belongs to the ranch. Just put that in the cash box. Got a long way to go before that kid can run this place. - Wilbur knew that you'd take care of him. - I don't think I'd know how to leave this place. - You'll speak to the neighbors then? - Yeah, I'll talk to them. I don't know if they'll listen, but I'll talk to them. Don't you worry about that. (soft music) - [Jane] There you go. - Thank you. (soft music) What do you think Ollie? (horse neighs) (upbeat music) - Howdy, ma'am. - Good to see you ma'am, good day. (chatter) - Alright, let's not waste time getting down to matters. - Then tell us who's been starting all them fires there, Roy? - Oh, I could stand here all afternoon surmising about that. But I figure you'd probably like the main act at the Chautauqua a whole lot better. We're not here to talk about disaster, we're here to talk about cattle. As you know, cattle prices have been plummeting and what I want to do this afternoon is discuss what plans any of you come up with, help us all out. - My missus figured up last night that with what we owe on the herd we'd be better off killing 'em all, selling the hides and burying the carcasses before the banks foreclose. - Well that's a little drastic. I was figuring on driving our herd over to the rail head at Pendleton as soon as I can, see if I can't get a better price dealing direct with the stockyard. - It's a 100 miles to Pendleton! How you gonna move your big herd with just a hand full of men this year, huh? Folks are curious? - What if we were to pool our herds together and use everybody's crew and sell all the cattle at Pendleton for one huge sale. (chatter) Your land is your lifeblood. You've raised your families on it, you've buried them as God saw fit. It's returned a lot to all of us, as much if not more than the blood and sweat we've put into it. But to a bank your land is worth nothing more than a piece of paper on which to collect interest. But it's worth a whole lot more to people like Robert Butler who are anxious to speculate in grain. Makepeace. - I know this because I've worked for him. The small cattle rancher doesn't matter anymore. The big money lies in mass farming, because grain can be shipped easily around the world to places like Britain that can't feed themselves right now. And they'll pay any price. Your financial solvency doesn't mean anything to someone like Robert Butler. If you want to hold onto your land, we have to stick together. - How many head would it take to make a direct sale this season to one of the meat packers themselves Miss? - Now what if we were to sell direct to Waverly Meats and bypass the stockyards completely? - Now, I've dealt many times with Waverly Meats when I was working for Robert Butler. I'm sure I could speak to Mr. Waverly and get us a minimum guarantee before we drive the herd. (excited chatter) - If you agree to allow Four Arrows to be your agent, I will organize the drive of the herds. Any takers? - I say we do as they says. We all go with Leckner. (chattering agreement) - Mr. Waverly, I. No, I don't think Robert Butler would know how to compete in a situation like this. Yes it is. It's a very unique situation, yes. $39 a head? Right, yes. Some of the herd will be of superior weight and quality, look what about $45 to $50 a head? Some flexibility, yes. Alright, alright. No, no thank you Mr. Waverly. I'll await your confirming cable here at the hotel. - It'll be close, real close. 63 men for only 8,000 head of cattle. Oh God. - We can do it! Get a gang like this behind you, we'll be buying Butler out before long. - Looks like Wilbur backed the right horse. You're doing alright Roy. (soft music) Butler explained to me about the will. Turns out he knew about Wilbur's son all these years. Anyway, Butler and I kinda came to blows. He never made good on some of his promises and threw some of us off the job. Cut backs, that sort of thing. - So we heard. Come on, let's go. (dramatic music) - I really feel like a bit of a fool, after everything I said Roy. But I figured maybe you could use a couple a more hands? - I don't want no trouble Jimmy. You'd get no better treatment from me than you got under Wilbur, you understand? - Roy, I'd be happy if you'd just give me another chance. Find another place for me, and I won't, I won't make no stink about no will, no sir. - Who else you got? - I got Dutch, and Frenchy and Mexican Jack, and we won't accept no wages, not unless you make a profit. - Why don't you show up in the morning. We'll be driving out within the week. - You won't be disappointed Roy, no sir. And Miss Makepeace. (soft music) (dramatic music) - Alright boys, get 'em up to the pastures on the far west side. Move steady and don't spook 'em. Just keep 'em at a walk. You get 'em running, they lose weight. We want 'em fat and happy when we reach Pendleton! We'll round up the Four Arrows stock, pick up the rest of the ranches' cattle along the way. (dramatic music) You're the boss. Now that's a real working hat. - [Levi] Boss. - Yah! Let's go! (upbeat music) That's it, that's it, that's a good pace. (upbeat music) Whoa slow down. We're gonna take it nice and slowly. Take the flank and push 'em that way, but nice and steady. We're gonna take it slow and easy. (upbeat music) - [Jane] How do you know we're going to find 700? - [Roy] We'll get 'em. There's a group of them now. We'll round these up to the main herd, then I'll circle back and pick up the rest. Yah, yah, yah. Yah! (upbeat music) Let's get this herd moved down to the watering hole. (upbeat music) - Here. You have to drink water. (upbeat music) - We'll let the herd and horses have their drink. And we'll set up camp on the top of that hill. Oh my God, them birds! This water's poison! Let's turn that herd around. (dramatic music) (whistling) Turn 'em from the water! Turn around! Keep 'em away from the water! (soft music) What did you put in the water? - What? I don't know what you are talking about, Roy. - I know you Jimmy, Robert Butler can buy men who'll do just about anything. - Yeah? (laughing) - I bet he doesn't even have to pay you to do his bidding, does he? - Not like he has to pay little Miss Makepeace over here. You go on, you ask her. He sure does like to buy a lot of people. Come on, knock it off Roy. I ain't about to sabotage you. We shared some good laughs together, didn't we? He never will believe that I'm anything other than a bad influence. Will you? - What did he mean by Butler buying you? What exactly were you doing with Butler? - You should be asking what the hell he was doing with me. - Well, I'm not interested in him. I'm listening. (dramatic music) - I was very well brought up, in a very proper British family. My parents were killed in India. I was taken back to England by an uncle who was in the British Army. But when I returned, I found the rules of society no longer applied. I'd been taken advantage of. And I was with child in that nightmare. I lost the baby on my return. When my aunt found out, she insisted that I be sent away. Butler and my uncle, being old army chums, made arrangements for me to come out here. If things went well with Butler, he was entitled to have me to himself. - I'm sorry. This ain't none of my business. - No please, forgive me. (soft music) (dramatic music) - [Ranch Hand] Get up there come on get up. (dramatic music) (soft music) (dramatic music) - [Cowboy] Whoa, come on! (dramatic music) (coughing) - I seen this kinda thing before. Might have punctured a lung. We'll get him to a doctor as soon as we hit Pendleton. (coughing) If he doesn't come through in the next little while. (soft music) Excuse me. (soft music) (dramatic music) - [Orderly] There's been an accident here! Over here! - [Roy] Alright Levi. (soft music) - Take him over there! I need to stay with the boy. I'm afraid he's not good. This should suppress the coughing, and hopefully we can stop the bleeding. - If that boy dies no one is going to live on Four Arrows. Everyone will have to clear off the property at once. - Now, that's not what we agreed to here. - You've bungled this yourself James. This goes to the very heart of the question of the ownership of the property, if that boy dies the land is forfeit to the Crown. It'll take me years to sort this out. Your brother was right, you're good for very little. - Now, I won't be kept out of this! That's my land! - I have no further obligations to you. Drive the truck back to the Hills office and collect your time. The manager there will speak to you. (soft music) - [Doctor] We'll just keep this on a few more minutes, and keep me posted, nurse. - We'll give you $45 on the Archer and Big Marvel stocks and half the Four Arrows stocks. $42 on the Double Y stock, $40 on the Brianbrook and Red River stocks. $39 on all other ranches, with 10% dockage, please note that Reg. - We never discussed dockage Mr. Waverly. - We've got at least two days moving these herds by rail before they're slaughtered. - Yes well, that's ridiculous. They're not going to lose 10% of their weight. - Standard practice Miss. You know it as well as I do. Now, you people have done well with this deal. - Just a minute Mr. Waverly. The bank wishes to be certain these property owners settle their debts before any of these herds are dispersed. - None of these ranches can afford 10% dockage. How about 5% dockage and a guarantee on our community's entire herd next year? - I'm sorry, but if there are problems with the bank we won't touch any of this proposition. Now I'm sorry, I wash my hands of this deal. - Mr. Waverly this is ridiculous. They can't stop us selling! (dramatic music) - [Jimmy] Levi Bennett? - [Nurse] Yes, upstairs and down the hall. (dramatic music) - It'll not be said that Waverly Meats didn't offer a fair price. But this is not an auction, meet my terms. - We came here, and we intend to sell. Now tell Robert Butler and his bank to stay out of our affairs. (crowd agreeing) - We intend to appropriate these properties and you can't presume to negotiate for something that isn't yours, Miss Makepeace. - As far as Four Arrows goes, we need to speak to the owner. - I represent the owner. (dramatic music) (soft music) Mr. Waverly, we accept your 10% dockage if you'll hold it as a lien against next year's drive. - [Man] That's fine with me. I think we can do that. (cheers) (dramatic music) - Excuse me, please. The others may get through this. But Four Arrows will be lost if Leviatus dies. (dramatic music) - Get out. - I just came to say so long to Levi. - I said get out! (dramatic music) - What happened? - Sorry about your window. - We can settle things between us. (dramatic music) Come back! I said come back! (dramatic music) - [Jane] The doctor says you have to build up your strength. You've got to get better, so you can come home. (soft music) - I know I been harsh with you, it ain't ever been easy for me to say things out of my heart. I ain't never had no kin before. The two of you're like flesh and blood to me now. Well, I guess we finished what we started, Jane. The best we could. (soft music) (upbeat music) Who from? - My cousins. They want me to go back to England. My uncle's died. And it seems they were always embarrassed by his sending me here. My parents had some property that can be sold. I'm the beneficiary. - It sounds like it oughta fetch enough to have a different life than here. You'll be going then? - I want to stay. I can invest in the ranch. - Now, hold on just a minute. - What? We'll plant grain and wheat next year. Use the money to build this place. - You are going to kill yourself, and me. (laughing) (cheers) (soft music) (cheers) (upbeat music) (cheers and applause) - He's terrific. (soft music) (soft music)
