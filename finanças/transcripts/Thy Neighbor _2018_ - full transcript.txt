Thanks for calling the Reynolds. Please leave a message. Hey there, Zach Reynolds, this is Pastor Jim of Life House Church. Actually I guess I should say, Pastor Zach Reynolds. I’m very pleased to let you know that the board meeting just wrapped, and they’ve loved your messages on loving your neighbor. We cannot wait to hear the rest of the series. You’ve been unanimously selected for the pastor position, brother. So say goodbye to that boring West Coast. Anyway, welcome to the beautiful Midwest. We’ll see you when you get here, God bless. Welcome home, Reynolds family. We weren’t expecting you till later tonight. Pastor Zach. Hey, it’s good to see you. - Good to see you. Here are the keys. I was just tidying up a bit. If you have any issues, just let me know. - Definitely. - You must be Amber. - Hi. - Pastor Zach told us so many wonderful things about you. - Oh, Pastor Zach. - We just love your book. We gave a copy to everyone in the church. Your story, it’s so inspiring. I heard you love to shop. Have you been downtown yet? - No, we came right here. Pastor Zach didn’t wanna make any stops. All business, I’m telling you. - What can I say? - Yours, too. My husband practically lives at the church, but that doesn’t have to stop us girls from having any fun. Do you like shoes? - Um, love shoes. - Okay, girl, let me tell you, you’re about to find your new happy place because Wooded Plains may be small, but the shops here are amazing. - Isn’t it perfect? Didn’t I tell you? - It’s a dream. I mean, a beautiful home, peace, quiet, a huge yard for Alex to run around and play, nothing could go wrong in a place like this. - How about a tour? - Okay, now is that your house? - Oh, no, we live down this street here. - Oh, well, then who lives there? A potential babysitter? - Probably not, but we do have plenty of young eager babysitters at the church. - I don’t remember anyone coming or going when I was here. I thought it was vacant. Does he attend church? - No, he’s actually one of the few people in town who doesn’t. Pastor James and I, we’ve been over there several times, but he won’t answer the door. He’s a little strange, but he’s harmless. - I’ll stop by and invite him. I have a way with people. - Oh, well, I love your confidence. Maybe you’ll be the one to finally introduce him to God. - I hope so. - Wanna go inside? - Honey, there’s 14 jets in our tub, eight for your feet. It’s like a masseuse made out of water. - Hey, what are we gonna do about getting the neighbor into a service? - Well, I think the first thing you need to ask yourself is why is it so important to you? - Well, it’s important to me because I’m a pastor and it’s a pastor’s job to get people into church. - Oh, good, I was worried it was a macho ego thing to impress your boss. - No way, no, no, I’m just being a good Christian neighbor who likes a little job security. - Well, by all means, get him saved, Pastor. I want my grandbabies visiting me in this house. I got you a little housewarming gift, Pastor. - Uh, I though you were shoe shopping. - I’ll be right back. - I’ll be right here. - Zach, what is that? - It’s nothing, it’s nothing, just go get dressed. - Is that real? - Yes, of course, it’s real, but you don’t need to worry, it’s completely safe. - Obviously, it just fell out of a box. When did you get that? - I got it when we lived in the city. The South Side wasn’t exactly the safest neighborhood and it’s my job to protect you and Alex. - Okay, we’re not in South Side anymore. You’re a pastor, get rid of the gun. - I don’t know, we are not country people. I mean, what if we get attacked by a goat. A goat. - Or a deer. Or a squirrel or a dog. - Ha ha, get rid of the gun. - I will get rid of the gun if you get rid of those sweatpants. - Deal. - Deal. - Hello, anybody home? I guess he’s not here, sweetie. It’s okay, we’ll come back later. Oh, well, hey there, neighbor. My name is Amber, this is my son, Alex. We just moved in next door. - Hi. - I hope you like chocolate chip. As far as I know, everyone does, so I thought they’d be a good choice. Oh my goodness, do you have a nut allergy? I am so sorry, I should have brought fruit. - No, no, I’ll take them. - Oh, great, I hope you like them. - Why did you do this? - Well, we just moved in next door and thought it would be a nice way to get out and meet the neighbors. - Did your mommy make enough cookies for everyone on the street? - Nope, just enough for you, so you can come to our church and not go to hell. - Cute kid. Nothing like a gift with a motive to start a friendship. - That’s not... Alex, that’s not entirely true. Of course, we would love for you to come to church, but we also just want to get to know you, we’re neighbors. - So your husband’s the new pastor over there. - Yes, he is. - I don’t go to church. Pastors bring me down. - My husband will do anything but bring you down. God is good. - All the time. - Firing up 1,000 people for Jesus, changing the world, sitting in a hot tub with my hot wife. Was I right about this place? - It’s perfect, everything here is perfect. - I told you, I told you. You said, "No, no, no, we’re not living the city "to move to the country." And then you came here, and it’s perfect and it’s amazing. And I told you, and I preached a sermon about how good change is this morning. You should actually check it out. You can download ’cause I am officially on a podcast. - Careful there, Pastor Zach, pride comes before the fall. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This whole town is gonna know that Pastor Zach and his family have arrived! - Oh, be quiet. - And that’s my first project right next door. - He’s not a project, he’s a person. You get that, right? - You know what I mean. Hey, neighbor, I’m Zach Reynolds. Me and my family just moved next door. I though I’d come over and say hello. Have you lived in Wooded Plains long? Yes. Have you ever been to Life House? No. - You should come by sometime. It’s a great place. I’m actually about to start a sermon series based on my book. I don’t know if you’ve read it. It was called "Cutting the Fat." It’s about identifying the things in life we need to change. I think it’s really important. Never been there. - Okay, well, if you ever wanna drop by, the services are at 9:00 and 11:00, and let me know if you ever need anything. You can send your wife back over with some more cookies. - Yeah, she is an amazing chef. That’s why I married her. But it does make maintaining this waistline a little harder. But, yeah, I’ll tell her you enjoyed them. You’re gonna tell her to send me more, right? You said if I ever needed anything to let you know. Or was that an empty promise? - I’ll have her make another batch. You have a blessed day. Once a week, please. On Thursdays would be nice. And I would very much prefer for her to bring them alone in the future. Children make me uncomfortable. - I’ll see what I can do. It was a pleasure getting to know you, Pastor Zach Reynolds. I look forward to getting to know your family much better. - Hey, sweetie. I saw you talking to the neighbor. How’d it go? - Yeah, it was strange. Hey, listen, I don’t think it’s a good idea for you or Alex to go over there when I’m not around, okay? - What, why not? - He just seems a little off. It’s probably nothing. I just think it’s a good idea to keep our distance until we know him a little better. - Well, how am I supposed to get to know him any better if I keep my distance? - You know what I mean. - Okay, I love you, but you sound a little ridiculous right now. I mean, is he strange, yes, but he’s just lonely and needs some friends, and maybe that’s why God brought us into his life. - I know, you’re probably right, I just-- - We are called to be a light in this world, Pastor. If we avoid everyone who makes us a little uncomfortable, what are we going to illuminate? - No, you’re right, we will get to know him. Let’s just go it together initially, okay? - Okay, weirdo. - I love you. Hey--oh, and tell Alex that he... Oh my goodness, sweetie, are you okay? - Yeah, I’m fine. Is it broken? - No, it’s just sprained, thank God. - What happened? - Well, the brakes went out on the car. You almost hit a little kid. Miraculously, everyone’s okay. - Oh, thank goodness. Okay, well, come on, let’s get you home. - Actually, I was gonna get a ride back to church with Jim, if that’s all right with you? - Hey, I tried, I know, but this guy’s got preaching on his heart, and I don’t think an injury’s gonna slow him down. - Okay, I want you to call me if you feel any pain or nauseous or dizzy, and make sure he ices it, and don’t get home too late. - Okay, I won’t, I promise. - I’ll have him home for dinner. - You better. - I will, I will. - Oh, hey there, neighbor, you startled me. - Oh, I’m sorry, I was just coming over to return the plate. Thanks for the cookies, they were delicious. I ate every one of them. - Oh, well, thank you, I’m glad you enjoyed them. - Oh, I did, I even asked Pastor Zach to tell you to bake me some more. Did he tell you I said that? - He did not, but I would love to. - Oh, well, I guess Pastor Zach is a busy guy. That’s a beautiful hot tub. - I know, right? - Yeah. - We are so blessed to be in this place. God is good. - All the time, right? - Yeah. You know, if you ever wanna come hang out or take a dip in the hot tub, you’re more than welcome to. I mean, God didn’t bless us with this beautiful place so we can keep it all to ourselves. - Wow, really? - Absolutely. - Well, I guess it would be rude of me to turn down your invitation. I’ve got to say, I’ve never had a neighbor be so kind to me before. - You know what? I was actually just about to head in. - Oh, really? Well, that’s sad, I was kinda hoping to run a few questions by you. - About what? - About God. - I guess I could spare a few minutes. - Great. So Pastor Zach asked me to visit the church this Sunday, and now I’m feeling all this kind of turmoil inside. Part of me knows that Christians are rude and they’re cliquey and they’re judgmental people who only want to make me feel bad about myself. But then again, you two have been so gosh darn nice that I’m almost tempted to give it another shot, to see if this church is different. - It really is. You have to, just once. I mean, everyone’s just gonna love on you. You’ve never met such a great group of people. - All right, I’ll do it, for you. But if anyone tells me that I’m a horrible person or that I’m going to hell, I’m holding you personally responsible for my crushed spirit. - Deal. - Deal. You know, huh, it’s true what they say about a Christian’s eyes. - And what’s that? - Well, they say that when a person sees Jesus, the eyes become all bright and sparkly. Your eyes do that. That’s nice. You’re so beautiful. - That’s why I married her. - I thought you married her because she could bake. I married her for a lot of reasons. - I bet. Your lovely young bride asked me to join her in the hot tub. I hope you don’t mind. - Why would I mind? - Exactly. What happened to your hand? - I bumped it. Hey, honey, it’s been a long day, what’s for dinner? Um, I thought I’d make some chili. Does that sound good? - Mm, yummy. - The water’s great, pastor, come on in. - You know your way home. - Please don’t be angry. Why do you think I’m angry? I’m getting through to him. He wants to believe, sweetie, he’s just... He’s nervous, he feels like Christians are always judging him. - Well, maybe his actions warrant the fear. - Obviously, nothing happened. He just wanted to talk about God. - In the hot tub, while I’m at work? That’s not okay, Amber. - Okay, come on, seriously? What do you think happened? - I don’t know, but I told you this morning not to hang out with him, and I come home to this? What am I supposed to think? - Wait. - What? - Are you jealous? - No, no, I’m not jealous, I just want you to listen to me. - No, I think you’re a little jealous. Are you worried that I’m into the creepy hermit type? - Well, you were into me when I was a big fat guy, but you’re married now. No more pity crushes. - Pity crush? That was no pity crush. I fell in love with you because I saw the man inside underneath all of that. I didn’t care what you looked like. - Well, they say that love makes you blind as a bat. Maybe I should be worried. - I wouldn’t be worried. I’m blind as a bat and faithful as a penguin. You’re stuck with me, pastor. - Just don’t hang out with him when I’m not home, okay? - Okay. - Oh, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. I’m baking zucchini bread. I wanted to see if you and Alex wanted to join me? - Oh, hi, Evie, sorry, I’m just a little jumpy today. I thought you were... - The boogeyman? - No, it’s silly, it’s just Pastor Zach’s a little uncomfortable with the man next door and asked that I not let him come around when he’s at work. - Oh, that’s good advice for any married woman. But I hope he didn’t say anything in front of the neighbor. - Oh, no, of course not. It’s a non-issue, really. - Good, well, whatever it is, I hope it doesn’t distract him from being an extension of God’s love. After all, that is our true calling. - Hey, neighbor. How’s it going? Glad you made it. What’d you think of the service? - Interesting, a little showy perhaps. So you really believe that God can change people? - Absolutely, in fact, I think God is the only one who can. - See, I have a problem with that. If God has the power to change people, then why doesn’t he just do it instead of waiting around for us to destroy each other? - Pastor Zach, I’m so sorry to interrupt, but I’ve got Dr. Riley on the phone, and he has a terminally ill patient that’s requesting a visit from you this afternoon. He’s not expected to make it through the evening. - Oh, no. - Would you be a dear and be able to stop by? - Absolutely, yeah, I’ll be there. - You’re amazing. Dr. Riley, he’ll be... - Who is she? - Oh, that’s Britney, my assistant. I’m pretty sure I told you about her. - I don’t think you have. - Really, she’s great. Hey, so we should set up a meeting this week. - Yes, maybe we can meet at your house. Maybe Amber can cook us dinner. You’re an amazing cook, I bet. - I do know my way around the kitchen. I bet. - You know, I think my office might be more appropriate. Let’s do it there. - Okay, well, it’s a very busy week. I can meet on Tuesday. - Zach, hon, they’re losing him. We need you now. - Okay, set it up, I will be there. - I swear, Mr. Popular, right? It can be so hard to get him to do what I want sometimes. - That’s reassuring. - Guess what day it is. It’s a beautiful day. - It is a beautiful, wonderful, amazing day. I just got back from watching someone slip into eternity with full certainty of where they are going. It was amazing, it was peaceful, it was intoxicating. I love my job. Congratulations. - What’s wrong? Is it about dinner? I’m sorry that I missed dinner, but babe, if someone’s dying, I have to be there. No, I get it, your job is important, whatever. - Then what is it? - Tell me about Britney. - Britney? She’s my assistant. - Is she why you took the job? - I took the job to save souls, that’s it. Why would you even go there? - I don’t know, maybe because she’s blond and hot and into you. Babe, babe. I love you, you’re the only one for me. You have my heart, you have my soul forever. - Okay. - You don’t seem convinced. Do you want me to fire her? - Yes. Okay, babe, listen. - No, of course not. I love you. - Of course you do, I’m amazing. - And the most humble pastor in the history of Life House. - Do you know what, that might be true. And speaking of unparalleled amazingness, guess who got our neighbor to go to a meeting at church next Tuesday night? - Not you. - Yeah, no, it was me. - Tuesday night? - Yes. - Our anniversary? We have dinner reservations, I have a sitter lined up. - Hey, baby, I’m sorry, I can’t back out on this. It’s really important. He may never come back again. This might be my only chance to reach him. We can do it Wednesday. No, I have Wednesday evening service. Thursday, Thursday, I will take you out Thursday and we are gonna celebrate. - Bible study. - Okay, listen, I don’t know when we’re gonna do it, okay, but I promise we will and it’s gonna be amazing. We’re gonna celebrate. - Yeah, maybe next year. - Oh, look at that, it is your book. - Yeah, that’s it. It’s amazing how many lives are being touched by those words. I put my heart and my soul in this project. - Yeah, I read it. - Really, what’d you think? - Eh, I didn’t like it. It was too preachy for me. Not that I’m saying you’re a bad writer, it’s just I don’t like bad books. I did, however, find the parts about you and Amber intriguing, how she loved and supported you, even though you were fat and unappealing. It’s so hard to find a woman that cares so deeply regardless of a man’s size. - Well, I had some other things to offer, too. - Oh yeah, like what, rage? Because you were a pretty angry man back in the day before Jesus magically transformed you into a sweet and loving pastor. Do you still wrestle with it just once in a while? - You know what, I share some pretty personal things in the book, and I think it’s important because- - Because, because anger, anger is a tricky beast. You know, you can suppress it, you can cover it up, but it never really goes away. It just lies there dormant, waiting for another reason to explode. - Yeah, well, mine’s gone. God healed me, and I believe he can do the same for you. Who said I’m angry? - No one, but we’ve all got stuff. Do you know what I see when I look at you? - No, tell me. I see someone who’s hurting, someone’s who’s tried to the right thing and came up short. That’s what darkness does, it blinds us to the truth of who he really is and how much he does love us, even with our mistakes. He’s a loving and forgiving God and wants to be in relationship with you. Would you like to begin that journey? - So you met Amber in college. - Yeah, we were in a theology class together, and she was always asking these deep profound questions about God and life, and I wanted to be with her. I wanted to spend every day and hour with her. - Hmm, so the real reason you married her was for her spiritual depth. The baking and the beauty were just nice perks. - Pretty much. Speaking of spiritual depth, you asked an interesting question yesterday at church. - Do you still love her that way? - What? - Do you still long to be with her every second of the day? Because some men when they get married, they run off. They build a life for themselves, and they com-com-completely forget the treasure that they have at home. You’re not one of those guys, are you? - We both have our responsibilities, but don’t think for a second that means I don’t love her more every single day. Well, that’s good to hear, ’cause a woman like Amber deserves to be loved more than anything in the world. This guy’s a waste of my time, I’m moving on. I don’t think that’s an option for a pastor. - He doesn’t wanna talk about God, Amber. He wants to talk about you. - You’re asking him to open up about himself to you. That’s a big deal, it takes time. - I’m telling you-- - I don’t know what your problem is with this guy, but it ends now. You are a pastor. You’re supposed to be one person he can’t push away. Loving people is your job now. You know, maybe you need to spend a little bit less time writing your sermons, and a little bit more time listening to them. Did you know you can do that now? You’re on a podcast. - I’m headed out, I’ll see you later. - Bye. - Good morning, pastor. - Nice pjs. Don’t you wear those to work? - Oh, I don’t work. I’ve been unemployed for years. It’s a tough market. Fortunately for me, I came into a little inheritance when my Grandmamma passed away. I’d give it all up to have her back though. She raised me from the time I was seven years old. Did I ever tell you that? - No, and it sounds like a super interesting story, but unfortunately, I have to go, so-- - That’s really sweet. She sounds like a really special woman. - Oh, she was. She was into God, too, like you. She certainly would have approved of you. You too make such a perfect couple. I’m sorry I made you miss your anniversary dinner. - How did you know it was our anniversary? - She was really into gardening, too. I remember planting flowers with her. Those were happy times. - Hmm, well, I have to go, babe. See you tonight. - I’d better get back to it. - You have a real gift for gardening. Don’t move. I have something for you. - Those are beautiful. - Yeah, they’re mums. Mm. My favorite kind of flower. I think it would look beautiful right next to yours. Does Pastor Zach help you garden? - Oh, no, it’s not really his thing. He’s so busy with work and everything. - Yeah, I understand. My dad was the same way. Gone all the time, late nights at the office. Of course, it turned out he was having an affair with his secretary. But I’m sure Pastor Zach is not like that. You have nothing to worry about. We should have seen it coming. He showed us all the signs. He just became very mysterious and angry, always accusing mom of having an affair. Well, you know what they say, if you’re hung up on the idea of someone cheating, it’s probably because you are. - The fact of the matter is the board wants red, so it’s out of my control. Hey, can I call you back? - Hey, Amber? Oh, hey. - Hi. You, me, anniversary dinner, 10 minutes, go get dressed. - Hello, Pastor Zach. How do you like Amber’s garden? You know what, I didn’t even notice it. It looks beautiful. How do you like the mums? - They look great. - Thanks, we spent all afternoon together working on them. - Well, it looks great. Thanks. So you two look fancy. What’s the occasion? - You know, I think you already know. - Wow, really? You mean, I can’t believe it. I’ll get my tie, just-- - Whoa, whoa. It’s really weird that you would think it’s okay to invite yourself to our anniversary dinner. Besides, don’t you think you’re a little under dressed? Why don’t you plant some begonias in your own yard? Don’t wait up. That’s what darkness does, it blinds us to the truth of who he really is. How much he does love us even when we make mistakes. He’s a loving and forgiving God and wants to be in a relationship with you. Would you like to recognize him? - What time is it? - 6:30. - Why? - Good morning, Pastor Zach. Did I wake you? Oh, I’m sorry, I know you were out till 1:37 this morning, but you’re usually up by now. That is really weird that you know that, man. - Yeah, I wanted to apologize for yesterday. I hope I didn’t ruin your anniversary dinner by asking to come along. Nope, don’t worry about it. Just go back to bed, okay? - It’s just that yesterday was a... It was a special day for me, too. - Really? - Yeah. It was the 10-year anniversary of my Grandmamma’s passing. - Oh, I’m so sorry. - It’s okay, it’s okay, there’s no way that you two could have known, and I feel bad, and I wanna give you something. Listen, we can’t take anything from you. - Oh, no, please, I would want you to have it. Grandmamma would have loved the two of you, and she would want you to have this. I wanna do this for her. Will you be home this afternoon? - Well, we have church at seven, but yeah, we should be home most of the afternoon. - Good, good, all right, I’ll bring it over after lunch. Congratulations on your anniversary. That’s really special. Okay, well, I’m a jerk face. - I’ll go make coffee, jerk face. Hey, babe. How’s it going? - Oh, I just... Why did I ever start a sermon series on loving your neighbor? - Do you really want me to answer that? - Yes. - Maybe because you need it. It’s show time. - Hey, neighbor. Sorry it took so long, it was pretty dusty. I wanted to shine it up before I brought it over. I’ve been working on it all day. - Oh my goodness, it’s beautiful. - Yeah, yeah, it was Grandmamma’s. Her and Pops, they were married 62 years. You two remind me of them. Well, the hook is damaged, so it’s kind of difficult to hang, but I know how to do it. It shouldn’t take me more than a half hour. What do you think, Pastor Zach? - It’s beautiful, but we can’t take your grandmother’s mirror. - Oh, yes, you can, I want you to have it. - It is amazing, but we are actually just headed out the door. Could you come back after nine sometime? Well, it’s pretty heavy. - Why don’t you just leave it here, and I’ll put it up when I have some time? - Um, well, it’s difficult to hang. You have to know exactly what you’re doing or it could fall and break. - Okay, quick kidding around, Zach. We love the mirror, it’s beautiful. Listen, we’re on our way out, but would you be willing to hang it for us while we’re gone? - Of course. - That’s perfect, some on in, right, Zach? Alex, time to go. - Knock ’em dead, Pastor Zach. - Lock up when you leave. - Will do. Here it is. Oh my goodness, it’s amazing. - Great, so he was in here. - Oh, would you stop it? Look at this, is it not gorgeous? - It’s pretty. DeBrand’s Fine Chocolates? - Oh. - He’s not such a bad guy after all. Amber, now you can enjoy the beauty that the rest of us see in you. Not super thrilled about the note. - No way, honey, it’s a skinny mirror. I just lost 10 pounds, ha! Oh, mm, mm-hmm, I could get used to this. - Hey, good morning. - Hi. - Good to see you again. How did you enjoy your neighbor’s message this morning? - I enjoyed it very much. I like this series. I think it’s important to be a good neighbor. And thank you for inviting me here. You were right about these people. It feels so good to be a part of a church family. - Sure thing, buddy. Hey, do you mind if I grab a quick word with you real quick? - Sure. - Be right back. So, yeah, I wanted to talk to you about the mirror. First of all, thank you so much, it’s beautiful. I know it must have meant a lot to you. - Well, you and Amber mean a lot to me, too. Mostly Amber. - Yeah, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. The note, what was that? - Oh, I’m sorry, was there a typo? I’m a terrible speller. - Oh, I think you know what I mean. It’s inappropriate for you to be writing flirty notes to a married woman, yeah? - Oh, I see, but it’s okay for you to write flirty notes to a single woman. - What are you talking about? I see the way she looks at you. Clearly, your many late nights have not been lonely ones. - Don’t even go there, bro. Well, I can certainly understand the attraction, she’s very pretty, very, very. - All right, listen, you might not even get this coming from a jacked up family. - Oh, jacked up now, huh? - But Amber and I are in love. - Are you? - We’re in love in every way. - Really, really? - I will fight anyone-- - Oh, you wanna fight me? - Or anything that comes between, bf. - Well, don’t get so angry, Pastor Zach. I know how violent you can become. It’s not very neighborly. Oh my goodness. - Hi. - Thank you so much for the mirror, we love it. - Oh, wow, really, thank you, it feels so good to hear. - Get away from him, get away! You’re done, you’re done! Don’t touch my wife, don’t touch me, don’t come to my house, and don’t come back to church. - What is your problem? - I’m sorry, Pastor Zach, I forgot that the house of God is no place for sinners. - Are you okay? - The back of my head is kinda hurting. - I’m trying to protect you, you have to understand that. - You’re the only one who has a problem with him, Zach. - Maybe I shouldn’t be. Doesn’t he ever give up? - Great, he probably wants his mirror back. - Evie, where’s James? - He’s in his shop. I bet he’d love some company. Here you go. So Zach has been very angry lately. I mean, the man brings us a gift, and the next day he kicks him out of church. - Thank you. - He’s reminding me of old Zach, and it scares me. Why is he so upset? - He has this irrational fear that there’s something going on between us. - Is it irrational? - Yes, obviously, I mean, maybe the guy has a little crush on me, but I’m not attracted to him at all. I just wanna be a good neighbor. - So you’re not enjoying how this crush might be making Pastor Zach a little jealous? - No! I don’t know, maybe. Zach is always a superstar. I mean, everyone loves Pastor Zach, which they should, he’s an amazing man, when he’s not acting like a crazy person. And where am I? In his shadow, always, and nobody even knows who I am. - That is not true. - It feels true. So I guess it was nice to be noticed for once, and I’ve never seen Zach jealous ever. It made me feel wanted. - Amber, be careful about using jealousy to gain the attention of your husband. It only backfires. Look, I get it, as women it makes us feel like our husbands are fighting for us, but really it just pushes them away, and sometimes into the arms of someone who they might find more trustworthy. - Okay, why do I feel like I’m supposed to be reading into that? - How well do you know Pastor Zach’s assistant, Britney? We recently found out that he’s been sending her little gifts and notes on occasion. - What kinds of gifts? Flowers, chocolates. We did have a conversation with her, and she said it hadn’t gone any further than that. James is gonna have a talk with Zach. - What did the note say? - It’s not important. - Oh, but it is important. Are we talking, thanks for doing a great job, or thanks for being so pretty? - Amber, guard your heart and your family. You’re on the front lines and you’re doing important work for the kingdom, and sometimes that puts you in way of attack. All this, it’s just a distraction. - Amber. I just need my tablet. - Okay, um, okay. It’s a beautiful bouquet. - Amber, I... - We have a son, Alex. You know that. He’s seven, he’ll be eight in January. - Alex is a very sweet boy. - Yeah, like his daddy. He needs his daddy, and I need his daddy. You’re beautiful. There’s gonna be a single man out there who’s very lucky to be with you. Please don’t ruin my marriage. - I won’t. We never did anything. He sent some gifts, but it never went anywhere, I swear. He’s actually not flirty around me at all. He’s all business. It’s actually very confusing. - Thank you. - Hi, Evie. Yeah, we spoke briefly. Sorry, yeah, I shouldn’t have done that. I just needed to know. No, I understand, I appreciate your friendship. Alex, come on inside, time for lunch. Alex! What, oh, I’m sorry, I just... I don’t see Alex. He was just here. - Hey, how’s it going. - Here you go. - Thank you so much. - Would you like cream or sugar with that? - Oh, no, I’m fine, thank you though. - Have a great day! - You, too. - Hey there, young man. - Hey. Oh, hey, dude. - Yeah. - Can you help me out? - What can I do for you? - Cool, I gotta deliver these flowers to some chick named Britney. I was wondering if you knew where she was. - I can take ’em. - Great. - Thanks, bro. - Yeah, you bet. - What can I do for you, boss? - Hey, man, so I totaled my car a few days ago, and it was dragged here. I was wondering if I could have a quick look at it. - Any particular reason? - Yeah, my brakes went out and I guess in all the confusion I didn’t really get a chance to look and see if... You think somebody snipped ’em, don’t you? - Am I that obvious? - I get people in here every now and then thinking someone’s trying to knock ’em off, but I gotta tell you, brother, it doesn’t happen, unless of course, you know, you’re fooling around with somebody’s wife. - This was a bad idea, but thank you very much. - Dude, it’s cool, it’s right out back. If you wanna look at it, we’ll go look at it. - All right, let’s do it. - Are you cool with that? All right, cool. - Thanks, man. - Sprinkling Can, where we grow memories. This is Katie, how may I brighten your day? - Yeah, hey there, this is Pastor James with Life House Church. How are you doing? - Oh hi, Pastor James, how are you? - Good, good. Hey, I have a favor to ask of you. - Yeah, absolutely, I’ll do what I can. - Yeah, we have a staff member, Britney, who’s been getting some deliveries from a coworker, and we’re gonna need that to stop. Could you please refuse any future orders from Zach Reynolds? - Wait, so there really is a Zach Reynolds? - Yeah, yeah, he’s the guy that’s been ordering the flowers? Zach Reynolds, 1010 Pleasant Oak Street. - No, they’re being sent from a Zach Reynolds, but that is not the name on the credit card, and I don’t think that’s even the right address here. Let me take a look. Yeah, it’s being sent from 1006 Pleasant Oak Street, which is probably next door. Do you want me to go ahead and put a block on it? Hello? - Yes, yeah, please, thank you. - Step one, locate the brake line. Usually, it’ll be right up under here. Oh, that’s different, okay. What? Hey, Evie. Amber? No, no, I haven’t seen her. What’s wrong? - Well, it’s probably nothing, but I was just talking to Amber about 10 minutes ago, and she said she couldn’t find Alex. She said she’d call me back when she found him, but I still haven’t heard from her. I just tried calling her back and she didn’t answer. Have you heard anything? - What, no! - Hey, boss, might you have yourself an enemy? - No, why? - Well, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but this thing’s cut clean. - Evie, I gotta go. Thank you for this. - You better stop messing around with those married women. There’s a lot of crazy dudes out there. Wow. - Alex, Alex! Hello! Hello, is anybody... Alex? Alex? Alex? Alex? Alex? - I was hoping you’d come. - I’m looking for Alex. - Oh, I wish you hadn’t seen that. But you won’t tell anyone, will you? It will be our little secret. - I won’t. Have you seen Alex? - Do you wanna watch? I caught some great moments of you and Pastor Zach. You can learn a lot about someone by watching them when they don’t know it. Pastor Zach speaks very differently of me when I’m not there. I don’t think he likes me very much. But not you. You stand up for me. Mm, I like that. - Alex! - 14 minutes and 37 seconds. - Alex, we need to go home right now. - But mom, we’re watching a movie. Can we stay, please? - It’s important to always know where Alex is. They say it takes as little as six minutes alone with a stranger for a child to be abused. - Alex, come up the stairs now! - You know where I heard that? The news. You know how I know it’s true? Because they were talking about me. Isn’t that funny? - Alex, let’s go. - Just a minute. - Now! - Six minutes away from my mother, I was six years old at the time. Six days away from my seventh birthday. Six, six, six. I always figured that’s why they called it the devil’s number. I don’t like talking about it much, but I feel so close to you, like I can tell you anything, and you’ll still love me. Bye, Alex. Come back soon. - I don’t want you to ever go over to a stranger’s house without me again, do you understand? - He’s not a stranger. - Don’t go to anyone’s house without me. - Why? - Come here. I want you to lock this door and don’t open it for anyone, including me, okay? - But why? - I love you. Who is it? Who’s there? Hello? - Hi, Amber! I’m sorry I startled you. Please open the door, we need to talk. - My husband’s on his way home from work. He’ll be here any minute. You need to go. - I just really need to talk to you. - You really need to go home now. - Mommy? - It’s okay, Alex! - I know you keep an extra key in the kitchen, so I made a copy while you were out. I hope you don’t mind. - Please leave us alone. - Okay, but you know, Amber, you don’t have to worry. I would never hurt you, I just wanna talk. - I don’t feel like talking, please go now. - Okay, but we’re still friends, right? I hope this doesn’t make things awkward between us. - Sure, yes, of course. - Okay, okay, good, good. I’ll leave, I’ll leave, okay. Oh, I did, I brought you something. It’s right... - Yes, I’d love to come in, thank you. - Come on, come on. Thanks for calling the Reynolds. Please leave a message. Amber, Amber, please, if you’re there, pick up now. - Sorry, Pastor Zach, she’s unavailable. - Amber, I need you to pick up the phone right now. Okay, Amber, I’m gonna be there in five minutes. I’ll be right there. - Thanks for the tip. Don’t wait up. Hey, I gotta a crazy idea, you wanna get married? We can do it in the old city church where Grandmamma and Pops got married. They would like that very much. You want to? Yeah, me, too. - Amber, Alex, Amber! Amber, Alex! - Daddy? - Yes. Oh, thank God, you’re okay. Where is mommy? - He took her to the old church. - Who took her? - The man next door. - Okay, come on, come on, come on. - Alex, you had us a little worried. Where’s Amber? - I’m going to pick her up right now. If you could just watch Alex-- - Yeah, sure. - That would just be great. - You know what, it’s a little cold out here, how about we go get some hot chocolate, okay? - Isn’t this beautiful? Come on, there’s more. Grandmamma used to bring me every Sunday. This was my classroom. I liked the stories of Jesus. They said he loved me, but his people didn’t. They said I was strange, everyone except for Miss Hanson, my Sunday School teacher. She was nice, like you. Then she got married, she moved away. I didn’t wanna come back here anymore. They used to chase me down these hallways. I can still... I can still hear them laughing at me. I don’t know why they didn’t like me. I guess I just didn’t fit in. Oh yeah, imagine what people would think if they saw me here with you. They’d be so jealous! Ready, you ready? Come on, it’s okay, don’t worry. It’s okay, it’s okay. You don’t have to be scared. - Let her go! Amber, are you okay, has he hurt you? - She doesn’t wanna be with you. She doesn’t wanna be with you anymore ’cause she doesn’t like mean people. We’re gonna be happy together. We’re gonna have a happy life. Go ahead, tell him. Tell him. You don’t wanna be with me? Then nobody does. You win, Pastor Zach. You always win. Go ahead, I’d do it if the tables were turned. There’s no witnesses. No one will even know I’m gone. - I’m not gonna shoot you. - Oh, come on, drop the pastor act. We both know who you really are. - No, you know who I was. That’s not me anymore. God changed me, he can change you, too. - You wanna change me so badly, you don’t even know who I am. - Of course, I do. - Really? What’s my name? - I don’t think you ever told me. - You never asked. Nobody ever asks. You didn’t care about me. I wasn’t a person, I was just a project, just another notch on your pulpit. - I’m not perfect, you’re right, but that doesn’t mean that God doesn’t love you perfectly. He knows your name and he loves you. - No, he doesn’t. - He does love you. I know it doesn’t always feel like he does, but it’s true. - No, he doesn’t. - Zach. - It’s okay. No, no, no. He wants to be in a relationship with you. - No, nobody does. - Run! - Hey, are we getting married today or what? Pastor Zach is out of the picture. There’s nothing holding us back now. - What did you do to Zach? What did you do to him? Zach? Zach? - Wake up, dear friend, come on, please. - Do you think God is mad at me? - No, come on, come on. No, no, no, hey, come on, just breathe. Keep breathing, come on, keep breathing. Rob Thompson is gone. This is where I’m supposed to celebrate or feel some sense of relief, but I don’t. I was right about him, but he was right about me, too. I didn’t care about him. I thought I did, but I didn’t, not really. He was a project to me. Everyone always has been to some degree. Do I even know how to love someone for real, like Jesus? Or has my whole life been a show? - You can’t keep beating yourself up forever over this. Don’t go. Let us love you and Amber back to restoration. - No, I can’t. How can I teach? How can I tell them to love their neighbors after what I did? - What happened that night was not your fault. You didn’t have a choice, Zach. - No, but I made a lot of choices that led up to that. I didn’t love my neighbor. I’m not a good person, not good enough to preach. - Neither am I, none of us are, you get that? I mean, we’re all in need of God’s grace. - I’m the pastor, I’m not supposed to need his grace. - You’re not getting into heaven without it, brother. - Take it easy, pastor. Break time. - What’s up, brother? My name’s Jonas. - Zach. - What you got there, Zach, baloney? Man, I haven’t had a baloney sandwich in years. You know, I been watching you, brother. You’re the hardest working dude in this place, but I never see you smile or talk to anybody. What’s your story? - I don’t really have one. - I doubt that, we all got a story. You know what I see when I look at you? - No. - I see someone who’s hurting, someone who’s tried to do the right thing with their life, but for some reason, you just keep coming up short. You know, maybe you’ve missed the mark and now you feel hopeless and lost, like God couldn’t possibly love you anymore. Yeah, I’ve felt that way, too. But you know, God doesn’t love like we do. He doesn’t disown us, he doesn’t cheat on us, he doesn’t divorce us when we let him down. His love is greater than that. - No, you don’t know me. You don’t know what I’ve done. God couldn’t use me. - Zach, I’m looking at me and I’m looking at you. I bet my peanut butter sandwich against your baloney that I’ve done a lot worse, and he uses me every day. You don’t have to be perfect to be loved by God and to serve him. You just have to be willing and obedient. - Why are you telling me this? - Because you’re my neighbor, and God’s real big on his kids reaching out to our neighbors. You just got the call back brother. The question is, what are you gonna do about it?
