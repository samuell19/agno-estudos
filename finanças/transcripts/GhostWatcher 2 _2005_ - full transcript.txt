[ratcheting] [bones cracking] [flesh tearing] [metal clanks] Mom, you've looked at that thing 20 times since this afternoon. I still look the same. Watch your speed. I'm fine. Don't worry about it. Tracy! [crash] [horn honking] [honking stops] Mom. Mom. Are you okay? The seatbelt's jammed, Mom. Go. No! No, just help me. Come on! Tracy, go. [creaking] [glass shatters] There's been an accident. Help me. [Tracy yelps] [woman] How do we define tragedy? Anyone? Death? That's one way. The loss of a loved one. Yes, but they're very specific examples. I'm talking about the term itself. - An unhappy ending. - Very close. Tragedy is what happens when things don't work out the way we want them to. We want the happy ending. We want the villain to be vanquished and the hero to be triumphant and have everything tied up so we can feel better about ourselves. But if everything had a happy ending, if nothing unpleasant ever happened, how could we ever appreciate anything? Dad? I'm home! Sheryl. I got it. Awesome. But what if he finds out it's missing? He won't. Are you sure you can still sneak out this weekend? Hmm. Not a prob. My brother said he would cover for me. Okay. Oh, my dad's coming. I got to go. Call me later. ♪♪ [rock] [knocking] [thunder] Who is it? [woman] Help me. Hello? There's been an accident. Help me. What happened? There's an accident. I need help. I'll call the police for you.

Dr. Cross, report to oncology. How are you? I'm all right. What happened? I don't remember. I just passed out. Were you feeling sick? I said I don't remember. It's no big deal. It's a big deal to me, Trace. I got dizzy and passed out. That's it. You don't have to make a fucking federal case out of it. Do you have to talk that way? I'm just worried about you, that's all. Well, I said I'm all right. Okay, okay. Let's just go home. Get dressed. I'll be in the hall. [Sheryl] How could you lose them? I didn't lose them. They fell out of my pocket, and he saw it. What was I supposed to do? Oh, I don't know. How about lie? I'm going to be under house arrest as it is. Where'd you go last night anyway? I tried calling you back, but nobody answered. I fell asleep. [class bell ringing] [girl whispers] Tracy. [voices whispering] [jet engine revving] [whispering continues] [revving continues] [screaming] [whispering continues] [man] Try to hold them open for me. Have you had any dizzy spells apart from these episodes? No. Nausea, vomiting? Uh-uh. I heard something. What was that? I heard something... right before it happened. I heard it the first time too. You said you didn't remember anything about the first time. I lied. Hold on, hold on. What did you hear? Voices. Lots of them. What were they saying? I don't know. I could make out a few words, but mostly they were just screaming. But there was something new this time though. Something overlapping. It sounded like... like an engine revving up. Like when the car's in park and you step on the gas. That's when the screams started. Billy? I'm ready now. Billy, I can't wait any longer. Billy. [screaming] - [evil laughter] - [screaming] [growls] - [girl] Did you know there's a killer on the loose? - Killer? Yeah. They call him the Scraggler. He kills people who have sex. Whoa. Tracy? If you want to talk about anything, I'm here, okay? Uh-huh. Maybe you can talk to Melanie. [sighs] No. She's your sister, Tracy. Maybe she can help. I don't want to talk to her. Look, I just want to be able to talk to someone if you have a problem. Like what? Like anything. You mean like the problem I had after Mom died? Is that what you think this is? The doctors couldn't find anything wrong with you. If this is some sort of bid to get attention-- You think I'm making this up? I wish Mom was here.

Well, it was kind of weird, Trace, just wiggin' out like that right in the middle of class. Maybe it has something to do with the accident. - I mean, nobody really knows what happened-- - Don't. No, I just mean that for a couple of minutes-- Don't. All right. I'm sorry. [knocking] Yes? [Father] It's time for Sheryl to go home. One minute. What are you going to do if it happens again? Maybe it won't. See you tomorrow? Maybe the world will end, and I won't have to worry about it. [woman] Okay. Looks good. There you go. You're getting it. It isn't the easiest thing in the world to do. You're doing good. Just take small steps. Hi, Dad. [Doctor] The good news is, the tests came back negative. Have you had any more episodes? No. I'll prescribe a mild sedative just in case. Thank you. Howard, I have a few papers for you to sign. Do you mind waiting in the hall, Tracy? Barring a psychiatrist, which I know you've already tried, there is another avenue you might want to explore. It's rather unorthodox, but it might be worth the peace of mind. Recently, my sister bought an old Victorian house. A few months after she moved in, she started losing sleep because she was hearing voices. She hired a woman to come in and check things out. After a couple visits, the voices stopped. Apparently, she's helped out lots of people with problems similar to Tracy's. I know how it sounds. I know what you're thinking because I thought the same thing, but it really worked. Just might be something to consider. Of course, you didn't hear that from me. Glen? Hi. I'm Laura Kove. So how does this work? I'll talk to her, get her story, and if I think it's worth continuing, then we'll talk again. I have to admit, Miss Kove, no offense, but I don't really believe in this sort of thing. The only reason I contacted you is because I've tried everything else. Mr. Cain, in the three years that we've been doing this, we've come across a lot of different types of hauntings. No two are ever the same. I can tell you that none of this ever seems real until it happens to you. If it makes you feel any better, I didn't believe any of this either until I started working with Laura. I've seen things, enough to make me believe. Her room's upstairs? ♪♪ [stereo: hard rock] [knocking] ♪♪ [continues, loud] [volume decreases] Sorry. I was trying to get your attention. Your dad thought we should talk. I know this is hard, but I understand what you're going through. You don't have any idea what I've been going through. Maybe you can tell me. What are you, a shrink? No, but I have a lot of experience with things that are unexplained, like the voices you've been hearing. I don't hear them anymore. You're wasting your time. [volume increases] Trace, I really think you should give Miss Kove a chance. We've tried everything else. Dad? We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? Are you all right? Just a little indigestion.

Look, I know I haven't been around much lately, and I'm sorry, but that's going to change. What's that supposed to mean? I'm going to be staying with you for a while. And I hear you've been having some... problems. I'm going up to the casket. It isn't the easiest thing in the world to do. You're doing good. Just take small steps. Hi, Dad. - Well, she's all yours. - Thanks. Nice having you, Ellen. Let's go, Dad. - [radio static] - [voices chatting] - Hey. - [gasps] - Jesus Christ. Are you trying to kill me? - Sorry. It's Dad's shortwave. This thing used to scare me when I was a kid. All those voices and sounds... creep me out. What are you doing up? Couldn't sleep. Well, pull up some floor. I could use the help. Do you believe in ghosts? Ghosts? No. Why not? I don't know. Never really thought about it. If I told you I saw a ghost, would you believe me? No. I'd probably think you smoked something. Hey, what, are you serious? Forget it. Come on. Grab a box, and we'll do this downstairs. There's a mean draft up here. - What's in there? - I don't know.

You're not my mother. That's true. You made sure she's not around. What did you say? I said it's your fault that Mom's dead. Did you hear me? I heard you. You think it's easy putting up with your bullshit? You fucked up your life so now you're intent on fucking up mine too? I'm sorry to be such an inconvenience to you. Maybe it'd be easier for you if I were dead too. Don't delude yourself. This drama queen shit may have worked with Dad, but it's not going to fly with me. I am so sick of this poor little waif routine. "Nobody likes me. Nobody listens to me." - Shut up! - Look at yourself, Trace. Do you really wonder why you can't get a boyfriend or why nobody wants to be around you? - Shut up! - It's because you're worthless. It's because the only thing anybody feels for you is pity. You know the last thing Mom said to me before she died? She said she was sorry you were ever born. So this is your answer? - I'll do it. - Go ahead. I will! I swear to God! Heard you the first time.

Is that what this is? I don't know yet, but... what I do know is that there are some things with Tracy's case that are impossible to ignore. Look, I'm willing to give you some leeway here until we figure out what's going on. But if I think for one second you don't have her best interests in mind, I won't hesitate to pull the plug. Fair enough. Can you help her? I'm certainly going to try. I'm sorry. I know you've been through a lot, but I need you to tell me what you remember. One second I was on the road, and the next I was waking up in the hospital. Ever since then, I get this weird feeling sometimes, like someone's looking over my shoulder. This man, the one that stabbed you, you both died at exactly at the same moment. It's possible that when you came back, he came back with you. That would explain why you feel like you're not alone. He was there the night that Dad died. He took something from him. Took something? He held his hand over Dad's chest, and I saw a light or something rise up into his hand. And tonight... I saw him kill Melanie. Wonderful. He wanted me to do it. He made her say things. You know, so I would-- Maybe he can't do it himself. Maybe he's not powerful enough yet. I'd like to try an experiment. When the voices come again, try and listen to what they're saying. No. It might be the key to deciphering this. Someone's trying to tell you something. We need to listen. Can I ask you something? Of course. Why are you helping me? I mean, going out of your way. It's a little hard to explain. Sorry. Not too long ago, a man killed my family and then he came after me. After he died, he came back as a ghost, and he could get at me whenever he wanted. We got rid of him, but the woman who tried to help me, Elizabeth Dean, she... She died, didn't she? My fear and the secrets I kept got some people hurt. My best friend moved away. I haven't spoken to her since. You're doing okay now. I do all right. I have my bad moments, but Glen's always here to help me. So, see? Some stories do have happy endings. Do you think this one will? I'm not writing it, but I hope so. Are you doing okay? I've just been feeling a little sick since last night. I'll be okay.

He's keeping her alive for some reason. What did you find? Well, I started with the cemeteries, thinking I'd have the most luck, but I couldn't find these less common names, so I went to the phonebook. And? 150 of the names on this list have local addresses. I personally visited 30 of them, and they're all very much alive. What? Some of them are pretty common like "Joe Smith." But I don't think there's too many people out there with a name like "Harvey Keck." There's only one, and he wasn't too happy about me questioning his existence.

Uh-uh. You're the ghost woman. I am Mystic Martha. Ask me question about the future, and I will tell all. I am Mystic Martha. Ask me a question about the future, and I will tell all. I am Mystic Martha. Ask me a question about the-- Holy shit, Melanie. What did you find? This book talks about energy transference. It's taking someone's energy when they die. Blake was sick. That's why he stabbed her. He thought he could take her energy and it would saved him. If she haven't hit him that night, he was going to die anyway. That's why he said she saved him. He can actually do it now. "He said"? You talked to him? - Well, he-- - Never mind. I don't want to know. - What else does it say? - Give me a minute. What happened?

"When a large group or grouping of people perish, "as in a massacre or a cataclysm, "an enormous amount of energy is emancipated from the dying souls. "One with the fortitude and stamina to receive such energy could cure ills and even stave off death." That's what he wants. If he could receive such an enormous amount of energy at one time, he could live again. Only now he can know about the accidents before they happen. He still needs something to sustain himself in the meantime. He's training her, feeding off her until the next accident happens. - If she lasts that long. - No. He needs her alive. That's why she heals so fast. He's been protecting her. I think if she died, there'd be nothing to tether him here. He would cease to exist. So how do we stop him? That man-- the one who was after you-- how did you stop him? We tricked him back into his own body so he'd be trapped. So let's find out where Blake is buried. That's the first thing I checked. Nobody ever claimed the body, so he was cremated. I need a drink. We'll think of something. [Laura's voice] Help me, Tracy. What did you say? I didn't say anything. I didn't mean for it to end it this way. Oh, my God. What's wrong? I think I know. You can't do this anymore. - Stop it. - I'm serious. - You got to give this up. - I can't. - Why? - 200 people, Glen. Are we supposed to sit back and let them die? We can't stop it anyway. If we can't stop it, then I'm dead too. Don't you get that? She heard my voice. Your name wasn't on the list, Laura. Besides, there's no way for us to predict when something's going to go wrong. We're not meant to know. So that's your solution: just sit back and do nothing. The only thing we can do is not be there when it happens. If we stay away from her, at least we'll live. Look, I know that sounds harsh, but it's the truth. We have a life together. How are we supposed to live when we knew something was going to happen and we didn't lift a finger to stop it? I'll live just fine knowing that you're safe. And then what happens to Tracy? I know you want to help her. I want to help her too. It's just... we never dealt with anything this dangerous before. I just want you to think about what you're doing. Where you going? Melanie's being released from the hospital today. What about the talk we had last night? What about it? I'll get my coat. How are you feeling? Like I was thrown into a washing machine on high spin cycle. But I'll survive. Something's not right. What'd you say? I said-- Oh, no. - We got to get out of here. - What? We got to get out of here right now. Tracy, what's the matter? - What's the matter with you? - This is it. This is where it happens. What's going to happen? Oh, shit. [woman screams] What's going on?

But at least your sister's here to keep you company. No! [screaming] I forgot what it felt like to be alive. You have a choice. You can stay with her and live, or you can die right now. You say that as if I'm no match for you. You're not. I'm whole again. There's one thing you're forgetting. What's that? Being a ghost was the only thing protecting you. From what? From me.
