(audience applauds) Now a gorgeous applause to Meli. (crowd cheering) Thanks, my principal. Ladies and gentleman, I am Mademoiselle Coco. (applause) I am tonight with you as your M.C. (applause) This John invited me and Tunahan to his place. A small party. So? Have a good time.. Remzi said you should come with us. That's funny. You're hilarious Arzum (sounds from the stage) So, you mean while I, wonderful I, sing like a nightingale on stage John turns around and invites you and that Tunahan bitch to a party? (audience cheering) Is that it? Two bitches who flirt around to get a free drink? (music from stage) Does that make sense? Why not? Different tastes, different colors.. Meli: Colors? Arzum: Besides.. Who are you fucking kidding? Go tell the John I'm not coming, see what happens. Don't worry, I'm coming. I'm in the mood for some Champagne. Please, convey my regrets to Mr. Remzi. For attaching two ugly bitches to my party No, no, no.. I think, it's a good idea. If I'm with two ugly bitches, I will look more attractive. (Arzum sarcastically discards) (club music fades out) (high-heel footsteps) (urinating) (baby cries) (mysterious music) (baby screams) (baby crying stops) (baby coughs) (baby cries) (baby crying intensifies) (footsteps) (baby stops crying) (baby gurgles) Shhhh.. (door closes) (music fades out) (door unlocks, baby cries) (light switch) (light switch, baby crying) Please, shhh. Stop it, stop it. What the hell is going on? I found it in the trash What do you mean in the trash? Some whore threw it in the trash. What whore? Its whore of a mother, who else girl? Unbelievable. Its little hands are freezing cold. She could've left it in a park or something, someone could have found it. I tried to take off, but then it was still crying, I couldn't bare it. Then what? What do you mean, then what? I rushed home before it turned into an icicle. What now? What the hell are we going to do with it? Play mothers and fathers? Oh, I don't know. It can stay for a while, we'll think of something later. Girlfriend, how do you turn this thing off? (door creaks) It will be all quiet, when you wipe its ass and feed it. Mama Oh Madame, please shut this thing up. Aww.. You're upset. Aww, you have made a stink. Has it? Should we look? Of course you should, you morons. It won't tell us by itself, will it now? Ew, that's gross, it shitted itself. I'm taking you back where I found you. No, please. Over my dead body Oh, it's a boy. Evgenia, go warm up some water. Let's clean his little bum. Make sure it's not too hot. You go warm up some milk. He must be starving. And bring my Raki as well. Poor thing.. So she threw you out on the street, hey? She must've had a reason. But she didn't know how sorry she will be. I didn't know how bad I would feel, when I gave away my little girl. I still miss her very much. Hey Madame, what are you saying to him? Oh nothing, I was asking about his mother. Where's the little one? Gone. What do you mean, gone? I left him on the street. In this cold? Are you nuts? You want to kill him. He's not in the cold anymore, someone took him away. Who? Some tranny. (baby giggles) Wow that was quick, he was starving. He's too young to drink milk. Get some proper baby food and diapers too. Ok, it's time to burp him now. What? (baby farts) Oh, look at the little man.. Our son is going to be a macho man. Hey Madame, how does it feel to be a granny? Cut the crap, burp your own kid. My own kid? It can't be mine, my hips are too narrow. (groans) He's your baby now. You saved his life. Sister, you're glowing with motherhood.. It's great, you're a mother now and I'm an aunt. We have to give him a name. (nostalgic music) You are the head of the family, you name him. You'll be called Deniz You've had a bad start too. Your mother regretted she had you. I pray you'll end up well. Just like my Deniz. (seagulls squawking) (music ends) Girlfriend, it's too bright out here. I'm not used to going out this early. Come on sister, move your ass, he's starving. Ok, ok. Make sure you buy the whole list. Yeah, yeah I will.. Stop nagging. Bye now. (birds chirping) (door closes) (keys rattling) (keys in lock) (cello music) (conversation cannot be heard) (cello music) (baby cries) (baby groaning) (baby coughs) "The number you dialled is currently unavailable, please try agai.." Remzi: You never go home this early. What's been going on the past few days? you have a lover? You are nuts. I know, I know that you like young pretty boys Well.. It's up to you.. You'll lose me, okay. It's that Tunahan bitch, right? The girl likes me. What can I do? I don't know what you can do, but I shall scratch your eyes out. I will never trade you. Could I smell another rose? You'd even smell shit, if there was money in it. (laughs) That hurt. How little you know me. (laughter) Meli quick, Deniz is dying. What's wrong girl? Deniz has got a very high fever. (ambulance sirens) Where's the baby doctor, the baby doctor.. My baby is dying. "EMERGENCY" Go to the second floor, turn left, second door on the left. (door opens) Lady, wake up. Where's the doctor? Where is the doctor? I'm the doctor. My baby is dying, he has a fever. Calm down While I examine him, you go and register. (baby groans) You stay with Deniz, I will do it. (door closes) Take his diapers off and lay him on his stomach. ''NAME: M'' (ambulance sirens) (scribbles) ''NAME: F'' Doctor, what are you doing? I'm checking his fever. Have you already checked? No, but.. Isn't there another way to check? "NAME: HUMAN" Doctor: Over 40 degrees.. How long has the child had a fever? Don't cover him. I don't know. Did you notice the child have any convulsions? Like an epilepsy fit? I really don't know. (sighs) He might have suffered a febrile convulsion. And if not it may happen in the near future. What's a febrile convulsion, doctor? High fever, can do some damage in the brain. Which can result in paralysis or another ailement, in other words, it's very dangerous. (sobs) Lord help us. (sniffles) What is your relationship to the child? I'm his aunt. (door opens) What's wrong with him doctor? Whose baby is this? Ours.. Yours? Where's his mother? We don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I found him in the trash can, he was freezing so I took him home, we're looking after him. Did you inform the police? No You should have. In this country children without parents are given to state institutions. Look doctor, I didn't know this. If I had known, I wouldn't have taken him. I swear, I wouldn't have. If we go to the cops, they'll beat us. (Evgenia whines and sobs) If you like, we leave him to you.. You give him to the cops. Has he had his vaccinations? We don't know. Wait a minute, I'll get you the medicine. If I write you a prescription, you'll just end up spending money you probably don't have. We're always given free samples. Wait for me. (Evgenia crying) Stop crying, girl. Take this and hide Deniz in it. Get the hell out of here before the bitch comes with the cops. Don't use the main door, use one of the back doors. Get in a taxi and go straight home. (suspense music) Come on, go. (sirens) (heavy breathing) Taxi. (taxi breaks) (exhales a deep breath) Take me to Galata baby. Step on it, I've got a patient waiting. There, you are. Here.. (plastic bag ruffling) Look, I thought it will be best that you keep the baby for now. But you have to keep him under constant observation. Thank you, doctor. I wrote the instructions on the medicine. You have to get the fever down. Soak a towel in vinegar and put it on his forehead and keep an eye on him at all times. It's possible he'll have convulsions. If this happens, bring him to the hospital at once. I won't report you to the police on one condition, you will be in contact with me at all times. And bring the baby to my private office on Friday at 10 A.M. You'll come on Friday, right? Promise? Promise. Look, if you do not come, this child may be harmed, and you will be legally responsible. (sniffles) (door unlocks) (lets out a deep breath) (sighs) Oh god, I'm dead.. (exhales) What? Have you been playing doctor with the clients? Johns have sure changed over the years. In my time, they used to drink Champagne from our shoes. At the most, they'd ask you to keep your garters and stockings on. What the hell are you talking about, Madame? I've just escaped hell.. (door opens) Meli: Where have you been? Mama You will never believe what we've just been through. They almost took Deniz away from us. What happened? Spit it out. Early in the morning, Deniz had a fever. Of course, he was out on the street, freezing. Meli and I brought him to the hospital. Oh , I was wondering where you came from. They told us, you have to go to the cops when you find a baby in the street. Obviously, it's not a stray kitten, is it? If you knew, why didn't you tell me in the first place? (baby moaning) Evgenia, put the kid to bed. If he's sick, he should be in bed. I'll do it. He's my son. The doctor said, he may have febrile convulsion. Febrile convulsion? Aylin: I wish I'd never done it. (sounds from the city) No use now. I'll get him back. It's been three days. How can you find him? I will find him, I know that. (sighs) But I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do after I find him. I don't have a penny. I haven't worked for months now. You find the kid. Don't worry about the money. How? I still haven't recovered from the birth, I can't work. (Evgenia sniggers) Hey sister, what's with this? What's with this? What do you think? Do you think it was easy to get out of that fucking hospital? We must bring this kid back where I found him, right now. No, no, that doctor, she's good. She didn't go to the cops. She gave us some medicine, and her card. We must take Deniz to her office on Friday. What? You went and found the doctor instead of sneaking out the back door? The back door was locked. I had to use the main corridor. We passed each other. She said, take a cloth soaked in vinegar, put it on his forehead to drop the temperature. I know, as a kid, my mom used to do that to me, when I had a fever. Sister, please. You can't bring him back. You'll have to kill me. Okay, I fucking will. Have you both gone insane? Are you trying to get me arrested? She didn't report us. I tell you, doctor is good. Like hell she is. I know her kind. She didn't turn us in because there was no cop on duty. One was coming on duty as I was leaving. Don't fucking tell me what happened. I'll worry more and have a heart attack, you know I have a heart condition. Oh my heart.. As soon as you left, she reported us, that's for sure. And now the cops are about to come through that door. Because I was stupid enough to put our address on the fucking registration form Oh my god The thing is I should have listened to you. You told me not to have the baby. Never mind. It's done now. I was hoping that the guy would marry me. I'm stupid. Who would marry a whore? I'm always fucking things up. I said never mind. Damn, I'm so stupid. That night, I decided to leave him and just go. But I couldn't. Then that tranny found him. I thought, I shouldn't follow. I should just forget my baby. Don't think about it. But I couldn't help myself. I was so confused, I lost her. But I know just about where she lives. I am gonna get my baby back. (sighs) If the tranny still has him, of course.. Meli: I don't know the weather is warmer. I will leave him where I found him, maybe that bitch of a mother will come and take him. What if she doesn't? No, no, how about this? I will leave him in a park. Maybe a nice family will take him, they will love him, and together they will go to a new, happy life. What's the point, Saint fucking Meli? Why bother? You can hand him over when the cops arrive, they can put him in a home. Oh, sure. And they will kindly ask, where the fuck did you steal this baby from, freak? And beat the shit out of me. It will hurt two times more, if you put that boy on the street. Oh shit Madame? Maybe you were the luckiest whore in town, never touched by the cops, or the bastards only beat the faggots, not the whores. Go fuck yourself. I'm going to bed. Sister, please, don't call her a whore. Christ, the whole fucking world knows she was the best in her time All the old codgers in Pera still drool about her. Ah, Despina, you should have seen her. Still, you don't have to remind her. Sure, sure. Ok honey, you protect your mom. I have to remember my place. After all, I'm just a tenant here. Sister, what kind of talk is that? You're not a tenant, you provide for us. She's not my real mama, anyways.. (drawer opens and closes) The other day, in that store, I felt so ashamed. What store? The classy baby store. Why? All the women were so different. I felt cheap. Sister, what's going to happen with Deniz? Oh girlfriend, I'm dead tired. He can stay for today. It's too late anyway. We can't leave a baby in a park in broad daylight, can we? I will prepare the vinegar. Sister We can't give Deniz to the cops. They can't take good care of him in the children's home. All those glue sniffing kids come from homes. You have a point. Let's think about it tomorrow. First we get my son's fever down. Give him his medicine, then you can sit and wait for the cops.. (Sniffles) (Cello music) (Light switch on) Are you peeping on the fiddler again? (screams) (Heavy breathing) What's the matter with you girl? You scared me Oh God, I was so scared. I didn't hear you come. (Laughter) (Deep breaths) What's going on? (Loud laughter) Why are you screaming? Your scaredy cat girl scared the shit out of me. (Continuous laughter) I've been nervous all day, (Cello music ends) and when sister came behind me, I got scared and screamed, then she got scared and screamed. You're nuts. Both of you. (Continuous laughter) (Sighs) (Sighs and laughs) (Exhales a deep breath and laughs) (Takes a deep breath) Cheating bastard. (Continuous laughter) Oh sister, I'm still shaking. All day, I was so scared. (Nervous Giggling) I thought everyone who passed in front of the house was a cop. (Nervous laughter) (Key in lock) (Nervous laughter) (Nervous Laughter) Oh my God. What? Cops? No, no, no A woman is about to bust her boyfriend with another woman in the street. There's going to be a cat fight. Don't be scared. The police wouldn't give a damn about a little baby. That doctor woman is exaggerating. Sister, she didn't say the cops will come to our house, you did. Well.. Did I know what I was saying? I was shit scared, first thing in the morning. (Shouting from outside) What kind of man are you? (Shouting from outside) Have you no shame? (Forced laughter) (Shouting from outside) Who the hell are you woman? (Exaggerated laughter) (Loud forced laughter) You laugh.. I'll see if you'll still be fucking laughing, if anything happens to that baby (Takes a deep breath) (Shouting from outside) I gave you everything. How could you do this to me? What the hell is going on? (shouting from outside) They've started to fight, don't look, the cops might have come. Don't worry, sister. The doctor will save Deniz. I hope so. I trust her. I feel I know her. Like shit you do. I'm sorry.. Don't worry, I will take Deniz to that doctor. Girl, I want to do a little shopping. I want to look like the other mothers. You didn't go to that store. All those women looked at me like I I was some cheap slut. Okay. Maybe I am, but they don't have to push it in my face, Do they? Sister.. That woman doctor, you know what she did to Deniz? What? She put a thermometer up his.. What are you on about? Put it up his.. Up his what? Up his bum. She said that's how you take babies' temperatures. So? What if Deniz turns out like, us? What, you're really going mad, girl. If they stick thermometers into baby boys asses, then all the men would be gay. Think of what the world would be like, if all men were gay. Heaven on earth. (chuckles) You can make fun of me. If my father hadn't taken off with that woman to Beirut, I wouldn't have ended up like a girl. What woman? He had a fling with a revue girl who came to work in Istanbul. He went with her when she moved on. If he had been around, mama couldn't have raised me as a girl. Why did she raise you as a girl? Men are not loyal, she used to say, they always leave. Because my father did, I guess. Girls are loyal to their mothers, she said, they look after them. My real name was Evgeny. She changed it to Evgenia. She's right you know, men are disloyal bastards. When I was young, I thought I was a girl. We were lifting up our skirts to take a pee, and that was it. The girls never played with me again. You should have played with the boys, that would have been more fun Forget about it. Oh come on, don't be sad. I think it's God's work you are gay. Neither your mother, nor a thermometer up your ass can make you gay. It's our genes. But Madame wasn't very thoughtful, though. I'm not talking about Madame. My real mother, I told you. Madame: Evgenia love, can you fetch me my water jug from the kitchen? I will mama. Madame: Better still, just bring me a glass of water. Sure, mama. But, she really has been a mother to me, more than my own mother. The doctor will see you now. (Door closes) Hello. Hello, doctor. Please lay him there. Sh, sh, sh, sh You've changed a lot. That's how I dress for work. I never realised my clothes looked so strange to other people, until I found the baby. What do you do? I sing at Madame Margot, a night club. Madame Margot? It's in Suadiye. Why don't you come one night? be my guest. So, how's the boy with my name? Your name? (Door handle) Deniz.. Can you come to my office when you're done with your patient, please? Sure. Evgenia has your card. She only gave me the address. I didn't know your name. Is Evgenia a relative? No. I'm his mother's tenant. But we have become like family. I think he loves the baby more than you do. You were ready to hand him to the police at the hospital. I didn't want to get into trouble because of him. I didn't want him to end up in the street. Evgenia keeps telling me that if we turn him over to the cops, he'll grow up to be like those glue sniffer kids. You can dress him. I still don't know your name? Meli. What an interesting name? It's not my real name. When I first started, the girls in the club said singers should have a stage name and named me Mehtap. But Madame, my land lady I mean, didn't like it. She said: what kind of name is Mehtap? Sounds like a cheap belly dancers name. So she named me Melancholy. How romantic. But, because it's long, everyone calls me Meli for short. Listen Meli You have to be really careful. You remember what I said when we first met? Sure doctor, we're really careful. Bring him to me once a week. See you next week, then. Doctor? How much do I owe you? You don't owe me. I would also like to contribute to Deniz's future. Thank you. Who was that for god's sake? A transvestite. What, he had a child? (Giggles) No, he found him in the street. Found him in the street? Deniz, have you gone mad? You talk like it's a piece of discarded furniture that you can just pick up and take home. Some people are treated like that in this world. Street furniture. Left in the street to live without any purpose or hope. Some woman left her baby in the street and he found the baby. The baby had high fever. So, he and another homosexual friend brought him to the hospital. I fear a febrile convulsion may or may have occured. So, I offered to help. Did you notify the police? I thought of calling them, but then I didn't. Why? I knew what would happen next. They would send the baby to a state home, then a couple of underpaid, undereducated childcare workers would not be able to cope with him and the other 100 kids in their care. Worse than that, when he's 11, they will treansfer him to a youth home Where he'll meet torture, sex abuse, drugs.. Deniz. This is so irresponsible. You are a doctor. Just a moment, I hope you didn't call me here to lecture me, because I have a lot of patients out there waiting. When I came to your office, I didn't know you were an accomplice to a transvestite. Suzan, will you please cut it short. Okay. I just spoke to Mother on the phone. She told me Uncle was in Istanbul recently. When I told her I didn't know, she was very suprised. Did you know? Yes.. Dad paid me a short visit. Why wasn't I informed? Did he not want to see me? I don't know. He was here for some business and happened to pass by the hospital and dropped in briefly. We talked a little, then he had to leave, that's all. What did you talk about? Why didn't you even mention it? It wasn't anything important, Suzan. I forgot to tell you. Now with your permission, I have patients to attend to. Meli: We just don't know what love is. Why don't we? I don't know. Maybe because no one has ever loved us since we were born. Come on, mothers and fathers always love their children. Yeah, right, sure. My father loved me when he threw me out of the house, when I was seven. Why would he do that? Because his best friend raped me. He said he couldn't look at me without thinking about it. He couldn't live with the shame. What did your Mom do? What could she do? She agreed with him as always. God, it's stupid. Stupid? Stupid is not the word, it's selfish. Why should she give up her peace and quiet? If I had stayed, he would have remembered the incident every time he saw me. Then he would get angry and take it out on her. Mothers don't love their children. They just bear them to satisfy their own selfish insticts. Put the kid in his bed. It's late. Madame is upset. She's realised how selfish she was to raise you like a girl. Come on sister, I told you, she's not my real Mama. Like shit you did, you told me nothing. You just keep saying she's not your mother. I can't ask the details not to upset you, but I am dying of curiosity. Will you just fucking tell me and get it over with? (sighs) But, you will never tell Mama. I won't, go on. My Mama and Madame Despina were really close friends. She used to always come over and comfort Mom. Why would she comfort her? After my Dad took off, Mama was in mourning. She used to cry every day. Poor thing, that's the dark side of love. That's what Mama Despina used to say. She would say: good for nothing bum, took all your money and now with this hopeless love, he's taking all your beauty away. Was your Mom a whore, too? I don't know, no man ever entered the apartment but, I don't think she was an angel. Otherwise, where could she get money to buy this apartment? How could Dad take her money? True. She didn't have any relatives that I knew, only Mama Despina. I think she was providing for us at the time. Sometimes, she used to come with this little girl, she had green eyes, fair hair, she was nice. We used to play. Then, she disappeared one day. What happened to your real Mom? One day, there was a lot of joy. Mom found out where Dad was. He had opened a bar in Beirut. She said: we are going. She put the house up for sale. Mama Despina said: don't be crazy, you will ruin the childs life. She's right. Then? Then, Mama Despina bought the house from my Mom and she wouldn't let me go, she took care of me and looked after me, but she never told me she bought the house. but she never told me she bought the house. She always says: this is your house. And your Mom? She went to Beirut. That's why I think Mama Despina bought the house. Otherwise, where would mum have found the money to pick up and go? Haven't you heard from her? Yes, she sent a letter. She had found my Dad. She said they were happy. She said they would come and get me soon. Then, no more letters, no more news and a war started in Beirut. Maybe she died. See? Another example of selfishness. Mothers don't have the right to die. If your'e going to die, why have children? (sighs) Where did this tranny disappear to? You can't find those people during the day. They work at night, and sleep all day. We have to look for him at night or very early in the morning. Of course. Yeah. Stupid me. How couldn't I think of this? It was 4 in the morning, when she found my baby. Aylin: She was going back home from work. (dance music playing from club) You're leaving early again. (cries out) It's you Remzi. You scared the hell out of me. What's up? Where are you going? I feel a little sick, I told the boss I.. You are sick, hey? Who are you kidding? You have found someone new, haven't you? Don't start with this bullshit again, Remzi. Look, Remzi, I'll be frank. I have to change my life. Now.. Remzi: Now what? Look.. The last few months, I have a completely different kind of love in my life. What do you think I am? A schmuck? Please don't get nasty. You've got me wrong. You get me wrong, baby. I won't let someone else take your money, okay? Damn you. It's just the money hey? At least don't say it to my face, you bastard. (Screams) Don't hit me. (Screams and Slapping) (running foot steps) (crying) (key in door) I found the tranny. Great. Does he still have the baby? (hard slap on the back) Come here. Sit down. Listen loser. I told you I'm in a hurry to finish with this joint, so I won't waste time with you as well, you hear? How will she go on stage like this? I'm sorry, boss. She hit me you see, I lost control. Hear me out, faggot. I don't go around hitting people, like you do. If you catch my drift? Believe me, boss, I'm really sorry, I really regret it. Please forgive me darling. (sobbing) Believe me, I really regret it so much. I couldn't sleep at all last night. Perverts, the bunch of them. Mama, are you taking another trip through nostalgia? The sun of reminiscence never sets, Evgenia, I can now see that I have lived such a mad,sad, but just as happy life. Don't upset yourself, you don't want another heart attack. Life has no meaning without the sorrow of the past that will never return. You're also drinking too much mama. Well, the doctor says it's good for me. It opens the veins. I will go and wake Meli up. We'll take Deniz to the park. Pick me up a bottle of Raki on your way back. (door opens) Sister, I forgot my sunglasses, go get them. (door opens) The bitch has really settled in now. (door opens) (birds singing) Don't look, girl. What do you see in that fiddler? I never know. It's not a fiddle sister, it's a cello or something. Cello, schmello They're all fiddles anyways. Oh come on, sister. Give me a break. (children laughing) Look at that woman sitting alone over there. I think she is watching us. So what? everybody stares at us. No, this one's watching us differently. Look carefully. No, look, she's going anyway. She kept looking at Deniz. She will give him the evil eye. (knocks on wooden bench) (children playing) Oh shit, Mama's Raki Girl, that's the woman in the park, she's following us. Come on sister, what the hell? (suspense music) Come on, girl. (suspense music ends) (mischievous music) Fuck the stupid woman, let's go get Madame's Raki We could get it from Husam's store. No, no, we will get it from Mahmud, his Raki is very good. And fuck the fiddler of yours, too. Come on. (baby laughs) (music ends) I found my son. He's still with the tranny. I have great news, too. I'm going to have an exhibition. A gallery called. He has grown up so much. Great. You see, everything is looking up. He looks happy and his health seems to be okay. God bless that tranny. Oh..Ah (laughs nervously) It's so lovely. Does it suit me? Of course, you are really beautiful. Anything will suit you. Thank you very much. (baby giggles) Thank Evgenia for me. Thank you, little boy with my name. See you next week doctor. Meli.. You love him now, don't you? Yes doctor. Very much. More than anything. Listen, I live directly above the clinic. Let me give you my number, if anything comes up you can call me anytime. There you go. Thank you. (Suzan laughing) Disgusting. Maybe, but it's not the blouse that counts, it's the thought. That's why I still see him. Just the love he gives to a baby who was thrown on the street by his own mother, shows that he's more human than many people I love. What are you trying to say? Are you insinuating that I'm less? No Suzan, of course not. I'm sorry, I'm a bit distracted. I can see that, that's why I asked. Why don't you talk to me? Has it got anything to do with Uncle's visit? No.. I told you. Dad was here for business, our meeting was a coincidence. Infact, there's no reason why I should be distracted. Maybe, there is. I think I know why I'm all nerves. There's this man. A surgeon. And? And, I like him. What's his name? Jan. I have two tickets for a concert on Saturday night. Classical music. If you don't like it, we can go somewhere else. I like classical music. What are you doing, girl? I'm hanging the curtains. I open the window a bit and they dry in no time. Let me help you. No, no, you'll be late for work. I have time, I don't want to go to work, anyway. Why? It's Saturday, the club will be packed. Have to entertain the crowd till morning. It's weird with Remzi, after that fight.. (screams and crash) (groaning) What are you trying to do girls? Wreck the house? Don't shout, Mama, you'll wake Deniz. Are you joking? My shout is nothing compared to the noise you've made. Oh my god, it took me ages to put him to sleep. (heavy breathing) Ah.. Thank God, he's still asleep. What's the matter? (Whispering) He is deaf. Who's deaf? Who else girl? Deniz. The expected disaster has struck. (loud crying and wailing) We are doomed Madame. What's wrong? (crying) Deniz, Mama. Don't drive me mad, girls. What's wrong with the kid? He's maimed, Madame, he's gone deaf. He won't be able to speak all his life My poor baby will live in a silent world not hearing a sound, not speaking a word. (wailing) You said he's gone deaf. Why can't he speak? Idiot. How will he be able to learn how to speak, if he can't hear? (wailing) For shit sake. Will you tell me what's going on? Madame, Deniz didn't wake up with all that noise, he's gone deaf. Oh come on. How did you come to that conclusion? We didn't, Madame, the doctor already told us that high fever could have done some damage to the brain. She was expecting some disorder anytime. Bullshit. Then you can take him to her, she can examine the child, see if he's deaf. What, are you doctors now? Thank you, Madame. You are so clever. Where the hell did I put her number? Meli, please. Stay calm. What's the point of bringing the child here? There's nothing I can do now. Meli. You're being ridiculous. I said, bring him to the hospital on Monday. Calm down. Good night Damn woman. She's playing dirty on me now. Would you believe that? Fuck my brains, I will never learn. I trust everybody. You remember you said to me she was good woman? And I said like shit she is, remember? I told you, then I went and believed her. Could you imagine that? Fuck my brains. What shall we do now? Meli, Pediamu (my child) Calm down, be rational. Tell us, what did she say? There's nothing to be done now, she said. She said, we should take Deniz to the hospital on Monday. Well, she is a doctor, isn't she? She might be right. Think calmly. How can I think calmly, Madame? How will I go through this night? How can I wait for Monday? Of course, she is fine. That's not her child, the child is not with her. (quiet crying) Come on girl, let's go. Meli, where are you going? Don't do anything rash. Endaksi (Alright)? Don't worry Madame, I'm doing what's best for Deniz. (doorbell rings) Here he is, I'm dying to see this man. Go and open the door. (door slams) Damn him. Who, Jan? No. Who then? What the hell is going on? Go and see for yourself. God, how will I find him? Deniz, won't you tell me what's going on? Who is this baby? Meli's baby, who else? Who the hell is Meli? Suzan, how many times are you going to ask the same question? The tranny you saw in my office. How many times do I have to tell you? Look here, Deniz. Please come to your senses. You should better listen.. No. You listen, little fool. Firstly, that is not your office, it's mine. Secondly, this isn't your home either, it is mine, too. Really? Thirdly and lastly, I don't have to put up with you, you'll be raping my rights because of your weird relations with perverts. Now you hear me out. First. neither this office, nor this apartment belong to you. They're owned by father, whom you call uncle. Second, we are both his puppets. Third, you are more of a fool, more naive and even more ignorant then I am. I don't have to rape your rights because your rights are already like a whore. Raped by the closest people to you. You've had no rights since the day you were born. Just like me. Just like this baby. Just like Meli. The tranny, remember? Deniz. Do you hear what you are saying? - Listen.. Deniz: Now we are burdened with this baby, forget it. What the hell are we going to do? (footsteps) (cat screeches) (police sirens) (cat screeches) Excuse me, can we talk for a while? I am late for work, if you want to meet me, come to Madame Margot. No, no, I want to talk about something else. You found a baby in the street. Don't worry, I am not with the police, I am just a friend of his mother's. I found no baby. Look, don't make it difficult. I don't want to go to the police. I've been following you for a while. I know your house, the night club, and everything. Are you the father? No, just a good friend of the mother's. Please help us out, the child's life is at sake. His bitch of a mother should've thought of that before she threw him out onto the street. She had a nervous breakdown. Look, she's a prostitute You live in the same world as her. You know what kind of a bad time a girl can have. Yes I do know, but I don't have the kid any more. Where is he then? I was forced to throw him to the street, too. I couldn't look after him. Where did you throw him? I left him in a park. Which park? The weather was nice, I left him in a park early in the morning. Someone must have found him within an hour. Okay, but which park? Machka park. I put him on a bench close to the street, so that someone would be able to hear him when he cried. When did you leave him? Three, four days ago. Of course, it was Saturday. If you don't believe me, let's go back to my place and you can have a look. Aylin: He's lying. The stupid faggot. No.. He's telling the truth. I've been watching the house for two days, now. I haven't seen any baby. He lives with a gay boy and an old woman. The other night, the boy and the woman went out somewhere, before they returned, the tranny left for the nightclub. So? What's that supposed to mean? That means there was no one at home. They wouldn't leave a baby alone at home, would they? They could have left him with a neighbor. Why should they? They would have taken him with them. It was bound to happen, I guess. Even I couldn't look after him, how could a man handle it? He looked after my child more than I did. He thought better than you, too. He says, someone must have taken him within an hour. (sobs) Okay, don't cry, we will find him. How? God knows who took him this time? Who? Who would have taken him? Nobody is as crazy as that damn tranny. Of course.. What would anybody do, if they found a baby in the park? They would take him to the police, let's go. Excuse me, Officer, was there a baby found in Machka Park last Saturday? What was the date? Ummm.. Today is the eighth.. Third. Ali: Yes so it must be the third. (silently praying) Yeah. A six month old baby boy. (cello music) Good morning. Haven't you gone to bed yet? I'm not sleepy. Poor darling.. He has been playing all night. (cello music ends) You miss him, don't you? I miss him a lot, too. (cello music) The house isn't the same. The time has stopped without him. It's not only that, we're about to get into trouble. What's up? Yesterday, I was going to the club. A friend of Deniz's mother stopped me. They're looking for the baby. You should've given them the Doctor's address. We have done her wrong. Don't be ridiculous. Even we couldn't deal with his illness. How can his whore of a mother deal with it? (cello music ends) Deniz is in safe hands. (baby crying) Oh my God, it stinks in here. (laughter) Stop laughing and hold his feet. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea feeding him what we eat. That would explain the stench. (baby cries and screams) What would I know? I did everything like the book said. (baby screams and cries) (chuckles) Sh, shh, shhh I'm dead. Let me put him in the bed, I'll be back. (crying stops) Oh God, it's so exhausting looking after a baby. You deserve all this. Why? Do I deserve this because I help a baby who was abandoned by his mother? (phone vibrates) Dr. Deniz. Oh, thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. Good evening to you. He's not deaf. The child isn't deaf. Good for him. Aren't you pleased? Deniz. You forget that our family has roots. You consort with cheap homosexuals, whores and their bastards. Really? Only the likes of us have rights, is that it? Doesn't this little baby have any rights? Come on, don't try to confuse the issue, I didn't mean it that way. Everyone creates their own rights. How do you expect this little baby to create his own rights? He doesn't even have a birth certificate. He will wait all his life for Lady Suzan and good families to give him a break? Deniz, you're starting to get on my nerves again. You have become so insolent since you have been in contact with these kind of people. What do you mean, these kind of people? Do you mean bastards? We are also two of those people. Deniz, I forbid you. You can't do a damned thing. Stop this insolence at once, you fool. You are the biggest fool of us all. Do you know who you are? What you are? You're a bastard too. That does it. I don't have to hear your filth anymore. But you must. I just learned the truth. Would you like to know the truth? You were curious why Dad came to Istanbul. Well, let me tell you.. When your Mother was 16, and my Father 15 (dramatic music) they fell in love with each other. They knew that our family with roots wouldn't allow two cousins' marriage. So they kept it a secret. They thought, it was a phase, and they'd get over it in time. But they didn't. It got worse. Then, one day.. Your Mom was pregnant. Deniz, you're lying. Nobody suspected Dad, of course. Dad influenced your grandad, sticking up for his cousin. They easily solved the problem on paper, creating an imaginary groom and his sudden death, which was announced to everyone concerned. Remember your Father who died in an accident? That's the one. Sit down. I'm not finished yet. You should hear my side of the story, too. (sighs) Then, Dad went to university in Istanbul. As your Mother longed for him back home, one night his friends took him out for a good time. (music intensifies) He spent the night with the most reputable and beautiful woman of leisure in Pera. And guess what? They fell in love. (music fades out) Da da da da. (dramatic music starts) Just like La Dame aux Camelias, isn't it? Just before Father graduated and returned home, she got pregnant. And guess who was born? Yours, truely. Early years I haven't seen Dad who's supposed to have a business in Germany. Then supposedly, Mother joined him and an old woman looked after me. As I grew older, Mother couldn't deal with my questions, given that she only saw me once or twice a month. So she decided to write a letter to Dad. Poor Dad, ran to me with pain and curiosity. When he saw how much I looked like him, he couldn't resist taking me. (sarcastically discards) It's the blood, see? He immediately found my Mom, they again fixed the formalities and fooled me with this story that she died in Germany. Why did he tell you all this? You won't believe it. Guilty conscience, he said. He had to tell somebody. What a lie. You know what he asked of me? He asked of me to find my Mother. You see? It's not me. He thinks he's unfair to the woman. The woman who had me without his consent and without thinking about my future. Sit down, I'm not finished yet. Now do you understand why we are bastards? And I? What am I? A bastard, and a daughter of a whore. And that father of mine wishes to find the woman so that she can see me once more before she dies. So.. We had this conversation, and the next day, in the early hours of the morning this baby was brought to me. Is he any different than I was, when I was born? Poor thing.. What does he know? So don't you ever talk to me about tradition, class, roots or anything. There are so many supposedly human beings, who were done wrong. We are the luckiest. This baby has less of a chance. Meli and Evgenia have no chance at all. So don't you dare belittle them. Damn you. (music ends) It's fucking Saturday night again. I hope Deniz's Mother doesn't stir things up. Don't be silly, girl. It's been so long. That damn whore forgot she had a son. She won't look for him anymore. Stupid woman. I am more worried about that fucking Doctor. I hope she hasn't given my son to an orphanage. Suzan please talk to me. It's been days. Why are you so angry with me? I didn't mean to hurt you. Why are you angry with me? Am I responsible for what Father did? Answer me. Okay, don't talk to me. Father, you...That homo, Meli. Father has satisfied his guilty conscience. You are getting rid of your anger by blaming me. Meli got out of his responsibility. (grunts in dispair) That Meli... The son of a bitch is enjoying himself in that nightclub while I look after his bastard here. The nightclub... ♪ I planted a Lemon Tree in the stone (audience clapping in time with song) ♪ Lemon, my love ♪ I planted a Lemon Tree in the stone ♪ Lemon, my love ♪ It didn't grow ♪ We'll wait for the winter. ♪ It didn't grow ♪ We'll wait for the winter ♪ Lover's white arms ♪ Lemon, my love ♪ Lover's white arms ♪ Lemon, my love ♪ Were not long enough to embrace me ♪ Were not long enough to embrace me ♪ I asked for Lemons and got Pomegrantes (music dies down, microphone screeches) You low down creature. Take your bastard. He's not deaf either. If you think you'll get away with this, you're very much mistaken. The show must go on. (music starts) I can't believe you've done this to me. (baby cries) You made me the laughing stock of the club. You made me look the right schmuck. I won't let you get away with this, Okay? You cheated on me. What's more, with a fucking woman. And I'm so stupid. I thought you had a man. Meanwhile you were with a fucking woman, and you breed a little bastard, on top of it all. You are just a low down breeder. You hear? Low down breeder. (baby giggles) (light switch on) (baby noises) (emotional music) (music ends) What's wrong with you? Are you fucking kidding me? I can't believe it. How many times did you cheat on me? Isn't it enough? Are you.. Are you serious? What's wrong with you? (clanking of cutlery) Miss Meli, the Boss wants to see you. Good evening Boss. Good evening Meli, come sit down. You know, I like you. Thank you Boss. I also like you, and respect you. You proved to be the only decent man in this house of fairies. Well done. Please let me explain, Boss. No, no need to. Meli, son... Whatever perversion you may have lived, you found the right way at last. You've become a man again. Man again? And what a man. A father. Look, no one knows this.. Go get my coat from the car. I've divorced five women. The present one is eighteen. But, I'm still not a father. At first, I blamed the women, but now I know, it's me. I can't be a father, Meli. It's a blessing to be a father. So I respect you. Thanks Boss. Call me Suleyman. Thanks, Suleyman. Take this dress off. Go find that woman. Cherish her. Marry her. Raise your child in a happy home. A father cannot live this perverted life. I think there has been a misu... Suleyman: Look, Meli, son. What's with this Meli business anyway? Don't you have a normal name? Fikri, Suleyman.. That's better, Fikri, son... Look... I don't want you to work as a... Like this. Do not ask me, or anybody else for this kind of job again. If I see you.. Or hear about it.. Son, it's not good. I'll break your legs. Deniz Will you sit with me a while? I've thought a lot. First I blamed everybody. You first, then Uncle. and my Father, then my Mother Until there was no one else to blame. Finally, I realized you must have suffered more than I did. I also realized you are much wiser than I. You see things much clearer. As I was leading my happy life... not knowing what was going on... You had an unhappy childhood without a mother or a father... And I added to your unhappiness. Forgive me. (cries) You know what hurt most? Father chose to tell you all this, and not me. He could have at least talked to both of us. (cries) All my childhood, I wished that Uncle had been my Dad. But... Now I know, father doesn't really love me. (cries) You are wrong. Father loves you more than he loves me. He upset me, but didn't want to upset you. He didn't want me to tell you any of this. He asked me not to. But I... I was overcome with a moment's anger. (cries) I don't know. I think it is a bit.. You'll have to take off the nail varnish. I feel funny. Alright. But why? Meli: Why what? Why you become a man all of a sudden? I can't work the clubs anymore. Instead of working as a sex labourer on the highways, in man clothes, I can do any type of work. You're not telling the truth. Why? (clarinet music) Madame.. I.. I loved for the first time in my life.. I'm even ready to die for Deniz. (baby cries) (sobbing) Meli I wish I was once as brave as you are. (takes a deep breath) (music ends) I'll do the washing up. But there's a dishwasher, my hands won't be ruined. Oh sister it's so... Meli: Don't call me sister anymore. I wish I could find some work. Don't be silly. You have to look after Deniz for now. Let's find a mother for Deniz first. (rebetiko music) Mama, you won't believe this. Meli decided to get married. Who's the groom? Not a groom Mama, a woman. (music stops) Jesus Christ. Sister. How can you marry a woman? Have you gone mad? Just think, girl. All problems will be solved. I will make up a story that my wife died during birth... And say that's why I never had a chance to get the child's birth certificate. Then, we can go to the registry office and get the certificate as if he is our very own child. Madame, now this is your show. You know everybody in the neighbourhood. Ask around, find me a wife. A widow, maybe. Are you sure? Yes. I don't know? What do you mean? I feel sorry for the woman too, you know. My husband died of a heart attack. It's been two years. Well, destiny. Yeah, sure. You know, many suitors came. But I didn't want them. I understand, so you loved your husband. Yeah, sure. He was a lot older than me. How's yours? Pardon? Your heart and everything, are you healthy? Quite, thank God. Bless you. You are like a ram. Thank you. Madam Naciye, are you fond of children? Yes, very much. But I couldn't have any. Obviously, my husbands age. You may have wondered what I've done for two years, right? Please, your past is no concern of mine. I swear, not any man touched my hand for two years. What concerns me is Deniz. I want him to grow in a happy home, have a mother. Sure. As I said, I love children. May I have a Chicken Breast Pudding? I beg your pardon? A Chicken Breast Pudding, you know? Talking about children, funny things came to my mind. What funny things? You know.. What happens before having a child. If I have a pudding, I will forget about it. Waiter. May I have a Chicken Breast Pudding? Waiter: Yes Madam. Chicken Breast Pudding for the lady. With ice-cream. (repeats her silently) I think we should get to know each other closely, before we get married. What do you mean? No way. Never before the wedding. You misunderstand. You know, we should know what each other likes, etc. Oh... I like going to the cinema. Do you? Meli: Sure, I like films too. There is a new film. With that handsome actor. That huge muscly man. Meli: Oh... I'm crazy about him, shall we go? Madame: How did you find her? Meli: Hmm... Well.. I don't know..Just a woman, I guess.. Then we went to see a movie, a good one. The guy was huge. I was so involved with the guy, at one point I thought I was holding his hand.. and I was actually holding the woman's hand. (laughter) Well, when are you seeing her again? Hello, come in. Hello, I better not, we don't have much time. Come in, come in, I'll get ready right away. Thanks for the flowers. Let me take them. You're welcome. Do sit down. Chocolate? No, thanks. You have a big apartment. Yes, it is. Left to me by my late husband. But you should see the bedroom. Liqueur? Better not. We don't have a lot of time. What is time, for God's sake? We'll leave immediately. Enjoy. Cheers. Between you and me, I love Liqueur. Take a chocolate. We'll be late for the movie. You should see the actor in this movie, he's so yummy. Never mind dear, the movies are always there, another? Enough for me, if you.. I must say, I will have another. Might as well. We've missed the next performance. We'll never make it. Never mind, dear. We will go to the performance after next. So many of them, anyway. (giggles) This Liqueur... (chuckles) Makes me so.. Makes me so gay. I see. Come on, I'll show you around No, need to.. Naciye: our apartment. And this is our bedroom. It's very big, isn't it? Yes, it is big. It's big enough to take our love in it. Every night. Oh, I feel so warm. Naciye.. Call me, "my Naciye". When you held my hand in the cinema, you've woken desires within me. And since that night.. This bed seems too big for me, when I'm alone. Naciye, maybe we shouldn't hurry. We should, we're already late. You said, we can't before the wedding. (panting) We can, we can, why not? This is a special moment, we should save it for our wedding night. We can do it then as well. Every night and every day. (heavy breathing) You can't do this to me. You can't leave me like this. I'm so sorry, I'm very sorry.. I told you it would be difficult. She treated me like a whore. Don't even think about it. There's a lot of women for you. We'll find one. The court cases and all those, it's just stupid. The tranny lied. No, he didn't He didn't have the baby. You must believe it. Well.. I have some bad news for you. The landlord is kicking me out. I have to go back to my Mother's place. I'm sorry.. (people talking) Your Raki is in the kitchen Mama, please serve yourself. I'll feed him (baby gurgles) (applause from outside) (sad music) (laughter and chatting) (crying) The court will not give the child to the mother. Why not, I thought we won the case? (sighs) That's right we did, we proved you are the mother. But in cases like this, the court may not give the child to the mother, because of the mother's social status. Because of my social status? Does that mean that.. Because I'm a whore? Do they think that I'm doing it for kicks? (sighs) What now? The child will be given to a home. You can see him twice a week. When you can take care of him, you can have him. (sarcastically approves) Like shit I am. First, I gotta find a home, and then I need to earn money. Who would give me any money if I don't fuck them? Tell her, I said that, our love will fill that big bedroom of hers. Tell her that I couldn't do anything because I was too much in love with her. And tell her that.. Okay, okay. I know what a woman wants to hear. I am a woman, too, you know. (cello music) (sobs) Don't be sad. We have to get used to this. There is no happiness in love for us. (sobs) We shouldn't fall in love. Maybe this is the worst thing of being a homosexual. (cries) How will I live in this apartment? Listen, I have an idea. Because of that bitch, we couldn't even take Deniz to the park for days. Let's go on a vacation. We all go to the seaside somewhere. We will take Naciye with us. Clean air will do us all good. What would I have done without you? (bursts into tears) (door knocks) Good evening, can you please give this to Dr. Deniz? You can say it's from, Jan, surgery. For sure, Doctor. She will be here any moment now. Thank you. I got straight to the point. I said our Fikri is burning with your love, I said. Did you tell her that, I couldn't do anything that day, because I was too much in love with her? I did, I told her the whole spiel. She laughed and she said: Madame I'm in love myself. I'm flying in the sky. I've got my plumber. Who the hell is the plumber? I was about to ask her that, this young man walked in. What a man, Hercules himself, barely in his 20's He had his pants on, naked on top. Even my heart went tip tap at my age, when I saw him. Madame never mind the plumber's wrench, who the hell is he? The woman had a tap leaking, she called a plumber. This boy turned up, and they didn't go out of the bed for three days. I bet, the tap is still leaking. I can't believe there are women like this. The boy came, sat next to Naciye and said: Where have you been, my little dove? You should have seen the silly woman, she went all gaga. I was just afraid that she was going to take his pants off and have him right there in front of me. She would, she almost got my pants off. Well? Well, you will have to forget Naciye. The plumber is happy. Oh my God, what am I going to do? Forget her, you can't handle that oversexed woman anyway. You said there will be many woman who will marry me. Where are they? Why do you think I was so late? I went door to door, telling people to keep their eyes open for a woman who wants to get married. Don't worry, in a couple of days, they will come up with a candidate. (cello music) (door opens) Wake up, sister, wake up, wake up. What's up? Mama.. She's very ill. (door knocks) The last hour goes by so slowly on night duty. I can't believe we are almost finished. (phone ringing) Surgery May I speak to Dr. Jan, please? He's in the operating theatre right now, would you like to leave a message? No, I'll call him later. I.. I totally forgot to tell you, Dr. Jan from surgery came and left you a note. I forgot to tell you. Where did I put it? I'm so sorry doctor, but it has almost been twelve hours. Underdone steak, Blood and juice on it. (laughter) A bit of salt, a bit of black pepper. Excuse me. Ok, butchers we're done. Make sure the stitches are aesthetic Remember that our patient is an attractive young lady. Doctor, they just brought in a patient, an elderly lady. Aorta is blocked and she has an hour at the most. If we wait for the day shift, she's not gonna make it. Prepare her. I remember now. That's the one, I'm so sorry again, doctor. Have a good day. "SHALL WE START AGAİN.. IF YOU WANT TO WORK ON IT, FIND ME AT ONCE. I'LL BE INTHE OPERATING THEATRE TILL MORNING. JAN" Evgenia: Mama please don't die. (crying) I love you. Evgenia, kardiyamu (my heart). Don't be upset You've got Meli. He's everything to you now. If I die, don't be upset. I've had a good life, and I am content. The only last wish I have is.. What, Mama? Nurse: We need to take her to the theatre. Right now? (crying) This operation is a heart operation. More blood, I warn you. (coughs) Yeah, that sounds great. I'm going to call you back. I'm sorry, Doctor. It's okay, did anyone call me? One moment, please. Ah yes, a lady called, she didn't leave her name though, she said she'll call again. Thank you. Doctor.. The lady they just took in is my mama. Please save her. We will do our best. Please trust me. (crying) Oh, I feel so good. The room is full of pink clouds. (laughter) My Deniz, three years old, sitting on them. You can't come in here. I'm a doctor. He is expecting me. Please wait here, Doctor. Lord Jesus I know I am a sinner. You have every right to send me to hell. But I beg you. Please show me my daughter for the last time. (dramatic music) Doctor is expecting you. Pleaae wait for a little, Doctor. I'm praying to Lord Jesus. What do you want from the Lord? I want him to show me my daughter, for the last time. Pray to Mohammed as well. They are the prophets of the same God. You are right.. Lord Mohammed.. I lived all my life with Muslims. This is your country. I know what I have done is a sin in your religion, too. But I repent. Please, have a word with Lord Jesus. That's it. (dramatic music) Now allow us to put this mask on your face, I promise you'll see your daughter. She's here. Lord Jesus, Lord Mohammed.. Thank you. My girl.. Take.. Take off your mask, please. (takes a deep breath) You have grown so much. But you're still so beautiful. Come closer, please. No pulse. (solid tone on heart monitor) 150 Joules, now (sad music) Don't think about it. It was the influence of the sedation But, she looked at me so beautifully. She won't be looking at anything else anymore. She's lucky that the last thing she looked at, was a beautiful girl like you. The last thing she touched was your hand. (electric doors open) I'm really sorry, but we lost your mother. (crying) Doctor, I'm finished. I can't live without her. My condolences, Evgenia. Please don't upset yourself, she died very happy. Sister, what are we going to do without her? (crying) So you're a man now? But it's not going to save you. Where's the baby? We left him with the neighbor. Okay, I have done you wrong. I'm sorry, but did I do it out of spite? You told me to call you if I needed any help with him. Alright, this is neither the place, nor the time. You will give the baby to the authorities. (cries) (seagulls squawking) (cruiser steam horn) Evgenia: It has been so long, but I still think I forgot mama's Raki everytime we go home. We will get used to it, sweetheart. Heart breaker Don't tell me.. It's not what you think darling. You.. How could you do this to me? (laughter) The woman looked as if she just fell off a donkey. (chuckles) The fiddler will have some explaining to do now. It's so nice to see you laugh again. I missed your laugh. I am left all alone in this big apartment. Why should you be alone? I'm here, Deniz is here. At least for the time being. What do you mean, for the time being? Don't worry, mama couldn't find you a woman, but I will get you married. It's too late now.. I couldn't sleep a wink last night. You remember, we said we will fight for Deniz? Yes. We lost the fight. It's impossible to set a good life for Deniz, now. It's just you and me from now on. We have to look after each other. (emotional music) But, we should be thankful. Loneliness is our destiny. To be gay is a lonesome journey. I just hope Deniz won't be like us or all those glue sniffing kids on the streets. Don't we ask a lot from God? (music ends) Let me hug you for the last time, Son. Deniz My darling baby. I wish you could have understood me. I can't tell how difficult it is to part with you. I hope you will have a happy home and a family who loves you as much as we did. You will forget me. You will never know, someone wanted to be a mother and father to you, and never succeeded. (baby cries) But I won't be able to forget you, all my life. And I'll always be your Papa. He doesn't want to go. He wants to stay with you, he doesn't want to go. (dramatic music starts) Look girl, it's that woman again. What woman? (baby cries) Why do you keep following me, woman? You're his mother, aren't you? You wanted to kill him. You wished him dead. That's why you threw him where nobody could have found him. I could'nt have looked after him. When I was sure he was dead, I was going to kill myself. When you saved him, I was scared. I didn't want to die, leaving him on this cruel world. I wanted to take him back from you, that's why I followed you. (sobs) But I still don't have anything to give him. I don't even have a home. (crying) But I'm not as hopeless as I was when I first had him. You gave me hope, you gave me confidence. What do you say, Evgenia? Shall we take Deniz's Mother in our apartment to live with us? Madame's room is empty now. Yes, please, Sister. I mean Fikri. You can call me Sister again. Ok, we're all going home. Give the boy to his Mom. (baby stops crying) (baby crying) (theme music)
