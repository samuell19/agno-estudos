The house of Snow White survives. You must complete that work. In the ruin of my castle, you will find the source of my power. (dramatic music) These are my gifts. They give you my power. Mirrors to travel. Mirrors to spy. Mirrors to remember. Mirrors to forget. Mirrors to rule the world! (majestic music) - So good to have the power back. (fire crackling) - Frying tonight, frying tonight! - Keep away from me! - Frying tonight! - I mean it! - Listen to this, a present for the strongest, bravest troll. (laughing) Oh, you know what it smells like? (inhaling) - (together) Leather! (laughing) - Shoes! - Well it could be books. - And my size by the look of things. (fighting) - They're mine, it's a present for me and you know it, - No they're mine! - Mine! - Let's spin a coin to decide who gets them. (Punch) - Well, hello! Rescue is at hand! - Don't come any nearer! - Don't worry, I'm not who I used to be. I've had extensive therapy. I realized I have been using food as a substitute for love and I have the books to prove it. Breaking the Cycle. Heal Yourself in Seven Days. Stop Blaming Yourself, Please. And Help for the Bedwetting Child, which I picked up by mistake but I've got them all! - You come an inch closer and I swear I'll shout my head off. - Ooo, that is what's known as an empty threat. (inhaling) (howling) I hope you don't mind me saying this, but I get the feeling you still don't completely trust me. - I don't trust you at all! You tried to eat my grandmother! - Oh, no! I was just being playful. See wolfies just pretend to do naughty things. I would have never really eaten her, she was tough old bird. I wouldn't hurt a sausage. Butter would not melt in my mouth. Well, it would melt, of course it would melt, but very slowly. Argh! Puff! I give you my solemn wolf word, you are safe with me. You are as safe as a, brick-built pig house! Now, wait here a moment while I plan our escape we are in romantically, reckless danger. How are you at climbing? I nearly fell off three times coming up. - Those incredible shoes. They made them invisible. - Yeah, I know. - Yeah, but they made them invisible. (magical music) - Well don't touch them, they'll make you want to wear them all the time. Balcony, or corridor? That is the question. - I'm not going to touch them, I just want to see how they work. - They're working on you even now. Just leave them well alone. (magical music) Corridor I think. No! Balcony, quick, there's someone coming! (dramatic music) Excuse me, excuse me, where do you think you're going exactly? - Back to prison. - Back to prison? See that wouldn't be my first choice. - No, I'm going to find my father and then I'm going to go right back home. - Alright, alright, alright! But not this way. Virginia, please listen. You won't survive five minutes unless you follow me. Now we must avoid this road. Go this way. (thunder claps) (dramatic music) - No way am I going in there. (thunder claps) (maniacal laughter) (thunder claps) Brave Jack. Jack? - Jack and the beanstalk, the first mayor of Beantown. You know this, this used to be a very prosperous area before all the beanstalks sprouted everywhere and polluted the land. The trolls were given it as their kingdom, that's why they hate Prince Wendell so much because he has a juicy, fertile kingdom and they have a polluted disgusting kingdom. (suspenseful music) Virginia? (thunder claps) Virginia? Virginia? Virginia, Virginia, Virginia, please tell me you didn't take the troll king's magic shoes. Virginia? Virginia? Virginia? - Idiots! Fools! I can't leave you alone for a minute. Your mothers would be ashamed of you. - No, no no, dad it wasn't our fault. The witch, she tricked us with this magic shoebox. - Best wishes from wolf. - Virginia? I know you think you're safe in those shoes, but nothing could be further from the truth. Anything a troll has is bound to be bad and dangerous. Virginia. Where are you? (growling) (sparks) - Oh no. - Hello again! They're not fully recharged, you see? They don't stay invisible very long without a proper break it's a design fault in the shoes, one of many in fact (laughing). (punch) (moaning) - You're not having them! - Having what? - The shoes. They're mine. - Oh, (struggle) If you don't get rid of them now you won't be able to later. - Ah, you're right, oh you're right. Oh I don't want them, they made me feel so strange. God, it felt so powerful, you know, being invisible. Just amazing! Fantastic! How did you know where I was? - I could smell you. Follow me! (growling) There's about 70 beanstalks left but not many are occupied these days. Giants drink so much they rarely have time to reproduce. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah, of course. - Do you think I'm sexy? You're the kind of man I suppose I should be scared of. - Oh Virginia. As much as I would love to believe what you're saying to me right now, I'm afraid it's the shoes that are talking. You'd say anything to put them on again. - Give them back. Come on, give em back. Oh, oh, I'm really sorry. That was weird, I don't know what came over me. - Oh, they bring out very strange things, these shoes. - Yeah - Whatever you're suppressing. - I'm not suppressing anything. (thunder claps) What? - Trolls. They found us. Oh, cripes, we're in big big trouble now. They have dogs, they're going to sniff us out. Run, run! (dogs barking) (trolls yelling) (thunder claps) - This way! The dogs are on the scent. They're very close now. They can smell 'em! Don't let them escape again! - Blue Bell, come here. Flatfoot, got any magic mushrooms? - No, but I've got some dwarf moss and it'll really blow your head off though. Look at this, the last time I took it I saw fairies for three days. (laughing) - Nicey nice! Roll us a giant. - You got it. - This may be a long night. (growling) - Blue Bell, Burly, Blaberwort? Where are you? - Coming, Dad. (thunder claps) - The beanstalk has a potent smell, it puts off the dogs. - You don't have to tell me. - We'll stay up here for a little while till it's safe. - So how did you get involved in all this anyway? - Ah, I found myself at a loose end, and you know.. - You were in that prison weren't you? What were you in for? - Well nothing much, just a little bit of sheep worrying that's all. Putting a wolf into a prison cell with nowhere to bound only able to stare at the sky through bars, now that's inhuman. - Do you think maybe I should, you know put them on again? - What? - No, I mean, the shoes are probably fully recharged and. I can... - No! - No! - What is that? - It's just my tail. - Your tail? What? - Well it's not very big at this time of month. It's just a little brush. - You've got a tail? - Yeah, so? You have succulent breasts, I don't go on about them all the time, do I? Why don't you touch it? It's perfectly normal. - If it's normal how come you keep it hidden all the time? - Because if you haven't noticed, people don't like wolfs. Come on, give it a stroke. It won't bite. - (gasp) - What? What? - With the fur, not against it! (laughing) - I've got keys going missing. I've got trolls and wolves and queens missing. What in the fairy-ing forest has happened to basic security in this prison? - Sir? While we were searching the prison we found that the door to the cellars was unlocked at the time of the queen's break-out. - [Prince] Cellar? Did he just say cellar? - It is possible she escaped that way. - What's down there? You. - It's just some old junk, sir. It's been there for hundreds of years, before this place was a prison. - [Prince] The mirror! - Take the work detail off the laundry room, have them clear out the whole place, top to bottom. Now, get out. (dramatic music) - [Prince] Oh no, that's the mirror to the other world. I'd better put Anthony's name on the work detail. To-ny Lew-is. - Alright now, pay attention. Everything here has to be cleared out. So form a human chain, and chuck everything into that boat moored there. - Ah, excuse me? - What? - Well, we're kind of far away from the boat, aren't we in danger of some of the more delicate objects being broken? - What do you think this is Lewis? An elves underwear party? Look, this is scrap, now do as you're told! - I'm... - And shut it! (shattering) - Huffety puffety, there it is! - Oh God, I hope he's okay in there. He can take care of himself, right? I mean he can stay out of trouble for one day at least. Can't he? - Well, from what I know about your father, I very much doubt it. (shattering) - (whispering) Mirror, on. Mirror, on on, mirror, mirror. - Lewis? What in the fairy-ing forest do you think you're doing? - It's not working. - Listen Lewis, you little prison princess. Throw that mirror on that boat, now! - Uh, no I can't, I'm afraid it'll break. - As you've refused to obey my instructions, I am going to push you into the river. And as you are connected by leg irons to each of your comrades, they will also, sadly, drown. - Alright, alright, alright. (smashing) - OK, you wait here. I'll put the magic shoes on and I'll go back inside the prison. - No way, you'll never come back, you just want them for yourself! - No, no I don't. - You do! - Yes, I do, but, oh, I'm fighting it! Unlike you! (growling) I have an idea. - What? - I'll wear them, you hold onto me, because if you're touching me, we'll both be invisible. - No! I will wear them. And you can hold onto me. - You are hopelessly addicted to those shoes. And I'm not too far behind. (magical music) (door squeaking) - Curses! - Now we'll have to kill him. - A tunnel! - Shh! - We've been digging for 31 years. - Oh, but please take me with you, please? Listen I swear, you can trust me. You know what, at home, I've got Escape from Alcatraz on video. I know how to do this! - Best we suffocate him I think. - No. I trust him. - Uh, thanks. I would give you my watch, but it already went somewhere. - [Virginia] Ten months, just for being cheeky, what are they going to do with dad? - [Wolf] They've probably put your father in E block, that's where new prisoners usually go, let's go there. - [Virginia] Puppy slaying? What about Prince? (dog barking) Listen? Listen that must be him, that's Prince. (dog barking) - [Wolf] No, Virginia, what are you doing? No, we can't take him with us. He'll drain all the power in the shoes and we'll become visible. Virginia! Oh, I hate dogs. - Hey, hey hey guys, wait up, huh? - Sorry, Tony. It's every man for himself. - Oh never mind, just go right ahead, go, go. - [Virginia] I think he's leading us to dad's cell. - [Wolf] This is it! - [Virginia] Dad, Dad are you in here? (magical sparks) - No! Oh, they're exhausted. I told you this was going to happen. (dog barking) - Look! - Boy, your father sure works fast, I give him that. (suspenseful music) - Yes! Sure you don't want to come with me? - A goblin travels fastest alone. (dramatic music) (splash) - Yes! Haha. - There's something blocking the tunnel. Tony is that you? - Who's that? It's me, Wolf, I gave you the magic dragon dung beetle, remember me? - You know what, just stay away from me? - We're in a tunnel together, how can I do that? - I'm almost out too, but I'm stuck. Look, just give me a push! - OK, (grunting) - Oh Dad. - Are you alright? - Yeah, ow. We have to find a way to get back in and get the mirror. - What? No, no we don't. I threw it on a trash barge, I think on this river right here. - Come on, Which one? Which one? - No, it was right there. - Where? - They moved it, I bet you it's over here. - Where? - It was right here - Where? - Oh, look they took it. Acorn's stolen it. - Oh no, he's got our mirror! - Mirror, wake from your sleep. (glass breaking) (dramatic music) Summon Relish, the Troll King. - Tony, get this thing moving. - I'm trying, I'm trying. - Look, there they are. Don't let them get away! - Oh, cripes! (yelling) - Oh! Dad! - Oh my, get down, look out! (yelling) (splashing) - Get 'em, get 'em, hit 'em! Hit them with something! (yelling) - Argh, you're done! - In your dream troll boy! (beating) (yelling) - What a pathetic display. How dare you call yourselves my children. You are the most... (growling) (yelling) - Are you alright, Dad? (moaning) - What's wrong? - Mirror. Find me a mirror. - Out! Get out! (glass breaking) - So good of you to join me. - You do that again to me and I'll kill ya! - Well? - Well what? - Have your children caught the dog for me? - Not exactly. - You do surprise me, your majesty. How could he possibly escape your tiny little grasp? - Don't you talk to me that way! - He must be caught. Send your children after him. And what are you still doing in Wendell's kingdom? Return to your palace immediately. Await my further orders. - I don't take orders from you! (flute music) (hawk calling) (suspenseful music) - Virginia? Would you say that you were hungry for love and approval but, destined for rejection? - I'm quite happy as I am thank you. - Really? - What no, no, no! What did you do that for?! - I had to for your own good. - You threw away my shoes! - You were already dreaming of wearing them tonight, weren't you? - Yes! I... How did you know that? - Magic is very nice, but it's very easy to get addicted. - But why didn't you want them? How come you were able to resist the shoes and I wasn't? - Because you have such a strong desire to be invisible. (sad music) - [Prince] Anthony, I know that as my new manservant you will never let me down, and will willingly give your life to save mine, but I wonder if you'd like to swear a formal oath of allegiance. Destiny has brought us together, that much is clear. My destiny is to rule the Fourth Kingdom, of course, but what is yours? Someone as lowly as inconsequential as yourself, may yet have an important part to pay, even if it is catering to my every whim whilst I'm trapped in the body of a dog. What was that? - Nothing. Fish, I don't know. (crowd jeering) - I insist you leave. Trolls are not allowed in the Fourth Kingdom without proper permits. This is a gross violation of the Nine Kingdoms treaty. - Shut your mouth. - Unless you leave this instant, I shall notify Prince Wendell, and soldiers will be sent. (crowd yelling) - I am declaring war on the Fourth Kingdom, and I challenge Price Wendell to come and face me within seven days. Or I will claim his kingdom as my own. (crowd yelling) - [Wolf] Rise and shine! Wakey Wakey (howling) it's another beautiful day in the Fourth Kingdom. Sleep well, Virginia? - Actually, no, I just got to sleep an hour ago. - Oh, you should have joined me on deck, sleeping under the stars, it was quite magnificent. You look outstandingly gorgeous in the morning, pert from the front, and a vision from behind! - Hey, hey, hey! - What? - Just don't look at my daughter like that. - Is it this look, Tony? (panting) Ooo, I can't help it. It's animal passion. - Oh, just, look, just stay away from her, alright, you've got a criminal record. - Well how can I stay away from her? We're on a very small boat. I may bump into her accidentally at any given moment. - Hey! Will you stop talking about me as if I'm not here? - [Prince] Manservant? I need to go up on deck. Bring a bucket, and a shovel. - First of all I'm not your manservant. And if you think I'm going to... (bumps head) Ow, what the? - Cripes! - What is that? Whoa! - Huffety puffety. - That's one hell of a fish. Golden River gold fish. You think it's magic? - Oh, goodness gracious, yes. This is the famous, anything you touch will turn to gold fish. - What's this, warning, do not break glass except in case of financial emergency. - Uh, look at that sign, look at that. Stick a finger in my mouth turn around till you face south touch a thing that you would prize and you will not believe your eyes. Here is magic to behold all that glitters can be gold. Do you really think it turns whatever you touch into gold? - Well, I'm sure it does, but, we don't need to turn anything to gold, do we? - Well, no, I mean, no, but gold is gold, right? I mean think of the guy who owned this boat, he was no fool, he's probably now living in the lap of luxury in some Nine Kingdoms condominium with a mountain of gold in his back yard and everything his heart desires. - Best leave it alone, Tony. Best leave it alone. - Yeah, well, oh, yeah yeah yeah, best leave it alone, Tony. (fighting and yelling) - Exactly what do you think you're playing at? We had a bargain. I would give you half of Wendell's kingdom, in return for your cooperation. - You've gone (inaudible) since I broke you out of prison. - It is essential that the coronation proceed according to my plan. If you remain in Wendell's kingdom then you'll ruin everything. A crisis will inevitably ensue. - What's ensue mean? - It means, leave Beantown, return to your kingdom, or you'll ruin everything! - I might and I might not. By the way, how are my children doing? - Their intellect and bravery quite take my breath away. - Yeah. Well look after them, I want them back in one piece. - If you'll only be patient, your majesty. I will give you Wendell's kingdom on a plate. - But I'm hungry now. - Moron! (glass breaking) Mirror talk to me! Why haven't you found Wendell yet? - He is with others. But I cannot see them. - Who? - Three travel with Wendell, one who can talk with him, and one who can hurt you. They are traveling down the river towards us unknowingly. - Show me, show me. - I can not. - Wolf is with them. Work on him. Make him talk to me. ("Night Fever" by the Bee Gees) - (singing together) I get the night fever, night fever We know how to do it (singing) I get the night fever, night fever We know how to show it (singing) Here I am, waiting for this moment to last Livin' on the music so fine (music slowing down) (yelling) - Their magic is useless to brothers Gibb, ha! - Row faster! - Shut up, Blue Bell, I've rowed all night! - You shut up, Burly. - Ugh, Blue Bell, stop eating your head lice. - I wasn't chewing I was just keeping it under my tongue. - Stop talking, and row faster, Blabberwort, faster! - Oh, looky look, look there. A book! Women who love men, - Who hate women. Ha! Nicey nice. - [Tony] Wolf? You doing something about dinner or not? - Ugh, yeah, uh-huh. I'm making myself beautiful for Virginia (laughing) - Hello, Wolf. - Ah! Oh, oh, go away, leave me alone! - You agreed to obey me. - No! - Yes. I control you. - No! - Why can't I see your companions? What magic is going on? - Magic? Well, I... - ls there food or isn't there food? - No, I wasn't talking to anybody. I was making dinner. - Where is it? Well, you know what I found... (magical music) Wha? (tapping) Hey, fishy fishy fishy? (tapping) (glass breaking) Here is magic to behold All that glitters can be gold. Hello? (suspenseful music) (crunching) - Ow, oh the finger of fortune. - [Virginia] Dad? You alright, I thought I heard a crash? - Just cleaning up a little of this accidental glass breakage. - Did you put your finger in that fish? - No, well technically, yes. (yelling) Don't worry about it, we're rich now, we're rich, we're our own bank. I could, you know what, I could turn this entire boat into gold. - Yes and then it would sink and we would all drown. - Good point. OK, I'll wait, I'll wait until I find the right thing. And then when I have this huge lump of gold, you'll be thanking me. You will be thanking me! Oh yes! - (sniffing) Get some bones. Jaw bones, gnaw bones. Must find some bones. (sniffing) Mistress won't give me any bones. Steal some bones. Bury them under the sheets. And chew them when she's gone to bed. (sniffing) (dripping) (sniffing) Must. Find. Bones. - Stand up. Stand up properly. - I'm scared. - Of what? - I'll fall over. It's so high up here. Can't I fall on floors? - Do you know who you are? - Can I have a biscuit? - You are not a dog. You are Prince Wendell, you are ruler of the Fourth Kingdom. - Prince Wendell loves biscuits (panting). - Get dressed. You have a whole life to learn. Before you can be crowned king, you must be seen to demonstrate bravery, loyalty and intelligence. (panting and barking) What a challenge. (hawks calling) - Oh no. - What's wrong? - Uh, nothing, just a feeling. - Hey, hey, hey, it's Acorn's boat! It's moored right there, look. Watch the finger! Right there, right there. - [Prince] Anthony, something really strange is happening. I feel, I feel, like I'm two people at the same time. - What? - I have to go back to that castle. - What, what castle? It's an old ruin that castle, why go there? Let's go on to Acorn's boat. - No! I'm sure my human body is there. (Splash) - Wait! - Oh my god! - Prince come back! Come back! - [Virginia] What is wrong with him? - [Tony] Prince! - Well, we can't go after him. - But... - Let's just go find Acorn and get the mirror back, okay? - Good idea, just let him go, let him go. - Alright, alright. - Faster! Row faster! - I can't row any faster, my hands are bleeding. - My hands are bleeding! - Oh suck an elf, Blue Bell! - Both of you just shut up! - Shut up, look, there's the ruined castle. We should report to the queen. - Excellent idea, steer us over to the shore. - Acorn's been here all morning. He left less than half hour ago. - With the rest of the stuff that was on the boat? - Yep. - When's he coming back? - He's not. He swapped this lovely boat for my horse and carriage, I reckon I got a great deal. - Well which way did he go? - He said he'd use the road through the forest. If you hurry you could catch him. - Good idea, good idea, let's go, let's go! - No, but hold on a second. What about Prince? - He's off, he wants to be on his own. See my heart is breaking, but let's follow the mirror. Ton, you said so yourself, he's been nothing but a nuisance. - Yeah, I know, but I - Look... - it feels a little weird leaving him here, I mean he must have run off for a reason. - You're going to lose that mirror. - Dad - OK, wait wait, fifteen minutes alright, fifteen minutes. - While we're waiting to eat, try to keep your tongue inside your mouth, it's somewhat vulgar to have it hanging out all the time. - I'm starving. Where's my bowl? - You're going to have a lovely meal. - Ooo! - Just as soon as you've learned to use a fork and a knife. Until then you will starve. Would you like something to drink your majesty? - Bowl of water. - No, a glass of water. A prince never drinks from a bowl. - Glass of water, please. - Is there anything else you require? - Uh, my wooly ball. - No, we don't play ball at the table. - Your majesty, the three trolls have returned. - You practice using your fork and knife and I will return to test you in ten minutes. - Fork. Knife. - [Prince] I'm sure I'm here. It must be me. I can smell me. (dog barking) (barking) (dog barking) - You - [Prince] It's me! - You. - [Prince] It's me, I'm you! - It's you. It's me. - [Prince] Yes, yes, good doggy. Good doggy. - Four legs, please? - [Prince] Now, if you can just reach up and touch me we can change back. Oh come on, you dumb dog, reach up! Dammit, I can't reach you. Wait here. You can't hear me, but I'm going to go for help. Now don't worry, I'll be back in just a minute. Don't move! - Where is Prince Wendell? - Ah, yes, Prince Wendell. - I sent you to get him. - A noble mission for any troll. - So where is he? - You idiots! - Ow! - I've spoken with my mirror. Prince Wendell is very near, he may even be in Rivertown by now. - Wow, that's a stroke of luck. - Go and find him! If you return again without the dog, I will make you eat each other's hearts. - Oh, yuck. - Well that didn't go too badly considering. (goats bleating) - Prince? Prince? Prince? - [Prince] Anthony! - Prince! - [Prince] I found myself! - Look out! Look out! (yelling) (yelling) (growling) Leave him alone, alright? (dog barking) He's just a dog, you cowards! - Tony? - Dad? - Tony? Tony? - Hey! - Dad! Oh, thank God you're alright. Did you find Prince? - Uh - Are you okay? - I defeated the trolls. - Oh good. - That's the good news. - Excellent. Is there any bad news, Ton? - Do you think that boatman might have, a chisel? - Dad, what exactly is the bad news? - Well... I think he'll come apart from the others pretty easily. - Hunstman. - You summoned me, my lady. - Neither Wolf nor the trolls have captured the dog yet. Someone is testing me. - Compared to you, they're nothing. - Why can't I see them in my mirrors? Somethings clouding my vision. But, they are near. They have left the river. They're about to enter your forest. - I will find them. Nothing escapes (kiss) The Huntsman. (dramatic music) - Every aspect of my life, I am guided to my highest happiness and fulfillment, every day in every way I am becoming a new and better man. I am sensitive to the needs of women. I am listening to my emotions, and I am one with myself. And... Okay, I am full of peace and serenity, and I have control over all of my desires and, and, Tony! You're ruining the bacon, I can smell it burning! Bacon! - I feel terrible. Look at him! It was a simple magic fish spell gold finger mistake, Tony, It was almost predictable. - But I've killed him. - Oh, things have a way of bouncing back here, I wouldn't worry about him too much. - Really? You're not just saying that? - I'm afraid I am just saying that. - What? - Watch this simple Prince alertness test. Come on, come on! Come on, fetch! Fetch! - That's not funny. - It could get funnier if we keep on doing it. - Why are you two still sitting here? I told you to get packed up. - We're making sandwiches. - We're making sandwiches. - Look, the mirror is getting further away all the time, if we lose this trail now we're never going to get home. - Oh, but Virginia, breakfast is bacon, and nothing sets my nostrils twitching like bacon in the morning. Little pigs parading up and down with their curly corkscrew tails! Ah! Bacon sizzling away on an iron frying pan! Ah! Basted, roasted, toasted, nibble it, chew it, bite right through it, wobble it, gobble it, wrap it round a couple of chickens and am I ravenous! - Let's finish these on the move. - Wait, wait a minute, Virginia. Virginia, wait, Virginia. Virginia, what do you see? - Um, a lot of trees. - No, you see nothing. Look at everything that happened here last night while you slept. - Like what? - You see that clearing? - Yeah. - About midnight, a badger trotted across there. And then two hours later, a mother fox took the path, but our presence spooked her so she went back into the trees. Then a half an hour after that, another fox appeared, male this time, young and out courting, I reckon he got his porridge because I didn't see him come back. Or, or over there. You see over there? Where the undergrowth is disturbed? A noisy little wild boar was snufﬂing about, I can't believe he didn't wake you up. Oh, oh, oh, and right in front of you, you see the passage of the mole, or over there, a stag and a doe watched the sun come up with me, and that's not to mention the all night rabbit party, or the weasels or the pheasants, or that, that owl. And you saw nothing. - I stand corrected. - You most certainly do. - Great can we go? - Oh Tony? (fairy tale music) - I am but poor old lady, spare me some food. - Sorry, we're down to our last six bacon sandwiches. - Good sir - I only give to registered charities. - Young lady? Spare me some food, please? - I'll give you what I have. - Virginia! You're such a soft touch. - Yeah, soft touch. - Hey! - Since you have been kind I have a lesson, for all of you! Take this stick. Break it. And this one. Put these three together. Now, try to break them. - I can't. - That is the lesson. - Good lesson. - Oh wow. I think maybe that was only worth one sandwich. - When the students are ready, the teacher appears. - You didn't go to my school. - Um, excuse me, miss? Did you happen to see a dwarf driving a cart? - Very early this morning, he took the main road through the forest, but you must not. You must leave the path. - Wait! The road's the only safe thing in the whole forest. - Not for you. Someone is following you. They intend to kill you. - Ah - Whoa, wait, what is this intent to kill? - There's a man who controls this forest, The Huntsman. I've heard he serves the queen. But he certainly wouldn't expect us to leave the only road and go into the forest itself. - Why not? - Because only a fool would go into the disenchanted forest. - Well let's not. - Okay, from now on, I will lead. You step where I step. - Wait, I (dramatic music) (haunting winds) (dog barking) (dramatic music) - Is it just me or do you hear moaning? - I hear moaning. - I hear lots of things, the forest is magical. - Oh no - [Virginia] Cripes, what is this place? Do you actually know where we're going? - I'm following my nose. - Who is this huntsman? Ah! (owl hooting) We can't walk all night. - Yes we can. - Whoa, shh. Do you hear something? (horse snorting) (voices) - Gypsies. - What do we do now? - Come! Join us of course. - Poachers. They'll kill us if they so choose. Do not refuse anything they offer, but do not consume anything that you haven't already seen them eat first. - It's like having dinner at your grandmother's house. - I think we should sit down. (accordion music) - This is the best hedgehog I've had in weeks! (clapping) - Now it's your turn, stranger. - Oh, well, no, I don't actually play. - Then sing us a song. - Not a singer. - Tony, sing! Let's not insult our hosts. - I, I can't think of any songs. - Is our hospitality not worth a song? - I don't, I can't. Sure. Um. ♪ Picked up a boy, just south of Mobile ♪ Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal ♪ I was sixteen he was 21 ♪ Gypsies, tramps and thieves ♪ We heard it from the people in the town they called us ♪ Gypsies, tramps and thieves ♪ And every night, the men would come around ♪ And lay their money down - That was good, Dad. - [Tony] Hey, well, I (dramatic music) - Set me free! Set us free! Please, set us free. We're just little victims. - Magic birds. Very rare, very hard to catch. Only the gypsies know how to catch them. - Little victims, you understand that Little victims. - What will happen to them? - They'll have their wings broken, be sold to rich people. - We won't will we? That's awful. - See some people, they eat them, believing that they absorb their magic. - They don't do they? That's terrible. I have six little babies waiting to be fed. They're starving to death without me. - That's awful. Set us free! Please set us free. - Is he real gold? - What? No, no. No, no, no, no, oh please don't. No, no it's just gold paint. I bought a couple, a pair, to put a the end of my driveway. (dramatic music) - Set up a table. (owl calling) I see great wealth coming to you. - Yeah, that's what I like to hear. - And passings, straight through. - That was the, bean I had. And what about the future? - I find The Fool - Uh-huh, and that card? What's that card? - The Fool's friend, the Oaf. He is joined by the Buffoon and the Village Idiot. - Well, uh - I will read the girl. - No thanks. (violin music) - You are full of anger. You conceal much about yourself. I need a lock of your hair. (magical sounds) You have a great destiny which stretches way back in time. - I'm just a waitress so I don't think there's any prizes so far. - You have never forgiven your mother for leaving you. - As I said, I'm not really interested in having my fortune read. - Love and romance, please. Marriage, children, how long is it going to take for the creamy girl of my dreams to say yes, that sort of thing. - I see death. Young girl dead. Torn to pieces. - No! No. See, I was thinking more along the lines of three girls and two boys? - I see a fire being built. - Uh-oh. - You are going to be burned on it. - No! No. - You are not what you seem. You are a wolf. - And so is your grandson. - You must stay with us tonight. Friends must stay together in the dangerous forest. - Yeah. (howling) (birds calling) - Please set us free! - Set us free set us free set us free - Set me free! - Please set us free. (dramatic music) (birds singing) - Set us free! Set us free! - Please set us free! - Set me free! - Please set us free! - Set me free! - Please set us free! - Please set me free! - What the hell is she doing? - Set me free! - Virginia! - Don't don't! - Come on! (crashing) - [Tony] Go, go go, let's get out of here. We gotta go! Go go! - After them! Quick! - Virginia? (dramatic music) (yelling) - Ah! (yelling) - [Fortune Teller] Come back! Come back! - [Wolf] I don't understand, the old woman called off the hunt. - Maybe we just got lucky, okay? Let's just get going, the sooner we get out of this forest the better. Help me get Prince up on the path. - Oh, can't we just bury him? We can always come back sometime in the future. - I'm not going to leave him, alright? I got him into this mess, I'm going to get him out. - [Wolf] (growling) I wish I knew why they gave up so easily. That's not like gypsies at all. (bubbling) - Stretch it, twist it, make it grow Like a river, make it flow, make it pull and pinch and tweak make it grow until she grows weak make her moan and scream and cry make her wish that she would die! (horse neighing) - All poachers will be killed by order of The Huntsman. (hawk calling) He's here! He's here! - He's over there, I saw something move. (screaming) (dramatic music) - What? What are you looking at? - Um, your hair, it looks, well, different. - Oh yeah, that's because I went to the beautician last night. - No, it's not that. It's grown. - Grown? - So it has. - Oh my God. Oh my God, it is longer. That's so weird. What's happening? - The gypsies. Of course they had some of your hair. The gypsies have cursed you! - Cursed me? What do you mean cursed? What am I supposed to do? - Um, braid it? (thunder claps) - [Virginia] Ow, stop it! You're jerking it! - [Wolf] I'm sorry, it's not that easy. You've got a lot of split ends. - [Virginia] Ugh! - [Tony] How long is it now? - [Wolf] Oh, don't ask. - [Tony] Where are we going? (thunder claps) - Ow! - [Tony] Wait, wait wait. - This is crazy, we can't keep going, we've got to stop somewhere. - Well where are we going to find shelter in the middle of the forest? - I don't know (thunder claps) - Look! (thunder claps) - Anyone home? - [Wolf] It's okay, no one's been here for a long time. (thunder claps) - Hey, hey come look at this. (thunder claps) Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - This is Snow White's cottage. Goodness, gracious me, this is the Seven Dwarves' house! It's been lost for a very long time. - Those beds are so tiny. - See this is a great piece of our history. It's a pity Prince is a stiff, this is his grandma's cottage! Gripes! We really shouldn't have a fire if someone's following us. - I don't care, I'm not going to bed with wet hair. - [Wolf] (growling) - You know, here's a question I never thought I'd be asking. What happened to Snow White after she married the prince? - She became a great queen. One of the five women who changed history. - Five women? - Snow White, Cinderella, Queen Riding Hood, Grettel the Great, and the Lady Rapunzel. They formed the first five kingdoms, brought peace to all the lands. But they're all dead now. Some say Cinderella's still alive, but no one's seen her in public in nearly 40 years. She would be nearly 200 years old. The days of "happy ever after" are gone. These are dark times. - [Tony] (yawning) (crickets) (snoring) - [Virginia] What'd you say to that boy in the gypsy camp? - Nothing much, just wolf stuff. - What's wolf stuff? - Oh, I didn't need to say anything to him, I was just with him. He had never seen another wolf and he was scared. It's a lonely path in life to be different, as you know. Where's your mom? - I have no idea. She walked out on us when I was seven. - Sad to be left when you're so little. - I very rarely think about it to be honest with you. She's never really been a part of my life. - What happened? - She just left home. Wouldn't you if you were married to my dad? They're just totally different people. You've met my grandmother, right? My mother was like that. It was a complete mismatch, they never should have gotten married to begin with. Anyway, it was a long time ago. - Well where is she now? - I haven't a clue. And I couldn't care less, really. - Don't you wonder what she's like? - She could have gotten back in touch with me, but she didn't. And that's fine, you know, I mean she doesn't want me, I'm not going to waste my energy thinking about her. - Oh. - Oh what? - Oh. Just oh. Oh. As in, an encouraging, noncommittal noise. Try not to comment as you listen, as my very good self-help books tell me. (sneezing) You must do something magnificent with your life. - Oh yeah? Why? - Because your hurt is very great. - They just split up okay? God! Doesn't that ever happen where you come from? - Of course not. We either live happily ever after, or we get killed by horrible curses. You don't trust nobody. - I don't trust you, no. - Well, you may not get hurt, but huff puff, you won't get loved either. (birds singing) - My God. Oh my God! - What? What? Goodness me! Cripes! - It's everywhere! What am I going to do? - [Wolf] Tony? Tony? Virginia, it's... - [Virginia] It's growing up the stairs! - You know what, it's no good. Nothing cuts through this. - Well what if it never stops growing? I'm going to die of long hair! - No, no - [Bird] Don't despair. Because you saved my life, I will tell you how to cut your hair. - Oh please! - Deep in the forest there is a Woodsman with a magic ax, that when swung, never fails to cut whatever it hits. And it will cut your hair and kill the curse. - Okay, we better get moving before Virginia's hair gets too long. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, these apples look good though, huh? - No Tony! No, what are you doing? Don't eat that apple! - Hey, hey, hey, why not? - Think about where you are, Snow White's cottage. - Yeah? - That apple tree has probably grown from the pips of the apple that poisoned her! - Ugh, is nothing safe around this crazy place? - Come along, we have much to do if we're going to keep up with the mirror. - Okay, you got the hair, I got the dog. (suspenseful music) Just be careful, you got this trip here, - No kidding? It's tripping. - You know, I didn't curse you. - Oh, oh, oh, I got a scent. I'm sure it's The Huntsman, he's near. We must move faster. - Hello? I can't go any faster! - Virginia this man is going to catch us within an hour - Alright, alright alright what are we going to do? - I'll hide you. This Hunstman is very good, but he follows tracks he cannot smell things like an animal. I lead him in a big circle and then come back for you tomorrow. - What? - Now hurry! Let's start with Prince. That's the best I can do. Are you okay? Now, don't breathe. Okay. Don't breathe at all until I return, okay? Okay, good. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (sneezing) - Virginia get out, come on run run! Hurry, follow me! Run! Run! Virginia! - Ow! (dramatic music) - Virginia? Virginia? - Ow! Stop it, you're hurting me! Let go! Let go of me right now! Ow! - Ah! - What happened? - He's got Virginia, that's what happened. - No! - Yes. - We'll never find her! - What? - It's all my fault. Oh, it's all my fault!
