Hakutei high... YAMAMOTO Toru. Toshio Mizutani. Nakamura Shigeru. Whore... You're right. Who are you? Are you the principal? No. Follow me. Miss Mejika Saeko? The rumor has it you turned down a place in a top high-school as you preferred teaching in our school. Why was that? I admire your high-school's principles. Thank you very much. You'll work three days a week. Thank you. Your attention, please! I introduce you to Miss Mejika Saeko who'll be our biology teacher. - Welcome. - Thank you. For today it's alright, but... Tomorrow come dressed properly. I'll take you to the classroom. Please. 'Mejika Saeko" I'll leave you to it. Stand up! Salute! I'll take the roll call. - Aoyama. - Here. Akagi. Akagi Reiichi. He's name's Ryoichi. He's absent. Thank you. - Akiyama. - Here. - Kurosu. - Here. Kuroda. Sakata. SATO. Shimazaki. I am Akagi Ryoichi. Here. Shibata. Nakamura. Mizutani. YAMAMOTO. Yokoyama. Wakabayashi. Wada. Teacher! Give us our IDs back. What's your problem? This high-school's objective is to turn out the country's future elite. You, you're only a bunch a losers, only good at funding this high-school with your school taxes. Your only aim will be to be accepted in a top university. As you know it, our high-school has had the best acceptance percentage for the last three years. We owe this to your elders who have toiled hard. It also is due to the work of your teachers here present. You must be proud about if and consider yourselves privileged. The key to success is in your hands. There's something else I must tell you. Put away any inkling of individualism. Only perseverance will help you win the exams war. I'm frozen down to my uterus. Making us sit through such a boring speech... It was of a ridiculous moralism. There is such a thing as a body's thinking. Miss Mejika! Please. Look. The principal has kept his students in the cold. And every morning, after his speech, he imposes upon himself the same suffering. He's as tough with himself, as he is with the others. He'd put his life down in defending the honor of this school. It's cold. Let's close the window. - Good morning. - Good morning. The key to that phrase is "that". Has everyone understood? Then, I'll move on. "The deceased Emperor's concubine withdrew in a far-away Chinese province. " The most important muscle for locomotion is the quadriceps. This muscle is situated between the gluteal muscle and the tibiofemoral space. This is the quadriceps. And this is the gluteal muscle. Teacher.. I'm listening. If we wanted to see a striptease, we'd go to the cabaret. What else? Teachers should stimulate the students with their strictness. But you, you aren't making any effort. Learn to control yourself. Is that all? On the tangent, points A and B. By substituting A, we obtain a curve. So, that's what you understand by teaching? Do you always... expose yourself like this? When one's imagination is unhealthy, it knows no bounds. That's enough. You're going too far. Mr. Mizoguchi, don't be violent. Leave me alone. It seems biology deals with living bodies. Do you condone Miss Mejika's attitude? No, not at all. Ryoichi. Let's go. As you already are 20 years old, I won't meddle into your life. Eat. If I put you in my place, it's because your parents have asked me to. To make a good Japanese out of you. I must help you enroll the best state university. That's an obsession! It demotivates me. An American coffee. No, an expresso. - An expresso. - Very well. I'll stay in the high-school. Why? Because Miss Mejika is in love with me. With you? Keep him away from physical effort. And a healthy diet. He shouldn't drink any alcohol. And, also, no stress. It's the first time I've seen my father in this condition. The doctor had forbidden me to let you know. Show the nurse out. Very well. Tell me... Do you believe in the future? Me, in the future, what could I hope for? And today? The only thing I know, it's that I'll be old. I'll have crow's-feet... My lips will whiten. So, let's drink to the future retirement. Cheers! Cheers! Another one. Stop! Allow me. No! You're exciting me! Let's see you now... Come. No... No, not like this. You're a real sex beast. It's still hard. Suck it. No. No! No! Are you bonkers, or what? You'll dirty my sheets. Stop it! It's disgusting! Go. Get lost! Why? You're just a dirty pig. You've dirtied my favorite sheets. I don't want to see you anymore. Get out of here. Was I good? Yes. But now, leave. "Miss Mejika. We'd rather study without you. " 'Leave us alone. " What can I do for you? "Miss Mejika. We'd rather study without you. " 'Leave us alone. " I also would rather study without them. Wait! I'm warning you. The students reject you because they don't suit them. Do you understand? No. Come in. Miss Asano has been missing for two days. Two days? - Without leave? - Yes. You should have told me yesterday! Did you go to see her? No, not yet. It's in here. It really is a single woman's apartment. It's clean. It doesn't have anything out of the ordinary. - It's odd. - It really is. What do you find odd? Don't you see? She's been missing for two days, and she isn't at home. But... ...it'll be difficult finding a replacement for her. She isn't irreplaceable, far from it. What's odd, is that this apartment is too tidied up. Then... I don't want to believe it. "Hakutei High-school. " What?! Our students? What? A teacher took part in the rape? It seems a young girl was raped by a couple of our students. Yesterday afternoon, she called the principal, but I took the call. Come down to it. Here are the names of the students: Nakamura Shigeru, YAMAMOTO Toru, and Mizutani Toshio. Let's hear now Mr. Ichimura. I've questioned them today. They admitted to having a relation with that girl. But, they say it was consensual. So, it isn't rape. Who was that girl? Her name is Hayakawa Rumi. She's in a Kawada high. Did you meet her? No, not yet. - Your turn. - We must talk about... Goon. The girl said a teacher took part in the rape. What's all that about? Well... It's so unthinkable and contrary to our principles... ...that I thought it was a lie. The girl says a teacher took part in the rape. But she won't lay charges if we fire her. That's what she told me. She pretends it's someone in our high-school? Yes. Principal, sir, that's not where the problem lies. A teacher, a woman moreover, couldn't be guilty of such a crime. Yes, it is quite possible. Miss, explain us why is that. In the case of Miss Mejika, it's possible. Yesterday I went to Miss Asano. If I did go, it was to question her about the reason for her being an absentee. But, there were no signs of life in her apartment. It's there that I found this envelope. When you'll have opened it, you'll understand what I am trying to tell you. Look. What is this? Miss Mejika. I'm not interested in your private life. But you have to give us the proof of your innocence. I'm waiting for explanations. It's true I was there when that high-school girl was raped. Here are the IDs of the three boys. I found them there. You! But what exactly are your intentions? Shut up. I'm listening. I've told the truth and have nothing else to add. That's enough! We must think about a punishment. Leave this room. Are you telling me to go to the police? Students in a reputable high-school committed a rape. What's more, a teacher in this high-school took part in the rape. What do you intend to do? The rape is one month old. You hadn't officially joined us yet. Principal, sir. This rape has nothing to do with our institution. If we report it to the police, we'll have to answer before the parents and the media. I detest those that go along with a wait-and-see policy. Our problem, it's the losers we have here. Isn't it so, principal? Miss, You're talking without thinking. And these photos, you should've told me earlier about them. Having disclosed them in here is a professional mistake! Go back to your place. I'll be the one to think about an adequate sanction. And some of you will have to follow me to the very end to save the school's honor. Severity is the only thing that can guarantee our integrity. The meeting is over. No, not yet. "15th of September. "30,000 yen, "with a civil servant. "Preliminaries: 6/20. "'Sexual act: 14/20. "Post-sexual tenderness: 0/20. Clinging customer. "17th of September, 23,000 yen, with a draughtsman. "Preliminaries: 16/20. Sexual act: 2/20. "Premature ejaculation. 18th of September... â€œ Enough! That's Miss Asano's. You mean... Miss Asano... Yes, she's prostituting herself. This one. Is it that difficult, getting rid of a teacher? Namishima? The president, speaking. Yes, Mejika Saeko... Check her up. It's difficult to explain. Give me some time. Very well. Come back at the end of the day. I don't want you to leave. I want to help you. Thank you. In this high-school, I'm the one the president... ...trusts most. More than his son, the principal. Let's talk about this tonight. The diary is not there. I look like a spy, don't I? Do you work for the president? Or is it... for the principal? What do you think? Tonight, it's a sleepless night. You shouldn't... Why not? I'm not afraid of a... ...scandal with you. Of course, "Hakutei" is an important high-school. But, there are others. The president and the principal are resting in their villa. I want to see them. It's possible. When? On Sunday. It'll be too late. Saturday. Friday, I've got classes. Still no news from Miss Asano? Above all, hide very well the photos. I've ordered Mejika brought here. Replace me at tomorrow's meeting. - Understood. - Wait. It's Namishima. The media isn't aware of anything. Don't be afraid. See you on Saturday. Why didn't you help that girl? Do you know about the rape? Miss, answer my question. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. It doesn't matter. Akagi, follow us! Turn! Hurry! Hi. Good afternoon, teacher. Miss. I've got a question. I'm listening, YAMAMOTO. Is that you... ...that ratted on us? Not at all. It's that girl. Stop your bullshit. What a funny situation! The rapists together with their victim who has turned them in. She's talking nonsense. If I had gave them up, I wouldn't be with them. Still, it's unbelievable. A high-school teacher... ...taking part in a rape... Tell me, Akagi. How much did your car cost? I don't know. Around 5,000,000. Mine, I've bought it second-hand. If smash it, your principal will cry. - Come. - What? My cap... Here it is. Does this relieve you? No. You shouldn't have run away without asking me for help. You wanted to replace me? Are you kidding or what? Let's go, miss. I was playing football in high-school, in New York. I..- ...like sportsmen. Jimmy will be pleased, if I call him. Jimmy? Ryoichi... Are you seeing someone? Yes. What kind of a girl is she/? Madam, do you see the white house? It's there. Please. - Sir. - I was waiting for you to call. I'm sorry. - Where's she? - She's waiting at the entrance. Stop. I didn't know you were Edmond's daughter. Edmond? Do you remember your father? No. I was only two years old when he died. Oh, yes. He died a painful death. There are lots of photos here of your father and I when we founded "Hakutei" high-school. - Do you want to see them? - No. Let's not waste any time. What is it exactly that you want? Money? - I'm Edmond's daughter. -So? I can't bring myself to believe... ...you're his daughter. Thanks for coming. Ryoichi. - Have you eaten on the road? - No. - Go talk to the cook. - Very well. Leave me alone with her. I'd rather the president stays. If that's what you want. So, you are the high-school's founder's daughter? Why haven't you said anything? The reason, the president must know it. What is she talking about? Principal, sir... Do you remember what happened 21 years ago? 21 years ago? Back then, you were studying in the United States. That's true. And what happened in Japan? Edmond was murdered. I can't follow you. Your father, the president, is the murderer. Miss Edmond's daughter, can I offer you a coffee? While it's hot. You've recruited a Fury. She's blackmailing you. You've got yourself in a hell of a fix. But, what are you trying to do? You should reason with the president. I'll give you everything I've got. Give me 'Asano's diary. If it were discovered, it'd mean the high-school's end, but yours also. - I don't have it with me. - What?! Dinner's ready. Serve it in here. Have something with us. No, thank you. Mejika, sell us the diary. How much do you want for it? I want the high-school. It's legit for a daughter to demand what was her father's. I advise you to go and see a shrink. Rather, it's you who should go. Turn it down! Do you think it's possible? But of course. You'll resign during the next board meeting. And you'll appoint me as your successor. Kid stuff. Hello? Hello, it's Jimmy. Don't hang up. It's for you, from the United States. Ryoichi speaking. Hi, Ryoichi. - Fine, and you? - I'm also fine. I'm missing you. Here. You're hurting me. So clumsy. My friend is better endowed. What do you mean? Take me from behind. Quickly. You're not too bright. I wanted to avoid a scandal, at any costs. Because I know my interests. But I'd rather face a scandal than turn the high-school to you. A call from the high-school. - Who from? - Mr. Namishima. I'll take it. I wanted to talk to you. Kashiwagi speaking. I'd like to give Jimmy a present. - Any idea? - Stop seeing that boy. It'll be the last time. - Go look in the closet. - Thank you. I suggest we bury the hatchet. I understood the diary you have... ...Is a weapon capable of destroying my high-school and my family. As for your proposition, allow me a couple of days to think about it. Have you changed your mind all of a sudden? Yes, maybe. I want to think about it calmly. Very well. Show our guest to her room. Follow me. Good night. - You can go home. - Thank you. The high-school has just informed us... ...that miss Asano has been found naked and strangled. You've got it very well. If it's discovered that her death is related to prostitution, our high-school will never recover. I won't be able to get out of this on my own. You must get the diary from Mejika, without any delay! Whatever happens, we must keep the high-school. Let's defend our reputation and safeguard our fortune. Do you understand? I've chosen this trunk. Help me. "Narcotic" - Thank you. - Don't mention it. - Drink this. - Thank you. It's bitter. Not at all. Miss! Miss! Thank you, you saved me. Who did this? Where's the principal? He went out. Miss... Have something hot. I've killed the principal. What?! I put his body in the trunk and threw it into the sea. The sea? My son! His feet! I'm going. - Good day. - Good day. - Today it's useless. - But... I wasn't informed. The president went to the high-school for some urgent business. Oh, well... Thank you for keeping me briefed. Are you angry? - Because of her? - No. I'm not angry. It's your fault. Why? You are too hesitant with me. It's only normal. We are not that much in love. Kiss me. You don't want it, it seems. It's not that, but I'm not sure of myself. Now you're saying it?! What have you bought? I'm hungry. This again? I know, but it's handy. There's nothing to cook. Father. We were waiting for you. No! Don't touch her. You... You can leave. The diary is worthless now. With Asano's death, everything's in the open. Go away! I must save my high-school. There's no point. I'm the one who must do it. Not a murderer's son. That's ridiculous. It's you made me understand... ...how my father was killed. I understood it when I was in the trunk. Ryoichi. Bring the trunk. When I provoked the president by throwing water on him, he jumped on me to kill me. And just then, the view of this harmless trunk... ...made him lose his means. Why was that? Son, the trunk! Not the trunk. No! I surely am a murderer's son. But you'll never have my high-school. You won't defeat me. It's outright war. "Go "Hakutei high! "Go "Hakutei high!" One, two... one, two... THE END
