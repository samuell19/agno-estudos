Toei Company, LTD. ~ Narazu-mono ~ AN OUTLAW Who are you? You bastard! Follow that car now! Planned by SEKI Masajiro, KATAGIRI Jo Written by ISHII Teruo Cast TAKAKURA Ken TAN BA Tetsuro SUGIURA Naoki EHARA Shinjiro KAGA Mariko MIHARA Yoko, MINAMIDA Yoko You said you have a wife and kid. Then, don't remember my face. Directed by ISHII Teruo Do you understand? Hey, I don't like getting in bed during the day. Just give me the stuff that you're supposed to. Hey, I don't have much time. Hey... She's dead. Why is she in my room? I see, instead of payment, they left me this girl's body. I should get out of here right away. Give me a Rower. Thank you. I missed it again. It's impossible to hit the middle of the circle. I'll try again. Close! No good! You won! Thank you. It looks like you don't need them. If you wish, I'll buy the prizes and pay you in cash. No, thank you. Do you have many girlfriends to give the presents to? Sure. Can I be one of them? Maybe, she would be the perfect woman to run away with. What are you thinking of? I can give them to you. Realm But it depends on the situation. What do you mean? I'm happy to have dinner with a lady as beautiful as you. Also, it would be wonderful if you could drop me off at Kaitak Airport. Please come to Kowloon Side Rose Apartment. Everything is this flower's fault. She was looking for a man wearing a yellow flower. Then, what do these prizes mean? I knew they weren't just prizes. Give me some steamed dumplings. Thank you. Do you speak Japanese? I have a Japanese lady friend. Does this restaurant have a hotel, too? Can I stay one night? I'll ask the madam. What does he look like? He doesn't look like a person who usually stays at this kind of hotel. In this area, this is a first-class hotel. Take him to the room, Plum Orchard. Take the money in advance, it'll be fifteen yuan. I will. Thank you. I'll give you all of them. It's free. Thank you. Can you keep this in your room? Sure. This is very precious. Please don't let anybody see this. Nobody comes to my room. It's a storage room. Thank you. Aki, are you okay? Thank you. I'm useless. That man was going to stay over, but left. But it's not his fault. He paid for pleasure, not for a sick woman. In my country, they say a broken mirror brings bad luck. It's just a superstition. We have many in China, too. I hope so. You can have it. It's pretty. I don't need this because I don't use makeup. This will be your keepsake. What do you mean? Maybe, I will go to Macau. Macau. Why? Please don't make such a sad face. I'll make a lot of money and come back here. Do you have to go? I don't want to. DISCIPLINARY OFFICER MURDERED NEAR KOWLOON STATION DAUGHTER ALSO FOUND STRANGLED TO DEATH I didn't know the man I killed was the Disciplinary Officer. I was waiting for you. Were you waiting for me or the prizes? If I said I was waiting for you, it wouldn't be true. I should say, 'both'. By the way, who are those guys? They are your bodyguards. I hope so. You'll soon see if it's true or not. Now we are all alone. What shall we do next? Come with me. There is only one thing to do when a man and a woman are in a locked room. Wait a second. I don't like a spring chair. You're funny. When I see a woman lying down on the bed during the daytime, a rash breaks out on my body. I'm sorry. Don't you like me? Yes, I like and trust you. But before that, we need to talk. What do you want me to do? It's easy. I want your guys to investigate something for me. I'm listening. I drank two glasses of milk for breakfast. I want to see your boss, not you. If I say, no? You'll never get the stuff I'm holding. And, you'll lose a good drug distribution point. Will you give me some time? I don't have much time. I'll come to see you here again. Then, please come to Statue Square. I don't like men to come to my room all the time. Everything is okay. Can I see your boss? Where are we going? We're going to the quietest place in Hong Kong. I've brought Mr. Nanjo. I'm Chiang. I'm Nanjo. Have a seat. How can I help you? Yesterday, a man called Chin was shot to death in front of the Star Ferry. I read the newspaper. I want to know who benefited from the death of Mr. Chin. Can I ask you one question? Sure. Why are you looking for that person? The man I was asked to kill was supposed to be the biggest thug in the underworld. However, it turned out that he was an innocent man. After the lob, the woman who prepared my passport should have been at the hotel. I was told, until I escaped safely, I could use her for my convenience. That was my agreement. When I returned to the hotel, I found the woman's dead body instead. The woman was the daughter of the Disciplinary Officer, and the man I killed was her father. You were very well taken care of. I must express my appreciation. I see. As soon as I complete the investigation, I'll tell you, and you bring me the drugs. No problem. How can I contact you? You can contact me at my apartment. It shows you have good luck. We'll exchange the things while we are both present. Perfect. Victoria Peak is the highest place in Hong Kong. You can oversee Hong Kong island and Kowloon Peninsula. Do you have a job? It's a big one. How big? At least five million. Five million? It must be risky. If you fail, you'll be in trouble. But it's an easy job. Do you want to do it? I'll think about it after you've told me the details. That's okay, then. Be patient, I'm lust trying to irritate you. Irritate me? That's my line. Don't be mad. I have a habit of acting superior. It's a bad habit. That's why... I know I'll never be successful. So, we need to trade the prizes for the information he wants, because the drugs were given to him by mistake. Even when you obtain the drugs, if you sell them, your boss will find them immediately. When a lady comes to your room, do you always show her such a dangerous thing? When a lady visits someone, she knocks on the door. I like the other way. It's too shocking for me. What about the matter? We got all the information you want. Can I have what we want? Your boss said he would be present when I give it to you. He is out of town. Anyway, I'll give you this information right now. Right now? Why? Because I trust you, and you should hurry up or the man you're looking for might go away. Mao Tao, Basement of Kowloon Castle... He is a pharmacist. I want to see Mr. Mao. Are you looking for stimulants? I know you speak Japanese. He said he had a job for me, so I came from Xiamen. Sorry to tell you this but the job was already taken. I need to see him. That's your fault because you were late. You weren't the only applicant. I want to see Mr. Mao anyway. Where does he live? Do you hear me? Let go of me. Take me to Mao's place or I'll cut off your head like this snake. He is not in town. He left for Yokohama in Japan. Can I believe you? It's true. I got the airplane ticket for him. Then, you should get an airplane ticket and a passport for me. Why didn't he give you the drugs when he got the information? He wanted to know if the information was true. He was supposed to talk with my boss. We'll be terminated if he tries to give the drugs to your boss. He doesn't have time for that. If I hadn't given him the information, everything would have been over. Why don't we enjoy this game? If your boss knows about this, he will kill us. It's a big gamble. All or nothing. That is the thrill of gambling. Maybe it's too difficult for a kid to understand. What did you say? The telephone is ringing. Hello, this is Minran. It's you, Mr. Nanjo. Did the information help you? Thank you. But I don't have time to give it to you. What? Don't worry. I don't lend anything to anyone or borrow anything from anyone. Hold on. Hey, can you finish the job? I'm relying on you. Hello Shoko, the girl working at the hotel, has the drugs. Okay, I'll go and get it right now. Walt, she doesn't know what it is, and I don't want to bother her. For her sake, you should pay for the room in the hotel. I see. I'll stay there and go to her room at night. That's right. The girl sleeps in the storage room on the third floor. She will open the door if you give the secret knock. Please listen carefully. Don't be scared. Mr. Nanjo sent us to you. We need the thing that you got from him. I don't know. I don't have anything. Give it to us. Somebody help! Help! Be quiet. Maybe it's inside the ceiling. Here it is. What is this fuss about? This is a first-class hotel, I don't want any trouble. We just came to get the item she was keeping for us. You scared her in the middle of the night. It looks like this must be very important. Mr. Nanjo tried to call her many times, but he couldn't talk to her. Then, you purposely stayed in this hotel and came to get it in the middle of the night. We can discuss it tomorrow. What are you doing? What are you going to do? I'll call for somebody. Tonight, this hotel is full. If you do that, it may damage the reputation of this hotel. Why don't you accept this? That's not enough to keep me quiet. What? I know how much it is worth. Then, how much do you want? One hundred thousand yuan. Are you serious? I'm sure it's worth it to you to pay that much, including the girl's funeral. Funeral? You've caused me trouble. I wasn't going to kill her. It was an accident. This will give you more than you want. Instead, you have to take care of this. This is a first-class hotel. Customers' trust is most important. Ladles and gentlemen, thank you for joining us tonight. In today's special show, we will be entertained by Mr. Flyboy. Thank you. Since I just came to Japan, I'm not good at speaking Japanese. I'll mime. Hello, this is Mari. The guy with the beard likes me a lot. Of course, tonight... I have a question for you. What is it? About the foreigner with you. Are you from the police? Can I show you my iD? No, thank you, but you don't look like a detective. What makes you say that? You look stylish. Thank you. Nowadays, detectives are casual. But this hotel has bad taste. I won't ask you anything that requires you to look at yourself in the mirror. Just answer my questions. No problem. It's much better than the detective's room. The foreigner was... I know you don't know anything. Your agent contacted you, so you were doing your job as usual. Then, what do you want to know? I want to know about the guys who you are working for. Where is their office? We shouldn't waste our time. You're not a detective, are you? Do you feel better now? No, it's the opposite. I just met him in town and went dancing. I'm not committing any crime. Don't give me a hard time, just answer my question. I can tell you, but you'll have to protect me afterwards. My friend suddenly disappeared from Yokohama after talking too much. Was she killed? The boss is not that simple. It's his policy to use us as long as we are making money. People say she was sent to Hong Kong or Macau. I hear it is terrible there. The girls are forced to use drugs. When they become useless, they are abandoned like an old rag. Do they have connections there, too? I don't know about that, but I hear they come from there to buy girls. Because Japanese girls are popular with foreigners. It looks like that. The foreign guy seemed crazy about you. I'm not stupid. It takes more than that to make me happy. I've already saved a lot of money. I'm thinking of leaving here and starting a small business in the country. I can help you, depending on your story. I'll make sure you can leave this town safely. Is that all? It'll be up to me whether you are sent to Hong Kong or Macau. Or open a small restaurant in the countryside. You can make up your own mind. Our boss is the general manager of Club Riviera. Club Riviera? I want that girl in the red dress. Many foreign guys would like her. She will be very expensive. Please don't be mean to me. Your selection is excellent. All of the girls make good money. There are ten girls, like Yuriko, Chigusa, Akemi and Sayuri. I see. They are making good money. I'll pay five million yen. Please send them this month. The dog race will be held at the end of this month. Many rich guys will come. Now, I'm meeting my client. We have a problem. Then, I'm leaving. Goodbye. Goodbye. What happened? It seems Mari has betrayed us. She got this foreign guy at the harbour. He was so mad. He said the girl ran away. How much was his contract? It was 10,000 yen. Take another girl and apologize to him. The profit from your area is not bad. I don't like a bad reputation. I understand. What are we going to do with Mari? That's not your business. Mari ran away. Call all the guys available and get her before she gets far. Who are you? I don't need much time but I need to talk to you. Are you the general manager? How can I help you? I have a question for you. Would you like a drink? The general manager likes to treat clients well. Don't waste your time doing that. If you give drinks nobody orders, you will lose a lot of customers. By the way, do you have a client called Mao from Hong Kong? We'll send ten girls to Hong Kong soon. If you follow those girls, you will reach him. Thank you. You're welcome. Maybe, I'll see you again. We still have time until the ship to Macau departs, I'll show you the beautiful scenery in Hong Kong. The girl was murdered. Who did it and why? Damn it! I like your hotel, so I came back. I'll have you taken to the room. Wait a second. I want you to take me to the room. I'm a first-class guest. Hurry up! My gun is ready in my pocket. Be patient. What are you going to do? I'm an old woman. You've lived long enough. There was a poor girl who was killed in her youth. It wasn't my fault. I don't know anything. Let me go. Can't breathe. Tell me. Who killed Shoko? I didn't. The young guy who came with the woman. Why were you watching her being killed? Help me. I know you got paid. Where was she killed? Here? You're making a risky bet. Anything wrong? In a sense, you're either a real pro, or a complete amateur. Which do you think I am? I think you're the latter. Why do you think so? At fifteen, I started working at the gambling house. For twenty years, I've lived in this world. I have a lot of experience in Monaco, Mar del Plata, Las Vegas and Reno. I know most of the famous gamblers. Do you mean you don't know me? Also, you bet but don't intend to win. You're just absorbed in gambling. That scares me. Luck is coming your way. Then, I'll try to bet until this gambling house goes bankrupt. You don't care about money. What do you want? Can you sell it, if I want to buy? How much will you pay? All the money I won. I'll sell it then, if you call it a day and leave. Ten Japanese girls came here last night. Do you want those girls? I want to see the guy who manages them. Do you mean the man who makes the girls take money from the big winners here? If that what you want, I don't need any money from you. Mao has an office at Shingo Liquor Shop on Coat Avenue. Why did you give me free information? Well, maybe I don't like men who exploit girls for profit. But please don't tell anyone that you got the information from me. It may cause me trouble. I appreciate your kindness. See you again in Las Vegas or somewhere. I needed to see you sooner or later. It's too late to make excuses any more. Get lost. Well, you'll see. You're very strong. I'll let you live until next time. You killed the young girl. You don't deserve to be called the boss. Did I kill the girl? You must be insane. She stole the drugs. What are you talking about? I told Minran to get the drugs from the girl at the hotel. It was my mistake that I didn't contact the girl. Because she didn't know anything, she didn't give them to you. However, you had no reason to kill her. I'll never forgive you for that. Wait. Did you say you talked to Minran? Don't pretend you didn't know anything. It seems we're the ones who were deceived. Minran sent me lust one letter from Kowloon Station. She said you kidnapped her while she was watching you. All of my guys were looking for you but they couldn't find you. I was in Japan. I heard Minran was seen in Macau. Then, I came here on business. I'll use any means to find that woman. I'll take care of her. I almost know where she is. I hope you'll be successful with your business. Let's meet at 4:00 tomorrow anyway. Ask Mr. Tao at Shingo Liquor Shop if he wants to buy drugs at a reasonable price. It'll be 1.5 million yuan per pound. That greedy man must be interested. That's her apartment. Long time no see. Boss, he saved me. Last night, he helped me escape from Mr. Nanjo. I see. Thank you very much for taking care of Minran. I'll pay you for that. Please listen to me. I have many things to tell you. You and he had a good time, too. You misunderstood. I just met Mr. Nanjo. You said he kidnapped you. He told me everything. Pardon me. He threatened me. Don't lie. Speak in Chinese. Shut up, crook! Damn you! Crook. What are you saying? You deceived me... Please believe me. I can face Mr. Nanjo. I don't like your angry face. I believe you... Are you sure? Do you believe me? I always believed you... You still believe me, right? I feel remorse for what I did. I felt sad as soon as I'd left you. I need a man like you. It's been a long time since we've been together. That's right. We're all alone. Take off your clothes. Everything is the same as before. You and I... I believe you... I'm happy to hear that. I believe... you lie to me all the time. Good to see you again. Are you a friend of the club manager in Yokohama? I'm not going to bother your business any more. Stop following me. You misunderstood. I'm here because of my business. I see, you're right. He must be a detective. Everything will be over if I get caught now. I have to get away from him. Are you okay? I can't breathe. I lost. Shoot me, if you want to. She will die if we leave her like this. Should we call for a doctor? Even a doctor can't save her, because blood is accumulating in the throat. Do you mean she would be able to breathe if the blood wasn't there? Yes, but doctors don't have the necessary tool. Somebody should suck the blood from her throat. Hey, do you still have something to do with me? I need to find evidence that the guys buy and sell these ladies. I see... You're a disciplinary officer. I was mistaken. Since I'm not in Japan now, whatever you did, I have no right to arrest you. I'm glad you remember that. But I informed the Macau Police that you're suspected of murdering the old lady in Kowloon. They are desperately looking for you. The police have cordoned off many parts of town. Don't waste your time hanging around tonight. You will be very lucky if you can survive until tomorrow morning. After tomorrow, the police won't have time for you any more, because the dog race will be held here. A hundred thousand people will visit from Hong Kong and Kowloon. It will keep their hands full. But, I'm sure, somewhere in the town, you'll be caught by their cordon. See you then. Where are you going? I'm going to work. Why do you ask? No reason, but will you be okay? I must work. Stay here, or you'll kill yourself. Then, can you buy me? Hey, I know you feel uncomfortable, but I won't beg for your money. Don't you want to owe me anything? I already owe you too much. You don't owe me anything. You know I'm a murder suspect yet you let me stay in your room. We're even. I wish I were in Japan. I want to go home. It sounds odd, but I want to die in Japan. You can go to Japan soon. Bad things won't continue forever. I was deceived by many guys. I don't trust anyone any more. I think I understand you very well. My mother gave birth to me in prison. My father ran away with a young girl after he made my mother pregnant. My mother stabbed that big liar in the stomach. My mother always told me, 'do anything you want, but don't deceive anyone'. After leaving the reformatory, I lived in the underground. But I've never deceived anybody. That's why you're a great person. Well... I guess, before I was born, I grew in a good environment. You're unlucky. If you'd met me a long time ago, you would have fallen in love with me. Then, I would have a different life, too. Thank you. What's wrong? You look fierce. Nothing. You're lucky not to have met me earlier. I'm an outlaw who can't live without this kind of accessory. I make anyone who comes close to me unhappy. It won't happen to me, because my life couldn't be any worse. Walt for me at the harbour where the boats leave for Hong Kong between 5:00 and 6:00 tomorrow evening. I'll take you to Japan. Your bad luck may end. If we can't meet tomorrow, come at the same time and place the day after tomorrow. You may be deceived once again, but try and come. Mao is lucky to live one day longer. I read the newspaper this morning. Is it okay for you to hang around here? I can't do anything anyway because this is a small island surrounded by the ocean. What will you do? You'd better worry about yourself. I have an appointment with Mao at 5:00 in room C-8 of the Seaside Hotel. If you go there instead of me, you can see him, as you wish. Thank you very much. Good luck. You said thank you to me, but I'll get you into trouble. Pretend not lo know about them and just walk slowly. We're surrounded. They can't do anything here. They are smart enough to know we have guns. I guess so, because we are in the middle of town. When we get to the comer over there, start running and tum left. We we've gone 50 meters, the street will fork into two. Tum left and keep going left, you'll reach the slum. Once you get there, you'll be safe. I'll follow you anyway. No, I'll go to the right. Why? If both of us are caught, you can't go to see Mao in time. Although I'm not familiar with this area, If you keep going right, I can tell you reach only the ocean. If I'm lucky, I'll find the way. If I'm not, I'll give up. Are you going to take a hopeless gamble, to let me escape? Don't worry. This is what I'm happy to do... it's not for you. I accomplished everything I wanted in my life. I shot Minran yesterday. When I saw her dead body, I started to think I'd had enough of living. Did you love her? I don't know. Maybe I did. But everything was over. Let's go! Wait! Go now. If we both get caught, only Mao will be happy. I don't like that only I'll be safe. Hurry up! Go away. Are you going to die for nothing? Okay, I'll go. Give me money. I have no more. This is all. I enjoyed myself. It was a good attraction. Let's take a walk. I don't owe you anything. I'm happy to meet my compatriot. The Portuguese Police are watching the Haupen Ma Lo area. If you go to Len An Hochi, no police will be there yet. When I finish my business, I hope I can see you again, in your territory. You're punctual. It's 5:00 sharp. You really like things correct. You took too long. Leave it to me, Boss. Good night. Wait. Damn you! Wait. Everybody makes mistakes. I can explain it to you. Let's talk. I can do anything you want. Of course, I'll let you do it, until I am happy. Stop showing it. I was looking for you to correct this big mistake. Stop using tricks. You can't deceive me anymore. I'm not a gentleman like you. I can't lie or deceive anybody. You pretend to run a company, however, you are engaged in prostitution. You get women addicted to drugs, so they can't run away. I can't be that clever. I can give you $30,000. I said "$30,000". $30,000? It's just small money to you. Then I'll give you one million or how about ten million? Please forget everything. I'll let you go anywhere you want to. Las Vegas, Rio de Janeiro, Monaco... Everybody, like hotel managers, presidents and ladies... will give you special treatment. You can own everything... like liquor, bright sun and beautiful ladies. Shut up. It was a big mistake thinking money can buy anything in the world. You can't save your life with money. We're both villains, but we're different. You deceived me and I killed that innocent officer. How much did you make doing that? Also, you left the woman's dead body for me. That's your way. You take everything from them and throw them away like an old rag. These bullets that are going into your fat ugly body, have grudges, hatred and tears of many people. You can't feel them from just one shot. Feel the pain. Die with a lot of pain. Are you okay? That lady... Hey... The End Subtitled by Marukomu
