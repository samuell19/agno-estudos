TED [VOICEOVER]: Wild, untamed, free. The sky for their roof, the earth for their floor. These brave horses of the wilderness roam the land thrilling in speed, proud in spirit, strong in courage. Like thieves in the night waiting for their prey, men come to conquer, to steal the freedom of these gallant animals. Outstanding in the herd, with less fear and more courage than the others, was a beautiful high-spirited red horse, the most desirable prize of them all. She was the one we were after. Well I wonder what Millerick wants with a wild horse. Don't worry about the boss. Any time he's willing to part with a couple of hundred there's a reason. You always have beautiful thoughts about people, don't you? Millerick's got an angle, I've got an angle, you've got an angle, that's all. Only Millerick's got more angles. Now take horses. No angles. They're honest, they're faithful. Some of my best friends are horses. [neigh] [music playing] She's a lot of horse. Proud, pretty, spirit. I think I'm gonna call her Bess. Bess? Yeah Bess. I knew a little redhead in Amarillo just like her. They're back. Well whata you know? Well, I'm glad you're back. So am I. You can start breaking the horse in the show this afternoon. Sorry Millerick, [inaudible] in the show. Since when do you [audio out]? She's my horse. You're getting paid for her. I don't want that reward. You found her on my time. Right Bud, you don't have to pay me for that. Nor the three weeks you owe me. For five days I fought with her and I'm keeping her. I'm not turning her over to you to break or sell. I don't like the way you treat horses. Oh you don't? Maybe you think I outta put carpets in the stalls? Why you-- I won't sell anything. Ever since Chesterfield, when we were at the water hole, I knew you were going to do that. Love at first sight. What are you going to do now? Where you going? You can't just wonder. She's gotta eat, and you're gotta eat. Don't worry, I'll figure something out. I'm Jim Moyer, foreman here, anything I can do for you? Thought you might need an extra hand. Well I might. That your mare? -Yeah. She broke in yet? No, not yet. Well, I guess there's always room for one more. One thing I ask though, hard work and no trouble. And break that horse in on your own time, huh? Thanks. Come on, I'll show you where to bunk. TED [VOICEOVER]: Training horses was always easy for me. And though I'd been around them since I was a kid, I'd never had an animal like Bess. [whistle] Maybe it was wrong, I didn't think so at the time, but I started teaching her tricks. High school stuff, we call it. Simple at first, like shaking her head to say yes, to stop and come to me when I whistled. Then more difficult tricks like shaking her hind quarters in rumba time. No tricks were too difficult. It was a big game. And besides, Bess was in love with me. Daniels, I'm gonna have to let you go. The horse takes up too much of your time. Well baby, looks like we're out of a job. I can see you're gonna be a lot of help to me, yeah. Beat it. All week long you've been in a rush, all week long. We're not heading any place particular and I don't care when we get there. [neigh] OK boss. Have it your way. All right old girl, you pick it. Just as long as you don't back track. TED [VOICEOVER]: They say it doesn't make any difference which turn in the road you take. We took the turn into town and it made all the difference in the world. Hey don't give me that baby, this was your idea. Bourbon. [SINGING] When I was a bachelor I lived by myself, I worked at the weaver's trade. The only, only thing I did that was wrong was to woo a fair young maid. I wooed her in the wintertime and in the summer too, and the only, only thing I did that was wrong was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew. Ted! Hello Woody. Where'd you come from? I just thought I'd renew acquaintances. Outfit looks the same, maybe a little seedier. Is this the same horse? Are you, baby? Tell me, where have you been? What have you been doing? What are you doing here? Well, I thought I'd pick up that prize money. Uh oh. Millerick ain't gonna like that. I could use 250 bucks. You know he always tries to keep the prize money in the show? Oh that's too bad. Still sign up for the contest with Billy? Yep. I think I'll go see her. See you later. Come on, baby. This contest open to all? Sure is. Ted Daniels! How's the Lots of Pretty Girls department? Oh can't complain. That isn't the wild horse? Bess, I want you to meet Billy. Tell me, do you think now that I'm no longer an employee the lady might go out with me? With a horse like that a man doesn't need etching. Now Bess, let's show Billy what you can really do, huh? Let's see here. That's fine, now rock it. Come on, rock it. Atta girl. That's a girl. Balance. Steady Bess. Hold it. Balance. Balance Bess. That's a girl. Take a bow, Bess.

Winner of the grand prize is number 78, Ted Daniels. Boy you really showed them. Hey what's the matter? What's wrong with him? I don't know he just keeled over. It's probably nothing. A man don't keel over from nothing, we gotta get him to a doctor. Go ahead if you wanna be a boy scout. Don't take too long. [moaning] I hope Bess isn't in the way, she won't cause any trouble. It's all right, dad'll take care of you. What's the damage doctor? You have a multiple fracture of the leg. Fix it up doc, I'm a guy that needs two good legs to make a living. Where's Ted? Woody took him to a doctor. He hurt bad? I don't think so. How did he make her walk up this plank? Why didn't you ask him? Come on. Come on get on this board. Back, back. Get in here. You knot head. Come on! Get in here. [neigh] Get up, get up. Come on, get in there. [neigh] [crash] Sounds like you got a riot on your hands, sheriff. [neigh] Here, I'll take care of this. Easy girl, easy. That's it. That's a girl. Whose horse is this? I don't know. Hey, this is my car. How about the damages? I'll hold the horse for security. Send your bills down to my office. Take her down to the stables. Come on, come on girl. Well so you're finally awake. He's coming along fine. How do you feel? My leg feels funny, I can hardly move it. Oh you'll get used to that. You're in a cast from your knee to your ankle. Cast? How long is that gonna last? Oh about 10 days. Then you can be moved outta here in a wheelchair. Wheelchair? Moved? Where? Well you have a family or some relatives that can take care of you. Not a one. Well you can't stay here, we're both overworked as it is. Oh dad I think we might be able to manage it. [ring] Has Bess been any trouble? I meant to ask you about that. She's wonderful. I knew-- You know you haven't stopped talking about Bess, who is Bess? My horse. She's here. No. There's no horse here. Sheriff wants to talk to you. Sheriff? Oh is it about my horse? Yes. She all right? I've got her at the stables. Oh that's a relief, thanks. Oh Sheriff would you do me another favor? I've got some money coming to me from the rodeo, would you mind dropping by and-- Don't waste no more breath son, the rodeo left town two days ago. Two days ago? And what's more I didn't come over here to do you no favors, I came over to see about these bills. What are those? Claims for damages done by your horse. Amounts to over $200. Excuse me. Dad, dad we've gotta let him stay here. Don't you see, he's helpless. Ah now you've helped plenty of people before when they've been down on their luck. I'll take care of him. Well I suppose we're stuck with him. At least you're stuck with him. Thanks dad. How do you expect me to pay these bills if you won't get my dough? It ain't my business to go chasing all over the United States after some rodeo. I can't chase after it, I can't move. Either the bills are paid, or I carry out my duty under the law. Which is what? I get a court order to sell your horse at public auction, and I pay off the creditors from the proceeds. Sell Bess? Oh Sheriff can't you wait till I get on my feet again? I'll pay the bills as soon as I can, honestly. I'm sorry son, it's got to be done the way it says in the books. Good day Miss Gray. Bye Sheriff. I've got good news for you, dad says you can stay. Hey, did you hear what I said? Yeah, thanks. Would you do something for me? Of course. They're gonna auction off Bess, would you find out who gets her? Sure. You know, I don't know your name. Penny, Penny Grey. Penny. I'm Ted-- Ted Daniels, I know. Woody told me. Glad to know you. All right ladies and gentlemen, we'll start the auction. What do I hear for an opening bid on this fine, flawless, spirited, mare? $100. $100 is bid. $110. $110. $110 is bid. Do I hear $120? $120. $130. $130 is bid. $140. $140 is bid. [neigh] $140, are you all through? Surely ladies and gentlemen I can hear more than $140 bid for this fine animal. $180. $180 is bid. Do I hear $190? Do I hear $190? $185? Do I hear $185? All right. $180 once, $180 twice, sold to the gentlemen over there for $180. Excuse me lady. Come on. It's a nice horse you've got there. Oh yeah, yeah. Were you planning on stabling her around here? Nope. Well um, can you tell me where you're taking her? Look lady, I'm working for an out of town buyer. I don't know who he is or what he's going to do with the horse. Come on. Come on, get in here. Woah. Come on, you. Come on, get in here now. Come on, get in here, get in here! Get in here! Why didn't you find out who he was, where he was going? Because I couldn't make him answer, he wouldn't tell me anything. That's great. I'm sorry Ted. I did the best I could. I-- excuse me, I think your lunch is about ready now. You're quite a surprise to me. I figured any man that Penny would go to so much trouble for would-- well would be a pretty solid guy. What are you getting at doc? She tried to buy your horse at the auction. Did you know that? Penny, your father told me about the auction. You gave me a book to read the other night. By Mark Twain? Yeah by Mark Twain. It had a line in it, something like, if you take a hungry dog into your house and feed it, it won't bite you. Which is a principal difference between a dog and a man. I wanna say that he's right, I'm sorry I just proved it. And Penny, I feel like talking some more, you'd better take advantage of it, I don't feel this way often. You see, until this accident happened I never had to count on anybody. I guess I never wanted to. Sort of an independent cuss. I, uh, worked for Millerick's rodeo for a while and for ranches around the country. And when I got tired I just quit and moved on. I was while I was working for Millerick that I found Bess. That's a story in itself. This may sound funny coming from a grown up guy, but she was the first thing I ever had of my own. The first thing I ever really wanted. Maybe you don't understand. Maybe it doesn't make sense. It's something you have to feel. Maybe I'm talking too much. Anyway. I think I understand Ted. Penny, the man who bought Bess, what did he look like? Was his name Millerick? No, I don't know. Uh was he a tough looking fellow with a broken nose? Yes he was Ted. When do you think I can leave here? Oh a month or so. A month? Bess what's the matter with you? Get in there! ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, we now for present our star attraction Bess the Wonder Horse. The horse with a human mind. All right Bess, take my hat off. Take my hat off. That a girl. Now don't get it dirty, don't get that hat dirty. I told you not to get that hat dirty. Now pick it up. Pick it up. Come on pick that hat up. What are you going to do about it now? Look at that, all dirty. Now what are you going to do with that hat? Oh you're going to brush it off? Atta girl. Come on clean it off, clean it off. That's a girl. That's a girl. Bess? You know what I think? I think these are the greatest horses in the world. Oh you don't think so, huh? Well who do you think is the greatest horse in the world? [applause] All right Bess, gimme a kiss, gimme a kiss. Come on, give me a big juicy kiss. Big juicy kiss. Atta girl. All right now gimme a hug. Come on, gimme a big hug. Gimme me a big hug. Come on, gimme a big hug. Big hug. Come on. [applause] All right Bess, now crawl like a baby. [applause] Thank you ladies and gentlemen. And Bess thanks you. [applause] TED [VOICEOVER]: For some reason the time at doc Grey's seemed to pass rapidly. Maybe Penny had something to do with it. Oh hey, take it easy. You're supposed to be the invalid and I'm exhausted. Me an invalid? Your father told me to get plenty of exercise. He didn't mean mountain climbing. We haven't started yet. Ready? Isn't this nice? Penny look! Looks like somebody's cabin. Now who'd build a cabin down there? Gang of moonshiners maybe. Or a murderer hiding out. Well if I'm right just of whiskey, if you're right we'll get shot that's worth a gamble any day. Come on let's have a look at it. [inaudible] Hey here's the answer, shack must have belonged to a prospector. Well evenin' Ted, any luck today? Yeah I found me a vein of gold worth maybe a million. Well, did you bring any of it home? Nope. Didn't seem worth the fuss. A city salesman came by today, but I threw some gold nuggets at him and told him to beat it. Good I don't want no strange man hanging around you. You know you-- Penny I'm leaving in a couple of days-- I-- I don't understand. I've seen what happens to guys who tie themselves town. They worry about their jobs, their family, the installments on the icebox. Perhaps they get something out of life you don't. Oh sure. Eventually they get to own the icebox. I'd hoped I'd changed your mind about that way of living. Changing isn't easy. It all depends on how much you want to change Ted. Oh Penny [inaudible] wanting something, that means a lot. There's so many things a man wants. He wants friendship, happiness, freedom. Well what about love. Someone [inaudible] a place of your own, like this. Dad owns it. I should've told you before. Those are the things that make a man change. You know that. It's hard to fight you Penny. You'll be back? Yeah I'll be back. After you get Bess. I've got a funny kind of rival, but maybe I'll like her. ANNOUNCER: All right Bess, bow for the ladies and gentlemen. [applause] Bess, let's see you imitate a camel. [applause] Bess the Wonder Horse. Woody! All right Bess, bow for the ladies and gentlemen. Come on, bow. Bow! Bow! Get down. Why didn't you let me know about this? It wouldn't have helped you. Might have helped her. Get down take a bow. Get down there. Get down. [applause] Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and Bess thanks you. Come on Woody. Pete. Yes sir? -Put her in a corral. -Yes sir. Come on Bess, steady. Come on. Bess! What's the matter with you? Get in there! Beat it. Fine things for a self-respecting horse to wear. What do you think you're doing? You've got eyes haven't you? I don't like what I see. I don't like a lot of things I've seen either. Get this Daniels, and get it straight. Every time you've been around this show there's trouble. What do you expect when your steers spout oil from their horns. What are you talking about. Skip it. I don't know what brought you here but-- I came for my horse, Your horse? She's my horse and you know it. Sure you've made a few bucks off her, you beat the spirit out of her, that's over. You understand Daniels that I bought this horse fair and square. Fair and square? Oh I don't understand that. I have a paper that gives a complete [audio out] of sale. I don't know about papers, or how a lawyer would look at this. But in my book you swindled me out of that horse. And there's a matter of $250 prize money. Oh that. To make it fair and square I'll forget about that. $250? The horses is the star of my show, she's worth thousands of dollars to me. Forget it. You keep your money, I take my horse. This is going to be a great partnership, I do all the work and you [inaudible]. I'm trying to dope out how I can get Bess. Why don't you just steal her? That's exactly what we will do. We'll go back tonight-- Don't be a fool Ted, that's all we need, a stolen horse. Anyway we can't stay around here to do our figuring. Come on get in. Will this [inaudible] now? It better. Keep your eyes on the temperature gage, will you? Take it easy Woody, we put plenty of distance between ourselves and trouble. That's what you think. You'll shake this thing to pieces. Don't worry about it, she runs better when she rattles. [crash] Runs better when she rattles, huh? Woody! Woody! Yeah I know, I know. It's Bess! Look who's here Woody. Come down here old girl. Bess old girl, you've solved a big problem. Come on kid. Ted we gotta talk this over. Go ahead. Come over here, I'm not at all sure that horse don't understand the language. The horse can't [inaudible] don't you. She's got as much right to quit the show as you have, more maybe, after the way she was treated. Oh get serious Ted. That horse is worth a lot of dough to Millerick. By now he's got every cop between here and the next county looking for her. Yeah? That's his worry. Well if you're picked up with Bess that's your worry. You'll get 10 years for horse stealing. Way I see it I didn't steal her she's still my horse. The way the law sees it she's still Millerick's horse. Look, you've had nothing but trouble ever since you found her. Maybe that's an omen. I'm not kidding Ted. In court it'd be open and shut. You beat a man up and stole his horse. No matter how you argued, they'd still send you up for that. What am I supposed to do? Be a good boy and send Bess back to Millerick? One thing you've got to do, you've gotta get rid of that horse quick. It's the law! Hide the horse. Howdy. Howdy. What's this, a accident? No it just died of old age. Oh that's too bad. Well I can't help you right now, I've got an important job. Is that so? Well then you'd better get going, don't worry about me. Oh say, you ain't seen nothing of a fellow with a stolen horse have you? Who me? No. Is that your important job? Looking for this fellow? Yeah and he's right desperate too. Is that so? Say whata you know, the deputy's on the trail of a horse thief. A real horse thief? Didn't know you had those any more. Yeah he's six foot tall, brown hair, brown eyes, and uses the name of Ted Daniels. Say, what's this written here? $500 reward for the horse? That's right. [whistle] [neigh] I thought you hadn't seen any horse. Well then where did this horse come from? What horse? This horse. Oh this horse? Yeah. I never saw him before in my life. I suppose she don't belong to nobody, just happened along. That's right. Maybe one of them wild horses you read about. And what would a wild horse be wearing all these fancy gadgets? Maybe she was just going to a party. That's enough. You fellows are coming with me. Wait a minute. I think we've got something here. This horse fits the description in the deputy's notebook. She does? Yes sir, this is a real break. It is? $500 reward. And can we use it. Say that's right. That's our dough, we found the horse. What do you mean you found the horse. I mean if you just found the horse I saw her first. Maybe we'll have to cut a him in. Well he was here when we found her. Yeah. OK pal, we'll make it a three-way split. There ain't gonna be no three-way split. You mean you'd just leave us here? And collect all that dough yourself? This horse is in my custody and I'm taking her back to town. Well that's fine, we'll ride along back with you. Sorry boys, there ain't no room. But maybe you'd like to follow me back in your car. Come on. For a guy that just got outta 10 years in jail you look pretty low. Look, the horse will be given back to Millerick, the cops will be called off, we've got nothing to worry about. We've gotta get Bess back Woody. Ha ha [inaudible] Let's get these [inaudible] off. [sirens] Oh I never thought I'd grow up to be a horse thief, but what can a fellow do. Come on, Bess. [SINGING] Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine you are gone and lost forever, dreadful sorry Clementine. How I missed, how I missed, how I missed my Clementine till I kissed her little sister and forgot my Clementine. What's with you? All day long you've been acting just like a cub bear. My friend our troubles are almost over. I mean it. We get four hundred miles between us and Millerick, we're almost home. Home. I wanna show you a little place just a few miles from heaven. Go on this is so pretty. There it is partner. Well Bess, how do you like it, huh? Just a few miles from heaven? Who measured. What more could a man ask? Well for one thing, a roof that don't leak. You're too finicky. All it takes is a few nails, a little dusting. Shh, don't talk so loud, it's liable to fall down on us. Listen, Woody, you don't seem to get what a great little place this is. There's hunting around here, and fishing, lots of ground, with a little work it can be fixed up. It takes a heap of sweeping to make a house a home. Home is where you hang your squeeze box. Say, not that this is any of my business but what's it all about? Woody, I've been doing a lot of thinking. This life it's no good, running from place to place, sleeping under trees. There are other things a man wants. The doctor's daughter? Yeah, the doctor's daughter. And a place of my own, a coral, lots of open country for Bess. Maybe I'll breed horses. Maybe an ice box. Woody I'm going to live like a normal guy. Yeah but you're not a normal guy. No? Then I will be. It's not that easy. A normal guy has a job, he isn't hunted by his enemies. A normal guy isn't wanted for horse stealing. Millerick, the law, that isn't it. It's a question of right or wrong, and that's inside of you. No it's on post office bulletin boards at police registers. That's behind me. It's not behind you. There's post offices and police stations in the state, in this county. There's insurance investigators and claims on a stolen horse. What Millerick has done has been wrong. Wrong for Bess, wrong for me. I know that. It wasn't Millerick who did wrong. Millerick didn't take that horse from the hills. Millerick didn't teach her how to count, to balance on a seesaw. He didn't teach her to rumba. You did that. And it was wrong. Because it was no more natural than teaching a man to pull a wagon or neigh. That's quite a lecture Woody. OK. I give up. I'm with you. Thanks pal. Oh if you're going along with me I want you do me a favor. OK. Stop by the doctor's house, tell the girl you saw smoke coming from the cabin. Huh? She'll catch on. Oh by the way we could use some food. Don't forget Bess. It's time she ate like a human being again. [neigh] Ted. Aren't you gonna say Ted, you're back? I'm not that conventional. It's conventional to kiss you know. All right. What do you think of her? More important, what does she think of me? Well baby? [inaudible] What does that mean? She likes you. Well you really cleaned the place up. We're gonna live here. You know it really isn't bad without the dust-- Ted we're going to what? Of course if you don't like it-- Don't like it? Oh Ted I love it. But um, what about the installments on the icebox? We'll pay them. How? I'll get a job. Let's see. It needs some curtains, I saw some beautiful material in town. And I think a lamp here. Yes, a student's lamp. And a couch here. Oh I'm going to run into town and have a look around. Hey wait a minute I just got back, remember? Ted! Ted! Over here Woody. Where's Penny? She's looking for curtains. Why? What's the matter? Millerick's in town, I was coming out of the saloon when I saw him. Did he see you? I don't think so, but we'd better not take any chances. He won't find us here. This time you'd better listen to me. Ted! Where's Ted? He's gone. Sit down Penny, I want to talk to you. So you see Penny? He had no choice, he owed that to Bess. He's quite a guy. I don't understand why he didn't tell me I'd have gone with him. Maybe that's why. But Woody I love the guy. He loves you too Penny, that's why he couldn't let you go. I don't understand. Yeah. Yes you do. [neigh] TED [VOICEOVER]: Dawn was just breaking when I stopped on the hilltop. I knew that I had to take Bess back where she belonged. What I didn't know was that I had company. Well Bess, it's the end of the line. Go on. Down there, that's where you belong. You're free now. I don't want you, don't you understand? No of course you don't. Go on Bess, go on beat it. Beat it! Go on Bess, beat it. Beat it! [neigh] Call her off! Call her off! [whistle] You've got something I want. Bess is back where she belongs. [neigh] Bess! Yes, she's back where she belongs.
