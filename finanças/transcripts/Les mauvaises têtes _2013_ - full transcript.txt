What are you doing? Changing the lock. You can't do that. You owe me three rents! I was waiting for the roofer! It's raining in my room! Fix it and I'll pay. Pay and you'll get the key! -You thief. -Yes. And my stuff? Bastard! Can you lend me some clothes? Yes. Somatic cells are diploid cells. They have 23 pairs of chromosomes. So, two genomes. On the other hand, haploid cells... Get off! Silence! Somatic cells... You made a bet? So, two genomes. Well done! You pissed off Drumont and vamped the theatre... Why not show your tits while you were at it? You went for a make-over? Bugger off. I think it's very sexy. Keep your compliments. What happened? -Can you put me up? -You're a pain. How come you're always in trouble? My parents don't support me. And I need to retrieve my stuff. I'm too nice. But you dress as usual. I live in a posh block, not in an estate. -Are you talking to me? -Of course not. -You have fun with your 5 brothers. -Four. Four! Can you give me the recording of the class? I don't get a treat? In your dreams. I'm late. The primary follicle has a bigger diameter than the primordial follicle. The primary follicle sees the transformation of follicle cells surrounding the oocyte in cubic cells. And the creation around the oocyte of the glycoprotein coat. Anyone knows what it's called? The zona pellucida. Hello. 10 euros. Thanks. Bye. ..create a second layer around the oocyte: the zona granulosa. The diameter of the oocyte keeps on growing bigger because of the multiplication of follicle cells up to 180 microns. At the end of the evolution you see the creation of a structure producing oestrogen. Pizza di Lione. That's cool. Sorry. Thanks. Sorry. Thanks. We won the race? Yes, we did. Your parents are farmers? You work for Soberg? Full time, good. I never saw you. Women's fashion. Let's call them. Only bankers can rent this room? No farmers, no food! "Own toilets." "Charmingly quaint." I would put you up but we're already squashed. I know. So? Now we have a lift, you might as well use it. I've walked up for 40 years. A pretentious young man won't change my ways! I need a room. You have a tip? Let's share my bed. What? You have a boyfriend? A boyfriend would mean failing my exams. Doctors are an inhuman breed. I'm missing 20 euros. And the pizzas you steal? You think I'm blind? With your fake ham, thanks! Go on, clear off. A room in a three-bedroom flat. Refurbished, quiet. You share with a young pensioner. 250 euros. Sales assistant at Soberg's. It pays well. Personally, I've never been. It's not to my taste. For me, it's just a job. It's mother. A wonderful woman. She died three months ago. Dad finds it really hard. Your parents are still alive? They have a farm in the Auvergne. I don't have time to go. They don't have time to come. I worry about dad. He can fall, feel faint. With your studies, you'll know what to do. Keep an eye on him. He must take his antidepressant. Check the box in the morning. Of course. Here is dad. This is Fanny, your flatmate. -Hello. -Hello. You'll get on well. If you say so, it should be the case. This is the girls' toilets! Marcus is a male skeleton. I signed. I'm so relieved. Me too! I'll be rid of your stuff. I'm off tonight! Thanks for your patience. Pretend you didn't see me. I don't like pretending. Let's swap biology sheet, I'm going to my private tuition. Your private tuition! You benefit from my parent's investment. He's jealous. His parents didn't want to pay for tuition classes and a studio. Look! Here. Sorry. With the flat hunting I didn't have time... What about us, you think we screw around? We each have a share to do. Whether you're homeless, ill, or shagging all night. I always do it. The exam is in 2 months! So you're either with me or against me. I messed up. I'll make it up. I'll summarise Maréchal's hefty tome on the abdomen. What? It's a slave's job! Perfect. I want the sheets by next Monday. Before the mock exam. And stop acting miserably. Let's go. If she finds Marcus and throws a fit, I'll report you. -Miss. -Yes? Anarchy isn't viable. I don't mind sharing my flat, but we need to stick to some rules. So, to clarify the situation, I put in writing internal rules. You just need to sign. Here. You're not reading? No time for this. Oh well... We'll each have a cupboard in the kitchen and a shelf in the fridge. Basic products will be bought in turns. Same thing with the bathroom. I put a roster on the door. For the washing during off-peak hours. No visit after 8pm. And the flat closes at 1am. OK? Switch of the lights during daytime. We're not in Versailles. Could you clear the boxes? I need space. My wife kept everything. It's a doily from Venice. Very nice. -It's my bottle. -Sorry, my mistake. I'll replace it tomorrow. Bye. Marie! It's that way? Of course. What are you doing? I don't know. But all this meat makes me hungry. I can't wait for the exam so it's all over. How is your flat share? -Can you work? -I'm progressing on the sheets. That's all I wanted to know. But it's not healthy to have to share your toilets. What about your landlord? I guess another lunatic. Remember the guy who hadn't been out of his flat for a year? He's retired. Widowed. He does table-turning to talk to his wife? No, he's perfect. Can we see your room and your flatmate? No. He collects art. His flat is like Fort Knox. A sort of museum. It's good for your work. It's yours. No need to. I trust you. Did you know there is a specific slot for DIY? No. 8.30am to 7pm. Oh, no, the guy who doesn't close his robe. Oh, the medical faculty! You go, I can't stand the smell. Fanny Moreno! Yet another outfit? Your Hawaiian pizza. Nothing better to do? I need a job. No bursary and no money from my parents. Who cares? You chose to study medicine. You take a job when you study literature or law, where you learn nothing. To succeed in medicine, you can't have a job. -Repeating your first year? -Yes. So this is your last chance. Keep the change. I don't believe it. Can you hear me? Open up! You old bastard! Miss? What time is it? 6.50am. Coffee? Yes, please. How do you want it? Short? Long? Quick. The old man is giving you a hard time. Why not move out? No time, no money. I do medicine. Well done. A healthy spirit in a healthy body. Talk to Marthe, his daughter. You're just like him! There's no rush. Fresh orange juice? A muffin? You must be hungry. You're not the only one. Everybody is complaining. He was horrible during the works. I bought the flat 3 years ago. I knocked down all the walls. The combination of light and volumes... It's my job. I'm an architect. Doing a split-level with his flat would be ideal. But... His wife died, not him. Thanks for coffee. Never do that again. We signed a contract. I work day and night, like crazy. I'm knackered! -We said 1am. -Damn it! I wasn't having fun. I was delivering pizzas to pay my fucking rent. So you're not working at Soberg's anymore? I work where I can. My money doesn't grow on a tree. I had to study on your doorstep. It's not fair. I have to go out again. If I make an exception, rules will go down the drain. You can keep your shitty advice for yourself. You know how to piss me off but you can't talk to your daughter. You should have said you didn't want me. Now you're stuck. Your sheets are great. Thanks. It wasn't an easy job. Sorry I was so harsh. My parents put pressure on me. Mine worry about the weather and the tractor loan so they don't call me. By the way, you left this. I forgot to bring them back to her. You're doing her a favour. A homeless wouldn't take it. It's good to laugh. I worry about the mock exam results. -Not you? -No. Because I don't overlook anything. QED. OK, but still, we're 2,500 for 350 places... I'm sorry but you have to go. No revisions? -My parents are coming. -Are you ashamed of me? No, I'm ashamed of them. Here. Yes. You left me a message? Yes. In fifteen minutes? See you soon, bye. What are you doing? This is the top of the list. 17th. You're screwed! -153th. -268th. -Well done. -17th. And a first year. It's obscene. What about you? I lost 200 places compared to December. Great! It's only a mock exam. Get back to work. -We'll work together. -Yeah. Go to the movie, get some sleep. Tomorrow, we get back into it. You'll make it. I've given up. I lost my dedication. -I don't feel like it anymore. -You'll regret it. I don't think so. Bye and thanks for everything. -Sylvain... -Let him be. It's really hard for him. Moreno! I have a mission for you: extract this bottle from the machine. I do that at the pizza place. Your rank? -268. -Not enough to catch up my subject. But I work hard. OK, but if you lose 300 places in cellular biology, 268, it's not enough. And thank you? Leave me alone. Be reasonable. What does it mean? "Do what I say"? You didn't do your blood test. Why would I do it? I'm in good health. Tomorrow, you have an X-ray. Tomorrow, I can't. I won't go. You will. We booked it a month ago. I'll make you go. I'm meeting someone. Who? How much did the show-off offer you for the flat? -Here we go again. -I'll never sell. -Tell him. -I have also my say in this. I'm putting up with all your whims, but if one day... If you can't live alone... It's my life, my area, my block... ..my memories! I prefer to die in my living room like a dog. You're really unpleasant. Can't you say a kind word? Come here... See you Friday. -I put it on your account? -Yes, please, Mourad. With my pension and half of Monique's pension, it's tight. But it'll get better, I've rented out my daughter's room. It's OK. Pay at the end of the month. Thanks, Mourad. You've been in the area as long as me, no? 1972 ! Like me! The neighbourhood changed with all the fast-foods. The Pizza di Lione. Yes. It was called "Chez la mère Marcelle". Sometimes we used to go on Sunday with Monique. We liked their quenelles. And their boeuf bourguignon, do you remember? Here... Have a nice day, Mr Paul. You want some soup? I oiled the hinges on your window. -It won't squeak. -OK. You must see my point about yesterday. When you come back late, it wakes me up and I can't go back to sleep. You never put away the washing liquid. And I told you to switch off the lights in the daytime. -You do it on purpose? -I don't have time for this. For my old fart's habits? The old fart has his habits. You need to respect that. I worked all my life to buy this flat. 30 years in the hardware department at the Grand Bazar and that's it. It's not as posh as being a doctor, of course! Yeah... And... When my wife was around everything was absolutely spotless. She's gonna stay on the dresser forever? Does she bother you? No. I can't stand seeing you do this. Give them to me. Show me. I'll sort this out. I'll fix it. - I tightened both screws. - Thanks. You're still as old as before. Yes, but I still see with my own eyes. Do I owe you something? I need a favour. Well... On Wednesdays, I visit a friend in hospital. I can't go this time because of these bloody X-rays. So could you bring her a brioche? A brioche? She's in a rehabilitation centre. As you know, hospital food is disgusting. She's been eating toasts for a month. She can't wait for her snack? It's a real home-made brioche. I committed to it anyway. She's lonely, she has no family. I'm not little red riding hood. I'm struggling for time. The hospital is next to your faculty. Not really. Listen... I'll do your washing-up for a week. It will make up for lost time. Three weeks. And 15mn extra in the bathroom. OK. And could you listen to another disc? That's out of the question. My wife loved Dalida, it was our song. And the boxes on my wardrobe? Hello. You must be Miss Dumas, Paul asked me to bring you a brioche. Oh, Paul, his brioche is really scrumptious. I'm Virginie Dumas. Paul is in trouble? No, he had a health check. You must be Fanny. Paul's tenant. She studies like crazy to become a doctor. It's serious stuff. No visits. Work, work, work. And you have a very bad diet. Paul is worried. I didn't think so. I put 40. It's too much for me, I throw in my hand. Have a drink. No, I need to study. Really, young people nowadays only think about studying. At my age, it was more... Pierre... Jacques, Miguel... Abdel... Enjoy life. You could die tomorrow. No, sorry, I must go. Bye. Bye, Miss. "Gérard, my love. "I'm 31, and I'm in love for the first time. "You mean so much to me. "You were my only love. "Three years since we kissed. "I miss you. "When I'm at the hotel with you, I feel like a real woman. "With you, I feel like a real woman." You're so passionate about medicine! You come here to suffer an attack of hypoglycemia. I must go. Don't move. Doctor's orders. Can't you see you're overdoing it? Here is a meal before you go back home. With that, she won't get full. You can't smoke that in here, Miss Duparc! It's Dumas. Call the drug squad if you want! I need this to put up with this military regime. How did you meet Paul? At the Grand Bazar. I was in the lingerie, 1st floor. Paulo was on the 2nd floor, hardware. We met for 30 years in the shop so we ended up bonding. We were dreaming of other things. I would have liked to brighten up his life. But there was Monique. Monique! He had to rush back home because of Monique! Now, we could... But no, because there is always Monique. Monique! Here... Here! Here! "My love!" Where did you find this? -Great! -10th page on the net. I owe you. You want sheets from my private tuition? On renal physiology? -I thought you gave them to us. -Not all of them. -I'm paying for it! -You're... A bitch? Yes. Have you heard from Sylvain? I thought your parents supported you. My mum works in a night-club. And it's my life. It's depressing. My parents can't help me but there are other ways. To pay 500 euros of private tuition and revise 6 hours at night? I'll pass this exam. I do all I can to pass it. Me too. With a job in the evening? In your dreams. Bilal is coming to revise. Go elsewhere. Give me a break. -I won't tell him. -Go away! Give me three archaeas. Thermophilum, haloferax, and methanobacterium. Good. Are prokaryotic cells capable of endocytosis? I don't know. I hate this subject. I hate Drumont. We're nuts to study so much. It goes against nature. We should just enjoy life and do nothing else. We're like old people. I totally agree. We need to work. The share of a polysaccharide in a cell? What? The share of a polysaccharide in a cell? -I don't know. 3%? -No. 2%. Are you with me? You're burning! She's burn... She's burning... She's burning with love. And Sylvain? I don't know what he's up to. It's a shame he gave up. See you tomorrow? We haven't finished. Let's go to your place. I won't touch anything. I don't want to be in trouble. He's a real lunatic. He banned all visits. -Are you going out with him? -You're so dumb. He's old and retired. We're knackered and we still need to put in 3 hours of revision. Go. Come on! -Good evening. -Good evening. I wanted to tell you... -Forget our conversation. -It's forgotten. Can you hold this for me? Paul! You're OK? Paul! Wake up! Paul! You're OK? Say something! Anything! The smell of croissants. Yes, croissants? In my grand-father's bakery, the noise of the kneading machine. -He was the king of puff pastry. -Yes. -And Monique... -Hello. Yes... Monique never ate my brioche. Never. What a fool! "It's too fatty!", she said. She was always on a diet because of this bastard. Monique thought she was vulgar. And it's not vulgar to lie and cheat all your life? Really... No. -Drink this. -No! It's lucky you found him on time. He's OK. -Let's go. -Thank you. Bye. The drip has an anti cyanhydric? Yes, because of the smoke. -Are you studying medicine? -I'm in first year. First year... Look what I have. The laboratory's file. You have the drug's description and even the weight of the molecule. It can't go wrong for him and he can't have hypothermia. -But keep an eye on him. -Of course, I will. Thanks. You should stay in bed. I feel very well. I'm just a bit... What's the smell? Stinky cheese. Delicious. Sent by my parents. You want some? No, thanks. I don't know what I drank. I'm sorry about last night. What got into you? Imagine if I hadn't come back. It's strong! Really strong! I need to stay awake in class. I haven't slept a wink. Don't do that again, OK? Should I call Marthe? Oh, no, please! Don't do that. Ah... No... I just had a big fit of blues. That's it. It's over. You live your life with someone and suddenly everything collapses. You realise it was all fake. OK, but now we put another record on. Stop complaining. I don't risk my life each time I'm in trouble. It's not the same, you're young. Stop acting like a dinosaur. Go and see Virginie more often. She's fun and she likes you a lot. Are you kidding? I'm not her type. I just do courtesy visits. That's not how I see it. You should go. You promise me? Don't worry, the beast isn't dead. Don't bang the door. Middle-class, about 40. Who gives her orchids. We had been so close all evening. -What did she say? -Nothing. We can't trust her. Hello. I had such a tiring night. You're OK? Yes. Drumont is late. You can tell her. End of the class. End of the year. Learn these tables by heart, they form the basis of a good exam's DNA. Good luck for your revisions. Say bye to Marcus, it brings good luck. Or not. No, leave her. You let her sleep? That's kind of you. Shit! A month? I have my exam in 2 weeks! It's really an emergency. Then go to hospital. I've just been. They only deal with serious matters. You're not on your own. The waiting room is full. It's very busy. -So July 13th? 11am? -Mrs Romanier. Romanier Moreno, yes. It's scrumptious, as ever. With your gloomy look, it feels like I'm eating a host! What's the matter? -What's happening? -Nothing. Are you behaving like that towards sweet Fanny? Tell me... You don't deserve her, old fart. Did you know about Monique and Gérard, the head cashier of the hardware department? Yes, Paulo, I knew it. What difference does it make? At the Bazar, they all took me for a fool. Paul the cuckold. With Gérard, Giscard's double. When I think I was mad about her. And during that time... I sacrificed my life. For her! Sacrifice has nothing to do with love. I'm sorry you only hear about it now. What do you know about love? You spent your life squandering your money. I didn't save up, true, but I had fun. Yes. Now you're on your own, with your small pension, no kids. Nobody visits you. That's it... You're right, I messed up. I accept it. Friends are waiting for me to play poker. I don't mean to be hurt you, but they're more fun than you. Miss! -It's 120 euros. -120? Excess of the statutory fee. -You're insured? -Can I pay later? Payment rejected. Can I write a check for the 30th? That's for the excess. It's a letter from the managing agent. You need to pay your charges. I was against the lift. You can't carry on avoiding paying. And why did firemen came during the night? These glasses suit you. Trendy, elegant, it's totally you. How much? -600 euros. -What? Don't you have offers? With your prescription, it will be a minimum of 300 euros. This line didn't work. I can do them for 310 euros. I'm ugly but I need them for tomorrow. -OK. We need an account. -I'll pay in full tomorrow. We've had mishaps before so we're extra careful with clients. -Can I write a check? -No. A card? That's all I have. I guess at your level, it's a commitment. Bilal, it's me. Why don't you pick up? I had a bad day. Call me back. Lots of love. Here are your three pizzas. Due Calzone. Due Vesuve. Una Quattro Stagioni. Do them well, they're for the superintendent. Don't be stingy on the oil. Sexy, your short-sighted look. Hello? Mario, I need an advance. An advance? Are you kidding me? I lost my best clients. Cops! Can you read? "Washing-up liquid." You're always late, you steal, and now that. I can't take it any longer. You're fired. I'm going! It's a crap job! I've had enough of being underpaid. I want you to pay me! In your dreams! You're screwing my company and you want me to pay you? You owe me money! You're OK? Bilal, it's me. Why don't you pick up? I hope nothing happened to you. I really had a super shitty day. Call me back, I'm down. The smell of burnt, the firemen. If he puts the block on fire... Aren't you exaggerating? He's not getting any younger. I'm not a neurologist but... -What do you mean? -You need to check on him. I found his tenant sleeping on his doorstep. Dad, what did you do? Don't start! It's your mother. What? She kept her cards close to her chest. I didn't know her. Neither did you. It's over. I won't see her again. Over! Where is mum? Where she always was. Between the wax and the bleach. She loved scrubbing. If she saw this mess... You're coming with me. -No way. -You're insane. I can't leave you on your own. It's not safe. I'm very well. I feel totally sane. I'm staying here. If I go to the solicitor and ask for my share, you'll have to sell. It's the law. Go ahead. Go on, kick me out of my own flat if you dare! Be my guest. It's my fault. I'm sorry. I drank too much last night. I collapsed on the chair. And then I blacked out. I can't remember a thing. I must have fallen asleep with a cigarette. It won't happen again. No, it won't. You're leaving. No. She's "my" tenant. Come on... An arsonist. Let's say it was my half that burnt. Not yours. Now you're reassured... You can go. You saved my life. If you sell, I'll be homeless again. It was very courageous. How can I thank you? Ask me what you want. I need 300 euros. I'll pay you back. I need the money today to pay for my glasses. I don't have that kind of money. I need them to revise my exams. I want to help you. You don't trust me. I can sign an IOU. I trust you. But I can't. No need to insist. But you owe me. I saved your life. It's because of you if I didn't sleep and broke my glasses. I'm sorry. Sorry? That's all you have to say? You're an old selfish miser and you're useless. You're a millstone. Yes, mum. No, I'm fine. My voice is fine. No, it's fine. And you? Sorry, but I have too much work, I need to go. Lots of love. Hello. -Hello. -Jessica. Youth is a miracle! -Your name? -J.P. Jean-Pierre, Jean-Paul, as you want. What do we drink? It depends on the effect you want. Whisky is a tranquilliser. Champagne is an aphrodisiac. I often come to Lyon, I'm a surgeon. I think we'll get on fine. -Put this on my note. -Thanks, M. Beruchaud. Beruchaud? Jean-Patrick Beruchaud? The neurosurgeon? Your article on the hemangiopericytoma in the nervous system was fascinating. According to professor... Drumont. A friend of yours? You know Drumont? Yes, I have her this year. But don't worry, she doesn't like me. She won't know JP likes fresh blood. Let's go up to my room. It's none of your business. I drank enough to make it. I can forget about my exam. I can forget about my glasses. I can forget about my revisions. I can forget about my exam. And I can't even pay my rent. You can kick me out. I was such a fool to think I could make it. Medical studies... It's a middle-class thing. And here was I, big-headed. For my parents, paediatric nurse was already great. But I wanted to aim even further. Without a penny. Drumont is right. Stop talking and listen to me. You're staying here. I'll find a way to get the money. But don't try to sell your body. Ever again. You hear me? We're not Wednesday. Don't be so shy, come in! What's happening? I need 300 euros. 300 euros? I'm not Rockefeller! It's not for me. It's for Fanny. I can only ask you. She needs it today. I don't have it, sorry. And I lost at poker. And those clothes... Who are you mourning? Myself. I'm being transferred to the geriatric service. Because I can't go back to my place. With my new hip, 6th floor without a lift, it's like climbing the Himalayas. You see, it's the end for me. So given the situation, I dressed accordingly. You won't go there. Where are you taking me? Let me deal with it. Don't turn round. Paulo, you're full of beans! Paulo... You're kidnapping me. I can't watch people struggle: you, the girl. It's not possible. I can't watch her sink and do nothing. I must do something. I will do something. Hello. I'm here to pick up my grand-daughter's glasses. Fanny Moreno. Of course. Here they are. And I need sunglasses. I'm off to Seville and lost mine again. I need something chic but simple. I saw some over there. Let's see. That's not possible. -Let's try. -Hello. Hello. That's too extravagant. -Not possible. -Try these. Thank you. Not bad. But no! No. Never mind, I'll buy some over there. -Sorry for the trouble. -You're welcome. Goodbye. The centre of vision, you know something about it. No? Because of the pizza! This is for your hangover. And this, for your revision. How did you do that? I stopped being a miser and broke my piggy bank open. I won't be able to pay you back. We'll see later. When you're a doctor. Why did you do that? Why does the old fart wake up now? I saw you live and work. You give everything. I don't want you to waste your life like I wasted mine. Out with the chores! Cooking, washing, housework, we'll do it for you. -A new housemate? -Yes. For once, the lift is useful to someone. A tenant that will be on your back. Get down to work. -Why are you doing this? -You know very well. I know you're a bastard. I give you 5 euros and you shut up. Bugger off, put earplugs. You behaved like prince charming and now it's over? We're not glued. I didn't promise you anything. You want to go solo? That's what everybody does. Carry on, you'll get there. Try one more time. Shall we try? Paulo, give me a break. Just once, come on. Here. I'll help you. Go on. Here. Hold on... That's it. -It's good. -It hurts. You're walking! It's very good. M. Rivet, hello. A signature. -Thanks. -Have a nice day. What is it? Can I? You owe 800 euros to the managing agent? 269 euros for gas? What are you doing? When did you stop paying your bills? Six months ago. What are you waiting for? Winning the lottery. You have a pension. With the charges... And without Fanny's rent, what do I have left to heat myself and eat? What can I do? I'm not going to rob a bank! First things first. We'll pay the 40 euros to stop the procedure. That's all we have left to finish the month. We'll make do. -A problem? -No. It's an old couple's thing. Go back to work! You put it on my account? No, Paul! We said the end of the month. Then the end of the following month... I can't do it any longer. Mourad, as a one-off. My family got bigger. What about my family? I'm not a banker. OK. I'll put them back. That's the one I want. 1,180 euros, it's not possible. Oh, sweetie pie, I beg you. Tomorrow is the final. I need a TV. What about a loan? 3 years, no deposit. 77 euros per month. The interest rate? 17,89%. They'll bleed us dry. It's our usual rate. I don't have my wallet or any ID on me. We'll come back Monday. It will be too late! No. We can find an arrangement. You can take a model on display. You sign the credit and as an exception I'll wait Monday or Tuesday for your papers. You'd do that for me? I know I can trust you. Thank you. Show me. It's the right one. -It's legal? -What? I'm kidding! How much did we say? Half the price of the store, 590 euros. 590? Not 600? You're really not a thief. -Here, take 600. -Thanks. My uncle is paying for it. Next time, could I get a Wii? -A what? -A Wii. -Yes, but with a deposit. -What do you mean? 3 pizzas Napolitan and a bottle of wine for tonight. I'm kidding. Chef! There's not much on a Napolitan. But there is something. Where is the cheese? I'm not delivering this. I'm looking for Fanny. -Fanny Moreno. -Why? It's none of your business. I don't know any Fanny. You're Omar? You're Bilal? I saw her cry when she rang you. You're a wanker. -She needs someone who loves her. -Like you? Why not? I wouldn't let my fiancée, half blind, walk back home on her own. Please. Now you're talking. That's better. You look like you're in love. No kissing at the counter. Why not? Omar asked me to deliver this. Thanks. It's paid for already. You're Fanny's flatmate? And her servant? No, I'm the landlord. What does he want? Fanny, I'm sorry. You dump me and then you expect me to be overjoyed to see you? Virginie, put an extra plate. Oh, lovebirds. Enough! It's 10pm, tomorrow... It's exam day! Come on! I'll walk you downstairs. Youth! They might get married. Talking of marriage... Yes, Paul? We're too old to wait. -And? -And... Do you want to marry me? No. I have the honour of refusing to marry you. I haven't burnt my bra when I was 20 to marry at my age. But you're the woman of my life. The real one. That, I take. Totally. I take your love. Not marriage. I have dreams and you're part of them. And if I have one dream it's to travel with you. Going to the town hall it's not enough ambitious when you dream of tropics! Spain. Really! And you were lecturing me. I can't leave you 5mn. You're scared? No. I'm a fighter. Well, I thought I was. You are. A right. A left. A right. A right. Hit harder! Don't fight, please? Who started it? I can't believe this. Come on, let's go! The moment of truth! The laboratory's file. There is the drug's description and the weight of the molecule. Please. Can we close the shutters? Last time I had such a headache was at the Authorities for Budgetary control. What a question! It wasn't in the syllabus. Authorities for budgetary control. ABC, you saved me. Me too, thanks. -But I didn't tick that. -Why? It doesn't work. Polymers OK, but not the wool. The combustion of wool releases acid cyanhydric. Moreno, can I talk to you? Professor Zinner's card. He's at Sainte-Cécile clinic. He's looking for a night part-timer to deal with worried parents who mistake a stomach bug for a peritonitis. Ideal for a future intern. Thank you. What happened? You have things to tell me. They've been stealing for two weeks: food, drugs, vitamins, a TV, and even glasses. We've nicknamed them Bonnie and Clyde! I don't understand. -My father is an honest man. -You know... With a 900 euro pension, and inflation, it's common. We see elderly people everyday. We have special cells. -You're arresting them? -It's all because of her. I didn't know she lived with him. You should have told me. I'd have helped you. I can manage on my own. You won't get off lightly. Given your age, shopkeepers are ready to drop the case if you reimburse them. This is where we go our separate ways. You think I'm going to let him pay back on his own? I need to pay back. They did it for me. Enough. I'll pay back everything. I'm used to dealing with my dad's blunders. But you're coming with me. -I'll keep a close eye on you. -No, Marthe. It's my decision. OK? I'll be paying my debts. And I'm staying with Virginie. Dad... Listen to me. We've been playing outlaws. But it was for Fanny. We sponsored her. If I had to do it again, I'd do it again, my eyes closed. No hesitation. Understood? How did your exam go? Not bad. That's a good thing. -It's not a done deal. -Almost, I'm sure of it. -Not so fast! -Come on... They didn't do a good job when they searched me. We've just come out of the police station. Precisely, I need to relax. But go ahead. I'll join you. Go on! Today is a big day. Lift! You made peace? Yes, we forget the past. I'm starting a new life. I'm happy. It's thanks to you. I didn't do anything. You did. You pushed me, shook me, you even hurt me a little. Sorry. You showed me the way. Never give up, always fight. And aged 70, I'm starting to live. It's fabulous. But I need to stay focused. Go on. I need to go to the end of this. 350,000. You said 400,000. But you had the advantage. It's mean. Don't lecture me. You could be in prison. You're stuck. You sell or you go to prison. We have another buyer. Who is offering more? No, less. But to have the pleasure of selling to someone else, M. Rivet is ready to lose money. Correct. The sell would amply cover his debt. So he still keeps the advantage. Sorry. It's 380,000 or nothing. Sorry. Sorry... I'm in a wheelchair. Please, let me pass. Thanks. Sorry. Give priority to the wheelchair! Thanks! I take from 200. -And I take from the start. -OK! We should have gone. It's worse to wait here. Yes? I'm 212. I'm 212! You're 157. And Marie? 21. -What? -Really! You scared us! -I wanted to be in the top 10! -We don't care. It's done! What's the surprise? Wait. Stop! Open your eyes. Oh, my God. -Our new house. -Oh, my God! So life isn't over? No. Going on a world trip is reckless. You won't have to worry about your dad anymore. And you can inherit your mother's share. I'll take up a life insurance. She'd have liked that. It's not too late to disobey her. My little girl. You'll come back? I don't know. Virginie is going to improvise. My brioche's recipe. You'll see. If you're a bit down, it's magic. Thanks. It's so nice! "Not Just Married." SUBTITLES : RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
