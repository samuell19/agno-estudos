Sometimes I think I see her in the street, but it's not her, of course. I feel stupid when that happens. She's gone. You okay? Danny! Jack? I'll pull. Danny's smoking in his room again. I can smell it. What's this, mummy? Can I have a look? Mommy gave me this. What are you talking about? It's for us. Did you find this? I told you. Mommy gave it to me. What the fuck are you talking about? Can I buy some binoculars with it? These ones are good. 319,99 £. Online. Top bins. There's 650 £ in there. Maybe you can get a pair too? That's mommy. She did it herself. Do you like it? Yes I do. She must have been very clever. She is ... talented, that's what she is. I'll pour. Milk and sugar? Just a drop of milk please. Thank you. Right. ... Well. From what I understand, you've no other family. You are provided for though. In fact, you're very well provided for. Which means, there'll be lots of options for Jack to be looked after. Danny! Sorry? Danny will look after me! It's all in the will. Mommy says no boarding school or foster care or anything. So it'd be like before. What do you think about that, Danny? That's what he wants. What she wanted. Yes, but it's a very, very big responsibility. I'm 18! I don't think you quite understand. Would you like a biscuit? No, thank you. Okay, right. What I'm going to do is grant you an interim care order. Thank you. I have to tell you, though, that means the situation will be monitored and reviewed. Time to get up! Leave me alone! Have you packed? I've got a party. We're going to the cottage. I'm supposed to be DJing. Danny, I've told you. We going away. Geek! Loser! No!

Oh, my clever boy. My beautiful boys! Oh, Jack. Take that away, please! I just wanted to show you. Just get it away from me! I'm sorry! That's all right. It's ok. It's ok. It's passing. I'm fine. I'm fine. You told me it didn't hurt. I just forgot to take my medicine. Jack! Feeling better? Fine darling, I'm fine. I can't bear the thought of you worrying about me. Don't worry! I'm not! Good. You're strong like me. But what about Jack? What about? I need you to look after him. Don't say that! I can't rest unless, I know that you'll look after him. All right. Promise me always. Promised.

I'm just so ... bloody naked, I can't think straight. Go away! Okay. We'll go get the sudden cereal. You know, there's a pair of peregrine falcons nesting in sussex heights. The tower block?! The fastest bird in the world! Really? In a dive. It's true! Do you want to go and see them? Not particularly. Oh, please! No, Jack, it's not my thing. You need to get out more.

Grab hold of it. Take hold of it. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Danny. Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! So stupid! Do be more careful! You are soaked! Come ... better get you home. Would you like to join us? So, uh, when's your parents get back? There's only our mum. So, what about your dad? He left when Jack was a baby. Do you ever see him? Nope! I don't know where he is. Thanks. Hot chocolate? Jack, that's so sweet. Thank you. Why don't you just sit on the sofa? I like your dressing gown. Thank you. It's 100% cotton. My pyjamas are too. I know, because I always check the labels. So, do you like your hot chocolate? Yes. Thank you. It's ethically traded. Mommy gets everything that's ethically traded. ... apart from my cereal. Yeah, okay, Jack. Well, I think it's very nice. And thank you for making me feel so at home. You're not supposed to smoking. Jack! Well, you're not. Who's gonna stop me? Aren't you clever? It's easy once you get going. I can teach you sometime. Yeah, okay. Why don't you two go out? Go to the cinema. I'll be fine on my own. Unless you two don't like each other. Jack! What? She's called Zoe. And she's very kind. A lot kinder than Danny. He's out of control. Perhaps he's start being nicer to me, now that he's got someone to talk to. Wow, you've been busy. Oh, shit! Look at what you've done. It's just milk. Look! Filthy, dirty pig! I'll clean it up. Filthy! Dirty! Pig! Filthy! Dirty! Pig! Filthy! Dirty! Pig! Fucking lunatic! We should get someone. Not yet. Not!

Yeah, I'll be there. Oh, perfect. Tea, alright? Yeah? Ok. And bisquits. Oh, and there is a parents' evening tonight. I'll be there. I've got you the time. 6:30 pm Two sets?

I got a call from the hospital Your mother's not well? A lovely little place. Up here is it? Are you're here on holiday? Oh, my goodness! This is your mummy? What's your name? Go away, please. It's all right, Jack. I just take a look at your mummy, Jack. Go away! I just like to see, that she's all right. She's sleeping. Danny! Danny! Well? Look, I'm sorry about Jack. It's not just Jack. I'm dealing with it. The two of you alone in the house. Parents evening! The dummy! Zoe! Where's your mum? Danny, where is she? She's dead! What? She's dead. Why didn't you tell me? What difference does it make? She just told me everything. Yeah? Yeah! I don't want to play happy family, Zoe. And I'm fine! No, you're not! Danny!? Where are you going? I've got a gig in London. Can I come with you? Look, I got you that pizza and that chocolate you like. There's money on a table, if you want to get a takeaway. I've got to go, Jack. You'll be fine. I don't want to be alone! Why? Just lock the door behind you. I'll be back in the morning. Zoe? What about her? Can't she stay with me? Maybe if you didn't try to frighten her. She shouldn't have messed up mummy like that. I've got to go! Take me with you. No! Why not? Because it's a fucking nightclub! They won't even let you in! I'll leaking and hide. No! It's not gonna happen! Ahh, just stop it! Stop it!

I can smell it on clothes. Now, have you been smoking? All right, I can't cope. You win. Not about winning, Danny. It's about doing what's right. For both of you. Just find him somewhere nice. Hey. Jack. You need to go to the office. Come in. Shut the door. What do you want? I've come to see you. Why? I've got some good news. I found a family for you. What? Now Jack, they're very excited about getting the chance to meet you. So, I thought that we would go straight away, right after school. But I don't want to meet them. Why not? We agreed! Danny did talk to you? About what? He asked me to find a foster family for you. No! Jack! Jack!? Jack! Yeah, Hello. What's happened? Fuck! Jackie here? Jack? Jack, where are you? Leave her alone!

Look, he's bound to be upset. The thought of a change like this can be frightening. And after the shock he's had. Yeah, but that's just it! He's gotta stay with me. Does something happen, Danny? Danny? What's happened, Danny? He's just tried to kill himself. Oh God! I promised him. This is serious now. Stay with him. Why? What's he got to do with you? It's out of your hands now.

It's no good, Jack. Sorry. And let's just get away. We have to go. Please! Don't worry about your exes. What? Where you going? Oh, Jack, come on. Jack! What are we doing here? I saw these at a service station Are they all right? I know, they're not the ones you wanted. The guy said they were good. Come, Jack, let's give them a go. What are we going to do? Now there's a bird. We'll take a look then, Jack. What are we going to do? Selfish bitch. Stupid savage bitch! Don't talk about mummy like that! What's this? What is this? Her pills. What pills?
