- The Raft - ﻿The sea doesn't except us all. ﻿It's vast, infinite almost. ﻿But not everyone has a place in it. ﻿It is picky, ﻿It feels us, measures, judge ﻿And eventually decides whether to take us to its depth ﻿Or throw us back to shore. ﻿To most of us, there is no other way ﻿But to the seamen, there is. ﻿Those who dare, the calm, those with a whole spirit ﻿The sea acts differently with them. ﻿It takes time, ﻿Sometimes too much time. ﻿But in the end it embraces them. ﻿And in return, ﻿they'll love it forever. ﻿We gathered here ﻿To salute a legacy of an outstanding sailor ﻿That loved the sea, and it love her back. ﻿A real sea-woman. ﻿Before she was taken from us, ﻿She got to teach some of you ﻿In an uncompromising personal guidance. ﻿She made you a seaman as well. ﻿It is only natural to call our sailing club after her. ﻿Rona, in character and in spirit, ﻿Represented everything we want to represent as a club. ﻿More than anything... ﻿Yes! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿1 -1 Haifa against Liverpool. ﻿She spoke to the sea... ﻿Take it out of your ear already. -Stop it! ﻿And I swear ﻿That it spoke to her as well. -I'm going to watch the second half. ﻿You are not going anywhere, Ido, come here. ﻿They knew each other. ﻿That is the only way to explain ﻿Why she didn't fear it at all... ﻿-In the presence ﻿-Of the incredible strength of the sea ﻿I'm asking you, stop for a second. ﻿I told you there is a game today, right? ﻿People came especially to hear us talk about mom. ﻿You throw everything for a soccer game? ﻿I would like to invite Reuven, and Ido, her son, to say a few words. ﻿I would like to thank Dudi ﻿And to everyone here in the club. ﻿Come on, move, come on. ﻿Come on. ﻿Why did he give 4 minute injury time? ﻿Antisemitic judge. ﻿Kick it, what is he doing? come on! ﻿Just so you know, statistically, on the 92nd minute there ﻿is the highest probability to score. ﻿Who are you cheering for? ﻿What? Only statistically speaking... ﻿Erez, you dork, put the volume down, I'm on the phone! ﻿Inbal, shut up, 1-1, you think I care? ﻿Come on? ﻿Yes! Yes! -Yes! ﻿Yes! Thank god! ﻿Eighth final! -Yes! ﻿We won! -Yes! Eighth final! ﻿Thank god! -We made history! ﻿Haifa! ﻿Yes! ﻿I can't believe it! ﻿Wow, can you hear it? ﻿The whole neighborhood! ﻿That's not a good idea, someone might call the police. ﻿No one will call, you coward, as if "they might"... ﻿Everyone is up. ﻿They probably think a missile fell here. ﻿Come on, light the Iranian. ﻿You think? I'm saving it for next week. ﻿We'll show those Englishmen how we do it in Haifa, ﻿We'll also shove some up their ass. ﻿Hi, my sweethearts, did you miss me? ﻿Me too. ﻿Sometimes there are weird comments, like, ﻿"How do you apply it?" ﻿"What side do you start with?" -Show us ﻿This show off. -Follow my steps. ﻿Ido, do you actually watch this crap? ﻿It has one hundred thousand views. ﻿And about 70 sponsors that pay her to advertise these things. ﻿And everyone who watches this is as weird as her. ﻿Probably some periphery girls that have nothing to do, ﻿I know many girls like that. ﻿Dana and her friends always make fun of them. ﻿She is not weird, -It is perfect ﻿Only if you know how to take it out. -She is nice. ﻿As if she's "nice" -And yes, the mascara helps. ﻿She is the popular girl, her boyfriend probably has a Vespa. ﻿OK come on, we have to get tickets. ﻿Of course, first thing tomorrow morning, ﻿Otherwise we'll get stuck outside with all the losers. ﻿Don't answer, I can't be bothered. ﻿OK, friends, I think we can all agree we had a great night, ﻿But I have to take Max back home. ﻿He likes to be at home by now. ﻿You are such a freak, Yoni. ﻿OK, I'll go as well, before my dad calls the police. ﻿Don't forget the money for the tickets, alright? ﻿I'm telling you, they probably have a problem on their website, ﻿Probably everyone try to get tickets. ﻿The website crashed. ﻿Should we try on your phone? ﻿Stop starring, it's embarrassing. ﻿One of the things Dana liked about me, ﻿Is apathy. ﻿Listen to Erez, be nonchalan. ﻿Nonchalant ﻿That too. ﻿Listen to that, ﻿I calculated Haifa's chances of winning. ﻿I weighed all the variables, ﻿Our physical inferiority, the weather, ﻿Our injuries and theirs, ﻿Yellow cards, red cards, previous games... ﻿And what did you get? ﻿We'll probably lose, they're better. ﻿Yoni, enough with your statistics! ﻿Ido, focus, look at me. ﻿We need to go buy tickets now. ﻿Now? -Yes, now! ﻿The website crashed I'm telling you, what don't you get? ﻿There's an early sale at the stadium, come on, let's go. ﻿What? but we have Chemistry. ﻿Ido, can you please buy one for me and I'll pay you tonight? ﻿Sure, I took my dad's credit card. ﻿Thanks Ido, you're the best, talk to you tonight. ﻿Yoni, ﻿If there is something in Chemistry that can blow up, ﻿Sit on it. ﻿Stop it, Erez. We rock! ﻿We got here first. ﻿Dude, ﻿3 tickets to the game, balcony 40. ﻿"Following the tension up north..." -Haifa against Liverpool? ﻿"Announced by the UEFA..." -They moved the game. ﻿What? -What? "That the return game ﻿Of Haifa and Liverpool, won't be held in Israel." ﻿"Due to the current security situation in Israel ﻿"UEFA decided that Maccabi Haifa won't be able ﻿"To host the eighth final of the Champions League ﻿"Against Liverpool in their home stadium ﻿"As a result, Haifa's fans ﻿will have to go to the neighboring Island, Cyprus." ﻿What the fuck, Cyprus? ﻿Why the hell Cyprus? ﻿Do you realize how big of a failure this is? ﻿We won't ever get to this stage again. ﻿It's a once in a lifetime game, and we’re missing it. ﻿Have they no shame in FIFA? ﻿UEFA. ﻿Don't start with me. ﻿What, don't we deserve a game in our country? ﻿Antisemitic. ﻿I actually think UEFA is right moving the game to Cyprus. ﻿What, you can't know what would happen. ﻿Imagine a missile falling on Liverpool. ﻿Yoni, shut up! Why are you always so reasonable? ﻿Doesn't your heart break? ﻿It does, really does. ﻿But this is life, friends. ﻿Wait a second, ﻿Maybe we can fly there? ﻿There are open skies or something, right? ﻿Flights are cheap for sure. ﻿I checked, 550 dollars each, port taxes excluded. ﻿Because of the game, prices are very high. ﻿We can sail there, Cyprus isn't that far away. ﻿Do you know how to sail a boat? ﻿Sure, I've been on boats my whole life. ﻿That's right, so... ﻿So you can sail a boat to Cyprus, right? ﻿Basically, yes... ﻿Why didn't you say so then? ﻿We have a captain, Yoni, Captain! ﻿I can seethe headlines on the Newspapers, in fact... ﻿In fact, who cares about the newspapers, well be on TV, prime time! ﻿Hello, Yonit, I'm here with one of ﻿Maccabi Haifa's top three fans, Ido Casspi... ﻿How did you come up with the crazy idea to sail to Cyprus? ﻿Erez, Erez, relax. ﻿What, why? It's a brilliant idea. ﻿OK, come on, I didn't really mean it. ﻿What? Why are you looking at me like this? ﻿I wasn't serious, It's a really bad idea. ﻿You're always doing this, always. ﻿Getting everyone on board, and then get cold feet. ﻿What are you afraid of? ﻿I'm not afraid, It's dangerous Erez, grow up! ﻿I don't want to grow up. ﻿We have a chance to do something big. We can see the game in Cyprus, why do you always give up? ﻿We don't have a boat, we have no idea how to get there, ﻿We have parents, coast guard, delicate security situation. ﻿It sound insignificant to me. You said it's possible before. ﻿Right, stupid idea, OK? ﻿Fine. Fine. ﻿You keep living your simple life, ﻿While Yoni and I make history, right Yoni? ﻿No... ﻿No thanks, I rather live. ﻿Live, Yoni? ﻿What kind of life is it, if you're afraid to live it? ﻿I disagree with you about it, ﻿But you made yourself very clear. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿At least Max understands me, Right, Max? ﻿Hi, my sweethearts, did you miss me? ﻿Me too. ﻿Today we'll take about eyelashes. ﻿First of all, because a perfect eyelash ﻿means you'll have a million-dollar looking face. ﻿And an eyelash that looks bad means... ﻿A bad looking face. ﻿You don't want a bad looking face, right? ﻿Get you nail polish out, ﻿Hide the Bamba, ﻿And follow my steps. ﻿I want to remind you ﻿That you can only get the best results ﻿Only with "Duckface" mascara by Papen ﻿That you get in a packet of three and a refill container. ﻿Because Papen, know what's best. Mom? ﻿What? ﻿What do you think about my look today? ﻿What do I think? You are the professional... ﻿What does it really matter? ﻿Hey. ﻿Sashken, ﻿You know that if you're tired of it, you can just stop. ﻿I just can't believe that this is what's happening. ﻿feel like I'm in a nightmare, ﻿And I can't wake up, as if "security situation"... ﻿Are you a little kid? You don't speak to me now? ﻿He asked me to let you know, you too are over. ﻿And that Maccabi Haifa won't forget, and won't forgive ﻿about you having a chance to be a part of a historical moment. ﻿Tell him already. ﻿And that you're a bad friend. ﻿But what can I do, we can't... ﻿We can't sail at sea... ﻿And even if I wanted, we can't... ﻿Ido, slap yourself in the face, and wake up. I'm Erez, ﻿Your best friend, ﻿Standing on the edge, ﻿Heartbroken, torn, ﻿And calling for help, ﻿And you have to only way to save me. ﻿Won't you save me? ﻿I'm calling out. ﻿Missile on Haifa, ﻿Hezbollah knows better than to take risks like that. ﻿Should I call my mom? What are we doing? ﻿Waiting for a missile to fall on the principal's room. ﻿"Siren practice, practice, practice". ﻿Yoni, relax, it's just practice... -"All the kids are asked to go ﻿to the designated shelters by classes." ﻿"Dear students, please act according to the procedures ﻿"listen to the teachers in each shelter ﻿"It's important to sit quietly, and wait for instructions ﻿"Reminder, grades 7, 8, and 9 go to the big shelter. ﻿"And grades 10 and 11 to the old shelter." -Don't get me wrong ﻿I'm still not speaking with you. ﻿It's final. ﻿Come on. ﻿Can you maybe move a little? ﻿Just a little, so I have a place to sit. ﻿Of course, Sasha. ﻿You live in the building opposite to me, right? ﻿I guess... ﻿I mean, I didn't really notice... ﻿I mean, I did notice, I didn't notice that... ﻿It's the opposite building. ﻿I mean, what do you call "the opposite building", ﻿depends on how you look at it. ﻿What's up Paruske? ﻿How's your weird vlog? Can you make me a sponsor? ﻿Sure, what do you want to advertise? ﻿Small sizes? high heels? ﻿What? ﻿Very funny, hilarious. ﻿Make some room. ﻿What does practice has to do with anything... ﻿Oh, god, it stinks in here. ﻿Didn't you hear about deodorant? ﻿Why did you sit with these weirdos out of all places... Wow, Sashush, I have to get the mascara you showed yesterday in the vlog. ﻿Do you have a sample? ﻿Of course I have. ﻿Just a moment. ﻿Hey Idodo, what's up? ﻿Should you be on a shift? ﻿I gave the cab to Moshe, ﻿He needed a favor from me. ﻿What is this mattress? What is it doing here? ﻿We'll sleep here in the lobby, ﻿Far from the windows, close to the shelter. ﻿At least a couple of days, until the situation calms down. ﻿Are you serious? ﻿I'm not sleeping here. ﻿I'm very serious. ﻿In the Gulf War mom and I also slept in the lobby. ﻿It saved us. ﻿Stop bringing her up ﻿Everytime you want something weird from me, dad. ﻿Ido, you sleep here, I don't care what you have to say. ﻿OK. ﻿Hey! where are you going? ﻿I don't care. ﻿As long as I'm not here with you. ﻿That is the situation, ﻿There are you and me, ﻿And in critical moments, I'm deciding and it's nonnegotiable. ﻿That's why you called us here? ﻿A raft? ﻿That is why I called you here, ﻿And that is how we get there. ﻿The Kon-Tiki was a raft some Norwegian built 70 years ago. ﻿And he sailed 8,000 kilometers with it, do you get that? ﻿Ido, let me get this straight. ﻿So you do want to sail to Cyprus to watch the game... ﻿Even though you said it was a stupid idea? ﻿And there is no way well survive, ﻿And we should stop thinking about it immediately. ﻿Yes. ﻿On a raft? -Yes! ﻿And you believe we'll get there, and that no one will die. ﻿Yes! ﻿You amaze me. ﻿I'm in, Dude. ﻿I'm not coming. ﻿Of course you're coming. ﻿Look, the distance to Cyprus is a total of 270 kilometers. ﻿I checked it yesterday, It would take us 35-40 hours, ﻿Depends on the wind. ﻿40 hours? ﻿Are you crazy? What about school? ﻿We go out Thursday night, we don't have school on Friday. ﻿Saturday we are in Nicosia, dude. ﻿You lost your mind, Ido, it's dangerous. ﻿It's dangerous here as well, no? ﻿The one who dares, wins Yoni. ﻿I'm not coming. You'll die for sure, it's crazy. ﻿That's also what Steve Jobs was told ﻿When he said he wants to sell computers. ﻿It's what Ronaldo was told when he said ﻿He'll win with Portugal in the EURO. ﻿It's what they said about Rabin when he said he'll make peace, dude. ﻿Rabin was murdered. ﻿Yoni, come on, that's not the point, Yoni we need you with us. ﻿I can plan a route, and take over the sailing. ﻿But I don't really know how to build this raft. ﻿You know what, forget it. ﻿OK? Forget it. ﻿Let's assume for a second you're coming, ﻿Just assume, theoretically. ﻿If you were coming, ﻿How would you build this raft? ﻿OK, its base can be built from the beams we have outside, but... ﻿The question is, what will your raft float on? ﻿We need something available, and light. ﻿And hollow. ﻿We pay back in community service, right? ﻿Sure, we'll pump water from the well, and fill their bottles. ﻿I'll stay and guard. ﻿"I'll stay and guard", "I'll stay and guard". ﻿Coward. ﻿OK, after we got the base ﻿We need strong rods that will support from underneath. ﻿And I know exactly where to get them. Wow, awesome. That's insane. Come on, let's load it. ﻿I'm guarding the door, OK? ﻿"I see green in my eyes... ﻿"And a mesmerizing and electrifying game ﻿"And a scissors kick goal... ﻿"Making the whole Carmel jump... ﻿"Haifa, Haifa, my Maccabi... ﻿"The green wave, wavy wave, high waves... ﻿"Haifa- Haifa- ﻿Kids, what are you doing there? ﻿Wait, wait, come on! ﻿We need to buy a simple steering wheel, mast, and sail. ﻿What's the problem? Well take some sheets, and have a sail. ﻿No, no, the sail should be from a strong and water repellent material. ﻿Otherwise, it will be too heavy. ﻿The seaweed smell is killing me. ﻿Are you coming or not? ﻿What? ﻿Nothing. ﻿I thought that... ﻿Your mom would probably prefer her name to be written on a sail and not ﻿As a memorial sign. ﻿You think so? ﻿Yes, dude. ﻿She would have understood us. ﻿You know, ﻿She insisted on coming here even when she was very sick, ﻿And couldn't sail. ﻿She would just come here to overlook the waves... ﻿She was the coolest mom I've met. ﻿Wait a second, I'll get the storeroom key. ﻿My dad must not see it. ﻿Why should we wait outside? ﻿Let's go upstairs, eat some pistachios. ﻿Watch some Premier league summaries. ﻿Get to know the enemy, you know... ﻿We can't, my dad decided we're sleeping in the living room. ﻿It's like we're on war alert. ﻿I think it's a great idea, I have to ask my parents to do that. ﻿He thinks he cares about me, he doesn't even know me. ﻿I can't wait for this sailing. ﻿It doesn't surprise me, Idodo. ﻿Just so you know, that in 90% of parent's death cases, ﻿Everything is undermined. ﻿You can say statistically, ﻿The family unit will never be the same again. ﻿Even if only one died, it feels like they both left. ﻿Don't feel bad. -Yoni, you're stupid. ﻿Ido, my brother, ﻿We have a couple of days to build this raft, ﻿And then nothing would matter anymore. ﻿Because we'll be on our way to Cyprus ﻿To watch the game of the century. ﻿Waves, fish, sun. ﻿It's going to be legendary, Ido! ﻿Hey. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I live here if you don't mind. ﻿The question is what are you doing here? ﻿I heard something about a raft, sailing. ﻿Are you going to go out to sea alone? ﻿Good story for the vlog. ﻿No, it's only them, I'm not coming with them. ﻿Yoni! -Yoni! ﻿Relax, it's for men, not for beauty queens. ﻿You don't want your nail to break. ﻿Come on, you rude boy, go pick on someone else. ﻿Do you even have a plan? ﻿Any of you did that before? ﻿Sure. Ido is a skipper and a captain. ﻿He could sail easily. ﻿Really? -Ouch... ﻿Well... Well, what do you think? ﻿We're just three kids, what sea, what shoes... ﻿Well, Paruske, it's late, go home, go pee and then go to sleep. ﻿When are you sailing? ﻿Sasha, to be honest this project, is pretty secretive... ﻿So we'd be glad if you won't tell to anyone about it. ﻿OK. ﻿Let's make a deal, ﻿I won't tell anyone anything, ﻿Even that you sail to Cyprus ﻿in a raft, ﻿If you'd let me film your project. ﻿What are you saying? ﻿That's blackmailing. ﻿OK, great, that's a deal. ﻿Ido, you can call me whenever you want. ﻿Can you believe it? ﻿The prettiest girl in school said you can call her. ﻿Come on, go get the key. ﻿Go, why are you looking at me? ﻿A little more. ﻿Now tie it. ﻿Wow... -Ido! ﻿Wow, wow! ﻿Wow, wow! -Wow! ﻿Well why are stressed? ﻿We only need a mast that can support the load of the wind, ﻿And not some rotten lamppost. That's all. ﻿Right? Ido, are you with me? ﻿What a shitty screw! ﻿Yoni, why won't you help? -Shhh... ﻿I told you there's no way, right? ﻿Breaking into school is a criminal offense. ﻿Corruption of property, and causing damage to the state symbols. ﻿I told the principal we'd ﻿Empty the trash bins until the end of the year. ﻿She didn't understand what I want, ﻿But it's an appropriate compensation, right? ﻿You should have suggested we'd clean the teachers' room as well. ﻿Symbolically, once a week. ﻿You're right, it's not enough, I’ll fix it. ﻿Hi, my sweethearts. -What is it? ﻿Long time no see. -Your Paruske again? ﻿But to make it up to you, we have a great item. ﻿I hope she won't say anything about the raft. -Ready? ﻿We have a special guest, ﻿Matania! ﻿Some of you know him from twelfth grade, ﻿Some from theater class. ﻿But most of you, know him from your dreams. ﻿Even if you never met him... ﻿Matania from high school is her boyfriend? ﻿He's dating divorced women, dude. ﻿I look good, I feel good, I'm ready. ﻿Come on girls. -You don't stand a chance, Ido. ﻿She doesn't have a boyfriend, I checked. Probably a cousin or something. ﻿Today Matania will help me teach you ﻿The different types of kissing. -Ido, did you invite her to the sailing? ﻿Dude, she's going to kiss him. ﻿As if she'd come to the sailing. ﻿She's not, she's just explaining. ﻿I call the first one, bird -Cousin, I'm telling you. ﻿And you want it to be short and perfect. ﻿Perfect classy lipstick by "Giclum" was made especially for these cases. ﻿Look how my lips responded well to the kiss. ﻿It's just a little kiss. ﻿Right, cousins do it sometimes. ﻿Let's move on to the next kiss, the soft one. ﻿He's not a cousin, my friend. He's her boyfriend. ﻿She kissed him now like you kiss a boyfriend, ﻿I know it, Dana and her kisses. -Erez, shut up! ﻿It doesn't mean anything Ido, you can't know. ﻿There are families like this, it happens. ﻿In the Russian culture you can't really know. ﻿And let's finish off, with the french. ﻿This kiss can only have one lipstick... ﻿"Pure color envy shine", ﻿No french kiss can face it. ﻿There's a reason to save the best for last. ﻿Look at Matania's lips this time. ﻿I told you we can't trust her, right? ﻿Girls, girls, hornet's nest, that's what I always say. ﻿She didn't understand anything about football anyway. ﻿What is it Ido? ﻿Did she break your heart to pieces? ﻿Do you want a friend's advice? ﻿The best thing to do is forget about her and focus on the game. ﻿We'll assemble the mast, goodbye, all the best, Sasha, your dad... ﻿They can all look for us. ﻿We're in Cyprus, drinking Ouzo with Abu Fani. ﻿Erez, come on, can't you see he's devastated? ﻿Erez is right. ﻿Really? ﻿We don't have time to waste. -What? ﻿We have to finish building in two days and head out. ﻿There is still a matter we haven't discussed. ﻿Come on, talk already Yoni, come on. ﻿OK. ﻿You need to find excuses to tell your parents. ﻿Of course we need. ﻿Ido will say he's sleeping over at mine and I'm at his. We talked about it already. ﻿Two nights? ﻿Yes, my parents don't know when I'm home anyway, ﻿There won't be a problem. ﻿But what if there will be? ﻿Do exactly as I say. ﻿Ido, talk to your dad when he's reading his newspaper. ﻿That's when he's not focused. ﻿Wait for the right opportunity, and then ask him. ﻿Dad, I'll be sleeping over at Erez's tomorrow, OK? ﻿Erez, you go to your mom when she's in the bathroom. ﻿And I'll stay also on Friday because we have homework in history. ﻿Come on, no missiles are falling at the moment. ﻿Wait, did you say "great" ﻿That will keep them calm until Friday night, best case scenario, OK? ﻿But what if they find out before? ﻿What are you suggesting? ﻿Leave traces on your computer, like you went to Eilat. ﻿The most important thing, leave your browser open. ﻿Mom, Erez is planning on going to Eilat. ﻿Inbal, are you stupid? I'm not going anywhere. ﻿Shut up! Shut up! ﻿Regarding leaving the country, ﻿Once you leave Israel's territorial waters, ﻿Coast guard will notice you ﻿Put in the frequency I wrote in the note. ﻿And give them the name written there. ﻿That's a name of a yacht that already got a leave pass. ﻿Memorize it, and then swallow it. ﻿Just so you know Yoni, ﻿That at some point you can be awesome. ﻿It's still early, ﻿But it's getting closer. ﻿Sleep well, friends. ﻿Tomorrow night we go out to sea. ﻿You go out to sea. ﻿Come on, can you believe what we built here? ﻿Crazy. ﻿I always felt like chlorine, and I had a connection ﻿Like it's meant to be, I always love this Chlorine. ﻿OK, friends, see you in a couple of hours. ﻿I'm going to raid my mom's kitchen ﻿We just got delivery from the supermarket. ﻿Ido, don't turn around, I think someone is looking for you. ﻿Well, maybe she'll just pass us by and won't stop, don't panic. ﻿Stay cool. ﻿Hi, Sasha. ﻿I tried calling you a couple of times, is your phone OK? ﻿Yes, totally OK. ﻿And how is it raft building going? I wanted to stop by and film a little. There's no raft building, we decided to stop it. ﻿Really? ﻿OK, so you're not going to the game? ﻿No, no, I don't think so. ﻿Come on, Ido, let's go. ﻿Bye, Paruske. ﻿OK, I got a list, we can start loading. ﻿Mattress? ﻿Yes. ﻿Blanket? ﻿Yes. ﻿Candy? ﻿Yes. ﻿Sleeping bag? ﻿Yes. ﻿More candy? ﻿Yes. ﻿I see you brought a barometer. ﻿It can't hurt. ﻿I think it has more use here than in the house on the wall. ﻿Great, did you get your mom's GPS? ﻿Of course, I already marked the route, ﻿Look. ﻿The green, is the route we want. ﻿It's pretty much on the course straight to Cyprus. ﻿The red is in case we get blown off course with the winds. ﻿It'll also get us to Cyprus, but it's 40 kilometers longer. ﻿Is someone going to help me? ﻿Didn't we say we take only the necessities? ﻿Yes, that's the necessities. ﻿Take it. ﻿Erez, give me drum rolls. ﻿Come on, we can head out. ﻿Let's take it to the water. ﻿It's not too late to regret, Ido. ﻿You're going to regret Yoni, your whole life. ﻿It's your last chance, are you coming? ﻿Now that I see this raft, I want to a little bit, but... ﻿I rather live. ﻿Thank you for everything. ﻿Come on, let's get it in. ﻿Let me, I'll help. ﻿Be careful. ﻿And stick to the GPS. ﻿Watch your hand. ﻿OK, close it. ﻿Yoni, ﻿Take Max out so we can say bye. ﻿Good idea. ﻿Are you looking for something? Max! Max! ﻿Ido, come back. We can't. ﻿Don't worry, he'll be fine. Max! Max! Max! ﻿Fuck, Ugh! ﻿Max, Max. ﻿Move. ﻿Max... ﻿What.. ﻿What did you think? I could die. ﻿Stop, but you're not dead, right? ﻿Just a little wet. ﻿Let's get it up. ﻿Pull. ﻿I'll call mom to take me from here. ﻿What, Yoni, no, it'll ruin everything. ﻿Shit, I can't believe it. ﻿The phone is dead. ﻿Great Erez, you ruined my phone. ﻿Ido, I need to make an urgent call. ﻿What? ﻿We left the SIM at the hangar. ﻿What? -It was your idea. ﻿You said that way no one can find us. ﻿I said take it out, not leave it on land. ﻿We need to call help, how will we do it? ﻿We can die, and no one will... -OK, stop maybe? ﻿The raft's OK, the wind is pulling us forward. ﻿And in two days we're at the fucking stadium, ﻿Giving Mabouka a kiss on the forehead. ﻿That our moment, Yoni. ﻿We're here and well succeed, and you'll be a part of it. ﻿I know you're worried, I know. ﻿But Ido and I got this, right Ido? ﻿Right? ﻿Totally Yoni, we got this. ﻿I'm getting in the tent to dry my phone. ﻿What happened? ﻿Surprise. ﻿What is she... What are you doing here? ﻿Yoni invited me. -What? -What? ﻿He left me a message on the feed that you go out tonight, ﻿And said it would be nice if I'd come. ﻿What? No... ﻿I said it would be nice if you'd come to the hangar ﻿To document the departure. ﻿I didn't mean you'd actually join them. ﻿I don't know if it really matters, ﻿But I'm on the raft, and we can't go back. ﻿It's possible, 15 minutes and you're on shore. ﻿I thought you'd be happy if I joined. ﻿That was before you fooled around with your boyfriend on the vlog. ﻿What?

Are you stupid? ﻿Do you see what happened 'cause of your pills? ﻿We're almost in Lebanon. ﻿Can you relax? ﻿I meant well, I thought it could help seasickness. ﻿It's getting closer. -It affected us that way ﻿Just because we're kids or something. ﻿Oh no, we're going to die. ﻿Or they'll take us captive. ﻿What do you think you're doing, give me that. -What? ﻿It'll take us forever, it's a motorboat, it'll get here in seconds. ﻿You made enough damage, the both of you. ﻿OK, Ido it's not our fault. ﻿It is. ﻿If we're speaking, Yoni, you fell asleep on the steering wheel. ﻿You suppose to be the navigator, ﻿And not find out now we're almost in Lebanon. ﻿Because I can't be in charge of everything. ﻿Are you a little child? Be responsible. ﻿Yes, I'm a little kid. ﻿And I didn't even want to be here from the start. ﻿Besides, you're the captain, you sail this boat, ﻿So you have no right to yell at me. ﻿Oh, right. ﻿I forgot you're a coward, ﻿Prefer stay at home with your snacks, and computer ﻿Than do something with your pathetic life. ﻿-Ido. ﻿Don't talk Hebrew, I'm on it. ﻿Hello, friend, ﻿Do you know Arabic? -Shhh... ﻿My grandma is from Tunisia.

I went into her room this morning, ﻿I saw it on her vlog. ﻿She told me she's going to sleepover at her friend's house, Gaya. ﻿But it turns out she never got to Gaya's, I checked. ﻿And then I saw your son's name. Ido slept at Ido's last night. ﻿It probably an old video or something. ﻿Oh, ﻿Sure, and old video, what was I thinking? ﻿Can you please focus? ﻿Tell me, am I... ﻿One of these moms that can't even press play? ﻿This video is from last night, ﻿Your son has something to do with that, please... ﻿Help me figure out what's going on here. ﻿Hey, you've reached Ido ﻿I can't talk right now, please live a message. ﻿Hello? -Hello? ﻿Lital? -Yes. ﻿Hi, hello, it's Reuven, Ido's dad. ﻿Hi, Reuven. -What's up? ﻿Fine. ﻿Ido slept at your place tonight, right? ﻿No, he slept at Yoni's. ﻿At Yoni's? ﻿Ugh, It's disgusting... ﻿Why is everyone saying it? ﻿He's not disgusting, you don't even know him. ﻿It's a mouse. ﻿So what? ﻿Just so you know, he's very smart. ﻿You can pet him. ﻿Don't be afraid. ﻿He likes it. ﻿Hey... ﻿It's soft. ﻿I feel his pulse, do you feel it? ﻿Yes, it's because he's afraid of you. ﻿But it's not because he's a coward, ﻿It's just... ﻿Everyone is so much bigger than him, and... ﻿And stronger. ﻿Think about how many things can happen to him. ﻿That's why he feels the safest in his cage. ﻿Are you ready for the frog man? ﻿What? ﻿Laugh all you want, this is how a true Navy warrior looks like. ﻿You think he'll catch something? ﻿Let's hope he can even get himself out of there. ﻿How can he hold his breath like this? ﻿He's from Tunisia. ﻿Is he diving in Haifa as well? ﻿Not really. ﻿He's so stupid. I'm going in. ﻿Oh my god! He did it. ﻿Did you get the knife ready? ﻿What did I tell you? ﻿Look at the best Jaffa cod you'll ever eat. ﻿I could only catch two, the third got away. ﻿But there's enough for everybody. ﻿Messi or Ronaldo? ﻿The simplest, and most difficult question in history. ﻿In terms of physical data and statistics, ﻿And goals per minute, Ronaldo is slightly better. ﻿But if you take in popularity, game style, and incidence of injuries, ﻿Dribble and style, Messi. ﻿Do you think they're looking for us already? ﻿According to his computer history, he's probably in Eilat. ﻿Ido looked for a bus to Eilat, and ordered a hostel room in Eilat. ﻿And his friend, Erez, found out where they broadcast the game. ﻿So why aren't they in the hostel? ﻿According to the video you showed me, ﻿they probably decided to camp eventually. ﻿Something isn't right... ﻿How come everybody isn't answering their phones? ﻿Probably don't want to talk to you right now. ﻿Excuse me, maybe something happened at home? ﻿Did you have a fight with Ido? ﻿Did you hurt him? ﻿It's written here that your wife passed away two years ago. ﻿It hasn't even been 24 hours guys. ﻿It might not be nice... ﻿But it's not the end of the world. ﻿Yes, maybe... ﻿Maybe they're really in Eilat. ﻿Would you like to tell me where did you learn how to sail? ﻿We had a sailboat in the marina, and we used to sail it on Saturdays. ﻿It's not that complicated. ﻿Want to try? ﻿Of course. ﻿OK, hold it here. ﻿Nice. ﻿There isn't much of a wind right now, ﻿So we keep course, a straight line. ﻿That is actually the coolest thing about the sea, ﻿You don't need to think too much, ﻿Just open the sail, ﻿And sail away... ﻿I love this feeling, ﻿This freedom- ﻿What? ﻿You know... ﻿You're prettier that way, ﻿No makeup, or hair done... ﻿Natural. ﻿Natural, right? ﻿Don't you think? ﻿Anyway, what's the point of all the makeup? ﻿I think it's some kind of a mask. ﻿Some kind of a lie, in my opinion. ﻿Everything is a mask. ﻿Do you think you don't have a mask because you don't wear makeup? ﻿You wear indeed. ﻿You wear a mask at school, ﻿And you put another mask at home, ﻿And another mask when you're with friends, ﻿Don't you think? ﻿Fine. ﻿If makeup is so great, ﻿Why don't you like it as much anymore? ﻿I probably had enough of it. ﻿The beauty. ﻿But what if I don't know what my truth is? ﻿What if I don't have anything to say? ﻿You'll have. ﻿You'll find. ﻿How do you know? ﻿I can see. ﻿I'm sorry, I... ﻿I thought that... ﻿It's not you, my stomach... ﻿It doesn't add up... ﻿Why would Yoni join them? ﻿The kid is still sleeping with the lighten. ﻿Would you like sugar? ﻿I'm whispering in the meantime, until I get out of... ﻿Maybe you should guess where I am. ﻿Here are some clues. ﻿Here are a few clues. ﻿No! ﻿Yoni? ﻿Yoni, can you cover for... ﻿It's probably the fish we ate tonight. ﻿Yoni, ﻿I'm sorry about what I said this morning. ﻿Thank you for Sasha. ﻿Who's available in Moria 52? ﻿Arrives at Nesher in 30 minutes, who's taking it? ﻿Taxi, why don't you answer? ﻿Many rides are coming, please take them. ﻿I don't get it. ﻿Why would someone do that, steal a memorial sign, ﻿What is up with people? ﻿Have you lost a boat? ﻿What? No, why would a boat go missing? ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Of course, I'd know if a boat went missing. ﻿You know we keep it all organized, ﻿We count the boats every morning before we go out to sea. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿We said we have to save water? ﻿Ido, maybe we should go back? ﻿Think about it, we're sick, we're going to run out of water soon ﻿And it's not going to end well. ﻿Truth is, Voni, ﻿We're closer to Cyprus, ﻿Our best chance it going forward. ﻿"Shimshon supermarket"? ﻿Did you skewer fish from the supermarket? ﻿What? ﻿Are you insane? ﻿There is not problem with these fish. ﻿So I got them at the supermarket, so what? ﻿They were still fresh. ﻿It's... It's because we ate them with Bamba, ﻿Who... who eats fish with Bamba? ﻿Erez, rotten fish are dangerous, ﻿Especially in these conditions. ﻿The chances of getting sick are really, really... ﻿Shut up, no one invited you... ﻿You shut up. ﻿Right now she's more helpful than you... ﻿Surprise, surprise, Ido's on the prince's side again... ﻿Since she got here, it's like I can't talk to you. ﻿Because someone here is trying to be responsible. ﻿Erez, enough, we can't trust you. ﻿You screwing up all the time, lying, doing nonsense. ﻿I'm sure you didn't understand a word the fisherman said. ﻿Really? ﻿Who are you? ﻿I'm don't recognize you anymore... ﻿Is it Ido? ﻿The same Ido I know since I was 6 years old? ﻿That I saved his ass maybe a 100 times from teachers, ﻿And all kinds of shit with my nonsense? ﻿You can't trust me, aren't you ashamed? ﻿Did you forget who was there for you after the Shivah? ﻿Where you slept. ﻿You could barely speak, you just kept crying for a month! ﻿Ido, enough! ﻿Stop lying to everyone! -Stop! ﻿Enough! -Stop it! ﻿You don't know how to be a friend. ﻿Erez, enough. Erez, Erez, stop! ﻿Erez. -Leave me alone! ﻿Erez! ﻿What was it? ﻿Even though there is no reason to believe ﻿That your kids are at sea, ﻿We contacted Cyprus police. ﻿If something will come up, we'll let you know. We can't be patient. ﻿Something may have happened already. ﻿They need us right now! ﻿Sir, you don't need to raise your voice. ﻿We'll keep in touch. ﻿He hung up. ﻿Do you really think something happened to them? ﻿Who's available in Balfour? Who's available in Balfour? ﻿I don't know. ﻿They've been at sea for 30 hours, that's a long time. ﻿He took a Walkie Talkie with him for sure. ﻿How haven't I thought of it before? ﻿Are you sure it can stand it? ﻿Yes, It's not really a storm. ﻿Maybe we should fold a sail? ﻿It'll be OK, as long as we're on the green course. ﻿We're not really on the green course. ﻿Sasha! ﻿Can you tighten the rope there? ﻿Sasha! ﻿Yoni! get the life jacket! ﻿Ido, she's drifting! ﻿Sasha, I'm coming! -Ido! ﻿Get it here already! ﻿Sasha, I'm coming! ﻿Sasha, hang in there! ﻿Pull it! ﻿Come on, Yoni! ﻿Erez, take this. ﻿I'll be fine without it. ﻿It's fine. ﻿Ido, is there a chance my SIM didn't get wet? ﻿Shit. ﻿Let's try anyway. ﻿There is a distress frequency at sea. ﻿If Ido has a connection, he'll hear us at some point. ﻿Ido, do you copy? ﻿Ido? ﻿Erez, Yoni, Sasha. ﻿Hold the tent tightly! ﻿What was it? ﻿Close it, Ido! ﻿The sail, we have to take it down. ﻿Going out there would be suicide. ﻿agree with Yoni. ﻿Do we have any other choice? ﻿The raft can't be navigated, ﻿And there's a chance that because of the wind the mast will collapse... ﻿And then we're screwed. ﻿OK, Erez, ﻿Let's go outside and try to take the sail down. ﻿We need another hand there, I think we can do it together. ﻿No way, the only way I'm going out of here is in a coffin. ﻿I'll do it. ﻿Very well, Sasha. ﻿Yoni, learn from her. ﻿Ready? ﻿Move from there, so you won't fall. ﻿Get that rope. ﻿OK. ﻿No! -What should we do, Ido? ﻿Erez, go help her. ﻿When I pull here, let go. ﻿Pull hard! ﻿It won't come loose, Ido! ﻿Watch out, It's falling! ﻿What happened to her? ﻿Look at me. ﻿It's nothing. ﻿Just a small bump. ﻿What is it? It can't be taken down. ﻿We have to. ﻿It's either the sail or us. ﻿Take a breath. ﻿Sorry about the fish, bro! ﻿You're crazy. ﻿Ready? ﻿I was born ready for god's sake! ﻿Get on my shoulders. ﻿Yes! ﻿Yes, dude, we did it! ﻿Ido, I can't see anything! -Yoni!
