Someone with your scent... Jin Yi... Hi there. Ran Makeup Salon The audition I'll be participating on this time is for an action film set in Korea under the Japanese rule. Since the character is so called a modern boy, I need to look classic and traditional, but also dandy and sexy, fantastic and... You don't need a mirror. Use your senses. You can do it. Can you do it? What? She must have fallen for me. Oh, I am in trouble. I haven't had a customer in a while. Gather yourself. There's no mirror here. You can do it! North town style or south town style? What? How could you do a modern boy without knowing that? World class dancer Choi Seung Hui... One of the earliest aviators, Park Kyung Won. Fashionista, Na Hye Seok, they were wild about my makeup skills. Countless modern girls and modern boys lined up to get my touch before their dates. As I expected, my skills won't fail me. With a look like this, he can dominate the dance hall. Not enough. I can do better. A... E... I... O... If it is the way to be with you till eternity... Is it this way... to be with you till eternity? What are you doing here?! I mean... This is my customer. But come to think of it... Whatever I do here, doesn't concern you. Mom, it's not that— Mom? Mother? Huh? So Nyeon, you told me you're going for real estate shopping! I've sent you to a bigger land... to study land and property... And you came back in just six months filled with vain dreams! Oh. Unbelievable. Sorry, everyone. I need to attend an audition. Goodbye. This is exactly why I didn't want to buy a building with a makeup shop. Let's be honest here. If someone you love and care for would stay away from all the lucky gold key cards and pick a losing card... If he throws away the chance to land on a good property and instead get a go to jail card... Could you just stand there and do nothing?! Let me be straightforward. Don't do makeup for So Nyeon! Well, he is my customer after all. And with the rent increase... Fine. I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse. If my boy So Nyeon comes back with the pretty face that resembles mine with makeup, reject him firmly. Every time you do that, I'll deduct the amount from your rent. From the rent? He didn't pay today. It's $15.00. What?! But it said $10.00 on the board. It's $15.00 Full makeup $15.00 Lee So Nyeon. It's your turn. Yup! Keep Calm and Fire Safety On Makeup: Sale at 50% Off Research-backed period makeup possible Boss Ran! Look. Here, here, here. Rent Increase: 300% From the New Owner It's triple the rent. It means she wants me out, isn't it? I worked so hard for the last thirty years, but I got no money. Thirty years... I've been doing it for five hundred years but I still don't know. Five hundred years? You crazy pretty thing. That's right. A little madness is a necessity. Oh, it's cold. How come you're so cold? I told you not to be picky about food. Boss Ran, How long has it been, since you first came to my shop? It's been twenty years already? How come you haven't aged a bit? You're a baby face among the baby faces. You're the pride of our town. A never dying beauty. Cheers to Ran Makeup Salon! Drink up, it's on me today. I'd rather die while eating than die of hunger. I might just go out and kill myself. It could be one way out if you could die. I live, because I have none. I'm not usually the type to walk away without paying. Here. Don't say no. Your hands are... I mean the wind is cold. Shall we go for mille feuille hot pot? (Napoleon custard slice) Earlier today, your mom— Don't speak. Don't. I know your feeling. I'll allow you... A kiss. It's not too late... to turn me into one of you. You might actually die. I might not be able to restrain myself. I promised not to do your makeup. So don't come again. What was that earlier this afternoon? You were just about to kiss me right before my mom came in. Be quiet, you're distracting me. You were just about to kiss me, weren't you? What are you? I am Lee So Nyeon. Do you know how much your smell stimulates me? Even in this very moment, I am fighting with my own desire to bite you. W-What are you... I h-have to tell you, that earlier was my first kiss. How come a boy like you has a scent of Jin Yi. Jin Yi. Is that you? Is your soul trapped in this boy's body? Huh? Who's Jin Yi? It can't be. Reincarnation is what foolish mortals believe. Go away, So Nyeon. I have no more energy left to deal with you. Lee Son Yeon! I know you're in there. Get out. If she finds out, I am just as dead. Help me, please. If she finds out that I hid you, she will kick me out. Please. Please. What is this? I definitely saw him. That building is out in the market? Now? Okay I'll be there. I'll be back. Thank you. Chapter 3 Is My Heart Broken? How could I... For a young boy who's still wet behind the ears? My heart might be literally broken. I've been using it for too long. No way. There must be a way. He must be a reincarnation of Jin Yi or her descendant. How could I find out? Book Title: Learning Universe through Reincarnation I mean... Your hand was cold. And I wanted to thank you for yesterday. Let's go somewhere. On a date? Shall we go for carbonara? May I have a moment? I am in need of a blood, so if you may, could you share with me a bit of his blood? What are you talking about? Are you saying no? I am asking you politely. Of course. It's not even your blood. I am not asking for money, or asking all of his blood. Just a little bit of what you took from him. Why not? I even brought a container. Just a little— You need my blood? Why? Oh, it's... I should've known with your pale skin and cold hands. Is that because of nose bleeding? You had that yesterday, too. What's your diagnosis? Are you dying? Then maybe... Let's go to the hospital. I'll pay the bills. I am the landlord's son. So you don't have terminal illness. Are you sure? I can't have terminal illness. Hwang Jin Yi Show! What did you say your last name was? Lee. How about your mom? Kang. Why? Is there any Hwang in your family? Any of your grandparents? Hwang? I wouldn't know... Oh, what's your last name? Bring me a document of your family tree next time. Wait, she couldn't be in the document. She wasn't respected in her lifetime. Who would put her in. Who is Jin Yi whom you've mentioned yesterday? Hwang Jin Yi. Hwang Jin Yi? Hwang Jin Yi from the Hwang Jin Yi Show? A virtuoso. She's not just a virtuoso but an extraordinary one. She's not someone a boy like you could easily mention. A what? Does it mean her lover works at Hwang Jin Yi Show? It's okay, it's okay, because I am handsome. It's okay. Yes, I can do it! ♪ Do it, do it Wait for me. There must be a way. She's just a tenant. I should be able to kick her out. Ran Makeup Salon... Ran Makeup Salon... Resident Registration Number 1957, December— 19...? The year of the chicken? With a skin like that, she can't be born in 1957. Something's not right. Something's odd. Let me check again. Fifty-seven? He has a nice face and the right height. He's got the looks for the role. Shush If he is indeed Jin Yi's descendant, he should have her talent. "Ah, dear Juliet." "Why art thou yet so fair? "Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous." "And that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in the dark to be his paramour?" Here in the dark to be his paramour?" "Eyes, look your last!" "Arms, take your last embrace!" " And lips... "Oh, you, the doors of breath..." Don't come, don't come. "Seal with a righteous kiss." Go away, go away. "A dateless bargain, to engrossing death." Let's see. The place looks smaller than it should be. Oh, my! It's not my size. Something's fishy here. Wait, what's that? What? She re-modeled the place without my permission? Splendid job at restraining yourself, Ran. It was the biggest crisis in five hundred years of my vampire life. Jin Yi, I'm truly sorry. It was a big misunderstanding, to mistake you for such a terrible actor. No, no way. You came here to see me! Here's the thing. My gut tells me I got this: I am the king of the world. My gut is telling me, too. I might just be able to die this time... of embarrassment... Wait for me! Are you worried that I'll become a star overnight? Don't worry. No need to worry too much. Even if that happens, I won't leave you. I am not that kind of person. Trust me. Trust— Excuse me. Do we take out recycles on Tuesdays and Thursdays? They don't seem to be recyclables. I... I have another audition tomorrow. Growl! A vampire. Vampires don't growl. Did something happen, while you were in the west? What should I do if they both offer me a role? Romeo or Vampire? That is the question. Well, I believe your worries are not necessary. Oh, well. Boy, be ambitious. Of course, be ambitious. Wait for me, once! Chapter 4 Dangerous Feelings No. Nope. No, that's not right. Why? What's not right? A vampire is enough. It's hard to portray a being that doesn't exist... You know? You asked about Jin Yi before. Jin Yi was a true virtuoso. V.i.r.t.u.o.s.o, virtuoso, an artist. One of Jin Yi's many talents was finding beauty in almost anything in the world. When I first changed into... When I was scared and lonely... She was the only person who opened up to me. It was Jin Yi. Try it, it's okay. If it weren't for Jin Yi, I could've turned into something quite different. Vampire, in your thoughts are the horrible creatures who suck human blood. Your mind is blind to their unbearable sense of alienation, their pain of enduring eternal solitude. Give me another chance. I want to do it right. I really want to do it right this time. It's not it. - What? - Your role... It's not as a vampire but a boy who lives next to a vampire girl. A fifteen-year old boy who lives next door to a vampire girl. A makeup salon without a mirror... Go. Go away. Go away! Oh, it's spicy. An unbelievable babyface. Bloody red drink. Fridge full of sunscreen. And the power... I can't be wrong. Just say what you want to say, as if you are that boy. My friend is a vampire. I want to go away with her. My dear friend is a vampire. I want to go away with her. I... want to be with you. It's not too late. Turn me into one of you. Please. It's my last wish. It's dangerous. It hurts. Stop. You might actually die. I might not be able to resist myself. No. Help me, please. Hello. Hi, hi. Yes, I am on my— Omo, omo! Boss Ran! Chapter 5 ... A bite doesn't seem to change me. Would it? A... E... I... O... I'm sorry. I was... How long has it been? Since you've become a vampire? You noticed. Come to think of it, it's rather strange that I didn't notice before. Is it? I thought I was in a perfect disguise. Oh, is that what you call a perfect disguise? Five hundred years. What? You asked how long I've been a vampire. It's been five hundred years. You mean... There's 480 years gap between... Hello, Ma'am. Grandma? To be precise, there's 499 years difference between us. I turned into a vampire when I was nineteen years old. N-Nineteen? N-Nineteen? I want to trust you but... You don't look nineteen. Or did people from those days get older faster? I'll bite you again if I have to. Okay, bite me. Here, here, bite me. Lee So Nyeon! What are you doing here again?! How about you, Mom? Dear Mother. (Said with respect) I said no. Why are you so uncooperative?! Ma'am! (Said with respect) Just once, a little bit. - Don't say, you know it, too, Mom? - Don't say, you know it, too? What? You tell me first, Mom. What? What do you know? Yes. I am a vampire. - Hey, hey. - Mom, Mom. Mom. Don't kick her out. What? M-Mom... Have you ever thought of how terrifying it would be to live as a vampire? You assume that they are horrible just because they are different. Living in a place where no one understands you, where there's no one to talk to, and you can't speak the language, everyone ignores you, and teases you for not being fluent in their language, discriminate you for your skin color. Mom, you know nothing! Are we still talking about her? It's okay to be a vampire. So... don't go. I am not going anywhere. I never said I would kick her out. What? On that day. At that time. With garlics, silver, and the cross, I will get rid of the devil vampire. Only for the good of the community, and the stabilization of property prices. Vampires out! Vampires out— What? Among all the places, why here? This is my building, too. Oh, it's cold. What am I going to do? The way of the landlord is high and steep. Let me see. Okay, what's going to happen? What if she burns like hell and burn the whole building? Was it a mistake to bring her back in? Look at the amazing skin revitalization! Don't even think of attacking me. I have this garlic. C-Cross, c-cross. Where is my cross? Cross! Even the silver... Here... None of those work. I won't hurt you. Just be quiet. I... I want to be a vampire, too. Please, turn me into one, Ma'am. A vampire. So... Have you had a chance to think? You really want to be a vampire? Even if you have to wander around in eternity as a being that's neither living nor dead? Yes, I mean it. I want to live for eternity. Bite me, bite me. Even if you might end up hurting everyone you love, everyone you care for? You know how sad it is to live as a human? Our life is so short we die before our buildings decay. How useless you feel, when you know for sure your one and only flesh and blood will definitely waste your fortune if I pass it onto him. Mom, I'm here. I can hear you. I will cut the rent. Rent? No. No? Not just me. The butcher shop, too. While you're at it, cut the rent for everybody or not. No. Just one day, give me one day to think. Okay, it seems everything's settled. Let's wrap up for today. Let's go, Mom. Hurry up! What's that look on your face? You like me, don't you? You might end up hurting everyone you love, everyone you care for. What is it? You hurt me, right? You like me. No, that was because you have the scent of Jin Yi. Even my mom found out about you. You didn't even think of leaving. Because you want to be around me. It's not true. It's because of the rent and deposits and all. By keeping this necklace, I thought I was keeping her with me forever. How foolish I was. That... is your blood. You don't have to keep me like this. I am right here. Thank you for not dying on me. I am a vampire. I am a vampire who lived in this place for five hundred years. But there are many things I still don't know.
