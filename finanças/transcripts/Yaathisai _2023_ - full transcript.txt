Kings conducted all the wars only to retain their AUTHORITY. To proceed with them, they needed many mere names... Land... People... Virtue... Rights... 'AUTHORITY' is the only basis of any reign. 'AUTHORITY' Is my father Ranadheeran that GREAT a WARRIOR? Yes... BY ALL MEANS, he is INVINCIBLE. Not only his prowess is the reason behind Ranadheeran's victories... He had unfailing clans backing him up. Remarkably the PERUMPALLY clan. In every traumatic situation Perumpally stood with Pandiyas. Did Ranadheeran had ever feared? I will tell you a story... YAATHISAI (southern India) had never loved to be in peace. During the reign of, Ranadheeran’s father Arikesari, war between Cheras, Chola and Pandiyas recommenced again. the war hadn’t seized within days or months. After every setback, the Chera troops relentlessly invaded back. Time rolled on, and so as the war. Arikesari’s age confined him within the walls of the castle. Ranadheeran started to head the Pandiyan troops. Cheran assumed that this is the right time to vanquish Pandiyas. They asked the help of Cholas. With the Cholas, Kongu, Karnataka, six Velir clans, and ten other small clans, stood against Pandiyas. our Einar clan is one among them. History might be misjudged that this shall terminate the Pandiyan era. BUT… Pandiyas were headed by RANADHEERAN. That day Yaathisai had nothing else other than the slaughtered bodies. Even the wind blown there had the strong metallic blood stink. Ranadheeran deported the defeated Cheras as slaves to the Arabs. The lost Cholas lurked into the woods. Pandiyas took over the complete control of the Southern region. They made the Cholan castle as their northern territory. Ranadheeran enthroned himself in the Cholan castle and started to rule. The clash between the empires will vanish the smaller clans involved. The groups who evaded became nomads or refugees. Many Velir clans lost their independence in that war. Many smaller clans disappeared without leftovers. Our clan was chased to drylands. We couldn’t cultivate, and so we became fragile. Earlier we ran iron factories, who were then pushed back to hunt with stones. But nature’s law was CLUELESS. When even Emperors feared of Ranadheeran, Nature EVOLVED a Great Warrior against Ranadheeran. KOTHI was born amidst the raising temperatures of the drylands. 25 years through, Kothi unfolded himself as an Alpha male. He recalled Ranadheeran daily, whom he hadn't even met yet. The deserted drylands gave Kothi the desire to own the Scepter. That desire empowered him to stand against Ranadheeran. This happened before 15 years. KOTHI'S DESIRE, made him spot the Cholan bunkers which couldn’t be hinted by Pandiyas for years. KOTHI'S DESIRE, is going to kill numerous common lives again. KOTHI'S DESIRE, is going to put Yaathisai into blood again. "Cholan bunkers" How did you trace the Cholan footprints? Salutes to the hero of 100 battlegrounds. Message? To recover the Cholan lands from Pandiyas, to help Cholas, Einars are all set. Cholas aren’t. During the Chera war against Pandiyans, The Chola dynasty got collapsed. Our last hope is the 4-year-old Cholan prince Nalan. His safety is predominant for us. For the next 15 years, tiger won’t plunge. Then, we will regain everything. Your gain? My clan’s Independence. Within a year, Einars will offer back the castle to Cholas. In turn, Einars will have a separate kingdom. and Cholas should accredit it. We should be liberated from paying our taxes. Our land should be regained. DARING… But, A small squad can’t defeat Pandiyas. Little drops make the mighty ocean. Once the castle is captured, I need 20 thousand Cholan troops to withstand. I should be permitted to use the Cholan flag. The castle will fall in a year. Hit a Try. “A small squad can’t defeat Pandiyas.” “YAATHISAI” "Einar region" Ey... Fight me. No leader on the battleground, Elite is the leader. Next? You Fight me. Why? Leave off to your home with success. Don’t restrain your valor within him. Fight me, Come... Don’t inflict your leadership obsession into me. I gave up... I gave up only for you. Are we going to invade? Are we? My SON will be a born KING. You don't overthink. Be at peace. Make sure the new arrival is a BOY. Let the words of the priest become true. "Arabian sea, 3500 miles away. West of Pandiyan country." (ARABIC): Ey... Ey... Ey... Ey... After 25 years you are returning to your motherland... can you feel the warmth of it? What kind of people are you? Why did Ranadheera Pandiyan want to maintain you for these many years? And why did he want you back alive? What is your frame of mind? Who’s your hope to hold your life so long? May peace come to you soon. “Karuvaiyur: Pandiyan territory.” [MUSIC] LUST keeps us young. Dancing girls or Godly angels? Her moves shattered me. Such a gorgeous girl in this place? When can I taste her nectar? Tasting is no more easier. Temple rules are hardened. Also, her group’s forewoman won’t admit it. Forewoman? Thrice earlier, the forewoman herself entertained us overnight. That was the past. Rules are stringent nowadays. Least possible. Then, send them to my place. I will buy the group completely. Relocate them to Cholan temples. The King’s order will be demanded. [MOCKINGLY] King? We ARE the Gods here. I will look after the orders. Prepare them to move. Why are you keeping dull? Nothing... Today, some new males witnessed us Feel of distress after seeing them. Day to day, many watch us... Nothing matters. Okay, tell me. What should I do to make my girl happy? Bring me Kannan (the God of Love). Or liberate me from here. Oh... you said Kannan would come on his own. But now, you are demanding of me? Should we go in search of him? We? How is that possible? This progress should happen. Victory or defeat, it doesn't matter. It is the seed of hope. Somedays, this seed will enthrone our clan. Your act will be a suicide. Your vision will eradicate our group. Pandiyas are not baiting fishes. They are whales who swallow sharks. If Pandiyas decide, Einars will be no more. Pandiyas won't even think about us. That is our strength. They have no clues about us. A planned strike at the right time will shudder them. Whatever you plan, the probability is ZERO. Our victory is a mirage. WE ARE FIGHTING. Those who fear blood can stay back. History will roar that hundreds of Einars have overthrown thousands of Pandiyas. Kalan will be the lead till I come back. If not, he will be the leader. Pandiyan ministry wishes you to relocate to the Cholan temple. Your wages will be thrice. Opinion? I don’t know what to say. You people are born dancers. Don’t get trapped here itself. Your visibility in the Cholan temple will be much larger. Your popularity will peak up and will gain stardom. Being here, we are at peace and feel safe. It is the almighty in everything irrespective of the environment. You don’t worry about all that. Stars say, for the next 100 years, Pandiyan kingdom will flourish. You just proceed. I can understand your concern. All animals behave the same before an ambush. Only a daring attack, distinguishes a tiger from a fox. You were scared, lurked and led a nomadic life. Taught the same to me. Why didn’t we cultivate? Where is our land? My child shouldn't ask me these questions. He shouldn’t be a hunting nomad. Without you, I can’t go. Our troops need your presence. You are their hope. Trust me. You come with me, not for my sake, but for my child. Are we animals? To be driven by others? Government's order what we can do. Let the government itself dance. Our Guru’s opinion? “Enhances popularity”, he says. Not for our popularity, but for their lust. Hey, what are you saying? Leave her... Why did you accept, without consulting us? Oh. That mature are you? We ARE RELOCATING to Cholan territory. Get ready to move. The princess of the Pandiyan country Surani, might have encountered some evilness last Monday and fell sick... for her recovery, people should give their offerings. Parents of girl children can offer them to the temple and get 100 gold coins as a token of gratitude. "Einars will offer back the castle to the Cholas." ''Once the castle is captured, I need 20 thousand Cholan troops to withstand.'' ''The castle will fall in a year.'' 100-year-old, the forefather of our clan, step outside and see the offerings for you. News? Einars have decided to fight. You should bring down Kotravai (Goddess of drylands). Who is the chief here? For Einar’s victory, you should do sacrificial rites to Kotravai. Not Humble enough. For Einar’s victory, the priest should give sacrifices to gain the compassion of Kotravai. Get the field ready after two days. Seyon, Seyen, Agaththa, Agudhai, and Veerase as ancestors Kothi, born in this clan, had decided to sever Pandiyan's heads for the cause of Einar's rise. Einars who want to be on his side PLEDGE to protect your leader even with your own lives. At dusk the Ka(God), with great rage... tearing the sky apart brought down a thousand lightening. Those lightening burnt everything in the land. Ashes formed due to the years of burning... ..formed black clouds and masked the entire sun. For ages, the DARKNESS persisted. Flowing winds, streaming rivers, and mighty oceans were all frozen. when all other lives perished, withstanding everything the southern people survived. The aggrieved God... "If you are still surviving... ..the water and land you worship, will swallow you up" SHE cursed. At last, a fine dawn made the sun's rays reach the earth. As if it got released from a captive, his rays melted everything back from frozen. The stagnant sea turned violent... and swallowed up Southern people's land and life. To protect their people the southern ancestors, sacrificed their own life... ..and earned the compassion of God. The convinced God, controlled the violent ocean. "The southern race will ascend higher... ..divide to numerous clans, spread across and rule the world” “Without remembering themselves, they will destroy each other." That's their fate", God said and left. Since then, the southern race got split into numerous clans. Innumerous battles broke in... though countless lives were lost, the lively clan's southern souls will be on our side always. Also, in the forthcoming war, to save our clan, worshipping them, we will offer the first sacrifice to the South. Bring the offering into the field. Mugami, Moorkki, Anangi, Imathi, Imuki, Kaali, Muththirumeni, Thenmuga nambini, Ikaari, Arami, Uruvili, Accept our sacrifice... Descend to the field. From all the eight directions save our Einars. Give your powers to the Einar troop. Whomsoever are against Einars... ..sever their heads. I command you. Accept our sacrifice. Maththiri, Umaimugi, Vaanarasi, VelYevi... Bring the next offering into the field... Seyen, the son of Kotravai... Einars need your spear and army which can save the whole world. Your sight even kills the mighty death itself "The mighty Muruga". Now, come down and accept our sacrifice. save Einars. I am pitching you. Bring the next offering into the field. Save Einars in this war. Accept our sacrifice and cherish it. cherish it. Infuse into the offering... Protect Kothi. Cleanse the God. Feast him. Einar’s Leader should surrender your weapon to Kotravai, Kneel and beg. Step back. Kotravai, leave out the offering... Take him along with you... He is a warrior, his ancestry is heroic, and his bloodline is courageous. Bring peace to his soul. Let Einars win... Accept our sacrifice and cherish it. Protect Kothi. Accept our sacrifice and cherish it. Cherish it. Protect Kothi. Within two nights we should mingle with the Cholan people. Following you, successive groups will intrude. Within 10 days, 1000 fighters would be in. We shouldn't get spotted as bunches. Groups of ten should infringe with time and location diversified. Further details will be conveyed to you by your commanders. This war may seem to be impossible, But we can certainly win even without sacrificing a single ours life. This war is for our future generations. Our generations would NO MORE be hunters and nomads. Long live King Kothiyaar! Tell me, who has fear of blood? Tell me... Have you ever seen Ranadheeran? No one had heard the Cheran forces got frightened. That day during the Chera Chola war, the frightened Cheran soldiers fled to the west in large numbers. All uttered the same name... Randheeran got dressed up in ashes and danced like Yama. Remember... You will just get ONE chance to kill Ranadheeran. Missing it, it’s your END. Won't Ranadheeran's physique also tear? Certainly. But who has the sword to tear it? "Cholan territory." This country prolonged its longing to celebrate your dance. ♪ Hail with pleasure Thy feet that rules the Sky ♪ Know Thine meaning at all moments ♪ Surrender You ♪ And rained in season ♪ Melt in dance without any reason ♪ Beaming moon as my face Dancing for you with grace ♪ Reaching you By the feathers of my eyes ♪ Mind rejoices By the flow of your dreams ♪ My heart feels for you ♪ Won't my heart bloom and My mind gloom? ♪ Clouds swim in my hair? ♪ Peacocks with its feathers Won't it come to me and dance in vain? ♪ Born as the Divine of Arts? ♪ Sparks of her Light drive away the darks ♪ The sky too paves the way For her feet to print on Land and sway ♪ Beaming moon as my face Dancing for you with grace ♪ Reaching you By the feathers of my eyes ♪ Mind rejoices By the flow of your dreams ♪ My heart feels for you ♪ Won't my heart bloom and My mind gloom?

Cheran brahmin, descendant of Parasuramar. Great. You cherish the dance. I will be back. There... Despite numerous tries, Ranadheeran cannot be spotted. There is a fear even uttering his name. He is not human, but Yama, they say. Did our fellows mingle with the people? Weapons should be stashed perfectly. They are coming. No need to worry about weapons, already intimations are sent. We will wait. There is an upcoming war, it seems Nothing serious. Amidst our dance, a spy intruded, it seems. At a glance, his looks were northern. With the backing of the Pallavas, Cheras are planning to invade back. Don't lament... Whosoever fights, will our dancing halt? War will happen, amidst that Kannan will arrive and capture you. A beautiful world will be created for you out of the sunken Kumari land. and you will be made as a queen over there. - Stop your boundless fantasies. - Hey… I am leaving. Dive into the waters. No... All regions surrendered under the Pandiyas. No more revolutions. As the majority of the army had gone to Arikesari’s ceremony, only few are left inside the castle. Though Ranadheeran’s guarding is becoming liberal, he is always guarded by 100 warriors. Especially by Greeks and Senvarman who stand as his shadow. In daylight, a crow can win a powerful owl. We will wait for the right spot Where Ranatheeran’s power will certainly diminish. Every Friday, Ranadheeran won't miss the mountain temple. Most of the troops stay at the foothills. Higher, the path is narrowed. The only way to move is one behind the other. For about a mile, the path is surrounded by forests. Approximately 50 climb the mountain. We can split and surround them on both sides. I will stop the rest of the soldiers at the foothills. Ranadheeran should be separated from greeks and the Commander. His head is the target. Not a single Pandiyan should climb down alive. With the severed heads, we will enter the castle bearing the Cholan flag. Seeing their leader’s head Pandiyan soldiers will tremble. Witnessing the Cholan flag the Cholan people will be on our side. The castle will fall. We will HUNT the HUNTERS. Remember... We will just get ONE fine chance. Reinforce the shield barrier. Who are they? Who are they? It doesn't matter who they are. Reinforce the shield barrier. We are PANDIYANS Don't get terrified. We captured the great Cholan castle. We made the Pallavas turn back. We made the Cheras to surrender. we destroyed the whole Kalapirar reign. What can a small group do? Reinforce the shield barrier. MASSACRE THEM ALL. It's over. May not be that simple. They would have guessed our strategy by now. This time, the shield barrier should open up precisely. Get ready. Support Senvarman. Backup the KING. Go... You go... go... I will manage. I will manage. RANADHEERA... -Who's approaching? -Don't know... -How long to reach the castle? -Less than 20 mins. The king hasn't returned from the temple yet. Nothing seems to be right. Higher rank women shouldn't come out. People should restrain in their homes. Can the elephantry be assembled? No. Then chase the elephants into the forests. In case we fail, elephantry must not go under the rival's control. Go. Assemble ALL the forces to make a barrier around the castle. - No single attacker should survive. - This strategy won't work out. The attackers are large in numbers. Clustering will be a setback for us. Here.. take the lead Give your strategy. Tell... Tell your strategy... The approach is looking boorish... You are renowned warriors. Can't you slaughter them? What happened to your practices? The King and the commanders are missing from the castle. They have a defined plan. They think they can defeat us with their count. With confidence, assault the front liners. The followers will run back. Proceed. Pandiyam… Pandiyam… Pandiyas are falling. Soon, the castle will surrender to the enemies... Come... Come... Faster... Come... Send messages to Cholas and Tribal chiefs. Troops should arrive on time. Message sent. Also, THUDI will bring our troops. For three days, people should confine to their homes. Kill those who do not comply. Kill the surrendered Pandiyan warriors. Take possession of the serving women... DO NOT touch the Cholan and Pandiyan higher rank women. What's the crowd? Temples are sealed. The Brahmin and the dancers needed to meet you. - What? - Humble salutes. Wars happen. Kings may change. But, God is common. Why temples should be closed? The dancing girls can’t stay anywhere else. Who are you? In the absence of the king and ministers, I have the authority to lead this city. Authority? Where do you belong to? Pandiyan country. You can go back. Temple won’t be reopened. Disperse. Travel? In this darkness? YOU... escort them. The one with AUTHORITY. Kill those, who stay past a couple of minutes. Stop. You stay with me. They are Devaradiyars, who have married Gods. They can’t live with others. From now on, I am the God here. You stay. It is already past 1 minute, the authority bearer. Parasuramar's descendant! Climate changes and so as the wind directions. Thudi, we have messaged the Cholan. Though, it may take time for him to arrive. We need strength. I believe only in you. You go. Thudi, bring the rest of our men who earlier denied to invade. Tell them that we had defeated Pandiyan. Say something... Somehow, bring some forces. Only these bodies are recoverable. Who? Spied as "Einar clan" The count of Einars? Maximum of a thousand. How many of ours are alive? With the Cholan flag, they entered the castle. People thought them as Cholan troops and joined them. Not many of ours survived. Very few survived. But they too can't fight. A dynamic army with more than 3 lakh troops, The king of kings who terminated the 300-year-old Kalapirar’s reign... The troops who chased Cheras and Thondai country's army... A son of a small clan, if he and his troops decided to stand against ME... HE is a brave warrior... It is my duty, to give him an honorable place in heaven. Watch out for the boundaries keenly. Before the internal riots break out, we have to finish this. We will assemble our own army. Within a month, Einars will fall. This is MY WAR. MY TURN. "Perumpalli's region" Greets. Greets. Heard that Einars captured the Cholan castle. Why do barbarians even want to taste KINGDOM? The identity of Yaathisai, the KING of kings who rules between the Venkadam hills and Kanyakumari... In welcoming Ranadheera Pandiyan our Perumpalli Velir clan is honored and pleasured. This way... It was a cunning strike. No idea to sort help from the shark to attack the mere fox. So, I haven't requested the capital. Perumpalli's help is certainly needed. Not as a help. but as a duty, we Perumpalli will certainly do. From Nediyon's era, till the defeat of the Cheras, Perumpallis are with the Pandiyas. Majority of our Perumpalli warriors earned heaven in the Cheran war. Now everyone capable will come. What will be the deed of exchange? What's the expectation? Pandiyan bloodline should marry our girl. What is this treaty? We are not equal to you for making a treaty. just an obligation. With our girl, 30 elephants, 700 horses, and 5000 Perumpalli troops will be donated by me. The 9 minor troops, under Perumpalli’s regime will also accompany us with their forces. Keep your word. Remember, this bloodline won’t assume the Pandiyan throne. The future will be decided by God. - Any reply from Cholan? - No. Let us wait for another couple of days. Ranadheeran talked with the Perumpalligal. We should advance him. Thudi should have reached our region. Mentality of the Cholan people? Ranadheeran talked with the Perumpalligal. We should advance him. This is a marriage agreement. witnessed by the King of kings, who rule the South, the possessor of the scepter of morality, the Pandiyan emperor's commander-in-chief Sethuvarman, and Perumpalli's commander-in-chief Karmegan, the southern prince, the ray of hope, Ranadheeran, In our Palli's presence, is marrying our girl Araththal. Am I an added burden in exchange for a favor? Not a burden. it's MEN's politics. Feelings don't deserve any space here. In the space where authority and power dominate, small lives like you won't deserve respect. Don't you love me? I have AUTHORITY over you. War wounds want NO LOVE. They need POWER. My rule on you, will save your clan. When your clan is saved, your leader will retain her AUTHORITY. AUTHORITY is the only base for everything here. Your music and mind are spreading sorrows. My music is claiming your DEATH. Let WOMEN and MUSIC be a turn-on for MEN, not DEATH. Your DEATH will be a huge turn-on for me. For men’s lust why common lives like me be sacrificed? To date, how many lives you would have killed? What to do? Our LUST won't settle down. It needs AUTHORITY, MONEY, LADIES... Every creature in this soil should surrender to us. When huge dreams are sowed in the soil, some common lives will naturally perish. Me, Pandiyan, Cheran or Cholan... whoever... our physical appearance may change... but our LUST is the same. When men kill justice, God will come and reform. Remember... When my music STOPS, you are nearing your DEATH. I am waiting. My lust is more powerful than your music. Whatsoever, Let your smell fill my bed tonight too. No reply from the Cholan yet. By now, Perumpallis would increase their troops. We should pace up. Did Cholan betrayed us? Or, is he not ready for the war? Cholan won't betray. I think the news hasn't reached him. Ok, this time I will take the news myself. Perumpallis always do astonish us. Our troops who were heading towards the capital, will also reach here. "Remember..when my music stops, you are nearing your death.” Ranadheeran the warrior... coming with thousands to stand against a few hundreds. Let the march STOP. Don't panic. Pandiyan cannot reach us, till we are inside the castle. The messenger would have reached the Cholan. He would have started now. No traces of Cholas. Regardless of others, Thudi will bring our troops. Don't fear. Cherish Einars... Throw women to entertain them. I will find a way. Don’t give up. Reason behind this waiting? Shall we attack the castle? Patience wins wars. A musth elephant will collapse on its own. Our patience will tremble them. Breaking this castle is not new for us. Already we have sacrificed enough men. Moreover, our entry should not trouble the Cholan people and the seraglio women. Watch out for the boundaries carefully. No news from the Einars should reach the Cheras and Cholas. Let Perumpallis plan to smash the upcoming Einar troops. Ghost. Our enemy is outside. Be focused. Once Cholan arrived, we can go back. No one is coming here. Cholas are no more, after the Chera war. No Cholans are alive. Kothi said as per his imagination. Even with Thudi bringing our army, we cannot be saved from the Pandiyas. Kothi is not our leader... For his lust and illusion, he betrayed us. See him... he is not mingling with us. He had gone mad. Dispose him. Thudi... Thudi... Thudi... Thudi... Will bring my troops. We will DESTROY them with their own WARFARE. What is the mentality of our troops? Food and medicine supply should be flawless. No need to worry. Perfect orders were passed for everything. Nonsense... the sword may hurt you... step apart. Ey... What's your name? Kodungan. Kodungan. Ranadheeran's reward, for your braveness. News? In Cholans' absence Other chieftains are also stepping back. As our forces were destroyed, other supporting clans also withdrew. The castle is surrounded. This is the right time. Throw your orders, to attack the castle. How many Einar troops are... inside the castle? Not precisely known. Nearly thousand. A straight war is not possible. Our counts inside the castle may be misjudged by them. If rightly judged, we are done. Should act fast. Their plan is not known. We will wait for one more day. We will speak with the Cholan citizens. Bring their representative. Message them to surrender. Seeing their response, we will proceed further. All Cholan people are not warriors. How can I ask them to fight? Not to fight. Just for the formation behind us. Ranadheeran won't know that. He will assume all are Einan forces. Our huge crowd will scare them. The news was sent to the Cholan troops. Within two to three days, troops will arrive. Situations will turn favor towards us. Not towards US, towards YOU. Okay. No traces of the arrival of the Cholan troops. How can I convince my people? Do you have any evidence? I can't sacrifice my people. Right? What? the King... Go. Climate changes and so as the wind directions. Parasuramar's descendant! Thanks. One day, time for Einars to surrender. Pandiyans want to repair the situation without any further damage. Senvarman - The Pandian Commander-in-chief "Your vision will eradicate our clan" "This hope, will enthrone our clan one day." "My son will be a born king." Send back the reply. News? Let Ranadheeran be glorified. Einars are not cowards to surrender. Even I don't want casualties on both sides. I put forward a conventional solution to the Pandiyas. With the witness of certain people, I challenge Ranadheeran, or any other warrior from your dynasty to DARE a "single combat" with me. The ONE who wins, will retain the castle. Have guts? Prepare a field on the Uraiyur mountain. Kothi, the leader of Einars. It's Ranadheerans' word. Kothi's last rites will happen grandly. You don’t come with me. Our clan needs you. If I die, Without any delay, lurk into the woods towards the Cholas. Kothi, you are GREAT. Alongside you, I am feeling great too. A Moment or a Century As per your wish, you are living as THE KING. Let the benefit of the Ranatheeran's Navagandam come to you. "A small squad can’t defeat Pandiyas." "Your vision will eradicate our clan." "This hope, will enthrone our clan one day." "My son will be a born king." "Won't Ranadheeran's physique also, tear?" "Certainly." "But who has the sword to do that?" "This is MY WAR." "MY TURN." "Remember." "You will just get ONE chance to kill Ranadheeran." "Missing it," "It’s your END." With the witness of the sky and the underworld, Beyond humans, with the witness of the Demons and the Angels, Besides all, with the witness of God, The Pandiyan prince Ranadheeran, and the Einar’s leader Kothi, representing their own groups, are doing SINGLE COMBAT in this death field. This is the justice for Morality. War of Morality. The pulse of Morality. The expression of Morality. Following our ancestors Kudakko Neduncheralathan and Peruvirarkilli's footsteps, these warriors will also earn their rights. Take your oath... With the witness of the sky and the underworld, [CHORUS] With the witness of the sky and the underworld, Beyond humans, with the witness of the Demons and the Angels, [CHORUS] Beyond humans, with the witness of the Demons and the Angels, Besides all, with the witness of God, [CHORUS] Besides all, with the witness of God, This is a "Single Combat". In between the battle, no one should help the fighters. [CHORUS] We won't... This single combat, will continue till one’s death... or till anyone surrenders. The one who dies certainly will earn heaven. His last rites should be glorified. [CHORUS] Yes... The lost group should surrender to the winner. [CHORUS] Yes... Let the combat start... In case I am dead, the castle will be Einar’s. Without any revolts, return back to the capital. Surrender... Surrender... I... Within you, I LIVE. You... are not me... You can NEVER be me. Everything ended. Nothing has ended. Nothing will end. Yes... Nothing is going to end. Kothi, made a wonder in that field. He fell, by changing himself as the sword to tear Ranadheeran's physique. Burn Kothi’s body. There should not be any traces even. Who can turn down the heat from the burning Kothi's body? Kothi’s deeds should not be converted as seeds. Who can stop the ashes from the heat to spread as seeds and grow in all directions? There shouldn’t be any traces of the Einar clan's existence. Without any compassion, MASSACRE all the moving lives of the clan. Even before anyone had thought to stand against Ranadheeran, he should meet his death. "For men’s lust why common lives like me be sacrificed?" "Okay, tell me. What should I do to make my girl happy?" "Bring me Kannan. Or liberate me from here." "Oh. Earlier you said Kannan would come on his own." "But now, you are demanding of me?" Should we go in search of him? "We? How is that possible?" Till last, you didn't say whether Ranadheeran feared? Not only Ranadheeran, all Kings fear of "Authority" Only "AUTHORITY" is stable here. Not the kings and kingdoms. Only to retain their AUTHORITY, Kings conducted all the wars. To proceed with them, they needed many mere names... Land, People, Virtue, Rights... But... Come, let's go. Ok... Ok... Why that Devaradiyar died? What happened to other Devaradiyars? Is it a one-day story to complete? In reality... The story had just now started... How that devaradiyar's death is going to quake this South? What happened to the other dancing girls? How we caught you? What's the relationship between Greek and Pandiyas, who saved Ranadheeran with his own life. Beyond everything, Only henceforth, the war between the Emperors are going to start... Kothi's death is just a BEGINNING... "Enslaved Cheras towards the Pandiyan territory" "Cholan bunkers" Equip the forces... "YAATHISAI"
