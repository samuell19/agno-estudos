Listen to me, Hector. You must make sure that Anja gets the floppy disk. And if she will get the code and takes the 8 billions? We've no choice. She is the only one who gets in the high-security wing. But she doesn't know about the accounts. Don't worry about Anja. Stop discussing. We're leaving everything as it was. No time to lose. There are others interested in the floppy. Hector. Take care of Anja. She won't make any trouble. Believe me. If they would have known what trouble I would make. Okay. Today they wouldn't trust in me any longer. Ask Hector. Although they had a good plan. There was Claudio Damiato. Just an accountant. But a master in his field of work. Unnoticed he transferred a lot of money to Swiss bank accounts. Thanks for good manners of that accountant. He saved all codes and accounts on a floppy disk. But he died before he could take the money. I'm sorry to say. But he did a mistake. He told someone else about his secret. It was my job to get the floppy for them. Damiato trusted in me. At that time I didn't know much about the floppy. You can never get enough. You sex maniac. No. Never. Come on, Hector. Let me go. You said I have to hurry. Okay. Go. You are right. Your job isn't dangerous at all. Follow my instructions and you won't have any problems. Okay. Trust in me. I will not make any mistakes. Okay? See you in a week. Take care of yourself. - Bye. 8 billions? Oh my god. It's a lot too thin! Do they search for the floppy? Oh! No! Hello? It's me, Anja. Hector. I have seen a murder. At our company. These guys have seen me. What can I do now? Calm down. I call the police. And you go on. Okay? Understand me? Don't you get it? I'm in great danger. Do what I say. - Okay, Hector. What's up? Any trouble with her? Anja? What do you mean? She is nervous. Always the same. Think about what you're talking. Well. I started to doubt about Hector. How could he play down this thing? In the end it was murder. But I racked my brain about another thing: The floppy-disc. What did it mean? 8 billions? Furthermore I suddenly had a constant companion. But it took some time until I knew who it was. Open your eyes, you idiot! Stop the car! Keep to the right! Come on! To the right! Good grief! Can't you hear me? Stop the car! Finally it works. Don't you know? When you're driving it's not allowed to hear walkman. You endanger the traffic. Licence, please. I was not sure if you are really a policeman. Yes, of course. All right. If I will catch you a second time, you can buy a bus-ticket. Do you understand me? Of course. But don't worry about it. Good. Maybe we will meet again. - Drive on. You've got my address. See you. Drive carefully. Indicator light on. Bye. Excuse me. Where is the toilette? The next door on the right side. - Thank you. You know what to do. But it has to look like an accident. 1 will take my eyes on her. Hello honey. What about us? Come on. Take your hands off! 1 don't want to hurt you. Just want to have some fun. - No! I knew that you would like it. I take a souvenir. No! Help me! Be nice to me. - No! What's up here? Take your hands off her. Immediately! No panic. Grandmother. Get out of here or I call the police. You didn't have sex for a long time, right? Do you still know how a dick looks like? Bloody bastard! Piss off! In our days you aren't safe anymore. It isn't the first time. Please take your clothes. I take your handbag. It's all over now. Would you like to drink a cognac? Yes. But don't trouble yourself. No problem. Come on, Hector. Let me go. Do you feel better? Drink something. Thank you. You are so nice to me. Don't worry about. - Thank you. It was murder. These guys have seen me. What can I do now? Come on. I take a souvenir. Come on. You were the first and the last. You bloody bastard. Don't underestimate me, you asshole. Good morning. - Good morning. 1 kilo of clams, please. - 1000 Lire. Thanks. Get off here. These kids always get more and more perky. Are you frightened? Little children shouldn't play with guns. It's just a toy. Oh my god. Hello? Anybody here? Yes. Here. - Where? - Down here. Under the car. I see. I had an accident. Door and trunk are damaged. Would you take a look, please? Where is the car? Outside. In front of your garage. Would you be so kind to help me? What a look. My briefs are flesh-coloured. Looks really nice. Oh, thank you. I don't like underwear too. What's your problem? There was a crazy person who pushed me aside and damaged my car. It was a red jeep. All day long. 1 will take a look at your car. It's no problem. It will take 2 or 3 hours. If you like you can wait here. Watch out. The jeep. Go inside. 1 will give him the low-down. Oh shit! Mummy... Mummy... Do you have a driving licence at all? I don't want to see you again! 1 gave him a low-down. He will not come back. Blowhard. Please wake up. I have finished your car. I didn't hear you coming. My god, you look like... Wait and take a look under my clothes. Come on. I will show you. You are so pretty. Come on. - No. Nobody does it like I do. - No. No, get your hands off. Come on. What's the problem? I don't want it. You drive me crazy. Let's go inside. What do you think? I said NO! I solicite. - Yes, that's right. Please. You would make me happy. Yes. Yes. Another time. |1 don't have any time today. Bye. What about next Saturday? What about paying the bill? Excuse me. Can you show me the way to the next hotel? Yes. Not far away from here. Near by the beach. Follow this road and you will find it. But before I would like to go swimming. Is the water clean? - Yes, of course. I know the beach. Let me show you. If you like. What about your bicycle? Put it in the car. Come on. Nice to have you by my side. I wouldn't have found it by myself. Watch out. There it is. Come along. Come on. Follow me. Let's go swimming. - Yes. That's cold. But not too cold. Coward. Haven't you seen it before? No. Never. What are you waiting for? Wait. I will catch you. - Come on. What's your name? Angelo. Angelo. Come on. Kiss me. Anja. - Yes? - Come here. Hurry. What's up? Anja. Come quick. Is this the car? Why does he always follow me? Yes, it is the asshole. Anja. He drives on. Angelo. I am really afraid. Please, stay by me. If he knows you are here he will not bother me. Stay by me. Okay? - Yes. Angelo? Are you still awake? You will not fall asleep? No. I won't. You will not close your eyes until tomorrow morning. I like sleepless nights. What about you? Me too. You look like an angel. Sorry. I had to go to work. I would like to see you again. Ask for Angelo. Everyone in town knows me. Do you know how it happened? A drunken driver I think. Somebody must have seen the accident. The driver is away long ago. No. It is not true. I know this bike. Isn't it Angelo's bike? Yes. - How did it happen? We don't know. They took him away. To the Hospital. Which hospital? 1 think to the Lucia - Hospital. Thank you. - Best wishes to him. Come on. Let's go. It seems that she is really afraid. Poor Angelo. Do you remember these two guys? Yes, I do. Yesterday evening we played poker. They owe me 10.000 Lire. I need the money. Something to drink? A double brandy, please. Just a moment. How much? 2000 Lire. Do you know a way to Lucia-Hospital without using the highway? Yes. You drive left and follow the dirt track. 1 will find it. Come on. I show you the way. Take the road on the left side. Then you drive straight forward. Can I pay the bill? Asshole! Hello. Can I rent a car? Just for some days. Just one left. - Great. Can you wash my car in the meantime? - Of course. - Thank you. I take you baggage. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought the room would be free. - No problem. What time is it? 7:30 am. Can I do something for you? No, thanks. You can go. Everything you wish for. Bye. This evening I had the pleasure to meet Svetlana. No... To meet each other isn't the right word. Well. Svetlana had two faces. First I got to know her nice side. Later on... We will see... One martini with olive, please. - One moment. Didn't I see you before? I don't think so. Maybe you are right. Would you give me an olive? Of course. Thank you. I don't know your schedule. But why don't we go for a meal together? Why not? Thanks for your invitation. My name is Svetlana. I'm Russian. In secret mission. My name is Bond. James Bond. Oh, what pretty girls you are. Get along with you! I would prefer the blond. Good evening, ladies. The black one was also hot. Please. Take place. Thank you. - Wine, please. Believe me. Vain guys are everywhere. But you get used to them. I would like to dance. What about you? You're in the mood? Yes. Of course. Tell me... - Yes? - Rock or romantic music? It doesn't matter. Just dancing. Dancing with you. Let's go. I can hardly await. Me too. We will dance all night long. - Yes. Promised? - Yes, I promise. We will not go to bed before sunrise. - Okay. We will do so. Nothing's going on here. - Maybe later. Let's drink. They play good music here. Look, there are some nice girls. Hello, what about a triple? Where do you go sweethearts? They never have new ideas. Take them at their word and they will disappoint you! Come on. Let's dance. - Yes. DJ. What does that mean? Why do you play that kind of music? We want to hear rock music. Look at them. I already ordered breakfast. You were still sleeping. I didn't want to wake you up. - Thank you. Do you want some coffee? - Yes. It is still warm. Here. - Thanks. I need you, Svetlana. Don't leave me alone. I am really full of fear. But I have to go. You will make it by yourself. I'm sure. You should better lock up your door. Everyone could come in. What are you doing? You like it shaved? Stop that. Get out of my room. Don't be so prudish. You want it too. Don't you? - No. Take your hands off. Come on. I will do it better than this ugly blond girl. Get out of here. Leave me alone. You don't like me? You like more the old ones. What a pity! Bye. Oh, look here. That's the truth. You bitch! You will be surprised. What can I do for you? My car key, please. Your car is in front of the hotel. - Thank you. They want to kill you. It should look like an accident. Hope you will make it. You will no longer make me anxious. I am sorry Hector. But only one of us could survive. And it wasn't you. And you too, lovely Svetlana. You will get your just deserts. It will take some time until she will notice that it is the wrong floppy. Don't you think so, Hector? You did a good job, Hector. Angelo! Hello, Angelo! It's me. Anja. Anja! Anja! Angelo! There you are at last! Did you miss me? No, not at all. Do you know that I am a rich woman? Of course you are. How much millions? No millions. We are talking about EIGHT BILLIONS! Yes, of course. Come on. Come on! Tonio! Can we rent your boat? If need be... Don't worry. This time I will pay for it. That means my girlfriend does. You must know she is a rich woman. Come on. I love you. Angelo. Pay attention. When I tell you this story I enjoy the life with Angelo. I enjoy the life to the full. Thanks to the eight billions. Eight billions are enough. I never heard again of Svetlana.
