In Bambara culture, mentors teach the young to be worthy members of their communities. In Ntomo society, social training consists of five stages: In The Lion Stage you learn where you come from. The Toad Stage teaches you where you're going. The Bird Stage teaches you what you are. The Guinea Fowl Stage places man within the cosmos. The final stage shows you your place in society. This final stage is called the Dog Stage (Wulu) Bamako, June 2007 Give me the 500 Francs! And all her money! Apprentice, knock! I'm coming! Give me your plate. We're coming. Get in!

Those carrying nothing, no bags, no baskets or kids, are also good. Avoid women with big bottoms. They can make cost you 10% in lost fares. Avoid taking the handicapped and the elderly.

Lots of minibuses shuttle between Mali and Guinea. We'll be less noticeable than with the company vans. Customs agents don't like to stop minibuses. If we do this right, we'll move a lot more of it, fairly safely. Here. Or here. How much does he want? He said 10 million, but I think he'll take 8. What will the body work on the van cost?

Everybody out. So... you're the little rascal nobody can beat. You bring so much, I have a lot more stock. I'll have to start delivering up north. Thank you. I'm giving you a 4X4. The army checkpoints will know you're transiting. But the desert may pose problems. If you accept, you and your friends will be armed. Issiaka will give you everything you need. Where? Timbuktu.

I'm looking for a purse. Sorry. We don't sell purses. This is an art boutique. A luxury purse is art. Let me. - Hello. - Hello. What you say is partly true, but, unlike luxury, art is about more than money. May I show you around? Why not? Every day, for seven days. Doufntza - 26 km Timbuktu - 197 km Stay there. Let go of me!

Face treatments. Manicure, pedicure... She even does what the Europeans do... - The bikini line? - Yeah, that. What did you say? Of course, dear. I'll give you her number. One day, a lion entered a plot without anyone seeing him. The place belonged to Demba, the hunter. The lion found himself before a boy who was watering the garden. When he saw the lion, the boy picked up a stone and told the lion: "Hey, what are you doing at my father's house? "Get out! "Get out before I go get him so he can kick your ass! "You bum!" Above the lion, coiled around a tree branch, was a serpent. The serpent said: "Great Lion! "King of the Savanna, "a boy speaks to you like that, "and you do nothing?" The lion turned his head towards the serpent and said: "Well, serpent, "as you can see, "he's only a child. "He doesn't know me." Seeing that the lion was not going away as he had asked, the child got impatient and said: "Very well! "You asked for it!" And he went into the house. They heard him scream: "Dad! "Dad! "Dad! "There's a cat on our property. "I can't chase him off." The father ran outside. Seeing the lion, he froze and then fainted. The lion turned to the serpent: "You see? "He knows me." We behaved like blissfully naive children. Slowly. Don't fill it too much. We're better off here than with those shitty clients. Don't you think? As of this moment, you may not eat or drink anything. Got that? Quickly now. Swallow them right away. I'll come pick you up in an hour. Yes. The boss wants to see you. I'm on my way. Wait here. - Anne-Marie, how are you? - Good. Hey, little fishies! Nice, Issiaka. How are you, kids? Issiaka! You're a kilo short. Come here. Only one person could have done it. - I'll reimburse it. - No. You know that's not the point. So deal with it, or Issiaka will. Understood. Good. - So glad you could come. - Hello. Remember my brother Ladji? How could I forget? - See you in a bit, then. - With pleasure. Can you imagine having a house like this? It smells good even outside. Do you know my daughter? She was in the States. She just came back, and opened a beautiful boutique. No, thanks. Hello. You're Ladji, right? My name is Alioun. Your sister told me you want to buy some land. With the inflation here in Bamako, that's the best thing you can do right now. Your new friends are great! Are you OK? Is everything alright? - I'm OK. - Oh... I need to eat something. - Excuse me. - Please... - I saw her eyeing you. - Who? Who? Assitan! She couldn't stop looking at you. They have money to burn. That buffet must have cost a fortune. I'd try to date her if I were you. She's cute, too. Imagine that. If you marry a girl like that, you'll never have to work again. It's a great opportunity. You could build a nice house here. You can even build a pool. Large or small? Oh, large. Why small? We have enough money for it. I trust you, ma'am. Hello. Is this all you've done? Bamako, December 24, 2008 Your party is great. You look good like that. - How are you? - I wasn't making fun of you. Good for you. I'm an important person. What time is it? Almost noon. I better go. The situation in Guinea is turbulent. The army attempted a coup d'état after the death of President Conté, who had ruled for 24 years. There has been no violence, so far, but the international community urges all sides to seek a peaceful democratic transition. Jean-Yves Ferrand. The shaky image reflects the upheaval. A captain announced by radio that the government has been replaced by a National Council for Democracy and Progress. Lansala Conté ruled with an iron fist for 24 years. Last year, he suppressed a general strike killing 200 people. - Young people are protesting, participating in an effort to usher in change. Fifty years of mistakes are history. We will take our destiny into our hands, and, when the time is right, we will act. Did you spend all the money? It's escalating. There are ongoing negotiations with the rebels in Conakry, to keep the coup d'état from becoming a civil war. We have to be discreet. - Everything's on hold. - Let's do one last run. I have 120 employees here. I have a firm to run, I have responsibilities. I won't risk all this just for your sake. We played, we had fun. When the risk is too high, you wait. I need money. How much? As much as you can. 10,000 euros? Is that all you can do? I can do 15,000. I'll give them to Issiaka. Call him tomorrow. Thanks. Ladji. Don't come back here. Please. Hello. Wow! A Yamaha. Hello. That's just my brother. He's a little off. I'll call you, then. You better. Ciao. How are you doing? Having fun? Shut up! We must sell the house. No way! We'll spend less. We have no choice. We have to sell it. We still owe the workers money. We won't sell it. Even if we have to eat rocks. With my contacts, I could get a job at a ministry, in government. This is no time to panic. Had you wooed Assitan, you could have asked her for money. I'm not the one who whores. I know. I'm the whore. But you've become a dog. It took ages but you finally called. I was busy. Excuse me. Are you ready to order? - Just a few more minutes. - Of course. Why are you smiling? The last time I went out with someone was in the US. Almost two years ago. It seems weird. Why did you come back? For foreigners, the focus is always on your national identity. I felt like I didn't know my own country. - You find that ridiculous. - No. But... The statues... Do they connect you with your roots? You're a Senufo, right? Yes. Did you see that calao behind you? It tells me more about you than you ever would. Like what? It told me that strong back is your capacity to withstand tests to protect your people. It told me that big belly is a sign of knowledge. It's the knowledge you hide and refuse to reveal to indiscreet eyes. It tells me that its long, pointed beak is the expression of a man who only talks to commit himself, and who honors his word. It told me that you are a good man, Senufo man. They're interrogating people and broadcasting everything. Everyone's at risk. I didn't want to take the risk. I moved here to live in peace. You could come live in Mali. I know. But I'm not unhappy here. I thought about what you asked me. Here is my proposition. Send the 400,000 dollars to my supplier in Venezuela. He sends us the goods. Let's say he sends 700 kg. I will get 100 kg of that. That will be my payment. The rest is yours. Do the math. You'll pay less than... 700 dollars per kilo. You won't get that in Bogotá. What about the 400,000 dollars? You no longer work with Jean-François... I'll figure it out. OK. But choose your partners well. Don't try to fuck me over. Dad insists that you stay for dinner. - OK, with pleasure. - Yes? That requires a real husband... - What a story. - Absolutely. You know, that reminds me of a joke a French military man told me during a training course. He said, "Don't write the idiots off..." "With a little training, they can make good soldiers." Son... would you like a nice cigar? Won't you have dessert? This house is a real paradise. It's the fruit of a whole lifetime's work. Do you think it could be yours one day? Do you see yourself in my place? Using my silverware? Sleeping in my bed? You fuck my daughter. I know who you are. What you do, who you frequent. So I want you out of here. Is that clear? I need to land a Cessna loaded with 700 kg of coke. Out of those 700 kg, 100 will go to pay my intermediaries. We will share the money from the other 600. I have a contact in Morocco who will take the lot for 15,000 euros per kilo. That's 9 million euros, minus bribes for al-Qaida, for us. But I need to be sure that I can land the plane and then cross the country to reach Algeria. Al-Qaida will transport the merchandise. But the army must also cooperate. And... I need 400,000 dollars. Suppose I had 400,000 dollars to bet in a poker game. How do I know I can trust you? You investigated me. You know you can trust me. I'll think about it. But, as for Assitan... I don't want you to see her anymore. Period. Is that clear? I just paid the school. Yes, I talked to them on the phone. We'll go see you as soon as the boy gets out. OK. - Let me know, then. - Sure. Northern Mali - March 16, 2009 They're here. - All good? - Good, how are you? Here, here, here. Let me see our laissez-passer. Why didn't you sell to the Moroccans? - Don't you trust them? - That's not it. - What was your price? - 15,000 euros/kg. Do you know how much a gram costs in the US? 120 dollars. Don't you lose some to the mules? No, not me. I have a sure-fire method. Unaccompanied minors. You know what this is? Children... travelling alone. Nobody checks them. I put the merchandise around their waists like this. And they breeze right through. Military Checkpoint - Gossi Route. Hello. Car papers. Our passes. Open the trunk. Sergeant, let them through. I have to see what they have. Let them through. That's an order! The trunk! Sergeant! Arrest both of them. What I have here could finance 10 electoral campaigns. Yes, General. Yes. Send the reinforcements. Yes, General. Thank you. How do we split all that? Don't even think about it. It will be a carnage. You'll be the first to die. This is our home, here! Free them! We make the law, here! Free them! - What's going on? - They came to free us. This is our home! This week is busy. Let's postpone it till next week. Excellent! Money goes to royalty! Gold goes to royalty! Shit! Saly, Senegal - April 18, 2009. To you, my friend. It's true. It's true. I feel really good here. How was your trip to Paris? Cocaine traffic sowed discord in the army, spawned rivalries between communities, and financed terrorists groups, contributing to the collapse of Mali in 2012. Subtitles: ECLAIR
