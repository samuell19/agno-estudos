Gomarov Scenery by Sidamon-Eristov and F. Push Military "opportunity" (as traveled around the Caucasus during Lermontov's time.) Treasurer of Fort Evgenievsky (M.Koreli) with his wife, a very passionate lady (Bela Beletskaya) Ensign Pechorin (N. Prozorovsky). Exiled to the fort for a duel. Courier (G. Sarchimelidze) Evgenievsky fortification Approaching the fort, the carriages raced along. - Look, how interesting! ... but at halts and overnight stays, they would again be guarded by a convoy. - We have so few rooms in the fort... - We have lovely rooms for you in the outbuildings. - I don't advise you moving from camp, the Highlanders will just shoot. - And we were so afraid for you. - I'm safe, but our soldier was shot... Morning in a peaceful, Circassian village, conquered by Russia. Bela (Tina Machavariani) Her older sister, Gulnar (Natalia Tatosova) Kazbich (peaceful, or maybe not Circassian) (A. Takayishvili) - Thank Allah that you are Bela’s brother, or there'd be trouble. After all, I just wanted to ride it... - How does a child like you get to sit on such a horse! But Karagez will still be mine. This was told to you by Azamat (I. Merabishvili) Evgenievsky Fort Hey, report to the commandant. Commandant Maxim Maximych (V. Obolensky) - The unexpected has arrived, sir. - Everything alright? - What's alright! The highlanders killed Sidorchuk... The "official" occupations of the garrison... Arrived at your disposal - How pale and thin you are. It’s clear you're from St. Petersburg. - And you're bored... - He's called Azamat, an amusing boy. - Want to get a gold coin? - Steal the best goat from your father's herd, you'll get this coin. - I'll bring it today. - Hey, Azamat, you're in over your head. Yaman (bad) will be your head. - Why are you corrupting the boy? And that night... In the house of Bela's father... The female half of the princely house. - You have goods, I have a merchant... I came to marry your daughter Gulnar to my Mamed. - He's a dashing dzhigit, he's no shame to our clan. - A prince has arrived from a neighbouring village to marry his son to her. - Glad to be related to you. We have always been cousins. - Let's go see the bride. - What is it, Maxim Maximych! What is it? - God be with you. You don’t blink an eye under bullets, but shake from broken glass like a child. Shame on you. - Maxim Maximych, do you believe in fatalism? - Well, in predestination? - In God, I believe, not in your kind of fatalism. - Do you remember, I told you the story of the fatalist Vulich, how he shot himself with a loaded gun and it misfired, and that night a drunken Cossack hacked him to death with a sword. - Well, that’s how it was meant to be. - After all, this is fatalism, you old fool! - Your Honour! A prince has arrived from a peaceful village. - Let him in! - I have engaged my eldest daughter Gulnar. Don't refuse an invitation to the wedding. - Thank you. I'll certainly come. And bring a young friend with me. - I beg you to honour me. - And now you're cooking at home, I know you like to treat yourself... Wedding day. - Traditionally, the bride accepted gifts and congratulations in the saklia, while the guests enjoyed themselves in the courtyard. - Our young dzhigits are slender, but the Russian officer is slimmer, he is like a poplar between them... But he won't bloom in our garden... - Well, what is it? - The beauty! - Kazbich, give me Karagez. I would give 300 mares for him. - Yes, you won’t find such a horse in the whole of Kabarda. - Since it was over the Terek, I crept up to the Cossack post... ... many hours passed... Since then, we have never been parted. - Do you want me to steal my sister for you, Bela? - After all, she is beautiful! Is she not worth your horse? There are many beauties in our auls, Stars shine in the darkness of their eyes. How enviable to sweetly love them. O joyous will of the young. Gold buys four wives, But a dashing horse has no price. He can't stay away from the whirlwind on the steppe. He won't cheat, he won't deceive. - After all, she is beautiful! .. Is she not worth your horse? Kazbich! I will die if you do not give me Karagez... - Go away, you crazy boy. Where will you ride my horse! In three steps he will throw you. - Kazbich wanted to kill me. - And what about Azamat! For Karagez he promised to steal Bela from Kazbich. The image of Pechorin haunts Bela everywhere. - I see, Azamat, that you like Karagez a lot and like the back of your head you can't see him. - What would you give to the one who would give it to you? - Anything he wants! - I swear you will own that horse, only to have it you must give me your sister Bela. - Well, suit yourself. I thought you were a man, but you're just a kid. It's too soon for you to be riding. - Listen, Russki, if you cheat me, you won't live... Father went hunting and taking advantage of this... - Look Russki... I kept my word, and if you... - Tomorrow at three o'clock Kazbich will be with Maxim Maximych. - Bela is missing... And Azamat has disappeared... - Oh, sir, you should let the poor thing go... - Quiet! It's none of your business... - Ensign, you have committed a misdemeanour for which I can be held accountable... Please hand over your sword... - Mitka, my sword! - Listen, Grigory Alexandrovich, admit it's not good that you took Bela away. - It is, if I like her? - But, if her father finds out, then you'll have to give her back. - How will he find out? If we give this half-savage, his daughter, he'll either kill her or sell her. Leave her with me, and keep my sword. - I came to get money for sheep. - Yes, it’s not easy for a dzhigit to lose a horse like that... So he lay there all night, and in the morning... - Who stole my Karagez? - Azamat... - His whole family will answer to me for this... - Listen, dear, kind Bela. You see how much I love you. If you are sad, I'll die. Tell me you'll be more cheerful. Or do you love some Chechen? If so, I'll let you go right away. - Well, then kiss me. - Please, please, don't, don't... - Listen, my peri! After all, you know that sooner or later you must be mine! Why do you torment me so? - I am your slave, your captive. Of course, you can force me... - She's a devil, not a woman! I give my word of honour that she'll be mine. - Want to bet? In a week... - I won’t return until I find the kidnapper. - Goodbye, sweet Bela. I thought you would love me and I was wrong. - Remain full mistress of all that I have, if you wish. Return to your father... farewell! - I'm going. Where to, I do not know! It may not be long before I am pursuing a bullet or a sabre's blow. Then think of me and forgive me. Both were happy. Pechorin dressed up Bela in the most fantastic costumes. - Bela, my dear, dance... - But not six months later... - Have pity on Bela, she's fading by the hour. You can't get a word out of her all day long. - I'm bored with her. I'm more worthy of pity than she is. In me the soul is corrupted by light, the imagination restless, the heart insatiable... Often Maxim Maximych drove Bela to the ramparts, from where her native mountains were visible... - That is Kazbich. And under him is my father’s horse. - Yesterday he left... I don't think he loves me. You can't have him sitting around like he's attached to your apron strings. He likes to chase game, he'll come and go. And if you're sad, he'll soon get bored. - What is this idyll? - There's Kazbich across the river. I bet he recognized Bela... - Bela, from now on you should no longer go to the ramparts. - Don’t go away... I have a premonition... - All that remains of home. - The master ordered you not to. I won’t let you go! - Water! A drink! English subtitles: corvusalbus & agape
