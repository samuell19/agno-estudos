I try not to think about you. And that heart aches sweetly. My head is absolutely empty, and my hands drops. In the evenings I often sit alone and think of you. What are you doing? what are you worried about? How are you there? Alec said I could send you anything and that kept me thinking. BELLA It's all right here. Staffis teaches Costas physics, chemistry and mathematics. He went to a music school to learn to play piano. In October he started learning English. The kid is doing ballet. She's happy and doing well. The grandmothers are fine. They constantly ask why you don't write. After you left, the money in the envelope turned out to be 25 thousand instead of 80. We spent it quickly, but to be honest, I was shocked when I saw how little was left. As you might think, sometimes there are so many bills, but not enough money. I wish I hadn't spend them all! Everyone is asking for money. Calm down people! Be decorous. And on top of that I'm going to come to you for Christmas. Maybe with Kostas. Can you imagine me wearing a fur hat in Athens? Unlikely. It was clear from your tone what was in your heart. All clear. I will say one thing. Remember what this experience will give you. You won't be there for long... around mature political life. The picture doesn’t get out of my head. The moment we left you at the airport. You had several emotions on your face. You looked at me, but at the same time to the future. You're a miracle! I was jealous of the theater. I wanted to be with you in the third row. But I am here, far from you, living in a madhouse! Here's our news in full detail. Thalia married Takis. Dress, wedding, and everything. After the wedding, we went to a house full of people. Gifts, money and so on. Irini was very happy to go. But when the newlyweds got into the car, decorated with ribbons, she wanted to go with them. She was ready to cry and we left. I'm scared! Irini kept repeating everything that she liked about the bustle of the wedding, and that she would go there every day. She said: "Let's visit mom every day and then leave." Remember when Talia wanted to see Irini before you leave? We went there and she said: "she'd better stay with us, we can give her our last name, and we can adopt her". Fair game! Yes, but you will get wet! Center, like this! Color, right! Good! Now aim! To the center! Fine! Let's! go Costas is getting prettier. He was elected head of the class. He also wanted to join the student council, but he was not chosen. He is already a teenager. He was surprised by your lovely letter. He didn't understand why you wrote all this, but the meaning of the letter is clear to him. We talked, and it turns out that he really likes the USA, not only because of BMX bikes, but because of freedom and so on. It is imperative to discuss your letter with him, and I'll do it! Damn, this is not a joke. - Thank you! - You're welcome! How is your study? How do you feel? ANFI (TO FLOWERS) WITH LOVE. CHRISTOS How do Soviet girls look in winter clothes? As you can imagine, I have a lot of worries here. Kostas, have you done your homework? But I try not to lose my nerve. Observe decency... I'm joking with Tina every day I measure my mother's pressure, discuss with Kostas where he can ride his bike, discuss his lessons, his desire to quit the music school. I bathe my dog ​​on Sundays. The rest is on Kostas, but he has to be reminded. I hide from Iliopoulos when I have no money. My colleagues Efi Labropoulou and Katerina Papamikail invited us to a housewarming party, and I tell them all about you. Chaos! And also Kostas... in the role of director. I am looking forward to your opinion on the problems I have written about. Mom, pour me some water. Pour yourself, I'm busy! I can understand if you consciously think about it. I thought I saw you on the street twice but of course it wasn't you. I liked what you wrote about equal opposites, about how you feel about us being one whole. I liked it because I realized that you can think of me and what we have in common. It felt good, now I have something to hold on to I was flattered. Honestly, sometimes I get terribly lonely. Friends cannot fill this void. Maybe this is because I have not yet been allowed to come there. I don't even dare to hope to see you soon. I don't know. I have a bad feeling that they will refuse me. Time seemed to have stopped at the famous Belgrade Hotel. Where we entered inside without a card. Took the elevator to room 1717, keys in hand. That trip shocked me. After it, it was difficult to return to normal life. What can I say? Weird, like never before. I don't even know how to describe it. And you? This is Christos... This is Anfi... You... - To me! - Good! - This is Costasu. - Costas, this is for you! - Dad, am I the last one? - Wait! - We'll reach you soon. - I don't want to be the last! - Okay, just wait. - This is Irini. - Here you go! - Good! Wonderful. - Dad! - What is it? - Here, another one! - Another one! - Well done, Irini! - Awesome! - Keep it up! - Good girl! We all miss you very much. But I miss you the most. I think Costas thinks so too. ...we will remain true to our hearts, our honor. Love us or hate us, you won't please everyone My kisses to you. Happy New 1987 Year! It's already half past nine in the evening. So it’s half past ten there. I wonder what are you doing now. I try to focus and do a million things, not an easy task. Impossible. Costas went to the cinema. Mom is at home, Irini is playing in the living room. And me... instead of work, I think about Moscow, our walks, the hotel, you... And it hurts, almost physically. There is no strength to endure. Life is hard right now. Today I finally received your last letter. God bless! I no longer know what to do with myself, your mother was worried and I, no matter how hard it is to admit, got frustrated for any reason. You know how it happens to me. But we're halfway there, right? I Adore you! Your Anfi. Am I still yours? We did not, of course, celebrate my 40th birthday. Why would you? I just treated the children to baklava after work. I'm always without money, trying to make ends meet. The crisis of capitalism has pushed us to the very edge with its tricks. I took off and bought myself white pants. Over 3500! In the meantime, my colleagues are getting married, sending out invitations. Lately, I have been taking everything to heart. But I understand your concerns and irritation. Every day I am more and more convinced that, unfortunately, the future of humanity is not theirs. But here, too, everything rots, and very quickly. I often think that children will have a hard time in the future. I'm worried about Kostas, he's so vulnerable. Why am I telling you all this? Forget it. What matters is... I miss you. I constantly think about you, to a pain in my heart. It's like my heart is melting because of you. Every day I live with this thought. With great inner tension. I have remembered one moment from my trip there. When we arrived at the hotel, I walked in the door and we looked at each other. Account: 101-103. You have to be careful. Walters passes to Jovaysh, he throws a three-pointer... It's in! Everything is over! Greeks are European champions. They won two victories against Yugoslavia and against the USSR! With a population of only 8.5 million, Greece prevailed over a giant with a population of 251 million Truly, David's victory over Goliath. This is probably my last delivery to you. Coffee, cassette and book. More Ballantine's whiskey and a Marlboro block. We'll see you soon, so get down to business. First. If you can, bring any book or magazine about the state apparatus and government. The most interesting of all is the one about the Country-Leviathan. It is fine if it is in Russian, it does not matter. Second. Costas became interested in photography. Do they have cheap developer and photo paper in there? I think this is a good hobby, do you agree? Third. Plates: Rossini's Barber of Seville, ours crashed "Scheherazade" by Rimsky-Korsakov, "Night on Bald Mountain" by Mussorgsky, "Gayane, Dance with Sabers" by Khachaturian, Something Shostakovich's famous and whatever you want. If you do not find it, we will survive. At 20:05 on the ERT channel New American Dream TV series. This is all important news. I kiss you on the lips and forehead. At the end of the letter, you write that you love me. Are you sure? We wish you a good night. Because I don't know if I love you. All I know is that I'm obsessed with you. BASED ON THE LETTERS OF ANFI
