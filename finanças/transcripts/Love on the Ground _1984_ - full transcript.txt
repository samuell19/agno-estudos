LOVE ON THE GROUND Sometimes, on Sunday evenings... Let's go. Hello, darling! I'm dead. Help me with this. Is that all? How romantic! Why aren't you at the office? I've done the shopping. You never do. What's the matter? Nothing. It's my lumbago. At your age? How funny. What are you hiding? From you? We have no secrets, remember? Of course. Wait! Didn't you want to tell me something? Lots of things, but you might give me a hand first. Despite your lumbago. Not so loud! You're hiding something. Are you mad, Arthur? Why don't you answer? You deliberately didn't buy any whisky. This isn't whisky. It's not whisky? Not in the play, bastard. Silvano! Arthur! It's the same brand from the same place. It doesn't taste the same. Stop, it's ten o'clock in the morning! Are you mad? It's a mess, Emily. Your lumbago? No, the other one. I mean... a double lumbago. It's serious, Elizabeth. You don't realize... Shit. "That I love you..." That I love you more than anything, and... "if I drink..." If I drink, it's because I'm lovesick... Love, perfectly! And I'll prove it to you! What are those? Abargain. Darling! Go and try them in my study. They're wonderful. I'm not sure about the size. No, in my study! Talking to yourself? I've been thinking, my love... I've made a big decision. Abig decision? I'm not going to work today. You can't do that! Come into the kitchen. Help me carry all this. Quickly. What's that? I've been shopping. In your pajamas? My shoes! Where are they? Questions! You're all the same. - My shoes! - In the kitchen, there. They're not my size, Arthur. It's a mess... You got us into this! Roquemaure is here: We have to be good. I thought I recognized that face. It's your play, Silvano! It's not really. What? It's a kind of adaptation. I assure you I've heard that somewhere. I invent! I keep inventing! I'm inhabited by... visited by, but... What are you doing? Lying down? I'm listening! I haven't budged a toe in the past two hours! I'm nothing but one big cramp! What about me? I could say as much! Anatole, stop! Come to bed. - Come to bed. - Impossible. - Anatole... - Impossible. Come to bed. Impossible. Impossible! Arthur, talking to yourself? No, I'm singing! I told you not to disturb me. I can't find my shoes. Who is talking? Who is there? No one! No one is talking. It's... an echo. An echo that calls you Arthur? The new chambermaid. A pest! You're on first name basis? She calls me Arthur because of her brother. Ahorrible drama. I'll explain, but not right now. Ahorrible drama? What are you talking about? I'm not talking, it's an illusion! Ahorrible illusion. Ahorrible illusion? Illusion! I'm an illusion. You're an illusion. Thou art an illusion. Oh, if all this could... Shit! '"T ake heed of perjury, thou art on thy deathbed." I've heard that before. Othello's last words to Desdemona. It makes you thirsty. Haven't you finished? Everything is finished. Let me drink! Let me drink! Let him drink. Who are you? We've been jumping through hoops and this clown is cracking the whip. I can't believe it! I'm dreaming! "Run for your life'" Insurance Co. Nine to twelve. Elizabeth. Genevieve... Two to five thirty. I've something for you. - Here. - Here. Wait. Don't leave me alone. Elizabeth! Genevieve! I love you! You're the only one I love! It's too late! I did mornings, you afternoons. Now it's night. Put your shoes on. Let's have dinner. Who's inviting whom? We'll take turns. It's my last time. Me too. It's sabotage. It's suicide. Clear out, you drunk! Excuse me. My compliments on your free interpretation. Our free what? I found the small changes you made very amusing. Making Albert a drunkard, the happy end... I liked it. It was free and natural. Speaking as the playwright, believe me, I'm sincere. The playwright? I understand. Let's discuss this further in private. Tomorrow at noon. You don't want to sue us? It could be important. I'm counting on you. You think, ifwe don't go tomorrow, he'll send witnesses? Hey! We left Silvain inside. Tough... teach that crook a lesson. Crook and coward. Drunk. Liar. - Thief. - Assassin! His play... What play? So, that Monday, around noon... Anybody here? Anybody here? He's expecting me. Mr... Clement, I suppose. He'll make you wait a little. Paul. Charlotte. Haven't we met? No, but it could be arranged. What is it? I thought... Like in a mirror... I must be tired. Made it at last. Cozy... Finished your dubbing? Two more days. Mornings. It's been going on so long! Post-synchronization? Yes, French into English. Do you mind? You're still here? I thought you'd left. Just leaving. See you soon. You've got... Where? I'll take it off. That's clever. I thought you'd cut it out of your act. Where did it go? Vanished... flown away. Ladies... All yours. You came without your partner. No matter. I suppose he's sleeping it off. To avoid any misunderstanding: This minor pilfering, pinching a juvenile work I'd forgotten about which thanks to you I rediscovered... Don't worry. I've done worse myself. Nevertheless... On the other hand... I mean... in exchange... I have here something I've just written, which I'd be delighted to see you in. This "theatre at home" idea seems very attractive to me. I've decided the performance should take place here. Here? We're not short of room. It's a sort of comedy... for three parts. It's what you're used to. It's what you're used to. We'll need your partner. I've decided to stage it myself. We'll rehearse here. You'll be paid properly, in cash, hand to hand. Anything to say? No, nothing. It's perfect. One detail: We have little time. We'll only hold one performance. Saturday evening. - This Saturday? - This Saturday. I'm sure it can be done. Here's the play... except for the last act. I'm not happy with the ending. What do you think? Two drinks, she can't speak French! I don't get one thing. Only one? Nothing. The whole play. What does he want from us? I don't know, but it's fun! Why call us both for one female part? To choose. I hate examinations. An audition is different. Worse. We shouldn't compete. We've seen worse. Roquemaure won't make us quarrel. Anyway, it's a part for you, Barbara is just like you: Excessive, impulsive... ready for any whim... It's you! Philadelphia-bred, like you. I don't care. I don't like them, or the place. I don't agree. The phony with the dove! I hate people who have things up their sleeves, doves, grandmothers, anything... It didn't impress me at all. I bet he has other things up there. You can have him. And Mr. Death's Door... Mr. Roquemaure... He thinks he's the bee's knees. Maybe he is. What? You've fallen for him? Worse than that. Here we go again. I like you but you're crazy. Pardon me, ladies. Excuse me. Mr. Roquemaure sent me for you. - Right now? - Already? Yes, please. - Both of us? - Of course. He wants you to come and stay for a week, during rehearsals. Separate rooms. With bathroom? Naturally. We leave at once? Please. You go. You too. You too. Take my bag, it's better than your old suitcase. Ljust wanted... - It's not time yet. - No, but... Will we sleep all right? If one has nightmares, the other is near by. I thought it would be bigger. Just like home. He could have... Pardon me, ladies. You're expected downstairs. If you need anything, don't hesitate. We're neighbors. Don't worry, I'm very discreet. Like a pussycat... It's my motto. A pussycat? He might get in the way. Which one do you want? Heads or tails? No, no need. Excuse me. I'm sure I forgot it here. What? You know, Clement and I, we work late. So, once in a while, I sleep here. There! I found my jewels. You are the actresses invited by Clement? Bravo. I won't disturb you any longer. See you. Who does she think she is? I already saw her somewhere. Wasn't she with Roquemaure The day of the show? Oh no, I don't think so. What do we decide? I don't know. You take the green. As I was already in pink, a red room, it won't change much. Well, your dress matches. It's actually pretty. "If your singing is like your plumage... "I shall be the Phoenix to these woods'guests." You know it too... He has room. He's an intellectual. I hope he's not there. - Look. - What? Is Roquemaure a Scorpio? I think he's a Virgo. Do you hear that noise? Sounds like a zoo. I can't hear a thing. You're deaf. It's shut tight. It's getting louder. - I can't see anything. - Let me. Can you see? It's gone quiet. It's empty. Falling apart... It's not that way. I'll see if it's all the same. Don't be rude! He's waiting. I think this door is closed. It's closed. There's nothing here. It's over there. I didn't hear you. Pussycat. Like a pussycat... Congratulations. You always pick them well. Charming. No comments. Are the rooms to your liking? Yes. Very colorful. - I took the red room. - Perfect. There you are. Finished your nap? I never sleep, I meditate. That's what I meant... Do you mind a little test? It depends what kind. There... Two men are in love with you. You sleep equally with both, but unable to choose, you leave them. Here's the test: You write a farewell letter. What do you say? I'd say nothing. I wouldn't write. When it's over, it's finished. See you, ciao! - And you? - Me? I know what I'd say. We'll hear you later. Don't let her distract you. I know. "I've gone away for good. "Don't call or leave a message. "No matter where I go. "Fighting over me like dogs, "you've made me a shadow. "You can keep it, "to playwith if you wish. "I'm vanishing. "If dreams... "as somebody said, "are the revenge of all you despise, "the reproach of those left behind, "I hope you never dream of me. "Adieu." Thank you. I think that'll do. Pardon me? The part is yours. I said Barbara was for you. Actually, I would have written a beautiful one but I won't tell you my life story! But you're staying with us. There's a character part for you: Pierre. He's a man! Precisely, a character part. Here's our good friend, the performing writer... Come in. No luggage? Virgil will show you your room. No thanks. I'm not staying. - Don't like it here? - Yes. But I'm a man of habit and like to be free. He likes to be free. I don't force people. We start tomorrow at ten. Is eleven alright? I'm dubbing... That's what I said: Eleven. Would you like a drink? Eleonore, would you do something for me? See the Rastels and cancel. I've got some work to do. O.K. "I'm vanishing", quote. I'll do the same. - I can drive you home. - No, thanks, I prefer the Metro. Eleven tomorrow, Silvano. A last drink. Why a last one? Working tonight? Invite Emily. She's seen the dove. Show her the rest. You're the better conjuror! Don't make it seem like a duty. I've got it: I take care of Emily. Now I'm going to another table. What do you see? Two people side by side. Could you be more precise? A man on the left, a woman on the right. You see very clearly tonight. Could I have... more details? They're not that young, but very charming. Madame's beige outfit and pink scarf are lovely. I agree... One thing is still not clear. Concentrate. Silence, please. Madame is married, but I'm afraid Monsieur is not. Listen, don't argue, you've no excuse. - It's not true! - Justine! I did it as we said! I have to keep repeating myself... Last time I didn't wait, you're still mad! You should've waited! "Their first trip to France." How could you know? First and last! They never come back to this joint. Once they've seen you... You want me to go into a trance? Well, I'm sorry. I'm normal! If you miss your Beatrice... Go and look for her! Careful what you say... You don't frighten me and you don't make me dream! Find yourself another medium! If I want to talk about Beatrice, I will. Leave it to me. Thank you. It was fun. Goodnight. One moment. Are you disappointed? Cross? Cross? Why? The lousy act and the argument. You think I'm an oaf. That's your right. It's not my business. Your act isn't so bad, I know more about it than you think. Really? I won't tell you my life story. But I want to hear all about you. I don't believe you. I always say what I think. I've noticed. You always say what you think. May I come in? I'm so tired! Funny guy, that Paul. Funny guy, that Paul. His humor is gloomy. And I think he knows it. Maybe before, it was better for him. And then... there was Beatrice. Looks like she meant a lot to him, Beatrice. It's his big regret. He is so disarming. Like a child... an adolescent. Awkward and clumsy. I like his mouth. I like his mouth when he smiles. And he smiles all the time. But, it's a mask. Yes, it's a mask. Beneath it, he's fragile. Hurt... broken. And, he doesn't want to talk about Beatrice. Cannot... Charlotte, you think I can help him? I'm mad! I'm speaking to myself. Then, Tuesday at dawn... Wake up. I'm having a beautiful dream. That's what I want to talk about. What are you doing in my dream? Not yours, mine. Something wonderful has happened, it was just like a dream. You know I need my coffee first... Make an effort. I'm Barbara. I know you are. No, it's really me. If Clement invented her, he needed her. It's someone he dreams about. Someone who shares his hopes, who understands his silences, who would bring him passion... Passion? His passion, his secret passion, the one he fears and desires... Not to love and to have lost all hope, I know what it means. He's been too Ionely, too desperate to look. He met me. I'm his Barbara, flesh and bones... Bones more like it, if you don't eat. Listen... we started by talking. And then, we talked closer, looking in each other's eyes. And then, I couldn't hear his words. Close, one against the other. We were together. If you ask me how it happened, I wouldn't know how to say it. I'd forgotten caresses. Or I was afraid, or... maybe I was ashamed. But, little by little, I... found the gestures again! And the words. Like anyone. How could I have been so crazy not to understand I was dying for that? So many years... to avoid seeing the people I could meet ...or to lose those who could love me. So many years to forget dreams reminding me of love. But this night, I was lighthearted, I laughed. I cried a little, too. I became a woman again, I can't believe it! Sorry. I forgot my script. "Auspicious week for your love life. "Harmony needs to be found. "Discuss constructively. Learn to listen. "Accept all invitations. "Mixed family influences. Taurus positive." I don't know anyTauruses. Mixed influences? Troppman! No, you go out that way. Faster, please. Don't drag out the words. It needs to be heard from outside. Come in and speak immediately. She didn't see me. Nerves on edge, incredibly irritated... If love is a sickness, I love being sick. You come back in, Charlotte, and you behind. - I don't believe in it. - What's he doing? Who? Paul. He's not here to play in the park. As you're not on now, could you get Paul? It's not my job. AskVirgil. You're right. If I get carried away, stop me. She did. Where were you? We need you. Come in. I'm listening. Do I have to? Yes, you do. Well, let's start. And faster, Charlotte, right? Mixed influx... I don't believe in it but am worried. Why worry? I have no reason to worry. My days are calm. Maybe I force myself to worry to please him. He likes me worried, or is it I who likes me worried? "Worried, worried!" As I keep repeating that word, I feel I will be mad with worry! Barbara never ceases to amaze me. Getting on my nerves increases it even more. With her, all is grand! But in my trembling, I doubt. What if I started boring her? Can she love other than me? Yes, one. Has she really renounced to him? I don't know. - I'll soon know... - Talking to yourself? Looking for... I was here. Thinking. Why is it set for three? Ah, you noticed? These days, I feel you're far away, very far. I can't get near you. You hide in trivia, horoscopes... the daily news. I'm forced to look at you through a glass. But I'm here, just as before. You don't work, so you think too much. You should be in your study, writing. You used to have ideas. Go on. The past is the past. Now my only idea is Barbara. Idiot! Who is our guest? An old friend. He'll arrive any time. Stop wriggling about. An old friend of yours, or mine? Both of ours. Impossible. We have no mutual friends. Unless you mean... impossible. What's impossible? Anybody but him! Is this how you want me to act? It's for the first set up. At first, it helps to exaggerate a bit. But where do I come in from? Through the rotunda. I'm sorry, I wasn't laughing at you. I won't do it again. Have you chosen one? Once again. Anybody but him! Keep your own voice. I cancelled my Belgian tour too quickly. Maybe it's not too late. I leave right away. Stop! I'm sorry, but Belgium, it's too much! Clement..."Troppman'"! This isn't theatre, it's a photocopy! Touched up. Like painting. It's all like that? Why not keep the real names? - They are real. - What are you two talking about? I'm very happy for you... and for me. You're playing my part. Me? The best friend. The third party. Me. And you're the writer, the Master himself... Nothing but the truth: Our story! What's up? Nothing. Barbara exists too? Rather. What's her name? Beatrice. The same one... The same. What are you doing? Reading. Studying my part before dinner. Do you believe in this Beatrice? It's the play that counts. Admit it's strange... I'd like to know more. Shall we grillVirgil? He's so full of secrets, he'll burst. Coming? We'll chat him up. You can do it perfectly well on your own. Even in that. Even in that. That's not funny. Bitch! Like a pussycat... Pardon. Hello. You look comfortable. You think so? No, please. Excuse me. You're typing the end of the play? - The play! - May I look? You'll be lucky to see the end! You mean he's keeping it unfinished? I mean nothing. In fact, we didn't talk. You never came. I never saw you. I'm translating Hamlet into Finnish. I'm not Roquemaure's slave twenty four hours a day. Have you played Shakespeare? At university, long ago. Desdemona, in Othello. Not quite the same. You're an expert! Been working long for Mr. Roquemaure? So you knew Beatrice? I knew her... Very well. Very well? I didn't mean... What she needed was a great love affair. To think she lived with that clown... - Clement? - No, the other one, Paul. Do you know what he's doing up there? I want to find out why Beatrice left. Who said she'd left? Didn't she? She disappeared. Slight difference. One day, she wasn't there anymore. It's possible she left. I don't drink. Pity, it's a good year. There are no animals here? In a big house like this, I'd have dogs, cats, rabbits... I'm not fond of animals. It's true. Except for women. They're the only ones he puts up with... If they shut their mouths. Don't listen to her. Something wrong? Excuse me. What's the matter? I don't know. You have one weakness, you don't like the truth. One may be a worthy writer, and you are one. I acted in your last play, with success. But one can be completely reactionary. Clement always says: "Shut up and be beautiful". You're living proof of the contrary. Proof or not, I'm certainly alive. Too much for you? You dream of a dead woman. What do you mean? Nothing special. Clement is looking for an ideal, a statue, an idol, but unfortunately he only meets imperfect creatures like us... far too alive. It's very common. Where is Emily? I'll go see. No crab? I'd rather go out, than eat out of your hat. Am I responsible for your running away? You're not responsible for anything. That's not a compliment. It's stifling, unbearable. Eleonore has some excuse. You think so! He shouldn't say whatever he likes just because he's successful. He only says what I tell him to say. I don't understand you both. I thought you liked each other, but you don't. "There are more things in heaven..." Do you see that bright star? - Where? - Above the trees. It's the evening star. Venus. Nobody's done that since I was twelve. I'm sorry. It just happened that way. Let's go in. Who knows what they'll think. Let them think. Why don't we go eat shellfish? Not shellfish. There's a yawning gap between us. Really? I hadn't noticed. We're so close... Do you know why we're so close? Nobody gives a damn. She's dying to hear... I don't give in to him. I've never been obedient. They say men with strong personalities need strong-minded women. That's why he needs me. I'm pleased to hear it... You're tiring them with your cheap psychology. I hadn't noticed. You're tiring me. If you're tired, go to bed. That's my advice to you. Then I'll take it. I apologize... It doesn't matter. I'm not hungry anymore. Neither am I. Why doesn't the fountain work? It's been at least a year, it hasn't worked. The night watchman stopped it for his sleep. Don't move. Pretend you're dead. I'm dead. Eleonore seemed out of her mind. What do I see? That you drink more than me! Alast drop. The last. I'll remember this dinner. Alittle drop and a big drop. You must be a torturer with women... Akind of Bluebeard. That's why they run away. What are you doing? As you mentioned it... What cupboard does this key fit? None. It's the key to the house. In case you want to go out... Has Eleonore got one? Thank you. It's a precious gift. Come here, we'll be better. Oh, no. It's too low. - Sit on the ground. - No. The ceilings are too high here. My head is spinning. There's someone walking above? Monsieur Virgil... There's no one above. There is often creaking, but it's normal. No, they are not steps, more like a beat. Maybe it's in my head. Are you ever afraid in this house, full of empty rooms? I'd be terrorized. My father had a house, half as big, in Carmel, California. And I remember, at night, I was scared to death. - But you feel alright? - Sorry, it's the story. The story of a ghost. Come, I don't like ghosts. You don't like animals, you don't like ghosts... What is it? There! I saw it as I see you now. You were there too. What are you talking about? Are you going mad? I saw myself dead. You were there, looking at me. You did it. You did a trick. You enjoy scaring me? - I swear... - You're lying! I know you know! I neither knew, saw, nor did anything. What did you see? I was lying on the ground with a wound on my forehead... Go on. I can't. There was a clock. Did you hear it? Aclock? You do know! It's happened before? With how many? Just one. It's true then! It's happened before. You could've warned me. You need a label: Warning: Danger. Listen, Emily... Is the other one dead? Of course not. Nevertheless, Wednesday morning... Maybe you think I like begging? What can I do if I don't have a job? I'm out of prison! Think it's easy to find a job with a record? You tell me how to get money if I don't have a job! You don't care, do you? You don't give a damn! I know I'll screw up again, and end up in the slammer. You've already been in jail? - Me? - Yeah, you. Don't look at me that way. It could happen to you... Why are you harassing me? Just a little bill! I don't have any! Ask that man, he looks nice. No, impossible, I can't ask a man. It's really impossible. Really, men scare you? - It's a long story. - I hate long stories. Asshole. It makes you want to kill. How many men did you have in your life? Several, I bet... Me, just one. It's because of him I'm here. Ablind man... Anything for a blind man. He robs on wheels, you know? Robbing in cars. He taught me that. How can a blind man know anything about stealing? Precisely, I was going to ask. Well, imagine with him... Shit, my stop! Or else... - But, it's impossible! - What is impossible? Anybody but him! That, it's... still over dramatic. Yes. Well, you'll see. Go on. What a greeting! I shouldn't have cancelled my Belgian tour so soon. Maybe it's not too late... - I leave right away. - No, stay! Since you're here. I'm losing my mind. My dear, Pierre is surely not a ghost. It's a provocation! I'm fighting, I don't refuse, I talk, listen... To start, you should offer him a drink. Good idea, I'm dead thirsty. I'll see what's going on in the kitchen. The usual dose? Still no ice cubes? Exactly. Troppman told me you'd be delighted to see me. He was wrong... or he tricked me. He broke a pact! No fragment of the past should be here. Thanks for the fragment. Before, I was everything for you. Before is before. Cheers! Tomorrow, will be day. The night may be long, Barbara. Clovis invited me for the summer. Still not drinking? No, but I might start. Why did he do this to me? Troppman! Troppman! No need to yell. We can hear next door. We can hear next door. Pierre is staying with us for a while. Slowly dying of boredom one next to the other, my dear... We needed an electric shock. And Pierre is the electric shock. Thanks for the electric shock. Thanks for the electric shock. All said, I think I'm going to leave. You won't leave. You don't have a penny to go home, or to pay the hotel. To go back to Belgium, you're bluffing. You haven't worked for months. You're too happy here. It's a trap! It's a trap! Life starts again, Barbara. And life is war. Oh! Amot d'auteur... Cheers. I really don't understand. I don't understand anything. After only two rehearsals, it's taking shape. After only two rehearsals, it's taking shape. I'm not happy. It doesn't feel right when Pierre comes in. It feels fake. Something fake? What's fake? "Anybody but him!" "Anybody but him!" It seems forced, hammy. I can't say it. She's right. Actually... Barbara should be calm and collected, indifferent almost, no? It's me... I mean Pierre, who's upset. It's me... I mean Pierre, who's upset. It's me... You, Emily who's surprised to see her. Emily ought to say something like, "you swore she wasn't here." Yes, it's possible. Maybe... After... "We have no mutual friends", you stop and see Paul... I mean Pierre, coming. Then, you simply say"Well, well." Pierre, disconcerted: "Shit!", and Barbara, "Funny way to say hello." Let's see. Impossible. We have no mutual friends. Unless you mean... Well, well! Shit! Funny way to say hello, Pierre. Then I go on with my Belgium story? No, no, wait. I'm sorry but... Now, I don't understand anything. If Charlotte isn't moved, there's no trick fromTropppman. If Charlotte isn't moved, there's no trick fromTropppman. It doesn't make any sense! But yes, yes... Maybe it's not as funny, but a little more subtle. Wait five minutes... I'll fix it on my copy. May I have a word? Now? Impossible. We have no mutual friends. Unless you mean... Well, well! Well, well! Shit! Funny way to say hello, Pierre. I cancelled my Belgian tour too quickly. Maybe it's not too late... Cheer up. She's not a ghost... She's a provocation! She's a provocation! Always exaggerating. You're not the only one. You swore she wasn't here. I'll go see what's happening in the kitchen. Always such a coward, with his grand airs. Always such a coward, with his grand airs. Give me a drink, my throat's on fire. Only your throat? The usual dose? You remember, I see. You remember, I see. Still don't drink? I'm still the same. Yes, I've noticed. Except for one thing... In the past, I was everything. The past is the past. And vice-versa. You haven't changed... Being nice already... You haven't changed either. Good. Add what I wrote here, Emily... "I should've gotten the hell out. '"W hat is more pitiful than a magician with no will?" "Asimple illusionist without a job." It's Beatrice's room. It's Beatrice's room. Come. Why did she leave all her things if she left? Maybe she didn't take all of them. Just in case... Think it's mink? Julius Caesar... "Romans, lend me your ears..." That's pretty. Look. It's torn. Cut to ribbons. Put it back. Quickly. Let's get out of here! I have nothing to do in ActTwo. Leave something for them. There's a big empty room upstairs. Can I take my things there? No. The room must stay as it is. It's Beatrice's room? Possibly, so what? Asacred place? Awriter's superstition, if you like. You bet! I know... I know... she's the only woman you ever loved. It's all here. You know who you remind me of? Eleonore, I know. You're wrong. It's not jealousy... What then? Anxiety. Anxiety. Virgil says... I know I'm ridiculous but nothing's normal here. Virgil says she disappeared suddenly. I wonder why you keep that room in a frozen state. Why ask when you know the answer? You told me: I'm Bluebeard. If I were you, I'd look everywhere. You're bound to find Beatrice in a cupboard. In a cupboard. Unless I buried her in the garden, after cutting her up. There's a tool shed... Virgil will lend you a spade. But be careful, you don't know how I'll react when the awful truth comes out. Silly ass... Think that's funny? Where's my purse? Come in, it's you, Charlotte? Downstairs, Charlotte's affairs. And up here, I am near. Aren't you working? I've an hour to spare. Can't you see I'm working? Always so nice with your lovers? Keep away. Don't touch me. I wanted to show you something... Here, hold the cigarette, look. Look at this scarf, you see... Look at this scarf, you see... Asmall hole... Cigarette... You see? The scarf is burning. I put out the cigarette. I'm frightened of you. I don't like nightmares when I'm awake. Omens frighten me. I don't want to know. If I'm going to die, I don't want to know how, or where. I know... there'll be a clock... There's a clock here. I know you'll be there. And you're here. And you're here. I can't forget the girl in red: Like Death taking me by the hand... How can you do things like that? I don't know, believe me. I can't help it! I transmit it in spite of myself. Like a disease? Yes, like a disease, yes. So it happens to all the girls you're with? Not all. Only the important ones. Like you. Only the important ones. Like you. Like Beatrice? How do you know? Yes, like Beatrice. She didn't like nightmares when she was awake either. She didn't like nightmares when she was awake either. That's why she left with Clement? Maybe. I'm sure he thinks it's his charm... He's not short of it... With Beatrice, that lousy act you saw was great. She genuinely saw things. No but, it's not true! It's a trick. It's not real. It's real because you are... Amedium too? You mean I can move tables, talk to the spirits? The only thing I know is she saw things I didn't. But I made her see them. It's true then? I'll die here? That's absurd. What you saw doesn't mean... Don't muddle me! I saw it, not you. It's only a door... Please, go away. No, go away! Go, please. Hey, miss! You haven't paid! She owes me forty five francs. Two very strong coffees! You won't talk? Well, don't talk. Listen to me. Yes. You'll listen! Your misfortune, I don't want to know. Tonight, it's about me. Me and Marc. We lived together in New York. We worked together. I made up perfume formulas and he sold them. Then, one day, I found it, my'"W erewolf". Three weeks later, he disappeared with the formula, leaving me a few words: "You're too pretty to imitate nature, leave it to me. "I love you." I came back to Paris to find him and to understand. What I understood, he didn't want me anymore. And I was not strong enough to take back my rights. "Werewolf", the perfume's name. It's very successful. And I'm left empty-handed and heartbroken. You drink too much, Charlotte. I drink because I like it! I like it, I love it! "You drink too much, Charlotte! '" But I love... I love him a little, a lot, passionately, not at all. Alittle... Anyway, love bores me! It bugs me! Shush! You love, you share, you've made love, you're in bed... Then, you put your arm round his neck, feel for his hand... some affection, a last kiss... he's snoring. I wonder if Clement snores. Do you snore, Clement? Do you snore? Alittle, a lot, passionately, or not at all? He snores a little. They all do... It bugs me! I'll give you a kiss... You bore me! I hate children. Now it's alreadyThursday... Check. Can you go on? Only my body is drunk. My mind is clear. It checks your moves. I split myself in two. You say you're drunk, but like that, nobody will notice. May I interfere? Pierre's not drunk... He is. I insist. O.K. If you prefer, he's only pretending. It doesn't make sense. Why? To tellTroppmann something he couldn't... when sober. Understand? So he's not drunk. He's pretending. How will the audience know? I know it's your job, but whenTroppmann goes out... couldn't Pierre change? When Barbara comes in... Possibly... Clever boy! Am I absolutely necessary now? Not now, no. I'll be back. Check. - Can you go on? - Don't know! "Last night's wind knocked Cupid down." And you're burying him. Don't tell Clement it was me. I'm so ashamed... He won't even notice. I feel like a cat. Let me help you. How did you? It was very easy. It was very easy. I wanted to look Cupid in the eyes... I thought it was stuck on but it fell off! It immediately... sobered you up. I'm a medium who doesn't see anything, but who guesses a lot. So, in your opinion, will he be furious, discovering there's no Cupid anymore? Let me concentrate... He'll murder you. It was worthless! Clement only attaches value... to women. And not just any. As long as I've known him, that old Clement, there's one thing that makes him... He loves passionate women Passionate! Desired by another man. Beatrice never understood. If there's not another man there, who's mad for the woman he loves... Poor Clement gets bored. And Cupid... I see you have more than one string to your bow, Paul. Don't you know? You never mention string on stage! Help me out, I'm hungry. My wife left me. He wasn't blind. He pretended. Not only he wasn't blind, but had a wandering eye. That's how I finally got on to it. As we pass by an elegant girl, he says: "Even seam stockings are back in fashion." And I robbed for him. Because of his dark glasses. I was in prison for two years. I could talk about prison. What would you have done, in my shoes? I don't know. It never happened to me. You never got taken by a man? I would've asked for it. Aman forcing me to do things for him. Even forbidden things. But they never ask me anything. I don't know why, but I always end up with Pisces. Pisces? Yes. Even with Aquarius rising, or Cancer, they're still Pisces. Slippery. They slip through your fingers like trout. The strangest thing, I know one who was eaten by a lion. - Of the sign of the Lion? - No! No, a real lion in a real circus. It was horrible. To have a fake blind as boyfriend is tough. But a real seer, is even worse. Especially when he sees nothing. I'm the one who sees. I'm not sure I understand. Neither do I, that's the worst. Good luck. Could you explain it better? Too painful. Dirtyfingernails. Not so loud... the Master is scribbling. He can't stand noise when he's working. He can't stand anything. I made a big mistake about him. I'm too naive. I thought... I won't tell you my life story. Why not? I'll start crying. After three days, I no longer know who I am or what I'm doing. Do nothing. Give in. Don't mind me. '"I 'm too naive'"! Well played, old girl! You were listening? You're disgusting! I'm disgusting? Don't come near! I'll scratch your eyes out! What's that row? You'd do anything to annoy me! Where's he hiding again? That's the last straw. I'll go and pack. I'll help. Here. This will do you good. My sister... She pretended she was my sister, my big sister... Now you have a brother. You're the most beautiful sunset ever! The sun's thirsty! Anger is like love. Up close, one sees one eye, the other is blurry. I see the two eyes in focus. My mother liked to party. Yes! And I, Iwas a stripper. Yes. You want me to show you, huh? You want me to show you? This, this, this! I hated her, yes! No, you're tired, you're sick. Come, lie down on the bed. Pale face, you won't have my scalp. Moving once again... Don't think about it. Emily asked for it. I'd never hit a woman, nor a man... Yes, David, once... Abad guy, that David... Not at first... At university, I acted, and he wrote plays. People had heard of him. We met at a gallery opening. We looked, we touched... Suddenly we were in the storeroom making love against the paintings. I fell in love with him. He was intense, violent... Indecent. David was America... It wasn't only him. After my divorce, ljoined Women's Lib. I left them for the Black Panthers, then the Indians... Wounded Knee, Brown rice... Stalin, a sleep cure, brown rice. After London, Paris, Mao, a sleep cure again, more brown rice... Still brown rice. Not enough eggs. Go and get some! I'm hungry. That's how he died! When the lions get hungry, they eat the tamer. I don't want to die. Is that enough? I'll wring your neck, Charlotte... So gently... you wouldn't believe... Are there enough onions? Are there enough onions? Oh me, I don't know. I'm not hungry, you can have it. All is well, Charlotte. Tomorrow"is another day"! That's what David would say when we lived on Broadway. On the second floor, as he had vertigo. At night, we'd drink, go down to the street. Act like drunks. But one day, Dave fell and never got up. - He was dead? - No! But that night, I discovered he was cheating. He drank a lot of ice water between scotches, and the ice cubes... they were frozen vodka! And the more he drank, the more he feared the light. We moved from the second floor to the ground floor. Then from the ground floor to the basement. - What an act! - Ah, no! In the basement, we had fun. He wrote a play for me. He'd caress me. We made love all the time. He touched me... "A part to your standing", he'd say, "my love". Let me discover you. One night, I was sleeping, He called out:'"Charlotte!" Laughing like a madman. He was dead drunk in the bathtub. There were pieces of paper floating around him, and he told me: "Here is your part! "Your best part! "How could have I been so mad to give you to the public! "Your part is ours. "Join me, "my sadness." I slammed the door and left to a hotel. It wasn't the first time. He had the knack to find me. I got a telegram. "No woman's tears "taste like yours. "I'm missing salt. "Come back." I would return. It's banal. It's banal. He was with another woman, younger than me. He loved both of us. Her, for her body, and me for my tears. We became a threesome. I was overwhelmed by her sweetness and patience. In the end, I was in a corner of the bed and... I watched... And I let go. My life doesn't revolve around men! Why does a life... One New Year's eve, I was alone at home... One New Year's eve, I was alone at home, listening to the rain fall on the sidewalk. It was a very pleasant sound. And I listened to it. Rain falls for all. Even me. I like light. The other... was an equi... - Was an equilibrist. - What else? Equilibrist, dancer. We loved some and then... one day he lost... he lost his equilibrium. Just like that. You don't wonder why I wear... these ballerinas? Because you're tall. Yes, I am tall! I am tall. Well, I'm too tall! I'm too tall to do pirouettes. And... no heels. But, the next morning... These flowers... These flowers... These flowers... Shit! "Smell rotten." These flowers smell rotten. May I have a script? "These flowers smell rotten. Change them." It's not the hardest line. Then, we'll change. As you know the part, Emily, you can be Barbara until Charlotte wakes up. You can be Barbara until Charlotte wakes up. And if I don't? Emily keeps it. These flowers smell rotten. Change them. You're not any better. When did you begin? When the other came to see me every night, and you began your new work. All right? Going as you like it? It's fine. Good, if the situation inspires you. What is happening here? Pierre andTroppman are married now? Who is talking? No one. And maybe Silvano will be Barbara, or Virgil. At least in rehearsals, we'll see. Sunday... I'm ready. Let's go. You can hardly see it. - Does it hurt? - Alittle. Keep your hand there, it feels nice. Maybe you're the one I like best. Let's get out of here. Leave them in their mess. Impossible. I don't care about them, I need the money. Still playing poker? In debt? And they're not joking. This damn life just slips through your fingers. Those are the rules: Either you have everything, or you are down in the gutter. I didn't even get the part. Now all I've got is this on my head and the jitters. About what? The girl in red... Well, you won't understand... Hug me tight. I can't think about it. You need a little something to buck you up. Just thinking about it makes me sick. Alove affair then? With you? Acard player? True. I'm not in the mood for laughing. Recite some things. You know so many pretty ones. I feel like quitting. Everything is so big here, even the trees... I bet they have owls. I don't mind. I don't see them. But time... Time here is strange. I've been here for ever... Alifetime anyway. The setting goes to our heads. Right time to say it. I didn't want to tell you... Maybe my nerves are on edge... Maybe I'm too tired, but... Well, speak! Paul makes me see things... But he told me... Before or after? After what? What things? Debauchery. The bastard! I don't know if he realizes. I do! Tomorrow, it will all be over. We'll go home... and forget. You think you could? Easily. You realize tomorrow we're doing a play we don't know the end of! Do you think Clement will leave it open? It's his play. I'm only acting in it! And then came Saturday night... I'm happy to see you. It's my first play since... which you didn't produce. I am all the more curious. Come, come, my dear friends... You're probably wondering, "Where's that joker Roquemaure leading us now? '" Let's say it's a guided tour... not of the house, which all of you know, or think you know, but of its other side. Tonight, my house has an extra wing leading to a stage. People think I make things up, but... I only tellwhat I've seen, heard, experienced... Not truer than life, but true to life. This way, the show is beginning. Auspicious week for your love life. Harmony needs to be found. Learn to listen. Discuss constructively. Accept all invitations. Cheers! It's not theatre, it's exhibitionism... It's a scandal! Calm down, we're his guests. Poor Eleonore... Beyond the pale, no limits! Check! I take your queen. Take it. What's the horoscope? Your best cure: Sleep. Your rook is threatened. And my glass is empty. Check! Can you go on? Only my body is drunk. My mind is clear and I see all your moves. I can split at will. I'm gliding, my friend! I'm gliding above us. You're gliding, that's for sure. In the meantime, your rook wavers. You're so smart, Clovis! You'll always be the smartest, that's it, that's it... that makes me sad. Check. It's ugly, it's so ugly! What is so ugly? I know you don't believe me, but I... I care for you and I think... I care for you and I think... No one can have as much affection for you than me. Even... even Barbara. You don't know... how much she loves you, Barbara. How much we both love you. You know nothing. - You really find it absurd? - Not I. You know nothing. And yet... and yet, you love me a lot, both of you. What is so ugly? She's cuckolding you to the hilt, my friend. That's what's ugly. And you know what's even uglier? What? It's with me. Checkmate. Look after Pierre, he needs putting to bed. That was disgusting. I had to say it. There was no other way. Weeks, months, years of quiet shattered. Let's get out of here. No, stay. I want your mouth, Barbara. That's it, he's mad. Troppmann will come any minute. He knows all about us... I want you, now! "What you secretlyfear always happens." Where did I read that? No matter. I played against myself and won. Dear friends, follow me... The show continues. It's disgraceful! Do something! - Otherwise I'll stop it. - Don't bother. It's too late. He's mad. Kovacs! He's going under. Me with him! To feel he's right he needs everybody against him. You realize? Doing that to me, here? Calm down, it won't end the way he thinks. How do you know? I know. Do I have to shout? Type that properly, not like last time. Wait! What's that stupid smile for? Me, smiling? All the time, for a week. With your sickly cheeks and bilious eyes, it makes you look like a vicious cretin. Try to correct that. I'll try. Others prefer Vitamin C. I insult people. I need a thousand francs. What for? We're out of drink. That much? These flowers smell rotten. Change them. You don't get any better. No, I don't. How long have you been at it? Since Pierre's been seeing me every night, and you started writing. Is it going well? Not badly. I'm glad we inspire you. But things could change... Threats? I could fall sick, die. You don't care. You'd change the end. I dreamt I was your last book, all moldy and rat-eaten. I was in a strange-shaped wooden box... Excellent! No need to say which. No need to say which. It smells like blackmail. It smells like shit, asshole. It'll kill me. I don't eat or sleep, all I do is make love... The word is foul, the thing even worse. Luckily there's vodka... Thank you for the money. "The word is foul, "the thing even worse." Athousand francs for vodka. The worst is yet to come. Here's the Fourth Act. Already? You'll find the directions there. See what I've got to say here? We'll do what we have to. The nerve! Impossible. She must have left a note, saying where... I've gone away for good. Don't call or leave a message. No matter where I go. Fighting over me like dogs, you made me a shadow. You can keep it, to play with if you wish. I'm vanishing. No going back. We're on our own. I'm not worried about you. You have your work, and hordes of readers. For me, the last thread has broken. I often thought of this moment, here we are. Life, what a mess! Good night. Stop, you fool! It's too late! Clement, what's this dire melodrama? You've been in better form. I'm not a shadow yet... Beatrice! Am I disturbing you? It's my room. The girl in red! Water! She's bleeding. The ending calls for it. What ending? Am I dead or not? It's for you to decide. I'm glad for you. This is yours. I've no key, but I do owe you one thing, darling... You'll miss the best part. I've laughed enough... Stay, now I'm the director. For me the comedy is over. Changed your mind? We haven't been paid! Perfect. Charlotte stays here. Between Clement and I, endlessly hesitating. Visions of future fights... As for Emily... What if she left with Beatrice? That would be nice. They're bound to each other... That's how it should be. There's no other way. There's no other way. In cash and hand to hand. And Emily's. There. - May I? - Yes. Be careful! It's true... Medium... One of his big words. Paul's visions are like his act, they never hurt anybody. I couldn't know. Sorry. I'll leave you... Feeling better? This is for you. It closes the account. If you like, but I intend to pay him back for his play. I don't understand. The usual dose? No ice? You remember, I see. I'm still the same. Except for one thing... In the past, I was everything. You still are. You promised to stop drinking. But I realize it's not an easy thing to say... What's not? You don't dare... You wouldn't dare? "What a drama if she came back". He's been saying that for weeks. Sorry to be frank, I prefer things out in the open. I'm delighted you came back, a shadow would be cast between Clement and I. She's raving. I don't think so. But, he's a weak person, but I don't care. It's so extraordinary to be loved, understood! And he's a lover so... I forgive him everything. And he takes advantage. You like it, don't you? Enough of this joke! Ajoke! You really are the same. My absence hasn't changed you. Beatrice, at last! You missed your last chance! There. There what? You ought to see Clement now. It's funny... I don't care anymore. You don't care for me? For you? I told you I'd finish it. You're there in my ending. With me. Not very original. Atraditional happy end. Do you agree? So much for tradition! We'll miss you... Goodbye, ladies. Don't worry, as long as I'm here, things will run smoothly. As long as I go on improving Roquemaure's plays, the rat will be successful... As long as the columns hold up the building, it won't fall down! Subtitles: Arce-Kime-Lvoff. SubtitlingTitra Film Paris
