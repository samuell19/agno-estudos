Hello. Do you know what kind of cup it is? Yes, it's china. But when comparing to the ordinary one, it's more translucent and more vitality. Because it was made of the ashes of living bones, so as it is named, Bone China. You just came back from a business trip in Japan, why take me on vacation? Don't you tired? Just because I am tired and need to go for a vacation, and I wanna make up for not being around with you these days. Jia-jia, this way. Hello. - Hi. - Have a sit. Okay, thanks. You are so late. Forget it. I just met a client, he is a film maker. When the first time I went to the set, I found them in a mess. While I tried to talk to the client, here comes the heroine. It is my favorite actress Zhou Hai-mei. So I just stood aside and watched. Hold still. Don't scream. Or, I'll kill you. What do you want? I'm not here to make a fortune, nor to kill anyone. Then, what do you want? I want you to marry me, or... Or what? I won't get married forever. Well, then. Yes, I do. That's great, honey. You finally said yes. Great! Nice! First of all, thank you all for coming today to join our wedding anniversary party. I'd like to take this opportunity to say to my loved one that I have no regrets in this life having you. It turned out to be a romance film, which really moved me. I even forgot to ask for an autograph. By the way, our company has an activity next week, both of you should remember to come. Next week? But we are going on vacation next week, there is time clash. Oh, no! I got to go, I'm late for work. - I will go with you. - Stay. Youu haven't seen Jia-jia for a long time. She just arrived and haven't eaten anything yet. Stay for a while with her. Be good, dear. Don't worry, it's not the taste of bones, just because the coffee is bad. Some people say that bone china symbolizes the eternity of life so if one day... I mean if, if I die... What happened? Did he move in with you? Died. No, impossible! Miss, don't hinder our work. Let go of me. Do you know who he's to me? Do you know how important this day is to me? With my ashes, I wish to be made as a vase for your flower arrangement, so that I can be with you every day. Qing-wen. Qing-wen, you've come back. I thought I'd never see you again. Sorry to make you sad, I swear I'll never leave you again. Okay? I trust you. Qing-wen, I love you. I love you too. That's right, I want to fulfill his last wish, to use his ashes to make bone china. - It's quite artistic. - Yes, it sounds pretty fun. Jia-jia, have you heard of the bone china? Yeah, it seems to be the porcelain made of animal bones. What's going on? Have you ever heard of it? It was made from human bones, I read about it in the novel, but shouldn't you be... Bingo. Let's go. Leave... We don't take this deal. How could you have such request, leave now. - Get off. - No, not that... We won't take such order here, leave now. - I meant to say... - We won't do this. Please leave. Go. - Hello, boss. - Hi. I want to make a bone china vase with my relative's ashes. - Could you help me? - Yes, no problem. We have been doing the ceramics for decades, but I have never tried bone china before. I'm glad that you gave this opportunity to me. But sorry, maybe next time. Let's go... "Royal Restaurant" Honey, we have went to more than a dozen stores. My feet hurt now, yet none of them are willing to do it. I told you before, using human ashes is not feasible. Jia-jia. About that blue and white vase, do you feel something strange? Something strange? Isn't it just an ordinary vase? Do you feel that as if it has vitality? Vitality? Don't be kidding. Excuse me. Hi, what can I do for you? Could you tell me that who made that blue and white vase? A crazy guy who Lives in our backyard. Crazy guy? He lives here, you can get in. Okay, thanks. Hello, is anybody home? Let me give it a try. Anyone home? Trash, all trash. What an artist is this? He indeed is a madman. Let's leave now. Since we are here, why should we go? Aren't you looking for someone to make the Bone China? How do you know? It's just a small street where words pass quickly. Well, even better, I've explained enough for today. Just tell me you take it or not. Come on, let's go. It depends on what kind of ashes does it use. By dog ashes. Fine, I'll take it. Then name a price. I never make it for money. Otherwise, you will only make those trash like I just threw away. No way you can believe him, what a holding aloof. No... Then what are you really for. Existence. When I devote myself to making one of them, I can feel the presence of my life. That means I don't have to pay you, right? When you see the finished product and think it's worthless, by all means. He's really insane, I think we'd better go. So what are your ideas on the design? No idea, but I will hesitate for a few days to feel and conceive what I am going to do. Until the time to start, I will create it by feeling. Experience has taught me that only works created in this moment can truly express my heart. Please try to feel it. Do you feel anything? I felt that in addition to ashes, it was full of love. All right, then. Let me tell you the truth. It is not the ashes of a dog, but... of my beloved one. I know, you'd end up like them and not taking this order. Give it back to me. I will not take back what I've said. But do you have experience with making bone china. Yes, once. It is made for my most precious dog, that one in the teahouse. How long it can be done. I'll send it to you when I'm done. No way, do you really trust him? Deal, but I will inspect it by myself. Sure, wait for my message. Can you tell me why it has to be bone china? Because... Do you know how important today is to me? Qing-wen. Come on, look at me. Let me help you. Wake up. Please wake up. Don't leave me alone! Please save him! Please... I still can't believe that he was gone. Maybe it wasn't an accident, but an intentional murder. Yes, it must be... Alright, let it go. Qi-hua, stop guessing. The autopsy has come out, he did die of accidental drowning. Besides, he has no grudges against others, who would kill him deliberately? These are the belongings left by him. Except for the cell phone, the rest are here. Just take an inventory. - Let's go for a walk. - Okay. It's Jia-jia. You go ahead. I'm in heaven now. Don't stimulate me with your happiness. Be careful that I will leave my work and be your third wheel right away then. Come on, then. By the way, there is a good news. Sure, it is the intuition of woman. Well, then. Let's talk about it over dinner tonight. Great. He might propose to me today. Honey, does this look good on me? Really? Of course. What's wrong? I can't wait till tonight, I want to hear it from you now. Wait till evening. Qi-hua. I want to go to the sauna, so you may take a nap after the shower. I will come pick you up to a romantic dinner I prepared for you then. Okay? Alright, do come back quickly then. Otherwise, I'll miss you. But, that night... He even prepared the ring. Why? Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off... Hello, Miss. Are you in room 512? Yes. Can you come out for a while? What's going on? How can you be so cruel to me! Don't leave me... Let me go! Qi-hua, help me! Help me! Let go of him. Let go of him! Do you know? They say that... If a whole skin can be kept after peeling the apple, you can see your future wife. So is your future wife right in front of you now? Hello. Hello. How are you? Busy or not? Still the same. How about you? Getting fatter? No, How's this possible? You are not with me. I can't sleep well and eat well. Maybe I even lose weight. It seems to. So heartbreaking. The doll behind you is so beautiful. Well, wait. The bone china is finished, are you ready for it? Since the night he left me, I've had nothing more to mentally prepare for. Bone porcelain vase? Is it really done? Open it and have a look. It's very pretty. Didn't you say on the phone that it had regret? What regret? Take a look at the back. Some accidents occurred during the production, so there left flaws on one side. Based on the error in this process, I decided not to charge you. You can take back the money, let this vase be a gift for you. It is strange. Qing-wen. I am afraid of you being sunburned, let me give you a turn face. Maybe I remember it wrong? I'll be back with you after work. I know you like to sunbathe, but you will be sunburned this way. It is better now, you can bask in the sun without any sunburn. See you later. Qi-hua, let me take you home. Thanks, I want to go by myself. So more exercise. Qi-hua! How did you drive! Are you all right, Qi-hua? Nothing. By the way, I saw that you have no appetite recently. So I prepared some appetizers for you that I just forgot to give you. Thanks, I'll eat when I get back. Thank you, have a good night. - Okay. - Bye. Bye. This is a new building of our company. Yes, there are more details over there. Well. Dear, I thought you weren't coming, and rushing off on vacation with Qing-wen. How can it be? You invited me, how dare I not coming? That's right. Check it out, how is it? Not bad, it's amazing. So far so good, right? Why didn't Qing-wen come? He is busy with the work, so he can go on vacation with me. You are so happy. Isn't that your ex-boyfriend? It seems like he still didn't give up on you. We broke up a long time ago, he is not my type at all. He's coming today, because he knew the boss of this property. Alright, let's go. Jia-jia. Long time no see, and you're still so beautiful. Here, it's for you. Thank you. Let me introduce. This is my best friend, Qi-hua. Hello... This is Lu Cheng. I still have something to catch on, have a good time. - Excuse me for a moment. - Fine. She is quite an exquisite girl. Then, Mr Lu. Do you also work in the public relations industry? No, I am a computer programmer. Those very nerdy one, so I can't get together with her. I see. Can he do magic? Everyone, a live show for you. Me? Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. First of all, I need a one-dollar-bill. Who can borrow me one? - I can... - Can you? Thanks. Thank you so much. Well, you can see it. Here's a one-dollar-bill. First of all, let's fold this in half. Then fold and fold... You will find that it is changing the color slowly and slowly, and it is now became a ten-dollar-bill. There is more. Do you remember the ten-dollar-bill just now? Watch carefully, it is now a 50-dollar one. Okay. Don't blink, come on. One, two, three. Do you remember the 100-dollar-bill just now? Let's see the magic. One, two, three. Two 50-dollar-bills now. Qi-hua, are you okay? What's wrong? Do you need to see a doctor? What's wrong with her? Is she pregnant? No way! But it seems to be it. But when we arrived... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Safety first. No, I know you like children anyway. But... Say no more. Qi-hua, there's a delivery. - Thank you, Sister Mu. - You are welcome. "Human chorionic gonadotropin test strip" Qi-hua, what's wrong? Qi-hua, what's wrong with you? Qi-hua, calm down. - Why? - Everything will be all right. Qi-hua. "Le Baby" Is that okay? Hello, Qing-wen. I'm back. Look what I bought. "Diapers" Diapers. Milk bottle. Clothes. I don't know whether it's a boy or a girl, so I bought both colors. How's it? Cute, right? Hello, my dear. How did you come? Here you are. You made it yourself? No, I was in a party, and I just stole it there. Don't you know you can't eat watermelon in the pregnancy? Is that so? All right, I'll eat it. Jia-jia. Have you been to Japan? Never. I'd like to visit there. Why do you want to go there? I want to go and see where Qing-wen once lived and the road he walked. Jia-jia. Can you go with me next time when you have the holidays? Of course. Maybe by that time, my belly will be too big for me then. But do you sure that you are really pregnant? You don't believe me? It's not that I don't believe you. But I've always heard Qing-wen saying that he wants to fight for a few years, then raise a child after achieving successes in the career. He changed his mind. Changed? Is that so? Qing-wen. I have good news for you, I am pregnant with our children. It was that day, the day you were going to propose to me. Are you happy? "Human chorionic gonadotropin test strip" Qi-hua. Pregnancy should be no slightest careless, we have to be careful. I saw your pregnancy test in the bathroom. I think... It is better to take another test. Okay, let's test again. I told you there was no problem, check it for yourself. Honey, are you sure that you're not with another guy? What are you talking about? We are good friend, you know me. Sorry... Jia-jia. You say the baby would be more like me or Qing-wen? It's definitely like you. How pretty you are, right? But I would prefer the baby to be like Qing-wen more, as if Qing-wen is there with us... Do you feel that someone is following us? - Where is it? - On our right hand side. Don't look at it, that's crazy. Let's go. Sir, you have shot enough. Hi. Hi, Miss Lin. Hello. It's you? What a coincidence. Yes, quite so. What are you doing sneaking around here? Sneaky? Oh, come on. Please have some respect for art. My job is to find and capture all art. Besides, it has nothing to do with you, I am not shooting you anyway. Nothing with me? So you mean that I am not artistic enough? Is that so? Answer me! Well, enough. Look at you, just act like a child. But he said I was not artistic enough. Let's go, just don't get serious with those artists. I'm telling you that you'd better be careful about these people with unclear heads, we can't be sure what he did. So don't blame me for not reminding you then. Forget it. Today is a rare chance to go out, don't pull a face, okay? But he said I wasn't artistic enough. Smile. Alright, great artist. Sorry for that, and we got to go now. Just go ahead with your creation then. - Bye. - Great artist? Qi-hua. When I go to the headquarter, the station director is very satisfied with your work. It was a gift I bought you from the last time I go travel, I hope that you would like it. Director. Such a valuable gift, I'm afraid I'm can't take it. Qi-hua. We have worked together for so many years, don't stay a stranger. Let me take you home, Qi-hua. No, thank you. Don't drive after you drink. Take a taxi or call a chauffeur. It's okay, I take you back. Let's go then. Director, I have to go now. - Qi-hua. - Bye, see you tomorrow. Let me take you back. Qi-hua? "Taxi" Did you hear about our boss saw a ghost last night? Yeah, it seems that the ghost also said something about... Don't you touch my girl... So scary. Do you think this has something to do with Qi-hua's dead boyfriend? What's going on? Don't you have papers to pick up? - Yes. - Go... "Vice-director's office" Sit down as you please, I have something urgent to do. - No, director... - We will talk about it later, okay? Qi-hua, forget all those nonsense. They're all rumoring about the haunting. There is no ghost, I haven't seen it before. Just leave them alone. Are you tired of shooting today? No, not at all. Have some water... Thanks. Are you okay? - I'm good. - Are you sure? Yeah. You are so beautiful. I got to go. What really happened last night? Wei met a ghost last night. Ghost? Is it that one before? Yes. The ghost also told him too... Don't you touch my girl... How terrible. So he ended up like this. No way, how did it happen? Xiao-yu, what's going on? I don't know. Sister Mu? I don't know either. Aren't you going to buy the water? - Yeah. - Let's go together. We'll be back soon. Wei, I am sorry. No, it's okay. Do you want a towel? Wei. Just take good care of yourself, I'll handle the work. Okay. Go back. I am okay. Hello, Jia-jia. Are you free now? Can you accompany me out for a walk. Sure, I am now... I am waiting for you by the Ben Pool in Xintiandi Shopping Street, okay? Thanks, See you soon. Hello, my dear. How are you? Is everything all right recently? - It's okay. - Let's go then. What's the matter? Why is the bleeding? Doctor, please. Please save my child. Please be sure to keep my kid, it doesn't matter even as if you need to sacrifice me. Don't worry, we will deal with it. Doctor, I am begging you. Hello, nurse. Where is the doctor? The doctor was there. Doctor. What is the situation with my friend just now? Her injury was not serious, just some little flesh wound. But, I suggest it's best for her to have a check-up at psychiatry department. Psychiatry? Why? See, this's her test report, she keeps claiming she's pregnant. But, in the fact that... There is no pregnancy at all, see? She was not pregnant? You're all lying to me. Just calm down, can you? You can't always live in your own world. Qi-hua, listen to me. No, I won't! You also saw that, right? The pregnancy test bar is clearly positive, which means that I am pregnant. Maybe there is something wrong with the pregnancy test bar. Is it... Perhapes my child is dead, so you deliberately kept it from me and lied to me, claiming that I was not pregnant at all. Say something. Speak up! You have to calm down, okay? I beg you to tell me. I am begging you to tell me. I am begging you to tell me! I disappoint Qing-wen. I did not protect our child well enough. Jia-jia? Jia-jia. According to our correspondence. The Industrial and Commercial Departments have recently announced a list of counterfeit products to the public. Includes a batch of pregnancy tests. "Human chorionic gonadotropin test strip" I told you there was no problem, check it for yourself. This batch of pregnancy tests have been widely sold on the internet, many consumers found problems after using it then, and reported to the Industrial and Commercial Department. The Industry and Commerce Department has organized an investigation team to conduct an in-depth investigation now. Jia-jia? Jia-jia. Are you alright? Nothing. Why did you come to see me? Here's the thing. I have a friend who opened a company, and there's a brand that he wanted to promote it. What I mean is that... Can you help them with the public relations job? Of course. Also, Jia-jia. Can we get back... I always know it, you are not here for any public relations matters. Mr Lu, I'll make it clear with you today. No matter how much I lack of a man, I'll not like anyone like you. Look at yourself? Do you think we are a match? Come on, stop your delusions. Hi, it's me. I know that you don't want to see me, but it doesn't matter. I just want to tell you about that. After the last candid photo of yours, based on your charm and your inspiration, I have created a particularly satisfied work. And I really want you to be the first to see it. Am I look... so haggard and ugly now? Why don't you even come to see me? Are you angry with me? Ms Lin, what's up? You look bad these day. Qing-wen, is that you? No way, we have to do something immediately. Qing-wen... Qing-wen, no! Don't be afraid, relax. What are you doing? Not yet... No, there is one last step. Here... Let me help you. Don't go away, come on. - Come on, just one more. - Let me out! - Where can you go? - Let me out! - Do you feel pain? - Yes. There you have it, so sod off! Why are you here? Sorry, I didn't mean to follow you. I wanted to invite you to see my work. But when I got downstairs, I saw you leaving in a daze. I really worried about you, so I followed along all the way. I can't believe... Thank you. That liar, He must have hypnotized you. Hypnosis? Since I got the bone china, It seems to be lots of strange things around me suddenly. There is no supernatural thing in this world, everything is understandable. Well, don't overthink about it. Here, let me show you something interesting. See? I wanted to see you that day, but I ran into Jia-jia at the entrance of the hospital. She was very strange that day, and ignored me when I called her. But her eyes attracted me, so I followed and shot all the way. Jia-jia. Jia-jia? "Outpatient" No, this is not the house that she lives in. I've been to her house, not like that. Who is it? Landlord, it's me. It's you. Something wrong. I would like to renew the lease of this house, and here is the rent. That's all right. - Thank you. - Alright. I followed her to the door of her home. While she didn't close the door, I secretly took a few pictures by the way. That's all. You interrupt the heart that I miss you. Wait. Hello, Jia-jia. Where are you? I want to see you. Honey, I'm on a business trip now. I'll talk to you when I get back. And see you, bye. Hold on. You go to play Jia-jia and ask him for the key. - I can't. - Believe yourself, you can do it. Here, go. Come on. What should I say? Who is it? Sir, I'm from next door. Are you really the neighbor girl? Yes. Is there anything I can help. I left in a hurry this morning, and forgot to take the key. Could you please lend me your spare key for a while? Why are you so careless? Fortunately, I have a spare key here. Wait a second. Are you really the girl next door? Yes. Be careful later. - Give it back after using it. - Sure. Thank you. This house is so strange with two different decoration styles. Is Jia-jia having schizophrenia? Okay, wait a minute. Who's that man with Jia-jia? He is my fiance. One is my loved man, one is my best best friend. Don't think anything, take a good rest first. I'll make you a cup of coffee. Feng. Feng? Feng. Are you making coffee? Feng. I fear that you will get out of control. Also... I also don't know that when I face you, if I still have the courage to speak up. Before I propose to you, I have to confess one thing to you. In fact, I also met Jia-jia while I knew you. Then she volunteered to pursue me. If you love me, stay with me. But, Qi-hua... Just tell her that the company sent you on a business trip. I... Then you should go back to her. But where should I say? Make it Japan then. Then, she keep pursuing me. We... Are you wearing that torn pants again today? I've told you so many times, don't wear it like this. In case, you would catch a cold. The landlord came back. If you caught a cold, I feel bad that I can take care of you then. Well, here... What are you doing? You are living with me, yet flirting with her everyday. Do you think this is appropriate? You are right. You're so masterfully, and we're just not a good match. Qing-wen. Although I am dominant, I have never forced you. I really love you. Even if I get your person, but I can't get your heart. That make me feel like just some kind of those toys. If you love me too, may you please make your decision as soon as possible? Okay? Sorry. I really love you. And I'm pretty sure that you are the one I want to get married to, but not someone else. I swear. From now on, I will cut off all contact with Jia-jia. Believe me, okay? See? I even have a proposal ring ready. Do you like it? Qi-hua, can I get your forgiveness for my apology? Will you forgive me? Will you marry me? Surprise, Qi-hua? You missed him for three months, and considering he's the same. Unexpectedly, your beloved one is living with your bestie all the time. It's very hard to accept it emotionally, right? In fact, I feel the same way as you. I want to get close to her so much... Is that your ex-boyfriend? It seems like he still didn't give up on you. But what about her? In her eyes, I am just a dirty monster! Jia-jia, I just want to be a heterosexual best friend with you. Even such a simple requirement, won't you agree? Instead, to the one here who took away all you love, you have never thought of abandon her. In fact, you even want to kill her. Isn't that right? Don't you guys curious about it? Why is that... I would know all about it? Thanks to your Jia-jia, have all your thoughts all recorded in the computer, those private documentation. Have you forgotten the job of mine? That's computer security. I deal with the computer every day, so I naturally understand all the technology of the hackers. What is more, I'm a guy who loves gossip. To tell you the truth, In your phone or even computer... What you have recorded about your life, I know them all. Sometimes I think about it naively. I can finally be your bestie then. Therefore, you, her and Qing-wen, your complex triangles is just like those TV shows, I watch every day. Somehow, this drama... The more I watch, the more I hate you. And this video I am going to show you, I am sure that you will definitely love it. Qi-hua, sorry. Jia-jia has something to tell you. Qi-hua. I want to go to the sauna, so you may take a nap after the shower. Why are you here? We are good bestie, so I choose to quit. I wish you happiness. How about it? My lady. The plot is touching, right? Later, there is a more exciting ending. To see your common lover... the very last time. I know I did wrong, will you forgive me? See you at the restaurant later. - Who are you? - Hello. Jia-jia. What you are bent on doing but are afraid it, I have done it for you. Because, not only being your best friend, I'm also the dark side of your heart. I am the another Jia-jia of the dark. Lu Cheng, you are crazy! Do you think you were helping me? You're hurting me. Am I hurting you? Didn't you hurt her too? Qi-hua, I'm telling you. Do you think that your very precious vase is really make out of Qing-wen's ashes? She have it changed for you at the very beginning, The one you used to make that bone china is just the ashes of her former beloved dog. This is your cherished ashes. Very well... This TV series will soon becoming a reality show. Jia-jia. I trust you so much, how can you... Sorry... I really love Qing-wen too much. When he was alive, I can not get him. But after his death, I just wanted to have him with all my strength. Sorry... Wait. Can I interject a little secret? According to what I see, words have been written in Jia-jia's diary like this. When he is alive, he is all yours. Do you still want to monopolize him when he is dead? I hate it! I'm so stupid. For a fake ashes, I have done so many meaningless things. Since you hate me so much, why don't you just kill me? Do you think that she doesn't want to kill you? She just doesn't want to act. That's why, it's my turn to be the dark side of her. Qi-hua... But then, if you didn't claim that you were pregnant, you've long been dead. Don't you touch my girl! Because I hurt them, do you think that I'm protecting you? I am just protecting my dear Jia-jia and her broken heart. Also, to prevent those stinky men from defiling the child of the man you love. This is what a best friend should be done for each other. Unexpectedly, you lied to her instead! You pretend to be pregnant! I'll kill you. Don't! Lu Cheng, I know it. You are my best friend. It was all my fault before, can you forgive me? Jia-jia. You are finally willing to accept me now? It's really worthwhile, of I have done for you. Jia-jia. Alright... Untie me first, so that I can give you a good hug. Isn't it? No, I killed someone. And now she knew it, I won't escape the legal sanctions for sure. What is more, you accepted me now... How about this? Let me kill her now, then we will flee away together. What do you think? No! No, I am begging you. She is my best friend, let her go. She is your bestie, but what about me? Who am I to you? As long as she is there, I can't predominate in your heart. No. I must kill her. Jia-jia! Jia-jia! Are you okay? Jia-jia! Jia-jia. Jia-jia. Hang on, I'll call an ambulance. It's no use. He didn't choose me, but... I can be with him finally. I... I'm sorry... Jia-jia, no... Jia-jia? Jia-jia! Don't leave me, Jia-jia! Feng. Which one is Qing-wen? Which is Jia-jia? Guess? I guess... This one on right look like a boy, while the left one looks like a girl. So I suppose that the left one is Jia-jia. You tell it apart by shape? They can't talk, I can only guess so. Come on. Did you hear something? I hear they say... Don't trust a man named Feng. Yeah, they're right, because I'm a madman. Only a madman can make such a perfect work. I think they will be satisfied. Thank you. No, I should express my thanks instead. Qing-wen, right. Although I made you into the shape of a woman, but's a beautiful choice, so please don't mind it. By the way, I don't know you, but I want to thank you too. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have met such a nice girl like Qi-hua. Don't worry, I will take good care of her. Qing-wen, Jia-jia. Perhaps you two are really the right one for each other. I hope you are happy in the heaven, and beloved with each other in the afterlife. Let's go. After this experience, I thought I could use this technology of making bone china to help those who have lost their loved ones, so they can always be accompanied. Maybe it can alleviate the increasingly expensive and the short of cemeteries too. I can found a company specialized in promoting bone china. - Well, let's work together. - Sure.
