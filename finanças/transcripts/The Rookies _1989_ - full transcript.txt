Oh, Diane, club sandwich to go. Come on, Carl. I'm just trying to have a conversation, here. Lighten up. Yeah, well some of us haveto work for a living, hot dog. Hey, Diane. What do you say we go celebrate? Just you and me, maybe go down to the anchor or something like that. How about that coffee, Diane,if it's not too inconvenient. Here. I'm counting to ten, Diane. Your dad called. He was climbing the walls. Yeah, I bet. It worked out pretty good for me. He took me in the third round. I know. It's all over the school paper. So, why didn't you call, creep? I don't know. I stayed on an extra fewdays to get some training. You going to come see me play? CARL: 10,000, Diane. Listen. I'm real proud of you, Corey, you deserve it. Let's get out of here. I can't. Come on. I can't. OK, fine. I'm going to do it myself. I got to go, OK? See you later. Hey, Dyson. You do good, we'll name a sandwich after you. The Dyson Club, double ham. You're funny. ANNOUNCER: Hey,congratulations to Cathy. Congratulations, guy. ANNOUNCER: She's our big winner of our great [inaudible] giveaway contestwho takes home a new KOD mug, and a-- Did you hear Wanda Reagers is pregnant? Hear her talking with Carol at the Three Star. She's thinking of keeping it. Really? Of course, Darrel's freak. Oh, he asked about you. COREY: Yeah? Probably just wants to talk. Anyways. Carol's applying for thiscourse out in Edmonton. You know, hotel managementand hospitality. I was thinking of going with her. - You serious? - Well, yeah. I mean, if I can get thetuition together and stuff. Carol says they place 50 graduates every year. When did you decide this? What do you want me to do Corey, stop my life? No, I'm not asking you to do that. What do you want? I want what I've always wanted. I want to be a hockey player, Diane. I want to be the best. I meant about us. I'm not going to evaporate, Diane. Are you going to come see me play on weekends? This is what I've always worked for, Diane. This is it. I know. It's just that I can't hang around, Corey. Wondering where you are and what you're doing. I don't want to think about you all the time. [music - blue rodeo, "try"] Every time you walk in the room. I couldn't ever be sure of a smile. Fine. I'm falling in love. Oh, night after night. Oh, it's crazy. I should go. Oh, you've got to try. Try. Try. Bye. Try. Try. It's going to be quiet around here. Listen, dad. You sure you don't want me to stick around, help out with winter? I'll manage. You better get going. Oh. Oh, no dad. Come on. Come on, son, it'll come in handy. All right. Well, better wish me luck. Luck's got nothing to do with it. You keep your head up, and you'll do just fine. Your mom would have been proud, son. Go on, now. Thanks. Take care of yourself. Yeah. [music playing] [cheers] Run, Pat. It's always a pleasure to havemy good friend, Phil Rankon, here with me in the booth on locker talk. How are you, Phil? Nice to see you home. Oh, it's good to be home, Harry. Phil, I know you've been backand forth, and hither and yon, but I'll bet you're looking forward to another fine Blade season. Now, let's talk about the rookies. Look, there's got to be some mistake. I play center. Take it up with Coach Brennan,I'm just doing forms today. Molly, get Tricker. He forgot to get his billing. What? Nothing. RECEPTIONIST: Next. Come on, you guys. Pick up the pace. You've got to be on the ice in a half an hour. Phil, confirm or deny. What I'm hearing is 2% atthe gate, $15,000 in cash, and a first round draft pick in '91. I mean, is Glen Moyerthat hot or did Sue Saint Marie get the better deal? Hank, think the real point here is that we're very lucky to have young Moyer here with us in Oshawa. I think the fans deserve it. In the August issue of "Hockey Update", it was reported that yourbrother got 3.5 million over three seasons with the LA King deal. Did he ever talk to you about that? No, not really. That's none of my business. Do you think Kevin willcome up and see you play? Well, we're both very busy. So, if you'll excuse me. Glen. Glen, just one more question. Are you gunning for your brother's junior record? No comment. Phil, what about Pat Hebler? Made his debut in Detroit,popular favorite with the fans, they called him The Pocket down there. Obviously, a reference tothe great Henri Richard, another diminutive hockey player who went on to achieve all-star status. I know Pat's probably disappointed. He fizzled in the playoffs in Detroit, and now he's back with the Blades. But obviously, it's only a matter of time before Pat goes back up to the NHL. My question to you is this,can Glen Moyer fill his skates? Well, Harry. Obviously, we've got tobe looking to the future. But in the meantime, as long as Pat is with us, he's our first line star. DONNY: Hey, Pat. What are you doing here, man? Chuck said you signed with Detroit. Hey, Donny. DONNY: What happened? Did you miss me? Eat this. Nice shot, dipstick. Don't you ever get tiredof being humiliated, Donny? Watch my dust, man. I'm making it this year. All right. Now, listen up, you guys. You can pick up your colors over at the bin, and let's keep off the iceuntil notified otherwise. Let's get out there and play some hockey. Hey, Chucker. Got a six-pack you want to throw me? Cuffrey what are you doing? Get this thing out of here.- What thing? What thing? This fridge. Cuffrey, I'm serious. Get it out of here. Get it out of here. Dibbs, give Humphrey a hand. Chuck, I was counting on two spaces this year. I've got a lot of gear. Dibbs. Cuffrey, don't leave that there.Dibbs. Chuck! Hey. What's happening? Yeah, how you doing? Donny, good to see you again. That's good. OK. Listen, I'm serious. You got about 3 and 1/2minutes to get out on the ice. So, let's stop diddling the dog. PLAYER: Chuck, my two lockers. No, take the locker that I gave you. Hey. Got some tape? What? - Tape. - Yeah, Yeah. Tape, here. Thanks, man. PLAYER: Hey. Good luck, rookie. Gentlemen. Stand up please. Take a look at yourselves. 49 of the best amateur rankedhockey players in the country. Now, let's talk about the odds. First row, sit down please. In 10 days, 24 of you will still be here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Sit down please. No, not you. Now, that's how many of youwill sign NHL contracts. One, two, three. Rest you guys, sit down. Only three of you will ever set a skate in a Major League hockey rink. Two of you guys, sit down. Mr. Decento. Only one of you will last more than two seasons of professional hockey. Whoo! PLAYER: Yeah, all right. Sit down. Sit down. All right. Welcome to training camp. Pat look, I didn't expect to see you back. How you feeling? Good. I feel good. Had a bit of a slump. Got it worked out though. That's great. Listen, I thought maybe you could help me out for a couple of days. I just want to sit back and watch it, you know. Especially, with the rookies. Work with them, OK? - Sure. Tricker, Kelvert,Tyson, Mr. Decento, Moyer. Which one of you guys is Moyer? As in Kevin Moyer? Yeah. Yeah, he's my brother. Are you as good as he is? I guess we'll have to see about that. I guess. Looks like we got the A-team here guys. All right, power laps. Let's go. Move it. 20 minutes. Hey. I was watching you today. You got a pretty good stunt shot. Yeah? Yeah. Thanks. Who are you? Dyson. Corey Dyson. [music playing] OLD MAN: Yeah, it's bingo night in Canada. And Mrs. Cram is out losingthe pension check again. She won a toaster once. Keeps her coming back. Damn thing hasn't worked since day one. Mrs. Cram and I have been takingin the players for 15 years. It used to be good companyfor her until I retired. Oh, we enjoy it. It's a community thing. You got to pitch in once in awhile. You know what Bob Craig's worth, Corey? No sir. Bobby stayed with us for over two years. He's out playing with the Canucks this season. Vancouver. Mrs. Cram can't wait for the season to start so we can watch him on the TV. So, you're a White Vale boy, are you? Yes sir. That a hockey community? Well, we share a rinkwith a couple other teams. This futon was Bobby's. We had a pull out bed, but Bobbyliked to sleep on the floor. Can you beat that? No sir. OLD MAN: Whatever turns you on, I guess. Were you a draft pick or just a walk on? Actually, I was selectedin the third round. OLD MAN: That right? Bobby was drafted first, overall. Oh. He used to draw the crowds. We had standing room onlyfor the weekend games. Yeah, but that's enough said about that. What about yourself, Corey? Well, I play center. I had a record for assists lastyear and 94 points in season. Guess that's about it. Uh huh. Well, there's extra blankets in the toilet there, if you need them, andsome meat loaf in the oven. You just help yourself. [music playing] I thought Saint Louis wasready to sign 10 days ago. Listen Pat, all I can do is advise. But this bonus incentive nonsense is bogus. They get you for nothing,they treat you like nothing. What about Detroit? Still a chance there? I don't think we can count on Detroit. They've got their eye onthis kid from Chicoutimi. Now what? So, what do we do? Well, you relax and play hockey. I'll go down to Saint Louis, tie things up, and bring you backsomething you can live with. OK? Yeah. Hi. Hi. How's it going? All right. How you doing? Good, good. Good. So, I heard you were playing down in Detroit. You did, did you? How'd you like it down there? It was all right. CHUCK: Get your tights on, girls. Get ready to dance. OK. Let's everybody on the ice in 10 minutes. You got something to tell me? What? What? Your agent's upstairs. Oh yeah, that. CHUCK: Good luck. Could be any day. Let's go, ladies. 9 minutes, we got. 9 minutes, I want everybody on the ice. All right. Watch the angle now, watch the angle. There you go. Square up your shoulders next time. Moyer. All right, little brother. Come on. Come on, little brother. CHUCK: Nice try, Moyer. What's the matter, little brother? You want another turn? Moyer, you want another turn or what? I'll tell you what. I'll ask these guys if it's all right, OK? You guys mind if Moyer has another turn? Mr. Decento. Woohoo. Nice move, Donny. What? What? That was absolutely brutal, Donny. Why don't you show us howthey do it in the NHL, Pat? You mouth off one more time to DeSanto, I'm going to rip your ugly little face off. You keep your scummy hands off me, Hebler. Dyson. Let's go, Dyson. Again. Oh yeah. Beautiful. Star drill. 20 minutes. Moyer, let's go. [music playing] Dyson. Come here. You been training? Yeah. Who's been coaching you? Different people. My dad. CHUCK: I be in the market for a winger. Yeah. Well, I play center. You do, huh? Hebler, man. Thinks he's some kind of hot shot because he signed with the Wings for 25,000. He only played with them for six weeks. You live around here, Donny? Yeah. Couple miles. Across from the plant. Your dad work at the plant? He used to. Got laid off last winter. Same day, they canned 3,000 guys. Hey, Donny. Yo. What do you know about coach Brennan? DONNY: Nothing. Apparently, could've coached NHL. Montreal wanted him, so did Boston, but he decided to stay here. You figure it out. Shouldn't have missed that shot today. DONNY: But what do you care? Not going to cut Kevin Moyer's brother. Hey, Donny. Yo. What do you guys do for fun around here? Fun? Fun can be arranged. Stick with Donny. [music playing] DONNY: Trust me. [inaudible] Some of them come all the way from Kingston justlooking for one thing, you know? Pat's got it made, man. Especially if you're on the first line. Dibbs, Cuffrey, and Hebler,they get all the ice time. You should've seen last yearwhen Craigswood was here. First line, got 367 points regular season. The whole rest of the team only got 120. You're in the first line, it don't matter. You could look like nothing. You walk in here and you whistle. That one you can forget about. She's strictly first line. No ifs, ands, or buts. Yeah? Who is she? Owner's daughter. Do I have to spell it out for you? Major attitude. Besides, she's a slummer. Donny, tell me something. Do you got a girlfriend? Me? No. Saps your energy. Discipline, sacrifice, I'mputting the team first. Believe me when I tell you my friends. You want to make it, you've got to fight off those kind of animal urges. Tell you one thing. More than a few have fallen by the wayside. You know, some women just don't understand the life of an athlete. What about you, Glen? You got a girlfriend back home? Yeah, yeah. She's first year [inaudible],, pre-med. I get to meet up with her over Christmas and her folks got to aplace in The Keys, you know. DONNY: Sounds like Moyer's headed down for a trip to the Not like Dyson. Dyson's got a dozen groupies want to hang off his eyelashes and yodel. [yodels] Is that right, Donny? Is that right? Am I talking about what I'm talking about? Hey. Maybe Corey doesn't want totalk about his personal life, all right? Yeah? Well, maybe you should askhim if he wants to talk about his personal life. Corey? [music playing] DONNY: We've got to be upat the crack of dawn, guys. We got practice. Yeah. All right, gentlemen. This will be an elimination exercise. Each team will have atleast one period of play. The winners of the first round will face off against each other. We will observe the rulesof sudden death overtime. Any questions? Good. All right. Green and black team's up first. Let's go. Tricker, Stakowski, play back. Moyer, take center. Let's go. [whistle blows] Get it back, get it back. 17, that's Moyer. Ah. Dyson.

Come on, hustle. Come on. Eat that, Hebler. Yeah! TEAMMATE: Come on, Donny, get up. [whistle blows] PLAYER: Way to go. Thanks. Hey, DeSanto. Go back to the plant, get yourself a real job. Hey. Donny, Donny. You played great out there. You popped that guy. What are you, blind? What? I played like garbage out there. You don't say that again. Ever. I blew it, pop. That was my shot. I blew it.

No. Go ahead, go ahead. Do you miss home? Is that it? That's the question? Yeah. No. Why? I mean, sometimes. I guess. Oh. I would've thought you know,like being away from home, and living alone, thepressures of school and hockey, having to perform, and those lonesome bus rides through the night. Now, I would imagine thatwould be very difficult. You know, a painful experience almost. What? Well, no. No, it's not like that for me at all. I like playing for the Blades. You know, the facilitiesare good, the staff's great. I like Oshawa a lot. Happy. Thank you. Oh, no problem. Thank you. [music playing] [SINGING] The bells of [inaudible] ring out in my heart. Hi. Hi.

Kalvert, Moyer. Come on, let me take center. Go. No, no. It's number 17. That's Corey Dyson. [cheers] ANNOUNCER: Dyson. Looks like number 17, Corey Dyson. ANNOUNCER: They've been hiding number 17. Hi. Hi. BRENNAN: Sit down. That was quite a display you put on out there. Yeah. Well, I could play better, if you just give me a little more ice time. You know, let me play first line. Listen. You play when I say, where I say. You sit on the bench for halfa season if I tell you to. That's why they call me the coach. Right. Is that it? No. No, that's not it. Listen, let me ask you something. What are you doing dogging behind the net with two open wingers? I scored the goal, didn't I? I thought that's what I was here for. You got lucky. They'll nail you next time. Nobody is making the plays. If I pass it to Kalvert orMoyer, it's just a wasted shot. Oh. Oh, now I see. Now, I get it. Listen, you better stuff thatattitude back in your pocket because let me tell you something, pal. You don't straighten up, I'll send you right back where you came from. I don't care how good you are.

But if everything goes right, the 14th. Isn't that the Windsor game? Yeah. I want them to see you up against the best. Moyer, you got some tape? Check my bag. Listen, I was thinking. If we play back in our zone, Iknow Tricker's not the fastest skater, but he could pass. We use your speed, wemight get a jump on things. Right, yeah. So, when's yourgirlfriend coming anyways? I'd like to meet her. Wouldn't count on it. What's going on? I got traded. You're kidding. Caught the swift currentfirst thing in the morning. Whoa, man. Look, that's-- don't worry about it.

Alex told me about you. So, how's it going up here? Not bad, thanks. Bobby just came in from Vancouver. What a surprise. Well, I've got to catch up with a team in New York on Saturday, if Ican get a flight out of here. Listen, a few of us aredriving down to Toronto later. Maybe you'd like to come along. I don't think so. Nice to meet you. Corey. What's your problem? Why don't you go to Toronto,and have yourself a good time? Corey, he's a friend. This has nothing to do with you and me. Look, if it'll make you feel any better, he doesn't mean anything to me anymore. Yeah. Right. [music playing] [cheers] [music playing] I have to say, and I know the fans feel it, the Blades have been something less than scintillating this year. Lackluster would be a better word. ANNOUNCER: Come on down and meet a-- Hebler, what's going on up there? I know. I know. A dozen scoring, chancesmissed, nobody's in position. We'll get it back. We'll get it back. Dyson. Take Moyer's, line. Play center. [whistle blows] And Sudbury takes a three-goal lead. [booing] Nice try, Bobby. ANNOUNCER: Sudbury goal scored by number 9.

Great. Look, it's not me, man. What about Hebler? Don't you worry about Hebler. He knows better. He's got discipline. He respects the game. He puts the team first, something you wouldn't understand. Let me tell you something. Six years as an assistant. 11 years as head coach. I have never seen aplayer with your ability. I'm talking about pure instinct for the game. It's a gift. And these players come downhere, last a couple of seasons. Good players. Most of them know this is the end of the line. And they'd do anythingto have half your talent. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? [knocks] Uh-huh? Is Pat here? Pat? PAT: Yeah? There's somebody here to see you. PAT: All right. That's all right, Gale. You can go ahead now. How you doing? OK. Look, about today. I don't know what happened, I, you know, I guess I kind of lost it. So, I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, I probably shouldn'thave said what I said either. Pat? Why don't you ask your friendto come in, offer him a beer? The thing is that theydeal Moyer off today, right? Tomorrow it could be me. It could be you. It could be Dibbs. Dibbs maybe, but not you. Yeah, well. Listen, I heard about whathappened to you today. I appreciate the fact thatyou'd come by to apologize. Yeah. Well, thanks. It was a nice thing to do. Yeah. OK, well, take care. Hey, Dyson. Despite the fact that youcan be a real pain sometimes, you're a pretty good hockey player. Thanks. Good night, man. [music playing] Dinner time. [bell rings] Morning, Carl. CARL: Hey, Diane. So, two weeks and counting. Are you going to miss me? CARL: Nah. Hi. Corey. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. So, what's going on? Nothing. Can I get some coffee or juice or something? Yeah. Sure. What did you do to your hair? Nothing. It's just a body wave, you know. Dries faster. Looks good. Tried to call you a couple of times. Couldn't get through. Thanks. So, does your dad know you're in town? No. He thinks I'm in Peterborough. There's a game there tonight. What's going on, Corey? Nothing. I don't know. Everything, I guess. I got suspended. [bell rings] Can you get off? Can we go someplace and talk? Yeah, sure. Carl, I'll be back in a few minutes. OK? PAT: All right. [bell rings] Damn pipes never worked in this place. The ice is always too soft,or too hard, or too something. Jesus, Diane. I can't go home. I can't let my old man see me like this. I mean, 14 years, fivedays a week, my old man's up at the crack of dawn. He's got the truck running,he's got the gear in there. He's down here watching the drills. Remember that time he hurt his back? Yeah. Fraley brought him down here in a wheelchair. They hauled him up the ramp and-- He never missed a game. Not one. Anyways, listen. I'd better get going. You got to get back to work. What do you want, Corey? No. I can't. I promised myself. Dammit, Corey. You know, you can't just breeze into town every time you feel likeit and expect to pick it up where it left off. Nothing's changed. Everything's the same. You just can't keep doing this to me. It's not fair. I know. So, when you heading off, anyways? Oh, a couple of weeks. My parents, they're helpingme with the tuition. I got to sublet out in Edmonton. So, you and Carolyn going to party down? Actually, Carol decided not to go. Didn't want to leave Terry or something. Well, I don't know, it'll be good. It'll be good for you. You get to hang out with thesmart crowd for a change. So, what are you going to do, Corey? I don't know. I think I might head up north. I hear they've got someopenings up at the plant. Or, you know, stay here. Go back to the farm. You feel sorry for yourself. Something wrong with that? You only got one thing onyour mind, and you know it. So, you better go back there and finish this thing up once and for all. Because I didn't spend everyFriday night in this old rink for five years in goalie pads so you could take practice shots for nothing. I thought you liked doing that. Oh, you did, huh? Maybe I just liked watching you. I mean, you were so free. Excited. I don't know, maybe I was just jealous. I sure blew it with you, didn't I? You know something? I was at all those games, too. You always were the star, baby. No matter what. You don't know how to be anything else. Go back and finish it up, Corey. Go back and finish it up. [music playing] Alan. Bill.
