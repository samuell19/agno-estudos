BEIJING RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF HUMAN SPECIAL POWER -Tai Kwan, you're back? -Tai Kwan, you're back? Fellow juniors, why don't you use your powers together? We did it together 15 minutes ago, then a strange man showed up. What is it? Stop him! Don't let him go! Stop moving! Who are you? Why did you take me here? What's your intention? -Speak! -Catch him! He claimed to be Eunuch Ngai of the Ming Dynasty. -Your Majesty? -Servant! Why didn't you get on your knees when you saw me? Your Majesty, I apologize! -Hold him. -Hold him. Is he really from the Ming Dynasty? I heard you were defeated by the Saint of Gamblers in Hong Kong. That's why I came back. Is he that great? I think I might need help from the four of you to get my revenge. He's the disciple of the God of Gamblers. He might be of help. Don't worry. I have found a group that will get rid of those who get in our way. The five of us will concentrate on taking down the Saint of Gamblers! -We'll help to kill the Saint of Gamblers! -We'll help to kill the Saint of Gamblers! -What do you want? -Are you done? Hurry up, we're waiting for you! -Close the door first. -What is it? I'll be ready soon. It's tight. I have told you several times not to eat these. You're now the Saint of Gamblers. Can't I hide and eat in the washroom? Jeez. Keep a cigar in your mouth. It spells notability. Let's go. Miss, where did you take your cigar? -From my dad. -Please give way. Dear reporters and fellow relatives, allow me to introduce someone to you. This invisible, unbeatable, and wonderful partner of mine. The disciple of the God of Gamblers, the Saint of Gamblers! -Wonderful! -Congratulations! This is not the way to give a speech. This is what I learned from my mentor. Great guys maintain a low profile when giving out speeches. Ladies and gentlemen, I, the Saint of Gamblers, am extremely honored to meet you. Thank you. -Amazing! -It's wonderful! Besides having daily breakfasts with my mentor, I am currently learning the art of the unbeatable from him. The most skillful part to the art of winning. I can beat all opponents. In fact, I can even beat all competitors. -Then show us your skills. -Sure, but I need an opponent first. -I can be one. -Great. -Shuffle the cards and watch this. -Come on. What's wrong? Here! -Your stomach is not well. -My stomach... -Here! -Don't do that! Something is wrong. -Which one? -Your organ. -You scared me. -Here! There's an extra one. -That's great! -It's a gallstone, how is that fine? Hey, what is this nonsense? Didn't you learn the art of gambling from your mentor? This is one of the greatest art of the God of Gamblers. The art of massage on the sole. My mentor has given up all of his leisure time and taught me this skill, so that I can help others. What a great man he is. This is an invaluable picture. Please feel free to take photos. -The art of massage on the sole? -What? Come on. You were gone for six months. -Didn't you learn anything about gambling? -That's right. -Gambling? Of course. -There is! I threw away trash in the backyard of the God of Gamblers every night. -What is this? -This is bullshit! -Hey! -What? -I'm hungry. -All right. Hey, where's your shark fin soup? Are you hoping to eat shark fin soup? There's no need since you only know the invaluable skill of foot massage. Eat instant noodles instead! Can't I have some luncheon meat? Uncle, is it my birthday? No. What a big piece of luncheon meat this time. It's to celebrate our reunion. It takes me five meals to finish this. Is it too big? -It doesn't matter. -Mr. Ding will give a speech. -Don't eat too fast. -All right. I, Ding Lik, am very glad to meet you in Shanghai. -Is this The Bund? -I believe that everyone is aware... Is Shanghai a beach? -I guess so. -I, Ding Lik, -as a Chinese... -Hey. I like this name, Ding Lik. Who came up with it? There was a real person named Ding Lik back then. He's a great friend of your grandpa. They started a business together. -To fight against... -Really? Yes. What's my grandpa's name? Chow Tai-fook. -Really? -Yes. You should have said that earlier. Do I have a share in the Chow Tai-fook Jewelry Co? These two Chow Tai-fooks are not the same. Your grandpa and Ding Lik sold buns together in Shanghai. -As if. -It's true! Why did they sell buns instead of jewelry? That's right. He was so stupid. He must be ugly. You're wrong! He was very handsome. -Really? -Yes, just look at this picture. This is your grandpa, Chow Tai-fook while this is your grandma, Ng Chun-tin. They're so good looking, just like me. You look exactly the same. -That's right! -Damn! You'll look like this when you're old. -I don't believe it. -Neither did I! What? Are you looking at porn magazines? Your ass. -What? -My mentor told me about him. The French God of Gamblers. A famous guy in Shanghai then. He was unbeatable. Was he that great? He gambled well and he had a special power. -Did he never lose? -Not really. In this book, it says that... he was beaten once by a mysterious guy, called Comment Allez-vous. What a strange name, I wonder if it's true. Hello? Lung Ng? Are you back in Hong Kong? The mentor has something for me? All right, I'll wait for you. This is our ancestral house. Your grandpa passed it to me, then I'll pass it on to you. It bears a history of over 100 years. It has been through ups and downs, but it is still standing strong. Like me. You can't make it stand. Nonsense. What? I have a feeling... that we'll have a strange experience tonight. Something incredible will happen. What is it? I have no idea. -Should I include you? -What do you think? -Of course. -That's smart of you. -What a wonderful world. -What is it? -I heard that grandpa was shy. -That's right. Why are you so shameless? What? That's who I am. What the hell can you do? Nothing, I admire you. Frankly, grandpa was so effeminate. But he was able to court my grandma. A son of a bitch united them. Son of a bitch? Hey. What can you see? Nothing. How about you? Me neither. -Can you go inside... -Take a can... -Do you have to do that? -Do you have to do that? There are five of them. Can you even take all of them? Let's do this together. As expected, something incredible will happen! Damn it! Here I come! Don't act like that. You'll scare them away. It was just an illusion, let's go! Are you okay? You're always like this. Abracadabra. Moving objects in the air, that's amazing. Attack! Why do you have to force me? Why? Why? Hold him tight! I am! The punch of the Saint of Gamblers! Are you all right? Will your mouth foam from my punch? Your mouth is foaming! -Me? -Yes! -It's just saliva. -Saliva? Why don't you say it's urine? A young man, started foaming after being electrocuted. I'm old, but I'm still fine even after taking a punch. -You previously threw up. -That was before. I won't vomit now. At most, I'll just fall down. -Can you do it? -Are you underestimating me? I'll show you. Something's burning? It's me! It's burning! Water! Your Majesty. This eunuch has a beard, his castration must be incomplete. -Servants. -Yes! Go and castrate him again! -What? -Yes! No, Your Majesty! Don't castrate me, Your Majesty! Don't castrate me! No! No, don't castrate me! No! Don't castrate me! Hit the point! I've been castrated! Give it back to me! -Uncle Tat. -Lung Ng. -Where's Sing? -He was with me just now, but somebody hit me and I fainted. Why are you looking for him? The God of Gamblers wants me to pass the phone to him. -He'll call if something urgent comes up. -I see. What do we do now? -Split up and look for him. -All right. Chow Sing-cho! I know it's you, single-eyed guy. You insulted me on the gambling ship. I'm taking my revenge now! There's no end to revenge. Besides, I don't mind if you could get your revenge, but I'm afraid that you'll lose again. If you're more powerful than me, it's me who is taking revenge, not you. Shoot. Five of us will use our power together. You'll be torn into pieces! Sing! Don't come here! Hey, your mentor is looking for you. Go away! I'll just tell him that you're busy! Something is pulling me away! Uncle Tat's phone? -Hello! -What happened just now? It's a long story. Where are you? In the police headquarters. -Commissioner Wong scheduled a meeting. -Hang up already. To deal with the robbers with powerful arms. How about you? Where are you? I have no idea. Probably The New Territories. -I have a meeting. -Give it to me. Give it to me! Hello, Lung Ng? Who is interrupting? It's me! Who are you? I'm Chow Sing-cho, the Saint of Gamblers! Who are you? I'm Commissioner Wong, nicknamed Fatal Scissors Leg. -What leg? -Fatal Scissors Leg! It will jump in the air and blast open your head. Give it to me. -Be wise or I'll blast his head. -Hello? Lung Ng, your friend is so arrogant! Ignore him. Sing, are you all right? I'm fine. Are you in the police headquarters? I'll take a taxi and head over to you. All right, it's a deal. Tell him to be wise or I'll blast his head. Come in! Commissioner, were you using the phone? Am I not allowed to use it? All the other phones broke down while you were using it. That issue is concerning the telephone company! Are you nuts? Excuse me. What is this place? I mean no harm. I'm just wondering how to get to the main road for a taxi. Miss! Uncle Tat! What are you doing up there? Hey, are you crazy? Are you hanging yourself? What are you doing? What are you saying? What are you doing? What are you doing? Let's go down first. Why did you lie on top of me? It felt awful. You're so effeminate, even wearing such strange clothes. Have you lost your mind because of Tai Kwan's power? I don't know what you're talking about. You interrupted me from committing suicide. Why do you want to kill yourself? I'm out of love for the 37th time. You always are. It's nothing to be out of love for 37 times in one's lifetime. It's a total of 37 times in a week. You should die, then. I'll help you get up there. I no longer want to die. You must be crazy, stop joking around. -Tell me. What is this place? -Don't touch me. What has happened, Uncle Tat? Why do you keep calling me uncle? I'm still young. My name is Chow Tai-fook. What do you work as? I sell Shanghai buns. DON'T SPIT HERE SHANGHAI CITY HALL What? What does this board mean? No spitting around. What does "Shanghai City Hall" mean? This is Shanghai. -Is this place Shanghai? -Yes. The Shanghai where Hui Man-keung -and Ding Lik existed? -Yes. However, Hui Man-keung was shot dead last night. Are you talking about yesterday's episode? No, it's in the news. Look. "Hui Man-keung was killed with 46 gunshots"? "July 1937"? Is it July 1937 today? Yes, it's the year of the Cow. Uncle Tat! -Who are you calling for? -Why didn't you tremble? Why should I? Are you really my grandpa? Grandpa? Do you want to be my grandson? What's your name? -What is it? -Son of a bitch. Mr. Ham! What's wrong? Damn it. So what I heard is true? What did you hear? The highest level of special power will change time and space. The person who uses special power will travel back and forth in time. What are you talking about? -The phone. -What's a "phone"? What is this? It looks interesting. -The line is busy. -What is that? I can't believe this. I have to figure this out! Hey! Grandson! Hey, Grandson. Grandson. What is it? This is considered a lifetime of representative work. How am I supposed to believe this? Why not? I'm still a virgin and I believe you when you said that you're my grandson. Is the police here? I have no idea. It has nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with me. Over there! -In red? -In red? Are you going to beat me up because I'm wearing red? Yes, to avenge Keung. Attack him! -Hey. -What is it? I'm not wearing anything red, so I don't have to run. I don't have to run either. -Why? -It's because I'm a good fighter. -Really? -Yes. Is that so? That's great. Your grandson is a great fighter. -Really? -Yes! That's amazing! I can beat up to nine people at a time and I am invulnerable! -So amazing! -That's right! Why don't you sit down over there? Have a sugar cane and watch me. All right. -Okay? -What "K"? -Wonderful! -Yes! Wonderful! -Hey! -What? Prepare for the funeral. Fall to your feet. What are you waiting for? Go to the hospital at once and stop fighting! Hey, it will do you no good. Grandson, are you done? Not yet, just sit back. There are many guys in black. Take care of them. -My punches doesn't hurt today. -Really? -What should we do? -You should go! -All right. -That hurts! Wait. Let me deal with this one, you can handle the others. -All right. -Okay. Hey, who are you? Why don't I know you? -Of course not, I have a higher rank. -The secret code! -What secret code? -Listen up. "Moonlight before my bed. Could it be frost instead? Head up, I watch the moon." What comes next? Everyone knows it. "Head down, I think of home." Wrong, it's supposed to be, "London Bridge is falling down"! -What? -What? -So different? -So different? Damn it. Change the color and it'll be fine. It's a good thing that grandpa passed away early. We should have done this just now. -It's the guys in red now. -That's right. It would probably be fine. What can we do? Walk slowly, so that we won't alert them. -But we're in black. -They won't know if you don't tell. -Really? -Kill him! Don't come near me. Keep it up. TOFU Damn it. -Does it hurt? -Yes! That's strange. The martial art of In-between? The more objects there are in between, the more powerful it is! Is this the long lost martial art of In-between? Disperse! You should let one of you stand in between. Do you still want to run? -Boss, are you all right? -Boss, are you all right? -Are you all right? -Boss! There are nine in between. You're in trouble this time! Couldn't reach the end of the street? Damn it. -Boss, are you all right? -Boss, are you all right? -Boss. -Boss. Hey! Where's Tiger Lui? He's dead! Here he is! Who killed him? I don't know. SOUTH CITY, DONGJIADU ROAD Mr. Ding, Tiger Lui is dead. How? A kid killed him with a punch. Good grandson, are you all right? -That's Ding Lik. -Mr. Ding? Mr. Ding, how are you? Young man, thank you. Thank you for avenging Man-keung. Man-keung? -Are you talking about Hui Man-keung? -Yes. He was killed by Tiger Lui yesterday. What? -Serves him right. -Hey! I mean it serves Tiger Lui right. I have sent a lot of men to take revenge, but I couldn't find him. I didn't expect him to die in your hands. Nice one, young man. -Did someone die? -Mr. Ding, it's the police. Ching, take care of him. -I'll be heading home with them. -Yes. Can we just walk away when so many of them are dead? This is Shanghai. I have sworn that anyone who avenged Man-keung can have his three wishes granted. I have told you many times. I only have one wish which is to return to Hong Kong in 1991. It's not that. You said that you came from Hong Kong and the year 1991 to boot. I just find it hard to believe. You can't find this watch in your time. Take a look. Also... This is a mobile phone, a product of 1991. Do you call this a phone? I'll believe you if somebody answers your call. I can call people in my time. I can even let you speak to them. Show me. It's still busy. The line is busy, but you can still hear something. Someone is speaking in English. It's just a box that makes a strange noise. You can't prove it's a phone. I really talked to somebody in 1991 through it. The line is just busy right now. It will work later and only then you'll believe me. It doesn't matter which year you are from. Even if you really did come from Hong Kong of 1991, you're now in Shanghai, year 1937. There's no way back. Why don't you stay and help me? Great! Grandson. Thank Mr. Ding for thinking so highly of you. Does it mean I have to join the triad? What's wrong? Everyone in Shanghai is a triad member. He, you and I are all triad members. -You're not. -I am! You're an effeminate man. You can't be a triad member. Get back here. Listen up. I hate it the most when people say that I'm an effeminate man. -You are. -I'm a triad member! -So you're an effeminate triad member. -No! I'm the top killer of triad society! Look at him. -No, I'm a triad top killer! -You're not. All right, you're a top killer. -But an effeminate top killer. -No, I'm not an effeminate man. -You are. -I'm not! -I hate that. -Not open for debate. -No dispute. -Don't call me that. -You are. -I'm not! -No! -What are you doing? Listen to me! You're extremely effeminate. Face it! I'm a triad member. -What a nuisance. -I really am a triad member! -Throw him out to the street, please. -All right. Throw him out. -Yes, Mr. Ding! -Yes, Mr. Ding! Don't come closer or I'll beat you. Grandson, help me! No, I didn't mean it! Hey! No one should say things for fun before me. This is your first wish. Hold it! I want him to be healthy and live a long life. Fine, let him go. -Thank you. -That was your second wish. -What? -What? What a fool, you just wasted two wishes. Tell me your third wish and it's settled for me. -I-- -Wait. We want a lot of jewelry, pretty ladies, and macho men to protect us. -Four Mercedes-- -Jeez! Greed will get you nowhere! Mr. Ding, it's simple. -I wish I can get three more wishes. -What? Good! Greed is the driving force for a man. I like greedy guys like you. So much better than hypocrites. Keep this gold coin. Return it to me when you're in need. I'll try my best to satisfy them. Right, what's your name? -I-- -Son-of-a-bitch! -You're called Son-of-a-bitch. -Damn you! My name is Chow Sing-cho. Sing, stay in Shanghai. You have the potential to become a great personage in Shanghai. How can you tell? It's because of your greed. Thank you, but Mr. Ding, I don't want to be a great personage in Shanghai. You have to believe what I just said. I only want to return to my time. I haven't figured out a way to go back, but I must-- Sing, let it be. We'll talk it over after Man-keung's funeral tomorrow. Can you get through? Are you lying to me? You couldn't get through for two days? What exactly is this? I don't know why. -I want to take a piss. -What? Hey, hold it. There's not even a tree around here. -I did, but I'm afraid I can't hold it. -I know. I have a family heirloom. -It can cure your desire to piss. -Really? -Yes. -Give it to me, hurry. Here. I have been using it since I was a kid. Mr. Ding. The Mayor and Ms. Yu Sin have arrived. Hey! -I have seen her before. -What is this? What? It's our family heirloom. Is it nice? I have seen the girl in black with the hat before. -When? -Before you hung yourself. I have seen her before. Although she looks different, it's the same person. -So what? -Nothing. Screw it. Mr. Ding. I'm very sorry about Mr. Hui. What a great loss. Thank you, Mayor. Are you still calling me Mayor? You're acting like a stranger. -Yu Sin. -Lik. Right, I met a new friend. Let me introduce him to you. Is that so? Where is he? Sing, come here. Yes. He is Chow Sing-cho, the young man who killed Tiger Lui with a single punch. Mr. Chow, nice to meet you. We have met and we're very close to each other. Have you met? Mr. Chow, I'm afraid you have mistaken it. Remember the time by the riverside? Sing. Yu Sin is the daughter of the Mayor. -Mayor! -She's also my best friend. Really? You said that you met her, but she doesn't seem to know you. Mr. Ding, Wong Kam-kwai is here. Mr. Ding, who's that? A hypocrite! Grandson. He's the sworn brother of Tiger Lui. Mr. Ding's sworn enemy. He's the man behind the death of Hui Man-keung. Sorry that I'm late, Mr. Ding. It's fine. No one here will mind. Mr. Ding, you're indeed frank. I am here to talk business with you. I hope it's not the one you talked about with the late Man-keung. Ms. Kawashima Yoshiko admires your talent. Hui Man-keung was a fool. Mr. Ding, you are a smart person. I think you know how to seize the opportunity. I could tell that he's a cunning guy. I could even tell what he's going to say. Go and tell the Japanese. I, Ding Lik, will do anything, but I'll never betray my country. "We give you an out, but you won't take it." We give you an out, but you won't take it. How dare you talk to me like that! -"Great, let's go." -Great, let's go! You're amazing. You knew what he wanted to say. There's a standard format for cunning guys' dialogues. -All TV series in our time use that. -What? Mr. Ding, run! Hairy, protect Mr. Ding. I'll cover you. Watch out! It's very dangerous. Don't move. Hairy! Hairy! Mr. Ding, the machine guns are among the rocks over there. -Over there, kill him! -Yes! -Find a way to save Lik. -Don't worry, no one can hurt him. No one can see him! -How come? -I can't see him. -Where is he? -Look around! -Split up! -Yes. -How about over there? -He's not here! -Over here? -No! How are you? I have overused my power. Grandson! How are you? Grandson. Hey, Grandson! -It's fine. -Don't be afraid. -Don't go. -I won't go. -Did you see a ghost? -Damn you. How are you feeling? It exhausted my vital energy. Hey. Do you really know magic? They couldn't see Mr. Ding after you did that. Actually, this is called... If I say I know magic, will you believe me? I will! -Will you? -Yes! If I say that I came from outer space, would you believe me too? -Yes. -How about me being your grandson? -I believe you too. -Don't you think this is very stupid? -Extremely. -Yet you believe it? I do. -Why? -I don't know why. However, I found you very familiar when I first saw you. You won't hurt me. -Really? -Yes! I won't hurt you because you're truly my grandpa. Grandson. Grandpa. Grandson! -Grandpa. -Grandson. Where's Ms. Yu Sin? She has left. She asked me to tell you that she has never met you. It's impossible. Maybe she's too shy to admit. You're screwed. You're in love. I'm not, stop talking nonsense. You are! You look so horny that your looks betray you! -Really? -Indeed! Can you tell now? There's no difference. -How about this? -Even more so! -I think this should be fine. -What? Goodness, this is the worst. Ms. Yu Sin could tell, too. -Of course! -Well, I have to remove all the obstacles. Get rid of all enemies who fight back and... -I'll go after her. -What? -Hold on. -What is it? I should figure out how to return to my time. -I shouldn't think of anything else. -Have you figured it out? -Not yet. -Go after her first, then. -No way! -Why? Mr. Ding is so kind to us. He even gave us money to start a business and he seems to like Ms. Yu Sin too. -If I do that-- -Don't be silly. Everyone has the freedom to love. It's a fair competition. -And more importantly... -Yes? You're so ugly. You might not win her over. Father. I have sinned. Everyone is a sinner. But I even want to commit a sin now and I can't help it. Pray and ask God to give you strength, so that you can control yourself. If I really commit a sin, will God forgive me? If you have sinned and you genuinely regret it, God will surely forgive you. I'm relieved, then. -Don't you think it's crowded in here? -I'm sorry. How is it? Is it settled? Of... Of course. Does Miss Yu sin come here daily -at this time? -Yes. Look, she's here. Let's get started. Thank you, Father. Ms. Yu Sin, are you here to confess? Great, this Father is really amazing. I'll leave you two alone, bye. -Spring, wait for me outside. -All right. Father, I have sinned. Well... Everyone is a sinner. Father, why is your voice different? I had a dream and saw God last night. I even saw the Holy Mary. We talked a lot and now my throat is sore. -We talked about you. -Me? Turns out that you're an angel from heaven. You have to choose the right man for you and your Mr. Right is already there. Mr. Right? Have I met him? Yes, you did and he rescued you once. Have you noticed a handsome man who rescued you? A handsome man? No. The one who rescued me looked dumb. He looks rather handsome, but a little dumb. It's a destined love, be quick or you'll lose him. Don't ruin the plan God has for you. -Is there anything nice to see? -Yes. Sing is great at courting girls. Ms. Yu Sin has completely fallen for his trick. Isn't the priest inside? Of course not. You'll have seven sons and eight daughters in the future. You'll live in Jardine's Lookout in Hong Kong. You'll have five cars-- Father, your dream seems to be getting too long. Believe me and you'll be fine. Hey, the one inside isn't the priest. Also, I'm not done yet. -Who is it? -I want to come inside. No, it's crowded in here. Are you disguising as the priest to go after the girls, you sex maniac? Who is the sex maniac? Where? -Is it you? -Stop denying it. Well... Spring, let's go. Ms. Yu Sin! Sorry, I have no evil intentions. I just wanted to-- I won't tell Mr. Ding about this. Thank you. But there won't be a next time. -Grandson. -Shoot. We went too far and even got scolded. It was worse for me as I got kicked. But I don't know why, I really like her. -Who? -The one who kicked me. What is it now? I think it's hopeless. Hi, please take a photo. -It's Mr. Ding. -Mr. Ding is here. Mr. Ding. My casino's business is as good as the past ten years. If you don't mind, come and help me. Sure. Small. Large is 18 times, why are you betting on small? I know. I can see through that. It's 14 points, large. But I want to lose. Mr. Ding, would you mind? Come on! Sing. What's upsetting him? Will you beat me if I don't tell you? -No. -Then, I won't tell. Sing. -It's 14 points, large. -Sing. -Could he really see through it? -Mr. Ding! Congratulations. -I'm honored to have the Mayor here. -It's my pleasure. Sing. Hi. How come the two of them are here? Ignore them. I have talked it over with Wong Kam-kwai. He denied everything he did at the cemetery. I expected that. Mr. Ding, Wong Kam-kwai is here. Congratulations, Mr. Ding! I wish your casino every success. You're not welcome here. I see. Mr. Ding, you can choose not to welcome me, but you can't refuse Ms. Kawashima Yoshiko, the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Nice to meet you, Mr. Ding! Your cheeks don't turn red and you're not out of breath. You're indeed very talented, Ms. Kawashima. I'm impressed. You're flattering me. Ms. Kawashima, I'm too tired. I couldn't stand it. I just thought she was that great, but it turned out to be her stand-in. Scram! Mr. Ding, I'm a straightforward person. You want your casino to make money and I want to win money. What do you want to bet on? Sic bo. How many chips can I exchange for two boxes of gold? Give her ten million francs. Yes, Mr. Ding. Sing, wake up. Someone's here to throw down the gauntlet. Please, Ms. Kawashima. Tai Kwan. It's eight points, small. All right, bet everything on small. It's eight points, small. -Awesome. -That's right. Pay her and shake the dice well. One, two, three. Six points, small. Open it. One, two, three. Six points, small. -Goodness! -Amazing, they won again. -Pay her. -They won both rounds. Mr. Ding, we can't keep doing this. Looks like he can see through the cover. -He can see through the cover? -Yes. -Find a way to wake Sing. -Yes. -Sing. -Hey. This is the most powerful awakening pill. Anyone who's drunk will wake up after taking it. Give it to him, hurry. -Sing. -Hey, wake up. -He's awake. -Indeed. -What is it? -There's a guy. -He won a lot of money. -Really? Tai Kwan! -Sing. -Hey. What kind of pill is that? He fell asleep again. -That's how it is. -Well... Let's take our chances. -It's large! -Ms. Yu Sin. Please lend us a hand or Mr. Ding will lose all his money. How can I help? Come over here. -Hey, wake up. -Come over. Please help us out. -How do I help him? -Lower your head. Sing, I'm Yu Sin. How are you? Ms. Yu Sin, did you kiss me? Can you rinse your mouth first next time? Mr. Ding, it's so easy to win the Sic Bo game. You might have to close your business after this game. You're opening and closing your business on the same day. What a coincidence. I'm not afraid of you winning since I run this business. I'm just afraid of how little you bet. All right, I'm betting all on this game. If not, I'm a bitch. -Shake the dice. -Hold on! Tai Kwan, you're still alive? -That's great. -How come you're not dead? -Let's step aside. -Why are you not dead yet? We're friends. Move! Why are you not dead yet? You're not dead either, so why can't I be alive? Forget it, let's stop fighting. I didn't expect to see you here. We should be on the same side. Let's find a way to return to 1991. I'm not going with you. Ms. Kawashima thinks highly of me. There's plenty of fortune for me. If I go back to 1991, I would only get around 100 yuan per month. What for? Hey, you don't want to go back, but I want to. Please help me. -Let's use our power together. -Hey. I'm coming here to make Ding Lik go bankrupt. -I don't have time for you! -Hey! Fine, if you're not helping me, don't think about beating Ding Lik! Sing, are you confident? Bet! Damn it. I can't see the one at the bottom. Is it one or six? If it's one, it's small. If it's six, then it's large. Small or large? Are you done yet? It's small, don't bother staring. Large or small? Or Alls? Don't bet for this round. Why not? Do you want to be a bitch? Large or small? I couldn't see clearly. Cut the crap. I never fail. Perhaps, it's large. All right, bet on large. It's eight points, small! Wonderful! I told you what it was, yet you still placed the wrong bet. It's better to consult the shit than you. Your man has such a special power. I'm so impressed. But you should give me a chance to win it back. We'll play cards at your casino in ten days. Mr. Ding, don't worry. I'll give you my full support. All right, let's see what other tricks you have. If I lose again, Wong Kam-kwai and I will never show up in Shanghai. The same rule applies to you. The Mayor will be the witness. Mr. Ding, don't fall for it. If she wins, there won't be a place for me. Fine, it's a deal. Let's go! Hold on! Where's Uncle Tat? You'll find out soon. Hey, Tai Kwan! Hey, let's give our applause to Sing! -Amazing! -Amazing! -Amazing! -No need for that. -Amazing! -Amazing! The nightclub wishes Mr. Ding Lik every success for his casino and wishes he beats all Japanese, also finds his true love. I didn't expect Sing to be so good. Do you want to have a drink? Cheers. Right. Sing has a special power. Isn't it amazing? He's the one who has it, not you. I have one too. You're lying. No, I'll prove it to you. Come on. Is your ear real? Come on. Sing, excuse me. -What? -Come here. What is it? Does it only work when something is in between? Yes, what is it? Punch me. Bring it on! You're a nuisance. Take this! Did Yu Sin's kiss make me forget "In-between"? Let me check it out. -Are you all right? -No. -How is it? -It hurts. -It hurts? What a pity. -Are you hurt? -I'm not fine. -What a pity. You're so bad! Spring! Making money is important for a man. I'll give you some. What business would you like to do? Chow Tai-fook Jewelry Co. I know nothing about jewelry. I only know how to sell buns. -You can't make a lot by selling buns. -You're right. But I know one who becomes rich by selling buns. -Really? -He's called McDonalds. What a strange name. It's a household name! We have a film director called Mak Dong Hong, then a singer named Madonna. All of them are so rich. I'll call myself McDonfook. You'll be richer than ever. -I'll set up a McDonfook Bakery. -Thank you, Mr. Ding! -Try your best. -I will. I'm so happy today. Sing helped me defeat the Japanese. I have a good friend like Ms. Yu Sin and support from all my friends. I have good news to announce. -What? -What? Ms. Yu Sin and I will be engaged next month. That's great! Hey, Sing? Sing, are you all right? Hey, don't scare me. He has seen a few doctors, but there isn't any progress. I'm worried. That's right. Why is he like that? I know a very good German doctor. I'll ask him to come over. A doctor can't heal lovesickness. -What did you say? -What? I think we need ginseng to cure him. I have plenty of it. Needless to say, he can have it for every meal. I would do anything to have him recover. The future of Shanghai depends on him. Look after him. -Ms. Spring. -What is it? Nothing, it's just that what Sing has is lovesickness. Who does he love? I'll tell you, but don't tell others. -Of course! -All right. He loves Ms. Yu Sin. What? -Is he stealing Ding Lik's girlfriend? -No! The first time he saw Ms. Yu Sin was by the river. She was in white and riding a horse. She even smiled at him. But she didn't want to talk to him the second time. He's at a loss right now. -Could it be... -What? Nothing! If we can ask Ms. Yu Sin to keep him company for a day, -will he still be like that? -He won't. -Do you think he can regain his power? -Definitely! Fine. Tomorrow, I'll... No, I should ask her now. Nanny. Ms. Yu Sin is not in. I'm here for Yu Mong. She's playing in her room. A German doctor checked up on her. What did he say? He said she suffered from meningitis when she was small. That obstructed her growth. Her intelligence is like a five-year-old child. There's no cure. -I'll check up on her. -Okay. -Yu Mong! -Yes? Spring! Do you know him? Yes. Let me bring you to see him. Sure. MCDONFOOK -Guys, come out. -What is it? Look! Milk tea. Sweet bean bun, anyone? Here you go. This one is for you. Sing, it's the opening ceremony for my store today. Why are you looking so silly? There's no more hope. She's marrying someone else. Find another one. It's over. Can you say something else? It's over. Fook! Spring! Look who's here. Look who's here. -Fook! -Spring! I have brought her here. Are you really engaged? No. Mr. Ding was just kidding. -Really? -Yes, it's true. Did you hear that? She isn't engaged! Let's dance and celebrate! She's not Yu Sin. She's Yu Mong, Yu Sin's sister. She has the intelligence of a five-year-old child. She's only a kid. Pork buns! -Let's dance! -Let's dance! Hey! -It's very bouncy! -Hang in there for a while. It's not nice to eat! It's tasteless. I think this one is better. Spring! What? Look at how happy Sing and Yu Sin are. I told you that she's Yu Mong. She's only a five-year-old kid. -Silly. -But they're happy. "Mong" means dream. It's a romantic name. What? Romance. Right, I have a name in mind with the word "dream" which suits you. -What is it? -Withered dream. Damn you. I was just kidding. Look at how beautiful it is. Right? Don't run away! -Spring! -I'll kill you. Spring! -Yu Sin seems so strange. -What? How strange? She doesn't talk and she only smiles. Right. That's right, she speaks French. Really? Teach me, I don't know how to speak French. But you should have a French name first. -Give me one. -Well... You're called Comment Allez-vous. Wait up. -Is there a better name? -This one is fine! Don't run away! -Comment Allez-vous. -All right. -Comment Allez-vous. -All right. Let's kiss tonight? Back so soon? That's right. Sing, come here and have some tea. -Okay. -Okay. Mr. Ding! Sing, what happened to your mouth? A cat bit me. Where have you been today? For an outing. I'm so happy. You have to be careful. Kawashima Yoshiko and Wong Ka Kwai are ruthless. They can do anything. I am counting on you for the gamble that is taking place in ten days. Don't worry, Mr. Ding. -Yu Sin. -Yes? I have something for you. Something new from France. Change your plaster. -Sure. -Come on. Mr. Ding, excuse me. Sing is a very talented and excellent gambler, but he seems crazy most of the time. I must find him a girlfriend. What type of girls does he like? How would I know? Don't make a scene. -Listen to me. -She's coming. Ms. Yu Sin! I understand. Mr. Ding is here, so you dare not talk to me. Do you have time tomorrow? Let's go out again. What are you saying? I don't get it. No one is around. Don't treat me like that. We had so much fun today. Please don't cross the line. It serves you right. -They are like two different people. -That's right, they are... -No, listen to me. -Of course you would say that. You neglected me the moment you found Spring. You're wrong, it's an unrequited love. I don't know what Spring thinks. Let me tell you, Spring is my grandma. -So she's your... -My mom! -Your wife! -What? Your wedding picture is still hanging in my home in 1991. Really? I have told you about it, so it's up to you whether to believe it. -What is it? -I want to throw up! You should. What's that noise? -The phone is ringing! -It is! Mr. Ding! Mr. Ding! Look at this! -He's not around, just answer the call. -Okay. -Hello! -Sing, I'm Lung Ng. You finally called me. It couldn't get through in the past two days. I couldn't get through either. Listen carefully. I'm currently stuck in Shanghai back in 1937. What? It's ridiculous, but you have to believe me. I'm stuck in Shanghai of year 1937. How did that happen? It's because I fought Tai Kwan with my power! As far as I know, the power at its height will change the time and space and I was sent into the time tunnel. What should I do? Try and find some men with special power. Use the same method and see if they can bring me back. All right, I got it. Here is our latest anti-terrorist equipment. A five-foot seven-inch flesh body. An automatic pistol with a grenade and a gas mask. -Hello? -Here's another one. -Hold on. -They wouldn't be able to escape. -What? Who's talking? -A gun with an infrared detector, take it. Hold on. -Sing, I'll find a way to save you. -Why are you talking so much with him? I'm Commissioner Wong. Who are you? Did you just ask me who I am? I'm 1937 Shanghai's Saint of Gamblers! I'm Fatal Scissors Leg! Be it 1937 or 1997. Cut the crap, I'm rushing for a meeting! Pass it back to Lung Ng, or I'll smash your head with a punch! You'll smash my head? My legs will break your neck instead! Don't bother talking to him! Hello? Don't hang up yet, it's hard to get through! He really is in Shanghai, stuck in 1937. Are you saying that you're able to call him from here? Don't take me for a fool even if you wanted to skip the meeting. Isn't that Sing? How did Yu Mong meet him? Ding Lik will definitely die, right? Of course. If my daughter marries Ding Lik, he won't put up a guard against me. We can kill him before the wedding banquet. He'll die for sure. Our efforts to cultivate you wasn't in vain. We let you become the Mayor and you're indeed helpful. Thank you for your help. -Thank you. -Hold it. Say no more, just kill Ding Lik first. No need to worry about Chow Sing-cho. Hello? Did you hear the things we said? Go away. I don't want to talk to a traitor. I'm a traitor? What about your dad? He's not a traitor! Right, he's not a traitor. He's the dog of traitors! Did you just hit me? Yu Sin! Why did you push my daughter down there? -She heard everything! -Stop fighting! This is not the time to hold anyone accountable. Your daughter is dead. Who will Ding Lik marry? Her! She... She's my daughter, but she is mentally handicapped. Really? It doesn't matter. What matters is that she resembles Yu Sin. Be good and drink up. Remember. You're no longer Yu Mong now, you're Yu Sin. Ding Lik is your fiance. I'll beat you to death if you don't do as I say. Drink it! -Mayor. -Yes? Hey, Lik! How is Ms. Yu Sin? It's nothing serious, she just caught a cold. Yu Sin, how are you? Yu Sin, are you all right? -Ms. Yu Sin! -Yu Sin. Yu Sin. Sing is our very good friend, but you can't do that. She's acting strangely because she's not feeling well. Don't be like that. Mr. Ding! No. -Mr. Ding! -Lik! -Mr. Ding! -Lik! Although I'm handsome, you shouldn't do that in front of Mr. Ding. Did you get that? Hey! I hope you won't cross the line. Please don't be like this. You keep treating me differently that I'm at a loss. What do you want? Tell me. -Where's Mr. Ding? -He left. He asked you to meet him at the club. -He has something important to discuss. -All right. Sing, why did Mr. Ding ask for you? It's been hours, yet he's still not here. That's right. Why is that? Is he mad that you stole his girl? He wants to take revenge on you. Don't be silly. How is that possible? Let's play safe. -Let's go. -Hey. -This isn't a good idea. -Why? When Hui Man-keung stepped out of here the other night, he was shot to death. If we step outside, I wonder... We have waited this long anyway, let's wait a little longer. -Until when? -Until when? CLOSED FOR ONE DAY Is there anyone? No. -No. -Take a good look. It's fine, don't worry. -Nothing happened, right? -We can't be too careful. You're right. Wong Kam-kwai? Hey! Don't touch me yet, I have been shot a dozen times. It's Wong Kam-kwai. Why is the Mayor with him? The Mayor is also a traitor. It was Mr. Wong instead of Mr. Ding who asked you to come. You're a traitor too. If not for your age, I would have beaten you up. That's right. You won't do it? Then I will. What? -Hey! -Why did you... You have lost your value. Hey! Who are you? He's Mr. Gorokuro Sugata, Ms. Kawashima's best fighter. Sing, help me! Help me! -Rescue him. -Help me. Are you Grandpa or Uncle Tat? He's Uncle Tat. Both Tai Kwan and he fell into my hands. -Grandson! -What do you want? You're a smart guy. Therefore, you should know what I want. What? Grandpa, Uncle Tat, in order to save both of you, I have to give myself up to this female beast. All right, bring it on! -That hurts! -Damn you. You thought I would like a skinny guy like you? I want you to kill Ding Lik. Kill Ding Lik? That's impossible! I'm greatly indebted to him so I will never do that. You won't? Wong Kam-kwai, the punishment. -Pull! -Don't! -Yes. -Watch out! No, I'm being pulled apart! You don't know him well. My uncle is a hero. He won't give in because of that. Just do it! Dad, I can't believe he said such things. You refuse to give in until you're faced with grim reality. Bring them out! -Fook! -Yu Sin! Spring! Spring! Sing, don't trust them! She's not Yu Sin! She's Yu Mong! She has the intelligence of a five-year-old child! What did you say? They are twins. Ding Lik loves the elder sister. While the one you like is the mentally handicapped sister. Mentally handicapped? Where's Yu Sin, then? She has been killed by that scumbag! That's right, I killed her. What can you do to me? Let him off! Take the two of them to-- No, they won't stand it. She hasn't finished her sentence, yet you said that they can't? Shut up, they really can't. I promise you, just let them go. Take them inside and let Chow Tai-fook go. How about me? -Continue with the punishment. -No! I have untied you. You may go. Use your hands, come on. Trying to act cool. -Haven't they been cut off? -What do you think? -Come on! -Yes. Loosen him! Damn it. What do you want us to do? Get Ding Lik's head. Get Mr. Ding's head? It's no use forcing me, I just couldn't kill him. -That's right. -Hypnotize yourself. Make yourself hate him, then you'll be able to do it. -Hypnotize? -Repeat after me. I must kill this fucking Ding Lik! "Kill this fucking Ding Lik"! She shouted like that in front of me. She sounded hysterical and looked so horrible. I realized she was a fool, so I ignored her and walked out of there. It's such a dangerous place, yet you managed to just leave? It's because I have a special power. You can't see me. That's how I escaped. Mr. Ding, please take a seat over here. It's not that simple. The Japanese must have a set-up. We can't lose the gamble, scheduled the day after tomorrow. Sing, do you love listening to loud music? What did you say? Again! I couldn't hear you! What? Mr. Ding, don't worry. I know the Japanese will surrender eight years later. It's because the Americans bombed... Brilliant. The durian is hard. Do you want to try some? Sing. What is it that you want to tell me? Sir, the milk is in your study room. GIFT FROM FAMILY Mr. Ding, let's play some chess. Sing. Answer me. What is it? Do you really like Ms. Yu Sin? Why are you asking me that? To me, friends are more important than women. Especially when the country now depends on you. I'll withdraw myself and give you my blessing, if you really like Yu Sin. Then you can concentrate on fighting the Japanese for our country. Sing, are you all right? I'm fine. I just think that you're being too nice to me. I feel so ashamed. Mr. Ding! I feel thirsty, let me take a sip. I think I took more than a sip. You can drink whatever you want here, but don't do that out there. The Japanese use a kind of drug to poison important Chinese figures. Many great fighters died because of it. The drug has several symptoms. First, you'll feel extremely excited. Second, smoke will come out of you. Third, you can't control your limbs. Then you'll feel cold, get a cramp, and die. Sing, are you fine? I'm... I'm fine! Are you fine? -I am. -You look pale. I'll be fine after I sit down. -Are you sure? -It feels much better. You look pale. Let me get you a doctor. Sing! Yes! I look nice in this leather tie. Come in! Don't sneak around out there. Why didn't you kill him? Sing, have you defected to the Japanese? I have no choice. Kawashima Yoshiko kidnapped my uncle and Yu Mong. She even threatened to kill them. Yu Mong? That's right, she's Yu Sin's twin sister. I have been mistaking her for Yu Sin. The Mayor is a traitor. Ms. Yu Sin was killed by Wong Kam-kwai. The one we visited was Yu Mong, not Yu Sin. So you're back to kill me? You know, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Mr. Ding, you have been nice to me. I can't do it. Sing, take this. You're a smart guy. If killing me can save them, take it. Once you have rescued them, I hope you will kill Wong Kam-kwai and Kawashima Yoshiko, to avenge me and Yu Sin. Here. Take it. -Here. -Me? -Aren't you the top killer? -Sing! Be quick! I'm sorry, Mr. Ding. He's my son after all. Hold on! We might not have to do that. If we can get something from Mr. Ding and take it to Kawashima Yoshiko, and announce Mr. Ding's death on the newspapers, maybe we can fool her. What do you need then? These teeth are the only thing left of Ding Lik. -Only the teeth are left? -That's right! We bombed him into pieces. It's in the news. Ms. Kawashima, please let my son, Yu Mong and Spring go. Don't do it! Ding Lik is still alive! Sing. Say it again! -Sing. -What? You can really... -Sing! -Fook! -Spring! -Fook! -Spring, how are you? -Sing. -Sing. -She can say your name. -Move! -Sing! -Spring! -Fook! -Fook! -Sing! -Sing! -Move! Hey, why did you ignore Yu Mong? How can I talk to her? She's mentally handicapped. She's just a five-year-old kid. It's all your fault. You shouldn't have hidden it from me! Do you take me for a pervert? She takes me for a brother or even a father. Then you can take her for a daughter or sister, just be kind to her! You don't necessarily have to be with her! -Can I? -Of course! Sing. Don't cry, okay? Don't cry. Sing, she's crying! Sing! Talk to her. Yu Mong. Yu Mong! Sing! Yu Mong. Sing! Don't be afraid. Dad, dinner is ready. There's pork, chicken, and soup. Useless son. Giving birth to a pig is better than you! Dad, don't be mad. Shut up! You're a traitor. Listen. If you stop now and let us go, I'll still take you as my uncle. This is 76 Jessefield Road. There are many Japanese outside. You have no way out even if I let you go. How did you get caught by them? The other night, I tried searching for you. Suddenly, I ended up here instead. Kawashima Yoshiko caught me and Tai Kwan. -Did they take your phone? -How did you know? I saw and secretly used it, the call then went through to Hong Kong. -Did you? -Yes! -Who did you call? -The weather forecast! You should just die. You should have called Lung Ng! Get him to save us. Listen, that damn phone doesn't always work. -What do I do? -Call until someone answers! I'll castrate myself if you still don't come to your senses! Dad, don't do that. I'll try to make the call. It must go through. Mr. Lung, it's for you. Hello, who is this? Lung Ng! It's me, Tat! Where are you? We went into the time tunnel. We're in Shanghai, back in 1937, and now we're caught by Kawashima Yoshiko. Don't ask so many questions! We're at 76 Jessefield Road. Tell Sing that I have found men who have the special power to come to your rescue. Hurry... Hello? You said that you can take objects using telekinesis. Why doesn't it work? But I don't know how to remove it from his pants. It's wrapped around him. Right, I know how to hypnotize. I can influence the mind of others and make them take my orders. -But I must pick those who look stupid. -Why? Smart guys have strong willpower, so they're difficult to be manipulated. -This one is great. -This one is great. Take the key and let us out. Open the door! What are you doing? Open the door right away! Quick, open the door! Hurry up, I'm at my limit! You idiot! Go to hell! Look, force is the most practical thing. You're indeed a top killer. You bet! You're still an effeminate top killer. -Top killer. -Yes! Protect them and leave first. Any further mission? -Watch your steps. -All right! Let's go. -Don't look, let's go. -Let's go! -Sing! -Hurry! CHINA-JAPAN FRIENDSHIP THE IMPERIAL ARMY WILL WIN IMPERIAL EMPEROR THE IMPERIAL ARMY WILL WIN Don't move. Kick yourself. Punch yourself. Another punch! You can't manipulate me. Hello? My phone! Hello! Quick! Let's go. Be quiet. Hello? Speak up! Get Lung Ng to speak to me! Are you serious? Getting back to me this late. Late? Tell him that I'll issue an arrest warrant for him. He stole the police equipment and took away all the men with special power! I am now being held by a Nelson-style Arm Lock. I can't stand it anymore. That's a piece of cake. Raise two fingers and stab him at a 45-degree angle! Have you stabbed his eyes? No, I stabbed his nostrils instead! Then just scratch until all the air comes out. I have escaped, it works! You bet. I was the martial arts host through the phone then. Where's Lung Ng? I am being held down from the Ghost Arm Lock! That powerful? That's not something that can be taught over the phone. Get all the senior police to come in! Any ideas to counter that? This kind of lock is very powerful. How to break it off? Start discussing! -Stab his eyes! -The throat. -Surrender! -Curse you! You're now in trouble. How would you save yourself? Sir, I thought of grabbing him by the balls. Grab his balls! All right! -Did you grab them? -Yes, they're huge! -Awesome! -Be quiet. I'll teach you the fatal move, Fatal Scissors Leg. Jump in the air and put your feet against the wall. Turn 180 degrees, then use your legs to grip him! -Did he just shout? -It's me! -It was you? -What? Haven't you used Fatal Scissors Leg? I'll save that for future use. I am now caught in Yin Yang Twisted Arm Lock! "Yin Yang Twisted Arm"? -That's even more powerful. -That's right. Any solutions? Shoot him. Shoot him. I don't have a gun! You don't? Then what do you have? Just a phone. Hit him with it! You broke my phone. Give me a new one! Sing! Sing! Why did you come back? Just hit me will do. How could you hit her? I'm cutting your... No, it's Fatal Scissors Leg! -Are you surrendering? -Yes! Then say sorry. -I'm sorry. -Not to me! Apologize to her! Miss, I'm sorry. Fine. Hey! Fatal Scissors Leg is indeed impressive. Yu Mong, are you okay? It's fine. He has apologized. Don't be afraid and stop crying, good girl. She likes those ugly ones. She couldn't possibly like me. I don't get it. -Don't worry, no one sees us. -No. I told you that you won't get away from her. -No. -Keep shaking. -Hey. -What? Don't do that here, let's go home first! Let's go! Mr. Ding, it's time. Why has Sing yet to arrive? How is it? Looks like the Saint of Gamblers is not showing up. -Can you give us another 15 minutes? -Sure! We'll wait for another 15 minutes. Once the time runs out, you'll have to concede defeat. We'll take it that you lose if he doesn't show up. Remember. If you lose, you have to leave Shanghai. -Sing, can special power resist bullets? -Of course. -Great. -But you'll die afterward. Screw you. Shoot! Get down! Okay! TRIUMPH IN THE WAR Go! -Lung Ng, it's about time. -I know. Sing! Lung Ng, you came in time. -Where's Uncle Tat? -He's in the punishment room. Move quickly! The one who's seven feet tall. How did you get here? I found the Association of Special Power. A total of 45 members used their special power and sent me here. But after 15 minutes, they'll use the power again to bring us back. -Let's go. -No, not now. -Why? -Lung Ng. Sing. Go back with Lung Ng. Yu Mong and I are heading to the casino. -Look after Dad for me. -Got it! Sing, how are you getting back? Get those members to use their power after an hour. I'll use mine here. If we could connect, I might be able to go back. You might fail, just come with us. No, there's something I have to do. -That's all for now. -Hey! It has been half an hour, Mr. Ding. I guess you have nothing to say now. All right. I'll gamble on my own. What's so funny? Its because he overestimated himself. Good thing I made it in time. Ching, please look after Yu Mong for me. Also... Sorry, Mr. Ding. I'm late. It's okay, take a seat. Give me a glass of soy milk. No, a cup of tea with ice, please. Let's see how you're going to win. -What is it? -Who said that you're gambling? Get lost! Who's going to gamble with him if not me? A famous French who is known all over the world. The French God of Gamblers who has never lost. Pierre Cashon. The French God of Gamblers? If you gamble with him, what about me? Take my shoes. The French God of Gamblers does have special powers. -He looks more powerful than Tai Kwan. -Yes. Can you manage? I'll do my best. Each side has chips worth ten million francs. The one who is out of chips is the loser. I want to examine the cards. -Amazing. -Amazing. -That's incredible! -So incredible. The cards are fine. My turn. A piece of cake. Fine for me too. The game begins. French God of Gamblers. Show me your hand. Are you pulling the same trick again? What's wrong with it? That's my usual move! I'll call. -The hell? -What's the matter? Nothing. Mutual interference of special power messes things up. Let's do it again. I want a Queen. Who's that? So ugly! I don't want a chick. I want a Queen! Queen! Damn, I've used up all my power. Reveal your card. Sure, you go first. You first. You first. So you won't go first? That's right, you can go first. But I don't want to go first. Let's not gamble. How about we just divide the money? Hey! What are you two doing? Kids shouldn't interfere with matters of adults. We're not opening the cards, it's a draw. Next game. -Yes. -Hey. Are you all right? -I have used up my power for now. -What? Don't worry. He's in the same predicament. I have to bet with him without using power. Let's see who is the lucky one. Time to bid. Don't bother asking, it's an all-in. Sorry, it's not your turn yet. -Yours is only a two. -What? -Please bid. -All-in. What a good boy. You're so obedient. This is fun, it's an all-in for me too. Can I put half of them on hold? No way. I know that, of course. I don't need you to teach me. Hold on, I want to raise the bet. Do you want to raise the bet? By betting your head? You're right! I want your head. Mr. Ding. Ms. Yu Sin was killed by this scumbag. So I'm betting my head with his. Are you out of your mind? Just don't call for it if you're scared. Fine, bet on your head! -Ms. Kawashima. -Who are you to call the shots? You should be prepared to die since you're serving in the Imperial Army. If not, why would we pay you so much? Kid, don't bother looking. It's here with me. A Flush and above three-of-a-kind. How about a Full House? I want your head, your parents and relatives'. Including Ms. Kawashima Yoshiko over there, with the heads of her parents, all of her relatives and ancestors, just give me all of their heads! Use your power to change the card. Hurry. You'll get rewards if I win. Fine, I'll use my power. -Damn-- -Hey. Don't. Did you forget about me? I've used my power and gave your three of hearts to your opponent. Now they have a Flush. Take care. Fine, you cursed my relatives. The same goes with you. Show us your cards. Mr. Chow Sing-cho, please reveal your deck. Open... Reveal your cards. You were so arrogant just now. Do it. In this book, it says that... he was beaten once by a mysterious guy, called Comment Allez-vous. I will, but wait a second! Ladies and gentlemen, is there anyone here who goes by the name, Comment Allez-vous? If there is, please step forward. Mr. Ding, do you know such a person? Why are you looking for him? It's difficult to explain. I need him to win this game. You are Comment Allez-vous. Stop joking around, we'll be executed if we lose. Who's joking? Take a look for yourself. "The French God of Gamblers, Pierre Cashon, versus the Chinese Saint of Gamblers, Comment Allez-vous"? Am I Comment Allez-vous? Since when did I have such a name? I asked Spring if you have a foreign name. She told me you're called Comment Allez-vous. Don't you know? Am I? The book said Comment Allez-vous won. Was it a lie? That's impossible. Tai Kwan knows how to swap cards. They surely have a Flush. But how can I win? Could the book be wrong? Open your card or you'll lose, then all of you will be executed. Mr. Chow Sing-cho, open your card or you'll lose. It can't be wrong. What are you doing? Will Jesus help me and return the card to me? Are you out of your mind? That's right. I think only Jesus can help you now. You're right. That's the only way. Lord Jesus, help me out! Do you want a three? Mine is! It is indeed three, but is his Two Pairs of higher rank? His is Two Pairs. Yours is an Ace, Queen, Jack, two and three, so he wins. Thank you, Jesus! I'm not Jesus. Do I look like Him? Why did you keep swapping the cards? Hey! What about this game? If I didn't do that, will you fall into my trap? You're a traitor! How much did they pay you? That's not the point. I just can't stand you anymore! I'm not a man if I don't beat you up! Curse you, bitch! Wong Kam-kwai, give me your head! Don't come any closer! If you come any closer, I'll blow her head off! Sing expected you would do this. It looks so horrible. You may punish me as you wish. Next time, I wouldn't have won without you. Why is it so windy? They're using their power to bring me back. But I have used up all my power, so I can't link with them. -I'll help you one more time. -What? Thank you so much. Mr. Ding, people from my time are bringing me back. I have to go now, bye. -Really? -Yes. Sing, take care. I will. When I get back there, I'll tell everyone that the real Ding Lik is much better looking than the one on the TV. What are you talking about? That's all. Tai Kwan, you're helping me. What about you? Don't bother about me. I'd rather stay and be rich. I'm using my power now. Get ready! All right. Come with me. Yu Mong! Hurry! Are you really taking her there? Yes, I'll take her back to the '90s. Heal her and turn her back to normal. No way! -What's the matter? -Look at her! -Why is she turning like this? -She lives in the '30s. She'll die of old age in the '90s. Quickly push her away! Sing! Mr. Ding! My final wish. Please take care of Yu Mong for me. Don't worry. I'll take good care of her. Yu Mong! Are you really going back to the U.S.? Yes, I want to focus on the art of gambling with my mentor and forget the past. You better be learning instead of hitting on girls. I won't. I don't think I'll ever be in love again. Yu Mong? -Yu Mong! -Little brat! Wait for me! Subtitle translation by Angel Choo
