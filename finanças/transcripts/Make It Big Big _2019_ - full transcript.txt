He says people age in an instant. What does that mean? It means you don't grow old from getting your first wrinkle or your first gray hair. Instead... Tears fall on a rainy night It's from Liu Chia-chang's "Petals of Tears." It's originally a Korean song. - Is that so? - From a 1968 film. But what I don't get is, could you explain... Where do I seek you on a rainy night? So your name is Mark Lee-kerberg. Let's just call you Mark Lee. - Mark Lee-kerberg. - Doesn't sound that good. Why not make it Mark Little Bird? No. - Mark Little Bird? - Yes! Hello! He gets mad easily, so make it Mark Angry Bird! You're short like a little bench. A little bench indeed. Little bench, long shoulder pole. You are a short and old bench. Last time, I went filming and we went to the SPCA at the east side, then... SPCA, what SPCA? Right, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. A banana a day, a doctor ba doh yao. - What is ba doh yao? - Ba doh yao means hungry. He has no patients, so he will have no income and be hungry. Good morning, 972. "Today is my dog, Snowy's fifth birthday." Hoping we will sing it a birthday song. Its name is Snowy. I've never thought I would need to please a dog. No, you cannot put it this way. Okay, let's sing the birthday song. - Get ready. - One, two, three. Thank you! Thank you, everyone! Thank you for the support. I'm happy and very grateful to my three partners. I would like to thank everyone for their support too. Our looks are weird. - What? - We are tall, short, skinny, and fat. Why look at me when you said "fat"? Who else am I supposed to look at? That's too much! However, when the four of us get together, we are strong and unbeatable. Yes. I won't forget the listeners of Love 97.2 The Radio Quartet. Thank you, everyone. Thank you! To everyone who has supported us all these years, you are our angels. I must say you are angels with good taste! That's right, thank you! Thank you for supporting us, - The Radio Quartet! - The Radio Quartet! We are really thankful for all your support. Because of your support, The Radio Quartet was crowned the most popular DJ ensemble last night! Look at Dennis. He has been beaming since last night. Yes, we can see how happy he is. - Really. - We came in this morning and saw so many congratulatory messages in our inbox. We haven't even finished reading them. - We are so touched. - Here's one. "Congratulations on winning the most popular DJ ensemble." Thank you. "I admire Mark Lee very much. Any ordinary joke that comes from his mouth is funny." What do you mean by that? Every joke that comes from my mouth is funny. It has to come from your mouth. If not, where else? There is! Okay, here's one that's addressed to Marcus. He says, "Marcus Chin, you're very talented! You can do everything and anything! Talents like you are rare in Singapore." Honest people like you are rare too. He praises you, so he's an honest man? Marcus, don't forget to be humble. - Okay! - He mumbles a lot, hardly humble. Be low profile. - Is there any for me? - Yes, there is. Here it is, there's one for Biyu. He says, "Biyu, your voice is very nice. My legs turn into jelly when I hear you speak. My whole body feels so relaxed. I feel so good." Okay, thank you for the compliments, I will continue to work hard. Moving on, this message is for Dennis. He says, "Hi Dennis, you're so lucky. If not for the other three, you would not be able to survive until now." Not be able... - Not be able to survive. - To survive? Our listener is really humorous. Yes, that was a joke. I think he's just trying to prank us. Anyway, thank you for your criticism, I will continue to work hard. There's a nice song by Andy Lau. "High Is Low." Did Andy Lau sing this song? Yes! Yes. This song really exists. Let's listen to this song by Dicky Cheung and Andy Lau now. - "High Is Low." - "High Is Low." Leelian, you're so early? Mark, I'm here to do some editing. And to pass this to Marcus. Marcus, your fan Adeline sent you something again. Here, let's share this. Adeline must be very free to send you things every day. Adeline has a pretty good taste. Of course! I have such a good taste, she's definitely not bad too. Yes, haven't you heard before? Short people have great taste. Really? Is there such a phrase? Let's not talk about it, Even for Getai Challenge, they are looking for new talents. An old man like me can only step aside and reflect on myself. No, it can't be. There are a lot of fans holding banners with your name, shouting and cheering for you. Yes, from tens to a hundred. Do you know how much he has spent? - You had to pay for it? - You ask him. This is a secret. Dennis. Dennis! Why do you look so stressed when I mentioned "secret"? Boss just said to meet her after our shift, the four of us. - What? - She said it's a serious matter. The company has decided to make changes to The Radio Quartet. Changes? We are good the way we are now. Why make changes? The question is, what is the change? Starting from tomorrow, The Radio Quartet will be changed to The Radio Trio. "The Radio Trio"? What about me? Boss, what have I done wrong? Yes, there must at least be an explanation. It's not my decision to make. This was decided by the management. But Boss, every time you talk about "management," do you even know who they are? If you were to bring us to them, you wouldn't even know where they are. Boss, I've been working hard as a DJ all these years. I have never goofed off. Unlike some people, who missed the radio show to shoot dramas, or to host television variety shows. Others are even worse, they come when they feel like it, and skip the show when they don't. Even if someone has to leave, it shouldn't be me. Biyu. We are discussing you now. Why are you throwing the ball in my court? Biyu, they are asking you to leave, not us, why are you dragging us down? Your words are like knives, you've killed three birds with one stone. In the radio network, there's no doubt that you are very experienced, but there's one thing that you've never done well. What is it? Say it! - You're not funny. - You're not funny. What? It's my fault that I'm not funny? - Yes. - Yes. The company is looking into saving costs this year. So, I don't have a choice. Is everyone ready? Do you really want to fire me? Surprise! Happy birthday! -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you Me? -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to Biyu -Happy birthday to Biyu -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you Thank you, everyone. I'm really surprised. You guys really scare me. Relax, we are just kidding. Yes. Boss, what's inside the envelope? It's a voucher. So you are not serious about firing... How is that possible? You're not the type who goofs off. Am I right, Dennis? You're not the one with many variety shows or dramas. - Am I right, Dennis? - Hey. And not the one who goes on MC suddenly. - Am I right, Dennis? - Hey. Even if someone should be fired, it should be one of us. Am I right, Dennis? - Mark! - That is not what I meant. I'm so sorry. This is a small surprise that we've planned for you, Happy birthday! Thank you for celebrating my birthday in advance. In advance? Isn't it today? No, it's next month. Dennis! What's with you? You've known her for years and yet you got the date wrong? Isn't it this month? I'm sorry... I remembered wrongly. You have dementia at such a young age. Do you need me to recommend some doctors? Hold on, Mark, I didn't remember wrongly, the calendar did. Really? Let me see! No matter what, let's eat the cake! - Thank you. - Make a wish, blow out the candles! Jian Wen wants you to blow his candle... Okay, wishing Love 97.2FM a rising listenership! It's delicious. Thank you, everyone. Biyu, have you never eaten a birthday cake? Leave me alone! Hurry up and finish it, I have a date later on. Why do you care? Biyu's loyal fan Biyu! Biyu! Handsome! It has been a while, how are you? Okay... - Was India fun? - India was incredible. I saw your Instagram. I really wanted to buy a plane ticket to India. Sister! Who are you calling "sister"? He is my brother. - Brother? - His father and my father are the same person. His mother and my mother are different people. Half siblings. - Hello. - Hello. How is it? Did you bring my stuff? Of course. Take it out. Saruk Khan's limited-edition T-shirt. There are only two pieces in the world. One in East Coast, the other is in West Coast. Silly! But the size seems to be too big. It doesn't matter. I can wear it as pajamas. Give it to me! You're so lucky to have him sleep with you... Of course! Where is my stuff? Don't worry, I've prepared the things you wanted. The cap that Saruk Khan wore before. I spent a long time looking for it online. Even Jack Ma doesn't sell it. He really wore this before? Of course! You can check if it still bears his scent. It really smells like him! Stop fooling around, crazy! Yes, did you get to see him during this trip? He is an international star. Why would I get the chance? But... I managed to get his autographed figurine! This is very expensive! I want it no matter the price! With his signature! I also have his newest music video. Really? Show me! Goodnight, my dear. I almost forgot about you. My Yang Guo. Goodnight. Little Dragon Maiden. Goodnight! For my birthday this year, if I could have dinner with you, I would die without regrets. Little Dragon Maiden, please don't say that. The traffic is currently smooth islandwide. If there is any new traffic conditions, you can call us at 62558400 to update us. Okay, let's look at the messages. Madam Tan said, "I want to hear Dennis's voice, where is Dennis?" I think Dennis will be here after the commercial break. I'm sorry, there was a traffic jam. Traffic jam? You're here? Hurry here! Traffic jam? Are you living in Johor Bahru? "Traffic jam"? "Traffic is smooth islandwide." Where's the traffic jam? You can pair the jam with bread instead. The traffic jam happened at the car park exit of my house. Anything wrong with that? Okay, the commercial break is over. Time to turn on the microphone. Hello, good morning. This is Love 97.2FM The Radio Quartet! Still morning? Do you know what time it is now? It doesn't matter what time it is. What matters is that I'm here now. Unlike Mark, who said he'll be here but hasn't shown up. I think our show should be renamed The Radio Trio. Mark's wife, Catherine It's my sensitive nose. You don't have a sensitive nose, you're just sensitive to me. It was just a sneeze. Can you be more reasonable? Hey, who is the unreasonable one now? Is it too much trouble for you to send our kid to tuition? I've told you a million times. It's not that I find it troublesome. I just don't understand why her Mandarin tuition is in Jurong and English tuition is in Katong. A primary school kid has tuition at four different centers. Our kid will be tired. How will she have the energy to focus? I have also told you a million times. It is hard enough to get a good teacher for one subject and even harder to get one for all the subjects. Why don't you find some? I'm sure I can find tutors with money. Aren't there many Tuition Kings out there? You already said they are kings. The price is also fit for kings! I'm the local heavenly king. If money could solve the problems, it's not a problem. I'm trying to save us some money. Why are you so ungrateful? There are better ways of saving money. If I could buy some quality time for my daughter, I wouldn't mind. I've gone through a lot to get all those tutors. But I can't bear to see my daughter suffer. Do you mean I'm torturing our daughter? Why can't you understand? It's so tiring to talk to you. Okay! I'm terribly sorry for making you tired! You... Thank you, Calista. Come, Calista. Mark's daughter, Calista Have you finished your homework? Yes, I have. Very good. Pass me my phone, please. Thank you. Yes, Ding Dang? Mark, have you forgotten about the shoot today? Of course not. I'm on my way. On your way? Where are you now? I'm on my way to get changed, okay? Dad needs to leave for work. You play on your own, okay? - I can't. - Why not? I have tuition classes later. Hello everyone, this is Dennis. You are listening to Love 97.2FM. "Instant Noodles" is dedicating this song to "Spaghetti." So cute! This song is "I Made You Happy" by Rock Bang. Enjoy. Anything for me? - No. - How could it be? Right. You have been quite slow on Open Talk lately, haven't you? That is because I have done a lot last month. It makes sense to get less this month. Maybe. See you! Hurry up! We're late. Boss, is the framing okay? Whoever is there, ask the little girl to move a bit to the left. Hey, lower down the light by a bit. Very good! Famous local director, Mumbai computer stunts Can you use special effects to add in ten goats drinking water? Don't worry, ten cows won't be a problem either. Good! Assistant director from Kuala Lumpur - Hi. - Hi. They are preparing for the rehearsal! Radio operator from Rangoon Are you crazy? Doing something like this in a crowd? No, we are preparing for the kissing scene. She asked me to cooperate. - You are rehearsing? - Yes! I would've turned down this job if I knew I had to kiss her. Don't say that. Mark. Sorry, we had a problem with the previous shot. - Please rest first. - All right, thank you! Mark, the production crew of your movie are mostly foreigners. Can they communicate with each other? Of course, what do you know? There are job vacancies that require the skills of foreign professionals. What is so strange about that? You are right. Regardless of language and race, the important thing is to work together as a team. Correct! So they are here to steal our jobs? How could you think this way? If you have your own unique skills and you are also a professional, there's no need to worry about that. You will still be in demand wherever you go, right? Yes, you're right! We can also secretly observe and learn from them. Learn secretly? No need for that. We openly learn from each other. Look. All of us have our own unique talents. Since when do you know so much? Actually, I don't know what I just said. Don't quote what you don't know. Mark, - we are ready to resume the shoot. - All done? Okay. Two of you continue rehearsing. - Again? - Okay! Let's go. Don't... Wait, I'll do my make up first. Hi, director! This scene is very important. Your wife has just left you because of your gambling habit. Your daughter misses her mother very much, and you are trying to comfort her. But she is not comforted and continues to cry. Okay, great. - Do you remember your lines? - Yes. Good! Okay, see you later. Well, where were we? Remember the lines... Ready and action! Did you catch the fish? Gosh, you didn't manage to catch it. Dad. I haven't seen Mom for a long time. Where did she go? Your mom went somewhere far away to work. She won't be coming back for a long time, okay? Do not lie to me. Does Mom not want us anymore? Cut! Girl... Remember? You have to cry after this line. - Cry, okay? - One more. Okay, one more time. - Come! - Camera rolling... - Action! - Dad. I haven't seen Mom for a long time. Where did she go? Your mom went somewhere far away to work. She will only be back later. Do not lie to me. Does Mom not want us anymore? Cut! Girl, you must cry, okay? Girl... Remember to cry! Take six! - Cut... - Take seven! - Cut! - Take 28! - Cut... - Take 31! Cut... Director. Let's rest for ten minutes, okay? Okay, let's take a break. Girl, go and rest. We will continue later. Hey, director. This is not going to work. Let's rub her eyes with medicated oil. Are you crazy? She is still a kid! Do we even use medicated oil nowadays? If not, then... - Hit her? - Of course not. Just pretend. Frighten her. A child will cry when she is scared. - Will it work? - We can try. All right, let's try. One more! Standby! Action! Cut. Let's shoot another day. Let's get a replacement. Let me introduce the sponsors of our program next week. Karen and Min Yi from the Ministry of Communications and Information. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello all. - Thank you for your support. The ministry has commissioned us to do promotional activities for PDPA. We will definitely try our best to do it well. Yes, we are discussing how to present this on our show, and Marcus suggested to do a radio drama. You came in at the right time. I don't know much about PDPA, so I don't know where to start. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I have shared some information with you before. I wonder how much you have understood from it? I know! PDPA stands for Personal Data Protection Act, which is the legislation governing personal data protection. It's very easy. It's your personal information like NRIC and mobile number. You shouldn't give them to just anyone. Yes, you should only provide it for legitimate or valid reasons. Otherwise, some people might abuse your personal information and send advertising messages to your mobile phones. No wonder I received text messages on product sales or discounts. Everyone likes free gifts and discounts. But if you don't want to receive such messages from unknown sources, you can register your phone number on the DNC list, which stands for Do Not Call Registry. Yes, which is to opt-out of receiving unsolicited marketing messages. I have a suggestion. You can consider using Q and A with prizes to let the listeners know more about PDPA. - That is a good idea. - We can attract listeners, and through Q and A, they can better understand the key points. I think it is a good idea to use Q and A for the campaign. Let's do it. - Okay. - Okay. - All right, thank you. - Thank you. - Okay. - Thank you. I will walk you out. Goodbye. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. We've just closed another deal. Now that the Internet is so developed, it's important to protect personal data and your personal privacy. Look at Mark. What are you talking about? What do I have to protect? You just had a fight with your wife and now the whole world knows. Did you install CCTV in my house? Mark. Who wants to see you? Do take some time to look at your wife's social media account. Mark, don't just focus on your own social network, you have to care more about your wife. You see, your wife has been married to you for ten years. Her face is yellow like a salted egg yolk fish skin. Lovers' quarrels are soon mended. If you are a real man, I think you should apologize to your wife first. Dennis! You clicked "Like" on her post? I saw her yellowish face and I thought it was a makeup effect. I will "Unlike" it. It's January. It's also my idol, Fann Wong's birthday month! I wonder what her love, Christopher, will plan for her birthday? From their photo posted on Instagram previously, - I can see that they're in bliss. - I was in meetings all day. I'm so tired. Dear, I'm sorry. I have apologized. What else do you want from me? See for yourself! Local heavenly king gets big-headed and slaps little girl. What does this mean? Now you have to apologize to a lot of people. Which idiot sabotaged me? How many times have I told you? Don't use foul language at home. Hello, good morning. This is The Radio Quartet. You can tell that Mark Lee is not a good person. Look at his face, he's so ugly. He claims to be a good father? Now, he has shown his true colors. He must be abusive at home too. Psycho! Mark, it doesn't help to be angry. But I did not strike that little girl! If I did, I would admit it. We need to urgently salvage your reputation, okay? But I didn't do a thing, why is there a need? The radio survey is coming soon. The radio station wants us to settle this. I didn't do a thing, what's there to settle? The radio station can settle all they want! You are not a newbie anymore. This is how show business works. We can't trace who posted this online. Otherwise, we can get this person to clarify. This is such a headache. Let's clarify! Call that little girl. We can ask her to clarify. Okay. It is too late. See for yourself. Ever since my daughter was slapped by Mark Lee, she has become dull-witted. I don't even bear to beat my own daughter. Now, she hides in the room all day. She even refuses to attend school. I took her to a psychiatrist. The doctor says it is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is all your fault, Mark Lee! You have destroyed my daughter's life. I want my cute and lovely daughter back! We always discuss the trending topic on our radio show. Recently, there's a piece of news that is causing quite a stir. The news that has caught many people's attention. It's the incident where Mark allegedly slapped a girl on a movie set. I think it's probably due to stress. Everyone has stress, but celebrities have to cope with more stress. At times, emotions will run high. Since we've started on this topic, why don't we let our listeners call in at 66911972 and share their views on how to differentiate between real and fake news. Hello, good morning. This is The Radio Quartet. Hello! Let me tell you, I've seen the video. It is definitely real, it is not fake news. And Marcus, I must say this. You said celebrities have a lot of stress. We also face plenty of stress at work. But does stress give us the right to kill? I tell you, my friend met Mark Lee in Bishan. He said Mark Lee was very arrogant. He smiled at Mark, but Mark pretended not to notice. Mark Lee has his nose stuck up in the air. You said that it was your friend who saw Mark Lee and not you, so it may not be true. Are you saying I'm lying? I didn't mean it that way. I'm saying that maybe Mark really didn't see your friend. You are both celebrities. Of course you will speak up for him. Celebrities are all fake. They are hypocrites! Marcus Chin, you're so old, so you should know better. Please have some conscience. Be reasonable! Who is unreasonable here... - Hey. - Sir, thank you for your valuable opinion. I'm sure Mark won't repeat the same mistake next time. Well then, let's listen to "Next Time No More" by Andy Lau. Biyu. Wasn't this song just played recently? - Was it? Really? - Yes. Marcus, you're packing up already? Where are you rushing to? Sorry, I have an important appointment. Bye! - Please have a seat. - Thank you. Mr. Chin, I'm sorry that you have to make a trip here. It's okay. I'm used to it. Your daughter was caught playing truant. Are we discussing why she played truant or that she was caught in the act? Is there a difference? Of course. Playing truant is a disciplinary issue. While getting caught is the lack of intelligence and technique. Anyway, she shouldn't play truant. Also, this is not her first time. Okay. Ms. Neo, let me ask you a question. Have you ever played truant? Me? Never. Are you sure? - I... - Have you ever feigned illness? You may not be really ill, but you took medical leave anyway to skip school. Isn't that counted as a truancy act too? - Actually... - Actually, it's part of growing up to play truant. It's a natural process. If they don't attend school, they won't play truant. If they've never played truant, then they've never attended school. Playing truant and attending school comes in a package. - But... - Stop. There's no but. The mistake that my daughter committed was not truancy. Her mistake was getting caught for truancy. Hey, you mean... It's okay for your daughter to play truant? See? You still don't get what I mean. Okay. As a teacher, have you ever thought about it before? Why does your student play truant? Is there a reason she wants to skip school? Of course! If your classes are engaging and you entertain your students well, will they still skip school? Do you get what I mean? Do you know what to do? So what should I do? Good question. You're the teacher, so you should know what to do. Let's go! Please give me two cupcakes, a cup of tea, and a glass of orange juice. Sure. Dad, if I didn't skip school today, you wouldn't have brought me out. Who told you that? I'm just very busy recently. Mom is also very fierce recently. I'm not allowed to do this, and I'm not allowed to do that. I'm not allowed to do everything. Dad, can I live with you instead? Does Mom really treat you that badly? Okay. When there's a chance, I will call your mom to scold her. Let's call her now. I have already put through the call. She's not picking up. Hello? Bin Bin! Why aren't you home yet? Home? We are having a feast. A feast? You have money to feast on and yet no money for the alimony? I feel embarrassed when I bring Bin Bin to the tuition center. I don't have money for her tuition fees. Excuse me! Be more reasonable, okay? Since when have I owed you money? Sometimes I'm late, but I've never owed you, okay? If you don't pay up the alimony, you'll receive my lawyer's letter! I dare you! Now, listen carefully. From now on, you have to give in to whatever my daughter wants. Let her do whatever she pleases. If you are strict with her again, I won't be so easy on you. - How? - Dad, you are my idol. Come, let's eat. - Hello? - Hello, Marcus. I'm sorry. The recording is changed to 4 p.m. as Wendy has to leave early. 4 p.m.? Okay. I will be back soon. Dad has to leave for work now. I'll book a taxi to send you home. So early? Good afternoon, welcome to Golden Age Talentime. - Be an Active Senior! - Be an Active Senior! Thank you! Able to provide every month's... Cut. It's "every day." Able to promote every... Cut. It's "provide." He has joined more than 500 singing competitions, crowned champion for 400 times, and 1st runner-up for 100 times. Let's welcome Henry Thia! My good child Always... Able to provide every year's... Cut. "Every year"? It's "every day." Why did you say every year? I know, I know... Able to provide you with nutritious eggs every day. Choose Seng Choon Eggs. Okay, cut! Jevi. Jevi! Yes, sir. Are you hungry? Do you want me to cook for you? It's okay. Go to bed. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Goodnight, sir. Sir, there is a letter on the table. Darn it! The lawyer is more efficient than a debt collector! This next song we're about to play is a song by Andy Lau, "It's Not a Sin for Men to Cry." Hey. Is Andy Lau the only singer in this world? I don't know. It's just a coincidence. Very strange, right? I just happen to play his song every time. But, Marcus, I think you resemble Andy Lau. I know. You mean my looks, right? Whatever that makes you happy. You dream on! I mean, like Andy, you are very driven. Did you know? Andy Lau mentioned this in one of his interviews. He is not an "iron man." There are times when he feels tired too. But he is happy because he is doing what he loves. I think that's what makes both of you similar. There are times when I'm tired too. But I know how to keep myself healthy. There is a saying in Cantonese that goes "If a lady neglects her health, she'll age fast. If a man neglects his health, he'll lose..." - What will he lose? - He will lose his po... Power. Gosh! What are you trying to say? One minute you are tired, and then you are full of life. Honestly, you are juggling many jobs, yet every morning when you are on the show, you are full of life. How do you do it? Why do you care? "Why do you care"? I will not care about you anymore. I'll talk to my listeners instead. Mr. Chen would like to inform everyone that there is heavy traffic on PIE towards Changi Airport. And heavy traffic as well on the Central Expressway towards the City. All right, if you have any latest updates on traffic, call 62558400. Drive safe, everyone. For today's weather, thundery showers can be expected islandwide until evening. The temperature is between 26 to 33 degrees Celsius. If you're heading out, bring an umbrella with you and don't catch a cold. After the weather report, I received Mr. Chen's text message. After the commercial break, we will play this love song dedicated by Mr. Chen to his girlfriend Sally for her birthday today. I will be playing "Meet Forever" by Rosamund Kwan and Andy Lau. Let us enjoy this beautiful song. Andy Lau is recovering well from his horse-riding accident. He is now set to kick off his concert tour! The fans can't wait! I wonder when he'll make his stop in Singapore. Boss, you were looking for me? Okay. I'm arranging for you to interview Andy... Andy Lau! How did you guess? He is here next week for his concert. Previously, I arranged for Mark to do the interview, but... I can go! Let me go for the interview. I knew I didn't pick the wrong person. But... I have already assigned you to interview Jay Chou. Are you sure there wouldn't be a problem? Well, even if there is, I will make sure it's no problem. No problem. - Really? Okay. - Yes. An interview with Andy Lau. Hey, we are back on-air in two minutes. Okay. Biyu! - What? - What is up with this outfit? What's so funny? Both of you have no fashion sense. There is a good reason for my outfit today. I'm going to interview Andy Lau. When Andy sees me in this outfit, it'll be as good as seeing his wife. That will put him at ease during the interview. He's at ease, but it makes me uneasy. That's your problem. Hey! Why are you dressed like Andy Lau? What's with the mask? If I knew you would dress like this, I wouldn't have worn this. It's so disgusting. Disgusting? You're so annoying! Okay, ten seconds countdown. We will be taking calls from our listeners. Okay. What's so funny? Stop laughing! Have you not seen me this pretty? Get ready to go on-air. Hello! Hello? Is this Dennis? - Hey! - I'm Daniel, do you remember me? Hi, Daniel. Nice to meet you. Who are you dedicating this song to? I just wanted to say that I really like you. Really? Thank you for your kind support. However, my friend always complains to me about you. She thinks you're not as funny now. Your friend has a good observation. Marcus Chin? I want to sue you. Hey. I'm not the one who is not funny, why are you suing me? That's the thing! Your jokes are too funny. I can't stop laughing. If I ever die from laughing too much, my mother will most definitely sue you. This listener has good taste! Don't say that. Anyway, Dennis. You must buck up. Otherwise, listeners will complain about your bad jokes. You can do it! All the best! Thank you. Hey, don't take his words to heart. You've been doing this for years. Shouldn't you know better? But he's not exactly wrong. I'm not deteriorating, but I've not improved too. Unlike you. You are getting more popular. You have more fans than before. I'm not sure if you've made any improvements, but I do know that your hair is not making any improvement. Your hair seems thinner. And you even have to backcomb your hair. What's wrong? Is it due to stress? You should go for hair treatment. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. -Marcus, -You're here, Adeline. I've brought you some bird's nest. You shouldn't have. Bird's nest is expensive. It's okay, my father bought it for you. He said you can act, can sing, and be a good DJ. It's hard to find talent like you. I also like to listen to 97.2FM. Your jokes are the funniest. - Dennis's jokes are not bad too. - Dennis? It's just all right. Marcus, remember to have the bird's nest. I'm heading off to school, goodbye! Goodbye, be safe. You haven't left? Remember to go for hair treatment. After the treatment, your jokes will be funny again. Jokes 101 Boss Hello, Boss? Dennis, come to my office tomorrow. That's about it. Dennis. Your listenership for Zhou Gong Ghost Tales is dropping. Why don't you take a break, relax a little, and do some research to get new ideas? Think of some new programs. Okay? Dennis. Dennis! What are you doing? Why do you seem so troubled? It's nothing, Biyu. It's Boss. She said the listenership for my programs has dropped drastically. There are even complaints that Zhou Gong Ghost Tales is not scary anymore. I just feel that more and more listeners dislike me. Well... Don't take it to heart. It's a radio program. Some people like it and some don't. I think that as long as you don't give up and keep working hard, the day will come when your haters become your fans. Who knows, maybe one day, all the listeners in Singapore will like you and you will become the most popular radio DJ. So, don't give up. Keep fighting. Okay? Don't dwell on what Boss said. I'm going to my meeting. Keep fighting! Why? Annoying! Frustrating! Why! Frustrating! Why? Why? Why? We are lonely when we are emotional And feel a little sentimental IMPERIAL CHICKEN Not a single soul? Are you not one? Have your coffee. Nobody is asking for your comment. I can't believe one slap can turn your life upside down. Let's not talk about it. When one is unlucky, you will even choke on saliva. But it's okay, your schedule was so packed in the past, you barely had time to rest. Take this as a break. Perhaps you can consider going behind the scenes. Focus on your movie. I would love to! But now, whenever my sponsors hear "Mark Lee," they will all run away. But luckily, Hong Kong star Chapman To is willing to be my movie's leading man. - Chapman To? - Yes. Are you kidding me? He is blacklisted. Nobody dares to work with him. You're already so down on luck, why find someone who has more bad luck than you? Double negative makes a positive? Right now, what you should do is find someone with luck. - Who? - Me! - You? - Yes! Chapman To is known in Taiwan and in Hong Kong. What about you? You are only well known in Sembawang and Hougang. - What's the point? - I know. But I have something that he doesn't. - What is that? - I'm cheap! You definitely win if that's how you compare. Am I right? But why are you so keen to star in my movie? I don't have a choice. My expenses are high each month. I have to pay 4,000 here and 2,000 there. I've to spend at least 6,000. You are really one of a kind. The market rate is 120 dollars per night and yours is 6,000 dollars per month. You only have yourself to blame. I disagree. My love is not based on each night. It's based on each year. That's why! You have to pay it in 12 months' installments. Anyway, let's not argue on this. Wing Fai has already said that we don't have a single sponsor. - Is the sponsor called Thomas? - So what? - He's my secondary schoolmate! - So? He used to copy my papers during exams. - So? - Count on me! Let me settle him! If I manage to, let me be the leading man! How's that? Okay! If you can close the deal, Chapman To is still the male lead, but you are the second lead. But for the sponsorship commission, I'll give you five percent. Ten percent. Okay, 20 percent! No problem! Do you need to slam this hard? Can you hear it? - Hear what? - The sound of cash. In the past, I could hear the sound of cash. There are never-ending jobs. Now you see. Not a single job. You are still in the mood to joke? What else can I do if I don't joke? Mark, the radio ads for The Radio Quartet are dropping. Yes. It could be because of your incident. What do you mean? You... Do you want to consider taking a break? If I stop being a radio DJ, I'm officially jobless, you know? And you still want me to take a break? Chapman, you're here? You are finally here. Mark, your office is very nice. - It's just okay. - And I've missed you! Me too. How's everything? Not too bad. But why are there many reporters hanging out downstairs? Am I so famous in Singapore? I'm sorry, the reporters are not here for you, but for me. Haven't you seen the video of me slapping a kid? Yes! I'm now very troubled by it. I find it entertaining! I even watch it repeatedly. My friend in South Africa saw it too. But I feel there's nothing wrong with hitting a kid. Some kids are annoying, they deserve to be smacked. The problem is I didn't hit her! Is that important? If someone says you did it on social media, it means you did. The pictures are proof. Forget it, let's not talk about this. Let's discuss our movie contract. I have prepared it. Mark, don't bother! We may be good friends, but it's still more proper to go through the terms. What I mean is... I can't do your movie anymore. I'm here to apologize to you. You are dropping out? You can't be, right? You are all so realistic? It's not me who is realistic. It's my manager. They don't want me to be involved. I'm very sincere. I bothered to fly in personally to apologize. If it was Jackie Chan, I doubt he would even bother. But I have been slandered. It's only now that you are slandered? I've been banned for years, but I'm still all right. It's okay, it's nothing unusual. Forget it. Return to your hotel. Since there's no shoot, why don't we go for black pepper crabs! - Give me a treat! - You've turned down my movie and you still expect a treat from me? Dinner is on me then! But there are reporters downstairs. How should I leave? This is only the ninth floor. You can jump down from here. From the ninth floor? It still beats letting the reporters know I'm friends with you. It shouldn't be a problem. He really jumped? Forget it. How is it? Do you feel comfortable? - Yes, it's comfortable. - But I've not started massaging. I'm just kidding. I tuned in to your radio show that day, the joke you said was entertaining. But I have heard it before on a Taiwanese show. Aren't I environmentally friendly? I mean... I recycle other people's jokes. You are really humorous. I don't know why, but I dropped a lot of hair recently. I'm worried that I might become bald soon. There are many reasons for hair loss. Don't worry, we will find the solution to your problem. By the way, you do look tired. I'm under a lot of stress lately. Stress causes hair loss. Rest assured, you just need to relax. Leave everything to me. I will prepare the hair steamer for you. It will only take ten minutes. I will spray the hair essence on your hair. This is very effective! However, remember not to... Number 0 and Number 8 met on the road. When Number 0 saw Number 8, it said, "Hey! Fatty, why are you wearing a belt?" This joke is very funny right? There is another one that is even better. Listen to this. There was a boy who had stomach problems. He went to see a doctor, he told the doctor, "Doctor, I don't know why, but I pooped out whatever I ate. When I ate prawns, I pooped out the prawns. When I ate meat, I pooped out the meat. When I ate vegetables, I pooped out the vegetables. Doctor, what should I do?" The doctor looked at him, and said, "It looks like you should eat poo." Isn't this funny? What do you guys want to drink? I will buy it. - Anything. - Anything. Drink whatever I get for you, okay? Thank you, Godfather. Dennis's godsons A, B, C Uncle Chor Meng, why is Godfather behaving so strangely lately? I felt it too. My laughter seemed fake. Was it too obvious? Me too. I don't know if he noticed it. You did this out of concern. He will understand. I'm worried about him. I suddenly feel tired. I'm on the morning shift tomorrow. I'd better head back early. Goodbye. Your product endorsement... The client will not be renewing the contract. This I already know, tell me something I don't. The movie company has decided to drop you from their two movies. For Body SOS, they say Lee Teng alone is enough. They don't need you anymore. As you can see, the company can't hold on much longer. We don't have a single job on hand. I don't even dare turn on the aircon now. Also, I would like to dissolve our partnership. Right now? I also don't wish to! You didn't want to or you've been planning to? Wing Fai, we have been friends for so long. Why are you doing this at this crucial moment? Mark, I'm getting married at the end of the year and need to care for my family. If this goes on, I will have financial problems. Hello? No, nothing. Okay, I'm coming over now. Jack! I'm sorry. - I was caught in a traffic jam. - It's okay. Are you doing okay? Well, if you are down on luck, even if you bought a cemetery, people would stop dying. You know, we live in a very bizarre world. On social media, people think that real news is fake. Fake news will spread and become real news. Whether it is real or fake, they dropped me from a movie. My endorsements got canceled. And Wing Fai wants to end his partnership with me. - Don't you find me pathetic? - Is he that kind of person? I didn't expect him to be either. Now, I can see his true colors. I told you, Wing Fai is not a good person. How about going back to J Team instead? You see, Jack is terrified. No, I'm not. Our company has more than enough talents. And we only hire young people nowadays. In fact, it is possible that the three of us can think of a solution. What kind of solution? How about this? You can make a public apology. A public apology? Why must I? Doesn't a public apology mean that I'm wrong? If I admit that I was wrong, the girl's mother would sue me. Won't I need to compensate her? Maybe you should just compensate her with a daughter! How? I had a vasectomy! Let me tell you. How about not doing anything? This is how social media works. If you don't bother about the news, it will slowly quieten down. Because news are out every day, no one cares about old news. - Right? - How can I do nothing? You see, one minute ago. This sickening person said this about me. "Mark Lee, you are no better than a beast!" Here's another one. This idiot said, "Mark Lee is inhuman!" This moron is the worst. "He is a dog, he should eat dog poo!" - Just don't bother about them! - You asked me not to bother? If they make me angry, I will definitely sue them! Mark, let me tell you. - Do you know what you should do? - What? Don't be bothered by them. How is that possible? I have done everything. I have tried everything. I have tried my best. Nothing worked! You asked me to give you advice, but you disagree with everything I say. Solve your own problems! I'm not free! - Jack. - Jack! What are you going to do now? Didn't you say you wanted to go back to J Team? That's right! Jack! Wait for me! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Henry! Henry! When you are down, no one will stand by your side. Thank you. I never expected Thomas's daughter to be such a beauty. And with such a good figure and attractiveness. What a gorgeous lady! I hear this very often. I'm very used to it. That's right! My dad has mentioned it to me. You can talk to me directly. I'm here to discuss the proposal to sponsor King Kong's upcoming movie. I see... Honestly... Mark Lee's name is already condemned on social media. The video has gone viral, so if I still have any association with him, I would rather throw my money into the sea. Please listen to me. I know Mark very well. I can vouch for him. Mark will never do such a thing. Of course I believe you. Think about it, Mark has been in the show business for so many years. From acting as a trash bin to the local heavenly king. Will one or two negative news knock him down? - Am I right? - I'm listening. Besides, people are forgetful. What if during Faye Wong's concert tomorrow, Faye Wong suffers a wardrobe malfunction? This news will cover up the Mark's news. Besides, negative news is also very good for publicity. It makes sense. Okay. Please drop by my office someday to discuss the details. Thank you! Come. - Cheers! - Cheers! By the way, Mr. Marcus. I grew up watching your show. I really like your jokes. Jokes? Actually, my expertise is that I can tell the size she's wearing by looking at a woman's hip. Really? Everybody! Mr. Marcus wants to perform something special! - Really? - Really? S size! Impressive! M size! Awesome! S size! Gosh! Incredible! X-X-L size! It's not accurate at all! Marcus, you have been on the phone since morning. Who are you calling? I'm calling the investor for Mark's movie. Last night, I got carried away and offended her. And now, she's not willing to answer my calls. Well... Isn't it more sincere to apologize personally, rather than calling her? Excuse me, I have an appointment with Samantha. Please come with me. Thank you. Please have a seat. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Hi! Samantha. Have a seat. What can I do for you today? I'm so sorry for being rude last night. I'm here to apologize. Rude? Were you? I'm not a good drinker, I got carried away. I'm sorry. You are referring to that? I have forgotten about it. Your special power is quite remarkable, isn't it? Just one look and you know that my size is XXXL. No. I was drunk that day. I have small eyes, so I got it wrong. I saw three extra "X." In fact, you are so slim, it should be only size L. L. I'm very busy, so please see yourself out. Thanks for your kind thoughts, but I decline with thanks. Please take it away. Girl, I've brewed some pork rib soup for you. Mom, I have told you many times. Please call me by my name in the office. You have a guest... Marcus Chin! I really like to hear you sing. I have attended all your concerts. I have watched every episode of Golden Age Talentime. If you're not the host for that episode, then I won't watch it. You are very humorous. Thank you. Are you her mother? Yes. I thought you were her sister! I believe you must have taken after your father. Is that so? By the way, why are you meeting my daughter? I'm here to invite Samantha to invest in a movie that I'm starring in. You have a new movie? Of course we will support! Mom... But... She has rejected me. Isn't your dad very supportive of local movies? - Mom, you don't understand. - Well... It doesn't take a lot of money to make a movie. You can invest two million just for the fun of it. Mom, that's not how you do business. How hard will it be? Invest two million, and you'll make money when the box office hits 5 or 6 million! He is my idol. If you reject, you will make me look bad. Samantha, I really hope that you can invest in this movie to support me. All right! Thank you! Well, okay. I will think about it. Thank you! Calista, don't complain that we only drive out for family outings. Today, Dad is going to take the train with you. You can take as many rides as you like. Let's go! Let's have ice cream. Okay! Dad... You see. Don't you think the bag is suspicious? Someone could have left it there and forgotten about it. He will come back for it later. Let's go! But my teacher says, if we see any suspicious bag, we must report it to the police. Report to the police? This is the responsibility of good citizens. Good citizens? Please wait for me! Good citizens... Done. Dad, why are you taking a photo with the bag? As your teacher mentioned, we must be good citizens. Your dad is the local heavenly king. I have the responsibility to let the public know that if they come across any suspicious bag, they must be alert. Wait. "What is inside the bag? Make a guess. Or report it to the police and let them handle it?" I'm so smart! Done! I might have saved everyone at the MRT station with this post. I will become the National Hero! Next year's National Day, I can sing the National Day song! Come! This is bomb Maybe We all must carefully... Mom! Yes? Dad is cooking abalone noodles. Why is that so? I don't know. It's ready! Be careful! It's very hot! Abalone Noodles This is for your mom. This is for you, Calista. This is mine. And there are really abalones in the pack! Why are you in such a good mood today? The photo that I uploaded might make me the National Hero. Then my career will be revived! Who could it be? - Yes? - Are you Mr. Lee? - Yes. - We are from the police department. Mr. Lee, you posted this photo on your Instagram this morning. Yes. To inform the public if they see a suspicious bag left unattended, they should report it to the police. Sir, is this considered wrong? Please take a closer look at the caption. "Bomb in Orchard Road." "Run for your life!" But, Sir, I didn't write this caption. And this is also not posted by me. This one too? "Bomb at Orchard MRT." "Many died. More injured." This is the worst, it's really too much. This is my photo, but this is not what I wrote. See how scary fake news can be? Actually... You know, that wasn't my intention. If I knew that things would become so serious, I would definitely not do this. Mr. Lee, we hope that if you come across a similar situation of seeing a suspicious item... I will call 999. I won't take a picture and post it on the Internet. - Correct? - Good. Otherwise, you will create a public alarm. Anyway, it appears that you do not have any malicious intent. Unfortunately, your kind intention was misused by other people. Okay. Anyway, next time... Whenever I see anything... Everything... I... I will call the police. Alternatively, you can also report it to the SGSecure App. Yes, of course. - Dr. Lee. - Yes. In today's world, news goes viral easily. Since Mark Lee is a public figure, shouldn't he have given more consideration before his actions? You're right. In today's world where news is spread easily, as a public figure, he should have considered more before acting on anything. Dr. Lee. The public's perception of Mark Lee is already not good. Is it possible that his actions, regardless of intentions, is likely to be perceived differently and misunderstood? You're right. Because the public's perception of him is not good. His actions, even if they are of good intentions, will likely be read differently and misunderstood. Doctor, we would like to ask. Mark was previously caught in a controversial situation. So instead of posting the photo online, should he have reported it to the relevant authorities instead? Yes. Mark was previously embroiled in a controversial incident, so he shouldn't have posted his photo online, and should have reported it to the relevant authorities instead. Any other questions? Are his actions redundant? Did he bring about his own problems? His actions are kind of redundant and only brought about problems to himself. Mark Lee has totally lost his mind. How could he do something so moronic? He's such a joke! Please, those with some sense know this is a movie promotion! If you sympathize with him, then you've been fooled. Please don't be so stupid! If he was not a celebrity, he would have been charged in court. So I think celebrities are given special privileges. I strongly urge the police to conduct an investigation! The recent case of him slapping a girl has just died down. He is again the hot topic. I really don't know what to say. One problem after another. I'm not sure if he can cope with it. - Hi. - Hi. Your dad is very famous now! My dad has always been famous. But he is famous because he is stupid! You're not allowed to say my dad is stupid! My dad and mom told me, the most stupid person in Singapore is your dad. - Stop laughing! - When I saw your dad on television, I used to think he's very smart. It turns out that this is all fake! He doesn't know what's a real and fake bomb, so dumb! All of your dads are dumb! - What's wrong? - Where are you going? Gosh, Calista. Is your mom in a good mood today? She let you watch television shows? Calista? What's wrong? It's nothing. Why does Calista look so unhappy? She locked herself in the room when she came back. I got a call from the teacher. She said that Calista argued with her classmates because of you. How dare they bully my daughter? I'll talk to them tomorrow! Don't you have other things to do? Do you not have enough trouble already? You should think about how to cheer her up first. That's easy. Calista. Come. Calista, magic! See? See. Egg. See? Can you see that? The egg yolk is rolling around in my hand. Can you see that? It rolls around easily. You see, it will not break. Also, I can pick it up with my fingers! Magic! Dad, this is not magic. We can pick up the egg yolks like this because these are good-quality eggs. Calista, Mom and Dad were also bullied in school. So don't be sad, okay? Yes, don't be sad, okay? Dad... I'm not sad because my classmates make fun of me. I'm sad because many people scold you. You don't know how to do this simple spelling? Why are you so stupid? Your test scores are so bad! Stop crying! Are you here to apologize? And also to tell you that my company is producing a movie about children. Will your daughter be interested? Come in. That's so sweet of you. - What would you like to drink? - No, I don't need any. You said you planned to shoot a movie about children? What role can my daughter play? She will play the lead role. - Really? - Why would I lie to you? Next week is the press conference. If you aren't keen, let me know earlier. Of course we are keen. My daughter will definitely seize this opportunity. But on one condition. Even if it is ten conditions, I will also agree. You cannot call her stupid anymore. Sure. No problem. Lead actress. PDPA is the Personal Data Protection Act, which includes your name, NRIC number, and mobile number. Personal Data Protection Act... There was a young man who was shopping for a new mobile phone. He bargained with the pretty salesgirl for a long time, and finally bought it. Before he left the shop, he felt shortchanged. He asked the salesgirl. "Hey pretty, is there a free gift for this handphone?" The salesgirl answered, "I will gift you a lift to the door!" The Lady White Snake farted, Xu Xian had a revelation. He said, "My dear wife, so you are a rattlesnake." This is not funny... A fat guy and a slim guy met on the street. The fat guy told the slim guy, "Hey! You are way too slim, you look like you just went through a famine!" Then the slim guy said to the fat guy, "The moment I saw you, I knew the famine was caused by you!" This is not even a joke! So fast! Andy, see you later! Dear, good luck for your press conference. Dad, good luck! Okay. Okay, I got to go. - Bye. - Bye. Samantha? Samantha. Good morning. You mean you are interested to invest? You want your mother and I to... Okay. I will be there soon. Hello? -Dennis, -Hello, Marcus. I need to take urgent leave today. Marcus, Biyu is not coming today. I'm sure you would do well on your own. Marcus, there is the PDPA project today. I have to read the messages from the listeners, I have to report news, and the open talk... I'm running out of time. I'm going to be late. It's decided. Marcus! You... What? No, nothing. Time is running out. There are so many things to do. I thought of a funny joke last night, but I've completely forgotten. Don't panic, take your time. Where is Marcus? - Isn't he on duty with you today? - He can't come in today. I'm going to be on air alone. I'm afraid that I can't cope. What should I do? Are you okay? Do you want me to inform Boss? Please don't! I'm okay. Really. Okay. I'm okay, really. Love 97.2FM The mother and her daughter are not here yet? The reporters will be here soon. Hello, Lina? What happened? Dennis should be fine. Did you tell Boss? I'm at a press conference. If it ends early, I will rush over. Okay. Okay, goodbye. I'm sorry, we are a little late. It's really "a little." This is our press conference, of course we take time to dress up. Are you confident that the film will happen? Rest assured. I don't mess with my career. If I manage to salvage my reputation, the movie will proceed as planned. That's good. Wing Fai, please get ready. Hi! Game is going to play with you later. Game playing with you? I'm going to play a game with you later. The game is about PAPA... PDPA! I have practiced many times at home. It's a Q and A on PDPA. Let's play the game after the commercial break. What's wrong with you, Dennis Chew? You can't even say a sentence properly. This is not your first time on duty alone. They must be badmouthing me again. Marcus, they are all my friends. I have told you all, I know Marcus Chin. You are awesome. Marcus, let's have breakfast. This... There's no hurry. Let's eat first. Here, have this mushroom bun. Thank you. Marcus Chin, please sing us a song. Haven't you heard him sing before? Don't you guys know? He is a well-known tenor. Then please sing some high notes. Okay. Okay. What? That's it? Can you go a little higher? Yes, please. Sure. - Hi ma'am, you are still on duty? - Hi Lina, you are early today. Yes, I'm here for voice recording. - I love listening to 97.2FM. - Thank you. - Have you eaten? - Not yet. I will go later. They must be badmouthing me again. My idol... We are going to meet soon. Why is the traffic so bad today? Sir, do you know what caused the traffic jam? It's the morning rush hour. This road has traffic jams every day. We've paid so much for ERP, but still there is traffic jam. Don't you know, Biyu? You... How do you know my name? I listen to 97.2FM every day. I'm very familiar with your voice! Thank you. Hi, nice to meet you. Before we start the game, let me tell you a joke. Are you ready? - Dennis is telling a joke. - Yes. Do you know why data protection needs to be protected? Because it is afraid of people "hitting it." Think about it, D-A-T-A in Chinese pinyin means "hitting it." Data, "hitting it." Data, "hitting it." That's why it needs protection. Best joke of 2018! Why is Dennis talking so strangely? What happened to Dennis? Nowadays, when I hear his jokes, I don't even need to turn on the air conditioner. It's so lame, it's cold! I think he is getting worse. Mark Lee's New Movie Conference AH GIRL TO BOY What's going on? Isn't it supposed to be an apology conference? Why is it a movie conference? Right. Hello, our friends from the media. Welcome to the movie conference of King Kong. Excuse me, your press release states that this is an apology conference? Correct, why has it become a movie conference? That's right. Recently, some unpleasant things happened. Mark has never had the opportunity to explain to the media. Hello? Biyu, what happened? Have you noticed that Dennis is acting weird today? I know, Lina called me just now. So Lina told you? Okay. Let's welcome our star for today, - I will call you back later. - Mark Lee. Okay, that's all, bye. What happened to Dennis? How did he end up like this? First of all, welcome to today's press conference. Also, I would like to take this opportunity to make an apology. Earlier on, the incident during filming has caused some misunderstanding. Perhaps to my supporters, those who have been following me for years, 97.2FM listeners, and even some Malaysian supporters, my behavior has set a bad example. I'm here to apologize to everyone. As for the little girl, this matter must have caused some disruptions to her life and her family. So, I've invited them to join me here today. I would like to apologize to them today. Let's welcome them on stage, okay? Come. In the presence of all the media, I apologize to them officially. - Hello, how are you? - Hello? How are you? May I know who's on the line? I'm Yan Loon Tan. Yan Loon. Okay, let's start the game. Dennis, you were saying your joke is the best joke of 2018? Gosh, it's really bad! If the joke is not that bad, it wouldn't have left an impression on you, right? All right, whatever pleases you. Okay. Let me ask you the question. Please tell me one way to protect one's personal data. Well, that's easy! If you join a lucky draw or contest, you must clearly understand the terms and conditions and don't freely provide your personal information in the contest form such as your mobile number. Sorry, can you please say that again? Is repeating the answer part of your game's requirement? Okay. If you join any lucky draw, you must understand clearly the terms and conditions and don't freely provide your personal information in the contest form such as your mobile number. Okay? Congratulations! That's correct! Please don't hang up yet, we need your personal particulars. Next up, let me play you this song. Okay, please tell me your name. Didn't I tell you? My name is Yan Loon Tan. Okay, how to spell it? Y-A-N L-O-O-N T-A-N Okay, Yan Loon, please give me your mobile number. What number? Please don't think that you are very witty, okay? Your mobile number. You're so funny! I don't even understand the terms and conditions of your game, now you are asking me for my mobile number? Are you not contradicting yourself? - You are full of crap! - Can you keep your mouth shut? If you don't provide your mobile number, how do we inform you about the prize collection details? What? You asked me to shut up? You better make it clear! What do you mean by shut up? Lina, carry on with your work. Why are you messing around here? Last warning, Mr. Tan Yan Loon! Your mobile number! Dennis! You forgot to turn off the microphone! Do you think that I'm afraid of you? I'm a listener, you are a radio DJ! What you've just heard is just a prank. Let's have the... Non-stop Favorite Karaoke Songs. Excuse me, I can't wait any longer. I have to get off here. You can't get off here! Boss Marcus, can the pitch go higher? Please, a little higher. Go higher. Okay. Higher. Marcus, can the pitch go higher? A little higher. Sorry. I have a call to pick up. I need to go out for a while. Wait a minute! Come back soon! We want you to pitch higher notes! Hello? Boss, what's up? How did it happen? I... Okay. I'll be back soon! I was ignorant and posted a photo on social media, the photo about a suspected bomb. It has caused some public unrest. I want to say sorry to everyone. And because of this matter, my daughter was teased by her classmates in school. The same goes for my wife. She also suffered from this. So... I hope that the media could lend me a helping hand to write "Wife, I'm sorry," okay? Otherwise, my life will be in danger when I'm home. Thank you. Okay, now let's talk about the latest project of King Kong Media Production, that is the new movie. The title of the movie is Ah Girl To Boy. Why is the title Ah Girl To Boy? I think you may ask Wing Fai. Ask him. He knows everything. When the filming will start and who are the casts. - Hey! - Hello? Christopher? - Can you bring Fann to 97.2FM? - Hey! How is it? - How is Dennis? - I don't know too. I thought there was something strange about him. I wanted to inform you, but he has lost control! Let's see how he is. Why are you all here? Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm good. Would you like to go downstairs for a chat? I said I'm fine. What's there to talk about? It's okay. Then why are you sitting here? Well... I'm thinking of a joke. A very funny joke for my listeners. Please let me be alone. Okay? Please? - Dennis! - Dennis! What happened? Dennis, don't put too much pressure on yourself. Why did you scold our listeners? Yes... If there's any problem, you should let us know. We'll help you out and try to think of a way to solve it. Yes. If your joke is not funny, you can work harder and practice more. There will be improvements. Marcus, of course you think it's easy, everyone says that your jokes are the best. I also copied my jokes from the Internet and books. It's nothing terrific. Dennis, relax! My idol! Dennis... don't give yourself so much pressure. People will always encounter bottlenecks in life, we need to learn how to relieve stress. Yes. When I was dating her, I also faced a lot of pressure. I even had second thoughts about marrying her. But later, I worked hard by filming more productions overseas, at the very least, I'm more well-known than her. If you think you can, you can! Do not forget the song by Andy Lau "The Path Winds Through High Peaks." Dennis, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Yes, Dennis. The Radio Quartet. Without you, it is incomplete. For so many years, our paths have never crossed. Samantha! Doctor, I think I'm suffering from depression. I don't know why. Every night, I just can't sleep. Also, my emotions will suddenly become erratic. Sometimes it's high, sometimes it's low, sometimes I feel happy, and sometimes I feel like crying. Based on what you've said, you are suffering from depression. Because you can't sleep at night, your emotions will become erratic. Sometimes it's high, sometimes it's low, sometimes I feel happy, and sometimes I feel like crying. Am I right? I'm prone to fatigue, and my memory has also deteriorated. Is it because I don't have enough rest? Yes. According to what you said, you feel tired easily, your memory has also deteriorated. This is probably due to your lack of rest. Then should I relax and take a vacation? My advice to you is, relax and go on a vacation right away. Boss, is there anything else to pack? If I say "memories and lessons," will it make me sound like a scholar? Boss, don't scare me. I will take this as a valuable lesson. You didn't do it on purpose. It doesn't help if only you know the truth and the rest of the world doesn't. Anyway, I just feel guilty and sorry for my wife and daughter. Now, I have even lost my company. Perhaps you can publish a book. - A book? - Yes. On how to tell the difference between real and fake news, and which news sources are reliable and which news sources are unreliable. You have gone through it all, you can teach them how to tell fake news apart from real news. There will be many people interested. If the book becomes a bestseller, everything will be okay, right? You are usually very quiet, but now you talk so much. I think you are being sarcastic. No, I'm serious. Who would believe what a fool says? Everyone! Not everyone. It's Everyone Advertising Agency. Are you also mocking me? This is not the best time for any advertising agency to use me. Anyway, I have signed the document. From now on, we will go our separate ways. I wish you a prosperous business. I'm not bluffing you. I'm serious. I have just received news that Everyone Advertising Agency plans to cast you in their video. Received news? Could it be fake news? Fake news almost destroyed me. Have you checked with the ad agency? Do they have any malicious intentions? Why do they want to spread such fake news? Anyway, I'm the one with more experience. Don't bother me. No, I have checked on it. It's because of your issues with fake news that they want you in their video, to educate the public on how to deal with fake news. Did you two just gang up? No, I wasn't told anything! I've such bad reputation now, who will cast me? After the press conference, the little girl spoke up for you. Hey! You haven't announced the female lead yet! Girl, come. Tell everyone, how did Mr. Mark slapped you? - Come, faster. Say it! - Mr. Mark did not hit me! Why do you want me to tell lies? Your video is making people think that I'm sick! I don't like acting. Why are you forcing me? Why? Why? You will get it from me when you get home! Help! This video has over one million views! I did not expect this little girl to be my savior. I heard that after she got home, her mother beat her up very badly. Poor girl... Anyway, because of this video, the advertising agency was touched by the girl. So they decided to ask the four of you, to play the roles of victims of fake news. I thought someone wanted to break the partnership with me? Mark, I'm getting married at the end of the year. - Don't joke with me. - Wing Fai, you are the one who is getting married, not me. I'm not joking with you. Let me think about it. Put my things back. Dear listeners, good morning! - This is The Radio Quartet! - The Radio Quartet! Good morning, this is Biyu. Good morning, this is Marcus. Good morning, this is Mark. Good morning! This is Dennis. Hey, Dennis. Are you feeling better? Have you taken your medicine? I just had, and I'm really a good friend. - What do you mean? - Because I left some for you. Thank you! Don't forget about me! If it is a birth control pill... Then only one person can provide you. That is our sister, Biyu. What has this to do with me? Birth control pill? Are you kidding me? Biyu sounds like "contraception." Biyu, "contraception." Your Mandarin has improved a lot. - Thank you. - You are so silly! Okay! Here's the traffic report. Smooth traffic on Jurong Town Hall Road towards Changi Airport. - Thank you, Mr. Lee, for the information. - Okay. Thank you! We would like to share with you today on how to sit back, relax, and enjoy life! Marcus sure knows how to enjoy life. You love going on cruises. You are wrong. What I enjoy most is going to bed. But the beds on cruises are better! They are comfortable. Looks like we should go on a cruise soon! - Good idea! - I'm sorry. I can't join you guys. But Mark, why not? Because I'm busy preparing for a new movie. What movie? The movie title is The Radio Quartet! We will be in the movie! We are the main cast! Of course we are in it. We are The Radio Quartet! It can't be anyone else! I'm sorry, but the investors don't think you have regional appeal. And I feel bad telling you this. What do you mean? You can't be playing every character. No, I will be playing myself. We will cast other actors for your roles. We have yet to decide on the cast. Do you have any good suggestions? How about Biyu? - To play me? - Yes! I think Zoe Tay fits the role of Biyu. Zoe Tay to play Biyu? That's a good idea. Zoe Tay? - It's okay. - What do you mean "It's okay"? It's Zoe Tay! Do you even have the right to consider? How about you, Dennis? I think... There's only one actor who bears a close resemblance to me. - Who? - Aaron Kwok! He is having a relapse. - Correct! - Marcus, don't you mock me. Marcus, who do you think can play you? In the entire Asian movie industry, only one person can replace me. Who is it? Andy Lau. See! The one who is really sick is him! I agree. I think I should get off work early today. I'm not coming tomorrow. Today will be my last day. - Let's listen to a song now! - Sure. A song by The Radio Quartet, "Make It Big Big" movie theme song? - What? - What? - Amazing right? - So fast? You are awesome! - Of course! - It's our movie then!
