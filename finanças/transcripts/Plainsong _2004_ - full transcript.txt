Captioning sponsored by hallmark cards and CBS Ike? Come on now, get up. Get up. You, too, Bobby. No one's looking to read yesterday's news, guys. Aren't you eating with US? Can't. I have to get to school early. Why? Well, I have to talk to the principal about a student. What'd he do? You catch him cheating? Cheating is the least of his problems. Drink your juice. Isn't mom coming down today? I can't say what she'll do. Can I get you something? Ella? You want coffee? Will you help me later? I'd like to do it this evening. What is the matter with you? Did you go out drinking last night? Huh? No, mama, just go back to bed. Well, what is it, then? Victoria? Nothing. Nothing! I am on to you, little miss. On to what? You've got a baby in you, and that's what's making you puke. Isn't that what's going on here? Isn't it? Hmm? How many times did I warn you? Now look at you. Look it here at what's happened. I told you, didn't I?! Yeah, mama, you told me a lot of things. Don't you get smart with me. Then help me, mama, 'cause I need you to help me. It is too late for that. You got yourself into this, you can get yourself out. You don't want to listen to what I have to say? You can follow your father right out that door, 'cause I will not have you living in this house. Not like this. You don't mean that. Just see if I don't. You just try me, miss. Mother? Did you already deliver your papers? Mm-hmm. What time is it? Quarter to 8:00. Well, you better go. You don't want to be late. Wait. Can I have a kiss first? I hope you feel better, mom. Why'd you have to say that? Woman: All right, Mrs. Leslie, I get it. Let me see if I can have him get right back to you. She sure will. You betcha. Bye now. Save me. What? What was that about? Angry mother. She saw the school play last night, and she's all bent out of shape over Lindy rayburn singing in public, wearing what looks like a black slip. Oh! Maybe I should go see this play. Is he free? I have an appointment. Judy, can I borrow your copy machine? Oh, it's all yours. Mm... What's wrong? You look kind of stuck in the spin cycle. Your boys okay? They're fine. Ella? She's fine. He's wrapping it up. Look, if-if he wants to reschedule... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Thank you. I see here that you're failing Russell Beckman first semester. Tom, everybody knows Mr. Beckman isn't any kind of student. Well, unless he gets struck by lightning, he never will be, but he's got to have history to graduate. Well, maybe he won't. Now, Tom, right there we got a problem. Go a little easy on this kid, would you? What? You want him back here next year? I-I don't want him here this year, but somebody better tell him that he better do the work. You do me a favor, Tom. You scare the boy, but don't fail him. Vicky. You're here early. Everything okay? Hi. Hey, there, miss Vicky. They're wanting some of them pots pretty quick. So, uh, you need some help tying that apron? Not from you. What would you like me to tell the boys? Well... well, tell them they can come and visit whenever they want. You're not going to make that a problem, will you? Thank you. Mama! Open up! Mama? Would you please open up? Mama! Don't do this! Don't do this, ma... You're not going anywhere, pops. Just someone at the door. I'll answer it. Put your cap away and get back into bed. Go on. Hi. Thanks. Can you tell me who it is? A boy. Ah, I kind of figured that. Does he have a name? I don't really want to say. I mean, he doesn't want it. Well, he at least ought to take some responsibility. Does this boy live here in town? Is he in your class? You don't know him, miss Jonas. We met last summer, and we went out for a while. And at first, I thought that... I don't know what I thought, but he seemed nice. Why don't we finish talking tomorrow? Are you sure it's okay for me to stay? Yeah, it's fine. Well, for now. My father lives here, too, and-and I'm not sure he'll understand this. It'll work out. So, what do you two boys want? Collecting for the paper. It's $2.50. Is that so? Well, I don't think I'm going to pay you, so what do you think of that? Who cuts your hair these days? Our mother. I thought your mother moved out. I heard she moved into that rental house over on 3rd street last week. Just give them the money, Harvey. I'm making a point. See, I get my papers from you, you get your hair cut by me. It's called commerce. Well? What do you say when a man pays his bill? Thank you. Maybe you need to remind your mom that I went to school for this. It's not a hobby. Why does he always... He's a silly old dog bone who probably flunked barber school. That's why. Listen, you're going to let me do all the talking on this one, you hear? Who is it? We're collecting for the paper, ma'am. You might as well come in. Don't touch anything. And sit, sit over there. We can't stay, ma'am. Oh, hush. You got a whole lifetime ahead of you. Sit. All right. Start talking. It's $2.50. That is not talk, that is business. What are you learning in school? You both go to school don't you? Why don't you speak, hmm? What's your name? Bobby. Bobby. Who's your teacher? Mrs. Kean. Kean. Yeah, kean, big, tall woman with a long jaw? Is she a good teacher? Yeah, but one time she told a girl to shut up. Did she? What for? She didn't want to sit next to Ricky Peterson. She said he smelled like a cow pie. He probably does. His folks own a dairy, don't they? What about you? Who's your teacher? Miss carpenter. I don't know her. She's got long blonde hair and she always wears sweaters. What do you know about sweaters? You're too young to be thinking about women and sweaters. Don't you two boys ever smoke. You hear me? But you do. That's why i'm telling you. You don't want to end up like me, do you? An old woman, living by herself above a barber shop. I'll never be an old woman. Lucky you. Hand me my handbag, will you? Thank you. What happened to your family? I'm all that's left of it. Our mother doesn't live with US anymore. Shut up, Bobby. That's nobody's business. That's all right. I'm not going to tell nobody. Who could I tell anyway? Hmm? Ms. Jonas, isn't there a woman doctor I could go to? Not here, honey. Not in this town. Well, maybe we can go to another town. Victoria, sweetie, listen to me. You're here now. This is where you are. Come here. You don't to be careless.Wan t this is too important. Ho! Well? Yeah, she got one. It's about time. Bobby: Is that them? Tom: Yep. What was he doing to that cow? They're just checking to see if she's got a calf. Are we going to have to do that? Yep. Come on. I promised to help these guys, let's go. I see you brought a whole team. Yeah, well, they wanted to come. Ike, Bobby, come over here. This is Harold mcpheron. That there is his brother Raymond. Raymond: How much these workers going to set US back? Well, I don't know what they'll charge. You'll just have to ask them. Come on, boys. You boys go in there. You want to keep an eye out on that big red one. Why? What's wrong with her? Nothing. But it looks like she already chewed off her own tail, and she'd be happy to start on yours. Yah. Yah. Yah! Go on. Go on, move it. Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Okay, boys. That's enough. Well, it looks to me like this baby wants to arrive in may. I expect you'll have various kinds of trouble. In some ways, your body's not ready. On the other hand, you do seem strong. Do you want to keep this baby, Victoria? Have you thought about what it'll mean, having this kind of responsibility at your age? I do. I... want it. I want it. Harold, that isn't necessary. Stay out of this. You boys did a fine job. You come back again anytime. You hear? Dad. Yeah? He gave US $10 each. You think we should give it back? No. I think that'd be an insult. I'm guessing they enjoyed having you here. Do they live out here all alone? They do. How come? They always have. They lost their folks when they were pretty young. Why didn't they ever get married and have a family like everyone else? I don't know. People don't sometimes. Maybe they didn't want to leave each other. Maybe so. Girl: During the Indian removal, over 90 tribes were taken from their lands in the east. When the cherokees were asked to move, they went to the supreme court and asked for help. But president Andrews didn't care what the court said... Tom: President Andrew Jackson. Go on. Um... president Andrew Jackson didn't care what the court said, so the cherokees had to move to Tennessee. I'm done. Do you have anything about the black hawk war, the seminole's reaction? I wrote two pages. Congratulations. Sit down. Can somebody tell me why president Andrew Jackson felt that the bank of u.S. Only benefited the rich and powerful? Who did I ask to research that question? Victoria? Victoria? Wasn't it you? Yeah. All right, enough of that. The bank crisis of 1819. All right, Victoria, can you start again and speak in a loud and clear voice? Shh. What just happened? What did you say Russell? I, uh... I didn't say nothing. Charlene, go see what's wrong. Mr. Beckman. In the hall, now. Look, I didn't say nothing, okay? You said something. In the hall. You're already in serious trouble, and if you think i'm going to pass you... Ask me if I care. Oh, you will buster, you will. No, I won't. You don't know a thing about me, so why don't you get out of my face. Wait, hold it. She's not in the bathroom, Mr. Guthrie. I looked ev... You're bleeding. Tom? He's bleeding. Tom, are you okay? Uh... Think you need stitches? It looks a lot worse than it is. Your dinner is getting cold. Didn't mom say when she's coming back? Did she hit you? What? Is that why she's not coming back? Ike, this has nothing to do with your mother. This here happened because I had words with a student. Okay? What did you do to him? Well, we don't need to go into that now. Did they put him in jail? Well, I have no doubt that's in his future. Right now, he's suspended for the week. That's the whole story. There's nothing more to report. Can we eat? I'm not hungry. Ike? Hello, mother. Is something wrong? No. We just wanted to see you. Come on. I wasn't expecting anyone. Did your father send you here? No. He doesn't even know we came. How is he? Dad? He's okay. Does he ask about me? We talk about you. What do you say? We say we miss you, we wonder how you are. When do you think you'll be coming home? I can't say about that. He mustn't rush me. I need time. We brought you something. What are those? They're for you. Open them. Wow. You're supposed to drop those in the tub. Those are from me. The perfume's from... Let her open it first. If you don't like them, we can return them. No. I like them. I like them very much. Come here. Come here. Thank you. Hey, there. Hey. I understand you're meeting with Beckman's parents on Thursday? Oh, that's crowder's meeting. I'm only showing up as evidence. Well, if you need any support, I can furnish a long list of reasons why that kid should be permanently suspended. I think my face says it all. But thank you. You have a hard time letting anyone help you out, don't you, Mr. Guthrie? Look, I may be stepping out of bounds here. It's really none of my business, but... When my marriage fell apart, I didn't have a whole lot of people to talk to. A whole lot of folks around here were offering to help, but all they really wanted to do was take sides. I just needed someone to listen. Okay. What are you doing in this house? I'm staying with you, Mr. Jackson. Remember? Good night. Who said you could just come in here? You get out, or I'll call the police. Mr. Jackson, your daughter invited me here. That's a filthy lie. You're a thief. And you've no business in here. You hear me? Dad? You get out of here. Dad, what are you doing? She wants my bank key, that's what she wants. Dad, calm down. This is Victoria. I can't take much more of this. Dad, it's okay. Let's get you to bed. It's Victoria. You met her this morning. Did he hurt you? I'm fine. But miss Jonas, I think I have to go somewhere else. And he doesn't like me. Oh, it's not you. He doesn't know you. He scares me. Yeah, okay. You're going to freeze yourself standing there, miss Jonas. Are you lost? I hope not. Can I get you a cup of coffee? Oh, I don't want to put you to any trouble. It's no trouble. I'm not making fresh. How's your father? Oh, same. Well, a little worse. But I didn't come out here to talk about that. I'm here to ask you a favor. There's a girl I know. She's in trouble, and you might be able to help her. What's wrong with her? She need money? No, she needs a whole lot more than that. She's 17, and four months pregnant. Don't she have any family? No. Her mom threw her out. Well, what about the sire? Evidently, he wants nothing to do with her. Or the baby. All right, then. You got our attention. If you don't want money, what do you want? I want you to think about taking this girl in. Letting her live with you. Money would be a whole lot easier. I get... I think I lost it. Okay. Don't take mine. Mine are here. Okay. I got some more. Oh, yes. You got some more. You're early. I wasn't sure if they'd want to spend the night. They do. Oh. Ow. Ow. Yeah. They told you? Yeah. Don't ask. Um... I was hoping to have this... Conversation with you tomorrow morning, but seeing as you're... You're here now... What? What, what, what? Oh. I was hoping you weren't going to be that way. What? What way? I didn't want it to be like this. Not-not this time. Why don't you just tell me what's on your mind? I've decided to go to Denver for a while and stay with my sister. When are you planning to leave? In the morning. And what about the boys? I've been thinking about that. And I think you should just keep them. Oh, as opposed to what I've already been doing? I know that you already take care of them yourself. I can't do anything else right now. But I want them to come and see me. When I get settled in, after a while. Have you told them? No. I thought I'd tell them in the morning. Don't wait. They can handle it. All right. I know what I think. What about you? I say... We take her in. What are you talking about? Look at US. Living out here, set in our ways. How you going to change at this age of life? I can't say that. But I'm going to. You ever had a girl live with you before? You know I haven't. Well, me, neither. But let me tell you-- a girl is different. They want things. Girls got ideas in their head that you and me can't even imagine. And what do you know about babies? Nothing. But I've got time to learn. Now, look, are you going to go in with me on this thing, or not? Because i'm... I'm going to do it. I'll do it, not 'cause I want to, but I'll make up my mind to it. But I'll tell you one more thing. What's that? You're getting stubborn and hard to live with. Oh, that'll be your bus stop. There's a few kids at granite high who live out here. I can't do this. What was that, hon? I don't even know these people. I've known these men all my life. You don't need to be afraid. They may be a little gruff and a little rusty when it comes to people, but it's only 'cause they've been alone for so long. Vicky, look at me. You'll be safe out here. Uh... this here's the kitchen. We're going to go now and step into the parlor. This room is used mostly for reading, but you can use it any way you see fit. Would you like to see your bedroom? I would. The closet around there still has some clothes in it. They belonged to our parents. Of course, you can change anything around that you want to. We don't come in here. Our bedrooms is upstairs. If you want to take a bath, uh... It's in that, through that door, just under the stairs there. There's a brand new towel in it, too. Never been used. Do you like pink? Take a look. She don't say much. Do you think she's scared of US? Well, if I didn't know you, I'd be hiding under that bed. Woman: You've already convicted him without a trial. Mrs. Beckman, your son intimidated a student and assaulted a teacher. Our Russell never said nothing to that half-breed tramp. That's enough. Why don't you tell him, like you told US? Tell him what really happened. I never hit him. See? He grabbed my arm, I pulled away, and he fell into a locker. More then grabbed him, my boy had bruises on his arm. I just want to ask one question. Is he playing basketball this weekend or not? No, he will not. All right, let's go. I'm not forgetting this. You, uh... Warm enough in that room? Yeah... Yeah, it's fine. Good night. She eats like a bird. Maybe she don't like steak. Well, I had to scrape most of it to the dog. Did the dog eat it? Of course he ate it. He's a dog. Well, not everybody likes their beef steak covered in black pepper. What are you saying? You saying she don't like my cooking? I wouldn't know. If somebody doesn't like my cooking, Harold... They ought to speak up. I ain't running no restaurant. Maybe tomorrow I'll do something with the chicken. I thought I was paid up for the month. You are. Well? What are you doing here? Oh, I see. You came at a good time. I was just about to start my baking. You can help me out. Here. Read the ingredients. If you can read, you can cook. That way, you'll always be able to feed yourselves. Remember that. That's my son. Albert. He died in Korea. Who's the lady with him? Who do you think it is? Is that you? Don't sound so shocked. I wasn't born decrepit. Where's his father? His father was nowhere. That's where he was. I have to send one of you downstairs to get a box of brown sugar. Take that cup with the change in it, and that key that's hanging there from that hook. What's it go to? The front door. You might as well hold onto it, I can't be jumping up and down all day answering doors. Come on. Here. Our mother moved to Denver. We'll be visiting her tomorrow. Well, I guess you're looking forward to that, huh? Crowder expects you to attend that board meeting on the 17th. The beckmans will be there. And fyi, I am having a garage sale this weekend. My daughter is off to fort Collins visiting her grandma. I finally have the house to myself. Maybe I can talk you into coming over for a home-cooked meal. You free on Saturday? Saturday I'm driving the boys to Denver to, uh... Stay with their mother. Then you're free Saturday night. Judy... I'm still married. So what? Does that mean you got to eat alone for the rest of your life? There you go. Next. I'll be right back. Need a hand with those? Oh, hi. No, thanks, I got it. Oh, good thing I'm boiling those. You better get back in there before Harvey gets too creative with your boys. Oh, yeah. I'm just cleaning them up for a trip to see their mother. Oh, you all headed out to Denver? Yeah, I'm just, uh, dropping them off. I got a mountain of papers to grade. I'll probably go stir crazy and head down to the shoot for a drink. Oh, well, maybe I'll see you there. Dad? Okay. Great. You might want to come in here! He's trying to talk Bobby into getting a military cut. See you later. Okay, boys, finish up. Hey! Hi. Hey. Come on in. Here, let me take your bags for you. I hope you both are hungry, 'cause I went all out. I'm going to get some water. Hi, aunt Janet. Hi. I thought they were coming next week. Something wrong? No, we... Um... we were wondering what you-you thought of the market? We saw that soybeans was down a point today, but live cattle are holding steady. What about the pork bellies? What? The pork bellies. You forgot to mention the pork bellies. Anyway... We wondered what you thought, you know, buy or sell? Oh, I... I really don't know much about that... ...um, but maybe you could explain it to me... If you want to. Yeah. Well... the market is corn and soybeans, and live cattle. Those are the futures. Futures markets are... ...opening today. For a price. Just what he said. So, people buy and sell them... Exactly. Yeah. See, what happens here... Man: Let's have some music for 'em. Now dance! Come on, dance! Come on! Look at him. Well, if it ain't Jim McCoy. I can see by now he's caused some more bloodshed. Man 2: Yeah, thought they were ready to kill me. Come on, let's go! Move it! Yah! Yah! Tell that story again, bud. Okay. Terrell's driving, and he went crazy... And the dog, I mean, runs right in the middle of the road, all right, so Terrell slows down to see if he hit the dog, opens his door, looks back, and falls right out of his truck on account of him leaning so far out with that big gut. Thank you very much. Hey, are you out of here, Tom? Yep, see you, bud. Yep. Know the best part about it? Wait a second. The truck kept going. Didn't stop till it hit Ellen shaddick's Van. I'm losing my chance, bye. Tom? You're not leaving, are you? That was the plan. Mine, too. You mind giving me a ride home? What about your friend? Peggy? Shoot, she's just getting started. If I wait for her, I'll never make it to work on Monday. Oh, well, come on. It's not that far out of my way. Thank you so much for taking me home and all. Oh, come on, now. It's no big deal. Now, my truck's a little, uh... Oh. It's a messy truck, isn't it? Oh! Thank you. Maybe we should call dad. What for? What do you want to do? Where'd you get that? What's going on out here? Nothing. What was that? Was that an egg? Get inside, both of you! You think that's funny? And you wonder why your mother hasn't got the strength to get dressed? You should be ashamed. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Good night. You guys haven't said much about your weekend. What'd you think of Denver? We never left the apartment. Aunt Janet works a lot, and she counts her eggs. Shh! How's your mom? She slept. Mom still has a bunch of her clothes and stuff back at home. If she needs 'em... We'll send them to her. I think we should send 'em soon. What do you think, Victoria? Yeah. Which one do you like the best? You shouldn't be doing this. Why? What's the matter? We're just having a little fun, and we thought you were, too. Yeah... ...but it's too expensive. I mean, why are you doing this? Here, here. It's clean. You can keep it. S... sorry. Hey, there. I thought the plan on Saturday night was to meet up at the shoot. This thing, between you and Judy, where is that headed exactly? Judy? Oh, come on, how big of a town do you think this is? Oh... I just gave her a ride home. Nothing happened. Oh, good... Because I won't compete for you, Guthrie. I will not get into any kind of contest. I won't play that game. Good night. Good night, Victoria. Bye, Janine. Night, sweetie. I bet you thought I wouldn't be around for my birthday this year. And there's my present. Still baking, huh? What are you doing here, Dwayne? Can we, uh, talk in the car? You shouldn't be standing out here in the cold. Please? Tell me why you came here. You want the truth? I was hoping I could talk you into coming back to Denver with me. Why would I do that, Dwayne? So we could take up where we left off? You're carrying my kid aren't you? Yeah, but things have changed. You're right. I'm settled now, and I want to take care of you. What you all flinchy for? I'm not going to bite you. Did I ever bite you before? What am I supposed to do in Denver? Shoot, everything you can't do here. They said they saw her get into some boy's car. What do you think? Your home. Why don't you go hang your coat up in the bedroom closet? I'll order US some dinner. Jonas: Well, I spoke to Janine at the diner. And? And I'm almost certain that was the baby's father. Maggie, did we do something that drove her away? Oh, no, no, I don't think so. Thanks. Goodbye. Raymond? That calf wants to come now. Are you going to help me? Or not? Riding the bus is a privilege, ma'am. And if your child's committed three infractions, he loses that privilege. I understand. But I think your bus drivers need to learn to count to three. Is there anything anybody would like to add to that this evening? Yeah. What do you plan on doing about him? Mrs. Beckman? How's my son supposed to graduate when he's got that for a teacher? I can assure you we're doing our best to make sure your son graduates. If you make my boy miss his tournament, that is going to cost him a scholarship. Excuse me. Russell Beckman... Has not completed a single assignment, nor has he passed a single test the entire semester. If he's failing, it's because you have done nothing but pick on him since the day... I don't pick on anyone. I've been a teacher for 15 years at this school. And I can't even remember the last time I had to fail a student. I will not take the fall for a student who has been raised on a steady diet of ignorance and cruelty to others. Did you hear what he said about him? You keep talking, mister, you'll be defending yourself in a court of law! Tom? That was quite a speech you gave. Lloyd, I never intended to make a speech. No, but you did. Now it's my turn. When that Beckman kid comes back in your class, you're going to pass him. I want him out of here and graduated, you hear me? Have a good night, Tom. How'd it go? He wants me to start tomorrow. Excellent. He make you buy this? He didn't make me, I wanted it. Why? You live here now. Maybe I want to send it to somebody. Who? Those old men? Can you just turn on the heat, please? How you going to send something if you don't have no address? Come on, have another one. Girl: Grow up! Oh, he looked so stupid... ...he looked so stupid. ...so stupid. ...so stupid. ...so stupid... ...So stupid... Are you sure they're here? You're the one who left, honey. I mean, do you think they're even going to take me back? I don't know. You'll have to ask them. I'm afraid of what they're going to say. Well, they're not going to say anything if you just sit in the car. Go on. It's me. I came back. So, uh, I just wanted... I was wondering if... If I could live here again with you. Anyway, um, you know, I just wanted to say thank you and... you know, for all you did, and to say that I'm really sorry for all the trouble I caused. You were good to me. I won't be bothering you again. We can't have you leaving like that again. That's got to be understood. You better come in. It's cold out here. Mrs. Stearns? We picked up your groceries. Mrs. Stearns? Mrs. Stearns? It's US. Feel her. Why? Just go ahead. I want to touch her again. You ready to go? Yeah. Dad's not home. I don't want to stay here without him. Boys? Ike? Bobby? You okay? Yeah. I'm cold. Who is that out there? Is that the Guthrie boys? Yes, sir. Well, what in the world are...? Is your father with you? No, sir. Did you boys ride that poor horse out here all by yourselves? Are you lost? No, sir. Do you guys like grape juice? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Tell me if you want some more. There's no answer. Call Maggie. Hey, Maggie? I'm sorry to bother you. Can I use your phone? If this is about your boys, I know where they are. They rode their horse all the way out to the mcpheron ranch. Hello. Harold? It's Tom. I understand you got my boys out there? We sure do. Are they all right? It appears like it. They seem pretty quiet, though. Harold, can I, could you put on ike? Ike, it's your dad. Hello? Ike, what are you doing out there? We're having dinner. Are you all right? We're just eating dinner. Ike? Hello? Ike? Tom, I... I just wonder if you don't want to leave them out here for a while. You could come out in the morning and get them. No, I'm coming out there right now. He wants them to spend the night. Tom, sit still. Your boys aren't doing any more riding tonight. I promise you, by the time you get out here, we'll all be asleep. Come in the morning. Don't forget the horse trailer. Don't forget the horse trailer. And Tom? Don't worry about your boys. If it's one thing we know, it's brothers. Can I get you another? No, thanks, i'm-I'm good. Why would they ride all the way out there? They only met those guys once. They must have liked what they saw. Why are you stuck on that? If my own kids are looking for comfort from strangers, Maggie, they're sending a pretty clear sign that... That what, you're a bad father? Oh, come on, Tom. Your boys think the sun rises and sets on your shoulders. You don't know how lucky you are. Well... Thanks. For being home. Tom, is Ella coming back? No. Do you still want her to? I can't say. Take your time. You'll sort it out. Drive safe. Vicky: Please don't wake them up. Raymond: Wait a minute. I better check on those boys. Oh! Let me tell you something, all right? I knew this heifer that we had, and she got a-a long piece of fence wire stuck down her some way. But it didn't hurt her. Didn't hurt the calf. And it was a good-sized calf, too... As I recall. Woman: Dr. Brooks to labor and delivery. Dr. Brooks to labor and delivery, please. Hey. Maybe you two should wait in the hall. Where did that story come from? What story? About the heifer swallowing the fence wire. I don't remember that. I made it up. You made it up? And what else are you going to make up? Whatever I have to. Gentlemen, you may as well go on home. I don't expect this baby wants to come for a while. Why? What's wrong? Oh, nothing's wrong. It's her first child. It's very common to have a long labor. There's no good reason for you to be here. I can call you. No, thank you. We're not moving from here until that baby is born good and healthy and that girl in there is okay. What are you doing? I'm going home. No, you're not. Dad's coming for US in the morning. I'm going home. Why? We shouldn't have come. Hey, it's Guthrie's kids. Hey! Isn't it past your bedtime, little girls? You ain't going to get too far on that tired piece of horsemeat. You want to jump in? He asked you a question, little girls. No, we don't. Oh, really? Well, that's too bad. 'Cause you're doing it anyway. Let go of me! Let go! Put me down. Get in there. Get in there! Girl: Russell? Go, go! What are you doing? Someone's going to see US. Whoo! One of US needs to go home and check on those boys. And it's almost time to feed. I said, one... I'll be back. All right now, go on. Get out! They're just kids, Russell. Why don't you take them back? You can't make them walk from here. Yeah, you keep that up, you're going to be joining them. Get over there. Hey! You little girls can go home now, okay? Wait! Let me go. But I don't want to hear you crying to nobody about this. I don't want to think about what I'll do next time. Hey, wait a second. Is that all we're going to do? What, you got something else in mind? Go, go, go! Come over here. Come here, come here. Charlene: What's going on? Oh! Little punk bit me, that's what's going on. Go, go! Russell! Come on, come on, come on! Get his pants off. Russell, let's just go, please. You guys, put him down! Get his shirt, get his shirt. I got his shirt, I got his shirt. I got his shirt! Charlene: Russell, you're scaring me. He don't look so tough, now, does he? Oh, yeah. Bobby: Put him down. Take his shoes off. Get his shoes... I got 'em. Take 'em off. All right, throw it, throw it. Get his shirt, get his shirt! Go, go, go, go, go! Go, come on. Whoo! Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here. Just remember, you talk, you die. Come on, let's go, let's get out of here. Oh! Come on babe, let's go. Charlene, let's go. Come on, get in. Yeah. Ooh! Oh! Oh. You all right? They hurt you? I can't find my shoes. Where did they throw them? Over there, somewhere. Forget them. We'll come back tomorrow. I'm not coming back here tomorrow. Hello? Harold: Tom, you got your boys there with you? No. I'm going to go back out and look for them. I thought they were staying out there with you. Woman: Dr. Lawrence to room 336, please. Let's get her up there quick. Tom Mayer to physical therapy. Ike? Bobby? Are you all right? What happened? Where were you? Where were you? One of you better start talking here. What? They... they... They... Who's they? They who? We were... car... Who, who, who, who, who? Harold, can they stay with you for a little bit? I need to make a stop. Hey, you want to hear the radio? Mrs. Stearns died. Who? Mrs. Stearns, the lady who lived above the barber shop. We delivered her papers. Well, how do you know? We saw her yesterday. She was dead then. And we left her like that all night, but somebody has to do something about it. We can't just leave her there. You? What do you want? Tell Russell to come on out here. What's this about, Guthrie? Your son hurt my boys last night. I intend to talk to him about it. What are you talking about? You tell him to come on out here. Go get him. He's sleeping. Well, get him up. Now, you tell him in front of US what this is all about. What do you say happened? You finally went too far, didn't you? You've hurt my two boys now. You and that Murphy kid took them out in the country and scared them... ...and then you thought it would be smart if you took their pants off and left them out there to walk home?! Russell, do you know anything about this? No, i-i I don't know what he's talking about. I mean, I don't even know his kids, dad. Yeah, you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. I wouldn't know his kids if they were standing right in front of me. Get this guy out of here. You... you leave... Let go of him! You leave my boys alone. You hear me? You got a problem with me, you come to me! You see me about it! Do you hear me? Get out of here! I'm going to kill him. Shut up, Doris. Oh... What's going on here? Well, who's going to tell me? Guthrie here attacked my boy. He's come right to the house with some dirty, rotten lie about my boy and-and his kids. Is that right, Tom? Is that what happened? Don't you ever touch them again, you stinking, rotten coward. I will do whatever I want to your snot-nosed little punks. Russell. No, he's trying to act like daddy of the year right now, so what are your kids doing on the highway at 4:00 in the morning? Mr. Mcpheron, you can go and see her if you like. Well, um... Victoria? Yes. Victoria's okay? She's tired, but she's doing fine. Don't you want to know about the baby? What is it? It's a girl. Do you want to hold her? Oh, I don't know about that. Oh, just go on. Support her head. It'll be fine. There. My hands might be too rough. Well, she's got to get used to you sometime. Hey... Ooh... You know, I never counted on her being a girl... So I reckon it's something we can get used to. Knock, knock. Oh... She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen. Harold: Let's take this little lady home. It's a girl! Oh, you left out this part of the story. How many teeth did you lose this time? Oh, this is more of a... kidney thing. Ow. Tom: The good news is I got that punk to be honest for the first time in his life. The bad news is that they'll probably still reward him with a diploma. Ooh... Tom, are you sure you're okay? Oh, I've been worse. What? You weren't looking to go dancing tonight, were you? No, I figured we'd just sit by the fire and count your bruises. Yeah, these people are hungry. Hey, what do you got here? Hey! Tom: Oh, that smells good. What do you got there? Well, I wish I could say I made it myself, but I can't, and it's probably a good thing. Oh... Her first little cake. All she does is sleep. Look at that. Cute. Well, she had quite a journey. Thank you. Let me get something to eat. I think that's it. Well, doesn't this look great? Victoria: I am hungry. I got it. Harold: I got it. Want a burger? Yeah. Dad, give her back. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She didn't get you food yet. These look great. And buns. Harold: Thank you very much. Victoria: This looks so good... Captioning sponsored by hallmark cards and CBS
