My name is Oyin Clegg I am 35, I have a great job... I'm not married and no, there is absolutely nothing wrong with me. In fact, I am actually quite desirable if I say so myself. I take it you like them? They're beautiful. Not as beautiful as you are… I... Sorry Hello… So, why am I not married? - Hello… - Hey Princess! How are you? Good. You didn't respond to my messages all day. Hmm-nn Sorry. Full day. But you read all the messages. You could have at least replied Uh... Anyway, are you going out this evening? No. I... I have a wedding tomorrow. So I'm going to… I'm going to rest. Ok. I'll buy dinner and come over Er, you can't do that. I… Tonight is the bridal shower and it's happening at my place. Oh! I'll see you after the wedding tomorrow then Call me before heading out. Goodnight, love. Mm hm… Really. Why am I not married yet? Maybe because like all fairytale princesses… I want the perfect prince. ♪ Jazz man ♪ ♪ Are you back Mr Joseph ♪ ♪ I have not danced enough ♪ ♪ I have not retired ♪ ♪ Anyday I can entertain you on the MIC ♪ ♪ I will entertain you till I ♪ ♪ Rest in peace ♪ ♪ Thats right ♪ ♪ Stop if you cant dance ♪ ♪ Dance with some swag ♪ ♪ Hey you shake your body ♪ ♪ For the busybodies ♪ ♪ She danced the best ♪ ♪ Bubble and keep bubbling ♪ ♪ Haters can hate ♪ ♪ My people ♪ ♪ Throw your hands in the air ♪ ♪ Raise the roof ♪ ♪ Raise the roof roof roof ♪ Exactly! Babes, can you get off the phone so we can go? - Okay. I'll look through the documents - Real diamond earrings! Girl, where did you get this from? What? - Aunty, I'm not broke now. - Uhhhh! - OK, so where did you get them from? - OK, fine. Ossy got them for me on his last business trip. Ooh. Tell me exactly why you refuse to date this guy? Oyin, science student says that they don't have chemistry. They better have reserved our table I don't even want to hear stories tonight. - Hey, Madam. - Hey na, how far na? You don show, welcome Honey! I told you to wait up. Oh! sorry babe. I ran into an old friend, Oyin Clegg. This is my 'special' friend… Tara Cole. It's nice to meet you, dear. - Come on babe, let's get out of here - OK. See you around. Excuse me! Move! Calm down! Calm down, Oyin. The stupid girl actually called me "dear." I hate that thing. - Am I her mate? - She's pained She's really pained. Did you notice the difference in introduction? The guy was like "meet Oyin Clegg" my friend and then meet Tara Cole "my very special friend." I understand how you feel. But the name's kinda nice, though. - Yeah, - Ehn, it's OK. Ach! God Punish Kalu. Eh eh, what do you mean? I thought it was the phone selection thing you do, that he did right back to you. Mm hm! Okay, to understand what's going on here, let me give you some perspective... So, sometimes when I'm bored and I really need to get some… I do the phone select. I scroll through my contact list. And eliminate men based on certain criteria. What you want is a no strings attached guy Who will not interpret a night together as an invitation to a long term relationship So you cancel out the fervent toasters and “settle down” kind of guys. Then you eliminate those who are in places so far, it requires too much effort to see. Is this one a joker? Please, I am not the one that sent you on transfer to Bodija. All the way in Ibadan? When I finally make my choice… I put a call through… drop a few hints and hope he catches on. If he doesn't, I round the conversation off and move on to the next until I hit the jackpot This was the rigorous screening process I had to put Kalu through. But sometimes, even proven strategies fail. After a couple of nights together. Things changed. Kalu became clingy, annoying and intrusive Clingy Kalu indeed. With friends like you guys who needs enemies? And just so we are clear, I can get a guy as easily as Kalu got that... girl. - Oh really? - Hmm-mm! So, let's have a bet then You get a guy as hot as the babe Kalu got. Hotter! And if you do, I'll trade you My new Chanel bag that Kelvin is getting for me next week. Come to the asking. Wait, how are you and Kelvin coping with this long distance relationship? - We are managing. - So, wait... What's in it for you? Because the Gloria I know, does not just give up designer bags. Let's see… Hmmm... the Louboutins that Ossy got for you. - You are a thief. This girl is a thief. - But it's nice now! Well except of course, if you cannot get the hot guy we talked about. - I can and I will. - OK. - Cool! - Let's make a deal. - Deal, deal. - Ah-ah! Game on! What's wrong with this one? Who is that? Look at this monkey. Fried chicken. Animal. - Fried Turkey - Nonsense Uh! Where's this bartender? - I know. He's cute. - Yeah! Yeah, he is. Okay Look at him. How am I doing? You good girl. - How are the girls? - You got it Perfect! Just go already. I'll be back. - Ossy! - Oyin! How are you? You are... here. Yeah, I came to have fun like you guys. Errm... actually… - So… - I… I need to actually say hi to a friend. You know what, come and hang out with the girls Drink, sit down, have fun. I'll… have a good time. Ossy. Come on in. - Hey! - How are you doing my man? How are you girls doing? Not bad at all. Hmmm…. Such strong arms. That's it! A man of few words who knows exactly what he wants. Love it. Changing this, we don't want it. What are you drinking? - Ossy - Yeah Focus! Focus! - I'm here. - What's up? Come on, do something. Guys, excuse me. Hi, cutie! So how have you been? - Ossy! - Yeah. How are you doing? Focus now. - Drink something. - I'm good No, I'm… I'm okay You sure? I can feel it in my bones. This is going to be the best night ever! I was just coming to your office after I had my morning coffee. Make it later. I have a meeting in five. Uhhhm. Sorry I didn't respond to your voice note. Did you even listen to it? Good morning ladies… I'll see you later. You look so pretty today. Put your eyes back in your head. Let's get this meeting started. Good morning. Aw! Look at that! Uh, my ovaries! Na wa o So oppression has moved from Valentine's day to children's day. Good morning everyone. Morning! How many of you have heard about the Kester-Jacobs Corporation? Real Estate, Hospitality business and a growing FMCG line. Plus interest in fashion and lifestyle. Bottom line, They are a big deal and we have an opportunity to grab a big piece of it. They are accepting bids to cater to their Oil & Gas Services for every single one of their subsidiaries. We will do everything in our power to ensure that our bid is the winning bid. This is the guy we will be dealing with. Him? He is so young. That is Yomi Kester-Jacobs. The heir to the Kester Jacobs dynasty. His father has gone MIA for the last two years following an unfortunate copter crash. Well, rumour has it he lives in London with his wife. They don't attend any social gatherings. No visitors... except family of course. Is he a vegetable? I'm just wondering since he doesn't accept visitors. Well rumour also has it that he does his board meetings via phone. So no, he is not a vegetable. Or, the PR team is really good and they're spreading these rumours intentionally. Rumour or no rumour, this is the guy we are dealing with. Hm? I've had the marketing department draw up a mock pitch for them. Are we all clear? Yes. Good! And now for some good news. The Save Our Planet campaign board in New York was very impressed with our CSR project and they have sent glowing recommendations to members of the team. I also want to specially appreciate Ms Clegg here, for bringing up the idea and running with it. For Ms Clegg. In addition to that They have also opened up a slot in their team lead building workshop for one of the staff from this company. And it's lovely stuff. Ah... As much as I would want you to attend, Ms Clegg. I am sorry, you can't. Why not? I need you here. I can't trust anyone else with All Things renewable project. It's right around the corner and I need you here to handle it. Desmond will go in your stead. Good! Now, are there any other pending issues? Now everybody get back to work. Ughh! It's all wash. Let me tell you. The unofficial reason they don't want you to go is because you're not married. - What? - Yeah. Do you remember Francesca? The one the company sent to that trip in Atlanta for training? She never came back. That thing she did made the company come to the conclusion that it's because she's not married and she has no ties here and no reason to come back This is ridiculous. I know. But the company rules are the company rules. It's not fair. I worked hard on that project. It was my baby, my idea. - And now I… - Oyin, I'm sorry - Hello Mummy. - Oyinlola. You see what I've been telling you? Mummy, what are you talking about? What have you been telling me? Oyinlola Clegg! Get Married! Mummy. It's just morning or is it not too early for this kind of conversation? When I called you yesterday, did you take my call? - I was busy. - Ehn-ehn! And I I'm busy now and I am not really in a good mood. Ehnehn? Good! I'm about to make your day worse. Adebisi is getting married - What?! - Oho you heard me right Your school daughter that we asked you to take care of in Queens College. She is getting married! I have her aso-ebi right here in my hand. Oyinlola. Why are you hell bent on shaming this family? Mummy, I don't like what you are saying. Is it my fault I'm still single? Whose fault is it? Oyin. Please, what is the problem? Just tell me… Is it that the men are not coming? They are… Then what is the problem? They're not men I want to marry. I come against every curse upon your life. Mummy, I'm not cursed. That's now what I meant I am just saying that this thing might be spiritual and we might need to pray and fast to break it. Your eyes need to open to see all the available men. Mummy, I don't need all the available men. I need just one. I know. I know. But... Ma, we are ready. OK Mummy, I'm... busy at the moment and I even had to step out of a meeting to take your call, so I have to go. OK, I have to be in court as well, but you know all things need prayers, good or bad When was the last time you were in church? It's been a while. I've been busy. You see? You see! You cannot be too busy for the one who will answer your prayers. You cannot be too busy for God. I want to see you in church this Sunday. D'you understand? Yes Mummy, I have heard. Thank you. Talk to you later. Bye. That was long. What's going on? Hmmm Debisi is getting married. Which Debisi? Debisi your school daughter? Wow! Yes, wow! My mum is freaking out, maybe I should be too. Seems like just yesterday I was walking her to class after assembly. Oyin, we are getting old. Yes, we are. Come in. Ah! My favourite ladies. Aww Oyin, are you feeling blue? New York, New York! I know green is your favourite colour. So, I promise to buy you a nice green dress - As a present on my way back... - Get out of my office. Get out of my office! If you insist. Argh! Argh! Ahhhh! I would have preferred anybody, anybody else! - People can hear you... - I don't care! You know what? Woo! I need to go. I need to clear my head. Please. Please. Arrgghh! Hello, Gloria. Is everything OK? Who is upset? Ah OK. In that case, let's meet up at our usual spot for lunch. My treat, my treat… Ok and make sure you drag Oyin along, we'll find out what's up. Yeah? Alright. Talk to you later. Bye. Are... you Okay? How did you know I would be here? Let's just say I know you well. You're the only person I know who enjoys the sound of a printer buzzing in their ears. It helps me relax. I know. Besides, it's not the first time you've come here to clear your head Which is kind of one of the reasons I've had maintenance not throw this printer out. Is there anything I can do to help? Get them to let me go for the training. Er… Anything but that. Oyin look, the orders came from way up. You know, this is sexual and marital marginalization and discrimination. And I can sue the company for that. Well, yes you could, but they'll deny it and you really can't prove anything at the moment. It's just not fair! Is there anything else I can do to help? Oyin, but really sha, what's wrong with you? This is a hundred yards of husband material… uggh, but he doesn't give me butterflies in my tummy or make me giddy with excitement… Yeah, I know, it sounds silly to some of you but this woman wants what she wants. I'll be fine. Uhhm, one more thing… Would it be a bad time to ask you to be my date for my cousin's pool party. Which is in like three weeks? Yes. Yes? Well I tried. At least I made you smile. Thank you. Please let him know I'm here. Thank you. Alright Babe. I'll talk to you later. Err… Babe? Err… Did you not just hang out with this guy on Friday? Oh… please stop abeg. Is that not Desmond's wife? Desmond… Desmond Alaba? Yeah - Are you sure? - Ahnahn! One hundred percent! You know what? Just play along. Just play along. Just be a second, then you come - Ah, babe! - Hmm? How far Desmond now? - Which Desmond? - Ah-ah! How many Desmonds are in this office? Desmond Alaba now! Oh! That one, What about him? Is he still trying to date you? Is there anybody Desmond is not trying to date? Uhhh.. You know he was even trying to date one of my other friends? Are you serious? As serious as a heart attack. I'm not surprised. Are you sure it's the same Desmond, that drives the red car? Yes! You know since you did not give him the green light, he moved on to the next available ride. Rubbish! Anyway Hmmmn I turned down all his stupid advances. I mean the guy is married so… shhhsh He obviously has no respect for his wife. You should hear how he talks about her, calls her stupid,. Unintelligent, ugly. - Oh, my! - She is a horrible dresser… Desmond! Desmond!! Hey baby, you look… You bastard… You guys are mean! Oh my gosh, I'm sure that guy is in so much trouble right now. I'm counting on it. Stupid man! Instead of him to be doing his work, he's in the office, busy toasting women up and down. You know I actually don't feel so bad about him taking my place for the training anymore. - You are so mean - Too mean! I swear, so mean… anyway speaking of mean. Guess who called me before you guys walked in? - Who? - Roti Serrano. As in Moroti, Queens College? Yup. Anyway, she goes by the name Moroti Hassan now I think she married one fine Hausa guy. Of course she did. What did she want? Well she called me to tell me about the 20 year reunion for our set. Apparently, she is the head of the committee. Why am I not surprised? - I know right. Over sabi from time. - Uh! Anyway, she was calling to ask us to RSVP with our spouses. According to her, it's strictly a plus one event you know. Ah, doesn't this girl know that you girls are not married? Of course she does. She is a very stupid girl. She is just doing it to rub it in. Gosh, I don't like that girl. Please don't waste your emotions on her. She doesn't deserve it. No. Easy for you to say. You have Kelvin, Toke has Mr. new lover - Ahnahn! - And I'm… here being harassed in clubs by gigolos. Ehn? What? When did that happen? Are you guys telling me, you didn't actually listen to my voice note? - Ohh - ohh Sorry… But just... what happened... after I left? Well… After you left, things got even hotter between Mr fine face and I on the dance floor… ♪ Hey lover ♪ ♪ You wanna wanna drive me crazy ♪ ♪ I want you for the entire day ♪ ♪ You are my happy place ♪ ♪ Hey lover ♪ ♪ Hey lover ♪ ♪ Hey lover ♪ ♪ Hey lover ♪ ♪ Hey lover ♪ ♪ This song is for you ♪ ♪ Ever since I met you ♪ Excuse me, excuse me Thank you ♪ You take me high ♪ Ehnehn... Hanty, look, before we go hand henter the car park, I think we should discuss about price. I couldn't believe my ears. The guy had the worst H factor ever. I can live with most things, but a man with an H factor is just a no-no Ahh... Uggh, there will be no need to discuss price. - Because I am not for sale. - Ah! I am talking about the price of going home with you and servicing you for the night. Aunty, come now. You know what's up now. Ah-ah! I spent a good chunk of my night with you. I could have been chasing other clients. Are you mad? No, no, no. Are you stupid? - Aunty calm down... - Are you mad? - What are you saying? - Calm down Guy, what's the problem? What's happening? Is he harassing you? - Yes! Yes, he is! - Give me my money Uggh! Me, harass you? She is lying joh! Someone... that asked... for my services. And now she doesn't want to pay. Services? Which dirty services? I said I am not interested. So... the time I... spent with you. Nothing? Eh! Guy, Guy, Guy, leave this woman She is our person, leave her, she is not interested. Go - Leave her and go - Madam, please be careful… - You can leave, she's not interested. - With all these dirty boys o. That's how they behave. - -You can go. - - That's how they behave. - - Leave her. - - Madam, don't worry, you are our person. Don't worry, let's walk you to your car so no one harrasses you again. Thank you jare - Thank you, thank you so much. - No problem Let me find something for you. Happy weekend ehn Madam, more blessings. Thank You. Thank You. Really? That must have been so horrible. It was. And if those bouncers hadn't shown up when they did, I don't even want to think about what would have happened. Sorry, so sorry. But your girl had better luck. Of course you did. Message that I sent since Friday. It's today you are asking me "what messages did you send"? Well, I was in la la land. Ah. - We ate… - hmmm? - And smashed. - Ooh ohh and we ate a little more And smashed some more. Then we ate and smashed. Ate and smashed… Ok, ok, we get it! Wow! By the time I got home, I was so tired. I just slept off immediately. I hate you. - Gloria you nko? - Huh? What's your excuse? Because you also went AWOL. Wait, Don't tell us Kelvin is back in town and you didn't tell us. I wish, anyways from all indications. It appears none of us won the bet, So I guess everyone holds on to their designer assets. - Halleluyah! - Fair But I still want that bag. Okay, what is going on First mumsy harasses me for not going to church and then the youth pastor of my “once in a while” church calls. Maybe this was a sign. I really needed to be in church on Sunday. Hello, Pastor T. So Sunday came and I could not believe how late I was. So much for getting there before service ends. Pastor T had said he wanted to see me. Most likely a little scolding for not being in church for over a month… So I had to wait until his meeting with the ushers was over Thank you all for waiting behind, we'll make this really quick. A friend of mine came in from the States and he is going to be around for two weeks. And I wanted him to share with you leaders about leadership and success. He's a world acclaimed writer Please without saying too much help me welcome my dear and long-standing friend Adefemi Omotosho. Oh my God! Thank you so much. Errm, first and foremost Everyone just calls me Ade. That's a lot better. I am here to talk about my book. It's called The Epic and it is going to be made into a Hollywood flick. I am hoping that some of you'd read the book and watch the movie hopefully. So, I know you guys are wondering what's the story here this time? Well, Ade is one of my ex-boyfriends from way back… About ten years ago. He's hotter and richer now than he was back then though Or he definitely wouldn't be an ex… Sister Oyin Pastor T is looking for you. So I'm hoping that it actually does well. Once people read it, Like you can talk about it in the church. Then… Hey. Oyin. How are you today? Oyinlola Clegg. Adefemi Omotosho. Long time no see. Yea... You two know each other? Yes. Very well actually. Yes. Very well. So. How have you been? Uhm… I've been great. I'd ask you the same question but my eyes tell me everything I need to know. Small world, isn't it? Ade here is like a brother to me. We go way back. Pastor T. Senior Pastor is looking for you. I'll be right back guys. Ade and I were about to be alone in Pastor T's office Thank you daddy master planner. You're the best! May I offer you anything? Tea, water, coffee, juice? Are… Are you sure? We have fine wine as well. Smallie, get out! You're wasting valuable time! - No, thanks. - No. Thank you very much. OK. Thank you. You look even more beautiful than the last time I saw you. Hmm. You don't look too bad yourself. - You've changed a lot... - Ah That I have. I have missed you… A lot. Really? Yea I mean. In the last ten years, I haven't found anyone who could replace you in my life. And everytime I was in a relationship, somehow I I managed to carry you into it with me. I guess that's why they didn't work. I guess that's why I'm still single. Yay! He's still single! He's still single! Okay! Okay Oyin, calm down, calm down! Let him know you're still available quickly! Ah… It's funny, I'm still single. I've tried but… No one could take your place. And I had to let them all go. So this is not like a coincidence or anything. Us meeting here right now, like this. I guess not. This has to be divinely orchestrated. I mean like, I left the country over seven years ago And I haven't been back ever since. And the one time I come back, we meet like this. This must be like the universe aligning or something. I know right. Look, I am in town for a few weeks, I was wondering, would you like to hang out? You know show me a few places where you go to... have fun. Why d'you want my hand? Your phone. Oh, my phone. I am so sorry. - How else are we supoosed to hang out, if… - Ah... you can't reach me? Yes. Yes. I am so sorry. Please put your number in here. Please. Thank you. Ade, I… I know things didn't really end well between us and I just wanted to say that - I'm so sorry for how I... - Hey, hey Shhh… It's fine. OK. I mean, I was… I was hurt. But that's all in the past. OK? I am just glad that you can be mine still. It's a lie! No one can tell me I haven't died and gone to heaven! This was too good to be true. I'm glad… I'm glad too. Sorry for keeping you guys waiting, you know how it is. Yeah, it's fine. You just gave us time to catch up, that's all. - Ah? - Yeah. Great! So Oyin, to why I wanted to see you. I would like you to be a part of the singles committee. They organise a lot of events and fun outings and you know all the fun places in Lagos. I see your Insta and Whatsapp stories…. All of them? All of them. Errm... I'm sure I can work something out. So you'll join? Yes Pastor T, I'll join the singles committee. - Great! - But not for long pastor Not for long. Hello. Yes I am purposely ignoring your calls And no I do not want to talk about it. Look, what happened was a mistake and one I would like to forget. So can we please just move on from that and get on with our lives, please. I have to go now, I have work to do. Should I be worried? About what? Whoever is making you smile like that. Ohh This is just my friend… You have nothing to worry about. I like the sound of that. If you did like the sound, why were you acting anxious? You didn't have to… Excuse me. Are you blind? Can't you see this seat is taken? No, I see it's taken alright… By my fiance and his next play thing. Excuse you! Derrick, what's going on here? Derrick? So you are Derrick to her? Actually, his name is Peter - Peter Omiyale. - Tosan! This is his instagram page. And this is the IV to our wedding. We are getting married in a week's time. You're what… Possibly the 15th girlfriend he's had in the three years that we've been dating. Silly me. I keep thinking that he'll change But he's not going to change He is never going to change. So I guess that's it. Baby Baby, no! Baby, look you can't do this. Look, baby Baby, You are the love of my life. You know that is the same thing he says every time I threaten to leave him.

Just a customer calling. Nothing serious. Excuse me, I will be right back. Well... I had fun tonight. So did I. Did I tell you how beautiful you looked? You did. And also did I tell you that all the guys couldn't stop staring at you? Really? I didn't, I didn't notice. Because I only had eyes for one man. Oh my!!! If this is a dream, I never want to wake up from it, because everything is just… perfect! OK. So… This works? Yeah. I prefer it to the other one. Uhm. Alright, Oh, have you decided on a design? He's leaving. Ade is going abroad in two weeks and I'm worried. I would really like some form of assurance, before he goes. I get what you mean long distance relationships can be a handful. Hmmm. What do I do? You are not going to pick that? Nope! It's my mum. And I really don't want to talk about why I'm still not married. Just pick up. - I mean you can't ignore her forever. - Hmm-mmn Hey babe. Hey babe. Hope you still like wearing those lovely gowns. I'll come pick you up at seven for a special dinner. Make me drop dead when I see you. I should absolutely be a stylist I know. You did a good job. You need more booty and some vaseline. But she looks absolutely gorgeous. - She looks gorgeous. Look at her. - Hmm-mnn Hmmmn! He's here! Shhh… Just wait. I'll get the door. You don't want too look too eager. Okay. Go girl, I'm so excited - Hi! - Hey Errrm... Good evening. - Good evening. - How are you doing? Not bad at all. How are you as well? I'm fantastic. Errm, is she ready? Well. See for yourself. Hey. Hey. Shall we? Or would you rather spend the entire evening looking at me? Honestly… That's actually not such a bad idea. But I… as tempting as that prospect is, I actually have something special planned for tonight. Oh? So we have to… we have to leave. Is that fine? Enjoy your evening. And you too. Yah! This is nice. Oh, I do try. - There you go. - Thank you. You're welcome. This has to be it! The assurance I need. No one goes through all of this trouble. If it isn't a proposal… - Good hevening sir. - Good evening. Good heve… Good evening ma… May hl do the honors? Oh please. Care to share the joke? Errr... It's nothing really. I just remembered this stupid guy. Who was trying to outsmart me. But he ended up making a fool of himself instead.. Where? Err... What's... for dinner? Anything that you can think of, is on the menu. Oh! I like the sound of that. Bring me some pepper soup for starters, and… Make it snappy. - Sir. - Hm? What would you have? What she said. Thank you. That's a very weird individual. Hmm-nn! Anyway tell me what does your dream life entail? Ahh... Well. It entails a future with you. Lots of children, a big house filled with happiness and laughter. Babe... Have I ever told you that you are the most beautiful girl that I have ever seen in my life? Only about a million times. Then, not nearly enough. I was going to wait till after dinner but I don't think I can wait any longer. Oyin Clegg. I… I have something for you. This is for you. So wait what were you expecting? Hm? A wedding ring? Oyin, you had me. Then what did you do? You threw me away. I mean it's … it's been years but. Remind me… you said I was foolish. You called me an idiot. I… You said I was jobless, useless. Basically, what you were trying to imply was that I had no future. But now you see me and I'm somebody and now you want to waltz your way back into my life. Trying to reap where you did not sow. I asked you to tell me about your dream future. What it entailed. Well, let me tell you what mine does not entail. A gold digging opportunist woman as my wife. Have a nice life, Oyin Clegg. Ade… Ade… So, aunty, I can see that uncle has left. Tell me now, When is the... wedding? Useless Fool. Madman. It will not be well with you. Madman. Useless fool Hanty! Hanty! Hello… Hey babes… Ossy…? The one and only… I was at the office and was told you called in sick. What's the problem, love? Nothing. That's not what I heard. - OK - Ah ah Which one is this monosyllabic answers you are giving me? Sorry. Anyway, I'm at your door, open it. Where? You are at the door? Don't keep me waiting. Hm! - Hey! - Hey you. How are you? Come here. I would say you look a hot mess, but I guess you kind of already knew that. Ossy, what's wrong with you? Did… you go down a cup size or... - Ossy! - Sorry. Ahnahn! Sorry. It seems like you haven't eaten in days. Alright I'll make you something to eat. After all I am not just a dashing young man, I'm also very good in the kitchen. So, what do you have in your kitchen? Let me know what I am working with. - Don't burn the house down. - Me? OK. OK. You tried, you tried. - I tried? - Small. - See this girl o. - Small. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Ossy isn't bad at all. I know and I agree… If only I could get past the fact that that I don't connect with him on a sexual level. Trust me, I've tried… And there's the issue of his last name. No way I'm exchanging Clegg for... Oni-sa… However you say it. You good right? - Thank you. - Alright. By the way, I… left something for you under the microwave, I hope that will cheer you up. What... I... Oh my God! Ossy! Ossy! And that's how Oyin Clegg got her groove back And was on her way to the airport. Are you serious? I swear down! He really likes you. I know… Maybe… I'll consider him when I get back. Oh… Are you serious? Please, please. Everybody, slow down. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Because the last time I pictured myself walking down the aisle with someone, it didn't end well. Errr… I guess. We'll talk about it when I get back. I have a flight to catch. I… Mumsy is calling me… Oh. Ladies… Kelvin is calling me too so I have to go, OK. Alright babes, I'll keep you guys posted. I'll let you know when I get there. Love you. Bye Bye. - Hey baby, I've been... - Oh you Why've you been calling my husband all the time? Err... You stay the hell away from my husband. You hear me? He is married. Read my lips! - Excuse me, please... - Married - I would like to speak to Kelvin. - Hear me OK. Now get lost hussy. You still keeping some stupid girl all the way in Nigeria? You crazy son of a bitch! Babe, I will call you back. Sorry, I'll call you back. I promise. I promise! Ah! Oh! Ugh, shoot me now! Of all people to run into… Hey Dear! Moroti. Darling, how are you? Fancy running into you. I know right. I mean Lagos is so big. Who would have thought? Actually Lagos is the smallest state in Nigeria But I get your misguided point. Hmph. So, where are you headed? - Dubai. - Ah. Yeah, I needed some me time. And you are going alone? What about you? Where are you headed? - To the UK, as always. - Hmmm Abdul and I are taking the kids on a vacation. As usual. That's... nice. Oh yes, It is. It is. It can be very stressful, you know. But I'd rather deal with all of their wahala, than not to have them at all. You know what I mean. - Yeah… - So… Are you coming for the 20th reunion? I spoke to Gloria about it. Yeah… She mentioned. Ah… So I take it both of you are not… coming? Considering the fact that you are supposed to come with a spouse. Okay, that's it! Somebody hold me before I jam my foot in this witch's mouth… I'm sorry I'm late dear. Thank you for waiting. Is this your friend? Hello. Yomi Kester-Jacobs. I... The Kester-Jacobs? Is there any other kind? Hi! Hi! It's really nice meeting you. Hmmnn. Oh… Oyin, you never said anything, considering the fact that we are friends… Ah… We've been trying to keep it hush hush. I wouldn't want the media and the tabloids harrasing my girl now, would I? And I'd like to keep it that way. Of course, of course. Lips are sealed. Thank you. It would actually be an honor to have you at our 20th reunion. Oh. I thought you said it was for married couples only. Don't be silly Oyin, I mean for him we can make an exception. Well… Babe and I, we have really crazy schedules. - But… - True. - We'll take a look and we'll let you know. - Hmm-nn It's alright… It's really nice meeting you. Indeed! Nice meeting you… Oh, I need to rush and meet my husband. But I have to pick my child's pacifier first. - Right. Bye! - Bye. Ugh. I thought she would never leave. I can imagine. I overheard your conversation. And I just couldn't resist. I had to be the prince who saves the damsel in distress. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, Miss… Clegg. Oyin Clegg. Ah! So, you're going to Dubai. Luckily for you, so am I. So I get to be the lucky man who slays all the dragons in your path. - If you don't mind. - I… No, I don't. Excellent. Shall we? He was travelling alone And I was travelling alone. So we decided to travel alone together. No, I don't believe you. That's not possible. Look. Swear down. I have no idea, how we survived boarding school in Ilorin. What's wrong with you guys? You mean to tell me you've never done anything that's completely out of character for you? - No! - Hmm-mmn OK! It happened a few years ago when Gloria was dating this low life, good for nothing, absolute rubbish of a human being. Ahnahn! Tell us how you really feel then. Sorry, it's just that every time I remember I get pissed all over again. So... this guy was dating Gloria and he is a married man. But he was stringing her along. So we were going to get our revenge. We were going to do an Italian job on him, but we decided for a greedy man. He had been bragging to Gloria about this contract that was coming for him, how big it was and how he had money in hand and whatever. Fool! He had a stolen proposal to which he had only the hard copy, he had no soft copy. And then we… What's wrong? Man, I'm off to the toilet. My tummy is acting up, please. That is how he lost the contract. Mess with me and my girls You will not get away with it. I'm… I'm slightly scared of you now… You should be. And just a little turned on. Fool! That's where they will see you. Ah! - I wish we didn't have to come back. - Uhh - Tell me about it. - Really? Then let's go back. Right now. - Huh? - We'll book the very next flight. - Are you crazy? - Only about you. I had so much fun and... - Ohh? - My schedule is crazy. And so it begins. Look, I have to take this call. It's OK, I'd like to say hi to my friend. Hey! What the hell was that? What? Don't' act dumb Oyin. I saw him kissing you. Oh. We met on the trip and we connected. You… Wh… What does that even mean? You met him in like what, four days and you connected. And I've been here waiting for you for two years? I didn't ask you to. Oh! I see. Look, Ossy, I'm sorry if… Sorry for what exactly? Ehn? For dashing my hopes over and over again? Or for falling for a guy you met on a trip that I paid for? I'm sorry that things are the way they are. Hey babes… Yea... Who is this? Err... A colleague from work. I am here waiting for my madam. She's been away for about a week and it seems her flight has been delayed. Sorry about that. Yeah, you know. The things we do for love. Tell me about it. Listen, how about we go wait in the car While they sort out our luggage? - Hmm? - See you at the office. Yeah. Pleasure meeting you. Same here. - What? - I know. All this for just you? - Ah. He spoiled me sick - Wow! Are you kidding me? Oh, this particular day was so much fun. But wait, why didn't you put this on your insta-stories and Whatsapp stories now? Well, Yomi is very particular about media and tabloids. Oh, yea... That now explains how Ossy didn't even know what was going down in Dubai. Ugh! Can you not remind me about that? I'm so not looking forward to bumping into him on Monday. Which is a good thing, you guys never dated. So, Or did you ever… maybe have something? - Nah. - Nothing at all? Sorry ladies, I'll be right back… Dubai Babe! Hmm-nn... So. How is she handling Kelvin's betrayal? She's been very withdrawn. Men are scum! - Simple! - Except my Yomi… I hear you! Oh. Hello, Pastor T. Good afternoon. Yes, I was out of town on err… An official trip. What?! Was the trip not mandated and paid for by my boss? - What else is an official trip - Yeah, I'm fine… Everything is just perfect. At least that's what I believed until… Wait… Is that not Ossy? No, No, No. Wait! Just take it easy. - - What the hell are you doing with Ossy? Ehnn... Don't even try to deny it - because we saw you outside kissing! - Right now Ossy is my boyfriend. He's your what? - Your boy what? Your boyfriend? - Gloria. Are you for real? Because this is my Ossy ooo! Ehn? What did you say? Girl, watch what you say or I will scratch out your eyes. What do you mean by your Ossy? Ossy has never been yours. He is not yours and he will never be yours. So get that straight. He is not yours. - Are you for real? Are you serious? - Am I for real? Ok! ok! Please calm down. I am very calm. OK! Let me ask you. Are you the only one that wants to marry? You think it's just you? And what is so wrong with a single guy, a very single guy for that matter, wanting to settle down with someone at my 36 years of age? - Hmmn! - He wants to settle down with you? Is that what he told you? Because he was seriously talking about marriage with me only a few weeks ago. Well... Sisterly, things can change in a few weeks. Oh. And this your few things they are very, very confusing. Because I can't even remember you and Ossy being friends - and now you are talking marriage. - Can you imagine? Must you know everything? Woah. God. And it's thanks to you. - What? - Yeah. It's all thanks to you. It all started at the night, at the club, when you told me to get rid of him. He didn't want to go home and I didn't want to go home either. So we decided to go to another club. I tried to get him to stop drinking but it didn't really work. He was hurting for Oyin and I missed Kelvin too. Before I knew it, we were both drunk, but he was way more than I was. Ehnehn! So the two of you have been sleeping together this whole time? No, It was just that one time. And although, he did try to reach out to me, He didn't want you to know about it and neither did I. And then he saw you and Yomi at the airport and he figured that there was no use of him waiting for you, so he came to me. I was already in a bad place with Kelvin and… We just sort of clicked. Wow! How touching. Oyin, please... Please. Thinking about it, you actually don't have a right to be angry. You are happy with Yomi, aren't you? You are happy. So if Gloria and Ossy feel they have a chance together. I think the only thing you can do is to just support them. Fine. Whatever. It's just… I was just surprised. - Shocked. - Me too. But… But… You deserve to be happy. We all deserve to be happy o! At least some of us don't have any man in our life. So… Oh by the way ladies one more thing. Oyin… Would you be my chief bridesmaid? What? I told you Ossy was serious. And he actually proposed. But I wanted to let you girls know first, And you beat me to it. Congratulations. Isn't it too soon? Hey love… Hey babe, where are you? Yeah, I'm with… Toke and Gloria, What's up? Great! Some of my friends just got into town and I need you to come with your girls so we can hang out. Uh. Oh… Sure. The girls will need to change and get ready though. You can just send an uber and pick us at Toke's house. I'll send you the address. I'll send the driver that'll come pick you. OK. See you soon. Bye. Erm... That was Yomi. He wants to hang out and wants me to bring you guys along If you are feeling up to it. Cool, it's fine. It's fine. I'll just go change. Okay No-no Let's just go, because I... don't want to talk about that. Wooh! Hello! Will you marry me? Yes! Oh my God! Congratulations! - I am so happy for you. - I am getting married you guys!!! - This is beautiful. - I know! It all feels so surreal. Girls. I can't believe this is happening. Congratulations. Gloria, about your request…. Yes, I'll be your chief bridesmaid. Yes! And that's how I became the trending topic on the internet and everything started happening so fast… First, I had to perform my bridesmaid duties… Then I faced the stress of picking my aso-ebi… Figuring out the guest list… And the weight of settling for the perfect dress… thankfully my darling husband to be wasn't sparing any costs… In the midst of it all, I had to settle my friend, after all, Gloria was now married to Ossy, and I was getting married to Yomi. It was just right that Toke should have someone to settle down with as well… With all the love and friendship in the air I couldn't wait for my big day to come… Oyin Clegg was finally getting married! Yomi… Yomi… Yomi… Go in. He wants to see you. ♪ Hey lover ♪ ♪ This song is for you ♪ ♪ Ever since I met you ♪ ♪ I am not the same girl ♪ ♪ You take me high ♪ ♪ High like a bird ♪ ♪ Take me to a place ♪ ♪ Where I have never been ♪ It's alright, Oyin! Mummy, it's not. It's not. Have you not heard what we've been saying? Toke thinks I should break up with him and collect hush money to keep his secret. At this level? What do you mean? So Toke wants you to continue to be single like her,abi? Mummy! No, wait... let me talk. Oyin. Every marriage has it's own peculiarities. Ok. You remember at your Uncle Tade's burial? The light skinned tall woman with two boys? Yeah, the one that you said was your cousin. Well, she is not my cousin… We had to tell you childreen that so you don't think bad of your uncle. She was your uncle's side chic. And the two boys were for your uncle. And your Aunty Dunni. She is single again. Why? Her husband started dating a younger girl. She was thrown out of the house with her girls. And all the inheritance, gone to another woman. So you see. You do not have to worry about these things if your husband is gay. - He is not my husband yet. - Hmnn My pastor thinks I should end things and have nothing to do with the Kester-Jacobs family. Your pastor? Hello Pastor. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. Oyin is here with me. Concerning what we discussed yesterday. I'll hand her the phone now. - You told him? - Yes na, I had to! When you called crying yesterday like the world was coming to an end. Take it Take this phone from my hand. Hello Sir… Oyin, how are you? I'm fine sir. Your mother told me what happened between you and your fiance. There is nothing God cannot do. Sir, did she give you all the details? Yes. She did. That is why I said, there is nothing God cannot do. Ah! Sir I don't know about this one o! Have I not been your family pastor since you were a child? Was I not the one who christened you? You are, sir. So trust me Oyin. We can remedy this situation. You can both come for counselling and deliverance And thereafter, you come for the wedding. There is nothing God cannot do. OK. Have you heard? Ah! I've heard. You can give the phone to your mother. Let me have a word with her. Thank you sir. Pastor. Ok, ok, sir. Alright, Thank you. Alright, Bye. So…? Mummy. I don't know… What don't you know? This is common in high society Lagos. Yomi is from a good family, he spoils you silly. He can give you children, so what else do you want? Oyin. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. The devil you know is better than the angel you do not know. I've said my part. This is all so confusing… If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Listen to Pastor T and have nothing to do with Yomi and his family? Take Toke's advice and collect hush money for keeping his secret? Listen to my mum? Or do what me and the girls did to Johnson?
