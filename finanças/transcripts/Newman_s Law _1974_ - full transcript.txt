I-I was wondering if I could ask you a personal question. Now, like, if I was to confess to you that I wasn't entirely up to somethin' legal, you wouldn't hold it against me, would you? See, the fact is, I was trying to find this poker game. We got a game. Ain't no big stakes, man, but we gamble, and I'm gonna give you my full trust. That's why I had that blade, man. Them dudes, they watch, man. If you leave the game a little heavy, man, they gonna try to rack off a piece. Now, you dudes trying find a bigtime. You don't wanna mess with a cat playin' a little cards, man, shootin' a little dice and trying to protect himself, right? - Hey, listen... - Hey, man. Don't drop this shit on me! You little jive turkey! That's a good boy. You're under arrest for possession of narcotics. You have a right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney present during questioning. If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you without charge prior to questioning. - Do you understand... - Yeah, old man. ...the rights I have explained to you?

Damn right, you friendly. Listen, man, I'm trying to give it to you straight. Now, from what I know, this dude gets a hundred times this action. Now, what that sound like to you, uh-huh? Bullshit. Gimme a roast beef on a roll and a corned beef on rye to go. Done. No, I need another one. Hey, come on. Hiya, Vince. Hi, Al. We busted JC at the hotel. He wants to trade, little fish for a big fish. - Want me to check it out? - Yeah, sure, go ahead. Hey, how come that guy never made lieutenant, anyway? He gets too involved. - We got time for another game. - Come on, let's go. Look, all I know, it's in the house back there. If it isn't, you're up for life. And if it is, then I don't get booked, right? Nothing to track me here, right? It's okay by me if it's okay by my partner. 2 King 10 to base. Go ahead, 2 King 10. We're at Hill and Ord, we're gonna do a little fishing. 10-4. Hey, man, you have to make it that tight? Don't go away. You see that? Pedestrian hazard? - When you're hot, you're hot. - Why not? Police! Open up. Vince! Freeze! Put your hands on top of your head. Now, what are you doin' here? He's clean. Easy... there we go, yeah. Okay, he's set. I'll get the front. Make him? Yeah, it's Johnny Dell. Johnny Dell? What the hell is going on here? Hey, partner. Hm, well, I'll be. Looks like we busted in on a robbery, Vince. Yeah. Is this 683-2171? Yeah. This is the overseas operator, we have a person-to-person call for Mr. Dell. Is this he? Yeah. Go ahead, Naples. This is Falcone. You get all the merchandise? Yeah. Whaddya mean, "yeah"? Did you get 75 kilos or not? Hey, what the he” is this? Dell. It's Dell. Son of a... This is Sergeant Newman of metropolitan police. I just had a call from Naples, Italy. Now, I want the caller's name, number, and address, if possible. Who was that? Would you believe Lo Falcone? You're puttin' me on. I worked him for two years, practically put him to bed every night. I better talk to Charlie Heist, you take this. When you get finished, get Reardon, tell him we need lots of help. Look, man, don't be jivin' no more. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You give that up, anything you say can and will be used against you. Hold it! Hold it! The hell wrong with you, man? You crazy? Shootin'! Get away from me! Hey, skipper. Looks like we got a big one. Get the ambulance. What's happening here, Vince? We got burglary, forced entry, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer. We got 200 pounds of what looks like hash. We got a homicide, and we got a call from Naples, Italy, from Lo Falcone. Falcone? You sure? Falcone. I talked to him. My God, Vince, you're gonna make Mr. Eastman, our golden boy district attorney, very happy. You better get back in the house. That's it, Mr. Eastman. Falcone. You're sure that's what he says. - 75 kilos, no mistake. - No, sir. No mistake. Come on, come on. We got the phone company breakdown. 2:23 p.m., approximately one minute. Naples. That confirms time, duration, and point of origin. - It's Falcone's house. - Who's the dead man? John Dell, a k a John Dellanzia. Okay, we've got John Dell, well-known underworld figure shot dead in Falcone's place. What about the wounded suspect? He was apparently burglarizing the place when he was interrupted by Dell. The house is rented to Barda Enterprises. We linked that to Falcone back in '68, here it is. Lemme have it. We got the lab report. Falcone's prints are all over those bags. We got him. We're gonna finally drag his fat ass off that mountain. Gino! What's the name of the guy in Naples, the police liaison? Vitelli. Espatori Vitelli. Get him. All right, now, lemme hear it. I'm a tired bus driver with hemorrhoids, I never asked to be on jury duty and I don't wanna listen. Make me understand what happened. This house is being used by Falcone, a known, convicted, and deported narcotics importer living in Naples to conduct his dope operations. An unconnected burglary exposed the operation and resulted in murder of Falcone's associate. - Operator, I wanna place a call... - I don't know. I wanna hear him. See, we've been after this guy for 12 years. No smartass lawyer is gonna chop us on anything like illegal search. You dig, Newman? When my partner and I arrived at the residence in question, we found a pedestrian hazard. There was garbage in the street. My partner went to the door to inform the inhabitants, and I continued investigating for further violations. - What do you think? - I got Vitelli. What do you think? I think you gotta go with the informant and step it out. - Uno momento. - Routine surveillance. Observation of felony in process. - Hot pursuit. - I don't know. It's muddy. The deals and progressions, they can hit any link. Uh, either way, it comes down to his testimony. Well, do we need that? We've got the prints. They're not enough. They prove he touched the bags but not the hash. We've gotta have the phone call. It's still up to him. If they believe him, we nail Falcone. I'll buy it. Let's do it. Gino. Tell him hello, ask him how he is. - È bene. - He's fine... you? Great. Ask him how his wife and daughter are. - Son. - Whatever. Is that enough of that? Now, ask him if he's still got the Falcone extradition file from last year, and tell him to open it up. This time, we make it stick. We're gonna nail this mother's hide right to the wall, right, boys? Allora. I love it when he talks like that. I'm sayin' this, we're gonna make Golden Boy famous. I don't care if they build him a statue, partner. Just as long as we get Falcone. Sergeant! - Sergeant Newman. - That's Newman. - Come on, would you? - Don't pay no attention to his jive. I don't, but... - I talk jive? - Come on, Sarge, I got a message for you. You're supposed to clock out for dinner and check with the duty officer after, that's it. You're one of these dedicated new breed of cops, huh? Yeah, I guess so. What do you think, Garry? - I think he's all right. - Damn right. - What's your name? - Jimenez. Yeah. Whatever. Listen, you really wanna get out of that harness and make the Bureau? Hell yeah. See that guy in the car? He runs a bunch of nine-year-old kids pushin' junk in the schools. We gotta let him go. But maybe he don't go too far. Here's the word, Jimenez. We're gonna hang loose on that joker, let him make a break for it. When he goes by you, we'll let you put three right in the old knockwurst. Don't get fancy. Just lay him on the money, rip out the gut, and he'll beat out before you know it. Don't worry, we'll back you up. Shot while trying to escape. I didn't shoot you no jive, did I? I didn't jive you now, right? Now, you gonna let me go? You belong to me, dealer. I'm the man. I say "frog," you jump, dig? All right, all right. I dig. Hey. Go the other way. Ta-da! Hi, Bill. - Hey, Vince, this is a big one, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. - Come on, tell us something. - Are they gonna extradite Falcone? I can't talk. I can't talk. Newman! What time did ya sign on this morning? Uh... 6:05. - Has Garry checked out? - Yeah. Well, you I got to extend. Eastman wants the paperwork before the morning. The name of the doctor for the report, the officer's witness statement. The homicide report can wait. Homicide? What homicide? The Charlie Heist you shot was DOA at the hospital. Skipper... I didn't shoot him that hard. You didn't, huh? Well, you hit him that hard. What'd you use, your head? Benny. Hey, Newman. I need the doc, official for this report. Well, it's Kramer, but he's in there cuttin'. Take it in to him, if you don't mind gettin' it a little sticky. Vinny! Vince. - Mr. Dellanzia. - Mr. Dellanzia has no comment. When did you first hear about your nephew's death? Please! He's very grief-stricken. Did you find out about that here, or did you find out before... Please, everybody, no comment! You know who that is? Dellanzia. He wants to talk to you. Twenty minutes out of your life. Listen. I swear to you, it's straight. Listen, Vinny, no matter what they say, I'm still a cop in here. I'd kill myself before I'd mess up one of you guys. Hey, guess what? Kessler himself signed this. Eastman called and wants it bucked straight up to him, those too. Really cookin' on this one. You gonna go on extradite? - Vinny? - Hey, buzz off, will you, Beutel? Vinny. Vince. Twenty minutes. Ten minutes, and you walk out. Newman, it's 50 bucks to me. And I need the bread. The old man was really broke up. His own nephew, shot dead in Falcone's place. For God's sake, Lou. He's a cop, he's gotta be carrying! Come on. He don't know which is worse: Having his nephew dead, or having his nephew in with Falcone. Sit down. Newman. Hardhead. Gives nothin', takes nothin'. That's the book on you. Hardhead Newman. How come you got to be such a hardhead, Newman? My mother was Italian. That worth 50 bucks? We're ready to pay more. For what? Give him the envelope. That's $10,000 for information on who wasted Johnny and why he was in Falcone's pad. I thought maybe you'd tell me about that. Mr. Dellanzia believes you're on the wrong track. Like, you're making the assumption that Johnny Dell was runnin' dope with Falcone. Mr. Dellanzia says no way. The $10,000 is to make you see he's serious. Falcone got into it with the union core. That's why he's there and we're here. Falcone, when he took the fall, none of us helped him. Right? Because the man deals in hard drugs. That's a cause, and it makes noise. We don't like it. Yeah. Ain't it hell? Take it. Take it. Take it! I'm not him. I'll fix it. Vinny? What's wrong with that? He's not askin' for anything bad. Rich men with kidnapped sons offer rewards for capture and conviction. Every bank in the country's offering rewards... and bonuses. And who the hell collects? Civilians? How would they? Cops? It's legal, it's legit. Straight dollars, Vinny. You pay 'em on your income tax. Know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes? I'll tell ya. 'Cause the guy you were looking for was too close. Right across the desk from you. Closer than that, Walter. I love you, too. And coming up next on KBAC, the late news with Clete Roberts. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening, this is your late news on KBAC. Mosher Heights was the scene of a dramatic shootout today when two city detectives stumbled onto a murder, a robbery in progress, and the largest haul of narcotics ever recovered by local police. Detective Sgts. Newman and Garry discovered the bullet-torn body of underworld figure John Dellanzia along with 75 kilos of hashish at a residence on Hill Street. The narcotics are valued by the police at almost three quarters of a million dollars. Dellanzia, known as Johnny Dell, was presumed to have been shot during the course of an attempted burglary of the premises. A black, unidentified male suspect was found on the scene and was shot by Sgt. Newman while attempting to escape. The suspect was later pronounced dead on arrival at Memorial Hospital. Late this evening, District Attorney Jack Eastman announced that Frank Lo Falcone, well-known mob figure of a decade ago, was linked to the case. Falcone, now living in Italy, was said to be the source of the contraband narcotics. Local political observers noted that District Attorney Eastman's action against Falcone would easily provide him with a decisive advantage in his forthcoming race for a Senate seat. Mr. Eastman stated that the extradition process was simply a logical outgrowth of his 11 -year-long investigation of Falcone... Yeah? Well, Mr. Newman, I see I finally caught you at home. You see, I've been trying to contact you... Who is this? Mr. Grimes, in charge of the nursing home. I've been trying to reach you for days, Mr. Newman. Is my father all right? Oh yes, we're taking good care of him. But your account is about $1,000 overdue. I'm afraid we can't carry you and your father any longer. You'll get your money. Yes, when will that be? You will get your money. We'll be back with more news, weather, and sports after this message. Hey, look at it. When'd they build these things? Ten years I'm gone, I come home like a tourist. Yeah, that's right. I guess there aren't any junkies in the old country, huh? It's all me, right? Falcone, the slimeball dealer in the sky. He goes down behind a ten-year dope fall, gets thrown out of the country, the streets are all neat and clean, right? It's a start. Newman, that's why you're still a sergeant. You ever fight? You've got a fighter's moves. I remember when there was all kinds of fighters; Now, they're all colored... oh, black. Our kids got too fat. Take off the cuffs. All right, boys. Mr. Falcone'|| have a statement for you in a few minutes. Hey, gentlemen, keep the elevators clear now, huh? Thank you. All right, we'll take him. - What the hell you doing? - It's all right, it's all right. We'll take questions over here. What the hell's going on? They paid bail in straight bills, $200,000. - Don't worry, we've got him. - You just remember your story. We'll stick him. Mr. Falcone, if you don't think they had a good case, why do you think they brought you back? - What? - Why do you think they brought you back, sir? - Why? - Yes, why? How should I know why this rich young man with so much ambition... It's hard to understand. A slum boy like me should be ambitious to prove himself, but Mr. Eastman is rich since childhood. I don't know why he should want so bad to destroy me. He should play tennis, let the serious men do the work of the world. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. You brought him back. Now what do you think of this development? I think it's a bunch of crap, what do you think? 650 grand lost to the cops. Lo, nobody could help it. Somebody tipped the house before we could get the hash out of it. I told you, leave a little stuff! Fifty grand's worth, fifty grand! Who screwed up? Why didn't that cop we bought take my call? Newman got there first. Lo, everything was perfect. Look. We snatched Dell and wasted him on schedule. Quist was gonna pick the stuff up when Newman showed up. I was lucky I saw him. Too bad our man didn't know he wasn't our cop. Quist, gimme your gun. You set up the house, you buy the cop. You rub out Dellanzia's nephew and I waive extradition because you say! If they bring me back, I can live here free and clear. You say our bought cop would leave for Costa Rica before the hearing and they got no case. But now, we got Newman. And that hardhead would walk through fire to get me. We have a plan. We're gonna pull the plug on that pig Newman. Here. You can put away yours, too. Relax. You'll live longer. Bullet exited the front of the left thigh 27 inches from the bottom of the left foot. Irregular exit wound is 1/2 inch in its greatest dimension. Shreds of fatty tissue extend out and around it to lengths of one inch. Dissection of the thigh revealed that no major artery had been severed. - What did he die of? - Subdural hematoma, bump on the head. What'd you hit him with, Vince? I didn't hit him that hard. Sometimes you get 'em like that. It seems like hardly a mark, but they're gone. - Anybody claim the body? - Nah. Where's Dell? We took what we needed and gave back the rest. - Which shelf? - Top shelf, second from the left. Two slugs, one's a magnum. - Two guys. - Had to be. Jesus. What are the taxes here? No, no, no, no, don't tell me. If I gotta ask, I got no right buying. - It's a low-crime area. - Yeah? That's good. By the way, word has on the street that Falcone's buying black soldiers and guns. Yeah, but why didn't Charlie Heist really run away? And I keep thinking about that JC cat. Now, how did he know this job was going down? Hey, Vince... Well, tell Edie we'll be late. Tell her my partner's a fanatic. It was an accident. I don't believe in accidents. The cop, Newman. So he bends things out of shape a little bit. So I straighten it again. When do we move? We wait. We've been waiting. Listen, I've heard that BOO-year crap. - This is not 300... - We got a deal. If you and your boys want a piece of the action. You wanna learn? You wait. You wanna stay in the gutter? Okay. Go. Wait how long? Till Falcone says “now." When's that gonna be? Tomorrow, you got a first hearing, tomorrow's court day. Tomorrow is Newman day. Okay? Now. Pull the plug on him. Come on in and join the party! Thank you. Good evening. Who's your friends, JC? Hey, man, you cats think I'm some funky dude that you can bust in on without no warning, is that what you think, boy? No, we were just passing by, we saw the lights, and we thought you might answer a couple of questions for us. At 1:30 in the morning, man? Shit! - They trouble, man? - Oh, no, just two jackoff artists trying to find some action 'cause they can't get it up for each other no more. People... me and my lawman, we got a deal. And the way it goes down, nobody, nobody touches me, you dig? I'm clean like a snowbird. - Nice place. - Yeah, nice. Right on. Tell you what I'll do for you. I got something just for you cats. - Go tell Ginger it's time. - On it. Come on, party, man. Come on, man, come on. You send me, baby. Yeah, all right. Presenting Ginger! Hey, sugar man. What's the matter? You don't like my color? It's all pink on the inside, honey, can you dig that? What you got to lose? - Is this the bedroom? - Bedroom? That's the master bedroom, master. - Hey, Valerie. - You're here! - Give us some sugar. - Yum! Uh, sorry. Uh, stop, they're taken, I hope you understand. You can believe it. We just came by, saw the light, thought you might want to answer a few questions. Like who put you on to that hash? Hey, you, Tom! Yeah, you, brother. What you doin' with him? Brother, why don't you just split on outta here, huh? Just passing by, saw the light. Thought you might like a chance to cooperate with your local police. Good law enforcement starts with you, the citizen. Cooperation and open community relations is what makes it work, right, partner? Right. All right, Newman. Since you wanna stay, then you might as well stay for the whole show. Hey, what's going on? Back up, back up! What's the matter with you? You're on the pad, dealer, do you understand? You owe, you gotta pay. Now, who tipped you off to that action? Newman, what am I gonna do with you, man? Wait a minute, man, wait a minute! Don't do that to my bedroom! Hey, what's the matter with you, you guys? I don't know no names! It was some dude, man. - Some dude, huh? - Hey, man. Peace, brother. Yeah, brother, I didn't catch no name, really I didn't, man. Hey, brother! The hell wrong with you, man? Hey, look. Do better. Wait, wait! Hey, man it... Wait a minute... Quist, Quist, Quist, all right? That is all, I done told you everything. Now why don't you just get outta here and leave me alone? Our book is closed. Dealer... your book's never closed. No, no, no! Back off. And it rained for 40 days and for 40 nights. And the rain came down, the rain came down... Ahhh... we're gonna be off shift with court duty tomorrow. Maybe we go out tomorrow night, grab a steak, maybe bowl a few lines. Yeah. Whatever. Let's see, yours is the, uh, frozen dinners... - cornflakes... - Yeah. You get any fresh fruit? - Uh-uh. - Any fresh vegetables? - No! - Fresh meat? Oh man, junk, junk, all the time! All you eat is junk! It's got no nutritional values, Edie told you that, I told you that. You don't know how to take care of yourself. Sue me. Hey. What do you make of it? Or how do you figure? I don't know. Think about it in the morning. Get some rest. Show me some ID. Here you go. I'm Spink, my partner, Hinney. We're from IS Central Division. Can we, uh, come in? Why not? What do you guys want with me? Well, we just wanna have a little look around is all. We got a warrant. Then why did you ask? Come on, we don't like this any better than you do. Gotta have the key. You ever seen this stuff before? No. You're under arrest for possession of narcotics. Have to take your piece, Newman. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney and have the attorney present during questioning. If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning. Do you understand all these rights I explained to you? What do you think? What the hell is this, Newman? - I never saw the stuff before. - What do you think? Well, might be able to say Newman was holding physical evidence, gonna check it in to criminal property today. Newman? I never saw the stuff before, I don't know how it got in my apartment. Now, you check my record, I'm clean. You wanna talk to the snitch? We can give you that. Damn right I do. Oh, for God's sake. Told you everything I know. Yeah, well, tell it again. Who was the police officer you and Dell were dealing with? Thomas Vincent Newman. Right there. That's Pants Squillachode. - We know who he is. - He'll say anything. I know that. Now, uh, your father is Kelly Newman, now a patient in the Golden Time Convalescent Home? That's right. Your bill there was $985 overdue. Approximately. Well, Pants here says he paid it. Paid a whole lot of bills... Doctors, hospitals. He's got canceled checks to prove it. Now, why would he do that? What's he in for? Receiving stolen goods, grand larceny, and assault. So he's going down anyway, right? What'd they promise, Pants? Take care of the wife and kids? Who's paying my bills? He can't say no name, he'll get a shiv in the lungs, - you know that. - Yeah, but you can't believe him. It's crazy. He's a three-time loser and a full-time liar. Yeah. Well. What do we do? We sure as hell don't go into court now with this story. And without him? You're dead. Listen, how about an investigation of police corruption? What do we do with Falcone? We drop the charges and send him back to Naples. Mr. Frank Lo Falcone. Is he here? Right this way, gentlemen. Frank Lo Falcone. How you doin'? I'm from the Immigration Department. I have a court order for your deportation and a warrant for your arrest. Could I see that court order, please? Excuse me, sir, but who are you? I'm his lawyer. Well, you may have standing in court, but this is not a legal proceeding. Mr. Falcone is in my custody, he'll have to come with me. That court order is ten years old. Read this. My orders are to get him to the airport for the 4:15 to Naples. All right, take him. This is a writ of habeas corpus, we'll file suit for false arrest! Hold it! What the hell is all this? - He's got no rights here. - I'm afraid he has, sir. My client was forced to return to this country on a court order and was subsequently cleared of all charges. If you're trying to say that he can get back in this country... Correction, sir. He is in this country. That writ merely prevents you from sending him back. The rest'|| have to be decided in the courts. You really gonna fight this? All the way up to the Supreme Court, if necessary. We're dealing with the rights of the individual versus the power of the state. Mr. Falcone, how do you feel? This is my home, this is where my friends, my family live. I intend to remain. This is a beautiful, beautiful city. I don't see no dirt, no filth, no crime. All I see is a beautiful city. Newman? Newman? Chief, in here. What's the matter, they're too cheap to put numbers on the door? You want a beer? Yeah. Boy, bein' a cop on the take doesn't pay like I thought it did. 22 years I been trying to sell out and I couldn't find a buyer. Funny. The headhunters are out on you, Vince. I got two ways to go: Summary charges or direct suspension. Either way, you go down. - Eastman. - He wants your ass. But, they don't have enough to make it stick if you fight it. Are you gonna fight it? What do you think? I'll tell him you're gonna fight it. Meanwhile, you're suspended until the hearings. I got no other choice, Vince. Did you see that on television, that dope dealer getting free TV time? Now, doesn't Eastman know it's a setup? 17 years, 3 citations for excellence, not one mark in the record against him. Does anybody have some questions for him? You're no good to them anymore. They don't care about anything else. Garry, you're reassigned. I'll leave you lovebirds to say goodbye to each other. You know what? I just figured it out. We don't need this. I mean, what for? - Right? - I gotta go. Listen, when they legalize all this, when they say, "Hey, kid, you wanna shoot up? Go ahead, just don't bug us." When they do that, what do I say to my kid who said, "Dad, what'd you do for a living?" And he's on his way to the neighborhood dope shop for a boost. Don't fight it. Is that it? Hey, listen, Vince: Just resign. They'll let you to save newspaper stories. We could go private. - Like Beutel? - Nah, nah. Like Biggs and Camargo did in Cleveland, they set up their own business. So, they sit in a few trees, watch a few motels, but they also pick up on some good open offer reward action. When you get a chance, pick up the rap sheets on Johnny Dell. One with a girl on 'em. But, you can do me a favor. See if you can get the key to that house we made the bust in. Vince, didn't you hear the man? You're through with it! Oh, Mr. Newman. I got to tell you, the others were complaining about his radio, so we had to put him by himself. He doesn't seem to mind. Also, the manager asked me to thank you personally for your check. Hi, Dad. How you doing? Got you a book. Couple of candy bars for the nurses. The reason that I didn't come by Tuesday was that I... I was out of town. I'm in a little trouble, Dad. I didn't want you to hear about it anywhere else. I don't want you to worry about me. You just eat, do ya hear? Can't on keeping losing weight like that. I'll, uh... I'll come back Thursday, and we'll talk it over then. I'll bring some batteries. - Jeez, I hate this paperwork. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - See you tomorrow, Skipper. - Yeah, goodnight. 10 bucks. Go right through the awning. Hey, wait a minute. Where's your camera? - I don't need one. I got a photographic memory. - Hey, no way, buddy. You wanna feel merchandise, you go down the block. Here, you gotta have a camera. $3 an hour. We throw in the film. Sharon? How did you get my real name? Johnny Dell's Sharon. Oh. Pig. Male chauvinist pig, that is. Johnny Dell rented the bod, but he didn't own the soul, if you can dig that. - Mhm. - Are you a cop? I'm a collector. Oh, far out, and I'm gonna put it all in a book. Turn three-quarter left. - How's this? - Beautiful. Okay, I've already answered all the questions. Except why you're running with that slimeball Dell. Listen, are you gonna bust me? 'Cause I'll just change my story. No. Well, I didn't think anything was gonna happen to him. What does that mean? Well, it was kind of set up through his friend. Johnny Dell was shy, so this mutual friend got us together. - And paid you? - Yes. Johnny Dell was shy, but he was also very tight with money, which I didn't know. Anyway, all I had to do was make a phone call when he left in the morning. To the mutual friend? - Yes. - Who? Who? That Black cat Quist. Anything else? Yeah. Lay down. Now, smile. You're some crazy cop. Do you know that? Newman! Vinny, I've gotta talk to you. Later. Vinny, come on, do me one favor. One lousy favor for a 20-year vet. I've got a message for ya from the Dellanzias. It's very special, I swear to you. Vinny. Vinny, wait... Vinny? Vinny, buddy? Ow. I had to do it. You got me in trouble, buddy. It's never been like this before. There's a war out there. All the rules are out. They don't kill cops, but they would've killed you for nothing, if I hadn't... They... they figured you double-crossed 'em. Word on the street is Falcone bought a cop, and maybe it wasn't you, but, Dellanzia, he thinks so. I had a hell of a time convincing him you were his best chance to find out who hit Charlie. Get out. Vinny, you gotta believe me. This time you won't walk away. Get out. Vinny, it would've been worse. But, I stood here for you. They don't understand. I'm still a cop in here. Hey, you can't come in here! - Did ya hear what I said? - Cool it, Jimenez. Sergeant Newman. The ghetto. Even that has a cop out there, but they were the hand-me-down clothes - and the hand-me-down guns. - And when we were infiltrated by the FBI, everything was super efficient, and now that they're gone, - you can't get a cup of coffee with 'em. - You wanna get with Blackness, baby? Then you get Black. You can't go in. Look, I got my orders. So, for Josh's birthday, we got this organdy shirt with a lace front and the lace cuffs... Oh, it was beautiful, William! Mr. Eastman. Yeah, I'll take care of it. Excuse me. What's he doing here? Why didn't you stop him? I tried to stop him, Mr. Acker. Newman come into the study. We'll talk. - All right, what are you doing here? - I found out something about Falcone... Look at him, bleeding on my rug! - Close the doors. - I'm sorry. I found out about Falcone, and his boy Quist. They set it up. I think I can prove it. Pfft. How do ya like that? Sherlock Holmes. From a cop who sold out. Don't you ever say that to me again. - Now, look here, Newman... - Don't you ever say that to me again. - You get him out of here! - Mr. Eastman. - We believed in you. - Newman, try to understand from Mr. Eastman's point of view. Maybe it happened that way. Maybe Falcone did set it all up. Maybe you were framed. It doesn't matter now. We've got him another way. We're offering to accept a plea of guilty to concealing possession of narcotics. - In return... - That's a sentence of 1 to 10. So? He's an old man. He can get out in three months. We did the best we could. Frank, explain it to him so he can understand. - Falcone has agreed. - Falcone, what's he got to say about this? We negotiated a plea. - Negotiated? - Plea bargaining. Don't tell me you never agreed to simple possession so some pusher wouldn't fight a weak case. We're not talking about some 5 and 10-cent pusher. You blew it! If it weren't for you, we would've had him cold. Your part of the bargain's 30 days probation, all right, before you're reinstated. That's it. You oughta be grateful, Newman. Mr. Eastman's being very good to you. He could just unload it all on a dishonest cop. Jimenez, give me a handkerchief. Yeah, sure, Sarge. Why aren't all you dipshits out patrolling the streets? - That's it. - Gentlemen. Okay, you freak! It's no deal! Ya hear me? No deal! You're through! You know, I decided, the life of a cop is not healthy. Hey, why don't we quit and go into business together, me and you? Business? You wanna take care of business? You get yourself another woman. - You find your own woman to patch you up... - Mommy. - ...and take care of you. - Mommy. Yes. - Come on, I'll take you to bed. - Thanks, Edie. Did you manage to pull that key for me? Vince, you're in a box. They got you. There's no way out. Can't you understand that? Hey, look, don't fight it. They'll drop the charges, you'll get off without prejudice. There's a leak. A cop on the take. He's somebody who knows about this case. Sure, but what you gonna do, yo-yo around the street, trying to push, figuring they slipped some place? They didn't. - Honey. - Just a minute, Honey. Hey, Vince, look, out on the street it's open season on you now. Do you understand that, Vince? Well, I'll go home. Oh yeah, sure, you'll go home. Shit. Hey, Newman! Hey. Sugarman! Hi, pretty White boy. What you doing back here, honky? Newman! - Freeze, asshole. - Peace, brother, peace. Buried, slapped, out. Sorry about that. Scum. I called you, but your line was busy. Yeah. Edie figured you'd call and wake the baby, so she took the phone off the hook. How'd it go? You come up with anything at the Dell house? Nothing. Did you tell anybody that I was going over there? Hell no. You got all the trouble you'd need without them knowing that. The, uh... The hearing result was posted. You're fired. I guess, uh... Edie's pretty upset about the idea of you and me going into business together, and you dropping off the force. Yeah, well, you know. I mean, you know. Yeah. Self-preservation... I guess you gotta think that way. Where are you now? Four years from pension living. - Big deal. - That's only money. Bread. You know, I can remember when you used to worry about it. I guess you're free from all that hassle now. - All right, Vince, go. - No, I just noticed you don't complain about money much anymore. - Forget it. - Oh, come on, Vince, I know you. We've been together a long time. You got something to dump on me? - Do it. - Do what? Get off me, Vince! I don't know what's eating you. Sure, every now and then I think, "Why not? Maybe the world does owe me a lousy steak sandwich on the house once in a while!" We can't all be Jesus Christ. - But, you're implying that I... - I'm not implying anything. All I asked you was, "Did you tell anybody" - "that I was going over to the Dell house?" - No! Oh hell, forget it. The hell with it. - Don't you walk away from me! - Garry, outside! - Wait a minute! - I said, "Outside." You were 40 minutes late signing onto the watch. I covered for ya. - Thanks, Chief. - Look, Vince has loused himself up real good. You wanna go down with him, just clue me, and I won't lay my tail on the line for ya. This is Pete Jimenez, he's gonna ride with ya tonight. - Oh, we met. - What's this? Please, just finish the watch. Take him out, buy him a taco, take him to a movie, and sign out. All right, let's go. - Hey, you got a scrambler on there... - Yeah, leave it alone. Man, just for the record, I don't like tacos. I do. Newman, be nice. Leave. Sure. What the hell does he mean coming on to me that way? He's suspecting me. - The son of a bitch. - Who? Will you butt out? It's a personal matter between friends. Hey, look at that. Yeah, I hope they kill each other off, and not some poor, dumb cop trying to make family peace. - What are they fighting about? - Who knows? - Another Mexican wedding. - Oh, come on, man, will ya? If he does that again, I'm gonna punch him out. Feels good to be waited on instead of doing the waiting. You're gonna get it! It was Newman! I'm gonna kill him. - Taking potshots at me. - Don't you see that's what he wants? Why do you think he staged this Oswald routine? I don't know anything about that! All I know is I'm gonna... Besides, we got a lot of money invested in you, and you're the only guy we're gonna make sure, damn sure, - that stays alive. - Look, if he wants me dead, I'm dead. Don't you understand? Gotta understand human nature. This Newman son of a bitch can kill anybody. As it stands, if we go after him, - then he'll be calling the shots. - No way. I'm gonna teach him my game. I'm gonna blow that son of a bitch right out of his shoes. All right, but do it right. Excuse me. Get the hell out of there. Sorry. How would you like some clown messing around in your personal things? ...just taken over. Shoot! Split! Split! Jesus, oh, Jesus! - Get an ambulance. - It's no use, Vince. Get an ambulance! I'll get those exits covered. Get 'em! Here! Give me your cuffs. You gotta get me out of here. Okay, Quist. Go that way. He spotted me. I had to move early. Looks like he's still alive. Let him bleed to death. - What are you gonna shoot him again? - All I could think about was Garry lying back there. You know what I mean, Vince? Sure, he could last for a DD. Give you a dying declaration? Why should he? Why not take the chance? Give me your card. Yeah. Hey, you get the Captain. I'll do it. Sure, Skipper. But, the last wounded man I left you with didn't make out too well. Come, on Vince. What are you talking about? You remember that heist man that didn't run very fast, just like he knew the set up? - Like the cop they bought wouldn't shoot. - You're wrong, Vince. Garry and I fell into it, and the heist man didn't know it, so he jogs down the street and I shoot him in the leg. And then, he winds up dead at the hospital from a blow in the head. I didn't hit him that hard. I'll get the doctor. Newman. Reardon. We bought Reardon. Get this. Do you understand...? - I need your help. - Name it. I need a car outside that door, fast. You got it, Sarge. - Hey, go ahead. - Ah, ah! All right, ahh, ahh. Say, "Ahh." Ahh. Hey, easy... ooh! - Oh gosh, oh... - Mr. Dellanzia. - It's Newman. He wants... - Ohh! - What do you want? - The money. Yeah, for what? That's the one that killed your nephew, Dell. Get it. I hear the news on TV. That's carrying a lot of heat. I wasn't planning on keeping it. Yeah, I forget you're still Newman. Hey, don't go away mad. Maybe we got more business. I need more integrity than I can buy. Edie? Edie? It's Newman. It's Newman. It's Newman. He can't get home. He's gotta go out. It's Newman. It's Newman. It's always Newman. Even when he comes home, he just sits and watches TV. I say to him, “Why won't you talk to me like you talk to Newman?" And he says, "Me and Newman, we don't have to talk." Always Newman. Every cop in this city eats off the path. But, Newman can't, so he can't. Oh, $18, $19 dollars a week he pays to be with St. Vincent. Newman. Newman, come back and see the baby. Newman, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm telling you, I did everything I could. He's out of his mind. Wait a minute. I'm a taxpayer. If Newman comes after me, I'll call the cops. What do you mean, “Calm down"? Listen to this! It's a machine gun, stupid. I want police protection and I want it now! Reardon! - Take the back. Get the side. - A male... Hey. Sarge. Easy, easy. - Jimenez. - Don't try to talk. What are you? One of those dedicated, new breed cops? Yeah.
