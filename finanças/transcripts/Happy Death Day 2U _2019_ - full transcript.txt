What's wrong? Ugh... Um, nothing. No, it's... Look, Lori, I have been the worst roommate. You've always been there for me, but I've been way too selfish to even appreciate it. Can we start over? I promise not to be such a loser. Are you high? On life. Oh! By the way, I want to hear about this mystery guy. When extreme agitation occurs, locomotive response in the subject shows - an acceleration... - Dr. Butler. Can I have a word, please? What the hell do... What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm ending this. Wait, what? I never should've started seeing you. It was wrong, and I... Anyway, I can't change what I've done, but I can start trying to be a better person today. What lame little self-help book did you get that from? You know what? You have a wife who loves you so much. So if you can't be faithful to her, at least have the balls to leave. Don't expect me to let you coast by in my class now. Already dropped it. I just have to say how totally sad and disappointing it is when certain people can't be bothered to make it to a mandatory house meeting. We were supposed to be picking this year's charity. Becky? Is that chocolate milk I see? I skipped breakfast... Oh! Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Oh, my God! That is so good. What's up with the fat fest? We're Kappas. Come on, hon, live a little. Few calories won't kill ya. No. It'll just turn me into a chunker. Like Becky here. Okay. Oh, my God! You'll be okay! Hey, Tree? Hey. Just, uh, coming by to... What was that for? I have to run, but what are you doing later tonight? Nothing. Do you want to take me out for my birthday? What's the punch line? Look, I know it's really random, but I promise I'll explain everything tomorrow. Assuming there is one. Just say yes. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Excuse me. Can I pay for my coffee, please? You're not gonna eat? No, just the check, please. I'll be right back. Hi, Daddy. Sorry I'm late. Like your tie. Thanks. How's school? Fine. Like your classes? They're fine, Dad. I don't want to do that anymore. Do what? Small talk. It's just that... this day... this day is really... hard for me. And, um... I miss Mom. You know? I miss her so much. I miss the way that she smells. I miss that crazy horse laugh she has. Yeah. Me, too. And I... I guess I thought that if I avoided all of it... if I avoided you... that somehow it would be easier. But it's not. It's been so much worse. All of this running and hiding has made me so miserable. And I think I finally figured it out. For me, it took something, like, totally crazy, but... but I'm here. And I love you. And I am so, so sorry that I hurt you. Happy birthday, baby. Stay calm. I need you to stand up. Slowly. Slowly. Okay, good. Okay, this-this is a really bad idea. Okay, well, so is dying for the 16th time. Okay. Now turn around. I need you to listen to me. He's going to escape. We can talk about this. Just put the gun down. He's going to escape. Go get help. - Go! - Okay. I know you're not asleep. Open your eyes. Safety's on, little girl. Ah, ah, what do we have here? Hmm? You know, real nice surprise, you coming to visit me like this. Whew. I like you. Damn shame. But you're a feisty little shit, ain't you? That's right. Crawl, little girl, crawl. Or... I'll just make this one real quick for you, okay? Hey! Safety's off. Thanks for the tip. Who took my hairdryer? So, this has got to be, like, the strangest birthday you've ever had, huh? You have no idea. Did you ever figure out how Tombs got free? No. No one knows. It's kind of like Houdini. Yeah. I guess. What are you gonna wish for? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? That's... I mean, isn't that kind of a given? You want to aim for anything higher? No. Tomorrow's good enough for me. Shut up! ♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪ ♪ And I ain't gotta pick up the phone ♪ Oh, hey. You're up. - ♪ It's my birthday... ♪ - Carter? Yeah. I'm surprised you remember my name. You were pretty wasted last night. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. - What? - I killed him! I stopped it! Who? What are you talking about? What's going on? I mean, look, you were probably just having a bad dream or something. That happens to me all the time when I'm drinking. You know, I... Nice one. Dickhead. She finally rolls in. Going somewhere? Yes. As far away as possible. Tree, what's wrong? Me. I was wrong. I thought if I stopped running, that I could beat it. But it's never gonna stop! Tree, you're freaking me out. Oh, well! That's me, a freak! Tree... Tree, look. Happy birthday. Thanks, but I already ate it last night. Oh, my God. I died in my sleep. What? You killed me. What? You poisoned it. But I never ate it before. So you had to find another way. Then Tombs fell right into your lap. Perfect scapegoat. You had access to him. Did you drug him first? You knew that if he escaped, everyone would assume that he killed me. But it was always you. Tree, are... is this a joke? You think I would actually try to poison you with a freakin' cupcake? Okay, then. Prove it. Go on, Lori. Take a bite. Go on, Lori. You really are crazy. Okay, then. I'll take it down to the police. I'm sure they can tell us what your little birthday treat is made of. You stupid little whore. I know I've been a bad roommate, but isn't this a bit much? What the hell?! Oh, I don't know, maybe because you wouldn't stop sleeping with him. What? Gregory? But he just kept choosing you. Over me. Guess all he wanted was a cheap slut like you! Wait. You've been killing me over some stupid guy? Oh, that's not the only reason. You're a dumb bitch, too! But what I really want to know is... how did you figure it out? Because you've killed me before. Then I guess I'm just gonna have to do it again. Ow. Ow! Ah! No! Bitch! No! What the hell is going on in there? Nothing. Tree just fell. Everything's fine. Whatever. Clumsy hoes. I better see you at the meeting today. We'll be there. Eat it, bitch! What are you losers doing in there? Lori... ate... my cupcake. I just knew there was something wrong with Lori. She never wore makeup, never posted any cute selfies, and she literally owned a pair of Crocs. All the signs of a psycho killer were th... Hello? I'm trying to get interviewed here. Oh, my God, she is such a tool. Anyhoo... Lori's little plot was super lame. Poisoning a cupcake? Really? We're Kappas. We don't eat cupcakes. - Is this local or national? - ♪ It's my birthday ♪ - Local. - ♪ And I ain't gotta... ♪ - Tree, honey, are you okay? - Hey, Dad. - Dad. - Are you hurt? Dad, no, Dad, I'm fine.

Only if it's yours. Well, I mean, of course, you'll have to sleep in Ryan's bed. - Of course. - Yeah. We can, yeah... Oh, uh... almost forgot. You left this little guy. Thanks. You know what your little scenario reminds me of? What? - Uh... - What's that? Groundhog Day. The movie, Groundhog Day? I don't know. With Bill Murray? Who's Bill Murray? Are you kidding me?
