Ready? Sing. Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday... to you, my love - Let's blow! - Wait. Hold on! A souvenir. One, two, three... Look at me. Want a raspberry? - Umm, no. - Why not? - Put it to the side. - The candle. Take it off. From me. Thanks. A gourmet restaurant. - What's "gourmet"? - A very good restaurant. Great meal, great chef. Two Michelin stars. - It's more for you. - No, it'll be great. - Thanks a lot. - Happy? Yes! Let's dig in! Like it? It's not over. What's that? There's a surprise. What are the rings? Wedding bands. Daddy's asking me to marry him. What do you say? - Why now? - It's been 10 years. It's about time. So? Yes, of course... Yes. Sandwich kiss. You good? - Hey, kids! - Hey, Laurent. I'm more into a fat, juicy steak. Ready? You bet. I think he's dead. Let's get started. Obviously. ID. From Paris. Hotel room key. - That's it? - I'm done. Nothing else. Stephane Dallet. Suicide for sure. He'll give the death certificate to the coroner. I'll set it up with forensics. Thanks. How's your kid? Excellent! - Bye. - Thanks. Bye, Doctor. Remove the ones who throw stuff. Handcuff them, if you want, but no need to club them. That's bullshit. You may have 200, 300 cops up against an angry mob of 500, 600 even 1,000. - Gotta contain them. - Carole said it was peaceful. At the beginning. You never know who starts it. Exactly. You never know. The riot squad didn't hit firemen for no reason! No but... You saw the blast balls. Yeah, that's too much. Blast-balling firemen? - It's unbelievable! - They're just rubber bullets. Come on, rubber bullets. One guy lost an eye. "Just rubber, sorry." Spare me. There are investigations. If someone screwed up, he'll be sanctioned. Get the Paris police? They're notifying his family. I saw Manu, the so-called gardener. Looks like he's into hard stuff now. Like what? - Heroin? - I think so. - He doesn't get it. - He'll come to a bad end. Not a bad guy. Just needs a jolt. For sure. - Like a baby with a bottle! - It works well. A month already! Instead of half a pack, you smoke that all day. It's not better. Some scientists say it's worse than cigarettes. Later. He's pissed off. I think we annoyed him. Too bad. I can pay! That's not it. - Keep your money! - A tip! - Keep it. - Take your money. You drank enough. You drank enough. I'll spread the word. Fine! No threats. Come on, Jacques. I can walk by myself. So walk! Refusal to sell! - It's nothing, Mom! - Looking good! I did nothing. I went for a drink by foot! Look at yourself! She called the fucking cops! Out of my garden! - This is my house! - Calm down! Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep you posted. Come in. This one's good... That's all of it. I'll see to it. Sorry, but this is serious. Dudot just reported something. He sees a girl for asthma. Now she says she has stomachaches and that her father "hurt her hole". Give it top priority. Thanks, Carole. Relentlessly, the ocean wanderers set off for other latitudes. Tired? The great migrations follow the rhythm of the seasons. The sea is a huge, open space... 5 minutes till bedtime. You're up for a background check! What is it now? Gendarmes can't marry just anyone. They need to check your character. We've known each other so long. - Marriage means investigation? - It's the army. Put Poulette to bed. Séverine's on her way. She couldn't stop by City Hall. - This late? - It'll be quick, 15 minutes. One thing left. You're good. No, I'm not. Now I have to move them all. I can do it eyes closed. Ready? I'm not looking. There. It's your first request, so there's paperwork. After 5 years of speech therapy! Listen, your son needs it. Don't think twice. You saw the head teacher? What does she say? Maëlie, age 5. Daughter of Marc and Jessica. Jessica now lives with Christophe. Who is Marc's brother. Marc lives in a trailer in the garden. Jessica and Christophe have two kids. Célia and Aaron, Maëlie's half-siblings and her cousins. So there are 7 of them. Living conditions? 3-room house, totally filthy. The trailer's filthy too. We better keep a low profile. If they see a uniform, we're blown. They'll make the kids clam up. We'll frame it as a social case. A tip from the school: insalubrious housing. We take the kids and put the parents in custody. And the prosecutor? He's another problem. We'll figure it out. BOMB DISPOSAL Set them to channel 3. Hello, ma'am. We're doing mine-clearing. You'll have to leave the beach. Put your dog on a leash. - Will it last long? - Pretty long, sorry. Permission requested to arm the detonator. Permission granted. Circuit non-shunted. Detonator armed. Copy that. Countdown imminent. Five... four... three... two... one... Blast. The ta-ca ta-ca tactic of a gendarme Is to cleverly perceive but always act naive Pay your fine now, now Toe the line, now, now Don't be slow, now, now I am a real pro! The ta-ca ta-ca tactic of a gendarme Is to never overlook to play by the rule book We now move onto deep-sea fishermen. This is a traditional seaman chant. "You Need Courage". Feel free to join in. You need courage to make this long voyage It's that time on the clock Everyone, get on the dock - Fresh air! - It feels so good. There's a comoran there. - Over there, yeah. - Maybe we'll catch some fish. Is something biting? No, nothing. Not our lucky day. I have something to ask you. I'd like you... to be my best man. Really? - What an honor. - Yep. Well... sure. We'll throw a great party. For sure. Great couples, great parties. I brought this because we didn't catch a thing. How sweet of you. - I got you shrimp. - Thank you. - Maybe we should have... - A little drink? - In the kitchen, in the fridge. - White? I wanted to tell you... at my age, we're a little fragile. So if anything happens... You know what I mean. Stop scaring me. Come on, it's our fate. No one has... no one has discovered immortality yet. I don't even believe in the afterlife. That's another problem. But I'd like to give you something. All right. Something very dear to me, of course. We need to go have a look. It meant so much to your grandfather. He adored you. It must go to you. You love it, I can't. Nothing stops me from coming to see it. But I want you to start tending to it. Besides, you have no choice. It's for you. Go on. And I trust you to take excellent care of it. - Okay? - I have no choice. No. - What is it? - Look. The Albatros! Take this. Careful, very fragile! Foremast... Forestay. Inner jib, outer jib. And flying jib. Flying jib. Now you can sail. We'll circle the world, you and me. - I'm the captain. You? - Cabin girl. Cabin girl? Listen up: "Cabin girl!" Little cabin girl! Keep it up. There's lots of dust. In the tiny corners. Gently, so you don't damage it. This one. The big one. And... This one. - There. - All three? - Yep. - You sure? Of course. And you have the invoices? - No, but Sery must have them. - Better find them. If you remove the casing... my initials. Proof enough? Some coffee? How did you find it? Carrying out a search for something else. Who is it? I'll tell you later. Where are they from? I can't say for now. I know them? Julien, I can't say. Bruno your neighbor never filed a complaint. Was he robbed too? I didn't hear anything. But I know Savalle was. Tell him to come by. - I'll tell him. - To come see. I'll tell him. Any news about your complaint against the DDPP? What hypocrites. It eats away at me. They came. Everything went well. We spent the day visiting the farm. It was all fine. They left satisfied. I was too. And three weeks later, I get a letter saying I'm short 5 square meters a cow. It's not even true. Who are they to tell me how to raise cattle? My cows live better than me! Bunch of assholes. But listen up, they better not piss me off. They owe me 24,000 for going organic. We do everything they wanted. We adapt. 3 years now I'm waiting for aid. - 3 years my file is completed. - You're not alone. But European aid has nothing to do with a health inspection. For me it does. It's all the same. But hovering above it all is the bank. And that's much worse. I'm sick of the countryside. How about a gyro in town? See some people. - A gyro sounds great. - No, they're gross. - Not a meal. It's dogfood. - Come on. It's a change. Gyros... You know how they make that meat? No... You up for one? - There, two against one. - So gyros it is. Now we're talking. Seeing anyone, Carole? Nope. Not right now. No one? No boyfriend, no girlfriend? Don't want one? Yeah. Don't want a life with someone? Yeah, I do. As long as that someone doesn't want kids like me. But yeah. - Don't want kids? - No. Why not? Ever think what 2030 will be like? What can we offer kids? Worldwide extinction. Everything's on fire, melting. How long have scientists been warning us? What do politicians do? What's going on? How can we give hope, experience things, keep on having kids? If they close their eyes to it, like everyone else. I have a daughter. I need a little hope. I have to give her hope. Otherwise, I can't... I know, I get it, but... There's no more hope. Anyway, I don't want children. - All good? - Yeah, thanks. - What you doing here? - Just sleeping. - All good? - Yes, thanks. Great. Have a good night. So, Pierre Lemenan... 06 24 04 36 76. I have Olivier Mayor. "Mayor", funny. Yes, it's fitting. 06 24... 03... 13... 14. Perfect. - Now I can call. - They already know. Really? You already told them. - Yeah, I had to... - To what. To ask if they were fine with it. I didn't do that yet. Because you take time to do stuff. - Well... - Excuse us. I'm thrilled. Because locals with children who come back and restore homes is our dream. I'm doubly thrilled because Laurent and I meet regularly for much less pleasant business. Yeah, I'll say. So thanks for sharing this important life event with me. Lower. - The floor's better. - We can't, so lower it. - I'm fine. - You're too high. I'm all... No big deal. Same thing, 450. - Come here. - Same thing? Let go. I'm at 450. How much? 450. Write it down. - You left! - There... right here! There you go. Hold it. No, hold it. You moved! - Did not. - Did too. - I didn't. - You did again. 336. 336 and 450. No, honey, it's 450, not "400.50". So you write "450". What was here? 350 here. 350! 339? No, 350. The whole room comes to 49 square meters. - Amazing. - So 49 times 20 euros. Per square meter. - 50 times 20. - That's 1,000 euros. For all this? We need to insulate it all. - What? - There's a dead mouse. Must be the cats. Keep away. You didn't touch it? Let's finish this, please. It's just for one day. Exactly. I'll never wear it again. Waste of money. I want you to feel special. We're still renovating. I want it to be memorable. A white dress, after all these years? So get off-white, whatever. Get moving. I'll go to the wine shop. Call when you're done. A kiss, Mrs. Sandrail. Come on... Not yet. See you later. - Hello. - Hello, Miss. You have an appointment? Do I need one? No, it's fine. Go in that direction. Aurélie will help you. Hello, Miss. Aurélie. How can I help? I'm just looking. Do you have a date for the wedding? Look around. If you need help, just ask. That's perfect. I'll take your name, sir. Excellent. When is the wedding? The date's not set. Duly noted. At least one must have caught your eye. You know I hate shopping. This was a low point. But I'll find one. We don't have to get married. If you're not into it, if it's not something we share. Of course. Don't take it personally. I'll find something. I just have to be... pretty! You always are. That's not the problem. It just may take me a while. So? He won't come out with this ruckus. Not until the court decides on his cattle. He won't budge. Always stubborn as a mule. He has to come out, find a solution. I don't know what to do. Julien? It's Laurent. You have to come out. Let's go about this by the rules, okay? We're waiting for you. Julien! At it again? Still fucking with my cattle? That's all you have to do? How much you make a month? How much? Tell me! What are you paid to bust my balls? What do you make? Answer me! When you question me, I answer. I show you everything. Size of each building. Answer me! 350 euros a month! No Saturday, no Sunday, no vacations! Bust my balls again? So, how much? They're not treated well? Look! What more do you need? Assholes! Mr. Laforge. We just want each cow's passport and health record. Do as they say. Easy, you'll get addicted. A man thing. Not bad, not bad. I get it. Did you try? - You never smoked. - Nope. Nothing. Want a look? Here! Julien! Gendarmerie Squad 76. Etretat Unit. Copy that. We have a hit-and-run. Auberville-la-Renault. A white Toyota SUV. He took the rifle. I'm told he's armed. He wouldn't... He'll cool off. It'll be fine. Don't worry. The suspect is Julien Laforge. 35 years old, tall, blond dreadlocks. Good. Attempt to locate vehicle, potential suicide risk. I'll keep you posted. Seeing Séverine tomorrow? Julien has nowhere to go. It worries her. I didn't see it coming. He came by the station. I saw nothing. You'll find him soon. His cows are his life. This one's nice, right? I look awful. It's a family picture. Yeah, we'll take another. Has he ever run off without calling? No, never. With cattle, he has to be there all the time. We have to figure out why Julien left with a rifle. Did he ever threaten to shoot anyone? You know him! He's not mean. He's angry, that's all. He's fighting. He's a fighter. He's spent. He'd never hurt anyone. He's more likely to hurt himself. To threaten himself. "Likely to threaten himself." Does your family have a history of suicide? Did he ever mention ending things? No, never, not with me anyway. He hates when farmers kill themselves. He gets furious about how no one cares. My brother has a soft side. Yes, I know. Hello, Bruno! What's this about? You're milking Julien's cows? - We can't let them die. - Relax. Just here to talk. We're looking for Julien. We think he's in danger. When did you see him last? About a week ago. - Did he say anything? - Nothing special. His sister says he hasn't been well. He quit coming to meetings last year. He knows the DDPP never gives up. For sure. We're Julien's mediators. This time, they didn't warn us. This speaks for itself. Yep. I sent the pictures to the prosecutor. We'll depose them. I bring in the girl. Will you be with me? No. You're on your own. I trust you. It'll be fine. Have the Commander reserve the Melanie room. You'll be fine, okay? What's this? Found this kid. No helmet, tested positive for substances. We left his moped there. Where? Saint-Jouin roundabout, the deadly one. Know what happened there? - What? - Know what happened there 6 months ago? - Dunno. - Don't know, forgot? - Dunno. - Your pal, Kevin Lethuillier. He died there! No helmet, same as you! And we notify the parents? Hear them cry? What do we say? "Sorry, he had no helmet." Is it our fault? Is it? - Why you shouting? - So you understand! - Calm down. - You don't get it. How many kids have to die till one understands? If I were your father, I'd slap you. - You're not... - Good thing! Pace around a cell. Think it over. I call the parents. Understood. - Lucie's asleep? - Half an hour now. Any news about Julien? No, he's playing dead. Can't you put it differently? Two nights, not a sign. Stationing someone 24/7 at the farm isn't possible. We're doing our job. So butt out. I don't see progress being made. Do I ever mention the brains at the beach? The drunkards, couples who get into fist fights 3 times a week? Girls raped by their families? Corpses? The stench of a corpse, do I ever mention it? I leave it at the office. So spare me your remarks, please. When I'm home... I'm home! Got the code? We'll keep it. We're taking it. Of course. I'm upset with myself. I didn't see he was in such pain. It's very serious. Not your fault. His coming by is a good sign. I should have seen it. It's hard to see from within. You don't see everything. You're not alone. We'll find him. I promise. Get some rest. Goodbye. We can't use this? We never do. Don't know how it works. The instructions require a PhD. I'll have a look. Go on, enjoy. - Not that! - I promised Martine. A cruise is her dream. For our 20th anniversary. It's a floating skyscraper. Bars, restaurants, that's all... Everything you need. And not expensive. It's not the sea, not sailing. It's Disneyland. - You'd do that in good conscience? - It's to please my wife. What about ecologically? He's right. It's disgusting. It litters the seas. You're not invited, guys. - Rest assured. - You condone it. Go paddle-boating. We'll take a cruise. No need to justify myself! We need to subscribe to get live updates. Then we need the URL, the APN, and the IP address. It seems pretty simple. If you say so. No risk of it getting stolen? If we don't even try, no one will steal it. Maëlie hinted that her cousin Célia also slept with her father. She went back home after. I couldn't sleep a wink. Armor up. It's just the beginning. We need the father to admit to it. He's away. Comes back in 3 days. I'll summon him then. Good. It works. All set! While I'm here, can you check the nav lights? I'm looking for your house. From Newfoundland, Greenland... 6 months a year, during 2 trips, 3 months with no port of call. What I find amazing is they never saw flowers, buds... Not even leaves on trees. They'd travel 9 months and return for winter. The rest of the time they were at sea. But they saw snowdrops. It as if, in 6 years, you sailed for 9 months to Canada. I couldn't have gone. I'm a girl. That's true. Shall we continue? How old was Henri when he left? Henri, for his first outing, he was barely 13. Is he dead? Yes. Like your great-grandfather. A shipwreck. It's been 4 days. How does he get by? It's him. Head to the sector. Gendarmerie Squad 76. Etretat Unit. Copy that. We located Laforge at his farm. 339 route d'Epreville, Auberville. Copy that. Fecamp Unit, where are you? Be there in 15 minutes. We'll meet there. You okay? Why do you have a gun? Drop it. Let's talk. Leave. Leave. - We can't leave. - You can. We'll talk, find a solution. Put the gun down. Listen to me. What's this? We use it to count fowl. What do you want? Think I'm an animal? Leave. Julien, listen to me. Put that on the ground. No. Leave me alone. We can't. We'll find a solution. You'll pull through, Julien. There's no solution. It's over. Listen to me, put that down. It's not over. We'll work it out. You'll get by. - Put it down. - I'm tired. I'm tired. I know you're tired. But put down the gun. We'll go to your house, sit down and drink. We'll relax. It'll be fine. None of this matters. There's a solution. What you doing? Julien... don't be stupid. Put it down. Look at me, please. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Listen to be stupid. Put it down! People love you! Julien! Listen to me! Don't be stupid! Put it down! Look at me! Look at me! Put down the gun! Now! Julien, put it down! It's nothing serious. He's gushing blood! Don't move, Julien. Sergeant Sandrail. I shot someone. Where are you? 339 route d'Epreville. Auberville. Applying pressure? We're doing that. Try to apply a tourniquet. Go get the medical kit from the car. Hurry! There's lots of blood. Okay, I'm pressing. They're on their way. Fuck! What's he doing? Hurry! Julien, stay with me. It'll be fine. Here I am! He's gushing blood! Julien, stay with me. Stay with me, okay? - Tighten it! - I am! I'm pulling it tight! Help me, Laurent! Tighter, tighter! Fuck! I can't! Calm down. Like this... and that goes under. It'll be fine. What happened, guys? I shot. He had a gun to his head. He was gonna shoot. I shot his leg. We're here. Pull the tourniquet. Open your eyes! Breathe! Stay with me, goddammit! Breathe, breathe. A milligram of adrenaline. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Increase the drip. Another milligram. He lost 5 liters of blood. We won't bring him back. Did you increase the drip? One... two... We've lost him. It's over. We can stop. Death certificate with autopsy request. Negative, sir. Thanks. What happened, Sandrail? Can you describe what happened? He'd have killed himself? Did you feel in danger? I need to hear your version, Sandrail. Did you warn him? You totally lost control of the situation. It's gonna make waves. A fucking unholy mess. Laurent, you know the routine. I have no choice. I'm taking you into custody. You can call a doctor, a lawyer. Come with us. I'll take your gun belt. Laurent, your gun belt. Come on, let's go. Come, Laurent. Why did you think he'd kill himself? Tell me, Laurent. What made you think that? What? Why did you think he'd kill himself? Because he... he suddenly... put... his barrel under his jaw and... he had his finger on the trigger. I tried reasoning with him. And... I aimed for his thigh. All I wanted was for him to drop the gun. Okay. Why didn't you wait for the others? The idea was... not to go as a group. I know Julien... I mean... I don't know... I knew him. And... and we didn't want to scare him off. So I... I told our colleagues to stand by at the intersection between the farm... as usual. I... You put an alert out for him, potential suicide risk. Was that you? I can't remember. Yes, yes. After the hit-and-run. I think that's enough for now. We'll stop here. Counsel, any questions, observations? No, neither. I'm a gendarme. I know, Laurent. Don't worry. Let's take a break. Yeah. It all happened so fast. I... I took away his gun, kept him away. We starting applying pressure. He was still conscious. Did Sergeant Major Sandrail lose control? No... I lost my cool too. We were both panicking. We didn't know what move to make. We made a tourniquet but it was too late. There was so much blood... We couldn't tighten it enough. It was total confusion. After that... the paramedics came, but... it was too late. I feel guilty... about installing that camera. It was my idea. And it was a bad one. Laurent's wife. Hello, come in. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Gendarmes, murderers! Farmers are in pain! How many suicides a day? One suicide a day! Maybe two! Just last week, one of my friends killed himself. It's unacceptable! I'm a farmer and proud of it. We are France's first resource. Nowadays we're trampled on. No one respects us. Mr. President... listen to France... France's rurality, France's farmers... We've all had enough! Rurality is in deep shit. It's time for change. We are here today without Julien. Julien didn't decide to leave us. It's the gendarmes who made him leave us. That's unacceptable. We're here to get the truth. Europe is killing us. The gendarmes are pulling the trigger. What's this crap? We'll deal with it. He'll be indicted. Don't worry. Go see your daughter. Get some rest. Call if you need me. Thanks, Pierre. Come inside. Daddy's not here? He has to work late tonight. He'll be back tomorrow. Why can't I see him? It's tough now. Aren't we having fun? Bye, Poulette. Except for tomorrow, I'm free every day. Thanks, Carole. I'm tired. I'd never... I'd never shot anyone before. It's the first time I pulled out my gun. I wanted to save him. And I killed him. You're living something awful. It's unexpected. Violent. But you tried to save him. You did what you could. You need time, Laurent. That doctor put you on sick leave for ten days. That seems necessary. You can see your family. How does that make you feel? I don't know. Everything I'm going through... feels so unreal. I'm waiting to wake up. You're still in shock. A state of stunned paralysis. A reaction to the trauma. It's normal but hard to live. If you need another space to find yourself, the doctor can hospitalize you. No, I'm fine. You need rest. You ever have trouble sleeping? No... You may have nightmares that replay the scene. It's your brain negotiating with the unbearable. By repeating it. What matters most is to get rest. If it's too hard, ask for tranquilizers. And it's best not to stay alone. Can we stop now? Yes, it's time. I'll leave you my card. With my number. We're here for you, so don't hesitate. Thanks. Talk tomorrow. A mattress and blanket, if you want to sleep. It's okay? It went okay last night? You said a lot in custody. It's enough. But if you have anything to add... Go on. Having read your deposition and listened to your lawyer, I indict you for having - on October 27, 2019 - accidentally killed Mr. Julien Laforge. Involuntary manslaughter by someone in a position of public authority. That is, you. I ask that you be kept under supervision. With the impossibility to leave the country. You are forbidden to contact the opposing party. The family of the deceased. You'll be questioned as the investigation proceeds. That's all. Do you have any questions? Anything to add? No, Your Honor. Daddy! I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Don't worry, Daddy... Gendarmes murderers Thanks. The model is nice there. You found a good spot. I prefer Daddy's. I didn't have time. It's no big deal. Make an effort and eat. Lucas said Daddy's not a gendarme but a murderer. That was stupid. Daddy's job is to protect us. It was an accident, okay? Autopsy report There was no chance. Bullet trajectory, point of impact... It backs up your deposition. And Private Fouquet's. But Séverine Lemonnier is suing, backed by the Farmers' Union. There will be a trial. When you're ready to work again, you can join your unit or ask to be transferred. Your choice. Meanwhile, you can only work a desk job. Take the time you need. You're a good sergeant, Laurent. We believe in you. Get some rest. How are you? The funeral was packed. Is Bruno milking the cows? We're selling them. We'll rent out the land. What can I do with all that now? I need to understand, Marie. To know what was in his eyes. His last words. To know if he'd have done it. I need to see Laurent. That's impossible. He's forbidden to speak to you. It's procedure. Until when? I have no idea. I don't know how long it takes. Later on, my job will be to protect animals. Lucie, bedtime. Not now. Go to bed! It'll be fine. I promise. Come. Look at me. To: Squadron Leader Merle... Request to be discharged We can't locate him? He has no radio. These boats have radar. He has nothing. We can't go looking. No, Marie. He's an adult. He can disappear. It's his right. Well, not really. He can't leave the country. He broke the rule. He's doing something stupid! He wired his savings, 6,000, to Olivier. A guarantee for the boat. - Filing a complaint, Olivier? - Of course not. Once the prosecutor hears he resigned... either he'll summon him or not, if he's busy. Months can go by without anything happening. I'll have to report it. No choice. He can't do this. He's abandoning us. Don't hold it against him. And don't say that. He's not abandoning you. He's a good sailor, Laurent. From Fécamp to Le Havre, yeah. Deauville tops! What do I tell Poulette? Tell her the truth. You tell her... the truth, that's all. He's always had the sea in his veins, you know it. He needs it. Try to understand him. Be generous. He made it to St. Anne. Now, he's here... near the Atlantic. And he wants to go here. Newfoundland. That's really far. The ocean will console your father. So what does this taste like? It looks so gross. Fuck! Pain in the ass! Put it down. I'm tired... Pierre! Got any news? No, Marie. Listen, Marie, I don't know how to tell you... Now that Laurent sent in his resignation, you'll have to leave the housing. It's procedure. How long do I have? A month. I'll give you warning. We'll help you. We won't leave you alone. Finish? Wait, let me cut it. There's a big boat there. Anyway, I won't be far. I'll find a replacement. A replacement? If I have to, I'll text you. Inner jib, outer jib, flying jib... topsail. Forestay and staysail. I'm sick of that damn model. Laurent? Yes, it's me. Are you okay? Are you? Yes. I'm coming back.
