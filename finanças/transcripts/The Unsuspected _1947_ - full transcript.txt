Mr. Grandison's residence. Oh, hello there. Is my wandering husband home, by any chance? No. I haven't seen Oliver since lunch. I'm all alone here- Thursday, you know. Who? No... Oh, no... No. Please! Aaah! Hello, Roslyn? Hello, Roslyn! Hello? This is the operator. Your party's hung up. Shall I try them again? Did you get the house? What? Oh. Oh, no. No, there wasn't any answer. Let's get out of here. All right. Waiter? What time is it? About 9:30. I mean, exactly. Exactly 9:37. Waiter, if my husband does come, Tell him we've gone on to the Pelican Club. Yes, ma'am. Come along, lover. "Tragedy strikes again. " What? "Last week, Victor Grandison's" attractive young secretary, Roslyn Wright, committed suicide at the Grandison Estate in Croton, New York. "The genial commentator, long noted for his interest in mysteries," confesses that the tragedy has him completely baffled. "Mr. Grandison was doing his weekly mystery broadcast in the New York studio at the time of her death." Was our show that bad? Poor Roslyn. I liked her. I wonder why she did it. You'd better watch your step. Oh, don't worry about me. I shall die at The ripe old age of 90. With my grandchildren at my bedside... If I can find a grandfather for them. Stand by. On the nose. This is the United Motor Company... Starring your genial host, The renowned writer, art collector, and teller of strange tales... Victor Grandison. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Grandison speaking. Tonight, I bring you from the files. Of the nation's unsolved crimes the story of one of the most brutal and yet the most cunningly conceived murders ever committed, a murder of rare delicacy and wondrous ease that was called... suicide. Yes, suicide, the police called it, Yet the murderer walks among us... free. But is he really free? Can he escape from the evil that he has done? No. By day, it follows him like his shadow. At night, the cold hands of death awaken him from a thousand nightmares. And so, day and night, he is driven on, with the dead forever haunting him, pursuing him. Or perhaps he isn't running away, but is in hiding in some dark hole, listening with terror to the voice of his own conscience- a voice that tells him over and over that the hunter has become the hunted, that there's no escape for one who has committed... murder. They say that drowning men relive their lives in seconds. The guilty, too, relive their crimes a thousand times a day... At every unexpected sound, at every glance that turns their way, and at a thousand fears that have no form. The guilty must go on and on, Hiding his evil behind a mask- The calm and often smiling mask of the unsuspected. Yes, the unsuspected is anywhere, everywhere... So be on your guard. He might be the man who calls you "Friend," who visits frequently at your home. He might even be someone who comes often to my own home. And while I pride myself on being an amateur detective, Even I might easily be fooled. And yet, his day of reckoning must come. He is tormented by fear... That someday he will make one false move, one slip, That will betray him. And when he does, the lightning Of justice will strike... the unsuspected. Victor's the only man I know. That can turn my blood to ice water. Let's have another drink. We could all be Murderers! Check the glasses, Kent, and open up some more wine. Some more wine. Hello, Mary. Oh, professor! Dr. Edelman, I'm so glad you could come. It's thrilling having a psychiatrist here. It's very difficult to think of you professionally, Mrs. Keane. Just don't open up all our secret doors. What's hidden behind yours, Althea? Ghosts? No, Mr. Donovan. There's nothing a ghost could do for me. Let me know when Mr. Grandison gets here, will you, please? Yes, miss. Uh, don't drink too much. Oh, excuse me. Louder and gayer, Lover! * I like your style * * Say, I think it's marvelous * Good evening, sir. Good evening. Excuse me, madam. There's a gentleman... Oh, thank you. Pardon me, lover. It's the most thrilling party! Having fun? Oh, yes! Good evening. I'm- Yes, I know. You're Victor Grandison's niece, Mrs. Oliver Keane. Althea. My name is Howard- Steven Howard. I have some bags in the cab. Bags, sir? But, uh - yes, sir. You brought luggage? Do you plan to stay? Obviously. I'm here to see Mr. Grandison. What do you want to see Mr. Grandison about? Quite a large party, isn't it? Would you care to meet anyone? No. Not very appetizing. It's Victor's birthday. Once a year, his friends crawl out of the woodwork. This year, it's a surprise party. Will he be surprised to see you? I like matches. You never have to refill them. And when you're through with them, you simply throw them away... Like people. Why hasn't Victor asked you here before? Probably because we've never met. He's not expecting you? You're a very curious woman, aren't you, Mrs. Keane? You are going to tell me. Maybe. What will you trade? A drink? Brandy. Thank you. You glued to this spot? Home is where the heart is. Very amusing. You're drinking too much, as usual. How much, my love, is too much? Regard my excellent balance. Look, no hands! My mind lose its razor edge? Do I slur my words? Do I forget anything? Not a single, solitary thing of all the things I'd give so much to forget. No, I'm still conscious. Therefore, my sweet, far from having had too much, I've not had enough yet. The least you could do is stay sober. While we have guests in the house. I'd then be free to dwell on our sacred marriage vows, Which you, my love, hold in such light esteem. Oliver, you talk too much. I'll be quiet. I'll just sit and bask in cowardly splendor. "Thus, conscience doth make cowards of us all." Here. Thank you. You seem interested. Fascinated. You know, it's very much like Mateo in his middle period. Who painted it? My husband, in his sober period... Before he married me. It's lovely. It's so alive. She's dead. Matilda Frazier, Victor's ward. She was on the freighter that was burned at sea last month. And Victor's secretary committed suicide last week. There's no connection. I didn't say there was. She was beautiful. She drank too much milk and her seams were always straight. You didn't like her. Frankly, she bored me. She was sweet, shy, unforgettable. I can understand why you didn't like her. You knew Matilda? I was married to her. Don't drop that. Now you know what I'm doing here... And I've earned this. Oh... That's impossible. Is it? She was in love with- With your husband Oliver. She told me-that and other things... That you married him just a few days before she was supposed to. I know quite a lot about you, Althea... Quite a lot. Man: Quiet, everybody. Here he comes now. Surprise! Who thought up this torture? Oh, Victor, dear, you are surprised, aren't you? Horribly. You see, we did remember your birthday. My dear, I've been trying to Forget it for the last 20 years. Happy returns! Oh, Victor! Happy birthday, Victor. There's the lord of the manor now. This will be quite A surprise party for Victor when he discovers you and Matilda were married. I'll tell him myself... Later. And deny me that pleasure? I doubt if you deny Yourself many things. I generally get what I want. Good evening, miss Moynihan. Good evening. Oh, look at them. A cork pops for free, and they all swarm like locusts. We thought you weren't coming, Jane. Oh, I generally get places... After driving Victor there and parking his car, and- Well, you see, I'm all things to victor... Except a woman. Why, Donovan, I'm delighted to see you, and surprised. You look like a fish out of water. You were the bait. Yes. Where is that treacherous niece of mine? Althea? Happy birthday, my darling! My dear, this is all very lovely, But why a party at a time like this? This is like dancing on their graves. Oh, I'm sorry, Victor. I thought it might help you forget. Well, will you do something for me? Take that pianist out and have him shot. All right. Happy birthday! Now, what's this? Sweets, to coin a phrase, for the sweet. My dear, it's a monstrosity. Why, it's just a plain birthday cake- Not even a hidden sword. Come on, Make a wish. Yeah, Make a wish! Thinking of stealing it? Why not something more practical? I, uh, I was curious about the chandelier. You're not the first to be curious about that chandelier. It was Mr. Grandison's secretary who was found hanging from it. And then the police evinced great interest when they cut her down. I read the papers. It must have been a shock to Mr. Grandison. More, I imagine, to the young woman. But then, of course, no smart girl would be found. Hanging around a Bachelor's private study. I can get along without any humorous remarks. Will you please get out? I beg your pardon? I said, please get out. Surely. Hope to see you before your next birthday. No more birthdays. Grand party, Victor. Had a wonderful time. I had a good time myself, thank you. Oh, Jane, won't you stay the night? I want to begin work early in the morning. Good night, Victor. Sleep in the country with the frogs chirping or whatever they do? No, thanks, darling. I'm going back to civilization. Goodbye. Good luck. Good night. Give my love to that small daughter of yours. Ok. Thank you. The nicest thing about guests is their departure. Arrivederci! Oh, listen, you're not going. What about the data on that Woodward case? I have it here, but aren't you tired? Tired? After a social evening, Nothing cheers me up as much as a nice, gory murder. Come on, let's see what you got. Right in there. I'm perfectly all right. Perfectly All right. Yes, sir. Put him to bed. To bed. Yes, madam. Be gentle with me, Kent. When I'm in this condition, I tip over very easily. Very easily. Yes, sir. Hmm. Let's go inside. Coming. Let me see... This was a hatchet murder, wasn't it? That's right. Tiny little thing, Isn't she? Well, there's only half of her there. Yeah. Who's this? That's the murderer. This good-looking young boy? Criminals don't run true to type, Victor. You know that. The most dangerous of all is some charming young killer. That no one will ever suspect- "Pretty Boy" Floyd, for instance. Uh-huh. Victor. Victor, there's something I think you ought to know. Oh, I know. I saw Oliver. I can only suggest that you keep him away from any open flame. It isn't Oliver. Have you noticed a young man around here with very bad manners? I think you'll find him in your study. In my study? Good evening, Mr. Grandison. Were you looking for me? Hello, sir. Are you a late guest for the party. Or an early arrival for breakfast? Neither. This is Mr. Howard, Victor. I'm delighted to meet you, Mr. Howard. Now, if you don't mind, Mr. Donovan and I have things to talk about. Victor, I think you ought to talk to Mr. Howard. He and Matilda were married. Married? You and Matilda were married? To each other. Really? When? 3 days before the accident. I see. Oh, please sit down, Mr. Howard. Perhaps I'd better- No, no, don't go. I'd rather you stayed. This is Mr. Donovan. We've met. Casually. Do sit down. You have proof Of what you say? Of course. You sound suspicious. Merely concerned. Matilda was very dear to us. And to me, too, but I hardly expected this kind of welcome. Well, I... We can't help being curious. At this sudden appearance... Just as Matilda's estate is to be legally settled. So you think I want Matilda's money. It's a rather large sum- Runs into millions, as you undoubtedly know. That's the one thing I didn't know. We met, and a few days later, we were married. I had to leave for Lisbon. Matilda was to follow by boat. When I learned the boat had gone down, I came back. You see, I thought I could find something here. That would make not having her... A little more bearable. What, for example? This picture. It's all I want. I'm not interested in the money. I happen to have money of my own. Quite a bit of money. How lovely. I'm afraid I've been in error, sir. You shall have the picture... And with it, our most heartfelt welcome. I loved Matilda, and anyone she loves would necessarily be very close to me. So you will stay with us tonight? If I may. Of course you may. We'll talk some more tomorrow. Will you make him comfortable, my dear? Yes, I will. I'll take him to the guesthouse. Fine. Good night. Good night. Good night, sir. I hope you like it. It's decorated in Early American. Do you like Early American? Extraordinary, most extraordinary... But do you know I don't believe a word he said? Sounded too much like the truth to be true. Might be interesting to know a good deal more about that young man. That might cost you a little money. I've discovered that everything worthwhile costs a little money. Good night, Victor. Good night. It's been a very interesting evening. Mm-hmm. Yes, well... Victor: "It is difficult now" to pierce the mists of time that obscure what Charles Woodward was thinking when he struck his light of love that fateful blow, but if we may conjecture, it is not too much to assume that his thoughts may have turned back to that lovely Spring day when first they met, "and their adolescent passion flared into its brief breing." Being, being, being! Silly word. Silly script. Turn it off, Jane. Want to hear it played back? No, thank you. I'll listen to it later. It's much too nice a day for murder. What's wrong, Victor? You've lost all your zip. You're as limp as an old girdle. I don't know what's the matter with me. The last few days, I've had a curious premonition. As though something were going to happen- Something unpleasant. I had that feeling once, but I married him anyway. Here, run your pretty blue eyes over next week's material. You know, it's a sort of throbbing in the air... A feeling of inevitability, like... Like, uh... Falling in love-a vibration. You probably wouldn't remember. I'll have you know I've vibrated in my time. Once, In Kansas City, I- Oh, well, no use living in the past... But for 6 months, I vibrated like a musical saw. I beg your pardon, sir. Mr. Donovan, sir... Huh? He's in the library, sir. Oh, good. That'll be all, Jane. Hi, Donovan. I'm delighted to see you. I've been waiting impatiently for you. Will you sit down? Of course. Jane... I'll go quietly, only this shoe is choking me. Well, what did you find out? I didn't have much to go on except his name. Steven Francis Howard. Born April 12, 1913. His father was Francis J. Howard. Does that suggest anything to you? Oil. Yes, quite a lot of oil. Mr. Howard is well-equipped. With pin money, just as he said. 31/2 years in the army- He's a captain- Wounded twice, discharged early in May at fort Dixon. Went straight to New York, where he stayed at the Sherry Central. Same time Matilda was there. A week later, he went to Lisbon. His story checks all along the line, Victor. Cablegram. I'll take it. It's for Mr. Grandison. I'm Mr. Grandison. You want me to check on anything else, let me know. Thank you very much, and goodbye. Goodbye, Victor. I'm sorry. I love it. Mercury on a bicycle just brought this. Oh. Hmm. "Aren't you going to open It?" said she, eagerly. What? Aren't you going to- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was thinking of something else. Uh... Do you, uh, happen to know where Mr. Howard is? No, but Althea usually keeps in touch with him, And the last I saw of her, she was headed to the guesthouse... Vibrating. Does it always take you so long to make a move? I like to be perfectly sure of what I'm doing. Were you sure when you married Matilda? I was. She wasn't. Oh. How interesting. How long were you married? I don't suppose you could call it a marriage. There was a wedding ceremony. I had to leave the same day. That's why you think you love her- You haven't been disillusioned. Speaking from experience? You've met Oliver. I beg your pardon. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Oh, no, Victor. We've been looking everyplace for you. Really? You've been playing chess, too. Tell me, is he a good player? Steven's an expert. Mm-hmm. Interesting situation. I'm afraid you're going to lose, my dear. We'll see. Have a drink. No, thanks. I came down here because I have what I think will be very good news for you. You mean, no discrepancies. In your check-up on my story? No discrepancies... But you didn't finish your story. There's an end to it... Or, rather, a second beginning. What do you mean? She's alive. Who? Matilda. I don't believe it! Alive and well and on her way home. I suppose she sent this to me. Because she didn't know where to reach you. Seems that our sorrow was a little premature. "Leaving Rio today. Arrive... Tomorrow." She arrives tomorrow. That's right. We'll all go down to meet her, banners flying, with a large, noisy band. That won't be necessary. I'll meet her alone. That's my privilege. That's a familiar cue- Enter Matilda, exit Althea. I'll buy that drink now, if you don't mind. Help yourself. It isn't every day a man's wife comes back from the grave. No. I believe you're in considerable trouble. Check and mate In 3. Good luck. Man, over loudspeaker: Flight number 7 from Rio De Janeiro. Landing at gate 3. Man: Hey, what's she doing taking a trip at a time like this, anyway? Second man: What else would she do with all of her dough? Well, she could give it to me. No sign of Grandison yet. You'd think he'd be here to cash in on that publicity. Let's go! There she is. Get a good shot of her, Joe. Don't crowd her. How about a story, miss Frazier? Don't spare the details, miss Frazier. Give us the whole story. Was it a terrible experience? Come on, let's have that story! Must have been very exciting. What happened? How does it feel to be dead? Won't you please- Were you afraid when the ship caught fire? We understand you were picked up by a fish trawler. Is that right? Yes. It took us 3 weeks to get to brazil. Why didn't you send word you were still alive? The boat that rescued us had no radio. Break it up. Can't you see... Wait a minute! We've got a story here! How about your plans for the future? Victor let me come to meet you. When can we get a complete statement? We'll give you a statement later. Let's get out of here. Feeling better? Yes, thank you. But after all that's happened, I can't understand why Grandy wasn't there. He's all right, isn't he? He's fine. He wanted to meet you, But he thought it would only complicate the publicity. You know Victor and the press. We'll stop off and phone him later. Oh, good. You haven't changed. You're as beautiful as ever. Well, that's very kind of you. You know, I'm afraid I didn't get your name. I'm terribly sorry. I probably should have remembered, but I- Matilda, what is this? You know who I am. I've never seen you before in my life. Croton operator? 48305, please. A vermouth cassis for the lady. How do you know that? That's right, isn't it? Brandy for me. Yes, sir, brandy. Hello? Mr. Grandison, please. Is that Roslyn? No, it's Jane Moynihan. Hello, sir. This is Steve Howard. Yes, she's here with me. Oh, Grandy, darling! Of course I'm well. I am happy. I'm so anxious to see you. Tell Steven to bring you home. Mm-hmm. We'll warm up a fatted calf for you. All right. Goodbye, darling. There you are, sir. You're pretty sold On Victor, aren't you? He's the kindest, most unselfish man I've ever known. Yes, I know. I like him, too. I like him even more for what he means to you. Course, I can't say the same thing about Althea or Oliver, Although I think he regrets the way he treated you. I didn't know anyone knew about that. Why shouldn't I? You know, it must've been pretty horrible for you- The trouble with Oliver, the bitterness, the wedding, and after that, a shipwreck. I can understand why you're so confused. About what? In the car. Don't you remember? You told me you'd never seen me before. I don't anything hurt quite as much. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. Please forgive me. You handed me quite a scare. I realize we didn't see much of each other, But I couldn't believe it meant so little to you that you'd completely forgotten me. Just your name. Is something wrong? Yes. Something's very definitely wrong. If you don't remember my name. Howard. Steven Howard. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Afraid not. We must have met somewhere. You wouldn't be so sure. But I don't quite remember. You don't remember me At all? I'm sorry. All those weeks In brazil. Before you let anyone know you were alive... Why? What happened to you? Why should you think something happened to me? You were ill, weren't you? Very ill. Well, yes. I was suffering from exposure and shock, if- Only that, or was there something more? You had a nervous breakdown, didn't you? Didn't you? Yes. That explains it- amnesia and shock. I should have known when you told me about Oliver. I didn't tell you about Oliver. Yes, you did. At this hotel, at this very table. This is where we met, Matilda. You've forgotten. Why should I forget when there's nothing to remember? No? Not even our marriage? Marriage?! You're my wife, Matilda. Well, that's impossible. You're Mrs. Steven Howard. Here's our wedding certificate. It's a forgery, and you're lying. Why should I? You know that better than I do. Perhaps because my father left me a fortune. So did mine. Shall we compare checkbooks? No, it had nothing to do With your money. I married you Because I loved you. I know I was very ill, but They said it was hysteria. I remember everything that happened. The shipwreck, Oliver... If I married you, why should I forget that and nothing else? Probably because you wanted to. You weren't in love with me. I knew that when we were married. But I only-It isn't important. You obviously regret having married me. But I didn't marry you! Waiter... Yes, sir? Thank you, sir. Didn't you like your Cassie, Mrs. Howard? You bribed him to say that! Well, there's no use going on with this. If you don't remember, or won't, that's all there is to it. I'll take you home, and that's the last you'll see of me. I don't suppose you remember this, either. Should I? We were on our way to be married. We took the next turnoff. Take it now. I'd like to meet the man you say married us. How do you do? Could you tell me If- My dear! We read in the paper that you were safe. How very kind and thoughtful of you to come here, Mrs. Howard. But, you see, I'm not Mrs. Howard. My wife would like to see Judge Maynard, if she may. Of course. Come right in. You can wait right in here. The judge is performing. A wedding service in the study, but of course you remember. You've seen me before? I never forget a bride, No matter how many I've seen. Just a moment. I'll tell the judge you're here. But it's a mistake! It must be! Well, we were married. There's no mistake about that. But I'm afraid I rushed you into it, and I shouldn't have. But I don't understand! Why can't I remember? Oh, my! Well, goodbye! Thank you so much. Goodbye! My dear, I'm so happy you're safe. But you couldn't possibly know who- My wife's been under a great strain, judge. She doesn't remember. There seems to be some doubt in her mind. Whether our marriage was The right thing or not. I see. If there's anything I can do... Perhaps there is, sir. In a few days, after you get everything straightened out, We'll get an annulment If you want to. Judge Maynard will help. Of course. I'll do anything I can. You're very kind. I'm very grateful to you for being so patient with me. It's all right, Matilda. I'll take you home. Goodbye. You got to stop it, Mr. Grandison. I can't take any more! I wouldn't entertain any awkward ideas about hastening my departure from the scheme of things if I were you, press. You got to leave me alone! Will you please stop trying to convince yourself that you have enough courage to murder me? And give me that ridiculous weapon. Give it to me, I say, before I lose my temper... A thing I detest. I can't sleep, I can't eat. Not since that broadcast... When you called me "The unsuspected." How do you think I felt? Well, if I were in your shoes, I should feel extremely uncomfortable. Now, for the good of your soul, I want you to hear something. Come along with me. For many years now, I've been recording my programs. Before broadcasting them- Just for practice purposes- So that my listeners would have the benefit. Of every full, rich tone. Now, occasionally, this device has other uses, one of which I now commend to your attention. Press, on recording: I swear, Mr. Grandison, I didn't mean to kill her. I was only threatening her when she screamed. Victor, on recording: But you were overzealous, press. Why didn't you tell the police? Press, on recording: I didn't dare. Victor, on recording: Why are you confessing to me? Press, on recording: Because I... Where did you Get that? I made it... On the occasion of your first visit. The microphone was hidden as you told me your story, So it turned out to be one of my best programs... For which I'm properly grateful. How very untidy of you... And so impetuous. Now, you don't really imagine that I'd be foolish enough to let you destroy the only copy, do you? There are others. And if anything ever happens to me, the police will be listening to one of them. Why don't you leave me alone? I intend to. I work for my material. I have to call on many different kinds of people at many different times. What is it you want from me? Nothing, actually. My interest in you is largely clinical. I am wondering, though, how long it will take the police to arrive at the same conclusions that led me to you. I could help them. I may have to. I could kill you! What good would that do? Here. And no more of that silly business. Goodbye. And don't come here again. I'll call you if I need you. You know, press, I rather enjoy playing God. That's strange. I thought I saw somebody. We'd better get in out of the rain. Oh, please, not the front door. I don't feel quite up to facing the others just yet. There's an outside stairway leading up to my room. I can slip in without anyone knowing it. Please explain to Victor. Tell him I'll talk to him in a little while. Althea: Well, darling... You completely missed the welcome mat we put out for you. Why, Althea, I- I was just putting on a suitable face for your triumphal return. I didn't expect to find you here. Well, welcome home anyway, darling. You look as though you'd been fished out of several oceans. I need a little time to pull myself together. I'm afraid you'll have a long pull. I took your room over Because... Naturally, of course, we didn't think you were going to come back. I suppose you'll want me to leave now. I really don't care. Oh. Well, in that case, You'll find all of your things in my room. Oh, tell me one thing, darling. No, not about the shipwreck. I read enough about that in the newspapers. What I want to know is, how did you ever manage to catch a man like Steve Howard? We always thought of you as such a quiet little mouse, and here you go and fool us all by snaring a millionaire husband. He isn't-a millionaire? Oh, yes. Trust Victor to check on his financial background. Isn't it rather unfair... You, with all the money in the world, and you marry more. And look at Oliver and me. Nobody ever left us a fortune, Neither one of us with a penny of our own. All we've got is each other. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not looking at you. I'm seeing you for the first time. You think I'm jealous. Why should you be? I would never have met Steven Howard if you hadn't taken Oliver away from me. If you are going to leave, perhaps you'd better go now. You'll probably want a hot bath before dinner. Yes, I do want a bath... But I'll take it here, in my own room. But you just said- I've changed my mind, Althea... About many things. You can move your clothes out after dinner. May I suggest you take a very hot bath? I thought it was amnesia at first. Now I'm not so sure. Either Matilda can't or won't remember our marriage. You seem to be confronted with an awkward. And somewhat delicate situation. What do I do? Divorce? Annulment? Do I stay or do I go? I think the wisest thing to do is to stay. Perhaps, in time, she'll remember. Meanwhile, as I understand it, your marriage was merely... Legal. I would suggest, then, that you remain on with us for the time being... In the guesthouse. Naturally. Good evening, Victor. Jane. You must be miss Moynihan. I am, but must I be? I'm Steve Howard. Will you join me in a cocktail, Mr. Howard? I'd much rather be together when I'm drinking. You appeal to my Chivalry, miss Moynihan. I shall regard that as definite encouragement, Mr. Howard. After slaving all day over a hot typewriter, There's nothing I like better than a swan dive into a bottle of bourbon. Why, Oliver! Waiting for the bar to open? No, I'm just sitting here in the dark, counting my sins. Without an adding machine? You mustn't be unpleasant, Jane. It has absolutely no effect. She's back, isn't she? Matilda? Is she happy? Or do you mean, has she forgotten you? I'm selfish enough to hope she hasn't. Oh, you men, you dogs in the manger. I'm not thinking about myself. I'm thinking about Matilda. She doesn't deserve to be hurt twice, And she's no match for Althea. Mr. Howard, do you think you could manage to make yourself. A little less attractive to my wife? Try being nasty. I have. Try harder. I don't- Oliver, if you ask me, Althea should be taken out regularly. And beaten like a rug. Who is it? Oh, Grandy! There, there, there... Angel, you're home, you're safe, And we're never going to let you get lost again. You're crying? Now, now, now, don't cry. Don't cry. I can't help it. I'm so mixed up. But you always were mixed up, my dear, And we've always straightened things out for you. I should've stayed away. I should never have come back. Not come back here? But this is your home. Your father's house. I never forget it... Though I'm afraid Althea and I do sometimes take advantage. Oh, not you, Grandy, never. But Althea- Now, you mustn't blame Althea for marrying Oliver. She was in love with him. Course, I know what a blow. It must have been to your pride. It was more than pride. I was in love with him. Mm-hmm. Well, I think you'll feel. Very differently when you see him. He's changed, my dear... And not for the better. And, of course, now that you're Mrs. Steven Howard- Grandy, what do you know about Steven Howard? That was going to be my question. He tells me you don't remember marrying him. In fact, he says you don't remember him at all. But I don't. I didn't marry him. I don't think I did. I'm sure I'd remember. I'm sure you would, too. Unless... Grandy, it couldn't have been amnesia. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. I think amnesia's a very convenient word. For covering up things we want to forget. And I think Mr. Howard's a very clever young man. Who has gone to a great deal of trouble. To make you believe you're married to him. But why should he? When we know the answer to that, my dear, We'll know how to deal with him. What can we do? Nothing. Just play along with him... For the present. We'll keep this to ourselves, shall we? Imagine what the newspapers would do with it. When the time comes, I'll know how to cope with him. Now, are you going to get your hair fixed before coming down to dinner? Grandy, would you mind terribly. If I didn't come down tonight? I'm so tired. Of course you are. You know, this house was lonely for you. It seemed so gray and depressing while you were gone. Now it's bright. You're alive again. So am I. Sleep well. Thank you. May I inquire where you've been? I'm sorry, sir. I mean. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't know you were up, sir. Mr. Howard asked me to drive him to the station. At this hour of the morning? He wanted to catch The 7:15. Only thieves and home-going Casanovas catch the 7:15 train in the morning. Well, he took it. Did he take any luggage with him? No, sir. No luggage, sir. Did you want something, sir? Breakfast, if it isn't asking too much. Asking too much. Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir. Kent: Yes, sir. Sorry I was late. I always have more face to put on in the morning. Drive on, please. Did Victor See you leave? I don't think so. What about your reporter friend? Did he come through? Yeah. He got these out of the file. Good. I'll deliver them myself. How about the phone company? You were right. I checked. You've certainly been a big help, Jane. I'll do all I can, Steve. We're going through with it just as we planned. You'll be at the house tonight? Mm-hmm. Fine. If I don't get back in time for dinner, I'll phone Victor my apologies. Please be careful. I will. I'm afraid he's suspicious. Why? I told him Matilda didn't recognize me. Naturally, he liked that. Of course. A husband to share his ward's millions. Is the last thing he wants. Did you bring that letter Roslyn wrote you? Yes. I put it in my bag this morning. Written the day before she died. Doesn't sound much like a girl who was tired of living, does it? Oh, you don't have to sell me, Steve. I know as well as you do that Roslyn never committed suicide. Matilda. It's nice to see you again, Oliver. Nice? Is that all it means to you? What did you expect? Why, Matilda, what a lovely gown. Hello, Althea. Thank you. I bought it in Rio. Oh. Grandy! If that's a Brazilian gown, I'll leave for Argentina tomorrow. Well, our sleeping beauty has awakened at last. You look radiant, my lamb, but then, you should, Having slept the clock round. I needed the rest to face tonight. I'm sorry I was so silly, but ever since I knew I was coming home, I've dreaded this moment. And what about now? It's the first time I've felt at ease... As though I belonged here. Of course you belong here. Cheers. Come along, my dear. We have a vermouth cassis for you. Hello, Nancy. Welcome home, miss. Good evening, Kent. It's nice to have you back, miss Matilda. Why, thank you. We missed you while you were dead. I know what you mean. Uh, uh, don't... move, my dear. Do you know you've changed? I have? Oliver: No, Matilda hasn't changed... The painting has. It just died. Oh... I haven't seen Roslyn yet. Oh, hello, Ro- Well, hello, Jane. Hello, darling. You look wonderful. Would a shipwreck do that for me? Every girl should have one at least twice a year. I thought you were Roslyn. I've been making a few changes in Victor's script. Our writers have been shipwrecked for some time now. Thought I'd finish it before dinner sets in. It's good to see you. Where is Roslyn? You haven't heard? Heard? What? Roslyn's dead. She was found hanging from that chandelier. Oh, no! Oh, no! Jane: Hello? Yes, just a moment, please. Victor... telephone. Here. Thank you. Hello? Victor? Sorry to disturb you. I'd like very much to see you. My dear fellow, I'm on the verge of dining. After dinner, then. I'm afraid I must insist. I'm sorry. It's very important. Very well, if you're going to be unpleasant about it. Come along at 9:00. I'll give you some poisoned coffee. Good. I'll see you then. You want to keep her letter? No. No, I think I have everything I need right here. Bring me the file on the Roslyn Wright suicide. Ok, chief. One of the newspapers took this picture. You were standing here, in front of the electric clock. Victor: I don't understand. Look what time the clock says in the picture. 9:35. What does that mean? The way we figure it, there was a struggle. This lamp was knocked over. That caused a short circuit and blew out a fuse downstairs. That stopped the clock and gives us the exact time of her death. Why is that so important? Everything's important. Take these books. The murderer arranged them so that we'd think. That Roslyn had used them to reach the chandelier. Mystery of the Headless Corpse. I read that. That's not bad. Quite a good detective in it. Uh, go on. Hmm? Oh, yes. Well, now we come to the point. The phone company keeps a record. Of all long-distance calls. At exactly 9:34 that night, A call was put through from New York to this phone. Roslyn answered it. That means she must have seen the murderer. Now, what we want to know is, Why haven't we heard from whoever put through that call? And most important of all... Who hung up this phone? Of course. Roslyn couldn't have done it. Right. Very extraordinary. Do you know, I think you've discovered. Something terribly important. Why, it changes the entire complexion of the case. How did you manage to discover this information? Victor, you know how thorough our department is. Well, I certainly hope you run this down. Poor child. Whatever could have been the motive? When we know that, we'll know who killed her. Matilda. I didn't mean to frighten you. You think you can keep avoiding me forever? Oh, Oliver, I'm not avoiding you. There's so much I want to say to you. I've got to say to you. Look at me, Matilda. You know, once, I wouldn't have. Been able to look at you... Without remembering. Now it doesn't seem to matter. Victor is right. You have changed. And you, Oliver? Are you the same ambitious young man who was going to change the course of history? Or are you- a drunk? Is that what you're trying to say? It isn't important now. It is to me. Tonight when I saw you, I realized what I've been running away from all this time. I love you. I always have. Doesn't that mean anything to you? I'm sorry. Is it because you're married? Because you're in love with Steve Howard? Yes... Maybe that is what I mean. Hello. Good evening. Do you mind if we have a look in the cellar? I'd like to check on the fuse system. You know the way. I don't expect to find anything, But it won't hurt to look. Well, Victor, you finally have. A murder case in your own home. Yes. Murder?! What did he mean? My dear... Tell me, Grandy! What is it? Roslyn didn't Kill herself. She was murdered. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's right through here and down the stairs. I'll get the light. Watch your step. Mm-hmm. Boy, look at all that vino. You watch your step. You know, when I was in Okinawa, We went down in one of those Jap cellars. Yeah? Yeah. Right over here. Living room... Seems to work. Library... But why? What reason could anyone have? I don't suppose we'll ever know, poor child. I'm afraid this hasn't been a very happy homecoming. Oh, make them stop! Make them stop! There, there... Oh, it's just coming home... And now this. I know, my dear. It's all been too much for you. Come along. Come along. Kent, do you ever cheat at solitaire? Cheat? Oh, no, miss. I do, and I hate myself for it. Oh... There it goes again. I wonder what's wrong with the lights? Nothing. You're going blind. Uh, blind- Blind? Well, Victor... Hmm? Oh... Yeah, you've been down in the cellar, haven't you? What did you find? Nothing of any importance. Before we go, we'd like to talk to Althea. Oh, she's out with Mr. Howard. Modern marriage is beyond me. Well, ask her to drop in my office in the morning. There are one or two things I'd like to talk to her about. Of course, yes. By the way, Victor, it's purely routine, of course, But where were you the night of Roslyn's murder? Doing my broadcast- "The Morgan Affair." Don't you remember? You gave me the- Now, don't tell me that you weren't listening. That's the one I missed. What train did you take that night. The 8:30 or the 9:00? My dear fellow, it's very obvious that you've missed. More than one of my broadcasts, Or you'd know that I'm not off the air until 8:30. I always catch the later train. That doesn't get here until 9:55. 10 minutes from the station to here... Means you got home At 10:05. Very precise. Why is this so- Oh, I see. Yes. This establishes my alibi. I don't think you needed it very much, But it's good to have things settled. Mr. Donovan, do you mind driving me in? I'm afraid to go home alone. You'll be quite safe with us. That's what I was afraid of. Good night, Victor. Good night. Jane: I'm always missing that train, but I do meet interesting people hitchhiking this way. It's not very flattering. Been looking at your watch all evening. Sorry. You know, you implied a great deal. When you asked me to come out here. What's the matter? Have you changed your mind? No, I haven't changed my mind. You're a funny guy, Steve. Am I? Been a long time since I met anyone. That interested me half as much as you do, And that's a gross understatement. You need a drink. No, Oliver. Let me take care of this. You go back to the house and wait for me. Go on. Do as I say. Oh, come on, Steve. Come on and sit down beside me. I'm lonely-terribly lonely. Bored, maybe. Bored and lonely. You think because I live in this house, Basking in Victor's glory and Matilda's money, that I like it. I hate it! I like to break things. Glass breaking is the most wonderful sound in the whole world. Why don't you like Matilda? She's been very kind to you. Kind? She can afford to be. Her father left her millions. My father died without a cent. Victor had to take me in. His penniless niece. He was glad to take her in-very glad. "The Little Heiress." It's all I've heard from the time I was 10 years old. Don't you think you've had enough? I suppose so. I usually don't drink this much. So I'll know what I'm saying- The proper questions, the correct answers. Not tonight. Tonight, I'm going to be careless... And talk too much. You don't know what it is to have to say thank you to somebody you don't like for everything you get-day after day, year after year! I never had anything of my own. Until I thought she was dead. Then Victor gave me everything I ever wanted. And now she's back, and all I've got is... Oliver. But Victor could continue to do things for you. How? Victor has very expensive tastes. Takes every cent he makes to live the way he does- More than every cent. Oh, why did she have to come back? Now I have had too much to drink. I was just beginning to get interested. Interested or curious? Both. I keep wondering. About the girl who was murdered- Victor's secretary. Roslyn? She wasn't murdered. She killed herself. She was murdered. The police have evidence. How do you know? I gave it to them. You... But... You'd better get out, Althea. I can take care of myself. Easy, Althea. All right... I do know something. I talked to Roslyn that night. I heard her scream. Victor, I've made up my mind. I'm going away. What about your wife? My wife? I have no claims on Althea. She belongs to mankind. I think you've made a very wise decision. You've been very patient with Althea... Entirely too patient. Going away, if only for a few days, will teach her a much needed lesson. Just exactly what lesson is Althea to be taught? The lesson of humility, my dear. You see, Oliver is leaving you. Did you have anything to do with this? Sounds like one of your clever little plots. No, it was my own idea. Really? An idea of your own? You see, Oliver has become aware of your- What shall I call it?- Your attachment to Mr. Howard, And, for some odd domestic reason, he's worried about it hurting Matilda. Oh. The knight to the rescue. Are you carrying her on your white charger? No. From now on, I ride alone. Who's going to pry you loose from the bar? I think you'd better excuse me. I detest scenes not of my own making. You know, the more I see of marriage, The more thankful I am to be the last. Of a long line of bachelors. What's gotten into you, Oliver? I'd rather not have a quarrel, if you don't mind. I'm not going to swoon at the idea of losing you, But I am entitled to an explanation. All right, I'll give you one- Carefully selected 4- letter words. You're not fooling anyone. I've been watching you ever since. You knew Matilda was coming home. You're still in love with her, aren't you? Aren't you?! As a matter of fact, I am. Well, it won't do you any good. Why do you think I married you? Because of your charm? I only married you for one reason, and that was to get you away from Matilda. And I'll do the very same thing with Steve. You're going to leave him alone. Do you hear me? You're not going to cause her any more unhappiness, or- I don't like to be threatened. I can threaten, too. It will give me a great deal of pleasure. To break up our dear little Matilda's marriage. I'll kill you first. Really? You plan to shoot me, stab me, or, uh... String me up like poor Roslyn? Oh, I'm fed up with your cheap heroics! Go on, get out of here! Please, please. Althea, Oliver... You have no idea how your voices carry. I can hear you from the other end of the house. Well, then get him out of here. We'll discuss that later. Will you go into the study? Now, please. Oliver, be smart. Pack your bag, enough things for a few days, And go right away from here. All right, Victor. You know best. Ah... Can't we postpone this lecture till some other time? This room gives me the creeps. I like it. The outside world is so far away in here. I can't hear it... it can't hear me. That's why I had the room soundproofed... So I can be completely alone. Completely undisturbed. What is it you wanted to speak to me about? A phone call, my dear. The phone call you put through to this house. The night that Roslyn was murdered. The phone call that Mr. Donovan has succeeded in tracing. The one with which you aroused. Mr. Howard's interest a few minutes ago. I didn't say anything to him. Oh, dear. I've tried so hard to teach you the value of truth. You see, I heard you. Of course, I know that eavesdroppers never hear any good of themselves, But I thought it was rather unfriendly of you. To accuse me of having murdered Roslyn. You can't frighten me. You wouldn't dare do anything to me! I want the truth, Althea. Did you or did you not tell Mr. Howard. That I murdered Roslyn? Yes. I said I thought so. And why didn't you share your suspicion. With the police, or at least tell them of the phone call? I was afraid of what would happen to you. Always thinking of your dear uncle. That's right. Sit down. You and I were enjoying Matilda's money, weren't we? Now that she's come back, What do you suppose is going to happen to you? You'll take care Of me, Victor. You must have money hidden away- money Matilda could never trace. You and Roslyn had one trait in common: You were both much too inquisitive. Oh... So that's why you killed Roslyn. Yes. It's a pity, isn't it? You were always my favorite. You know that, don't you? So charmingly unscrupulous... But so greedy. It's too bad. Oh, no! No, don't! Don't shoot! Don't! Victor? Victor? Oliver. Victor, I wanted to tell you that I'm leaving. If I could call a cab- You'll do nothing of the kind. With a garage full of cars? Here's the key to the coupe. You use my hotel room in town for a couple of days. I'll call the clerk and tell them to expect you. Tomorrow, you and Althea are going to feel very differently about this. I'll get your coat for you. Here you go, Oliver. Thanks, Victor. Thanks for everything. Not at all. Good luck. And don't forget you've been drinking, Oliver. Drive carefully. I will. Matilda, I... I saw your light. I had to talk to you. Please don't keep running away from me. You-you might have phoned. Anyway, I have nothing to say to you. Is that perfectly clear? Perfectly. But you're going to listen to me, just the same. You're in a great deal of danger. You've got to get out of this house. Aren't you being a little bit theatrical? Maybe I am... But your life won't be worth much if Victor finds out what Althea's been telling me. What are you talking about? Oliver didn't break your engagement because he wanted to. It was all arranged by Victor. That's not true. And if Roslyn had been warned as I'm warning you, she'd be alive today. Roslyn? Don't you realize it's because I want to help you? Because I. Don't want anything to happen to you. You've got to trust me, Matilda. Oh, Steve, I want to. I'd like to believe you, but you're asking me to- No, I can't believe Grandy would do anything to hurt me. Althea, on recording: You're not fooling anyone. I've been watching you ever since you knew Matilda was coming home. You're still in love with her, aren't you? Aren't you?! Oliver, on recording: As a matter of fact, I am. Well, it won't do you any good. Why do you think I married you? Because of your charm? I only married you for one reason, And that was to get you away from Matilda. Matilda! Matilda, it's Oliver and Althea. They've been drinking. I've never seen a man in such a blind rage. You're the only one he'll listen to. Why, Howard. I had no idea... Come along, Matilda. Break up our dear little Matilda's marriage. I'll kill you first. Really? Oh, no! No, don't! Don't shoot! Don't! Amah! Oliver. Althea! Oliver's gone. Oh, this is awful! No sign of him. He must have gotten away. Operator... Get me police headquarters, please. Code number 99. Hard-top, light gray coupe. New York, 4h23022. Probably using Sawmill River Highway. Caution-Man is armed. Repeating. Code number... Rifling checks on the bullets. The bullet that killed Althea was fired from this gun. Well, I suppose that makes it official. You can add, Steve. Two plus two equals- Oliver. My addition doesn't come out the same. Can't argue with mathematics. I'm sorry. As far as this department is concerned, The case is closed. Thanks anyway, Donovan. Goodbye. Goodbye. Two cups? Yes, I like to drink with two hands. I'm sorry, Jane. The train was late. That's all right. Lemon, please. Lemon. You're just in time to keep me from drinking something that would do me no harm. Why did you ask me to come here? No special reason. I just thought you might like to get away from that house for a while. It's been awful. The police questioning, the funeral... Wasn't very cheerful. How could it be? I mean, it's so big that even the closets have an echo. Why, there's Steve! Fancy finding you here. Small world, isn't it? Yes. Come on over and sit down. If you don't mind. Hello, Matilda. Hello, Steve. Oh, my goodness, I just remembered. I forgot an appointment. I've got to go downtown and match a goldfish. Goodbye. Is everything all right, Mrs. Howard? My dear, sweet man, will you do me a favor- A very big favor? Yes, ma'am. Get lost. Yes, ma'am. Is there anything Else, sir? No, that will be All, thank you. Thank you, sir. Very conscientious waiter. He wants to give me My money's worth. The last time we were here, I bribed him. To call any woman he saw me with "Mrs. Howard." Then we're not married. No. You see, I had to get into Grandison's house, And the only way I could do it was to pretend we were. I had to find out why Roslyn died. Steve, did you know Roslyn? Yes. We grew up together. It was sort of taken for granted we'd be married someday. I suppose we would've if it hadn't been for the war. I'm sorry. I hadn't seen her for over 3 years. When I came back from overseas, she was dead. Her aunt and uncle never believed, and neither did I, That she'd committed suicide. Her uncle had seen her only the day before she died. He was the man who was supposed to have married us- Judge Maynard. Naturally, he was interested. In finding out what really happened to his niece. I, uh... I'm sorry to have dragged you into this, Matilda. You were a very convincing liar. The words were lies. The emotions were honest. And I want to be sure that nothing happens to you. Nothing can. Oliver's dead. Oliver didn't kill anybody. The same thing happened to him. That happened to Althea and Roslyn. He was murdered by your kind, generous guardian, Victor Grandison. Look, Steve, I don't know why you hate Grandy so much, but I will not listen to you saying such things about him. Listen to me! For the last two days, I've been running down all the scattered clues. Victor's very clever, but I think I know how he managed. For us to hear the argument between Oliver and Althea. He had an alibi the night Roslyn died. He said he was at the broadcast. And couldn't have caught that early train. I listened to a record of that broadcast, and timed it. He left early that night. He had plenty of time to catch that 8:30. Maybe he had, but that doesn't prove he did. I'll never believe it. Oh, Steve, I wish it didn't have to be like this. If you only knew how much I liked you, You wouldn't try to make me believe that Grandy- Don't you see it? I don't want to talk about it! Matilda! Just leave me alone! Don't go back there, Matilda! Anything wrong, Mrs. Howard? So he finally admitted that you weren't married, after all. Very interesting... Not married, never have been. I suppose I should hate him. And do you? Of course you don't. In spite of what he's done and said about me, I think you're in love with him, aren't you? Aren't you? Yes, I guess I am in love with him. And I feel like such a traitor to you. But why should you? This has been a dreadful misunderstanding. It will all be over soon, And you and Steven are going to live happily ever after. Then you don't object? My dear, I can be philosophical about everything... Including love, which seems to me to be a curiously unhappy blend of tears and laughter. But if that's what you want, You have my blessing. Oh, Grandy! If he only knew you as I do. If he only knew you as you really are! Perhaps he does, my dear. Perhaps he does. Well, this isn't... Getting on with my radio script for tonight. I, uh... I don't know what happened to Jane. She should be here. She knows I have to dictate these gruesome things. I could help you, Grandy. I used to. Remember? Oh, of course you did. Yes. Come on over here. Not as efficiently as Jane, but if you'll go slowly- Oh, yes. I'll go slowly. Now, uh, now this is uh... This is one of those sordid tales, of course. No, no, don't... don't put that down. I'm just explaining the story. Mary Phillips has just seen her parents... brutally murdered, and feels that she can no longer live without them. Now, her farewell note must be simple, yet convincing. Now, let me... See. Uh... "Having lost two who Were most dear to me," I find life empty, Bitter... "and too lonely." Got that? "May those who are my friends try to forgive me" for taking this way out... "Of a cruel and uncompromising world." There's Your Steven Howard. He's on his way down to the garage. Now we'll... Wipe all the shadows away. Why, your eyes are shining, but in such a woebegone little face. Now, you... You run along and change it, and fix yourself, because this is going to be a moment you'll always remember. And I shall never forget. I'm going to be left all alone with my memories, darling, of your sweetness and your tender affection for me. Grandy, don't talk like that. Even if I did marry Steve, I wouldn't be leaving you forever. Besides, I don't know how he feels about me. We'll find that out. Just leave it to me. Oh, and, uh, Remember... Look your prettiest. Yeah? I know who it is. I need you. Yes. Will you come along as soon as you can, please? I'll be waiting for you in the garage. Thank you. Press. You made good time. Hello, Kent. I thought This was your night off. It is, sir, but the others had left, and I thought- Oh, nonsense. Of course you can go. Here. Take a couple of tickets for my broadcast tonight. Thank you, sir, but your program frightens me. I don't like it. Do you like your job? I like my job. You're not fooling anyone. I've been watching you ever since you knew Matilda was coming home. You're still in love with her, aren't you? Aren't you?! Althea, on recording: Oh, no! No, don't! Don't shoot! Don't! Get me police headquarters. Donovan, homicide. Donovan, this is Steve Howard. I- Hello? Operator, there seems to be some trouble on this line. Can you clear it? Thank you. Hello? If you'll call me back at Croton 48305. That's right. Hello, Mr. Grandison. Hello, Mr. Howard. Just why are you here? To pick up my belongings. I trust you have everything you came for. Almost. Aren't you forgetting... Matilda? No, I haven't forgotten Matilda. I've been very patient with you, young man... Extremely patient. You enter my house- Matilda's house. You enter this house under false pretenses. You sneak into my study, you go through my personal belongings. You delude us all into believing in this fantastic marriage. Did it ever occur to you that I could have you arrested as an impostor? Yes, it did... but an arrest and trial with the evidence it would bring out? You have a great deal of courage, Mr. Grandison, But not that much. I don't know what's going on in the back of your mind, But whatever it is, I shall be very interested to see what happens to you. I hope you won't be disappointed, Mr. Grandison. I was just leaving. I want to talk to you. Yes, I talked to Victor. Come to the guesthouse right away. I'll be down in just a minute. Use the outside stairway. Hurry, darling. Steve? Steve! Oh, hello, Press. Hello, miss. Grandy! Grandy... Now what? Where have you been? What were you doing Out there? Steve called me from the guesthouse to meet him, But he wasn't there, and his car isn't in the garage. I saw Press. Oh, I should've asked Press about Steve. Perhaps He can tell me- You stay here. Have you taken leave of your senses- Running about out there, chasing this man, screaming with hysteria? But, Grandy, Steve might- Steve? Steve? Is that all you can think about? Is that all you can talk about? If you don't get hold of yourself, your mind will crack. I'm sorry, my dear. I'm afraid I've behaved rather badly. You didn't believe a word I said, did you? It's just that I... Well, today, I seem to have reached the breaking point. My nerves are ragged, what with Jane not showing up. To help me with the broadcast, And Steve's abrupt appearance... Oh, that reminds me. I could have spared us both this disagreeable scene. Steve had some trouble with his car. He took the car down to the village, And he asked me to tell you that he'd be right back. But why didn't you tell me before? Oh, that's easily explained. We've all been a little upset. It would be a miracle if we weren't. But are you going to forgive your crusty old Grandy? What we need is something for our nerves. We'll have a little wine, and we'll talk this thing over calmly and logically. Come along, Matilda. Come on. This will bring the sparkle back to your eyes. Well, don't you want to drink with me? No, thank you, Grandy. You don't want Steven to come back and find you looking like a ghost, do you? To please me. You know I don't like drinking alone. I wonder if that's- I'll take it. Hello? It's 10 minutes. I'm Calling, like you said. Hello, Steve. Well, I'm certainly glad you called. We were worried about you. What? Oh, yes. She's, uh... She's right here. In 20 minutes? Let me talk to him. Yes, I'll tell her, Steve. What? Let me talk to him. Just a minute, Steve. She wants to talk to you. Hello, Steve. Hello? Hello? Oh... He must have hung up. Do you think he'll call back? Why should he? He said he'd be here in 20 minutes, As soon as the car is. I'm going to be late for my rehearsal. Here. Here's to you both. Isn't this wine a little bitter? "Dry" is the word, dear-dry. Let me fill it up for you. That will be enough, thank you. I feel much better. Good. It's my best vintage-'28. Oh, it's wonderful. Oh, I feel so relaxed. That's how I want you to feel. Finish it, my dear. Finish it. I... I'm a little dizzy. You're so far away, Grandy. So far away... Can you hear me, Matilda? Can you hear me? So far away... I've never been closer to you. You mustn't say that, Steve. Grandy's always been kind to me-always. Oh... I'll miss you... Steve... Steve...

Blue body, red wheels. Feeling all right? License-2h470j. That's it - Press' truck. Hmm? I remember I saw it parked in front of the garage. Press.

Once again, the United Motors Company, makers of fine automobiles for nearly half a century, present your genial host, the renowned writer, art collector, and teller of strange tales, Victor Grandison. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Grandison speaking. I have another story to bring you- An amusing and delightfully stirring saga of assorted mayhem. It begins, as all good stories do, on a winter's evening 40 years or more ago. I give you, "The Tragedy of The Missing Head." It is not difficult to imagine the feelings of-of the-uh, the feelings of Henry Roberts, for that is the name of our murderer... Um... Hmm? When he came downstairs that cold Christmas eve and found his dear wife lying before the fireplace, dead... at the base of the Christmas tree, its- At the base of the Christmas tree, its ornaments tinkling, an elfin counterpoint to the caroling outside. Ladies and... gentlemen, you're about to experience something unprecedented in the history of our program... or, for that matter, of radio itself. And you who have followed my adventures. In the half-world of Crime for so many years now... you are listening to my last broadcast. Shall I cut him off? No. He started this. Let him finish it his own way. For a time, the unsuspected wore his mask safely. Not for long, however. Soon, he found it necessary to commit two murders more- A young woman who shared His ominous secret... And her husband... Who begin to see how enmeshed he became in his own incredible folly. Would you like to know who the unsuspected really is? It is I. I am the unsuspected... Your genial host... Victor Grandison. Good night.
