Our prestige ruined before him We are unable to catch a single man even though we have much power This is a matter of despair This is a desperate thing indeed Where is he? I need him, however it may be Who are you? - Wait I will tell you Who are you? - Who teased our people in the shopping complex today? He came to your house I think he is your man Call him... I came to tell him it's wrong Go, go outside - No fight, call him Whom to call? Oh gosh! I don't want you. I want the guy who erred.

Will you take photos with the cell phone? What did you say today? Haven't you talked about the red dress? How dare you tease the girls? Is it Rowdyism if you roam with some rouges? You will lose your life if a man like me confronts If we meet again I will smash you. Be careful I will kill you What happened? Someone has come and smashed us for teasing girls Who is he? - Someone called Bhadra He is the Bhadra whom I wanted I came here only to take, his life He is not seen Damn it! Just missed Why it's not falling even though I am trying hard? I got it dear! Who said that females have decreased in our country? I want to talk to you personally It's difficult to stop now Your marriage will be held in next 10 days It's not about me but you About me! What's that? Do you know Rani(queen)? - Which country's? My friend Rani - What happened to her? Did you tell her that she looks gorgeous? She has lost her heart to you and very adamant to marry you She asked me to help her Me! - You might have said it for fun You have to make him agree anyhow... ...l'll soon become the co-daughter in law of your house... ...and she is making such phone calls I asked my husband and children to imitate you thinking you are a good man Is this the way you do? What about our matter? Have you forgotten everything between us and our childhood days? Once you had hold my waist and once you had kissed me You had me again in another instance Are you talking suddenly about Rani? It seems amazing Brother 20 points for you - No - True You keep playing We will talk about my marriage outside. Come let's go. You! Come on tell me now about marriage and all Seems one man had bought it for his girl friend By knowing how much they love I mean how much you love... ...they have sent it to us Sister in law that is... What is it? - Is it love? I like her - Does 'her' mean 'Anu'? Oh Anu! Wait, it's only in my heart She doesn't know that yet Shall we tell her? - Don't do anything, I know when to express it If you can't stop this matter Oh gosh, I will bow down before you Uncle the red one has fallen - Did the red one fell? I am coming What will he do if the red coin falls? Did the red one fell? - Yes Is Rani your girl friend? - No. They are kidding Haven't you loved anyone? Who will love me? To be frank, girls always desire for a jovial person like you What happened sir? Why this gaiety sir? This ecstasy is good! It is the talk of the town! In merry mood every one is like this! Believe me! This is not a magic to be explored! Stop your pranks! Will it not affect brains? Does intellects like you jump in joy like this? When one has lots of work behind... ...Will anyone relax in leisure? Tell me, mom and sisters! We know your tough tasks We would also extent possible help! Know the direction of your steps! How far have you reached? To which star in the sky your naughty breeze has reached? The chase won't end till it is scared Girls in marriageable age should put a stop to this! Why should we do it? Oh man! all your big desires have gone beyond the sky! why do you fight with me? Come on, stop it! What happened? Enough, It's enough I need a girl who loves me alone How can it be like a priest who works in the temple for everyone? Don't think like that Think once more If I think, my life will get over I know you may feel hurt if I say suddenly The break up hurts me so badly... You are a girl, it may take 10 or 2 years or 3 days to forget me But you have to bear it in this birth Do you suspect me? - It is the trust in you Tomorrow if both of us get married... ...and then if you become mother because of him... ...I can't bear if he sayS it as simply and you say it is common I am not for this triangle love Don't you ever try to meet me Did you understand what I said? In fact I didn't understand what I said and how can you? These girls are just like this I will come inside Are you leaving us? This emotion won't suit you I like to see Anu accept your love Anu is very happy. It's only because of you Confess it soon without thinking I want to hear about your marriage when I come next time You study people's psychology very well Come uncle, sit down I'm wondering why my son in law had kept an outsider inside the house In fact, despite being old I am amused by your obedience and softness What's wrong if a young man like him gets tempted? If anyone asks me in the marriage about the arrangement, the decorator... ...and the caterer I can answer that But if they ask about you... ...I am unable to answer them as my son in law said... ...that he is keeping you (as concubine) with him I am a Gandhi's follower I don't like fighting and violence I am quite frank Men won't leave women in the street They like to keep them in the house It's the woman who will land in the street if they go behind everymen I can't imagine a daughter in law other than my daughter in this house I won't be quiet You know I am a business man I view everything in a business angle Even in your matter Or else I wouldn't have fixed the rate for my son in law's taste That's why this blank cheque Come dear! Aunty where is Rammohan Rao? Come son in law, come I am not your son in law Call me nephew Nephew! Did you warn her considering yourself as her father? If I forget just for 10 minutes that you as my mother's brother... I will strip you and hit You! I will kill you if you open the mouth You may be a Gandhi's follower But, I am not What is this without respect to elders! Impolitely your husband had spoken rudely to a girl old enough to be his daughter I've never told that I'll marry Sathya Not even to Sathya, What Sathya? Speak about my mother and father for being your sister and brother in law Speak about me for being their son But she is my girl The girl who has come trusting me I will chop whoever interferes in her matter I will chop them I don't know if it's proper to talk like this in this situation But I must say what I feel I'll forget all the days being with you and your family If I stay like this I may even forget the future So I have decided to go back to London You shouldn't have talked like that for whatever your uncle had said If our people were there in his place they too have behaved similarly May be I am prompted to think about my life because of him For my sake, the struggle that you had... ...the care that you took... Even my my own people would not have done this If I still stay here you wouldn't be able to respond to people's queries The relationship between both of us is not just a friendship I just can't say thanks to that relationship Your decision is important concerning about me Will you send me? There is a girl over there? A girl with me over there? I didn't see - Didn't you see? There was a girl over there, She was just there I didn't see her - You're here only you should have seen her She was just here You there, why're you aggressive? - Aggressive! You there. Stop it, Just now someone had taken her Taken her! What happened to you? I am staying here with the stranger... ...I didn't ask you anything because of the trust in you We didn't question you for misbehaving with relatives But since I am unable to bear it I am asking you today Who is Anu? Since I came to Bangalore I became obese by eating your dish I didn't achieved anything here except roaming with him He became your friend only after you came to Banglaore... ...and you loved his sister? Yes you often tell the truth Hello brother in law Why are you like this? You are going from this happiness to another happiness I feel I may even lose this short happiness You are going to your place right? I don't like to go to my place I don't like the situation there But Anu is coming back from London after a long time I should go for her sake Let's do one thing, I'll also come to your place with you... ...then you come and stay with your sister in our house... ...and you can study or work it's your wish, what do you say? Thanks man Alright, are you going for his sake or for his sister? Tell me the truth, is it for Anu's sake? I am lying, not for Anu's sake Did you join in Bangalore for his sake? I thought it is for Anu Will you stop playing like a nonstop news on the TV? Haven't you changed yet? Is it nice going first time to meet the lover empty handed? Tell me, tell me monkey Our friendship will be cut if you come with me Eat the biscuit What boss, where are you going? - To my future lover's place Your future lover! It's interesting, tell me in detail Stop it. Is it a Ramayana to tell in detail? It is a 'love epic', aren't they asking about details? - Tell Oh moon! hidden behind the clouds! Here is a beauty that would excel yours, look at it Will not the lotus envy at these eyes? No one can vie with her beauty! Sky has come to the earth It dances with me as tiny drizzles! Happiness has crossed the bounds That has turned as jasmines and sings for you! My soul has asked for your name The spark in my eyes says it is you! Let the heart long for the prime age sans experience If you give your heart I will join you! If you give some more freedom I would become yours! The moment I saw you my glass like heart... ...was shaken and aroused desires! Not paying heed to me it is flowing like... ...a river in my mind! and desires are being drowned! The breeze has shown me the way you have gone! Are you playing hide and seek with me? Come this side once! Don't ask for details come out of dreams Oh handsome boy! You belong to which place? He has come to entice He is lisping with me in the field He has set aroused my cool heart! Is he born for me? This mischievous guy has impressed me! I have noticed the shines of rainbow in your body! Oh myna, you are the destination for glitter! Day break's crimson red is a drop of your blushes! Unknown desires are hidden in this heart! Oh charming girl! Flowers have bloomed by your smiles You have brought light to my life! Permit this youth to join you! You have lost weight by the jail's food your anger might have lessened Brother They want to quit the job Our wives are forcing us to quit the job They don't want us to do this job They want us to work as a labor but don't want to do murders Nobody in our house is agreeing to work against Surendra Our wives are not even letting us near I will work I will work for you only Don't kill me Since the age of 15 I am living with enmity Will you forget the enmity for the sake of wives? How can I forget him who want to turn this house into grave yard? The anger will subside only after killing Surendra Tulasi is released from the jail Your place looks nice He is my brother Have you came to receive? Did you write well in the exam? - Yes I did He is my best friend Bhadra - Greetings sir! - Greetings! Come Basava, how are you? - I am fine Brother in law, you said they can kill many persons... ...but here they seem like a Lord Baba Shut your mouth Seems Dad is recovering from paralysis You're looking recovered. I am looking to finish them who made dad like this What is your next plan? - That is... What is there? It will be marriage I mean I want to get married and want him also to... What've you achieved that you're talking about marriage now? Why do you say now? We were born long ago? He might've drunk Vasa (a drink) in his childhood. - He is torturing us Brother he has turned the jeep in the red soil field Kill them before they enter to the village He should die Don't leave even if he goes underneath! Hey Raja! You Scoundrel! We shouldn't leave these fellows I am unable to do anything I too have become a sick man like you We are living as handicaps hit me, hit me father There is no celestial advantage We should tread path carefully No, not the celestial advantage I am an useless fellow I am useless Yes I am Nobody will live, We're alive to take their lives Yes he is there Brother, DSP on the line Go in Yes it's me You do your formalities No there won't be any trouble from my side But do something. It's a mistake to think my silence as weakness If I lose my patience, you can't imagine the loss that I can cause For how long? We are quiet but they are aggressive They are not like you We have to do something Are you ok? All the boys are in town Permit us, we will kill all of them Wrong You shouldn't talk like this even by mistake You have come for the festival Go to your college after festival Go Nobody will study if something happens to this God We will kill them We will kill them I am hungry, give me food Basava, Anu is coming in the morning I will take care of that Have you understood about our town and our people? Stop loving Anu and forget her I also say it. It's better she lives with me rather than with you I won't forget her She will be safe near Bhadra Trust me You... Tell me - Call me a monkey Tell me, I am eager to hear it I wasn't able to spend time with you since you came How did you write your exam? - Well - He wrote well because he sat beside me You look like my sister Where do you have a sister? I mean, my sister would have been like her, useless You also look like my brother Ask me, whatever you need till you stay here Without shame! Ok, go to bed early You have to bring Anu in the morning If she is sister in law for you then sister for me What's there in? Come let us sleep When will the morning come? Tomorrow morning - Should I come to receive her? Yes the queen of England is coming... ...and should be received as a protocol by you the President of India Shut your mouth and sleep, you donkey! If I come to the station my introduction to her will be more formal So what? - The President will stay in the house You prepare to receive the queen and boast about me on the way When she reaches the house, like a hero I will... ...remove the helmet and shake the hair and I'll do something crazy What to tell? - Should I tell that also? My friend Bhadra, a hero It's minimal whatever I say about him He is very sharp person like a sword Girls are very crazy about him Using these kind of words... ...even though many girls follow him tirelessly... ...you should tell that he doesn't even glance at them Will you stop this topic right now? - I won't I won't - What? - I won't, whatever you do I won't stop Oh gosh! I won't stop - Listen Oh gosh! Damn! Me too I thought he was just flattering about you while on the way... But on seeing you I feel he has told less about you I thought I will be bored here but you are there right? You are so sweet Brother in law I am really fortunate to have you Oh Lord Rama! How lucky is it if a boy gets a boy? Oh gosh! Is this all a dream? But only that will happen Sister in law Sister in law! - After you went to London you became... Sister in law don't say I didn't eat properly and became thin I mean, you've become fat after going to London You too were same as me while in my age Isn't it brother? - What a reply you gave her! She always used to be slim You and your hair style! Like a sage with trimmed hair Is this the way young boys look? Why do you ask about the style? This kind of relationship in this look also! I am Bhadra What a man are you? Did he tell? Did he tell everything about me? Like sword, sharp, super, craze and university rank holder Did he tell that? Sure he would have told People blow their own trumpet but he has praised about me Of course he would have told the truth. It is ok for Anu What would others think? Wouldn't it be like flattering? Useless fellow You and your dirty smile Get lost Last year the Thums up company gave me 'Man of Bangalore' award... ...Did he tell that? Who are you? Come You scoundrel? I tried to give an entry like Amitabh Bachchan... where is it? How dare you make me Johnny Lever? I gave signals from behind like a traffic constable But you were speaking like a news bulletin Will you taunt me by useless reasons instead of boasting about me? I am her brother it's improper to woo through me If you want you can try it yourself I will do, Everyone follow the girl they love ...But this Bhadra will make the girl follow him whom he loves What do you say? It mean the craze! Does it mean to get blows from girls? - You're finished You are doing too much You are finished Come, out side - Leave me - I won't Stop it What is this? How atrocious? Do you have sense? The boy is frightened with panic! Boy! It's not like that - What is not like that? I have been watching since you came you are always behind Raja Be quiet. It's just for fun - Shut your mouth He dragged it because of your innocence Be proper if you want to stay here That won't work here - Wear this - What 'won't work' here? Did you see? So much has happened just for touching me If they come know that you are wooing my sister... Bhadra, you are too lucky Why are you scared? - It doesn't look good if you scared alone It will be uncomfortable because you came directly from London My native place won't be uncomfortable for me You are also like me, too frank I am frank but you are over frank Am I overdoing it? Isn't it my love? What? I thought she is nice for being your sister but she is a tough person Savithri has come Who is Savithri? Who is Savithri? - Savithri is our Basava's sister What are you doing? Tell me who is Savithri? - Don't tell him Shut your mouth, you tell me - Don't tell him That is a never ending love story Sister, I've brought butter for Anu and Raja Won't you come if they are not here? I will come back after seeing Anu That story is still there, as it is It has come upto here Oh gosh! shying? Are you fine? Seems you have become thin? - Has he become thin? You have been caught Will you stay for 4 days? No, he will stay for 4 years. Why? Take your hand What is the use? What does it mean? Leave me - Leave me Leave me, listen to me - Come - Please man, come Both of them like each other It started when they were in inter grade they don't have the courage to tell you By the time you know, he will do her marriage and you will do his marriage Then they will suffer and then you would regret for not doing their marriage Is it necessary? I mean is it necessary? I like Savithri very much - Me too You! Brother be quiet How dare she... Both of you by uniting made my Basava as my relative Brother thanks - Brother! Not like that man, oh what a love How are you man? - I am fine Ok what is Raja doing? He has settled with my help But there is no cooperation in my matter Can't you propose directly without his cooperation? I can, but they will kill me if any misunderstanding occurs Why, Is she tough or soft? - She looks tough but soft How can a soft one make a match for you? Tough girls suit only for flirting but to fall in love and marry... ...a soft one like 'Keerthi Reddy' in 'Tholi Prema' is enough I will live by watching her... Have you confessed your love? Why are you not talking? Does she at least match me? Did you give that sari? What, is she near you? - Don't play with my life, keep the phone Is it your girl friend? - A girl like friend, she is also Raja's friend Ok leave my matter Why did you come here? I am unable to forget what you did for Raja and Savithri It's something You have to do a small help for me too You mean, are you also in love... Not that - Oh gosh! - You should take me out without anyone's knowledge To the temple, it's my vow to visit the temple after returning from London Everyone else refused when I asked them What will you give me if I take out? I'll give Rs.100 You move You Wastrel! Don't these green crops look nice? Being reserved won't really suit you You can talk something - Do you have any boy friends in London? Don't you guys have any other topic with the girls? What is the policy of Tony Blair regarding Bin Laden's matter? No, only these kind of topics suit us Then what? Tell me Do you have anyone? At least intimacy with anyone I may look like a rogue with my face and age ...I will come out without any harm if I walk on the fire Then who is your lucky girl? - You I meant you haven't said anything about yourself I don't consider this love and all as a issue I don't have the desire to have a pure husband like you. Life is very flat Even if he is a playboy before marriage... ...he should feel me as his own world after the marriage Pure! Me! I flirted with many girls in Bangalore... If I alight from the city bus... Oh gosh What man, it has been reversed? Didn't you tell me to be frank? That's why I committed myself Thank God! I was able to fulfill my vow with your help Is it a help at all? Then what next? To have meals with drumstick sambar I mean what next in your life A job in London, to get to a good position... ...then a good husband ...And settle down happily with him forever This is atrocious Being born, brought up, studied and grown with people, getting a good heart here... ...and giving that heart forgetting the Mother land to someone at abroad... ...is an atrocious act Going there to earn more money Getting the green card and claiming that children are comfortable Saying the they doesn't know Telugu properly and sending money... ...gadgets to shower affection I condemn this attitude What about sincere Telugu boys like me if everyone aspires for foreign alliance? First preference should be given to us then to others Even if I go there, I will marry a good Telugu boy like you who had settled here Like me? A little girl is clad in red sari and green blouse! Oh dear! can't bear it and my eyes wink! Hug me in the garden of dhal! Put your arms around at cane sugar grove Shall I examine, explore and make lovable bruises? All your hidden shyness have vanished The young girl's age has caught fire! And seeks the help of this handsome guy! Red sari and green blouse When I look at your seductive eyes, oh Narayana! I have an inexplicable pain in heart! Shall I break the promise Shall I give what all I have? Will you help me to win 'Chemma chakka ' (a game)? Will you defeat me in the 'Sai Aatta' (a game)? Looking at your lust I was lured and it has flummoxed my youth The craving in me has become intense I can't bear the burden of my charm! I will permit you to do that wrong! Shall I turn as a swing and sway you? Shall I multiply my age with yours? Shall I play the game at appropriate time? Shall I consume whatever I get? Will you rule me as my king? Will you take me to the peak of pleasure? As the lamp is put out with smoke if we come together... ...it would be a wonderful world with inexplicable stupor... Disperse them Disperse the goats on the road Disperse If anyone dares to come close I will slit her If anyone dare to come forward I will slit her. Come Is this a counter act? You've safely handed over her to him At last you have kept her safe in my hand He is insane... If think for a second his wrong step can be understood What is the use if Anu is an hostage in his hand? He has to escape by using her as a shield... ...or else he has to hurt her if we do anything Either will not happen. He will be finished here if Anu is not in his hand We won't let him escape with Anu either What is the matter now? Stop. I will kill Why do you tell the same thing? - Stop Didn't I say that she is safe? Tell him brother, he is not listening This trouble wouldn't have happened had he died All my ideals in these days spoiled because of your wielding the knife Whom did you ask while going? You might have gone near some Gods not the temple He will go back after staying for four days He can't understand the enmity and it's depth here But you are... Surendra's sister They are following our every movement Aren't you all educated? You should have the sense how to stay understanding the situation here Those who created the scare to go even to the temple in their hometown... ...should only have the sense Yes a man should have the sense to kill another man! If they are treading the wrong path, what were you doing? Stop, Are you talking after knowing the problems here? You have created and grown the problems... ...both of you are causing it mutually For how long will you do this? You can solve this by holding talks instead of both dying in the hell To compromise for love, ragging, tussles in the canteen before the sunrise... ...this is not your college problem The enmity, enmity of generations which has stemmed in each nerves Why does this situation exist if it can be solved through the talks? What do you think of me? Surendra M. Tech. from BITS Pilani After loving and marrying... ...we came here to live with lot of hopes and ideals But this town, already burning with rage... ...Welcomed me with my father's dead body I saw people surge with rage I saw parent's agony I saw the aggressing youth I decided to end this problem to solve it I came to change everything but I changed myself instead I took the sickle after seeing my father's dead body When I go out every time... ...she expects desperately whether I will come alive or as a corpse... ...she trembles every second In this situation, to avoid from taking the again after I die... ...we have decided not to beget kids We didn't know for how long this will exist It should stop at this generation We send young men like you to study in far away place From now on they should live without hatred and be innocent like children They should live in peace I don't know whether this tussle is right or wrong... ...but when people salute on seeing me... ...my instinct tells me I am still a human There is no place to live with this enmity You may have the self power but he has the manpower You won't withstand that manpower If you also become like him, put 2 more chairs beside like this... ...and I'll have that strength in me But this heart doesn't have the strength to... ...bear to see dead bodies of you both I will prostrate before you for the sin of growing you... Go away somewhere until the situation calms down Do you want to escape? - No I am telling to live? Didn't I tell you I will come? It seems this is the first marriage in this earth by your haste Keep the phone What man? You are talking about the marriage, is it yours? No sister it is my would be brother in law's I am giving my sister Then when is your fiancée's marriage? Is it love or arranged? I meant, first we will love then our family will arrange the marriage Have you seen the girl? - I am seeing her I am searching for her - Tell me how should she be? I will see if anyone is there in our family matching you She should be like a dimple in moon's face when she smiles Hair should be long enough like the flying smoke of incense sticks The ears which hear me should be like a conch The eyes which see me should shine like the stars Should hands be like a drumstick and legs be like a snake gourd? Ravulamma! - Ok I will keep quiet Then what about dowry? He should give the dowry if he wants a girl with those qualities I am ready already - Do you really want a girl? Girl! Will he marry a boy instead of girl? If a strange character like him demands such a girl... ...then our Anu deserves a more qualified groom That's all brother, he has vanished Are you there? I am searching for you everywhere Come, sit down - Sit down I want to tell something to you? - What? Regarding Anu's marriage - Anu's marriage means? Some marriages which are connected with Anu's marriage Take Basava brother for instance, Why hasn't he got married till now? ...just to get the Savithri marry first Now Raja is ready to marry Savithri But why has he married? It's because of Anu's marriage That means all these have a life only after Anu's marriage If you arrange her marriage with a smart boy... ...you can see them live a cheerful life What do you say? - It's good, tell me again You be quiet. We will talk about my marriage later Let him say - He will shy like this You keep thinking about Anu's marriage It won't happen - I am already trying for Anu's marriage What brother? I want to talk to you regarding Bhadra What happened? We want Anu to get married to Bhadra All of us like him. We think he'll make a good match for Anu But for Anu... - Not yet told I mean she won't reject it but... ...we didn't tell her. It's not good without knowing what is in his mind He may feel shy if we ask... You are his friend right? Ask him and tell today itself Come, let's go to the temple - Brother! In fact he came here for Anu He likes her very much He has bought this sari to gift to Anu if everything goes as per his wish It's believed that Lord Sri Rama has appeared here Nowhere else the Dussera festival is celebrated so grandly like here It's a stick game This is not a game for city boys like you It's all about wielding the sticks - This is not like a boy wooing a girl If something happens... You proceed Leave the place - Brother in law What man? - Brother has decided to get Anu married to you What about Anu's wish? They will ask her now, she will agree if brother and sister in law agree I am happy after so many years Give that phone Renu, Bhadra has become my brother in law Is it? Have your people accepted him? They have become his fans for monkey-like behaviour In fact they only asked whether he will marry When have they fixed the marriage? - Wait for the marriage invitation card Come let's go to Anu I will ask Anu If you ask she will say, as you wish If I ask she will tell the truth Come here Hack them Brother where are you? You scoundrel! Are you ok? - Go, first take care of them Oh gosh! Brother! Brother! Brother, sister in law! Sister in law Brother! - Brother! Bhadra take them away and save them Listen to me Go, they will kill them also Go away Come - Be careful Bhadra take them away Brother! You are alright You are alright Brother! Oh gosh! Brother! What? - Brother! They will kill my sister Save her Go away from here If you can't go between you and me... No, Brother! Come! - Brother! Brother! Not all are finished one of them has escaped That last glance is still in front of my eyes when he cried to save Anu Had I told this earlier... ...fearing about me you wouldn't have let Anu to stay with me Have you thought this family which prays for your happiness won't share the difficulty? You had let loose the one who was caught Brother Surendra's sister is also with him Veeranna, not only the one who had killed... ...your brother, I need her life also Father, I won't come alive without taking their life I am very happy I thought you have become an orphan after losing everyone You joined this house with God's grace and brother's good deeds After seeing the affection of this family on you... ...I like to see you permanently stay here with them Had your brother been alive he would have given you to this kind of house You are going to London tomorrow I've made all the arrangements Why should she go to London now? - She should go She has a life for herself I don't want to end that here In this situation her presence here is not safe Your problem will not be over if she goes You don't know the Veeranna's matter - He doesn't know about my matter I am not lucky enough to have my desires fulfilled Even though I expect love from him... ...the care he has taken for me is enough All my dear ones are going away from me Why should all this happen to me? You stood for her when there is no one for her Why do you send her alone when all of us are with you? She will live happily If you send her what about you? - I'll be happy Not like that It is happy to fall in love and it is fortunate if it gets fulfilled I will live happily without that fortune... Hereafter, don't talk about this. Anu is going. Oh mind! will you not pay heed to me? Your love is an illusion Has it not seen the reality? Not able to move your heart my silence remained dumb Not able to follow you my life has turned a statue Oh mind! forget the past and live! Will the sky come down for the tidal waves? No use being remorse for the distant moon! The time we were together was due to... ...the good deeds of the past birth Futile love is due to lack of good deeds Oh mind! don't forget the remaining memories! Does a ship carrying passengers in her lap... ...ask them not to leave her? Will this journey stop at mid sea? Did my memories that wake up refuse to come to light? Oh mind! This is the way dreams melt down! There is nobody here Brother - Everything is safe here. Come to airport... ...l'll also come - Ok Where are you now? - I am nearby only What? - Take care Time is running out Time is running out, come Come let's go Aren't you our Raja's sister? Where is your monkey husband? Whatever it may be our Bhadra is a true lover... He fell in love after seeing you in the CD He hasn't called me till now about the fixing of your marriage What, what happened? Where is Bhadra? You are an illiterate. You're so obstinate. Being educated, how obstinate I would be? You have grown enmity against me for killing your brother But you have killed my friend and his family in front of my eyes... ...What should I do for that? Had I wished I could have killed you along with your brother there itself Is killing a big thing? Haven't you come with a grudge? Come That grudge should also get scared Either my head will fall... ...or all of your heads, if I win You've killed a good man who wanted to end the fight in this generation Come on You have sent me without knowing whether I love you or not After loving me so much How did you manage to send me? All these should end with us It's our brother's desire You should live happily That's the wish of this brother
