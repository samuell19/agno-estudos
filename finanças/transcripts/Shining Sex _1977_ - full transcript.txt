There's a couple who wanna see you. What are they like? Meh. - And now the Obanos Hotel is very proud to present the charming and delightful Cynthia, direct from Las Vegas. Here is Cynthia in her own creation, "Shining Sex." Waiter. Yes, sir. - Don't forget to ask Miss Cynthia to join us after. Of course, sir. I'll see to it at once. Good evening. Would you care to sit down? Thank you. What would you like to drink? Scotch. Well, I hope you all enjoyed my show. You know, I have other numbers that might be considered more spicy, but since we're in a nice nightclub, they don't always let me do what I like. Ah, thank you. Oh, yes, it's a pity you didn't see me in Hamburg. I did a marvelous number with a racehorse. That's super-porno, you understand? Oh, and after that I did a show with two other women. Tiring, but it resulted in my first contract in the Middle East. What wonderful people. And oh, the presents, you wouldn't believe. I sure was number one out there. - Miss Cynthia, would you like to come with us? Oh, of course I would. I mean, that's what I'm here for. Gee, I'm sorry about my place. It's just a bit small for a threesome. But perhaps yours. All right, our place. Terrific. I've got nothing against that. I have confidence in your taste. I'll put the car away. Hmm. Pretty place you've got here. I like it. It's cozy. Ah. Mmmm. Ah. Oh. What are you playing with those flowers for? Why don't you come over here? Come on, I don't bite. That's it. Come on, I'll show you a good time. Ah. We can have fun together. Come here and sit down next to me. Mmmm. Oh yeah. Oh, that's so good. Closer. Kiss me. You savage. Come here. Oh, you do like a little nip, don't you? Now watch. How shy you are. Mmm, you're so cute. Boris. Boris! Good evening, Professor Seward. Where were you, Boris? I was asleep. So you can't have heard them. There is someone or something close to us, Boris. Something frightening. It could be supernatural. Something frightening. A little while back I had the impression that all the objects in the clinic had an existence of their own. Boris, help me. I must go to the library. Lift me to the wheelchair. Oh, good morning. Good morning. Please, please, come to me, please. Marco. No, please. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Come in. Will you bless me, Madame Pécame? Who told you to come? The shades of the night told me, madame. What led you to me? A voice. The voice of silence. What is it that you're seeking of my knowledge? Life and death. Follow me. Come then. But you are extremely ill. You have an illness that's strange, unknown. The product of something frightening. I must shake the ashes. They will reveal all. You're in contact with them. With my enemies. They're jealous of my knowledge. I know them. They're everywhere. I have the feeling that I've always known you. You have known me forever. Because it's the light in my eyes that you know. But they don't belong to me. Did Alpha send you? She wants your death. I know. I've been awaiting this for some time. They want to destroy my wisdom, but it's impossible. I've already transferred it to another. But I won't tell you his name. And I don't wanna know. A superior force obliges me to love you and then to kill you, and I only obey. I neither love nor hate you. Boris! - Professor, Professor, what's the matter? Professor Seward, tell me, tell me. What is it? Professor, you must tell me. What is the matter with you? Aren't you feeling well? Professor, talk to me. She's there, Boris. I can see her, at the entrance to the castle. She needs us. You must go and find her. She's all alone. Lost. You must go and find her, Boris. And bring her here. Hurry, hurry. Yeah. She's regained consciousness. Where am I? Help me up, Boris. Help me up. Hurry. Boris, you must analyze this substance immediately. Certainly, Professor Seward. This is very serious. What is your name? Please reply to me. What is your name? Tell me. My head hurts. Who are you? I'm in pain. Help me. Answer my question. My head. My head hurts, please. Answer me. Tell me. Do you know a woman called Alpha? No. Try and remember. No, Alpha, no. No, no, no! - Does the name Alpha have any meaning for you at all? Alpha, Alpha. It's her name. The woman who has drained me of my willpower. Boris! Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia, Cynthia, Cynthia, Cynthia. Cynthia, Cynthia, Cynthia. Boris, quick. She's gone, Boris. They're luring her away. But who are they, Professor? Do you know who they are? Yes, I know, or I think I do. It's someone who's directed by Alpha. Alpha? Who's Alpha? - A being who belongs to another dimension. It has come amongst us to seek information about our habits. But we ourselves can't approach this being. She's in a trance, directed by a power greater than her own. To try and stop her would certainly mean her death. Will we see her again? - Assuredly, but it will probably be too late. She's already contaminated by this odd substance. It has undoubtedly destroyed the fiber of her tissue. No, stop it, leave me alone. No, don't touch it, let me go. No! You must control her. Don't be frightened of me. I promise I'm not going to do you any harm. What are you? I'm a human being. A normal human being, just like you. You're a being, a human being, if what you say is true. - I know it's very difficult for you to understand. It was a long time ago. The boat that I was traveling on was unexpectedly enveloped in a sudden heavy fog. We all then lost consciousness. And when we finally woke up, we were in a strange unknown place. We had entered another dimension, that was very strange. It appeared to us like another corner of the earth. And Alpha? She is of the other dimension. I am her servant, or better, her slave. But... what do you want of me? Why did you pick on me? Why won't you let me go away? I don't understand anything anymore. Because you've been designated to accomplish an important mission. What mission? And why me? - Alpha had orders to eliminate those beings who've become dangerous to us. Who've come to know too much about us. One of them being an initiate named Pécame, who you've already killed. The other's a biologist, Kallman, who you've got to kill. I don't wanna hurt anybody. I don't wanna. I've never caused harm to anyone. No, leave me alone. No. I can do nothing. The mission must be accomplished. You're Alpha's instrument, and she's chosen you to trap and kill the condemned. Your body's impregnated with a substance that is fatal on contact. But you're a man. You know I'm innocent. We could escape together. But you... you wouldn't like to make love to me? I was immunized a long time ago. I can make love to you, despite the fact that your vagina is deeply contaminated with this deadly matter. But you're not frightened of me? I love you. You're very beautiful. Well, we're all alone here. No one can see us. Well? I'm sure you'll never regret making love to me. I promise. Come. No. Where are you going? Come back. Oh, no. Please don't leave me like this. Please come back. No. Please, no. Come back, please. Come back. Please, please, I beg you. Come. Oh, please come back. Please. The moon tonight is full. She is traveling through the portals of space. She has arrived at an unknown shore. Far away. Perhaps... Perhaps it's Africa. She's climbing the gang plank of an old boat. A victim is on his way here too. I know him. He's Kallman, the famous biologist. The man who is researching into the phenomena of other dimensions. They haven't met yet, the victim and his executioner. They're going together on the tide of this river, the lost river, towards death. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Kallman. Who are you? Good evening. What are you doing here? Get out of here at once. Are you frightened of me, Mr. Kallman? I'm frightened of nobody. But it must've been you who were calling me a while back. Mmm, yes. I wanted to give you a surprise with my presence. Who are you? Where do you come from? Does it matter? I suppose not. - Maybe then from the world of your research. Are you afraid of making love to an unknown? Hmmm? No, I love the unknown. I'm always searching for it. Your body is very alluring. It seems metallic, but it's tender, and your skin is soft. Professor... Professor Seward. You must... Humanity must know there are beings... She's dead. Paralyzed. Let's hope someone will believe us.
