[birds chirping] -[glass breaks] -[heavy music] Dad! Dad! [orchestral music] [paper slicing] [woman singing] [singing continues] [scissors slicing] [singing fades] [foreign word] Thank you Thank you, for the cheque. Put that other motherfucker. Purse middle zipped compartment. Right, see just one of the many reasons why I love you. Do you know how much to use? Yes. [Vicky - foreign language] Love you, my adorable little anal compulsive. [engine whirring] [door slams] What hoops did your minions arrange for me to jump through this time huh? Don't be a dick. -There's a new program. -One I haven't tried yet? -Lucky me. -I'm not the one with a DUI. I'm not the one being threatened with jail. You act like I come up with reasons to torture you, -for fun. -I don't dad, chill. I hear the words, I'm having a hard time buying them. Okay, I'm sorry. You don't have a hard time buying everything else. My years at therapy and rehab, my BS diploma, my freedom. -[laughs] -Give me that. [glass slams] There's a mentoring program at the University, with a high success rate for people like you. [smirks] People like me. It's an addiction recovery program. It's a new approach. Initiated by the program director, who by the way is going to be your supervising professor. -No shrinking. -Shrinking, yes, it's in conjunction. You'll see a physiatrist outside the University system. The program focuses on the student's transition back into academia. So you can graduate and eventually find a place in the real world. -But, I'm not a student. -You are! It's an excellent opportunity. You've anted to be a writer since, forever, right? A lot of shit since forever. You will do this. Or else? Don't be ridiculous, the court will put you in jail. These should help you sleep, they're herbal, supposed to be non-habit forming. Shawn. You need to make this work. [soft piano music] Okay. [music] [machine whirring loudly] [file falls] [machine turns off] Mr. Wittig, you're seven minutes late. Wow, that's really an improvement for me. Not from my perspective. Oh shit you're the JT Dalton. I prefer Professor Dalton. Okay, Professor Dalton. Rule number one. Don't waste my time Mr. Wittig. Wait in my office I will be with you in seven minutes. Aye aye, Prof. Dalton. Huh. [fingers click] Don't touch my things. Wait for it, wait for it! Now, it's seven minutes. Is that your idea of being clever? Well, I was going for cute, but alright, I'll take clever. Rule number three, be on time, I get that. I've no doubt you can read Mr. Wittia. My job is to make sure you reach your goals. That will be easy, I don't have any. I can see you. [clicks fingers] [piano music] [bubbling] I looked it up honey, D2O is traceable. I'll check our isotope, otherwise, there is cause. -Swing the bat. -Don't. You worry too much. Would you just let me in already Huh? [foreign language] Do I look like I need your fucking protection? Nothing I haven't done before baby. -Do it! -[foreign language] We were fucking babies then, and that was Taiwan. -Women don't swing, bend down. -[foreign language] What happened to not leaving each other behind? Vicky, I'm invoking my right. No, don't. [piano music] [running footsteps] I made it with a minute to spare. Happy? Impressive, Mr. Wittig, including the rules you broke yesterday. It's a real talent to break four before you even begin work What? Wait, you think I broke four? Do you even remember what it is? Oh, rule number four? Um, yes no altered states. Ethanol surely doesn't slow down your synaptic transmissions Ethanol? Two buck chuck. I'm not drunk. There goes rule number five. Are you trying for a record Mr. Wittig? Rule number five. Oh, I'm not lying. I can smell it from here. Note to self, get more tic-tacs. Ok, it was one little drink, more like a sip. Really it won't happen again. You read the contract and signed right? Yes, just consider me warned. Oh, you think that's all you're getting? -Fuck. -First offence hey. Better take a break, you look like you're getting high from the fumes [suspenseful music] [door slams] -I'd say you work fast, -Hold the applause please. Don't think I can't smell past the tic-tacs. Nice try. So I did what you asked, I washed every piece of your fine ass china. Pun intended. It stunk like hell, I mean it helped to... take off the edge a little. Ease the pain, you know. I could help you with that... ease the pain. Round off the sharp little edges. Are you sure you're ready to play with the grown ups, Mr. Wittig? Yes, I've been playing with adult before I became one. Bring it. You must be stoned out of your mind. Oh wait that's not all Prof Perfect. You didn't smell the ethanol this time did you? Smells like fat and malt, so green label whiskey? Not that you deserve it. But I was trying to save you some humiliation. Hey, come back here. Hey, you can't get away talking to me like that lady. [fast paced music] You will do this, you need to make this work. W hat hoops did the minions arrange for me to jump through this time, huh? You need to make this work. You must be stoned out of your mind. Wait that's not all Prof. Perfect. You need to make this work. [shouts] [breathing heavily] [panting] The court will put you in jail. I can't even remember her face, dad. You've been twisted up in this, for so long, you've been punishing yourself. None stop. With all the junk in your body, You going to give this rehab a real shot. And you are going to start forgiving yourself. It's time. You did not kill that girl. It was an accident. [pensive music] [piano music] [suspenseful music] Prof. Dalton, Hi, peace offering. Please give me a second chance? No bribes. Except for the apple. No threats, no bark from my father I'll be this programs poster boy what ever you ask I'll do I swear. I'll even pitch up for therapy on time. I mess up once I'll leave you alone without an order. I need your help. Not so fast. [uneasy breathing] You're on academic probation, so all your class work, and work study from my lab will be closely supervised. I want to know where you are at all times. I'll be your fucking slave. Let's minimize the exploiters. I'll be your... fracking slave? [laughs] [vomits] That's some potent stinking sh... stuff. Well western reagent contains Sulphur, which explains the smell. Yes, nothing explains that smell. [clicking fingers] Feeling better Mr. Wittig? Much. An apple? Really? [loud crash] -Your majesty's office door too? -Are you cray? If it's open, let her close and lock up when she leaves, if it's closed touch that doorknob at your own risk it's your life. She doing something naughty behind those closed doors? -Very interesting. -Don't be too interested, She'll shit can you if touch that door when it's closed, This is addition for the rules for the lab. You memorized the rules right? Yes, one to seven. The seventh is that !! Wrong one! Alright, chill man, it's not like it's going to kill me. Da, Hello! D2O not H2O. Deuterium is the isotope of Hydrogen you drink enough of it you die. -Hey. -Hey. You're Carl Wittig's son aren't you? Ah, yes. I'm not sure it's dismay. [giggling] This is my girlfriend Tammy. [nervous giggle] Okay... I'll catch you too lovebirds later. And I'll run those thin little plate thingy's after my class. Thin layer chromatography, TLC, like Tender loving care, but not. Right. Remember why you're doing the TLC? So, I can find out what are the products from your reactions. The samples in the fridge. And viles in the beakers marked for Prof. Dalton. No. I'm kidding, I look for the label for Shawn. Huh, you're a riot, do you know what solvent to use? -Hexane. -Do you know where it's stored? I'll find it. Maybe you should wait for me to do it first. You can use some help with the technique. I got it all right here, in the idiot guide you gave me. Look, it's color coded and everything. [bicycle wheel spinning] -Hey. -Hey dad. Okay, here we go. Samantha Chen survive by her parents and her sister, who is not available for comment. Ellen Chen, according the Chen's neighbors, was institutionalized after the over dose death of her sister. So, your program got you doing that, opening old wounds? That seems counterproductive. I'm just curious. Did you ever meet Ellen? No. No, the Chen family wanted, immunity they wanted us to leave them alone, and to leave Ellen alone, I think we should do that. Anyway, she... she never really got her shit together from what I heard. and that she's still in the mental hospital. You know, she looks a little like that professor of yours. Put her in something sexy, and she could be a hottie. Oh dude, grow up, and while you at it get me a beer. Grow up. You're riding you don't want it. We'll see. [window slides closed] [water running] [water dripping] [dripping] [gentle music] [music builds] [draw opens] [suspenseful music] [camera wind clicks] [music continues] [music fades] [camera snaps] Hey Shawn. [camera snaps] Amy. How was your weekend? It was great... -Yes? What'd you do? -Hmm. Did you have fun? I like fun too. Okay, um I got to... get to class so, if you'll excuse me. Whatever. You don't know what you're missing out on. [multiple camera snaps] [Asian music] [piano playing] Well thanks for coming. Did I have a choice? Do you have kids professor? You're a parent, you love your son, I get it. Do you? Yes, more than you know. And in light of that, I expect to be kept up to date on his progress. It seems like such a small thing to ask after such a large donation, wouldn't you agree? No, it's only natural, but Mr. Wittia Carl, please. Carl, your son has the right to privacy too. He's not a kid anymore I'm not sure he ever had a chance to be a kid his mother died when he was four. She had cancer, not after that, he needed something, and it was something that I... well I obviously failed to provide. I used to blame my parents for a lot of my misbehaviors, but, then I realized, that they loved me just the way they knew how. I find it difficult to imagine you, misbehaving. Mr. uh... Carl, Your son is almost 30. At some point he has to take responsibility for himself. I signed him up to your program, because your numbers were so good. Having met him. Do you or do you not think you can help him? Trust and I will give him the future he deserves. [eerie scraping] [eerie music builds] [door creeks] Did you zero the balance Mr. Wittig? I didn't know anybody was here. Yes, it's zero. Use the spatula to load the platinum chorum. It's better to under estimate... Oh, frack. I went over it. I'll take it out with this, right? Uh huh. And make sure your fingers don't touch the paper, the small quantity, your sweat or body oil might significantly increase the air margins. [sighs] My hands are too big for this. Oh yes, they're big. Hold it like this, and scoop. Then use your index finger of your other hand tap the dust off lightly. Harder than it looks. It's because you're tired, go home and get some rest Yes, you haven't noticed I'm kind of having a problem with sleep right now. Have you identified the source of the problem? What do you mean? Well, our program used the scientific method as the steps to reach sobriety You like lists, don't you. All the more to focus by. This is what scientists use to reach your goal from beginning to end. Instead of 12 steps you have seven. I've always felt it's the most efficient way for anyone to get anything done. I'm going to need you to hold my hand through this. It's what I'm here for, Step one... Question. What's my question? [suspenseful music] [glugs] [machine whirring] [machine slows] [machine beeps] [foreign language] [language continues] Hey, where you going? -Please. -Please. [child laughing] [singing in foreign language] [baby toy talking] 'mommy, would you like me to sleep? [baby crying]Oh faker... [foreign language] you can't catch me... [baby toy distorting] [foreign language] Show me what you did. Hmm, problem one, those dots are too close, um, Even them out across the line like your dividing your one line into four equal segments. Ed said to draw the spots away from the edges. That's correct, but you have more than enough room to spare. [glass clinks] Works on the principles of capillary reaction it's a attraction between a liquid and a Um, solid surface when they come into contact with each other. I get that. Opposites attract. Three times? [glass clinks] Problem two, it's a heavy load Translation? -Three fast jabs. -Three fast jabs. When you touch and hold, see how it spreads and makes one big mess? I think I'm learning my lesson now. That will give you much, sharper, more focused smaller spots not blurred or spread way out. Thank you, Prof. Dalton. Don't thank me yet. [gas flowing] [gas stops] [slicing] [gentle music] [lid closes] [music continues] [lid turns] [cups clinker] [music quickens] [music fades] [up beat music] [music stops abruptly] [piano plays] Need some help? I'm good. Making sure we're all stock up? Yes. [door closes] [pensive music] [file crashes] [tape rustles] [eerie music] [music fades] [door opens] This gives you leverage, and steadies the transfer, to avoid spillage. Noted. The capillary action I talked about before, it's how we don't spill a drop. The attraction causes a... sucking up action under the realm. Are you paying attention? Absolutely. [moan] [drumming music] [music continues] [music ends abruptly] [piano plays] [running footsteps] Are you serious about this? Can you find me an alternative? Yes, honey move on. I've tried. You know I have. [foreign language] [eerie music] [water bubbling] What are you searching for? Thought you had bottled water? It's not in there. -Sit. -Okay. I'll get it for you. I thought I saw bottles. Those weren't H2O, they were D2O. Still haven't learnt the difference yet, huh? [suspenseful music] [glasses clink] Your choice. You're messing with me, right? What do you think? [breathing increases] Wait, wait! Jesus you scared me. [giggles] Wash your hands, we're almost ready for dinner. Go! [music fades] [gentle music] [suitcases knocking] [child giggles] [child laughing] [child crying] [gentle music continues] [child giggling] [child laughing cutely] [music builds] [music slows] [eerie music] [Asian music] My parents used to bring me here when I was little. It's beautiful, isn't it? [wind whooshing] My poor parents, I was the worst nightmare. The irony was that my bad influences weren't from China town. Exclusive private school, I was so wild. Crazy. You, wild? Well, I would've loved to have seen that. Sometimes I swear which is just leaves to our hormones'. Melatonin causes drowsiness. Endorphins produce feelings of well being, so Serotonin, regulates our moods, activates our sleep. You mean, being controlled by them? Well yes, progesterone has a common effect. and testosterone and estragon. Uh uh! [foreign language] Oh! How are you, Mrs. Yang? How many years it has been. I sing, I worry about you. If your parents can see you... Very handsome. Thanks. Yes, um... I have restaurant, I make the best Kung Pao chicken. -Come. -Okay, of course. Very nice. I'm there. Mrs. Yang. [loud bang] [flames roaring] [harp playing] [ribbon whooshing] [music quickens] [whooshing continues] [music slows] [handle knocks] [music quickens] [moans] [choking] [gasping breath] [intense music] [loud moans] [music slows] [intense breathing] Wait, stop. It's okay. [hush] I wish I could take it back. But, it doesn't matter. I might as well have taken a gun and shot her. Ouch. Sorry. [thunder] After they questioned me, her dad came in. He was older, distinguished. I thought he would hit me, something. He just... He just looked right trough me. As if, I didn't exist. My dad took care of it all as he always does. The terrible thing is, I don't remember her face. [sobbing] [wailing] [eerie music] [seagulls singing] [waves rolling] [suspenseful music] [waves continue] [music calms to gentle] [music continues] [all sounds fade] I was so miserable. Before we met. I didn't care. But... you make me feel so good. When we're together it's like... it's like it's all fixed. Walk away Shawn. Forget all this, forget me. Just run as far away as you can from here. What, I'm not running, none of these things that you care about matter to me. I'm not who you think I am. I'm beyond repair. It's just, Not my karma at this time. I love you. You shouldn't. You... tell me you don't love me? You can't. Can you? It's okay. You don't have to say it, for me to feel it. [sighs] It's you Shawn. It's always been you. In ways that you'll never understand. [heart beating] [beating continues] [erratic breathing] [engine whirring] [knocking] So, is this where my money's going. -Where is she. -Dad don't. I did not put you in this woman's school so she could seduce you. -Now, where is she? -Just listen to me! -It's not like that? -Not like that! Holy shit. J.T. fucking Dalton, Well, aren't you the shape shifting succulent. Stop it now, or I'm going to throw you out! Why you? Of all the people in this world to pick on, why pick on my son? For money? Dad stop it please! You want to get into my family's money, is that it, or you just like them young, what? Oh. I'm thinking it was about the money. It was about the money right? You read about my kid in the papers about to go to jail, suddenly you show up out of the blue with this miraculous solution What, wait, I thought my dad went to you? She told you that, that's bullshit! You were a ticket to fund her fucking program. You get money from my father to put me in the program? Tell me that wasn't all planned? Let's get out of here Shawn. Tell him the truth. She can't. Just tell him you love me. Just that much. Please. -Shawn. -No, no, no. Lady, you slept with my son, the addict in your care. I know what I seem like to people, because I have money, like toys, woman, whatever. It leaves the wrong impression, all I really care about, is Shawn. I'll do anything, to protect him. [foreign language] [language continues] [doll thuds] [eerie music] Hello Prof. Dalton, this is Audrey from the probation services again, Shawn Wittig is still skipping his mandatory meetings in our office and his therapy sessions. Listen it's urgent that you call me as soon as possible and let me know if he's reported back to you since we spoke last, okay thank you. [loud retching] Shawn... [knocking] [breathing heavily] Shawn, I'm worried. [eerie music] [keys jingle] [door creaks] See I knew these would come in handy again someday. [INDISCERNIBLE] [door closes] Shawn? -Oh my god! -Are you kidding me? Shawn? That exactly a man of material needs, huh. Hey, honey. Do you know a Tammy Boyle? [suspenseful music] [engine whirring] Oh boy! -Hi! -Time out guys. What did you take? I told him, only to have one. That's what I had! But one wasn't enough buzz for him. Okay, calling for an ambulance. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? Ed, wrap cage and get out of here. -I don't want to go! -Oh for gods sakes! [moans] How many pills did you take? What do you care? Stay awake with me. Don't worry, I didn't try to kill myself, I'm ok, just go away. Shawn Look at me. Look at me. I love you. I... love you. [eerie music] What do you love about me? You're sweet, tender, thoughtful, please, you can't die yet. My love, please [crying] You going to break my heart, aren't you? [suspenseful music] Listen, about all the drinking and everything, I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself. [hush] [eerie music] [deep breath] [sighs] That's the problem. You'll never stop. Not this way at least. [music continues] [kettle whistles] Want some lunch? No, I'm still not hungry. Drink. The tea will make you feel better. [grunts] You know what I'm hungry for? Not until you drink some. It's for your own good. Trust me. If you won't do it for yourself, then do it for me. Drink [forceful glugging] Delicious. [both laughing] You happy now? Abso-fucking-lutely. [eerie music] [music fades] [shorts breaths] What's this? I've never told anyone. Only my parents knew, and Vicky. Because they were there. But... now my parents are gone, so Sammy was just a kid, and so was I. I was so young, Oh my god. Samantha. You're her sister. I'm her mother. You have to understand, being an only child, and very traditional Chinese parents I was wildly rebellious, got pregnant at 13, despite them. I didn't even bother to find out who the father was. Completely unacceptable to their affluence sort of cronies. So they claimed Samantha as their daughter, took control of both of us and, moved us out of China town. Turns out, Sammy was... even more free spirited than I was. So beautiful. Hard to resist wasn't she. [coughing uncontrollably] I'm sorry. But, how do I know you are? This is revenge. This is all a lie. Oh my god. The tea. Poison. I love you. And I forgive you. [sobbing] [loud drum] No...no... Wake up! [sobbing] Wake up! Wake up. Wake up! [sobbing] No... Wake up. [gentle music] I would've given you my life. She didn't want that, For you to die you know. Maybe, she actually did fall in love with me and, decided to kill herself instead. I don't know, it takes a long time to die by deuterium oxide. So, whatever plan she made, she did it a long time ago. Didn't you ever notice, she kept you away from the wine? That's where she kept the D2O. I thought it was just because of my addictions. God no. It was because of her addiction. She was just so completely haunted by Samantha's death, She couldn't let it go. Do you know what she was planning? Frankly I thought she was going to kill you. So, she wanted me to love her and loose her. Or maybe, she just wanted to transform you so that you'd actually have a conscience. And then you'd have to suffer the same pain she felt, after what happened to Sammy. Or maybe she just wanted to save all those other girls from you repeating the same fucking mistake over and over again. Hey... maybe she just simply loved you? What the fuck! Doesn't really matter either way, bitch broke all our hearts. [orchestral music] [Asian song] [song ends]
