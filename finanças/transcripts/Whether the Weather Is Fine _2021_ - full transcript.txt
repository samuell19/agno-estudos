Ma? Pa? Are you there? Another storm is coming. Brace yourselves. Fuck, it's hot. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. If you can hear this announcement… Again, if you can hear this announcement, please evacuate your homes because another storm will hit the city. Proceed to the nearest evacuation center. Let's go! Dreaming of me? Sexy? I know you were thinking of me. Don't be shy. I'm good with that. I was worried about you. I thought you were dead. Let's leave Tacloban before the next storm hits tomorrow. Aren't you tired? I'm exhausted. Andrea. Will you pop my pimple? Really? You'll do it? Soldiers say there's a ship that will take survivors to Manila. But we need to register to get on. Where? By the port. We need to get on that list. Wow, so useful in a storm! Let's move. Hear that? Hear what? Try to open that. With this? I told you to stay put. I got this. Don't hurt him. Please. The chickens. We want both. Fine. Take it, you piece of shit. Slaughter it. Andrea. What was that? What's gotten into you? I had no choice. He had a knife. No choice? An old man and a kid? An old man with a knife. People are murderous these days. We have to stick together... The two of us, no matter what. I will never leave you. Sure. But give me the gun. Andrea. Give me the gun! Andrea! So dirty! We'll be on TV. We have to be neat. Hold this. Each day at three o'clock in the afternoon, the Philippines pauses for a brief moment of prayer for peace and forgiveness of sins. Three o'clock in the afternoon is the hour of great mercy. At this time, our Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross and redeemed the world. Let us now get our prayer leaflets ready so we may pray all together the three o'clock prayer. Let us pray. You died, Jesus, but the source of life flowed out for souls and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fountain of Life, immeasurable Divine Mercy, cover the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us. O Blood and Water, which flowed out from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of mercy for us, I trust in You. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, Have mercy on us, and the whole world. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us, and the whole world. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us, and the whole world. Amen. Jesus, King of Mercy, we trust in You. Mama! Mama! Sit down. Here. Eat. Thanks. Just half, okay? Thanks anyway. Where were you, Ma? Looking for you. I've gone everywhere. Can I get more? I'm hungry, Ma'am Norma. That's enough. I don't know if we'll get anything else to eat. How are you, son? I had a feeling you'd be okay. I was sure. We were scared thinking that you died, ma'am. You looked for her before me? I was here first but you weren't. And it was Andrea who found me. Of course she did. Don't be like that, Ma. Now that we're together, let's leave together. Another storm is coming. It might be worse. It's no longer safe here. Ma'am, there's a ship coming from Manila. You want to go to Manila? What's left here? It's nice there, Ma'am Norma. Star of Christmas. Thank you for the light. That makes the season bright. Thank you for your light. That brings this season back to life. No one else can give this light. Nobody, nobody but You. Merry Christmas, ma'am! Please, Ma. Everyone's going. Andrea. We're missing a chicken. Missing? It was just in the bag. It's not here. Are you sure? It should be there. Well, it's not. Leave it be. Let's go! Motherfucker! Have you seen my mother? Ma, don't mind her. Let's go. Ma'am Norma, can you please walk faster? Sure! Attack, sink that ship! Beep, beep! Hello, good afternoon! Maybe we should pray a bit too. Lord, help me. Listen to my cry. - I've suffered my whole life. - What's this? We don't have time for this bullshit. I am tired. God, give me rest. My faith in You is strong. I know you will show mercy. Aren't you a neighbor of Luis Santos? Yes, he lives across from our house. That's why you look familiar. Is he okay? Where is he? No idea. Honestly, my family is just trying to survive. But he could be at the rescue center near our area. Damn it! I can't hear her. That's all I know, sorry. How are you related? Ma, what was that about? Nothing. I just lost it. Why don't you both go straight to the registration center? Get us on the list while I get food and water at the rescue center. We need the relief. We should go. Enough drama, let's go! Don't be stupid, you're wasting candles. Mind your own candle. The sun's out. Light it when it's dark and just pray without a candle now! Hey, that's our bike. It's mine. No, it's ours. Chill. I want to learn how to ride. Ma, it's my turn to sing. No! I know where I could work in Manila. A club. Imagine me performing there. It's not what you think. It's a proper, classy music club. My friend could set me up. Please? We could have fun and make lots of money. I kept telling Papa. I'd rather be a seaman. To be at sea. - I want to go places… - Fuck you. You can't even move if your Ma's not there. Baby boy! Baby. Seaman? You can't even swim… Janitor's fine. Miguel, one last thing. Is this the Santa Maria rescue center? Are they letting people in? Why let them in before us when we got here first? What's going on? We discourage everyone from sharing unverified information. Please always refer to our official statement. Thank you very much. MERRY CHRISTMAS Eduardo. What do you want, Norma? I'm sorry, I just wanted to ask, have you seen Luis? Please, Eduardo. I haven't seen him. Will you tell me if you do? Eduardo, please. I'm asking you. I know I hurt you a long time ago, but… Please help me. Ask the guy over there with a list. Sir, I need help. I'm looking for my husband, Luis Santos. And? He might be here. Can you check your list? Oh, the list. Sorry. - Luis Santos? - Yes. Obet… Sorry, he's not listed. Maybe try another rescue center. - But you're not sure he's there. - No. You're asking too much. I can only answer for this area. But what do you think? He could still be at home. Some people refused to evacuate. So you're clueless? Give me that. And the box. Matches, please. Matches too? Quick! Just one. And the bag of supplies. - I'll take three. - Three? Faster! Stop wasting my time. If we don't find anything else, let's go straight to the rescue center. What tattoo did you get? The tattoo is… A blob of yin and yang. You know yin and yang? I could finish it for you. We're here, anyway. Let me finish it for you. Take your shirt off. Just take it off. Ouch. Don't be a softie. Trust me, I'm great at this. Great? Whatever. Andrea, not too hard. That hurts. It really hurts. Don't you wonder how your papa is doing? Papa? No. But he should be fine. Wherever he is. What if he died? Bless his soul then. We haven't spoken in ages because he's with his new family. Andrea. I just want to leave this miserable place with you and Mama. WHETHER THE WEATHER IS FINE Fuck you! Norma! Come here. I have something to tell you. How do you know my name? I saw Luis being brought to a rescue center. He looked ill and in pain. There was blood on his shirt. Where did they take him? To the Astrodome where they take in the wounded. Take this. This is mine. My husband is inside. I need to see him. - Please let me in. - But, ma'am, no one's allowed to enter. But I need to see my husband. He needs me, so please let me in. Ma'am, we understand. But sanitary measures prevent us from letting anyone in. What is this queue? They're waiting for those who were admitted here to be discharged. I just want to know if my husband is fine. Ma'am, we can't give that information. But we'll let you know once we are told to. Sorry, ma'am. No, you're not sorry. All right, ma'am. How about we give you information but… Shut up! Stop saying you're sorry. Will I even see him if I join the line? You can try but no promises. Join the line, but don't blame me if you don't get to see him. Then why are you saying sorry? - Fine, we're not sorry. - You don't even know what sorry means. Goodbye then. Just leave her. Bitch! Sorry, ma'am. Only the wounded are admitted. You're not allowed to go inside. But I need to see my husband. Sorry, ma'am. Please step back. Only wounded patients. Everyone, get in line. The ones on the side, move to the back. Why are you still on the side? Form a proper line. We had a celebration. So I had people over. But there were so many unexpected guests! Mama was unnerved because The cutlery was not enough. And so I found a way. By using my fingers, I just fingered it. No spoons or forks on the table. So using my fingers, I just fingered it. Since my friends were already hungry. We want to clarify that the news about an approaching storm is false. Again, there is no storm approaching. Let us stick to facts and keep calm. What's going to happen? Son, there's nothing we can do. Nothing makes sense anymore. Where do we register? It's every man for himself. There's no more order. Just proceed to the port. The ship's sailing soon. Try to board if it's possible. What the fuck was that? Let's go. Andrea, are you insane? I'm not leaving without Mama. We must find her. [INCOMPREHENSIBLE LANGUAGE] DELICIOUS TACLOBAN! Listen to me. We're facing a disaster that we could not have foreseen. But if we work together, we can solve and overcome this crisis. Let us not fight over food because there is enough for everyone. Please maintain order and follow procedure. Thank you very much! Where could she be? I told you this was a shitty plan. Don't worry. Your mama knows what she's doing. She's probably looking for someone… She must be with your papa. That's what she's been up to. What do you mean? Well, waiting here is pointless. Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck you! - Stay out of this, shitty girl! - Who are you calling shitty? You want a fight? Shit. Back off! The bike! Fuck! We have to find Mama. It's dangerous out there. Andrea? Hey. Andrea! We're not breaking up, okay? She healed the dog. She brought the dog back to life! She just performed a miracle. Rejoice, our savior is here! Rejoice, our savior is here! Our savior is here! Our savior is here! Rejoice, our savior is here! Come. You're bleeding… Just like your papa. HONESTY IS THE BEST Miguel. Miguel, wake up. We have to go. I'm finally awake. Reawakened. I had forgotten how it feels. I am still alive. Miguel. Only the wounded are admitted to the Astrodome. Please, so I can see him. Please do it for me, Miguel. I beg you. I need to see Luis. Mama, have you gone insane? Help. I just want to get inside, find him, and say goodbye. Then, let's meet on the ship. It's a promise. Stop it, Mama. I can't leave without telling your papa. We never said goodbye. Don't do this, Ma. This is my only chance. Miguel. Please. - Ma, you don't have to. - Please, Miguel. Get a rock. Get a rock. Pick it up! No, I won't. Let's get out of here. Get a rock. Get a rock. Do it! I can't! Just do it! Get a rock. Miguel! Do it! Do it! Stop this, Ma! Let's get out of here. Miguel. I won't do it. Please don't make me do it. Take it! - Do it! - No! - Just do it. - Let's not do this, Ma! - Miguel! Just do it. - Ma, I don't want to! Miguel! Take it. Miguel! Just do it. Let's move. Thank you. The port is near. I will wait for you there. Sir, I'm sorry, you're not allowed inside. They're leaving. Let's go! Run, the ship is here! We're going to die! Ma! No need to panic. A ship has docked, but more ships will arrive. Those inside the center need not worry. More ships will be arriving. There is room for everyone. But the sick and the wounded shall be prioritized. Please be patient until the next ship arrives. Thank you very much. Mama. Mama. Let's go home, Ma. Mama. No need to worry, there is no storm. Keep calm and be patient. Don't panic. I repeat, there is no storm. No cash, just window-shopping. Looking at posters but not the movies. Just enough money to get by. Two cigarettes' worth. Even in the darkness I wait for your arrival. Anxious when you are not around. We cherish every moment. As with birds, our love has freedom. That tastes as sweet as the sky. Every heartbeat feels as sweet. As when we're singing a song. Now that you're in my arms again. I'd touch even the tears of love. Just as wind kisses water from a spring. Love is light in life. As with birds, our love has freedom. That tastes as sweet as the sky. Every heartbeat feels as sweet. As when we're singing our love
