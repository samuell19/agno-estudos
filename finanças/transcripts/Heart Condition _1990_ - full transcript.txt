You know, you can't get away from me This is a very good-looking car I mean, this is absolutely fabulous Has it ever been washed? It's weird, I know, it's very weird I'm not even used to it myself It's kind of like that out-of-body... you know, astral-projection, Shirley Maclaine thing I mean, one minute... I'm sitting in the front seat of my car, and I'm dying Next time I know... boom! I'm standing in the operating room looking at myself... while they're pulling my heart out of me I mean, it was like that... What's the name of that movie? Oh, this is very good, this is good Going back and forth is good because it stimulates the heart It makes you a lot strong... Are you listening to me? You are listening to me? Hey, wait a minute You're ignoring me, aren't you? Now, listen, I didn't want my heart in you... any more than you wanted my heart in you... and if I knew that my heart was gonna be... inside a piece of racist scum like you... I never would've donated it in the first place But that's OK, you know, because life's a bitch... and then you die, you know? It's true, isn't it? Hey... but I didn't die! I was murdered!

Say yes, you want to wind up in a mental institution? Jack? Yes! Yeah, it's working fine It's OK Jesus! Chuck! Personally, I think that this racism this refusal to acknowledge me... stems from feelings of inadequacy I mean, you look at me What do you see? Someone college-educated, damn good-looking... hung like a Shetland pony, and you feel threatened Am I hitting a nerve? Come on, Chuck Oh, I see, you can talk to the cat, but you can't talk to me Get out of the way, Shithead Ohh! You can talk to me, thank you Racial prejudice I can understand... but ghost prejudice? An entirely new concept As a matter of fact... I think you're breaking new ground in this area Hey!
