Don’t you get it? There’s a court order saying... you have to stop throwing debris downhill? What else is there to say? What else? You almost drowned me! OK, don’t shout! You’ll drive me mad. You’ll drive me mad, huh? You’ll drive me mad, fuckers. Where are you? Where the hell are you? Where the hell are you? Only I can see you? Nikitas! Turn it off! Are you Nikitas? Turn it off! Are you Nikitas? What do you want? I’ve been looking for you. Who sent you? Got any tobacco? What? Tobacco, for a smoke. You weren’t expecting me, were you? “I, Eleni Douka, with this written will, wish to name my son, John Doukas, as the sole legal beneficiary of all my property after my death. The joint ownership of 40,000 square meters of land shared with my ex-husband Nikitas Kontaxis.” Fifty percent. It’s legit. By the book. Are we clear? You didn’t know she died, right? THE MONSTER WISHES YOU HAPPY IMMIGRATION PROTEST AGAINST THE MONSTER LOOTER OF NATURE -Here come the mercenaries. -I can see them. -All set for the protest tomorrow? -We’re ready. -Expecting a crowd. -OK, good. Hey, old buddy! What brings you here so late? I have a tick here. -A tick? -Yes. Pull it out. There’s nothing there. It’s the booze. -Look, it’s a tick. -Sure. What’s up with you? Did you pull through yesterday? They almost drowned me. All the mud went right into the farm. -Nothing’s sacred to those fuckers. -What can I do? Let’s have a drink. Calm down a bit. -This raki is killer. -Give me some to go. Hey, Mr. Nikitas. -How are you, Alex? -All good. Yourself? Look at you! You’ve grown so much! -It’s just been a month. -But you have grown. -What are you on about! -Where are my slippers? -Under there! -Under the table. Why can’t I find them? Come here you. Where’s your helmet? There, look! Golden hair! That’s bad luck! Get out of here, you punk. The little shit! They grow up so fast. And turn into assholes. Sit. Sit, will you? A guy was looking for you at the gas station. On an Enduro bike. Did he come back? No. I filled his tank and he disappeared into the forest. Who was he? Did he find you? -He didn’t come back today? -No, man. I even thought it might be your kid. Then I thought it was the company sending some muscle, so I sent him the other way. That’s why he didn’t find you. C’mon. Let’s have one for the dead. Tell me. Get me a bottle and I’ll leave. I see. Man, he’s a rider. And he fixed my bike. Where are you from, lad? I was born here. Left when I was a kid. Why are they shouting? Cut the crap. Who sent you? He’s Nikitas’ son. Returning to the fatherland. Good for you, buddy. I’m Petros. I’ll feed you to the dogs, asshole! We’re coming down, fuckers! I’m nobody’s son. And where have you been? Away. A lot of things have changed since you left. Ignore this shit. Since the company came to our village, people are smiling again. Those shouting outside are all loaded. See you. Enemies of the mines are our enemies. Pick your side. Where are you going? Stay out of it. It won’t get you anywhere. Are you here to stay or... just passing through? Neither. I’m Mary. Sit. MY WILL “I, Nikitas Kontaxis, leave... all my property... the house, the trees, the chickens, the horse, to my son, who lives with his mom, somewhere in Crete.” Nice chicks. If I knew you had a harem, I would have understood. So would I, if I knew about your news. Come here, Callie. I’ve got more news. The bank is taking mom’s house. My house, that is. Everyone pays someday. Give me 20,000. That’s my share, the lawyer said. Hand it over and I’m out of here. Come back here. I’ll get you. Every day the same thing! You’re finished! Come here! -The fruit is here! -Sit down, dumbass. Morning, lads. Hello, Themakos. -It’s been ages, Nikitas. -Where have you been? Where have you been? I’ve called you 15 times. Why won’t you answer the phone? I need walnuts, chestnuts... Where have you been? Walnuts, chestnuts, nuts! Why won’t you answer the phone? Give the chicken to the guys. I’ve been calling you, man. Bring the chicken. Put the red apples, the walnuts and the chestnuts over there. The apples go on top. I’ll tell you where to stick ’em! Down, next to the broccoli. When I find the strength, I’ll pick some and bring them over. -You have an assistant now. -What about yours? Mine also makes coffee. -Your coffee is horse piss. -Fuck off. Your coffee is horse piss. Who is she? Is that Lena? Lena! You said you wouldn’t join them. And you put on the uniform for money? -Why the uniform? -How else am I supposed to live? You have no shame, all high and mighty? Yeah, so high and mighty! Go back sell your tangerines. Don’t come back here! Enough is enough. -You’ll start a fire, dumbass. -Sit your dumb ass down! That’s a day’s pay. -That’s peanuts. -My lawyer disagrees. Take 20 now. And step by step, you’ll make it. We worked the farm for years with your mother, you know. Sometimes we wouldn’t eat until it was pitch-dark. Touch here. Sandpaper. Touch here. That’s sandpaper. NOT FOR SALE Close the door! For me? Don’t you like them? -I’m not a slipper person. -Why? I just don’t like slippers. You come inside, you wear slippers. To keep the house clean. -It’s full of mud, anyway. -You know something? Enough with this. You come in, you put slippers on. End of story. And in the forest too? What would you know about the forest? Forest? Check this out. On a tour in the Balkans. This one is in Austria. Portugal. 42 bikes. France. The teen cup. The cup? Gold. Gold, huh? That’s my ex. She’s pretty, but skinny. Do you have a girl now? -Would I be here if I did? -No, you’d be in some girl’s... I can help. You’ll find me a chick? I can fix stuff. The chainsaw. Anything. Oh, really? I’m a mechanic. So what? I worked in a garage for years. -I fix things. That’s what. -So what? So a paper came saying you owe me. That’s what. I don’t want. -No salt? -I don’t want salt. I go to the market with no eggs to sell. OK? It’s been a week now. So... I come here, and I don’t get an egg to eat. I feed you all day long. You have to... Tell me who is stealing your eggs. Is it a squirrel? A fox? A gorilla? Cut it out. Agreed? -He’s good. -Told you, he’s a champion. Johnny the “jampion”. Look at that dude. Billy has his own “airbags” if he falls. My friend Katerina. You son of a bitch, You’ll end up in a ditch! You fuck with me, You fuck with death... Cuz I rap till my last breath... I’ll take you where The sun don’t shine, Show you how we do it Down in the mine! So many people we lost, Life keeps getting bleaker... Play it loud now, Burst the loudspeaker! -Pork steak from the mines. -Outta da mines? Very nice. Look at it. It’s amazing, isn’t it? Do you know what it’s called? Mother tree. Mother. It’s one tree, and all these other trees come out of it. See? -It’s different. -Different. -Guess how old it is. -How old? Sixty... sixty-five. Like you. Yes, more or less. See? A squirrel. One of the last. Winter is here, so you won’t see many left. He’ll go hide. He’s calculating speed, distance, strength... Everything is rhythm, you know. It’s about what your eyes see, not what your mind sees. However, a friend once told me, if the mind doesn’t see, the eye won’t either. Tighter, give the sound more space. Hear that? Hear that? Digging and drilling. The monster is coming, eating everything up. The most dangerous animal in this forest is us. DANGER: UNSTABLE GROUND Look. They cut it down. This is my walnut tree! The bastards cut it down to take measurements for the road. Poor tree, look at this. Look at this! Ripped out for no reason. What’s this? Pink rolling papers. It’s them. Start loading, it’s raining. Anyone here smoke with pink rolling papers? How would I know? One of you smokes pink rolling papers. Hey, guys! -Anyone smoke pink cigarettes? -Which of you is it? -Why? -You cut down my walnut tree. And you were smoking pink cigarettes, get it? Sir, I’m in charge. What’s the problem? And what did you do about it? Look... Wait a minute! If we made a mistake we’ll pay for it. How will you pay for it? -The company will. -You want to buy me off! Why did you cut the walnut tree down? -Again if we... -Why did you cut down my tree? -Piss off, get out of here! -Why did you cut it? -Sir, I repeat... -And you listen to me! I’ve been growing it since it was this big. No one gives a shit! Stop asking for trouble. Leave! I bring them here that little, plant them, for you to come and cut them down! Get on with it! We have other things to do! What the hell! Get in your car and go! Leave, for your own good. We’ve had enough of you! You should be ashamed. Shame on you! Why? Why what? When the monster intrudes on our home, digs and throws all that toxic waste in our backyard, what do you expect? If you break nature’s balance, you get weather outbreaks, civil wars... That’s how it goes. Look around. Look at this place. This is where I wanted you to grow up. I fell in love with this place long before I met your mother. But you need to love the forest a lot to endure it. You need strength to stay here. She got tired. She had enough. She missed the sea. She’d had enough. One day she took you and left. Better she took you away and gave you a normal life. And I stayed behind... guarding and loving this place twice as hard. That’s why! Morning, Nikitas, Johnny. Hey, Petros. We discussed your issue about the landslides. -Management took it into account. -So? We can’t control the forest, but I’m here to tell you that the offer on your land is still valid and has increased by 25%. Did you tell them to put up trunks to stop the mud from running down? Yes, but there’s nothing we can do. We can’t control the forest. The important thing is that the offer is 25% higher. Twenty-five thousand? Two hundred thousand Euros. It’s their final offer, Nikitas. Come on, guys, two hundred isn’t good enough? We’ve never made an offer like that to anyone. We’ve known each other for years. Please. I don’t want anything bad to happen. I can’t help you anymore. It’s your last chance. Get out of here. And tell your boss, the company, everybody... They’re not getting their hands on my land. Not even after I’m dead. Tell them to follow the court order. In any case, my bosses are going to get their way. You figure it out. They offer two hundred. I wish I could pay them to get out of here. You wish. Whatever. They cut, I plant. Playing the hero? Alone against the world? The earlier you understand you’re alone, the better. I don’t get you. Listen, come here. This thing itches like hell. -Scratch me. -What is it? That tick. Scratch me. -What tick? -Right there, scratch. -But it’s a mole. Stop scratching. -It’s a tick. It’s a mole, stop scratching. I have the same here, look. -Look. -I know. So don’t scratch it either. CUT DOWN A TREE, I’LL CUT OFF YOUR HAND, PUNK -What’s up? -Nice ride! -Nice... wagon. -I’ll take you for a ride. Ride by the bar sometime. -Hello, Nikitas. -Hi, darling. -This is for you. -Thanks. -How are you? -All good. Bye. She fancies me. You wish, you old cow. She’s a fine girl though. -He thinks the girl fancies him. -As if! How can you think that? I don’t care about these. You don’t care, but I do, man! You like it? It was my dad’s. -“Grandma Enduro”. -“Grandma Enduro”? -It’s a “granny”. -My bike, a “granny”? It’s a ’74 model. -What is it, then? -She’s not a granny. Cool, we should go for a ride on our bikes. I can easily get you drunk, you know. Go on then. -Tell them the news. -Are you kidding me? Not now. Why don’t you say anything? Cat got your tongue? What do you want, Thodora? -Stay here and rot? -Yes. I’m staying here. You do as you please. Come on, tell your friends. Did he sell? -Did you sell? -Yes. I sold it. It was the last chance. Gamer over. -What are you talking about? -Folks, get a grip. We can’t fight the monster. Game over. No, they think we quit! But we are still fighting! I’ve been fighting since day one, so what? We’re beating up the air. The game is over for me. -It’s not over for me! -Go on then! Fight the miners! Like it’s their fault. Not their fault? They’re selling out! Selling is not selling out! Breaking balls is not having balls. I’ve got balls, man. I’m leaving to start a new life. Thodora, I can’t live in this rut anymore. C’mon, let’s get out of here. Fuck off and fuck you! I don’t want to see you again! We should’ve been all united! With the miners too. Now it’s too late. Why don’t you say anything, Nikitas? -Say what? -Anything. Like what? Kostas-Thodora, Nikitas-Eleni. He knows how it goes. He’s dried out. What can he say? What a song! Here’s to my old buddy! Don’t drink that, it’s full of ashes. Eleni’s ashes. He looks just like his mom. You forgot to show up? Went for a walk or what? Eleni is dead. Dead? Really? I thought she was dead to you long ago. So did I, until recently. -He’s got your eyes, though. -But not your balls. I’m not so sure. He found the courage to come. While I sit here and wait. Without even knowing why. Maybe I should just leave. Go! I don’t get it, why are you waiting? Sell and go away. You’re an ass, that’s why you don’t get it. I’m doing it for us, so we can start fresh. You’re doing it for you. She’s right, asshole. Enough of your shit. I love it here. It’s a great place. Great place... a rotting shed. It’s not a shed. This is the last bastion. If it falls, a lot of people will be disappointed. I used to love this place. -You used to come here? -My mom would bring me. -Where was I? -You had left. Ever thought staying in one place doesn’t make sense? -Ever thought nothing makes sense? -Many times. Before I fall asleep, I look at the ceiling, and the sound of my bike starts roaring in my head. You’ll break the swing, idiot. Your father used to work in the old underground mines. Along with his brother and my dad. They were best friends. Until the accident. One of the entrances collapsed. Twelve people died. It was a big thing in the village. Who died? Nikitas’ brother, my dad and ten others. Nikitas gave up everything and moved up here. He became a guard. Is it raining? It’s the leaves. Do that again. That just came out of you? C’mon, let’s go. Go on! A tenner. Are we betting? Mary, you too. -It’s all I’ve got. -What’s that? I’ll throw in for Johnny. -What? -Have you no shame? It’s just money. I’m gonna win the pot. Win, my ass. That’s how it’s done. Yeah right, you’re still a grunt. While you could buy this place ten times over. They’re hiring with a two-grand wage and he’s sleeping. Tell him, Petros. What? He knows my door is open if he wants a chat. -Two grand? -Yeah. If I were you, I’d sell my share and scram. Let him be, man. I’ll tell you a secret. Sit down. Without your land, it will cost them ten times more to build the new roads. We’re talking about serious money. You could even ask for double. Make him sign. You are losing too. You’re up. Think about it. And you need to be careful. A lot of the guys are angry and tired of playing nice with Nikitas. Good boy. Good boy. It drives me crazy. I can’t stand this noise anymore, I’ve told you! The animals get scared, the chicken scatter, there’s no eggs... -What am I supposed to do? -What? Turn it off earlier. We’ve been through this so many times. Horses aren’t like dogs. You have to earn their trust. I used to sing this to you every night before putting you to bed. And when you couldn’t sleep, we’d put you in the orange truck, the Datsun, a historic model, and drive you round and round... Like what you’re doing now. Not feeling sick yet? Get away from this place. Go have a normal life. Go where? I have my trees here. My horse, my chickens, my dog. What would I do with them? They’re like children to me. That’s why you never visited? Take this jacket, it was your mom’s favorite. I lost your mother, you didn’t. I lost her. She dumped you. Did she have another man? Me. Did she ever mention me? Did she ever... talk about me? That’s the best part. Too salty. Listen. If you keep digging holes... one here, one there... you’ll get nowhere. Pick one and start digging. Dig, dig, and dig. And you might get somewhere. You might find something. It’s your call. Where will it get me? Just sell and give me my share to pay off my house, and get it over with. My call, are you kidding me? You owe me. What do I owe you? You were the one calling, all these years. You couldn’t even say hi. I could smell your stinky breath through the phone. It stunk all the way from up here... where you dug and planted, full of shit and mud, beating the air! Two-bit hero. Congrats to your mother who raised you normally. But because you came out of my balls too, and since we are talking man-to-man you can grab my balls and fuck off where you came from. You see what I mean. MINING ZONE - SECURITY CHECK Put the bucket back in. You’ll be a star, I can tell. Softly. Like caressing a woman. Good job, my boy! C’mon, your turn, we don’t have all night. Wait. You kill one monster, another pops up. Like the Hydra. Burn them all to the ground and get it over with. It served you right. What did you expect? The man is straight, you’re not. He can go fuck himself. -You’re like him. -Like him? -You’re both stubborn. -He’s an animal. You’re the animal! Walking around in that uniform in his face. Why do that? What do you want? Why are you still here, boy? What do you care? Right, what do I care... Good luck with that. It’s my fault. It was my decision. Nature is taking its revenge on me, I guess. Are you nuts? How much will you ask? Fifty, 100, enough for the kid. You’re crazy. They offer 200. Why ask 100? Just enough for the kid to pay up his debt. It’s his house anyway. Before I get an axe and start chopping heads off. I may move to the other side of the hill. It’ll be quieter. On that piece of land, over at Eptalofos. -Grandpa’s land. -Grandpa’s land? Yes. You crazy? Not a chance. It’s Nikitas asking, not some sellout fucker. -No way. -Calm down. He wants to sell out like Kostas. Enough with me, stop busting my balls. He is being responsible. I’ll ask 80, give 60 to the kid to pay his debt, and 20 for your land. No way. End of story. Give him the land! Gonna take it to the grave? You got no kids, no pets. -Why not give him the land? -Leave grandpa alone! Hey, quiet down! Let’s not start again. -Come on, let’s go. -Hold on. Calm down. Let’s start again. Forty is the objective value, right? Plus 40 for personal labor. I moved everything up there myself. Put 80 down, 80. Forty apple trees. Kiwis too... I grow them drop by drop. -Walnut trees. -Walnuts with nuts! Don’t laugh, it’s the best variety. That’s another 20 thousand. Be quiet. I can’t think. That’s another 20 thousand. 100 total, right? Any offer to make, Thodora? 80, 100, whatever... -Why not make an offer? -Shut up, dumbass! Ask for 400 and buy a pickup truck, or whatever you need. -I don’t want a pickup. -Why not get a new pickup? Sold. The end. Out you go! Let’s not forget the fucking taxes. No way around those dickheads. 120, done! Grab your contract and let’s go. -Get out! Out! -Let’s go! It’s going to be a big day! You all turned into real estate agents now. You’re doing the right thing, thinking of the kid. We should take care of our children, at least they should be well. Still here? C’mon, lads. Well said, let’s go. Here...! Be careful. Don’t step in. Fucking hell. Fuck. Hold tight. Come on! Grab it. It’s OK, kid. -It’s OK. -What? We have the same luck, you and me. Good and bad. Sorry, I wasn’t ready. You weren’t ready? -Does it matter? -Not really... I’ll miss you though. Fuck it. I wanted to do that for some time, but never found the courage. Good job. NOT FOR SALE Got any tobacco? What? Tobacco, for a smoke.
