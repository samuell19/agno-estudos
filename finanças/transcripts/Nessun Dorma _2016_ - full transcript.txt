Many girls think they're a princess in distress, and if a prince comes to her rescue, she'll live happily ever after But Turandot is not just any princess She sets conditions Whoever rescues her must solve 3 riddles Any wrong answer... results in death The princess wants to be rescued, but not by a moron Don't mess up your make-up, many reporters are out there waiting You know that ring won't look good in photos It's too small You'll find it embarrassing, not me Yes, I agree, I'll talk with him about that - Good night - Yes!

Your mom says we're on the cover, she's very happy But some relatives told her that... your ring is as tiny as a mustard seed Yet her uncle's new daughter-in-law's is as big as an egg Your mom finds it OK herself She just wants you to be the happiest bride Never mind about her Really? She's very aggressive Actually she's right about it Try it on I haven't seen it myself, Cheung has just got it back It looks pretty big I decided to live on my own because of my mom I know Let me see it on you But it doesn't mean the same any more The old one looks quite all right I bought both, change it Change this?

You've been yawning all night long That opera was long and boring, and I don't speak French It was in Italian, Turandot The only opera set in China Puccini blends Chinese folksongs into the melody, too But is there a problem with the princess? She seems to hate men All the men going after her are princes with high status and power There's an explanation for that Some man raped the princess' ancestor Was there a rape scene? I must've fallen asleep It could have been more entertaining If there was such a scene, I'd enjoy it more Yes? What? I'll be there as soon as I can Going out so late at night? Business is business How else could I earn the ring and the homeless dog food money? I hate to say goodbye OK Good night - Good night - Good night Cheung! Cheung! Time to go Miss Tsang A friend of yours left an envelope for you Thank you Miss Tsang, I'm quitting in 2 days Why?

Thank you Take care [Fong Mo Chit] [Fong Mo Chit] Why did you give me back the keys of the farm? You promised to look after the dogs Sorry! You know I'm getting married next week Don't you have anything to say to me? Really no? What else can I say but "Congratulations!"? Then say it! I can't give you the life you live I don't want us getting together on impulse When the feelings are gone, whoever gets ditched is sad You should understand how pathetic it is to be ditched Jasmine! Many people hope their lives are a constant Everything can be done easier that way Too bad that's not how things go Life is a variable, it has N possibilities... as well as X reasons You wouldn't know how to calculate this equation Sorry! Look me in the eye I want you to look me in the eye, Fong Mo Chit I don't want you to regret it Jasmine! This is the bravest thing I have ever done I know what I'm doing I won't regret it Help! anybody here? anybody here? Let me go! Help! Who are you? Why are you locking me up here? Let me go! I haven't done anything wrong, let me go Don't! [Fong Mo Chit] [Fong Mo Chit] [Love Pets I Come on, be good Excuse me! Excuse me, do you take in dogs here? It doesn't look like a stray It's mine Yours? Why are you giving it away? It's so cute Can you look after it for me? Looking after it is not a problem, on one condition though You must take it home No problems - Here - Thank you What's its name? Pi Pie as in apple pie Pi as in circumference 3.1416 It should be 31415926535897932384... -...62643383279 - Come on in first Pi never ends This way Come over and eat something, Pi Something to eat When was Pi born? I need to jot down its birthday It was born July 13, 2009 Do you know many people don't know their dogs' birthdays? Pi is a Cancer It was born at 2:00 pm That was a Monday, temperature 29, relative humidity 80, average ultra-violet index 5 Do you remember all your friends' birthdays then? Yes! Do you know when I was born? How would I know? How about the date the first dog was taken in here: February 6, 2014 It was a Thursday that day The temperature at 9:00 am that day was 18 degrees relative humidity 89, average ultra-violet index 3, low That's a super party trick, you must be very popular at clubs I've never been to any Let me guess what day of the week you were born? There're 7 days in a week, you have a 1-in-7 chance Monday How did you know? That's why I said you don't need a gift when you're in luck [Fong Mo Chit] [Gifted children of the 80s the Hong Kong] Autistic gifted Fong Mo Chit, broke the record in Asia at the age of 4 [Gifted-children database] Do you need help? There you are! Yeah, come on over. That volunteer couple had a fight and won't come any more I need help in the afternoon I'm free in the afternoons Don't you need to go to work? I haven't got a full-time job yet Are you serious? I'll get you a key then OK How are you, Pi? Good bye, Mr. Fong Good bye Good bye Mr. Fong Hi [Love Pets I Here's your keys, thank you What's all this about? This is the Monty Hall Problem It's about logic and probability; many people argue over it How do you play it? 3 cups are in each row on the desk here An animal is hiding in 2 of the cups, and a car in the 3rd one You pick any 1 cup, and take home whatever is in it The grand prize is the car, of course If so, I should have 1-in-3 chance of getting the car I want no. 2 I'm opening one cup now. It's an animal We still don't know where the car is hiding What's most interesting is... would you switch your choice if you were given another chance? My chance is now 50/50, why would I switch? So you've lost the grand prize It doesn't make sense! Let me choose again I want no. 1 Would you switch? No! Sorry! It's impossible! I seldom have such bad luck Couldn't get the car even with a 50% chance Many people think the same, actually it isn't a 50% chance What is it if the choice between 2 isn't a 50% chance? You have a choice among 3 to start, which means a 1-in-3 chance to guess right, and a 2-in-3 chance to guess wrong Because 2/3 is bigger than 1/3, so the chance of guessing wrong is higher The so called "luck" you mentioned, only means you have a second chance Yet a second chance isn't for everyone Now someone is willing to show you... one of the 2 wrong cups As for the essence of the Monty Hall Problem, If you are given a chance to switch, you should I understand what you're saying, but I don't like your assumption that my choice must be wrong at the start This is not an assumption This is probability, it's the power of Mathematics, it's reliable But you can't use Mathematics to solve everything in life That's why I set up this game to prove to all those who don't believe it Fine! I still believe in myself. Let me prove to you I was right Do it again! I pick no. 2 [Love Pets I Why are you locking me up here? Let me go! Do you want money? I can give you money What are you doing? I can give you money Let me go, let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Marry me! You must cherish what you've got, Miss Tsang What do you mean? You're smart enough to know Has anything happened to Mr. Lee? Hello, Mr. Lee? OK, I'm coming right now ls Mr. Lee going out again? Cheung! Where's Pi? I always ask the helpers to lock the doors - Pi... - Pi...Pi... - Pi...Pi... - Pi... Pi... Stay where you are What happened? Is it Pi? What happened to it? Mimi took Pi home Who's Mimi? My wife She had the postpartum blues Now that Pi is gone, it's gone with her forever You were right Not everything in life can be accounted for Mimi, I came back from school I'm home You get some more sleep, I'll feed the baby What's happen? Let me do it OK Be careful - Wet the towel, please! - OK Mimi! Mimi! Are you OK, Miss Tsang? I want to go home Are you not feeling well? Would you like to go to the hospital? No! What's the problem? You're scaring me! Why didn't you knock first? Can't you see my hands are full? There's gonna be a lot of reporters tomorrow You'll be in the spotlight, so you must look your best Especially this vintage wedding dress Do you know the shipping alone cost me an arm and a leg? It came all the way from France for you to try on, then was flown back for alterations Now it's here again, a real rush The whole world is waiting to see you wear it It's your luck to be my daughter My body was even better when I married your dad I would've been on the front page for sure if I had this dress Put it on then! Nonsense! Mr. Lee Have a sip! Mr. Lee Excuse me, I want to go to the toilet Am)' What's Wrong? Mad at me? You're getting married Marrying her only means keeping her at home, that gives me time to keep you happy here Get in the car See you Thank you - Thank you, Mr. Lee - Bye What's Wrong? Jealous? I just wanted some fun that night Don't be greedy Tsang Sze Man, please! Miss Tsang Doctor Yu Wait outside, please! What would you like to tell me, Miss Tsang? I want some morning-after pills You don't want a baby now? I'm not ready yet OK, you're old enough to do what you want But let me remind you that... taking that pill within 72 hours after sex... still leaves you an 89% chance of getting pregnant Lee Wai San, do you take Tsang Sze Man to be your lawful wedded wife... for as long as you both shall live? I do Tsang Sze Man, do you take Lee Wai San to be your lawful wedded husband... for as long as you both shall live? I do Please exchange your rings What happened to you in the church? L...was very nervous You got a new driver? What happened to Cheung? He quit He didn't do a good job anyway What have you done? Who was he? Who took you to bed?

I couldn't report to the police I don't want any trouble for our families Who knows if you are telling me the truth I'm not lying, every word is true Not lying? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Everything is booked, you're forcing me to marry you Do you know why I wanted to marry you? Because you were clean Don't think you can gang up on me, I won't give you a penny Not your mom either What the fxxk! Let's divorce then It's not up to you Get married today, then a divorce tomorrow What am I, a clown? Why haven't you changed? Don't cry I'll be out there What happened?

Don't worry, I'll get someone to help me out here [Fong Mo Chit] It's OK, take care of your family first Thank you Are you ripping me off, too, John? Are you? Didn't you say you wouldn't come to help out anymore? There are many things one cannot take account of A perfect equation... takes up much time and effort... to test and verify Then the answer turns out to be very simple actually I've come to realize that you were right My choice would be different... if I were given a second chance I should stop myself when something has gone wrong My mind has become clear... since I met you I know I won't be able to take this for too long I'll leave Vincent soon You will be with me, right? We need to talk - I'm busy - I want a divorce I want a divorce now! Do you need a hearing aid? I said... only when I feel like it, wait 6 months! [Have you ever thought of you were a scapegoat?) [Whose scapegoat?] [Vincent Lee] [Are you taking revenge on Lee Wai San?) [Do you think he's a nice man?) [Did you send him the photos?) [You haven't given any answer yet] (No, he isn't] [He should pay for what he has done] [Why should I be punished? I haven't done anything evil] [Would you like to join me?] (How?)

Don't come near me I know what you did You will go to jail What did I do? I have the evidence You are doomed as soon as I push this button Do you know it's rude to steal somebody's phone? - Give me back my phone - You know what you did I'll pay you alimony for that I don't want money Do you know I was raped because of you? You should be punished, not me Are you crazy? Are you OK? I just came to make sure you're OK - Let's go to the police! - No, don't! He got me into all this Will you help me? He must pay for all this I want him dead Dead? - Kill him! - Don't! Don't! Calm down first - I got raped because of him - Don't! He not only showed no sympathy, he beat me. He's a devil I want to kill him Calm down! Let me think Let me think what to do with him We can't go to Love Pets The helpers might show up any time WW "Oi 90 to your place? What are we gonna do? He'll wake up soon What are we gonna do when he wakes up? It's OK, I'll get you a towel first I want to... apologize What I've been thinking to do is... to take revenge of equal value Excuse me, do you take in dogs here? I'm free in the afternoons! I haven't got a full-time job yet Now that Pi is gone, it's gone with her forever Vincent Lee caused Mimi's death That's why you tortured me! What did I do wrong? What did Mimi do wrong then? She worked for Lee She knew he smuggled gold, yet dared not expose him One night he was drunk... and raped her Let me go! Let me go! Don't go to the police I don't want to involve you People in school will gossip about you What's there to be afraid of? I'm not afraid Lee is very well-connected, we can't win The law will protect us It won't help! He might go to jail for some time, but rumors will follow us all our lives Let's not talk about this I don't want to talk about it anymore We never talked about it since then, neither could we go back to the way we were Mimi became totally different She was afraid of people, wanted to be left alone Later on, she got pregnant We never mentioned who the baby's father was Because she was already thinking of suicide Even though she was in such bad shape, I still loved her I wanted the baby I wanted to go back to the life we lived before Little did I know that... she became more and more depressed... after the baby was born Vincent raped Mimi, and you raped me in return Are you gonna kill me to get your equal revenge? I just knocked you unconscious... to frighten you When you report to the police, it would most embarrass Vincent Lee But you didn't What have you done? Vincent has never loved you He feels nothing for you How pathetic! You don't deserve this But the least expected was... I fell in love with you I am sorry Before I got married, I plucked up the courage to go to you... and made myself very clear We will be together when I've fixed Vincent Come on Jasmine I don't think I know you Don't waste my time here Let go of me Do you want to go? You may You may leave... with correct answers to my 3 questions Playing this kind of shit with me! What's my favorite color? Bright colors Money! What color? Green My mom forced me to like green The opera we watched together What language was it in? Italian No! French Last chance French French, French, French It was Italian I'm giving you one more chance What deal do you want? Tell me, how much money do you want? Are you one of us? How much? I have many different connections Say it, how much? How much? No.3 Have you ever loved me? YES, yes! You haven't! Help, help! Your turn Help! Do you remember who Mimi was? It hurts so much! Who? She was the accountant in your company The one you raped She committed suicide I'm hereto make sure she gets justice Don't! Don't! I should be able to get a good sleep tonight Good night Murder is very hard, getting away with it is harder There must be some way Maybe I'll think of one when you wake up [Superintendent Lee] - Go over there and check it out - Yes, Sir! - Go upstairs and take a look - Yes, Sir! She has been in a coma for so long, God knows what drug she took, she's probably not gonna wake up If she does, she'll be charged with the murder of her husband Her husband wasn't a good guy anyway He had a mistress, and smuggled gold But the forensic doctor says this is a very unusual case There was very little blood at the crime scene, it doesn't make sense the victim bled so little For a "rich and famous" murder case like this, it's either about women or money Don't forget he smuggled gold, too, so maybe the triads killed him Check it out over here [Fong Mo Chit] Hello? Fong Mo Chit jumped off a balcony 13 months ago He died? Also his wife jumped off a balcony 2 years ago Different people want very different things Some go for money Some for love Some for justice As for myself, taking this revenge is... simply on somebody's behalf, somebody who helped me before Somebody who meant a lotto me Other than that, I also wanted justice for my sister Mimi is dead, Mimi is dead I'm warning you, you must win today, clear? Yes! You are dead meat if you don't The 1st runner up of The 2nd Hong Kong Mathematical Olympiad Competition for primary schools is... Fong Mo Chit The winner of The 2nd Hong Kong Mathematical Olympiad Competition for primary schools is... Ngai Man Yin Fong Mo Chit! What? Why did you let me win? Because I have many trophies at home already, I'd rather win a friend OK, you got one OK So Fong gained 2 good friends, me and my sister We were a perfect trio We can't win The law will protect us - Wet the towel, please! - OK She has always been a princess in distress, still waiting to be rescued by a prince I didn't lie I truly love her But...my love for her is only one possibility among the probabilities People change from time to time There's no perfect equation for human nature If a choice between two isn't 50/50, what is it then? At the start the choice is 1 out of 3, you have a 1/3 chance to win, a 2/3 chance to lose If you are given a chance to switch, you should I understand what you're saying, but I don't like your assumption that my choice is wrong at the start This isn't an assumption This is probability, it's the power of Mathematics, it's reliable But you can't use Mathematicsto solve everything in life That's why I set up this game to prove to all those who don't believe it Fine! But I still believe in myself. I'm gonna show you I was right Do it again!
