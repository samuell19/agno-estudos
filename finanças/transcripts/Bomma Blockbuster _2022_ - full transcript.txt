[cycle bell ringing] [voice muted] [voice muted] [vehicle hinking at distance] Raju! Dude... Dude... Dude, look at me... Dude. [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] [phone rings continuosly] Tell me... The van our direction department was coming in, met with an accident, sir. Bha... Bloody teenagers! Situation seems little dangerous, sir! We would need some money too... I'll send our assistant director to your house. Please hand him some money, sir! Ok, send him. -Here, take it. -Sir... Ok, sir. -Hey... -Sir? -Did you call me, sir? -Can't say if that will be enough. Take this too. -Call me if you need anything. -Ok, sir. Thank you. -Durga...-Sir? -Is everything ready for the ritual?-Ongoing, sir. -Sir... -What? Haven't you left already? Sir, the story... It's... At that place... Do you want me to read this now? Huh! Get lost. Idiots! No sense of time at all! [phone rings] Brother-in-law... How are you? I came to know about the accident our idiots did... -Is it true? -Yeah, -our direction department guys...-Idiots! Also, you are never that lucky with movies, right? You keep making movies without listening to us. You have already made 15 movies. Now your son wants to try his luck... And you even sold a house to produce his debut movie. Shame on you! Not even a single story of yours had strength in it. Why would public even watch them! [thunder rumbling] I have no answer for Hari Babu's words. Yes, I did a mistake. I made a movie just because I had huge budget. I made a movie just because a star gave me his dates. I made a movie just because I got a star heroine casted. I made a movie just because I got a famous director onboard. The mistake I did all through is that... I never heard or read a story completely. We need a great story to turn a normal hero into a star. We need a great story to turn a normal director into a star director. We need a great story for a producer to make profits. Yes! For a movie to be a hit or a blockbuster... All we need is a story. A great story. THIS IS MY STORY - DIRECTED BY PURI JAGANNADH Sir... Puri sir... Are you wondering why someone whould paste his pictures in a script? The story you are reading is my real story... My life story, sir. Cast whomever you want as the hero in your movie... I don't mind! But while you are reading this book, my image have to be on your mind. I'm from Atchutapuram, near Visakhapatnam. It has nice paddy fields, mountains, beach... ...great humans, blah blah! I'm not going to bore you with all this. Our village is ok. Go fish and you'll know the pain. This is not a vegetable market to bargain! -Keep moving! -No no... I can earn 3 grand on this lot. -Are you selling it or not? -You and your bloody bargains! As if you are the only fisherman around! The hell with them... Let's go get another customer. As if he's giving birth to all the fish in the ocean! You bought them out of the ocean, that's it. Of course, I work hard to fish. I don't get fish by just sleeping with you. This is a common spectacle around here. To know more about me... Ok, you'll know in the next scene. Is he brushing or eating the brush? Hey, I need to talk to you. Put that down and come with me. Why are you selling at 150 instead of 100? So what? That's my wish. Stick to the price my friend had decided. Of course, as he can't do s**t... He stayed home! Stop blabbering. You know very well about him! He told you to sell at 100. Just do that. -No one is buying at even 50. -I'll kick you in the balls! -Yeah, I'll just keep watching, right? -Shut up! The movie is an utter flop! Yet another flop! -As if you can decide that. -We have to decide that, not you. Also, how can you decide if it's a hit or a flop within just two days? Are you instigating a flight? -Of course, let's fight! -Look at the superheroes talk! [commotion] -Why are you coming on to me? -Enough talking! I'll kill you! Hey, you idiots! [commotion continues] Pothuraju, they took my coconut! They are thrashing your friends. They are talking bad about Puri Jagannadh. The one who said that the movie is a flop... I want to hear that from him, again. I said so. So what? I said so. So what? It's me, right? -That's me. So what? -[all]: Yeah, that's him. He's on fire! Hand me that... PURI What's with this movie, the black tickets, and this fight... To know all this from the start... I have to start from the age where I was... ...wondering about unwanted hair at unwanted places. I mean to say beard and mustache! [bell rings] [man screams in pain] POKIRI [bell ring continues] Move move... Fast! It's a super hit! 'Once I commit to something, I'll listen to none' Saying this is so easy for anyone. 'I won't listen to myself...' Only Puri Jagannadh can say that. I just liked Puri Jagannadh until this point. After Pokiri, it turned into madness! I went so mad that... I'm 18 years old right here. That's 10 years ago. I wanted to pen down these ten years of my life into a cinema story. And I have to make my favorite director Puri Jagannadh direct it. No matter if I'm living or dead... My life story should live on in his direction. This is the decision I took. BOMMA BLOCK BUSTER For some clarity, I'll give you a glimpse of these 18 years. My dad... He knew nothing but to fish. He never forced me to follow him. He suggested me to follow my heart. Being a movie buff came down from my father himself. He used to take me to the movies whenever he found free time. I told him that I saw Pokiri and I wanted to write my life story as a movie. My dad looked at me with emotion in his eyes and aksed me to follow my heart. I don't know why he looked at me like that. Let's see if he tells why. Those visuals are not that great, so I'm avoiding them. And my little sister... We always keep fighting. I have no idea if she likes me or not! But let me show you her character through a scene. Shruthi, where is the dirty cloth? -God! Oh my God! -What's with the hurry? Give me your hand. -Dad, it's hurting. -Can't you see the water boiling. How many times should I tell you? Look what happened! -Dad? -Ha? -Dad... -What? Go on. See... I'm writing a story, right? How will it reach Puri sir? It will. I'll take it to him. -How can that be? -Dad, tell him something. Or else, he won't let you go. You too support him now! Let's go to Anakapalle first. Let's catch a passenger train and get off in Hyderbad by the next morning. Let's take an auto there. Let's give him 500 bucks and ask him to show us all the movie stars' houses. -Come here. -Huh? Why will he show us all that? Fool! Do you know Appi, Veera's son? He gave the auto driver 500 bucks and saw all their houses. What? We'll do the same. He'll say, 'This is Chiranjeevi's house. Bala Krishna's house. Nagarjuna's house'. 'This is Rajamouli's house'. 'This is Puri Jagannadh's house', there we jump off and hand him the script. That's it! What? Great people have watchmen at the gates. Will they let us go? They will thrash us both. Hey... Don't think about all that. Listen... I'm ready to get thrashed for you. While they thrash me, you get in and hand him the script. Ok? I liked him! I liked my dad even more after that. I opened the scene for my sister, but my dad became highlighted, right? My most favorite person telling me that he'll take me to my favorite person. I liked it a lot! And I got fixed! My dad will take me to Puri Jagannadh. This is fixed! I told you everything that happened in these 18 years. Everything that happens from now on should be cinematic! Cinematic...! Cinematic...! Cinematic...! Of course, nothing happens cinematically... We have to create everything. If something has to happen, it should happen in these ten years. I thrashed many in the name of 'being cinematic'. I got into fights. I started fights. I poked into others' fights too. And sometimes me too... -Dad? -Hmm... -Hey! -What? I'll show you a great scene inside the station. Let's go. What will you show me in the police station, you fool! Dad! -Come on... -Hey, stop! -I beg you. -Nothing will happen. -This is a police station. -Don't panic! -What's with that commotion? -Shh! -Send her away. -Please, no. -What do you want? -Namasthe, madam. Tell me. What's the matter? You... You'll have this list, right? Speak properly. I don't get you. The list of the... Someone from the list... -What! Remove those shades first! -Ok, madam. Ok! Hey, no! Madam, those files you have... The files... The files with the names of the bad guys and their photos. If you can hand me that file, I'll go get them all. That's it! What, uncle... What's this? -Hey, let's go. -What's happening? I can do anything, madam. Ask anyone you want... They'll tell you about me. Hey! You... That's my son! This is what I can do, madam. If you can hand me a list of scoundrels like him... I'll catch one after another and will throw them at your feet. And you can pay me with... I mean, whatever you see fit. What, dad? That's it! Nice! Very nice! Constables, throw him in the cell. That is the first scene where I get to know that there... ...is a lot of difference between cinema and reality. In movies, the one in front you won't hit you back. That's not how it is in reality. Before we land a hit, four others will take fourty hits at us. We'll just die! That's why, whatever we do, we have to think it through. Or else, this is how it will be... Damaging! That's how ten years went by and I become a man. -Oh God! -Now he cries about pains in his body... Does it look like a house at all! Specially your room. Next time you go out, I'll tear all the posters. Hey... With you having no sense of duty, who do you think will get me married? Who else? I'm here to take care of that, right? Not just some normal groom... I'll bring you a prince. If not, stop calling me by my name. Enough with your empty words. Drop me at the college. -Fast! I'm getting late. -Ok ok... Hey... See if the bell is working. Of course, it works. Here. [bell rings] Get off. I need to go. I can't handle my following around here. Don't think too much about yourself. -Hi. -Hi. [bells ringing] Today's topic is Demand and... -Tanmai sir... -Supply... Sir! Your line is turning into a curve, sir! Ok. Did your brother see you see me? On the cycle yesterday? No, he didn't. Why don't you come talk to him once? No no, I'm scared. But let the time decide. Don't get too scared. You tell your parents and I'll tell my brother. All the idiots are here. What's the status of our script? It's a huge script, right? It takes time. Hey, what problem? I'll ask my dad to clear it. Nothing. It's about some loan. We took our Prasad Roa and he even paid us seeing him. Prasad Rao took that money, saying that he'll pay it back. But he didn't. We went to his home to ask and his wife... She's shouting on us. So I asked my mom and dad to create a scene. I'm really tensed. -Why to involve your dad? -Hey... -Where is the fight happening? -Dude... I beg you. Don't mess it up. Please. -What's wrong with him? -Please don't mess it up. [news playing] Move move... Give way. Vanajakshi... move it! Move! God... What's with these money issues! They keep coming onto our house early in the morning. They won't even let us eat. How can you cheat us and call yourself a mediator! -We want our money back. -Do we look like cheaters to you? -Stop talking too much! -Raju, my parents will take care of it. Stop it... Let me talk and help you out. We want our money back. It's not salty enough. Not properly roasted too. God, look at him... He eats dosa all day with all kinds of chutneys. After preparing all that, he says it was not roasted properly. Whom should I deal with? You or him? Why do we care about your dosa issues? -Give our money back... -Aunty, you wait. Let me talk to them. Uncle... Uncle... Who's your uncle here? As if you are my sister's son, or my brother-in-law's! Who knows? Maybe I will become one. Stop! When will you give our money back? -Stop! -How many days will you make us wait? Stop it! Don't disturb a nice scene that's in motion. Hey... Give their money back. As if your dad's money is in there. So that I'll listen to you at once. -Do whatever... Just pay us back. -Dude, stop! -Let me talk. -Do you want another dosa? Not now. -So you are not paying us back! -No! What will you do? -You get him another dosa. -Do you want another dosa? I'm talking to him, right? Hey! Please don't. -Go get 5 ltrs kerosene. -Okay. Gosh! Pothu Raju is pouring kerosene on himself. Hey! What is this man? [commotion continues] Shall I blow it off... Or shall I blow off? Oh, God! No... Here, son. Prasad Rao finally paid! Pothuraju is not that easy... -Is it? -Of course! "Oh my, brother-in-law..." "I went to work at his pond..." "I went to work at his pond..." "He saw my beauty and all my curves..." "Only then he saw my face and started swirling his mustache..." "This is a river that has many ups and downs..." "Oh, little bird... don't dare to act smart around these skies." "Oh, little bird..." "Look at them... they are really smart and sharp..." "A group that will steal you in total is following up!" "Following up!" "Oh, little bird..." "Take a clear look..." "A man who's as fast as an express." "One should learn how to pose from you." "A man who's as fast as an express." "There's absolutely no one who can define you." [traditional romantic chants] Your brother is watching us! I'm here to get you married. I have a class now, brother-in-law. -Let's meet in the evening. -Go. Do you wanna get married normally, or are you planning to elope? No no. My parents will agree for this. -Without my heroism showing off? -Yes! -So there's nothing I can do? -Yeah. "I have penned down everything that happened to me, as it is." "Of course, I made it look a little cinematic." "Add two threes and give you one six." "Say that you won't let me add and there breaks a fight." "Keep working harder every single day..." "Let's show them how it's done." "A man who's as fast as an express." -Pothuraju... -Coming... What's so urgent? -To go meet the master's parents... -Keep it low... It seems like you have already talked to him. All set? He says that his parents will agree. It's a happy news, right? What happy? Where will I get a scene from all this! There's nothing I can write if they agree on everything. Then what are you going to do? I have to do something, but... Do you know where he lives? Of course, if we take a right from Suri's house... Hey! Stop it. -Do you know where it is? -Of course, I do. -Let's go. -Ok. "One should learn how to pose from you." "There's absolutely no one who can define you." Haven't your prepared coconut chutney? Enough with your coconut chutney! Can't you eat without it? Stop thinking about dosa all the time and listen to your son. -Go on... -There's a girl in my college... You fool! Fit for nothing. As if only his sister is left for you to fall in love with! Do you know what that Pothuraju did this afternoon? He did? Why did you come here again? Your son, the master... He's in love with my sister. I will not agree to this marriage, no matter what. Get lost you fool! What are you even thinking? Why will I agree to this marriage in the first place? A rowdy like you is her brother! -Is it an 'Yes' or a 'No'? -No! That's it! That's what I want. That's it! That's what I want. I'll see how you'll stop them from getting married. If it comes to that, I'll break his legs and will take him away. -Do you understand? -Hey! -What? -While you break legs and take him away... -What? -I'm not a fool to just keep watching. You are not a fool, but you'll be busy eating dosa. I'll get them married in the time you eat your dosa... Or else, stop calling me by my name. Keep watching, your son will marry my sister. And I'll rule you then! -He said he'll take me away! -Yeah! Idiot! Listen... With him making a scene inside our house... Do we have to stay silent like impotent men? You and your bloody love! Bloody fool... Get lost! [door knocking Brother-in-law... Master! Brother-in-law! -Why do you look angry? -I know what you did this afternoon. Will you take me away? He came home this afternoon and made a scene here. He said he'll get us married by kidnapping me. He said he'll break my legs. I thought it will become a great scene in my movie... Stop saying movie stories. Of course, I will say that! How can I let go of a superb scene like this? God, you messed up everything in the name of your movie. Now we can't get married. Damn you guys! Stop crying. This has to be done. If they agree to the marriage and even arrange it... Should I be eating dosa and watch you be happy with your kids? I'm doing all this for the cinematic effect! You said the same thing this morning. Don't you feel any shame? Hey, stop blaming me and listen to my plan. Master, I'm telling you. Be ready by tomorrow morning. I'm helping you elope. Got it? -Say 'Yes'. -Yes. -I'm coming. -Make it fast. -Give me your hand. We are getting late. -Just jump! Let me wear the shirt! Bye-bye! Everyone is looking at us. Drive fast! Master, are you scared or what? Everything is going smoothly. Don't worry. Why elope when my parents would agree? Too much! What will I be left with to write in my scenes if we don't elope? Usually, girls elope... Look at the boy elope! Whatever, the food tastes really great. I want my mom and dad. Or else, I won't get married. -Why are you saying that? -I want my parents. -Took such risk to get you married... -Please bro-in-law... -look at that girl, just come. -Please. Both of you sit in your designated places. No need to sit, there is no time at all, make it quick. -Bring the garland. Where have you been? -Coming man. -Quick. -What are you doing here? Look for the photographer. Make it fast, we are running out of time. -Here... -Give me. -Make him tie it. -Lower your head. Fool! -It's you who have to tie it. -Right, go on. Make it fast. - [all] Go on. Do it... -Brother-in-law... -Shall I? -Stop eating my brains. -Go on. See how happy she is. -Tie it fast. -That's it... Claps! -[celebrations] [indistinct chatter] Don't you want my blessings? [indistinct chatter] -Click a nice photograph. -We should show it to his parents. Smile, brother-in-law. Click it. Listen... You have to take care of your sister. Why will I be angry with her. I'm the one who has to get her married, right? How dare you, Pothuraju! When I'm not in town... You cheated my son and got him married to your sister? Of course, my son is a fool. God! Take me and your mom along with you. She'll cook for you both and will do the dishes. Great! Damn you! -Hey, look at me roam like a cat... -Chair. No one is respecting me and is asking me to sit. -Please sit, uncle. -That's it. Hey, your marriage seems to be causing my death. Your mom is scolding me like hell. I feel like it's better to die than listening to them. Such bad scoldings! God! Oh my God! That's ok. How much dowry are you bringing? -My brother will answer that. -Brother? Where is he? -He went to see a movie. -Hmm, that's your brother! Watching movie without paying dowry. What can he even give? He will give me a maximum of four tickets for a movie. There's no way he's paying me dowry. -Do you know how to make dosa? -Yeah. Do something. A gas stove. Two gas cylinders. And also get two tins of oil... And come home. We can make dosa. What about the batter, uncle? Only your aunty can prepare better batter. NAGARAJU DRAMA COMPANY. ANAKAPALLI. Is this Irupula street youth leader speaking? This is Nagaraju speaking. Drama broker. Tell me. Why didn't you give me the contract for the carnival, sir? I gave it to someone else. Why didn't you call me? I have lost the book with all the phone numbers in it, sir. At least give us the Goripalayam carnival contract. Talk to the president. Even his number is in the same book. -I have been searching for it.-Shall I send it? It's ok, I asked Dolak Raju. He said he'll send with his son. [dialing tone] President sir, this is Drama broker Nagaraju. About the drama contract-- The festival is in the next three days and you call me now? Fool! Don't ever call me again. Get lost. Why did you call me? I asked you not to call me for a while, right? My phone numbers book is missing. Maybe I lost it there that day. You might have kept it somewhere and forgot, drunkard! Don't ever call me again... Or show your bloody face to me. OK... okay. I lost all my contracts here. I'll meet you in for next festival. God! Durga... Sir... I just saw 'Iddarammayilatho' (With two girls) movie on TV. And I felt like I need at least one girl in my life... While we were fighting over something silly... [indistinct music playing on radio] Hey, the one you hit yesterday bought Pothuraju with him. Don't get excited. Excitement gives you fear. Good one. What? Why did you come in groups? -This is a barbershop, right? -Yeah. We are here to get massaged... Move aside! -Move! -What style do you want? Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, or Balayya? Tell me. You can apply the oil later... Massage me first. What, brother? Because we are from the other village... You are hitting me in the name of massage! This is how we massage. How dare you hit me in the name of massage! [church bells ringing] You... Wow! Where are you going? Stop! Hey... Hey! No! -Hey... -Stop! -Look... -Hit him! Do we need this? Let's go. Thrash them! Hit them! -Hey! -What's your name? What are you looking at? I mean... I love to watch fights. You like watching fights! Why don't we fall in love? We can talk about that later... Did you see 'Mosagaallu' (Cheaters) movie? -I did. -Who's the villain in that movie? Chiranjeevi. -Chiranjeevi. -Chiranjeevi! Did you see 'Andarivaadu' (Man of masses) movie? -I did. -Who's the hero in that movie? Chiranjeevi. Chiranjeevi... See, the matter is that... they are fighting over there, right? I'm going to thrash them. Even if they hit me or I hit them... I will always be the Chiranjeevi in this equation. -Ok? -Wow! Just for your clarity. You keep watching. Let's go. Tell me this... You said you like watching fights, right? Come, take a close look. -Hey, how can you take her like that? -Come on... Come come come... Look at you guys trying to act smart! Not here... -Where is he taking her? -That's it. This is the spot... If you watch from here... You'll have a clear look. Stop! Go get shaved completely. Get lost! God! He hit me again! -We have to beat him to a pulp! -Hey... -What are you doing? -To add some rain effect. What's with your obsession! Hey... Let's get married! Marriage? There are so many things to do before that. So you are okay to get married after all that? Will you show me a fight everyday? -Fight? -Trash him, instead of getting trashed. -Not just one... I'll show you a hundred! -Ouch! "Come with me, girl..." "Look at my eyes calling for you..." "Look at all the weight..." "...that my heart is lifting these days." "It lit up a spark..." "The minute you touched me..." "Look at the romantic bargain..." "That my youth is playing with you." "Come with me, girl..." "Into the streets... Into the fights..." "Let's make a scene every single day..." "Come with me, girl..." "Into the streets... Into the fights..." "Let's make a scene every single day..." "Did a rain drop come this way..." "Then a new plant of love will take life." "With one touch of her lips..." "That tree starts growing." "In the air around us that's mixing together..." "It's being really tough to take all this high that's being created." "With the bait of a stare..." "I get even more high." "Come with me, girl..." "Into the streets... Into the fights..." "Let's make a scene every single day..." "Who knows when it landed..." "The little bird that's always in flight." "It started getting twisted..." "This crazy little string inside my heart." "I looked at you in anger of romance..." "When the sweat over your forehead rubbed on my chest." "I started breathing fast..." "What's with this great high!" "Come with me, girl..." "Into the streets... Into the fights..." "Let's make a scene every single day..." "Let's make a scene every single day..." Hey, how can you jump in and catch fish so easily? -What if someone sees? -No worries. This time, Raju tender underwater net putting. -Fish coming. We catching. -What! You mean to say you got this place legally approved? So that you can do fishing here for the whole season? By placing a trap under the water... Am I right? My sister... Crazy with English. I only understood 'Water'! That's why I tell you not to talk in English with girls. Hey, stop it! That's ok... Did anyone every flirt with you? -Means? -I know you know what it means. I mean... Did any guy... Get to you... Of course, there is a long list... -But I have to tell you about one guy. -Who's that! Hey... Such a superb dance! Are you a cabaret dancer? -Answer me... -Hey, Vani. -Someone is calling you. -Coming... I just joined today. Let's meet tomorrow. Tata. Bye! What? Prasad removed his shades? I'm working here for one year. I never saw him without shades. Never! I'm Prasad Babu's voice over. You usually hear voice over. But here, you see it visually. His name is Prasad Babu. He's a little strange. See for yourself. Red and yellow clothes. He's too rich. More than 10 crores. Once a man told him that the money he has is actually his parents'. He asked him what he did to deserve that. So to earn his own money, he joined his uncle's company for 10k salary. And he aimed to earn more than 10 crores. He work really hard for that. Let's see more strange things like this. Wow! What a characterisation! What a build-up! So many variations! A man like him should be in our circles, not elsewhere. Where is he now? There he is. I like you. You like me. Let's fall in love. I like you both... Turn... Your pants, your shirt, your shades... Chubby! They say you don't remove the shades at all. Let me tell you two things. She's mine. I'll never give her to you. Get fixed to that first. The matter is that... There are a lot of great things and characterizations hiding inside you. Look at me... You have everything, right? This is not where you have to be... You have to be there. Understood? -Vani... -Forget about her. Be with me and I'll keep you there. -Will you put me there? -That's what I'm saying. You look so great like a Salmon fish! Dad! Dad, what happened? Dad, what happened? [commotion of thoughts] Raju! Are you thinking that my life is going really smooth? But every minute of my happiness is temporary. Even if I'm surrounded with a crowd around me... Lonliness is always haunting me. And I started searching for that. In that process there are lot of things that haunt me and also things I hunt. Raju, the one we thrashed has nothing to do with this. There is a guy in Vizag. One from the contacts book. If we can get to him, we'll know who the book belongs to. His name is Gautham. Hey, we'll get that Gautham at the old fish market. What will you get from hitting me? The one you are searching for is Nagaraju. We used to work as drama brokers for carnivals. I used to help him in the matter of actresses. Also, he's not staying here since few months. I came to know that he moved to Orissa. You have to wait until Ankalamma carnival to get to him. Pothuraju, you need patience to make a hunt. Every fish will fall into the net. Just have some patience. I told you that they are performing a drama on the Annual day, right? They are rehearsing for that now. Hey, what happened? -My friend. -What happened? Why are you crying? Wow! Wonderful! Such a wonderful beauty! Don't know how much difficulty God had gone through to make this wonder! Look at her curves, it's evident, my friend! I couldn't stay away from her anymore. Please take me into your arms. Hug me close to your heart. Hug me... He's taking her muteness as an advantage. We have to do something. Listen... You acted really well. But I have to tell you something. -Can I? -Go on. -Maybe he'll get angry. -It's ok, he won't. Go on. Rather than this getup in this play... Do you see the Brihannala getup? That will suit you better. Brihannala? Will it be good? True. You'll be the main focus in the play then. You'll get highlighted. Hey... Get me the Brihannala getup. Let's make this beauty happy. [celebrations] Don't worry, dear. He is going to pay for his sins. You go to Bheemasena and tell him everything. Wow! Such a great actor he is. He's not acting... He's living it. He's really a half and half. -Is it? -Hmm. [celebrations] Don't take tension. I'll take care of him. How dare you call me a half and half! By the time the drama ends, you shouldn't be seen in the college. If you do, the entire college will talk about how big a man I am. You shouldn't be seen around here! -Bloody! -Sister... Sister? There comes a day in our life, when we think of breaking the mental meter. If someone pokes us exactly at that time... The meter will just blow off! Deva Danava Yaksha Gandharva Kinnera Kimpurusha... (races of mystical beings) Human and sages... In a way, none of them can... You prayed for me... As if to announce your love and respect towards me. You made me... ...really happy by showing how special you are, Ravana! Brother, just a minute. I'll be back. Hey, what's with the bleeding? A small fight at the college. A guy thrashed me to pulp just because I touched his girl. Fool! Brother is still angry with what you did last time. -And now this! -Hey! Why are you blabbering without asking about who did this to me? If I ever find him... Stop it. I'm talking, right? If you bring filth like this onto the house... Forget about him. I'll kill you! Bloody idiot! Hey, you leave. I'll talk to him. He has got one for him, right? Ask him to go with her instead. Jakkanna sir... Been so long. It won't happen again. I'll send my boys... -And will get it done. Ok? -Sir, our boys are here. They are my son's friends. -Call them. -Come on. Dad, my friends. Puri Jagannadh. Birthday party. Celebration. Shut up! Talk in Telugu. Even the stars talk to me in Telugu. Our Puri sir's birthday is coming... Director Puri Jagannadh. We want to celebrate it like we did last year. Cutting the cake or my pocket! Nothing like that. -What's with him? -It's too hot. -That's... -Hey! Wanna go home? He's our guy. -About the money. -I almost forgot. -Nari, come here. -Tell me, sir. Make sure my pictures are huge this time. [all] For sure, sir. Damn this phone. -Who's that, sir? -Sunny Leone. Fishes, fishes! Big fishes! This market sells the load that we bring in from the ocean. Let's buy from here? -Come on! Fresh fish... Fresh fish... -There? -Fresh shrimp and crab! -Not there... There... Let's buy from Rangamma aunty. -How much is this? -300. -Rangamma aunty! -Raju, how are you? -I'm good. Show me some fish. -Take whatever you like. How much is this? This... -This one? Take it. -For free? No no. I have to pay you. This is business. -Hey, it's you, right? It's ok... -No no! Hey bring out the Pulasa fish from the icebox. Fresh fish! Fresh fish! What kind of fish is this, brother? -What kind of fish is this? -Pulasa. Give me a fish, brother. Do you think this is a free shelter? Get lost! Please don't say that, brother. My mom loves this fish. I'll work for you for this whole day, brother. I'll do whatever you say, brother. I'll give you the fish... Will you bring me your mother? Please don't talk like that, brother! Go. Get lost! Everyone wants a free fish! -He wants the Pulasa for free! -Show us a better one... -Raju, let's buy those small fish. -What? -There? -She's not talking money, no? Ok, aunty. I'll come again. Stop dragging me around! Welcome, madam. What do you want? How much is this fish? This is 200. That's 1,420. -What fish is that? -This? Pulasa! -Will it tastes good? -Of course, it will. What? Will it taste better than you? Yeah! Take this and cook it well. I'll come tonight. Here is the man who will kill you! What? What's this? What happened? He said he'll come visit me tonight. Come tonight... I'll be there too. Let's cook together. Scoundrel! Let's go. Hey, someone hit me and is getting away. Come on! Let's get him. Do you know what really happened? Tastes better than you? Which man will keep calm after that? [all]: He's the man! Our guy is a better man! [all]: Yes, he is. You made a fool out of me even this year. Where is my photo? Dad, big photo. Back came. Big photo! -Call him. -Raju... [celebrations] -[celebrations continues] -First you should have it. Come on! My money is gone. And the cake too. Suri, get a chair to president sir. He'll talk to us before the food is ready. Hey, who the hell is he? He's Prasad Babu, our well-wisher. Prasad Babu... Hey, I don't want to waste my time for him. Who's that doll? We can talk about her later. -What's her name? -Vani. Vani. Daddy, that girl Rani. God, what's with him! You are not supposed to be here. You have to be in the movies. I have few contacts with me. Shall I use my influence? Which celebrities do you know? I know everyone. See... I know Puri Jagannadh... Also V.V. Vinayak. That's ok... Do you know Balayya Babu? Of course... I have his personal number too. When he comes here, I take care of everything for him. Why don't you call him once and ask him for a wish? Raju... Hello! Is this Balayya Babu sir? -Ah, namasthe, sir.-Namasthe! What are you doing, sir? Who the hell are you? Sir, forgive me, sir. I'm one of your fans, sir. Start with that. 'What are you doing'... Bloody donkey! You have to introduce yourself first. Bloody fool! He seems to be angry right now. Don't you have any sense? How can you ask me to call him at this late hour? I just called him out of excitment. Why to blame you! I have to blame myself. I can't handle this disrespect. -I'll kill myself. -Sister, no! Vani... Hey, of course, I'm the President... But I don't have money to pay for all this. -Please! -No no, I'll take care of that. Vani... "Deep down inside..." "I've got a feeling" "Deep down inside..." [humming] [humming classical vocals] "The sweet moment we meet..." "My heart is boiling in this hot romance" "I started breathing fast..." "What's this strange high?" "What's this strange high?" "What's this strange high?" Raju... Mr. Pothuraju! Raju... Mr. Pothuraju! What is he doing here? Hey, where is he? Where is Pothuraju? Behind the hut. Mr. Pothuraju! Come here and I'll tell you something. I won't come there and you don't come here. Just tell me. Only if you come here. Hey... Tell me. Only here. -Your guy is writing a story, right? -Yeah. Why do you ask? Puri Jagannadh is coming. Is it? -When? -On 28th this month. -Where to? -Atchutapuram, baby! -Puri Jagannadh is coming! -Yeah! To our Atchutapuram? The village carnival is about to start and Puri Jagannadh is going to visit... I felt so happy! My story is almost done. Just the climax is remaining. To know what it is about... You have to learn about my life that I have lost about 12 months ago. -Dad, have some water. -Give me. Dad, 'Paisa Vasool' movie... It's a blockbuster! The theaters are shaking. Dad, give me some money. -I don't have any money on me. -What! Bye! Hey... -Paisa Vasool (Money shot)! -Such a great son! [thunders rumbling in distance] Is that blood? Yeah, he's limping. Might have gotten into something. How did it happen? It's nothing, dad. Don't listen to her. You always say that. Let me see. A glass piece might have kissed my feet. -Get some first aid. -Dad, eat first. -I know you'll ask me that! -No need to catch my feet while eating? -Nothing happened! -It's quite common in this house... Isn't it? Here is some turmeric. Why don't you stay at home? Always roaming on the roads like a goon! Dad... She said 'Goon' (Pokiri). My boss's movie! What's the status of your story? -You should be careful, right? -It's ok! -It'll be ok. Apply here too. -Yeah... What's with you, dad? You are spoiling him. Always asking about his story... I don't understand your madness. Madness? I have to tell you something. My dad's dad... Your great grandfather. He's a great artist. He have got lot of awards too. My dad... Your grandfather... Even he's an artist. He thought of teaching me his skill. Even I wanted to learn. But I got married really early. That's it... You both were born. And your mom left us for the heavens. One day, he came to me and said... 'Dad, I'll write a story and will make a movie'. I saw my father in him that day. What else a father wants other than finding his father in his son? That's why I said 'Yes'. I encouraged him to write, saying that I'm behind him to support. Forget all that... You said you'll take me to Puri Jagannadh, right? When? Don't think that you can escape it, saying that you got old and all. I know nothing and no one there. I'll take you. What if I get old? I'll take you before I die, ok? -You first write a good story! -Stop talking about death now! You eat. Save my plate, I'll eat later. Wait... It's hot. Eat some. -Not now, dad. -Listen to me. The fish is really tender. Eat some. Hey, don't go playing with your leg still healing. My son love this fish. You keep cooking and he'll keep fighting! What? What did you say? I saw him fighting in front of our house. Watch your step first. Stop blabbering all the time! I'm not blaming your son! Why will you keep blaming my son for every fight that happens in the village? Hey, Suri! That's it. Game ball! Hey, Pothuraju! Pothuraju! Hey... Someone is trying to kill your dad in the fields outside the village. Dad! Dad... Uncle... Raju! What happened! Dad! Dad, what happened? Dad, what happened? Dad, what happened? What? Dad, who did this? Dad, tell me! -Dad! Dad... -Brother... Dad, who did this to you? Tell me. Tell me... Dad, who did this to you. Dad, you'll be ok. Dad... Hey, pick him up.. -Come on! -Careful! Dad, you'll be ok. [indistinct chatter] You said you'll take me to Puri Jagannadh, right? When? Don't think that you can escape it, saying that you got old and all. I know nothing and no one there. I'll take you. What if I get old? I'll take you before I die, ok? "Are you really gone?" "Tell me this is just a dream." "If someone tells me that all this is true..." "I would really don't want to believe so..." "Are you really gone?" "Tell me this is just a dream." "If someone asks me where my shadow disappeared to..." "What should I answer them about where my dad is!" "Dad... Dear, dad..." "Are you coming back? Or shall I come to you?" "Dad... Dear, dad..." "Are you coming back? Or shall I come to you?" "Dad... Dear, dad..." "Are you coming back? Or shall I come to you?" "Dad... Dear, dad..." "Are you coming back? Or shall I come to you?" "Your eyes that hardly slept..." "They still saw all my dreams." "Though the wounds are to my feet..." "The pain was always to your heart." "Everything I do..." "Why do you keep supporting me and nothing else?" "Of course, the happiness is mine..." "But all the sacrifices behind it are yours." "How could you leave me?" "How can you be so stone hearted?" "Dad... Dear, dad..." "Aren't you still there inside me?" "There's no way that there will be another father like you!" "The eyes that tear up..." "I'll rub them off with my palms..." "And I will start fighting again..." "I will take a step forward." "To your son's heart..." "And to the dreams that you have filled in them..." "I will show them what victory looks like..." "I swear on you..." "I'll give you all my wins..." "Never say 'No'." "Dad... Dear, dad..." "In the story I write..." "You are the hero, dad..." "No matter who says what!" "Dad..." "Dear, dad..." "Dad..." "Dad... Dear, dad..." "Dad... Dear, dad..." "Are you coming back? Or shall I come to you?" "Shall I come to you?" For a man who's breathing in peace, sitting at the edge of a mountain... All of a sudden, his own breathe became a burden for him. I lost my one and only strength. My hope, my strength... My dad is my everything. I failed to take in the fact that my dad is no more. And I didn't understand why someone killed my dad so brutally! The only clue I found is the book with the phone numbers in it. I searched every drama company with the numbers from that book as leads. And I ended up at a name - Nagaraju. One small push and everything breaks loose. This Nagaraju is our one little push. He works as a broker for drama companies. He is the only link between me and my dad's killer. No matter how much you thrash me... I don't know anything! Hey... Hang him upside down! We are returning from a drama that day... [singing a traditional song] Malli, sing our song. [singing a vulgar song] Hey, idiot! Sing properly. Sing as brother says. Such a bad timing! -Nagaraju, change the tyre. -Brother, change it fast. -Ok ok. -We have to buy a new van soon. -Hey, come on. -You keep making me do all the work. -Make it fast. -Let me get the jockey. Leave me! -You bloody! -I beg you... Shut up! Bloody moron! How many times should I tell you? Brother! You dog! How many times should we tell you this? Hey, don't make a scene. Come on. -Move! -Come... Hey, who are you? What are you doing here? I have never seen you around! Nothing, uncle... We came to see the carnival. We stay here in Vepagunta. We are a drama company, uncle. We are here to get some shade as the women asked for. We are getting late. Ok, we'll take leave, uncle. Come on. Uncle, he's lying. Of course, we are a drama company. But he raped me. Hey, girl... Keep quiet! Uncle, she's just joking! Shut up! Let her talk. -I said, let her talk. -Listen to me, uncle... Tell me... Who are you? Where are you from? Who are all these people? Why are you here with them? They keep doing this to us... Please get us justice! Is this true? I'm asking you guys... Don't worry. I'm here for you. I'll call the villagers. I won't let them get away with this. I am there for you, don't worry. -Shut up! I'm not going to let this go. -Uncle, listen to us. Please! Bullabbai, what are you doing? Let go of her! -Hey! -Ow! Hey! What the hell did you do? I felt like using her and I did. Poke me again and I won't even spare you. Understood? Move! What will he do to help you, huh? How dare you complain on me? Call the villagers! Call! Raju! And you thought he will save you. Raju! What justice will you bring to her? Don't go into the village. You'll get caught. -Raju! -Who will come to save you? Do you want to serve her the justice? -Brother, someone saw us. -Uncle! -Kill him and get back. -Get back, we'll get caught! -Pothuraju! -Hey, Nagaraju... He saw us. Go kill him. -Let's go. -Move move! Do you want justice? Get up... Who the hell are you? Leave me. Let go of me. You... Pothuraju... -Pothuraju! -Bullabbai, he escaped. Let's leave! Will you die and sleep with him. Or live to sleep with me? Choose one! Tell me... I'll sleep with you as you wish... Raju! Raju! [chatter] [announcer on speaker box] For all the disciples who are here for the Muthyalamma carnival... This is our grand welcome. From today onwards, there will be dramas, special worships... What, sir? What brings you to our house? Our guys wanted to participate in the drama. Hey, come here. -Will you deal with it, or shall I? -No no, he will. -Be careful! -I'll deal with it. I'll take care! Let me go talk to the girls then. Wow! Such a soft skin! What, girl? Do you also act? I'm a huge fan of Puri Jagannadh. I love his Pokiri movie. We'll pick three highlight scenes. Brother, we never did this, right? Sir, help us out here. -Let me. -You said the payment is 1 lakh. And you paid us only 70k. Now, what's with these cinema dialogues? Hey, pay him the remaining 30k and get it done. -Yeah, let's do it. -Yeah. Brother, this won't work out. Think of it once. Seems odd! No no, we won't let you feel that way. Right, President sir? We swear on him. We'll stick to the mythological language. Ok. Where will we rehearse it then? We won't play without rehearsal. [commotion occurs] We have our community hall for that, right? -Such a great idea! -Clap for him then. -Thank you... Thank you! -So... We are rehearsing the Pokiri movie in mythological language tomorrow. Ok. Why do you keep encouraging him all the time? Always asking about his story... I don't understand your madness. I have to tell you something. Your great grandfather. He's a great artist. Even grandfather is an artist. Even I wanted to learn. One day he told me that he'll write a story and make a movie. I saw my father in him. So I said 'Yes'. So I encouraged him, saying that I'll always be by his side. Suri, you guys stop here. Don't get involved into my mess. Raju... We spend 20 hours a day with you. How can you ask us to stop? Dude, whenever I talk to my mom about you... I keep saying, 'Our Pothuraju... Our friend'. But how come you changed that 'Our' to 'You'? Don't seperate us. We'll be with you all along. Raju. I'm also with you. Ok, listen to the plan. They come here for the rehearsals, two days before the festival. I don't know how we'll win this... But we have to take advantage of the situations and break a fight. We have to chase them through the banana plantations from there... Make them cross the Toofan building and into the fields next to the road... And close all this off right where it all started. A 6 feet long hole in the ground. 3 feet deep mud. 3 feet deep filth. 12 feet long rope. We have to make him run. Throw them into the hole as per the plan. Our climax should rock as we kill one after another. [chatter] [practicing dialogue] Hey, it's getting late. Let's start. Start with your dialogue. Hey, even we have to hire someone like her in our play. -She saw us! -She did! -My King... -Stop! Let me see this Panduraju for a while... What's this? You went on to hit him with the mace I bought you. And now you are here with him to hit me! Damn it! Give me few more gold coins... I will kill him too. Oh, you? Hey... I like you! What? This scene is non-existing. Enough with your dialogues. -Tell me... Is this dialogue really there? -Hey, stop it. It's ok. Let's not poke into each other's plays. This is the first scene. Let's start with the second. Give us this heavy king... He says he doesn't know who Ali Bhai Fakir is. What? Just because you played a king in two plays... Do you feel like you are really a king? 'He thinks'. -What's with all the mistakes? -God, leave me alone! I saw Pokiri movie last night itself. None of these characters are in the scene. -Brother! -How can you say that I'm wrong? Because you are wrong. Do as he says. -Start. -Start off... So you really don't know who Ali Bhai Fakir is? Not just him. Even I don't know who Ali Bhai Fakir is! Damn it! Brother... What's with this bloody pointless meeting? -There are 8 to 10 people... -10! Yeah, 10... If we kill them all... We can go home, right? Hey, have you gone mad? I'm clear on it... Are you? Say 'Yes'... And they are finished. [all]: What the hell are you talking about? -What are you talking about! -You think you can kill me? Catch this. Come on... Kill me! Kill me... Look at me, you! Will you? Look at me... Kill me if you can. Go on! -He's stepping on my feet! -Look at me... Kill me if you can! -Brother, say 'Yes'. I'm confident. -Look at me... Kill me if you can! -He's stepping on my feet! -You are newbie and do you want to kill? Hey, you are stepping on her feet. Move! -It seems he will kill me... -Brother! Look at me... Will you kill me? -Will you? -You will never say 'Yes'! I told you not to step on her feet! Why did you hit him for real? You bastards! Vani, you leave. Hey! Hey... Make them cross the Toofan building. Come on, guys. Hey... Make them cross the Toofan building. Trap those bastards in the net. -Hey! -Hey, Pothuraju! -You... Stop! -Stop, stop you bastard! -Brother! Brother! -Brother! Brother! Hey! Hey, place that liquor in the bag and hang it to the cycle. I'll be there. Dad... I've completed my story, dad. My boss is here. Our next village... He's shooting in Atchutapuram. I'm going to hand him my story, dad. All my friends are here... To take me there. But you are missing, dad! But you are there in our cinema, dad. You are the hero. This is not my story, dad. This is your story. [tires screeching] [voice muted] [chants] THIS IS MY STORY - DIRECTED BY PURI JAGANNADH [voice muted] Raju... Mr. Pothuraju. -PURI JAGANNADH. -THIS IS MY STORY. [indistinct voice] -Really? -Congrats! Puri sir? He took my story? One more little difference between cinema and life. We can't know someone's entire story in just a 3 hours movie. Cinema is what happens in the scenes. Life is what happens between the scenes. His death, my vengeance, and my goal are the highlight scenes. Between these scenes, the dosa I ate at my sister's house. The touch phone my darling bought me. The cake my friends brought on my birthday. The ocean near my village. The fish curry for lunch. My villagers and their meaningless discussions. A 3 hour movie can't contain all that. We can't add really masala to life... Songs and fights appear on their own. Because... Life itself is a blockbuster! "Yes, you are the hero..." "You are the fighter..." "You are the hero, you are the fighter." "You are the saviour of the village." "You are a gift no one can say no to." "There's no one compared to you." "There's no way one can contain your anger..." "Your guts will never go low." "No matter who says what..." "All the criticism is welcome here." "Just keep rowing, don't stop." "Even if you are full, don't stop the hunt." "Everyone around us has one suggestion or the other..." "They keep drawing lines to make us stop progressing." "They even change our fate with their harsh words." "You don't even have the value of my sh..." "There is no way you can break me." "Come what may, I'm not going to stop." "Even if you through bricks at me..." "You'll find me building a huge palace with the same bricks." "This is not going to stop any soon." "Bark all you want, I'm not going to change." "Let's show they what we are made of." "All that we say to the haters is, 'Bro, heck the hell off'." "Don't ever worry my prince." "This fire inside you is never going to calm down." "You are one fresh liquor drum." "Your kick feels like an entire carnival." "Dude, no matter how much you try." "You can't change them!" "No matter what people say..." "Troll the haters..." "Troll the haters..." "You are the fire... You got desire..." "Your going higher..." "You are the fire... You got desire..." "Your going higher..." "Stop it!"
