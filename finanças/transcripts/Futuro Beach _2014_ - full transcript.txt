FUTURO BEACH Heiko! Hei... Heiko! Are you hurt? Come! Come! Calm down... Calm down... I THE DROWNED ONE'S EMBRACE - Hey. - Mom sent some food. What do we have today? French fries, lettuce... No, it's cassava. - Is it cassava? - Want some? I already ate, but... One more won't hurt. Hey, let me ask you something. Shoot. What would you do if I vanished in the ocean one day? Come on...! - What? - You're Aquaman, dude! How would Aquaman vanish in the ocean? Since he's already from there... Fine, but what if that shark took me? You'd just control it with your powers. Just that. Then it goes its own way. What if my powers failed? Then I'd take my diving kit, go there, jump in the water, and I would save you. Even with my fear of water, I'd save you. For that I would. - Let's go, partner. - Let's go. This ocean's treacherous, ain't it, Donny? Those guys think they can do anything. Yeah, but it's the first one I lost. - Hey... - What? You're the one who went looking, right? Did you see they were motocross racers? You need bravery for that... So crazy... They travel all around the world and come die in Futuro Beach. You speak Portuguese, don't you? Yes, I do. Sir, I'm here representing the Firefighters of the State of Ceara, to notify you that unfortunately your friend's a drowning victim. His body was not yet found, but usually the bodies wash up on the shore from 1 to 3 days after the accident. I brought... your clothes, and his... And I insisted to be the one to tell you because I was there at the time of the event. And I'm here in case you want to ask me something, doubts... - Are you still looking for him? - Yes. The search goes on for up to 10 days after the drowning. I'm really sorry, sir. Futuro Beach is a very dangerous one. Excuse me. Sir. Let me give you a ride. No. It's fine, thank you. My car's outside, let me drive you. OK. Do you have a cigarette? No. You have so many tattoos... Are any of those for your friend? Heiko? No. He was my friend. We met in Afghanistan. We were part of the same squad. Kabul. Companions. We traveled a lot together. Our next would've been south, in Patagonia. Heiko's dream was to go to Patagonia. It was our last trip together. Then he wanted to go back... to Berlin. No more traveling. To be with... his wife and son. To have another son. To run the bike shop, we... We had a bike shop together. The ship is passing the rocks. Be careful with the ship. Gusts of wind are coming from the East, towards the land. Copy that. Negative, negative. I'm trapped! Get out of here, monster! This is your end! You cannot stop me! No! - No, no! - Come on, you're going in. Aquaman's brother, afraid of water? Get off! It's shallow here, come! Look! Ayrton... Look. Do you want me to make you a beach with no water? Wow, dude. That's fast. The brake... Accelerate! He likes bikes, huh... I'm glad I found you. I wasn't even supposed to be here today, it's my day off. I just came to hang on the beach with my brother. Hey, Donny. Did you tell him who I am? Did you tell him I'm Speed Racer? He looks like Ghost Rider. - Because of the bike. - Just because of that. And what are you doing here today, on the beach? I spent the morning here, looking for my friend. This is all a landfill, where we are now. The ocean would go all the way there, then they filled it. It's as if we were in the middle of the ocean, now. Before, this was all ocean. These buildings weren't there. They were all houses. Just like Futuro Beach is now. But there are no buildings there because of the salty air. Second only to the Dead Sea. You can't construct buildings there. The salt is so violent that it goes in the concrete to corrode the iron. No one can have a fridge, or a TV... You go in the water, and find it all normal. You get used to people dying. The costs... The financial part... Do you understand me? I mean, sir... The bureaucratic costs, added to the funeral home's, will be paid by the family or by the insurance company. We'll also take a look at the prices for air transport, which is usually determined by the victim's weight. The consulate will intervene in all processes. The legal ones, the funeral's, and those related to the body repatriation. You surely are a relative of the victim. No. Well, in any case, I must inform you that the searches are over. Major, couldn't we send a chopper to Barra do Cau?pe, or Cumbuco... Just a minute, Private Donato. A minute, please. I think it unlikely what the private is suggesting. But we'll try. Now, if the body ever turns up, the German police will be informed, which will then inform the victim's family in Germany. After the family's been informed, the consulate will help provide for a family member to come. That person will then identify and escort the body. It happened a lot, the bodies washing up here. They get stuck in these rocks. Let's go in. Are you really leaving tomorrow? Yes. I can't do anything here. My friend's not coming back. Isn't that right? When you find him, call me. If I find him, will you stay? You can't get undressed here, man! Careful! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Legs! Don't stop! To the sea! II A HERO BROKEN IN HALF I feel like jumping in this water. At least take your clothes off first. Do you doubt it? One! Two! He's crazy! Too crazy... Look, the plants are all turning green. How do you say "green"? "Green"? - Gr?n. - Grun? - "Spring". - What? How do you say "spring"? - Fr?hling. - Fruhling? Thank you. Is that all? Cigarettes. Thanks. Nuclear Physics. Nuclear Physics. Nuclear... Excuse me, may I help you? You cannot be in here. Please, leave. Are you feeling better? I can't believe you're leaving. Wasn't this winter over? It feels even colder. Donato, why don't you stay? Don't leave. I don' think I can live in a place with no beach like this. My life, Konrad... I have a life, a mom... A brother... to support. I have a job, I've got work to do. So... I'll leave everything there and do what here? Huh? If you want to stay, we can work it out. This, and this of mine... It's not just you, it's... It's not just you. Coward. What? What did you call me? Come on, tell me. - What was that? - Coward. Coward. Am I wrong? Can you swim? Can you? My brother calls me Aquaman, my brother Ayrton... He does. - Aquaman? - Aquaman. Hey, stop being sad, Brazilian. Everything will be alright in the future. I heard everyone in Brazil is happy. Every time someone drowned there in Fortaleza, I thought it could've been me. - Hey, Donato! - How are you? I heard you were going back to Brazil. Have a nice trip, man. What? Here. Are you traveling with this fever? Next station: Ostkreuz. Connection with lines: 41, 42, 5, 7, 75, 8, 85 and 9. Passengers heading to Sch?nefeld Airport, please take the connection here. - What time do you arrive? - 14:00. It'll be 19:00 here. Exit to your left. Postdam Central Station. Please keep your distance. III A GERMAN-SPEAKING GHOST - Work time's over, Nana. - Have a nice weekend. Work's over. Hey, mister. Have you missed me? You forgot me, didn't you? Traitor. You traitor. Want some milk? - Want some? - No, I don't. When did you arrive? This train keeps circling around. I've been here for two weeks. And mom? Did you leave her alone? How are the girls? They're there. One of them is gone, lives on the beach with her little pothead boyfriend. The other one went to Rio de Janeiro. Rio de Janeiro? She works as a secretary, in a TV station, something like that. And mom? Tell me, how's mom? Is she OK? Mom died, Donato. Died with something on her lungs. Do you want the date? It was 1 year, 5 months and 3 days ago. That's when I started gathering money to come here. To know if you were dead or alive. Mom died, I grew up... Iracema beach is full of Italians, Germans... It's not because you turned your back to the world that we'll just sit and wait. It's not because you left that we'll just wait for you. Is that what you thought? No, I didn't. Why did you leave? Come on, answer me! Why did you disappear? You're a selfish faggot. You like being fucked here in this North Pole. Please. My brother showed up out of nowhere. And now? How are you? We haven't seen each other for a long time. Hi. You're... Ayrton? Is everything OK? You can't keep running away from your family. You vanished, what did you expect? I want to fuck your asshole. It's cold, wait. Wait. I'll fuck your asshole. Let me fuck your asshole. I'll... I'll... Let me go. Dakota! - Ayrton! - Dakota! What do you want? Is playtime over? Did you think you were getting away that easy? My bike has GPS, Ayrton. - And you, who are you? - Dakota. - Dakota? - Shut up. Is that your coat, Dakota? You can go now, Dakota. Here. Ayrton. Your brother's worried about you. That's just stupid. Shut up. Bike rider. You shouldn't smoke. Where did you learn German? Where did you learn German? - My German? - Yes, your German. Where? I learned to talk to my brother. I thought he had forgotten Portuguese. He forgets things too easily. I thought he had died, turned into a German-speaking ghost. Ayrton. Here. Take a shower. Go. What? You should talk to Ayrton. Put the cigarette out. Put it out. How did you get in here without a name tag? I told them I wanted to fuck you. Leave. Leave. - No. - Let me work, OK? Leave me alone. I want to be alone. What? I'm not leaving until you listen. Did you understand me? Your brother's at my place. I'm sorry about your mother. I had a weird dream yesterday. You were coming from the beach, carrying my body. A strong wind on my face, but it was not the ocean's. Salt on my hair, but it wasn't the beach's... I was laying down in an empty land, and my bike slipped as if everything was made of ice. A tire would come out flying over my head. I saw you leaving with a glass mask. Like Alien's. And I would look at you, laying on the asphalt. Pretty. Let's go. I always wanted to bring you here. Ever since I found this beach, where the ocean disappears. Where does it go to? Can you see that blue line? Now look down. You're in the ocean, bro. The water goes down for some kilometers that way, and then comes back at night. So this is the middle of the ocean? That's why I thought you'd love this beach. No water. No water. From Aquaman to Speed Racer: I write to tell you I didn't die. I just came back home. Here in this underwater city, everything makes more sense. I don't need to hide myself in the ocean to feel at peace, or dive to feel free. And every time someone asks me how it's like on the outside, I tell them of a boy that thinks he's not brave, but is the bravest man I've seen. Skinny, while everyone's strong. Thin voice, while everyone's virile. Small feet, while everyone's firm. I tell them of a boy and that he's my brother. That he's me, when I get brave enough to accept how much I'm afraid of things. Because there are two types of fear and bravery, Speed: Mine is the one where we pretend nothing's dangerous. Yours is the one that knows that everything's dangerous in this huge ocean.
