(suspenseful music) (pleasant music) (ominous music) (tires screeching) You want to watch where you're going! Pretty you may be. (car engine rumbling) Dr. Hill? [Blonde Woman] Yes. Professor Steiner is expecting you. I'm Sheila Anderson, the department secretary. Would you come in here, please? (knocking) Dr. Hill, Professor Steiner. Come in, come in. Oh, it's wonderful to see you again. And piggy to you. I do apologize. On the spur-of-the-moment, I could think of no other code name for you to give to the guards. That wasn't what I meant. You haven't changed. Seeing you standing there as if the years had suddenly dropped away. Paul, that was a long time ago. What's the problem that you want to discuss with me? (sighing) Oh, thank you, Miss Anderson. Oh, Miss Anderson, is Dr. Mitchel in? Yes sir, he went into the lab. Would you ask him to set up a test run? I'll be along presently. At once, sir. I'm working on the conversion of solid objects into pure energy. Energy which can be stored in a cell composition, projected over long distances and then turned back into the object again. All kinds of objects, including human tissue. Human tissue? Yes. Television! Television is one method of transferring a visual image from one place to another. But the image is flat, two-dimensional, lacks life and needs a receiver. What I have achieved is the projection of an object in three dimensions, something that has weight, depth and body and without a receiver. Yesterday, I achieved my first projection of a living creature. Unfortunately, something went wrong and the subject died. For how long did it live? Oh, two to three minutes. I want you to tell me why it died. Whether there was any change in the cellular structure during projection. What I need to correct. What's the principle that you employ? I'll show you. Come with me. Mitchel? I'd like you to meet Dr. Hill. She'll be joining us on our project. You could say we met before. Well, almost. Mitchel is an expert on laser. I'm afraid I know very little about it. Oh, well then fit her out with a heat suit, explain it to her and I'll go set up the console. There? Professor Steiner? I had to tell Dr. Blanchard you wanted another experimental run. And? He's given his permission on this occasion. In the future he requires 24 hours notice. And you've been instructed to see that he gets it? I have. Dr. Blanchard's the director of this foundation, isn't he? You can say that again. I'm in the middle. You were going to tell me about laser. Sorry. Well, I expect you know it's a way of overcoming a scattering of light waves. In it's simplest form, we put an electric current through a mixture of neon and helium gases. Now the light is amplified and emitted, it becomes a coherent source of power. You mean it doesn't go off in all directions. Exactly. It's one very narrow beam that can transmit more signals than all the television and radio channels put together. It's light in a new form, which I have modified to transmit matter itself. (machinery buzzing) Now I'd like to demonstrate with something of your own. Something you'd recognize. My watch do? Couldn't be better. Come with me. (machinery humming) This is the transmission cradle. It creates a massive magnetic field. Now, the watch. Now, put your visor on and stand back. But keep your eye on the watch. (machinery buzzing) What has happened at this stage is that the basic matter of the watch has been transformed into pure energy and is stored over there in that cell. Forever, if necessary. Now, we wish to transmit that energy to project the watch, in fact. (machinery humming) Laser preheat. [Chris] Laser preheat in. (buzzing) [Paul] Laser emission relay. Laser emission relay... On. (electrical pulsing) Relay one. Relay on in. (machinery ringing) Relay two. [Chris] Relay two, on. (machinery ringing) Project. (fizzling) Now, we'll see what happened to your watch. (machinery powering down) It's incredible. I succeed every time with an inanimate object. If only I could do the same thing with a living creature. Unfortunately there's a gap between the molecular structure of metal and that of living tissue, which I must bridge. What are these burns? That's some we still don't quite understand. Paul, look at the watch. Would it be possible for the direction of the magnetic field, the polarity, to change in projection? I suppose it could. I've never really thought about it. We better start thinking about it. If this kind of distortion is present, no wonder the guinea pig died. (fizzling) Hot? No, a shock. Maybe there is something in my theory. Look what the shock has done. (ominous music) No human being could survive a time transition of that kind. Not without fearful consequences. (foreboding music) Who are you? I'm assisting Professor Steiner. Who are you? Dr. Blanchard, director of this foundation. Well then you should know better than to startle me when I'm focusing a microscope. Let me see your identification card. Certainly. This is a classified division, the work is secret. No one is allowed in without my permission. She has permission. Mine. Dr. Hill is working here at my own expense. Even so, an arrangement of that sort requires my authority. What name did you say? Dr. Hill. Dr. Patricia Hill. (chuckling) I'm extremely sorry, Dr. Hill. I apologize. For a moment, I didn't recognize you. Maybe it's my overall or the lighting. I'm sure you will be of great assistance to Professor Steiner. She already has been. With her help, I'm on the verge of demonstrating proof of my theory. (chuckling) I am glad to hear it. Oh, by the way, Steiner, I hope Dr. Mitchel made it quite clear this morning that I can not agree again to these demonstrations being taken at short notice. Quite clear. You see, I have to warn other projects that may be needing power. These matters have to be properly programmed. I said Dr. Mitchel made your point. Good. Well, I won't interrupt you any further. Goodnight, Professor Steiner. Dr. Hill. Please don't think the foundation finds you unwelcome. Thank you, Dr. Blanchard. Paul, look at this. Why didn't you tell me about Professor Steiner's arrangement with Dr. Hill? He said he'd tell you himself. What Professor Steiner wanted to tell me himself is immaterial. You represent me on this project. I hope you haven't forgotten where your loyalties lie. My loyalties belong to the foundation. Very proper. Miss Anderson, I have agreed that Dr. Hill be working here for a short time. But I must emphasize that in future, no visitor to this department must be admitted without my personal authority. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Ha. What are you doing? Dictating reports. Well leave it. Come with me. Mitchel, I want you to regard what I'm about to say as highly confidential. Yes, sir. I've been instructed that next Tuesday the ministry is sending Professor Lembach of the Geneva Institute down to witness a demonstration of Professor Steiner's projection experiment. Professor Lembach, yes. Obviously it will be necessary for you to know you will have preparations to make but I would be obliged if you didn't mention the visit to Professor Steiner. That is, for the time being. But Dr. Blanchard... Mitchel, please, please. There are reasons why the visit should not be announced. I will, myself, inform Professor Steiner in ample time. In that case, why tell me? As I said, Mitchel, you are my representative, not Steiner's. That should be sufficient. I still don't understand. (chuckling) It's not going to be as simple as we thought. I had hoped that Lembach's visit would throw him, but he seems to be more advanced than I'd imagined. He's brought in a pathologist. You're in no position to allow anything to go wrong now. [Blanchard] But what can I do? My hands are tied. You'll have to use your position with the ministry to delay the demonstration until I found out how far he's got. Put it off? After I've spent three exhausting days heckling the minister to arrange it? But you have to accept that things have changed in three days. He may have achieved some sort of breakthrough. I must find out before any official demonstration... I'm quite uninterested. Really, I am. That demonstration will take place but it will fail. Steiner must be discredited in front of an official party. [Blanchard] But Latham, how can I possibly make sure that it will fail? If not, there are certain aspects of your warm and cozy private life that suddenly will become much more widely known. All right! All right! [Latham] Good! We're agreed then. (ominous music) (machinery humming) (buzzing) (electrical pulsing) (ringing) (triumphant music) (heart monitor beating) I'll have to do a more careful examination but I think I can pronounce the patient fit and well. (laughing) Paul, that's splendid. Congratulations. Hey, do I get a kiss too? It needed such a tiny adjustment to counteract that time phase. There's nothing to prevent me from calling the ministry and arranging a demonstration. Chris, get the glasses. I think we deserve a celebration. This is really going to embarrass Blanchard. Don't be too hard on him. After all, it's his job and we're not one of his pet projects. You are too generous. Blanchard hasn't spoken to you. About what? Well if it's something that concerns us all, tell us. It's supposed to be confidential. He's arranged a demonstration. - He's done what? - [Patricia] When? For Tuesday. The ministry are bring Professor Lembach down. He told me days ago and ordered me not to tell you. What does he expect to gain? I can't believe it, unless he's so childish he thinks he can embarrass me. Chris, don't tell him you told me. Don't even tell him we've succeeded. I can be childish too and surprise him. I'm tremendously excited over this demonstration. May I take your glass, Professor Lembach? Danke schon, danke schon. (chuckling) In some ways, I think it's a pity your visit couldn't have be delayed, professor. I'm sure Steiner would prefer to demonstrate at a later date. There are urgencies. My ministry is anxious to take advantage of this offer of collaboration from Professor Lembach's. It's no so urgent, Mr. Latham, but my dear friend and colleague assures me my visit will not be wasted. Danke schon. Sheila? We also drink who only stand and wait. Then don't stand or wait. That's quite a performance of Blanchard's. If only he knew what was in store for him. I plea that you're not part of all that. Paul's very grateful to you. So am I. You knew him very well, didn't you? I worked with him once in Stockholm soon after I qualified. That's all. You're sure I wouldn't be treading on anyone's toes if I asked you to have dinner with me? No. I know what you mean, but that was all finished a long time ago. I'd be delighted. It's a remarkable development, Paul, but I don't understand how you've overcome the time element. Oh well, you will very soon. Shall we start? Mitchel, would you check that everything's ready? Yes, professor. (pleasant music) Where would you like to go? Chris, I'd rather Paul didn't know. But I thought you said... I did and I meant it. Oh I don't know, he's on edge. I wouldn't want to do anything that would precipitate... You see, he trusts us. What's that got to do with me taking you out to dinner? Nothing, really. It's just him and his work I'm thinking about. In here, Professor Lembach. (machinery humming) Ready? Ready. (machinery buzzing) Dr. Hill will show you the subject from the first part of our demonstration, which is the transformation of the subject into stored energy. Please watch the subject carefully when I give the signal to transmit. (machinery buzzing) Secondary relays in. [Chris] Secondary relays in. (machinery buzzing) Transmit. (machinery buzzing) The animal is now in the form of pure energy which is stored in that cell over there. I will now project the animal onto the target table. We have corrected the time lag element which caused death in our early experiments. Please watch the target table. (machinery pulsing) Laser preheat. [Chris] Laser preheat. In. Laser emission relay. [Chris] Laser emission relay... On. (machinery ringing) Relay one. Relay two. (machinery ringing) Project. (electrical popping) (fizzling) Cut the power! (sizzling) (steam hissing) The power line of the storage cell is completely burned out. Just like depriving the brain of blood. It's completely destroyed. So we can't project the rat? He's gone wherever good rats go. God, what was Mitchel ever thinking of? Why? What's it got to do with him? Maintenance is part of his function. Perhaps he's just loyal to Blanchard. Paul, that's unfair and you know it. I don't know anything anymore. What about Blanchard? Have you seen him? Oh, he ran off with Lembach and that man, Latham, like a scolded cat. You must explain. We must try and arrange another... Paul! What do you want? I've been checking. Well, it's a bit late for excuses. Paul, please. - I'm not making any. - [Chris] Look at this. A burn through. That's hardly surprising. Look at the leads. They're burned through, what should I expect? I specifically told you to check everything. I did! You still can't see what's wrong? Those are acid burns. Sabotage. When the power built up, the natural heat in the wires completed the rupture. I'm surprised we weren't all killed. Who would want to do such a thing? Somebody who wanted to make sure the experiment was never completed. Well, it doesn't make any difference. Will be months before we can be ready again. I can replace this overnight. You can't replace the storage cell. Without it, the apparatus is useless. I think it's only shorted. Well, if you're right, then we can recharge it. I'm darn sure we can. How long is Lembach staying? I'll find out. Pat. I'm afraid this takes precedence over dinner. Chris, what does I mean? The idea that somebody would want to destroy Paul's discovery, it frightens me. But if that was their intention, they certainly haven't succeeded. If we work day and night, get the apparatus in order, achieve another perfect projection, we can convince everyone, including Blanchard. Can I help? Well, I could always do with a mate. Lembach is staying in London another few days. Arrangements are being made for me to have dinner with him at Blanchard's house. Well then you'll be able to convince him. Yes but someone seems to be trying to prevent me. Paul, that's the voice of despair. I'm sure we can get it in order again. Do you think so? Yes, I do. If I stand here talking, I'll never even get started. Pat. I wish I could be fully sure I trust him. Why shouldn't you? You're the only one I have faith in now, Pat. Don't desert me. What do you mean? He's paid by the foundation, not by me. Pat, I've been watching both of you. Be very careful before you go too far. Paul, you're tired. I think you ought to go home and rest. I'll call you as soon as he's ready. No. I have to be sure that I'm ready. Why? What do you have in mind? An idea. Nothing more. (somber music) (banging) But I have succeeded! My dear Paul, this is neither the time nor the place to argue. Now we sit comfortably, digesting Dr. Blanchard's excellent dinner. I am not arguing. I am stating facts. I have only to call my two assistants who are waiting. I can arrange a demonstration tonight, now! Steiner. You are behaving inexcusably. You were only invited because Professor Lembach wanted to meet you again before returning to Geneva. This is unfair. My demonstration was ruined. Demonstrations do go wrong, Paul. I do not hold it against you. But I can not remain in London. I'm needed in Geneva. My demonstration was sabotaged. Nonsense. It's true. I have evidence. This is my evidence. It doesn't take a technical mind to see the acid burns on the ends of the connections. If there had been sabotage, Dr. Mitchel would've told me. At my request, he did not. Come with me and see for yourself! Steiner! I had no intention of telling you tonight, but now you are forcing me. Only this morning, my committee decided they've gone far enough. Your experiment will be abandoned. Tomorrow you will start dismantling your laboratory to make room for another and more urgent project. I can not accept your decision. It's monstrous. I've achieved success. You can not deny me my demonstration! You have no choice. How long will you gentlemen be here? Some time, why? Then I will give you evidence that will force you to reclaim my discovery. I can not allow my friend to leave in this state of mind. Professor? I think it would be better to leave him alone. Were you not hard on him, doctor? It was not of my seeking. In any case, he had to be told. Under the circumstances, this seemed as good a time as any. What were his prospects of success? Well, like most other advanced experiments, limited. When are you letting me have your views to put to my government? Within a few days, professor. Well, in that case, I shall be very glad if you will ask your committee to delay their final decision until I can see the process for myself. We must none of us forget just how brilliant a man, Professor Steiner, is. (phone ringing) Hello? Oh, Dr. Hill. No, he isn't back yet. Not back? Have you heard from him? No. It's getting very late. I can't stay much longer or I'll miss my bus. Who is it? It's Dr. Hill. Sheila, I need your help. Of course, professor. All right, come with me. (phone ringing) Leave it. But it'll be Dr. Hill again. I said leave it. (phone ringing) I want to know why Sheila put the telephone down. If he did... But he said he would call as soon as he was ready. I think something's wrong. I want to go back to the laboratory and find out what's happened. All right, all right. I want to know what's happened too. (car engine starting) (machinery humming) I'm sure I'll never get it right, professor. Now don't be frightened, Sheila. When I raise my hand, press this. When all these lights are on, press this. Yes. Press this, watch the lights. The sound will then die down and rebuild. I've programmed the entire second stage. All you have to remember is when all these lights are burning, press this. I understand, professor. Now don't be frightened. When this is all over, you can tell your boyfriends that you helped trigger an experiment that made scientific history. (machinery humming) (machinery buzzing) (machinery fizzling) Shelia! Don't touch anything! (ominous music) (machinery fizzling) (Paul gasping) He's trying to project himself. Sheila's disrupted the program. (fizzling) (Paul gasping) What do we do? Nothing. I can't stop the program. He wouldn't talk to us. He knew we'd try and stop him. (Paul screaming) (suspenseful music) (electrical pulsing) He doesn't intend bringing himself back to the target table. (machinery ringing) Stop her Chris! (machinery fizzling) (ominous music) (clanking) Don't push it too hard. We got plenty of time. Shut up, Gloria. Three more minutes and we're done. I'll go and take a look, see if you've open up the neighborhood. You get at it. I meant get at that. There will be time for the other, later. (cat meowing) What's that? How the hell should I know? A cat, I expect. Never heard a cat make a noise like that. Perhaps he was having a bit of fun and she wasn't in the mood. (chuckling) (clanking) (cat screaming) (electrical fizzling) There you are, Gloria, what did I tell you? A flipping cat. Relax girl, relax. All right. Oh God, I could do with a drink. You'll be getting something more than a drink when we get through this lot. (laughing) Steve, hurry! There's someone over there by that mound. I can see him moving. Well go and take a look. If it's a bloke, chat him up. But keep him away from here. (tools clanking) Hello there. Have you got the time? (man groaning) (screaming) (electrical fizzling) What the bloody hell did she scream like that for? How should I know? I'm gonna go and take a look. Gloria? Gloria? Gloria? Come on, girl, wake up. Don't muck about. No. (footsteps crunching) (screaming) (electrical fizzling) Gloria? Harry? Where the hell are you? (ominous music) (footsteps crunching) (gasping) (electrical fizzling) (menacing music) (suspenseful music) (electrical fizzling) (ominous music) [Woman] Darling, get me some asprin from the shop. [Boy] All right, mom. (footsteps thumping) [Woman] Don't worry, dear. I found a bottle in the dressing table. (foreboding music) Electrocution? We found them slap in the middle of a building site. There was no power cable within a hundred yards. Come and look. The burns are typical. (phone ringing) That'll be for me. Inspector Davis. Ah, Martin, you got it? One's Harry Slinger, The woman's Gloria King, which must make the over Steve Lowe. That's got to make quite a whole in the road scary. I'm sorry about old Harry, though, he was so bloody bad at it. What were they up to, exactly? Of all things, digging away into the furriers. So crude, they nearly got away with it. Want their pictures? Wait a minute. Will I be able to recognize them? No, don't bother. Just round up a few relatives for formal identification. The cause of death, I'm told, was electrocution. You better get down there and see if you can find out any reason why. Electrocution? Yes, I know. See you later. Well, let's have a look. You chaps amaze me. I barely finish an examination and here you are putting names to them. We amaze ourselves sometimes. Yeah, that's Lowe all right. Well, well, well. I've seen Harry in a good many positions, but I never expected to see him in this one. You silly old fool. And the woman's here, on the table. I say she was scared too. All three had a similar look. Something else that might interest you. Another body. Another? It, too, died of electrocution. I thought that damned Lembach would never go. What's on Steiner's mind? Something pretty spectacular, if I know him. Has he repaired the damage? I don't know. He and Mitchel have been working day and night. You ought to get your hands on those tapes of his. You're still sure they are the key to his experiments? Yes, they are. Yes. We should get them tonight, before he removes them himself. Yeah, we can get them now. We? You then. I hardly think it's my line of country. I can't do it by myself. I've got to take care of the security man. Now, this is what we'll do. I will drive into the foundation with you concealed in the boot of my car. I'll give you my keys, you find your way up into the main laboratory, help yourself to the tapes. In the meantime, I'll take the security man up to my office and that way, no suspicion will fall on me. Or on you either, of course. Well? Come on. (car horn honking) I want you. We've been trying to get you on the telephone, sir. Me? What for? Yes, it's Dr. Mitchel, sir. He's waiting up in your office with Dr. Hill and Miss Anderson. There's been some trouble in Professor Steiner's laboratory. Is Professor Steiner still here? Well, he did come in here earlier, sir. Anybody in the laboratory? No sir. Did you want me for anything, sir? Doesn't matter now. (knocking) (suspenseful music) Well, it seems just as well that I decided to return tonight. Even so, I find your explanation pure fantasy. To me it makes sense. He was obviously trying to project himself. The cross on the map is exactly on your house. With these calibrations he worked out distance and trajectory from the foundation. The graph bears me out. And you are seriously suggesting that he would materialize himself in my study? Well, perhaps not in your study, but in your house, certainly. Dr. Hill, I can understand how upset you are, but what you suggest is illogical. There is nothing illogical in what I am saying. Then tell me, where is he now? We can't. Sheila unwittingly disturbed the program. He could be anywhere in any state. (Sheila whimpering) Do we have to kep Sheila here? She looks exhausted. (crying) It's my eyes. They're hurting. I'm sorry, Sheila. Maybe you should see a doctor. All right, I'll see to it. It's past 2 o'clock in the morning. How will you get home? I can't. Look, look, look. You just run to your office and get those clothes off. I'll see that you're driven home. (whimpering) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) It was an unfortunate accident. None of you can blame yourselves. What exactly happened at your house earlier tonight? Circumstances forced me to tell him the project had been canceled. You can't mean it. Not now. It's already been done. As for you, Mitchel, you're suspended from your duties pending an investigation into your conduct during the course of the project. (ominous music) (menacing music) (yelling) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (electrical fizzling) (gasping) (electrical fizzling) (clicking) Well, no point of staying here in the dark. The cancellation is final. Nothing more to be said about it. But I must impress upon you both that the work of this foundation is classified. There's no need to remind us. We both signed the official secret oath. All I need do is to emphasize the necessity of keeping your mouths shut. (suspenseful music) (whimpering) [Paul] Sheila! (menacing music) There seems no reason why Dr. Mitchel and I can not complete the experiment just to show what success we've achieved if for Dr. Steiner's sake. A nice sentiment, Dr. Hill. You assume I noticed that Professor Steiner, himself, would not be able to continue. But I didn't mean... Don't fool yourself, Blanchard. He has succeeded and once more he will be back here, in his office, at any time. Then, if he retains his faculties, he will know that it will not be to much purpose. Sometimes you're so cruel that I think you must have some other motive. Miss Anderson is... She will think I have forgotten her. [Patricia] Oh, that man gives me the shutters. Well, he certainly has a whip pan now. (ominous music) (menacing music) (suspenseful music) God, I'm tired. What would you like, a drink? Yes, please. Is it such a little while ago since we've been here? About four hours. Don't look so worried. We don't know what's happened. It's not the end of the world anyway. For Paul it could be. You really are fond of him, aren't you? Of course. But it's you I love. (dramatic music) (whimpering) Please, let me go. Not until you've answered my questions. What do you know about this man, Latham? But I'm only a secretary. You helped me once. Help me again. It's my eyes. They're hurting. Dr. Mitchel thought I ought to see a doctor, Professor Stei... It's all right, Sheila, you can use the name. I know who I am. Tell me about Latham, then we'll see about a doctor. Well, he spent a lot of time with Dr. Blanchard, but no one ever knew what he was exactly. What do you think he was doing, Sheila? Spying on us? Please, Professor, I don't know. Truly, I don't. When I wasn't there, did either of them go into the lab without me? Oh yes. Wasn't it all right? No, it wasn't. How often? Several times. Mostly Mr. Latham by himself. Why didn't you tell me? Wasn't for me to question him, professor. I thought you'd know. Please, can I go and bath my eyes now? Did they ask you to keep it as a secret? Don't worry, I'm not going to harm you. Did they? Well, not exactly. Not exactly? Either you know or you don't, which is it? Well, Dr. Blanchard did tell me once that I was working for the foundation, not you. I see. All right, Sheila, go an bath your eyes. Then I can go? We'll see. How long ago did you leave me? Just as long as it takes to make coffee. You move to quietly. Come back to bed. Don't you realize that it's a new day? There's been no word? No. Here, drink your coffee. I'll telephone. (phone ringing) Yes? Oh, Dr. Blanchard. Yes. Yes, as quickly as we can. Something dreadful has happened at the lab. Is it him? Blanchard didn't say, but he sounded frightened. How much longer will they be? Any moment, I should think. Dr. Hill, Dr. Mitchel. It's not... I am sorry to bring you back. Who were you expecting it to be? We were half expecting it to be Professor Steiner. I see. Now answer my questions quickly. I want my squad here fast and until this official secret thing's cleared up, I can't. What was on those computers? Programmed tapes of our experiments. Where are they? That's roughly what I'm asking you. Now don't touch anything. I wasn't going to. There's no need to look any further. These were the tapes. Dr. Blanchard tells me you are a pathologist. Until my surgeon gets here, is there anything you can tell me about how he died? At first sight, I would say electrocution. Can you see anything that would account for that? No. I think I can. There's too much for it to be a coincidence. I've seen the very same thing earlier on. Well, there's no possible doubt why the lights when out last night. Somebody's fused the main power line. You mean, him? No, he's still be hanging there, charred to a cinder. What about those tapes? As far as I can tell, they're all there. The result of several years of work in ruins. You mean all your programs? Every single one. [Blanchard] Don't you have records, notes? Not one. For security reasons, the tapes weren't transcribed. We were going to do it when the experiments were completed. But you could replace them. No. Not without Steiner. [Inspector] Can I get on? Yes, inspector. If the tapes are destroyed, then there is nothing left of a secret nature. What was Latham doing here? That is for the inspector to determine. Thank you. What time did the lights go out? [Chris] Oh it was about 2:15, wasn't it? Just about. Inspector, I will be in my office when you want me. [Inspector] Don't leave the building without letting me know. I had no such intention. This experiment Dr. Blanchard was talking about, the one that brought you back here last night, tell me about it. [Patricia] Well we left Professor Steiner completing some important work. We got anxious about him and he telephoned. (phone ringing) (ominous music) (phone ringing) Yes? [Cigar Man] Is Latham with you? Who's that? [Cigar Man] Where is Latham, Blanchard? I ask, who's that speaking? I'm an associate. In fact, you might say that we are very close. You understand? Latham's dead. [Cigar Man] Then who has the tapes? The tapes have been destroyed. [Cigar Man] Destroyed? How did that happen? I don't know what went wrong. [Cigar Man] Then you will kindly rearrange our affairs so that they do succeed. No, it's finished. [Cigar Man] On no, Dr. Blanchard, it is not finished. I don't pay such large sums of money for failure! Never forget, I still have those photographs in my safe. I can do no more. [Cigar Man] Now will you listen to me, Blanchard? I wish I'd never... [Cigar Man] Listen to me, Blanchard! You sold yourself to me a long time ago! It's too late now to tell me that you wish to change your mind! Now presuming Professor Steiner is still alive, in what state do you expect him to be? We've no idea what effect the interruption of the program would have. Where's this place you found the body? Corner of Evanston Street. You realize that's not above a quarter of a mile from where Blanchard lives. It couldn't be. Why not? From what you've told me of his experiments, do you really believe that it's beyond the realms of possibility? I know of nothing in the concept of the human body that could cause an imprint like that. I've seen several like it. Where did he go? But if he has been in some way transmuted, we don't know what intelligence he would have retained. Presuming that he did do this, them he must've been capable of finding his way back here. So why don't we try his apartment? But I can't stop here. Someone will be starting to look for me. My mom, most likely. Didn't you tell her you would be working late? Oh, she's used to me being out all hours. Anyway, Dr. Blanchard was going to have me driven home. Blanchard! Has he taken a liking to you? He is my boss. That I'm beginning to understand. Blanchard! (sizzling) (fire crackling) Don't leave me alone! (fire crackling) (gasping) (Sheila whimpering) Somebody help! Please! Please help me! Let me out! Somebody help me, please help me! Somebody help! Let me out! Please let me out! (siren alarming) Don't worry, Sheila, he won't come near you again. You've done fine. You've helped me a lot. Thank you. I feel a bit better now. Good. You know where Blanchard lives? Yes. Come on, I hope we're not too late. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (sizzling) Steiner. Oh my god. Oh no. No. No, wait. Wait, Steiner, wait! No! (sizzling) (foreboding music) If the girl hadn't stay unconscious for so long, we might have prevented this. After what she said, as you still in any doubt? Afraid not. Do you know anywhere else he's likely to go? Those people on the building site. Do you think he killed them accidentally? I think he panicked and just didn't know what would happen when he touched them. As far as I know, there's no one else from the foundation he would go after. He's probably try and hold up somewhere. Now that his flat's burnt up, could he go back to the lab? We've got that covered. We'll just have to go on looking. I should imagine a few frightened people will soon put me on to him. Where will you be? At home. I'll just take the address and telephone number in case I have to disturb you. (ominous music) (woman laughing) I feel so helpless lying here. Shouldn't we be out looking for him? Where would we look? They'll call us as soon as he's located. Chris, why did this have to happen? It was Blanchard's doing with Latham behind him. Paul knew that. Well whatever they did, they've paid for it. Chris, I'm so pleased you're here, I couldn't bear this alone. You don't have to. (ominous music) (sizzling) Paul! Paul, how did you get in? Why didn't you send for us instead of using Sheila? It was madness. I am not mad. Why use Sheila? Why not us? Don't you trust us? You dare to ask if I trust you. But you can, Paul. No! You want to destroy me so you can go on with your love making. Why did you come here, then? I need power. Power to help me think clearly. But you can get it, at the lab, while I program a tape to cure you. I'll find it myself. And I see where I can get it. Paul, you can't walk around London. In some way, you'll be destroyed. Let them try. Steiner, I know what's wrong with you. Liar! I mean, this energy discharge that kills people. I couldn't realign the laser beam. The magnetic field was out of step as in the early experiments. Paul, I beg you, do what Chris asks. He just wants to get me out of the way. Steiner! Unless you have us help you, there's not hope for you. You destroyed all our tapes when you kill Latham. If I can get back to the lab, I can begin to program a reversal tape. What can anyone do about that? Let him go. Can we? We must think of a way of getting him back to the lab. It's the only way he can be helped. (dial cranking) Get me Inspector Davis. This is urgent. You can't, Chris. Give me an alternative. Inspector Davis? This is Dr. Mitchel. I know where you can find Professor Steiner. (suspenseful music) All right, we're going in. Thompson, find out who's in charge here. Tell him what's going on and tell him to keep his people out of this section until I give the word it's safe. Right, sir. The rest of you, you got your special issue? Yes, sir. The first sign of resistance, shoot and shoot straight if you want to keep alive. Now then. They can't mean to shoot him down. If he refuses to be helped, he'll have to be destroyed. But he was so gentle. Try to think of him as he is, not as he was. Think of him as the Projected Man who has nothing in common with Paul Steiner. Open the gates, we're going in now. (suspenseful music) Now form up. Don't take any unnecessary risks. [Officer] There he is! (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) Aim carefully! Make sure you hit him! (sparks sizzling) (suspenseful music) Stop! It's not good, inspector. Bullets aren't gonna stop him. Drive straight at him! (suspenseful music) Get behind the car again. Keep down. Inspector. What is it? If you go in there, someone's going to get killed. Any suggestions? Only that somehow we've got to persuade him to come back with us to the laboratory. And how do you expect to do that? Let me go. I'll get him to come back. Don't be crazy. Look at that. You can't go in there alone. Chris, you go back to the laboratory and start programming a reversal tape. The inspector will watch out for me. I will if he goes with you. No, I must go alone. Paul? Paul? Where are you? Paul, you must trust me. (booming) (gasping) Paul, don't you realize every time you discharge energy like that you weaken yourself. Leave me alone. Go away! Let me find more power. Paul, come back to the laboratory. Let us work together to get you well. Nothing can help me. (fizzling) Paul, why are you doing that? To frighten me? Chris has gone back. Chris? Is he all you can think about? (shock sizzling) Go away. Go back to your Chris. You want me to destroy myself. (ominous music) Paul, I beg you. Come back to the laboratory. We can give you all the energy that you need. You promise this isn't a trap? [Inspector] Dr. Hill, are you all right? Go away! Keep out! So it was a trap? Look Paul, I'm tired too. I'm going to go back to the car. You can follow me if you wish. (dramatic music) Wait. (machinery humming) [Chris] If you fuse the switchboard now, I can not do anything. The console is programmed for a reversal process. Get away! It's all over. Finished. (machinery humming) (buzzing) What the hell is he doing? (booming) Can't we stop him? It's the reversal program. The projector has become an instrument of destruction. Look! (buzzing) (booming) (fire crackling) (booming) Paul! (fizzling) (crackling) (booming) (buzzing) (intense music) (fire rumbling) (suspenseful music)
