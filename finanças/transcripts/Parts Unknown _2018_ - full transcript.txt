(SHOUTING) (SPACEY FUTURISTIC MUSIC) CROWD: Go, go! (CROWD SHOUTING) Get him off! Get him off. (SPACEY FUTURISTIC MUSIC) (CROWD SHOUTING) Oh, God! That hurt, why you so stiff? Take it home, man. Stop! Will you guys help me? Will you guys help me? PRONE MAN: What are you talking about? STANDING MAN: Tell me how this feels, huh? - No, no, no, no, no. - How you like this, kid, huh? Come on, man. (GROANING) No, no, no, no, no, no. (GROANING) STANDING MAN: You wanna be a wrestler? You wanna be a wrestler? - Come on, man! - You wanna be a wrestler? You wanna be a big wrestler? Damn it. Damn it, my shoulder's out. MAN: Inflict the most pain you can, you son of a bitch. Shut up. (FUTURISTIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Take that, you ingrate (SPEAKER DROWNED OUT BY CROWD). (GROANING) (FUTURISTIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) REFEREE: Step the fuck away. (FUTURISTIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (SHOUTING AND CHEERING) (FUTURISTIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (GAGGING) (FUTURISTIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (CHEERING AND SHOUTING) My brother, my brother! He's my brother! (SHOUTING) (PULSING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Thank God that animal was let off with only a manslaughter charge. He's already out on probation, and he's not getting any gigs for a while. He's coming to collect the chump change I owe him. Why'd you want him out of the can so bad? That no-selling piece of shit can rot. Why do you think? I'm a cunt hair away from a major law suit. I couldn't afford a murder in my ring. Besides, half the roster's ready to walk out as is. Speaking of which, your last check bounced. With all due respect, maybe you bounce next. You idiots know you owe me. Don't look at me like I'm stupid. I created you both. Now that's enough talk of my banking situation. You know it's not gonna last this way forever, boss. Look, just give me a month. I'll book a big show and we'll sell it out. Sell it out? What are you gonna sell out, the local VFW hall? What, the Quincy High gymnasium? Jesus, you might as well stage a real street fight. That's not a bad idea. No holds barred. MAN IN BLACK: Jesus Christ! He's actually digging this. Fuck! Boys, have I let you down before? That's all you do, asshole. Something big is coming, boys, I can feel it. (KNOCKING) Yes, kid, I already read the Dirt Sheets. You don't even have to ask. You wanna be booked. Next gig's gonna be sold out. You know my brother's gonna butcher me, right? You're looking at the last Von Strasser still working for the big leagues. Kid, there's still money to be made here. I failed two owner's violations. You don't think I'm a risk? Did you hear? Your brother just got out of jail for killing a jobber, some piece of shit from New York. May he rest in peace. At least I didn't have to pay. No fucking way. No fucking way. He's out on probation, no big deal. Kid, we are going places. You are still fresh in the eyes of the casual fans. No, you know what, this is all a little too much. MAN IN BLACK: Go on, man up, kid. I've been hearing shit like that from Hermann for years. So I juiced! Now I'm a dead man. Dead man? What are you, 27? Jesus, you got three years to make it. That's not enough. You can just stay here. No need to worry about greener pastures. Fuck that corporate sellout sports entertainment crap. This is wrestling. This is wrestling? Fuck you. Fuck you, fuck you! Fuck your whole freak show. That went well. So what's next? For one, Hermann's gonna try and kill me. We all know the Von Strassers' love of self-pity. The old man offed himself when he had nothing left in the tank. He trained the kids to get out of the biz and boom. Hermann sees his kid brother fucked up like that, he's gonna want his money and he's gonna fucking kill me. Well, your next check better not bounce. You need us now. Yeah, it's not, shut the fuck up with that shit. (SOFT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (GROANING) (SOFT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Oh, well look what the cat dragged in. Well, sounds like you two juice-heads are ready to get your asses kicked tonight. It's cause of clowns like you two, we can't get a regular paycheck. Yeah, Gary keeps hiring you one-off acts, bullshit. You know what? Someone's gotta do the job! Hey, hey, back the fuck up! You boys know how this works. Oh yeah, we know how it works. MAN IN BLACK: I'll cut your guts out! You guys are fucking crazy. (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Hey, hey, save it for the ring, boys. Let's make wrestling great again, okay? (DRONING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) MAN: Hi, everyone, I'm backstage with the Von Strassers. - How do you feel... - Shut the hell up! We don't give a damn what you have to say. This man to the right of me, my brother in arms, he's going to tear his opponent limb from limb. There is nowhere to run. There is nowhere to hide, baby! You punks think you have my number? Well, I have something you'll never have. The fear of death does not imprison me. I eat it like candy. I thrive on chaos. While y'all are at home saying your prayers and eating your vitamins, I am preying on the souls of the innocent. Tonight, you will witness the death of all your heroes. You will witness the end of all your heroes, for I will wear their blood tonight! I think what Hermann's trying to say - is that he's gonna stop... - Shut up, you little hippy with a bad tie on! I do my own talking! Remember what I said, you don't like my style, get out of my arena! You don't like my style, get out of my world, get out of my universe, for tonight, all beauty must die. Turn it off. When's your brother getting home? I don't know, he's probably working out somewheres. We had an appointment, I don't care. There you are. Yeah, here I am. Turn down that fucking music! Going to ask you a few questions. Really. Have you taken any drugs or alcohol, or is that a stupid question? Me, I'm sober, but Harvey here has got a few problems, though. Yeah, I do. See, Harvey's taken too many chair shots to the head, so he don't think so clear no more, but he makes one hell of a watchdog in this house. I'd do anything for this family. Happy to hear you have a great home life. Don't treat me like an idiot, Von Strasser, I'll send you to prison. Get out of our house, you bitch! Easy, Harvey. Bitch here's just doing her job. Ain't that right, bitch? So that's how it's going to be? I'm going to have to order a drug test. I'll save you the trouble. I got a guy. I'm on antibiotics and I'm on painkillers cause of all the nerve damage I got. Sorry to hear that, but... You know, I sacrificed for you. I sacrificed for everyone. This how you thank me? I never watched your show. Show, really? So it's all fake to you, just a television program? It's goddamn real! You want more injuries? What's one more? What? You think I ain't been shot before? Maybe I'll just aim for the head. HERMANN: Maybe you'll have to, cunt. (JITTERY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) So, you coming to the event tonight? What event? My in-ring debut. What? Yeah, I've been watching all your old tapes. I think I'm finally ready. No more Lacey the ring girl. Who trained you? No one, I got the idea from you. (FLESHY SMACK) LACEY: Ow, Kitty, what the fuck? Do you think this is a fucking game? You're nothing but a little whore. Do you even know what I went through to get on TV? LACEY: You'd suck anything, Jesus. You're a nobody! You're young, that's about it. Didn't say you weren't gonna get re-signed. KITTY: You probably think I wouldn't even pass a fucking drug test. Yeah, neither of us would. We're high as fuck right now. (SCREAMING) I'm the former Women's Champion. I've seen the big time, I've wrestled all over the fucking world, little girl, and I'll get back on TV. LACEY: I don't know what you want me to say. You don't get a gig without me, got it? Okay, Kitty, I'm sorry. Um, I'm sorry, too. I shouldn't do coke with my other meds. Oh, fuck, come here, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I love you. I know. I love you, too. (WEEPING) Oh, Jesus, my face is gonna be all fucked up for tonight. I'ma fucking terrible person. It's okay. You'll have nothing to worry about soon. What? It'll all be over soon. What are you talking about? What will be over soon? (GUN BANGS) (DRAMATIC AMBIENT MUSIC) (GAGGING) I did it, I did it, I really fucked up, - I really fucked up! - You fucking moron! What did I tell you, no more impulses! That's the reason why I call the spots around here! HARVEY: I fucked up! You think? Now we need an alibi and get rid of a fucking body! The fuck did you two do? Okay, I can't be a part of any of this. I have a show tonight. We're all part of this now, you included. You wanna do coke and hang around my house, that's fine, but that makes you part of anything this family's gotta contend with, capiche? - I fucked up! - Shut the fuck up! Leave him alone, you bully. Hey, it's Hermann's house, Harvey's a fucking idiot. Sorry. I suggest waiting til nightfall, dump her in the woods. You know what, that's exactly what we're gonna do. Harvey, cancel your plans of doing nothing. You got a fucking hole to dig. And if you rat us out, I think you know what comes next. I'll bury you right fucking on top of her. I don't want any trouble. (GIGGLES) Good. She's my best friend, and I trust her. All right, I'm gonna go see if I can get some money form the Jew. HARVEY: Sounds like you could... I'm begging you, shut the fuck up! (HARVEY CRIES) Nobody touch the body, and that goes double for you. She's dead, no ropey, you degenerate fucking animal. (HARVEY CRIES) (GIGGLES) Harvey, you fucked up hard. (GIGGLES) HARVEY: Kitty, I fucked up! KITTY: Hermann isn't here to protect you. LACEY: Hey, yeah, I'm gonna go. Okay, good luck tonight, let me know how it goes. Thanks, I'll text you later, and good luck, yeah, good luck with all that. You know what happens now, right? HARVEY: No, no. Stand up, fatty. HARVEY: No, please, no. Stand up. No, Kitty, no. Oh, it's never enough. (SCREAMING) Dummy, fucking asshole! Stop, please, stop! This shames us all. You're gonna break my neck! Oh, you'd be lucky to get put down like that. (CRYING) Whoa, what the fuck? I didn't know you were fucking here. You, what the fuck, I got taken off the rope. I read the Dirt City, bro, I'm sorry. Whatever, it's all a big waste of time. Wait, hold on, do you not see the dead body? I see you with a gun. I see Harvey's bitch ass. Hey, Harvey. KITTY: It's all we got. Yeah, well, it's trash, and we're trash, and the whole thing is just washed up trash. - Hey! - What! Hermann killed a guy, and what the fuck did you two do to this chick? I don't even really care, I just, I just feel like we're all addicts with no careers, just like Otto before he blew his fucking brains out. Oh, stop with the fucking pity party. Dad was weak. I'm making it back to the spotlight. (LAUGHING) You're serious? You're serious? No, you're not. None of us are. We're all cursed. KITTY: Fuck off, pretty boy. Whatever. You got any drugs for me? None for you, you already sound like you're on pills. Yeah, I am. Whatever, there's probably some laying around somewhere, but fucking Hermann hoards them all for his frigging injuries. I got coke, but your heart could stop from the combo. MAN: Who gives a shit? Hermann might. MAN: And you? No, not really. You had your chance with a global company, millions of fans, and pissed it away. Yeah, well, so did you, sister. Piece of shit. Please, stop. No, you are still in the hot seat, mister! I have a gift for you, Karl. What? This. KARL: What the fuck am I supposed to do with this? Just, yours, do whatever you want with it. And you know where to buy pills. Go, live your life, it's the only one you got. (GIGGLES) KARL: Fuck you. No thanks. (GIGGLES) KARL: Harvey, sorry, bud. It looks like you're gonna have one hell of a mess to clean up. There is no salvation for you, Karl, only the void. Say what you will, Kitty, it is what it is. (GUN BANGS) (HARVEY WHIMPERS) It'll all be over soon. (PULSING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) TV ANNOUNCER: Professional wrestling is a disease. It hooks these kids at a young age, just like smack. Kids are prone to violence. Kids are looking for an escape. See, the truth is that they enjoy watching two men maim each other. The truth is their parents will allow them to watch this. The kids mimic the insanity in their everyday life. They use it as means to escape reality. When the TV goes off (SPEAKER DROWNED OUT). Shut up, Daddy, I'm trying to watch this. MAN: Boo! There you are. Tonight needs to be big. Really bust up the cleavage for the old drunks tonight. Gary, this really isn't appropriate. Those tattoos aren't appropriate if you ever wanna get signed to the big federation. These are not tattoos. I've earned them. I don't do this for a chance at money. Okay, my mistake, just work is stiff tonight. People love botches at indie events. You're new to wrestling and ringing. Jesus, now I know why you always wore the one-piece. Are you telling me to hurt her? Yeah, but you didn't hear that from me. Unlike the rest of you, I don't hurt others on purpose. I hold a higher calling. I don't know what you're on right now, but keep it up, I'm loving this. Wait, wait, wait, help, help! I'm gonna play you like a fucking fiddle! You should pay the boys to have your back, Gary. As a matter of fact, that's the reason why you're in the mess you're in right now. I'm gonna score big, I swear. Lacey here, she's gonna be a big hit. Lacey, why do you look like that? There's a lot you don't know about me, Hermann. I'm shocked. I'll talk to you later. But, as for you, you little rat bastard, I oughta kill you right here and right now. Look, your shoulders are too fucked up. You're no longer a big draw. What do you want me to do? Shut up, Gary. Listen, any money I make form tonight, just give it to the Von Strassers. - Why? - Just shut up and do it! It's time I pay you back for everything you've done. You can repay the favor later. Anything you need, Lacey. Just lay off the coke. (PHONE RINGS) Don't answer that phone. (PHONE RINGS) Don't answer that phone. I gotta get it. That's the locker room phone. Fuck you, I'm not done talking yet. I'm getting that phone. I don't care who it is, you touch that phone, I'll rip your guts out. I gotta do it. - Fuck you! - I have to. HERMAN: He's answering the fucking phone. Hello? Yes, I am. A first blood match? Tonight, what? Against Lacey? Okay, it's booked. Hurry up and get down here. Your audience awaits. Was that, uh, that better not be who I thought it was. Um, Lacey, I booked you, a huge main event, first blood. LACEY: Against who? Kitty Von Strasser. Goddamn it! You know what, I haven't got time for this. Next time I see you, I'm gonna rip your fucking face off, and, Lacey, I, oh, Jesus. Goddamn that was close, and no one tried to stop it. Why did you request that match? Cause all women hate each other. Fuck you, Gary! Why? It's a Von Strasser, take one fucking guess. Cause she wants to hurt me on purpose. Kid, I like you, I really do, but this might be your last night in the business. It's gonna be a night of barely legal matches as is. Great, I guess I better get ready for this. Maybe she wants to put you over, make you look good upon your debut. She wants me dead. I know. But this is gold, though, you know that, right? Did you do that to yourself? It's always been about survival, Gary. The Von Strassers took me in, they accepted me. I really don't wanna do this. But I'm willing to do what it takes to give the people what they want. Perfect, okay, I'm out. (DARK ELECTRONIC MUSIC) It'll be a new scar for you, Kitty. (DARK ELECTRONIC MUSIC) All the beauty must die. (DARK ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (MUSIC BOX TINKLES) (HARVEY CRYING) Jesus fucking Christ, you couldn't fucking stop him? Where the fuck's my sister? (HARVEY CRIES) When we get back, you're cleaning up this mess. (HARVEY CRIES) Get a fucking shovel, we gotta ditch this fucking corpse! (HARVEY CRIES) RADIO ANNOUNCER: My faithful listeners, welcome to the year 2033. Prepare for the end. Stock your bunkers with hookers and blow, the end times are upon us. Welcome to a future ruled by the dark, the dark. And now, for some brand new post-punk synth. (DARK ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Do I really have to dig? My asthma's killing me. You know, I've seriously had enough of you for one fucking day. Start digging along the woods. Wouldn't you rather me go deeper into the woods? It's a swamp. Even though I'd love to see you fall in and die a slow, agonizing death. You're digging. HARVEY: Oh, okay. Don't worry, I'll carry her down by myself. Fat, ignorant fuck. (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) For God's sakes, I'm the one that carried her down here. Fucking work. HARVEY: My asthma's acting up! You're gonna eat that fucking shovel in about two seconds, let's go. (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) (PULSING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (GASPING) (GAGGING) (PULSING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Jesus! (PULSING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) CREATURE: You will deliver more innocence. What are you? Innocence? How are you doing that? I can hear you, you're in my head. CREATURE: Purity and innocence. You want sacrifices? CREATURE: Blood and essence and beauty. I could do that. But what can you give me? CREATURE: You may continue to feed from them. You possess a heart of darkness. You are the one to destroy purity, destroy all beauty. - I... - You will gain the power that you seek. I will gain the power that I seek. CREATURE: Go forth in the night, deadly. What happened to the chick? I know she was dead when I brought her here. CREATURE: Pay no mind to it. It was never born. I don't understand. CREATURE: You don't have to. You have a name? CREATURE: Business has never been essential. You want blood? I live for blood. I don't know who or what you are, but I'll give you what you want. I feel compelled. CREATURE: Excellent. Now, go forth. Damn it! Did you see that thing? HARVEY: What thing? I gotta start a crusade. HARVEY: A crusade for what? To smother out all natural beauty. Karl was weak, he was a failure. He was our last chance to get any place in the world, but he failed, just like Dad. So we're gonna take back what's rightfully ours. You know all those beautiful beaches that we'll never lay on? Yeah. Let's cover them with oil. All those beautiful girls that we'll never fuck without paying? Let's slit their fucking throats. Let's find the most beautiful family with the most unconditional love and crush them and pulverize them, just like we are. I'll do anything for you, brother. HERMANN: Are you gonna follow me to the gates of hell? I'll follow you fucking anywhere! Good, cause you're about to. Why the fuck go to hell when we can fucking bring it here?

(LAUGHING) Oh, shit! (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GUN BANGS) (SCREAMING) (CROWD CHEERS AND CLAPS) She did what? Aw, you gotta be shitting me! Can they reattach it? Fuck! Your sister cut my fucking nipple off. I heard. I'm sorry, she's a fucking disgrace. We think she killed Karl, too. I'm not here for your sympathy. I've been through hell and back. My father was nuts and I'm fucking nuts. I'm bred on violence. I'm sorry, Lacey. No need to be sorry. I want more. I wanna fulfill my destiny. What destiny? These scars, I cut these scars into my own flesh every time I wanted to sink the blade into someone else. Yeah, well, I think we can help you with that. We found a thing. A thing? You found a thing? I don't want anymore drugs. Something better than drugs? What's better than drugs, Hermann? A monster in the woods, I think he came form the swamp. Told us we had a higher calling. Wait, a higher calling? Wait, wait, you guys saw it, too? Wait. Explain that. When I was younger, my father, he used to ramble on about God's abortion, revolutionary war crimes, the murdered souls of Native Americans, genocide. Something in the swamp manifested, like, an energy. Wait, wait, I read about something like this online. HERMANN: No shit? Yeah, uh, it was a ghost hunter's blog. Who are you shitting? Everybody knows you can't read. And, besides, you do know all that shit's fake, right? No, it's exactly what you're talking about. They talked about the genocides and all the murders. Yeah, I mean, there's been so many people that have gone down there and just never come back, lured by bright lights. It's been collecting souls. No shit? I wonder if those satanic sacrifices took place in the woods. That cult they found dead, my father, when he was the sheriff, it was the only job he ever took seriously, he lost his hand that night, the night of the massacre, fuck. That was 12 years ago. So many crimes. War, genocide, murder. The negative energy must be intense. It makes sense. What I saw was fucking real, and it was gorgeous. I was never more happy than when it spoke to me. I don't know what else to say, besides it was never born. It was created from misery and death in the swamp. 100 years of pain. It's not gonna stop. And what it wants, I want. Do you really? Do you know what it's end game is? Does it matter? LACEY: I guess not. Nothing is worse than what I've already been through. All those souls. It's been getting stronger. I just wish we know what it wanted. I have this really weird feeling this is a lot worse than we think, that everything is somehow connected. We need your help. LACEY: I'm still listening. There's no place left for this family to go, for you, me, any of us. There's nothing left to give. Everybody needs a crutch. Do you know what I mean? LACEY: Yeah, I do. Be it love, marriage, passion, whatever. I gave my life to professional wrestling. I destroyed my body, pulverized my brain. I can't remember where I've been, who I've seen, who I've loved, who I've hurt. I can't walk up a set of stairs without being in pain. And for what? A bunch of jag-offs who don't remember or don't care. All they can do is look at their phones like a bunch of mindless drones. LACEY: Mindless drones. Now it's time to make one last sacrifice, to make that one last suicidal plunge, to storm the cockpit and drive that 747 directly into the ground, to do that diving headbutt into the face of normalcy, knocking out its rotten teeth. Whatever humanity calls beauty and warmth, I wanna blot it out. I wanna extinguish the sun. I wanna cause a new day of death, darkness, and destruction, where I am the world's Heavyweight Champion once again! You always did cut the best promos, Hermann. You deserve the best. We all do. I'm in. Whatever that thing is, we belong to it now. First off, we need a plan. The bodies are already starting to pile up. The cops are going to be on to us. We can use you as bait. Bait? I'm a fucking walking corpse. What are you talking about? You're beautiful. And, besides, we don't have to be picky, and when the time is right, I'll crush their skulls. And I'll dig the graves. All right. One thing we have to deal with, that cop Harvey killed, she's not dead. I have a really bad feeling about her. Yes, we know. Well, fuck her, we'll kill her again. But what's up with that chick? Where'd she come from? I have no idea. We just have to get rid of her as quickly as possible. All we have is each other now. Let's take the plunge. (QUIET ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Oh, a shotgun blast. Wrestling. Haven't seen that since yesterday. (SOFT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) She's hardcore. She's hardcore. (MACHINERY BEEPS) (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) (FLIES BUZZING) (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) (GRUNTING) (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) (WOOD CHIPPER RUMBLES) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kill you the first time. It's just that you came back to life and, well, we just have to be careful. You saw me die? You weren't breathing. Is this a dream? I don't think so. Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this? To kill you. I kind of fucking figured that out! People like you murdered my family. We didn't do shit! I just stuck a fork in you and you came back to life! People like you deserve to die! What is your problem, lady? I wish I knew. I don't remember anything else. Okay, but you gotta die for real this time. Fuck you, retard! Oh, just make it easy! You piece of shit. Why won't you just be a good girl and just die? I can still feel pain. That's the idea. (WHIMPERING) (GRUNTING) Oh, shit. Wait, it's not my fault. It was all Hermann's idea. All he wanted to do was feed the demon in the woods. What demon? I don't know, I didn't see it. You tried feeding me to it? No, no, you just got in the way. But we can work together. We can do great things. What great things? Higher purpose, all your pain, it will disappear. What did you just say to me? You can find salvation. There is no salvation. Fuck you and fuck your family and fuck your demon. I don't even know what I'm doing! Fuck you, bitch! You could've had it all! It's more merciful when a creature like you just dies. (HARVEY WHIMPERS) (SCREAMING) (HARVEY CRYING) (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) (SCREAMING) (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) (THUMPING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Hey. I've never had a date like you before. Yeah, I'm sorry, Mike, I won't be here for very long. I'm sorry to hear that. That's really sad. Yeah, whatever. I've come to terms with it. And you're here to party one last time? Yeah, that's it. You better not be like all the other guys I've met on Tinder. MIKE: You go on there often? Don't judge, man, you have a profile. MIKE: No, no, no, no, no, I'm not judging. You know, this is just my first time. - Your first time fucking? - MIKE: No, no, my first time where I didn't even know the chick's name. It's not important. You horny? Are you a man? Yes. Then let's go. MIKE: So, like, how many times have you used it? LACEY: Three today. MIKE: No, really? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, man, just for you. I really liked your pictures. MIKE: Aw, sweet, thank you. Yeah, I liked yours, too. Yeah. What do you got over here? MIKE: That's my ADD medication. LACEY: Can I crush some up and snort it? MIKE: Uh, I don't know. It's not like it's gonna kill me. Yeah, that's true. Um, yeah, do what you gotta do, that's fine, that's fine. Fuck me. MIKE: I will, I will, I will. Don't tell me you're not gonna do this. No, I'm just not used to how fast this going, that's all. Uh, I don't have a condom. Hurry up, just put it in. Okay, all right, I'm sorry, I'm just nervous. Whatever. (GENTLE GRUNTING) Sorry, that doesn't usually happen. Yep, third time today. Wait, what? Don't worry, even if I had something, you won't be around long enough to suffer from it. What the fuck are you talking about? (PULSING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Surprise. Pull up your pants. I've gotta bring this little cocksucker to the woods myself. I can't find Harvey, he's not answering his texts. You think everything's all right? Who the fuck knows? He always disappears when there's work to be done. Nice job, Lacey. Thanks. Next time, could you be a little faster? None of these guys are worth fucking. I promise, I'll be faster. And thank you for your sacrifice. What if we get caught? If we get caught, we do as we always do, we go down swinging. All right, we're gonna have to move faster. Agreed. Come on, Neil Dickfuckfucker. You and I are going on a road trip. Oh. Are you still breathing? LACEY: Uh huh. Here, have one of those. It'll make you feel better. Come on, sonny boy. (FUNEREAL ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (WHITE NOISE HISSES) My. (BEEPING) Who are you? I don't know who I am. I can only tell you how I feel and why I'm compelled to do what I've been doing. Why are you here? I've been hearing about you for a long time. My writings? You're a religion professor, right? PROFESSOR: Yeah. And hippy new age expert on energy? Sure, I guess you could sort of say that. Tell me what I am and I'll leave. You never have to see me again. Although I feel a great deal of light and pain emanating from you, you're gonna have to give me something to go on. I can't be killed. I question my own mortality. I question whether my memories are my memories. I think it's safe to say you're not a lady of Padama, but, rather, someone who broke into my home and place of business. I don't see why the hell I should help you. But I also feel compelled. Why I feel this energy, does it have to do with what emanates from the swamp? The swamp stories. I have felt a great deal of evil and perhaps pain, the same pain that you feel in visiting the area. It might be easier if you just tell me what you're thinking. It's all I can remember. Memories of my family, working my job as a probation officer in this town. The only proof I have are newspaper clippings, except the satanic cult who murdered them, along with others in that fucking swamp. It's possible those are the memories of the collective, everyone who has lost someone because of the evil that that swamp has created, like a death magnet simply drawing dark forces to it. And, over time, the darkness took the form of a creature, a presence became something more, feeding, constantly feeding. It's real? The demon's real? I don't know about that. I can feel it. It lingers in the air. Listen, be careful. If everything I've read and everything you're telling me is true, it's gaining power and will soon be able to travel outside of its realm and, of course, influence humans. I've seen the latter. What am I? Impossible to say. You look human, but your energy doesn't feel human. And, since all energy can't be created or destroyed, you're... What am I? Who am I? You may be the polar energy of the demon you speak of. Its opposite. The memories of the heartbroken and dead linger within your soul. Do I have a weakness? You've been dead you say? I think so, couple of times. Then your soul would have to be ripped from your body. What's the end game for the demon? When it's all done, what does it want? I don't know. Let's just start with this, you're it's opposite, so whatever works for you, will not work for it. Does technology malfunction around you? I don't think so. We're all connected by energy, somehow, some way. I've noticed a shift in electrical energy since moving here and opening up the shop, like something is changing the current of any device, wifi signal, any phone I come across. I'd have to travel to the swamp to accurately tell you if that's the source. It's going to black out the world. I don't think any one thing has that kind of power. It would have to find a way to transfer its energy, like a giant transmitter. It's just not something to worry about. The best it could do is spread more death. Not that we want that. I have a book I'd like you to read. I'm gonna grab it. You might wanna use the doorbell next time. Wait, you didn't teleport in here, did you? No. The front door was unlocked. Odds are, I'm assisting some escaped mental patient. Come on, Lydia, get a life. (WHITE NOISE HISSES) (GROANING) (WHITE NOISE DRONES) (DRAMATIC AMBIENT MUSIC) (PLAYFUL ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) (SCREAMING) Got you, bitch! Get off me, you psycho! Miss me, besty? LACEY: Get your hands off me! You think I don't know what comes next, but I do! Yeah, you're wrestling career is over, even if you weren't blackballed again. You're a coke whore! And you don't have a hand. You need your hand to grapple. Who are you to take that away from me? How dare you to take that from me! I didn't take anything from you! You did this to yourself! All because you didn't wanna see me take your spot. You are never taking my spot, never! You just got in the way, fucked things up for the real talent. I've wrestled all over the world and you're nothing but a little whore. I can smell the cum on you, whore. What are you up to? LACEY: Stop, wait, Kitty, I'll tell you. Oh, you are in my brother's pain pills again, aren't you? I'm just a fucking rat! He always loved you more than me! We found a higher calling. Hermann's on his way to the woods right now with a sacrifice. What, what? Are you all out of your fucking minds? We serve him, loyal to the last breath. Loyal to what? I don't have the strength but it'll be okay, and now I'm gonna do it for myself! (SCREAMING AND GRUNTING) You don't have the heart, darling. Your destiny was to be my little bitch. Now, I'm gonna show you exactly what I mean by that. Get wet for me, whore. (GAGGING AND COUGHING) (PANTING) (BUZZING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (KITTY GIGGLES) If you have ever found Jesus, now is the time to pray. (LAUGHS) (DRAMATIC PERCUSSION) Finally! (LAUGHS) (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) I hate this business, I hate this family, I hate everything in this fucking world! (SCREAMING) (DRONING AMBIENT MUSIC) She's hardcore, she's hardcore, she's hardcore, she's hardcore, she's hardcore! (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (DRONING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) ANNOUNCER: So a small part of the US is still experiencing blow outs. Still getting a lot of (SPEAKER DROWNED OUT BY BUZZING). I think it's some kind of conspiracy, some kind of government testing. Call me paranoid, but this isn't normal. We're losing our electricity (SPEAKER CUT OFF). Who's the skank? Huh, what skank? Hermann? Paying the boys off with sex now, Gary? Hey, I don't think they want a piece of my ass as far as I know. Well, that all depends on how you do tonight. Oh, Christ, Hermann, the cops are all over me. I'm fucking ruined. I've lost my insurance and, between you and your sister, I'll never work again. You do a job for me tonight and we're even. GARY: Even Steven? Yeah, that's right. Dare I ask? And, also, I could just file for bankruptcy, and you can suck on a lemon. I guess I can put the car in park, turn it off, exit the vehicle, and walk up to your office door and kick it in. Then I'd throw you down on the ground, rip both your eyeballs out, make you eat one, I'd eat the other, and then the real beating would commence, and then once I got tired or bored, whichever came first, I'd kill you, right then and there, right here and now. Fuck, you're outside. Get out here and get in my car, Gary. GARY: What's this job? I need a little manual labor. My shoulder's frozen, my back's out. No, no way. - Is this to bury a body? - Yeah. But just think about it, you do this for me, and we're even. Hell, if it goes south and we get arrested, I'll even testify on your behalf. All you gotta do is dig. You'd be a character witness for me? Sure. Me, Harvey, and the rest of the gang, we'll be your character references. Fine, I'll do it. Then that's it. We're square. Agreed. Now get your ass out here. (CRICKETS CHIRP) Gary, long time no see. Please, just please don't make this worse for me. I wouldn't dream of it. By the way, you got any pills? That shit'll kill you. Come on, I need something that won't mix with the juice. My stomach's been really sensitive. GARY: I'm not a pharmacist. Okay, okay, I'll call a guy I know, but you mix that shit and it could kill you for real. It's all right. I don't need to be breathing much longer. Oh fuck, fuck me, that's the type of crazy shit I was afraid of hearing. You like this music? Look, look forward. (DRONING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) You say one more fucking word, I'm gonna slap the shit out of you. Start digging, shovels are in the back. Oh, great, who the fuck is this? Stay here. Don't talk to any voices. GARY: Voices? I don't care, Hermann. I don't give a fuck why you're out here. Did you kill Karl and Harvey? Karl did himself in. Not that he had any use. You could've stopped him. He was weak. Wasn't that always your thing? Kill the weak, divide and conquer. Now look at us, look at the family. So? So what? So finish answering the fucking question. Did you kill Harvey? No, but someone else did. (GIGGLES) You're so gonna hate me, though. I put an end to your little pet Lacey. You what? Oh yeah, she's gone, and it wasn't quick. You little fucking witch. I really liked her. How could you? Hermann, what are you doing out here? What have you gotten yourself into? And you're questioning me and what I'm doing? At least I'm still in fucking reality. Why is your stomach bleeding? KITTY: I'm burning up. I feel cold, Hermann. It's okay. You're gonna die here with me. With us. This really is the end of everything pure, just like we always talked about. Talked about when, in our wrestling promos? That was fake, Hermann, a script. It was real! My sacrifice, my pain, my scars, it was all real. And now look at us, being blackballed. Come with me. We can black out the sun together. All I ever wanted was to get back on TV, that's it. You really don't see the big picture, do you, Kitty? You're really disappointing me. You are gone. I don't even know who or what it is I'm talking to anymore. Just go, go with your new god. But don't you wanna black out the sun? Don't you wanna see God, mother nature, the universe, whatever it is, for all its natural beauty, to die, to be broken and pulverized like us? I don't care anymore. Just let me die in peace. But, because I love you, I brought you a present. What? Backseat. You brought my stick, the barbwire stick. I love you, too, Kitty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of my car and go do what you gotta do. Where you going? (GIGGLES) Oh, I'm not dead yet. I have unfinished business with the bitch that took my hand. She's not human. You gotta stop her from coming here. Yeah, I hear she can't die. But she can be maimed, and I'm gonna cut her into pieces, and then you can finish whatever the fuck it is you're doing out there. Thank you, Kitty. (LAUGHING) Oh, yeah, whatever the fuck else could family be for? Just do me a favor. What? Kill Gary. Just don't let that motherfucker live. Yeah, I never liked Gary. What are big brothers for? Consider it done. Okay, get the fuck out of my car. You tried to run on me, you vile piece of shit! I'll fucking cut you fucking deeper, make sure you die fucking slow. You tried to run on me? Are you working tonight or what? Get the fuck out here! I'll fucking cut you deep and make sure you die very slow. I don't like you, I don't like you, and I really don't fucking like you. You understand what I'm fucking saying? Yeah, yes. You're more worthless than my fucking brother. Get over here. (CREEPY AMBIENT MUSIC) Dig. Dig. Dig faster. (SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I don't wanna hear German right now. Hey, pal, I can see things moving in between the trees. Dig. I need a place to bury these pigs. GARY: Oh God. You men are the lucky ones. You have been brought here tonight to witness the dawn of a new world. Lacey gave her life in sacrifice for this to happen, and I'll be damned if any of you maggots run, try to escape, and ruin it for us. Get back here! Come here! You're all right, you're all right. (BONES CRACK) You better not have fucking run! The rest of you have the option to die on your feet. Face the swamp! This is the part where the commanding officer says future generations will thank you. But no one will ever know of your sacrifice, men, because this is our war, and our war alone! Are you quoting your Japanese death match speech? Shut the fuck up! Yeah, sorry, sorry. Men, you have reached your salvation. (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (SQUISHING) (PULSING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) What the fuck? CREATURE: You have done well. So close. One more soul, one more. Any will do. Return to power draws near. Required is one more death, pure, beautiful. I don't know what the fuck is going on. CREATURE: Clean. Bring me the blood of an unborn child. What about him? What, fuck you, Hermann, fuck you! This is straight-up fucking insanity! I can feel your power. (GROANING) CREATURE: Yes. Soon, leave this place, amongst the stars. What then? CREATURE: Wait, and witness the end. Carry out my final order. Bring back blood without sin. Whatever you ask, my beautiful, beautiful master. (CHIMING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) = Who am I? Don't know. Does it matter? I'd like to know why I am here on this planet. Nowhere else to go. My memories aren't my own. Do you know what it's like to feel something all the time, to hear their voices without end? Don't care, lady. I don't know what you are. I don't know what you have inside you that keeps that flesh from rotting. Why are you so cruel? There's nothing else to be. And I'm cruel? You destroyed our entire family. If that's what you want to call it, a family. It was filth. I'm going to tear you to pieces. And not because I care about my brother or his plan, but because I know how much you wanna love, how much you wanna be human, and I wanna take that away from you. Do you believe in hell? KITTY: No. I can feel it burn. It's not fire. It's an absence of love, void of emotions. death from within. I'm already dead. I have no family, no career. Just pain that I'm about to extend to whatever the fuck it is that you are. Then I have no choice but to put you out of your misery. Well, don't see your shotgun. Bet you don't last long without it. Realized I didn't need it. It's not about what I do, but how I feel. What the fuck does that mean? That thing in the woods, it's going to take control of the world. I can feel its pain, and only I can counterbalance that with love and mercy. Take control of the world? It will become powerful enough tonight to transcend the atmosphere, to transform into pure energy, make its way to your satellites. It will take control of the weak-minded and turn your own communications against you and unleash a plague the world has never seen. Jesus Christ, so that thing is real? It's real, and if you disable my brain, I won't be able to slow it down. Humanity has always been threatened. World wars, corrupt politicians, ancient demons, giant meteors. Who gives a shit? A disease like the human race will always find a new host to feed off of. It's herpes, and it's never going away. There is still good in the world. Yeah, it's all trapped inside your head, lady. Oh, fuck. Fuck, I should've thought of that. Damn it! Damn it! All I ever wanted was to be the best. (WEEPING) It's okay. It'll all be over soon. What? What did you just say to me? Nothing.
