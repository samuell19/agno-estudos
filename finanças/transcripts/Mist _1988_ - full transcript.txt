Fog # Here is a special bulletin from the military. # The military has taken over the government to preserve democracy. Murat! Get up, brother. - What's going on? - Look. [Istanbul 1960] What's going on? It's not even morning yet. There's been a military coup, mother. The army has taken over. I hope it's for the best. May God protect our nation from being destroyed. So that's why your father didn't come home last night. He couldn't tell us, could he? Well, I hope it's for the best. I'll make some tea. Hello, father! Is that you? Yes, we're all fine. Of course I heard. How could one possibly not hear about a military takeover? What did you say? Don't worry. We're all fine. Mother is fine, and so are the kids. My elder brother's very happy. Don't worry, my own feelings are not important right now. No father, I'm not overjoyed like he is. All right, father. Here's my elder brother. Good morning, father. - He's your father after all. - Mother please stay out of this. I might as well go and say my prayer. All right, father. Try to be home for breakfast. Very well. He'll come as soon as he can. Everything's under control apparently. Why did you speak to father like that? Must I speak differently to the Colonel just because of the coup? - That colonel is your father. - Fine. I didn't say anything. What am I supposed to say? You can't expect me to rejoice because of this coup! You'll see. It'll start now: secret organizations, executions. Things like that always happen with military coups. In fact you'll be the one who's going to see. If you hadn't given up your dream of going to France you would have understood your country better. This country is unlike any other country. I'm going to get dressed. Stop acting the French intellectual. Don't worry. The nation will find out what's best. Is your father at home, Murat? Father, the neighbours from below are here. - Which neighbours? -The ones with the store. Father, Keriman says the grocer is giving out free sodas. Is that true? Let me get dressed, boys. Welcome. Let's hope it'll be auspicious. Thank God that we live to see these days. What's the meaning of all this? - Very true. - Let me tell you ... Why do you keep watching the street, Keriman? - Would you help me? - I swear I will. Come on, tell me. Hearing about the coup I became so exhilarated I made a vow that I'd kiss the first person I'll see this morning. Shame on you! What if it's a man? But I've already made the vow, auntie. I wish I hadn't. But I got so exited when I heard the marches. I hope our men won't notice. Someone's coming. I shall be ruined. We'll be put to shame before the whole neighbourhood. Come on, don't act like a whore. But I made a vow. God would punish me! I'll just tell him that he's now my brother for life, that I've made a vow because of the coup. Nobody's looking right now. Run outside and come back before anyone sees you. # We shall respect all our pacts. # We shall remain faithful to NATO and CENTO. # Our wish is for peace on earth. Is your father in, sonny? Who is it, Erol? Do you remember me, judge? Of course. I saw you in court yesterday. God bless you. God bless you for being such a fair judge. You acquitted me yesterday. May everything you touch turn to gold. - I only followed the law. - Thank you, sir. - Don't thank me. You were acquitted for lack of evidence. Judge, accept a small gift. We caught them this morning. They're fresh. Take them away. I don't even want to here of it. But judge, it's only fish! How dare you! - Are you trying to bribe me? - Not at all, judge. How can some fish be a bribe! Enjoy them tonight for dinner. Take them away! All right, sir, don't get angry. Very well. I'm going to pretend this hasn't happened. But bear in mind that a civil servant never accepts bribes. No civil servant would ever lower himself in such a way. For goodness sake, don't exaggerate. It's just a few fishes. I'll just buy them to save you all the trouble. Come with me. How much do you want for them? What cheek! [Istanbul 1978] Will they demolish our house at once? But we still have a year to move out, haven't we? - Let's hope so. - I'll get it, mother. Come in, son, just in time for dinner. Father! Something's happened. What's the matter, my son? They've shot Murat. - Who did it? - They fired from the street. I'm the District Attorney on duty. My condolences. I have to ask some questions. - Was your son living alone here, Ali Bey? - No. We rented this place because it was closer to the University. We live on the Asian side. Come here. - Did you see it happen? - Yes. We were talking. Murat was going out to meet Idil. - Who's Idil? - His fianc?e. She's from the same faculty. The window was open. I heard a shot. I threw myself on the floor. When I looked up... I rushed home to tell my father. - So you didn't phone right away? - There's no phone here. District Attorney, we found this in the garbage, two blocks away. Have you seen this before? No. I gave you mother a tranquilizer. Do you want one too? We thought it couldn't happen to us. But it did. At this rate there won't be a single family left unaffected. I heard on the radio that they shot from the street? Yes. As usual, unidentified youngsters. Father, I must ask you something. Do you still have the gun? - What gun? - The one they gave you in Korea. It's probably in its place. A gun's useless against people you don't know, my boy. If we ever found them, I'd help you anyway. Nevertheless, would you please check. I can't remember where I put it. Why do you ask for it? - I want to make sure it hasn't been stolen. - Ok. Tell me what's going on. I don't know, I just don't. - Have you found out anything? - The autopsy report has come in now. But there still seem to be some unanswered questions. - Tell the judge that I'll be there in a minute. - Very well, sir. Did you know your son was involved with a certain organization? He had been arrested before. He was politically active, but... Did you know that both brothers were involved with opposing movements? Erol has nothing to do with politics. The coroner doesn't believe the bullet was fired from the street. If so, the bullet would have had to travel upwards. But this doesn't fil the wound. It looks like the bullet entered straight. It could have been fired from a vehicle. Or from the building across the street. Anything's possible these days. Two years ago, you retired as a judge because you no longer wanted to deal with cases like this, remember? Do we have a chance of catching the killer? Look Ali, we're old friends. There's something fishy about this case. Like what? Again, I may be mistaken. You know, we're under Martial Law right now. Only family members are allowed at the funeral in order to avoid demonstrations. I know. Put your jacket on. We're going out. Wait for me here. This is the house of one of my clients. You can stay here for a while. The island's deserted this time of the year. I'll be back. Here're the keys. Don't turn the lights on, it may draw attention. Welcome back, Ali. - Where's Erol? - In a safe place, mother. I'd rather have him here with me. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there. You've got to protect yourself. Hang 50 people, that would solve the problem. But that would mean civil war. War is war. If you hadn't been so crazy to let the two kids move into that apartment, I could have protected them both. Because we're a long way from the University? So what! Father, did you find the gun? I've talked to the landlord, he'll take the rest. But there's a problem. Most of these books might be banned. We can't leave them here, nor take them with us. I'll take them home and burn them. Would you? Be careful, don't get caught. No one will suspect me. I'm not involved in anything. One never knows. I'll drive you home, it's safer. Give Erol my love and tell him to be careful. Call me if you need something. I wanted to come to the funeral, but you don't want to be seen with me. No one knows about us yet. - They'll know when we get married. - Please, don't start that now. You're so tense and bottled up, it'll only make everything worse. What do you expect me to do? I don't know. Cry or scream. Say something! I just don't understand it. I just don't understand what's happening to us. - Then try to understand. The pain because your son ... - Suzan, please stop it! - Why? - Everything is such a mess. How can I grieve for one if I haven't yet saved the other? Why should you have to save your other son? Don't try to resist. You'll get out when I tell you to. You know who murdered your son you buried today. Don't you? As Murat's father, you're our friend. But as Erol's father, you're our enemy. We shall punish Erol. And you know why. You're lying! Don't try to save the murderer, it's no use, Mr. Lawyer. Or Mr. Judge. It'll only be worse for you, too. Erol's sentence is final. Father! What are you doing here? - I'm watching you, son. - Father, they've seen me. Twice. Who saw you? I don't know. But there are some men on the island. Hello, Seyid Efendi. We're going up to the office. Give me the keys. You wait for me downstairs, Seyid. I'll be back in a minute. Be very careful. You can trust Seyit Efendi. Don't go out at all. I'll keep you informed. Good morning, father. What are you up to? This place looks like a workshop. None of your business! This radio is ten times better than that modern junk. It's about time we took some measures. Those civilians have ruined us all. What are the civilians supposed to do? Life has become too cheap. People are being killed daily. We've lost a strapping grandson. I could snuff this out in one day. In one single day! All you have to do is hang 100 of them in Taksim square. It looks like things are heading that way anyway. - My condolences. - Don't let anyone in. And don't answer the phone. Very well. Idil, this is Ali. I must see you at once. No, it's not about the books. I'll give you an address, it's near your place. Acacia apartments, no. 12. You'll get there first. Ask for Suzan. She knows about you. Kamil? Yes it's me. Can you look up an old file for me? The accused's name was Osman Suzer. I need his address. It was in the 1960s. I'll call you back presently. Thanks. Miss, we come here all the time, please let us in. Ali Bey, we wanted to talk to you, but your secretary didn't let us in. What do you want to talk about? We're interviewing parents whose children were murdered, for our new "Broken Hearts" article series. Leave me alone. Let me show you some photos. This article series will be fantastic. Wait a second. Please, gentlemen! - Look at me. - Please, gentlemen! Please, gentlemen! Good-bye. Look. What a huge ship is passing. It looks like a big whale. Like a pitchblack whale. But bigger than a whale, right? Bigger. - Ships are bigger than whales. - And they don't spout water. You'll have to pull yourself together. There's no other way. It will get easier as time passes. I'm all right. I understand. - I've heard she takes men in at night. - Anyway, they say she's a feminist. - What's that? - A sort of prostitute. Idil, we're a tough spot. They're after Erol. Maybe it's the same organization. They're following me too. I've hidden Erol in the office of a friend of mine who's away in London for medical treatment. I'm looking after his affairs. Only the janitor knows, but he's all right, a honest country boy. Suzan is no stranger, I was her divorce lawyer. I'll give you the address now. Bring him some food and act as go-between. - Don't worry. I'll go right away. - Only we mustn't meet anymore. Well keep in touch by phone. Be careful. ok? Take it. Good bye. What a pretty girl. - You know, don't you, Suzan? - What? Marriage ... talking about this incident ... We have more important things to talk about right now. - Who is it? - Idil. You? Hello. So this is where you're staying. I've brought you some food. And two shirts. You father sends his regards. Apparently they're following him, too. That's why he couldn't come. But no one will suspect me. I can come every day. This picture... Are you going to keep this? I don't know. Your father said he trusts the janitor, but that man is weird. I don't like him. Stay a bit longer. All right. I think I'd better go now. If the young Miss wants to leave, I'll have to open the door for her. The building's all locked up. Don't be afraid. Remind Ali Bey not to forget his friends. Father? You? Is there anything you want to tell me? Father? Well ... are you hiding something from me? Father, what do you mean? You hit Murat the same way once too. And when you hit him you said, things like that happen in Latin America. Things like that may happen in Latin America. There's no torture in our country. There is! So you're saying there isn't? - But there is! There is! - There isn't! I'm telling you! May God punish you! We don't beat people up here. You said it was an accident, wasn't it? It was an accident, wasn't it? It was an accident, wasn't it? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Don't worry, it'll go out soon. What if someone saw it? Someone will either see us or him, Ali Bey. What do you mean? He's got everything. A woman, food, drinks. We're the ones who eat shit, Ali Bey. And what has he got that I haven't? Weren't we both born after 9 months? How much do you want? I'll leave that to your discretion. Good morning. - Aleyk?m selam. - Selam?n aleyk?m. I'm looking for a friend of mine. He's a skipper too. Osman Reis. Do you know him? - I know him. - Where can I find him? I haven't seen him for years. I don't know where he's now. Fellow countryman! His cousin Hidayet works as a waiter in the Grand Hotel. - He might know his whereabouts. - Thank you. Any calls? -The District Attorney. He said it's urgent. He wants you to call him. - Hello? - You called me. What's going on? Good morning, Ali. I've got news. We've caught the killer. Which killer? Murat's killer of course. Who was it? He's committed four other murders. We've been looking for him for a while. He was caught by chance. I'll be right over. He was seen in the street outside at the time of the murder. He's 19. H?seyin Alt?n. He's killed four already. - 19 and already four murders? - With Murat that makes five. He doesn't feel guilty at all. He doesn't care about getting hung, either. He grew up in a squatter area. Peasants who moved to Istanbul. - Can I see him? I want to be sure. - If you like, we'll go together. - Before I forget, your father called. - My father? What did he want? He wants to see Murat's file. There are loopholes in the case. He wants to check them himself. We'd like to ask you a few questions, H?seyin. Ask all you want. You killed all those men in cold blood, so many ... - I did them all in. -All right, but why? They were all enemies of the nation. All rich communists. Rich communists? A journalist, two retired teachers, a doctor and a student? - What student? -Your last murder. Murat F?rat. You're trying to pin everything on me! H?seyin, is your family in Istanbul? - Yes. - Where do they live? Near the Byzantian walls. Who are you? Murat's father, a lawyer. They'll hang me anyway, right? Go ahead, blame me for everything. I've killed four dogs, and I'll kill more. I'm going to escape and kill you all. Wait a minute! Is there no dress code in this prison? Cut off his moustache. Don't cut it off! You can't do that... Please don't cut it off. Don't do it! You see. He doesn't feel a thing. And he went drinking with his buddies after the murder. He's a ghettto kid. I wonder if he's really Murat's murderer? Even if he hadn't killed Murat he's guilty anyway. The murderer of four people is surely bound to kill again. If he had a clean record wouldn't it be harder to convict him? No, it would be easier. It's more difficult now. Think, Ali. Nothing could affect the killer's sentence now. But Erol's situation will be cleared, for you and your father. It'll only be legally cleared. But the organization won't give up on him. And we could never be sure, in our conscience. I think you're wrong. The truth is probably simpler. - Erol just can't talk. - Why not? Maybe there's something he can't tell you. Maybe there are some darker aspects, nothing like what you're imagining, some secrets, he can't talk. Do you really believe that? From the start I believed that there were others involved. But Erol can't tell you about it. If I could just be convinced of this murderer's guilt. Maybe his family could give you an a clue? - Who are you looking for? - Where does H?seyin live? - Which H?seyin? - H?seyin Alt?n. - Why are you looking for him? - I'm a lawyer. I want to see his family. Can I see your ID? Take him to them. Mother, this man's a lawyer. He's here about my brother. What does he want? H?seyin's going to face trial. His case looks bad. To hell with him. I hope they hang him soon! Killing a man instead of working and looking after the family! His father's been bedridden for five years. This dog's just like him anyway. Are you going to defend him in court? Maybe. I'm just trying to get some facts right now. Did you know that H?sein is charged with killing five men? I know. A nice oily noose would fit his neck perfectly. Shut up, woman. Don't pay any attention to her, sir. She's just talking to herself. Her mind's confused. Are you defending him for free? Because we don't have any money. H?seyin used to get money from other people but never gave us any. How do you get by? Mother does some house cleaning. I pick up whatever jobs I can find. We had 13 kids. But most of them died. H?seyin's elder brother died as a baby. H?seyin got his birth certificate. Did you know what H?seyin was up to? No. He'd stopped coming home. He was always out with his shitty friends. The cops were looking for him. He couldn't come here anyway. - Can you arrange for me to see him? - Maybe. Is he still so skinny? Good evening. Listen, Erdo?an. Wait a sec. Erdo?an, I've got some questions about your elder brother, wait a sec. How are you today? - Who was that? - Who? Who was that? Don't worry. He doesn't know anything. - I asked you who that was? - Not a stranger, just my cousin. He was coming this way. Don't worry. I've been very careful. A cousin! Why are you so angry? When Murat saw us together, he didn't react this way. He's my cousin, I'm telling you. We grew up together. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Can I speak to Hidayet? - Just a minute please. Are you looking for me, sir? - Are you Hidayet? - Yes. I'm looking for your uncle, Osman Reis [the skipper]. I haven't seen my uncle for a while. Where can he be? Nobody seems to know. Why are you looking for him? When you see him, tell him I'd like to see him. Ali F?rat, retired judge. Here's my card. I will if I see him. Shall we have a drink here? Hello father. Aren't you in bed yet? - Where have you been? - I was looking for someone. - Or are you trying to avoid me? - Why would I do that, father? You're all hiding something from me. What's all this secrecy about? They won't give me that autopsy report. The D.A.'s beating around the bush. I'm not stupid, Ali. Why's this case being covered up? I'll expose it to everybody, I'll demand an enquiry. And you're also going to show Erol to me! - Where is he? - In a safe place for now, father. You can't hide my grandson from me. I want to talk to him. Show him to me. As soon as it's safe I will. They've caught a suspect. What? Who? - Why wasn't I told? - The investigation's still under way. I hope they're on the right track. But I want to see my grandson. All right, father. Put up 500 gallows in Sultan Ahmet square and watch how fast things will calm down. If I had anything to say about it ... This is my village. I was looking for you. The door was open, so I went inside. That's all right. There's nothing to steal anyway. Apart from this. The first time we travelled by train mother took off her shoes. This train comes and goes like this all the time. I'm telling you this to make you laugh. And now you must laugh. Come on, laugh. It's a funny story, isn't it? This is what I'm working on these days. I don't want to tell a lie, Suzan. It's not easy free myself of this incident. - I have to make a decision. - What decision? - Is H?seyin guilty or are they trying to pin Erol's guilt on someone else? What difference does it make? One more or one less murder. - No, it isn't like that. I can save him from the death penalty. -How? His family told me his birth was registered under his older brother's name who died as a baby and was also called H?seyin. - What does all this mean? - That H?seyin is in fact nine months younger. I've got witnesses. At the time he committed the murder he's supposed to be 19. But if we know that he's a minor, he won't be sentenced to death. - Will you do it? - Maybe. I don't know. But why? Even if we admit that he killed Murat, what if we're mistaken? What if Murat's real killer is caught? You want to save him from the death sentence to clear your conscience. We'll never find out the truth. Let's suppose the opposite's true. That he's really killed Murat, and you'd be saving the neck of your own son's murder. Why should he confess four murders and deny this one? Because the other four murdered men weren't members of any organizations. And Murat was killed by an organization seeking revenge. Or maybe someone's trying to pin it on Erol. I don't know. I can't make up my mind. And what if they try to hang Erol? You'd never know anything anyway. You're so naive. I've had enough, Ali. Enough all your talk of politics. "What will people say? Let's not get married right now. Let's be serious." I've had enough! I got in here with a special permit. I can't do this again. I visited your home. I talked to Erdo?an and your parents. Why did you do such a thing? To find out the truth. I've got an offer for you. Did you kill Murat? It depends. I may have killed him, or I may not. Did you know Murat? - And Erol, did you know him? - What's your offer? If you sign a statement saying that you killed Murat, I can get you off the death sentence. So with one more murder on my record I'll be free? Yes, with one more murder you'll escape death. You're crazy. You're trying to fool me. If you think I killed your son, why would you want to get me off? I've got my reasons. You'll be hanged. But if another murder is added, I can play my trump card. That's just another of the D.A.'s tricks. He sent you to me. What are you trying to pull off? I have to get out of here. I'll get out and kill you all! I'll kill the D.A! I'll kill you all! Listen, everybody! He says that if I admit to killing his son, he'll get me off, - that he has a trump card! - What's he talking about? That if I admit to killing his son, he'll get me off. That he has a trump car, that he'll save me. No, go now. - Run along! - All right. Have a nice day, judge. Double two. And two more. Hello. Hello. I'm looking for the skipper Osman. Do you know him? - The weather's foggy today. - Anybody know where he is? - I'm going to need a lot of luck. - Double five. Does nobody know? Here's two, and one. You've played well. A good day. I'm looking for the skipper Osman. - He doesn't live here anymore. - Do you know where he's now? He went back to his hometown, to Fatsa. To Fatsa? Your I.D. please. Your I.D. please. - Good morning, judge. Where're you going? - To Fatsa. - Have a safe trip. - Thank you. Stop pretending. There's a dark red car parked outside. Leave by the back window and hide inside the car. Why did you do it? - Why do you ask? - I don't know. Don't I look like someone who would help a kid in trouble? Frankly, you don't. So I don't, eh? That's the way it is. And besides, I'm not a kid. You're a kid who can't appreciate a favour. The fact that you saved me doesn't give you the right to insult me. Nor does giving me a ride, either. I don't smoke. But feel free to smoke. Can we stop for a minute? Thank you. Where shall I drop you off? Wherever you like. I've never heard such nonsense. What do you mean, "wherever you like"? Don't you have a place to go? - I don't. - How will you escape then? Where will you hide? - Bless you. - I don't know. I haven't even asked you your name. It's better that you don't know. So I won't have to make one up. Where does your family live? I didn't ask because I'm curious! But maybe they could help you. They can't help me. And they wouldn't, anyway. - How do you get along with your father? - Badly. Doesn't he approve of what you're doing? He doesn't have a clue of what's going on. And you know all about it? Better than he does? Your questions are absurd. Great. So now you're accusing people who only worry about you. Why are you so interested in all this? Because you're in my car and human beings talk to each other. Damn it! What's wrong with your nose? The flu. And there's a bone in my nose I need an operation for. - Then get one. - I don't want to be cut up. Do you never think your father might be worried about you? My father! What do I care! Just because they brought me into the world ... - But they're your family! - You don't chose your family. - You can't choose your face, either. - True, but I can't leave my face behind. - Your hand? - If necessary. Let me ask you a question. Could you kill someone? If necessary. What if it's someone close to you, your brother for example? - Do you think your father's a fool? - He is, like all the men. Like me for instance? That's possible. Get out. Keep driving. Perfect. So that's what all that rubbish was about. Two-bit murderers. Get out! Show your I.D. Stop! Stay here! No. # come on, play something one minute, coming # Wait, let me find the right key. # In my home town with the seven hills...

Ali? - Are you ill? - I've caught a cold. Where did you find the gun, father? I haven't lost it. It was here all the time. Why didn't you tell me? I waited for you to calm down. I didn't want you to go out on the streets with it. You're no match for them. What have you done, father? What have you done? Why did you hide the gun? I did my duty as a father. I couldn't let you throw yourself in the fire. - Did you write the charge of indictment? - Whose? - The murderer's, H?seyin Alt?n. - You want some coffee? - Forget about the coffee. The charge of indictment! - The case isn't easy. - What do you mean? Listen to me. This affair is tricky. Not at all. I've found the gun. I was worried for nothing. Erol is innocent. I knew this right from the beginning. Murat was killed by H?seyin Alt?n. But this isn't what counts. They want to sacrifice Erol. I don't understand. What sacrifice? If you don't understand the conspiracy against Erol, and the campaign of the press, I can't help you. They want to make an example of your son. And bear in mind, from now on it's going to be very difficult for you to protect Erol. Hello. He's over there. Uncle, he's there. Do you remember me, skipper? How could I forget you, judge? Please come in. I heard that you were looking for me. I was busy. Remember that case where you acquitted me? Same story... Still the same business? It's for survival, but only cigarettes and whisky. I swear on the holy book, I've never touched the gun trade. Although that's where the big money is, but I won't do it. For old times' sakes. For old times' sakes. Tell me. What's the trouble? You've got to help me. I can't trust anyone else. You once saved my life. I'll never forget it. You're now going to save my son's life. You had two sons, right? Two little kids. They've killed one. And the other's life is in danger. I want him to leave on foreign freighter for either Romania or Bulgaria, you know which is better. From there he can get to France, to his uncle. I won't trust another man with this job. I'll take him there myself. I'm sorry, this is all the money I've got left. I hope it'll be all right. Judge, you forgot something. Take them. They're still fresh after 15 years. You really are in a strange situation, aren't you, Erol Bey? - The girl comes every day. - What do you mean? She's pretty too. Your life depends on me, Erol Bey. I know what you're up to upstairs. - And she's waiting for you again upstairs. I'll... - Shut up! - They're all the same, Erol Bey. Can't I taste her too? - Shut up! Where've you been? I was scared when I saw that you weren't here. What happened? Who did it? I'll explain later. Your shirt is torn too. Take it off. # [He sings the ?brahim Tatl?ses song: Ellere var bize yok mu - strangers have got her - why haven't we?] # she has cheeks like apples # cheeks like apples # lips like cherries # strangers have got her, why haven't we? So this is how we're to remember the day of the coup! The journalists are here, sir. - Show them in. - Very well, sir. - Go ahead. - You've already guessed. I want to talk about today's news. The story's false. But the kid in prison shouted it out to everybody. Do you deny it? I don't care what he may have told. - But you visited H?seyin Alt?n? - I did. - Why? I wanted to see the man who's being charged for my son's murder. - Didn't you offer defend him in court? - You must be joking! It wouldn't be legally possible either. And who ever heard of a father defending his son's murderer in court? Very well, Ali Bey. And is there really a trump card that would save H?seyin Alt?n from the death sentence? No. There's no way he can escape the death sentence. What a scandal! What's this story about your defending him? It's all lies, I'm telling you. It'll be denied in the papers tomorrow. Such things cannot be invented. Did you or didn't you see the killer? I did. How could you! How could a father visit his son's murderer? I want to learn the truth. Don't you understand! The truth! I want to learn who killed my son. Otherwise this nightmare will never end. And did you learn anything at all? I don't know. I'll never know, father. How's Erol? All right, I guess. I haven't seen him. Rest assured. Very soon he'll go far away. I'm sending him to his uncle. - How's Erol? - Fine. He's waiting. He'll leave for abroad tomorrow. And your troubles will end too. I must ask you to do me a favour. - Give Erol this letter. - Of course. Thank you. The ship looks as if hanging from the minaret, remember? Yes, while we played "Load the ship". He'd say that when he couldn't think of an answer. It really looks like it's hanging from the minaret. - Load the ship. - With what? With paper. - Load the ship. - With what? With lead. - Did he suffer a lot? - Load the ship. - Tell me, did he suffer a lot? - Load the ship. With chestnuts and coal. With kites, rats, nail polish, ropes. You've never asked this before, why now? Because you're leaving, and we won't see each other again. Take this. Tomorrow morning at the fishing harbour. I want to say goodbye here. Don't, Erol! Erol, after Murat there was no one who ... Later, I'll arrange for you to join me there. No. You'll come, you know it. You're the one who's leaving, not I. - Is his memory so ... - Ssh ... Have you never realized before? I don't know. You looked at me once very strangely. I wondered at the time, but... Do you remember the seven bulls of Lorca? [Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias ??? ] They were pushing me towards you. Why did you do this to me? You leaving your poison with me and depart. Poison? You know, I don't like any part of your body, except the scar over your eye. The first time I felt it was last Friday. I didn't want to leave you that day. Today, it's your hair. I'll call you when I get there. We'll talk for hours on the phone every day. You'll tell me what you wear so that I can picture you in my mind. Have you noticed? This is Murat's jumper. # I'm begging you! # Open the door, it's all my fault. # Open the door! # I can't look in your eyes # I'm finished, Yusuf. Only know this: # I love no one but you. # I love no one but you. Maybe we'll never see each other again. You uncle will look after you over there. And till you get there ... I gave all my money to the skipper Osman. A souvenir of your mother. Don't sell it, unless you're forced to. In 1971 mother was ill and my brother was in jail. And you were away. I was away on duty. You were embarrassed because of us. My brother was in jail, your reputation mustn't suffer. Your mother was on your side. I know. That's what you two had a fight about. You went away and she died of a broken heart. The janitor is there as well. HE KILLED HIS BROTHER Stay calm father, otherwise they'll suspect something. What do we do now? # The individuals who want to destroy the Turkish state... # have brought our country to the brink of Civil War. # The latest example of a situation where two brothers are mercilessly killing each other. There it is, in the evening news. As to Erol ... Sometimes people do ugly things. And now I'm going say something horrible myself. I don't believe those lies, but I can't hide Erol at my place. The neighbours are always watching me anyway. And you know, there's my kid ... Yes, sir? What was the archive no.? Which no.? It will be ready this afternoon, sir. Don't be angry with me. Father, it's me, Ali. You bastard. You knew. You knew right from the beginning. So that's what all your weird actions were about. You bastard! What happened, Ali? You look terrible. Come, sit down. - We've been friends since our student days. - Yes. My son is a bit like your son too. I can't find a way out. You know that he's innocent. I can't find a way out. He's innocent. Maybe the best thing is to give myself up, father. I can't see any other way. Maybe then the truth will come out. What if they torture you? - Gentlemen, you can't sit here. - Why not? That used to be the executioner's block. Those who opposed the Padishah were crushed by mace on this stone. Tourists are interested such stuff. Forgive me... a shadow has fallen over us.
