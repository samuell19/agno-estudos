[Laughs] - NICE LOOK. IT'S VERY-- WHAT'S THE WORD? PATHETIC. - ARE YOU DONE? - WELL, THAT DEPENDS. ARE YOU DONE SCAMMING ON MY BOYFRIEND? - ALL WE DID WAS TALK. - THE ONLY REASON BRIGG WOULD TALK TO A PSYCHO LIKE YOU IS IF HE FELT SORRY FOR YOU. - I'M NOT THE ONE WHO GOT DUMPED. - YOU'RE NOTHING. NOBODY. YOU COULD DIE, AND THE YEARBOOK WOULDN'T WASTE AN INCH OF SPACE ON YOU. SO WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO YOUR PATHETIC, LITTLE LIFE. THIS END OF THE POOL IS JUST TOO DEEP. FREAK.

WE'RE BROKEN UP. - SHE WANTS TO KILL ME. - [Laughs] DON'T WORRY. I GOT YOUR BACK. - I'M TRYING TO DECIDE. SHOULD I JUST GIVE BRIGG HIS INVITE OR SHOULD I MAKE HIM SWEAT A LITTLE? - WELL, AFTER THE WHOLE SKYE THING, I'D MAKE HIM SWEAT. - WHAT IF BRIGG DOESN'T WANT AN INVITATION? - OLIVIA, WILL YOU STOP BEING RETARDED FOR, LIKE, ONE SECOND? OF COURSE HE WANTS AN INVITATION. BRIGG AND I ARE DESTINY. - HE DID BREAK UP WITH HER. - WHATEVER. DRAMA. WE BREAK UP, WE GET BACK TOGETHER. WE'RE PASSIONATE. IT'S SERENDIPS.
