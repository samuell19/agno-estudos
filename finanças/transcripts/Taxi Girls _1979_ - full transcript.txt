(woman screaming) - You got her? - Lets go. - Open the door. - (woman screaming for help) Help! Help! - Thank you. Thank you. I love America but what really bothers me about this country is like there are people living here who are so poor that they are eating dog food. In Poland, you wouldn't dream of eating dog food. Not even if you had nothing to eat, we wouldn't eat that. Why eat dog food when you can eat the dog? (audience cheering) Thank you. Thank you. One thing though, one thing that really bugs me about this country and that's dating, last night my boyfriend took me out to dinner, to a drive-in movie, and then he tried to get fresh with me in the backseat of his car. Can you imagine how crude, I mean the backseat, if I can't make it in the front seat, I won't do it at all. (audience cheering) I tell you I'm so happy to be in this country. It's such a great place to live. Where else would I get a chance to wear underwear that had written on it Monday? - Get her, Sam. You're not going to be able to sit in a taxi after today, bitch.
