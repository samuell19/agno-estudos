1989, BOJONGSOANG DISTRICT And over there, our defending champion. Ajo Kawir from Bojongsoang! PARADISE LIES UNDER THE FEET OF YOUR MOTHER Only a man who can't get it up will face death without any fear. Yesterday, an idiot kid your age tried something. To last longer, he rubbed toothpaste on his dick. Hold still. Okay. Some men can't get their heads out of their pants. You remind me of your father. Iwan Angsa? He's not my father. Well, he called you his son. What do you know about him? He really wanted you to recover. One night… he secretly rubbed chili paste on your dick. He never told me about that. He didn't want to look like an idiot. You should get back at him sometime. Rub his dick with syrup. Then ants will swarm on it. Don't try to chew. It'll be a mess. Just swallow it whole. That won't do anything. Fine, up to you. Unzip your pants. Hold still. You want to be cured or not? I do. For a hooker, nothing is more degrading… than a dick that stays limp. Go home. We'll try again next month… if you have the money. Who are you talking about? The widow of the guy Mr. Lebe roughed up. Because the rent was late, or a problem with the fish business? Started out with the fish business, but Mr. Lebe really just wanted his wife. He put the husband in debt on purpose. The husband couldn't pay? So Mr. Lebe took the wife as payment. Ladies could easily use their bodies to pay off debts. What a slut. Hey, Ajo, how's your dick? What did the idiot do this time? He'll keep doing this until his dick gets hard again. Such a waste. All is good in God's eyes. Shut your mouth, smart ass. And leave God out of this. I don't want him to die in vain. At least, he should get paid enough to cover his hospital bills. Pay or no pay… I just want to fight. Do you know where to find Mr. Lebe? What's your business here? I'm looking for Mr. Lebe. He's busy. You can talk to me. I don't deal with women. I'll take that back. I would like to take you on. Your boss is a scumbag. I know. He killed a guy, then got his widow pregnant. And you're still protecting him? Hey, where are you running? The Bare-Handed boys paid me to be his bodyguard. Then you're a scumbag too! I took the job before I knew who I'd be working for. I'll gladly watch you kick his ass. But you have to take me down first. Because I'm not paid to be a traitor. Hey, idiot! You want to die? I'm looking for Mr. Lebe. I'm Mr. Lebe. Who are you? I'm Ajo Kawir, the devil from hell. What do you want? Iteung! Don't waste your breath. She's practically dead already. Take a good look at my face, if you want to settle the score later. Good. As a token of our agreement, I want something from you. I have some Chinese medicine. You can take it. Iwan Angsa… don't tell me you're scared to fight him? I'm not scared. I just don't want to do this job. I have to take care of my wife and kid. This will be the last time I ask you for a favor. I need someone to stop Macan. I'm done. I don't want to fight anymore. I hate to say this… but there's a kid who might be interested in taking your offer. Just tell me. His name is Ajo Kawir. We call him Ajo. I found him lying in a banana grove when he was a baby. Interesting kid. He might not need your money. But he'll take any excuse to fight. Sounds good. If he says no… our business here is done. That's why I like you. You always find a solution. So-lu-tion. Excuse me, young man. -Would you happen to be Ajo Kawir? -Yeah. Hello, I'm Uncle Gembul. Okay… So you're Uncle Gembul. Sorry, not interested. I'm not interested in fighting. No, I don't want to fight. Ajo Kawir is refusing to fight? Is something wrong with my hearing? You must be in love. What's her name? Don't be a smart ass. No need to tell me, just say it in your heart. Can you do that? What's her name? What's her name? -Iteung. -Iteung. Does your heart beat faster? Blood pumping through your veins? That's falling in love. What else do you feel? Sweet and warm. Sweet and warm. This is from a listener named Iteung, to the Hot Shot from Bojongsoang. Her message is, "Hey, Hot Shot. Remember me, from last week? You owe me some herbal medicine. Get well soon, Hot Shot!" For the two yearning lovebirds, here's a love song for you. I didn't know you worked here. It's my new gig. I quit working for Mr. Lebe. You… I mean… you seem more relaxed now. I'm enjoying it. And no need to be so formal. How are you? Did you fully recover? Yes, but I can still feel it. Feel what? Warm and sweet. How about you? Nothing serious. You're a good fighter. Iteung, it's late! Shut your trap! You're not my mother! Relax, no need to shout! -Relax, no need to shout! -Relax, no need to shout! -Relax, no need to shout! -Relax, no need to shout! Thank you. Now, it's your turn. No need. Some other time. My birdie… you need to get up! You don't need to find me any more work. You can't just walk away from me. Bare-Handed saved your life. I don't owe anybody anything. My father paid the full fee to get me into this academy. You need me, Iteung. Is that what you think? Well, you're wrong. Falling in love is like a disease. It can strike at any time, like lightning and thunder. You can't fight falling in love. Thank you for the song request, Miss Iteung. Hang in there. You can die from lack of sleep. I don't care. Go see her. Or send her back some songs. Tell her you love her or something. I don't want to love anyone. I want to kick some ass. You just have to make him disappear into thin air. Make it seems like Macan accidentally fell into the Krakatau crater. Do you know where that is? Krakatau? I'm not that stupid. Ajo. There's a lot of money in it for you if you succeed. I want to see the money, General. Stupid. Call me Uncle Gembul, understand? Okay, Uncle. A sweet hello to the guy who just drove by. I like your new bike, why don't you drop in? This is especially for you, R-O-C-K-Y. Go for it! Just try to borrow a helmet or ask for a glass of water and drink it slowly. Her parents might like you! Okay, we have another caller. Password, please? Lovers come and go like the wind But a mother's love is forever. What year did the Dutch launch their second military attack? 1948. This one is a loyal listener. So, Miss Iteung, what do you want to say to him today? Please hold the phone away from the radio. That's more like it. Go ahead. Where have you been? Why didn't you respond to any of my songs? I'm looking for Macan. Where can I find him? He hasn't been back here, since his big brother died. Don't lie! I don't know. If I knew where he was, I would ask him to pay off all his debts. Listen up! I'm really running out of patience. If I can't kill Macan, I'll just kill anyone else in this village. You better tell him… Ajo Kawir is looking for him. Ask him to pick any place, any time, and I'll agree to it. After that, I'll pay off all the debts he owed you. If you can find him… I'd be happy to hear that you managed to kill him. At least you'll have more time to get ready. You don't know how hard it will be to take him down. I'm not afraid of him. I just don't like this feeling. Missing her. Then, why don't you go see her? I'm scared. Scared? If she comes and kicks your ass, you deserve it. If you let a girl send you all those songs and don't respond, you deserve an ass kicking. Let me tell you… there's nothing more beautiful in this world than to die in the arms of someone you love. You've watched too many cowboy movies. I could never be her man. But you do have a point. I should see her one last time. Because, if I die in Macan's hands, at least I'll die in peace… knowing that I got to see her one last time. Why are you avoiding me? I've been dying to hear from you. Will you be my boyfriend? I can't be your boyfriend. You wouldn't understand. You son of a bitch! Iteung! Iteung! Why don't you say something? I don't understand what you want. Answer me! What do you want? I could break your neck right now. Is that what you want? Beat me up if you must. I love you. Say it again. Say it! I love you, Iteung. Why are you just telling me now? I didn't have the guts to say it before. Why not, Hot Shot? I can't get it up. I know. I don't care. I love you, too. Really? But what are you going to do with a guy who can't get it up? I'll marry him. Thank you. Iteung! Iteung. -Hi, Budi, how are you? -I'm fine, Grandma. How are you? I'm happy, of course. Have you heard? About what? Iteung didn't tell you? She's getting married. Congratulations, Iteung. I'm so happy for you. She's impossible. Iteung likes surprises, Grandma. Come, the heat is killing me. So many things to do at home. I'm waiting for a long distance call. Yeah, Budi? Why don't you take Iteung to the printers… for the invitations? Let's do it later. Invitations are not a big deal. But you don't have a lot of time. Give me a hand, Budi. Get home safe, Grandma. Let's go! I can go alone. Iteung! Come on, let me take you. I can help you with the design. I have some things to print too. You can use the same shop. -So you're making invitations, too? -No. Some friends and I are opening a leech oil business. I'm in charge of the packaging. Have you heard of it? Here. Leech oil is for men's vitality. Keeps your penis rock hard for hours. I'll help you with your wedding invitations… and you help me pick the right color for the packaging. What do you say? Thanks. But I'll do the invitations myself. Iteung. Hello? Is this Ajo Kawir? Speaking. You rat's ass. Your mouth stinks. Who is this? Someone who'll make your days a living hell. Your marriage to that girl will be a never-ending nightmare. Leave my girl out of it. If you want to fight, just tell me when and where. You'll meet me soon enough. Just pray it won't be the day you die. Listen, you fuck! You're no match for me. I want Macan. Ask him to come himself. Not just send some weakling like you. You better pray, my friend. Pray that it won't be the day you die. Hello? Hello? Son of a bitch! I have to settle my business with Macan. You don't have to kill him. Just return the money to Uncle Gembul. But we need the money. We're getting married. CONGRATULATIONS FROM UNCLE GEMBUL ONE MONTH LATER Budi! You're so late! I'm sorry, Grandma. My bus ran late. It's fine. Thank you for coming. Iteung will be thrilled. I heard your business is going very well? We're just starting. Wish us luck, Grandma. Ajo! What business is it? Well… you know. Young people business. Iteung, have you introduced Budi to Ajo? What's wrong with you? What do you mean? I'm introducing them now. Congratulations, Iteung. I'm so happy for you. Ajo Kawir. I've heard a lot about you. You're the Hot Shot from Bojongsoang. Not really. Now is the time for you to leave Iteung. Look at your face! I was joking. -Tell me what he said. -I was joking, Iteung. Budi, what did you say? Tell me. Budi was joking. But what was the joke? He said I should just leave you now. He's jealous. Are you jealous? No, he's joking. Excuse me… Iteung. Let me steal her for a moment. Even now, I'm still wishing you all the best. I wish you a happy marriage and very soon… a baby. Thanks. If you need my help… anytime, just tell me. I'm ready to help. Both of you. Ajo. You're a lucky guy. It's from Tokek. "Fingers help us feel things. Sometimes a touch could express more than words ever could. So, use this guitar to get your fingers in shape." NEW HOPE GARAGE Six letters for beauty? My wife. It's supposed to go from here. -Honey. -Yes. Your fingernails are getting long. Will you clip them? Of course. The government is determined to reduce the nation's birth rate with the Family Planning program and other population control policies. THE INDONESIAN POPULATION CENSUS 1990 It is expected that by 1991, the government will be able to lower the birth rate to 22 per 1000. The problem is that birth control methods are not widely used by men. Women still feel that it's their responsibility. Are you planning to have children? I mean, when your husband is able to have children. Or are you planning to adopt? No plan for children yet, ma'am. Can I just fill out the form myself? It will go faster. Sooner or later, we'll have to get our own place. No need to rush. Grandma loves having you here. If Macan shows up… we'll get a lot of money. Enough to buy a house. And my garage. I want to have a truck repair shop. I like your dreams for us. But forget about Macan. Have you heard about Macan's little finger? One day… Macan had a toothache… but he didn't want to see a dentist. He was afraid of them… because he felt helpless, completely at their mercy. He didn't like being stuck in a chair… while the doctor inflicted pain on him with a dental probe. So, he moaned all night from his toothache… and no one dared to get near him. What does that have to do with his little finger? He chopped off his left finger because that would hurt worse than his toothache. I don't know if this is true or not. But everyone who has met him swears… that he's missing his left pinkie. If the story is true… he is totally ruthless… even toward himself. He'll meet me. And I'll put a stop to his ruthlessness. Honey… you don't have to fight Macan. You have no business with him. Like I said… just give the money back to Uncle Gembul. You don't have to be ashamed. You don't have to worry any more. Hello? Am I speaking to Ajo Kawir from Bojongsoang? Who is this? This is Macan. You're looking for me? I'm retired. These days, I just putter around in my garden. You know where I live. You can come to me whenever you want. Sorry, wrong number. Who are you? Are you looking for trouble? Who the fuck are you? Fuck! Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you sure you're okay? I'm sure. SOLAR ECLIPSE 1983, JUNE 11th, 11:06 a.m. Iwan Angsa warned Rona Merah's husband that he would burn off his tattoo with an iron. But before he could finish… Bang! He was shot by "A Mystery Sniper." "A Mystery Sniper"? Sounds so badass. PRESIDENT SUHARTO WARNS THE PUBLIC NOT TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE ECLIPSE BECAUSE IT CAN CAUSE BLINDNESS They say Rona Merah's husband had an amulet of invincibility. So he couldn't have been shot dead! People say its power was transferred into Rona Merah. -Transferred? -Yes. To Rona Merah's golden tooth. Golden tooth. What could a golden tooth amulet do? Don't be stupid. You'll go blind. What are we looking at? I don't think she has taken a bath in three days. Are you sure that pen is yours? I'm sure as hell. Let me borrow it for a day. Patience. Wait your turn. Come on. I've never been this nice to anybody. I've never even given my own kids a bath. Even when my mother died… I didn't bathe her corpse. So just enjoy it. Tokek, I have a bad feeling about this. Out of the way! Come here. Get on the table. Go find the pen. When you find it… you'll get your turn. -Where do you think you're going, boy? -Tokek, help me! If it's true that it started that day, like you told me… So, you think if you kill those two scumbags… I'll be able to have an erection again? You think this is just about your dick? Tokek and I have tried to find them. I'm not even sure if they're police or military guys… or just plain scumbags. LEECH OIL In the middle. Here. I-- I need your help. To find two scumbags. You always know who to come to for favors. How much will it cost? For you, nothing. I'll do anything for you. No. I'm here to do business. You're not happy with your marriage, are you? I am happy. Don't lie. I know you. I can see it. I can feel it. I miss doing the things we used to do. You think you're faster than me? I'll always remember how I kicked your ass… and how you kicked mine back. Sorry if I was being too rough. Iteung. You're safe with me. I'm not Mr. Toto. I'm not that scumbag. My dick is even harder than his. You were only eleven-years-old. The school was empty. The classrooms were quiet. He was sitting there, watching you. Then he asked you to count the money in the cash box. He got up and sat down next to you. He leered at you and chuckled. Then he whispered… "Look, Iteung, your breasts are growing." "You should be wearing a bra." THREE MONTHS LATER Iteung? Iteung? Iteung? What's wrong? Where have you been? I just got back from the hospital. What's wrong? I'm pregnant. Whore! Are you Macan? Whore! Whore! Whore! How is he doing, Ki Jempes? If we let him out… he could kill a lot of people. Damn it. It's all my fault. You remember Rona Merah's husband? I didn't protect him. He was shot… when those "Mystery Snipers" were running wild. A lot of bums died back then, not just him. That's right. But he died in front of his wife. And then his wife went mad. That didn't have to happen. I owe my life to Iwan Angsa. If not for him, I would've been dead long ago. -Please take care of the kid. -Yes. Here, drink this. What is this? It costs twice as much as gasoline. I'M SORRY, AJO KAWIR I WILL WAIT FOR YOU, YEARNING FOR YOU ALWAYS I LOVE YOU, AJO KAWIR Uncle Gembul thinks… Ajo is safer in prison. At least, for now, he's safe from Macan's men… or people who seek revenge for his death. Are you sure we're on the right bus? Tell him, it's Tokek. I'm Tokek, his best friend. I came with his wife. Could you give this to him then? His wife's homemade sponge cake. At least, he knows you came to see him. I LOVE YOU AJO KAWIR I WILL WAIT FOR YOU Whore! The wall can't fight back. Whore! Whore! Whore! I LOVE YOU, AJO KAWIR I LOVE YOU, AJO KAWIR Iteung, my darling! How are you? I'm very well. Time to make good on your promise. Where are the two scumbags? You still need to find them? You've been gone a long time. I heard you were pregnant. My kid? Not your kid. Tell me where they are. Forget them, Iteung. You have no business with them. Come live with me. You're happy with me. You need me, Iteung. THREE YEARS LATER LONELY ON THE ROAD, UNWELCOME AT HOME I like our cargo this time. It won't rot easily. Problem is, what we'll be bringing back. What do you mean? -Most likely bananas, I think. -Hey! You're stealing my delivery! What do you mean? Those helmets are my cargo. You took them from me. Get them off your truck. Asshole. Follow me. REMEMBER THE FEELING, NOT THE NAME Ma'am! They're still here. This is the receipt. And their signatures. -You offered that load to me earlier. -You charged too much, so I chose him. Fine, you may haggle now. It's too late. I made a deal with him. He's delivering my stuff. You two can go. Your helmets are safe with me. Let it go. Are you looking for trouble? No. I'm just delivering my load. Is that all you got? I heard you killed Macan. I doubt that. Son of a bitch! Why don't you get dentures to fill those gaps? No need. Why not? These missing teeth have taught me a lot of things. Yeah? Like what? There was this kid… Truly an asshole. And? And we fought it out. I beat him up, black and blue. But he knocked out two of my teeth. Hey, handsome. So you want to fight? That's enough! Get inside. Are you nuts? He could've ripped you apart. I don't care. You should've let me fight. You want your guts spilling out all over the place? I've lost two teeth. A hole in my stomach is nothing. No one's coming to pick you up? No. I'm going home alone. Are you sure? As sure as the fact that one day we will all die. Iteung. I just want to give you this. Give the envelope to your husband. Only you can persuade him. Finish this business, and you two will live happily ever after. I want to be at peace when I die. I don't care about your peace. You have to care. How do you think… you got out of the prison so soon? Damn it! Hey, shithead! You want me to fuck your ass? Fuck you! Just take it easy. There's no way he can catch up now. His axle's busted. You saw that? No. But I felt it. I just gave you a chance to piss him off. And I swear on your toothless grin… he was really pissed off. Can I come with you? I won't be any trouble. I'll pay for my own meals. I just need a ride. You have to pay. How much do you weigh? I charge per kilogram. I don't have any money right now. Of course you don't. If you had money, you'd be taking the bus, or whatever. So? You want me to pay some other way? You can get me to do all kinds of things. It's up to my boss. Let me come with you. Just go in. You know those men? No, I don't. I was told to meet them. Do you know them? The one with the mustache. He's been here before. I told him we only do women's hair, but he insisted. What did he want? He just wanted his mustache trimmed. What's wrong, Miss? Nothing. That word freaks me out. It reminds me of my teacher's mustache. Was it gross? If a man doesn't groom his mustache right, it's not a pretty sight. Couldn't you have said no to him? My boss asked me to do it anyway. Turns out he's a retired military officer. How do you know? He once came in a full military uniform. He was going to an Independence Day ceremony for veterans. He asked for a crew cut. Miss. Do you need any help? How about doing the fishing for me, Sir? Who are you? You don't need to know who I am. Just remember the boy you caught on that godforsaken night… when you raped a woman named Rona Merah. Kumbang doesn't joke around. The kid will go to hell sooner or later. Kumbang is here. He's out for blood. What are you doing? That's Mono's money. He asked me to bet on Kumbang. Is he planning to die? If he dies, at least he'll be… richer than before. Stupid kid. You have to stop the fight. That's enough. Enough. You're so good at picking flowers, old man. I thought I picked every flower in this place. Even the one named Rona Merah? Who are you? Remember the little boy from that godforsaken night? And how you ripped off his pants and forced him inside Rona Merah? He won't come looking for you. He won't even touch a piece of shit like you. But I'm his wife. And I'm here in his place. What do you want? Hey, champ! You forgot this. How will you get home? They're paying my hospital bills… and they'll take me home to my village. Those military guys are all right. Of course… they got a lot of money from your fight. So what are you going to do with your money? Elope with your girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend yet. She's just a woman who laughed at me because I'm a "fast shooter." I'll spend the money on training. Training for what? Training so I won't be a "fast shooter" anymore. "Fast shooter"? Premature ejaculation. Idiot. You're an asshole. You almost left that kid to die. Who are you to tell me what to do? So now you want to know more about me? -Whatever. -Whatever? You don't like me riding in your truck? No, I don't mind at all. So, how should I pay for the ride? How long has it been since you slept with a woman? Don't you want it? Don't you want to try this? I'm letting you ride for free. I'm not expecting anything in return. You're not into women? I have a wife. What are you looking for? I don't know. Where should I take you? Where are you going? I'll be taking the north route. I'll go with you. Tomorrow, I'll decide where I'll get off. Are you familiar with the north? I've heard stories about that area. Like the story of a girl… who used to run around a soccer field… until she fainted from exhaustion. People thought she was possessed by a demon. This towel… I used it to dry the girl's hair. She was sprinting around the field during a downpour and then collapsed. I found her and took her to a dry place. Slowly, she came to. She told me… she wanted Mr. Toto's black bird. He used to be her school teacher. She was forced to sit on his lap when she was 11-years-old. Some time later, I heard the girl went to see Mr. Toto. She was listening to hard rock with guitars screeching on her Walkman. She waited… until Mr. Toto almost had her in his embrace. But before he could touch her… she fondled his pants. His dick was rock hard. Slowly, she stripped him down… to his underwear. The tip of his dick was poking out. She took his underwear off… and stuffed it into his mouth. Mr. Toto could not hold back his lust. He quickly drew closer. But she moved much faster. She pushed him towards the cabinet. And once his dick was between the cabinet door… with all her might… she slammed the cabinet door. Mr. Toto screamed in pain. But no one could hear him. He collapsed on the floor. Even after it got slammed, his dick remained hard. So, she did all she could to stomp on it. The new tiles on the floor were splattered with red. What was her name? I don't remember the girl's name. But you can remember her name, by remembering mine. I'm Jelita. Your dick is hard! Hard as a rock. Ajo didn't care if his dick ever got hard again. One thing was for sure. He was going home. He want to see his little girl. And raise her with the woman he loved. Iteung. I LOVE YOU, AJO KAWIR This is all I remember from my father. Fishing is how you learn to be patient. That is what he said… before he went to war and died fighting the Dutch. Get it, Jon! Is the rumor true? When the Big Boss goes fishing, he sends a Marine to go under the boat. So he doesn't have to wait too long for a catch. That's brilliant. But I've never heard such a rumor. You know why? The Big Boss is not the type of guy who needs to put his patience to the test. KEEP YOUR PROMISE… I don't know… if you'll ever forgive me or not. I want to be with you. I love you, Iteung. I love you, too. What do they want?
