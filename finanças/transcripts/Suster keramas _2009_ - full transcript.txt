First and foremost, I need to apologize. Do you know why I didn't tell you this? Because I want this to be a surprise. I've married Sofie two months ago. We have decided to do the reception after you're home. Sofie, please introduce yourself. I hope we can be good friends. Come on, darling. TEDI AHMAD HEY DARLING, WELCOME BACK. Thankfully, all my stuff is still there. I think I'll return to Melbourne soon. But this is your moment. You've been studying hard all this time, Not Tedi, but my dad. Do you know? My dad has remarried. And he didn't tell me. You know why? For a surprise! is our age. And she's not even a good one. Because... I don't know how to respond. -Welcome, Sir. -Hello. How are you? -I'm going there. -Okay. -Have some food. -Congratulations. Thanks. You're getting more beautiful, Kanaya. I miss you, Kanaya. Why? Don't you believe that I miss you? It's been three years, Ted. I'm actually confused why are you still missing me. Nay. -Let's take a picture together. -Yes, Dad. -Give me a moment. -Hello, sir. -Tedi, how are you? -Good. -Let's take a picture. -Let's go. Thanks for coming. Thank you. How are you? Be careful. This is a good song. You're so drunk, aren't you? Miss, you're really drunk. Please, miss. You're inebriated. Kanaya! -Sofie! -Pull her up! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya, open it! Kanaya! Kanaya! Grandma, are you all right? Please calm down, Grandma. Grandma. It's all right. Kanaya. What's wrong? Kanaya. So I'd been unconscious for two days? And what happened to the person that I hit? -Don't tell me, they-- -What do you mean? -You hit nothing. -No, Tedi. I'm so sure. I've hit someone or something. And because of that I swerved my car. -And finally, I hit a tree. -No. You've hit nothing and there was no one. I only saw your car hitting a tree. That's all. You hit nothing else. Kanaya! Come on. Don't worry too much. Besides, this is a small town. If there was an accident the victim would be taken to this hospital and everyone would talk about it. And I was there. I saw everything. And you hit no one. Okay? Or are you making this up to make me worry because you're jealous of your stepmom? Admit it. Because your stepmom flirted with me and tried to kiss me at the party? What are you talking about? -Don't misunderstand. -Stop it. It's not important. One thing that you need to know is that I told you the truth. Why would I swerve my car and ended up in a car accident-- Okay. Would you stop talking about it? At least, until you're fully recovered. There's something that I haven't told you. There's only you in my heart. You're the only one that I've waited. I was going to give you this before you left for Melbourne. But you've decided to dump me because you didn't want to have a long-distance relationship. I've decided to keep this until you're home. Take your time, as much as you need. But if I'm still in your heart, I want you to say "yes" when I propose to you. Grandma? What do you need? Grandma? Where are you going? Grandma? Grandma, wait up. Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? Grandma, wait up. Grandma. Mom! Mom! -Hello, sir. -Yes, ma'am? I'm visiting Tarjo. I bring his favorite dish, anchovies and nuts. How's Tarjo doing, sir? -He's healing. -What? -He's healing. -Dying? Healing. Calm down! Ma'am. How could it be? Ma'am, please be strong. What's wrong, ma'am? -He's healing, Madam. -How could it be? What am I supposed to do? Mom, why are you crying? Apparition! -Apparition! -What's an apparition? -Ghost! -Oh my goodness! Ghost! Not today. Tomorrow, okay? I'll go there tomorrow. But I really don't like this place. This hospital is so weird. Last night, something weird happened. While the other patient was just sent home. During the accident, you've hit your head really hard. The doctor said that you suffer a minor concussion. Perhaps you're hallucinating right now. Promise me that you'll be here very early. One more thing. If my dad asks about my whereabouts just tell him that you don't know. Thank you, nurse. Are you done calling? Yes, thank you. -My name is Tedi. -I'm Dr. Bertha Ngandingin. I'm sure that you're taking care of your patients skillfully. -That's not what I meant, Mr. Tedi. -Correct. I mean, my name is Bertha Ngandingin. Yes, I believe you. You've told me that. Wait a second. That's not what I meant, Mr. Tedi. What I'm trying to tell you is this. This is what I meant. My name is actually Dr. Bertha Ngandingin. I see. -Sorry, doctor. -No problem. -I thought you're trying to show off. -No. My mom is Bataknese and my dad is Javanese. And my dad gave me a complicated name. Okay. Now, about Miss Kanaya. Today, you can take her home. You only need to wait for a cover letter from me so that Miss Kanaya can be brought to a better hospital... -with better treatment. -Okay. So, everything is done here? Yes, just have to wait for the cover letter. -Okay, thank you. -All right. -Thank you, Dr. Bertha. -Bertha Ngandingin. Yes. Thank you, doctor. You're welcome, sir. What is it, doctor? What is it, sir? Nothing. Miss Kanaya, welcome. -Welcome, sir. -Yes. I'm Dudung, the gardener. I also help with house cleaning. Miss, aren't Mr. Ridwan and the madam coming? -Madam? -Madam Sofie, miss. What happened to Miss Kanaya, Sir? Nothing. Hey. I hate my dad. Don't say that. Your mom has died a long time ago. Your dad deserves to move on. But I feel unappreciated. He got married without my consent and with someone who isn't good. -Don't you understand? -Kanaya. I understand. Give your dad time. Everything can be discussed calmly. The most important thing is to have peace in your heart. Now I understand. Why I've never been able to replace you. Because my life wouldn't be complete without you. I'll come back here about two or three days from now. Can't you come sooner? That's what I want. But I have a workshop and a meeting that I can't leave. I'll do my best to leave early. If you need anything, just call me. Hello. -Lala, don't run. -Okay. You must be Miss Kanaya. The daughter of Mr. Dudung's employer from Jakarta. Let me introduce myself. I'm Putri. Lala's mom. I've met Mr. Ridwan once. He was with his new wife... Sorry, I didn't mean to say that. Do you want to drop by? Come in. -Here, drink this. -Thanks. Miss Kanaya, what happened to your forehead? Abuse? No. On my way here, I got into an accident. Oh, dear! But are you okay? Thankfully, I'm fine now. It's just, the accident was weird. But it's a long story. Did it happen on the road near the woods on the way here? Miss, that place is known to be creepy. What do you mean with creepy? Many accidents happened there. It might be one of the causes. Sorry, Miss Kanaya. But I need to go to work. Why don't you wait in Lala's room? -You can also play with Lala. -Sure. I'll walk you there. This way. Miss Putri, is there only the two of you here? Yes, after the death of Lala's dad last year, I've decided to move here. Fortunately, there is no other yoga instructor around here. So, I decided to teach yoga here. The income is not bad. It's enough for Lala's homeschooling. Lala studies at home? Yes. I haven't told you. Lala is like her late dad. She has a sixth sense. She's what people call an indigo child. Ever since then, her friends often made fun of her. They called her weird because she often talks to herself. That's why Lala refuses to go to school. So I have to hire a homeschool teacher. Miss, Lala's room is upstairs. -I'll just go up then. -I leave you now. -Thank you, miss. -You're welcome. Hooray, Lala is not the seeker. It's Miss Marsha's turn now. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Kemala. Don't be afraid. Your mom told me that I could go up to play with you. Who are you playing with? Are you startled? I thought Lala was playing by herself. I'm so sorry to bother you. You must be Lala's homeschool teacher. I'm so sorry. My name is Kanaya. Marsha. After my mom died, I've never returned here. Because it felt like the burden of her memories were too heavy for me. But when I feel sad and down... this is the only place that I want to be. Because in this place, I feel... I feel like my mom is still here with me. Oh, Kanaya. Do you know? That the things that you cannot see... might actually exist. And vice versa. The things that you can see might actually not exist. That's what my late mom told me. What's wrong with them? The people in this village are like that. They must have heard that you just arrived here. And that your boyfriend dropped you here. They love to gossip about things like that. Hey, Lala. Miss, let's play hide and seek. Let's do rock, paper, scissors. Don't you know it? Miss Marsha taught me that. Yes, I used to play it with my friends when I was a kid. So, we'll do it to decide -who will be the seeker. -How do we do it? Place your pointer finger here. Hooray! -Let's push! -Okay. Let go. -Okay. One, two, three. -Don't push too hard. -Okay. -One, two, three! Push. Be careful! One, two, three. Do you prefer to stand or sit down? -Stand. -I'll tickle you. -And Marsha will do Kanaya's hair. -All right. -Are you done? -Yes, it's done. That means I'm the seeker. Okay. Let's hide. -Are you ready? -Yes. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Lala. Marsha. Lala. Marsha. Lala. Lala. Marsha. Lala. Marsha. Marsha. Marsha. Marsha. Lala, Marsha. Lala, what's wrong? It's all right. She's fine. Okay, let's go home. Let's take her home. I trust you. Actually, I want to thank you for taking a good care of Kanaya all this time. No matter what, she's still my only child. I'll take good care of Kanaya. Asih. Room number four. I'm in the middle of doing bookkeeping. I can't leave it. Who's the senior here? This is Maryam's fault. She didn't work for three days. Go and do her job. Asih. Go. Come on. See, that's your fate after all. Go ahead. Come on, go. Asih, as nurses we might be underpaid but we still need to have a high dedication. We need to serve well. Do you understand? Why did it stop working? Hey! It must be the battery. But the patient in room number four died this morning. Nurse Yoyom must have been mistaken. Room number four is empty. MORGUE I hope you'll make peace with your dad soon. Don't let that woman put a strain I also hope so. You said you're alone there. There's only Mr. Dudung, my gardener. Who's that behind you? There's no one. Why are you trying to scare me? I'm being serious, Nay. There's a woman standing behind you. Nay! Damn. The line is cut. -Yes, dear. -Look at this ring that I've made. It's so beautiful. Please always wear this ring. This is the most precious ring. Even more than gold. Because you've made this. Hello. Lala. Kemala. I need to ask you something. Every time you pass by my house you're always looking at the second-floor window. What exactly did you see? La! You don't need to be afraid, just tell me. What do you mean? I saw that lady, miss. Lala. Lala, this is... This is my late mom. Yes, I know. The lady said that this ring is the most beautiful even more than an expensive gold ring. Because it was made by Miss Kanaya. Don't bring up your mom who has rest in peace. That doesn't make sense. that I'm only dreaming everything that happened since the hospital until now? You think they're only dreams? I'm sure everything has its explanation. I'm going to drop by after work today. I'm with Marsha and Lala, my neighbors. Now, promise me that you'll be all right until I get there. Lala! You startled me. Miss Marsha said that we have to cheer you up. So you'll no longer be sad. -Let's play. -Okay. We're just about to play. But it's going to rain soon. Lala, we can also play here. You're right. -Come on, miss. -Okay. Hooray, I'm not the seeker. It's Miss Kanaya's turn. Kanaya. Kanaya, what's wrong? Let's play again. Miss. Let's hide. What? Okay. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Lala! Marsha. Marsha. Lala. Marsha. Lala. Lala. Lala. Marsha. Lala. Marsha. Lala. Lala. Lala. Marsha. Lala. Lala, Marsha. Lala! Marsha, help me! Lala! Marsha! Help me! Marsha, help me! Lala! Mom? Kanaya, leave! Kanaya, leave! -She's here. -She's here. Kanaya! Kanaya! There you are. Oh, my goodness. Kanaya, are you all right? Don't lie to me. Don't try to pretend. My acquaintance is a friend of yours on Facebook. They told me that you uploaded a picture of you and Kanaya three days ago. What happened to Kanaya? Where is she now? And why did you lie to me? The day when Kanaya left home... she had an accident. Accident? Where is she now? Kanaya... She's at... at her grandma's villa. Calm down, sir. I... I promise that I'll take Kanaya home and everything will be all right. I promise. I'm really scared here. I... feel as if my mom's spirit... is trying to tell me something. But she told me to leave this place. I don't understand. Perhaps there is a connection between... that scary sliding nurse and my mom. Don't be afraid. I'll accompany you tonight. Thank you. Without you and Lala, I don't know what to do. You should rest. I'll make you a cup of tea. That won't be necessary. Just stay here with me. It will only take a while. Your hands are so cold. You need a hot drink. Just wait for a while. Marsha. Marsha. Hello. What? He's in critical condition. Both of his legs are broken. And he's currently unconscious. I think you should just go home now. It might take a long time for him to wake up. I'll wait here, doctor. Miss. Nurse, who's that? Maryam. Maryam? Not Marsha? No, miss. That's Maryam. Let me tell you something. She really loves to sing. And during holidays, we often go to a karaoke place. She once said that "If I become a real singer I'll change my name to Marsha." How do you know about that? Where is she now? I don't know. She hasn't come to work for a week. Yesterday, Nurse Ismet dropped by at her rented house. But the house was empty. Perhaps she goes home to Bogor. For your information, she's still single. Hello! Miss Putri! Miss Putri! Yes? Miss, please tell me who Marsha is. Marsha who? Marsha, Lala's homeschool teacher. The one who often comes here. But Lala only have one homeschool teacher, Mr. Soleh. He's also the Quran teacher. There's no one named Marsha. I don't know any Marsha. Miss, I need to see Lala now. -Okay, I'll take you there. -Right now. Lala, please explain to me. Please. Who is Miss Marsha actually? She's not human like us, right? Lala! Lala! Lala is like her late dad. She has a sixth sense. The things that you can see might actually not exist. NURSE CALL Kanaya! Kanaya! Kanaya! Help me. when I propose to you. Because my life wouldn't be complete without you. For taking a good care of Kanaya all this time. I promise. No! Look at that girl. Why is she talking to herself? -What? -Look there! What's wrong with them? Tell me. What did you see? -Maryam. -Maryam? No, it can't be. Tedi. Now, I understand. My mom's spirit told me to leave the villa because Maryam wants to have revenge on Tedi, right? Hello. What do you mean disappear? He's not even conscious. Dry soil? Miss Marsha. Miss Marsha has returned to where she's buried. -No. -Kanaya, hurry up! You can use my car. I'll amass the villagers. Hurry! Tedi! Maryam. Maryam. Maryam, I beg you. Maryam. Maryam. I beg you. Please, let Tedi go. I already know everything. Maryam, or whoever you are let me bear the responsibility. I was the one who hit you. Let me bear the responsibility. Tedi loves me. He did that because he loves me. Tedi! Tedi! Tedi! Don't! Tedi! Tedi! No! Tedi! -Tedi! -Kanaya, let go! -Tedi! -Kanaya, let go! -Tedi! -Just let it go! Tedi! -Tedi! -Kanaya, let go! Never! Tedi! Tedi. Kanaya, let go! Tedi! Let it go! Kanaya, just let him go! Nurse Asih and Nurse Yoyom. There's a call from room number five. Go ahead and check. Why ask your seniors to do it? Don't be like that. So, how's it going to be Nurse Asih? Let's just do the usual. THIS STORY IS A WORK OF FICTION Subtitle translation by Shelomi Angeli
