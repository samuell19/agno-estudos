Of course I can. Your daughter raped me. This... Look, what is this. What is this? Your daughter raped me, and this is evidence. Your reputation's gone if I make it public. How could you keep your dignity? Unless, you'll pay me the damages. It only showed you in the picture. My daughter didn't show up. Right. All right, it's enough. Come on, let's have some juice. Cheer. Two pictures together is a real evidence. What do you say? Hold on, if you want the picture back. You got to pay me first. What now? You are trapped by me. He's dead now. What does that mean? I've put in the evil charm in his juice. If I call his name 3 times, he'll become a woman. You're evil. Give me the money. Nobody can disarm the charm except me. I won't give you the money unless you give cure. Or I'll make the photo public. If you make it public, I'll call your names. I'll call your names. I'll make it public if you do it. If you make it public, I'll tell her to call. I'll call your name. I'll make it public now. I'll tell her to call now. Jack. No, I don't want to become a woman. - Jack... - Jack... I did it. Your charm is useless to me. How come it didn't work. Tell you why, I'm not Jack. I'm a fake. Pay the money now. We're fakes, too, she's not my daughter. Really? I tell you the truth. We're all fakes. Yeah? It's all right then. Everybody's fake. Really something. Who are you? Don't run... Stop it... Can't drop it. That way. No... Who the hell are you? I never tell my name in this evil world. Then give your head if you don't tell. I've been alone, and it is my only company. It's not so easy for you to get this head. O.K., you force me to do it. I'll use your blood to dye the sea. I've been wandering. Like a lonely boat on the sea. I don't care about death. O.K., then try this. My invincible killing Taichi. Go to hell. It didn't start yet. It's bull shit. How could you do that, who the hell are you? I have never ask who you are. Let's say it the same time. O.K. I'm Chow. I'm Chen. You're Chow. You're Chen? I'm Chen. Star. How do you know my nickname. It's you, my nickname is Po. Po in the orphanage, we grew up together. It's you, Po, now I remember. - How did you become so huge? - Yeah. No wonder I can't recognize you. What're you doing now? I cheat around for living. Cheating. It's to cheat people to get money. You bastard, you almost kill me. Well, we're of the same trade. - I'm mad. - Fa. Leave me alone. Go to get him back. You're leaving just like that? How can I recognize if you change again? Don't count me in, I quit. No way, you owe me money. You can't quit. Keep the coin, or I won't be able to recognize you next time. I know you're sentimental that you keep it. Now think of some idea to get that money. Don't worry, leave it to me. You screw up every time. In the trade of cheating. We can rank as the top of the top. So I think the problem we're facing, should not be difficult. Fa, any comment. According to my experience. It's not difficult, you agree, Ping? Yeah, it's piece of cake. But I think... Apple can handle it alone. It's no problem for me to take it, but we should respect Star. Thank you, but I think. If we can have Fa as our leader. We are invincible then. Of course, but Ping got some good idea. Elaborate it. O.K., I try to make it clear, but my idea is similar to Apple's. Apple, am I right? In fact, we are almost the same. Let's listen to Star for something new. Right, my plan... will stupefy you and the world. So please remain calm. - What? - What is it? My plan is to eat first. It's great. You bastard make me pregnant. Friend. My belly is so big. Don't pretend, this is my partner. O.K., don't pretend anymore. We're all in the same team. I'm pregnant, come with me. She's too serious. I told you to pretend, but not any more. Listen to me, shut up, you want me to... I got a plan, we just follow the course. And pretend all the way. First, I'll fake as that rich man, to deal with your creditor, then you fake as the house owner, to settle my creditor. That solves the problem. O.K. All right. - How come you didn't think of that? - Yeah. I got the hunch, we'll depend on you. In fact, I can do it better, look. I almost get my tears. O.K., keep trying, This time I'll ask my master. Maybe we don't have to pay back, and we can make money out of it. Oh, it's great. If Fa is correct, then it's big business. Don't know if it's a trick. I don't think so. Everybody move, come on. Check if he's ready. Brother. Well? Where's big fish. Coming down. You remember the conversation? Yes. Don't bluff me? Don't worry, I saw him memorizing it. I can memorize it now. - O.K. - Good. Hurry. This is a good place. Is the antique I lend you all right? Of course, I've been very careful. It's perfect. Well? Mr. Wu, would you come over here. Let me introduce Jack. This is beautiful. Hey, what're you doing? Jack. Mr. Wu, this is Jack. Daddy, Uncle, Jack, this is Mr. Wu. Please come to say hello. How do you do, Mr. Wu. How do you do. Let's have a seat and talk. Come on, sit down please. - You play his son? - Yes. - Suit you, you're both mean. - Yeah. Hey, you know him? He's my creditor. What? He, ah... Sit down please. What is this? We have the same creditor. Jack, Mr. Wu is our financial consultant. Would you tell him about your plan again? Any problem? Try the best. Try the best. I plan to develop the site of the orphanage. So I use one million to buy off the head, to sign the sale contract with us. But I heard. There're many syndicates attempting on that site, so I wish it can be settled as soon as possible. We didn't get the phone call yet. But it's urgent now. So I'd like to borrow one million. If he owns the land, why should he take bribe? He's not the owner, responsible for contract only. He said tomorrow is the dead line, or he's authorized to signed with others. Who is that head? I haven't seen him before. I'll go with the company's endorsement. If you can't support me, I'll find someone. Boss, do you think the trade is good? I don't think so. I don't know real estate, and you're not clear. It is too risky. Well, we can have cooperation next time. Sorry Mr. Wu, what do you do? What're you doing? You. No, it's not his business. I mean you. It's not my business, either. It's screwed. We will wait and see. You fake as Jack and sign the contract. Me? No way, I'm a man. Are you deaf? She said he's never met Jack. Boss, you want to buy that land? I use money to buy something? Did you hear him? It's a big business. If we settle the head and sign the contract. We can get countless money. You. I? Watch that woman. What about our debt... It's waived if that is done. - Follow me. - Thank you. Let's go. He took Shen. Calm down, calm down. One get trapped when he thinks... - he's the best. - Right. Oh, shit, what should we do now? It's not over yet, follow the plan. We need Shen to play Jack. Right. Listen to me, about tomorrow. Except my four wives. I need a man with wisdom and courage. Me. It's you, you have gut. You wait for me to come back with one million. Aiya Hurry, here we are. Bring it with you. Get off, quick. If anything happens, let me know immediately, got it? Honey, quick. You're always slow. - Get ready? - Ready. Hand in you home work on time. Got it, master. Get out. This way, gentlemen. Master, they said they're here to clean. Yeah? Did we call them? No. But the address is here. Have a look. We didn't call you, you're mistaken. Can I use the phone. What happened to you? It's emergent now. Help get my assistant out of here. I need here to be empty now. Get her out, quick. Don't come back unless I call you. No fear, deep breath. You got to pretend it well. You're dead if it's screwed. It's settled? Remember every detail, got it? Got it. Kids, where's the master's office? It's upstairs. Wait here. This way, let's go. They're coming, quick. You hold on. Go get ready, quick. Yes, we've talked to the master. Yeah, he accept cash, no check. O.K., we'll talk later. Well you leave it here. Master will contact you later. You can go now. O.K., I'm going. What can I do for you? I'm Jack from U.S.A. Jack from U.S.A.? - Master's waiting for you. - Good. Master, Jack from U.S.A. You are Jack? This is Jack. I'm his partner. And this is the recommendation. Master, about the land. Mary, will you leave us alone? What for? Go for some fresh air, go. Go. Why you're so late? Look, there're four contracts... waiting for me. The old versions are obsolete. Then we have nothing to talk about? Master, we can talk about the price. Here's the money. Watch it, that... We're taped? - Yes, let's go outside. - O.K. Quick. Clean the room now. It's deal. I think I'm all right. My colleague has done it, let's go. - O.K., let's go. - Help me. I take great risk... under the investigation. Don't say that, look at the contract first. Don't fuss with the little money. Oh, yeah. You sign it, you get one million. More. What more? Sign it. It's not enough, more. Don't be so fussy. More. Just accept it and sign it. - Damn bastard! - Sorry. It's good for everybody, right? Quick. I'm sorry, master. Nothing, thank you. Done, it's my credit. Hey, what're you doing here. It's screwed, we're found out. How come? It's screwed. Thank you. I got to thank you. Thank the boss, not the master. It's screwed, we're found out. It's screwed,we're found out.

That bastard beat my brother. Go... Come in. Let me go. One more. Where's that bastard? S.O.B., you beat my brother, I'll kill you. Where's my brother? He's thrown out. Brother... Who's done such a cruel thing to you? Talk, brother. Louder, I can't hear. Louder, brother. Who's done this to you? Did you see the one that beat my brother? Who does he look like? I saw him, but he... He got long hair, and beard. Like a mad man. He look like you. We tried to help, but he's too tough. He's too tough. I'll revenge when I see him again. I'll kill him for my brother. Cool down. Send him to hospital for medical care. Yeah, go on. Thank you. We just try to help. I'll pay back if I have chance. It's O.K. Let's go, brother. Brother, don't worry, I'm with you. One million. I've never seen so much money. Me, either. No, this is only a small fraction. That is no big deal. Right, ever since I've entered this world. I've never cared about money. Yeah, when I was flirting with girls, tips I gave them is more than this, right? Right Look at yourselves. So emotional about little money. You're an insult for us. God. Watch out. Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu, your syndicate offer one million... to get the murderer? Yes, that bloodless murderer... must be found, for revenge of my brother. Brother, I don't mean it. Brother, I'll revenge for you. No there is an accident here. The president of Jen-I group fell downstairs, and serious wounded. This is Huang for KTV. This is a flawless plan. Flawless. - It's an art piece. - Right. Is the room cleaned. Yes, no evidence is left. The owner won't find anything. What about finger prints? So you're not graduated yet. I've wiped them out by towels, and towels are burned to ash. The ash is mixed with earth worm... to feed the fish in the sea. And I get the fish for breakfast this morning, and eat it. After my digestion. All evidence has become shit. Great. And I left it in the modern restroom. I think it's in the ocean now. What restroom? The one you showed me... the lavatory shaped like a bed. I was forced to tell a lie about it. - It is a real bed. - Right. This... It's O.K., it's only shit. Right. Keep it. Hurry up. Where's the key. It's left in the room.
