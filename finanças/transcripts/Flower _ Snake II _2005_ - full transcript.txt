Hello? Hello? Aya Sugimoto Kenichi Endo Mieko Arai Fujiko Jo Shishido Yes? Hello? Who are you? No! No! Honey! Honey! FLOWER AND SNAKE 2 Honey! Sorry if this looks too much like your wife. This is quite a surprise. Written & Directed by Takashi lshii This is quite a surprise. Written & Directed by Takashi lshii Written & Directed by Takashi lshii Posing like that... Posing like that... You're probably wondering... why I'm messing with this stuff. But I can do a thing or two on the computer. That's not what I think... But they are very realistic. I wanted to bind her for real... but this way's okay, too. What about this? A dead ringer? Uh, well... I've never seen such realism. It's wasted on you. That's the problem with you intellectuals. Don't you give it to her every night? Well... At my age, it's difficult... There's drugs to help with that. Try them out. I don't think... Shizuko may be flashy, but... she's the quiet type. She has no idea about S&M. I think you're the one with no idea. I know what people hide inside. Shizuko is great... A real femme fatale. I want to ask her to model once. Please do. Brains and beauty... That's a dangerous mix. It's trouble. Thanks. Does Shizuko really have a face like that? Does she have a... Are you blind? I snapped pictures of her. Take a few poses, and you could make... a few risque pictures. You probably wouldn't want to, though. Will you publish these? The critics would have a field day. They'd get a good price on the Paris black market. Porn exclusively by Kiyoteru Oikawa. Like famous masters fenced by the mafia? Not like stolen works... They'd be sought after as erotic masterpieces. By people like you? A member's club... Rich Arabs wait years for membership... I couldn't... I know of these... You need a password to get in, right? When I'm dead, my work will sell. Deal with the devil... and your works will last forever. I'd come back as a ghost... to see how much I was really worth. Yet, you have many years left in you. There's so much I haven't done in my life. I won't die if I don't do them. You mean... Shizuko? You're at that age, too. Critic and art gallery owner... Lucky enough to have a woman half your age... But isn't there more to do? For someone who studied erotic art... you're far too serious. Don't forget that even people like yourself... should let their hair down occasionally. You only live once. Let my hair down? It's over. His wife said to thank you. I'm glad we did it. He used to say no one liked him... but he was loved by many. Yes. His wife left this. It's from his personal things. One man's trash... could be something of great beauty. "One man's trash could be something of great beauty." That's it, Toyama. I know of these... You need a password to get in, right? When I'm dead, my work will sell for a lot of money. I don't know anything about S&M. I've run a bath for you. What was it he left you? A bibliography. You look tired. This small font strains my eyes. Shall I do it? Oh! Tales of the Weird and Wonderful'? It's a rare work from the 19503. It was penned anonymously. What is... These depict medieval punishments. Durer etchings? The Japan edition. - See the crucifixion? - Crucifixion? WOMAN CRUCIFIED ON A SCAFFOLD Is this 19th century? Will you read the text for me? Okay... "The murder of a master meant... "your wife or mistress would be executed in public. "These nearly all involved... "a long, drawn out skewering of the prisoner. "It was said that... "the woman was bound and crucified with her legs closed. "But in reality the women were spread-eagled. "Strung up... "Splayed... "and her exposed vagina was to be skewered. "The crowds watching the scaffold could see... "the entire female anatomy. "Spectators would watch while pleasuring themselves over and over. "High-ranking women received the harshest punishment: "While being skewered... "they were subject to attacks from their executioners. "The cross made from hewn-off wood lies sideways in the pouring rain. "The woman, bound by the hands, is strung to the pillar... "Though she may kick, her captors put a rope around her wrists... "and tied them to the horizontal beam. "Her captors groan with excitement... "as they take off the woman's armor... "tearing at her clothes. "The woman is put in a cotton loin cloth... "and then the men stand forward. "Her captors splay the woman's legs out... "and tie them to the cross. "Ripping away the loin cloth... "they leer crudely at her." About the thing I was left... Dr. Oikawa? How about a massage? Lie down. There's an artist who looked like he would be successful. I've heard about him. His name is Ikegami? So you remember. Ryosuke lkegami. He went to art school... but he dropped out with Oikawa and went to Paris. You can't just call someone names in the art world. - Okay? - It hurts good. Oikawa thought about it... worrying about a talent lost. He wanted your help. Didn't Oikawa send him money? Ikegami's no good. He just took the money and kept drinking... with nothing to show for it. - I sent the money. - Really? If it was sent in his name... Ikegami wouldn't take it. I see. Go on. Before I die... I would like to help make someone famous. Stop it. I don't know what I'd do if you died. Well? Will you go to him... Take a look at him... Decide whether he's worth it or not. I want you to go... And make this decision. Me? Go to Paris? Shizuko... You've done it alone before? - Travel? - Masturbation. Never. Try it now. Please. What's up with you? Maybe I should try Viagra. Via...? No! Your heart medication... Oikawa gave me some to try with my young wife. No! He died of heart failure, remember? Oikawa said, if he met a pretty girl... he would take it. Ugh! It's okay. No need for that. Did someone say something? It must be tough for you to have an old duffer like me. You're wrong. It's enough for me to have you here. I love you. I love you. Bonjour. - It's this! - Stop! - Stop! - How many do you want? Stop it! I'm going to be rich! - This is what I do! - Then paint! - I can't paint this! - Ryo... Do I do this only for the money? What am I doing? Don't... I paint my own pictures! Stop it! Stop it! I never promised! Who the hell? Ryo... Stop it. Who are you? I'm Toyama's wife. You're Ikegami? My husband contacted you. Toyama? I see. Come in. I'm leaving! I won't help you again. Something to drink? Wine? No... No? I thought you were coming tomorrow. No, it was today. No again? - Can I take a look? - Go ahead. Take a look. Go on. Which ones? That's all. What do you want? To collect on your years of investment? That's all there is. I have no money. - Dr. Oikawa... - Dead? Old duffer. And which old duffer sent you money? Dr Oikawa was concerned about you. For 10 years, my husband... He knew what he was doing. Asshole! Do you know why I haven't painted for 10 years? I haven't moved forward since being critiqued 10 years ago. Whatever I paint, I just see myself smiling back. It's hopeless... You're a critic's wife... You understand... being afraid to paint. - Why don't you try? - You're right. Find something inside you. I will... You'll be my inspiration. I'll do you! Strip! Strip! Take'em off. I'll do you! I'll tell him that you're hopeless! Shut up! I won't be told what to do by an art critic! Then don't take his money! That's great. Stop! Great. Get 'em off! All your works are half-finished! Do you expect to make money? Do you think you're Modigliani? Lying here drunk the whole time... You won't make any money unless you paint! Modigliani lived for painting! He left a legacy! Great! Let me go! I'll scream! Finish a picture by tomorrow... Then I'll decide. It's make or break time! I need money! Gimme a digital camera and printer. You're not a photographer. I'll paint... With these hands of mine. To catch a moment with a camera... see it... and put it on canvas. I don't want to just paint... I want to find something eternal. God? You have high hopes. Maybe. Okay... I'll ask my husband. I'll paint... with these hands. I don't want to just paint... I want to find something eternal. He's not lazy... He just can't paint... He needs inspiration. Just a moment... Sorry. So I'll buy the camera... and wait until he finishes it... before coming home a little late. Okay? That's just like you. That's fine by me. Okay. Are you eating properly? Don't worry, I'm eating fine. That's good. It's easy to use, see? Here's my number. Call me when you're done. You have two days. Just a moment. Go stand over there. Stand there by the window. Quickly. What are you doing? You want the painting, don't you? Do it on the computer. I'll paint you. - Open up... - What the...! Undress. - Now. - Stop this! Shizuko! I think... you could be my muse! I'll paint you. - No way! - Come on. - Quickly! - Stop! - Very good! - Stop it! - I can't do this! - Brilliant! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it now! If you don't stop, I'll... This is actually your husband's request. - My husband? - Yes... I got a call two years ago... He said I could make a comeback... by challenging porno and S&M taboos. I couldn't do it then... but now you're here. I'm sure he didn't send you to model for me, but looking at you... I know I can paint again. Your husband's suggestion. Please... let me paint you. Undress. Quickly. No good? Fine. I'm sorry. Go home. Wait... okay... Just put your hands behind your back. Hey! I can do this. Let me paint you. Stop it! So it's really no good? Do you really want to paint me? You could paint if I was tied up? I haven't felt like this in a long time. Loin cloth... Lie sideways... Okay. Over here... Up a bit. Up! Down. Pretty... Even prettier. There! It's good, isn't it? See? What will you do now? Look at me, look at me! Does it feel good? I can see everything... Everything on show. Everything"- Closer... Closer... Everything. Everything. Open up! Now your tongue... More... more! More... more! Come on! Now for the red version. I'll tie it. Up! Lie down. It suits you. Come on... Spread 'em. Wider! Over here. I can see everything. Incredible. Embarrassed? You should be. You know... This takes two people. Done by two people... Stop! Two men... Please stop! No! Why stop? It's going in. One... And another... And another. That's two more. Suck on them! Suck! Stick your tongue out! More! Suck! Suck! More, more. That's it, you're doing well. Good. Here's number three. Talk! More! More! More! More! More, more! Not yet... Don't come... Not yet. Wait for the real thing. It's coming off. Yes! Now! Let me hear you! Talk! Yes! What the... Hello? Okay, Okay"- Just like the picture? Shit... Wear this. It's so pretty. It's cold out. No more... Enough. - Really? - Yes. Will you dance for me? Dance? Any form you like. Here on the roof. - Like a Buzzati painting. - Buzzati? Ah, the full moon. The end of the world? - Can you do it? - Yes. How long? A month? I'll talk to my husband. Three days... No... two. Is that all? How confident. Hello? Where are you now? In my room. I was taking a nap. I'm painting, but I've had a block. Can I ask you something? Put your phone on vibrate and put it down there. What are you saying? Concentrate on your painting! If I call you... I'll be connected to you there. I'll be inspired, picturing you like that. What? I'll call you back. Do it now. Give it a rest! Are you okay? You didn't pick up. I'm sorry. I'm still waiting. I was watching movies... And my phone was off. I just wanted to talk. I've been shopping. Clothes... Underwear. Yes. Yes. Yes, it should be ready tomorrow. Yes... Hello. Sorry... Did I wake you? Thank you. So, you found that special something? A goddess called Shizuko. But it's still no good. It's just porn. No, it has a certain something. What should I... tell my husband? Tell him you're with me. You have talent... My husband saw that. Talent doesn't matter... If you're smart, you can sell. Have confidence. Look at my eyes! My eyes! On your knees, ass up... Eyes open! Look at my eyes! Look right at me! Look at me! Look! Eyes in the mirror! Are you ready? Together... Do you think she heard me? That Parisienne? - Parisienne? - The pretty one. There's nobody; it's empty. I saw her in the hallway. Ah... That'll be the caretaker. - Won't you get that? - Can I ask you something? Why so formal? I want to sell that picture at auction. What? - My husband will buy it. - No... Porn sells well on the black market. Black market? Fenced stuff and porn... All of the highest quality. That will determine the price on the open market. I've never heard of it. Why do you want to? Your husband would know. Will you ask him? Do I have to? But there's one condition... At the first bid... I'll get it. Hello? Yeah okay, but... I can't. No... I said, I can't! - Who was that? - Er... my sister. You're running a porn shop now? Is this what all the agonizing was for? This isn't your style. You paint me. You do me. Use the rope if you want to. Please. I'll go now. I'll be in touch. Has she got you under her spell? Her spell? No... but I've sold myself. She'll sell my pictures. 10 or 20 a month will do. All I have to do is paint. We can live together. You and her? She's married... She's the wife of my patron. It's part of the service. That's all. She's the wife of my patron. It's part of the service. Yes... It's eerie how exact it is. I've seen it: it truly is fine. Unbelievable... He did that in only one day! He had a good model. Oh, he used a digital camera and transposed my face. Even so... It's genius. Definitely. Do you think it's just porn? Depends on the buyer. Don't know about in Japan. With your say-so... everyone will think it's marvelous. Japanese people think like that. You're right. He'll do more. Hello? It's lkegami's sister. Come in. You're going back to Tokyo? Yes... This evening. What about my brother's painting? Please. He painted it for us... and so we will buy it. - On the phone, you said... - Black market. My brother spoke with the owner of my club. He has a chateau and says he can sell the picture. Your brother told me... - Erotic art. - It's tonight. That's okay. Who you decide to sell the picture to is up to you folks. Fair enough. Don't you care about my brother? The auction's just for private buyers. They won't let me in. I'm doing it for my brother, but it's dangerous. Dangerous? Come in. I'll take it. Invitation? Here. Come in. 10 million! Any other bids? Do I not hear more? What is this? Do I not hear more? More? Stop! Sold for 50 million! We have a surprise for all our buyers. 10 new items are available in a special auction! We must withhold the name for privacy's sake... but a recently deceased famous Japanese artist... left these 10 unique pictures. CG-rendered without a signature. The first is entitled... Peeled Shrimp Contortions. 10 million! I don't believe it! Bidding starts at 10 million! 20! I have 30. No more bids? Wait! No! That is Ryosuke lkegami's picture! He's not dead, he's still 35! This is the original. What proof do you have that this is a fake? It's a copy! This is worth more than 50 million! Ikegami, you say? Never heard of him. The man's a genius. He is the future. So there's no point in bidding? Do you not have an eye to tell the original from the fake? If you do, then you should be able to recognize it! I have no eye to discern? Very well... I knew trouble like this would occur... I have a letter from the seller. "Taking into account claims of forgery... "I invited the model here. "Her name is Shizuko. "With the lady's permission, we will do a re-enactment. "By examining Ms. Shizuko's genitals... "and comparing the real thing with the picture... "we can judge which is the real one." So, then... Is Ms. Shizuko with us? Shizuko! Where are you? Shizuko! Where are you? It's me. Very well. First, we will compare the genitals with those of the girl... in the catalogue. Please undress. What? You want to prove your point? Don't touch me! Alright! But if the oil painting is proven the real one... and the CG ones are fake... you must promise to buy back lkegami's work... at the highest price! Agreed. We bid 10 million. 50 million! But if your picture is the fake one, you will be guilty... of befouling our 1,000 years of tradition here. As compensation, you must agree to model... in the poses of all the pictures... so that our clients can see that you are the person in the picture. What do you say? What do you say? Fine. Very well. Let us begin. Step up- Undress for us. All right! I'll undress. That's no good! Turn your butt out. You will show us all the evidence. If the painter was faithful to form... Color, internal areas, and hair growth... all in minute detail. We must examine all these points! Get me some light so we can see clearly. I don't want to hurt you, but... Stop it! Stop it! So, what's the result? Yours is the fake! So now you must do as you promised. What's your proof? Look at the picture over there. The mole! Like in the picture, you have a small mole right here. The picture you brought has no such mark. Take a look at your mole. Quiet! Witch! What are you after? You're quite something. Sullying our market... Are you ready? Come here! You'll have some fun now! Spread 'em! Show us how it's done! This is a mistake! Shut up! Open your eyes! Now... Compare them. Peeled Shrimp Contortions. No more bids? No! Open up! Let us look at you! Spread 'em! Not enough? Let's see your face. Look! Spread your legs! Can you move now? Suffering? Do it! Let it out! Now! Now! Let it out! Let it out! Let it out! The second work is complete! 100 million! 150 million! No more bids? A certain book tells us... that witches used to do it with metal penises. This one is a true masterpiece! But you said that I couldn't tell a real one from a fake. A lie deserves punishment! So you will model this one for us! Now... The third piece! Study in Clockwork! No! Stop! Stop doing this to her! Who are you? Were you invited? The blonde woman invited me. Shizuko fell into my trap! That picture... is a copy my brother made from the internet. It's a fake. So... You were right. I'm sorry for this, but... Don't hurt her again. Please. Please. 50 million for the two! Quiet! So, we'll continue with the auction. Study in Clockwork! Two-shot version... Bidding starts at 100 million! Move! Get off me! Ryo! Get off! Let them go! Move! Both of them! Where's Toyama? No! Stop! Are you okay? Where are you...? Give me Shizuko! Toyama! Where are you? Shizuko is mine! It's okay. It's okay now. I'm sorry. You made a deal... with the devil? Forgive me... I don't want... anything... Not fame... not fortune... Nothing... Forgive me. I understand. If you wanted to get a name for yourself... in exchange for that picture of me... I don't mind. How much... did you receive? Hey! Can you hear me? I don't want anything! Instead... give me Shizuko! You forced me to do these things... and watched everything! Satisfied now? Please... Give her to me! Please... I beg you. It's from his personal things... Honey... The innocent lambs... I had this room built... with the two-way glass. That is the painting that Ikegami finished in one night. I won't show it to anyone... but just look at it myself. You devil! What kind of sick person are you? Stop it! Move away! You don't have the right to love her! I would take care of her. Say something! Stop it! Don't hit him! Don't hit my special person! I wanted to do this before I die. Don't say that. Shizuko... I wanted to discover something new... but the price was too high. It's fine. Don't speak anymore! Take it easy. Come here. This is your homecoming exhibition. This recreates your Paris apartment? Yes. You painted this art in such a dirty room? It was dirtier back then. Who was your model? My sister. Sayoko? - This is Sayoko. - Hello. Didn't you clash with Dr. Oikawa? No, he was a fine man. I respected him very much. - But all this was due to the late Mr. Toyama. - Really?
