(SIREN BLARING IN DISTANCE) (POOL BALLS CLATTER) Yo, Rusty-James. Biff Wilcox lookin' for you, Rusty-James. I'm not hidin'. He says he's gonna kill you, Rusty-James. Sayin' ain't doin'. Shit. (CHUCKLING) Shit. That's tough. These things happen, Rusty-James. Maybe we should go double or nothing sometime. Sit down. Cats constantly fightin' and arguin' amongst yourselves, like typical fuckin' yabbos. Watch your language. Come on. Come on. Hey, uh, Benny, get me a chocolate milk, huh? So what's he doin' about this? This Biff, what's he doin' about killin' me, man? The deal is, man, you're supposed to meet him tonight under the arches behind the pet store at about... 10:00. Here, put a little hair on your chest. He's comin' alone then, huh? I wouldn't count on it, man. Well, if he's bringin' friends, then I'm bringin' friends, man. Yeah, but you know how that's gonna turn out, Rusty-James. Everybody will end up getting into it. You bring people, he brings people. You're gonna have to fight ‒ If you think I'm goin' to that vacant lot by myself, man, you're fuckin' crazy. Watch your language over there. Watch it. - Rusty-James ‒ - Bring it down. Cool it off. MAN: Just butt out. What the hell do you think you're doin'? Fuck you, Smokey. Steve goes wherever I go. Steve, come here. Sit down. Sit down and be quiet. Damn it, Rusty-James, it's been a long time since we've had that kind of trouble. Chicken, Smoke? Oh, Smoke's a chicken.

The Motorcycle Boy hasn't been around for two months, so don't go tellin' me about that. What if the Motorcycle Boy came back and found out? RUSTY-JAMES: What? I said, what if your brother came back and found out? My brother ain't back, man! All right? I'm sick of hearin' this shit. I don't know when he's comin' back, if he's comin' back. If you assholes want to wait around for the rest of your life to see what he says, fine. - Fine, man. - BENNY: Get down off there. But I'm gonna stomp that little shit-ass tonight, and I think I should have a few fuckin' friends there. - Are you listening to me? - Rusty-James, we're gonna be there, man. All right? We are gonna be there. - But let's just keep it between you two. - B.J. Right behind ya. - BENNY: Get down off of there, man. - All right. We're ready. I'm sorry, Benny. Sorry, man. RUSTY-JAMES: Man, I love fights, man. This reminds me of the old days when we used to have rumbles. Heroin ruined the gangs, man. Junk, you know? SMOKEY: I wouldn't know. RUSTY-JAMES: You wouldn't know, would ya? Ask my brother. He'll tell ya. A gang really meant something back then. That gang shit was out of style when you was ten years old. Bullshit, man. I was fuckin' 11. I can remember it. I was in the Swamp Babies. That was the peewee branch of the Packers. - SMOKEY: Yeah? - Gangs really meant something back then. Yeah, like getting sent to the hospital once a week. - (CHURCH BELLS TOLLING) - You have no loyalty, man. No organization. Well, lookit, I'm going, ain't I? If you think this is gonna be a rumble, you're crazy. 'Cause you and Biff are gonna go at it, and the rest of us is gonna watch. And I doubt too many people are gonna show up for that much anyway. Yeah, yeah. Listen. Listen. You guys, I'll be right with ya. I gotta go talk to someone, right? - Patty. Patty, hey. - (GIRLS LAUGHING) Who are you, stranger? Rusty-James, the man of your dreams.

Since when? - Since I first started having boyfriends. - Hey, Romeo and Juliet. - When was this? - When I was nine. Get back in there, Donna. First time I ever heard about it. Yeah, well, I haven't seen you in a long time. - What? I've been busy, man. - So I've heard. Hey, listen. I'm comin' over tonight, so you better roll out the red carpet. Yeah, well, we'll see. Hey, you're crazy about me. You know that? (LAUGHS) I am? Yeah. You know, you set up a fight and you recruit half the neighborhood, and now I guess you got plans of your own, huh? Yep. Take a walk, Smoke. If Biff's there and you don't show up, you know what's gonna happen to the rest of us? What? You think he's gonna believe we went there to watch? Hey, listen, man. (SIGHS) Split up. Meet me there at 9:30. I won't let you down, all right? Let's go, Steve. What's the matter with you? You got a cigarette? You know I don't have any cigarettes. That's right. I forgot. What's wrong? Nothin'. I'm just a little tired. That's all. Is it because the Motorcycle Boy's been gone? Steve, I don't want to talk about him, all right? Don't start up on me, okay? What's with this? - Huh? - It's a habit. I got into it. Yeah, well, break it. (WHISTLES) Hey, Rusty-James. Hey, Donna. Your sister home? Yeah, but I thought you were coming to see me.

(MOVIE PLAYING ON TV: WOMAN, INDISTINCT) MAN: Keep 'em covered, Wong. Joan, see if she has a gun. So, how have you been? Donna. MAN: You can put your hands down if you want. Rokoff ‒ Donna! ...I have some questions I would like to ask you. I get the picture. Will you answer them now, or shall I telephone for the police? All right, get out of here, Donna. - WOMAN: I lied to you. - MAN: Stand back. WOMAN: I was wrong. I was wicked, but what could I do? I never intended for things to go as far as they have. - He forced me. - MAN: He? - DONNA: Yuck. - MAN: Who is he? (DRY CHUCKLE) DONNA: You guys aren't supposed to do that in front of me. Donna, go to your room. Now. It's bedtime. I should do my ten-page report on you ‒ including illustrations. - (RUSTY-JAMES CHUCKLES) - PATTY: You're gonna get it. DONNA: Have fun. MAN: What happened to Grogan? You know, I really missed you. You know that? MAN: He means to look in there. WOMAN: The old man, he came on the ship. I saw him. MAN: It's the old man, all right. But it's Grogan too. I could never forget him. I want the name of the man who did this. Miss Rokoff, you promised to help us in return for our protection, but we can't protect you unless you tell us the name of the man ‒ Wong! (WATCH TICKING) WONG: I fear that she's hypnotized. (WATCH TICKING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) WONG:...just lowly houseboy. (MOVIE CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) MAN: No. The evidence says they act involuntarily. We must get Miss Rokoff to a hospital so we can get the rest of her confession. Take care of him. (TICKING CONTINUES) ROKOFF: He hates both the European and Asiatic races. RUSTY-JAMES: Oh, baby. His hatred for the Chinese is so great that he has become a madman on the subject. A madman bent on extermination. And he will succeed in his plans if his inventions are not destroyed. He has a machine which is an advanced form of television. (SIGHS) Rusty-James. Rusty-James. Wake up. What the fuck are you doin'? Jesus. What time is it? Is it morning or night? Night.

MOTORCYCLE BOY: You'll be all right. I'll take care of you. It's a little bit late for you, isn't it, Steven? - Better get on home, boy. - Yes, sir. You know, I'd watch the company I kept if I were you. (THUNDER RUMBLING) You know, I really thought he'd left town for good. Yeah? May-Maybe he missed you too much, man.

Okay, I'm just gonna take a look. Here, take a swig of this. That's a lot of blood. (EXHALES) Oh, fuck. (SCREAMS) Fuck! What are you doing? That must hurt. You know, he ought to go to a doctor.

What do you think? STEVE: What's wrong with him? RUSTY-JAMES: He goes deaf sometimes. He's color-blind too. Lot of people are color-blind. It's no big deal. STEVE: He looks so old. I forget he's just 21. RUSTY-JAMES: Yeah? That's pretty old. STEVE: Nah. He looks really old. Like... 25 or something. (ALCOHOL SLOSHES, ECHOING) Steve, you know what? I've been thinkin', man. And I think that when I get older, I'm gonna look a lot like him. - You know what I mean? - (SCOFFS) No way. What? Tell me what's different. Well, for one thing... the Motorcycle Boy ‒ I never know what he's thinking. But you ‒ (CHUCKLES) I always know what you're thinking. MAN: Okay, you guys.

(CHUCKLES) Not me, man. I got homesick. (SNORING) MAN:...a few things that we reviewed at the beginning of the year. You'll notice the students are working on the machines. I want you to observe how they're dressed. One of the most important aspects of safety is eye protection. There is a state law that requires us to furnish you with eye protection. It's probably one of the most important requirements that we teach all year. After all, safety is the number one thing that we try to get over in shop. In regard to eye protection, we have three devices that we use. Face shields, your eye goggles... We talked, and she made us copy "I will not talk" a million times. - What? - I was explaining to this other girl. You know Stephanie. I explained what happened. It was during break ‒ (CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) - Hey. - What are you doing here? Those are my mother's cigarettes. What are you doing? You know, when I was a girl, my boyfriend took me places. - Mother. - Hurry up. Listen, listen. I'll take you somewhere, babe. - Don't worry about it. It never mattered. - No, no, no, no. We'll go to that Matoaka concert tonight. And then maybe afterwards, uh ‒ Maybe afterwards we'll, you know, go somewhere private. - Okay? - You know you can't afford the tickets. - No, no. - It doesn't matter. No, I'll get some money. And then, you know, just get dolled up and don't worry about that. And I'll come by and pick you up around 7:00 or 8:00 or something. Okay. - (CHUCKLES) - MOTHER: Patty. Get in the house. (SIGHS) See you tonight. - Hi. - Move it. Just fuckin' move, huh? What are you ‒ Charming child. What is this, huh? Huh? What is this? He just gets back, you're already hangin' around buggin' him. Why? Why do you dislike me so much? I mean, I've always tried to be your friend. No, I didn't say I dislike you. I just don't like substitute teachers livin' in my building. All right? Oh, what is this? You think just 'cause you read the same books as him? Doesn't mean shit. Means nothing. You don't know him. You don't know him. - You know nothing, man! - I know. You're just another one of his chicks, man. He don't like you any more than he likes any of the rest of 'em. He doesn't like me now. Period. (MOANING) What's the matter? You're shootin' up? Fuckin' heroin, man. Me and him, we never did dope. Ruined the gangs. It ruined everything. If I ever caught my girlfriend doin' that shit, I'd break her fuckin' arm. Only her arm? I wish he would show me that much mercy. I'm not hooked though. You see, I just thought it might help me a little bit. I thought he was gone for good... and I was wrong. But I was right. No, no, no, no. You were wrong. You're wrong. You're fuckin' wrong, man. He's back. Always talkin' crazy. (SPITS) (WATER DRIPPING) MOTORCYCLE BOY: Poor kid.

Will you talk to me? Why? - I don't know. - Why? - Why what? - Why? What? Why are you fucked up all the time one way or another? Huh? I don't know, man. I don't know.

Fuck. - Rusty-James? - What? - Will you do me a favor? - What? - Come over here. Let's have a little more respect around here from now on, huh? Fuck you. No, I'm only kiddin'. I'm glad you're back. Really. - Come here. Come here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come over here. Come on. I'll hold him. You pants him. BENNY: Time is a funny thing. (CHUCKLES) Time is a very peculiar item. You see, when you're young ‒ you're a kid ‒ you got time. You got nothin' but time. Throw away a couple of years here, a couple of years there. (CHUCKLES) It doesn't matter. You know. The older you get, you say, "Jesus, how much I got?" I got 35 summers left." Think about it. Thirty-five summers. (CHATTERING, LAUGHING) Would you quiet down?

Well, there's a picture of me in this magazine. Whoa. Nice. Is there an article in here about you? No. Some photographer took my picture when I was out in California. This is a good picture, man. Man, wait until those guys hear about this shit, man. No, no, no. Don't. Rusty-James, I'd rather you didn't tell anyone. I mean, God knows it's gonna get around soon enough. - All right. All right. That's cool. - You know what I mean? I'm tired of all this Robin Hood, Pied Piper bullshit. I'd just as soon stay a neighborhood novelty, if it's all the same to you. - Mmm. - You know? Hey, I know what you mean when you say the Pied Piper, man. Those fuckin' guys would have followed you anywhere, man. They probably still would. - Think about it. - The Pied Piper. What do you mean the Pied Piper? Well, you said it, not me. But ‒ But I get what you mean, man. I mean, fuck. Like the guy with the flute, man. They would have followed you anywhere. Anywhere.

Hey, you don't see colors, do you? STEVE: And you're deaf too. Rusty-James told me that. What does it all look like to you? Black-and-white TV with the sound turned low. I thought color-blind people couldn't see red or green or brown or something like that. - (CROWD CHATTERING) - WOMAN: You wanna wait for them? (VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS) You know, it seems to me like I can remember seeing colors. It was a long time ago. Yeah? You know, I stopped being a kid when I was five. Yeah? I wonder when I'm gonna stop being a little kid. - (CHUCKLES) - Not ever. I saw our mother when I was out in California. You mean she's alive? Huh? In California, huh? - (CROWD CHATTERING) - (♪♪ ROCK) - (BOTTLE SHATTERS) - (HORN HONKS) You know, I saw her on television. I was sitting in a comfortable bar, and I was minding my own business. They had one of those award shows on the TV, and when the camera went over the audience, I saw her. Yeah? And I knew, if I went out to California, I'd find her. - And I did. - I thought she was dead, man. And now I know. Now I know why the old man always said, "You look exactly like your mother." Yeah? I must look like her too, huh? (HORNS HONKING) She's living with a fucking movie producer. (CHUCKLES) Or she was then. I don't know. Was she ‒ Was she glad to see you? - Oh, yeah. She was. Yeah. - Yeah? She said it was the funniest thing she ever heard of. She even wanted me to come in and move in with her. California is a... (CHUCKLES) Yeah, it's very funny. It's even ‒ even better than here. California's nice, huh? Nice place? California? California's like a... Yeah, California's like a beautiful, wild ‒ beautiful, wild girl on heroin... who's high as a kite, thinkin' she's on top of the world... (SQUEALING) ...not knowin' she's dying, even if you show her the marks. Hey, man. It's so cool over here. I really dig it over here. The lights. All these people, man. I love crowds. Ah, you know, I don't know why. Maybe it's because, uh ‒ MAN: ...the New York Times or the New York Post. Daily News. ...I can't stand being left alone, man. I ‒ I really can't. I fuckin' ‒ I feel like ‒ I feel like I'm gettin' choked. You know what I mean? I feel like I'm being choked. See, you can deal with it. See, when you were two years old and I was six, your mother decided to leave. You know, she took me with her. When the old man found out, he went on a three-day drunk. He told me it was the first time that ‒ He told me it was the first time he ever got drunk. - Come on, Steve, get off me. - Hey, look. - I imagine he liked it. - Go ahead. What were you saying? - Hey, sweetie. Would you like a date? Huh? - What were you saying? Go ahead. I said he told me it was the first time he ever got drunk. And anyway, you see, he left you alone in the house for those three days. You know, we didn't live where we do now. - It was a very large house. And, uh... - (BACKGROUND NOISE FADES) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (VOICE ECHOING) Anyway, what happened was, uh, eventually she dumped me, and they took me back, uh, to the old man. He sobered up enough to go home. And I suppose that, uh ‒ (CLOCK CHIMING) ...that's how you developed your fear of being alone. MOTHER: And I'm leaving! - You never told me that before. - (DOOR SLAMS) - (BACKGROUND NOISE RESUMES) - MAN: Hold it right there a sec. No. I didn't think it'd do you any good. (♪♪ ROCK) (PEOPLE CHATTERING, LAUGHING) STEVE: Come on. Lookit, lookit! Watch it, man. Out of my way. Hey, ugly, get the fuck out of my way. Hey! What are you doing? Don't do that. - Steve, don't bug me. - Hey! - All right, Steve, don't bug me. - You just don't go pounding on people. - Steve, I'm not in the mood for you, man. - What are you doing? - Why are you pounding on people like that? - I'm not in the mood. All right? - (BOTTLE SHATTERS) - RUSTY-JAMES: Man! You think it would've crossed his mind to tell me that he saw our mother when he went to California. - Who? - If it was me, I would have told him. That's just something he should've told me, all right? I'm his brother. I got a right to know this, man. STEVE: What are you talking about? (♪♪ BAND PLAYING FUNK) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (MAN CHATTERING) Hey, how you doin', my man? WOMAN: To hell with you. I'm sick and tired of ‒ Help! (SHOUTING) MAN: Do you know who the fuck I am?

Rusty, let's get out of here. Come on. Let's go. Wake up. - Wake up. - Fuck. Don't go to sleep. (MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING, ROARING) - Where'd he go? - This guy ‒ This band's good. - Hey. Come on. Where'd he go? - Hey. STEVE: Who? (♪♪ CONTINUES, MUFFLED) Where's the living legend? He probably swiped a cycle and took off or something. (BELLS TOLLING IN DISTANCE) STEVE (WHISPERING): I thought we were sticking to the middle of the streets. RUSTY-JAMES (SLURRING): I'm in a hurry. STEVE: Well, if you're scared, I should be terrified. RUSTY-JAMES: Hey, I ain't scared, man. This place just gives me the creeps. I just don't like dark, empty alleys, all right? STEVE (WHISPERING): It's the same thing. - RUSTY-JAMES: Why are you whispering? - (WHISPERING) I'm not whispering. Would you slow down? (CHAINS JANGLING) STEVE: Oh, God, we're dead. - You got any bread? - (STEVE COUGHS) What? He's not gonna bash us even if we got bread? - Sure, that's it. - Progressive country. - Steve. - Integrated mugging. Yo, I ain't got no fuckin' money, man. We don't want any trouble. Hey, really, man. We don't want any trouble. We really don't want any trouble. Fuck off, man! STEVE: Rusty-James! - (BOTTLE CLATTERS) - (GRUNTS) - STEVE: Rusty-James. - (GROANS) Rusty-James! Six dollars. - (SOBBING) Oh! Rusty-James? - MAN: What's he got? Couple of bucks. Something for cigarettes. - MAN: This motherfucker's got nothing. - STEVE: Help! - MAN: Son of a bitch! - STEVE: Rusty-James! - (PATTY SOBBING) - (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) (SOBBING CONTINUES) Patty, you were the only one. I swear, baby. (SOBBING) A toast to Rusty-James, a very cool dude. ALL: To Rusty-James! STEVE (SOBBING): Rusty-James, please! Steve! - (GRUNTS) - Steve! (STEVE SOBBING) Come on, motherfucker. Come on! No. No! (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) - Rusty-James? - What? Rusty-James, you still alive? Yeah. No. I don't know. (GROANS) My stomach. My head. What happened to those guys that creamed us, man? He bashed 'em. Clobbered 'em. He nailed one of them really good. The other took off. Way to go, man. Way to go. You're going to the hospital this time, Rusty-James. I mean it. - (COUGHS) - Back when the rumbles were goin' on, - man, we used to ‒ - Oh, would you shut up about that! - Every day somebody was getting mangled. - I said shut up! STEVE: You and your gangs. It was bullshit, Rusty-James. It wasn't anything you think it was. A bunch of punks killing each other. - Hey, Steve. You don't know nothin' about it. - Don't tell me I don't know nothin'. - You don't know nothin' about it. - You tell him! You! Tell him. (INSECT BUZZING) It wasn't anything. You see? - What? - You see? Did you hear him? Man, you must have thought it was something. You were the fuckin' president, man. Yeah, well, you know, it was fun at first. Then it got to be a big bore. You know, I managed to get credit for ending the rumbles simply because everyone knew that I... knew that they were a big bore. I mean, they were gonna end anyway. There was too many people who were doin' dope. Don't say it was fun. It wasn't fun. Well, I was speaking from personal experience. I mean, most of them, uh ‒ (CHUCKLES) ...didn't think it was fun when we had a fight. Man, most of them were scared stiff. I mean, blind terror in a fight can easily pass for courage. There was something about it I remember. Aw, you're just stupid enough to have enjoyed it. - Fuck you. - Yeah, well, you remember something, Stevie. Loyalty is his only vice. STEVE: The Motorcycle Boy. I wonder why somebody hasn't taken a rifle and blown your head off. Well, even the most primitive society has an innate respect for the insane. (OBJECT CLANKING) I want to go home. Hey, cheer up. Listen. I mean, the gangs are gonna come back... once they get the dope off the streets. You know, people will persist in joining things. I mean, you'll see the gangs come back. If you live that long. - (♪♪ BENNY HUMMING) - (POOL BALLS CLATTERING) (BENNY CHEWING GUM) (♪♪ CONTINUES) BENNY: What's the matter with you? I ain't never seen you sit still so long. (♪♪ HUMMING) How do you know when someone's crazy? (CHUCKLES) Well... you don't always. It depends on how many people think they're crazy. (♪♪ HUMMING) (POOL BALLS CLATTERING) Whoa, yeah. - Whoo! - Whoo! Wow. So fuckin' hot in here, man. Here comes your old lady, Rusty-James. - What? - Patty. - Yeah? - Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Hey, she means business. Hey. Coke, Benny. (GROANS) Shit. (GROANING) - Thanks. - Man. - (GROANS) You lookin' for me? - Nope. Hey, doll. (GROANS) Shit. You really look nice. You look really beautiful. - How you doin'? - PATTY: Fine. - Did you know I got a gift for you? - For me? Uh-huh. That was ‒ That was me on my five-year-old birthday party. I was ‒ I was good-lookin' even back then. (GIGGLES) Thank you. - You want something, Rusty-James? - What? Can I help you? Nah. I think we should step outside. Hey, I'm not gonna fight you, man. I just said just... go outside and talk. Look at you, man. Look at you. It wouldn't be fair now. You're not in any condition to fight, Rusty-James. RUSTY-JAMES: I told you. I didn't say nothin' about fighting. I didn't want to fight you. Did I say I wanted to fight you? I said we'll go outside... and, uh, talk. Communicate. Get it, man? All right. Smokey, the other night, when we were out at the lake house with your cousin... and those chicks were there... did you plan for it to get back to Patty, huh? Maybe she'd break up with me and you could move in and take over maybe while I was still fucked up from the fight? Look at me, goddamn it. Did you? Well, I guess I did. I kind of thought about it. I would've never been able to think of something like that. I know. Rusty-James... if there were still gangs around, I'd be president and not you. You'd be second lieutenant. You know, you might have made it a while on the Motorcycle Boy's rep... but you ain't got your brother's brains. You've gotta be smart to run things. It's nothin' personal, Rusty-James... but nobody would follow you into a gang fight... 'cause you get people killed. Nobody wants to be killed. Well... (SIGHS) I guess you're right. Nobody wants to get killed. So you really like Patty, huh? - Huh? You like her? - Yeah. Even if she wasn't your chick, I'd still like her. - It's all yours, man. - Don't flatter yourself. - Hey, boys. - (COIN CLINKS) Hey, man. You better be careful, you know. That cop Patterson is looking for just one excuse to get him, man. Yeah? I remember he beat me up once. Got me locked up in juvenile hall for the weekend. He's been after both of us for years. He's a good cop, man. The Motorcycle Boy seems to be his only bad point. He'll never get the Motorcycle Boy on anything, man. Never. Envy, man. Gotta be envy. (SIGHS) - You seen him? - Yeah, man, I seen him over at the pet store. - What was he doin' there? - Lookin' at the fish, as far as I could tell. Those fuckin' fish. What is it with those fuckin' fish, man? (TRAIN PASSING) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (BIRDS CHIRPING, SQUAWKING) Hey, what's up? Hey. Hey, what's the matter, man? Huh? Really, are you feelin' all right? How come the tank is separated? These are rumble fish. - They'd kill each other if they could. - Yeah? MAN: You boys gonna buy a fish or something? Nah. That's right, Rusty-James. These are Siamese fighting fish. Watch this. You know, if you lean a mirror... up against the glass... they try to kill themselves fighting their own reflection. - (BIRD SQUAWKING) - That's pretty cool. Yeah. Try it. - (DOG BARKING) - Right there. - In the middle. - Yeah. No, over that way. See that one over there? That one. Yeah. I wonder if they'd act that way in the river. I should close up now, boys. I don't carry much cash. Really I don't. Hey, we're lookin'. Wow. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, man, I really dig the colors. The colors? - RUSTY-JAMES: The colors are cool. - Mm-hmm. MOTORCYCLE BOY: Makes me kind of sorry I can't see the colors. RUSTY-JAMES: I never thought you were sorry about anything. What's the big interest in the pet store all of a sudden? - (BIRD SQUAWKING) - They've been hangin' around here. - Take a look at the fish. - (DOG BARKING) You're crazy. You're really crazy. And you know I've known about it all along. But they belong in the river. I don't think that they would fight if they were in the river, if they had the room to live. Someone oughta get you off the streets. Somebody oughta put the fish in the river.

It's great to see both of you again, huh? Yeah. Hey. I've been meaning to ask you something. Yes? Is our mother ‒ Is she crazy? Is she nuts? Huh? No, she's okay. I mean, uh, what-what makes you ask a question like that? Well, she just picked up and left, man. Yeah, well... - Rusty-James. - Mm-hmm? Every now and then, a person comes along that has a different view of the world than does the usual person. It doesn't make 'em crazy. I mean... an acute perception. I mean, that doesn't ‒ That doesn't make you crazy. - Could ‒ Could you talk normal? - But, however, sometimes... it can drive you crazy, an acute perception. I wish you would talk normal, 'cause... I don't ‒ I don't understand half the garbage you're saying. Uh, you know? You know what I mean? FATHER: No, your mother... was not crazy. And neither, contrary to popular belief, is your brother crazy. He's merely miscast in a play. He was born in the wrong era... on the wrong side of the river... with the ability to be able to do... anything that he wants to do and, uh... finding nothing that he wants to do. - I mean, nothin'. - Okay. You don't understand me anymore, do ya? It's for sure, for sure and actual. That's the difference. You never lost your mother. I lost your mother. I think ‒ I think that ‒ (CLEARS THROAT) ...I'm gonna be a lot like him when I grow ‒ when I get older. You should pray to God not. You poor baby. What? You poor child. - (COINS CLINK) - FATHER: Tab! (SIGHS) Hey, let's do something tonight, huh? Get some wine, get some chicks, party. You down? Man, I feel like I'm wastin' my life waiting for something. Waiting for what?

What? - Now, this is important, so pay attention. - Okay. Okay. I'm payin' attention. I want you to take the cycle... and I want you to leave. You got me? I want you to go clear to the ocean.
