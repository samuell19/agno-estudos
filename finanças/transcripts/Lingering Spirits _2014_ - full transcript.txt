"Lingering Spirits" ﻿Yumiko, call the marriage off. ﻿lt's not too late. ﻿What? I can't be held responsible. ﻿What's so great about... ﻿getting married in the first place? ﻿Kana. you've been married for five years. ﻿But it's not going well, is it? ﻿To be honest... ﻿I can't imagine living ﻿under the same roof with anyone... ﻿be it a wife or children. ﻿I'm happy just being with you. Sayuri. ﻿Are you all right? ﻿Yeah. I'm okay. It's not okay at all! ﻿Life insurance? Savings? ﻿Come on, we're just in our twenties! ﻿Living life for your kids? ﻿Man, that sounds positively dreary. ﻿But I wouldn't mind ﻿making a baby with you, Yoshimi. ﻿Right here. ﻿"How are you? —Mom" ﻿Ouch, it's hot! ﻿Welcome home. ﻿Here you go. ﻿Aren't you even going to greet me? ﻿l'm home. Mom. ﻿There's rice in the cooker. ﻿Just heat this up. ﻿Have your meal before cram school. ﻿—How have you been recently? ﻿—What do you mean? ﻿How's school? ﻿lt's fine. ﻿Good. ﻿That's thanks to your father. ﻿Okay, l'm off to work. ﻿I took my turn on our game. ﻿—Did you hear me? ﻿—Yeah. I did. ﻿—I'll be leaving then. ﻿—See you later. ﻿—I'll be leaving then. ﻿—See you later. ﻿—There's yoghurt in the fridge. ﻿Okay. ﻿—Good morning. ﻿—Good morning. ﻿—Yuko, guess what Kei did? ﻿—Shut up, Ruka. ﻿What is it now? ﻿Yeah? ﻿Really? I'll be right there. ﻿Sorry. ﻿My mom just died. ﻿Ruka, sighing drains away your happiness. ﻿I can't help it. ﻿It's my last day today. ﻿Don't you see it's my last day? ﻿So give it your best shot! It's the start of a new chapter for you. ﻿Greater happiness lies right ahead. ﻿But I love dancing. I'm going to miss you, ﻿and Yuko and everyone here. ﻿This sucks. ﻿Ruka. ﻿Be happy. ﻿I will! ﻿Are you ready, ladies? ﻿This will be Ruka's final performance. -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! ﻿Kanda, give me a heads-up next time. Sorry. It's $400 for arena seats ﻿and $3,000 for the front row seats. ﻿—One of those Korean acts? ﻿—Yeah. ﻿The place is teeming with rich old ladies. Looks like we'll make a bundle tonight. ﻿Gajiro, you're in your element. ﻿Exactly. ﻿Looking for tickets? It's $400 each. ﻿—Here you go. ﻿—Thank you. ﻿Enjoy the show! ﻿Sorry to have kept you waiting. ﻿Here. ﻿$2.000... ﻿$3,000. All here. ﻿You're the man. Gajiro. ﻿Here's your cut. ﻿—Thanks. ﻿—l'll call you again. ﻿—Give me some heads-up next time. ﻿-Why? ﻿You're free anyway, aren't you? ﻿By the way, don't you want to get a real job? ﻿No. this kind of work suits me better. ﻿See you. ﻿That was a blast! ﻿—It went really well today, didn't it? ﻿—Yes. it went really well. ﻿—Good job, everyone ﻿—Good job. ﻿Ruka. you were wonderful tonight. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿I feel bad, leaving everyone like this. ﻿Ruka. you did a great job! ﻿Jonny, thank you so much! ﻿-Tadah! ﻿-What? ﻿—What is this? ﻿—Congratulations. Ruka..! ﻿We put together a photo album ﻿of our times together. ﻿Really? You shouldn't have! ﻿And this is for you to keep photos ﻿of your lovely future ahead. ﻿Yuko. It has always been your dream to ﻿get married and start a family. ﻿Go live it. ﻿Thank you so much ﻿If you ever get lonely. ﻿come and visit us anytime. ﻿promise to visit. ﻿This is the best! Thanks...! ﻿Hey Mami. I just made some extra bucks. ﻿Let's grab a good dinner. ﻿"This is the highway traffic report." ﻿You're a traffic report junkie, Jonny. ﻿Yes. In today's world, information is power. I ﻿see. ﻿I can't wait to visit Ruka's hometown. It's freezing there, ﻿so please pack some warm clothes. ﻿I'm going to cry Iike a baby when ﻿I see you in your wedding dress, Ruka. ﻿Wait till you see the dress, Kei. It's so gorgeous you will weep. ﻿—Really? How is it like? ﻿—lt's an A-line skirt with frills to die for. ﻿That sounds awesome. ﻿You'll look stunning in it. ﻿After all, marriage is ﻿a once-in-a-lifetime experience. ﻿Actually, I've been married twice. ﻿What? ﻿Well, life rarely goes as expected. ﻿Yuko, will Kotaro be attending the wedding? ﻿Yes. He can skip a few days of cram school. ﻿That's great! ﻿I sure hope so. ﻿"Incoming call: Mom" ﻿"We're not home right now." ﻿"Please leave your name ﻿and message after the tone." ﻿Hello? It's Mommy. I'll be home in thirty minutes, okay? ﻿He probably fell asleep while studying. ﻿I guess so. I'll step on it then. ﻿—Sorry to trouble you. ﻿—No worries. ﻿"See you at school tomorrow. Good night." ﻿Youngsters these days... always texting away. ﻿Hey! No peeking! ﻿Oh. come on. ﻿Have you done it with him yet? ﻿What? Of course not! ﻿Why not? You fancy him. don't you? ﻿—We're not... ﻿—Ruka. ﻿Kei is a good girl. Stop teasing her. ﻿All right. ﻿Darn it. ﻿What was that just now? ﻿I think... that's us. ﻿What's going on? ﻿I don't know. ﻿"Morgue" ﻿Mr Honda, can you hear me? ﻿You were hit by a car and brought in here. ﻿I just have to run a few more tests... ﻿but on the whole, you're fine. Is that so? ﻿You have to thank your parents for ﻿giving you a strong physique. ﻿Okay. ﻿Let us now bid our farewells. ﻿Please put your hands together in prayer. ﻿Ruka! ﻿May I have a representative ﻿from each family step forward? ﻿Anyone? ﻿Please do the honours. ﻿Please press this button. ﻿Is that guy with the crew cut the one? ﻿Well, he's not exactly ﻿my boyfriend or anything. ﻿Well, he's cute. ﻿Yours not too shabby either, Ruka. ﻿Nice and brawny. ﻿Of course. ﻿He's the man I was going to marry. ﻿I am so sorry. This is all my fault. It's okay. Jonny. ﻿No. I am really sorry. ﻿We're dead. What's done is done. ﻿You're one lucky son-of-a-gun. ﻿Right? I must be a superhero ﻿or something to get away unscathed. ﻿What about them? ﻿-Who? ﻿—The people who hit you. ﻿I heard from the police ﻿that everyone in the car died. ﻿I see. That's unfortunate. ﻿Yeah, you're right. ﻿—Still, you can get compensation right? ﻿—Compensation? ﻿Compensation for hospitalisation ﻿and your medical fees. ﻿Hey, you're right! ﻿The deceased must have had families. ﻿Yes. I ﻿wonder if Kotaro is okay. ﻿What? ﻿I had no parents either. ﻿Neither did I. ﻿But look at me. I grew up fine by myself. ﻿Up until the accident anyway. I'm sure the authorities ﻿will take good care of Kotaro. ﻿But why are we the only ones like this? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I don't see any other spirits around. ﻿I know. Maybe we're not dead! ﻿We're most definitely dead. ﻿The living can't see us. ﻿They can't hear us ﻿no matter how loud we shout. ﻿Have we become lingering spirits? ﻿Lingering spirits? ﻿Spirits that remain in this world... ﻿unable to let go. I've heard of that! ﻿But that would make us... ﻿ghosts. ﻿Ghosts? ﻿What if we're doomed ﻿to wander the earth forever? ﻿—We'll probably see lots of scary stuff. ﻿—Don't say that. ﻿Like the dark side of humanity? ﻿That would really suck. ﻿Maybe it's not so bad. ﻿We can learn things about people ﻿we couldn't before. ﻿Doesn't that sound great? ﻿Give me a break. ﻿Kotaro, how are you holding up? I'm fine. ﻿Let's go to city hall and ﻿get you set up in foster care. ﻿That won't be necessary. ﻿I'm not going into foster care. ﻿You've lost both parents. ﻿Foster care is your only option now. ﻿I have a guardian, haven't I? ﻿What? ﻿Oh yes, that's correct. ﻿—He does? ﻿—Yes, he does. ﻿I'm sure you must be busy with work, ﻿so l'll just be going now. ﻿-But... ﻿—I shall take my leave then. ﻿A guardian? ﻿Kotaro. ﻿Kotaro. ﻿Lucky. ﻿That's his.. ﻿I forgot he can't hear me. ﻿Excuse me. Is this Sakura Cooperative Condominium? ﻿What? ﻿Yes, it is. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿Let's see... where's apartment 102? ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Yes? ﻿Can you see me? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿He can hear me. ﻿Can you hear me? ﻿Say what? ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Why are you ringing my doorbell? ﻿Are you Kasahara's next-of-kin? ﻿Yes. I am. ﻿I see. Allow me to convey my ﻿deepest condolences. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Actually, I'm the man ﻿hit by the car Kasahara was in. ﻿I see! So you've passed away too. ﻿No. but I racked up a hefty bill ﻿while I was hospitalised... ﻿so I was hoping to get some compensation ﻿to cover my expenses. ﻿You want money. ﻿Are you Kasahara Yuko's sister? ﻿-Yes? ﻿-Hello. ﻿Sorry, I was just chatting with your aunt. ﻿What? ﻿Sorry, but I didn't get your name. ﻿Please pardon my lack of manners. I'm Honda Gajiro. ﻿Are you alive? ﻿Yes. Wait... what do you mean by that? ﻿Sorry, but who are you talking to? I﻿sn't she your aunt? ﻿I see. We've got everything we need. ﻿What is he talking about? I'm Kasahara Yuko. ﻿Oh hello, Kasahara Yuko. ﻿-What? ﻿—Kasahara Yuko. ﻿I died in that car incident, thanks to you. ﻿—This is not funny. Please stop it. ﻿—I'm not joking. ﻿So what are you saying? You're dead? ﻿Yes. ﻿What the hell? ﻿Whatever. See you. ﻿-Hold it! ﻿—Not on your life. ﻿Maybe we're not ghosts. ﻿—Jonny! ﻿—Sorry. Are you okay? ﻿Did you just collide with this guy? ﻿Hey. watch it! ﻿He can see us. ﻿This is Mr Honda Gajiro. ﻿He's the guy who dashed out in front of ﻿our car and miraculously survived. ﻿For some reason, he's able to see us. ﻿What? What is it? ﻿What? What do you want...? ﻿Please... give me a break. ﻿I'm afraid you're all we have to rely on. ﻿I'm really sorry for what happened! ﻿So I beg of you. Please disappear! If only we could. ﻿Unfortunately, we're stranded. ﻿Perhaps Fate has brought us ﻿together for a reason. ﻿Fate? Or jinx? Oh. whatever. ﻿Do as you like. ﻿—What are you doing? ﻿—l'm taking a bath. ﻿But we're not done talking. ﻿A bath? ﻿I wish I could take one too. ﻿Baths are so relaxing. ﻿-What? ﻿—We're dead. ﻿So we can't touch anything ﻿or anyone, except you. ﻿That's not my problem. ﻿And we don't get hungry or sleepy. ﻿How convenient. ﻿Not at all. There's no fun in it. ﻿I think it's your duty ﻿to fulfil our wishes for us. ﻿—Okay, I'll take a bath then. ﻿—I don't mean that. ﻿Then what? ﻿She was about to get married. ﻿Yeah, so? ﻿You're a douche. ﻿My lifelong dream was to have a wedding. ﻿—Right. The dream of all women. ﻿—That's why I can't give up on it. ﻿Ever since I was a little girl, ﻿I had been telling myself... ﻿one day, I would wear a wedding gown, ﻿get married in a church... ﻿and live happily ever after. ﻿I had every detail planned. ﻿Down to the design of my tiara ﻿and the flowers for my bridal bouquet... ﻿How interesting. I'll pay you for it! I'll pay you if you hold my wedding ceremony. ﻿But you're dead. ﻿I know that. ﻿But I still want a wedding. ﻿Figure something out. ﻿—You owe us that much. ﻿—I ﻿owe you? ﻿You hit me with a car! ﻿$70,000! ﻿I have $70,000. ﻿You don't say. ﻿You can't be serious. ﻿That douchebag doesn't deserve ﻿to have all your savings. ﻿—It's a deal, I'll help you. ﻿—Really? ﻿But first, show me the money. ﻿Hey, nice digs. ﻿It belongs to the club. ﻿Ouch! ﻿"Commendation of Service ﻿Kawasaki Fire Department" ﻿Open the cabinet. ﻿Wow, monogrammed safes! ﻿Well, the world is a dangerous place. ﻿There's $70,000 in my safe. ﻿Really? ﻿My code is one-two-three-four-hash. ﻿—That simple? ﻿—Try it out. ﻿You weren't kidding! ﻿Ouch! ﻿—Do you believe us now? ﻿—You didn't have to kick me. ﻿So are you in or out? ﻿Of course I'm in. ﻿Money-grubber. ﻿You're pretty young to have so much savings. It was for my future. ﻿For your future, huh? ﻿By the way. how are all of you related? ﻿We had a professional relationship. ﻿—Were you colleagues? ﻿—We were pole dancers! ﻿What's that? ﻿One. two. three, four. five. six. seven, eight. ﻿Oh. strippers! ﻿No! ﻿—Fine. ﻿—lt's not fine. ﻿So I just need to hold your wedding ﻿and all that money is mine? ﻿-Yes! ﻿—Let's do it then. ﻿Yes! It's freezing. ﻿No, it's not. ﻿Of course it isn't for you. You're dead! ﻿Wait... you are cold, aren't you? ﻿Not in the least. ﻿There! That's my fiance's house! ﻿Watch it! ﻿In short, she wants to go ahead ﻿with the wedding ceremony. ﻿I don't see how we can. ﻿Ruka is no longer with us. ﻿What nonsense, Please leave. ﻿You're absolutely right. ﻿Was it Ruka? ﻿Did Ruka tell you she wants to ﻿go ahead with the wedding? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I know it sounds crazy. ﻿I don't believe this! ﻿I can't believe Ruka is dead! Is Ruka here with us now? ﻿Actually... yeah. If this is what Ruka wants... ﻿let's have a wedding! ﻿Don't be silly. Tatsuo! ﻿—Tatsuo! ﻿—You're agreeing to it? ﻿Yes. ﻿Tatsuo! ﻿How do we hold a wedding without a bride? ﻿Ask Ruka. ﻿Ask how she wants it done. I'll need a stand-in... ﻿for the bride. ﻿You do it, Gajiro. ﻿What? ﻿﻿Let us welcome the bride. ﻿$70,000. $70,000... ﻿$70,000, $70,000... ﻿$70,000, $70,000... ﻿$70,000, $70,000... ﻿$70,000, $70,000... ﻿$70,000. $70,000... ﻿$70,000. $70,000... ﻿$70,000, $70,000... ﻿$70,000, $70,000... ﻿Do you, Oguro Tatsuo... ﻿take this woman. Maruyama Ruka. ﻿to be your lawfully wedded wife... ﻿for better or for worse, ﻿in sickness and in health... ﻿so long as you both shall live? ﻿—I do. ﻿—She's dead though. ﻿Ouch! ﻿Do you, Maruyama Ruka... ﻿take this man. Oguro Tatsuo. ﻿to be your lawfully wedded husband... ﻿for better or for worse. ﻿in sickness and in health... ﻿so long as you both shall live? ﻿I do. ﻿She's dead, but she does. ﻿The bride and the groom ﻿may now exchange rings. It won't fit, so try the pinkie. ﻿I feel sick. ﻿You may now kiss the bride. ﻿Surely we can skip that part. ﻿You're right. We shall omit that. ﻿What does Ruka want? ﻿What? What does Ruka want? I... I ﻿want to kiss the groom. ﻿—Oh. come on. That'd be too darn weird. ﻿—I ﻿can only rely on you! ﻿You're all that I can touch. ﻿I'm dead. That's why... ﻿as much as I would like ﻿to embrace and kiss Tatsuo... ﻿I can't do it. ﻿But... I want to kiss him. ﻿I don't care how. ﻿I want to kiss him. ﻿even if it's just indirectly. ﻿I want to feel him once more. ﻿"Even if it's just indirectly"? ﻿Listen to yourself. ﻿That's just like what Ruka would say. ﻿Mr Gajiro, pardon me. ﻿What? No! ﻿Wait! ﻿Wait! ﻿Ruka? ﻿Tatsuo. ﻿How could you leave me like that? ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿But l'm glad it's you. ﻿l'm so happy we can still get married. ﻿You're always doing crazy stuff. It's why you love me, right? ﻿I love you. Me too. ﻿I love you. Tatsuo. ﻿Ruka? ﻿Ruka! I... can't breathe. ﻿Oh, sorry. ﻿Mr Gajiro. ﻿What is it now? ﻿Thank you for bringing Ruka to me. ﻿Hey. ﻿Where did she go? ﻿What happened? ﻿Ruka must have gone on to Heaven. ﻿I guess she's satisfied she got her wedding. ﻿It's not about satisfaction. It sure is. Her lifelong dream ﻿was to have a wedding. ﻿She said so herself. ﻿Well, she had a more fulfilling life ﻿than you do. ﻿Ruka sure looked beautiful. ﻿She was gorgeous. ﻿Ruka would yell at me for saying this... ﻿but I've never seen her look so radiant. ﻿She was practically glowing. ﻿She looked so happy ﻿it made me feel envious. ﻿Well, now that Ruka's wish ﻿has been fulfilled... ﻿what about the money as promised? ﻿Yes, of course. ﻿You're so mercenary. ﻿I get that a lot. ﻿Sour grapes. ﻿What about the two of you? ﻿Excuse me? Is there anything I can do for you? I'm not sure... ﻿I don't need any help. ﻿—Are you certain? ﻿—Positive. ﻿—Jonny? ﻿—Yes. ﻿How much money is there in your safe? ﻿—You're curious? ﻿—Of course. ﻿Well, this is embarrassing, but.. ﻿$200,000. ﻿You're loaded! ﻿You can't live on your own. ﻿Kotaro? ﻿Hey, still alive? ﻿Manager? ﻿—Here you go. ﻿—Thanks again. It's the least I can do. ﻿Thank you for your concern. ﻿but I'm fine, really. ﻿You're as stubborn as your mother. ﻿But maybe it's time you go into foster care. ﻿—It's okay. ﻿—It's not okay. ﻿At least move to Jonny's place. ﻿It's vacant and rent-free. I'll pass. I don't wish to transfer school. ﻿How long can you live like this? ﻿For as long as I can. ﻿—How are you going to support yourself? ﻿—Mom had savings. ﻿All right, make a go of it then. ﻿Just call me if you need help. ﻿—You should have caught that! ﻿—All right, one more time! ﻿Are you really paying me five grand ﻿a month for three hours of work a day? ﻿That's awesome. ﻿But you need to make a daily report. ﻿A report? ﻿Yes. ﻿Please pull over here. ﻿Okay. ﻿Hey. ﻿Gajiro, can you move this bicycle away for me? ﻿"Fire hydrant" ﻿Move it. ﻿Why are you still coming to school? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Your mom's dead. Go into foster care ﻿and transfer school already. ﻿—What's with these little brats? ﻿—That's none of your business. ﻿-Hold it. ﻿—Let go of me. ﻿—Come here... ﻿—Cut it out. boys! ﻿—Let me go. ﻿—Where do you think you're going? ﻿Stop it! I said, stop it! ﻿Ouch! ﻿I heard your mom danced naked for money. ﻿So what if she did? ﻿So get lost! ﻿Get lost! Get out of my sight! ﻿Kotaro... ﻿Oh man, this is such a pain. ﻿You mean here...and here? ﻿Yes. That will do. ﻿And what do we do with this? ﻿Take it over there. ﻿The fire department? ﻿Please hand the map ﻿to a mechanic called Kanda. ﻿Why? It's the three Rs. ﻿(Report, relay, review). ﻿-What? ﻿—Just hand over the report. ﻿You're Miss Miyoshi, right? Is Mr Kanda, the mechanic, about? ﻿I'm sorry. You are? ﻿—I'm Honda. ﻿—Hold on, Mr Honda. ﻿—It's Myochin. ﻿—What's that? ﻿My surname. ﻿Are you Mr Honda? ﻿Myochin, actually. I ﻿mean I'm a relative of Myochin's. I ﻿see. Please accept my condolences. I'm Kanda. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I was told to give this to you. ﻿—What is this? ﻿—The three Rs! ﻿-What? ﻿—A report. ﻿—My will. ﻿—It was in his will. I ﻿see. Thank you. I﻿'ll be bringing more in ﻿over the next three months. ﻿—Three months? ﻿—Yes. ﻿That's the terms of my contract... ﻿I mean, the will. ﻿What's that map for? It contains very important information. ﻿You sure are a busy man. ﻿The three Rs are ﻿a crucial paradigm for our work. ﻿—It stand for report, relay and... ﻿—All right, good night. ﻿Oh... okay. Good night. ﻿There's nothing like a cold can of beer ﻿after a hard day's work. ﻿Don't just show up like that! I'm sorry, but this is an emergency. ﻿This is an invasion of privacy! ﻿You're the only one we can turn to. I'm going to bed. ﻿-Wait. ﻿—No, I won't. ﻿What is it now? I need a favour. ﻿What is it? I'd like you to help my son. ﻿What? ﻿His father died when he was still little... ﻿and now I'm gone too. ﻿He's living by himself. ﻿He's just in grade school, ﻿he should be foster care. ﻿But he insists on living by himself. Is that so? ﻿—So we would like you to... ﻿—How much are you paying me? ﻿In that case, good night. ﻿Hold it... how does $50,000 sound? ﻿-$50,000? ﻿—I'll shorten our contract by a month. ﻿—Jonny... ﻿—It's okay. ﻿What do you think? ﻿For $50,000. I suppose I can do it. I ﻿remember you from the other day. ﻿Not so fast. ﻿What do you want? I'll call the cops. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿You'll be the one in trouble. ﻿No. I won't. ﻿Wait... ﻿Will you please stop bothering me? ﻿You live alone. ﻿—Yeah, what of it? ﻿—Go into foster care. ﻿—You work for them? ﻿-No. ﻿Then what is it to you where I live? ﻿I guess you can say... I represent your mom. ﻿My mom's gone. ﻿And I'm not obliged to entertain strangers. ﻿Get it? Now. please leave. ﻿What the...? ﻿Open up. you little brat! ﻿Calm down. Take it easy. ﻿—What was that? ﻿-What? ﻿Couldn't you at least be more mature ﻿in front of a child? ﻿You should be examining yourself ﻿for raising a brat like him. ﻿Fine.. I've had enough. I'm out of here. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Oh, Mr Gaji! ﻿"Mr Gaji"? ﻿So you were the manager ﻿for your school's baseball team. ﻿By the way, how old are you? ﻿l'm seventeen. ﻿So you were a high school student? ﻿Yes. Do I look older? ﻿No. but you were a pole dancer, right? ﻿I had to work at night to make ends meet. ﻿I see. ﻿But I was an ordinary student by day. ﻿Ordinary, huh? ﻿Well, maybe not so ordinary. ﻿You do have something ﻿can help you with, right? Maybe. ﻿He's the captain of the baseball club. ﻿I don't think they were dating. ﻿but they were very close. ﻿You know, texting each other daily and all. ﻿How innocent. ﻿We live in a very convenient age. ﻿You can contact anyone ﻿on your cell phone anytime. ﻿Unlike back in my day. ﻿"Turn left at the traffic light ﻿one hundred metres ahead." ﻿What? Turning left will on ﻿take us the long way. ﻿Just go straight. ﻿—"Please turn left." ﻿—I'm telling you... ﻿I hear you. ﻿We have GPS navigation now, ﻿is it worth the effort making a map? ﻿Reporting is important work. ﻿Work, huh? I﻿'m counting on you to help Kotaro. ﻿That's work too. ﻿That little brat. ﻿—Thanks again. ﻿—Don't mention it. It's my job... I ﻿mean, his will. ﻿Do you have a minute? ﻿Sure. ﻿Please come with me. ﻿We are really indebted to Mr Myochin. ﻿He delivered these maps to help us with ﻿our work even in his retirement. ﻿Wow! This is awesome! ﻿This is our information hub ﻿which is constantly being updated. ﻿This AVM system keeps track of information... ﻿such as traffic conditions, ﻿ movement of mobilised vehicles... ﻿fire hydrant locations and building details. ﻿I see. ﻿Mr Myochin's passion for this job... ﻿has greatly inspired and motivated us. ﻿However, to date... ﻿these maps have not been of any use to us... ﻿not even once. ﻿I appreciate his kind intentions... ﻿but I can't impose on you any further ﻿because of his will. ﻿Are you saying... ﻿these maps are redundant? ﻿Yes. ﻿Jonny is still alive. ﻿What? ﻿Just kidding. I ﻿see. ﻿How did it go? ﻿We'll bring another map tomorrow. —Jonny. ﻿—Yes? ﻿—Let's not do this anymore. ﻿-What? ﻿He said what you're paying me ﻿to do is redundant. ﻿What are you talking about? It's important... It's not important at all! ﻿See you. ﻿What are you doing here? I ﻿came to ask you for a favour. ﻿A letter? Why not an email or a text? ﻿I want to convey my feelings ﻿in a more tangible way. ﻿Do you have money? ﻿-$20,000. ﻿—No joke! ﻿You can have it. ﻿I have no use for it anyway. ﻿See, you know how the world works. ﻿Unlike the other two. ﻿Did something happen? ﻿Where do I even begin? ﻿Convincing a stubborn, snot-nosed ﻿brat to go into foster care. ﻿Doing work that is utterly redundant. ﻿It's beyond my comprehension. ﻿Kotaro. I know you're home. ﻿Please open the door. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿Oh, I'm from social services. ﻿I'm here to talk to the boy. ﻿You're from foster care? Perfect timing... ﻿Ouch, that hurts! ﻿—Say you're his guardian. ﻿-What? ﻿—His guardian! ﻿—And you are? ﻿I'm the boy's guardian. ﻿You're his guardian? ﻿Yes. ﻿Open the door, Kotaro. It's your uncle. ﻿Thank you for coming. ﻿Don't mention it. He will be having ﻿his retirement match today. It's today? ﻿What a pigsty. ﻿Oh, it's The Game of Life. ﻿What do you want? ﻿Have you been going to school? ﻿I can study on my own ﻿without going to school. ﻿Can you? ﻿Mr Gaji. ﻿Let's go to a baseball game. ﻿Why? ﻿What do you mean why? ﻿Kotaro likes high-school baseball. ﻿I heard you like high-school baseball. ﻿Your mom says so. ﻿Come on. Let's go. ﻿—Let go of me. ﻿—Shut up. ﻿You're such a pain. ﻿Come on! ﻿This was Kei's high school. ﻿So what? ﻿Kei asked me to come here. ﻿What? ﻿Mr Gaji, he's the one in ﻿jersey number one over there. ﻿Captain! ﻿Here, it's from Kei. ﻿Kei? You mean Inuzuka Kei? ﻿Yes. You're Fujiwara Ryo, aren't you? ﻿We're talking about the Inuzuka Kei ﻿who passed away, right? ﻿Yeah, but she's right here. ﻿What? ﻿She's here to watch your final match. ﻿Very funny. ﻿Mr Gaji. ﻿What did you expect? ﻿Good luck! ﻿Oh, the exuberance of youth. ﻿Yes. ﻿﻿And it's just the beginning for Kotaro. ﻿Really? That cantankerous brat? ﻿-What? ﻿—Of course. ﻿Is baseball really that interesting? ﻿—Of course, it is. ﻿—Of course, it is. ﻿Although I'm just a spectator... ﻿I think it's wonderful ﻿to give your all for something. Is that what it's about? ﻿Yes! ﻿Captain, go for it! Win or lose, this is the last game ﻿for the third-year seniors. ﻿Go. Fujiwara! ﻿He can't hear you. ﻿Even if her voice can't reach him... ﻿her feelings will. That's what matters. ﻿I guess her feelings ﻿didn't reach him after all. ﻿Shut up. ﻿Do you think it's Kotaro's pride... ﻿that's keeping him ﻿from going into foster care? ﻿—Is it your ego? ﻿-What? ﻿Why won't you go into foster care? ﻿What does it matter? ﻿You're just a child and ﻿you can't possibly take care of yourself. ﻿—Your mom said so. ﻿—I did not. ﻿She's sitting right next to you. ﻿No, she's not. ﻿Baseball requires team work. ﻿That's obvious. ﻿You exist because of those around you. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿Kotaro probably doesn't understand that yet. ﻿Since he's all alone now. ﻿Yeah. ﻿"Dear Ryo." ﻿"I'm sorry for leaving so abruptly." ﻿"Thank you for everything." ﻿"Yours, Inuzuka Kei." ﻿"Teiko High: Three ﻿Kirisato High: Nil" ﻿Hit it out of here. Ryo! ﻿It's your last match! ﻿Show them the result ﻿of three years of hard work! ﻿Ryo! ﻿Blast that ball! ﻿Fujiwara! ﻿Inuzuka Kei is right here! ﻿Kei is watching, so give it your best shot! ﻿Strike! ﻿Swing at it, Fujiwara! ﻿You idiot, I'm telling you! ﻿Inuzuka Kei is watching! ﻿So put your best foot forward for her! ﻿Quit whining... ﻿Zip it! ﻿I got it, okay? ﻿Shut up and watch! ﻿Run! ﻿Run...! ﻿Go! ﻿Ryo! ﻿Run! ﻿Visiting team, Teiko. wins 3-2. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿Third-year seniors, gather around. ﻿Shall we go? ﻿Wait. ﻿What is it? ﻿Inuzuka Kei is here, isn't she? ﻿Yeah, she is. ﻿She is right here. ﻿Here. ﻿Inuzuka! ﻿Yes. ﻿Thank you for the past three years. ﻿We couldn't have done it... ﻿without your support! ﻿Thank you very much...! ﻿We'll all be going our separate ways... ﻿but we'll be friends forever. ﻿We'll always be on your side. ﻿You'll never be alone! ﻿Thank you... ﻿for everything. ﻿What? Why? ﻿Wait a second! ﻿-What? ﻿—You like him, don't you? ﻿You can borrow my body! ﻿Mr Gaji. ﻿It's all right. ﻿I'm contented. I'm happy I got to see everyone. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Hey, Kotaro. ﻿You saw Kei, didn't you? ﻿Of course not. ﻿Fine. ﻿What about my mom? ﻿Is my mom dead? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I see.

It's okay. Take the next right turn. ﻿Seriously, what's wrong with this guy? ﻿—Have you isolated the problem? ﻿—An error has occurred... ﻿with our lntelligent Transport System. ﻿This is 119. ls there a fire outbreak ﻿or do you need an ambulance? ﻿There's a fire at a factory in ﻿Misakicho, Kawasaki. ﻿"Fire alert!

Where's the fire? ﻿I'm a little busy right now. ﻿It's Jonny who is asking, not me. ﻿I mean, Mr Myochin. ﻿This is no time for jokes. ﻿I'm not joking. ﻿Jonny is still alive. ﻿Reporting! ﻿Say what? ﻿—Just repeat after me. ﻿Reporting! ﻿Reporting! ﻿Yes. ﻿There's traffic congestion ﻿due to a signal malfunction ahead. ﻿Turn around and take ﻿Kawahara Road to your right. ﻿Kanda here. The fire is near Kawasaki ﻿Stadium at Misakicho, Futabaku. ﻿He said fire is near Kawasaki Stadium ﻿at Misakicho. Futabaku. Understood. ﻿Proceed from 3 Kawahara Street ﻿via Kyutaishi instead of Kawahara Road. ﻿The shortcut would be to proceed from ﻿3 Kawahara Street via Kyutaishi.. ﻿instead of Kawahara Road. ﻿Kyutaishi, right? ﻿This is the three Rs. isn't it? ﻿I'll lead the way. ﻿Myochin will lead the way. ﻿Copy that. We'll follow. ﻿"This is Rinkai One paging for ﻿Kawasaki Fire Brigade." ﻿Permission to take alternative route ﻿via Kyutaishi due to road congestion.

Please help me find him. ﻿—Find him? ﻿—He took off when I wasn't looking. ﻿Where could he have gone at this hour? ﻿What about my mom? Is my mom dead? ﻿—Oh no... ﻿—What do you mean? ﻿Anyway, let's start looking. ﻿Ouch, that hurts! ﻿I told you! I need you ﻿to look for a fifth-grade boy. ﻿—You need to fill out an application form... ﻿—A child's life is on the line! ﻿—May I have your name? ﻿—Who cares about my name? ﻿—I need it to file a report... ﻿—To hell with your bloody report! ﻿Hold it right there! ﻿"Fifth Grade Mathematics" ﻿Now, throw it! ﻿That's six. ﻿—Let's try for thirty. ﻿—Thirty? Okay. ﻿Hey! ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I'm making a bonfire. ﻿That's a lot of textbooks. ﻿May I join you? ﻿The bonfire. ﻿Do you have to study all these? ﻿I'd want to burn it too, if I were you. ﻿Don't try to be all buddy-buddy with me. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿I'm done with it. ﻿Done with what? I'm done with studying. I've lost my goal in life. ﻿At age ten? ﻿A little early, don't you think? ﻿I was going to get into Tokyo University ﻿and get a high-paying job. ﻿So Mom could quit her job. That was the plan. ﻿But then she went and died on me. ﻿She did that kind of work to raise me. ﻿What do you mean "that kind of work"? ﻿Dancing naked in front of people for money. ﻿No, it was respectable work. ﻿—As for the naked part... ﻿—What do you know? ﻿What do you know about her job? ﻿-Well... ﻿—You don't know anything. ﻿Nobody understands how it feels. ﻿Having to do that sort of thing ﻿to make a living. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Well, you're the only one left. I ﻿see. ﻿—So Jonny has left too. ﻿—It was really cool. ﻿People were saluting him like this. ﻿Sorry... ﻿but l'm not going anywhere. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿I can't leave Kotaro alone by himself. ﻿I understand, but... ﻿Although I can't help him... ﻿I'm duty-bound to stay by his side. ﻿But you can't do anything without me. ﻿I don't have any money to offer you. ﻿So you don't have to bother ﻿about us anymore. ﻿Is that right? ﻿Yes. ﻿See you then. ﻿—What? My turn, already? ﻿—Yeah. ﻿Here I go. ﻿Two. ﻿You? Pole dancing? I ﻿want to be a pole dancer. ﻿Do you have any experience in dancing? ﻿No. ﻿None at all? ﻿I have money. ﻿Can I rent this place? ﻿One. two. three, four, five, six, seven, eight. ﻿Two. two, three, four, five, six. ﻿Come on, you can do better than that. ﻿Ouch, that hurts...! ﻿—One... that's wrong! ﻿—Ouch! ﻿Keep your legs together. ﻿—Sorry. ﻿—Let's take it from the top. ﻿One. two. three. four. five. six. seven. eight... One! ﻿Ouch! That hurts! ﻿All right. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Two, three, four, five, six. seven, eight. ﻿One. two. three, four. five. six. seven, eight. ﻿One. two. three. four. five. six. seven. eight. ﻿One. two. three. four. five. six. seven. eight. ﻿Gajiro? ﻿Kanta! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿What does it look like? I'm practising. ﻿—Practising? ﻿—That's right. I'm practising to be a pole dancer. ﻿Pole dancer? ﻿Yes. ﻿One. two. three, four... ﻿Five, six. seven, eight. ﻿You're not moving your hips at all. ﻿Move your hips. ﻿—Okay. ﻿—Again. ﻿Yes. ﻿—Work those hips. ﻿—Yes. ﻿Let's go. ﻿One, two. three, four, five.. ﻿Make it sexier! Sexier! ﻿Hey. ﻿Don't scare me like that! ﻿What's this? ﻿Oh, I heard this is good for losing weight. ﻿What are you doing here? I'm here to say goodbye. ﻿What do you mean by that? ﻿Kotaro is going into foster care. ﻿So I'm sure we won't be ﻿seeing each other again. ﻿You mean... ﻿Thank you for taking the trouble. ﻿You're welcome. ﻿—Actually... ﻿—Well then. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿Goodbye! ﻿Thank you very much! ﻿Kotaro. I've got something to show you ﻿before you leave. I'm sorry, but... It's something he has been dying to see. ﻿Come and watch me pole dance. ﻿What the heck are you saying? ﻿What's this about? ﻿You want to see what ﻿pole dancing is like, don't you? ﻿He doesn't. ﻿You can have this if you come with me. ﻿To where your mom used to work. ﻿—No. ﻿—Don't be such a spoilsport. ﻿—Let's go! ﻿—I'm not going! ﻿—Put me down! ﻿-Wait...! ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿Can you even pole dance? ﻿I'll manage. ﻿Look, just forget it. ﻿What will this prove? ﻿Kotaro seems to have gotten the wrong idea. ﻿—About? ﻿—Pole dancing. ﻿That doesn't mean you have to pole dance. I ﻿want to feel him once more. ﻿I think it's wonderful ﻿to give your all for something. It feels great to pull off one last job. I'll show him. ﻿One job is just as respectable as the next. ﻿Listen... ﻿Hurry, Gajiro. You're up next. ﻿Roger that! ﻿Wait a second! ﻿Quiet! ﻿Pathetic. Mom... ﻿You call yourself a pole dancer with ﻿moves like that? Lame. ﻿Shut up. ﻿That was cool. ﻿Pole dancing. ﻿Yeah? ﻿Right? Mom... ﻿your pole dancing was cool. ﻿Kotaro... ﻿Can you see her? ﻿All this time.. ﻿was hoping you'd come back. ﻿I see. I'm sorry I didn't answer when you called. ﻿I'm sorry I was so difficuIt. ﻿But I'm going to do my best. I'll do my best for the both of us. I'll live a good life. ﻿So... ﻿just watch over me. I'll make you proud. ﻿Okay. ﻿You do that, Kotaro. Mom! ﻿Kotaro... ﻿No. ﻿Don't go... ﻿Don't go! ﻿Not if I can help it. ﻿Gajiro. Mom! Mom! ﻿Hey, Gajiro. It's "Mr Gajiro" to you. ﻿Mom is sitting in the back. ﻿Knock it off. You little brat. ﻿Hello. ﻿—I'm Kasahara Kotaro. Nice to meet you. ﻿—Nice to meet you. ﻿I'm the guardian... ﻿Is the person-in-charge inside? ﻿Yes. ﻿Quite a mature boy you have there. ﻿He's putting on a brave front. ﻿You seem to know him well. ﻿No, kids are a mystery. ﻿Perhaps I should ﻿get your number, just in case. ﻿—My number? ﻿—Yes. ﻿Hey Gaji, stop hitting on girls. ﻿Come on, give me something ﻿to look forward to. ﻿Hello. ﻿Shiori, look. ﻿The flowers have blossomed. ﻿—You're right. They are in full bloom. ﻿—Aren't they pretty? ﻿I think we picked the right place. ﻿What should my next move be? ﻿My boy, you have a lot to learn. ﻿That bird!
