There. My inter-dimensional portal update is done, and I couldn't have done it without the help of my two best friends. Mmm! New portal smell. You think the three of us will still be best friends when we're grown up? Sure, Carl, we're a team, like the Three Musketeers or Feldman, Krauser, and McDipple. Yeah, we're always... Who are Feldman, Krauser, and McDipple? Inventors of open-air satellite communication. I want to be Feldman. No way! How come you're always Feldman? I've never been Feldman. You're McDipple! Guys, guys! The point is that we're best friends. Nothing's going to ever change that. Now, let's see what our neighboring dimensions are up to. There are the jelly people of Riegis Five. Hmm? There are the Yokians. Hey, there's Timmy Turner. Ah, what a day! Tailor-made for hanging out with my good friends, all both of them. ( grunting ) Chester, my man. What do you say you and me throw the old pill around? Sorry, dude, it's Fridge Friday. My dad's making me move this refrigerator off the lawn to make room for our new outhouse I just built. ♪ Oh, the Camptown ladies sing this song... ♪ Well, Chester's out, but A.J. has a working indoor toilet. I'll bet he's free. A.J.: I'm not free, Timmy. Actually, Timmy, I'm free-zing... myself. What?! I'm sick of being the only genius in town... so I'm placing myself in suspended animation until the 24th century, where, if I'm right, mankind will be so far advanced, I'll be welcomed like a long-lost brother. That's insane! Of course, you'd think that. You're so 21st century. Good-bye, primitive! ( screaming ) Ah, don't worry, Timmy. You've got us. Yeah, we're forced to hang out with you. Those guys are practically my only friends in this universe. You know what that means? You should be a better person? Nope. You should play with Sanjay and Elmer? Nope. Time to try another universe. Next up, Retroville and Cindy Vortex. Nope-- oh, wait. Sorry. Cindy? He's coming to see Cindy?! Excuse me, guys. Hey, Jimmy, wait up! Yeah, we want to watch the violence. ( both grunting ) Neutron? I was just coming to see Cindy. Not if I see her first! What? Hey! Give it up, incisor boy. Cindy likes me best. No way, Brainzilla! I'm Cindy's love puppet. I'd love to stay and chat, but my flight's departing. Huh? I wish I had a jetpack, too. You know, he could have just wished himself to Cindy's first. Yeah, he's not really that bright, is he? Ya-hoo! ( both grunting ) You don't have a hope, Turner! Oh. They're flying and hitting each other. Oh, that looks like fun. ( grunts ) Hey, you're right, it is. You're going down, Turner. You're going down, Neutron. Actually, you're both going down. ( both screaming ) May I help you? Is Cindy home? Is Cindy home? The Vortex family is on a spa retreat until next week. Good day. So, want to hang out? Hang out? Are you nuts? Have you gone completely mental? You want to hang out with me, the two of us together? Uh, maybe. Okay, sure. That didn't work out the way we had hoped. Jimmy and Timmy are friends? Do you know what this means? Do you? Do you? Uh, why are you talking to me like that? ( big band music begins ) ♪ Timmy is an average kid that no one understands... ♪ ( explosion ) ♪ From here to the stars, fueled by candy bars ♪ ♪ Rides a kid with a knack for invention... ♪ ( croaks ) ♪ It flips your lid when you're the kid with fairly odd... ♪ ♪ With a super-powered mind, a mechanical canine... ♪ ( oinks ) ( cheering ) Captioning sponsored by MTV TELEVISION NETWORKS So here's what I'm thinking. We get in that robo- walking thing of yours, go out, and crash into stuff. Too dangerous. Hey, how about we break luminous compounds down into their base elements? I'm not sure what you just said, so I'm gonna assume it's boring. Look, let's compromise-- why don't we use my new portal to go up to Riegis Five... Yeah? ...find us some jelly people... Like where this going. ...then, take scrapings from their flagella and bring them back for analysis? You had me, and you lost me. Turner, let's face it. You and I just aren't friends like me, Carl, and Sheen. Maybe we're not meant to hang out. ( alarm beeping ) ( gasps ) Eustace Strych! And he's coming this way! What the heck's a Eustace Strych?! I know! I got it once from eating bad clams, but then I threw up, and I felt much better. He's not an allergic reaction. He's the town's richest kid. He'd be a joke if he didn't pay a team of scientists to help him with his evil plans. Stay here. Oh, this'll be great! We could use this time to read and practice sharing. You thinking what I'm thinking? Come on! He couldn't have gotten far! ( Timmy laughing ) Being grounded for trying to smash Neutron made me want to be better. Better at smashing Neutron. ( laughs ) I love the robo-walker. Let's start crashing into stuff. Hold it right there, Eustace. James, dear boy, so good to see you again. You remember my tripod ship and the fear it creates! I'm not afraid of your stupid ship. Oh. Well, how about now?! My controls are frozen. Raise goop launcher. Oh, no! Jimmy's in trouble. Timmy, do something! I wish Neutron's controls worked again. Thanks, Turner. Okay, Eustace, let's dance. So when we heard that Cindy was away, we realized you needed friends and fast. Yeah, so we're here for you, whether you want us here or not. Well, thanks, you guys, but you really don't have to. Sheen, look! Isn't that the robo-walker? They need our help! Come on! ( both grunting ) ( both gasping ) ( whistling ) Okay, Timmy, just like we planned. Right. I wish the tripod ship was stuck in quicksand. ( Eustace groaning ) Setting phasers to butt whoop. Oh, dear. Quick, break my fall. Don't worry, guys, we'll save you. Actually, Neutron and I pretty much have it covered. Yeah, we're having a great time. Okay, Timmy, let him run, then we'll catch him and kick his butt some more. Sweet! I wish the quicksand was gone. ( Jimmy and Timmy laughing ) Wow. Jimmy doesn't need us at all. Yeah, it's like Timmy's Feldman and McDipple all wrapped up in one. That makes him McFeldipple. I hate you, McFeldipple! TIMMY: Wow, that was awesome! I can't believe you used science to transmute his gasoline into sugar water, deactivate his missiles, and give him chicken pox. And I can't believe you used Cosmo and Wanda to fill his cockpit with bees, turn his assistant into a pig, and fill his shorts with hot fudge. I can still feel the burns! JIMMY: That was almost too easy. Want to try something harder, like battling some of my enemies, one of my super- powered enemies? Sure, I've got a few minutes. Cosmo, Wanda, let's play. Oh, sure, I might have had to ignore Timmy to build my pop a new place to poop, but I'm sure it's nothing that a little candy and flowers can't fix. Man, that was awesome. Next time, we get to use the porta-portal, right? You got it, new best friend. New best friend? I'm being replaced? I've got to find A.J.! Well, good-bye, 21st century, with your wars, pestilence, and frozen espresso drinks. When I wake, all of those horrible things will be a distant memory. A.J., wake up! ( screams ) Timmy has a new friend! Wow, I'm in the future already, and you're here, too. Ahem, didn't you hear me? Timmy has a new friend! There's no Timmy in the 24th century. Unless... society must have advanced so much that all of this familiar stuff is how my mind is processing it, so I can understand it. This room isn't actually my room. It's probably a room so advanced, my mind is processing the images so it looks like my room, which means you're not actually Chester. ( screams ) Come on! I'll never understand how you're able to do that. And I'll never tell you. But we can't be fighting crime like this. I wish I was... ...with my faithful sidekicks, Ace and Clefto, the chin hounds. Dude, you got to jazz it up. Right! And I'd very much like to be... Super kid genius. Now you're talking. Come on, let's go pound some super-villains. Oh, no! The Chin is hurt! Surrender, Cleft, Ace, Clefto... Uh, what's your name again? Brain Boy! Brain Boy? You brought some sort of souped-up nerd to fight me? Give it up, wonder twits. Now that I possess this magical staff of Nega-mega-tude, and with my villainous cohorts by my side, nothing can stop me! ( scoffs ) Magic. I know, what an idiot. ( straining ) ( growls ) ( siren wailing ) Well, that was too easy, too. I know! With my genius and your technology, defeating our regular enemies is child's play. It could get a little boring. Hey, what if we made our own villain? You mean, invent a villain so dangerous and powerful that he's even challenging to us? I suppose it's possible. Yeah. What could possibly go wrong? BOTH: To the lab! Up, up, up. This is a perfect chance to try out my porta-portal. Come on, let's blow this place. What? 24th century Timmy is blowing me off? That means I'm even less popular now than I was back then. I'm not gonna sit here and lose my best friend to some fudge-headed whippy dip! Come on! SHEEN: Jimmy! Open up! All I'm saying is, if you guys think you're gonna drag me along everywhere just because Neutron isn't hanging out with you, you've got another think coming. Hey, guys. Excuse us. Step aside. Coming through. Jimmy, Timmy, wait. So I'm thinking he should be humanoid. Sure. Can he have a tail? We can talk about it. Jimmy, it's us, your best friends, Carl and Sheen. He's making something with a tail and didn't even ask us to help. I guess he's gotten tired of us. May I go now? No! No! Huh? I'm bulgy now? Is there no end to the surprises of the 24th century? Hey, I know you guys. You're Timmy's friends. Not anymore. He's blowing us off for your friend Jimmy. And Jimmy blew us off for your friend Timmy. I hate the new Jimmy-Timmy friendship! We have to do something to break them up. But what? What?! CINDY: Oh, hey, guys. I'm back early from vacation. Did I miss anything? Do you know what this means? Do you? Do you? Seriously, you've got to stop doing that. Cindy, you're back! Why are you back? Oh. My mom had an allergic reaction to her seaweed wrap. She'll be fine once the grotesque swelling subsides. What are these two guys doing here? Greetings from the 21st century. We followed Timmy into your universe. Your friend Jimmy must have zapped him with some sort of forget- who-your-friends-are ray, because he's acting like we don't exist anymore. Timmy's in town? Yeah. And now that he and Jimmy are best buds, it's like we don't exist either! And without Jimmy to keep them company, Needy and Needier have been sticking to me like stink on a skunk. So now that you're back, you can get Neutron and Turner fighting again so that everything can go back to normal! Oh, you can bet they won't ignore me. I'm like catnip to those boys. ( gasps ): They poop on you in a box?! That's kitty litter, you idiot! Carl, give me your bag of Jimmy's hair. What? I don't have any... That's not mine. That's not me. Don't worry. I'll have those guys clawing each other's eyes out for my attention in no time. JIMMY: To make our ultimate bad guy, I started with the basics. I downloaded the classic physio-structure of evil from the top ten bestselling videogames, added your tail. Now all we have to do is choose his powers and weaponry. I think he should have a mustache. Mustaches are evil. Not everybody who has a mustache is evil. Your mother has a mustache. You should give him a mustache. JIMMY: Let's give him ultra-laser arm cannons, sonic disrupters, hard-line manipulators. What else? The ability to fire pizza toppings from a tiny slot in his chest! Oh, and he should have real emotions, actual wants and desires, then feelings. ( all aahing ) Feelings, yeah. And a remote-operated destructo chip. So you can dispose of him when you're bored like you've been doing with all your other friends? That's not true. What are you talking about? Talk to the bulgy hand. Anyone who loses your interest gets tossed aside like yesterday's gold bullion. Why don't you make him adoptable, so someone can give him a nice home when you're done playing with him? Oh, fine. TIMMY: There, he's adoptable. Are you both happy? I'll never be happy until spreadable ham is available in a tube! JIMMY: It is. Then I'm happy! I have to say, Turner, I had my doubts about our friendship, but this is pretty great. Yeah. I wonder why we never thought of this before. Hi, boys. Hey, Cindy. Hey, Debbie. What you working on when you should be working on who's gonna be taking me to the Candy Bar? So anyway, how do you feel about solar-powered knees? Sweet! Oh, can his tail have a power? Um, hello, it's me, Cindy, the girl you waged an inter-dimensional war over. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you! I will not be ignored! I'm not budging. Whoa! Want to finish the rest of this someplace where we won't be interrupted, like back in my dimension? Works for me. Hey, Wanda, stand over there, and I'll take your picture. Whoa...! Couldn't break them up, huh? It's like I didn't even exist. ( Wanda screaming ) COSMO: Now I'm really happy! This shouldn't take long. We've already designed the villain. All we have to do is bring him to life. That's where you two come in. Um, are you sure this isn't gonna hurt? Hit it! ( screaming ) You said it wouldn't hurt! No, I didn't. I specifically ignored the question, because I didn't think you'd like the answer. My sole purpose: to hunt you down and to defeat you! Finally, a villain worthy of our talents! Get ready, Timmy. Yes, get ready indeed. ( honks ) Ha! Got your nose. ( maniacal laughter ) What the heck? Hey! You give Timmy back his nose! Where's he going? We'd better follow him. Let me in, Neutron! Let me in! Hey, look, they're not in there, they're in here. Wait! Come back here! Yeah! Come back and fight us! The ditched us and went to Dimmsdale. What?! Well, they can't do that! Out of my way! Don't leave me here with these two. I'm coming with! Wait! Come back! We should go, too. I feel like we just got here. Time moves differently in the 24th century. Got your nose? Got your nose?! What kind of villain plays "Got your nose"?! How horrible! How villainous! How do you speak so well without a nose? We must have been so busy giving him weapons and powers that we forgot to make him really evil. Aha! Cool! A trap! And now, for my next villainous act... ( maniacal laughter ) Hey! What did you do? I have made your shoes moderately filthy! ( maniacal laughter ) Hey, can we talk to you for a sec? ( maniacal laughter ) Sure. What's up? Okay, you're a villain! Right. Well, by definition, that means you have to do villainous things. Sure, sure, got it. You have to actually fight us. You have to be a threat. You sure? Positive. Positive. Okeydoke! ( crash ) ( boys scream ) Hey, Timmy got his nose back! ( singsong ): Timmy! Where are you? ( singsong ): Oh, Jimmy! ( singsong ): Future boys, I bring you fascinating tales of the distant past. Oh, forget it. They're obviously avoiding us. I don't get it, Cindy. What's the big deal? Don't you understand, Libby? I've been doubly rejected. So? There'll be other boys. Oh, please. When am I ever gonna have a science genius and a sweet but clueless yutz fighting over me again? This must be a quadri-spherical atomic transducing booster rocket. Dude, that's a soup can. I'm a sweet but clueless yutz, and even I know that. Perhaps I spoke too soon. ( glass breaking ) Hi, boys. Soup can? Hi, Libby. Hi, Libby. Oh, Cindy's coming back, you guys. Cindy! Tell them you're coming back! I'm not friendless and needy! ( screams ) ( grunting ) Man, this is great! Come on, come on, smack me again! No! We hit you, then you're supposed to hit back! Now, let's try it again. Might I suggest the three wood? ( giggling ) You're tickling me on the inside! Do you really think this is a good idea? We gave him feelings, remember? Exactly. That's the point. We're trying to get him angry so he'll be a better villain. Fore! Yay! Whee! Apparently, we're going to have to try harder. ( laughing ) ( thudding and crashing ) ( shouting angrily ) Will the Right Honorable... ( crashing ) I say! Tallyho! ( giggling ) Hi, Timmy! ( thudding and groaning ) ( camera shutters clicking ) Again! Again! Oh, this is hopeless. Want to go back to the tree house and start from scratch? Totally. Works for me. Hey! Hey, where you guys going? Uh, back to Dimmsdale. Can I come? We're still playing, right? Uh, yeah. We're just taking a break. In fact, why don't you meet us at the Dimmsdale Mall in, say, an hour? Yeah. We'll continue our never-ending battle of good versus evil then. Awesome! ( maniacal laughter ) See you at the mall! You guys are the best. ( sighs ) ( laughing ) You boys are both so funny. I don't know which one I like the most. Oopsie. She's mine! Back off! Back off! The future girl's mine! Wow, that didn't take long. Can we establish a three-feet rule here? ( gasps ) Are you the future of mall security? I'm the villain. ( menacingly ): Sworn enemy of Timmy and Jimmy! ( gleefully ): They're meeting me here in an hour. Ha! Fat chance. It's only a matter of time before Neutron and Turner toss you aside like they did us. Now, which one of you boys wants to buy me a chocolate shake? I do! I do! But I can't afford it. ( arguing ) You're wrong, you know. I'm not just Jimmy and Timmy's archenemy, I'm their arch-friend. You'll see, they'll be here. I know they're coming! ( birds chirping ) ( crickets chirping ) They'll be here! Any minute now. ( thunder cracking ) Any minute. Heart heavy. Feelings hurt. Must adapt. Replace sadness with rage! ( computer beeping ) Wow! I can't believe the sun came up, went down, came back up, and that we had rain and snow and night again, all in one hour! So do we give this new villain any feelings? Yeah, but none of the froufrou ones. Just rage, fury and vengeance. You ditched me, and for that you will pay the ultimate price! ( screaming ) Awesome! Awesome! ( screaming ) ( screaming ) BOTH: Not awesome! ( screaming ) You ditched me, treated me like dirt, then blew me off. Now, face the fury of-- What's my name? Huh. You know, we never really got around to that. Yeah, it didn't seem important at the time. Your words, they sting. But not as much as these will. ( screaming ) Run, you idiots! Idiots? Plural? As in not just me? All right! We should form a club. We could have jackets made, and... ( screaming ) I think he's finally mad at us! High-five! So, what kind of fancy, scientific attack vehicle would you like to battle with? I was thinking something kind of like this. Cosmo? Wanda? Make it so. ( grunts ) Oh, you have time to design a cool assault vehicle, but you can't give me a name? "Adapting"? Bracelets? I don't remember giving him girly weapon-deflecting jewelry. That's because he's adapting. You must have typed "adaptable" instead of "adoptable." Well, you should have checked my spelling! La-la-la, la-la-la-la... Give me a name-- so you can scream it in terror! Yeah, okay, uh... Your name is... "Shirley." "Shirley." I like it. It's manly and threatening. Face the wrath of Shirley! ( laughing ) That is the dumbest name ever! ( laughing ) What? You gave me the dumbest name ever? You tricked me! ( grunting ) Thanks... a lot... Turner! Shirley's not that stupid a name. We could have said "Heidi." I wish Neutron was next to me. What the...? Hey! Wow, he's really angry. Yeah, he could really hurt us. Except for the fact that I'm going to wish us some indestructible super suits. Super suits with a force field. Sweet! What if he adapts something that can beat a super suit? I'm not worried. Why? Because we're "The Idiots." ( growling ) ( screaming ) Would you like my cherry, Cindy? No, take mine. Or whatever this really is in the 24th century. See? We don't need Jimmy and Timmy to have fun! Yeah, we can have a nice relaxing lunch all by ourselves. ( crashing ) What's the big idea? Can't you see we're eating? So? We're fighting a bad guy. Yeah! I think this is a little more important. ( screams ) Was he this big a jerk in our universe? MAYOR: And in my fifth term as your mayor, I will place public safety as my number one... ( object falling ) ( people screaming ) ( crashing ) Ah! ( beeping ) ( screaming ) Wait! What? This is all a big misunderstanding! And to show you how sorry we feel, we made dinner reservations at 8:00 for just the three of us. Really? Just the three of us? What's the name of the restaurant? Uh... Uncle... P.J. O'Pooter Doodle's? "Uncle Pete's Pajama Pavilion." "Uncle Pickle's Sandwich Barn." There is no "Uncle P.J. O'Pooter Doodle's"! You tricked me again! I wish... You're done wishing! ( screaming ) ( explosion ) ( groaning and thudding ) ( screaming ) ( crashing ) ( buzzing ) Well, he is getting better. This is a little more challenging than I had in mind. Yeah, good thing we're wearing our super suits. ( growling ) ( car alarm chirps twice ) Ah! Ah! TIMMY: Uh-oh. Destructo chip? Destructo chip. ( beeping ) ( buzzing ) I don't think so! ( screaming ) ( explosion ) ( maniacal laughter ) ( electrical zapping ) ( screaming ) ( laughing ) You kids think you're so special. Well, how'd you like it if I took away what made you special? Like your genius? And how do you propose to do that? ( buzzing ) Einstein's Theory of Relativity states that energy equals mass times the square of the speed of light. The "P" in "pneumonia" is silent. And all-day suckers only last about 22.3 hours. I am a genius! Thoughts getting cloudy. Logic ebbing away. Sudden urge to make clamshell art. ( screaming; crashing ) Ha! Nice try, villain, but now I'm surrounded by lethal electronic components which I can use to make... ( gasps ) Monster truck rally! Oh, no! My genius, it must be gone. But who cares? The big truck is gonna eat the little trucks! Oh, no, the villain sucked Jimmy genius into his databanks. Now he's a villain and a genius! Just like Dr. Phil. Yes. And once I take your wands, Timmy will be just an average kid who no one understands. Somebody should write a song about that. I wish... That you had been kinder to me? That you hadn't ditched me? That I wasn't about to eat these wands and absorb their power? Well, mostly the last thing. ( munching ) Hey, Timmy, the Truckosaur is fighting Treadinator! It's gonna be monster mayhem. ( chewing loudly ) Aah... Did he just eat those wands? ( burps ) Sure did. Fairy power absorbed! Wow, that didn't sound nearly as dramatic as I thought it would. You are magic no more. ( both scream ) Ha! ( screams ) We're humans! Really? Does this hurt? Ow! That would hurt even if we were still fairies! I know. Now I, the villain whose name isn't Shirley, am the ultimate combination of science and magic. Nothing can stop me! Wait! Wait! Look, I know we were jerks to you. Yeah, we feel real bad. So why don't we all take a nice steam and talk out our problems? Is this another trick? Come on. Do you really think we'd be stupid enough to try to trick you again? Maybe Turner would be. Hey! But I'm a genius. Well, okay. See? Isn't this nice? Yes. The steam really cleans out my evil pores. ( door opens and closes ) Hey, what was that? ( breathes deeply ) I will destroy you! ( teeth chattering ) Not you. You enjoy yourself. Now, where could they be? Excuse me, are you the villain whose name isn't Shirley? Yes. Letter for you. "If you still want to chase us, we'll be in Retroville." Well, that was thoughtful. I will destroy them there! ( birds chirping ) Isn't this great, Libby? We're having a perfectly nice time without Turner or Neutron. I'm just glad Carl and Sheen are getting along with Timmy's friends, so they can get their faces out of my face. You guys are cool. A.J., you're like Jimmy without the goofy hair. Yeah, and Chester here knows everything there is about roadkill. Now, remember, the meat is more sweet when it's flattened on the street. As for me, I love that even though you're both from the future, I'm much smarter than both of you. Guys, guys, we need your help. The villain we invented stole Jimmy's genius. And de-powered... name? Timmy! And de-powered Timmy. Beat it, you guys. Yeah, take a hike, chumps. No, we're serious. There's a crazed inter-dimensional villain on the rampage, and we need your help! CARL: Uh-huh, yeah, whatever. CINDY: Not our problem. CARL: See you. SHEEN: Yeah, right, dude. That could have gone better. Well, I'm not surprised. You weren't very nice to them, you know? BOTH: We weren't? What did I tell you? Idiots! VILLAIN: Pardon me, have you seen... Out of my way, freak boy. Ma'am, if I could just ask you... A moment of your time... Where are the ones called Jimmy and Timmy?! Never heard of them. No, we don't have a son named Jimmy, if that's what you're thinking. Very well. If you won't bring them forth, I'll make them come to me! Hey, look, honey, I've lost weight... and depth. VILLAIN: Ah, this is better. Welcome to your new home. I call it Retrodimmsdaleville! This is just like the place where I was born. But here, I make the rules! ( people screaming ) VILLAIN: Where you guys going? Nowhere. We weren't trying to ditch you, if that's what you were thinking. Yes, we were. You specifically said, "Let's ditch the villain." You humans are all alike-- think you can bend a person's feelings, crumple them up when you're done with them. Well, how do you like being bent? ( screams ) How do you like being crumpled up? This not super fantastic. Well, get used to it. You humans are gonna be my playthings for a change. Now, let's see. What else of Jimmy and Timmy's will I take to play with? I'll take this tree. Oh. A school! ( people screaming ) It's coming along nicely, but it still needs a little something. Where's our house? Termites? College pranksters? Inter-dimensional super-villain? Please. How many times do we have to say we're sorry? How many times have they said it so far? 512. That's a start. ( screaming ) ( maniacal laughter ) All right! Yeah! ( beeping ) ( sniffing ) What's going on? Let's see. A swing set! I'll need one of those. Hey! There you are! ( kids screaming ) Everybody, run away! ( screaming ) No! I'm tired of running! Me, too. Do what you want to us, villain, but leave our friends alone! Oh, I'm not gonna hurt them. They were the only ones who were nice to me. But you guys are coming with me! ( maniacal laughter ) Say, you guys are kind of cute when you're this small. ( laughs ) What are you gonna do with them? Give them a front row seat to the destruction of both their universes! You guys have about two days to live. Enjoy yourselves. Have a blast! Oh, and here's a portal, in case you want to save yourselves and hang with me. ( boys screaming ) ( maniacal laughter ) Oh, no. He's going to destroy everything! I want to go home! I want to go back to the 21st century... where I'll still have 300 years to live. I want to go see the monster trucks! The big trucks is gonna eat the little trucks. Sorry, dude. That's three days from now. The universe will be gone by then. No...! ( Sheen screaming ) Whoops, almost forgot. ( maniacal laughter ) What's happening? What do we do? Let's look at the angry clouds and see what we see! Ooh, there's an angry pony. And, ooh, there's a bunch of rabid bunnies. Those aren't clouds. That bad guy stole all our friends and buildings, and now our universe is starting to fall apart. But I'm sure your future technology has something that can deal with this. Hey, short, shiny and delusional, you're not in the future. You never left the 21st century, got it? You mean, this is actually happening? ( screaming ) Hey! Hands off! Guys, relax! He left us this portal to his world. Let's just ask him nicely to stop this. I'm sure he'll say yes. No! CINDY: What do you mean no? I mean no. I don't care if your universes are falling apart. It's you guys I care about. ( kids scream ) As long as you never betray me! Any-who, I'm off to terrorize your loved ones. Bye! ( people chattering frantically ) I kind of like it. Look at me! I'm as limber as a schoolgirl. Did you know you have a mole on your ankle? Do I know you? Why don't you have a mole on your ankle? I demand to speak to the person in charge! You rang? Ah, yes. We are all sort of hoping we could go home now. Well, I have good news and bad news. The bad news: your worlds are falling apart even as we speak. But the good news is, you're all condemned to live out your lives as my playthings! ( both screaming ) What exactly does that entail? ( screams ) The pain! Hold on, I missed the heel. ( screaming ) I can't believe this. He stuck us to his refrigerator like magnets and then left?! We don't have much time! He could be back any... Oh, what's the word? Longer than a second, shorter than an hour. Minute? Yeah, minute. So, got any ideas?! Ah, just two. Monkeys make me laugh, and there's a bunch of stuff in my lab that could probably get us out of here. Or... we could raid your lab for some stuff that can get us out of here. Why didn't I think of that? 'Cause I'm smarter than you. I suppose I could live here. I like my new trim figure. We're not living here. We just have to get the villain to listen to reason. CROCKER: Why won't you listen to reason?! It's my universe-- I don't have to! Crazy teacher, crazy teacher. Dad, dad. Mom, mom. I win again! Uh, on second thought, we might want to start coming up with a plan. Oh, I'm bored. Time to play Cards Screaming in Terror. ( all screaming ) Look out, it's raining authority figures I don't respect. ( all screaming ) What else can I do to you people? Ooh! I know. You can throw supermodels at us. No, no, I was thinking... this! Hey, why can't I move? I don't know. ( both grunting ) Well, that was anticlimactic. Of course, I rule. It's horrible. I know! He spelled "rules" with a "Z." What's up with that? Hey! Cool! It's Timmy and that kid that I'm way smarter than. Everybody hide. If they know we're here, they'll just shove us aside like we're nothing, and then go save the universes themselves. Yeah, you stupid universe-saving jerks! Here they come, just watch. Any minute now, they'll say something totally insulting and hurtful. Ah! I knew it! Aw, man, because of us, he's probably hurting our friends and families right now. I know. No matter what happens to us, we've got to fix this. CINDY: Wow, they really do care. We should have accepted their apology when they hit 500. ( dads yelling ) TIMMY: Okay, he's distracted. Let's hit him with everything we've got. Right. So, um, what do we got? I don't know; it's your lab! Yeah, but I'm recently, uh, what's the word when you don't know stuff? Moronified. ( villain clears throat ) Eat this, villain! Neat bubbles. Cosmo, you idiot! I'm sorry, force of habit. Jimmy, you idiot! Run! ( screaming ) ( both screaming ) ( screaming and grunting ) You're not getting away that easily! There's no place you can hide from me here. And when I find you, your fates are sealed. Oh, man, we're doomed! Hey, there, tall, mean, and crazy. Hi, monster man. Hi, guys, can't talk. Looking to destroy Jimmy and Timmy. Call me! Thanks for the save, but what are you guys doing here? We heard you saying how sorry you were, and we decided to let you help us save our universes. Well, it won't be easy. Every time you throw something at him, he adapts. I've got an idea. Carl, turn around. Why? ( screams ) Okay, look. We know he's big, we know he has superpowers, and we know he has weapons. And look, here's the sun, and he's smiling. What we have to do is trick the villain into adapting away those three things. Agreed, Jimmy? You're all pretty and stuff. Close enough. ( giggles ): He called me pretty. ( phone rings ) Hello. Sheen! What's that? Sure, I could take a little break from trying to get Jimmy and Timmy. Ow! ( A.J. laughing ) ( laughing ) Check out my big air. Ow! ( laughing ) Big air! ( bell dings ) You're too huge. We're kicking your flat, bendy butt. ( alarm blaring ) Huh? I'm adapting! Prepare to get served! ( glass shattering ) ( phone ringing ) Excuse me a sec, guys. Hello. Cindy! What's up, girl? Brunch? I'm so there. Hi, Villain. Come on in-- I can't wait to talk about how much I hate Jimmy and Timmy with you. ( alarm beeping ) Oh, I'm going to have to ask you to remove that arm cannon. ( alarm blaring ) And that rocket launcher. ( alarm blaring ) Any other metal? Right, right, sorry. CARL: Help! Oh, help! Jimmy and Timmy are being mean to me. Brunch will have to wait. Carl, show me where they are, so I may smite them! ( horn blowing "Dixie" ) Whah-hoo! I'm a Truckosaurus rex! ( horn continues blowing ) You were supposed to wait for Chester. Wait a minute. You lied to me? Chester, help! Uh, having some problems here. Chester, hurry up! You all lied to me? I warned you! ( both screaming ) ( all screaming ) Neat. I mean, exactly as I planned it. ( maniacal laughter ) Why can't I get out? TIMMY: Cosmo and Wanda's powers don't work under a butterfly net, bucket head, which means you're trapped. JIMMY: Whah-hoo! if I can't escape because of magic, then I must adapt the magic away. ( grunts ) We have our wands back. Yay! Ew! Mine's all phlegmy. ( horn blowing "Dixie" ) You think this is over? I'm still superstrong. I wish he wasn't. ( grunts ) Oh, my back! There he is-- get him! ( all shouting ) He's powerless and trapped. Let's kick him while he's down. Wait! Stop! Don't you... what's the word? Understand. Understand? None of this was really the villain's fault. We programmed him, me and Tommy. Timmy. Becky. We made him this way. It's us you should be mad at, and... and... What was I saying? What we're really trying to say is, we're sorry. Wow. Now I know I have a silicone-based heart circuit, because it's breaking. Uh, hello. Worlds... disintegrating. Oh. right. I wish everybody and everything was where it was supposed to be. VILLAIN: Wait! What about me? I think I can figure out something for you, as soon as somebody gives me my brains back! VILLAIN: Prepare to taste this deliciously-evil pizza with pepperoni. Now... get out! ( Sheen, Chester scream ) I love those crazy kids. Thanks, guys. We couldn't have done it without you. He said it; he totally said it, and I got it on tape. Aren't we forgetting something? Oh, right. I wish Jimmy had his brains back. Can you hold off on that for a second? Say it again. You're smarter than me. Again. You're smarter than me. No, say it again. ( chuckles ) That's the pretty girl. Okay, give him his brain back. Captioning sponsored by MTV TELEVISION NETWORKS Hi. I'm Paul.
