Thank you. What can I help you with? I can not leave without knowing ... - I understand. How did you find it? How did you get it, that it fell? We received a call. - So someone was with him? No. The man said only, that he has suffered and where he is. You did not say your name. Here it is not unusual. People do not like it to speak to the police. Will you investigate? - We were all in the bar. We have published and published in the local newspaper, that we are looking for witnesses. We expect how things will develop. - Expect? Such is the expression. We do it work, ma'am. Trust me. Relax! Have you ever talked to your husband? Almost every day. And you would know if there were problems with alcohol or with narcotics?

We rarely see them. I'll send you his stuff. You did not care much. He did not have the patience to go home. Take care of yourself! - You too. Chao. We met at the hospital. He was my boss ... and a friend. Sorry! Thank you. Are you waiting for Victor? Actually, I do not know what I'm waiting for. I need to go. - Where are you going? I do not know. In the hotel. It's not safe here. If you have nothing against. Of course. Like that. I finished. Are you OK? What was Julie? In the work? Good! He was a good boss. Good man. He wanted to laugh. Is that so? Take this. When you settle down, call me. If you need something or if you do not want to be alone. Were you at the bar with him that night? I'm not going to such places anymore. Hello.

Yes, but where? Ask a taxi driver. "Paulosi, the carving man". He will know. Thank you. Do you want my figure? How much does it cost? - 250. No, I'm sorry. But I will give you something. No. I make figurines for money. I do not ask. My husband bought it from you, right? He lived. Bought many of them? Do you know him? He lived? Yes? - Hi ... Is Noah here? I want to say, he lives here, right? Yes. She's sleeping right now. - All right. Who are you? Excuse me. I'm Carmen, Gil's wife. Do you know him, Gil? - Yes ... Do you want to wake him up? My dad. She is my cousin. Why? Nothing. Thank you. Just by making a cafe. Come in. I tried to call you. - I moved to the hotel. I went to see the carpenter. Paulos. There I saw the car of Noah and the Inuit girl from the hospital. Will you sit down? I thought to throw them out. They were all parted. Was she here? Not for long. He bought statuettes, gave in money for the child, but they were finished. He asked about my father. And after and for you. What are you going to do? - I do not know! I do not know what to do! It's growing up! You are the one, who needs to do something. You're just sitting here all day and you do not do anything! Do not touch it! What is happening? If you do not tell him, I'll do it! Hello. With what to help? I was interesting. Do you want to stay by the hour? Yes ... Why not? Come on, sit down. Thank you. Turn it around. I marked it here. Excuse me. Thank you. - Come again! Are you busy with fashion? - With cosmetics. Marketing. Have a nice day! What do you want? Why are you following me? How old are you? Twenty. Why? Twenty ... You were still a child! I was not a kid. You're right. I do not know. Did he ever tell you about me? Yes. He was talking about you. A lot. I think he loved you very much. Do not leave, do you? Even though I gave birth to a child, and you do not. You can hit me. But you will not hurt me. Now, excuse me. I need to get back to my class. You! I know that you like statuettes. - No! I do not like statuettes. - New price. 80 dollars! I do not like it. Do you want a drink? - With pleasure! Beer. Did you find Paulosi? I found it. Thank you. Noah? Excuse me, did I wake you up? It's Carmen. Gill's wife. I'm good. Now I'm at the bar and I thought, maybe ... Would you like to come? I need to talk to you. Yes? Thank you! Goodbye. Thank you for coming! What do you want for drinking? - One car. One car! So you do not drink? I drank enough. But I stopped. - Good for you. He said that Gil was your friend. Yes. Almost as a family member. From the family? Is not it? What do you mean? I do not understand you. Well yes! Why did I want to come? That girl. Ani. She is your niece? Yes! Granddaughter of my late wife. He has been living with us for many years. Why? Is not your family? The tram and often beat her. She fled from him. Now I should certainly pity her! I do not know. I am not the one who says that. I knew there might be adventures. But this! Kid! And he did not tell me a word! I like to hit it, strong! To hurt him! I'm sure he did not want to to hurt you. Hey, pretty! Now let's not start to preach to me? I hate him! I hate him! I do not feel good at all. She was with me. What am I doing here? Hello! How are you today? Do not ask. My head will crack. Do you want tea? Why am I here? What is this place? I come here when I want to peace and tranquility. Okay, but I can not stay here. I want to come back! We'll be back later. No! I want to come back now! - Of course. It's still there. So you want tea. No. I want a cigarette and I need to piss. Just choose your place. I go up the river. There are many trout there. I'm coming with you. Do you want a fish? More than that, say health! So you're a real ink. Good in fishing. Good hunter. No, I do not know much. My father was a super hunter. She did not manage to teach me. - Why? They took me when I was eight years old. They sent me to a boarding school, in the priests. And the end. But my son Danny, he's a good hunter! Learn from my dad. I do not know if it's morning or night. I'm totally lost! Go to sleep. We'll be back after that. He lived ... He liked the place very much. He wanted to fish. Here you are doing well. I thought you would rejoice to see it. I imagine how happy he was here! Daddy! Who is this? Why is it here? - It's not your job. What is happening? - Danny just ran away with Ani. What do you mean? A policeman came to your house, inquired about Gil. As soon as he left, Danny was spinning. He took the rifle and grabbed Annie. She he cried, but he forced her to go. Ask Joshua can I take my boat for myself? Do not tell anyone. We will meet at the seafront. Why is all this, Noah? - My son, Danny. If there is anything general with Gil, we should go to the police! He has a rifle. He spat out. No police. If I go, I can chat with him. Then I come with you. - No. It's not a good idea. And tell the police what is happening? I can leave you here! - But I know you will not do it. Take this. What do you want? - Noah! He's drunk! Do not panic, son. I just want to talk. Why is she here? He wants to know about Gil. No one knows that we are here. Swing! I have nothing to tell her. You can not stay here. They will find you. No! We can go to the continent. I can live there. I'm not like you! Stay there! What did you do to him? - It was an accident! Really! No one will believe me! As soon as it was an accident, why did you leave him there? You have no heart! - I did not want to get hurt! He's dead! - I did not want to! I was scared ... I was scared, the devil to take it! And now you want to pass? - Shut up! Enough. I do not want to stay here. - Do not say that, Ani! We will go to the continent, we'll handle it! You and me. I love you. Stop, please! Do not even try! He will not come back. You will not survive over the winter on the continent. Nobody can, no longer! I'd rather die on the continent, like an ink. I will not rot in their prison! It will not happen! Return with them as soon as you like it! Return with the boat. I'd rather wait. I'll rest a bit. I'll get into the cottage next to his. You enter the other. Simigak. Does it mean anything? No. I baptized him with my grandfather. He was a good man. Now my son cares for me. Do you want to know what happened to Gil? I was there ... That night we wanted Have fun and have a drink ... Let's have another drink? I am without a broken pair! - And I do not have kits. Ask him. - But yes! Why not? Leave it alone! - Come on! Actually just wanted to brake. He lived! Hey, Gil! Do you already work? Yes. Have you been left with money? Something did not reach us. Amy yes! That's right. Come on, guys! This evening you have enough. No no! Come on, Julie! Live, be nice to me! I need money! Why not? You give her money on her! Why not me? - Enough, Danny, you're drunk! You come here with a lot of money, you sleep with our girls. What will you say? Shut up! - Danny, stop it! What is it for you? Your fucking whore? I told you to shut up! Asshole! We ran into the hotel and we called in the police. We did not stay with him. Son! Son! Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! Son! I can not do it. I just can not ... Sorry. It will not return it. But I believe you. You knew all the time. He is with me Will you tell him about his father? Of course. Everyone will tell him.
