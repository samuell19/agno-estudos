Let it be law OUT OF THE 320 MILLION WOMEN LIVING IN LATIN AMERICA ONLY 8 PERCENT CAN FREELY TERMINATE THEIR PREGNANCY IN ARGENTINA ONE WOMAN DIES EACH WEEK DUE TO A CLANDESTINE ABORTION AFTER MANY MONTHS OF UNPRECEDENTED MOBILIZATION ON JUNE 13, 2018 WHEN A MILLION PEOPLE TOOK TO THE STREETS CONGRESS FINALLY ACCEPTED A BILL TO LEGALIZE AND MAKE ABORTION LEGAL, SAFE AND FREE. LET IT BE LAW! After debating for 23hrs deputees are ready to vote Today is a great day for all women. We are proud to take this step after a century. Thousands of women spent the night at the square waiting for this bill to be passed. Those who vote for "no" should know that the only choice they are offering women is to go to jail. Male and female Representatives, this is the century of women's rights. Sooner or later, the girls wearing green handkerchiefs will get the rights they are fighting for. You have the power to vote for our rights. Don't be afraid to do it. Put an end to clandestine abortions and vote for the health and freedom of women. To "sororas," the collective sorority women who is now part of Argentine politics, we are different but united, and always in favor of women, To all women in their houses, our mothers and daughters, we want abortion to be legal, safe and free. Let it be law! On the morning of June 14, the House of Representatives passed the bill. But only with the Senate vote it would become a law. We have been fighting for many years. Today there is an extraordinary echo throughout the youngest generations. Every teenage girl today knows that she is strong, a living testimony of the fight of many women, to be able to decide freely about their own body. The system that oppresses us Will fall, will fall, will fall We will end patriarchy and the capitalist system too. We are united and organized Let's march, let's march, let's march on! We are the granddaughters of those witches that you couldn't burn Mr. President, we all are united Let's fight, let's fight, let's fight! This is my body and I decide: Let abortion be legal! MILITANCY A few days before the Senate vote, Liliana Herrera died due to a clandestine abortion. What we understood, is that the mother had an older daughter who also died because of a clandestine abortion. This woman is now in charge of 5 kids. They are in a situation of absolute vulnerability. This is the poorest sector, The "forgotten" ones in this country. We will say goodbye to our fellow, Liliana, with respect and emotion. We'll promise we will accompany her and never give up. We'll do whatever is necessary for the bill to become a law. Let's believe in ourselves and demand legal abortion. Legal abortion now! Legal abortion now! Our militancy in support of feminism, in search of social justice, is related to the granting of rights. We need it to become a law to give women the possibility to have a right to health. We should never allow, neither in Argentina nor in other parts of the world, that a woman dies, as a victim of the absence of the State. The State is responsible for the lack of health rights for women. When they decide to terminate their pregnancy, they don't have a safe way of doing it. San Martin province of Buenos Aires I've been working at the maternity unit for 28 years, and I was trained with a punitive concept of abortion. Women who came here, to our unit... we were told we had to report them and treat them as if they were criminals. Fortunately, after years of work and sacrifice by women and also by us, the serious consequences of clandestine abortion are starting to disappear. Women who lost their womb and who lost their lives. -Ready? -Yes. Ready! Latin America will be totally feminist! Down with chauvinism! Latin America will be totally feminist! First, I'd like to salute this day of struggle, which we organized from the student movement, and we continue making history. This social debate reaching every corner of the country took us, women, youth, a generation that demands all its rights into a debate against the most obscurantist sectors of our society. We have been winning: a social majority does not want women to die due to clandestine abortions. And they want us to be able to have a choice regarding our body, our lives, our fates. A situation in 2017 left an indelible mark on me... Here, a young woman died due to an abortion. She was found in a rented room. She had bled to death. She had tried to end her pregnancy with a knitting needle and she was five-month pregnant. That case moved me, and it also made me think that here we need a social network, in every place, so that no woman feels alone, so that one, or many women may accompany her. My green handkerchief is always on me, so they know they can approach me and ask me anything, for information, where to go, who to call if they need an abortion. Hypocrisy hurts me. The outrageous hypocrisy in small towns and in the church, the Christian religion, and Evangelists, there are many of them. They can be so powerful, and they directly or indirectly kill women who are so desperate as to believe that they can use a knitting needle to end a pregnancy. My mother showed everyone she was absolutely against abortion, but she had taken her own daughter to have an abortion even though my sister didn't want to. My sister, when she was older, had two other abortions. She almost died once. I'm gonna cry... It's hard. I remember she called me... from a slum in Podestá. They gave her two pills, the abortion was half-done, and she suffered an infection. She was afraid of the situation, so she went to a clandestine hospital at José León Suárez. She called me 5 hours later, I was working, She called me once it was over. And she told me, "I'm alone, I don't feel well, I'm dizzy, they got me out as if I were an animal. I still can't feel my legs." A horrible situation. And one month ago, or maybe less, we accompanied a girl who told us that she had decided to end her pregnancy, and she said she was dizzy, that she was bleeding from time to time. We asked about the smell and color of the blood. She said the blood smelled bad, that she had fainted on the metro. They took her to the hospital, she had parsley inside her... She needed a hysterectomy, she lost her uterus. She had tried something that seemed forgotten, but it wasn't. In the capital of the country, today, and even being accompanied by feminists, the girl had parsley inside her. Parsley inside her womb. And I think that in 2018 things like that cannot happen. No. PRO-LIFE EVANGELIST MEETING Children will not be killed in their mothers' wombs. We ask for forgiveness for killing children in their mothers' wombs, for not valuing them, for neglecting them, for abandoning those children who are now with God. As a woman, I ask for forgiveness for performing abortions, for all the abortions carried out by Argentine women and for rejecting the children God gave us. And I, as a preacher, ask for forgiveness for keeping silent regarding this for a long time. I ask you, Lord, to touch the heart of men and make them accept their responsibility and raise their children, recognize them, love them, and make them safe. We pray for you to remove the orphan spirit from Argentina and from the whole continent, and to raise a generation of responsible parents. Father of orphans and defender of widows, you, my Lord, in your holy dwelling give refuge to the abandoned ones. We ask you to give refuge for the babies who don't have one. Connect them with families that can take care of them, Lord. Let them be loved, let them be fed, let them have a home and let them have faith. We declare that this generation that will be born will take the Gospels to the corners of the Earth. We bless the generation that will be born. Repeat with me. We bless the generation that will be born. Amen. Amen. Congress Square ...with your precious blood so that, with His crucified love, we can love with all our heart. Let us honor with dignity the price of our salvation, Amen. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Thank you very much. BELIEFS Like it or not... There's a strong element based on beliefs in the decision we are taking tonight. I don't think it's wrong. But beliefs have a lot to do with the vote of the Senators. I respect beliefs. But I think beliefs are something for yourself. They represent my right to privacy. I am a man of faith, I am a Catholic man, and I certainly have faith. I embrace faith in my life. But you know what? I have faith, and I embrace faith in my life, but there's a difference between belief and the role of the State. Because I am part of a party with a secular vision, and within that secular vision, the opinion of a majority or the belief of a majority cannot be imposed on the entire society. Bernal Oeste province of Buenos Aires 43% of poverty 18% of child pregnancies I believe the reality of people, the reality of life is also the reality of death for many people, and abortion is also a reality. It's an undeniable reality. It's a painful reality that nobody can be glad about. But it's a reality: people have ended their pregnancies, some people will end them. They never ask us, priests, for permission. They never ask for our opinion. Obviously, nobody is happy to end a pregnancy. Nobody says, "Great! I had an abortion!" Or "Tonight I'll have fun and tomorrow I'll have an abortion." Nobody does that. That's false. That's why it's disturbing for some fundamentalist sectors that do not want comprehensive sex education, condoms or abortion. They want "bunny" families without any contact with reality or, as some people say, "The only solution is abstinence." Really? The abstinence of pedophile priests? Whose abstinence? Because theoretically pedophile priests are abstinent. They say we are leftist murderers And they are genocidal fascists They say they want to save two lives And they protect pedophile priests Abortion today Or what? Or we'll kick up a real fuss! Abortion today Or we'll kick up a real fuss! I'm crying because I think about... about María Acevedo. A girl with cancer and they didn't end her pregnancy. She left many children because of religious beliefs. That type of abortion is already part of the law. How can we explain her children today that their mother is dead because some doctors who believe in religions didn't treat her? Honestly, reality hurts. It hurts. That's why I'm crying. Because we've been fighting for many years, we, feminists. We've been fighting for this for years. And today we're so close. Close to abortion becoming law. Ana María had cancer. To preserve the fetus, the doctors didn't treat her. I took her because she had a fever, and she had some tests done, and they found out she was 2 weeks pregnant. We asked them to perform a curettage, to end her pregnancy. And they said they couldn't, there was nothing they could do because they wanted to save both lives. they wanted to hold an ethics committee meeting with other doctors, the priest, the social worker, the judges, everyone, and us, her parents, but that meeting never happened. But in her medical records it says the meeting happened, but they never met with us. The priests objected to the abortion, so the doctors didn't perform the abortion because the priests were against it. Two priests went to see her. Every day they saw my daughter lying in bed. They spent two hours with her. But they never gave her the opportunity to live. And she was a Catholic and everything. We demand justice for Ana because Ana deserved to live and raise her children, to be with us, because she didn't hurt anyone. She didn't deserve to die like that. My daughter was killed. She was never treated. They did a C-section because they didn't want her to die with the baby in her. She couldn't bear it. They used chemotherapy 8 days after the C-section, but they destroyed her. And they didn't treat her when she was in intensive care. They tied her feet and hands but she couldn't move, they tied her, and she died that way, like a criminal, with her feet and hands tied. Florencia suffered domestic violence and decided to end her pregnancy. They put pills in her womb. One morning she woke up in a pool of blood. And in excruciating pain. She couldn't feel her legs. When I got to the emergency room, they didn't let my sister in. They made her wait outside, and I had to go in alone. I was feeling really bad, I was crying in pain because the pain was excruciating. After I went in, the gynecologist who did the ultrasound started mistreating me. "You got pregnant, you got some pills inside of you, it's your fault! Now give me your information. Sit straight, and if you're in pain, tough luck!" I was crying and screaming. When I filled the form, she said, "Not everything is out, you need surgery or you'll have an infection." And they took me to the nurses' room. It was on the maternity ward floor, but the room was isolated. In a corner. A room where the nurses kept supplies. They didn't give me any pain killers. Nothing. I asked, crying to the gynecologist to give me something because I couldn't take the pain any more But she refused. And she left me in that room, and they left. Nobody came to the room during the whole day. The pain was so terrible I would fall asleep and wake up. I was anesthetized by my own pain. And while I was suffering through this the nurses came in and out of the room to get gauze, towels, bed sheets... They were chatting and laughing, they talked about their things, they were drinking "mate" by my bed, and I started crying and asked them when I was going to be operated on because I felt like I was dying. I was bleeding badly. And nobody answered. It was as if I weren't there. Midday came, and then the afternoon, and night, and I was still there. Finally, at midnight, I was operated on We summon Cecilia Ousset, who specializes in Ob-Gyn. I had to do many curettages at a public hospital to finish clandestine abortions with dead fetuses. I saw women die, sometimes mothers of several children, who unfortunately spent their last minutes of life with me and a policewoman asking them who had performed the abortion because it was a crime. Most of them were poor young women, some of them with other kids, and they took the pain, the fever, the rotten smell and the secret of the abortionist to their tomb. I'm a Catholic, and I have four children. I experienced extremely violent situations. Women who arrived at the emergency room who had had a clandestine abortion in poor sanitary conditions. And those women were judged, stigmatized, mistreated from the moment that they entered the hospital because they had committed a crime. I was part of that mistreatment. It's quite difficult for me to talk about this, because it was a process. First I realized I was wrong, it was a mistake. It was a lack of love, of kindness, and I have always been a religious person. "Save both lives or none" I don't see the relationship with my religion. "Save both lives or none" is a crime. It's extremely violent. I can't believe Jesus would want that. It's really the opposite of my religion. If you say you want a better, more equal world, well, rich people have abortions. As well as poor women. Only they don't have the money to do it safely. So let's give both women the chance to have it under the best circumstances because they are equal, like it or not. Maybe not to everyone, but if you are a religious person, to God they are equal. Today, if a woman has an abortion and the fact is discovered, she could end up in jail. I'll quote Eduardo de la Serna, who explains this quite well. In times of Jesus, they find an adulterous woman, meaning: the man is beside her, but she is the only one taken. According to the law, that woman had to be killed, had to be stoned. And they said to Jesus, "If you are God, then obey the law." But Jesus replied, "Those without sin throw the first stone." I am completely sure Jesus would not send anyone to jail for having an abortion. Every 3 hours, a teenager gives birth 70 percent of those pregnancies are not wanted. Buenos Aires Feminist drum players rehearsal I am a theologian. I was a religious person. But the Church has always defended patriarchy. So I stopped believing and I criticize the patriarchal theology. I'm part of the feminist theology that defends the rights of women. Besides, what feminist theologians want is a symbolic change. We think that if God is male, man is God. A change in the patriarchal system will only come when there's a cultural and symbolic change. Women are second class members of the church. So we started to question and to disagree on the teaching of hierarchies which are not the teachings of doctrine. We learned a lot from feminist theology. The sacred was deconstructed because the founding myths of the main monotheist religions are myths created to sustain the patriarchy. I got pregnant. And the only thing I was sure about was that I didn't want to be a mother. I decided to end it, in complete precariousness because I had no information. There was no access to the Internet, no social media, nothing. A friend told me about some pills. The problem was how to get them, but it was just a question of luck. I had a friend who worked at a drugstore, and he got me the pills. First I was really scared. Then I needed money for the pills. And then, I needed to be brave about doing it. You don't wake up one morning and say, "What a beautiful day, I'll have an abortion today." No, you think about it. You have lots of things in your head. I come from a religious family. I've been baptized. I was an altar girl. I had my First Communion, my Confirmation. All the sacraments of the Church. But during this process, I learned to separate two things. The Church as an institution and the Church as faith. I separate them. I believe in God, but not in the Church as an institution, in the priests, the nuns and such. They always say "God is everywhere." If God is everywhere, I don't need a church, or a confession. Because, thank God, I have a clear conscience. We should separate the Church from the State, particularly those who are religious people should learn to separate the institution from the faith. Because they made us believe for a long time that they go together, but they don't. The basis of this, when they describe it as constitutional or unconstitutional, any debate ends at: When does "life" begin? For those against the bill, a one-minute embryo is already a human life and so it has the right to make a woman carry it for nine months and be a mother, and then we'll see... That is That's not acceptable. Nobody has that right, let alone the State. In Argentina exist legally, under specific circumstances the right for a woman to access a legal abortion, according to the Supreme Court of Justice. In a rape, for exemple, of a 10 year old girl, a minor... If she’s pregnant, it was a rape, right? There’s no doubt about it. But what if she wasn’t a victim of rape? She wanted sex at ten? With her grandmother’s partner? -Let’s say, yes. -She did? What about to the girl’s life? She needs all our support, eveything necessary to carry on with her life and the life of her baby. So she should not interrupt her pregnancy? Yes. The Pro-life movement rejects existing abortion laws all over the world. In the USA, It keep growing, for all countries and lawmakers to step back to end abortion laws so that the abortion law is repealed all over the world. To legalize abortion, Madam Speaker, is to admit the failure of the State. I believe in the right to live. Inalienable. I do not give up and look for devious tactics, Mme Speaker. I believe equality means creating the necessary bases for each Argentine to be born, grow up and be whole people. What's happening in Argentina is sad, it hurts. We are in need. Do you know what hurts the most? It hurts to think that they are trying to establish a new form of discrimination. A "wanted/not-wanted" person discrimination, the latter with no rights at all, even their right to live, Madam Speaker. The right to live! "If you approve abortion, I don't vote for you." Are the representatives aware of how many women and pregnant people had an abortion and risked their lives while they are debating the bill? Two nights ago, 22-year-old Liliana Herrera, mother of two, died at the Santiago del Estero Regional Hospital due to an infection after an unsafe abortion, a victim of clandestine abortion. She's the third woman who died this year in that hospital, in that city. Liliana went to the hospital with a serious infection. She was crying in pain and the smell of the infection was unbearable. However, as punishment, she was not treated that night. The next morning she was operated on, but she died. The Herrera family lost both of their daughters to clandestine abortions. Liliana lived in this house with her two daughters. Milagros and Mia, Liliana's daughters Mariano Liliana's father Graciela Liliana's mother That morning, she said her back and her waist hurt. But we couldn't take her to a hospital without a car. There was a guy. He came and took her with his pick-up truck. Two hours later, they said they were taking her to Santiago. I was waiting for her there, in Santiago. When they got there, they didn't let me see my sister. She was taken to the operating room, and they said they were going to perform a curettage. But they didn't do it that day. She spent the whole night there and they performed it at 9 a.m. the next day. We think that if they had operated on her, the result would have been different. This happened because She didn't say anything. She didn't say anything because of the doctors. Since there is no law, she probably was afraid the doctors would call the police. Belen had a severe stomach ache. Her mom took her to the hospital. There, she started bleeding. She had a miscarriage. Belen didn't know she was pregnant. They found a dead fetus in the hospital restroom. She was charged with homicide, but the fetus was never found. Belen was sentenced to 7 years in jail. I never said anything, I never... I never said anything. But I don't want anybody else to suffer what I suffered. It's horrible to arrive at a hospital... with a terrible stomach ache and wake up surrounded by police looking at your private parts with the support of doctors and to end up in jail because of a miscarriage. I was afraid to go to a hospital. I never go to a hospital now, because I'm scared. I don't go even if I'm in pain. But every Senator and every Representative who talked about abortion, those who refused to pass the bill, should know what women go through. Because they don't know. They don't know how much we suffer. They don't know what I went through at that hospital. They don't know what I had to go through. There's something that angers me, that angers me a lot, and that's hypocrisy. The hypocrisy of many people who now carry a light blue handkerchiefs and accompanied a relative or a girlfriend to have an abortion. The hypocrisy of those doctors who now ethically object because they won't be able to charge 30,000 pesos, 40,000 pesos for a clandestine abortion. That's why they are lobbying against this bill. HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS We summon the next speaker. Alika Kinan. A survivor of sexual slavery. I'm a mother of six. Four daughters and two sons. I was rescued in October 2012 from a brothel called "El Sheik" in Tierra del Fuego. Today, I was asked by Senator Durango to speak about the relationship between abortion and human trafficking and sexual slavery. A few days ago, the owner of a clinic spoke about institutional conscientious objection. And I know him because he burnt me with a cigar and he went with his group of medical friends to the brothel where I was, and he actually didn't conscientiously object to what they were doing. We were sexual slaves. But he and his friends were exerting sexual violence, psychological violence, financial violence, physical violence on our bodies. It's the same hypocrisy we've been hearing every day in Congress, from Representatives and Senators. Today I ask that we move away from hypocrisy and think of abortion as a reality. Women die because of clandestine abortions. In a slum, the priest said, "In poor neighborhoods there's no abortion." And a woman asked the priest who was in the slum before, "But the priest knows I had an abortion. He knows you accompanied me to the hospital because I was bleeding and they made it look like peritonitis so that the police would not send me to jail. If he knows, why does he lie?" Those things don't help at all. A sensible debate would be much more useful for society to grow with it, so that the Church would know that society does not abide by everything the Church says. Because we are Christian adults. We can discuss the Holy Trinity, but we should not act like a guardian of everything Bishops say, especially when we are not dealing with religious but with human things. Everyone should know that the dilemma that society imposes on us, that if some people are pro-life and others are not, that dilemma is false. That's not true. I'm in favor of the two lives and every life. But I want everyone to have a good life. So I cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that there are girls getting pregnant and giving birth who can't raise their children in decent conditions. To cry now over the life of the embryo, when afterwards that embryo is 7, 10 or 12 years old and they don't care about them, if they have education, health services, justice... If they are killed in a shooting, if they are victims of police brutality... That's too hypocritical, too painful. I want the life, the two lives, every life, but the whole life. I want every Argentine citizen to have the decent life that every person deserves. I'm Betty, from the Barrios de Pie organization. I'm going to tell you what we go through in the "barrios," the slums of the Buenos Aires, what we feel about abortion. There are many women who have clandestine abortions. And they say that when they go to this clandestine place in the slum, not outside, in the slums there are clandestine places and the Police, the Government, the State don't do anything about it. They know where they are, but they don't do anything. What's happening is terrible. They don't care about the death of women. There are women who go to the hospital too late. When they arrive at the hospital, they are in serious condition. And they can't be saved. 2019: 33,6 % of the argentine population is poor, as well as 48 % of minors. The youngest and the poorest women are the victims of clandestine abortions. Because the youngest ones have no economic autonomy. So they can't solve the problem in silence. And they need a clandestine solution. And the poorest don't have the resources, and they are the 50,000, 70,000 women who go to a public hospital every year because of the consequences of unsafe abortions. Single mother of two. Her eldest son has health problems and requires constant attention. I got pregnant. When I learned that I was pregnant, I told my partner, in desperation. I didn't want to have it. But he left me. On the Internet I found a feminist girl. She helped me. I didn't want another child because of economic problems and family problems with my kid. Well... It was an experience... I thought about it and I decided what I was going to do. I don't regret it. I know what I did. I'm well aware of what I did and I... I don't regret it. When women end a pregnancy, they don't think about morals, ethics, religion, the Pope, the Bishop or the Rabbi. Women make the decision... It's very interesting, nobody goes to the drugstore and then tells me, "Mario, I used the test. I'm pregnant. Get it out of me now!" It's not like that. The first thing a woman thinks of is the dilemma "Should I have it or not?" And then they think, "Can I have it?" They consider whether they have a partner or not, the number of children they have. They think of the money needed. They consider how they're doing in their jobs. In their career. They consider many factors before making a decision. And I think it's such a big decision, because it's a decision about responsibility. An abortion is an act of responsibility. Having a child is also an act of responsibility. I had six children, and I got pregnant again. Six children, and no money. And bring another child to this world? To give him the least a poor family can give a child? I don't think so. I discussed it with my partner. He didn't want me to have an abortion. He said, "We can raise it anyway. If we can feed six, we can feed seven." And I said no. If we could only feed six, that was it. We could not get their food, or clothes, or medicines when they were ill. So he accepted. I found a woman who performed clandestine abortions. And her price was cheap. She used a catheter and said, "You have to throw it out in 24 hours." One month went by. And I started having hemorrhages. I thought it was because of this clandestine abortion I had had. I didn't pay much attention to it. Until I did, because I was bleeding to death. They took me to Hospital, to the emergency room. I fainted twice. They put me on a stretcher. Honestly, I thought I was going to die. My life was leaving me. I felt I was dying. I kept bleeding, there was no stopping it. And then... I was feeling so weak, I couldn't even open my eyes. A doctor passed by me. And I called to him. I called him with my hand and my weak voice. And he said, "What is it, dear?" And I said, "I'm dying." And he took out the sheet and started crying, "Operating room!" I felt like I was going through a tunnel, quickly, with lots of lights, and that's all I remember. I woke up in a room. A female doctor came and treated me really badly. She said she was there to save lives. She said I was a cunt, a murderer, etc. She insulted me in any way possible. That day I was lucky. I was lucky that day. I survived a clandestine abortion. But I could have died. One day before the vote, youth from the radical party besiege the party headquarters to protest against their senators, most of whom opposed the bill. Tomorrow you will take to the street, we have to give them an answer tomorrow The last day of debates at the House of Representatives, there were over 700 speakers. The last one was really strong. I don't know if it was the sum of everything we had heard, but we are confronted with two approaches. Some people spoke in favor of and others against abortion. One person spoke against the law and showed the face of a 12-year-old girl with a baby in her arms. As if it were a victory for the pro-life people for that girl to have that baby. And for me it was the strongest face of torture, of the violation of the rights of children and teenagers who are forced to carry their babies. They are incapable of feeling empathy with them and accompanying them and respecting their decision. National Congress I tried to attend every hearing, and listened all the time. Many of those who spoke against abortion accused me, maybe they didn't mention me, but they alluded to me and my background, of betraying the memory of my parents. As if the bill meant the "disappearance" of people. Yes, it's so absurd. But they did. It was very difficult. And at that moment, while at that hearing, I said in my speech that a friend gave me a book, "The Handmaid's tale," as a gift. And I thought of my mom. Locked up... My mom was kidnapped when she was 3-month pregnant, and they waited until my birth. I spent 15 days with her and then they took her and today she's missing. She was one of the victims of the "flights of death." That story stills moves me. My mom didn't have a chance to choose and her womb, the result of that womb were spoils of war. To defend clandestine abortions is the same thing. It's not spoils of war but the appropriation of a clandestine system. MU MAGAZINE How's that? Are we all here? OUR LIVES ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE We are here with this bonnet and this cape because we are playing a role from a novel called "The Handmaid's Tale." We say our lives are not negotiable. We demand legal abortion. We are not talking about just a State. We are talking about a right. And that right is not negotiable. Is that clear? We want total access to health care services. That's what we are saying. Legal abortion now! Legal abortion now! Legal abortion now! Legal abortion now! Legal abortion now! La Ceramica neighborhood I am Lu. I'm 25 years old. When I was 6 years old, my mother's partner started touching me. Before I was 7, he was abusing me sexually. When I was 12, my mother found out because I didn't have my period, and she blamed me for everything. Her partner had always beaten me. Once he almost killed me. My mother made me feel guilty. As if I had provoked him. She wanted me to have the baby, to lock me until I gave birth and pretend it was hers. Or give it up for adoption. One day I met a girl who knew a healer. A very old woman. She gave me... I told her I didn't want the baby. She gave me... It was a risky pregnancy for an abortion. But I didn't want it. I didn't care if I died. I didn't want my life, I didn't want that baby. In just a few hours I started bleeding. I was bleeding too much. I almost died at a house where I was being ignored. My mother thought it was a miscarriage. I don't regret that abortion. If I hadn't had that abortion, I would have killed myself. FEMINISM In Argentina, every 26 hours a woman is killed Women are paid 27 % less than men and are twice as likely to live in extreme poverty. They own only 2 percent of cultivable land. I think part of this "Fourth Feminist Wave" is related to womens' bodies. If the female body has always been an intervention body, intervention in wars, in rapes, intervention in the health care system, intervention in the education system to discipline us, to take away desire and pleasure from us... it's time we recover the control over our bodies, over pleasure and desire. And freely. Alert, alert, alert, it is coming the feminist fight for Latin America PARSLEY MARCH CONGRESS SQUARE Chauvinists are afraid Latin America will be feminist Women have conquered rights after many defeats. Women were allowed to vote only 71 years ago. And we had to be defeated many times to get that right. And we can mention other achievements. Until the 80s, we couldn't make decisions regarding our own children. Parental authority meant the control of the father, and mothers could not make decisions. We have been fighting over the years, over decades, because women have always been discriminated against. Senators should listen, look and understand these young people who must not be disappointed by politics. I'm talking about the emergence of young women in feminism. About the feminist demands. Young women do not want to be subordinated to a patriarcal society. And that's wonderful. It's the revolution of the daughters. We will be on the streets We are fighters We will push the Vatican back And abortion will be law You go to sleep We will fight organized against this repressive regime. Feminism is a way of living and seeing the world, and once you see it from the feminist perspective, there is no turning back. You cannot ignore the lack of equality, the inequity, the lack of rights, the huge injustice. Besides, it's transversal. Stigmatization and clandestinity are present in every social class. The same happens with feminism. Women are not considered people with rights by a large part of society. That's the key. When women want to be, want to decide, they are stopped. "You cannot decide." Women are seen by a large part of society, and that's the fight we should go on fighting, as a container. We cannot choose. And considering that we are owners of our own bodies puts a stop to the privileges men have always had in society in general and over womens' bodies. When I am asked to introduce myself, I say I'm married, divorced, a single parent and in a relationship. All "marital status" categories. I'm proud of that. I say that because it's the road I've taken with many women since the 70s, when I was a teenager, until today, when I'm a middle-aged woman, in our path to freedom. Sexual freedom and the freedom to choose are key to defining that road. Because the way to control us in the history of humanity has been to control our sexuality and to make us submissive. Our campaign is for the right to abortion. Once all women and people who can get pregnant have the right, we will do what we want. We will have an abortion or not. But we want everyone to accept that we have the right to make decisions as people and as citizens. Society has supported us in this, so we talk about a social legalization of abortion. And honestly, I love to see how girls have adopted this legacy and are transforming the sexual culture of all society. I think we have been denied the freedom of our bodies, because they are trying to make women private property, something usual in this country. And I feel our revolution in the streets, the revolution of the green handkerchief of the daughters of "Not one less" will change that paradigm and we will not let anyone tell us how to deal with our sexuality. And now that we are all here And now that we are all here And now that they see us And now that they see us Down with patriarchy, It will fall, it will fall Go feminism, we will win, we will win PRO-LIFE We say yes to life, no to abortion. We summon doctor Abel Albino, founder of the Conin Foundation. When I got my degree, I took the Hippocratic oath, I'm a doctor from Tucumán, and I swore to never do anything against life, even at a germinal state. I can't believe it. I feel like crying. Me, a 71-year-old man, I have to come to the Senate to ask Senators not to kill babies. We say yes to life with our light blue handkerchief. Yes to life! NO TO ABORTION Yes to life! LET'S SAVE TWO LIVES Abortion means killing a baby. It's killing a child when he cannot live outside of the womb. So I'm talking to mothers, I'm talking to all women. I praise our Lord not because He made them beautiful but because He gave them all the heart of a mother. I'm talking to that heart of a mother today. Please, don't kill them. In the mother's womb the country builds it's future. Napoleon, Hitler, Vietnam... They were not faith-related wars. In the USA, Dr. Beagley, talks about atheistic systems dancing in this satanic requiem. Regarding abortion after rape, I'd like to quote Alberto Bianchi. Abortion only erases a pregnancy. It does not heal the physical and mental damage. It adds the suffering of having ended a pregnancy. Does abortion, then, make sense? Senators, please reject this bill already passed by the Representatives, and please propose a solution that respects both lives. Abortion will not be less tragic if it's done in an operating room. It will be as tragic and will leave the same sorrow. Let's try something better. Do not give up. I don't think abortion is the only solution, it will always exist. And we shouldn't give up as Senators, because there are many tragedies in Argentina. And the way to solve them is not to give them a place where they can happen with no problem whatsoever. August 8th While the senate is in session, 2 million people take to the streets. Abortion is illegal? What are you saying? We demand there are no more deaths We came from Santa Fe to be in the streets. We know that, no matter what happens in Congress regarding the legalization of abortion, this bill will become law in the streets and that's why we are participating in many activities and today, August 8th, 2018, a historical day in Argentina, particularly for us, women, we had to be here for the bill to become law. Separate the Church from the State! Separate the Church from the State! Separate the Church from the State! These women who came here, whom we can't hear because we are inside, they are in the streets, under the rain, with green handkerchiefs, and they ask us to legislate in their favor, according to their reality, because they want abortion to be legal so as not to die, because motherhood, Madame Speaker, will be desired or will not be. We don't want any more deaths due to clandestine abortions. No more women almost dead due to clandestine abortions. No more women in jail due to clandestine abortions. We want to be able to make decisions regarding our body. Legal abortion is a debt of our democracy. Free, legal abortion now! And priests should work! Come on, girls, we are organized! Sexual education and legal abortion Come on, girls, we are organized! That fabulous youth is in the streets of Buenos Aires. This green wave of girls marching for a fight they have fought for years for the acceptance of equal rights. Not only women's right to live but to make decisions regarding their bodies. And why not? Why are we afraid to talk about their right to enjoy, to enjoy life and to enjoy their body? I'm telling this to the people outside. Do not get caught in the culture of defeat. Bravo, girls! You have raised the honor and the dignity of Argentine women. This cause, tonight, has a brief break. But in a few weeks, girls, you should be fighting again because if the bill is not passed today, we'll insist next year. And if the bill is not passed next year, we'll insist further. Nobody will be able to stop the wave of the new generation. It will become law, no matter what. We will have a general vote. Permission to abstain. Just one abstention? Two abstentions. We'll have a general vote. Voting is in progress. Voting is in progress. Yes. Voting is in process. Let it become law! Let it be law! Negative, 38 votes. Affirmative, 31 votes. For the general voting. It's negative. The bill is rejected. Session is adjourned. Comrades! We made history today. The Senate didn't listen to us, but today we made history. And we will continue making history. We are a wave that can't be stopped. Abortion will be legal. Ana María Acevedo! Present! Ana María Acevedo! Present! -Today... -And every day! -Today... -And every day! -Today... -And every day! Come on, comrades! We'll continue to be in the streets! Legal abortion now! We have already won and we'll resist ...a historical day, fighting in peace, an organized fight, and in the same spirit we invite you to leave peacefully.
