Taxi!- -Not going, not going! You are Raju da, right? Why, are you making me an Adhaar Card? No... Please tell me, it’s important. Yes. I found him! Come fast! Hey! What do you mean? Normal rate. Five Gandhi’s per hour. It’s your first time, so 50 rupees discount. Advance payment, only cash. Yes- -Yes, shall we go? Where do you guys stay? I am from Salt Lake, he is from Maniktala, why? You want me to explain why I asked? If the locals interrupt your action with their reaction, would you like that? No, Raju da, I don’t think you understand. You find this funny? I’ll kick you out right away- -No no please! Raju da please try to understand. Raju da please don’t mind. Please carry on. Wait. I have to take back the place. We’re screwed! What is he upto? Hey you! Raju bhai, just… just five more minutes. Fifty-five minutes, who is that? Hey, you, Shaktimaan! Put on your underwear and sort the rest! Go now!- -Yes, yes! I will go. Hurry up! Put on your clothes!- -There are five minutes left. Hey! What will you do in five minutes! Get out! Raju bhai- -What are you looking at? Out! I’m on it! Please hurry up! Listen, you! An hour is an hour, one hour and a minute is two hours! So, I’m telling you, set an alarm and get to it! Water and condoms will cost you extra. And the seat is brand new. Two hundred per scratch, remember. But Raju da, our need involves you. What exactly do you need? Raju da, it won’t work without you.- -Yes. Hold on. Listen, I’m not into tripling and all that- -No, no... We are here for a serious work. What do you need? But let me tell you, no guarantee, no warranty. We are here to know about your friend. Friend? Which friend? Khelechi. Exactly who are you people? Special branch or something like that?- - No no! Nothing like that. We just wanted to make a movie about Khelechi. You want a cigarette? Have one, please! Look, no one knows about Khelechi. Where he came from, where he disappeared. We have done a lot of research. You were his only friend in Kolkata. That’s why we are here. If you could please tell us the story… so many Bengali football fanatics would get to know their hero. You guys are dangerous, eh? You’ve hit a sixer.- -Please, Raju da. Please. Wait, wait. I’ll tell you everything. Just let me wet my throat. Khelechi’s story can’t be told in a couple of hours. It will take a long time.- -Yes, of course! We have all the time you need. Also, there is money involved. Listen, kid. I’m known as Sheikh Raju in Khidirpur. Raju Banerjee in Chetla. Religion might have no value to me... but friendship does. I don’t need money, I need time. Do you have that? Don’t you worry about time, Raju da. You can begin. Let us go, then. Eh... Have you had anything to eat? I see. Get in! You will be bewildered at what you are about to hear! But keep in mind, it is all real, no stories. The tale begins a few years ago. Before the country went ‘online’, as you guys call it. Back then a taxi meant the good old yellow Ambassador to people. People believed in the word-of-mouth and each other. And it was this faith that brought Khelechi to the city. His full name is Khelechi Agchubi. He was in his twenties back then. He had come from Africa, his first time ever. Doesn’t understand a word of Hindi or Bengali. English is broken, too, like mine. He was in tremendous pressure. It was a life and death situation. Hey, careful!- -I'm sorry. What?- -Can you please get my bag? Take it! Sir, this way sir! -Come, sir! Hello friend! Sir! Sir! Myself Potla Sir! Best hotel, cheap hotel. Sir, you West Indies? You Africa, Sir? I love both, Sir, you come with me! Best deal I give you! Sir!- -No! Please, let me go! Gate number 4! PK’s man. Give them this package, they will take you. And remember, Gate no. 4! Do you have light? [Indistinct chatter] Where brother? PK! I want PK. You know PK? Just landed, and already “PK”! Yes, PK! PK, you know where? Yes, yes. I know PK.- -Okay, take me PK now! Okay okay. Taking you PK. PK will happen. Definitely it will. Hello? How far PK? Relax for PK, bhai! Night is young! Myself young. Pampa, Jhumpa, Shyamoli, Shiuli all young! Eating, drinking; you’ll do it all, okay! Myself Raju, Sir! Not only taxi-driver, but also tourist guide, and supplier. Payment only cash.- -Okay, okay! But I need PK! It will happen, brother. PK will happen. Brother, what is this? PK here, brother. Here?- -Yes, come! Come. What’s up, Uncle? - Hey Raju! Move out. Make space! Brother, sit! 'Boss, in our line of work, 'PK' in the evening can only mean...' 'getting wasted and having a blast!' '...women, music and alcohol...' 'I didn't know the real PK.' -Brother, what is this? Drama-queen! Brother this welcome drinks! PK, PK! PK! Cheers! Brother! Hi, brother, how are you? Hey! Hey- You liar! No money, no PK! Return my money, now! Brother, money gone! But I help brother. One chance, brother, help I help! Ah! -What are you doing? Let him go! Hey, what are you staring at, go! You going PK? -Yes. Damn! What have I gotten myself into? 'Like I said...' 'If I really knew about PK, I could have avoided the brawl on the street' 'And I could've stopped him from going.' Where is he going? 'He handed the driver some money...' 'And the driver pushed him straight into the tiger's mouth.' Go fast, brother, please! Go fast! Take the metro if you’re in such a hurry. Something’s very fishy. Where exactly is he going? Brother! -Oh shit! This Pk house? I want PK. I… friend. Yes. Go straight ahead, then… slightly to the right. Sir! Look over there! Black male with a bag. Won’t you take any action? -Yes sir! Hold Mullick… hold. -Thanks brother Look here, Roger Milla! Where are you headed? I- Khelechi… What now… Khelechi? Where have you played? Brother do you think this is Eden Garden? Who are you? I mean, what purpose visit? This PK house, right? I meet PK... I have package. Who are you? -Yes, he is like the new moon of the darkest night. -Eh, wait, wait. So that means… You are that man! Then… Who is the one inside? Come, mate, come. We have been waiting for you! You come, brother, come. PK inside? Ah, look PK, Chuni, Sailen Manna, everyone's inside. You come with us. Come. Hello. Don't try to butter me... Tell me something. Do you know of someone called PK in your line of work? 'I didn’t know him.' 'But then I did.' 'Prankrishna Dan, aka PK.' 'Son of a zamindar.' 'But calling him a zamindaar of the underworld will not be wrong.' 'He is a man of culture.' 'Has a thing for music and courtroom dancing.' 'He aspires to be a feared drug lord across the country.' You told me to get a black man. At night I could't tell them apart. 'We have a problem, you know.' 'If the man is black, we fail to tell them apart.' 'To us, they're all the same.' 'I've made that mistake myself. The goons would definitely do the same.' 'It is unfair.' 'At the end, it was he who had to bear the brunt of their confusion.' 'He imports and exports drugs across borders right under the cops’ noses.' 'But one thing is certain.' 'the delivery person disappears after completing the delivery.' 'Their bones float down the Ganges.' 'Pancha.' 'He is both PK’s right hand, and his voice.' 'Due to his habit of chewing betel, no one can decipher what he says.' 'Except Pancha.' Dark. -Yes? No matter how dark. You should have noticed the black-deer eyes! Dumb— boy. You? Or him? You? No. You? Or you? No. You! -PK da! Our man is here! Hey! Hey! Catch that son of a bitch? Hey— Hey wait! Wai— wait! Sir, now you have to take action. Should I call the force? Start the car? Hold. How much longer, Sir? It is not pee! Not like this, Mullick. We have to catch them in the act. Wait. Hey! 'Having the prize slip away from your grasp is something PK cannot deal with.' 'So he let all the dogs out after Khelechi.' Hey catch the bastard! Don’t lose him! 'To save the hero from the jaws of the tiger, comes another hero.' 'I mean, me.' Brother! Brother! Get inside! Get him! -Go fast, fast! How could you let him go!- -Taxi! 'Hero, hero's brother, villian, we've seen them all.' 'Now it is time for the heroine.' 'Banalata Sen.' 'Bonny for her friends. Lata at home.' 'She's from the suburbs.' Bonny! Boss is calling you to his cabin. 'She too has a lot of stress.' 'Her father has one condition.' 'Either settle with a job at a major publication within six months...' 'Or, settle with a homeopathy doctor from Birati.' Sir, may I come in? Bonny? Come in. I was waiting for you. Sit! Did you get any break? Sir, I will in a couple of days. Couple of days? So much can happen in a couple of days. Like you being replaced by a smart reporter. In a couple of day World War Three could commence. Couple of days. Couple of days… A lot more can happen in a couple of days. We could become friends. We could go on a long drive sometime. Mondarmoni. Where... We can get... Steady, steady. We can get real close and personal. Then... And next Monday, you’d get your confirmation letter. I am saying that, a couple of days can be spent like this too. Mondarmoni. If I don’t get any breaking news by 6pm today... You don’t have to come from Monday. Remember that. Hey! Come out. Hey, Come out! Come out! Out! Out! Stand. What is problem? Why you go there? Why were they chasing you? Why people... run your back? Where are you going? What inside bag? Money, gold… what is it? Football? You come here for this? Football you get… You buy Maidan Market. Inside football. What do mean inside football? Gas? No. Not gas. It’s heavier than I expected. What inside, brother? My future. What do you mean? What does this have to do with future? No, no... Means...say true… say truth. What inside? My name is Khelechi Agchubi. Unbelievable? Unbelievable? But here you are standing before me. What? Damn! No, no, no, no nothing. You please continue bio-data. My name is Khelechi Agchubi. I’m from Senegal. Poor country in Africa. My momma very ill. I need money for surgery. I deliver this to PK and collect money. And return ticket to..to Africa. Inside this football… Drugs. Drugs?! Ah, so that’s why he had gone to PK. Please help me, brother. 'Once I become emotional, there's no holding me back.' 'I should've asked him to scram. But what I said was...' You’ve called me your brother. If I can’t pull you out of this hole, my name is not Raju. Raju is not your name? Damn it!! I..I.. I means… I— I swear on brother, okay? I help you brother. I help you. I help you. You did not allow me to steer the boat. You did not allow me to steer the boat. Neither did you hand me the oars. You are the sailor of my heart. You are the sailor of my heart and the mast too. I depend on you to get across. You are my beginning and my end. Where do you need to go? Wherever you want. You are the owner of this world. You are ever merciful. You are ever merciful. I can take the pain of the thorn. I can take the pain of the thorns. I am not used to the caress of the flowers. You are ever merciful. 'Now I gave my word that I'll help. But how, I don't know.' 'At a time like this, I run into Bonolata.' 'An idea came into my head, all of a sudden.' 'Kolkata means football and football means Kolkata.' 'Seven days from now, there is a life-or-death match between Young Bengal and Notun Bagan. Big match.' 'Derby.' 'And Khelechi from Africa has arrived in Kolkata just in time.' 'What if I can change the game?' Ahh!! Oh, sorry, sorry madam, sorry. I was watching so, I didn’t notice. Sorry, eh? So, you’re reporter or something, right? Yes. For now. So you tell me. Such a legendary footballer has landed from Africa. And no one knows about it? What do you mean? Legendary player? How big exactly? What are you saying? Do you follow the Youth World Cup? Khelechi was at his best then. So what is a Youth World Cup player doing in Kolkata? Now that is the real question, madam. He was told that a life without a single match played in Kolkata is a wasted life. So he packed up and left for the city. The question is; which club will he play for? Notun Bagan or Young Bengal? Both the coaches are swooning over him. Full mad. Ready to pay any amount to make him play for them. But my brother has not yet decided. So… how did you come to know him? Are you underestimating me because I’m a taxi driver? No no… that’s not what I meant. - It's okay, it's okay madam. You’re only doing your job. So here it goes. Several years ago, one of his countrymen I forgot his name, you know how hard their names are! Holoki Amloja. He had played for Young Bengal for a year or so. I took him on a city tour in my taxi. We became friends. He spoke highly of me back in his country, so! Oh! 'At that very moment, if she had looked it up instead of taking my word for it...' 'Then you would have never been here today!' 'She fell for it!' I was saying, could you please secure an interview for me, brother? Please? Why is she calling me dada? Huh? -It’s nothing! Uh… you said interview, right? Interview can be arranged. But you have to keep a low profile. You know, underwater. Why undercover? He is a simple boy. Slightly… what do you call it? He is a little shy. Oh! Introvert! Yes, that. I am asking you beforehand, can I take a picture? Thank you! Could I get your name? Myself Raju madam. Only Raju. When and how do we go about the interview? Thank you! Thank you! Raju, eh? Only Raju. No brother. In order to be a good reporter, you'll have to dig 'inside' the news. Where? -Inside... Absolutely! Are you getting me? You? Sir, it’s five minutes to six. Yes, so? Did you get any breaking news? Yes sir. You did? I can't swim. I can't swim and the shore appears blurry to me. It's a challenge that I need to overcome and hence I beg for your mercy. Don't turn away from me. You are my beginning and my end. If you take away everything after granting me life, then how do I survive? You are ever merciful. Who will Khelechi play for? Who will Khelechi play for?- -Khelechi? Who is that? Khelechi?- -Yes, Khelechi. What did he play?- -Not yet. He will. You just said he played.- -His name is Khelechi. Who is going to play? Khelechi. I gaze at my destiny from off shore, no matter where I look I find you. Khelechi! Huh? Six months ago. That too for two minutes. Khelechi! Huh? No matter where I am, I need you... Khelechi will play for our team Oh please! We are the national club. We have a history. You do! That history is about the time you fled! But this Derby is somewhat special. And the debate around this Derby is somewhat heavy. Why? Because Khelechi Ajgubi! This foreign player is yet to decide which team he will play for. Our reporters are presently in the far corners of the city to present to you the opinion of the fans on this much awaited match. Zee 24 Ghonta has reached every nook and cranny of the city to find the answers to one question; Who will Khelechi play for? Khelechi is like our son! Khelechi will play for Notun Bagan! Khelechi will play for Young Bengal! Young Bengal? Is that a team, even? Kolkata football means Notun Bagan.- -Have you gone mad? Khelechi will play for the local club only! Khelechi is so handsome! I love Khelechi. East the West! Khelechi the best! Make a long pass! What are you doing? I can’t believe my luck! Look who I put my trust on, undeserving! Do you even understand man-marking, bastard? Derby is in five days and here you are standing in the same place! Play for under 10!- -Sir! Have you heard the news of Khelechi? Sir! Sir! Sir! They won’t even let me eat in peace. Do tell. Mr. Kar, word is out that you are trying your best to buy Khelechi. Meanwhile Young Bengal has already begun preliminary talks? If you can’t bring him into the team by morning Then I will send you to Bongaon to look after cows! Mind it!- -Yes, sir. Damn the news! Who is the national club? Us. Then? Such a sought-after World Cup player will play for a small fry instead of the national club? We can’t let that happen.- -Absolutely not. Then? Shall I eat? -Yes, sir. Sir! Sir! Sir!- - Sir, Sir! Sir! We got the report that you are excited to buy Khelechi. The other team's coach was saying that they have finalised him already! Nothing like that has happened! Why do you pay heed to baseless rumours! When were you born? Yesterday? You're trying to be oversmart! Sir, But…- -Shut up! No buts! Khelechi will play for our team, and that is the point! Good morning brother! Good sleep? Where you going? How much more will you yawn? Get ready. I’ll come with you?- -Yes. But where? Brother, new party coming. Young girl, wants to make a movie I mean..., film, film. Smooth, eh? Full city tour, you come. Okay, I come. Khelechi da? Please take to one? One more? Very Spicy. But good, I’ll have one more.

Hey, give me some more curry. Short pass! Short pass! All this lollygagging won’t do! Where did you find these specimens? Brazil, or Motijheel. Let go of this Brazil, eh? Mitin, listen.- -Yes, Sir. I want Khelechi.- -Sir... Or I will make you go on trial under the scorching Puruliya Sun. For the rest of your life, remember that.- -Okay, Sir. Why are you hyperventilating?- -No, no.. Do you have asthma, or what?- -No. Madam, sorry madam, sorry madam. We are late.- -No problem. It’s okay!- -Get in! Not a problem. Good morning madam! Everything okay? Let me introduce you. My brother from other mother, Khelechi. Hi Khelechi! I’m Bonny, so pleased to meet you!- -Bonny madam. Nice to meet you too. Shall we? His name is Khelechi. And he has come here to play. I landed from Africa. Without a penny in my pocket. With love for my mumma, firing me on like a rocket. Do you have Munna Aziz? Mohammad Aziz? He is from Rajabazar. -No brother. This place is nice. Only music. Mama used to sing to me when I was little. Good times. Oh, how sweet. Where is your mama now? And on and on and on and on I run... All my life. And on and on and on and on I run... Oh my life. And on and on and on and on I run... All my life. When one chase stops the other has just begun. Go brother. Stop, no shooting, no shooting, please! Madam, are you done? Brother, all very good, go? Well life's a roller coaster, I ain't bought No idea where it will take me, no clue if I will make it. As I close my eyes and I offer up a prayer... Lord, please, look out for me and my mumma who is not here... When I get outta this mess. Hey, what is he called? Khelechi! No, he is a lookalike. No, it’s him! Well my baby can fight. So I gotta soldier on... Hey, get lost! Coz, my mumma waiting for me. I must fight this fight alone... Oh she means the world to me. It's okay brother, just give one more plate, please. And on and on and on and on I run... And on and on and on and on I run... All my life. That was not funny, Bonny madam. Hey, brother, you see a woman and you lose it? Oh, look at him blushing. Let's go! 'Our friendship was strong, but it was built on a lie.' 'If we had 4G back then, our friendship's data-pack would be long expired.' You know, when I was young... I always wanted a brother. My brother. My baby brother. Erebus took him. He was only seven. Never knew my father, where will the brother come from? So many people lost their families… but I was lucky. I had a Papa. I had a Mumma. Home, family, there was nothing. Nothing, brother! Only one thing has kept me going, you know. This city. So many people changed there colours right before my eyes. Only this city hasn’t changed. When I was a child... I wanted to be a footballer. Footballer? Footballer? Seriously?! Every Sunday morning after church. We used to play football until sunset. Brother. Sunday morning football. Yeah.- -Yeah! Yeah. Sunday morning football Raju possible organise! Organize? Yes! From organizing festivals to last rights, Raju is capable of all. Okay, brother, okay. Okay?- -Okay! Okay! Very good brother. 'Even while drunk, I had decided.' 'I will secure him a place at the Derby.' 'Among so many lies, I could still see the truth.' 'No matter how he started, I will make sure this ends on a high note.' PK da, let it be, PK da. He is dumb. Let it be. He is dumb. Is this some kind of joke? Is this a joke— Sorry. You can’t do a single job properly. I gave you a picture, but you still got the wrong man. It was new moon yesterdey. Darkness ruined it. Now I’ll make you witness the New Moon, okay? The buyers will come tomorrow, we have to collect the goods by then. If you don’t get it, I’ll make you all dance naked! Remember this! Dada, could I get a better picture? This one… is slightly blurry, I can’t tell. Why? You want to get married? Dumb— Boy. Go! Get lost! Doesn't understand anything! Go! Good morning, brother! Hangover? Raju? Yes? Raju… why so many people watching here? Bastard.. I told him so many times, not to let them in. Wait. Hey! We want to see Khelechi! I’ll lather up and take a bath, will you watch? Raju da! I want to see Khelechi! Khelechi? I did! I played hard last night. Remind me, I’ll share a video! Get lost! Go on now! Hey, let's go... Go on now! Better, brother? What are we waiting for, let’s go!

Brother, if I join my knee joints will break into pieces. Understand? No! Go, brother. Hey, Pintu! Come here. Go, brother, go! Listen, don’t try anything smart, okay? Khelechi should seem like Maradona. Keep this. Everything okay? It will be done, boss.- -Go! Make him put on a jersey. Hello? Have you arrived?- -Arrived? I’ve been waiting here for ages. Where are you? There will be a tire imprint on my backside now. Get your player on the field. Or is he too shy to play? If someone spots me here, it will hurt my image. No, no sir! A big man like you, if you are seen at the trial, Young Bengal will find out! Sir… please stay on line. Uncle, are you here? I’ve been here as James Bond for so long! I’ve been a coach for so long, but I’ve never seen a trial like this! Thing is, if word gets out that you’re taking a trial... The other coach will find out in five minutes. You’re right. Begin the game already.- -Yes, right away! You stay put. Stay on the line, uncle. The fatty will die after he hears this. Hi, Bonny, madam. Hello, Raju da. Again Raju ‘da’. Die!- -Huh? Hey, what?- -Hello? You’re calling me dead?! Why did you call me dead? Raju! Hello? Madam stay on line. Sir, the other coach is calling me repeatedly. I called him dead! Sir, this Young Bengal coach is bothering me, so I called him dead. Oh, he called the fatty from Notun Bagan dead! He called the coach from Young Bengal dead. Referee! Begin the game already! Madam, you may begin your work. Oh, okay. Did you see that pass, Sir! Oh yeah I did! Fantastic! I can’t believe this! He seems deadly- -Sir! Are you watching? Sir, are you watching! This is not a boy, Raju! He is a Cheetah! Top class! Black Panther! Gianfranco Zola! Go! Go! Goal! Sir, what do you say? Sir, what do you say? He plays like Pele! If we get him, no one can dare stop us from winning the Derby. Goal! Goal! Hello! Don’t worry about the money, Raju. Money won’t be a problem, Raju. Khelechi should play for us and us only. Khelechi will be on my team for the Derby. Thank you, sir! I have to use the loo. Take a break, we'll return to this after. You may speak now. Sir! Sir!- -Thank you! Slow down!- -Sir, will Notun Bagan— One by one. This is a national club! Behave properly, what is this? One by one, please. Mr. Kar, when will you sign Khelechi? We are about to! It will be finalised today itself! Sir, will you sign him before the Derby? What kind of a question is that? Why would I sign him if he won’t play the Derby. Mr. Kar, what is the duration of the contract? For now, its a year. Then.... we’ll see after that. Which position will Khelechi play in? Striker. Striker! Write it down. Sir, now you have to take action! Hold Mullick, hold. The game has just started. Cheers! Feeling better, brother? Better, brother? Yeah, man, better. What happened, brother? What happened? What better, man? No money. No ticket. And in some days, my momma is no more. I need to go to PK. I need to give package, I need to collect money. But I feel scared. I feel scared. Brother, I tell, everything alright. Raju's promise, assured promise. No lies. Okay? You wait here. Brother, look, what inside, look! Take out, take out, look! What is this? Brother! Brother! This... this special dress, brother. Pure cotton Panjabi. Wear, wear! But, why wear this, brother? Oh, c’mon, sometime back you were ‘how-how’ and now you’re ‘why-why’? Just wear it! By the way — Brother. Money? But, where you get, brother? Brother… this only little money, not many… more coming. This only visiting fees and also in the menu is mutton biriyani. Come brother, let's go, come. Friends, I have never had the privilege to witness Pele first hand. Neither have I seen Maradona. Today we have seen Khelechi, it is such an honour!- -Applause! 'The poor guy couldn't figure out the circus that had commenced over him.' 'He trusted only me.' Everyone in my ward is honoured to see Khelechi! -Smile please! From remote Africa he has arrived just for us! Brother, good? Eat with hand. Jino Da, have you done her makeup? -Yes, I have. Okay. Brother, I have very nice picture! Show me. What a look. Looking like Sharukh and Kajol. C’mon! Come on?- -Nah. Welcome to Zee 24 Ghanta. I am your host Rubela. Present with me at the studio at this very moment...

Nah.. c'mon, nah.- -Brother, no brother. You. You... Hello! Seriously?! Congratulations. No, no, I won’t say anything, this will be a surprise. See you at lunch, bye bye. Sometimes my heart wishes to fly. Sometimes I smile without reason. Sometimes I talk to the mirror. Sometimes I hum to a tune. I can't make out if it is my desire for you or your very presence that makes my heart flutter. It makes my heart flutter. It makes my heart flutter. I feel beautiful and I laugh for no reason. My carefree heart flutters at the very mention of your name. I don't know why my heart is so restless. I don't know why I am getting intoxicated by you. It makes my heart flutter. It makes my heart flutter. It makes my heart flutter. I don't know why I am getting intoxicated by you. It makes my heart flutter. It makes my heart flutter. I’m full, you order. It’s okay.- -No, no! You’re my guest, you have to have something. Okay, let me order for you.- -Order, ma'am? One plate of fish balls, one coffee and one iced tea. Regular water. Sure...thank you ma'am! -Thank you! Wait! Hello, where are you? No I haven’t said anything. Yes, hurry up. I’ve got a… gift for you.- -For me? Thank you. Do you like it?- -It’s really nice. I'm keeping it here. You should really try this, it’s very nice, very famous in Kolkata. And try this with this yellow sauce- kasundi. I’m sorry. Have some water, I know it's a little spicy. Zee24 Ghanta welcomes you. I am Rubela, in our studio, with our viewers. With me at the studio today is a person involved in journalism for a long time. We would like to invite Banalata Sen. Welcome to Zee24 Ghanta's studio. Our viewers have only one question; who will Khelechi Ajgubi play for? I can't tell you which team he is playing for. He himself hasn't shared it yet. You liar! You think I’m a fool? I trusted you, Bonny. And you used me. I trusted you, Bonny. And you used me. I know I lied to you. But it’s for your good! I mean you’re a big footballer- -What football? You’re a big footballer. You’re going to play at the Derby- -What Derby? What footballer?! This is bullshit! I’m not a footballer! What are you saying? You are a footballer. Raju da told me- -Just shut up, Bonny, just shut up! But Raju da told me- -What Raju?! But Raju da said that you’re a big footballer- -Yeah, tell me. You’ve played the World Cup, you’ve come to Calcutta for trials and you’re going to play in the Derby and... Oh my god, Raju!- -And, he’s you’re agent! He was lying the whole time.- - He asked me to keep my identity confidential. I'm a fool- -I’m so sorry Khelechi. I’m so sorry. I thought of him like a brother!- -Khelechi… This Raju… I’m going to kill him! Oh… shit! Shit! Hey, brother! Where you going— Hey! You bloody liar!- -What now? You lied to me!- -What happened? You lied to Bonny, you didn't tell me she is a journalist.- -What happened, brother? I trusted you!- -What happened!? I… I do this for you! I do this for you, brother. For mother. One match only! Money giving. I… I may be a swindler but my friendship is real. Brother! How could you do this? You lied like this? He is not even a footballer! Now… Madam! 'The friendship was true.' 'But the lie that it was based ripped everything apart.' Madam!- -Isn't that Khelechi? Dada, Khelechi will play for which club, dada? Please do tell! My father has a club, he is playing for that club. Do you have a problem? Get lost! Stop! Stop! Hey get in... Come! -Raju da! Lift him. Hold him. Got him. Start the car. Raju da! Let's go. Hey stop! Let me go. Raju da! Pancha! Pancha he is moving! Pancha! Look, he is awake. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hello! I know... You play Derby tomorrow. Tonight, you are my guest. Give me the package. I’m best.

I only know, foreign party coming… Goods exchange is must. Or else you go… Nimtola. Very fast. You call Raju. Telephone, telepathy… your choice. After two hours, my choice. Ah, good voice! I failed… I failed you, mother. I failed you. Drugs!? Fate. Now what? I’ve given my word and I will die for it. But I won’t let anything happen to Khelechi. There is a way. Back in school, did you ever act in plays?- -Yes, why? Your acting skills might come in handy. How?- -I’ll explain. First, I have to acquire some favours. Get in! Hello, Raju da? Of course, Raju da. I can do this much for you. No, I broke up with him. Left me! There is a new piece available. Should I bring him? Hello, Raju da! Hello? I’m always be there for you. Madam... Junior artists have assembled. You are the heroine, okay? What? Me?- -Yes. Yes. Bollywood film director, well-known. You have a big bangla film lined up for the Pujas. And Dan Bari will be the prime location. Come. Come, come to me. Take that! Who has come at this time? Bullshit. They have nothing to do, turning up at odd hours. Finally! Come in, come in! This is the house, the famous zamindaar house— How dare you walk into the house like this! Who’s he? - -Tell your name. Pancha! This is the great Pancha! The only caretaker of the famous Dan Bari. Hello, hello. Who is she? What did I do? You don’t know her? - - No! Bollywood’s famous filmmaker, Bonika Chopra. Film… - - … maker! Oh! I mean, I haven't been introduced to her.- - Not a problem. Okay, have you watched, ‘Dilwale Dulhania Nehi Le Jayenge’ ? 'Nehi'? - - Correct! Bonika Madam! Have you seen ‘Kuch Kuch Nehi Hota Hai’ ? No! - - That's Bonika Madam! Oh... Okay I get all that. But, who are these people?! Actually... ...after five diamond jubilee hits Five? - - Yes, five. This year she thought of a bangla movie. Bangla?!- - Bangla! Big Bengali movie!- - Big Bengali movie! Yes, big Bengali movie!- - Okay! Pujo release.- - During puja? Prime location is a zamindaar's home.- - Okay. When I heard of it, I said, In Kolkata only two zamindaar homes, One Thakur Bari. And one Dan Bari. Correct!- - Correct? Now, they were all bored looking at the Thakur Bari.- - Exactly! So I brought them here to show them Dnaabari.- -Well said. What is happening here?- - Damn it! Oh no! Dada! I told them not to disturb you. They wouldn’t listen. They just barged right in! 'No matter how dangerous PK is...' 'He too fell for the 'pretty-woman'!' Go. Go! They just high-fived! Perfect! It stood up! I mean the movie is finally coming together! You don’t understand what’s happening? I do. In the movie, the main character is that of the Zamindaar. I think madam has found the hero for that role! What luck, eh? Location scouting led us right to the hero! PK da as hero? He looks like a villain! He called him a dumb boy. What a face... What a body! This is a star! He’s perfect! Your name? I’ll tell you, Poran Krishna... Yes, PK da. Only PK. Oh! Only PK. Okay. Now it’s definitely up! The role. Cousin! He is my aunt’s son! Where are the rest of you? Take it from him! Yes, take it. Ah, profile! Photograph. Ah, profile! Take his pictures! Yes, take it.- -I wanna see the house. I see! I see! What? The secret room... I, sir, please come. Come. Madam see house, madam.- -Please wait. Come, come. Please come, this way! Come. This is private. And this is public. Good ventilation… Air is coming. Very nice. But I was thinking… if PK will be there…- -Yes, on the terrace! camera should be here!- -That way, right? We’re screwed. Madam, I tell you, private. Actually, Bhadrokali Puja is just round the corner, so PK da has kept him. For human sacrifice. Please talk. Great Pancha says… PK foreign friend… health to not very good. -Not good! Okay… what’s there?!- -Don’t go that way, madam! Madam listen to me! I’m untying you, do what you can. What’s in… aah!- -Listen madam... You can’t be in this room, go out.- -What happened?! Oh! Another guest?! PK da appears to be very popular in foreign land.- -Yes, yes, now you may go out— I need to… see you… in more light!- - What is this? In the veranda! PK da appears to be very popular in foreign land.- -Yes, yes, now you may go out— Balcony! Balcony!- - Balcony! Balcony! Darling!

Yes… I got that. I mean, once the cinema is complete, you will become number one! Top! Top! Top! Go upstairs and find out what caused the power cut and what they are doing upstairs! Hey, let's go!- - Okay, okay let's go. It’s too goddamn dark here! Can’t see a thing! Where did they go? Got him! I got him! You’ve nowhere to run! How will I run if you hold me like this?! Haba, you! Go search above, I’ll go downstairs.- -At the sky? Not that above! Go upstairs and look! Go! Just go! It's so dark. Come brother, let’s go!- -Hey! Thank you madam. Get up! Let's go! Let's go. 'Regardless of the trouble at hand, PK, the boss, kept his hands folded.' 'And we got down to the task.' Who’s there?- -It’s me… No, no! Not you! What is that behind you in the darkness? Something is moving. What was that sound? Dada… you stay put. It came from the stairwell… Haba position… position! Haba, look out! Stay in position.- -Careful. It’s moving again! Take your position. Ready? Ready?- -Be very careful. Hey bastard, now where will you run! I got you! I got you! There was this gust of wind that went by me.- -I have not let the wind pass, Dada! I can recognise the smell. This is my black diamond. Sir, should we still hold?! The real game is tomorrow… Hold, Mullick, hold. Sorry Dada… sorry sir. Looks like the new moon had me fooled, too. All because of him! You started the game, now I will end it. Football… do you like it? Ah, yes. But I’m out of practice! I might be a little rusty. We won’t play… We won’t play… We will watch! The big match, Derby! I will see... which team that Khelechi plays for... Which team will Khelechi play for in today’s match? The Derby will commence in a few hours…- -The boy couldn’t decide till now! No idea what will happen… Hey, bring me some tea! Khelechi Hilsa! Khelechi Hilsa! Dada, today 20 rupees per plate? Khelechi will have my kachoris before his Derby match. You'll have to spare some change to get a taste of this delight. Dada… it says here Khelechi will play for Young Bengal!- -What?! Yes. Bad omens in the morning! Tsk! Look, Lord, Khelechi should play for our team only!- -Listen, please have your breakfast? Later, later!- -I never know what happens to him. Today we will win! No one can stop us! No one— Hey, I am the club’s secretary! If you try to do my job for me, I will kick you out! Dada… this way. What do you think? Khelechi will play for us… that is the bottomline! There are no ifs, buts and whys… We have recieved word from within the club. But we have no clue about where he has- -Where he signed up, right? This is called Club tactics before a big match! This is called… what do they call it? Strategy! Pure strategy! AK da has given his word. If Khelechi plays… he will play for our team only! Okay. Okay. This time who will win the Derby?- -Young Bengal will win! As you can see— please calm down— supporters of Young Bengal are overexcited about Khelechi! Sorry. Everyone is going crazy outside! What brother? Why the long face! Brother… Big match starting… Full 90 minutes please giving. Please brother? But I’m not a footballer. I’m not a liar. I will not go. Brother… I know, Raju, not truth… always. But this time… I swear, Raju truth. Please, one last time— Raju... I know you’ve helped me, a lot. But this is too much! I’m not a footballer, no, I cannot go. Cannot! -But Khelechi, listen to him, once! Brother! I do all… I can’t speak in English anymore, I’ll speak in Bengali… -But Raju da he won't- Oh, he will! He will understand! He may not understand Bengali, but he will understand the language of the heart! Brother, listen! I told you before, when I was young, I wanted a brother. I have lied to you so much! But I’m honest about that. I know that I’ve tried to make money by lying about you. What can I do? I grew up on the streets, I couldn’t possibly know more than this! And what else could I do? You guys come to Kolkata to play football! That’s how the public recognises your people! What would I have done, sold you as a footballer, or handed you off to PK like some prey?! Brother. Brother I don’t have a mother. So, I know. I know the pain of losing a mother. That’s why I tell you… You forget about me! I will remain on the streets. You play the match and save your mother! Brother, last time, please! Raju! Dada! Will you take me to the stadium? After that airport. Only by the meter, okay? Thank you! Raju Da... -Yes? Come let's get you dressed. Today is the match day. Zee 24 Ghanta has reached every other lane in the metropolis. Everyone has the same question; which team will Khelechi play for? Viewers, today we are in conversation with Ram Prosad Maity… Namaste. Last night Khelechi demanded that... He will not play the Derby if he cannot have the Kochuri at my shop. I told him! It is not advisable to have Kochuri right before you get on the field. He said that “Eating your kochuri brings new life into my feet!” "Not burps!" -Okay, so... Do you know Khelechi will play for which team? Father… do you want to say anything? Khelechi will play for… which team? Track Raju right away! He is unreachable over the phone. God knows what he uses! It's worthless. Everytime I call, out of reach! Something feels wrong. Something feels wrong! What if the fatty planned something beforehand… Call him quickly! -Yes sir! Tell him that we are prepared to give five lakhs more than what Young Bengal has offered him! Cut it and get to work! -Yes Sir! Get in touch with Raju! Where is he?! That I will do. But will you please tell me the strategy for today? Strategy… Pray to Mother Kaali... That Khelechi plays for us today. Or all these strategies will go out the window. Wait a minute! How could both of you list Khelechi's name as substitute? Khelechi is coming! -You shut up! Khelechi will be playing for our team! Where is your passport, Bangladeshi? Do you even have a passport? 'This is a historic day for our Derby!' 'Both coaches have listed the same player, Khelechi!' 'Can you even imagine? Where is football headed?' You're right! I can't imagine an incident like this! What do you have to say about it? I think we should concentrate on the match that has already started! Forward it! Come, Dada, take your seat! Yes, here. Come sit! Who is this bastard? Yes, yes, I still can't see him. We will see him soon enough! Our men? They are all here! They're there out front, on the other side, in the back. He has nowhere to run! Sit! Sir, PK is in position, now can we get into action? Sorry, sir, sorry. Hold? Ah, shit! Go play with a goddamn lime! -Go, go, go! Yes, yes! Defend it! What have you done? Could you reach him on the phone? What? The fatty is playing games with me. Message. What are you doing? Massage? Do it to your father, dumbass! Send a message to Raju! -Oh, okay sir, I'll do that. 'The game went on...' 'But it felt like the players all have the same question in mind.' 'Who will Khelechi play for?' Scatter about, all of you! They can't pull it off. -Look at that one! What are you doing, standing in one place! Are you deaf or what?! Hey, when is Khelechi going to play? We want Khelechi! Make a long pass! There is Khelechi! Goal! What was that? Is your eyesight okay? Hey, Fatty! You're sitting with your cold drink! If we lose today... We'll drag you around the field and feed you cold drinks! Score another one in the second half. Sir, watch out! Sir, juice? Get out of my face! Playing football? Go! Go to Nicco Park and play Foosball! Idiots, the lot of you! They can't pull it off! Hello? Yes. The money is ready, right? Don't try to outsmart me, I'm telling you! If anything is out of place, Khelechi will play for the rival team. Why is he so late? Just because we are ahead by a goal, call him! -Yes sir! Move ahead! 'Despite the significance of the match, No one had their minds on the game.' 'Everyone had the same question in mind; Which team will Khelechi play for?' Get him! Take a shot! Khelechi has arrived! He is here! He is here! Khelechi is coming! Look! Khelechi! Khelechi is ours. Now save the Derby! Khelechi! Khelechi! -Hey, shut up! What do you need? Wonderful, you have done well! -The money is ready, right? Yes, and what do you want? This cap? Hey, bring it here, fast! Sir! All of it is here! -Thank you! Come on! Hey, old hag! If something happens, the result will not be very good for you! If we lose, we are sending you to your grave! Brother, do your best! Did you see that pass?- -Keep your mouth shut! Welcome to my world. 'The football fanatics of Bengal wasted no time to realize that this is no Maradona.' 'They thought he was just a normal player. And so the crowd got angrier.' Look, Khelechi is losing it so hard! What, you were calling him Pele's son! Where is he now? He is an overrated player. 'I am from Senegal.' 'Poor country in Africa.' 'My mama very ill.' For mother. Money giving! Raju's promise, assured promise. No alterations! After two hours... My choice! Forget about me, I belong to the streets and I am happy that way. You go play the match and save your mother. 'If you hadn't known what happened next, you wouldn't have spent the night listening to me.' Goal! You killed it! Awesome brother! [Indistinct chatter] 'He won the match, he earned the money, he just had one thing left to do...' [Indistinct chatter] 'The ball had a different meaning for PK...' 'But for the public, that was the ball of the Derby's hero!' Sir! Still no action? Hold Mullick, Hold! -Sir, still hold? Hold the thief with the goods! Yes sir! Move! Make way. Got you! 'And just like that, the Derby was saved and millions of hearts were won over...' 'By a player who wasn't just a footballer.' 'He was my brother.' Bonika Chopra! Ah, I get it! No point in being Amrish Puri. I'm going out, do what you will. So... Take care, see you. You too. And come back, please. Yeah, okay. Hey, lovebirds... We should get going, or we'll miss the flight. It's so filmy, right? Thank you, Raju da. You should be thanking Khelechi. It's all because of him. How else would one know about a nobody like me? All these people know me because of him. Because of his friendship. Neither Raju Banerjee, Nor Sheikh Raju. Khelechi's friend, Raju. That is my real identity. So... Are you and Khelechi da... in touch with each other? When the hearts are connected, you need no phone, silly! One minute, it's personal. Hello. How are you? Miss me, brother?
