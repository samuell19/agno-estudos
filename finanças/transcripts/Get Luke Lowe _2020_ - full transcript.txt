Hey guys! My name's Sadie Akafor and welcome to hashtag TV. Today we'll be bringing you fashion, music and gossip. Fuck you and your stupid fucking campaign. No one wants to see another banana-munching monkey filling fucking quotas anyway. If you don't like it, don't get a job in a public fucking profile. Better yet, fuck off back to where you come from, you fucking slag. Cos you see, see I know where you live. And I'm gonna come to your house and pour acid all down your fucking face. The floral crown was a nice touch. It was beautiful. She would've liked the gold roses. Maybe but personally I think they should've gone with red. Your eulogy was erm… a little provocative. (PHONE BEEP TONE) Are you reading the same message? If it's the one that says the world is going to shit, then yeah, reading the same message. His friend's decided not to testify… Not got enough evidence to charge him. They don't have enough evidence to charge the fucker! All that talk of forgiveness after everything he did to her… We should track him down and use those crosses to crucify the fucker. Sounds like you're getting a little bit like GI bitch on me there. Would that be so bad? What if someone finds out? No one will find out. And no one gets hurt? Define hurt. Okay - did you honestly just say to me define hurt?! Are you fucking serious? It won't be anything physical. Eve! Trust me. Evelyn?! Now, Evelyn, I know you might take the opportunity to go wild while your parents are on the Adriatic Coast but there's no excuse for leaving your bin on the footpath all day, is there? No, there isn't. I don't want to seem like a bugbear but you know I take my role on the residents' committee very seriously. And if you let one thing go, there goes the neighborhood. You understand? Yes, of course. So I trust you'll move all receptacles as a matter of urgency? Just as soon as I get home. Excellent. You're looking more macabre than usual. A funeral does that to you. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault, Mrs. Thompson. Friend or family? A very, very close friend. Well, if there's anything I can do. I tell you what, why don't I pop by sometime and whip up a roast to cheer you up? Oh actually, Mrs. Thompson, I don't want to impose. No, no, I don't want you clogging your arteries with all those takeaways. Sure. Excellent. Leave it with me. Okay. Bye. Bye. Yeah, I need to bring it, man, let me just sort something out. Just sort something out for my niece. Hi. Yeah. I can do that. Sure. Why do you always have to dress like you haven't been fucked for the better part of the year, huh? That's really progressive and encouraging. Thank you. Don't get all feminazi on me. I'm just trying to help you. Definitely. Yeah. What the hell is this? You said you wanted to be inconspicuous. OK, so this in that does fulfill the brief of "inconspicuous"? I can do that. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Here. You're one to talk about being discreet. Come on, I mean we both look shady as fuck. Did you do everything I asked? You doubting me? Never. Yeah. Okay. Great. Anything I need to know? Amazing… Yeah. Sometimes it's better not to ask. Okay, this won't do anything for me. So you wanna look pretty for the misogynistic troll who shames women for their looks? No, asshole. Like, if we're not gonna look badass while doing it Then what's the fucking point? Um… judgemental. I need to break our pact. I broke it earlier. Twice. Sort you out. Ready? Ready. (LAUGHTER) Ssssshhhhh. Right, we got everything. We got the rug. Bungees. Okay. You got your bottle yeah? Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, fuck it. Shit! Shit what? We haven't thought of any like code names to use around him. Oh fuck, he can't know our names. We'd be fucked. Seriously fucked. I could be, like, pink. And you could be, I don't know, like blue. I mean, it's a bit derivative. But, fuck, I can't think of anything better. Shit! Shit! He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming Fuck. Oh, fuck he is. Grab your bat. Eve, what are you waiting for? What the fuck are you doing with that?! And I quote: I'm gonna sodomize you with my grandma's kitchen knife collection. Eve! Eve! Oh my god. Shit, shit, shit. Oh my god. Fucking Sadie. Excuse me. Can you help? Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa! What? What do you want? Gi - give me your phone. I'm only gonna fucking block it anyway. What the fuck are you doing?! What's the point in taking my phone and then smashing it up? Ju - Just - Just shut up! Look, you got what you want. Now fuck off. (CRIES OUT) Shit! Shit! You hit me in the fucking face! (SCUFFLING) Take off the fucking mask. Take the mask off. (GROANS) Shut up. Take the mask off. Take the fucking mask off. No! Take the fucking mask off. Fucking.

I'm gonna go get the van, okay, I'm gonna get the van. Fuck. Fuck. Oh my god, Eve, can we just behave like adults, please? Why don't you just put my birthday on blast. Or perhaps the name of my first pet? What the hell are you talking about? Like, you literally hate animals. You're so fucking stupid. I get it. Like I fucked- You do?! I fucked up, okay. Can we just not act like this is Bristol all over again, please? No no no no no! This is not like the time you fucked off with some random guy to rave on some boat on E. This is a million times worse! Not only did you fuck off but he knows my name! Fucking doll fucking eyes. I came, I came there. Oh. I came there. And I was so fucking scared. Like, I was scared, Eve. I was so scared. I was scared… Eve. Mate, I thought my heart was gonna do an alien right out my chest. Right! Right. I fucking stuttered. I can't believe I fucking stuttered. Don't be so hard on yourself. It definitely called for a stutter, okay. You did so good. Seeing him knocked out on the floor was fucking worth it though. Okay, that was a little Aileen Wuornos. Okay. Is that okay there? Can we leave it there? Shit. Okay, if you do those ones. Grab underneath. No underneath. No, I can't- Underneath. I need a light! Okay. I can't fucking see what I'm doing. Please. Does this work? No… Yes, I guess it will have to do. Oh my god. It's gone out now. Right. Again. Ready? It's fine. Jesus fucking christ! Put the fucking light out. What's going on? What's going on? You ask me to put the light on and then you ask me to put the light off. Oh my god, Eve. Answer the fucking door. Hi! Good Evening, Evelyn. You look familiar? Oh, I'm just a friend. Everyone calls me Bo- Everyone calls me B. Hi. What lovely cheekbones. You remind me so much of my daughter. Thanks. Now, Evelyn, you know I'm not one to cause a fuss. But your van is blocking two cars here which is a violation. I'm sorry um. Yeah, we're so sorry. We just had to park here for a couple of minutes. There were no spaces. Yeah. It's okay. No harm, no foul. What's that? It's a … a new rug. Uh… it's a second-hand rug. Well, which one is it? A new rug. A new rug. You brought back a rug at this time of night? The delivery fees were criminal. That's an interesting choice of word. It looks rather bulky, doesn't it? Yeah, it's Persian. Why don't I help you with that? Oh. Okay. Yeah, I mean if you could just check the sort of space… …there, Dorothy. And um check the rug. You get the … You just try and get the thing. Okay, one minute. You just get that. Just turn around.

I have an audition tomorrow. I'm super nervous right now. Shall we? Yeah. You girls, your lives are so glamourous. You and your television commercials and TV shows. That's awfully heavy. What have you got, a body in there? (FORCED LAUGHTER) How can I help you? I've got the uh… the keys in my pocket, Dorothy. If you just open the door. If you can like open the door. Of course. Of course. That would be a great, great, great help. (WHISPERS) Ready to go? Okay, last stretch. Three, two. Wait. Wait. Go. Go. Go. Build the strength up in those arms. Thank you. Oh dear. Oh dear. Wait. Oh, careful. Oh dear. What's happened to your eye? Oh my god, Dorothy. I heard there's like this super awesome documentary on channel thirteen and it started like five minutes ago. You should go watch it. Are you trying to get rid of me? No, it was so good to see you. Bye. See you soon. Bye. (WHISPERS) Fuck off. Okay. Go go go go go go. Step. Step. Let me just drag. You get the door. Has she gone? She gone? Okay, she's gone. (STRAINING) I hate her. She's insane. Walk. Okay. I can't believe she saw that. We're fucked. We're not fucked. We're fucked. We're not fucked. Seriously, I don't need you to spin this right now. Okay. I need a fucking drink. Can you get me a chair? No, I can't breathe right now. That's it. Deep breaths. Right. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Fuck. Shit. Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck. No risk, huh, Eve? It's just a little glitch, that's all. A little? This is your problem. Like, you're constantly getting obsessed with these radical ridiculous ideas and then jumping in headfirst without fucking thinking. Name one occasion. Um - at uni, when you nearly got kicked out for graffitiing the teacher's car because he called Harriet Tubman angry and overwhelming. Okay, okay. Name two. Help! Help! Oh! The fucker bit me. Help! Quick. Get that. Help! Quiet asshole! Stop, let me just get his head. Get me- Ssshhh sshhh sshhh sshhh sshhh. Bonnie, Bonnie, my hand. Where did he bite you? Where did he bite you? Fucking christ. Jesus christ. Nothing physical! Okay. Okay. Eve! Starting from now. Starting from now. Okay, so- I say we just roll him back in the rug dump him at that fish market thing and let the morning traders take care of him. Think about it. He's seen my very distinctive hair when I followed him and at the crime scene. And now he's seen yours too. Like, yes, less distinctive, but he's seen it. And he knows your name. Eve! Eve! Hm. Oh my god. If I have to say sorry for that one more fucking time I'm gonna lose it. Okay? He's heard our voices. Get off her, you fucking asshole. Plus, your weird-ass neighbor who acts likes she's been shitted out the ass of MI5 Saw us on the night of the abduction with a van and a rug she joked was heavy enough to contain a dead body. That was pretty funny though. And she saw that someone's gone Nicola Adams on your eye all of which can be corroborated by him. Plus your DNA is probably all over his teeth. So we pull out his teeth. Oh my god. What about your neighbor though? Like, what are we gonna do? Like, dump her in the River Thames? Oh, come on! We've got the fucker that tortured Sadie to the point that she took her own life. I say we make the best of it. Improvise. Adapt to our environment. Darwin. Shit happens. I ching. Whatever man. We gotta roll with it. What the hell are you talking about? Collateral. Tom Cruise. Oh, I love Tom Cruise. Look, I say, I say we stick to the plan. We've got a week until my parents get back to get him to confess to what he did to Sadie And to all those other women. Look, when the confession gets out we'll be the last thing on his mind. And then- we dump him. If we do it now, we're fucked either way. Yeah? Game face. Um Eve? Just give me ten seconds. Eve. Five? Eve! Fine. (MUFFLED WORDS) Hello Luke. (MUFFLED WORDS) I'm gonna remove the gag now. And if you scream I'm gonna dip your tongue in a bowl of hot oil and count to ten. Understood? See, that doesn't look like a nod to me. (MUFFLED RESPONSE) Yeah, that's better. Who the fuck are you? … Huh? What's this all about? I want to play a game. Let's call it 'confession'. We want you to confess to all the sins you've committed under the avatar snowflake avenger I dash D dash N. (MUMBLES) Sshh Sshh Sshh. You see, it's simple really. We want you to admit to all the women whose accounts you've hacked and gone on to release their nude pictures. To all the people you tortured and humiliated online Like: Ruby Daniels Alexandra Roth Sadie Akafor Georgina Chang Katrina Thompson You confess and we let you go, simple. You know I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Bullshit. It's not bullshit. You've got the wrong guy. Oh. Oh no. Okay. Um… I guess you need some encouragement then. I'm not gonna fucking admit to something that I haven't done, am I? Let's have it your way. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, you gotta- You can't keep- Hey! You wanna fucking hurt me?! I need to piss. (WHISPERS) Oh my god. I need to fucking piss. Ready? I guess I'll just take care of this then. Yeah, I guess so. Sunshine, I reckoned she liked that. What about you? You'd have to ask her yourself, snowflake. Have you ever heard of The Devil's Glitch, Luke? No. According to the Guinness Book of Records It's the longest song ever recorded. Clocks in at sixty-nine minutes. Sixty-nine. Wouldn't it be interesting to listen to that? Hm? But you know what would be more interesting? Listening to a much shorter song over and over and over again. Headphones. This is your last chance. You think you'll break me? You'll cave first. Challenge accepted. Is that supposed to happen? Absolutely. Only we get to decide when these come off. Unless you got something you want to admit? (MUFFLED RESPONSE) No? Okie dokie then. We're gonna need some tape. (MUFFLED CRIES) Who's that? Thanks. I told you, you got the wrong guy. She's looking for someone to hate. I'm not him. (HUMMING) We are this close to him cracking and fessing up. I can feel it. There's a ton of people using this snowflake avenger handle online. And? So we have nothing concrete to prove it's actually him. Neither do the police, so. Except the fucker called me sunshine. Hot climates, Africa, the Caribbean. Maybe he was just commenting on your sunny disposition. I've been researching this music punishment shit. That's the spirit. Pick up any tips on how to make it more efficacious? The UN considers sensory deprivation inhumane. (GURGLES) Prisoners have lost their minds. Complete loss of mind is not what I was aiming for But it might be a nice by-product. Eve, stop. I say we just try something else. And I say sympathy's a serpent that will lead you astray. But whatever. Let's try it your way. Eat. Eat. You're the other one, aren't you? Yeah. Where's that other little ray of sunshine? Fuck you. There she is. Luke, do me a favor, and like stop calling her sunshine, okay? Why? She finds it offensive. Everyone's such a fucking snowflake these days. You know what I mean. Listen, why don't you do me a favor And take this blindfold off me for a minute? Huh. How long have I been here? Three days. You wanna sort me out with some drugs? I'm fucking dying here. Careful what you wish for. Shut the fuck up. Luke, I know what you do online like isn't a true reflection Of who you are as a person. Like I know your mom raised you better than that. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. She did. Don't talk about my mom. You don't know her. Having met you, I'd say she's a fucking bitch. Luke, all we want is for you to admit what you did to those women Promise you'll never do it again and we'll let you go. Darling, I told you before I haven't done anything. You see, darling, I don't get why you do it? Why do harass people that have done fuck all to you? I've got a dog that ain't been fed in three days, you know that? And I've got a period due in three days. Answer the fucking question. Ain't it supposed to be good cop time? This isn't working. Let's just put the headphones back on and wait it out. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't do that. Don't do that. You know what you have to do. You know what? Go ahead. It's only gonna expose you liberal warriors for the hypocrites you really are. Hypocrites? Yeah. Okay. Hypocrites. You walk around so smug. Like you've always got the moral high ground. Talking to people like they don't know what's good for them. You got fucking dykes on TV trying to turn men into cucks. Foreign fucking termites breeding up a fucking storm Taking our jobs and our houses. You know, I lived on those streets when I was seventeen. Four years. I didn't get a job. I didn't get a house. No one gave a fuck about me. No one listened to me. But now, now I got thousands and thousands of people that listen to every word I say like I'm god. So fuck you. There's your confession. And what about what you did to those women? (DOORBELL) (MUFFLED) Help! Help! (VERY LOW MUFFLED CRIES) (MUFFLED CRIES) (WHISTLES) What are you doing!? Making a point. Gag him. (DOORBELL) Maybe we should just like invite her in For a cup of English breakfast tea and a biscuit. Hm. What are you still doing with that? Well, it worked, didn't it? You're insane. Ew. Are you getting this from Sadie's sister? Fuck! Good evening, welcome to LM News. Our top story. Founder of men's rights group BY-MEN-4-MEN, Luke Lowe has been reported as missing, prompting the police to open a criminal investigation. The 27-year-old activist was last seen at the King's Arms in Forest Hill, South East London, less than a mile from where his phone was recovered by a passer-by. Friends and family of Mr. Lowe have described him as a caring, decent and passionate man and have asked anyone with information to come forward. Caring and decent. This is a disaster. Caring and fucking decent. How can you focus on that right now?! How can you not?! Yeah, he's a “racist” and a “misogynistic”, yeah, we get it. What the fuck is "this"? I thought sunshine, dykes and foreign termites cleared "this" up! Yes, I get it. Do you? Eve, the police are involved right now. It's been three days and he still hasn't confessed so I think it's time to accept it's just not working. Bullshit, it's just not working yet. We need to take it up to the next level. The next level? And what's that? Like, the rack? Should I check eBay? See if there's like a buy-it-now option? Eve! Why limit ourselves? Eve, what are you doing? What are you doing? Remember we talked about hasty decisions. And we're live. Okay. Have you lost your fucking mind? Not even close. I'd back up. You're in shot there. You know the world's gone to shit when they describe a scumbag like this as caring and decent. You'll know this fucker as Luke Lowe. A coward who goes about anonymously terrorizing people just because they're a woman or they're brown or they don't conform to his model of acceptable sexual behavior. He makes them not want to speak out or go on. This is a message to all those who inexplicably care for this lowlife. He has no business being at liberty to live his life as normal in civil society. HE IS NOT FUCKING CIVIL! I want him to be locked up. And I won't stop until he is. I want him to confess to what he's done. And I want you to help me. I'm going to make him suffer just as he made others suffer. So I'm inviting you to submit your ideas on how to torture this fucker and I will perform it live just for you. Ladies and gentlemen, the power of justice is in your hands. What're you doing? Aiding and abetting a public execution, it would seem. A bit of an exaggeration. Do you have any concept of consequences? More than you know. Where's the fucking first aid box?! It's the cupboard under the sink. Is everything okay here? Yeah. Sure. It's fine. Why wouldn't it be? You can drop the sarcasm. It was on the dark web. Well, I need to change his bandage. Unless you like want your subject of torture to die of sepsis. Our subject. Oh, "our subject". There's those fucking air quotes again. Sorry. (MUFFLED WORDS) You ain't got the stomach for this, you know that. Good cop? Listen, I need a shit. At least let me have a shit. An asshole like you should be shitting yourself. Clever. Well, then, at least take this blindfold off. Please. Call it my… call my gift at the last supper. Thanks. I'm not racist, you know. I'm not sexist. Or a xenophobe. I'm not... I'm not anything she's trying to paint me out to be. I give a voice to the voiceless, that's all. You know, I don't know why yourself associate with her. You can shake your head all you want, you know I'm right. Muggings, stabbings, riots, all people like her. And people like her are fucking toxic and you're letting yourself get dragged down with her Am I starting to make sense to you now? Just take the fucking pills, asshole. Maybe one or two mind games won't hurt. They're sending in some pretty fucking awesome ideas. Do you wanna maybe choose the first one? Oh my god! Holy shit, that's dark. Ah, ew. Never underestimate people's appetite for sadism. Oh no, I like this one. This is very tasteful. Open it up. Evelyn! Oh my god. Evelyn, open the door! It's fine. She'll go away. She - she came back. Come on, I know you're in there. Open the door! Evelyn, open the door! Open this door at once. Come on, Evelyn, open the door. Open this door now. I'm going to call the police if you don't open this door. I've dialed the first nine. I'm dialing the second nine. She's gone. Come on, open this door now. She didn't see us. I know you're in there. Open the door. (WHISPERING) Hey. I want to see him. See who? Have I got idiot across my forehead? God, you haven't even changed your clothes. Do come inside. I can't believe you did this. This is so radical. You alright there? I'm fine. Okay, you're clearly, like, not fine. I am. I just need to breathe. Just take your time. Deep breaths. Okay, so I'm not fine. I did the whole Battle of Lewisham gay rights thing, but this - this is intense. I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you. Well, what have you got to say for yourself? Who the fuck is this monkey- loving liberal fucking dyke? Ok, that's enough. He's got a mouth on him, hasn't he? That's enough. You two girls are in a lot of trouble. So what do we do to sort it out? We? We? Last chance? You sure about this? It's more exciting than the WI. Easy. Thanks for all your wonderful suggestions. It was a tough choice but the first had to go to anon201 because of their personal connection to Luke Lowe And because it was so fucking good. Easy. Head. Eyes. Do you like it? New twists continue to emerge in the Luke Lowe abduction, which is being led by an unidentified woman. Despite her methods, a groundswell of men and women have come out in support of her campaign to Get Luke Lowe. Trolling is never acceptable but I think when you're someone like Luke Lowe who has been so horrible, justice needs to be served. I say they go full-blown ISIS on him. Yes! The fucking cunt deserves to die. Yes. To die! I can't fucking believe it. Seriously. Promise them blood and they'll show up to the Colosseum, it would seem. I wanna join you for this one. Me too. Sure. (MUFFLED CRIES) Let me know if you start to feel queasy. (REGURGITATES) (LAUGHTER) Give them an MBE. They're my heroes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Three women have now been identified as being involved with the abduction of Luke Lowe, calling themselves a women's movement against the abusive behavior of online trolls. In response, male activists have come out to counter the supporters. I don't know these women and I don't think they have a point. They don't have a point because you don't do that kind of thing. You're talking about social justice and then you go grab a man and take him, you lock him down. And then what, you beat him up? Who the fuck you think you are? We're gonna fuck you up. You didn't have much to say on the live stream today. No, you didn't. I was a little preoccupied. With? We have one day left. And we're in exactly the same position as we were at the start. He's close. Oh, he is, ah, I didn't realize. You're really gonna do this? Oh yeah, yeah. I'm really gonna do this. Look, he's an asshole. We know that. But there has to be something redeeming about him. Oh yeah, that's good. Really good. You agree with this? Yes, I do. (MUFFLED CRIES) (MUFFLED CRIES) What are you doing? Sssshhhh. Ew. Thanks. Shut up. Asshole. You forgot to say, shut up asshole. You know, I don't understand you. I saw a picture of your dad and your mum. And she's - She's Asian. She's not my mum. She's a fucking whore who stole my dad and gives him happy endings. Oh. That's all. A fucking whore. See I really wanna believe that there's more to you, asshole but when you say shit like that like sometimes I think you deserve everything you get. Sometimes? You know she's playing on your white guilt, right? Trying to drag you down with her. Listen, stop. Listen. I don't know you. I don't know your name. I don't know anything. But if you … if you help me I promise as far I'm concerned, you had nothing to do with it. Oh, come on. Where's Bonnie? Good question. Is everything okay? It's fucking fantastic. This is a problem. They could catch up with us tomorrow. Go anywhere nice? Just a walk to clear my head. And? And I think we should let him go. There's no fucking way. Like now. We still have time to get a confession. Ah, so this is still about Sadie? Are you insinuating that it's not? Eve, you're obsessed. Have you ever thought about why our friends disappear on you? Because they literally cannot deal with your constant rants about how society fucks you over every single time we go out. It defines you. I'm sorry I'm not afforded the position in society where I can forget who I am. Because I'm reminded of it every time I step out that fucking door. Or when I'm online. Or when I walk in to a job. So yes, it defines me because I don't have a fucking choice. You think that I don't have to deal with shit from assholes like him?! Like how I have to deal with it? You know I forgot it was you against the fucking world. We get it. Who's we? Ladies, we don't need this division amongst ourselves. It's us against the fucking world. Well, maybe you should remind her of that. Because she always jumps on because it's so cool. Oh okay. And it won't upset anyone or hurt my career. And does this color of lipstick look good on me? Sorry that I'm not a twenty-four hour, raging- Say it. Militant- Militant. Feminist. Yeah, I like to fuck men while it's still legal. What's wrong with that? There's nothing wrong with that. He's not going anywhere. He's gonna confess to what he did if it's the last thing I do. Oh what are you gonna do now? Like, knock him out his senses? Or maybe get like super iconic and like cut off an ear? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Get the fuck off me! Eve! Aren't you forgetting something? You look different to what I thought. Fuck! Where are you going? Where … Where are you going?! I say we dump him in Peckham in a white supremacist t-shirt and let nature take its course. Ever since I've known you, you've been on my arse about everything. Rubbish bins. You got my parents cited for overgrown hedges and now you're talking about dumping bodies. I have a dead husband two daughters who are absolute bitches and who never visit. And I have that great big house all to myself. Everybody needs -I don't know- a sense of purpose, I suppose. I didn't know. I suppose I've been a bit of a dick to you. A little bit. I guess I assumed we didn't have anything in common. Your gilet doesn't exactly scream bra burner. Does it need to? I'm so tired. Then get some rest. We'll sort all this out in the morning. Oh Sadie Sadie Sadie. You're my lady maybe maybe, my sweet… lady. What are you doing? Throwing in the towel it would seem. Nice shade. Lady Danger. Very fitting. Screw you. I wasn't being sarcastic. Oh then, like, unscrew you. What are you doing? I take it you didn't see the news this morning. This was my favorite. I wouldn't fuck that ugly, broad-nosed bitch if you paid me all the money in the world. Yeah. Actually, maybe I would if I had a banana as a strap-on. Look at them. We're going to come for you. We're going to take one of the studio wires, tie it to a tree … I said look at them. … and lynch you. Yeah. Luke? FUCKING LOOK AT THEM! What did she do to him? What did she do to him that would warrant this. Tell me. Tell me. I can only imagine what must've been going through her mind when she read this. She - she was our baby. She was our child. Do you have anything to say? I got nothing to say. (GASPS) No, you can't be so fucking cold. You must have something to say. (GASPS) (COUGHING) Thank you. I need to get my phone, make some calls. No one knows that it was you here, Dorothy. I'm not leaving you. I'll be back in ten. They're coming for us. I'm kinda looking forward to prison. My mum and dad are gonna kill me anyway. Probably. They don't allow make-up in prison, right? I don't know. Vapes? Depends on the flavor. You know on the plus side, think about what this'll do for my career. You know when I get out, I could get my own series. Yeah? Yeah. You know, we can be joint leads. Is there anywhere you've wanted to go? Hawaii. Yeah. Or like India. Central America. You know, somewhere I can like volunteer and put my like liberal guilt to good use. Not like that's gonna happen for a while. What about Cadiz in the South of Spain? My Uncle Tom lived there for a bit. Drink. Might be your last one in a while. I can't. I'm driving.
