(engine revving) (phone ringing) (moans) - Blast, who the hell can that be? Hang on. God, where is the bloody--(moans) Hello! - Oh! You don't have to shout at me, I'm not deaf. Is my daughter there, may I have a word with her, please? What's the matter, are you there, Bob? Bob, what's the matter with you? Aren't you up yet? You shouldn't be in bed doing nothing, you should be doing something productive. (Bob giggles) You're breathing very heavily, have you got a cold? Hope you're not giving it to Margaretta. May I speak to her, please? - Bloody marvelous, we've only been married 24 hours and already she wants an on-the-spot report of our sex life. Charming. Here, she wants you anyway. - Hello, Mummy. - Hello, darling, is everything all right? Bob sounded so strange. You know what it is, he smokes too much. You must try to get him to give it up. And tell him to take more exercise, he sounded terrible. - Oh, don't be silly, Mummy, Bob's as strong as a bull and he's getting plenty of exercise. - Good, I'm very glad to hear it, keep him at it, and don't let him slack. - Oh, he won't, not for awhile, anyway. What did you want, Mummy? - Well, are you coming? - Pardon? - Are you coming shopping, I want to buy you that wedding present. - Oh, well I, I don't (gasping), because I can't, um, mum. - Margaretta, for goodness sake, it sounds as though you've got it, too. What do you mean you can't? Are you telling me that he won't let you? Are you under him already? - Mmm, I mean, no, no, but, no, Mummy, yes, Mummy, I'm, please. - Oh, good, cause I've got some wonderful news for you. And Bob, which I'll tell you when you come around. - Oh no, come on, Mummy, tell me, what is it? - Tell her you'll call her back. - Well, you remember Aunt Emily who died last month? - Of course, I do. - She's left you her cottage. - Oh, that's wonderful. - Just think, you'll be able to live rent-free, no mortgage or anything. - Oh, it's too much. - Well, I hope you realize how lucky you are to be getting all that for nothing. No wonder you're sounding so excited. Still, so should I if I were getting it, too. - Oh, you'd love to be having it (gasps). - Well, I'll tell you what. - I'd better be going because I'm coming, I'm com, no, I'm sorry, I'll see you at the shop. Oh, thank you, Mother. - Mother? (folksy guitar music) (cows mooing) - Hi, have any luck? - Oh, well there's no bloody industry at all around here. All the decent jobs are miles away, but got no car for that. - Well, I've been thinking, I mean, look at what you've done to this cottage, you're so clever at doing that kind of thing. Why don't you go down to the village and offer some of those rich people your services? I'm sure they'll want some odd jobs doing. - Well how do you propose I go about that? Go around knocking on people's doors with a hammer and a bag of nails? - (laughs) Advertise. - Advertise as what? - As a handyman, silly. - Oh, yeah, I suppose I could, couldn't I? * Take me on for awhile * I'll soon be makin' you smile * What's with all of you people * Won't you give it a try * I'm sayin' that I've been around * People keep puttin' me down * But I've got nothing to lose, now * I'm still workin' the town * The ups and downs of a handyman * Livin' my life the best I can * Up and down all over town * I can make you smile I can make you frown * Oh, don't you know * There's just one way to go * Oh, don't you know * You know you want to go * Wouldn't you like to be me * Look me over and see * Look at all of your faces * Cryin' with jealousy * I can make you feel good * Or I can make you feel bad * But there ain't no good in tryin' * Giving back what I've had * The ups and downs of a handyman * Livin' my life the best I can * Up and down all over town * I can make you smile I can make you frown * Oh, don't you know * There's just one way to go * Oh, don't you know * You know you want to go * Wouldn't you like to be me * Look me over and see * Look at all of your faces * Cryin' with jealousy * I can make you feel good * I can make you feel bad * But there ain't no good in tryin' * Giving back what I've had * The ups and downs of a handyman * Livin' my life the best I can * Up and down all over town * I can make you smile I can make you frown * The ups and downs of a handyman * Livin' my life the best I can * Up and down all over town * I can make you smile I can make you frown * (bells ring) - Oh, good morning, love. - Morning. - Can you stick these in the windows for us, please? - Yes, sir. - [Bob] Cheers. - Oh, how interesting, a handyman.

(gasp) - Sorry, love. - Don't worry, quite enjoyed it. (light romantic music) - Good morning, madam. - Good morning, um I wonder if I could place this card in your window. - Why, certainly, madam. Thank you, oh, I see you're a teacher, then. A very attractive one, too, if I may say so. - Ooh (laughing), you may, thank you. - Oxford, Harrow, lot of experience, then. Are you a blue? - Well, I could be, if required I suppose, yeah. - (laughs) Yes, yes, well, that'll be 10 pence, please. - Oh, good, well, I hope it's worth the expense. I like my pupils well advanced. - Of course. Yes, I'll, excuse me, I'll just put this in the window for you. - Goodbye. - [Clerk] Goodbye, miss. - [Lady] Goodbye, again. - Goodbye, miss. - I've run out of cigarettes. (bell rings) (chatter and laughter) (bell rings) (bell rings) - Your cigar, thank you, sir. (bell rings) (buffoonish music) (clown horn honks) - Oh, that smells good. - Mmm, well, I've got to build you up. - I can't think why. - Oh, don't be silly, darling, something will turn up. - I'm sorry, love, just I'm feeling a bit fed up. I mean, we've been here a month now and nothing seems to be going right, nothing. - Oh, I know, darling, but look it's not every couple that's got a lovely cottage left them by an aunt.

That's why we sent for you. Drink? - Yeah. - Scotch? - Very nice, thank you. - Well, you see, every time she empties the bath, water somehow gurgles, splatters, and comes back through the overflow. We can go and have a look at it when she's ready. Here's your drink. - Thanks a lot. You're the girl from the news agent's aren't you? - Mmm, Daddy owns the shop. - Oh, I see. - Do you know he does amateur photography as well. - Mmm. - [Clerk] I pose for him. - Do you? - Well, not nude, I mean I couldn't do that, could I? - What? - Pose nude. - Oh, no, no, I suppose not. - Well, not with Daddy, anyway. I hope you're going to be good. - Sorry? - Well, I recommended you to Mrs. Wayne who's in the bath upstairs. - Oh, that's very kind of you. But um, how do you know I'll be any good? - Instinct, experience. - You've had a lot of handymen then have you? - I beg your pardon? - I mean, you have a lot of handymen advertising in your shop window? - No, you're the first. Well she must be ready now. Have you got your drink with you? - No, love, I left it down there. - Well, don't worry, I'll get you a stronger one later. Got the right tool with you? - Yeah, everything here. - Now, when we get to the bathroom, you pull it out? - What? - [Clerk] The plug, then let's see what happens. - Oh, good morning! Mrs. Wayne, I presume? (swinging music) (buffoonish music) Ah, Jesus. - Having trouble, sir? - It's these bikes, you see, officer. Well they're really difficult to steer until you've got up to speed and my pedal power seems to have left me. - Well you shouldn't have been in charge of the vehicle then in your state. - No, no, I'm all right, officer, really. It's just I've had a bath, I mean repaired a bath plug, tap! I mean, what happened you see, in there, when you empty the bath, the sink fills, when you empty the sink, it doesn't. - Oh, it doesn't? Obviously a case of a complete breakdown. - Well that's what I thought, see, well, when I went my plunger in, it didn't happen, because they grabbed me plunger, and well, sort of-- - I was referring to you sir, not the bath. - Uh, I've had it, officer. - It looks as though you have. I suggest you go home and do a complete plumbing job on yourself. - [Bob] What? - Dry yourself out, sir. So that's our new handyman (chortles) Heaven help us. - Maggie! Maggie? Now, where the hell are you? - [Maggie] I'm upstairs. - Where? - [Maggie] In the bath. - Oh, God. - What on Earth happened to you? - Yeah, well, the less said about that the better, eh? - Well, what happened to your clothes, they're soaking wet. - Come on, take them off and jump in the bath with me. - No, no, I can't, I must get down to Elgin farm. - Oh, come on, it's very sexy, what can be better than two people naked in a bath together? - Three? - [Maggie] What? - Three jobs to do today and I'm getting nowhere. - Oh, come on, I really feel in the mood, please? - No, I can't, I really can't. - Fred, it's half-day closing, I'm trying to get away, why do you always come in here when I'm closed? - Well, I can't be seen looking at these, these books for obscenity with the public present, now can I? - Now, that's what you always say, now come on Fred, you won't find any obscenity here. - [Fred] Mmm, pity. - [Arthur] Hmm? - I'm just doing my duty, Arthur, protecting the citizens from moral decline. Look at that brazen hussy. Oh, that's a flasher if I ever saw one. Disgraceful. Thank goodness we haven't anybody like her in the village. - Yes, yes, all right Fred, that's fine, now come on, come on, out, out, out. Fred, the book please unless you're keeping it for evidence. - Oh, I don't want this filth. - How would you like me? - (laughs) Well, I thought I'd like to take a nice art study. - Oh, all right. - I'll get ready. (manic comical music) There you are, Arthur, now you fix the lights. - The lights, yes, fix the lights, uh, oh yes. Ohh! (manic comical music) - Now what? How's that? - Perhaps another button? - Oh, Arthur, you are a naughty man. (both laugh) - And, uh, perhaps a little leg? - How's that? - Well, now, I wonder, do you think we, could we be a little more daring? - How do you mean? - Could you take your skirt off? - All right, but you turn your back first. - All right. - You may turn around now. Is this all right? - It's wonderful. - Well, when are you going to take a photo? - I've got to get everything right. There's an art in taking a good photograph. Oh, oh. - Well, I'm sure you know best. - That's right my dear. - Are you ready now? Well, what do you think? - Uh, I'm not sure. - Well, suppose I took my blouse off. - Yes, yes, I think that would work. - Think you're ready now? - I'll have a look. - Well, Arthur? - I'm still not happy. - Well, what do you think I should do? - What do you think? - Well, perhaps I should take everything off. - That would help, yes, yes, that would be it. - All right. (manic comical music) - That's it, that's it. I'm ready, I'm ready! - Hang on, Arthur. You need this to flash with. (flash blows up) (cows mooing) - Hello. Are you looking for something? - Uh, yeah, Elgin farm, love? I've been chasin' around all over the place, but there are no signposts or anything. - Well, I think you've, uh, found what you're looking for, haven't you? Or haven't you? - I Beg your pardon? - Elgin Farm, that's what you're looking for, isn't it? - Uh, yeah, that's right, I'm a bit late already. - Hmm, you must be the new handyman. - That's right, yeah. - I bet Mummy can't wait to meet you. - Come on, I'll show you. - No, no, hang on there. Don't you think you'd better get dressed first? - What's the matter, don't you like me the way I am? - Oh, yeah, yeah, nice. But, uh, well, uh, it's just I don't think you're mother would like me turning up with you dressed like that, do you? - Mmm, maybe you're right, she is a bit of an old dragon. - Hang on, don't I need my tools? - Your tools, I suppose you can't do anything without them, can you? - Oh. - Right, here you are, then, this is the barn that mummy wants cleaned out. - Oh, fine, I'll get started then. Oh, I see, have you got anything I can shift all this hay with? - Of course, the pitchfork. - Oh, right. - Have you always been a handyman then? - Oh, no, love, uh, I was in the navy for a bit, actually. - In the navy, gosh, a sailor. I'm going to London soon to become a dancer. I'm going to have my own act, and will drive men wild and meet film stars and beautiful people. - Oh, very nice for ya. - You don't believe me, do you? Well I'll show you that I can. * So you want to be a rich girl * Livin' like a lady bird * With riches like the Queen of Sheba * Or maybe the Queen of the Nile * There's a long hard way to go now * So you'd better start thinkin' fast * Oh, oh * Oh, oh - Sorry Fred. Oh, you're looking worried, too, is there something wrong? - There may be, on the other hand, there may not be. - Well, I'm just on my way to try and stop it. There's plenty of it about, you know. - It's breaking out everywhere. Any stopping to be done, I'll stop it. - Yeah, but you know what starts it off. - Can't put my finger on it, Charlie, but I don't trust him. - I can't think why, he's never let me down before. And all the cows really enjoy him. - Well, he's proving himself some handyman. - Perhaps we should give him a really strong injection. I do know that we must keep him warm and he must be well-attended to. - He's well-attended to, I just saw Polly drag him to the barn. - Oh, well, if she looks after him well, I don't mind. Anyway, I can't just hang around here all day, I've got some seeds to sow. - Well, as long as you're the only one with that in mind. - So long, Fred. - Just a minute, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie! Oh! - Oh, sorry, Fred. Oh, by the way, will you tell the missus, if he's no good this afternoon I'll have him put down and I'll get her a new shorthorn tomorrow. So long. (Fred groans) - It's no use pretending to work, I know I'm turning you on. * Oh but listen to what I'm sayin' * And don't you let yourself go down * Oh, oh * Oh, oh now * You say you want to be Queen of the screen * And go pretty far * And drive a big car - Look, look, I'm sorry, you mustn't think this is anything to do with me. I mean, it was her and I, I mean, no, no, not me. That is, she was and I wasn't, see? (buffoonish music) (gasps in pain) (pounding on door) - I'm sorry about that, is Mrs. Elgin around? - No, nor Polly, they're in the barn helping the handyman. - I thought he was supposed to be helping them. I think I'll go and investigate. (manic music) (women giggling) (Fred groans) (lumber crashing) - Get out of the way, I can't stop! Oh, blimey, officer, I'm sorry, honest? Here, up you get. Brush your jacket down there - Get off, maniac. I'll have you, dangerous driving, bad brakes, faulty steering, hah, and no seat belts. - [Bob] But, officer-- - You should be locked up. Handyman, I've never seen you do anything handy yet. I must warn you that anything you say further-- - Oh no, Officer, you've got it all wrong. - Well, that's interesting. - Uh, yes, see, we thought we heard a tramp in the barn, we searched for him, oh, so sorry about this dress. - Oh, reveal all, I mean, tell me everything. - Oh, well, then we thought we heard a noise outside, and this brave man came out to investigate. - Brave man? - Officer, would you be a gentleman and lend me your jacket, and escort me back to the farmhouse? - [Fred] Of course, Madam. - I'm getting rather cold. - [Fred] We must cover your exposed br, eh, your bare, you're bristol, uh, let's put my coat around you, let's get you home. (sighs) (yawns) - How was it, love? - Oh, pretty rough. - Oh, you're not used to it, that's your trouble. Still, never mind, I've brought you some nice chops. Why don't we have an early night? You eat that, gotta keep your strength up, and I'll just go up and have a bath. Do you like it, darling? Darling? Darling? (sighs) Darling. - Hello everybody - [Voiceover] Hello. - Oh, this is nice. - Cocktail or your usual? - Oh the usual, thank you. Very relaxing, that's what I need, rather a lot of relaxation at the moment. Life's very frustrating. Seem keeping fine though, thank you. Mmm, I see you have a new maid. - Yes, the squire found her actually. She was up for some minor offense or other. So he sentenced her to a good spanking, put her in my custody for good behavior, and said he never wanted to see her up before him again. She's given pretty good service ever since. - By the way, I hear you, uh, exhausted our new handyman the other day, Mary. - Not me, it's when he went over to the farm when the trouble started, wasn't it, Jenny? - Oh, I don't know about that. But I hear you've booked him now, Prudence. - Anyone for another drink? (phone ringing) - [Bob] Oh, let it ring. - [Maggie] Oh, we can't, darling. Might be another job, can't let people down. Hello? - [Voiceover] Is that the handyman? Could he call 'round this morning, because I've got some odd jobs that I'd like him to do? - OK, I'll tell him, he'll be up as soon as he can. - [Voiceover] Thank you. - [Maggie] Bye-bye. - Who's that, hmm? - It was the squire's wife, she wants you to do a job. I'll go make you some breakfast. - Well, can't be much harm in a squire's wife. I hope. - Bop, bop, bop, mmm, mmm, mmm. So, what have you got planned today, my dear? - Oh, I've got the handyman coming 'round to have a look and do a few jobs. - Well, don't let him keep you gossiping all day long. You know what old Gasper's like. - Of course not, my dear. - Yes, well, thank you, my dear, oh, so sorry, my dear. I'm always doing that. Well, must go do a bit more hunting, thank you so much my dear. - [Prudence] Good luck. - Bye (chuckles). Oh. (chuckles and hums) (bouncy music) (horses neigh) (horn blaring) (wheels squeaking) (humming) (door bell rings) - Oh, good morning, Mrs. Bullsworthy? - Yes, that's right, do come in. - Oh, thanks very much. This way is it? - Go straight through. (thundering hooves and neighing horses) (dogs barking) You're new around here aren't you? - Yeah, that's right, we've just moved in to that little cottage down past the farm. - Oh, I know, my husband rides past your place. - Oh, really? - He says your wife could do with a good spanking. - What? - Oh yes, my husband loves spanking girls' bottoms. - Does he? - [Prudence] Especially when he's out hunting. - [Bob] What, for girls' bottoms? - No, foxes. - [Bob] Oh. - Mind you, he caught one on the last hunt hiding there right in the bushes. - What, a fox? - No, a girl, silly. - Oh, I see. - Well didn't she complain? - Yes, she doesn't approve of blood sports at all. - No, no, I mean about the spanking. - Oh, no, goes on the hunt every week now, hides and waits for him to find her. He's even got the dogs trained. - Well, don't you complain? - Only when he stops. - [Bob] I see, you mean, he has a go at you as well? - Course he does, look I'll show you. - [Bob] Oh, very nasty. - Would you like a drink by the way? - Yeah, yeah, why not. - Well, come with me. - You know, I'm gonna have trouble with that new fellow who moved into Mrs. Willit's cottage. Can't even ride a bike properly. A three-wheeled one at that. Bloody dangerous he is. - Oh, what makes you say that, dear? - He practically ran me down this morning. Bashed into a barn and ripped the clothes off poor Mrs. Elgin. - He did what? - And he knocked on the squire's door, bothering the squire's wife before she even had time to get dressed. - Oh, don't be silly, dear, I'm sure he wasn't bothering her. Most likely, she has something she wants doing. - Well, he wants should be doing something with that bike. A lethal weapon, that's what it is. He'll run into some window with that one day, that's for sure. Parks it anywhere, he does. Next time I catch him I'll slap a ticket on it. Obstructing an entrance, no loading or unloading, I'll get him. - Don't be silly, dear, I'm sure she's working him. Very hard. (laughing) - Hello? Yes, OK, I'll tell him. Bye. (phone rings) Hello? Uh, yes, OK. (phone rings) Hello? Here's some more calls for you, darling. (phone ringing) Hello, who? OK, fine, all right. Bye. (singing opera) (knock on door) - Come in, it's open. * Maisie, Maisie dear * When you're very near * All my feelings get confused * Maisie can't you see * What you do to me * I can't get away from you * Such a smile * What a smile * Oh it turns me on * Such a girl * What a girl * The life is just a great big bowl of fun * Maisie, you're too much * Oh no, don't you touch - Bloody hell, round the bloody bend. - (gasps) Thank goodness! You must be the handyman, I need you desperately. - You gotta be joking. - I'm not, I've needed you since last night. - Last night? - Yeah, that's when it happened. Oh God, I hope he's all right. - What happened, all right? You're mad, you're all mad. - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? Well that's rich, that is. Well what's wrong with you? What's wrong with all of you? You're maniacs, the lot of you, but you, blimey, you're not even subtle about it. - About what, what are you talkin' about? - The women around here, that's what. - I don't understand you. - Oh no? Then, why'd you ask me up here, then? - Oh, I see, oh look, let's start all over again, shall we? You are the new handyman, aren't you? - Yeah. - Good, well, can you mend the bed for me? - Oh. I'm sorry, I really am, honest. - Oh, it's all right, forget it. Mind you, you had me worried for a minute. - (laughs) Well that makes two of us, love. - What's the problem? - No, no, my mistake, I was out of order, as you say, forget it, eh? - I think you need a stiff drink, don't you? - Well, I wouldn't say no to a large scotch. - One large scotch coming up. - Smashing. Blimey, this has had a right old hammering. New legs on this side for starters. - Glasses up. - Oh, cheers (shouts). (thundering crash) - It's just not your day, is it? (buffoonish music) - I'm in uniform, dear. Steady, cheerio, dear. (folksy music) (horn honks) - Morning, mum. - Half a gallon of your best, please. - Half a gallon, won't get very far on that. - Wanna bet? (folksy music) - Oh, morning. - Oh, how lucky. You're the new handyman? - Yeah. - My car seems to have broken down. - Well, I'm not very well up on cars. - Please look at it for me, I'm sure you may be able to help. - Oh, well, to tell you the truth, love, motors really aren't in my line. - I'm sure cars are just like women. They need a man's touch to get them going - Oh, right. Uh, is this the bonnet lever, love? - No, see, it's the gear lever. It opens there. - Outstanding. - Perhaps they require some sort of adjustment. - Yeah, yeah, perhaps. Uh, listen, why don't I shoot off down to the local garage, maybe they can send someone up, eh? - No, no, don't do that, I'm sure we'll be able to manage something between us. Have a look underneath. - Look, honest, you've got the wrong man, I really don't know what I'm doing. - Never mind, have a go, just for me, please. - All right. (buffoonish music) Eh, looks all right to me. Bit dirty, maybe. But then, I don't know what I'm looking for anyway, and if I did, I wouldn't know what to do if I found it. - What, what did you say? You found something? - I said, oh blimey, it's a bit dark down here, I can't see much. - Oh, excuse me. - Fan belt. - What? - Fan belt, battery, let's check battery. - There you are, you see, you are clever. - Where is it? - In the back. - Maybe you're a bit flat. - I hope not, I have it regularly serviced and a good going over once a month. - Yeah, well, you certainly topped up all right. What about the leads, where are the leads? - There they are. (both grunt) What took you so long? (laughs) (buffoonish music) (energetic music) Mmm, I feel as though I'm floating on air. Your hands are nice and soft, I bet you use hand cream. - No, it's the grease from the car. - What, stop it, stop it. - I don't understand, it was you-- - Not you, the car. Do something, steer it. (buffoonish music) Steer it. - I can't, the steering wheel's the other end. - Oh God, do something. - Hang on, I'll turn on the hand brake. Shit, where is it? - See on the side, useless, you call yourself a mechanic, pull it, break. - What, listen now, I told you that I didn't know anything about--. - [Woman] Break. No, the other side. Break. - I can't. - That's the gear lever. - What's that? Huh, ho. (sighs) What a mess. - Oh no. - [Bob] Oh, yeah. - No. - [Bob] Yeah. - No, it's the law. - [Bob] What law? - The police, you fool. - Oh, morning Officer. We seem to have had a bit of an accident. - I'm not surprised, the position you're in. Would you care to leave the car before you have another? And the lady, too. Maniac, bloody dangerous. You should be locked up. And you will be once I'm finished with you. For years, I hope. Driving without due care and attention, and exceeding the speed limit in reverse. - But Officer, I can explain. - Damaging police property, and now, threatening an officer with an offensive weapon. - Come off it, this is a gear lever, it came off in me hand. - Oh, faulty gear lever. Has this car been M-O-T'd sir? - Well, I don't know, this lady was having trouble getting started-- - I saw how you got her started. - Now, listen, Constable, I've had enough. - I can see that, madam. - Now look here, we were in the car-- - Committing an obscene act in a public place. Attempting to drive a car from the rear seat. Right, sir, right, madam? I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence against you. Now, sir, madam, have you anything to say? - Yes, your fly's open. - My fly's open. (horn honking) (church bells ringing) - Well, hello, what kept you? - Sorry, madam, I've um, just had a breakdown. - Oh, I'm sorry, I hope it wasn't anything too serious. I've got a lot for you to do. - Oh no, I'm fine. - Good, well, this is going to be a surprise. My husband doesn't know anything about this. - Really? - Mmm, it's just a secret between you and me. - I see. - Mmm, well, better come in then. - Right. Oh. - Well, here it is. - What exactly do you want me to do then? - I want you to put it up. - You what? - The paint, I want you to paint the ceiling. - Oh, I see. All right then, I'd better start then. - I usually put it on the window sill. - I beg your pardon? - [Woman] The plank. Move the ladder closer and put the other end on the window sill. - Oh, if you say so. - Well, it's the way my husband does it, but he can't put anything up. So, uh, I needed an expert. Someone who knows what he's doing. - Very sensible. Well, as my old man used to say, if a job's worth doin'. - Yes? - It's worth doing well, right? - I quite agree. - The wife thinks I'm quite good at it, anyway. - Oh well, she should know. - Quite true, you should have seen us over at our place. We had to strip off everything before we could start. - Isn't that usual? - Yeah, but I had a terrible job getting it up. - Oh, surely not, a big man like you? - Well the wife helped of course. - She sounds as if she knows what she's doing. - What do you fancy then? - What do you suggest? - Uh, psychedelic? - Oh, yes, that sounds interesting. - Well, I think I got enough here to do it with. - Oh, I'm sure you have. - Could you find something I can stir the paint with? - Oh, yes, I can see something. - Where? - Do you want me to get it for you? - Yeah, if you wouldn't mind, and then I can get the paint up the ladder, OK? - Well, I hope it'll be long enough. - What's that? - The thing, to stir the paint with. - Oh, don't worry about that I'll find something. - Oh, no, no, give me time, I'm still looking. - You found it yet, then? - Any minute now. Oh, I think I found it. - No! Oh, God, I'm so sorry about that. (mumbles) This just isn't my day today, I'm really sorry, honest. - I suppose now you'll drag me naked across the ceiling. (cows mooing) (knocks on door) - Ah, hello, Mr. Wessex. - Call me Gasper, most other folks do. - Well, we haven't been here long. - I know that. - Well Gasper, you see, it's like this, my husband he's gone into the handyman business, and to be quite frank with you, it seems to be far more than he can handle. - I've been handyman here, man and boy, never been more than I can manage. - I don't know about that, but Bob, he comes home exhausted every night. - Well what do you want me to do, ma'am? - Well, I thought perhaps you could come to some sort of arrangement, you know, split the jobs. - All right, it suits me, Missy. - I'll just go and get a list of his calls. - Well these foreign buggers, I don't understand how they do it. I've been handyman in this village, man and boy, never tired me out. - Here we are Gasper. And when you've finished those I'll have plenty more for you. - All right, ma'am, I'll get on with these and come back for more later. (knocks on door) - What on Earth do you want? - You sent for an odd job man. - Yes, but you're not, well. - I'm the odd job man. - Who sent you? - The gaffer's wife, ma'am. - Tell her I cancelled the call. - Um, come to do the odd job, ma'am. - What did you say? - Well it says here that you have a odd job you want doing. - Oh, oh, go and chop the weeds. (bells chime) - Hello, darling. - Mmm, I'm so tired. - Oh, that's all right, darling, I've solved our worries. - Hmm? - I've got you some help, there's a sweet old man called Gasper. He's been the handyman in the village here for years. Anyway, I've done a deal with him, and I've given him some of your calls. Aren't I a clever girl? - You've done what? - I've given him some of your calls. I did do right, didn't I? - (laughs) Well, I don't know, this should prove very interesting. - And then that old fool Gasper turned up. - Yes, and he even turned up to wash my car. - Yes, I've had the same thing as well. - When I employ a young man for some hard work, I expect a young man to turn up. - We all know what hard work you wanted doing. - There's no need to come that butter wouldn't melt in my little mouth, we all know your mouth is the only little thing about you. - Oh, let's forget it shall we, he's made fools of all of us. And he's taken our money under false pretenses. - Yes, very true. - What's this about, false pretenses? - It's the new handyman. - Well, what's he been up to? No good, that's a certainty. - Well it's just that some of us employed him to do odd jobs and instead he's sent old Gasper along. And when he's come, he hasn't done much. In fact, he's done nothing. - Come to think about it, I gave him an odd job to do the other day and he made a complete botch of it. - We'll have to do something with this handyman fellow. A word in your ear, Squire. - Certainly, Knowles, come into the study, you know the way. Follow me, you see what bothers me is I've (fades out) - Do you think that was wise, dear? - Well, attack is the best method of defense. - There we are, love, one cafe con latte. Any calls this morning? - None so far (yawns). - Have you started breakfast yet? - No. - Let's skip it, shall we? (buffoonish music) (knocks on door) (knocks on door) - Ah. What's in here? (muttering) (knocks on glass) - Mister Plod. Yes, Officer, can I help you? - I doubt it, sir. I've had several nasty complaints about you. - What? - (chuckles) Money under false pretenses. Work unfinished, etc., .etc. - Well that's just not true. - Well, that's as may be, the squire would like to see you, at the hall. Tonight, 8:00. - What for? - You'll see, be at the police station, 7:30. And. Don't be late. - Darling, I'm up here. - I've gotta go out. - Oh, hell. (din of patrons) - It's a bit early for that, isn't it? - No, I need it. Do you fancy another round? (mumbles) - What's the trouble, more women problems? - Aye, you could say that. Only now the local knobs are in it. - No, caught on the job? - Not on the job is more to the point. - How do you mean? - Well, it doesn't matter. - Tell her. - Now come on, sometimes it helps to tell someone, you know. - Bitches. - What've they done to you? - Well, I got so busy, my wife thought I needed some help. - She, what? - Employed this old geezer to gimme a hand. (laughs) Yeah, it's all right for you to laugh. Now I'm being done for false, false pretenses. - Oh no, you poor thing. What, are they ganging up on your or something? - And there's nothing I can do about it. - Think you've had enough, why don't you come back with me and have a coffee? - Fat lot of good that would do. - You'd be surprised. Come on then, come back with me. Oops. There we are. Feeling better, love? - No. - Drink the coffee, it helps. Yeah, for a hangover, perhaps, but not me. - That's where I come in, listen. While you were playing about with all the wives, did you ever wonder what the husbands were up to? - Oh, uh, I don't know. - Take that old man Wayne for instance. (oohs and ahhs) (giggling) And then, there's that copper. (laughing and whooing) And as to the squire, hoo. (maniacal laughter) And then there's the butcher. Oh, you wouldn't believe what they get up to. (yelps and laughter) - What a town. It's unbelievable. Oh, but how's this gonna help me? - Don't worry, I'll think of something. - You didn't realize the squire was the local magistrate. I'll get promoted for this. Ah, ah. Now you, stand there and don't you move. I've got you now, you know. (laughing maniacally) - Squire, listen, I'm not gonna be able to go on keeping you happy like this if I run the local pub as well. Why don't they give the job to that nice young couple that's just moved here? He's already doing odd jobs about the place, you know? - The handyman, yes, that'll keep him occupied (laughs). - We don't make many mistakes. (knocks on door) - Who's that? - Don't worry, my dear, it's only Knowles (laughs). - This is it. (knocks on door) - Oh, I suppose I'd, I'd better deal with it, dear. - Right. - [Squire] Excuse me. - Thank you, Squire. - Yeah. (giggling) Thank you my dear. Knowles. - The squire would like to see you, sir. This way. (bells chiming) - So, asleep are ya? What a pity, have to keep the news til tomorrow. Still, perhaps it's just as well. Don't want to excite you too much. - What news? - What, love? - I said, what news. - Oh, never mind, love, you go to sleep. It'll keep til morning. - What news? - Careful, careful. Can't have the new landlord of the local with scratches all over his face, can we? - What did you say? - They offered me the job, down at the boozer. I accepted. - Darling! (folksy music) (rooster crowing) - Well, I can't understand it, one minute they're all against him, and the next minute, they make him manager of the local. - At least there's no unpleasantness. - Let's stop bitching, let's organize ourselves from now on. - Yes, well that means we're back to where we started. - I think I know what we can do. If I were to order some drinks. - What's she going to do? - Hey, darling, things are really looking up, here's our first order. - Oh, great, who's it for? - The squire. - The squire? - Mmm, he's a jolly good customer. - OK, still, I hope he won't wanna spank me. - You what? - Oh, nothing, nothing. - Oh, anyway, she wants it out first thing this afternoon. - She? - Mmm, the squire's wife, I think it's a surprise. - Yeah, well, I hope you're right. Well, I'll go and fix it up, eh? (folksy music) * Who do you think is coming round * And taking me down to the fair * Margaretta now she's better * Come on round let down your hair * Come today and not tomorrow * Come tomorrow I'll be gone * But you know just how you look * You're looking good * There's nothing wrong * Well there's magic in the air * Let's go to the fair * There's magic in the air, oh yeah * And all our friends are there * Quickly now we've got to go * To see a show I'll show you where * Take my hand and watch your step * There's muddy water over there * We'll be there in just awhile * So come on now, let's have some fun * - Ah, the drinks. We're in the garden by the swimming pool. - Right, I'll bring it over. * There's magic in the air - Come this way, follow me please. * There's magic in the air, oh yeah * And all our love we'll share * Magic in the air * Magic in the air * Magic in the air * Magic in the air - You didn't think you could lose us that easily. We didn't want you to lose your liscense. - Run girls, get him! (shouting) (manic music) (shouting and laughing) - Love-40 - You must be joking. (din of pub patrons) - Here we are sir, that's 12 p. - [Voiceover] Thank you, my dear. - Do you want another drink, Mummy? - I never thought to see a daughter of mine end up as a bar maid. And fancy being left that lovely cottage and expecting me to give it all up. Where is Bob? It's not fair leaving you to do everything for yourself. I suppose he's running around somewhere. - At this very minute he's up delivering at the squire's house. - Well, he might have waited to see me before he went off. - Oh Mom, he's had such a lot on his hands, lately. He'll probably come rushing in here at any moment. - Well, I want to go, I don't feel happy in this place. I hope Bob remembers that it's me and Aunt Emily he has to thank for his situation, it'd be nice to hear him say so. (glass shatters) (gasps of shock) I don't believe. - What the hell have you been up to? - You know when I went up to deliver the booze to Squire, I went round the swimming pool, and what's she doing here? - For God's sake, cover yourself. (phone ringing) - Well, I suppose I'd better answer it. Nobody else around here seems to bother. Hello? It's the news agent's daughter. She wants to know if you want to put it in for another week. - No, and you can tell her I'm never gonna put it in ever again either. * Take me on for awhile * I'll soon be making you smile * What's with all of you people * Why don't you give it a try * I'm sayin' that I've been around * People keep puttin' me down * But I've got nothin' to lose now * I'm still working the town * The ups and downs of a handyman * Livin' my life the best I can * Up and down all over town * I can make you smile I can make you frown * The ups and downs of a handyman * Livin' my life the best I can * Up and down all over town * I can make you smile I can make you frown *
