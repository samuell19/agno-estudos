If the current MLA passed away, the chief minister should be here to pay his respects. Instead, why is the home minister coming here? Is the chief minister busy or does he not need us anymore? Nothing of that sort, Rajappa. There as an urgent meeting and so he had to stay back. The death of your father has left you, your family, the party and all of us with an irreplaceabl Don’t worry about it. The party will support you. Whether you want to do some business or take up government contracts, it’s your wish. If you want something, ask for it. When are the by-elections? The untimely death of MLA Nagappa of our party will bring on by-elections. Nagappa’s son Rajappa desires to contest those elections as a candidate of our party. If we give candidatures to the sons who lost their fathers and the widows who lost their husband when will those party workers who worked hard for the party be given an opportunity to become le The people there are not mourning the loss of Nagappa. Everyone is celebrating the death. Yes, sir. Given the atrocities committed by Rajappa because of political backing of his father, we will most definitely not get even a single vote in our favour. Though our party member Mr. Raghavaiah from Macharla stayed away from our party, he is a leader who has close ties with the people there. If he were to be given the candidature, we will surely win that seat and even the party will ris Please give him your endorsement for candidature. This CM is a piece of work. If it was good news, he would deliver it himself. If it was bad news, he would order us to be its bearers. Rajappa, the party has met to decide on who to endorse as their candidate for the upcoming by el I insisted that you be given the candidature. But... the party decided that this time, Raghavaiah be given the candidature. Minister, after my father passed away, did you guys change the rules within the ruling party? You said what you had to say. I heard it. I will do what is required of me. Watch me. Long live Raghavaiah’s leadership! [Sloganeering] We thank you all for coming out after all these days and showing us your support. Even when I didn’t have any authority, I was always with you. I will always be with you for sure. But given the political scenario of today... you don’t need a tortoise like me. You need some young and relentless helmsman. That is the reason why... I recommend my son Suryam Babu in my stead. Did you think that after my father’s death, his kingdom would be yours? Did you not think that this Rajappa exists or did you forget about it? If you are given a ticket, you should go to the theatre and watch the movie. But why would you contest the elections? All the people who oppose me now... including you, need to know what Rajappa is. The sun that you desperately wished would shine his light on you, died even before the sunrise. From now on, Macharla will no longer have elections. Polling will no longer take place. Unanimous! Hey, no. Please. Sidhu first, then your turn Hey, baby. No one smeared you yet? Shall I do it? -Who are you? These days, introductions don’t matter. As long as you look untainted, I will smear you. These days women look much more beautiful in wet clothes rather than in skimpy outfits. Nidhi, come here. Wow! Just like her name, her body looks like a jewel. I want to rob it. You are crossing your limits. Siddhu! Who is he? Your bodyguard? No, her boyfriend. A hero, huh? It’s going to be a little bland if you call for him. But if I do it, it will be a lot of fun. Siddhu? Siddhu, dear? Usually, when you mess with me, I deal with you my way. But if you mess with women,... This...this is how it looks. You are going overboard. Yes, I am. I have a lot of GB. GB isn’t what you think it is. Responsibility for girls. Responsibility. It’s at another level. He thinks he is a hero. It would be better if we make up our minds to be the villains here. Heroes don’t always end up as the winners. At times, the villains win too. Bro...bro, please let us go. I get it. No matter what happens, at the end of the day, only the hero wins. Don’t touch means no touching. That’s good. But what to do if you refuse when there is an offer to touch? You are my friend. I beg you. Let’s go. Come on. Chill down...chill down... chill down... Slow down the life that’s cruising at jet speed. Listen up, listen up...listen up, buddies. Listen to the voices inside the heart. Making mistakes when you are young is not really making mistakes. Why carry that heavy burden when it’s not time yet? Tripping...tripping...tripping on the floor. Come on, fall in love a little. Forget everything else. Let’s live through all the ages. Keep watching the drama You are my courage Tell me, shall we freeze time? The girl looks naughty. It’s a rave party. She is asking me if she can cross the line. Just keep dancing at random. I love this freedom Hello, Miss. Madam Let’s just stop here. Making mistakes when you are young is not really making mistakes. Why carry that heavy burden when it’s not time yet? Tripping...Tripping...Tripping... On the floor. Who fixed this title? Sorry, sir. Well, where is the caption? Take a look now, sir. The father of ego. It’s new. I like you. I am coming. Oh, it’s you? You are already here. Come. Why do you look like you entered the neighbour’s house? What’s with that weird reaction? It’s our house, isn’t it? Come in. Goodness! Looks like his ego is hurt. Wow! You are really great. Even on the day of Holi, you look so spotless and shiny like the people in the ads of Nirma washing powder. You are super! How did you manage to do this? How? I will bite you. Doesn’t matter if it’s a collector or even some colour, they must bow down to my ego. Didn’t I tell you that... I would return without a single drop of colour falling on me? Single drop. Happy Holi. Thank goodness. All of it fell down... On him... You jerk! Father! Father! If anyone hits, they call out for their mother. How come you are calling out for your father? Who is your father? Who the hell is your father? Who? Who? Who the hell is he? It’s you! This is our Bunty. So, what if he is Bunty or a bell?! Stupid faced woman! Today I must find out who his mother is! Tell me! Stop it. Husband, he is really our son. Here, see this. ‘Father is my God.’ Where is your Tatto? -Here. ‘My husband is my God’. Sorry. Why do you stink?! Brother Siddhu broke an egg in my underwear, father. Couldn’t you have sat on the stove? It would have turned into an omelette! These days Siddhu has turned even more crazy. He must have cracked an egg on you. But I will crack his ego. -Please, don’t. You come with me! Where are you coming? You come with me! -Listen to me... Hi! Your legs might break off. Is this the way you raise your son? What are you talking about? I am in no way related to him. How can this fatty be my son? I am not talking about my son. I am talking about that jerk! Take into account my son’s size and your son’s age. Siddhu broke an egg in my son’s underwear! My son? This entire discussion is about my son. Outside the house, he roams around with girls. And at home, he kills time with little kids... Eat up, dear. This one here.... as soon as it’s morning, he lounges around the house! If your son crosses the limits, I will lose my control. Tell him! I will deal with him. Hi, aunty -Hi, dear. Looks like the woman are flocking around him inside the house. There is neither decency or cultured behaviour. Should you really be the one talking about manners and decency? Yes, I am telling you. Why don’t you listen? You wouldn’t listen at all. Hey, man. What’s up? Bye Siddhu. Bye, aunty. -Bye. Just because the government banned those websites, this man started to get indecent right at hom Forget about being proud of him. Get them both married! Green T-Shirt and black pant. You cannot become a respectable elder by just the way you dress. It should be in your manners. Let’s go! If you stay here any longer, you must get addicted to watching adult stuff. Let’s go! Does this old man need a colourful T-shirt? If I see him ever again, I will murder him. Did you see that, Siddhu? Even that jerk is teaching us some lessons! What exactly is your problem in marrying that girl? She is okay with it, her family and even we are okay with it. But what is your problem? Father, she is my childhood friend. I have no such feelings towards her. She is my best friend. That’s all. What’s going on with him? He isn’t paying attention to the woman right beside him and goes about talking crazy nonsense. Why can’t you talk to him? Why would he do something that the both of us ask him to? He does what he feels is best. I am already here. Why didn’t you come? I'll call you later Thank you Brother. -Here, take it. Book... Okay. Hello? Excuse me. Bapu’s painting. Your book. Oh? Sorry. Thank you. Do you really like me that much? What do you mean? Then, why is my picture... Oh, this? I like drawing things that I like. Doesn’t that mean you like me? Hello? You are reading way too much meaning into this. I just drew it on a whim. I don’t like you like that. Oh? If you didn’t like me, why did you hug me? Tell me. Hug? What do you mean I hugged you? Don’t be smart. I am always smart. You drew me in a book. But I printed your picture here...right here. You have disturbed me. What’s going on? Why are you talking without making any sense? As soon as I looked at you, the entire world came to a standstill. And all my senses stopped working. I like you a lot. I am fixated on you. You will be my life partner. Why don’t you agree to it as well? This is too much. Let’s do this. If you like me, leave from here quietly. If you don’t like me, give me your address before you leave. Since you are leaving, that means you do like me. No matter where you live in Vizag, I will find you. Within a span of two days, I will be in front of you. I will catch you. Wait for me. Bye. Bunty, today, the ocean looks quite different. Yes, brother. You seem different too. Why do you say that? Unusually, you brought me out and bought me to subway and are feeding me. What’s going on? A miraculous thing happened to me. What is it? Nidhi left you? No. There is a new person in my life now. Is that why your face seems to glow? Yes. The girl of my dreams appeared in front of me. Where? Where is she? She is here But I don’t know where she is. We need to search for her and find her out. Brother, you know of alleys even the Google doesn’t know about. If you are determined, it’s an easy job. Go ahead and find out. Such a golden boy you are! Come, cheers! Cheers! Wherever you are, I am going to find you. Within two days, I will appear in front of you. My egoistic brother-in-law! Such bad karma! Brother-in-law.. what brings you by like this? Like this? Fine, give me some women’s clothes. I’ll wear them and come to meet you. Disgusting! Of course, disgusting! As if I would really wear something like that. Move! Well, brother-in-law, I meant... -Hold on You came to my city and instead of staying with me, you choose to stay here. Will my ego be able to take it? Brother-in-law, I am quite safe here. Really? If you roam around the beaches of Vizag with that beautiful face of yours, will the young men of Vizag let you be in peace? Looks like someone is deeply thinking of you. Have some water, my son. It must be the beauty that I saw on the beach. I know. Self-respect. If your self-respect weighs in kilos, my ego measures in quintals. Pack your bags. Please, brother-in-law. Please, brother-in-law. Select a font for the tattoo that says “My brother-in-law is my God” and start immediately. Who’s the tattoo for? Who else? It’s for you. At least with that tattoo, people will stay away from you. Forget about the tattoo, brother-in-law. Let’s just go home. What happened to your self-respect now? Pack your bags! You are a merely a door of a car. How dare you expect me to close you with my hands?! Damn it! I was going in search of that girl. Instead, I ran into this egoistic fellow! Goodness! If I really get caught by him, I will be caught in a spell of worst luck and might end up not finding that woman. Go back Sister! -Swati. Are you well? I am well. Hello, sister. -Come. Hi, Bunty. How are our parents? Everyone is doing well. Just go on up the stairs. I’ll get you some coffee. Alright. You come What are you doing here? Exactly my question. What are you doing here? This is my brother-in-law’s house. Oh? Are you really going to use that excuse to come to my neighbor’s house and make sure I don’t have any memories of you? You ruined my entire plan. Couldn’t you have waited for two more days? Do you really like me so much? Hello? Hello? Why are you rushing forward like a train on a single track?! Alright, fine. Since we are together, it doesn’t matter who made the first move. Now I understand how much love you have for me. How naughty. Couldn’t you have confessed your feelings for me yesterday itself on the beach? What? Don’t worry at all. I will never tell anyone that you came here for me. You don’t tell anyone either. Well, your brother-in-law is an egotistical fellow. I will try to manage the situation somehow. Let’s try to meet each other every day in secret... And let us love each another every day Ok? Hi. -Hi. Hey. Hey, why are you coming from up there? Having the airport so close to one’s house is such a bother! Paragliding. Oh, you landed in the wrong place, huh? Paragliding isn’t done here. It’s in Bangkok. Man, you aren’t as foolish as you look. Well, my ego is satisfied. But my logic is still not satisfied. Why did you come from up there? Guru, I am your neighbour. How does it matter where I come from? It does. If you are a neighbour, you should come from the side. Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! You held me by my collar, right? -Yes, very tightly! I will stay here. I will not go home. My ego is hurt! You have an ego too? Ego is like a BMW car. It’s easy to buy one but it’s exhausting to maintain it! Your ego is nothing compared to mine. Get out from here. Everyone claims to have such a huge ego! Oh, it’s you. What happened? Why aren’t you picking up my call? How many times should I call you? Get in the car. What? Were you worried that someone kidnapped me? It doesn’t matter if you are kidnapped. These days, I am tensed just looking at you. What will people think? What will they think? They will simply think it’s romance before our wedding. Try behaving like a girl for a bit at least. Please. Why? Should boys be the only ones to bring up romance? Shouldn’t women talk about it? Where are you taking me? Today, my father is at home. I want you to meet him once. Oh? You mean you are going to make me meet your dad and bring up the topic of a marriage. No, no. Just casual meeting. I will not force you if you don’t like it. Despite that, I will never let you go. Hi, daddy. -Hi, dear. Hi, uncle. -Hi, Siddhu. How are you? I am fine, uncle. How are you? Since I am a politician... I spend a lot more time on the streets rather than at home. Now, I come to my very own home as a guest. Siddhu. Uncle. Please ask your parents to meet me. I want to sit down and talk to them. Okay, uncle. But, well... Daddy, we will talk later Come. Bye -Bye, dear. Sir, who is that boy? If everything works out, he will become my son-in-law. What does he do? He is a topper in the civil services examination. He finished all the necessary training. He is waiting to be posted. What about your daughter? The boy worked hard and secured a rank. While she continued to flirt with him and failed the examinations. Hi, aunty. -Hi, Nidhi. What is it, mother? Looks like you are singing my praises to your friend. I do want to show off. I want Siddhu to become my son-in-law so that I can show off to the entire world around. He isn’t the kind to agree to things just because I like him and you wish for him to be your son He does something only if he likes it. But once he likes something, even if we persuade him to let it go, he will never let it go. That is the reason why I am trying to mould myself according to his tastes. Hello? What’s up? Didn’t you eat? Why are you devouring that book? Goodness. I hope she isn’t reading the book because of me. If people like you are neighbours, books such as these are a necessity. What is this, Swati? We are neighbors. Like the directions east and west, we should be harmonious when we are beside each other. Why become sarcastic like some couple who’s broken up? I didn’t understand a word you said. I didn’t say a word. I am speaking with my mouth whereas you are speaking with your eyes. I can’t see properly because you are too far. Shall I come closer? Are you always up to such nonsense? Don’t you have anything better to do? Hello? I am an IAS officer. IAS. Yeah, I know what it means. You are always smart, huh? No. It means I and Swati. I am coming there. If you come here, I will shout. Go ahead and shout. Let me watch. Hey! What the hell? I will scream. Let’s see you scream. I will scream. Scream. Brother-in-law! Did you climb up with a ladder? Couldn't you have landed with your paragliding? Right from the start of the morning, that old man keeps talking about manners and culture. Jumping the fence is manners, huh? As soon as you see women, you are just going to jump around like a bull, is it? How can an innocent woman like you survive amongst such lustful men? We teach them that it’s scary out there and it’s safe at home. Where as you guys come into the house and flirt with women. People like you shouldn’t be let scot free. You should be hanged at the village square. If you do that, your brother-in-law’s reaction is going to soil my character. There’s really nothing new to be soiled here. What does that mean? I am a rotten person? If that’s the case, I will really come there. If that’s the case, I will scream for sure. I will see if that happens. Hey, this isn’t right. If anyone catches us, it’s going to look really bad. You mean it’s okay if no one sees us? Didn’t you come for me? Now that I want to come there for you, why would you say no? Brother-in-law. Swati! What is this? I was scared that if you were out there you might be seduced. Now that you are home, how can you be seduced right here in the house? Looking at the way you carried yourself, I assumed you were naïve and innocent. Though you’ve covered yourself up completely, you seem more dangerous than those women who are dressed in skimpy clothes. It’s because of girls like you, who end up raising mens’ temperatures and keep saying that they shouldn’t get old, and finally ruin their manhood. What do I tell your parents? What about the honor of my house? Disgusting! How much longer are you going to keep dreaming. If you do that, your character will be ruined. To ensure that neither of us ruin our reputations, it’s best you stay right there. You stop reading that book and take some rest. I will plan what needs to be done next. Okay? Good night. Bye. Come on. We lost the match! A loss of 30K. Dear, did you lose again? Did you lose the money? Did I ever bet on a losing horse? We won. Well, would you buy me a new phone? Did I ever break a promise? Goodness, this added expense. Thinking of expenses, we need to pay bunty’s school fees. Where is Bunty? He is at our neighbor’s place. If that’s the case, ask the neighbors to pay the fees. Why will the neighbor’s pay our child’s school fees? I mean... Why would the neighbors be willing to pay our child’s school fees? Yes, it’s our child. Even though he was born in this house, he grew up entirely in that house! Ask them to pay the fees! We lost the match and now the fees as well! Of course, children are going to go to the neighbor’s homes. If I take my son along with me, everyone keeps asking me if he is the neighbor’s kid. Though we are the ones who gave birth to him, they are imprinting themselves on him. Ask them to pay. What sort of a logic is that, husband? It’s not logic. It’s Law. If someone rents a house and stays there continuously for a span of 10 years, that house becomes theirs. I am not talking about the house. I am just asking them to pay his fees. That’s also a problem? Such bad karma! His ego is vexing me! What happened, sister? He is putting me through hell because of his foolish ego. Where is the coffee? I am getting it. Here. Take this coffee and splash it all over his face! Okay Don’t take me literally. Just go and give it to him. I know that, sister. Ketika Sharma. Brother-in-law, coffee. I asked her to get it. Why did you bring it? Looks like she’s developed an attitude. Wait. I’ll go and set it right. All this happens in the open kitchen. Nothing happens behind locked doors. Bring it out. How long should I sit there? Go and sit there. How delicate. Get me some coffee. How does it matter who brings it for you? You won’t get it. It’s a matter of ego. This is how my fate’s written. One day, I will give you a lesson on it. Did you wear lipstick? Lipstick? Of course, not. Didn’t I tell you that you mustn’t wear lipstick unless it’s my birthday or our anniversary? What about the rest of the days? Ask her to wear chapstick. If her lips crack, I will be the one who will end up suffering. Rub it off. With a wet cloth. No kisses or anything of that sort and yet you want to wear lipstick Go inside. Brother-in-law, I need to talk to you about something. Do you want the tattoo “my brother-in-law is my God”? Please, listen to me. Tell me. The other day, I met someone at the beach. Didn’t I tell you? Guys of Vizag go wild even for ordinary faces. So what now? He said he liked me. He told me that he would come to where I lived. He challenged me. He will definitely lose. I am confident that no one would come here. That is why I brought you from there and made you stay here. The problem is right here. He is coming. It’s not that easy. To enter into our colony, their Aadhaar needs to be authenticated and my phone gets and OTP. Well, brother-in-law... -Shhh! That fellow will not be able to set foot within our boundaries. Forget about him landing on the roof! He’s jumping over our walls without setting foot in our perimeter. Who is it? Siddhu, our neighbor. Siddhu! you keep the company of one woman and court the other. Since I am intelligent, I figured this out fast. You don’t worry. I wouldn’t be this bothered if he touched you. I am quite bothered because he hurt my ego. So, you will not have any problems from neither him nor anyone else. I will make sure it stays that way. I made a mistake, sir. Please let me go. Did the courage that you have when there were people surrounding you, turn into fear in the midst of these four walls? The monstrosity of Rajappa in Macharla. Rajappa brutally murdered the district Collector. Did you see me murder the district collector? Did you see it? Do you want to see it? Macharla has a history. There was never a man born who pointed fingers at Rajappa nor raised voice against Rajappa’s emp And no such man ever lived. Didn’t I tell you 30 years ago that Macharla is Unanimous?! If you come and want to start the elections, all the men of the constituency will raise up again Watching your death will ensure that for the next 30 years, no one would ever entertain such thoughts. You came with him. Do you want to give him company when he dies? Or do you want to go home to your family? Do you want to see? Now write. Veera! Deaths because of hunger are not good for us. Feed him until his belly is full and send him away. Don't talk too much about Rajappa. But if ever do, you are as good as dead. Sister? What is it, Swati? Does brother-in-law know an advocate by the name Satya Murthy What for? Nothing, sister. It’s just research for my project. He doesn’t know anyone other than that tattoo artist. Please, sister. I really need to meet him. Let’s ask brother-in-law. Do you see that photo? Just to satiate his ego, he’s put us out of focus. You really won’t get any help from him. Let’s do this. Our neighbor is a well-connected man. Let’s go and ask him. -Alright, let’s go. Hi aunty. Hi, Sukanya. Come in, come in. This is my uncle’s daughter Swati. Namaste, aunty. -The girl looks very pleasing. That means my mother likes her as well. Come, sit down. Sit down, dear. Swati here wants to meet advocate Satya Murthy. We just wanted to know if uncle knew him. That is why we came by. Advocate Satya Murthy? One minute. Hi, Siddhu. Do you or your father know of an advocate named Satya Murthy? Murthy uncle? I know him. He is a family friend. Well, call him at once and tell him that I am on my way to meet him. Share his location with me. Okay? Bye. Siddhu? Hello? Who do you have to meet? Why would you need my dad for such a small introduction? I am here, aren’t I? An advocate called Satya Murthy, Siddhu. Satya Murthy? Yes, Murthy uncle! He is very very very close to me, you know? When do you have to go? I will take you there. Come. Not me, Siddhu. It’s for Swati. Oh, it’s not you? It’s for Swati? Siddhu, she is young. Just take her with you. What else, dear? Problem’s solved, isn’t it? Actually, Siddhu is the problem. My husband is most surely not going to agree if Siddhu is going to take her. I have a plan for that. Eat. Is that an apple? -Dear! Swati has to take care of something outside. Did you see that? She just came into the house very recently and she’s asking me permission to go out. Did you ever ask me permission? You just keep taking money from me. Why are you pouting like Samantha? Well, I just said it to make it sound cool. Tell her that permission is granted. Here. It’s good that you gave her the permission. But when Siddhu was asked to accompany her, he said no. Good riddance. He is a nuisance! That’s not it. Someone as strict as you gave her the go ahead. Now if he says no, isn’t your ego being trampled upon? Yes, it is. Tell him that I told him to go. He will have no choice. He said that if you command him, he will most definitely not go at all. Siddhu! Siddhu, I need to talk to you. You are already talking to me. Tell me. You said you aren’t going to do something that my wife asked you to. Yes. You and I don’t get along, right? What do you mean you and I don’t get along? I don’t like you at all. But you and my wife do get along, right? If she asks you, shouldn’t you oblige? I won’t go. You must. I will not. You must! Couldn’t you have said this directly instead of over the phone? If I did it directly, it would sound like a request. If I did it over the phone, it would sound like a command. You should go! Should go! Should go! I will not go! I will not go! I will go! I'll see... He’s going? Isn’t that what I wanted? Sorry, boss. -It's OK The girl is hot I didn’t see that. Sorry... Sorry... What the hell is this? Swathi! Get down Leave it. Get down -Leave it. I am going to screw them up. -It's ok Let's go... -Get down. Hey, move... move... Hey wait. Brother, please....please...please... Move.. move... Siddhu, take it easy. If you get into a fight with them, it’s going to turn into a problem for us. It’s easy to get into fights but very difficult to get out. Your life is completely different, Siddhu. You are a soon to be Civil servant. This isn’t your life. This is my life. If something goes wrong right in front of my eyes. I cannot stop myself from reacting. That's why I chose civil services. Civil servant is not just a job. It’s a responsibility. Mom tell me, what’s up? What happened? You seem very irritable. Nothing, while getting here, someone on the road irritated me. Did you thrash him? -I would have. But Swati was beside me. That is why I let it go. Where would that fellow go? I am sure he lives in Vizag. Someday when the stars are not in his favour, he will cross paths with you. Can’t you see? Are you blind? Or do you have any eye problem? Sorry, grandpa.... Mom you are right... He had a bad time Take it.. take it. Good! I will try my level best. Thank you sir Are you done? It didn't.. but I hope it will be done My little heart went into shock as soon as it got hit by a high voltage. A lightening that is 5 feet 8 inches tall fell upon me. My little heart went into shock as soon as it got hit by a high voltage. A lightening that is 5 feet 8 inches tall fell upon me. Am I intoxicated? Am I born anew? Oh my dear, are you the reason? I am chasing after you. See how much I love you. Won’t you reciprocate even a little? You heartless woman. You are harmful to the male kind. With me, you are a queen. Please give me a chance. If you can, give me a kiss. Even if grudgingly, give me a hug If you are angry, slap me. Whatever it is, react to me. When I watch your lips in a high speed shot, I don't know what happened But suddenly the whole world freeze Even the moonlight pales in comparison to you. My entire soul has turned light and is floating about. Even if I seem a little exaggerated on the outside, My love for you is true. Even if you ask me to leave, I will not go. This life of mine is yours. No matter how many years, my love for you will not diminish. Please give me a chance. You heartless woman. You are harmful to the male kind. With me, you are a queen. Please give me a chance. If you can, give me a kiss. Even if grudgingly, give me a hug If you are angry, slap me. Whatever it is, react to me. I have to be the one to remind every Tom, Dick and Harry! Dear! -Remove your hand! Happy wedding anniversary. Same to me. Since today is our wedding anniversary, I will wear lipstick, please. There’s red mud out there. Smear it all over your lips! I'm annoyed because no one calling me! Even though I gave you a missed call, you guys didn’t call me. Wish me, come on. Tell me. Brother, I got missed call from you. Yeah, as if you are a Miss Universe! And that’s why you missed my call! It’s my wedding anniversary today. I’ve been busy with unending calls. Oh? Happy wedding anniversary, brother. Thank you. How nice of you to remember it and call me. Well, brother. You gave me a missed call... Stupid nonsense! Cut the call! I have a lot more calls to attend. Every idiot calls me and disturbs me. Hi! Why would you add such wild moves for just montage song. I am on a small high. All good vibes. Sit down. You think just because he enjoyed a few minutes of your company and sang a song with you, do you think she has fallen for you? Yeah... Almost. That won’t happen. I will not let that happen. Why? My ego doesn’t allow that. What does your ego need in order to be satisfied? I want respect! Tell me how much of respect do you want? I’ll place the order in Swiggy. Yeah, right. Please go ahead and order. Half a kilo of respect and a quarter kilo of Pav Bhaji. From which hotel? -You....! I mean RESPECT. I want respect. Okay, Guru ji. Just because you address me with respect, is that all? Along with ‘ji’, I have added something else as well. Take a look at it, Guruji. -What did you put... You might have bought me with this. But you cannot buy my ego. I will size it to fit me. What else do you want me to do, Guruji? Generally, what do you usually do if it was your parents’ wedding anniversary? I will celebrate it. What if it’s yours? I’ll go crazy. What if it was mine? Oh you mean....hey.....hey.... Happy anniversary, Guruji. We’re going to have a party in the evening. It’s going to be on another level. I don’t like things like that. I am a private person. Please.... please... Just for me...for me... Alright, alright. Do a grand job of it. If not, I will return the ring back to you. Okay. Srikanya. Oh no! Sukanya. -Yes, Dear. Do you still have the lipstick or did you use it all up? How can it be all used up when I haven’t used it at all? Use it. Thank you. -Why did you sit? Get up! Turn that side. Happy wedding anniversary. Hi, aunty. The girl looks like a goddess. Do you really think that woman is that good-looking? Do you like her a lot? Are you fixated on having her as your daughter-in-law? If you are okay with it, I am okay with it as well. I’ll go and speak with her right now. Siddhu! Siddhu! He is the perfect match for Lord Rama He is better than the little moon. The boy who thinks this of her is going to be married Dear moon.... dear moon.... Look down. Look at the at this moon down on this earth You are sure to be stunned. Dear moonlight.... dear moonlight Go on and feel dejected that you hold no candle to our beautiful lady here. What happened, Guruji? Why are you sleeping like that? I am feeling kiddish. Awwww! Don’t say awwww. You said it was an anniversary party. But you ended up getting me remarried to her. I am really feeling kiddish. So cute, Guruji. Nothing Cute! Well, what’s everyone talking about? Talk? Yes, they say it’s next level stuff. They said that you look like a movie hero. What happened, Guruji? Why are you praising someone else in front of me? Wow! When you don’t let even your shadow overshadow you... I must admit you are the father of egotistical behavior! Now I am satisfied. But I am not satisfied. But I am satisfied. I am telling you that I am not satisfied. Fine, what do you want me to do for your satisfaction? I am feeling nostalgic. -Nostalgic? Has there been really such a long gap? Gap? What do you mean a ‘gap’? Well, I mean when children grow up, they usually get distant from their parents. It’s pretty common, isn’t it, Guruji? Oh, you mean that. No...no... Yes, there is a huge gap. I have a very good medicine to cure you of your blues and bring you back to form, Guruji. Is it Redbull? No. it’s bed bull. Do you really think this will help me regain my vitality? Not back to your vitality. Much more than that. You will score all the time and you will knock it out of the park. Knocking it out of the park is really not necessary. I want to perform like Dhoni. A six here and a few runs there And I want to finish it in style. Oh yeah, wow! Put it in your mouth and rage like a bull. What about Bunty? I will take care of Bunty. You go ahead and enjoy. Meenakshi? Lekapshi? Enjoy. Go away.. go... Swathi! Today you are going to know a few things about me I wonder what that is. Flirting and dating is a waste of time If you want to know their character, listen to the playlist on the phone You are going to know about my character with only three songs Is this really necessary, Siddhu? -Of course, they are very necessary. Take it. Brother... -Tell me you planned that with my father just to impress her, isn’t it? Yes. Yes, I used betelnut leaf wrap to coax your father. Now I am going to impress Swati here. 1st song.. from the film ROJA My age has showered as the rain Youth is drenched in love and kisses There’s Amalapuram in that direction. There’s Peddapuram in this direction. There’s Godavari flowing in between. You listen to these things? I am a nature lover, right? Do you know the reason why I studied so hard? These songs. You should listen to them as well. It will change you. Next song, please. Second song is from Varsham. You’ve turned into a needle of a raindrop And pricked me Please don’t leave. My dear sweet rain. Ah means Amalapuram. Aaah means pleasure town. Ee means the place of your liking. The people of Andhra will whistle and call for you. You listen to these songs? These are the kind of songs that should be heard. Do you know why people exercise and do yoga? It’s to make sure one’s mind stays fresh. You should listen to it as well. It will really clear your mind. Please play the final number. The third song from Narasimha. Get on the first step. You must find out. Go on and do it. Yoga is good for your body. Don’t be lazy and let your body out of shape. Hey, this isn’t my phone. This is your brother in law's phone. Just a minute, my phone This is my phone Please listen these songs That’s enough songs for today, please. Swathi! wait. My plan to impress you with the songs failed. I don’t know how to woo you with my words. But, the feelings for you that you see in my eyes are true. Whatever you understood from it.... that is true as well. Let’s talk about those things later. Come on, let’s go. Guruji, may I come in? Come in. What about sister-in-law? Even your sister-in-law asked you to come in. Come in. Guruji? Guruji? Come. Did you stay awake the whole night? You look like a lion exhausted from making a kill. A lion you say? Ask your sister-in-law. Sister-in-law? Sister-in-law? Where is Sister-in-law? In the lobby! -What do you mean? You’ve ruined my night with your eagerness You locked me up in the room! Couldn’t you have called me? When did you give me that opportunity? I will take care of it. You eat it. What about these marks on your body? When I tie my saree. You guys look like you want to bite me. When I wear a short dress. You keep constantly staring at me. It doesn’t matter if it’s a saree or a dress. How does the garb matter? It’s all in your gaze. All men are very twisted. Will you say yes? Or will you say no? If I am fair, men just go crazy. If I am dark, they create such a huge fuss. Will you say yes? Or will you say no? You mean to say that the betelnut wrap worked really well. Yes, really well. They asked me to fast and gave me lemon juice. It’s not tablet for diarrhea. Sorry, Guruji. I didn’t expect such a thing to happen. Did you bear a grudge against me and plan all this? Stop it, Guruji. Why will I bear a grudge against you? Why was that betelnut leaf wrap so powerful? Would you like me to plan this again for another day? I don’t want you plan nor your betelnut leaf wrap. Guruji. Don’t touch me. Just go. Please leave me alone for some time. Please, leave. Just go. Why was that betelnut leaf wrap so powerful? I cannot help you in this matter, lady. Please, sir. I am sorry. You can leave. Do you remember this place, Siddhu? This is the place where we met for the first time. This is one of the most important places of my life. How can I forget it? That day when I met you, I thought I was going to end up with a lot of problems because of you. But surprisingly, you turned out to be a great help. You took me to every place that I wanted to go to. You helped me meet every one that I wanted to meet with. You spent all of your time on me. I will never forget you all my life, Siddhu. Thank you, Siddhu. Too much ego will kill your talent My foot! Who is this fool? Guruji, I am here. I don’t understand Hindi. You got both the flowers and the stems. I wonder why. I came to propose. To whom? Who else? Swati, of course! Stop! Take those flowers and tuck them between your ears. And take the stems and shove it down. Why do you say that, Guruji? Swati isn’t here anymore. She finished what she came here for and so she went back home. Where did she go? Swati went somewhere... Now, Siddhu is all alone. Oh, cool breeze... Give me her address... Did you already know about this? I did. Why didn’t you tell me, Guru? Guru? Where is the respect that should have been there? I suffered through you all these days because of Swati. Now that she is gone, why would I still address you respectfully? Siddhu, you are provoking my ego. I will break you... Where is Swati? Macharla. Siddhu, what did Swati say? Hey, hold on. Why are you leaving without answering me? Did she agree? Swati wasn’t there to give me an answer, mother. Where did she go? Macharla. She is from Macherla? She is from our village. What are you saying, mother? It’s true. Your father’s holds a great reputation there. Really? My father holds such huge reputation? He might look a little silly but those days the way your father carried himself...was huge. As soon as they know that you are his son, her parents are going to marry her off to you in a heartbeat. Go...go... Go and get me my daughter-in-law. Oh, my daddo. Thank you, thank you so much mother. Finally, you are here. Why are you so late? Come, let’s eat. Where is Siddhu? Ask him to join us. Let’s eat together. He is not here. He went to Swati next door. Swati? These days he’s been spending way too much time with her. If Nidhi gets to know about it, it might not bode well. Tell him that. He didn’t go with Swati. He went to meet Swati. He’s gone to propose to Swati and get her here. Have you gone crazy? When Nidhi is here, why would he go and propose to Swati? He’s decided that he wants Swati as his wife. And I have already made up my mind that Swati is going to be my daughter-in-law. If you make up your mind, you would be peaceful too. Tell me that I would die in peace. Is it okay if you decide and okay it amongst yourselves? Shouldn’t you tell me about it? Am I an idiot? If Nidhi gets to know about it, she might get us killed. Do you understand what’s going on? Where exactly did Siddhu go? Macharla. Macharla? Why are you so shocked after hearing that name? Did you forget what you did there? Perhaps you don’t know about me because you are new here. No matter who comes here, they will have to obey me. They have to do my bidding. Rajappa! I seem quite tamed because I occupy this position. If I set this aside, I am an even bigger goon than you are. You told me only about the warning between the two of you during our wedding preparations? What would have happened if I told you the rest? I would have said ‘Disgusting’! That is why I didn’t say the rest. Given the half-baked truth you told me, I assumed you hold such high reputation and sent Siddhu there. Now, what do we do? Oh no! why is she calling me now? Give her any excuse that you want to. Here. Both the son and his mother will cost me my life! Hello, Nidhi. Uncle, I keep calling Siddhu but he is not lift my phone. Where is he? Siddhu... He...I... What happened, uncle? Is anything wrong? Oh.... nothing’s wrong, dear. Well, where is Siddhu then? -Siddhu is... Tell me -Tell her! He went with our neighbor Swati. Your neighbor Swati? Who is she? You mean to say he eloped with her? No...no...no... Of course, not. When you are still around. But...he... Tell her that Siddhu eloped. But something similar to that. Nidhi, don’t take these things to heart. I will make sure you guys are together. It’s my responsibility. Are you there? I wonder what she’s going to do. What are you looking at? Serve me food. I would like to eat before I die. Serve me. Do you know her? You are young and you are a girl. Instead of focusing on your business, why are you trying to get in our way? Have you lost all fear after you stepped out of the village? If anyone loses their fear of us, they can no longer live. Siddhu, why did you come here? Please leave, Siddhu. Please leave. Siddhu, please. Who the hell are you? Who the hell one hit her? She is a girl. Why would you do that to a girl? If you are that brave, deal with me. Deal with me! Come! Come! Come and hit me! Hit me! Hit me! Who the hell are you? Who are you? Veera! Our issue is with her. Who are you to interfere? What did she do?! She is his granddaughter! She wants to go to Vizag to file cases against us because we killed her brother. No matter what you do in the entire state, we will surely know about it. Is that the reason why she took me around the whole of Vizag? I understand what your problem is. But what you don’t understand is that... I am in love with that girl. I came here just to tell her that. I am there for Swati. After that, it’s your wish. How foolish of you to propose your feelings when it’s a question of life and death? There are thirty of us here. A total of three have already fallen. There are 27 left. And including me, it’s 28. Someone or the other amongst us will kill you. This isn’t your place, neither is it your village. Why are you interfering? Just leave the way you came. If we talk this out, it would be the decent thing to do. But if you want to use your fists, your bodies are going to be couriered to your families. I don’t think he understands what’s happening. He’s come here seeking death. Go ahead and kill the both of them. Siddhu! Tell me. I am busy. How can you get busy already? Just tell me. What is it, father? We got the letter of your posting. Posting? Where I have been posted? It’s in Guntur district. Where? -Guntur district. Guntur district. A while ago someone asked me 'Who are you'? Where is he? There’s good news for all of you here. From now on, I am the district collector for you all, this village and the entire Guntur distric Siddhu.. Siddhardh Reddy, IAS. Why do I care who you are? I am Rajappa’s son! You came to Macharla and dare manhandle Rajappa’s son?! Rajappa, Veerappa, Kattapa or whoever the bloody fellow he is! No matter who they are, this is going to be the treatment for all! The thing that counts isn’t how many people you started with. All that matters is who is left standing. Since I got posted here as the district collector, I tamed my fists a little. If I hit with the full force I could, I don’t think your body would ever be able to get up! Veera... go and tell this to your father Rajappa. Until now, beasts have hunted humans And now, the hunter who is going to hunt that beasts down has set foot in Macharla. From now on, things are going to be operated at a different level! Despite having her family with her, if a girl fights hard by putting her life at stake, there could only be two reasons. She must have a strong desire for something. Or else, she must have lost strength. Who is Rajappa? What is the issue between him and your family? This issue is not something that’s recent. It began 30 years ago. My grandfather supported his son in the elections against Rajappa. On the day of the elections, they killed him. Rajappa would be elected unanimously and made sure that no voting in the elections took place. Every one here is used to living with a constant fear of Rajappa My brother did not want to live in that fear and wanted to change this situation and the people Please listen to me. Just as you desired, you became a civil servant. Instead of enjoying yourself, why would you want to pick a fight with Rajappa? Please don’t do that, son. Father, the fear inside us is even more dangerous than the fear he instills in us. Any case, I am not targeting Rajappa. I am just targeting the fear within the people. It’s not that easy, son. It’s not that hard either, father. If free and fair elections are conducted here once, the people here will be filled with courage. Elections are not a five-year affair where ink is smeared on the fingers. It’s about the future. Even though my brother died, I came to Vizag to keep his ideals and vision alive. You said that you wanted to study. Instead, you brought death along with you. She lost her husband right in front of her eyes. That kid lost her father. You can see them and their state right in front of your eyes. How did you get the courage to go against Rajappa? Did you forget how Rajappa killed your brother? I didn’t forget it father. I am doing all this because I didn’t forget. Have you gone crazy? Sir, she wants to do something that you couldn’t do for your son. Let her do it, sir. Young man, since you are new here, you don’t know the situation and the environment here. I know that you came for my daughter. As a father I am telling you this. If possible, take her back with you. At least then, the both of you will stay alive. Should I run away and save myself? Or else, should I save justice by staying back? One minute sir, Rajappa doesn’t tolerate anyone hitting his men. And now, this guy goes and bashes Rajappa’s son! Do you think Rajappa will stay quiet? He will kill him. He will kill everyone. What happened? Who are they? It’s not ‘they’. It’s just one person. It must be because he doesn’t know it’s us. He knew who we were and still hit us. Hey! Have you lost your masculinity just because one person thrashed you? He didn’t hit you. He hit the reputation that I built for the past 30 years. Where is he?! Father, I love you. I don’t know why but whenever you tell me that you love me, my heart beats even faster. I came here for Swati and you got me posted here. You are indeed superb, father! Oh? Is that how you understood this? Do you know what happened? Even the water in your house tastes delicious. What is this, dear? Marriage muhurat? Hold on. What did we agree on? I remember it, dear. It’s my responsibility to get him married to you. And you would convince your father to make sure that... Nice coffee sir he doesn’t get posted to Guntur district. Isn’t that right? Now, take a look at that. So, you are not going to tell me, huh? Why didn’t you smear the corners with some turmeric and saffron? That’s the posting letter of your son as the new collector of the Guntur district. This is unfair, isn’t it? If what I did is unfair. What you did to me is unfair as well. The deal is cancelled. How can you break it off so easily? Why does the water taste weird? A little while ago, you said that the water tasted delicious. I did say that. I would say hundred such things in the sweet anticipation that the posting would be according to How could you believe it all? Shall I tell you something else as well? Will you listen to it? Will you be able to bear with it The coffee served at your house is disgusting! Go and tell your mother that! That is exactly what happened. She...she is my true friend. And you.... have you ever helped me with any such favors? That is how friends ought to be. She is ready to do anything for me. Listen, no matter what you listen to, do you always end up twisting it in your favor? Why are you saying something that is completely out of tune with the situation that’s going on? Alright, fine. Cut the call. I’ll call you back. If he stopped at the center, I am sure someone is going to be at the receiving end of his ire. Please don’t stop. Keep moving. Keep moving. I must appreciate your courage that you are still in Macherla after raising your hand on Rajappa How dare you? Oh, you are Rajappa? If you are thrashed, you should turn into a patient. I was wondering why is it that you turned o The father and son look pretty much the same. The genes must be really strong. The both of you look exactly the same. No, sir. Would-be Collector. It's a public place, sir. The issue is getting bigger, we would find it difficult to control it, sir. Sir...please...listen to me. You are new to this district. But district administrative officers are not new to me. Fear in this town was born even before you were born. For 30 years, there hasn’t been a single person who revolted against me or spoke against me. Usually, I am not the one to give chances. But I am giving you one. I am going to flip a coin. If it’s heads, you are going to meet your maker. If it’s tails, leave this town. You are lucky. It’s tails. Leave Macherla and run away today itself. you might find yourself alive! You are extremely lucky. No one in this entire world has gotten a chance like you did. He would always flip a coin. And this is the first time that it’s tails. There isn’t anyone who is as lucky as you. Pack up...pack all your bags. And start immediately. Yes, make a call. Talk to whoever you wish to. Change your posting from this place. And get out of here immediately. Sir, are you always like this? Are you in a state of constant fear? Young man, this is Macharla. Only those who fear will be able to survive here. Aunty, it’s you? Please come in...Come in. How are you? I am fine.. How are you? I am also fine. All of a sudden, why did you get here? What’s with all those injuries? It’s nothing. Just small scuffle. Why would you dismiss it like it’s nothing? Why did she get here? Well, apparently you weren’t picking her calls. That is why, she came along with us. Hey, Nidhi. How are you? Oh, wow! It is scintillatingly hot! Hey, Narender. -Surender How long has it been since I last saw you? What made you come by so suddenly? There. I came for my son. He’s your son? Are you guys already acquainted with each other? You didn’t tell her anything about us? He’s someone who keeps a lot of secrets. Lady, we were... To tell you the truth, I am partially paralyzed by fear. I don’t know what to do. People like me who are born here have no choice since we were born and raised here. But why did you pick a fight with him? It just happened. How would I know how dangerous a fellow he is?! Tell me what do I do now? What’s there to do? If you want to stay alive, you better run away from this place. Father and son are a perfect match. That day, you listened to my words. But now, your son doesn’t heed my words. What happened? As soon as he came to town, he picked a fight with Rajappa. You came at the right time. Knock some sense into him. My son was stubborn like him and I ended up losing him. Why all this fuss? Siddhu. -Father. I desperately hoped that you wouldn’t be posted into this district. But you ended up getting posted here. No matter what the reasons are and who’s responsible for this... This is enough. We don’t need these fights. Please listen to me. Let’s get out of here. Yes, Siddhu. Let it go, son. Alright, father. Let’s go. But look into the eyes of Swati who lost her brother and the little girl who lost her father. And then, we can leave. This isn’t the problem of a family. It is a problem for the entire constituency. There’s no going anywhere. I am going to take charge as the District collector here. If there is no opposition, the kingdom belongs to those who threaten. Let’s face them. Sir, every time there is an election, I donate money. But the party has never given me an opportunity for their candidature. This time, I need a ticket to contest. Sir, no matter which constituency you ask me to be a candidate, I am confident that I will emerg All the seats for the state have been confirmed. We’ve already given 'B-forms' But there is an opportunity for one seat. Where? -Macharla. If we are asked to contest for Macharla, we will surely lose our lives. This time again, Macharla is unanimous. MRO's and RTO's are eagerly awaiting for the newly appointed District Collector! It's like setting up a canopy for a wedding that would never happen. The Collector won't come! Before coming here, he had a tiff with Rajappa in his place, Macherla. With the warning that Rajappa gave him, he would have run away from the state itself. Oh no! He came here You said he ran away. Alright, alright. What’s this bouquet for? Just a formality sir They look fresh. Put them in the fridge. Anyway, he will be killed by him. Tomorrow, we can visit his grave and arrange for a tombstone for his grave. Why waste money buying a new one? Go! Congratulation, sir. I am Jaya Shankar. MDO of Sattenapalle Thank you. Sir, I am Katta Srihari RDO of Tenali. Narayana, MRO of Macharla. Marchala? I have a lot of work with you. Keep in touch. All the best. Shouldn't I wish him luck? Why is he wishing me? Sir, a civil servant needs to deal with things delicately. How can you start off on the wrong no I shall take my leave, sir. What's up, Mr.Narayan? Is he your son? He seems to be pretty fired up. Your logic is correct. When the CM uses violence, you applaud it. When it comes to civil servants, everyone expects them to deal with things delicately. But I am born a bit violent. What do I do? Well said, bro. Super! They ring the bell at school. But our brother is built commercial! Why would you pass such reviews at the press meet? Stop it! Stop it! As a young officer, this is your first posting. What sort of changes can we expect in the distri Even before you took charge, your reputation caught on like wild fire. What are your comments, p There are no comments, shares or likes. Direct action. This is awesome, Rajappa. Private place, liquor and meat... all the arrangements look brilliant. Here...here...I am sure things like this reaction Before someone else tells you about it, I came to tell you this myself. I have taken charge as the district collector Since it was in the center, I held myself back and informed you the norms very patiently. If you dare to oppose me again... Aren’t you scared of death? This is what fear of death means. Perhaps hailing from Macharla instills fear. But since I am not from Macharla, I am not scared. I didn’t come here to fight. I came here to talk about something else. Doing things the proper way. As you’ve pointed out, I am new to this district. That is why from now on, everything will feel new. My task is to make sure that elections take place in this constituency. Why are you still looking at me? I said what I came to say. It’s true. Believe me. If you tell me what needs to be said, I will listen to it and leave. Assume that this is people and this is fear which I instilled It cannot be separated Oh my God! What a dialogue delivery, Mr. Rajappa! The oldie seems to be a big film junkie. Hold on...hold on.... Stop. He keeps talking like the prose of Trivikram Srinivas. You guys have the action prowess of Boyap What do I do now? Shall I present myself as the hero is presented in Rajamouli’s movies? Since all of you are very enthusiastic, I would ask the most accomplished amongst you to come fo Just one punch. If I don’t get your hearts racing.... I swear on Rajappa’s son. Come on, my passionate king. You are going to have a jolly time this night. This is the fear you’ve instilled in people. Hey, learn to stay within your limits or else you would be cut loose! At times like this, do you know what the most frequently said words by the victor are? Come on, let’s have at it! Shall we start? (TV NEWS) Siddhu! Siddhu, I am sorry. I didn’t really grasp the gravity of the situation here and got you posted here. My actions in anger have caused you great suffering. I will speak to my father and get you posted elsewhere. Don’t do anything like that. I am sure you always have the best of intentions for me. Anyways, why have you changed your personality so suddenly? This isn’t really you. Just be yourself. I am really sorry. Direct that sorry towards me and I shall leave on my way out of here. Son-in-law. Why was your character even given a dialogue? Move away! Wait! Take it Go. Go. Hey, Guru. What a lovely surprise. Why do you keep talking about leaving when you just got here? What’s so urgent? It’s not an urgency. It’s an emergency. I want a sorry right now. You came this far for a saree? Swathi! Bring him a saree. I am talking about sorry not saree. Come, dear. Come. How wonderfully annoying! You guys indulge in romance and we end up at the receiving end of revenge. Gurunatham, why would you need to be romantic at your age? It’s not Gurunatham. Call me Guru. A sister’s son who is also your son-in-law is just like a dog. One can address him according to your liking. He assumes that every son-in-law who moves into his wife’s place is exactly like him. You already got one here. If you really want to pamper someone, go ahead and lick his mouth! What happened Guru? You seemed to be fired up, what happened? Oh, here comes the handsome hunk in the t-shirt! Has your whole family arrived here? Siddhu, even my wrinkled shirt also hurts my ego And you stripped me off my shirt and hit me! Unless you apologise to me, there is no question of you ever getting out of Macharla. I'll tell, Guru... And you’ve come here after a long time. Why don’t you enjoy the hospitality to your heart’s content before you leave? First, I need a shower. Narendra. Tell me, Surendra. Will your son submit to his ego? He didn’t care for Rajappa’s ego that’s over 30 years old. Guru’s ego is a child’s play for him. If that’s the case, it’s agreed that it’s Macharla. Why is he here? Mr Narayana Such expensive breakfast. Looks like you are used to eating such rich food. Nothing like that, sir. I am a bit health conscious. Aiming for six pack? No, sir. Everyone keeps saying that. But I am finding it so difficult to live up to the expectations. Election notification has arrived... What about the update? Hey... -Sir... How many times do I have to tell you? We will end up having only one nomination. Do we really need to waste this amount of paper? How did you decide that there’s going to be only one nomination? Apart from Rajappa, no one’s going to file a nomination. No body is courageous enough to nominate themselves against him Maybe. There might be someone. They might file for the nomination. Will something that hasn’t happened for so long happen now? Just a minute sir. Hello? Sir, I was born and brought up here. I am going to retire after three months. But thus far, I have never cast my vote, sir. Before I die, I would like to cast my vote at least once, sir. But I might die before this wish is fulfilled, sir. Hello, Where is Rajappa sir? We are out of town on business Tell me... I wanted to talk about the nomination. I will call you after I come to the village. Okay, alright. As the state is geared up with the upcoming elections, it is gripped with political buzz. This time, there will be free and fair democratic elections in Macharla. The Collector says that interested candidates can nominate themselves. The Collector said that whoever nominated the candidate would be given adequate security. What’s wrong with him? As soon as he took charge, why is he asking people to nominate themselves to their death? It’s cause he’s new. Elections in Macharla? Democracy? Where is it? Grandma, do you want to nominate yourself? Why? So that I can die? Good morning sir! -Morning. Hello? Narayana, brother Rajappa is here. Since it’s the last day for the nomination, start immediately and come here. Okay, I am leaving right away. Yes, tell him Alright. Okay. You’ve come? You said that somebody would be interested in contesting and file their nomination. Today is the last day, I haven’t got a single nomination. You go ahead and relax. I got a call. I’ll go to Rajappa’s house and get him to sign the nomination papers. Why would you go? Shouldn’t he be the one to come to you? He doesn’t come. We will have to go. That’s Rajappa’s rule. He must come to the office and file his nomination. This is the government’s rule. Government rules are all fine. It’s just that when you follow them, you end up losing your life. I don’t mind if you suspend me or dismiss me from my job or even transfer me. I am going. That’s all. Bloody Rules? Who cares about rules Sir? Yes. I am not saying this as a peon. I am saying this as a father. All these days we were scared of Rajappa. And now, we must hold the same amount of fear for him as well. Have you taken leave of your senses? You expect me to fear him? In few days, he’s going to leave this place. He isn’t the kind to leave this place in few days. As soon as he came here, he thrashed Veera. In all the years here, has it ever happened? Why go that far? When Rajappa threatened him at the town centre, he didn’t care for it at all. And we are just inconsequential, sir. Sir, he is an educated man but he isn’t a saint. I heard that before he became an officer, he was a goon. Sir, look at that Oh, God! He is taken out his tucked shirt. So what? Sir, a great danger’s been averted because the rod fell on the rock. If it fell on a person... Mr. Narayana... come. Let’s have a cup of tea. Here, have it. No thanks sir. It’s quite fresh. Have it. Sit down, sir. Now, I have a problem. Generally, I speak after I use my fists. Tell Rajappa to come. We give him a treat Call him. Sir please... You are too shy. Oh? Rajappa God? If the devotee calls for God, won’t he make an appearance? He will come. It’s ringing. Talk to him. Talk to him. Hello! What happened? Why didn’t you come here yet? We are running out of time The boss is waiting for you. I need to talk to Rajappa sir.... Please give him the phone Brother, Narayana is on the phone. Yes, tell me Narayana. Sir, sign here Congratulations Mr Narayana. At last, you’ve called him here and made him file the nomination. In time. I set foot in the assembly even before you were born. You cannot stop me. You were talking about elections and nominations. What happened? Not one person came forward. This is my seventh assembly elections. A legacy that can never be stopped. Brother, it’s Mr. Sharma. Yes, Mr. Sharma. Send me the advance. The work will be done. There was a deal worth crores of rupees Here, I am going to be elected unanimously. Both of these things happened at the same time. Now you can congratulate me. Mr Rajappa! If there is only one nomination, the victory is unanimous. How can it be unanimous if there are two nominations? Lok at there There was already a nomination. Yours was the second. Now I am going to congratulate you. Well, between the two of you, whoever wins, I really don’t care. The only thing that’s important to me is these elections happening. You aren’t thinking this through and trying to stand in our way. No matter how fast the deer runs, it lives only until the tiger catches it. Same conditions apply, until you are not in the reach of my clutches. Stop telling me the jungle book stories or I shall make your life a living hell, bloody scoundre Rajappa! Rajappa! Rajappa here. Narayana. Murthy. What is your name? So what? Raising your hand on the Collector is equivalent to raising your hand on the government. Get lost. Namaste, sir. -Namaste. For the first time there has been another nomination. On this happy occasion, we are organizing a fair in our village. You must honour us with your presence. Why don't you come? I'm fear about fair. I will not come. When I came to the centre of Macharla in the evening The moon walked into the alleys. In those misty winter days, when I slip my saree off my shoulder, You end up seeing stars during the day. When you sweat in the summer, I am going to use the corner of my saree as an A/C and fan you with it. When the couple shivers in front of the winter bonfires, I will switch on my body’s heat for them. Reddy, no matter how you call me, I am ready. will come and give you all my charms on loan. My body is like the perfume bottle filled with the scent of jasmines. Come on, Reddy Reddy, no matter how you call me, I am ready. will come and give you all my charms on loan.

Come on, girl. Please have some mercy. Just looking at the call is driving me crazy. The girl is a bomb. Just looking at the call is driving me crazy. Come on, girl. Please have some mercy. Will you love me? I am sorry. I like live-ins. I am sorry. Will you be my wife? So so sorry. I don’t want to be locked up. Sorry sorry. I am single and I am hot. I am not someone who can stay at one place. I will charge you. I will increase your heart beat. I will come back again here sometime later. Reddy, no matter how you call me, I am ready. will come and give you all my charms on loan. My body is like the perfume bottle filled with the scent of jasmines. Come on, Reddy Reddy, no matter how you call me, I am ready. will come and give you all my charms on loan. My body is like the perfume bottle filled with the scent of jasmines. Come on, Reddy That young one said she wouldn’t come. She said she wouldn’t absolutely come. But somehow, she ended up coming to the Ram Temple. That young one said she wouldn’t come. She said she wouldn’t absolutely come. But somehow, she ended up coming to the Ram Temple. That pretty one said that she wouldn’t come. She said she absolutely wouldn’t come. But she came to the farm. That young one said she wouldn’t come. And came with a basket of fruits That young one said she wouldn’t come. She said she wouldn’t absolutely come. But somehow, she ended up coming to the Ram Temple. That young one said she wouldn’t come. She said she wouldn’t absolutely come. But somehow, she ended up coming to the Ram Temple. Unidentified assailants have attacked the district collector on the very day that the nominationd. The people believe this to be the work of Rajappa. The district Collectorate issued a statement that the district collector is unharmed. The association of IAS officers have issued a harsh criticism of the attack on the collector. The new collector showed his ruthless side at the village fair. You saw that, didn’t you, Rajappa? We cannot do anything in secret Even what happens in the bedroom is telecasted on the TV. In this state, no political party in the opposition would dare put up a candidate to fight againlls. Why go that far? Even though we are in power, we didn’t do that either. And we will never do that either. That is the kind of respect we have towards you. But the issue here is that...that girl... I mean Raghavaiah’s granddaughter. She went to Vizag and took this issue to the court. Now after all this if Supreme Court decides to take Sue-moto cognizance of your case, your entire political career would be jeopardized! Once the court starts dealing with this. Forget about me. No one else can do anything else either. And it’s the time of elections. We don’t have power right now. Are you scared that you will lose if the elections take place? Is there anyone who would even go and cast their vote to another candidate? So, please heed my words and this time, let the elections happen. I am telling this for your good. Listen to me I did exactly as you asked. Looks like Rajappa agreed to elections taking place. That is enough, sir. I will take care of the rest. Even though we were in power all these years, we were never able to stop his atrocities. But looking at you, I believe that you can stop him. Whatever be the case, the elections must happen. And to ensure that that happens, my support is always with you. All the best Did you back down just because CM convinced you to? That day, you hit him. What happened to your 30 years of legacy? There was never an election here for so long and now there’s going to be one?! If we get scared of the courts and judges, tomorrow the number of nominations of our opponents w When it’s my turn, I will have to go and beg people to vote for me. Being a goon and being a politician are two different things. To be a politician, you must know exactly what to do and when. Just this once, let’s do as the CM asks. If anything goes wrong, we have our ways, don’t we? I wonder where you are off to. The elections are close by, are they not? I am going to campaign. Why? It’s only through campaign that people vote for us. Ramulu, come here. Yes, sir. Apparently, they are going to campaign. Would you vote for them? Oh goodness, no. If I vote for them, Rajappa will kill me. Go and go about your business. Not just him. No one in this entire village is going to vote for you. What a joke! Apparently, they are going to campaign. You are right, uncle. As a collector, I asked people to nominate themselves to contest the polls and not one person ca Just because they go and ask for a vote, will people really vote for them? Such a relief that after so long, you have understood me. Narendra, looks like your son changed his ways to ours. In the current situation, you have to campaign not among the people Then? In Rajappa's house Narendra. -Tell me, Surendra. What can you see on that wall? Photographs of two people who passed away. Then, why is it that I can see four people’s photographs there? What’s the discussion here? Don’t you wish to include me in it? Five photographs. The change has begun. How come you are playing without an opponent? Only if there is competition, one would get to know the courage that victory brings and the fear that losing brings. If anyone wants to win against Rajappa, he must be Rajappa. That's why I don't allow anyone to compete with me People are exactly talking about this. That elections mean fights, quarrels and debates. But conducting peaceful, free and fair elections is our responsibility. The only thing important for a kingdom is a king. But no king can rule a kingdom without people in it. The people should see their king as their strength. But the king should never be the thing that people fear. Hi, bro. How are you? Long time? The matter is... Mr Raghavaiah... Come sir... sit The latest trend is for opponents in the competition to meet with each other and wish each otherk. I have brought them here to remember these formalities Is this revenge? Revenge? Bro, are you around 30 to 35 years old? Ok, let’s assume you are 35 years old. I am someone who beat up a 35-year-old guy. But you are an old man. Beating you up is a piece of cake. There’s no revenge here. Only elections. Mr. Raghaviah, wish your opponent all the best and start the campaign Hey! I don’t need anyone’s wishes. You taking this an ego Your campaign is yours and his campaign is his. That means ask his family to vote for you and vice versa. These are friendly elections, sir. Well, you are an experienced politician. Don’t mind him. Are you scared of elections, sir? Campaign. Go ahead and campaign. Organize meetings. People here shudder at the thought about voting No one here in this constituency is going to vote against me. That’s settled then. Your courage is commendable and so let him put all his efforts. Elections here are being conducted after 30 years. It’s only an election in name. No matter what happens, the victory is mine. Who said otherwise? Please win, sir. Wins and losses are not important to me. What matters to me is the polls being conducted. Mr. Raghavaiah, please start. Applause... Applause... Applause. Mr. Raghavaiah, congrats Your election symbol 'lamp'.. He started the campaign by lighting it himself You are unstoppable You are super, sir! Let’s go. Sir, I have a small request. It’s not really such a big deal but it’s related to my family. Your fellow here is looking at me like he wants to kill me. Please get him married, sir. Please, sir. I cannot take that look in his eyes. Okay, bro. You get busy with that. Okay? Lusty, bro! Damn lusty! Sir... can you please give me a pen once Here The elections are taking place after 30 years. Go ahead and campaign..Organise your meetings. I have no objections The newly appointed collector is doing a good job. All the best! Rajappa agreed to the elections? What’s this? Rajappa agreed to the elections?! Did Rajappa agree to the election?! Rajappa agreed to the elections? Mother, apparently Rajappa agreed to the elections. Rajappa spoke of elections. Looks like Macharla is headed for good days. What did brother Rajappa say and what are we looking at here? If anyone looks at this, they would feel like casting their vote. Namaste. What happened? What brings all the elders and esteemed people here? We began to believe that Macharla is going to be facing elections for the first time after a verRaghavaiah. All because of this collector sir But you are quite brave, Mr. Raghavaiah. You have revolted against Rajappa’s rule. From today onwards, we are going to walk with you in this fight. That’s great news. Come...come [slogans] [slogans] I promise you... I will bring change in Macherla [slogans] Narendra. Tell me, Surendra. Whatever be the case, your son is truly great. He’s managed to bring movement back into a dead snake. Look at those people... look at this sort of publicity. I never imagined such day would come. Narender. Tell me, Surender. I was the one who called you. Cunning crook! What Gurnatham? You are Graham Bell and he is a calling bell. You keep calling each other Narender and Surender. No one cares about how frustrated I am. What happened? Your son hit me and I came for an apology. Instead of apologizing to me, he just keeps escaping from my clutches. At any cost, I am going to get an apology from him. If I don’t get it tomorrow, I am going to leave this village and go back home. That is when you will know my worth. You are using a golden piggy bank for chump change. Surender and Narender. It’s Muqaddar ka Sikandar here. Smasher.. Brahmastra Crazy fellow! There’s movement in everyone around. But there’s no movement to be seen in some people. I don’t understand if I should feel happy for the fact that I have become even more popular Or if I should feel sad for the fact that the girl I am interested in is not reciprocating my fe Lassie is awesome! She is the eighth wonder. Her eyes shine like floodlights. She is out to steal my heart with her looks. She is a cutie thunder! Her figure is raunchy. In the middle of the streets, she smiles at me and kills me a thousand times. You are fairer than the milk. shall I make a move on you? If you agree to a date, I'll hop on a flight immediately. This climate is really cool. and the heart is playing a tune, so let's not waste another moment and dance on a duet. Bravo!

I don't want even an inch of gap between us and experience sleepless nights with you. Get the Google map along, before the calendar turns a page, I'll fly you around for a world trip. Baby, please say yes! Bravo! Amidst thudding applause and appreciation, shall I mesmerize your life, girl? Bravo! Amidst thudding applause and appreciation, shall I mesmerize your life, girl?

People will queue for another ticket. Rock it, my dear. Your moves should set the dance floor on fire! Bravo! Amidst thudding applause and appreciation, shall I mesmerize your life, girl? Bravo! Amidst thudding applause and appreciation, shall I mesmerize your life, girl? Seeing that old man wave a flag around amidst all those people is infusing them with vigor, brot Your father is silent. But if we continue to stay silent, it’s going to be difficult for us, brother. Raghavaiah come out. Remove them Remove them all Brother, there is no one inside. Where is he?! They went outside, sir. What did you learn at school today? She is the wife of a deceased collector All the signs are done... send the file Okay sir. What happened? They...they...they are trying to kill us. Who is it? Please save us Veera! You come here. Please get out of that way. Boss, she is running away Sir, no Sir! We have started an investigation sir. Why investigation.. we all know who the killer is Evidence sir Why are you procrastinating for evidence? Sir! No one complains against them No one will testify against them If we file a case, how can we prove it? I believe them Send the dead body for postmortem I’ve only known him for ten days And yet, he is still alive in my eyes. All his life, he worked only for you. And someone like him was killed right in front of your eyes. Don’t you really have even a bit of feeling towards this? Veera’s anger marched into your office. Tomorrow, it’s going to enter your life. Something like this is going to happen to your wife or your daughter right in front of your eyes Are you going to just keep staring and doing nothing even then? All these days I thought you were not courageous. But there is no human being inside you! Sir! Somebody came to see you, sir. Send him in Namaste, sir. My name is Ravinder. I am an out-sourcing employee at the Macharla MRO’s office. Mr. Murthy was the one who helped me secure that job. I was there when the incident occurred, sir. Sir, I have the evidence as well. You said that people won’t file a complaint against them and give evidence as a witness. Here is the evidence. He should not be outside File the FIR. This is my order. Sir! You are making a mistake. You are making a mistake. Buddy, I'm on my way. Hello? -You are coming here during the elections, aren't you? Yeah, Uncle. I'll be there. For sure. Yes, Uncle. We are leaving tonight itself. Raghavayya is enjoying massive backing from the voters! The administrative officer's following among the youth is changing the face of politics. Sir is coming Hello, Sir! Good morning, sir! Sir, we are working in different locations and would meet each other only during the celebrationl but this time we came here to decide the fate of our future. We have total faith in you, sir. Sir, what should we do to ensure the smooth conduct of the election process? We believe that the vote we cast will change our future, for better. Vote for change! Hope for t Vote for the change! Hope for the future! Yes, sir! Vote for the change! Hope for the future! "Vote is your right", says the Collector. Lay the red carpet at every polling booth. -Why, sir? Not for the ones who will win the poll but for the ones who make them victorious. Brother, tomorrow we have the elections. The administrative officer did what he claimed to do! He filled the people with courage, he gathered all the voters of the town from various places. We have waited for far too long, brother. It's time to show him the power of Rajappa. Beef up the security at every booth. -Okay, sir. Hello. -Sir, Rajappa is planning to disrupt the elections. I underestimated you. Not only the people in the town, but you have also made an impact on my loyalists as well. A 30-year-old young chap wants to counter the 30-year-old fear that I've cast on this town. Wait until my reaction, you will remember it for the next 30 years of your life. There won't be a single vote that would be cast in this Macherla until this Rajappa is alive. If that happens, that means, Rajappa is not alive anymore. I won't spare you nor those who have placed their beliefs over you. smother the trust that they have in you. I'll kill the hope that you have given them. Hello? -Swati, where are you? I'm near Durganagar temple. What happened? Where is grandpa? -He is with me. Okay, stay right there. I'm sending the police force. -Hello? Siddu? Hello? -Sir! Veera has escaped. Sir! Veera has escaped. What happened? Are you stressed out? How did you think that I would kill Raghavayya? 30 years ago I did the same thing, if I repeat it people won't fear this time, they would instead sympathise. I already gave you a clue but you didn't understand that. I'd kill the ones who came for you. I'd kill the ones who trusted you. I'd kill the hope that you have given to them. Hope you understand. Something is happening. Something is happening. What is that message? The same thing that our boys forward, "Vote for change, Hope for future". I'd kill the ones who came for you. I'd kill the ones who trusted you. Hope for future! Hope you understand. We have total faith in you, sir. Hope for future! Oh, shit! We believe that the vote we cast will change our future, for better. Do you think you can make the people cast their vote? How dare you? Vote for change? Vote for future? We came here to decide the fate of our future, sir. Sir, what should we do to ensure the smooth conduct of the election process? Yes, Sir! Vote for the change, Hope for the future! You came to cast your vote but you lost your life, my dear son! When you were away, I would hope that you would visit me someday but now, whom should I await fo The same thing happened 30 years ago. Not just one or two, they killed one person from each Zone and turned the entire constituency in For the election that comes once in five years, they have lost the children who should have been with them for another fifty years. Our lives won't ever change! Enough has been done already, stop it now. We are happy to have at least a life to lead. Nobody will turn up to vote after witnessing these Please, go away from here. We are sitting here for no particular reason. I don't think anyone will cast their vote after what they have witnessed. No one will come to cast their vote. We have to wait for another 3 hours and then we can happily leave for our houses. Nobody will turn up! Why did you come here? -I'm here to cast my vote. You will be killed if you cast your vote. Rajappa is done. I will cast my vote. Hey, old man! What are you doing here? -I'm here to cast my vote, sir. You will be killed if you cast your vote. The Collector thrashed Rajappa and is dragging him away. Why would I be afraid? Let's run... let's vote What happened to your tall claims of conducting elections, filing nominations, and making people cast their votes? Did they vote already? Hello, collector! Shall we cast our votes? Are you okay with us voting or do you want the dead boys to come alive and cast their votes? Hey, you can do whatever you want but you can't wipe off the fear that we have created in the hele. I'm Rajappa's son, I have not only inherited his looks but also his sense of politics. Until the fear that we have created exists in people, there won't be a single person who would c In this situation, I should kill you right here and right now. But after listening to you, I feel, I should use you to deliver justice. This is collector Siddharth speaking. The voting in Macherla has begun. If you have voters in your house, come out along with them and cast your votes. I have thrashed Rajappa and dragged him here along with me. What happened? Are you shocked to see him? He is your son! I wiped off the fear that you created using you. Do you know why he is standing in your place? You are a contest, the elections will come to a halt with your death. I want the elections to be held. Didn't I tell you already that you may win if you appease the voters? But instead of asking the voters to vote for you, you have opted for politics with their dead bo What did you say? That there won't be a single vote that would be cast in Macherla until Rajappa The vote has been cast. The polling has been completed. You know the result. The one who will garner people's support only will become their leader. Rajappa has lost his deposit votes. After 30 years, Raghavayya has won with a thumping majority.
