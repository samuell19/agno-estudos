On the U.S. dollar, you have an eye, you have all the stuff. In one place it says "Anus coeptis." Not the anus, there as you... ...you lay your little babies. Not yet in fact... But well... "The anus" just means something in Latin, it means "new era, new creation, new world order." That is something very relevant. If we do one plus one equal... In any case, no... I would just like to hear something. -One plus one equals two? -No, it could be three too. A man and a woman... That is three, you know? In fact, they entered on... on the mechanical stages. That is why it is like impossible. Because they really went right in on the floor that it was the elevators' mechanics and all. How do you want to, scientifically speaking, put a human then say, "Fuck, I am going to go on 6-10ft, "of difference on a building of I don't know how many feet? "We are not dumb here." It would be fun to do shrooms soon. Tom had some on the weekend. He told me it was the best ecstasy he ever had. For sure. It must be crazy, seriously. I heard you have to do it with someone you know well. I wonder if we know each other well enough. Right there. What's up? I think we know each other pretty well. We are friends, best friends and... co-workers. Co-workers? What? It is true. No, no I know. It is just the way you said it. I... I feel close to you. Would you be willing to be fuck buddies, too? You have never had sex, you little prick. That is the point. I would like to do it. With someone I know, like you. Not before marriage. No, no. Just kidding. Damn, you have such a baby face. Do you think so? A little baby face... Does that bother you, or...? No, I think it is cute. I wouldn't feel like I was being taken advantage of by a jerk who just wants to fuck me. Respect is important. Fuck, yes. Hello. I... I noticed that your lawn was high. I mow in the neighborhood, Would you like me to mow your lawn? It doesn't make any fucking sense. She is way too drunk. It is 14:00. She needs to stop drinking. -Shut up, Little Max. -What is up with you? Well no but... She is fine. She is... is in a mood. She is fine. She is in a mood! If the police come by there is not a fucking beer opened. You are so fucking paranoid. Hey. The police aren't going to do anything. Calm down. Anyway. I am taking her home. That is what I am doing. You are a pain. Jen, look at me. Jen, open your eyes. Fine. She can't open her eyes. "Open your eyes." She's fucking drunk. Yeah, good. Look, dammit. She is smiling. She is fine. Wanna another beer, Jen? Are you fucking dumb? No, you are fucking dumb. I wouldn't have given her one. You never know with you. "No, you never know with you." -I want another one. -Yes, give me one. Yes, she looks fine. Very fine, apart from that. She looks like my aunt, at Christmas, dammit. Hey, Little Max, wanna another one? -No, no. -Stop joking. -Your thing. -Catch. Catch! Shit! Dammit, dexterity is not your forte. Hey, do I look like a baseball player? You are more of a cross-country player. Yes, you are a real Terry Fox. Exactly like you. Hey, fuck you, assholes. Let's say I have been useless. Oh yes? You have been useless? Yes, I am... I am quite useless. Oh yes, you are useless. It is fine. We are useless together. Hey... The other day I caught my brother wanking. Seriously. It was disgusting. -No. -He looked really dumb. You look like a fucking clown watching your brother wank. I didn't watch. I saw him wank... I opened the door and there he was. I closed the door. I started laughing. Laughing? You laugh at everything. It is never funny when you laugh. Alright, dammit. But at least he is healthy. Let's say, when I don't have a girlfriend, I can wank... ...twice a day. Once in the morning, once in the evening... A little back and forth, morning and evening. I don't really have the need to wank anymore. You are a dirty fucker, aren't you? A really dirty fucker. Chris' routine. Speaking of the little brother. -Did you get caught wanking? -Fuck you, man! Your thing took a long time? Fuck you. -No, fuck you. -Don't fuck with me. It's over there. You know the kind of apartments at the end? -Yes, yes. -Turn around. -What? -Turn. Oh, shit. -Stop. I can do it. -Open up... Go on. Give him the whole bag. He'll give you $60. -Can you do that? -Yes, yes. -How much are you paying me? -15, as usual. -15. -That is what I usually give you. -Yes. -OK, fine, $20 in weed. Is that OK? Did you fuck her? What is her name? -Shut up. -What is her name? -I didn't... -You didn't fuck her? -Not yet. -Not yet? -Do you have any shrooms? -What? -Shrooms. Mushrooms, dammit. -No, I don't have any shrooms. We are leaving... Going to the woods. No, wait. Who is she? -Who, the girl? -Yes. -I feel sick. -Come on, eat! I don't know. Chris brought her. I think it is... Jen or something. Go take the fucking... Fuck you. -Come on! -We will get there. -I am sick of dragging you around. -Come on. One... Go! No, wait. We are going to use strategy here. -Shit. -You can't help yourself, can you? Shut up. Stop fucking laughing. You make me laugh. Or otherwise... Are you alright? Come on, you faggots! There is no godamm handle on your chair. There is no handle! -Come on. -Dammit, push! Fuck. Here you go, motherfucker. We will get it, we will get it. -Fuck. -We are getting there. Fuck. Give me... -Give me some... -That is left. You are fucking nice. -Hey, shit. -That was dumb. You fucking broke one earlier. Yes, it is you, right? He said it. Bastard. It is a nice combination of the two jerks here. You are such a pain when you do that. I am gonna fuck him a bit... Teach him a lesson. Get off me, you fucking faggot. My girlfriend is too fucking drunk. I need to find release in some way. Yes, let's say you didn't have Jen. Would you take Little Max? On a deserted island. Let's say you are. Have you ever touched his hair? You are so fucking naughty. Stop it. Plus with your chair. It turns me on. For sure his mom washes his hair. With your little tattoo... Everything you have. It would be a good little... -I am starting to feel uncomfortable. -Hey, get off me, you fucking badboy. Yes... Hey... I would take another one, for real. Well that is what I just realized. -Where the hell did you put it. -I put it in the bag. Shit... It is not in the bag? Hey, I am tired, guys. -It is me all the time... -Fucking idiot. Why am I the fucking idiot? I was the one who went to buy it. You forgot it. I will go get some more. Why are you frustrated, faggot? Fucking faggot. If I were you, I would keep my mouth shut. You are so not in a position to bother anyone. Don't get angry. As soon as something happens, you yell at me, you fucking faggot. So you are still frustrated? Right, fucking gangsta? Will you shut the fuck up? You are a dirty fucker, aren't you. For real, you are a fucker with me. -All the time like this... -Will you shut the fuck up? OK, calm down. What is your fucking problem? What's yours? Why the fuck are you mad at me? -I am not angry. -You are all the time, like: "Blah, blah, blah, blah, Little Max to carry, blah, blah!" What the fuck are you doing with me all the time? Why do you take me everywhere? Are you being a hypocrite in front of everyone? You think it is funny? Do you think that is nice? What are you doing? What the fuck am I doing? What are you doing? -I will shut you up. -Hey get off me, man! What are you doing? What are you going to do? Will you get the hell out? -What are you doing, man? -Go ahead, go away. Not turning so well, right? What is your problem? We are not there, what do you do? What is it if we are not there? What do you do if we are not there? Get off me, man! Absolutely nothing, OK. Stop! Go on. What the fuck are you going to do? Let go of me! What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? -Look at me! -Get off me, you bastard! Look at me, damn it! -What are you doing? -I am not going to do anything. What the fuck? Let go of me! Cowards... Get out! Bastard. Let go of me! Let go... Stop it! Hey! OK! Stop! Is that clear? Is that clear? Stop it! OK? Shit! Are you OK, Little Max? Are you sure you are OK? Come here. Shit. What are you doing? The same as you. Yes, Camille is the... the girl who follows you all the time? The girl with brown hair? She doesn't follow me all the time, she is my girlfriend. -She is your girlfriend? -Yes. Oh yes? OK. -Since when? -Well, since earlier. Since earlier? What do you mean? Let's say that... Let's say we got laid. -"Let's say we got laid?" -Well, we got laid. There is no "let's say". Yes, I have no more hymen. Have you lost your penis hymen? Where did you do it? The river. Shut up. You didn't do it at the river. -I swear. -You are so bad. -I swear. -You are naughty. I swear. You are the fucking worst. The river. Fuck you, the river. No worse place than that. Hey, fuck you. It is a fucking beautiful place. Yes... OK. -A sip. -Yes, yes. You are disgusting. -Fuck you. -Fuck. Seriously? -Come. -What are you going to do? -Come, come. -What? Come here, come here. Ouch, fuck. Come. What, are you afraid? Are you afraid? You are a pain in the ass. OK, OK, fine, fine. Calm down, calm down, calm down. It is fine, it is fine. Get up. -You alright? -I am fine. You? Yes, I am fine. Sorry. Fucking shit. Come on. Oh, your little sister. I can't wait for her to get old. You are so fucking naughty. Park yourself. Like a man. Hey, Little Max. That is... That is it. I bought this in a bike store at one point but it has been a while. It has been several years and... it was a... ...a reward. For good grades and all that. So... I said, "Go ahead. We will pick this together." He said: "No, I want to pick it on my own." I said: "OK, go ahead and choose... go ahead and choose... "not the most expensive... "because with the budget and all that." So... He leaves. I am in another row because I also need to check my own bike. All of a sudden I hear: "Dad, I found it, I found it!" I say: "It isn't the most expensive." He answers: "No, the most beautiful." A first bike is important. Would you like to try it? Yes. Would you like to try it? It is for me. -Are you together? -No. It is a goo bike. -Watch out. -Yes. -Are you OK? -What? -Are you OK? -Yeah. Are you sure you are alright? Yes, yes. Good... -Nice bike. -Yes, it is good. It is good? -It is good? -Yes, It is good. Do you like it? -Uh, yes. -Do you like it? So... I give it to you. -No. -I give it to you. For real? Well, thanks. Yes, thanks. Try it. -That is right. -Is there someone waiting for you? What is all this? FIVE YEARS LATER Go through the front instead. rake... -I don't fuck these days. -These days? It is not like you are screwing around. You haven't had a girlfriend in two years. The guy is talking shit, unbelievable. Is there anything I didn't take? I think you are a ladies' man. The only thing is that women don't know it yet. Come on. Nothing serious about it. It can happen to anyone. Honestly, the big tips, Love Guru? What, have you experienced this? Personally... I am the exception that proves the rule. In your minds, I have never had sex in my life? Well, no. Honestly, it is a tough neighborhood. It is normal you don't find much. That is right. Unless your name is Chris, the exception that proves the rule. I am tired of waiting for someone to say "yes." I am tired of going to bars and buying drinks. Of spending my whole fucking paycheck there... Nothing happens. There is never anything. Yes, you are finished, I think. You didn't even start. That is the worst part. Didier does not dip his dick anywhere either and he does not complain. -True, he doesn't complain. -You don't know my life. But I don't think you're finished. Yes. I think you are more... You have a self-confidence problem. Do you know what that means? -Yes. -I am being very serious here, OK? Don't mess around with this stuff. At our age you can't, it doesn't work like that. Do you think I have a disease? No, not that bad. But... More in the field of the syndrome... It happens to everyone. It's OK. If I were you, I would be worried. Sure as hell, a great syndrome! Look. Go with the thought that: You are young, OK? And you can learn a lot more. You still have things to experience. The rejection you are experiencing right now is part of a process. -Your process, actually. -The process of rejection. What are you talking about, the process? The process of... of self-acceptance. Acceptance of what? What are you talking about? Yo... it is getting to be time for you to understand because this is the first step in the process of like healing from your shit. Shut the fuck up. You are spouting shit right now. You are talking nonsense. -OK, let's get started. -Honestly, it came out wrong. I swear. I just wanted to help. I will go sit down. I am sorry, I have got it all wrong. He seems to be something, your neighbor. Tony. When he goes home, you almost have to wash your feet when you go in. Tony, Tony, Tony! Tony has a fucking problem. He is a fucking upstart. He is Greek, and he has a lot of trouble fitting in, he is always picking up his fucking leaves. He is going crazy about his leaves. Yes, he must be OCD. Something like that. OCD... I will give you OCD. Shall we go in? Don't want to finish your cigarette. 30ft, 6ft in... I don't care? Alright. -How are you? -Fine. Are we ready? Well, I am pretty sure we are... But like I said... ...I don't want to get involved. Yes. No, I get it. But I want the guys to be OK with it. Yes. -Have you spoken to them? -Yes. So they understand the plan? Well, I am pretty sure they do. OK. I have been thinking about this for a long time. Yeah. -You know that, right? -Yes. Are you on a job today? Yeah. Damn, that is funny. We keep teasing your brother. Oh yes? For fun. Chris gives him advice on girls. My brother is a good guy. -Oh yes. -He works hard. Yes, yes, for sure. Anyway. I have a few things to do first, but... I can count on you to get the guys to the spot, right? Can I count on you? Yes. OK? What are you doing? Is the lawn mower OK? -It is fine. -Why haven't you started? -Because it smells good. -Yes, it does. But honestly, guys, it takes too long every time. This is the start of the season. We won't start again. This is the third year we do this. Go. When I say I am coming back, let's start this... you have already started, let's say, in my head. I don't hear lawnmower noises. I don't hear weedeater. You never have a fucking outfit. Are you cold? Is it cold? -It makes me feel good. -Yes, it does you good. It looks good on you, but take your shirt off. And we work, no shirt. The four of us are the same. This is the look. I bought the logo. -Take off your shirt. -I am. You must realize we are weeding, mowing the lawn. We can calm down, too. Yes, but someone is paying for it. If we don't do it right, someone else will come along. Is there anyone who has complained that much right now? It is not about complaining, it is about doing the job right. We just want to do it right, and right now, we are just doing... -We are not doing the job right. -You are not doing anything. What are you doing? Where is the weedeater? Did he leave? I said get started. You were talking about couples, sex, dicks. I don't care what we talk about. That's OK, that's not the point. It is nice to talk while working. But while working. OK, we will talk while working. That is it. I hate to tell you guys this, as we are friends. We hate it too. OK, guys, come on. Group hug! What? Fuck, come on, give me a hug. -All together? -All together. -Stop. You have a hard-on already. -No. -Great joke. -Big day, guys. -I will be back. -Shit... This is for you. Thanks. Thanks. Slick, slick. Smoke a doobie? To roll.. a joint, man? -No, man, I don't have time. -No? Are you sure, man? OK. OK. Hey man, yesterday I saw... Have you ever seen La Haine? I saw it again yesterday. It is my favorite movie. Man, have you seen it? No. Have you not seen it? Have you not seen La Haine? You know, about tonight... Basically, I don't want to stress you out. You know, girls... I saw you once in a bar... You have to understand something. It is very important, when you are there in the bar, the girls, if you make eye contact with them, you don't have two chances. I have seen you, often you stay a bit like... You are like: "Shit, but no, I can't..." Man, you are the one with the balls. You are the dick. Show it. You express it in your eyes, in your mouth, in your hair. It is important to be subtle with girls. They sense it, right? They sense it. They are totally receptive to these things. Pheromones are created. I can offer you my services. It would be a bit like... Kind of like Dumbledore did with Harry Potter, for the first six books because after that, he pulls his dick out. I train you, but without you realizing it, really. Subtilement, Subtly, with life experiences. It is a good plan, right? I will be back. Have you changed soap? Yes. My aunt bought me a new one. -It smells good, anyway. -Yes. What's up? Don't you like it? When you are 25 years old and don't buy your own soap... Stop it. I would love it if someone bought my soap. What about you? Your guy in the ER? Do you still see him? My George Clooney? No. No. He was too busy. He didn't buy me soap. I will buy you some soap. Oh yes? What kind? Well you know, not like the fucking cheapskate flowers. Or the little things that don't smell right. You would be more like... green tea. You know, so you could be... ...a smell, then a taste. -Yes? -The whole kit. What about you, handsome? You are more what? Well, I... I am more like... Ginger. That is for sure. But for real, it is not always easy. What's that? Well, you know... Meeting people, girls, all that. It is not easy for anyone. OK... Yes. No, it is a joke. It is very beautiful. He is a jerk. -A pool, really. -Yes, yes, yes. The life of the rich and famous. I took your drinks. I don't have any ice cream, it is a little hot. The first one is a bit hard, after that it is OK. It depends... I think he is the strong one. Cheers. -Cheers. -Beautiful life. -Hey, it is nice here. -Thanks. -What do you call a baby bird? -A nestling. How do you spell it? N-E-S... No. -Wasn't that right? -N-E-S-T-L-I-N-G. I have a friend who thought it was nesling: N-E-S-L... I think he wanted to write a poem. He wrote nestling with S-L. No T. After he went to check. He wrote that on Google. He said: "Hey, not worth a damn in Scrabble." That was the first definition he came up with. -For real? Because it doesn't exist? -It is a word that does not exist. He said: "So nestling doesn't exist, "it is not baby bird." -But it is in the dictionary. -Shut up! Yes but with a T! Not N-E-S-L. What an idiot. He was nestling... -Was the poem for you? -I am tired, I think... I never read it. So you, do you have a girlfriend? -No I don't have a girlfriend. -No? No time for that. Didier, seriously, is a sleeping animal. I have seen him sometimes with girls... There were fucking things, it went in... Yes, it was non-stop. On the go, as they say. But it is scary. Honestly, it is scary. It is not that scary. At some point there is your fear, and your fear. When was your last one? A long time ago! Once upon a time! -Oh yes, OK, once upon a time. -Uh, well... -Yes, yes, yes. -Yes, it is fine. It is fine. -So you, your summer? -Great, great summer. -Fuck. -Well yes, but... Wait, I will help you. You are in the wrong hole. Wait a minute. Hello. You fool. Wait, I will help you. Stop it. I know you like it. The comedy world, I sure don't hate it. You are all set. Shall I put you back in your chair? On my throne. No, I think I will stay here for a while. Yes? Sure you don't want help? Little Max? No, I can go on my chair by myself. But... There are other things I'm getting tired of doing on my own. Oh, yes? But... I will tell you a story. I have a friend named Richard, OK? OK. And then... You know Richard, at some point, he left. He went on a road trip. But just to let you know, Richard, before he left, he was a nice guy but he was the kind of guy who didn't go to school for long. He only went up to junior high. OK. He goes on a road trip to the United States, somewhere in Vermont, around there. At some point, a nice quiet evening. He goes to a bar. Has one beer, two beers. And then Richard spots a girl. The girl comes, he starts chatting to her. He told me about her, not her hair color, nothing, but he said she was a beautiful girl. So you can imagine. The beautiful girl starts talking to Richard. Richard, all worked up. At one point, the girl tells him she is staying across the bar, you know... Richard is smart enough, he goes. He tells me a bit about what happened. Bang, bang, all that. Up all night. But the thing is... It is that Richard, Richard doesn't have a fucking tooth in his mouth. On top of that, he can't write, that bastard. Come on, shit! You know? He fucked her, he doesn't even have a tooth. You get it? Well... No, wait. You know, we don't have to do everything but... ...maybe we could do a little something. It is good. Nice. Thanks. It is... It is smart. What do you do in life? Not bad just that. -Oh, the outfielders. -Yes, that is us. Great. -I bit you. -No. Yes. You have beautiful hair. Wait. No, I know but it is always tiring when they are like that and then we have sex. It sucks. The strands of hair in your mouth. Yes, it is better now. Do you like this better? You never said... Ouch, damn. My shoulder... Wait. I am in too much pain. I don't know if it is that or... No, don't move, don't move. It is fine, it is fine. -Are you OK? -Yes. I am not that strong sometimes. -Can we kiss? -Yes. Kiss? I have, uh... I don't know how... how to start this. Seriously, I really like... I really like making love to you, OK? What are you saying? I have... I am tired of lying to you. I just want you to understand after this chat that: if I tell you this it is because I trust you. OK, no that is beautiful. You must understand. It is fine, I think that... We told each other. You understand, like, what state I am in too. Let's stay... friends? -That fucked up. -Well... A man doesn't say things like that. Why? Do you think girls say it more often? I don't know. In human perception, in general, people. Let's stop here. Let's not debate gender roles. I am just afraid of, like... Like, good friends who have already made love to each other. -A classic. -For now. I don't know about the future. Summer is not long, you know... I am talking shit. It is fine. In the fall, I will go on a trip. You will forget about me. It is true, too. I wanted to come join you, but... -No. -I have to go to work. Yes, work. You have to eat. What? Nothing. It is just... It looks like there is something wrong. No, I am fine. Where is Chris? Who cares about Chris? He is inside with Julie. It makes sense. Can I have a sip of beer? Funny, that. Thanks. -What's up? -Nothing. I... I don't know... Are you embarrassed? Yes, I am not used to doing that. To... kissing? Yes. Well, have you ever kissed a girl? No, never. But, yet... What? Well... You look like a good kisser. Smart. But you don't lose anything by trying. Think of it as a game. You lost the game... So, I can do what I want. I lost? No worse. So... I had such a weird dream. What? I dreamed that I was killed, but not like... Not shot by a guy... It was very strange. It was like, local guys... who were cutting my throat. Very violent. I like got up on the defensive. I realize I get up like this every morning. Yet I have nothing to be guilty about. Anyway... ...not yet. I am fucking bored. I am so fucking bored. Honestly... I don't feel like waking up one morning and realizing that I am just like everyone else, ordinary... wondering why the sky is blue. Why is the sky blue? The... the sky is blue because it is... it is as blue as you are you. It doesn't know why it is blue. Who cares? The only thing that I know is that your girls... ...they won't take you any further. I am telling you. -It is better to work. -What, dammit? You want to end up in jail, right? It would be nothing compared to here. Would you rather be in jail than here? Is that what you are saying? What the fuck are you thinking? The people in prison are very ordinary. I can tell you that, OK. About the throat slitting... ...I think you can stop worrying. Maybe besides me, but I am really the only person. Seriously, it is still very hard, what he asked us to do. Sure you want to do this? No choice. Does it bother you when I talk about others you don't know? I am just, like, intrigued. It bothers you. Tell the truth. No I just want to see her. It is not a good idea to trust me. What are you talking about? In five, four, three, two, one... Fuck. Seriously, the plan is not to stand for five minutes in front of the house we'll burgle. Now all you have to do is put on your fucking hood. -Then do what we have to do. -OK! Fine! -OK, wait for me. -Yes, yes. We leave no one behind. Let's go! The sooner it is done, the sooner we have money. Oh, shit. A good cake. Don't you want the cake? Will your fucking cake wank me? No... We can ask it. I was two inches away from being wanked! -By the girl upstairs? -Well, who the fuck do you think? Why didn't you get wanked by the girl upstairs? Because you came in like a fucking clown! I have been at this for two weeks! I stopped you getting wanked with my cake ? Hey, sorry. I bought you this for your birthday. You can get wanked another time. A small bite. Hey, fuck you with your fucking shit cake. I don't fucking care about your birthday! I fucking wanted to get wanked! OK, fuck. You know how much it cost me to get your name written on the paper? Then you are not fucking happy. It cost nothing but I still had to ask the lady. Fuck you with your fucking shit cake. Do you want another gift? I am going to give you another gift, OK? You are such an idiot sometimes. No, fuck that. I am spoiling you. -What are you going to do? -Give you many gifts. Check this out. I will give you a miracle, my friend. You are so dumb. Come. Come, the miracle! Hey, what the hell? Hey, look, everyone! He is walking! It is my gift! -He can use his legs again. -OK, put me back. On his birthday! I wanted to use my dick on my birthday, dammit! You are so dumb. You are not going to leave me here? No, I will ask... the girl to come and wank you while taking you upstairs. Hey, you are a real idiot, I tell you. Look, use my legs! I will replace you in your chair. That is my gift to you: we switch. I am going to go fuck upstairs. Be right back. -I will leave you the cake. -You are such a jerk. Show it to me. Show it to me. -What? -Come on, I want to see. Show it to me. 1 YEAR LATER Fuck. Fuck. Rum. Good rum, that. It comes from Panama. It is... It is a good rum, for real. It is old and everything. Give yourself a chance. With the clients, you have to focus. It is you, then them. You, them. There must be nothing that bothers you. To be with you, that is what gives me the focus. When you sell something, unless you are fun... People can feel it. There is a doubt, you know? Some will sign anyway, for sure, but they won't trust. Then that complicates things. Hey, sometimes, man, it is hard to talk to them, zero. They don't want to buy. But... if you insist... ...and you insist in the right way... ...it works. Normally, you would be able to make money on that half-eaten pizza. Search me why, but someone here will buy it from you. Try it. -What? -Yes. -Hello. How are you? -Fine. But I didn't order a pizza. 1048... Didn't you order an extra large one? It is called the tasty one. It is really the best one they do, that we do. You ordered it. How much did you pay for it? I don't know. $24 with both liquors? And? Did you order pizza? Extra cheese. Extra cheese? Tell them you let them have it for $20. Are you giving it to me? Good luck, my friend. Just a nice big pizza, extra cheese, still warm. Have a good day, gorgeous. Uh, it is $20, right? Yes, that is right, $20 flat. No tips. No taxes. Alright. No big deal. It is still warm. -What? -It is still warm. -Cool. Thanks. -Bye. -Go home. -Did he pay? Did he pay? Hell, yes. You didn't work very hard, we hear. Fuck. Hey, relax, buddy. It is just me. Fuck. You can't scare me like that. Shit! How are you going to handle all this? I don't think it is up to me to manage anything. Fate is taking care of that. I know you're not really interested but eventually you will have to... You will have to. Fate. It is a long time since it came to see me. You will have to... I don't think I want to think about all this stuff right now: a job, everything... I am just not there. That is your little fucking generation. You think you can choose what is more and what is less important and when. I manage to give myself a break sometimes, you know. It is not chance that aligns itself on one side or the other. I make sure I am in the right place because I know what pisses me off. Of course, it is not pleasant, having to make decisions but eventually... ...it looks like we are filling our heads with problems. Because we are too dumb to... or too naive, or ambitious, perhaps. But eventually, you have to end of your bullshit. Then fill your head with solutions. Yeah. I know you do it, but... You just have to remember you are the boss. I am the boss. -Are you the boss or not? -The boss of what? "The boss of what?" Fuck. The boss of you, my man. The boss of you, fuck. Probably. For sure. Not "probably." For sure. Definitely. DOORS AND WINDOWS My darling. How are you? Hey, it smells nice. Hey, I talked to your mom last week. Something. You alright? I think we should stop seeing each other. Oh boy. Yes, I would rather that. I am not sure where you are going with this but I think you-- No, no. I thought about it. I am not stupid. It is like you think I am stupid. No. No, I don't think you are stupid. I think you are... ...what you are. A young girl... young woman who wants... ...to assert herself, make decisions on her own, but maybe you're going too far. No, it is not too much. I am not interested in that anymore, Dad. It is not too big, it is not too small. It is... ...it is just the hard truth. No, no. It is too big, it is... It is... No, no. It is too big. It is too big. It is... You cannot It is because what you are saying affects more than you think. These are things that leave a trace... Rose, you can't just say anything, at a certain age... It leaves a trace. I just think there is a certain limit to what I can endure. Our relationship is toxic. No, our relationship is not necessarily toxic. We are in a trough and we are having a hard time getting in line. -It doesn't make sense. -It is true. But there is always something we can do to... I think the best thing to do is... stop seeing each other. No, no, shit, I don't think so... It is the opposite. No, look, see? You think like a child. "I don't want this. I don't want that." It is the opposite. Honestly. You don't have any solutions, basically. You are a guy who... would have liked to live something else... but... Unfortunately, well, you have a 19-year-old daughter and then... ...you have a job that depresses you. I understand you are lost. I get it. But that is no reason to ask me to... ...lower myself to that level. I am not a psychologist. I don't want to think about your problems. Do you get it? Yes. Dad? Oh, it is fine. Forget it. You go to the coldest countries, say Norway, Finland, you name them... all the countries, the old Viking countries it is very cold there, OK? What do they work with? With the Energia. Because that is the window to the future. And if not, what will happen is... Don't you get bored on the road by yourself? No, it is fine. Romain, please take it! For real, I don't get it. What's that? All of it. All that happened. I don't understand what you did. Well, in my opinion, you don't understand how I think. You will never understand, too, how I think. I think you are wrong, you think I am wrong. Both of us even think that the other one... is a bit dumb, you know? At the moment... we have a conflict. So you, you are well... With all that is happened? With how you handled it. You, you are... You are good with it. Well yes, I am fine. Maybe... you think I am not handling it well or that I am handling it badly but I think I am handling my life well. Then honestly... I don't care what you think. I don't care. I create my own reality. Do you get it? In my reality... ...if I decide to win... ...well normaly... ...I win. Yes, but the guys are finished because of it. That is your reality. If I could go back, maybe I would change something. Well I hope you would. But I can't go back. You get it? Even if I could... ...I wouldn't go back. Honestly. Well, I wouldn't! Look where I am now. Given you think you are I don't know who. Yes, that is right. It is crazy, right? It is crazy. It is crazy-crazy. That is right. I don't need you. I don't need anyone. Unless you come into my life, then you listen to me. You let me guide you. I am telling you, I am good at this. You can't do better than me. I found something that works. Things that work are rare. I am telling you, if you work hard, you don't think too much... -And you act. You act. -It is beautiful, it is beautiful. You will be able to see far ahead of you as well as you see what is directly in front of you... ...just, it will be easy to manage your life. Sure, there'll always be something or someone who will screw up your plan, but... ...you accept it... you just keep going, dammit. Why are you laughing? No, but... But no, but I am not laughing at you. You know what I mean. Eh, boy. How long had we seen each other? Long time, boy. So this is how it works. We come to your house, we install all the... Trust me, you are going to get the best setup. If I have an employee who-- -I am talking to you. -I kick him out. -Romain, I am talking to you! -I don't do this one to everyone. -Are you listening to me now? -Yes. You are not selling doors and windows. You are being a clown. Do you think it is funny to come here? You think it is a party to get up at 6 a.m. and come here. I will tell you that! It is not the party, it is a job. There is no fun at work. We work here. I have been here for 25 years and I have never done this nonsense... That is what keeps the place alive. Do you get it? Can you understand that? That it is the customers. There is nothing funny about it. There is nothing funny about clients, or about this job, OK. Did you ever ask yourself who it is? What's up? My name is Sylvain. Sylvain TrÃ©panier and I am your boss! I think for you here is... a fun party. I am going to tell you something else that is not funny. But not everything? It is that I can kick you out whenever I want. Look, no. You? I am kicking you out, man. Go away. -You are not serious? -I am very serious. Leave right now. I am... firing you for all the shit you do... in this place here since you came in. I... Look, no, I have got plenty in my truck. I don't need to explain myself. Seriously? Yes! Seriously! Serious. Get the hell out of here! Look... go make door jokes at... ...your house, the guy at the diner, I don't know. The fooling around is over. Fuck. For real, you have to talk to him. It is not going well. What is his problem? It can't be. He is crazy, for real. We have to do something. -Yes. -Yes, we have to-- What do I do? I lost my job... -I don't know. -What? You have to talk to him. Say something. Did you see how he... What are you doing? Hey! Huh...? Go out. Leave. Open it! Open it! What are you doing? Bastard! I am so glad to be done. -Well yes, it went by fast. -I was so tired. Thanks. It is a pleasure. Yes, it is about time. Yes, how long did it last in total, exactly? My last work experience was for three months. It went by fast, didn't it? Yes, but you know... university, at some point. -Yes, you are tired. You want-- -Yes, that is it. -Can't wait to move on, right? -Well, yes. You want to get out there and do the real deal. But you know, working with kids. -No, I understand. -That is right. I can't wait. Like... teaching them things. You know, it is silly, but like... ...I will learn from them too. Well, yes. No, I know what you mean. For sure. It is sick. I am really happy. In any case... If you saw them... They are sitting, they are looking at you, they are like... They are pure. You know, like... They are pure. On the last day of my work experience... ...they all made me a big card. Like... with all their hands dipped in gouache. It is adorable. -I am going to go smoke. -OK. -Why are you laughing? -No, no, it is just... Watch out. I just don't want you... to see me as a crook, you know. -Like a loser. -Well no, honestly. All crooked, maybe, but... which makes a lot of sense. Do you get that? Common sense. Can you? I think so. Thanks for the ride! What are you doing here? Came to see people. Yes. You... Are you OK? Big night? Well... Ladies night. You, you OK? Top shape. Honestly. OK... Have you seen people? No, man, there is no one. No one. Here, the beautiful people arrive later. Yes, right? Well. Yessir.
