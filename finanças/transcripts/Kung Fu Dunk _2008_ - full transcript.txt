EMP, Chang -Hong Channel Film & Video, and Shanghai Film Group present. He who controls the rebound, wins t he match... just as he who can throw a left hook dominates the boxing ring. However... slam dunk makes me feel good. Executive Producers: AlbertYeung Sau Sing, Wu Dun, Ren Zhonglun. To a kind -heartedperson. Big Brother, I found this baby by chance. I can only leave him with you. But I feel my fate is connected to this child. Here, count this as his present to you. I can't read. You can read. Please teach him this. "Faltering Universe..." For God's sake! It's "Altering Universe". So it is. He's born for martial arts. Is he? So, please look after him. Goodbye. Jump! Your Lightness Kung Fu has improved a lot! Next time you want to jump, please put some shoes on. The world was divided into Heaven and Earth when "Qian and Kun" were created. Every life form originated from Yin and Yang. All changes in life forms in this world are related to "Qi". Master, I don't get it. Everything in this world is made of tiny particles. "Altering Universe" disassembles those particles, takes everything apart, then rebuilds it. In a split second, time is stopped. You can even turn the clock back. Master. Can anyone help my master? Anyone? Master! My name is Fang Shijie. I grew up in this kung fu school. My master told me I was found next to a basketball court. Now... whenever I hear the sound of a ball thumping, my heartbeat increases. It's not a heart attack. It's because I will see her there. I'm too old for love affairs... But speaking of my love life, it's been very eventful. You see, in my life, there have been three girls who would die for me. When I first discovered love, there was a girl who would have died for me... If you keep stalking me, I'll kill myself. When I was an adolescent, there was a girl who would have waited for me until the next life. Want to be my boyfriend? Maybe in your next life! When I was poor and lonely, there was a girl who would have died with me. If you don't give me the money back... I'll jump from here with you! This is a kung fu school. Sure you can tell that? This is where I grew up. Technically speaking, since my master died from attempting "Altering Universe", I've become increasingly defiant. That's Master Fei and Master Wu. The traditions of Shaolin and Wudang have been passed through the generations. They're the masters of the 88th and the 99th generations of the schools. They are a couple, Master Ni and Master Huang. Oh, right, they were pen pals before. Good day! Headmaster! There is someone else at the school who you should know... He's the so -called "World No. 1 Fist God", our headmaster - Wang Biao. Everyone saw? In the world of martial arts... This is my job... Headmaster's human punchbag. But his fists are so weak, as long as I put on my iron vest, it doesn't hurt at all. How many times have I told you? Never put on the iron vest when I punch you! Here is your punishment: No dinner. And get out! Get out! It's getting late. You're not going home? I'm locked out. Planning to sleep here overnight? Yeah, why not? Of course not! - Why not? - Why not? I can tell you haven't eaten. You can't go to bed on an empty stomach. - I'm not hungry. - I think you are but you have no money. - Here. - No. Thanks. Hey, it's not for you. It's for a bet. If you can throw this coin into my mouth, I'll treat you to dinner. Obviously not from such close range. Not too far either. Here is fine. I'm good, right? French cuisine! Want to eat? - It's so expensive! - So that shows I'm sincere! Come on, we're VIPs. We have a special entrance. Follow me! Wei, Hua and Fa! Cool! You know it's meal time, right? Come on... They're cool! They're on their home turf here. But like me, they don't want to go home. I count myself as their patron. And I have a patron as well. Bao! Dad! My daughter, Bao. Does she look like me? Sadly... she doesn't. She looks like her mum. - I thought you weren't coming today. - Of course I am. We have a guest today. Two set dinners! Hmm... OK. You'll be having escargots as the starter. There are lots left over. And steaks as well. Come on, cheers! A '92 topped with a '94? Wow, Dad, you're so good at tasting wine! It's mixed with '92, '94 and '96. Leftovers from 3 tables. People choose a wine by the year, but I go for the whole decade! All the best wines of the '90s! Try some escargots. Take your time. I need to check if the customers have left. Come on, cheers! Here's to our grand plan! Cheers. - What grand plan? - Two swords in one. Your athletic potential and my brainpower. Look at the colour of it, isn't it great? It tastes even better. Almost the best whiskey of the 21st century. Try it. It tastes really good. Of course! It's more than 1,000 dollars cheaper than the real thing. But the guests can never tell what's good or bad. Pricey booze is always good. Brother Hu, some idiot wants to bet on darts! 200 dollars for a round! You know, I never lose in a darts game. If we fill the bottles with the fake whiskey, no one will ever know. How about 70% for me and 30% for you? OK? Brother Hu, can I have another 200 dollars? How is this possible? You never lose! I'll definitely win this time. I'm being very fair... One for you, another one for me... One for me, one for me again and another one for you... I was wondering who your champion was! Hu! I forgot we were on your turf! Let's pretend it never happened... All right? You stole my money and now you're giving it back to me. What does this mean? Do you remember I was a good friend of your dad's? I held you in my arms and you peed on me... Jie, come on, don't forget we need to meet someone. You can have ice cream somewhere else!

The price of gold is going up. It's worth more than 10 million. It's all yours. Last night, a student of ours was making trouble in a nightclub. It's seriously damaged the reputation of our school. I hope he'll come out and admit it. Who did it? Step forward! What have I taught you? A decent man takes responsibility for his actions. Well, I'll count to three. If no one steps forward, I'll expel you all! One! Two! Thanks. It was him! That's enough. It's OK. He's really tough. No... my men are tired. Sure, sure, they must be tired. I'll treat them to dinner tonight. You never learned. Now, you've ruined our reputation. So now, you're expelled! Hey, hey! Ah, I was just about to talk to you. I've done my research... What suits you most is... What's wrong? Can you take me to the club? I want them to pay the price... You think you're Bruce Lee? Forget about that nonsense. Let's do something grand! I can't play football. How about basketball? Come on, throw it into that trash can. Come on, give it a try! Yes! Playing basketball is not just about winning. If he plays in order to find his birth parents, isn't it more touching? His audience have tears in their eyes... They cheer him throughout the match... Won't it make the headlines? Stop it. Abandoned by his parents, he plays basketball in search of them... It'll be a moving, sensational story. Even if he's not winning, the university will still get lots of publicity. Chancellor Zhou, look at him. How innocent! He's not only an obedient son, but a role model for young people. Because he's raised the athletic spirit to a higher level. He's showed us the virtues of Chinese culture. We all know how important parents are to us. Fang will keep playing basketball until he finds his parents. Let us welcome Fang Shijie - the Basketball Orphan who loves his parents so much he'll never stop looking for them. Fang Shijie! Do I have to dress like this? You look cool, come on... Read from the notes. Thank you all for your support. Thanks to... my dear Uncle Li, and the Chancellor. I hope... I can find my parents soon. I'll work hard... Wait a minute! No one can join our team without the captain's permission. Who is she? She's with the basketball team. We do have this tradition. Well, since there are so manyjournalists here, let Jie demonstrate. Come on, no problem. Even the Chancellor has to observe the traditions of the First University. Joining the team requires... They still can't find him... The Captain's name is Ding Wei, 20 years old, 4th grade. As long as he can score once, he'll be admitted... It's still not certain whether Fang Shijie can join the team... Well, miss, getting scared? Hiding isn't a good idea. Is anyone answering? Shall I ask Jie to shoot? He scores every time. Here you are! Someone is waiting for your permission to join the team. He's the captain? How is he going to play if he's drunk? Here he is. Yeah! Shoot! Shoot! Get back, please. Sorry, get back, please. Yes, please, get back. Yeah! Did you read the papers today? A real-life Oliver Twist. Isn't it wonderful? We're going to make a fortune! OK, that's it. Don't worry. OK, bye! What's wrong? What the hell! Such great coverage! It's not right, look... "Basketball Orphan Bullied by Captain." Fantastic headline! Very sensational! - You don't like it? - Stop selling stories to journalists! What do you know about it? You're neither Yao Ming nor Liu Xiang. They don't have to say anything but they'll always be in the headlines! But you're nobody. You know you're nobody? No one will give you any exposure unless you can spice things up. They don't care about you! It's a sensational headline. A story to tell! Ah, I see... You're worried you'll be bullied when others read the story? Well, that's for sure, because you're a genius. People are always jealous of geniuses. It doesn't matter. As long as you're famous! You can have anything when you're famous. That's how things work. Come on, go practise. Come on, be good and go. Captain... I know you're gutted. It's fine if you want to beat me up, I won't fight back. Who said I wanted to beat you up? There is a saying amongst basketball players. "He who controls the rebounds, wins the match." You can jump really high. So you just do one thing in the match - rebound. That's boring! I'm good at shooting. Never miss one. Morning! Why have you stopped? Keep playing! Wow, are you OK, brother? Sure you're not sick? It's too early to show up! I've found a secret weapon. What secret weapon? Brother, your time has come! We'll be the winners at the championship! That's impossible. Top three? Stop dreaming! Then top eight? Possibly. Where's your confidence? There are only 16 teams in total. Come on, shoot! Cool! Hello! I'm Zhen Li, agent of the Basketball Orphan, Fang Shijie. I'd like to send you some photos. Can I have the address? OK, thank you. Xiao Ian! Xiao Ian... can we have your autograph? Can you write my name on as well? Can you take a picture with us? - So excited! - Work hard, Xiao Ian... Hey, this is Jie. He's really good at shooting hoops. - Jie. - Lily. This is Xiao Ian. This is Fang Shijie. He got injured and just came back today. Hello! Lily's mentioned you to me. - She says you're very talented. - Really? But the most important thing is training. Lily also says you lack basic training. So you're saying you can beat him? Try it, if you have the guts. You know who the hero is? It's Jie! Right? Why are you clapping? The journalists are here. Stop clapping. Did you get my point or not? Know who the hero is? - You mean Jie? - Of course! He's new. He should be on the bench for a while. On the damn bench? He's been waiting all day. Come on. What did she say? She said she really wants to see you play. I asked her to wait. I'm warning you, there are only 5 minutes left. - Let Jie play, or I'll call the police. - Put Jie on. ♪ My basketball is beside your feet, You kick it like a football ♪ Hi, nice to meet you. ♪ Then I put it on like I'm wearing a hat unlike people in Antarctica ♪ It is not a random opinion Good souvenir... ♪ My God!

Hello? Jie! Where's the ball? Captain, I've been practising for ages, can you teach me how to slam dunk? Do you want to run before you can walk? Take your time! Is it really that difficult to dunk? I know Lightness Kung Fu... so it can't be that difficult. The First University starting line -up: Captain Ding Wei, Shooting Guard Zhang Gui, Centre Yang Rong, Power Forward Xiao Ian, And the popular "Basketball Orphan"... Haven't seen you before. Are you new? Yeah, nice to meet you. This game is cruel. It's never nice to meet you. Only screaming and whining here. They scream for me, "Oh! You're so cool!" You whine, "Oh! I'm so embarrassed!" It's a cruel world. Jump ball! Fang Shijie takes the ball andpasses to Xiao Ian. Xiao Ian dunks! Fantast ic! This match has attracted mass media attention. Fang's search forhis parents has become the hottest topic. Fang steals the ball andpasses to the captain, Ding. Ding jams it in again! Shame he can't dunk. The ball is passed to Fang and he shoots... It's impossible... But he's scored! Did you see it? He never misses! Crazy! Fang has the ball... He sheds the defence. He looks like Michael Jordan in his prime! Beautiful! Xiao Ian's dunk has really brought the game to a fever pitch! Dunk! Fang Shijie! Slammmmm dunk! Another dunk! Dunk... Dunk... Slam dunk. Dunk... Dunk... Fang's got the ball and the crowd is going wild! Dunk! Dunk! Dunk! Dunk! Fang's going to dunk! Never give your opponent a chance. The mighty guards of the First University... represent the long history and traditions of the First University Basketball Team. Jordan, Kobe and Magic Johnson. At t his moment, their spirits converge in Fang. Fang Shijie is now representing the long history and traditions of the First University Basketball Team. At this moment, he's not fighting alone. He's not on his own. He scored! The almighty First University Basketball Team! Happy Birthday to Fang! Long live Fang! AMAZING! Lone orphan has incredible power. Rising star Fang Shijie scores 36 points. A STAR lS BORN, HE NEVER MISSES Fang can score from anyposition. Come, have some water. Thanks. Tired? Ah, sorry! You played so well! Everyone was watching you. You're the soul of the team. You're terrific! Keep working. Work hard! Championship match against Fire Ball. When suits you? Next March. Then how about 1 .3 million dollars? That's rather expensive. Hello! Yes, yes. I'll arrange the interview for you. OK, no problem. I don't want to be your enemy. I hope you can leave the First University and join us. Who are you? I'll be your opponent the day after tomorrow. We'll be opponents in the Championship the day after tomorrow. That's good. Nice to meet you. I've been watching you for a while. You shoot well, even from a long distance. Shoot! The ball always goes in. But your weakness is that whenever you're distracted, you miss. This is my card. I can help you improve. Captain of the Fire Ball? Yes, that's right. Call me. Think it over. Hello! Long time no see! What're you doing here? I came to see you, to catch up with you. Can't I? Wow! Great! All our old friends are here. See you at the match the day after tomorrow. Hello! What? Big business! That's right, it's me. Hey... His name is Li Tian. He joined our team two years ago. Same as you, he was no good at first. But he was very talented. He picked up everything very quickly, and was soon the captain. But he changed completely after a while. He not only left the team on the eve of the final match but took the bestplayers with him. It must be really hard for you that I'm always on top. Actually, I was "on top" of your girlfriend as well. They were neck and neck in the final. Two seconds left and First University was one point behind. But my brother was going to shoot two free throws. She was good... Yes! My brother was on the brink of a nervous breakdown. From the moment the ball was thrown, everyone knew the result. At that crucial moment, the most fearsome enemy appeared: It was his own trembling hands! After that match, my brother could never get over the trauma. He consoles himself with hard drinking. Don't worry. I won't let Li Tien get away with it. But... I'm worried Uncle Li might sell you out. No way. It's impossible. - Uncle Li... - Jie, don't fall into the trap! If you fight them, you won't be allowed to play the match. You're the dream and ambition of my life. They just didn't get it. How could it be possible for me to sell my dream? Thank you. What for? I'll never sell off my cash cow... but the price was damned tempting... Please, work hard and be successful. Don't let me regret my decision tonight. I won't let you down. I recognise them.

You're bound to lose. - Beautiful! - Good! Replacing? Hey, we've signed the agreement. The agreement is the same as the contract. Of course not! The game isn't finished yet... Hello? Hello? Ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the power cut, the match is abandoned. The committee has decided... Count yourselves lucky! The match will be resumed in three days. But you're going to lose... sooner or later. It doesn't matter when. Take a break. I can't help it if God is on our side... Is this your bad luck or my good fortune? Bye! Let's go! What have you been daydreaming about all afternoon? Nothing. I'm thinking of my parents. It seemed like they were at the match. Did you see them? I could feel them there. It's strange... If they were here, why didn't they come to me first? Yeah, you're right. Still remember me? What? Looking for a fight? Brother Hu. I'm not looking for a fight. The match the other day. I caused the power cut. So, it was you... But why? To be honest, I left Bi Tianhao. I must beat him. So I put a bet on you. - How much? - 5 million US dollars. Jie! Look who's here! - I saw you on TV. You looked cool! - Why are you all here? - Have you found your parents? - No, not yet. Jie, searching for your parents via basketball... That's a good gimmick. It's better than a soap opera. You're in the paper every day. They don't believe I am your master. I guess you must have heard Jie's news on TV... I'm hoping you can do him a favour... Play a kung fu basketball match for him. Jie is our best protégé. His business is our business, right? Yes, sure. As long as it's legal, I was open to anything that would help him. Say thank you to your master. Didn't you hear what he said? He "was" open to anything, "was"... What do you mean? You know Bi Tianhao took over the school. To be honest, for the past few years, we've been serving that bastard Wang Biao. We're absolutely useless. It is a crappy job at the school... But it's my bread and butter. I can't sacrifice it for a useless medal. Hey, the soap opera is starting... Tales from the World of Martial Arts. Hello! Yes, speaking. I don't care which paper you write for. I'm busy! Hey, what's wrong with me? Nothing. It's my problem. I can't accept another woman in my life. Are you crying? Stop crying. Leave me alone. I won't. Am I a nuisance? No way. You're always cheerful... You're... What? Nothing. What? You really want to know? - Yes. - Promise you won't laugh at me. I liked ice cream so much when I was a kid. But I could never have it. So I'd do anything just to get some ice cream. You're just like ice cream... I knew I shouldn't have said it. He should be here soon. Hello? Hello? The battery's dying... Lily: Work hard, Jie. Two cripples and two useless riff-raff, it's five fighting against one. - Hey, Jie. - Master. We changed our mind. We decided to get our hands dirty. They're not students. They're not qualified. Ah, they've been transferred to the university. They're absolutely qualified. But they are so old! Tai Chi born out of Wuji. Jie! Come on! Hello, handsome. Look at his muscles! Sit down! That whistle-blower... What a referee! He sent us off... - Damn! I was on a roll... - I was having so much fun... Me too. Jie, we asked you to come here because we brought something for you. Jie, we saw you on TV and we feel really sorry. We never fulfilled our responsibilities as parents. Play well in the basketball game. We'll be there for you in the audience. Masters, is it really from my parents? Uncle Li gave us this letter last night. This is what changed our minds. It's impossible... You'd never have thought we'd recover from those injuries. ♪ Sticks of sugar-coated fruits flying out when I kick ♪ Memories spreading out in the moonlight when I punch ♪ A piece of ginger, a piece of t he past ♪ I can give you an autograph for a keepsake ♪ I say a windshield protects us from snowstorms ♪ A roof shields us from moonlight ♪ A window should be installed in the world of martial arts ♪ A lance should be spun in a Peking Opera ♪ I stand firm in the horse stance ♪ I put on a kung fu suit when I'm bored and tired ♪ I don't sell tofu ♪ What I learn in the martial arts school is called kung fu ♪ Kung fu, kung fu kung fu, kung fu ♪ Quick, put on your qipao so I can't take advantage of you ♪ You're just like tofu ♪ Your beautiful skin seduces me when I'm practising kung fu ♪ Kung fu, kung fu kung fu, kung fu ♪ Quick, put on your qipao so I can't take advantage of you ♪ When I kick lightly ♪ You're thrown to the edge of the world ♪ If I kicked too hard, ♪ There would be no world left ♪ Flowers falling in the sunset ♪ Climbing over mountains, crossing over rivers ♪ I clear my throat and start to sing Peking Opera ♪ Flying up to Dunhuang Going deep into the Wild North ♪ Who is there when I turn around? ♪ Ah, what kind of place is it?

Too late to use Qigong! Don't be afraid. Everyone is watching him. But it's your show now. Jie, hang in there. He can't jump any more. Watch out for Xiao Ian. Hey, what the hell is this? - You're the referee. - No, I'm Bi Tianhao's secret weapon. Goaltending! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Rules against goal tending only apply to players. He's the referee, and he's disqualified as a referee. But the point is - you lost!! Fire Ball win! Everything in this world is made of tiny particles. "Altering Universe" disassembles those particles, and rebuilds it. In a split second, time is stopped. You can even turn the clock back. He's not throwing. He's passing the ball! Now, I've finally understood basketball isn't all about dunking. It's about teamwork. Hello? What? They want Jie back? What contract? It's just an agreement! OK, but we'll talk about the money later. I'm busy. I'm off to celebrate! That's it, bye! What a snub! What the hell is this? Boss, remember our bet, 5 million? Who asked you to bet... You won't get away with it. Our son is over there! Please sign it. Again, please. Thank you. - You looked so cool in the match. - Thank you. - Sorry, I ran out of ink. - Never mind. The autograph looks exactly like his. - Who are you? - I'm a fan of yours! - This handwriting looks very familiar. - Very neat. I seem to have seen it somewhere before. Sure. In the letter your masters gave you. What's up? You're not happy with it? Would your masters have come if I hadn't written the letter? If they hadn't come, would you have won the game? If you didn't win the game, how would you become famous? Hey, are you leaving? OK. Anyway, sooner or later you'll leave me. - They always do when they get famous. - Hey, can't I just go for a pee? I knew it... You care about people. I noticed your thick ear lobes the first time I met you. So I knew... you care about people. Excuse me. Which one is Fang Shijie? Wang Yiwuan! His birth father is the richest man in Asia? Wang Yiwuan! Choose a nice suit. You look so shabby. You can't go to meet your father like that. How about this one? It looks pricey. How pricey can it be? It's just a suit. Wow. So expensive. 26,000 dollars! Never mind, count it as my gift to you. - A gift for me? - Yeah, the last one. Oh, you're a poor man now but you'll be rich tomorrow. You'll have too much money to spend. Will you still need gifts then? You're so good to me. Don't be so naive. I've always treated you as a cash cow. Moreover, there are lots of greedy people like me out there. Never trust other people when you're rich. Be smart! Try it on, quick. - Do I look good? - Of course you do. Such a pricey suit. I'll try it on, then. Why did we stop at this shop? Should have gone further. Damned place! This is extortion! I left this glass ball with you. So it would prove that you're my son. Son... Why did you abandon me? I was bankrupt in those days. My creditors were after me all the time. For your safety, I had to leave you, my dearest son... I didn't want you to be dragged into my problems. Son... come over. Let me have a look at you. Go, your father is calling you. I owe you so much. I plan to take you to London tomorrow. I want to declare you as my heir... in the capital of finance. I have so much to tell you. So much to talk about. Come to the study with me. You look listless. If you're thinking of Jie, why don't you go see him? He's in a different world now. He has a new life and new friends. Don't greet him next time you see him. He's very different now. You didn't eat anything all day. Let me get you something to eat. Drinking alone? - A '92 mixed with a '94? - Wrong! It's a '02 with a '82. Really pricey stuff. I thought you'd gone to London with your dad. It suits me better here. Idiot! Why didn't you leave? I'm waiting here for someone. He coaxed me into playing basketball. He wanted me to become famous so I could be his cash cow. But I know he's not a bad guy. He just pins all his hopes on me. And that has changed me. I cannot leave him behind. The guy you're talking about is a born loser. He loses in everything, has done all his life. When he was about to give up his life, he came across a baby. This baby brought back not only his life but also his pride. Thank you. Can I keep playing basketball for you? Basketball? Useless... Get ready for the Olympics. I'll send the submission to the committee. High jump, long jump, javelin throw, shot put, pole vault... You can get at least ten gold medals. Maybe archery as well. - Really? - Of course. You're a kung fu kid! Yeah, I forgot I knew kung fu. I can swim as well. We can easily earn millions of dollars just from advertising. Cheers! Here's to our grand plan. Cheers! When you have earned tons of money, you can be a movie star or a singer. Write some good songs and make a lot of money! But I can't sing... I'll take you on a space trip. - Space? - No paparazzi there. Paparazzi? That's it, the end of the story of my search for my parents. My four masters became famous after t he match. But you haven't heard what happened between them and Headmaster Wang Biao before the match. So, you're the World No 1 Fist God! No, no... That was a long time ago... Not worth mentioning it at all. I'd like to take this chance to fight Headmaster Wang Biao. If I lose, I'll join you immediately. Fantastic, it's so easy! Headmaster Wang... No, no... I've sworn to leave the world of martial arts and never fight again. OK. See you on the basketball court. - Come on. - Come on. Wang Biao, if you keep finding excuses, you'll be punished even more. Stop! Who's first? I'll finish him off as soon as possible. We were friends, right? Please don't be too heavy-handed... Don't worry, I won't be heavy-handed... I'll just finish you off. And Lily... She finally said to me: When are you going to treat me to an ice cream?
