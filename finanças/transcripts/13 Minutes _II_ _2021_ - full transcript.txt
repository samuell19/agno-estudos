Luke, Rick! Fire, fire! Luke! Rick! Fire! Luke, get up. Luke! Shit. Get the canister! Go, go, go, go, go! Spray higher. Aim higher, Tammy. It's the Early Bird Sky Watch. Yesterday's system that ravaged towns across the panhandle will shift east and continue through today with tornadoes. Hey. Time to wake up. It's 5:00. Farmers, that's who. Oh! You're up early. Yeah, just meeting a friend for breakfast. I know why I look like shit. What's your reason? Uh, the storm woke me. What storm? Jesus, Mom. How much did you drink? Don't make something out of nothing. And don't take the Lord's name. Besides, I'm allowed a night out once in a while. You still got me booked this afternoon? Yeah. I thought you said you were going out for breakfast. Uh, yeah, just, um... Who are you going with this early anyway? - Just a guy. - A guy? Yeah. You don't know him. He's from out of town. Hey! Have fun. So these windmills, how soon you think you can have 'em up? As soon as can be, if the land proves suitable. And that's a hundred, right? At 8K a unit. Still sound good? Sounds like an answer to prayers at that price. Is everything good? Over there could be karst. - You gonna run the GPR? - Yeah. Karst? What's that? What it means is there's a chance the soil's too soft. This land hadn't been plowed in years. Yeah, this kind of thing runs deeper. Could be caves or craters down there. Did Tom pay his rent on the cattle yet? No. Still waiting on last month too. Oh, boy. What is that barn gonna cost us? We gonna be able to cover the mortgage? I'll move some stuff over from savings, then I'll go by Tom's after I'm finished at the clinic this morning, see what's what. I'll be back around noon. Well, remind him that we're not a charity. I will. And how is it that a mile down the road, they got rows of those things? But this land, this land's not suitable. They'll figure it out. One day our grandchildren are gonna be running this place. We don't have grandkids, Tammy. One day we will. We expect multiple rounds of severe storms and could be dealing with a tornado outbreak beginning as early as noon. We will be providing live details. Get that seed in yet? It'll be done today. What are you thinking about today's outlook? It's a nasty setup. Couldn't sleep a wink. And after yesterday? Come on, Peyton. Hey, where is my kiss? I'll call you later, okay? Have a good day. You too. What time are you gonna be home? I don't know. It's a weather day. Yeah, well, same for me too. I just need to know what time to tell the sitter. You figure it out. You always do. Really? Hey, Steve, what's up? No, no, no, it's fine. What network was reporting that? No, they shouldn't be putting that message out. Well, because we don't know that. Well, I spoke to the National Weather Service about 20 minutes ago. Okay, sounds good. I'll see you soon. Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. Did it fall out again? Is that better? Okay. What are you looking at? I'm glad to know the birds know what to do. What do you do if a watch is issued? What if a watch becomes a warning? That's right. You will be okay. You don't know that. If you want to talk through this again, I can stay. I'll do it... when I'm ready. Daniel. Daniel, come here. Come here. You gotta know that until you're honest, what we're doing, this is not real. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna. You said that before. Daniel! - Oh! - Sorry. Daniel? What happened? Engine light's on in the wagon again. Oh. Jeez, Vicky, you scared the heck out of me. I thought maybe somebody got a finger chopped. Dirty mitts off. Seriously, if I have to say it again, I will quit. No fucking joke. Come on, you know I'm playing. I'll do this. Okay. Please. I don't think I can do that. Do what? You're not worried about losing your job? I'm worried I'm gonna lose my sanity. We can get this looked at this afternoon. I'll give you a call. Oh, I was supposed to bring it in last week, but the twins had flu. Kinda told my boss it'd be ready today. Now there's gonna be weather. There's always weather. Come on, Jess. Okay, well, if we don't have to order any parts, still, mid-afternoon is the best I can do. - You're an angel - We both know that's not true. - I'll call you later. - Thanks. - Greg. - Yeah? - We need to prioritize this. - Really? I'm gonna go next door and get us a round of coffees. All right. Hey, uh... Put the van back, will ya? Not just for the hills because listening could save your life. It's important you have multiple ways to receive warnings. Make sure you have fresh batteries in your weather radio. Keep your TV or radio turned up and tuned in to your favorite reliable source. Listen for those sirens, but don't rely on them alone. Madeline? Where, oh, where is this little baby hiding? Sometimes it's a little tricky to see. Let's see. Oh, there. There, there, look. Look at that. It's that little head of that little... little baby boy or girl. Have you thought about names at all? Um, well, I called for... About abortion. Oh, I know you did. I saw that on your chart. I also saw that you're 19 years old. Do you know that that is just one year younger than when I got married? Now, there are a lot of good reasons to get married, but oh, having a baby, now, that is the best. Have you and your boyfriend considered getting married, honey? Babies... Babies are a blessing from God. Do you know when I had my little boy, I didn't even hear him cry? All I heard was an angel singing down on me, blessing me. I have to go. I have to go. You have been blessed, honey. I'm sorry. This baby... Have this baby. Get married. Consider adoption! Oh... my. Hey. Boy, that was fast. It's not a real place. It's just these people pretending, so that they can like convert you or something. What? They showed it to me. That's not right. Oh, don't look like that. Come here. All right. What if we got married? I mean, we really haven't known each other that long. But you said that you loved me. I said I loved being with you. Oh, Maddy, this is all coming out wrong. I'm sorry. Just... You know what? What are you doing? I got that for you. Yeah? Jesus, Maddy, that was expensive! Maddy! Hey, what are you gonna do? You just gonna leave? Shit! Morning. Hey, wait, wait. Back it up there, chiquita. I want one of those on every bed. We're fresh out of the Spanish version, so you're gonna have to translate it for your guest your own self. I see everything around here. No, he's not my guest. He's my fianc√©. Is he living with you? Mm-hmm. For a short time. We're buying a house. I'm signing the papers today. Uh, you're working today. Oh, wait a minute. So from now to whenever that is... that's your weekly. I've been here over two years. The rate's always been the same. One person, one rate. Two people, different rate. Capisce? And one more thing, sweetheart. I don't want to see that truckload of spics out front anymore. If your boyfriend wants a ride, he can wait out by the street like the rest of 'em. You know "capisce" is Italian, right? Don't you start. The rattle's fixed. It's parked out by eight. Oh, don't worry. I'll get the door myself. Attagirl. Get out. I said get out, puta! The next thing is signage for schools, stores, gas stations, churches, anything else you can think of. This is countywide? Correct, yeah. What's the message? "Tornadoes possible. Be weather aware." Kim, do you think that's strong enough? - They've gone high risk. - I'm aware. We need people to respond calmly and quickly in the event that a warning's issued. If we shout the sky's falling one too many times with nothing happening, no one will take action when it does. Are we gonna go over the infrastructure response protocol? Everybody should know their IRP responsibilities. I know mine. Does anyone feel the need to review? Okay, let's move on. He sure is a cute little guy. Just a little off the bangs and the back. - Not too much. - Okay. Exactly how I usually have it, yeah? She's real good. She cuts my hair all the time. - Hi. - Can we help you? Oh, hi, Anita. - Ana. - Ana, right. Isn't that what I said? Can I use the back for a sec? - This won't take five minutes. - Oh, sure. Hi. Thanks again for meeting me here. My day's chockablock. Do you mind? Aww! Your little lion! Oh, no! You might actually have to pick him up. What's the matter, my little guy? Like I said on the phone, you're getting a great price on this one. Really fantastic. You got any questions? Um... I don't think so. All that's left to do is sign. If I could get your signature here... and here. That's it. It's mine. As soon as the deposit check clears. Oh, you need it now? Um, I'll go right to the bank. Do me a favor. Drop it by my office this afternoon. - I won't be here that long. - Of course. Time for another weather update, and I hope you're all listening because we're talking about the potential for some very dangerous... How'd it go? Commission's barely worth it on deals that small. Least I can say I've done my charity work for the day. Hey! Unbelievable. Hey, it's not a herd of dogs. If you wanna get 'em over here, you gotta lure 'em, all right? Go over there to that barn and get some of that sweet hay, get it in the truck, bring it over here. Go over to that barn and get some sweet hay, put it... Daniel! Get your ass over here. I told you to get me hands that know cattle. He knows. He don't know his ass from his elbow. He don't speak English either. - He's a good man. - I said skilled labor, not just whatever friends and family you had laying around. Inefficient labor cost me money, Daniel. I'm not done here. What time of day you call this? Morning? No. Morning was back when the barn caught on fire. What? Where the hell were you anyway? You know what? Forget it. We'll get into it later. That new guy? Worthless as tits on a bull. What new guy? What do you mean? You don't have papers on him? He's been here for days. God! You smell like a distillery too. I can smell you from here. I hope she was worth it. - What's your name, buddy? - Carlos. I asked him, not you. You got a work permit? I no have here. Don't worry. He's a good worker. I don't care if he's the Wizard of Oz. He turns up here again without papers, my first call's to ICE, you understand? - Do you understand? - Yes. Good. Make sure he does. Found you. Oh! Oh, God. Ow! God... Why don't you just call Greg? Come on. He's not even dealer-certified. After what we paid in repairs last year, should've just bought a new one. Well, we can't afford a new one, so what do you wanna do? You wanna take out a new line of credit? No. Okay. Well, then you call Greg, tell him to fix it. If you don't want to do that, then you rent one. The important thing is that we get that seed into the ground. Renting's not cheap either. All right, honey, what do you want to do? Damn. Mr. Mechanico! You, Mr. Mechanico. Yeah, you. Mira. It's broken. Take a look. Hmm... Greg? Yeah, Rick. Yes, again. Uh, listen, I've got... I've got labor here. Um, think you could just sell me some parts? All right. Uh, nosotros. Okay, uh... Go here. Get the piezas here. - El mot√©l. - ¬°S√¨! - All right. - Bueno. Okay, good. Adios. Planning on fixing those nails? I'm just saying. It's tacky, and people judge. Tor watch. Maddy, is that what's bothering you? Or is it something else? Ah, it's... Thinking about my life path, that's all. You're going to Tulsa to study cosmetology. Don't tell me you're changing your mind after all the work you put into it. The saving. I'm pregnant. Stop. Maddy, please. Stop. Do you know how far along you are? I don't know, like... seven, eight weeks. Oh. Here. Sit down. Mom, I... Here. Who's the father? Just this guy from Prairie Rock. Is it a relationship? Well, he wants me to, you know, um... He wants me not to have it. And what do you want? I... I don't... I don't... I don't know. Well, I know you're not asking my opinion, but you shouldn't feel pressure either way, not from anyone. You don't have to do anything. By that, I mean... it's your body. Your life. So do you want to have a baby right now? How do I answer that? I mean, how do you decide? Are you prepared to raise a child? People say that abortion is murder. Yeah. I know those people. They are pro-life when the baby's on the inside. The minute it's out, it's a burden to society. I had you pretty young, you know that. And I love you more than anything in the world, but... you kinda ruined my life. You are the best... and most challenging thing that ever happened to me, but you need to know that raising a child is 24-7-365 forever, and it is not easy. Emotionally, financially, in every way. It's just... I love you, but... there's reason you're an only child. What about God? God gave us a choice. And I can't make this one for you. But I will be here no matter what you decide. Okay, here we go. Two BLTs and a tuna wrap. You're not upsetting my staff, are you? Oh, no, just a... mother-daughter moment. How long has this been sitting? You gotta use it straight away, or it'll affect the shade. Okay. Oh, it's... School closures. The whole county. It's Kim. - Hi, Kim. - Hey. I'm sorry to bother you, but is there any way you can go get her? Yeah, um, I need to pick Peyton up from school. You go on. I can finish this. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Yeah, no, yeah, I can be there. I wish I could get there myself, but my hands are tied. Of course. I can be there in five. Hey, hey, give your mother a kiss. Can you just hang on for a sec? Thanks. I love you, baby girl. Do you feel comfortable with this? - It's fine. - You're okay? You know the family plan is on the fridge. You know the pillows and the blankets... In the hall closet. I know. Don't worry. Thank you. Yeah, of course. I'll see you later. Okay. Bye. Hey, if you gotta be at home with your kid, doing like mom things, then you should go. We can handle it. What I need is real-time info as storms fire. Great. - Kim? - Huh? - You ready? - I'll be there in a sec. Now it is early, but this outbreak's already underway. The tornado's being reported off to the west, near the state line. Storms will reach our counties around the metro in just a few hours, during the most volatile part of the day. - All right. - Thanks. I got it. Thanks. All right, don't. It'll rustle. All right. All right, here we go. Five, four... Now I have online the regional emergency manager from Ethel County. A very beautiful woman. I can say that 'cause she happens to be my wife, Kimberly Jones. Hello, Kim, you there? - Hello? - Hi, Brad. Kim, today's a day to be vigilant. Tornado warnings are just outside our viewing area, but we're under a PDS or "particularly dangerous situation" tornado watch. What does that mean for you folks over at Emergency Management? Well, for us it means people need to be aware and prepared. But shouldn't people be worried? No. Prepared is what people need to be. Know where your safe place is, have everything you need on hand because if the sirens go off, you will not have time to go searching. Now, severe weather is pretty common, but what about school closures? Well, the potential today is heightened. Nothing's a sure thing, but the ingredients are coming together. A PDS watch means a potential for numerous destructive tornadoes. An outbreak. Hey! Hey! Your mom is a very important lady, so you get me early. What's wrong? Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. What happened? Oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly. She is gonna understand. Hey, ye... Hey, yeah. We will talk to her, okay? Together. When she gets home, okay? Okay. Hey. What's gonna make this better? Ice cream? Or cookies? Seriously, lame city. Lame-o-tropolis. Lame-donia. - Lame... - Well, well, well. Oh! Ha ha! I wasn't talking about you. You saved my life! Did you hear what he said? Yeah. I cannot be alone with that guy ever. He called me your girlfriend! That's silly. That's just ridiculous, right? - Okay. - Okay. What were you doing in my shower? Next load's coming in 20. Why don't you handle that one? You know what? Fine. Hundreds more where you came from. Don't do that. It's not you, but it is offensive. You know what I think's offensive is people sneaking into this country, taking jobs from taxpaying citizens. Okay. This is what you want to talk about? You got guys working 14, 16 hours a day for minimum wage. You pay in cash. Nobody's forcing them to be here. But if they say no, hundreds more where they came from, hmm? I don't know that I could be who you want. There it is. That's your answer. Do you want to live a lie forever? I won't. All right, if I can just get your autograph. Oh, um, no, no. Se√±or... Mr. Rick, he pay. Yes. I'm not asking you to pay. I need you to sign to claim receipt. Okay. See, this list says... what's in the box. I need you to sign... to say I gave you the parts... in the box. You need to sign. My name. Yeah. Right there. Excellent. Thank you. Ah, yeah. Big storm coming. You don't wanna get stuck out there. Are you headed straight back? Thank you. Drive safe. Goodbye. Thank you. Pleasure. Hey. You are in luck 'cause it's all fixed. Genius. Thank you. I'm getting increasingly concerned about this developing supercell southwest of metro. Now, I want to remind folks out there now, if a tornado warning is issued for your area, what you need to do is... Hello and welcome to English for Beginners. In this four-disc series, we're going to learn basic words. Maddy? Hey, it's me. Come on. Okay, um... I have to talk... with my friend outside, okay? If you need me, I'm out there, okay? Okay. You can't be here. What, are you just ignoring me? No, I'm not ignoring you. I can't talk to you right now. I can't have this hanging over me. Can we just talk? - Like two minutes. - Yeah. - That's it. - Okay. Okay. Look, all I want to say is that if you want to have it, you should have it. But I don't want to meet it or see it or be involved. I wouldn't want you to be. This morning, you wanted to get married. No, don't worry. I don't. Look, this isn't gonna be easy. And how the hell would you know that? I have two already. This wasn't supposed to happen. So you have a wife too? - Maddy, please. - No, don't, don't touch me! So you're not getting any signal from Currents? The west side, no, but I'm trying to contact the east. It shows that my messages are being received. Do you have the alerts going out? To Calumet, yes. I'm trying my best. SBC's gotten a dozen tornado reports and counting. Sounds like the worst of it's out by Coopertown. Extensive damage. Large and violent near Hinckley and Atherton. Discovered one in the morning. Oh, yeah? What's this drain work? I didn't see any receipt for it. Let's not pay it. Hi, baby. Well, I gave you everything that was in the folder. How are you? Don't worry about this, baby. We're gonna get through it. We always do get through it, and we're gonna get through it again, right? Yeah. This one... Look. I can't even read that. - It's the feed store. - Oh, that's... They don't write in English, mister. Okay. Luke, what is up with the sad face? I'm gay. What'd you say? I'm sorry. Just 'cause you can't keep a girlfriend... I'm gay. I've tried to be what you wanted. I... Hard-working, patriotic, Christian. Those things? The purpose of a man and a woman is to get married and make babies. Anything else transcends the laws of nature. Tammy, I'm... You're not gay! Hi, this is Maddy. Sorry I missed you... Kim, do you have a minute? I will call you back. Maddy, I need to know you guys are home. Please call me. Do have any further information on a specific location? Sorry. Yes? Got it. Thank you. It's us. A tornado warning has been issued for the following counties: Ethel, Caddo... We should go to the cellar. I've been living here 55 years. I know the difference between a tornado warning and a waste-of-time warning. I'm going outside to put up some equipment before it gets beat all to hell. Dad. Take life-saving action now. Mom. Mom, what are you doing? I'm getting the house ready. A tornado warning has been issued for the following counties... Our friends in Kiowa, Caddo, and Ethel counties, I want you to take your tornado precautions now. We have tornado warnings for three supercells impacting these areas. If you're listening at home, what I want you to do is go to the lowest floor possible. Find a room in the center of the house, ideally an interior bathroom or closet. Wrap yourself up in pillows and blankets to protect yourself from flying debris. Don't waste time opening up windows like they told you to do in the '60s. Tornadoes will do that for you. If you're on the road, now's the time to get to a sturdy building. If you can't find one, get in a ditch. Do not... I repeat... do not seek shelter under an overpass. I'll tell you, this is an HP high-precipitation supercell. If this thing's on the ground, it's gonna be rain-wrapped, so don't be caught out there trying to get a view. You're not gonna see it till it's on you. Go, go, go. If you're not in a safe place, you need to get there now. This doesn't have to be a thing. And what does that mean? I can't afford another kid, Maddy. Kids are expensive. But yeah, if you choose to have it, I'd do my best. But you gotta understand, I don't have a lot of money, all right? I just don't. To my friends in Minninnewah... What are you going to do? You can't leave me hanging like this. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know! - Maddy... - Stop. And this is the I-40. You need to leave. This thing's basically riding the interstate, folks. Stay here. Hey, hey. Tornado! Tornado! Everybody out! Tornado! Tornado! Tornado! Follow me! - Follow me! - Hey, where is the manager? Come on! Get in! Mom! Mom! Mom! Come here! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Wait! Wait, wait. How are you? How... are... you? En repuesta, puede decir. I... am... fine. - I've never seen it like this. - Shh! Stop it. You're gonna scare them. Hey, calm down. Everything is gonna be all right, okay? Calm down. It's insane out there. Hail's smashing everything up. They say it hit Big Heart. - The casino? - Yeah. You sure this is the safest place to be? Oh, my God! What? - Get your cart. - My cart? Yes, and go to the kitchen. Yes! Go! Now! Fast! Everybody listen, please. Follow me. This way. Everybody come. Stay back from the windows! Back, back, back! Keep them coming. Come on. Here. Everybody in. It won't lock. It won't lock! - Wait! Wait, wait, wait. - What is it? Watch out, watch out. Hold on. I gotta tie it. It should be closing. Come on. Hold it. You got it. - Okay, hold on. - Okay. All right. A tornado emergency for the town of Minninnewah and points northeast. Folks, this is a one-in-a-thousand type warning. Kim! Kim, come on! Peyton! There's no time, okay? Okay, go, go, go, go, go! - Ana! - Shh! Maddy! Peyton! Still waiting for pictures. KWBD has a crew en route. Okay, here we go, folks. First shots are coming through. And, uh, what are we looking at here? Is this Prairie Rock? Is that confirmed? Okay, these pictures just coming through now of, uh... It looks like... Holy... It's not a lot. That looks like Big Heart Casino. I mean, these fields out here, folks, you can see where the tornado just cut across. Did you hear anything from my wife? Okay, if you're from, uh, if you're in Minninnewah, the storm has passed. The structures are unsound and, uh... Peter, just give me a signal when you get her, okay? I want you to stay away from water, okay? If you could safely get to circuit boards to shut them off, that would be great. You could turn off, uh, gas lines and... Look, folks, I'm gonna ask Ashlynn to step in here for me. I'm gonna hand over coverage to her. She'll get you through this, all right? - Did you get her? - There's no cell service. Regional Emergency Management teams will be setting up relief centers at the following locations. Daniel, Daniel! Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana! Someone help. Help me. Ana! Ana! Ana. Oh, man. Hold still. Put that on there. I know, I know, I know. Help! Ah, jeez! Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Holy shit. Do you smell gas? Hold up. Everyone, we have to go. We have to go right now. Come on, let's go. Jess? Have to find Maddy. I know how hard this is, but this is our job. This is what we signed up for. We've got a whole town counting on us. Come on. Mom. Are you okay? Mom. Come on, Mom. Luke! Rick! Rick? Dad! Rick, Rick! Dad, Dad! Dad! Dad. Dad, can you hear me? Is he breathing? Right here, right here. No, no, that's too low, that's too low. Do the breathing. Rick, come on, baby. One, two, three, four. Wait. Wait till thirty. One, two, three, four... - Help! - Six, seven, eight, nine... Daniel! Breathe two times. Big, hon. One, two... No more. Three, four... Oh! Oh, my God. Ay, mi amor. Ay. Shh... Come here. Hey. Wake up! Come on, wake up! Help! Hey! Over here! I need help! - Be careful. - Come on! Be careful. Hey. Vicky! Vicky! Jess, stay back. What is it? No, Jess, don't! Do not come any closer! Vicki, what? Let me help! Please don't! No! No! Jess, don't. I have this. - Jess, I don't want you to see. - No. Get her out. Get her out! - I won't... - Careful. Watch it. Hey, can you help us? My daughter's under here. Please. Careful. Maddy! Okay, watch it. Oh, my God. Honey, honey. Maddy, babe. Well, what, is she... Vicky, please! Switch! One, two... - Three, four... - Faster! Five, six, seven, eight, - Nine, ten... - Come on, baby. 11, 12, 13, 14... 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20... 27, 28, 29... - 29, 30. - Stop! It's working, it's working... I think. It's okay. - He's gonna be okay. - Come on. He's breathing. We gotta get him out of here. Rick! Mom, he's gonna make it. I need to take him out of here. One, two, three! - This good? - That's perfect. As soon as more people come, we need to get them registered. - I can do that. - Okay. We need to call the power company, get them to shut the grid down. I can do that... as soon as we get service. She's gotta get to a hospital. Can you take them? I need to look for Peyton. You're not coming? I'm gonna keep looking for Peyton. Why don't I stay? You two go. Uh... Are you sure? Yeah. Thank you. Give first responders space to get in and save lives. If you're in Minninnewah, you'll find assistance at New Hope Church on the northeast corner of Arrowhead and Chestnut. For those of you in Prairie Rock, your center is right in town. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, watch him. Excuse me. Can we load your truck up? These people are hurt. You were all under this overpass? Did you hear me? It's Brad, isn't it? Under the overpass. We need your help. Brad, we need your help. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Get the other side of him. Get the other side. - Get him in the truck. - Come on, come on. Watch his hand. Come on. It's okay, come on. Now, easy with him. Watch his hand. His hand, goddamn it. Now, I don't know this guy's name, but his fianc√©e is Ana Gomez. - Now, you got that? - Yeah. Now tell whoever you drop him off with, Ana Maria Gomez. Okay, got it. Ana Maria Gomez. Ana Maria Gomez. Just gotta sign this to get her registered, okay? I'm so sorry. Help! Somebody! Somebody! Come this way. This is where we have triage set up, over here. This way. Steve, will you help me? We're gonna transfer him. Mom, Mom... Hold him tight. Oh, be careful. Baby, just stay with me, baby. We will travel with him soon enough. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Jess? Jess. Where's Peyton? We kept looking for her, but... - What? What? - I don't know. Peyton! Peyton! Um, they told me to bring him here. Yeah. Now... you look after him. Be about two minutes, okay? Yeah. Hey! Hey, did you find her? I don't think she could've survived that. You just decided that? There's no way you could know that. Babe? Babe. Oh, my God. Oh. Look at you. What the hell are you doing? Mom. No, Mom. - Leave. Now. - Mom. Hey. Hey. Um... Would you get me some water? Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'll be right back. Maddy, honey. - Mom... - You can't possibly... Just close the door. You're my masterpiece, you know that? Phones are back up.
