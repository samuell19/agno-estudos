Okay, Jackie, your total is 67.85, please. All right. Here you go, my friend. Hey, yo, Jackie. Hey, Sal. What's going on, man? What's up, man? How you doing? All right. How you doing? - Good to see ya. - You too. Yeah, what's going on? Where's your turkey today? Uh, my sister's house. My mom just moved in over there, so we're doing Thanksgiving. Oh, nice, man. Nice. Well, say hi to your mom and Beth for me. I will. You still reffin' the Catholic League games? Little bit, here and there. Yeah, my oldest is at UC Santa Cruz. So, you know, every little bit helps, right? You bet. Well, happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving, Jackie. Good seeing ya. - You too, Sal. - What's up, man? Give me a couple of scratch-offs, please. - Sure. - Thank you. Don't fill up on bread. You gotta eat the rest of your beans. Okay? Hey! Happy Thanksgiving. - Hey, Uncle Jack's here! - Look who's here. Hey. Happy Thanksgiving to you. How you doing, man? Glad you could make it. No problem. How's the car business? It is going good. - Thank you for asking. - Good. Would you like some wine? No. I have some. Thank you very much. Hi, Uncle Fart-Poop. Uncle Fart-Poop! Don't tickle me! No, no, no. - Uncle Jack's getting tickled. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi, Mom. - Mmm. - Hello, sweetheart. - All right. Good. - Hey. Happy Thanksgiving. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. - Really? Yeah. Some people call when they're late. I didn't have my phone with me. Oh. Well, then why have a phone if you're not gonna use it? I don't know. That's a good question. How you doing, buddy? - I'm good. - Good to see you. I don't understand why somebody has a phone if they don't ever answer it. Can I have some of those potatoes, Mom? Do you want some potatoes? Thank you so much. Did your mom ever tell you about our fish tank - when we were kids? - No. Well, your grandmother took us to the pet store and we got a fish tank, you know, a bunch of cool fish. And I came from school the next day, and the fish tank was filled with shampoo. And all the fish were dead. And your mom was there crying. And Grandma said, "Why'd you put shampoo in the fish tank?" And your mom said, "I wanted to give the fish a bubble bath." Why'd she give the fish a bubble bath? You're gonna have to ask your mom. I don't know. I guess she always wanted to take care of everybody. Mwah. I love you. Don't let your mom near those fish. Good night, Uncle Jack. Good night, chief. Hey. Hey. How's Mom, uh, settling in? Uh, good. Yeah, really good. She seems to be. Can't believe you got her outta Seaside. Right? It's different now. It's just all, like, young kids... - Yeah. - ...and little couples... running around, families. I think she was feeling like a castaway out there. Yeah, you did good. I'm glad she's here. What's going on with you? What's new? Not much. Are you seeing anybody? No. I wish you would. I really do. I would feel much better. I hate the idea of you down there by yourself all the time. What do you hate about it so much? That you're, you know, just alone. Just drinking all the time and... I'm fine. I appreciate it. But it's... I'm fine. I know that Ang worries about you, so... What does Ang have to do with it? Why do you know what Ang would worry about? Because she called and she wanted to see how you were doing. - She called you? - Yeah. - Why? - Is that okay? I don't know. I mean, what, she called you to talk about me? Why didn't she just call me directly? She just wanted to see how you're doing. Well... I... I'm fine. Look, I know Kathy Collins says she sees your car outside Harold's bar every night. Well, if Kathy Collins says it, - must be true. - Mmm-hmm. You know that something must be wrong. So, I go to work, and then after work sometimes I go have a beer. I'm just saying... You better start calling people. - Okay. - Better get on - this fucking case. - Okay. She has other things maybe she ought to be worrying about instead of worrying about how much I drink. I mean, she needs to worry about staying out - of her fucking refrigerator. - Nice. She's losing a huge war against the refrigerator. What are you talking about? Jack... She needs to find the fucking treadmill. Stop it. That is so mean. She's my friend. Well, she should mind her business. - Okay. - That's why I don't come here. 'Cause it always turns to... Which one of the 20 bedrooms am I supposed to be staying in? Take the second one on the left. Hey, Ang, it's Jack. I'm just, uh... Happy Thanksgiving. I wanted to call you, see how you're doing. And also because my sister told me that you had called her and wanted to know how I was doing. I'm just saying, if you want to know in the future how I'm doing, you can call me, as I still have the same phone number that I had... when we were married. Hey, Jack, it's Miguel. Haven't heard from you for a while, so... Sofia was asking about you. Thought I'd give you a call and see how you're doing. Thought maybe we'd have you over... Hello, Jack, this is Father Edward Devine calling from Bishop Hayes High School. Will you give me a call back here at the rectory when you get a chance? 1-424-145-3233. And I'll be up until about 10:00 this evening. If that doesn't work, we can chat in the morning. Thanks, Jack. God bless. Hello, Jack. Hi. How are you? Come on in. Thanks so much. So, did you have a nice Thanksgiving? I did. How about you? Oh, it was very nice. All the kids and the grandkids were in. - I was in my glory. - I bet. - Good for you. - Oh. You can go right in here. Father Devine is just finishing up a call. So, he will be out in just a couple of minutes, so just make yourself comfortable. - Thanks. - Yeah. We are all so excited at the idea of you possibly coming back to be with us at Hayes. It's nice to see you again, Jack. Hello, Jack. Hey, Father. It's good to see you. Thanks for making the drive. Sure. No problem. Sit down, please. So, been a while, hasn't it? Yeah. Since, uh... my father's funeral. - That long? - Mmm. My goodness. Where does the time go? If I knew, I would tell ya. Married? I'm separated now. For a while. Any children? No kids. Okay. Well, Jack, it is really good to see you again. And I suppose you're wondering why I called you over here. I'm a little curious. Yeah. Our basketball coach, Tom McGarrity, had a heart attack the other night. Oh, no. He's expected to make a full recovery, but his wife doesn't think it's a very good idea for him to return to the team. And I tend to agree. We need a new coach, Jack. You're the first person I thought of. Try to suppress your enthusiasm. No, I appreciate it. I just... It's, um... You know, it's just, I've been away from the game for a long time. I understand. I understand. You know, I've never even coached before. I just played, so I don't... Is the, uh... I mean... Is the team any good? No. No. We haven't been competitive for quite a while, actually. In fact, the last time they made the playoffs? Back when you were playing. Wow. Well, I really appreciate you thinking of me, Father. It's just, I... Go home and think it over, Jack. I got a lot going on in my life right now. It's very busy. Go home, think it over. Call me with your decision in the morning. Tomorrow morning? Our next game is Monday night, Jack. I don't have a lot of time. Hey, Father, listen, I... Mmm... Thank you so much for thinking of me. Um... It's just not the right time for me to take this on. Um... You know, my life's very full right now. Very full. I just, um... I've just been away from the game for so long, you know? I've just been away from the game for so long. Father... Listen, I've given it a lot of thought, and I appreciate it. It's just not the right time for me right now. I've been away from the game for so long. I don't think I can help you. I don't think... I don't think I can help you. I don't think I can help you. Father. Jack. Not gonna happen. What the fuck am I supposed to do? The team can't play. They're no good. They're no good. I can't wave a magic wand, turn them into fucking Michael Jordan. I mean, just... I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. I can't help you with this. I can't help you with this team. Father, I've given it a lot of thought. I just have no interest in coaching your fucking basketball team. That's all there is to it. Oh, fuck. Get back on D! Make up for it. What the fuck? Hey, G. G! D up! Hey, get back! Let's go! Let's go! Move! Go quick! Quickly, quickly, quickly. Stop him up top. Chubbs, go to the wing. Watch it. Screen, screen, screen. Yo, get through, get through. Get through that. - Hey, Freeze. - Go! - Good pass. - Come on! - Hey, nice job, D-boy. - What's up, Chubbs? Hey, Coach. Dan Espinosa. Nice to meet ya. - You're the assistant? - I am. Uh, I also teach algebra here at the school. Uh, I really appreciate you stepping up like this. It means a lot to the boys. Um, do you want me to call everybody in, - do some intros? - No, that's okay. Just, uh... - Take the layup, Marcus! - Money! Just get a feel for what I'm working with here. Yeah. This the whole team? Ten kids? That's all we've got. A lot different than when you played here, huh? Yeah. No shit. We got 100 kids just try out. 104 my senior year. Play ball here? Well, not like you. Spent most of my time on the bench, holding a clipboard like I am now. I was a couple of years behind you. Uh, class of '98. Enrollment's really taken a dive since then. Freeze, Freeze, Freeze! I can run down the starting five, if you like. - Box out! - Sure. So, uh, the kid with the ball, that's Brandon Durrett. Relation to Russ Durrett? Yeah, that's his son. He's a great player. Really has a good feel for the game. Easily our most talented guy. And then, um, playing besides him in the backcourt, that's Chubbs Hendricks. His, uh, real name's Ronald. - Oh, yeah. - Right here, this man. And, um, Kenny Dawes out on the wing. Bit of a showboat, but, uh... Yeah, he's a solid shooter. - Whoo! - Good long-range stroke. Get back! Get back! And Sam Garcia, he's our senior captain. Not much of a scoring threat, but he's a solid defender. Good kid. And then Marcus Parrish. - Money! - That is our center. What the fuck are you doing, bro? That kid's the center? - Yeah. - What is he, 6'4"? Shut the fuck up, man. 6'3". You guys must get murdered on the boards. Yeah, it's not been good at all. You're giving 'em open buckets, Marcus. This is practice, man. I don't care. Who's that kid there? The white shadow. Oh, yeah, that's, uh, Bobby Freeze. He's our sixth man. He's actually a starting strong safety for the football team. Then the rest of the guys, uh, Dearborn, Daly, Carter, and Amato. I had to bring those guys up from JV just so we could hold a practice. - Take the layup! - Money! Come on, box out! All right. Blow the whistle for me. - Freeze. Chill out, man. - Yo, take it easy, man. Stop grabbing me. That's clean. That's clean D. Bring it in. Let's go. Hustle, hustle. All right, guys. As discussed, I am honored to turn things over to your new head coach, Jack Cunningham. What's up, Coach? - How you doing, guys? - Good. Good. What's up, Coach? You're Marcus, right? That's right. Get used to calling my name, too. All right. All right. Marcus, tell me what you see out there. Um... I see Nikki's fine ass keep looking at me. Saw she was bending over. She tryin' to get my attention. Marcus, just be respectful, please. He asked me what I saw. What, do you want me to lie to him? - You know what I see, Marcus? - What? You're the tallest player on the team. Oh. Makes me wonder why you're putting three-pointers up every time you come down the court. Oh, that's 'cause I got a candy-stroke, Coach. Ask Coach Dan. I made the most threes on the team last year. Coach Dan, how many threes did Marcus make last year? Um, Marcus... made 34. Outta how many attempts? Out of 130. What's that a percentage of? For a percentage of 26. Damn! 26%, Marcus. You wanna know why they're leaving you open? It's 'cause they don't think you could hit the ocean from the beach. Oh, shit. Yo, he just spit facts at your ass, bro. Man, shut up. Look it, come on, man. Don't get all butt-hurt just 'cause he droppin' some knowledge on you. You wanna see butt-hurt? Keep talking shit, - watch me beat your fat ass. - Shut the fuck up, yo. - You ain't gonna do shit. - Hey. I don't need any help. Who is second in threes on the team? Number two would be Kenny with 25. - Outta how many attempts? - Sixty-one. Percentage of? Forty-one. Snap. You hear that? Give me the rock, let me go HAM on some bitches. Yeah, more like ham and cheese, man. Nah, actually, ham and cheese is what your sister fries me up after I'm done fiddling her bean. Yo, show some respect. Coach is here, man. Watch your mouth, man. - Kenny, get in line. - A'ight. All right, run it back. Marcus, this time your feet don't leave the paint. - Brandon. - All right. Let's go. - Come on. - Let's go, y'all. You're the point guard, right? Put 'em in a motion offense. - Chubbs. - Call it out, Brandon. Don't just wave your hand in the air. Doesn't talk much, does he? I have been coaching that kid for three years and I can count on one hand how many times our conversations have gone past, "Yes, Coach" and "No, Coach." - Good shot, baby. - And that's money! Here you go. Keys, game balls, and then I put together a flash drive just in case you want to get familiar with the sets we've been running. I'm also gonna give you my phone number if you have any questions. Okay. Hey, why didn't you take the job? - Huh? - Would've made sense. The assistant coach, step in, take the job. My mom has MS, so... My sister takes care of her during the day, but she's got three kids of her own. So I take nights. Sure. Then with practices, and then you have scouting... Yeah, no. Of course. It makes sense. There just aren't enough hours in the day. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. No, no, no. It's cool. We all have our own cross to bear, right? Um... So you should be good. Great. Thank you very much. No problem. - Oh, Coach. - Yep? What's the dress code like these days? Oh. Coat and tie for the head coach. - Great. Thanks. - Sure. No problem. Yeah! Right here, right here. Yeah! Here we go! Yeah! Take the shot. That's you, Marcus. Hey, Jack. Nice to see you in the gym again. Thanks. That's you. Jack, this is Father Mark Whelan. He is our team chaplain. Pleasure to meet you, Jack. You too. Any first game jitters? Fuck. I'm nervous as shit. Yeah. - What's this? - Oh. They do it before every game. Gets them psyched up, I guess. Let's go! All right, let's go. Bring it in. - Ready? - No. Let's go. All right, guys. Let's see what we're made of. And the big burly inmate says, "Don't worry about it. Everything's gonna be fine. I just want to play a little game." He goes, "Okay." And he says, "In this game, you can pick whether or not you want to be the husband or the wife." And he says, "All right." "Well?" "Well, guess I'll be the husband." He goes, "Okay. Come on over here and suck your wife's dick." That's a good one. "Suck your wife's dick." I fucking love that. Hey, Doc. Hey. How'd opening night go, ace? Yeah, our boy got sent to the woodshed. Hey, get Doc a drink, will ya? And hit me with another one. Doc, did I ever tell you the one about the nerdy accountant who does 15 years for embezzlement? - Don't worry about me. - I'm not. I know. Just let me do... do my thing. Do your thing. All right. I appreciate it. - Okay. - I'm just gonna... - All right. Good night, Doc. - Good night. Get your man! Get your man! Come on! Watch him. Jackie! It's Miguel again. Just checking in to see if you got my call about David's birthday party. Give me a call when you get a chance. Hey, it's me. I know it's late notice, but I'm gonna be down by you for a client visit tomorrow and wanted to see if you wanted to meet for lunch. Anyway, call me when you get this. - Hi. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. Damn bus broke down on the 710. It was a nightmare. I just got here. Okay. You look good. Thanks. You too. How's the new job working out? It's insurance. It's boring, but it pays the bills. Good. Heard you're coaching basketball. Beth tell you that? Yeah. So, you having fun? Yeah. I'd be having more fun if we won a game... ...but keeps me occupied. Keeps my mind off other things. Good. I was worried about you. What were you worried about me for? You weren't moving on with your life. You were seeing the world in some dark ways. Why? Are you? Seeing the world in dark ways? Moving on with your life. Uh-oh. What's his name? Nick. How'd you guys meet? Through mutual friends. How long has it been going on for? Few months. Few months? What, like, six months? Eight months? Okay. All right. Come on. You know what we want for lunch? Um... Just give us a second, actually. Thank you. Sure. I wanted to tell you myself before you found out through one of our friends. Say something, Jack. What do you want me to say? - "Congratulations"? - No. Completely fucking blindsided by this. Not "congratulations." Blindsided? We've been separated for over a year. Will I see you at the birthday party? What? Miguel and Sofia. They're having a birthday party for David. Said he called you a few times. Let me know if you want to go together. Bye. Jackie hits his second free throw and he just holds his hand like this in the air for like 30 seconds. Purcell says, "Jackie, you keep holding your hand like that and Eric's gonna ask you out." Fifty-five points, man. - To the legend. - Yeah. You gotta dim the lights for the man. - To the legend. - To the legend. Get the fuck outta here. Why the fuck do I need a sausage? He was like, "It's a PK. It's a Polish kielbasa." Ah. Yeah. Fellas. Evening, boys. We're talking old times here. I know what you're talking, and I'm telling you it's time for him to get going. Come on, let's go now. Come on. Let's go. - I'm up. - No, you're not. Now you are! I'm up. Whoa! - Shit. - There you go. That's it. Where are you taking my friend? Where are you taking my friend? Okay, okay. Uh, where's Kenny? Kenny is the only one missing. Kenny and Coach. I just want you to know that I respect you, a'ight? - And I love you. - Hmm. Every time that ball goes through the hoop, I'm gonna be thinking about you. - Kenny. - Okay? And that goes through - the hoop a lot. - Kenny, let's go! - The bus is waiting. - Okay. Hey, what up, Coach? - Bye. - Uh... Yeah. - You'll text me? - Yeah, I'll text you after. - Okay. Cool. - Okay. Hey, what's going on, man? Good luck! Oh, thanks. You better watch out. Priests catch you doing that and you're gonna be spending your weekends here. Nah, but it makes my game better though, Coach. Memorial! Memorial! Memorial! Memorial! Memorial! Memorial! Memorial! Memorial! Memorial! Let's go. Hold on, hold on. I want to talk to you. These scrubs ain't worthy of being on the same court as us. - Hey, Coach. - Hey, Coach. How are ya? Good, good. I heard you got a new general in charge. Yeah. Jack Cunningham. Yeah. I'm surprised you could keep him out of the bar long enough to hold practice. Coach Lombardo. Jack Cunningham. He says that like I don't know who he is. He's the best high school basketball player I've ever seen. Listen, I was front row when he hung 47 against Trinity at the Catholic League semis. Got quite a team there, Coach. 21's a hell of a ball player. Yeah. So, how ya liking coaching so far? Great. Just getting used to the players. What players? Ah, I'm just breaking your stones, Jack. - Good luck. - You can have the luck. I'll take the thoroughbreds. What an asshole this guy is. Yeah, big time. Let's go. Bring it in. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Holy shit. Here we go, here we go, here we go. Chubbs. Hey! No more dancing. Coach, are you serious? Yeah. I'm serious. We're one in nine. You're out there jumping around like you hit the Powerball. You're embarrassing yourself. Win a few games, we can talk about bringing it back. But for now, that act's retired. Got it? Yeah. - One, two, three. - Memorial! Hey. Help, help. Let's go! Motion, motion. Let's go! Bring him through. Hey, hey. Back up, back up. Oh, yeah! Show hands. Let's go, guys. You guys gotta move. Oh, yeah! Let's go. Lock him up. Lock him up. - Fuck. - Come on. Time-out! Get over here. All right. Listen up. Come on. Fuck. Get back. Get back! Defense, defense, defense! Back screen, back screen. You guys gotta move! Set picks! Then squeeze! Go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Shoot! Watch the clock! Five, four, three, two, one! Time-out! - Full time-out. - Let's go. Bring it in. Come on. Let's go. Nobody sits down. Stand up. Stand up. I thought I said to force him left. - Coach, I'm trying. - Try harder. What did I say about fading off your man? Why's shit always my fault? Freeze, sub in for Marcus. - You taking me out? - That's right. Sit the fuck down. This is some bullshit, man. Listen to me. I want every one of you to reach in your shorts right now and tell me if you find a pair. 'Cause right now, you're playing like a bunch of fucking pussies. And that's the truth. Next time 32 goes over your back like that, put a fucking elbow in his stomach. Yes, Coach. And if Childress tries to put you on a poster like that, you hit him so fucking hard he never comes down the lane like that again. I got you. Have a little fucking pride. I don't give a shit if we lose every fucking game this year. I will not coach a team that has been out-toughed. All right? Let's go! Fuck yeah, man. Here we go. "Team" on three. One, two, three. Team! I'm in for 50. Come on. Switch up, switch up! Chubbs. Let's go, 3. Come on! Hey, hey, hey. Chill. Get back here. Get back here. Get the fuck off, bro. Hey, get the fuck off, bro. Bro, I'll beat your ass. I'll fuck you up, bitch. That is a flagrant foul. Hey, that's enough. That's enough. I didn't do fucking anything, man. Watch yourself. - Get back there. - Get over there! What the hell is that? That guy should be out. Control your players, Cunningham. That is bullshit, man. What the hell? Come on! Right. All right. - I'm feeling a comeback. - Come on. - Jack? - Yeah. Uh... Just wanted to have a little chat with you about something that was on my mind. Um, I don't know if you recall from your days as a student, but we have a code of conduct at Hayes. Part of that code includes the use of appropriate language. I understand you're trying to motivate the team, I just wonder if maybe there's a different approach. So, you would, uh... You would like me to be a little more, uh... Christlike on the bench? I... I'd like you to keep in mind that our mission at Hayes isn't to win basketball games. It's to develop men of integrity and faith. Just give it some thought for me. Will you do that? - Yes, I will. - Thank you. Father, let me ask you something. With all the terrible stuff going on in the world, you think who's ever up there really gives a shit what I say to these kids? As Christians, we are called by God to integrate our faith into our daily lives. So, yes, Jack. I do think he really gives a shit about the example you set for these young men. Don't underestimate the impact you can have on them. All right. I'll take a look at the game tape. We can talk about if we wanna use that 1-3-1 zone. Got it. Sounds good. Have a good night. - Hey, Jack. - Yeah? I noticed some empty beer cans in the office earlier. Do you... You've been sneaking around the office? Well, Garcia lost a contact lens, so the solution... A friend came by. He wanted to look at some... And we were hanging out. I mean, you're not gonna break my balls about a couple of beer cans, are ya? Just don't let it happen again, okay? Yeah, no problem. Hey, hey, Jackie! I'll set you up inside, all right? All right. We're gonna change things up a little bit. We're the smallest team in the league and our half-court offense sucks. We're gonna score some points with defense. We gotta press. 1-2-1-1. Call it the diamond press. Requires two things, toughness and quickness. We're gonna be picking up after every dead ball. Full court, all game. Keep your clothes on, Marcus. Talking to me? Come late to the game, you don't play. We'll talk about it at practice tomorrow. What are you talking about? I'm, like, four minutes late. You know what? Forget about tomorrow. Go home. You're off the team. Coach Dan, what the hell is his problem? I'm barely late. You heard Coach, Marcus. Go home. Are you fucking serious right now? I'm barely fucking late. Y'all fucking stupid, man. This dumb-ass team. Freeze, you're starting tonight. Means you're gonna be guarding the inbounder, okay? Got it, Coach. Ah, this should be fun. - Evening, Sal. - What's up, Jackie? Give us some friendly whistles tonight, will you? Yeah, right. That's funny. They ain't paying me enough for that. Let's go. Here we go. Freeze, Freeze, Freeze! - Hands up. Hands up! - Freeze, help! Help out. Freeze, help! That's it! - What? Come on, ref. - What's the call, ref? White 23 blocked. Two shots. Oh, bullshit! Come on! That's a fucking horseshit call, Sal. Jack, settle down - or it's gonna cost you. - It's bullshit. And you know it's fucking horseshit. That's why I didn't make it. All right? - Tell him to go fuck himself. - I'll tell him after the game. Bullshit! God damn it! Box out. Box out. Let's go, y'all. Box out. Come on, fellas. Hey, let's box this out. Rebound! Come on, Hayes! Time-out! Time-out! Sal, time-out. God damn it. Time-out. Full time-out here. Full time-out here. God damn, man. Bring it in. Sit down. All right. Come on, guys. Let's go. Let's win this fucking game. We've got 15 seconds left. We're gonna go on 8. Gives us time for a rebound or a tip-in. Brandon, 20's gonna pick you up full court. All right? Freeze, you're gonna come up and set a ball screen for Brandon. Brandon, you roll around to the right. Garcia, come up, set a back screen for Kenny. Kenny, come out to the wing for the three. That way we got three options. Brandon attacking right will look for Freeze coming off the screen. Watch the clock! Watch the clock! If neither of those are there, go to Kenny for the three in the corner. You got this, okay? No, don't just nod. I wanna hear your voice. Yes or no? Yes, Coach. Set it, set it, set it! That's you, B! Go, Brandon! Watch the clock! Watch the clock! We won! Brandon, you need a ride? No, I'm good, Coach. Where do you live? Uh, Los Codona Ave. Come on, get in the car. You walk home alone every night? Mmm-hmm. Where's Mom or Dad? My mom died three years ago and my dad's at home with my little brothers. That's why he didn't come to any of the games? Yeah. You played a hell of a game tonight. Next time, shoot the ball. On the last play? That's your shot, not Kenny's. Yeah, the defense collapsed on me, so Kenny was open in the corner. Right. So that was a smart play. Sometimes a smart play is not the right play. You're the best player on the team. The game's on the line, 100 times out of 100 I want you taking that shot. Why is that so hard for you to believe? What? That you're the best player on the team. You understand this game in a way these guys don't. I saw you get frustrated at Chubbs when he didn't go backdoor on the ball reverse. Or Freeze, when he didn't duck under on the Atlanta set. Why didn't you call him out for not making the right play? Uh, it's not really my thing to call someone out. I'm not, like, the team captain or nothing, so... So, if I make you the captain, are you gonna chew Chubbs out when he doesn't go backdoor? Yes or no? I'm just up here on the left. Night, Coach. Hey, son. Who that? That's my new coach. All right. Go on, get with that homework. Yes, sir. Atlanta high, Atlanta high. Stop, stop, stop. Reset. - What set are we in, Brandon? - Atlanta high. - Did you call it out? - Yeah. - Did you guys hear him? - Nah. We're in an empty gym, and nobody heard you. Do it again. Atlanta high. Atlanta high. Reset. Brandon, I still can't hear you. You're gonna be our point guard, people need to be able to hear what you say on the floor. You hear how loud I'm talking right now? - Yeah. - That's how loud - you need to be. - All right. You can do it, B. Come on, Brandon. I can't hear you, Brandon. Come on, break that press. B, break that press. Call it out. Brandon, I can't hear you. Yo, are you fucking serious? Get off me! There's 3,000 people at Memorial screaming their heads off, and I don't know what set we're in! Fuck you! Can you hear me now? Can you? Yeah, I can hear you now. What's up, Coach? How'd you find my house? I looked you up on my phone. Oh. What do you want? Uh... So my momma, she works till 7:00 every night. And she was like, she doesn't want me really being out on my own after school. So she was wondering maybe if you'll let me back on the team. I already told you, Marcus. I don't want you on the team. If it's about finding something to do after school, I'll talk to Coach Dan. We can set you up with study hall or something like that. All right? Sorry. I thought that was a pretty fair offer, Marcus. My momma ain't sent me here, Coach. I'm here 'cause I wanna play ball. I miss it. I don't fucking like nothing else, Coach. Don't swear. There's a code of conduct policy at the school. - You know that? - My bad. There's a big section in there about swearing. I'm sorry. I won't swear. Be at practice tomorrow at 4:00. - You serious? - Don't be late. Ah, fuck no... I mean heck. I'm sorry. Heck no, I'm not gonna be late. I'm sorry about cursing, Coach. Let's go. Bring it in. - Oh, my gosh. - It wasn't me. A few things before we get started. As you can see, Marcus is rejoining the team. Judging by that reaction, I expect it'll be some time before he regains your respect. Second thing is, Sam and I discussed... we're gonna make a change to the captain spot. Brandon, you're gonna be our captain going forward. That's it. Get to work. All right, fellas. Let's go. Let's work. Let's hustle up. Let's do it. Good shit, B. I'll follow your lead. Come on. Every time that ball goes through the hoop, I'm gonna be thinking about you. - You know that? - Yeah. Yo, let's go. - Bro, what? - Come on. A'ight. I'll see you after. Okay? Bye, Kenny. All right, let's go. Move. What did we discover last night at Baptist? That defense creates offense. We have to maintain pressure for all four quarters. - That's right. - All right. Discovered that we're a pressing team. We don't take any plays off, we don't let 'em breathe. As soon as they get over half-court, we trap. Even if the ball's in the middle of the court? Anywhere and everywhere. You can't trap if the ball's in the middle of the floor. You need the sideline. Who says? We can do whatever we want. Get up! There you go. There you go. Stay with him! Pressure, pressure. Don't let him breathe. - There you go. - Trap, trap, trap! Bring it around. Stay on him. No! Bullshit! That's a chickenshit fucking call. God damn it! - I'm working on it. - Work harder. Come on! If we're gonna keep winning games, we gotta make our lack of size an advantage. We gotta speed the game up. We gotta play every possession like it's a war. Oh, come on! You've gotta be fucking blind! That's a horseshit call! We done yet, Coach? We're a pressing team. It's not even the third quarter. We're just getting warmed up. Motion, motion. What did we discover last night at Downey? We gotta take charges. We gotta play with chips on our shoulders. Play with a chip on your fucking shoulder. Goddamn right. Marcus. Come on, you're going in for Chubbs. Marcus, I want you to cover the inbound, okay? Big arms. Force him to pass into the corner. That's it! The little things add up. Let's do all the little things right. Loose ball gets us two points. Tip pass gets us to four. Steal gets us another two. Now we're at six. Turnover out of our press gets us to eight. All this shit adds up. Every box-out, every hustle, every loose ball, every trap. Put all that shit together, all of a sudden we're pretty fucking tough to beat. Hit that! - That's how we do it. - Got that candy-stroke. What quarter are we in, Coach? The fourth quarter. The other team's gassed. Let's see what we got left in the tank. Hayes, let's go! Bishop Hayes, let's go! Hayes, let's go! Bishop Hayes, let's go! Kenny. Coach, why you gotta do me like that, man? Good luck tonight, Kenny. What quarter are we in, Coach? Holy shit, look at that. We just went into overtime. What did we learn about ourselves last night? That we have to respect the game. That's right. Respect. Yo, Coach, how many more I got? Well, Kenny, it's not up to me. - Let's keep him moving. - Come on. Hey, y'all. How y'all gonna do me like that? I loved each and every one of you girls. - Have fun. - Bye, Kenny. - Hayley, you know I... - No, keep going. Girls, you're all in my heart. You each have your own little section. Hurry up! I'm going! - Bye! - Bye, Kenny. Hey. Hey. Ready? - Hi. - Angela! - Hi. - Oh, my goodness. So, the doctors are optimistic? So far, so good. Great. They told us, "Let him do all the things any normal kid would do." But you know what remission's like. Yeah. Living life waiting on pins and needles for the other shoe to drop. Spoke to Ethan lately? He called me a couple of times. I haven't gotten back to him. Andrew's not looking so good. And now they're, uh, talking about hospice. Jesus. Can I use a different bat, Dad? Pick any bat you want, son. But first say hello to Mr. Cunningham. - Hi, Mr. Cunningham. - Hey, how you doing, pal? Michael's dad. You remember Michael. Remember, we were in the hospital. - It's all right. - Halloween, we... No, no, no. We put you two in a wheelchair... and then we pushed you all around the hospital - collecting candy. - Mmm-hmm. Doctor was gonna kill you for that. - Yeah. - That was your idea. - Michael was Dracula. - That's right. He was Dracula. Who's ready to sing Happy Birthday? All right, buddy. Let's do this. Who wants cake? Whoo! - Cake, cake, cake. - It's cake time. Come on, son, let's go. Cake, cake, cake. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear David ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Hi, Michael. Please, Lord, look after my son. Please let him be happy. I miss you, pal. Thanks for coming to the party. I know Miguel and Sofia invite us 'cause they don't want us to feel excluded, but I just end up feeling like even more of an outcast. It's like I just get angry all over again. Look around at all the boys, and wish it was one of them, not Michael. Does that make me an awful person? I never stop being angry. I know you're suffering. Yeah, I'm suffering. And I miss my son. And I don't believe he's in a better place. I believe the best place for him was right here with you and me. Yeah. Home. We're both suffering. I don't know, Ang, you seem to be doing pretty good. A new job, fucking some rich guy while we're still married. Sorry. You could go to the library. They have a book club there every Friday. - The library? Really? - Yep. Would you go with me? - Well... - It's for senior women. For heaven's sakes, Kurt. I don't have a problem making friends. I don't. But it's just a whole new place. I've only been there a little while. Give me... Well, it's called a two-way street, though. - You gotta get out a little. - Uh... You think maybe it's time for a new shower curtain, Jack? No, I hadn't thought about it. Oh, well, you should, 'cause that thing smells. Anybody want a drink? - No. No. - I'm good. So, what does the scout report look like for the team today, Jack? Uh, well, they're struggling a little bit. Trinity has lost six in a row. They have one good shooter, TJ Edmonds, but Uncle Jack's team should win. And they kinda have to win. 'Cause if they don't win tonight, their next chance at getting into the playoffs is against Memorial. And Memorial's the number one ranked team in the state. You should see him, Jack. Every morning, the night after your game, he wakes up early, he goes downstairs, checks the stats on the computer. Maybe I should be the assistant coach tonight. Number 41. Get your head in the fucking game. Come on, Brandon. Let's go! Push up! Defense! All right. Motion, motion, motion. Don't stop. 41's the shooter. Watch the drop screen. Push it up. Let's go! Look out. Kenny! Playing with their heads up their fucking ass. They're just really nervous right now. These guys have never played a game that's ever mattered. One stop. No threes. Shit. - Switch up, switch up. - Defense! - Move! Move! - Defense! Here we go, here we go! Go! Come on, Kenny! That's stupid. It's the back court! - I know. - Yo, commit to the top. - We had an open player. - All right, all right. I know. Let's go! 22! 22! - Watch the screen! - No threes! - Any time-outs? - None. Push it, push it! Get through, get through, get through. Hayes, look up. Oh, that's bullshit. What's the call, Sal? Offensive foul, number 23. That's bullshit. He was moving his feet! - Offensive, number 23. - He was moving his feet. He was already set, Jack. You don't make that fucking call at the end of the game! - It's the end of the game! - His feet were set, Jack! It's a chickenshit call. - Come on. That's a pussy call. - Listen, that's a warning. And you're a fucking pussy for making it. All right, you know what? That's it. Fuck you. Hey, Jack. Jack! Technical foul, right here. You don't fucking decide the game! Okay? The players decide the fucking game. - That's bullshit. - Jack, Jack, Jack. You don't fucking do that now! The players decide the goddamn game! - Hey! - You've gotta calm down. Technical foul. You're outta here. ♪ Na na na na ♪ ♪ Na na na na Hey hey, goodbye ♪ Take a breath. ♪ Na na na na Na na na na ♪ ♪ Hey hey, goodbye ♪ Sorry for losing my temper tonight. I shouldn't have done that. You know what my dad told me last night? He said that you got a full ride to Kansas and that you just quit. No reason. Why? My father didn't like me very much. And then someone told him I was good at basketball and he paid a lot more attention to me. And the better I got, the more love he showed me. Then I realized it wasn't me that he loved... it was what I could do. So, you just quit playing as a "fuck you" to your dad? Yeah, I guess so. I made a lot of bad decisions, Brandon. I got a lot of regret. Went away from basketball, got into a different life, got into drugs. Spent a lot of time hurting myself, trying to hurt my father. It was my wife who got me outta that. I never picked up a basketball again. Yeah, go ahead and lower it in. Russ! Yo, Russ! You got a visitor. Yo! Dump that. Dump it! Let's go! All right. Back. Excuse me, are you Russ Durrett? Yeah, can I help you? Yeah, I'm Jack Cunningham. I coach your son over at Bishop Hayes. Get this tuna on the scale now. Yeah, man, I know who you are. Yeah, I used to come watch you play down at Cheviot Hills. You and Benny Green and YaYa Davis. Yeah, man. YaYa and Benny, man, we used to do our thing. So, how can I help you? Well, I want to talk to you about Brandon. Has he shown you any of the recruiting letters he's been getting? Brandon ain't shown me nothing. Well, he's getting a lot of attention from good schools that want him to come play ball for 'em. Thanks for coming by here and letting me know, Coach. How come we don't see you down at any of the games? 'Cause I got responsibilities at home. I got two boys that need to be bathed, fed, and helped with their homework. Well, we got a big game this week. If we win it, we go to the playoffs. Listen, I don't come to any games 'cause I don't support my son's ideas about the game, okay? I don't want him relying on basketball to make a life. That was my mistake and it ain't gonna be his. These schools are offering him full scholarships. Oh, come on, man. It don't matter. They offered me the same. Putting your faith in basketball, it don't work out. And if anybody ought to know that, it oughta be you. Yeah. Your son loves the game. He's gonna keep playing it. Let's do this! Let's go Bishop! Whoo! Let's go! It's the Tigers, baby! Let's do this, Hayes! Um... So, are we gonna stay in the press the whole game or... Yep, right from the tip. Okay. I'd better get the lineup out to the scores table. And, uh... I know nobody expected us to be here and we got no business winning this game, but I really want to beat these fucking guys. Come on, Coach Cunningham! We love you, Coach! - All right. - Let's fly. Coach. Let's go. Bring it in. All right. We're on Diamond press right from the tip. Keep that pressure up. They break it, fall back into 22. Look, you're nervous. I get that. The truth is, they got more talent over there than we do. Probably got a better coach. Nah. But I promise you, they are not a better team. I would take anyone on this bench right now, for any one of those players. You worked hard to be here, you earned this. Have some fun out there. Now go out there and earn the playoffs. All right, do it! Win on three. One, two, three... Win! Up! Up! - Get your man. - Hands up, hands up! Gonna eat us alive, if we give that shot. Push him to his left. Atlanta high, Atlanta high. Quick, quick! Switch, switch, switch! Get back, get back! That's it. Box out! Watch it! Watch it! Rebound! Switch up. Come down, come down, come down! - Corner, corner, corner. - Hey! Go, go, go! Help out! Time-out, time-out. Get up and yell "Bishop!" We need stops. So let's double-team Childress every time he comes across half-court. Make somebody else fucking score. Stay on him! Press! Pressure! Don't give up! Watch the pick. Pick left. Switch off to the side. Go! Let's go. Throw it in! That's it! That's it! Here we go, here we go. - Put it in there. - Go on, go on! You guys gotta move. You can't stand around. Switch, switch, switch, switch, switch. Let's go. Bring it through. - Here we go! - Pick him up. Pick him up. Look, we're not gonna make it all back in one possession. You gotta just keep chipping away, and chipping away at it. Watch him, watch him. Down the rail. - Up! - Come on. Come on. Little things, do the little things. Take it to the rack. That's you. Let's go, baby. Let's go, huh! Let's go, son. Yeah! There you go. All right. Up, up, up! - D-up, D-up. - Let's go. Get your man, get your man. Get up in their faces. Get in their face. Bobby, Bobby, watch this guy. Watch this... Let's get a trap! Pass it. Yeah! There you go! Too easy. That's too easy. Switch, switch. Get through it. Motion, motion. Here you go, here you go, here you go. Hey, coming through, coming through. Pick left, pick left. Go through, go through. Nice pass. Time-out! Time-out. Keep pressing, trapping, taking charges. Make our lack of size an advantage. Play like we've got a fucking chip on our shoulders. Let's go! Go, go, go. Lock up. Oh! Offensive! - Offensive. - Yeah! Come on! Jesus, you guys. We're playing right into their hands. Move the ball. Move the ball. Let's go! Diamond, Diamond, Diamond! Zach, he's six inches shorter than you. How does he make that shot? Chips on our fucking shoulders. Let's go! That! - Defense! - Stay on your man. That's it. Beautiful. I don't even know who I'm looking at. Go, go, go. Out! Ran out. You ran out. Get him, get him. - Hey, Diamond! Diamond! - D-up! - Pressure! - Come on, - break through. - Pressure! Reach. Shoot. Attack this. Attack their pressure! Switch, switch, switch. Come on! Box out. Twenty-two. Plot it out! Plot it out! That's it, that's it, that's it. That's it! Yeah, that's a great call. That is a bullshit call. How many time-outs do we have? - One time-out left. - His hands were all over 'em. - It's a home job. - All right. Time-out! Time-out. All right. Bring it in. Bring it in. - What's up? Say something. - Hey, hey, hey. Chill. Chill. - Bring it in. - Chill, man. Come on. What're you gonna do? I'm gonna run Atlanta for Brandon. But Childress is on him. You gotta expect a double-team. So, is he gonna get an open look? Yeah. All right. 12 seconds, no time-outs. We're gonna run the Hawk for Kenny. Marcus, set the high pick. Freeze, Garcia, come round, set a double screen. Brandon, go right, look for Kenny on the wing. Three, we're stopping three. He gets the ball, he doesn't go five feet. We lock him up. One stop. Stay focused, run our set. Get out there and win this. - Team on three. - Win on three. One, two, three... Win! Let's go, man! Let's do this. Brandon... Forget that. Take the shot. Don't nod your head at me. I got this. Hello? Hey, it's me. Hey. I just got off the phone with Miguel, and... What? - Hey. - Hey. What happened? A few weeks ago, he was hitting baseballs. Yeah, he, um... He had a fever at school. Sofia picked him up, and then he just started seizing. Is he conscious? He's sedated. Is he, uh, gonna be okay, or... They don't know. They did a scan this morning, they're just waiting on results now. No! No! No! I can't. I... I gotta go. Just wait. - Where are you going? - I gotta go. I gotta go. Come on. Come on. Just a few more. You should see my moves. They're better than my old man. Your old man didn't have moves. I used to carry him up the stairs. Got the key? Huh? Let's go. No. No, no, no. Give it here. There you go. Look at Marcus! Come on, man, I'm right here! Let's see the ball move, okay? - Double back to me. - Go, go, go! Snap it back through! Nice, Sam. Call 'em out! Call 'em out! Get through, get through. Come on, get through, get through. Nice, Kenny. - Come on. - Come on. - Hey, Jack. - Coach. Are you all right? Where you been? Yeah. Had a power outage in my, uh, neighborhood. Alarm didn't go off so... I overslept. I apologize. Bring it in. I had a power situation at my place. I overslept. That's on me, okay? Let's get into a Hawk set. Brandon, take the ball. Kenny and Garcia on the wing. Marcus and Freeze, start in the box. Yeah. Hey, Padre. How's it going? How are you, Jack? I'm all right. What can I do for ya? Jack, I'm afraid we're gonna have to ask you to step down from coaching the team. Why? It's come to my attention that you've brought alcohol around the players. We're gonna have to let you go. And I'm gonna need your office key. I'm worried that this might be part of a larger problem, Jack. Would that be true? You didn't want to just come talk to me? I did come talk to you about it, Jack, - and then you lied to me. - I never lied to you. I didn't lie to you about anything. You lied to me today about your alarm clock. I had a power outage at my house. - You were drunk at practice. - Oh, bullshit! - I could smell it on you. - Bullshit. The boys could smell it on you. Uh... All right, look... Let's just get to the playoffs, all right? Guys, please. Just don't do this. Okay? I had a bad night. And, I got it under control now and I can take care of it. Let's just, please... I'm asking you, please, okay? I'm sorry. Please, don't do it, do this. Jack, you've made this decision for me. I can't accept responsibility for allowing you to be around the boys anymore. You know... Fine. Look, please, just... Please, don't do this. Our decision is final, Jack. We have a zero-tolerance policy - when it comes to alcohol. - Fine. Fuck it. I tried to do something good with these kids. You know... It's your choice. Who's gonna coach the team? You? You're a fucking math teacher. I came to help you out. Look what we did. Tried to come in here and help you. You asked for my help. And I tried to help you. This is such bullshit. I can't get this fucking... I don't need this job. We are trying to help, Jack. You know what? Stick... What's this? From the blonde in the corner. Says she knows you. Another one from the blonde in the corner. Only this time it comes with a message... "Stop being a jerk-off and come over and talk to me." I think it's one of the Pearson girls from Saint Dorothy's. Yeah, I think it's Diane. I paid for you. I paid for the whole bar. You didn't pay for me. I mean, if everybody... Here, give me... Can I have a drag of that? - Mmm. - Please? God. Thank you. You know, I'll tell you a secret. - What? - Give me a kiss. No. You're driving. No. Fuck off. Yes, I am driving. Give me a kiss. Okay, just one. Just one. Just one. It's one kiss. My, God. Shit. Oh, God! Oh, shit. Shit! - This is my neighbor's house. - What? You've gotta go round the back. - Hurry up! Just go round the back... - All right. I'll meet you there. It's the third house on the right. Hello? Forget to pay the electricity bill? I think we made it. Think we're safe. Somebody's gonna come out for a fucking surprise, check their mailbox in the morning, find out their boat's fucking sunk. Pull your fucking pants up. My wife's calling the cops right now, asshole. Yes, my husband's speaking with him now. Diane's your wife? Who the fuck is Diane? I don't know. Who's... I'm in the wrong house, man. Oh, you're goddamn right, you're in the wrong house. Look, I'm sorry. I'm real sorry. I'm just gonna go home. Nah, you're not going anywhere. Sit down. Wait for the cops. Come on, sit down. Sit down! Hey! Okay? Can I get you anything? Did they tell you that they found you unconscious in the street? And that you broke into someone's house? Yeah. Just... You're gonna kill yourself if you keep going like this. That's why I'm gonna get you some help, okay? It has been decided that he will no longer be with the team due to personal issues that we'd rather not go into. I will step in as the interim coach. And I don't see why... During our family session... ...anything has to change. ...your sister and mother said that you've isolated yourself since Michael died. Would you agree with them? Yeah. I mean, I certainly don't see them as much as I used to. They also said you never talk about your son. I don't know what they want me to say. I could talk about the, uh, tumors in his brain and his spine. Thirty rounds of radiation. He used to scream when he had seizures. Nobody wants to hear that. We can't change the past, Jack. What we can do is choose how we move forward. Think about Michael. What would he want for you? Hi. Hey. Thanks for coming. Can I take your coat? - Have a seat. - Okay. How's it going? Good. Good. Good. I'm really glad you're here, Jack. Yeah. Me too. I shoulda come here a long time ago. I just want you to know that, uh, I know that I failed you. And I know that I failed our marriage. I failed our son 'cause I didn't take care of his mom. And I hope that, uh, one day you can see in me the man that, uh, that you once hoped I would be. I'm so sorry. Hello? Hey, Dan. How you doing? It's, uh... It's Jack. Heavenly Father, we welcome your presence here among us and your spirit of love alive in the community of Bishop Hayes. Please help us to be the best we can be. To strive not so much to win, but to play fairly and well. We ask this in your name, Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen! Hey, fellas, let's win this fucking game for Coach Cunningham, baby. I'll talk to him. Let's go. Bring it in. Bring it in. Bring it home. All right, we stay in press - all game, okay? - All right. Nobody gets past you. You stay in their faces, all right? Play with that chip on your shoulder, stay hungry. Who are we? - Hayes! - Who are we? - Hayes! - Right! Win on three. Let's go. One, two, three... Win! To the sharpshooter Dawes in the corner. He fires up a three and it's good! Hayes is hitting on all cylinders tonight. For a team that hasn't made the playoffs in 25 years, they seem to be awfully comfortable out there. Full-court pressure again from Hayes. Dougherty has just not been able to figure out the Hayes pressure. The defense has been absolutely suffocating. Sanders trapped in the corner. He fires across the court to Jenkins. Pass intercepted by Durrett! Brandon Durrett is gonna take it by himself. Reverse layup and it's good! - And he's fouled! - Wow! He has been really special today, hasn't he, Tom? He has been magnificent. And now Hayes is out to its biggest lead of the game. We said earlier that Coach Jack Cunningham, the man responsible for this amazing turnaround wasn't able to be on the bench today. But you have to imagine he'd be very proud of the way these boys are playing. I can remember watching Jack as a player. He was tough, intense, competitive, and he has instilled in these boys all those qualities that made him such a winner. And you can see Jack's imprint all over this team. Clearly a reflection of their coach. I have never seen a high school team with this much composure.
