Attack! Teacher Wong, in there is full of opium. Burn it! Cheng Tung Hoi. Here. You have undercover men working under Wang Hing But so far, your information is very inaccurate. This time the Black Dragon lost the opium. How should I tell my boss? I deserve to die. Boss. We acknowledge we have accidentally failed this time but that doesn't mean we should take it lightlyy, if our secret were exposed the Black Dragon organization cannot stand firm here Do you have any plans? How can you help here? I have someone who can do it. I have a killer of exceptional abilities, to kill Wang Hing Tin and his men. What is it? - Security check. Checking out? - Look! Whyjust me? Security Captain I check who I want. Stop checking! Stop checking! Well? No more checking? Fuck off! Lord, buy some. Need a rickshaw? - Gao Sing Inn. Gao Sing Inn Yes Please enter. Mr. Tse, our chief Qiao ha! Instruct us, reserve this space for you. Thanks. Just call me if you need something. Alright. We heard you had your way at the pier Our teacher Wang asked us to come and teach you a lesson. Who is this teacher Wang? If you do not speak, I'll cut off your ear. Take it back and ask your teacher Wang to come Wait! Wait! Do not be impulsive. That's enough! This man of mine is just arrived. If he was impertinent, forgive him please. Please put in a word for us. When you return to school. Please accept this sum money. Let's go. Please excuse me. Who are those assholesl? - Forget it. Besides, you can't do anything about it. Sit... Tell the waiter to bring food and wine. Yes. Brother Tse, you are a great friend. You must have left at once when you got my letter! This is! my home. I'll go home again. You said some people were causing you trouble is this the gang? Is it about the opium? This is along story. You were gone for more than ten years and know nothing. During this time the people have a lot of pressure. Why? It's all because of that Wang Hing Tin of the Kung To martial arts school They use their power to consort with corrupt officials to form the so-called protection society and control the piers, bullying our people and doing as they please Take me for example I didn't yield to their blackmail so they picked on my goods many times and accuse me of smuggling Damnll have been under severe oppression all these years! How do they do this! How? With power and fist of course. Damn. That is Why I asked to avenge our wrongs If you can get rid of these crooks, you will be richly rewarded. It is very important. By the way, I was in your debt. Now that you are being bullied could I stand by and watch? You're a true friend. Although your martial arts skills are strong Don't be rash. The Best way to destroy them Is work in secret. When you get rid of Wang Hing Tin and his three chiefs they will bejust a disorganized lot. No, a hero doesn't do things stealthily I'll go through the front door. Whom are you looking for? I'm Tse Chun and I'm here to talk to your Master Wang. He has returned to his village for private reasons. What is with your three superiors? They are not here right now. May I help you? No. Because I want to fight with them. It would be better if you would not fight. Hold it! Besides, I'm not in the mood to teach you a lesson Wait a minute! I know you! You're the guy who hit someone on the pier. Brother, our Kung To martial arts school never hurt anyone Can you be mistaken? Mistaken? That incident at the inn, and the fighting now It seems that I'm not to blame, but the name plate at the school. What's your problem!? IWill take the name of your school! What should I do?! Go to Yum's place and get our three masters! Yes The name plate of our school was destroyed. What? Stop! Why did you manage this? For no particular reason. The term, kung to "(fairness) pass! Not to your school. Do not move! So you came hereto make trouble? No, I've come to see how good your school is in bullying people Then I have to fight with you. If you don't I'll be disappointed Let's start. Wait for Master Chiu here, I'll go after him Follow! Uncle. What is the matter, Tung Mui? The Miss wants to go out, prepare the car. Hung Mm.. Yes? Prepare my blue dress for tonight Yes. - I'm going to sing Miss. I'll kill you! Stop! He is! Siao Fu, of which I have told you. Sister It's really you. Siao Fu. Careful. I still do not trust myself. It's ok, you've trained hard. Pluck up your courage. Do not be afraid. Do you still remember how we used to be? Yes, it is! More than ten years ago. You were gone for more than ten years. How did you feel the Whole time? So so. Sometimes here, sometimes there A wanderer. Do you still everyday like before. In this society you have to fight every day, because there are too many bad men around. Still the same martial temperament. No, I've changed, I'm not called Siao Fu my name is Tse Chun. Beautiful House. Yours? No, it belongs to the boss, for whom I work as a singer. Singer? After you were gone, Our circus was disrupted by corrupt officials. I've heard about it. I asked someone to find out where you were, but could not find either of you. Your were all gone. A Singer took me up, taught me to sing and gave me the name Yu Giao. So now I sing at Da Koon. Was Brother Ma still with you? He went one day after you went. He has also gone away? Yes. He left the day after you left Siao! I must leave! Whyl? Life in the circus is inconsistent. We can not get as many ticket buyers. Damn it! The high taxes of the corrupt officials were to blame. But I left this organization, for you and your sister. The three of us were happy when we were kids. But when we grew up, We seemed to be one too much. Two is company, three's a crowd. IWill find something else. It's the best for all of us. Promise me, after I leave, Take care of sister. I left him a letter when I left asking him to take care of you But then he went. Then you. He told me to tell you that you should take care of me when he left. It ended up that you both were gone. And I remained alone. I have took care of myself for more than seven years. Do you blame me? No, you're back, are you not? When did you come back? Yesterday. Because of me? Yes, you, and something else. Where did he go? This is the last place we saw him. Is that not the house of Yu Giao'? - Yes. Miss, men from the Kung-To-martial arts school are here, and they're pissed! Why? They want to find someone! Siao Hi, Did you fight the moment you came back? Do not worry, I'll drive them off! Don't make a scene! Go hide in back! Let me deal with this. Tung Miu, open the door! No. - Go in there. Master Chiu. - Exactly, young lady! Meisler Chiu, What are you doing here? Please come in. Please take a seat. Tung Mui, bring tea. - Yes. Take a seat. I think you're looking for someone, right? Right when we were not in school, someone named Tse destroyed the school's Sign. He's seriously injured our third brother. I only' found it when I returned with the second brother. They told me thatthey have lost this Tse here in the area. I'm worried he can be ajam. That's Why I came to see you. I am concerned he might be a menace to you Let's search the house. Right! Where else could he be? Where are your manners? This is! The house of Miss Yu Giao. If someone had come in, would not she have known? Yes. Master Chiu, if he is not satisfied better search everything. I can't bear the guilt of harbouring a criminal He is not a criminal, But there may' be a misunderstanding of our school. By the way, it is better to win friends than to make enemies. I just want to cite a few things with him. Now that you say you you saw no one, we will leave. Miss, thank you so much for your time. We will go. Still left, drink some lea. No, we have to go back and after the wounds of the third brother. Let's go! Well, goodbye, thank you. Let's go men. Thanks so much for your time. Uncle, get the door for them. Siao Fu, Why did you make trouble in the Kung To school? I have to teach this tyrant a doctrine. Who says they are tyrants? What do you know about this? I'll tell you later. I've got to do, I'm going now. See you tomorrow. Siao Fu. As soon as that Tse fellow came, he wrecked our place destroying our school and wounding our men, he bears a grudge against us. There must be a conspirarcy. What problem could he have with us? Mr. Wang, we have all the years of peace and have done nothing wrong. When Tse Chun has come to take attack, he must be a villain. Brother Chiu has right. He's solving other peoples' problems He is a hired assassin. Not necessarily. We don't even know who is smuggling dope How can we be sure with whom they are connected? In any case, we need to meet him again, find What he wants. Let's not be rash! Mr.Wang! Mr Ma of the provincial patrol is hereto see you Thanks. - Yes. Mr Ma. Master Wang. Please Come in. Thanks. Please, have a seat. What business do you have here? Hasl you got something? I've heard a band of Japanese is operating secretly here Master Wang, have you heard anything? As far as I know these mercenaries were terminated by us a few years ago This secret organization is called Black Dragon and is related to a big case I solved in the city Yes, they deal it, and never Show their faces. They not only sell drugs to make money, they have other intentions. - For real? You know better than I do, That's why' I want to ask you for help. It would be a pleasure for me to help! I'll not allow the Japanese mercenaries to operate illegally here Has anyone of interest shown up? Yes, but he's not a Japanese mercenary I am ashamed to say this person operates mysteriously his martial arts are strong Alright, a lead! What do you know about this guy? He came so cocky. He has been trouble ever since he arrived. As soon as he came, he started fighting the students and he smashed our schools name plaque and injured 3rd brother What's he like? We haven't figured him out We only know he is called Tse Chun Tse Chun? He is good with flying daggers He hurt brother with them. Brother, I've been thinking about the Whole thing. It is better when I go. You can much better take care of sister Siao Fu. Do not worry, I'll find him for you. Even if I have to go to the end of the world. Where is this man who has thrown the dagger? We can't seem to find him We chased him to the house of the singer. Then he disappeared. Singer? Miss. - What is? A man named Ma is! Here, he is going to see you. Brother Ma. Brother Ma! Brother Ma. Chiao Mai-Brother! Sister, it's you The beloved Yu Giao is my sister. Do not talk nonsense! You were gone for 10 years. Why are you back here? I'm coming with a task. I heard a man named Tse caused trouble and injured someone at the school. He has left his throwing knife. Chun? Siao Fu? What? Is Siao Fu really back there? He has changed his name to Tse Chun. Where is he now? I do not know. He came and left. Why has he gone against Wang Hing Tin'? I do not know But it is strange that he thinks Wang is a villain. Something is fishy here. How can we find him? I think there is a conspiracy here! Chun! Chun! An agent from the provincial government came today He probably wants to deal with you. They must know I hate corrupt officials most and have sent someone to die I'll handle it. Where is he now? I think they are this night at Ta Koon Lau. Could a stranger be conquered? I run out of my room. But I do not find anyone, everything is still. I can only see the willows moving in the wind. Birds smile at me, They mock my love. My waning causes more fear. I know, you two know each other. - We grew up together. Great. The evening dusk is here and it is soon dark. I can only find my love in my dreams. In my dreams... Sir, Master Wang needs you urgently at the pier. Please go sofon. I am interested, you can to be in love with me. Bravo! I think you're better at school. I will ask Guang Ouan to send after you when I need you. Let's go. Let's go back to school. Let me know if What happens. Yes. - Come on. Today something could happen. - Maybe. Wait. Sir, What tea do you want? - Anything will do, where's Yu Giao? Just resting. Can I ask you Whether somebody came to hear her singing? My friend Tse. Can I sit down and chat with you? You guys again, please sit What can I do for you? I'm Go Wu, top teacher of the Kung To Fighting School. I want to clarify' a thing: Why did you hurt our 3rd brother? And destroy the shield of our school? It's easy. Your school is not the one to be called "kung to" (fairness), attack! You are pushing it You can make the first move. Siao Fu! Why are you fighting here? This place is good as another. I just don't know Where Mr Go prefers to fight Right, we go outside. - You're welcome. Siao Fu. Wait, I'll be right back. Where's Chief Ma? - At the pier. Probably nothing will happen. I think a cargo of firearms could arrive here. Brother Ma. What is it? It's terrible, Siao Fu is fighting with Master Go Siao Fu. Why are you fighting Wang Hing Tin and his men? Since our circus was forced to disband I hate these corrupt officials through and through. They monopolize the water and the pier and oppress the people. How could someone live decently? Who has made these accusations? Never mind In any case, they operate in secret. What would you do? If I understand it properly, the government does not have enough troops, to control the area. That's Why Wang Hing Tin took over the task, so he could defend the people from these gangs. I also heard Wang Hing Tin has made great contributions to Fang Kang But have you heard of corruption and actions of tyranny? Have you heard of the corruption and violence? Who says they are corrupt? Also... Siao Fu, every official is at the risk of causing displeasure maybe the one who talked to you intentionally defamed Wang Hing Tin And you were misled by them. He is right, the reputation of the Kung To combat sports school is good. So it's all my fault I can not say that, too, but you must find the truth and decide who is wrong and who is right. You can't act on hear-say You must also understand What sort of person it is who is talking to you It's never too late to make things right. Brother Ma has right You're too hasty. Alright, I'll make investigations but if Wang Hing Tin is as bad as I think he is I'll not let him go At that time I hope you'll stay out of it Don't worry, if they are villains I'll deal with them with you Right, it's a deal When did I ever lie to you? But before the matter is clarified But until the case is cleared, you better come in here so you do not have to worry about sister. Secondly, itwouldn'tbe nice if after the first escape you have to make another escape, right? Brother, here you go again Miss, the food is ready! The food is ready! Perfect timing! Let's toast to our reunion Cheers! Mr Tse, you're back - I am checking out at once Waiter! - Coming! What can I do for you? Hand this letter to Boss Qiao My address is inside If he needs me, he can find me there. Yes. - Thank you. - With pleasure. Forge ten of these flying knives. The same design as this one. Just like this one? Exactly! No one can tell the secret of the Black Dragon. When do you want them? - Tomorrow morning! Brother. Master Cheng, What is it? Nothing, I want to kill you four. Siao Wang! Put the knives in their bodies, before anyone comes. Right! What? These four daggers all come from their bodies? Chief Ma, because Tse Chun is your friend we gave him some room, even when he smashed the shield and violated the third brother. But now he has killed our young students, we can not tolerate him. Master Chiu, Tse Chun is a true man. I guarantee that he would not do such a thing. Do you think we framed him? - Wait! Inspector Ma, something stinks here. Only Tse Chun has such knives, and no one can copy his technique. It's true these are the daggers he uses but they can't prove he killed these men So What proof do you have, which prove that he did not have them? Sister, these are the happiest days which I had in all these years. For me too. I Wish they never end, will never end. Do you remember how we used to come here and pick lotus flowers? Of course, I remember, I almost drowned that day. These days were so beautiful. Will not the next days be beautiful as well? Even more beautiful Really, you will stay? I'll be with you always starting today Sister To watch the water lily' blossom in summer and the Willow become green in spring Siao Fu. Sister Siao Fu. Siao Fu! What is it, brother? A few people were killed at the school last night Your knives found on their bodies. - What? Nowthey all think you did it You better get along with me to clarify the case. I didn't do it! Why should I go with you? The same old temperament. Murder is not a small reason. So What? I didn't do it Siao Fu, if you do not tell them, How do you know you're not? No need! Mr Wang knew he wouldn't come That is Why he has told us to come instead. What do you want? We want to know What happened last night. Sorry, but I don't know What happened. Not my problem. What about those daggers? If you want to attach this to me, you can make a few knives and put them in the bodies. Attack! Don't move! Don't Move! Brother Tse, What you said was unacceptable You attack for no reason, isn't that also unacceptable? I think the Whole thing is a frame up Tse Chun would not commit murder. How can you prove that? I mean What I say That's all the proof you need Looks like we have to fight then. Siao Fu, you can not... Brother, when I say I have not done it, then I have not done it. We must not waste more time. The favor I owe to you, I will return it later. I must go now! Siao Fu. Brother, what's going on? I've checked it, a knife is missing. Could anyone have done it in the guesthouse? Unlikely, the waiters are innocent. In addition, they have no use forihe knives. Who stole my daggers and killed those people last night? What is even stranger? Could one knife kill so many men? Someone must have stolen your knife and imitated it. This person must also be very versatile in imitation. I heard that night Chief Ma also fought, could it be... No. I also think you both are in love with Miss Yu Giao. Would he bejealous so he framed you? Impossible We are like Brothers. He would not do anything like that. Your friendship ten years ago, she could have changed. Besides, didn'tyou say no official is a good person? No. Friendship is built on trust. If he is unrighteous to you, you can also be against him. Be quiet! For one thing, there is no proof that Brother Ma isjealous. On the other hand, if he wants to marry Yu Giao, I can not help it anyway. Did not you say' you love her? In fact, I love them too much. Forget it. Forget it. The best thing I can do now, is leave her to him. Qiao, I'm sorry, I did not finish the task that you have given me. I will give you the favor I owe you on another day. That's fine! No big deal! I need to ask you, I still have to trouble you to accommodate me tonight at the inn Fine, fine! We'll meet again. Boss, it's too easy to let that Tse fellow off Not that easy' I know Wang Hing Tin is looking for him Let him know, then they will fight. All our problems solved. “Flasher Chm Masher Chm.. Tung Hoi, What is it?! I heard that Tse fellow is staying at the Gao Sing Inn Let us surround him, and then we'll arrest him. Let's go. - Wait! Neither Mr Wang nor Chief Ma is here. Let us consider their return and talk to them before we act. I am afraid by that time he would have gone Let us inform Brother Ma, while we surround him at the same time. What is ill? Why are you here? Where does he live? - Follow me. Here it is. Getup! If I hadn't wanted to ask I would have killed you Do not move! Master Chiu, What do you want from me, to this late hour? I come because of those who died in my school. This is none of my business Whose knives were they? I do not know. - Only yoursl! Follow! Stop it! I need to revenge the death of our brothers. So I have to kill. Shut up and fight then! Follow! Come down! It's a disaster! Master Chiu was killed by a flying knife. Master Chiu. It's you! Hide yourself tonight and come to get tickets for the boat tomorrow MasterChiu. - Who has killed to him? Tse Chun has his flying knives What I? Sister, has Siao Fu come? No, what happened? He just killed Master Chiu. Where has he gone? Could he have returned to his old hiding place? Brother? Yes, it's me. What's wrong? This is the knife you used to kill Master Chiu. The blood is still not dry. Mum Teacher Ch'm? This time they saw it with their own eyes. I have not killed Master Chiu. You still want to deny it? Brother, What do you want? - I have to take you back. Why do not you let me speak? Go back with me and talk to them. I have not done anything wrong. Why should I go with you? You have to! Why? I only do my duty. Oh, I forgot about that. You are now an official. I'd better not mention our friendship Everything should be official. No wonder Qiao Ji Fei said now that you're an official You had to change. What do you mean? I just wanna ask you. You insist I killed these people, do you have an agenda? You want to drive me from here, Do you have an agenda? Siao Fu How can you speak like this? And Why not? If you never listen, Why should I trust you? You... Brother, Do not force me to kill. I do not force you either. Don't force me either! It seems as if you are doing your duty And I'm gonna fool myself. Before the law are all equal. How can we prove it? Unless you come with me? What if I don't? This ends now! Go now! In Wu Sins Pavilion I have owed you my life, I give it back. In my eyes, you are still amurderer. I'll grab you when I have the chance. Now we're even Let's see What happens when we meet again I never thought that our friendships would end here. After all these years Why? If I have not done wrong, Why do not I explain the other side? I have suffered enough these years what's left is my pride I've done nothing wrong, no one can blame me. What will become of me now? You have to move on again? I'm a hiker... and must move again. And again. But you promised Time to go. Siao Fu, you promised to be with me? To watch the lily' blossom in summer and the Willow become green in spring Wasn't that What you said? Forget it! Come with me. Today here, tomorrow there. Move with you? Why can not we be smoother? Couldn't we be happier? Tomorrow's day will see us go the path. Will you stay for my sake? Along time ago, brother said when we were together. We three were young and happy When we became older, it seemed we were one too much. That '5 Why you have Brother Ma to take care of me when you left. But Why didn't you ask me who I wanted to be with? Honestly, there is no one I'd rather spend my life with. Tomorrow I must leave again I wanted us to be together but fate has been against us And I do not know when I will return. Sol better not wait. Don't wait for me. It'll soon be bright, you'd rather rest. When do you go? I do not know yet. I need to get my ticket to the ship soon. Mr Qiao. Mr Qiao! Brother Tse, What do you want so early in the morning? No big deal, I'm hereto get my tickets. Ah, certainly, certainly! I've been thinking about it all night. It is! Better for you, if you are on a small boulder the river. Why? I have always done everything openly. Why should I secretly disappear? I did not mean it like that! Wang Hing Tin and Chef Wa guard the pier. It will be difficult to get on board. It is in your interest, this way you won't have to try and fight your way through. Or can you think of a better way? Well done. Great planning. Right, at the second watch tonight I'll wait for you there See you. Cheng Tung Hoi. - Yes? Execute my plan at once Big trouble! I have heard that this guy Tse will flee tomorrow on the river. Damn, let's go. Once they hear the news they'll ambush him Then our stuff will be safe and can be taken from the pier. You are smart So we kill two birds with one stone. When Tse Chun enters the night at the meeting point, We have no more worries. Strange, no people and no boat. Who says there are no people here? You want to sneak away? Attack! Ma Yi, you have so many men to help. In my eyes, you are still amurderer! Chief Ma, this is a matter of our school. Let me handle him! My fighting rod Yes. Mister Wang. - What? Come to the pier. The Japanese are leading smuggled goods. What? Tse Chun, What a nice change. It seems as if he were working for the organization of the Black Dragon. Siao Fu, you have become a Traitor Watch What you say. Do not pay attention to him. Let's go to the pier. I leave you to your poor life. Be quiet, I always make everything open. IWill not go until the case is cleared. Fine, then we'll meet again. How should I tell my superiors that I lost these weapons? The only way is to get rid of Tse Chun and Ma Yi, before they cover us. You! What more do you have to say! The only way is to get rid of Tse Chun and Ma Yi before they discover us Then we'll deal with Wang Hing Tin Do it now!! Yes boss! Yesl! Let's gel! You have guts for a traitor I thought you were gone! We don't owe each other Be careful What you say Not for your kind. Today I will be getting rid of trailers to our country. Stop! Damn, that's a setup! Thank you for coming to my aid, but this is between brothers Do not get involved. You're wrong. We from the Black Dragons are hereto get rid of both of you. What?
