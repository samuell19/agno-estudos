I have wounded you deeply. What did you feel at that moment? Sadness... Or maybe hate? No matter how deeply I regret it, I cannot find an answer. Still, all I can do is continue to look for you. The one I met that spring, my love like the falling petals. The cherry blossoms are blooming. They sure are. They'll peak next week. It's already flower-watching season. I was so busy, I didn't notice it's spring. It'll rain the week after next, so next week is best. - Next week? - Yes. Do you have any plans for the holiday? Not at all. Are you busy as always? Oh, not really. It's so cool that you're a professional photographer. What kind of photos are you taking now? Well... Let me guess. Cherry blossoms? Yes. - Oh, wow. - Cherry blossoms... That's lovely. Oh, yeah. Would you like to come with me... - What are you doing? Get a towel! - Okay! Are you okay? - Do we have ice? - Yes. - Where? - In the back. - I'm so sorry! - Are you okay? You were crying. Over my measly earlobe. I first met you six months before that. It was a day like any other. I'm Misaki Ariake, and I'll be your hairdresser today. Lured in with a coupon, I was sitting there, totally lost, when you appeared. How would you like it done? Huh? I'll leave it to you. As you wish. What do you think? It looks... A lot neater than usual. What a relief! To tell the truth, my heart was pounding. You see, you just happen to be my very first customer. You smiled with your whole face. After that, I went to Penny Lane once a month. Did you know? - You have two small whirls in your hair. - Yeah. They say people with two whirls are born geniuses. Little by little, we started talking more. When you mentioned a movie you liked, I'd watch it several times before my next appointment. When I learned you were single, I was so happy I went to the park and spun the jungle gym for the first time in ages. Let me guess. Cherry blossoms? Yes. Finally, when I worked up the courage to ask you out... Oh, yeah. Would you like to come with me... I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. Don't worry about it. It was because I turned... No, it was my fault! I'll pay your medical bills and for any damages. I'll do anything you want. Anything? Yes. In that case... Would you watch the cherry blossoms with me? Go out with me. ARIAKE Tell me that earlobe boy's number. I'll hunt him down, chop off his other earlobe and turn it into mincemeat! Stop it! Don't talk about that while I'm eating something that looks like an ear! Anyway, you must go apologize to him. Don't be silly. If he says he's okay, then he's okay. I've broken so many bones... That's because you were weak and lost in the fourth round. I told you, it was the eighth round. Don't start with that again! I already promised to do anything. You stay out of it. He can't stay out of it, Misaki. Ever since your parents passed away, he thinks of himself as a father to you. Right? He just can't help it, Misaki. I'm grateful for him, but he can be a bit much. - She told him. - You've been drinking too much. Don't open our altar without permission. I have to ask, why are you dating Takashi? You're pretty, and you work at a cosmetics company developing new products. What do you see in him? Excuse me? I think it's nice, though. Huh? - Oh, no! - Really? Seriously? I meant dating that up and coming photographer. Huh? I don't think of it as a date. It's just compensation for the damages. - Compensation? - For the damages? What? The longer you're out of the game, the harder it is to get back in. Mind your own business, dammit. How about you? I've got nothing to worry about! - Really? - I'd like to pay, please! I'm so sorry for the trouble I've caused. If you make a mistake at work, you have to work it off. Got it? Yes. Then let's get to work. - Let's do our best. - Okay. Okay, get ready. - Right. - Right. Oh, no, another one. What? A gray hair? I'm getting them a lot lately. I'll cut it for you. I might need to dye it. It must be due to stress. Yeah, this job is a nightmare. You got that right! About the date. Sorry for contacting you this late. It's me, Haruto Asakura. Can I have the check, please? I'm sorry. About the date we agreed on the other day, I wish to have it on Tuesday next week, in accordance with your schedule. Let's meet at 11:00 a.m., at the south exit of Shinjuku Station. Please note that I do not mean the Southern Terrace, but... "I look forward to seeing you." Wow. He is being way too formal. MISAKI ARIAKE Understood. I look forward - to seeing you too. - All right! I would love to assist you in taking photographs. I had to apologize for lying to her. Becoming a photographer was my dream. When I graduated high school, my father gave me a Nikon F3, which I held on to like a golden ticket, as I made my way to Tokyo. Tokyo Tower struck me as pompous. - Sorry! - And the crowds nearly scared me away. But I was thrilled to be taking photos in the city of my dreams. That was my first photograph. However... You'll ruin the shot like that, idiot! Think! Pay attention, dammit! Forget it. Makoto, you do it. Okay. - Go set up the monitor. - Sorry. I made it into a photo studio as an intern. - Testing! - But the work was harder than I imagined. Asakura. - And I felt less talented than the others. - This cable is broken. Okay. See you. Goodbye. I quit within a year. - Yeah! - Awesome! - That was great! - Yeah! After that, I bounced between part-time jobs. I told myself I was simply recharging my batteries. It was just a temporary break. Until my heart once again wanted to press the shutter button. I'm Misaki Ariake, and I'll be your hairdresser today. How would you like it done? That was when I met you. Seeing you cut my hair, being so nervous, reminded me of my past self. By the way, what do you do? Well... I... take photos. - Photos? - Yes. You're a photographer? Well, yes. - Wow! - I'm just starting out. That's so cool. You're not taking any photos? Oh, well... What about you? What made you want to become a hairdresser? Oh, well... You see... It's because I can use magic. Magic? Actually, I have naturally curly hair. In school, everyone called me "Curly." I was so insecure about it. But in the summer of ninth grade, Ayano, my brother's girlfriend, took me to a salon. I straightened my hair for the first time. Just like that, all my troubles disappeared. My hair was perfectly straight. When I saw myself in the mirror, I was so moved I almost cried. It really was like magic. That's when I decided. I would be a hairdresser and use my magic so that my customers could look at themselves and feel cute. Why did you become a photographer? Well... I'm not a photographer. Huh? I... lied to you. But it is true that I wanted to be a photographer. I thought I had talent. But my boss always yelled at me, and I was no good at my job. I lost confidence and ran away. And now... I work at a karaoke bar. Why... did you lie about that? I didn't want you to dislike me. I wasn't that serious at first. But you seemed too excited, I didn't want to let you down. - So I kept lying... - What the hell? You think I'm the type who judges people by their profession? That I was excited to meet a photographer? - No. I didn't mean... - I mean, yeah... I did think it was kind of cool. But hearing you say that really ticks me off. You're saying you gave up on your dream without even trying? No way! You thought you had talent, right? So why did you quit? - Sorry... - Don't apologize! Why won't you fight for it? You can't just abandon your dream because it's hard! Pick up the camera again! Excuse me. Misaki! I want to change! I don't want to run anymore. I want to be proud of myself. So I'll change. I'll change into someone you'll like. That's it? You haven't heard from him since? Not a word. So what? In the meantime, you've turned 25. Well, darn. If I'd known, I would have picked a different present. Thanks for the flowery dress, anyway. "My first customer." Last summer, you were always talking so happily about your first customer. Through the fall and winter too. - Welcome. - Welcome. May I ask your age? - I'm 20. - I see. - Your hair is so pretty. - Thank you. I want to change! I'll change into someone you'll like. Let's eat. The petals are falling already. Let's see here. It's been a while. It's Asakura. Sorry I haven't kept in touch. You don't have to apologize. What do you want? Well... actually, I just got my first paycheck. Your first paycheck? I went back to work at the photo studio. The strobe doesn't go there! - I'll shove the tripod down your throat! - Sorry. - Not in the center! Off to the side! - Got it. I wanted to tell you sooner but decided to wait until I got paid. I owe it all to you. I want to thank you. Let me take you out to dinner. My treat. Okay. All right! Huh? What is this? Why? Huh? Homard de Breton, Éspuma Américaine. Enjoy your meal. "Homard de Breton." "Éspuma Américaine..." I'm sorry. To be honest, I'm not used to this kind of restaurant. I'm the one who should apologize. I... left a scar. On your ear. It's okay. It doesn't hurt. To me, it's a precious memento. This is where I work. KYOSUKE SAWAI My mentor, Kyosuke Sawai, is a famous photographer in the advertisement industry. Wow! That's so cool! A camera is a magical tool. When I was a child, my dad let me take photos with his single-lens reflex camera. Photos of the sky, clouds, bugs, and stuff. I thought cameras were so awesome. They're magical tools that capture moments and preserve them forever. You were just like me. Magic. Yes. It's so good! This strawberry jelly is great! I've loved strawberry jelly since I was a child. Your birthday was in April, right? You told me when I got a haircut last time. Oh, but... A scissor case? I thought it might be your color. My color? Your smile is just like... cherry blossoms in full bloom. One day, I'll make the lie come true. Huh? I'll study hard and improve my skills. So when I finally take a great photo, I'd like you to see it. Why me? I'm not a very special woman. Women like me are a dime a dozen. I've got a pretty rough personality, and I raise my voice when I'm angry. I still want it to be you. When I watched you cut my hair, I always thought, "What am I doing with my life?" I should have taken my work more seriously. I'm... glad I fell in love with you. Wait... that was really corny, wasn't it? I'm sorry. Well... take care. Well... Can I have some time to think? Huh? Can you give me some time to think about what you said back there? Please board now. This is the last train for Kamata. This is the last... Oh, dammit! Huh? What? Misaki. Misaki! Asakura! I... I want to fall in love with you too! So... if you don't mind, please be my boyfriend! Welcome home! What have we here? Have you been on a date? - Huh? - What's wrong? She looks cute. It's the dress I gave you! Where have you been? Who is he? He said he loves me. - Huh? - What? What did you say? Is it that BS artist photographer? - Hang on a moment! - I couldn't hear! - Ready? - Okay. - I'll lift this first. - Okay. - Asakura. - Yes? You're supposed to assist Mr. Sawai next. Takanashi said so. Huh? He never gets angry at people without potential. The more he yells at you, the more he recognizes your talent. It's going up! Going up! I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT TONIGHT. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO? I WANT TO GO TO A PLACE YOU RECOMMEND. That's good! MY MUSCLES GOT REALLY SORE. MINE TOO. IT HURTS TO EVEN HOLD THE SCISSORS AND I NEARLY CUT SOMEONE'S EAR AGAIN. MAYBE YOU'LL BE ASKED OUT AGAIN. WHAT SHOULD I DO? THERE'S A PLACE I WANT TO GO. OK, LET'S GO! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SHOP AT USED CLOTHES STORES. YOU BET I DO! MOSTLY BECAUSE I'M POOR, BUT, YOU KNOW... YOU ALWAYS LOOK SO STYLISH, I NEVER SUSPECTED. I MIGHT BE CONVERTED! THERE'S A SALE SOON. LET'S GO TOGETHER! I CAN LEAVE EARLY TODAY. WANT TO SEE A MOVIE? OKAY. BUT I MIGHT BE A LITTLE LATE. See you. Here's the salad. LET'S GO OUT TO EAT BEFORE THE MOVIE. SURE! - You know what? - What? I almost never go out to eat. - Really? - Yeah. When I go out to eat, my brother gets mad at me. Why? I don't know, it's so weird. Maybe he's jealous or something. What? YOU FELL ASLEEP AGAIN. NEXT TIME, I'LL MAKE IT TO THE END! I WANT A REWARD IF I MAKE IT! A REWARD? I WANT TO PULL AN ALL-NIGHTER! - It's that way! - No, it isn't! - This way? - This way. Are we going to be on time? Thanks, I got it. I'll go sort out the photos. - Okay. - Thanks. - Can you open that? - Okay. - I'll take this. - Okay, go ahead. SORRY. I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY. I GOT A FEVER AGAIN. We're unloading everything, right? BUT IT'S NOT TOO SERIOUS. GOOD LUCK AT WORK, HARUTO! WHAT? I'LL COME TO SEE YOU! WE'RE ALMOST DONE PACKING UP HERE. I'LL RIDE MY BIKE TO YOUR PLACE! Oh, crap! Come on! Yes? Well... Nice to meet you. I'm Haruto Asakura. I came to check in on Misaki. Could you give her this? Hey, you! You're the earlobe guy! Huh? Hitting on Misaki, are you? - Are you? - Hey, stop it! Shut up! Hello. I'm Misaki's sister-in-law... - This is Ayano. - I'm Ayano. - And that's my brother. - I see. - Don't let him in! - Back off. If you've got time to fool around, you should go to the hospital! I went to the clinic, and they said it was a cold. Go to the university hospital. Stop worrying, it's just a slight fever! - Out of my way. - Sorry about this. You're being too dramatic. You should apologize for his wound first! Sorry. I'm sorry. Out of consideration for your terrible injury, I'll let you have one round. Exactly three minutes. Got it? Yes. Thank you so much. Why are you thanking me? Sorry. Wait a minute. - I'm almost done cleaning up. - Okay. Haruto! You can come in now. End of the line. I'm not letting you into her room. I understand. Ouch... Sorry to keep you waiting. Please, come in. What's wrong? I'll stay out here. Okay, then. How are you feeling? - I brought you this. - Oh? Hey, strawberry jelly! Thank you. Is your throat sore? Do you have a cough? I should have bought cough drops... No! That's not why I'm wearing a mask. I'm not wearing makeup. I look like a child without makeup. I don't mind. In fact, I want to see it. No way. I don't want to infect you. And if you saw me up close, you'd laugh. No, I won't. I swear. That's not going to help. No, really. I won't laugh. Are you sure? I swear on my earlobe. Okay, then. Say something. You're beautiful. This is so embarrassing. - No, don't! - Huh? I can't? - Absolutely not! - Why? I look so pale and sickly. But... Thank you. No one's ever said I'm beautiful before. It made me happy. If you kiss her, I'll kill you. - Sorry! - The bell just rang, champ. - Okay. - Misaki, we're going to the hospital. - What were you doing? - I'm sorry. - Downstairs! - Yes, I'm going. HARUTO ASAKURA Hello? Sorry about my brother. - As soon as I get better... - Could you come to the window? The window? Yes. Get well soon. Yeah. Once you get well, we'll see the fireworks... Hey, Misaki! - Get a move on! - Wait! Sorry. What were you saying? Fireworks? Yeah, let's go. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah. - See you soon. - Yeah. Take care. It hurts! It hurts! It hurts so much! It hurts! Takashi! I'm Dr. Kamiya, a medical specialist in the field of genetic disorders. I'll get straight to the point. Misaki, you may be suffering from progeroid syndrome. Progeroid syndrome? We won't know for sure until we conduct a thorough examination, but the signs are there. What the hell is this "progeroid" thing? Once it starts, you will immediately see an increase in gray hairs and wrinkles, discoloration and hardening of the skin, and cataracts. Other symptoms include bones and muscles becoming frail. As the condition progresses, in addition to visible changes, the immune system weakens, and malignant tumors may occur. In other words, the risk of cancer increases. Wait. I'm not sure I follow. To put it simply, it's a disease that makes you age faster than normal. There are several kinds of progeroid syndromes. In your case, you might age dozens of times faster than an average person. Dozens of times faster? Once it sets in, it may only be a year before you become elderly. That's ridiculous! I've never heard of a disease like that! My sister has been perfectly healthy her whole life. She's never been seriously ill. Takashi. This is just hypothetical, right? You could be wrong. In order to find out if I'm wrong, I need to examine your genes. "Only a few rare cases are known." "It can be likened to... living life... on fast-forward." SYMPTOMS OF PROGEROID SYNDROME DIAGNOSING PROGEROID SYNDROME SIX MONTHS AFTER ONSET No way. This can't be true! - Unbelievable. - What? You're really going? What about the test results? The fever is gone. I'll be fine. Hey, did you know? - What? - About today's horoscope. It advised staying inside. You don't read the horoscope! Thanks for caring, though. But... I don't want to make Haruto worried. - Have fun, then. - Yeah. - Hey! - What? Don't stay out too late. Excuse me. KATASE-ENOSHIMA STATION THE SHONAN-ENOSHIMA FIREWORKS DISPLAY IS CANCELED. - This is good. - Yeah, it's great. - Haruto! - Yes? Look! It cleared up! It cleared up! I wanted to see the fireworks. Misaki! Huh? - Oh! - It's so fast! - Whoa! - Look! There it is! Careful! Hey, wait! It's over! - Whoa! - This is great! - Look! - Fireworks! - Get the lighter. - Hey there! - You want to try? - Can we? - I want to do it! - Okay. Here you go. - Over here! - Wait! This way! Come over here. - Is it lit? - Yeah! Help the others light theirs. Good. Everyone got a light? They're so cute. In your case, you might age dozens of times faster than an average person. SIX MONTHS AFTER ONSET Misaki. Will you marry me? What? I mean... It doesn't have to be right away. We both have our own dreams. But... I want to... share a life with you. I want to be with you forever. What's this all of a sudden? We've only been dating for three months. You're going too fast. Maybe you'll meet someone better than me. I don't care. I want to be with you. Even if it's only been three months. You're the last girlfriend I'll ever have. That's how I think of you. So I want to be with you. For years and years... The results are in. Misaki. Your condition is one of the most severe. It's called Fast-Forward Syndrome. We don't have a reliable method for treating it. Since we found it at an early stage, we will support you in any way we can to alleviate your condition. So... will I grow old before my time... and then die? Not only can't I make people pretty with magic, but now I'm going to turn ugly myself. Thank you for everything. I see. NAN'EI APARTMENTS Here we go. Huh? Sorry for stopping by unannounced. Is something wrong? It's nothing. I just thought I'd surprise you. It's pretty cramped, but do you want to come in? Yeah. Come in. Thank you. Sorry for the mess. I'll clean up right away. I got some tea from the caretaker. A magic tool... that captures a moment forever. What? I want to take some photos. - Tuck your elbows in. - Okay. - Like this. - Is it in focus? I think so. - Here I go! - Okay. - Is it good? - It's so pretty. Oh, you're right. You already took it? - Try standing in the shade. - Okay. Then photograph the flowers in the sun. Yeah, that's good. Huh? There's only one left. Let's take it together. Huh? - I already took it! - Seriously? Let me take at least one photo of you. Hey, Haruto. Yes? About your proposal the other day... It's okay. What? Maybe I was going too fast. I'll wait until I'm a full-fledged photographer. I'll work hard to become one so that one day, you'll say "yes." Even if it takes two years, or three. Or five. Show me someday, okay? When you've taken a great photograph. Yeah. It's a promise. I promise. All right, I'm staying the night at your place! What? All of a sudden? I mean, I'm all for it, but... your brother will kill me... Please. I don't have any. What? I don't have any condoms. That's okay. What's the matter? Haruto... Misaki... I wish we could have grown old together. Goodbye... Haruto. I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU IN THREE WEEKS. I'M WORRIED. PLEASE SAY SOMETHING, ANYTHING. PLEASE RESPOND. WHAT HAPPENED? PLEASE TELL ME. WITHOUT WORD FROM YOU, I'M WORRIED YOU'VE HAD AN ACCIDENT. SORRY FOR SPAMMING. I'LL BE WAITING. Ariake quit her job last month. She quit? She said she's going to work at a friend's salon in Harajuku. Which salon is that? She didn't tell anyone. I'm sorry. You always asked for her to cut your hair. Don't ask me. I don't know. If she's not texting you back, that means only one thing. What do you mean? She doesn't want to see you. That can't be... Please let me see her. She's not here. Now get out of here. Don't come back. Misaki? Misaki? Misaki! Misaki! Misaki! SHOWA-INARI SHRINE - Hello. - Oh, hello. You don't know when to quit. Move! She taught me to never give up. Please. At least give her this. I'm coming in. He left this for you. I think you should give him closure. TO MISAKI. I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU. PLEASE CALL ME. I'll take this side. Wait for my signal. Okay. MISAKI ARIAKE Asakura, raise it. Asakura! Hello? Thank you for the photo. I've met someone else. Huh? My ex-boyfriend, who was one of my old classmates, opened a salon in Harajuku. He asked me to work there. He broke up with me once, but I've always loved him. I'm living with him now. You're lying. That's not true. You can't just drop that on me. Hello. I'm Kamiya, Misaki's boyfriend. I'm sorry things turned out this way. But, she wants to be with me. Put Misaki back on. I'm sorry, Haruto. Let me see you. Let's talk this out. I'll go anywhere. I can't see you anymore. Why not? He won't like it. What the hell does that mean? How can you be so selfish? You're back with your ex and now you won't see me? Give me a break! That's bullshit! You're a terrible person. I don't care what you think of me. Please, Haruto... I want you... to forget about me. I'm sorry for asking you to do this. Thank you. Are you sure this is what you wanted? Yes. You idiot! How could you forget to charge the battery? Mr. Sawai is going to use this! I don't care if your girlfriend dumped you. Don't bring your personal shit to the workplace. Huh? Be professional, dammit. I'm sorry. I'll let you know when we're ready to start. Sorry for the inconvenience. Haruto Asakura, was it? What do you want to do with your life? What? Takanashi will open a private exhibition in February. Makoto has been getting more commissions for online ads. They're both trying hard to make something of themselves. What kind of photographs do you want to take? I should have... let him take at least one photo of me. What a silly way to get dumped! But you know, it's not unusual to fall for someone who loves someone else. It's the same with me. What? Really? Well, enough about me. They do say that people's hearts are as fickle as falling flower petals. You should just forget about her. I don't know if I can. Do you want me to help you? What? HEMI KOSODATE-JIZO Will electromagnetic wave therapy really work? Yeah. They said it would activate the cells, right? These people can cure any disease. They're famous for it. You can quit whenever you want to. It must be better than taking that shot for "osteoporosis" or whatever. Please close your eyes. HEMI KOSODATE-JIZO - Oh, hello! - Hi. - We've been waiting for you. - Here. - You must be tired. - Yes. Okay. Thank you for paying. The treatment is having an effect. Thank you. Thanks for coming. - I'll fill up on gas before I return... - Hey. What? How long will you keep this up? I don't think this is helping at all. Misaki is getting weaker. She's having trouble walking now. So... what's the point in doing this? It will take some time before we see results. - Really? - Yeah. But tell me, these electromagnetic mats and stuff... How much did you spend on them? - This isn't helping... - What do you want me to do? You know what? It's easy for you to talk. You're not family. Mind your own business from now on. Okay. These are just sheets of paper. Sheets of paper with scenery on them. Bresson once said that to photograph is to put the head, the eye, and the heart on the same line of sight. In other words, it's a way of life. To be a pro, you obviously need talent and technique. But the most important thing is the photographer's heart. What you wish for when you press the shutter button. What about you, Asakura? What wish do you want to capture in your photos? A wish? Hiking in the mountains is pretty tough. Thank you for coming with me. After what happened before, I thought you'd turn me down. You were really drunk then. I don't have the time to find a boyfriend. I have a dream. A dream? I only work in advertising to make a living. Someday, I want to climb mountains all over the world, and take photos for myself. That's my dream. In our line of work, a broken heart isn't a disadvantage. Tragic love makes for powerful art. That's what I think, at least. You should get some sleep. MISAKI ARIAKE DELETE CANCEL DO YOU WANT TO DELETE MISAKI ARIAKE? DELETED. Hey. I'm putting you down. What? Do I have the wrong date? Huh? Come on! - Excuse me. - Yes? Is the clinic closed today? Oh! That doctor got arrested yesterday. Huh? Wait, what? Turns out it was a scam. A scam... They were scamming their patients for money. Awful business. Well, damn... They got us good. Crap. Oh, well... Don't worry. I'll find another way to cure you. Okay? No, it's fine. Don't waste any more money on me. I couldn't get you any decent treatment. I couldn't do anything. I'm sorry for being such a useless brother. Come on, now. Don't you remember? Ever since mom and dad died... you've always looked after me. That's not true. When I took over the restaurant, I was rude to the customers... I ruined the food... I know, right? But even so... you always said it was okay, so I... I... I'm sorry. Forgive me. - I'm so sorry. - Takashi. I'm hungry. Why don't we go grab a bite to eat? Misaki? What's wrong, Misaki? You okay? Hey! How would you like it done? Do you want to dye it too? Shall I bleach it for you? Hello, Misaki! How are you? Same as always. I see. I brought the things you asked for. Collagen, placenta extract, carotenoids. And what's this? But you know... I don't think you have to take them. What do you mean? I didn't mean it like that. Sorry. You don't know what it's like. You're pretty, without a single wrinkle. Don't worry about me. You should make preparations for the wedding. Misaki. About the wedding... We're postponing it. Huh? Why? - What's that supposed to mean? - It's not... - I knew it! - I... - We don't... - It's my fault, isn't it? - You're saying it's my fault! - No, it's my work. It's not you... That's enough. I have to do my rehabilitation. Thanks for your help. - Misaki... - Please just leave! It's time for dinner. Aren't you going back? I'll keep it up a little longer. Ms. Ariake? Are you all right? - Nomura, could you come here? - What's the matter? Makabe, could you bring a towel? - Okay. - Don't worry, we'll wipe it up. Can I get a towel over here? It's not very nice, is it? Let's get you changed. It's all right now. I'll put a portable toilet here. Ring the buzzer if you need help. We'll be right back. Did you take Mr. Sasaki's temperature? Not yet, sorry. Here. Use this. I have three million. I can't accept that. I'm family too. I want to help. Misaki is like a sister to me too. What a perfect day to leave the hospital. Okay. There we go. Ayano. There's somewhere I want to go. Where? Thank you. I'm fine now. All right. It's ready! Let's eat. Pretty fancy, right? Go on, eat. Do you want some meat? I wonder if it's ready. - Hey, Ayano. - What? Please don't come here anymore. You know, ever since I got sick... I've been so jealous of you. You're so pretty. So bright. If you stay here with me, I'll envy you even more. I think I'll end up hating you. - So... - That's fine. You can hate me. I don't care. Hate me all you want. - Just, please... - I don't want to hate you. I think of you... as my real sister. Ayano. Thank you for everything. Take care of my brother. Even after I'm gone, I want you to be his family forever. Promise me one thing. Promise me... that one day... one day for sure... we'll meet again. WE'RE SORRY CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE Lately, her condition is getting worse. I'm sorry to say that Misaki... will probably not live to see spring. Her condition may take a drastic turn for the worse. You'll love this, Misaki! It's a present from Santa. What do you think? It's the color of cherry blossoms. Try it on. Here. It fits like a glove. Great! It looks good on you. I've got the best taste ever. - I'm the man. - It's from Ayano, isn't it? Huh? Come on, now! Here's a red sock too. Write down a wish and put it in there. Where's the pen? I'll find a pen. This will do. - Hello. - Hi. - Mind the step. - Got it. - Careful. - We're coming in. - Thank you. - Careful there. Right through here. Okay, now around a corner. Okay. Thank you very much. I WANT MY SUFFERING TO END. Asakura. I removed the top frame. Could you move the lights forward? Okay. Okay, let's turn on the lights. - Okay. - Right. - Turning them on. - Good. There. - Up top too. - Okay. Asakura. Yes? Someone's here to see you. Got a moment? I'm sorry I lied to you. My sister... isn't the Misaki you know anymore. She didn't want to die in disgrace. She fought so hard. She didn't want you to see her like that. But... Deep down... she still misses you. I WANT TO SEE HARUTO. I already took it. Let me take at least one photo of you. About your proposal... It's okay. Even if it takes two years, or three. Or five. I want you... to forget about me. Give me a break! That's bullshit! Please. Save Misaki. Please! What a relief! To tell the truth, my heart was pounding. I'd be a hairdresser and use my magic to let my customers feel cute. Thank you. No one's ever said I'm beautiful before. It made me happy. Misaki. Your brother told me everything. About your disease. I'm sorry I didn't notice anything. You must have been so scared. I'm sorry I didn't notice. I'm still... overwhelmed. I don't understand. I can't believe it. What's happened... to you. But... No matter... no matter what you look like... I love you. You are... the love of my life. I'll be back. I promise. Thank you. I know that was sudden. I'm sorry. I was so scared. But... I'm happy. I got to hear his voice again. He said he loves me. The heater in my apartment broke down. Now I'm constantly wrapped in a blanket, shaking with cold. If only Santa would give me a new heater. If only he'd say, "Sure, you can have one." But Christmas is over. We used fake snow at the studio the other day. It was so pretty, I got all choked up. I simply couldn't look away from it. Takanashi got so mad at me. He said he'd shove the whole can down my throat. That movie you fell asleep watching. It's out on DVD now. But it's still not available for rent. I'll rent it once some time has passed. Do you remember... when you cut my earlobe? At first, it hurt so much, and I was shocked. But now I'm glad it happened. Because of that accident, I could go on a date with you. Hey, Misaki? We've only known each other for a little while. But all of the time we've shared has been happy. So... next year... Next year... We'll visit lots of different places. Let's watch the cherry blossoms again. We'll have some drinks and party. In the summer, we'll watch the fireworks. In the fall, we'll go camping and see the pretty leaves. We'll cook food over an open fire. In the winter, we could go to a hot spring, or make a snowman together. And have a snowball fight with your brother. We'll do all of that. We'll do that... and make... lots of happy memories. What about you, Asakura? What wish do you want to capture in your photos? Next month, I'm going to take part in Takanashi's exhibition. We'll rent a gallery and display some of our work. This will be the first time I can display my works as a photographer. I want you... to see my photos. Today is the last day. Are you sure? Are you really... not going? TIME AND SPACE I can't see him. Don't give up. Don't just give up like that! You have given up on lots of things since you got sick. Your work, your dream of owning a salon... Getting married and raising a happy family. You've been so strong. That's why you can't give up on the most important thing. Please let me know if I can help with anything. All right, enjoy the exhibition! Welcome. Haruto... Haruto Asakura... His photos are in that room over there. Shall I show you there? No, I'm all right. Please watch your step. Step a little closer, please. Act like you're good friends. You can move if you want to. I'm Misaki Ariake, and I'll be your hairdresser today. Thank you. How would you like it done? I'm glad I fell in love with you. One day, I'll make the lie come true. So when I finally take a great photo, I'd like you to see it. Why won't you fight for it? You can't just abandon your dream because it's hard. Pick up the camera again! Misaki! I want to change! I don't want to run anymore. I thought it might be your color. My color? Your smile is just like... cherry blossoms in full bloom. You're beautiful. If you kiss her, I'll kill you. - I'm sorry! - The bell just rang, champ. Misaki. Will you marry me? I want to... share a life with you. I want to be with you forever. "Things that never change." You didn't see her? I'll go back there. Yeah. Looks like an accident up ahead. - I'll get out here. - Okay. Thank you. Haruto... Haruto... Haruto... I miss you. Haru... Are you okay, ma'am? Here. Thank you. Don't mention it. Please take care. I'm sorry... I couldn't invite you to the cremation. She was so stubborn until the end. I wonder who she got it from. She had this... hidden away. I couldn't put it in the casket with her. You've got it wrong. She would have wanted Haruto to have it. You see... in a way, it's a part of her. Do you mind if I... go into her room? I didn't notice. In the snow that day... you smiled with your whole face as you thanked me. This bus is bound for Haneda Airport International Terminal via Haneda Airport Domestic Terminal. For your safety, we ask that passengers fasten... - Use your legs! Keep moving! - Okay! - Punches in bunches! - Got it! Her appearance may have changed, but her heart was the same. I... am proud of her, as a sister. Thank you. To Haruto. I've never written you a letter before. I feel a little nervous. I went to your exhibition. Thanks for inviting me. I was really afraid to go outside. But you helped me out of my shell. Going outside after so long was like an exciting adventure. It was just what I needed. Because your photos were so beautiful. You know something? I was always scared of the passage of time. I was scared of how... my appearance and my situation changed. But some things never change. THINGS THAT NEVER CHANGE In your photos... I remain 25 years old, just like you. The scenery we saw... Our memories of that day... will never change, no matter how much time passes. When I think like that, I feel really happy. Haruto. I'm glad I cut your earlobe that day. I'm glad you asked me out at the hospital. I'm glad you took up photography again. It was only for a short time... but I'm so glad... I got to share my life with you. You made me glad... about so many things. Do you remember? One time, while I was cutting your hair, you said it too. "I'm glad I fell in love with you." So am I. I'm... glad I fell in love with you. And I always will be. Now and forever... I will always love you, Haruto. Too bad we couldn't see each other today. I wasn't feeling very well, so I went home as soon as I saw your photos. So I look forward to seeing you again someday. When we meet again, I want to see more of your photos. Your photos are lovely. Don't stop taking them. Haruto. Thank you. Misaki Ariake She's on the other side of the world. PUESTA DE SOL DE MAKOTO Don't let Makoto beat you. That's good. Try to look happier. Smile! Good! Big smiles all around! Look surprised. Just like that. Great! Now, from your elbows and up. Last one. - Great work. - Thank you! - Thank you. - Thanks. - Get in there. - Okay. You can only find the answer through the viewfinder. Huh? No matter how much we struggle and writhe, we photographers can only find the answer through the viewfinder. Yes... Like your photos at the exhibition. That was the first time I saw photos taken solely for someone else's sake. I'll keep taking photos. I'll probably always regret the one moment I failed to notice you. I'll keep struggling to find an answer. That's why, when spring comes, I always remember you. My love like the falling petals. Please take a flier! - Oh, sorry! - Sorry. Would you like to be a haircut model? Subtitle translation by: Douglas Jern
