My God, it's ringing! One of them was some Bott, with two T's. He carried only to sheets of paper, like Holy Communion. I though, if that last... Are your people stay at the bottom. - Yes, in their suits, but they die. Damn it! - I heard the killed their parents. Look at the size of the uniforms. - They killed Gvozden and Isidor's parents? The whole family, entire village, everyone. - A Serbian village? It isn't German, don't be boring. They're fine comrades, like steel! They execute? - Shut up! When did they start? - Shut up! My God, I'm hungry like crazy! Look at the running water, freedom! Freedom! That's it! When you get old one day, if anything happens to you, you'll be able to say lived in the sweat of your black dream! You two, and two more, and three more! Hey, comrades! Enough scrubbing! Comrades, you'll skin yourselves! - Leave it on the window. Why are you standing here? - Here's clothes for you! A shirt! Comrade! You're angry, Gvozden, are you? - Of course I'm angry! Go away already! Come here, Gvozden! We talked good things about Hitler so he doesn't kill you! She'll open the window! I'm telling you, she'll open it! Go and take the clothes. Go and take the clothes, I'll kill you! Let her watch! The war is over, who cares! Go away, do you hear? He's angry. That's what Gvozden is like. The war is over. Be happy, comrades! Give it to me. - Go away already! Close the window, Isidor, the hell with you both! - Alright. Look at the she-devil! - When everything gets to its place, the old rules will be back! I'm not that type. I wonder how would you wash yourself in a stream, damn you! Bela, take this. Listen, like we agreed. Don't get confused, just be brave. Damn, what's this now? What should we do? Where the hell are you going? Quiet children, order! I said order! Order! Let me see how tough you are now, Gvozden, not afraid of the devil or anything! Excuse me, please, comrades. Please, could kids spend this holiday among fighters? Go on. - Our brave comrades... - Brave. - Brave. Our commissioner ordered that they spend this holiday with fighters. I'm the editor of our newspaper. Today when all over the front... - Ask him! Hey, just... - Damn you! If you'll allow me, please... Was Zarko Katanic with you in the company? His mother, my colleague, also a teacher, lives here. She can't walk. And he's a nice, quiet boy, blond. This is my brother, Isidor. Here, here, take it! Take this. - No, thank you. - Here, you take it. And you ran away! My own brother... And you got flowers... Good luck to you. Well thank you. When I remember the size of that bomb... How did you get out then? How did you survive? You ran away, you devil! If only I'd know, what are you hiding in that chest? What? - You can't come in, they're getting ready. - Move! Hey, where are the chests? I don't know. Move! Will you change your shirt? - My shirt? Of course. Something poor. I know you're hiding something in that chest, but never mind! How about you? What is it? I wish I know who killed Manojlo. I heard from my dad that German airplanes threw down bombs, and they didn't let anyone know they'll do that, so they they didn't announce the war, I don't know how. Because of that, many people died, children too, Belgrade citizens, on 6th of April on 1941., in the morning, because they wanted 'better a war than the pact'. I don't know how to write, I only know to draw. I'll be an artist when I grow older. Here's my drawing on a big paper. Dragan Lubarda, student of the third grade. Our heroes were real partisans. They were charging at fascists bunkers, and at barbed wires, and at fascists. They were heroes. And they weren't fascists, they were just seduced. Death to fascism, freedom to the people! Djordje Milojevic, a student. Dwarfs were going to see the Belgrade liberation. They were going to the graves of people's heroes, and later they went to a big carousel where they were spinning, spinning and spinning. They spinning in circles, spinning, and that's how they spent their lives. Lela, stop! Stop! Stop, give me back my drawing! Lela! Good afternoon. I'm looking at your drawings, and I say they're alright! - Let's go, uncle! Comrades pioneers, youth and soldiers, your meeting today, the fact that pioneers... that they were able to hear you exploits is very commendable. How expensive is freedom price, and comrades fighters saw your drawings and heard you. But it doesn't matter what will you write or say in this school. Be quiet! - Let's go, uncle! Let's go. Let's go, uncle! We can't, kid, do you hear me? - ... that fascism was beaten! But fight for a man is before us! You think I don't know what are you hiding in you chest. Let's go, uncle! Let's go! - I'm leaving. Let's go, uncle! Let's go! Dwarfs were going to see the Belgrade liberation. They were going to the graves of people's heroes, and later they went to a big carousel where they were spinning, spinning and spinning. They spinning in circles, spinning, and that's how they spent their lives. Can that be done faster? - It can, but at photographer. It's her! Again. Comrades! Comrades, stop. I'm inviting you for one drink! That means one drink! On the Victory day! That was yesterday! - Of course, but it's today too! Do you see this tavern? Germans were sitting here just a year ago! Those with ribbons here! The scariest ones! One of them came for a drink, and said 'I'll pay for it!'. Me to drink with the Germans? I'd rather be dead! And he was blond... and tall. I realised what was going on... He grabbed me for my boob! What can I say? He had a heavy hand and liked to hit with it more than anything. And when he sang... he had a voice like a bull! If only I could know what's with him now. He said he wasn't married! Like it's unknown where are women's nerves and what are they for. I don't believe them nothing! They come to sleep and they leave, Kraut business... You sure showed them! They didn't stop until they've reached Vienna. Lazarevic? - It's me! Come with me. - Now! - What? How did he say? - On Serbian. It's no use, it's ruined, we have to make a new one. - Move! Hey, comrade. Come on, Isidor. - A man can't sleep here. - You're used to it. You Kraut whore! Whore! Whore! Fascist and enemy whore! You whore! Birthday, on a birthday! And who's celebrating my birthday? Tell me! Were they feeding you with candy? - Comrades, I called you. My comrades will show you! Here they are! Comrades! - Get away! I will go with you, I want to see her die! I want to shoot her in the chest! Oh God, I'll show her... - Calm down! Whore! Calm down. - Forgive me. But you know who shot, and we ran at the bunkers trough the wire! What did they ask her to send for a birthday? And your sins... you live with that. Are you thirsty? So am I, you see, my mouth are dry. Isidor! Water! And you don't say anything anymore. Why didn't you say when they asked you? They'll know, there are rules. The court is here, they'll decide. There are rules. Where's Isidor? If I sent him to get death, we would live for a long time. Will you shoot me? I wish I know who killed Manojlo. Their officer, there are all kind of stories... That's not the point. Wait! They're hiding their stuff, do you understand? She came out of here, out of me! - Please, don't. I was worrying for her for 20 years, and nothing more. My Milica. They want to kill my child! My little Mica, what should I do? Please don't, please. They're hiding that, understand? Wait until fuss is over. - No one knows my misery! Here they are! Three corners is a penalty. - Lepsa, please don't! Isidor, forward! Comrades, wait, please. It's me again, I'm a bit annoying. But I have to ask for my children, comrades. Do you know who am I talking about? That little girl, with big eyes. A little Gypsy. If I hadn't dressed her nicely, everyone would thought she was a Gypsy. Germans too, every once in a while were asking for documents. And a child... She ran away, so they don't catch her and take her to a camp! You know how were those times. You could lose your head in a second! Where is your commandant? I'm begging you! I want to explain what happened to her! The child was scared! Who will help me? They'll kill my child! Some people, bandits have taken her in the woods. Some bandits! Oh my God! Poor Milica! You didn't catch Captain Nikitovic, didn't you? And you want to kill my child! Listen! Listen, please comrade! - Move! - What's your name? Gvozden, move! - Listen, Gvozden. I heard you're sending prisoners to Russia. It's alright, of course! Russia is a Soviet country! Nothing wrong there! Here, me and Milica, we'll go to Russia together! Why not? We'll work there! We're not afraid of Russia, our Soviet country. Listen comrade, this is how your men sing! I'll shoot you! - Isidor, are you insane? Shoot me, you scum! Can't you see I want that? Where will you shoot me? In the heart? In the chest? Where did you shoot my child? My Milica? To my only child! They really shot her. Shot her... They didn't! I won't allow it! You have to adjust. That goes for you too as well. You'll remain fighters even in civil clothes. How? - Demobilization, Isidor. It's that. - But why? What do you mean why? It's over! We're not needed anymore. Gvozden... - I understand comrade commissioner. Gvozden, but why? - Shut up! Shut up! Listen, fights haven't stopped and they won't stop for a ling time. We have new fights, in homes in families. Fights for new relationships between people. That's the front too! - I don't know how to live! - But you know to talk! It's over. - That's reality. Rational and dialectically necessary. We have bloody fight forthcoming, against remains of old habits. Petty-bourgeois sentiment and other. You have to participate in that fight with your youth, with your... But if only I'd know who killed Manojlo. Attention, attention. Passenger train from Skoplje to Zagreb across Vinkovci and Slavonski Brod trough Doboj, Sarajevo, Gospic and Split is in delay of 120 minutes. I repeat... Pal! Hey you! - Hey, comrade! Where is it? Tell us, man. - It wasn't me, comrades. I don't know anything. - Where is it? - Who's in delay. Is it train? - No, an airplane! - Damn fools! If only I'd know who killed Manojlo He's dead too. - I know, but what way? Well now... What's the matter? My stomach hurts. - Well go then. - Will you guard it? Tell me, what are you hiding in the chest? - Shut up! He said it's underwear. Pay... attention... to cleanliness... She's so hairy... Like she's not a woman, but a bear. I'll never get married. Nor Isidor. There's no cattle in Kozina, let alone girls. Gvozden! Did you see what happen to us? Did you see, comrade and brother? - Let me go! Three corners is a penalty. Where the hell did he go? Where? Isidor? He left. - Where did he left? - He left. Where did he go? - I told him: 'comrade we're traveling together to Brod, and then everyone to his on way'. - Where did he go? And he took the chests and left! - Wait here! Comrades, I'm a cousin. She's my cousin, Lepa from Bosnia. We just want to know about Mica, her daughter. Milica Samardzic, little Mica... What a pest! - Is she alive, comrade? - Back off! - Wait, comrade... Did she hear? She didn't, for sure. The train will leave, damn it. Poor girl fought brave at Grandma's beam. She was great! Everyone will help. - I hope they will. Did we overcome? Tell me. - We did. It's one of them. - You be quiet! When it's from God, and when it's from people! Communists. Communists, huh? Communists, of course! - Sit down, let me talk! Where are you machine guns? - Where's your beard? You cut it off,huh? Hey Red ones! - Bearded one, lice didn't eat you yet? How's your Stalin doing? - Show yourself you lousy dog! I'll rip your heart out! - They taught you to rip heart out, huh? Say another word, come on! - Do you want to go in the coffin? Isidor! People! - That's how you communists do things! He's my brother, damn you! - And my brother is to roth in the grave? Three corners is a penalty. Stand back! We, two brothers, we're both fighting war! Don't cry mother, if we got killed! One of the brothers got hit by a grenade! If feel sorry for my people, not for me! Our hill, do you hear it? Watch! Oh troubles, my troubles! We, two brothers, we're both fighting war! Don't cry mother, if we got killed! Is that him? - Who else could be? He was always going to get wood. You came back alive, huh? - Alive. You stayed alive, and people in your village... You heard. - We did. - Isidor, you can't sing without thinking. You can't forget. It's no use. He has no parents, nor his house. It's over. There was blood and misery, that's for sure. But nowhere like in Kozina. Was that in 1943.? At spring. Around this time. And there's no our people? Gone? They're gone! Can't you hear? Well then, you'd say there's no other Serbs but those who are coming from the army. They weren't all in the same army. And so, some are coming back, some don't. They're not all communists? - How's that? How could you know who'll win? - How did we know? - You knew? Everyone from Kozina? - People and cattle, all! How? - Who's there to tell you? No one survived but one Kraut. Kraut? - What did you say? - Kraut. A real Kraut. When they started killing and burning Kozina down... He said he doesn't want to. Then he shoot his men with machine gun. - And? He survived somehow. But poor man lost his mind. - And? - Nothing. Partisans came trough here later. No one bothered him. Why should they? A God's man. - He's alive, but he'd be better off dead. People see him up in the mountains, eating sorrel. - So... - Yes. Listen Isidor, If only I have one regiment of fascists here... So I can... - So they can shoot from the top, and us to go behind them. Listen, don't lay a finger on that Kraut over there. Did you hear me? - Why would I bother him? But... Gvozden? - What is it? If only I'd know who killed Manojlo. Enough about the war now. We're going to the ruins now, we must be strong! Kraut! - Don't make fun of him! Kraut! Kraut! It's us! Comrades! Partisans! Communists, do you hear? It looks like rocks grow too. It seems there were less of it before. Weed grows. Would you recognize it? - I would. Our house is always the same. You can't kill house. If only I could find something theirs? - Mothers? Or fathers, never mind. - What would you do? - I don't know. Just to have it... - Is there God, Gvozden? There's no God, Isidor. - How do you know? I know. - You know because Manojlo told you. - Don't. - How did he know? Gvozden... - Leave me alone, I want to sleep. We have to work tomorrow. What can we do? Come on, tell me. Uncle Pista, is that the one? - Yes. - And now, Zivkovic... - Move. Shoot me. Come on. Shoot! Gvozden? - What is it? Go to sleep. I so want to shoot right now. - Don't be crazy. It's over. - What would I shoot with? Right? Shut up, Isidor. - You'd shoot too. Admit it. - Will you let me sleep? Who would say it's that much pleasure? He doesn't understand. - A real Kraut. It's your first time, Isidor. You'll get used to it. Are you sleeping? - Neither are you. You can imagine. You hear them coming. You know how they do it. Can you imagine, huh? They think there's no one, it's a desert. And you wait for them ten feet away. And then just shoot. Take that you damn devils! If only I could shoot now. - Well shoot. And you? - Where would I get a weapon? From the chest. You said you keep shirts in there! Do you have ammunition? - Plenty! How about you? We, two brothers, we're both fighting war! Don't cry mother, if we got killed! We, two brothers, we're both fighting war! Don't cry mother, if we got killed! One of the brothers got hit by a grenade! Isidor? - Yes! - Ready? - Yes! - Forward! Come on, in God's name! I love our house too. If it would be my way, we wouldn't leave Kozina. We still have to fight in the family, in the factory... For build, that's it. - You're just repeating commissioner?s word and that comrade Cirilo's. Damn Kraut! - Don't touch him, do you hear! Do you hear? Don't touch him! Did you hear me? Is that him? Vlatko, it's him. And you're alive, Vlatko? I am. I thank to the Virgin Mary. I bought a bicycle too. - So you have a bicycle now? - Yes. So you have a bicycle and you're alive. Alive, and you have a bicycle. And you have Virgin mary. You have your mother and father. And you have sister, and everything. Well then... Kiss me on the mouth. On the mouth, please! Get away! I'll be right back. What is it? - Nothing. I was going... To the toilet. - Then wait! Three corners is a penalty! Three corners is a penalty! Three corners is a penalty! What did you say? What did you say? Three corners is a penalty! What's wrong? - Why are you hitting him? People, he'll kill the child, damn bastard! You don't want to say it. You won't. - I will. - Then say it. - What? I'm asking you fifth time, why were you beating that brat? - Just because. Did he talk bad about someone? One of our people? His sister was here... I'm asking you because of her, you understand? I understand. - What did he say? Do you hear me? What did he do? Nothing. - Nothing? So you were beating him for nothing? Listen, comrade, I know well who are you and what are you. That you're a fighter. And to be honest, I don't care if you were beating some chetnik kid or not. Why are you silent in front of me, like I'm a German, damn it! What do you think, where have I lost this arm? At my lover's place? Where have you lost it? On Zelengorje. You were there? I was. How did you get out? I was lucky, that's it. I wasn't wounded at all for four years. I was lucky, that was it. - Damn it, bullet won't get into you. Let the whore wait outside! Gvozden... Was it Gvozden? - Gvozden. Alright about that brat, Gvozden, but don't do it again, just don't. There are people who take care of that. You know some guy... Vlatko? - I know him. You were beating him too? - Yes! - And broke his bicycle? - Yes! And swore on his mother? - I didn't do that! Get out now. Get out! Isidor, let's go home! To Kozina! It can be, huh? - It can! I told you! I hope so! Gvozden, let's put down the chests so we can take the weapons out! Put them down! - That's it! That's it! Let's put this chests down so we can take the weapons out! Gvozden! Gvozden! Gvozden, can you hear me? You two are standing like you've never seen a bear! Where are you from? - From Kozina. Who killed it? - Comrade. Who? - Comrade Cirilo. Goodbye, goodbye! What a good riffle means. That low life killed a bear this big, like it's nothing! What did you carry in the chest? - A blanket. I took it from the barracks, so what? I can take it, I don't even have a house... - You can! What's that? - A mirror. New one, I bought it. Look at this. We won't get married. And you keep carrying whores in mirrors. Our house and family is gone, and that's it! Isidor, we won the fights for other people's lives, and what about ours? How dare you speak to me like that! - Crazy woman! Mujo calks a horse in the moonlight... Mujo calks and mothers swears him. You don't calk horses in the moonlight, but in the daylight and in white sun. But in the daylight and in white sun. I said it, and he didn't do anything. He just turned around and left. Isidor. Isidor! Are you asleep? - I'm sick. Let me ask you something. - What? Leave me alone. - Then in the toilet... behind the bar. With that fat guy, with mustache. Did you? And you wanted to bring a virgin to this forsaken place. Some fighter you are! Hold on, brother, I'm coming! Kraut. Kraut? Stop it, Kraut. Damn you! I could've killed you like a fly, admit it! - I though it was Kraut! I could've! - You could've! Kraut, don't throw pebbles, I'll kill you! Kraut! - What is it? He's so crazy. Isidor, where the hell are you? Show yourself! Kraut! Kraut! Do you hear me? Run, please. Run! Run, Kraut! Isidor?
