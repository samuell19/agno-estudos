[music dramatically increasing] [soft mysterious music] [disco music] [music continues] [motorcycles buzzing] [Fred] Sometimes you'll be surprised how close it is to you. I found out, but that was only later. Every day for 22 years I drove past this dry wash in the way to my shop. In all those years, I didn't once take the time to look or even listen to the sounds that roared at me from behind that standard scrub. It was here a lot of the kids in the neighborhood got to racing around in their go-karts, making a lot of dust and noise. But when I retired, I started looking a lot at it and learning about this world they call off-road. [screams] Here's how you get there. On three wheels, four, six wheels or two. [motorcycle revving] You can make that world for yourself on any steep hill. Especially the kind of ditch to spit out the dust and keep coming back at her. Wide open is the only way to the top. Sometimes, the spectator takes his chances along with the driver. Well, you're right: dirt is dirt no matter where you find it. What made it different for me, though, was the kind of people that moved around in it. I'm gonna... I want to get to know better, you know? How they think and how they feel and... Well, you know, the highs and that kind of thing. I got a lot of time on my hands and... Well, I thought this would be a good way to spend it. Well, here we go. [grunts] [soft piano music] One of the first things I learned was that the off-road world is a family affair. You take bikes, for instance, You'll find machines that match up with the size and weight for every member of the family. And when the kids start going head-to-head, they bring along the fiercest rooters in the world. [motorcycles revving] Now, there everybody's a future Joelle O'Leary, Malcolm Smith or Roger Decoster. Like the man says: sometimes you eat the bear, sometimes the bear eats you. [funk music] [disco music] A few more pounds, a few more years, they're ready for motocross. Men and machine and dirt. Kidney-shaking bumps. Grimes and a guy who'll stop at nothing to win. Or at least beat you out. Where did it all begin? Well, in this country we haven't exactly been strangers to the automobile. [ragtime music] Even back when they called them horseless carriages, all it took was one vehicle, one man behind the wheel who wouldn't settle for the ordinary, and a love affair between dirt and driver began. The movie people are always ready to get in on a good thing. And they gave us this thrilling tale. In this early Hollywood saga, we see the story of a young man out for a quiet spin in the country. Suddenly, he decided he'd had enough of the ordinary. Off he goes. Off, looking for adventure. And danger. [ragtime music continues] [chicken clucking] [horses neighing] [gunshots] Looks like he found the danger. When I was a boy, we had our heroes. Big names like Barney Oldfield, or Eddie Rickenbacker. They went to work on the cars: strip the body, tore off the fenders, beefed up the engines. Challenged not only each other, but the limits of their rigs. Would you believe you can get up to 14 horsepower in one of these bombs? These early road racers challenged a strongly held scientific concept. The experts told us we'd never be able to drive faster than 50 miles an hour. A human wouldn't be able to breathe going that fast. Nowadays, progress has come so far, we all breath air like this. And the cars got faster, the crowds bigger , Speeding over 100 miles an hour. They can only push so far. Drivers learn to live or die with danger. And with dirt. Out of that, came the sprint car. 1600 pounds of handcrafted racer. O pen cockpit. The call for constant over steering . Power sliding turns. [instrumental music] Squanomie falls, Pittsbourough, Ascot. Just names for you? Well, 40 or 50 years ago, they were the tracks where men like Rick Furcall, Jan Opperman, Smokey Snowpack put it all on the line 85 times a year. To they, the world of dirt is pushed way past the oval track of a sprint car. You find all kinds of machines. [funky techno music] Like these dragsters. Digging into the dirt, these dragsters explode from a standing starting speed of 120 mph in three seconds or less. [funk music] Well, sir, I got my first taste of the world of dirt here in the national sand drags in Bakersfield, California. It's a mighty nice place to be. [country music] And it was here I met Tommy Robertson, top national drag racing competitor. Bakersfield's got it all. I'll tell you, Fred. Here in Bakersfield we got the best cars running. We got modified Jeep classic, we got dune buggies, we got hot dragsters. We got... Fred? -Fred? -Yeah? Did you come here to see the cars or... something else? Well, I guess I came to see everything. Well, you came to the right place. Listen, Fred, here at Bakersfield, we got just about everything. [Tommy] Modified class, Jeeps, Chevy Blazers... [engine srevving] [Tommy] But for my money, the superstars of the fuel-burning dragsters and those babies are pushed by as much as a thousand horsepower. [disco music] And that's a flameout, Fred. Somebody just kissed $15,000 goodbye. [Fred] Tommy sent me on to Pismo Beach, California, and another kind of sand drag competition. And I met another inhabitant of this world of dirt: Randy Gardner. You're not kidding. I come every day, Pismo Beach is where it's at. You're going to see it all here. I mean, we got classes for more kind of buggies than you can ever believe. [jazz music] And not just drag races, but the meanest, baddest dune climbs you ever saw. [rock music] [Fred] A dune climb is like a hill climb in one respect: you have to make it to the top. [Randy] [laughs] If you say so. Hey, go get them! Here at Pismo, they got so many different kinds of machines entering, -they keep inventing new classes. -[Fred laughs] [upbeat piano music] [Randy] Sometimes, you just can't keep up with everybody. [jazz music] That's a buddy of mine on a '46 Ford hood. He kind of forgot something called the law of friction. [laughs] That's called flying by the seat of your pants. [Fred] From Labor Day to the 4th of July is 10 months. And from the ocean due to Pismo beach to the base of Pikes Peak is 1,300 miles and 5,400 feet of elevation. [soft instrumental music] Some will tell you that this is the granddaddy of off-road racing. Since 1916, a Pikes Peak hill climb has taken its toll of cars. And of motorcycles. [motorcycles buzzing] [engine revving] This 14-mile course is still as dangerous and as much of a challenge to racing driver Rick Meyers. He and his brother Roger have been daring the tight turns and sheer drops of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb since 1972. It's also a family tradition for young Bobby Unser Jr. The Unser have been putting this one away for the last eight years. [indistinct chatter] [laughs] Louis Unser builds engines. His machines have been some of the fastest on the market. Bobby Unser is here today in the unfamiliar role of spectator. Along with Parnelli Jones. Rick Meyers and Peter Firestone check out Rick's tires. They've taken sprint tires and re grooved them so, the tread can cut through the loose gravel to grab onto solid ground and find traction. Well, it's all about cutting it. It's just a step. -That's right. -By cutting it, it'll soften it but give it a little more pressure in the center part of the tire. That's right. Make the hold thing hold a little more. -I guess I'll find out. -I agree. We'll both find out. It's not gonna hurt you. [engine revving] [Fred] There goes Bobby Unser Jr. [commentator] It looks like he's making a pretty good time... [Fred] The family follows his progress. [commentator] We can see him in there, he's really moving. The crowd is appreciating a good race. He's on a curve. His tail is moving a little sideways going out of those curves. Apparently, the road is a little loosy, skating just a little bit. [Fred] Bobby Jr.'s time? 12 minutes, 52 seconds. [engine purring] Something for Rick Mears to beat. That and 14 miles of switchback road, 156 turns, and a climb of 9,392 ft. [engine revving] [disco music] The sun's your enemy. first it's behind you, then it owns your windshield on a snaky left-hander. Now, for a high right-hander, coming at 100 mph, stand on the break, throw your car sideways. [music continues] Then flat-out through the esses. Now for a blue-sky turn, nothing for markers but blue sky. At this speed, Rick turns his wheel right to go left and left to go right. The racers call this opposite lock. And the dirt takes all opposite lock. [music continues] It's 6,000 ft. down. A lot less, if you're lucky. [engine revving] After eight years of Unser domination, today is a new winner. Rick Mears puts Bobby Unser on second place by over 40 seconds. [soft instrumental music] I got down to earth in a hurry at the Indian Dunes cycle park, some 40 miles or so north of Los Angeles, where I took in the national women's motocross championships. I met a great young gal. Dee Williams, 17. But when it comes to motocross racing, no longer a novice. -Hi, Fred. -Dee has been racing competitively for... three years? Well, a little more than two and a half. Almost three. You know, that's really great. A lot of women get into motorcycles because of their family. That's my friend Nani Evans over there, with her dad, Walker. He's part of Parnelli Jones' racing team. [man speaking indistinctly in microphone] [Fred] Tell me, Dee, is racing something you can do on a full-time basis? [Dee] We're getting there. The prize money is coming along. This race has prices of over $1000. [Fred] Well, that's respectable. [Dee] It sure can help. But when you look at the equipment a racer has to wear, to say nothing of the cost of, you know, of keeping up a bike, you take all the help you can get, including tips on strategy. Just before you turn the sideway, go ahead and get in there. - All right. -All right? Good luck, sweety. [Fred] Every year, you see more and more young women turning up for races here at Indian Dunes and other tracks along the country. [Dee] I like the motocross. It's a short race, so, a lot of whoop-de-doos and tight turns. In fact, I think motocross can make you a better driver. [Fred] If you're last out the course. [Dee laughs] Yeah, that's part of it, too. [motorcycles revving] [motorcycles revving] [motorcycles buzzing] [disco music] [Fred] Women's motocross, I see, is beginning to make its own name: Sue Fish, Jan Thornton, Jean Cazar, and a lot of others, trying to prove their own thing. [Dee] Let me tell you, when you weigh 95 pounds a 175-pound bike can be one big mother. [engine revving] [music continues] [ukulele music] [Fred] It's a hell of a big difference between the beauties of the women's motocross to the beast's juicy plow on their way to the swamp buggy races here in Naples, Florida. [music continues] Did you come all the way down here to see these races? Well, we've been down here for a couple months, we just happen to know them. We heard of them and we decided we'd come and see them. -All the way back in Indiana you heard them? -Oh, yes. I see. I'll tell you what, you really enjoy it. This is your fist race, is... something that's really a sight to behold. It's like Daytona and Indianapolis all in one. ["Swamp buggy" by Johnny Talon playing] Driving my swap buggy You know it is A strange machine Drive the alligators crazy 'Cause It's the strangest creature That they've seen Swamp buggy Swamp buggy boogie Swamp buggy Swamp buggy Showing the extreme [music ends] Down here, in the Florida, Bayou Country, they've been running a competition over the Maples mile of mud for over 30 years. And a fella that's figured in most of those races is Swamp Rat Pickering. Swamp Rat, I got to say that those are funny-looking critters. Yeah, we build them to get the job done, Fred. High and tall, and thin wheels so you work your way through these back waters and shoals of the Florida Everglades. [Fred] Yeah. [engine revving] We're gonna see seven different classes of races today. Well, I got to say that's a mighty mean looking course. Yeah, we got in front of zero, figure eight trench, very exact. The main feature is Sippy's hole. -[Fred] Sippy's hole? -[Swamp Rat] Yeah, named after Sippy Morris. He never seemed to miss all them bumps he put on that pile of water. [Fred laughs] [Swamp Rat] They got extra heavy rear axles and wheels. Even water filled tractor tires. They give me the extra traction you need to work your way out of Sippy's hole. I knew we're gonna get along, Fred. [both laugh] [Fred] The ideal swamp buggy has a center of gravity high enough so you won't sink to the bottom, but low enough so the sucker don't turn over. Sometimes, you just can't figure. ["Swamp buggy" playing] [commentator speaking indistinctly on speakers] [commentator speaking indistinctly on speakers] Say, cousin. Thank you, Fred. Look at them go, Fred. Swamp buggy Swamp buggy boogie Swamp buggy It's like a spaceship With wheels Turn and take a look behind me No, that I don't believe I said Swamp buggies By the dozen The swamp got them Just like me [commentator speaking indistinctly on speakers] [public cheering] [Swamp Rat] With all that water out there, you got to coat your power plant with a whole lot of plastic cement to seal electric systems. Then, you spray away with a garden hose and if you don't miss none, you're ready. This is a good, clean sport. It really builds character. And safe. Hell, I can't even remember the last time we lost a contestant to a water moccasin. Much less an alligator. So, you folks don't pay no attention to me. Y'all come. You hear? [Fred] The swamp buggy people hid the pitfalls of air race underwater. There's no such modesty here at riverside raceway on the edge of the California desert. This motocross circuit is designed to turn $10,000 or $12,000 worth of racing car into instant junk. [disco music] Today, there are 40,000 spectators at this event, which tried to jam the perils and rigors of a 100-mile desert race into 1.7 miles. [engines revving] [music continues] The winner today was Rick Mears but this is one race where survival pays off. Anything goes for jeeps, dune buggies. It's self-destruction carried into a high art. If you can finish, you made it to a very select group. [soft instrumental music] Park City, Utah, home of Utah's Skyline Snow Rally, a fierce competition putting man and machine against the side of this hill. [rock music] Here's where it happens. 310 feet high on a 58-degree incline. A large number of people turned out today. Drawn primarily by their interests in the scientific and engineering ramifications of this event. The hill started as a ski jump, when too many ski jumpers dropped dead, the Park City people had to find another use for it. [jazz music] In ski country, no hill ever goes to waste. And today, certainly not this one. [music continues] In the years of the Skyline Rally, no one has ever made it to the top. But a lot of them sure try. [man speaking on radio] [man] All right. -[man] Up the hill. -Let's have some heat. [man] Surprising. All the way. [engine revving] [commentator speaking indistinctly] [man 1] You got it, Billy! [man 2] Good shot. You know what? You can't tell where you're at. Almost there, you had it, man, but all you can see is snow every time it hits. I would just like to get that hill, I would love to go over. ["Snow Climb" by Alan Oldfield playing] Help me make it to the top Help me make it to the top Going up, me and you Spread it out You better give me room 'Cause I'm fuming, zooming Going crazy out of control Well, I've ridden all this way For all my friends To be able to say I saw him reach the top But I had to walk Help me make it to the top Help me make it to the top [engine revving] [men shouting] [man] You still have to go! [Fred] The race comes down to a contest between two brothers: Mike Brown and Randy Brown. As far as we're concerned , we won the class because it was light for, to begin with. [Fred] There seems to be some sort of disagreement. Yeah, he's run the same engine. The machine weighs under 1000 pounds, I'm way 1140. It just doesn't qualify for the class. My brother drove the same rail, in the same class last year. Now he's protesting me for driving it because I beat him. We got a little family feud between brothers. Now he's got to run against me, now I can't handle losing. You gotta be a good loser as long as you've been winner, it's tough. I know what it weighs. Where's your weight slip, bigmouth? I'm about to have fun and not even worry. If they want to protest, let them protest. [Fred] To settle this family feud, the brothers each get one more run at the hill. Mike goes first. [engine revving] Now it's Randy's turn. [engine revving] The family will be fighting this one up for another year. Until the next Skyline Snow Rally. [soft instrumental music] Ever since I first moved into the world of dirt and off-road racing, I began to hear a few names. Races like the Parker, the Mint 400 and always, the Baja 1000. And when you hear about the Baja, you also hear the name Parnelli Jones. I think it was time I looked into the family's race shop where Parnelli Jones builds his famous Formula 1 race cars, stock racers, Indy cars and off-road racers. But when I was there, Parnelli and his chief mechanic, Dick Russell, were looking to the Mint 400. And, beyond that, the Baja. [Dick] We build a lot of cars. And we've built Indianapolis cars and we've course built our off-road cars and stuff like that. And as far as I'm concerned, building cars is like having a baby. [Fred] Working on this special Chevy Blazer, they struggle to increase independent axle travel from eight inches to eighteen. That'll let the Blazer maintain higher speeds over rougher courses without bottoming out. [Dick] The car is very much a personality, so to speak. It is enjoyable, building and putting your own ideas into these cars. [Fred] Every nut, every bolt in the Blazer has been refined to make it stronger, lighter, fasters, to meet the challenge of the Nevada desert. And after that, the Baja. [disco music] But first, Las Vegas and the Mint 400. Three months straight, today has been turned into an off-road version of Indy's Gasoline Alley, with cars from all over the country moving in for technical inspection. Equipment and accessory manufacturers set up on Fremont Street to display their product. The new racing car owner can get himself quite a collection of decals. -Hey, give me a UNI sticker to put it right there. -Oh, sure, man. Look at that decal. I'll tell you what, you know, you're just slick. Well, good luck to you in the race. -Hey, Dennis, how are you? -Hey! Oh, I see you switched to Pennzoil. Well, no, that was my co-driver. At the last race he... Look, if you've got those big decals? We can cover that up. But have you got a couple of cases? -A couple of cases? -Yeah, it's been burning a lot of oil. Oh, yeah, I got a couple decals that will cover that decal up real good. That's good. Thank you, Dennis. You're welcome, Phil. Phil, I see you're ready for racing, I see, but with the wrong spark plugs. Let's get these Champions in this thing. I've been thinking about Champion, Arnold, you know, and if I can get some for my tow car... I think I can just put those decals on here, you know? I need a few boxes for my tow car. Let's get these on first and I'll get some pugs for you. [Phil] I'll get them right in here. [Arnold] And then, we'll fix up your truck. -It's gonna look great, Arnold. -[Arnold] Good enough. [disco music] [Fred] But most, everybody else is here for racing. To get ready for the Baja. [music continues] There were big names. Parnelli Jones, ready to take his crack at the desert, to see if this Blazer is ready for the Baja. [engine revving] It's 400 miles of rugged desert, sagebrush and hard rock. Parnelli's new axle travel holds up, the Blazer hits 130 mph and doesn't bottom out. [music continues] Parnelli never did like to use his horn. [music continues] Other racers are ready to go on the course. The team of Rick Mears and Doc Sauers. That's a big one. [car revving] [music continues] [Fred] Malcolm Smith, the motorcycle champion, is moving in on the four-wheelers [music continues] Malcolm and his partner, Bud Feldkamp are already thinking past the Mint to the Baja 1000. Hollywood stunt driver, Bobby Ferro in his sand master dune buggy. there are seven checkpoints along the course and every racer knows he's going to make pit stops. [ragtime piano music] Hello, boss. [Fred] Walker Evans is the other half of the Parnelli Jones' racing team. [engine revving] [disco music] When the dust settles again in the Nevada desert, there's a new winner: Bobby Ferro. [people screaming] But the others will have their crack at him again at the Baja 1000. [clapping] I had a couple of places I wanted to see before I hit the Baja. [country music] For one, Terre Haute, Indiana, and the national Tractor Pull contest. with over a million dollars in prize money every year, when they aren't plowing, they're pulling. [music continues] Everybody knows a tractor is for off-road work. But if anyone thinks that these farmers in the Midwest can't be competitive with those big rigs of theirs, they got to talk to Janice Hoffer here. You bet they are, Mr. Gordon. Terre Haute is just one of the number of competitions we go to every year. They're not gonna race around the course, are they? Oh, hardly. The idea is to see who can pull a predetermined weight the farthest. [Janice] Big ideas to get the most traction they can. Some farmers have ballast to get up to the last ounce of allowable weight Here's how it works. A sled is attached to the rear of the tractor. Then, when the tractor starts up, an artificial weight of 5,000 pounds is mechanically transported in the rear of the sled to the front, at full transfer. This builds up to a dead weight of 50,000 pounds. [engine revving] -[explosion] - Some poor man just burned $15,000 worth of tractor engine. [engine revving] [engine revving] [Fred] These machines don't look like any tractors I've ever seen. [Janice] Oh, you're right. A lot of invention goes into these tractors. Some people put thousands and thousands of dollars into their machines. [man] We don't have too much in this because it came out of a junkyard. And we did all the work. I take a lot of the guys take them somewhere. And some other guys spend $10,000 just to get their engines working. [man speaking indistinctly on microphone] [engine starting] [Janice] Oh, here's a friend of my dad's who built his tractor for under $300. [metal clanking] [Fred] This guy may have built a $300 tractor, but those tires, they got to be $1,000 a throw. [engine revving] [explosion] [commentator] That's it! We took off and went about 30-40 foot. And... if you run lean on fuel, it sets the fuel up the intake and boom. [bluegrass music] [Janice] You'll see all kind of propulsion today. Diesels, dune buggy engines, even blown engines that burn nitromethane to develop up to 2,000 horsepower. Recognize that? It's a jet that turns out 10,000 horsepower. [commentator speaking on microphone] [Fred] Terre Haute is just one of the many stops in the tractor pull circuit from Connecticut to Colorado. From Ontario to Florida. Today, it's this man with the trophy. Tomorrow? Well, tomorrow is another day and another fairground. For me, tomorrow was Yakima, Washington, where the Yakima Ridgerunners hold their annual Jeep Rodeo. [engine purring] It's sort of like a private war. You know, Bob? You could probably consume just as much beer without the race. But here in the northwest, they go for strong motivation. They like to spice up that drinking with a little organized mayhem. -I wouldn't say this is mayhem. -Oh, you wouldn't? -That's not what I heard. -Okay, it's not mayhem but it is the meanest, filthiest race you can find on God's green earth. We race modified carts. [Fred laughs] You mean modified engines? [Bob] Well, we play a little with the front ends, turn them into battering rams to eliminate the competition. When the race starts, you want all the protection you can get. Most of the course is underwater, except in the dry season, when it's hip-deep in mud. -[engines revving] -[bluegrass music] When we remember, we run four hits in each of four classes. ["Jeep Ridge Runners" by Alan Oldfield playing] You got to be alert and quick up there. If you ain't, you're gonna know it pretty damn soon enough. [laughs] Somebody oughta throw water on them. [music continues] We adapt all the tricks in racing: Stirling Moss called this thing tailgating. We do it one better. [music continues] The only real equipment you need here is a strong stomach and a real deep streak of meanness. You know what I mean? [laughs] Hey, come on up and show us. [Fred] It's almost half a continent from Yakima to Ensenada, and a whole world of attitudes. But this was the place where I knew I had to be. By the time I got there, the impound area was filling up with over 500 vehicles ready for inspection before they took off on what many think is the toughest off-road course in the world. The last few days, thousands of men and women will be a part of this race and the vehicles around the course have been pouring into town. [mariachi music] [motorcycle revving] [singing in Spanish] You can't get everybody, much less anybody, to agree just when this race was first held. But it was in 1966-67 that of a bunch of the boys got gassed, decided to dare each other to drive the length of Baja, from Tijuana to La Paz. But progress caught up with the racers. The Mexican government paved the road. Now, every year they have to follow a different course. Now, Now, they start here and they cut over here and come down through here, through Mike's Sky Ranch, up through the mountains a first time, down to San Felipe. And they cut straight up through the desert, swing over here, come through the mountains a second time before they come back. If they get back. [engine revving] Now, the fun and games are over. You've driven the course for the last time. There's nothing more you can do to your machine in the impound area. [harmonica music] By nightfall, there are probably 20,000 people at the various checkpoints spread over a 1000-mile course. It's a long hard day ahead. It's a time for contemplation, for quiet, for rest. [people whistling and laughing] And if you're lucky, you can get close enough to the bar and who songs for some last-minute bench racing. [people clapping and cheering] 6:00 a.m. The motorcycles take off and the Baja is underway. [funk music] [motorcycle revving] Now, it's the cars turn. [engine revving] Bobby Ferro. His win at Las Vegas makes him the man to beat. The team of Doc Sauers and Rick Mears. Doc drives the first leg and Rick will pick up halfway through. [engine revving] Mickey Thompson is driving today with a broken back. A special air hose to his helmet let's Mickey breathe filtered air. Parnelli Jones starts 45th. [engine buzzing] Walker Evans starts right behind Parnelli. They leave in one-minute intervals. [engine revving] [tires screeching] [engine revving] [car accelerating] [engine revving] [disco music] [engine revving] [music continues] [engine revving] Part of the tradition of the Baja is local participation. Here some Ensenada kids add an extra bump to the course just beyond a blind right-hand corner. Parnelli knows the kids, he's driven too many of these races. S o, he gives them a show. [music continues] Around the course are seven checkpoints. As a driver goes through these positions, his progress is radioed to race headquarters. And the data fed into a special computer, so, they can figure a lapse time. He's a dog . -[man] Fred, any news? -Yeah? Yes, they're the hell down there. God knows when they'll be here. The information comes down the various checkpoints. Right now, we're at Tres Hermanas, one of the last checkpoints. By the time the racing cars get here, there will be fewer of them. All we can do is to listen for names that we know. And wonder what it's really like out there under that hot baking desert sun. [music continues] [David] There's a lot of times out there in a race where you say to yourself "What am I doing? I have holes in my hip. I mean, this is not fun." But when you're able to hit a stretch that doesn't have too many rocks and you can swipe the car around and do a little driving or something, then you get your thrill out of it. [ music continues] [Fred] Another racer has his own ideas. [Malcom] Some guys will tell you the worst is the sun. For my money, the damn dust. You just can't tell where you are or what's ahead of you. [music continues] [music continues] [Mickey] You know, you head starts wondering. You think "Am I on the course?" Did I miss a marker. And then, you see somebody broken down and you know you're still on the race. [music continues] [Al] The rush is when the guy comes up behind and you can't see him or hear him and he comes crossing into you. [laughs] That will shake you up. [Fred] We try to listen. it's early but already we know the Baja is taking its toll. [man speaking on the radio] You wonder how many of them will ever get here to use this gas. [music continues] [Malcom] You want to know what you do if your tire goes flat or you lose one? You got no choice. Three wheels is better than two. Well, I'll tell you what they look like. About four hours into the race, all those cars start looking like a bunch of wounded insects. Oh, I must have been crazed. I mean, well, I come around the corner and I see my engine is on fire, right? Well, I get so wild, I forgot completely I bought this new fire extinguisher. Thing set me back $300. And I'm out there, on my hands and knees trying to blow out the fire. [music slows down] [music resumes] [men speaking indistinctly] Watch it, watch it. Here. [crackling] [men speaking indistinctly] [mechanical noises] Okay. [man] We need a carburetor. [engine revving] [music continues] [Fred] Report comes in from Mike's Sky Ranch Ferro is out in front and pushing hard, but Parnelli is closing on him fast [music continues] [music slows down] [Malcom] You gotta look out for each other out there. One mechanic, one look out. You can get yourself wiped out in one big hurry. There are some guys who just going nuts out there. The Baja really gets them. [Mickey] Well, I tell you, you gotta keep going. I caught a flat, had to scrounge a spare from a guy. It was the wrong size, but it beats sitting down on that mountain side. [music resumes] [David] Every now and then, you see something really shakeshit. Well, it helps to get back where you ought to be . [donkey braying] [music continues] [Al] You really feel great when you hit the dry lake. I mean you can cook 130-140, flat out. [man speaking on radio] It was easy to figure. Guys like Bobby Ferro and Walker Evans were on the dry lake and making time. [music continues] [music continues] We get the word Parnelli's out. Then, word flashed along the course. Bobby Ferro crosses the finish line with a new record. [people cheering] [man speaking indistinctly] [whistling] You had any trouble besides that? [men speaking indistinctly] [Fred] But in the Baja, you race against the clock. Walker Evans still has a chance to take it all. Walker is pushing all the way, but it's not good enough by four minutes. [man] Watch out! Come on! He settles for a second overall, but first in his class. [people whistling and clapping] [man] How is it going? [man] A lot of people broken down out there, Walker? Yeah, just cars everywhere. Just about four miles or five miles back, I missed a turn. I don't have a bit of brakes. [men speaking indistinctly] -[women laughing] -[man] My hero! -It's pretty hot, huh? -Yeah. Thirty five years old, huh? Gave me a lot of trouble out there. Hi there, man! [laughs] -I told you I'd do it, didn't I? -[laughs] Didn't I tell you? -[man] Pretty tired? -Yes! [music continues] [soft instrumental music] [Fred] There are a lot of guys still out on the course. Still racing. Will be till 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. [music continues] [Mickey] When the sun goes down, it's... It's pretty easy to get lost down there. I know most guys are just wandering around, half of them just looking for the course. It gets pretty hairy out there. [music continues] [motorcycle revving] [Malcom] Well, I tell you I don't like it when it starts getting dark. Well, there I was, up in the hills. And it's dark, and it's cold and I'm freezing. Jesus, it's murder in the dark. You're so tired, it's painful. your eyes ache, your hands are numb around the steering wheel. But you know you gotta keep going and if anybody ever asked me why, I'll coldcock them. [woman screaming] All right! That's Mickey! [man] Who knows what happened to them. [woman speaking indistinctly] [men speaking indistinctly] -I'm so proud of you! -[laughs] Thank you very much. -What? -[man] How does it feel? You have it all over with. -Betcha. -[laughing] I've never been so glad to get to a place in my whole life. -Hey, Darryl! You made it! -Hey! [women laughing] [exclaims] -No top. -Yeah. [people screaming] [cheering and whistling] [people cheering] -How are you guys? -I'm ahead everybody, I think. [people cheering] [clapping] [woman] Oh, my God! You did it! You did it! [shrieks] [soft instrumental music] [man] Would you do it again? Oh, for sure. -[Spanish] Ora! -Thank you! -[men laughing] - Gracias. [men laughing] -My face's dirty? -[man] Just a little. Well, this is a mudpack. I'm going to be gorgeous tomorrow. [birds singing] [Fred] You hang around the finish line until dawn, the second day. If the driver of a team hasn't made it home by then, you know another piece of machinery is gonna be a part of the desert landscape. Most of these guys will be back next year . And there'll be some other fellows that try it for the first time. Whatever the course is, it's still a Baja. They'll be back, and I'll be back. Because this is my people. This is my world.
