- Hi. - Hello. Hi. Technically, you didn't do anything wrong, Ruby. But you still disobeyed some very important instructions. I was just cleanin'. Did they tell you that you weren't to go into the school side of the building? Or the nursery? I was cleanin'. You were to clean the chapel and the church offices. Nowhere else, correct? - Am I in trouble? - No, Ruby. You just don't have a job there anymore. Does this mean I don't get my vouchers anymore? No, no, no. This doesn't change any of that. - Okay. - You'll still get your assistance. Look, we'll set up some more interviews in the next couple weeks. Until then, there's a resume workshop and a class on... Oh, let me see... What's next week? "Making a home budget." You need to attend those classes in the other building. All right, here's the schedule. Thank you. How's Gensan? Still liking his job? ♪ Every time I open my eyes ♪ ♪ I just wanna kill somebody I wanna kill somebody ♪ ♪ K-k-kill somebody ♪ What up, Big Mike? It's your show now, baby. Whatever, man, I hate this shithole. Good night, Gensan. See ya. Hey, man. Can I get two of these Baby Ruths, pack of them Buglers, and, uh, let me get a couple of them one-dollar scratchers. What are his odds? There you go. ...completely turned my life around and just get me back on track. Why didn't you just do what you were supposed to do? - I was trying to do a good job. - Bullshit. I thought if I did extra good and cleaned more than they said, that maybe I could get a raise and get us some more money. Bullshit. Mr. Rio says there's probably another something just around the corner. Your kid's down there. No. You lying to me? What? There's something just around the corner. Dear God, please let this scratch card be a winner because I really need the money right now. Thanks, Amen. Bud, it's a winner. It's a winner. A free ticket. It's still a winner. Music is what saved me. I mean, my dreams of making it... ...is what made me turn my life around. Yep, I'm going on here. I'm freaking out about it.

Hey. cause she couldn't be any more comfortable in her shoes. Down to the final two. It's been a long, hard road for both of you emotionally, physically, willfully, but you're here, you made it.

We're in the apartment. We're in the apartment. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. You're safe. You're safe. Shh. What up? I need to see you in my office. I got three hot tickets, yo. Mike can get it. Hey, do you want some candy? This is tough. I just don't like to see things like this, but, um, okay, here it is. Uh, basically, corporate has been determined to turn us into carry-out and delivery exclusively. You know, it's a bottom line thing. Almighty dollar, you know. They just don't see, in their model, restaurants like ours anymore. You know, they think that families don't go out to dinner as much as they used to and... so they want to take our operation and... I don't, I don't even know what. I mean, they're closing our restaurant. And they're gonna open a much smaller space down the block on Vermont. And it's gonna be exclusively carry-out and delivery. Carry-out's where they say the bulk of our business is, anyway, but I don't... you know, I don't see it. I'm gonna be managing there, but they're only gonna give me payroll for three kitchen staff. It's company policy. There's nothing I can do. But I'm gonna put my feelers out there, you know. Any managers looking for a good cook, great cook. I went ahead and made out your last paycheck. So that's... That's it. I'm sorry, Gensan. No, no, he took off about a couple of hours ago. We're gonna close the store. I don't know. Yo, I need to make my move, man. What do you want? Him. What are his odds? It's a long shot, man. You give me 250. I got it, man. Put it away, man, okay? They've already collected for the night. It's too late. You know where? Way out. City of Industry. Where? Look, you don't want to go out there, man, okay? Just wait till next weekend. - Besides, this guy's a loser. - Tell me. Come on, man. Bud! - Hey, what's the matter? - Where you been? - What's the matter? - Where you been? I was worried about you. Where were you? Mr. Seal told me they're closing your restaurant. I don't care. I was trying to call you. Didn't you hear me calling you? Nope. I need to have a phone. It's not fair, you always get the phone. You always lose 'em. I won't anymore. - Are you mad at me? - Mm-mm. I'm sorry about my job. You ain't gotta worry about that no more. Uh... I need to tell you something. I did something. Gen, I need to tell you something. Okay. - Gen, listen to me. - Honey, please stay. I gotta go out for a couple hours, and when I come back, everything is gonna be good, I promise. Hey, man, what's up? Yo, uh, Paco said... It's... It's cool. I'll take everybody's money up in here. I got you. I got you. Uh, I want to bet on the one with the green feather over there. Yo, man, I want to put a bet on the one with the green feather? Paco sent me. Paco? Heh. The store over on Beverly in the city. Paco? Paco's una idiota. I don't... I don't... I don't... I got... It's... That's my bet. Oh, come on! Fuck. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! All right, on the ground! Get on the ground! On the ground! Give me your hands! Get down on the ground, right now. I didn't do shit, man. Give me my money! Give me my money, man. Come on! Come on! Come on, man. Just come on. Give me my money! Ah! ♪ You are the sunshine after the rain ♪ ♪ You are the cure against my fear and my pain... ♪ Glen, I need you to do something for me. - Can you do something for me? - Yeah. - Glenn? - Yeah? Listen, man, I need you to go to my place and tell Ruby to pack a duffel bag full of clothes, and then take the Vermont bus south to 128th. Can you do that? Glenn? What? You gotta tell her to be cool. They may already... I don't know. Just tell her to hurry and take the Vermont bus south to the last stop. I'll be there waiting. - Can you do it? - Yeah. Vermont bus south to the last stop. Thanks, man. Hey, hey. Hey. Goddamn it. Hey, come... Come on! Come on. Let's go. - What the heck, Bud? - Shh. Just put that in the back and get in the car. Hurry, come on. Who's car is this? It doesn't matter. Buddy, are you okay? - It's not mine. - Whose blood is it, Gen? I told you that we were gonna be good, and I was right. I had this feeling like everything was about to change, but we gotta go, okay? We can't come back here. We can't be around here. We're gonna go someplace else for a little while. But, Gen, I gotta tell you something. Rube, we're good. I mean it. We are good. She just left the baby alone there in her apartment and, and the baby was crying. How do you know that she left it alone? How do you know that she wasn't in her room or taking a shower, you dummy? Don't call me that. We'll just go back and take her back. You don't understand, there's people that are looking for me now, Ruby. How do you know that she didn't already call the cops? I'm sorry, Buddy. You're so dumb. I'm not dumb. Dumb, dumb. Dumb! Oh, shit. She's not there anymore, and I don't know where she is. I... I can't tell you... Somebody took her. Somebody took her. What do you think she needs? Do you think they got milk in there? What else? Maybe diapers? Do you think she likes milk? What do you think she likes? Gen? Do you think she...? Do you think she likes something else? Mmm. Huh? Need some gas, too. - Which pump? - Seven. - And all this? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. Looks like somebody's up late. She had her nap. - She's beautiful. - Thank you. What's her name? How... How much...? Uh, $52.50. Thanks. They got cameras here, you idiot. She needed these things. You don't know what you're talkin' about. Gensan, she's hungry. Her diaper's dirty. Do you have any idea how long you go to prison for kidnapping? I didn't kidnap her, she was alone. We're going to the hospital. You can leave a baby at a hospital and they can't ask any questions. That's the law. But... But they got cameras there, too, Gen. God...! It stinks. Do not roll that window up. But it's starting to rain. I can't breathe. I don't have anything to clean her butt with. I didn't get any wipeies at the store. - We need to go back. - No. I'm not stopping until we get to Arizona. Arizona? What's in Arizona? God, throw that diaper out. It smells like shit. I need something to wipe her butt. - Here. - Ugh, this has blood on it! So? I'll use this old shirt. - What shirt? - It's just an old shirt. Don't use that shirt. I like that shirt. Hey, hey. You're gonna feel better in a second. I'm gonna feed you and you're gonna be happy, okay? Okay? - Gensan? - What? Sorry. Her diaper's clean, she just ate again. I think she might have a bellyache. What's the matter, baby? Huh? What's the matter? You stay here. Where you goin'? Bud, where you goin'? Do not get out of this car. Bud! No. No. No. Listen to me, get back in that car right now. - No. - Somebody's gonna find her any second. We will sit here and we will make sure. I promise you, somebody good. They'll call the cops and they will take her back where she belongs. No, she gets left alone back there, and she can't go back there. She can't. Then they'll take her someplace good. - I promise. - You know you can't promise that, Bud, you know that. - Things are different. - How? Just get back in the car, please. Ruby, goddamn it! Shh, it's okay. Mommy's here. It's okay. You get in this car right now, Ruby. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. - Ruby, get in this car. - I'm not givin' her up, Gensan. - You're acting crazy. - You know she's not yours. - Leave us alone. What are you gonna do? Don't worry about me. Goddamn it. Um, yeah. Absolutely. And the interesting thing is, is we look at that, and we judge it, we condemn it, and as we go, "Oh, no..." Sorry, I didn't... I didn't realize you were over there. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. ...small-minded human going on. Well, that makes sense. And if that's the case, then... What are you doing? No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. What are you...? What if you wanted what your soul needed? Fine. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - Here you go... Is she hungry? Yeah, but I don't have her bottle. It's in the car. All her stuff is in the car. You're not feedin' her yourself? What do you mean? Nobody come to your mom's house? It's my house, too, man. Nobody come to your house? No, man, they think it's the kid's dad. What? The cops think it was your neighbor's ex took the kid. How do you know that? My mom watches the news at breakfast. - Do they know nothin' about me? - What about you? Nothin'. Where are you? I gotta go. Okay, got you some things. - Found a good formula. - What? It's a little more expensive, but it has all the nutrients - and stuff she needs. - Wow, thank you. And, um, you know, just a little toy. - Oh! Heh. - Do you like that? There you go. That's for you. - Hey, babe, we gotta go. - Buddy, this is Penny. - How do you do? - She got us this for Gayle. - Did she? - Uh-huh. She's really gorgeous. Give Penny a kiss now, Gayle, huh? - Say thank you, Penny. - Bye. Thank you, Penny. - Bye, pretty girl. Bye! - Bye-bye! - Nice to meet you. - Bye. Drive safe. Did you tell her our last name, too? Huh? - Did you tell her everything? - No, she didn't even ask. - She's a good person. - Bullshit. Ruby, I... - Uh, wait. - Shit. Sorry, I know this is crazy, but, um, here's my phone number and my address. Just, I don't know, keep me posted - on how your trip is going to California. - Okay. And if you guys need anything, let me know, - or if Gayle needs something. - Thank you. Where's, um, where's the car seat? You gotta have a baby seat for her. It's the law. Yeah, no, we had the good kind, but the baby got sick and shit all over it, so we had to throw it out. - It's really important. - Okay. - You promise? - Promise. Thanks, Penny. - Bye. - Bye. You're going the wrong way. She said that store was back towards... Shh, get low, please. Don't let nobody see you with her. Just lay down. But we gotta get a seat. We gotta get further east before I can stop. Where are we going? Albuquerque. Albuquerque? And what's in Albuquerque? Nothing, we gotta get through Albuquerque to get to 54, and then you take 54 up from there. Take that up to where? The 54 goes to... Gensan, we're taking the 54 up to where? Don't worry about it. I got it. Gen, I'm not going back there. Not with her, I'm not going back. Hot damn, man. That's like 50 bucks. Yeah, but it comes with a cart and everything. That one's 35 and that one's 45. That one's cheap. That one's more badass. It's got, like, a blue racing stripe. It doesn't matter what color it is. Yeah, but I like it. It's cool. Look, it's got this extra bar for extra safety. And this says it's got this thing that you click down in the seat. I mean, that's the way. Shit, it's only ten bucks more, you know? Yeah, I know. Damn, look at all this shit. - You want me to try? - Would you please just... Would you give me a minute? I said that I could do it in a minute. It's been, like, 30 seconds and you're down my back. Um, it's been, like, nine minutes. Rube... I got it. Can we change it? Something softer for the baby?

I did it five times today changing the diapers. Better get used to changing diapers, too. I'm not doing all the poop. No way. It's gotta be... What the fuck is wrong with you? - No, what? - Come here. Ow. Ow. Ow! Ow! You think that's not gonna burn her? - Ow! - She's a baby, you dummy. You'll burn her damn skin off. Let go! Ah! Ow.

I'm supposed to tell you that you guys aren't gonna be in any trouble if you just give her back. You gotta, like, take her to a police station or something. No, way. This one time Ruby got picked up for shoplifting. - Ruby shoplifted? - She didn't do it, man. I don't know. She was playing with some kid at the mall in Glendale. I don't know, man, she gave the kid a Teddy bear, and the mom was all weirded out by her, so the people at the store said she stole a Teddy bear. Where were you? I turned around for two seconds, man. Some mall pigs took her back to a security office. Took me 20 minutes to find her. By the time I finally found her, she's, like, layin' on the ground. She... peed all over herself. Where you at? I don't know. Somewhere, I don't know. Where you goin', man? Alaska. How the hell are you getting to Alaska? What do you mean? You could drive there. They got, like, fishing boats and stuff. Hey, man, look, I just wanted to... I gotta go. - What were you doing? - Taking a leak. Bathrooms were on the other side. Bathrooms were on the other side! Quiet! I'm not going back there, Bud. Please don't make me. Ruby, you don't gotta go back there, I promise. - I have to go there real quick. - I'm not going. - I told you... - And she's not going. She can't go there or even close to there. Uh-uh. I'm not taking you anywhere near there, Ruby, I promise. I'll do it by myself. I don't want you to. Just once, that's it. Then it's just gonna be the three of us, all new, someplace they're never gonna think to look for us. I got a plan. - You got a plan? - I got a plan. Our wallets, everything. Credit cards, IDs, everything. How much for a night? - Single or double? - Single. We don't have any available right now. Okay, double. $49.95 plus tax. We'll stay for the night. We'll be out early. Can't authorize a room without a credit card or ID, sir. I can ask my manager, if you want. She's pretty strict. Who is it? They kept calling when you were in the motel. Do you know who it is? Shit! Don't yell. You're making her more upset and she's got a bellyache. - You don't know that. - Yes, I do. She keeps rubbin' her belly. Maybe she's just not getting what she needs. Yes, she is. This formula has all the vitamins and everything - that she's supposed to get. - Bullshit. Baby's supposed to get what it needs from its mother. Shit! Fuck. Two hundred bucks? Piece of shit. They got HBO. No, they don't. I'm sorry. Bud. What are you sorry about? All this. You two gonna be all right for a second? Mm-hmm. We're fine. You're going back, you're going back, you're going. What the fuck are you doing? Nothing. - What is wrong with you? - Nothing. What the fuck, Ruby? What...? I thought maybe I could get it to work. She's mine now, so I thought it might work. - It doesn't work like that. - You don't know. I do know it. You gotta be pregnant for that to work. - You gotta have a baby. - You don't know. I do know! Well, you won't let me. - Dummy. - Don't call me that. Dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dummy. I love you. And I love her. I know. I want her healthy and happy. She smiles at me. She knows me. We're gonna be all right. I didn't used to think that. I always thought we were just fucked, all the time. But you don't anymore? Mm-mm. What are we gonna do? I just gotta do one thing in the morning, and then we're gonna go, the three of us. We just gotta be smart, all right? Okay. You know, the cops catch us, they'd take her away and they'd split us up, forever. But they can't do that, can they? I won't let 'em. What the shit? You can't be here. The fuck I can't. Where is he? You tell him to get his ass out here. You dumb fuck, you don't even know. I got more right to this house than anyone. Here we go. You're a beautiful, beautiful little girl, yes, you are. You are, you're so beautiful. Okay, here we go. We're gonna wrap you up, beautiful, little lady. Huh? Ready? They sent him up to Lansing five, five and a half years ago. - Same shit? - Yeah. They got him on aggravated. Couldn't get him on enticement, 'cause she was 15. If she was 14, they'd have thrown away the key, but... Should've anyway. So that's where he is. Well... He was in, like, 18 months, then he died. Emphysema or some shit. Good riddance. Look, we can play catch-up here all day long, but... I'm telling you, we gotta figure out what the fuck you and Ruby are gonna do. I got a plan. I want what's owed to us. I can sell it and get us out of Dodge, and then they're never gonna see us again. - How's that? - Them old Winchesters and that old Sharp he had were worth about 20 grand. Nah, he sold 'em. Well, there's about ten grand in old bonds he stole when he worked for Northeastern, and they're down in the basement in that crawl space. No. He traded 'em. He had all kinds of legal fees and bullshit. And I hurt my back, retired from driving a truck, and he got picked up same year. How much is the house? It's a piece of shit. It's falling down. 60 grand? I mean, you can have it. We'll sell it, but that takes time, man. You haven't got time. You can't keep that baby, man. If you do that, it's kidnapping and I think that's federal. We can take care of it. "It"? You fucking kidding me? You can't take care of a baby. Her name is Irene. No, her name's Olga or some shit. I saw it on the news. They got security cam pictures of you and Ruby in some fucking store looking like fucking crack heads. With your dad's record, them people are... nervous. They think me and... They think... No, they just... This is fucked up. Shh. Cool it. Now, you listen to me. You bring that baby back, you give it to the cops. They see that it's fine, and you'll be fine. I can't let 'em lock her up, Uncle Doug. Ruby's not... She wouldn't... She's not like other people. I know, Gen. But there's no way you're gonna get out of this without doing some time. Shh. Shh, come on. Shh, baby. The longer you let this go, the worse it's gonna be. Shit, Uncle Doug. I'm sorry, Gen. There's nothing right that's ever been done for you two. Nobody knew what was going on up in there. I mean, my sister would tell me, "He's a sick son of a bitch," but she was your mom, man, and then she just left you two with him. She didn't leave us. He killed her, and then he dumped her out by the old house in DeSoto. We don't know that. Doesn't matter anyway. You listen to me, man. You let me help you. You go in, you do a little pinch. When you get out, I'll try to help you get a commercial license. I still know some guys. But what about Ruby? We'll take care of her. I promise you that. But it might be good for you guys to be apart. I mean, you haven't been apart since you were babies. It ain't right, Gen. You know that. It's not natural. Those cops figure out the way you guys been living, there's no court gonna have mercy on your soul. I ain't got one, Uncle Doug. He beat it out of me by the time I was 11... Ruby's about eight. Stole us about five or six baby turkeys. I was in charge of keeping them in this pen. Made it out of wire behind that old house in DeSoto. Those were me and Ruby's turkeys. And one morning, he was... doing it on top of Ruby. And then, he made me do it to her too. Then I go down and check on them turkeys and... some raccoons had got their little hands through the wires and had been pulling on 'em all night. They was half alive, just laying there, like half a wing or no legs, just... bleeding. He come down, whupped my ass. Then he give me an old shovel, and he told me put 'em out. And... I said I didn't want to do it, but he said he was gonna put Ruby back in the dryer if I didn't, so I did it. And some of those little turkeys just wouldn't go, Uncle Doug. I had to whack 'em like five or six times. I'm sorry, Gen. But you gotta trust me. It's the only way you're gonna get through this. I'll do it, but you gotta let me handle Ruby... I got her hiding. I'll go get Ruby and the baby, and I'll bring 'em to the house, and then you tell the cops we'll meet 'em there. They gotta be real gentle with Ruby, okay? And you gotta tell 'em that I did it. Ruby didn't have nothing to do with taking that baby. Shit. There's cops out front. Go out the back. Black Chevy pickup. Keys are on the floor. Please don't cry. Come on. It's okay, I'm... Shh. Quiet. Shit. Come on, Irene, please. Be quiet! Be quiet. Oh, my God, come on. Ruby. I just got her to sleep. Can't get pulled over without a car seat, Buddy. Okay. Penny said... said they'll lock us up in a second. I'll get one. Is this part of the plan, Gen? Is this a plan? Yeah. Okay. Rube? Yeah, I'm ready. Are you okay? Gonna be all right. - Promise? - I promise, Ruby. Okay. I told you it's gonna be good. It's good. Okay? You should slow down, Ruby. I love her. I know you do. And I love you. I'm sorry, Gensan. I'm sorry. "Dear Buddy, you are my knight in shining armor, Gensan. You're my Superman. I love you so much that I think, sometimes I think that it's too much for me, like I wasn't supposed to be born. But now I know that I was. I was supposed to be born so that I could have you and we could have each other and help each other make it through. And now we have Irene, too. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I made it hard for us. I know we're gonna get a nice house that's like our house in DeSoto, but nobody else, with the trees and the pond and all the dogs and all the baby animals. I love you, Buddy." ♪ Irene ♪ ♪ Good night ♪ ♪ Irene ♪ ♪ Good night ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ I'll kiss you ♪ ♪ In my dreams ♪ ♪ I asked your mother for you ♪ ♪ She told me you was too young ♪ ♪ I wish to the Lord I'd never seen your face ♪ ♪ I'm sorry you was ever born ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ I'll kiss you in my dreams ♪ ♪ Sometimes I live in the country ♪ ♪ Sometimes I live in town ♪ ♪ Sometimes I take a great notion ♪ ♪ To jump in the river and drown ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ I'll kiss you in my dreams ♪ ♪ Stop ramblin' ♪ ♪ Stop your gamblin' ♪ ♪ Stop staying out late at night ♪ ♪ Go on home to your wife and your family ♪ ♪ Sit down by the fireside bright ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ I'll kiss you in my dreams ♪ ♪ I love Irene, God knows I do ♪ ♪ I love her till the seas run dry ♪ ♪ But if Irene turns her back on me ♪ ♪ I'll take morphine and die ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Irene, good night ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ Good night, Irene ♪ ♪ I'll kiss you in my dreams ♪
