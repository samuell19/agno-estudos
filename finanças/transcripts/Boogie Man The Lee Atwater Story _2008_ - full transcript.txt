[ NO SOUND ] [GUNSHOTS] [RAPID FIRE] [TYPEWRITER CLICKS] [TYPEWRITER DINGS] [TYPEWRITER ROLLING UP] [ DRUMMING ] -ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE THE WHOLE THING. [ BAND PLAYS ] -I, RONALD REAGAN, DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR... -I, RONALD REAGAN, DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR... -...THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. -PRESERVE, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. -SO HELP ME GOD. -SO HELP ME GOD. -YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET. -♪ SO I'M A BAD BOY ♪ ♪ I'M A LONG, LONG WAY FROM HOME ♪ ♪ WELL, I'M A BAD BOY ♪ -CAN YOU UNDERSTAND AMERICAN POLITICS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND LEE ATWATER? I BELIEVE NOT. -HE COULDN'T TEACH ME RHYTHM, BUT HE DID TEACH THE DEMOCRATS TO SING THE BLUES, AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE JUST STARTING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -HE MATTERED IN AMERICAN POLITICS BECAUSE OF THE MAN HE GOT ELECTED, BECAUSE OF THE PARTY HE SHAPED. HE WAS VERY IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY TO GEORGE H.W.'S VICTORY BUT TO HIS SON'S VICTORY. -LEE ATWATER WAS PART MYTH, PART SHOWMAN, AND PART POLITICAL MASTERMIND. HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE. -ROVE WAS THE PROTEGE OF LEE ATWATER. HOW DO POLITICS REALLY WORK? HOW DOES A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REALLY WORK? THE DEPTHS OF IT DESERVE TO BE EXAMINED CLOSELY. -RACIST. -DISGUSTING. -SCUMBAG POLITICS. -GARBAGE. -AND I'M A VERY LOVABLE GUY. -[ LAUGHS ] -GOSH, WHAT A PERSON MADE DUE FOR A LIVING. NOW, HE PLAYED BLUES. HE MY MAN. [ LAUGHS ] I LIKE HIM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -IT WAS A GREAT STORY NOT BECAUSE OF POLITICS. IT'S AMERICAN YEARNING AND STRIVING TO BE ACCEPTED, TO BE POWERFUL, TO BE GREAT, AND THE PERSONAL RISKS OF DOING THAT. LIFE GETS EVEN WITH YOU IN THE END. -PRIDE. SIN. REDEMPTION. LEE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE NATIONAL POLITICAL SCENE, AND YOU HAD TO WONDER, WHAT NEXT? I'VE HEARD IT DESCRIBED AS SOME KIND OF GREEK TRAGEDY. LEE ATWATER GREW UP IN A STANDARD, SOUTHERN-LOOKING, WHITE LIFE. HE PIERCED THROUGH ALL THAT. I'D HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN THIS GUY OPERATE AT THE GRADE-SCHOOL LEVEL. I MEAN [LAUGHS] THAT'S WHERE YOU LEARN POLITICS. -HE COULD JUST GET A CROWD INTO A FRENZY. WE WERE JUST A SO-SO BAND, BUT WE HAD LEE, THE ONLY GUY I KNEW WHO COULD DO A SPLIT. -JUST THINK IF YOU'D HAVE STAYED WITH THE UPSETTERS REVUE WHAT YOU COULD HAVE BECOME. -YEAH, I COULD HAVE BEEN MAKING $65 A NIGHT. -HE TOOK THIS ONE GUY AND RAN HIM AS PRESIDENT OF THE SCHOOL. NOBODY HAD EVER HAD A CAMPAIGN MANAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL. -AND THEY WON! YOU KNOW? HE FIGURED OUT EARLY ON THAT MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO BE THE CANDIDATE BUT THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES GUY. -WELL, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, I JUST SAY, "WELL, IF THESE GUYS ARE THE DEMOCRATS, I'M A REPUBLICAN." -I ASKED LEE, WHY DID YOU GO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE FUDDY-DUD, COUNTRY-CLUB SET? LEE SAID, "HEY, MAN, I HAVE A LOT BETTER CHANCE AT DOING SOMETHING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY." -IF THE GRAND OLD PARTY STAYED KIND OF GRAND AND OLD, IT WASN'T GONNA BE MUCH OF A PARTY. IT HAD TO GO YOUNG. WITHOUT THAT, WE WOULD GO INTO THE WILDERNESS. -THE POWER WAS JUST WAITING TO BE WIELDED, AND HE WAS GONNA WIELD IT. -AT NEWBERRY COLLEGE, WHERE I ATTEND, WE SIGNED UP OVER 12,000 SUPPORTERS FOR PRESIDENT NIXON, WHICH IS A NATIONAL RECORD AT THIS POINT. -ISN'T IT A SHAME THAT HE DIDN'T DECIDE TO BECOME A DEMOCRAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS EASY FOR HIM. HE DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE ANY OF THOSE THINGS. AND YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A REBEL. AND ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO ENORMOUS RICHES. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOT OF FUN. -LEE BUILT AN ARMY OF COLLEGE REPUBLICANS ALL OVER THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. FIRST, HE TOOK OVER SOUTH CAROLINA AND THEN WENT NATIONAL. -NICE TO MEET YOU. THE LIBERAL ALLEGATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN, COLLEGE REPUBLICANS ONLY CARE ABOUT THE RICH OR WE'RE CLOSET FASCISTS OR WE'RE PEOPLE WHO HATE THE HUMAN RACE. -FREE BOOK IF YOU SIGN UP FOR ISLAMO-FASCISM AWARENESS WEEK. -LEE ATWATER SHOWED THAT YOU COULD BE A COLLEGE REPUBLICAN AND BE COOL, HAVE MUSICAL INTERESTS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A PINSTRIPED SUIT OR A BOW TIE. -WE ARE THE GRASSROOTS FORCE. YOU KNOW, THE LIBERALS MAY HAVE THE UNIONS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE COLLEGE REPUBLICANS. AND WE'RE HIT WITH LIBERAL BIAS FROM EVERY SINGLE PROFESSOR, SO WE KNOW WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. YOU CAN'T LEARN THESE TYPE OF THINGS IN THE CLASSROOM. IT'S TOUGH AND IT'S DIRTY, OR IT APPEARS TO BE DIRTY. AND KARL ROVE IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF THE WORK THAT COLLEGE REPUBLICANS CAN DO. -THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -1973 CONVENTION. IT REALLY IS A SEMINAL MOMENT IN THIS LITTLE OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE WITH A BUNCH OF COLLEGE REPUBLICANS WHO, AT THE TIME, SEEMED LIKE THE MOST IRRELEVANT FIGURES IN AMERICAN POLITICS. -COLLEGE REPUBLICANS WERE -- WHERE I ACTUALLY FIRST MET ATWATER, WE WERE IN DIFFERENT FACTIONS. HE WAS IN THE KARL ROVE FACTION. -I REMEMBER ONE OF THE GREATEST WEEKS OF MY LIFE, ONE OF THE WILDEST WEEKS OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT IN THE COMPANY OF LEE ATWATER IN A FORD PINTO. -ROVE WAS THE PROTEGE OF LEE ATWATER. HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HIS TURN TO TAKE OVER THE NATIONAL COLLEGE REPUBLICANS. THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY NAMED ROBERT EDGEWORTH, WHO WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE IN LINE TO SUCCEED. THEY GOT INTO A TREMENDOUS, NATIONWIDE BATTLE. -THIS IS THE BIG SHOWDOWN IN MY RACE FOR CHAIRMAN. ALL THE BAD GUYS ARE THE OTHER SIDE. THE VOTE COUNT WAS EVENLY SPLIT. WE WERE GONNA LOSE. -IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT EDGEWORTH ACTUALLY DID HAVE MORE VOTES. LEE ATWATER AND KARL ROVE USED EVERY CONCEIVABLE TRICK. BALLOTS ARE THROWN AWAY UNFAIRLY. -THERE'S NOTHING MORE VICIOUS THAN A YOUNG REPUBLICAN FIGHT -- NOTHING, NOTHING. -THE ELECTION WAS APPEALED TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH. HISTORY IN THE MAKING, HE GAVE THE ELECTION TO ROVE. YOU KNOW, ECHOES OF THE 2000 ELECTION IN FLORIDA WHERE THE BALLOTS ARE DISPUTED AND THE SUPREME COURT MAKES THE DECISION ON A VERY DUBIOUS BASIS. THAT WAS A PRETTY EARLY LESSON FOR KARL ROVE FROM LEE THAT YOU COULD PLAY THE HARDEST OF HARDBALL AND GET AWAY WITH IT. -I MAKE NO BONES ABOUT WHO I AM, WHAT I AM, AND WHAT I DO. IF YOU'RE ON THE OTHER TEAM, I'M GONNA TRY TO BEAT YOU. -LEE SOMETIMES REMINDED ME OF A WOLVERINE SORT OF CHEWING THROUGH THE PLYWOOD, AND HE HAD A VAGUELY MARSUPIAL LOOK ABOUT HIM, ALWAYS SNIFFING THE AIR. -I'VE WONDERED ABOUT WHERE LEE'S STRIVING CAME FROM. LEE GREW UP IN THIS BREW OF RACIAL DIVIDES DRIVING THE COUNTRY. THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL WAR, THE SOUTH'S RISE FROM THE ASHES. AT ITS HEART, IT'S ABOUT LEARNING LESSONS OF DEFEAT. -THE SOUTH IS THE ONLY PART OF THE UNITED STATES EVER THOROUGHLY DEFEATED AND HUMILIATED IN A WAR. IT DOES CREATE A VERY VISCERAL BACKLASH, AND ATWATER WAS ADEPT AT TAPPING INTO THAT. IT WAS A BACKLASHING OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE BETTER THAN YOU ARE. -IT'S THIS CULTURAL RESENTMENT THAT PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH FEEL BECAUSE THESE LIBERALS, THESE SMARTASSES RUN EVERYTHING, AND WE HAVE NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT FOR THEM. LEE'S FRIENDS SAID, "YOU GUYS ALL THINK WE'RE DUMB. YOU HAVE THE SAME KIND OF PREJUDICE AGAINST US THAT YOU ACCUSE US OF HAVING AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE." -THE BIG BOYS TRYING TO PUSH US AROUND, TRYING TO REMIND US HOW MUCH GREATER THEY ARE. "WE'LL SHOW THEM." WELL, LEE HAD A "WE'LL SHOW THEM" KIND OF STRENGTH TO HIM. IT WAS ABOUT AS WIDE AS HIS BACKBONE. RESENTMENT BECAME THE DESTINY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. -I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NEVER EVEN GOTTEN INTO POLITICS IF IT WEREN'T FOR STROM THURMOND. THE PERSONAL INTEREST HE TOOK IN ME AND MY CAREER... -BEFORE STROM, HE WAS, YOU KNOW, "WHERE IS THE NEXT PARTY COMING? LET'S GET DRUNK TONIGHT." WORKING FOR THURMOND TRANSFORMED LEE. -MY GRANDFATHER HATED STROM THURMOND WITH A PASSION. AND I GREW UP WITH THAT SAME HATE. AND WHEN I MET LEE, I KNEW LEE WAS CONNECTED TO HIM. HE'S A PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT HATES US. -GOOD OLD STROM. GOLLY -- 21 YEARS OLD, HAS SEX WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER OF A MAID THERE AT HIS HOUSE, AND PRODUCES A CHILD. AND TO COME OUT AND SAY "THE BLOOD WILL RUN BEFORE WE INTEGRATE" -- IT PERSONIFIES WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE HYPOCRISY OF RACISM. -THE SOUTH IS AFRO-CELTIC. IT'S WHERE YOU FIND THE CELTS SETTLE AND WHERE THE AFRICANS ARE. IT'S A PLACE WHERE THE SAME PERSON WHO'S SAYING, "YES, SIR" AND "YES, MA'AM" TO YOU CAN GO AND GET LYNCH ROPE THE NEXT DAY. SO, I MEAN, THE SOUTH IS COMPLICATED. -THE SOUTH HAS GOT THE SAME THING AMERICA'S GOT, A COMPLICATED HISTORY ON RACE. THERE ARE REASONS TO HATE THINGS ABOUT THE SOUTH AND STILL LOVE THE REGION AND ITS PEOPLE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY DEMOCRAT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT LEE REALLY LEARNED IN HIS EARLY RACES. THEY EXISTED UP IN SOME ELITE LAYER OF THE CLOUDS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT MOVED PEOPLE TO FEEL. THEY SLEPT WHILE LEE OUTMANEUVERED. -IT WAS A CONGRESSIONAL RACE. I WAS A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. HE CAME OUT AND, IN ACCOUNT OF AN UNDERHANDED WAY, IN A SENSE, HE GOT A REPORTER TO ASK HIM A QUESTION ABOUT, WELL, "ISN'T IT TRUE THAT TOM TURNIPSEED HAD SOME KIND OF PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEM AS A KID?" HE WAS THE MASTER AT CREATING LITTLE JUICY TIDBITS FOR THE MEDIA. -WELL, I SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN HOOKED UP TO JUMPER CABLES IN REFERENCE TO A BOUT HE HAD HAD WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IN COLLEGE, WHICH HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC TWO YEARS BEFORE, SO I WASN'T BREAKING ANY NEW GROUND. -THAT GOT QUOTED ALL OVER FROM KINGDOM COME DOWN HERE, LEE ATWATER SAYING THAT -- ACCUSING TOM TURNIPSEED OF BEING HOOKED UP TO JUMPER CABLES. -HOOKED UP TO JUMPER CABLES. I'M LAUGHING NOW, BUT IT AIN'T FUNNY. -ATWATER'S CANDIDATE WON. -IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO BLAME DIRTY TRICKS THAN IT IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE HARD WORK. DID HE GIVE HIS OPPONENTS AMMUNITION TO CRITICIZE HIM FOR NEGATIVE TACTICS? YES. DOES THAT OBSCURE THE FACT THAT HE OUTFOXED THEM AT NEARLY EVERY TURN? NOT TO THOSE OF US WATCHING CLOSELY. -SOUTHERNERS LIKE A GOOD, HARD-FOUGHT POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. HE FIRST MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF ON A RACE BETWEEN CARROLL CAMPBELL AND A DEMOCRAT BY THE NAME OF MAX HELLER. -MAX HELLER HAD BEEN A IMMIGRANT. HE WAS, AS A JEWISH TEENAGER ESCAPING HITLER, AND HE WAS A POPULAR MAYOR. -LEE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ADVOCATES OF THE PUSH-PULL. THE FIRST FEW QUESTIONS ARE ROUTINE. THE NEXT QUESTION IS, "WELL, IF YOU CAME TO BELIEVE THAT GOVERNOR 'X' WAS A PEDOPHILE, WOULD THAT CHANGE YOUR OPINION?" NOW, THE POLLER HASN'T SAID THAT GOVERNOR "X" IS A PEDOPHILE, SIMPLY PLANTED THE IDEA THAT IF HE WERE... -THEY DID A POLL WHICH ASKED, "WOULD YOU VOTE FOR A JEW WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST?" NO, THEY WOULDN'T. -LEE WAS ACCUSED OF RECRUITING A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE, SORT OF A REDNECK-TYPE CANDIDATE, WHO MADE RELIGION AN ISSUE IN THAT RACE. HE SAID HE ENTERED THE RACE ON HIS OWN, BUT NONE OF US REALLY BELIEVE THAT. -HE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE, AND HE ATTACKED MAX HELLER. -I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST. I BELIEVE HE DIED TO SAVE MY SINS. MR. HELLER DOES NOT. -ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME? -I THINK I'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT YOU. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE LORD? -WELL, I... -I'M A LITTLE BIT PREJUDICED TOWARDS PEOPLE AND THE LORD. -LEE ATWATER'S CANDIDATE WON. HE DENIED THAT HE RECRUITED THIS GUY, BUT NONE OF US BELIEVED IT. LEE ATWATER DID NOT LEAVE HIS FINGERPRINTS ON HIS DIRTY TRICKS. HE LIKES TO TAKE AN ISSUE AND USE IT AS A WEDGE -- ABORTION. HE WOULD USE RACE. DIVIDE AND CONQUER. THAT'S HOW LEE ATWATER OPERATED. REAGAN DID POORLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I DON'T THINK RONALD REAGAN WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED IF HE HAD LOST THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY. IT WAS PIVOTAL. REAGAN HAD TO WIN. -THE REAGAN CAMPAIGN NEEDS OPERATIVES. LEE ATWATER WANTED TO ROAR INTO WASHINGTON AND ONTO THE NATIONAL POLITICAL STAGE, BUT YOU GOT TO GET PEOPLE TO WIN BIG GOVERNMENT OFFICE. -LEE ATWATER FIGURED THAT CONNALLY WAS THEIR BIGGEST THREAT. LEE LEAKED THE STORY TO ME THAT JOHN CONNALLY WAS TRYING TO BUY THE BLACK VOTE. THAT STORY GOT OUT THANKS TO ME, AND IT PROBABLY KILLED CONNALLY. HE SPENT $10 MILLION FOR ONE DELEGATE. LEE SAVED RONALD REAGAN'S CANDIDACY. A FEW YEARS LATER, LEE LAUGHED ABOUT THAT STORY. HE SAID, "BANDY, YOU GOT USED." [ LAUGHS ] -ANYTHING GOES. TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. LIE, CHEAT, STEAL, MAKE IT UP. MAKING UP STUFF. HE USED TO GO BACK IN THE ROOM, MAKE UP THESE POLLS. I TELL YOU, HE'D COME BACK WITH A POLL IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR. -GO BACK AND LOOK AT RONALD REAGAN'S 1980 CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT. WHERE DOES HE BEGIN? IN PHILADELPHIA, MISSISSIPPI, WHERE THREE CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS WERE MURDERED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AT THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. REAGAN, SPEAKING TO AN EXCLUSIVELY WHITE AUDIENCE, APPEALED TO THEIR MOST BASE INSTINCTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND LEE ATWATER LATER TALKED ABOUT THAT IN AN INTERVIEW HE HAD IN THE EARLY '80s. HE EXPLAINED THAT IT USED TO BE "NIGGER, NIGGER, NIGGER." YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. YOU HAD RONALD REAGAN TALKING ABOUT WELFARE QUEENS, CODED LANGUAGE. THE EMOTIONAL ISSUES -- I MEAN, THE SYMBOLISM IS SO OBVIOUS. -STROM THURMOND WANTED TO MAKE A CALL TO REMIND PEOPLE WHAT ALL THIS BOY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA HAD DONE. IT WAS IN KEEPING WITH LEE ATWATER'S NATURE TO HAVE IT BE FOR SOMETHING AS BIG AS GETTING INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND PLAYING AT THAT LEVEL. THIS WAS A BIGGER CHALLENGE. THIS WAS A BIGGER PRIZE. -STROM THURMOND WAS TRYING TO GET LEE A JOB IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND, YOU KNOW, HERE'S THIS YOUNG KID WITHOUT A REAL RéSUMé. HE CAME INTO MY OFFICE. HE WAS FIDGETY -- HANDS, LEGS, EVERYTHING MOVING -- BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS EYES. HE HAD THESE PIERCING EYES THAT, YOU KNOW -- AS I OFTEN THOUGHT, THOSE ARE THE EYES OF A KILLER. THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS GONNA GET WHAT HE WANTED. HE SAID, "I'LL GIVE YOU 20 HOURS A DAY." I SAID TO HIM, "I DON'T HAVE A SLOT FOR YOU. I DON'T HAVE A TITLE FOR YOU. YOU'RE GONNA BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RUNG." 24 HOURS -- HE HAD FIGURED OUT HOW TO DETAIL PEOPLE AND CONFISCATE FURNITURE OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S OFFICES. -WE'D BE OUT THERE, RUNNING AROUND THE MEMORIALS, AND HE'D JUST -- "THIS IS WHERE I MAKE MY LIVING, THE MOST POWERFUL CITY IN THE WORLD." -HE WAS GRABBING AS MUCH LIFE AS HE POSSIBLY COULD. EVERYTHING THAT HE ATE -- EVERYTHING -- INCLUDING ICE CREAM, HE DOUSED WITH AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HOT SAUCE. HE SEARCHED THE WORLD TO FIND A SAUCE HOTTER THAN THE SAUCE THAT HE HAD. TABASCO WAS, TO HIM, FOR WIMPS. I WATCHED HIM GROW UP. HE WAS LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER -- HAD GREAT ENERGY. NO ONE EVER OUT-WORKED HIM. HE ATE HIS MEALS THERE. HE WAS THERE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. HE WORKED FOR ME FOR A YEAR. ONE DAY, HE COMES IN. HE SAYS, "I'M BRINGING UP MY WIFE AND MY CHILD." AND I SAID, "LEE, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE MARRIED. YOU NEVER TALKED ABOUT --" HE SAID, "WELL, THEY'RE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I'M GONNA BRING THEM UP." -♪ BRIGHT LIGHTS ♪ ♪ BIG CITY ♪ ♪ GONE TO MY BABY'S HEAD ♪ -HIS HOUSE WAS LIKE A MARX BROTHERS' MOVIE. IT WAS JUST CHAOTIC. ONE CULT MOVIE AFTER ANOTHER -- "ZOMBIES FROM OUTER SPACE." HE WAS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY AN ENTOURAGE. THIS WAS SOMETHING HE AND HIS WIFE FOUGHT ABOUT. I DON'T THINK THEY EVER HAD ANY TIME ALONE FOR THEMSELVES AND JUST WITH THEIR FAMILY. -A LOT OF FAMILIES SUFFER IN WASHINGTON. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT'S IMPORTANT. IF HE COULD HAVE SLEPT ON HIS COUCH AND SHOWERED IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE HOME. -I'VE MET A MILLION OF THEM -- LITTLE POLITICAL ERRAND BOY, VERY AMBITIOUS. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON ARE STILL IVY LEAGUERS, FEELING THAT THE SNOPES FAMILY HAD INVADED, THAT HE HAD GONE TOO FAR, TOO FAST. IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, THEY DIDN'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. HE'S A GUY ON THE MAKE -- DEVIOUS, MANIPULATIVE. -THAT NEED, THAT BURNING NEED TO BECOME SOMETHING AND TRANSFORM AND SHOW THEM. LEE WAS SCRAPPING. WHAT FORCES WILL DRIVE THIS PERSON TO NEW HEIGHTS OR CRASH THEM TO THE GREATEST DEPTHS? HE KEPT LEARNING. -I DO NOT EVER REMEMBER SITTING IN A MEETING IN WHICH SOMEONE DIDN'T BRING UP HOW SUCH-AND-SUCH WOULD PLAY IN THE PRESS. I THINK THERE IS A PREOCCUPATION, AND JUSTIFIABLY SO, ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF POWER IN AMERICA TODAY WITH HOW "A STORY PLAYS OUT" ON TELEVISION. -HERE'S THIS INSECURE KID WHO I'M SURE EVERY DAY HAD THAT TOTAL IMPOSTOR FEAR. "IS ED ROLLINS GONNA FIRE MY ASS TODAY? ARE THEY GONNA FIND OUT THAT I'M REALLY NOT A PhD CANDIDATE? IS SOMEONE GONNA WALK IN AND SAY, 'IT'S ALL BULLSHIT, LEE. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE'"? ANYTHING HE HAD ACCESS TO, HE WOULD ALWAYS GIVE IT TO SOME REPORTER -- EVERYTHING WAS LEAKED. HE WAS A BIG SOURCE. HE KNOWS WHAT THEY NEED. -WHAT ARE YOU SELLING? -NOTHING IN PARTICULAR. -NATIONAL JOURNAL DID A PROFILE, AND LEE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE HAD A RECORD OF 26-0. I SAID, "LEE, WE'VE NOT WON 26 RACES IN THE SOUTH SINCE THE CIVIL WAR." I SAID, "WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT IS THAT?" AND HE GOES, "IT'S MY RECORD NOW. IT'S IN THE NATIONAL JOURNAL." THE MEDIA NEVER CAUGHT ON. HE WAS A VERY GOOD CON MAN. -THE BEST POLITICAL OPERATIVES MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE PRESS. IT'S EASY, IF YOU DON'T WATCH YOURSELF, TO FALL INTO THAT, PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU LIKE PERSONALLY BECAUSE THEY LIKE YOU. -WELL, I MUST SAY YOU ARE A VERY DAPPER DRESSER. -THANK YOU. -YOU GOT THE RIGHT COLLAR, RIGHT TIE WITH THE SUIT, EVEN DOWN TO THE SOCKS. -THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. -[ LAUGHS ] OH, MAN. DON'T YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY IS GAMING YOU? -AN OPERATIVE NEVER COMES AND SAYS, "HERE IS A STORY I'D LIKE YOU TO RUN FOR ME." BUT JUST IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION, "DID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT SO-AND-SO? WE'RE STILL CHECKING IT, MIND YOU, BUT IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TURN OUT TO BE TRUE." WELL, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BEATEN BY YOUR COMPETITION AND WAIT TILL, YOU KNOW, THEY ANNOUNCE IT. THEY JUST PUT IT ON THE CONVEYER BELT, AND YOU JUST RUN IT OUT. -AND I AIN'T GOING TO SIT HERE AND SPIN Y'ALL. THIS IS A HIGH-QUALITY NEWS CONFERENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] -HE WAS AN ATTRACTIVE FIGURE TO COVER 'CAUSE HE COULD WINK AND NOD WITH THE REPORTERS, SAYING, "WE ALL KNOW WHAT A PHONY DEAL THIS IS, RIGHT?" BY SAYING IT'S ALL WRESTLING, HE USED HIS OWN CYNICISM TO ANESTHETIZE PEOPLE TO WHAT WAS GOING ON. -THERE'S A BILL IN THE SENATE CALLED THE CLEAN CAMPAIGN ACT OF 1985. IT'S INTENDED TO RESTRICT THE SO-CALLED NEGATIVE POLITICAL ADVERTISING. -WHAT I THINK YOU WOULD WIND UP DOING IF THIS BILL PASSES IS POLLUTING THE AIR WITH THESE KIND OF CANDY-CANE TYPE COMMERCIALS THAT ARE OOEY AND GOOEY. THEY ARE POLLUTING THE ATMOSPHERE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. -REAGAN BENEFITED FROM HAVING A SCRAPPER TO REMIND EVEN SOME WAVERING REPUBLICANS WHAT THEY SHOULD FEAR. -WE HAD A KIND OF A RATING SCALE OF, ONE, MEANING THAT THIS IS THE KIND THE GUY YOU JUST GO AND BLATANTLY INTIMIDATE IN HIS DISTRICT... -THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT BEGINS TO TAKE NOTICE OF THIS SOUTHERN-ACCENTED, FAST-TALKING KNIFE FIGHTER. EVEN IF YOU THOUGHT HE WAS A RUBE, YOU DID NOT TAKE HIM LIGHTLY. -♪ DEAD MAN WALKING ♪ ♪ DEAD MAN ♪ -I WAS APPOINTED ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE TOLD ME HE WOULDN'T BE LOYAL TO ME, TOLD ME NOT TO PICK HIM, BUT I ADMIRED HIS WORK ETHIC. I ADMIRED WHERE HE CAME FROM. "HOW ARE WE TWO GUYS HERE? MY OLD MAN A SHIPYARD WORKER FROM VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA, YOUR PARENTS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'RE IN THE BIG LEAGUES TOGETHER." I MADE HIM MY DEPUTY. LEE BECAME MY PROTECTOR, MY ANTENNA. HE WAS VERY LOYAL TO ME. I TOLD HIM VERY EARLY ON, "DON'T YOU GET ANY PIPE DREAMS HERE THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MY PLACE BECAUSE YOU WON'T. WE'RE A TEAM." BUT IF YOU LOOKED IN HIS EYES, YOU KNEW THAT THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO BASICALLY WAS GONNA GET WHAT HE WANTED. WHEN HE BETRAYED ME IN '84, IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN, HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH A PRODUCER FOR NBC, AND SO HE CAME IN TO ME ONE DAY AND HE SAID, "WOULD YOU GIVE THEM AN INTERVIEW?" NBC NEWS LED THAT NIGHT WITH THE STORY THAT ED ROLLINS WAS RUNNING A DIRTY OPS OPERATION. -OUR SOURCES, ALL TOP REPUBLICAN STAFFERS, SAY THERE IS AN UNDERCOVER OPERATION LED BY CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR ED ROLLINS DESIGNED TO UNDERMINE THE MONDALE/FERRARO CAMPAIGN. -TOOK ME 35 SECONDS TO FIND OUT THAT, YOU KNOW, HE'D BROUGHT THE PRODUCER IN. IT WAS HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND. LEE HAD PUT A SPEAR IN MY BACK. THE DAY I WALKED IN HIS OFFICE AFTER THIS THING, HE THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM. AND I TOLD HIM. I SAID, "YOU EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO ME AGAIN, I'LL FUCKING BEAT THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF YOU. I'LL FIND YOUR ASS, AND I'LL BEAT THE LIVING FUCKING CRAP OUT OF YOU." -♪ LOVE IS LIKE A GAME ♪ ♪ BUT IT'S SHARP LIKE A RAZOR BLADE ♪ ♪ LOVE IS LIKE A GAME ♪ -IT WAS JUST A TWO-YEAR EFFORT TO DESTROY ME. HE WANTED TO RUN BUSH'S CAMPAIGN. HE WORKED BUSH VERY HARD. HE SAID, "GEORGE W. NEVER TRUSTED YOU, SO I KEPT FEEDING IT." HE CLEARLY MADE IT THAT I WOULD NEVER BE ANYWHERE IN THE BUSH WORLD. -EVERYBODY IS JOCKEYING FOR THE GREAT MAN'S ATTENTION, AND, LET ME TELL YOU, THOSE KNIVES FLASHED BRILLIANTLY FOR A YEAR OR SO. -I HAD PUT SO MUCH TRUST IN HIM. IN SPITE OF EVERYONE TELLING ME YOU COULDN'T TRUST HIM, I TRUSTED HIM. -WHAT CREATES SOMEBODY WHO'S THAT COLD-BLOODED ARE EVENTS IN HIS BACKGROUND AND HIS UPBRINGING THAT LEAVE THEM WITH A VERY BLEAK, REMORSELESS VIEW OF LIFE. -HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT JOE MUCH. HIS MOTHER -- YOU KNOW, SHE HAD A DEEP-FRYER, I THINK, FULL OF HOT GREASE. AND THE LITTLE KID -- YOU KNOW, HE PULLED ON THE CORD AND PULLED THE THING OVER AND... YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT JOE MUCH. -THE GREASE ON THE STOVE ENDED UP ON JOE, AND IT KILLED HIM. -LEE SAID HE HEARD HIS BROTHER'S SCREAMS THE REST OF HIS LIFE EVERY DAY. HOW HAUNTING COULD THAT BE? -HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO MERCY IN LIFE. WHAT KIND OF GOD PRODUCES THIS? GEORGE H.W. BUSH, THE GOOD SON OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, OF TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE AND ACCESS TO POWER AND MONEY, AND HERE LEE ATWATER WAS, THE BAD SEED OF THE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. I THINK THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE WAS BRUTALLY BROUGHT UP SHORT BY THE BUSHES, WHEN LEE MAY HAVE PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED INTO THE MANSION TO SIP THE SHERRY. THE BUSHES NEVER REGARDED HIM AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE HIRED HELP AND A SOMEWHAT UNTRUSTWORTHY MEMBER OF THE HIRED HELP. THEY COULD ALWAYS JETTISON HIM IF THEY HAD TO, CUT HIM LOOSE IN A SECOND. AND LEE WAS PERFECTLY WILLING BECAUSE IT GAVE HIM ENTRéE TO THE WORLD OF POWER AND CELEBRITY THAT HE SO CRAVED. -LYNDON JOHNSON WOULD HUMILIATE HIS AIDES BY HAVING A MEETING WHILE HE SAT ON THE TOILET AND DEFECATED. ATWATER DECIDED TO OPEN HIS PANTS AND URINATE WITH AN ESQUIRE REPORTER, DAVID REMNICK. -LEE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS TO ME BECAUSE ALL HE WAS DOING WAS TALKING TO THE GUY WHILE HE WAS TAKING A PISS, AND REMNICK WROTE IT UP. AND LEE SAID, "WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, SAY 'THIS PISS IS OFF THE RECORD'"? BARBARA BUSH WAS VERY OFFENDED BY HIS VULGARITY. IT ALMOST COST LEE HIS JOB RUNNING THE BUSH CAMPAIGN. -HE HAD TO OVERCOME THE FAMILY SUSPICION. WHO WAS THIS UPSTART? HE'S A KID. SO THEN WHO ARRIVES IN TOWN? GEORGE W. BUSH. THE FAMILY LIKED THE FACT THEY HAD ONE OF THEIR OWN KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON LEE. AND LEE RESPONDED TO THAT BY SAYING, "WHY DON'T YOU COME AND WORK WITH ME, WORK ALONGSIDE ME, IN THE OFFICE NEXT TO ME, AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER IN THIS CAMPAIGN." -SO, HE'S GOT A GUY THERE WHO'S LIVED A LOT CLOSER TO THE EARTH THAN SOME OF HIS RELATIVES. HE AND LEE HIT IT OFF. [ APPLAUSE ] -A TRUE TEST OF A GOOD CAMPAIGN MANAGER IS TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH MY MOTHER. WOULD YOU PLEASE WELCOME A SOUTH CAROLINA CRACKER... LEE. [ APPLAUSE ] -THEY WERE A MAGNIFYING FORCE. THEY WERE BOTH DEEPLY INTELLECTUAL AND WELL-READ. -ATWATER SAID HE READ FOUR BOOKS A MONTH. THAT WAS BULLSHIT. HE DIDN'T READ ONE BOOK A MONTH. HE HAD JIM PINKERTON READ THEM AND TELL HIM WHAT THEY SAID. HE READ, LIKE, THE CliffsNotes FOR FOUR BOOKS A MONTH. -AND MY NUMBER-ONE SOUL MATE AND A GUY WHO'S WITH ME THICK AND THIN -- GEORGE BUSH JR. -HE'S GOT MOJO, LEADER OF THE NEXT CAMPAIGN, THE EYES OF THE WORLD UPON YOU. THIS WAS AN EVEN BIGGER LEAP UP. IT'S EITHER GOING TO MAKE THEM MASTER POLITICIANS, OR IT'S GONNA RUIN THEM. IT'S EITHER GONNA SHOW THEIR WAY TO VICTORY IN THE FUTURE OR SHOW THEM TO THE DOOR. -IRAN-CONTRA MUST HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED BY ATWATER AS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT, ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AND YOUR GUY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. -A CHARGE HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS SHIPPED WEAPONS TO IRAN, TRAFFICKING WITH TERRORISTS. THOSE CHARGES ARE UTTERLY FALSE. -IT'S A LIE. IT'S A LIE. I MEAN, PRESIDENTS LIE. -GIVING WEAPONS TO OUR SWORN ENEMY, IRAN, WHO WE'RE ALL RALLYING THE SABERS ABOUT TODAY. IT'S THE SAME IRAN. -THEY WERE ALWAYS INTERVENING ON BEHALF OF DRUG SMUGGLERS AND TERRORISTS. IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT, IT'S INDEFENSIBLE. BUT THEY WERE SO GOOD AT CONTROLLING THE DISCOURSE. -HE CAME OUT MONTHS LATER AND ADMITTED. -I TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I DID NOT TRADE ARMS FOR HOSTAGES. MY HEART AND MY BEST INTENTIONS STILL TELL ME THAT'S TRUE. BUT THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE TELL ME IT IS NOT. -"THERE WERE SOME RENEGADES IN THE WHITE HOUSE." HE ACTED LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. -I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANY DIVERSION OF FUNDS TO THE CONTRAS. -HE DESERVES OUR SUPPORT, NOT MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT FACED WITH THE DECISIONS HE HAD TO MAKE. -YOU HAD THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS, DOCUMENTS BEING SHREDDED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHY ARE WE DOING THAT? BUT THEN, OF COURSE, ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAD IRANIAN PROBLEMS WAS BECAUSE WE HAD OVERTHROWN THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF IRAN IN 1953. BUSH WASN'T THE ONLY CIA DIRECTOR TO BE UP TO HIS NECK IN DRUG-DEALING, MILITARY LEADERS IN CENTRAL AND LATIN AMERICA. IF YOU COULD AFFORD A UNIFORM AND A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES AND TOLD US YOU WERE ANTICOMMUNIST, WE SUPPORTED YOU. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOWING NORIEGA AROUND THE C.I.A. OFFICE. IT WAS APPALLING. TRUTH BE KNOWN, THE IRAN-CONTRA THING IS THE THING THAT GOT ME INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. [ APPLAUSE ] -VICE PRESIDENT BUSH, DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CONTRA AID OR NOT, SIR? [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] -BUSH WAS REALLY DAMAGED GOODS BECAUSE OF THE SENSE THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN A COVER-UP, SECRETLY PROMOTING A WAR IN NICARAGUA THAT A LOT OF AMERICANS OPPOSED. AND JUST THE DEVIOUSNESS OF THE WHOLE THING RAISED THE MOST SERIOUS POSSIBLE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS INTEGRITY AND FITNESS. -IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER YOUR FRIENDS, WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS GONNA HAPPEN NEXT NOVEMBER IF YOU ARE OUR STANDARD-BEARER AND THESE DEMOCRATS GET AFTER YOU ON THIS SUBJECT? [ APPLAUSE ] -PEOPLE WANT TO GET THIS IRANIAN SITUATION BEHIND THEM. THEY'RE TIRED OF IT. THEY'VE GOT THEIR CHILDREN TO THINK ABOUT. THEY'VE GOT THEIR POCKETBOOKS TO THINK ABOUT. FARMERS HAVE THEIR CROPS TO THINK ABOUT. -HE KNEW THAT, IN ALL PROBABILITY, HIS CANDIDATE HAD BEEN UP TO HIS EYEBALLS IN THIS ACTIVITY. HE'D GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE GAME PRETTY QUICK. -THERE WERE A LOT OF VERY NERVOUS MOMENTS. -YOU SAID IF YOU HAD KNOWN THIS WAS AN ARMS-FOR-HOSTAGES SWAP THAT YOU WOULD HAVE OPPOSED IT. -EXACTLY. MAY I ANSWER THAT? -THAT WASN'T A QUESTION. IT WAS A STATEMENT. -IT WAS A STATEMENT, AND I'LL ANSWER IT. THE PRESIDENT CREATED THIS PROGRAM AS TESTIFIED... -IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY, "THAT'S A LIE." YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS WHEN YOU'RE IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW AND A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING, AND THEY KNOW THIS. THEY'LL JUST SIT THERE AND LIE TO YOU. -AND THIS IS ANOTHER THING LEE HAD A PARTICULAR MASTERY OF IS STAYING ON MESSAGE. BUSH WAS OUT OF THE LOOP. HE WAS OUT OF THE LOOP. THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS IN THE LOOP. THEY COULDN'T BREAK THAT STORY, SO JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT. -IT'S NOT FAIR TO JUDGE MY WHOLE CAREER BY A REHASH ON IRAN. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I JUDGED YOUR CAREER BY THOSE SEVEN MINUTES WHEN YOU WALKED OFF THE SET IN NEW YORK? -WELL, MR. -- -WOULD YOU LIKE THAT? I HAVE RESPECT FOR YOU, BUT I DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE TONIGHT. -BUSH WAS LYING. AND ELLIOT ABRAMS WAS LYING AND CASPAR WEINBERGER WAS LYING AND GEORGE SHULTZ WAS LYING. -SOURCES IN OTHER CAMPAIGNS SPECULATE BUSH'S STRATEGY MAY HAVE BEEN TO SET UP RATHER, THE VICE PRESIDENT ALWAYS PLANNING TO GO ON THE ATTACK. CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT TERENCE SMITH ASKED BUSH CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR LEE ATWATER ABOUT THAT TODAY. ATWATER LAUGHED AND THEN ANSWERED, "WE NEVER TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SAUSAGE." -ONCE YOU GET TO WASHINGTON AND LEARN THE GAME, THE CANDIDATES ARE, A LOT OF TIMES, PUPPETS, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES PULLING THE STRINGS ON THESE GUYS. IN COLLEGE, LEE TOTALLY DETESTED SPORTS, EXCEPT WRESTLING. HIS THING WAS, "THIS IS THE ONLY HONEST SPORT OUT THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY KNEW WRESTLING WAS FAKE. -HE WAS BASICALLY SAYING THAT POLITICS IS PHONY, THAT GOVERNMENT IS PHONY, THAT A LOT OF PERSONAL LIFE IS PHONY. AND "PHONY" WAS A BIG WORD WITH HIM. -HE MAY HAVE FELT THAT WRESTLING WAS THE ONLY HONEST SPORT BECAUSE IT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY DISHONEST. WHAT'S THERE TO ENTERTAIN, WHAT'S THERE TO DISTRACT IS WHAT COUNTS. AND, ACTUALLY, THINGS ARE RUN ON A MUCH MORE CYNICAL BASIS BY THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP. -ATWATER SAYS HE CAN'T RELAX OR TAKE IT EASY BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS PREPARING FOR A MENTAL SPARRING MATCH. -YOU'RE ALWAYS IN A BATTLE OF WITS. THERE'S ALWAYS A BUNCH OF GUYS OUT THERE TRYING TO OUTSMART YOU AND TRYING TO STICK IT TO YOU, AND YOUR JOB IS TO STICK IT TO THEM FIRST. -THE PLAN WAS PRETTY EASY -- WIN IOWA AND WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DOLE. -UNDER THE PRESSURE OF A CAMPAIGN AND UNDER THE HOT LIGHTS OF THE TELEVISION, BOB DOLE MIGHT BE FORCED TO MAKE AN ERROR. LEE HAD THE CAMPAIGN THROW THINGS AT THEIR CAMPAIGN TO PRESS HIM. -THE BUSH CAMPAIGN SAID THIS MORNING THAT SENATOR DOLE BROKE THE JANUARY 13th TRUCE. THE BUSH CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT -- -COME ON. WE'RE NOT GONNA ANSWER -- I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS. -LEE PUT OUT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT OTHERS WERE HEARING VOICES EVERYWHERE. AND HE GOT THEM OFF THEIR GAME BY MAKING THEM ANGRY. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MEDIA BEAST CAN ONLY BE CHEWING ON ONE ANKLE AT A TIME. MAKE SURE THE ANKLE IS THE OTHER GUY'S. -YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF SCURRILOUS, LAST-MINUTE, DESPERATION TACTICS -- AND THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STATE. -DID YOU, IN FACT, SPREAD ANY FALSE RUMORS ABOUT ELIZABETH DOLE? -YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. -I DON'T KNOW. -NO, I DID NOT. I DID NOT. -BOB DOLE SAYS YOU DID. -NO, I DID NOT. -THIS ALWAYS FASCINATED LEE. HE WAS IN A PROFESSION -- YOUR CAREER COULD GET DASHED IN A DAY. YOU KNOW, THAT TOTALLY INTRIGUED HIM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -IOWA HAS TURNED THE REPUBLICAN RACE UPSIDE-DOWN. -IT'S OBVIOUS THAT GEORGE BUSH IS DEEPLY DAMAGED, AND BOB HAS TO BE CONSIDERED THE FRONT-RUNNER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. -WHEN YOU FUCK UP IN THIS ARENA, THE SPOTLIGHT IS AMPLIFIED A THOUSAND TIMES. -WASHINGTON CHEERS FOR TWO THINGS -- THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS TO WIN ON SUNDAY, AND IT CHEERS FOR WHOEVER IS IN POWER TO FAIL. -ATWATER VOMITED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT. LOSING MADE HIM PHYSICALLY ILL. IF THEY LOST NEW HAMPSHIRE, THEY WERE DONE. THEY WERE LOOKING INTO THE ABYSS. I VISITED HIM IN HIS HOTEL ROOM. HE WAS NERVOUS ENERGY. IT WAS SNOWING SO HARD OUTSIDE THAT ATWATER'S RUNNING IN THE STAIRWELL OF HIS HOTEL, UP AND DOWN, UP AND DOWN. -LEE ATWATER WILL EITHER SOLIDIFY HIS IMAGE AS THE POLITICAL WONDER BOY OR BE KNOWN AS THE MAN WHO STEERED PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER GEORGE BUSH INTO THE GROUND. REPORTS SURFACED THAT BUSH WAS PREPARED TO FIRE ATWATER IF HE LOST THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. -SURE, WE'RE CONCERNED. WE'RE OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING DAY AND NIGHT. BUT IN THE END, GEORGE BUSH IS GONNA WIN. -THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE ISN'T NATURALLY COMFORTABLE WITH. IT'S BEEN CALLED, WRONGLY, NEGATIVE. IT WASN'T NEGATIVE. THIS IS PLAY BIG OR GO HOME. -BUSH SAYS HE WON'T RAISE TAXES, PERIOD. DOLE STRADDLES. HE'S BEEN ON BOTH SIDES, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. DOLE ACTUALLY ADVISED... -READ MY LIPS. NO NEW TAXES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -DOLE COULD NOT TAKE THE "NO TAX INCREASE" PLEDGE. IT KILLED HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. BUSH WAS LESS ETHICAL. BUSH TOOK IT. HE LIED. [ LAUGHS ] [ BAND PLAYS "YANKEE DOODLE DANDY" ] -BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY HOW WELL LEE ATWATER, OUR GREAT CHAIRMAN, PERFORMED. HE DID A SUPERB JOB, AND IT'S NOT JUST 'CAUSE HE'S STANDING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S SOMETHING WONDERFUL ABOUT FIGHTING BACK IN LIFE. -WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO TO HIM TO TURN HIM INTO A HIT MAN? -HE WAS NOT A HIT MAN. WHAT HE DID IN THAT CAMPAIGN WAS DISCUSS ISSUES. -BUSH HAD WON IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND TOM BROKAW ON NBC WAS INTERVIEWING THE TWO OF THEM. -AND, SENATOR DOLE, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO THE VICE PRESIDENT? -YEAH, STOP LYING ABOUT MY RECORD. -THE LOOK ON HIS FACE AND THE TONE OF VOICE -- I INTERVIEWED HIM LATER ABOUT IT, AND YOU KNOW, HE SAID, "I LOST MY COOL, AND IT COST ME. YOU WORK FOR TWO YEARS OF YOUR LIFE FOR SOMETHING, AND IT'S TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO SAY, 'GEE, HECK'?" -WE'RE NOT GONNA COMMENT. I DON'T COMMENT ON ATWATER. -THE FACT THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT GOT THE NOMINATION SO OVERWHELMINGLY IS VERY INDICATIVE OF THE KIND OF SUPPORT HE'S GOT IN THIS PARTY. [ CLICKS TONGUE ] [ LAUGHTER ] -I'M HAPPY TO WELCOME ONE HALF OF THAT WINNING TANDEM, THE HONORABLE JOHN BUSH -- GEORGE BUSH. [ LAUGHS ] GOD! -THEY THOUGHT BUSH WAS A WIMP AND A WUSS... ATWATER WAS A HICK AND HACK. -WITH HIS BIG POWERBOAT UP IN MAINE AND HIS UPPER-CLASS BACKGROUND AND BEING FROM YALE, DO YOU THINK HE IS REALLY THE GUY WHO'S GOING TO APPEAL TO THE BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS, THE ORDINARY CITIZENS OF AMERICA? -WELL, BUT YOU JUST NAMED A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ISSUES, AND THIS IS GONNA BE A CAMPAIGN OF ISSUES. -PEOPLE SCOFFED AT THE ATWATER ISSUES -- THE AMERICAN FLAG, THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, AND THE PRISON FURLOUGHS. WHO WOULD BUY THAT? THIS IS SO IRRELEVANT. -AND KEEP THIS COUNTRY GOING. -WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT?! -DEFICIT? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT ABOUT IT. -YEAH! -I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PAYING TOO LITTLE IN TAXES. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING TOO MUCH. -[ SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] -HURRAY! [ CHEERS ] [ ALL CHANTING "GO HOME, BUSH" ] -POOR GEORGE. HE CAN'T HELP IT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS BORN WITH A SILVER FOOT IN HIS MOUTH. [ LOUD LAUGHTER ] -THEY ARE THE PARTY THAT TALKS TOUGH ON DRUGS BUT DEALS SOFTLY WITH DRUG-RUNNING DICTATORS. AND GEORGE BUSH IS A DEAD DUCK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -DUKAKIS WINS BIG EVERYWHERE. HE'S GONNA WIN IN A LANDSLIDE. I THINK HE WILL WIN IN EVERY PART OF THIS COUNTRY. -THE GOVERNOR JUST CAME OUT HERE AND SAID THAT MR. DUKAKIS IS GONNA WIN BIG EVERYWHERE. -WELL, I'M GLAD THEY HAVE THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE BECAUSE THAT LEADS TO THE KIND OF OVERCONFIDENCE AND COCKINESS THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ATTITUDE YOU CAN HAVE IN POLITICS. -WHO'S GONNA -- -BYE! -WAIT, WAIT. ONE MORE QUESTION. WHAT ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENCY? WHEN ARE WE GONNA FIND OUT? -THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. I WILL CONTEMPLATE IT WHEN I GO JOGGING. SEE YOU, GANG. -LEE'S FAVORITE STATEMENT WAS "JUST PLAY DUMB AND KEEP MOVING." [ CROWD CHANTING "FOUR MORE YEARS" ] -THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS PROUDLY CASTS ALL ITS VOTES FOR HER FAVORITE SON AND THE BEST FATHER IN AMERICA, GEORGE BUSH. -REPUBLICANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN DISMISSED AS SLOW, DUMB, AND IT'S ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS WHY REPUBLICANS ARE SUCCESSFUL. LEE LOVED EXAGGERATING THAT IMAGE AND JUST OUTFOXING EVERYBODY AROUND HIM. -IN THE SOUTH, THAT'S CALLED "SLOW-PLAYING 'EM." BEING A SLOW TALKER AND EASYGOING, WELL, A LOT OF NORTHERNERS PERCEIVE THAT AS NOT VERY BRIGHT. SUCK THEM IN, YOU END UP RUNNING ALL OVER THEM. "YOU CAN RUN. YOU CAN RUN. TELL MY BIG BOY WILLIE BROWN. I'M STANDING AT THE CROSSROADS, BABY. I THINK I'M SINKING DOWN." -THIS IS A CRUCIAL, CRUCIAL ELECTION. IF WE LOSE THE PRESIDENCY THIS TIME, WE LOSE IT ALL. -RONALD REAGAN HAD TO HAVE GEORGE BUSH IN OFFICE. IF A DEMOCRAT WON, WE WOULD HAVE A REAL LEGAL PRECEDING, AND RONALD REAGAN COULD HAVE GONE TO JAIL. -DO YOU FEEL THAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS SHOULD MAKE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS PUBLIC? -LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA PICK ON AN INVALID. -MR. PRESIDENT! MR. PRESIDENT! -HE GOT AWAY WITH THOSE KIND OF THINGS 'CAUSE HE DID IT IN A SORT OF JOCULAR WAY WITH HIS IRISH WIT. THAT STATEMENT WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF EVERY NEWSPAPER IN AMERICA. IMMEDIATELY, MICHAEL DUKAKIS' NUMBERS STARTED TO DROP. -HE TRIED TO GET ME TO WRITE ABOUT GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVING PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS. IT WAS REALLY A SLANDER. HE THOUGHT MY WEAKNESS WAS THAT IF I COULD GET AN EXCLUSIVE STORY, I WOULD JUMP AT IT AND BITE AT IT AND NOT BE AS CAREFUL AS I SHOULD BE. WELL, THAT MIGHT BE TRUE, BUT I WAS CAREFUL ENOUGH NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT ONE. -DID YOU GUYS MEET LEE ATWATER OUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER HERE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -PIPE DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] -ENOUGH APPLAUSE. IT GOES TO HIS HEAD. -NO ONE HIRES PEOPLE LIKE LEE ATWATER TO LOSE. THERE ARE NO SILVER OR BRONZE MEDALS IN THIS GAME. AND IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW YOU WIN. IT'S ABOUT WINNING. I'M A FORMER ALTAR BOY. THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS THAT RECRUITS ALTAR BOYS. -YOU DO HAVE TO BE TOUGH TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY. I'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT OF THEM, AND YOU DO HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT THE NORMAL PERSON MIGHT SHRINK FROM. BUT THAT'S IT. WHERE'S THE LINE? WANTING TO WIN MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T CONSIDER IN A NORMAL SENSE. THEY WOULDN'T HIRE LEE ATWATER. TO WIN, THOUGH, THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. -EARLIER THIS WEEK, REPUBLICAN SENATOR STEVE SYMMS OF IDAHO SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD OF REPORTS THAT KITTY DUKAKIS HAD BURNED AN AMERICAN FLAG DURING AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION IN THE '60S. -I SAID IT WAS AN ALLEGATION THAT HAD BEEN TOLD TO ME. -BUT FROM WHO, THOUGH? SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT NATIONALLY. WHO ACTUALLY SAID IT TO YOU? I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, SOMEBODY NEEDS SOME KIND OF FACT. -I WOULDN'T WANT TO DISCLOSE THE SOURCES. -WHAT ABOUT PICTURES? YOU MENTIONED PICTURES. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY PICTURES? -NO, I HAVE NOT. I SAID I HADN'T SEEN THEM. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY SOME VERY RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE PICTURES FLOATING AROUND. -THERE COULDN'T BE A PHOTOGRAPH BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER ANY SUCH INCIDENT. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. IT DID NOT HAPPEN. AND THERE IS NOBODY WHO LOVES THE FLAG AS MUCH AS MICHAEL AND MYSELF. THAT FLAG IS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM, A SYMBOL OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT. -WERE YOU AT A DEMONSTRATION AT ANY TIME? -NEVER. NEVER. -WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON YOUR HEELS AND YOU'RE DEFENDING YOURSELF CONSTANTLY, IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN THE WRONG, AND, THEREFORE, LEE'S CANDIDATE USUALLY COMES OUT LOOKING LIKE HE'S IN THE RIGHT. -AND WHAT DOES DUKAKIS DO? EVERY TIME HE STANDS UP, HE ATTACKS GEORGE BUSH. HE'S A HYPOCRITE. WE ALL KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW IT, TOO. THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE KIND OF OUT-OF-TOUCH CROWD THEY ARE. THEY PROBABLY SAT UP IN BROOKLINE EATING BELGIAN ENDIVES AND QUICHE OUT OF THE CAN AND FIGURED, "WELL, WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GO ATTACK..." -QUICHE OUT OF A CAN! [ LAUGHS ] -THANK YOU! THANK YOU! -SEE, IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S A RING OF TRUTH TO IT. THEY PROBABLY THINK, YOU KNOW, DUKAKIS -- THEY WERE A BUNCH OF ELITISTS. -WELL, OBVIOUSLY, HE AND THE FOLKS AROUND BUSH WERE TRYING TO MAKE ME A KIND OF NORTHEAST LIBERAL WHO WAS OUT OF TOUCH AND THAT KIND OF A THING. I MEAN, THE IRONY OF THIS IS THAT... YOU KNOW, I'M THE GUY WHO IS THE SON OF GREEK IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME OVER HERE AND LIVED THE AMERICAN DREAM. NOTHING AGAINST YANKEE BRAHMANS WHO WERE HERE SINCE 1630. -A NICE WASP KID, BORN IN MILTON. -AND TEXANS WANT A TEXAN FOR PRESIDENT. -TEXANS WANT A TEXAN AS PRESIDENT, NOT SOMEONE FROM MASSACHUSETTS. -BORN IN MASSACHUSETTS. WE LIVED DOWN IN -- GREW UP IN CONNECTICUT. -BUSH COULD EAT PORK RINDS, BUT HE WAS A YALIE AND HE WAS AN ELITE. AND HE MAY HAVE LIVED IN TEXAS, BUT PEOPLE STILL THOUGHT OF HIM FROM CONNECTICUT. LEE WAS THE ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE COUNTRY. -DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU I'M NO TEXAN. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -LEE UNDERSTOOD THE POWER OF IMAGE AND HOW AMERICAN SYMBOLS RESONATE WITH A LOT OF SOUTHERNERS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND DEMOCRATS TO THIS DAY SCRATCH THEIR HEAD AND CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERESTS BY SUPPORTING THESE REPUBLICANS WHEN, IN FACT, THE AUDACITY AND ARROGANCE OF THAT IS PROUD PATRIOTISM TRANSCENDS MONEY. -SMILE. -MR. PRESIDENT! -THE QUESTION I REALLY WANT TO HEAR HIM ANSWER IS, WHY IN THE WORLD DID HE VETO THIS BILL CALLING FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO BE SAID IN OUR CLASSROOMS? CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? GET DOWN HERE, DUKAKIS, AND ANSWER THAT QUESTION! -KIDS SALUTE THE FLAG EVERY DAY. IT'S PART OF THE LAW. I'M ALL FOR IT. THE QUESTION WAS, COULD YOU PUT TEACHERS IN JAIL WHO REFUSED TO LEAD THE PLEDGE? SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT. -WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE? IT'S JUST SHOWING THAT YOU BELIEVE AND YOU STAND BEHIND YOUR COUNTRY. I DON'T THINK THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. -EVERY ONE OF US COULD STAND SOME MORE PATRIOTISM. -WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO MR. BUSH THAT I WASN'T GONNA LET HIM QUESTION MY PATRIOTISM. -I'M NOT QUESTIONING HIS PATRIOTISM. I'M QUESTIONING HIS JUDGMENT. -REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY STRIDENT, ALMOST, IN ATTACKING MIKE DUKAKIS. -NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S STRIDENT. I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT'S A MIS-ADJECTIVE. I WOULD SAY STRONG. -WHAT'S YOURS? -WELL, MINE IS ISSUE CLARIFICATION. -I DON'T LIKE THEM TAKING MY GUN. -WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I WASN'T TAKING PEOPLE'S GUNS AWAY IN TEXAS, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT'S SON, NOW THE PRESIDENT, RAN AROUND TEXAS TELLING THEM THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING. -IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY GUNS HERE, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE A COMMUNIST COUNTRY. -TEXAS REPUBLICANS DIDN'T WASTE A MINUTE. FIVE MILLION LETTERS TOLD TEXAS VOTERS THAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS NOTHING BUT A NORTHEAST LIBERAL, AND THAT'S A CUSS WORD FOR A LOT OF TEXANS. -A LIBERAL IS SOMEBODY WHO WANTS MORE GOVERNMENT, MORE TAXES, MORE SPENDING, MORE REGULATION, AND MORE INTERFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. AND THE ONLY THING THEY WANT LESS OF IS DEFENSE, AND THAT'S THE ONE THING WE WANT MORE OF. -IF YOU LET THE CAMPAIGN BE ABOUT BUSH, YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE LOST. THE CAMPAIGN HAD TO BE ABOUT THE VALUES YOU PROJECT ONTO DUKAKIS. IT WAS AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF THE CULTURE WAR. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TURNED INTO A STEALTH PARTY THAT ARGUES ON BEHALF OF THE COMMON MAN AND GIVES ALL THE BENEFITS TO THE WEALTHIEST 1/10 OF 1%. IT ARGUES ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN MORALITY POLICIES, ENGAGES IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRIVATE BEHAVIOR. HE USED TO DESCRIBE THOSE ANTI-ABORTION FORCES AS THE "EXTRA CHROMOSOME GROUP" AND THE ONES WHO HAD A HAND COMING OUT OF THEIR HEAD, OR A THIRD EYE, YOU KNOW. THOSE WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE MOST DEVOTED PEOPLE TO HIS CAUSE. -A LITTLE LOUDER! -ONE THING LEE TOLD ME, BY THE WAY, THOUGH, IS NEVER, EVER, ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED IN A FUNNY HAT. [ LAUGHS ] -I WAS THERE. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SHOW. -MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS OPPOSED TO VIRTUALLY EVERY DEFENSE SYSTEM WE DEVELOPED. -THE TANK AD WENT DOWN HIS VOTING RECORD. I REMEMBER THINKING, "NOW, WE'VE GOT TO CHECK EVERY ONE OF THESE POINTS." I'M NOT CERTAIN WE DID. -FIRST OF ALL, THE BUSH CAMPAIGN WOULDN'T HAVE PUT THOSE STATISTICS ON THE AIR IF THEY WEREN'T CORRECT. BUT AGAIN, THAT COMMERCIAL IS MORE ABOUT DUKAKIS' RECORD. -I WAS A GOVERNOR. IF THERE WERE BILLS INVOLVING NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENSE IN WASHINGTON, OBVIOUSLY, I WOULDN'T HAVE VOTED ON THOSE. I NEVER SERVED A DAY OF MY LIFE IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. -IT'S WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PRIDE THAT I INTRODUCE MY BIG LITTLE BROTHER GEORGY. DON'T -- [ CHEERS ] I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. FROM NOW ON -- GEORGE TOLD ME THIS MORNING, HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE REFERRED TO AS "JUNIOR." AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE PRIDE IN HIS FATHER AND WHO HE IS, BUT GEORGE HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB ON THIS CAMPAIGN. [ CRASH ] [ LAUGHTER ] -DEMOCRATS! -IT'S DEMOCRATS. -ONE REASON MARVIN AND I AND BROTHER JEB FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA ARE WORKING SO HARD IS BECAUSE OUR DAD NEEDS A REAL JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] -OUR NOW-PRESIDENT BUSH WAS LEARNING A LOT ABOUT POLITICS. THIS WAS A NEW LEVEL OF PLAYING FIELD, AND HE WAS WATCHING A MASTER IN LEE ATWATER. -WHAT GEORGE W. SAW IN LEE WAS AN ATTITUDE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO EXPRESS THE FIRST TIME HE RAN FOR CONGRESS. PROBABLY WASN'T NEARLY MANIPULATIVE AND COLD-BLOODED ENOUGH. HE WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO PLEASE HIS DAD, WHO HE SOMEWHAT MISTAKENLY THOUGHT WAS A GOOD GUY, UNCAPABLE OF TOUGH POLITICS. GEORGE W. WAS SAYING, "NOW I SEE HOW THIS HAS TO BE DONE. DO THE DEAL. DO THE DEED." -SOMETIMES THE SONS CAN SAY SOMETHING THEIR FATHERS CAN'T, AND THAT IS, WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO GO OUT THERE AND KICK SOME OF MICHAEL DUKAKIS AND KICK IT HARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -ATWATER HAD A GENIUS FOR THE STICKY ISSUE... SIMPLE ENOUGH AND SCARY ENOUGH THAT THE MEDIA COULD LATCH ON TO IT. -AS GOVERNOR, MICHAEL DUKAKIS VETOED MANDATORY SENTENCES FOR DRUG DEALERS. HE VETOED THE DEATH PENALTY. HIS REVOLVING-DOOR PRISON POLICY GAVE WEEKEND FURLOUGHS TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDERERS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. WHILE OUT, MANY COMMITTED OTHER CRIMES, LIKE KIDNAPPING AND RAPE, AND MANY ARE STILL AT LARGE. NOW MICHAEL DUKAKIS SAYS HE WANTS TO DO FOR AMERICA WHAT HE'S DONE FOR MASSACHUSETTS. AMERICA CAN'T AFFORD THAT RISK. -I WAS ANGRY.FFORD THAT RISK. I WAS, LIKE, VERY ANGRY 'CAUSE I SAW THROUGH IT RIGHT AWAY. I SAW THE AD WHERE THEY HAD THESE GUYS COMING OUT OF PRISON, AND THE BLACK GUY WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LOOKED UP AT THE CAMERA. SO I SAID, "AH, THESE ARE DIABOLICAL MINDS BEHIND THIS THING." -"THAT'S THE GUY TO BE AFRAID OF." THIS WAS CALCULATED TO EMPHASIZE THE ONE AFRICAN-AMERICAN HERE. -RACE IS A POWDER KEG. IT DESERVES TO BE, IN MANY WAYS. AND LEE GOT CLOSE TO THAT POWDER KEG AND, YOU KNOW, SETTING OFF SPARKS NEARBY. -THIS WAS A PIECE OF LITERATURE THAT WAS BEING DISTRIBUTED IN A NUMBER OF STATES. "ALL THE MURDERERS AND RAPISTS AND DRUG PUSHERS AND CHILD MOLESTERS IN MASSACHUSETTS VOTE FOR MICHAEL DUKAKIS." I THOUGHT IT WAS DESPICABLE. -THEN THEY HAD THE RAPE VICTIM, THIS WOMAN, GO ON TOUR AND TALK ABOUT, IN EXPLICIT DETAILS, WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE RAPE. SHE WAS RAPED TWICE. -IT WAS A SO-CALLED INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE AD WHERE THEY SIMPLY USED HORTON'S FACE. -ONE WAS WILLIE HORTON, WHO MURDERED A BOY IN A ROBBERY, STABBING HIM 19 TIMES. DESPITE A LIFE SENTENCE, HORTON RECEIVED 10 WEEKEND PASSES FROM PRISON. HORTON FLED, KIDNAPPED A YOUNG COUPLE, STABBING THE MAN AND REPEATEDLY RAPING HIS GIRLFRIEND. -THE CANDIDATE AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM DENY ANY RESPONSIBILITY. ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT BELIEVES IN THE TOOTH FAIRY. -I JUST WONDER WHETHER THERE ISN'T A TINGE OF RACISM. -ABSOLUTELY NOT. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I DON'T EVEN THINK MANY PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH KNOW WHAT RACE WILLIE HORTON IS. I THINK THAT'S TOTALLY IRRELEVANT. -I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I THINK HE WAS USED PRIMARILY BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK. LIKE LEE SAID BEFORE HE DIED, YOU DON'T CALL THEM NIGGER, NIGGER, NIGGER ANYMORE LIKE YOU DID 30 YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO BE MORE "SUBTLE" THAN THAT. IT WASN'T VERY SUBTLE AT ALL TO ME. -EVERYBODY SAW HOW PROVOCATIVE IT WAS, AND SO IT GOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FREE AIRTIME. WHO KNOWS HOW MANY TIMES "HOOKED UP TO JUMPER CABLES" GOT REPEATED IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY TIMES WILLIE HORTON'S SCOWLING, ANGRY FACE OF A KILLER WAS TELEVISED ABSOLUTELY FOR FREE. -THERE'S A STORY ABOUT A FELLOW NAMED WILLIE HORTON. -WILLIE HORTON. -CONVICTED MURDERER. -MURDERER. -CONVICTED MURDERER WILLIE HORTON. -WILLIE HORTON. -WEEKEND VACATIONS. -THE WEEKEND PASSES. -COLD-BLOODED. -CONVICTED MURDERER. -FIRST-DEGREE... -CONVICTED MURDERER. -KILLER. MURDERER. -THEY RAPE PEOPLE. -RAPED HIS WIFE. -THEY MAUL PEOPLE. -WILLIE HORTON WILL BECOME A HOUSEHOLD NAME. -NO MORE FURLOUGHS FOR PEOPLE THAT RAPE, PILLAGE, AND PLUNDER! THANK YOU, AND GOD BLESS. -DO YOU THINK THE WILLIE HORTON COMMERCIAL, THOUGH, GIVES HINTS OF RACIAL POLITICS? -I HAVEN'T SEEN THE WILLIE HORTON COMMERCIAL. -YOU DON'T HAVE A WILLIE HORTON COMMERCIAL ON THE AIR? -NO. -A FURLOUGH PROGRAM COMMERCIAL? YOU DON'T HAVE A CRIME -- YOU DON'T HAVE AN AD ON THE AIR ABOUT THE CRIME ISSUE? -NO. -SO THERE'S NO PLAN IN THIS CAMPAIGN AT ALL TO USE THE WILLIE HORTON COMMERCIAL AT ALL TO APPEAL -- -WELL, THERE'S NO WILLIE HORTON COMMERCIAL. I DO THINK THAT THE CRIMINAL FURLOUGH PROGRAM THAT DUKAKIS SUPPORTED, IN WHICH CONVICTED MURDERERS WERE ALLOWED TO GO ON WEEKEND FURLOUGH... -I WENT INTO THE HEADQUARTERS TO SEE ATWATER AT HIS REQUEST. HE LOCKED THE OFFICE DOOR, AND HE POPPED THE FAMOUS WILLIE HORTON SPOT ONTO A TELEVISION. HE SAID, "I GOT A COUPLE BOYS GOING TO PUT A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS UP FOR THIS INDEPENDENT." AND I SAID, "THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE. YOU AND GEORGE BUSH WILL WEAR THAT TO YOUR GRAVE. IT'S A RACIST AD. YOU'RE ALREADY WINNING THIS ISSUE. IT'S WORKING FOR YOU. YOU'RE STEPPING OVER A LINE. YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT." AND HE SAID, "Y'ALL A PUSSY." -THIS MALIGNANT, OVERWHELMING IMAGE OF BLACK MEN -- WE WERE TO BE FEARED. RAISING LYNCH MOBS AGAINST THE BLACK PEOPLE. THIS HAS BEEN THE HISTORICAL ROLE OF THE AMERICAN PRESS. THERE'S SOMETHING DEEP IN THE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS ATTRACTED TO FEAR. I KNOW I LIKE HORROR MOVIES. NOT ONLY POLITICIANS, BUT PEOPLE WHO RUN THE MEDIA, WILL EXPLOIT THIS. -FEAR IS AN ATTENTION GETTER, ANYTHING TO KEEP A STORY GOING. -TERRORISTS, THE HISPANICS, GAYS, COMMUNISTS. -I WAS AMAZED THAT THE DUKAKIS CAMP NEVER SEEMED TO FIND IT IN THEM TO FORCEFULLY EXPLAIN THAT THAT PROGRAM IN MASSACHUSETTS WAS COPIED AFTER A POPULAR STATE WHOSE GOVERNOR WAS THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO SIGN A LAW FOR WEEKEND PRISONER RELEASE. THAT GOVERNOR'S NAME WAS RONALD REAGAN. -TWO OF HIS FURLOUGHEES WENT OUT AND MURDERED PEOPLE, AND HE DEFENDED THE PROGRAM. BUT I NEVER SAID THAT. -WHY NOT? -WASN'T GONNA RESPOND. I MEAN, THAT WAS THE -- THAT WAS THE DECISION I MADE. CRAZY, IN RETROSPECT. CRAZY. [ FOLK MUSIC PLAYING ] -IF YOU DON'T DEFEND YOURSELF AND THEY'RE DOING NEGATIVE ADS AGAINST YOU AND YOU JUST SAY, "OH, I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THAT GAME, I'M GONNA BE POSITIVE," YOU ARE GONNA GET DESTROYED. -RACE IS POISON, BUT IT'S POISON THAT WORKS FOR THEIR SIDE. PEOPLE VOTE THEIR FEARS AND NOT THEIR HOPES, AND LEE UNDERSTOOD THAT. -IT WAS BIZARRE THAT THE WILLIE HORTON CASE BECAME THE FOCUS OF THE ELECTION. -THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AND GOVERNOR MICHAEL DUKAKIS... -THE PRESS LEARNED TO SPEAK THE REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTS WITHOUT EVEN GETTING THEM THROUGH THE FAX MACHINE. -THE FIRST QUESTION GOES TO GOVERNOR DUKAKIS. IF KITTY DUKAKIS WERE RAPED AND MURDERED, WOULD YOU FAVOR AN IRREVOCABLE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE KILLER? -NO, I DON'T, BERNARD, AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT I'VE... -THE QUESTION WAS SO PERSONAL. IT WAS TOTALLY OUT OF ORDER, AND I THOUGHT THAT BERNARD SHAW CONTRIBUTED TO DUKAKIS LOSING THAT ELECTION. -[ CHUCKLES ] YOU KNOW, I KID AROUND AND SAY IF I'D BEATEN THE OLD MAN, YOU'D HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE KID. SO MAYBE IT'S ALL MY FAULT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -I'VE SPOKEN OF 1,000 POINTS OF LIGHT. WE, AS A SOCIETY, MUST RISE UP UNITED AND EXPRESS OUR INTOLERANCE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES OF ENSLAVEMENT TO WHATEVER ADDICTION -- DRUGS, WELFARE, THE DEMORALIZATION THAT RULES THE SLUMS... -"DEMORALIZATION THAT RULES THE SLUMS"? -THERE IS CRIME TO BE CONQUERED, THE ROUGH CRIME OF THE STREETS... -IT'S JUST HYPOCRITICAL FOR HIM TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN, IN HIS OWN FAMILY, HE HAS THIS DEMORALIZATION. HIS SON ADMITS THAT HE HAD AN ADDICTION PROBLEM WITH LIQUOR AND WITH DRUGS. THE BUSH DAUGHTERS. YET THESE ARE PEOPLE ALWAYS LECTURING AFRICAN-AMERICANS ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. -THESE FOLKS SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN PUT AWAY IN JAIL, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER AND BECAUSE GEORGE BUSH WENT INTO OFFICE AND HE GOT TO PICK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE U.S. ATTORNEYS, IT ALL GOT HUSHED UP. AND GEORGE BUSH -- HE'S NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CHIEF LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. [ LAUGHS ] [ APPLAUSE ] -"W" LEARNED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHO WINS. WHATEVER REALLY HAPPENED DOESN'T MATTER. THEY CREATE THEIR OWN REALITY, AS PEOPLE IN THIS BUSH WHITE HOUSE LATER SAID. -LEE WAS THE FIRST GUY I EVER HEARD WHO SAID THAT. IT'S NOW KIND OF ROTE IN POLITICS, BUT LEE WAS SAYING EARLY, "PERCEPTION IS REALITY." LEE WAS AHEAD OF THE PACK. -REPUBLICANS TEND TO BE PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING. THEY JUST WANT TO WIN ELECTIONS. DEMOCRATS, I THINK, HAVE REALLY SINCERE BELIEFS. I THINK THEY'RE ALL WRONG, MOST OF THEM, BUT THEY'RE SINCERE. NOBODY THOUGHT OF GEORGE W. BUSH RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF TEXAS TILL LEE ATWATER PLANTED THE SEEDS, AND THEN HE PLANTED IT WITH HIS MAN IN AUSTIN, KARL ROVE. ATWATER'S A BIG MAN NOW. -[ INDISTINCT SINGING ] [ BLUES MUSIC PLAYING ] [ INDISTINCT SINGING ] [ APPLAUSE ] -RUNS ONE OF THE MOST RACIST CAMPAIGNS IN HISTORY, MARKETING THE WEDGE BETWEEN WHITES AND BLACKS, YET HE ADMIRED AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE... GOT UP IN BLACKFACE. -HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE KLAN. I MEAN, THIS IS THE WAY PEOPLE FELT ABOUT LEE ATWATER. BUT HE TRULY LOVED ME AS A MAN AND AS A BROTHER, AND HE TREATED EVERYBODY ELSE THE SAME WAY. HE LOVED EVERYBODY 'CAUSE HE LOVED THE MUSIC THAT WE WERE DOING. -LEE DIDN'T HAVE A RACIST BONE IN HIS BODY. NEVER HEARD HIM SAY THE "N" WORD. WHEN IT CAME TO MUSIC AND HIS DANCING -- YOU CAN ASK ANYBODY THAT EVER SAW HIM DANCE OR WHATEVER -- LEE WAS A BLACK PERSON IN A WHITE BODY. -♪ OH, YEAH ♪ -THAT INAUGURAL PARTY WAS THE CULMINATION OF LEE ATWATER'S LIFE. HE WAS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. HE WAS THE STAR. ALL THE HISTORY, ALL THE YEARNINGS ALL CAME TOGETHER ON THAT NIGHT. HE WAS DANCING AS FAST AS HE COULD. AND I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT LAY AHEAD FOR HIM. -ONE NETWORK CALLED YOU THE ARCHITECT OF THE EVIL CAMPAIGN. YOU ARE PROUD THIS MORNING OF THE ACHIEVEMENT. ARE YOU AS PROUD OF THE TACTICS? -IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TRULY THOUGHT HE WAS RUNNING A NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN, THEY WOULD HAVE REACTED NEGATIVELY, AND I THINK THAT -- -WELL, I DON'T -- LEE, IN FAIRNESS, I'M NOT SURE THAT'S TRUE. I MEAN, IN POLL AFTER POLL, THEY DID SAY THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN, SAYING MAYBE THE LOWEST TURNOUT IN 64 YEARS, AND FAULTING PEOPLE LIKE YOU. -WAS IT YOU WHO TOLD GEORGE BUSH, "YOU'VE GOT TO RAISE FEAR OF BLACK MEN"? -WE DIDN'T DO THAT. -AND THEY DID WHAT THEY NORMALLY DO WHEN SOMEBODY STANDS UP AND FIGHTS FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES IN, AND THAT'S TRY TO DESTROY THEM PERSONALLY. BUT IT DIDN'T BOTHER HIM A BIT. HE JUST KEPT GOING. [ CHUCKLES ] -HE DESTROYED MICHAEL DUKAKIS. THEY LOVED THAT. THEY DESTROYED THE DEMOCRAT. THEY'D ALL SIT AROUND AND, YOU KNOW, TOAST THEMSELVES AT THEIR HAPPY HOURS THAT THEY TOOK A MAN DOWN. -UPSETTING. I WAS ANGRY -- A WHOLE BUNCH OF -- OF EMOTIONAL FEELINGS. THEY WERE FALSEHOODS. THE UNTRUTH OF ALL THAT WAS VERY DISHEARTENING. -THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GOING NEGATIVE, HOW MUCH NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING, IS TROUBLING. BUT THERE'S A TIME HERE WHEN SOUND POLITICAL JUDGMENT SAYS THIS KIND OF NEGATIVE STUFF MIGHT WORK. DID WE EVER DO IT? YEAH. DID WE FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT IT? NO. -GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH HAS TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS CAMPAIGN. AND HE'S NOT A DUMMY. YOU COULDN'T BE AROUND LEE ATWATER WITHOUT KNOWING HOW HE DID IT. -THOSE WERE RUMORS, AND THEY WERE UNTRUE. THERE WAS NO BASIS IN TRUTH FOR ANY OF THAT. HE WAS ABOVEBOARD AND UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T ANSWER THOSE CHARGES. WE HAVE TO ANSWER CHARGES, CORRECT? -YEAH. -[ LAUGHS ] OKAY. -BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU NEVER SAW GEORGE BUSH I EVER ASK HIM TO STOP. WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY MADE HIM CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. -♪ MOVE ON UP ♪ -LEE ATWATER LOOKS TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PARTY CHAIRMEN IN MODERN TIMES. -♪ MOVE ON UP ♪ -WELL, HE TOLD ME, SITTING IN HIS OFFICE, "IF THERE'S ONE JOB THAT I THINK YOU'D BE GOOD AT, IT'S THE JOB I USED TO HAVE."

I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR STYLE. -BUT ACTUALLY, MY POLITICAL STYLE IS LOVABLE... -WHEN ATWATER BECAME THE RNC CHAIRMAN, THIS POLITICAL PARTY WAS TURNED OVER TO DIRTY TRICKS, THE NEW SPIRIT OF KIND OF RUTHLESS, WIN-AT-ANY-COST REPUBLICANISM. -HE ROSE TO A POSITION THAT MANY OF US COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED HIM HOLDING. -♪ MOVE ON UP ♪ -PEOPLE WOULD JUST COME RUNNING UP.

THE IDEA WAS TO DIRTY UP CLINTON. HE WOULD SIMPLY BE TOO DAMAGED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. DISTRACT AND DIVERT. -LEE RECOGNIZED THE THREAT OF BILL CLINTON AND THE QUALITY OF THE CANDIDATE AND TRIED TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THE GAME AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. -THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS IS EXTREMELY CYNICAL, SHALLOW. THEY CARE ABOUT RIDICULE, THE RUMOR THAT BLACKENS SOMEBODY'S REPUTATION. ALL THAT STUFF IS JUICY. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A REAL SCANDAL, YOU WILL HAVE TO INVENT A PHONY SCANDAL. -YOU HAD ALL OF THESE WACKOS OUT THERE FUNDING ALL OF THESE CRAZY PROJECTS. THAT ALL STARTED WITH LEE ATWATER. WHITEWATER WAS A LAND DEAL THAT BILL CLINTON HAD INVESTED -- I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER, IT WAS LIKE $28,000 -- WHERE HE LOST ALL OF HIS MONEY. THE FIRST INDEPENDENT COUNCIL SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. SO TO THINK THAT THEY PAID KEN STARR AND HIS PERVERTED INVESTIGATIONS, YOU KNOW, $70 MILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY? THESE FOLKS BELIEVE YOU WIN AT ALL COSTS. -ATWATER STARTED TRANSFORMING POLITICS INTO A SERIES OF TABLOID MOMENTS IN A WAY THAT WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL FOR THE REPUBLICANS. -I'D WATCHED POLITICS FOUGHT LIKE WAR UNDER LEE ATWATER. I THINK IT'S HAD SOME BAD EFFECTS ON THE COUNTRY. HE'D HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GET EVERYTHING HE'D GOTTEN IN HIS LIFE. HE WASN'T GONNA STOP. -I AIN'T CHANGED A BIT.

LEE GREW UP IN THIS BREW OF RACIAL DIVIDES DRIVING THE COUNTRY. THE ROLE OF THE CIVIL WAR, THE SOUTH'S RISE FROM THE ASHES. AT ITS HEART, IT'S ABOUT LEARNING LESSONS OF DEFEAT. -THE SOUTH IS THE ONLY PART OF THE UNITED STATES EVER THOROUGHLY DEFEATED AND HUMILIATED IN A WAR. IT DOES CREATE A VERY VISCERAL BACKLASH, AND ATWATER WAS ADEPT AT TAPPING INTO THAT. IT WAS A BACKLASHING OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE BETTER THAN YOU ARE. -IT'S THIS CULTURAL RESENTMENT THAT PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH FEEL BECAUSE THESE LIBERALS, THESE SMARTASSES RUN EVERYTHING, AND WE HAVE NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT FOR THEM.

AND TO COME OUT AND SAY "THE BLOOD WILL RUN BEFORE WE INTEGRATE" -- IT PERSONIFIES WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE HYPOCRISY OF RACISM. -THE SOUTH IS AFRO-CELTIC. IT'S WHERE YOU FIND THE CELTS SETTLE AND WHERE THE AFRICANS ARE. IT'S A PLACE WHERE THE SAME PERSON WHO'S SAYING, "YES, SIR" AND "YES, MA'AM" TO YOU CAN GO AND GET LYNCH ROPE THE NEXT DAY. SO, I MEAN, THE SOUTH IS COMPLICATED. -THE SOUTH HAS GOT THE SAME THING AMERICA'S GOT, A COMPLICATED HISTORY ON RACE. THERE ARE REASONS TO HATE THINGS ABOUT THE SOUTH AND STILL LOVE THE REGION AND ITS PEOPLE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY DEMOCRAT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT LEE REALLY LEARNED IN HIS EARLY RACES. THEY EXISTED UP IN SOME ELITE LAYER OF THE CLOUDS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT MOVED PEOPLE TO FEEL. THEY SLEPT WHILE LEE OUTMANEUVERED. -IT WAS A CONGRESSIONAL RACE. I WAS A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. HE CAME OUT AND, IN ACCOUNT OF AN UNDERHANDED WAY, IN A SENSE, HE GOT A REPORTER TO ASK HIM A QUESTION ABOUT, WELL, "ISN'T IT TRUE THAT TOM TURNIPSEED HAD SOME KIND OF PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEM AS A KID?" HE WAS THE MASTER AT CREATING LITTLE JUICY TIDBITS FOR THE MEDIA. -WELL, I SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN HOOKED UP TO JUMPER CABLES IN REFERENCE TO A BOUT HE HAD HAD WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IN COLLEGE, WHICH HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC TWO YEARS BEFORE, SO I WASN'T BREAKING ANY NEW GROUND. -THAT GOT QUOTED ALL OVER FROM KINGDOM COME DOWN HERE, LEE ATWATER SAYING THAT -- ACCUSING TOM TURNIPSEED OF BEING HOOKED UP TO JUMPER CABLES. -HOOKED UP TO JUMPER CABLES.

NOT TO THOSE OF US WATCHING CLOSELY. -SOUTHERNERS LIKE A GOOD, HARD-FOUGHT POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. HE FIRST MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF ON A RACE BETWEEN CARROLL CAMPBELL AND A DEMOCRAT BY THE NAME OF MAX HELLER. -MAX HELLER HAD BEEN A IMMIGRANT. HE WAS, AS A JEWISH TEENAGER ESCAPING HITLER, AND HE WAS A POPULAR MAYOR. -LEE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ADVOCATES OF THE PUSH-PULL. THE FIRST FEW QUESTIONS ARE ROUTINE. THE NEXT QUESTION IS, "WELL, IF YOU CAME TO BELIEVE THAT GOVERNOR 'X' WAS A PEDOPHILE, WOULD THAT CHANGE YOUR OPINION?" NOW, THE POLLER HASN'T SAID THAT GOVERNOR "X" IS A PEDOPHILE, SIMPLY PLANTED THE IDEA THAT IF HE WERE... -THEY DID A POLL WHICH ASKED, "WOULD YOU VOTE FOR A JEW WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST?" NO, THEY WOULDN'T. -LEE WAS ACCUSED OF RECRUITING A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE, SORT OF A REDNECK-TYPE CANDIDATE, WHO MADE RELIGION AN ISSUE IN THAT RACE. HE SAID HE ENTERED THE RACE ON HIS OWN, BUT NONE OF US REALLY BELIEVE THAT. -HE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE, AND HE ATTACKED MAX HELLER. -I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST. I BELIEVE HE DIED TO SAVE MY SINS. MR. HELLER DOES NOT. -ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME? -I THINK I'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT YOU. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE LORD? -WELL, I... -I'M A LITTLE BIT PREJUDICED TOWARDS PEOPLE AND THE LORD. -LEE ATWATER'S CANDIDATE WON. HE DENIED THAT HE RECRUITED THIS GUY, BUT NONE OF US BELIEVED IT. LEE ATWATER DID NOT LEAVE HIS FINGERPRINTS ON HIS DIRTY TRICKS. HE LIKES TO TAKE AN ISSUE AND USE IT AS A WEDGE -- ABORTION. HE WOULD USE RACE. DIVIDE AND CONQUER. THAT'S HOW LEE ATWATER OPERATED. REAGAN DID POORLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I DON'T THINK RONALD REAGAN WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED IF HE HAD LOST THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY. IT WAS PIVOTAL. REAGAN HAD TO WIN. -THE REAGAN CAMPAIGN NEEDS OPERATIVES. LEE ATWATER WANTED TO ROAR INTO WASHINGTON AND ONTO THE NATIONAL POLITICAL STAGE, BUT YOU GOT TO GET PEOPLE TO WIN BIG GOVERNMENT OFFICE. -LEE ATWATER FIGURED THAT CONNALLY WAS THEIR BIGGEST THREAT. LEE LEAKED THE STORY TO ME THAT JOHN CONNALLY WAS TRYING TO BUY THE BLACK VOTE. THAT STORY GOT OUT THANKS TO ME, AND IT PROBABLY KILLED CONNALLY. HE SPENT $10 MILLION FOR ONE DELEGATE. LEE SAVED RONALD REAGAN'S CANDIDACY. A FEW YEARS LATER, LEE LAUGHED ABOUT THAT STORY. HE SAID, "BANDY, YOU GOT USED." [ LAUGHS ] -ANYTHING GOES. TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. LIE, CHEAT, STEAL, MAKE IT UP. MAKING UP STUFF. HE USED TO GO BACK IN THE ROOM, MAKE UP THESE POLLS. I TELL YOU, HE'D COME BACK WITH A POLL IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR. -GO BACK AND LOOK AT RONALD REAGAN'S 1980 CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT. WHERE DOES HE BEGIN? IN PHILADELPHIA, MISSISSIPPI, WHERE THREE CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS WERE MURDERED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AT THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. REAGAN, SPEAKING TO AN EXCLUSIVELY WHITE AUDIENCE, APPEALED TO THEIR MOST BASE INSTINCTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND LEE ATWATER LATER TALKED ABOUT THAT IN AN INTERVIEW HE HAD IN THE EARLY '80s. HE EXPLAINED THAT IT USED TO BE "NIGGER, NIGGER, NIGGER." YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. YOU HAD RONALD REAGAN TALKING ABOUT WELFARE QUEENS, CODED LANGUAGE. THE EMOTIONAL ISSUES -- I MEAN, THE SYMBOLISM IS SO OBVIOUS. -STROM THURMOND WANTED TO MAKE A CALL TO REMIND PEOPLE WHAT ALL THIS BOY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA HAD DONE. IT WAS IN KEEPING WITH LEE ATWATER'S NATURE TO HAVE IT BE FOR SOMETHING AS BIG AS GETTING INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND PLAYING AT THAT LEVEL. THIS WAS A BIGGER CHALLENGE. THIS WAS A BIGGER PRIZE. -STROM THURMOND WAS TRYING TO GET LEE A JOB IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND, YOU KNOW, HERE'S THIS YOUNG KID WITHOUT A REAL RéSUMé. HE CAME INTO MY OFFICE. HE WAS FIDGETY -- HANDS, LEGS, EVERYTHING MOVING -- BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS EYES. HE HAD THESE PIERCING EYES THAT, YOU KNOW -- AS I OFTEN THOUGHT, THOSE ARE THE EYES OF A KILLER. THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS GONNA GET WHAT HE WANTED. HE SAID, "I'LL GIVE YOU 20 HOURS A DAY." I SAID TO HIM, "I DON'T HAVE A SLOT FOR YOU. I DON'T HAVE A TITLE FOR YOU. YOU'RE GONNA BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RUNG." 24 HOURS -- HE HAD FIGURED OUT HOW TO DETAIL PEOPLE AND CONFISCATE FURNITURE OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S OFFICES. -WE'D BE OUT THERE, RUNNING AROUND THE MEMORIALS, AND HE'D JUST -- "THIS IS WHERE I MAKE MY LIVING, THE MOST POWERFUL CITY IN THE WORLD." -HE WAS GRABBING AS MUCH LIFE AS HE POSSIBLY COULD. EVERYTHING THAT HE ATE -- EVERYTHING -- INCLUDING ICE CREAM, HE DOUSED WITH AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HOT SAUCE. HE SEARCHED THE WORLD TO FIND A SAUCE HOTTER THAN THE SAUCE THAT HE HAD. TABASCO WAS, TO HIM, FOR WIMPS. I WATCHED HIM GROW UP. HE WAS LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER -- HAD GREAT ENERGY. NO ONE EVER OUT-WORKED HIM. HE ATE HIS MEALS THERE. HE WAS THERE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. HE WORKED FOR ME FOR A YEAR. ONE DAY, HE COMES IN. HE SAYS, "I'M BRINGING UP MY WIFE AND MY CHILD." AND I SAID, "LEE, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE MARRIED. YOU NEVER TALKED ABOUT --" HE SAID, "WELL, THEY'RE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I'M GONNA BRING THEM UP." -♪ BRIGHT LIGHTS ♪ ♪ BIG CITY ♪ ♪ GONE TO MY BABY'S HEAD ♪ -HIS HOUSE WAS LIKE A MARX BROTHERS' MOVIE.

I DON'T THINK THEY EVER HAD ANY TIME ALONE FOR THEMSELVES AND JUST WITH THEIR FAMILY. -A LOT OF FAMILIES SUFFER IN WASHINGTON. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT'S IMPORTANT.

A LOT OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON ARE STILL IVY LEAGUERS, FEELING THAT THE SNOPES FAMILY HAD INVADED, THAT HE HAD GONE TOO FAR, TOO FAST. IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, THEY DIDN'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. HE'S A GUY ON THE MAKE -- DEVIOUS, MANIPULATIVE. -THAT NEED, THAT BURNING NEED TO BECOME SOMETHING AND TRANSFORM AND SHOW THEM. LEE WAS SCRAPPING. WHAT FORCES WILL DRIVE THIS PERSON TO NEW HEIGHTS OR CRASH THEM TO THE GREATEST DEPTHS? HE KEPT LEARNING. -I DO NOT EVER REMEMBER SITTING IN A MEETING IN WHICH SOMEONE DIDN'T BRING UP HOW SUCH-AND-SUCH WOULD PLAY IN THE PRESS. I THINK THERE IS A PREOCCUPATION, AND JUSTIFIABLY SO, ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF POWER IN AMERICA TODAY WITH HOW "A STORY PLAYS OUT" ON TELEVISION. -HERE'S THIS INSECURE KID WHO I'M SURE EVERY DAY HAD THAT TOTAL IMPOSTOR FEAR. "IS ED ROLLINS GONNA FIRE MY ASS TODAY? ARE THEY GONNA FIND OUT THAT I'M REALLY NOT A PhD CANDIDATE? IS SOMEONE GONNA WALK IN AND SAY, 'IT'S ALL BULLSHIT, LEE. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE'"? ANYTHING HE HAD ACCESS TO, HE WOULD ALWAYS GIVE IT TO SOME REPORTER -- EVERYTHING WAS LEAKED. HE WAS A BIG SOURCE. HE KNOWS WHAT THEY NEED. -WHAT ARE YOU SELLING? -NOTHING IN PARTICULAR. -NATIONAL JOURNAL DID A PROFILE, AND LEE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE HAD A RECORD OF 26-0. I SAID, "LEE, WE'VE NOT WON 26 RACES IN THE SOUTH SINCE THE CIVIL WAR." I SAID, "WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT IS THAT?" AND HE GOES, "IT'S MY RECORD NOW. IT'S IN THE NATIONAL JOURNAL." THE MEDIA NEVER CAUGHT ON. HE WAS A VERY GOOD CON MAN. -THE BEST POLITICAL OPERATIVES MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE PRESS. IT'S EASY, IF YOU DON'T WATCH YOURSELF, TO FALL INTO THAT, PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU LIKE PERSONALLY BECAUSE THEY LIKE YOU. -WELL, I MUST SAY YOU ARE A VERY DAPPER DRESSER. -THANK YOU. -YOU GOT THE RIGHT COLLAR, RIGHT TIE WITH THE SUIT, EVEN DOWN TO THE SOCKS. -THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. -[ LAUGHS ] OH, MAN. DON'T YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY IS GAMING YOU? -AN OPERATIVE NEVER COMES AND SAYS, "HERE IS A STORY I'D LIKE YOU TO RUN FOR ME." BUT JUST IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION, "DID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT SO-AND-SO? WE'RE STILL CHECKING IT, MIND YOU, BUT IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TURN OUT TO BE TRUE." WELL, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BEATEN BY YOUR COMPETITION AND WAIT TILL, YOU KNOW, THEY ANNOUNCE IT. THEY JUST PUT IT ON THE CONVEYER BELT, AND YOU JUST RUN IT OUT. -AND I AIN'T GOING TO SIT HERE AND SPIN Y'ALL. THIS IS A HIGH-QUALITY NEWS CONFERENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] -HE WAS AN ATTRACTIVE FIGURE TO COVER 'CAUSE HE COULD WINK AND NOD WITH THE REPORTERS, SAYING, "WE ALL KNOW WHAT A PHONY DEAL THIS IS, RIGHT?" BY SAYING IT'S ALL WRESTLING, HE USED HIS OWN CYNICISM TO ANESTHETIZE PEOPLE TO WHAT WAS GOING ON. -THERE'S A BILL IN THE SENATE CALLED THE CLEAN CAMPAIGN ACT OF 1985. IT'S INTENDED TO RESTRICT THE SO-CALLED NEGATIVE POLITICAL ADVERTISING. -WHAT I THINK YOU WOULD WIND UP DOING IF THIS BILL PASSES IS POLLUTING THE AIR WITH THESE KIND OF CANDY-CANE TYPE COMMERCIALS THAT ARE OOEY AND GOOEY. THEY ARE POLLUTING THE ATMOSPHERE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. -REAGAN BENEFITED FROM HAVING A SCRAPPER TO REMIND EVEN SOME WAVERING REPUBLICANS WHAT THEY SHOULD FEAR. -WE HAD A KIND OF A RATING SCALE OF, ONE, MEANING THAT THIS IS THE KIND THE GUY YOU JUST GO AND BLATANTLY INTIMIDATE IN HIS DISTRICT... -THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT BEGINS TO TAKE NOTICE OF THIS SOUTHERN-ACCENTED, FAST-TALKING KNIFE FIGHTER. EVEN IF YOU THOUGHT HE WAS A RUBE, YOU DID NOT TAKE HIM LIGHTLY. -♪ DEAD MAN WALKING ♪ ♪ DEAD MAN ♪ -I WAS APPOINTED ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE TOLD ME HE WOULDN'T BE LOYAL TO ME, TOLD ME NOT TO PICK HIM, BUT I ADMIRED HIS WORK ETHIC. I ADMIRED WHERE HE CAME FROM. "HOW ARE WE TWO GUYS HERE? MY OLD MAN A SHIPYARD WORKER FROM VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA, YOUR PARENTS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'RE IN THE BIG LEAGUES TOGETHER." I MADE HIM MY DEPUTY. LEE BECAME MY PROTECTOR, MY ANTENNA. HE WAS VERY LOYAL TO ME. I TOLD HIM VERY EARLY ON, "DON'T YOU GET ANY PIPE DREAMS HERE THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MY PLACE BECAUSE YOU WON'T. WE'RE A TEAM." BUT IF YOU LOOKED IN HIS EYES, YOU KNEW THAT THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO BASICALLY WAS GONNA GET WHAT HE WANTED. WHEN HE BETRAYED ME IN '84, IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN, HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH A PRODUCER FOR NBC, AND SO HE CAME IN TO ME ONE DAY AND HE SAID, "WOULD YOU GIVE THEM AN INTERVIEW?" NBC NEWS LED THAT NIGHT WITH THE STORY THAT ED ROLLINS WAS RUNNING A DIRTY OPS OPERATION. -OUR SOURCES, ALL TOP REPUBLICAN STAFFERS, SAY THERE IS AN UNDERCOVER OPERATION LED BY CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR ED ROLLINS DESIGNED TO UNDERMINE THE MONDALE/FERRARO CAMPAIGN. -TOOK ME 35 SECONDS TO FIND OUT THAT, YOU KNOW, HE'D BROUGHT THE PRODUCER IN. IT WAS HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND. LEE HAD PUT A SPEAR IN MY BACK. THE DAY I WALKED IN HIS OFFICE AFTER THIS THING, HE THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM. AND I TOLD HIM. I SAID, "YOU EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO ME AGAIN, I'LL FUCKING BEAT THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF YOU. I'LL FIND YOUR ASS, AND I'LL BEAT THE LIVING FUCKING CRAP OUT OF YOU." -♪ LOVE IS LIKE A GAME ♪ ♪ BUT IT'S SHARP LIKE A RAZOR BLADE ♪ ♪ LOVE IS LIKE A GAME ♪ -IT WAS JUST A TWO-YEAR EFFORT TO DESTROY ME. HE WANTED TO RUN BUSH'S CAMPAIGN. HE WORKED BUSH VERY HARD. HE SAID, "GEORGE W. NEVER TRUSTED YOU, SO I KEPT FEEDING IT." HE CLEARLY MADE IT THAT I WOULD NEVER BE ANYWHERE IN THE BUSH WORLD. -EVERYBODY IS JOCKEYING FOR THE GREAT MAN'S ATTENTION, AND, LET ME TELL YOU, THOSE KNIVES FLASHED BRILLIANTLY FOR A YEAR OR SO. -I HAD PUT SO MUCH TRUST IN HIM. IN SPITE OF EVERYONE TELLING ME YOU COULDN'T TRUST HIM, I TRUSTED HIM. -WHAT CREATES SOMEBODY WHO'S THAT COLD-BLOODED ARE EVENTS IN HIS BACKGROUND AND HIS UPBRINGING THAT LEAVE THEM WITH A VERY BLEAK, REMORSELESS VIEW OF LIFE. -HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT JOE MUCH. HIS MOTHER -- YOU KNOW, SHE HAD A DEEP-FRYER, I THINK, FULL OF HOT GREASE. AND THE LITTLE KID -- YOU KNOW, HE PULLED ON THE CORD AND PULLED THE THING OVER AND... YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT JOE MUCH. -THE GREASE ON THE STOVE ENDED UP ON JOE, AND IT KILLED HIM. -LEE SAID HE HEARD HIS BROTHER'S SCREAMS THE REST OF HIS LIFE EVERY DAY. HOW HAUNTING COULD THAT BE? -HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO MERCY IN LIFE. WHAT KIND OF GOD PRODUCES THIS? GEORGE H.W. BUSH, THE GOOD SON OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, OF TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE AND ACCESS TO POWER AND MONEY, AND HERE LEE ATWATER WAS, THE BAD SEED OF THE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. I THINK THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE WAS BRUTALLY BROUGHT UP SHORT BY THE BUSHES, WHEN LEE MAY HAVE PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED INTO THE MANSION TO SIP THE SHERRY. THE BUSHES NEVER REGARDED HIM AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE HIRED HELP AND A SOMEWHAT UNTRUSTWORTHY MEMBER OF THE HIRED HELP. THEY COULD ALWAYS JETTISON HIM IF THEY HAD TO, CUT HIM LOOSE IN A SECOND. AND LEE WAS PERFECTLY WILLING BECAUSE IT GAVE HIM ENTRéE TO THE WORLD OF POWER AND CELEBRITY THAT HE SO CRAVED. -LYNDON JOHNSON WOULD HUMILIATE HIS AIDES BY HAVING A MEETING WHILE HE SAT ON THE TOILET AND DEFECATED. ATWATER DECIDED TO OPEN HIS PANTS AND URINATE WITH AN ESQUIRE REPORTER, DAVID REMNICK. -LEE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS TO ME BECAUSE ALL HE WAS DOING WAS TALKING TO THE GUY WHILE HE WAS TAKING A PISS, AND REMNICK WROTE IT UP. AND LEE SAID, "WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, SAY 'THIS PISS IS OFF THE RECORD'"? BARBARA BUSH WAS VERY OFFENDED BY HIS VULGARITY. IT ALMOST COST LEE HIS JOB RUNNING THE BUSH CAMPAIGN. -HE HAD TO OVERCOME THE FAMILY SUSPICION. WHO WAS THIS UPSTART? HE'S A KID. SO THEN WHO ARRIVES IN TOWN? GEORGE W. BUSH. THE FAMILY LIKED THE FACT THEY HAD ONE OF THEIR OWN KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON LEE. AND LEE RESPONDED TO THAT BY SAYING, "WHY DON'T YOU COME AND WORK WITH ME, WORK ALONGSIDE ME, IN THE OFFICE NEXT TO ME, AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER IN THIS CAMPAIGN." -SO, HE'S GOT A GUY THERE WHO'S LIVED A LOT CLOSER TO THE EARTH THAN SOME OF HIS RELATIVES. HE AND LEE HIT IT OFF. [ APPLAUSE ] -A TRUE TEST OF A GOOD CAMPAIGN MANAGER IS TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH MY MOTHER. WOULD YOU PLEASE WELCOME A SOUTH CAROLINA CRACKER... LEE. [ APPLAUSE ] -THEY WERE A MAGNIFYING FORCE. THEY WERE BOTH DEEPLY INTELLECTUAL AND WELL-READ. -ATWATER SAID HE READ FOUR BOOKS A MONTH. THAT WAS BULLSHIT. HE DIDN'T READ ONE BOOK A MONTH. HE HAD JIM PINKERTON READ THEM AND TELL HIM WHAT THEY SAID. HE READ, LIKE, THE CliffsNotes FOR FOUR BOOKS A MONTH. -AND MY NUMBER-ONE SOUL MATE AND A GUY WHO'S WITH ME THICK AND THIN -- GEORGE BUSH JR. -HE'S GOT MOJO, LEADER OF THE NEXT CAMPAIGN, THE EYES OF THE WORLD UPON YOU. THIS WAS AN EVEN BIGGER LEAP UP. IT'S EITHER GOING TO MAKE THEM MASTER POLITICIANS, OR IT'S GONNA RUIN THEM. IT'S EITHER GONNA SHOW THEIR WAY TO VICTORY IN THE FUTURE OR SHOW THEM TO THE DOOR. -IRAN-CONTRA MUST HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED BY ATWATER AS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT, ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AND YOUR GUY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. -A CHARGE HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS SHIPPED WEAPONS TO IRAN, TRAFFICKING WITH TERRORISTS. THOSE CHARGES ARE UTTERLY FALSE. -IT'S A LIE. IT'S A LIE. I MEAN, PRESIDENTS LIE. -GIVING WEAPONS TO OUR SWORN ENEMY, IRAN, WHO WE'RE ALL RALLYING THE SABERS ABOUT TODAY. IT'S THE SAME IRAN. -THEY WERE ALWAYS INTERVENING ON BEHALF OF DRUG SMUGGLERS AND TERRORISTS. IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT, IT'S INDEFENSIBLE. BUT THEY WERE SO GOOD AT CONTROLLING THE DISCOURSE. -HE CAME OUT MONTHS LATER AND ADMITTED. -I TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I DID NOT TRADE ARMS FOR HOSTAGES. MY HEART AND MY BEST INTENTIONS STILL TELL ME THAT'S TRUE. BUT THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE TELL ME IT IS NOT. -"THERE WERE SOME RENEGADES IN THE WHITE HOUSE." HE ACTED LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. -I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANY DIVERSION OF FUNDS TO THE CONTRAS. -HE DESERVES OUR SUPPORT, NOT MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT FACED WITH THE DECISIONS HE HAD TO MAKE. -YOU HAD THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS, DOCUMENTS BEING SHREDDED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHY ARE WE DOING THAT? BUT THEN, OF COURSE, ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAD IRANIAN PROBLEMS WAS BECAUSE WE HAD OVERTHROWN THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF IRAN IN 1953. BUSH WASN'T THE ONLY CIA DIRECTOR TO BE UP TO HIS NECK IN DRUG-DEALING, MILITARY LEADERS IN CENTRAL AND LATIN AMERICA. IF YOU COULD AFFORD A UNIFORM AND A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES AND TOLD US YOU WERE ANTICOMMUNIST, WE SUPPORTED YOU. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOWING NORIEGA AROUND THE C.I.A. OFFICE. IT WAS APPALLING. TRUTH BE KNOWN, THE IRAN-CONTRA THING IS THE THING THAT GOT ME INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. [ APPLAUSE ] -VICE PRESIDENT BUSH, DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CONTRA AID OR NOT, SIR? [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] -BUSH WAS REALLY DAMAGED GOODS BECAUSE OF THE SENSE THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN A COVER-UP, SECRETLY PROMOTING A WAR IN NICARAGUA THAT A LOT OF AMERICANS OPPOSED. AND JUST THE DEVIOUSNESS OF THE WHOLE THING RAISED THE MOST SERIOUS POSSIBLE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS INTEGRITY AND FITNESS. -IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER YOUR FRIENDS, WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS GONNA HAPPEN NEXT NOVEMBER IF YOU ARE OUR STANDARD-BEARER AND THESE DEMOCRATS GET AFTER YOU ON THIS SUBJECT? [ APPLAUSE ] -PEOPLE WANT TO GET THIS IRANIAN SITUATION BEHIND THEM. THEY'RE TIRED OF IT. THEY'VE GOT THEIR CHILDREN TO THINK ABOUT. THEY'VE GOT THEIR POCKETBOOKS TO THINK ABOUT. FARMERS HAVE THEIR CROPS TO THINK ABOUT. -HE KNEW THAT, IN ALL PROBABILITY, HIS CANDIDATE HAD BEEN UP TO HIS EYEBALLS IN THIS ACTIVITY. HE'D GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE GAME PRETTY QUICK. -THERE WERE A LOT OF VERY NERVOUS MOMENTS. -YOU SAID IF YOU HAD KNOWN THIS WAS AN ARMS-FOR-HOSTAGES SWAP THAT YOU WOULD HAVE OPPOSED IT. -EXACTLY. MAY I ANSWER THAT? -THAT WASN'T A QUESTION. IT WAS A STATEMENT. -IT WAS A STATEMENT, AND I'LL ANSWER IT. THE PRESIDENT CREATED THIS PROGRAM AS TESTIFIED... -IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY, "THAT'S A LIE." YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS WHEN YOU'RE IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW AND A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING, AND THEY KNOW THIS. THEY'LL JUST SIT THERE AND LIE TO YOU. -AND THIS IS ANOTHER THING LEE HAD A PARTICULAR MASTERY OF IS STAYING ON MESSAGE. BUSH WAS OUT OF THE LOOP. HE WAS OUT OF THE LOOP. THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS IN THE LOOP. THEY COULDN'T BREAK THAT STORY, SO JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT. -IT'S NOT FAIR TO JUDGE MY WHOLE CAREER BY A REHASH ON IRAN. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I JUDGED YOUR CAREER BY THOSE SEVEN MINUTES WHEN YOU WALKED OFF THE SET IN NEW YORK? -WELL, MR. -- -WOULD YOU LIKE THAT? I HAVE RESPECT FOR YOU, BUT I DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE TONIGHT. -BUSH WAS LYING. AND ELLIOT ABRAMS WAS LYING AND CASPAR WEINBERGER WAS LYING AND GEORGE SHULTZ WAS LYING. -SOURCES IN OTHER CAMPAIGNS SPECULATE BUSH'S STRATEGY MAY HAVE BEEN TO SET UP RATHER, THE VICE PRESIDENT ALWAYS PLANNING TO GO ON THE ATTACK. CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT TERENCE SMITH ASKED BUSH CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR LEE ATWATER ABOUT THAT TODAY. ATWATER LAUGHED AND THEN ANSWERED, "WE NEVER TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SAUSAGE." -ONCE YOU GET TO WASHINGTON AND LEARN THE GAME, THE CANDIDATES ARE, A LOT OF TIMES, PUPPETS, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES PULLING THE STRINGS ON THESE GUYS. IN COLLEGE, LEE TOTALLY DETESTED SPORTS, EXCEPT WRESTLING. HIS THING WAS, "THIS IS THE ONLY HONEST SPORT OUT THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY KNEW WRESTLING WAS FAKE. -HE WAS BASICALLY SAYING THAT POLITICS IS PHONY, THAT GOVERNMENT IS PHONY, THAT A LOT OF PERSONAL LIFE IS PHONY. AND "PHONY" WAS A BIG WORD WITH HIM. -HE MAY HAVE FELT THAT WRESTLING WAS THE ONLY HONEST SPORT BECAUSE IT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY DISHONEST. WHAT'S THERE TO ENTERTAIN, WHAT'S THERE TO DISTRACT IS WHAT COUNTS. AND, ACTUALLY, THINGS ARE RUN ON A MUCH MORE CYNICAL BASIS BY THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP. -ATWATER SAYS HE CAN'T RELAX OR TAKE IT EASY BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS PREPARING FOR A MENTAL SPARRING MATCH. -YOU'RE ALWAYS IN A BATTLE OF WITS. THERE'S ALWAYS A BUNCH OF GUYS OUT THERE TRYING TO OUTSMART YOU AND TRYING TO STICK IT TO YOU, AND YOUR JOB IS TO STICK IT TO THEM FIRST. -THE PLAN WAS PRETTY EASY -- WIN IOWA AND WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DOLE. -UNDER THE PRESSURE OF A CAMPAIGN AND UNDER THE HOT LIGHTS OF THE TELEVISION, BOB DOLE MIGHT BE FORCED TO MAKE AN ERROR. LEE HAD THE CAMPAIGN THROW THINGS AT THEIR CAMPAIGN TO PRESS HIM. -THE BUSH CAMPAIGN SAID THIS MORNING THAT SENATOR DOLE BROKE THE JANUARY 13th TRUCE. THE BUSH CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT -- -COME ON. WE'RE NOT GONNA ANSWER -- I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS. -LEE PUT OUT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT OTHERS WERE HEARING VOICES EVERYWHERE. AND HE GOT THEM OFF THEIR GAME BY MAKING THEM ANGRY. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MEDIA BEAST CAN ONLY BE CHEWING ON ONE ANKLE AT A TIME. MAKE SURE THE ANKLE IS THE OTHER GUY'S. -YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF SCURRILOUS, LAST-MINUTE, DESPERATION TACTICS -- AND THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STATE. -DID YOU, IN FACT, SPREAD ANY FALSE RUMORS ABOUT ELIZABETH DOLE? -YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. -I DON'T KNOW. -NO, I DID NOT. I DID NOT. -BOB DOLE SAYS YOU DID. -NO, I DID NOT. -THIS ALWAYS FASCINATED LEE. HE WAS IN A PROFESSION -- YOUR CAREER COULD GET DASHED IN A DAY. YOU KNOW, THAT TOTALLY INTRIGUED HIM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -IOWA HAS TURNED THE REPUBLICAN RACE UPSIDE-DOWN. -IT'S OBVIOUS THAT GEORGE BUSH IS DEEPLY DAMAGED, AND BOB HAS TO BE CONSIDERED THE FRONT-RUNNER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. -WHEN YOU FUCK UP IN THIS ARENA, THE SPOTLIGHT IS AMPLIFIED A THOUSAND TIMES. -WASHINGTON CHEERS FOR TWO THINGS -- THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS TO WIN ON SUNDAY, AND IT CHEERS FOR WHOEVER IS IN POWER TO FAIL. -ATWATER VOMITED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT. LOSING MADE HIM PHYSICALLY ILL. IF THEY LOST NEW HAMPSHIRE, THEY WERE DONE. THEY WERE LOOKING INTO THE ABYSS. I VISITED HIM IN HIS HOTEL ROOM. HE WAS NERVOUS ENERGY. IT WAS SNOWING SO HARD OUTSIDE THAT ATWATER'S RUNNING IN THE STAIRWELL OF HIS HOTEL, UP AND DOWN, UP AND DOWN. -LEE ATWATER WILL EITHER SOLIDIFY HIS IMAGE AS THE POLITICAL WONDER BOY OR BE KNOWN AS THE MAN WHO STEERED PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER GEORGE BUSH INTO THE GROUND. REPORTS SURFACED THAT BUSH WAS PREPARED TO FIRE ATWATER IF HE LOST THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. -SURE, WE'RE CONCERNED. WE'RE OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING DAY AND NIGHT. BUT IN THE END, GEORGE BUSH IS GONNA WIN. -THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE ISN'T NATURALLY COMFORTABLE WITH. IT'S BEEN CALLED, WRONGLY, NEGATIVE. IT WASN'T NEGATIVE. THIS IS PLAY BIG OR GO HOME. -BUSH SAYS HE WON'T RAISE TAXES, PERIOD. DOLE STRADDLES. HE'S BEEN ON BOTH SIDES, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. DOLE ACTUALLY ADVISED... -READ MY LIPS. NO NEW TAXES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -DOLE COULD NOT TAKE THE "NO TAX INCREASE" PLEDGE. IT KILLED HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. BUSH WAS LESS ETHICAL. BUSH TOOK IT. HE LIED. [ LAUGHS ] [ BAND PLAYS "YANKEE DOODLE DANDY" ] -BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY HOW WELL LEE ATWATER, OUR GREAT CHAIRMAN, PERFORMED. HE DID A SUPERB JOB, AND IT'S NOT JUST 'CAUSE HE'S STANDING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S SOMETHING WONDERFUL ABOUT FIGHTING BACK IN LIFE. -WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO TO HIM TO TURN HIM INTO A HIT MAN? -HE WAS NOT A HIT MAN. WHAT HE DID IN THAT CAMPAIGN WAS DISCUSS ISSUES. -BUSH HAD WON IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND TOM BROKAW ON NBC WAS INTERVIEWING THE TWO OF THEM. -AND, SENATOR DOLE, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO THE VICE PRESIDENT? -YEAH, STOP LYING ABOUT MY RECORD. -THE LOOK ON HIS FACE AND THE TONE OF VOICE -- I INTERVIEWED HIM LATER ABOUT IT, AND YOU KNOW, HE SAID, "I LOST MY COOL, AND IT COST ME. YOU WORK FOR TWO YEARS OF YOUR LIFE FOR SOMETHING, AND IT'S TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO SAY, 'GEE, HECK'?" -WE'RE NOT GONNA COMMENT. I DON'T COMMENT ON ATWATER. -THE FACT THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT GOT THE NOMINATION SO OVERWHELMINGLY IS VERY INDICATIVE OF THE KIND OF SUPPORT HE'S GOT IN THIS PARTY. [ CLICKS TONGUE ] [ LAUGHTER ] -I'M HAPPY TO WELCOME ONE HALF OF THAT WINNING TANDEM, THE HONORABLE JOHN BUSH -- GEORGE BUSH. [ LAUGHS ] GOD! -THEY THOUGHT BUSH WAS A WIMP AND A WUSS... ATWATER WAS A HICK AND HACK. -WITH HIS BIG POWERBOAT UP IN MAINE AND HIS UPPER-CLASS BACKGROUND AND BEING FROM YALE, DO YOU THINK HE IS REALLY THE GUY WHO'S GOING TO APPEAL TO THE BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS, THE ORDINARY CITIZENS OF AMERICA? -WELL, BUT YOU JUST NAMED A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ISSUES, AND THIS IS GONNA BE A CAMPAIGN OF ISSUES. -PEOPLE SCOFFED AT THE ATWATER ISSUES -- THE AMERICAN FLAG, THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, AND THE PRISON FURLOUGHS. WHO WOULD BUY THAT? THIS IS SO IRRELEVANT. -AND KEEP THIS COUNTRY GOING. -WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT?! -DEFICIT? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT ABOUT IT. -YEAH! -I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PAYING TOO LITTLE IN TAXES. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING TOO MUCH. -[ SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] -HURRAY! [ CHEERS ] [ ALL CHANTING "GO HOME, BUSH" ] -POOR GEORGE. HE CAN'T HELP IT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS BORN WITH A SILVER FOOT IN HIS MOUTH. [ LOUD LAUGHTER ] -THEY ARE THE PARTY THAT TALKS TOUGH ON DRUGS BUT DEALS SOFTLY WITH DRUG-RUNNING DICTATORS. AND GEORGE BUSH IS A DEAD DUCK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -DUKAKIS WINS BIG EVERYWHERE. HE'S GONNA WIN IN A LANDSLIDE. I THINK HE WILL WIN IN EVERY PART OF THIS COUNTRY. -THE GOVERNOR JUST CAME OUT HERE AND SAID THAT MR. DUKAKIS IS GONNA WIN BIG EVERYWHERE. -WELL, I'M GLAD THEY HAVE THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE BECAUSE THAT LEADS TO THE KIND OF OVERCONFIDENCE AND COCKINESS THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ATTITUDE YOU CAN HAVE IN POLITICS. -WHO'S GONNA -- -BYE! -WAIT, WAIT. ONE MORE QUESTION. WHAT ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENCY? WHEN ARE WE GONNA FIND OUT? -THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. I WILL CONTEMPLATE IT WHEN I GO JOGGING. SEE YOU, GANG. -LEE'S FAVORITE STATEMENT WAS "JUST PLAY DUMB AND KEEP MOVING." [ CROWD CHANTING "FOUR MORE YEARS" ] -THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS PROUDLY CASTS ALL ITS VOTES FOR HER FAVORITE SON AND THE BEST FATHER IN AMERICA, GEORGE BUSH. -REPUBLICANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN DISMISSED AS SLOW, DUMB, AND IT'S ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS WHY REPUBLICANS ARE SUCCESSFUL. LEE LOVED EXAGGERATING THAT IMAGE AND JUST OUTFOXING EVERYBODY AROUND HIM. -IN THE SOUTH, THAT'S CALLED "SLOW-PLAYING 'EM." BEING A SLOW TALKER AND EASYGOING, WELL, A LOT OF NORTHERNERS PERCEIVE THAT AS NOT VERY BRIGHT. SUCK THEM IN, YOU END UP RUNNING ALL OVER THEM. "YOU CAN RUN. YOU CAN RUN. TELL MY BIG BOY WILLIE BROWN. I'M STANDING AT THE CROSSROADS, BABY. I THINK I'M SINKING DOWN." -THIS IS A CRUCIAL, CRUCIAL ELECTION. IF WE LOSE THE PRESIDENCY THIS TIME, WE LOSE IT ALL. -RONALD REAGAN HAD TO HAVE GEORGE BUSH IN OFFICE. IF A DEMOCRAT WON, WE WOULD HAVE A REAL LEGAL PRECEDING, AND RONALD REAGAN COULD HAVE GONE TO JAIL. -DO YOU FEEL THAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS SHOULD MAKE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS PUBLIC? -LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA PICK ON AN INVALID. -MR. PRESIDENT! MR. PRESIDENT! -HE GOT AWAY WITH THOSE KIND OF THINGS 'CAUSE HE DID IT IN A SORT OF JOCULAR WAY WITH HIS IRISH WIT. THAT STATEMENT WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF EVERY NEWSPAPER IN AMERICA. IMMEDIATELY, MICHAEL DUKAKIS' NUMBERS STARTED TO DROP. -HE TRIED TO GET ME TO WRITE ABOUT GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVING PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS. IT WAS REALLY A SLANDER. HE THOUGHT MY WEAKNESS WAS THAT IF I COULD GET AN EXCLUSIVE STORY, I WOULD JUMP AT IT AND BITE AT IT AND NOT BE AS CAREFUL AS I SHOULD BE. WELL, THAT MIGHT BE TRUE, BUT I WAS CAREFUL ENOUGH NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT ONE. -DID YOU GUYS MEET LEE ATWATER OUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER HERE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -PIPE DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] -ENOUGH APPLAUSE. IT GOES TO HIS HEAD. -NO ONE HIRES PEOPLE LIKE LEE ATWATER TO LOSE. THERE ARE NO SILVER OR BRONZE MEDALS IN THIS GAME. AND IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW YOU WIN. IT'S ABOUT WINNING. I'M A FORMER ALTAR BOY. THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS THAT RECRUITS ALTAR BOYS. -YOU DO HAVE TO BE TOUGH TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY. I'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT OF THEM, AND YOU DO HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT THE NORMAL PERSON MIGHT SHRINK FROM. BUT THAT'S IT. WHERE'S THE LINE? WANTING TO WIN MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T CONSIDER IN A NORMAL SENSE. THEY WOULDN'T HIRE LEE ATWATER. TO WIN, THOUGH, THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. -EARLIER THIS WEEK, REPUBLICAN SENATOR STEVE SYMMS OF IDAHO SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD OF REPORTS THAT KITTY DUKAKIS HAD BURNED AN AMERICAN FLAG DURING AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION IN THE '60S. -I SAID IT WAS AN ALLEGATION THAT HAD BEEN TOLD TO ME. -BUT FROM WHO, THOUGH? SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT NATIONALLY. WHO ACTUALLY SAID IT TO YOU? I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, SOMEBODY NEEDS SOME KIND OF FACT. -I WOULDN'T WANT TO DISCLOSE THE SOURCES. -WHAT ABOUT PICTURES? YOU MENTIONED PICTURES. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY PICTURES? -NO, I HAVE NOT. I SAID I HADN'T SEEN THEM. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY SOME VERY RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE PICTURES FLOATING AROUND. -THERE COULDN'T BE A PHOTOGRAPH BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER ANY SUCH INCIDENT. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. IT DID NOT HAPPEN. AND THERE IS NOBODY WHO LOVES THE FLAG AS MUCH AS MICHAEL AND MYSELF. THAT FLAG IS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM, A SYMBOL OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT. -WERE YOU AT A DEMONSTRATION AT ANY TIME? -NEVER. NEVER. -WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON YOUR HEELS AND YOU'RE DEFENDING YOURSELF CONSTANTLY, IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN THE WRONG, AND, THEREFORE, LEE'S CANDIDATE USUALLY COMES OUT LOOKING LIKE HE'S IN THE RIGHT. -AND WHAT DOES DUKAKIS DO? EVERY TIME HE STANDS UP, HE ATTACKS GEORGE BUSH. HE'S A HYPOCRITE. WE ALL KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW IT, TOO. THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE KIND OF OUT-OF-TOUCH CROWD THEY ARE. THEY PROBABLY SAT UP IN BROOKLINE EATING BELGIAN ENDIVES AND QUICHE OUT OF THE CAN AND FIGURED, "WELL, WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GO ATTACK..." -QUICHE OUT OF A CAN! [ LAUGHS ] -THANK YOU! THANK YOU! -SEE, IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S A RING OF TRUTH TO IT. THEY PROBABLY THINK, YOU KNOW, DUKAKIS -- THEY WERE A BUNCH OF ELITISTS. -WELL, OBVIOUSLY, HE AND THE FOLKS AROUND BUSH WERE TRYING TO MAKE ME A KIND OF NORTHEAST LIBERAL WHO WAS OUT OF TOUCH AND THAT KIND OF A THING. I MEAN, THE IRONY OF THIS IS THAT... YOU KNOW, I'M THE GUY WHO IS THE SON OF GREEK IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME OVER HERE AND LIVED THE AMERICAN DREAM. NOTHING AGAINST YANKEE BRAHMANS WHO WERE HERE SINCE 1630. -A NICE WASP KID, BORN IN MILTON. -AND TEXANS WANT A TEXAN FOR PRESIDENT. -TEXANS WANT A TEXAN AS PRESIDENT, NOT SOMEONE FROM MASSACHUSETTS. -BORN IN MASSACHUSETTS. WE LIVED DOWN IN -- GREW UP IN CONNECTICUT. -BUSH COULD EAT PORK RINDS, BUT HE WAS A YALIE AND HE WAS AN ELITE. AND HE MAY HAVE LIVED IN TEXAS, BUT PEOPLE STILL THOUGHT OF HIM FROM CONNECTICUT. LEE WAS THE ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE COUNTRY. -DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU I'M NO TEXAN. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -LEE UNDERSTOOD THE POWER OF IMAGE AND HOW AMERICAN SYMBOLS RESONATE WITH A LOT OF SOUTHERNERS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND DEMOCRATS TO THIS DAY SCRATCH THEIR HEAD AND CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERESTS BY SUPPORTING THESE REPUBLICANS WHEN, IN FACT, THE AUDACITY AND ARROGANCE OF THAT IS PROUD PATRIOTISM TRANSCENDS MONEY. -SMILE. -MR. PRESIDENT! -THE QUESTION I REALLY WANT TO HEAR HIM ANSWER IS, WHY IN THE WORLD DID HE VETO THIS BILL CALLING FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO BE SAID IN OUR CLASSROOMS? CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? GET DOWN HERE, DUKAKIS, AND ANSWER THAT QUESTION! -KIDS SALUTE THE FLAG EVERY DAY. IT'S PART OF THE LAW. I'M ALL FOR IT. THE QUESTION WAS, COULD YOU PUT TEACHERS IN JAIL WHO REFUSED TO LEAD THE PLEDGE? SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT. -WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE? IT'S JUST SHOWING THAT YOU BELIEVE AND YOU STAND BEHIND YOUR COUNTRY. I DON'T THINK THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. -EVERY ONE OF US COULD STAND SOME MORE PATRIOTISM. -WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO MR. BUSH THAT I WASN'T GONNA LET HIM QUESTION MY PATRIOTISM. -I'M NOT QUESTIONING HIS PATRIOTISM. I'M QUESTIONING HIS JUDGMENT. -REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY STRIDENT, ALMOST, IN ATTACKING MIKE DUKAKIS. -NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S STRIDENT. I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT'S A MIS-ADJECTIVE. I WOULD SAY STRONG. -WHAT'S YOURS? -WELL, MINE IS ISSUE CLARIFICATION. -I DON'T LIKE THEM TAKING MY GUN. -WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I WASN'T TAKING PEOPLE'S GUNS AWAY IN TEXAS, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT'S SON, NOW THE PRESIDENT, RAN AROUND TEXAS TELLING THEM THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING. -IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY GUNS HERE, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE A COMMUNIST COUNTRY. -TEXAS REPUBLICANS DIDN'T WASTE A MINUTE. FIVE MILLION LETTERS TOLD TEXAS VOTERS THAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS NOTHING BUT A NORTHEAST LIBERAL, AND THAT'S A CUSS WORD FOR A LOT OF TEXANS. -A LIBERAL IS SOMEBODY WHO WANTS MORE GOVERNMENT, MORE TAXES, MORE SPENDING, MORE REGULATION, AND MORE INTERFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. AND THE ONLY THING THEY WANT LESS OF IS DEFENSE, AND THAT'S THE ONE THING WE WANT MORE OF. -IF YOU LET THE CAMPAIGN BE ABOUT BUSH, YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE LOST. THE CAMPAIGN HAD TO BE ABOUT THE VALUES YOU PROJECT ONTO DUKAKIS. IT WAS AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF THE CULTURE WAR. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TURNED INTO A STEALTH PARTY THAT ARGUES ON BEHALF OF THE COMMON MAN AND GIVES ALL THE BENEFITS TO THE WEALTHIEST 1/10 OF 1%. IT ARGUES ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN MORALITY POLICIES, ENGAGES IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRIVATE BEHAVIOR. HE USED TO DESCRIBE THOSE ANTI-ABORTION FORCES AS THE "EXTRA CHROMOSOME GROUP" AND THE ONES WHO HAD A HAND COMING OUT OF THEIR HEAD, OR A THIRD EYE, YOU KNOW. THOSE WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE MOST DEVOTED PEOPLE TO HIS CAUSE. -A LITTLE LOUDER! -ONE THING LEE TOLD ME, BY THE WAY, THOUGH, IS NEVER, EVER, ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED IN A FUNNY HAT. [ LAUGHS ] -I WAS THERE. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SHOW. -MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS OPPOSED TO VIRTUALLY EVERY DEFENSE SYSTEM WE DEVELOPED. -THE TANK AD WENT DOWN HIS VOTING RECORD. I REMEMBER THINKING, "NOW, WE'VE GOT TO CHECK EVERY ONE OF THESE POINTS."

SHE WAS RAPED TWICE. -IT WAS A SO-CALLED INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE AD WHERE THEY SIMPLY USED HORTON'S FACE. -ONE WAS WILLIE HORTON, WHO MURDERED A BOY IN A ROBBERY, STABBING HIM 19 TIMES. DESPITE A LIFE SENTENCE, HORTON RECEIVED 10 WEEKEND PASSES FROM PRISON. HORTON FLED, KIDNAPPED A YOUNG COUPLE, STABBING THE MAN AND REPEATEDLY RAPING HIS GIRLFRIEND. -THE CANDIDATE AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM DENY ANY RESPONSIBILITY.

HE LOCKED THE OFFICE DOOR, AND HE POPPED THE FAMOUS WILLIE HORTON SPOT ONTO A TELEVISION. HE SAID, "I GOT A COUPLE BOYS GOING TO PUT A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS UP FOR THIS INDEPENDENT."

THIS HAS BEEN THE HISTORICAL ROLE OF THE AMERICAN PRESS. THERE'S SOMETHING DEEP IN THE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS ATTRACTED TO FEAR. I KNOW I LIKE HORROR MOVIES. NOT ONLY POLITICIANS, BUT PEOPLE WHO RUN THE MEDIA, WILL EXPLOIT THIS. -FEAR IS AN ATTENTION GETTER, ANYTHING TO KEEP A STORY GOING. -TERRORISTS, THE HISPANICS, GAYS, COMMUNISTS. -I WAS AMAZED THAT THE DUKAKIS CAMP NEVER SEEMED TO FIND IT IN THEM TO FORCEFULLY EXPLAIN THAT THAT PROGRAM IN MASSACHUSETTS WAS COPIED AFTER A POPULAR STATE WHOSE GOVERNOR WAS THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO SIGN A LAW FOR WEEKEND PRISONER RELEASE.

HIS SON ADMITS THAT HE HAD AN ADDICTION PROBLEM WITH LIQUOR AND WITH DRUGS. THE BUSH DAUGHTERS. YET THESE ARE PEOPLE ALWAYS LECTURING AFRICAN-AMERICANS ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. -THESE FOLKS SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN PUT AWAY IN JAIL, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
