You are going to kill us. You know I would never kill you. Come on, animals. Speaking of vulgar.. Oh, my god, grow up! Jeez. I should've brought a condom. Your boyfriend. He's the one for me. I can't believe I just did my first audition. It was so exhilarating, but I think I have a lot to learn from you still, Heather. I think you just have to put yourself into the mindset of the character, and that's really all there is to it. Right, Ethan? Yes, Heather. You two are gonna be brilliant for this film. I'm really excited. I think everyone dreams of being a movie star when they grow up. I know. It is really exciting. You know I forgot that it's almost Halloween, oh, yeah. That's enough to play with your brain. It's scary. Um, yeah. Definitely. (Voices) He didn't even see me. I hope so. You should go take the binder and see if he took your picture. Hey. Are you going to stay in the shallow end? Go to the deep end. Play a game. Yeah. We're on scene right now. Oh, my god. Go play with yourself. I'll take care of it. Come on, team. No, no, no, no, no. Location scouting. We talked about this. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. Hey, hey! Don't touch the binder. It's off-limits. Okay. I was just curious. Sorry. Can you guys stop bickering for once? It's getting annoying. Oh, my god. I think I heard something. You always hear something. You hear something three times a week. No, I'm serious. I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear anything either. It's nothing. Can you please go check it out? Right now? Yeah. In my bathing suit. Yeah! Ethan, why don't you go check it out? You're not in a bathing suit. Gene, you're a tough guy. Why don't you go see.. Keep looking in your binder. You look busy. She hears noises three times a week. Gene? Be careful. Watch out for bears! Monsters everywhere. What am I looking for? There's nothing out here. I don't know. I heard a noise. Just do it, Gene? I don't know where else to look. There's nothing out here. There's absolutely nothing. I don't know how many times I'm gonna say that. Seriously, keep looking. I really think I heard something. Come look. You come look. You come out in the cold and look for the monster with me. Hey! Oh, my god! You're gonna get fucked up, Buddy. You're gonna get fucked up, Buddy! Hey! What are you doing here? Jacob, you fucker, Man! Holy, I almost fucking shit my pants. Remember when you told me to do something with my life? Well, this is it, Buddy. Oh, my god. I finally fucking got him, big tough Gene Daddy, eh? You're interrupting us. I'm interrupting. Look at this. He's genuinely scared. Isn't that what you wanted? I needed to talk to you. Where were you? Getting this film off the ground, Man. We have to be there by 2:00 tomorrow. All right, all right. Fuck! Gene! Oh, Gene! Oh! Fuck! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my god! Holy fuck. That was good. You were amazing. Holy fuck. Wow. Okay. Honestly, though, no more talk Why you don't fit in the horror movie. Anymore for the rest of the night. Okay? We're finished talking about it. What's wrong with wanting to be in a horror movie? Are you serious? How many horror movies have we watched, including a cabin and someone fucked up like Ethan? What happens in the cabin? Everyone dies at the end. No one's alive. Nobody. Not you, not me. He's fucked in the head. It's not real. It'll happen. Something will fucking happen. I'll get there my own way. I'll get there the hard way. I'm gonna bust out into the Indie scene, and I'm gonna take control of it, and it all starts with this movie. Sure, it might not be in five star theaters, win any Oscars, but I don't care about that. The fact of the matter is I'm creating. I'm doing what I want to do, and I'm going against what everybody ever told me, so screw them, you know. But thanks for picking me up, by the way. I really appreciate that. You don't care if I burn, do you? I didn't think so. You know, you haven't been saying much this whole time. Well, I'm used to doing all the talking anyway, so... I'm sure we can be pretty good friends, you know? Mm. Oh, this is some primo shit, too, you know? It's nice and wet. Oh, yeah. Smell that? Mm. You know, and under the circumstances, I'd say there'd be a dead skunk in the bush somewhere, but when you smell that, you know Milton's coming through. Oh, I'm gonna be flying by the time we get there. Might have to wear sunglasses for the whole take, you know what I mean? Wasn't that the turn off for Echo Lake Road back there? It was, wasn't it? Pull over. I said pull over. What are you doing? What, you're crazy. Let me out. You're gonna fucking kill us. You know, this isn't funny. I wouldn't have gotten In the fucking vehicle if I'd known you would pull this shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Fuck. Oh, shit. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Hey! You in some kind of trouble, Friend? No, Sir. We're just rehearsing a scene for a movie. We don't want any trouble here. Something not right about making movies in other people's property. You shouldn't be here! Listen to me. I said you shouldn't be here! You should be out! At school! Sir, we're just here for the night. Hey! I'm speaking. You two, who's the smart ass? It was you, wasn't it? We're just here for the night, Sir. Ah, did I say you could speak? You in charge? What the fuck's going on here? We're making a movie. A movie. This place isn't for you To come onto my property and film your sick, twisted fantasies. Catch you on my land again, that's gonna be your head. Move! That was weird, but I got what I wanted. Scene was pretty intense, sound levels are bang on, Guys. Yeah, except Milton's gonna need some more powder on his face. Yeah, I'm sweating like a pig from all that running. It's a lot hotter than I thought it was gonna be out here. Guys, these camera angles are looking good. Yeah, but ethan has all the close-ups, and he took off before we could have a look. He's so secretive. Like, rudely antisocial. He didn't even offer To drive us back. Typical. Well, he seemed pretty shaken up about that old guy. I think we should get back to the cottage. The guys and the rest of the cast and crew are gonna be there. Good idea. Let's pack it up. I think we got what we needed here. You all right, Man? Yeah. That was messed up, though. You just gotta love this footage. Yeah, except for Milton's shiny face. That is the last time I'm ever in the backseat. The last time. I always sit in the front seat. Yeah, exactly. Always. No more. It's done. Grab your stuff. I just want to get in there. Hey... Oh, my god, Gene. Ew, Gene! You're so vulgar! Come on, Jade. Fuck, you know you like it just as much as she does, and I know it. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. I'll come with Jacob. Oh, your boyfriend... Woo! Oh! Did you see what she's wearing? Such a slut! Oh, my god. Where are we? Hillbilly Deluxe. Come on. Come on. Two in my hand here. Footage looks good, Steven. Face is blown out, though. Thought that was you. Yeah. That's my bad. Sorry. The camera angles are good. I'll give you that. I knew you'd like those. Um, excuse me. I fucking got choked. Does anyone care? Not really. Old Milty almost lost his head, though. Yeah, that was messed up, for sure. That was psycho. Has anyone seen Jacob or Sheila? No... No, can you find them? Hello? I can sense someone's out here. Sheila. Ah! Man, you never let me have my fun. All right. Toke time. You packed it? Yup. Good to go. Do this. So good. Ethan, not again. We're not hurting anyone, Gene. Yeah, just your future there, Ethan. Just your future. I need a little inspiration. We all do right now. Hey, Ethan? Hey, everyone's pretty much ready to go. Uh, Milton's pretty stoned, though. I can go give him a boot. Do you want me to bring anything? Just your talent, Jade. Okay. Are you ready for tonight? Yeah. I mean, I'm trusting you On this one, so we'll see. You gonna be a star, remember? This is all about you. Can you put that in your pack for me? Yeah. Sure. Your character's gonna need it later. All right. We'll be ready in five? Five minutes. Okay. Steven, can you get an establishing shot of us, Till we drive out? Absolutely. And make sure Sheila and Jacob don't take too long. Okay. Eli, I think we'll get better sound down here. And cut! That's a wrap for crew for today. Pack it up. You're loving this assistant director thing way too much. Well, it's my job, isn't it? I mean, when he's not around, and, well, someone's gotta do it. Fuck! What's up? I gotta meet a guy down the road. He's donating food. I'll be back. How long is that gonna be? Uh, 20, latest 30 minutes. All right. When I get back, we can get out of here. Ethan, you can't get out and help push the boat? That's your job, Gene. Thank you, Gene. And the first one out, of course, obviously. Oh, god. Oh, god, oh, god. I hate boats. Aah! Okay. What are Sheila and Jacob doing in that canoe? Sheila and Jacob are tossing over a dummy, practicing for a scene because Jacob, he has an untimely swimming death in the film, right? So they're testing it out. Safety. I guess it is really cold. It is the end of October. I don't know. It just looks like there's only one of them in there. No, no. He's in there. No. It's just the dummy. Relax. Okay. So, why are all the people in the movie getting killed? We don't know that they're getting killed yet, Jade, Just that they're disappearing. You see, that's what makes a movie scary. The less the audience knows, the more suspenseful it is. Well, that's right. Yeah, it's true. So then, what's happening to them? We don't know yet. The ending hasn't been written. So it's about a murderer. No, a serial killer. Oh, my god. Listen to it. Creepy, isn't it? Let's start a fire. Milton, Gene. Yeah. We're on it. Heather, it would be my pleasure... Surprise. Mm-hmm. Three more minutes, Milton! Heather, don't you have one of these at home? Oh, my god. Come on. It's a joke. Honestly, Ethan, I'm not that impressed so far. It looks like my grandma's kitchen. Careful, Gene. Great. A death trap, Ethan. Detail... Oh, my god. Ah! What's the difference between a murderer and a serial killer? One kills for a specific reason, usually tied to a subject, and the other does it to satisfy something inside of him. Ethan, you're talking out of your ass. Every single shock movie, anything you've ever seen is all the same. Gene, I'm not shitting you. This film has a unique blend to it. It's going to put the recycled garbage from the past 20 years to shame, and if we do this film right, all of our lives will change. It's the character. You guys are the important piece of this puzzle. You get it? Look around. See the woods? This is where our story takes place. Do you have something? Come on, Jen. I told you I'm not wearing those anymore. Well, then nothing! Come on. I hate them. You know that! No! I'm gonna take a piss then. This thing's not over. Dan? Dan? Dan? Dan? Yes! Oh, that was great. Honestly, 90%. Give me 10 more? Yeah. Good. Hey, Guys. Can we block on my death scene? I think you're gonna like it. Yes, we can, Milton. In a minute! Can we finish this first? I guess. The waterfalls are your stage to shine, okay? You get that? We'll get there. Yeah, it's fine. Okay? Relax. Yeah, Milton. It's gonna be really fun to watch you die. That was a little harsh, Jade. What was that for? I mean, I'm just kidding. It's not gonna happen, so it doesn't matter. How do you know that? I don't know. But you like this stuff, Heather. I hate it. You're gonna be a good addition to this movie. Hey, what's the deal with that camera chick? She's bi, eh? Oh, my god. You know, Gene, I'd tell you to think before you say something, but I can't. This is brilliant. Keep doing it. Is she actually bi? I don't think so. Now Milton, you wanted your moment. This is it. Jade, this is you two, okay? Okay. Crucial scene for your character. Remember that. Something's gonna happen to your character. React to that. Milton! Cut down that scream. I heard you working on it a little earlier. A little too much. Really? Yeah? Yeah. You do. Can you go take your mark over there, please? Huh, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Joke. Um, so, when he goes missing, I should go look for him, right? You could do that, or you could go down over in that area and investigate a strange noise, or something? Okay. Whatever you feel. Hey, Milton. You ready? Yeah. Jade, take your position. Stand by. Action! H-hello? What are you doing over there? Is this some kind of joke? Mitch! Mitchell! Come out! You're scaring me! Cut! Jesus, Milton. What? I told you about that scream! Didn't you hear me earlier? Let me guess. I over did it. Yeah, as you always do. Whatever. Fuck, we gotta move. We're losing light, actually. So we're done, just like that? Jade, you were good, actually. 50% to where you need to be. And Milton... I wasn't good enough, was I? What did you just say to me? I was freezing. Look at her. Yeah. Like, honestly, Man, I think you've seen one too many horror movies. Your mind is warped. Fuck! Gene, why are you pulling this shit right now? I wrote a fucking script, okay? This is a movie! It's part of the process. Part of the process. Wait, you Guys. Guys, what's going on? Nothing, Jade. I lost my focus. I won't again. Oh, my god. Who is that? That's the man we saw earlier. He told us to stay off of his property. Yeah, I think we've got to move. Milton! I need you to go down to the beach and pick up the canoe with Jacob. I thought we were all going back to the cabin together. Yeah, we are, but I need you to go down to the beach! Can you do that for me? By myself? Yes! Go pick up your bag! Now! It's getting dark! I don't give a fucking rat's ass if it's dark. I'm afraid of the dark, though. Oh, you're afraid of the dark. Go! I came here to act in a movie, not to be your little errand boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking films. I'm bigger than that anyways. It's a joke, a freaking joke. Freaking joke. Maybe I will just move to Hollywood and join the union after all. What the fuck was that? Hello? I know someone's there. Like, come on, Guys. Really? I haven't had a good enough day, as it is. I don't need this shit right now. All right. I suck, Guys. All right, I suck! That's what you want to hear? Yeah, I suck. Ridiculous. I'm sick of it. What the fuck is this? Oh. That's really weird. Whoa! Jesus Christ. "Go to Hell." You know, I always knew he was a nut job. This is getting to be a bit much, though. What the hell is all this for? Chains... Look at the stuff in here. What the hell's all this for? Help. Help. J-Jacob? Help. Help me. J-Jacob? Jacob? They all know why you sent me to go with you, right? 'Cause it's doofus waking up. When you're not good, Gene, you're not good. Sorry. Oh, my god. It's almost right here. What the hell? Who is that? It's so creepy. Hey. Oh, my god. Hey! What are you doing here? I said we were going to be filming... Get the fuck off the road! Filming, are you? Punk! Filming. You don't scare me. I don't need to scare you, Bitch. Don't! You know what tonight is? Huh? Do you know what tonight is? Ah, I know what it is. Who is this guy? This guy's crazy. Ah. Tonight... Is the night she awakens. She? Who's he talking about? He doesn't know anything. He's nuts. Let's go. Read the papers, right? Yeah, I read the papers.. Good! Then you should know that on every All Hallow's Eve, in these woods, people go missing. Dangerous. Hey. We're done here. Come on. Let's go. We've got one more location, and we're out of here. Yeah, one more location, and you're not fucking done, are you? No. I have more work to do. Go do your work, Boy. Go. Go! Goooo! Ethan, walk away. The guy's crazy. Let's go! Fucking fuck with me. Fucking get out of here! Come on! Ethan! It's too late. Too late! Too late! Where the fuck... Filming, eh? How about this, Bitches? Lights! Camera! Action! It's too late! Too late! I just can't get that guy out of my head. It was so freaky. Oh, he's just a local lunatic. Crazy. Is this it? This is where we're filming, Ethan? Huge location right here. Let's do some scene rehearsal. Who wants to go in first? Oh, I'm not going in there alone. You want to go in, don't you, Gene? Fuck, no. I'm not going in there. Jade, this is a perfect opportunity for you to work on your character. No, no.. No, no, I'm insisting. I don't want to go in.. Actually, it might be a good idea. It will give you some inspiration. Do I really have to go in here? Oh, my god. I mean, it's.. It's locked. Ugh. My god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Jade! Relax. There's something in there! Relax. No, no, there's something in there! Jade, Jade. Relax! It's just you in there, Jade. It's just Jacob. What? Holy fuck, you are a dick, Ethan. Let's go in and see him. Oh, why would you do that to her? We're getting ready for our next scene. People look at us like you're crazy. No, they were looking at you like you were crazy. You were holding onto my neck instead of my shoulder. Well, if you knew how to drive, then I wouldn't have the problem of hanging on. Or maybe if you weren't choking me, I could drive. Okay, whatever. I'm gonna go take a piss. I'm not in any of the scenes anyway, as long as I stick around. Why do we have a four wheeler? You should get over it and learn how to drive. Are you smoking? Seriously? I told you I smoke. I thought you accepted that. That's disgusting. Well.. Just give me your phone. I've got to call my dad. Holy shit. This fire is so hot, I've got to take a couple of steps back here. Hot, like Kristine? It's Kristen. Really? Like it matters? Why are you sending her little smiley faces? Yeah, you did. You slept.. I didn't sleep with her. We dated, like, a couple of years ago. Are you kidding? Are you serious? She's not even wearing anything! It's that girl from the four wheeler this morning. What was that? I don't know. You heard that, too? Oh. No. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Did you hear that? They're coming now. They're coming. What are you guys doing? Hey. How's it going? Hi. Gene. I'm an actor, actually. Are you? Yeah. How's it going? We're actually looking for a couple new characters. Gene! Are you? Gene! We're rehearsing over here! Ethan, we need a part for her. No, we have to. Can I die? Who are you? What's your name? I'm Kaitlyn, and Cody. Yes. You can die, actually. That's so cool! Mitch? Dan? Mitch? Hello, where are you guys? Mitch? Dan? Hello? Uh... Um... Hello? Hello, where are you? Are you in here? Hello? Hello? Oh, you have to help me, please. There's dead bodies. They're everywhere. There now, My Dear. Fucking slow down. I can't understand you if you don't slow down. Slow down? No, no. You're not hearing what I said. You'll be all right. I'll take care of you. What about my friends? It's just the woods in the nighttime. That's why you're all upset. No, no, no. Ooh! Oh, fuck. This is such... One moment, Child. Oh, my. So young. And pretty. Who could've done this? Mitch? Mitch, what happened? We have to go to the police. No, no, no. The killer's is still out there. Don't worry. I'll go with you. Oh, I have such terrible memories of this place. It should've been torn down years ago. They had so much trouble here. The man in the woods. Oh, fuck. "Go to Hell." Fuck you, too. Do you know a woman was murdered here 20 years past? An accident, or so they claim. It was a sick, twisted plot for a film. The wife wasn't keen enough... Jade, listen to the killer's voice. You're safe. Kill her. Kill her... (Whispers) No. Stop, stop! Please, stop! Stop! Leave me! Stop! Hello? Jacob? Jacob? Jacob, stop fucking around! Tina. Oh, my god. Oh, god. Please. Please stop. Tina. Tina. Ah! No. No. No, no. No, don't. No. No! No, no. Oh, why are you doing this? Good. It was intense, but we have to talk About this later. I have to go pee really quick. Uh, you can't go in there. You have to use the outhouse, remember? Yeah, okay. Don't mess with her. It's like this again, eh? Yes. Same fucking thing with Sarah, right? Go down to the beach and pick up the canoe. It's not going to happen like this anymore. I'm not gonna let you run this sick, fucking game. Fuck you.

Hope he can find a shirt. Gene, Heather, me and Jade Have one additional scene to work on with jacob, who's still inside. Are you cool with heading back to the cabin? 'Cause it's just 10 minutes down the way. Yeah. Yeah, I thought we actually came in this way, though. You did, Gene, but if you head down that way, it's actually quicker. You're done for the night. It's over. Relax. Ethan, before I go, can I try the mask? No, Jacob's got it on. He won't let you touch it. I just want to try it on once. It's creepy. There are some props I don't want to play with. Don't be scared, Heather. He won't hurt you out there. Are you guys staying here, or are you guys coming back to the cabin? Yeah, I have time. 20 minutes? 20 minutes. Yeah. We'll be waiting. Do not forget to put that fire out, Ethan. Oh, I won't, Gene. I had a blast today. Yeah, all the guys had a freaking time. You promised me a 3-way for my birthday with Jade, which I've still yet to see. What is that? Did you hear that? Oh, my god. It's a four wheeler. Let's go. No, you have everything in my pack. Shit, I have to go back to the cabin. No, you can't just leave me out here. Yes, I can. It's just up the way, 5 minutes. Go! No. Yeah. No. Are you serious? Oh, my god. I might as well just take a shit, then. No, not in there. Ethan said to use the outhouse, and I want to take a shower. You know how cold the fucking seat's gonna be in the outhouse right now? It's minus 30 out there. Uh, you can come join me and warm up when you're done. You promise? Yes. Keys, please. Better not break that promise. Ah! Ah! Oh, my god. Ethan! What are you doing here, Jade? Well, I heard the four wheeler, and it was too far from the cottage, so I just came back to find you. Relax, Jade. It's just what you make of it. Can I see your pack? Yeah, yeah, whatever. It's your fault That I'm so scared, though. It's all in your head, Jade. Walk with me, will you? It's all about the title. What is the title? All the cliché dates are taken, Jade, but not this one. Oh? And I was thinking... "October 30th." What do you think? I mean, it's good. It's really good. (Mumbling) Nice try, Ethan. Nice try. Every story I researched had someone flirting with the idea Of committing a crime. I honestly believe if you choose to do something that inhumane, you aren't really human after all. I don't know, Ethan. I don't know Where you get your drive from for this stuff. It's like nothing can stop you. Jade, the moment you think nothing can stop you is the moment the unexpected happens. Weird. Hmm. (Voices) Hmm? How long does it take to shit? Gene? This is totally killing the mood. Gene? There's lots of other things we could be doing right now! This isn't one of them. This isn't funny. Oh, Gene. It's not funny! Better not be in there. Gene, if you're out there, come out now. It's not funny! Gene! Gene! Oh, my god. Gene! Where are you? This isn't funny! In screenwriting, the story is always bigger than you are. I'm still waiting for it to manifest, but.. Did you hear something, Jade? Yeah, I think so. I think maybe if he has an attitude adjustment, then yes, I think Jacob could play the killer. Gene, My Boy. What the hell? What, what is that? Is that Heather? Gene? Hey, Heather, Gene? Where are you guys going? You said you wanted to have a drink! Jade, you coming? They'll be back. Well, yeah, but she promised we were gonna have a drink, and I'm really.. Don't worry about it. There's one more thing I need to do, though, I need to light a fire for Jacob. Okay. Wait. I need your backpack. Why? Matches. Okay, here. Um, I'm gonna go change. I'll meet you down there, Jade. Done a wardrobe change, Jade. Kinda like that. Shut up. It's just my comfy clothes. I wasn't bugging you. I said that I liked it. What do you think of the fire? Hey, Ethan. I really wanted to ask you.. Do you get along with your brother? Why would you ask that question? I don't know. I'm just curious, I guess. He's nothing like me, though. We're very different. He's way too conservative. What do you mean conservative? Well, he has difficulty deciding what he wants to do, so sometimes he doesn't do anything at all. He likes structure. Chaos just stresses him out. You always answer more than just my question. I try to educate, Jade. Hey, did you know that the term educate was actually derived from the Latin word educe, meaning to draw from within? I didn't know that. I'm going for a glass of wine. Would you like anything? Um, yeah. Beer? Consider it done. Oh, my god. Ethan? Ethan? Ethan? Oh, my god. Jesus Christ, Jade. I was waiting for you. Why is it so dark in here? It's a good question, Jade. It's dark in here because all my greatest ideas come to me at night. Oh, my god, Ethan. What could you possibly be writing right now? The new scene, Jade. A new scene? Ethan, you're seriously nuts. What else is there, Jade, Besides doing what you love? Family, relationships, romance? Romance? Romance and me, they don't work. I don't understand that. I mean, you're a good-looking guy, and you're talented, and you're exciting. I bet girls would love to have you as a boyfriend. That's fine. I'll accept your flattery, but I'm going to stress one point. I'm not interested. What if I don't believe you? I don't expect you to believe me. In fact, I don't think there's many people who do understand what is going on in my mind. So, educate me. You know, Jade, I prefer not to go there, but I will tell you, I do think about what you suggested. You know, you can still create art and write, and have relationships. Agreed, but if I did that, that person would become a distraction, want to know what I'm up to, where I'm gonna be. "Why don't you spend more time with me?" There's just no time for that, Jade. But what if you met that perfect someone, and she understood your need for privacy? Then would you date them? No. It disrupts my future plans. What if you were an actor, and the scene you were in called for you to fall in love with the other character? Would you? If that's what the role called for, then that's what I would display. So you won't fall in love in real life, but you'll fall in love for a movie. That doesn't really make any sense. Stop trying to put the pieces of my puzzle together, Jade. Read this. Tell me what you think of it. Hmm. Well, it does make a good midpoint in the movie. Who's gonna play the male opposite me? Jade, do you want to block it out? We can bring the camera this time and see how your angles are. But we just got back here. Okay, just seeing if you want to work on it. It's up to you... If you wanted to. Well, why don't we block it out in here? I don't think that's a good idea. It's been written for gene. I don't think so. You're doing it. All of the classics, they have their scares, but I just think that we're missing a bit of the chemistry. Not bad, if I do say so myself. I always give 110%, Jade. I noticed. I think I finally figured out how to get to you, Ethan. Yes, you did. Now can we go to the cabin? If you answer one more question for me. What is that, Jade? Why did you write this scene? Was it just your way of telling me you were interested, without actually telling me? I wrote this scene based on what you displayed today, which is exactly what I thought you would display when I cast you for this role. No, I don't think you did. I think you set this whole night up, just to have this moment with me. Well, if that's what you think, then I'll admit there's some slight truth to that. You just set me up. Yes. So, everything you said before, it was just a move? You were just hitting on me, just so you could get me into bed? Ethan, you completely contradicted everything you said. Jade, if it was my intention to seduce you, I would've done that; but it wasn't. My intention was to put you in an atmosphere similar to your character, so that you would grasp the story, the role, not for foreplay. Jacob, Sheila, Heather, Milton, Gene, even the old man, they're all in on this. But wait. Jade, before you can panic, I promise you that tonight's lesson will prove far more valuable than anything you'll find in this town or anywhere. That doesn't explain why Gene and Heather left. Yes, it does, Jade. They're in position at the main cabin, like I told you! In position? For what? Oh, my god. Ethan, I can't handle this. They're in position to film the second half of the scene I claim to have just wrote but actually wrote months ago. Okay. Whatever. The director knows best, right? So, I guess if I'm not done work for the night, we'd better leave, so where are the keys? I'll drive. Ha, ha, ha. No. I'll drive. Do you really think I'm ready? I mean, it's next week. Yeah, I do, Jade. I really do think you're ready. I can't believe Heather didn't tell me. She's never been able to keep anything from me. No, she didn't tell you because I told her not to. I wanted her to keep her lips sealed. So, you told everyone to be here in this specific cabin, for this specific moment? Yes, I did. Creepy, isn't it? Yeah. Fuck. It's going to rain. Ah, wait. I have one final thing To ask of you, Jade. I need you to stay in the zone. I need you to not break focus when you're in character. Can you accept that challenge? Yeah. Can we just take a two minute break and just come back to reality, please? Yes, we can, in ten minutes. That's all I need from you, ten minutes. Okay, fine. Whatever. What do I need to know? You don't need to know anything. All I need you to do is become your character. Are you ready? Um, yeah, I think so. I'll just feel it out and see what happens. The stage is set, Jade. This is your time to shine. Three, two, one. Action. Take a look around, Jade. The atmosphere. The perfect atmosphere. Have a seat. Remember the scene I wrote earlier? Yeah? The second half is what we're gonna do right now. The dialogue is very simple. Your performance earlier tonight wasn't good enough. I need more fear. Get it? Yes. Okay. Let's settle in. Three, two, one. Action. Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina. Tina. Stop, please. Hey! Stop. Cut! Stop, please? Jade, we're not trying to reinvent the '80s here. Wake up! I'm trying! One more time. From the top. Three, two, one. Action. Hi! I like you. You are very pretty. Really... Hey! I'm talking to you. Ha! Stop. Cut! Jade, this man... This man... Is a schizophrenic psychopath. He will do bad things to you. I'm trying. More! From the top! I'm going to give you a different villain this time because obviously the first two didn't get to you. Let's settle in. Three, two, one. Action. Mm, mm, mm. Sounds like someone's got herself... In trouble over here. Oh. Hey! Don't. Good. Good! Good. I like it, Jade! Now you're acting! I have a question for you. If were paying attention earlier, you should be able to answer this. What clue is it that the killer gives to Tina that reveals the ending? What is it? Think. Hero vs. Villain. What is going on in her mind? Um, that he's crazy? No! Think harder. I don't.. I don't know. Think! I don't know, Ethan. He gives something away, says the wrong name. Yes! Something in that brain after all, Jade. I think you're ready for act two. Lights up. Have you ever heard of a rib separator? Huh? Hey! Listen, so you take this fine weapon. Place it there. You could do some real damage. Hold that. Hey! Relax. Now, Tina, one of my personal favorites is the hook. You want to be very contemptive with that. Perfect. Don't move. Now... This is not a toy, Tina. Now this toy here, Sir, is a little more classic. You see... You take that, and you give a little cut. A lot you could do up there. Hey. One of my personal favorite things is... Something you haven't seen before. Something the world hasn't seen before. This. Have you ever seen one of these, Jade? It's an old fucking hockey mask. Tina... A chainsaw. And now... It's almost time. Yes, Jade. This is it, Your final test. When you hear action, they'll be waiting. Sit! Don't move. Welcome to the final act, Jade, act three, the resolution of our story. I knew the moment I saw you you were something special, and I remember why you're a star. Why? 'Cause you're so fucking stupid. Oh, Jade, Jade. This night is about so much to learn. Hey! This is my warning, Jade. You're just a part of it. I don't understand. Do you know tarot cards? Do you know what they do? Do you know what they symbolize? Past, present and future. Not many people really do know what the cards say. Jade, ever seen this one? There's one particular card that you just don't want to see. Heather, I don't understand. Hey! What did you just say? Shh. Jade, take a look in the mirror. You wanted the fame, didn't you? You wanted to be the star? You are. You are my star. It's just about time. All good things come to an end, Jade. In the name of the father... The son... And The Lady In White. Who are you? Who are you? Who am I? Who am I? No one. No one. Wrath.
