Ka-hsi Ka-hsi coming why are you taking so long to get the rice? - I am coming now! - Hurry up. Brother, ka-hsi is really nice. She didn't give me away and she hid me. She also gave you food. Yes, she's nice. She told me not to steal anymore. If I'm hungry, I'm to wait here for her she'll bring the food to us. Look, ka-hsi's coming. Let's have our lunch now. Let's say grace. Thank you, lord thank you, lord for your food. For your food. We pray thee we pray thee give us strength. Give us strength. Amen! Amen! I can't bring you food any more. I'm going to Hong Kong tomorrow. Why? I've been adopted. This is the last time. I can bring you food. Ka-hsi little tien ka-hsi remember not to steal any more! I'll remember. Boss, give me a big prawn, please. Here you are. Your big prawn, kid 20 cents, please. That's yours. What about you? I don't want to get spots. What about the spots? I care more about being wasteful. You're right. It's the bastard who stole my bread. Run! Hold it. Got you. Try and get away now. Brother... What a thug! You're creating a scene. You haven't paid up. This is to remind you of that. Here is your money, Mr. Hong. What about you two? Here you are. I'm sorry. Don't forget again. We won't. We won't get bullied if we're like them. Put it there. Come on, quick. Thank you. Look here! Smile... Hold on. You little beauty, come over here. Ready? Richard, the boss's calling you. Hang on. I'm sorry. Where's the boss? It's the time, mr lui. Get lost. Are you ready? Ready. Ladies and gentlemen. This is our club's opening night. It's also our boss Alan's birthday. Many happy returns. Thank you. Ah tien, our other boss who's also Alan's brother is to dedicate a song to Alan. What are you up to this time? Wishing him a very happy birthday. Many happy returns. Happy birthday. This is naughty of you. Cheers. Ok Your brother's got a soft spot for you. You've got a soft spot for us too and made an exception to come here. I'm just here for a drink. Just a drink? Ah lui, call all the girls over here. We'll see if he can resist the temptation. Mind yourself, uncle man. It was my sixtieth birthday a while ago. I had my last battle with my wife then. You're welcome. It's now a new world for the younger generation. Us old folks should stand aside for you. You're being modest, uncle man. Alan, ah tien, congratulations. Will you take care of uncle man? Let's go over there. Mr. chui, we're privileged. I like to be where the action is. Alan, I'd like to have a word with you. Go and find a beautiful girl for me. Yes. Come over here, then. - Take a seat. - Thank you. I've come to tell you about a possible fortune. My boss's got a lucrative job for you. Very kind of you. But I'm not sure if I could take it on. Don't be modest. The two of you have been doing so well in Macau taking charge of taipa and coloane with kao's acquiescence. Our takings are just too small for a big shot like him. No, it isn't true. Kao thinks highly of you both. He's very easy-going. He's happy to share the takings with everyone. We've got a consignment of crack to distribute through your outlets. You don't have to do a thing. You just sit there and take a share of the profits. Thank kao for me. But I've got my own way of doing things. I run gambling dens, nightclubs. I even run brothels. Plenty of men want sex and money but drugs I never touch. You won't do kao a favour then? That depends on how you look at it. Tonight isn't the night for business. Let's have some fun with the girls. Why not? Make yourself at home. Mr law from the police is here. Really? Get me two red packets. Excuse me. Make yourself at home. I will. Ten mr law, welcome to our club. Ah tien! Congratulations. Here it is, for the good luck. - You shouldn't really... - You're welcome. Let me introduce you to my new boss. This is ah tien. My new boss, superintendent chen. He just arrived from the uk. Nice to meet you. We're honoured. Congratulations. Business looks good. It's all right. We're privileged to be under your auspices. For good luck. What's all this about? I could arrest you for bribing police officer and obstructing justice. You've got to watch your step in my patch. Money doesn't talk here. Mark my words. Understood? What's happening? Mr law, your boss really knows how to pull your leg. Using handcuffs to cement our relationship. Let's all swear to work together. This is a memorable occasion. Let's take a picture together. Take a photo! Come on. Cheese! Is that a joke? Come on, smile. Let's go the whole hog. Hold your hands high and smile. You might as well take it as a joke but it isn't. Watch your step or I'll give you a hard time. He's so funny! Come on, more pictures. This isn't right on their opening night. You should show some respect. Thank you. I look forward to a happy working relationship. Thank you very much. What do you mean, respect? I won't show kao any respect either if I find evidence against him. Do come again. He's keen. He's just an old nag. Come on. Let's go. Take care, mr chui. Thank you. Sorry I can't take you right to the door. You can stop bragging. I know you've got a date. Have a good time. Bye. My boss wants to talk to you. What's your boss? You'll find out when you see him. Come on you son of a bitch! Go to hell! Take me to your boss? I'm terribly sorry. Oh no, you're bleeding. What a terrible misunderstanding. Hey, you, come over here. Look at your handiwork when you parked the car for me last night. It wasn't us. You've got it wrong. No, it was you. I didn't park your car. I was here last night, pissed. What's the problem, mate? You must be drunk. Piss off. Do you want your car in one piece? Get lost! I said piss off. Move! What do you want? Do you want to end up in hospital? Sorry, sorry. What a nutter. What's up? Some guy saying we damaged his car forget it. Let's call it a night He won't turn up, will he? You idiot! You want to mourn your father's death, do you? Boss, he's arrived. Alan, I wasn't too happy on your club's opening night. I didn't enjoy your hospitality. What do you expect from being our guest tonight? I expect to take things easy. Just call the shots and I'll be at your disposal. Me call the shots? I want to teach you a lesson. Don't be an asshole and stand in our way. I was going to let you in on our money. Not only are you ungrateful but you get in my way. Your brother won't live if you stand in our way. No one's going to come out the winner so don't you dare! Bring my brother here. Let's see if he's ok. Then you'll have your way. Don't worry. I'm taking good care of him. He's a bit roughed up but he's still in one piece. That's fine. Let's make a deal. You're making a mistake. I'm not prepared to negotiate with you. I'm going to dictate terms. You're going to do what I tell you. When I get the money, you get your brother back. Any objections? Look at the mess you're in. You should've been smarter. Brother, I did try hard to be smart. You son of a bitch! Hold it! - Drop it! - Move away! What's next, boss? Let them go. You look a lot smarter now. Don't tease me, please. What do you reckon? We've poked a stick in kao's eye. Don't worry. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Kao. You're late. - Kao. - Kao. Have I ever been on time? Please take a seat. There's no doubt that Alan shouldn't have killed mr chui but then mr chui should not have kidnapped ah tien. He was headstrong but he made money for me. He said he was working for me. Those who harmed him bore no respect for me. You've gone gaga, haven't you? What do you think you are? How dare you try to be a go-between? Don't interfere just because you were once my mentor. Whoever contradicts me digs their own grave. Nobody in Macau dares to disrespect me. Nobody dares touch my men. Do you? No, we don't! You must be kidding, kao. Everyone knows working for you means money for life. Everyone knows they must have respect for you. Who do you bastards think you are, killing my brother? Don't talk to my brother like that! Hold it! Don't point your finger at us! It's me who killed your brother. If you were to avenge his death feel free to have a go at me. But let me warn you you'd better get two coffins ready. One for me and the other for you. If I were to die today, you wouldn't have a single day's peace. You're threatening me, aren't you? In front of so many elders? You think I wouldn't shoot you? - Hold it there! - Hold it! I'm going to let you off this time since you've got the guts to match your words. If you touch my men again, I'll blow your head off. Everything's all right now. Let's sit down and have a cup of tea. Kao, you're a generous man. Have a drink. You're brave men. Let's have a toast. But I'm not sure just how brave. I've got a job in hand. Will you be interested? Kao, your line of business isn't our cup of tea. I'm not asking you to sell heroin. It's ammunition. I've got a contact in Thailand and the stakes are high. It's risky but as we all know, no pain, no gain. If you take this on we'll split the take 70/30. What do you think? Not small fry at all. Hang on. We aren't able to take it on ourselves. I'm giving you this as a favour and to see just how far you'll go. If we can't make money out of this, we might as well give up. Ok. We'll do it. We wouldn't be able to find uncle pui without you showing us the way. He's hard to find because everybody has scores to settle with him. Uncle pui, is this the thai way of doing business? Doing business? Kao asked you to come and do business with me? It's either you being stupid or he's exacting revenge on you. His man took my share and he killed my brother-in-law. My sister's still in mourning. Uncle pui, I've no idea what the score is between you two I only making money with him. He got me involved in this. If you had the guts, you would've hired someone to shoot him in Macau. It's important to deal fairly with enemies and friends in our trade. You can't scare me off. You're not scared of death? I'm scared of dying senselessly, of dying without honour. When I joined this trade, I put my life on the line. There's still a bullet in the barrel! If you think you'd be getting at kao, then by all means. I'd just take it as if I were killed in an accident. Don't move! There's still a bullet in the barrel! You wouldn't get away even if you shoot me. No, but I'd have a fairer deal. If you think you'd be getting at kao, then by all means. You're smart! Brilliant! You're the first one who talks to me this way. I like it! Please sit down. - Sit down. - Thanks. I never like bargaining. But I liked you as soon as we met, so I'll give you a special price. What would you like? I want to see the samples. Good! How many? About 200. 200? That's not enough. You need at least a few thousand! What for? I'm not launching a coup. Excuse me. Watch out! Quick! Quick, hurry up! This way! You've got guts. I owe you one. - Let's celebrate our friendship. - Why not! Wow! She's stunning. Ask her to come here right after this song, to that table. Please sit. What are your names? We should celebrate tonight. The girls here are gorgeous. Uncle pui, this is Jenny from Macau. It's an honour to finally meet you. You should've told me that you were in Thailand. Drink up! We'll all have doubles. Drink up! I know I deserve to be punished for not paying my respects. I'll drink to show my respect. Down in one! Great! Look, I've drunk it all. I like a woman who can drink! Where are you staying? In a hotel. Then come and stay with me. Thanks but I'm leaving. I'm flying to Singapore tomorrow morning. Don't go! You have to stay with me tonight! I'll pay double the amount you get paid. No, I can't. The show's been advertised already. What about next time? Don't scare her. Sit down. Come and stay with me tonight. Which girl do you fancy? Just tell me. You've already picked the girl I fancy. You fancy her as well. Why didn't you tell me? You can have her first. Make sure you behave yourself tonight. Take a seat. I have to use the bathroom. Shower or not, you stink anyway. You'd better be quick. I'll just have to accept it as bad luck. You're really dumb. I'm using the bathroom not for a shower but to take a dump. I don't want to do you but to rescue you. We're both from Macau and I can have any woman whenever I want. Don't forget this is Thailand. Piss off! It's you who's asked me to leave. I won't thank you for this. Hey, where are you going? See you soon. Ok. - What's that? - It's me. - Alan, have fun. - I will. I knew I wasn't going to get away tonight. Well, he isn't that bad. Oh, what the hell. Why are you lying in bed? You want me to crouch in bed then? Honestly, I didn't expect you'd be here. Hey, what do you mean, you didn't expect me to be here? I couldn't care less. You, Superman! It isn't a woman. What do you mean by that? You can either join our party, or you can just sit there and watch how I do it. You're not getting up so you must be joining us. Here I come. Well, it won't hurt to watch. Bravo! You're doing well, Superman! You enjoy watching us, don't you? I thought you were a hero in bed but you aren't. - Is that Alan? - Uncle pui? How is it? Is the girl good? Yes, very good. Horny? Yes, she is. Uncle pui wants to hear how horny you are. What do you mean? No, I'm not faking it. No? Then I won't be responsible for any consequences. Hello, why is it all quiet? You sound as if you're throwing up. Act better! That's it. Keep up the good work. Bye for now! What do you want? What do you want me to want? You said you didn't expect me to be here. That may be the case but you do expect me to... I was indeed expecting you to... but now... Go to hell! Does ming go to this school? You know anyone here? Liar! This used to be a convent. The office is over there. You go ahead! Aren't you going with me? Please go with me. If you can't even face a teacher, how do you face the world? I can't make a mess of it. You aren't good at preaching but how about playing rough? Rough? Who is ming's class mistress? Come here and speak to me! She's downstairs in the study room. Take me to see her! Ming, do you know why you have to stay after school? I know. What you have done is indeed wrong. I understand, miss ho. Good boy. Would you like some cake? Thank you, miss ho! Don't thank me, you should thank god. What should you do before eating? Say grace. - Shall we pray together? - Yes. - Thank you lord, - Thank you lord, - for your food. - For your food. - We pray thee. - We pray thee - give us strength, - Give us strength, - amen. - Amen. Ka-hsi! Ka-hsi! Ka-hsi! What's the matter, Lucia? Good grief, ka-hsi! A vicious man has come for you. - A vicious man? - Here he is! Oh, no! Richard, come here! Be careful of what you say to her. I know, be tough... I don't mean that... I am ming's class mistress. Who are his parent? We both are. I'm his real dad, he's his godfather like an acting father. - Shall we go in and talk? - Yes. There isn't anything to talk about. I always mean what I say. If you expel my son, I'll... hang on. I am a very seasoned... stop it. You've come to see the teacher. How can you be so rude to her? You told me to... I admit, I'm a peasant, a peasant. But here, we've got to respect a person who does a sacred job. No problem. A parent cares because he loves his child. If you really care, you should calm down and listen. You should ask what he's done. That's right. He's just a kid, how bad could he be? What's he done? He's trying to buy the girls. Buy them? He says he wants to buy a ride. Haven't I told you not to take ming to nightclubs? Don't you understand? Education at home is as important as in school. He always says his kid can't turn out bad. It's too late to reform a damaged child at school, isn't it? As parents, we should lead him to the right path before he goes astray. That's right, isn't it? Yes, well said. Thank you. Don't you have anything to say? That just shows how badly behaved you are. From now on, no more women staying overnight at home. Let me talk to her and you'll take ming home first. Move it! How dare you flirt with the girls? - Daddy! - Stop it. You little rascal. Look at youl! Would you like to have a cup of coffee with me? No, I have to go to taipa. I can give you a lift. - All right! - This way please. Have you been working here long? I used to teach in Hong Kong. I only returned here this term. Returned here? I used to live here. - Oh, did you really? - Yes, I did. Nothing much has changed. That stall, where I used to buy sesame balls, is still here. Do you want some now? Yes, please. Uncle bull, make us a few sesame balls. Mr. tien? What a coincidence... Call me ah tien, don't be so formal. What's wrong? Your name is tien? I had a childhood friend called tien. Did you? What a coincidence! Thank you. Bye, uncle bull. Thank you. How is he now? I don't know. I haven't seen him for years. I wouldn't recognise him even if we met again. That's so true. I wonder how he is now. What do you think he's doing? Nothing illegal, I hope. What if he is? That would be a shame. You're right. A good job that I'm not your pal tien or it'd be embarrassing. Are you married? Why do you ask? I just want to see if I'm going to get two more red packets this year. No, I'm not married. Neither am I. Our school's holding a fund-raising fair. Would you be able to donate some toys to us? Yes, of course. There's a few boxes of returned toys. They're cluttering up the place. You can have them if you like. Mr wong! Mr wong, I wonder if you've any others. It's going to be a fair. Those toys will be difficult to sell. They're free. But you're complaining that they aren't good enough. You've come to ask for a donation. Nicely put, I'm being charitable. Bluntly put, I'm chucking rubbish away. It's up to you. Sorry to have bothered you. You are welcome. Let's try somewhere else. They make some nice things. They aren't giving us any donation. Maybe not today. But you never know what might happen tomorrow. Come on, let's go. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. I've delivered the toys, all brand-new. Just ask if you need more. What's happened to your head? Nothing serious, just a fall. Oh, I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything. Wow, so many toys! Mr wong said that he fell down two flights of stairs last night. Then a man told him to send ten boxes of toys to our school or he'd be kicked back up to the second floor tonight. Good morning. Did you get the toys? Mr wong is in fact a very nice man. We talked about charity last night. He was so moved that he ordered the toys to be delivered overnight. You got them? Why would a man's head be bandaged if he was moved? Didn't he tell you that he was so moved that he wept uncontrollably, fell down and hit his head on the ground? Stop lying! Don't you know it's a dirty thing to do? I thought you were different from other men but I was wrong. I'll send the toys back to the factory. Don't hassle them any more. Yes, I am a scumbag. I play dirty. I don't know how to be persuasive. But he deserves a lesson for how he treated you. If you think I'm wrong what if I pay for the toys? I am grateful for your help but please help by using decent means. The saying has it that a man of 40 is a fool but you're a fool at the age of 30. You're the boss and yet you work as a volunteer. You're such a fool! I never know how to do things by using decent means, so I just follow what she does. Sending money or gifts would do. Ka-hsi says that the old folks are lonely people. They need someone to talk to, to bring them joy. "It's snowing, the palace is dark." "The lanterns shine on the flowers." "The wedding night ended tragically.” "I don't want any maids to serve me." Let's leave here. Is that it? Go away. I'm going! - What are they singing? - God knows. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. Look at the moustache! Abracadabra. Abracadabra... What's so funny? Abracadabra. Abracadabra. What are they doing there? The moustache, the moustache... There you are! Kissing behind the cloth. You are naughty! Why don't we have some fun too? Why not? Dinner is served. That was quick. I didn't cook anything complicated. Come over. Tinned fish in black bean sauce. We thank god for providing us with our daily bread. We pray thee give us strength. Amen. We thank god for providing us with our daily bread. We pray thee give us strength. Amen. Are you a Christian? Not really, but when I was a child, a girl gave me food. She taught me to say grace before every meal. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. I don't believe in Jesus but I do say grace. Every time I recite the words, I remember that in this world, there was a girl who helped me when I was most in need. Her name was ka-hsi. And you are... I was the beggar-boy ho-tien. I wanted to tell you on the day we met. But I didn't have the courage. Because I have never in my life done anything you regard as right. I didn't tell you who I was until I'd become a volunteer. I wonder if you are willing to befriend someone like me. It's a special way of meeting up with an old friend. - Let's eat. It's getting cold. - Sure. What's wrong? It's very sweet. Is it really? Tinned vegetable is supposed to be sweet, didn't you know? It's not bad. These are ok, if you are not launching a coup. As long as you like them. I'm an honest businessman. You can return them if you're not satisfied. You have to return to Hong Kong? What's so funny? Many years ago, you told me that you were leaving, as you are doing now. There was one day in my life that I always remember. The day you left. I didn't know which boat you were on, so I waited at the pier from Sam. I wanted to tell you how sad I felt. But I didn't say anything when I saw you. I might have been too young then. But now I know, I'm very fond of you. I want you to be with me. I've had a wish since I was young. That is, to be able... Able to see you again. You may think I'm a fool, and perhaps could never think of marrying a man like me, but I always wanted to marry a woman like you. I have to go back to Hong Kong. But I want you to go with me. Do you know why? Don't worry, I tell you. It's an important event. But you are marrying a woman, not a golden hill. You don't understand. I do. You want to move out after you get married. That is the right thing to do. You and Alan are not gay, are you? You're worried that he'd be jealous? What a silly thought! Oh, Alan! So you're back. Let me help you. Brother. You've put on weight. That's down to good living. Are things going well? I've done two things in Thailand. I succeeded in one and failed in another. Succeeded in what? I succeeded in striking a deal. Failed in what? I found a woman. You didn't? Hey, she's really gorgeous. Let me help you. Let me introduce you. Jenny, ah tien and Richard. Hello, sister-in-law. This is my home. This apartment suits you. It's pathetic. You're teasing me as usual! The feng-shui of this house is very good. Everything has gone smoothly since we moved in. Ah tien, let's chat in the bedroom. Chat? You should at least show me around the house. You have such poor manners! All right, come along with me. This is my brother's, nothing to see. This is my room, even worse. You must take a look in this room. Really? It's just a storeroom, what's so special about it? Nothing special indeed. But it is interesting for me to look. Open the door! What are you playing at? This is my house rule. A nosy woman has to sit in there for two years. I don't believe that you're not going to let me out. Tell Alan while he's in such a good mood. If you don't do it, I'll go. Don't be stupid. What are you afraid of? I want to get a proper job. You want to quit? Ah tien! Coming! What is it? Where's my grey suit? It's at the cleaners. Let me out or I'll burn down your house! What do you think of her? Ok as a mistress but too fiery to be a wife. I don't want to get married yet. It's more important to make money. Money attracts women. You bastard, let me out! The same applies to you. If the business in Thailand goes well, I'll be away a lot. You'll have to look after the business here. It isn't easy to take care of such a big team of staff. You've got to take it seriously. I don't want to carry on any more. What did you say? I don't want to do it any more. Say that again? I want to do something legal. What are you talking about? I want to quit this business. I've met ka-hsi again. She asked me to marry her. What makes you think you can do something legal? Didn't you steal even when you were starving as a child? Yes, I did, but I don't want to steal any more. Why can't you put yourself in my shoes? You're walking out on me just when I need you most. All for the sake of a woman. Have you put yourself in my shoes? That's not what I mean. You want to walk away for a woman. No woman should ever come between us. Take a look at her, the woman I love most. I wouldn't let her stand in our way. What do you mean? You can't take me for granted. I take you for nothing. Get out! All you want is brotherhood. So you're gay, aren't you? I'll give you a good hiding for that. He lives up to his words when he loses his head. Let's go. - Take her away! - Let's go. You son of a bitch. Can't you see what I did, for the sake of you? Can't you do the same for my sake? No, I can't. I'd give up my life for you but I can't live without ka-hsi. I'm sorry. I'm off now, brother. I'll come back when you need me. Bye-bye. Let's go. I've been hiding a secret from you ever since I've been working for you. What is it? It's a little embarrassing. I helped my father to collect night soil when I was small. As I grew up, I found it a shameful thing to do, being a man. So I told my dad that I wanted to sell rice pastries instead. He took it as if I were despising him and he got angry. He said I was ungrateful. But being grateful had nothing to do with collecting night soil. There wasn't anything wrong with selling rice pastries. At least I could take home leftovers, which you can't do with night soil. My dad was so stubborn that he was still cross with me on his death bed. I did all the duties as a son at his funeral. I was heart-broken. What are you trying to say? Tell me straight. Brother, don't be cross with ah tien. He's got other ambitions. He only wants to move on to something else. Why don't you let him? Love is all that matters. Being together doesn't mean anything. Don't talk about him any more. Brother, you must've found it a little lonely without ah tien now. Perhaps it's about time to have a woman around you. That would stop people from gossiping that you were both gay. I beg your pardon? I didn't say that. I never said anything. I'm exhausted after the walk. Would you let me in to have a rest? Please come in. Hi, Alan. We haven't seen you for a while. Was the trip to Thailand good? We could've thrown a party of celebration for you... Had you told us of your return. That isn't necessary. I had to thank you for your help or I would've been dead by now. But my days aren't numbered yet. Instead, I made a good profit. I should treat you to a good meal. A meal is not enough. I deserve a share of your takings. Your 20% share is negligible but my 80% share is a huge sum. I beg your pardon? My 20%? Hold it. Calm down. I always uphold my principle of sharing takings with others. But the pie will only be dished out after I've taken my bite. I don't take it all for myself. All my men and associates here need a bite of it as well. We agreed that everyone who witnessed the deal would have a share. I didn't know we'd have a share. Are you forfeiting yours then? No, of course not. - Good. You'll have a share too. - Yes, we all have a share. Didn't you hear? The deal was made on my suggestion. Refusing me a share means you're refusing them a share too, which means you're on bad terms with all of us. Think it over. Why can't I dish it out myself? They'd have whatever you'd give them. Everyone would have a share except you. You heard what he said? It's him who's bearing me a grudge. He's playing games with me. You're a wanted man. Everyone in your family must die too. I'll have all of you killed. From now on, you're either with me or against me. Alan, I'm terribly sorry. I understand. Brother. It's going to be a head-on clash with kao. Tell everybody to lie low. It's ah tien's wedding tomorrow. He insists that you're there. It's time now to sever all my relationships. It's time to start the ceremony now. Where is everybody? Sorry, father. They're on the way. Let's wait a little longer. - Need hurry. - I'm sorry. We can't wait much longer. - Brother. - Brother. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Brother, I knew you'd come. That's right. I had to come because we grew up together. We used to be on the same boat. But from now on, we'll go our separate ways. I didn't realise we'd meet for the first time at your wedding. Perhaps it'll be your wedding when we meet again. It was such a hurry that I didn't prepare for anything special. I hope you like it. Thank you. Bye-bye. Brother. Brother, please... Mind your own business. Where are we going now? It's my brother's wedding. Where else do we go, apart from their banquet? It's no fun playing on your own. Shall I throw the bottle and you hit it with the stone? Ready? What's wrong? If I had a daughter, it'd be good if she took after you. What do you mean? I can give you what you want. The fortune-teller said that I'd have a few kids. I thought to propose to you like this three days ago. But now I want to split up. Why? I fell in love with you at first sight. It's because you're bitchy. My woman has to be bitchy. To me, there are two truly important people in the world. One is ah tien and the other is you. But there's a time to say goodbye. I can only face it once, twice is too much for me. I would rather split up now and keep a sweet memory. That's right. When a train stops at a station, it'll leave sooner or later. Ok, let's enjoy ourselves tonight. What? I said, we should enjoy ourselves tonight, shouldn't we? - Keep a look out, will you? - Ok. The goods are all here. Good, well done! - Hey, mate! - What's up? It's all there. Bring them here! Thanks. Say hello to uncle pui. He says you're to come to Thailand for some fun. Alan, are you ok? - Am fine, how about you? - Fine. How about others? Get back there. On boy! Watch out! Ah-chih! - Don't. - You can't stop me. Hey, hsiao-feng! Hsiao-feng! Alan! Get in, quick! Let's get out of here! I can't leave now! You've got to, for the sake of the brothers. He's getting away, stop him! - Ta-feng! - No! Why did you come? I wanted to return the cheque. You're too tight. It's not enough to buy me. Would it hurt if you stopped being such a bitch? You told me you liked bitchy women. But from now on, I won't be so bitchy. I want to tell you that I don't regret meeting you. I want to have a son, your son, one that's like you. Jenny... Jenny Jenny thank you very much. Boss, what do you want to eat? You decide. - The usual, then. - Fine. Magic... Where do you think you're going? I want a club sandwich. Hey, silly, a club sandwich is no good. Let's have another drink. That was close! You almost got my trousers. Is that better? Yes, throw it up, and you'll fell better. Miss! Sir, I'm trying to run a business. I understand. Miss, are you ok? This is for you. Don't be shy. Sort it out. Thank you. All right, let's go. Good job you didn't ruin my trousers. Leave it. Making a living is never easy. It's disgusting, let me do it. Tell the brothers to do it, then report to me. Yes. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Let's go to eat. Look at the money I have won see, didn't I tell you? Are you interested, brother-in-law? Have a flutter on my horses. No, thanks, you can save your rotten tips for your cronies. I want you to help our investigation. My help? Do you have anything on me? Unfortunately not yet. But I hear that you're in the middle of a big gang war. If you want to cause trouble, please make it big. We'd love you to. Otherwise, how do we get the evidence against you? Why are you so childish? Don't you know how big I am? I'm not so big I don't need to bother with the kids. They don't know who they're dealing with. I don't want any trouble and even if I did, you couldn't do anything. There must be something wrong with your genes. Otherwise, why are both your sister and you so dumb? It's my family's misfortune that my sister has married you but I won't let you get away with that! Tell us! I really don't know. Stop that! You don't get any answers like that. Use your brains. Are you going to tell us? I really don't know. Are you? Or I'll shoot you. - But I really don't know - Dad... Run, son, quick! Quick! Dad... I'll kill you if you move. Things are different with a kid. Are you going to tell us now? Please let him go. He's innocent. Innocent? Don't! I really don't know! Don't! Ok. It's obvious you don't know. Son! Brother. Kao... I'll kill him. Ah tien. Richard ah tien. Alan he... is in trouble. What's happened? - Ming is... - Tell me! Ah tien. Ah tien, Alan says you have to close the business, leave Hong Kong with ka-hsi, otherwise kao and his gang will get you. Alan says you should carry on with what you're doing and be a decent man. No matter what happens, do not return to Macau. What is it? Are you mad? What's wrong? Don't be silly. You want to talk to me? What do you want me to say? Will you listen? Can I stop you going? I'm an orphan, I was prepared never to marry. It's fate that we met again. Being with you for so long, I'm so happy. If it's fate that I become single again, I cannot help it. I know I shouldn't go back. But I have a reason. I have to go back. If Alan hadn't looked after me, I wouldn't be here. I can leave him when he prospers, but I must stand by him when he needs help. I know it's unfair on you. But I've no choice. I want you to understand. I hope you come back safely. I will. - Coffee. - Thank you. It's time for us to go. Take care! I will. Thank you god for providing our daily bread, we pray thee... Ah tien! What is it? Kao is at the trotting club, I think Alan is also going. Hey, ah tien! Wait for me, ah tien! I'm going too, wait! Why didn't you wait? - Let's go to the stables. - Yes. Good morning, kao. Kao, you've got a very good horse here! In my experience, after some training, it's going to win. Of course, if it doesn't make money, I'd better get a dog-trainer. You're right. What do you call it? Think of a name. "Wonderful". Too kitsch. "Top of the world". This is good. What're you doing? Guard boss Run, boss. Boss, run. Boss, run. Come, kill him. Shoot! But he's our man! Shoot, don't worry about him, shoot! Don't boss, no! Just shoot! Go, get him! Go, get him! Alan! Alan! Ah tien! Kill him! Kill them! Brother! Hold it, Alan, ah tien. We're a family, aren't we? We can always talk. No, no! Please. Got you. Hold it. Never mind me, shoot him. Shut up. Why don't you shoot me? With luck, you still have a bullet left. I've always been lucky. Why don't you fire? Sir, it's serious. The shooting's been going on for ages. - Superintendent chen. - What's the situation now? There are lot of fatalities. Apart from kao, your brother-in-law, Alan and ah tien are in there. Listen. This is superintendent chen. You're under siege now. Unless you surrender, you don't stand a chance. Brother-in-law! I'm being held by these two thugs here. Help me! Hold it, Alan. I'm coming in now. We can always talk it through. This is all their doing. Arrest them! Keep calm. It's too late. Cool it. Put down your gun. Shoot. It's too late. I'm the victim here. Help me! Hold it, everyone! Drop your guns! What did I say just now? Luck is always on my side. What do you kill me with now? Straw? Like hell! Brother. - Shut up, all of you! - Brother... It's ok that you can't avenge him today. But you can be a witness in court. He's getting on. It won't make much difference when he's given 20 years. Fine. You'll get a promotion and I'll be in the Nick it's better than being killed by them. Brother-in-law. Aren't we family? Standby. I've always wanted to kill him. I've never had the chance before. I'm really sorry that you're going to take the blame for his death too. No one'd think that it was me, his brother-in-law, who killed him. We'll die together! You're going to hell. There's no bullet! Fire. I am sorry. My brother.
