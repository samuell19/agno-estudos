Time. Time, time. Oi, oi. Look at me. Look at me. - You all right? - Yeah. Ain't no place for you, boy. That's my grandpa! Jack Slack's blood, eh? Got him, eh? He's a fart. Throw him up there, lads. Come on! Look at that. I see you've had some experience. Oh! He's a tough ‘un. Come on! Here's a hard ‘un. Ain’t ya? Ain’t ya? Not much to count for. Carriages were stopped on their way in again. Put your hand out, boy. Handsome lad. Bit skinny, though. Yeah. He's a runt. Just like his father was. Oh, Joe. That's what I was waiting for. - What’d I tell you? - But, Ma! Hold your tongue! Get home. He likes watching his granddad fight, Mary. Like you did when you was his age. That's in the past. He ain't got it in him to do what you did. He's just a boy. Give him time. I told you... I don't want him in your world. You stay away from him. He's a Belcher, Mary. You, me, Jem... we're all cut from the same cloth. You leave him alone. Bless us... Oh, Lord... for the gift of food we are about to receive. We come to You... for strength... knowing that You are our provider. Amen. What's the matter, Gilly? Here. Have mine, pet. It's all we got. Come on. Place your bets. Come on. Place your bets. Place your bets. What are you doing here? I wanted to see the chickens. Chickens? Oi? I'll put that on Lancelot. I've got a big oner on Lancelot. Who can match him? Come on. When we win... I'll give you the dead bird to take home. Yes! Come on! Come on, Lancelot. Get him! Come on, Lancelot! Come on now! Come on now! Hotspur is the winner! Hotspur is the winner. Hey! I know you fixed that fight. I want my money back. A bet's a bet, Jack. I want my money back. You know the rules, mate. Why don't you double up on the next one? I've got my eyes on you. Maybe you should keep your eyes on the boy. Oi! - Come back here, you little runt! I told you not to take anything from him, Jem. Come here. You don't want blood on your hands. Dad. What you doin’ here? I need to talk with you. Right. Sit. Come on. Sit. Have a swig with your old man. I came to talk about Jem. He needs... love, kindness. He don't need no lessons in... pain from you. I'm not doing him any harm. He needs... a father. He needs... someone he can look up to. You need to tell him to stop coming here. No. No, he needs a man... to teach him about discipline and the like. He ain't gonna learn that from you. I paid for the clothes on your back. And I paid for the cross around your neck. I have worked every day of my life. And you drink it all away. Don't you? What do you want me to say to the boy, Mary? He's your son. Just stay away is all. Don't encourage him. If you tell him to stay away, he'll stay away. Please, Dad. Oi, Belcher! What a pretty outfit you've got there, Belcher. Off to the docks, are we? Look at him. Little molly. And what's this, Belcher? Hmm? Something for your ma's cupboard? We all know she's a favourite with the sailors. Go on, say something. I dare you. - Your teeth stink like shit. - Plant him one, Archey. - Yeah, mate. Come on, now. - Ooh. Look at him. He thinks he can fight like his grandad. He weren't even good. You're dead, Belcher! Enough! Go on, get you going, or I'll pay a visit to each of your fathers. Stand you up straight, boy. Violence is as much about taking pain as it is inflicting it. Does your mother know you're here? Ain't much she don't know. When you fight... one hand follows the other. A man who punches with both hands... and keeps punching... that's the fighter who's gonna win. Cryin'... it's ain't gonna help. In life... don't no one give two shits about you. The only way to protect yourself is to attack. To fight. Can you teach me more? Can I teach you more? Well, perhaps over a drink, huh? Mary. I need money. Shame on ya. Quiet, child. You're in the house of God. Look at ya. You're a disgrace. Don't bear grudges. Your husband... he ain't coming back. You ain't done nothing but bring shame on us. You have a mouth on ya. Haven't you, Mary? Just like your mother. You look a lot like her in this light. Leave. Just leave us. I will. You drunken bastard. Here, one hand follows the other. Thank you, Lord... for your gift. Oh, he’s mine and you know he’s mine. Here you go, love. Go on. Strike it in the center, Belcher! There's a line of men to take your place if you can't pull your weight. Problem, Jem Belcher? No, sir. At least, it's something. Yeah. Come on. Fresh custard tarts. -Oi! -It was him! - Learn some manners! - No, no! It wasn't me. It was him! Learn some manners. What about you, sir? Can I interest you... no? - Do you wanna dance? - No! - Come on! - No! Dance! Stop. Stop! Hey, Jem. Come here, though! Come on. The undefeated Bob "Blackbeard" Britton chalks up another victory! RINGLEADER Come on! Will any other pretender to his throne please step forward? It behoves me to personally offer up... my whole purse... to any man who can last one round with Bob "Blackbeard" Britton! That's a lot of coin. Here. Jem, what are you doing? We need those coins. Are you joking? He'll kill you. What's your name, son? Jem. Jim? Jem Belcher. I'm the bummer. I'm sure you're gonna give us a great show. Ladies and gentlemen! One Jem Belcher! Mm? A diamond in the rough... if ever I saw one. My money's on the skinny fellow. How much? I'll take that bet. Gentlemen. To your corners. Time! Get in there. Jem, stop. He's gonna kill ya. No, get back in! Beautiful. Come on, Jem! Yes! Come on, Jem. Where's my coins? Why don't you come work for me? You can have one of these every week. We’re good. Diamond in the rough. Close the door. Tom! You close the door! Just close it. What? If I find out you stole this... Don't be silly, Ma. We earned it good and proper. Well, you took your time. You can't just walk away from a shout when someone offers you a drink. Don't do all your drinkin' in public. You don't wanna hurt your name by being stupid. Seen yourself lately? I don't need to. I wake up every morning in this flesh. Same flesh, same stench. Suits me fine. Gotta know who you are in life. Money comes and goes as does women. It's you who decides what kind of man you're gonna be. When your grave's filled and your flesh rots away... all you leave behind is your name. Go on. You're more fun to be with now that you drink. The smithy said I might find you here. The name's William Warr. You can call me, “Bill”. I watched you fight in the forest. Well, that, uh... that Britton is a tasty pug. But... you licked him like a fool. He was tired. I got lucky. You weren't lucky. No, you... you beat a stronger, more experienced fighter just usin' your noggin'. Yeah. You see them? Yeah. Them gulls... Every year, they built their nests in them cracks. And every year, they get fucking washed away. Sometimes... a clever bastard comes and only builds his nest right around the cliff. Now, you're raw. But with some guidance, you could be like one of them. Well, unless you wanna work all your life for a pittance, covered in shit and black smoke. I'm a blacksmith. I'm fine. Then why did you cross that rope? It's in your blood. Eh? Now, you come and see me. And I'll put you at the top of that cliff. Grandad? Grandad? Pass me that bottle, boy. You're going to be a great fighter. Listen to Bill Warr. Did he guide you? As far as he could. Oh, he was not a good listener like you are. How did you end up like this? We are born alone. And we die alone. But you're not alone. I'm here. Every man is alone, Jem. It’s up to you now... you're the man of the house. You're the one that would put bread on the table. Don't worry about me. I'll be good. I'll be good, good. Have compassion and thy mercy on my father's soul. Forgive him, his sins... and grant that we may see him... in the joy of eternal brightness... that is Christ the Lord. Now, look, all talent can be natural. But control needs to be learned. And this is the place you'll learn control. But before we go there, you need to know what brought you here. What do you mean? Well, your blood. Your great grandfather was James Figg. You know, the father of tactical fighting. You got some of the best pugs pumpin' through your veins, boy. Now, Jack... he was a monstrous hitter. Had a jaw like a fucking rock. You know, but he wouldn't train. Had no discipline. But the best thing was crowds fuckin' loved him. He was hardly a bev. Thank God, you've got your mother's looks, you know? What do looks have to do with fightin'? You'll soon find out. Jack, he... he used to like gettin' hit, you know? He'd stop a punch with his face. He loved it. It ain't no good for your appearance, and it ain't no fuckin' good for your noggin. I don't wanna end up the way he did. He was a grumpy old bastard, but... No, you'll be all right as long as you learn control. All right? Now, show me your stance. The way you stand. Why don't you get a little bit on the balls of your feet? That's it. Put your arms up. Good. Turn a bit. Lovely. That's it. Look me in the eyes. You see, there's something weird. You see my hands. You see my feet. Don't look down. Do you see my feet? Yeah. You see, the eyes are the windows to a man's soul. You can read him. He’s ain't no good without this. You can't rely on natural ability alone. Boxing's an art. It's a craft. Boxers like, um... like writers, they stand alone. What happened to you? Well... Ah, well, you don't get thick grubs like these from just working in the mill, do ya? Thirty-one pugs, unbeaten... until Mendoza. You fought Daniel Mendoza? Yeah. Daniel fuckin' Mendoza. Anyway, that's a story for another time. Where’s your hand? Right. All I want you to do... is slip and move. Without my hands? Yeah. That's stupid. Yeah. Then why am I doing it? Because I'm in charge. And you need to learn to fight without your hands. You shouldn't have any problem duckin' out the way of an old man like me now, should ya? What? Now, move. Don't get hit. That's it. Duck and move. Move, move. Beautiful. That's it. Shoulders. Watch, square on me. Don't be squared off. Lovely. Lovely, lovely, lovely. When do we leave? Ooh! Hold your horses. Invitations are sent out all the time to up-and-coming fighters, you know, for an easy win. I mean, the champion's tough and he's unbeaten. And he's a dirty fighter. I don't care. I'm ready. - I'll do whatever it takes. - Well, he ain't no pug. He's a champion. What's the purse? One hundred. Right. Listen. This is how it's gonna work. We gotta cut it right down the middle, 50-50. Any expenses comes outta your purse. Deal? - Deal. - Good. Jem, are them your fightin' clothes then? Of course, not, Gilly. This is what they all wear in London. Ain't it, Bill? Yeah. Mm-hmm. You look like Captain Queernobs. It's fashionable. - Ain't it? - If you're French. Oh, it's a waste of cloth if you ask me. - Show him the paper. - Oh, yeah. Make you look like a proper gentleman. Hey, Jem, look at this. Oh. Don't even look like you. Yeah. It's, uh, difficult to capture such a staggering beauty. "Young Jem Belcher. Unbeaten. Fighting for the championship of England." Bill. Mary. All right. Quick. I'll see you out, Jem. You don't know what you're doing. You'll end up in the gutter like your grandfather with nothing to show for it. I ain't like him, Ma. Never will be. Same path of damnation. This is different. We'll be better off. I promise. You don't know the ways of the world, Jem. Fighting's for the betting man. People like us only lose. That's not true, Ma. You're wrong. Alright, you Londoners. Settle down. Settle down. And now, the challenger from the West Country. Jem Belcher will fight the mighty Irish champion, The Stonemason! Ladies. Ain’t that something? Hmm? Breathe. Nice and deep. Breathe. Make sure you capture all this, Mr. Egan. Now, he's got a very dangerous left cross. All right, so I want you to move to the right. Want you to think. That's where the fight's won. Pass me your handkerchief. - All right? - Is that him? Hmm. Gentlemen and ladies. The time has come. Are you ready for the main event? You know the rules. No rabbit punching, no biting, no thumbs in the eye. Any tools found, big or small, you'll be disqualified. And you won't receive a penny. If one of you gets knocked down, you have 30 seconds to get back up again. A hungry audience here today. Let's give them a display of pugilism at its finest. And not another dogfight. Off to your corners! Time! Move. Oh, no, no, no. Away from the ring! Time. Time. Time! What did I tell you? No rabbit punching! - What the fuck was that? - He's fast. He'll pound you into the fucking ground if you don't move. See these? They're your shields. Right? Don't let anything get in your head. This crowd, they're not here for you. Fucking remember that. Now, you keep your chin down. All right? Go ahead, knock his fucking block off. Time! Time! Fuck you, tough. Umpire. They're fighters, man. Let them fight! Better. When he sets himself, have a little walk. Yeah? Let him burn himself out. Now, find a way in beyond the check. Round three! Jab his puss off. Time! Do your rounds. Yeah. Snuffed. The winner, from Bristol, young Jem Belcher! Well done. This will make the front page across the whole country. Yeah! Magnificent display of pugilism. Thank you, my lord. And for inviting us into your... - wonderful home. - Yeah. Champion of England. Always welcome at the Ashford estate. Anything you may want, my servants will oblige. My lord. Hmm. What do we do? Well... You hear that, Bill? Anything we want. Yeah. Fucking tasteless. -Oh. -Is that for us? Thank you. Gentlemen, I would be honoured if you were to join me for a drink. Chin, chin. - Is it... is it hot? - An interesting idea. But alas, no. I mean, what's all this? - Is it a trick with the eyes? - No trick. Something special from the Antichrist in France. They call it “champagne”. Champagne. Care to try? Yeah. I don't believe we've had a proper introduction. I am Lord Rushworth. Pleasure. Please. We'll be as drunk as emperors after indulging in a few of these little darlings. - A mere aspiration... - Here. For the more imaginative peasant. No death sentence more certain than poverty. I must say, your display today was dazzling. And it cost me a pretty penny. You showed a novel precision of the wrist and shoulder. How on earth did you manage such a feat? Floating round with the champion, Rushworth. Didn't take you long, did it? As you know, I have a predilection for winners. Especially, when they appear from nowhere. Bristol ain't nowhere. 4,045 nautical miles from the sugarcanes of Jamaica in fact. Rushworth regards fighters as a money-making apparatus with no other value. I simply believe that when one man wins, another loses. The thrill, as it were, is being on the side of the victor. Wouldn't you agree, Jem? I do. Then who am I to disagree with the new champion of England? Now, of course, pugilism has been around since the ancient Greeks, when it was a sport of natural beauty or an artform, and could be again. All God's creatures are furnished with appendages for their protection. So, why not turn them into instruments of profit? But every fighter should be one step ahead... so he can turn this into a proper sport. And you're quiet right, Lord Ashford. It should be viewed as an artform. I couldn't agree with you more. I will help arrange your next fight, Jem. There isn't a door in this city that's closed to a lord. Yeah, well, that's very kind of you, my lord. But we're fine for now. When opportunity knocks, one must answer. Speaking of opportunity... Bill. Excuse me. He's like a dog with two cocks. Give my best wishes to your lovely wife. And all the best to you, Lady Abigail. Thank you. Mr. Belcher. - Come. - Yeah. So... is this your first exposure to high society? It is. Well, the party was meant to be for the Irishman. But... not sure he felt like celebrating. You... you saw the fight? Well and truly. Are women not permitted at such events? Yes, of course. I mean... usually, I... I see a different type of women at the... fight. I mean... well... Have I made you uncomfortable, Jem? No. - Good. You'd be surprised at how many women enjoy the spectacle. You'll find many women in the crowds. You just have to take notice. The new champ toys have arrived. - Get me one. - Make way. Whoa! They look so real! In the meantime, we'll have some fun. - Ooh! - Ooh! Classy dresser. Mm. Huh? What are you drinking, Jem? Give me some. Champ. Time! Loosen up. How daunting. Yes! Yes. Hey! Well done, well done! We need more of that. Spectacle! Well, that was a different approach, wasn't it? Fantastic spectacle. Well done, well done. Mr. Warr. Hmm. So, Mr. Egan, will that demonstration excite your readers? Indeed, my lord, it will. Fresh bread! Come and get your fresh bread. Go on, step up. There you go. There’s two for you, darling. There they are. It's Jem's mum. Fresh bread, anyone? Come on, everyone. Fresh bread. Fresh bread, ladies? You must be proud of your boy, Mary. Jem Belcher. Champion of England. He beat Andrew Gamble black and blue. Yeah, you're right. Mm. Champion of England? Here, Ma. What's taking you so long? I'm just getting used to it. It's really very simple. You bet the checks on your best five cards. What use is it to invent a game only to have it outlawed a few years later? What do you expect? That's the French for you. Everything they do is backwards. Who do you suppose will be your next opponent? That depends on who's left. The ring has invigorated English life. A life you'll never find in William Wordsworth. Fighting provides a stepladder for a pauper to become a prince. I agree. But reading poetry should not be discounted as a worthy pursuit. I confess that I myself have quite a penchant for Mr. Wordsworth. So do Dandies. Soon, there will be ranks and weight classes. Men will need to reach and earn a certain level before challenging anyone. Yes, a fight's a fight, Egan. Let's not get bogged down in technicalities. On that note. I thought you were just getting used to it. Oh! Fold. I am out. Shall we raise the stakes before the last turn? You know what, it's not worth it. He bets like the king. Victory and defeat lie in wait side by side. All in, my lord. I'll join you. Oh! - Kings are rarely beaten. But the ace trumps the king. Well done. Very good. Very good. Another round, please, Jerry. Your lordship, could I have a... a private word, please? Spit it out. Yes, my lord. I... I do beg your pardon. It's just your line of credit is rather high and over its limit. Are you trying to embarrass me? No. Not at all. It's just... Pitiful scum. I could burn this place down tonight and no one would give two fucks! Stop it, Rushworth. I didn't mean to offend you, my lord, I swear. Shame on you, sir. This is not the conduct becoming an officer in His Majesty's Navy, retired or not. Hmm. Here's to me. Must be excitin', seein' new places. Yeah, it is. Tom and Gilly ask about you a lot. Everywhere I go nowadays someone asks about you. I miss them. I miss you, too. You can come back home whenever you want. You know that, don't you? Yeah. What'd I miss? Anyone to watch out for? Well, there's always someone worth watchin' out for. As long as I keep winnin', what else matters? What's that for? Champion or challenger, you turn up on my camp on time. I am the champion. Ain't that enough for you? Well, you're gonna make a choice. You either train like a champion or you get ready to be a loser. That's the first time you've called me a loser, Bill. Welcome to Fives. So, what's the occasion? Celebration of the well-heeled, the wealthy, and the immovability of our status. I see. Hierarchies exist everywhere. They're a natural course of life. Is that your theory, My Lord? Uh, not a theory, but a fact. You need only look at the animal kingdom, hmm, that are tuned to status in the same way we are. We are made to live this way. I do hope you're enjoying. We are living in a golden age, Jem. There's no better time to be alive. Hmm? Come. Ever boxed a kangaroo before? Can't say I have. They can be nasty bastards. I fought with one. The animal attempted kicking me in the gingambobs, hmm? You should try it sometime. Perhaps, I will. You know what I love about fighting? What's that? It's the only sport where money is made by men doing somethin' they'd ordinarily be locked up for. Never thought of it like that before. We can achieve even greater things than we already have. Oh! Careful, careful! Whoa, ho, ho, ho! I can see the champion of England takes his leisure activities very seriously. May I present, fresh fighting prospect, Henry Pearce. Jem Belcher. Jem Belcher, I'm a big fan. Pleasure to meet you, champ. Likewise. Shall we continue with the fun on the court, hmm? Ladies and gentlemen, myself, Your Lordship has challenged the champion of England to a Fives handball battle. Gather 'round and place your bets, hmm? After you. Oh! Oh! My eye! Jem, don't make such a fuss. Jem? Jem. Maybe you should go home and see the family. Do you good. I'm fine. Just sort the next purse. You can't see, can you? I can see just fine. You know. You know what I mean. I know who I am. I am Jem Belcher. I am champion of England. Your absence these past weeks has sent tongues wagging. I'm ready for the next fight. I admire your optimism, Jem, we must take things one step at a time. Like I said, bring me a challenger and I'll defend my title. I'm sure you will, however I have a responsibility to deliver what the people want. The people want me, not the challenger. Don't be naïve, Jem. This is a great spectacle of human courage we're talking about. It means engineering it first. I sell out crowds who pay to see me fight. Not only to see you fight, see you overcome adversity. We are telling them a story, you see? Before victory must come struggle. I struggled to become Champion of England! - Isn't that enough? - Yeah. Your story's not yet reached its conclusion, Jem. People wanted to see its final chapter. You won't control me. And you won't control the people. Without the people, Jem, you and I both are nothing. Don't worry, I'm not after your money. Straight in from the Americas. Better than the rat's piss they drink here. Ma? Lord Jesus, Bill was right. You can't stay over here. What you doin' here? What happened to your eye? Nothing. You're coming home with me. No, I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm not goin' anywhere. Don't you dare! Shame on you! Leave me alone! Leave! Watch it. You think we're after your money, Belcher? The great Jem Belcher has become a quivering little coward and a one-eyed pony. Are you okay, my friend? Huh? Uh, strange things happen to a... A man's mind in here. Don't let the darkness fool you. Our mother's womb gave us life after darkness. After nine months from darkness to light. Uh. That's all you're gettin', so make it last. Oh! "The new champion of England, one Henry 'The Game Chicken' Pearce, enjoys his new found fame and fortune under the auspices of Lord Rushworth in company both high and low." So says the very fine Pierce Egan, sportswriter without equal. In life, don't no one give two shits about you. I see the darkness no longer scares you. Fear can change the most stubborn creatures. Uh, you... you make no sense, old man. Uh, hey, young man, can you come... Come here a moment. Yes, just a moment. Uh. No, look into the mirror. Look into your eyes. See what's staring back at you. It's just me. No, I said "what", not "who". Yes. That's it. Self-hatred is staring back at you. Discipline yourself in the trivialities of life first, then all matters greater than this will follow. And only God determines the weal and woe of this world, but man controls his own mind, readying yourself for any such tempest of fate that may blow your way. The only blame that should weigh upon your shoulders, young man, is that of self-neglect. Now, you must embrace... Embrace the sovereignty of your own mind. You have anybody waiting for you on the outside? Family. But they're not expecting me. Who's waiting for you? No one in particular. Only death. Your debt has been paid, Belcher. Walter. Where's... where's Walter? That old bastard? He suffered long enough. Come on! Chop, chop! Yes. Walter. What happened to him? It'll be all right. Let's dig in. You know, you've become quite the hero 'round here. Not sure I feel like one. What took you so long to come back? I don't know. Well, we never would've got by without you. You know, no proper food, new clothes. I mean, even new shoes. I'm glad you came home. We all are. Can I see your eye then? Oh, Gilly, don't be silly. It's okay, she can see it. Still got my good one. Is it true that the ladies in London have a different dress every day? Yeah, probably. London's a big fairground. You can have fun and enjoy it, but too much can make you feel sick. I wanna go there. What is this? It's asparagus. It's what they eat in London. Wash your hands... in salted water after each fight. That way you keep 'em in good shape. It's good to be home. "Oh, Lord, I give my life to you, I trust into you." "Show me the right path, oh, Lord. Point out the road that I should follow. Not remember the rebellious sins of my youth." Remember me... in the light of Your unfailing love. Oh, Lord." Oi. - You're chirpy. - Yeah. 'Cause I just seen Bill. Really? How is the old fart? The old fart wants to give you another chance. He couldn't tell me that himself? Fuck sake, Jem. This is good. Just... you just gotta be at his barn in the mornin'. Right? No excuses. He believes in you, Jem. We all do. I'll see you in the mornin', yeah? And don't be late. Turn your glove over. There you go. Get used to these quick. All things have changed since you was last in front of the ropes. You got a lot to learn. Hmm? How does that feel? No, you... no, you, look... Uh, you're... you're fucking slow and you're fucking weak! And we ain't got time for fuckin' mistakes. Come on. Henry Pearce is ferocious and he'll knock a fuckin' hole in you! You gotta work harder than you've ever fucking worked in your life! Work! That won't work. Push your fuckin' self. Come on, work. One chance. You're running like my mother. But you gotta ask yourself do you really want this. Do you? Where is it? You gotta work, work, work, work. Well, move about on your toes. That's it. I want you to get in there. Oh, see that meadow? Get in there, take your shoes off. Henry Pierce is gonna hunt down. He' gonna come looking for you. And you ain't fucking fought no one like him before. Come on, Jem, we've been here all day! Shh! - What are you? - Champion of England. Now, fuckin' hit him. Hurt him! Jab! Henry Pierce. Higher. In you go. Keep on your toes. What's the mud for, Bill? Uh, it strengthens the legs. You look sharp. Not yet, you don't. It ain't no game if you get stuck. You gotta move. Come on, move. Jem, we can come back tomorrow. You gotta punch through it. Work it! Beat, beat, beat! Throw the shoulder. Beat! Beat! Now, try and catch one of them blue flies. Which one? It's blue. Push, push, push, push. Bam! Lovely. You know what I call these creatures? The Egyptians called 'em "thunderer of the Nile." Come on, Jem, if you can take this, Pearce won't have anything for you. Champion of England, champion of England. Champion of England. Champion of England. Champion of England. Hmm. Betted it all on Pearce. The day we've waited for is finally upon us. The heroic Jem Belcher, grandson of the mighty Jack Slack himself, will lock horns with Henry The Game Chicken Pierce in an epic battle for the championship of the United Kingdom. Today marks the evolution of the sport and shall be spoken of for generations to come. June 26th. The Championship Prizefight in Victoria. Proving the young can outsmart the old, the champion dancing in the ring... This will top it, though. It's bein' talked about across the whole country. - First... - Move your hands. The great James Figg. Then his grandson, your grandfather, Jack Slack. And now, historian's ink is poised to etch your name - in its annals! - There you go, young man. Tomorrow will be an historic day for the sport and for you, Jem. It's the catalyst of a new wave of smart, Scientific pugilism. Keep your spirits high. You deserve to win this one, champ! Oh, fuck. Oh. What do you want here, Rushworth? - It's Lord to you. - Oh. Or has your memory gone soft? Well, there ain't no lords here. We're simply here to wish the challenger the best of luck, as any honourable gentlemen would in today's free world. We don't need luck. How does it feel knowin' what was once yours is now mine? It won't last. Your pitiful excuse won't get you no free pass tomorrow. We're similar, you and me. I can see it. Only difference is I'll be the one walkin' away with a heavier bag of coins. We'll see. Jem. Take care of that precious eye. All right, let's get back to the graft. How about moving? When your grave is filled and your flesh rots away, all you leave behind is your name. Good luck, Jem. Be careful. You know, I can't bear to watch you fight. I know you'll win. Jim Belcher! Come here. Pace yourself and protect that eye. Box him. Don't get into a slugging match. Be smart. You got a the bigger area there, so turn that into your advantage. And move. Finish him as per our agreement. Make it look good. You want this? - Do you want this? - Yeah. Go on.
