No, I'm there. Totally. That's perfect. My name is Cole. I'm represented by Crescent Talent- -and I'll be reading for Elway. Figured I was going to do some movement here. Male voice- Yeah. Yeah. We should split up. We could cover more ground that way. Shit... That soon? You'll have to talk to my agent. Damn! Cash? One day shoot? I mean... we'll tell my agent after. Oh, holding this and saying the slate? Okay. Bella and I'm here reading for the role of Mallory. What are you seeing exactly? Are you seeing this up or like... this up? I think he's gone. It's okay. We're safe now. Can I do that again? Female voice- Sure. Thanks. Don't do this! Please... Please don't do this! What's up. Brice reading for the role of... B.G.? Beege! female voice-No more scaring me. I don't like it. I promise I won't. That does not mean I can't make you scream. female voice- Is that so? Oh yeah.

Nobody is going to die here. Puh ugh! Oh fuck. Oh god. No, yeah. I was told his ugh- Directing is unusual I mean whatever man. This- This career takes sacrifice. You know. male voice- Hey hey guys! male voice- What's up man? Come on in. male voice- Hello. How are we? Ladies? Good. Death Cast! It's not very flattering. -No, it's... it's hot. -Where's my butt? You can't be posting this. -No! Don't delete it! -Too late. They take your cell too? -Yeah... Dude this better not be the shit we have on set. I can't eat anything if they expect me to fit into this. - Ooh Hey what time's the table read? Dance rehearsal? -Didn't you read the script? -Oh yeah. That parts stupid. Just trying on some funky eighties' clothes. B.G. is going to be looking fresh for the first day of filming tomorrow. Until he dies. That good? It's the first day of shooting. Very excited to bring Stefanie to the screen. Yeah. My character does die pretty quick in the story, but... She's got a few scenes before that so hopefully she'll be remembered. Okay, so right now I'm being wired up for sound. They've cleverly hidden a microphone in our wardrobe, so we won't be needing a sound guy with us on set. Sorry bro. So, it was like super boring. You're late pal. You need to be dressed. -Now? My first film like this. Umm... I've worked on twelve smaller projects. I haven't seen those finished but... Yeah, no this is my big break. Woman's voice- - Well, you're in good hands now. So how did you hear about this gig? - Craigslist. I told them I'm a shooter too but... I guess they just needed a driver. So, did you meet the director? -No. Not in person. I think it's interesting what he's doing though. Usually a director -Directs? Yeah. Whenever I direct, I like to really get in the backstory of my actors. Figure em out. -You direct? -I do everything. -Well, you should take my card! -Sure. -Oh, ugh... They took our stuff actually. I don't have it. -Well, later. -If there was a call sheet... -Yeah. I just got a phone call with a pickup time and instructions. Umm... does everyone know the rules? -Rules? B.G.- Yeah, the stuff they went over at the table read? So... mounted cameras and drones are positioned around set. Cameras are rolling when we land. You'll begin scene seven as soon as you... -you focus on driving. Scene seven will begin as soon as we walk in the door. - Yeah. Everyone's made that very clear. Everyone know their lines? -Yeah. No interaction with the crew. No breaking characters. Gag weapons. Same shit we went over last night. As each character is wrapped, we report to the van that's waiting... - At the front of the property. I'll show you, it's easy. -Wrapped? -Dies! What if our body is still in the scene? -You fucking lay there. I've never been out this far. B.G.- Use it, we should be getting into character! We're almost there. ♪ Yeah I'm gettin' famous baby ♪ It aint no mystery baby ♪ I'm making history ♪ You're gonna know I made it ♪ Yeah I'm gonna be so damn famous. ♪ You ready for this babe? -Save it Romeo. Hey, you're going to do great. -Hey you too! I'm sorry in advance for when I call you a bitch. It's okay, Mallory deserves it. -thanks. Melissa, if I make it through this production I'm going to kill you for putting me here. Gabe-Oh, no you don't. It's, it's in the script. -You read it!? I'm impressed you got that far, considering Gabe wraps on what? - Page seventeen. - Come on guys. Let's just have fun. We're making a movie! So, you guys just walk straight up this trail and you'll see the house at the end. -I'll see you later? Mallory- Old Plymouth! Gabe- Wheels off already? Should we start here? - We're starting on scene seven. Was I the only one listening? -To yourself? -He's the pro! Mallory- You guys ready? Gabe- Oh yeah. B.G.- Is he going to wait for us? Stefanie- He has to, cameras are rolling. Mallory-I'm in character are you Tiffany? Tiffany- - Yeah. I give you, casa tio! -Casa de mi tio. - That's why I have a C in Spanish. I just don't understand why we had to park so far away. - There's no way old Plymouth was going to make it over that overgrown trail. Stefanie-Old Plymouth barely made it to the trail. - I still say it could have made it. - Unlike you I don't have money for a new transmission. Speaking of what's the deal? I thought your uncle was rich. -He was... -And crazy! ...or he didn't like having neighbors. Well, he had this place built on our family's ranch for him and his wife... - but she didn't want to live all the way out here. So, he just used it for ugh, fishing and hunting trips. Barbaric. -He was a sportsman. -Killing is a sport? -To some. How would your Uncle like it if he- -His uncle's dead. She didn't know. I'm sorry I... How did he die? You need to tell them. -Not necessary. -Now you have to. He was murdered. -Stefanie! Where? -Here! -Enough. How could you not tell us that? - I didn't know it was here! You can't be serious? No. I'm not staying here. - Come on guys, there's nothing to worry about. I'm sure it's not as bad as it sounds. -It is. - Hey knock it off. You know what she's been through. Alright, enough. Okay, maybe it's not something I like talking about. But it... It's not like there's anything wrong with the house. -Debatable. - Yeah, no. A person was just murdered here. That's all. -Mmm... two people. -Fuck babe. Okay, we're out of here. Gabe! - Guys! She's joking. -I have a dark sense of humor. You heard her. It was a joke. - Real funny. It doesn't make this place any nicer. Look, guys! We have the house to ourselves for the whole weekend. There's a lake down the trail for swimming. Private bedrooms... - I like that. There is a fridge full of beer And enough grass to put down a horse. -You know it! Gabe-Now would everyone please just loosen up and enjoy? Nothing to worry about. I got your back. -Thanks. Is that poisonous? Is that poisonous? B.G., is that poisonous? -Not anymore. But this might be! Hey! There it is! Fuck. Mallory- Is that real? It smells real... Gabe- Shhh! Stefanie- Pass that shit. Stefanie- You're up. Damn B.G. that's some... Damn B.G. that's some... - High class... - High class grass, right? Only the best. Hey now we just need some tunes. I don't have to smoke this if... -It's okay. Have you ever? -No. You don't have to. -Uh, Maybe later though. - If you want yeah, that'd be chill! Yeah... chill. No way! Tiffany do you still remember?! Come on! God I can't believe I'm doing this! - Come on! Come on babe! Five... Six... Seven... Eight! Shouldn't we wait? -For what? -I don't know... I mean. I want this. I just want our first time to be special. -It is. They're off to an early start. B.G.- Beers are kind of warm. ♪ Cool killer ♪ It's what you do to me ♪ Cool killer ♪ And then you claim- Let's hit that bong! I fuckin' love this girl! Where's big blue? Still in Gabe's trunk. -Fuck bro! Let's roll another joint? -No, big blue! Come on. I'll walk with you. Throw your swimsuits on, we'll hit the bong and then go for a swim. -Sounds good. Be right back! So, how's my boy doin? - Elway? - Yeah. -She likes him. She's just... -Prude? - She just needs time to get to know him. -That's why I'm thinking Maybe it takes us a little while longer to find that bong? - We just got here! - So? What you think? -You're bad. Looks like a deer. Maybe? Are you okay? Yeah. Let's just finish this. What killed it? -Something big. -Should we be out here? I'm being serious. You're such a jerk. What are we supposed to do? Just wait here? Fuckin' stupid. We're between scenes Liv. Jesus you're committed. Babe. Babe, I'm sorry. I shouldn't of done that. You have nothing to worry about. Do you believe them? - About Gabe's uncle? They're just joking. - That's not something you joke about. They were just fucking with Tiffany. I promise you're safe. -Okay. No more scaring me. I don't like it. - Doesn't mean I can't make you scream. -Is that so? The fuck? B.G. wait! Who would do this? - I don't know. How's this even possible? What are you doing? - Seeing what they took. Let's just go back. - And what? - I don't know. Fuck, Beege I'm scared. - It's just somebody fucking with us. - Who!? -I don't know but nobody's coming out here to steal a set of fucking tires. Mallory where you goin? -Back to the house. I'm not staying here! Come on. The bong! Fuck. Damn. You look nice. I mean... good. That's a... good swimsuit For you. - Thanks. What's wrong? I don't... think Stefanie wants me here. Why would you think that? -All that about Gabe's uncle. I don't know I just... She knows I don't like stories like that. -It's just how she is. -I guess. Look, umm... I don't want you to think that I asked you here to... -It's okay. I want to be here. What the!? The car. Somebody's fucking with us! What's going on out there? - Nothing. - That's not nothing! Go see! Probably another damn scorpion. What the fuck is going on here? - Your car. Somebody took off your wheels. - You're full of shit. - I saw it too! -It's sitting on cinder blocks. - Nobody's stealing tires out here. You lied to us. This isn't a fucking joke! Tell us what happened to your uncle! - Nothing! God damn. Look, it's got to be something. Probably Stefanie's shit-head brother followed us here to play a prank. -That's not a fucking prank. So tell us who's out there. -Nobody. You guys are getting all worked up. I'm sure there's an explanation. We'll figure it out and go on enjoying our weekend alright? Nobody's going to die here. Nobody's going to die here! What the fuck... Jack. B.G.- Jack. Mallory- What is this? What is this? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey it's good. - Do something! - Do something!

Maybe that's what we heard. -Okay so what do you want to do? -The keys are still in the van. -I am not going back there. -You survive in the script. -Yet this isn't the script! - Maybe it is! You know? Maybe that's what they want! -Well fuck what they want! What so then you die? - Jesus. Would you just work with me? Okay what do you want to do?
