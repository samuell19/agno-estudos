Written, produced and directed by: David Dazanashvili MAFTIR Got any ice? No. How much? 40 shekels. Mother fucker. I don't make the prices. Say, are you OK? Yeah, and you? Change! Where's Oxana? Out, smoking. Had anybody in? No. Dry. No. Dry. Oxana! Oxana! What are you doing here? Nothing, smoking, just smoking. I said, lay off this shit at work! No one wants to fuck a loaded whore!

Get out of here, you crack head. Fuck off! Get the hell out of here! Crack head. Fix yourself up and back to work. Don't dare come back here. Cockface. Are you OK? Thanks for the rescue... It's OK. I let him win this one... Thanks. I mean it. You're welcome. WEDNESDAY Why'd you bring this mutt? She's destroying my car. Where would you have me leave her? At the parlor with all them pervs? If she messes up my upholstery, I'll B-B-Q her. Rambo, he's only teasing. What a stupid name, Rambo. For a bitch. It's not the movie Rambo, it's the poet Arthur Rimbaud. The one getting it up his ass? So you know "Total Eclipse"? Good for you. No, but I had a feeling a faggot would be your hero. Just don't bring that "poet" to work. Got it? -Yeah, yeah. This dog is so stupid, he'll have us both done for. Cockface. I've been doing a lot of thinking over the past three years. About my brother Meir, about the reason I've been banged up in here for the past few years, and especially about the moment I'm getting out of here. Who's gonna wait for me outside, and take me home. That's him. It was supposed to be Meir. Not the Russians. Don't move I'll be right back. What's up? Fine. What's your problem? What do you want? I'm out of prison for 20 minutes and I don't feel like getting back inside any time soon, but if your Russian faces are stuck to my ass, it might speed up my getting back there. Got it, Russian faggot? Not now, Misha, not now. Have a nice day. I love this town, the memories I have of it. What I want is so simple, but everything's so complicated in South Tel Aviv. The Avitan family controls all the illegal gambling, drugs and protection racket. Francois Avitan is the head of the strongest crime family. His son, Shaul, was a childhood friend of mine, but things have changed. He's the one that wasted Meir. The bald guy is Reuven, number two in the organization, the executor. Their main competition are the Russians, who control all the prostitution business and escort parlors. Their boss, Arkadi, was a math teacher back in Russia, Vova, his right-hand man, runs his businesses, - Shit! And Misha, a fucking psychopath, who can never make up his mind is it that he loves most, his dog or violence. But the worst are Mickey and Barouch, the law. Mickey is the only one who gives me goose bumps. Barouch, his partner, has OCD and never fucks his wife, Rinat. Assi, Rinat's brother, is a an obsessive gambler, owing a shit lot of money to many bad guys. This is Shimi, my best mate, and my greatest fear is that I'll end up like him. Three weeks ago they wasted my brother, Meir. Meir controlled all the docks' protection kickbacks, and Jackie's bar in particular. I have 4 days to buy a Maftir at the synagogue, for my brother's soul, and then get the bastard that killed him even if it's Shaul Avitan. Ellio. What? Come here. What's the matter? Don't feel like talking to your older brother? What's this? A door. Okay. What's with the army? Fine, I have paratroopers' tryouts camp next week. Wow, keeping secrets, Ellio? Is this what you wanna do? You liked it there. You don't need to do everything I had done. It's what I think I want to do. Meir, you have 50 shekels for me? I'm going to shoot pool with Shimi and Shaul. The stamps' boy is now shooting pool? Shimi and I are trying to make a man out of him. If his dad couldn't, then... Never mind. Nothing's going right. Meir. Home. Why would Shaul do such a thing to me? Hey, snowball... I heard you were out, and I came straight away. What happened to your eye? Just a tiff with some mad pusher. Somebody you need help with? No, it ain't heavy stuff. What's up with you? Fine. I'm good. What happened here? Somebody was here, searching. Found anything? Don't know. What's with you? I'm fine. You know? Know what? Shaul, the mother fucker, was once a friend and now thinks he's a big shot. Got something on you? Hey bro, only the best. What is it? Where from? What do you mean, where from? I got my moves. Moves? What's the matter with you? Sit down, relax, I'll get you a great fix. You still friends with the stamps boy? Hell no. After what he'd done to Meir, I don't go anywhere near him, I wanna kill him. So where you got all this snow from? Hey, bro, I told you. I got into a fight with a pusher who sold to kids at school so I took it off him. He gave me this black eye. What's the matter with you? We come to visit, fix you up, and you give us this shit? Sorry. It's alright. What's with the Bible? You got religious on me? Not yet, I'm looking for something. What? Answers. You totally lost it, bro. Should I make us a fix? It all started 3 weeks ago, with Reuven's brother being popped in Prague. - Good evening, Francois, how are you? - Fine Good evening, Reuven, sorry about your brother. Thanks, Jackie. Everything OK, Francois? Yeah, fine. And you? Fine, thank God. Meir taking good care of you? Meir is great. Nobody hassles with me since he's been here. Business is good, I see. Blooming, thank God. Good, Jackie, good. Whatever you need, on the house. Thanks, Jackie. I'm going away in a few hours, it's time that our "friends" in Prague knew that there is a price for what they did. Francois, I need to do this. I understand, but the message has to come from me. No, you don't understand. I need you to do something for me. Shaul? Yes. You think he's ready? He reminds me of you 25 years ago. You'd have to guard him well, some will take it as a weakness. Don't worry, Francois, I'm here. What's up? Guarding him well? Give me a hug! Reuven. How are things? A few problems in Prague. I'm going there tonight. Will you be back for the Hapoel soccer game? No, I'm gonna stay there for a few months. I see. What do you say? About what? About you running things here until I'm back. We've just talked about it, you're ready. Don't worry, Shaul, I'm staying with you. OK. You'd have to earn your respect on the street. I know you can do it. I won't let you down, dad. I know. Barouch, it's Mickey, I'm at the station, waiting for you. What's going on? Francois is going away for a few months. So Reuven will finally be the boss? No. Shaul! Are you serious? Come on, get here. I have an idea. My brother Meir promised me that the minute I'm out, we are done with all this shit He said he was working on it. Haim. All good? Thank God, and you? Thank God. Swell. Good luck. Don't worry. I heard Eliyahu's coming out soon. In three week's time. Tell him if he has any problem he can come to me. Okay. Listen, Shaul, I've come to you because we go way back. I want out of our business... so if you want the docks, you have to pay. $50,000. The Russians will double it. But they're Russians. Listen, Shaul, you ain't a kid. If you want something, you need to pay for it. You don't have many options - You're either with me or with the Russians. Are you threatening me? God forbid. A man needs to know who his friends are. If there's one thing I learned from Meir, is that when your friends won't help you, stick with the highest bidder. So Meir went to the Russians. Everything OK, Meir? Thank God. Nothing like new beginnings. Vova's is bigger. What, Vova? I don't understand. Vova, get us a drink to... No, no... All in due time. Now is the time for business. Get the money. Next week the whole area is mine, right? As we agreed. Things with Shaul are OK? Put it in a private locker, please. THURSDAY Ellio, come down to the pitch. Get out of your place, you could do with some fresh air. Come on, I'm waiting. Here you go, bro, have some real food. What did you get us, burger? Why not? Only 19.90 Any chili sauce? Already there, bro. Have you eaten? I'm after grace. So, how was it inside? Like your burger. You're the man for not having snitched. Come on, the burglary was a mistake. Mistake or not, you proved you had balls. Balls, no balls, I got caught. After Shaul didn't give your brother Meir a good price, he sold his control of the docks to the Russians. Shaul got mad, knowing his old man will bust his chops for it, and what I hear of that night is that Shaul met your brother at Jackie's, and there was fireworks between them. I don't understand what's become of him. That fucker was like our brother, and look what's become of him 'cause of money? You don't want it? Yummy. Give me a light. Shaul, how are you? Thank God, Asi, and you? Will be OK, you know how it is. Got a problem? Ellio got out yesterday. So he's out. Rumor has it he'll come looking for you. He probably will. So what? Nothing, you know... Assi, you think too much. I don't like people who think too much. Assi, we each need to know our places. Why you look so sad? 'Cause I don't love me. Yeah, I know the feeling. Sorry if I make you sad. I... No, no, you're the best thing that's happened to me for a long time. Say, how long have you been there? Five months. Why don't you leave? Don't you know these people? They will never let me leave. Don't you worry, Shimi comes to your rescue. How exactly? They say I owe them 50,000. 50,000 dollars? Yes. I'll get it for you. You're sweet. How will you get it? Hello? Yes. Yes. I hear you. I'm home. At my place. No, you listen to me. If you want me in, I want half the money. That's right. Do what you like. But if you want me in, I want half the money, or I go to Ellio and tell him, and we're both fucked. Ellio, put the Bible down and come see what's going on here. He totally lost it. Look at this black cunt... What I would do to you, slut...! Ellio, Ellio, what's with you? What do you mean? I don't know, you're so heavy. What's with you, man? Don't misunderstand us, we're with you, you know that? Wanna talk? Let's talk. What? What do you mean? All good. Where you buying your snow now? What's the matter with you, bro? You're with us and taken care of. Shimon, slow down, where you buying? Gerbi, the guy from downtown. I was sure he's doing time... Look at the teats on this chick, you think they're real? They are six brothers, so who you're talking about? Boss, he wants a word with you. Everything OK? Mr. Arkadi, I've come to ask you for a week's extension... Assi, right? I rarely remember a name of.. Want a drink? Vova, get him a drink. Have a drink, feel at ease, you're among friends. M. Arkadi, you won't regret this, I promise. I'll get it all in a week, with interest. Thank you Mr. Arkadi, for being so considerate. You have 24 hours to come up with all the money, and that's only for Barouch. Thank you, Mr. Arkadi. Really. I sense they're starting to disrespect me. My money is gone, and if Assi doesn't get the money back by tomorrow, you get a message out on his flesh for all of Tel Aviv to know. OK. I stuck my gun in, took out my tool, and off to work. Yeah. Shaul, it's Haim What's up? Thank God, you hear? Yeah. What happened with Meir was arranged by Mickey. You think Mickey is smelling an opportunity here? Shaul, you've only just started, and your dad ain't here. Watch out for the sharks who've been here for a while. You ain't but a kid for them. Yeah, but I plan to grow up fast. After having conned my brother, Shaul was planning to take over the docks. After having conned my brother, Shaul was planning to take over the docks. That was his way of impressing his old man Leave Shaul to me. Show them all what he's made of. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Sure I'm sure. Who is Shaul? Just a kid, that bastard. OK. What's with the merchandise? It'll be alright. Don't worry. Gershon, I'm done. Have you got a grand for me? Assi, what's my name? Jackie. How many times have I told you to call me Jackie, not Gershon? Many times. Good night. Five hundred? Good night. Shaul, what a surprise. Sit down, don't just stand there. I heard the good news. Good luck. If you need anything, my door is always open for you So, what are you doing here? I came to visit you. Oh, well Albert, drinks all around, on the house. Jackie, how are things? Praised be the Lord. I recall at the Hapoel soccer games, I used to piggy-back you 'cause your view was blocked, remember? And stamps, too. He used to come to me for stamps. Remember the old stamps I gave you? I'm into hobbies. Once it was stamps, now it's golf. Why golf? Truth is Reuven wanted a baseball bat, Haim didn't like the idea. And I don't like quarrels, so I settled on golf. You know which club this is? Search me, how would I know? It's number seven. Seven is my lucky number! It seems today ain't your lucky day. Shaul! Shaul! Hush! Gershon, did you know a skilled golfer can hit a small ball, weighing just 150g, for more than 300 meters, with a number 7 club? Gershon, can you imagine what it would do to a kneecap? Shaul! Somebody wasted my brother, Somebody wasted my brother, and there's only one in this neighborhood who's capable of it. Have you thought about my offer? Ain't relevant. Meaning? I told you, the Russians doubled it. Face me when you're talking to me! Didn't bring your babysitter with you today? Cut the crap, Meir, ok? It's not good for either of us. I told you to face me when you're talking to me. He's got a gun! Gun! I'm gonna fuck you, scum, I've been waiting for this moment. I'm gonna fuck your ass. For old times' sake, Meir. I'm gonna fuck you, scumbag. Yes. It's Shimi, sorry to bother you so late, but I have important info on Ellio. He's in trouble in there, I need to speak with you. Well. It's not for the phone, man, I'll be waiting on the corner of Salameh and Herzel. Shimi, it better be important. What are you doing here? Where's Shimi? We came out for some fresh air. Can help you, Mickey? You can tell me where's the $100,000 you got from the Russians. Can't help you. They wasted Meir. When? A few hours ago, by the Georgian. Where's the money? Didn't have it on him. Take Misha and find my money. FRIDAY Jackie, what's up? It's Ellio. Eliyahu, Meir's brother. Yeah, I got out two days ago. I'm fine, how are you? You don't say! And now, can you walk? Sorry to hear that. Jackie, I know it's unpleasant, I'm calling you for a loan I need. Nothing much, a couple of grand. I'll pay you back in a week. No, don't worry about it, I understand. Feel better. Hello, may I speak with Meir? Who is this? A friend of his, I'm supposed to meet him later in the square about something. I don't get it. It don't matter, can you just put him on? Tell me who you are and he'll get back to you, he can't take it right now. What do you mean? He's dead! Hello, may I have the address for 03 - 6723749, 49! What's the street number? Hey, what's up? What's with the bandana? Nothing, just found it downstairs. Seen anybody you know downstairs? No, why? No reason. Jeez man, I'm fucking exhausted. Got a drink? Beers in the fridge. It's a horrible feeling to be suspecting everybody, not being able to trust even your best friend. I want you to keep an eye on Reuven as of tomorrow, sniff around. It'll get pretty risky if Shaul gets a whiff of it. I don't believe I let this fucking boy get to me. No sweat. If they ask, we have the money, and not a word about Meir. Sure thing. What's happening with Rinat? You did right never to get married. That's what I've always said. Just be cool and let me do the talking. Why did you bring me here? Baruch will go nuts if he knew. Your husband and his SS-man stick to Shaul like glue. So, you've become a babysitter all of a sudden? When you needed me and asked me nicely to help with Assi's debts, I did, didn't I? Don't drag Assi into this, he's a good kid. A good kid, but not the sharpest tool in the box. I'm asking you nicely to get Mickey and Barouch off Shaul's back. You don't get it. I don't have this kind of influence. Assi owes shit lot of money to many bad guys, you know what will happen to him without my protection? You're asking me for something I don't know how to do. You're a woman, ain't you? Figure something out. Look after Assi. Please. So far I watched your back, now it's your turn. What's so important? I'm gonna fuck Reuven. Well, if he's to your liking... I'm serious. Hear me? I'm gonna waste the bastard. What's happened? He's screwing Rinat. Where did you get this nonsense? I saw him pick her up and take her to a hotel on Diezengoff St. I'm glad you find it amusing. Listen to me, and listen well... You're not going to fuck this up. Francois has left the area for the taking, and it's ours. I don't give a shit about your fucking wife. Get off it, you hear? This is my business, is that clear? Barouch... Got your aggressions out? Yeah? We laughed? Had a good time? Now get a grip. Shut your mouth! Punching me? Me? Who saved your sorry ass? I'm willing to let this slide, but you have to understand how important this deal with the Russians is for us. Reuven will get what he deserves. And Barouch... watch your step, we don't want you hurt. After what he'd done to your brother, the son of a bitch does not deserve to breathe no more. You know, I see him in the cafe, eating, drinking, and having a good time, like nothing's happened. No shame at all. Son of a bitch. We were like brothers, all three of us, and lock what's he done, and for what? Don't let it worry you. How are the dogs? As usual, sniffing around. And the monkey? Barouch the mother fucker... What have you got with him? Nothing, nothing... he's a fucking psycho. Nothing ever changes in our old hood, does it? What can we do? Let's go to the post office. Barouch, get it! Rinat, Rinat, it's Assi, come on, answer it. Rinat, Rinat... What's up, sweetie, coming to lunch? I need a real big favor from you. Again? I owe five thousand dollars. What!? For when? For today! Who did you get in trouble with? Where am I going to get this kind of money today? Can't you do something? I really need the money. Assi, even if I could, it wouldn't be just like that. Tell me what it's about, maybe Barouch can help. Never mind, don't tell Barouch anything... I'll manage on my own. Assi, Assi, don't do anything foolish, I'll talk to... I don't get it Moshe? Don't they want to get the new edition out? I really don't know, Shaul, it's rather weird, I don't know what's holding them back this year. OK, got anything for me? Well, not really, but you know that when I see something, you know, something special, I put it aside for you, and. How many times have I told you, you're a guard, your place is out there. I just came in for a cup of coffee, I'm... got you. Well, don't make it five cups an hour, got it? OK, CK. Thanks! I'm sorry about that. It's OK. What's up? Hey, bro. Got the stuff? Sure thing I did. The very best, Just to your liking. As long as it doesn't irritate our face, right? No worries, bro, I also got us some toys, that look so real, like you'd never believe it. Is it still open, Ellio? Aren't you up to it? Sure I am. Our neighborhood has changed, hasn't it, Shimi? It's all the same shit. So, no one lend you some money? I went around to some guys this morning, they all have their stories. And Jackie? I called him. He said something about his legs. Haven't you heard? Heard what? Shaul. Jackie thought he could swing it on his own, so Shaul made him an example. And the Russians? The Russians like the Russians. They won't start a war until they're positive Shaul had screwed them up. What about Meir's money, have you found it? Sure I have. Really? That's why I'm going with you now, I want to make it a round sum of half a million, you idiot. If anybody deserves it, it's you. What's going on with the Russians? I think we're going to have some problems with them. Don't you worry, we don't bother them, and they don't bother us. The money we tried to skim from Meir, came from them. Fuck the Russians. We'll deal with them later, but for now let's find that fucking money. Back to the station? Let's swing by the Georgian first, see if any questions were asked. All units, all units, robbery going down at the post office on 27 Salameh. To the Georgian! But it's just around the corner. Let's take it and show the guys we work a little. Hands up everyone! Get on the floor! On the floor, now! You need a special request? Shaul... I didn't know it was you. You, all the money in the bag! Put all the money in the bag! Put your 'condom' on. Nobody move! Nobody move! Nobody move! Nobody move! Put your gun down! Put your gun down! The money! Get the fucking money! Come on! What a crazy gig, huh? Did you see Assi, that screw-up? And Shaul with his stamps. You think he's on to us? What? What a nice bundle. Afterwards... Arrange us a fix. How were the 'condoms'? Very nice on the skin. Told you, I bought the very best. We could use them again, maybe even twice again. What you doing? What you mean? Got another needle? No. I see. What's the matter with you, bro? You can trust us. Forget it. Have fun. There's 4700 shekels in here. I kept a grand, you take the rest. I want you to get me a gun, a 0.38 at least, unregistered. - Can you? - You bet you. Are you going to see to Shaul? I'm going to the synagogue tomorrow, this money is for a Maftir for my brother, God rest his soul. Great, Shaul will be there, he's there every Shabbat. Ellio, it'll be swell if you get him right after the service. It'll be alright, Shimon, no worries. I love the idea... of the Maftir. He sure deserves one from his brother, doesn't he? He sure does. Ellio! What's up? I was sure the next time I'd see you, you'd be out. Hanging in there? Three weeks to go. Here. Thanks. When's the Board? In two and a half weeks. Nothing to worry about, you've been a model prisoner. Come on, tell me about the place. Near the Dolphinarium, with a great view of the sea, I put out some tables and chairs there on the sand... How much? $100,000. How much? $100,000. You worried? I bring in $100,000 for the docks, you come for the opening of the best joint on the promenade. So we're gonna do it, ain't we? You bet you. Ain't it time we got out of all this shit? Straighten ourselves out. What? Knowing you, it's gonna have the best pussy selection in Tel-Aviv. Yeah, after you get there no one would want me any more. Can we give Shimi a job there? Anything you want. Meir! Yeah? Thank you. SATURDAY What? High as a kite this early in the morning? Morning, noon, evening... The more the better. You're dead! Get it out of my face. Why are you so heavy? Ellio, it's a swell of a gun clean, untraceable, just as you wanted it. Just do this son of a bitch, Shaul, after today's Maftir. Where did you get the gun? Told you, I have connections. I see, since I got in the slammer, you've become a big shot, well connected. Nice. Jeez, all them words. Come on, sit down and I'll fix us a needle. "May the One who brings peace to the universe bring peace to us and to all Israel and let us say Amen." Amen. Shabbat Shalom, dear congregation, we're now getting to the auctioning of the Maftir verses, and this Shabbat, it's a special Maftir, with special powers. Let's cut it short, and get on with it.

Congrats on your being out. What do you want? Just to talk. Go ahead. Not here, come with me. No need, Reuven. What are you trying to prove? Just the truth! You think you can buy forgiveness for fifteen hundred shekels? This is interesting, listen to what I've got to say. Your brother was not killed trying to get away. He got $100,000 from the Russians in return for control of the docks. And Mickey and Barouch needed this $100,000. What $100,000? How does Mickey come into all this? Mickey killed your brother. He wants to rule the neighborhood. Once your brother cleared the area for me, the hound smells opportunity, seizes the dope and sells it back to us. What are you talking about? You're holding a gun, so either use it or get it out of my face. Go ahead! You're so busy with the dirt out there, you don't see what's right at home, under your nose. What did I stand to gain from your brother's death? You and I go way back since we were kids. Shimi's been Mickey's pawn for years now, supplying him with all the dope. He set up the meet between your brother and Mickey. I'm waiting for you on the corner of Salameh and Herzel. The dope you've been shooting up all weekend, comes from Mickey. You're bullshitting me. Be sensible, where does he get all this dope from? This gun, is a Smith 81 Watson, a cops' piece, detectives. Now where can Shimi put his hand on such a gun? This is nothing, just found it downstairs. May I speak with Meir? He's dead. Son of a bitch. You're gonna go to Shaul? After what he'd done to your brother, the son of a bitch does not deserve to breathe. Bastard, I'll kill him. Take it easy. You've been taken for a ride, shit happens. I gotta go. Eliyahu, we can swing it our way. I'm listening. Mickey wanted you to pop me, right? I'm planning to stick around long after he's gone. I want you to get Shimi to meet with him at their usual place. I'll make Mickey pay for this, and for your brother. You do the same with Shimi. Deal. Thanks for the Maftir. What are you doing here? Where's Shimi? We came out for some fresh air. Can help you, Mickey? You can tell me where's the $100,000 you got from the Russians. Can't help you. What's up? Got something to drink? Didn't you have enough in the synagogue? Want a fix? What with Shaul? You didn't do it. What's with you? The mother fucker that popped your brother is getting laid now, and you're reading the Bible. I marked a passage that reminds me of you, here, read it. Get off, what do I want with the Bible, Read! "These are the words of the Lord God: Beat your hands together, stamp with your foot, "bemoan your vile abominations, people of Israel. Men will fall by sword, famine and pesti... "Pestilence". "..And Pestilence.. Well? I don't get it. Read on. "Far away they will die by pestilence; at home they will fall by the sword; any who survive or are spared, will die by famine" Read on! Leave me alone. Then I'll read. "And so at last my anger will be spent." Ezekiel 5:13. Let's play a little game, OK? What game? Who was the prophet Ezekiel, do you know? He was a great prophet. Have you lost your mind? He was the prophet of wrath, a prophet of reprimand, putting truth and lies face to face. Stop it, you maniac Enough! Enough! Enough! Prepare the fix. What's this? It ain't as good as Mickey's stuff, but it sure is something. So what? You know... So what of it? I'm not the only rat! Ellio, Ellio... I loved your brother Meir, honestly I'd... Shut up, you hear? Don't you dare mention him. Ellio, I never meant for your brother to be killed, you gotta believe me. I'm so sorry, Ellio, please forgive me, please! Call Mickey and set up a meet at eight, in your usual place. Ellio, Mickey is far too big for you to take on. Mickey has pushed it too far this time, but don't you worry, you'll still be doing business together, up there! Make the call! Hello? Investigations? I'd like to leave a message for Mickey, to meet his courier at the usual place, at eight o'clock tonight. Yeah, tell him it's important. Happy now? Don't do it, Ellio. Get the syringe out and fill it to the top. I didn't know they were going to kill your brother Meir, - I was desperate for a fix. - You're gonna get the fix of your life now. No veins. No veins? How come? You're making me nervous. I'm making you nervous? Get it out. What? Your dick, and shoot it up. It won't be a first either. Eight o'clock, Abu Hatzera alley. Eight o'clock, Abu Hatzera alley. Let me know how we've done. Sure thing, bye Reuven. My best friend. And my biggest fear that I'll end up like him. What do you want to do now? Let's pay Eliyahu a visit. What for? Scare him a little. Lock him up for the night Maybe he'll get a move on. You're mine now. We'll be spending some time together. Hey, Mickey, haven't you got something better to do than pick on me? The post office robbery, the gun... You're going inside. Don't call me Eliyahu! I think you should pay me a visit, I got some condoms there. Riddles, is it? You'll have plenty of time for riddles inside. You trying to scare me with this shit? It's a lot of shit this time, three years at the least. Misha, meet me downstairs, Arkadi is pissed-off. We're going to his place. And get me a Playstation 2. You don't know where to get it from? Stop by the Georgian, He must have something. Misha, don't bring the "Poet', got it? Misha, Misha? Faggot! What you're looking at? Nothing, just watching your blank face. Shut up and go stand outside so the men see you and come in. And you, get working. Fat Bastard. Slut! Mickey, this ain't what we talked about, I wanna know what's next. Take it easy, Barouch, it'll be alright. How alright? Relax! Shimi left a message, something big is coming up. What with Shimi? Swing by the usual place, meet him there. OK, and you? I'm going to Eliyahu's place, time for a closure. I'm going to Eliyahu's place, time for a closure. Assi owes shit lot of money to many bad guys, you know what will happen to him without my protection? THREE YEARS LATER THREE YEARS LATER "Ma'asiyahu Penitentiary" Eliyahu, how are you? Fine. Look at us, like two terrorists. Sorry about your father. Thanks. What's with the dog? It's your dog. Long time no see. Three years. So what do you say? Time we did business together, like in the old days? I got something I need to do first. Knowing you have somebody out there for you, caring, even if he's no longer around. What's up, Ellio, don't feel like talking to your older brother? Wow, keeping secrets, Ellio? - What's this? - A door I want out of the business. How much it's gonna cost? $100,000. Meir wanted different things for me, but this is me, and this is my calling. Meir wanted different things for me, but this is me, and this is my calling. So? As Meir always used to say, there's a time and a place for everything, and now it's time for business! MAFTIR A film by David Dazanashvili English: Iris Bat-Or
