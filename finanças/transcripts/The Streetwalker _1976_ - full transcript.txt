Thank you, Elie. Thank you. Elie, come here. Don't do that. You are both giver and gift. I promise never to betray you. And I promise you never to betray you. You've hurt yourself. I'll fix it. It's because of the thorns. It's alright. I'll put on a bandage to it. - Good morning, Feline. - Good morning. What rotten weather. Where did you get that? I've been knocking on the front door but nobody answered. Well, I know both of them are here, they are in their rooms. Just a second. - Hello, Elie. - Hello. You're really growing. Look at that, you are almost up to the ceiling. Mr. Antwan is here, he wants to talk to you. Thank you, Feline. Here I got something for you Elie. Just look at all of these. How's that huh? I brought you enough to last all year. How are you, Tony? How are you? Look at all the butterflies I have, daddy, they are red and white and they fly. I've had some new labels made up and I wanted your opinion. But I suppose I'd better begin. What's wrong? That's a bad cough. It's alright, I am just not very well. Feline, bring me a cup of very hot coffee with milk. Here look at my butterflies. They're not butterflies, they are labels. I want to play outside. No, you stay here. - Mom, please. - Okay, you may play on the lawn. Don't worry, I won't come to the swimming pool. This is uh... Monday... So in 10 days you'll be back and we can... It shouldn't take any longer. Good morning Sergine, don't come near to me I am a sick man. Oh you're exaggerating as usual. Tony is sick and asked me to step in for him and see some clients for the wine company. I'll be on the road about a week. So you are going to be a traveling salesman. Toulouse, Bordeaux, Agde... Paris. Frangelico, the Battle of... So you'll see all of those wonderful things without me. What do you mean you're coming to? No I'll stay with Elie. You don't measure Paris just by its paintings. There is much more to it than that. For me it's Saint-Denis, Boulon. Boulon, Boulon, where every pleasure awaits the stroller after dark. Where's Elie? Out on the lawn. That was really good coffee even better than usual. Thank you, sir. Want some fruit? I have some. Fruit is good for you. Darling, would you like some? No I'll have another coffee. I don't think you like your uncle, do you? Finest vineyards of Provas Antonin Pons Vineyard Company. He's a pain. Sergine. He always arrives at exactly the wrong moment. Be careful, daddy. You're going to Paris. - Now you be good, you hear. - Yeah. - Elie. - Goodbye. Be good. I'll write you in Paris. Send the letters care of the main post office. Bye bye, daddy. Do you hear the pussy go meow? Come with me. Get stuffed, you jerk. There is something I want to buy. But we're closed, its a little late. How much is this uh... How much is this telescope? 1000 francs. This is a real antique you know, it was made in 1824. It's so powerful, you can see things 3 miles away. She finally made a score. You get to Saint-Denis. You stop at the corner. You make sure there aren't any cops around, look in every direction. Now the coat, get it off. Show your body off. Come on... that's it. The leg... The other... Rest your foot on something. Pull in your gut, lift up your tits and breath. All right, so far so good. If a guy comes along, follow him. No no, with your eyes. Remember soliciting is illegal. I'll be the client. You watch me closely. Oh by the way.... Do you cum easily? - I don't cum. - Never? Never. Have you decided yet? Hey, you didn't pay for the drinks. How much? 150 francs. Did it go alright? Oh, yes, fine. You sure look good tonight, all dressed up with no place to go. You never know. - Listen, do you want to do a double? - Do what? The two of us make it with the same guy. Oh... Sure if you want too. What are you doing here? Same thing as you. How old are you? I'd say old enough. Are you jealous? Jealous of what... Peddle your way somewhere else. This is my spot. Rough night eh... A couple of specials. - 15 francs. - OK. - Let's go. - How much? 200 francs. Agreed. They look like two love birds. As if they have honeymoon that would befit George V. 50 francs. Plus the service charge. What's your name? Diana. My name is Diana. All right I'm ready. You're forgetting something. First the money. Counterfeit money. Give me some silver. Sure if you want. I'm not going to let you mess up my hairdo. It costs more than you are paying me. Want to go with me? - How much? - 200 francs. All right you got yourself a deal. It excites most men. It always um... - It's all there boss. - Let's have a look. There you are. I'll be back in a minute. Cigarette? I don't smoke. I suppose it is a bad habit smoking, but I just adore jumping on a pipe. I am very efficient, I adjust to every shape and size, the bigger the better. Yes we're a couple of fighters. - Going down sir? - Yes. I called the post office for you, sir, they are open late. You can go by and get your letter anytime this evening. Excuse me, young man, Viala. V-I-A-L-A. - There you are. - Much obliged. Sigimond Pons. 1 franc. Move on your keeping us waiting. Give him a chance to read the address. He can do it over there. Sender. Feline. She ran to the tower of the winds and climbed the spiral stair case. then jumped off. She died immediately. In paintings the people who are being killed are often shown smiling. But never the killers. See. Hey girls there's meat on the hook. - Get out of here. - Go on beat it. Bye. Goodbye. Contraceptive pills don't settle all the matters. Soap and towel are our best recommendations. A present for each of you. Thank you, is it silver? No, chrome plated but its better. And remember you never kiss a client. Remember. Let go of it. What are you doing? What are you doing? Give it back to me! - Don't push me around! - Don't push me! Stop it! Dam it! Stop it or you're all through here. So... so I'm broken again. You broke too. You planning on leaving here? No, where the hell would I go? Can you pay me back what you owe me. - That is the best I can do. - Thank you. Buy me a coffee. One black coffee. Make it two. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. A doll? Is it for me? For you. To eat? Yeah, to eat. Today I feel like being generous. It is Sunday morning. Open up. Open that door. Is that yours? Come on out. Take off your skirt. Take it off! Those are new, huh. Falling in love again. You are much to sentimental, my love. Pretty fancy. Who are they for? Who? I don't know. Ah, you don't know. You don't know. Now you know. Do you have a light? How much? - 200 francs. - Let's go. Oh yes, I think about my youth... when I look at old photographs, and I tell myself I'm looking in the mirror I play my old records, from a time when I was such a success at the Moulin Rouge. I used to come on to stage against a backdrop. With a red spot light focused right on my face... And I sang. What are you doing? You must be out of your mind, we want to hear her sing. Who does he think he is? What is he doing? Damn door. 500 francs bills. Good bye! Diana! It was a lovely sunny day... Elie went near the swimming pool. Maybe he wanted to get his beach ball. He fell into the deep water. He was dead when we pulled him out of the water. His mother didn't say anything She didn't cry. She ran to the tower of the winds, climbed the spiral stair case, and jumped off. She died immediately. The doctor and the police arrived... They said that there was nothing to say. I am so unhappy to be the bearer of such news... but there is no one else to do it. Your devoted, Feline. And yet I've never killed... never hurt anyone, never stolen or told many lies. I don't recall ever having harmed anybody. Looking for some action? You want the special honey? A blowjob I mean. No? I'm good at it. Oh, look at the face he's pulling. What's up? You parked here, didn't you? You want to play with yourself. But that will cost you. Go screw yourself! Twisted turd. He attacked me, the shit. Get out of here you bird dick. We should call the police. You stupid bastard, he really pissed me off. Who do these freaks think they are?
