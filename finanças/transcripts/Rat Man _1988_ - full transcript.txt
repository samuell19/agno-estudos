Esteemed Professor Carslake: As previously announced, I will present at the congress of genetics the hybrid I created introducing the semen of a rat in a monkey uterus He's got under his teeth a very powerful poison which causes a deadly leptospirosis and a scratch from his teeth kills a human in seconds When you are done eating I will dispose of you ugly beasts I'll kill you all!

Ah, Tonio Before the experiment don't forget to eliminate all remaining rats Yes, I know Well, it'll be better to hurry Promise me you will give food to him today. He prefers to eat only raw meat and nothing else Better that way. It is the right diet Ah, I was saying doctor, But this way wouldn't he become very strong? You don't have to be afraid of him.

Ok, I'll call you. - Why are you stopping? - We got a flat tire Then? I'm sorry, nothing to do, but must continue on foot - On foot?... - Yes. Are you joking? Why on foot? ... - Isn't it possible to change it? - This is the third time that happens ... and I don't have a spare tire Well .. And now, what do I do? - You're almost arriving, it's 100 meters away - Seriously? - Is it really safe? - Of course it is! Miss? ... - Won't you pay me? - Here keep the change ... - Thanks Is there anybody there? Isn't anyone home? Taxi! Taxi! I'm sorry ... I called the taxi. - Are you sure? - How sure? 100% Sure Since you can't waste time waiting another we can share this one - All right! But don't think you picked me up. - No way I'm Fred Williams I must return in the afternoon don't expect an adventure ... I don't have much luck today ... But where should we go? - At the morgue - Are you kidding me, or are you serious? - Yes, can you give me a cigarette? - With pleasure - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude! - Okay, forget it! It's about my sister ... Did someone kill her? FBI told they don't think it's murder Driver? - Where do we go? - At the morgue The corpse was devoured by mice unfortunately You must be strong, miss - But this is not my sister - No? Do you have any idea who it might be? My father will complain for your government, you scared us unnecessarily Excuse me, it was a hypothesis. A possibility But how did you come up with the idea she was my sister? She had no documents in her red purse, but it had sign with your sister initials. According to the American Embassy, there's one missing person and we wanted to check And the hotel? Have you already checked? No, the American Embassy informed us a little while ago, we had no time. I have the impression that this investigation it was conducted with great neglection. Well .. I'm sorry I renew my apologies, miss. But where is my sister Marilyn? Miss Marilyn left here with his friends? Yes! Three days ago - Where they went? - They went to the forest They wanted a photo shoot in the wild Thanks! - Then the girl is alive. - You deserve a promotion. Attention what you say. This guy is still out there because of you - Oh really? - My job is to find the killers, not the girls who venture into the jungle Mr. Williams, keep writing your crime novels for TV and don't mess with the police. Got it? Be sure of it. So, you are a writer of detective novels Not quite exactly Are you disappointed? No, why? If you were hoping I was an oilman you had no luck I got it by hurrying up quickly this matter Your father as a senator of the United States made it easier for you Since when... he saw that Marylin's picture in Playboy he was obsessed with the idea of stop her And now he keeps me at home afraid I go to a a place of pervisions like the Caribbean Instead ... I love the Caribbean. I always com here when I'm running out of ideas for my work in short, when my battery is low Is you empty of ideas right now? Not now! Because this morning I found it You found and inspiration? I found a good story The crime of that girl - Come with me, I'll show to you. - Where do you want to go? Come That poor thing she took refuge in the closet She hid because someone was after her. But she couldn't imagine That right here ... Someone was inside. Who would have attacked her? Were there two killers? One inside the closet and the other outside. Did they killed her together? Maybe nobody killed her! But give the numbers, have you seen the body and it sure is murder! She died of heart attack I read the autopsy in the morgue If it wasn't a animal poison, the only explanation is a shock She must have been attacked by a wild being, the same who made these marks here. An animal probably. Are you serious or are you making it up for your novel? Sometimes I like to interpret facts according my intution, but this time it may be as I say Lopes is a competent policeman, but is deprived of fantasy so he is inclined to find logic solutions. - What do you mean? Ok, see:a beautiful girl, elegant and sexy ... Walks in a place illuminated only by the light of a lamp A man see her, he's fascinated by the magical vision He decided to follow the girl. He wants to touch her, talk to her ... The girl is scared and takes refuge in the first house that's open Continue She is afraid and feel trapped, so she decieed to in that closet ...but... But? She did not know this house hides a horrible deadly secret ... She hear the footsteps, when... - Have you heard? - Yes! What will you do now? - I was so scared because your story... - It's nothing Listen! What did you hear? Footsteps There is someone! Let's hide, quick! He's checking the closet. He's looking for something Oh God! Come! - He is gone - Who was him? Someone with guilty conscience Let's go back to the Inspector. I want to talk to him. - About your story? - Well, it's a good start, no? The Inspector is leaving We have a few minutes. We will explain it right away, you'll see - If you say so - Hello! - I want to talk to you for a minute Always for the same reason. Something new? Where were you? It's two hours I was looking for you! Did you miss us? Can we talk in your office, Inspector? We found another girl's body - Looks like a foreigner - She too have no documents It's a one in one million chance - Please. - Why not? Something interesting to tell, Inspector. This isn't my sister! She is making a photo shoot in the jungle. She is alive, alive! Not dead as you think - I want to get out of here! - Excuse me, Inspector! Your behavior is is comprehensible It is not a way to help to find Marylin Fred? Tell me I decided to go check it out I can't stay here to wait I have to see her Did your father tell you? He is not calm if he does not see her I have to see her now. and tell father forgive her Good A twist to take the incredible turn Good! Lay down in the trunk. Great! Again! Very well! Let's go there! - Is the city very far? - Some 10 miles away. Let's hope we find a home first I'll search for a phone There is nobody! it seems a ghost village It's true. An abandoned city! I don't like it here Marc, let's go away. It looks eerie. Is anybody here? There is nobody here. It's useless, we are wasting! We have to wait Monique! Call her and let's go! Hurry up! Relax Marylin! There isn't reason to be nervous. You're right! But I I saw some blood! Everything is clean with a shower. And I should do it here In a ghost house? - I don't go inside. - And what's the harm, a shower is not hard to take Yes. Hey, where are you going? I'm going to call Monique We come back to the car and leave. Are you happy? - Yes, I don't want to be here alone - Yes, let's hurry. Monique? What is happening? Damn! What the hell is going on? Why Monique is screaming like this? Take her out? I can't open this damn door She stopped screaming. Let's go through the window! It's a labyrinth here. Our only hope is to be able to open his door. Wait for me here, I don't know what's inside - But I'm afraid. I'm going with you! - No It's safer if you stay here Monique! Marc! And Monique? No, it is better you do not see - What happened? - A horrible thing! A lake of blood! As if she was attacked from a beast - Marc, then the other body we saw, was also killed by a beast? - Maybe A wild animal is killing people What was it? Have you heard? It's still here Oh Marc, let's go, please, Marc! - What kind of person is your sister? - The black sheep of the family. From an early age she had a particular habit of getting into trouble She runaway from home to be a model, and the rest of history you already know. And you, how you are? What do you want to know about me? All. I am a writer I don't need to justify my curiosity it's a characteristic indispensable in my profession So I describe myself: I'm 29 years old and I live in Washington in a Georgian house along with the senator, who is my father. I deal with restoration and radical changes - I'm not engaged. - Radical changes of greatness. I'm almost done It's not serious but it is better to disinfect What a doctor is doing here? I'm actually a biochemist I deal with laboratory experiments American? Yes. But my family is from a small Swedish village I'm glad to be able to give you hospitality Here it is not common to meet compatriots The area is completely isolated After a few miles we saw your villa and stopped. Who you think killed the girl? I do not know. Monique was alone. I don't think it's murder. It's probably an attack by a ferocious animal In San Martin? - Do you know that village? - Yes. It was completely deserted. There people will have run away from fear I don't know anything about it. I don't listen often to the news. But if they abandoned the village, there was some reason. Don't believe? Maybe because that beast As soon you told me, I called the police. You and her must have only one worry: I must have her by now one concern: To get to town as soon as possible She is reticent about this Loks like there's a a secret that you want to hide You know the truth about all this, isn't that so? I know absolutely nothing, believe me all I know, I heard exclusively from her Relax. Don't get strange ideas Where is Marilyn? Is she sleeping? She's taking a shower. She's a pretty girl. I confess I don't see a girl like that since I have lived in this remote place You're very kind by offering us your hospitality. We don't want to bother you. No bother at all. It's a pleasure. I want to get my car and get out of here But I have to recover. I'm very tired. You don't have to feel embarrassed. I have a room for you both. Can I use the phone? Unfortunately the public telephone is not easily accessible, it is far from here and at this hour is impossible. Unfortunately mine is broken - There's something here - Where is it? Look, that door! Please, excuse me for a moment Tonio? What are you doing? He is wandering around the House We may can catch it Look around It's not the first time he escape Be careful not to get bitten I know what do with him - How many days to fix the car? - One week - Pay in cash? - No, by credit card Well, fill out this form, please Hello, rental car? What is your name? Fred Williams ... Yes, a photographer and two models, they rented a red car yesterday They went to the forest and hasn't returned yet Usually we call the police after two weeks One moment, please - You can go to the garage and get the car - Thank you Hello? Are you listening? What? No reason to alarm! Two days delay is normal Call me tomorrow night. Maybe they'll be back already. Marc! Marc! Help! Marc! Marc! Marc! Marc, something is moving in my room! Marc help me please, I can't stay here Oh my God! It was him! Turn on the light! Maybe it's hidden in here Someone turned off the power I want to know who killed Marc? I will explain everything as soon as possible! But now we must find a safe place immediately But tell me, who is this murderer? I don't have the time for explanations! Stay here and don't move, ok? - Did you see it? - No Look under the bed, courage, But don't go too close - Nothing - The closet! Let's check - Nothing - He isn't anywhere Go check the lab, I'll stay with the girl I'm sorry for the death of your friend A horrible death. At this point, you deserve an explanation No, there's nobody But they was here It's the only clue we have. Then we must continue to look. Sure! I don't see any other option. I started experimenting of bio-genetics thirty years ago. I was fascinated with the idea of creating a hybrid. A different creature that could be born from the crossing of two different animals Boston University was angry when I came here For more than ten years, there were a series of failures But two years ago I finally succeeded. I got a hybrid. The semen of a rat in a monkey's uterus, understand? A excepcional scientific result Worth the Nobel Prize from history of medicine But the being I created have a deadly poison Indeed... If it bites someone, it kills! Dead in few seconds and I'm the culprit. Those people died because of me He sowed death, because escaped from my control Why you hadn't informed police? You could have avoided the deaths For selfishness. I couldn't destroy so many years of research But you destroyed the human life. This doesn't count? I thought I could capture it without kill it. I couldn't imagine he would escape and become a murderer. I couldn't imagine it. He escaped from my hands But I can still capture him... It can kill another person. Let's make it a second choice. If we can capture him, without put anybody in danger - Kill him is too radical. - You still want to save him? As last hypostesis... If some have to die... I assume this reponsibility I implore, we must warn the police But won't be easy to capture him. He have a intelligence, superior of others animals. When we speak he understand. In two years he showed to have a outstanding capacity to learn He's almost human, understand? With the instinct of a rat and curiosity of a monkey With his powerful poison is very dangerous. You need someone who knows him to capture He can analysis the environment and may even set some traps Recognizes people and knows when have to hide Recognizes people he already saw He behaves as if knows to use tactics of intelligence If he finds a female monkey he can generate another creature and this one could generate another. All of them with this powerful poison. But with hiw own poison is possible to kill him I was doing a new experiment to find an serum for the poison. This way he will be a harmless creature. Then why kill him? Understand my choice? What would you do in my place? That farmer told this village is abandoned for years. I don't see why Marylin would come here. Why not? They were looking for a original place for a photo essay. Here would be perfect. - What were they looking for? - Something different of all. But I think I found the title of my romance: The Ghost Village What do you think? A story of mystery in a ghost village. Where an old murderer is hiding after commit his terrible crime A village with a disturbing history. A past with celebrations that involved human sacrifices The murderer is descendant of an old villager To avenge his ancestors he start killing But our murderer killed two girls Then he killed only one and the other the priest ordered to be human sacrifice - Have you heard? - What? A noise. Let's go back to the car - I can't hear anything - It must have been an animal, come on Marilyn is not here. Let's leave! Please! Come Just another minute. OK let's go! I hope I convinced you to make the right thing Ah! I forgot a important thing! Excuse me. Be back soon. Where are you going? I forgot my annotations. I can't leave it here. - Get them another time! Now enter in the car. - Stay calm, it will take only one minute. There's is no key. The key is with him The boy told he saw a red car going in this direction - We should see it soon - I heard there's a doctor living here In the house at the bottom of the park It must be around here. They probably stopped there. - And why? - I don't know... maybe some accident or something. - Maybe they're already back to the inn. - Do you think so? - Let's call the hotel. Certainly Marylin is in the bedroom sleepping and I'm getting worried now without reason Let's go to the doctor's house. If they're not there we will call the hotel. - You're right. - I'm sure soon we will see their car. There's the red car. I'm sure it's them. Let's knock the door. Is anyone there? I'm going to check If you feel there's danger go back to the car No, I'm staying here Oh my God! Do not look! Stay away! - Are you OK? - Is it like the others? Yes, attacked by a ferocious animal. Look at that hole! That hole is recent ... Stay here! Fred! What is it? - I heard a noise. -Where? - Here near me. It was a strange noise, like a breath of an animal It is closed from the inside Marilyn! Marilyn! I assure you we're making everything possible... to capture the murderer. We have a clue A crazy Indian escaped from a madhouse It is a matter of days, if not hours I could say we're catching him soon Anywhere in the world the police are the same Maybe you're right. But also homicides are same here or in New York In the end the police always catch them Here or in New York Yeah, but he may kill again. What are you doingto stop him? - We're doing out best - And the killer is doing it too! Fred, calm down! It's ok. Nobody can accuse us of inefficiency. Entire departament of homicide is in this case. But nobody is realizing that this manic do not act as a manic. Haven't you seen? There's no fetishism or rituals we still don't know what kind of weapon he uses to commit the crimes. Where you want to arrive with all this? I do not know. but there are many aspects on this story they don't add up You are a writer, and work with the imagination And I'm a cop. Facts is what matter to me. Yeah. Facts. I want to take the personal items of my sister found in the scene of the crime Of course. No answer, perhaps is off - Wait a moment - Ok May I help. - Take the bag and the victim's personal items - Yes, I'm going. - Here - Thanks And that from the young lady - It's your sister's stuff bag. - Thanks They didn't like when I doubt the efficiency of the Inspector I know very what to do with a policeman with a burocratic mentality as his. Fight with him won't bring Marilyn back. Forget about the Inspector. As you wish. Wait here I'll buy the newspaper - Ok! - Be back soon. - The foreign newspapers are there - Ok - How much? - 1 dollar and 50 - This one also! - 5 dollars - Here - I'll give you the change right away. - I want a postcard! - I'm coming! - Here you are! - Thank you very much! - Will you send the purse? - Yes, thanks! - All right? - Yes My bag. I brought you a book to read! After today how can I read it? You will like to read the news. - The ticket, please - Thank you
