I've got an ice cold compote too. It's so delicious. Here you go. Enjoy it. Cheers! I've been saving this cigar for years. I guess it was meant for you. Take it. Come on, put it your mouth. Let me light it. Wait, where are you going? I was gonna make coffee. Come on. Tell me where your boss hid the money. I don't know, I swear. I'm just a poor old guard. Beat us, not him! Tell me! Tell us where the money is! Please, my father is sick. Don't beat him. - Please don't beat my father. - Tell me where the money is! Where is it?! Please stop beating him! Tell me! You've come to your death, big guy. Let's shoot him so he doesn't tell on us. There. Stop, stop it! Will our noble lord summon up the courage? I'm gonna make sausages out of your horses one day. Our dear friend seems to be resting. Please, Timur. I beg you not to enter. Love is the only thing that can save this pathetic monster. No, I'm scared. I'll do this even if it costs me my life. Don't open the door even if I ask for help. Otherwise my efforts will be for naught. - But... - Please don't say a word, Madame. - Goodbye. - Come with me. You'll see better from afar. Get me out of here! Help! Are you deaf?! Don't you hear me? Get me out of here! He's coming for me! There's no way to run! I'm telling you to get me out of here! He's coming for me! I'm gonna be scared to death! Get me out quickly! Are you all deaf?! I need your help! Timur is shouting! He's calling for us he needs our help! Walk! Mommy! Get me out of here! God damn it, open the door! Where are you all?! He's coming for me! He's coming to get me open the door already! Open it! What's up, handsome? Good for... you. What woman can ever say no to you, huh? But you're not aware of your beauty. Why would anyone run away from you? It's their loss. If only you smiled a bit more... women would be lining up for you. What's up there in the sky? Hm? The moon. So envious of your grace... ...still beams upon your lovely face. Oh my dear baby. My baby boy. His mother's precious. Don't you cry. Don't cry. I'm gonna take you to the park. Everybody will love you. Everybody will see what a nice boy you are. Timur? - You like my dress? - Good evening! Meow, meow! Where's all the muscle we hired? Everybody must see you. They should applaud me for my work. Come here! You go, my lions! Start the beating! Not me! Stop it! Not him! Beat the guy over there! Esteemed guests! I want to talk about the most... important event of this century. Don't let him talk! Attack! They wouldn't understand Turkish. Tora! Tora! Tora! Tora! Tora! Tora, huh?! Tora! Don't be frightened. Please, don't be frightened. There's nothing to worry about. Don't be. Let's go. Come on. Get out of the way! Nothing to be scared about. You're safe. He's running away! Catch him! This is the dead guy the grandson kidnapped! Catch him! - Let go of him! - Don't let him get away! Come here! Get him! Wrap him up! How do you like that, huh? I told you to stop! Get the fuck out of my way! Stop! All my work... It was hunted like a wild animal. Timur, I'm not feeling so good. There's only one possible answer. If... I can fix the imbalance of the... curvature of his spinal cord... he'll be good as new. But how? How? How? How. We're wasting time. Wasting it all away. Timur, Timur my love. What I wouldn't do to ease... this great pain of yours. Achtung! Mr Timur, I've got urgent news! Mm, you taste like cotton candy! My beautiful. There's a telegram for you. I don't like to be disturbed when I'm working. Let's keep going sweetie. Your poor old man would have done... what you're doing through science. You're so cold hearted, Madame. What is it? Your fiance is on her way. She will be here any minute... since the telegram arrived late. What are you saying?! Wait here, I'll let them know. So beautiful! Watch where you're going! My love! My love! Are you surprised? Why wouldn't I?! Did you miss me? Come on, let's go to the bedroom! Don't you have manners? Don't get me wrong! I meant you must be tired. I wanted you to rest. Can you pay the driver? My love, huh? Are you surprised? Did you miss me? Come on, let's go to the bedroom! Did you drive the lady? Right, I guess you did. What's the damage? 20 liras?! You want 20 liras for such a short journey? What choice do I have. Here's your 20 liras. Keep the change. Aren't you the wise guy. Come. Come! Let's go to the bedroom. Come on. Here. Come. I'm coming my love! Don't mention anything to him. Did you meet my assistant Fatin? I did, sweetie. He's such a darling. Ah, finally! And this is my secretary Ayla. Your secretary Ayla. It's my pleasure to meet you. What do you do? I assist Mr Timur with his lab work. We were just discussing an important... subject at length, all alone. It's the Frankensteins who ruined this country! Crush them! Burn them! Whoa! Not me! Burn them! Damn to all those years I fed you with pastrami! Don't burn me! I'm burning you dimwits! You should go back to your room, sweetie. I'm gonna bathe you myself, my love. Like a white dove. You're making me blush, Tumor! It's not Tumor, it's Timur. Ti-mur! Tumor, nonsense. Get out! And here I was hoping I'd spend some time... with you in the same room. Shame on you. Are you trying to have me out of wedlock? But my love! - Shame on you! - Stop it. - Let go of me! - Listen to me! - I told you to let go of me! - Please, listen. That serves you well. You made me sweat. Were... were you wearing a suit? Stop looking at me like that, Timur. I can never trust you. Please be more patient. After the wedding... you'll have me without any hesitation. I'll be yours forever. Come on, my love. Hear me out. Come on. Good night! Got rid of him, finally. Look, he's coming back! Keep playing! He's coming back to the music! Are you sure about this? Of course. This is the only thing that can save him. I'm so scared, my love. Don't be, beautiful girl. My good and smart brain will combine with his. Two good people will emerge. Start the machines. 15 minutes. No more, no less. What happened to me? You've been asleep, sir. You rascals, you think you can out shrewd Mr Shrewd? Untie me! Attack! Attack! Attack the Frankensteins! Death to Frankensteins! Get these things off of me! It's been 15 minutes. Let's cut the power. Death to Frankensteins! Death to... Frankensteins! I'm untying! How are you feeling, my love? Here they are! Get that Frankenstein! Let go of me! Timur! Timur, my love. Let's die together! Don't stop! Slice them up! Slice them up like a pastrami! Why did you stop? Put your swords down! Who are you to order us?! You think we'd give up so easily? Listen to me. I'm a monster. A monster! I've killed 17 people. In so many ways. Tortured the lot of them! But now I feel fine. All thanks to this friend of mine. When he looked at me... he saw the good in me. He risked his life... giving me half his brain. I was evil before all of this. I wanted to kill everyone who looked at me... ...the wrong way or didn't love me. Not just kill but dismember them. I too love you, my dear brother. My darling boy. Come, come here. Give me a hug. - Feeling good? - Great, brother. How great it is to live. Kill all of them! I said kill them! - What a bad person. - Don't. There's no bad person in the world. That's what we're proving. Hit them where it hurts! Show no mercy! Long live Timur Frank! Long live Frankenstein! Come on, make a run for it! Run! See? They can do no evil anymore. Achtung! What's going on here? I think it's time to change the record, Madame. Time's up! Now we can end the movie. Best of luck, dear viewers. Good luck!
