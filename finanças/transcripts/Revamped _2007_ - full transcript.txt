RICHARD NARRATING: What a town. If they only knew was out there. I mean, what's really out there. I was there and I still don't believe it. Guess I should start at the beginning... the night of my first wedding anniversary. -Happy anniversary, darling. $12,326.18 for what? Continental Hotel? OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Continental Hotel. How may I direct your call? -Reservations, please. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): I'll transfer you. -Thank you. Continental Hotel, may I help you? -Yes, this is Richard Clarke. MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Yes, Mr. Clarke. How may I help you? - I got my credit card bill today and there's some charges to your hotel. MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): All right, and which night are you referring to? -What do you mean, which night? MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Well, you've been staying here quite a bit lately. In fact, Mrs. Clarke just made another reservation for tomorrow night. -Janet Clarke? MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Yes, sir. -This is her husband, Richard. MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Is there a problem, Mr. Clarke? -No. No. Listen, don't tell Mrs. Clarke that we talked. I'd hate to ruin her surprise. MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Of course, Mr. Clarke. And by the way, thank you again for that very generous tip last week. -You're welcome. MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): And happy anniversary. RICHARD NARRATING: My marriage was a lie. I was humiliated. How could I go on? So I got drunk. Tried to kill myself. That didn't work. -Damn. RICHARD NARRATING: Then I saw this infomercial on television. -Life got you down? Are you tired of your current existence? Are you at the end of your rope? Then become one of the undead, where immortality is waiting for you. It only takes a minute, just a little nip on the neck and you're through. Join our legions and you'll meet new and interesting people. And the nightlife is killer. Because of Kiss of Death, Inc., you're only a bite away from immortality. So pick up the phone and call 1-888-Bite Me That's 1-888-BiteMe. Our operators are standing by. Call now. - Yes, I'd like to join your legions. RICHARD NARRATING: So I called Kiss of Death, Incorporated. They said a service representative would appear tomorrow at midnight. This was the answer I was looking for. Cut that cheating bitch out of my will. Come back undead, get my revenge. -You're going to pay, Janet. You're both going to pay. -Hi. -Payback's a bitch. JANET (OFFSCREEN): Would you help me with my choker? -Sure. You come back later. I've got a little surprise for you. -What is it? -You'll see. -I should be home by 1-ish. -Perfect. -What was that for? - I just wanted you to know how much I love you. -Well, I love you, too. Duh. -Goodbye, Janet. -I'll see you later, honey. RICHARD NARRATING: Since I was going to become undead, I figured I could pick up a few pointers. -Forget it. RICHARD NARRATING: So I started to have some very serious second thoughts about this whole thing. -No! It's not very nice, is it? -Sorry. Sorry. - Aren't you going to invite me in? -Yeah. Yeah, come on in. RICHARD NARRATING: Her name was Lillith. -Nice place. RICHARD NARRATING: Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, after all. - I've got to tell you, you're not at all like what I expected. -What were you expecting? Some 6'2 guy with long hair and a goatee. -Kind of, yeah. -Oh, god. -You're very beautiful. -I think you're very handsome. And I'm real sorry to hear about your wife. -How do you know about my wife? -Well, word is she gets around. -Look, Richard. You're really much better off without her. You're much too good of a guy to be with someone like that. LILLITH NARRATING: Any woman would be lucky to have someone like you. - So, should we get down to business. -Oh yeah. Listen, um when I become undead, will I see you again? -Yes, if you want to. - I want to spend the rest of my life... well, you know. -Forever and ever. -Forever and ever. OK, let's do it. Be careful, I'm a bleeder. - I hope that it was as good for you as it was for me. RICHARD NARRATING: Everything was going according to plan. Janet's about to get what she deserves. Here's the part where she finds out I wrote her out of the will. - But he... he can't do this to me. -Wow, look at the time. I've got to run, Janet, or I'll be late for that board meeting. I'll call you later. -Jonathan! Don't leave me like this! How could you do this to me, you prick? - I'm sorry, Mrs. Clarke, but we have to move Mr. Clarke back to the mortuary for his final preparation. - Mr. Vincent, there's been a sudden change in the will of Richard's estate. There won't be enough money to cover the burial arrangements, as we had originally planned. -Oh. Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. We have a special this week on cremations. I'll put your original deposits towards that, and we'll call it even. - I'm sure Richard would have wanted it that way. - I didn't realize that by cutting her out of the will, I'd be shooting myself in the foot. My dreams of immortality were about to go right out the do window. -OK, Jimmy. Better fire up the over. Looks like we've got another live one. -Look out! Careful! They ought to revoke your license. You're a menace with that thing. - I'm not used to driving a stick. Are they here yet? -No, they're late. I don't know about this thing, Jimmy. -We go over this every time. We would be doing great business if it wasn't for that big earthquake last year that hurt my legs. - Yeah, and funerals with National snatching up all the stiffs. Nobody wants to do business with us, the little guy, anymore. - Look, this is the only way we can stay above ground. Here they come! - Greetings on behalf of exalted and most unholy master, Satan. -Howdy. -Let's get this over with. -This the best you could do? - It's getting harder to find guys to your specifications. - What do you do with them, anyway? -We're in a cult. What do you think? -Please! -It's nothing personal. -You know what? These guys aren't going anywhere. If we leave and come back, we can still catch the last half of the game. -Good. - Been a pleasure doing business with you gentlemen. -Oh my god! Shit! Bingo. -Oh hey, doc. If you're doing a brain operation, why don't you start with my wife? -Hi, Jonathan. -How do you know my name? Do I owe you money? I know you, don't I? -You should. You screwed my wife and then drank champagne at my funeral. -Richard. But you're dead. -Do I look dead to you? Where's Janet? - Janet, she left me for some internet geek from the Silicone Valley. She dumped me. -I'm sorry. Must have been hard for you. -Don't kill me. Oh, don't kill me. Whatever you want. -How about breakfast. MALE SPEAKER (ON TV): Are you being buried by the high cost of funeral arrangements? Then come to Coffin Stuffers where we discount death for you. We have a wide variety of funeral packages, from our no-frills funeral where you get a shovel and a shove, to our deluxe cadaver package, which includes coffin, flowers, and designer burial suit with two pair of pants. So don't get stiffed over the high cost of funeral arrangements, because at Coffin Stuffers, we're the last ones to let you down. Coffin Stuffers... we bury that cost along with the loss. -What is this world coming to? -Tell me. -Richard. How... -Kiss of Death, Incorporated. -I went to your funeral. Janet had you cremated. - Apparently she never bothered to pick up my ashes. I got reanimated at the morgue next to three dead bodies. - Guess that would explain the blood. - Actually, this is from something else. I need to find the vampire that originally bit me. -Oh, Richard. I mean, so much has happened in the last five years. -Five years. -You better sit down. Try to keep the blood off the leather. Because of Kiss of Death, the vampire epidemic went out of control. So the government formed a special unit of vampire hunters... Stake Force... to exterminate anything that went bump in the night. -So what happened? -There was a war. They all got wiped out. -Did any of them survive? - As far as the public is concerned, no. But there's still reports here and there. -This isn't what I wanted. -Richard, we all make mistakes. We just have to go on and live our lives. -That's easy for you to say. -Listen. There's an underground club in Hollywood. You talk to a guy named Boris. He's a good friend of mine. Very heavy into the occult. I think he can help you. -Thanks, Dan. I knew I could count on you. -Hey, what are friends for? -I'll be in touch. -Good luck, Richard. And Richard... you might want to change that shirt. -Where'd you come from? -I'm with them. -I don't think so. -I'm on the list. -There is no list. -Uh, I'm a friend of Boris? - Why didn't you say so in the first place? -Hey. What can I get you? -I'm looking for Boris. -He should be here by now. -Can I help you with something? -I'm good. -Let me know. -Hey man, what's up? -What's it to you? - Haven't seen you in here before. -You're hitting on me? -No. Man, I can hook you up. X, GHB, anything you need. I aim to please. -I'm not interested in that. I'm looking for a girl. -Dark hair, penetrating eyes. -Take your pick. -She was dancing over there. -That's -You know her? -Well yeah, everybody knows her. But very few people really know her, if you know what I mean. -I'd like to talk to her. -I'll tell you what. There's a private party downstairs, and I know for sure she's going to be there. I can get you in. It's to die for. -Let's go. -Come on. So, you're gonna love this. It's just down here, man. It's OK. He's with me. -Twins. -What the hell is this? -People, places, roll film. -It's video. -Whatever. Action! -Oh, I get it. -The need to feed! -Wow, looks real. -Just watch. - What the hell is wrong with you people?! -This is a snuff film. -You idiot. He's a vampire. -Where's the writer? -Ah, shit! -You're really good. It's a fucking bloodbath in there. -They said I'd be a star. -Better check your contract. This town will kill you. Sorry. -Hey, he's up here. He went out the back door. -There he is. Get him! -The sun's coming up. Get in if you want to live. -Do I have a choice? -You're dead! You hear me? -I guess I should thank you. -I'm Mary. -Richard. -Look, we're in a safe place. But for security reasons, I'm going to have to blindfold you. - I'm usually not into that sort of thing. -Just trust me. -I guess I'll have to. -Where are we? - Welcome to Hell House, formerly Hellman Correctional Facility. Now it's our home. -Cozy. -Mommy, mommy! Hi, Mister. I'm Lindsey. What's yours? -I'm Richard. What are you all doing here? -Tell him. We are like you. Vampires. -We're not vampires. -Technically, we are. Part human, part vampire. Half-breeds. - That's why they call me half pint. - About time you got here, Reeger. -Yeah. Where are the rest of my bodies? - They're already in the meat wagon. - Who is this new partner of mine? -Are you OK, Steve? -I'm fine, thank you. -He looks a little green to me. -Anybody want a bite? - Hey kid, if you want to work homicide, you've got to get used to this side of life. -This was in the camera. Man, talk about a reality show. Shit, what are these guys doing here? -Who are they? - VSI, Vampire Scene Investigation. Hey guys, thanks a lot, but we got this covered. Hey, I'm talking to you guys. -Hey, Reeger. They only take orders from me. -Linda. -Yes, sir? -Send in Peters and Reeger. -(SHOUTS) Peters! Reeger! Captain wants to see you in his office, now! -You wanted to see us, Cap? -Yeah. So how you guys doing? -Fine, sir. -Good. -Well, I'm not. I've got seven dead bodies. -Uh, sir, it looks a hemo. - That's sexual profiling, Peters. -Hemo as in hemoglobin, sir. -A vampire. -I don't give a damn what it is. I want it taken out. Now. You understand? -Yes, sir. -So what do we got? - We got some actual footage from the crime. -Jesus. So what do you think? - I didn't care much for the story, but the acting was good. - We don't need a smart ass, Reeger. We need results. - The good news is we know what our hemo looks like. I'll get an APP at him right away. -Wrong, junior. I'm in and you're out. Whenever there's a blood sucker involved, it becomes my case. -Our guess was right. This file is in the stakes jurisdiction. Anyway, Reeger, we got enough nutcases out there to keep you occupied. -But sir, this... -We're doing it, Reeger. That's all. -Amateurs. -They're damn good cops. Anyway, we're all in this together. -Of course we are, sir. My people are already on top of this. We've just got a lead on the vampire safe house and we're about to hit it. -Just do it quietly. I don't want the public to think there are vampires still running loose in these streets. - If you don't get it right, there will be hell to pay. And I'll make sure your ass is at the head of the line. -Hardcastle. Good. Assemble in 10. - So how did you guys wind up in this place? - Well, we had no place left to hide. We worked really hard to build a community here. -Well, you must be Richard. Word travels faster around here. I'm Celeste. And this is my little girl, Debbie. We certainly you're going to be staying. Been a long time since we had any fresh blood around here. -Celeste. -Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be inappropriate. -Mommy, can we go play, please? -Yeah, sure. Go ahead. -Excuse me, Celeste. We've got some important messages to discuss. -Oh, of course. -Nice meeting you. -I'll be seeing you, Richard. -I'm sorry about that. Celeste lost her husband during the epidemic. -What about Lindsey? Is her father a half-breed, too? -I don't know. Oh, Lindsey's not my biological child. I've actually never been with a man before. I adopted Lindsey after her parents were killed. -Sorry. - For years, we've been caught up in the war between a gang of bloodthirsty creatures, the bleeders, and the human assassins... The Stick Force. -Yeah. I already heard about the vampire hunters club. -There's more. -Can I ask you something? -Sure, Ken. -Why do you hate them? -Who? -Vampires. -Who doesn't? -I don't. I had a friend once who got bitten, and it turned out to be this thing where... -Oh, please. Don't tell me you're one of those liberals who think that vampires and human beings can co-exist. What else do I need to know about you? -I'm LDS. - Are you seeing someone for that? -Latter Day Saints. -Oh, what do you mean? You don't smoke and you don't drink and you never... - No man shall lay down with a woman unless they are bound by marriage. - You don't think I know what's going on here? Hmm? Sure, sure, I fell off the wagon after I lost my partner. And my wife left me after that hooker incident. - Which he was cleared of, by the way. Sorry. - So now Internal Affairs sends me some squeaky clean rookie who's got up my ass trying to keep me on the straight and narrow. - I don't know what you're talking about. -You don't, huh? Well, here's a news flash for you, kid. I don't care why they put you with me, understand? What I do care about is when I'm out there on the street and the shit's hitting the fan, I want to make sure that someone's watching my ass. - You don't have to worry about me. -Are you sure? -I'm sure. -Are you fucking sure, huh? -Please don't swear. -Brethren! The word has come from on high. Tonight we vanquish our foes. For the only good human is a dead human. Kill them all and let the dark lord sort them out. Tonight is ours. Tonight we draw for straws. - I cannot wait to dust me some bloodsuckers. -Fucking right. -I love to watch them bleed. -All right. Listen up. This is strictly a stake and bake operation. You know the drill. Rule number one... no survivors. Rule number two... no survivors. And rule number three... -Everyone comes home alive. -That's right. Do your final weapons check. We roll in 10. -Yes, sir! - Daddy, I thought you were coming to my birthday party. -I'm sorry, sweetie. Daddy has to work tonight. Put your mother on, please. -Is everything all right? -Hold on one second, babe. Sweetie, I've got to get back to work. -I love you. -I love you, too. -No, no. No! Baby! -Daddy, we're hungry. -No! -But Daddy, it's my birthday! -Let's roll. - There are a number of ways of becoming a vampire. Bitten on the neck then turned, or genetically. -That's what happened to me. - A few years ago, evil terrorists contaminated the plasma at some of the major blood banks. I working on a serum by the government while I was exposed. - They herded us into quarantine camps for vaccination, but we quickly discovered it was for extermination. -For being infected? - Well, since they had no cure, the government felt it be cheaper to just kill us than cure us. -A few of us managed to escape. - Like full vampires, we can only come out at night. But we're not immortal. -Do you still drink blood? -Yes, but not human blood. - I developed a variety of synthetic alternatives, including this. -What is it? -A blood patch. Similar to a nicotine patch, except if weans the user off blood. -How long does that take? -About 30 years. With our extended lifespan, it's not so long. Well, I have to go back to work. - So what were you doing at Club Sinister? -Looking for someone, something. What about you? -Looking for more lost souls. -You hit the jackpot. -I guess I did. -So how did you find me? - Well, when I saw you enter the club, for some reason you just looked more lost than most. -Thanks. -So how did you become a... - Vampire&amp;gt; Kiss of Death, Incorporated. -Why? -I thought it was what I wanted. Instead, I lost everything. -So did we. I mean, that's why we're all here. Helping each other survive. - I guess we're all in this together. -Yeah, I guess so. -Mary! I think I found it! -Get your bags! Get out! -Lindsey! -Mary, wait! Let's get out of here! -Let's go! -Hi! This is a clown. -Freeze! -It's cool, man. It's cool. -Hey, Bozo. I hate clowns. -Hey, cutie. -It's been awhile. I almost got you in Barstow. -I let you live that night. No more free passes for old time's sake. - You used to be one of the best on the team. -This time you. Just like old times. -Not tonight, bitch. -Don't play hard to get with me. -It's been fun. -Hey, asshole. -Huh? -You want some of this? Come on. Come on. -Time to die. -You first. -Not time. -Richard. -It's me! We've got to get out of here! -You think? Let's go. It's clear. I'll catch up to you guys. -Richard. -My god, it's you. -I thought you were dead. -Yeah, so did I. -Kill him. -No. -Why? -Because he's mine. -He's not one of us. - I turned him, and according to bleeder law, he belongs to me. -Orders were no survivors. -I decide his fate. -For now. Take him away. - You'd better watch your neck, my sister. - You may have turned him, but you don't forget who turned you. - Hey, since we're after vampires, is that why they call it a stake out? - Look, back at the station, I just needed to know you could handle yourself under pressure. -Forget it. - Yeah, that was a hell of a move, kid. -Thanks. - Looks like we're going to be here for awhile. - I'm glad I brought a good book to read. - Yeah, well you'll find that a good detective has to to be patient to solve a case. - We're not supposed to be on this case. -Thanks for reminding me. -Hello. -Reeger, it's Michaels. -Ah, what's up, Chief? -Look, Reeger. I know how you operate. I want to be sure you're still not working this case. -No, Chief. I just got out of my spinning class. - I'm telling you... you leave the dirty work to Hardcastle and his goon hunters, you understand? - Chief, I got you the first time, OK? Look, I got to get cleaned up for my internet date. -I mean it, Reeger. -Chief, I got to go. Bye. -He says, keep up the good work. -What took so long? Just because I am an immortal does not mean that I have all the time in the world. It all goes to preparations. -There was a problem. -What? - The Stake Force was already there. -How many casualties? -Too many. - I'm assuming that you secured the sacrifice? -She managed to escape. -But they had to protect her. - I believe that he is the chosen one, Master. -A vampire with a soul. Can it be? Can it be? -But it's only a legend. -Silence. And so, the prophecy unfolds exactly as I had foreseen. Where is he? Now. -We have him. -I need to know his intentions. -Let me have him. -No. I turned him. It is my duty, Master. -So it's your burden, Lillith. Bring him over to our side, but if you fail at this, then his blood must flow this very night. -Freeze, turkey. -Easy, Dirty Harry. -Sorry. What's happening? -Did Tom turn up, hey? Come on. -Hey, Stank. - I see you've got something for me? -Always do. -OK. I'm a little short this week, so just spot me, OK? - What do I look like, the Red Cross? -You look like an asshole. Fucking son of a bitch. -Fucking vampires. -Hey! -Dammit, Reeger! I could have ripped your throat out. - You couldn't rip a fart out of your ass. -No need to get personal. -Peters, meet Stank. Stank, meet Peters. - Why do they call you... oh, nevermind. - Stank is my snitch, aren't you, Stank? - I prefer the term purveyor of information. - So why don't you tell me about the murders at Club Sinister? -That was a real mess. -I know it was a mess. I was there cleaning it up. - Well, there's been lots of bloodshed lately. First, Club Sinister. Then your peeps hit the vamp sanctuary. Huh, you didn't know about that one? I guess you're out of the loop. Get to the point. -OK! OK, my sources tell me there's some deep supernatural shit about to hit the fan, OK. That's all I know. That's all I know. I swear. - All right, you've been a great help, Stank. I won't turn you over to the state this time. Just keep your facts clean. - Hey, you got a couple extra bucks for a pint of blood? -How much? -Oh, shit! You asshole! -What's next? -I don't know. We've got to go back to the station, work on some back up. No, we've got to get some weapons. We've got to check out that vampire safe house. -Wait a minute. - I know we're not supposed to be on this case, OK. But until we find out what's going on, it's you and me, kid. And we got to be ready. -For what? -The worst. - Vladimus sent me to speak with a prisoner. -Of course. -What's happening? I need some answers. - Richard, it's is very different world now. And the bleeders want to rule it. Our master Vladimus needs to know if you're with us or against us. -How can you be part of this? - We're all just trying to survive. -At whose expense? -We don't have much time. At dawn, the planets will align, creating a total eclipse of the sun. It only happens once every 1,000 years, and that's when our master will perform the ceremony. -To do what? -To blot out the sun. To make the world forever night. It's called Maltivore. -Vampire Armageddon. - And to complete the ceremony, a virgin must be sacrificed. - Good luck finding one of those in L.A. The attack. They were after Mary. -Yes. -So why haven't they killed me? - Vladimus needs you to be on our side. He believes that you're the chosen one. -Chosen for what? Midnight snack? - When you become a vampire, you lose your humanity. But you didn't. Somehow you still have your soul, and that's as unnatural as it gets, hence making a lot of very powerful demons nervous. -This is like a nightmare. I didn't ask for any of this. -Didn't you? You have to understand. I thought you were dead. -I was dead. Damn dead. You should know... You made me this way. -No, I mean dead dead. The kind of dead that you don't come back from. But you did. You came back. - I thought I'd never see you again. -Here I am. -Come to me. Now feed. Feed. Feed. -Was it good? -Absolutely. We're clear. -Come with me. -No. Lexa is my sister. She's the only family I have left. I have to try to convince her to come with me. It's OK. Everything will be fine. We'll be together again. -Forever and ever. -Forever and ever. -I'll be back with some help. -Hurry. -Somebody's in trouble. -You will pay for this. -Who's that? She's cute. -That's my daughter. -Oh. Well, I can see where she gets her good looks from. Where is she? -I lost her two years ago. -What do you mean? - She was killed in the vampire uprising. -Oh, Reeger. I'm sorry. -Don't be sorry. Let's just get this thing done. -Mary. Mary! -Freeze, turkey. -Don't try anything. These are silver-tipped bullets. -That only works on werewolves. -Oh. -Look out! -Back off! You're not going to kill me with the rest of your bloodsucking buddies, are you? -Wait a minute. I'm one of the good guys. -You expect me to believe that. -It's the truth. I'm here for reinforcements. -You ain't leftovers. I'll see you in hell. -Where's Mary? -We got separated. What happens now? -It's time to fight back. - I have been working on some weapons using ultraviolet light. - You have weapons and you haven't been using them? -We deplore violence. -It's a little late for that. The bleeders are up at the old Fairbanks mansion planning the end of the world. -What are you talking about? - They're about to perform some sort of a ceremony... Matador, Maltador, or... -Maltivore? -That's it. - Maltivore is the vampire word for black dawn. If it's true, we're all finished. - So what are you going to do about it? That's what I thought. Are you coming? -Hey, I'm coming. Wait a minute! -Hey, we'd better hurry up. The sun will be up soon. It's the best time to get them. -What about Lillith? -They're going to kill us all. - You're beginning to get the picture. -Celeste. - Oh, I'm so glad I found you two. -Where's Betty? -We barely got out alive. - What about Richard and the others? The sanctuary? -It's not safe anymore. But we have another place. Come on, hurry. I'll take you. Come on. Come on, hurry up. Here she is. A virgin, just like we agreed. -My kind of girl. -How could you betray us? -I had no choice. They took my Betty. - We made her an offer she couldn't refuse. - They promised to make me a full vampire. -Oh, yeah. About that. I forgot to mention one little thing. We don't take anyone over 30. -What is that? - This is a 16th century cross filled with holy water. - Where do you get something like that? -Ebay. - Are you sure these tunnels lead into the mansion? -Yeah. It was on the map to the stars' homes. - Maybe we should call for backup. -Already tried. -And? -Line's busy. -I really think we should wait. - You know what the professor said. Black dawn. Well, there's your dawn. We can't let them get to the blacking out part. Let's go. -You've had this coming. Very long time. -Richard is the chosen one. He will stop you. -I know he'll be back. I'm counting on it. -We'd better split up. You go that way, I go this way. - Are you sure this is a good idea? -Just stay in contact. Peters, I found a way in. Peters. Peters? Dammit. - Master, a fresh sample of the virgin's blood. -Master, The Book of the Dead. -Bring forth the virgin. -Get me the virgin! -Shit. -Our world begins! -Freeze. -Pathetic human. You think you can kill all of us? -I don't need to. Just him. -Protect the Master. - We're a little outnumbered here. -You're a pretty good detective. -Wrong party. -I told you I'd come back. - They were going to sacrifice me. -You should have got laid. -Where's Mary and Lindsey? -They're upstairs in the tower. -All right. We're on it. -You still have to get Vladimus. -Let's go. - Send these bastards back to hell! LINDSEY (OFFSCREEN): Help, help! Somebody help us! -It's the police! Watch your step. Step back away from the door! You're OK? -Yeah, I'm fine. -Dad? -Mary. I thought you were dead. -Mommy, who's this? - Um, honey... this is your grandfather. -They call me half pint. - Look, I hate interrupt this family reunion, but we're not out of the fire yet. -Yeah. You stay with them. I'll be right back. - Mommy, he's not wearing a shirt. -It's casual Friday. -Oh. - More than enough to buy a new army. -Just in case. -Going somewhere? - Lexa, you can still come with us. - There are predators and there are prey. And I'm a predator! - It's the end of this world, Richard. Join my world. -No. - Last chance to join the winning team. I'm tired of games, Richard.

Forever and ever. RICHARD NARRATING: So here I am at the crossroads of my afterlife I don't know what the future holds, but one thing's for sure... Lexa and some of the bleeders are still out there feeding. Someone has to stop them. I could use a job. - Man, I hope you brought some money. -Buy a girl a drink? -Sure, sweetheart. Whatever you'd like. - Looks like drinks are on the house, boys. - Hope you brought enough cash tonight, brother. Hold on. -Action. -Action. Sorry. -Hardcastle was right. This falls in the jurisdiction of stecks. Sex? Stecks. -Rule number two... no survivors. Rule number three... You've got to watch out. - I told you I'd come back for you.
