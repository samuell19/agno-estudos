''Dear Eberhard, warmest greetings to you all. l'm often with you in my thoughts. Though my health is good, my captors supply me with insufficent information about the events at hand. The kidnappers' aim, after their demands are rejected and l am liquidated, will only lead to more victims. From what l know about the planned Ponto kidnapping and my own case, this aim will be achieved. There is, as we've seen, no absolute protection against those working as carefully and effectively as the RAF. And the police wrongly believe that my kidnappers won't take any personal risks. They do not seek it, nor do they shun it. ln addition to Ponto and Schleyer, there will be more cases to come. One must soberly take stock, and consider all future kidnapping cases that will have a fatal outcome. Helmut Schmidt should know this, as should Helmut Kohl and Genscher. l am only one phase of this conflict, the winners of which, l feel, will not be the federal authorities. The people who the kidnappers want freed will only motivate them to take further action ...'' Merciful Father, into your hands we pass your servant, Hanns-Martin Schleyer, in the solemn hope that he be with Christ. We thank you for the goodness which you bestowed upon his earthly life, and for the goodness which we experienced through him. ''Our country's leaders cannot always drive in armored cars. Hence they will always be vulnerable. Go to Bonn and Cologne, and perhaps speak to Mr. von B. and Kurt H. about these matters. My kidnappers know of this letter, but it was of my own doing, and came about during the last night. This front will not cool down soon. But an escalation can be prevented once the primary goal is achieved, and hopefully not after 10 attacks. l will certainly keep my composure. Do stay healthy and optimistic. l hope to see you soon. Your Dad.'' ''Once a certain level of atrocity has been reached, it's irrelevant who is responsible. lt simply has to stop.'' April 8, 1945. Mrs. Wilde, 5 children GERMANY lN AUTUMN lt's me, Fassbinder. lt's about the interview we did this afternoon, about ... that last part. l ... l don't know if l was hysterical, but l ... Can we omit that part, or something? Okay. What's done is done. Okay, thanks. l think that ... ... marriage is a form of cohabitation, which ... is artificial to start out with. Regardless of how much ... if you're brought up as we are, of how much you may need it, l think marriage is artificial. And l make .... As to marriage, l can definitely say that one of my goals in making films is that people who are married, whose marriage might be on the rocks, who see my films about marriage, that they might start to deal with their marriage in concrete ways. And in my opinion, it's much more positive, for example, if a marriage like that really goes to pieces, or if my films help break up such a marriage, than if marriage as an institution is preserved without question or examination. lt's that simple. Armin! Armin! - Yeah? - Are you sleeping again? Hi. - Make some coffee. - Yeah. Where's the telephone? - Over there. Why are you back so soon? l thought you were coming tomorrow. Why? l told you l was coming back today to do the mixing. l would've rather stayed in Paris. You don't listen. Did you hear anything? - About what? About the airplane. - What airplane? My God, Armin, the hijacked airplane! No, l didn't hear anything. Did you even listen to the news? - No. Yeah, it's me. l just got in. Anything new? No, Armin said there was nothing new on this end. Nothing more than what they said on the news and what's in the papers ... about that GSG-9 special unit, or something. l just can't imagine that they'd storm the plane. l just can't imagine that. You know what l think? l'd blow up the whole plane! Armin wants to blow up the whole plane. You know him. All for a few passengers! - 86 of them, no less. - That'd do it. Now they have to promise to make every guest-worker a millionaire. That's different! - Get me my coffee! Okay. Are things are fine otherwise? l'll call you when l hear something. Yeah. Bye, darling. And the others that are in jail, should they be shot or hanged? You're actually serious, aren't you? You'd shoot or hang every single one, wouldn't you? - Yeah. And who'll you get to do that? - The state. The state? The police, or what? - Yeah. Okay, and who gives them that right? lf they don't follow the law, the state doesn't have to either. Now just hold on a second. You really mean ... if someone does something wrong ... Yeah. - The other person can justify doing a greater wrong. Especially if he's in power, like the state, eh? - Yeah. Okay, then l say this is my apartment and you're going to leave. No, it's just as much mine. - lt's my apartment! Okay, okay, okay ... And now get out. Get out, l said! - Then l'll get out. l'm leaving. Armin! So there'd be no discussion? - No discussion. You think that's okay? l wouldn't encourage anyone to talk in the current situation. l would be terribly alarmed if someone, in a public discussion, expressed themselves in the way that Jung did yesterday, in the ... in that discussion. He pointed out that criticism is justified, and that if criticism is quelled, and ... such demands are made, like what's happening with the terrorists ... l'd just be scared to hear someone say that. Why? Because l don't know what someone else would do with it. You see? An acquaintance of mine really badmouthed Boll once. lt was before Schleyer was kidnapped. When l defended Boll, he said, ''You're one of those sympathizers!'' Understand? You just don't know, in the current situation of hysteria, how something you say can be used against you. And that's why l think l wouldn't encourage anyone to talk. For my part, l can't understand that, because ... Well, it really reminds me of the Nazi period, when people just kept quiet in order to stay out of trouble. Armin? Armin! Give me lngrid's number in Paris. - Yeah, sure. lngrid? Hold on. Hey, it's me. Get me a schnapps, Armin. All l get is grief. What time it is? l don't know, around 10. They're dead. Baader, Ensslin and Raspe. They killed themselves in their jail cells. Yeah. She hung herself, and Baader and Raspe shot themselves. Thanks. l don't know, they had a gun and shot themselves. Nobody knows how the weapons got in there. Yeah, an international commission is going to investigate whether or not it was suicide. What l may or may not think is completely irrelevant. lt's the most secure prison in the world. People are prohibited by law from entering those cells. The cells are thoroughly searched twice a day. The fact they had real guns in there is just unbelievable. No, no. No idea. No, no. l have to stay here. l'm not finished yet. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Bye. What has to happen these days before you'll talk again? Well, the people that have authority, and those ... who have the relevant influence, they ... have to use that influence. And who, may l ask, has influence and authority? People like Mitscherlich, for example, or Jung, or Boll, for God's sake, with his international reputation ... You just said you had a problem with someone because of him! People here have to grasp the fact that ... Here and now ... ln essence, it's ... The masses don't make a democracy. They haven't grasped what it is. They think that if you criticize the state, you're already, what do l know ... But you support that by saying you wouldn't encourage open discussion right now. Well, l want it to happen through the media, for example. Nonsense. They'd do a manhunt. Everyone knows that. But now they provide phone numbers, a different one for each city, for anonymous phone calls. What's that all about? That just encourages people to denounce each other. lt's nothing less than a call for denunciation! You don't really think that this will change! You don't seriously think they'll revoke it, or anything! lt'll stay! lt's just what they want! Yeah, listen if you want! Yeah, Armin's listening. Pour me one too. Yes ... No, l can't leave. l can't leave right now. l don't know why either. l ... l'd like to, but l ... l'm scared too. l feel like l can't carry on. lt's alright. Alright. Fine. Bye ... bye. l go shopping, and you don't eat. - l'm sorry, Armin. lt's always the same! - l'm sorry! What is it this time? Nothing. Then come on over and eat. What shall we do with our big boy? What are you looking at? l'm not looking at anything. Anita? lt's me. No, me ... yeah. You got anything on you? Okay. Send it over. About three, okay? By taxi. Okay. Thanks. l thought you'd quit that stuff. - Well, l thought so too. Yeah, l'm depressed! l can't go on! l can't work anymore! And Siggi is proof that it helps. Now l understand what they mean. Why do you want to delegate your concerns to the system of freedom that you believe in? Well, l delegated them when l voted. Besides, there are political parties, and l assume that in those parties, one of which l voted for, that reason will prevail. That's what l assume. - So reason must come from above? The reas... Your understanding of democracy ought to be, especially if you experienced the Third Reich, as you in fact did ... Then you ought to say, ''The rank and file individuals ...'' l want to tell you that l ... have considerable difficulties, because l do understand that there is good reason to be upset about many things that are happening, and that criticism is necessary. You said you wouldn't even advise people to talk! Not at the moment, no. - That's a rejection of democracy! When the pilot was shot in Mogadishu, or in Aden, you said that for every person shot, you'd like to see one terrorist shot in Stammheim Prison. Yes. Publicly. - Publicly? - Yes. And that's democratic? - No, it's not. But hijacking the airplane wasn't democratic either. Or saying, ''Now we'll shoot one person after another.'' lf it had been you or me in there, what would you have thought? That changes everything. You have to consider that. So it's 'an eye for an eye'? - No, not 'an eye for an eye'. But in a situation like that, you can't just respond with democracy. 800 ... 43 ... l think that's right. Franz ... now in a semi close-up ... Seen through the door, he appears to be very lonely. He turns ... Armin? - Yeah. Armin? - Yeah, what is it? Where's the grass? There. Have you gone mad? Are you mad? What are you doing? - The police are at the door. So what? - Armin, the police are at the door! Now l really don't understand. They're coming upstairs. - Have you gone nuts? What if they'd come in? - Then they would've come in! Sure. One wrong move by either of us, and they would've opened fire. They wouldn't do that. - What about the cases when they did? lf people got shot, it was their own fault. You know what you are? You're a measly little shit! Then that's what l am. Then l'm going to get drunk. You just said you don't care about laws, yet you're a democrat! l do care about laws ... - You just said you didn't. But if people who ... - No 'buts'! You say you don't care. Regardless of the situation. And you're a democrat! But if people like that ... - No! Answer me, please! They break the law, not me. - Yes, so does a normal murderer! Then the terrorists are murderers? - Sure they are, for all l care! But there aren't any special laws for murderers! Yes, but you can catch them, and then you have them under arrest. And they can't cause such trouble. - No? No. - No? lt's not just that a normal murderer has bad reasons, or none at all, for committing a murder. lsn't the bad thing about terrorists that they have reasons that you can understand? - But the means are wrong, Rainer. But you don't care about laws either. You said laws are irrelevant, when it comes down to it. - l was so outraged ... ls it permissible to have a situation where you don't care who makes the laws, or what they are? ''As you know, we picked up the Jews. We went into the courtyards and sang 'The Sentry on the Rhein', that's how woozy l was. Then the two Jews took me aside and told me stories. Words are good too, Gottlieb, and the things people say.'' Armin! Armin! ls that you? Yes. Why are you shouting? Where have you been? l went to a few bars, then l met a guy who needed a place to sleep, so l brought him home. You did what? What's he look like? Look for yourself. He's asleep. Why don't you look? - Where's he from? l'm not sure. Hamburg, l think. - That's all you know? - Yeah. Go ahead. Go on, look at him. Throw him out. - Why? - Because l said so. What's he supposed to do? - l said throw him out, so do it! Hey, get up! Come on, get up. But why? - Go on. You have to leave. Alright, l'll leave. Now what did you do that for? And democracy is the most humane form of government, is it not? - lt's the lesser of all evils, right? The lesser of all evils? - Yes, right now it is an evil. Democracy? - Yes. - Would authoritarianism be better? No. Here and now ... What would be better? lf it's the lesser evil, there must be ... some kind of good. What would that be? The best thing would be a kind of authoritarian ruler who is benevolent, and kind and orderly. Gabi Teichert, history teacher. Since autumn 1977 she's had doubts as to what to teach.

The media are present. lf we give each other the blame for terrorism, we won't ... we won't get very far, we won't reach our objective. This rock is simply too big. All of us welcome the democratic struggle, the struggle of opinions and of arguments. While those people who lend intellectual or material support to the terrorists have not even comprehended what a democratic order means, those people who insist upon human dignity, even for terrorists, are democratic through and through. And then there is the large and respectable group of those who are critical of state and society. We cannot improve this country if we are not aware of its flaws. Dear Mrs. Schleyer, dear sons, dear family members gathered here, Mr. President, honorable guests ... Meanwhile, in the New Palace, the reception is being prepared. People, quiet down! My goodness, same old story. Okay, here we go! As always, smile! Be polite, be quick. Remember, this has to be quick. Please hold the trays properly, at chest level, okay? And off you go! How many guests had you expected? - We'd expected around 1100 guests, but with such events, you never know. ln the end, between 450 and 550 guests showed up. What was the event? - The event was the funeral of Mr. Martin Schleyer. We have to cater to such sad occasions as well. Are such state receptions common? - There are often such receptions, but not under these circumstances. What will become of our dreams? What will become of our dreams ln this divided country?

Horst Mahler is suspected of being a founding member of the RAF. He was one of the inmates to be exchanged for Lorenz, head of Berlin's Christian Democrats. He refused. Franziska Busch works in a political group. ln private, she belongs to a renowned TVdirector. She's already read 7 of Mahler's works. She expects clarification. We're making a film about the political climate in West Germany after the Schleyer kidnapping. You once said that this event represents a deep incision in the political life of West Germany. What do you mean by that? l see it in the context of the events of 1945, to name just one year. Then there's 1967, and now 1978, '77 and '78, all points of incision. lnitially, 1945 marked only the crippling of the political power of German fascism. The ideology was broken only in part. But there was no anti-fascist revolution in Germany. To a certain extent, this was finally rectified by the 1967 student revolts. Not until then did we become truly aware of what fascism is, and particularly of the fact that the social roots of fascism continued to exist. Continued to exist in West Germany, but also in other countries, especially the United States. ln 1967, the desisive moment was the protest movement against the Vietnam War. Then, in 1968/69, there was the obvious decline, you could say collapse, of the student movement. lt broke up into numerous bickering and feuding factions. Each one flew their own flag. The majority of the population showed no solidarity whatsoever, an experience that nobody had made before, and that nobody assumed would have to be made. lt was something that nobody understood or could understand. That was our fault. lt wasn't propaganda or dumbing down, as is often claimed. We weren't, our consiousness wasn't, keeping up with the times. And at the time, we ... felt that it had to move forward. And we saw that we'd come up against certain limitations that seemingly could not be overcome. And so, in our heads it became the notion that the whole thing, as is so often the case, failed once again due to a barrier of power. Not because of our shortcomings, or lack of awareness on our part, but due to objective conditions of power. - Which it was as well ... lt was, but one has to ask why this particular society, which we criticized thoroughly, whose decay we had diagnosed decades ago ... Why is this society still able to react to act to us with such resolve and force? Of course, it was all more or less abstract, removed from the existing social context, and in particular, removed from the mentality of the people, who were not in any way ready to wage war against the state, or to support a war against that state. At the time we weren't aware of this, otherwise we would never have put this policy, if you can call it that, into effect on a practical level. The development that came about, leading up to the Schleyer kidnapping, and, this is really the crux of the problem, leading up to Mogadishu ... That created the conditions to bring the crisis ... l see it as a crisis of the Left, of our left-wing thinking, ... it finally came to our attention as a crisis, as a weakness of ours, an object of our critique. l think you can't imagaine it as a more radical culmination, than this opposition that we initiated with our protest, that we began with our uprising against imperialism ... The fact that we took to the streets because of My Lai, for example, a massacre against the Vietnamese people. And now we have to watch as one group of this movement, in order to free prisoners with which the general population does not in any way identify, takes innocent and defenseless civilians, women, children, old people, takes them hostage, and threatens their lives, threatens to massacre them, apparently without ever having asked the question: Does this in any way have anything to do with left-wing politics? The question is, how can a person like Ulrike Meinhof kill another person, or find his death acceptable? A criminal murderer removes himself from the system of moral values. A revolutionary carries it too far. This means that the moral rigorism of the revolutionary, which can spiral into a subjectively... presumptuous arrogance, is at the same time the prerequisite for overcoming the scruples that one has as a left-winger, when it comes to killing a person. You see the moral corruption of the capitalist system, you see the people in this system acting in a corrupt way, and you judge them morally, you condemn them. And based on that moral judgement, you consider them the embodiment of evil. Thus, you have the idea that personal guilt plays a role, and that it is necessary and just, for the sake of liberation, to eradicate this evil, including where it is personified. This means eradicating people. This is why there's so much talk about sympathy for terrorists. There exists a common starting point, and that is the moral indignation about the current state of society, the disgust at the fact that we had fascism, state-sponsored fascist murder, the fascist extermination of other peoples, and that all this had social causes which continue to exist today. And that so little of the moral outrage could be translated into political action in this population, in this country. That today people like Dregger and Straub can, through their apparent support of the Chilean junta, justify, in retrospect, this country's Nazi fascism. For what Straub said in Chile is nothing short of saying that fascism, if it's necessary to preserve a social system, meaning the system of profit, is sometimes an inevitable evil. ln other words, it's a good thing. Munich, Saturday, October 15, 1977 Late Afternoon May l come in? May l? My God, look at you! kurt Hartung, Dentist May l sit down? - Please, make yourself at home. Who are you? What do you want? l had an accident. l'm sorry. l crashed my car. Out in front of the building. - ln front of the building? l thought l'd seen you before. Shouldn't you see a doctor? - No doctors. Can l have a glass of water? Perhaps you'd rather have a schnapps? - No schnapps. Just water. This'll do you good. You were in Spain? - Hm? Please wipe off the blood. Do you have any iodine? ln the bathroom, top cabinet. l can't bear seeing blood, either. Are you a pianist? You could say so. So ... Over there, your guitar's ready. Roll sound! Wolf Biermann, ''Girl in Stuttgart'' ''l ran into a girl, and it really hurt. The tears streamed down her face. She screamed, 'Yeah right! Yeah right! No way was it suicide! ln Filbinger's mega-jail, don't take me for a ride. Just like Ulrike, yeah right. They twist it to fit their tale. Baader, Ensslin, Raspe ... The alchemists of the revolution. l think that both are true: They drove themselves and were driven to that point. Desperate by their own means, made desperate by us, and they took that final dark step, the three of them, all on their own. And yet ... lf the desperate girl were right, and if the truth were to come out, namely that the suicide was not really suicide ... Hey, don't kid yourself, too many here would approve. Their beer would taste all the better. They'd be so proud, just like they are of our GSG-9 boys. But that wouldn't be all. ln this beautiful country of ours, the number of those killed by their own hand would increase even more. Where should the tears go? What about her, what about the girl? And what about this flourishing land in crisis? Soon l think l'll see her photo. lt will be in a row with other photos. ln the window of the bakery. And a hand, armed with a pen, will, with a scribble, cross out her human face.'' The political group that Franziska Busch belongs to is producing a film that is reminiscent in form of the revolutionary films of the '20s. Now hold it out there. Straight out. Look this way! Good.

Gentlemen, so far we've carried out the operation according to plan, despite the loss of the 4th Ranger Brigade. The acceleration of the delay by perhaps three hours will not throw off our primary schedule. l hope that 34 ... let me emphasize this, it's crucial: All measures are subordinate to getting 34 ready for action by the break of dawn. ls that clear, Burmeister? And the entire logistics battalion, Mr. G-1, tell this to G-4, is running around without camouflage on their helmets. Call me petty, but if it's an order, then you wear the beast. And the gentlemen of the dispatch battalion here at the command post have no camouflage netting on their helmets. Why do l give orders if they're not obeyed? lt's the dispatch unit over by the helicopter landing pad. Hanns-Martin Schleyer, Friday/Saturday, September 9th/10th, 1977, to von Brauchitsch: ''lf Bonn refuses, then they should do it soon.

As l said, their speaking, writing, their exchange of opinions, signals, etc., must be prevented at all costs. And that was possible. Haven't we seen this all before? And then the other nuisance, at the universities, the ''young Left''. Mainly ...

Did Creon not grant one brother of ours funeral rites, but refuse the other? Eteocles he took into the earth, according to custom, they say, so gracing him among the dead below. But Poynices' dishonored corpse may not be mourned, may not be buried. So it was proclaimed: Without lament and without burial, he shall be left to the birds, who lurk already to gorge themselves. Noble Creon passed down such an edict. To you and me. Yes, to me as well. And he does not jest. What boldness do you contemplate? Lend me a hand to bury the dead with me. You will bury him, despite the interdict? Yes. He is my brother... and yours too, though you fail him. l will not betray him. lmpudent one! Creon forbade it! He may not keep me from my own. - We must accept that we women are not meant to compete with men. We are ruled by the strong. He can impose worse than only this. So l plead pardon from those below, for l am ruled by force. l obey the powers that be. There is no sense in reckless action. l'll not ask you again. And even if you were willing, l would not accept your help. Keep your actions secret, at least. Let no one know, and l too will keep it secret. No! Proclaim it loudly to all! Your silence makes me hate you more. Your heart seethes hotly with your dreadful works! l will not give up until my strength gives out. lmpossible! Can a human heart ... l can't stand it. l'll wait outside. - Should l join you? Remember the costumes. Eteocles, who fought for his Fatherland and fell as a hero ... Lower him into his grave with all the ceremonies that we grant the greatest of our dead. His brother Polynices, on the other hand, who was exiled and yet returned, who wanted to burn his fathers' city and his idols, who desired to murder and enslave his own people ... He will receive, as l ordained, no burial, and no mourning ceremony. His corpse shall remain unburied. Prey ... for dogs and birds. A ghastly sight. This is my will. Do you want a coffee too? - No, thanks. That's the culprit, caught while burying him. But where's Creon? - What have l chanced upon? She was burying him. That's all. - Did you know it was forbidden? l did indeed know. That was clear. And yet you dared to break my law! The disclaimer text at the start is not clear enough. lt's too classical. lt must be clearer, with more demarcation. The term ''great'' is ambivalent. lt could mean 'fantastic' as well. That will cause problems for us. That rebellious woman, Antigone ... The disclaimer text is too noble. ''A great event we announce, yet we do not announce violence.'' Did you add this text? - lt seemed appropriate to balance Sophocles' text with the disclaimer text. To keep with its style, to premise it, almost like a chorus. But that's exactly what makes the disclaimer vague. These allusions ... burials denied, female terrorists ... The piece is from the 5th century B.C. lt's Sophocles! lt's no comfort to discover that there were female terrorists even in the 5th century B.C. We have a second disclaimer version. Please. We didn't choose to announce a great event. We were forced to announce this great event. That's enough. At least it should be ''great calamity'' instead of ''great event''. That would ruin the verse. And what was it that forced the women to this announcement? Creon's refusal to let Polynices be buried. The rule of law, then. Gentlemen, l don't think this is the place to discuss Sophocles. All we have to discuss is whether the disclaimer is credible. l also think that the term ''great event'' is ambivalent. lt should be ''great calamity''. Then it would be clear that the two women distance themselves from the event. This ... stylistic approximation of Sophocles is misleading. We also have a third version of the disclaimer. Please. lt is unavoidable, and impossible to overlook, that in some pieces, even classical ones, violence is portrayed. We distance ourselves absolutely from every form of violence. We say this in the name of the directors, the administration, the entire cast, the stage hands, the cashiers, and in the name of everyone directly or indirectly involved in this production. Sister... of my blood and heart, lsmene ... Name one of Oedipus' curses that Zeus has not already fulfilled in our lives. That sounds better. But l think it somehow humiliates Sophocles' text. lt seems silly, artificial, almost ironic. Not convincing. And irony is something we can do without right now. lf we completely skip the disclaimer, and just do the Sophocles text ... l mean, if we can't even do Sophocles anymore ... The next word will be censorship, and then it'll be fascism. Gentlemen! What is this nonsense? Let me remind you that there used to be 'clean' classics for 'Upper-class' girls' schools. The resulting editions omitted certain passages found in Ovid and elsewhere. We're over that. Are we now to check the classics for political references and remove them? Try to understand our situation! Our backs are against the wall. l ask myself if it's necessary, at a time like this, to put on Antigone. A refusal to allow a burial ... rebellious women ... and that soothsayer, Teiresias, a precursor of the prophet, a kind of anticipation of an intellectual. The youth will misinterpret this as a call to subversion. The churches should see this! l'm sorry l didn't see the entire scope of ... The title of the series is 'Youth Meets Classics'. - Exactly! So the production is cancelled? 800,000 marks have been put into the production. This is not about money. We have to think of the viewers. l suggest that the production go ahead, and that the finished film be held back until things calm down. lt's simply too topical. The end as well. What will we broadcast instead? - Director, sir, the repeat of the dramatization of Hoegner's ''Bellum Gallicum'' was a very instructive piece. Violence against the Gauls, violence by the Gauls, Roman violence, Gallic violence, Caesar, Vercingetorix ... But it's about war, not about terror. l'd like to add that it's a very good production. Really. Very good. lt's just not the right time to broadcast it. The viewers wouldn't understand it. ls it really Sophocles' ending? - Yes, it is. Yes, perhaps ... Maybe it's better this way. ... not to mention the truth. Should l gild the truth, only to be proved a liar? Truth determines all. l am drawn to the son's voice. Come closer, people, quickly! Hasten to the tomb and enter through the gap in the wall. Come to the door and see if it is Haemon's voice l hear, or if l'm deceived by a god. We listened, like the distraught one ordered, and saw her at the back of the tomb, strangled with a noose, the fine linen of her veil about her neck. And he clasped her body, bewailing their wedding which death denied, his father's deed, and his poor bride. Seeing this, the father groaned, and rushed forward to him crying, ''What have you done? What ailed you? Has misfortune driven you mad? Come out, my child, l beg of you.'' With wild eyes, the son glared at him with disgust. Without a word he drew his sword and smote, but as the father fled, he missed. He turned his wrath against himself, driving the blade half its length into his chest. But still aware, he clasps a lax arm around the maiden. And suddenly, from the dying one, a fountain erupts, flooding her pallid cheeks with bloody red. The dead lies now with the dead, celebrating marriage rites in the house of Hades. The graves have been protected from rain by corrugated sheets. My sister Gudrun, Jan and Andreas expressed the wish to be buried in one grave. Und ... l ... When l came back from holidays, the first thing l read in the paper was ''lnto the sewers with them!'' And l know that people called for them to be ''buried outside'' and the like. Rommel decided autonomously, without consulting the city council. ''They'll be buried on the Dornhaldenfeld Cemetery. That's it!'' Bosch is buried there as well, the industrialist. As is Theodor Heuss and Reinhold Maier. As for the question of the burial of the three dead terrorists ... lt was clear to me that this had to be decided quickly and cleanly ... - What do you mean? Clean in the admistrative sense, or the human sense? Clean in the human sense. lt would have been unbearable to carry the responsibility, even in part, for weeks and months of discussions about the proper burial of the terrorists. That's why l made the quick and binding decision. Ensslin's father had tried hard, desperately, to find graves. ln Stuttgart he had considerable difficulties, for three terrorists, people outside of society ... People couldn't accept their burial within the walls of a city or parish. Outside, on a field, sure. But not where so-called normal people are buried. Mr. Eschwege, we need ... - That's fine. First it's Andreas, then Gudrun, and then Jan. lt's a double grave, with the three of them together. Can the dividing wall be torn down? - No, it can't. lf you look down, you'll see it's been chiseled out of the rock. You can't ... l couldn't come here and remove the dividing wall. But the way it is, they're all on the same level. Andreas and Jan in one grave, and Gudrun isn't off to the side or anything. lt is a unit. l think it's fine. And ... uh ... We should accept, don't you think? lt's a funeral like any other. l don't think it's right if others shirk their responsibility. We somethimes get customers who are not so agreeable. For me, a guest is a guest. l see it the same way. lt was a spontaneous decision, after l heard that Mr. Ensslin had been turned down for certain reasons. How did you find that out? An innkeeper couple told me, adding their respective commentary. lt really enraged me, so l went straight to the phone, called Mr. Ensslin, and explained that l wanted, for purely humanitarian reasons, to put on this funeral meal for him. Once it even happened that the October angels came in May as foreign October angels, looking for local November angels. They had been shot, though. WHOEVER ATTACkS THE FRG COMMlTS SUlClDE (LEBER) Thursday, October 27th, Dornhalden Cemetery, Stuttgart. GUDRUN, ANDREAS + JAN TORTURED AND MURDERED lN STAMMHElM This way, please! - And lift! Quiet! - What is this crap? Please stand back to give the family some room. Hey, you photo vultures! Hold on. Hold on. Would the family members please step forward? Please let the family members through. Hold on. Hold on, please. The cemetery, a former shooting range, is at risk of flooding. We didn't think the path that these comrades took was the right one. But in light of their deaths, and the circumstances of their deaths, that becomes secondary. The solidarity will remain! lf you are truly outraged, affected and mobilized, you won't shout, but rather consider what to do. Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! The police, as you can see, are present. The police were prepared. One may not talk of a 'plan'. The police had to intervene, because a vehicle had been damaged by the participants. Here, Ritchy. Come over here! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! TO THE MURDERED COMRADES Careful, the back door. - Thank you. Did you open it? - Yes. Drive slowly. We were checked again. And what's this? ''Once a certain level of atrocity has been achieved, it's irrelevant who is responsible. lt simply has to stop.''
