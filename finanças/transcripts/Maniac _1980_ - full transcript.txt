You know, this last guy wanted the ultimate. You should have seen what his idea of “the ultimate” was. I mean, I thought I've seen them all, but this guy had something that was a new one even on me. So, um, how you doin' tonight, kid? You look a little down. I need one more trick to make my rent. Hmm. I know how that is. Oh, here's somebody. Hey.

Why didn't you stop me? Mommy. I didn't wanna do it. I didn't wanna do it. Mommy. I didn't wanna do it. Why'd you make me do that? I didn't wanna do it. I didn't wanna do that. Christmas shopping, Mr. Zito? Yes, Terry. Miss me? You're gonna like it here. Oh, yes. I told you not to go out tonight, didn't I? Every time you go out, this kind of thing happens. This has got to stop. It's silly. And it's not getting us anywhere. You think they don't know? They do. I heard it, and I know. They all know, and I don't like it anymore. But you don't listen, do you? It's got to stop. You'll like it here. Oh, you're right about them. All of them. They're all the same. I know what they're like. Just because I can't do the things you do, doesn't mean I don't see it all the same. Fancy-schmancy. And what are we supposed to do? Sit and smile and, “Yes, miss,” “No, miss,” “Not now, miss”? “Whatever you say, miss”? I know. I know how it is with their airs and their looks and their... They can drive a man crazy! I Di... I didn't mean that. I didn't mean it that way. It's just that they... they don't know when to stop. They never know when to stop. That's why they have to be stopped. It is. You're right. You're right. But not like that. Not that way. Please. They'll take you away from me. You have to be careful. You have to listen to me. We can't live like this. I have to go out. And each time, it's like this. I get so scared that they'll take you away. But they won't if you do what I say. They won't take you away. Not ever. Not ever, I swear. Not ever. Polly want a cracker? Hmm? Hmm? I'll be right back. Hello. Is your, uh... Is your boyfriend waiting for you tonight? Are you kidding? Of course. He's gonna have a long wait. Why do you say that? Um...

Get outta here! ...what happened at the governor's mansion in Albany yesterday. This is George Garrison from On The Spot News. Right now, we are live over midtown Manhattan, bringing you the latest update on one of the most violent killing sprees in our city's history. Following yesterday's brutal slaying of a young couple under the Verrazano Bridge, New York City Police Commissioner Paul Delaney has assigned a special task force of over two dozen detectives to join in on the manhunt for a madman who has left five dead in the metropolitan area. The peculiar yet brutal disfigurement of the bodies has led police to believe that one man is responsible for the killings. So far, witnesses are few, and detectives are stumped for clues. Back in local politics, Assemblyman Anthony Ventura... You tell me what I should do. I heard about it. I always do. I can't go out for a minute. It's impossible. Fancy girls and their fancy dresses and their lipstick... laughing and dancing. But you stop them, don't you? I can't stop "em. But you do, don't you? Then they can't laugh, and they can't dance anymore. So you got to stop, or they'll take you away from me. I won't ever... let them take you away from me. You're mine now forever... and I'm so happy. And, uh, I got on TV. Denise, be careful. - Don't swing so high. - Okay, I won't. All of my friends were so surprised. Denise, you wanna ride our bikes? My mother said I can't leave the park. Oh, come on. Come on. Okay. Be careful, little girl. Pat, are you sure Jerry and I can't give you a ride home? Oh, no, thanks, Kath. Ken'll be here in a second. And if not, I'll splurge and take a taxi. Well, here's the newspaper, if you wanna read it while you're waiting. Are you sure you don't need it? I wanna check my horoscope. No, I already read it this afternoon on my break. Oh, I hate reading the newspapers these days with that kook running around. Yuck. I know. That guy's really a sicko. I hope they catch him soon. Yeah... Oh, be sure and check Mr. Gannon's I.V. on your shift tomorrow. He, uh, pulled it out again tonight. Not again. He's too much! Will. I'm so cold. Here's Jerry. Okay. - You sure I can't give you a lift? - No, thanks. Okay. See you tomorrow. Night! Hi. Open! Open up! This is what you like, baby, isn't it? This is what you like, isn't it? Yeah, this is what you like. It's nice, isn't it? Now, now, now. It'll be all right. Look, it's just a little inconvenient. I know how upsetting it is. But it's just a little blood. It'll wash out. Look, you have to be more careful. Yes. You're getting very careless... blood in your hair. Tsk, tsk, tsk. What will people say? What will we do? You want to look pretty, don't you? Pretty for me? You're so pretty. Hold on. I'm coming. - Who is it? - Yes, uh, my name is Frank Zito. You took my picture in the park. May I speak with you? Come in. That's... That's amazing. I was just looking at a photo I took of you in the park. Really? Well, uh, it's a coincidence, because what I wanted to, uh, speak to you about... - Do you mind if I take a look? - Certainly. Oh, great. - Here you are. - Thanks. Listen, um... Listen, how come all your models are women? Well, it's just something I'm interested in as a woman. In fact, this is my fourth series. It's called Woman Four. Not very original, is it? Well, it's not the title that matters that much. No. No. Listen, do you get to, uh, keep them all? I'm hoping to sell them. I wouldn't. I-I'd keep 'em forever. But why? I mean, part of my profession is to sell photographs. It's not all for art's sake, you know. I know, but why do you take pictures of women this way? I like to make them look beautiful. No. I think it's more to preserve them. You see, the beauty is already in the model. Frank, don't be silly. - Listen, I'm the photographer, right? - Right. So I should know what I'm doing, shouldn't I? I know, but to me, you know, things change, people die. But in a painting or a picture, they're yours forever. There's no way you can possess someone forever, even in a photograph. There's no way. Well, I was noticing this picture of this old lady here. At one point in her life, she was someone's sister, someone's wife, someone's mother. And when the photographer took her picture, he had her the way he wanted her. She could never leave him. She couldn't grow old, and she couldn't die. Tell me, Frank. What do you do for a living? - Um, I'm a painter. - Yeah? Abstracts, some still lifes, some landscapes. You know, things like that. I'd love to see some of your work sometime. - You would? - I'd love to, yes. Listen, uh, Anna, I know this place over in New Jersey, you know? - Yeah? - Clams Casino. - Italian food. - Mm-hmm. And, uh... Would you like to have dinner? Why, Frank, are you asking me for a date? - You talkin' to me? - I'm talking to you. I'd love to, yes. I really would. Give me five minutes, and I'll be right with you. Great. You're the most beautiful woman I've seen since, uh, my mom. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thanks. - Have you got a picture of her? - Yeah. - Here. It's when she was younger. - Oh, right. Tell me, where does she live? Oh, we lived in Queens, but, uh, my mother was taken from me in an automobile accident when I was younger. I'm sorry. - She really was lovely. - Mm-hmm. Mmm, it's a shame. - Listen, Frank. - What? Rita's coming to the loft tonight at 9:00, and I want to get all the work finished. So she promised me she'd work overtime. So, in other words, it's an early night. Is that it? It is really. Well, as long as I can see you again, I mean... - Yes, of course. - Great. What about tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Let's see if I'm booked. No, of course tomorrow night would be great. But I know you're very busy, and I'm sure that, uh, something will come up. I might be and, then again, I might not be. Oh, but I'll definitely see you on Thursday at the show. - No kidding. - You'll be there. Yes, and so will five million other guys. - Oh, Frank. - What? - Are you annoyed? - No. I mean, that would be ridiculous, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. Mr. Steiner's doing this... He's having this really big celebration. He's asked all these people from Art World down, and it... it could be something really special for me. I understand. I wish you the best of luck, Anna. I know you do. Yeah. I just hope you really do understand. - Do I have a choice? - Mmm. - No. Not really. - No. - Well, figures. - No. That's lovely. That's it. Oh! That looks so good. Closer together. Okay. Hold that. Yeah, that's it. Smile. - That's great. Come on, ladies. It's looking good. - Okay, right. - Right. Right. Closer. - That's beautiful. That really looks good. Pout your lips a bit. You two on... That's... Oh, that's really nice. - Okay. That... That's it. No, not like... I don't really... No, that's... - Wet your lips. Wet your lips, Joan. That's beautiful. - Uh-uh. Listen. It's all wrong. - What's the matter? - What's the matter, Lou? - Jenny... Jenny's dress doesn't work. - Who did her makeup? Who did her makeup? - They did it themselves. Why? Listen, we gotta do something with it. It's just not right. - You don't like it. Okay, okay. - The necklace, everything. Yeah, he's right. That's giving too much flare, Rita. - Better take it off. - Oh, it's my mother's. I know, I know. I like it, but... Take it off, okay? Frank. It's really good to see you. Yeah, well, I came by. I took the invitation. - I hope I'm not disturbing anybody. - Not at all. No. - I brought you a present. - Thank you very much. Sit down. - Yeah. Thanks. - Thank you. Now, what's this? - What do you think of the session? - I think it's fabulous. Oh. Oh, my goodness. Oh, he's beautiful. Oh, I love him. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Mm-hmm. By the way, this is Rita. Rita, come here. It's the girl you saw in the photograph. Remember? Oh, yes. Nice to meet you. You're more beautiful in person than you are in your photograph. I love it. Anna, listen. I'm sure you and your friend have a lot to talk about, but we're paying these models a hundred dollars an hour. - I know. I know. - I would like to get back to the shoot. - Could we please start? Thank you. - Fine. Be right with you. Okay, Frank, you can stay as long as you like. - Thanks for the bear. - Okay. That's... That's better. That's beautiful. That's much better. Okay, come on, ladies. Back to work. You feeling refreshed? You're looking good. - You're looking really good. Here we go. Smile. That's it. - That looks so good. - Okay. Both of you. Both of you. - Fantastic. You're looking really good. - Keep moving. - That's beautiful. - That looks really good. - Come on. Come on. Pout your lips. - Hands on your hips. - That's it. Both of you. - That's perfect. That really looks good. - Fine. Okay. Keep that for three. I'm comin'. - Who is it? - Frank, Rita. Anna's friend. Yeah? Did you lose something? Oh. Oh, where'd you find this? Well, I got it at the studio. I figured you need it, so I brought it over. It was nice of you to bring it by. Thank you. Well... I'll see ya. - Good night. - Good night. Why do you do these things? I don't understand why you do these things. Don't lie to me! You try to pretend you don't know. Your hair is different. Yeah. And you look different, but you can't fool me. I know it's you. I don't want to hurt you. I only want to talk to you. Okay? I'll take it out if you promise not to scream. You promise? There. That's better. There. You can trust me. You know you can. There's no reason for you to try and run away. But now we're back together again. And I'll never let you go. Never. Now, you were wrong to try to hurt me. You left me alone lots of times. I was scared. Real scared. I hid in the closet. Did you know that? No, you didn't know that. I was afraid that you wouldn't come back. But I won't cry now. Uh-uh. No. I knew you'd come back. You did come back. I found you. I knew I would. And now you're mine, all mine. Why did you need those other men? They didn't love you. I did. I loved you. I needed you. There were so many men. I never wanted to hurt you. I never wanted to hurt you. Never. But there were so many men. There was... So many men. Why? Because they gave you some dollars? But they didn't love you. I loved you. Only me. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Frank, don't kill me. No. No. I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to keep you... so you'll never go away. I'm just going to keep you SO you won't go away ever again. Mommy. Oh, Mommy. Mommy. Oh, Mommy. Oh, Mommy! Mommy. Not tonight. You ain't goin' out tonight. Tonight, you stay home... with me. You know, when Mommy tells you to... hide in the closet... you have to do what Mommy tells you... or else you know what happens. - Hello. - Hello, Anna. This is Frank. I was wondering if you'd like to take in a show tonight. Sounds like a good idea, Frank. Could you be ready in about 15 minutes, say? - I can be ready in 10. - Okay, I'll see you. Okay. Bye. What's that for? Oh, it's just to thank you. Thank you for sending the... the flowers for the funeral parlor and... and for attending the funeral. Rita didn't have many friends, and I really appreciated it. It's okay. Look, I was wondering if we could stop by the cemetery. I want to pay my respects to my mother. I usually drop off a wreath... I have it in the back seat... at Christmastime. Would that be all right, before we go to dinner? - Of course. - Fabulous. Thanks. Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy... - Oh, my head. - Frank. - Oh, my head hurts. - Frank, what's the matter? - What's the matter? - It hurts. - My head hurts. - Don't.
