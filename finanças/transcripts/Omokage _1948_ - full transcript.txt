Excuse me, but who are you? - Please tell him Kaoru has come. - Certainly, Miss. - Please, wait here. - Thank you. This time Engineer Kawasaki has made an effort to plan. These are difficult times to get materials, Dr. Inagaki must be in a hurry. Excellent! Then, at last, it will be passed to the people on the building site. When could we start work? Maybe the beginning of next month. Let me make arrangements with the constructors. Then, let's go to the building site. - Well, I'll go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Ah, OK. Kawasaki! - Yes? - My niece has arrived, can you tell her to wait a moment, please? - All right. Excuse me... - Are you from the Inagaki family? - Yes. - Dr. Inagaki said he wouldn't be long. Please wait. - Thank you. - Please, wait there. - Oh, thank you. - Please, have something cold to drink. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Thank you for waiting. - I'm glad you came. - Uncle, welcome back! - You're so busy! - On your way home after dressmaking class? - Yes. - Did you arrive at the hotel yesterday? - Yes, I've a project here. - Really? - Are you going back to Tokyo? - Yes, I'll go home for the summer holiday. - Is the company on holiday too? - That's right. I'm off. How nice! - How has Sachiko been? - Aunt is full of spirit. Today, she asked me to bring you something. It's something for you, you'll really love it. She made it. - It looks delicious. - Yes, it must be nice. And a letter for you from her. What has she written? - Sir, it's a call from your house. - Oh, thank you. - From home? - Yes, I've asked they contact me here. It's for everyone. Hello, Sachiko? It's me. Oh, sorry... Are you Oshige? Can you ask Sachiko to pick up the phone? Uncle, don't be in a hurry! Sachiko? How have you been? Oh sorry, you're Fukuko. I'm sorry, Sachiko is having a bath right now. - She's waiting for your arrival. - No, it's not true, sister! Please tell him: "Take it easy". It's very hot. She's saying what I've just said, and it's so hot. Then, please take it easy. - Hi. - Has your niece gone? - Is your wife waiting for you? Not really. But, I envy you for your happiness. If we hadn't encouraged you, you'd have stayed single all your life. But, now he has a young and beautiful wife, and seems the happiest husband of all us. Well. Please try it, my wife made it. Thank you. Mr. Kitagawa, would you like to try it? Oh, how tasty! - You can play piano! - No, I wouldn't say that. I can only play this music. I'm just copying. You have a really good hobby. My late wife taught me. Then, this is your tune. So, you were a devoted husband. No, I'm definitely not in your league. Really hot, right? Let's go there. You can come to my country house. - I don't know if I should. - Why not? I've already told my wife you'd come. - Everyone is looking forward to seeing you. - But... It doesn't deserve to be called a country house. But, even such a country house is better than a company residence. Thank you very much, but... I'm also thinking of visiting my wife's grave, it's been a long time. It's a good idea, you must remember her again... I see... If you come to Yukawa and enjoy the summer, your wife would be relieved for you. And I want you to help me to publish the next book. Can you see the lighthouse? My home is around there. From here it takes an hour by bus. Thank you. - Welcome home! - Please unload my luggage. Haven't you come by bus? No, they sent a car from the hotel. He is our guest, Mr. Kawasaki. Welcome! Thank you for yesterday. Oh, did you meet her at the hotel yesterday? - Aunt has come too. - Oh, really. Aunt! Aunt! Yes! Welcome home! Thank you for coming for me. Welcome home! - You came by limousine taxi? - Yes, it's from the hotel. You look fine. Thank you for the drink yesterday. - Everyone said it was delicious. - Oh... I said it was just for you... I gave it to everyone, and everyone loved it. They said it's impossible to taste anything as fresh in Tokyo. This is Mr. Kawasaki. Thank you for coming. - My husband's talked so much about you. - Thank you for your invitation. I forced him to come here, - so, please treat him well. - Don't worry about it, uncle. - Mr. Kawasaki! - Please! - I'll carry them. - Oh, thank you. Mr. Kawasaki! Oh, Oshige! - Thank you for yesterday. - Welcome home. She always helps me. Really. Thank you so much. How is Matsuzo? He's really well. Darling, darling! Oh, the professor! Welcome home! - Welcome home! - Thank you for helping my wife. No, Oshige always owes your wife a great deal. We have a guest, could you prepare something? - OK, I'll prepare something and later Oshige can take it. - Thank you. - Well, see you later. - See you later. Thank you for waiting. Excuse me, but I asked your husband not to treat me like a guest... In this remote village it's impossible to avoid it. Don't worry about it. Darling! How is the bath? Just fine! - I'll leave your clothes here. - Uncle's on the right, left for Mr. Kawasaki! You're working hard today, Kaoru! When guests come from Tokyo, they are really happy. It's inconvenient not to have a house in Tokyo. But it's a big help for us that at least we have this house. I need only go to the school and the firm, and it's good to live here for our health. Here you are. Uncle, it's your favorite drink. Mr. Kawasaki, you must be bothered by this jelly. Thank you for everything. Oh, no! Sister! Sister! What's happened? There are cicadas. Please pick them! Do your homework first, or mother will scold you! Hurry, hurry, they're going! Be quiet! We have a guest! Who? From Tokyo? This is the work, I want you to help me with. There's a lot to do. The publishing company is in a hurry, but I'm too busy to do it... Have you finished your homework, Takashi? - You have homework, right? - Yes. After finishing your homework, you can go out, alright? Mother, we have a guest. - He's from Tokyo! - Really! Welcome home. I heard you caught a cold. Are you over it? Yes, I'm fine, thank you. - Oh, Kawasaki, this is Fukuko, my wife's elder sister. - Welcome. I'm Kawasaki. Nice to meet you. She teaches in a girls' school. And thinks it necessary to educate the children strictly. - Of course, it's a mystery. - You're starting it again. I can't be like you, you aren't strict at all. Then, you and I, divided by two, must be perfect. Yes, I think so. - Then, see you later. - Yes. We've cleaned upstairs. - Please, Mr. Kawasaki. - Show him the room. - Please. - Then, I'll go. - Thank you for coming on this hot day and helping us. - You're welcome. - Here. - It's a nice room. Very relaxing. - It's my aunt's room. - Your aunt's? - You don't like it? - No, but I'm sorry to take her room. Don't worry, because you are our guest. Your name is Kawasaki Ryuichi, right? You know my name? It's because of your bag! R.Y.U.I.C.H.I. So, you are Ryuichi! You are my uncle's pupil? Yes, he taught me at school, and after I entered the company, we work together. Then you're an engineer? - Please let's be friends. - OK. I'll go to Tokyo to work soon. Why? Because only my mother works in our family. May I came in? - I'm sorry the room's not in order. - Please don't bother about me. - I'm used to living alone. - Please, use this room as if you were at home. Also you can use this dressing table. And I've brought cigarettes. I'll leave the pyjamas here. - Please make yourself at home. - Thank you. We can see the lighthouse... It's a good place! Yes. Mr. Kawasaki! Why don't we go to the shore? Sir, let's go to the sea! OK, let's go! - I've prepared some cigarettes. Have you finished? - Oh, thank you. - Please keep some for Kawasaki. - I've already have given him them. Thank you. - Uncle? We're taking a walk. - Take care! - See you later! Oh, Kawasaki, wait a moment. Please give him a hat. Yes, we have a straw hat. Please wait a moment. - They are already familiar with him. - No problem. Isn't he a really nice person? - He's your favorite. - I can make friends with whom I like. He seems to be serious. It's a waste for him to remain as engineer in the company. He is active, he's lively and cheerful. But, he seems so sad. Suddenly his spirit falls. It's possible to be like like that. He lost his wife in the war. Oh, no, his wife? I'm sorry about that. Please take care of him as much as you can. What do you think of him? How about him? He doesn't speak badly like you, does he? If I had a daughter, I'd ask him to marry her... I think he and Kaoru would make a good couple. How old is he? He's 32, if I remember correctly. Kaoru is only nineteen. However, Sachiko is 28 and I'm 50, but we're going well. But, it's not for everyone. You are a special couple. I don't like be treated as a special couple. But, we should think if the people who depend on the happiness... are happy or not. Sometimes... You are quite right. But, I think Kaoru and Kawasaki would make a good couple. - Takashi! - Yes! - It's a pink. I really like it. - Really. - Hey, - What? What does your aunt do every day? Various things. Aunt and uncle get along really well. When he isn't at home, she speaks only about him. Mr. Kawasaki! Crab! Really! Kaoru! Kaoru! Kaoru! - Hello! - Hi! Has the professor returned? Yes, he has just come back. He's on his summer holidays. Very nice! Then, please tell him to come play billiards tonight. Please! OK! Kaoru! - Don't forget it. please! - Right! - Is he a doctor? - Yes, he is. He's really nice person, but... - he is so insistent. - Really? What's your diagnosis? Let's give... a camphor injection. After all, a quack doctor can't manage it. You should give up soon. Professor! It's not crowded now, so, you can come if you want. OK, but, please wait a minute. I'll finish this doctor off. - Good evening. - Hi. It's a long time since you've been back home. You really are good. Game and set! - Then, please play with Dr. Horie. - OK. - At last it's started raining! - Yes, it's very wet this year. - Here you are. - Oh, thank you. Hello. Anyway, when a man has a young wife, he's very careful about his appearance. Is it like that? Yes, like that. And, he rejuvenates day by day. It's demonstrated medically. Do I have more white hair? You seem to get younger every day. - Good evening. - Oh, Madam. - You've come for him, haven't you? - My husband? Where is he? Oh, he's at the barber's. He wants to try to look as good as he can. - Dr. Horie, you always say the same... - You mean that I'm insistent. I'm like that by nature. - Look out! There's a puddle! - Thank you. - Mr. Kawasaki, watch out there. - Thank you. - You got wet, didn't you? - Don't worry, darling. We're home. Welcome back. - I'm using your desk. - I'm home. Are you working now? - Please use it. - Thank you. He was tough tonight. The doctor was a little insistent. I'll make tea. Excuse me, Kawasaki... - Can you bring me my pipe? It's on the shelf. - OK. Teachers have a lot of work now due to changes in the system. That's right. Nowadays young people mistake freedom for selfishness. That's terrible. So, I insist that they should take responsibility. I say they should have an obligation for their behavior. Come on, come on. You see, you're off again. I'm going now. Oh, please have tea. Sachiko is preparing it now. Thank you, but it will keep me awake. - Good night. - Good night. - Then, me too... - Why do you have to leave now? You should go to bed. Are you leaving early? Yes. Are Mr. Kawasaki and uncle talking? - Sorry. - Don't worry about it. - My sister? - Fukuko has gone to bed. I made this. I'm not sure if you'll like it... She makes it very well. Please try it. - It's delicious. - Thank you. Kawasaki, in this world, it's said that marriage is the graveyard of human life, but it's a lie. Marriage is the flower garden of human life. - We're just about to get better. - That's right. In your case, especially. But there are unfortunate people like you. When did your wife pass away? Three years ago. - Do you have a child? - No, he doesn't. I'm sure that your wife was a really beautiful woman. What type of woman... has the same taste as you? We got married because our parents encouraged us. She was a daughter of my relative. But, after her death, I think sometimes that I should have been more kind to her... while she was alive. - I should imagine you were very kind. - He was a devoted husband. You should give your love to a new wife. Then, the next time you will have a happily married life. I suppose that a man who has an unhappy experience takes good care of his wife. What do you think... to taking a new wife? I know someone just for you. - No, I haven't thought of it yet. - Really? - I hope you do think about it. - But, it's much too sudden. - Mr. Kawasaki seems to be embarrassed. - Why should he feel embarrassed? Darling... - I'll go to bed. - Don't go yet. - Good night. - Sachiko, let's listen to the radio. - Right. It's time to say goodnight. Before going to bed, let us allow ourselves, a short while to reﬂect quietly on what we have done during the day and air our hopes for tomorrow 31 -September-1943 Kawasaki Akiko - Excuse me, Mr. Kawasaki! - Yes! If there are mosquitos, you can burn incense. - Thank you. - Good night! Good night! Oh, are you going? Yes. I don't have class, but I must attend a meeting this afternoon. - Is it Mr. Kawasaki's? - Yes, - It's quite worn. - It's normal. If you mend it, he can wear it for longer. Yes, I think so. By the way, he's single, but is quite tidy. I suppose he doesn't want show his difficult life to other people. I'd like to help him. But, unlike the young of today he's so calm, isn't he? Oh, I'll miss the bus. Take care! R.K Kawasaki Thank you very much. - I think it's alright now, please check it. - OK. I'm home! Oh, your cheeks are all dirty! Don't move! When is the meeting? The day after tomorrow, 20th is that right? - Oh, not the 20th... - Do you have other plans? - Yes, but they're private. - To tell you the truth, it's our wedding anniversary... - Oh, really... But, it'll be finished by the evening. Mr. Kawasaki, let's go to the sea! OK. Let's go! Why don't you come with us, aunt? Well... alright, I'll come. - Let's swim, aunt! - Oh, we'll swim? - Aunt swims really well. - Oh, really. Let's go together! But... I've forgotten how to swim. No, no, aunt. Aunt! - Sister! - Uncle! How is your swimming? - How is her swimming? - She's doing really well. I didn't know that she did so well like this. Really. I'd like to see it. Let's swim! This time we can try a long-distance swim. We'll go as far as we can. I can't believe you said you couldn't swim so well. How dare you say such a thing! - Because it's true, Kaoru, isn't it? - Takashi! - Let's swim, aunt! - Let's swim, Mr. Kawasaki! - OK. - Takashi! - Sister! - Can we finish the project this evening? - Yes, it's what we planned. - Mr. Kawasaki? - Yes. Come in. You must be tired. - It isn't very tasty... - Thank you. - Hasn't the Professor come back yet? - I suppose he'll come back soon... He must be worried. I suppose so. Which anniversary is it? Our fifth. - I'm already old. - No, not yet. You are still young. You were born in Tokyo, right? Yes, in Kouenji, in Suginami. Oh, we are from Asagawa. It's really near. We had a bookstore. We also sold drawing materials and stationery. There are many markets there after the war, the streets were packed. Really? Before the war it was such a quiet place. I used to take a walk to Inokashira. I also used to walk around there. Then we might have met there. - Aunt! - Yes! - You have a phone call from uncle! - Right! Hello, Sachiko? I'm in trouble. We have finished the meeting, but, they insist that I should be present at the dinner. I can't flatly refuse, so... I'll get away as soon as possible. I feel really sorry for keeping you waiting, so, please start dinner without me. Please say hello to everyone. Congratulations on your marriage! Thank you so much! Then, could I see your presents? It's from me. - Wow, all those cicadas! - For getting them, - I fell from the tree three times! - So, you were injured with honour. The next is Kaoru? These are the shoes of happiness. I wish you eternal happiness. Thank you, I'll keep them carefully. What will you present me, Mr. Kawasaki? I didn't prepare anything, so it's a book I had with me. It's "A Theory of Happiness" by Alain! Wonderful!!! You sung very well! Here you are. Now it's your turn, Kaoru. Please. What can I do? A shell... is sleeping. with a vacant mind in the pure sand, dimly hearing the distant roar of the tide. What is the shell dreaming? A shell is sleeping, with a vacant mind in the pure sand, hearing the tide on a moonlit night. What is the shell dreaming? I wish all the people dream of happiness. Have you finished? Yes, I've read only some nice phrases. Right, Mother? Yes, that's right. "I wish happiness to the people who dream today". Now, it's your turn, Mr. Kawasaki, right? - Mr. Kawasaki!!! - No, no I can't. Oh, you can play the piano, can't you? My husband said so. How nice!!! I don't play very well. And I always play the same piece. I heard his late wife taught him. I would really like to hear you play. - Oh, no... - If you don't it's unfair! - Right? - What's the name of the piece? - Attracted by Flowers. - Oh, it's a song Sachiko really likes. Why don't you sing it? You can ask Mr. Kawasaki to accompany you. Oh, no... - It isn't fair not to play it! - You should sing it! Mr. Kawasaki, please! Please. Please accompany me. A spring breeze is always blowing softly, The ﬂowers are always trembling, They have a passionate love for the morning, The clouds hesitate, A spring breeze is always blowing softly, The ﬂowers are always trembling, A spring breeze is always blowing softly, The ﬂowers are always trembling A spring breeze is always blowing softly, I feel a warm glow in my heart, I feel a warm glow in my heart - Welcome home. - You sang really well. - Welcome home. - Uncle, congratulations on your marriage. - Congratulations on your marriage! - Thanks. - Congratulations on your marriage! - Sorry I'm so late. I rushed back. I'm really sorry. If you'd come back earlier... - Right, sister? - Yes. - It's a present. How nice! It was the first time I've heard Sachiko's singing, you sing very well. We wanted to hear Mr. Kawasaki play the piano, so I insisted on singing. I also did whether I wanted or not. I'm sorry. It's a present from Mr. Kawasaki. Oh, it's "A Theory of Happiness" by Alain. Thank you. I'll read it. - Would you have dinner? - Of course, I'll have it. Please wait a moment, I'll prepare it. Oh, it's stopped raining. How humid it's suddenly become. I've been really happy these five years. In the 50 years of my life, these five years have been the most beautiful and pleasant. Even the tragedy of the war, couldn't hurt our happiness. Even a person like me, can imagine the happiness of you and your wife. I wish I'd been younger, because I married late in life, for her sake. It's as if I'm a criminal stealing her youth. That's just your imagination... For example, she swims well, sings well. Until today I didn't even know. In a case like this, I feel sorry for her. And at the same time, I feel sad for myself, because I can't go along with her youth. Professor, but on the other side, your good points more than offset your weaknesses. Of course, I try to make an effort. My wish is that Sachiko be happy and free. I suppose she thinks the same. I believe so. But, don't you think it's strange? Far from thinking it strange, I feel good listening to you speaking so frankly. But a couple so well matched, must be like you. Yes, I think so. After all, it's the only way to be happy that a married couple should trust each other and deepen their love. - And they should be honest each other. - Yes. Sachiko works really well, so I can devote myself to my work. - You and your wife are different. - I'm honored by your praise. Oh, how cheerful, what are you talking about? About my theory of happiness. He's telling me about you and your happiness. Really. You smoke too much! - I shouldn't do it. I'm taking care of smoking in Tokyo, Kawasaki? - Yes. He doesn't listen to me although I warn him. Alright, alright. Please help me, Mr. Kawasaki. Because I would be at a loss if he doesn't live a long life. - Please. - No, thank you. It's about time a bachelor went to bed. Then you'd better get married. I'll introduce you to a girl. Right, Sachiko? It's true, Mr. Kawasaki. - If you'll excuse me. - Don't go. Don't say that, please come here. - Mr. Kawasaki. - Thank you for dinner. - Good night. - Don't go yet. - Can I talk him about the matter in question? - Yes. Can you ask your sister to come down? But, it's too late tonight... - Never hesitate to do good. - OK. Sunﬂower It has already bloomed alone Big and wide... Burning pupil... Silently... Blinking back my tears... - Thank you for lunch. - You're welcome. Look there. Here, here. OK. - Look, Mr. Kawasaki... - Yes. I'm afraid to talk you but... What is it? - What do you think about Kaoru? - What can I say? - She's pretty. - Only that? What do you think her as a wife? Of course, she would make a marvellous wife. Is she getting married then? Married? We hope she'd maybe marry you. If you don't mind. To me? Yes. What happened? No, don't worry. - Please use it. - No, I don't want to dirty it. Thank you. - Are you alright? - Yes. Aunt, it's awful, it's going to pour down. Oh, really? Yes, the woman divers are going home. Ma'am, it's going to rain. There's nothing to be done. What do you think, Mr. Kawasaki? Mr. Matsuo! Is there a hotel around here? Yes, there's a hotel, 'Iwame Kan", just over there. Then, we can go there. - OK, Mr. Kawasaki? - Yes. Hello, Sachiko? Really, we were worried. Here there's a storm too. They took refuge in a hotel from the storm. It's me! Yes, I know. It's really difficult to go to the station. Take it easy, you can stay there tonight. Excuse me. Unfortunately, the power's gone off. Here you are. - I'm sorry, we've no medicine. If you don't mind using this? - What is this? - It's Mercurochrome. - It's good enough for me. - I'll put it on you. - Thank you. Is it too early to prepare supper? - Well... - Could you prepare another room? Yes, but it's for your daughter? No, it's for me. For sir? Yes, please prepare one for me separately. Certainly, sir. Aren't you asleep yet? No, when I remember, I can't stop giggling. - About what? - The maid misunderstood - that you and Mr. Kawasaki were a married couple. - Stupid... - It's already late, you have to sleep. - Yes. Look, the moon has risen! It must be fine tomorrow. Good night. Hey, Kaoru. What? What do you want to say, aunt? What do you think about our life? Nothing... nothing in particular. Why? Good night. Darling? What's happening, Akiko? Why are you surprised? It's me. What have you done? Oh, your hands are cold. Would you like to smoke? Here. Akiko... Ma'am... Ma'am...! What are you doing? I can't sleep. I'm not used to this hotel. Mr. Kawasaki? Yes? The matter I told you about, - have you thought about it? - Yes. What do you think? I appreciate your kindness. - Only this? - Yes, this offer was too sudden. And I think, for Kaoru, it's too early for marriage. Do you think it's too early for Kaoru? You haven't thought of it before? In my case, no, not at all. Not at all... There's not the smallest chance? Does your finger hurt? Perhaps you're confused by our proposal? No. - Let's go back to the hotel? - OK. Ma'am. What do you think... about your present life? - My present life? - Yes. About your married life. I'm satisfied. But... why do you ask me about it? You're satisfied... Really. About your youth... My youth? About your youthful days, and your love and marriage. Why do you ask me about them? I can't help asking you. - It may be useless to try. - Useless? To tell the truth, I was thinking from the first day I met you. I... I love my husband. And my husband loves me.. Ma'am! What do you think of a man who is crazy about you? A man without honour... and a high social standing, like your husband. But he trusts to love her more than anyone else. And the man knows quite well that your husband loves you. But he thinks he can love her in his own way and make her happier than anyone else. I suppose he pities me. Pities you? Yes, he feels pity for me. The whisper of a wave confuses him, maybe. I don't feel pity for you, I'm serious. Serious? Ma'am, the man who... is crazy for you is me! What are you talking about? No, it's not right, it's not right. I'm happy... I'm really happy. Please tell me the truth. I never want to cause my husband pain. Ma'am! Then, we don't have any problem. She should have a boyfriend. Yes. Even if I see her as a mother, she is still a child. Only her body has grown up. For Mr. Kawasaki it's normal to get married to a woman your age. - Are you working now? - No, it's not important. I heard you didn't accept the offer. I'm very sorry. I was thinking it was a really good and natural proposal. Of course, I'll respect your opinion. But, it is a pity. As I expected, you can't forget your wife. Or, you are in love with someone? No, I don't have anyone. I'm not in a hurry, but please reconsider. - Professor. - Yes? - I'll visit my wife's grave as I planned. - You mean you're leaving? I'll manage to finish your draft tonight. What's wrong? - Perhaps you're displeased with our offer. - No, it's not that. Then you needn't leave so soon. Sachiko! Sachiko! Yes. - What is it? - Sachiko, he told me he's leaving. - As I said, I'll visit my wife's grave. - Then, there is no reason to leave now. Please ask him. You shouldn't leave now. My husband is really worried about you. No, it's not on account of your offer. Then please stay a few more days. Do you mind staying a few more days? Professor, I'll accept your offer to stay. Oh, very good. For the rest of holiday, don't talk about your marriage and let's have a good time. Did you know, there's a festival tonight. I'll take a walk. I'll continue what I was doing. Mr. Kawasaki! What? Isn't Mr. Kawasaki here? - He's gone out. - I've brought some ointment for his finger. - How was your walk? - It was boring with the rain. - Why are you laughing? - Nothing. But it was so funny, because the hotel maid thought aunt and Mr. Kawasaki were a married couple. - And then? - Nothing. - Uncle, Dr. Horie said to come tonight for the festival. - Really. Again... for this. He's insistent isn't he? - Kaoru! - What? What? What do you think? About what? About Kawasaki. Mr. Kawasaki? I think... he's like a kind brother. Only that? What do you want to say? Because his age is... What? I don't know! Kawasaki, in the 50 years of my life, these five years have been the most beautiful and pleasant. Mr. Kawasaki! Is something wrong? My course of action. Your course? Dr. Horie would like us to celebrate the festival together. - Would you like to come? - Yes. I'm sorry about your offer. No problem. Kaoru is still a child. But she's a really good girl. She's wise and cheerful. Look, Mr. Kawasaki. You've taken something to head, haven't you? It seems so. No, I haven't. Really. But I... trust you. You don't have any good points. Let's drink! Let's drink from a large glass. - You should drink too. - Thank you. - It's too much... - No, no problem. Drink! You're still young. Drink up. I heard you're one of the Professor's pupils. So, please study well, - and be a good successor. - Yes. And you should hurry and get a good wife. She must be young, beautiful, and better than someone you know. Hey, Dr. Horie... You'll call me "persistent". Yes, I know, I'm persistent. But you should follow the Professor's example. Your turn. He remains hale and heady at his age. Please take care of him. - You've drunk too much... - Don't worry. When he has a problem, I'll give him some hormones, vitamins, or whatever. OK, let's go out! - Hey, you! - No, it's too early to leave. Ma'am, I'll take him... your dearest husband. We play all night, I'm sorry. - Please do. - You really don't mind? Kawasaki, why don't you come with us? - I need to work tonight. - Really, then we'll go. - Yes. - Then, let's go! Darling, are you alright? You're really red. Am I, red? Ma'am, if you are kind to him, he must presume on your kindness. - Then, we'll go. - Take care. - Dr. Horie, please take care of him. - OK, and thank you for the dinner. - See you later. - Have a good time. Sachiko! - I'll go and pick up my children. - OK, take care. - I won't be long. - OK. Are you alright? Feel pity? I don't feel pity for you. I'm really serious! Ma'am, please tell me the truth honestly, the truth! Kawasaki Akiko Dr. Horie, it's too big an amount for Mr Kawasaki... Ma'am, please forgive me about that night. I shouldn't have told you like that. Please, forgive me. Mr. Kawasaki, I have... seen your late wife's photo. Ma'am, when I first met you I was momentarily startled. If I had known about you, I probably wouldn't have come here. But the beautiful life of you and the professor makes me realize. I envied you little by little, I felt happy, and at the same time sad. I couldn't control myself at all. I really felt sad that I hadn't been able to treat my late wife more kindly. The memory of her changed to a feeling for love you. It shouldn't have happened. I felt really sorry for the Professor. You didn't know how distressed I am about this. Then finally that night, I lost control of myself. But I shouldn't have told you. I shouldn't have done it. Please forgive me... Ma'am. You still love your late wife. Ma'am, I... I'm happy, I'm really happy... I know it. I wish you happiness for ever. I wish it, whenever and wherever, secretly. Mr. Kawasaki! Please... What do you think about your present life? - About your married life. - Why do you ask me? About your youthful days, your love, and your marriage. You still love... your late wife. - Your late wife!!! - Ma'am! - Ma'am, I... - I'm happy. I'm really happy. What is it, Sachiko? What is it? It's the first time I've seen you like this, since our marriage. What's the matter? Hey, Sachiko. I like to know everything about you. Please tell me. Please tell me everything. Something happened to you, when you went to Shirahama. I'm frightened! You look so stern! Sachiko, why you are suffering? If you're not happy, I'm not happy, either. Darling! Please hold me tight. Please hold me tight, darling. You are a special couple. We should think if the people who depend on the happiness... are happy or not... Good morning. - Good morning. - May I come in? I think I've collected your drafts. Thank you. - Why don't we take a walk? - OK, let's go. Professor, has something happened? I heard... from Sachiko. Of course, she tried to put my mind at rest. And besides, I trust you implicitly. But... Please try to imagine if I lose Sachiko. I... I never want to lose her. Look, I... Professor! I... Wait, please listen to me first. Listen, Kawasaki. It's not easy to say this to you, but, please go home now. From us. No... from Sachiko, please leave, far away from her. Professor, please forgive me my hasty action. No, it doesn't matter if I forgive you or not. It's absolutely my request. It's my request! Hey, Kawasaki, it may be my jealousy that I've never known before... Professor, it's my fault. Only my fault. I... I'm the person you should blame. I... Look, Kawasaki. If we use the word "sin", I also committed a sin bringing you here. And also, Sachiko committed a sin in upsetting you. But, evidently it's not a sin. It's a proof for us of our fate. Please don't surrender to youth, - to youth. - Yes, I'll try to think well about her youth and liberty. Sachiko! Sachiko! What are you doing here? We started talking about some new work. - Right, Kawasaki? - Right. We are thinking about the future. We'll do wonderful work. Isn't that right, Professor? Kawasaki and me. Really... In short, it's about our ideals and our dreams. Yes, that's right. How nice! Please do wonderful work together. Yes. Professor, please take one. Thank you. - I've brought a packet of cigarettes for you... - Thank you. No, I'll give up smoking. - You don't need to do it so suddenly... - I'll give up. Oh, I'm sorry but... I'll go to work at the hotel now. - It's the time to leave. - OK. - It's a lunch box, although I didn't prepare anything special. - Thank you. Ma'am, I may need to stay there 2 or 3 nights. - Mr. Kawasaki. - Yes. - Please take care. - Thank you. You, too. And the Professor seems really tired. Please encourage him. Alright. I hope the professor will continue to do more wonderful work. So, I'll try to support him as much as I can. Thank you in advance. You're welcome. Mr. Kawasaki! Are you going to town? Yes, by the next bus. I'll see you to the bus stop. Me, too. - Mr. Kawasaki. - Yes. - Is it true you're going? - Yes, I am. It seems you won't be returning. I'll see you out. Professor. - Are you going? - Yes, I'm off. - Thank you for everything. - Then, we'll meet again in Tokyo. It's going to be hot, take care. Thank you, too. Kawasaki, please forgive me for letting you go back to Tokyo. No, you shouldn't say that. I couldn't help you at all... I'm reading the book you gave us. I'll finish soon. "Theory of Happiness" by Alain Kawasaki. I trust you implicitly I trust you. Look, Mr. Kawasaki. Our names, Sachiko's and mine, were named to wish us happiness by our late Father. Sachiko and Fukuko. Really. I wish both of you happiness. And Kaoru. Thank you. Look, Mr. Kawasaki... Mr. Kawasaki! Mr. Kawasaki! Look, Mummy! - Look, I caught a really big river crab! - Wow, really big! Mr. Kawasaki, I'll present them to you. They are beautiful... Look! Look! It's really hot in town, take care. Yes. Thank you. I suppose Mr. Kawasaki won't ever come back. He'll never come here again. - Sachiko. - Yes. - What is it? - Let's all go to the sea together later. - Yes. Would you like to smoke? - No, I've given up. - But, once in a while... - Thank you. We should take care of our health, right? THE END
