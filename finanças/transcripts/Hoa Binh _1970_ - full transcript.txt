I know, it's going to be hard for you and the kids. But I have to go. I go. How often did rain take over from the sun since your departure? What's this? A medicine for my leg. I bought it very dear to the Chinese. Maybe it will comfort me. Is it thunder? No, there is no more thunder in Vietnam. There are only planes left. Nothing more. Do you think daddy will come back soon? Yes, very soon. - Why did he leave? - Hold on. I think the rice is cooked. When Dad comes back, you will not have to work anymore. - ุง a will be as before. - Yes, as before. He will be here. I will take care of Xuan. And you, you will go back to school. Xuan was born one morning and I was at school. You too, Xuan, you'll go to school one day. Viewing. She is fine. She took 200 grams. Your radios have arrived. Come see the doctor. You have to admit her to the hospital. This is serious enough. I'm afraid it will not heal. News from your husband? You are very sick. You have to go to the hospital. We will take care of your children. It's impossible. The rice is cooked. I have to go to work. I'm already late. Eat without me. Are you very sick? No do not worry. Tomorrow we will go to the market all three. Then we will go to your cousin Nam. Look, a unicorn. You are hurt? No it is nothing. It's still far away? Yes, quite. My house burned. I lost everything. Can we stay here for a few days? Take care of the children. Hello. You have a lot of pain? A little bit, Hung. The city is far away. I was tired of walking from the village to the market. Why two armies? One day, the other night. Viet-Cong. Go open. We will still have to break the road. Come all, please. Hung, wake up your mother. Come on, everybody outside. You are tired? A little. Quick, the road must be cut before sunrise. Delta to Charlie. Delta to Charlie. To you. You do not go to the market? No, I can not go to work this morning. I can not get up. I have a very bad leg, hung. I have to get treatment. The dispensary nurse will come later and will take me to the hospital. But will you come back? No, I do not think so, my son. But dad will come back. Maybe, but it's not safe. You will stay here. You'll take care of Xuan as a man. I know you'll get there. Please, Hung, go to the clinic. Go get the nurse. She's going to die, it's almost safe. Here is money for the kids. My dear little boy, you will soon learn that life is cruel. When you were born, there reigned light and joy. I remember it very well. So you have to do everything to convey that to Xuan. Only Xuan and you are left. You have to take care of her. Try to always hang on to happiness. Never lose hope. How many mountains and rivers will there be between you? Poor hung. You'll have to take care of Xuan. Your mother will not come back. Hold. That's money to take care of children. You will only have rice. I do not have money for you. But Nam, my dad will be coming back soon. He does not care. He will not come back. We can not stay here. Nobody loves us. There is the city where we lived with mom. She may be at the market. Or at the port. She's waiting for us to be ready for Dad's return. Tomorrow, we'll go get her. Do you wear your father's hat? Hung, come eat soup with your sister. If you want to work, I have a junk to unload. It is not too hard. Come to port tomorrow, on the arroyo. You can make a little money. Do you want to be polite? I rent you a box. Come see me on rue Calmette, tomorrow. Sao. Bay. Hung. Tonight, we share. Okay? Come and wax our shoes. So major, how is it going? This year, we have inflicted heavy losses to Viet Cong and North Vietnamese. They were pushed back to the Cambodian border. And we seized tons of food and ammunition. And the future? We are very optimistic. We are militarily stronger than our enemies. Our official mission is to help Vietnam repel Communist aggression. The democracy of other countries depends on our success. We want peace, not war. But as the war was imposed on us, then we make war. We will stay here until democracy settles. It can take 20 years. Perhaps. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, supported by the Russians and the Chinese, will never accept defeat. They will fight to the end. This is certain, unmistakable. We must not under any circumstances relax our vigilance. The troops of the 36 free nations who are with us know that the Republic of Vietnam has called us to win the fight for freedom. - That's all? - Get out. You do not have to come back tomorrow. Did you take that? As soon as the American car arrives, you will follow me. Here it is. - Your name? - Hung. Watch out. We're going to pee on the car. Swallows succeed geese in the sky. The year ends. What are you doing here? We are resting. My little sister is sleepy. Where do you live? Nowhere. Where are your parents? My mother died in the hospital, my father left. Do you want to come in with your sister? With pleasure. Do you want to sleep here? If it does not bother you. Do not worry about the girl. I am alone, just like you. And the little one needs a roof. You can stay here if you want. I'll take care of her. I will not be able to feed you, you will need a job. And after work, you will come to sleep here. I'll keep you some rice. My name is Tran Thi Ha. And you? My name is Hung and my sister, Xuan. She is sick, she needs care. Do not worry about her. Tomorrow, a nurse will bring me my sulfones. She will examine Xuan. You can sleep next to your sister. She does not need to go to the hospital. We will place Xuan in a nursery. We will take care of Xuan as your mother would have wanted. You can come and see her every night. If you leave the vegetation invade your parents' house and the brambles cover the graves from your ancestors, would you be insensitive to your son in need? Day after day, month after month, year after year. Think and think, believe and believe, wait and wait. This sturdy gold heart and durable stone, near the ocean, it's the mountain of waiting. You're not from here? No, from the city. Let's go talk. Where are your parents? Mom is dead and daddy is gone. Where did your father go? I do not know. But my cousin Nam was saying that it could cause us trouble. When did he leave? Long ago. But when he returns, we will be happy. - Do you want to know where he is? - Yes. Come with me tonight, you'll know it. Maybe you can even help him. Comrades. This year, more than 200,000 puppet government soldiers were put out of action. 43 battalions and 4 motorized squadrons destroyed. We will vanquish undoubtedly because we have a superiority on our enemies, from the political point of view. The revolution is an uprising, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another. The regime of our state is a dictatorship popular. We want peace, not war. But war can only be abolished by war. And to defeat rifles, it is necessary to use other rifles. The war has begun to remove obstacles which hinder political development. As long as the obstacle is not raised, the war must continue. Twenty years, if necessary. Yes, twenty years. The imperialists and their valets, the reactionaries, will never accept defeat. They will fight to the end. This is certain, unmistakable. We must not under any circumstances relax our vigilance. Leave it to be 20 years old. The world is progressing, the future is bright. It is impossible to change this course of history. Our soldiers must always keep in mind this essential observation: We are the great People's Liberation Army. We are sure of victory. When you have contacted our 3 chiefs in Saigon, your mission will be completed. Before coming back, go see your wife and your two children. Sorting! Never forget that we fight for a better world. I have nothing to tell you. Since you left them, we paid and worked for you. Your wife killed herself at work. She is dead. You hear? Dead. I already have enough worries with my children. Yours left weeks ago. I do not know where they are. But at the clinic, they must know it. The doctors could not save your wife. And they surely could not keep the children. I only want peace and tranquility. You are going to bring us the police. Go away. I am the husband of Cao Thi Thu. I knew you would come. Follow me. This is Cao Thi Thu's husband. Do not be afraid. Exhaustion or grief did not cause his death. She was doomed. Your wife died of a very rare disease. We did everything we could, but we have been powerless. His sarcoma in the leg had become widespread. You hear? Dead. And they surely could not keep the children. Go see your wife and your two children. Never forget that we fight for a better world. Your son works during the day. But he comes every night to see Xuan. Your son works during the day. But he comes every night to see Xuan. Ms. Ngoan will take you to see Xuan. It's been a long time since you left. But she will quickly recognize her dad. Say, dad, what is peace? Subtitling: DUBBING BROTHERS
