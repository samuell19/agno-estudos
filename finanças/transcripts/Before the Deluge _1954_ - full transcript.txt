All the people in the story you are about to see are imaginary. In telling an exceptional story, the film-makers were not painting a general picture of French youth, nor showing that racial prejudice is becoming more widespread in France. Happily, such a drama has never taken place, but in the conditions evoked by the film, it might happen... and it is in that spirit that it is submitted for your consideration. Defendant, have you any last words to say in your defence? Nothing, Your Honour. No, Your Honour. - No, Your Honour. I want to say, Your Honour, that the witnesses and my defence lawyer, have been arguing that my role in the case was separate. No, I was part of the group, with Richard, with Philippe, with Jean. And I ask to be judged with them. That's all I wanted to say. The arguments are concluded. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have 33 questions for your deliberations. Nine questions concerning Richard Dutoit: is he guilty of breaking and enterring? Of complicity in the manslaughter of a nightwatchman? Did he murder his colleague Daniel Epstein? He is 17 years old. Nine questions concerning Philippe Boussard: they are the same. He is 17 years old. Only seven questions concerning Jean Arnaud, but two are different. Was he at the manslaughter of the nightwatchman? Was he an accomplice to the murder of his friend Daniel Epstein? He has just turned 17. Eight questions concern Liliane Noblet. Was she an accomplice in the theft, the manslaughter, the murder? She isn't yet 17 years old. Guards, escort the defendants out. The trial is suspended. The jury goes to make its deliberation. The facts are clear, and nobody can contest the elements that constitute the drama that occurred in 1950, at a specific moment in time and now already nearly forgotten, when the outbreak of the Korean conflict almost provoked a world war. The defendants were minors so the case was being heard in camera. Only the parents had attended the deliberations. And while the fate of their children was played out, each of them was obsessed by their memories, each asking themselves about their own responsibility. In this way, Albert Dutoit was recalling that faraway day of the Occupation when he was listening again to 'Valkryie' at the Opera. The first trumpet a little less detached, please. Maestro, that would be hypocritical. How's that? The Valkryies look at the warriors, the soldiers, this is emphasised by the intervention of the trumpet by Wagner. The German soldiers die. The intention should be respected. What we are playing is not Wagner. Mr. Dutoit, the legend of the Valkryies is Scandinavian. You are giving, on your trumpet, your personal interpretation. Pianissimo, please. Maestro, the theme is Scandinavian, but Wagner was German by his blood and in his heart. Through his work, Germany is saluting its heroes. I am interpreting the score, and I'm playing fortissimo. I could disagree... but if you insist, so be it. Gentlemen, two beats before number 39. I wasn't going to cry, but I'm so happy. Where is your mother? Mummy is exhausted. Nothing serious, but she was worried she might get over-emotional. You have a cigarette? - Of course. In the last five years, how many times I thought of my first puff... in freedom! It's good. Give me your suitcase. - It's full of dynamite. Seven notebooks. My trial, my defence, with proof of their machinations. And all that I have suffered because of them during the last 5 years. It's all over. The prison, but the opera, the conservatory, the concerts, that's all over too. And when one knows nothing but playing the trumpet, when one is 50 years old what is there left to hope for? Mummy's working, I'm working as well. Richard, I've spent five years sitting on a stool, trying to understand what I was accused of. It was not a crime of interpreting Wagner, in a way that pleased the orchestra chief from Cologne, and who invited me to Bayreuth, who sent me to play in a POW camp. Where is the wrong-doing? What they say in the newspapers doesn't concern me. I have begun to understand what's important during 5 years in prison... 10 years of national humiliation. Suddenly, I see things clearly. Richard, it was the Jews who made us weak. Why the Jews? Because it's what the evidence shows. Wagner hated the Jews. So... they must be condemned because I love Wagner. Look, see the prison where your father suffered. And never forget this. I was betrayed by the Jews, condemned by the Jews. Richard, never forget this. The house hasn't been lived in for 5 years, but it's in a good condition. This is where the Boussards were born, where they died. And they enjoyed it here. My wife and I prefer Paris. It's the land that interests my client. 110 hectares, excellent for beetroot. Who is your client? Excuse me, but... You must be cautious because of your commission? You don't know me. Down to earth, old chum... a realist. We should do business together. Come, I have a meeting with my steward. We're not working? The workers come a long way, and they are asking 30 Francs for their travel. 30 Francs? If the sugar goes up, they'd still be protesting. In my opinion, they are justified, but I wanted to speak to you. They're waiting on your decision. With crossed arms, obviously. Five minutes, please. You can continue your rest. The answer in 5 minutes. You're annoyed at the workforce? They know that it's not me who'll be planting the beetroot. Good equipment, huh? I don't cheat at modernisation. But the land is excellent. Don't you think so anymore? The way the east wind blows doesn't inspire much confidence. 12 million, you won't find a better deal. You have a yacht to buy? - They want 15 million. You aren't the only one to understand the drawbacks of property when we want to take ourselves and cross over the ocean. You're not so bad, Montessan. - Thank you. I want to make you a proposition: all this Boussard land for that boat. I play fair. I agree. The exodus, I remember, the caravan just before Spain, begging for a bed, some respite, and the bridge crossed on foot carrying the suitcase. The Boussard silverware is heavy. And a kilo of gold, Philippe, that weighs heavily. When there are 20... If it all starts up again, we'll flee to Cannes and on to Africa. You really believe that people want a war? It is unavoidable. But in our case, the main thing is that we are ready. Do you know what my husband immediately installed on the yacht? A safe? - A large one. That boat is primed to flee to the Zulus, I hate it. I must see you in that boat. I wouldn't talk of it so badly. And if there is a war... Women would rather talk about something else. Men, also. But the politicians and the financiers don't know where we're heading. Trust them, it'll end in disaster. So, Serge, what should we cling to? Everyone has the duty to think only of his happiness. Francoise, I have always looked for a most beautiful and rare woman, most intelligent. A woman like you. But... I am married, Serge. I have a son. A husband who thinks only of saving his fortune. A son who is already a man. You can do no more for them. They leave you alone more and more. Francoise, think of yourself. The deluge will perhaps be tomorrow. Think of yourself, Francoise. What's the point of the Constitution? For peace, tear up your passports! Tear up your I.D. papers! Group of pigs! We'll screw you! In the name of peace and respect for the human person. Your name and status. Marcel Noblet, member of the League for Human Rights, qualified teacher and lecturer at the Victor Hugo School. And you insulted the police? To get them to respect that the meeting was legitimate. Your papers. I live at Reuil-Malmaison, 21 Rue Pasteur. I don't seem to have my I.D. papers, but you can call my home Malmaison 62-11, where you'll find my children who can confirm it. When you protest on the public way, when you defy the public authorities, and without papers of course, you face these sorts of inconvenences. I am very absent-minded. My children will tell you. It was 62-11? - In Malmaison, yes. No answer. It's gone midnight, it's impossible that they're not there. It may be impossible, but that's how it is. How old is your daughter? - 16 years old. It's all very well to agitate for a global republic, but it's necessary to be aware what's going on in your home. A girl of 16, it's wrong that at 0:35am you don't know where she is. I'm tired. Can we sit down? I haven't even been able to offer you a drink. I'm not thirsty. You're never thirsty, you never want to go to the cinema. You are terrific! No, I like being being with you, talking with you. As for the riverbank or a cafe, I prefer the riverbank. It's something, for once, that doesn't cost anything. Never having a dime, it's humiliating, you know. At home, you should see how it is. To get out of it, dad said he's going to become a pork butcher. Whose going to pay for the trumpet lessons of his children? You laugh, but I'm getting tired of it. It'll take me eight years to become a teacher. If there hadn't been the war... But during those eight years, you can publish books. Liliane, instead of writing books telling our hopeless lives, going over again all the reasons why we should split up, wouldn't the really brave thing be to go away? Where to, Richard? Where everything's new, the people and the buildings. If I fled to Canada, or to Australia, would you come with me? It doesn't matter where. I'm going to go to the consulates. There are thousands who've already signed on. But to leave, we must have money. I don't have a dime. Where is your sister? - I haven't a clue. What time did you come in? Late. I was at a lecture about Marx and Lenin. It was superb. I'm writing up my notes. - Without asking yourself where your sister is? At the film club... Did you know that Lenin foresaw... Not tonight, please. From time to time, try to remember that you have a sister who lost her mother She refused to join the Young Communists. That's not attractive. Everyone has their tastes. The capitalist system... I'm talking to you about Liliane. Youngsters are confused by the internal contradictions... I'm asking you where your sister might be at one o'clock in the morning. The last Paris train departs at 1.12am. I'm going to wait in her room. Daddy, what are doing here? - I was waiting for you to say good night. That's nice of you, but... We've reached a point where I'm starting to worry about you. I didn't hear you open the front door. This evening, I... I returned by the kitchen window. Secretly? You've returned at the same time before? Because I don't have a key, and you won't give me one because I'm too young You know that you aren't old enough to go out alone at night, and you do it anyway. Why? In the beginning, it was because I was bored. You were at your meetings... - You said "in the beginning". And now? - I often go out with Richard Dutoit. You know him? Where did you meet him? Here. You were interested in Richard because of his intelligence. You leant him some books. One evening, he returned them. You were at a meeting. And this boy, obviously, starting courting you. Richard and I love each other. Liliane, how old are you? Daddy, is there a right age to love very much someone who also loves you very much? And where do you two go? We walk around the streets. When we're tired, we sit together on a bench. And what do you do on this bench? We talk. Then you return through the kitchen window and read this. Crime thrillers, they're funny. Liliane, I confess I'm unnerved. In any event, I'm trying to understand. I'm trying to be an enlightened teacher. I want also to be an enlightened father. With your brother, the difficult one, those are his opinions. With you, it's something else. Come here. There is a trust between us that we must preserve. You asked me, I answered you. Yes, you had reasons to go out. And I'm only trying to save you from some foolishness. You go out, all the same. Lili, I want to trust you. From now on... this key will be under the doormat. I want to trust you. I want to be an enlightened father. By any chance, Mrs. Arnaud, do you have a lemon half? A lemon half? - Between neighbours. Here's a whole lemon. I'm not dressed yet. I see. And don't you find it cold? I'm used to it. The doctors say... Of course. But there are people in the house. You mean your son? When I meet him, he lowers his eyes. He is shy. He's well brought up. I would ask you, miss... I'll not refuse whatever you ask me, but call me Josette, like everyone else. Miss Josette, when you undress in the evening, be so kind as to close the curtains first. It's an oversight. If you think the opposite, I'd prefer to return the lemon. No, keep the lemon and close your curtains. Thanks again. Mrs. Arnaud. Daniel? I thought it was Jean. If I'm too early... - Oh no. It's Jean who's always late. I brought you some flowers. - Oh Daniel. I am very angry and happy. If you resume... Come in. What's happening in Korea? Nothing good. The United Nations are going to intervene. If the conflict spreads... I won't sleep well worrying about Jean. My uncle lives in New York. His letters are very pessimistic. Roses. That's too extravagant. He's sent me some panicky letters, but also some nice dollars. I am very touched to be received by you. When one lives alone... You don't have any parents here? They were all deported, I never saw them again. How old were you? - Nine. Some fantastic people hid me on their farm. I didn't understand any of it. When you're little, it's hard to grasp that you belong to an impure race. It's also hard when you're big. Here's Jean... on Patrick's motorbike, of course. Beaten the record. It flies like there's a fire in the arse. They whistled you twice. - My father will take care of it. Have you gone crazy? - I'm greeting your mother. So she'll get mad at me? If you meet Josette, give her the eye for me. With the hello of an amateur. He's rude. Do you know that Patrick? A little. - Slovenly and sure of himself. An image he puts on, but he's ready to help out. I dislike him. - You're too severe. When it's about Jean, my instincts don't desert me. I'll go see to the soup. My fuses have blown. I'm late. Electricity scares me. I'll probably electrocute myself! I'm sorry but they're waiting for me. - So hurry along. It would never do to keep mummy waiting. You know what time it is? Always with that Patrick who rides like a lunatic. I've told him to be careful. - We'll talk about it again. Daniel is here. Sit yourselves at table. I'm late, it wasn't my fault. You're making a face. - You had to go skating? It was all wrapped up in a thing. You'd rather hang out with Patrick. You must chose between me and him. You're a pain in the neck with your jealousies. If I'm a pain in the neck with my jealousies, you're a pain with your betrayals. My betrayal, going skating? - It's everything that you do without me. Not at table yet? - We were waiting for you. You could have tidied yourself. I was talking about Patrick with Daniel. Despite the praises he was giving... - He was praising Patrick? He's a good comrade, isn't he? - Yes, of course. I don't like the influence he's having on you. I have decided to change your school. You'll go to Victor Hugo with Daniel. When it's about Jean, my instincts don't desert me. I don't like you messing with my papers. I'm disturbing them as little as possible. I can't find my own. Have you seen that article on the peace meeting? Appalling. - You're not in favour of peace? Not yours that is on offer. We propose peace for all peoples. We prefer our plan. Your peace, it's anarchy. - Yours is enslavement. The games of the reactionaries! Spare the insults. It is me who is more left-wing. The leftist who marches with rightist military commanders! Traitors. - When you speak to your father... I'm speaking to a extremist. If you want peace... I'm also speaking to an extremist. It's like this every day now. He called me a reactionary. - And he called me an idiot. You're always talking about the war. Today, of the peace. - The dress is annoying me. What is that disguise? I wanted to make a dress. I didn't have any money to spend. Where did you get these papers? - They are old ones. My sources! Have you gone mad? Give them back. - Daddy! Give some peace to your sister. - But those are my papers. For once, all that prose serves some purpose... You pretend to respect our ideas? - I was joking. The day when the treason of socialists... The bad faith of communists. - The politics of renunciation. Stop or I'll jump out the window. Don't talk so foolishly. I won't do it, but I am going to live elsewhere. A dunce has come for tuition. Go to your room. Liliane? - Yes? Is it very long since you've bought yourself something? Yes, daddy. Forgive me, I am a little ashamed, but... At the end of the month, I promise you. And we'll talk no more of politics. You swear? - No, but we'll talk about it less. Go on, go. My compliments. You are ten minutes late. If it's only 10... You have finished your dissertation? I tried, but it wouldn't come. - Letter from Diderot to Voltaire where he announced the publication of the first volume of his Encyclopedia. This doesn't inspire you? The Encyclopedia marks a great date in the history of thought. Don't smile. A date that moves us. Perhaps, but it doesn't move me. When your parents made the sacrifice for extra tuition... We might ask why. Daddy is in big business, in two years he will train me. Who cares about Voltaire and Diderot? I prefer skating. A businessman ought to have an education in the classics. When speculating on land, hide your money where the tax authorities can't find it. The way you talk about your father's affairs... And if you skated less? Three men from the Anti-Fascist Committee are asking for you. I'll be 5 minutes. There is reading on my desk. With daddy, 5 minutes can be longer. He was telling me off, so... Politics? I have no political opinions. Philippe Boussard. The teachers' lament. There are students good at maths, at geography... I'm useless at everything. You're having trouble with your bac? - No hope at all on that front. While others are getting ready for their exams, I'm getting my parents ready. No ambitions? - They are not in the programme. I want to travel, see the underwater life in the Coral Sea. Is that nice car outside yours? Yes, it's mummy's motor. She lends it to me. Competition engine. She can make 160. You fancy a spin? Another time. I have a meeting at 6pm with Richard Dutoit. Where are you meeting? At Molitor. We'd be going past the woods. We can make the rounds 5 times. You could drop me at Molitor? Dutoit's a friend. I'm straight-up. 5.58pm. I kept my word? You're not coming in? - If that would be okay with you. Why not? We'll tell him what happened. Whisky? - No, it's too expensive. Don't worry. Barman! Telephone message for you. Richard... he cannot come. He has some trouble at home. What trouble? - I didn't ask him that. Two whiskys, Scotch. - Very good, sir. Would you like me to take you over to his place? The trouble is bound to be with his father. - I know. My father is almost the same. A background in concrete. But it's less serious than playing Wagner. And long live the underwater fish. - In the Coral Sea. Shall we have dinner together? - Where? Wherever you like. I'm not trying to take advantage of the situation with Mr. Dutoit. But there's nothing we can do about it. A car is going to retrieve all this. I found a maid's room. For the three of us? It's at a friend's. Set aside what you need. - And for clothes? And food? For this evening, we must first get a room. Afterwards, we'll see. Mr. Dutoit. Please. Good. Do it. Commissioner, don't you understand that this is a plot? A plot? The walls have ears. With their crooked hands, with their crooked noses, they are watching me. My landlord is kicking me out because he's marrying his son to a "Chavkine". - There is a court order. Signed by who? Judge Silberman. It all fits! You haven't paid your rent for three years. Pretext, a bad pretext. They first plotted to prevent me from succeeding in life. And now, they're taking my apartment. What's next? If you paid your rent, like everyone else... Am I like everyone else? They've set me apart, on the margins. And... first in the plot with them, would you dare tell me your name? Alfred Marcelin, born in Ardeche, of a Breton father and a mother from Auvergne. Oh commissioner, if the Brittany and Auvergne are with them, would you tell me where France is going? Elegance, comfort and distinction. If your mother finds me here... - She's dining in town. Admire the dressing table with its creams invented to recreate youthfulness. Funny and deeply moving. - How old is your mother? The age when they start looking at their sons with consternation. Philippe, it's not normal. You want to know what a nightclub is like? Then you need a dress. A coat. You want to pick one? - I wouldn't dare. By midnight, it'll need to be back in the wardrobe. You're turning my head. - After three whiskys? So many unexpected things have happened to me. Agreeable things? - Yes. So why refuse? Here's the shoe shelf. Here, the stockings. They came from America. The most beautiful in France, apparently. I've seen things like these, but never touched them. Well, take advantage then. Come on, hurry up and get dressed. Liliane, you're an amazing girl! Edouard! Kind heart, light of my youth! Could you lend me 10,000 Francs? - I don't have them. You've spent a lot of money? - I've bought some land. Every month, I send 30,000 Francs to the lawyer. It's all the more meritorous when you earn 25. The cook is buying the land too? No, she's gone out. Madame is dining out with her aunt. Edouard, you have saved my life. When mummy dines with her aunt, she's never in the mood to deny me anything. Every evening, I've wanted to dine with you. But you always pull out, that's been upsetting me. You are married. Yes, I know. But remember, at the start, when you told me... What did I tell you? - Oh! You also used to write to me. All this about things I said and wrote is annoying me. Don't get irritated, Serge. You bring me a happiness that I never hoped for. And when you promised me... - Again? Good evening, mummy. Sir. My usual banker has defaulted. I don't have any money. How did you find me? - I have the skills of a detective. I've invited a girl who has nothing out to dinner with me. This is all that I have. - If you'll allow me... No, please. - We're hungry. This young lady is pretty? Ravishing. She's the daughter of one of my teachers. It's good preparation for your bac. Where are you taking her? To a nightclub. Can you recommend a good one? Here. We wouldn't want to inconvenience you. - You have our word. It would be amusing, eh? Go get her. I'd like to, but she doesn't have a dress. I have already selected one of yours. - Charming. She also has a cape picked out. - Ah! Don't leave that young lady alone, that would never do. Very well. Happy diversion from a conversation that was irritating you. It'll be better, it'll get your son on our side. Philippe. it's very embarrassing. At our age, we don't chicken out. Come on. Mummy, here is Liliane Noblet. Mr. de Montessan. That dress looks very good on you. - I am most confused. It's essential to encourage contempt for our conventions in youth. And this evening couldn't begin under better auspices. It's essential to encourage contempt for our conventions in youth. We are neighbours. This isn't any sort of a detour. Besides, Philippe had had too much to drink. And to trust him with a car, with you inside... What is Philippe to you? A friend. Beware of kids. Once upon a time, young girls had time to waste. These days, to get the most from life, they must hurry up. Tomorrow, there will perhaps be no luxury, nor pleasure. And you want to help me hurry up? Here we are. Why have we stopped? We have come to my place for a nightcap. I've had too much to drink. I have a secret for a drunken head. It's very attractive at my place. There are paintings, statues... Illustrated books... A sensational stamp collection. Philately at 2am on my own with a man, no thank you. Liliane, is it my fault if I find you so attractive? Don't start pawing me. You have a way with words. You don't find me attractive? I hardly know you, and I love someone else. Every woman loves a little someone. I never realised until tonight how much I love him. You are his mistress? - No. Another kid. You are making plans for when you're grown-up? For when he is famous. - In how many years? Anyone can say: "Apres moi, le deluge". Here it is, the deluge. And this is a reason to sleep with you? I offer what pleases me. - I'm going to scream. There are no neighbours. And my gardeners are old. Please, don't be frightened. If you like getting slapped, carry on... Forgive me. The prettiest girls are not always the most intelligent. I'll take you back. - I'm walking home. It's 4 kms. - That's fine by me. I can't let you return alone. - It's less dangerous than with you. If you think I'm going to start begging you... Liliane! What's going on? A test to see if the sirens are still working. Next week, they'll be testing their funeral proceedings. That's a reassuring thought. This is giving me a heavy heart - It's an exercise. A war could last for 4 years. I have stocked up. And if there isn't a war? It's coming, Jean. A mother isn't wrong about these things. Nobody will able to take shelter... We must try, even so. I agree with your aunt: they aren't going to bomb a hamlet of 43 inhabitants. At the first alert, we will leave for Givrey. It's not very exciting. We'll go together. - And my studies? I have plans ready to take care of us down there. There will be time for work, for reading books, for walks... You think of everything. - I have to. The proof. If a catastrophe occurs, can we bring Daniel? With us? I don't have the supplies. Everyone for themselves. Daniel is my friend. - It's asking too much. Patrick displeases you as well. Funny, this need to have friends. Do I have any, me? We will leave, just the two of us, when I decide. I have my sources. If we bomb China, it will mean world war. Well, we aren't bombing China. But if it happens? I'm giving a warning. In Dakar, I have landed property. You will be so kind as to bring my shirts. If things take a turn for the worse, the unprepared will arrive by steamer. I would like to be in place to receive them. Why won't you come? - I can't stand the heat. Africa will make me 10 years older. - Your coquettery could cost you dear. What's left of my youth is my fortune. I'm like you: I'm safeguarding it. Whisky? - Gladly. Louis XIV in all his glory, making Europe tremble. Your father gave it to me for a 5 cent stamp. It lacks a French cedilla. There were quickly withdrawn from circulation. An era when we exchange a work because of a spelling mistake, what does this tell us? You have lots of them? For panic-stricken customers who want to sell their tapestries, I offer the money that they prefer. You're not panicking? War or not, heads or tails. I play on the false alerts. I buy. At half-price? They can't wait for their packet-boat, those who sell their dining-room tapestries. Nothing will change your mother's mind. She's afraid that there are no hairdressers in Dakar. Here's the stamp. Five centimes. - But no cedilla. Pity that my faults don't have the same value. Your mother is going to take care of you. You keep an eye on her too. You are making me head of the family. - That's it! Always ask yourself what your father would have done. Education, it's the example. If things go badly, flee via Cannes with your mother The yacht is there. I'll be waiting for you. My uncle did not want to stop. On Ki-Wi island. there were no hotels. But it was the most beautiful. With waterfalls, birds, flowers and amazing fish. Here, this record is a little like the music of the fishermen. Nothing to say? This hasn't put me in the mood to talk, but to dream. This isn't a dream. This island exists exactly in the place indicated on the map. Hello, it's me. Sorry, I don't understand. When do I wish to depart for New York? We have been advised that a ticket has been booked in your name. A state of emergency has been declared in the USA. Tell us when you wish to depart. I haven't decided anything. I didn't even know... I'll get back to you. It must be your uncle. - He has been sending over-excited letters. They are very supportive of a crusade. What're you going to do? You see me becoming a flier over there and returning to liberate you with the Atomic Bomb? Mummy's been talking already of the Massif Central. I'm not going without you. You are nice. But the Massif Central is no answer for me. I'm Jewish. This will be turned against us. There's no reason to. There's never any reason to, but that's how it always ends up. To escape this madness, it's not enough to maintain the vague desire of going. Jean, we must wish it with all our strength, to go far, very far away and go together. But go where? To that happy island where to be happy is all anyone wants. You want a whisky? No, when I get home my mother will smell it, know I've been drinking and work out where I've been. Then I'll have to lie to her. Come up with some story of what I was doing in your room... I've had a key made so you can come when you want. Take it. It's English, the Gloucester Meteor. - The fastest in the world. You must choose between the Americans and the Russians. If the Russians arrive, you'll wet yourself. The Breton Resistence is ready. - They'll be everywhere. With assassinations, kidnappings, and, to finish off, a nice little purge. Yes, and the enemies won't get away like they did last time. What are you suggesting? - Do I need to draw you a picture? They are ahead of the main bout. We'll continue this outside. - Wherever you like. Warning by President Truman. Liliane Noblet. - That's me. I'm a comrade of Richard's. He's been in a fight in school. He's been hurt? - Not badly, it's his clothes. He didn't want to come in rags. He's waiting for you at mine. I have my car. Enter, this is an authorised visit. My poor thing. - The first casualty of the war. Daniel told you how it happened? Almost. Whisky for everyone? And make mine a large one! At the start, there were three of them. They were more sorry than me. Show her my jacket. Savages. One of them struck me full in the face. Philippe booted him in the arse. - They called me a traitor to communism. Daniel and Jean took me to the pharmacists. He doesn't like it when we thank him. Daniel was even nice when I made a face at him. A stupid prejudice. Because I am Jewish? I ask your forgiveness. We should shake hands. Now, we are friends. Three friends. - Four. If you'll accept me, we're five. Your mother works as a cleaner because of the Jews. And I'm making the soup... because of the Jews. And you're friends with a Jew? - Epstein is nice. But he's called Epstein. Pointless to ask who lent you those. Daniel is very intelligent. - Don't insult your father. Can I help? Recent history has made me into a cook, but even cooks have their pride. We don't mess with their cooking. If you speak again of Daniel... - There are good Jews. That little phrase you said has done humanity great harm. There are not. There are some who may seem to be so, and they are the most dangerous. The more I meet them, the more I am surprised by their generosity. He takes your hand, and you already have gangrene. I've cut myself. Badly? Don't use the tea-towel. Pass me a proper one. In the trunk. I cut myself because of the Jews. When I was going to prison, I made you swear to be cautious. Richard, break with Epstein. Otherwise, believe your father, one of these days he'll betray you. Why hasn't Daniel come? He's taken pity on us. He's gone out for some cigarettes to give us some time together. He's left us his island. Look around us. The sea and palm trees everywhere. Listen, we can hear the singing of the fishermen. When there's a good catch, the girls dance. With flowers in their hair. It's a long way from Paris. Swear to me that we'll go. I picked this mandarin for you. Here all the fruits belong to everyone. In Paris, at the grocers, they say: "the house does not accept credit". My dear, there are many words which will seem strange to us: "stick no bills", "one-way street"... "Rent" "seizure". - "Meeting", "arrested". "Misery", "unemployment". - "Flying saucer", "atomic bomb". These are words we hear all the time. We'll hear them no more. We should answer? Daniel might be awaiting a message. - Worse, it might be him. Hello? No. Stop the record. It's for who? Oh, is it you, Richard? I wanted to warn Daniel of some news. Well, this gets better and better. I'll tell Daniel to call you. Good night, mate. The Chinese have given another ultimatum to Truman. If the Americans don't evacuate Formosa... - Enough! Liliane, if it was up to me... Don't say any more. Hold me tight. Francoise, have you understood? Between Dakar and Paris, it's not enough to shout to make yourself heard. As for business, things are going very well. I've met with both civilians and the military here. For once, they agree. It'll kick off next week. People have said that before. Yesterday, a deputy reassured me. Reassurance, it's what they do. You must leave on the yacht. It's the most convenient way to bring the most with you. Above all, don't bring the domestics. There's no shortage here of people who can cook beans. Buckle up the suitcases, or I'm going to get angry. Francoise, telegraph when you are embarking. I kiss you. You understood? - I can guess. It's going down next week. - And daddy wants us back? He doesn't understand why I'm hesitating. Daddy isn't so naive. It's hard for me to explain. The ground has been prepared. Us two, aren't we still friends? Yes. It's even the time to be more so than ever. Your father leads a life very separate to mine with much wrong on my part. Today, he knows very well what's keeping me here. He ignores my attachment... elsewhere. And "elsewhere", we are staying until he arrives? This is why I'm not leaving, until he arrives. And if the worst happens? Philippe, we had a nice row about all that. We know that one day we'll be defeated, and afterwards... there will be nothing left. Therefore, if they make a war, drown the world in fire and blood, I don't have a choice. I go where he goes, and I stay where he is. I'm more afraid of losing him than all the rest. Then I'm not leaving. If things go downhill, your father will ask for you, and me too. The yacht is there for that. It's my gift to you. You're giving me the yacht? - Yes. Mummy, really? Dad, are you busy? I'm making my appeal to the worldwide conscience. You could help me. The League made an effort: 5,000 copies for France, 1,500 for overseas. Fold these, it'll speed things up. 1,500 people upset by my appeal can prevent the war. Daddy, there must always be trust between us. More than ever. You have something to tell me? When mummy died, did she leave me a little money? Very little. For when your brother and you were ill, for holidays, for propaganda as well... There's nothing left. - I've given it to you. There is a bag with two small pearls that I was going to give you on your 18th. Why do you want money? I may not hide anything from you? It's not that, but you're making me worried. Why, Lili? Richard, Daniel, Jean, Philippe and me, if war breaks out, are going to Ki-Wi island. It's a Polynesian island. We have a yacht. Liliane, tell me that I'm dreaming. This is a pipedream. Daddy, can you swear to me, swear to your students, that in spite of your appeals to conscience, there will be no war? I dare not. Daddy, what will you do? - I'm staying here. I'll continue to struggle to bring men back to wisdom. In a cave with a Roneo? Or from prison, without a Roneo. Calling for wisdom from prison. Until my final breath. And what will you do to protect me, againt all the violence, all the misery? Well, leaving, even if it is just an adventure, it is less foolish. But at your age, leaving with four boys, with Richard, do you realise the danger? What danger, dad? Nature is such that it's bound to end badly. What "badly"? You see, Liliane, you are no longer a child. Exactly. I am no longer a little girl. What are you saying? Liliane, look at me. Liliane, am I to understand that... I want to hide nothing from you. It's better that you know. It's unbelievable. It's insane. You said that it was in nature. When it's in your own family, it's something else. Dad, you've always acted the enlightened father. Here is your recompense. - You call this a recompense? I am happy. Isn't this the most beautiful gift I could give you? Don't say any more. Let me think. Daddy, I didn't want to hurt you, but you married mummy 3 months before Jean-Jacques was born. When you were young, you had dreams with your friends of founding a distant, enlightened settlement. All my ideas on love, liberty, collective effort, they are yours. Daddy, everything that you've told us, was it only words? No, but it was mainly directed at your brother. And I didn't realise that it was you who was listening. Fathers always imagine that it is their sons who are going to carry on. In my case, it's my daughter. The score of 'Maitres chanteurs' in German. It's the original edition, signed by Wagner. It's all that I could find. - Everyone has done their best. A secondhand 4CV. We need to raise 400 notes. Maintain the yacht before Dakar. The gift from Boussard. Good for 100kg of beans and 200 packets of noodles. Stodgy stuff, but it'll do the job. A ring. It's worth 15,000F. It's definitely a keepsake. I say that we refuse it. It's my mother's keepsake, but... Who wants that Liliane looks after this ring on her hand? Unanimous. Keep it. Oh! You are kind! With all this, we aren't going to get further than Dakar. I've added it all up. For two sailors, to live, fuel oil and all we'll need to take, requires at least 3 million. We'll never raise that. Then our plan is nothing but a dream. So, if there's a war, we're staying here? No, we're leaving. Daniel is right. I've been bent over the problem. I am going to propose to you a practical, amusing, moral solution: we'll pinch Montessan's stamps. Bravo! - Just what I was thinking. Punish a scoudrel to revenge paternal honour! It's meritorious and there's no risk. Jean and I don't understand. Montessan is a scumbag. He lives in a deserted location, in an isolated villa. Here, near the entrance, is the gardener's pavilion, with a gardener and his wife. - Old-timers. At the back is another door. We'll enter this way. And what if the gardener leaves his pavilion? I'll take care of him with this. Don't be an idiot. One word and I'll fire. Is it loaded? - It's loaded. The proof. If the gardener appears, he'll have nothing more to fear than you. Listen to my scenario, where everyone has a role to play. The first to enter will be Liliane... The other night, when I was left to walk home alone, did you know that you did me a great favour? The walk brought thinking with it. It was 4 kms. At first, I was calling you every name. Then, I started to find myself a little silly. And then, I thought about your deluge, you were perhaps right. In the end, I found it incredible that you were interested in me. I was waiting for you, sure that you would return one day. How have you come to understand women so well? It's a gift. To your 16 years. And your future big man? Since our meeting, I've been finding him a little wan. You, at least, know how to talk to the young. I'm overwhelmed. Shall we dine together? Yes, but... not here. Forgive me, I am familiar with women of the world. You deserve more consideration. Would St-Germain please you? - Providing there is dancing. Of course. And you will bring me directly back? Directly. I swear to you. Boussard has advised me to talk to you about a very special business opportunity. I'm leaving tomorrow for Mexico and I have on me a considerable sum that I would like to off-load. You get my drift? Yes, I hear you. A bore. You have lovely legs. To prevent indiscreet questions about this sum, I want to buy a rare stamp. Boussard has told me about a French 5 centime stamp without a cedilla. It's an item like no other. How much is this sum? I want to offer you a stamp from Venezuela, with the image of a very short-lived president. It was quickly withdrawn from circulation. If it interests you, we should perhaps meet. If you're leaving tomorrow, I don't see how we can. This evening? One moment. You can give me until what time? 11pm is the absolute latest. My father is very strict. Can you be at Cacatoes Bar at midnight? The barman knows me. Ask for me. It's never too late to help a friend of Boussard's. Thank you. Until later, dear sir. That must have been a woman. A client. You expect me to believe that you conduct business in a bar at midnight? I'll explain it to you one day, when you are vey nice. And like all wise children, you have the right to a pretty picture. What sort of picture? It's a surprise. For the first evening you dine here. Are you ready? - Fetch my coat. I have the talents of a magician. What would you say if your coat was replaced by a fur coat? I would say bravo. Daddy wouldn't say the same thing. Well played, Liliane. - I have a bad feeling. Stay here and make an owl's hoot if anyone comes. Cigarette? It'll pass the time. The radio. For once, it's a good invention. Stay while I find the window. It should be over there. I'm going. Don't worry, I'll keep a look-out. Put your hands up. One word or movement and I shoot. I have two children. - Back up. I told you to back up. Quiet! Come here. Don't be scared. Check if he's armed. Go on, he won't bite. You were right. Is it loaded? - Yes. Point it at him. I'm busy with the gardener. Don't move, please, don't move. Well? - I've got it. There's a snag. Serious? - No, but we mustn't panic. Idiot! What was that? Someone's there? Help! You fired? - The deed is done. All alone? - I threw it away. With your fingerprints? Enough of your bullshit. Why are you ringing? - Jean can't find the key. He has floored us. Ask him what he's done. Jean, what's happened? - No, not on the stairway. Go in. I'm telling you to go in! What's with him? He's going to tell you. Jean, explain. Go on. Daniel will understand everything. It's his speciality. Tell him what you've done. He has brought down a nightwatchman. - What? What are you saying? It's not possible. - It's how it is. You weren't armed. - The nightwatchman had a weapon. I disarmed him with my cigarette lighter. And then this one, like the last of the cretins... Are you going to tell your Daniel? Jean, it isn't true? Yes, I shot him. - But why? I fired. - Explain. Overtaken by fear, he fired. Stupidly. And the guy is dead? - He fell. Just at the moment when it was all done. After this, we could have gone. The Massif Central, that's more his kind of place. You didn't mention that you still haven't emerged from under your mother's skirts. Who gave him the gun? - Me. Who had the idea? - Me, but you all agreed. On the condition that there would be no violence, no weapons. I see. Accuse me to defend your darling. I offered him a place on my boat, and now I'm paying the consequences. Philippe, if something's gone wrong, it's all our faults. Have you become deaf? We told you that he was alone, that he fired alone. Why did you do this? - Get off him! You taking his side? We must remain united whatever happens. We understand, Daniel Epstein. If the police find nothing, we can remain friends, otherwise you've thrown us all in the drink. We'll all be there. - Thanks in advance. There's nothing more to be said tonight. Bye. 2am! Don't shout. You giving the orders here? I smell alcohol. Mum, I need you. When you spend the night with your friends without thinking of me. Mum, I have no more friends. What good news! I'm going to tell you... It's me that needs to have a few words with you to remind you of the life I've accepted because of you. It's not the moment. To render our accounts? Now's exactly the moment. Jean, look at this photo. It's me with your father. Young and in love, several months after your birth. You wouldn't have survived in Indochina. I returned to France hoping that your father would remain faithful. That didn't last long. I lost him because of you. I turned down rich men because of you. I didn't give up all that to lose you at 16. Listen... Not one word! You are ungrateful. You are like your father. This evening, you're just like him. But you won't drink any more. You are not going out again. I'm locking you in. I'm going to be sick. - Wait. Show some respect to your mother. If you come back after midnight again, you'll find me in my armchair with my wrists slit. It may be in the evening papers. You? - Me. I went to your place and saw you. Yesterday evening, they stole 3M worth of stamps from me. What's that? - You tell me. What do you want to know? I was with you. A charming evening. But I am a good player. I admire the trick with the window, the trick with the telephone, the trick with Cacatoes. Perfect. I blame only the trick with the revolver. - They fired it? I said to myself that there was more than one. Let's walk a little, we need to talk. Philippe is part of this? - I was with you, I don't know. Of course. I have a message for your young gangsters. You know Philippe better than me. He has good reason to laugh in my face. Relay my proposition to them. Why me? I don't want to get involved in all this. Even if the proposition is in their interests? I've been rolled, I accept it. But I want to limit the damage. They must return the stamps for a 10th of their value. This will make some good business when I buy them. I'm asking to buy back my stamps. I offer 10%. Once again, should I... - Stop this joking. I haven't yet reported the robbery. But there is a nightwatchman with a slug in his belly. If I recount all the details of that evening, the police will find the guilty. If I keep my mouth shut, they'll find nothing, and your friends will gain 300,000F. Advise them to return my stamps. You're hesitating? I would never bring a complaint against Philippe because of his mother. There are things one doesn't do, that honour forbids. In the times we live in, sacrificing 10% to honour, it's the most that we can ask of someone. The Hindu government has offered to mediate in the Korean conflcit. Indian representatives at the UNO have contacted the belligerants and they have proposed a plan for the suspension of hostilities. The world is on the edge of the third world war. Maintain the hope that peace can be saved. And here today... Finally a victory for good sense. - For once, we agree. A war would have been the end of civilsation. I agree. - Long live the armistice. And the Americans to go home. On the condition that the other side relinquish their conquered territory. They weren't the first aggressor... The aggressor? Who started it? North Korea. - South Korea. If you don't accept the armistice... - If you refuse to evacuate Korea... You propose a bad armistice... - A bad peace... in the name of the false democracies and their false principles... We shouldn't be arguing. The news is excellent. We were arguing about a point of detail, the armistice, Liliane. You understand, Liliane? There are hopes of peace. What's up with you? Something else you have to tell me? This trust between us is a great emotion, but if you have any more confessions it'll be most annoying... At least, that's my system and it's a happy day. You know how I love Richard, and what this has led to... This I admit. When I told you that we wanted to leave here, you approved. This also I admit. But if the Hindus are successful? - We couldn't rely on them. And to be ready, we needed money. I gave you your ring. Daddy, how do you want us to go with 15,000F? It's not so much, but me with figures and practical questions... What have you done to find this money? I met a dirty old man who proposed that I come to admire his stamps. You never said! - What would you have done? We would have broken his face. Richard and the others have done that. - They have my approval. He had been doing some strange deals with his stamps. A proper government would have locked him up. That's what we wanted to do. - Bravo. You've been to his to steal these stamps? You had approved of us. Liliane, don't push me too far. And you haven't said you regret it. - Not me, but the boys. I can breathe again. What they've done is perhaps excusable, but... they will have big trouble. - Unless they have an alibi. Where are you heading? They are your students that you've been preparing for their bac. If they had spent the evening here working with you... You dare ask your father to give false testimony? You wanted to smash Montessan's face, seize his belongings. Richard did all that. I will not give false testimony. Daddy, all your life you've dreamt of changing society, struggling against the law and the police, and you would abandon your students with nothing for their defence. I beg you, in this appeal to my intelligence, you are asking me to do an insane thing. You would allow four boys of 17 to throw their lives away? Daddy, if misfortune arrives to Richard, it arrives for me too. Are you with me, or with a man who would have... Shut up. Liliane. You are horrifying me. How far would you have me go? What would you have me say? Very simply that all four were here yesterday evening. Perhaps... I might declare that they came here... for a time. Around midnight. Anyway, I'm sure that nobody will will ask you anything. Anyone can ask anything. But in return, you must promise me that you are going to calm down, and that for a long time you will have nothing to confess to me. Liliane, swear this. In all honesty, there is one more detail. More? A detail that is serious. Wait. I am sitting on my chair. I am on tenterhooks. Go on, I'm listening. There was... an accident. What accident? They... wounded a nightwatchman. Almost nothing? What's next? Who will they kill? How many will they massacre? Don't spare me. If you can trust your father with anything, take advantage of it. They haven't wounded any men. Thanks for that. I have become the accomplice to a theft, and a murder. The leader of the gang. And when the police come, I should resist them? By being an enlightened father, I'm going to end up in the court of assizes, this is where education leads us. That key under the doormat is no more. And all this, it's... it's over. As are, from today, your studies. You keep your secrets. You will tell me nothing, I won't ask. What do you want? Epstein, they're asking for you. Who wants me? You have my permission to leave the class. Inspector Mallingre of the criminal police. Are you Daniel Epstein? - It's me. Do you know Mr. Montessan? No, who is he? The day before yesterday, where were you in the evening? Like every evening, doing my homework and lessons. Before going to bed, I took my medication. And I had a bath. You are ill? My nervous system gives me insomnia. You didn't go out? Not for the last 15 days, no. Where is your car garaged? I leave it parked in front of my home. It's cheaper. Is it possible that it was taken and returned? I have the ignition key, and I haven't noticed anything. But can I ask what this is all about? The evening of the day before yesterday, between Rueil and Colombes, a milkman saw a 4CV going at full speed on the road that leads from Montessan's. I don't know this gentleman. The milkman couldn't follow the 4CV, but he did have time to write down the registration. It is yours. I don't understand it. My car hasn't a scratch. It almost crashed. If you would be so kind to come tomorrow to the PJ... [N.B. French equivalent of CID or the FBI] repeat to Commissioner Auvain what you have just told us. But I don't know anything. Then it will all be over quickly. Bureau 212 at 10am. Thank you for coming so quickly. I came as soon as I could. - Serge, I am in a panic. My poor Francoise. I am here to help you and to reassure you. Read this telegram. Will be in Paris Friday 8pm. All gone well. Kisses. I don't understand. It's good news. You find it so? If your husband is returning from Dakar, it means peace is safe. Everything is going to be sorted out. For other perhaps, but not for us. For us, it means a return to lying, of sharing. I can't carry on like this. And you? Between war which was keeping your husband down there, and peace which separates us... I prefer the peace, all the same. Serge, for a month the people of the world have believed that all was lost. I've never been so happy. In deciding to stay with you, I have made my choice definitively. I accept all the risks. Even death. Today, if you wished, I would have the courage to confront Charles, to tell him the truth. - He will take it very badly. I have foreseen the consequences. I accept them with joy, if you are in agreement. If he demands a divorce, what will become of you? An honest woman. I love you, I want to live with you. You're forgetting that you have a son. I can do no more for his happiness. But Serge, do you need me to be happy? He needs you, Francoise. My fortunes are nothing like those of Boussard. It doesn't matter if we are together. Serge, all the years I have left to live, I am ready to risk them on a word of yours. Tell me that you want me to give it all up for you. Francoise... don't commit this folly. Can I ask you just one question? At your age, are you ready to start your life again? Francoise, understand me... my fortune is my freedom. Even if you were ten years younger, I would not marry you. You are the ideal mistress, because you are someone else's wife. You find me odious? I am honest. We can't have any more children, Francoise. If you want to be unfaithful, I would forgive it. But no scandal. No row with Boussard, who is a friend. Don't cry, Francoise, don't cry. These events have shaken us, but all that has been worked out. Before he left, were we so unhappy? Francoise, listen to me. Come on, Francoise. I've called your place three times. I was at the criminal police to report the theft of my stamps. I've seen Liliane and my friends. We're not going to play the wise guys anymore. We ask your forgiveness. We will return your stamps. We want to do something for the nightwatchman. I pay tribute to your good sentiments. Unhappily, he has died. It's not possible. Early this afternoon. This business has become very serious. A nightwatchman is almost a policeman. It's the court of assizes, Philippe. With a tough jury, twenty years with hard labour. And perhaps... Perhaps? The theft of my stamps fades into the background. You will return them, or the police will return them. The police won't discover anything. Let's hope so. They have already identified a car, a 4CV belonging to a certain Daniel Epstein. You know him? He's a comrade. I beg you, help us, save us. How? My business dealings aren't always irreproachable, but I organise myself so that there's no blood spilt. And your corpse, I leave him to you. I don't know what to do. I don't know this Daniel Epstein, but it all depends on him. They will interrogate him relentlessly. The last war didn't teach us much, but the police learnt a few things. Their technique was perfected. And when they concentrate on an individual... Don't drink like that, Philippe. If he keeps quiet, you can return the stamps and I'll say nothing. What more do you want me to do for you and your parents? Your friend needs to remain silent. He must hold out against their most pressing invitations. If not... Mummy, I need you. Mr. Philippe, it's Mr. Richard asking for you. I'm coming. Hold on, please. Hello, is that you? I'm at the skating-rink. I must see at once, with Jean. Find him and bring him here. No, I can't go anywhere else. I don't have a dime. People... The nightwatchman... I know. I'm coming. With Jean, if I can find him. PEACE IS SAVED. Detente in Korea, negotiations before an armistice. [Side-story] Tragic hold-up in Garches. Can I offer you something? With your money. For a moment, I had lost my bearings... With this, I'm back on track. Whisky. - A quart of Vittel. Whisky and a quart of Vittel. You've seen Montessan? - Yes To get his stamps back, he'll say nothing, providing Daniel is silent. Have you seen Daniel? No, he said we should be cautious. - That's being a good friend. You remember the oath? When one's called Epstein, Daniel Epstein... When leaving the school, what did he say to you? "Trust me", and he shook my hand. Another one of those who won't kiss you because he's going to denounce you to the cops behind closed doors. He won't talk. He'll talk. Treachery is in his blood. So? So we must do something. What? It doesn't matter what, but something. Let's go. - Not me. You have most to lose. Maybe, but I'm not coming. Anyway, we couldn't get in. You have the key. Not that. It's your fault. Give us the key. Most to lose, you understand? Give us the key... or I'll telephone your mother and tell her everything. Don't do that, I'm begging you. Garcon, a token for the telephone. Right away. You've made your choice? So hand over the key and you can stay here. Go see Liliane. Tell her to wait for us. We'll go out through the toilets. The gentlemen have left? - For the toilets... they'll be back. Dear madame, I understand nothing of your concerns. But I give you my word that Jean is not at mine. I don't believe you. I trusted in you, and I was wrong. Jean has become distant because of you. I don't deserve this when I received you in my house. It's because you never had a mother that you are dangerous. My instinct... If you knew the sacrifices that I have made for Jean, you'd understand better. There's nothing a mother wants more than her son's happiness, that I am not ready to do. When I have to choose between my happiness and my son's I don't hesitate... You want the telephone? - No, I'm looking for two girls. I must use the phone. - They're a blonde and a brunette. I'm sorry. If we saw you more often, I'd cut you in on the chase. I see that the sacrifices are always on the same side... Who's there? I'm in my bath. Who's come in? But Jean's heart... Is that you, Jeannot? It's not Jeannot. It's us. How did you get in? Through the keyhole. Why are you here? There could be detectives watching the house. We hadn't thought of that... - You don't think of anything. Leave it, we need to talk. Have you been drinking? And where's Jean? At the end of the line to tell you to close your latch. Why are you here? You know that the nightwatchman is dead? I'm ashamed to say, but if he's died, this might be better for us. You realise what it may cost? - He won't identify anyone. He won't talk. Agreed that he won't, but there remain others who might. You mean me? When I am the only one keeping a cool head? You haven't stopped making mistakes, first by provoking the murder, then panicking like madmen. You never told about the incident with the milkman. That farce has your signature all over it. You don't understand that it's your good fortune that their trail has led to me. Providing you keep your mouth shut. Show some intelligence. All right, Daniel Epstein. Your logic is impeccable. What have you told them? - Have you gone crazy? Not yet, but how much will it take before you start talking? Let me talk to him. - Don't move. Let me get out of the water. - You're used to it. The Gestapo taught you. You're mad! - Sit. What have you told them? - I was at home. We want to know where to find the car. Out front. - You have it ready for what? Nothing. - For your chums? For your friends? I'm here all alone. - Who are these friends? I have many. - The ones you see every day. You don't remember? Here, this helps the memory. Their names? Stop or I'll scream. Scream, nobody will care. You could do it from hours. Your friends had gone to Montessan? I was on my own. - Where was Arnaud that evening? I don't know. And Dutoit and Boussard and Liliane? - Where are they? This will give you time to think. Before, it was engaged. Now, the line is free, but there's no answer. Why would they go to his? - I don't know. And I gave them the key. Always you. With the revolver, with the key, it's the same thing. You shouldn't have. It's that, I shouldn't have, but I was trying to save Daniel. Liliane, what can I do? For Daniel? I'm thinking of Richard. Gentlemen, we are about to close. Please, don't ask. I shouldn't have given you the key. What have you done? - I don't know. It was Philippe. And me... It was all of us. In his bath, he indicated "no" with his head. And then suddenly, he wasn't moving anymore. And the worst thing was.. It was that he never would have talked. He died without saying a word. Ladies and gentlemen, sorry but we're closing. It totals 3,420. There is the service as well. There, take it. - Thank you. And good night to you all. Richard, in the last hour, you don't know the ideas that have been churning in my head, the most idiotic, the most frightful. For you, how to save you. Richard, they'll never believe that he died... that he died all alone. He seemed to be sleeping. We have suffered everything, everything... Just the day before your convocation. But they are not so naive. They'll continue searching. So? So imagine that they found the stamps at his place and the revolver. It would be him that stole, him that fired. It would be a suicide. And that would be the end of it. But how would he have committed suicide? You coming? What's all this? The doctor is there. Let the doctor do his job. Jean has taken poison. Jean? Why? I'll explain to you later. Is it serious? - Not now. If you had allowed him to slide a glance, none of this would have happened. I don't understand it. Jean had no secrets from me. My little boy! - He's not so little. Oh God, save him! Please. Who are you? - Is Jean Arnaud here? He has poisoned himself because of the anguish of love. It is not the moment. It is just the right moment. Don't fight it, empty yourself. In good time. I beg you... Criminal police. We want to talk to him. Let him breathe. This won't take long. If you would kindly leave him to us. It's your responsibility. Don't worry about us, carry on vomiting. But your friend Epstein was not a suicide. The gas was just for show. They killed him before. Who? The concierge saw you there every day. You must know them. Don't pretend to vomit. Who killed your buddy? It wasn't me. - Then who? We'll leave you alone when you tell us who. Otherwise, we will carry on like this for some time. Who killed your friend? Richard Dutoit. There. You are sensible. Another little bit of goodwill and this will all be over. Dutoit acted alone? With Philippe Boussard. - Perfect. And the business with the stamps is also them? Yes. - The girl who was at Montessan's? Liliane Noblet. Who killed the nightwatchman? Me. The drama is played out. What is your part in the responsibility, the culpability? In what part were you victims of the climate of panic, which we can hardly believe now that the danger is so distant? To these questions, it is up to you to answer, because justice is not accusing you of anything. She is not accusing your children. However, if the jury knew all the details of your private life, heard all your most intimate secrets, would your verdict perhaps be different? Too late, the jury has decided. The court. The hearing is reconvened. Guard, bring in the defendants. To the questions brought, the court and the jury have responded thus... Nine questions concerning Richard Dutoit, charged with breaking and enterring, of complicity in the manslaughter of a nightwatchman, of the murder of Daniel Epstein. He is 17 years old. The court and the jury sentence Richard Dutoit to 10 years of hard labour. Nine questions concerning Philippe Boussard, They are the same. He is 17 years old. The court and the jury sentence Philippe Boussard to 10 years' hard labour. Seven questions concerning Jean Arnaud: is he guilty of the murder of the nightwatchman? Is he an accomplice to the murder of Daniel Epstein? He has just turned 17 years old. The court and the jury sentence Jean Arnaud to 5 years' hard labour. Eight questions concerning Liliane Noblet: is she an accomplice to the theft, the manslaughter, the murder? She is not yet 17 years old. The court and the jury announce her acquittal. Guards, remove the defendants. The trial is over. Not this way, please. - My daughter has been acquitted. She will be freed tomorrow. The law has declared... - The law is not the rules. Just one more night. It'll pass quickly. If it was up to me... - Don't say anything silly. Hurry up with your farewells. The gentlemen's bus is out back. There's one small thing I've never said, Liliane. Now, I want to, most of all in front of Richard. You pleased me most strongly. I liked you very much, too. Give me your hand. Liliane, I should never have given them the key. I ask your forgiveness. But Jean, I am free. So much the better, but I should never have. It's difficult to say farewell. Say goodbye to me. Goodbye, Liliane. No, don't cry. It must be come to terms with. We must repeat all the time: "we never stole". I accept it. But the hardest thing is you. Will you write to me? I'll write to you. - It's all that I ask of you. I know very well what you're thinking of. What you don't dare say. But I will try, Richard, I will try to wait for you. Then we will both try. You to wait for me... and I to... to accept it. Goodbye, Liliane. Goodbye, dear. It was pre-determined. The 5th juror was called David. The English chased out of Teheran. War over oil. Oil threatens peace. War over oil. Your friends the English... - Please, not tonight.
