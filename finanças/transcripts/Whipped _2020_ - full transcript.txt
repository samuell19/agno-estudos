ANDOVI DA LOPEZ, 25 YEARS OLD ACTOR, DATING BUT NOT WHIPPED TOMMY LIMMM, 24 YEARS OLD, ACTOR, ENGAGED CHANDRA LIOW, 26 YEARS OLD DIRECTOR, SINGLE JOVIAL DA LOPEZ, 29 YEARS OLD, SCRIPTWRITER, DATING FOR FOUR YEARS Welcome to the anti-whipped class. This class will help you set yourself free from being a slave of love. For our first meeting, we will learn about patience. Patience is the key to a healthy relationship. What is going on? Why are we tied up? My head is spinning. Did they drug us? I think so. "What are you doing?" Kirana, 20 minutes ago. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Where's my phone? No bulge in your pants. Why would you look for a bulge in my pants? For your phone. The first rule of an escape room: no phones inside the escape room. No phones? "Why aren't you answering?" Kirana. Tommy, your fiancée is also looking for you. What should I say? That's my fiancée! Why are you the one replying? What is going on? Can I reply to my girlfriend? Can you let us go? Sure. As soon as you escape from this room. And my name is Vania. It's time to learn. Guys! This is too easy. This is an escape room. I'm a master of escape rooms. We have to escape from this room. Thank you, Chandra. We know the concept of an escape room. Look at the words. "Patience is key." Over there is a door. -It opens with… -A key. -And the key is… -Patience. So we need to find… -The key. It's the key. -Patience. It's patience. -It's patience! -It's the key. The key is patience. -Hey, Jo! -Shit, guys. Violence is not the key. Jo, patience is the key. Maybe the key is under the chair! Chan, no. Patience is the key! Tommy! Can you stop saying that? It's like you're doing a retake. I'm a director. There's nothing under my chair. Did you guys check your pockets? There's something in mine. -Nothing in mine. -Nothing. I don't have pockets. That means the key is in your pocket, Tom. Which pocket, Tom? The left one. But how do we get it? With a mouth. But whose mouth? -Yours, Jo! -Chandra! -No, you do it! -Andovi! Fine! I'll do it. For Kirana. Okay. Dov! Dov! It tickles! Dov! -Is this the key? -Those are my balls! Move it to the right, okay? Dov, how do I move my balls from left to right? -Just try! -Tom! I'll help you get it out. -What? -The key. Right. HELLO? I'll hold his pants in place. One, two, three! Kirana just texted. She doesn't seem happy. -Tom, do you have a hard-on? -Yeah. Wait. No! Are you crazy? What's this hard thing? -The key. -Keys don’t come in this size! -Why is it so small? -It's above average. If someone was rubbing your balls, wouldn't you get a hard-on? -I'm a guy, Tom! -I can only see hair from up here! You're giving a head to text your girlfriend back. -You're whipped. -Shut up! I'm doing this for us. Chan, it's almost out. Tom, be ready. One, two, three! -Yes! -Get it out. Come on! Get it out, Tommy! Tom, those aren't door keys. They are your car keys! Relax. If I don't text Kirana back, she'll think I'm up to something weird. Dov, Dov, Dov. Look at what you just did. You're obviously up to something weird. I'm doing this so we can get out! Guys! I'm a master of escape rooms. Chan, shut up. Listen to me. Just calm down. -I can't. -Everyone be quiet! Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Just for one minute! Trust me. Congratulations. You've passed the first test. Where's my phone? I need to reply to Kirana. I have to reply to Julia! You'll have it in a moment. What's wrapped around your bodies is a-- Heart rate monitor. No, it's a heart rate monitor. Master of escape rooms. That's right, Jo. If you are patient, your body will relax, and your heart rate will slow down. -And the door-- -Will open. The key is to just be patient. That can be challenging, but the results will always be rewarding. That's enough for today. See you in the next class. -Indra. -Yes, Ma'am? My phone! My phone! Guys, I actually already knew that it was a heart rate monitor. What is this class? I want to quit. Excuse me. Remember the agreement. There is a clause regarding termination of contract. There is a fine. That's right. Dov, let's just continue, okay? Believe me, you need this class. Andovi, you're whipped! Jo. I'm not whipped. Hello, my baby! -Hello. -Hello. Could you move your car? I'm waiting for my girlfriend. She's coming out. I see. All right. Excuse me, Sir. Can you go around first? I won't be long, really. Hey, jackass! Move! Sir, I'm really sorry. You said it wouldn't take long, but where is she? -Are you saying my girlfriend's a liar? -I didn't say that. Don't be selfish. The cars behind you are honking. Hurry up! I need to use the bathroom. Why are you honking? You care so much about honking. Now I'm honking too. This guy is nuts. The people behind are honking because you're not moving. -What are you honking for? -Mind your own business! This is my business! I've been patient with you. I asked you to move, but you refused. Are you uneducated? Go to school! Educate yourself! What's going on? Are they shooting La La Land? Kiki! Baby. Finally, she's here. Baby. Why were there only two missed calls? -I'm sorry I'm late. -It's okay, Kiki. I will die everyday Waiting for you. Baby? Baby! Baby! Baby, hey! Because I will die everyday waiting for you. Die! Baby! Whipped! I'm late! Sorry I'm late! That's okay. We were looking at these. Aren't they cute? Wait a minute. What's the difference between these two reds? This is oxblood red. This is crimson red. What? What about just red? Oxblood red and crimson red are quite similar. There's not much difference. But crimson red is slightly lighter. As for the one you call "just red", well, that's another color entirely. Why would you ask that, Commy? That's common sense. I'm sorry, I didn't know it was common sense. So which one would you choose, Commy? If you don't choose now, I won't eat. And I'm very hungry. All right. Actually, I already know which one I want. But I just want to make sure your choice is the same as mine. Are we made for each other? This question is a trap. What should I do? Julia! Why don't we just eat some food first? Commy. I mean, Tommy, let's just decide now. To help ease things up. I've got an idea. Let's close our eyes and point to a color. I will count to three. We close our eyes and point, and then we look? -Yes! -Okay! One, two, three! We're soulmates! -Which one is cheaper? -I'll text you later. This smile shows falling in love, and this one happiness. Which one? -Whatever. They're the same. -Come on. Which one should I upload? The one you like best. I'll pick the loved-up one, since it's our anniversary. -What did you do today? -The usual. Brainstorming. Are you writing a new story? Yeah. A love story. Why didn't you tell me? Because I'm still not sure… how it will end. Can I help? No, I'll be fine. All right. I'm here if you need me. Thanks, babe. What are you up to? I'm reading the WhatsApp group. We're talking about Tommy's wedding. What about our wedding? I've told you before. I will only get married once I have a house. All right, babe. I was just joking. Don't get upset. -What are they discussing? -The color of the flowers. Can I see? Wait. I'm telling you, they were the same color. Tommy, relax. At our base camp, my place, there is always a solution. Chan, have you ever attended a wedding and realized that the flowers displayed were oxblood red? Tom, that's the best type of red. What? Just a second, bro. Andovi Da Lo… Huh? Kirana! Hi, Chan. -What brings you here? -Well, Andovi said he had some work. I came to keep him company. Do not come in! Mom? Do not come in! Mint? Do not come in! Come in! Come in! Come in, Kirana! Thank you. I said, "Don't invite her in!" -Hey, Kir! -Hi, Tom! Thank you, Baby. Where's Julia? She's mentally exhausted from choosing the flowers. -All day? -Oh, no. From, like, 3 p.m. Because the four of us were-- Cut! Cut! Cut! I'm a director. I have to practice yelling "Cut"! -Right. -The four of you… were… ONE WEEK AGO Guys. So we're in agreement? We're taking this class -so we're not whipped. -I'm not. Bullshit. You're texting Kirana. Anti-whipped class, huh? I have to pay for the wedding venue. Tommy. Who am I? Chandra? Tom. I'm your best friend! I'll pay for your class. Thank you, Chan! But wait. Why are you taking part? You're single. I'm in on two conditions. First, please don't let this class ruin our paintball schedule. Second, I'm in if Jo is in. All right, settled! -Andovi, you in? -No. What? "I'm on my way"? You're leaving? But we're still talking, Andovi! Guys, listen. "I'll bring the vegan pizza to Bekasi, Kiki." We're in Serpong! It's so far! Vi, you're whipped! Guys, he even used lyrics. Kiki, do you love me, are you riding Enough! Andovi! You are whipped! You have to take the class. Fine. I will. Jo, how did you find out about this class? This person messaged me on Instagram. She often leaves comments on our posts. Chan, check the website. The website says they use extreme methods. -Does that mean it's dangerous? -It's just marketing. But guys, please. Kirana can't know about this. Andovi, you just need to make up an excuse. For example, "I want to spend more time with my parents." Exactly. Or, "I want to be healthier, so I'm taking yoga classes." I will never take yoga classes. The point is to come up with an excuse that our girlfriends will believe. The four of you were… -Spending time with our parents. -Doing yoga. Forget it, babe. It's not important what we did. What's important is… Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding? Say you never ever leave from beside me 'Cause I want ya -Your turn. -Okay. Come on, Tom. Babe, what did you do today? I was looking for a present for your birthday. -Wait. When is her birthday? -Eight months from now. Who looks for a present that long ahead? It's dedication. We have to change our answers. We can't keep on saying, "I was looking for your birthday present." It's dedication! -He keeps on forgetting. -Typical. Good morning. Ready for today's class? -Please don't drug us again. -There is none of that today. -Indra? -Yes, Ma'am. Please leave your belongings here. Don't forget the first rule of escape room.: no phones inside the escape room. What's wrong Tom? Please, nothing too extreme. Sometimes we need to experience something extreme to be able to change. Why, thank you, Oprah. "Honesty is key." Guys! We're in an escape room again. No. We're in a restaurant. -What could it be this time? -Relax. Be patient. We'll find out. It's not patience. Honesty is key. Okay, Tommy! Stop saying that! It's like… a retake. I'm a director. If you don't escape from this room in 15 minutes, I will let your girlfriends know that you are taking part in this anti-whipped class. Guys, if Julia finds out I'm not working on the wedding decorations, I'm dead! Kirana thinks I'm at a shoot! I get it! If we're honest, the door will open. That's it. Vania! I need to be honest. When I put my head on Tommy's dick, that wasn't the first time that my head was on a man's dick. -It was not the first time! -When? When I went to Thailand, I visited Soi Cowboy. There were a lot of options there. One of them was-- My turn to confess! When Andovi put his head on my balls, I liked it! -What? -Sorry! What I mean is, -I… -That's enough, Tom! While Andovi and Tommy were being weird… I was disgusted! But I didn't want them to stop. What? You like watching two guys getting it on? I don't like it, okay? But I don't have a problem with it. Open-minded, bro. Stop. The door is still locked. It's not working. It's because you haven't said anything! Right. We've all been honest except you. About what? I wasn't involved. -What about that time at Holywings? -Which one? See? You don't even remember it. All right. Okay. Vania. Last week, Chandra and I went to Holywings. And I paid for the food using Chandra's credit card. -Jovial Da Lopez! -Sorry, I didn't have cash! Guys, stop! The door's still locked. I didn't hear anything. What do we do? Should I go again? When I went to Thailand, I had choices. -The first choice I said-- -Dov! Dov, I have my other phone with me. -It's in my shoe, because Julia-- -Tommy. What the heck! -I let you bring your phone in. -You brought your phone? It is the most important clue in this escape room. You have five minutes left. -Five minutes! -Five minutes left! Guys! I'm a master of escape rooms. Let me do some deduction of escape rooms. Mobile phone. Bape. Hypebeast, how much is your outfit? -Expensive? Royal? Robbery. -How did you go from royal to robbery? You suck at this game. Okay. The phone is the biggest clue. The biggest clue. I know. We have to call our girlfriends. It's not about being honest with each other, but with our girlfriends. Who wants to go first? Come on. Who's first? -It's a democracy. Let's decide together. -Come on. -Andovi! -Come on! Come here. -What is with you? -We only have five minutes. Eenie, meenie, miney, mo! -Be serious. -Do it again! Eenie, meenie, miney, mo! Andovi, stop fooling around. Eenie, meenie, miney, mo! Dov, you go first! Here. Make the call! Hi, Kiki! -Andovi? -Yes, Baby. This is me. -Whose number is it? -Hurry! -It's Tommy's. -Tommy has two phones? -Yes. -You only have one, don't you? Yes, only one. He's so whipped! Did you just shush me? No, Baby. I wasn't shushing you! -Okay. So, what is it? -Right. So I called you to let you know that I can't pick you up-- -What happened? -What is it? What's wrong? You didn't charge your phone. -There was a blackout for 31 hours! I can't count on them. I am the master of escape rooms. I have to get us out. I'm the best here. I am Chandra Liow. I have to get them out. But how? Chan. We passed? Congratulations. You passed the second test. If you have lied, you should be truthful. If she finds out that you lied, she will be disappointed. And that will only make you more whipped. That's enough for today. See you in the next class. -Indra. -Yes, Ma'am? -Return their belongings. -Yes. It really was bad. With that 31-hour blackout, I couldn't even go to the mall. Yeah. It sounds awful. Van. I understand what you're doing. I really do. But can't you just teach us using normal methods? Would you listen to me if I did? Some of you are so high on the whipped scale… that I have to use out-of-ordinary methods. Guys, paintball? -I have basketball. -Dinner. Canceled again? Wait! Indra? You can leave us. Yes, Ma'am. Nice book. You've read this? Right, you're a love expert. I was wondering. -Do love experts have a boyfriend? -Why do you ask? Are you interested? Why did you create this class? I study psychology. My dissertation is about the effects of love on mental health. I want to help people so that they won't be whipped. I joined this class just to accompany my brother. Are you sure? Too easy! Time out! Time out! Come on! Come on! Come on! Guys. Where's Andovi? Please be patient, Kiki. How much longer? You said you'll be done by 8 p.m. I didn't know we'd go into overtime. You promised you'd take me shopping after the game. It will only be ten more minutes. You said the same thing ten minutes ago. I can't predict the score. You can't keep a promise either. Kiki, my baby. Can't you just get the bag tomorrow? What if it's sold out? Am I supposed to buy a fake? Ew! Could you go and I meet you there? I need to finish this game. Guys, we can still make it! Andovi, focus. Focus, okay? Let's go. One, two, th… -What's wrong? -I have a stomachache. You're such a bad actor. Look at you! You want to leave with your girlfriend. I really am sick. Who's going to replace you? Abi! Dov, he's injured. Pain is all in the mind. If you believe you're not injured, then you're not injured! You got this, Abi! How cute! It's a limited edition, Baby! Oh, my God! What's that? A purse for cats? It's tiny. Where do I pay? Hi Uncle, Auntie, Julia's family. How are you all? Tommy! Hi Julia! I'm saying hi to your family. It's my first time meeting them. What's your name? Tommy, my family is over here! Well then… Dad. Tom, finally! -Have a seat. -Okay. You made it, finally. Good evening. Why are you late? My car broke down. I see. Have you had dinner? -Ouch. -Eat up! -Thanks. -Help yourself. William, how are you? Granny, this is Tommy. -Not William? -No. William has a very high-paying job. Excuse me. Would like to order anything else? Tommy, do you want something? There's plenty of food left. I don't wanna waste any. Right. I'll have the check, please. Coming right up. Pay for it. What? But I didn't order anything. Commy, these are your future in-laws. I'll take care of the bill this time. Tommy, you're a good boy. -Eat up! -Thanks. Here's the check. Right. Are you sure this is not a WiFi password? Why is it so long? The WiFi password is: liu de hua cap it cap ji be ancua. Look at how long it is! Haven't you being saying you'd get a new car for the past year? I have. But we're getting married. So I've been saving money… and here we are. VAN, THANK YOU FOR TODAY'S CLASS. Jo. You're always on your phone lately. Can you put it down? -I need to talk to you. -So do I. You seem more distant from me these days. Cill. Actually, I… VANIA YOU'RE WELCOME, JO. Who is Vania? A friend. -What were you going to say? -Never mind. I better get going. Chan. Where are you? Someone named Jovial Da Lopez wants to sing with us. Where is he? Jo! Go on stage! It's me! There he is. Give it up for Jovial Da Lopez! -What song? -"Sepatu", by Tulus. -That's my friend! -Sorry for changing the mood. We are a pair of shoes We're always together but never one It's like we are soulless We move because of humans I'm the right shoe And you're the left shoe I love it if they take us running Damn, Jovial is not bad! I like it when we get caught in the rain But I'm scared you might catch a cold We always want to be together But we can't do anything about it Keep singing! Jo needs another drink. It's so cute! Look at it! Baby. Did you come to the store with me because you felt guilty? Kiki, what did I do? You called earlier. What did you want to say? Kiki, my baby. I always make time for you. But I feel like… I feel like… Andovi. Speak properly. I feel like you don't appreciate me. Why would you say that? You called me using Tommy's phone. You're mumbling. I didn't know where you were. -What's going on? -Fine. -You want me to be honest? -Yes. I can't pick you up anymore. -Andovi. -Because… I have class. What class? -Yoga. -Why didn't you tell me? Surprise! Surprise! -You're doing it alone? -No. With Tommy, Chandra, and Jo. The usual. -Can I come? -What? I'm free tomorrow. Say what? -What time is it? -At 10 a.m. Perfect. I mean… -2 p.m. -My meeting ends at 1 p.m. I'll meet you there. No need to pick me up. Good night, Baby. Tom. Emergency. Jo! No need to think about anything tonight. -A chillax night! -Chillight! Vania! Why are you here? You look different! Think I wear a suit everywhere? Don't tell me we're now in an escape room? Chan, you're drunk! I am the master of escape rooms. Holywings is key… which means the key is… I'm so sleepy. The band playing was my friend's. When I arrived, you were singing. Jovial Da Lopez. Scriptwriter, vocalist. Hey, wake up! Andovi texted me. What's this? -Chan, I can't read! -"Yoga tomorrow at 2 p.m."? So paintball is canceled again? -Shit. -Crazy! I don't want to. You're crazy! No, you're crazy! No! You're crazy! You're weak. Here. -Let's go. -I'll walk him outside. Fantastic. We always want to… I forgot the lyrics! Feels good to have a shoulder. Before today… I already knew you were in a rocky relationship. Of course. Psychology student. How long have you been dating? Three… four years? Four years. Are you bored? Or just not ready for marriage? Who doesn't get bored? Actually… I don't have feelings anymore. And moreover… Can you believe that… during our 4th anniversary, she asked to post a selfie, and I was on my phone installing a dating app? That's a dick move. My heart tells me… to break up. But my brain here… right here… doesn't want to break up. Remember the song I sang? We're a pair of shoes, look at my shoes. Always together But never one. Thank you, Holywings. Thank you! Jo. You have two choices. Give it up… or fight for it. Easier said than done. Those are two difficult choices. Give up? That's hard. Fight for it? That's hard too. Isn't there another choice? No. You're whipped, Jo. No. You've got the wrong guy. Andovi is, not me. You are whipped. You're scared of letting go of love. Jo. You're an adult. If it no longer works… just… -let-- -let her go. Your ride is here. I better go. Jo? See you in the next class. Thank you, Van. Excuse me. Sorry. Are you… Dovial Da Lopez? Hop on. Dovi. Eyes! My eyes are moving as they should! Silence, please. And now, the triangle pose. Eyes! All right. Good. Very good. Let me help you. Good. Very good. Eyes! Next! Upward-facing dog. One, two, three! Nice. Very nice. Very nice. Let's take a selfie. -Tag yourselves on Instagram. -Sure, let me. Kiki. Let's go. Don't "Kiki" me. Kiki. What's wrong, Baby? Out of all the sports in the world, you chose yoga. Are you working out or checking girls out? Ew! Baby, I can't control what other people wear. I know you can't. But you can control yourself. I want you to pick a sport that will make me calm. But isn't yoga supposed to make you calm? But I'm not calm! Anyway, you're wrong. Guys. I'm sorry. Dov, help me. I'm supposed to be at a suit-fitting now. Julia's upset. I need to go there immediately. -Is the designer still there, Tom? -I don't know. Okay, then. -Go drop Tom at Julia's. -But what about you? I'll manage. Baby. So annoying. Kiki! Baby. -I can drop you off first. -No. -Baby, just get in the car. -No. Let's ride with Andovi! Vroom, vroom! Where do you want to go? To LV… Or Gucci? Aw, Baby. Okay. Hey, asshole! Move! Hi, Julia! According to Waze, you should've been here 20 minutes ago. It's been an hour. The designer has left. I'm sorry. I had to go with Andovi, and he had to drop off Kirana first. Where is your car? Is it still broken? You know that it's broken and can't be repaired. I need a new car. How are you going to buy a new car? We're getting married! Julia, listen to me. If we calculate our budget again, we can actually afford to get a new car and get married. So, just because you're too lazy to fix your car, we're reevaluating the budget we've had for the past six months? Hey. I'm not lazy. I went to the shop today. You went to the shop? -Yes. -You did? -I did. -Are you sure? -Yes. -Did you go to the shop, or did you hang out with naked women? -Baby, it's not what you think. -Then what is this? -It's not what you think! -Explain this! -It's not like that. -Look! All their tits are out! Here, this is naked! This is naked! This is naked! Those girls aren't! They're wearing gym clothes. This is naked! What the f… You have to understand. This is naked. That is not! Hi, Granny! Jul… I told you William is much better! Put on your clothes! I was with Andovi. Andovi and Kirana are fighting. It's a mess. So their relationship is more important than our wedding? You need to fix your car. I don't want this to happen again. Jovial? Vania. I came here early -because I need to talk to you. -What is it? I want to apologize for what happened last night. What happened last night? You know. Sometimes… when you're drunk… you say the truth about what's in your heart. We are a pair of shoes Always together… -There you are. -But never one -Did you get back safely? -Yeah. Did you do yoga with Andovi and Tommy this morning? No, and damn I regret it! -Why? -Look at this photo. I should have been there. We'll start the class once everyone is here, okay? Okay. So far, you've done your tests as a group. Today, you will be tested individually… because the decisions you make on your own are the hardest ones to make. Wait. We're doing it alone? Guys, I'm the master of escape rooms. Who is going to help you all? Honestly, you haven't been helping much so far. And don't forget the first rule of the escape room… No phones in the escape room. Andovi? You go first. COURAGE IS KEY Isn't that Kirana's bag? This looks familiar. Welcome to Who Wants to be a Millionaire! Oh, wow. Wait a second. Aren't you… You must think I look like the other host. But I'm much cooler. I have more hair. True. It's just you and me here. What are you gonna do? Okay. Okay. Okay, Vania! Okay, Vania! You want to see how brave I am, huh? For Kirana! For Kirana. For Kirana. Let's get that bag. For Kirana. Shit, the fire is real. The fire is so real. Yes! Not bad, Tommy. I still don't get it. How is this related to courage? -Patience, Tommy. -So is the key patience or courage? The next question is, what is the key to a healthy relationship? A. Loving yourself. B. Fulfilling her needs. C. Loving her. D. Making her happy. Aren't they all correct? Remember the questions here are designed for you. -We still have the 50/50 option, right? -Yes. -And phoning a friend? -No phones in the escape room. Right. All right then, 50/50. Okay, 50/50. A. LOVING YOURSELF C. LOVING HER I knew it would be between these two. From the side. From the side. Shit! Okay. Fire. Blow it. I can blow it. That didn't do anything! Kung fu boy. Kung fu boy. Enough! Enough! I'm not gonna hurt myself for a tiny bag! I'm done. So what's your answer? Five… Four… Three… Two… One. That's the end of the test. You didn't make it to the next question. -Want to know the answer? -Sure. What? -They're all green? -You just need to be brave Tommy. Whatever your choice is, if you have courage, there will be a way. I have to be brave? Courage comes in different forms. Yeah, but there's only a man and a woman, alone in an empty room… Have you made a decision? Everyone has the right to live their own lives. Don't make their life worse just because you can't choose. Okay. I'll decide now. I'm breaking up. And do you think that's enough to show courage? I like you. Time's up! Chandra? You can come out now. I swear… I wasn't crying. It's getting weirder. In our first class, she drugged us, and she tracked our heart rate. In the second class, she made us tell the truth. -Today, she almost killed me. -She's not going to kill you. Is this what "love kills" means? Thank you, Tommy the poet. My point is, Vania is crazy. We're being taught about "love" by a psychopath! -Maybe she has a vendetta against men. -She's not crazy. She's not crazy? Tom, what did she do to you? I played Who Wants to be a Millionaire, but there was no prize. Chan, what did she… -Why are you crying? -There was no clue in my escape room. And when time was up, she left me all… alone. Look at those two. You still think Vania isn't crazy? -She almost burned me. -Are you serious? Okay. Let's say Vania is crazy. But then, so is Kirana. She knows her boyfriend is busy, yet she wants him to answer her calls. She's not normal. -Guys, do you agree? -Jo. That's your opinion. Don't drag us into it. You think your relationship with Cilla is normal? -What do you know about relationships? -Chandra helps me a lot. But I agree about Kirana. Andovi, you're totally whipped. I'm whipped? You're whipped! You're being controlled by Julia. A marriage is a union of two people, Tom. You're saying yes to everything Julia wants. And you have completely forgotten your own needs. You're whipped! Oh, really, Dov? Bring it on, Tom! -Enough! -What now? Look at us, Jo! This anti-whipped class is destroying our friendship! No, Andovi. Being whipped is destroying us. Tom, are you sure? A hundred percent. Think it through. I want this one. It's expensive! What about the wedding? Are you Chandra or Julia? If I wanted to hear Julia's opinion, I wouldn't come here. You don't need a new car. Second-hand ones are cheaper. Chan, what if the car breaks down again? Will you fix it? -Tom. -Chandra. I'm about to become head of the family. I have to be able to make decisions. And this… is my decision. Okay. But, Tom. Your breath stinks, damn it. Move back. Back up. -Now, try speaking. -Chan. Further. Cill. I like someone else. -What? -I'm just letting you know. Wait. Who is it? From yesterday. How could you, Jo? I'm sorry. Four years. We've been dating for four years! And now you like someone else? It's not easy. I've tried every day to find a reason to like you again. Everyday, Cill! What did I do wrong, Jo? I'm always there for you everyday. Enough! Enough what? -I want to break up. -No. I don't want to break up. It's not about what you want. Well, I don't want us to break up. I don't need your permission. Jo, please don't do this. Please. Jo, I love you. I love you so much. There must be a way for us to still be together. Listen. Let's just take a break. Please. Please, Jo? Just a break. Please. Please. Okay. Okay. Guys, thank you for being here. I know we're all kind of… But finally, paintball! Paintball! Paintball. What's up with the guys? -Tommy has been acting different lately. -Really? Andovi too. What about Jo? -Teams are set? -Not yet. Let's just choose randomly. That won't be effective. Can't put the weak ones together. Here's a method that has proven to be effective for thousands of years. Chinese zodiac. I've read your personal information. Andovi, you're a dog. Tommy, you're a pig. Dogs, pigs and monkeys work well in a team. Dragons and chickens shouldn't team up. I'm a dragon, and my ex-wife is a chicken. That's why we're separated. -Excuse me. -My ex-in laws were both… -Sir. -…monkeys! -That's enough. -Fire monkeys! -Always angry! -Enough! I'm a dragon. Let's just do it randomly. Eenie, meenie, miney, mo! Good. It matches your Chinese zodiac. My daughter's zodiac is a goat. Goats go with dragons and chickens. Hey. Who should my daughter go with? This is my first time. Does it hurt when you're shot? It hurts, but not as bad as being betrayed. And does that hurt more than being badmouthed by your friend? What's our strategy? Have you watched Avengers: Endgame? Avengers: Endgame? I haven't. What? You've never watched it with Jo? Are you a DC fan? So what's our strategy? Easy. Chandra will sacrifice himself for the others. Because he thinks he's Captain America. I'm Captain America. I'm Iron Man. Civil War. What? Captain Iron? I don’t get it. Are you a DC fan? To be honest, I'm actually scared of this. I have a question. Can we reload this? No. But bullets can be donated between players. -Tommy, go! -Let's go! -Dov, I'm in position! -Cilla, go! Okay! It's muddy! -Kirana, take cover. -All right. -Where should I go? -Julia! Everyone! Shoot Julia! Julia, take cover. Andovi! I can do this all day. Idiot! Shit! I just started playing. And now it's three on three. Andovi thinks he's so smart. Okay. Jul, listen to me. Scream. What, now? Julia! Tom? Tom! Julia! Three against two. You told me to scream so you could shoot Tommy? How could you? -Jul! -Tommy! Tommy, are you okay? Tommy-- Idiot. Two on two. -Hit! -Hit! -Julia. -Tommy. Whipped. Kir! Come. Gosh. -What? -Give me bullets. -What? -Give me bullets! Cilla! Back me up. Cilla, back me-- Cilla? Be brave, and cover me. What? -Jo, I love you-- -Not now. We're playing paintball. Just shoot me. -Kir! -Kir! Sorry, Jo! Hit! Baby? Baby! You shouldn't shoot randomly, Baby. So annoying. It's my first time playing. But that's not my fault. -Aren't you going to help me? -It's just a game, Baby. So no? What do you want? Give me some bullets. We'll count to ten to walk back to our places. That's fair. It's not my fault that you ran out of bullets. Seriously? Okay, fine. Thank you, Baby. -Let's count to ten. -Okay. One… -You shouldn't have given me bullets. -You knew I'd say yes. You cheated. Cheated? I don't see any rules against cheating. -The rain… -Kirana, wait! We had a deal. -What deal? -The one we had discussed! How can I ever trust you again? Gosh, Andovi. How is this about trust? I trusted you completely, Kir. And look at me now. I lost. My team lost, all because of you! It has always been like this. Because of you, a lot of people have suffered. Andovi. I can't hurt the people around me anymore. No. No! I'm not going to hurt myself anymore just for you. Come on, Baby. I need some time. -Julia. -Yes? I bought a car. What? -I got a car. -Why didn't you tell me first? Because I wanted to get it. -What about our wedding? -We'll find the money, Julia. How? We're only days away. We have to pay the vendors. -I've paid the down payments myself-- -I don't care! What's important is that, finally, I got what I wanted, Julia. You don't want to get married? I didn't say that. I'll tell my parents. Julia. -Jul, where are you going? -To cancel my wedding. Tommy, go after her! Okay! Tom. How did this happen? -Where is Julia going? -To cancel her wedding. Andovi and Kirana are breaking up. You and Jo are the only ones left. I'm gonna try and talk to Julia. Cill! Wait… Jo, are you… Kir? Kir, about Andovi, are you… Okay. -Excuse me, Chandra? -Why are you here? It's nice to have a pillow. Have you brushed your teeth? Go brush your teeth. Where? Go through my bedroom… to the bathroom. There's a pink toothbrush. That one's mine. There's a new one next to it. That's for you. -Be right back. -Okay. You'll never forget this night. -Have you told Cilla? -Yes. And? Can we talk about it later? Jo. I've been waiting for this moment… for two years. I've only known you two weeks. Did you forget? Why don't you ask Chandra? He might remember. Now? My phone is outside. You're right. The first rule of the escape room. No phones in the escape room. Van. What's going on? Van. -Did you really forget, Jo? -About what? Don't remember this night? One, two, three. I'm taking her to your place. Go to your own place! Cilla is at my place! Jo, I have to go home. You are the girl of my dreams. You're my future wife. Everyone! Meet my future wife! You are the girl of my dreams. How did you find out about this class? This person has been messaging me. She leaves comments on our posts. -Why did you create this class? -I study psychology. I want to help people, so that they won't be whipped. My friend's band was playing. I arrived when you were singing. Before today, I already knew that your relationship had problems. I like you. Van. Why are we in an escape room again? Did Vania drug us again? Hey, Vania! Why is it just the three of us? Where's the key? Welcome to the last escape room. That's Indra. The last escape room is the hardest of all, because if you fail to escape this room, your relationship will end. An hour ago, I also contacted Julia and Kirana. Julia is on her way to her parents' house to cancel the wedding. Kirana is waiting for Andovi to make a decision about their relationship. What should I tell her? Van. I'm sorry. Sorry? Is that it? You're a liar! You played with my feelings. But now… you're going to play my game. You have two choices. First choice. I send Cilla all proof about that night. Don't. But your friends and brother will be safe. Or… you may prefer the second choice. I don't say anything to Cilla… but Andovi's relationship ends, and Tommy's wedding gets canceled. Let's hope Jo makes the right decision. -Ten minutes left! -This is a joke, right? Listen! There must be another way! Everything has been going according to Vania's plan. But this is illegal. You have all signed contracts. Being drugged isn't in the contract! Didn't you read? With extreme methods. Being drugged? You'll pass out for two to three hours, which is definitely better than not being able to love for years. Chan, wake up. Chan! -Come on, wake up. -What? Why are we here again? It's a long story, but now we're stuck. -We have to wait for Jo. -Why do we have to? Eight minutes! Why do we only have eight minutes? My wedding is getting canceled, because Julia-- -You want to pour your heart out now? -Gosh! You have eight minutes left! I don't want to cancel the wedding! Van. Please stop. Stop. Don't you realize, Jo? You've hurt me. You've hurt Cilla too! Van. Well, maybe you've hurt her more. Van. This is all my fault. Please don't bring others into it. Your decision will affect the others. This isn't fair. What did you just say? Fair? Because of you, I can't trust men, Jo! Why would you study love after all this time-- Do not speak about love in front me! Calm down. No, I can't. Guys. I'm a master of escape rooms. Chan, it's about me and Julia. -Three minutes! -Oh, no. Three minutes? That's more than enough. I'm getting you out. -Hey! -Chan! Chan! Chan! Guys, help me kick down this wall. -Hey! -Chan, are you being serious? Chan, seriously? -Let's do it. -What are you doing? Two, three! I choose to save them. -You're putting others first. -Isn't that what you wanted? You won't forget this night, Jo. Jovial! -Hello? -Jo! Where are you? -At Vania's. You okay? -Yes. Okay. Guys, please, I was just helping Vania. So this escape room… I'm the master of escape rooms. Where are the pictures, Van? -I'm deleting them now. -I'm not that stupid. I've made backups everywhere. Hello. Who is this? Cill. It's me. Jo? -How are you? -I need to tell you something. Two years ago, I cheated on you. We had had a big fight. I was wrong, and I'm sorry. But I'm even more sorry… for my behavior lately. You can say anything that you want. I'll listen. I forgive you, Jo. I love you. I love you too. "I love you"? Give me that. Why did you say "I love you"? I love her, Van. I don't care if you love her. Cilla should not forgive you. You're an asshole, Jo! That's what love's about. Forgiving. Have you made up your mind? We… are over. I've realized… that you're not what I need. Andovi. Calm down. Where are you? I'll come and let's talk, okay? Kirana. I'm… not… whipped. Hello? Baby. Why are you calling? -What else do you want to cancel? -That wasn't me! It was someone else! I joined this anti-whipped class. -What? -I can explain later. But please forgive me for buying that new car. Please don't let this ruin our wedding. I want to marry you. Please. Let's find a better time. Julia loves Commy. Commy loves Julia. That's more like it! Oh no, I'm late! Hey! Congratulations… Mr. and Mrs. Da Lopez! Way to go, Jovial! Even though I was supposed to go first… I'm still happy for them both. A little bit about Jo. Jo is such an honest man. Right, honesty is key. Chan, stop cutting me off. Be patient! Patience is key. And don't forget. Courage is key. Baby, can you come with me to get some food? Just a second. I still want to be with my friends. Okay. Go right in the middle. -Eyes to the camera, everyone! -One, two… Perfect! Next. Take your places.
