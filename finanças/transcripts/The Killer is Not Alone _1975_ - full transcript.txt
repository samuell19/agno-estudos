I need to sleep during the day - and this gentleman, with that noise- - Come Theresa, and you Mr. Raymundo, - let's keep calm - I don't bother anyone, I'm working Yes, but you have to understand that you work at the same time Ms. Theresa is resting Well, she should work during the day like everyone else Fine, then you ask the director of the sanatorium If you wanted Mr. Raymundo, everything could be settled I could give you a room next to Mr. Juanito, he's out all day and you wouldn't bother anyone - I don't bother anyone - I know you don't, but if you were in the other room then Ms. Theresa could rest peacefully all day and there would be no cause for complaint - What a welcome we've given you - Don't worry I suppose they'll give you the room next to mine. You don't have a typewriter, do you? No, I'm very peaceful, I won't be a bother - Then welcome home - Thank you What do you think? The room is yours as soon as we move Mr. Raymundo's junk If you want to wash up, the bathroom is down the hall on the left In the meantime I'll get your room ready Go on, go already - Good evening - Hello I was going... - At the end of the hall, to the left - Thank you - Yes, Mr. Nieto - Mr. Enrique, the director? - Of course the director - And who is calling? - Julio Nieto - His son? - Yes, put me through - One moment please Hello? Your father isn't in the office, would you like to leave a message? No, forget it Hello Carmen. Good afternoon everyone Thank you The Wire Strangler's St club Crime There are no prints from the killer I didn't have time to say goodbye to you but I'll try to call as soon as possible, these have been some very difficult days for me Oh Enrique, your son called - What did he say? - He wanted to speak with you Sounds like he's having a good time, I suppose he wanted money - Do you know if he called from Madrid? - Yes, that's what he said, or from Malaga, I didn't hear him too well Did he leave an address? - What was that? - Did he leave an address? - Oh, no, not with me - You didn't ask him what was going on, - why he left home? - It's your turn You know why he left, I don't know why you're so worried The boy found some girl he likes and gone to see her Carmen, please. What did he say? What? I already told you, he wanted to speak to you He's bound to call tonight once we're asleep, anything to be a nuisance What was that friend of his called, the one who shot so well? What was his name... do you remember? - The Sancherios' son? - Yes, that's the one Wait... - Why do you want to know? - Because he might have spoken with Julio Carlos, no no, Ernesto Sancherios Come on Rosita, give me a little more Later, once I'm done with everyone else Women always refuse by default, no matter what And you Mr. Juanito, always the same thing on your mind - Me? What did I say? - As if we didn't know you What's that laugh about? It's obvious, you're always chasing skirts, - all the girls at your office are terrified - This smells like a conspiracy, Ray Anderson here has already begun investigating Let's settle down. How is the case going Mr. Raymundo? You're not about to find out, I'm not saying another word - Why not? - Because later you won't read the book We didn't plan to read it anyway, he tells us every detail of his books during mealtimes Well, that's why You solve cases very well in your little novels, but as for real crimes, you haven't solved a single one That's what the police are for And where would the police be without you? It seems to me that in the case of the Habiles monster, neither you nor the police are making progress Did you see the picture of that poor girl in the newspaper? Why all this unpleasant talk around the dinner table? Unpleasant? Why? These are all facts of life They're things for a madmen, for a sexual maniac Please, the girl is here - Don't tell me those types are uncommon - You'd know that best Look how well the little girl understands these things - Monica has a right to an opinion, right? - Keep quiet Monica, let your elders speak Let's see if Mr. Raymundo decides to tell us his deductions. Don't make us beg, you're the expert on the subject The truth is that nothing is known because nothing can be known - The oracle has spoken - And nothing can be known because these sorts of crimes consist of very complex clinical oddities I'd say that every killer creates his own bloodline, he is born and dies by himself, he resembles no other But the police must know something by now The only thing they know is that he murders his victims with a wire So what? Where's the motive? The motive is the wire we'll have to balance on in order to find the killer Like I said, in these sorts of crimes the motives are hidden, secret, mysterious There is no previous relationship between the victim and her executioner Alright, but does he rape them before or afterwards? Please, let's not go there - Go on - It's a very simple matter These sort of crimes belong to a disordered mind... - Hello Ernesto, thanks for coming - It was nothing Listen, has it been long since you've seen Julio? Saw him? Well, two weeks ago, but I haven't spoken to him since last summer Did something happen, did you stop being friends? He must be upset, since the incident at the shooting club, he hasn't wanted to see us What happened at the shooting club? Did something happen to Julio? - Well, I don't know, he left home - Why? I have a few suspicions, that's why I called you Tell me Ernesto, what happened at the club that day? What exactly happened? Well... it was at the beginning of this summer We had spent the afternoon at the shooting club Julio was in a good mood and was having fun with everyone When we rejoined the group Sarah took him aside, she wanted to give him a gift I liked Sarah. Well, it was nothing important, she was a likable girl, pleasant, but she preferred Julio, that's why she took him to the cabin I don't know what happened, but a bit later she ran out, very scared All she did was cry, not answering my questions She cried and cried in a fit of hysteria. - She seemed very frightened - Why, what did she say? Tell me, what did Julio do to her? She didn't want to tell me anything. I asked him, but... - And you didn't see anything else? - No, nothing, just what I said It was a long time ago, I don't think he'd leave home because of that Have you heard anything from him? Where is he? Is it your size? It suits you very well - I'll wear it home - What do you mean you'll wear it home? - No? - It'll itch - Then I'll take it off - Fine Just imagine it, since my father died I've provided for the family. I don't mind helping, but I need my independence Naturally, your mother has to understand Yes, but you know how people become more selfish as they grow older And now she's gone back to dancing, you know? She was an important dancer when she was young, but she left it all when she married my father She says I have talent, just picture that, with me being as clumsy as I am Come on - What sort of things do you like? - Excuse me? Well, do you like to read? Sports? What are your hobbies? I'll tell you a secret, what I like most in the world are frankfurter sausages I like them like crazy, I eat them at all hours And rhinoceroses, my father has the best collection in the world What else do you like? Well, besides sausages and rhinoceroses, I like sports, traveling... - Alone? - Yes, alone You seem very reserved. You like solitude I think we'll get along well, I don't like noisy people at all, ones who talk too much I don't like those sorts of people either, I prefer peace and quiet Then we understand each other, we have the same tastes, aside from the rhinoceroses You're still like that? Go get me the platter - Can't Rosita bring it? - No, Rosita has a lot to do Go get it I said, immediately! Bream every Sunday, beautiful? If you don't like the menu stay at the Ritz - What are you doing? - Look Get out of here pig - What's the matter, are you crazy? - Beat it! What's all the ruckus? Morals are fine, but that guy's a prude - I didn't do anything to him - I know Sarah, I know, - I would never think of blaming you - But- I already told you, I'm worried about Julio and perhaps you can help me Ernesto told me what happened at the cabin. Why did he get upset with you? He insulted me, said some horrible things But why? There must be some reason. Did anything strange happen? Julio was in a good mood when he arrived with Ernesto. I called him aside I think he liked me because other times... well, I'd noticed he looked at me, understand? He didn't treat me like the other girls in the group. I like Julio too, he was so timid, so courteous I've thought about it many times, but I can't find a reason for his absurd reaction He started insulting me in a hateful way, no one had ever said things like that to me He insulted me, he said some horrible things, horrible, but I hadn't offended him. He said I was like Martha, just like Martha he said But I don't know Martha. Who is she? Martha? I don't know who Martha is, I don't know Wait, where are you going? - Let go of me - No, wait, come here a minute - Don't leave, let me explain - There's nothing to explain - Wait. You won't say anything? - Who would I tell? Mrs. Dolores and everyone else at the hostel Don't worry, I won't say anything You're a good boy, you can be trusted - I have to go - What's the rush? Look, let's do something. Drink your whiskey and wait until closing, - it will only be 10 minutes - No, I'm leaving Don't be silly, it's my treat It's a way of celebrating our secret Don't make that face Don't you like me? Don't be afraid, I won't bite The zipper So you're Martha You were a student back then and took care Julio all summer when my wife and I took a trip to Japan - Do you remember Julio? - Yes, but it's been so long... What happened back then? What happened between you and Julio? Nothing Why do you say nothing? He remembers you - That's his business - And mine, and yours as well What happened? It would be better for you if you told me now Nothing happened, I just took care of him I warn you Miss, it's useless to keep denying it, because I'll find out one way or another I don't know what you're talking about What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about? He remembers you and I'm sure it's not for a pleasant reason I don't know what you're talking about So you're refusing to tell me Talk already! What happened? - You're hurting me mother! - What do you mean? Stop whining - Arms high, the waist like this - Let's forget this, you're hurting me and I don't like it While you're still a minor you have to obey me girl, so you can get those thoughts of independence out of your head - My god Mother, again? - Don't take that tone with me, and listen to me when I'm speaking to you. You think you can go around doing what you please? - Let's not exaggerate things - I don't exaggerate girl, I know what I'm saying and I know what's good for you and I don't like you messing around with that boy at all - But Mom... - No buts, I've seen together more than once I know what you're going to say, that he's handsome, that he's well educated, but you're not old enough to think about boyfriends, and him, he's a man, I bet he even has a formal girlfriend, he's just using you - Using me? - Yes Poor thing I don't like you speaking to me that way What do you know about men, about life? The only thing I know is that he's alone, and he needs me I bring fresh news Mr. Emerson. Here's a report from a psychiatrist who confirms the connection between those crimes It's, as you had supposed, the work of a single killer, of a madman, a sex maniac, that's what the interview says - Then poor Theresa was... - Yes ma'am, just look at where our nurses night shift has led things What sort of madman Mr. Raymundo? Evidently a sex maniac The relationship between the crimes is that all the victims were prostitutes It's more than likely that the killer, from what we can deduce from this interview, suffered a traumatizing experience in his infancy or adolescence What was that? An especially unpleasant premature sexual experience, with a woman who mocked his manhood, for example But such an experience wouldn't cause a normal man to become a killer The thing is that these types aren't men at all, as soon as they find themselves with a stacked lady they don't even know the first thing to do - You understand, right? - Stop talking nonsense In the first place, these sort of subjects exhibit a schizoid personality that is to say, there's a division in their personality, so when they commit the crimes they don't act in a way that's controlled by their consciousness, but dominated exclusively by that other part of them ruled by their subconscious and in which there dominates negative experiences and the repressed anxieties of their infancy That's all well and good, Mr. Doctor, but is there evidence or not? In the newspapers the other day they said they had found some prints or something, - and the watchman... - It's true, the watchman saw the monster The bad thing is that as I said the other night, with this type of crime... Why don't you go to the police? I can't, I can't do it His mother would go crazy if she knew the police was looking for him, this is a private matter... it has to be private Look for him as discretely as possible, we just want him to come back home Every day there are more boys running away. - Did you bring the pictures? - Here they are, I've made 20 copies It would help if you gave me some information. His habits, how tall is he? He's 1.76, blonde hair, blue eyes, strong He likes to eat frankfurter sausages anywhere at any time, and also... he collects rhinoceroses What? Rhinoceroses? Yes, I do too, it's our hobby, they aren't real, they're made out of different materials If you know some place they sell them... What a surprise, it's the prettiest one I have! And it's so hard to find them, it's marvelous! How did you get it? What does it matter? The important thing is you like it I wasn't sure if I should get this or a can of sausages A coffee please Waiter, give me a coin - Yes? - Mr. Enrique, I've found him - Is he alright? - Yes What is he doing? He's very well, with a stunning girl next to him I'll be there immediately. What's the address? Close to your hotel, at the bistro in the town square Don't lose sight of him for a moment, and don't tell anyone. I'll be right out Mr. Enrique! Look, there he goes Julio, who was that? Why are they looking for you? It's not important, it's nothing Will you tell me? Don't grow up Monica, don't grow up, don't become an adult But I am an adult But not like the others, don't grow up Tell me, who was he? Why was he calling you? He's been looking for me, he's looking for me But who is he? - My father, he's looking for me - Why? What did you do? I don't know what I did I was just a boy. She was like my mother, you know? She tricked me She tricked me, you know? She tricked me It was Martha, Martha tricked me My parents had gone on a trip and she was looking after me She took care of me, and I think... that I loved her more than my own mother because she was always playing with me and told me marvelous stories But she tricked me, Martha tricked me Don't ever become a woman, don't be like her, like all of them We'll forget everyone and everything. They won't find us If you hadn't yelled... But why did he run? You said he loved you very much We'll find him soon enough, more than 12 men are looking for him, we'll find him again Something happened to him, there's no doubt, something terrible I think it'd be best to call the police No! Not the police, I'll find him myself That's where that goes, let's see how you deal with that bridge Mr. Gonzalo Well boy, you soon got tired of studying - May I speak with you a moment? - Of course, but wouldn't you prefer a game? - Dr. Gonzalo, can you help me? - Me? With that? Well, that family you spoke about, - those cousins of yours in Colombia... - Yes, what about them? They have factories, businesses, mines, they must need an engineer What for? They need educated people in those countries Well now boy, what are you trying to tell me? Fresh news gentlemen, the game draws to a close for the killer, as Mr. Emerson would say There's a picture there of the strangler done from the watchman's description - What do you want? - Where's Monica? Monica is working, son You have to help me Monica, you have to help me, you said you'd run away with me Calm down Julio, of course I'll go with you No, you won't come. You're like all of them, you want to trick me Don't be crazy, why would I trick you? I love you and I'll do what you say - You'll come with me? - I'll go wherever you want, don't worry Listen Julio, you have no reason to worry, you have me We'll leave, away, far away Yes, of course, far away from here, wherever you want my love, but don't worry Now go. Leave through there - You gave me quite a scare son - Forgive me ma'am - I ironed your shirt and I was fixing this - I'm sorry to be a bother It's not bother, it's a pleasure. I love having guests as clean and well educated as yourself If you knew what we have to endure in this business Look at poor Theresa. Who would have imagined? Anyway son, that's life, everything's a worry If you're not too busy I'd like to talk a bit, could we? - As you wish - You see, I work so much, worrying all day about how this business is going, and to look after you well And then there's Monica, you don't know how much work a daughter is, Monica is still a girl. It's been so much work to bring her up Just look. I became a widow very young with a babe in arms, she's the only thing I have in the world, her You shouldn't worry about Monica, - she knows how to take care of herself - That's exactly what worries me most, her independence She doesn't need me like before, and I'm going to be left alone. You don't know how frightening loneliness is Of course I know No, you're still young. I'm young too, though a daughter like Monica ages one before their time Don't you understand? All of a sudden everything hits you, the children grow up and you're left alone, completely alone, I don't want this to happen to me, you know? Come, don't be a child Help! Help! It's the killer! I think it was around here, Mr. Enrique Do you think my son is..? - Is the owner here? - What do you want? Please, it's very urgent, we need to talk to the owner Yes, yes. One moment Are you the owner of the hostel? I'm a private detective, Julio's father He tried to kill me! He pulled out a wire! Alright, you know what you have to do Yes? Hello Julio Yes, of course you woke us up, along with everyone else - I'm very sorry - It doesn't matter It's him, he wants to speak to Monica Call her, but don't put her on until we've left Let's go - Listen, can I- - No, leave it to us, the girl will take us to where he is. Please - Julio - I couldn't call you sooner, forgive me Don't worry Yes I know Alright Very well Why did you run away again? Everyone was there, your father- My father? What? Did you see him? He showed up at the hostel, I don't know how What did he say? What did my father say? I don't know, it was all very confusing. He spoke to me, he was desperate What did he think of me? Does he know? - He just said he needed to find you - No, not now, I don't want him to see me like this, for him to think- - What did you do Julio? - Nothing, I haven't done anything, - or are you going to hound me too? - No Julio, please, trust me, tell me everything. Are you sick? Yes, like that, cry my love, don't worry about anything I'm with you and you can tell me anything - Please, let me in! - Please ma'am - Let me in, my daughter's in danger! - Calm down, calm down He has my daughter Monica, he's going to kill her! Please,get into the car Be very careful, he wanted to kill me. Be careful Translation Turdis June 2010
