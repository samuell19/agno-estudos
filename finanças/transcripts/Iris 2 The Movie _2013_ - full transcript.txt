Check point M6 and secure area S5. Move it. We're scoping Area S5. No sign of him yet, sir. They pretended to be contacting from HQ. The other inmates are fine. Only Baek San escaped. I want to speak to Chief Park Joon-han. Is it possible? NSS CAMP You came? Baek San. From the mid-'70s, he worked his way up the Korean CIA. Practically all the dangerous operations were made by him. Former Director Baek San's file, can I see it? Why? Need something? Just think it'd be good to know. Too bad, pal. It's sealed up good by orders from upstairs. It's too bad meeting like this. Director Baek. It's been a long time. Seems like nothing's changed much here. Why did you surrender to NSS? Isn't it your job to find out? Fine. We'll stop here for today. Don't expect the same courtesy next time. Director Baek. IRIS SAFE HOUSE, KOREA I feel stuffy being trapped for long. I'd like some fresh air. Is it possible? Soon, there'll be a South-North summit in Hungary. It's where North Chairman Yoon was assassinated four years ago. Why there? Why gather to a place where they once failed? Just like us, the North has two factions, Hawks and Doves. The Hawks are tough militants. The Doves are civilian reps. They want to talk after succeeding in long-range missile launches. The two factions are different. The two representatives for the Hungary summit… will be from the Doves. From the South, it'll be former President Cho Myung-ho. Why are you giving me this information? I'm just repaying you for saving my life. Listen. I don't know if the target is the South, the North or both. But something will go down in Hungary. BUDAPEST, HUNGARY Go check Point B in Area A5. They're in the meeting hall. Thank you for coming. Nice to meet you. Me too. I'm Kwon Young-chan. Shall we sit? There are many issues to discuss. It seems there's much emphasis on the nuclear issue. We launched the Eun-ha missile, but you launched that Naro rocket. Rather than playing that up, let's talk about economic issues. We'll take a more careful look. Anyway, I'm glad to see many approaches to the issues. Me too. Thank you for being so understanding. Okay. That's it. Okay. Anything in particular? Besides claiming economic support in advance, they seem satisfied. Summits, family reunions, tourism, the Gaeseong Industrial Complex… Has money ever not come first? Besides that… Kwon doesn't seem to have anything against a free economic system. Must have some enemies. You think? Those with power are always against change. North Korea is no exception. Commissioner? It's okay. I've brought the Commissioner's shirt. We need to search you first. What is it? She brought your shirt, sir. Send her in. Welcome, Mei. I had your shirt washed, sir. I'm sorry about earlier. This room has a great view. The sunrise is even more beautiful. If you'd like, I can show it to you. Would that be okay? Of course. She took the Commissioner's shirt to his room, sir. She went into his room? Yes, sir. Wrap up here and check on tomorrow's security. Yes, sir. Is he inside? Yes, but he's with a female hotel staff. I know. Move. May I come in, sir? Who are you? Are you with IRIS? Guess. Location of the gunshots? Fifth floor! The North! Our VIPs' safety comes first! You two follow me. You go check on the North! Are you okay, sir? Get her! I want her alive! The windows! Close the curtains! Looks like the US felt betrayed big-time. Why are they so uptight? It's not like South and North talked about war. They just talked in hopes for a peaceful reunification. The surrounding countries in the six-party talks want to be informed of the talks and give approval. I guess from their standpoint, they could feel betrayed. I was going to send Captain Jung. He had enough assignments. Siem Reap in Cambodia. -Know who he is? -Yes. The man we lost in Hungary. Good. He went west from Hungary to Kazakhstan, India, Vietnam, and is now in Cambodia. But how'd you know? As the Vice-Director, I'm giving you a solo job. Bring him to me. Don't lose him to anyone. ANGKOR WAT, CAMBODIA Something happened in Hungary like he said. Shouldn't we do something? How about bringing him in for a questioning? The Director said he'd take care of him. Let's wait and see. They gave us vacations. How about the sea? The sea? What's that? Not sure. Let's go find out. Let's go! -Happy? -Yes. It's been fun. I'm too scared to fight. Let's just call it a day. Mister! Let's stop fighting! It hurts! Okay! I give up! Come here! Are you okay? I think it's bleeding. -Let's see. -It hurts. Here. It's bleeding like crazy. -Here! -Where? Fooled you! Catch me if you can! Where are you going? Man, hotels are the best! Nice tub and everything! Hey. How about getting some room service? I want a Caesar salad. M2 CX9. I've secured the target. Go to the embassy at Norodom. They'll prepare your return. Watch him closely till you get on our plane. I'll be back tomorrow morning. Nice! Open your eyes. I know you're awake. Open them. Come on. Hey! Uncuff me! Hey! This is insane! Shut up, fool. Don't go! I gotta use the toilet! Uncuff me, man! Stay still. I'll be right back. Hey! How can I? I'll shit my pants! Uncuff me, you rookie! Use Baek San as bait? Will IRIS take it? Absolutely. They're desperate to get something from Baek San. What could that be? What does IRIS want to get from Baek San? Only Baek San has the key. Attention! During tomorrow's operation, our team's office will be shut. No one can go out and no outsiders can come in. Get ready. Make no mistakes. Prepare thoroughly! Understood? Yes, sir! Know how foolish it is to use me as bait against IRIS? I want answers to at least one of two things today. Who's the traitor within NSS? And what IRIS wants from you? I appreciate your cooperation. Gladly, sir. -We're heading out. -Okay. It's 10:30 a.m. Mother bird has left the nest. Get to work! Traffic system accessed. Signals controlled. Their location? Zoom in! -Major 10 has entered A7. -Okay. Surveillance cams accessed. Entering the base! Transfer operation has begun. Be careful on your side too. Yes, ma'am. F1, report status. F1, all clear. I'd like to speak to Vice-Director Choi Min. It's very important. What are you trying to get in exchange for me? Think we'd do anything foolish against IRIS with you? Anyway… Why'd you want to see me? You said you wanted to know what IRIS wants and why I surrendered to NSS? I'll tell you what IRIS wants from me. F1, ten minutes left. Concentrate! Yes, sir. The first van is under attack! They fell for it. Move as planned! We created nuclear bombs greater than the one used on Hiroshima. They were hidden underground in several places in Seoul. If the North ever started a war and took over Seoul, they'd detonate the bombs and demolish the enemy's HQ. For over 30 years, I'm the only one who knows where the nuclear bombs are hidden. What IRIS wants from me… are the five nuclear bombs. Yoo-gun! Yoo-gun! Yoo-gun! Focus! Report status. Three of us injured, and 17 IRIS members killed. But they took Captain Jung and are on the run. -Jung? -Yes. Tell me, were Jung and Soo-yeon more than colleagues? Yes. Why do you think I surrendered to NSS? I did my best for our country's security. As I said before, my allegiance is to our country. What do you think IRIS wants from me? They want to take the nuclear bombs and start a war. And I'm trying to stop that catastrophe. For now, NSS will have to protect me. Looks like you didn't inform the President about the bombs. You're right. I'll report when I'm sure. Don't. It'll just bring about massive chaos. Within NSS and the Blue House, there are still IRIS spies. For now, let's just keep this between us. ONE YEAR LATER IRIS SAFE HOUSE, JAPAN What do you think? Will they hand over Baek San to save you? I don't know what you fools want from Baek San. But the NSS… won't give up Baek San for me. Jung Yoo-gun is alive? I'm glad to hear that. But I won't take part in a hostage exchange. I feel the same. We don't negotiate with terrorists. But… it's time to keep your promise. I informed the President about the nuclear bombs. So if we move in secret, you must show us the nuclear bombs. I'll set the date soon. I'll be ready. you'll die by my hands. We'll have two snipers here and also here. Also two divers on standby at Point R. When the exchange is complete, Baek San will jump into the sea. Then our snipers and agents will start firing. Then, arrest the culprits. What about Baek San? The diving agents will take him to Point X. Sounds like a good plan. But it all came from Baek San's head? Yes. I'm against it. We don't even know what Baek San has yet. Who'll be responsible if the operation fails? I will. We know Baek San has no plan of returning to IRIS. If he did, he wouldn't have surrendered to us. It's clear he still needs our protection. If you're so sure, I'll trust you on this one. But if something goes wrong, you'll pay. Get ready. Position check. SP1, ready. It's 11:23. Snipping setup complete. Target approaching at eleven o'clock. And the rescue divers? They've been on standby for an hour. Okay. Thirty seconds remaining. Don't forget our promise. I'll never go back to IRIS. Captain Ji? Check on Baek San at once. Yes, ma'am. Over here! He's dead. Yoo Joong-won speaking. Did you find Baek San? Still searching, sir. Then our business is over. I'll handle this! If you support me, I'll find his nukes and hand them over to you, all except one. For what use? I'll burn up Seoul and start a war for reunification. Find Baek San. Then, I'll think about it. Yes, sir. Thanks. JAMSIL AREA 10 UNDERGROUND CULVERT USE RADIATION DETECTOR. I KEPT MY PROMISE - BAEK SAN JAMSIL AREA 10 Get the tactics and explosive teams ready. And be discrete. Request the police to block off the underground entrance. Yes, ma'am. Brought the radiation detector? -Yes, ma'am. -Okay. When was the Main Stadium built? It was built in 1976. It's quite old. This way. Watch your heads. Vice-Director? The level is going up slightly. This is it. Open it. There are four bombs. This was unexpected. What is the plan you have in mind now? We must first retrieve the last bomb Baek San has. NSS is working on that, sir. I'm asking about the four bombs we found. What do you think about them? The Korean Peninsula must be denuclearized. We should inform the US and dispose them. It's already established the North has nuclear weapons. Will insisting denuclearization alone work? The Agency for Defense Development say they can set them on missiles. With all of North Korea at range. Disposing them or using them as weapons, what is best for our country? Mr. President. If you're the man I knew long before, I'm sure you think the same. Peace doesn't come easy. With unbalanced power, it'll be harder to maintain peace. It may be better for us to have nuclear weapons too. A team from NIS and NSS can co-manage the nuclear bombs. I have a report, Director. What is it? The Vice-Director is moving the nuclear bombs from ADD. -What? -To where? I called ADD. She just left there. With all four? Yes, sir. I'm the one in charge of them. Where is she taking them without permission? To Camp Humphreys, sir. The Vice-Director… will give them to the US army. Go stop her at once! Return the nuclear bombs. Arrest her! Bring her here! Choi Min is stripped of her title! Hurry! Yes, sir. What are you doing? What are you doing, Vice-Director? This is not your place to step in. No. I don't care how the nuclear bombs will be used. My job is to stop movement of them without permission. You've gone overboard, Choi Min. Possessing nuclear weapons breaks our agreement with the US. Are you Korean or American? I'm not here as a Korean or an American. I'm just trying to stop a future catastrophe. How long must we rely on allies for our country's security? With nuclear weapons, we won't be played by the North! Keep nuclear weapons to avoid a war? You really think that's best? Best or not, it's not for you to decide! You tried to hand them over without the President's permission! You are now a traitor! Put your gun down. If you want to die together, just say it. If you follow quietly, I'll show you something. Remove the carpet. Report to Black. Speak. I've located the nuclear bomb, sir. But he's holding the detonator. Is Baek San with you? Put him on. They were unnecessary. I needed to be sure. What is the switch you're holding? Thinking of blowing yourself up? It's the only weapon I have. Your hideout is within the 10 km range, so don't try anything. You'll blow up with me. Already knowing where I am, you're good. Come on over. Let's go. Use the nuclear bomb in a more productive way. You'll blow up a cottage to get rid of little old me? No need to underrate yourself. With you gone, there'll be a big setback in IRIS' plans. The nuclear bomb exploding there won't affect IRIS' headquarters. You know better than that. Oh, really? Then… there's no need for this. Wait. There's an intruder, sir. Someone's on your tail. Make your choice. Baek San! People are about to be blasted by a nuclear bomb! Like you said, your greed to have nuclear weapons clouded your judgment. This switch… I never said it'd blow up the nuclear bomb. Why you… Baek San! No! -No! -Move! Shoot me first! Move! Stop it! You think there's an end to all this killing? She'll put you in danger someday, sir! -Stop! -Colonel! Stand down! Get the nuke. We're leaving. Move! You'll just let them go? This bomb is enough. Is the detonator ready? Yes, sir. Good. Yoo is set on using the missing bomb in Seoul. What do you mean? How can you be so sure? He's not using the nuke as bait like the North usually does. He wants to blow it up to start a war. I don't believe this. Get him no matter what! Get the tactics and EOD teams ready. Okay. A truck left here 15 minutes ago. Track it down. I'll search the streets coming into Seoul. With no tracking device, it'll take time. But they'll eventually find us. Found it! Where is it? This was just taken. They're in Seoul. Keep tracking them. I'll head out. Be careful. SEOUL JUNCTION -All set? -Yes. Let's go! Use the nuke as a shield! What happened? Brother! It was a success. Good. Get out of there! But I… Lee Hyuk-soo! They tricked us! Are you okay, sir? I can't be sad. He probably went down laughing. CLOSED FOR REMODELING This is a restricted-- Open the door. Cut off all network connections and shut down all entrances. There were five construction crew and two guards, sir. Good. Ki-joon? Yes, sir. Put men on every door. Report to me every ten minutes. Yes, sir. Park Tae-hee? Yes, sir. Get the detonator and heart rate sensor. Yes, sir. What do you mean, sir? I heard Mr. Black died. Reunification won't be easy without IRIS' help. If I blow up the nuke in Seoul… If blowing up Seoul will bring reunification, we would've fired missiles! We have 1.2 million soldiers! It's time to take action and show them! How long must we stop at making threats? I'll set off the flare for reunification. Allow me, sir! Fine. If you're so sure, do it! Did he approve? We will succeed! It's time to prove our loyalty to the Republic. It's not too late. Anyone who wants to go… can leave now. We got a tip on what could be Yoo and his gang's hideout. Where, sir? Banpo Bridge, Floating Island. Banpo Bridge? That's in Yongsan. Send everyone out there. And the Radiation Detection Team! I'll call them. We'll head out, sir. NSS and cops will be here soon. We expected this. When do we execute the operation, sir? Jung Yoo-gun will come for sure. A man like him will be a good companion to hell. You watch the security room. Some uninvited rats may swarm in. I'll kill on sight. Good. Make no mistakes. Now, go! -You two be careful! -Roger that. RDT found high radiation. The nuke is in there for sure. I don't see Captain Jung. Did he go in first? Probably. There's an incoming video. All the actors are gathered. It's time to start the show. Yoo Joong-won! If I press this switch, the nuclear bomb behind me will blow within five seconds! Whether this nuclear bomb is real or fake, you know better than anyone. I am the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's People's Armed Forces Colonel Yoo Joong-won. In the name of the Republic, I start a holy war of reunification of the two Koreas! Jung Yoo-gun! Stop. I've been waiting. Know what this is? It's a heart sensor detonator. Whether it blows by pressing this switch, or by my heart stopping. Everyone dies! If my heart stops, the countdown begins. In our next lives, let's see if we meet again, as enemies or as… friends. That won't bring reunification. Reunification at a cost of countless lives, what good is that? Reunification may be a burden for the rich! But to my people who've been ostracized from the world, this is the only way to survive. Don't delude yourself as their representative. It's just your grudge talking. Can't you see? My actions today will restore our People's trodden pride! And bring them hope. Stop it. Let's stop it. Why are you here? Go. Get out of here! Go where? Not without you. Let's go together. Then, I'll go. You can't be here! Go back! Stop being foolish and go! Yeon-hwa. Of all people… I know you'll understand me. I know. I have felt the same as you. But… now it's changed. Yeon-hwa! Joong-won… Let's not die. If you press that, I'll die too. Why? Let's live. Even if it's hard… let's live together… and get through it. Stay back! Listen! I'm here to fight for reunification and liberation of our people! Snap out of it! You're trying to kill countless innocent mothers and fathers! You were such a devoted son. Your mother wouldn't have wanted you to do this. Please… Think of your mom… and stop this. Please? Don't do this. This is wrong. Mother… Joong-won! No! Yeon-hwa… I'm sorry. Don't die on me! No… It's me. It's Jung Yoo-gun, sir. I have one last request, sir. Why do you have to go? They'll fly out to the sea and drop it. I want to end this. I want to make sure. Then I'll come with you. I'll be right back. Just think about what you want to have for dinner. -Yoo-gun. -Please… I'll be right back. Captain? Have a safe flight. I'll be back! Please get off. Yoo-gun! Yoo-gun? Come back. Drop it now and come back. Please… I beg you. Soo-yeon… Do you know? Because you're the one I loved, I was really thankful and happy. Tell me that directly in person, please. Ji Soo-yeon… Yoo-gun! No!
