[cell alarm buzzes] Hell. If they knew how much fun I was having in here, they'd let me loose. [dark suspenseful music] [gunshot] CHICAGO MASSACRE: RICHARD SPECK [dark dramatic music] [truck rattling] [lively banjo music] Let's go. Let's go. ♪ Widow Whitmore has a truck That Richard likes to steal ♪ ♪ I'll drive her to El Paso So that he can have a meal ♪ Heehaw! Richard! Good for nothing, evil son of a-- Give me my truck right now! I'm not stealing it. I just borrow it. -It's the third time in a week! -I'm just gonna borrow it. Richard, this time I'm calling the police! Do you see what happens? This is what happens! -I'm calling the police. -Oranges! -Stop! -I found some oranges! You ungrateful, no good kid! Oranges! -Oranges! -Richard! My lunch is in there! Would you like an orange, Widow Whitmore? Here, have an orange! -Here are your oranges! -They're going to lock you up! Bring it back! Don't forget your groceries! [lively country music] I'm going to call the police. Dammit! [laughs sadistically] Mr. Speck, I've had it up to here with your behavior. You've been arrested 36 times in the last two years. And you've been in my courtroom 15 times. -Nice to see you, Judge. -Miss Whitmore. Now, every time you've been able to willy your way out of trouble, but you ain't getting of that easy this time. Now, I'm a man who believes that any young man such as yourself, can clean up his act. I'm a firm believer, in rehabilitation, but it's this court's opinion that jail would only make you a harder criminal. So, I sentence you to a court ordered psychologist, who will evaluate you and in three months' time, report back to me as how best to keep you out of trouble. Mr. Judge, this boy-- -Mrs. Whitmore. -But Mr. Judge, this boy stole-- Mrs. Whitmore, I will not have you treating this court like a barn! You'll not call out at me! Yes, sir. Now, Mr. Speck, you'll report tomorrow morning to the Dallas County Regional Hospital, to begin your counseling. I advise you though, to make the best of your time. I never again, want to see you in my courtroom. Yes, sir. I mean, no sir, not in your courtroom. Never again. [chuckles] You can bet your horses on that. -Are you going to let him go? -Make sure. -Thank you sir. -Make sure. -I promise you. -This isn't a proper proceeding. -Widow Whitmore, my apologies. -You cannot let him go! -How will I feed my children? -Just relax. -It's all right. Come on. -He broke my truck! Don't worry, we'll take care of that. I can't feed my kids with a broken truck. -Do not worry. -You can set it free. [train whistles] [cattle bellowing] [train whistles] See you, CIifton, Texas. [sentimental country music] Well, well, well. Looks like I got my private train. [train bell rings] Perfect. [grunts with satisfaction] See you, CIifton, Texas. Hello, Chicago. [sentimental country music continues] [wood creaks open] Boy, didn't I tell you to never call your mother to work? I was just trying to tell her-- I don't care what you were trying tell her, I told you never to call her to work. If I told you once, I told you a million times, boy! That lady's working so we can survive, 'til I get back on my feet, Don't you ever do that again, boy. Ever. My dad told me that I could call her. [scoffs] Your papa? Your papa is dead. I'm your papa now, boy. You hear me, little one? I'm your papa. You're gonna listen to me from now on. You ain't my papa! You'll never be my-- -Come here. Come here! -laughs sadistically] I'm gonna be your papa, and you're gonna listen to everything I tell you. -Come here. -[boy grunts] I'm going to give you a lesson that your mom's never realized. Come here! [tranquil country music] [heavy city sounds] [woman] Richard! Richard! Hi! Hey, Sharon! From the bus ride. The advice you gave me, that was really helpful. Well, I don't know much, but, I do know a lot about relationships with your father. Yeah. Say would you mind if I were to take your number and maybe follow up on that advice? Oh, I ain't got a number, I ain't got a place to live right now. But I know where you live, so shouldn't t be a problem. How do you know where I live, Richard Speck? Well, you are a nurse at the college here, it must be that you live in the nurses' dorm. You're a smart man. It was good to see you. Yeah. I'll pop in on you sometime, when you least expect it. Okay. It was good to see you, Richard. -Take care. -I will. You are as beautiful as the day is long. Bye, Richard. And the day ain't long enough. [heavy traffic sounds] [sighs] [man talking softly] [sensual jazz music] Come on, Richard. Righty-ho. [jazz music continues] Sorry, another whiskey? Hey, Speck. Hey, hey! Drinking or are you leaving? -Three and a half minutes. -Three and a half minutes what? That's how long it takes. Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. You should probably work on making it last a little bit longer. I' ain't talking about the horizontal mambo, Harry. I'm talking about how long it takes to choke someone, three and a half minutes. Why would I give a rat's ass about how long it takes to choke somebody? It is the type of information that might come in handy one day. -You might need it. -Oh yeah? When did you need it? About… … three and a half hours ago. Okay, look, this ain't no hair salon. -It's a bar, follow me? -[laughs eerily] Nobody's gonna be asking any questions. Bobby Jay could walk in and say he killed Kennedy. I wouldn't care. You know why? Because it ain't my business to know. [jazz music continues] [eerie jazz music] [spectral voice of Richard] Wow, that was very special. [dark ominous music] [sentimental 60s music] July 13, 1966 [door clicks open] [door slams shut] [swaying 60s music] Hell's bells. Hello. Hello. -Sharon? -It's okay. Everything's okay. I was trying to get to New Orleans, but I got no money. -[scoffs] -[swaying music continues] I stopped. I don't know. Maybe you' all might be able to help me out. -[gun clicks] -[Sharon gasps] [Sharon gasping] Come on. [loud thud] -Go. Come on! -[Doris shrieks] Come on, quick! Right, calm down. I'm just here for the money, okay? Not that you don't look tasty in them nightgowns, -I ain't here for that. -[gun clicks] Other girls around here? Hm? It can't just be you two. All alone in this big, old dormitory. -All right. -[sniffs] Let's go find her friends. Come on! Come on. Move. [swaying music continues] [Doris sobs] Shh! -[sudden violent bang] -[nurses shriek] -[nurses moan] -I'm just funnin' ya. [giggles sadistically] I know your friend, all right? We're travelin' buddies. Get out of bed. Come on. Get out of bed! -[girls shriek and scream] -I'm not gonna hurt you. You too. -Let's go. -[girl sobs] -[girls sobbing] -Come on! Come on. -It's all right. -[girl panting] Let's go. [Richard] Shh. [keys rattle in door] -[girls shriek] -Shh. [hasty footsteps] [Bernice] Bye guys! [Bernice giggles] Hey girls. W-what's going on? -Smell like grapes. -[Bernice screams] -Shh. -[Bernice whines] [ominous music] [girls crying and sobbing] Shh. I ain't gonna hurt you. [slicing sounds] [old camera rolling] -[Barbara] We're rolling? -[ma] Yep, you're up. This is Barbara BiIIings, with WLAI. It is an awful sight and just a heinous crime. Eight nursing students were found this morning, in this dormitory behind me. Each apparently raped and murdered by various methods, -from stabbing to strangulation. -[woman cries bitterly] Come on. Keep rolling. Don't stop. We are not answering any questions… I just want to ask you a few. She's been sequestered, will not answer any questions. Do you know who it was? -M' am, do you know who it was? -Miss, please back off. -[crying continues] -Get them. Get them! [car engine starts] [door slams aggressively] [female footsteps] Mrs. Billings, please. I can't let you inside. Captain, come on. I just want to see for myself. -There are no cameras. -Not this one. Please. [reporter] Any comments? Captain Dunning, any comments? Whitaker, it’s about time you showed up. I was working the six other cases you piled on me this week. [Barbara whispers] -[Dunning] It's not good, sir. -Come on… Mrs. BiIIings, please! If you don't clear the crime scene, I'm gonna have to consider you a suspect! -Please. -All right. You might want to brace yourself before we go inside. After 30 years of investigating crime scenes, you think I need to prepare myself? This is particularly nasty. All right. Why don't you fill me in? I count eight bodies. -Eight bodies? -Yeah. All young girls, and they were all… … stabbed, strangled and raped. Please tell me that no one has infected the interior. No, we've been able to hold down forensics. Only myself and Harper and have been inside. Appreciate that, Joe. A survivors? Yes, one. A woman namedd Sondra Azano. She was able to hide under the bed during the entire attack, all night long. [Whitaker] Heavens. Did you get a statement? No. She was too historical for anything specific. She did say it was only one suspect. Unless there's anything else, I'll start m investigation. Yeah, well, considering I have race riots in South Chicago, I got a democratic convention coming in next week, I would appreciate it if you find this freak quickly and quietly. -You ready? -Yeah. Here we go. [Whitaker] Oh. [door slams loudly] [woman wailing] -[woman] screams -[chains rattle] [dark ominous music] [woman wailing] I know. I know. I'm Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I ain't never done anything like that to nobody in all my life, I swear to God. I'm sorry it had to be you. [woman cries despondently] I'm sorry. [ominous music intensifies] I'll do one for ya. I'll make it quick. -[woman gasping] -Okay? Well then, yes, just say a prayer This is your last mark. [ominous music intensifies] [Richard laughs] [gun clicks] [gunshot] [dark dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] You're a sick son of a bitch, Richard Speck. [dark dramatic music] Just have another fucking pee. [door squeaks open] [coughs with disgust] [Dunning sighs] Gruesome. Yeah. Honestly. I've never seen anything like it … ever. These women had families, friends, boyfriends… lives. They were gonna go out in the world and do extraordinary things. And some sick bastard comes and takes it all away from them. We gotta get this guy, Joe. And maybe… maybe the loved ones will… be able to find some sort of peace in that. What kind of animal does this? Jack. We've got some more bodies down the hall. God bless you, sweetheart. Brace yourselves. [sudden ominous music] Who would do such a thing? [heavy solemn music] Jack. There's more. [door shuts] [door shuts] I can't stand the odor. [heavy ominous music] [ominous music continues] All right. -Is that it? -Yeah.. They've all been stabbed multiple times. Judging by the angle of the wounds, our guy was right-handed. [Whitaker] Tied them all up. [girls whimpering] Took them away one by one, -and he killed them. -I ain't gonna hurt you. What do you say? What do you know? What's happening? Any theories? No rhyme, no reason. Jack. Jack. We gotta get an all-points bulletin out on this guy. Jack, let me make something absolutely crystal clear, okay? You have to catch this bastard before the word creeps out that there's a mass murderer floating around Chicago. Or all hell's gonna break loose. The city's already teetering on the edge I got Mayor Daly up my ass' if things get any worse. Captain, I don't give a crap what Mayor Daley thinks. What we have here this city, can affect us in a whole different way. Jack, you got three days. After that, I'm gonna have to pull the plug, and bury this investigation. -Joe, come on. -Politicians, writers, I can't add a mass murderer to the mix. You're not gonna close this case, Joe. Three days, Jack. -The case isn't going away, Joe. -Three days! Three days. Just make it your priority, please! Excuse me. Did the vic calm down enough to give us a description? She has, sir. She described him as wearing all black, tall-approximately 6’ 3”, blond hair, and uh… and most importantly, a severely acne-scarred face. That's good Harper. That's real good. Thankfully, we have something we can work with. Have an artist work up a sketch. I saw hand prints on the necks of the victims in there. See if the forensics can pull a print. Start questioning the student at the college. Someone has to have seen this bastard. Listen up, guys. We've got a mass murderer on the loose. We have to catch this animal before he strikes again. In all my years, I never saw anything, like the scene inside that dorm. I suggest, you take a walk through in there. See what another human being is capable of. And burn the images of those girls into your brains, so that you have as much to motive you as I do. -All right? -Yes sir. All right. [suspenseful music] Go see what the devil can do. I'm gonna get you, you son of a bitch. [suspenseful music intensifies] [suspenseful music continues] [rhythmic electric guitar music] Do you have a light, by any chance? My match is worked for shit. Yes, sir. Yeah, I found this cigarette over from Bali. I [indistinct] this shit. -Lucky you. -Mm-hm. Can't believe someone would throw away a perfectly good cigarette like that. Maybe there is a reason for it. You know what? I think you may be right. Harry. Could I get a real cigarette a shot of whiskey, and a pickle? -Could I have a soda, please. -Coming right up. -Want some whiskey in it? -No. -Here's yours. -Oh. Thank you. Do you have a light? [soft electric music] You look like one of those … airplane waitresses. -I am a stewardess, yes. - Get the fuck out of here!! You're a real stewardess? Harry, she's a real life stewardess. I heard. Wow! Oh… -Pickle. -[chuckles] What's it like being up there, in the air with the birds? It's really great once your ears stop popping. -Your ears pop? That's weird. -Thats the pressure. Hey, I'm under a lot of pressure. I guess my ears should be popping all the time. Yeah, this is my dinner. A pickle and some peanuts. That's like pregnancy food. Just needs some ice-cream. Do you want to get pregnant? Not until I have my MRS degree. What the hell is that? Married. [Richard chuckles] Ah, you are one of them goody two shoes. What do you like better? A little baby peanut, or a big old pickle? I don't like either. Oh, I love them both. I bet your panties would look nice wet. You can skip the soda. I'm sorry, Harry. What the hell's the matter with you? -If I can figure that out… -[laughs mockingly] … I can save my soul. -[phone rings] -[light suspenseful music] Jack, we just got a report from a liquor store owner. Jack, I know this case is horrible, but I've never seen you so personally by it. I knew one of them, Joe. Geez, I'm sorry, Jack. I had no idea. It turned out to be the daughter of an old college buddy I had. [heavy dramatic music] [phone rings] So, uh… did you tell his parents? Yeah. The hardest thing I've ever had to do. I don't know anymore, Joe. I'm kinda lost. I don't recognize this place anymore, I mean… I mean, is it us? Are we getting soft in our old age? It is a new generation. Ever since World War Two, people no longer value life. I don't know, Joe. I hope it is not that. I just think this guy is a scumbag, made just like Jack the Ripper and the Boston Strangler. You were saying something when you came in. Yeah, the newbie, Harper, he interviewed the owner of the liquor store. Just today, he said a guy fitting our description came in complaining about being double booked in the Marine Merchants' Union Hall. I figured you want to get right on it. [Whitaker laughs] Yeah. Go get him, Jack. Go get that son of a-- [ominous music] [door shuts] [soft jazz music] -[chuckles] -Detective Jack Whitaker. I advise you to get off the phone, ma'am. -I'm going to have to-- -Now! Yes. I'll talk to you later. Is this how you treat your union members? No sir, I was just-- I don't care what you were "just". All right. Now listen up. I've been back and forth across this town for three days and I am tired, damn tired. Now I'm here on a whim, so don't waste my time with lies, you got that? Tell me how this business works. Well, shipping companies let us know when there's a job available on the boats.. We contact the next union member on the list, After that, we show them to the correct docks. You ever double book your jobs? -Well-- -Hey look. I’m not the labor board. I’m not going to report you. Well, these men are not reliable. Often times we call them but they don't show up, And to protect ourselves, sometimes we'll book two members for the same job. Very often, I can find the other man a job. Has it happened recently? Yes, it happened a few nights ago. A man was very upset with me. He said he drove all the way from Dallas to find a job. -I told him the job was taken. -Dallas? Yes, sir. I told him that if he waited, I'd find him another job, but he didn't believe me. He screamed and yelled at me. In fact, I was so disturbed with this man, I tore up his paperwork and threw it away. Trust me, I understand how difficult it can be, but they all know the game. They know it's a crap shoot. Did he look something like this? There are some similarities. Do you still have your papers? I threw it in yesterday's garbage. Where's yesterday's garbage? Out back. Great. I'll meet you out back. How do I go? I go around the side here? -Yeah. -Right. -[soft jazz music continues] -[door shuts] [metal scraping sounds] [dog barking] It's right there. Right there. -This it? -Yeah.. -Is that the guy? -That's him. You may have just cracked this case. Hey, you gonna help me clean this up? Hey! The union don't cover this. [kicks trash] Joe, I found the son of a bitch. Speck. Richard Speck is his name. Speck? [phone rings] -How do you he's our guy? -I got his union papers. He matches the description perfectly. I spoke with Ms. Azano. She’s positive. Look Jack, your three days are up. I gotta pull some detectives from the case. -You're not serious? -No, I'm dead serious. I’m not about to lose my job wasting time over one creep. I need more help now I know his name, Joe, not less. Mayor Daly is on my ass about these damn race riots. You're obsessing over one guy. I could have 10 000 people dead in the streets. I'm obsessing? I'm doing my job. But just let the dust settle. This shit will rise to the top. No, he won't. He’ll be back in Texas before we know it. And you know we're not gonna get any help -from those lone rangers. -I gotta pull Bruschy and Harper from the case. -Sorry. -Fine, Joe. I don't need any help. Work with me, Jack, please/ [playful gangster music] [Richard] Now, that's what I call a Scotch. Let's play. Let's see if you do better than last time. Gotta eat these peanuts first. Peanuts make you strong. Watch here. Okay. Ready to blast off. [loud clang] Ah, do you see that? Oh, yeah! Dave! Three on a break! Might as well sit down, paint your toenails, pumpkin belly, I'm gonna be here for a minute. You talk to anyone else like that they take you outside and give you a whipping. No, they wouldn't. I'd introduce them to my girlfriend Mary. Mary? Who the hell is Mary? Oh, you ain't met Mary, huh? Let's see what we got. Any of you met my girlfriend Mary? -No, I don't think I have. -You wanna meet Mary? Doesn't sound like I gotta choice. You always have a choice. Choice is… … life or death. Are you ready for this? All right. [imitates western sounds] Ah, there's your high heels. [high pitched voice] Ding, ding, ding. [imitating quirky sounds] Sharp, ain't she? Yes, she takes care of all the business. Kept me nice and safe in 'Nam. Vietnam? I didn't know you were in 'Nam, Rich. Yeah, that's where I got this tattoo right here. Wanna raise hell? [chuckles] Oh, my stomach hurts. Think it's bad sauces. Let's see. Where's that shot? [Richard grunts] Hey, how you doing? Sir, you just found yourself the friendliest bar this side of Mason-Dixon. First drink's on me. Or, on the house, preferably. I gotta go drop the kids at school. [tranquil bar music] [door slams] I forfeit. -Hey, playing a game, here. -Put it on my tab. -Where'd your buddy go? -My who? The guy you were playing with. Where did he go? I think he went out to relieve himself or something. Come on. Hey. [rhythmic western music] [traffic sounds] [laid-back western music] I was down uh… walking around by the uh… … the new pickup truck… -Yeah. -…sales place, you know? And fat Bill was standing out front. You know Fat Bill? Standing out there, sweating like a stuck pig. So I stopped by. Started chatting with him, He goes on and on about his… his wife will just do whatever he tells her to do. I mean… … he went on about some things I won't repeat in front of you. But, I said to him, "That's part of a woman's duty right there. "To do as her husband says, "to make love to him whenever he wants, however he want--" You don't make love to me. Because you won't let me! You are too uptight! No, it's because you treat me like an animal, Richard. -[loud slap] -[woman shrieks] [woman screams] This is exactly what I'm talking about, Richard! It's exactly… you make me feel like I'm nobody, Like I don't mean nothing. You mean nothing. Your daddy is something. You ain't rich. He's rich. You are nobody, Richard. You are not a man. Are… -[loud bang] -You're-- No, no… -No, Richard, I'm sorry. -Do you want the boot? Richard, no, no! You want the boot, huh? Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Go away. -[screaming in terror] -No, Richard! Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Just let me be. -No… -About one boot. Just one. -No. - One little boot, huh? Go away. Go away. -Come on! -Go away. [weeping] Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to put the boot, right there. The boot's gonna watch us, make sure, you do whatever your husband wants you to do. Richard, no. He's gonna watch. Please, Richard, leave me alone. I am your husband. You know I wouldn't hurt you. [screams in terror] Please, Richard, leave me alone. What happens? -Yes, you want it hard. -No! You want it hard. Come on. This goes here … Ah, that's nice. Look at that. That's pretty. [kissing sounds] -Help! -Come on. I'm not an animal! Then quit acting like one. -[tranquil guitar music] Go. Give me a peanut. I'm warning you, Richard. Let me go. Let me go. I warn you. What are you going do, huh? Tell Daddy you don't treat me well. You won't tell your daddy nothing, because if you do, I'll tear your arms off and watch you bleed to death. [groans] This ain't right, Richard. It's not right for a husband to treat his wife like this. Guess I ain't your husband no more, huh? I'll be your daddy. And you have to do everything I say, because you're only 16 years old. We're gonna start by, picking up the peanuts you spilt. -What are you doing? -Come on, pick it up. What are you doing? -Pick up the peanuts! -Okay. Those peanuts are from Gorman, Texas. Those are the best peanuts in the United States of America. You pick every single one of them up, you dust them off, because I wanna eat them. Yes. Just stop yelling. Why? It's not like there's anyone round to hear me. [tranquil western music] -My daddy… -That's why I married you. -Oh, Richard! -Just kidding. There is a little baby one. Go ahead, grab that one. Well, okay. That wasn't so bad, was it? Why don't you bring me my peanuts? I don't trust you with them no more. Do you understand me? Good. -[car engine revs] -[tires screech] [heavy traffic sounds] What are you looking at? Your wife? No, I ain't looking for my wife. What are you looking for? I'm looking for the three little pigs. Cops are after you? Yeah. Again. [mumbles] All my customers have some thing going on, but I don't ever say nothing. I'll ya. I don't care. Tell me, if you want to. I don't care if you want to-- Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold your wicked tongue. Throw me your cigarette. [heavy traffic sounds] I'll be right in. I'm not a psychiatrist So I can't give you good advice on a bad bet, baby. Hey, sexy. [woman moans] You're Valentino, aren't you? [both moaning] [both mumbling with pleasure] [woman giggles] -I want to see you spin again. -[heavy sensual music] You saw me, why don't you make me spin? -No, I want to see you. -Why don't you make me spin? I want to see you spin. I want to see you again. -See? -I want to see you spin twice. Okay, here it is. You missed it? I just did it. You have to do it up here. Oh… [Richard speaking incoherently] [sensual music continues] Why are the cops after you? Because I killed eight nurses. [chuckles] Were they friends of yours? No, I didn't know them. Well, I knew one of them. How did you kill them? Shoot 'em with a gun? -It does not matter. -Tell me I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to them. Well … I don't remember exactly, but … an uncontrollable impulse … Do you have that urge for me? Not really. You're just a whore. I don't think you are ready for [indistinct]. Listen. [incoherent chatting] The party's over. Oh, whore. Sick. You are sick. -I ain't sick. -You sick motherfucker. Look what you did to my nylons.. Do you see that? Fuck. You wanna see sick, whore? -What do you think of me now? -[woman gasping] [gasping] Do you want to know what a sick person is? [woman coughs] I could kill you right now. Listen to me, all right? [woman] That fucking hurt. That really fucking hurt. [sensual music] [loud thud] You better not pass out before you give me my fucking money either. I ain't no passed out. I don't… -Don't pass out. -I don't pass out. Here's your money. Where's my… where's my… thing? This all I got. I got $28. That's it. You take $28. No tip. Maybe you will get better next time. Guess what? There won't be a fucking next time. See you in hell, you fucking psycho. Yeah, I'll see you in hell, whore. [grunts] [eerie ghostly sounds] [Richard moans like a ghost] [woman cries]] It's all right. [material ripping] I was worried. [women sobbing] All right. I want you to go ahead, and uh… [women] Please no. Begin by tying your feet. Tie up your goddamn feet! [women screaming and sobbing] When done tying those, tie up your hands. [sobbing continues] [dark ominous music] [Richard sighs] [ominous music continues] Oh look, a pretty dinky. Gold chain. [ominous music intensifies] All right. You don't have to tie your feet up, you're coming with me anyway. You will be the first one. It's all right, okay? -Hey, listen to me. -No! [women pleading] Listen. Come on! Come on! Come on! Listen! Listen! Listen. Listen! I ain't gonna do nothing, okay? I just take her to her dorm, get her shit, and then … -[women crying] -… then he left her there. Just gonna leave her there. Money? Get it. It's all right. [women crying] All good. Go. Go. Are you ticklish? [woman yells] I'm kidding. You ain't my type. You are not my type. [woman cries hysterically] I told you, yeah? I'm not going to hurt you. All I'm gonna do, is go through your drawers, take what I want, and then I'm gonna go 'bout my business. All right? Just gonna make something outta my shirt. I'm going to make a little bag. Okay? I'm gonna put all my belongings in it. [sighs] You all right? Start with the top drawer. -[sudden ominous music] -[woman screams] [woman screams in agony] [dark suspenseful music] Why are you doing this? We are just student nurses. -Anet, let it go. -No, I will not let it go! -Stop it! -No! [suspenseful music continues] Student nurses. Guess I just uh… let you all go. Please let us go. Please. I bet you, I finish this next one, before my cigarette burns the table [suspenseful ominous music] Hey! Don't touch! [Anet yells] Be right back. [women cry hysterically] [Anet moans] [telephone dialing sounds] Yes. This is the front desk of the Raleigh hotel. I want to report a man threatening a woman with a gun. Yes, m' am. That's 648 North Dearborn. Room 1001. Thank you. They'll be here shortly. I suggest you get outta here before the cops show up. I think it's a good idea. [feint arguing] Mr. Anderson, are you there? Hello. Chicago Police. Just catching up on some sleep. What's the problem again? -Rough night? -Every night is a rough night. Mr. Anderson, you do know it's illegal to carry a firearm in the state of Illinois without the proper papers? We simply need to get in there to make sure the license is up to date. May we come in? Ah, I mean I don't have a license. Y'all can come on in. I ain't got no license for it. I'm gonna tell you that. [Richard sighs] -Mind giving me the weapon? -Oh. yeah. Right here. Behind the mattress. It's loaded. You don't have the proper paper work for that? No. No, no, sir. I got that just five days ago at a pawn shop around here. Like I said, I work down at the boat docks late at night I got mugged two and a half weeks ago. I just keep it around for protection. Why don't you go ahead and provide us with some identification? Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, sure, of course. There you go. It says here your name is Richard F. Speck. Yeah. You checked in as a Mr. Anderson. Got an explanation for that? Like I said, it ain't safe around here. Okay. Give us a second. What do you wanna do with this guy? [calm guitar music] I'm just going to take the gun. -Are you sure? -Yes. All right. Listen here, Mr. Speck. We understand your safety concerns, and uh… Unfortunately, your piece needs to be properly registered, so we're gonna have to confiscate it, but we're not gonna deal with any formalities, which is a citation, You seem like a hardworking man. We appreciate that. We've just trying to get guns of the streets. Sure. It didn't cost me that much. I don't care. Y'all can keep it. I'm glad I can help you out. Who knows where that gun really came from, I guess. It's from a pawn shop. You have a nice night now, Mr. Speck. Sure. You too. [calm harmonica music] [elevator bell] Thanks for the call, but the guy is harmless. Wait, wait, wait. You're not gonna arrest the guy? No. We questioned him. He's a hard working boat worker. -What? But--\ -It's okay. [traffic sounds] There were a couple of cops here tonight, asking about one of your guests? -Yes. -What room is he in? There's no point, officer. He's long gone. He left about an hour ago. I already cleaned his room. I don't suppose he said where he was going? I didn't even see him leave. All right. Thanks. [traffic sounds] [door slams shut] [phone rings] Sir, I've called at least 25 Speck families, and none of them know a Richard. All right, Dave, but by my account, there were 30 Speck families in the greater Dallas area. That would leave five. You have five more to call. Sir-- -You got five more to call. Go call them. Come on, get out of here! -Dave. -Yeah. [sighs] Did any of the people you spoke with hesitate? They all seemed a little bit bothered that we're calling them so late. That's not what I'm talking about. Did any of them sound like they knew something but didn't wanna say? -There might have been one. -All right. Show me which one. Here. This one. All right. Sit down and pay attention. [telephone dialing sound] Hello. This is Detective Jack Whitaker, Chicago Police Criminal Unit. Yes sir, I understand it's late. I'm sorry. Yes. We have reason to believe you might know Richard F. Speck. I know my assistant called you and gave you the-- -He hung up? -Yeah. Yeah, he did. [phone clanks] [Whitaker chuckles] [ominous music] [woman gasps] I'm just gonna leave you here, okay? All right? [woman shrieks] [woman screaming] All good. -No! -It's all right. Come. Do not bite me. [screaming continues] Everything is fine. [screaming continues] No, no, no, don't! I'm going to leave you here. I'm going to leave you here. [dark ominous music] [woman screams and cries] [Richard] Shh. That's it. Just relax, all right? -It won't take long. -Oh no… No! [screaming in terror] [woman gasping] [Richard sighs with pleasure] [woman sobs] [ominous music diminishes] [footsteps] [coughing] [siren wails faintly] Why would you want to go on do something like that to yourself? -It doesn't matter. -Sure it sure matters. When a man decides the Earth ain't right no more, it matters. I just seen a lot of dying. I figured if I died too, it wouldn't be a big deal. Just didn't think it would take this goddamn long. Nobody said it was gonna be easy. Cutting is easy. It's this dying part that's a son of a bitch. I'm tired. It's what I need, sleep. A nice, long, permanent rest. Tired? I've been running for 40 years. You can't be a day over 25. [grunts] Hell, hobo. Age ain't got nothing to do with it. [speaks incoherently] I've lived a lot of life. I had to keep on moving. You ought to just keep it on moving. You know, you give us hobos a bad name. You ain't no real drifter like me, son. No, you are too mean. We drifters, we ain't mean. But you, you got the Devil inside you, son, the Devil himself. Oh, yeah, he's up in there somewhere, doing a waltz. Don't think you're going to Heaven, son, 'cause you ain't. You're going straight back to where you came. The hell zone. Go to hell, boy. No, on second thought, hell's too good for you. That's true. In fact, my mama squirted me out of her vagina straight into the seven gates itself. Burnt my little tooshie.. [evil chuckle] Good night, hobo. Really? That's really what you think? Yeah, of course. Ernie Banks never said to just play two. It's a myth. No, he did. He did. The very first game of the season in 1964. It is fiction. It's not even true. You're saying that, because you're a White Sox fan. What can you care about the Cubs? It seems that the dead have decided to rise. What, you afraid of the lights? Should've taken a leave. Streets are a lot better without losers like him. All right, pal, here you go. Someone should be along. [hospital announcement] [memory of woman moaning] [coughing and moaning] [eerie moaning] [choking] Wild boars die easier than you. [choking and moaning] [dark sinister music] [desperate moaning] Hold on. [woman screaming] [sinister music continues] [woman choking] [sinister music diminishes] [Richard breathes deeply] [low sinister music] [sighs] [Richard sighs] [sinister music continues] Nurse Boyd, those crazy paramedics have my patient turned around on this gurney. I need you to help me lift, all right? We're gonna do it on three. One, two, lift. Good, good. Swing his legs. Swing his legs around. Here we go. I'm sorry, sir. Here we go. All right, let's swing this gurney around, Nurse Boyd. I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry. It's all right. All right. Well, sir. I'm Doctor Wilkins. Looks like you've had a rough night. -Water. -I have to finish checking you, and we can hydrate it. Is he coherent enough to give me his information? He's coherent enough to ask for water. Sure you can give him your name. Sir, can you state your name, please? I thought I killed you. I killed you. -Nurse Boyd. -Doctor. -What? -Look at this. Would you look at this? I thought I recognized him. It says right here that he has a tattoo on his right arm that says "Born to raise hell". [gasps] My god. Oh, my God. Did you offer those poor girls water? Hm? You sick son of a bitch. I should let you bleed to death, but I'm not gonna do that. It'd be too easy. Suicide. No. We're gonna make sure you live for a long time, in jail. Nurse Boyd, I need you to get me the arm and leg restraints. Yes, sir. [ominous music] Untie me. Someone untie me, please. He said he just wants money. Relax. It will all be over soon, okay? How do you know? He just walked in here and tied us up. You don't do that if you're gonna rob somebody. What's happening to Doris? [evil ominous music] [women sobbing] -All right. -[clears throat] Who is next? Mm? [women sniveling] You? Too much like a dude. [ominous music intensifies] You look rich and spoiled. How nice. Come on. -[women panic] -[soft slapping sounds] -No! -Relax. Let her go. Let her go, damn it! I ain't gonna hurt her. Don't do it again! -Don't touch her! -[woman shrieks] [women crying] [crying and screaming] I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna to hurt you. [women crying] [Richard] I'm really not gonna hurt you. [women crying hysterically] [low sinister music] [eerie vocal music] [tearing sound] -Where are you going? -I'm going to go hide. Don't you dare make it worse for the rest of us. We're gonna sit here and show him that we're not gonna fight. You do that. I'm going to go hide. [sinister music] [sudden ominous music] -[hurried footsteps] -[woman crying] [door rattles] [door rattles] [ominous music continues] [sobbing] [ominous music intensifies] [crying] [woman screams] [Richard grunts] [muffled moans] [ominous music intensifies] [hitting sounds] [ominous music continues] [loud bang] [sudden threatening music] [Richard breathes deeply, sighs] [sinister string music] [sinister music continues] [Richard groans] [music ends abruptly] [dramatic string music] Now Sondra, you sure you can handle this? It doesn't matter whether or not I can handle this. It has to be done. We have fingerprints. What if the fingerprint experts can't identify him? I watched this animal, systematically kill all of my friends, and I did nothing. I hid under a bed, until I knew he was gone. And now I can't live with myself, unless I know I've done something, to put the devil back in hell where he belongs. I understand, Sondra. We just want to make sure you don't get hurt any further. It can't get any worse, Mr. Whitaker. It can't get any worse. Nurse Boyd and I are gonna be with you. Will he be conscious? Yes, he's aware of his surroundings. Good. Because I want to look him right in the eye, and let the devil know there is a warrior on his midst. Where can I go change? [muffled talking] You're going to feel a little pressure when I put this on. I feel the pressure. There ain't pressure. Oh, I got a pressure. I'm going to pee on myself. You don't want to see that. Take a deep breath in for me, Mr. Speck. -Hell no. -Take a deep breath, Mr. Speck. Oh. Go on, give me a bedpan, will you? Bring me a goddamn bedpan, gook! -Go! -Hey, hey, Sondra. -Sondra. -[Sondra crying] It's him! It's him, he's in there! He killed all of them! [Dunning] It's okay, Sondra, It's all right. [Dunning] It's okay. We got him now. He's not gonna hurt anybody no more. Breathe, breathe. You are a bitch! Well, Jack … You got your man. Yeah. I got a word we're just gonna hand him over. We all use a good old-fashioned Chicago hassle with him. [tense music] Nah, we're already at the hospital. [tense music intensifies] [Richard chokes] Help! Nurse! Help me nurse! [choking continues] Fucker! [loud slaps] You're going to be fine, Richard. [coughs] Fucker. [gags] Fucker! [gagging continues] Go on, fight me, you fucker! Fight me fair, you fucker! You come back and fight me fair! You pig, motherfucker! If you want to fight, come and fight! You fight me fair! Come back and fight me fucking fair! You fight me fair! I'll take you! Fight me fucking fair! You fight me fair, you motherfucker! Come back here, and fight me! Fight with me! Fight with me! [uncontrollable fit] [dark suspenseful music] [soft chatter] All rise! The Honorable Judge Petrone is now entering the courtroom. Please be seated. Well, now that we have all filled our stomachs, some more than others, we can continue with the order of the business for the day. Mr. Stevens, I believe the cross and rebuttal are complete? And the previous witness, and that it is your turn, call a new witness if you'd like to do so. I'd like to call to the stand, Miss Sondra Azano. You may, Mr. Stevens. She's waiting in the hallway. I'll go get her. [traffic sounds] [tense harp music] [tense music intensifies] Miss Azano, please raise your right hand and put your left hand on the Bible. You so solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? -Yes, I do. -You may be seated. The witness has been sworn in. Miss Azano, please make sure that you answer all questions clearly so that it can be heard. Please attempt to answer only the questions you have been asked. The court is not interested in your opinion on the matter, Only your answer, as it pertains to what the prosecution or defence attorneys have asked you. -Do you understand? -Yes, I understand. Mr. Stevens, you can proceed with your witness. Thank you, Your Honor. Miss Azano, could you spell your name for the court? My name is spelled, S-O-N-D-R-A, A-Z-A-N-O. [tense music] Thank you, Miss. Azano. First of all, on behalf of the people, I'd like to thank you for participating here today. As you know, a man ison trail, and he's accused, of brutally murdering eight women-- Objection, Your Honor! Mr. Stevens cannot use the word "brutal" in describing… Sustained. Mr. Stevens, there's no need to judiciously add content to the record, thereby tainting the jury. Members of the jury, we are depending on your ability to erase such comments as Mr. Steven's from you mind. I have complete faith and confidence in your ability to analyze the facts. The use of the obvious word shall be stricken from the record. Please make every effort to strike it from you memory. Mr. Stevens, you may continue. Miss Azano, is the man, who faces murder charges, from the State of Illinois, in this courtroom today? Yes, he is in this courtroom. Thank you, Miss. Azano. Would you be so kind, as to please identify him, by describing what he's wearing? Miss Azano? Miss Azano, there's no need to… -Miss. Azano. - -Judge? [defence attorney] You're gonna allow this? [judge] Order in the court! This is the man who killed my friends! Objection, Your Honor! Objection! Obviously Mr. Stevens counts on the witness on gaining the most drama out of the moment! [Mr. Stevens] Your Honor, I did not council anybody. [gavel banging loudly] -[violent arguing] -[gavel banging louder] [tower clock tolls] [faint chatter and whistling] Richard Speck, it's time for your parole hearing. Come on, Speck. Let's go. Stand up and bring your hands forward. You know, they say these uh… supposed to strike anywhere. But they don't work on paper. You can tell the parole board, any family members that came to see me, they can kiss my ass. For the record, Mr. Speck, are you telling me that you're turning down your right to a parole hearing? Hell, yeah. That's what I'm telling you. I ain't gonna have nothing to do with that trails did justice. Shit. No, I'm happy right here, in my home away from home, Unless you want to join me. Mr. Speck, the record has been duly noted. I will tell the parole board of your decision not to participate in today's hearing. Go on and do that. Take them skippy boots on down the hall. I might have to move to Washington DC. They got a hell of a crime rate there. That might be just the time for a guy like me. [door alarm buzzes] [inmates chatting and whistling] [inmates mocking and whistling] [chattering continues] Sorry for the interruption, Richard. I had to take that call. -Say, doc. -Yes, Richard? Mind if I bum one of them cigarettes? It's been a while. [match lights] Let there be light. And there was. Are you afraid of me, doc? No, I'm not afraid of you, Richard. Why should I be? You think I killed all them girls? Yes, I think you killed all those people. I also think you were in a state of heightened anxiety, brought on by a myriad of occurrences just before the event. You had a divorce. You lost yet another job, you moved to another city, etcetera, etcetera. You think if you went through all that, you'd kill someone? No, I don't think so. So what makes you think I would? It's a good question, Richard. I think your brain chemistry has a tendency to be more volatile than the common man. Mm. So you don't think I'm a common man, then? I think you have your moments of commonness. And at those moments, you're pushed over the edge. Did you kill those nurses, Richard? Must have. Everybody think I did. It's a good beginning, Richard. Accepting responsibility for your actions is the first step on the road to recovery. [scoffs softly] No… no, no, no. You got it all wrong, doc. I ain't interested in recovering. I am inhuman. I'm not a … a man … … or a woman. I just do what I please. Richard, do you realize that you are going to be in this jail for the rest of your life? [breathes loudly] Don't make no difference. [tense string music] Hell. If they know how much fun I'm having in here, they'd let me loose. [inmate] Richard, why don't you turn off the camera so we can have fun? We are going to have fun, but I want everyone out there in La La land to see how I run this here cell block. I want everybody out there to know that this, this cell block is mine, you see. I got all the control around here. I run the show around here, okay? This is my bitch, right here, Tyrone. -[chuckles] -You know. I tell you what. I think our cameraman … I think Bobby back there, I think Bobby back there, needs a little line of cocaine. What do you say, Bobby? Do you want some cocaine? Yeah, you wanna take that? Go ahead. -[Bobby sniffs cocaine] -[chuckles menacingly] That's how we do things up here, boy, That's how we do things up here. Better mind your manners, gonna get a spanking. -Ain't that right, Tyrone? -Yes. I'm in the mood for a little spanking. Damn straight. I heard that. I heard that. People don't think chocolate and vanilla mix up in prison. Hell, boy. We got the best chocolate milk you ever had. [chuckles] I melt in your mouth, not in your hands. [chuckles] Now, that's comedy. That's comedy, boy. This kid. Shit. Richie. Why don't you turn off the camera for some fun? No, I want everybody out there to see how I run this here cell block. I want everyone to see that Richard F. Speck has all the control. [closing theme music]
