It's just such an evil, dirty place. It's isolated. It's desolate. It's a rich community. You've got doctors and cops and very, very wealthy people who live there. No one is ever gonna think that that's a bad, dangerous area, but it is. On the south shore of long island, a major police investigation is under way. Ten bodies have been found so far on a single stretch of coast. The chief of detectives calls and says, "they've found another body." And then sometime later, he calls and says, "we've found another body." And then another one. The crimes may be the work of more than one serial killer. They're gonna find more bodies, because a serial killer doesn't stop killing. He keeps killing till he gets caught. The first four victims were young women, found just miles from where a fifth vanished after a terrified call to 911. When me and my mom got that phone call that Megan was missing, I knew that if they found her, it wasn't gonna be a happy outcome. Mother's instinct. As their families search for answers, we ask: Who were these women? Why were four of them hidden side by side on a long island beach? And who is the killer, still out there? Right now, all right, for anyone to come out and say that it's a specific person, a specific occupation, or a specific type, I think, is unfair, and I think it's mere suspicion. It's mere speculation. All right, right now, it could be anybody. On the night of may 1, 2010, a woman who worked as an escort in the online sex trade left Manhattan for a routine job on long island. Her name was Shannan Gilbert. On that night, the client contacted her on craigslist. She called him, made arrangements to meet him at his house. She had her driver, Michael pak, drive her there. He said he was in long island, so we were like, "oh, no, too far." But then he offered two hours for $450. And so since there were not any other appointments, she said, "okay, let's go." Michael pak was Shannan's business partner. They split the profits of the bookings she got online. It took, like, a while to get there. It got darker and darker. I was like, "oh, my god, you know, wow. Where are we going?" They were heading that night to a client named Joseph brewer, who lived in a gated community called oak beach. He drove out in an S.U.V., and then he opened the gate, and then he said follow him. It was very dark, so I could only see his lights. And then he got out of his car, and Shannan got out, and they went in, up to his house. While she was at the client's house, something went wrong. Around 5:00 A.M., he came out. I was shocked, you know? Why is he coming out, right? 'Cause I was, like, sleeping in the car. And then he was, like, you know, "get her out of here." I followed him up into his house. Shannan was standing there right in front of the kitchen. I was like, "Shannan, let's go." When I said, "let's go," he grabbed her from behind, and I think he was trying to push her out, but, you know, instead of just pushing her out, he kind of grabbed her. So she freaked out. And she said, um... Oh, what did she say? Um... "You guys are trying to kill me." That's when the 911 call started. Screaming, "help me, help me, help me." I was in, shaving, at 5:00 in the morning. And somebody knocked on the door and was screaming, "help me, help me." I asked her what the problem was, and she wouldn't answer me. She just kept staring at me, yelling, "help me, help me." At 5:00 A.M., Gus Coletti also called 911. When he told Shannan the police were on their way, she ran. People saw a black truck taunting her as she's running down the street, screaming for help. At that point, she bolted out and ran down the road that way. He took off after her. That was the last I saw of her. Between Joseph brewer's house and the front gate, my daughter disappeared. Shannan Gilbert's 911 call lasted 23 minutes. By the time police arrived 20 minutes later, there was no trace of her. Michael pak was questioned about her disappearance, and so was Joseph brewer. Neither man was arrested or named as a suspect. Her boyfriend, Alex, called me and told me that he hadn't seen Shannan in two days. He wanted to know if I had heard anything or if she was over here with us, and I told him no. Her phone was off, so I figured maybe her phone died. Later on, the next day, her phone was still off, and that's when I got worried, and that's when I made phone calls, you know? I called pak. I called her sister. And, you know, 'cause I didn't know what was going on. You know, I had a very uneasy feeling in my stomach because they always, you know, got into fights, but it was never, like, to the point where he was gonna call me up and say, "hey, have you heard from your sister?" So it was... It was really frightening. She would look in the mirror, and she would cry. She would sing all the time. My nickname for her was diva, 'cause she always tried to act like a diva, you know? Like, she always had the sunglasses on and the makeup and the hair and the clothes and the purses and the shoes. It was fun to watch, but sometimes she was over the top, you know? She wanted to write. She wanted to be a singer. And recently, she had enrolled in college. Along with her college studies, Shannan did her online escort work. She'd started at 21 when she moved to Jersey city. The escort service showed her the glamorous side, all the money and all the things that she could get. It was quick. It was fast. It was, you know, a shortcut. Shannan met her boyfriend at the agency. He was one of the drivers there. I met her doing this, so it was kind of hard for me to tell her to stop. It was, like, a good connection we had, you know? I was never her pimp. I was always... I was... We started off as friends. And, um... And then it led to that, you know? To boyfriend and girlfriend. She did this on her own. She wanted to do this, you know? I never forced her to do nothing. Shannan vanished from the south shore of long island on the 1st of may, 2010. As the summer season began, there was still no sign of her. We tried to file a missing persons report after Shannan was missing for two days. We contacted the long island police department, and they basically dismissed us. They told us that we would have to file it with New Jersey because that's where she was living. And it didn't even make sense to me. We were calling the police, calling the police: "When are you gonna look? When are you gonna search? When are you gonna try to find Shannan? Do something." Immediately after Shannan's disappearance, the police searched the house of the client, Joseph brewer, and, over the summer, checked some land nearby. At the end of the summer, they came back to question the key eyewitness on the night she went missing. We didn't hear another word about it until August, and then in August, a plainclothes detective in the missing persons bureau came to my door, and he wanted to know what she was wearing, what I remember about her. So I told him everything I knew, and I asked him, "why did it take four months for you to get around to looking for her?" That winter of 2010, there was still no trace of Shannan. Then, on December the 11th, a policeman from Suffolk county k-9 unit set out with his dog on a routine training exercise along the isolated ocean parkway near oak beach. While searching the area with a k-9 dog, a cadaver dog, an officer came on the remains of a female. All of a sudden, there was, like, three helicopters going back and forth right over the rooftops, very low and making a racket. I mean, they were shaking the building. I said, "oh, boy. They must have found something." We had detectives come to the house. They told me that they were almost 100% sure it was my sister. And I just remember thinking, "oh, my god, she's dead. I can't believe it." Two days later, police began a forensic search of the area. No one was prepared for what they found. Down now. Everyone's gonna have to go. You're gonna need to go out past the Robert Moses causeway bridge. The entire roadway is gonna shut down. I was in police headquarters, in my office, when I got a call that they had found another body. And it was unbelievable. And then sometime later, the chief of detectives called me and says, "we found another body." And then another one. And I can tell you that that was really a shock. The police found four bodies in all hidden just off the ocean parkway. They were lying about 500 feet apart, wrapped in burlap sacks. The bodies were placed on top of the ground, but they were just dumped over the brush area, which is on the side of the highway. The police do have a terrifying mystery on their hands. We know at least two of the bodies may be that of escorts, but none of the bodies have been officially identified. Everyone assumed when the first body was found that it was Shannan Gilbert. Now there were four, it seemed certain she'd be one of them. Oh, wow. That day, when I heard the bodies were found, like, my... I pretty much, like... My chest, I felt... I just felt... Oh, man, I just can't even... I thought that... I thought they found her. Shannan had one key feature that made her easy to identify. Her boyfriend, Alex, had once hit her so hard, she had a metal plate in her chin. One day, she came, you know, a little aggressively, you know? She got pissed off. She was cursing me out, kind of hit me. And I kind of, like, went out of line, and I hit her. And I didn't think I hit her that hard, but I hit her, and I actually, you know, fractured her jaw. I felt so bad that after that, I never hit her again, ever, ever again, never hit her. It was that plate forensic investigators were searching for. Three days after the discoveries, the police called the family with news. She was ruled out. I can't even describe the emotion that we were feeling. It was like a roller coaster. It was just crazy, crazy situation. I'm glad that none of the bodies were hers, but at the same time, it just... The question remains, you know? Where is she? Three miles from the gated community where Shannan vanished, the forensic investigation continued, and new details were beginning First, how the victims died. The cause of their death was asphyxiation. We surmised that they were killed soon after they disappeared, maybe not immediately but soon thereafter. This was the beginning of a crime that is still unsolved today. The man who had to catch this killer was the police commissioner of Suffolk county. I've seen a lot of violence, murders; You name it. But this was the largest case that I've ever handled. They were all sex workers. They were all dumped in the same place. Cause and manner of death was the same. I don't think it's a coincidence that four bodies ended up in this area. You have these common denominators which are pointing to one person. We're looking at that. We're looking at that, that we could have a serial killer. Long island is quick to the city but yet far enough out where people can have beautiful summer homes, walk on the sand, but it's also very cold and isolated. In December 2010, the quiet suburban streets of long island were at the center of a major unfolding crime. The police announced that a serial killer was at work on the island. Suffolk county is a very safe, peaceful community. But to think that you have a serial killer living and working and playing in your community is disturbing to people. Police are blocking off ocean parkway for yet another day to find new leads in the Shannan Gilbert case and any information on the serial killer... We didn't want to cause an uproar... Yet another disturbing discovery. But it was necessary to get that information out. This has become a very, very large crime scene. And it raised the profile of the case. That's obvious. The police discovered the killer's four victims in undergrowth on the island's south shore. They were lying three miles from a gated community called oak beach. A fifth woman, Shannan Gilbert, had disappeared there seven months earlier. But Shannan was not one of the bodies. The question now was, who were they? When me and my mom got that phone call that Megan was missing, I knew that if they found her, it wasn't gonna be a happy outcome. Mother's instinct. A month after Shannan Gilbert went missing from oak beach, Lorraine Ela's daughter disappeared from a long island hotel 20 miles to the north. Lorraine had been searching for her for six months. Megan was seen leaving the hotel room at 1:30 in the morning by herself, and she vanished. You could meet Megan the first time, and you'd fall right in love with her. She didn't take crap from nobody. She was in and out of jail on little petty things. She drank. And I think she got that one from me. But when she had her daughter, she had actually started straightening her life out. She did everything for her daughter. Her daughter was her life. Her first Christmas, my daughter spent almost $1,000 on her for Christmas. What does a 3 1/2 month old kid know about Christmas? Nothing. Her birthdays, Megan wouldn't mind dumping 500, 600, 700 bucks a whack. She wanted her daughter to have the best of everything. She wanted to save up enough money so she could get an apartment and move out and be able to pay her own rent for a while. I think Megan was into the escort maybe a month or two when I found out. And the person that told me, I didn't believe him. So I logged into craigslist myself. Let me tell you, it's not an easy thing to go through. I think I went through hundreds of ads before I found Megan. Megan posted her escort ad on the website craigslist, because alongside its listings for cars and golf clubs and apartments, there was another service available. How craigslist works is, we would go and get a visa card. Okay, we would put $25 on it. You'd get online. You go to post the ad. So I would have, "italia, new girl in your area." Then the description stating my height and my weight, you know, my services that I provide. And then you post... I posted two pictures. Actually, can you give me a second? If I can get on here... Um, were these pictures right here. The guy calls you, "can you tell me what your services are?" And I would tell him: I dance topless. I go completely nude, and I offer a massage. And, you know, it runs about $175 for an hour, or $125 for the half hour, cash only. And it usually takes me about 45 minutes, if you're in the local area, to get to where you're at. In the old days, prostitutes were in the open, and they were waving down cars and encountering men. If a prostitute was victimized violently by a John, typically, there would be witnesses who could tell us a little bit about what type of automobile she got into. Now with the Internet, it's all gone indoors. It's all gone really underground. We tried talking to Megan about it, telling her that, "it's not safe. You're putting your life in jeopardy when you do this. Why... why are you doing it? You need to stop." Megan's mother was convinced that whatever happened to her daughter on long island had started a year earlier when she was approached in Portland, Maine, by a man from New York. She met Akeem at a club in Portland. I think he stalked her for a while before he actually approached her, to see how she was. And I guess they started talking, and eventually, he told her that he knows how she can make some quick, fast money. So my daughter took him up on it. The night Megan disappeared on long island, she'd been an escort for just five months. Akeem, the man who may or may not have been her pimp, was with her. He was the one that reported her missing. Akeem contacted my mom. He's like, "I went out last night. Megan called me and told me that she was going down to the store, and that when she got back, she'd call me, and she never did." He went to the hotel and knocked on the door. Megan didn't answer. So they opened up the door, and Megan wasn't there. I knew that she was doing more than dancing, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She had also told me that akeem was in the bathroom with her. They had this sign that if she made some kind of noise, he'd come out and protect her. But I found out later on that he always left the room. At 1:30 A.M., Megan left her bag and possessions in the room and walked alone into the parking lot. If she had only stayed in the hotel room, she would be here today. We want to bring to justice this animal that has obviously taken the lives of a number of people. We encourage anyone that has any information to call our hotline. The first insights into the mind of the serial killer were now emerging from the investigation on long island. He'd hidden his four victims in a place which suggested he knew the area. It was perfectly chosen to make a forensic search almost impossible. People don't walk that area. They don't walk their dogs. They don't walk across that area to go to the beach. And so the bodies could lie there without being discovered. We needed to get some resources High-rise buckets that can look down on the terrain. We got cadaver dogs. We got recruits from our police training bureau. And so we commenced a comprehensive search from one end of the beach area to the other. As that search got under way, another family contacted the police. Shannan Gilbert, it turned out, wasn't the only woman missing on long island. She'd disappeared seven months earlier, in may 2010. A month later, Megan waterman vanished from a nearby hotel. Now it emerged a third woman had been missing since September. Her name was Amber Costello. Someone calls me. And they were like, "have you heard from Amber?" And I said, "no, why?" They're like, "because four bodies have been found on Gilgo beach, and they believe, you know, that the girls worked on craigslist." Right then, I knew that one of those girls were gonna be my sister. At the time of her disappearance, Amber was living in a small town just seven miles north of the beach where the bodies were discovered. We had one rule in our Nobody fights alone. And that's just the way it is. So that's how it was with me and her. She was built like a brick house. She was short, but she was very curvy. She was a beautiful girl. She really was. She was a beautiful girl. And... She... she had a smile and a laugh that would just light up a room. It really would. I know everybody says that, but it really... it would make you laugh. She had this retarded laugh that when she started laughing, you would just laugh at her, because it was the most hideous-sounding thing you ever heard, you know? But it made other people laugh, and it was great. How it began was, she had a little job at the waffle house, you know, busting her tail for nothing, and she just wanted more, fast. And I had a friend in college who owned an escort agency. You know, she wanted me to answer phones for her. You know, here I am, hearing these girls talk about making all this money, some of them, $700, $900 an hour, and they're not having sex with these guys, and I'm like, "there's no way." So Tammy was like, "why don't you go on a call with someone? If you think you can do it, we'll set you up." And I went, and it was a bachelor party for a group of golfers at the Beau Rivage, and I started doing it, and I was good at it. I made a lot of money at it. Kim started working as a high-end escort for a licensed agency that took a percentage but screened its clients and had strict safety measures. I had a little travel suitcase, little tinker bell suitcase, and it had my little black light that I would hook up. It had my CD player with my music CD. It was kind of like a show, you know? I had a routine. Amber would see me traveling. She'd see me making all this money. You know, I had a brand-new car. She was like, "screw this." You know, she was like, "I'm coming to work with you." And I'm like, "okay, come on." You know, join the train, you know? Thinking that it would never turn out the way it did. Amber decided to work out of long island and in march 2010, nine months before the bodies were found, moved to a town just north of oak beach. She also decided that in this quiet neighborhood, she'd work in a different way from her sister, cutting out an escort agency and posting her own ads on craigslist. We were coming back from the mall, you know, and Kim said to me, "well, what would you think if we were doing escorts?" I said, "listen." I said, you know, "it's on you." I said, "but I'm not taking any money from you. I'm not answering any phones. I'm not arranging any dates." I said... you know, I said, "I'm not getting caught up in it, and, you know, like... Like I'm a pimp." She's like, "well, I'm gonna post on craigslist, you know. Would you mind posting with me?" I was like, "we'll try it. If you're doing it, I'm doing it." So here we go, taking our pictures. You know, not explicit. I was in jeans and a tank top, girl-next-door type. Her, pretty much the same thing. And we posted. They had their credit card. They went online. And here it is on craigslist, this whole section about escorts. And, you know, all it is is just ads for... you know, for prostitution. You know, so they pay, and they put this ad up. And I mean, they hit "enter" on the computer, and then... And lo and behold, within 20 minutes, it rang off the hook. I mean, I couldn't believe it. I was like, "holy." I said, "I can't even believe that it's this fast." I'm telling you, we probably made $3,000 that first week apiece. From that moment on, you know, it was engines on. You know, ground control to major Tom, you know? It's just... You know? I mean, the phone would ring 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, all the way around the clock. It didn't matter. It just... nonstop. There was one downside to the fast money of Amber's long island operation: The risks were high. In an escort agency, the calls were screened and logged. If you didn't come back from a job, the police would be called in minutes. Here, Amber's only protection was her instincts. You got guys on there that don't want to pay $75. You know what I'm saying? And then you've got girls that will see guys for $75 on there, and I mean, I think that's ridiculous. You know what I'm saying? They'll do anything, and they'll meet up anywhere, and there's no restrictions. There's no rules. By September 2010, another factor was influencing Amber's judgment. She and her roommate were using heroin. At that point, she was taking calls that I would never have took. For Amber, at the end, it was keeping that high going. You know, she had to make that money. I thought, "damn. What did I do?" You know, what did I do? I really, you know, screwed her up, because unfortunately, it's not gonna go a good path for her, you know? It's not about the money anymore. It's about keeping that high going. On September 2nd, Amber went online and posted an ad on craigslist under her usual alias. I had talked to Amber that day. We talked every day. She said that this guy had called. She set up a call for later that night. It was for a couple hundred dollars. You know, he was a... You know, right away, he... You know, he asked her about, you know, like... You know, "how much is it per hour?" You know, and, "well, what if I wanted to keep you for, you know... For the night?" He called her three times that day. You know, she just... The guy kept calling her, you know? And I kept hearing her, you know, like, hamming him up. She gave him directions on how to get to the house. A few minutes after 10:00, he called, and I guess that was him telling her that he's down there. She was getting gussied up. I'm like, "here's the cell phone. Take your cell phone." She just said, "I'm not gonna take it." Everything was just completely different than normal. Normally, she would take this and that, you know, her bag, her... the cell phone. Well, this time, she wasn't. I walked her outside, you know, and she walked down the block. She... you know, and, you know, that's it. So I went back into the house. God. What did she go through? What she must have went through. I know she was probably thinking, "god, I wish Kim was here." You know? Like Megan, Amber left without a bag or her phone. It suggested the man they drove off with, the killer still at large today, does not appear out of the ordinary or alarming. He's a man people feel comfortable with. In December 2010, two families were waiting to hear if their daughter and sister were among the four victims of the long island serial killer. From the time that they came and did my DNA till the day that the detectives were knocking on my door, it was the longest month of my life. Each time, the questions just got more intense: Tattoos, describe to a tee, jewelry, shoes, anything, phone calls, friends, people that they could be in contact with. The condition the bodies were found in meant the only way to identify the victims was by matching DNA extracted from the bones to the DNA of the women waiting for news. My son calls me up, told me that the detectives are on their way to my house. And I don't even think I was home five minutes, and they were knocking on my door. But I have to... I got to give them all credit for the way they did it. 'Cause Megan's DNA actually came back on her birthday. There was two detectives there that told me that my sister had positively been identified... Through DNA. And, uh... You know, I knew. I had prepared myself the whole time. I knew. But of course, the first emotion is, like, you just don't want to hear it. In the early days of the manhunt on long island, the leads came rapidly. Back in 2006, a serial killer had murdered four sex workers on the Jersey shore, and the style of the killings looked similar. They were strangled. And they were dumped in a drainage ditch. So that became a focus. We're in touch with police departments throughout the country, because we're aware that serial killers cross state lines. On long island, police were chasing down other leads, looking at every aspect of the dead and missing women's lives. They seized a laptop from the man with Megan on the night she disappeared. He was the one who called her family to report her missing from the long island hotel. Amber's clients in her craigslist operation were also being scrutinized. And detectives came to talk to the man who witnessed it from the inside. The police came a couple times, you know, and questioned me because it was my cell phone that she was using. I went over all the cell phone records and text messages with them in depth. You know, who was the regulars? If there was anybody whom I thought was, you know, strange. The shock of Amber's death had helped her roommate kick his drug habit and start to get clean. You know, they kept coming, asking me questions. I was only a couple months sober at that point, so everything wasn't 100% back together in my head yet. Shannan Gilbert's disappearance sparked the search that uncovered the bodies. She was still missing, and her boyfriend in Jersey city was convinced the police had been monitoring his phone. Me being her boyfriend, I lived with her. I would say, from the day she went missing, I would say I was probably, yeah, phone tapped. Anybody involved, if they knew her very well, they were probably part of the... Part of the whole circle being tapped and stuff like that. Soon after the bodies were discovered, police returned to oak beach to re-interview Joseph brewer, one of the last people to see Shannan alive. Mr. Brewer voluntarily consented to being interviewed by us. He's been most cooperative, and we appreciate his help in this matter. What about the spotlight that you've been cast in for the media and... I'm not the victim. I don't... you know, I feel bad for them. You know, they're without their children on Christmas, and I hope the best for them. What about your reputation? You know, I'll have to live with that. Brewer was not a suspect. Detectives had also questioned Michael pak, Shannan's driver. I took a polygraph. I passed with flying colors. He grilled me. He was saying things like, you know, "oh, you know, I know it could have been an accident, you know? It's okay, you know, if something happened. And then "...You know," and then something happened by accident." I was like, "yeah, but it didn't happen. You know, the last time I saw her, she was alive, and, you know, she was running." Police said pak was also not a suspect, which left Shannan Gilbert's mother asking, if it isn't them, who is it? She felt sure that oak beach, where her daughter vanished, held the answer. I'm very interested with people in the community. There is where my daughter disappeared. I've paid for a couple of sites that you can acquire information on people. I mean, it's amazing what 10 bucks will buy you. Nothing is sacred, no one is private. It's out there. I took one computer course in college, but it really just taught you the basics. But it's like, the more you find, the more you know that's out there to find, so it's kind of like an addiction. The other families were chasing their own leads, investigating anything that might shed light on the night each woman met her killer. I logged back into craigslist. When somebody logs in to answer an ad, they have an I.P.S. Address that craigslist actually keeps. I started punching in "Gilgo beach," "oak beach," just to see what kind of people were out there, because I want to know, who did she go to meet at 1:30 in the morning the morning that she disappeared? She disappeared? Me and Megan both me and Megan both are afraid of the dark. Megan would not walk across a street by herself if it was dark out. So for her not to take her cell phone or her pocketbook, she had to have known this person that picked her up. Immediately after, I was super detective, you know? I was going back through my books, my records, my phone logs. Anybody that would stand out to me that I thought that maybe I did see him. Maybe I seen him. Then it got to the point where I'm just, like, so intrigued. I want to know, why did he choose Amber over someone else? And how did he do it? Like, you know, what did he lure her with exactly? That killer has taken one very surprising and public risk. From the heart of Manhattan, he made contact with a victim's family. In December 2010, as the hunt for the long island killer continued, one incident became a focus. It happened just after one of his victims went missing. Three women had disappeared in long island in 2010. There was still no trace of Shannan Gilbert. Megan waterman was confirmed among the dead, and so was Amber Costello. The third victim, discovered beside them, was Melissa Barthelemy. She had vanished one year earlier, in 2009, and something about her made the killer take an extraordinary risk. A few days went by, and there were no phone calls from her, and it just wasn't like her. Her boyfriend called me and said, "I haven't heard from Melissa. Have you heard from her?" And I said, "no, I've been trying to contact her." I actually started calling hospitals, jails. I got ahold of an attorney in New York City, and he even did a little investigation, and nobody knew where Melissa Barthelemy was. It was like she vanished. She was so feisty, and she used to do crazy things even when she was real small. She had a pet rabbit. If we had the camera out, she would climb inside the cage so you could take a picture of her in the cage. She was quite silly. After Melissa graduated from high school, she went to beauty school, and, boy, every day, you never knew what color her hair was gonna be. Some days it was platinum blonde. The next day, it would be bright red. Melissa had a younger sister she was very close to. For this interview, Amanda asked us to hide her identity. She was very protective of me, so anything I did, she's like, "no, you can't go there." Or, "no, you're not leaving by yourself." She's just all of a sudden, "oh, I'm gonna move to New York." And I'm like, "don't leave me here." She wanted to go to New York to earn enough money, come home, open a salon, and buy herself a home. I didn't like it. I just don't think she should go to a big city like that alone. They're gonna eat her up there. I just... I had a... Not a bad feeling, but I... I was terrified. My little girl, but she was a grown woman at that point, and I had to let her go. Melissa settled in the Bronx, where rent was cheap, and got a job at a hairdresser. Her sister, Amanda, would come down to visit her, and at first, she seemed out of danger. We went for pedicures, and she'd take me school clothes shopping and go to the movies. Just sister bonding stuff. Then 12 months after she arrived in the city, the news coming home began to change. She stopped working at the hair salon, and she told me that she was working in a topless nightclub. She's like, "mom, don't worry. You know, this is a new era. People do this all the time to put their self through school. It's good money." So... And again, what was I to do? The last time she was here, it was around Christmas, and something was wrong with her. I don't know what it was. She kept cuddling with me and talking to me. And I was trying to get out of her, "Melissa, what's the matter?" And she was like, "nothing. I'm just getting a little sick of New York, but I have to make some more money, and maybe in another year or two, I'll come back." The summer after that last visit home, Melissa disappeared from the Bronx. On July 9, 2009, she left her apartment on Underhill Avenue, deposited $900 in her bank account, and told her boyfriend she might head out to long island. Then she vanished. We knew that Melissa had been in telephone contact with her sister, Amanda. And little bits and pieces began to emerge that the family didn't know about and didn't make very much sense. The police said, "talk to the sister." Well, Lynn questioned Amanda, and Amanda broke down crying, and she said, "mom, Melissa confided in me some things that I'm not supposed to tell you." And Amanda, all of a sudden, presented a fact pattern that was positively frightening. Melissa told her parents she'd started working in a topless bar. She told her sister a little more. The truth was, like Megan in Portland, Maine, Melissa was being recruited. I didn't fully understand then. I think she was just struggling on money, and she was kind of pushed to do it. So she met this really great guy, who told her that, "if you want to make some additional money, you can attend a party." She wasn't, like, clear about everything she would tell me. Sometimes she'd say she was struggling. Now she's told by the same guy, "look, you can make more money if you become a little more active at these parties. And you don't have to do anything with anyone you don't want to do." I kind of overheard things. People posting stuff on craigslist and seeing other people's posts; Kind of put the pieces together. Melissa was actually working with this guy who was setting up dates for her and working off craigslist. She told us he was her boyfriend, but he was her pimp. He actually put her in the hospital three times. She had head trauma. He collapsed her lungs. But we knew none of this, and she hid it all from us. Her family was more fearful than ever and turned to the police to report Melissa missing. I called the 43rd precinct, and I was telling her, "our daughter hasn't answered her phone in three days, and we speak to her daily." And we just knew that something was wrong. She hung up on me. We couldn't even get past the desk sergeant. The lady that answered the phone three days in a row wouldn't even take my daughter's name. The family asked to a local lawyer in buffalo for help. It seemed simple enough, so I got on the phone to compel the NYPD to take a missing persons report. They told me that they don't take missing persons reports for prostitutes unless they've been missing for ten days. Seven days after Melissa's disappearance, when the police were still refusing to take a missing person report, something happened to suggest Melissa was in the hands of the killer and possibly still alive. We were hoping someday she'd call us. And then her little sister got a phone call. I was with my cousin, and we were at her house just watching TV, and all of a sudden, my phone rings. I look at it, and it says "Melissa," so I was like, "thank god." Amanda's like, "wow, oh, my god, it's Melissa." And she answers the phone, and there's a guy on the other end, and she's like, "where is my sister? Who is this?" He was just very calm. He was in control. There was nothing I could do about it. Amanda said that he sounded like he was white, and he sounded like he was middle-aged. She would ask him a question. He would answer back. He knew what he was doing. He did it the way he wanted to. It wasn't until the third call that police were tracing the signal. It was coming from Manhattan. He was speaking to Amanda from one of the most crowded places in the country, where the streets were overlooked by hundreds of surveillance cameras. It was very difficult to track the phone. If you're in a crowded area and you're in Manhattan, everybody knows that there are cameras everywhere. Everybody's got a cell phone stuck to their ear. So which cell phone is it? Each call lasted less than three minutes, and even when the police managed to pinpoint his exact location, the surveillance footage showed only hundreds of people, many with a phone to their ear. He would talk about the things that he's done to Melissa. He was describing acts more of violence than of sex. Every time he called, it sort of got a little more detailed, like he was playing a game with her. The calls went on for a month and a half. There were seven in all. We believe that these calls were made by the killer. It sounds like he was aware of what happened to the victim, so this young lady has had contact over the phone with the killer. Every time my phone would ring and I'd see her name, my heart would stop, and I'd have that sense of possible relief. "Maybe it's her this time." But it wasn't. She was devastated. Every call, she was, like, more panicky. It's all about power, about control. This fits in with the serial killer mentality. The final call was, uh, he actually said what he did to her. He actually told Amanda that he killed her sister. "You should have seen her face. Gonna watch her body rot. Then maybe I'll come tell you personally." In my mind, I feel that he held her for at least a month. You know, I still don't sleep at night. I never, ever, ever turn off my phone. I paid Melissa's cell phone for over a year, just hoping that one more call would come in. The killer who made those calls is still out there. Who he is and why he's killing remains a mystery. Okay, I guess everybody is set. We're all ready. And good morning, everybody. This is obviously a major investigation. And we in the Suffolk county police department have allocated major resources to the case. Now, I want to assure everybody that we're on top of this investigation. In the first months of 2011, Suffolk county police had four bodies and no suspect. Then, as now, the pressure and speculation was mounting. Who is this killer? Criminal profilers agree he knows the local area, has a job, and is probably married. He's selecting victims who look like the girl next door. It's a neighbor. It's a father, maybe. You know, it's... Who knows? It could be the frickin' mailman. Who knows? You don't know. The phone calls from Manhattan give other clues. He's brazen and cunning and takes pleasure in terrorizing a teenager from a crowded street. That blows my mind. To torment and torture a 15-year-old girl, what kind of man are you? He's also meticulous enough to leave police with next to nothing. They don't have anything to work with. They don't have a murder scene. They don't have a witness. They don't have DNA. They don't have a crime scene. What they have is a bag of bones and hope. A prolific killer who might seem perfectly ordinary to his neighbors and family is something suburban long island has seen before. When police noticed a pickup truck with no license plates, they gave chase. When the truck stopped, they became suspicious and found the partially decomposed body of a woman in the back of Joel Rifkin's truck. In the mid-'90s two local men, apparently coincidentally, started killing women. A postal worker named Robert shulman killed five prostitutes. Joel Rifkin killed 17. At the time, he was a landscape gardener living at home with his elderly mother. Basically, his operation consisted of picking up the women, having sex with them, killing them, and disposing of them. From his prison cell, Rifkin gave police hunting the new killer the benefit of his advice: He will be a local who works with burlap, probably a fisherman, a landscaper, or a contractor. Dave Schaller, Amber's roommate in Babylon, had seen for himself the scale of the secret online sex trade in these quiet suburban streets. This is the neighborhood, you know? There ain't nothing different here than anywhere else, you know? It hides well, you know? That's the best way to put it, you know, to hide in plain sight. This is where it happens, you know? Everybody thinks it's in the inner cities and stuff like that, but in reality, you know, there's probably more going on... just as much going on in suburbia than there is anywhere else. The executives and the people, you know, who run these companies or, you know, the dockworker, the guy who's a construction worker, that's the clientele. And you know what? This is where they live. There's a lot of no-good going on behind closed doors, especially in these areas. You know, they're the most overlooked thing, you know? Everybody overlooks suburbia. Most of my people were business working men, you know? Corporate America... That are just freaks and like to be freaks. They can be what they fantasize about on those calls. I knew this was dangerous, you know? There was one guy who was stalking her. He would call and tell her, you know, "I'm looking through the front window of your house, you know, and I see you standing there." There was this other guy who was a realtor guy. He wouldn't hurt her, but he would, like, put his foot on her chest and, like, flex his arms and. You know, just, like, very strange things to make himself very... seem very powerful, you know? Police believe this killer, like other serial killers before him, is a regular client who doesn't kill every sex worker he sees. After he murdered her sister, Kim overstreet posted an ad online to try and lure him to a meeting. Honest to god, I was on a mission at that point. I was going to know, okay? That was it. And when I seen them, I would know. I also thought, "well, maybe he'll just try and do it to me." And I was ready. I know that it's gonna take this guy slipping up and making a mistake in order to be caught. And he will. Eventually, somebody will get away. If they prepare themself mentally at this point, from this point on, read a couple books on it so that you know what you're coming across and you can recognize the signs of it. Okay, that's what I did. And you've got to be able to fight, because if you can't fight, you're not gonna get away. This killer is part of a growing trend in Internet crime. He is selecting his victims online, using the cover of a fast and anonymous sex trade. When a sex worker puts an ad on craigslist, within minutes, they get many, many hits. It could run into the hundreds. Normal, run-of-the-mill murders, there's a relationship between the killer and the victim. These are stranger-stranger contacts. He's not the first killer to use craigslist to hunt his victims. In 2009, a medical student attacked three women he'd met on the website, killing one of them. Because the Internet offers anonymity, you know, in these chat rooms, craigslist, and the like, I think people generally tend to feel safe on them, until they agree to actually come in contact with one another. The killer began selecting his targets online in 2007, and the first woman he killed had characteristics that linked them all. I've always looked for my sister, 'cause I hold on to hope that maybe one day your sister will come walk through the door and, you know, say, "hey, I'm okay." You know, "hey, guys." The killer's most recent victims are believed to be Amber and Megan, who disappeared after Shannan in 2010. Melissa he killed in 2009. But his first victim was back in 2007, and her name was Maureen brainard-Barnes. Her story confirms a pattern that links them all. Maureen didn't really play too much football. She was more girly girl. I was the more tomboy. My brother was a football star his whole life. I always played with the boys, and they couldn't catch me; I was fast. We used to stack up grocery carts on top of each other, and we'd sit there and just look at the stars and tell each other everything about ourselves. We were like best friends. We were, you know, lifetime best friends, even though, you know, we were brother and sisters. The most highly prized commodity in an online sex industry worth about $3 billion a year is ordinary American girls like Maureen, the girl next door. Maureen was beautiful, but I don't think that she really convinced herself that she was. Someone contacted her on MySpace, and they said that they wanted her to come down and do modeling, and Maureen was like, "oh, great. This is awesome." That offer was from New York. It seemed tempting and apparently harmless, but it put Maureen on the radar of an online industry hunting fresh new faces. I think that she saw it as, you know, "I could provide and be this big person." And as soon as she got to New York, it probably was a different thing than what she thought it was gonna be. Kind of got some hints that maybe she was doing something else. I did confront her a little bit about it, and she was like, "no, I'm just doing modeling." And, you know, it would upset her, so I kind of backed away. From the moment Maureen posted her first online ad, she was in the killer's domain, and he made his selection. On the 6th of July, 2007, she traveled from Connecticut to New York and checked into the super 8 hotel on 46th street near Times Square. The online sex trade delivered her to his door. When she didn't come home that Monday, I was calling her voice mail. Then a few days later, I called my brother, and he was like, "well, let me see. She'll answer my phone." And he called, and he was like, "now it's going straight to voice mail." Maureen's brother and sister immediately began to search for her themselves. They found the reaction they encountered hard to bear. After Maureen went missing, my brother and my husband jumped on their bikes, and they went to Manhattan to go ask people, you know, "have you seen my sister? You know, do you know her?" They said, "it's a different world out there. No one cares. Everybody's too busy to stop and actually talk to you and want to help. Nobody's seen her. No one knows her." Back home in Connecticut, they turned to the police to report her missing. The police officer was like, you know, "maybe she ran away. Maybe she doesn't care." I don't know if he was trying to make us feel better or what, but it made it seem like he didn't care at all. And, like, my brother was so upset, he had to walk out the door. I grabbed the missing persons papers. We returned them that week. Took them 2 1/2 years to put her in the database. The irony is that Maureen had actually stopped working as an escort when she disappeared. She was living back in Connecticut with her two young children and was looking for a job she could fit around child care. She would come to my house, go through the papers. She applied from, you know, stop-and-shop jobs and dunkin' donuts jobs. It wasn't like Maureen didn't look. She looked. Then in July 2007, she got an eviction order. The week before the court hearing, Maureen went back on craigslist and arranged to meet the client in Manhattan. The last signal on her cell phone came from long island, just miles from oak beach. All right, three. Now we're gonna move down the beach a little bit, see if we can find more. On march 29, 2011, three months after the first victims were found, the story of this killer took an unexpected turn. Two miles to the east of his first victims, police found a head, hands, and forearm. They were the remains of a woman named Jessica Taylor. We know that miss Taylor had lived and worked as a prostitute in Washington, D.C., but had fled from there to New York City, where she remained for a few days prior to her disappearance. Taylor was identified from a tattoo on her back. This, again, was another change. To be honest with you, I wasn't surprised. I mean, I was thinking four. You know, there may be more out there. What made this twist more disturbing was that the rest of Jessica Taylor's body was found eight years earlier in a long island town 40 miles away, and that discovery was just the beginning. At the end of march 2011, police discovered a fifth body on the same stretch of beach as the first four victims, this time, a dismembered woman who'd been killed years earlier. In early April, a further search began. Once again, no one was prepared for what they found. It's all been very startling. All of it has been. I really... I don't have a reaction for you because it's just amazing that we're finding these things. So obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We initially found four, and then we found six more. Total of ten. In early April 2011, days after the discovery of the fifth body, the police found more human remains in the same area: Two women who'd been dismembered, an Asian man who'd been beaten to death, an infant child about 18 months old, and two unidentified remains to the south. This was a twist in the story. This was something that we weren't expecting. I mean, we were expecting, you know, sex workers, prostitutes, and so this was an equation that really threw us for a loop at first. We were trying to figure out what was going on here. They'd found more, and it started all over again. I was just like, "oh, my god." Like, a baby. How could the police find all these bodies in the same area all of a sudden? There are so many whys. Each time they found somebody else, it was like the cops just came and banged on my door. It's like it brings everything right back to the beginning. It was hell. It was devastating. Long island woke up to the news that an almost unbelievable crime was unfolding on its south shore. On the isolated oceanfront beside beaches packed with tourists in summer, police had first found four bodies, and now they'd found six more. There was different theories out there, even within law enforcement. The way the bodies were disposed of was a little different. Is it more than one killer? The latest find raised the possibility that more than one killer might be at work and that it might be as many as four. It's a tough area. It's very easy to miss something. And if there are any more bodies out there, we want to find them. This is the biggest incident in my career and in the career of many of the officers that are working this case. And it got bigger. It's now larger than life. What we do know for certain and what is now very clear is that the area in and around Gilgo beach has been used to discard human remains for some period of time. The discovery of one body led to nine more, and this strip of oceanfront road was uncovered as a dumping ground for multiple killers. It had all started with the search for one woman who disappeared from oak beach, a 23-year-old escort named Shannan Gilbert. It was just my fear that she was just lying there somewhere, and she was just there, and nobody even wanted to go look for her. Shannan's family had waited again for news that she was among the bodies. And again, the police called them to say she'd been ruled out. A year on, her mother was more convinced than ever that the answer to her daughter's disappearance lay in the long island community. These are the books that Shannan had. It's filled with names, addresses, and phone numbers of clients. And slowly but surely, my friends and I were going through every name and every number. The majority of clients in here are very wealthy, well-to-do. In fact, one of our... One of my last conversations with my daughter when she came to visit, she says, "mommy." She says, "I'm okay. You wouldn't believe the clients I have. These are doctors. They're lawyers. They're judges. They're teachers. The money is incredible." She said, "I'm going to school. When I get my degree, mom, I promise, I'm gonna stop." I thought that since she's so smart, if anything was bad or not a safe situation or a safe place, that she would leave. And she tried to that night. On the night of may 1, 2010, Shannan met up with her driver, Michael pak, in Manhattan. After Shannan's success on craigslist, they'd both quit the escort agency they worked for and gone freelance together. We're like, "all right, forget this, you know? We can just do it ourselves." So... yeah, so we did. You know, cut out the middleman. That night, pak says Shannan posted her ad not on craigslist but on a rival site called backpage. She was booked by a client named Joseph brewer who lived in the gated community of oak beach. Shannan had been in his house for about two hours when brewer called Michael pak into the house. She freaked out. She said, "you guys are trying to kill me." She went behind the couch, crouched down, and then I... So I went there, and I looked at her, and I said, you know, "Shannan, what are you doing?" You know, and then I was trying to think, you know, "is she really messed up on drugs or..." So I tried to test her by asking her, "have you seen the movie fear and loathing in Las Vegas?" She said, "yes." So I thought, "oh, okay. So she is coherent, then. She's just acting." And then, you know, I heard, like, a 911 operator, a lady on her phone. And that's when I realized, "oh, she's on the phone with 911." So I thought, "oh, she's trying to set me up." She's saying, you know, "you guys are trying to kill me." She wants me to leave, so I left. The driver was back in his car when he says he saw Shannan running from the house and started to follow her. I turned the lights on and everything, and I drove slowly, and I said, "Shannan, where are you, Shannan?" You know, 'cause there were, like, high... high bushes. You could see a car coming, and it was stopping and going, stopping and going. I ran down off the deck, and I met him over there, and I stopped his car. He said he's gonna call the cops, and I said, "no, you don't have to do that." At that point, she bolted out and ran down the road that way. He took off after her. That was the last I saw of her. I couldn't find her. I called her name, and then I called her on the phone. And I said, "Shannan, where are you?" I couldn't find her. That's it. That was the last time Shannan was seen alive. Police questioned Joseph brewer and Michael pak, but neither is a suspect in her disappearance. Okay, everybody, we're ready to start. And good afternoon. We're hoping that by having this press conference and getting the message out to the public that somebody will recognize somebody, and that will be a break in the case. By September 2011, the DNA was coming back on the new, unidentified victims: Three women who'd been dismembered, an Asian man beaten to death, and a child. They were thought at first to be the separate victims of separate killers, but strange new links were now emerging. This is a mystery with a lot of twists and turns. Like the fifth victim, the body parts of one of the women had been found over a decade earlier in another long island town. She and the child, about 18 months old, were wearing matching jewelry. The toddler now was connected. It appears to be the mom. We know that sex workers sometimes take their toddlers with them. As crazy as it sounds, it happens. The other twist was, the the Asian male was wearing women's clothes. Very small stature, slim. Again, the theory is that this person may have been working in the sex business. It also emerged that another unidentified victim was linked with a grisly discovery 15 years earlier on nearby fire island. One of our retired detectives called the homicide squad and said, "you should look at the legs that were found in 1996." And the DNA matched up. The police were now working on the theory that every one of the victims discovered was connected to the sex trade, and that led them to a very frightening conclusion. When ten bodies were discovered on long island last winter, it seemed possible that police had accidentally stumbled on the dumping ground of several different killers. This winter, police are pursuing a new theory. Serial killers evolve. They change in how they do things. We believe it's one person, one killer. They think he started killing 15 years ago. But in 2007, he refined his methods and went online. Maureen brainard-Barnes was the first victim connected to craigslist, and the others followed in 2009 and 2010. They're gonna find more bodies, because a serial killer doesn't stop killing. He keeps killing till he gets caught. The one person police believe is not connected is Shannan. There doesn't seem to be any connection. Everything is different. It is some coincidence that she went missing in the same area where the bodies were dumped. But when you look at it closely and you look at the evidence, Shannan Gilbert is a separate case. So the woman whose disappearance started it all is still missing. It appears that whatever else happened to Shannan that night, she did not encounter the serial killer who murdered the other four women, which leaves her mother, like the other families, searching for answers. Me and the other victims' families, we're one big family now, not by blood. We were brought as a family by tragedy. We're just trying to help each other right now. Let everybody get through it until they find this guy. And I just hope they find him in our lifetime, that it don't take more deaths. I mean, for all we know, he could have picked two or three girls up this summer and be doing the same thing to them. My name is Mari Gilbert. My daughter is Shannan. She is out there. We're gonna find her, and we're gonna find out who hurt Shannan and all the others. Thank you. In the parking lot beside oak beach, the five families gathered for a press conference to keep the search for Shannan in the public eye. In the last year, they have grown increasingly critical of the police investigation. When we call Suffolk's police department, the only thing they tell us is, "like we told you before, we ain't gonna tell you nothing." Well, you guys need to realize something. Not only was our daughters victims; Their families were also victims. For you to sit there and tell us that, "we can't tell you nothing," that makes us think that you're putting this off to the side... My daughter was Melissa Barthelemy. Because of the profession that these girls had. I don't blame them for being upset. They want a conclusion. They want this person caught. But the occupation of the victim has no bearing on the investigation. We have a murderer out there. The five families have also become an online network sharing what they've learnt about the sex trade their daughters and sisters were drawn into. They're all angry at craigslist. Five women have now been killed after advertising as escorts on its pages. They thought it was a safe way to advertise, and I really think that craigslist should have more people monitoring these sites, and they need to be held accountable. Craigslist has twice shut down its adult content pages and tightened its regulations. But even in the new "casual encounters" section, there is not much doubt about the nature of some of the ads. Lorraine Ela is determined to warn others about the way ordinary American girls get recruited for the sex trade. They target certain people. And my daughter, being softhearted, friendly, outgoing, that's what these men look for. He goes after the weak ones. And my daughter was one of them. Melissa Cann recently found an ad her sister Maureen posted on a website called sexy jobs. She believes this was the start of the road that led Maureen to escorting. You know how they always say weed is the gateway drug to cocaine or heroin. This is considered the gateway drug of the sex industry. They post theirselves up on there for, like, phone sex jobs or stripping or, you know, modeling, nude modeling. So it's legit. But this is how some girls get found by, you know, escort agencies. Her brother, will, never stopped searching for Maureen. He died in a motorcycle accident two years after she disappeared. The other mothers have become Melissa's surrogate family. I'm very, very fortunate to ever have met them, ever to know them. Shannan's mother is still out there looking. The mystery of her daughter's disappearance is still unsolved. I don't believe that I'll find her alive. But it's okay, because she's still always gonna be with me every day. And no matter how long it takes and no matter how many times I need to come here, I'm gonna bring her home. As for the killer, police have received over 1,200 tips suggesting his identity. One given to the Barthelemy family's lawyer was from a woman who believed it was her former husband. One tip stands out. It talks about a man who is involved in the technical world. He's got an elaborate basement. He has an ex-wife who described him as being mysteriously absent during the periods of times that these girls were abducted. And I'm hopeful that it will lead to an arrest and a conviction and a life sentence. That information has been passed on to the police. For now, the investigation cannot rule out the possibility that they will find more bodies or that the killer will kill again. Any time there's a serial killer loose, that's a concern. We believe that killer made a mistake at some point. We have to find that mistake. I would also like to say to the women in the sex business to be careful in their contacts. Let me give the advice to you that was given to me that I never took heed of: When you go too fast and you get to the top, there's nowhere to go but down, one way or the other. When you're making that money and you're hustling these guys and, you know, you're thinking that you're living on top of the world, you just need to stop and think, "well, what's after the top?" We just went through life carefree. If any damage was gonna be done, it was gonna be from us, and it doesn't work like that. It just doesn't. Not for me, not for her. Not for you. I'm not ever gonna say, "no, I won't work." From time to time, I always put ads up just to see what bites, as far as my sister's killer goes. It'll intrigue him. And that's what I'm hoping I do,
