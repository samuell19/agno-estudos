October 30th 1941. Hell has broken loose. Suddenly we were under attack, and there was nothing but chaos around us. Only a handful of comrades are left. And they are just as inexperienced as me. Now we stray around in the Ukrainian mountains, isolated from our troops. In our search of help there's nothing but severe cold... ...and endless silence. Be quiet... and you'll stay alive. Who's in the house? Everybody is in the church, except me. - You speak German? - Of course. Who's in charge in this village? Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth... Don't move! And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen... - Don't move! - Don't move! - Do you all speak German? - Yes... If you cooperate with us, we won't harm you. - Maxim, come here... - Nadja! My men will accompany you and collect your weapons from your houses. - Hurry up! Now! - Move it! Faster, please! Where is your pastor? - He died years ago. - There's no replacement. The parochial house has been empty for years. Who leads the service then? We don't need a leader to pray. This rifle belonged to my husband. It's the only one. There you go. Your chairman wasn't quite popular, right? My good education prevents me from talking about this person. Lord have mercy upon him. My sister and me run this farm alone. Mother is dead, and they deported our father years ago. He was deported? By whom? Well, men from the Communist Party. First they took our harvest, then our men. And what happened to them? You don't have to be scared. Someone up there is protecting us. From the 2nd cavalry regiment in 1813. It belonged to my great-grandfather. Thanks, but you can keep the wall decoration, Sir. Hey, I get the feeling you're growing a belly... Funny.. - So? - It's okay. You're a brave man, Private Döbelin. - Hey. Don't... - Okay, okay. I'm coming. So? We only saw women, old folks and kids. Most of the people are happy to see us. They're all Russian-Germans. They've been living around here for over 200 years. Well, who knows. Lots of things can happen within two centuries. Nonsense. Stalin took everything they had and murdered hundreds of thousands of farmers. Either way, we can't trust anybody here. All right, we will take quarters here. - Your kids will stay with us. - Excuse me? You heard what he said! Get into the house. Move. Come on, boy. Get in there. - You should have stopped them! - How? You should have done something! Don't you dare start crying now! Stop acting like a complete idiot. Men are not different from the cattle in the stable. How do you think you can make the soldiers do what you want them to do? If necessary, you offer the Nazis your pussy on a silver plate. Be calm! Here, take a sip. It's good vodka. I need a clean towel. Have you heard of this one. The cannibal says to his sweetheart. "May I give you a hand?" and she says. "Thank you, but... ...I already had breakfast!" - Don't move. - Does everyone here speak German so well? German was the official language here until the revolution. On the other hand our Russian is awful. Tell me... do you have experience in something like this? Only with cattle. But don't worry. Pigs or humans, there is no big difference. This is where we got attacked. Then we got dispersed to the East, so now we should be around here. Far behind in enemy's territory. Damn Ivan is blocking our way back. So what do we do now? The river forces us to make a detour. At least 150 to 200 km. By foot. In the cold. You're nearly there. Hold your horses. - Change of guard. - Finally. So... did I miss anything? Yes. Hitler was here and brought some new underpants for you. Yeah. Thanks, Willy. I thank you both. Please come back tomorrow and have a check up on him. Well, Döbelin, your first medal looks to become the Badge of the... Wounded... Anna, we've got to do something. We're obligated to resistance. Resistance? If we show loyalty to the right ones now, they'll see we are on their side... Please! Stay calm for once in your life! At least for my child. Hocus-pocus... Abracadabra... Yeah, and if it shows the head I'll punch yours. Private Kracht, you better keep that promise for the enemy. What are you looking for, Lieutenant? - My Badge of the Wounded... - Maybe... ...this one? No jokes about this! Understood? OK, and the others. Take the children next door! Yes, sir! Well, shame on you. What do you have to touch his holy talisman for? What? The Lieutenant has snatched from the jaws of death four times. Right. This medal has symbolic meaning to him. What symbolic meaning? A symbol that his guardian angels are looking after him. Yeah, it's true! That thing has always protected him. Mum... We need to find a way to inform the Red Army. Are you crazy? If the German soldiers find out, they will set fire to our village! But if the Russians find out, they will do the same! Marta, the Red Army believes we're saboteurs! They want to take us away like cattle! No, they won't take us away! When they find out that we did not turn against the Nazis... ...than they will shoot us right here! But maybe this will be German territory in a few weeks, At least the Germans are more respectable than your Russian comrades. Katja is right, Marta. If we turn to the Red Army now and Hitler wins the war... ...than we're fucked. Oh, in the end you just support the one who wins? No! We support the ones who lets us live! That's our old tractor. It hasn't been used for years. - Scrap at its finest. - You think we're gonna get this going? - It falls apart just by looking at it... - Lieutenant? - When you get back to your troops... - Yes? ...please, tell them, there are Germans here, waiting for rescue. Promise. Even if we get this thing going. How could this small tractor be useful? There you go... - A carriage? - A hay cart? - With wheels in the snow? - Well, I don't know... We'll put skids beneath it, of course. A Christmas sleigh, loaded with us all. Come on boys! Let's go to work! I'm leaving for the district capital! What? It's the only chance we've got. Okay. I'll help you. We need your help. You've got skilled hands. Did your husband teach you? My husband? No, my father did. My brother works for Krupp as a steel worker. He taught me a few things about metal work. I've got five siblings. Three brothers and two sisters. And I do miss them lots. What about you? Did your husband give you any children? No, not to me... My heart is yours, but my cock belongs to them all, you gotta share it with the others. - That's exactly what I said to her. - And she agreed on that? Of course! She wouldn't want to miss out on the top dog like me! Well, I'm happy with my darling Ruth. - When I'm back I will marry her. - Really? I always feel awkward talking to girls. I don't know what to say. Compliments always work. It's OK to have a little fun, but... ...I would advise against marriage. But aren't you married? Yes... After winning the Gau Championship the fourth time, we went for the national title. "We, the """Red Pants""", won 12 matches in a row." Damn rats... Gerda? - I myself scored nine times. - Yes? Get some bait ready for the rats! Okay. What happened next? Well, on the day we crushed Bremen 5.0, guess what... - What happened? - I got my conscription call. Oh, no! Goodbye football shirt, hello military uniform. I belong to the football ground, not to the battlefield. I wouldn't bet on that. I saw you playing in Hamburg and, well... Somehow you're unlike the other women here. Well, I'm not from here. Mom, look! I said: Don't touch 'em! Show me your fingers! Thank you for helping us. Yeah, whatever... You can't wait to get rid of us? It's OK. You don't have to be afraid. When we come back... ...we'll fly the German flag together. If you try to call for help, I'll tell the soldiers about your plan. Un... tie me! Anna! For God's sake! I'm sorry. Just have some booze. That's disinfection from inside. If it doesn't get better you recall the woman and... Yes, Sir. - Here, take a shot. Thanks... - Nastrovje... What about you? Any resolutions? Well. Just being happy. Finding the right man... Starting a family. - And what about you? - Me? Well... Surviving the war somehow. No worries, it will be fine. We'll come back to protect you. Yes! I told you it will work! Yes! Yeah! Good job, boys. - That's how to make it! - Well... It looks like we've got to stay one more night. But I think your kids should spend the nights with you from now on. Have a nice evening! Heil Hitler. Auntie Marta is very sick and therefore she sleeps in the chamber. Okay... Whatever happens. You must not open the door! Oh sweetheart, I was so worried about you! Don't worry, mom. We're protected. I arranged that! Yeah? You did? You're such a good boy! I hope you'll suffocate from it! Good night... A good night kiss? - What's the magic word? - Akracadaber simsalabim. Stop! Who's there? Lieutenant. We've got visitors. Ladies... What's up? Since you will leave us tomorrow early... we thought... So you will remember us in a good way! Check this out! It looks like Stalin when we're done with him. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! "Do I have to spend the night alone?" You'll leave tomorrow and there'll be lots of cold and lonely nights ahead of you. That's right. But unfortunately I've to stand guard soon. I'm really sorry. How much time do we have left? What would you do if I came with you? What would I be allowed to do with you? This? What about this? I think we better should leave it at that. Cheers! Oh Germany, I have to march, oh Germany, you boost my courage. Oh Germany, I have to march, oh Germany, you boost my courage. I want to wield my saber, my bullet shall sound, it's meant for the enemy's blood! I want to wield my saber, my bullet shall sound, it's meant for the enemy's blood! Goodbye now, farewell my love, don't cry your eyes red. Goodbye now, farewell my love, don't cry your eyes red. Carry this grief with patience, my body and live I owe to God at first. Change of guards, Nössel. You can go party now. Thanks, but I really need a snatch of sleep. You can sleep when you're dead. C'mon amuse yourself a little. Hey, I'm not keen on catching syphilis, idiot. ...mother, take my goodbye kiss. To fight for the fatherland, is my duty second after God, so I have to leave you. To fight for the fatherland, is my duty second after God, so I have to leave you. There's also a sound arisen mightily through my heart and mind. There's also a sound arisen mightily through my heart and mind. Justice and freedom is the third duty and it forces me away from you to face death and battles. Justice and freedom is the third duty and it forces me away from you to face death and battles. That's what an Aryan is supposed to look like. Blond like Hitler, tall like Goebbels and slender like Goering! - Do you think we'll be home at Christmas? - Well, I will be! - I'm not so sure about you guys... - I'll definitely be home by then! "They need their heroes like me. I'll say "Hi" to your wife's then!" Mine is not even gonna open the door for someone like you! Yeah, but most likely "they" will screw it up again. And Goebbels will tell us "Christmas tales!" They should just let us do our job, and stop talking big time, while sitting in the warm and drinking Cognac! Right, those are the ones who shit their pants at first enemy contact! Yeah, and we've to clean their mess up afterwards! Nah, our "Miss Leier" does the cleaning! Our army command would certainly be delighted to hear you talking! You'd get a medal for farting the national anthem if that'd be expected! No, that one already belongs to Kracht! What belongs to me? Nössel wants to blame us at the army command! Best you go to Hitler directly! Yeah, you will certainly be granted an audience! - Hey, hey boys... - Don't you touch me! Do you have a screw loose? Are you out of your mind? You will immediately apologise to that lady! On behalf of my comrade I'd like to apologise to you. Oh, no, it's OK. Cheers. Auntie Marta? Maxim? Can you help me to open the door? But mom said you're ill and I'm not allowed to. Oh no... I feel much better. Maxim... I... I need to pee really badly. Maxim, you will open this door now! Or do you want me to... Miss? What else? If I went too far earlier on, then... Then I'm sorry. I didn't want to offend you. No, I'm sorry. I behaved awfully. You will come back, will you? - Good night. - Good night. - Good evening. What are you doing there? - Oh, good evening... I just... collected some old stuff. A few blankets, some petrol lamps. Thank you very much! You quickly made that old thing work again. Yeah, the boys have unexpected talents... Sleep well. Good night! Lieutenant... Well, I don't know... My father smoked just like you... Thank you. That's very kind of you. Well, if Stalin smokes them.. What... He's got bad fever. Take him to the other room! What? Damn it! Just get a new bandage! It's gonna be fine. No, I don't want that! Grimm... Do you prefer to die? - By the way, where's the lieutenant? - Oh, I'm sure he's just having a dump. - For two hours, huh? - Big dog, big dump. And what's he supposed to be doing here anyway? He couldn't even remember our names in the first couple of weeks... ...the holy lieutenant! - Nobody asked you, Schulz! - What? Shut your jap, little chap! I guess you need some whipping! Your lieutenant won't come to your rescue... Shut the fuck up! - That's enough! Come here! - Hey! Calm down! Marta? What have you done? Me? No! He's your comrade... But... I'm not a doctor! Neither am I. This pig wanted to kill me! So the only options were. Him... ...or me! Anna, for God's Sake. That guy killed Katja! Tomorrow morning these murderers will be gone. Until then we only have one choice. No damn word to nobody! Ready? So? Is he gonna make it? Hundreds of kilometers? In that cold? Even on a carriage... Yeah but... then we have to somehow... wait... till he's recovered. It's the lieutenant's decision. Has he shown up yet? Nope. I think, he's with one of the scarlet women... But... he is married... Well, that happens to married men as well... Especially to them... All right. Split up, talk to the wenches. Hey! Don't act like a big shot! You were right. You were right with everything! Helga, I'm so sorry, but we mustn't lose our minds now! - You want to let them get away with that? - Vera is right. Shut up! For God's sake, shut up! All of you! What? You blame us? I'm sure none of them thinks... that we've got anything to do with... - You fucking two-faced pigs! - Hey, Nössel! Nössel! Come on, we've to find our lieutenant. Fritze, what's wrong? What are you whining for? I don't really know! What a mess. This girl was almost still half a kid! I believe no one of us is capable of doing anything like this... I believe all of us are capable of doing this! Guys! We split up! No false move! Put it down! Mum, what do those men want? Our lieutenant has been killed. What do you know about it? What? I want to know who has killed our lieutenant! No idea! I don't know anything about it! Well, I believe you know something... Well, I don't know anything about it. Who's done it? I'm sure it was one of you, who killed my sister! I don't' know what you're talking about! I'm glad your lieutenant is dead. And I hope you'll all fucking die, one after the other! Come on, spit it out now! - Stop it! Helga! - No... - Now you stopped laughing!?! - Helga! Stop it! - You want more?! You dirty slut! - Stop it! - Want some more?! - Fritz! Calm down! Stop it! Helga! - Do something! Make him stop! - Stay out of this! You'll be next! - Stop it! - Talk to me now! Tell me! Do you wanna die like her? - You're really innocent, are you? - I swear! But who else could've done it? Any ideas? - Who did it? - No! - Fritz, stop it. - Do something! Make him stop! - Talk! Tell me now! - Stop! You stop it right now! Alright! There's no need to scream and yell at me! Maybe she really doesn't know anything... Come on, tell us! Lt was the miller called Ursula Wagner, right? Yes, yes! Lt was her, Ursula! Marta, please! Guys, we know who did it! What do you want? Don't you move! What have you done? - Let me go, bastards... - Let her go! Shut up! You should be happy we let you and the kid live! Let me go! Lt wasn't me! - Hey! - She killed the Lieutenant Wenzel! - How do you know this?! - We've got a witness! And we found this at her place. - Hold it. We're nearly done... - We've got to get Ursula out of there! But, how?! Marta, we all don't know how to fight! They've got their guilty one... Right? You want to leave Ursula with them? Do you help me? Probably Ursula is already dead... Sh... shit! Please, let me go! I didn't do anything to anyone! How do we get away from here now? Please... Oh, God... Why us? We didn't do anything wrong! If Ursula killed the officer... ...she has to stand up for it! Gerda, shut up and take your stuff! Don't move! You've got to come with us immediately! What now? Oh, God! No... No... It's not as bad as it looks... No... Please, don't! Why's nobody helping me?! No! Please! Please! - We came as friends... - Please! The murderer just gets the punishment she deserves! Oh, God! Please! Please! This can't be true! Come on, Schulz! Oh my god... Forget it! This isn't really happening, is it?! Coward! Lt was your idea... ...so do it yourself. Please! Why don't you believe me?! Please! Help! Please, help me! Oh, my God... Please! Oh, no... No! Do you think Leier's got more courage? Please, please! Somebody has to do the job. You can do whatever you want, but don't kill me! Please! Please, don't kill me! No! Full cover! No... Watch out! No! We attack in the flank... Stop! Hold on! Put down your weapon! I surrender. Why are you staring like this? She was just a dirty coward of a partisan. Help! Let me come down! Please don't kill me! Why doesn't anybody help me?! Oh God, leave me alive! Calm down, Moos. Everything's gonna be okay... - Don't... - I haven't done anything wrong! - Don't try to fool me... - Please don't kill me! Please! Oh, God! Help me! Please! Let me go! Let me come down! Don't kill me! - I want to live! Please don't kill me! - Now... ...now shut the fuck up!!! I'll be back... You've let him die! Bullshit! How do you dare talk to me like that?! Are you nuts? What are you still doing here?! Didn't you want to start fighting like a hero against the Red Army, and then end in croaking? You all are just dirty, ugly savages! You live under hammer and sickle and give birth to your children on the field. You are a shame for your ancestors! You are no Germans at all! And you follow Hitler! You burn books written by Freud, Brecht and Heinrich Heine! You are no Germans at all! Stop it! Put down the weapon! What have you done?! It's gonna be okay, Nössel. We all leave together... ...and we will tell everything to the colonel. But you can't make any more mistakes! You fucking asshole! Grab your stuff and then let's get out of here. What about Jochen? - We've got to leave him here. - What? He will die out there immediately! Come on, we've got to leave! I knew that it would end badly. - Who just watches should shut up. - You've just watched, too! Yes. But that's over now. I'm so sorry about your comrade. We've done everything possible for him... We didn't want all this. I know. Try to come back soon. Lt would make me happy. Do you want to take the stew with you? I guess you've got a long journey ahead of you. Enjoy the meal. Wait a moment! Hold on! What about you? You can't be serious!? Oh, it really tastes fantastic! Stop, wait another moment! Holy shit! Auntie Gerda? Auntie Gerda? Hey... - It's the gun of your sister. - Yes. Full cover! I got one! "Do you've any ammunition?" Not much more... We'll fight until our last bullet, you bloody defeatist! Shut the fuck up, Nössel! Damned shit! Let's think about how we'll get out of here! Don't think, there's only one way. - We've got to fight! - Oh really?! Or we could just leave and say it's over... Yeah, let's enjoy a nice summer in Siberia... That would be great! Lt might be even warmer there than here... Almost tropical! Fucking cowards! If you surrender I'll shoot you in your back! It's not funny! Stop fucking laughing! I told you to stop! Willy! - Come! Come on! - Leave me here... - Shut up, or I'll shoot you! - Full cover! At the crossing to the right, there'll be the settlement! Just to the right over there, and then we'll see the village! Rudi? - You've got to promise me one thing. - Whatever you want... The world should know... ...what crimes we've done here... I promise. - We stop over there at the church! - Sit still, don't move, or I'll shoot you! The Russians... Come on, dear... Come with me, dear, we've got to leave! No, don't! The Russians arrive! I don't want them to harm you! What are you doing?! Come, sweetie, I just don't want you to... Come down! Wheel into line! Check the huts. Bring here every living soul. Why are you crying? Where's your mother? She belongs to me. Come with me, Nadja... We only found those kids, there's no adult alive Come to me, Maxim! We move on! Take off! I'm sorry. I don't know anything about it. I wasn't there when it happened.
