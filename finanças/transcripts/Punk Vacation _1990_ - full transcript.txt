(electronic music) (light music) (birds chirping) (train bells ringing) (church bells tolling) (river burbling) (gun shots bang) - [Dispatcher On Radio] Base calling Officer Reed. Come in, Officer Reed. 10-4. Sheriff wants to see you, Officer Reed, come on in. - [Sheriff On Radio] Dammit, Reed! Pick up the radio! I know you're out there, boy. You're shootin' things with that shotgun. Dadgomit, I know you're out there, shootin' some of those damn old beer cans. You there, you there, Reed?? Come on, buddy. Over! For Christ's sakes, over! Over! Over 10-4 over! Reed, you there? Over! Over! - Yeah, I'm here. (upbeat pop music) - [Dispatcher On Radio] Officer Reed, Kemper's alarm's going off again. Want you to head back out of town and go check it out, 10-4. - This is Reed. On my way. (police sirens) (soft country western music) - It just went off. We didn't do nothing to it, honest. - We can't keep riding out here every time your alarm goes off. Get it fixed, or disconnect it. Get it? Look, I got better things to do than chase after false alarms. Getting off soon? - What of it? - Look, can't we just talk for a little while? - What do we have to talk about, Steve? - Hi there, Deputy Reed. - Hello, Sally, what's shakin'? - Same ol', same ol'. Nothing ever happens around here. What are you up to? - Trying to get your mean sister over here to talk to me. Come on, Lisa, I was only kidding. Let me take you home. I'm driving right that way. - I'd rather walk over burning coals. - [Mr. Kemper] She ain't going nowhere with you. She's coming to our house for supper. - Don't tell me what to do, Dad. I'm gonna talk to Steve. Sally, keep my dinner warm. Come on. - Ever since she joined that Chamber of Commerce. (engine revs) - Nothing ever changes here. - [Mr. Kemper] You can say that again, Ed. (engine hums) - Hey, why's your dad so down on me? - I guess he doesn't think that you're gonna amount to much. - What do you think? - Money-wise, or love-wise? - I bet they're back in love already. They make a nice couple, don't you think, Pop? Steve's a good guy. I know Lisa really likes him. She just won't admit it. - What does money have to do with love? - I don't know, let me see your bank book. We'll talk about it. - Real funny. - (laughs) Ha ha ha. (laughs) (motorcycle engine roaring) (Billy sniffles) - There's no orange! There's no orange! Shit, I hate cola. (sighs) Shit. Geez, give me my cola. Give me my cola now! Come on! Shit! I want my money back. Come on! Damn, come on! Give me my money back! - Um, Dad, there's some weird guy out there beating up the cola machine. Dad, don't go out there. - Shit, come on! Damn! (blows landing) Yeah! Give me my money back! - Whatcha doin', boy? - This machine stole my money. - Get on your cycle and get. - No, I want my 40 cents back. - Get! - No, oh, this is great. First, there's no orange drink, then I lose the only money I have in the whole world, and now some old desert rat's got a shotgun pointed in my face. Great. This is a great day, great. Super. Gonna lose the only money I have in the whole world. And now some old desert rat's pointing a shotgun at me. This is great. - Get. (engine fires up) (ominous music) Sally, get in the car. (Sally sighs) (alarm sounding) - Damn, I forgot to turn the alarm off. (engines revving) (Sally screams) (crickets chirping) - Steve, I'm sorry about the money crack. - Ain't no problem. It's true anyway. (Sally screaming) (alarm sounding) - See you tomorrow. (light music) - [Louise On Radio] Hey, Steve. Kemper's alarm is going off again. - That old man's running me ragged with that damn alarm. Okay, Louise, I'm going over. (ominous music) (alarm sounding) (Sally gasping) (gun cocks) (laughing) - You can put that gun down. Nice and easy-like. (laughing) (Sally gasping) - Shouldn't have set that alarm off, old man. (laughing) (engine humming) (Sally screaming) (laughing) - [Sally] (screaming) Oh, Dad! No! (dark music) (Sally screams) (crying) Dad! (blows landing) (punks yelling) (Sally screaming) (engine humming) (motorcycle engines revving) (brakes scream) (Sally crying) (somber music) - [Dispatcher On Radio] Ambulance, assist. 14th and 27th Street. (mumbling) - Looks like you screwed up again, Reed. - Huh? - You took your time coming out here, huh? - You alright? Took a pretty good knock on the head. Must've been about 10 to 12 of 'em. - Sally? Sally? - Hey, we're gonna take my car. - [Steve] I'll call Lisa. - Louise, this is 465. Louise, this is 465. (engine revs) Louise, this is 465. This is 465. (somber music) - Steve, what's with the bump on the head? You have a rough night tonight? What's going on? - I don't know. - Look, the kid that you hit, did he have anything to do with the Kemper murders. - I don't know. - But you're gonna tell me. Look, I heard it was something to do with a cult. Does it have anything to do with drugs? Come on, Steve, you owe me one, huh? - I don't owe you anything. - Please, will you leave? - Steve, thanks a lot. (camera shutter snapping) Hold it right there. That's it, that's it. (camera shutter snapping) That's it. Hold it, hold it right there! That's it, hold it for me. (foreboding music) (radio chatter) - [Woman] Is this the guy that killed Old Man Kemper? - [Man] Yeah. - [Woman] Where they taking him? - [Man] They're gonna take him up to security level. - [Nurse Over Radio] Page, Dr. Davis, telephone, please. (electronic beeping) (somber music) - What happened out there? - Excuse me? - I said, what happened out there? I'll tell you what happened out there. One of the finest citizens this town has ever known had his ass murdered out there by them filthy, yellow-bellied, fascist communist pinkos! Communist-- - Look, I told you that-- - Sit down and shut up. You know, Reed. (phone rings) You wanna do a man's job, you wanna do it right. You look the enemy straight in the eye, before you get knocked unconscious. - Duane here. State troopers have ID'ed no motorcycles on any highways going out of town nowhere. - Well, where in the hell are those Commie bastards? - Well, I don't know, Virg. - Well, if they haven't left the area, maybe they're still around here. - Duane, who we got up there in the hospital watching guard? - We get my nephew Carl. He moonlights for us sometimes-- - No, no, no. That idiot, he forgot the stop sign when he was doing the school crossings, for crying out loud! We gotta get someone that's-- - Well who else are we gonna get? Everybody's out chasing that gang. - Why don't we call in the state troopers? There's a lot of canyons out here where these guys can hang out and just disappear. - No, no, not state troopers. Did Patton call in the state troopers when he took Iwo Jima! - No, that was MacArthur. - Well then, Patton called MacArthur when he took Iwo Jima! (patriotic marching song) (engine humming) (bluesy harmonica music) - Haven't you learned to play that thing yet? - It helps me think. - What are you thinking about? - I ain't seen nobody die before. - Well, my friend. That is the way of the white man. - (sighs) Why do I even talk to you for? (bluesy harmonica music) - White man come in iron horse. - What do we do now, Coach? - I say we go tell Ramrod. (engine idling) - Yeah, Reed, this is real good. This is better than the last place you took me. Yeah, there's punks hoppin' all over this place. - Why don't you shut up? I just had an idea that these guys might be-- - Nah, you had a vision, a real vision. - Yeah, what do my little Indians have to report? - Pale face travel across desert in iron horse. - Pigs, they're headed back to town. - We oughta split. - I told you, we ain't leavin' 'til we get Billy. (indistinct chatter) - There's nothing we can do for Billy now. - We can try, can't we? - Look, I don't know about you, but I came along to get away from the smog. I didn't sign up for the Dirty Dozen, you know. I thought maybe we could do a little fishing, go out on some nature walks, stuff like that. But, no, you kill the old man, and now I feel like Jesse James. - You know, Feggy, vacations have a way of turning out different than you plan. - Shirley, we just didn't just lose some traveler's checks, you know? We offed the old geezer! - I think he looked like Governor Pile's grandfather. - You can leave any ol' time you want. Just remember it was Billy who rescued you from Konoko Park. (wind blowing) (dark music) Everybody in? - Yeah. - Robespierre? - Oui. - Good. Now that's settled. Now all we need is a plan. Any questions? - Can I go play some more Indians? (jingling) - Would we still be here if it was not Billy? - We'd still be here if it was Feggy. - But we might all be in the chair. - Listen. Doesn't a shepherd leave a flock of a hundred sheep, just to find one little lamb? Well, I guess you can call me the gang shepherd. - I think you're good shepherd. - Thanks. Anyway, somebody had to convince Coach that women are as good administrators as men. - Yeah, look at Eva Peron. * Don't cry for me Argentina * Do-do-do-do (indistinct chatter) (cart clacking) - Hey, Tom. - What? - Owe me $20, will ya? - Are you kidding? You still haven't paid me the 10 bucks from Christmas. (ominous music) (echoing screaming and laughing) - [Billy Voiceover] You put that gun down, nice and easy-like. - [Ramrod Voiceover] Set that alarm off, old man. (echoing screaming and laughing) (foreboding music) - Don't even ask what happened to me. - Oh. - You okay, ma'am? - I don't know, I just felt kinda funny. - Can I get ya something? - Yeah. Something to drink? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. (ominous music) (heart beating) - Excuse me, nurse. You think we can get this little girl patched up? - Sure can! - My knee's a little scraped. Kids are used to that stuff. (ominous music) - What are you, from social services or something? Come on, nurse! Get out! (screaming) Hey, nurse! Nurse! Get away from me lady! Get out of here! (buzzer sounding) Hey nurse! Nurse! - Kill you! - Get off of me! - What the hell? - This crazy lady here's trying to kill me! - I better let Duane know about this. - You gonna tell him you deserted your post while guarding a dangerous prisoner? - What the hell's going on? - That was a real stupid thing to do. - Well, I had to do something. - Do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life? Let me take care of the punks. - Not without me. - What? - I said, I'm in on this. - No you're not. - Yes, I am. Or I'll just do it on my own. (buzzer sounding) - Yeah. Yeah, Sheriff, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Lisa's here. She just got back from the funeral. Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah, okay. Yeah, bye. How you doin', babe? - I'm alright. Have you heard anything else yet? - Yeah. Everything and nothing. Had a lot of calls, all crank. (phone rings) Yeah? Riley? Don't you have anything better to do than make up... You're serious now? Yeah. Where? The Richardson ranch. Yeah. (foreboding music) How do you know it was them? How many of them were there? Look, yeah, yeah. Look, man. Everybody's seeing punks out there now. Okay. We'll get some people out there tomorrow. Look, man. We don't have anybody left here, okay? We've had so many damn calls, there's no one left. I said tomorrow! (ominous music) - Why do we have to do this look out duty? (laughs) - Oh. - Well, like they ran out of crank, you know? - This gang stuff is really nowhere. Maybe we should go to stewardess school or something. - (laughs) No. Not me, man. You know, electronics training. That's where it's at. - (scoffs) No way! - Yes, way, Flo! The computer revolution took off, without enough people trained to repair computers. - (laughs) You're gonna settle down and get a regular day gig, huh? - Maybe I am. Or maybe I'm going back to the band. - Coral Aggression? That band is really nowhere. - You're just jealous. - Like, I'm sure. (dramatic music) - (scoffs) Oh. It's your turn to watch, you know. - Okay, girls. Come on. Come on, get up. I said move it. - It was your turn to watch, you know. - Oh, how was I to know when Django was gonna pop up? - Well tell that to Ramrod. - Let's go. (vengeful music) You're gonna be joining your friend in jail real soon. - [Ramrod] Honey, you ain't got the guts. (gun cocks) - Just try me, sweetheart. Okay, everybody, take it easy. (gun shot bangs) Come on, let's go. - There's 10 of us. You might get one or two. But we'll get you in the end. You wanna play chicken with me, Hoppa? - Well, they better elect a new leader first, 'cause this one's got your name-- (Lisa yelps) - Let's assimilate her into the group like the Indians used to do. - We'll think of something. - She was here for a minute. I got a phone call from Riley about the punks, and she disappeared. - What do you mean, disappeared? - She was sitting right there. And then she disappeared. - [Steve] What do you mean disappeared? - She was sitting right there, and the next thing I knew, she was gone. (phone rings) We'd be doing a lot better if you grab hold of one of these phones. (dark, ominous music) (outlaw music) - Shit. Is that Ramrod? Wow, it doesn't even look like her, does it? - Hey, don't forget the food. - I'll get it first. What do we want? - Blimpies. - No way! We had subs in Mojave yesterday. Maybe we could get some-- - Why can't we just live off the land? - I'm not grubbing for berries, Feggy. Let's get chicken. - So is it the Colonel then? Hands? Uh-huh. Majority rules. So does everybody want slaw and potato salad? - Carrot salad. (motorcycle engine revs) - [Nurse Over Intercom] Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair, Dr. Jane Emilton, Dr. Jane Emilton. (electronic beeping) (whistling) (electronic beeping) (foreboding music) - Billy! Come on, get up! I'm gonna get you out of this dump. - Mom? - Come on! Help me. - Ramrod! What are you doing here? - This frame has got to come apart somewhere. - [Nurse Over Intercom] Dr. Davis, telephone. Paging Dr. Davis. Telephone please. - Shh! - You look like mom! (laughs) (metal clattering) Ramrod, my arm! - Shh! (Billy grunting) (metal clattering) - Let go of my arm. - Shh! Oh, God, Billy! (Billy moaning painfully) Billy, help! - Ow, God, Ramrod, my. (grunts) - Let's go! - What? Come on. - Come on! Billy! - What are you doing? - I'm getting you out of here! - There's the guards! Go, go, go! - No! (Billy yelling) Ow! - She tried to stab him yesterday. I didn't tell you because-- - What are you talking about? - Lisa. She tried to stab him. - That wasn't Lisa, you dummy. You know, sometimes I don't really think you're cut out for this kinda work, Carl. - Well, I feel motel management. - Well, maybe you oughta try horticulture. - En garde, monsieur Special Ed. - Ha! (laughing) God, I love it when you speak French, Chuck. - My name is Robespierre, you American swine! (laughing) (Flo yelps) - Oh, God. - Drink? - Thanks. - Hey, you know, you guys don't seem as warped as everyone else around here. - You know, your nostrils flare when you get excited. (grunts) - Oh, we're not. We're just misguided as hell. (laughing) - Whatever you say, Chuck. What's your problem, Flo? - Well, me, I've always really been into group identification, you know what I mean? - Yeah, I do know what you mean. One of my best girlfriends joined the Scientologists. - Did you ever hear from her? - Just this note saying, "Sell the car, "sell the house, sell the kids. (girls laughing) "Religious freedom or die." (laughing) - Um, you know, you're not so bad. Oh, you want some? - Thanks. Listen, my boyfriend's a cop. If you two help me get out of here, I'll ask him to go easy on you. - Oh, he's a cop, huh? He ever handcuff you or anything? (girls laugh) - Yeah, once. It was fun. (girls laughing) (dark music) (engine humming) - What are you doing here? - Get dressed. - I'm entertaining right now. - [Steve] Those punks have Lisa. - What made you think that? - Don, I'm not kidding. - Okay. (sighs) Okay. I'm sure she's okay. (techno music) (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (dog growling) - Stay. Stay, dammit, stay. (clattering) (glass shattering) Ready? - Why not? (sighs) - Hold it. I forgot something. (footsteps fading) (techno music) (glass shattering) (dog growling) Shut up. Ready? - Why not? (brakes squealing) I think I missed it. - It is not that way. It's telling you it's this way! Go, take a right. - [Don] Get your hand off the steering wheel, please. - [Steve] Let me drive, will ya? - [Don] No! You're not driving. I'm driving! - [Steve] I'm telling ya, you're going the wrong way. - [Don] It's this way! - [Steve] Go take a right! Take a right. - [Don] I'm driving. - [Steve] I don't care who's driving. Get out. Get out of the Jeep. - [Don] I'm driving, it's this way. - [Steve] I'm telling you, you're going the wrong way. I know these mountains, I've been out here before. (indistinct arguing) Let me drive, just let me drive. - [Don] I'm not letting you drive! It's this way! - You're going the wrong way. (techno music) (screaming) (thunder rumbling) (loud screaming and techno music) Here's the plan. You sneak down and grab 'em from behind, while I create a diversionary landslide. - That's the plan? - Yeah. Why, what's wrong with it? - It sucks. - Huh? - I've seen a million movies. And when the white guy makes the plan, the black dude always does the dirty work. - I don't think this is the time to discuss racial stereotypes in the media. - Man, she's your main squeeze. You sneak down there and grab him from behind. - [Don Voiceover] You're really gonna use that cucumber, huh? (loud techno music) (rustling) - Why didn't we think about this earlier? (gun shot bangs) Great. - Looks to me these are women. When we go in, you shoot anything that moves. Except Lisa. Freeze! (gun shot bangs) (Ramrod screams) Get outta here! Move it! - Forget you, pig, you and that whole redneck town. - Jeers. - Well, I guess we can't expect you back for Labor Day weekend, can we? (crickets chirping) (fire roaring) (ominous music) - You're kinda cute for a parasite of humanity. Maybe we'll just rape you before we cut your throat. Anybody interested? Hands? Well, that settles it. We rape you, then we kill you. (terrifying music) (gun shot bangs) Let's get him! (anxious chase music) (Lisa yelps) (Lisa moaning) (gun shot bangs) (Lisa screams) (gun shot bangs) (dramatic chase music) - Don, I'll cover. You carry Lisa. - No, I can make it on my own. - Don't be a jerk. (dramatic music) (gun shot bangs) - Alright, get him. (motorcycle engine revs) (gun shot bangs) (Coach screams) (Coach gasping) (engine revving) - Better stay at my place tonight. They might know where you live. - What a line. Does that work often? - I don't know what to say. - Me either. I really liked Coach. Everybody did. Well, she's a lot of help. - Europeans. Just don't have a work ethic like we do. (thudding) (wind blowing) (thunder rumbling) (wolf howling) (outlaw music) - We are gathered here to pay tribute to our comrades, who fought bravely against the parasites of the military industrial complex. If we owe these brave warriors one thing, it is to spring Billy and trash that town, especially that deputy and his girl. - That electronics training is looking better and better. - Encino even looks good now. - You ladies still part of this funeral? - Yeah, sure. - [Ramrod] What about you, Miss Henderson? - Definitely. (thunder rumbling) (somber funereal music) (fire crackling) (owl hooting) - Kill the pigs! Kill the pigs! - [Punks] Kill the pigs! Kill the pigs! (loud techno music and screaming) (gun shot bangs) - How in the hell did you manage to kill two of those Pinko punk Commies at four o'clock in the morning? Where is everybody? Won't you go round up the gun club? Tell 'em we're going quail huntin'. - I'm supposed to take the punk in the hospital to the lock-up in Sanford. - Alright, I'll do it myself. Skeeter! We know where they are! Yeah, start getting the boys together! I know it's early in the morning, five in the morning, but come on! Get up and get over here! We're gonna help cure them Commies of their iron-poor blood. Bullets, Skeeter. I mean we're gonna plug those turkeys with bullets! Daggammit, Skeeter. I know bullets are made of lead not iron. But that doesn't make any difference! Shut up! Now get over here! Idiot. - They'll be moving Billy down this road into town. Now, I've checked all around this area, and we can see in any direction we want, unless somebody comes through the woods here. I've given a lot of thought, and we only need seven people on the road, so I want two of you to head directly back to LA and warn the club. Maria, the straws. Now, Venny, because of your special command of military strategy. - Yeah, I did take ROTC. - Right. I'm putting you in charge of our western defenses. You take Sinbad, and lay traps out there, just in case those cops get any weird ideas. - Why Sinbad? I've been in the club longer. - He was in special forces in Nam when you were a Boy Scout. - Eagle. - Anyway, I got another job for you and the girls. - It's not our turn to get breakfast. - I want you girls to take Feggy into town and steal a car. We need something to block the road. - Not me. - You got a problem? - I won't be a part of senseless violence or car theft. - I don't want no trouble. I just wanna get Billy. - Look, didn't we learn anything from the 60's? (blow landing) (Feggy coughing) - Now get moving. And don't get one of those economy jobs. We need something big enough to block the whole road. - I don't know who died and made her Fuhrer. - Shh! You wanna get socked by Feggy? Oh, oh, you're not taking those disgusting vermin? - They go where I go. Besides, they don't smell any worse than Venny. - You guys help Sinbad build perimeter traps. I'm gonna scout the next ridge and check out the barn. - Right, boss. What do you need? (motorcycle engines hum) (phone rings) (RC car whirs) - Yes? Hang on a second. It's for you. - Hold on. Yeah? (sighs) When did they cite him? Did Don go out there yet? Geez! They got a posse out there already? Everybody? Why didn't anybody call me? I should go out there too. Oh, yeah, that's right. I'm not at home. Am I? Um. We'll be right out there. (sighs) Come on, let's go. (panting) - What do you got there? - [Carl] It looks like some cupcakes, sir. - We got confirmation of punk activity around here. I don't know if they're still here, but we're gonna take a look. Now any of you guys got any kind of police or military training? - Yeah, right here. Used to be a security guard at the hospital. - Aren't you Officer Duane's nephew? - Right. - The one who failed his electronics exam? - Well, I got my associate's degree. (laughing) - You take half the group and go to that ridge right up there, see? - Yeah, I got it. - Okay, and I'm gonna take the other group and go to that ridge right up there. - Okay. - Alright. - Any other questions? - Yeah, I was in Nam. How come I can't take some of the boys and go up there on the ridge? - You seen combat? - The show? - Goddamn CB's, come on! Let's move out! (patriotic music) (moves into exciting dramatic music) (grunts) (crow caws) (patriotic music) - [Virgil] You take half the group and go up to that ridge right there, and I'll take the other half and go over there, alright? - [Nam Veteran] I was in Nam. How come I can't take some of the boys and go up there on the ridge? (ominous music) - Where are those girls with that car? - The sheriff and some rednecks are coming this way. - Well, you gotta hold 'em off. (Venny scoffs) - Let's go this way, Charlie. (frog croaking) (crow cawing) (birds whistling) (patriotic music) - I don't see no damn quail. (whistling) (foreboding music) - What the hell is going on here? (men grunting) Damn! get out of this! Damn, get out of this! (frog croaking) (mud squishing) - Let's go this way, Charlie. (men grunting) - Hey, look out! Hey, whoa! (men yelling) - Whoa! (dramatic ominous music) (moves into exciting chase music) (gun shot bangs) (men cheering) - (screaming) Shot twice in one vacation, what a drag! (gun shot bangs) (grunting painfully) - Hey, you ain't get a quail? - Goddamn! Get down! (gun shot bangs) (exciting chase music) - We're under attack (speaking in foreign language). - You guard our rear like the gates of Paris, Robespierre. (Robespierre humming) (creepy, ominous music) (engine idling) A Volkswagen? - It was Shirley's idea. - You girls get up on that rock with Maria. You signal as soon as you see that cop car come around that last curve, and then you're responsible for getting the bikes ready for the escape. Where's Feggy? (exciting rock music) (gun shot bangs) (exciting rock music) (drumming) (ominous music) (gun shot bangs) (exciting chase music) (motorcycle engine revs) (exciting music) Get out of the car! - Alright, alright. I warned ya! (laughs) (laughing) It's my people! You see, I told ya! I told ya I would! Yeah, that's my sisters! You see, I told you! I told you but you wouldn't listen. I was doubting you'd even miss me, but here you are. Here you are, and I love you! (laughing) (distant shouting) It's my people! You see, I told ya, I told you I would! (laughing) (screaming) (gun shot bangs) - Ramrod! (gun shot bangs) - Get back! Get outta here! Get back! Get back! (gun shot bangs) (dramatic music) (screaming) Get back, get back! Go on, get back! (Ramrod screams) - No Ramrod! (screaming) (incoherent screaming) (Ramrod whining, screaming) Get back! (crying) (Maria shushing) Stop it! Get out! (crying) (dramatic music) (moves into somber music) (motorcycle engines revving) - Let's go! Ramrod! (gun shot bangs) Ramrod! (dramatic rock music) (motorcycle engines humming) (uptempo rock music) (engines roaring) (uptempo rock music) (funky music)
