[dramatic clinking music] [cheering] [thudding] - [Tommy] I know you have it in you. Bring it out. Bring it out. Bring it out. [tense music] - [Danny] You've got the item? - As promised. You'll never be able to [mumbling]. [mellow music] â™ª Ooh - [Tommy] It wasn't that long ago when it all went down. Sure, the bullets, the blood and the bodies have all been cleaned up by now, but, psychologically, the damage had already been done. That's where I come in. It all started with Jackson Bolt. I did my best to clean up that brother's head, but... God, I tried, I really did. [mellow music] - Jackson. What? Jackson. - You're not listening to me. - Wait. Jackson. Jackson, listen to me. - [Jackson] 'Cause he's always over there. - This is what I'm talking about. You never listen. - Darla, we do this every time. Hold on a minute. - Where are you? - [Gunman] Don't come any closer, man. I don't wanna fucking shoot you. - [Jackson] You're not gonna shoot me. Your safety's on. [thudding] [grunting] You know something? [gunshot blasting] [screaming] - Is that gunfire I can hear? - [Jackson] He better not be wearing my robe. - You know, you know what? Forget it. - [Jackson] I don't have time for this shit. - Kinda like this. [gunshots blasting] [crashing] [gunshots blasting] [coughing] [gunshot blasting] [thudding] - Can't believe you killed 'em all. - Pow. - This is it, right? - Yep. - Everything? [sighing heavily] - Yeah. - Get out. - [Jackson] Seems like I was in Tommy's office every other week, right after another blood bath. But I didn't care. We kept him busy and it kept the streets clean. Let's take a minute to meet a couple of shall we say, service providers. They go by the name of Sky Malone and Diamond Doll. They were always trying to get away from their lowlife pimp, Jimmy. [weeping] - [Diamond] What happened? - I almost threw myself in front of a bus, but I keep seeing Naomi's face. - Listen to me. We're gonna get through this. I have a plan. I've been hiding money in the trunk of my car, under the spare tire. Got exactly 2,500. All I need is 15. [tense music] [mumbling] Found a guy, I'm gonna pay him to kill Jimmy and we can leave this shithole. - Yeah, we'll we're gonna get caught. - That's why I want you to follow behind me. You make sure no one's at my back. It's gonna be okay. - Okay. [melancholy music] You're gonna see Naomi again. - Okay. - You're gonna see your baby again. [weeping] [mellow clanky music] - [Jackson] I really did my job well, but damn, my home life was a wreck. - I want us to work. Work, that's the problem. Oh God, Jackson, I do miss you. [phone ringing] - Darla. - I was just thinking about you. - I hope that's a good thing. - I think I can-- - I've been thinking Darla. I'm not gonna take every case that comes down the pike. How's your mom? [staticky chattering] - She's not happy I'm here back in London, though. - Yeah. - I want us to work, Jackson. I really do. - I promise I won't blow it this time. Just come home. - [Darla] I'll be home soon. [tense music] [mystical music] [whimpering] [chattering] - [Man] I didn't take your skateboard. - [Man] I know you took it. - I don't even have your skateboard. - I know, you liar. - [Man] I didn't take your skateboard. [thudding] [groaning] - [Officer] Follow me. - Hey Sarge, got her again. Maybe she shouldn't wear red. - I like it. - Wanna book her? - Yeah. [mumbling] - Can you help me find my dog? His name is Jovar. He's this small. [chattering] - Sergeant, I need your attention on this right away. And help her find her dog. [mystical music] - [Jackson] Me, trying to be a super cop, I totally ignored the one person I loved the most. Darla. Damn, I miss her. [phone buzzing] - [Answering Machine Woman] Sorry, no one is available to accept your call. Please leave a message after the tone. [beeping] - Hi Darla. [mellow music] I don't know how we got here. All I know is that I miss you. I hope you get this message. I love you. [uptempo music] This is Jimmy. He's the lowlife scum of a human being pimp. He's the poster boy for depravity. - Are all the little fillies in my stable in a bad mood today? - How many more months do I have to pay interest with my ass, literally, to Bobby fucking No Nose? - 'Til Christmas. - I don't think I can make it past Halloween. - Next time you won't be so eager to borrow money from the mob. Payback's a bitch, isn't it? [sniffing] - Once I pay off Bobby and pay you off, I need a little vacation. - Where are we gonna go? - No, I said I need a little vacation. - Oh yeah? That reminds me. Bobby called. He needs his next party this Sunday, right after nine o'clock mass. - Do you have any compassion for anyone? - Yeah, for me. [slapping] [groaning] - [Jackson] Yeah, Jimmy had a real way with the ladies. [heart beating] - Where the hell's Bolt? Get your ass in here. - [Jackson] And it seems like I was in the chief's office every other week, too. - Sit down. - [Jackson] I might as well have my name on the office door. - You know what this is? Tommy's report on you. It's bullshit. On top of that, I've got the D.A. on my-- - Chief Stone. Oh, just the man I wanna see behind bars. And you're gonna make it happen, so help me or it's your ass, too. Jackson, you have screwed this division for the last time. You're going down. - I can't keep putting up with this. I can't keep covering for your ass. Are you drinking? Get your personal shit together, will you? Get West in here. [mumbling] This is a buddy of yours. You gotta check him out. And you two, get your shit together, too. Well? Go. [tapping] - Bobbo, hey. Yeah, yeah, we got it set up for Sunday. Yeah, I wanna get you two, no, okay, okay one's enough. Yeah, you're gonna like her. Okay, have a great day and oh, got another call coming in thanks. Vince. Hey, I'm glad you called. Yes, I was gonna tell you the good news. Everything is going really well and I'm gonna get those files from you Tuesday and I think the new office is gonna be open by wuh, excuse me just a sec. Excuse me? You're coming out here looking like this? Go fucking change. Go. Anyway, what I was saying is, I think that things are gonna be pretty cool because once we get these girls out and get new business going, I think I'm gonna be happier. You wouldn't believe what I go through. My God, it's, all the meditation, all the drugs, all the praying in the world hasn't helped. These girls just don't really know their job. Look, I'm gonna have to call you back. - I got raped tonight. - You're a dirty little whore. That's kinda like saying a boxer got beat up or something. Who cares? God. - I can't keep doing this. I wanna see my mom and my baby. - And you will, I promise, very soon. - I wanna hold my baby. - I know. And you keep saying this but [mumbling] focus on business. Okay? I've got some things coming down the pike. I can't really tell you about everything but everything's gonna change and you're gonna be a free woman very, very soon but you gotta keep your little mouth shut unless I tell you to open it for certain things, if you know what I mean, okay? [sniffling] - I was raped tonight! - God sakes, woman. I'm trying to run a business here. [sobbing] [funky uptempo music] - Get your ass back in the car. - Who the fuck you think you're talking to? - I'm talking to you, man. Get your ass back in the car. [tense music] - Hey, hey. What's going on here? [tense music] - [Jackson] Toy cop. - You guys accepting applications? - [Jackson] The tip came in that my old fight promoter was doing something illegal. - [Receptionist] Hi, can I help you? - [Jackson] I'm here to see Danny. - [Receptionist] Do you have an appointment? - [Jackson] So, I do what I do best. [tense music] - [Danny] I got the delivery. - Danny, Danny, Danny. - [Danny] Just because you killed somebody in the ring, you pussy out. And you cost me millions. - You know why I'm here. What is it this time? Gambling, prostitution, hmm? - [Danny] No, I play chess. [tense music] [thudding] [grunting] - [Man] Stop, ha! [tense music] - Yeah? You guys are coming up short. Need to get your asses over to 42. Like now. Now. Hey, wake up. [groaning] [mumbling] - See ya tonight after business. [chattering] - Little light on the weight. - [Man] Here you go pops. Bye. - [Man In Red Hat] Can you do a fucking lightweight? Come on, man. - Don't worry about it. It's not your fucking problem. - Took you so fucking long? - I was only up there for 10 minutes. - You was up there for 20 minutes-- - Whatever, man. - [West] What the fuck happened-- - Man, get outta here. - How's Darla? - That's it. Get outta the car. - [West] What? - I'm so tired of your shit, man. Tired of your shit. - What you pushing on me for, man? [thudding] The fuck, Bolt? We're partners man! You can't do this. - [Jackson] He was lucky. I felt like shit, but a call came in about a drug deal going down in one of Danny's apartments. [tense music] [uptempo beat music] [thudding] [grunting] - Fuckin' bitch. [thudding] [grunting] [crashing] Mother fuck. - What's up? [gunshots blasting] [uptempo music] - Efficient. [gunshot blasting] - Fuck. Punk mother fucker. [thudding] [grunting] [cracking] [yelling] Son of fucking bitch. [cracking] - Oh my God, what the hell's going on in here? [gunshots blasting] [uptempo music] - Before you go out, be sure [mumbling] mess. - [West] Screw yourself. - West, freeze. But then I realized I couldn't pull the trigger on my gun. - Matter? Can't pull the trigger? Let me help you. [gunshot blasting] [tense music] [melancholy rock music] Managed to slip through the hands of some rookie cops. [mumbling] [melancholy rock music] Diamond's 11:30 john found her dead and called 9-1-1. [melancholy rock music] While Jimmy rejoiced over the paramedic's inability to resuscitate Diamond, Sky was busy doing what she needed to do to make a downpayment on Jimmy's demise. Jimmy cried like he cared, but it was all just an act. Jimmy had a real way with the ladies. - Yeah, I know, I know, he's a problem, but it's our problem, not yours. Look, just do your job. We'll do ours. - You wanted to see me, Chief? - Yeah. I had you transferred here for a reason. Your buddy's in trouble and you're gonna watch him. And you can start with his wife. But not like West. - [Darla] David, is this really necessary? - Darla, you and I both know Jackson didn't kill anybody. His partner. I've got one word for you. Framed. - Look, I can assure you he is not here. If you want to protect me, you can do it from outside, okay? Now, I'm gonna go upstairs to rest and when I wake up, I want you out of my house. - I know he's here, Darla. [door slamming] - Hey. - Good job, baby. - He's gone, I think we're safe. - He's the only one I trust. - I know. - Hey. I need you to give him this cell phone, okay? Don't let anybody see you do it. - Okay. - I'm gonna follow up on a few things, kill some people and call him in the morning, alright? - Mmm hmm. - I gotta go. - Okay. - I miss you. - I miss you, too. - Remember the time when we went swimming and you fell in the pool? [chuckling] - Yes, I remember the time. - Those were good times. [melancholy music] - When this is all over, we need to talk, okay? - Okay. [traffic zooming] According to the news, that man Bolt was on the run, but I was actually on the hunt. - Hey David, I got a line on that Texas game. You in? - Oh yeah, man, I'm down. - Let's do it. - Let's do that. [phone ringing] Hello? - David, hey it's J.B. You got anything on Danny? - Nah, and do I got something for you. - [Man] How about making that bet partner? - Ugh, get outta here. He's got this big old fight lined up for Saturday night. Yeah, supposed to be five guys against one. - This Saturday? Like, in a few days? - Yeah. - Are there any details? - The who's who of fighters and some surprise kickboxer. Yeah, some sort of mystery man. - Yeah, I think I know who the kickboxer is. - Yeah. - Is there a website? - No website, huh uh. - Look, man. I got a little problem I need you to help me with. - So, that's why your wife left you. [chuckling] - Man, I'm gonna kick your ass. - Too soon? - Got this pain in my head. My God, it's ringing, it hurts. Can't pull the trigger on my gun. - What? - I need you to research Danny. I'll catch up with you later. You can find Danny in one of two places. His office or his bar. I decided to start with his office. There was something about that silver briefcase on his desk. I just had to know what was in it. Hey! [thudding] [grunting] - Freeze! Don't move. [chuckling] Toy cop, huh? [thudding] - Toy cop. Sky had everything planned out. What she needed to do was bring the money to a guy in the suit, sitting by the window at the coffee shop at a certain time. What could possibly go wrong? - Looks like we both clean up pretty well, don't we? - I was just gonna get coffee. I was gonna see if you wanted anything, too. - I want a lot, starting with your pretty little ass in this chair. You know I was up all night tossing and turning, agonizing over what to tell you about my new business. - What new business? - My brother is a hired killer. [slurping] He's been teaching me everything. Pretty cool, huh? - [Waitress] Can I get you something to drink? You're good for now? - I'm doing fine, thank you. I did my first practice kill last night and I love it. It's even better than peddling flesh. The other thing that I haven't been telling you is that every day I have to make a phone call to my brother down in L.A. and every day I have to remind him not to kill that nice woman and not to kill that little bastard baby. And I have to tell him not to go to 4999 Manchester Circle. [tense music] Apartment 18. - You know what, Jimmy? Someday, you're not gonna hold all the cards, and when that day comes, you're gonna be sorry. - Here's to that day being many years in the future. - I'd spit in your fuckin' face right now if I didn't know that you'd like it so much. - You paint me to be such a perv, Sky. But look at yourself. - I'm paying for my sins, okay? At least I'm trying. You. Someone's gonna come along and have to make you pay. - I can't wait. [tense music] - Ladies and gentlemen, I am Cecil J. Blondie, at least I used to be. So good to see you all coming out here today to Sergeant Pepper's, especially you, Frank. We've got a great show for you lined up today as long as Jennifer remembers to kick a little higher, keep her leg in the air and it shouldn't be too much of a stretch for her, we like to hope. Go ahead and put your hands together but keep it in your pants for the Frat Girls! [clapping] [uptempo sexy music] - Okay, let's start with the burlesque stab and go. Slap. [mumbling] - Yeah, babies, come on. [chattering] - Hey there, hey, hey, hey. - [Woman] Son of a bitch! [grunting] - [Woman] Get out. [screaming] - [Jackson] My bout with depression was getting worse and worse. Killing Danny may not prove my innocence, but it just might cheer me up a little bit. - [Danny] Jackson Bolt. Hard time as always, my brother. - Give me one reason why I shouldn't fuckin' kill you right now. - Oh, Jackson. 'Cause I'm the guy with an eyewitness that knows you didn't really kill anybody. - But that would implicate you. - I never let the truth get in the way of a good story. - I'm not following. - And you never will, because while you're running around playing checkers, I'm playing a thinking man's game. A civilized game, chess. It's more civilized and highly profitable. You see, half these cops, they wanna kill you. The other half, well, your partner was no saint. He was screwing a bunch of guys' wives. [thudding] [grunting] [tense music] - [Ruby] Fuck you and your badge. [thudding] [grunting] [thudding] [grunting] - Bitch. [screaming] [breathing heavily] - Hoo hooey, Jackson. You still got it, boy. But remember my friend, king beats pawn every time. - [Jackson] Pretty sure that was an audition for Danny's event in a few days. What the hell was he up to? - Hey pumpkin, you look so sad. What's going on? You know what today is? It's take your kid to work day. But you know what? Instead of you following Daddy around all day, I need you to sit tight and wait. Now, give me your hand. - [Sky] What? No. - I said give me your hand. - You're gonna be [mumbling]. [dinging] [blasting] - [Sky] What'd you do? - I'm starting to get the hang of this. [blasting] [uptempo hip-hop music] â™ª Here's my rebuttal â™ª It's my time, my time, my time â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game â™ª Hear a lot of music â™ª Even in my dreams â™ª Sweet funky music with a melody â™ª Straight from my heart â™ª I'm here today â™ª To display my music in a funky way â™ª Everybody sing on â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game â™ª Don't hate the player, hate the game - What the hell?

You're almost outta beer. - What the hell you doin' in my refrigerator, anyway? - I got's thirsty. - Then drink. - It's like I was sayin' fellas. You know, I hired you guys to track somebody down. Turns out, I know exactly where he is. - [Biker] Where's the guy? - It's Jackson Bolt, cop killer. - [Biker] We got a job to do. The address is 357 Gibbs Lane. We'll see ya there. [engines grumbling] - Okay, we've done this before. Just trying to get something done. Sure you can handle it this time? Alright, so I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. Just for the record, I'm gonna record this conversation, alright? Okay, so what I want you to do now is just try to relax, alright? Just lay down. Let your mind wander, see if we can get something done, alright? So, try to remember all these things that happened to you. Take me back there. Make me, make me remember them. Let me see them. Tell me. [funky beat music] - Man, why do we have to do this? - Just relax. Take a deep breath, alright? One more time. Tell me what you see. Tell me what you hear. Tell me what you smell. [mumbling] bringing back all the things you went through, All the things that happened. Just, if you relax, will come. Don't fight me. Just relax. Talk to me. [funky beat music] We go through this all the time. Tell me something. Tell me what you hear, what you see, what you smell. - I see a guy. Maybe two. I'm sorry, Tommy. I can't do this. - Stop being a goddamn pussy, alright? Talk to me. Tell me what you see. What you hear, come on. [funky beat music] - Two guys. I think it smells... Two guys are hittin' me. - Come on, talk to me, talk to me. - Man, can I just go get a beer? - Yeah. This one you're gonna have to pay for. Get out. [funky beat music] - We're gonna take him upstairs. Upstairs. [funky beat music] [thudding] - [Jackson] Tommy told me to go upstairs. He knew something wasn't right. [gunshots blasting] I see a guy. Okay, I see two guys. Two guys. - [Tommy On Phone] What are they doing? - [Biker] What? [thudding] [grunting] [tense music] [gunshots blasting] [thudding] [gunshot blasting] - What's up with the gun, baby girl? - Fuck you. Old man. - Whoa. [thudding] [grunting] That's easy to say. You got your gun in your hand. I got my piece over there. I mean, it's easy to do. Let me put this, for a second, let me put this here. Can you hold this? [thudding] [grunting] [funky beat music] [thudding] [grunting] [funky beat music] [tense music] - [Jackson] Still think I'm a pussy? - Comme ci, comme Ã§a. [gunshot blasting] [tense music] - [Darla] Jackson, I love you. I love you. - [Ruby] My grumpy little baby. Mama's got a surprise. - 'Swhatever. I'm not used to having my plans fall apart like this. - Just 'cause you never done anything like this before baby. - You gonna be alright? - Now will you listen to my idea? - Oh, I don't know. I just can't find Jackson. I can't-- - Shh, shh, shh. There's only so many places he could go to have that thing removed. I'm already on it. - There was something in my head that had to come out. I just remember waking up in the hospital. Did they get it out? - Seriously, Bolt? Pizza? You are on a clear liquid diet. That's your dinner. - Hell yeah, they got it. It's right here, man. - Oh. Who knows I'm here? - Man, I checked you in with a fake I.D. Only me and Darla. - Oh, Darla? Man, she's gonna want to have to come up here and-- - No, man, no. Now, calm down, she's good, I told her all about it. Everything's fine. - What about the blonde? - Ah, that would be Bonnie Cardoza. Yeah, she works at Genotech. She's friends with your boy, Danny. I think he paid off her gambling debts and in return, she got him this mind control device. I'm sure they have bigger plans than just you. - Wow. What'd you do with her? - Oh, you mean like unnatural acts? - [Jackson] No, no, asshole. Where is she? - She's fine. She's safe. We did just that homework like you asked. - Good. Good, did you bring my bag? - [David] Duh. It's right here. - Get me my thing out my bag. - You get up outta that bed and I'll give you that thing in your bag. - I'm gonna kick your ass, man. - That's what you keep sayin'. Look a little wobbly there, Chief. [tense music] I think you're looking for this, right here. You ready? [uptempo beat music] - I'm looking for someone. Jackson. Jackson Bolt. - Sorry, sir. [mumbling] - Wrong answer. [gunshots blasting] - Bolt. [thudding] [grunting] - Man, you almost got us fuckin' killed. - [Jackson] I like his suit. - Hey, it will fit you, I think. - Freeze, get on the fucking ground! [gunshot blasting] [tense music] [gunshots blasting] - Bolt! [gunshot blasting] [tense beat music] - I'm good, man, I'm good. It went straight through. Take this, get 'em man. I got your back. Go get 'em, go get 'em. - Number One, check in. - Number One, checking in. We got cops, sir. Too many cops. I think we gotta get outta here, man. - I don't pay you to think. I pay you to do your job. Now, if you leave this building without securing the package, I will hunt you down and kill you personally. Do you understand? - Roger that, sir. [gunshot blasting] [thudding] [grunting] - I don't have a gun. [gunshot blasting] - Number Three. Do you have the backpack? - 'Course I got the fucking backpack. [tense beat music] Oh, fuck. [beeping] [blasting] [thudding] [grunting] - Mr. Roundtree. We need another specimen. - [Mr. Roundtree] I just peed. - Well, drink some water. We need it. Ring the bell when you're done. [thudding] [grunting] - I gotta get outta here. Time for a mixed drink. [swooshing] Ah freedom. [thudding] [grunting] This bitch just got peed on. [thudding] [grunting] - Yeah, yeah. [yelling] [thudding] [grunting] [cracking] [breathing heavily] [tense beat music] [thudding] [grunting] [gunshot blasting] [breathing heavily] [beeping] - [Surgeon] Okay, ladies, let's get this liver in. I've got a date tonight. - [Nurse] Thank God. - [Surgeon] There's always an option. Hey! - Shh. - [Nurse] What are you doing in here? - Shh, shh, shh. - [Surgeon] Excuse me, sir. Sir, can't you see-- - Shh. [beeping] - [Surgeon] Gentlemen. - Shut up. - [Surgeon] Gentlemen. This is an O.R. - I said shut up! [clicking] [beeping] [clicking] [thudding] [grunting] [groaning] - Sorry, man. It's the way it's gotta be. [beeping] - [Jackson] In case you were missing Jimmy and Sky, here they are, right on time just to do a little dirty work for Danny. - So, what you're saying is, this is a two-man job? - Like I said a hundred times, yes. Of course it is. - What I mean is, I can't fuck up or you lose your paycheck. [grunting] [smooching] Don't make me fall in love with you. - Jimmy, you're not getting me. - Oh, I'm getting you alright, Sky, but what I don't want is for you to get kinda goofy all of a sudden and change the plans because I might accidentally grab this gun and spray your gray matter all over the concrete out there. Do you want that? Your 100% commitment to me is more important than this little gig here. Now, let's get out there and do it. [doorbell ringing] Mrs. Bolt? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Officer DeSouza, this is Officer Wright and we're here to replace the gentlemen who have been watching you. - Oh, what happened to Greg? - He's dead to the world, tired. We had to let him go. - There is one thing you could do for me. - [Jimmy] Sure. - I need to go somewhere. - You know what? We have strict instructions to take you nowhere unless you had to go to the hospital. - Yes, I do. I need to go to the hospital. - [Jimmy] Which one? - Mercy Hospital. - Let's get crackin'. Come on. - Great, I'll just get my bag. - [Sky] After you. - Thank you so much for this. [screaming] - So sorry about this. You know what? Seems much worse than it is, but now that we're together, I think you and I can make things work. We're both victims here. - I'm nothing like you. - Yes, you are. You know, you're a lady, and I understand that. But right now, you're my lady, and when we get through this little ordeal, I think maybe we can both escape. - Don't be stupid. He'll kill us both and you know it. - You know what? I don't think so. I'm extremely valuable to him. - Pfft. - He's got a lot of plans for me, and you know what? I've got a few plans for you. But, do this right, this doesn't have to go down your throat 'cause I'd hate to see what would happen to those beautiful [mumbling]. So, what do you say we work together? Okay? - Fuck you. - Okay. That's a great idea. - Don't touch me. - Oh, please, dear. You don't understand me at all, do you? - Keep away from me. - How could I keep away from something so precious like you? Please understand. [spitting] Oh! Oh my, this is always how it starts. I think this is yours. [clanking] [whimpering] I think she doesn't like me. - Zip it up. One day that dick's gonna get you killed. - Idea. Threesome. - Fuck you. Partner. [laughing] - Your man is an asshole. - He's not my man. So, maybe you can help me get away from him. - You got a gun. - This? It's not even loaded. He took my clip. [thudding] [chuckling] - Comfortable? Is that better? 'Cause that borrowed suit you was wearing, it was a little snug. Kinda worried about ya, thought you were gonna start singing soprano in the Vienna Boys' Choir. Tough name. Anyway, it's like they say man. All's fair in love and war and us, we're almost the end of the line. - End of the line? Danny, what are you talking about? - Mother fucker, chess, I told you. I'm about to castle my rook and I know you wanna knock all the pieces off the board, make a big mess, but this game's still in effect. - What game? Danny, what are you talking about? [doorbell ringing] - Ha, not now, my friend. I think we have guests. Ruby? [doorbell ringing] You're gonna love this. Check it out. Look what I did for you. Ladies and gentlemen, I know you have a lot of questions. Let's get started. - What are your plans for a sports themed fashion line? - Hey, hey, hey, this is a Danny original. This man looks good, don't he? - When was your last fight? - It's been awhile, it's been awhile, but it'll be alright. - Is there any truth to the rumor that this fight isn't properly sanctioned? - We have all of our paperwork. I'll have my secretary get it to you in the morning. [mumbling] - Danny, I heard you were indicted for illegal sports activity. Can you explain? - It's all conjecture. Nothing's ever been proven. - I heard that you had to fight four pit bulls just to prepare for this fight. Is that true? - Hey, hey, hey. No dogs were hurt during the training. We're animal lovers. We are dog people. Love dogs. - Mr. Bolt, it's been 10 years since your last fight. Are you properly trained for this? - This man is a machine. This man is an officer of the law. He is a policeman. Every day out there on those streets, that's his training. He's gonna be ready. - Danny, is there any truth to the rumor that you're connected to a prostitution ring with a man named Jimmy? - Ha ha ha! This press conference is over. Ruby. - [Ruby] You heard him. Get the fuck out! [chuckling] - Cheers. Y'all have a good day. Thank you for coming out. Appreciate you. - [Jackson] Remember that guy who helped me pull the trigger? Yeah, that's Rusty Brown. Another two-bit wannabe gangster that works for Danny. His prints were all over my gun. - I tell you I had nothing to do with it, man. You don't have any weapon. - You need us to show it to you, dummy? We found the gun used to kill Detective West Rassmuesen. - [Cop] It's got your fingerprints all over it. - I been set up. - We got evidence tying you to this and 10 other homicides. - [Cop] You've got five minutes to think about what you're gonna do. It's gonna change your life. - Not in a good way. He ain't no killer. We should just let him go. - [Cop] Yeah, bullshit. - Just open the door, we don't got enough evidence, do we? - Yeah, like I said. - We're gonna be here all night. - Have you talked to your wife today? Do you know where she is? - Do you want me to throw the fight, Danny? Is that it? - Throw the fight? I want you to die in the ring. Make it look good. Nine, 10 rounds, but die. And that's gonna be checkmate mother fucker. - [Jackson] How does a man on the run wanted for killing his partner [mumbling] boxing ring? Somehow, Danny took care of everything. [chattering] [thudding] [mumbling] [thudding] [bell ringing] What about that chick in my dreams? Turns out, she was an expert at implanting mind control devices. She worked for Danny, or that's what everyone thought at the time. - Get the fuck up. And you are gonna tell me everything I fucking wanna know right now. - Please. - I wanna know where Darla is! - You don't understand. - [David] I don't care. - He's going to kill me! - I need to know where Darla is now! [crowd chattering] [thudding] [bell ringing] [mumbling] - Whoo! [tense music] [thudding] - Yeah! Yeah! - Whoo, whoo, whoo! [crowd cheering] [thudding] [tense music] - Oh Jackson. What the fuck did you get me into? - Red, are you there? Red, it's about dinnertime. - Yeah, one more perimeter sweep, then I'll take it in. [tense music] [gunshots blasting] [thudding] - They should stop the fight. [crowd chattering] [thudding] [cheering] [thudding] - [Jackson] All I had to do to save Darla was allow myself to get beaten to death. I'd do anything for Darla, even laid out my life, and Danny knew that. He bet his entire life savings on these fights tonight. [crowd cheering] - He's gettin' up. I can't believe it! [crowd cheering] [crowd chanting] [gunshots blasting] [mumbling] [chattering] [mumbling] [gunshots blasting] - Man, you guys really need to learn how to shoot. [chattering] [thudding] [bell ringing] [thudding] - You think you're okay? - You do care about me, don't you? - I just think we make a great team. - Yeah, I think so too. - Were you serious about going to Mexico? - Deadly serious. - So, we're really leaving tonight? - We are. I've got the tickets right here. Midnight tonight. - Can you do me a favor, then? Please? - What is it? - Will you call your brother and just ask him to leave my mom alone and don't do anything to my baby? Just, just-- - Come on. - Just for a few days. - Why? Why? - Please. - Why should I? - Please. - Bro. Yeah, it's me. You know what? I'm not gonna be calling you for a few days. I'm gonna be gone and when I get back that's when I'll call you, so don't call me, okay? Goodbye. [thudding] [grunting] - Ha! [stammering] [thudding] [grunting] - Oh! [stammering] [gunshot blasting] - Are you okay? - I am now. Where's Darla? - [Sky] There. - This is the fighter that Jackson Bolt is waiting for. The only fighter to beat Jackson, 10 years ago. Over to Sheila, with the interview. - Thank you, Rick. Hi, I'm here with Abrafo. How are you feeling about today's fight? - I ain't thinking about it. - Is there anything new that we should be expecting from you today? I know you're a very successful kickboxer, so, we're all anticipating to see what you do in the ring. - I'm gonna do the same shit I did to Bolt that I did last time, whoop his ass. [crowd chattering] [thudding] - [Jackson] Abrafo was the one fighter I could never beat. [thudding] [crowd chattering] I guess this is the end. [mumbling] - Oh. - [Darla] David, my God. Get these things off me. - [David] I got you, I got you. [whimpering] [weeping] I got you. - [Darla] Where's Jackson? [phone ringing] [crowd catcalling] - Hello? Jackson, it's for you. - Jackson. She's safe, I got her, man. I got her. [crowd cheering] [thudding] - I don't know what the heck's happening. [tense music] [crowd chattering] [bell ringing] - I don't believe this. He's gonna throw him outta the ring! [thudding] [crowd booing] - [Jackson] Danny lost every cent he had that day. [crowd chattering] [thudding] All he had to do was open his briefcase and press a button. [mumbling] [chattering] [crowd cheering] [thudding] - [Jackson] Unless, of course, someone thought Danny was too much of a liability. [blasting] [crowd catterwalling] [thudding] [mumbling] â™ª I'm a statement â™ª [mumbling] â™ª No feelings at all - [Darla] Is that pineapple pizza I can smell? - [Jackson] Yeah, I was hungry. - And you're not having this. - You know you shouldn't be eating that. - I'm hungry, come on. - Why can't I look after you? David, hi. The big guy was just talking about you. - Yeah, talking about kicking my ass, right? - Oh, that's what it was. See, I thought he said, "Kiss my ass." - No, I know I'm right. I'm sure of it. - Sky, how are you? - Marvelous. Now that I met the most beautiful man I've ever seen. - Beautiful. She calls this beautiful. [chuckling] Whatever. [mumbling] - Shall I give you guys a minute? - Nah, we just came in to check on ya, buddy, see how you're doing. Want you to rest up. We'll come back and see ya tomorrow. - Love you, partner. - Love you too, brother. - Thank you, Jackson. - Get outta here. [phone ringing] - [Darla]} Hello? - Hello, Darla? - Hi. How is your day going? - Nah, it's all going good. It's all going good. - Can he make an appointment? - No, that's a good idea. I think it would be nice if both of you came in together. I'd love to see both of you, okay? - Thanks, Tommy. - Alright, I look forward to it. Bye. - Tommy. - Oh. You know how I feel about him. - I know, but you need to see him. - Go get me a pizza. [chuckling] - Stop it. [chuckling] - Oh, God. - Get some rest, okay? - Alright, love you. - Love you, too. - Get outta here.
