Who are you?! Hello. I'm Nancy Drew. It's nice to meet you. May I ask who you are? Guess. All right. I'm guessing you two are working with Lawrence McNabb, the locksmith, that he gives you the keys and you're responsible for the recent string of burglaries. However, you should know the DA's only interested in McNabb-- you two could make a deal with him. And that Charlie the security guard is about to walk through that door. : Hi. Listen to me. I'll get Pastor Murray to drop the breaking-and-entering charges if you agree to some kind of counseling. Anger issues don't just go away. I don't need a shrink! : Yeah, you do. He gets cranky when he hasn't eaten. I told him, you know, go have a snack. I said, "Before we get here, you better have a snack." Oh, one summer, we were on Fire Island... Hey! Psst! Not with that story again! Hold on. What's that? My sleuth kit. Flashlight, fountain pen, notebook, magnifying glass, fingerprint powder, digital recorder and... ...one of Hannah's lemon bars. Bess, is Nancy okay? Are you kidding? She's loving it. Okay, here he is. Nancy? Hi, Ned. So, I had this dream during my nap today where you went off to California and met that guy on Smallville, and you got amnesia and... literally forgot you ever met me, and then I turned into a squirrel. Anyway, what do you think that means? : Um, Ned, can we talk about this later? I'm just a little busy. Yeah, sorry. O-Okay. Not appropriate, Ned. You take naps? What's going on? Is she okay? Hey, now, don't worry, I just talked with her-- she's doing fine. That Nancy's my best man. I-I mean, she would be if she were on the force. Fine. Therapy. Great. I'll call the D.A. back. : I just want to thank you, Nancy Drew. I've always heard the nicest things about you, the way you solve mysteries and you help people... Steve... please don't thank her for turning us in. I think Crankenstein needs another lemon bar. Well, I thought the Crankosaurus was extinct. I don't know about this. Well, I'm sorry, Cranky Doodle Dandy. I can't do this. Gary, we made a deal. The deal's gone wrong. Hey, where is she? We need her! You take that side. Hey, Gary, look. Hey! Let's get out of here. It's Nancy! It's Nancy! Hi, everybody. Hold it there! Hold it right there! Oh, my goodness! Hold on! Hold on to that gutter! Come on, Nancy, hold on tight! Hold on, Nancy-- we got the fire department here! That's all right, Chief-- I'll be down in a jiffy. Hang on, Nancy! Yay! Yay, Nancy! Are you okay? I'm fine, Dad. Really, in the sleuthing business, this kind of thing happens all the time. It really isn't a big deal. It is a big deal. I ran from the courthouse in the middle of that eviction case, which the judge, he... he didn't appreciate. Where is your car? Around the corner. Is now a better time? 'Cause I wanted to give you this. Wha... You know, your hunch was right on the nose, Nancy. Just wish you could've clued us in a little earlier. Nancy! Nancy! Thank God! Nancy, right here. Hi, Nancy. Smile! Thank you. Bye. Nancy, what are we gonna do without you? It's only for a few months-- I'll be back. The image of your mother. Do you remember her at all? No. She was such a lovely woman, so kind and intelligent. Just like you, Nancy. Bye, everybody. Bye-bye. So long, Nancy! Shall we all pray for her safe journey to California? Sure. Dear Lord, please watch over Nancy Drew and protect her as she strives to solve mysteries that are beyond the abilities of local law enforcement agencies. Dad, I... I want you to promise-- no more sleuthing, at least while we're in California. You go to school, shopping, spend some time with teenagers. It's what you're supposed to be doing. Give it a try. You know, I've always picked cases that help people. "Others first." That's right. But this one... this is a little different. If everything goes well, I could start making some... real money. We have enough money, Dad. Well, I'll be the judge of that, thank you. At any rate, I'm starting something new-- I-I can't be worried about... How you doing, John? Yeah, I'll meet you at the deposition as soon as my train gets in. Well, we don't have an airport out here. I wish I was kidding. This is a terrible development! What are you gonna do? You have a mystery to solve in La-La Land. I'll figure something out. I hope. Ned! With all the commotion, I didn't get to give you this. I needed a new compass. The old one's wobbly. Thank you. In case I'm not with you on your birthday. That's so sweet. I just don't know if I'll get to use it. Why? Well, my dad let me choose the house we're gonna live in, so I chose one with... With a mystery. But not just any mystery. One of the greatest unsolved cases of all time-- Dehlia Draycott. The movie actress. Mm-hmm? Before your time. 25 years ago, at the height of her fame, she disappeared for five months. Nobody knew where. And when she came back, she threw a giant party. But she never went downstairs to greet her guests. She was found floating in the pool... dead. Gee, that sounds like fun. I know, right? But I didn't tell my dad about the house, and now he's not letting me do any sleuthing. I mean, there was a hostage situation, so I can kind of see his point, but, um... Hi, Ned. Bye, Ned. Got to scoot, Nancy. Mr. Drew! Some Pfeffernusse, just in case. Oh. And some ginger cupcakes-- your favorite. You're gonna get hungry on the train... Nancy! Nancy! Hold on! Thank you so much. Bye, guys. Nancy! : Bye, Nancy. Now, you're gonna have a safe train ride, okay? I'll miss you. Don't get hurt. And please, you have to keep us in contact. Um, Ned, don't worry about that guy from Smallville. He's not my type. - Nancy? You have a type? Chief McGinnis! I just want to let you know that I'm not sleuthing anymore. Bye! Nancy Drew not sleuthing anymore? I don't think so. * Come to California * * Baby, let it all hang out * * Come to California * * Tell us what it's all about * * But watch your mind little bit, 'cause the future * * Is beginning * * Now, now * * Flew in to L.A. * * Caught a screening of your lifelong dream * * Blew it in L.A. * * Now you're desperate to create your own scene * Oh! * Watch your mind little bit * * 'Cause you're headed into the machine * * Come to California * * Come to California * * Come to California * * Come to California * * Come to California * * Never want to go away * * Come to California * * Come to California * * And watch your mind little bit * * 'Cause you're headed into the machine... * Hi. This is Carson Drew-- I'm running a little late. Hey, Dad, don't you think people who talk on cell phones, uh, miss things? Like what? Like that woman in the street. Oh! Uh, uh, Mr. Drew? Nancy? Yes. : Hi. Thank you so much for not running me over. I'm Barbara Barbara, of Barbara Barbara Realty. You're here. Oh, I'm gonna get right out of your way. How do you love it? Oh! Gorgeous! Welcome. It's not exactly what I had in mind, especially given the price. Well, as I told your daughter on the phone, you do pay a premium for m... Oh, I am such an oaf. Um, as you were saying, you pay a premium for history, architectural significance. I mean, Dad, look at this woodwork. Yeah, what-what she said. Who's this? Dehlia Draycott, the great film legend. This was her home. Didn't your daughter tell you? We've, uh, both been somewhat busy. Oh, excuse me. Yeah, hello? Do you know what? With a little tweaking, you could be adorable. Um, thank you? Yes, you're just a makeover waiting to happen. I'm gonna give you the name of my stylist. Oh, come on, let's go upstairs-- I can't wait to show you. Did you hear something? I suddenly got a chill. Have a look around if you want. Don't be afraid. Please, don't be afraid of me. I'm here to help you. You don't understand. I want to... I want to help you. I love that. They fall for it every time. That's the projector. Oh, it's from one of her old movies. There are so many booby traps all over this house. People get so scared sometimes, they wet their pants. Where's the gift shop? That's the spirit. Look, Miss Barbara Barbara, I know I called asking for a house with a mystery, but, um, things have changed, and... it's complicated, but... we're gonna need a different house. Honey cheeks, read the fine print: no refunds, no exchanges. And besides, you know, there's nothing else available... in your price range. I'm just gonna use the gents, then I have to run to that deposition. Watch this. Something just happened in the bathroom which I am at a loss to explain. : The house has a haunted theme. It's like a theme park. It's so fun, right, Dad? No. Oh, did I mention? There's a strange caretaker. He lives in an apartment down the hill. Uh, what's your name? Leshing. Let me know if there's anything I can do for you. Nancy Drew. Thank you very much. Uh, Leshing, we need to talk about the lawn. Mm. Dad? M-Mr. Leshing? Hmm. Someone stole my moccasins and an important folder. Mysteries just find you, don't they? I'm letting the professionals handle this one. I'm on hold with the LAPD. Oh, calling the police to solve a crime. I like it. It's been 57 minutes. They must be having a busy night. Yes. I'd like to report a theft. I'm sorry! A favorite pair of moccasin slippers and a Pee Chee folder have been stolen. Please send an officer over immediately. Someone must have told a joke over at the precinct. Yeah. That's it. Because it would be irresponsible for a police department to laugh at a crime. You're right. Yeah. Dad? Hello? Leshing, this is Nancy. I needed to prove your whereabouts. Go back to sleep. Someone's in the house. How did you get here so quickly? If you're accusing me... The attic. How is it possible for someone to be in the attic and escape while we're coming up the stairs? Is there another staircase? No. Do you believe in ghosts, Mr. Leshing? I am a ghost. The Four Seasons isn't haunted. What do you say? Dad, you hate hotels. Spa treatments... room service... These books must have been Dehlia's. May I borrow some? If it were up to me, I wouldn't let anybody in the house, period, but you're paying the rent, so do what you want. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... Good night. I like him. So... turns out there's a mystery here after all. Dad, that mystery stuff is so boring to me now. I've completely moved on. Mm-hmm. It was really just a phase, you know, like papier-mache or puppets. It's over, done, finished, gone forever. Got it. "Z... I'm sorry "to have vanished like I did. "I know you have been looking for me. "Something important happened last week. "I can't be the Dehlia I was anymore. "I'm writing a new will. I need to make provisions for someone else. D." D is Dehlia, but who's Z? Who's the someone else? No. I'm not sleuthing. No, sirree. You're just reading a letter that happens to be a major clue in a fantastically famous mystery. But that means nothing to you. You're gonna go to bed and be reasonable, Nancy. You're going to a new school tomorrow. You're gonna make wonderful friends. You're a normal teenager. You really are. Yeah. * Let me ask you, boy * * Do you think that I'm pretty? * * Will it be forever, or will you up and leave? * * You're pretty much amazing * * And you've been there for me * * Together we're beautiful * * I want you to stay * * Hey * * Come on, I know what you're thinking... * Yes? The quadratic formula. Negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. * I can tell that we're gonna be friends * * You're pretty much amazing * * Whoo-hoo * * You're pretty much amazing * * You're pretty much amazing * * Whoo-hoo... * I only had enough time for 12 flying buttresses, but in actuality, there are 26. "Then I'll be brief. Oh, happy, dagger, Thank you, please. "Here is thy sheath. Thank you. There rest and let me die." The show is Pippin, and I just wanted your name. * I don't ever want it * * To end * * You're pretty much amazing * * Whoo-hoo * * You're pretty much amazing * * The way that you are * * You're pretty much amazing * * Whoo-hoo * * You're pretty much amazing * * While we're driving my car * * You're pretty much amazing * * You do it for me * Hey, baby, how you doing?! * You're pretty much amazing * * I like your style * * You're pretty much amazing... * * You're pretty much amazing * * Whoo-hoo * * You're pretty much amazing... * Hi. Hello. Hi. Uh, I noticed you were wearing penny loafers. Did your podiatrist suggest them, or are you being ironic? I like old-fashioned things. Oh, we've noticed. Penny loafers are practical. Well, we may be on the brink of a penny loafer fashion moment. Or not. That was awesome. Give that cupcake back. Shut up! Come on. That's a good cupcake. Principal Fineman, I feel strongly, students should be given a more nutritious alternative in the cafeteria-- perhaps a salad bar. A salad bar. Terrific idea. Yeah. Hi. I think the principal wants to yell at me or something. Let's see. Oh, yes-- there may be traces of lead paint in the utility shed next to the volleyball courts. But I can't be certain until the lab report comes back. Lead paint. That's bad, right? Very bad. But there's no need to panic. Finally, I urge you to offer a course in CPR. I noticed it wasn't part of your curriculum. I'm certified, and I have found great peace of mind knowing I may save a life someday. So hot! So hot! So hot... Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching! Where's the money? Cha-ching, where's the money? Corky! Corky! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! M-My brother's choking! My brother's choking! Time-out! Time-out! Does anyone know CPR? Does anyone know CPR? I do. I know CPR. Excuse me. Whoa, is he okay? Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay. Is he breathing? He's moving... Should we call an ambulance? Oh, you idiot! You were supposed to kiss her, lip lock-- that was the plan! * How * * Does it feel * * To treat me * * Like you do? * * When you laid your hands upon me * * And told me * * Who you are * * I thought I was mistaken * * I thought I heard your words * I'm looking forward to the journey, and I don't care if a woman unaccompanied is considered to be shameful. I... I've done nothing wrong. My heart is... Yes? Your heart is...? - Cut. - Uh... Sorry. And... action. I'm looking forward to the journey, and... I don't care that... I feel sick. I need to stop. Cut. Quiet, please! What are you doing? I-I-I'm sorry. I'm looking forward to the journey... That door was unlocked. Um, the shutters had rusted closed, and the bulbs were all burnt out. Well, leave it on. Well... I haven't been here since the night she... You were here the night she died? How long did you work for her? The year I got out of the service, I went to work at the studio. They sent me over here to project a film for her, and she asked me to stay and take care of her, so I did. That was 1971. When she disappeared, did you know where she was? No. She never married, and she seemed to be very private, but there must have been a... there must have been a man... someone she loved? Every man who met her fell in love with her. It just couldn't be helped. I just don't know if she ever felt love herself. Hi. Yeah, I'm sorry about the weirdness the other day. I have to say, my feelings were a little bruised, but, um, thank you, Corky. An apology is the sign of a gentleman. Inga wrote me in to the shenanigans. She's my sister, but I also think she might be the Devil. Also, you know, I thought if you gave me mouth-to-mouth, it would be a fantastic way for us to get to know each other. The truth is, you're awesome. By the way, did you know there's a mystery to this house? I know. I only recently discovered that movies aren't shot from beginning to end. So I took the last movie she ever made and reassembled the shots in the order they were photographed. O... kay. I just noticed something strange. The last month before she disappeared, she's only shown from here up. Maybe she was pregnant. She didn't have any kids-- never married and no kids. It's just a hunch. Also, the photograph in this magazine is dated just after her reappearance. There's an "X" on her robe. I believe that insignia will tell us where she was hiding. I've called all the hospitals and hotels that include the letter "X" in it, but, so far, nothing. I need to talk to someone who's an expert in clothing. Oh, and one more thing. She's often with this man, but he's always obscured. A hand at the edge of a picture, a silhouette, even a blur. I think she called him Z. I have to find out who this man is. I just have to solve this case. What do you think? I think the ability to sleuth is an attractive quality in a woman. Mm. Hey, don't they have a costume department on the set of every film? Yeah, but you should know that movie people are kind of crazy. Oh, goodness, how crazy can they be? Really crazy. You're fine. Oh, I just had a question. And I'm all out of answers. You look '50s. Go to set. But I was just wondering if maybe... Now! Here we go! Okay, we're moving. We're moving, people! We're on our way! We are moving! I, eh... uh... All right, let's just shoot the rehearsal. Has anybody seen Mr. Fancy Pants? Right here, you idiot. Nickname. I love a nickname. Not a nickname, Andy, it's not a nickname. You really are an idiot. Oh, all right, all right. I, um, uh... Okay, we're shooting the rehearsal! Excuse me, sir, no, sir. No, I... By the way, it's "action," not "begin the acting." Action. Locking it up! Last looks everybody! Last looks! Walking away! Walking away! Quiet, please! And we're rolling! Oh, you're cute. Thank you. Okay, you hate crime. And action! Hold him right there, boys. Spider Winetrap. As I live and breathe. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. Excuse me, I'm sorry, but... What? I'm sorry. This just feels inauthentic. Feels what? Well, the scene takes place in the '50s, but you're reading Miranda to the suspect. Um, excuse me! Why in the name of sweet Christmas is this tiny person talking?! Well, reading of Miranda upon arrest wasn't law until '63. Is that right? The scene is still delicious either way. What's your name? Uh, Nancy Drew. I'm Bruce. All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you direct the movie, Nancy Drew? Listen, Nancy, would you, would you consider, you know, directing this film? 'Cause we can get rid of this guy in a second. Is there a law against common courtesy in Los Angeles? Courtesy is so awesome. I'm really into it. In my book, courtesy counts. I'd like to read that book, Nancy. It's not an "X"; they're palm trees. Okay. What does that mean? The insignia on her robe. It's, um... something "Palms." Oh, now I get it. Just kidding, I don't. Southern Pines, California Hot Springs... Twin Palms Bungalows and Spa. There was a fire some 20 years ago and all the records were burned. And on top of that, I'm afraid our guest list is confidential. Oh. Where's the closest hospital? All the children born in one week, 24 years ago? Yes. Well, all the ones given up for adoption. See, the birth mother, she may have left money for the child... I'm sorry, but those records are sealed. Only a court order can open those records, and even then, only by a child seeking a parent. Are you the child? No. But, um, thank you anyway. Here's a blondie for your trouble. Did... did you make these? No, Hannah our housekeeper, back in River Heights, did. She sent over a tin. She's a wonderful baker. It's so weird-- my mother made these when I was a kid. I-I haven't had one in years. It's so perfectly moist. Come here. The county... recommends a pediatrician to new adoptive parents. The doctor's files aren't sealed. This might help. Thank you. And you didn't get that from me. 24 years ago. Wow. That is so long ago. Yes. It would have been a first appointment-- a newborn. I know it seems a little disorgani-zized, but I know where everything is. Oh... Ow... Right there. Here it is. There were two newborns that week... No, make that three. Oh, but, uh, I don't think I can release any information. Let me call headquarters. Oh! Maybe that's them. Hello. Hi, Carol, it's Jimmy. Oh, Jimmy. Yeah, no, I was looking for it, and I found it, I found it. I did find it and it... Oh. That's not it, but it's pink and, uh, it wasn't, no, it wasn't where I thought it was going to be, because it's... - I think it's yellow. I put it somewhere else. Yeah, oh, boy. Oh, boy. I'm going to have to call you back. Can you get it to me? I'm going to have to call you back. Nice try, squirt. Nice try. * On a nice day * * On a nice day * * I don't care what they say * * I don't care what they say * * On a nice day * * On a nice day * * On a... * Hello, I'm looking for Jane Brighton. Are you Jane Brighton? Are you Martine Dahlberg? Yeah. Why? I was just wondering, were you adopted? Are you Susan Thabit? Uh-huh. Were you adopted? Are you Martine Dahlberg? Yes. Were you adopted? Hello, um... Can I help you? Sorry, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Uh-uh. No. No. Nope. - No. -No. -No. - No. -No. -No. Hello? Um, is there a Jane Brighton here? That depends on who's asking. Were you adopted? Yeah. Who are you? You're who I'm looking for. I am? Hi. You're kidding. Did your parents tell you that you were adopted? It wasn't hard to figure out. I mean, I didn't look anything like them. My mother passed away, and then my father, um... I had to get away from him. Uh, I left home early. Dehlia Draycott! Wow. Dehlia may have made a provision for you. If we can prove that you're her daughter, there may be some money. Is this some kind of a practical joke? Oh, no. I don't joke. I get that a lot. I'm 12, but I skipped a few grades. Because you were ahead academically? Heck no. There just wasn't any action in junior high, so my dad made a few calls. Anyway, I was, uh, wondering if we could do, like, a dinner thing, like, Saturday-ish? Not a date. Corky, you've been really nice to me... I'll show you the sights, and we'll have a few laughs. But there's this guy back in River Heights. Oh. Ouch. Okay. Well, you still need to eat, and it's not a date. Okay, seeing as how it's not a date... Go! Go, go, go, go! They almost hit us. Hurry! Go, go, go, go, go! Hey. Hey! I wonder who tried to kill us. Yeah, I'm wondering that, too. In fact, I'm kind of freaking out about it! Well... usually when someone tries to kill me, it's because I'm on to something. Oh, you have a cut. There were dealer plates on the SUV. I made note of the make, year and model. Plus the damage sustained from hitting the barrier could help us identify it, too. You're just not like the other girls, Nancy. Hello? Do not look into this Dehlia Draycott business. If you proceed, you will be harmed. Oh. Do you understand? We're not interested in mud slide insurance, but, um, thank you for calling. Have a nice day. Whoa, what's this? I apologize, sir. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nancy Drew. It's very nice to make your acquaintance. I've been trying to set up an appointment with your office, but, um... Posture, eye contact. Pay attention, people-- that's breeding. I-I was just wondering if I could have five minutes to discuss something with you. Anytime at all. Here's my card. Oh. Thank you. It's about one of your clients, a movie star. : All my clients are movie stars, muffin. Well, I may have found some evidence suggesting that... Astonishing. Um, it may imply that... Absolutely astonishing. As I was saying, um... I'm very disappointed, Senator. Well, as you know, you do owe me a favor or two. Well, talk to somebody else on your staff. Maybe they can help you. Jane, are you there? Hi. I saw the lawyers who represent the estate today, and... It's all right, I don't need any help. What do you mean? Don't you want to know if you're Dehlia's daughter? Just leave us alone, okay? You seem like a really nice person. I'm sorry. The will is in the Chinese box. So there is a will. Miss Draycott collected chinoiserie. Last year, the owner sold off the most valuable pieces, against my wishes. Do you remember the name of the dealer? You ask a lot of questions. Is it this place? I noticed the ad was circled. Do they have the box? Let me tell you something, young lady. Everyone who has tried to piece this thing together has run into trouble. Hello? So you should be getting an early birthday present "slash" reward thing, for going along with my no sleuthing law in California thing. Dad, you shouldn't have. I don't really deserve it. Yes, you do. I know it hasn't been easy for you, and this will make me feel a little less guilty. What, what is it? Ah, just walk outside. Hi. My sister dropped me off, and now she won't go away. Leave! My roadster. Dad, how did you get it here? Happy almost your birthday. Ned! You drove this all the way here? Uh, yeah, wouldn't fit in my suitcase. I've missed this car so much. And you-- I've missed the car and you. Oh, uh, Ned, Corky, Corky, Ned. Ned is my... really good friend from River Heights. River Heights, right. That's in one of those flyover states. Did I interrupt something? Yes, actually, you did. Hello? Hello? Oh, Dad. - Nancy? Thank you so much. We have to go. Corky's going on a date with her? Whoa. Nancy weirdo has, like, two dates. Oh. That other one is cute. I mean, I don't usually go for the "just back from slopping the hogs" type, but... he's cute. * Have you got the answer? * * Have I yet won the part? * * Is this just your way of breaking my heart? * Hello. Would you like to order some drinks? I'll have a glass of milk, please. Ah, milk-- how refreshingly wholesome. I'll have the exact same thing. Who is this person? Nancy and I met, and things just clicked. We laugh, we talk, we keep it real. We're basically best friends. It's funny that she never mentioned you. Hey, buddy, she wants your drink order. Um, can I get an iced latte? No latte in Chinese restaurant, silly. Yeah, silly. Excuse me...? No latte in the Chinese restaurant. Don't talk to me, okay? All right. Wow, this is fun, huh? Um, you know, Ned and I have known each other since second grade. He helped me solve the mystery of the missing chalkboard erasers. It was a janitor. Ooh, fantastic! Oh, my gosh. How funny. Here we are and here you are. Hi. What's your name? Ned? You're not sure? No. I mean, yeah, yes, I'm sure. Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Hey, hey, guys, don't gang up on me. I'm sensitive. Hello. I'm looking for a box. That is, one in particular. What kind of box? Um, Chinese. Well... you've come to the right place. So this is why you wanted Chinese food. What are you guys doing in here? This is so nonlinear. Everybody pick a row, check inside each box. We're looking for a will. Wait, what's over there? Hey. Guys, did you see this box yet? Nothing there. Whoa. No, no, no, don't... don't touch. Hey, hey, watch this top. That is very expensive. * I'm too insistent like nobody showed me * * How to keep relationships * Did you see this? It's big. Put that down. What? What, you think you're funny? Do you think you're funny? So not cute. There is one more. So, Nance... what's the deal with you and Ned? Do you hear something? No, I mean, are you two, like, a thing? Um... Excuse me, I have to defuse this bomb. No kidding. Love is a battlefield. That's the SUV that tried to run us down! The side's damaged. Come on. What was that? Are you okay? What was that? - Hurry, we're losing them. Oh, so you meant literally a bomb. What was that? What was that? Are you okay? Hello? They turned up that street. Hold on a sec. I thought we were driving away from them. That's the only reason why I got in the car. Buckled up? I'm fine. Buckling up. Say we actually do catch up with them, what happens then? Seriously. It really gets my goat when someone tries to kill me. It's so rude. But it only makes me want to try harder. Then let the horses run! We will go the posted speed limit and no faster. No! Everybody in the universe drives over the speed limit, Nancy. What Nancy's trying to say is that the ends do not justify the means. Your means will lose them. It's important to judge the ends and judge the means independently, in order to do what's right. Didn't you promise your father that you wouldn't sleuth? Aren't you breaking that promise? What are you going to do? I have to stop working on this case. I have to stop and be normal. What's this? Oh, just normal stuff. Normal teenage stuff. Okay, carry on. Ow! He just pinched me. Deal with it. If we're gonna baby-sit him, we should get paid. Ned, why is your shirt all wrinkled? 'Cause my closet's six inches deep. That's not possible. How could... Show me. What are you guys doing? "Hey, Corky, we're super glad you asked. Would you like to tag along?" Seriously. Ooh, God! What is going on?! I just fell down. But I'm fine. I still don't know what's going on. Whenever you feel like letting me know. A secret passageway. So this is how the intruder's been getting upstairs. This is nuts. Ned, will you get my flashlight? It's in my kit. Wouldn't this be considered sleuthing? Who are we kidding? I can't stop. Once I find the will and determine the identity of Z, I'll tell my father everything. He'll understand. I mean, how else am I going to help Jane? It's important. Don't you think? Yeah. Uh, what was that? I think we just had an earthquake. Hello? Nancy! Are you all right? Where are you? I'm in the basement. Do you see anything? I found a tunnel, and I'm going in. If I'm not back in ten minutes, that means something bad's happened. I don't think that was a joke. Hi! A tunnel? In the laundry room? What the hell is that all about? John Leshing. He's a tenant in this building. Hmm. He's the caretaker of the Dehlia Draycott estate. If anyone knows about the tunnel, he does. That man has always given me the willies. The drowning kittens type. You know what I mean? Hi. These are for you two. Here you go. Oh, okay. These are for you two. I hope you attend. Wow. I know that she's weird, but we have to go. Why? Ned, my future husband, is going to be there. Jane? It's me Nancy. I was wondering if you and Allie wanted to come to a party. Oh, my goodness. Wow, guys, your streamers look great. Let's see yours. Yeah, yours are all right. Downloading's cool... but nothing sounds like vinyl. You couldn't be more right if you tried, Nancy. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hey, I brought a few friends. I hope you don't mind, all right? Sure. Oh. I didn't get the memo about it being a retarded theme. Hey, Ned. Hi. Oh, can I take your coat? Okay. Um, refreshments are in the dining room. We'll be having a taffy pull later, guys. Oh. Come on in. Hi. Hi. Hi. Refreshments in the dining room. Oh, hello. Hi. Oh, you look lovely. Hmm. Leshing, come quick. So did you grow up in River Depths? Tell me about it. Is there a river? River Heights. Oh! Uh, yeah, there's a river. Oh, oh, I knew that. I totally knew that. How did I know that? Oh, hey, hey. Oh, you want to dance, right? Hi. Um, I just wanted to ask you if you knew about the secret passageway. I think you got your answer. Are you Z? Miss Drew... I suggest you rejoin your guests and enjoy the party. Hello. I warned you, drop this Draycott business. Who is this? Please, stop calling here. Nancy? Oh. Hi, Dad. Where are you? I'm going to be even later to your party than I said. I'm sorry, honey. Is everything all right? Sounds a little crazy there. Yeah, everything's totally mellow. Are you sure? Absolutely. Hurry home. Happy birthday, Nancy. Back off, man! Hey! Somebody call 911! You! You know CPR. Come on, do something! Trish is choking! This is not a joke! Out of the way, out of the way. Coming through. Oh, my God, do something, do something. Somebody call 911! They'll be here in 10 minutes. Does she have any food allergies? Uh, she is insanely allergic to peanuts, but she didn't eat anything. I had a peanut butter cookie, and we were making out. Oh, my God. I need a knife and a ballpoint pen. Huh? Here. Here you go. I'd like to remind everybody that unless you've had advanced emergency medical training, you must never attempt this on your own. Holy crap. You know, I have to admit, I thought you were some insane freak idiot person before, but you're not. You're pretty terrific. Anyone can learn emergency medical procedures. I'm talking about how great the party was. I mean, saving Trish's life was fantastic also. Anyways, I'd like to take you and your little friend Ned out shopping. You really do need a decent outfit. What happened? It was a lively party. Almost everyone had a good time. I take it you're Nancy's father. That's right. We responded to a complaint from a neighbor. Dad, this is Sergeant Billings. No, no, no. Let me say something. You had a wild party. You blew it out when Dad was MIA, damage was done, things went amuck, I get it. Congratulations. Getting rowdy is part of being a normal, non-sleuthing teenager! All right, that's a first. * All I need is the beat * * To keep this party live * * All I need is the beat * * To keep it jumping, yeah * Hi. Obviously, someone here needs a little help with their look. Oh, it's not that bad. Oh, please, it's a fashion teardown. You have some nice pieces, they're just not really working together. Me? I was talking about her. Oh, sorry. Wow! Where did you get that dress? Um, I made it, from one of my mother's patterns. Oh! It is just darling. I love the sincerity. I have to take your picture. Uh, you know what? I just remembered how much I really hate this store. Excuse me? I wish you could stay longer. My mom said if I stayed past the weekend that she'd turn my room into a den. Really? Anyway, Nancy, I just want you to know that I'm not interested in that Inga person. In fact, she scares me. And that if you like this Porky guy... Corky. ...it's all right with me. Ned, he's 12. You just seem to really like having him around. Ned, can I ask you a question? Mm-hmm. Can you tell when a girl looks at you and is thinking how much she likes you and wondering if you like her but thinking how important it is for you to say how you feel before she says anything more about how she feels about you or anyone else that you might be jealous of, because she's already saying how she feels in her own way? Can you repeat the question? Your cab's here. Sorry to see you go, Ned. I'll, uh, see you soon. Bye, Ned. Jane, are you all right? No. Child Protective Services, they, um, they took her. They took Allie. They said I was an unfit parent, but it isn't true. I didn't do any of the things that they said. Come in, come in. You're always able to help people. Well, I can certainly try. Why don't you come downtown with me tomorrow morning. I will. Thank you. Thank you so much. Sure. What's the connection? How did you two meet? I'm... Dehlia Draycott's daughter. You're what? Wait... Dad, it's so late. Jane's tired and so am I. Let's go over all this in the morning, in the promising light of a new day. Right. Have you been sleuthing? Dad, do you really think I've been sleuthing? That's not answering my question. You're not answering mine. Your what? What? What? What? I'm going to bed. Good night. Listen, I have to tell you something. Right after you first found me, someone came to my apartment-- a man. He said if I ever tried to prove that I was Dehlia's daughter that I would regret it. That's why I was afraid to talk to you that time. What did he look like? He was big... um... dark hair... scary. And he had one pale blue eye and one very, very dark. Someone has filed grievances against you, but I don't know who yet. But it isn't true; none of it happened. How can they just take a kid away from its mother? I believe you. And I think a judge will, too. It just takes time. We'll get her back, I promise you. Now... is there anyone who might have something against you? Dad, look, there's something I need to tell you. It has to do with this whole... Carson! Nancy. After Jane's little revelation, I found out who the lawyer for the estate was, and I gave him a call. He and I are going to talk over something privately. Do you have your car? Down the block. What are you two, um...? Dinner, tonight. I've got a lot of questions, and I think you just might have the answers. Feel like some hot cocoa? ...Channel presents the life and death of Dehlia Draycott. It's so weird-- I never used to think about her at all, and now it's like I see her everywhere. What if I am an unfit mother? I mean, I don't know what I'm doing. No one ever taught me what to do. Jane... Nancy, I don't think you understand what it's like growing up without a mom. Actually, my mother died when I was very young. Oh, God, I'm sorry. I didn't know. You've been so nice to me. Sometimes, I-I think I can remember her, but I never know if what I'm remembering is something I saw in a picture... or is just made up. She's, um... she's a mystery. Someone in the village told me that the will is in the Chinese box. Wait a minute. What are we looking for? A clue. It's empty. You must make the dragon bow. The will. I must have fallen asleep and heard this dialog. I finally found it. Dehlia used a clue from one of her own movies to show someone where to find the will. Now all I have to do is make the dragon bow. Okay, you lost me at "dragon." I'll be back later! Hello? Hello, Mr. Louis? Are you in there? Hello? I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner, but this means so much to two of my friends. It's fine. It's the will. If you want it, you can have it. Thank you so much. "I give all my property and assets to my daughter, born July 28, 1981." I knew it. Dad. - Hi, honey. I have to talk to you. What number are you calling from? My cell phone-- the one you gave me. I didn't give you a cell phone. Honey...? Dad, I have to get off this phone. Everything's fine. I'll see you tonight. Nancy... : So they're the ones who've been breaking in. They've got to stop. It's not your fault. You do believe me, don't you? Go check on her. Wait, I want to see this part. Kids will love it just for making chocolate pasta. She's not there. Look again. She's not there. Excuse me. Hey! Go get her! Hey! Hey! She's getting away! Jump! I don't... Go! Go get the car! Idiots! Right there. Hi, Dad. Are you okay? What happened? Just your run-of-the-mill car accident. I swerved out of control because, um... because men were chasing me. I've been working on a case. Uh, I'm going to give you two some time. Thank you. I started to tell you today. You could have been killed. Do you realize that? I was just trying to do the right thing. This is a very dangerous city. The world is not like River Heights. I know. I mean, I tried to be normal. I really tried. I just start working on something and... I can't stop. Wonder where you got that from. I mean, the idea of a girl out there without her mom... Dehlia wanted to leave Jane the estate, and I found the will. Like you always say, others first. I just wish you had talked to me about this. It'll be okay, Dad. We'll work it out. You're my guy. Hey, kiddo. Mr. Biedermeyer. Uh, your father and I were going over some business when we heard. I hope you're all right. I'm fine. Good. He's offered me some consulting work, and I can do it from home, so we can go back to River Heights. And he pays a lot. Oh. You know, I couldn't help but overhear before about the mystery. Did you ever find the will? I did. Hmm. Dehlia used one of her movies as a clue. Oh. It was hidden in a secret compartment of a Chinese box. Nancy always gets to the bottom of things. Well, my firm would certainly be interested in seeing that will. You know, Mr. Biedermeyer wasn't always just Dehlia's lawyer. He was her manager, as well, from the start. He made her who she was. Oh. Then he brought her account to his law firm and, uh... Well, it's time to sign on the dotted line. Eh... That's, uh, quite a signature. It's my middle initial-- for Zachary. Z... Hmm? Where is the will? Um... Where is it, honey? Do you know? You know, uh, this is a little awkward. His firm stands to lose more than a little income if the money from the will really does go to Jane. : Dad, we have to get out of this car now. Why? Uh, excuse me, sir, can you please stop the car? Nancy! Nancy! Dad, get away from them! Excuse me, miss? Oh, hello, honey! Ah. Uh, the phone's over there, honey. Sergeant Billings. Do you know if a man named Doshel Biedermeyer ever rented in this building? No. No, he owns it. He owns the house you're in, too. He's a very rich man. There she is! Uh... is there a back door anywhere? Yes, honey, right over there. Tell Sergeant Billings to send a car to the house. Get her! Oh! Open up! Open up! Break it down! Kick it in! Where's the will?! I don't think I should say. It's my insurance that you won't hurt me. I'll squeeze it out of you. Tell me something first. I-I-I'm... I'm-I'm just really curious. Mm-hmm? Why did you kill Dehlia? After she gave up the baby, she went kind of crazy. She was gonna quit the business and run off with that caretaker. He was the father. Whatever. She was my only client. She was gonna fire me. I spent 20 years of my life building up her career. I got mad; I reacted violently. I felt kind of bad about it for a while, but I'm okay with it now. Leshing is Jane's father. Mm-hmm. Does he know about the baby? It doesn't matter! Now, where is the will? I-It's right here. Give me... give me the will! Give... Ah-ah-ah-ah. Just do it. If you shoot me, it'll leave all sorts of evidence. Very messy. Strangulation... leaves a traceable handprint. What do you suggest? The best way to kill me? Hmm, let me think about that. Um... Enough of this crap. Put the gun down. Hey! I'm just really curious. Mm-hmm? Why did you kill Dehlia? After she gave up the baby, she went kind of crazy. She was gonna quit the business and... Oh, my God, Nancy! Nancy! Nancy! Oh, my God, you won't believe what's happening! Hey, Mr. Biedermeyer! Inga Weinstein. I'm in water polo with Courtney. Your granddaughter. Yeah, I remember you. Hey, Lurch, digging a hole or something? Here, okay, we had to show you this. Oh, my goodness! It's called "The New Sincerity." Yeah, once again I'm on the forefront. I see something I think is cute, I start wearing it, and in, like, five seconds, it's a total trend. Penny loafer fashion moment! Ah! Oh, I need to borrow that coat. Leshing, thank you so much. You're welcome... Nancy. There's something you should know. It's about Jane. She's your daughter. Uh, uh... Hey, hey, hey, you with the shovel. It's him. Have you seen my father? A party! - Nancy... Nancy, darling, are you okay? Oh, good, good. Oh, hi, honey. Hi, Mr. Drew. I was locked in a trunk. What happened? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, let's get him up. All right, easy, easy, easy. Looks like, uh, my new job might not work out now. Yeah, maybe not. So, wh-what exactly happened? Dad... do you really want to know? Yeah. Uh... Do I? * ...Honor to love you * * Still I wonder why * * It is * * I don't argue like this * * With anyone * I don't know what to say. * But you * * We do it all the time * * Blowing out my mind * * You got this look I can't describe * * You make me feel * * I'm alive * * When everything else is au fait * * Without a doubt you're on my side * * Heaven has been away too long * * Can't find the words to write this song * * Of your love * * Still I wonder why... * Nancy, I...

Well-well, what are you gonna do with this place? I'm gonna to live here with my kid and anyone else who needs a place. Oh, well, I think maybe you and I should talk this over before you... Feel free to leave at any time. * ...Understand the way it is * * It's not a secret anymore * * 'Cause we've been through that before * * From tonight I know * * That you're the only one * * I've been confused * * And in the dark * - Allie! * Now I understand * Allie, come here! * Yeah, yeah * * Ooh, ooh, ooh * * Ooh, ooh, ooh... * * I wonder why it is * * I don't argue like this * * With anyone but you * There it is, just like clockwork. What? Postpartum depression. You're sad the case is over. That's ridiculous. I'm glad it all worked out. You're only happy when there's trouble. This I know for sure. But... that's who you are, and it's all right with me. Ned, that's so sweet. * Just like * * A star across my sky * * Just like an angel off the page * * You have appeared to my life... * Nancy! Yes?
