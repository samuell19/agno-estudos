- Is everything all set, boss? - It's all set to go, except Marney. Yes? - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. Thank you. Ambrose? - Sir? - My razor is missing. The black one. - But Sir, I placed it there myself. - This is hardly my property! The printing of R. And M. Is entirely different. Is that the best you could do? You didn't bother to look for mine, just bought a cheap copy! Thought I wouldn't know my personal property? Leave! Ambrose! - Sir? - How is my daughter? Miss Denise is doing well, Sir. Miss Denise is sleeping, Sir. Thank you. I told you to leave! Don't stand there behind me. You'll make me nervous. Don't get so nervous. - Who are you? - Don't you recognize your bosom friend? Without a hat? - Legge! - That's right! Joe Legge! You're right my friend. To forget is most unkind. Even though it's 20 years... since you've seen this face. I even remember... - your beautiful wife Cornelia. - Don't you mention her name? - You swine! I'll call the police! - Stop! My Robert, it's pointless to call the police... because I'm free as the air. How does that make you feel? The statute of limitations rescued me. Just because of it, I'm free as a bird. Very unfortunate if I told... Who helped me in a big bank robbery, wouldn't it, Marney? - What do you want from me, Legge? - Oh... nothing. Really nothing. I'd just like to leave a few of my things here at your estate. - What kind of things? - Just a few boxes. I just thought it would be nicer for you, a member of parliament, - to have my things. Don't you agree? - I wouldn't consider it, believe me. - You brought me trouble once... - I understand. You'll understand also. First of all, we'll have a meeting tonight. - You'll be there and I'll explain it. - Meet with you? - That's right. And be there on time. 8 o'clock at the Club Highlow in the Soho district. 13 will be the room number. You shouldn't have forgotten it. 13! Yes. - I remember. - You very well should come because... If you don't come... By the way, I've been told that your daughter is extremely beautiful. I'm sure you'd like her to remain that way. But perhaps... You filth, you! - Who sent for you? - It's 9:30! I was called. There's a pick-up here for my cab. You're mistaken. Who phoned for you? It's all right, Ambrose. It's my taxi. - Oh, but... - You mustn't look so astonished. - Did you forget, how a servant acts in 20 years? - I beg your pardon, Sir? Think about it, Ambrose. Think. It will return to you in a while. Joe Legge! This is patrol car 63. Give me Inspector Banner! Superintendent Sir John will handle this case himself! The super himself? Oh my goodness, the super himself is going to it! - We're really onto something! - Here's Sir John! Thank you. Sir, I've been following Joe Legge. I followed him out to Marney Castle. He stayed there for precisely 9 minutes and 20 seconds. What, have you lost your mind? You allowed a criminal like that to enter a home of a respectable member... - of society and do not arrest him? - I had strict orders not to arrest him! Oh, nonsense! Never mind those silly new orders. Drat it all, no wonder those crooks... Make fools of us! Now listen carefully. Keep following Legge's car and find out where he's going. - But don't lose him! - It's right ahead of us, Sir! You can trust me, Sir. Hello, Horse? Is everything all right? Very good, Sir. Nothing's wrong, Sir. Everything is just fine. Report by phone and don't make a mess of it all. Now, what do you make of that? A rotten gangster like Joe Legge visiting the gentleman Sir Robert Marney? Why? I've got to think about it. I mustn't make a big mistake. It's funny Sir Robert's connected with this man. I'm perplexed. No, there's no connection. I think Sir Robert will call us. You mean to make a report of it? That could be. But then we shall wait and see. Sorry, Mr. Gray is busy. - Gray here, who is it? - This is Sir Robert Marney speaking. - You might know of me. - Yes, member of parliament. - That's correct. I must see you at once, it's urgent! - Urgent! Frankly, I'm busy now. Call me tomorrow. - It's a matter of life and death, Gray! - Life and death? - Yes! - This is sounding more interesting. - Please! - Alright, Sir Robert. I'll come. - Boss. The box has just arrived. - The policemen were trying to follow me. - Take a look outside. - Right away, Legge. Yes... Yes. Yes! Just as I thought! Our own master sleuth Sergeant Horse has fouled up again! Don't worry, Sir. One of our woman agents just called in. Joe Legge is at the Highlow Club right now. We even have his room number! That's fine. I have a few small inquiries to ask that gentlemen. Come with us! Get the bridge and the switch house. The switch house... here. And the bridge, here. I'll be hanged if you'll make yourself clear. What are we playing with toys for? You say you'll be hanged? What a choice of words. - But I tell you, Mr. Legge is not here! - Quiet, that's enough. - Here we are! - Alright, there it is. Look for yourself. See? Nothing, it's empty. Why don't you make yourself at home? I've no idea what this gangster proposes to do. But you'll have to... protect my daughter. It's her I'm worried about, now. If anything happened to her, I just wouldn't know what to do. Alright, Sir Robert, I know the problem. My suggestion is you meet him at this Highlow Club. Watch yourself. Try to figure out... what his thoughts are and exactly how you fit into them. Can't be done. Isn't there something important that you're not telling me? Something that happened between you and Joe Legge? You must tell me, even if it happened 20 years ago. Watch what you're saying, Gray. I'm not a liar! Alright, Sir Marney, but I'm not used to working blindfolded. But if you're withholding anything... Come on out of there! I've got a revolver. I'm giving you 3 seconds! - What, are you crazy? - Denise, are you alright? - You could have been killed! - I didn't know it could be... so dangerous living in one's own house! - Why were you hiding, young woman? - I've been in the lounge... - since you and father came in the room. - You should have come out. But he ordered a man to come out. I am a woman. Then may I ask you out in another way? Have supper with me. You seem to be a man who loves to play games, don't you. As a matter of policy, I never accept invitations with a pistol pointed at me. - No, I've had enough. - You can clear the table. - Any more excitement for me? - Fine. - This club is different. - You know, I thought you'd get skittish - coming with me to the Highlow Club. - Honestly? But with a private detective? Your father was... - But which train? - The provincial banks... send their money in for collection at Friday nights in London. This heavily guarded express train leaves Liverpool at 9:08 and... arrives at Paddington Station at 3:58 A.M. I told them not to disturb us! - What is it? - Denise Marney is in the night club. - Guess who her escort is? Johnny Gray! - Who's that? I've been away! - He's the best detective in London! - Well, it seems that Papa Marney... is going to cause us trouble after all! I'll take care of the girl later. The most important part of the operation is precise timing. I'll be informed... if the train is not on time. We'll stop the train at milestone 721. We take over the Bakersville switch house. From there, we change the main signal. The timetable shows that the freight train should be coming through at 3:21. The switch house has only one man in it at midnight. Joyce and Edwards will take care of him. And don't make an error with the signals! It's number TR 39-A! Here, memorize it. The second group will consist of you 5. As soon as the train stops at the signal, 3 of you pull at the locomotive and Take care of the engineer and fireman. The remaining 2 of you will crawl between the second baggage and first baggage car, and uncouple the mail car from the rest of the train! You take the locomotive and the first car another 1000 yards to the bridge. There, Blackstone will be waiting, here at his point. This sighting must be switched 4 minutes after the main signal is turned to stop. It's number OM 38-A. If the OM and TR are mixed up, you'd better order your coffins. - You got me? - Yeah. Good. A truck will be waiting on the bridge. Do you have your guns? You approach the mail car, knock on the door, have your guns ready. Be careful. When the guard answers, you explain to them... the axle is overheated. Must be my visitor. Legge? Joe Legge! Good evening, Sir Robert. - Punctual as always, I see. Have a scotch? - No. - I want to come right to the point. - I understand that. By the way, it was nice of you to bring your daughter here to the club. But she's in such terrible company. Do you come here often? She seems to know you. Denise? But I don't know her. I've never been in this place before. But she does seem to be looking toward us. I'll be back in a minute. She's either a member of the mob, or she's trying to warn us of something. I'll go and check into it. And perhaps I'll find your father. I won't be gone long. - Iggy! How's every little thing? - What do you want? You don't belong here. You're so protective. I'm looking forward to the hour when this place shuts down. - Then you'll be arrested. - Me, arrested? Not me. Never! You will cooperate and take orders from me. Is that clear? I need your castle to ensure a successful plan. You ruined my life once before, Legge. Yes? There's trouble. Wanda was murdered right in front of everyone. By a shaving blade. - What happened? - Not much. Just some girl got it. With a straight razor. A murder? Who? It wasn't your daughter who died this time. But who can tell what might happen? I'll do anything you ask of me, as long as you don't touch my daughter. That's entirely up to you. All you have to do is to get rid of this detective. Then everything will be alright. But the police are coming here. - I'll see that you get home. - No, my car is waiting. - I want Denise to come home now. - I'll drive you back. You do as I say. If this is a private club, you must have a list of the members, - and their homes! - Go and get them. And you, my dear Mr. Gray? Would you tell me what you're doing here this evening? - You will allow me to unravel this? - There's no doubt that you will do that. In answer to your question what I was doing here during this lurid business, all I can say is that the murder occurred while I was dining quietly with a woman. Don't just stand around. Do something! There you are Higgins. Have you found any prints yet, Higgins? Dr. Higgins, please! You always forget that. So sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Dr. Higgins. - Now, what have you uncovered? - Sir, it's dreadful! The dead girl... - The victim was one of our own agents. - I was just about to say that, Sir. - I was unaware at first as she was nude. - I knew because she was wearing... - the official underwear of Scotland Yard. - Our own official underwear? Oh goodness. Terrence, search the entire vicinity. Question everybody! Astounding! You're looking at the dumb waiter, Sir! I certainly am. Hands up! - Ambrose! Why are you here? - I am waiting for Sir Robert. I'm looking for him. - Have you seen Miss Denise here? - She's in there, Sir. I've hidden her from the police so that she wouldn't be found... - in this terrible place. - That's good thinking. Here, hold this. Hey there! What are you up to? Denise? Denise! - Johnny, I'm scared! - My car's outside. Come, hurry! Jump! This way, down here! - Honey, did you find anything? - Oh, pardon me! - Haven't found a thing, Sir. - You will go through the entire club. - Investigate all the rooms. What's this? - This gent refuses to cooperate. - You have a good respectable business man. - Book him! Will do, Sir. - It's the only room that's locked. - A wonderful opportunity for our doctor. Alright now, do your work. Attention officers. When he opens that door, you will advance. He who shoots first lives longest. Something you want? Perhaps when you're not on official business! Sir! Stay where you are! - It's you. - Gray, what are you doing here? I've passed the night in the adjoining room. You asked me to... - keep an eye on your daughter. - He's been a perfect gentleman, father. You go back to sleep, Denise. I'll have a little talk with Mr. Gray. I'm sorry but circumstances force me to dismiss you, Mr. Gray. - I'll give you a check. - Very interesting. I take it then that your daughter will be out of trouble from now on. - If you wish to put it that way, yes. - I understand. - Mr. Joe Legge has gotten to you. - Come to the library. Won't you try to get some sleep? I... I suppose you overheard our little talk. - Well, I'll be back. - But Johnny! You're not going to just... leave? I'm going to Scotland Yard. Why are you so edgy, Denise. Steady there. I'll protect you. Bye bye. Well, Ambrose? - You made it home. - Yes, Mr. Gray. I'd like to ask you something, my friend. Whose portrait is that... - hanging in Denise's bedroom? - It is Lady Marney. Died 20 years ago. Of what? How did Lady Marney die, Ambrose? You are wanted in the library, Sir. You will convey to Sir Robert that it is my thought to complete my work... as soon as possible. Is that understood? Denise. Johnny is fired? Why father? It was necessary, Denise. But you don't have to be frightened anymore. - You'll be safe from now on. - Tell me what happened last night! It can't be true that you've made an agreement with this gangster? What gangster? What are you talking about? I'm not an infant, father! I want to know what's bothering you. Why was that man here yesterday? Why did you meet him at this cabaret? He's bothering you. And you won't tell me why. A foolish mistake. Which I shouldn't have done. It happened 20 years ago. I wanted to avoid a scandal. Election was at hand. House of Commons. - He won't be able to put you in prison? - No. Not to prison. But he might ruin me socially and politically. - Denise! Where are you going? - Something must be done to help you! Denise! You can't fool us with your lies! Here it says, - it was your prints on the murder weapon! - I tell you I'm innocent. I just picked up that razor accidentally. Johnny Gray can exonerate me! You're going to hang, Iggy! And I'm going to watch you swing. Johnny Gray has disappeared. He probably found out... you were going to use him. - Morning! - Mr. Gray! I thought, I heard someone mention my name. - This is extraordinary! Unbelievable! - Why is that, Sir John? - I wanted to explain why I disappeared. - Tell me! Could you tell him I didn't commit the murder? - I really hate to admit it but he didn't commit the murder! - Quiet you! Come! Tell me what you know that I don't know. You know something, Gray. Talk! - Sir John, I must examine the weapon! - Yes, I was right! Come, we go to Higgins. - Hey, what about me? - Throw him out and open all the windows! Watch it! I hate to do this to you, my beautiful Emily, but there must be some sacrifices made. For the progress of mankind. It is hot enough. Everything ready. It is time then. What kind of a Frankenstein have you created here? Please, if you will lie flat on the floor. Right where you are. Just a precaution. It's perfect, wonderful. It turned out much better than I expected! Emily! Can you ever forgive me? There you are Emily. Thank you so much. His mind is brilliant, if he has one. Thank you, thank you. I would however, like to recommend that in the future you have your explosions without me! - Forgive me. - But of course. - Are you injured, Sir? - I'm not sure. - The experiment was a success! - Which? Sulfur potassium concentrate plus phenol pymethol pyrasalon... creates an explosive reaction! The murder of Devonshire has been solved! - The Devonshire murder? - Quite so, Sir. This piece of phenol pymethol pyrasalon was attached by the murderer to the lamp. When his wife came into the room... paloom! Well, that's wonderful! If this is true, Higgins, - I'll award you the title of "professor"! - My goodness, Sir! - What have you found, Gray? - Just what I've been looking for. Take a look, Sir John. - R. and M. - R. and M? R. and M. "And at the latest report, the prime suspect for the murder... of the striptease girl at the notorious Highlow Club in Soho is Joe Iggy. His age is 34. Sir John expects a full confession shortly." A pox on that bloody idiot! How can this happen? We're about to pull the biggest job in the entire history of England, - and he gets involved with Scotland Yard! - He will talk if they push him! - He knows everything about our plans. - I know. But he'll be shot... before he opens his mouth. He'll still be in the interrogation room. And what if he's already talked? - It must be Blackstone. - Open up the door. How are you? Surprised to see me back in circulation? Yes, old Iggy's back in town. - What's the matter? - How did you get out? - The newspapers said that you were... - Testimony? Excellent witnesses, the solid citizen kind. Johnny Gray for example. Are we going to believe Iggy? Johnny Gray helping protect us? Why you! Let go of me! Leave him! I trust Iggy. As long we can't prove he's lying, we'll believe him. Here he comes, now. We've become fast friends. I've convinced him that I'm a liquor salesman. Old Louie loves to drink. Hello Louis! - What's up, how's it going? - Ah, rotten! Here then, catch it! This'll do it! Thanks! Going to go! Don't drink it all in one gulp! There he goes, loping into the switch house. For a nip, as he might say. He does it every day at exactly... the same time. Since the switch house is run by one man. Here comes the 2:22 to Manchester. - Right on time. - We'll want your report later. - There's a woman here to see you. - A woman? What woman? - Miss Denise Marney. Of course, Denise Marney. She's right here. I thought so. I'll send her right up. He'll see you. - Slim, can't you find anything to do? - I'm supposed to stand out in front! Don't argue with me, you numbskull! Oh, my goodness! Excuse me. You're the spitting image of your mother! - You knew my mother? - Yes, I knew her. But I'm certain you didn't come here to see me to talk about your mother. - Won't you please be seated. - No. All I have to say to you is this: - Will you please stop annoying my father? - Your father? You're not very clear. - I just barely know your father. - You know what I'm speaking of. I'm sure that he's been seeing you. If you don't halt your threatening, - I'm going straight to Scotland Yard. - I'm confused as to what you say. - Your father can do whatever pleases him. - Alright. But you've had your warning. And believe me, I'll find out what you're going to do. Just like Mama. Miss Marney is coming downstairs. Miss Marney! - Oh, it's you! - Get out of here! Pig! I'll kill you someday. Miss Marney! Denise! Maniac! What have you done to her? What have you done to Sally? Are you alright? Yes but, murder... - That woman was... Oh, no! - Someone murdered? I didn't do it, not me. Sonny did it. I saw her! You'll regret this! Make that little runt scream with pain! Call Scotland Yard. A woman's been murdered at the Highlow Club! One minute, Sir! What's that? Blackstone! Hello, Blackstone. Come in! - Blackstone speaking. - Listen, do you know Johnny Gray? - And the daughter of Sir Robert Marney? - Sure, I know them both, why? - They have to disappear, both of them. - Understood, Boss. - Gray, what have you done to Denise? - Nothing. He's done nothing. I have to ask you a few questions, Sir Robert. I have no intention of answering questions from you, Sir. I told you... - not to enter my house. - Shall Scotland Yard ask you questions? For an example: Why was your black razor found by the victim? - I've never seen this razor. - R.M. Those are your initials aren't they? Robert Marney. - My butler lost it some time ago. - Ah, your butler! Is Ambrose insane, Sir Robert? Because this murderer is a psychopath. 3 murders by the razor in one week. The woman by the railroad, the dancer Wanda, - and now another one in the Highlow. - I don't understand. What are you withholding, Marney? Is there a connection between the murders and your meeting had with Joe Legge? That's utterly ridiculous, Gray. I feel faint. I don't know what to think. Let me lie down. You have big ears, Ambrose - You speak very loud, Sir. - Tell me, did you lose this razor. - Well, if Sir Robert says so. - That's no answer? You must tell me where. - I really don't know. One day it was just misplaced. I couldn't find it, Sir. One more question. Lady Marney died 20 years ago in this house. - Didn't it happen with a razor? - Lady Marney? We're speaking of murder. - Lady Marney killed herself. - Yes, I know. I've been told that. I suppose you're the one who found her after this suicide. And I suppose Sir Robert telephoned for a doctor. Yes. The police were - if you mean that - much in the dark, not notified. You're right, that's just what I thought. Higgins! Anyone here? Hello, who's out there? - What's going on? - Ah, my dear Master Iggy. Look here! Were you hit by a freight train? - What can I do for you? - The body, man, where is it? You mean me? I'm still alive! No, no, no wait, let me go. There's nobody. Search the whole place, men. Come on, we'll begin upstairs. I intend to find that body, if I have to tear this place apart piece by piece. - Who lives here? - Pia Pasani. She's away on a trip. Alright, open all the doors. You might find a body in there! Break in the floors. - And why are you walking with a limp? - I'll tell you. I tripped and fell down the stairs. This is too much. Too much! Hello, Boss. Hello, Boss! - Yes, what is it? - Send flowers, Boss. - The detective is gone. - I'm sorry to hear it. Good work. Miss Denise! Miss Denise! Mr. Gray has been shot. After he left here. On his way to town. The police say... there's no hope. I'll be a minute. I just can't believe it. I was with him just an hour ago! I don't know anything. I was just told to get you to St. Christopher's Hospital. Now Henry you be a good boy while old uncle Higgins... is golfing in the country for a long, long weekend. If you're good, I'll bring you clover or something. I love you my Emily. I'll be back. What's the matter, Higgins. Startle you? You seem to be going somewhere. Johnny! You shouldn't frighten a person like that. What are you doing here? I'm playing in the country with Sir John for the Scotland Yard golf contest. - You'll play another time. - Another time? Stay with me here, Higgy. Would you happen to have a needle and thread? They nicked me. It's just a flesh wound. Would you help me get myjacket off? - Careful, it hurts. - Oh, my goodness. Careful. I've been to a doctor, he patched me up. Professor Halkin. Charming old gentleman. At one time he was the Marney family doctor. Now take it easy! Tell me how all this shooting all happened. They ambush you? - Yes, at the railroad crossing. - Wait a moment. Yes. A 9 mm bullet. Very likely a shot from a hunting rifle. Yes, that's what it was. - They have a tendency to drift to the side. - You're marvellous, Higgy. - You sound like you were there! - You leave your coat with me, and I'll tell you who shot you. - Higgy? - Yes? - Do you lock this place when you leave? - Certainly, do you think I sleep here? I leave the key on the hook by the door. This is Scotland Yard. Apropos: Take some advice from an old friend. Try to avoid meeting with Sir John. - Just for the next couple of days or so. - Why's that? Are you joking? You make us all rush over to that Highlow Club to catch a murderer, and nothing at all happened! - You mean you found nothing? - Right. Denise saw it! Wait, I'll call her. The Marney Manor. The butler. - Mr. Gray! You're alive? - Of course I'm alive. Hope that isn't disappointing. What? A policeman in uniform, you say? I'll call back! - Denise has been kidnapped! - Yes. By Joe Legge! But why her? Could be because she knows about the murder at the Highlow. Of course, she saw the whole thing. The same reason they took a shot at me. A bodyjust doesn't disappear. They've got it hidden at the Highlow. - And there's Denise. We must get her out. - But my golf championship invitation! You'll stay! There must be a way of finding out where she might be hidden! And you might use all this technical equipment and with it you might find her. What do I have to say to convince you that you're the only man who can do it? We can't count on Scotland Yard and all that red tape. Do you realize what you're as king of me? You're asking of me to lose my pension! No, wait! I think it might be the right time to try my vest. My invention! The most bullet-proof vest in the world. Shoot here, you rat! - You can't murder old Higgins. Shoot! - It's great. Gather up some more of your gadgets. The kind that unlock doors if they're shut. Yes, some dynamite, a bit of TNT. Nitrous oxide? - Fine with me. - Johnny, how about disguises? Yes, that's perfect! We'll go disguised as smoking jackets. We can't afford to arouse any suspicions. Wait until twelve then. At the club. I'll be ready, Sir! There he goes. Did you observe the way he glanced at you? I wonder what he's conjuring up? Shut up and listen. I did it to avoid the chance of a double cross. - I've done everything you asked. - Be sure of it. Stick to your bargain, and your daughter will come to no harm. - Hello. London 1. - This is Liverpool. I'm speaking from a booth in the train station. Yes, Boss, everything is fine. The trucks just rolled in with the stuff 2 minutes ago. And now, they're putting it on the train. Alright Harry, ready to move. - Ready? - Ready! Alright, move it on out! If this stuff doesn't get to London, I'll tell them that you guys stole it! All clear up! It's 9:07, Boss. Is that right? Exactly. It should leave right this minute. It's moving out this minute! Help me! Just like your Mama. Don't bother shouting. - No one will hear you. - They'll arrest you! Mind your own business, my little cheery. It's best you rest for the night. I'll look in on you tomorrow. Where is Mr. Gray? Forget about him. He's been buried! No. No! - Iggy will take something to her room. And you give it to her. - Right away! Hey, Slim, here it comes! Forster in Framingham, here. Our freight train is leaving! It's 4 minutes late. - Can you hear it? - Of course. I'm not deaf! Ok. Get hopping! Ladies and Gentlemen! It's my pleasure to bring you the main act... of the evening: Right on the stage of the world-famous Highlow Club, I present that great dame, Mona Anne Nellie. - Direct from Paris. - Where do we start? Have patience, Higgins. If Iggy sees me, he'll have a heart attack. The expression on his face should tell us what we need to know. Come on to the bar. What's the matter, Iggy? Have you seen a ghost? - He sure does look like he's met a ghost. - That's right, let's get him. He's gone up! I know another way to head him off. Slim! Wake up, you hear? She's gone! Higgy! O sole mio... If we don't get her before Legge finds out, you're a dead man. She must be here somewhere! Come on out, we know you're in here. Help! Hey, take it easy, baby! Denise! Be quiet. Somebody's coming. Denise! London 2, come in! London 2, come in! - London 2 here. We're on our way, Boss. - What's your position now? About 4 miles from the meeting point, Chief. The others are just ahead. - The transport is in back of us. - The train has made up it's delay. - So proceed with the operation. - Understood, Chief. She escaped, Boss. But we found her in the attic. But guess... - who's up there? Johnny Gray! - Preposterous! I saw him downstairs with that Higgins fellow from Scotland Yard. - Blackstone said he was murdered. - He wasn't! But I've got him trapped. - He can't get away. I've got... - That's not important now. Take her downstairs. To the tunnel. If all goes well you follow in an hour! Johnny! Here! I've been eavesdropping, and I heard their plan. - Denise is down this hole. - I don't know how, but you do it. Help! Help! Help me! - That's her, behind those bars! - Get the dynamite! Come! Yes, what is it? Sir John speaking. - Come to Paddington Station at once. - What's at Paddington this time of night? You'll find out. Very important you be there. Who are you? Who are you? - Legge. Joe Legge. - What? Joe Legge! Yes. You just arrived on time, Sir John. It's now 3:19. See? You got me out of bed so that I could see the train station time... - pieces in good order? - Yes, you're quite right! But you see it's now 3:20. - 3:20. Let's go! You! The mail train from Liverpool is due now. You can't stop the train! What do you think we're doing? Pull it! The train is coming. Right on time! Let's go before we lose our chance! What's the matter? Beats me. - Well, let's get on with our game. - Whose turn? Confound it, what's holding them up? Get your hands up. - Stop at the next station! - How can I if the flash is on hold? Just do as I tell you! I'm terribly sorry. I just don't understand. Which bank robbery? - What do you mean? - I'm trying to point out to you... that this is a problem of being associated with underworld criminals. You see, I'm always being suspected when some hoodlums... I thought it would be nicer, if I were with you and you kept an eye on me tonight. Cigarette? I simply can't afford to stay under suspicion. It would be much too risky. - No, it would be tragic. - All I can tell you is this: Something's going to happen tonight, and it concerns the train... due in the Paddington depot at exactly 3:58 this morning! This is quite embarrassing. Look now, you're Legge, giving the police tips! It really is embarrassing. Then let's have a look at the time table to find out which train is coming at 3:58! You can't get away with it. Central office will be calling to see what's up. Now, you tell him that an axle overheated. Say it will be fixed in 5 minutes. Switch house. Phillips speaking. Yes. No, everything is alright. Just an axle got overheated, it will be repaired in a moment. Yes, very well. Not one. Not one at all! There's no train which arrives at 3:58. Therefore, I should arrest you - for giving false information! - Then there must be a train... - which is not on the timetable. - Sure, maybe the circus train is coming! You're kidding me but may I remind you the time is exactly 3:31. Thank you. I wouldn't have noticed myself. How kind of you... Mr. Legge! Exactly 3:31. Here it comes! - Everything alright? - Sure. Everything's fine. What's happening? An axle's overheated. Fire! Hands up. All of you! - She's fainted again? - I just gave her a sleeping pill... to help her get some rest. You go on ahead. We'll meet as planned. There he goes, our hero. The top private detective throughout the world! Last case! Let's go. Close it. I'd love to kill him. Cut him up into millions of little pieces! If that's him again, I'll... - I'm sleeping! - Just wonderful, Sir John! However do you want your friend Higgins to solve this crime all alone? Well if not, you better get right over to Marney Castle. You'll find us there. 3 million pounds, Marney! Pretty soon, every Scotland Yard in Britain will be looking for that booty. But not in your basement. No, not down there. And you're going to keep your mouth shut! What is this? It's Johnny Gray! What was that? You've called the police, why you! Remember Lady Marney! 1 and 2 and 3... And go! - Mama mia! - Bravo Higgins! Bravo! Get them! I'm not dead! It's a complete success! Now I'll have my vest certified by the Yard! Thank you, thank you! Higgy's vests are the best! Stand where you are! All of you! I should say this is the first time in the history of Scotland Yard... that we solved the case before the public knew the robbery had been committed! - Caught this one running away. - Ah! I should have known. - No! Johnny Gray will tell you! - And he had this on him. I only had it to keep the murderer from using it again. Ambrose! Won't you tell me the truth now? Why was Sir Robert blackmailed by Legge? What did happen 20 years ago? Lady... Marney... - at that time... - She was Joe Legge's mistress! When the police were about to get him for robbery, he threatened to unmask her. To avoid a scandal, Sir Robert helped him to get out of the country, right? Yes. It's Legge! I found out about it when I talked to the Marney's family doctor. Denise was a mere 5-year-old when she saw her mother, who was insane then, committing suicide with a straight razor. She sat for hours by her mother's body. She just sat and watched. This whole ghastly scene has affected her whole life. To be certain, I left her alone here last night, with that mannequin and a razor. She mistook the doll for a sleeping woman. She reacted precisely as before. Denise was insane. She'd murder women. She couldn't stop herself. She'd murder any woman, no matter who she was. Until she became her own target. Exactly like her mother 20 years ago. Emily! Emily, what are you doing in this place? My poor dear Emily! Please, Professor! - Professor? - Yes, I said professor. - Your appointment is official this moment. - Professor... Oh Emily, why couldn't you share this proud moment with me? A taxi! I must hurry to the doll company! Maybe a specialist could still save her! THE END
