(female Gregorian chanting) (ominous music) (smooth synthesizer beat music) (foreboding music) (ominous music) (crow squawking) (ominous music) (man grunting) (woman whimpering) (woman gasping) (liquid bubbling) (creature growling) (woman gasping) (creature laughing) (woman yelping) (woman gasping) - Awaken, Sister Sharon. Thou have allowed evil to disturb thy rest. Was it Saticoy? - Mmm - [Nun] He has returned to haunt us. (Sharon gasping) (female Gregorian chanting) - The refugees who have sought asylum are gathering the third harvest of the new water and today we post four more patrolmen to keep Saticoy's devils from crossing our holy boundary. You plan is working and we are grateful to thee, Mother Speed. - I, too, am very pleased with thee, good Marshal. Yay but I still have much to do. We must go forth and bring order out of the chaos. It is our holy mission, as I have seen in my visions. Sister Sharon, please escort Marshal Goodman back to his duties. Want to make certain he has his month previsions. (wind howling) - And what of the fine young man, little Chris, does he still miss his mother? - Yea, verily, the pain is great for us both. My wife could skate like an angel. - But now she is one. - Until my family's reunited in the next life, I think only of the future. My son is the next generation to inherit the restored world. He is the reason I fight the good battle for peace. (wind howling) (ominous music) (women whimpering) - [Woman] Ouch. Stop it. (women whimpering) Ow. Where are you taking us? You can't do this. (women whimpering) - I remember when I was a little girl, when there were no dark nights. All the streets were kept bright until sunrise. Fountains of light everywhere. And we skated for fun. Now, nights are black as ever. And thou either skate or die. (ominous music) (eerie music) (man gasping) (man groaning) - There. (man groaning) (eerie music) - [Man] Holt, ye sinner! - Damn, the Roller Patrol. - [Officer] Last warning. Stop, or I'll shoot! (gunshot booming) On they skates, it's only a flesh wound. Your weapon, let me have it. - [Woman] Yes, sir, deputy. Here it is. (ominous music) (woman laughing) - [Officer] My, you're a spunky one. (officer laughing) (ominous music) Don't go away, come back. - [Woman] Whoa. (officer laughing) - Harlot of hate, the Sisters of CORB will give thee a bath in holy water. - Oh. - And I'd like to watch. (officer groaning) - [Woman] Damn recycled Saticoy batteries. (ominous music) (man laughing) - More, more, more! (man laughing) More! - Which blue bird will win the test? Run, run, run, run! Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun! (ominous music) - The trader is dead as you wished and there's one last member of the Roller Patrol. Now where's my fee? - Not so fast, Hunter. I have another job for you. (Saticoy laughing) - Reward time first, give me the batteries you promised me. - You shall have the batteries and everything else. Just obey my command. - So what do I do? - [Saticoy] A mission, a holy mission. - What? - Tell me, dearest, who has the strongest power source in the world? Hmm? - [Hunter] The CORB. You don't mean steal from the CORB. - Go to their mission, join the Cosmic Order. Locate the source of their energy and bring it me. Then I will share my kingdom with you. - What about the Marshal and his Roller Patrol? - Don't worry, I have a plan for that too. Now get moving! (Saticoy laughing) Choose your brain or use your ass! (Saticoy laughing) But bring back the crystal! You get choice of parts anyway. It's gonna be fun watching this. Oooh. - Slime bucket. (exciting synthesizer beat music) - Get naked or this one dies! (demon growling) Looky, looky. Holy Rollers come back bashful? - Rip their clothes off! Her! Her! Rip it! Rip it! - This one's mine! All mine! (exciting synthesizer beat music) - Not so holy, not so brave! These blue birds soon be in their grave! (men laughing) (woman yelping) Push her head down. (knife swishing) - Mother Speed! Mother Speed! Mother Speed, the outpost reports three sisters have been taken by Saticoy's devils. What now shall we do? - Calm thyself, sisters. Remember... to use blows that do not injure. To only stun thy opponent. Let it be known, the Cosmic Order of Roller Blade is the only force on Earth where all weapons and battle techniques are converted into tools of love. Sister Sharon, take command. Sisters, prepare the holy army for combat and skate at once to the rescue. (lively tempo music) - [Demon] Cut them hard and they will see, they will scream, one, two, three. (demons laughing) - Show your skin! Duel to the death or so your queen gets nipped! - [Demon] No, don't let her get out! - No, no! - [Demon] She's mine. Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle! - She's mine. You have them! (women whimpering) (man laughing) - [Demon] Hold her back, hold her back. Help her out. - Let them go. - Blue birds of a feather fight together, huh? (man laughing) - Watch them! Watch them! - [Demon] Watch them. - [Man] Everybody, back off! - [Demon] Watch them, watch them. - [Man] Time for gut work, cuties. (men laughing) (women whimpering) - Whoa! Yes, yes! (ominous music) (blade swishing) (man laughing) What would Mother Speed say, huh? Come here, come here! Go, let them go! (man laughing) What should we do now, Mother speeder? Down! Down! (lively tempo music) (women whimpering) Yes! Yes. - [Demon] I'll thank them real hard. - [Man] Thank heaven for blue bird! (somber music) (wind howling) (dramatic music) - [Demon] Well, well, welcome, blue birds. - Sharon! (women whimpering) - [Demon] Slice and dice them! (demon laughing) - [Man] Blue bird! Come on, blue bird! More! (dramatic music) More, more. - That heathen! - [Demon] Heathen? (men laughing) - I'll help you up. (demon grunting) - [Demon] I'll get you! No, no, no! Get off me! Ow! (knife slicing) - [Sharon] With this blade, thou shall be healed! (pleasant harp music) (woman gasping) - Sharon. Sharon. (wind howling) (exciting drum music) (men groaning) (man grunting) - [Thug] Hey, hey, let me try. (thugs laughing) (man groaning) - Perfect. (man groaning) You Spikers are pretty tough on people who can't fight back. - [Thug] What do you want here? (man groaning) - I could take you all on with both hands tied behind my back. (thug laughing) - You're screwed. - [Hunter] Here's the rope. - [Thug] Hey, you're just the kind of party we're looking for. (thugs laughing) (exciting beat music) Get her. (Hunter whimpering) - [Hunter] Come on. Come get me. (Hunter groaning) (thug laughing) - Oooh. - Good job. - [Thug] Huh? What? (thugs groaning) - Thanks. (thugs grunting) - You're welcome. (thugs groaning) (wind howling) (water sloshing) (cathedral bell ringing) (kicks thudding) (beat music distorting) (kicks thudding) - I seek sanctuary. - Sister Valjean. Sister Fargo, come quickly. - The Spikers. (pleasant harp music) (female Gregorian chanting) (Hunter groaning) Where are my skates? - They are being cleaned and anointed with oil. I will take this as an offering to Mother Speed. - What are you going to do? - Turn thy back to this instrument. (blade swishing) (pleasant harp music) - Oh. Oh. This is a miracle. - It is a way of the holy order. - I want to learn your ways. Please, will you teach me? - Thou art young and trust too easily. The corrupted one who wishes to repent. - I will be her teacher that she may cross over into the light. - She must first be tested. It is a great task with much responsibility. But I see the welcome to challenge. Let it be. I grant my blessing to proceed. She has so much trust and good spirit. My visions have shown me a new world where it will one day be easy to trust every beast. But getting there will be difficult. We reap what we sow. We learn by our mistake. Yea, verily. (man grunting) - Oh, what do we have here, man? Roller Patrol deputy with all the options. Like, wow. Hunter's done a good job, man. Oh. These are pretty. I'd take these. Wow. They fit nice. Oh, I be styling. (man laughing) (boy groaning) - Hey, Chris. Don't cry. Tears will cause they wheels to rust. Remember what I told thee about balance. There is no up or down, only thyself. Centered, squared, a prefect point in the universe. - Mm-hmm. - There is no imbalance unless though think there it. Now skate, boy, skate. (Chris groaning) Hey, don't worry. Thou will find the balance. I did. It just takes time to find it. (radio chiming) This is Marshal Goodman. - Deputy Samuel reporting, man. The Outpost called me to investigate out here the acid zone. What a mess this place is. It's all sticky and smelly. I think I'm gonna be sick. - Witness they report. - One of dead is Roller Patrol officer Matthew, man. Can't tell other body is. Look like scavengers been here, man. - Bring in the the remains for examination and proper ceremony. (cathedral bell ringing) - I see in thine eyes great passion. Yea, verily, we all need such passion. It gives us the strength to survive. But thou must learn the proper way to express it. - I've never met anyone with strength like yours. It is a power that gives me peace. (cathedral bell ringing) - After the sacred ceremony, we will truly be sisters. (cathedral bell ringing) (dog barking) (pleasant harp music) (female Gregorian chanting) (Mother Speed muttering) - I give thee a new name. Thou art... (dog gurgling) Sister Fortune. (dog growling) (knife swishing) (energy humming) And now thy weapon is converted to a tool of love. - Remember, the longer thou skate, the less thou fall. Now thou learneth. I know thou will be a good boy. It's hard for thee to stay alone while I work. I know thee liketh to go outside without thy skates. I've told thee that being outside on foot is very dangerous. Thou must stay inside until thou learneth skating. - But, Dad. - Above all, goeth not again to the Devil's playground. Honor thou father's commandment. - Oh. (Chris groaning) - Don't argue, fools. You wise guys would screw it all up. I'm sending Waco out to steal the kid. Spies say he sneaks out to the playground every day. (Saticoy laughing) Use your talk boxes. Waco gets the ball bearings when he gives you the boy. - We want the kid alive, son. (man groaning) - How come Waco gets all the good jobs? - [Thug] Hey, Indian, I've got an arrow for you. - Waco has the experience and he knows the territory. Get him, aim and shoot, and bring the kid back here. Nobody... will get... caught! - Yeah, sure. (drumming tempo music) - First I'll learn to shoot like Dad, then I'll learn to skate like Dad. (upbeat synthesizer music) Hmm. (upbeat synthesizer music) (Waco laughing) (Chris groaning) - [Waco] Hey, I got you now. Hey man, this is great. - Help! Ow. Ow. - Ah, you little twerp. (Chris whimpering) Shut up! - Ow! (thug groaning) - Wise guys, move out, I bagged the prize, man. - I give the orders, crazy man, not you. - Just bring the goodies, wise guy. - Damn crazy savage. Fool. (upbeat music) - Hey! Whoa! Come on. - Get off your butts, we've got work to do. - [Chris] Let me out of here. I'm gonna tell my dad. What're you doing? (upbeat music) - Come on. - [Chris] Let me out of here! Let me out! - Shut up. - [Chris] I'm telling my dad! My dad's the marshal, he'll get you! Let me go! - Oh, you wise guys. I'm gonna get the beer inside, you poor suckers. - Somebody help me! - I'm gonna have to put up with this kid though, but I'm good. Here's your bag, where's mine? - Give him the bearings, go ahead. - Okay, okay. - Let me go. Who are you? - [Thug] Don't worry, kid, we're just playing a game. - Mmm. Good fresh grease, man. (Chris whimpering) You wise guys. I did my job. - [Thug] Get him in, get him in there. (Chris coughing) - Okay, Indian, stand on down the road and let the pros take over. - Pros are rear entry. - I'm gonna screw you. (Waco groaning) - What did I do to deserve this? - [Thug] Oh thanks, Indian, enough ball bearings to skate forever. Let's go! - [Chris] Let me go! - Hurry! - [Chris] Stop it, ow! - Skate! (exciting tempo music) (Christ whimpering) - Ow! Ow! - Quiet, kid! - [Chris] You're sick! (exciting tempo music) Let me go, let me go! Let me go! Tell my dad! Hurting... Me. - [Saticoy] You bozos better have what I want or don't be knocking. - Your mama. - I want my daddy. - Your new daddy's inside. (Christ crying) - Let him hang. Let him dangle... till the boss works out the angle. (Saticoy laughing) (female Gregorian chanting) - All is ready to be made whole. (female Gregorian chanting) (dramatic organ music) (liquid bubbling) (heavenly music) - We must cleanse each other's souls if we are truly to be sisters. (pleasant music) (female Gregorian chanting) (liquid bubbling) (women moaning) (pleasant harp music) (pleasant foreign language music) Mother Speed senses hatred in thy heart. Remember that we use these blades to heal, not to hurt. Thou just needeth more time on the jousting grounds to cleans thy aggression. (pleasant foreign language music) Each blow is an invitation to heal. - [Hunter] Violence is a puzzle and love is the key. - [Sharon] Turn thy blade from war to peace. - [Hunter] The wounds will inflict, make evil cease. (wind howling) (smooth tempo music) (knives swishing) (exciting beat music) (spiker laughing) - Woo! (spikers muttering) - Marshal Goodman. Spikers have trespassed our holy boundary. - They'll not risk their souls for long. Come, let us go forth. - Thou cannot be defeated, Sister, unless thou want to be. (wind howling) Enough practice for today. There is healing work back at the mission. (smooth electric guitar music) Woe unto thee. - Hey! Don't I know you? - Spiker! Go in peace! - [Sharon] The good marshal will bless those sinners. Did you truly know those spikers? - They were the ones who attacked me. - Praise be thou stayed thy hand and took no vengeance. Thou art truly one of us now. (spikers groaning) - Did thee trespass our boundaries in order to seek sanctuary? - What? Never, man. - Maybe we should burn their boards and make them walk home. - Yea ye verily. Let's see how they survive without their wheels. - No, please. Forgive us our trespasses. Let us go, man. - Blabber mouth! - If you do, I'll confess a secret. - It's about one of the sisters. Woo. - Speak forth, but if thou lie, we will find thee. - Let the sisters skate forth. (pleasant music) Bless thee. Bless thee. Bless thou all. Go forth now, thy courage renewed, and skate the path of sisterhood. - Sister Sharon, what more does Mother Speed wish me to do to prove my loyalty? - The final test awaits thee. Good luck, my friend. (female Gregorian chanting) - [Nun] Mother Speed wishes thou to destroy the remains of thy worldly possessions. - Wait a minute. (door thudding) My blade. (Saticoy laughing) - I'll share my kingdom. (nun gasping) (energy humming) (electronic beeping) (alarm chiming) (Sharon gasping) (wind howling) - Why does thou betray us? (lively music) (wind howling) (foreboding music) - The sacred power crystal is gone! - Woe onto my soul, for I am to blame. Sister Fortune has backslid from the light and returned to her evil ways. What now shall I do? - Use all the skills that I have taught thee. At any cost, get back the power crystal. - I leave at once. - Halt! Skate not from this place. Word has come that little Chris has been taken. (radio buzzing) - But how could evil come onto the child? - He did tread against my orders and go to the Devil's playground, without his skates. - Heaven help us. It's the work of Dr. Saticoy. - Yea ye verily. The same evil that took my wife. - Let me help avenge thee and save the boy. - No. I must go alone to see Dr. Saticoy. Lest my son surely die. My deputy is at the guard post. No one is to come or go from this mission until my return. I have spoken. (foreboding music) (lively tempo music) (wind howling) - Years ago, Saticoy wounded me. Hatred prevented the healing of my legs. Now the marshal is blind with rage. Alone, he will surely perish. Help him, Sister Sharon, to find the boy. But above all, the crystal must be saved. It was the last great invention before the fall. With out it, mankind is doomed. The Cosmic Order or Roller Blade needs the crystal to mend the broken world. - I vow to find the crystal and help save the boy or I will die. - Thou must go with great haste. Convince the marshal to allow thee to join his crest. God speed. (lively synthesizer music) - Come in Deputy Samuel. I'm at the Devil's playground where little Chris was taken. Witness thy report. (lively synthesizer music) - This is Deputy Samuel. Someone is approaching from the south. Looks like a sister from the mission, man. - She is not to pass. Thou must send her back until all is safe. - Yes, sir. Looks like here comes trouble, Marshal. - Let me pass. - I have strict orders. No one is to leave. Don't try anything. Don't make me shoot! - Deputy let her go. Return to your post. I'll head her off at the sky bridge. - She's fast. Damn! (wind howling) (dramatic synthesizer music) - Continue to guard thy post, deputy. I have her in sight. Halt, Sister. - [Thug] Looky, looky, a blue bird in black. - Not now! - [Thug] That hurt. (dramatic synthesizer music) - I gave strict orders. No one was to leave. Thou jeopardize the life of my son. - I beg forgiveness, but if the power crystal is not returned the boy's future and hope for all mankind is lost forever. - Little Chris is my only son. I'll handle this my way. - Have faith. Your son and the crystal will both be saved this night. I promise thee. No, I wish to help thee. - We dare not provoke Dr. Saticoy. Therefore I shall lock thee away for safety. I pray little Chris is not in grave danger. (Saticoy laughing) - [Saticoy] So nice of you to drop in. Drop him. (Saticoy laughing) We got the boy and crystal, so we're gonna go to Mecca Co. Thrust away up in the sky, tell the wasteland goodbye-bye! (Saticoy singing tune) (Chris groaning) - [Chris] Daddy. - Welcome, little boy. Wanna see your daddy-o? Here's daddy-o. - I've got you now, sonny boy. No one stands in my way. Everyone must die! Rock and rule! Kill and destroy! Move it or die. I will freak out in the darkness. Everyone dies! The Sisters too! Shock the world! - That's telling him, boss. - [Big Saticoy] When Saticoy speaks, the world listens. - Saticoy? - You're mine, little boy. - [Hunter] Saticoy! - You're my prisoner now. - What's this about killing innocent sisters? - Sisters, yes, of course, we have to kill all the sisters. Kill them! Kill them all! - Oh yeah. Right. Kill all the Sisters. Eliminate the Cosmic Order of Roller Blade and then you'll share your kingdom with me. - Are you totally worthless? I've heard enough talk. Give me the crystal, do as I command! Give it to me! - Okay. Here it is. - Give me the crystal! I must have the crystal! Ah! The crystal is mine at last. What? Betrayed! Guards, stop her! Is everyone asleep? Stop her, take the crystal! (knife swishing) - [Hunter] Step aside. - Whoa, whoa, uh-uh. (thug groaning) (liquid bubbling) - Minions, wise guys, spikers, devils and guards, let the word go forth throughout the wasteland. Saticoy decrees a bounty on the hunter! Catch the trader. Bring back the crystal. - A bounty. - Will share my kingdom! Heed my words and riches will be thine! Fail me and you'll be cooked in acid stew! - Hi-ho, biasimo! Away! - As long as you are mine, no one can interfere. Soon the hunter will die, the Sisters will die, your dad will die and you, you, you will die! (Chris gasping) (eerie music) (fire crackling) (ocean waves sloshing) (female Gregorian chanting) (ocean waves sloshing) (exciting beat music) - Oh, there she is. - She got crystal! - [Thug] Let's take it from her. (thugs grunting) (exciting beat music) (thug groaning) (thug yelping) (thug moaning) - Huh. That was for Saticoy! - Bros that do not kill shall hurt! (wind howling) - I'm near the great chasm by Mecca Co. Heading now for Saticoy's headquarters. Make certain thou guard the prisoner well. - So be it, Marshal. (radio buzzing) She's locked up tight, man. Real tight. - I pray thou set me free from this prison. That I may do my holy duty. (pleasant music) (Waco groaning) - Gideon. I got a feeling my life's gonna change. Oh boy. (dog barking) Oh God. (upbeat harmonica music) Hey buddy, I could use a hand, man. I'm looking for the three guys who robbed and betrayed me, man. - You seek trouble stranger. There's a one, a two, a three unholy creatures that dare no joke. But me no so sure about you, good buddy. - Not so sure. Thanks a lot, stranger. I'll never forget. (upbeat harmonica music) Oh man. (Waco groaning) - Hey, man. - There's an intruder. - Let's get him. (Waco groaning) (Spikers laughing) - [Thug] Teach him a lesson! - [Spiker] Beat on the brat! Beat on the cat with a baseball bat! - You guys! - [Thug] Don't come in here no more. No good rotten guy! I like to hurt people. - [Spiker] Take a snack, Jack! (Spikers laughing) Take that! (Waco groaning) - What am I, a martyr? (Spiker laughing) Hey, man, if you're out there, listening somewhere up at that heaven's skate roller rink in the sky, I'm sorry, man. I'm real, real sorry. Kidnapping that little boy was the worst thing I've ever done. Well, it was one of the worst things I've ever done. I should never have hired myself out to that Dr. Saticoy. Not only is he the lowest scum-sucking pig in the whole wasteland, but he welshes on his debts. And those damn wise guys, if I had it all to do over again, I'd find those Saticoy devils and I'd kick their ass. If I just had another chance, man. Where is that holy hound dog when a guy needs him? - Gideon, what is it? Show me. Aw. (female Gregorian chanting) Bless him. (knife swishing) With this blade, though art healed so thee may join our holy battle against Dr. Saticoy. (Waco groaning) (pleasant harp music) - Yeah. Hey, hey, good looking, don't skate away! (Waco laughing) All right. (eerie music) No. Not again. - Do you want a war? (Waco groaning) You want a war? (Spikers laughing) - Not as bad as the first time, they must be getting tired. (upbeat harmonica music) (metal clanking) - You still alive? - Those were the wrong three guys. - Oh, you look for three wise guys. Skate down road to acid rink. (upbeat harmonica music) - [Waco] Stupid skillet head. (upbeat harmonica music) (sinister music) - [Big Saticoy] Soon my plan will become reality. Now to take a look through my Sat-I-scope. - [Little Saticoy] Smells like something good. - [Big Saticoy] There it is, the prize of prizes. The end of the rainbow. A paradise from another age. - Oh, it is something good! - [Big Saticoy] Mecca Co., I can see it from here. It's beautiful. - Oh. (woman heavily breathing) (Little Saticoy gasping) - [Big Saticoy] Mecca Co., a factory city, fully automated. Still grinding out energy weapons. There must be tons of them there, stacked a mile high. Enough for an army. Enough to make me Commando of Crud, King Rat and Lord of the Wastelands. (Little Saticoy laughing) - I might look small but I got big ideas. You know what I mean, pretty nookie? - Mecca Co., out of my grip but not for long. My thruster will soon be ready. - You're a genius, boss. - Of course I am, fool. And soon the world will know the genius of Dr. Saticoy. - Oooh. (Little Saticoy laughing) - Come here, you midget maggot! I want you to take a look at my plan. - [Little Saticoy] A Sat-I-scope? - You want to come with me, you'd better get with the program. - [Little Saticoy] Oooh, oooh, oooh. - I've plotted the trajectory, built the thruster and refined enough acid fuel. Soon I will have the power crystal, the one source of energy powerful enough to ignite the fuel and then the Roll Patrol and Sisterhood will be parallelized, defenseless against my hordes. No one can stand in my way! No one can prevent my shadow from obliterating the sun! No one can stop my boot from crushing good into the dirt! (Big Saticoy laughing) (Little Saticoy yelping) Up Sat-I-scope. - [Little Saticoy] Not so hard, you'll stretch my diaper. (exciting beat music) - [Waco] This is a lot of traveling, man. (exciting beat music) (Waco groaning) - [Marshal] Who are you? - I'm revenge. I've been given a second chance to chastise my enemies. - Who are thine enemies? - Dr. Saticoy and his breed. - We have the same enemies. But I must enter this hell alone. - An angel of mercy gave me a second chance... And I'm gonna use it. - Thou art a dead man on thy skates. - I'm gonna use it. - Thou can be of service. But now I go first to check the wall. Tune thy instrument to the holy frequency and await my word. - Thanks. I needed the rest anyway. (radio buzzing) (exciting beat music) - [Marshal] Waco, does thou still wish to continue? - I'm on my second wind. I'm coming in, man. (exciting beat music) (metal creaking) - Waco, I checked it out. Appears to be no guards, no traps. Skate around to the front. - Suddenly I'm feeling anointed, man. You find your boy and I'll take care of any trouble. - May Heaven's Skate bless our crusade. - Right on, man. (exciting beat music) (creature growling) (computer beeping) (upbeat harmonica music) (wind howling) - [Mother] We reap what we sow. - [Little Saticoy] I will share my kingdom with you. - [Sharon] Why doth thou betray us? - [Mother] We learn by our mistakes. - [Sharon] Why doth thou betray us? - [Mother] We learn by our mistakes. - [Little Saticoy] Kingdom with you, kingdom with you! Kingdom with you, kingdom with you! Kingdom with you, kingdom with you! (wind howling) (upbeat harmonica music) - Better go no further, Hunter. Figured you'd show up sooner or later. - Let me pass. - Ah. You not be one to take crystal to Saticoy. - Who's gonna stop me? - Me and my friends, Smith, Wesson, Colt, Luger, Winchester, Uzi, Bazooka, Uzi Special, 38 Special. Daisy Pump Gun. (hobo yelping) (lively banjo music) (hobo groaning) - Get up, Wong Ryder! - [Mother] Remember... to use blows that do not injure. (lively banjo music) (upbeat harmonica music) (wind howling) (fire crackling) - Why has thou betrayed the Cosmic Order of Roller Blade? - You don't understand, please listen. I was wrong, I'm returning the crystal. - Thou lie. She-Devil! - Deputy Samuel, come in. I'm at the Acid Rink. Everything's weird here. No sign of Little Chris. Deputy Samuel? Does thou hear me? This is Marshal Goodman. Deputy Samuel? Reply. Deputy Samuel? This is Marshal Goodman. Does thou hear me? Something eerie goeth on. Strange, the Devil may be her. (radio crackling) (Marshal groaning) Wise guys! Art thou fools. Unbind me! - Get the point? - Whoa, Marshal. Let me tell you, Dr. Saticoy has your kid strung up over a vat of Triple-Z 904. You better stay put, roller pig, or your boy will be turned into acid stew! (Marshal groaning) - [Hunter] I was wrong. - [Sharon] She-Devil! No! Now my weapon shall be used for revenge! (Marshal groaning) - Without the crystal, you're just like me. - Sinner! - I was wrong. Forgive me. - No! Now my weapon shall be used for revenge! - Do not break your sacred vow, Sharon Cross. Thou cannot be defeated unless thou want to be. - Oh. - Thou must trust me. (dramatic music) I beg forgiveness for all my sins. - Thank you, Sister Fortune. For a moment, I too was lost. (Marshal grunting) - Here we go. - The crystal is safe. Now all is forgiven. We can return. (Waco yelling) (Hunter groaning) - Find the boy, don't delay! - [Sharon] I shall find the boy. Woe that it is forbidden to heal thy sister twice. (Waco groaning) (ominous music) (crystal beeping) (Sharon gasping) (thug laughing) - Sister Sharon. - Marshal Goodman. Sister Fortune is dead and Dr. Saticoy's minion has taken the power crystal. - The evil one must be destroyed. Let us be sent into the pit and retrieve the crystal and save my son. - Soon the thruster will be ready. - I'll be the pilot. - I'm the pilot. (Waco groaning) You have to be the navigator, you little runt. - Dr. Saticoy. I got the crystal. - What? - Throw it down, you idiot! - We've got it! - We ride tonight. You and me, daddy-o, just the two of us. On the thruster! - Now what? - [Big Saticoy] Guard the boy! - Okay. - You got it straight, right? I'm the pilot, right? The pilot! - The navigator! You're the navigator! (thug groaning) - [Waco] Man. (thug groaning) (neck cracking) - Careful. All right. All right. Easy, stay there. Little Chris must be down there. I must go down to find him. Wait here. (Marshal yelping) Yeah. (exciting beat music) Waco, you still alive? Hey! (thug groaning) Waco, Waco? (exciting beat music) Spiker. (thug groaning) All right. (Waco yelling) - Come on!
