It's like you had that guitar in your hands. I could feel the strings vibrating. It was fantastic! By the way, remember to put your mom's leopard-skin coat back. She'll have kittens. What's up with you? It's that girl. She didn't say goodbye. It's not looking good. You know, when I met your mom, it didn't look good either. But now... What's that? Her number. It's not looking so bad, then. FOR GUITAR LESSONS... Shit! Stop the car! Shit! Come on, we'll never find it now. Hi, I'm not here but you can leave a message. Hello, Moira, it's... It's Rapha?I Duval. We met six or seven years ago at a guitar competition. Well, a guitar competition without guitars and... I just found your number and... If you want, you can call me on 0143549217. Rapha?I Duval. Magic Fingers. I do. Already?! Trust you! Did he say "I do"? Yes, he did. A second ago. Mr Mayor, excuse me... I hate to have to ask you this but could we backtrack a bit? Back to where my brother has to say "I do"? That suits me. I can do it better. Exceptionally, we'll redo the vows. Raph, did you see Grandpa today? We had lunch, like every Saturday. - He said he'd be here? - Yeah. Where the hell is he? Want me to go and see? I do. I declare you bound by the bonds of matrimony. Dad? It's me. Come over, please. What is this? You didn't cancel? Honey, it's already complicated enough... Robert, we can'tjust cancel. I'm very sorry about your father but... - I'm sure he'd have... - Don't think for him! You feel like partying? It's their wedding. They decide. Honey, your father's dead. It's terrible. But what can we do? It's your son's wedding. Think of him. Wrecking my wedding? Shit, Grandpa's dead! Calm down! Fine, we'll all cry tomorrow. Even so, Albert, I find you selfish. Don't tell me what I'm like. You've never looked at me! All these years and you never noticed me. No encouragement, nothing. I see you now. And I don't recognise you. Like your dad, you can't recognise your own son! My father felt I wasn't worthy of him. It's different. No. I'll never be worthy of you. Know why? Because I was dumb and rated you too highly. Want to wreck everything? Let's do it! You have a new message. Today, at 4:12 p.m. Hello. You left me a message earlier. I'm afraid you have the wrong number. There's no Moira here. SOCIAL SECURITY CARD FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25th, 1998 IF THE EARTH TURNS, YOU TURN WITH IT Sorry to disturb you. I'd like to talk to Antoine, please. Antoine? He's in bed. It's 4 a.m., goddamit! Why d'you want my son? Who are you? I'm the mother of Fleur, one of your son's friends and... What now? I woke you and you're not pleased but you can still be polite! Seen the time? - Come to bed. - Let's call the police. Sure. And why not the FBI too? To say what? Your 20-year-old daughter isn't home? She's over age. Let her live her life. Two days without a word. I'm frantic. She's pulled this one before. While she is living under this roof, she can respect us. She comes home or she calls! She was still a baby only yesterday. Some of us are trying to sleep. - Come to bed now. - Just a second. Friday, December 2nd, 1988. I had this diary for my birthday today. I mentioned it to Mum after reading Anne Frank's. She was my age. I hope my life won't be as tragic. Saturday, February 4th, 1989. What a rotten party. No one asked me to dance. I feel short and ugly. The others call me "microbe". My parents call me "little flea". Which one's smaller? Sunday, August 19th, 1990. Mathieu kissed me at last! Maybe my tongue went the wrong way. I'll ask Clara to show me. Friday, December 3rd, 1993. The first day of the rest of my life. I picked the wrong guy. I wish it had been Eric and not that clown Sacha. I think I've always loved Eric. Friday, March 25th, 1994. Eric's avoiding me. He won't talk to me. It's over, I can tell. He's met someone else. I'll never fall in love again. Never again! Sunday, April 5th, 1994. Kurt Cobain has died. The gun in his mouth, his finger on the trigger... "I don't have a gun," he sang. Like hell. Thursday, January 30th, 1995. Last night, I slept with a total stranger. We didn't speak or even swap phone numbers. Is that how to avoid suffering? Sleep with a stranger and never see him again? Friday, February 23rd, 1996. Clara came to the clinic with me. It went so fast. I only had time to ask myself... Where do they put the fetus? In the bin? Sunday, April 27th, 1997. It's a year since Al came to the house. Ever since his apocalyptic wedding. I miss him. Maybe he's right. Families are machines that eradicate feelings. Shit! Tuesday, February 10th, 1998. Mom keeps pissing me off. I want to get out of here. I feel stifled! She's such a pain. Isn't she getting enough or what? How long is it since Dad last touched her? Why're you in my room? Where were you? Call if you don't come home! Don't ever touch my things. And don't come in here again! I told you to turn left. Honey... Do you still desire me? Of course. Why? We never make love. We do. Don't we? My body disgusts you? Of course not. What a crazy idea. Stop this. What's wrong? What's wrong is I'm old and ugly. Plus you don't want me any more. Frustrated, that's it. I feel frustrated. I'll get out here. I'll take a taxi. You're in a taxi. Don't go! Your first time? My fourth. Respect... The first two times, I was too dangerous to drive. But it wasn't my fault last time. This tiny little squirrel hopped onto the road. So I braked hard. Wouldn't you? A tiny little squirrel, really tiny. Tiny, was it? The examiner said braking so hard could cause a pile-up. I should have run the squirrel down. He failed me. That's sick. Right? Yeah, it's sick. Smoke this. It eases the stress. I seem stressed? Smoke it. Wicked, huh? Dead wicked. Can I ask you something? Be honest. We won't meet again, so we can afford to be. What do you think of me, physically? Straight up? Straight up, given your age, I think you're... really hot. But... How old do you think I am? Fifty-five? Fifty-four? Fifty-three? Asshole. What? Marie-Jeanne Duval? Very good. Head back to the start. Perfect driving, no mistakes. Congratulations. Thank you. Are you crazy? Didn't you see it? Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right. It's not your fault. Rocky has always been a bit loopy. I'd taught him to use the crossing but he's so young. Only 10, almost a baby. Actually, it's different for dogs. The years aren't the same. You multiply by seven. - So Rocky was... - Is. Is. Rocky is... 10 times 7, 70. 70. He's no spring chicken. I'm 70! Sorry, I can't stay. Here, this is my number. Tell me what happens... about the dog. Goodbye. You certainly don't look your age. What keeps you looking so young? Love. Just kidding. Plastic surgery. The works. Here, here, here... When my husband first saw my new breasts, he literally pounced on them! Good, aren't they? Men want us to be 20. I told you already. Prune, we're not arguing again. What are you doing? I'll see you later. Mom... Stop it, please. Come on, tell me. Can these still turn a man on? Operate, please! Get dressed. Why? You see breasts every day. Last time I saw yours, you were breastfeeding me. It's a happy memory. What's wrong? I'm getting old. So am I. Everyone gets old. It's a mess since you and Dad fought. Fleur thinks I'm frustrated. She's not wrong. Your father never touches me. And since Raph moved back in, he's getting so much like a baby, we'll have to bottle-feed him and change his diapers soon. I wish things were different. Like before. When your father was passionate and only I counted for you. It's funny. It's always the same thing. People come here thinking I've invented a time machine. But nothing can ever be like before. Can't you do my wrinkles? Mom! Raph, you can't go on like this. It's like having a ghost around. Can't you haunt another home? You don't scare us any more. Sent your applications? Tomorrow. Ever heard of procrastination? Procra-what? Procrastination. A pathological need to put things off until the next day. You have to stop. One day, you'll have so much to do, the rest of your life won't be enough. There you go. I just got eaten by a wolf. Thanks a lot, Mom. Come here. I have a favour to ask of you. Good evening. Good evening. Isn't this a bit illegal? Let's not quibble over a 70-year-old dog. It's kind but I'd rather not. I'm not cut out to drive. A glass of champagne. Coming? When Monica Lewinsky gets out her dirty laundry, a blue dress, the White House turns pale. A stain has been found on Monica's dress. A stain made by President Clinton's sperm says the former White House trainee on a tape recorded by a friend. "I'll never wash this dress," Monica Lewinsky said. The item was delivered to Kenneth Star on Friday. It is now in the hands of the FBI's forensic teams. Hillary Clinton has made no comment. I was worried. I almost called the police. Where were you? I needed some air. They're for you. They're beautiful. Have you eaten? I stuffed myself with these. They're not bad. Pumpkin seeds. Prune brought them. You don't eat them raw, you roast them. I hope they don't sprout in my gut. If they do, they'll grow out of my ass. Sorry for earlier. That's all right. How did the test go? No squirrels this time? No squirrels. What's this? You read it? - Listen... - I'll never forgive you! I was worried... No respect. I hate you! Watch your tone with your mom! Get off my back. I'm gone. And I'll never be back. She's starting to piss me off. Where are you going? Where are you going? Come back! Mom! Help me! Call an ambulance! Mom! I'D LKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. PHILIPPE TOMORROW, I QUIT OUR FATHER FRIDAY, MAY 26th, 2000 Dad, can you drop me off? Morning! Aren't you running late? That's ok. There are classes all day. I can't give you a lift to college. I'm seeing the doctor in 20 minutes. What's wrong? Backache. You were in shape earlier. His back has 30 years in a taxi behind it. When are you going to retire? Give up the taxi. Haven't you worked enough? Enjoy life now. Soon. I'll stop soon. Come in. Have a seat. Mr Duval... Robert Duval. Just like Robert Duvall the actor? Yes. Colonel Kilgore in Apocalypse Now! Yes, but I'm Duval with one "L". "If I say it's safe to surf this beach, then it's safe to surf this beach!" "Either you surf or you fight." "Smell that? You smell that?" "Nothing in the world smells like that." "I love the smell of napalm in the morning." And Tom Hagen in The Godfather. Sorry, I'm a fan of Robert Duvall, like you are. But to get back to what brings me here... My doctor, Dr Lehman, advised me to come to see you. He told me... well, not to wait, that it was urgent. That's not good. Is it, Doctor? A specialist like you, urgently. That's never good. We'll see, Mr Duval, we'll see. Hello. 23, Rue de I'Oratoire, please. I'm on my way. Wherever you want. Are you kidding? After the night we had? Is it your first? Yes, it's my first. Do you have children? I have three. They're grown up now. Look, he's driving! That's great. Faster now. See that? - Thank you. - Goodbye. Hello, Rue Evariste Galois, please. Know who he was? Who was who? Evariste Galois. Know who he was? A mathematician. He invented an arithmetic function. Exactly. He died aged 20 in a duel. The night before, he stayed up writing theories that still stand in mathematics. He should have slept instead. Maybe he'd have won his duel then. He'd have had a lifetime for his dumb theories. Maybe. You know the way? Don't worry. Don't you ever go wrong? Take the wrong route, say? All of a sudden, you're totally lost. Alone by the road. Hoping a taxi will pass by? We don't get along. Not any more. In fact, we never got along. Know how Prune and I met? I was making too much noise. It disturbed her. That hasn't changed. That, plus my dumb job... Know what a patient wanted? A mad old bat... She wanted her bulldog's nose done. "A little snub nose like Nicole Kidman's." Dumb bitch. Dad, I feel like I've screwed up for years. So why don't you stop screwing up? Gentlemen... Loupiac-Goudillet '98. Thank you, young man. It's perfect. Actually, Ch?teau Yquem '79. - Be careful. - You only live once. At 15, I was in love with Delphine, a girl at school. One day, God knows why, I sent her some hairs. Hairs? Yes, hairs. Pubic hairs? Pubic hairs. By mail. I couldn't manage a love letter. So you sent pubes. Logical. I don't know why I did it. I think it turned me on to think she touched them or that when she opened the envelope, a hair had fallen on her bed. But that's not all. Delphine was totally traumatised by the letter. She threw it away, disgusted, saying that if it happened again, she'd tell her father who was a cop. So what I did... was create a false lead. After our gym class, while the guys were in the showers, I got some pubes from Mathias Moreau's briefs. The class whipping boy. And I sent them to Delphine. Mathias Moreau was expelled. How did they know it was him? He was a redhead. A real redhead. The only one in the school. You realise you probably screwed up his education? He probably ended up a delinquent. Or a junkie. A transsexual. A communist. A carnie. Mathias Moreau? Yes. Robert Duval. Remember me? Ch?teaubriand High. Robert Duval. Bobby! Robert Duval? He's gonna belt him. I don't remember. We were in the same class. The year of the pubic hair thing. The pubic hair... Robert Duval. Yes, I remember you now. Bobby. How about that. What brings you here? I need to talk to you. Just a second... If we were classmates, you know my wife. Delphine! Delphine? I recognised Delphine right way. I mean, we were all in love with her. And Mathias Moreau got her! I don't believe it. She thought he did it out of love and she fell for him. - Seriously? - Yes. 35 years they've been married, with four kids. Do the kids know how their parents met? Wait for me! Where are you going? Dad! What the hell's he doing? Shit! My Berlutis... I found a bottle from the year I was born. That's kind of old. It might be vinegar now. Aren't we witty? This one's a goody. Not bad. Haut Brion 1945. Not bad? One of the world's top ten wines and you down it in one, eating p?t?. Bravo. Very classy! Very original. Dad, this is for you. Thank you. It's not much but... It's pretty. What is it? A tiny little anorak. No! It's to put behind your back when you drive. I heard it works really well. Cut it out. It's a great idea. I want one. All US taxi drivers have one. If the taxi drivers have adopted it... Thank you, kiddo. By the way, I'm getting an apartment. You'll be alone here at last. Alone here... We'll see. Can this wait until tomorrow? I'd offer you a share but Eric's squatting on my couch for now. How's Homo erectus? I haven't seen him in ages. Not so good. Caroline threw him out. He wanted a kid. She got a lover. When do we get grandkids? Isn't it about time? Didn't anyone tell you? What? We're skipping a generation. Don'tjoke about that. A family's important, you know. Watching you three grow is the best thing I've ever seen. Having kids... is a wonderful experience. I've drunk too much. What are you doing? Trying out Fleur's present. Can't it wait? Come inside now. When I was a kid, my pals and I used to play... in the woods near my grandparents'. There was a ditch. A huge one. We wanted to jump over it. "You're not up to it," we'd say, taunting each other. But no one ever dared to jump over the death ditch. That's what we called it. When you're a kid, you say things like the death leap, the death gully, the death dive... Why are you telling me this, honey? Because I went back to the death ditch today. To try to cross it. You know what? When I got there, it was the same ditch. Exactly the same one, still as deep, still as impressive. I still couldn'tjump. I wasn't up to it. I quit smoking today. Yeah, sure. No, for good. I love you. I have to tell you something. 4 MONTHS LATER Mom? All right. Hi, Eric and Fleur. Leave us a message. Sweetheart, it's Mom. Call me back, please. Mom? ROBERT JEAN DUVAL DATE OF DEATH: SEPTEMBER 3rd...
