Thank you. Is this your bag? Yeah. Is there a problem? -Can you open it? -Of course. Same for the other boxes? Yes. I do Japanese ink painting. TIME FOLDS TIME FOLDS TIME FOLDS TIME'S ARROW CHAPTER 1: TIME FOLDS CHAPTER 1: TIME FOLDS Mr. David? I've been hoping to meet you for so long. This is my book. You sent it to me four years ago. Do you remember? I hadn't finished writing it. It was just a draft. You sent me my book that hadn't been published yet. You don't remember? I don't know what you're talking about. But I'm here because you asked me here. When you found out I was coming for the science convention, we decided to meet there to make an attempt. An attempt at what? To enter the timeline. To time travel. There are gaps in your memories -- in your memory. Right? Yeah. You can access them. TIME'S ARROW CHAPTER 1: TIME FOLDS TO OUR INDISPENSABLE... You send me the proof that the theory of time travel was valid. This painting is very old. Why do you have it? It's an order from Japan. This style of ink painting is my specialty. It's good. Do you know what these paintings are talking about? Something about a Samurai from the 12th century. Exactly. It's the legend of a warrior, Naosane Kumagai, who, after killing a young man, was so wracked by guilt that he became a Buddhist monk. Ring any bells? No. You don't understand. You send me this book that I hadn't written yet because you wanted to change certain things from the past. What did I want to change? Do you know what time's arrow is? We perceive time as a straight line, a series of causes and effects. But in reality, the basic equations of physics don't change when reversed. We believe that time is continuous, that it's solid, if you will. But that's true. Time is as flexible as a leaf. In theory, we can see our past and our future. In theory, all it takes is to change a cause or an effect to see the result, by bending time around ourselves. In theory, then, it is possible to arrive anywhere in the timeline. And it's just as possible to jump down the line and change events. At least, for you it is. For me? As far as I know, no one else has done it. And... How do I do it? You just need to concentrate deeply. Can we try? What is it? Risperdal. 50 mg. It will help you relax. Think about a specific moment. Visualize every detail. Then, try to conjure the most complete picture of what you're experiencing. Focus your entire being on this mental picture. Don't lose it. Visualize every last detail. Do you sense where your body and mind are at that exact moment? I'm Valerie. David. OK. Your work is nice. It's... You like it? A lot. Do you know origami at all? It's... It's a fascinating art form. It's true. It's... It's so simple, and yet... Super complex. Yeah. Yeah. You can make anything with just a sheet of paper. Yeah. I know the... The crane shape? Yeah. It's the most defining shape, in origami anyway. There's even a Japanese legend... That says that whoever folds a paper crane, their wish will be granted. Yeah. Here. Can I keep it? Of course. It's for you. Thank you. So, you invited one of my friends, hoping I'd come with him. OK... Who told you that? You're going to tell me, tomorrow night. We'll be on the roof of a building next to yours. That's where we'll make love for the first time. In three months, we'll get married, on a whim. After you finish school, we'll buy a house in the country. Good. Lift your leg up. You'll become a professional photographer. I become an art restorer. I don't understand. Why are you telling me this? Calm down. Catch your breath. What happened? Nothing. You didn't move. You sat down and opened your eyes. How much time has passed? Five minutes. That's the same amount of time I spent with her. What did you do? I... I saw Valerie, the first time we met. Let's do it again. My father. What are you doing here? What's wrong? Things haven't been easy recently, you know. I'm here, Dad. Don't worry. You're fine. What are you doing here? Can you speak to Dr. Duval? My father. My father's going to get sick. Wait. Where were you? At the hospital. I was visiting my father. I don't understand. I want to see him again. Let's go again. I think you might need to rest up a little. No. I'm going back. You invited one of my friends hoping I'd come. -Right? -OK... Who told you that? You. You're going to tell me. Tomorrow night, we'll be on the roof of a building next to yours. We'll make love there for the first time. What are you saying? In 3 months, we'll get married. We're going to have a daughter. I'll want to name her Alice. But you'll have your way: Florence. Not. Alice. Florence! Relax, big guy. Calm down. I don't want this to end up like last time. You never told me whether... Whether you saw Dr. Duval. Who is Dr. Duval? I'm going to go. Where? But I'll come back. Don't worry. Whatever happens, I'll always be here. I'll be here to help you. Let me go! OK. That's enough. Take off his pants. No. You don't understand. You're making a mistake. Calm down, Mr. David. I'm calm. Come in. Hello, David. How are you today? Do you remember me? Have a seat. Forgive the mess. You look better. Can we talk? I wanted to talk to you about the timeline. It's hard to explain. I can't remember everything. I can't remember everything. How does it all work, generally? Today, I'm here, and... Tomorrow, I don't know. I could be five years ago, or... In ten years, or here. Time is relative. You don't believe me. I'm not here to judge you, David. I'm here to try to understand what's happening to you. I want to understand with you. But if you refuse to talk, it'll be hard to help you. Do you have a technique? Is it just you? There's a... A Japanese man. A scientist. He told me what I could do. I did it before I met him. What, exactly? What did you do before you met him? I brought him a book, the book he hadn't finished writing. OK. And this Japanese man... You met him in Tokyo? No. I don't think so. Because you're returning from a trip to Japan. Why did this old Japanese man tell you how to do it? Why you? Are you all right? Yeah. Mr. David, I know why you travel in time. What? I know why you time travel. Why? Think about what the painting says. The warrior? Kumagi? Yes. Kumagi is so haunted by his remorse that... I don't understand. You're trying to find your daughter. You want to save her. My daughter? Save her from what? It's time, Flo. Let's go. CHILDCARE There was an accident on the 10 this morning that has caused some traffic at the toll. Drivers will need to be patient. There's not many ways to get around it. Things are slow on the south side this morning. Open it. We need an ambulance. We're at P3. We're in the outdoor lot, P3. We found the girl. She's in the car. Parking lot P3. We need an ambulance now! A little girl. 3 or 4 years old. No signs of life. We did CPR. I don't have a pulse. What are you doing? Hello? Mr. Marceau, can you hear me? Mr. Marceau? I know why I'm here. Yes. You had an attack, Mr. Marceau. We had to calm you down. No. No. I know why I'm in the hospital. I left my daughter in the car, right? Yes. Is she dead? Yes. I'm sorry. EXIT EXIT Unconscious patient, shower! Why? OK. OK. Mr. Marceau, understand that your son has intense PTSD. He has lost contact with reality. But... How long might it take for him to come back to normal life? If all goes well, it could work itself out, but everyone's different. How long will he have to be on medication? Mrs. Vasco and I will evaluate that. I'll see him every two weeks. Perhaps more, if necessary. What's important for you to do right now is that if you think David is showing any signs of too much emotion, or suicidal thoughts, any personal hygiene problems, then you need to call me right away. Make sure he takes his medication. -OK? -OK. Yes? Come in. Hi. Hey, big guy. Ready to go? Yeah. -Hello, David -Mrs. Vasco. We've met before. David, you're free to do what you want. We encourage you to take up your former activities again, but you're going to need to stay at your father's house every night. We talked about it. I'm OK with that. Good. We'll start meeting next week. Here's my info. You can always reach me. Don't hesitate to call. And here's your prescription. Risperdal... It'll help you relax. Don't stop taking it. Very important. David? There's also, of course, the anxiety medication, and the antidepressants. There. What are you going to do? Maybe... Maybe go to the studio. Hello? Dad, where's the Japanese painting that was in my studio? Japanese painting... The one that was on the easel. I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. OK. Never mind. Who knows? Maybe this conversation has already taken place ten times. Hey. Just in time to help me take this off. Grab your side. I was happy to see you get out of the hospital. As soon as you feel better, you'll be back on your feet. Huh? Leave. Go far. Take a trip around the world. Get outta here. I can give you the money. OK? So you can go see something else. You always loved to travel. It's true. You always did. No. -Why? -Because... -I can't take your retirement money. -My retirement! It's fine. I'm your father. A father's supposed to think about his kids. I'm so sorry. I misspoke. I'm going to get a coffee. APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE She already signed? The terms are standard. Your life won't change, except that you won't have the right to communicate with your ex-wife. It's the court ruling. You can take a few days to think it over if you want to have anything changed. I'm not an artist. The real challenge is scientific. You know your art history. You know the different pigments. David? Since no two paintings are alike, the challenge is to find solutions through chemistry. My studio is kind of like a lab. I'd like to see it. I'm intrigued. You'll come. Have you started again? Not really. Not yet. I can't. I understand. I don't think you do. No one can understand. I can imagine. Are you getting used to the medication? Do you feel less tired? It's entirely possible to jump along the timeline and change events. At least, for you it is. You have gaps in your memories, in your memory. Right? CHAPTER 1: TIME FOLDS Time is flexible, like a leaf. All you have to do is deeply concentrate. All you have to do is deeply concentrate. Hey! What are you doing? What do you do all day in the studio? Do you see anyone? You need to see people. You need to get back into... Enjoying life. It's not something you can just choose to do. It happens or not. You could try. I don't want you to worry about me any more. About how I feel, or whether I'm enjoying life. It's not going to happen yet. OK. Maybe we just need to adjust your medication. Stop! Cut it out with that! Let's go. OK. -Hello. -Hello, David. Doctor. Come in. Is this a bad time? No. You seem better. Yeah, seems that way. I couldn't wait to see this. It's small. If I worked in a national gallery, I'd have more tools. How are you feeling? Nothing new. Do you spend your days in here alone? Yeah. I go out and go for walks. I go to the park, and... What do you think about all day? To be honest, I try not to think too much. Have you started working again? Not really. I pass the time. -Do you want a glass of water? -Yes, thanks. Thanks. I knew I would find you here. I've been expecting you, Mr. David. Do you understand, now? Everything is still possible. Can I ask you something? Of course. How did we meet? You called me. You don't remember our conversations? Try to remember, Mr. David. Do you really think it's possible to save her? Of course. You have the power to fold time. Then let's start over. Tonight. Val? Listen to me for a minute. Then I'll leave. I promise. -I don't know... -You should go. -I can bring Florence back. -Stop it, David. Stop it. I'm calling your father. No. Please... Please... Think about it. If I do it... I need you to believe me. Valerie... Look, David. What happened is hard for everyone. OK? For everyone. I'm going to bring her back to you. Why did you come here? Don't touch me. I'll bring her back. Go away! Go away! Hello? -Paul? -Yeah, it's me. It's Valerie. Hi, Valerie. I just saw David. He came to see me. I told him to leave. He did, but I don't want him coming back again. OK. I let myself in. The door was open. Are you ready? I didn't feel anything. That's normal. You're used to it now. Mr. David, I've been hoping to meet you for a long time. This is my book. Do you remember? Wait. So I traveled through time to give you an unwritten book. Exactly. And I did that to prove to you that time travel is real, and to help myself do what I'd already done, because I had already folded time to give you the book. As I explained already, you sent me this book I hadn't written yet because you wanted to change certain events in the past. That means you knew my daughter was going to die. You could have warned me. You didn't do a thing! Why? -It was the only way. -The only way to what? To prove my theories! You let me daughter die to prove your theories? You've reached David Marceau. Leave a message. Thanks. David, pick up. David, I'd like to talk to you. I'm near your studio. I'd love to see you. Think about a specific moment. Visualize every last detail. I know you went to see Valerie to talk to her. Try to conjure the most complete image you can of what you're experiencing. Pick up, big guy. Focus your entire being on that mental image. I'm sorry, son. I'm really sorry. Mr. David. David? It's open. My baby... Subtitling: Hiventy
