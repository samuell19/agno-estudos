[ gunshot ] - [ laughs ] Boy, you sure are good. - [ gunshot ] - [ Steve laughs ] - Doggone it! [ gunshot ] Boy, look at that! Knocked one off at three paces. - Say, why didn't you knock it off with the muzzle of your gun? - Oh, that wouldn't be fair. You're kidding, ain't ya? - No, I'm not. And I'll tell you what I'll do. You hit one at eight paces and you get your breakfast. - Get my breakfast? It's a go. Eight paces. Hot dang. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Ha ha! Ah, ♪ Don't you ever be a cowboy ♪ - [ gunshot ] - [ Steve laughs ] [ gunfire ] [ shooting continues ] - Hear that, Steve? - Yeah. - An echo. [ gunshots ] Say, that echo st-st-stutters. - [ laughs ] - That's no echo. Somebody's shooting. - Oh, I knew that all the time. Ain't no law again' it, is there? - No, I guess not. [ shooting continues ] - Get that strongbox out of there, Blinky! [ gunshot ] - Hyah! Hyah! [ gunshot ] - Hyah! Hyah! - Clem, it's a runaway! - Yeah. - Here, hold this. - Hey! Oh! Hot-hot-hot! Somebody take this! Oh! Hey, wait for me! Wait for me! Ah! Ow! Oh, oh! [ sighs ] - Whoa! Nice boy. Miss? Miss? Come out of it! - You! - Howdy, ma'am. Kind of frightened, weren't you? - Well, you should know. What are you going to do now? - Well, I guess I better get you and this wounded man into Cottonwood. - Why, you wouldn't dare show up in town! - What do you mean? I-- - Here, boy! Hey. Why didn't you wait for me? I could've helped. Oh, good morning, ma'am. She say what happened? - Well, she doesn't quite make sense. I guess the excitement was too much for her. - Good looker, too. - Oh, never mind that. Ma'am, maybe you'd like to ride up top with me. - I prefer to remain where I am. - Come on. [ clicks tongue ] Pack up the things at camp. Meet you in town. Hyah! Hyah! [ whistles ] - Well, here it is, Bill. - Well, good work, boys. Get it inside. - Why, it's the railroad payroll. - Not a bad haul, eh? [ chuckles ] Those fellas would save themselves a lot of trouble if they sent their money directly to us. - Yeah. Why don't you just send 'em our address? [ all laugh ] - Where did you get those clothes? - I picked 'em up in Redwood. Why? - They stick out on you like a sore thumb. I want you to change them. And another thing-- I see you've been riding that new paint horse. - Well, I just wanted to try her out. - You'd be spotted a mile away on that mare. I don't want you to take her out again. Is that understood? - All right, Bill. - Come on, boys, let's divide. - Wake up, Dad. The stage is about due. - I wasn't asleep, Molly. I was just thinking. - So I noticed. Will you help me with that mail sack? - Sure. Where is it? - Right over there. - Man: Here comes the stage! And it's sure in a hurry! This is one time the stage got through. - Hyah! Hyah! - Something's happened, Dad. There's a stranger driving. - Wait a minute! Whoa! Whoa! - What happened here? Where's the driver? - I don't know, Sheriff. There's a wounded man inside and a lady that could stand a little cheering up. - It's Ezra Simpson. He's badly hurt. A couple of you boys get him into the office. - Are you all right, miss? - I think so. - How did you get in on this? - There was a holdup and the team ran away. I happened along and managed to stop 'em. - Where did this happen, son? - Oh, a couple of miles up the road. - There's the leader of the highwaymen! - What? - She says he's one of the bandits. - Well, she's dead wrong, Sheriff. - So you stopped the runaway, huh? - That's right. - Are you sure he's the one? - Positive. He's wearing the same clothes and he's riding the same horse. - That's my horse, all right, Sheriff. But she doesn't know what she's talking about. All you've got is her word against mine. - I'll take hers. And to me, that spells just one thing: lockup. - Turn him over to us, Sheriff. We'll take care of him. - Now hold on, boys. He's my prisoner and it's my job to lock him up. Of course, once he's inside, my duty's done. - We get what you mean. Come on, boys. - How is he, Dad? - He'll pull through all right. Thanks, fellas. - What are you doing in this part of the country? - I came to visit my father. - Your father? In Cottonwood? - Yes. You probably know him. His name is Kincaid. - Bill Kincaid? - Yes, the banker, you know. - The banker? Oh. Oh, yes, I know him. - Well, I haven't seen him since I was three years old when my mother died. Do you know where I could find him? - Molly, bring me a pan of hot water. - Well, just as soon as we get things straightened out here, I'll take you to him. - Thank you. - Howdy, Sheriff. - Howdy. - Say, I'm looking for the hero of Cottonwood. - You're looking for who? - The hero of Cottonwood, my buddy. He just drove that stage into town. - Oh, is he your partner? - He sure is. Me and him's just like that. - Well, he's right across the street. The hotel's full, so I rented him a room. - Well, that's mighty nice of you, Sheriff. Maybe you could do the same for me. - Sure. Come on over. - Well, sir. Boy, am I getting service. I ride into town, meet the sheriff, and right away he wants to give me a room. This town sure is hospita-- hospita-- sure is friendly, ain't it? - I can see you're gonna spend a lot of time in this town, buddy. - You think so? - Make yourselves at home, boys. - Thanks, Sheriff. Nice place. All screened in. Keep the flies out. Ha! Well, Steve, how's it feel to be a hero? - A hero? They think we held up the stagecoach. - That's fine-- they what? - You're gonna be all right. The lead went clean on through. No probing. - Sure knocked me out for a while. Lucky you didn't get hurt, miss. - I hope you'll feel well soon. - He will. He's a tough old monkey. You can thank this young lady, Ezra, that the outlaw who done it is behind bars. - You helped the community, miss, in identifying him. [ saloon piano playing ] - Murph. Take over. - All right. I thought I told you to stay at the shack. - We heard someone was picked up for the robbery. - Oh, that's nothing to worry about. Just some cowboy came along at the wrong time. - That sort of covers us, huh? - Unless he can prove he's innocent. - Well, maybe we ought to make sure he doesn't get a chance to prove anything. - Then there's only one thing to do-- teach him a lesson! - That's right, Frank! Get him outta there! [ all shouting ] - Bring him out! - Get him out, Frank! Get him outta there! [ shouting continues ] - What did you do with that money? - I didn't take it, I tell you. - He's tellin' the truth! Say, one of you fellas untie us, will ya? - We'll make him talk. - All right, bring him on up here! - Let's go. Come on. - What are they going to do? - We don't waste time on killers. - I see. [ shouting continues ] - Get him on here. Get up in that tree and tie this rope on. - Wait a minute. Is that the horse you identified? - Yes. - Oh, there's something wrong. The bandit that shot me didn't ride that horse. - Are you sure, Ezra? - Oh, I take my oath on it. This horse got a lot of silver trimmings. Bandit's horse was bigger. Besides, the animal I saw was a mare. - Are you gonna tell us where you hid that money? - I told you a hundred times, you've got the wrong man. - Come on, you're wastin' time! - Well, let him waste it. It's his time, ain't it? - Hurry up with that rope! - These men didn't hold up the coach! They had nothing to do with it! - Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Hurry up with them ropes up there! - Well, I've got Ezra Simpson's word for it. He says this horse belongs to him. And it's not the horse the bandit rode. - Hurray! We're saved! [ buzzing ] Bees! - [ all shouting ] - Bees! Help! Help! They sting! Get me outta here! Somebody get this thing off me! This hurts! My hands are tied! Help! Get these bees! Hornets! Moths! Ohh! Help! Aw, somebody get this thing off! Oh, please! Where is everybody? I can't see! My eyes are-- Help, I'm stung! Oh! Oh, somebody... [ whimpering ] Hornets. Oh! Get me--get me outta here, somebody! I can't-- [ yelling ] Oh! Oh! Oh, my. Save me, save me! Help me! Help me! [ groaning ] [ yells ] [ groaning ] Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute, Molly. Give a fella a chance to catch his breath, will ya? - [ chuckles ] Let me take care of him, Molly. - All right, Nina, I'll take you to your father. - Oh, my, my, my. - Now... - Oh, here you come. - Ha ha. - Let's see now. - Oh, just a minute, Steve.

Tex, will you take over? I think we can talk over here, Nina. - I've looked forward to seeing you, Dad. - Well, I'm afraid that I've been rather a neglectful father. - Well, everything's going to be different from now on. We're together and I want to make a home for you. - Well, that's--that's very, very sweet of you, Nina, but, after all, I must live close to my place of business. However, I'll make arrangements for you to live with some nice family while you're here in Cottonwood. Hiya, Braddock. Hello, boys. - Hello, boss. What's the idea of meetin' out here? - I didn't want to talk to you in town. - Is it about your daughter? - Yes. As a matter of fact, she isn't really my daughter. Nina was two years old when I married her mother. I never told her anything different. - Well, I don't like the idea of a woman hangin' around. They get too curious. Besides, we're doin' all right. - We'll do better. She won't be in our way. I've made arrangements for her to live with Molly Denton. - Say, she'll be in a swell spot to tip us off to the gold shipments. - You catch on quick, don't you? - [ clears throat ] - If my father had expected me, I'm sure he'd have had a home ready. - Well, you know you're always welcome with us, Nina. - Thank you. - We like it here, too. Too bad we have to shove off. - Leaving? - Yep. We're leaving in the morning.

Dad must have taken it. - Well, here's a consignment of gold for Redwood City. Quite an amount, too. Brought in by Simpson. - That's just what happened. He didn't want to disappoint an old customer like Ezra Simpson, so he's taking it through himself. - Come on, Clem. He might need some help. - Huh? - He's well on his way by now, but you boys might ride out in the morning and help him bring the stage in.

Well, if you folks will pardon me, I'll say good night. - Good night. - Good night. - There's one thing sure, Clem. Ben never got to Redwood City. I can't understand it. - Maybe he lost his way. - Oh, that couldn't be. He's made the trip too many times. - Well, all we can do is keep on lookin'. - Maybe you're right. - There it is. - Well, they got him. It's gonna be kinda tough breakin' this to Molly. I'm sorry, Molly. I had no idea your father tried to drive through alone. - Guess you didn't know him very well. The stagecoach line was his life. - Molly, he wanted to give us the job. Well, if you feel the same way about it, you got yourself a couple of men. - Thanks, Steve. I knew I could depend on you. - Oh, there's nothin' to it, Miss Molly. I'd like to see some of them bandits try to stop us. - Well, I'll run along. Gotta get back to the store. - Where is your store, Mr. Simpson? - Down past the saloon. - Down past the saloon?

Snap out of it! - What's the idea of letting 'em go? - Don't worry. We'll take care of them. Come on. - And there's a big gold shipment in Redwood City to be brought back. - Oh, we can handle it, all right. - I'll say we can. With old Betsy here, bring on your bandits. Do you think they'll try to hold us up? - It won't be worthwhile this trip. But on the way back, we'll be prepared for 'em. - Got something up your sleeve? - Yep, and I think it'll work. - Hyah! Hyah! - Goodbye! - Hello, Nina. - Hello, Dad. Steve just left with the stagecoach. I hope nothing happens to him. - Oh, I don't think there's anything to worry about. They're probably carrying nothing of value. - Oh, no, he isn't. But on the return trip, he's carrying a shipment of gold. - Oh, I see. Well, Steve can probably take care of himself. Well, I'll be going along. I'll see you later. - Goodbye, Dad. - Goodbye. Relax, boys, they're traveling light. The kid tells me they're picking up a load of yellow at Redwood City. - Very interesting. - Yeah. What are we waiting for? - Well, there's plenty of time. We can get them on their way back. - Kinda handy having a daughter, eh, Kincaid? - [ chuckles ] You said it. [ metal clanging ] - Whoa, boys! - Howdy! - Hello there. - You're the new driver, eh? - That's right, and I got a little job for you. - Good. We'll get right at it. - I still don't catch on. Oh, I see. You're gonna make a battleship out of it. - That's just about right. I want you to put a couple of thicknesses on the back. And be sure you put hinges on the sides so we can close ourselves in if necessary. Oh, and by the way, could you tell me where I can get a couple of good gunmen that can shoot straight? - Sure. - Now that we're all set, I want you men to get your rifles and be back here in an hour. I'll pick up the gold and ammunition. And just one more thing. I want you men to wear women's clothes. - You want what? - You heard what the man said. He wants you to wear women's clothes. I don't want any backtalk either. Get going. - Say, Clem, how would you look in a dress? - Oh, fine. - Well, that's good. I want you to get out and round yourself up one and get right in the middle of it. - Right in the middle of it. Who me? - Yes, you. [ chuckles ] - Now wait a minute. I didn't know what I was talking about. - All right, fellas. Get inside. Let her go, Steve! - All right, boys. Here we go! Hyah! [ laughing ] - Say, the stage is coming, but it's full of women. - It just makes it that much easier. [ gunshots ] - Here they come! Get in it, boys! - Yah! Hah! [ shooting continues ] - Hyah! Yah! Hyah! Yah! Yah! Giddup! Hah! Hah! Come on! Yah! Yah! Yah! Hyah! Come on! - Can't follow them any farther! They're almost in town! - I could have sworn I hit that stage a dozen times! - Come on! Yah! Yah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Have any trouble, Steve? - Oh, not much. This is one time the shipment of gold got through. - Well, where's Clem? - Inside. [ all laughing ] - If you think I look funny, wait till you see what's inside. All right, girls, this is far as we go. [ chuckles ] [ crowd laughs ] - Hiya, baby. What are you doin' tonight? - Oh! - Somebody tried to hold us up, but Steve's idea sure worked. Heh heh, bulletproof. - Well, that's very clever. - Well, it sure helped. - Oh, Clem? - Yeah? - You dropped something. [ laughter ] - We got pretty well shot up. - Oh, we didn't have a chance. - He's smarter than I thought. - Howdy, fellas. - Howdy. - Hello. - Say, isn't that Higgins? - Yes. He's been prospecting for about a year. Looks happy, too. And he's on his way to the Express office. - I want 'em sent to the bank in Redwood City. - It'll go out on the morning stage. - Good. - If Higgins is sending that gold to Redwood City, we oughta knock it off. - Uh-uh. I'm not taking any more chances with that coach. - But Kincaid's got an idea, and it ain't bad. - Yeah? - You see that cannon over there? - Glad to have seen you again, miss. Gotta go back now and catch up with my thirst. - Take it easy, Mr. Higgins. - I'm sure glad we got that gallopin' boiler. - We'll make up for lost time, my dear. And don't forget we have a date to go riding tomorrow at 11:00. - I won't. Good night, Dad. - Good night, Nina. - Hello, Nina. - I just had a lovely visit with Dad. - Why didn't you ask him in? - Well, he had to get back to his work. - Oh, I see. - Well, as he explains it, gambling is a necessary evil. It gives the boys something to do. - We understand, Nina. - Say, where do you think I've been? [ chuckling ] I've been out with the sheriff trying to catch a thief. - A thief? - Uh-huh. - Well, what'd he steal? - A cannon. [ chuckles ] You know, the one across the street? - A cannon? Say, that's a funny thing to steal. Molly, I can't get that cannon out of my mind. - You think it has something to do with us? - I'm afraid so. We outsmarted 'em once. But a couple of blasts from that thing, it'll be goodbye, stagecoach, iron plate and all. - That's why it was stolen! Steve, I've got an idea! Nina, we're going on a picnic. - Well, good. I'll pack a basket. - It'll be filled with Higgins' gold. - I don't understand. - Well, Steve thinks there's going to be trouble getting the coach through. So you and I will get ourselves a farm wagon and say we're going on a picnic. Steve will go on his merry way with the coach and nobody will bother us. - Well, that sounds exciting. - Well, I'm afraid it'll be rather tame, but the ride will do us good. I'll get everything ready. - All right. May I speak with you a minute, Dad? - Surely. Be right back, boys. - I hope you don't mind my breaking our date. - Something wrong? - Oh, no. Molly and I are going on a picnic. - A picnic? - Well, to be truthful with you, it isn't really a picnic, but-- - Well, aren't you kinda mixed up? First you say it's a picnic, then you say it isn't. Now what is it? - I guess there's no harm in letting you in on the secret. - Why, of course not. What is it? - Well, you see, Dad, Molly and I are planning on... - Well, we got the cannon placed and Blinky's all set to let 'em have it. - The gold isn't on the coach. Get word to the boys to lay off. - Well, what's wrong? - Nothing. You fellas are going on a picnic. - A picnic? - Whoa! - Hold it. You two girls do what you're told, and you won't get hurt. All right, Bill, get it outta here. - Hah! Hyah! - Dad! Dad, these men held us up! Make them leave us alone! - Did you get the Higgins gold? - Yeah. - Dad! - Don't waste your breath. He's not your father. - And thanks for tipping us off. - Stand back, all of you! You're worse than I thought. And that was bad enough. - I'm sorry for your sake you know the setup, Molly. - Wait a minute. - Whoa! You didn't tell anybody the girls were takin' the wagon, did you? - 'Course not! - Well, if we were going to be held up, it would've happened long before now. - Say, that's right. - We're turning back. [ clicks tongue ] Giddup! Hah! Hah, boys! Hah! Whoa! - They held us up, Steve! Kincaid's holding Nina. And he isn't her father! His men are after me now! - Get outta here, hyah! - Go on! - [ whistles ] - Where's Nina? - In a shack a couple of miles down the road! - Get in the coach. - Here they come! [ continues shooting ] - We got 'em, boys! Come on! Get their guns, boys. - Now you get up in that wagon and you stay there. You hear? Hyah! Hyah! [ whistles ] Come on! - Whoa! Whoa! - I'm sorry, Steve, I caused you so much trouble. Will you forgive me? - Why, certainly, Nina. - Well, anyway, you did the sheriff a good turn. - I'm the best stagecoach driver you ever had, Molly. Thanks for the job. - I don't think you'll have any trouble, Clem. - Not a chance. Take good care of the Express office, Molly. - Well, that's Steve's job. - Good luck! - Here I go! Hyah! Hah! Somebody get this road outta my face! Whoa! Whoa, I tell ya! Ah!
