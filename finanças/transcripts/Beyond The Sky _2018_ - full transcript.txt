Subtitles by explosiveskull My name is Chris Norton. And I'm a documentary filmmaker. I shot my first film, if you can call it that, on my 7th birthday. Stop it! Shut up! And you go and watch some TV. Go to your room. I remember it well 'cause it was my birthday. I said, "Watch some TV"! Hey, Nell! Come back. Stop what you're doing. Nell, come back! Ah, very nice. Nell! Nell! Hey, Nell! Chris. Go on, keep back. It was just a power surge. But it was enough for my father to take the act of a desperate woman and turn it into another of his obsessions. That night, he became convinced that my mother was abducted by aliens. My father died two weeks ago... ...never giving up on that belief. So I decided to make this film. To disprove one of the greatest myths of this century. The one that destroyed my family. The alien abduction phenomenon. Meet Kyle, our grip and local guide. Hey, hey. How it's going? - How you doing? - Good. - Kyle Blackburn. - Chris Norman. Yeah, nice to meet you. I'm Brent. The convention's over here. - Bill, this is Chris Norton. - Chris. - Hey. - Bill Johnson. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, great to meet you. - This is Brent. - Oh, hey, there, Brent. Welcome to the International UFO Congress. Have you ever been to this conference before? I don't believe so. Well, then let me show you around. - Right. - You okay there, Brent? - Get my good side. - He's just gonna be - following us. Thank you. - All righty. I built this convention from the ground up when Roswell was nothing more than a joke. Now we attract world-renowned experts, and our town thrives. We have over 100 exhibitors this year, and somewhere between, oh, 5,000 and 10,000 guests will pass through the doors. Hm. So, you're a skeptic, Mr. Norton? Oh, what makes you say that? Oh, I can always spot a non-believer. Well, I'm a reporter at heart, so I like to let the evidence guide my opinion. Well, there certainly is plenty of evidence here. I think you'll find it quite compelling. I sure hope so. I'm just curious about these sculptures. And which ones are the ones that allegedly abduct humans? Well, you mind if I give a little test to you? - Sure. - I'm just curious. Let me have you hold this. And I just want you to tell me if you feel anything whatsoever when you hold it. I feel like I'm holding a black... ...sculpture. Oh. Whoa. My hand just started tingling. In the future, perhaps you may have an experience. But regardless of what happens, you need to be open-minded and be in your heart. I know it's hard for you to believe this stuff, but as long as you keep pushing away any possibilities, you're limiting yourself. You don't want to do that. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you my card. Just give me a call. You're gonna have contact. And then they grabbed her photograph... It's hard to remember much. There was a bright light, and then two hours later, I was still just... there. Like nothing happened. Yeah, I understand that's fairly common... the light. It seemed to affect my ability to move. Yeah. And my memories... It did something with my memories. Okay, so, considering that, is it possible for you to even remember anything from the actual abduction? It was like a nightmare. It was cold, and that light, it... There was light everywhere, but not like it came from anywhere. I was strapped to a table. And they... they did things. Adam. Are you familiar with the phenomenon - known as false memory syndrome? - You think I made it up? No. I don't think you made it up intentionally. But it is a self-defense mechanism of the mind. I know what I saw! Okay, I remember when they took me. - I remember it. - Okay. Well, you said it yourself... It was like a nightmare. Maybe it was an actual nightmare. Leave me alone! You're just trying to hurt me - like the rest of them. - I'm not trying to hurt you. No, you're just trying to hurt me just like all of them. Okay, look. Listen. You've got to be willing to face the truth - if you're ever gonna get free. - No! Leave me alone! You're just like all of them, okay? - Whoa! Hey! Hey! - Adam. What the hell are you doing? Hey! This is my interview. Get the hell out of here. - I know what I saw. - It's okay. Come on. - I know what I saw. - What the hell are you doing?! What are you doing? I'm trying to help him out. He's got to be willing to confront the truth. The "truth" is none of your goddamn business! - But it's yours? - Yes! This is my friend! Who are you to determine what the truth is for anyone? I'm just trying to let him know and you that the truth is not an opinion. It's a verifiable fact. Okay. Well, then verify this. Go fuck yourself. Come on. Hey. Get over here. Now we got to find somebody else to interview. What the hell was going on in here? I was doing an interview, and he starts freaking out. I'm just asking him simple questions. Turn that off, please. I can't have any of this. I can't have it. Okay? You just need to pack up your stuff, and you need to get out of here right now. Just go. Everything's okay, folks. It's all right. Tell him it's okay. He can start up again. Everything's good here. We're all good. Sorry. Hey, who's that girl that just came in? Emily? She's a local girl. - Emily Reed. - Emily Reed. Maybe I was too harsh. I don't know. But I felt like I at least had to explain myself to Emily. Kyle found out she organizes some of community gathering just outside of town. That's what I love about documentaries... You never know where the story's gonna take you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hmm? We're going live on this one. You're the boss. Go, go, go, go. It's not knowing the truth that hurts... the most. Sorry to interrupt. We're with Emily. These guys with you? Agnes, it's okay. Go on. I just I feel like if I just knew what they wanted with me... what it is they were trying to do, then... everything would be okay. Hi. My name is Emily Reed. Hi, Emily. I was abducted the first time on my 7th birthday. Did she just say "abducted"? Did she say "the first time"? The second time was the day I turned 14. And then, seven years later, they came for me again. It doesn't matter where I hide or what I do. They always find me. And like all of you, what I want more than anything is to know why. Bye, guys. Thank you again. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Bye, Mike. - Good deal. See you next week. - All right. Is that dude your boyfriend? 'Cause he looked at me like he wants to punch me in the face. - So do I. - Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Let me explain. I was not trying to hurt Adam. - I was trying to help him. - Help him? By telling someone who's in pain that they're making it up? I was merely suggesting to him that maybe what he thinks - is real isn't. - What if there are - different versions of reality? - You can't have different versions of reality. - Reality is not an opinion. - Sure, it is. And it's my opinion that you're an asshole. There have been studies... And that's not an opinion. - There have been studies... - Studies. Studies. You know... the scientific things? Which prove that in order for healing to take place, people have to be willing to confront the truth. Okay, you know what? - Let me ask you something. - Shoot. What do you see? I see an arrowhead at the end of a necklace. What do you see? I see a stone that was formed millions of years ago and a weapon that was made by an ancient civilization and a piece of jewelry that I've had since before I can remember. Now, the "truth" is it's billions of atoms made of up trillions of protons, held together by zillions of electrons. But that doesn't make any of the other things less true. I don't think zillions is a real number. Sure, it is. It's just this side of a googolplex. Look, no one here actually knows "the truth." All I know for sure is that... something's been happening to me. - My whole life. - I believe you. But what evidence, what actual, hard, empirical evidence do you have that these experiences have been alien abductions and not some other kind of phenomenon? Well, maybe you can see for yourself. Sunday is my 28th birthday. Seven years to the day since the last time that I was taken. Nice work, Brent. So much for your hidden camera. Signing off. Do you think she's real? I don't know. I mean, she doesn't seem delusional. I mean, the repeated pattern of abductions is a little strange. That's definitely not usual. Well, maybe she just hates birthdays. Kind of like you a couple years ago, but I guess you wouldn't remember, 'cause you ended up passed out in the gutter. You know I don't like birthdays, and you know why. 'Cause they remind me of my mom. Emily's not like that, though, man. I'm telling you. She's displaying symptoms of FMS. Oh, shit. - Do you see that? - Huh? Look, look, look! - Right there. White light. - Where? White light. Right there. Get the camera. How am I gonna get the camera? I'll get the camera. It's getting closer. - Wow. Wow. - You know what? That's the problem with all this bullshit. You start thinking about it so much, and then next thing you know, your imagination is going crazy. Is that an alien campground? Oh! Shit! - Oh! - Shit, man! What the hell, dude?! This is why you never drive. - I just hit something. - What do you mean? - Like an animal? - It wasn't an animal, man. Something else. I don't... You're not going out there? Yeah. How else are we gonna know what you hit? Don't do it. Don't do it. - You're crazy. - Yeah, I'm crazy. Don't do it! Well, I'll be damned. Aah! Hey. You gotta come check this out. Look at this. Whoa. Oh. I guess you did hit something. - All right. Well... - It's in the bush, too. Oh, it goes this way. We can get in the car now. Oh, there's more. Dude, check it out. See the blood? I told you, man. It wasn't my imagination. There's something out there. Oh, oh! Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! - Oh, my... - It's just a pig. - Huh? - You thought we found E.T., - didn't you? Huh? - I just shit my pants. Move! Watch it! Oh, my God. Behind you. - Chris! - What? Dude, what the hell are you doing? Hey! - Get out of here! - Hey! - It's just a pig. - Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! There's something out there! Let's go! Come on! What the hell is wrong with you? There's nothing out there. Please, please, please. We got to go. Shit, buddy. - Oh, my... - It's just a pig. Brent did film something. He was convinced that it looked like this little black alien statue we saw at the convention. Just give me a call. Ooh. Huh. Is this what they were talking about? - We are looking for... - Hello? You hear something back there? - Hello? - Lose something? What can I do for you, my young, very good-looking man? Well, it seems that we met an associate of yours last night at the convention. Yeah, that would be my half sister, Hicktyn. You probably noticed she's, mm, not quite all there. That's because, uh, my stepdad is from... - Uh... - Joke. - Oh. - Oh. Anyway, we got a few questions for you about a sculpture that Hicktyn mentioned. Uh-huh? A guy in a black cloak? Yeah. This is the one. That's it. It's the one... that I saw. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I saw the footage. It's one of the more common sightings in these parts. Really? So, you're saying that this is an extraterrestrial? Absolutely. You know we get our fair share of non-believers, come to disprove this or that. But sooner or later, if they stay long enough... ...they come to realize the truth. Hmm. You come with me. I want to show you something. Come on, then. This is where I keep the real important stuff. Who's that? Oh, that's my husband, Ed. Just ignore him. This... ...is an interesting specimen. What the hell is that? It's a memory-stealing device. Or at least that's what we think. Most victims experience blackouts and losses of memory during abduction. Sometimes, after they return, whole chunks of memories are just... missing. Can I take a closer look at that, please? You know, I had it analyzed. They can't identify the materials. How much do you want for it? It's not for sale. It's not even mine. How'd you get it, then? Whose is it? I got it from the same person that described the black-cloaked figure. A local girl. Her name's Emily. - Emily Reed. - Emily Reed. Okay, this is her place. She's probably in her studio right now. That's the patio 'round back. You know, guys, probably not gonna be too happy to see us. But when has that ever stopped me? Hello? Emily, I just don't want to see you get hurt. That's all. I mean, look what he did to Adam. - He's clearly not one of us. - Hey. - We got to be careful. - Hey. What are you doing here? Ah, I could ask you the same thing there, cowboy. Will you kindly turn the camera off, please? Why don't you just pack up your stuff and just head on back home? She doesn't want to talk to you. - It's okay, Bill. - See? It's okay, Bill. Would do you know? I'd be on my best behavior, if I were you. My patience is waning. Is that a threat? - Just a little friendly advice. - Hm. What is all this? I sell art at all the local shops in town. Those are most wonderful-looking bicycle wheels I've ever seen. It's a dreamcatcher. It catches all the good dreams... And gets rid of all the bad ones. Right? How's that working out for you? What can I do for you, Mr. Norton? Well, last night, on the way home, we saw someone, driving. - Or something. - Well, someone dressed like this. Grab it. The lady from Seti Alpha 5 said it was carved from your description. It's not just mine. There are others. Listen, Emily, I'm not your enemy. Can you hand me those scissors over there, please? For you. Scissors. When I was 7, my mom left home. On my birthday, actually. And until the day he died, my father believed that she was abducted by aliens. But that was just a crazy story he made up in his head, of course. Just another one of his wild conspiracy theories. The truth is, he was an obsessive drunk who drove her away. It's not the aliens' fault she didn't come back. It's his. But no matter how hard I tried, no matter what I said, no matter what I did, I... couldn't get him to confront that truth. I don't understand what you want from me. There's a technique called regression hypnosis. A therapist can help you remember what really happened to you, what's still apparently happening to you. Okay. This is what regression therapy did for me. Very good, Emily. Now, free of any pain or upset, I want you to describe what you see. The lights are very bright, but it's... it's cold. Sterile. Like a hospital. Is there anyone else there with you? - I don't know. - It's okay, Emily. The memory is completely free of pain. Now, who else is there with you? They're, uh... They're tall. Good. Good. Go on. They're looking at me. They want something from me. What is it they want? I don't know. - I don't know what they want. - You have to look deep, Emily. The memory is there. You just have to dig deeper. I can't. No. I can't. - No! - It's okay. They'll hurt me! - They'll hurt me! - It's okay. They will! They don't want me to remember! No! No! I have plenty of sequels just like that. You guys can do a marathon night and watch them all, if you want. The lady from Seti Alpha 5 has something called a memory device. She said she got it from you. Do you know anything about that? Yeah. I, um... I found it the last time they brought me back. Okay. Found it where? Here. I'd like to get that device analyzed. Do you think you can get it back from Lucille? I don't think so. Brent and I can take it, get it analyzed, - find out where it came from. - I don't think so. I understand that, - but I think... - I don't think you're listening! I don't want to, and I really think you guys should leave. We got to get our hands on that device. How? You heard her. I don't know, but whatever's going on with that girl, it has something to do with that device. So, do you still not believe in aliens? Of course I don't. Why? Do you? I don't know. I saw that thing on the back of her head. That's some weird freakin' shit. Yeah, no shit it's weird freakin' shit. That's why we got to find out what the hell it is. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Sure. Why wouldn't it be? He's just been sitting there, waiting, since you went inside. - Who? - Bill. - Why? - I think he's worried - you're gonna hurt business. - Oh, business? You mean preying on peoples' fears for profit? I'm just saying. We should be careful. Bill's a powerful guy around here. What, are you saying he's dangerous? We don't want any trouble from him. That's what I'm saying. - There's rumors. - What rumors? What kind of rumors? That he used to be some kind of "contractor" for the military. Then, again, they're just rumors, right? Yeah, just rumors. I'd only known Emily for about 24 hours. Man, from the first moment I saw her, I knew. I knew. I knew I had to help her if I could. But how do you convince someone that what they believe... I mean, really believe... is untrue? Even worse... ...what happens when you start to believe it, too? All right, to activate the low-light sensor - if it gets dark, right here. - Okay. - Boom. - All right. Got it. Tighten this up. All right. - All right. - Think we're ready? All right, you ready? Huh? - Yeah, I'm ready. - Hey. Are you ready? - I'm ready, but... - All right. Let's go. You really need me to go? You really need me to go? There's no reason for both of us to commit a felony. Don't be dramatic. That thing's fake. And when we find out it's fake, I might need the footage as evidence to prove it. I don't want to go to jail, man. Let's make this a quick in and out. We're breaking and entering. Oh, man. We're now committing a crime. Ah. Look at that. Just trespassing. Okay. Just a little trespassing. That's not so bad. A doggy. Doggy. Check these out. - Dude, stop screwing around. - They feel so real. You know you've been in L.A. too long, then. Shit. It's all make-believe. Nothing here is real. - Would you shut up? - What? All right. Go. Hey. Turn off the light. Sweet. What? Did something... Shh. I don't know, man. That's it. - Oh! Dude! - Who's there? - Don't move! - Aah! Get out of my property, you sons of bitches! Open, open! Open, open, open! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Go! Go! Go! Go, go, go, go! - Come on! Get in! - Go, go, go, go! And don't you ever come back! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ohh! I just got shot by an old man in the leg. You think that's funny? - That's funny to you? - Yeah. It's not funny. You okay? Yeah. It's just a little bird shot. Grazed the skin. Hurts like hell, though. Good work, good work. - Oh! - Yeah! We've officially been shot at, my friend. I'm gonna use that. That will get me laid. I know it. I'm shot. - Have you ever been shot? - I've never been shot. Whew! Here, let me see that thing. - What thing? - The thing I just got shot for. Let me see it. - Why? - What do you mean, "why"? Because I want to see if it has "Made in China" stamped on it. Let me see the frickin' thing. What the hell is it all about, anyways? You got to see this thing up close, man. - I did. I held it. - No. You got to feel it. It's like nothing I've ever felt before. You sound like you're describing a woman right now. It feels more foreign than that. Oh! Ow! - What the hell? - Oh! What the... What the fuck was that? I don't know, man. I don't know. It felt like electricity, like, all through my hands. - What? From that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just rubbed it, and the frigging thing electrocuted me. Okay, okay. Okay, when we get back to the hotel, I'm gonna run it back the cameras and just watch it in slo-mo, and see what the hell just happened. The fuck was that? Here, give it back now. Gladly. Come on. - You're killing me here. - Just seeing if you're alive. Yeah, well... Where the hell you guys been? What do you mean? What's wrong? Nothing. I've been calling you for hours. What are you talking about? We've been gone, like, what, less than an hour? - It's 3:00 a.m., man. - What? - It's 3:00 a.m. - What are you talking about? - You guy left at 11:00. - What? - What the hell happened to him? - He got his ass shot. - You okay? - Crazy old guy. - It's a long story. - How is it 3:00 in the morning? It can't be. I got some footage you guys got to see. I'm gonna sync my cameras with the GoPros in the car... ...see what we got here. - Is it bad? - Aah! Aah! ...want to see if it's made in China. - See it? See it? - Just give me... This thing, it's like... It's like nothing I've ever felt before. You sound like you're describing a woman right now. No. No, it's even more foreign than that. Oh! - What? - You see that? Yeah, I saw that. Fried my camera. Here it is. There's the flash. That was the one I was telling you about. Wait. No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Keep playing. There's more. Okay. The hell you guys looking at? What the fuck? I don't remember this. I mean, this doesn't make any sense. We're just sitting there, staring. Okay. Just, uh... - Did the engine just die? - We're stopping the car. I never stopped the car. I never pulled over. But I never stopped the car. I never stopped driving. We were driving the whole time. Right? I mean... The thing shocked you. We're still driving. - I mean, what... - Look at the time. Time just keeps moving, but we're not going anywhere. We're just... Fast-forward. Fast-forward. Same. It's the same. It's the same. Okay, I'm... I'm freaked out now. Come on. Holy... Oh, now, what? We're just driving all of a sudden again? - This doesn't make any sense. - I don't know. - I don't know what to say. - It's impossible. It's literally impossible. Two hours. We sat there for two hours. I set out to prove that alien abductions were nothing more than false memories created by fragile minds to cover painful truths. But that's the problem with searching for the truth. Because if you're open and honest and willing to follow the evidence no matter where it takes you, sometimes... the truth can be more painful than the dream. And I know our viewers are really interested because you claim that you have some evidence. - Can you share that with us? - I didn't know at the time, but my little kid, Chris, he... He filmed you and your wife? Yeah, he filmed it all. And that's the tape? Can we see it? It's about you! It's about you all the time! So, what's happening there? Oh, that's me and my wife having a little argument. Too obsessed with my things and my wife. You know. So, there. Go to your room. Fast-forward. So, there. There. Keep watching. You see? That's it. There it is. That's the light. Can you see it? Up there. Becoming stronger and stronger, and then... And, Peter, you... So, you believe that Nell was abducted? Maybe we all were abducted. And they forgot to put her back. Yeah, I was gone, as I said, for a couple of hours. Then, when I came back, it's like... ...strange. To be gone for two, three hours. I've watched the video a thousand times. Every single time from the same perspective. But then, last night, something happened to us when we were driving home. There was a power surge. The power in the car went out, but the cameras kept rolling. The cameras caught us sitting in a trance for two hours. And we don't remember shit. And then I happened to think. My dad said the same thing. He said that, after the power surge, he blacked out for several hours. As much as I don't like it, I can't ignore the similarity. I have to know what happened last night, and I have to know what happened to him. I already know what happened. All you know is that somebody attached this device - to the back of your head. - Where did you get that? Is that why the sheriff's been calling me? I told you... I don't want any part of this! Don't you want to know what it is? - Don't you want to know why? - You know what? Unless you find some way to communicate with "them," - you can't find out why. - Oh! You'd just rather have your head in the sand? I want to know! We have to find out where the thing came from. It's my birthday tomorrow. I know. That's why... ...you have to let me lead you to the truth. Why do you care so much? I mean, we just met. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if it will change anything. I don't think it will. But... ...if you really do want to stay with me, I'm going someplace today. Someone who might be able to help. Do you want to come? Okay. Pull over for a second. Okay. Wow. I've heard a lot about this place. It's home of the Ancestral Pueblo peoples. Some call them Anasazi. You know, they ruled this area for hundreds of years. Let me grab my camera, get some top view of this place. There's still a lot of unanswered questions about their civilization. Yeah, like why they built those pits. Allegedly contact with extraterrestrials. You okay? Yeah. We should get to the pueblo. It's not too far. - Just make a right here. - Right here? Yeah. Not to be cynical, but... I'm still not sure how these people can help you. Well, for starters, they believe me. These people, they practically raised me. They were there when no one else cared. They taught me what it was like to have a family... ...and helped go through some really hard times. They're pretty incredible people. You might want to show some respect. I don't mean to be disrespectful. I'm just trying to understand. You can pull up just right here on the left. - We made it. - Yep. It's up here. Hi, Pants. You know these guys? Yeah. Good boy. Whew-whew! Whew. You ought to try the sheep chili. It's out of this world. Literally. Elu. I'm glad you came. It has been too long. - Mm. - Elu? It's the Indian name I was given. John, this is Chris Norton. He's a filmmaker. This is John Greatbear. He's the village medicine man and the closest thing I have to a father. More like grandpa. He's the one who says he can protect me. But how can you protect her? My people have history... with the old ones. We have made an arrangement in the past. Wait. The "old ones"? Is that the ancient Ancestral Pueblo peoples? Okay. It's cold outside. Thank you. Hey, nice to meet you. I'm Brent. Camera guy. I love chili. There's a ritual. Something that might convince them not to take me. It hasn't been done in a while, but it can't hurt to try, right? I just don't want anything to happen to you. I don't either. Come, my friend. Sit with us. Let us our mind in the cold... ...and warm our heart in here. Drink. Don't be afraid. Who... me? You sure you want to do that? Remember Malibu? Doing mushrooms, running around naked? Not a good idea. What are you doing? I want you to wear this for a while. I could never remember where I actually got it. So I just made up my own story. I was with my mom, and we were picking flowers. And they smelt so wonderful, and... ...then we turned into the rainbow, and... the little shadow that runs across the grass into the sunset. This was always there to remind me that... sometimes dreams are more real than the truth. Don't let go of the dream. I won't. See you on the other side. You took everything from me! You took my mother! You took my mom! You took my mom! You beat me, you beat me, and you beat me! You took my mom! You took my mom! I thought you were a dead man. I thought you OD'd on that stuff. - What happened? - You freaked out. You don't remember anything? No, not really. Hey. How are you feeling? Oh, God. Like I got run over by a truck. So... what's Crazy Bear saying? Greatbear. Nothing yet. He's waiting to see if the ritual worked. How long until we know? - Couple hours. - Oh, God. A couple hours. We're supposed to sit here and wait until then? Yeah, pretty much. I think my hand's turning blue. Hmm? Oh. Sorry. How are you so calm? I don't know. Normally I'd be a wreck, but... ...I think it's you. I just... I don't feel afraid now because of you. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. All right, well... ...you got the rough cut and the raw footage? - Yeah. Why? - All right. I'm gonna get to work. My name is Chris Norton. And I'm a documentary filmmaker. I shot my first film, if you can call it that, on my 7th birthday. This way. There is a way of a thing, and some outside our understanding. The ceremony did not work. I am very sorry. What does that mean? It means the sky people will come. They will take her. There is nothing more that we can do. Do you know how much time we wasted? Hours. We wasted hours. I could have her in Fort Knox by now. It will not matter. They need her. What could they possibly need her for? Something important. Something they have lost through time. Their civilization honors the rational mind, but has forgotten the gift. They need to find a way back... ...to their soul. I drank your potion. I trusted you. We trusted you. You said that you could help her. Let's just go, okay? Let's go, okay? Let's go. Elu. You were chosen for a great cause. It is a burden that is part of your destiny. Don't let go of the dream, my child. I'm sorry. - Okay, look, where are we going? - I don't know where we're going. Somewhere to protect her. We need to get her somewhere safe. I don't know. Somewhere where we can create a defense, all right? Sounds like a plan. Not sure what it means exactly. But we'll get somewhere safe. You don't understand. It doesn't matter where we go... - or what we do. - Look out! What the hell is that? Ah, but what the fuck is this? No, no, no. I'm gonna drive now. What? Chris. Move the car! I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. - It's not going. - Come on! Move! It's not moving! - Lock the doors! - Oh, shit. - Don't! - Emily! Emily! - Emily! - Ow! Aah! No! Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily! Hey! Emily! Oh! Aah! Aah! You sons of bitches. I didn't want it to come to this, that's for sure. I was told you were doing a story on abduction, not a hatchet job on our way of life. Then, when I found out your true intent, well, I asked you to leave, but you didn't listen, did you? It's all a bunch of bullshit? Oh, no. It's quite real. We just help perpetuate the truth. Jesus Christ. The footage is on the laptop, but they might have copies. We have to be sure. You were right about the false memories, you know? Even more than you think. What the fuck are you doing? Don't worry. I'm a pro. I've done this a hundred times. Now, back in the MK-Ultra days, it was trial and error. But now we got it down to a science. All it takes is a little military-grade hallucinogen and a little creative set design, and your subconscious mind will absolutely be convinced that this abduction was real. Don't worry. In a couple minutes, you'll black out, and two hours from now, you'll remember what everyone else does. Aah! Aah! Well, damn. I missed the vein. Steel rooms. Figures in black. Bright lights and... Hold still. Hold still, God damn it. You hold still, 'cause, otherwise, I'll get the cattle prod, and I'll hit you with it again. Don't you worry. It'll all be over soon. And the great Chris Norton will corroborate the truth. That alien abductions are real. - Aah! Aah! - God damn it! You crazy son of a bitch! As usual, you just have to do it the hard way, don't you? Well... ...I think I'll just... go get a cattle prod and another needle. Don't go anywhere... ...cowboy. - Hey, man. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - Quiet. - Where are we? It's Bill. We got to get out of here. - What a dick. - Quiet. Chris? - All right. - Where are we? - Shh, shh. It's okay. - Are we... No. It's all Bill. - It's not real. - What? - Yeah. - Bill? What are you talking about? Chris? Shh. Shh, shh, shh. It's all a hoax. It's been Bill all along. - What? - It's all a setup. It's all bullshit... the metal table, the abductions, all of it. - Just breathe, okay? - What are you talking about? - Just breathe. - It doesn't make any sense. It happened to me my whole life. It's all a hoax. It's all bullshit. It's all a setup. It doesn't make any sense. The first time it happened, I was so young. It doesn't make any sense. I know. I know. We're gonna do this together. Come on. I'm gonna get us out of here. Man, you're bleeding. Oh, yeah. There. Yeah. Just stay quiet, okay? They're right out there. Let's go. All right. I need a beer. - Oh! - You okay? Jesus. Where are we? What? We got to turn around. Find another way out. Oh, shit. Over here! Bill! Watch him. Yeah. There ain't nowhere to go. Is there, boy? All right. You don't want this to get out of hand. We'll give you all the footage, and we'll go. Oh, my God. Bill. No, Bill, stop! Stop! Bill! Emily! Emily! Where... Emily. Okay. Emily. Wake... up. Emily. Emily. I need you to listen to my voice. Okay? I need you to come back to me. I've never met anyone like you in my life. You're kind to people. You take care of them. Emily. I need you to wake up. That's it. You can do it. Concentrate on my voice. Concentrate. You can create your own dreams. Okay. That's it. Okay. There you go. - Chris? - Yeah. You're here. Are you okay? Yeah. Oh, God. - Help me out here. - I'm afraid if I push the wrong one, something bad will happen. Yeah, well, we gotta try something, right? And I won't hold it against you if my eyeballs explode or anything. Come on. No pressure. Oh. Good. What do we do now? I don't know. Figure out how to get the hell out of here. Who's there? What? Chris. What do you want? Stay back. Stay back. No. No more of that. We're done with that. How many times have I told you never to do this?! - You get off him! - Hey! Stay out of it! I don't remember this. - What is wrong with you?! - Get away! Hey! Stop it! Shut up! Nell! Where are you going?! Are you happy now?! Just come on back! Chris. Go on, keep back. Nell! Nell! What? They took you. No. That's impossible. Make it stop. Make it... What do you want?! Aah! Aah. Aah! Uhh! Stop. Please. Please stop! Who are you? We are the product of human evolution over many years. What? In time, our ego crystallized. We have become tethered to reason, and something is lost. What are you doing to us? We erased the bad memories to understand if your future could be different than the past. We don't need you. Not anymore. Please. We just want to go home. Hey, guys. Did you see that light? You... Did you guys see that UFO... in the sky? Huh? Don't ignore me. Hey. Hey, guys. Hey! Over here! Channel 4, NMX News. We have reports of strange lights. - Who are you? - We're filmmakers. We're from Hollywood. We're making a documentary. An unbelievable story that adds yet another claim of alien abduction in our community. Our reporter Kelly Lamas has the story. - Kelly. - Thank you, Carlos. I'm in McKinley County, where local artist Emily Reed... Turns out we were gone for only two hours. Kyle disappeared. As for us, we can only remember flashes, but... we remember enough. Are you on any narcotics? I'm not sure what happened. There was a light in the sky. And I think... I think it was UFO. Our story was dismissed as being the product of hallucinogenic drugs. The irony is, I became the thing I was most resistant to. - I became the story. - ...may finally shed some light on this controversial phenomenon. Is it aliens, or is it just the mind playing tricks? Take that! - What?! - Oh! Oh, no! - Brent! Come on! - These things happen. You know what? I actually like you. - What do you mean? - Nothing. You know what happens when we tell him. I know, but Brent likes to participate. He's gonna make it worse. He likes to participate. He likes to feel like he's part of it. Surprise! Surprise! - Hey, give me the face. - Yeah! - Is it for me? - Yeah, it's for you. - It's okay. - It's okay. Happy 7th birthday. We saw a light in the trees. And I got up. Went up for a closer look. And I was hit by a blast of energy from the craft that knocked me unconscious. I woke up on board the craft. Do you have any hard, actual, physical evidence? Subtitles by explosiveskull
