This film was motivated by the race horse "Luna", with a congenital handicap on her legs. Jeju Island, 2008 Always rains when I come to Jeju. Call it jinx of the auction day. Oh, and darling Don't eat sashimi at any odd place. It's low quality. You know that guy Young-gu down at Seogipyo area? Who? The short fella with glasses. Only his place serves good sashimi. That place is low quality as well. No, it's the real stuff. Hey, punk. Hurry up for Christ's sake! When I tell you to do something, do it right. Please. What's there to life? It's strong finish. Be on your way now. Go off now. Hurry up. Goddamn it. What? Jong-seop? Mr. Yoon, we've loaded Wubak. Still working at the track. They let you keep your job after killing a man? Hello. Let's go, man. Yes, let's get outta here. Come on, sweetie. How can they transport a horse like that? It's not a pig! I haven't seen this one before? Do I look more handsome every time you look at it? After I win the Winner's Cup, we'll have a huge wedding. I don't care about the wedding. Just don't hurt yourself. Yea-seung, don't lean against the window. Come on. CHAMP I worked my ass off to train him and what do I get? Come on, man. Yes to this and Yes to that. You're a Yes Man, aren't you? You know the old man's temperament. Like I give a rat's ass. I should be a stable owner so I don't put up with this crap. You idiot! I told you not to sleep here. What are you, a horse? How can you sleep in this pile of shit? Must have dozed off. With you for a dad, every day. no wonder your kid hangs out here. Why don't you go to a motel? What's with that face? Nothing. Yes, we should move out. Yeah, get your ass out of here. I fed and housed you for the last 3 years. - Come on. Let's go. - Yeah, let's go. All the energy wasted on that loser. No shame when he can't even earn his own bread. He needs to ride a good horse to earn his bread! Let's go eat, honey. My daddy can ride better than him. What do you think you're looking at? A raccoon. Let's go. Just like bums on the street. We're not bums. What? You look like a raccoon! What the f...? Aren't we going? You need to pack up by today. Who's a raccoon? I told you not to come to the stable. I had something to say to the raccoon. What? You said you can win if you ride Fine Works. That's why I went. To tell him to give you a good horse. Hey! Jesus! You, Bastard! Stop following me around. Just pay me back. Hey! Don't wear that hat. You look like an idiot. Just 1 0 grand then, for now. What? 1 0 grand? Are you nuts? You like me. What's this? Can't you see? Mounted police. Mounted police? Yes, a public official. A government worker? I'm a jockey. A jockey who can't enter a race? You said you can't see well with your left eye. Think about Yea-seung. No one knows about my eye problem. Seung-ho! And don't talk to me about my eye again. What about Yea-seung? Many fans are here to watch the 201 1 Championship race. About how many? About a hundred. Is that it? May be around 50 thousand. Daddy! Didn't even wash his hair. And nose is red from drinking too much. Yes, that's not good. Should wash hair and not drive under the influence. Our esteemed commentator, Ms. Lee, how do you see this race? I see it with my eyes. Thank you for that professional commentary. As we speak Lee Seung-ho spurts out of the gate at a frightening speed. Yes, he overtakes the American horse as well as the Chinese horse. Looks like a definite win for Lee Seung-ho. That's the correct answer. 200 meters to the finish. Lee is racing at a spectacular speed! Takes over the Japanese horse at the lead. Truly amazing. 30 meters! 20 meters! 1 0 meters! Crosses the finish line! Yes! Win for Lee Seung-ho! Why let Seung-ho ride? Gotta get an idiot ride it to get paid the dividend. Don't get pushed around. No wonder they call you shit horse. Can't believe that idiot. You're riding FIREWORKS this week.

On the day, if I'm sure that I can come in first place, I'll get off the horse at the paddock. That's our signal? You're not joking, are you? No, but I need a house. A house? You'll bet your kid on this? What's life? - One shot? - Yes, one shot! Life is strong finish. Let's buy our Seung-ho an apartment this week. Apartment! Get an apartment. Seung-ho! Seung-ho! Across the bridge under star light Come in at 2nd place. Not 1 st! What? Change of plans. Not 1 st but 2nd, got that? Don't whip her! We need to come in 2nd! Good luck! Get down, man!

One million? Stupid bastard. Don't whip! He's racing in the opposite direction. Out of the way! Out of my way! I told you to get out of the way. Daddy! You came the wrong way and ran into me. I'm okay. - Where are you going? - Daddy! Hey! You idiot! I am fucked, you imbecile! I told you to finish second, not last. Hey, Seung-ho! Who are these punks? We're book-makers. What the...? Go!

Okay? Steady... steady... Good luck! Good luck, bro! You gotta get in closer. That's not a Jeju pony you're dealing with. Why don't you come out and try. Yeah, you punk! What a bunch of retards! Daddy, they have a donkey here. This is the way to handle a horse. That's a rope, not a horse. Wubak! Wubak! Holy shit! Shit! He's dead. Are you okay? Carry him! Hurry! Hurry up and carry him. She's coming this way. I'm sorry. Sorry, Wubak! Help me! Take me! I don't know Latch the gate! The latch! Stay away. Wubak! Wubak! What are you doing? - Hurry! Hurry! - Wubak! Wubak! Hey, get away! I said, get away. Hey! - You? - It's you. Daddy, medicine. Medicine? It's vitamins. To make his eyes better. A jockey with poor eyesight? He's a jockey. Maybe it's a scheme to get rid of one of us. Why don't you go and raise the issue? Yes. Make him realize who he is dealing with. Hey! I told you not to use Jeju dialect in front of me When do we ride? It's been a while since we got selected. Not selected. Accepted. Due to shortfall of application. We came to ride horses, not clean up horseshit. Police my ass. Who the hell are you? Trying to ride when you can't even catch a horse? Riding a horse and catching a horse are two different things. Yes, they are indeed different things. Yeah? Oh, come on, man! This is a donkey, not a horse. Ride this? That was funny. Are you alright? This is harder than it looks. I'm fine. I don't need your help. You fall and ride on. That's how it works. I'm really gonna ride this time, okay? Where should I go? Halla mountains? Be right back! Hee haw! Why are you moving? Hee haw! Hee haw! Why aren't you moving? Hee haw! Are you okay? Did the jockey see this? Hopeless. Pretend you're dead. Bro! Bro! Look! There goes the donkey. How can we live here? Aren't we going to the tracks? I miss Yun-heui. Change into this. Are we going to the tracks? We're not going. Why not? You're a jockey. Hey kid, why would a jockey come to a place like this? My daddy is a jockey. A jockey with 300 wins! I'm not a jockey. Daddy is not riding anymore. Okay? I like you most when you're racing. Hey, come down here. Are you looking for a wife that ran away? What? My mommy went to heaven. There can be other wives. Don't. Stop it. Daddy. Let go! Show me what you got! Daddy. What's going on? I told you not to wear the horse mask. You said you don't want to see me cry. Cowboy. Arizona cowboy. Racing across the plain. Hey, come over here! Did you see me getting attacked yesterday? What did I do? I got on my back and like this. And you got punched? Who got punched? I'm an ex-marine. No-one in this island joins the army. You're all marines! I was in the army. That freak! Listen to me until I finish. If you were that bastard, what would you have thought? What a crazy punk? Right? You're pretty smart. Stomp on me. Really stomp on you? Stomp, trample. Hurry. - Only because you told me to. - Stomp on me, you bastard! Start stomping! Man, you kicked for real. Remember this. Roll, block and kick! Why tie a horse to the boiler room? She'll know how to behave after it's gone through cold and hunger. I think that's enough. Let's feed it. Feed it? I've spent over 1 0 grand already feeding it. A horse that won't let be ridden is a dog. So we put her on sale but no-one would buy her! What can I do? Then sell her as meat. She's no meat. You can't sell her. What? I'll butcher it and get paid for its meat. You just wait. You wanna mess with me? Don't sell her! You want someone to ride her. Look at the eyes. Not my eyes. Wubak's eyes! Do you know what those eyes are saying? Crazy bastard. He's got style. Probably since he's a jockey. Style my ass! It's the clothes he's wearing. That idiot! Feels good? Yes! I think you're better than the jockey. At least I don't get dragged around by a horse. It's a donkey. Martial Art of Self-Defense: Chapter 3 When the enemy approaches, calmly drink water. Drink water? Attack me. Coming in! Disgusting! My face is gonna decay. - You never brush your teeth. - It won't decay. It will! No big deal about the jockey. Perhaps he's a delivery boy jockey. Cover it up. It's not good for her education. Newbie, you might think we're losers but to us you're also a loser. Let's not get on each other's nerves. What? How do you erase this? With an eraser! What nerves coming into the stables! I think they also came into the main stadium. That shows him again at the paddock last Saturday. When? Last Saturday, sir. That feels good. What are you looking at? Are you bleeding? Hey! Hey, open up! Tell us where Seung-ho is! Do you know how many women I buried? This isn't an interrogation room. With all that intimidation from me, she'll rat him out soon enough. Let's see. Jeju motel, Jeju Bank, Jeju... Jeju Island? Flower has blossomed! Flower has blossomed! Hey! No mercy anymore. Load her up. - What are you doing? - Why do you kick a human being? What do you think you're doing now? Hurry up and load her up. What are you doing? What can we do with a cripple horse that even throws a jockey off? Use her to plow the land? So? You said she'll make the best race horse. You said she'll be an investment! I was crazy to listen to you. I'll sell her. Do I seem like a push over? Turn the ignition! What? He says we gotta sell off Wubak. Let's go! Push! Push! Aren't we going to sell the horse? You happy being a sell out? Happy to clean horse shit? If she was born as a race horse, she's gonna race once. With crippled legs? Is there a law against her racing? You can't be like that to Wubak. What do you mean? I'm next to Cho Seong-hyeon who recorded 300 wins in the shortest time in history. - Hello. - Hi. I was on my toes watching the race How do you feel? I truly appreciate all your support. I will pay you back with a win. You're tactic was staying behind of the pack and passing it at the last moment. Has your strategy always been like that? Life 's about strong finish. That's a great statement. Life 's strong finish. Can you say something to your fans about the Winners Championship? That's strange. Do you remember 3 years ago? The accident took place right here. It's coincidence is almost eerie. You lost Yea-seung's mom and Wubak lost its foal. You and Wubak both have deep sorrow inside. Let's forget everything. Lower the bridle! Lower the bridle! You wanna be sold as horse meat? Lower the bridle! Or you'll be sold as meat! Lower! Lower! Lower! You'll die if you keep this on. You wanna be meat? You gotta let me ride you! You lost everything? I lost everything too. Wubak, Eat this. Wubak! Daddy! Wake up! Wubak is not well. Daddy is aching more. Wubak's down. She might die. No, I might die. Daddy. What? Is it bad? She'll be okay. I thought it was serious. Brush her up well. No, it's not that. No, it's not that. I told you to tame her, not make her a cripple. Who'd do such a thing? She had a slight fever. Let's go. Where to? Cowboy, Arizona cowboy... Crossing this ocean... Arizona cowboy- - With Wubak on this boat. - Turn off the engine. But, why? Hey! What are you doing? I'm killing my horse. That's what. Are you crazy? She's alive! Can't tame her. Can't do nothing. Who cares if I kill her? So you drown her alive? You feel bad for her? Of course! It's struggling to stay alive. Then, you go save her. Hey! Help! I can't swim. This is live burial. It's too much. - You! - Yes, sir. - Help me! - Do you want be thrown in as well? Help! You bastard! Wubak! Wubak, Wubak! Wubak, help me! Wubak... Wubak... First time seeing a horse save a human. Let's also get started. With what? Aren't you going to ride horses? Of course! Go Daddy! First condition of riding a horse is for the horse and rider to become one. Daddy! Let's sleep. One, two, three! Wash the horse clean every morning just as you'd wash yourself. Bend. Lift. Lower. 45 degrees. It's the monkey position. Monkey! Are you good? Let's ride, Boss! Shall we ride? Shall we? Boss, they have a donkey here! Pathetic! Boss, this is the last location. If they're not here, they've immigrated. Of course! Why didn't see it before? That rat! Rat! What's this? Police? - Ask him. - Yes, sir. Excuse me... Don't ask! What if he's a real cop? Act properly when the president comes out. Exit immediately after the ceremony. Got it. Daddy... Pee... Pee? Did you find something? Still looking, boss. Hurry up! Shit! There he is. Over there! That bastard! Where is Seung-ho? Hurry up and find him! Over there! Horse! Brother! How have you been? Daddy! Daddy! Let her go, punk! Why did you go so far? All the way to Jeju? Let's just settle the account. Forget the interest, 1 million for principal. Gwang-gyu, it's been a while. Boss! It's a trap. Daddy! Front gate! Go! Hurry! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Where is he? Bathroom. Horse track in this beautiful Jeju Island... Emergency! Emergency! What? He's trying to catch us on a horse? Shit! Pedal to the metal! Sand! Sand! Yea-seung! You know Seung-ho? - Yea-seung! - Daddy! Find out what's going on. Yea-seung! Daddy! They got her! In the car. Watch out! Horse! Sir! You alright? Hurry! Go get them! Help me! - Save me! - Stop crying! Dad! Come for it. Come in, you punk. What a freak! Roll, block and kick. Find an emergency exit. Help me! Find the exit! Daddy! Daddy! Stop that! Help me! Quit it! - Stop it! - Save me! You know how many kids I buried? My eye! Yea-seung! Daddy! Yea-seung! No! It's ok now. Great work! Private Kim Sang... Let's sit. Illegal gambling was a big headache. On behalf of the association, we are grateful. As the protector of... I heard you were a jockey before. Yes, sir. How can I repay you for your important contribution? May I ask for anything? Please. Jockey. And you? May I ask for anything? I also dreamed of becoming a jockey... Do you know a good pork barbeque restaurant? Despite our start, I think I'll miss you guys. We meet and then we depart, that's just how it is. Happy to go to Seoul? Please. No need. Take it. You don't have to. Seriously. Here. I said, no need. Don't be like that. It's from our heart. Good luck! We'll be cheering for you. - Let's go. - Commander! - Good-bye! - Bye, Yea-seung! I told them not to bother. What's this? Invoice for Yea-seung's bed Those clowns! What's is this? It was a present. Take it back! How can you scam a little girl? How was that a scam? Send the money. That's not how it should be done. We got an image to protect. Can't we do it? Can't we get rid of Yoon? As a decision of the association. Like pulling out weed. What else can he do for a living? Jeju's nice? What's there to worry? He's been there for a while. He only knows horses. Can't be so sympathetic. Who's coming? What courage! I couldn't set a foot at the race track. Everyone knows you killed Kyeong-il. How can you walk around with your head up? You do. Shamelessly. And take those glasses off. You look like a raccoon. Fuck you. Do you have mackerels? Of course. - How much? - 3 bucks. What are you buying again? Yea-seung likes it. And it's only 3 bucks. Wow, you're wearing a skirt. What are you doing? First time seeing you in a skirt. Forget about it. Give it to me. - Hope your business prospers! - Thank you. Get a regular paycheck and an award for catching criminals, you should put your roots down over there. A jockey can't leave the race track. Do you have liver? Fresh cow liver. Yea-seung eats liver? No, for you! It's good for your eyes. My eyes are great. I can see you fine. What is it? What's wrong? Did you get plastic surgery? What? Cowboy. Arizona Cowboy. Racing across the plain. Arizona Cowboy. Are you going to play? A cold shower will teach you. Ah! What! Hey! Go play somewhere else. Winner's is here. Look! 2011 Winners Cup Championship It's a tournament. Win four races to get to the finals. You lose and it's game over. No worries. What's there to life? History only remembers the winner. Yea-seung, over there. Give me a break! I told you, no water play. You gonna have your kid take care of the horse? Hey, what's the big deal? She's just a kid. Are you a raccoon? Daddy will do it. Don't wash the horse from now. Have the younger guys do it. Have you heard anything about Seung-ho? Apprantly, he'll enter the Winners Cup. What a joke! No, not that. Then what? There's something weird. He's always been weird. We have a familiar face in this race. - Number 6, Lee Seung-ho. - Seung-ho? Riding Number 7, Wubak, he looks forward to his comeback race. The great fortune-teller Mr. Hwang, how do you think he'll do? Hello. Yes, this GUBAK horse. It's Wubak. Yes, Wubak. But this horse has no track record. Yes, this horse is seven years old. Although we're an aging country, I think the horse is just too old. Anyway, we hope to see something new in this comeback race. We're not going to have a problem right? This can blow up later in our faces. You're wearing padded shoes. Just the same thing for the horse. Why don't you go back to your business? The president must be losing his senses. Crippled horse. You gotta be kidding. Don't overdo it. If the nail presses against the nerve, it's over. Yes. Not a chance for Seung-ho. Look! Look at the odds against him. Pretend I never had this 1 00 dollars. Are you out of your mind? Number 1 raises its head too high. so the speed is reduced. Number 2's strides are too small so it'll come in 5th at best. 3 and 4 races ahead so will interfere with each other and lose. Number 6 Lee Seung-ho, just forget about him. Then what's left? It's Number 5, 8 and 1 0. Then you're bet should be on 5, 8 and 1 0. It's 5, 8 and 1 0. 1400 meter Winners Cup preliminary race. The horses spurt out of the gates. The horses find their positions towards insides of the track. And outside Lee Seung-ho on Wubak, no. 6... If you overdo it from the beginning, you'll get too tired and will fall back. Not yet. Let's save it. Lee Seung-ho is completely out of the race. Yes, that is surprising. Don't let it bother you. They don't know how fast you are. Five, Eight, Ten! You know, Commission? Of course! Hold just a bit more. Wubak! Now! He's going! He's going! Yes! We have an unexpected phenomenon. A little more. Give it a bit more! Yes! An unexpected event! Against all expectations, Lee Seung-ho and Wubak come in first only after second comeback race. What is that? How can that shit horse come in first place? You said he was out? How can you be so wrong? Goddamn it! You said Seung-ho's bust. Bust my ass! You bum! Even the heavens can't predict horse racing. What? If I knew, would I tell you? I'd just win on my own. What an imbecile! Refund our money. Stop right there! Lee Seung-ho spurts out of the gate, speeding as if his life is on the line. Yes, beating the American and Chinese horses. It looks like a certain win for Lee Seung-ho. That's right! 200 meters to finish line. Lee Seung-ho at a frightening speed. He catches the Japanese horse in the lead! Yes, it's amazing. 30 meters, 20 meters, 1 0 meters! Crosses the finish line! Yes, win for Lee Seung-ho! Yea-seung! Daddy! Wait in the rear then cut ahead to the finish line, okay? That will kill her. Go! Okay, okay! Turned, turned, turned! Cut ahead. You got that? Cut ahead. Straight, straight. Straight, straight! Yes! It's a tip. Fighting spirit of the veteran. Lee Seung-ho ascends as the eye of the storm. Face-off with Cho Seong-hyeon expected. Who is Lee Seung-ho? Easy, easy! How can you forget your goggles? When your eyes are not... Daddy can see fine. Look! What does this say? Jockey Yoon Tae-hyuk. And, this guy? Ham Wan-sik. It's brother Wan-sik. Ham Wan-sik. Then, this person? You, you. Come on. It's daddy See? Daddy can see really well. How many? Without blinking. Five? It just feels it got improved because interocular pressure changed. Actually your eyesight has gotten worse since the accident. It wasn't five? Run, Wubak! You have to start letting people know. It'll be difficult to ride anymore. I'm doing good, huh? You're so big now. You used to be this small. I was that small? Me? I can remember. You shitting and peeing. You can remember when you close your eyes? Do you want to try? What do you see? Umm... your face. Are you crying? No, I yawned. Stupid! He's on heavy medication. Really? I check it out myself. That rat. I won't leave him alone this time. Mr. Park! Mr. Park! Mr. Park! Hard work covering the preliminaries! Not too bad. You want a source? What is it? Exclusive headlines! Seung-ho's on medication. His eye's messed up. One dollar! What's this? Crap! It's not good to lose so much weight. Bad for the bones. If I lose 1 00 grams, Wubak becomes 1 0 kilograms lighter. 1 0 minutes more. Geez. Mr. Yoon, the headline says Seung-ho's blind. Are you out of your mind? You want to see heads roll? What's all this? Gifts from the fans after the reading the news article. What? Fans? It's just crazy. Everyone's crazy. Did you see this? Did you see it or not? As if a crippled horse is not enough, you put a blind jockey on it? We got a repeat offender here. First Kyeong-il, now you want to kill Seung-ho? You'll kill off all the jockeys. Murderer! Murderer? What about you guys? What? You guys? Kyoung-il had ligament problem. So, I wanted him out of the race. But you guys forced him into racing. What are you talking about? Saying we can't cancel the race and have profits fall. You killed him like that. Am I right or wrong? So, I let him into the race this time. So I won't take the fall like 1 0 years ago. So I won't take the blame like an idiot! Who are you trying to blame after all these years? And, who's going to believe you? That imbecile. Let me ask you something. Did you know Kyeong-il was injured? I knew. But what can I do? He was the only one making money for us. That crazy bastard! What's with the bone soup? You were just telling me to lose weight. Anything going on with you? Why? Because we're too good? Thank you. Don't eat so salty when watching your weight. I'm sorry. She's shy. Is it because only Seung-ho's been riding her? What's going on? Why is he riding Wubak? Let's talk later. Turn. Turn again. Get off! Why are you riding Wubak? You could've gotten yourself and Wubak killed. Why didn't you say anything? You should've told me, at least. What if I did? You wouldn't have let me race. Just like Kyeong-il. What? I thought you promised when burying Wubak's foal. To make Wubak a great race horse. I promised in front of my dying wife. To be the best jockey. If I let go of the reins, I'm already dead. I'll be letting go of everything. Are you happy to see mom? Look how big she is now. You're the same. I've gotten old, haven't l? I cut my hair short to look younger. But I guess it's no use. Honey, What am I gonna do? I can't see your face clearly. I wanna see. I wanna keep my promise. I have to win and have our wedding. And raise our Yea-seung. Protect her. What am I gonna do? Please help me. I don't think this is right. - Seung-ho! - Hurry up! - Congrats! - Thank you. Congrats. You're in final round. Hurry up. We got no time. Aren't you going to race? I know. The horse won't move. Why don't you come here and push the horse? What? Am I a jockey? Oun-ho! Don't disappoint Wubak! What's this? What's a jockey doing on the ground before the race? Trainer Yoon! Do something! You want to blow this race? We only have 1 0 minutes left. Seung-ho! Seung-ho! They're looking for you. What? Wubak just dropped Oun-ho. Hurry down. Hurry! Let's do this. You really wanna die? I see no fear. You know I've been out for 1 0 years because of Kyeong-il. If I die, I'll die after crossing the finish line. What are you doing? There's only 2 minutes left. My daddy is a jockey. A jockey with 300 wins! I don't care about the wedding. Just don't hurt yourself. You said you would keep your promise! Daddy, look at me. Wubak, I'll be looking at you. At you only, and nothing else. Go! Wubak has no chance in this race. Number 9 leads the pack with 1 0 and 3 following closely behind with number 6, Wubak behind the pack What is that! Decision from the photo evaluation is out of the four horses winning by inches, Lee Seung-ho's Wubak will enter the final round. He's going, going, going! Yea-seung! Daddy! Yea-seung! Uncle! How have you been? You've gotten prettier. Happy birthday! We'll throw your birthday party here next year. Yea-seung, remember Piggie? It's Piggie! Look at me. You shouldn't have. You know how nervous I got after reading the papers? Let's finish this and go ride. Yes, sir! He's in no shape to ride. You should've restrained him. How can a blind person ride a horse? Daddy can see fine. Old man spoils the party when he should be cheering. Who's here to cheer? Look at the poor kid. You have to stay strong, you understand? Why are you doing this? Daddy can see fine. I hate you. Yea-seung! You came far enough. Think about Yea-seung. Daddy! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Are you hurt? - It's okay. It's alright. - So sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for dry cleaning. Yea-seung, it's okay. Daddy? You should've been careful with kids around! It's okay, Yea-seung. It's alright. I'm sorry. Daddy! I was just playing. I can see fine. Baby, what's wrong? Are you crying? What's this? What about this? And this? You can't see anything? You can't see my face? Daddy! Can't you see my face? Love you, Daddy! Go for it! He can't see an inch in front of him. He can die like Kyeong-il. Why do you keep mentioning death? It's bad luck. Living without dreams? Is that living? That's death. There's no dream or reason to ride when he's dead. My father can't see. He can't see. What if daddy falls while riding Wubak? What if he dies? Daddy is alright. Don't let my daddy race. Don't let him ride Wubak. Please... Please, don't let my daddy ride. Please don't let my father race. Is it you, Yea-seung? Yea-seung! Wubak, please. Don't be like this. Please come out. Wubak, come on out. Come on, Wubak Wubak! What are you talking about? I dropped her off an hour ago. Seung-ho! Seung-ho! You stay right there. I'm by the stables. I'm looking for her. You stay put. What the...? Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Seung-ho! Hey, come on! Let's go. Yea-seung! Go wait in the office. Please. Find Yea-seung. Come to your senses, man. Wubak is also gone. What? Don't worry. They're probably nearby. Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! For god's sake! Would she be okay? It's difficult although she won't show it. Won't show it? How can we know when we can't even know how a man feels inside. It's serious. This horse will run until it's leg is broken. Finally we have the opening of the 2011 Winners Championship. Seung-ho, you gotta do good. Boss, you're out already? No, it's not that... - What's this? - You scumbag. Let's go after this race. What is a safe one today? We have last year's winner, Cho Seong-hyeon on FIREWORKS With Cho's skills and condition at its peak... Block him no matter what, okay? The man's blind. He'll have no place to go if you block him. You understand? No, actually, drop him off the horse. Drop him. Drop him and step all over him, okay? - Bro... - Yeah, what? Am I next after Seung-ho? You know why Seung-ho became a loser? He became a loser after he let you have FIREWORKS. We'll start bidding on horse number 12. We'll start the bid on FIREWORKS at 10 thousand. From a German breeder, Sweda, with a record of 12 wins in 32 races... That's a great one for Seong-hyeon. Get it no matter what, okay? For Seong-hyeon? A jockey is over when he's swayed by emotions. You can't ride if you get sentimental. Stay focused! I want to be a great father for you and mother in heaven. Yea-seung, do you understand me? Many fans are here to watch the 201 1 Championship race. How many, do you reckon? About a hundred. Is that it? Then may be around 50 million fans. That looks right. Ms. Lee, how do you see this race? I see it with my eyes. Daddy... Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Wubak, are you alright? A jockey can't ride if he get emotional. Can't ride with sentimental crap in the head, okay? What's there to life? It's strong finish, isn't it? Hey, stay focused! To the left. Hey, Seung-ho! Do you remember? Life? it's strong finish! Stay right behind me. It's coming! It's coming! Seung-ho, Seung-ho! Seung-ho! Go! Lee Seung-ho! Go! Wubak! Bastard! That's interference! Wubak, are you alright? Stop Wubak. No! Stop! You'll die if we go any further. Wubak, that's enough. Yes, it's amazing. 30 meters, 20 meters, 1 0 meters, After I win the Winner's Cup, we'll have a huge wedding. Daddy! If the nail presses the nerves, then it's all over. You lost everything? I lost everything, too. Wubak, that's enough! No more! Stop! You'll die if we go any longer. Wubak! Daddy! Hey! Let me go, he's my daddy! Daddy! Lee Seung-ho! Wubak! Lee Seung-ho! Wubak! Lee Seung-ho! Wubak! This is hard to believe. This scene is probably the first in the history of horse racing. This is drama without a script. This is sports. Horse racing is life. You get up when you're down. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! Yea-seung! - Yea-seung! - Daddy! Daddy! - Yea-seung! - Daddy! Daddy! It's alright...
