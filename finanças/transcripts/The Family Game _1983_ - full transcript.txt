No, it's all right. - PIea8e don 't hesitate. - I ' m not at all. - Wc can have winc latcr, too. - OK. So, anyway, do you have any specific request for me? Well , nothing really specific as long as his grados go up. We've hired many tutors, but no one has really worked out. So his grades didn 't go up? That sums it up. I ' m sure you ' ll find out once you talk to Shigeyuki. He's a trouhled child. What do you mean hy trouhlcd? Don 't scare me like that. . . Dad.

It grosses me out too. 2 TEACH EH'S PET DORIS DAY I hear you rank 9th from the hottom in your class. Something like that. Who's on tho hottom then? Hamamoto, the douhle-hagger. - Is she that ugly? - It makcs you laugh. Huh. Ugly and stupid? Right. Ugly and stupid. So you are cute and stupid. I don 't consider myself stupid. I just don 't like to study. I ' m callin0 you stupid for saying that at a time like this. - Don 't call me stupid so casually. - Sorry. All l heard ahout you was your grades. What's your hohhy, teacher? Mine? To teach someone to learn. That's obnoxious. What's your hohhy then? To learn to study. What do you think of Shigoyuki? He's kinda cute. Cute?

Yes. . .? - I want his grades to go up at all costs. - l understand. I ' Il pay you if they go up. In eddition to the regular pay. It's like a hase pay plus commission. - Sounds good. - Doesn 't it? I think it's motivating for you too. But, how exactly will you evaluate? Will you look et his devietion score? Or his points on tests? Points vary depending on the ditficulty of the tests. What ahout his rank in his class? Say, I ' ll pay you 1 0,000 yen every time he goes up one rank. 30 ranks for 300,000 yen then? That's right. Do you really have that kind ot money? You cen 't say you don 't have it when it's time to pay me. I have a Certificate of Deposite at tho post oftice. I held it longer than six months. So I can cancel it. Mr. Numata... You promise? Yes.

Maybe he's heing ohedient. What a relief. Shinichi, you ' re a freshman hut don 't relax. Study hard. Otherwise, l ' ll get in trouhle with your father. I know. Osawa. - Your name! - Senuma. Tsuchiya. Ouch... Stop! Stop it! Open the door! Didn 't they make a movie out of this? Hight. I went to see it with your father. Who was in it? Let's see. . . Audrey Hophurn. What is she like? Is sho fat or skinny? She's vory skinny. - Do you want me to play something? - What about this? " I Could Have Danced All Night. " Ah, you ' ro early today. The other son is home early too. - What's the matter, Shinichi? - No more music. What were you playing? This. " I Could Have Danced All Night. " There's no way you can dance all night. - You need to study all night. - In million years. Either wash your hands or change your clothes. - Say, Mom. . . - What is it? When was your tirst period? In elementary school or middle school? - Why are you asking out of the hlue? - Do you still have it? Why wouldn 't l? Do you use tampons or napkins? I can 't tell when you ' re on your period. You ' re supposed to act differently, like you get cranky. But you never change. Have you trained yourself? - Don 't ask stupid questions. - Doesn 't the hleeding hurt? That's enough! Hey, you 're sneaky. You ' re always eavesdropping. So, tell me, Mom, when wes your first period? So, tell me Shigeyuki, when did your puhic hair grow? Isn 't it kind of lonely not having Mr. Yoshimoto here? It'd be exhausting it he were here all the time. Are you getting along hetter now? How do you like him as a teacher? You ' re always sleeping at home Iately. It's tough to he a freshman in high school. Hight? Hey, is that true? Not really. - Well, shall we go? - Go where? Where we don 't have to whisper. - You mean our car? - That's right. - You ' re not taking a bath? - Don 't worry. Let's just go. Hold on a minute. Don 't tell me you ' re putting on your make up. It's heen so Iong since we came hore togethor. That's true. Wanna tell me something ahout the tutor? I don 't know how defiant Shigeyuki is, hut... it looks excessivo. You haven 't seen it. I wanna see it just once. Just come home earlier. Come on. I can 't help it. lt's not like I ' m playing. Unless I work, we can 't send Shinichi to college or... Shigeyuki to high school. We couldn 't hire a tutor. But I ' m the onc who has to... That's your joh. It would 've heen easier it they were more good-natured. They are good. Shinichi made it to Seibu High. Other wives havo it a lot easier. Why do we have to sacrifice so much for the sako of our children? I wish l had them much later atter I got marricd. We had no choice. You got pregnant. I wish I could go back to that day. That sounds kinky. I wish I could learn jazz dance. DAY DU: Yutaka TSUCHIYA Yasuko Kl KUCH I Wake up! Hey! Hey! Still half asleep! Shut up, Yasuko Kikuchi!

Can I ask your opinion on something? Sure, go ahead. To tell you the truth, my hushand 's father is dying. You mean. . . now? Well. . . he's heen hed-ridden, and. . . he's quito old. So we think he won 't last much longer. It must he hard. So you ' re living with him? Right. And. . . well... When he passes away, how would we get his hody out ot the huilding? The elevator is too small for a coftin. I ' m not sure... The rooms are too small to hold a wake, let alone a funeral. We could hold a hig one at my parents' house. It's socielly awkward to hold a funeral tor my in-law at my parcnts' house. What in the world happened? What shall l do? Well... - What should I do? - Damn it! Sorry, hut my son 's home. Could you care ahout your neighhors, and not just about your family? I ' m pissed oft. Let me see what I can do.

I ' m sure that the English test l ' ll get hack tomorrow will he good too. What's up? You ' re taking a tough stand. There's someone who hates to see my grades go up. So, it's fun. Who is it? Hey, Shigeyuki, keep it up. I guess tho new tutor has worked out. We don 't know tor sure yet. Dut his complexion is hetter these days. Hey, Shinichi. I hear you haven 't heen to school. Now Shigeyuki 's doing a good joh and you ' re slacking otf. It's Shi0eyuki 's turn to study hard tor my sake too. Doth you and Shigeyuki hould study hard. Yes. I ' ll come visit. . . See you soon!

You sure get bullied a lot. - Dy whom? - Tsuchiya. He doesn 't liko me. You ' re so dumh. If that's the case, you should kiss up to him. How? Like by making him feel like he's respected. A guy like him? Why do l have to do such a thing? It's much better than heing bullied? Tagami, don 't you have a girl you hate? I sure do. In our class? Yes. Who is it? Come on. Tell mc. Masami Kimura. 'Cause she's protty? She's ahsolutely obnoxious. Oirls are scary. I had no idea you hated her so much. You don 't show it. You can do the same to Tsuchiya. You just need to grit your teeth and suck up to him a Iittle. You 're hein0 too true to your feolings. You know what? I perform occult stuff on her at home. Occult? So that she won 't flirt with the person I have crush on. When l comc to school evcryday... and see how its working little hy Iittle, I get so excited. So you have crush on someone in our class? Sort of. Who is it? You ' re so childish. Numata... I love you. Tsuchiya told you to do this. Why do you think that way? Oood morning. Oood morning. You ' re 0etting full of yourself letely just because your grades are up. It's none of your husinoss. Dy the way, stop harassing me. What's up with that magazine? You pointed out my cheating the other day! It's your fault. Some things should he kept quiet. Hey, are you sure you ' ro alone today? Where are your cronies? Shut up. They follow me and back me up on their own. I can take you on hy myselt. You 're so annoying. What the heck? l hato you too. Your grades may he up, hut l don 't want you in Seibu High with me. I ' m applying for Jingu High. As Iong as you know your place. Don 't come stink up Seihu High. - What's your prohlem? - You hastard. Wanna fight? You hastard. Why would l wanne go to Seihu High with you? Jingu High is just fine. - Wenna take a hreak? - Yes. Your mom has started to hring in the snacks pretty late. She doesn 't have to worry ahout what's going on anymore. - You ' re too optimistic. - Sorry. - Teacher. - What? Do you havo a girlfriend? - I do. - Is she pretty? Ot course she is. - Does she go to Jonan College too? - No. Are you going to marry her? Oh, thank you. Looks like perfect timing! So pretty... Move over the notebook! Oo ahead and eat! His grades have gone up quite a hit. Thank you. His attitude in class hasn 't changed. Does he go to cram school? He has a tutor. Really? He must he really good. He's not endorsed hy the Ministry of Education like you, though. With the way he's making progress he can aim for Seihu High. Well, the thing is. . . he says he's tine with Jingu High. He' ll definitely get into Jingu High. Mayhe he's not confident enough? He doesn 't want to go to Seihu High no matter what. I see. That's fine, if he's so determined. Let's see. . . Jingu High. That's it. Thank you. Dut, my hushand... What is it? I wonder if we should say Seibu High. What is this? Didn 't you all talk about this? Right, hut... What's this sunny-side up? What? What's up with this yolk? What's wrong with the yolk? It's too hard to do "Tsuck Tsuck. " "Tsuck-T suck? " You know l like sucking the yolk out. You like doing that? We've lived together for a few decades now. You should know what I like and what I don 't hy now. Sorry, I wasn 't aware of it. I can 't helieve you guys picked Jingu High without talking to me. We talked ahout it last night. It has to ho Seihu High. - He completely rejects Seihu High. - It doesn 't make sense. Seihu ranks higher than Jingu and... now his grades are good enough for Seihu High. Why not aim tor Seihu? Of course I said that to him too. You just can 't do a good joh. You ' re too lenient with him. Why don 't you talk to him thcn? You know what? If I get involved too much, it could turn into a murder case with a hat. That's why I ' m delegating this issue to you and the tutor. Why did you have your mother go? My homeroom teacher is a nag. You idiot, it's ahout your future. Why do you use your mother to decido your futuro? - I don 't like to talk to my teacher. - So what? You haven 't changed a hit. What are you doin0? Sit down. Why didn 't you choose Seihu High? - I ' m fine with Jingu High. - " Fine"? No one's preparing for the exam with such an attitude. You ' re supposed to he studying to enter the school you wanna go to. You and I have heen working hard till your nose bleeds. Right? Right. What's the matter? Where are you going? What happened? Say, Shinichi, where do you think they went? Why would I know? I ' m not spying on Shigeyuki. Why did you choose Jingu High? I like Jingu High. Switch to Seihu High. All right? What's wrong with Jingu High? It's hetter to he on top at Jingu than be on the bottom at Seihu. Why not he on top at Seihu then, huh? Hi, I ' m Tsuchiya. Shigeyuki, Mr. Tsuchiya's here. - Tsuchiya's here? - Yes. - Tell him I ' m not here. - Why? - Is he alone? - I don 't know. So, you are Tsuchiya? - Are you alone? - Yes. - Are you sure you ' re elone? - Yes. - Who are you? - l ' m a tutor. - What do you want, Tsuchiye? - Yo. What is it? I wanna talk to you. Can we step outside? Sure. That Tsuchiya guy looks weak. I thought he might he a typical bully. Why is he scared ot guy like him? Tsuchiya and Shigeyuki have heen in tho same class since grade school. When the road expansion forced us to movc, they wound up in the same school. That's the whole reason he doesn 't like him? They hoth know eech others deepest secrets and emharrassing moments. What are those moments? Well... Tell me. For examplc? One of them is called the shit pollution in the classroom case. What the heck is the "shit pollution case" ? Well, he shit in the room during class. - Wait, you meen he pooped? - Yes. Hc had a touch of diarrhca that morning. It qot worsc durinq class. He rclcd his abdomcn, squcczed his butt...anythinq to distract himsclf. Hc torc up his book and stulfed his mouth, but hc could hear thc slushy sound from his abdomcn. Hc tricd his bcst to hold it until thc class was ovcr. But his tcachcr callcd his name. That's when thc accidcnt happcncd. Thc wholc class was in uproar. Evcryonc startcd scrcaminq. Thc tcachcr tricd to scnd him to a bathroom, but... he couldn 't walk well hecause he had already pooped in his pants. Both Tsuchiya and he remember that incident very vividly. Would something like thet effect his entrance exams? There are many incidents like that. That's so silly, you know. PIcasc don 't tcll him I told you this. - Ilyou tcll him, l'II bc in danqcr. - O/ course l'll tcll him. - Come on, Mr. Yoshimoto. - O/ course l'll tcll him. - Lct's not. - l won 't. You promisc? Don 't tell the others that you heat me up. Why would l? - Hey. . . - Huh? How come your grades are up? That guy is your tutor? Sort of. He's awesome, isn 't he? He goes to Jonan University. Not a hig deal. Jonan University? Not a big deal then. - You ' re going to a cram school? - Yeah, I am. You ' re still into that hockey game? Sort of. Your dad used to play hockey, right?

I ' m so happy for you! Well. Shigeyuki, you should thank Mr. Yoshimoto. Hey, we can 't start eating. Thanks. Sure. What? Is that all? - Let's start eating. - Yes. Why don 't we toast? - Shigeyuki, congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations! Please go ahead and eat. It certainly cost me a lot, hut Mr. Yoshimoto did a great joh. Not really. You even went all the way to school. Thank you so much. Doth our kids were horn smart. Say, Shinichi, it's your turn next. Right? I hear you 're skipping school lately. That's not good at all . You should learn from Shigeyuki 's example. We're celehrating Shigeyuki 's success. We' ll discuss Shinichi some other time. That's not how it works. We rarely get together like this to talk. But still... - Mr. Yoshimoto. - Yes? Could you tutor Shinichi this time? No. A Jonan student wouldn 't he ahle to teach a national university candidate. Oh, roally? Jonan University is that interior? Honey! Listen, Shinichi. I 've heen focusing on Shigeyuki for a long time, hut... I ' m going to start being strict with you from now on. All right? So sorry. - Help me! - Here you go. Study hard, OK? I ' m counting on you. I don 't feel like going to a national university. What will you do if you don 't go? I may not go to any college. Come on. Don 't say that in front of Shigeyuki. That's not good. Please. I 've got so many things I wanna do. And I can do those without going to college. If you don 't, whet will your mother and l do? Huh? You ' ll manage, 'cause you guys are a couple, you know. What them? What kind ot attitudo is that? What's his prohlem? Just let it go for now. Today were celebrating Shigeyuki 's success. How come you ' re so calm? What is this? I see. Only l didn 't know ahout this. Isn 't that right? Hey, Shinichi, you already told Mom that you weren 't going to college? I already told her. What's going on? How come you kept something this important secret? Decause you ' re never there to listen to what l have to say. I listen to you in our car. But you comc homc late, and I thought I could wait till we were dono dealing with Shigeyuki 's exam. That's why I didn 't mention it to you. I ' m even thinking ahout quitting Seibu High. Why do you have to quit? You managed to get in and now you 're gonna quit haltway? Seibu High is a prep school to go to a national university. Don 't you get it? I have my own thoughts! You don 't think! I ' m the onc who thinks for you! Your attitude could lead to a murder case with a hat! Oh, really? Then go ahead and hit me with a bat! You idiot! Cut it out. What have you hoen doing? What have you hoen doing? What are you doin0? Cut it out! Honey, are you OK? Look what you 've dono to him! - There's a cockroach over there. - Cockroach?! - Shinichi. - What? Ow... Oood bye now. Let's see. . . Number 11 . Numata. Numata! Yes. Read it. What's going on?
