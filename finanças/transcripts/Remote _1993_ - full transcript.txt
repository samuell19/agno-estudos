Loved them. - Way to go, mom. - That's not all. They liked it so much they promoted me to associate art director. - What's that mean? - It means more money, Randy. It means you're never gonna have to fix that rattle trap bike of yours again because your father and I are buying you a new one this weekend. And that old Volkswagen out there, history. Maybe we'll buy a Porsche or something. No, no, no, no. A jeep. Oh, that'll be your dad. Hello. Hi honey. Good news. Well, the new ad campaign finally made it up to the creative director. Loved it. No, liked it so much they promoted me to associate art director. Featuring the Southland's number one anchorman, Wally White. - Good evening. Witnesses at the scene of today's bungled robbery of a local convenience store described the hold up as a comedy of errors. Which the robbers appeared confused and poorly organized. The suspects are still at large tonight, and should be considered armed and dangerous. - Hey. - Payback time, butt head. - My zero. - Quiet. You're zero's history. Thanks for leaving your window open, Mason. You got to learn not to be so trusting. Heres' the deal, I want to borrow this baby for a couple days. Give me the remote control. - I don't have it. Bull. - Really, my mom keeps them locked up. - Well go get it, butt head. - I can't. My mom's in there. - Then bring it to school tomorrow. - I can't bring a model to school. - Okay, lameo, I'm bringing the model. You're just bringing the control. And make sure the batteries are good too. - Listen, Ben, it took me four months to build that plane. It's really delicate. - Ever seen plastic melt? I have. Makes a real stinky black smoke. It looks real great, you know. As the wings wrinkle up, and the nose melts down to a flaming puddle. Hey, I'll show you right now over in my yard. - Randy? Who are you, Ben. What are you doing here? - Good evening Mrs. Mason. Randy's being real nice, helping me with my homework. - That's my Randy. Well, I'll leave you two boys to it then. - I think he's the cutest guy. - Let me be the one to fly it. I'll teach you how. - Don't worry, man. I know what I'm doing. - Now class, Jamaal has been working on his project for quite some time now. And today he's going to be demonstrating some of the properties of inertia. So please welcome Jamaal, excuse me, the Jamaalster. - Inertia, what is it? What does it do? And what's in it for us? We all know that objects in motion tend to remain in motion. And objects at rest tend to remain at rest. Now comes the latest development in the science of technology, the inertia mobile. Now Newton's first law of motion tells us that an object in motion tends to move in a-- Now the MC of relativity himself says that E equals M C squared. And Newton's third law says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. The inertia mobile's carefully constructed system of springs allows us to see the principles of Tony and McAnns-- - Mr. Mason, what seems to be the problem? E equals M C squared. Mr. Mason, please return to your seat. - What the. Mr. Mason, I need your attention. Please remain. Everyone stay under your desks. Jamaal, look out. Oh no. Everybody don't panic. Don't panic. The trio of would be robbers who have alluded authorities since yesterday's bungled convenience store robbery. The suspects were last seen driving a stolen white minivan. Randy, are you there? The school called. I understand you crashed a plane into Jamaal's science project. Needless to say, I'm a little upset here. When I get home young man, I'm going to confiscate every model in the house. It's time we established some new rules. Hi, you've reached the home of Brent, Marti, and Randy Mason. Leave a message at the tone. Randy, are you home yet? Call me at the office right away. - I've never known anyone who got expelled before. Hey, whatcha doing? - My mom's threatening to confiscate every model in the house. So I'm taking them to the hideout until things cool down. - Why don't you just tell the truth. I mean it wasn't your fault. It was Ben's. - I know. But if I tell on him, he'll just make my life more miserable. And plus, it was sort of my fault. Just help me get them there, will ya? - Okay. But you know, you're just making it worse. I helped you get them here. I gotta go now. - Don't you want to come up? - I got a game tonight. Are you coming? - Yeah. I almost forgot. Judy, you're not mad at me are you? - No. But I do think you're acting like a five year old. Hey, Del, where you going? This is a dead end here. Shut up. I'm hungry. I thought we was stopping for donuts. - No donuts, Lewis. Cops hang out at donut stands. - Shut up. Model home, opening soon.

I know about burglar alarms. I just got to check out where the sensors are. Now do it Ritchie. - Do it Louis. - Oh, okay. Get the ladder, bean head. - Well, well, well, looks like we're moving up in the world. - Don't touch anything until I check out the alarm. - That looks good. Hey, it's glued down. Yo, Del, everything's fake. - The whole joint's fake. - Water works. - Hey, Ritchie, look out. - Yeah, bring it on in. I got it. Hey Louis, why don't you help yourself to some cake there pal. - Oh. It's fake Ritchie. - Don't touch anything. - Oh, I live this cooking island. Come on, big guy, let's go. - Oh, nice living room. - Yeah, it's not bad. - No, no. - What, what? - There's alarm pads under this carpet. We'll use the ladder for a bridge. Come through here. No, no, no, through here. Ritchie, open the garage door and bring the van in. - You want me to close the door after? - Yeah, I want you to close the door after. Jesus, do I have to spell everything out for you guys? - You know wouldn't do much good anyways for Ritchie here cause he can't spell. - That's not true. I can too. - You cannot. - Shut up and do it. - You know, this I the first time I'm ever building a bridge Del. Although I have crossed a couple. - Shut up. - Hey Del, why don't you shut that off? - I had a cellmate who installed these systems. Once it's on, you can't shut it off without a combination okay. Okay. Give me the cigarettes. - Here you go. What are you doing? - You can feel the sensors under the carpet. I'm gonna mark the spots where it's safe to walk. - Oh this is fun. Careful Del. - I know what I'm doing. It takes at least 30 pounds to set one of these babies off. - Oh, nice bathroom too. - Ritchie do this. Ritchie do that. Next time I'm gonna get my own gang. No Del. No Louis. Just nobody. - This whole carpet is crisscrossed with sensors. Just step on the cigarette packs and we'll be cool. That's it. We're okay now. - You know, it's not so bad here. I think I'm just gonna stay. - Come on down big guy. Just step on the packs. Trust me. - Okay. Oh this is fun. Whoa. This is like a palace. - Oh man, no food. Oh, a cookbook. - Hey, Del. How long we got to hold up here? - I don't know, til the cops give up on the roadblocks. Three or four days maybe. - Three or four days? You know, I wish I never met you Del. - Hey, the feeling's mutual. If you hadn't left the money at the comic book rack, we would have been rich by now. - It was a new issue of D Man, I was just checking it out. - We're robbing the store. You could have stole it. - Hey, hey. Don't yell at him. That's my cousin. - Shut up. - I'm hungry. - Eat a candy bar. - I ate them all. - Alright, I'll go to the supermarket. Do me good to get away from you boneheads for a minute. Give me some money. - Hey, can you get me some ice cream? That fudge ripple? Get the new peanut butter crunch. I love that. - I'm walking.

Hey, you're those guys the police are looking for. - No, no, no. We're just carpenters doing some finishing work. - Oh no, Del, look, they got the army after us. - Yeah, we're busted big time. Let's get out of here. - That's not the army, that's a toy model. Randy? Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow, stop it. - Put in the van. Come on, let's go. Open the door, Louis. Ow. Ow. - Come on kid, get in here. We're not gonna hurt you. Just mellow out. - Stop it. - Put her in the car. - Hey, were you really the home run hitter for three years in a row? - Let me go. - Alright, I believe you, get in. - Come on kid, put the seatbelt on. Put your seatbelt on kid. Let's go Louis, let's go. Open the garage. - I know, I know. Uh oh, Ritchie something's wrong. - Oh, for crud's sakes. Come on kid, let's go. - Open up kid. Open up kid.
