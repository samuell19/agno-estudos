Man on radio: Missing person reports are up 48% nationwide. Nobody is asking why and you're gonna tell me that that doesn't matter? Woman on radio: Humans are part of nature. If nature disappears, so should we. That's what the mother- Whoa! Mommy, I'm ready! Okay. Morning honey... I'll be in in just one second. Hey, Daddy.. What's an angel lust? Angel dust? Angel lust. I don't know. It's when a man dies and gets an erection. Ew! Are you sure? 'cause I've never heard of that. Oh, well, if you've never heard of it, then it can't be true. See that? What mommy's doing? She's making fun of me. Yes. You! You too. You're gonna get it the worst... You are! - You are! - No! Morning! Coffee? Please. Here guys. Ooohh! What are these? Kois. It's a Koi. Japanese goldfish. 'Kay. Koi. Hey, that... is that, uh, tap water? Yeah. What'd I tell you? Bottled water only. I'm serious, Mary. I know you are. I'll be right back. What's wrong? Once your Daddy thinks he's right about something, there's no changing his mind. He would have caught us. Hey. Okay, come on, let's go. You see how the blood mixes? That's normal. Water should always mix. Now, watch what happens with the tap water. Here, let's take a closer look. Weird. There's something in the water that binds the protein in our blood. That's why we drink- - Bottled water only. - Bottled water only. Right. Smart. Mommy, look - science. Is that so? You know, there's something in the groundwater, it's affecting her blood. Isn't our blood made up of mostly water? It is, but there's a... contamination and it can be avoided. What if it can't? But we can. Now, what's wrong with you? Nothing, Danny. That's the point. Grace, you listen to me. Only drink bottled water. It's very important. Well water, groundwater, rainwater, all dangerous, okay? Stop it! - You're scaring her. - She needs to know this. Everything is okay. K? This is what the mother wants. Buh, can you just stop it with that gibberish? You sound like you're in a cult. Yeah, and you sound like you're a real scientist with all of this. And this all makes sense. Come on, honey let's go. No, I'm just trying to help. I might actually be able to save us. Danny, you can't save anyone. All right, good stuff. What's that? Nonsense. Mommy likes these. Come on, get in. Humming Mary? She's not here. I know where she is. Mommy Mary? Mary? Are you hurt? No, I'm just resting. Resting, around the... you're on the basement floor? I like it down here. Yeah, it's nice. Yeah, okay. This.. this isn't all right. Come on, we're gonna go to the hospital. No. Come on. - Don't... daddy, don't pull. - Okay. Okay, okay. I'm uh... let me call a, call an ambulance. The face. Mary, why you making that face? What is going on? That face. Mary, Mary stop that! Grace, can you go wait by the car, please? Please, please. All right. Come on! No, no, please. It's not her... It's not grace. Danny Come on. Why? You need help. No, you need help, Danny. The rest of us are fine. You... breath poison. You spread the rot. I'm just looking for my daughter. She wear her mask? No. You don't understand. Get out! No. Breathe See... The air is fine. You helped me. Good. Stop. Stop. You don't need your mask. You breathe poison. You killed everyone. My family. Everyone. Should've shot me then. Stop. Stop it. There's only one bullet left. I was saving it for me, but it's yours now blank boy. Save it for when you admit your daughter's dead. Hyaaahh! He's dead. [Humming...] [Grunting...] [Screaming] [Screams] Here. No. Drink. Fungus The Fungus... You've lost a lot of blood. You need water. - Is it clean? - Yes. It's not clean. Look, it's fine. It's clean? Mm-hmm. My resolutions were, though which way it would... I'd be gone from the hard place I was... [Coughing]... and leave the rest to fate. It's okay. I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you. Where are my clothes? I had to cut them off. You messed yourself. Mehhey! You.. You should use that bucket next time. There was a photo... there was a photo in my pocket, where is it? What photo? It's okay. Did you get my gun? Yeah, I put it in the closet. What's your name? Sam. Where are your parents, Sam? My dad died two winters ago. And your mom? I don't remember her. She stayed behind when we left. So you're all alone? Yeah. What's that? It's pine sap to close the wound and to keep it clean. It's okay, here. How old are you? My dad was 43. So, what's your name? Daniel. Okay. Where'd you learn how to do this? This might hurt. It's okay, okay, okay. Okay, I'm... I'm done. 'K, that should be good for now. And the bucket in case you need it. Can I have some water? It's so hot, right? Hot, right? Yeah, you're hot. There's an infection. If it doesn't drain, I may have to cut it off. Drain it. Please.. Hey Daddy, what's an angel lust? It's when a man dies and gets an erection. There's only one bullet left. Save it for when you admit... your daughter's dead... ghters dead... daughters dead. Your daughters dead. [Humming...] What song is that? Just a song I know. I've heard it before. My mom used to sing to me. I can remember her voice. I can remember the words. But I can't remember her face. Is that strange? I don't feel good. You have a fever. But if I cut your leg off you won't survive. Nice. No, she needs me. No No, she needs me. No, no, no. It's okay. I won't let you suffer. What's that supposed to mean? If... the fever gets worse and there's no coming back... ['ll cut your wrist and let you bleed out. It will be painless. You'd kill me. I'd help you die that's all. It's kindness. You might live. I hope so. Me too. I don't like being alone. I found one. Is... is it gonna fit? Yeah. Just give me a minute. Okay. How does it feel? Good. Good? Okay. Here. Mmm Hey. Doesn't like you. Look. You okay? Sam? Yeah? See that? See what? That. A tree? Looks like a person. I don't see a person. Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam. You okay? Every month? For how long? Along time. My whole life? Pretty much. It's part of being a woman, Sam. What part? Well, it means... you can be a mother now. Mmm It's a good thing. Any luck? Caught some flowers. They're in the trap. What? What? Why flowers? Well, a man will give a woman flowers to be... nice. Is someone trying to be nice? You see anyone else around here? I see my dad and you. That's it. Did you give flowers to Mary Grace? Sometimes. Did she like them? She liked them very much. Would you give me flowers? That's different. How's it different? Well, you're a little girl. I'm a hunter. Yeah, you are. So, how is it different? It was a long time ago and they're gone. My dad's gone now, too. I know. Well, I miss him less now. You okay? Yeah. Hey! Where are you going? Hey! You're overreacting. You need to relax. Where you going? Uh, checking the trap. I'll come with you. No, it's okay. It's better if I come. Okay, but you better keep up. Sam wait. Sam! It's not safe. Sam? Look what I got. That's smart to run off like that. You're not smart. I'm trying to protect you, Sam. I don't need it. That's mine. It's not a little bird like you. Hey, hey... here. I'm hungry too you know? Set your own traps then. Maybe I will. What's your name? I'm Jesse. Sam. You're a good shot, Sam. Must have lots to eat. If you come to camp, you can eat too. No way. Your dad would kill me. He's not my dad. No? Who is he then? His name is Danny. He's a killer. No, he's not. I can tell. Then, what am [? You're a hunter. What are you? I'm a friend. Pick that up. Have it, just don't steal from me again. I won't. I'm coming with you from now on to check the traps. Why? Because he's out there. He's out there and he's watching you, he's watching us and I don't know what he wants. So? So, I don't trust him, Sam. Are you going to kill him? Why would I do that? Because he said you will. What else did he say? He said he wants to be friends. Where are you? What do you want? Nice shot. Over here. What are you doing? Where's the old man? He's coming back. Like this? What? All right, I want those. You don't like them. Oh well. Nice place. Thanks. Is this practice? Practice? I don't need practice. I can hit a bird between the eyes. And then what happens? What do you think? It's brains all out, and we take a big bite. I'm joking. That's not funny. You get mad easy. No, I don't. I like you. You should go. I just got here though. I want to stay and talk. [Sigh] About what? Yeah. Talk about what? Hold it. Danny, calm down. Look at me. Don't do it mister. Look at me. Danny stop! What are you doing here? I just came to talk. Talk about what, hmm? - Talk about what? - Danny, stop! Stay out of it Sam. Danny. Don't need to fight. Wipe that smirk off your face. Mother wants us to be friends. You have a what? A knife? Show, show me, show me. - I wasn't gonna hurt him, - Yes you were. You were going to shoot him! No, just scare him. Why? So you can be mean? - Mean and stupid? - Screams Sam? Daddy! You're still looking for me? Of course I'm looking for you. I made a new friend. Show him what I taught you. Stop! Stop making the face. Grace stop. Stop it please. - Grace... - Danny, Danny... you were dreaming again. I was. I'm sorry I kicked you on the leg. It happened so fast. I didn't mean it. I'll live. Okay, good. What's wrong? I just feel bad for Jesse too. Don't. But he's all alone. Not everyone's like you, Sam. What do you mean? You're just... better than he is. But it's hard to be alone. Isn't it like that for everyone? I don't know. Well... I think it is. Hiding is where we find each other. Hey. What happened to your camp? Danny happened. Oh. So... he's not your dad. He's not your brother. Who is he? He's... Danny. Does he have you? Have me? Nobody has me. Who are you? You know who I am. No, I don't. I'm from the south. Come a long way. Where's your family? They died? It's not that simple. Danny says the water made everybody sick. No. That's stupid. Water's got nothing to do with it. It's the mother's voice. She calls us, we answer. She called everybody. Except me... and you. We're special. And Danny. No. No, he doesn't know the mother. He's like dead skin waiting to fall off. No, he's not. It doesn't matter. Danny doesn't matter. Mother sent me here to find you. And now we're here. I don't know my mother. Yeah. Yeah, you do. She's all around you. She's... love. So why are we still here if everyone else is gone? Well, your dad was smart. I was careful and we both got lucky. What about Jesse? What about him? Do you love me? Like you love Mary Grace? It's not that simple. Why are you here? Why did you ask me that? I want to know. Jesse said that the fungus is the mother's voice and she sent us here. Bullshit! Water of North Queen. Your dad knew it, same as me, that's why we're here. My dad saw this place in a dream. Maybe the mother spoke to him like she does to Jesse. Go get some water. Why? I'm gonna show you something. Give me a little jar, one of the small ones. Do you have your knife? Here. Watch this. Fungus attaches to a protein in our blood, travels to the brain, attacks the cortex. Water up north is clean because the deep freeze. Danny? Is that right? Danny? Is it clean? No. So, Jesse was right. - The mother wants us to- - Shut up! He's not- It's just a test. - I can fix it. - Your test - is broken, just like your leg. You know, you're just some kid lost in the forest, right? And did you know that you can't save anyone? It's not true, Sam. I can save her. No, you can't. Yes, I can. No, you can't. You know I can. You don't know what happened in the real world. This is the real world, Danny. Can't trust 'em. I don't have to. It's not in our goddamn home. People like Danny, thought they mattered. Mother Nature wiped them clean off the Earth. She left us behind, to be together... to start again. Me and you it's our truth. My dad told me to make my own truth. You will. Why'd you do that? You know why. It's love. So? There's more. I can show you. Mother wants this. So do you. Where are you going? Home. I'll chase you there. You're too slow. Faster than you little bird. Where you going? Where you going? [Screams] Stop. Get off me. Go! Easy Sam. It's okay. Stop it! That's enough. Give me the knife. Just give me the knife. Jesse, I mean it. - Hey! - No! Danny, no! You okay? I don't want to be alone. Don't! Oh, yeah! That's a good boy. Hi. Hello! I love you! Hi!
