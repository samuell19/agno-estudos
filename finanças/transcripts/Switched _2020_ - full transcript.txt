Katie Sharp. Will she be the new face of Glam Slam's? Cassandra, I'm ready. Just a minute. You have to go to school! ♪ Dear baby bird ♪ ♪ Dear sparrow ♪ That was beautiful, honey. Juilliard would be crazy not to enroll you. Mom, I can't do it, I'm so stressed out. You can do it. You earned this because you sent them an incredible audition. Ok, but that was a recording and I can't have a music career behind a curtain. We're working on it. I almost got the curtain open. I'll be the only person in the symphony that's in a box. People gonna say, oh who's the amazing guitarist in the box? You're not gonna be in a box. It's just stage fright. Yeah, but it feels like I'm gonna throw up. Like my stomach is turning inside out. Your talent's too beautiful not to share. It's a gift trying to erupt out of you. Yeah, but it won't be the only thing erupting out of me. Oh I have to work late tonight. Clay will pick you up or you can take the bus. Thats humiliating. I'm a junior. And good thing New York has subways, you won't have to worry about driving or a car. Oh we are gonna miss you so much when you go to Juilliard. Don't worry, at this rate I won't be going anyway. Thousands of people audition for Julliard and only a handful get in. Besides if I don't get the scholarship, I can't go anyway. Just have to join Clay at the community college. Hey, don't knock community college. You'll get it, Cass. Honey, I wish you could play with your heart, not your head. Then it wouldn't matter who's watching. You don't have to be psych-ward mom right now. I'm a nurse, not a therapist, but I'll give you a penny for your thoughts. Cassandra, you're spin cycling. I wanna be someone else. Why, that breaks my heart. Who would you be? Someone who can play a guitar in front of people. Someone who can drive and actually have a license. Honey, you can get your license whenever you want. Whenever you're ready. Someone who can pay for college, and who is popular that everyone likes. with millions of followers. I wanna be like Katie Sharp. What? She has everything. She's popular, she's beautiful and confident in her life. Her life is perfect. Isn't she one of the mean girls? Yeah. I wanna be her, I don't wanna be like her. I hate Katie Sharp. We don't hate people. Besides, you don't wanna be one of the brad pack. And, honey, Katie Sharp doesn't have everything. Mom, she is everything. I bet there are things you have that Katie would want. She just needs to get to know you, that's all. Yeah, like what? Well, you have a beautiful heart. Well, everyone likes her. Did you hear what I just said? You need to love others as you love yourself. Yes, Mom, I know. As you love yourself. That's the heart of the matter. Okay, I'm sorry. It's just everyone always talks about Katie Sharp. Well, maybe You should talk to her instead of about her. Bye. Bye. love You. love You. Oh honey, you forgot your coffee! Thanks, Mom. How will we live today? Lead with love. Oh, your shoe is untied. Mom? Yes, you got it. Look at her. Oh, no, oh poor girl. She looks like she got her clothes from the dump. She should start a GoFundMe campaign. Oh I would donate. Actually it's an idea for video I wanna do. Kids who forgot to look in the mirror before they leave the house. That sounds good. I know. Oh Olivia looks so ditzy in that short uniform. - Hello. - I know. Hi. Did you guys see my blog on this new jewelry line I discovered? No, I must have missed that one. I'm sorry. Oh, I forgot my lab binder. I'll be right back. Yeah, okay. Literally nobody reads her blog. She just really wants to be like you. Yeah, but I hope that jacket's not real leather. Hey, babe. Hi, Hayden. So I was thinking maybe you could make a video about me being your boyfriend. You know, like me working out. Throwing the ball around. That sounds riveting. I'll think about it. Yeah, yeah, cool. Is he still trying to be in one of your videos? Like what cloud chaser. I dated him because he's hot nor to get him followers. Hi, Katie. Hey, I just wanted to wish you luck on your Glam Slam job. Because that's so cool and you might already have a career. These are designer shoes. Oh my gosh, are you okay? Yeah. Let me help you clean them. Don't touch me. Sorry, it was just trying. You can wear my shoes. I know we wear the same size shoes. because I watched your favorite shoes videos... Stalker! I wouldn't be caught dead in your shoes. Looks like someone forgot to look in the mirror when they left the house. We don't wanna see your face for the rest of the day. Or your ugly shoes. Did you wake up in some alternate universe where we are friends with Katie Sharp? I was trying to be nice. Okay, kids. Last time we talked about saprotrophs and how they help the process of decomposition. Decomposition is an important part of the life cycle. The change that one living organism has on another, creates room for new life. As you see here, I have beakers of milk and they all have different dates and are in various stages of decomposition. Yeah, very unpleasant. So can anyone tll me, why does milk spoil? Katie Sharp! Because you don't have it in a refrigerator. Who cares about being nice to her? Love your neighbor. She lives on the other side of town. She's not your neighbor. Cassandra Evans? The saprotrophs in the milk are bacteria. They're eating the milk. It's their waste that makes the milk smell bad. That is correct. Good job, Cassandra. Kids, if you're gonna be distracted in my class, you better at least have the right answer when I call on you. Oh boy. How's guitar practice? Don't remind me, the audition is coming up so soon. So I'm really freaked out. Want me to come over tonight, be your audience? Maybe I should apologize to Katie again. What? Do not talk to Katie Sharp - They're coming. - or the brad pack. The last thing you need right now is draw more attention to yourself. Bro, no way! No way. Oh, she's. Oh, no, no, no. Oh man. I can't really handle it. It smells like pig. I hate her so much. I despise them all Cassandra. She is not gonna get away with this. No, we shouldn't hate people. I said despise. Here, I scavenged these from lost and found. I'm going to the principal right now. No, no, please. It'll only make it worse. It's over. Let's go. Sis, I'm so sorry. I don't want to talk about it. High school kids are so mean. I can't believe they did that to you. Wait, how'd you know what happened? I watched it. What? - No! - I thought you knew. She didn't! What did you do about it? Nothing. You gotta stand up for yourself Cassandra. How would you know? You practically ran this school. You were popular. You were never a nerd. Cassandra, you're not a nerd. Stand up for yourself. I thought I was supposed to lead with love. leading with love doesn't mean you don't have boundaries. Love tells the truth. It's not OK what they did to you. But I don't know how to do that. Oops! Looks like someone got milk on their shoes. Dear God, please show Katie Sharp what it's like to walk a day in my shoes. Walk a day in my shoes. Walk a day in my shoes. Walk a day in my shoes. Walk a day in my shoes. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your kale smoothy's done. I have to go. Excuse me. You are not leaving this house without your hair make up done. It's unacceptable. Hey sweetie, somebody missed our five o'clock run this morning. Are you feeling all right? Yeah, that's it. I'm just feeling very strange. I'm gonna go to the doctors. Key's on the shelf. I'm sorry, didn't I just tell her she is not leaving house like that! Well, why don't you stop her? Oh wow. Katie Sharp, please don't kill me for driving your car. What are you doing with my car? Sorry, your parents gave it to me. What's going on? Why am I you? You have my face! Don't touch me! This Is impossible! I think I did this. What are you babbling about? Cassandra, what's going on? That's my mom. We need to get out of here. Give me the keys. Give me the keys! Sorry! Okay, how do I get my body back? I don't know, why are you asking me? Don't bite my finger nails. You're gonna ruin my manicure. This has to be some kind of hallucination or something. A dream? That's it. I need to wake up. Okay, okay. Wake up, Katie! Wake up, Wake up! - Okay, stop! - Wake up! Stop, that's gonna leave a mark on my face! Besides, what if I'm dreaming? I'm dreaming. Right, of course. Wait, Stop. Ok, okay, wait stop. I think I might know what's going on. Last night, when I got home, I was really upset, because of what you guys did to me. Okay, get on with it! I prayed to God to show you what it's like to be me. Actually, the exact words were, please show Katie Sharp what it is like to walk in my shoes. You're kidding. I'm not. I'm sorry. That is impossible. I don't even believe in God. I mean, if just because you don't believe, doesn't make Him not real. Actually, that's exactly what that means. Well, then how do you explain this? Okay. we really need to go to the emergency room. Oh, no, I can't miss school! I have perfect attendance. You're me now, dummy. What would we tell the doctors? I don't know maybe they've heard of something like this. People could switch bodies, don't you think you would have heard of something like that before? Stop! Sorry. What I mean is, no one's ever switched bodies in history. We would've seen it on the news. No one will believe us. Or worse. They will believe us. Why would that be worse? If people could switch bodies, mean they would wanna do experiments on us. Put us into a lab. They would put us in a peewee dish? It's a Petri dish. They would cut open our brains and look inside. I'm way too beautiful to be cut up into pieces. Exactly. We can't tell anyone. Then what are we supposed to do? Go to school. Pretend to be each other. I can't pretend to be you! Well I don't think we really have a choice. Just until we figure out what's going on. Give me my phone. And I can't show up at school in my pajamas. Okay, okay, let's go. What are you doing? I'm just getting my things. Why is your stuff in someone else's locker? Who's locker is this? Is this Cassandra Evans's locker? Stop! Cassandra Evans is digging through your locker! Look! Oh, I get it. Sabotage. We'll take care of her. What do you think you're doing? Lorena! I'm having a horrible day. Yesterday you thought you could talk to us and now you are in Katie's locker? I can't you. Listen to me! Excuse me. You listen to me. Us. Abby! Hey, Wait! Where are you going? Look, yesterday is over. Whatever happened between you and Cassandra is between you two. Leave me out of it. You'd just abandon me like that? You're supposed to be my best friend! Sup, babe? Oh, hello. Beautiful, what's wrong? Do you think I'm beautiful? Katie, you are the most beautiful girl in my universe. I have to go. See you at lunch then. What did you take out of this locker? Put it back. What are you doing? Meet me at the lockers after school. What? You must think I'm an idiot. I need to talk to you. It's really important. You don't understand. You still smell like sour milk. Now get out of here before I call the principal. I don't know what you think you are doing, but if I ever catch you doing something like this again you will regret it for the rest of the year. You are just looking for trouble, Cassandra. Cassandra, Katie, could please return to your assigned seats. I can't believe she didn't learn from yesterday. What should we do to her today? My milk samples have gone missing. So, we are going to skip to the next chapter. Can anybody tell me what mimicry is and the four types of resemblances? Miss Sharp? Miss Sharp, could you please answer the question? Oh, me. If you have time in your busy schedule to join us. Sorry. Mimicry is the similarity from one creature to another creature or objects that similarity gives an advantage to the creature in some way. The four types of resemblances are appearance, behavior, sound and scent. That's right. Miss Williams, can one creature turn into another creature? Like, could I wake up one day and be a cat or something? You laugh, but that is completely possible. It is? Yes, of course. Take a butterfly. Spends the first half of it's life as a completely different creature before it cocoons and morphs into a butterfly. If you didn't know that that was the same creature you would never think if that was possible. Could you put somebody's thoughts into That's not possible. Not yet anyway. Although, I have heard of these experiments that are happening where they are putting a computer chip into the brain to do just that. But we are many years and tests away from that being possible. Lots of lab work to be done first. Okay, let's turn to page 68. What are you guys doing? Oh, sorry, I'm walking too close? I warmed up your seat for you babe. You know I love it when you play hard to get! Did you get my text about. You can't sit with me! Hey, Abby. Looks like there's a glitch in the system. Sabotage time? Hey, what if we just all try and be friends. That is not going to happen. Don't worry, we would never be friends with you guys. You're like not cool, kinda losers. No we aren't! Yes, you are. Who are we talking about? I'm serious. Maybe we should just try to be nice to each other. Katie, aren't you a vegetarian? Do not eat that. You're the vegetarian, not me. You. Me. Outside. Now. Yeah, don't mess with us. One second. Okay! If you're going to be me, you need to do a better job at it. I don't eat greasy pizza! And I don't wanna be friends with you and what's her face. Stop making me look bad. I'm sorry. Stop saying sorry. Katie Sharp does not apologize. Right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry for saying sorry. You need to wear my clothes, you need to start acting like me. You need to look good. OK, I understand. But you have to be nice to my friends. You don't have friends. Well, You have to be nice to my friend. Fine. If you can keep it together and not destroy my reputation, I'll try to be nice to your friend. Abby. Whatever. No! Her name is Abby. If we wanna pull this off, you have to get it too, just like me. Fine. I'll be nice to Abby. But don't mess it up with my boyfriend. And also, don't touch him. Hey! Wait up. You didn't take any of my books home! They're heavy. How are you gonna do homework? Wait, how do we suppose to do with homework? No one told me to do any homework. Nobody gave you any homework? I always have homework! Cassandra has homework. I don't. You'll ruin my GPA! Then I'll give you the assignments. I already have homework. As you! Then copy mine from yours. This is your fault anyway. So you do believe me? Okay, let's get this straight. I don't believe in God. But I do believe this is your fault, because you said so. So, fix it. You can't drive as me. I don't have a license. Well, I do. No. You don't. I really don't want you to go to jail as me! This is ridiculous. Why don't you have a driver's license? I have social anxiety. I lose my nerve, and I get really panicked. It's the worst that I have to perform in front of people. Whatever, I don't care about your personal problems. If a cop pulls you over, you're gonna get me in a lot of trouble. Fine. Then how we get home? Wait your parents are gonna see some random girl digging to your room. I don't wanna get arrested for that either. Well but how do we get to our own rooms then? I guess we'll have to sneak in. Wait. What happens when our parents gonna tell us good night? Your parents say good night to you? Like, in your room? My mom does. Hey sis, Ready to go! He's talking to you. Your brother is Clay Evans? Yeah, Cassandra Evans. Clay Evans. I would have never guessed that. He looks so cool. Okay, don't forget you are me! You know? Maybe I'll be okay going back to your house after all. That's my brother! And you have a boyfriend! Hey wait, I'm coming with you guys. Sorry Katie, you're not welcome after what you did to my sister. Why are you talking to Katie Sharp now? You know who, you know who Katie Sharp is? I forgot how famous I am. She is. No, she's infamous. Yeah, she's awesome. Infamous isn't awesome, Cassandra. Famous is being well known, but infamous is being well known for bad reasons. Katie Sharp is infamous. Did she apologize? For what? Yesterday. What's with you? Well, she'd suppose, I mean, there was coffee spilled on someone's shoes. But that was an accident. Enough about Cassandra. Let's talk about Clay. You're like a legend at that school. Huh? You were captain of the soccer team. Highest goal count to date. Everyone still talks about you. Even Katie Sharp. Listen high school doesn't really matter after high school, you know? Look, you really do need to stand up for yourself against her. Today, Cassandra Evans totally stood up to Katie Sharp. And high school is everything. See you later, sis! Wait! You're leaving? I've got to get to class. Oh my gosh, I just saw the video Katie Sharp put up. Are you okay? What should I do? Should I Call the school? Call her parents? Sorry. Isn't that Katie Sharp? Sort of. Do you wanna let her in? Hi. We are pretty upset with you. I was about to call your parents. I'll go to my room. No! Cassandra, we need to deal with this. Now is the perfect opportunity for Katie to apologize and for you two to work this out. Oh, I completely agree. It was very big of Katie to come here. I agree. She is the best. Katie, You are my daughter's idol. Mom! I mean. Mrs. Evans. And it would mean a lot to Cassandra if you would apologize. It really would. Cassandra you are not helping. Katie? Sorry! Thank you, Katie. Oh, I wasn't saying sorry for. This isn't right! It's supposed to be the other way around. I hardly think that my little accident requires an apology. After what you did. Sorry. I didn't know that this would happen. OK, is it settled? Be kind to each other. If you learn this now, it will save you so much grief in the future. Ok. It's time for us to go to my, your house, Katie. Cassandra, you need to do your homework and get some guitar practice in. Can I stay for dinner? Can I sleep over? Sorry, not tonight, Katie. I think we need some family time. I guess I'm stuck here. I forgot my address. Press the home button on the GPS. Right. I'll go get dinner ready. Mrs. Evans? Can I get a hug? I need you to bring me some clothes to school tomorrow. Bring some outfits. Katie, your kale salad is in the fridge. Boy, this family eats a lot of kale. Kate! Your latest video outperforming everything. You watched that? No. But the analytics are amazing. I tell you what girl, you keep that up and you're a shoe-in for the Glam Slam job. A shoe-in. What video do you have planned for the night? I'm not Katie Sharp. Hey! Lame. That would gonna really confuse your audience baby or your followers, I'm not Katie Sharp. Seriously? No, This is rally hard to explain, but I don't wanna be that kind of Katie Sharp. Oh, boy. Here we go again. What do you mean that kind of Katie Sharp? You listen to me young lady. Katie Sharp is working. Katie Sharp has a video due on that screen tonight. I don't have anything planned. What? This is your job honey. I don't wanna be a bad, mean Katie Sharp. Answer your phone, okay? Katie Sharp is a very successful brand. Yes, it is. And your father and I gave up our jobs to manage your career. Hello! I know that it can feel sometimes you're putting on a show honey, but that's just our business. People love Katie Sharp. Yes and this was settled this last summer. it's a career decision and it's working. So, honey don't get caught up in your feelings. It's just business. Yes exactly. So I tell what you do. All right! You get yourself through the Glam Slam interview and get the job by being Katie Sharp. Okay! You do your videos including the one you have do tonight. Tonight. Listen to your mother. Listen to your father. Settled? Good. Cassandra Evans is a wonderful, smart, amazing girl and you should all be kind to her. I'm Katie Sharp and I approve this message. I'm Katie Sharp. I'm Katie Sharp. Did you bring the stuff? Yes, of course. It's right here. You didn't put any outfits together. You made my hair look so pretty. What are you wearing? We talked about this. Couldn't you have to do a better job at being me. I tought this looks good. I use those clothes to sleep in! Forget it, we'll talk about it tonight. I said no pony tails. And you have destroyed my manicure. And what were you thinking? Changing my Social password? Yes, I did. I deleted your mean video and I don't want you to be able to re-upload it. I know, and you posted a video. You can't be making those sort of decisions without me. Katie Sharp would never make a post like that. She does now. This is not a game. This is my business you are messing with! Tell me the password. No. Excuse me! Why are you wearing those ridiculous shoes? What? I, Katie wore these shoes last week! Do you see her wearing them now? No. That's because they are last week. Girls! That's enough. Let's leave her alone. You were serious in your video? You want us to be nice to her? Absolutely. Fine. Hello, Cassandra. Your hair is so pretty. Oh, and soft. I'd like you're vest, if you're going on a Safari or something. You guys. I'm serious, let's be nice. See you later, Cassandra. You're welcome for that, by the way. Maybe you can even have lunch with us. We're allowed to wear sweat pants now? It's a social experiment. Did you hear Jake's party? I know. I can't believe I get to go to a party with you girls. We're taking the Porsche, right? Yes, of course. You can not drive my car to that. This can't be happening. You told me to act like Katie Sharp! Yeah. Well, maybe you're too good at it. OK, Katie, you don't like being treated like that? No. No one treats me like that. Doesn't feel so good, does it? Whatever, Cassandra. Listen, I've been thinking about how we can switch back. What were you doing that thing before bed? The night this all happened. I told you. I prayed. That's the last thing you did before falling asleep? That's the last thing I remember doing. I was praying and the next thing I knew I woke up in your bed. I was reading this magazine. But then things get all fuzzy. Tonight, pray before going to bed. And I'll read this magazine. I'd better wake up in my bed. Me in my body and you in yours. What happens if we don't? We'd better put some outfits together, so at least you don't look stupid as me. don't putt my hair in ponytails. It damages it. I'll show you how to do it nicely. Come on! You're really good at this. Well, it's how I became a Social star. I thought you got famous for making fun of people. I started with makeup tutorials. I got really good at it and people started paying attention to me. Then on one day I made one post about a girl's bad fashion choice and got tons of views. Like more than ever. But whatever, the point is I started with makeup tutorials. Okay, I need to make a new video post and you are gonna do some VO for me. What's VO? Voice over. OK, what's the plan? Don't worry, I'll talk you through it. I've already got the video cut, I just need you to intro it. Just say what I tell you to say. OK. First you need to log me in. OK, when I hit record, just say, teens who left the house and forgot to look in the mirror. You should black out their faces. No way, that's part of my video style. You can still get your point across if you hide who they are. It'll work. Thank you. OK. Now I have a favor to ask you. Tonight is youth group at my house and I really wanna go. Can I go with you? What's youth group? I think it's gonna be a way for us to get switched back. How? Well, a group of us meet up and pray. Ahhh, okay, Whatever, I'll go if you give me my password back. Deal! I'll give it to you after. What are you doing at Cassandra Evan's house? How did you know I was here? Don't you live here? We tracked you on the Social map. Are you having a party without us? Katie this was one of your best posts yet. I loved that you blacked the faces out. 'Cause one of them was me. Sorry I'm late! Class ran over and my professor just lectures on and on. I don't think we've officially met. Right. I'm Katie Sharp. Your sister has told me so much about you. I feel like I've known you forever. Great, you can take a seat. Now I see why we are here. This party has a snack. Please grab a paddle. I'm gonna read a list of statements. After each one, answer using your paddle. Here we go. Everyone has the right to their own opinion. Everyone can do what they want. I'm your neighbor. What does this have to do with God? What kind of party is this? Well, Cassandra, you are my neighbor. Not just because we grew up down the hall from each other, but because we are people. We are called to love our neighbor with all our passion, muscle and intelligence, as ourself. I think my neighbors steal my newspaper. I think they drive a white Lexus with tan leather interior. Yeah, I've seen them. I mean, they are rich. Why don't they just buy the newspaper? My neighbors have a Mercedes 250SL. It's sick. I think their name is the Dearbins. How do you know Katie's neighbors? I think you might be missing the point of who your neighbor is. The Bible tells a story of a man who was attacked by robbers. They left him for dead. After a little bit, three guys walked by. The first one was a priest. He didn't stop to help. He was afraid the man might be contagious. The Priest didn't wanna get contaminated so he left him. The second man was a foreigner he didn't wanna get involved, so he crossed the road and kept going. The final man stopped and helped him. He not only got him to safety but her paid all his medial bills and expenses. the story teaches us that all people are our neighbors. Even people that shop out of dumpsters? You can't shop out of a dumpster, it's free. OK. It's about breaking down barriers. The first two travelers didn't stop because the man who was hurt was different from them. The third man stopped regardless of their differences and he saved the man's life. Take a minute and answer these questions. How will you love yourself and others this week? It was great to have Katie here tonight. She may be a pretty girl, but her insides are ugly. You think my, Katie's insides are ugly? Well, where your treasure is, your heart will be also. That seems judgmental. Anytime people are mean it's usually because they are insecure. I'm not. I mean she isn't insecure. And how would you know what Katie treasures. What she did to you alone speaks volumes. I can only imagine what she has done to other kids. You probably don't remember but when we were younger, anytime we would leave the house, even if it was to just go play in the backyard, dad would say, lead with love. It's one of the only things I remember. Why don't I remember that? You were just so little when he died. Family hug time! Okay. Hey! You don't have to stop. It's beautiful. No, I can't play in front of people. Why? I have social anxiety. Yeah, you told me? But why? Last year I was playing in a solo competition and this one judge just ripped me to shreds in front of everyone. Oh you got trolled. That happens a lot to me all on line. You just have to ignore that and get your confidence back. You've a talented girl. Don't let anyone take that away from you. Yeah, I'm also really insecure. Funny. That's what Clay said about me. What? You? No, no way! You can do anything. You're gutsy. Yah, maybe I'm a little too gutsy sometimes. All right. I did my good deed for today. Password. Please don't be mean as me. Katie, come on girl, you're late! For what? For what? For your workout. Come on, you're late, get up on this. Seriously. Let's go, let's go, push, push, push. By the way I got a call from Glam Slam this morning. The audition is going to be live. OK. That means that the audience is going to pick the winner. Okay. Are you even listening to me? Okay. What is the matter with you girl? It's like you aren't not even yourself lately. You're turning Your video late. You usually ride on it, ride on it. Come on girl. I think I'm gonna have a heart attack. That's because you have been missing your workouts. I think you might have a heart attack too. You might wanna slow down. I'm not gonna have a heart attack, I don't have time to have a heart attack. By the way they moved the photo shoot to tomorrow. Photo shoot? For what? You don't remember? I didn't forget. Refresh my memory, please? Never mind. Just make sure you're ready to leave this house by six a.m. in the morning. Six a.m.? Tomorrow is Saturday! Yes, it's Saturday, so we work harder. Come on girl, you got it. Race me to the wall. I don't wanna go into the wall. What are you doing? They have people to do that for you at the shoot. Oh thank goodness. I can't do this. Oh, honey! It's just like the shoot you did for the song shop. Do you remember how fun that was? I'm Katie Sharp. Yes, you are. I'm gutsy. Let's do it. Look at the fans are here for you. Are all those people here for me? Well, yeah. You are Katie Sharp. By the way, that milk video was brilliant. You liked that video? Glam Slam loves 5.4 Million views. That many people saw the video? Keep up the great work and you'll fit right in here. By the way, I'm Skyler Stone, editor-in-chief of Glam Slam. Hi. What is this photo shoot for? We're shooting all of the influencers. This competition is great for Glam Slam and our online presence. And I'm a shoe-in. Me? Well yeah, you're a huge star. I don't know what to do. Yes, you do, honey. I'm so sorry. I don't know why Katie is acting like this. Honey, not every shoot can be private. This is really stressing me out. We'll snap out of it. Katie, meet Christiana. Christiana is one of the most talented photographers in Europe. We flew her in just for today's photo shoot. Katie Sharp. Your reputation precedes you. Hello. Fantastic. Capturing her school persona! Now, wind. Honey, remember you have to face towards the wind. It blows your hair. There you go. Wind off. Okay, I'm just gonna go fix her hair for a second. I don't know what's going on with you, you are definitely not yourself. I think this might be a very good time to take that mother-daughter shot that we've talked about! This is just about Katie. All right, whatever. Okay, go ahead girl. Maybe stand straight up, honey. Sorry. I mean, thank you. Well, you're welcome. You're learning from the best. Still sleeping? Are you ready to practice? Where am I? I can't believe how fast it's coming. What? What's coming? Come on! We don't wanna lose all day. Lose the whole day to what? To practice your guitar. Mrs., mom! Are you feeling all right? It's just I can't play the guitar. No, I really can't play. OK. You wanna tell me the truth now? What? You can stop pretending. You know? How? You haven't been yourself lately. A mother can tell. What do we do? How do we fix it? We cancel the audition. You aren't enjoying yourself. Music is about joy, pleasure, passion! Not about stress, fear and anxiety. No, you should not cancel the audition. That's a really bad idea. You used to play all the time for fun. You loved it. But ever since the incident last year it isn't fun for you anymore. It's OK to not put yourself under all this pressure. You would do that? Of course. Do you still want this? No one really ever asks me what I want. What do you want? Let's go have some fun today. I'll get it. Done. Great! I can explain that. There's this girl, she's really obsessed with me so I saved my name as her contact. It's just... It's perfect. Really? It's metaphysical. Subtle. That was perfect timing, because we have a meet and greet at the mall. Oh this is great. Honey, who are you calling? You have been on the phone all day. Let's just have some mother-daughter time. I don't skate. Since when? Since always. Since the last time we were here, you mean? Size six? What? Size six, right? Why? I can't wear these! Don't be ridiculous. They have been on other people's feet! You have socks on. I wouldn't do that. Honey, I love that you painted your nails, that will help you not to bite them. Yeah, that's not a problem now. So, who is so important that you're calling all day. Just a friend. Do you have a boyfriend? Yeah. I mean, no. It's complicated. Well, I would love to meet Mr. Complicated some time. So, did our little talk with Katie Sharp help? Are you two getting along better? Yeah, you can kinda say that. You know, it is so true what I said the other day. About learning this stuff now. You're gonna say it's just high school and it doesn't matter in the real world. No, not at all. Cassandra, when I was in high school, I was part of the Cool Crowd. We were so mean to this one girl, Emily Ross. She had greasy hair and acne, the poor thing. We teased her mercilessly. I still think about it. Could you ever just apologize to her? You know, find her on The Social? Make things right? Well, after we graduated I wrote her a letter but never heard back. That's a good idea. The Social is a great way to reach out to her again. Thank you. You know what? I wanna get the drivers license. Really? That's great! And contact lenses. Wow, look at you, changing everything up. Yeah, I'm just trying to do something nice for Cassandra. Well, Sarah would like to skate. I could do it. Yeah, I told you you knew how to skate. The love of Jesus changes everything. Like water reflects the face... wait, wait, wait. - I wanna hear it. - so one's life reflects the heart. He is love. Therefore, I should be loving. If you think about it, Jesus came to earth to walk a day in our shoes. Hey Jake, I can't wait for the night. Have you seen your Social numbers? You're viral. Oh, really? Oh, yeah, of course. Thanks. Hey! Why haven't you returned my calls this weekend? Things just got real. Your mom is going to cancel your Juilliard audition. She is busy at the moment. Come here. Did you just hear what I said about the Juilliard audition? Your dream? Flushed down the toilet. Gone! What are you doing, talking like that in front of people? Hello, I'm trying to help you, your mom is going to cancel your audition. Why would she do that? Because I can't play and she thinks I'm you! I know I said I don't believe, but if this is a God thing, you better start praying. I like being you. You don't you miss your mom and Clay? Don't you realize what you have? You know what? I think I'm better at being Katie Sharp than you are. Here you are babe. When did you start eating cake? When I became the new and improved Katie. So, when can we get a video up together? I mean, I really wanna get my followers. Who invited her? She's gonna a lot of nerve showing up. Maybe we can find some spoiled milk somewhere. That's so last week. We're supposed to be nice to her, Katie, right? Because you're friends with her now? You guys are my friends now. I'll wait for you here. So are you going to vote for Katie on Glam Slam? I heard it's now a live interview. I can't wait to watch. Cassandra! Hey! Where's Katie? Over there. Hey! Why didn't you tell me about the Glam Slam live video vote! What the heck? Doesn't matter anyway. You aren't anything I didn't make you. You are nothing. I made you. it's my face. It's my life. You stole it from me! You can't have it back. It's mine now. We are leaving. I'm not going anywhere with you. Seriously, we are leaving. Stay away from me or I will cut off your precious hair. You wouldn't dare! Try me. I'm not scared of you anymore. Fine. If you touch one hair on my head, and I will tattoo 'loser' across your forehead. Right here. In big block letters. Go for it. It's your forehead now. Hey, stop this. Don't touch me. What are they talking about? This is dope. It's exactly what I need. Cassandra. Stop. Look around. Everyone is filming us. Let them. I don't care. Well I do, we're humiliating ourselves. You've already humiliated me, Katie. A hundred times. And if it wasn't me, it was someone else. Everyone in this room has been hurt because of you. You don't wanna to be videoed? When did they ever have a choice? You just did whatever you wanted and now that you don't have control you don't' like it! We don't care that you're humiliated. It's your turn now. You need to calm down. And we need to leave. I'm not scared of you anymore, Katie Sharp. You and these stupid girls who follow you around like ducklings. You and your little ducks. Yeah, like your loser friend, Abby. Who always wants to sit with us at lunch. The only reason that you're even allowed to be around us is because of Katie. You shouldn't even be here. I was talking about you! Don't touch my friends! Oh, yeah. Cassandra, We're leaving. Wait, Clay! I'm Cassandra. No. You're not. You're Katie Sharp. Dude, I just got a hundred new followers from that post! Me too. I'm still growing! Oh, yeah. I don't wanna be Katie Sharp any more. Good it's a whole different thing when you actually see yourself. You are a kind person. You lead with love. Whatever you were doing in there was not the Cassandra I know. I was just trying to fix it. Can you start it please. Oh boy. Well, well, well. Glam Slam called and guess what? They canceled your interview! What do you have to say for yourself? I don't really care sweetheart what she has to say for herself. And I don't know why you would either. You know what honey, I agree. Don you not care about your father and I? Do you have any idea how bad this video makes us look? I mean you've ruined our reputation. How do we suppose to repair your brand? Your brand that your mother and I worked so hard to develop in the first place. Not even Glam. What is it? It's Glam Slam. Not even Glam Slam approves of assault. Ken there has to be a way for us to fix this. We've wanted this since you were a little girl. Long before that. I can't lose this now. I mean we can't lose this now. Right. We're taking away your car! No, that's very bad, bad for her image. - What's she gonna do, right? - I know, I don't want that. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry, you're right. Okay. We're not gonna take away your car. No. I don't care. Take away my car. I don't care about Glam Slam. Have you either of you even thought to ask what I do care about? Because all you care about is your own agenda! You were perfect for this job, absolutely perfect for this job Katie Marie Sharp. You're right. I am. Because Glam Slam is for mean people, who do mean things. I am Cassandra Evans. We are all Cassandra Evans. We have all hurt or and hurt by someone. I am sorry to everyone that I've hurt. I'm sorry, I started a fight tonight. It's really easy to judge someone but before we idolize or bully them we should take a minute to imagine what it's like to walk in their shoes. Instead of talking about each other, we should talk to each other. That's how we should live. I am Cassandra Eva... I'm Katie Sharp and I approve this message. I'm so sorry. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for how mean I've been to you. And then I went into the exact same thing. I'm sorry. Stop saying sorry. So what do we do now? I have a plan. We really need your help. Hypothetically speaking if two people could switch bodies, how could they switch back? I prayed for Katie to know what it was like to walk in my shoes. And it worked. I've walked in her boots for an entire week. All I wanted was for Katie to know what it was like to be me. Which was really selfish actually. Honestly, I've always wanted to know what's it like to be you. Listen guys, I still don't follow this identity crisis you're having just love one another. Oh, we gotta go! So what do we do? I think all we can do is make things right for each other. Starting with getting your Glam Slam interview back. Coincidence? I think not. We have five days. Five days. Five days to learn the guitar. Isn't that impossible? Seems like anything is possible lately. What about the video? What are you going to make? I don't know, I need to think about it. But your last video was on the right track. I follow your lead. Next on the agenda, apologies. And one break up. I agree. I think he's only with you to gain followers. Yeah. Did you want me to do that now? No. I got it. Hey, Hayden. What do you want Cassandra? I hope you got the followers you needed from that video post. And I hope you got the fame you were looking for, too. Because unfortunately you'll go down in history as Katie Sharp's ex-boyfriend. Wait what? I'm breaking up with you for Katie. That's kind of middle schooler. yeah but I like kind of act like a middle schooler, so I thought it was appropriate. Bye! Hi. I'm so sorry I pushed you at the party. Abby. Cassandra, it's just that you, really taken this wanting to be popular thing way too far. I've gotten carried away in the past. but that is the past. I've changed. I am really sorry. I mean, you've just been hanging out with Katie Sharp all the time. You ditched me. I did clean spoil milk off of you. Actually, I've been a good influence on her. Come sit with us, you'll see. Katie has really changed. And she could use a friend like you. I'm so sorry Abby. All right, you're up. Wish me luck. I'm wishing you a lot of luck. Don't even think about sitting with us. We don't care if you're famous and everything. We don't want anything to do with you anymore. We all make mistakes. Even me. Looks like you found your new crowd. And that's where you belong, with the rejects! Have you ever taken a second to get to know those kids over there? You can call us whatever you want. We don't care. But we're not rejects or losers. We're friends. And I would never let anyone push them around. Like you pushed us at the party? I know. I'm sorry. That's why I came over here to apologize. I made a mistake. I really mean that. You're more than welcome to sit with us anytime. Who knows, you might even make an unexpected friend. Tough crowd. Yeah just give them time. Old habits die hard. I would know, I made them. Made them mad. I mean. What Katie say when you talked to her about the Glam Slam thing? She don't really wanna talk but I think we need to find out. Okay. Dad time. Katie! Sweetheart. What did you decide to do about the Glam Slam thing? We're patiently waiting, honey. You guys are constantly spin cycling. No, spin class is on Saturday. Today we're doing the Tracy Anderson Method. No, I mean spin cycling in your heads. Thinking about the same thing over and over and obsessing over it. Maybe that's because it's so important. To who? Well, to us. I mean all of us, the whole family. Look I know that You guys are really health conscious, and you know worrying about what you eat and working out which is great for your health, but also have you ever just taking a minute to think with your heart, and lead with your heart. Oh, honey I'm not good in theory but I'll be honest with you, you've become everything I have wanted to be. Please don not blow this opportunity because it doesn't hppen every day. I know that you guys don't watch my videos, but the last one I posted was really good. You might wanna watch it. I think you'll be really proud. That looks pretty fun. Oh yeah, it is. Come and join us, honey. Tracy Anderson made this routine up for you. Tracy Anderson is Katie Sharp's personal trainer? Seriously you're gonna keep up this whole third person thing. Weird. Bad habit. Okay. Let's do this. I think we should have her come to a private with us. I don't know if I could handle that. Well, we gotta burn out that kale. I hope Glam Slam likes this. I don't care. It's what I wanna post. I don't wanna cancel my Juilliard audition. Okay. I've been working on my song, I wrote it for you. For me? Really? That touches me right here.

Hi, I'm Katie Sharp and my first official interview for Glam Slam is featuring the very talented Cassandra Evans, who was recently just accepted to Juilliard. Which is a very prestigious music school, if you didn't already know! Thanks, Katie! And congratulations on being voted in as the new face of Glam Slam. So, my very first question is what is it like to walk a day in someone else's shoes? Well, we all know that old saying Do unto others as we would have them do unto us. and walking in someone else's shoes really puts things into perspective. Until then, I didn't realize how selfish I was. When your heart changes it changes your perspective. Well, how can my viewers do that? How do you start that discovery? Well, imagine what life is like for someone else. Put yourself in their shoes! Pick a person who you think needs some love. And create your own video. Show why that person is special. Record yourself in the first person and as if you were them. Like this, hi, I'm Cassandra Evans. I'm patient, kind and I am a very talented musician. I also have an extremely loving family. And I'm Katie Sharp. I'm gutsy, loyal and a killer dresser. Then ask someone else to do the same. Let's start a love revolution. Bye. Bye. We did it.
