What do you say to this gentle man? Do not say something? Handshake? That's fine! Goodbye. Very well, I'm coming... - What can I do for you ? I'm looking for a room. For a night? No, at least for a week. Maybe two or three. Billy Lee! It's 2.50 per night. We always make reduction for our permanent temporary guests. Very kind of you. - Put your name and address here. Billy Lee! Wake up! I was just resting. You have to work to get right to rest. Go onto 104 and see if everything is in order and if it is clean too. Well, ma'am. Go on! I swear I believe that boy has nigger blood in him somewhere. You don't have to go through all this trouble. It will not take a minute. I suppose you are a salesman... You might say I'm a social . I came to do what I can for the town. In the integration problem. Oh, that, but that's all over. The've got 10 niggers already enrolled in the school. They'll start Monday. Yes, I know. And do you thik it's right? No, I sure don't! And neither does nobody, but it's the law. Whose law? It's ok, come up now. You want Billy Lee to bring your bags? It will not be necessary. Thank you. Suit yourself. Right this way. Come on baby. I'm on fire. Stop Sam. You will tear my clothes. Please dear. Please. - Stop it. Anything you want just let me know. Thank you very much. Oh, there is one thing... What's that? Privacy. I 'd like to take care of my room myself. I guess we can arrange that. Good. We're gonna be friends, aren't we? I do not see the reason we should not. Stop that quarrel. Do you hear me now? Ah, look, a spy behind the door Sam Griffin, you haven't got the modesty of a hog! Why I have to? Do you want to talk that way to me honey? Shut up! See only what you get. Now you listen, Sam, I've got a new guest... right down the hall And he is a gentleman. So am I, but I can not help it I have a lot of sex appeal. I'm sorry. mrs Lambert... We will not cause any more problems... Sam, I'm gonna kill you .. M. Russell, I feel interrupting your reading, but the soda is served. Look you're naughty! Hi. Hi! You are authorized to make bussiness transactions? Sir? I give you two dollars and you give me a coffee and change for telephone. All right! I bet my glass, double or nothing. Just put 10 cents in the bar. You are the meanest girl on earth! Be careful, mister, she's about to give you problems Thanks. See you in school. Are you really the meanest girl on the face of the earth? That's what people tell me. They are wrong, you aren't mean at all. Thank you. - Do you go to school arround here? - Yes. I didn't know they had a college in Caxton. They don't. You're going in highschool? They do grow things fast here, don't they? I've heard of southern hospitality The question is. It really exists? Yes, I guess so. No, I mean, really. I just moved to Caxton and I'm anxious to meet some young people here. But I don't have any contacts. Is not it a sad story? Hi, Dad. I'll check you later. Late again? I'm sorry, Al. It's alright, Dad. How is it going, Tom? All right, I guess. I'm surprised. It looks like school will open without any trouble. I hope so. Goodbye m. Hymes. Goodbye honey. Nice having you work for me. See you later. Do you think it's all right for a girl my age to go out with older men? What? Never mind. Hi, Mom. I'm sorry, honey. You could have called. - I had a lovely roast. - I know. I am a terrible husband. Sit down, I'll fix you something. - What's wrong? - Well... It isn't anything, actually, but... I had a kind of funny phone call a few minutes ago... It had ....me Who was it, any salesman? No. Someone doing a search or something. Well? Well .. He wanted to know how I felt if my daughter sits in the classroom with a bunch of negros. What did you say? I didn't know exactly what to say... But I told him the truth that I didn't like it. Did he give the name? I do not remember. Cramer, Adam Cramer. Make sense, too. Best sense I ever did hear. Where is the coffee? Sit down, Dad, I'll get you some... To walk in this house you need permission. What's the matter with you? Does it scare you that there is someone in the town with guts? Are you afraid they will let you in? Look, I'm tired. Of what? To have the butt in the chair all day? - Come on, Dad! - It is true! Everyone knows that. That Rio floods the whole city. What do you think he do? Write editorials! It takes muscles and work to stop a flood... And that we have! The Great Black Flood! Stop talking like that in front of Ella! I guess that's what happens... When you get old and sick. They treat you like dirt...spit on you. Wait that you die. All right. Let's forget it. Rose, get my medicines. Your husband is doing his best to give me a heart attack. What about you Ella? What are you thinking about sitting in a room with a bunch of dirty niggers? Ella thinks the same way I do. She doesn't like it. But it's the law. Can't you understand? The law! But is that what you believe in? Good morning. - How is the social work come along? We've had a good start. Good morning lady. So beautiful that I need to kiss her. Is that the gentleman you told us about? Mr. Adam Cramer, mr. And Mrs. Griffin. - Pleasure, Adam. - It's my pleasure. I hope we did not bother you too much last night Not a bit. - Have you had your breakfast? - Not yet. We go to the Palace. If you want to join us, you're welcome, isn't it, honey? Yes, sure. Come on, Sam Griffin pays. He convinced me. It will still be hot. It's there, at the end of the street. It looks bad, but the food is wonderful. Did not you get very tired tonight, my dear? Sam... Right in here. How do you do there? Good morning, we will start with .. A piece of lamb covered with sauce and accompaniments. - Boiled eggs and coffee.And you? - The same. Make it three. Do not forget the syrup! Every time I say the same. - Where are you from, Adam...? - Los Angeles What a coincidence, it's Vi's home town! What a small world! How about that, honey, you two ought to be known. I was in California, on vacation. What did you do? I was pushing vans, the same I am doing here. - I made 300 bucks a day. - I take it you are a salesman? That's a fancy way to put it. Fix man will be more likely. Hey, I'm going to make a sale 20 km from here, you can come. I'd like. Your work sounds fascinating. What's your allignment, mr. Cramer? Social reforms. Are you going to stay long? Quite a while, yes.... and you? All summer. We like it here, aren't we, honey? Of course, Sam. It's a good place, real fine people. - Something wrong? No, I have a headache. I go back in the room and lie down. Wait. No, no, please, I'm fine. Don't get up. Is a leasure to meet you. We are gonna be friends, aren't we? I think you're friends now . I'll be all right, Sam. - What beautiful woman does not? - Very atractive. Wondeful woman! Really wonderful. I hate leaving her alone so much time. She kinda gets bored. If there is something I can do just... No, I'm only going to be away one night. It's the kind of thing that reinforces the couple, you understand? Where are those eggs? - Hi - You are the driver? - Sure. Do you know where is the nigger town? - Yes, sir. - You take me there? - Take me to 22 Redwood Lane. - You can go up. Come on .. - Good race pimperwind, as always. Beautiful horse. - Who are you? - My name is Adam Cramer. Your home looks like a good place to talk. What's on your mind? I think you'll be interesed You tell me all about, whatever it is you're selling... In a letter. - Keep on working on it. - Yes sir. Mr. Shapman? In fact I don't sell anything. Then what are you after? A little courtesy for one thing. I came from Washington DC to talk to you. - Washington? - Yes sir. D.C. - Let's go to the shade. - Perfect. Lovely place here. Thank you. So, what is it you want to know? Mr. I represent Patrick Henry Society. And we want to know if you are in favor... Or against integration. It's a stupid question. I'm a southerner. Sit down. Look. I was born and raised here. As all my falks. That is, you're against? Of course I'm against. What's the matter with you? I'll get right to the point. Well... Our organization agrees with you. We believe the new rules are a mistake... That made the government. True, a shame, but what can we do? Fight! We did. We lost. It's a law now! Whose law? I thought this was a democracy and I thought the democracy is based to the collective will of the people. Of course. And this is the collective will of the people? That the nigros are allowed to stay with the whites under the same roof? Study with them. Eat with them. Maybe even sleep together. Is it the collective will of the people, that niggers should be allowed to take over the world? Because that's going to happen. Do you think it can be stopped? With your help, I'm sure. Legally? Start talking, my boy. Good morning, Uncle Ray. Your cigar. How many times will you will pass this shirt? You want to be present, right? Integration of white and black what do you think? Shut up. And turn that junk off. What junk? It's music, man. I said, turn it off. Joey... I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just tired. Will you really go to the white school tomorrow? I'm not making you, am I, Joey? No, mother. Too bad I'm not old enough. I would't be scared. - Who is scared? - You are! Man, do you know what you ought to do?. I'll tell you what you ought to do. Get yourself a gun... And if someone looks ugly for you... You can talk. I don't think Dad would approve this kind of thing going on. I know mr. Shapman wouldn't approve this kind of thing going on in his car. - Good morning. - Good Morning. Would you step on, please. I'm not going to bore you with a long sermon. I just want to let you know that I know what you feel everyone of you. I know because I can see it on your faces. Be strong, children! Not only physical, but mentally. Let your strength be shown in meanless. You will win this fight. Not only for yourself, but for the whole community. Let us pray. Lord, in your mercy protect these 10 lambs. When they enter the valley of the shadow... Comfort them. When they fall, give them strength. When they despair, give them hope. And let them do Thy will. Amen. What are you talking about, Uncle Ray? I say that negros will make them kill them. Almighty God! Hey, Tom, come here. There are your blacks! It's an army, right? NO NIGGERS HERE! GO HOME! NIGGERS BACK TO AFRICA Hey, niggers! Why don't you go home? This is a white school! For white people! What's the trouble here? What do you think? I'll tell you something right here and now. Maybe tonight is gonna get hotter, for a lot of people This little town is gonna burn. What I mean is that we 'll gonna burn the conscience of the country and put forward the light that everyone and everybody can see and feel. This town I'm talking about! Caxton! People... today - something happened. 10 negroes went to Caxton highschool and sat with the white children. Nobody stopped them. Nobody turned them out . Do you know what that means? That you do not mind mixing white and black... That you did not fight to prevent that. I say, how can somebody fight against something he doesn't see? They kept away the facts from you. They cheated and deceived... everyone of you. They filled your heads with filthy lies. and kept you in the dark. So that when you finally do wake up I'm sorry, it's just too late now I belong to the... Patrick Henry society. Which is an organization... Telling the people the truth. And what I'm gonna tell you... Will make your blood boil. Because I'm gonna show you the way this country is gonna go depends entirely and wholy and complete on you! You all know, that there was peace and quiet, in the south. Before NAACP started stiring up troubles. But what tou don't know is that so-called "advancement of coloured people" is now , and has always been... nothing but a communist cell. handled by a Jew who hates America... And you do not even have the job of hiding. The Communists didn't waste a second. They knew only too well, my friends, that the quicker way to cripple a country is to fill it with bastards. And then give their millions to the Jews... For one thing. The disaggregation. And they went to the courts. Now judge Silver... Who is a Jew... and is Known for his leftist linings. Who said so? The record says so. Look it up. Abraham Silver for one thing belongs to the Quil and Pen society which receives the funds indirectly from Moscow. So what did the judge do? Directly authorized the integration of blacks in schools. Your mayor and the governor... could have stopped it, but they didn't have the guts! All right. Now you may think, if the problem... Whether or not to let 10 blacks go to school. That's only a small part I am in the position to know.. Why in Patrick Henry society... had studied the whole thing. The real problem, whether you like it or not. is if you're gonna sit back and let the disagregation spread through the entire country. That is an undeniable fact! That will bring only one result! The negroes will literally and I do mean literally... control the South! The votes will be theirs! and there will be black mayors and black policemen the way they do in Chicago and New York already! Would you like a black governor? Or black doctors treating your babies? If they find time that is. And that's the way it will be! Neither of you thought of it. By allowing the ten at your school. Let me ask you, Do you want niggers to take it over? Are you willing to fight to the last drop? Fight to victory? I'm willing to fight with you. Why, mr Cramer? Why? Because I am American and I love my country. and I'm willing to give my life, if that will be necessary, to see that my country stays free! White! And American! Look at that! - But what is it? - I don't know. - What is this? - I don't know. Let's get them Let's get out of here, quickly! Take it easy. You're not going anywhere. Are you looking for trouble? No, sir we're on our way to our house. Come on, please. We have't done anything. Who gave you permission to come here black? Do not you know that this is reserved for whites? We haven't do anything! You wander our street! Have you seen the black boys in the back? Dane, please. Please. Please. Well, I'm sorry. We'are going. That's what you say, but I think you're lying, nigger! I do not lie to anyone! You talk that to me, nigger? Come on, let's go... - Come on, take a step. - One move. Why? Who said? I say your miserable little toad! If you don't want to spend the night in jail, you get out of here. Now! Get in the car and get out of here as fast as you can. All right, what's going on here? Nothing, sheriff, just good citizens having fun What kind of fun? Best kind. - Attacking negroes. He's lying, we didn't not attack anyone. There seems to be different opinions here. Opinions have nothing to do with it, sheriff. The fact is a family was terrorised on the streets of Caxton What the hell, it was just a bunch of niggers! Who threatened them? Do you want me to arrest everybody, Tom? Well, okay, it's over! Last night, the law was broken. A young northerner named Adam Cramer delivered an inflammatory speech on the steps of the County Couthouse.. Hi tom, how is everything? - Hello berne do you know...? YES, I've had the pleasure... - What do you want? Nothing, just business. Do you post ads? If it is within our norms. Good heavens, tom. You're the craziest man I know. Does not meet our standards. I suggest you get hell out of here. No, no, it's all right... Mr. Mcdaniel is nervous because he holds me responsible. You are responsible! I'm sorry you feel that way about it, sir. Because we are fighting on the same side. See you later Bert. He has takin'in, hasn't it? Cramer may be young and he maybe an outsider and all of that, but... I recognize that it says some very sensible things. Did you hear the speech last night? Yes, I heard it And I saw what happened afterwords, too. Don't prove a thing, certainly the negro asked for it. The Negro asked for nothing. He was just passing through town. which is his legal right. Come on Tom, come on. You are just mad because it took a man from another time to give us a lesson. I was mad at the beginning, too. But there is no other option. What happens here has to stop. And it should end now. How? Attacking negroes on the street? If that's what it takes, yes. Do you know what you're saying? YES, I know what I 'm saying- but I don't think you do. I say we have been educated and it didn't take us anywhere. Now let's do it in their way. It's not a fight anymore, Berne. Law says we got to have integration. I believe in obeying the law. Cramer apparently doesn't. I do not like him. I do not trust him. And I will not post his stinking ad! Damn it, Tom. Are not you forgetting something, Tom? What's that? I own the controlling stock of the Messenger. And you're working for me. That's the way it is? That's the way it is. Who is it? Adam Cramer, your neighbor. What do you want? A cup of coffee and a little conversation, maybe. Just a minute. Hi. Hello. Sam asked me to pass. He said he'd be gone all night and maybe I'd keep you company. If not I'll go back to my room. I think that would be a pretty good idea. Is that what you want me to do? Yes Why? Look, I'm getting ready to bed... At 10:30 p.m. I thought you were a night owl. Please! Sam will be very put off with you if he heard that you wasn't hospitable to a friend. I don't consider you a friend. Unkind. Definitely unkind. I just wanted a cup of coffee. Ok. Why do you say that? What? That I wasn't a friend. I do not know. I'm tired. Is hot. I told you. The way you act, you're not afraid of me, are you? No. It does not have to be so rude. How do you expect? I do not know what you mean. You know, this town... It must be solitary... With the husband absent most of the time. We get along very well. Have you ever been so difficult, or has it happened over time? If you do not like my personality, you do not have to stay. Anyway, are you looking for? A cup of coffee. After that you have to go. Mr. Cramer, I didn't know... you were .. a religious man. You must admit that it is dramatic. Lynching? That's a fashion. Otherwise you wouldn't mind? What a terrible thing to say. These people like me. I am here to save lives not to take them. And I am the Empress of China! I know what you're doing here, but I don't know why. Who knows? Great times call for great men. You are a great man? Not yet. You don't want to talk about politics, right? You already know everything you should know about me. You despise me, but I am attractive to you, am I right? Isn't it? If you do not mind I'll take off my jacket, it's very hot here. Aren't you hot? You know, this type of bulbs produces a lot of heat. Notice the difference. Do you see this? At least five degrees. You are not very comfortable, right? You feel very lonely, don't you? I know. It happens to me many times. - I get crazy sometimes. Because no one feels the way I do. And it would be great to find a person... And be able to be with her. Not much, just a moment. Only briefly. Adam, no. Adam, please. Please, what? You want me to leave? Do you want this? You do not want this, you know? That makes it clear. We will not let Ella go to school tomorrow. We'll do nothing of this kind. Tom, what's going on? I don't know what you think anymore. I do not either. Ruth, tell me something. How do you feel about this question? I 'm not sure I know what you mean. The integration. I think it's a terrible thing. Why? Why? Because it isn't right, that's why. Are you in favor? Yes Why? Because I didn't know. I don't think I know really. One thing Adam Cramer has done for us... is made us face ourselves . But what are you going to do? I dont know. I'm not sure... I'm not sure of anything. Except this is right... And that we should take it. Why did you arrest him, Rudy? He is the smartest of them, then, will stay in jail. But you know he had nothing to do with the bombs. Maybe you know... but I do not. Hello, how are you? I must tell you that nothing of this is pleasing me, I supported it because I thought you were smart, but smart men do not end here. But I do not end here. This is just the beginning. Never underestimate the value of a jail sentence. Remember Socrates, of Lenin, Hitler... The bail is $ 10,000, what if I don't put up the money? Forget, I do not need your money, yet. Have I told you that? Where you're going get it? Free Adam I want to thank the rev.Gibson, and Mr. Carey and Mr. Donogan, for what they have done for me. Our friend, Berne Shapman offered to take me out of jail, But I refused. I told them.. Look here, people... They will. He's a good man, but he did not believe me. I want to say I'm proud, to show him I was right. Now we know for sure that the people of kaxton they will face all injustice. The sheriff thought I was the one responsible for the church explosion. I can not believe you spoke to seriously who put this bomb, not a member of Patrick Henry society. We got brains enough to know... To know what to kill a priest black and blow up a church... It will do nothing but cause us more trouble. It's good to scare blacks, But we must be very , very careful. - Right? - Yes, that's right. I am not accusing anyone, who put the bomb thought was acting right But he was wrong. I hope you have understood and that according to the rules of society. I do not know who did this, but I know one thing. There will be no solitary nigger with courage... To have enough guts to step in our school now. It's all over! Hello, Adam. Sam, how are things? - Ok , I guess. -Good. How have you been? Did you make good sales? I am glad to hear it. Is there something you want to tell me? Because I am... I know it's not your business and I do not want to bother you, But I need to talk about it, or I'll go crazy if I don't... What's the matter? Is gone! - Who? - Elvie is gone, she ran off! What happened? I do not know. I returned at 2:00, brought her a present, I entered the house and she was gone. Just a note saying she wasn't good for to me and to forget her. I'm sorry, really! Do you have any idea why she did it? I think I can guess a part. I did not tell anyone but... I consider you a friend. Before you know her, she goes out with many men, it was like a disease with her. Doctors have a name for it. Still, I knew I was a good woman And I thought maybe I could help her, And it's been 5 years. Now this... I think she got into trouble. What kind of problem? Men troubles. With some guy who took advantage of his weakness. What do you think? Could it be that? It is possible, but... But I can not imagine that the mrs. Griffith. It is not right? It was a man. But who? You! Do not come with excuses. I know what happened. It is an old hotel with thin walls. Mrs. Lambert heard you I will not deny it, Sam. I did not tell you before, because... I did not want you to suffer more than you already do. It's the truth. Blame me if you want. Look, I'm going to be franck, It was not my fault, I do not want to protect myself. I went to your room, just say good night, and talk, just talk... And I don't know what happened, suddenly, everything started to go wrong. - Do you understand? - I understand. I slept with her I admit, but you got to know this. No matter how much you blame me and hate me .. And want to shoot It wasn't all my fault. And there is another thing, Mrs. Griffin told me I was't the first. I mean, since you've got married there were many more And told me that there was no problem, because you would never find out. I'm forcing myself to tell you, but it's the truth! Liar! I tell you the truth.I do not lie You're fooling me boy You are a professional liar, you know how to exploit people's weakness. But you know what? I'll find her, take her with me and we'll be together more than ever. In a sense, he did me a favor, my friend. You know something? We are in the same branch, you see? We both are selling something. But I have more experience, and I see where you are making mistakes. And now these your mistakes are accumulating and soon you will suffocate. I read your speech. Not bad, you have technique, but you know what's wrong? You are too clever, you have no room in your head for intelligence. If you were smart you would be able to see that you started something you can not control. Do you think you are the boss? Wake up, the crowd is in control What do you know, you, poor man? Did you tell them to blow up the church? I'm sick of hearing it. Get out of here before I pull the trigger. How wonderful! iYou couldn't pull up the trigger if your life depended on it! Deep down inside, Adam you're guttless. You know you're a guttless. That''s what you're doing this: To prove to yourself that you are not. I will count up to 5... And if you have not gone, I will pull the trigger. One Two. Three. Four Five Do you see what I mean, boy? Of course you can never be sure. A business rule. Get away from me. No, boy, I'm not going. I think I'll stay longer You will not see me, but I will. I've always liked fireworks. - Ms. Grimm? - Right My name is Mcdaniel, I think we meet once in the newspaper... Are you here to stay, sir? Go back to the town and put in the paper Blacks surrender, no longer have to kill anyone. Mr. Grimm. I know you have no reason to believe me, nor do I expect you do. But I'm on your side. - Oh really? Please believe. I understand how you feel, I know it's hard. And I can not promise that no one will be hurt. Maybe they will. Do not know. But you mustn't give up now. Your children and the others, got to go to school tomorrow.Means everything. This is easy to ask - but what can you lose if you're white? My job, my house, maybe my family. Is that enough to you? Joey.. Don't try to stop him, you know he's right, so do I. We can not give up now. We'd better hurry. Everything will be fine. Thank you. - You have nothing to say? - What? You know very well, we have seen it and want an explanation. We are waiting. Please, get out of my way. - What do you want? - What he said, an explanation. Tell us why accompany a bunch of black niggers to white school? I don't think anything I do is any business of yours . We thought you was against all this, And when we saw you take them to school... We were kind of surprised, you know? So I think you ought to do some talking. What got you say for yourself now? Which of these blacks payed you off? It's rude not to respond. Who paid you to betray your people? Teach him a lesson now ! Why do not you get 10 or 12 more people, Carey? And you would really safe! Teach him, Bart! Shut up, nigger lover! It's good to ask questions, but do not know answer them. Where were you when the priest was killed, Carey? Shut the fuck up or it'll end up the same! Where were you? Kill him, kill him! I'm sorry, Amy. I do not think I was born to be a hero. Will I lose my eye? Do not call the doctors yet. I want to know. You already lost it, Tom. They did a good job, don't they? Daddy! I'm all right. It's all right. It would be better to go back home, is late. Do not worry, it'll be fine. I'll be right back. I'm sorry, my dear. Don't be. I don't care. It's the best you could do and I'm proud of you. I wonder why you did this And why do you think so, but I can not lie. I do not believe in integration. But I believe in you. It means so much to you that you risked everything. Including your life. I know that's right. Then, I will try to understand it. I will try with all my strenght, dear. I only ask you to give me a little time. I love you, my dear. Say it's not too late for us. It is not. And never will be. Maybe it's better to call the doctor now. Has four ribs broken and... And what? Internal injuries and... he lost his eye. - He was lucky. - Luck? Yes, in my time nobody did what he does. He would have been hanged too. What's the matter with him, anyhow? How can I face my friends? I've never been so embarrassed in my whole life. Shut your filthy mouth! If you want to save your father's like I advise to listen carefully. I'll tell you things I would not like to tell you. Those who have beaten Mcdaniel are desperate. Desperate, you know? And the reason... Listen to me. No matter the reason, They will kill your father if we don't do something. They will go straight to the hospital. And there will be so many that the sheriff will not be able to stop them. Listen well... If you want to save your father's life... This is what you gotta have to do... Now I'm leaving... They want us to open frogs, and I do not know what to do, not surprising. I do not know about you, but... I can not understand them. JIGS GO HOME Joey grimm is you? YES, it's me. I am Ella Mcdaniel. Tom Mcdaniel is my father. They told me what happened. I hope he is better. YES, much better. I would like to thank him, did what I had to do. Your father is good man. I know. Well, I have to go, the bell rings. Wait, could you do me a favor? Of course, if I can. It's nothing. See, I'm working in the warehouse and I have to pick up some things, Can you help me? I need to warn you. Sanders... - Tell you where to go. It will not take two minutes. It's just a little help. Right. Come. Come on. Wait, I'll turn on the backlight Good. All right. These are two boxes here. Okay. Miss Mcdaniel? Miss Mcdaniel? What is the problem John, he doesn't let you win? - It happened! Danny, we don't know what are you talking about. Say it. What happened? A nigger tried to rape a white girl. A black man named Joey Greene. 20 min ago. Ella mcdaniel, the man's daughter in the hospital. I knew it would happen! Precisely what I feared. Are we going to do something about it? Go get all members of society. Tell them what happened to school and they'll come. Go to school. I'll be right back. Danny, come back and gather as many kids as you can, pay a dollar each to guarantee. - This better works! - It will. Shut up, if you do not know what to do. But Mcdaniel will talk. Certainly, after everything you've done. - And what did you do? - End this thing! How? It's the last question I want to hear from you. Now I'll do everything, understood? Get out of here and get some people. Hello, Verne? Adam, I got some news for you. Ella , I want to tell us exactly what happened. I know it is difficult, but it is a very serious charge and we got to get out the facts straight. Do you understand, don't you? Ella, please! I told you! Why did you wear those pants at that particular time? Why I needed them. Why did not you ask for help from Mme. Zieggfield to do it for you? I do not know... I 'd like to leave. Very well, mrs Zieggfield , you are excused Wait a minute. Ella, haven't you anymore to tell us? All right, you can go. I called your home, but your mother wasn't there Do you want to call at the hospital? Perhaps in that case Mrs. Zieggfield will take you home. I don't believe any part of it, do you? I do not know what to think. If it were another girl, I'd say she is lying. But Tom Mcdaniel's daughter... I don't care whose daughter.. We both know Joey Greene is too smart to do something so stupid. Ella is lying. It doesn't matter now. A short story will convince any jury. Humbelboldt said he saw him lowered. We are defeated. Give me the sheriff,right away! Bring Greene. Hello,Rudy, Listen carefully Gather all your men and come to school right away We have a problem with one of our students. YES, one of the colored students. Ruddy we have a crowd outside! Shut the door. Do not be frightened, the sheriff will be here soon. Is nothing to worry I didn't do this, mr. Paton. I know you didn't, Joey Give him to us! What do you want? You know what we want! A black tried to rape a white girl in school, and we know it's there. You have 5 minutes to deliver them - if not, we will enter and get him Am I right? How do you explain this? I think someone took it to that. Adam Cramer? You are on our side, mr. Paton? YES, I am. What are we going to do now? One minute, Paton! Remember, no violence! We promised the sheriff that we would take him in peace We are not a pack, but citizens comitted. Say it. Say it. Remember, no violence. There isn't any need for. Calm down, you'll see how we deal with it. Come on, let's get the nigger! I wouldn't bother, mr. Paton I'm sure the sheriff will be late. Come with me, my car is back there. I'll take you home. No,is that they want to see... Joey Do you people want to talk to me? Are you Joseph Greene? That's right. Do you admit that you tried to rape one of ours white girls today? - No, I did not do that. - What do you mean "No, you don't"? I mean I didn't try to rape anyone. - You're lying, nigger! - You'll be still! We're all listening for what this boy has to say for himself. So you claim you're innocent. Is that right? That's right. Didn't anybody teach you to adress to a white man with " sir"? Now let that be your first lesson. Is blood on your mouth, wipe it all . What do you say? - Thank you. Thank you what? Thank you, sir. And now I'm gonna ask you one more time, boy. And I want you to think before you answer. You think really hard. If you tell the truth, you've got nothing to be afraid of, but if you lie to us... You gonna be in more troubles than you ever dreamed of. Were you in that basement? I was in the basement. With a white girl. Yes, sir. We should get him to jail now. You were alone with a white girl in the basement of the school. But you didn't try to do anything? Is that what you're saying? Is that what expect us to believe it, nigger? Spit up! Only a coward would strike a defenseless boy. Is that what you're calling me, Paton? Yes, that's exactly, what I'm calling you You're a miserable coward,mr. Shipman like any cheap bully in the world. And that goes for you too, mr. Adam Cramer. And everyone arround here! I did myself made me perfectly clear? Let's go back to my office and wait for the police. If you do not want to go to jail, get out of here Do you admit it? It's too bad, you give us no choice. Where do you think you're going, nigger? Hold on a minute. Hello, Adam. Ella? Like I said, you never can't be too sure of anything. Who are you? I'm Sam Griffin. - What do you want? - Nothing now. Then move aside. We have an important bussiness to attend to. What kind of bussiness, mr. Shipman? You both two seem to have something to do with this boy. Look, Griffin, I don't know who you think you are and why you bring this girl here. Because maybe there is something you want to hear. And this will affect the business you're on. Tell them mrs Mcdaniel. Tell them what you told me. It was a lie! What's that? What are you talking about? It was a lie. Everything I said about Joey. All of it. What the devil you mean? She mean the father sent her to defend the nigger, that's what she is doing! Listen here to me. Why would a girl go ahead and tell a story like that ? She was put forced by your good friend, Mr. Cramer. This guy is crazy. Shut up! You go on! Your boy was going desperate, mr Shipman. He was on the verge of losing everything he built up. So he threatened the girl, told her he was going to kill his father. Don't listen to him, That man is crazy. Is that right, girl? He promised me that there will be any problems, that nothing would happen to the boy, except he maybe expelled. I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean this ever happened! Eve, go back to the car, everything will be all right. Ellen... Now I will tell everyone who you are that they may take him captive and justice be done, but not true. You lynch the boy, you know as well as I do. And I know all your life. I would say that everything went well, not was our personal problem. But you're wrong, began to lose influence soon after achieving it. Nobody has this power that you believed, mister Cramer. Lies. Lies! I swear to God that this man lies! Are you all crazy? Tell them the truth, come on! All about your jew wife , maybe they 'll like to hear about it? Tell them about the nigger women you kissed on the mouth. I've got proof, you hear what I'm saying? You don't think for a minute you're fooling these people,do you? Because if you do, you're wrong, They are too smart. They're with me, Griffin! They laugh at you, because you are nothing. Folks, You believe that you scared us... We aren't gonna give up now. Not now! No sir, not ever. You hear that, Griffin? Paton, you hear what I'm saying? See, speak, you will hear. A meeting tonight at the palace cafe at 7:30. Paton, it would be nice if you heard this, You can not stop justice in Caxton, whatever you do. This is just the beginning! Only the beginning! Adam Cramer, Boy.. You will spot your grass pants if you do not get up. Come on. That's better. I think you ended up in this city, right? If you hurry, you can still catch the bus. If you need money, I can... Are you sure? I almost forgot. It belongs to you. I wouldn't want to steal a boy.
