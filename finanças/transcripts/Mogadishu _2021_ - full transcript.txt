IN THE 1980s, SOUTH KOREA WAS NOT YET ACCEPTED AS A MEMBER OF THE UN. AFRICA, WHICH HAS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF MEMBER STATES IN THE UN, WAS THE ARENA FOR THE DIPLOMATIC WAR BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS. IN 1987, THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT SENT ITS DIPLOMATS TO MOGADISHU, THE CAPITAL OF SOMALIA. 1990, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SOMALIA Where the hell is he? Line everyone up for a photo. Make sure our faces are visible. He's not here, what do we do? Don't be too obvious, but play for some time. They're late for a meeting. You tell them. - He's here. - Where? Of all the things to forget! I'm sorry. Here it is. Just open the door next time. Swama! This will go out in a press release in Seoul, so make sure the flags are in the photo. And the university signboard! All right everyone, look at the camera! One... Two... Everybody, cheese! What are you doing? Go back to the line! Back to the line! Careful with that. What are you doing? A present from my husband. - Take it away. - It's a present from my husband. Let go of me! No! Where are they? Taxi! Taxi! They're not here yet? Welcome sir. Taxi? Back off. Taxi? Go fast! Taxi! You! Flight... Flight good? Good? Welcome Somali. Me! Best, best driver! Leave me alone, damn it! Hey! Taxi, sir! Come, come! Bruce Lee! I like! I like! Come, come! Come Bruce Lee! Come! Come! - Fine. Let's go. - Come, Bruce Lee! - Come! - Let's go! Oh my. Did you wait long? You came too, Ambassador? Welcome back, Counselor Kang. Let me get the smell of Seoul. Come here. It's been a year for you, right? Want a cigarette? I haven't had time to smoke even one today. The school event ran late, so now we're heading to meet the President. The gifts for President Barre? You're opening it here? Need to know what they are so I can explain it to him. Damn it, I told them to wrap them nicely. Wait, this is booze. Can we give this in a Muslim country? This here. It shows the Somali athletes marching in? What? I requested it since President Barre missed the opening ceremony. You didn't check? I just brought it here... You should check these sort of things. That's not my job. With so few staff, we all need to pitch in. Then why didn't you check with the Seoul office? I carried the damn thing back, and you... Watch your tone. Quiet! You two fighting again? We don't have time. Swama! We have to leave for the Presidential Palace now. So you... Take a taxi, okay? Good work. Bruce Lee! Taxi? Let's go! Ambassador. At last, meeting the president! UN membership! A promotion! Now you're dreaming. The gifts in the trunk, is there time to wrap them? Time isn't the problem. Where do we get them wrapped? That Counselor Kang, he should've taken care of it. What more do you expect of the kid? He's obviously got a chip on his shoulder. You said it. Secretary, I know it's hard working under a young officer, but don't make your feelings obvious. Sometimes it's really obvious. I'm happy to work with you, so I have no complaints. But what's so great about being an intelligence officer? He was sent here as a demotion. You think he likes it? Try to get along, for all our sakes. What's going on? I'm the South Korean ambassador! We are diplomats! No! You can't take that! It's for President Barre! You'll be in serious trouble! Internationally! Swama. Are you okay? I'm okay. You're okay? - You okay, Ambassador Han? - Yeah. You mind waiting here until help arrives? Yes, I can do it. I can do it. What do you plan on doing? What do you think? Getting this meeting was so hard. Let's run. I said, run! Okay... Ambassador Han! Ambassador, wait! Wait! My blood sugar. Diabetes, high blood pressure... And they send you to Africa for three years? Need a shot? Insulin? I'm okay. I'm... But we made the appointment three months ago. Why is it canceled? Your Excellency, you are the ones that arrived late. President Barre had another appointment, so he couldn't wait. No... We're 15 minutes late, and he had to leave? Did he plan to talk to us for only 15 minutes? Sir, please calm down. Who the hell is that? Hey, Ambassador Rim! Are you playing tricks again? - Sir. - Are you? I'm going to have to ask you to leave. No... President Barre's next appointment is with North Korea? The flag bearer is the two-time medalist in shooting, Bashinsky. Somalia! The Somali delegation is now entering. Getting their meeting canceled was a pointless act. It was just for fun. Oh my gosh. Look at these bullet holes. They could've been killed. Swama. Don't you have to go to the hospital? It's okay. I put on medicine. Wait a sec. Swama, this is a radish and an onion. Radish, onion. Okay? Okay. Take home. Grind. - Mix flour, okay? - Yes, yes. And you hurt... Put here. And sleep. Take this to your mother and brothers. Share. Thank you. So you just stood there and let them take the briefcase? They shot at us with guns. Didn't you see the bullet holes? You think you could've stopped them? Secretary Gong, I'm a trained professional. You didn't even call the cops? No point. It was obviously the North Koreans. Of all the armed robberies of diplomatic cars recently, has anyone ever left the car and only taken a bag? Exactly. The timing of it, and then their ambassador shows up. Must have been a leak. What, so there's a spy among our staff? What? You said there was a leak. How can you just blurt that out? Why blame the whole staff for the intelligence department's failure? I'm the only intelligence officer here, so you're accusing me? When did I accuse you of leaking intel? What's with you two? Must be the Minister. What do we do? Do what? Answer it. And say what? You're not going to report the failed meeting? Want me to buy us some time? What will that solve? Yes? Yes, Somalia Ambassador Han Shin-sung speaking. Hello? I can't hear you well, sir. Minister? There's construction here. I think it's a problem with the line. Is it the generator? Did I lose you? Hello? Minister! I'll call back later! There are some advantages to being in Africa after all. Secretary Gong, will you leave us? What? I've got something to discuss with Counselor Kang. Oh, sure. - Get some rest. - Yes, sir. Secretary Gong, he's more diplomat than human sometimes. There's a reason he hasn't been promoted at his age. No flexibility, that guy. He may be rude, but try to understand him. We're all one family. I guess I have no choice, since he's your little lapdog. Counselor Kang, what do you take me for? I can't believe you'd say that. Just 6 people in this embassy, and you're the only one I can really talk to. I feel so bad making you feel that way... - There you go again. - Breaks my heart, really. Ambassador. - This time... - That's enough. Can you really give me your full support? Who would I give it to besides you? No, no. Your favorite Korean cigarettes! God, bloody hell. The rebels wanted to send out a message, so I just interviewed their General Aidid and took some photographs of his guys. He just wanted to brag about how well they're adapting to their training and all that. Really? What did the CIA or MI6 say? Well, they don't reckon they're ready for civil war just yet. Very strange... If it's not war business, why... North Koreans sell weapons? Who? The North Koreans? This is a Type 68 assault rifle, in production since 1968. This is a Type 78 AK-47 rifle modified for snipers. Made in North Korea. The reporter who took the photo almost wet his pants when I told him. You're sure they're really from North Korea? Does it matter? I'm not the one writing the story. This is Africa. Africa... In a country where war can break out at any time, selling weapons to rebels is as hot an issue as they come. If that story runs, meet with the Somali foreign minister, threaten to cut off aid, and President Barre will have no choice but to join our side. More than anything, get the Somalian president's pledge to support South Korean membership in the UN. Good morning, Your Excellency. Good morning, Mr. Ambassador. Hello, Counselor. Thank you for coming this hour. My pleasure. Your Excellency, do you know that North Korea is arming the rebels through Ethiopia? That's the latest rumor? The guns in this photo, you know they were manufactured in North Korea? Last month, when a North Korean delegation came and promised to support your government, they even visited the arms factory here, right? But look... You request military aid from North Korea, then they support the rebels? That doesn't make sense. Ambassador Han, let's not get sidetracked on North Korea or the rebels or whatever. Just tell me what you want. North Korea has started lobbying ministers in other departments, to block your efforts at getting UN membership. But you know, I like the government of South Korea more than anyone and consider you my very good friend. So I was thinking... The government of South Korea needs to use their money more efficiently. For example, that program to take five of our tech students to Korea to train them... Isn't that program already getting good marks from both our governments? You'll have to bear with me, Ambassador. This is just an example. Now, two of my sons happen to be studying industrial technology in the U.S. Let's say Seoul adds $25,000 for each, so $50,000 in total for their aforementioned training fellowship. You want a $50,000 scholarship for your sons? President Barre may speak at the UN, but ask yourself who writes his speeches, and who steers his foreign policy? This so-called government is just a pack of relatives and thugs. How can I do diplomacy with them? Counselor, does the KCIA have any cash we can use? How can you ask me that? You blow the chance I gave you, and now you want more? But the North Koreans are lobbying, what can we do? If it takes cash to stop them, so be it. You know what that cash is for. You think you can just dip into our operation funds? You keep forgetting what kind of person you're talking to. What's with your tone? Look, wherever you came from, I'm your boss here! Look at me when I'm talking! I think you've got other things to worry about. Cheating on me right in the open. Hey! Hey, wait! Wait there! Wait! Is there really a leak? Ambassador Rim! Ambassador Rim. I want a word with you. What is it? Let's play by the rules. Ambassador Han. Maintain your dignity. How long will you keep up this sabotage? Sabotage? What about you, spreading lies about us arming the rebels? Is lying your method of diplomacy? Why blame us for that? It's in the newspaper with photos and all. Just don't get caught selling weapons in the first place. What is this bullshit? Hey, don't cross the line. We're just standing here, you're the ones crossing the line. - I'll chop your head off. - Not here, stop it. We were in Africa working our tails off 20 years before you. You think these stunts will get you anywhere? So quit selling out your compatriots for the sake of the UN membership. What's going on? Rebels! They started a riot, and now they're demanding that we release Islamic leaders arrested by the government. Can we get out? No. Everything's on lockdown. But don't worry. Barre will take care of this in no time. Damn it! No instructions from Seoul yet? No. The Ambassador and Counselor Kang are safe in a hotel, so don't worry. Try calling your family at home. What do I say? My daughter's studying for her entrance exam. I shouldn't worry her. Ma'am? I was supposed to phone my kids today. Sure, go ahead, don't worry. But are they asleep now? Yes, they must be. The Ambassador will be back, no hurry. While we wait for him, shall we pray together? Shall we? Nearer my God, to Thee... She knows I'm Buddhist! You think I'm Christian? Just pray to Buddha in your heart. Amen. We pray for the safe return of Deacon Han and Believer Kang. Let us begin with the Apostles' Creed. - I believe in God, the Father Almighty... - I believe in God, the Father Almighty... Oh no! Isn't that our driver Swama? What's he doing here? Careful! Isn't this... the mark of the rebels? What? Then is he a rebel? Don't be ridiculous. It's just a scarf. Maybe someone gave it to him for his wounds. But his neck is fine. What if he's really a rebel? We need to send him away. He can't be a rebel. He's unconscious, how do we send him away? If we're not careful, we could get hurt, Ma'am. How about calling the police? But if he's a real rebel, they might think we aided the rebels all along. But we didn't! At home they turn innocent students into Communist spies, you think that can't happen in Somalia? I'm just saying the political system here isn't developed yet. Watch what you say, especially in front of Counselor Kang. Okay. Who is it? It's the police. Listen. You can't... not come in here... Shouldn't we move Swama now just in case? Now? How can we carry him? Oh no! They're pushing in! What's going on? He is boss. Ambassador! It's the police. They say a demonstrator is hiding in our embassy, and they want to come in. What kind of bullshit is that? Is it true? Well... Hey. Who's the boss? We're looking for one of the instigators of the riots today, and we'd like your cooperation in finding him. This is Korea government land. You can't. Never. This. Damn, I'm too worked up to talk! Secretary Gong, come here and translate this. Okay. Your job during a riot is to protect embassies like ours, and I don't see a single one of you doing that! What? Can you repeat... Hey! You! Yes, you! You just trespassed on South Korean territory. You want me to call the Chief of Police? ID. Stop it. You stupid asshole! - Sir? - Yeah? Yes? What? Yes? What is it? I have something to tell you. Say it! - Honey! - Are you crazy? What a circus. Did you let him in? Where's Swama? Where is he? - No more dictatorship! - No more dictatorship! - Down with Barre! - Down with Barre! - No more dictatorship! - No more dictatorship! - Down with Barre! - Down with Barre! I, General Aidid of the United Somali Congress, address the embassies of each nation. One! The international support given to Somalia in recent years has been used by Barre's government to suppress civil rights, religion, and the democratization of Somalia. Two! We proclaim that our resistance movement is for the purpose of toppling the immoral and corrupt Barre regime. Three! Any foreign government or organization that provides political, economic or military assistance to the Barre regime is acting against the national interests of Somalia. Therefore, your government's decision whether to support the Barre regime, or to support the people of Somalia will determine whether you are friend or foe. Wait, do we know for sure this is real? I'll go talk to the guys at the U.S. Embassy. The... Okay... See you. Things often get stormy in this region, so don't panic. The radio! Let's listen to the news. - Down with dictatorship! - Down with dictatorship! - Drive out Barre! - Drive out Barre! Without any Koreans to look after, can't we pull out? Public servants can't act without an order. The CIA says it'll be fine. Should we believe everything they say? This is hardly the first time they've predicted war here. Think of Korea. Every day they predict war. At least in Korea, we know what info is real or fake. Over here, can we be sure of anything? Honey. Don't stay here. You go back to Seoul. And you? It took me 28 years to get here. Should I ruin it all with a month left? They can't demote you for escaping danger. We spent three years here during the most important stage of our daughter's schooling! What is this? My report went to Seoul today, so they'll do something. So I should leave you and all the staff behind? You're a family member, not a public servant. I'm calling the travel agent tomorrow, so get ready. It's mine! Take everything! ID! The travel agency's closed. No one's there. We need to find a broker for a ticket. Did you get cash? All the banks and offices are closed! We need to get dollars! Even the government ministers ran away, There's nothing we can do! Let's go back to the embassy. Down with dictatorship! Drive out Barre! Down with dictatorship! Drive out Barre! Honey! Duck! On the floor! Burn any document connected to the Somali government! Hurry up! TOP SECRET Oh no! Out of the way! What is this? All connections are cut! What? Even telex? Telex, too. We have the tape from the community function! - What? - Play it! Okay. Secretary Gong! The tape... Connect the line! Shit, why aren't you playing it? Assalamu alaikum! Hello everyone! We have come from far-off South Korea to be your friends. For the sake of Somalia's development and prosperity, we promise to become good friends as one family. Family members like friends, friends like family members... Remember that in good times or bad, we South Koreans will always stand by your side! The rebels have taken the radio station? It's a different frequency. It's a civilian uprising. Rebel forces haven't arrived yet, so it's not a state of war. You need to keep calm. The rebels are calling for the president's head on the radio, and I should keep calm? Do we have any kind of intel at all? The people in Seoul... don't even know what's happening to us, right? We're isolated here. Why... Why do I have to die in a foreign country? You're not going to die! Hey! Let's take one thing at a time. Sir, we need to request protection. You said the ministers ran off. Who do we ask? Stop! - Counselor Kang! Stop... - I saw it. Who do we have here? If it isn't the scary Korean diplomat. Assalamu alaikum! What brings you here at this hour? With a date, no less. - I want to meet Chief. - You have an appointment? Our phone all died. Well, that's too bad then. Because the chief is busy. How about deputy chief? Busy. In that case... I will see the... What's the English for "haengjungkwan"? Administrator. I will see the administrator. Nope. Busy. And since this is a state of national emergency, diplomatic privileges don't apply. You have no authority! I am a trained man. You're also in Somali government jurisdiction. My jurisdiction! So you don't call the shots here. Now, go back. Translate what I'm about to say. What? Arrest me! Shit, arrest me! I'm a South Korean Counselor! I've come to deliver an official embassy message! I'm a South Korean Counselor! I've come to deliver an official embassy message! You got a death wish? Go ahead and shoot, asshole! Shoot me if you can! Translate for me! Your commissioner is watching. Deliver this message. Your commissioner's name is on our embassy's contact list. If the rebels take our embassy, we won't be the only ones going down. You want to get your family out, right? Somali money is as good as toilet paper. And I bet you don't have enough dollars. So take our cash, and send us police protection. Okay? - He's a policeman! - No! He killed Swama! I'm not a policeman! Punish the murderer! It's not me! I'm on your side! Please! All these people came here to get on the evacuation plane. Even if you are diplomats, we can't let you board an aircraft unless it's been sent by your government. We have no way of contacting our government. All our communications are down. That's your problem. We have no choice. I know... But that plane. From Nairobi Airport, right? There tower... Contact Nairobi Tower can... What is it? Just tell me. The control tower! Can you try to contact the Korean Embassy in Kenya with it? I'm sorry. We're North Korean diplomats. Who's in charge here? We need to get to the airport. You can't go to the airport. Turn back. Travel restrictions will soon be enforced for all of Mogadishu. Travel restrictions? Then the airport will be closed too? Since the rebel troops entered Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, the gunfights between the Somali government military forces and the rebels have been taking place every day throughout the city. The future of the country is now bleak. And the security of all foreigners in Somalia... We have no electricity, water or communications, and no gas for the generator. And the defense chief who issues travel passes has fled the city. Don't worry. His nephew is still selling passes. Our informants have gone to get them. Our bigger problem is we have no food. I told you to secure food! No matter how much cash we offer, no one has enough even for themselves. What should I do? Turn off the light! Here they are. Rest easy and turn the lights on. It's the informants I sent to buy travel passes. Get ready to leave. There are rebels nearby. Can we talk inside? Come on. We'll talk inside... You son of a bitch! Watch! Money! Min-seo! Hey! Stop! What the hell are you doing? I told you not to hurt anyone. Go move the stuff! No more debts to you now. The kids from school saved your life. Now, you better leave, or my brothers will be back for you. What do we do without the last of our food and the car? And your insulin... Don't let our comrades know. We'll take refuge in the Chinese Embassy. We have no travel pass, what if we get caught? Better to get caught by government troops. At least they'll guarantee the safety of diplomats. So all of you pack quickly, and steel your hearts. From now on, our goal... is survival. Everyone come in. Go in. Go in. The only option now is to somehow get to the airport and board a rescue flight. We barely made it here. With the kids, we'll never reach the airport. Even so, we can't go back. Comrade Ambassador! There are Chinese here! There are Chinese here! Run away! Stay low! Keep going! Come quickly! Quickly! Stay by the wall. How much longer do we have to guard the South Koreans? To leave, you'll need money. What are you doing? This isn't right. They've got armed guards. Is this because you're out of insulin? What? Beg the South Korean bastards for help, and turn even our children into traitors? What's the point in surviving here just to get purged back home? You think I'm planning to defect? If there's trouble, we'll just take over their embassy. From now on, don't stop me if you have no other ideas. Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Ambassador Han! Ambassador Han Shin-sung! It's Ambassador Rim! - It's the North Koreans, right? - Ambassador Han! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! We're from the North Korean Embassy! Hey, hey! Stop, stop! I said stop, asshole! Ambassador Han, talk to me! What's going on? I'm the North Korean Ambassador Rim Yong-su! I'm here to see Ambassador Han. But what's your purpose coming here? We met a mob on the way to the Chinese Embassy and ended up here. The Chinese Embassy is that way. Turn back! There are women and children with us. Come out! As you can see, we're all unarmed! Unarmed? What are they scheming now? So tell us your business! Your business! That rotten scoundrel! They know why we're here, they're just humiliating us. Hide, quick! Please, at least take the children! Are you mad? Who told you to beg to the South Koreans? If State Security had secured our safety, we wouldn't be here! I'll rip your head off for saying that! Counselor Tae! What are they doing? Creeping around at night in such a dangerous place. In front of another embassy... But Ambassador. This could be our lucky chance. What? Has an entire embassy ever defected before? Don't get any ideas, just send them away. They have kids there, you'll just let them die? What about us? Go away! Just go back! - Someone's there! - We're all in danger with you there! Just go inside! Stay the hell away, you assholes! Come on out. Then what is it, huh? What do you want? Hey. Our embassy was attacked by armed rioters. That's not our problem. As you see, we have children here. Consider it as a humanitarian gesture. After all you did to us, you appeal to our humanity? You said not to sell out your compatriots. Ambassador Han. We have nowhere to go. Taking kids into the streets in a situation like this... What time is it? Have the kids eaten? Let them in. Prepare your IDs. Luggage on this side. You'll be searched before entering, so line up by family. I heard they're trained to kill people with their bare hands. The Ambassador's trusting Counselor Kang too much. You try talking him out of it. They've got kids, will they really try anything? You know North Korean kids all get military training? Come forward. Arms up. This is not what we agreed to. They are too many people to protect. What? Hey. Many people, no problem! Your job. Protect embassy. This is same. Well, you still have to give us more money. We are out of bullets. What a bunch of thieves. As you can see, we don't have much, but please eat your fill. Okay, let's eat. Aren't you hungry? Okay? Give this over there. Oh, Lord! You scared me. You shouldn't wander alone. Go back to your family. Do you have sugar? Sugar? Why? You want something sweet? Want a cookie? Not for me. Then who? Medicine for my grandpa... Medicine? He has diabetes? Your wife told my wife. That the rioters even stole your medicine. But Secretary Gong has diabetes, so we have insulin. It's fortunate. Well, not that Secretary Gong has diabetes... She shouldn't have told you. But thank you. Is it inconvenient being left-handed? What? You use your left hand. Not as much as diabetes. I use both hands. Don't want people calling me a leftist. But with the rebels in charge, why would they loot the embassy of the country that armed them? You really believe we sold weapons to the rebels? No reason not to believe it. You don't want to know the truth. Even if you did, it wouldn't change your mind. Just like we assume it was you who spread those rumors. I'm starting to learn that sometimes there are two truths. Anyway, since you are here, why don't you explain your position clearly? Do you think we're going to defect to South Korea? Let's do honest diplomacy. Honest, okay? You didn't come here to eat dinner. Just as a person or a nation has dignity, there is dignity to diplomacy, too. We didn't throw away our pride coming here. Okay. Ambassador Rim, I know you're much more experienced and capable than I am. But still, you're not in a position right now to lecture me. It's just the two of us here. Let's have dialogue, not a lecture. Let's speak from the heart. Are you even grateful to us for what we did? Hey, you know the water's cut off! How could you take a dump like that? That's not my poo... Ma'am, would you like to sleep in that room there? I'm fine here. I've got some ginseng liquor... You have it. No point in us staying here. Let's just go, quick! NAME: BAE YONG-SOOK YEAR OF BIRTH: 1935 CONVERSION CERTIFICATE Damn it... CONVERSION CERTIFICATE A conversion certificate. So you're planning to drag us to Seoul? Hey! Shit... Hey, did we ask you here? You came yourselves! Your guards all ran away, so you've got some nerve. You scoundrel! Honey, it sounds like trouble, shouldn't you go? - Me? - Yeah. I need to protect all of you. The guards. Get the guards. Damn... What is this, huh? What is this? Apologize, you rotten scoundrel. Or fight to the end. You shithead! A commie like you should be ripped to pieces and thrown into the battlefield outside, but, shit, I'm restraining myself, okay? What is this? What's going on? Comrade Ambassador, I caught these bastards trying to use us. To make us defect, they were forging conversion certificates. I heard you, so stop. Was this your order? Or did he plan it himself? Let's speak alone. If those people don't convert to our side, we're violating the National Security Law. What violation? You think we're plotting some rebellion here? Then why in hell should we be protecting them? What bullshit. The guards are gone, who's protecting who? Your police guard ran away! What's this? They charge for protection by the head, can we afford that? The conversion certificates were made without my order by our Counselor alone. As the person in charge, I apologize. We might've done the same. It's water under the bridge. That's not the important issue now. What will you do now? We've already abandoned our embassy, so we don't mind leaving here. And you? We won't last long here without guards. We need a way out, too. If we combine our diplomatic and intelligence capabilities, can we find a way? You think we can accomplish more together? Neither of us will make it out without outside help. If we try our Western allies, and you work your Communist allies, maybe a route will open. But it's not just up to us two. Will your Counselor and staff agree? That's my responsibility as Ambassador. Let's state our goal clearly. We're not aiming for reunification, we're just banding together to find a way out, okay? Let's forget this and go our own way at daybreak. Let's not get into a conspiracy with the South. What damned conspiracy? You think that ridiculous conversion certificate will be any effective? Your tone is a bit... Counselor, don't break the flow here. Let's proceed. Anyway, whether North or South, let's try arranging a route out through the big embassies. The Americans have pulled out, so that's not an option. The Italian Embassy is close, and might be fastest. Besides, Italy once helped Somalia under a trusteeship, so they have more influence than the US, and they still send rescue planes. We're not diplomatic partners with Italy, so will they help us? Not a likely solution for us. Look, if we go 500 km south to Kismaayo Port, we can take a boat to Kenya. 500 km, are you kidding? How will you go 500 km? You got a car for all those people? And gas? What if you run into rebels? Don't you even think? Hey, did I ask you to come with us? Why are you... Everyone calm down and look at this. Here, the Egyptian Embassy still stands. We can ask them if there's a way to reach Cairo. South Korea has no diplomatic relations with Egypt, so bad luck for you. We have a consulate there. Let's do this. We'll take the Italian Embassy, you take the Egyptian Embassy, and we'll see which way works best. What if... only one side is offered a way out? At least some of us will live. Don't open the gate, even for police. Okay. I'll pray. Don't, don't! Please spare me! What is it? Back up! Sir! Ambassador Mario is on the phone with Italy. - Not sure how long it'll take. - Really? Wait. You mean their phones are connected? It's a battlefield over here, a battlefield. Don't you even watch the news? Are you just telling me to die over here? Hello-- What did they say? I reached the Korean Embassy in Kenya, but they can't send a plane. Ambassador Han! Ambassador. So I heard there are 20 of you in all? Including children, yes. Okay, we do have a Red Cross medical plane. Right? But... Look, Ambassador. Frankly speaking, we can't take North Koreans whom we don't have diplomatic ties with, when we can barely fit all of our own people on the plane. So why don't we evacuate South Koreans first? What are you contemplating? Say okay. And the North Koreans? They can ask at the Egyptian Embassy. What if they say no? Just second please. - Just a second. - Okay. After all this, you'll give up our ticket out? If we'd made them defect from the beginning, they'd be South Koreans and they could all come. Exactly! Ambassador Mario. Actually, those North Koreans have defected to our side. I'm sorry... But as you can see, we're in no position to help. Can you at least help us contact the North Korean Embassy in Cairo? We want tell that we're safe. But all our communications are down. Well that... I can try. Can you also contact the South Korean Consulate General in Cairo? - South Korea? - Yes. What's taking them so long? If you'd said we'll go alone, we'd be on the plane. What are you thinking? They're not really going to defect. Will you take responsibility if it all falls through? Responsibility? Our seats are secure. There's a way we can both live. Need to try what we can. We should never have let them in last night. Right? Let's just think of getting on the plane. Ambassador. Well, the South Korean Government officially requested to our government to assist them. Okay so thankfully, everyone in your party will get a place on the evacuation plane. But the plane may arrive later today, so I need you to get back by 4PM at the latest and stand by. - Grazie! Grazie mille! - It's okay. Ask if they can possibly let us borrow a car. A car? We don't have enough cars for everyone. What are they doing? Ambassador, can we talk privately? Yes. Counselor Kang. We got a car from the Egyptians, so transportation is no problem, but if we drive out and run into some rebels like before, we're dead meat. We need to wait for one side to get the upper hand. Is that rescue plane some kind of taxi you can flag down? If you don't catch that plane, what'll you do then? Lower your voice. You're scaring people. I heard the Egyptian Embassy can't help you? You saw on the way, the whole city's a battleground. Waiting is pointless. What will you do? We're going. Have you got any extra books? Books? - Hurry! - I am hurrying! - Turn it! - Careful. Look out! Oh, Lord! What are you doing in this emergency? Hey kids, fill these with dirt. You're going to kill us before we even go! Why take it off? If you use too much, we'll run out. How will it support the weight? Look at this. This should go here, and then that there... So we can drive... Do we have to stick them inside? Just carry some sand bags. Hey, everyone! It's time to go. We need to get there before afternoon prayer ends. Get in! Everyone, move! Don't just stand there! Have mercy on us... Let's all meet safely at the Italian Embassy! Assalamu alaikum! Just wait a minute! It's okay, they're government troops. Give me the white flag. Damn... Give me that. Yes, that. It's okay, don't worry. A gun! A gun! Duck! What happened? Back up! Look out behind! Don't turn your head! Follow me! You okay? Shit! The gun behind us! Watch out! Get down! Hold on! Duck! To the left! Grab the gun! Push him! Watch out for the gun! - Honey, watch out! - You scoundrel! Grab the gun! Get the gun! Brake! - Step on the brake! - Honey, the brake! - Hit the brake! - Hold on tight! The gun! We're there! We made it! Honey! Stay there! Are you okay? - You okay? - I'm okay. Are you okay? I'm okay. Are you? Hey, we have no time! Take the white flags and follow! Take the white flags! Go. Run! Run! Follow me! Don't shoot! We Are Korean! Don't shoot! Keep out! Down! Get down! Keep out! Shut up! This is our country! Keep out! This is Italian property! - Behind the car! Hurry! - The kids! Duck! - Hurry! - Over here! - Honey! - Go quickly! Quickly! Everyone here? - All the kids? - Yes. You okay? Yes, we're all fine. Open the door! Stop! This is Italian property! We are Somali government forces! This is the final warning! This is Italian property! Get out of our country! Don't shoot! We are Korean diplomats! Don't! Get out. Come. Get out. Get out... Hold on. What's wrong? The rescue plane scheduled for yesterday arrives today. The Italian government brokered a temporary ceasefire to allow safe passage to the airport. COUNSELOR TAE JOON-KI I didn't get to say thank you! Are you going home now? Yes, we've been abroad a few years, so after reporting, we'll see our children again. Your children are with you now. When we diplomats go abroad, we leave one family member each in Pyongyang. If we don't go back, they all become orphans. Ambassador Rim? You have no diplomatic relations with Kenya. When we get to Mombasa Airport, our embassy agreed to give you cars and accommodation. Don't misunderstand our intentions, but if you need it, we can go together. Last night at the Italian Embassy, we were able to contact Pyongyang, and they made arrangements. Ambassador Han! I'm late, but thank you sincerely. Ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived safely at Mombasa Airport in Kenya. We just want the defectors, ignore those Commies. Get the defectors in our car. Take care now. You too. Listen up! We'll get off first! The North Koreans go behind us with those foreigners! Both countries sent teams, waiting for us outside. Once we get off, be sure not to acknowledge each other. Ambassador Rim, please look after them. And everyone say your farewells here. Let's go! - Quick! - Honey! Intelligence officers are here! Secretary Gong, we need to get off first! I'm coming! Director! - Hey! - Director! Nice work. The North Koreans? - What? - The Northerners. The Commies! Oh, he wanted to greet you, Director. Ambassador to Somalia, Han Shin-sung. - What about the defectors? - We're all safe. No, no... Over there! Hey, over there! Aren't those the defectors? Director, look. These foreign reporters are all here. We can't clash with them here. Let's talk there. - How can we leave the defectors? - Defectors? Director! The reporters' cameras! Damn...
