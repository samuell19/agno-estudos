Okay, this is it. This is what we've been working for. Some of you've been working for this day for years. Some of you, this might be your first year. It doesn't matter. Are you all excited over there, you little ones? - Yes! - Say yeah! Yeah! Parents, thank you for getting your kids here for extra rehearsals, so that we can have a show and not a recital. I think we're gonna blow the roof off. What do you think? - Yeah? - Yeah! Go on. That's it! I feel it coming! Lights and music, go. I live to dance. I breathe dance. I eat dance. Yeah. I fell in love with teaching right away. Just, uh, changing kids' lives and helping them, you know. 'Cause a lot of times, that's all these kids have. My mom is crazy. My mom is obsessive and she is passionate. And it's all for the education of somebody else. It's all for giving somebody the gift that she was meant to give. Denise Wall, who is, in my eyes, a dance legend. Being with Denise as a teacher and a mentor has really just changed my life, because I feel like I'm at my best because she allows me to, because she believes enough inside of me to be my best. She's one of the best dance teachers in the world. We immediately-- I immediately started asking her questions about, like, the body. Like, da-da-da. No, he has actually got a foot. He's got an arch. Look at this. Look at that. Like a living, breathing encyclopedia. My confidence really built up because of Denise. Um, and so when I saw Travis audition for So You Think You Can Dance, and we were really, really close, it inspired me to audition for the show. It was all the things that Denise taught me about respect, how to present myself, and how to kind of stay grounded in those situations that made me more successful on the show. It's incredible what she's done. It's incredible, the reputation that she's built for herself, in the dance world. I mean, everyone knows her for the training and what she's done with kids. And, you know, people move here from across the country to come train with her. It wasn't like this growing up. Because I always said, "Oh, I never wanna own my own studio. It's too much work, you know. Everybody else gets paid, you don't get paid." So I always worried about that because, you know, at a certain point I did become a single mom. At the point that I opened up my studio, I had three kids at this point. Yeah, we didn't have a lot of money, you know. Um, I worked all the time. I made sure my kids ate. Sometimes I didn't, you know. But that's what you do. You do whatever you do for your kids. Nothing was ever given to her. No one ever taught her these things, she literally had to go and find them and put them all together into this huge beautiful pot, and mix it up and serve it to everybody. There's so many people that look at me, and they go, "You're just like your mother." I'm like, "Stop it." Mom, I love you so much. Everything is always for you. I'm like, "I tried to sleep." They're like, "Yeah, you're not sleeping. You're just like your mother. You're not eating. You're just like your mother. You're putting everybody else first. You're working so hard. You're just like your mother." I'm like, "Shut up!" She taught me how to work hard. What's really important about, um, you know, the importance about life. She was a mommy and a daddy. You know, we would move from this house to this house, and, you know, she would go from this marriage to this marriage, and I would go from this job to this... I mean, we were just kind of... Everything was always a complete, utter chaos. And the only thing that was always the same was the studio. Well, she's... You know her. She's working like... She doesn't sleep for the studio. She... she... gets, like, one or two hours of sleep, so... If I didn't teach dance, my kids wouldn't be able to dance. I think that's why God gave me the gift. I think, you know, he knows what our journey's supposed to be. The company that I have now, I've been cultivating for a while. And they're one of my favorites. I have more kids that really want to do this for a living. If I say,"Jump to the roof," they're gonna do it. They'll do whatever I say. Because they know I love them, I love them not only as their dance teacher but, I mean, I truly love them. They're in my soul. They work... They work hard. They work hard. When I come up with new things, they'll try it. It's first step to the Dance Awards! All right. What'd I tell y'all last year when you got home from Nationals? When do you start working on Nationals? Now. No. The day you get home from Nationals from the year before. Here at the Dance Awards, this is the culmination of a year's worth of work. The kids go to Nationals having put all this hard work into it. Knowing that they could really take away with them a career. We tend to attract some of the best talent in the country because of the faculty we offer. For instance, someone like Travis Wall, who is an Emmy winner. And we have certain other faculty members who've also won Emmys and are doing really great things in the industry and really moving dance forward. Every moment that you're in front of these people, putting your name and your face out there, really showing that you want this. Because there's thousands and thousands of kids at the Nationals that they're going to. And it's the biggest event of the summer. Any studios who have qualified throughout the season, they have the chance to compete against all the other dancers who attended from around the country or around North America, and it's some of the best competition you'll ever see anywhere ever. Every ballet class, every ballet class, and every ballet class again. Every contemporary class, every jazz class, every hip-hop class, every class you walk into, it's your goal to get to Nationals. Okay. Pull back your hair a little bit. You look a little wretched! -Did you work hard today? -Yup. That kid, you know, she does it every class, she's given 200%, every class. I don't care if she's feeling sick, you know, maybe her body won't push it, but her passion to get it done is still 200%. Just don't let the drillin' hit you. -Okay, all righty. Thank you. -Thank you, Denise. Just keep on going through those corrections. I live in Texas, which is... It takes 23 hours to drive here, which is crazy. My dad, he works for Homeland Security. So he lives in Houston with my sister and my grandma and my great-grandma. And, uh... He does a lot for me and my mom. He pays all the bills, obviously. And, um, he's our rock. He loves me and my mom dearly. I mean, I think she's so brave. I don't know that at 12, I would have been willing to move across the country from my family. This is a very emotional situation with her living here and us there because we have an older daughter, Hannah, and that has been our anchor there with all of her activities in school. I can't leave her, so we've had to split. We call ourselves a bi-coastal family. So it's a struggle on our marriage and it's a struggle with our kids and the relationships. But, um, through it all we've continued to push forward in it. Here's the deal. I'm not gonna be at Hallie's house for Thanksgiving when she's 40 years old, and we're not gonna talk about what might have happened. If we had made that sacrifice and I had gone there, would something have happened? We're not gonna do that. I'm enrolled in K12. It's a public school in Texas. So everything's online. I associate with kids and teachers. It's just like a normal life, but except it's online. I miss school in Texas, but... it's like, sometimes I just think about, like, like, why, like, be like a normal kid, you know. I have this great life right now, so... I train probably 36 hours a week. Seven days a week. Monday through Sunday. And then start all over again. I call her in her sophomore year at Denise Wall University. You can mention her name and everyone knows who Denise Wall is. Yeah. Engage it. Spread that. Like, engage that, okay? You have to think that's your face right now. Dance means absolutely the world to me. I mean, that's all I do every day. That's all I think about. Oh, no. I wouldn't say it's second nature. It's like first nature. It's like breathing. Denise is my second mom. I mean, she's... she's there when you need her. And even when you don't need her, she's there. If something's not working, she'll make it happen. God-like, I would say. We're gonna call it a dream, but this is a job. This is what she, you know, does. Really, I don't see her. She's home for an hour each day. I mean, sometimes I have to remind her that she is 15. Hey, do some kid's stuff, like, go to the movies, maybe your homecoming. Um, normal children do this. Mom, don't you remember when I went to prom? Barely. That's been years ago. -Really? -Yes. I'm done, on that note. - Gotta go. - So mean. The worst part about doing a great number for your mom is... "Okay. Well, then, what are you doing this year?" It's been like that since I was 16. And, you know, now that we have a good group again, like, there were times when I was like, "Good. We'd win Nationals, we'd win Nationals." And she's like, "All right, what you're doing?" I'm like, "Well, your group isn't as good as it was two years ago. It's not on my shoulders to hit Nationals." But she always just wants that piece. All right. We're gonna try to run this all the way through once. I'll sit on my hands and not cut the music off. But I wanna see where we're at, and then I'll know which section to go to. - Yes? - Yes. All right, let's go. Full out. All right, let's go. I kinda wanted to move into a little bit more of like a twisted musical theater. I just wanted it to be so different than, like, the beautiful contemporary and then really artistic thought out, um... typography that was in the last piece. The piece is called... It's a version of Bob Fosse's "Bye Bye Life," and again taking a different perspective of "Bye Bye Life," saying, "Hello Loneliness." It's saying that, she's saying, "Bye bye life," but he's saying, "Hello to the rest of my life alone," and wherever this space is that we go to afterwards, so... - Give it to me! - Oh. All right. All right. Stop, stop, stop. You know, it's a lot of emotion. It's like, "Oh, you're sad, he dies. The angels come, you can tell they come." And then... Who is he? Who are you? He's the gatekeeper. - You are the gatekeeper. - Yeah, that's me. Anthony, the gatekeeper. No, I mean, you're funny. Yeah. My family is really involved in dance. My aunt was actually a professional ballet dancer for Atlanta Ballet. When I was about six, my grandmother, after school one day was like, "We're going on a trip." And we ended up here. I wasn't too happy about it on the way, because sports is what I wanted to do. And I came in, and I had a little interview class. I was six. And it went pretty well. I was really excited. I saw a bunch of pretty little girls. And I immediately fell in love with it. Yeah, that's... I want you to really work... When you work on that... When you work on that... Yeah, make sure that resistance in the back stays engaged. Anthony's been in Montessori since he was born because we kept him in the office when he was an infant. Montessori has, what I said before that I think Denise and the studio have, the ability to inspire, and the children there. As long as you inspire them to do something they love, they're going to be successful, and that's been his experience. My favorite thing about Miss Denise is how personable she is. Because a lot of other studios that I talk to, people that I meet, they aren't personable with their teachers at all. Their relationships are so distant from each other, and I find that so weird, because at our studio, we're so, like, connected in a way that we're not aware that we're so connected, to the point that we're all family. She has the ability to see every kid and believe in each child for what they have and what's inside them. And especially this group right now, because they've been dancing together so long, there's this interconnectedness that's really powerful. NUVO is usually nerve-racking. Like, she said, they're... It's their first time putting on pretty much the majority of their pieces that they're gonna do for the remaining part of the year. And so parents get stressed because there's costumes, and we're gonna make sure, you know, make sure they're right. It's two. -That we could cut. -That we could cut up, yeah. He can't eat. Yeah. But they think there's something else too. So they haven't pinned that... Point that down yet. Or maybe not. But, um... But I think it's because he's lost so much weight. I bought him, oh, my God, at Doumar's Barbecue, and he ate almost all of that. But he didn't eat any of his breakfast, he didn't eat any of his lunch. But that's why I bought him the Doumar. So I'm hoping he ate a little bit at dinner. Anyway, but I'm struggling with this because... -Oh. -You know, it's like I'm a bad mom. No, you're not. No, you're not. I've done this before. It's like, it's a no-brainer. Like, I'm trying to do both. I know, you're trying to be a mommy to both. Cami and Aimee are leaving tonight. I will not be in their van. Um... So I bought a flight to leave tomorrow. I have to meet, uh, with Shannon's doctors in the morning, okay? So, um... Hopefully I'm gonna make it there by Teen Solos. Um, I got permission that if I do get on that flight, that I can move them back just so you know this, okay? If not, then I'm not gonna make it for solos. And I'm sorry to disappoint you, and I've been toying with this all day, and I cried a bunch of times, but I gotta be a mom. I'm always your mom, but I gotta be a mom to Shannon first, okay? So hopefully, though, I'll arrive tomorrow night, okay? - Yes? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes! All right. We got this! We didn't want Denise to know that we're really scared for her not coming, and scared for Shannon being sick. So we kinda like kept it to ourselves, but we prayed a lot. Just for Shannon to get better and for her to be able to make it. Oh, we're going! What time is it now? It's 11:30 at night. So they have to leave. Some of them are leaving, I guess at 4:00 in the morning, 5:00 in the morning, 6:00 in the morning, to get up to DC area. So the dancers arrive. Um, the very first thing they do is have an audition. This is gonna be count two. He'll be in demi to ronde de jambe, dégagé, taking the leg around. Good. The very first thing within that audition is the ballet. So they are scored on ballet technique. They're taught a very short ballet combination by one of our instructors. They're adjudicated and scored. And then after the ballet is finished, we go into jazz. One, two, three, and four, plus five, plus six, and a seven. Release. Good. And we do a very, very classic jazz style to be able to see the dancer's techniques. The more you get noticed in Regionals, I feel like the more they'll remember you at Nationals. To qualify for Nationals, I have to get a Runner-up or a Winner scholarship to compete at Nationals. Of course, I push myself for, like, personal goals and reasons, but also my parents, they sacrificed a lot for me. And since my brother lives in Florida, too, um, just money... We don't go on family vacations. We... Our vacations are the dance... the company conventions. Weekends? There's no weekends. It's all dance. Dance means so much to me. I've loved it since I was a little girl. I've always loved performing. I have a hard time putting into words what I feel or what I have to say. So dance is just a great way to express how I feel through movement. It's just something I need in my life, and if I didn't have it, I don't know what I would do, because it's what I'm best at. The all-age divisions do their auditions. They're adjudicated by a panel. And then there's a percentage that's added to the next thing they do, which is their solo performance. I always get nervous before I go on stage, I don't know why. Up next is number 166, with the Teen Contemporary Solo, this is Anessa with "Infiltrate." I gotta go. I gotta go. On stage, when I start my beginning pose, I'm like, "Oh, gosh, here we go." And then during, it kinda just, like, fades away, and I try not to think about anything. I just try to live my moment on stage. So I've always been competitive, since I did cheer and gymnastics, and dance my whole life, just... And my parents are competitive too. It's just something that's always in me. And that was number 166, "Infiltrate." Thank you. I thought you looked more mature. -You felt good? -Yeah. How do you feel? Um, Shannon is... They let him out of the hospital. -Amazing. -Like a miracle happened. I told you. Because I wasn't coming. And when I walked in on Friday morning, -from Thursday night to Friday morning... -Yeah. It's like, "Wait a minute, you have come?" Your face was, like, "What's going on?" Amazing. Phew. Better. And also, what are you looking? You're looking at your hand? My name is Jordan, and I'm a senior at Woodside High School. Dance for me is like a freedom of expression and just an escape into, like, an alternate world. And I just... every time I go to that place, it's just really calm and serene, and that's where I love to be. Our next contestant, 256, with a Senior Contemporary Solo, this is Jordan with "Escape." Miss Cami choreographed my solo which is called "Escape," and it was originally for college. At that time, I was really overwhelmed by college stuff, auditions, getting my resumes, and I told her I don't know what to do with myself. So she told me we're just gonna create movement off of two sentences. The first sentence is, "I feel overwhelmed." And the second sentence is, "I create stillness." There's no outside stress, there's no dance stress. There's just calm. At the end of the solo, when I throw my hand out, the stress around me, I put it down and finally just walk away from it, and it's just me and the stillness. That was number 256, "Escape." Your leg got up so high. Improv. Improv. Loved it. It's okay. Hey. Where did you improv? See, you didn't know it. Ah! Hey. No. That's when you're an artist. Yeah. I'm like, "Wait a minute. What is she doing? What?" -The stage was so slippery. -No. But that's what you do. You don't let it affect you. I know. I'll do two turns and suspended, and I was like... -She felt slippery, and so she just... -Never, never knew. No, she just went in, and that's what you do, though. -You let it go, and you let it go. -Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah, that was so good. Oh! - What's wrong? - The lights aren't working. -Which one is it? -I don't know. -Are they-- -All of these are working. What about... What's happening up here? Huh? I don't know which set it is. Unplug real quick. Because... What am I gonna do? Like, take two minutes and try to figure it out. That's what I've been doing, Denise. Did he check this one too? All right, so we just gotta do them without. All right. God, come on, man. Come on, God. Nothing's working. They're not responding at all. Try it one more time, and then I'll just tell them to gather. Is it... All of them are off? Are they all off? All off. They came on.

Unplug..." I start that computer, and I'm saying a prayer, and then take it, and it started again. -God did it. God did it. -By the grace of God. No. I did know. Because I said I'm saying a prayer. I said, "Unplug and start it. I'm saying a prayer right now." And it started again, and it came on.

Doing beautiful work this afternoon. In sixth place high point is Hallie dancing to "I Tried" from Denise Wall Dance Energy. We have two dancers in third place high point, and the award for third, first goes to Trinity dancing to "Mon Dieu," from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Second place high point, we also have two dancers. And our first dancer in second... So going to Anthony, dancing to "At The Seas," from Denise Wall Dance Energy. And we have one dancer standing alone in first place, put your hands together, everybody. First place overall Teen Solo is... is Anessa dancing to "Infiltrate" from Denise Wall Dance Energy. We'll wait for Anessa to come over here, so we can see her. Ladies and gentlemen, those are your top 10 Teen Soloists. So starting with our Senior Female Division. The audition this morning was really, really tough. Our second winner represents Denise Wall Dance Energy, it's Jordan Gaskin number 885. We have two winners for Senior Male. And finally, there's Wyeth Walker, number 865. Take a bow, guys. Wonderful work. And the highest scoring Teen Extended Line in first place goes to "Hello Loneliness" from Denise Wall Dance Energy. I didn't think I was gonna win at all, or do as good as I did, but it paid off. Yeah. Three spots. Oh, wait a minute, I did take the top three spots. Oops! I know. Cameras! Thank you for all your grace and mercy and bestowing her talents... I applied for Pace University almost in the summer. I was really into it. Denise told me about it Yay! Yay! Oh, my gosh. Hello. This is Jordan. Jordan, hi. This is Rhonda Miller calling from Pace University, New York City. I'm calling you on my cell phone. Hi. And I'm calling to congratulate you on being accepted into my program at Pace University. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. -Wow. -Oh, my gosh. The director of the program is calling to congratulate you. That's crazy. To tell you how much she wants you there. -Oh, man. -That's crazy. You feel special, right? -I really do. -I know. Again, with this scholarship, I'm, like, halfway there. But if, um, I'm not able to pay just a little bit more, then I might not be able to go and I will really be heartbroken. Financially, it's... it's a burden. It's a lot. We try to manage... Well, I try to manage. I'm a single parent. So it's one income to try to handle the tuition, and also the company fees. And, of course, I work here at Old Dominion University. But I've had to pick up a second job on the weekends. I clean houses. May, all the way through... really October, I will work seven days a week, if, you know, if we're not traveling for a competition or so. NYCDA has college audition scholarships, and if I go to NYCDA, then that means I'm able to go for a $10,000 scholarship that would really, really help right now. Because I'm almost out of money. But, um, that would really help. That means I have to go to NYCDA, like, the first week of July, and then come back here, back to the studio, and then go to Dance Awards, which is a lot. But if I have to do it for money reasons, then I would, I would do it in a heart beat. Up here, like, 'cause you're looking up here. -Just open your chest a little bit more. -Okay. There's not enough words to really tell you what Denise has meant to us. Um, she took Morgan to where she is right now as a dancer. But she's also taken Morgan where she is as a person. I have a small stutter. For me, dance has, like, helped me through that, and it's like my way of speaking, because it's my way of expressing and showing who I am without, like, uh... physically saying it. Most kids don't get that experience of having a team, and they're all, like, your age. So it's like having a bunch of sisters who are, like, twins. Um, last summer, I competed for Teen Best Dancer, and I won. I'm still so surprised by it, but I somehow did it. Um, so this year, I haven't been competing my solo at Regionals. I've been performing it on Sunday, during the closing show. Denise, to me, is definitely like my second mother. She's helped me through so much. In June of 2014, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, right before the first year that she was going to Nationals. Um, so as you can imagine, with that kind of diagnosis, our whole world just sort of came apart and just really shattered. I... I remember I was in a solo private with Denise in, like, June, before my first Nationals. Um, and then... I had, like, not talked about it much, and then I did one step and I broke down. And her and Cami were there to, like, comfort me, and really, like, help me through that. I'm a breast cancer survivor, and I would say probably one of the greatest gifts that Travis ever gave me, 'cause I, um... I've... Just since then, I've had, you know, ten surgeries to do with that. I went through chemo, I went through radiation. But in the middle of all of my surgeries, Travis was doing So You Think. I expressed... I choreographed from, um, personal issues. It's a way for me to get through things in my life. Um, I don't... not the best with words, and not the best with confrontations sometimes, but what I do is, if something's pent-up, or if there's a way for me to release something, um, I will create a piece for it. And, this is what I was choreographing for the show every week, and it was... it was crazy to think that, um... uh, I got to that place, 'cause it's all I ever wanted. So I have my career over here that's quite amazing, but my mom is like... It's just very hard. Um, and so I... Jeff called me, and he says, "I have something for you." I said, "What is it?" "I have Allison and Robert for you this week." And I just like... I just fell on my knees. I remember I was outside of my friend's house, and I fell on my knees. And I just go, "This is the perfect couple." And I get to do this piece for her. I get to give her something that's gonna be worth seeing, it's gonna be worth watching. Allison, she's known Allison since she was ten years old. She's known Robert since he was ten years old. She knows both of these people. They're not random people dancing on a television show with me putting out my piece of art and work, and heart for her. And so I walked up onto that stage nervous... Here with All-Star Allison, ladies and gentlemen, it's Robert. ...but also excited and so honored. ♪ When you try your best But you don't succeed ♪ ♪ Stuck in reverse... ♪ Dancing for someone that I love and cherish so much. I was being her, I was channeling her. I was being who she is to me on that dance floor. So I had to be bigger, and I had to be better than I've ever been in my entire life for myself, for her. It was about, um, Travis wanting to help me and fix me, you know, during my trying to survive. You know, because I did become, um, septic at one point, and almost bit the dust. So this is how it started. I saw her walking really slowly. I came in right before she fell. And then, uh, the whole point of the piece was to, uh, have this path that we're going down and saying that we're gonna get from here, and there's a light at the end of the tunnel, we're gonna get there together. And we started at the corner, we ended over there. And at that point, I was, "I'll do anything for me to get you there. I'll do anything for me to get you on your feet. I'll do anything for this cancer to go away. Please just let me help you take it away." I just remember telling her I was doing it for her, and said, "Just watch it. Just have a lot of tissues." And, Travis, much love and luck with your crisis at the moment. And much love and support for Denise, in everything she's attempting to do. I guess this is, to me, a cry of the season. Um, yeah, it brings me back to the last week before my mom passed, and, um, and how much I wanted to fix her. It was just awesome, and, Denise Wall, I'm praying for you. The feeling I have on the stage, it's seriously, to this day, one of the strongest and best ones I've ever had. That piece earned me my first Emmy nomination. And my mom was almost slightly better, and I was like, "I don't care if you're not good enough. You're walking on the red carpet with me." When I first went in the hospital, the doctor told me, he said, you know, "You're gonna be in here for, like, ten days. At least ten days." And I said, "Okay." I said, "Well, I have to go teach at the Dance Teacher Summit in New York City." I said, "So I can only stay in here for maybe one to two days." And he said, um, "No, you're not getting out of the hospital," you know. "You're in intensive care." And he said, "You're very sick." And I said, "Okay, all right. Well, maybe I'll stay for two days, maybe three days. And then I'll miss the first day of teaching. But I've gotta go to New York. I've gotta teach." He looks at my mother, he goes, "What is wrong with her?" My mom goes, "It's called dance." I love giving somebody a chance that actually has the passion. And if they've got that gut and they wanna do it, and I want for them to say that they want it. It's not that they wanna do it, it's that they have to do it. I told my parents when I was like five or six, "I wanna dance." And my dad said, "No, put him in gymnastics." So we did gymnastics for a couple of years, and then that didn't work out so well. This is what I have to do. I love... Like, dance is in my brain all the time, like music. I can't... I can't just sit there and listen to music. There has to be... There's always something that gets in my head, and it's just... Dance is a way to expand physically and mentally, like, it's great. It's a personal research and personal, like, exploring. "We drive, we pay, we clap" is our joke. Wyeth is so happy dancing, and it just... He doesn't walk, he dances everywhere. And his mind is always singing and rhythmic, and he's always moving. And so that's his soul. Today, my son, Travis Wall, flew in. Um, he flew here for two days before he goes to LA. He's going to try to cram in as many solos as he can, for the Dance Awards. He's stressed out, I'm stressed out. It's a crazy situation 'cause he's... It's a lot of pressure for him because he's got to pick... He's got to come up with new music. Something that's going to fit them, make them look really good, but also something that's gonna make them grow, you know, for the next year, because they'll present those and then they keep those for the year. -Hey. -This is literally my life. Did you see the song list she has up here? I looked at it briefly. Ah. Like it? Whoo! Last night, we found, um... we picked out a song. It's like 10:45. We were all, like, really tired, but, um, we kinda just like... He played this song, and Miss Denise and I and him, we all just like... like our eyes lit up, and it was really awesome. You were a lot easier than Wyeth. I still don't have a song for him. And can you lower your body further? Uh-huh. So it's like you almost like fold in half. Go, go. Shoot. Like that, and then... Yes, just like... Yeah. I just finished my solo with Travis, and it's really hard. But once I get it and, like, rehearse it a lot, it's gonna... I think it's gonna be really good. Working on the outside. I can't walk, but it's all good, 'cause this is what I do. And let's say you're walking in a circle at the section. This is definitely my most challenging solo I've had so far. The process was kind of long because trying to figure out moves that match perfectly to the intricate music was hard, but we did it somehow. I don't know how he did it, but he did. She was all over the floor, um, just trying to remember it quick, and understand, uh, it's very mature for her to add all this cha-cha, which is exactly... like, he's so smart. He's so smart. It's exactly what she needs to really take her as a dancer to the next level. I'm very sore. I don't think I've ever been this sore. I made a chiropractor appointment for tomorrow. Well, he's trying to get eight of them done. Eight solos done in two days. And that's a lot of pressure. You know, it took him, you know, a while to fill it up. It was almost how much time he was taking to create what the music was doing. He probably could have done maybe two solos. Maybe three. So I just learned my solo for Dance Awards. It was different. It was like a good different, like, I feel like it's gonna challenge me more, it's gonna, like, push me a lot. Like, I love his choreography, I love how he teaches. He can be intimidating at times, but, like, he's also family. It's actually an honor. He's amazing. To me, it was stressful, but I'm excited. I don't wanna give you, like, a character-driven thing. I kinda want you to... I don't know, manipulate your body. My body is shutting down, like... I haven't learned my solo yet, and there are six weeks left till Nationals. I'm learning it this weekend, Sunday, Monday. Jason Parsons is coming back to do it. I'm really excited, but I'm really nervous, 'cause not that much time, but... Jason's movement is very different from other people's, but because now, I've worked with him last year by myself, and with the group this year, I'm more comfortable with it. But, like any solo, it just takes repetition. Privates with Denise are really hard to do. There's a lot of this, a lot of solos. And everybody kinda gets them, not last minute, but really close to Nationals, so... A lot of it has to do with just how I manage my time. He wants you to do it from there. Oh, that boy's crazy. All right. Well, that's something... Well, let's fix everything else and we'll go back to that. Well, I'm a little bit sad that this year is coming to an end, but I'm excited to dance one last time as the Teen Best Dancer. I shouldn't have to say things 20 times, okay? You, you're not like normal kids, okay? And if you're gonna act like normal kids, Nationals is gonna go down the drain. - Everybody understand that? - Yes. Okay, I told you this the other day. When it comes to Nationals, I don't play. How many of you wanna do, uh, good at Nationals? All right, put your hands down. I was hoping that you wouldn't raise your hand, 'cause being good is not good enough. 'Cause you're not just good. And it's not that I'm all about winning, it's not that. It's you want to... You wanna be exceptional. And that's not just with dance, that's just in life. You wanna be exceptional at anything that you do. That's some nice splits there. All right. Get back up, do it again. Do it again. Quick, quick, quick! Let's see. Well, at least we have ballet first. I can get that out of the way. And then you have a little more of a break. Right. And then contemporary with everybody. - Yeah. - And then, um... I get to ask around some more questions. Tomorrow, I really hope I can get a scholarship that will help me to go here, and it'll be better for my mom. I'm super nervous, but I'm ready for it. And I'm doing ballet, and then I have a break, and then I do contemporary with the juniors and the seniors who've committed. And then we get to do a Q&amp;A with all the faculty, and college people that will be there. The class that we just observed, those dancers have all found a college. They all know where they're going to college, and they're hoping for, and they've already received the financial aid package from the college of their choice. They're hoping for extra money from the foundation, which they can take to the college of their choice to help offset some of their tuition. Enjoy it and have fun, and I hope you learned a lot. And I hope to see you again soon, and see you on the stage soon. This is my second... Actually, this is actually my third night of doing my Midnight Madness, where I stay up all night and I do solos for my best dancers. So we do privates on their solos. So it's what, 12:38 at night. I have so many kids that want scholarships to go for Best Dancer. So we have all these solos, and so instead of saying, "Oh, only four people can have it." I did this a couple of years ago. I said, "Look, if I offered for everybody, then they can't get mad at me, 'cause it's probably the middle of the night. No one's gonna wanna come in the middle of the night." And I put up sign-up sheets. And what happened? 'Cause I went 11:30, 12:30. I mean, I've got 4:30. Come in at 4:30. They filled up every space. So now, this has been the thing happening for the last three years. I hope to make top three in the Best Dance competition. If not that, top 10, but my goal is top three. So take them on that roller coaster ride, because that... that just makes it like, you know... Yeah, yeah. Take out those hands more. Do it again. I feel like you need... You're... This supporting leg's too rigid. I don't even know if I can get it... I don't even know if I can go to sleep tonight. I may not be able to go to sleep. Well, obviously, my dream would be to win Best Dancer. Oh, that's even better. Or get in the top three. Those are like... That's, like, my main goal in life right now. But I'm happy with just getting top 20 as a first-year Teen, 'cause I'm at the lowest of the age categories. So good, so good. Don't freak yourself out. This year is... I really wanna at least make top 20. I know it's a new thing, like, Senior Division, but I've done pretty well this year, at the competitions we've gone to in my division against the other guys that we've seen. So I hope to make top 20. I don't know about top 10, it's just what happens, 'cause you can't predict how your solo will go on stage, who's judging, what response you'll get. Like, it's hard to predict those things. You can just work your best and hope. Try as soon as we leave to sleep until we need to stop for breakfast, and then fall back to sleep after that when I can. Try and store up enough energy as we stay up with Denise the next week. Right now, we're in the RV and we're gonna drive down to Florida today, and we're gonna, like, stop somewhere, but it's gonna be really fun. I'm excited and nervous because it's such like, a big, like, competition, and it's, obviously, it's Nationals, so, like, this is what I've been waiting for all year, you know. But I'm, like, really excited. I just wanna go out there and just kill it. I got back from New York, at one o'clock. We were supposed to get into Virginia at 9:00, but we got delayed at LaGuardia Airport. Um, I went to rehearsal, did a whole bunch of run-throughs, and then now I'm here. So it's probably less than 24 hours. Denise is here. Yeah. I was really disappointed not to get a scholarship for NYCDA. I really just wanted to help my mom out. I did get some out of it. I got a regional scholarship to NYCDA. So next time, if I wanna go, I don't have to pay anything. I'm very tired, but it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna push through this week, and I think it's gonna be a really good Nationals. I got here around, like twelve o'clock, and we're about to have a rehearsal. We're not here as individuals. Even the best dancers, you're not here as individuals. You're here as DWDE. That's what we're here for. -We're here as a team, yes? -Yes. Okay, why are you here? That's what I want all of you to think about tonight. Why are you here? Okay? Is someone making you be here? Hopefully not. I'm hoping that you are the one that wants to be here. - Does that make sense? - Yes. And I'm gonna say this. If we come and we don't win the thing, as long as our journey was good... No. I'm being honest. This is gonna be your hardest National ever. Coming into Nationals, just from, like, auditions so far, there's so many good teams. Like, so many good dancers. It's like... It's crazy. This morning, we had 8:00 a.m. auditions for Best Dancer. Um, we had ballet first, and then jazz. And, um, my last name starts with a Z, so I went first for ballet. And that went pretty good. I felt a little shaky since it was in the morning. So far, it seems kinda like an equal playing field for me, 'cause the audition was, like, kinda shaky for everybody. All right. Thank you guys so much. Exit to the right. You have to find a way to stand out in the room. They're all internalizing, "How do I become an individual?" "How do I take all the things Denise has taught me and actually incorporate them into these seven days?" you know. "Put my best foot forward in such a small amount of time." 'Cause it could really make or break the opportunities that they get in the future. I think that these kids, especially, I think they downplay it. I'm pretty sure they're freaking out inside, but I think they wait for this moment all year and they're so excited. How's it going, buddy? Good to see you. I didn't make top 20 last year, so I place, like, behind everyone else... which was, uh, a little bit of a confidence blow, but it, uh, it was something that... It caused a lot of thought and personal change throughout this whole year, like, work ethic-wise, and just like trying to keep myself focused on why I really am doing this, and what the results could actually be, 'cause I'm just gonna put my all into this and work because this is what the entire year's been about. I really just wanna develop a better me throughout this process because last year was a little rough, and I'm better than that. Moving from the auditions, which seem to be a very nerve-wrecking experience for the dancers in the first place, now, they have to go on stage by themselves and do their solos, and they only get one shot to do the solo. And most of the time, the solo is only two and a half minutes, three minutes at most. And it weighs the most heavily with their scoring. It's 50% of their score. It was like five hours before I went on stage, we had to change my costume. I hated her costume. It wasn't the costume I wanted. I said I wanted a big skirt. I wanted a lot of movement. And they found the right color, but the skirt, like, they cut it up, and it had slits, and there was no fullness to the skirt, so I took my two-hour break that I had today, and I went to the outlet mall, and I found a skirt. Okay, don't throw it away. But, honey, you better let them have it. -It's gonna be so good. -Go to church, girl. Go to church. We're going to church. Ready. We get in our head a lot, like... I feel like we all, being Denise's students, have something to show, since she does teach us every single day. Up next, we have number 46. It's Trinity Bonilla in "Summertime." When she started out, I was, like, "Okay. She's hesitating a bit." I was like, "What is she doing?" And I was so glad she did, because she started here, then she took it to a whole another place. My head was spinning on stage. But I was mostly thinking about the corrections that would help me, like, stick around it, and just having fun, like, not holding back. ♪ Try to take ♪ ♪ Take to the sky ♪ ♪ Lord, the sky ♪ ♪ Until that morning ♪ ♪ Honey, nothing's going to harm you now ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no, no ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no, no ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no, no No, no, don't you cry ♪ ♪ Cry... ♪ Trinity was gorgeous. Trinity was so full, and she became the music. -I'm so proud of you. -It was so good. Thank you. Last week, I hurt my hip, and I have bursitis. Anessa, for her, I was scared 'cause I didn't even know if she would be dancing. She, um, strained her hip, and then she ended up with bursitis. When you're doing the transition, you gotta keep that face. Before she went on, I just said, you know, "Take the nerves out of this." I said, "You need to make sure that you exude confidence." I said, "Just trust yourself that you're gonna be there." Technically, I think she starts to, sometimes, gets a little nervous on, "Oh, God, this part's coming up, this part's coming up." And she's never really present in the moment. Okay, let's just... Okay. See, you can do the eyebrows. You gotta do that. You need to look... get in their eyes. Fashionista! ♪ Beautiful ♪ That was my first time doing it. I've never felt it on the stage before. And it felt really good, like, surprisingly. I thought I would feel more, like, really nervous on stage, and, like, shaky, but I felt really grounded and confident. I was kinda nervous about, like, my hair getting in my face, but it worked out. And just trying to keep my balance and control, so I wouldn't fall over. I was a little worried about that. She was on her leg. And the style, just the look of it, it was just so different than everything else that they were seeing tonight, so I think she definitely loosened up. ♪ You are ♪ ♪ My amazing new patch ♪ -It's... You're amazing. -Thank you. -Do you feel amazing? -Yeah, I feel really good. Oh, my God. You looked like you were, like, a 20-year-old supermodel up there. It's like, you know... You were so controlled and the physicality and the texture, the eyes. Oh, my God. Amazing. I think you killed it with the model, yeah. So during the jazz audition, we had a double turn on the left, and my pinky toe, like, fell behind, and now it's broken. When I got backstage, I was like... I was like, "Oh, my God, this is really happening." Yeah, I danced with a broken toe. I was a little, at the beginning of the dance, I, like, slipped a little bit. But the judges, they couldn't see it. But I was like, "Oh, thank God. Dang." I felt free, like, the song says, like, you know, "I might be small, but, like, I can dance really big, and, you know, be this powerful little girl on stage." That was so great. Huh? I know, 'cause you were slipping with your socks. Yeah, it's okay. It was good. Hallie's routine has very sharp, aggressive dancers. And for me, she was fluid when she needed to be fluid, and she was hard-hitting when she needed to do so. I felt like her dynamics finally spoke through it. And I felt like she had a lot of shades today. So super proud of her. Felt like she came offstage. She's like, "I could've done better," you know. And this is the first time in the Teen category. She placed really well in the Junior category last year. But when you step into that Teen category, it's a whole nother ball game. For me, the Teen category is the hardest category in all of the competition. And just the way it works out with, like, the best of the juniors coming up from 13, and then these people are just about to peak and go into the 16-year-old category. It's incredible what... what talent brings into this age group. Oh, he's getting into it now. He likes reaction from the crowd. The most challenging thing, obviously, was the shoes...not falling. So I didn't really have that much time to work on it in between. It kinda has a clubby feel to it. When I first started, it wasn't upbeat, but the more I worked on it, the more it became upbeat. He is a damn performer now. I thought it was part of your solo, man. I watched, no choice. I didn't-- I thought it was... No. I was gonna fall. That was... that was... It was right on the beat, too. -Yeah. -That was awesome. That was amazing. Fold again. More. I just... I just love that. I don't know why. Be yourself, be unique. But I need the ramp, I need the shift. I need you stepping out of it, and just... I know you'll make great choices. Okay? Don't throw anything. I want you to look like you're also on your leg. Yes? All right, let's go. Uh, this piece... the piece is called "Save Me From Myself." Um, so it's about, um... having personal demons or, like, personal memories that haunt you and, like, alter you in, like, your decisions, so, in actions. So I really tried to, like, literally show those demons inside me, but at the same time, like, reveal to the audience what I've been going through, and how, like, this has affected me, so... I always, like, way in the back of my mind, I was thinking about, like, technique and moves and stuff, but I was really trying to process, like, being a character and being a creature. Oh. I learned it in a convention room with Travis. So it was... it was... like, from there, it's the constantly shifting and evolving in different places. Once I finally got to the studio, it was great to have Denise to help me. Oh. Alien. Alien. So amazing. Just an alien. Just an alien. That, that last part... A whole nother... Thank you so much. I haven't felt that good about, uh, completing something like that in a while, so it's a big confidence boost, and, yeah. And especially with Denise, and having even Travis' approval, that means a lot. It is gonna be tough, okay? 'Cause I can already tell you... Elite, teen number from Sonya... I'm gonna tell you something. Every number affects the next piece. Okay? I'm gonna say it again. Every number affects the next piece. The way psychology goes. So I need everybody to be very focused all day, 'cause we got our work cut out for us. If you wanna try to be in the finale, then we got our work cut out for us. We have to show the training. That's gonna be a big difference. Because there's a lot of tap schools that are... the ones that are here. I love you, guys. -Thank you for... -You too. Everything that we've been working on since last Nationals, every class these kids have taken, every rehearsal these kids have done, every convention that these kids had, every master teacher I brought in, it all boiled down to today. ♪ A billion people died On the news tonight ♪ ♪ But not so many cried At the terrible sight ♪ ♪ Well, mama said it's just make-believe ♪ ♪ You can't believe everything you see ♪ ♪ So, baby, close your eyes To the lullabies ♪ ♪ On the news tonight ♪ ♪ Who's the one to decide That it would be all right? ♪ ♪ To put the music Behind the news tonight ♪ ♪ Well, mama said ♪ ♪ Mmm, mmm ♪ ♪ Why don't the newscasters cry ♪ ♪ When they read about people who die? ♪ ♪ At least they could be decent enough ♪ ♪ To put just a tear in their eyes ♪ ♪ Mama said it's just make-believe ♪ ♪ You can't believe everything you see ♪ ♪ So, baby, close your eyes To the lullabies ♪ ♪ On the news tonight ♪ That was number 46, "On The News."

The audience was, like, laughing and crying. He's pretty happy with it, so... score. 'Cause it was more than incredible for me. It was... Sorry. All the hard work, those kids just threw their hearts out on the floor. One thing I say all the time, "Why are you afraid to be good?" Well, they weren't afraid to be good at all today. That was number 98, "Sing, Sing, Sing." - Yay! - Oh, my God. It was so good. What's wrong? What do you need? What do you need? You need water? What do you need? What's wrong? -It hurts a lot. -Your Achilles? All right. You need to ice it. Get in a bucket of ice water. Let's go. Trinity came off crying from "Sing, Sing, Sing." Her Achilles was bothering her earlier, but her calf cramped up. They have to be in amazing shape. They have to not just be ready for their own solo performance, but they have to pull up, literally pull up the rest of the week for their fellow teammates, for their fellow dancers, for their... for their studios. Guess they're all just beat up from... We've gone from show mode, to doing the show, to doing National rehearsal, you know, to come in here, and they're getting up-- They're staying late up night. They have to get up early in the morning. You'll see a studio rehearsing in the corner, and they have to rework their routine because, you know, one of the dancers have gone down, or they've gotten hurt, or they've gotten sick. Yeah. So it's really, really quite intense. I have 17 routines re-competing in our closing show. In a couple of days, seven will rise. First off is "At A Loss" from Columbia City Jazz. Joining that, "24," from Canadian Dance Unit. "Hello Loneliness" from Denise Wall Dance Energy. She's never done this before. -It's fun, isn't it? -Yeah. We are about to see some of the most talented dancers from around the world, as they compete here tonight for the title of Best Dancer 2017. Tonight, we find out who the top 20 is. We announce the top 20 as a recognition, because there are so many kids that are participating. Top 20, here we go. Joziah German from Prodigy Dance and Performing Arts Centre. Anthony Kelly from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Oh, my God! Anessa Zivic from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Trinity Bonilla from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Megan Caines from Vlad's Dance Company. Jordan Gaskin from Denise Wall Dance Energy. And from there, we announce the top 10. Murphy Lee from Performing Dance Arts. Anthony Kelly from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Go! Whoa! That says a lot. That says a lot. Quinn Starner from Stars Dance Studio. Anessa Zivic from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Yay! Louise from Stars Dance Studio. Trinity Bonilla from Denise Wall Dance Energy. I was terrified seeing the audience watching them go through the seniors. Like, okay, the top 20 is here, now the top 10. Wyeth Walker from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Yay! If we make it in the top 10, it's the improv. And I've seen people choke. And someone I think who has struggled with that is Anessa. You just have to... just do it. So you don't even know what part of the music you're really gonna hit on either. They pick somebody random, or whoever they pick, and they go down that order and come back. I just had this feeling that she would be nervous 'cause it was her first time, um... But the adrenaline came out and she killed it. Improv is really stressful, like, on that big stage, and everyone judging you. Judges, please rank these ladies 1 through 10 and pass your sheets out. The competition is so good. They're all, like, really flexible. I'm nervous. All right. Thank you so much to our ten ladies. They get to the top 10. You know, they know they're getting really, really close. And now they have to do the improv, it becomes more and more intense throughout the week, so we'll see what they're made of. Senior guys are last, so we waited through the whole thing backstage with ants in our pants, waiting to go on stage and... I think there were 10 or 11 of us up on stage, improving. So that round was really fun. That's a wrap. Thank you, seniors. You guys can exit to the right. We'll have some results shortly. And 2016 Teen Female Best Dancer winner, from Denise Wall Dance Energy, this is Morgan Higgins. I will be performing my solo, "Ave Maria," during the Best Dancer dance-off. And I'm excited about it. I'm a little bit nervous just 'cause, like... I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me, and it's more of me putting the pressure on myself, 'cause I want it to be, like, flawless and just, like, look so good, and be like the perfect way to hand down my title. This solo means so much to me. It's a tribute in a prayer to my granddad who was probably one of the most influential people in my life. We were so close. I miss him so much. And it's a tribute to all loved ones we've lost. Yes! Performing this on stage, it was pretty surreal for me. Kind of a dream almost. I was like in, like, this alternate world, just, like, dancing, and it was just incredible. I really felt that he was there, and that he was with me. Ladies and gentlemen, that was our 2016 Teen Female Best Dancer winner, Miss Morgan Higgins. I handed down my title as Teen Best Dancer. It's really bittersweet, though, because this year has been incredible, and I'm really sad that it's over, but I'm ready to work hard for next year. Once they finish the improvisation, that score is combined with their... Or tallied, I should say, with their solo score and the audition score. Once that's tallied, that will take us to our top three. Once the top three are announced, all the scores previous are completely erased and we start all over. They re-compete in the same evening, and they get a brand-new score based on their solo performance, and they're ranked by the judges one through three, and that's how we come up with our winners. Three of you will be re-competing your solos. First off is Joziah German from Prodigy Dance and Performing Arts Centre. Joining him will be Findlay McConnell from Elite Danceworx. Last but not least, Julian Lombardi from Canadian Dance Unit. All right, ladies. It is time. I'm going to announce four names. I need you to step forward. That means you will be re-competing your solo very shortly. In random order, Quinn Starner from Stars Dance Studio. Kelis Robinson from Elite Danceworx. Vivian Ruiz from Stars Dance Studio. And Anessa Zivic from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Let's give all these ladies on stage a big round of applause. Congratulations, guys. You can all exit to the right. And we'll see you shortly. Nice work. All right, gentlemen. If I call your name, step forward. It means you are re-competing your solo shortly. First up is... Benjamin Peralta from Britney Boyd Dance Company. Michael Novitski from Vlad's Dance Company. Last but not least, Wyeth Walker from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Oh, my God! Gentlemen, congratulations to all of you on stage. Thank you so very much. Nice work. I just peed my pants. - Oh, great. - I'm soaked wet. You didn't pee? I gotta go. I gotta change. I mean, just... It just went, everything. Everything in my bladder. Everything in my bladder just went. I'm sorry. So you already won. I don't care where you place. The accomplishment of you being put there, okay? It was crazy around me. Denise was trying to do my makeup, and my mom and Miss Denise were trying to do my hair. And everyone was like, telling me, "Good job," and coming up to me. So it's a little hectic and chaotic. So it... I'm not kidding, that confidence better be there. Like, make them gag. Okay? Is somebody taking a picture of this? I'm so proud of you. Okay? Glad they're finally seeing what I see, okay? Serve it. Just... It should be fun. That's all... Now it's just fun, okay? Just give them Anessa realness. Yes? Okay? Yup? All right. Let's go, girl. Ready? Definitely, I got super nervous when the number before me, like, the music starts. Like you can tell when it's about to end. Closing on our Teen Female Best Dancer top four, it is Anessa Zivic. ♪ Beautiful ♪ That was Anessa Zivic from Denise Wall Dance Energy. Judges, please rank these ladies one through four. No. It's...

This should be fun for you. That's what I want it to be. I want it just to be fun. Suspend it. Yeah. Not that one, but I like that one too. Watch the other one. Yeah. Yeah. But that was good too. I will take that. It's a show now, okay? 'Cause we've already... Four segments and you're one. You already accomplished way more than I thought you would. - Do you wanna come back? - Yeah, really. Yes? Yeah? Okay. Ready? I've been so nervous about this since, like, this year started. Like, how this year will play out and, like, what's gonna happen. I don't think any of us expected this to happen. Whoo! That was Wyeth Walker from Denise Wall Dance Energy. That solo was an experience. It's an amazing night. - Looking like a pro out there. - I know. Nice work, man. This time I did my solo, I wasn't as on my leg as I was the first time. But I felt like I performed it still... Yeah, my feet were just, like, really sticky. And then they find out, you know, on the gala night. So they have a good two days, to kinda sit and wonder, you know, what their placement's gonna be. So excited to be here at the Dance Awards. I looked so much for you. Just go out there and kill it. That's all I got to say. Just kill it. Do something different. You... You know what you...

All right, guys. Here it is. Your Senior Male Best Dancer first runner-up... is Michael Novitski from Vlad's Dance Company, which means our new Senior Male Best Dancer winner is Mr. Wyeth Walker from Denise Wall Dance Energy. How did that happen? How did that happen? He didn't even make top 20 last year. Whoo! My God! Where is he? Oh, my God. Where is he? Where is he? Oh, my God. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you. I can't... Hey, Denise, congratulations. I'm crying. You know, he didn't make top 20 last year. -Mom? That's his mom? -Yeah, yeah. No. You remember the meaning? Because he didn't make top 20. See, when you work on it every day... Oh, my God. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank him. He's the one that worked. I kept on pushing him every day and he just kept on working. I still don't feel like I just did that. And it's... Yeah. It's really weird. I feel really... yeah. I can't... Yeah. I can't describe it. I'm just... Yeah. I'm really happy, and just... I'm really excited for next year. The adrenaline is falling, so I'm, like, delirious right now. He won Best Senior Dancer. So we're just so excited about that. And he fell to his knees when the guy called, 'cause he didn't expect it either. It was just a rush of emotions once we got off-stage. It was a moment I'll never forget. So I think, it's all like... It's all, like, joy and happiness. It's been great. I'm feeling good. "Hello Loneliness" got first place, um, I got third runner-up for Teen Best Dancer, and Wyeth won Senior Male Dancer. So, yeah! It's a crazy night and I'm so happy with everything. Everyone was so emotional with "Hello Loneliness" because it was, like, our last time dancing together with, like, Jordan and Lexi, and possibly Alena. So we're just so happy and all of our hard work paid off. It was like a really special moment, especially for the seniors. You know, a lot of them are my friends, like, best friends, and, like, one of them is my Moms. My two Moms, Jordan and Alena, you know. And they're gonna be leaving, which is so sad. But I'm so excited for them to see like what's gonna happen in the future. I did a whole bunch of crying today. I'm so proud of us, and I'm really surprised that I got top 20. I was not expecting that at all. Um, I'm so proud of Wyeth and I'm so proud of Anessa, and I'm proud of everybody that... Oh, I'm... I'm gonna miss them so much. When I will feel down at the studio, and, of course, like, dance is my outlet, but they... It's just their energy bringing into me, I just... Oh, I love them so much. She was crying tonight really bad because I told her I'd... They'd never leave my life. I'd stay in touch with them. When they have shows I show up... She'll be in shows in New York, I'll go see her. I'm always gonna be Mama D. Then I'll turn into Grandma D when they have their kids and bring them to me. We won. Got it. And they think I'm professional, but that's okay. We're done! We won. I'm sorry, I'm still, like, still in shock. The whole process starts again. We've got to start getting cracking for Zen and training the kids to another level and get new pieces. It's so funny 'cause I said, after we won, after "Hello Loneliness" won, I sent Travis a text and said, "Thank you so much for the piece." I said, "Now what's next? What are you gonna do next year?" And he sent me... he sent me a face, with the face like this, with a knife coming through his head. So in other words, "Let him be" for tonight. 'Cause I never stop. I'm always going, "Okay, what's next? All right, let's go, let's go." Like, ah, the pressure.
