You won't catch anything that way. Well, I might. Not any fish. I'm not trying to catch any fish. Oh. Just doing this for the exercise, a test for keeping my temper. It's lucky you weren't trying to catch any fish. Oh, yes? Why? Because...I hate to tell you this, but there haven't been fish here for 2o years. Why didn't you tell me in the first place? I didn't want to stop you. I like watching you. There's something about men. I don't know. Have a cigarette? No, thanks. I don't want one, either. How about a sandwich? I have some, thank you. That's what I mean. How about offering me one? All right. Have a sandwich. You've got enough. Expecting company? No. I have a big appetite. Good. I like people with big appetites. Well, I can truthfully say I've eaten well. Four sandwiches to my two, and half my cake, to say nothing of criticizing my fishing. Sorry about lunch, but I'll bring it tomorrow. Tomorrow? Sure. Look, uh... Do you do anything for a living? Commercial artist-- design women's clothes, and draw for a fashion magazine. Good at it? Make a lot of money? Enough to support my daughter. A daughter, huh? How old? Going on 6. What's your husband like? He died four years ago. Sorry. I've got to get back. So do I. Well, good-bye, miss Eden. I enjoyed this. How about you? Mm-hmm. See you tomorrow, huh? I'll be here, Mr...Walker, isn't it? That's it. So long. So long. Want a cigarette? No, thanks. Neither do I. Do you realize we've been here an hour without smoking? I was just thinking that. We haven't said much, either. That's all right, isn't it? It's fine. Conversation's a nervous habit with a lot of people. Know what we should do tomorrow? Tomorrow? I'll show you the Indians. Indians? Branch of the Mohawk. Should we take, uh... By all means. It's time for her bath. Drive us home? That was the intention. Hey, Ellen. Hey! Wake up! Hello. Hello. Guess I had a nap. You sure did. You slept like a log. How does a log sleep? She defeats me again. Mr. Walker will drive us home. You're not supposed to call him Mr. Walker. He prefers "Alec." Right. And mother prefers "Julie." I heard her. What else did you hear? That was all. After that, I went to sleep. You're very nice. I'll let you hold the reins. That was the intention. Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Come on! Come on! Ha ha ha! Uh-uh. Here. This is the way. How did you know that? I used to own this house. I didn't know that. Tell you about it tomorrow. Tomorrow? Bye. Bye. Tell aunt Laura you're back for your bath. Want to come in and watch? Well, no. Not right now. Bye. Bye. Nice kid. Oh, my sketchbook. Oh. I'll give it to you tomorrow. I want to see if you really are any good. Oh. Worried about it? Not a bit. Good-bye, Julie. Good-bye, Alec. Who was that? Just somebody we happened to meet. Name's Walker. What have you been doing? What have you been doing? Lunch and... You know. Yes, I know. All right. I picked him up, or he picked me up. It was all pretty raw. I shouldn't be surprised if he drank. I'm sorry, but you're so suspicious. Whenever you see a man, you think, well... Your husband died while you still trusted him. Maybe if he'd lived longer, you'd have had your eyes opened. Other women have divorced for the same reason. They kept a sense of proportions. You don't know what men are. You're as romantic and full of illusions as any schoolgirl. What's wrong with romance and illusions if you can keep them? You'll find out... Someday. Hi, stranger! Hi, Dave. Oh, mine host! Hi, Archie. Alec, darling. Where have you been? Hello, Suzanne. Your spouse is soused. Stay and talk a minute. I only came to your dull party to see you. Here I am. We're dining out, but I could get away early. Afraid not, Suzanne. I'm all booked up. Hello, dad. Good evening, Alec. How's my very nice mother? Good to see you, Alec. How are you, Ned? Fine, thanks. Well, how are things in town? If you would come into town, you'd know. Didn't you remember Maida was having people in this afternoon? You know how I feel about parties, dad. I don't...Any more than how you feel about your work. They seem to get along at the office without me. Alec... Your mother and I have been very worried about you lately. Isn't there something, well... You used to confide in me, but lately, I feel that-- there's nothing, dad. We don't spend many weekends with you. You might have arranged to be here. Sorry. It doesn't matter. Alec had things to do. Hello, darling. Too bad you didn't get back for the party. Maida, any other wife would tell him what she thinks of his rudeness. I'm not any other wife. I'm Alec's wife, aren't I, darling? Yes. I thought you doctors were so diplomatic. You stand by and do nothing to smooth over a family difficulty. You're the diplomat-- better than I could be. That's more like it. Excuse me, will you? That wasn't very nice of you, Alec. I know it. As for your not showing up this afternoon... Yes? All I want to say is I understand. Understand what? If you don't like parties, there's no sense coming to them. I don't blame you. Even when we're alone, you can do it. What? Make it look as if I'd beaten you, and make me want to. We're dining early. I'm going out. For dinner? Yes. But your family! One scene's enough. Why should there be more? They might even find out the truth about us. They wouldn't believe it, dear. Yes. You've seen to that, haven't you? More coffee, Mr. Walker? No, thanks, Al. Just bring me the check, will you? Thanks. Hello. Hello. Surprised? How did you know I was here? I saw your car. I told you I had to see you. Now that you've found me, what about it? Honestly, Alec. You're so direct. You're not exactly oblique yourself. Don't you like me at all? I mean, not even the littlest bit? I think you're fascinating. You do? I've tried being decent, but it's no use. Why do you think I always avoid you? I can't eat or sleep. You're with me every moment. I can't go on like this. Oh, Alec, dear. Why weren't you like this long ago? It'll have to be a clean, sharp break. Break? Yes. I'll have to give Maida everything. I doubt Archie will give you alimony under the circumstances. Alimony? We'll have to ignore conventions and put up with certain penalties, and it'll be worth it. Of all the gall! Oh, but, Suzanne dear! Because I think you're attractive, you want me to throw my life away. What do you think I am? An Easter bunny. What? You call that love, huh? Who are you to be so high and mighty about love? You and that thing with Maida. Of all the shams, that's the worst. You didn't think you could make a fool out of me? I tried. You have to take me home. With pleasure. He hits him with two short lefts and another right to the jaw. There goes a hard one to his chin. He's down-- Left to his head, right to the stomach, and another-- Hey. Alec, look out! Ohh... Alec! Alec! Alec! Oh! Oh, help! Oh! There's been an accident! Could you help me, please? I think he's dead! Julie. Julie! Oh, it's Mr. Walker. Thank heavens he's still alive! I was so frightened. We'll need a doctor. Have you a phone? Yes. It's in the house. Oh, uh... I wonder if you'd mind phoning. There's a doctor at Mr. Walker's house. Dr. Gateson. He's staying there. It's sort of embarrassing. It was all perfectly innocent, but Mr. Walker's wife is my best friend. If people discover we've been together, there might be talk. So would you mind? No. No, of course not. The number is 5-8396. It might be better if you didn't mention my being here, just to avoid any misunderstanding. There's nothing broken. Might be a slight concussion. We'll know by the morning. I don't have to tell his parents tonight? John, give me a hand. Maida, get those car keys. Ok. Thank you so much for your help. I don't know your name. Eden. Julie Eden. Oh. Thank you again, miss Eden. He's all right. I told him to take it easy today. Come in. Well, you certainly were lucky, weren't you? Yeah, I suppose so. Alec, you must admit things have been difficult for me. Why... I know you feel I've failed you in certain ways, but you haven't helped. I don't mean to complain, but there's a limit. Meaning? Miss Eden. How do you know about her? Does that matter? I've seen miss Eden twice. Yesterday afternoon, we-- oh. So you've seen her before last night. Last night? Her sketchbook was in your car. It was obvious. You're barking up the wrong tree. I wasn't with miss Eden, though I wish I were. And who were you out with? Your dear--as she insists, "very best friend"-- Suzanne. Don't be childish, Alec. I have no illusions, but in this instance, she's innocent. Was miss Eden at the accident? You know she was. Did you talk to her? No. You probably didn't have to. I'm going out. To see miss Eden? To see miss Eden. This is a new development. What? You see what it makes me. People in our position... Maida... Do you realize what our position is? Don't change the subject, Alec. I'm not. It all ties in. You said you loved me when you married me. It wasn't true, was it? It was. Do you remember David Stoughton? What? I said, do you remember David Stoughton? Yes. Know what happened to him? He died. How? I don't know. He shot himself. Do you know why? How should I? He shot himself during our honeymoon. You'll say he did it because of me. Didn't he? He may have imagined loving me. Could I help it if he was so weak-willed? Where did you get this? His mother sent it to me. All right. It's true. I did love him. I was mad about him. What of it? How could you do it? I had a choice. I could take David and love and nothing else... Or I could take you and what went with you. I took you. At least we know where we stand-- both of us. Alec... I hope you don't think my telling you this will condone anything you do. I intend to see miss Eden whenever I can. Does that mean you're in love? She's the first person I've met in two years who makes me feel human again. Oh. Surprised to see me? Yes. Here's your sketchbook. I liked them. You did? Uh-huh. Must have been quite a mix-up last night. Wish I hadn't slept through it. Wasn't that dull, was it? Going to ask me in? This is a cleaning day. Oh. It was nice of you to cover up for Mrs. Duross. I hope somebody will do as much for me someday. I hope that won't be necessary. You never know. Look... Don't get the wrong idea about last night. The whole thing was an accident, including my being with Suzanne. She was the accident. That's something to tell Mrs. Walker. She wouldn't believe me. I wanted to tell you. It has nothing to do with me. It has. We were becoming friends, and I don't want that spoiled. There's nothing to spoil. That was yesterday, and that's over. How can it be over? I'm busy getting sketches off to New York. Would you mind? I'm terribly rushed. You don't want to see me again? Of course not. We'll run into each other. People usually do. But there shouldn't be any more picnics. Well, Mr. Walker, how was everything tonight? No complaints. Your checks for this last week-- $15.25. Thanks, Al. Here. Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Glad to see you coming regular. I like to have your kind of folks. Drop the word to your friends. When my friends start coming here, I stop. Good night. Good night. Laura, answer the door, will you? How do you do? Why, Mrs. Walker. Come in. It's Mrs. Walker, Julie. Good morning. A little thought for your kindness. It's late, I'm afraid. They're lovely! Won't you sit down? Excuse our looks. We're late getting at things this morning. Let me take those. Now nicely you fixed the house. We like it very much. You must think me inconsiderate, not having welcomed you to the neighborhood. Are you staying all summer? Another month, then to New York and work. Oh. Sketches? May I look? Oh, surely. Oh, they're stunning! I envy someone who can really do something. Really, these are beautiful! I'm glad you like them. I'm giving a party Thursday. I'd like you to come. Your sister, too. Between my work and house, I don't have time. You could manage. Really, I'm afraid... Make her come, won't you? I'll send a car for you. We're going to be very good friends. I know we are. Well...Good-bye, Mrs. Morton. Good-bye. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Ellen, this is Mrs. Walker. How do you do, Mrs. Walker? Oh, what a cunning child. Yours? Yes. Oh, I thought your name was miss Eden. I used it in work before I married. After my husband died, I took it again. Well, good-bye again. Good-bye. Was that Alec's mother? Really, Ellen! We're going to Europe. Alec and I haven't a notion what we'll do. Fishing, too. He'll love that. I'm counting on you. Here are your aspirin, Maida. Thank you, Ned. There. It'll be gone in a moment. Oh, dear. Didn't those powders help you last night? I'm self-conscious about getting sleep. What's worrying you? I'm just a little tired and nervous. What about? Oh, you doctors! Is it Alec? We missed you at bridge, Maida. I'll be there next week. It is Alec, isn't it? Oh, Ned. I just don't know what to do. Here, sit down a moment. Now, what is it? He wasn't alone that night of the accident. That girl-- that miss Eden was with him. How long has this been going on? For weeks, I guess. He never comes home anymore. You talked with him? Yes, but what can I say, Ned? I don't want to be a nagging wife. What did he say? "I'll see miss Eden whenever I can." Have you told his father? They couldn't believe it of their own son. Anyway, I wouldn't want them to know. He's getting so bold about it that they're bound-- I could stand it for myself-- that's where you're wrong, Maida. There's no reason why you should. Ned, please! Oh, mother. Mrs. Willoughby's been asking for you. Maida, my dear. Maida, why didn't you tell us? Ned, you promised. Let's not talk about it now. I'll never forgive you, Ned. Thank you. Hello there! Hello. Well, uh... Didn't your wife tell you I was coming? You don't think I go around crashing garden parties. Wait a minute! Oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Walker. Miss Eden, how nice of you to come. You've met Dr. Gateson. Yes. I don't suppose you remember me. Yes, I remember, miss Eden. Excuse me, Maida. My goodness, he's rather abrupt, isn't he? Julie, you'd better get out of here. It's too late for that. Please. Mother, this is-- sorry. Come, grace. Wait a minute, dad. Maida... Tell them you asked miss Eden to come. But I did. She came on my invitation. Really, she did. You needn't lie for him anymore, my dear. Julie! Please let me go! Here, get in. You all right? Please take me home. I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk. There's a lot you have to know. I might as well start now. I didn't know there were women like that. I only told you all this so you'd understand what happened today. I'm glad it happened. It changes a lot of ideas I had about you. I'm glad, too, because it brought us together. Have you so many friends you can't stand one more? I can't be friends with you. Why not? Let's not talk about it. Julie, why can't we be friends? Why? All right, because it wouldn't stay that way. With anyone else, yes, but not with you. Take me home. It's late, and we've driven a long way. I love you, Julie. No, you don't. You're just lonely. You're unhappy. No, darling, that's not true. Oh, Alec, please... It can't be this way. I won't do it to any woman, no matter who she is. I have a sister. Her home was broken up. Maida never loved me. Darling, suppose there were no Maida? Supposing there never had been? But there is! But if I were free-- let's forget we ever met. Let's do anything not to get us into something that will hurt us all. Please take me home. All right, darling. I'll take you home. I should have talked to Alec. No, dear. Maida's right. This is the best way, father. I'll have a talk with him and find out how things stand. I want to talk to you. Must it be tonight, Alec? I have a splitting headache. Sorry, but it must. Where did you go? I took your mother and father back to town. I might have known you would. Maida, I've asked you several times for a divorce, and you've refused to give it to me. I'm not asking you now, I'm telling you. Either you get one, or I will. I'm giving you the chance to do it the way that will be easiest for you. Funny... I was so sure. I thought I could keep you somehow. Didn't care how I did it. I never thought... And now I've lost. Well, I must admit, I'd expected more of a-- more of a battle? Why? The battle's over. Now that it is over, I suppose I ought to wish you happiness, but I don't. I hope you'll be miserable. I hope you'll both be miserable. Yes, that's more like you. No, I can't. I won't go to Reno. You'll get your divorce, but I won't subject myself to all that publicity, make a gossip's holiday for my friends. No. No, I'll go to Paris. You can't avoid talk if you go abroad alone. I could go with your father and mother. They're leaving on labor day. They probably won't go when they hear about us. Why do they have to know just now? I'll tell them when I get to Paris. That's my job. But oddly enough, they consider me a satisfactory daughter-in-law. I'd like to tell them that I haven't been. All right. All right, if that's the way you want it. But understand, I don't intend to let anything interfere with it. I'm selfish in a lot of ways, Alec, but even my worst enemy couldn't say that I'm stupid. I know when I'm beaten. What can you tell mother and father after today? I'll tell them we had things out and everything's fine. Maida, in certain respects, I admire you a great deal. You needn't bother. I'd do the same thing again if I thought I could win. Mm-hmm. That's what I mean. Good evening. I'm the census man. May I come in? Thank you. May I kiss you? I told you not to come. How many females in here? Three. That's good. How many males? None. That's bad. Can you cook, sew, take care of a man? Got to know before I give you a license. Will you marry me? I can't marry you. I asked Maida for a divorce. I told you-- she agreed, so you and I can get married. By the way, I start work on Monday. That's all settled, isn't it? It isn't settled. You heard what I said. I didn't pay attention. Where's your sister? Please go before she comes back. Only one thing could make me go, Julie. If you said you didn't love me. All right, I love you. I'll scrawl it on fences-- "Julie loves Alec." And what will it get either of us? It could get us arrested. I told you yesterday how I felt, and I meant it. Whose life are you living, yours or your sister's? I'm trying to live my own if you'll let me. That's just a lot of words. Can't you see words don't make sense anymore? This is my sister Mrs. Morton. Mrs. Morton, I've got to make you understand-- make him go. I can't go until you realize-- I said make him go. Alec, please. I'll wait for you downstairs. If you don't come down in five minutes, I'll come get you. Don't worry, Laura. I'll send him away. You're doing what she did. You're breaking up a home just as mine was broken up. I hate you for it. You've become so-- you think I don't know what I've become? I used to enjoy life as much as anyone. Look at me and ask how you can do what you're doing. I am looking at you, and I'm realizing for the very first time what's changed you. It's not the woman Phil ran off with. It's Phil himself. It's not having him with you. It's knowing you'll never have him with you. And if I send Alec away, I might end up just like you. But, Laura, I'm not going to send him away. I was, but I've changed my mind. He's getting a divorce. We're going to be married. They were out of grapefruit. I had to get oranges. Laura, please try to understand. I'm leaving, Julie. Leaving? Where are you going? I'll go to a hotel tonight. Stay here until Alec and I are married in the fall. Say good-bye to Ellen for me. Tell her... Tell her anything you think best. Laura, please stay! Julie, can you hear me? I'm waiting. Are you coming down? Yes, darling. Wait for me. Your father told me you would check these. Hmm? He did? Seems to be afraid I'll go stale while he's gone. Yes, sir. Oh, Mrs. Duross is here, sir. What does she want? She came to go to the boat with you. She did? Tell her to wait. Certainly a bear for punishment. Hello. Well, well, well. Darling, I've sold those sketches! I've got the check in my hand, and you should see it! Nothing like having a wife that can support you. Put it in the bank. I may need lunch money. Put it in the bank, nothing! I'm going to buy my veil with it. Oh, I suppose I can't wear a veil, can I? Well, then, I'll buy a hat, you know, all covered with fruit and seaweed. Mm-mmm. Sounds very practical. Bilious, but practical. What? Yes, the magazine offered me a job in Paris. Well, I've always wanted to go there. Oh, of course not. I said I had a personal reason for not going, and he said I was missing the chance-- who's babbling? You are! I've got to get to the boat. I'll call for you around 2:00. It's none of your business where we're going. Did snow white know where she was going? Yes, darling, every hour and every minute. Bye. Well, good morning. If that was Maida, you've changed a lot. Little pitchers, big ears. Who is she? I haven't the remotest notion. She calls me every now and then, and we talk. I call her my telephone dream girl. Very funny but not very true. Ahh... Oh, Suzanne, that's the trouble with your generation. You're so skeptical. Where's your sense of romance? We've got to get under way. What are you doing after the boat sails? How about lunch? Sorry, previous engagement. You better call it off. Why? Because I might tell Maida a few things. She might decide not to sail, after all. Suzanne, you wouldn't. Surely, you wouldn't. When the cat's away, the mouse will play. It might be a mouse, it might be a rat. Why can't it play with me? Oh, good morning, Suzanne. Well, are we ready? Ready? Remember, I gave you your chance. Here you are, my dear. Alec, I think a toast is in order. To a successful trip... And a quick return. I can do better than that. Here's to all of us just as we are. Funny. I've never seen you cry before. Well, don't be upset. I'm not crying over you. Go on back. There's no reason for a good-bye scene. I want to thank you. It's so sporting, the way it is in books. Or prizefights. I suppose I'm interrupting what is undoubtedly a most touching farewell. But, Maida, darling, I hope your going abroad won't be a mistake. A mistake? To go away and leave such a fascinating husband loose. I don't like to tell you this, dear-- I won't want to hear it. I wouldn't feel comfortable if you didn't hear it. There's someone in particular whom Alec intends to see while you're away. I know it. Don't forget to get left on the boat. Now, honestly, Maida, you're not going to let that girl take Alec away from you, are you? What do you think? Really, Maida, you're marvelous. Bye, dad. Don't worry about the office. It'll still be there when you get back. Bye, darling. Stay sober. Good-bye. Know where we are? Valley forge. No. That's a joke. Do you know why I said it? Because I knew I wasn't even warm. Get it? It's ours, Julie. I bought it back. Come with me. Well-- well, what's happened? This is our house. It wasn't good enough before. But you liked it. You picked it. But it's all so different. Everything's different now. How do you like it? Why, I...I... I knew you would. I mean, I hoped you would. I wasn't sure about the wallpaper. Like it? Yes. What's the matter with it? It will be lovely. Oh, it will? Oh, it is lovely. The world would be a better place if men didn't buy wallpaper. And women didn't buy neckties. It's a deal. Come. I'll show you where the animals sleep. Pardon me, madam, do you snore? No. Then I'll buy an alarm clock. Darling, it's wonderful! A kiss for each room-- should have built a hotel. You can change the wallpaper if you like. Yes. Funny, it looked nice rolled up. The man said-- what did the man say? I'll show you Ellen's quarters. Girls don't have quarters. They do until they get better halves like you and me. Oh, Alec, she'll love this! Just about big enough for her and her pony. She hasn't a pony. You never can tell what people may have. Alec, what's this? Oh, I thought someday we might need it. Why, Alec. I mean-- I only thought-- the architect said-- I told him-- why, darling, you're blushing. I am not. I've never seen a man blush before. Well, you're seeing one now. You're cute. I'm not cute. I'm only... Well, I'll have it torn down. You'll do nothing of the sort. That's for Ellen's room. I love this wallpaper. This will be a special room. I'm shaking like a leaf. If an empty room does this to you, what will happen when it's occupied? I'll open the window. There's Fred, the gardener. I've got to talk to him. Hey, Fred! Oh, hello, Alec! Beautiful day. Beautiful. Where are the chrysanthemums? I don't know. When are you going to transplant them? No chance, Alec. What? Mrs. Walker don't want them touched. I want them transplanted down here. We ain't got a chance. She told me that next spring-- if that's your orders, I will. Those are my orders. All right. Beautiful day, isn't it? Fred doesn't know two things-- that I saw that jug and that the other house will be sold. What's the matter? You shouldn't have bought this house until you sold the other one. We haven't time. We'll be in here by Thanksgiving. We might even be here by Halloween. Mr. Alec Walker calling Mrs. Alec Walker. Ritz hotel, Paris. Go ahead, please. Hello, Maida. This is Alec. How are you? What about the divorce? Yes. Another two weeks? Well, you know how long it's been. Why shouldn't I be impatient? All right. All right, fine. Give my love to mother and father. Good-bye. See you later. What did you think of the game? We did all right. Famine's over. Come on. I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. I doubt if they serve them. However, we'll try. Alec... How nice. Hello, Suzanne. I think you two have met. Yes. How do you do? This is Mr. Graham, miss--i don't remember your name. Eden. How do you do? Howdy. Where have you been? I haven't seen you for years. Here and there. Consomme? I had a card from Maida. She's having a marvelous time. Mr. Walker's wife has been abroad all fall. Steak all right? I suppose you're lonesome. Green salad? And coffee. She's staying longer than she planned, isn't she? Dessert? Cheese or something? The strongest they have. It must be hard on you. You know Mrs. Walker, don't you? Yes. Isn't she lovely? She's my best friend. She's an extraordinary person, Maida is. So...Well, so tolerant, so understanding. She understands you, doesn't she, Alec? Bring a sharp knife with that steak, will you, please? Archie doesn't understand me, does he, Paul? Archie understands you, Suzanne. He's just tired. Don't you drink? No. How do you stand it? Alec has such a sense of humor. He needs it. When you're on the receiving end, it's not so funny. I'd like to hear your views on that, miss, uh-- you're on my coat-- miss Edam, in about a year from now. I'd like to hear your views on some other things, too. Love, for instance. Good-bye, darling. Glad to have met you. A beautiful personality, that. What does she mean, Alec? She meant no good. No. I mean, "love, for instance." Darling, don't pay any attention to Suzanne. She's always got her claws out. I know her. Maybe she knows you better than I do. Maybe Maida knows you better than I do. Maybe I don't know you at all! Darling, what-- Julie, you didn't mean what you said. What am I supposed to believe? In August, it was just a few weeks. Now it's Christmas, maybe. How long is it going to be like this? She's running into legal red tape over there. All we can do is wait. It's been four months, and we're where we were when we started. Do you think I like it? It can't be much longer. It can be as long as she wants it to be. Julie! Can't you see it's no use? Go away and let me have some peace! I can't stand any more! I've had enough! Stop that, Julie! I'm not going to let you give up! Hello. No. No, I didn't ask for the carleston hotel in London. I asked for Mrs. Alec Walker at the Carleston hotel. Oh, well, all right. Put them on. Hello. Yes. Yesterday? Well, where did they go? Well, how does it happen they didn't leave a forwarding address? Oh, all right. Thank you. Now, stay there, you little angel. How's that? Straight? Ellen? I see. Hello, Mr. Walker's private office? Yes, it's me again. How your voice has changed. It's so long since we've talked. It was only an hour. I'll be over as soon as I get a package for you. What's in the package? Ask him how his cold is. How's your cold? It's only a sniffle. Hear? Use your handkerchief. Pffff! When you can blow like that, you'll be somebody, and tell your beautiful mother not to be so beautiful until I get there, hear? Stay where you are. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Oh, ho ho! Look at him. You ought to see your face. Hello, mother. How are you? Well... I'm sort of bowled over. Maida said we'd make your best Christmas present. Merry Christmas, darling. I had to convince them I was your father. But we were determined to have Christmas Eve with you. Oh. Oh, well, I'm terribly sorry. I can't stay. What? I wish you had let me know. It was my fault. I'll come in the morning. Oh, but, Alec... I had other arrangements. Can't you tell them your family's here? They'll understand. Dad, I'm sorry. I can't. It's a shame, but we should have cabled. At least we can have a drink. Sure. Well, it seems our little surprise wasn't very successful, was it? Apparently not. We'll have a nice Christmas Eve then see Alec in the morning. What about his... Why don't we give them to him now? Your Santa Claus speaks with a French accent. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'm awfully sorry about this. Hello. Isn't this where Mr. Walker lives? It is? There's a lady there. Don't be silly. He's fooling you because you pester him. Hello? Who's calling, please? Oh. How do you do, miss Eden? This is Mrs. Walker. May I have Alec call you back? We're having cocktails now. Or if you'd rather, you can call later. We'll be in all evening. Hello? Merry Christmas, darling. Laura. Aren't you going to kiss me, Julie? Oh, darling, forgive me. You were right, and I was so wrong, but I understand about you and Alec now. I want to wish you the best because you deserve it. I was so hateful to you, and I know it, but, well... I've changed, Julie. You see, I... Well, Julie, I'm going to be married. His name is Jackson. He lives over in Jersey with his sisters. I was on my way there now, but I just couldn't go without stopping by to-- oh, Julie, I'm so happy. It's sort of funny, isn't it? I mean, the way I was and the way I am now. It isn't funny. It's wonderful, Laura. Wonderful. And you're happy, too, aren't you? Things haven't changed? No. I mean, yes, I'm terribly happy. Will Alec be here tonight? I expect him any minute. Did his wife get the divorce? Not yet. That is, not quite. It's just a matter of a few weeks. I've expected to hear you'd been married. I'm glad you weren't. Now I can be there. When is it? Well, we haven't quite decided yet. We were sort of waiting and... Julie, is anything wrong? No, nothing's wrong. Will you stay with Ellen? Darling, I have to go. Aunt Laura. Ellen, darling. Ellen, where's your mother going? I don't know. I know it was mistake not telling you, but you shouldn't feel this way about me because I love Julie. I don't know what Maida has said to you about my life with her, but the fact remains-- I'm in love with another woman. All I ask is that you see my side of it. As you say, I have my own life. Yes? Thank you. That's water over the dam. It's still hard for me to realize that you can't understand what she means to me. Where's Alec? I said, where is he? I wish you hadn't felt it necessary to do this, miss Eden. I'd expected better taste of you. I want to talk to Alec. Alec understands he should spend Christmas Eve with his wife. Are you going to give him a divorce? I think by this time, it's obvious what my intentions are. Julie. Alec, dear, she's been lying to you. I know. You didn't think I'd let you go. I'm leaving for Reno tomorrow. The moment you file for divorce, I shall file a countersuit. I don't care what you'll base your suit on, but I'll base mine on infidelity, and it won't be any vague other woman. It will be one woman, by name. You understand, I think. I'm warning you, miss Eden. Alec isn't the only one I'll sue. I'll sue you for alienation of affections. You have a little girl, haven't you? How old is she? You'd better teach her now how to behave on a witness stand because she'll be there. You must be out of your mind. Oh, Alec. God, thank you for the day that's done. Watch over me for the night and keep me from harm, and god bless aunt Laura, Alec, and most of all, mother. Shall I say anything about Christmas? No, darling. Amen. I'm not sleepy. You will be. Good night, darling. Mother? Yes, dear? Who's the man aunt Laura's bringing? I don't know. I've never met him. Well... I hope he's as nice as Alec. There's a perfectly good dinner going to waste out there. Well, I'm afraid I can't do anything about it. Here's your present, Julie. I don't want to see it. Why not? Why look at something you can never wear? She can't stop us. Can't she? Be honest, Alec. You know there is nothing too cruel, too vicious... We never had a chance, not from the beginning. Look, dear, you're tired and upset. Let's wait and see if tomorrow-- we've been living on tomorrows for the past six months. This is today. This is all we're ever going to get. I can't go on fooling myself! The magazine still wants me to go to Paris. Now there's no reason why I shouldn't. I'll take Ellen. I can put her in school. Julie. Please go. Go now, while we still love each other. Let's not give Maida that satisfaction. I love you, Julie. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. No, operator, I didn't ask for bayside 9-2901. I asked for bayside 9-2901. Scotch, please. Then bring me a hot toddy. Hello. Is that you? Well, this is Charley. I just called you up not to wish you a merry Christmas. Did I not wish you a merry Christmas? No, you didn't. Well, I don't wish you a merry Christmas. I don't wish the same to you, either. My pal. Have a drink on me. No. You have one on me. Let's both have one on each other. All right. Barkeep, two triple scotches. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. This is Mr. Walker. Is my apartment still occupied? Wake her up and tell her I'm not coming home. I wonder if she'll tell. Who? Your wife. Tell who? My wife. What? Where I am. I hope my wife doesn't know your wife. My wife knows everybody who'll tell her where I am. I better go home and face her. Are you coming home? No. You don't care what happens tomorrow? Tomorrow? No more tomorrows. No? Well, then I'm ok. Whew... Hot. Ooh...Stuffy. Turn off the heat and open a window. * * * * * * here you are, sir. Oh, keep the change and give him half. Thank you, sir. Merry Christmas. Whew! Ahh... * joy to the world, the lord is come... * drunk and no luggage-- might be another suicide. Why didn't you report this earlier? Well, sir, I thought he might just be asleep. With all that racket? Fine chance. The door between the rooms is locked. Come on. Put your shoulder here. * he rules the world with truth and grace * * and makes the nations prove... * brrr! Get some heat on in here. Yes, sir. Hey! Wake up! Just as I thought-- out cold. Tell doc Hastings to come up here quick. Tell doc Hastings to come up to 1524. Gee. He sure pinned one on, didn't he? Everybody did last night. Not a dime. Somebody must've cleaned him out. I want you to witness this. Check his coat. All right. Well, well, well... Another happy hangover, huh? He's still out, doc, and I don't like the way he's breathing. You better get in touch with somebody who knows him. This guy's sick. Where's he from? New York City. Here's something... A Christmas card he didn't mail. See if there's a party named Eden at 5 west 10th street. Tell her to get here in a hurry. Well, it's about time. I thought I'd try whiskey treatment. You gave it a fair test. How do you feel? I don't know. I... What is this place? A hotel, and you certainly do pick them, too. How did I get here? You floated in. Here, take this. Why? Because I want you to. What's it for? What you've got--the flu. I've got the flu, huh? Flu...Well... Don't worry. You'll be all right. I didn't have these on, did I? I hope not. What time is it? 4:00. 4:00, what? 4:00, Christmas day. Oh, sure. Merry Christmas, darling. Merry Christmas, darling. I think maybe this is going to be the best Christmas I've ever had. It's one you won't forget. Don't go. I thought maybe you were leaving. Julie. Yes? You make a swell nurse. Thank you. If you don't let me take care of you, I'll send you to the hospital. I don't want to go to the hospital. I don't have to go, do I? You'll be all right tomorrow. Julie... Yes, darling? Let's not think about tomorrow. We won't. Go to sleep. No... I don't want to sleep. I like it just the way it is. If I sleep, I...I'm afraid I'll miss part of it. Hope I didn't disturb you. What is it? It's about the bill. It's two days now, and your friend paid the first day, but since he has no luggage-- just a moment. Oh, I didn't mean you should pay. I always hate to take money from a woman, especially one so, eh, good-looking. Please. Ok. Afraid I haven't got the change, though. Think you can trust me? Just leave it at the desk. You must get lonesome here. How about a little nightcap? No, thank you. He's married, isn't he? Yes. You an actress? No. Now, look, can't we be a little friendly? I mean, sometimes when you've got the blues, it helps to have a shoulder to cry on. Get out. Don't excite yourself. Get out! You'd think she was your wife. Alec! Oh, what a mess. What an awful mess I got you into. You've got to go back to bed. Get away from here, Julie. You don't have to stay and take things like that. I want you back in bed. I got to get away, too. Alec, please do as I tell you. I've got to get out. Please, for my sake, get back into bed. That's all I ask of you. Then if you want me to, I'll go. It's time you did what's best for yourself. Yes, I will, darling. If you don't, I'll do it for you. You shouldn't be here, Julie. It's not good, your being here. You've got things to do. You've got to go to Paris. You ought to be getting ready now. I want you to go to Paris, Julie-- you and Ellen. Ellen...I want you to take Ellen and go to Paris... Get me Dr. Hastings. Oh, then get me Dr. Edward Gateson. He's in the book. Tell him it's Mr. Alec Walker, and hurry. Please, hurry. I understand why you didn't send for me, but you might have thought of his condition. The doctor didn't tell me it was pneumonia. It's not too late? He'll be all right, won't he? I don't know. It won't be necessary for you to come. I want to be with him. I've called his family. There's been too much time lost already. What's the number of Mr. Walker's room? Mr. Alec Walker. Who is calling, please? Miss Eden. I'm sorry. Dr. Gateson left orders-- no visitors. Mr. Walker's room. I'm his father. 802. Has Dr. Muller come in yet? He's with Dr. Gateson now. Mr. Walker... Who's Dr. Muller? A consulting specialist. Will he leave this way? Yes. May I wait for him? Sure, but I don't know how long. His mother was very upset, so I told her not to come unless we thought it was absolutely necessary. But if we should-- Richard, this is Dr. Muller. Mr. Walker. How do you do, doctor? How is he? I always believe in absolute honesty. Your son is in a serious condition. It's a bad case of pneumonia. What? What are his chances? Physically, good I should think. I should say a little better than a 50-50 chance. Mentally-- by that I mean psychologically... Not nearly so good. What Dr. Muller means is that Alec shows no desire to get well. Exactly, and it is our business to find someone who should give him that desire. His mother-- I've explained. His wife's on the way here. Good. Is she the "Julie" he keeps calling for? Well, no... You see... You see, doctor, it's rather a difficult situation-- family complications. I'm sorry to be blunt, Mr. Walker. I'm not interested in family complications. As a physician, I am interested only in the patient's complications. I don't say that this Julie is our answer, but she is the only clue we have. Do you know where she is? I left her at that hotel. She was downstairs when I came in. I see. I imagine she will still be there. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, miss. They want you up in room 802. Oh, dear. Come in, please. Dr. Muller, this is miss Eden. How do you do? How is he, doctor? Our patient wants to see you, miss Eden, and I think all I need tell you is that his chances of recovery depend upon your seeing him and upon what you say to him. Dr. Muller, you don't realize-- you don't need to worry. We won't see each other anymore. We both know it's hopeless. Does he think it is hopeless? Then it is necessary that you get rid of that thought for him. You must tell him that there is hope. In fact, that there is certainty. Tell him whatever you think he wants to hear. If you think he wants you to say that you love him, then say you love him. If you think he wants to hear an obstacle to that love has been removed, then tell him that it has been removed. Tell him... I think you know what to tell him better than I do. Alec... Alec, dear. Can you hear me? It's Julie. Julie... Julie... Go away, Julie. Darling, everything is going to be all right. Julie's all right. Julie's gone to Paris. You don't understand, darling. This is Julie. Everything is going to be all right for us. Oh, do you hear me? For you and me. You're going away. No, Alec. I don't have to. I'm not going to Paris. I've thought it all out, and nothing matters now, except us. She can do anything she likes, but she can't keep us from loving each other. Only you've got to get well. You're only telling me this because I'm sick. Please, get well. You've got to get well. Tell him. Say something. Alec. Look, Alec, it's your father. He'll tell you, too. Father? Yes, son. Is it all right? Yes, son. You wouldn't fool me, would you? No, darling, and you will try, dear? You will try to get well? I'll get well. Is that what you wanted? I, uh... I'm sorry it-- it has to be this way. Your house telephoned, Mr. Walker. Your wife said she's coming down anyway. Oh. Where's Dr. Gateson? In his office. You can take the stairs. Room 706. 802? The first door. Thank you. Wait. Please don't go in there. How dare you? Alec is very ill. He may not live, but if he does live, it'll be because he believes he'll never see you again. And how did you manage that, miss Eden? I've told him that you won't fight us, that we can be married. You think it's that simple? Oh, you needn't worry. His father was there. He knew it was a lie. Everyone knew it was, except Alec. You've handled this very skillfully, miss Eden. You've made it look as if Alec's life depends on you. I admire your ingenuity, but it won't work. You'd rather see him dead than with me. Yes, I would. You don't love him. You don't love anybody except yourself. I gave up love for what I've got. You won't get it from me. Alec will give you money. If Alec gave me every cent he has, it still wouldn't be enough, but someday his father will die. Oh! She wants to keep me out. She-- you'd better take what you can get from Alec because you won't get anything from me. He's asking for you again. Oh, Alec, darling, everything's going to be all right. I thought you told me that...Before. I must have been dreaming. We were both dreaming, darling... But now it's true.
