Calico Jack: HEH HEH. WELL, I GUESS I CAN TELL THE STORY AS WELL AS ANYONE. YES. YOU SEE, IT WAS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO, BUT, OH... IT FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY. YOU SEE, THERE WAS A KING... A GOOD KING, MIND YOU... WHO RULED OVER A KINGDOM BY THE SEA. THE KING WAS HAPPY THERE, AS WERE HIS PEOPLE... NO DESIRE TO VISIT FARAWAY LANDS AND TRAVEL THE WORLD. AH, BUT PRINCESS SERENA, THE KING'S ONLY DAUGHTER, WELL... SHE WAS ANOTHER MATTER. Man: UHH. [GASPS] WHAT WAS THAT? [SERENA GASPS] SIR... SIR... CAN YOU HEAR ME? [COUGHS] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? OHH. OHH. MY CASE. WHAT? MY CASE. BE CAREFUL WITH THAT. YOU... OHH. THANK YOU. IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE? IS THAT A BOOK? OHH! WHAT ARE THESE? WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU? UHH. HOW... HOW DID YOU DO THAT? SOME THINGS ARE BEYOND THE UNDERSTANDING OF A MERE... GIRL? CHILD. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE QUEEN. REALLY? YOU CAN STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT, BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM AND HOW YOU MAKE YOUR MEDICINES AND... YOU'RE AWFULLY... INQUISITIVE. HMM. EVERYBODY SAYS I'M TOO CURIOUS FOR MY OWN GOOD. I NEED TO DRY YOU OFF AND GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT. DO YOU LIKE SEAFOOD? I AM SEAFOOD. EXCUSE ME? NEVER MIND. ARE YOU ALWAYS SO KIND TO STRANGERS? FATHER ALWAYS SAYS THAT SUSPICION MIGHT SAVE YOU ONE GOLD COIN. TRUST WILL EARN YOU 2. YOUR FATHER SOUNDS LIKE A VERY WISE MAN. I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM. FATHER! FATHER! I WAS OUT AT THE POINT. HE WAS WASHED UP. HE'S A PRINCE FROM A PLACE WHERE THEY'VE LEARNED TO... CALM DOWN, SERENA, BEFORE YOU SCARE YOUR NEWFOUND FRIEND AWAY. HE WAS NEARLY DEAD WHEN I FOUND HIM, AND NOW... WELL, LOOK AT HIM. YOUR MAJESTY. SHOW HIM WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR POTIONS. SHOW HIM HOW YOU BROUGHT YOURSELF BACK TO LIFE. FATHER, HE WAS NEARLY DEAD. SERENA, PLEASE LET THE MAN SPEAK. MY CREATIONS ARE NOT SOMETHING I ORDINARILY SHARE... WITH ANYONE. BUT SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER DID SAVE MY LIFE, I WILL MAKE AN EXCEPTION. ALL MY POTIONS ARE DERIVED FROM SEA WATER, THE SOURCE OF ALL LIFE. THIS, FOR EXAMPLE, ENABLES A PERSON TO SEE MORE CLEARLY. THIS IMPROVES MEMORY, AND THIS EXTENDS LIFE. I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THE ONE FOR MEMORY, SO YOU CAN REMEMBER MY BIRTHDAY. THIS ONE... OFFERS LONG LIFE? I RECOMMEND... 2 DRAMS, TWICE A DAY. I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW OLD I AM. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? WHAT SOME CALL IMPOSSIBLE IS ONLY THAT WHICH HASN'T BEEN IMAGINED. ANY SIDE EFFECTS? QUICKER WIT, MILD EUPHORIA... TO LIFE IN ALL ITS FORMS. YOUR MAJESTY, IF THE PROSPECT OF LONG LIFE IS DAUNTING TO YOU... TO A LONG AND HAPPY REIGN. OHH! TASTES... AWFUL, ISN'T IT? IT'S MADE OF SLIME SCRAPED FROM STONES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MANAGE TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE... AHH! FATHER? [GAGGING] OHH! UHH! Serena: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STOP THAT! I COMMAND YOU! GUARDS! GUARDS! OHH! OHH! ARREST THIS MAN! ARREST? THE KING? [VOICE DIFFERENT] MY DAUGHTER IS CONFUSED. Serena: HE STOLE MY FATHER'S BODY! THIS WIZARD CAST A SPELL ON HER AND TRIED TO POISON ME. HE'S THE ONE WHO CAST THE SPELL, NOT... NOT HIM! I SAW THE WHOLE THING. TAKE HER TO HER ROOM AND KEEP HER THERE UNTIL THE SPELL WEARS OFF. HOW DARE YOU! THROW HIM INTO OUR DEEPEST DUNGEON UNTIL I DECIDE HOW HE SHOULD DIE. NO! Guard: BUT... SIRE... DO IT! TALK TO THEM, FATHER! FATHER! BRING HIM BACK! I WANT MY FATHER BACK! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM? DARLING, PLEASE CALM YOURSELF. FATHER! LOOK. IN THIS BOOK... HIS POTIONS AND HOW HE MAKES THEM. DARLING, PLEASE. HE LIED TO US. LISTEN TO HIM. SWEETHEART, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IS THAT MY FATHER'S VOICE? IS IT? FATHER! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM? WHY, YOU... CONFUSED LITTLE GIRL. STOP HER! IF WE DON'T FIND MY DAUGHTER SOON, SHE MAY HARM HERSELF. WHEN YOU FIND HER, PAY NO ATTENTION TO HER RAVINGS. JUST BRING HER BACK. SEE HER? HUH. THINK YOU'RE THE KING, DO YOU? WELL, RULE THIS, YOUR MAJESTY. OHH. OHH. [DOOR LOCKS] ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT? HE'LL GET THE DROP FOR SURE. [DIFFERENT VOICE] SERENA? SERENA. PLEASE... COME CLOSER. HOW CAN... HOW CAN I BE SURE... SURELY... YOU KNOW YOUR OWN FATHER... NO MATTER HOW I LOOK. SERENA, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. I'M NOT SURE WHAT I SAW. I'M NOT SURE OF ANYTHING ANYMORE. MORNING GLORIES ARE YOUR FAVORITE FLOWER. PURPLE IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR. YOU LOVE PEACHES. YOUR FAVORITE HOLIDAY IS... WELL, IT USED TO BE... OH, FATHER. [DOOR OPENS] YOU MUST GO. IF HE FINDS YOU HERE... I HAVE THE PAGE FROM HIS BOOK. I THINK I KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE POTION TO UNDO THE SPELL. WHEN I GET IT, I'LL COME BACK. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. HURRY. AFTER HER! YOU MEN, THAT WAY! YOU, OVER THERE! FOLLOW ME! [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Man: WATCH IT! YOU, THAT WAY! GO! CAN'T HAVE GONE FAR. ALL RIGHT, CHECK THIS WAY. THIS WAY. OVER HERE. Guard: ANYTHING? Guard: NOT YET. Guard: CHECK THAT CORRIDOR. WELL, SHE CAN'T HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED. Man: GUARD! Guard: LET US CIRCLE AROUND. Guard: ALL RIGHT. Guard: WE'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE, SIR. Guard: I'LL GO BACK AROUND. Guard: NOTHING HERE, SIR. LET'S SEE. UH... AHA. [LAUGHS] HMM. I SUPPOSE THIS WILL HAVE TO DO. EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT WOULD YOU MIND IF I BORROWED YOUR CLOAK? [MUTTERS] I'LL BUY IT FROM YOU. [MUSIC PLAYING, PEOPLE CLAPPING] [MAN LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING, PEOPLE CHATTERING] Serena: THE SHIP I SAW THIS AFTERNOON. I WONDER. [LAUGHS] [MEN CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Man: NO MORE DRINKS FOR THAT TABLE. A TOAST... TO CALICO JACK. [BOTTLE BREAKS] Man: HEY, I WASN'T DONE WITH THAT. WELCOME TO CALICO JACK'S. WE WILL WELCOME YOU. COME IN, LITTLE GIRL. I WANT TO HIRE THAT SHIP. WELL, THAT SHIP BELONGS TO SINBAD. WHERE CAN I FIND HIM? WELL, SINBAD DON'T WORK FOR HIRE... ONLY WORKS FOR HIMSELF. WHICH OF YOU IS SINBAD? Man: OH, SINBAD. Man: DO YOU KNOW WHERE SINBAD IS? I AM. [LAUGHTER] I AM SINBAD. OH, YOU ARE NOT. Both: WE ARE SINBAD. Man: ME, TOO! I AM. [THUD] I SUPPOSE YOU'RE SINBAD, TOO. IT DEPENDS WHO'S ASKING. THE DAUGHTER OF KING CHANDRA. RIGHT. A PRINCESS. [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER] UHH. I'LL TAKE YOU FOR A SAIL, MISSY. HOW DARE YOU! UNHAND ME! Man: THAT'S ENOUGH. LET HER GO. [BELCHES] WHY? Man: UH-OH. WELL, FOR STARTERS, YOU'RE DRUNK, AND SHE'S... CONFUSED. [LIQUID SPLASHES, MEN YELLING] UHH. OHH. [BLOW LANDS] Man: IT'S A LEFT, A RIGHT, AND THEN A LEFT, A RIGHT. OH, THEY GET THIS WAY EVERY TIME THEY COME IN FROM A VOYAGE. HA! LOOK AT THEM... LIKE BROTHERS. Man: GET UP, SINBAD. GET UP. OH, HE'S COMING UP THE STAIRS. OH, NICE. NICE ONE. OH, AND HE'S... OUT OF THE WINDOW IN UNDER 2 MINUTES. HA HA HA! [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER] A NEW RECORD. Calico Jack: OH, SINBAD, SINBAD, SINBAD. SORRY ABOUT THE WINDOW, JACK. AHEM. NEEDED CLEANING ANYWAY. HERE... FOR DAMAGES AND DRINKS. THIS IS TOO MUCH. I OWE YOU MORE THAN I CAN EVER PAY. OH, COME HERE, YOU SENTIMENTAL IDIOT. NOW GET OUT OF HERE. GO ON. THE PRINCESS HAS JUST BEEN... SPOTTED IN THE VICINITY OF CALICO JACK'S. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO! HELLO. EXCUSE ME. YOU'RE SINBAD, AREN'T YOU? WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA? YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THERE WHO DIDN'T CLAIM TO BE. I REALLY DO NEED YOUR HELP. YOU JUST GOT MY HELP. MY FATHER'S IN JAIL. GET YOURSELF A LAWYER. HE'S BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH. GET A GOOD LAWYER. YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? THAT YOU NEED HELP? HA. NO OFFENSE, BUT ANYBODY WHO THINKS SHE'S A PRINCESS NEEDS A LOT OF HELP. I DON'T THINK I'M A PRINCESS. I AMA PRINCESS. I CAN PAY. HOW MUCH? WELL... I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THESE THINGS COST, BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT? EH, I'M SORRY. I DON'T DO DAMSEL IN DISTRESS. REALLY? NAME A PRICE. YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD. DONE... AS SOON AS WE'RE THROUGH. WAIT! COWARD! HA HA HA! I'VE BEEN CALLED WORSE BY BETTER. GOOD LUCK GETTING WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING. GOING TO THE EDGE OF THE EARTH IF I HAVE TO! I DON'T KNOW WHAT BOOKS YOU'VE BEEN READING, SISTER, BUT THE WORLD'S NOT FLAT. HASN'T BEEN FOR YEARS. BUT IF YOU WOULD LISTEN TO ME, YOU WOULD... TRUST ME ON THIS ONE. DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT? I NEED TO GO BEYOND THE VEIL OF MISTS. IT SAYS SO RIGHT HERE. THE VEIL OF MISTS? THE VEIL OF MISTS IS A... IT'S A MYTH. IT'S MAKE-BELIEVE. IT DOESN'T EXIST. WAIT. PLEASE, COME BACK. SINBAD! I COMMAND YOU! DO THAT AGAIN. ONLY THIS TIME, STICK YOUR LIP OUT AND STOMP YOUR FOOT. [LAUGHS] YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL. I DON'T CARE. I JUST WANT MY FATHER BACK. SO, SINBAD... YES? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHUT UP. GET IN. AH, THERE HE GOES AGAIN. HA HA HA! SENTIMENTAL IDIOT. WHERE IS SHE? LOOKING FOR YOUR WIFE AGAIN? UHH! IF YOU THINK I'M TELLING THE LIKES OF YOU ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING... Serena: I'LL BE BACK, FATHER. UHH! A POX, A PLAGUE, AND A PANDEMONIUM ON THE LOT OF YOU... ESPECIALLY YOU! I NEED TO KNOW WHERE SINBAD IS TAKING MY DAUGHTER. THE KING ASKED YOU A QUESTION. HUH. THAT'S FUNNY. THE WAY SHE TELLS IT, THE KING'S ALL LOCKED UP AND BEING FITTED FOR THE HANGMAN. HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY, YOU IMPERTINENT BARKEEP! PFFT! TAKE HIM AWAY! HEKYLL, JEKYLL, GIVE ME A LIFT. UP WE GO. OOH! EASY. HA HA HA! UHH! [DOOR CLOSES] YOU AIN'T HEARD THE LAST OF CALICO JACK, YOU HEATHENS! [SPITS] WHO'S THERE? WHO'S THERE? IDENTIFY YOURSELF. COME, STRANGER. THAT VOICE. WELCOME TO MY CELL. OH, SIRE. THOSE SAVAGES HAVE GOT YOU CHAINED. OH, YOUR LITTLE GIRL WAS RIGHT. YOU'VE SEEN HER? AYE, THAT I HAVE. SHE CAME MY WAY LOOKING FOR HELP AND FOUND IT. SHE'S GONE TO SEA. IS SHE SAFE? WELL, IF SHE'S STILL WITH SINBAD, THEN, YES, YES, SHE'S VERY SAFE. Man: I MAKE THE BEST SALTFISH THIS SIDE OF THE BAY. DO I GET ANY CREDIT? NO. I JUST... OOH! OHH! OOH! WHAT AM I, INVISIBLE? HMM. SORRY ABOUT THAT. HUH. WOMEN. [YAWNS] GOOD MORNING. GOOD AFTERNOON. WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE WAKE ME? UM, WE WERE BUSY SAILING A SHIP. UH, ABOUT MY CLOTHES... YES? I WOULD'VE PREFERRED CLEAN. CLEAN'S JUST A SCRUB AWAY. FEEL FREE TO USE THE WASHTUBS ANYTIME. IS IT TOO LATE FOR BREAKFAST? "IS IT TOO LATE FOR BREAKFAST?" Sinbad: MOOK! WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE IS FRESH CREAM AND PEACHES. OOH, SO WOULD I. WHAT DO WE HAVE ON THE MENU TODAY, MOOK? WE HAVE SALTFISH, BISCUIT, AND PEAS, OR WE HAVE BISCUIT, PEAS, AND SALTFISH. I THINK I'LL WAIT FOR DINNER. [SPLASH] OH, SALTFISH IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US, BUT NOT FOR HER MAJESTY? MOOK'S CONVINCED SALTFISH HAS STUNTED HIS GROWTH. MOCK ALL YOU WANT, BUT I AM STILL TWICE THE MAN OF MEN HALF MY SIZE. HMM? WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP? I THINK WE'VE PRETTY MUCH GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL. I INSIST. I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE IN A SEASIDE KINGDOM. A REGULAR SISTER OF THE SALTY SEAS, HUH? WAIT! OK. HERE. HOLD THIS. HOLD IT TIGHT. TIGHTER. [STRAINS] LET HER HIGHER INTO THE WIND!

ALL WE WANT IS WHAT WE NEED TO GET HIM BACK. WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN? BARAKA? HE IS NOT A MAN LIKE YOU. HE IS... HE'S ONE OF YOU, ISN'T HE? MY BROTHER. MY BROTHER WAS ALWAYS DIFFERENT. HE DREAMED OF DOMINATION. HE COULD NOT STAY AMONG US. HE WENT ABOVE THE WATERS. TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM. UNTIL TODAY, THEY THOUGHT YOUR KIND WERE A MYTH. CREATURES FROM TALES WE TELL OUR CHILDREN. MOSTLY... TO SCARE THEM. BUT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER KNOW ALL ABOUT US. THEORIES AND GUESSES. THEORIES AND GUESSES WOULDN'T HAVE TAUGHT YOU OUR LANGUAGE. HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH? [CHIMING] WOW! AMAZING. THIS PLACE, IT'S... MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT YOUR KIND, WE LEARNED FROM THIS. Sinbad: SHIPWRECKS. Sinbad: A MUSIC BOX? YOU DON'T HAVE MUSIC? ONLY THE MUSIC OF THE SEA. OF COURSE. Serena: SINBAD, THIS WRECK IS FROM THE ROYAL FLEET. ARE THOSE... MY MOTHER AND FATHER. SO THIS IS HOW BARAKA LEARNED OF YOUR KINGDOM... HIS CHANCE TO RULE. YOU'RE HURT. Sinbad: SERENA, THAT SCRATCH ON YOUR ARM, IS THAT FROM THE SPIDER? MMM! Sinbad: LET HIM LOOK AT IT. DO NOT BE AFRAID. WE HARM NO ONE HERE. THAT IS OUR WAY. IS THIS THE POTION I NEED? HEALED! LIKE MAGIC! [SINBAD AND SERENA GASPING] YOU CAN BARELY BREATHE. YOU HAVE SO LITTLE TIME. FOR MY BROTHER. THANK YOU. I AM SORRY. ESPECIALLY FOR WHAT MY BROTHER HAS DONE. Sinbad: THANK YOU AND GOOD-BYE. Serena: SINBAD, LOOK! JUMP FOR IT! Sinbad: WE'LL HEAD FOR THAT WHIRLPOOL! UHH. CAN WE GET HOME ON THIS? Sinbad: WELL, I WAS TRAINED MORE AS A SAILOR THAN AS A...

WE OFFERED THIS STRANGER FRIENDSHIP, AND HE BETRAYED US. [CLEARS THROAT] WE GAVE HIM FOOD, HE GAVE US POISON. HE REPAID OUR KINDNESS WITH CRIMES. I COULD FORGIVE HIM FOR TRYING TO KILL ME, BUT NEVER FOR WHAT HE'S DONE TO MY DEAR DAUGHTER. THE DEAR, DEAR GIRL WHO SHOULD HAVE AND WOULD HAVE BECOME... YOUR QUEEN. Guard: DO YOU WANT A HOOD? SINCE THIS IS HIS FACE, NOT MINE, I WANT THE PEOPLE TO WATCH HIMDIE. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT? IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US! LOOK! WHAT IS IT?! DO IT! NOW! I SAID DO IT! Guard: IT'S STUCK. ALLOW ME.
