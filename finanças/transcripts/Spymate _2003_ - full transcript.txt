(Native language) (Native language) Ah, Mr. Muggins. So nice of you to drop in. In exactly three minutes, this missile will launch and detonate as the world leaders are meeting for their peace summit, huh? Huh? Aah! Ohh... Waah! Aah! Thanks, Minkey. You set the charge. I'll get the detonator. All right. Come on, let's go. Minkey, come on. (Native language) Come on, let's go! Which way? Whoa! Too close. You know, I think it's time that I leave the spy business. I've got a daughter I have to raise. Don't worry, pal. You saved my behind more than once. I'll make sure you end up in a place that's safe, a place that you like, where you fit in. Mike. Minkey. It's okay, Edith. Mission accomplished. We're coming back. Amelia, breakfast is ready. Coming! Good morning, Dad. Good morning, Darling Girl. What do you think? Perfect. I could never understand how you and your mother could eat burnt toast. Look at this. Minkey made the front page. The circus must be in town. I should take you to meet him. Right, Dad. Minkey the chimpanzee... That was your spy partner. Dad, I stopped believing those stories when I was eight. Those stories are true. You're an insurance salesman, remember? Right. Right. How could I forget? So, are you excited about tonight? I guess. A little nervous, though. Amelia, you should be nothing but proud of yourself. It's a very big award. Couldn't have built it without you. I think you could've done it all on your own. I know. It's just that I'm going to be meeting Dr. Amour today. She's the most amazing person in the world. And to top it off, Dr. Farley's going to be there, too. Mm-hmm. It's crazy. Two of the most famous scientists in the world are gonna be there... and I'll get to meet them. Well, I'm excited. Love you. Hey... I love you more. Hey guys. Hey. Wasn't sure if you were gonna be at school today. It's not 'til tonight. Are you excited? More scared. We're all coming. You guys don't have to. Are you kidding? You're the only kid to ever win the National Scientific Achievement Award. We're coming. Yeah, Amelia, we're coming. Cool. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I shall introduce you to the stars of our show. Are you all ready? Our lovely leading lady, big in size and heart... Betty The Human Bowling Ball. (Gibberish) The strongest man alive... Melmar The Magnificent! Who will win this challenge... Man or machine? Here's Lightning! Don't blink. You'll miss him. Yoo-hoo! Next is Fly, a trapeze performer like no other. And last, but not least... The star of our show... The one and only... Huh? The phenomenal... The amazing... Minkey! Minkey! And hup! Yeah. That was great. Oh, no. Aah! Aah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah. That's our Minkey. Liquid levels in propellant chamber... Check. Open propellant valve. Check. Oh, blowback. And the National Scientific Achievement Foundation has been providing scholarships ever since. Pleasure to meet you, Dr. Farley, Dr. Amour. Greetings. Hello there. Bonjour. Comment ça va? Yo. What up? Ohh... Excuse me. Are you the young lady with the oxygen iodide chemical laser drill that we're awarding tonight? Professor Farley! Ah, ah, ah. Ha ha. Dr. Farley. Oh, yes. Dr. Farley. A pleasure to meet you. It's my pleasure, Miss Muggins. Is Dr. Amour backstage as well? No. Dr. Amour won't be joining us tonight. Oh. Well, you know, your work in plasmaphysics and in magnetic fusion... It's just, well... It's really an honor to meet you. I know. Is your family here tonight? Yeah. My dad should be here soon. I'm gonna need his signature if you're gonna go to the think tank tomorrow. Yeah, um, here. He did already. And now I feel very privileged to introduce our honored guest. Here to present the National Scientific Achievement Award tonight... Dr. Robert Farley. Excuse me. Well done, Doctor! And now, for her revolutionary design of an oxygen iodide chemical laser drill, the award is given to Miss Amelia Muggins. Way to go! My daughter. Yeah, Amelia. Whoo! And now, Miss Muggins, would you be kind enough to give us a demonstration and explanation of your groundbreaking device? Sure. This is my favorite part. Oh, yes. This is a chemical oxygen iodide laser drill. The chemical laser drills into the ground by eating through it and turning the rock and soil into a gas compound largely composed of oxygen. Basically into O2, breathable air. We could pretty much put an end to conventional drilling. Because of its chemical nature, this drill has the ability to go a lot further and a lot deeper than any other drill in existence. It's also environmentally friendly. May I ask a question? Will the physics of your prototype translate perfectly to an industrial application 100 times its present size? It would be very expensive to build in real life, but, yes, it should work just as I described. I can't wait to see it in action one day. And now, it is my honor to present the National Scientific Achievement Award to Miss Amelia Muggins. Yeah! I love you. Fantastic. Terrific, Honey. Miss Muggins. Oh, Dr. Farley. Mr. Muggins, I presume? Yes. Dr. Farley, it is a pleasure to meet you. You know, I am so proud that Amelia has won this award. It is such an honor. Well, she's accomplished what most MIT graduates have been attempting for ten years. Well, look at the time. I really must be going. Miss Muggins, my limo will be at your house at 7am sharp. Right. Thank you for having her along on this think tank. She has been talking about this all week. She is so excited to be spending a whole day with Dr. Amour. And also you. Dad. Dad. Great to meet you. Come on, let's go. Really nice. It's my pleasure. She is so excited about spending the whole day with Dr. Amour. A-And also... And also you. Got it. Hey. What a day, huh? Your mother would've been so proud of you today. I wish I remembered her better. Oh, she was just like you. She was beautiful and she was smart and she was funny. Kind of like Dr. Amour? Yeah, just like that I bet. I really wanted to meet her today. Well, you'll meet her tomorrow at the think tank. Yeah. You better get some sleep. You got a big day tomorrow. Good night. Hey, Dad. Hiya, Sweetie. Hey, look. Look who made the front page. Wow. That's my girl. Gotta hurry. Miss Muggins, there you are. Let's go. We got a tight schedule. Mr. Muggins, good day to you. Oh, Amelia, listen, have fun, be good. I love you, okay? And I'll see you tonight. Amelia, I have a surprise for you. I've been working on a top-secret project. Really? Yeah. I built a full-scale model of your drill. We're gonna use it to extract the greatest energy known to man from the Earth's core. Wow. Yeah. Did you and Dr. Amour build it together? Yeah. Sure, sure. Wow. I'm really excited to meet her. You'll meet her soon enough. Actually, she's working on the drill as we speak. Where is it? In Japan. That's where we're going right now. Japan? I think I should call my dad. Oh, please. Miss Muggins, your father knows all about this. He wanted to surprise you. In fact, I've got him on a satellite feed right now. Hiya, Honey. Japan. Hey, that's cool. I didn't wanna ruin the surprise. Listen, have fun. I'll talk to you soon. You're a big girl now, so you'll be fine. Okay. But, Da... Bye. Dr. Amour is really looking forward to meeting you. Miss Muggins, this hydrogen-propelled watercraft is gonna take us to Tokyo faster than any airplane ever could. Wow. You run along. I'll be there in a second. I told you she'd be putty in our hands. She never has to know anything is wrong. What did you expect? She's just a kid. Now you stay behind. Make sure that doofus father of hers gets the package, then keep an eye on him. That shouldn't be too difficult. Don't harm him, Hugo. Just watch him. Don't harm him, you understand? Completely. Yo, yo. Morning, Edith. Hi, Phil. See you tomorrow. Who's this from? I don't know. Mr. Muggins, I've taken Amelia out of the country, so you will not be able to reach her. She'll be helping me with a top-secret project. Do not call the police, for I promise I shall have her returned unharmed in approximately one week. If you do contact anyone, you will never see your daughter again. Huh? That is all. This message will self-destruct in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Edith, looks like we're back in the spy business, and we have our most important mission ever... Saving Amelia. Hey, it's Edith. Mike's come out of retirement, so I could really use some help setting up here. Keep it going, people. Bring it in, bring it in. One last thing... you gotta look the part. Hey, old friend. Ow. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Listen, Partner, I, uh, I need your help. It's my daughter Amelia. She's been kidnapped. I think we've gotta go back in the spy business to get her back. So what do you say? They're coming. Oh, they're coming. Oh, they're coming. Minkey, is that you? We heard everything. Can we help? Sure. I guess we can use all the help we can get. Boys, get the cycle. Mink? Oh, Minkey. Oh, these are Minkey's friends. They volunteered to help us. Now, I didn't have much time, but I managed to wrangle up some new gadgets from some of our old contacts. This is the standard-issue Agency laser pen. It will eat through all known metals. And those are the newest glasses on the spy market. They have several viewing options. And if I do say so myself, they look really groovy on you, too. Yes, and that is the new electro paintball gun. Ooh... whoo. Whoa. It also shoots a dart attached to a 1,000-pound test line. This is what we know so far. That Amelia was taken by Dr. Farley, a world-renowned scientist. Nobody seems to know his whereabouts. This is Dr. Amour. She was supposed to be along at the think tank today with Dr. Farley and Amelia, but as it turns out, she was not. She is vacationing somewhere in Jamaica. Jamaica it is, then, Minkey. Ooh. Miss Edith, I know he's got important work to do, but before we start, can you tell us how Minkey became a spy? Okay. Here, quickly, I'll tell you. Mike was working for The Agency, a secret underground spy network. The Agency was experimenting with a new program called Project Spymate, which was training primates to become agents. The plan was to combine human agents with the power and agility of a higher primate to create an unstoppable team. The Agency tried to train several chimps, but one stood out from the rest. Ready? 3, 2, 1. He would become a secret weapon with phenomenal physical and mental abilities. But for some reason, The Agency got cold feet, and Minkey ended up in storage with the rest of the discarded inventions. Mike was assigned the job of disposing of Minkey. The Agency wanted to make sure Minkey didn't get into the hands of the Russians. The KGB had intelligence on this phenomenal chimp and were trying to nab him. I get man, you get monkey. Nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet. Thanks. And... after Minkey saved Mike's life that day, The Agency let him keep him as his partner. Until they retired together, they were the most successful agents in the business, and that's when Minkey came and joined you all in the circus. Now, we had better get to work. ♪ Yes, I am, yes, I am, yes, I am ♪ ♪ Yes, I am, know I am ♪ ♪ Native language ♪ ♪ Yes, I am ♪ ♪ Native language ♪ ♪ Yes, I am ♪ ♪ Native language ♪ Hi. I need some information about one of your guests... Dr. Claudette Amour. Sorry, Mon. Info about the guests is strictly confidential. It's a... very important matter. I'm starting to feel the love. Bingo! Just seen her sashaying by, heading towards the beach, Mon. All right. That's great. Minkey, we've gotta go to the beach. Minkey? Is this where Dr. Amour is? Dr. Amour went up to the drill site already. You'll meet her soon enough. I'm sorry to disturb you, Dr. Amour. My name's Mike Muggins. Uh, merci. My daughter's been kidnapped, and I need to talk you about your partner Dr. Farley. Oh, I'm so sorry, but Dr. Farley is not my partner anymore. He's not? No, Mr. Muggins. Dr. Farley and I had a serious disagreement, and we no longer work together. Her name's Amelia. Amelia Muggins? Yes. Oh, mon dieu. This cannot be. He has gone through with it. Dr. Farley, I figured out why the father's in Jamaica. Hugo? Hugo? Darn it. I lost him. Dr. Amour and I were hoping that you could look at our calculations, give us your opinion. You want my opinion? Well, sure. You're the one who invented the drill, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, we're experiencing some technical difficulty, and we were hoping that you could help us figure out where we've gone wrong. The project was to rid Japan and even the world of its dependence on oil. We were going to drill into a volcano and tap into the Earth's core energy. I soon realized it was much too dangerous, and I tried to convince Dr. Farley, but he would not listen. Sure, I'll take a photo. What has Amelia got to do with it? Something must not be functioning properly with Amelia's drill, and they need her to figure it out. Hey, Sleeping Beauty. Wake up, mon. Huh? It's time to get down to the rhythm of the islands. ♪ Island music ♪ You got no chance, 'cause this chimp can dance. Yahaa! I call this one the cha-cha chimpanzee. Bug about, move the hand, move the hand, body, body, body. Shake the little chimp, people. Uh-oh. Blecch. One peace, one love and plenty banana. Aye, Mon. If Farley gets the drill running before we find it, he will likely force the Earth's core to open, causing a massive explosion. It could wipe Japan off the face of the Earth. There you are. Dr. Amour, this is my partner Minkey. Minkey, this is Dr. Amour. Enchanté. Minkey, we've gotta get to Japan now. Mr. Muggins, you will need my help. I've got it. I've got it. Mike, Mike... Mike. Go for us. I've got great news. I've located Dr. Farley's North American residence. I'm sending the circus gang on a recon. I'm calling it "Operation Road Trip." That is great news, Edith. We've got some information, too. We're here with Dr. Amour, and it seems pretty likely that Farley has taken Amelia to Japan. Japan. We're on the next plane to Tokyo. I'm gonna get that chimp. Miss Muggins, how's it coming? I'm trying to isolate the differences between the prototype and the larger drill. So far, nothing's popped up. Well, I have to go attend a board meeting, and then I'll check back in. Maybe something will have popped up by then. Oh, Dr. Farley? I was kind of wondering if I could talk to my dad after we're done working. Of course. Sure. Let's go. Yes, Sir. I so love to be a spy! Fly The Spy! Hello? Miss Edith? We are approaching our final destination! Hiya, Honey. I hear you wanted to talk to me before bed. Yeah. I just wanted to say good night. It's not much fun here. Oh, that's too bad. But it's an important project, remember. Yeah. It's just there aren't any other kids around, and I still haven't met Dr. Amour. Well, just suck it up. You'll be home soon once you find out how to fix that drill. I'm proud of you. Okay. We'll see you soon. Love you. (Japanese) (Japanese) (Japanese) This looks like the spot, Boys. Let's do it. What was that? Let's get him. Yeah, okay. Fly. Gentlemen, I realize that we're three months behind schedule. The thing is.. Enough excuses. We have spent 600 million on this project. Perhaps Dr. Amour was right. This project should have been canceled. Is the drill operational yet? If you'll excuse me for just one moment. Dr. Farley, it's me. I have bad news. They're in Tokyo... Her father, the monkey, and Dr. Amour. Dr. Amour? It gets better. I've done some research. The monkey has a name. Minkey the monkey. He was part of a top-secret Spymate project. The monkey and the father are ex-spies. All right, Hugo, you listen to me. I want you to watch them carefully. I'll have the girl out of Tokyo by the morning. Done. As I was saying, the drill is operational and will begin working by the end of the week. Good work, Dr. Farley. And now, if you'll excuse me, Gentlemen, I have a great deal of work to do. Where are the guards? They're still searching for me in the woods a mile yonder. Hee-hee. Come on. Okay, let's split up. Betty, Fly, check upstairs. Melmar and I will check down here. Don't mind if I do. Oh. Hmm. Ah. Mm-mm-mm. Go for Mike. That photo that Minkey sent of the guy who's been trailing you... His name is Hugo Dulton. Search shows he's ex-Agency. I'm posting the photo for you on the network now. Thanks, Edith. Good work. Where is Melmar? Hold it right there! What are you up to? Melmar. Huh? Nice work, Betty. Minkey? Where's Minkey? Grr... No, no, no, no. Aah! Aah! Taxi. 1075 Yento Street. Mike, I've got an update Operation Road Trip was a huge success. We've got Farley's Tokyo address. It's Pyramid Enterprises at 1075 Yento Street. Amelia, we have to hurry. The helicopter's on its way. You can finish your work at the mountain base. Helicopter? Cool. Are we gonna see Dr. Amour now? Yeah, yeah. You'll meet her soon enough. What are you doing? Sorry, Buddy. No hard feelings, huh? There you are. (Japanese) I have a delivery for Dr. Farley. Dr. Farley? Farley. (Japanese) Wrong floor. You must go back down to lobby. (Japanese) Sorry. My mistake. Go on in, Miss Muggins. Cool! I've never been in a helicopter before. Oh, good, good. Isn't this your lucky day? What happened to you? It's that darn monkey. He's highly trained. Look, I pay you a lot of money for your expertise. I think you can handle one little Pan troglodyte. Huh? Chimpanzee. Knucklehead. I can't believe you let them get this far. Now, you take care of the father. We're gonna need him as an insurance policy. (Japanese) Good work, Partner. We found them, but they got away in a helicopter. Oh, I'm sorry. The only good news is that Minkey went with them. I think he's with Amelia. Edith, they've left Tokyo with Amelia. Minkey's gone with them. Hmm... He seems to be headed toward Northern Japan's mountain range. Open the files I sent you. They'll show you where in the mountains he's headed. Great work, Edith. And thanks. I hope we find them. I've got it. That's at Mount Yarigatake. Yarigatake. Thanks. This is where you'll be working. Hello. I'm Amelia. Ah, so sorry. Must keep working. And this is your workstation. Nice, huh? Okay, follow me. And this is where you're gonna be staying for the next couple of days. Sir, there is something you need to see. Miss Muggins, if you'll excuse me. Why don't you start working? Sure. Play it back. Hold on. Enhance that image. I wanna see who that is. It must be that Pan troglodyte. Will somebody get rid of that flying monkey? No sign of anyone here, over. My apologies, Miss Muggins. That's okay. Is Dr. Amour here yet? No! No. No. No, I have... No. I have knowing that you wanna meet Dr. Amour, and I know strongly that she's at the mountain and the drill site. Okay. Look to your north. I see it. I hope that's where Amelia is. I have brought you some food. I am Kiro-sensei. Minkey-san, I know why you have come here. You have come to save the girl, but you will also be saving all of Japan. We have been expecting you. Yeah! Dr. Farley, I figured out the problem. Oh, that's fantastic. What is it? Well, it's not very scientific, and I should probably show you and Dr. Amour together. Will you forget about Dr. Amour? Just tell me. Can I speak with my dad? Um... Is that a yes? Yeah. Yeah. I'll, uh... I'll arrange it. Oh, no! Mike Muggins. Not much of an Agency spy, are you? And, Miss Amour. So nice to see you again. Now is the time to prepare you for the battle ahead by helping you find the power within you. This will be the challenge of your life. (Japanese) (Japanese) (Japanese) (Japanese) Enough. Ooh... Hmm... Ohh... Ah. Yes. Ohh! Ahh... Yeah. I guess if I had to look on the bright side, he's leading us to Amelia. She's lucky to have a father like you, Mr. Muggins. We've lost all contact with Mike. That's not good, right? What's the plan? Well... Minkey has asked for an airdrop of supplies... Spymate, this is Condor. We are over the drop site. Over. Okay, Condor, drop the egg. Hiya, Honey. I hear you wanted to speak with me? Something weird is going on here. Miss Mug... Amelia, you've always had an active imagination. Just fix the drill so you can come home, Honey. Oh, Dad? Yeah? Sorry I complained about the burnt toast the other morning. Aw, don't worry, sweetie. We all hate to eat burnt toast. Now get back to work and make us all proud. "We all hate to eat burnt toast"? This is so weird. Stupid kid. Hello, Amelia. We all hate to eat burnt toast. I've got to get out of here. (Japanese) Miss Muggins, how nice of you to rejoin us. (Japanese) So, Minkey-san, it is time. We shall all leave at sunrise. (Japanese) Now, Minkey-san, from here, you must go alone up the treacherous north face of this mountain. That way, you can go undetected. When you reach the peak, we believe there is an opening. No one would expect anyone to make this climb in this weather. Even a ninja would not make this attempt. (Japanese) Where are we going? To the drill site. It's at the bottom of one of the largest craters in Japan, a volcano. You fix the drill, I'll let you go home. Wow, you really did make it! Yeah. Now. Let's talk about how you got the drill to work. Not until I talk to my dad. My real dad. Fine. I'll even let you see him in person. Bet you didn't expect that, Miss Smarty Pants. Come on, let's go. Dad! Oh, Amelia, are you all right? Dr. Amour? Mm-hmm. What's going on? Amelia, Dr. Farley is going to use your drill to bore into a volcano, but this will cause a massive explosion. Massive explosion. Oh, come on. Never gonna happen. I'm about to capture the greatest energy known to man. The world will finally discover who the greatest scientist of the millennium really is! The names Albert Einstein and Robert Farley will be spoken in the same sentence. Massive explosion. Oh, puh-lease. Amelia, hundreds of millions of people could be killed. But Dad, that's not what I invented it for. I know. It's supposed to help people. It could help many people, if it was used properly. All right, enough of this. Miss Muggins, if you ever wanna see your father alive again, you'll show me how to make this drill work properly. Now let's go. (Japanese) All right, Miss Muggins, what's it gonna be? And don't you forget... I, too, am a scientific genius. You've got one minute to tell me how you got this drill to work, or your father's toast. It's because of the sympathetic resonance caused by blowback from the catalytic chamber. I see. All right, what's your solution? Well, I used my elastic hairband to dampen out the vibrations, constricting the flow of chemicals so the drill won't overheat. I told you it wasn't very scientific. This better work. Come here. We have to recreate the modulus of elasticity of this hairband with a hundred times the force. You got 30 minutes. (Japanese) Miss Muggins, stay right here and watch. Oy! (Japanese) (Japanese) (Japanese) (Japanese) I hope, for your sake, this works. At last, your invention will make me the greatest scientist of the millennium. Hugo, we've got it. You can dispose of her father... And the soon-to-be-late great scientist. Consider it done. Au revoir. Time to take a walk. Not without my daughter. Oh, "Not without my daughter." Come on, Daddy-o, let's go. Very funny, Muggins. Minkey, help untie us. Oh, no, they started the drill. Come on. (Japanese) (Japanese) (Japanese) Hmm... Let's see if I'm still in Farley's system. Farley. Dr. Amour? Oh, Farley... I realized what a horrible mistake I made when I left. I really want to be a part of this, and I am so excited to see that it has finally come to life. But-but I thought that you... No. How'd you get in? Where's her spy dad? I got rid of him. I just used him to get back here. I needed to come and tell you how sorry I was. I think you're the greatest scientist of all time. 3, 2, 1. Huh? All right, Mr. Spyman. That'll be quite enough of that. Nobody messes with my daughter. Amelia, quick, shut off the drill. Here we go, Partner. You watch my back, I'll watch yours. Thought you could use some kick-butt... Assistance. Let's rock 'n' roll. It's not working. We can't stop it. What? I've got it. The elastic band. It was just a temporary solution. We can cause it to overheat and explode before the laser reaches the core. Exactly. That should do it. Let's get out before it blows. Come on, Minkey. We gotta hurry. Hey! Get back here! Get back! Cowards! The drill will work! That was close. Oh, no! Avalanche! Go, go! Yaah! Look. Cool! Bravo! Bravo! Yeah! Oh, Amelia. Oh, I'm so happy you made it. I love you. Mike, Minkey, hello. I say again, can anyone read me? Mike, Minkey. Edith, we're okay. We're coming home. Oh, good. Ha-ha. I can finally change. Ah, Master Minkey-san, thank you very, very much. Oh, Minkey... I want you to meet my daughter. This is Amelia. Dad, we already met. Right. Dr. Amour. No, no, no. Please, call me Claudette. Claudette. Wow. I guess I owe you another one, Pal. You really are a spy. Yes, I really am. Spymate, do you read me? Spymate. This is the President. I hear you're out of retirement. That's great news. Your country needs you for a top-secret mission. Air Force One is standing by in Tokyo for you. What do you say, Minkey? Are you in?
