C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, pick up. C'mon, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Guys, hello? Um, it's Caroline, I, I've, I fell. Um, I went back down the trail we hiked yesterday and I, I think I, I think I dislocated my shoulder. Um, can somebody come get me? Hello? Lauren? John? Hello? Ah! Mm. Shit. Okay, okay. Okay. Ooh! - Caroline, where are you? - Oh my God, Lauren. - Thank God. - What's going on? Tim and John went looking for you. I fell, I fell off an overlook. - What? Where? - I went back down the trail - we hiked yesterday. - Oh my God. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I, I, I'm fine. I, my, my shoulders hurt, but I'm okay. What happened? You said you fell? Yeah. You said the guys are looking for me? Why did you... ...by yourself, - ...why? - Lauren? - Lauren, I'm losing you. - You know we have - really bad ser-- - Lauren? I said, why did you go out all alone? You know service is really bad. I, I brought a walkie-talkie. You're probably out of range, those things cost like $4. Okay. - Where are you now? - I, I couldn't climb back out, but I'm looking for a way out. Okay, well... [cutting out] come, find... we're, we're... - ...over here-- - Lauren? - Lauren, hello? - Car-- Where-- Carol-- Fuck! Lauren? Lauren, are you there? John? Tim? Anybody?! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? My name is Caroline Hale, I'm lost. I was hiking near the Rose Ridge Loop and I fell, I need help. Can anybody hear me? My name is Caroline Hale, I'm lost. I was hiking near the Rose Ridge Loop and I fell, I need help. Can anybody hear me? My name is Caroline Hale, I'm lost. I was hiking near the Rose Ridge Loop and I fell, I need help. Can anybody hear me? My name is Caroline Hale. Dot, dot, dot. Line, line, line. Dot, dot, dot. Dot, dot, dot. Line, line, line. Dot, dot, dot. Dot, dot, dot. So if that's the river and we set up camp here, the trail, okay, so that means I fell here? And I stayed along the ridge, so I need to go south? Okay, so... south. My name is Caroline Hale, I'm lost. I was camping off of the Rose Ridge Loop. I'm hiking south, trying to get back to camp. If anyone can hear this, I need help. Fuck. No. My name is Caroline Hale. I'm lost. I'm somewhere within a two day hike of the Rose Ridge Loop. There's a big tree with a double trunk and lots of bare branches, it looks like a tree from a horror movie. Um, if anyone can hear this, please respond. I need help. Hello, is somebody there? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Mm. Hey! Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Pick up. Ooh! Whoa! Woo! Lost? See, not far at all. How long have you been up here? Just a few days. Can I get you a beer or something? I got a bear canister a little further up. I'd give anything to eat. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure, hold on. Here. - Thank you. - No problem. Good? Mm. You can sit. Thank you. Oh. Oh. You really out here by yourself? Mm-hm. Good thing I found ya. Sorry, I'm-- I haven't had a conversation in like a week. It's all right, I'd be the same way. So how'd you lose your friends? Mm, it's stupid, I, um, I went for a hike alone and I fell. I couldn't get back up to the trail, and I got turned around. - You radio for help? - Oh, no, this thing is useless. Mm, actually I should call Lauren. Do you have a phone I can use? There's no service up here. Right. Could I? Oh, yeah. - Thanks. - Sure. So you're a hunter? What? No. I, yeah, I mean, technically, I haven't shot anything yet, so. I used to go with my dad when I was a kid. I hated it back then, but I'm warming up to it. - You wanna hold it? - Oh, I'm okay. No, come on, I'll show you how to fire it. No, no, really, I'm, I'm, I'm fine. Sure. I'm just wasting ammo out here anyways. So then where are we? Oh, [groans] um, around here, between this trail and this lake. That's... God, how did I get so far? No wonder they couldn't find me. Must be a fast walker. - I'm gonna take a piss. - Mm. Hello. What's that? Oh, yeah, you know, it's getting pretty late and my car is a bit of a hike. So, I think it'd probably be better if you just stay here for the night and, and I can drive you into town first thing. I can cook you dinner, you can get some rest. I'm okay actually. Don't worry about it. Oh, here, I can take that. Fire starter. Um, are you sure we shouldn't go? I mean, I, I'm really fine. No, it's getting late. Well, I'm sure we can make the hike before sunset. Yeah, but once I drop you off I still have to come back. Right, yeah, yeah. It's fine, really. You're more than welcome to stay here tonight. It'll be nice to have the company. Okay. Chili good for dinner? I think I have an extra can. Sure. Better than a granola bar? Uh, yeah. Thank you. I got a deck of cards in the tent. Thought it might be fun for after dinner. Yeah, maybe. So, Caroline Hale, what do you do when you aren't getting lost in the woods? I work in customer service. - How's that? - It's a job. I'm, I'm in IT, I mean, I was. I don't know, I'm sort of between jobs at the moment. But it's nice, you know, being able to come out here. No commitments. How long have you been up here? Couple weeks. And you said you haven't shot anything? Not yet. I like tracking, but mostly I just watch. My dad always used to get mad at me for not taking the shot. Fuck him. So how does that work if you're not hunting? Do you have to go into town to get supplies? Yup. How far is it? I don't know, 10, 12 miles? Still hurts? It's, it's fine. Um, you finished with that? Yeah. - How was it? - Uh, good. Oh, we should probably turn in early. That way we can catch the sunrise. Uh, didn't you say you had a deck of cards? You wanna play? Might be nice. You wanna grab 'em? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Um, we can deal with these later. Be right back. Everything all right? Yeah, just need to pee. Can I borrow this? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. - Thanks. Don't go too far. There's animals. I'll be careful. Hey, I said not too far. Hey! Hey! Caroline, Caroline? Oh my God. Stay away from me. You didn't stop. - Why didn't you stop? - Oh my God. Here, here, give me your hand. - Get the fuck away from me! - I'm trying to help you! I found your walkie-talkie! I know you've been following me. - Get the fuck away from me. - Caroline, Caroline, Caroline, stop it. Stop, Caroline. Okay, you have to let me help you, okay? You don't have another choice right now. How far is it to your car? We have to stop the bleeding. Ah, here, here, put this on it. This is bad. I, I, I can make it to the car, I just... I need, I need something to tie this down. It was an accident. - Just get me something to keep the-- - Okay, just... you know it was an accident? Shit. Shit. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Why didn't you stop? I, I won't say anything, I promise I won't say anything. I have to think. No, no, I have to go to the hospital. You have to take me to the hospital. Just give me a minute. There's nothing to think about, you have to take me to the hospital! Please be quiet. You have to take me to the fucking hospital! We have to leave right-- I said I need to think. Caroline? Caroline? Caroline, come on, knock it off, you're gonna fall. Wouldn't that be nice. - What? - Nothing, I'm coming. - She was just standing there? - Yeah. See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Stop, it doesn't seem like a big deal. I don't know, I'm a bit concerned. She's fine, we all know she's just had a tough year. I know, I get it. But we're all responsible for each other out here. You don't think she was... No, no. John? No, I, I think she's just having a hard time. So maybe we should just, kind of, keep an eye on her, not let her be by herself. No, that's not, just give her some space, let her enjoy her time however she wants to. And we're here for her if she needs us, okay? Okay. Fine. Yeah. It's still bleeding. I have to go to the hospital. Are you gonna let me die? I spent this whole week just waiting. People always talk about dying like there's this clean line between life and death, but, when you think about the moment you'll die, whether it'll hurt, there's this in between space. You never think about that. I... I jumped I think. I don't know for sure but I've been thinking about it a lot and I think... I think I jumped. [crying] And I wish I hadn't. And if I'm gonna die somebody has to know that. Even if it's you. Why didn't you fucking stop? Why wouldn't you take me into town? You can't just leave me out here to die. People are looking for me. Are they? Someone will find me. They couldn't before. Please just, just drive me to the edge of town, I won't, I won't say anything, I promise. Please? The one time I take the shot. We both know I can find you.
