- Lisa? - Yes Yes. Sorry I didn't come to the airport. But I thought this is a better much place for our first... Encounter? Yeah. Coffee? I'll speak English if you don't mind. - I don't mind, my boyfriend is from Canada. - Oh right. Well his parents are from Jamaica actually. Let me start with the biggest cliché ever, you look like your mother. Apparently my mother was a blonde extra-large version of me yes. Apparently. You don't remember her? A bit, I was six when she died. Three when you left. Yeah, but she was indeed a blonde extra-large version of you. Yeah my grandmother said that all the time. Are your grandparents still alive? My grandmother is, she's more or less still okay in the head just old. And what did she say about you coming here? I didn't tell her. And you have a son? Yes, three - three years not three sons. - Oh right, yes. You have, any other children? No as far as I know, it's only just you. - Come. - Not another coffee first? No, there's plenty of time for coffee this week. You live in this neighbourhood? No, I don't live in Venice, but I have been here quite often. I was in the theatre group, puppets. Did you do the puppets? Sometimes. And I did the cocaine and I drove the bus and I played the music of course. So then I had enough and I went to Portugal. Portugal. How many countries have you lived in? I lived everywhere except Australia and Antarctica of course. Look, there is kind of curves here Here is where a young girl could leave her unwanted baby. And here she would get a half a picture of the Madonna. That was because, if they ever wanted to have the baby back... Well the children that were left there were trained to become expert musicians. Well, not all the children. Only the girls. They performed for the wealthy Venetians. In that time in Venice, there were four ospedale The most important of them, was the one we just saw. And that was because of the music teacher. Maestro Antonio Vivaldi. - You know him? - Of course. And the funny thing was, the girls playing in the orchestra were named after the instrument they were playing. So you could have Lucio Delbasso or Isabelle Del Violin, Del Violin? - Domenico? - Si. No, I'm fine. - Thanks. - The last one? You must help me to finish the bottle. No really, I'm okay. As the lady wishes. Baby. I'm drinking a little bit more than usual. That's because I'm nervous. Tomorrow, we take a train for a few hours. But, where are we going, where do you... We're going to Ljubljana in Slovenia. Because? Because I have to bring something to somebody. - What do you have to bring? - A package. This is not a five stars hotel, sorry. Well there's a bed. I'm not that much into luxury. But I still find it a bit strange that we're going someplace else tomorrow. Why, don't you like trains? Yes. But I do when I when I have a reason to go somewhere. Well I have a reason. Look, my room number is 301. If you can't sleep, just knock at the door and I'll tell you another story, right? I heard many stories today. Listen, I am the one who invited you here, I'm going to take care of you and have a great time. I know I have a responsibility towards you. - Yes, definitely. - Yeah. Right, and you are exactly like your mother. Good night. So, you're a mother. And what else do you do? You mean work? Yeah, for instance. I am a manager of a tapas restaurant, I buy the products and stuff and I must admit I'm pretty good at making special tortillas. - And I do judo, - Judo? - Why Judo? - Why not? Why not. I wanted to go to the Olympics, that never happened. But I did win the school tournaments, my grandfather was quite proud of me. I can imagine. - Is this the package? - Hm? - Yeah. - Can I shake it or will something explode? - Are you smuggling a bomb? - No. Ljubljana. Very good. Jesus I thought the Dutch were good with languages. Look who is talking. You lived in Holland for three years and you still don't remember the language. What? Darling that was 27 years ago, come on. The man I was looking for is not here. The package man? The package man, yes. But did he give you an address? Did he tell you where he is? He's not in Ljubljana. Where is he then? Novi Sad. Is that far? It's to the east. Can't you just leave the package here? No. I can't. Okay so, So what? So what's next? What's the plan? Well we go to sleep and then tomorrow we go to Novi Sad. I don't know yet. He talks a lot in stories and trivia. Yeah no personal things and I'm not going to drag it out of him. But you know my battery is really low and I'm going to call back in 10 seconds and don't pick up the phone okay? Yeah I know you're not retarded. Okay big kiss, sweet dreams. Bye, bye. In Zagreb we will change trains, I'll try to find some Paki sir the best cheese in Croatia. What's fun about not being sad? Is there anything about it? Well yes, but that will mean another story. Another story. Can't wait, let's have it. Good. Do you know the book Murder on the Oriental Express by Agatha Christie? This line through Croatia and Serbia is the most classical one. Probably because of the book. Agatha Christie wrote the book at the end of the line in Istanbul at the Pera Palace. Which is a wonderful old hotel, I'll show it to you. When will you show it to me then? When we get there. In Istanbul. We're going to Istanbul. Well that was my plan. No we're not. You're going to be back in Holland in time, I planned everything. Your tickets, everything. - You planned everything? - Yes. With the package and all? No the man of the package is Miko Berage, a friend of mine. I wanted to play with him. Yeah. Venice is going to be, it's going to be much too crowded anyway. Sorry. The next stop is going to be Slavonksi Brod. We're not going to be there before 30 minutes, come on. This doesn't make much sense to me. The reason express train leaving in one and a half hour There is another train leaving in 40 minutes, but it's going to stop everywhere. So it's going to take ages before it gets back to Zagreb. The centre of town is not far away. Maybe we can have a quick lunch. What do you say? You go if you want to, I'm going to stay here. Sure? When I was here with your mother, it was a cosy little town. - I didn't know you were here with my mother. - Yes. That was the summer of 1982, the summer of my life. Look, Italy was world champion, and I was on this epic journey with the love of my life. During the day we went to visit the towns along the track. But we couldn't afford an hotel. So for night, we just went for the night train. And we slept there in the, in the sleeping compartment, just the two of us. When we arrived in Istanbul, she had to fly back to Holland right away. Because she had to go to Spain with her parents, your grandparents. And I didn't see her for three months because in the meantime I was working on a cruise ship. So, now you're going to do the maths. Holy fuck! Yes. Holy fuck! Well, there is a train to Novi Sad leaving in 35 minutes and there is another one to Zagreb in 17 minutes. So, maybe we can make it. If we run. What's nearer, Venice or Istanbul? Venice. Much nearer? This is my place. When did you leave the old world? - Since I split up with Gabo. - Oh. So that was like five years ago. I like this house. I like old places. House needs experience. Come on, this is my garden. Hey, hello. A lot of people are coming from Belgrade you know. Friends of mine from Budapest too. Marta and Laslo, you remember Laslo? Yes, yes of course, I've been living with him in Vienna. - Really? - Yes a long time ago. I have to buy a lot of food, like feeding an orphanage. - Yes. - I can help you cook. Oh right, it's part of deal Also we are going to shop in the village. And we are throwing your father on hammock. In hammock. I arranged a nice room in hotel nearby five minutes by taxi please. It's better for you than sleeping here on couch. But I don't mind sleeping on the couch. I mean because of... No, no, it's no problem. I've been used to sleeping on couch. Tonight it's going to be big party. - So go to the hotel. - Alright you are the boss. So, how was your trip with your father so far? Um, different. I can imagine. So were you and Mauro lovers or just friends. Ha, Mauro is just my Mauro. Do you have someone at home? Yeah I have a boyfriend and I have a child with him. Why I feel a lack of enthusiasm? Hm, why do you ask? Just tone in your voice. Oh you don't have to peel tomato, just leave it like that. Are you worried about raising the child on your own? Hm, my son would stay with my boyfriend. I beg your pardon? It's his house so I would get a place of my own. You already planned all that? No just some thoughts but in this case it's more logical if my son stays with my boyfriend. I think it's more logical for the child to be with the mother. Why I would keep seeing him a lot because I am his mommy. Sure you are. Are you serious about that? I have to make up my mind, I'm not getting any younger. Yeah, how old are you? - 25? - No, 30. I'm 31 actually. You are very, very old. It's all downhill from here. No it's not, you'll be surprised. He's quite fit for his age. Maybe I'll be a bit like him. Have you talked lots with your father? He talks about all the things he knows, - like a tour guide. - But not about personal things. Come, we're going to dance. Yes. - Have you got any aspirin with you? - No. I will ask downstairs, right. I'll be back. Is it as bad as you thought? Hm, just like I thought. So, what direction are we going next? First we have breakfast and then we go south. - Even warmer I guess. - Yes. The more south you go, the warmer it gets. You only saw my head so far. It's no problem, just a, you really look like your mother. The extra-large version. But don't worry, I don't have the gene. I was pretty scared of that because her sister had it as well. Yes I know. So when did you find out about my mother? Well it was much later, I was in Patagonia of all places. To do what? Play music. The Danube is everything except blue. So much for that myth. Water is transparent. It doesn't have a colour. My father is a nerd. What did you say? - A nerd, that's a - No I mean the other word. Oh that. Well. Is where we going near the sea? - Please say yes. - No. - Why not? - Because they built it where it is. You want one? Actually yeah. Thank you, nice. I like this one. So you're from Italia? I don't speak Serbian. My German is also not 100% perfect. Because I grew up in Austria. But I'm still Serbian you know, I'm going to visit my grandparents in the south. Okay. We're going to Istanbul. Really? Nice. Sorry, can I join you? To Istanbul? No but I'd like to. My name is Dragan. - Lisa. - Nice to meet you. Yeah I wanted to go to an art academy in Vienna, but my paintings were big. Real big like, huge ones like real monsters. I can't help it, that's me. And you know what they said, - No. - The mother-fucking hippy said? 'you are fucking Hitler, you're fascist, you're megalomaniac' 'we don't want to see you again.' - Really? - Really, can you imagine to a 19 year old child. I mean I was very young, very young. - Yes. - And they reject me because my paintings were big. But real big, huge ones. Weird. I can show you if you want. This is wash machine and this my painting. Wow, it's huge. Huge one, told you a real huge one. Let's see the other one. You're son looks like you? Yeah a bit. But not like your boyfriend. - Also. - Is he some handsome guy? - Yes and strong. - Oh so I have to watch my steps. Where do your grandparents live, in Ni? Near. And you said you get out in Ni, do you stay in Ni? I think so, it's up to him. - We stay in Ni don't we? - Yes. - He'll play music. - Nice, can I look? It's like he's on drugs or something. He's not on drugs, he just young. Oh nice. I bought my cigarettes before rain, outside it's rain if you don't know. - Are you afraid of water? - Yeah. I saw little cats over there. - Little cats? - Yes. - Kittens? - Kittens, that's the word for little cats. - Cats. - Nice. I'd love to have cats at home but my son is allergic. I had one in Vienna. - Yeah? - Yeah, her name is telephone. Telephone. Why would you call your cat telephone? Because you're remember a guy who has a cat with the name telephone. - No. - Yeah. - No I won't. - Yes you will even if you don't want to you'll remember him. Cheers. Oh, you know how much is room here? I thought you were going to your grandparents tonight? No, they're far away a little bit you know. You said they live near here. No I said they are far away. Three and four, we are neighbours. I was better dancer when I was younger you know. When you were younger? You're a puppy. Yeah but I'm still much older than you are. Oh yeah, how old are you? Twenty eight. And how old do you think I am then? Twenty six. - Thirty one. - What? Thirty one, I'm shocked. I'm sorry, take it as a compliment. It's not because of what you said it's because of how you look. - Don't be mad at me please. - I'm not mad, it's just a cheap trick. - I don't buy it. - Okay. Come on, you're behaving like a 10 year old now. I was sincere okay? I play no games okay? I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you. Fuck you. Now undress me. No, do it yourself, I'm on holiday. Yeah, you're crazy. There is a period after sex, after orgasm, fifteen minutes. Is the only period man can think objectively. Really. Japanese even have word for that, 'Holy sexless period' - Ippon. - What? Ippon is a full point in Judo, and this, is kesa gatame. If I hold you like this for 30 seconds, I win. You can hold me for all day, I just want to have sex with you. I thought the sacred sexless period was 15 minutes? No for me it's one minute. You play irrationally, but I know you're passionate. You're more Italian than Dutch, you know that? People really have an obsession with nationalities hey. Yeah that's our hobby. Well good luck with it. Stay with me until morning please? No, I sleep in my own room. You looking for this? I'm not afraid of your judo. I want to dance. We can dance here, we can dance together. Morning. Did you sleep well? Yeah. I was drunk enough. So it's wasn't you knocking on my door last night? Excuse me? Maybe if I was sleep walking. You see the kidneys over there? - Kidneys? - Small cats? - Oh kittens. - Kittens, fuck. Yeah I saw them, really cute. Yeah nice one. Nice ones, nice twice, threes. I was thinking and I come up with something. - Wow. - Yeah. A... Maybe you can come with me to my grandparents? - Grandparents? - Yeah, for one day. - But I go to Bulgaria. - Yeah well I can get you back here early so you can go tomorrow. - And sleep there you mean? - Yeah. I want to wake up next to you. It's more intimate than sex. Yes it is. Come on, it's near. Really? Yesterday you told me it was far. Yeah. It's because they move the village overnight. Old people and cows and houses, they move them. Sorry for yesterday. I told you, fuck you. No swearing. But I'm not sorry for panties. I put them on the bar. Well maybe in Serbia they think that is funny? No, nobody in Serbia think that is funny. Only me. So? Dragan asked me to join him to his grandparents. Just for a day. A day? Our train leaves in one hour. Yes but we can take the train tomorrow. Or does it seriously fuck up the way you planned things? No of course not. It would just make a mess of all the schedule but, yes I understand that but how dramatic is that? You don't know the guy. I know what this place is called and I know the name of the hotel. This is a week for the two of us. You can fly back here from Istanbul, you can marry him, you can move in with him. - But this is... - This is what? This is a no go. A no go? Is that what you said, a no go? You can't do that to me. You are the last person to say that I can't do this to you! You don't call for 28 years, you don't respond to my emails, then you ask me to come out to Venice and drag me to God knows where, and now I want something and you tell me it's a no go. So we will be one day less in Istanbul, so deal with it. I didn't want to go there in the first place, it was your idea. Have a nice day, enjoy it. Fucker! He has five children. - Five? - Five of them yeah. So how far is it exactly to your grandparents? It's not that far, don't worry. Are we in a hurry? - No. - Can I make a special request? Why he call you now, why he didn't call you before 10 years or five years? You didn't ask? No. Well I sent him emails, when I had a child because I wanted to more about him then. I sent quite a few but he never reacted. If I had known I'd, would not has asked you to come with me. Well you didn't know, so. But still. You're breasts are ridiculous. My breasts are ridiculous? - Yeah. - You're ears are ridiculous. Fuck! I didn't mean, never mind. Why is there always that that misunderstanding when I want to make a compliment. It's a sick joke like God play mind fuck with other guys in the world. Like you can confuse full armies with them. They should name street after them. Okay, I didn't convince you. They're mine, I take my loss. So you still want to come with me to my grandparents? You're sweet. Yeah, that's what my name means. - Sweet? - Yeah, Dragan means sweet. Are you proud of your breasts? I have no particular relationship with them. Just glad they're still there. Would your grandparents mind if we sleep in the same room? No, my grandfather would be proud. - Want one? - Yeah thank you. Nice. - Hi. - Dobre. - Ni. - Ni? - I'm from Italia. - Italia! I'm here for Judo tournament. Once I met Olympic judo champion. In Austria yeah. Ah the name, Walter. Walter? I don't know his last name. Maybe you can. Now you are just one handshake away from an Olympic champion. Probably you never heard about ErdsBacon index It's a formula with which you can calculate how far away you are from these two peoples. Paul Erds is Hungarian mathematics and Kevin Bacon is a famous American actor. So the number of steps you are far away from these two people, telling you how important you are in arts, science you know - Natalie Portman? - Black Swan. You know she has the best index. - Really? - Yes because she's a psychologist. We're all scientific people with the people who know scientific papers with the people who wrote scientific paper - with? - The Hungarian mathematician. Great, clever girl. Have you always been a trucker? In Macedonia I was a journalist. For a local newspaper. But then this crisis started and I lost my job. Give me address of hotel. I will take you there. Is my father in his room? Mauro? No he went this morning to the train station. To Italy? To Italy? No to Istanbul, first to Bulgaria. You didn't go? No we were supposed to go tomorrow. He didn't book a room for tonight. Yes? - I'm back. - Really? And I'm an asshole. Yes. May I sleep here or should I take another room? Take another room. Right. No, sleep here. Look, it's no problem there are plenty of rooms. Maybe I shouldn't have done that with that boy. Well when you're having sex you're not alone. Yeah. At times I think sex is the only thing that keeps Mike and me together. Really? That and our son of course. And sometimes I find him real sweet and buys something like this rubber duck I bought it in Venice. Sex can be so powerful. Sure. I guess for men it's even worse. Why should it be worse for men? Well for men for instance, there is this theory, that they can only think straight the first 15 minutes after orgasm. The Japanese even have a word for it, Yes that's Kenjataimu. Something like that. Kenja is wisdom. Taimu is from time in English. Kenjataimu is wisdom time. Are there things that you don't know? Well I hardly know anything about women. Yeah right. Somehow I don't believe that. I guess you don't know what the something Bacon index is? - Kurdish bacon yes. - Stop, you're horrible. And what if I had left my luggage in Venice because I thought we'd be back in one day? Would you have told me we go to Istanbul? Probably yes, come. Become nothing. Right. Become nothing. You understand that? Sort of. But did you like it? - Yes. - Right. But what is it? It is a poem, by Rumi. Mevlânâ Rumi. My favourite one. I always take him with me when I'm travelling. Is your child that big? No that's more like a five year old. Dylan is more like this. But he's a bit tall for his age. Do you have a picture of him? Yeah. I had imagined it would be the first thing you would ask me when we met in Venice. Yes of course, hundreds of them on my phone. Do you have a picture of me as a child? Yes. But not on my phone. At home. Where was it taken? On the beach. The eyes, they are my eyes and my mother's eyes. It's incredible how things can be past on over more than one generation. He's got her eyes. Did you take a look at the menu? No. So why didn't you answer my emails? It was too difficult. - You know since I left Holland. - But why did you leave Holland? Probably because I didn't want to fight over you. Yeah. No court cases, who gets to see you, how often, once a week, once in two weeks. I wanted to make things clear for you. So it was because of me - more or less? - No. Not only that. The only reason I was still in Holland, was your mother. It would have been unbearable to see your mother and you with someone else. Sorry. No it's okay. Your mother was the love of my life, I hope you understand that. Yes, I do understand that. Maybe. Although I've never felt that way about anyone. But I feel sorry for that. No well. We are three quarters, more than three quarters of our trip. One more night on the train and we're in Istanbul. Byzantium, Constantinople. Travelling is not the worst thing. There was a wise man in China, Lou Tsi, who said 'wise man doesn't travel.' It was ironic because he spent his entire life travelling on the back of an ox throughout the whole country. And why did you want to make this trip with me? I mean, why now? Why not? Just because you wanted to. Yes. And what are you going to do when you get back? Do you have any specific plans? Are you going to be near Holland soon? Any plans for the future? I don't know, I don't know. All that matters is now. Come on. We are in Bulgaria, let's concentrate on that. Right? Here and now. And tomorrow, is just tomorrow. Anton? Mauro, Mauro. Imagine that that is your job. Oh well, I did everything except a airline pilot and brain surgeon. I haven't been always able to live off my music. - Also bell boy and rickshaw driver? But most of the time I've just been selling my body. Wow! This is like a proper city. It's more like a country, there are more people living here than at home. Agatha Christie was actually here. And here is where we will sleep. - Woah! - Yes. You know, I already had a hunch. So why did you say no? Good evening Sir, - welcome to Pera Palace, how are you? - Thank you. - Checking in? - Yes, two rooms. Hey, for your boyfriend. Hey, nice one. Cool. Whoa! That ship is huge. - Did you work on one like that? - Yes, actually here is where I got on the boat when your mother flew back to her parents. In those times we didn't have mobile telephones. And we were not allowed to to make any private calls from the boat. So I had to wait until we arrived in Mykonos was the first harbour. I get this guy on the telephone speaking Spanish and he put me through to her room. I was so scared. I was so afraid that she's just changed her mind about me. About us. So I had been waiting and waiting and waiting and then, she picked up the telephone. And she was so glad to hear my voice. Well not as glad as I was. Ah, and you were already in her belly. There's something I wanted to tell you, maybe we can go have a seat. There is a a terrace the other side of the bridge. Okay. - Yeah, let's go. - No. You can tell me here. Right. I'm going to die soon. I expected that. I already thought so when you didn't want to answer about your future plans. I just got a little hope when you bought an instrument in Milberia. I thought why would he buy an instrument if he's going to die soon or something. Well I ordered it a long time ago. And besides, I'm not going to die tomorrow. Or in two weeks. Do you mind if I walk alone a bit? No. Take your time. Great music. Thank you. How are you? And you? Hey Mike, it's me. I was wondering how you guys are doing? And I'll be back tomorrow. But you probably have your headphones on I guess. So I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Kiss. Hello? Yes. So, so. Off and on. Thought you were still in your room. That should be the rule of every musician. I can't imagine people who don't love music. I can imagine people who don't like silence. You're always talking so. My daughter. You know, I'm not a religious man, but that doesn't mean I'm not spiritual. Come on. I... Don't know, what I believe. My parents are religious but they never forced me. The problem is this one, the parents should teach children how to think and not what to think. So you're leaving to Holland today? Yeah. We had the plan to fly back from Venice and then we changed the plan and now she's flying from Istanbul. Always with him. The flight leaves at five o'clock right. - I'm going to call a taxi for you later on. - Okay. My flight leaves at a eight thirty. Oh so that means you can come to Sultinamed with us this afternoon? - You're going to Saltinamed? - Yes. - With Amre. - Yes to see Orzan and his wife. - Really? - He's there too. God I haven't seen them in ten years. Excuse me. Tell me? I can't handle this, are you crazy? What's the problem? You were just going to put me in a taxi and have fun this afternoon? - No! - What's the whole point of me being here? Do you have any idea what I'm going through? - This is our last day. - I know! That's why I wanted to go with you to Dervish dance, that's why I wanted to have lunch with you. But it's the whole thing, I don't know who you are. I didn't know who my father was, what he's like, and now he dies. You have no right to do that. It was your thing. Come on Lisa, please? Lisa please don't go.
