There's nothing to it. Nothing to it, Ml. O'Brien. The only gold in this jail is what l got here in my wisdom tooth. That's all l wanna hear. But look, boss. I'm having trouble with the boys. Some of them got a silly notion they'd like to live a little bit longer. Well. we've not licked yet. Maybe O'Brien just saved us a lot of trouble by hauling that ore into town. Whafre you getting at?
