How is malaria of your dad? - Better. Good. Why not sit down, boy? You are reading our Book of Samuel? Yes, I am. - You like to study Hebrew? - Not really. I'm trying to learn. It makes sense to stay so much time here... without learning the local language. - You study Samuel? - I have to study in school. - And? - I prefer comic books. Undoubtedly. I have a question for you. - In Samuel II... - Why so much like to read Samuel? - It is so boring. - Boring? Boy, this is the beginning of the monarchy. If you understand the words, will understand the concepts. For example, see: Chapter 3, verse 1. "Extend to a long... the war between the house of Saul and of David. But as the power David went up from fortified... the house of Saul would be increasingly weakening. " Yeah, so? What is the word to 'undermine'? - This, daleem. - Daleem, it. According to my trusty dictionary, daleem can be... - Poor. - Exactly. So being poor means also to be weak? Yes, according to their language. I don't like it. We are a bit poor, but we are not weak. Yes, I can see that. - You are Israeli? - Yes. Actually, my mother said I am shocked in Poland... but I just left the egg here. She loves to references chickens. Really? Then you are Polish? No, just my parents. You British- born? - Sure. Well, I loved the visit, but gotta go now. - I have a report to do. - Really? What kind of report? It is a secret business. You come visit me again?

The boat will get at 4 in the morning. We find them and hide them here. Got blankets and pillows. - Thanks. I am not very confident. We plan this for days. Just going to sleep a few hours. Sleep thinking about it... no one else will kill or humiliate the Jews. Come on, boy. It's your turn. Put your hand here. Open your fingers. And hold on it. A little down. So. Keep strong. You can go. Very good! - Who is that? - A friend. Do not have bombs hidden? Hardly. Come on. You see a green ball? Try to hit it. Just. Nice try.

What are you talking about? Almost every day, he will goes to the Oriental Palace... talk a British soldier. It is one o'clock there and then comes home. We followed you, many times. - Is this true? - Is not what it seems. Your child should be interrogated. I am his father, I'll take care of it. You should have spoken before with me. - So, no, children. - Stop it. Stop! This is unbelievable. Your child put us in danger? No, I don't think so. But it'd better if you sleep somewhere else. She is right. The house is probably been watched. I warn the others. We will not sleep here, for now. We are very sorry. - Is anybody there? - No. It seems to be quite. Certainly the home monitor.

I do not know. If you did more attention to him... - I understand that this is my fault. - I never said that. - You said if I playing more... - I am not talking about play... - I'm talking about listening to him. - Okay, if I had heard more... he would not be fascinated by a British soldier. This is what you saying? No. - What, boy? - They followed me. Discovered that I visit you. - Who? - Ben Hur and Chita. And my friends don't talk to me anymore. And my parents are ashamed of me. They call me a traitor and I'm going to be interrogated. - I go to talk to them. - No, it will not make things better. - But I want to help you. - I can handle it myself. If I talk to your friends and family... But it will be good for you. For your situation with your army. Proffy, you really are... I wish Priscilla meet you. - And your mother in Manchester. - Yes. - Maybe one day. - Maybe. Maybe one day there will be Mandate a Jew in Britain. I think I will not able to... for a while. Of course. You better stay away. That will be best. Shalom, Sergeant Dunlop. The price today is very good. Here is. Come to our attention... that you have a relationship with a... Sergeant Stephen Dunlop. You visited him in Oriental Palace... at least 12 times. Is that correct? Yes. What is the nature of your relationship with this man? - We are friends. - Friends? I see. - You have friends your own age? - I used to. How did you meet this Sergeant Dunlop? I was out after curfew... and he got me. And was going to arrest me. - And did he arrested you? - No. Why was that? Maybe he find I was too young. They arrested many boys of your age. Some of them were beaten. Do you offer something... or said something that made he decides not arrest you? I told him, I wasn't afraid if he arrested me. And how did he respond? He said he let me go this time, but the next time if I be out of the curfew, he have to arrest me. So, why did you start to visit him? It was very interesting to talk with him. - What would you talk about? - I do not know. Things. Girls. He likes to talk about Hebrew language. And the Bible. His father was a minister. He asked if you knew any underground activities? No. He asked if you knew anybody in the underground? Never. Did you had any political discussions with him? You mean like Ben Gurion or something? - Yes. - I do not remember. Look, he knows that I hate the British. I hate the occupation. So you did had a political discussion with him? Yes, but no. Sergeant Dunlop asked the name of your friends? - No. Do not want to know about your friends? He wanted to know about my friends and my family... never asked their names. If you're hiding any information from us... you can be put in the prison, regardless of your age. All right. After the transcript... we will decide if and when any punishment... of Proffy Leibowitz and his family. You will be under watch by next month... and will be forbiden from having any contact with this British soldier. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. That closed our session. You is a terrible traitor. The worst traitor is that that approaches the enemy. I do believe that you were telling the truth. But after what I have seen... I trust no human being. On Montag, you have friends... on Freitag, they become our enemies. The only one you can trust are the chickens. Frank! Hi old man. You are going home! Are now almost 4 years. I am counting the minutes out of this hell. I think you will miss it. I want to be in a country where they are pleased to see me. Listen, you know that kid coming visit me? Coming over time? Say that I sent home and not to talk to him... before leaving. Tell him I wish a brilliant life. - You can do this? - Of course, Stephen. Sure. - See you in Thistle Square. - Bye. Stay away from Proffy. Do not worry. You will have fun at school I promise. So stay calm. Do not worry and be well, right? It will be okay. Stay away from Proffy, understand? Do not approach him. You will love it, I promise. Good morning, students... welcome the new school year. Good morning, teacher Gihon. We have a new student this year... Rachel Hochberg, she does not speak Hebrew. We have a new student, Rachel Hochberg... which came to us from Cyprus. Bruchim Habaaim. Hope you have enjoyed the holidays. We all know the evil occurred in the last week... Quiet, quiet. Freeze. Silence be quiet. Freeze. Freeze. - You saw the Sergeant Dunlop? - No, sorry. - You saw the Sergeant Dunlop? - No. You saw the Sergeant Dunlop? - No, not seen. - Me neither. You know where the Sergeant Dunlop is? I do not know. They took him to the barricades. Pass me the ashtray, please. Thank you. Division 23, 6h training. - You do not have permission. - I want to see the Sergeant Dunlop. I do not know who he is... and you are not allowed to enter, understand? I just want to say goodbye before he return to England. Listen, boy, I am not speaking in code... you can not enter. Where the soldiers going? Are going to Haifa, go back home. Sergeant Dunlop! Sergeant Dunlop! Sergeant Dunlop! Sergeant Dunlop! Sergeant Dunlop! - Proffy? Is everything all right? - I am tired, Ima. - Come, I make you some pudding. - I do not want pudding. We have made decision about your son. Thank you. At school asked to stay vigilant and ask them the same. We must always know where he is. Yes, of course. The boy must not be envolved in any controversy... Nothing. Whatever individual politics may be. The boy is just a boy. Chita, wait... will never talk to me? Hey, sorry for not told them the truth. I was scared. You want a Gibi borrow? You can even get one or two. And homework? I can help you. We have good news for you, Proffy. - Yes? - They are not pressing any charges against you. I never did anything wrong. Well, that's what they decided. I wish other people think so. I think, it's better in school? Nothing is better anymore. I hate the school. Do you like I have the conversation with Mr. Gihon? My God, no. It make things worse. Besides, he hates me as much as the rest. They do not hate you, Proffy. They are making the scapegoat. Sometimes, children need someone to criticize. They hate me because of Sergeant Dunlop. But my enemy was much more friend to me that my friends. Do you think it will be possible... What? I know you will think I am crazy. Do you think there is any chance... that we go back to Poland? We fought so hard to get here. Why you want to go to Poland? I ruined this country. Do not be silly, you only 11 years old. In Poland, I could make a fresh start. In school call me the 'traitor' and they hates me. Maybe there I have the chance to be known as fine man... instead of here. A 'traitor' for the rest of my life. Proffy... no way hell to go to Poland. Eat. So Proffy... that there is sitting here so long? What problem? I like. And the friends with whom runs the city? do not know who are my friends. What is a friend, anyway? Listen this... 'Tell me who you walk with, and tell you who you are. ' But that boy. - I told him? - Not yet. Proffy, your mother and I we will travel for a few days. Why? There will be a honor service of people... who died in our town in Poland. - We must go to that. - And we also need to get away. But what about me? I never am at this family? - I also need to get away. - You must to be in school. Where is the honor service? In Tel Aviv. - Why can not I go? - It is not for you. But what about after the honor service? We can do something in Tel Aviv. Your father and I need be alone. Why do I always that left at home? It's not fair. It is cruel! We ask for a neighbor to look after you. A young woman who lives cross the way. Yardena? You know her? She works at the bakery. You are right. I can be such a selfish child. Always thinking about myself. Never thinking about my parents. Go to honor service and have a wonderful time. - Hello. - Shalom everyone. - Shalom, Yardena. - Shalom, Proffy. So, there is plenty of food in the kitchen... for the next two days, make sure you eat all of it. And Proffy? Be a good boy? Have a good time. Nisiya Tovah. Bye. Bye, Proffy. So, you are a little traitor, boy, aren't you? - I am not a traitor. - We discuss that later. Come, let's make a super dinner! - You want coffee? - Who? Me? Is anybody else at this dinner party? Sure, I'd like some. - Is it too strong? - No, it's delicious. So tell me... you passed secret to the British? Never. - They put you on trial, no? - They ask me few questions. Proffy, you know, you can tell me anything. I know how to keep a secrets. Are you in the underground? Oh yes, I pass the secret undergroung for rugalach... and hide weapons in Challah, all Shabbat. So, what was so interesting about this British man? I find most of them so boring, no passion. Sergeant Dunlop had a passion. Yes? How do you know?

You know, when I close my eyes and try to think of Sergeant Dunlop... I can see him clearly. His pink skin... his short fingernails his big eyebrows. But when close my eyes and try to think of papa... it's hard to see him. I do not know how papa's teeth... because he never smiles. So, where is your British soldier now? He went back to Britain. Yes, they all are to leave soon. I just hope we don't regret... when we are without them. The British must go. It would be It would be disappearing. I mean, I was... but the rest of them we have to drive out. We will... but not tonight. Look at the time. It's almost almost 11. And tell me, are you sound sleeper? Yes.
