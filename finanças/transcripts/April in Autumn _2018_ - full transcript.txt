- Are you from Toronto? - Yeah. Thank you. Hi! - Oh, my... - Oh, my God, hi! - Oh, my God, look at you. - Hey, you. Mom. Hey. I missed you. Aw. Oh, stop. - Mm, Mom. - Okay. - Looks good. - Yeah. You look great, Mom. Thank you. - So do you. - Oh, thanks. Well, you know, I'm far from my twilight years, right? You know, Mom's been actually auditioning for theater stuff again. - Oh, really? That's awesome. - Mm-hm. Well, you know, theater's addictive. It's like a drug. - Thank you. - Once it gets into your veins, - you just have to keep doing it. - Can't get enough. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Can you pass me a piece of bread? - Oh, yeah. So, we, uh, we followed you on Instagram. You went to so many places. What was your favorite? Oh, that's hard to say. I, um, I really liked India, actually... well. Yeah, all, yeah, Cambodia was great, Thailand. I actually was teaching yoga in between writing. And I got to teach right outside the ruins in Thailand. - Wow. - Yeah. - It's pretty crazy. - Wow. So, were you able to make a living off of teaching yoga there? Yeah, mostly. Wha... what's mostly? I don't know, just some other jobs too. Well, like what? What about your writing, your play? Nothing, I'm just kind of... just stuck, you know. It's been two years and I can't... figure it out. You know what your father used to do when he was stuck writing? - What? - He would listen to really loud heavy metal music. - What? - Yeah. Don't do the same thing, okay, because... I, I, I forgot to put napkins on the table. Mom seems good. Yeah, she is, I mean, most of the time. You know, it's just every once in a while... Because in your messages just you made it sound like there was a problem. Well, some days. It's, uh, Mom's birthday coming up soon. Mm, we should do something for her like a plan, go for dinner. Well, I don't know about that. I mean, I'm a student and everything, right, so. We'll make a reservation. Uh, we're kind of short on money... is what I'm saying. So, I was thinking that we could do something at home. - Yeah. - You know, have a little - party or. - Let's do that. Yeah, we'll have like a nice dinner here. - Yeah. - Okay, cool. Thanks, Mom. - I can't believe you're here. - I know, yeah. Yeah, me neither. Remember this day? You stuck your foot in the spokes. Yeah. Gosh, Mom and Dad were like local celebrities, weren't they? The writer and the actress. Envy of the town. Yeah. Do you think she misses him? Mm-hm. This was the last photo taken of him. Look how young we are. We're just kids. Oh, stop it, silly! So, tell me, so, tell me about your travels. Like, like, what was, what was the most, I don't know, exciting or like crazy thing that happened? - Well, I met a boy. - Really? Okay. - His name was Oscar. - Yeah. He was from South America. - Okay, cool. - Yeah. And, um, I don't know. We just traveled around together and did everything together. It was super disorganized, but he was kind of cute. - Yeah. - Cool. So, I don't know. Maybe I'll go there or maybe he'll come here, but we'll figure it out. Wow. Don't worry. I'm not leaving anytime soon. Cut it out. I just want to give the soil one last hand before winter arrives. You know, I always do this, keep it aerated. Until the snow comes, then the moisture can seep in and freeze. So nice to have you home, sweetheart. I love being outside. My little plot of land in the city. I don't know what I would have done if I... couldn't step out here every year and... plant something and help it grow and... water the vegetables and... watch them rise and rise. What do you think you'll do now that you're here? I don't know. Help you and Sara. Go and find a job. Get my life back together. Maybe you and Sara could write new music together. Mom, you all right? - I'm going to get us some water, would you like some? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, I'll finish it. - Yeah, this is not real work. That's garden until over there. Okay. Yeah. This plant's going to thrive next year, Mom. Wow, that was fast. You see, two daughters are further than one. - Yeah. - Here's some water. Actually, we should get going. I told Sara we'd meet at the farmer's market after her class. Okay, thanks. - It looks really yummy. - It looks so good. - Hey, guys. - Hi. - This looks delicious. - Yeah. Well, Mom knows everybody here. Well, Sara and I come here every week. We should think about seeing if one of the bakers wants to take your biscotti. - Everybody loves it. - That's a great idea. - Really? - Yeah. Don't you think people might find it weird, an Aussie of Italian descent selling biscotti in Canada? - I don't know, it's multicultural. - Yeah. I don't know, it'll be good, yeah. People will love it. And are you going to help with production or are you just going to get rich from me? - Yeah, filthy rich. - We're going to eat them. Yeah. We'll be the Bill Gates of, uh, biscotti. We could call it bisc-Aussies. Oh, my God, that's, uh, horrible. - I'm going to go rest for a while. - Okay. Just get me up later, so I, I'll help with dinner. All right. Hey. I want to show you something. Okay. - Open it. - What's this? Where'd you find this? I literally dug it up in the garden. - Wow. - Isn't it crazy? These are beautiful. - When did you find this? - Just this morning. - They are love letters. - I know. Wow. There's no signatures or anything, but there's... there's initials. Do you think they are to Mom? Uh, this house has been here a long time so could've been anyone's. It was buried in our backyard. Could totally be Mom's. Oh, I don't know, they don't look like... - they are hers and if they were hers, you know... - Why... ...then if she buried them, she buried them for a reason, right? So. Obviously she wants to, uh, leave them underground. I feel like someone made these for her. They are beautiful. Well, if she forgot about them, and then she buried them for a reason, and if we dig them up and show them to her, then that could be really upsetting for her. Well, not unless she wanted to remember. Yeah, but what if these were written when Dad was alive? Yeah, and what if they weren't? I don't really think it's a good idea. It's this beautiful mystery of the past that doesn't have to be explained. Hey, sorry I'm late. It's okay, I'm used to it. You're always late. Yeah, bad habit, I know. Mm, thank you. Yeah. I love the fall, the autumn when it changes like this, it's... - it's so beautiful. - Me too. - How are your studies? - Good, really good. You remember what I'm focusing on, right? Early 20th century French Impressionism, so Erik Satie, Debussy, Forain. Especially Erik Satie. - Mm, major, yeah. - He's incredible. You know, sometimes I wish I was living in that time. You know, Paris early 20th century when all of that beautiful music was coming out for the first time, you know? It was so exciting, so fresh. Hm. So, what's wrong? - Oscar proposed to me. - What? By email. - Email? - Yeah, email. - Email's... - Yeah, lousy. Well, what are you going to say? - I don't know. - Well, are you happy? Ugh, I don't... yes, I don't know, I don't know, I'm... You know, things always work out for you. I'm so jealous. That is not true. I haven't even said yes yet. Yeah, but you're going to and then you're going to be married, and you're going to be happily ever after. No, it's marriage. Are you kidding? Love is like a sickness, it's... People just use you. People are selfish. You can't just put yourself fully into it. I disagree. You have to put all of yourself into it, every ounce of your soul, otherwise it's meaningless. - No, but I mean... - Love is passion, like. - No. - You have to have passion otherwise what are you doing? No, because, Sara, then it just burns you, you know? Love just burns you, that's what happens. - It's actually interesting stuff to... - April. - Hi. - Oh, Mark! - Hi. - Oh, my gosh, hi! Well, it's been. - What, like five? - Oh, my God. - Oh, uh, yeah, eight years. - Eight years? - Eight years. - Eight, yeah. Wow, so that means you have the adult braces off. Oh. Uh, yeah. They are... Sorry, this is my sister, Sara. - I don't think you have met her. - Hey, Sara, hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. Yeah. So, I mean, look, what, what have you been doing lately? - Uh, teaching actually. - Yoga? I see you on Facebook sometimes. You were in India traveling. Yeah, I was there for two years and... I decided I needed to come back. I got homesick. - Uh, you, what are you doing? - Oh, God. Well, I, I quit my job and, uh... - Wow. - ...yeah, I, uh... I realized working in television was soul-sucking, so I went back to school and started painting and studying part time and now I'm exhibiting at galleries. - And, uh, yeah. - Wow, that's awesome. I have a studio right near the park here. - You, you should come by and visit. - Yeah. Yeah? Look, I, I have to run, but, um, here's my card, my number's on it. - Okay, thanks. - Call me and, uh, we'll, um, if you want we'll have coffee and just catch up. - You know. - Yeah, yeah, I would love that, yeah. - Okay, all right. Nice to meet you, okay. - Nice to meet you, yeah. - Take care. - Bye. - See you. - Bye. Oh, my God. So, who was that? Mark. Yeah, but who's Mark? He was my first real adult love. First person who told me he loved me. So, what happened? After he told me, he sold his house and moved to LA. Wow. You really loved him. Yeah. Yeah, I really did. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. Uh, good, thank you. - Um, I'm April. - Yeah. How you doing? Yeah, I served for years, and then I used to work at a cafe as well. You wouldn't have a cigarette, would you? - I'm sorry. - No? You want this coffee. Oh, thank you, sure. Do you mind if I sit? No, no. Sure, be my guest. Sure is getting colder, huh. Well, yeah, you don't have to tell me. Ugh. But I have my own place, I'm tough. I'd be here no matter what the weather was like. I like benches. I like watching. I wrote a, a book of poems, unpublished of course, called Life from the Bench. Not life on a bench, but I wouldn't imply that I spent my entire life on a bench, but Life from the Bench. You can see so many things. I like to, you know, observe more than participate. I guess my life would have been different if I participated more. You see that guy over there? - Yes. - I can tell you when he'd... go get his coffee. Twenty seven minutes from now. Twenty seven minutes from now he'll walk down there. He'll get, get a large coffee, and then I'll see him walk back. I guess we're all creatures of habit. Change is hard, change is a lot of work. You don't mind me just... - blathering on like this. - No. I don't often just talk to people. Don't you have any you know, friends or family or...? Family, uh, no. It would have been nice to have a family. I think I'd like to have a daughter. I heard this guy talking about daughters turn into their mothers, but to him it was a negative. Probably talking about his ex-wives. Uh, but a daughter would be nice or even a son. But I think I daughter. - You remind me of someone. - Oh, really? Yeah, Erik Satie. I like the name. Was he handsome? Yeah, very handsome, and a gentleman. He was a very private person, but he seemed... very sensitive and aware. I'm studying him. I'm wr... I'm writing my master's thesis on him actually. And I, and I compose so I guess in a way he's kind of my muse. He, he's the grandfather of contemporary music, so. You know, he was going against what had been established in music at that time and in society. He was a part of the avant-garde group - of artists in Paris. - Avant-garde? Mm-hm. And, uh... I don't know, he wrote these little ditties called "Les Gymnopédies," which he would play in this cafe on the Champs de Mars for variety shows. And no one really knew about them or cared until much later in his life, you know and... I don't know, he seemed to live - many different lives in a way. - Wow. - That's very interesting. - Yeah. At, at one point he had this stage where he would wear 12 identical velvet suits. - That's a little bizarre. - Yeah. And, and he had this mad, you know, passionate love affair with this woman named, uh, this female painter, Suzanne Valadon, who, you know, after six months, just cut if off, left all of the sudden, and he was heartbroken. And he never loved again. And, you know, he was drinking or had things on and off and lived in smaller and smaller apartments. And eventually when he died they found hundreds of compositions stuffed in pillows and floorboards, and in these two pianos that he had one stacked on top of the other. All these works that he had never completed. Wow. You're kind of a romantic. - I guess, yeah, in a way. - But what would you... If he were here, what would you say to him? What would you say to Erik? I... I guess I would tell him... you know, that I'm proud of him... for living, you know, his authenticity, his real self. - Wow. - That he lived a... He lived a beautiful life despite life, and that, you know, his works touched many people. He, he survived after all these years. I'm honored that you would think of me in regard to him. You seem to have his properness. Proper. I'm hardly proper. But he would say the exact same thing. Here. I'd like if you would take this, I. - Oh, no, I can't. - No, please. I really don't need it. - If it pleases you. - Yes, it would. What's your name, sir? Erik will do. Nice to meet you, Erik. Can I sit here? Yeah, obviously. So, do you, do you come here often? Oh, no, I come here to escape my place when I'm, you know, working there all day and, you know, uh, you know, just to get away. You are just escaping someone at home? No. No, no, I'm alone. I'm, I'm separated. Oh, I'm sorry. I was married for a few years, short time. And I have a daughter. She's great, she's great, but it's hard, you know. And, well, you don't want to hear this, you know, so. Yeah. So, you were traveling for a while. Yeah, I was teaching in India actually and traveling, trying to find myself or... more of myself. - And you did, did you? - I, I, to be honest, I don't know, like, after being away I feel like I know less actually than before. Then I just, I got tired and my Mom was... not doing so well, so it was time to come home. You know what? I wasn't going to say anything, but I was, I was going to call you the other day because I... I found this box, which is so weird, in my backyard, and it's filled with these paintings and these love letters to my mother. - Wow, from your dad? - No, no, no, that's the thing is that it's not from my Dad. It's like, I want to find this artist. - Really? - So I want to find who it is. - Really, why? - I think he made them for her, and then they are... Is, is there a signature on the artwork? No, there's no name anywhere. Anyways I thought just because you said like that you were in the art world that maybe... Yeah, yeah, I could. I mean, I could show it to some galleries that I know. - Really? Yes, that would be amazing. - Yeah, yeah. All right, - why not, right? - Yeah, why not? - Why not? Why not? - Why not, right? Okay, fine, fine, okay. - Ah, ha, ha. - Yeah. Robot. My spot. One, two, five, six, seven, 14. Wow. Mom. I was just thinking about... people in my life who are gone. And I... sometimes forget who's still around and it's like... more and more people are dying who never died before. Yeah, I know that sounds funny, but it's true. You know, and I, sometimes I forget what you're father looked like. Like I have to... picture his face in my mind and... I try to remember little things that he'd do like the way he'd pat his hair down after he'd take his hat off, and the way he'd open the mail from the side. You know, always at the side. And... the way he'd laugh. He didn't laugh a lot, but when he did it was contagious. Yeah, and then other people. Like who, Mom? Oh, just... people. Oh, come on, you can tell us about that. April. What's wrong with her? Oh, she's just mad she's losing. - Oh, ho, ho. - Double word. Very good. Better than the last one. Hi. Bye, Mom. Hi, honey, was your mom waiting very long? Kind of. Mom says to have me ready by five on Sunday. Okay, all right. You ready for a weekend of painting? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay, come on, let's go. Your dolphin, he's jumped right out of the ocean. - Yeah. - Fabulous. That's a real fat black cat. Mm-hm. What do you want to do this weekend sweetheart? Just this, this is fine. Really? And how was school? It was good. What'd you do? I scored the most goals in our basketball game. You did? - Yeah. - The most goals? - Mm-hm. - I want to come see a game. When's your next game? It might be uncomfortable. Why? Mom goes to them. Okay. You know, sweetheart, there will be a time when your Mom and I will be talking again, and we'll be able to sit together and watch a game. Like sitting right beside each other? Yeah, yeah. I mean, we'll be sitting beside each other, but we won't be together if that's what you mean. Sometimes, uh... people just, uh, they just can't get going, sweetheart. You know. And they, they just, they stop getting along. I know this is hard and... I would, uh, say magic words to you to make everything better. I would move the whole Earth. I love your dolphin. Thanks. It's a very good one. - Mom. - Yeah. I've forgotten how to work it. Oh.

April. Do you like this work? It's from one of our members. It's a post-post-premillennial anti-apocalyptic look at the conundrum of modern portrait in today's society. Selfies have overtaken the world. What he's trying to say is that today's selfie-obsessed culture is full of shit. Sorry about that. I spend too long by myself in here. Anyway, how can I help you? Oh, uh, I was wondering if you could identify... this artist. Is he local? I, yeah, I think he is. There's no signature. We've been up and down in galleries on Queen Street. Nobody can identify him. May I? This does remind me of one artist. Really? Yeah, part of a group. - Do you know his name? - No, no, you would have to give me time to look around and ask. Leave me the work. The? Thank you. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - Sorry, what's going on? - Sara, you won't believe what happened, I found that artist. I found, I found a lead on the artist, and this guy's going to help us find him. - He knows him. - What? Or he knows of him. He can help us. Yeah, with, with Mom, with the box, - the box in the back... - April, I told you not... ...with all the paintings? I told you to leave it alone. I, I know, but did, but did you think we'd actually find him? This is great. - This is not great. - It's really great. It is, it's so good. This is a waste of time and it's rude. - It's disrespectful. - No, it's not. - It's something good for Mom. - Yes, it is. Mom, doesn't want it? She buried the box for a reason. She doesn't want to remember this person, this part of her life. It's done. I mean, you always do stuff like this. You know, you think that you're helping, and you just get in the way. You're meddling and you, you try to romanticize this kind of ideal end scenario, but it's not like that. You have to take a look at other things that are happening right now in your life, okay? Have, have you even thought about Oscar at all? This has nothing to do with Oscar. It has everything to do with Oscar. Listen, do whatever you want, I just, I don't want to be a part of it, okay? I just don't think it's a good idea. Erik. - Sara, hi. - Just the man I came to see. - Really? - Yeah. You mind sitting with me? Mi casa es su casa. That's right. So, what's the matter? It's just, uh, family, I guess. Family. My sister, you know, she came back just two weeks ago, and she's already driving me crazy. I mean, I haven't seen her in like two years but, and I love her. You know, just how can we be exactly the same yet so different? Anyway. How are you? Tell me about you, your life. - Me? - Yeah, your life story. Like who is Erik? Uh, well, I'm just a man, just a guy. I don't know, I drove a truck for a while and I, uh... kept orchids and... worked in a factory. I was a cowboy for a while? - Cowboy? - Yeah, yeah. I rode horses and, um, I broke horses too except they broke me back so. I kept moving around. But eventually I had to come home. Came back to Toronto but there wasn't really much for me. I've got jobs but... they didn't last long. They always had the same thing. They said, "You don't fit in." And so, it killed me but I had to go online one day and get welfare and it hurt. You have had joy too I hope. Yeah, I had a joy. Sometimes too much for my own good. And love, don't get me started. Why, what about love? Well, I don't have the heart for it anymore, literally. Love can be hard on your heart. You, a boyfriend? No. I don't know, I... I get myself into these situations where... I guess I like distance. I mean, I... I really want passion but... at this point I guess I'd just rather talk about it than be in it. It's more fun when you participate. You would have made a really good father to a daughter. I think I would have. I really wanted you to listen to this. It's Erik Satie. - Hey. - Oh, hi, Damien. - Are you joining us this afternoon? - Thanks. - Uh, this is Sara. - Oh. - She's a friend of mine. - Hi, Sara, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Um... I go to a, uh, therapy group on Wednesdays. Damien runs it. He's my, uh, doctor. Yeah. Um... Sara likes benches too. Don't we all. Uh, you live local? Uh, yeah, just a few blocks away. Just never really seen you around, that's all. Yeah, I guess I keep my head low. Of course. Coming? Yeah, uh. My mind just gets too many things. And I don't have an off switch. Thanks very much for the music. It was lovely. Thank you, Erik. Enjoy your day. Nice meeting you. Nice to meet you too, pleasure. Okay. Erik? She likes to call me that. All right. Hey. You really think these biscotti are good enough to sell? Yeah, Mom, absolutely. People love your baking. You really missed a lot. Fresh baking all the time. Fresh vegetables from the garden. It's been great. Well, Mom, it's like you have been practicing for this moment for 30 years, right? Yeah, well, there's no reason why I couldn't have a big, baking empire. Who knows? The point is, you have to think big. Yeah, you do. Shoot for the cannelloni. Swing the big biscotti. Broaden the tiramisu. Go panettone or go home. Yeah. Touch your nose. Let's have some wine to celebrate. - Very good. - Yeah, sure. Ooh. Alright, what are we celebrating? Well, your music, April's writing... ...and the fact that I have two of the most beautiful creative daughters in the world, who obviously take after me. Sara's not that talented. Neither is April. Okay, I have two of the most interesting daughters in the world. How many more do you know? Mm, just you two and that's enough. Cheers! Mm. I was just thinking about home. Home. Yeah, you know, childhood. Like you, April, I left home, left my family behind. Met your father, who traveled with a Canadian touring company. Shakespeare. Yeah, we know this one. "Romeo, oh, Romeo. Where for art thou, Romeo?" I was an amazing Juliet. - Yeah. - I was. If I hadn't have left I wouldn't have met your father. Bad boy of Canadian literature. I mean, I had met some bad boys before, but no Canadians. And certainly not... none that could write like he could. I have regrets. Leaving my mother, we were close. You know, I see myself in you, April. The adventurer. It's like, and you, Sara, I see the person I should have been, staying and taking care of people. Why do you regret leaving your mother? I don't regret leaving her... because I wouldn't have had you two. Yeah, I mean, you two. I, I wouldn't trade this life for anything. No matter what's happening to me. Mom. Nothing's going to happen to you. We're going to take care of you. Both of us. Sorry, sorry. You know what? We're going to have the best biscotti at that farmer's market, and we're going to make a lot of money and be able to live in Greece or Italy and have men catering to us, hand and foot. Men. Well, I'm not that old. You'd be amazed how many men, you know, still look at me. Oh, yeah? Do tell, come on. Are you withholding from us? Maybe someday I'll tell you. Come on, you can tell us. - The biscotti are ready. - No, they are not. - You're such a liar. - Yes, they are. No, I heard the alarm. Oh, yeah, saved by the bell. I don't hear it. Hi. - Hi. - April. I have good news for you. - Good news, good news? - Yeah, I wish I had more good news for people. Uh, can I tell you something frankly? Sure. I'm quitting my job. I hate art. Oh. Uh... I'm so sorry to hear that. The... uh... Did you, did you, uh, have information on that lead? - Mm, lead? - You texted me about the artist. Oh, um. Roger Nichols. - Roger Nichols? - Mm-hm. He lives in Parkdale, ten blocks away from here. - Roger Nichols. - I met some people who actually know him and, um, he used to be homeless, but now he has an address. He lives in the Romero House. So, do you know the address? Yeah. Can I have the address? Oh, yes. He lives in Colon Street. Oh, wow. Wow, Roger Nichols. Wow, this is great. This is really, really great. I can't believe you found this, thank you. - You're welcome. - Great. Can I, uh... can I have that? This? Yeah, it's mine. Yeah, okay. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Hi. - Hey. I thought I'd, uh, I thought I'd find Erik here. Oh, uh, I haven't actually seen him today. Oh. He, um. Sometimes I just don't think he gets out of his house. He's not doing so great. Right. Do you want to go for a walk with me? Yeah, yeah, I'd love that. Um, I, I was on my way home actually. Do you mind walking me there? - Sure, that'd be great. - Okay, perfect. I love this time of day. Yeah, why? Well, some photographers call it like the magic hour or the purple hour. It's, uh... sort of when the light burns the brightest, and you get, uh... just the last bit of rays, and then light burns brightest, and then... it's all gone. Hm, kind of like life. I guess. But serious. Yeah. You, uh, you seem to take on a lot of serious in your line of work. Yeah, I do, but then I get to enjoy things like this. Like this? The light, you know. Uh, just get to walk quietly and look and wander. And think, just think, you know? Yeah. Thinking... I love thinking. But I probably do too much of it - for my own good, you know. - Hm. Not enough action. Yeah. Some days I barely get a chance to think. Just try and keep ahead of the rushes of people, and patients and dealing with their problems, you know? - Mm-hm. - You won't believe the stories in some people's lives. You know, just so hard. Most of the time I'm just putting a band-aid on it, you know? Just... putting a band-aid on hurt that people sometimes aren't even aware of, you know? You take on a lot. I do, but it's my job. I'm no savior or anything like that. I understand. Honestly... Sometimes I... there's something in me... that... I need it, you know? I just don't want to be thinking too much. By yourself? Yeah, maybe. This is me. Oh. Yeah, thank you for walking me home. No problem. Um, thanks for sharing the magic hour with me. Yeah, likewise. - Okay. - All right. - See you later. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Morning. - Morning. - Happy birthday, Mom. Thank you, honey. You're dressed up early. So, what's on the cooking agenda for today? It's your party, we have to do something special. Well, I thought we could start with antipasto. You know, veggies from the garden. And then pasta with your favorite sauce. - Nice. - Hm, beautiful, Mom. - Food genius. - I know. Well, um, it sounds like you guys have everything under control. I'll just head out for a bit. Maybe get some flowers or something? - Yeah. - Okay. Bye. Hello, Mr. Nichols? We're out of olive oil. Oh, okay. I can go grab some. Yeah, pick some up. Good. Do you need anything else? Um, just. No, I... If I need something I'll text you. Erik! My velvet gentleman, shaking things up. Yeah, I thought I'd find a new place to sit. You know, break an old habit. I hope you haven't been out all day. It's freezing. Yeah, um. I'm going to meet Damien later and then, um, just go home. Any other plans? No. Listen, it's, uh, it's my Mom's birthday, and my sister and I had planned this whole dinner for her, but she's... Anyway. I would love to have you as our guest. - Me? - Yeah, you, absolutely. We'd love to have you there. I actually don't have anything to wear. What are you talking about? You're perfect as is. Seriously. This is the address. Will you come? Okay. Yes, yes, I will, I will come. Awesome. Uh, five o'clock? My Mom likes to eat early. - Five, okay. - Yeah. I'll be there. See you soon. Oh, yeah, five. Yeah, five o'clock. - Hi, Mark, sorry, I had your address. - Yeah. - Can I come in? - Yes. I need to talk to you for a second. Yeah, come on in. - Listen, Mark, I found him. - Who? I found the guy, the guy we were looking for. The artist. - Wait, really? - Yeah, he lives just over here in Parkdale. Roger Nichols. He's been here right in earshot of my mother this whole time. And now I just don't know if... if I'm doing the right thing. I just wanted to find out more about my Mom and who she was and maybe give her some answers, and I wanted to know what to do about Oscar. And... God, I don't know, I just... Some things are best kept secret. Yeah. If I was her, I think I'd want to know. Oh, you should see this room, it was crazy. It was like this mad genius, and he had... pasted these photos and writings all over the wall and the ceiling and... I was just lost in it. And now I don't know what to do. Wow. April, maybe you're romanticizing this a bit. Yeah. I'll shut up. I think you should do whatever your heart tells you to do. - Daddy? - Phoebe, hey. This is my friend, April. Why don't we go to the park with April? - No. - Why? I don't really know her. Kind of a stranger. Shit, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I have, I have to go, I'm sorry. - Why? - I, I was supposed to be at home for dinner and help them cook all day. It's my Mom's birthday. I'm sorry, I just have to go. - Okay. - Hey, what, uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight? Hi. Um, is this April's house? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is, uh. Oh... um, I'm, I'm Oscar, um. - Oscar, wow. - This is April's house, yes? Uh, ye... yeah, yeah. But... um, she just, she just stepped out for a minute. Um... may I come in? Yeah, yes, of course, please. - Uh, come in, yeah. - Thank you. Uh, uh, Mom, this is, uh, Oscar. Uh, Oscar, this is our mother, Eve. So, you're real. Yes... eh, I'm Oscar. I come here to marry your daughter. Oh, really? When I was away from her I felt... I felt crazy because she's, she's my, my, um... - ...soul twin. - Soulmate. Ah, yes, yes. Soulmate. Do you know when she will be back? Not really, uh, sure where she's gone exactly. She won't be long. Oh, eh. When I was on the plane my, my heart was beating very fast, but I, I, I know that when I ask her she's going to say yes. Oh, so she hasn't... No, she hasn't given him an answer yet. Oh, no, no, but I... You knew about this? I mean, yeah, I guess. - April, what the heck? - Hi. I'm sorry, I... Mom, I brought some guests, this is, uh, this is Mark and Phoebe. I hope it's okay. Is it an inconvenience? Uh, inconvenient? No, no, uh, nothing April does is ever inconvenient. - Hello, Mark. - Hi. Sorry, I didn't catch your name? - I'm Phoebe. - Oh. April? Oscar? What are you, what, oh? What are you doing... Hi. - I missed you so much, mi amor. - Hi. Why aren't you in Argentina? - Hi. - I'm here to be - in Canada. - Oh. Okay. So. You are friends with April? Uh, yeah, yes, we're... - Uh, friends. - Yeah, we're friends, we're friends. April. I, um... I buy only a one-way ticket here to Canada. And I do this because... I want to know if... I'll just go get that. - Erik, hi. - Hi. - I'm sorry I'm late. - No, thanks, it's perfect timing, yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, Erik said he was invited and he wanted me to come along. I hope that's okay. Yes, thank you for coming. You look amazing. My velvet gentleman. I hope it's appropriate. It's perfect. Mom, um, these are my friends, Erik and Damien. I invited them to the party, I hope that's okay. Well, it's a regular house party. I missed you. I missed you too, Oscar. When, when I went back to Argentina... I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. It was like a part of me had been torn out. I know that it was bad to come here and... - No, no, no. - Are you mad? No, I'm not mad. I'm happy that you're here. - I'm crazy, I know. - Yeah, you are crazy. I love you. April, please, you have to tell me. No, let's just talk about this later. - But why? - When it's not at a family dinner. Why don't you go sit down and enjoy yourself, okay? So, I'm glad you guys could actually make it. Oh, April, this is Erik, Erik Satie. Wow, hello, Erik Satie in the flesh. Oh, according to your imaginative sister. Mm, very imaginative, it's a gene that runs in the family. We're both cursed and blessed with it. I think Erik was just a little frightened - to come here by himself, so. - Oh, yeah, sorry. No, thank you for coming with him, honestly, because I don't know if he would have... - Oh, no problem. - ...made, made it out otherwise. - No problem. - You know? Um, I love your tie by the way, I have to say. - Yeah, it's really. - Oh, thanks. Yeah, thank you. - Yeah. - Your leg warmers, killing it. - Oh, thank you, yeah. - You look great. Uh, actually I wanted to talk to you about the thing that we were talking about the other day, okay? Um... and here's the thing that, like, really genuinely scares me. Is it that I do the work because the work is good or do I do the work because it makes me feel good? Well, I mean, what's wrong with having both? You know, I love to play music, right? It bring me joy, but I hope that, you know, it brings joy to others as well. I feel like that's the best, right? when you hit the sweet spot of, of bringing joy to everyone from what you're doing. Jesus, I'm having a mini-existential crisis over here, sorry. That's okay. Mom, come, sit, sit. Yeah, sit down. Okay, everybody, we're ready for dinner. Uh, Erik, why don't you sit beside my mom? Are you hungry, honey? Yes. All right, all right. Let's dig in, yeah. Uh... Mom, why don't you, uh, walk us all through the menu here because you have been doing all of the work, you know. Okay, well, we have antipasto with beans and peppers from the garden. And, in fact, the pasta also has tomatoes from the garden. All fresh. Um. Perhaps the youngest would like to say, or could say grace? Thank you, spirit, for bringing me here to celebrate Eve's birthday. And thank you, spirit, for bringing Oscar on a plane to play lava with me. And thank you, spirit, for all of this delicious food right in front of me. Bravo. - Bravo. - Well done. Okay. Okay, uh, buon appetito. Dig in. So, have you lived here long? Oh, yes, um, quite a long time, yeah. I came to Canada when I was... quite young. Eighteen? No, I mean in this home. Oh... I thought you meant. Mm, um, pasta? Can I pass some pasta? This is very good. - Um, in this home? - Mm-hm. Oh, gosh. Well, the girls grew up here, so yeah, we've been here for years. Thank you. - I'll, I'll hold it. - Oh, thank you so much. I have a friend actually who has one of those... old wheat grinders. - Oh, like a... - It actually grinds the grains. Like a stone. Yeah, kind of. I'd like to see that. So, Oscar, what do you do? Eh. Well, I come here to be with April. But what do you do? Eh, back in Argentina, I... eh, I'm an artist there. Oh. - I hope to start a better... - Great. ...career here. So, so, Damien, that is a British accent, right? - Yes. - Yes, well, see, I often get mistaken for British. It's funny, because I get mistaken for Australian. - So there you go. - That's crazy. I really do. I once had an Australian man mistake me for being Australian, and I don't know how that happens. Where are you from in Italy? Well, my father was from Calabria. But, yeah, when I was little... April, if you want me to leave... Oscar, Oscar, please. - You know how much I had to give up... - Oscar, stop, - ...to come. - Please. We're at a family dinner. Just sit and enjoy your food. April, just tell me, yes or no? Oscar, can we talk about this later, please? - Stop. - I can't. Don't, no, are you leaving? Don't, - Oscar, please, Oscar. - Um, this is very good, yes. I'm, I'm tired, yes. Okay. Uh. Well, maybe we should all go to the living room. - Yeah, okay. - Let's do it. Hey, you good, yeah? So, there's a bit of a tradition when we have guests of a poem or a song, so I thought it was appropriate since we're on the cusp of winter. We're saying goodbye to autumn. poem by John Keats, To Autumn. "Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. Close bosom friend of the maturing sun. Conspiring with him how to load and bless with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run. To bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core. To swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells with a sweet kernel. To set budding more and still more. Later, flowers for the bees until they think warm days will never cease for summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells." That was lovely you two. Yes, very lovely. I had no idea you played. You make a wonderful accompanist. It's almost like you guys have been playing together for years. Um, maybe we should take our leave. - Why? - Yeah, what, why? I haven't been in a family home like this in years. And... you are all lovely people, but I don't know you. You're strangers. It's strange to be in a family home sitting at a dinner table. Erik. I'm sorry. It's kind of you to refer to me as Erik Satie, but I'm not Erik, I'm not Satie. I'm sorry if I disappointed you. I know who you are. Maybe we should go. No, look, I insist. It's my birthday, and so I insist. Please, please, stay. Please, we, we have to have birthday cake. Yes, at least for that. I don't mind, uh, that you're not Erik Satie. All right, everyone ready? - April? - Where's April? April, where are you? Okay. One, two, three. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Mom ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Mom. Happy birthday! I love you so much and you have just been so wonderful to us. You immersed us with literature and music, poetry and everything, and I want to tell you that it's okay, it's okay. We know. Happy birthday. Is this for me? Yeah. Open it. Okay. Did you make these? No, Mom, they are yours. They are yours. And his. Sorry? Roger Nichols. Roger Nichols. - I know. - Who's Roger Nichols? - You, I know. - Sorry? I know, and you guys should be together, you should. I saw it all night. I, I, I have never... The first time I've seen your mother is today. No, no, I've been to your room. I was in your room and I saw it. I saw all of them, and it was wonderful. - You are... - You're a genius, they were everywhere. - April. - And I loved it. Don't you think it's time to drop it? No. April, those... I draw, I, I, I use pen and ink and I... No, I saw, I saw, I saw it, I saw it, I saw it, I saw them! - He's not Roger Nichols. - I have never met your mother before. I, it just... But I found these in the garden, Mom. I never met him until tonight. Then whose art is this? - This isn't my writing. - We should go. Then... Then who are you? I'm just a man. I'm not Roger Nichols, I'm not... I'm just a man. Mom? - April... - But I thought. It's just a mistake, that's all. It's just... I'm... I'm so sorry. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. April? They are quite beautiful. Hey, you think maybe we should be getting going? I'd like to stay if that's okay. He's in good hands. You sure I can leave you alone? I'll be fine. All right then. Sara, uh, really nice chatting to you. Thank you so much for coming, really, really appreciate it. Yeah. Anytime. Get home safe. I'm really tired. I'm going to go to bed. - Hey. - Hi, Dad. How you doing? - I'm good. - Yeah? Hey, there's Josh. Josh, from your school? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Well, he's my boyfriend. - Your boyfriend? - Yes. - Really? Josh! Dad, this is Josh. - Hey, Josh. - Hello. - How are you? - Good. - Good? - I might marry him one day. - Really? - You want to go back to the swings? Yeah.
