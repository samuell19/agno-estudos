I never did find out what happened to her. She could be dead. But I doubt it. I like to think of her some wild place far a away. And where else could she be. Because that's the place she holds in my heart. O que voce tem pra beber? Sure. Who is that music by? The tape? It's by Ivan Jones Group. Why? Who's there. Zeke! You bastard. What the hell do you think you're doing! I thought I'd teach you a lesson. How many time have I warned you about sleeping with the door open? You're luck it was only me. The city's filled with weirdos. Christ. What a nightmare. I got something to tell you. The landlord was around again yesterday Says if he didn't get some rent money from you soon he'd throw you out on the street. So what're you going to do? 1 don't know. Look, it's a bad period, you just gotta ride it out. If you need some bucks to see you through, just let me know. I'm getting work. The gig is paying really well. O Christ, Zeke, you're a good friend, and I love you, but I can't take money from you... now why don't you get out of here. Dearest Sonia, I hope this letter get to you. Your phone is out and we've been so worried as we haven't heard from you in ages. Anyway there's so much I have to tell you. As you know, Judge Stewart had always shown Lily and myself a special kindness. But then he let his infatuation for your sister get the best of him. Things went from bad to worse when Miss Bealzy overheard a scene and reported it to Mrs. Stewart. Of course, Ms. Stewart gave us both our notices. Thank God the truth came out and the Judge admitted it was he who was to blame and not Lily. Well, Mrs. Stewart apologized profusely, but says of course, she can't take us back! But to make a long story short, Mrs. Stewart has a nephew, Lowell, who has been crazy about your sister for ages, and he steps up and says he wants to marry Lily. 1 don't think she would have considered it before, but I think she's thinking as much about me as herself, though of course she'd never admit it. But you should be hearing from Lily herself in a couple of days. Til then, take care and be well. All my love, Mother. I'm here to see Mr. White. He busy. Come back later. Tell him Sonia's here. Sonia's. Good. Have a seat, Miss Ivanovna. I Presume you've come to make good on your debts. I1 don't have the money. You don't have the money. That's bad. That's very bad indeed. When, may I ask, do you expect that you'll have it? 1 don't know. That doesn't sound very good at all. I'm a very thorough man. And I have many friends in this town. And as we all know, friendship is based on mutual benefit. I rub your back and you rub mine. Only I've been patiently rubbing your back and I get nothing in return. What do you want from me? What do I want from you! Come now, dear, don't be naive. I know you've been around. I want you to be nice to me. I want you to get dressed up nice and sexy and drag your sweet little white pussy up here tonight at eight o'clock. What! You heard me, babe. I ain't foolin' wit' you no more. Eight o'clock. That gives you seven hours to think about it. And you best come to the right decision because ol' Nicky here got a real dark nasty side that you don't want to know about. Good. But cheer up, Sonia. If you, perform half as good as you look, I could find you a real nice place here in my organization, pay off some of that nasty rent. Simon! Show Miss Ivanovna to the door. Concerns of judges, four letters. Quick. The door's opening, Jeff. What do you want from me, Travis. Take the fucking picture. So I say: you wanna come into the dirty room or you wanna come into the filthy room, -so he says. -l know, I know, don't tell me. I told you what would happen and what happens? It happened. Hey, Louie, beer. Hello, baby. I was expecting you. Hey, why so glum? Forget about it. It's on Louie. -Babe, -Hello. I'd like you to meet Tony Goldblum. Tony's the guy I've been telling you about. Knows how to get the job done. A real dynamo. Tony, this is Sonia. Well, what do you think? Well, Irv, I must say you know how to pick. She'll be just perfect for the role. So very pleased to meet you, my dear. So pleased to meet you too, Mr. Goldblum. Tony, please. Tony, then. Waiter, bring a bottle of your best champaign. Sonia, I'd like you to meet the man who wrote our script, Fyodor Ivanovna. -Pleased to meet you. -Enchanted. -And Glen Nivens who will direct you. -Welcome aboard. Hello. Atoast. To fame and fortune. -Cheers. -Cheers Now Glen, why don't you talk Sonia through the film. Be delighted to, Irv. What I see is a big film, an epic, based loosely, of Course, on the Bhagavad-Gita. We'll shoot on location in India with, quite literally, a cast of thousands. As a matter of fact we have an entire army of Sihks lined up to be extras in the battle scenes. The story features Arjuna, the philosopher king, who I think, knock on wood, will be played by Sly Stallone. You'll be playing opposite him as his wife, and the role of Lord Krisna, King of the Heavens, is still up in the air. If I may, Glen, I've heard from his agent, again, knock on wood, that Jeremy Irons may be interested. That's terrific, but I'll believe it when I see it on paper. Anyway, as the film opens, Arjuna finds that his son has been leading an insurrection. His lands are being pillaged, his Subjects raped and murdered. In fact, the first forty minutes or so will be devoted quite graphically to these atrocities... I think you better take it from here, Fyo. I think Sonia should hear this in the words of the Creator himself. Thanks, Glen. You see, Miss Borges, the scene is this. Arjuna is looking out across a war-torn battlefield. Because of his morals he cannot act. Then the Heavens. open and Krisna appears in all his glory. He says: My son, I have heard your prayers and I answer. Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these warriors. Nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. Just as the embodied soul continuously passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The body will surely perish but the soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon nor burned by fire, nor withered by wind. Therefore, those who are wise neither lament the living nor the dead. So fight on, my son, or the great warriors who do so highly esteem you, will think that you have left the battlefield out of fear only... and for a respectable person disdain is worse than death. Hey, Sonia, you want the last shot? Sure. Easy now, babe. Right in the Corner. That's it, not too hard. All right! One more baby? No thanks. God, I'm sorry. You finished with that, or do you finish me off? Thank you, you a good woman. Now I show you how to use this. I have a lot of practice. You a pretty girl. You a singer? I'm an actress. Actress? Would you do something for me. I been out drinking two days now. know where I got the money? I stole it from my boy. He's a singer too. Prettiest Voice you ever heard. Came back two days ago with money from a gig down at Club Seven. I stole it. But I gotta go back now and I needs someone to walk me home. Can't go myself. Just to the door. It's not far. What do you say, honey? Do an old lady a favor. I sure would appreciate it. Ok. I'll walk you to your door. My, my. This place is just filled with my good friends. Drunk as usual, Ida. And I see our mutual friend Lucille has been putting one over on me. Isn't that right, Lucille? Isn't there some place you should be, dear? C'mon, babe. We better get out of here. I just stopped in two minutes to have a beer and play a game. Come on, Nicky, I was just getting ready to go when you came in. Come on, babe, let's get out. Please. I can't watch his shit. We should do something. We can't do nothing, baby. You know who that is? Yeah, I know. You bastard! 1'm not fooling with you no more, bitch. What the hell are you doing in here? Go away. Jesus Christ, woman! You out of your fucking head? Leaving three hungry kids, and takin' off with all our goddamned money! What you standin' there for, boy! You get out of your fucking head? Hangin' out with your friends. Forgot your phone number? Here. Buy some milk for your brother and get yourself something to eat. Hey baby, you the one that walked Ida home? Never have there been a time when I didn't exist. Nor you or all these warriors. -Yeah. She's upstairs. -Good. You OK? I heard you ran into Nicky White. He didn't rough her up did he? Nicky White? No, he didn't. Good. He lays a hand on my mama again and he's a dead man. You OK? You need me to walk you somewhere? I'm ok. All right. Take good care of yourself now, ok? OK. Hey! Come on in, you're right on time. White! Open up. I'm from Tinelli. Did you hear that? He's in there alright. White, open the fucking door, you black bastard, or We'll kick it in. Fucking Christ! We've been set up. Let's get the fuck out of here. I'm sick of sushi every night. Why can't we try for some thing different, for a change? That's just the way I am. I gotta be nice to people. Why don't you watch where yer going. Jesus Christ! Here, dear, get yourself a cup of coffee. All right. Thank you. I can't believe it, it's like a family affair. White, 'Cille, Jonah, Wayne... the Mystery Raincoat Man will probably turn out to be someone we know too. What are you guys talking about. Well! Welcome back to the land of the living. You been out for three days. You missed the big story. Lowell Ingals. Does Sonia live here? Yep. Sonia. I'm Lowell Ingals, Lily's fiance. Your mother and Lily will be coming to town tonight. I thought I'd come by to meet you. They've been worried about you. She's been sick. Delirious, with a high fever. Lowell Ingals. Zeke. This is lvan. You artists? No, we're musicians. How bout yourself? I'm an artist. Really? You paint? What do you do? No, I work down at MTV. Actually, I'm on the business side right now, but that's not what I'm about. I'm an idea man really. You guys see this? Pretty fing amazing. Happened right near here, too? -Yeah, we heard all about it. -Wild shit, man, wild shit. Look at there pictures. What a blood bath. That poor whore. Who got hacked up. And that guy. White. What'd they say he got "emasculated" you know what that means, don't you means he got his balls cut off! What I want to know is how they got these photos. Hey, I'll see you later. I'll see you tonight. Hey, nice to meet you, man. The amazing thing is... What's incredible to me is how complicated they make the news when it's so simple, really. How's that, Lowell? Well, when you get down to it, human motivation's pretty simple. I mean it all really comes down to money and sex. on this earth anyway am I right? I mean, okay, good friends, art. I mean of course art's important, Christ, I'm an artist... but on the basic level you gotta eat, right? You gotta fuck. Money and sex. so what happens? You got this whore, she goes to see her pimp, White. While she's there, some other whore comes in Some girl he fucked over one too many times. Or little over the edge So she comes down like the first whore and chopping him up into little pieces so she carved her up too. Bingo. Double murder. Meanwhile the cops are tripping over themselves to implicate the Mafia etcetera, etcetera. It makes me laugh. You've got it all figured out, haven't you, Lowell? Look, I'm just saying how... Money and sex. Money and sex! Is that how you see my sister? Some whore you're going to buy off with your filthy money? That's not fair. I love your sister! What the fuck do you know about love? I thought all human motivation is money and sex! Just get the fuck out of my apartment you little shit! You heard me. Get out of here! Get out! You too, Zeke. Get out of here, -just get out and leave me alone. -Sonia. I will, I'm going. There's a flyer on the table. We're having a party tonight. Look, Jonah, this is your territory and I appreciate you wanting to tie up loose end, especially since it's gotten so blown up in the press. But you have to appreciate our position. We're after something much bigger here. And this station's been ordered shut down. It never existed. These guys here are Tortelli's. Now we agree that the knife thing isn't their usual style. But they're both dead now, and we're willing to let it rest. For now. Look, Ben, I don't want to step on any toes. But I have a feeling word, nothing to the press or the home boys. All I need are some copies of these photos. All right, Jonah, I'll see what I can do. Planning another big evening? Dressed to kill? What are you doing here? Lighten up, babe. Just kidding. Hey, you've got a run in your stocking, you're not going out like that, are you? It's not as though you couldn't afford another pair. What do you want here? If you can just fly around why don't you fly off to the police and tell them who killed you? I can't do that, even if I wanted to. They wouldn't see me. Most people don't you know, they wouldn't allow themselves to. It would be too upsetting. In fact, most people are so narrow that they define their entire universe in terms of one or two obsessions. Like pimping and selling drugs. You know, you really should lighten up. I don't think you got the worst of our brief association. You got just what you deserved. You know, you don't know how true that is. All my life I was obsessed with sex. All the rest was just a means to more and better sex. Then to get it like that. Beautiful. I wonder how you'll get yours. Well, I really must be going, so much to do. I enjoyed our little visit though. But I wouldn't tell anyone about it if I were you. Oh, and Sonia: Thank you. I really feel I learned something from our little experience. Like what? Well, I know you're not too big on the old Testament... but I suppose I learned something along the lines of you reap just what you sow. Well, goodbye. And good luck. Sonia, so glad you made it. Soaml. Sonia! I knew you'd come, well I didn't know it I'm so happy you're here. Everybody, this is Sonia. Wait a sec, I have something for you. This is the mask of the ancient Egyptian Dream Bird. The Egyptians of this period believed that all men but Kings were subject to predestination. Likewise were all beasts and birds, save the Dream Bird. This dream bird can fly into any destination with every purpose so desire. But! Once it had decided its course it had to fly without ever resting and without ever deviating one inch from its path of flight or else it would fly straight into the flames of Hell! So, where are you going to fly to, Sonia? Sonia, meet my cousin Jonah. Jonah, Sonia. Pleased to meet you, though we've sort of met. So where will you fly to? Closer, Jonah. Soon I'll be so near you won't be able to see me. You're making me sweat. What do you do? I'm an actress. An actress eh? That's wonderful. Maybe you can help me out. You see I've just had quite a little brush with the flames myself. Forget it Jonah. She's been sick. The last thing she wants to hear about tonight is the White case. Not at all, Zeke, I'm fascinated. What's your angle on this, I'm dying to hear. -You don't know? -No. This is my case. I'm the detective. And? And, well, as an actress I thought maybe you could put yourself in my shoes for a minute so I can get your reaction to my experience. I'm set. Do your worst. I like this woman. So dramatic. OK, picture this. It's early morning. You're asleep in bed. The phone rings. It's a call you've gotten so many times before. You dress quickly and slog out into the freezing mist. to a building not so far from here. You trudge up the stairs. You push past the officers at the top of the stairs and enter into the apartment. You see a beautiful young blond hired girl in a black dress. Her throat is cut from ear to ear, oozing dark black blood. Sonia. Please. I'm sorry, babe. I'm so sorry. Sonia. You OK? I must apologize, Sonia, all this talk of murder and blood must be too much for a woman in your delicate condition. It's, it's my fever. This place is so stuffy. I have to get out of here. -l need some air. -I'll walk you. That's OK. Sonia, I know this is hardly the time to bring this up, but I'd like to ask you to come down to my office, if possible, tomorrow, anytime, II'l be there all day. I'd like to ask you some routine questions, you see, we want to talk to everyone who knew White at all, in order to help us get the facts' straight. It should only take a few moments. There's nothing I can tell you that would help. Please, it'll only take a few minutes of your time, and there's no telling... sometimes the most insignificant little fact helps break a case like this. Sure, I'll go down. Now I really gotta get out of here. I need air. Go ahead. I gotta find my jacket and I'll go after you. Can I help you? Who cleaned up all the blood? What? Everything's so different. I think you better get out of here. I've been here before. I'll bet you have. Now get the hell out. Maybe we ought to call the police, Brad. Yeah, Brad, maybe we ought to. Get the hell out! Before I kick your ass! Jesus, call the landlord. Thank God. Are you OK? Give me my bag back. -Give me my bag back. -Let her go, damn it. You heard me. You're gonna be all right now. Way to go, baby. This is so good. You are so good. How come this hasn't been on the radio? -Well, actually,... -Isn't this good, mother. I don't understand this music but you are very nice man, Zeke. Where is Sonia? I1 don't like standing on street in this place. 1 don't like it. I read about murder. Right here. I come from murder! There was a murder in Greenwich, Connecticut? What? You think only in New York there is murder? You don't read the paper? Judge Stewart, Who we used to work for, they say he killed his wife who was a diabetic, by tampering with her insulin injection. They say! They say! After how he treated my Lily, We know what kind of man is this! So we'll definitely see you tomorrow then? -Yeah, yeah, definitely. -Great, I'm really looking forward to it. OK, Lily I think we must let Mr. Zeke get some sleep now. Thank you so much. We see you tomorrow. And you will make sure Sonia will be here too. Don't worry about a thing. I wrote it all down, and I'll tell her myself. Pleasure to meet you. -Good night. -Good night. Sonia. Come in. Come over here please. There. See that fish. It's a catfish. He eats garbage. I know just how he feels. Sometimes I stare at that fish for hours. I feel the air get wet and heavy. I feel my face get scaly. The metamorphosis. That's the thrill of this job. I've been a three hundred pound bejeweled black pimp. I've been a psychotic pimply teenage junky. But you... you touch me in a different way. you take me way from all of this but... I know it can't last. I know I'll end up back here in this stuffy little office. And I know that no matter how close I get, it's still like I've got my face pushed up against the glass. In a way it's terribly pathetic. You're like a little Child afraid to take a step. I have no pity for you. God you thrill me. You really do. Each word, each gesture takes me away to distant exotic lands. Jonah, this is fascinating but I'm sure you'll understand that I have problems of my own to attend to. So if you don't mind I think we should continue this some other time. Oh, Sonia. I'm afraid you misunderstand me. 1 didn't ask you here to talk about my fish. I know you killed Mr. White. What makes you think that? It's not conjecture, dear. I know you killed white. So why don't you arrest me. O, I'm going to arrest you. But all in good time. You see, first I want to get under your skin. I know you killed White, but I don't know why you killed him. You're accusing me of murder, but you have no motive? I have plenty of motives. You need money. But you didn't kill White for money. He propositioned you perhaps tried to force himself on you. But that's not why you killed him either. I could make it stick, but that's not what I'm after. I want the real motive. You're crazy. I didn't do it. Of course I respect that you have to say that. But I'm sure you'll respect my position. I'm going to find out what I have to know. Tell me about the day of the murder. What did you do? -Oh, come on. -I'm not fooling with you. I want a full account. Please sit down. Thank you. OK, Jonah. I1 woke up... -l went to see white. -Why? -I got a message from Wayne, a kid Who... -I know who Wayne is. What happened at White's? He wanted money. -I owed him money. -How much? -l don't know, a couple of thousand. -What did you tell him? I said I didn't have it. He said then I'd have to fuck him. He said think about it and come back later. I came back and told him to shove it. That's all I know. Slow down, slow down. I'm in no rush. I want to hear everything. You walked up his stairs, you rang his buzzer. Can you hear the buzzer? He opened the door. What did he say to you. Word for word. I can't remember exactly. I had a fever. I still have a fever. He must have said "Come in." What was he wearing? What did he smell like? You have nothing to hide. He wore a suit, -he always wears, wore a suit. -The smell. What did he smell like? He wore cologne. It was strong. I don't know. Was it like this? Go on smell it. That's it. Did he smell like that? Yeah, maybe. It could have been. I don't know. Now careful, dear. Exactly how long were you there? A few minutes, I don't know. A few? Two? Five? Ten? Fifteen? -Five or ten, I don't remember. -You were there for seventeen minutes. What was it like, Sonia, to feel that blade sink into soft human flesh? How did it feel? I need to know. Then why don't you stab someone. I have no idea. Where did you go after you fainted last night? -l went to Ida's house she was... -Before that! ... -You went to White's. What did you expect to feel there? A thrill, Jonah. Just like you. I expected to feel a little second hand thrill, and that's just what I got. What about the money? What money? After you left White's you dropped a 100 dollar bill at X's. This seems extravagant for a woman who can't pay off a 2000 dollar debt. -Where did you get it? -It's a lie. It couldn't have been 100 dollars. I have a room full of withesses. Where did you get it? It was a mistake, I have a little money. -l was delirious. -Let me see your purse. No! Show it to me. What are you hiding? I'm not hiding anything. 1 won't let you bully me anymore! I'm not scared of you. arrest me, because I'm walking out of here right now. You're not going anywhere. Oh, you're heart's beating like thunder, I can feel you right through you wrist. I'm so close, so close. Get off me! Those seventeen long minutes. The money. The return to the scene of the crime. They add up my friend. I know you it. But why? You must tell me why. Not now, for God's sake! But detective, it's over. We got a confession from him. What? It's true. I killed White and I killed Cillie. How? I cut 'em with my knife. Where's the knife? -l don't know. -Why'd you do it? 'Cause I love Cille. Oh jesus Christ. I'm so sorry for this interruption, Sonia. Just When I felt we were getting so close. Don't mention it. I really must be going. Don't go far. I have a feeling We'll be chatting again very soon. Goodbye, Jonah. Goodbye Sonia. And take care of that nasty fever. Waitress! I'd like a glass of white wine. Good afternoon, friend. I'm Judge Stuart. I'm pleased to finally make an acquaintance. What do you want? What do I want? What don't I want. I'm a man of great appetites, as I'm sure you've heard. What do you want with me? You fascinate me. I've been in the city over a week now, and I've spent much of the time just following you around. You're a tremendously interesting woman. I've seen many fantastic things. Yeah? Like what? Seen any murders? There's been quite a few colorful murders down here lately. Really? You should watch yourself. This can be a dangerous neighborhood. But you seem like you could be a dangerous woman. Oh? How so? A man could fall in love with you just by looking at you. Then that would be his problem. Would it? Perhaps it could be to your advantage. It just hasn't seemed to work out that way, Judge. Whose fault is that? Take me, for example. I'm quite a wealthy man now. I've heard. You poisoned your wife. Congratulations. You've heard that, too. It's absolutely untrue, of course. I was quite fond of my wife. But there was that unfortunate incident with your sister. which was not entirely my fault. Victim of circumstance? Oh, my dear, I've never been a Victim. But I fell in love with your sister. Right, Judge, sure. So why are you following me around? I told you, you fascinate me. You remind me so much of how I used to be. Your way of thinking, the places you hang out, the problems you've Created for yourself. -What do you want from me, Judge. -Cool down. I want to tell you my wife left your sister 50,000 dollars in her will. What? 50,000 dollars. And my wife came round last night and suggested I give her 100,000 more. Which I was planning to do anyway. Your wife? Your wife is dead. Yeah, she came right through the front door. Didn't even bother to knock. It really bugs me he way she never knocks. Don't you believe in ghosts? Yeah, I guess I do. I knew it! A real kindred spirit. I think we could become great friends! Life certainly has a funny way of working itself out. I'm so cold. I'm listening. I'm the one. I killed White, I killed Cille. I know what you did. I dressed up. I went to White's. I let him touch me. I let him think he could have me. I took my knife. I stabbed him... until he was dead. Lucille came in. I stabbed her to death. That's it. White's dead. Cille's dead. Ida's dead. You can't take no pride. You can't feel no shame. The minute you do you're not living anymore. You're remembering. You just gotta figure out what you're going to do next. What can I do? I can't tell you that. 1 got a lot of money now. We could run off. Go to Europe, maybe south America. We could sing together, play all the clubs. I can't go anywhere. 1 got three kids to take care of, not to mention old Lester. And how far you gonna get running with a black man in tow? Besides, what you wanna run off with an old alcoholic singer for anyway? Don't talk about yourself that way. I've heard you sing, you have a beautiful voice, you're still young. You can do anything you want. How old do you think I am? 1 don't know. -What difference does it make? -I'm thirty-seven. 1 got kids, alimonies, no money, no agent, no connections. When Ida was my age she was already a big star. And look how she ended up. Listen to you. You sound worse than I do. It doesn't have to be that way. You've got the voice. You've got the warmth and the presence. You've got the soul. People will feel it, they'll sense it. They'll hear you, Moe, you've got everything it takes. Yeah, but this ain't no fairy tale. Things don't always turn out like they should. That's no way to think. You gotta believe in yourself. I believe in you. Why? Because you're the most beautiful man I've ever known. Good morning. So you like my brother. Yeah, where is he? He had to go out, but he told me be would like to see you real soon. I think he likes you. There's coffee in the kitchen. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about. It's about Sonia. I know why She's been acting so strange. She's in trouble and I think I can help. But we can't talk here. I think I'm being watched. We'll have to go up to my room. All right. Well? Well, I got to the city about a week ago. I began to visit my old haunts on the Lower East Side from way back when. One day, on a whim, I decided to look up your sister. She looked so much like you. On a whim, I decided to follow her. This proved to be very entertaining for an old man of leisure. Your sister is a very strange bird. I wondered when she would notice me. Then one day I had been following. Her the whole day. Around dusk she come out of her apartment in a most astounding costume, or should I say disguise. An old overcoat with her hair tucked up under a cap! Well, I followed her to a place she had been earlier that day. She went in for about half an hour less and then came out, shed her disguise... and went to the bar she frequents a wonderful place... where she tipped the singer with a one hundred dollar bill! The next day the papers were filled with the double murder the time and place she had been the night before. 1 don't believe a word of it. You're trying to trick me. I wish I were. But you must have noticed how strange her behavior has been. I swear to you every word of it is true. And what's more, the police are on to her. She must be getting very panicky. My God, I just can't believe it. Not believing it is not going to help your sister. You're going to have to get a hold of yourself and think this through. Think this through. All right. You obviously have something in mind. Let's hear it. All right. As I see it your sister has one chance. She has to get out of the country immediately. I mean now. To do that she needs money and the right connections. Which she doesn't have. Exactly. But I do. In fact right here I have tickets, Visas, and all the money we need. We're booked non a flight to Rio de Janeiro this evening. Why are you doing this. Not I, dear. We. Your sister's safety is entirely dependent on you. I'm extremely wealthy, I'm intelligent, educated, I have a healthy sense of humor, and I'm single. I'll marry you the second we get to Rio. I've never stopped loving you. But, I don't love you. I can't go anywhere with you. You frighten me. I1 don't see that you have much choice, unless you want me to pick up the phone and tell the police what I saw. You do what you have to do, Judge. I don't want any part of you. 1 will do what I have to do. I love you. I've never loved anything so much in my life. I have to have you. I'm so sorry it has to be this way, but I can't live without you. Get off me! Stop it! You don't know what you're doing. I love you! Help me! You can scream. No one will pay any attention. -This is what this hotel is for. -Help. Anybody? Listen, Judge, I know you too well not to come here prepared. Now give me the key. You're going to have to shoot me, Lily. It's not so easy to kill a man. But maybe you can do it. -It seems to run in the family. -Stay away from me! Here, I'll make it easy for you. One more step and I'll kill you. Don't Judge. Then you feel nothing for me. Get out. I am victory, adventure, and the strength of the strong. What are you doing here? I've come to find you. How long have I been asleep? My God. What you must think! I'm terribly Sorry. This has been a terrible strain. But it's over now. I've gone as far as I can go. This investigation is drawing to a close. I've come to a decision. I'm going to give you twenty-four hours. You'll be watched at all times. Here's the situation. We have a guy who's confessed. No one suspects you. If you turn yourself in at a time like this, they could go real easy on you. You could get off with temporary insanity and spend just a few years in an institution. The rest will do you good. This is as far as I'll go with you. Twenty-four hours, my friend. Twenty-four hours. Go away. What the hell do you want? -Move. Shut up. Keep quiet. -What is this all about? There's no time to lose. There's a flight from JFK to Rio that leaves in a few hours. I have an extra ticket. If you want it, that's all the time you have to decide. What? You heard me. There's nothing left for me here. If you feel the same way, I'm offering you a way out. Why? Why not? Sometimes it's just as easy to be a good guy as it is to be a prick. Look there's no strings attached, but you have to decide immediately, we don't have much time. -Hi. Is Ivan here? -Nope. Look, Darnell, this is very important. -l want you to listen carefully, OK? -OK. I want you to wait here until lvan comes home. Don't go anywhere. When he gets here I want you to give him this. It's terribly, terribly important. -Do you think you can do that for me? -Yes. All right. Good bye. Look, I'll meet you on the plane. There are a few phone calls I need to make. Well, like I said, I never did find out what happened to her. She could be dead. But I doubt it. When she passes away, I'll feel it in my bones. Anyway, I don't need to tell you that folder was filled with money. A lot of money. But it wasn't just the money neither. That woman gave me back my self respect. It's like everyone wanted her. But she chose me. And I pray every night that she's resting easy wherever she is. Anyway, you wanted to know how I got started and it's kind of a roundabout story, but that's exactly how it happened. Leastwise that's how I remember it. Man, Ivan, you tell it different every time. What was different? The part about how she killed him. I don't know. Everything. Anyway, what about some of the others, you never told me that. What happened to Zeke? Zeke? You don't know? He's got a band the Sand Blasters. That's his band? Shit yeah, they got the most popular video on MTV this year. How about Lily? Lily married some rich guy from Long Island. A tennis player, I think. And Jonah? Well, Jonah's a strange one. I filled in a lot of the story from information 1 got from him and Zeke too. But you never know how much to believe of want Jonan says. Anyway he quit his job a couple of years ago and went into private practice. Then a year ago he just disappeared. Zeke says he went traveling.
