(Gasps, groans) (Waves crashing) (Wind howling) Come away, servant. I'm ready for you now. Come away, my Ariel! Approach! Come! I'm ready for you now, my Ariel. Come! - (Groaning) - Ariel! (Chimes tinkling) Ariel! Come! (Ariel whispers) 'All hail, great master. 'Grave, sir, hail. 'I come to answer thy best pleasure 'be't to fly, to swim, to dive into the fire, 'to ride on the curled cloud. 'To thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality.' Hast thou, spirit, performed to point the tempest that I bade thee? (Thunderclap) To every article. I boarded the King's ship. Now on the beak. Now in the waist. The deck, in every cabin I flamed amazement. Hm, my brave spirit. Not a soul, but felt a fever of the mad. All plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel. The King's son Ferdinand was the first man that leapt. Cried, "Hell is empty and all the devils are here!" (Guffaws) (Wind howling) (Fire crackling) (Wind howling) ' (Spits) ' (Gasps) Oh! (Guffaws) (Door slams) Shh! (Guffaws) Slave! Caliban. Thou earth! 'Tis a villain, sir. Mm! I do not like to look on. As 'tis, we cannot miss him. He makes our fire, fetches in our wood and serves in offices that profit us. Be collected. No more amazement. Oh. Lovely. Hmm! (Guffaws) Canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell? 'Tis time I should inform thee further. I do not think thou canst, for thou wast then but three years old. Certainly, sir, I can. 'Tis far off... rather like a dream. Had I not four... ...five women... ...once tended me? Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. Seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time? (Clattering) (Prospero) Thou poisonous slave! Got by the devil himself, upon thy wicked dam, come forth! (Whimpers) (Groans, yells) (Groans) As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed with raven's feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both! A southwest blow on ye and blister you all o'er! For this, tonight, be sure that thou shalt have cramps. Side- stitches that shall pen thy breath up. Thou shalt be pinch'd as thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging that bees that made 'em. I must eat my dinner. This island's mine by Sycorax my mother, which thou take'st from me. When thou cam'st first thou strok'st me and made much of me... ...and then I loved thee. And showed thee all the qualities of th'isle. Cursed be I that did so! All the charms of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! For I am all the subjects that you have, which first was mine own King! Thou most lying slave! I have used thee, filth as thou art, with human care and lodged thee in mine own cell... ...till thou didst seek to violate my child. (Guffaws) Would't had been done! Thou didst prevent me. I had peopled else this Isle with Calibans. You taught me language and my profit on't is I know how to curse! The red plague rid you for learning me your language. Hag- seed, hence. Fetch us in some fuel. Be quick! İf thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly what I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps, fill all thy bones with aches. So slave, hence! (Thud) (Whispers) I must obey. His art is of such power it would control my dam's god, Setebos, and make a vassal of him. Ooh. (Groans) (Laughs) (Guffaws) (Prospero pants) A devil, a born devil on whose nature nurture could never stick and on whom my pains, humanely taken, all lost, quite lost, and as with age his body uglier grows so doth his mind canker. Ugh! There's no harm done, have comfort. Art inclined to sleep? Mm. 'Tis a good dullness. Give it way. (Seagulls squawking) (Ariel) 'Safely in harbour is the King's ship... '...in the deep nook, where once thou call'd me up at midnight 'to fetch dew from the still- vexed Bermothes. 'The mariners all under hatches stow'd, I have left asleep. 'The King's son have I landed by himself.' (Laughs) (Prospero) Time twixt now and six must by us both be spent most preciously. (Ariel) 'ls there more toil? 'What shall I do, say what? 'What shall I do?' (Prospero) 'Go make thyself like a nymph of the sea. 'Be subject to no sight but thine and mine. 'Invisible to every eyeball else.' (Seagulls squawking) (Ariel) J' Full fathom five J' thy father lies. J' Of his bones are coral made. J' Those are pearls that were his eyes. J' Nothing of him that doth fade. J' But doth suffer a seachange, J' into something rich and strange. J' Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell. J' Ding- dong. J' Ding- dong bell. J' (Ferdinand) 'Where should this music be? 'The air or the earth. 'It sounds no more. 'Sure it waits upon some god of the island. 'Sitting on a bank, 'weeping again the King my father's wreck, 'this music crept by me upon the waters, 'allaying both their fury and my passion 'with its sweet air. 'Thence I have follow'd it, 'or it hath drawn me rather. "Tis gone. No, begins again.' (Seagulls squawking) (I Sinister music) (Dogs barking) (Fire crackling) (Heavy breathing) (Hums) (Guffaws) (Blows a raspberry) (Guffaws) (Keyhole squeaks) (Chuckles) (Hums) (Lip- smacking) (Ariel) Honour, riches, marriage, blessing, long continuance, and increasing. Hourly joys be still upon you. Juno sings her blessings on you. Earth's increase, foison plenty. Barnes and garners never empty. Vines with clustering bunches growing, Plants with goodly burthen bowing. Spring comes to you at the farthest in the very end of harvest. (Owl hooting) (I Sombre music) Mmm! What is't? A spirit? No, Wench. It eats and sleeps and hath such senses as we have. Mmm! Nothing natural I ever saw so noble. (Chuckles) It goes on as my soul prompts, fine spirit. Thou shall be free in two days for this. (Fire crackling) Most sure... the goddess on whom these airs attend. I charge thee. Thou hast put thyself upon this Island as a spy, to win it from me. No, as I'm a man. (Prospero) Follow me. Pfft! Speak not for him. He's a traitor. (Miranda) Oh, dear father! Silence. Make not too rash a trial for him. For He's gentle. Silence. One more word shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. Foolish Wench. (Snickers) To th'most of men... this is a Caliban! (Raucous laughter) (I Classical frenetic music) (Guffaws) (Caliban) Beat him enough, and after a little time, I'll beat him, too. (Guffaws) (Prospero) Come. I'll manacle thy feet. Sea water shalt thou drink. Thy food shall be withered roots and husks wherein the acorn cradle. (I Classical frenetic music) (Fire crackling) (Snores) (Miranda) 'There's nothing ill that can dwell in such a temple if the ill spirit hath so fair a house, good things will strive to dwell with't.' (Door squeaks) (Thud) (Creaking) (Guffaws) (Caliban) Ah! Be of comfort. My father's of a better nature, sir, then he appears by speech. This is unwonted that now came from him. İf you'll sit down, I'll bear your logs. - Give me that. - No, precious creature. I had rather crack my sinews than you should such dishonour undergo. (Prospero) Come! - (Shouts) - Come, follow. Come, follow. (Door closes) (Thud) (Cracking) (Exhales deeply) My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father's loss, the wreck of all my friends, the weakness that I feel, are but light to me. Might I but through my prison once a day behold this maid? (imitates explosion) (Grunts) (Miranda grunting) (Clacking teeth) (Clacking teeth continues) Fair encounter... ...of two most rare affections. Thou hast done well, fine Ariel. Thou shalt be free as mountains winds... ...but then exactly do all points of my command. To the syllable. (Waves crashing) (Gonzalo) Beseech you, sir, be merry, you have cause, so have we all, of joy, for our escape is beyond our loss. Our hint of woe is common, every day, some sailor's wife, the masters of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe, but for the miracle our preservation, few in millions could speak like us, then wisely, good, sir, weigh our sorrows with our comfort. He receives comfort like cold porridge. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on in Africa, at the marriage of the King's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. 'Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return. You cram these words into my ears. Would I had never married my daughter there for coming thence my son is lost and I ne'er again see her. (Groans) (Seagulls squawking) (Snores and sighs) Will you grant that Ferdinand is drowned? He's gone. Tell me, then, who's the next heir of Naples? Claribel. She that is Queen of Tunis. She that dwells ten leagues beyond man's life. She that from Naples can have no note, unless the sun were post. The man I' th' moon's too slow. What a sleep were this for your advancement. Do you understand me? I think I do. Here lies your brother. No better than the earth he lies upon. As thou got'st Milan, I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke shall free thee from the tribute that thou pay'st and I the King shall love thee. (Wind howling) While you here do snoring lie. Open- eyed conspiracy his time doth take. If of life you keep a care, shake off slumber and beware. Awake! - Awake! - (Gasps) (Gonzalo) Good angels, preserve the King! (Alonso) Why? How now? Why are you so drawn? Wherefor this ghastly looking? (Sebastian) While we stood securing your repose, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing. (Alonso) I heard nothing. (Antonio) Sure it was the roar of a whole herd of lions. (Alonso) Heard you this, Gonzalo? I heard a humming. And a strange one. 'Tis best we stand on guard. (Alonso) Let us make further search for my poor son. Lead the way. (Laughs) Prospero, my Lord, shall know what I have done. So, King, go safely on to seek thy son. (Laughs) (Heavy breathing) (I Sinister music) You have often begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd concluding, "Stay! Not yet!" The hour's now come. The very minute bids thee open thine ear. Obey and be attentive. Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since... ...thy father was the Duke of Milan, and a Prince of Power. O the heavens! What foul play had we that we came from thence? Being transported and rapt in secret studies the government I cast upon my brother... ...and to my state became a stranger. Thy false uncle. - Antonio? - Hmm. I pray thee, mark me, that a brother should be so perfidious! He being thus lorded, not only with what my revenue yielded, but what my power might else exact did believe he was indeed the Duke... ...hence his ambition growing. Dost thou hear? Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. He needs will be "Absolute Milan". (Sniffs) Now... ...me poor man, hmm... my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me incapable. Now the condition. This King of Naples... ...being an enemy of me inveterate hearkens my brother's suite, which was that he should extirpate me and mine, out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan on my brother. Alack, for pity. They hurried us aboard a bark. Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepare a rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged the very rats instinctively have quit it. Hmm. (Drums and marching footsteps) There they hoist us, to cry to th' sea that roared to us. Alack what trouble I was then to you. O... a cherubin. (Music box playing) Thou was that did preserve me. Thou didst smile, infused with a fortitude from heaven. I Pray you, sir, for still 'tis beating in my mind your reason for raising the sea- storm? Know thus far forth... by accident most strange... ...bountiful Fortune hath mine enemies brought to this shore... ...and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star. (Waves crashing) (Seagulls squawking) (indistinct chatter in the distance) Ah... Hm! - Ooh! - Mm- hm! (Laughter) All the infections that the sun sucks up from bogs, fens, flats, on Prospero fall, and make him by inch- meal a disease! (indistinct voices in the distance) Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me for bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat, perchance he will not mind me. (indistinct singing, laughter) Stephano. Stephano. What have we here? (Stephano) Ooh! A man.. or a fish? Shh, shh, shh. (Giggles) Ooh! - (Whimpers) - (Trinculo) Smells like a fish. Very ancient and fish- like smell. (Groans) Do not torment me! I'll bring my wood home faster. He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest. Open your mouth! Here's that which will give language to you! (Laughs) (Snorts) Has thou not dropp'd from Heaven? Out 0' the moon, I do assure thee! (Laughter) I'll show thee every fertile inch 0' th' island. And I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god. Come on, then, monster, stand and swear. Come, kiss, mooncalf. (Raucous laughter) A plague upon the tyrant that I serve! I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, thou wondrous man. A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder out of a poor drunkard. I prithee... ...let me bring thee where crabs grow and I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts. Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how to snare the nimble marmoset. I'll bring thee to clustering filberts and sometimes I will get thee young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me? I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking. Trinculo, the King and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here! Here, bear my bottle. (Caliban) Farewell, master! Farewell! Farewell! (Singsong) No more dams I'll make for fish, nor fetch in firing at requiring, nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish. Ban, ban, Caliban, has a new master, get a new man! Freedom, high- day! High- day, freedom! Freedom, high- day, freedom! (All) No more dams I'll make for fish, nor fetch in firing at requiring, nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish. Ban, ban, Caliban! Ban, ban, Caliban! Ban, ban, Caliban! Freedom! (I Sombre music) (Gonzalo) Had I plantation of this isle, my Lord, and were the King on 't, what would I do? (Sebastian) 'Scape being drunk for want of wine. (Gonzalo) I' the Commonwealth I would by contraries execute all things, for no kind of traffic would I admit, no name of magistrate, letters should not be known. Riches, poverty and use of service, none. Contract, succession, bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none. No use of metal corn, or wine, or oil. No occupation, all men idle, all, and women, too, but innocent and pure. (indistinct chatter) (Laughter) Shh! Shh! Shh. (Coughs) Shh! Shh! (Caliban clears throat) (Miranda) 'Honour, riches, marriage- blessing, 'long continuance and increasing, 'hourly joys be still upon you. 'Juno sings her blessing on you. 'Earth's increase, foison plenty, 'barns and garners never empty, 'vines with clustering bunches growing, 'plants with goodly burthen bowing. 'Spring comes to you at the farthest, 'in the very end of harvest.' (I Classical music) (Rattling) (Stephano) Monsieur Monster! Shh! 'Tis custom with him I' th' afternoon to sleep. (Laughter) Monsieur Monster! (Raucous laughter) (Caliban) There thou mayst brain him, having first seized his books... ...or batter his skull with a log, paunch him with a stake, shh, or cut his wezand with thy knife. (Stephano) Ooh. (Laughter) Monster! (Caliban) Shh, shh, shh. (Caliban) Remember first to possess his books, for without them he's but a sot as I am, nor hath not one spirit to command. - (Stephano) Monsieur monster! - (Caliban) Shh! Shh! (Stephano giggles) Oh, oh. Weeee! (Laughs) (Caliban) Shh! (Stephano) Oh, oh, oh. Shh! And that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter. He himself calls her a nonpareil. (Laughter) I never saw a woman, but only Sycorax my dam, and she far surpasseth Sycorax. (Guffaws) Monster! I will kill this man. And his daughter and I will be King and Queen. (Laughter) And Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot? Trinculo? (Laughter) (I Suspense music) (Thumping) (Chuckles) Work not so hard. I would the lightning had burnt up those logs. Rest you. Put it down. My father is hard at study. (Ferdinand exhales) 'Tis fresh morning when you are by. (Miranda nose laughs) (Clanking) - What is your name? - Miranda. O, my father, I have broke your hest to say so. I am in my condition a Prince, Miranda. I do think a King. The very instant that I saw you did my heart fly to your service and for your sake am I this patient log- man. Do you love me? Beyond all limit. Of what else I' th' world, do love, prize, honour you. (Chuckles) I am a fool to weep of what I am glad of. Wherefore weep you? At mine unworthiness, that dares not offer what I desire to give and much less take what I shall die to want. I am your wife... if you will marry me? My mistress, dearest. - My husband, then? - Aye, here's my hand. And mine, with my heart in't. Farewell, till half an hour hence. (Chuckles) (Door closes) Some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone and most poor matters lead to rich ends. This my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious but that the mistress which I serve quickens what's dead and makes my labours pleasures. O, she's ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed. And he's composed of harshness. (Thumping) (Caliban pants) Servant monster. The folly of this island! They say there are but five on this island. We be three of them. If the other two be brained like us the state totters. (Laughs) As I told thee before I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island. By sorcery he got this isle. From me he got it. If thy greatness will revenge it, thou shalt be Lord of it, and I'll serve thee. (Stephano) How shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to this party? Yea, yea, my Lord. I'll yield him thee asleep. Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head. (Whimpers) (Heavy footsteps) (Whispers) Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a footfall. Shh! Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd, which is not yet perform'd me. Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd, which is not yet perform'd me. Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd, which is not yet perform'd me. Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd, which is not yet perform'd me. (Clanking) (Blows whistle) (Prospero) How now, moody? Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd, which is not yet perform'd me. What is thou canst demand? My liberty. Remember I have done thee worthy service. Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv'd without grudge or grumblings. Dost thou forget the torment from which I did free thee? - No. - Thou dost. And think'st it much to tread the ooze of salt deep. To run upon the sharp wind of the north. To do me business in the veins 0' th' earth when it is baked with frost, mm? Thou think'st it much? I do not, sir. Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot the foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her? (Whispers) Hast thou forgot her? (Prospero) 'Where was she born? 'Speak. Tell me.' (Ariel) 'Sir, in Algiers.' (Prospero) 'Oh, was she so? 'I must once in a month recount 'what thou hast been, which thou forget'st. 'This dam'd witch Sycorax, for mischiefs manifold, 'and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing 'from Algiers, thou know'st, was banish'd, 'for one thing she did, they would not take her life. - 'Is not this true?' - (Ariel) 'Aye, sir.' (Prospero) 'This blue- eyed hag was hither brought with child 'and here was left by the sailors. 'Thou my slave, as thou report'st thyself, 'was then her servant. 'And for thou wast a spirit too delicate 'to act her earthy and abh0rr'd commands. 'Refusing her grand hest she did confine thee 'by help of her more potent ministers, 'and in her most unmitigable rage into a cloven pine 'within which rift, imprison'd 'thou didst painfully remain a dozen years. 'Within which space she died, 'and left thee there 'where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill- wheels strike.' - (Chuckles) - (Grunts) (Prospero) Then was this island... ...save for the son, that she did litter here, not honoured with human shape. Yes, Caliban. That Caliban whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st what torment I did find thee in. Thy groans did make wolves howl. It was a torment to lay upon the damned... ...which Sycorax could not undo again. It was mine art, when I arrived and heard thee that let thee out. I thank thee, Master. (Snap and whooshing) (Prospero) If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howled away 12 winters. (Howling and buzzing) Pardon, Master. I will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently. Do so and I will discharge thee. Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd, which is not yet perform'd me. (Floor creaking) (Shrieks) (Stephano chuckles) (Heavy breathing) Huh. Oh! (Laughter) O, ho, monster! We know what belongs to a frippery! (Chuckles) O, put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand I'll have that gown. - (Laughter) - Let alone! Let alone. Shh! Let alone and do the murder first! If he awake, from top to toe, he'll fill our skins with pinches. Monster, come put some lime upon your fingers and away with the rest! I'll have none on't. I'll have none on't. We shall lose our time! We shall lose our time! And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes with foreheads villainous low! (Hunting horns and dogs baying) (Neighing) (Whip lashing, barks) (Barking and horn blaring) (Barks) Hey, mountain, mountain. There it goes, Silver! Fury! Fury! Fury! - (Ariel barks) - (Prospero shrieks) Tyrant! - (Growls) - Let should be hunted soundly. For at this hour lies at my mercy all mine enemies. Shortly shalt all my labours cease. And thou shalt have the air at freedom. (Breathes heavily) (Chuckles) (Gonzalo) All things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavour treason, felony, sword, pike, knife, gun or need of engine would I not have, but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison, all abundance, to feed my innocent people. (Sebastian) No marrying among his subjects? (Antonio) None, man, all idle, whores and knaves. (Gonzalo) I would govern, sir, with such perfection to excel the golden age. (Alonso) Prithee no more. Thou talk is nothing to me. (Gonzalo) By your patience, needs must rest me. (Alonso) Here, I will put off any hope. He is drowned and the sea mocks our search. (Antonio) I'm glad he's so out of hope. (Sebastian) The next advantage will we take. (Antonio) Let it be tonight, for now they are oppress'd by travel. They cannot use such vigilance. (Sebastian) Tonight. (Yelps) Art thou afeard? No, monster, not I. (Sobs) Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears. Sometimes voices that if I had then waked after a long sleep will make me sleep again. And then in dreaming the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when I waked I cried to dream again. This will prove a brave kingdom where I shall have... ...my music for nothing. When Prospero is destroyed. (indistinct chatter) (I Classical music playing) (Floorboards creaking) What harmony is this? Marvellous sweet music. (Raucous chatter, laughter) (I Cheerful classical music playing) - Wooo! - (Gasps) (Spits and hisses) (Cat hisses) (Growls) (squealing) (Barks, hisses) (Snarls) (Chatter and music stop) Heavens! What were these? A living drollery! Now I will believe that there are unicorns. That in Arabia there is one tree, the phoenix throne, one phoenix at this hour reigning there. If in Naples, I should report this now. Would they believe me? (Thunderclap) You are three men of sin, whom Destiny hath caused to belch up and on this island where man doth not inhabit, you being most unfit to live, I have made mad. You fools! I and my fellows are Ministers of Fate. Your swords may as well wound the loud winds. But remember, for that's my business to you... ...that you three from Milan did supplant good Prospero for which foul deed the Powers delaying, not forgetting, have incens'd the seas and shore. Yea. All the creatures against your peace. And do pronounce by me... ...ling'ring perdition... ...worse than death in this most desolate isle. (Thunderclap) (Groans, sword clangs) (Blows) (Gasps, groans) (Yelps) (Crunches and growls) (I Sinister music) (Miranda snorts) (Thud) (Miranda) Mmm. (Ferdinand clears throat) (Prospero) If I have too austerely punish'd you, your compensation makes amends. All thy vexations were but my trials of thy love and thou hast strangely stood the test. Ariel? Ariel? Ariel? Ariel? (Ariel) What would, my master? (Chuckles) Here I am. Say, my spirit, how fares the King and his followers? All prisoners, sir. They cannot budge till your release. Your charm so strongly works them that if you now beheld them, your affections would become tender. Dost thou think so, spirit? Mine would, sir, were I human. And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling of their afflictions, and shall not myself, one of their kind, that relish all as sharply be kindlier moved than thou art? Though their high wrongs have struck to me to th' quick. (Sighs deeply) Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury do I take part. The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent. The sole drift of my purpose extend not a frown further. My charms I'll break. Their senses I'll restore and they shall be themselves. (Swirling sound) (Chuckles) (Laughter) (I Sinister music) There stand, for you are spell- stopp'd. Thy brains boil'd inside thy skulls. Most cruelly, Alonso, didst thou use me and my daughter. Thy brother... ...was a furtherer in the act. Thou art pinch'd for it now, Sebastian. Good Gonzalo. My true preserver. And loyal, sir, to him thou follow'st. Flesh and blood. You, brother mine, that entertained ambition. Expell'd remorse and nature... ...and who with Sebastian would have killed your king. I do forgive thee... unnatural though thou art. Ariel? Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves. And ye that on the sand with printless foot do chase the ebbing Neptune... ...and do fly him when he comes back. You demi- puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, whereof the ewe not bites... ...and you whose pastime is to make the midnight mushrooms that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew... ...by whose aid weak masters though ye be. I have bedimmed the noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds, and twixt the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war... ...to the dread rattling thunder have I given fire... ...and rifted Jove's stout oak with his own bolt. The strong- based promontory have I made shake and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar. Graves at my command... ...have waked their sleepers. Op'd and let 'em forth. Be my so potent art. (Fire crackling) Sweet Lord... ...you play me false. No, my dear'st love. I would not for the world. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle. And I would call it fair play. (Chuckles) (Laughs) (Prospero) Now does my project gather to a head, my charms crack not, my spirits obey and times goes upright with his carriage. How's the day? On the sixth hour, at which time you said, my Lord, our work should cease. I did say when first I raised the tempest, thou shalt have freedom to the King's ship. There shalt thou find the mariners asleep. Enforce them to this place and presently. I drink the air before me, and return or ere your pulse twice beat. (I Classical Polka music playing) (Prospero) My tricksy spirit! O, how beauteous mankind is! O, brave new world that has such people in it! (Laughs) (Music stops) (indistinct chatter) Welcome, my friends. All. İf this prove a vision of the island, one dear son shall I twice lose. She is daughter, sir, to this famous Duke of Milan. I chose her when I could not ask my father for his advice, nor thought I had one. How odd that I must ask my child forgiveness. Let's not burden our remembrances with a heaviness that's gone. (Raucous laughter) (Guffaws) - (Wolf- whistles) -(Laughs) I have been in such a pickle, since I saw you last. - (Stamps foot) - O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a cramp! You'd be king 0' the isle, sirrah? This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on. Christ. (Prospero) Go to my cell. Take with you your companions. He's as disproportion'd in his manners as in his shape. His mother was a witch that could control the moon. What a thrice- doubled ass was I to take this drunkard for a god. And to worship this dull fool! Go to! Away! (Caliban groans) In the morn I will bring you to your ship, and so to Naples, where I hope to see the nuptial of these dear belov'd solemnised. And thence retire me to Milan, where every third thought shall be my grave. I long to hear the story of your life. I'll deliver all and promise you calm seas. My Ariel, it shall be thy charge... ...and then to the elements be free! (I E.M. WELCH: "Stormy Weather") J' Don't know why J' There's no sun up in the sky J' Stormy weather J' Since my man and I ain't together J' Keeps raining all the time J' Life is bare J' Gloom and misery everywhere J' Stormy weather J' Just can't get my poor self together J' I'm weary all the time J' The time J' So weary all the time J' When he went away J' The blues walked in and met me J' If he stays away The old rocking chair will get me J' All I do is pray the Lord above will let me J' Walk in the sun once more J' I can't go on J' Everything I had is gone J' Stormy weather J' Since my man and I ain't together J' Keeps raining all the time J' Keeps raining all the time J' When he went away J' The blues walked in and met me J' If he stays away the old rocking chair will get me J' All I do is pray the Lord above will let me J' Walk in the sun once more J' I can't go on J' Everything I had is gone J' Stormy weather J' Since my man and I ain't together J' Keeps raining all the time J' Keeps raining all the time J' Keeps raining all the time J' Keeps raining all the time J' Keeps raining all the time J' (Creaking) J' Where the bee sucks, J' there suck I. J' In a cowslip's bell I lie. J' There I couch when owls do cry. J' On the bat's back I do fly. J' After summer merrily... J' ...merrily, merrily J' shall I live now. J' Under the blossom that hangs on the bough J' (Hooves clopping) (Swirling sound) (Prospero) 'Our revels now are ended. 'These our actors, 'as I foretold you 'were all spirits 'and are melted into air, into thin air. '(Sighs deeply) '(Exhales) 'And like the baseless fabric of this vision 'the cloud capp'd towers, 'the gorgeous palaces, 'the solemn temples, 'the great globe itself... '...yea, all which it inherit, 'shall dissolve 'and like this insubstantial pageant faded 'leave not a rack behind. 'We are such stuff as dreams are made on 'and our little life is rounded with a sleep.'
