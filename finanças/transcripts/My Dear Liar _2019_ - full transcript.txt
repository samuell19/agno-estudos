My name is Zhong Zhenjiang. I've known her for over a month. I'm Wu Hai, her husband. Where were you after eight o'clock last night? I was working. As a part-time chauffeur. We went to East Maple Park for a date. When we were crossing the bridge, it was really dark and the roads were slippery. I accidentally crashed into the railings. I knew they were having an affair. He came to our internet cafe a couple of times. They couldn't stop ogling each other. And then, my wife started going out at night. When it happened, I was in total shock and had no time to think about her. How should I have known that she couldn't swim? She drowned, just like that. Da Hai, how did I do? We're here. Go to the underground garage. I just got another order. They keep rushing me. Do you mind parking the car yourself? Damn, how did you drive? What were you doing? Were you dreaming? What are talking about? You hit me! You're full of shit! You want to hit me? Sir, sir. Don't get excited. What are you doing? You gonna bite me? You've been drinking, haven't you? Yes, I have. I was driving for him. Were you driving when the accident happened? My dashboard camera got it all on tape, All of it. You don't have to call officer. - Bro. - Sir, sir. 10 thousand. What do you think? 10 thousand? 400 thousand. 400 thousand? This is blackmail! Sir, 400 thousand is a little too much. What about half of that? You're just a stupid chauffeur. Who's talking to you? Get lost! Good morning, Mr. Zhong. Good morning to you too. Interested in some insurance information? Good morning, Accountant Zhong. Good morning, Accountant Zhong. - Good morning, Accountant Zhong. - Number 523. Hello, Mr. Sun How's the money coming? How long do we need to wait? We've embezzled too much. We need 7 million to break even. Use the houses as collateral. I don't have the deeds for forward delivery houses. How can I use them as collateral? I'll see what I can do this weekend. We're running out of time. I heard they launched a special investigation. Cao and Meng have already been taken away. It's just a matter of time before they come for us. Ms. Tao, where is the 3,800 air purifier? Sold. Why? You said you'd save it for me. That one is also imported. For other people, I charge 6,500. For you, 5,500 This is for Yoyo. Thanks. These are all second hand appliances. The prices drop quickly. And don't forget that I'm still waiting for your answer. Ms. Tao, I... haven't started thinking about getting remarried yet. Da Hai. - Coming. - Hurry. - Foxy Fairy present you... - Can you really finish all this? It's not even gonna be enough. - Mr. Jin has joined us here. - Foxy Fairy? You're asking me to jump rope again. - You are so bad. - Mr. Zhong, can I have my cut... How dare you mention money to me? Half off? You were helping him with the bargain. He's a father. He needs the money. How much did he pay in the end? - Not a penny. - What? We did all that for nothing? What about your big debt? Mr. Cao at my company was taken by investigators. I'll be next. You gotta think of a way to get the money. I'll work with you. They're very fast. The only way left is insurance fraud. Can you help me with it? We've been friends for over 20 years. I'm telling you, small-time extortion is ok, but insurance fraud? No way. You shouldn't have embezzled the money in the first place. Don't lecture me. You coward. You'll never make anything of yourself. Good point. I saw that. Boss, someone is stealing food. Da Hai, run. Move fast! Don't run! Stop him! I'm sorry. Damn it. Slow down. Stop! - Be careful! - Theif! - You too! - We are catching theif! Who is it? - What's wrong with you? - Move away! - Thief! Thief! - You're the man, bro. Bro, Stop. I need to go back.

As long as you pay the fine, 10 times the bill. 980. I don't have that much cash. Transfer the funds. My medicine. My medicine. Yang, did you do this to him? Not me. It was him. What kind of medicine is that? Let me have a look. He has asthma. Yang, call an ambulance. Go get some water. If he dies at my restaurant, I'm screwed. Quick! - If we were late... - Don't panic. I'm not dying. Good bye. How dare you run away? What's up, Da Hai? Lousy gear, huh? Hai. What happened to your face? Nothing. - Nobody wants to buy sausages? - No. If not, then save some power. Alright. Yoyo, "First-grade math test paper, 53 marks" Get up! You little bastard! Are you Wu Hai? Tell me the truth, how many times have you done this? - Only once. - Bullshit. You can do it this well the first time? You manage the internet cafe during the day, and work as a chauffeur at night. I never even see you. I have to sign it myself. Bullshit. I never come home? What's the most important thing about being a man? Money and power. Cars and houses. And a wife. Bullshit. The most important thing about being a man is honesty. Did you miss me today? No. You learn fast. Finish everything. All of it. Somebody hit you again? I fell. Eat more meat, it's good for your body. Inhale. Hey everyone, there's a sick person upstairs. Would you mind smoking a little less. - See? I'm over here. - Got it. Catch up. - I'm coming. - Right here. Mr. Zhong, welcome Bro, - Please. - See, Some people travel to enjoy the beautiful nature. Others... Don't touch it. I can totally understand your situation. But the contract is signed in black and white. The payment for the house, once it's made, is non-refundable. I really need the money right now. I really do. I understand, but there's nothing I can do. Listen. I have an idea for you. Close out at a low price. But you should know, buyers usually don't like apartments with altered sales records. So you can only hope for the best. Diamond Bay is located on Hainan Island. The annual average PM 2.5 levels are below 30 ug/m Endless greenery and sea shore. Raindrops and beaches. - And the freshest air to enjoy. - Da Hai. - It's... - How much is the cheapest apartment? What are you doing? Let's go. Hurry up. Sorry. So you like the apartments here? What does it matter? I don't even have money to rent an apartment, let alone buy one. If you help me with that thing we talked about, I'll give you an apartment as a gift. Sir, please wait a second. Here is a souvenir from our company. It's empty. It's fresh air from Diamond Bay. It's the same air that you just inhaled. Wait! Chauffeur. Chauffeur service. Experienced chauffeur. 12 years driving experience. Zero accidents. Sir, Chauffeur service. "Guangyu Internet Cafe" Don't be afraid, Yoyo! Uncle Zhong is here. Yoyo. Hello, Zhong. What? Relax. We're almost there. Yoyo. Come here. Come and sit down. Thank you, doctor. You should be thanking your friend outside. If he hadn't brought him to the hospital in time, your son could have died. How can he have such severe asthma at such a young age? We live at an Internet Cafe You need to move somewhere with better air quality. If things stay the same, his condition will just keep getting worse. Da Hai, What are you... What are you doing? Get up! - Bro. - What? What? I just really want to thank you. If it weren't for you, Yoyo would be dead right now. Yoyo is like my own son. How could I just let him die? You already lost your wife to lung disease. So you need to listen to the doctor, and move somewhere with better air quality. There's nothing you can do about your own life, but Yoyo's life hasn't even begun yet. Zhong, that thing we talked about, are you still gonna do it? About that... I've already come up with the perfect plan. I'll do anything you need. What do you think? The railing wasn't strong enough. The two of us, along with the motorcycle, fell into the lake all at once. I know how to swim, so I was able to swim to the bank. She kept screaming for help but I was completely in shock. The only thing I could think about was saving myself. How should I know she couldn't swim? She drowned, just like that. Da Hai, how did I do? A bit too dramatic. You try it. Last night, where were you after eight o'clock? I was working. As a part-time chauffeur. I accidentally crashed into a food stall. Zhong, why do I have to have an accident? Are you stupid? The insurance pay-out will be more than ten million. There's going to be a thorough investigation. You'll be the number one suspect. As long as you don't have a motive and have an alibi on your side, and it's recognized as a traffic accident on my side, then within 3 weeks, the money will be processed. But... finding a wife isn't going to be easy. Who do you think you're talking to? - Who's that? - Check out my new ears! Foxy Fairy. - They call them cat ears. - Let me see! Do they look like my horns? Zhong, what is she doing? - Playing games with the fans. - Don't screen capture me. And reaping the benefits. -Hello, boys -Pretty hot. - Sent me more presents. - You are responsible for? Getting married. Getting the signature. And me? - Having an affair. - You guys are so good. Creating an accident. - Perfect. - Sent me more! She's a slut who scams men out of money for a living. She deserves it. The most important thing is I already asked her. She can't swim. Press here, - Keep going. - and spray it into his throat. This way... Two or three sprays each time. Don't waste it. Let me think about it, Don't mess around. Come, let uncle teach you about Chinese culture. I will win this game. Yoyo, do you have a girlfriend? -Don't blab -No. Do what your uncle says, daddy will come pick you up in a few days. Da Hai, where are you going? Mind your own business. We'll move to Hainan before long. - Hi. - Thanks. My makeup looks good every day. Yes, I'm going to have lunch in a bit. But I'm starving right now. What about you guys? I'm eating in a western restaurant today. Foxy Fairy? Big Ben. Thank you. Guangyu Internet and Technology. Vice president, Wu Hai. You promised to help me defeat Yumi last time. You're using some other account to watch me, aren't you? I'm 23 black-eye peas short. Buy them for me. Then I'll be upgraded to be the Seville Princess of the season. Slow down. I don't understand. You watch me every day, but you don't understand? Playing dumb. - Thank you. - Can I have hot water instead? I have my period today. Don't get any ideas. I'm not. Let's order. Spaghetti. - Spicy? - Are you stupid? I told you I can't eat anything spicy. I forgot. The lobsters today are very fresh. - You're Cantonese, right? - Yes. Lobsters. Boston Baked Lobsters Scottish Brandy Steamed Oysters. Purple artichoke with foie gras and parmesan. That's so funny. I spent some time in Guangdong before. "Gok go gwok gaa jau gok go gwok gaa ge gok go" - Do you know what I said? - I don't know. Every nation has it's own national anthem. You say it. Every nation... You're cute. - What's your sign? - Cancer. - Blood type? - B - Animal sign? - Rooster. My Sun and Moon is in conjunction with your Venus, Mercury and Mars. My Sun is also in conjunction with the Ruling Planet of your House 7 It says here that there's a chance we could get married. I'm not too familiar with this. Foxy Fairy, Why did you become a cam girl? My mom died when I was little. My dad can be a bit crazy sometimes. A few years ago, he broke his legs repairing the roof. To make things worse, I lost my job at the same time, and my brother needed money for tuition. One of my girlfriends told me that I could do live streaming. It's a way to make fast money. And my dad, because of his injury, has amyotrophy. So I've always wanted to save up and get him a decent massage chair. To be honest I don't think God has ever treated me very well. If he wants to make it up to me, he should just send me an eligible bachelor. A rich, successful man and a glamorous life. I know it's not gonna happen. So in my opinion, if there's a guy, who only has 100 dollars in his pocket, but is willing to spend 99 of it on me, then he's good enough for me. That's love. You're right. I didn't make that up, I read it in the book. I like to read from time to time to improve myself. What books? If A Woman Isn't Fierce, Her Position Won't Be Secure. Elegance and Tolerance Beauty: Treasure of a Lifetime Check, please. Ok, one moment, please. 3,792. Hello, Blue Jasmine Restaurant. You want to make a reservation? For how many people? What time?

Zhong, I don't have that much money. It's not about money. It's a matter of vision. The person you've become today is the result of your poor vision. Let's get another girl. Let's go to a hotel to ask an escort out. In order to get the first one out, I had to buy her more than 100 virtual yachts and dozens of Porsches online. Now you want a different girl? Have you thought about how I feel? The key thing is she can't swim. Alright. Let's give it another try. I'm telling you guys, Marshmallow was my favourite when I was a little girl They have so many colours now. You want to die? Shut up. Get out of here. Thank you so much. What a coincidence! Damn it.

Can you help me find a hotel with good internet access? I need to do a webcast tonight. Ok... Shit. What? That goddamn landlord smashed my laptop. I should have shot him. The books say that what doesn't kill you, just makes you stronger. You make enough money doing live streaming. Why do you have to live here? I send all my money home. The other day I just did a little jump rope during a webcast. Someone reported me. I got fined 30 thousand, What the hell? Who isn't looking for loopholes? I get so angry talking about it. Which hotel are you taking me to? You're so pretty. I'd be worried about you in a hotel. How about this, if you don't mind, you can come to my place. What do you think? "Guangyu Internet Cafe" We're here. I asked you to take me to a hotel. Why am I at an internet cafe? The hotels around here are all fully booked. I own this place. Relax, you'll be safe here. I asked if you wanted to come here, but you fell asleep. I have a problem. I fall asleep every time I get in a car. I sleep even better than in my bed. Really? Bro, you look so handsome today.

I eat all kinds of weird things when I do webcasts. I damaged my stomach a long time ago. But my dad loves chilies. What you said about your family, is it all true? As true as it gets. Actually, we're a lot alike. My mom and dad both died more than a decade ago. They got sick? A flood destroyed our house and swept them away. The only family I have left is... Who? You. No, not just you. You, your dad and your bother. Three. From now on we're a family. I like what we are now. We don't have to become a family. Why are you rejecting me? I'm a sick woman. I don't want to ruin your life. Is it contagious? No, it's not contagious. I was born with a fallopian tube malformation. I can't have children. I thought it was something serious. - Don't laugh. - I'm ok with not having kids. I don't care. I just want you. You say that now. I've never told you this before. But I almost got married, twice. The two guys they both said they didn't care at the beginning. But in the end, one guy blew off the engagement all of a sudden. The other one, he was a piece of work. He had a kid with someone else. Look, they are counting down the days until we break up. I'm not like those two guys. I'm not. I'm not good enough for you.

I just want to tell you that I really don't care about having kids. Have you lost your mind? How can you just mutilate yourself like that? You don't ever want to be a father? It's not mutilation. It's a vasectomy. It's completely different. You're crazy. I changed the motherboard, but can't find the same matching case. Who asked you to do that stupid surgery? What's wrong with you? You really don't care about not having kids? There's no turning back now. I only care about you. Look at me and say it again. And I'll believe you. I'm not lying. I love you. I just had the surgery.

Don't try that with me. It's a good thing that he knows to come to us, whenever there is trouble. It's not that safe out there. A lot of kidnappings are happening. You broke it. What kind of father are you? Keep playing. - I'm going now. - Take care. Your car? You can't park it here. Drive it to the back. I patrol here every day. If I see your car here again, I'll definitely give you a ticket. Take care. Sweetheart. No! - I'm sorry. - Don't bother. I'm really sorry. European vacation? Screw the honeymoon. Get away from me!

If he did own it, he wouldn't need to be a chauffeur. You're an honest boy. My dad told me that I should always be honest. See? Even your son is better than you! What else are you keeping from me? Tell me everything today. I can handle it. Ok. The kid is mine. The car is my friend's. The cafe belongs to my boss. Where is the boss? Busy with other business. I only run it for him. Being a chauffeur is my part-time job So I can make money to buy medicine for Yoyo. Ever since I met you, Yoyo has been at his uncle's place. I wanted to wait until our relationship was more stable, for you to slowly accept him. And I truly love you - with all my heart. - You swear? I swear. I really love you. I'm not lying.

What are you doing? I was about to ask you the same thing. What were you doing? Yoyo came back. I was afraid that he would recognize you. I haven't got the signature yet. Why didn't you say anything? You said not to use cell phones. Da Hai, You only got her to write half her name. Keep it down. What do we do now? Brother, I'm all yours. I'll do whatever - you say. - Don't.

Bro, do you want me to take you to the hospital? - Dad, does it hurt? - No. - It hurts pretty bad, right? - What do you think? Five stitches. One centimetre over, and I'd be blind. Don't be mad at me I said I'm sorry. "Guangyu Internet Cafe" It's so beautiful. This used to be a dance club. It was renovated into an internet cafe. - Shut it down. - Don't. It's perfect for some music and dancing. Come on. Come on, Yoyo. Come on. My hands are dirty. Yoyo, let's go. Let's dance. Dancing will make you feel better. Turn it off when you're done. - Dad, are you done? - Bring it to second floor. - Thank you for your effort. - Almost done. Thanks. Hold on. What is it? I bought it. You bought such an expensive air purifier. - Are you out of your mind? - You're out of your mind. - Return it. - No. I bought it with the money Director Jiang returned to me. It's Yoyo's birthday present. Thanks. It's also my apology gift to you. How did you know it's his birthday today? Wi-Fi password. Here you are. - Put it over there. - Alright. - Let me make some room. - Yes, please. What are you doing? Bring it over. "First-grade math test paper, 43 marks" Reaching new lows, huh? How dare you ask her to sign it for you? - Let's go. - Get him out! - Get out of here. - Who are you looking for? Foxy Fairy. I'm her biggest fan. Mr. Jin? I'm her husband. I'm not Mr. Jin. He is Mr. Jin. What? Are you kidding me? He's a high school student. Now you know he's a student. Your wife scammed him out of 80 thousand. I didn't scam him. Mr. Jin bought me those gifts himself. He's 14 years old. I don't have the money now. I'll pay you back once I get it. Dad, please cut her some slack. Screw that. Get the money now. Get it. Such a big internet cafe. There must be money here. - Let's take everything. - Come on. - No, no... - You can't take this! - I am serious! - You can't take this from us! - Don't take anything! - Those belong to the boss! - You can't do that. - No. You can't take that. You definitely can't take that. I beg you! We're not here to steal, or rob you of anything. She owes us. The air purifier is for my kid. He's sick. - Please try to understand. - Then who understands me? Let's all calm down. - Don't get all worked up. - Who's worked up? Calm down. Don't touch my wife! Is your head ok? Just leave it. Diamond watch. 59,800 dollars. It's yours. How would I know how much it's really worth? How can we believe you? The certificate and receipt are all here. You can go verify it at the store. Put it all back. Look what happened to my internet cafe, my home and my head. Ok, I know. Look, Yoyo isn't coughing anymore. Don't shoot my head. Today it's Mr. Jin. Tomorrow will be Mr. Yin. - Is there a Mr. Tong too? - Today is Yoyo's birthday. - Is there a Mr. Tie? - I don't want to fight with you. - Who else is coming? - No one. Have some cake. - "Happy birthday to you." - "Happy birthday to you." - "Happy birthday to you." - "Happy birthday to you." Seven years old. - Come on, Yoyo, cut the cake. - Yoyo, you grow so quick. Dad, you do it. Ok. "First-grade math test paper, 43 marks" "Yue Miao Miao" What's this? Nothing. What? The last time someone wrote my name like this was in middle school. He was the most popular guy at school. Who's more handsome? Him or me? Him. Ouch! Have you noticed that the more times you write the same character, the less it looks like itself? I wrote Hai 99 times. You only wrote Miao 40 times. It means that I love you more than you love me. Much, much more. Yes. You like the apartments in Diamond Bay, right? There's no point anyway. I can't afford one. Eventually you can, 10 or 20 years from now. A long time ago, I prayed in the temple I prayed that one day I'll have a home and a child. I have them all now. You have to go with me to thank the Buddha. It's not that I don't like it here. I just think that we need to move to a nicer place for Yoyo, right? Director Jiang, today is Yoyo's birthday. Let's take a rain check. Director Jiang, nobody is watching the cafe. I have to be here. I can't go. Here's the signature. It used to be really easy to ask her out. She's turned into a loving mother and good wife now? Da Hai, you need to speed things up. Everyone take a guess now. Is this my little niece or nephew? 1, 2 3, 4 You're not upset, are you? The cyber security division wants to talk to me. Someone reported us for disseminating obscene videos. There'll be a fine. If we can't work things out, there might even be jail time. It must be Mr. Jin who did this. But we reached an agreement. Why would he do that? I'll go talk to him. Don't go. I don't want you to get hurt. It's all my fault. If I had some high ranking connections, I wouldn't need to worry about anything. But I don't. I'll go back to being a chauffeur again at night to pay the fine. If the cafe gets shut down, I wouldn't even have money to buy Yoyo medicine next month, Yoyo, what's all this? I'm having fun. - It's not funny at all. - Don't scold at him! I dressed him up. You can yell at me if you want. If you don't like me doing live streaming, just say so. I won't do it then. If you don't do it, what else can you do? The water isn't cold. - Does it hurt? - Yes. You'll be fine. It's ok. It's gonna be alright. Director Jiang, where are you? Is that Xiao Yue? Yes, I'm here. It's so hard to get you out. I have to wait until you run into trouble before you come see me. Director Jiang, the thing that we talked about yesterday on the phone... Don't worry about that yet. Those gifts you brought, I can't accept them, either. Do you know how to swim? How about you exercise with me? No, I don't know how to swim. Well, you can learn. I didn't bring a bathing suit. I did. - Director Jiang. - Come on. Let's swim first. I really can't. Why don't you go back now and we'll talk some other time. Director Jiang, why do we have to talk in the swimming pool? I have a very bad fear of water. What's so scary about water? You need to overcome your fear. I can't. Miao Miao. You have six "water" radicals in your name. It means that there is a special connection - between you and water. - Not really. Too much steam. Come on, Give me your hand. - I'm scared. - You have to trust me. I'm here. What's there to be scared of? - Just relax. - I can't do this! Come down here. You try it. Float. Let me lift you a bit. Come on. You're such a pervert. Don't act all innocent, when you're already a slut. I thought it was just swimming. Why did you touch her? I didn't do it on purpose. What? Now she doesn't like you. She definitely won't see you again. What do we do now? This road leads up to Baoding Mountain. Tell her that you're taking her to the temple to pay respects. The barrier at the corner was crashed by some big truck. Your foxy fairy likes to fall asleep in the car, right? So while she's sleeping, right here, you get out of the car to take a leak. Put the car in neutral. And the car rolls away itself. Problem solved. So you're saying... you want me to do it myself? Think about Yoyo's asthma. When a man is soft down there, his heart becomes hard. But when he's hard down there, his heart becomes soft. My heart won't get soft. How can I prove that the car rolled away and I didn't drive it. Good question. When the car is stopped, you need to walk in front of the car first then to the side of the road to pee, so that the recorder can get you on camera. And when the car is rolling away, you need to act all panicked. Running and chasing it. Your reaction needs to be real. - Ok. - You're peeing. Peeing. The car starts to roll. Not like that. It needs to be real. No. Too dramatic. Peeing. The car starts rolling. Panicking. Chasing and running. Chasing and running. You did everything you could. It's a little bit surprising Today Foxy Fairy has an announcement to make. She's a workaholic. Today is the last time I do this with you guys. I feel like the Foxy Fairy that you know has always been wearing a mask. So today I've decided to just be myself. Let you guys have a look at me without make-up. Well, I'm from Hunan. And I moved to Guangdong with my mom when I was little. I lived there for 10 years. When I first got there I couldn't speak Cantonese. They all laughed at me. And then I started listening to Cantonese songs. That's how I learned Cantonese. Later when I was a bit older I wanted to leave home. I thought that I should go to Beijing. I went through a lot back then. Got my heart broken quite a few times. So I thought I was going to end up alone. I got quite used to being on my own. Sometimes I quite liked it. Scary, right? I never thought that a girl like me would eventually find the man who would take off her mask and let her be who she really is. I will start the next chapter of my life with him. And I want to tell you guys a secret. I keep saying that I'm 24 years old. That's not true. I'm 38 years old. Actually, behind this backdrop is my home. Let me show you guys. I think it's quite nice. I've liked it ever since the first time I came here. So I'll just suddenly end this webcast like that. Love you guys. I'm not Big Ben. I have a friend. He's Big Ben. He owes people a lot of money. He asked me to marry you for insurance fraud. If I don't do it, he's going to die. Yoyo's asthma keeps getting worse. There's nothing else I can do. But I just want to be with you. Why are you sitting on the floor? I'm dead. How? Lie on your stomach and move over slowly. Building No.2 of the West Block. I see it now. Who hit you? I'll avenge you. "Guangyu Internet Cafe" Hurry up. I'm going to see the Bodhisattva today. I have to look good. Don't rush me. I'll wait for you in the car. You go first. I'll be right there. He's quick. I'll be quick, too. Don't smile. - Just be cool and drive. - Ok. The rear-view mirror. Are you tired now? No. You don't want to sleep a little? No. I hate this safety belt. It ties up my soul. Let's latch onto this tour. Humans, Asura, Demons, Limbo and Six Realms. All things reincarnate through the Six Realms based on the deeds they've done. It's the saying we all know. Do not fail to do good even if it's small. Do not engage in evil even if it's small. What we see here is the deformed map of the Limbo. All the deeds can be reflected in the mirror. And be weighed on the scale. Limbo of blade mountain. Limbo of boiling pot. Limbo of the frozen. Limbo of bloodshed. Limbo of no tongue. Limbo of no tongue. If you ever lie to me, I'll rip off your tongue. This thousand-hand Bodhisattva The most valuable item here. It's the only stone-carved thousand-hand Bodhisattva in the world. Her infinite power will redeem all living. Miss, these two people aren't part of our group. Which two? Everyone else paid. - Behave yourself. - Pettiness Bodhisattva is watching you. - You didn't pay at all. - What? Can't I pay my respects? Seriously? How could she take it for granted? So shameless. She used to fall asleep all the time. But yesterday she didn't, She was too excited. You're saying... It's a sign. God doesn't want us to do this anymore. How about we forget about it? Bullshit! Acting all spooky. I've never believed in any of that. Sir, someone jumped off the building. That's Mr. Sun. 6, 5 4, 3 Time's up. Didn't you say you can't eat anything spicy? I need to go out after the rain stops. What do you want to eat? I'll bring something home. You go. I'm busy. How many did you say? Not enough. Do that again. Feel the time and nature. Touched by the beautiful and the simple. A brand new world is within Diamond Bay. Diamond Bay is located on Hainan Island. The annual average PM 2.5 levels are below 30 ug/m Every breath you take... How much is the cheapest apartment? The list price is 2.95 million. How much if I rent? Well, you can look it up yourself. How much is it? - How much if I rent? - Miss. I didn't see you here. Which type of house do you like? All of them. But I think the price is a little expensive. I happen to have a few apartments that are currently discounted. What discount? The owner is a Mr. Zhong. He works in finance. Very generous man. Why don't you write down his number? - Ok. - 156 Zhong, open the door. The insurance thing... I've made up my mind. I won't do it. I... Come in. What's that smell. Gas! Relax! - Relax! - Leave me alone. Bro, don't act stupid! Zhong! Just leave me alone! Bro, look at me. Zhong. Are you awake? Mr. Sun is dead. There's no escape for me. All the cooked books - will be held over my head. - No. -Da Hai -Bro. No. Mine. Why is she calling you? Hello, is this Mr. Zhong? What have you done? Traitor. He hung up! - Did you tell her? - No! Why did she call me Mr. Zhong? I'm Director Jiang. What the hell? Hello. Mr. Zhong? Don't hang up. I got your number from Diamond Bay. I have your number in my contacts under the name of Director Jiang. I am Director Jiang. I left a fake name with the realtors. Oh it's all making sense to me now. Here's the thing. I am Xiao Yue. I'm also looking at apartments in Diamond Bay. They say that you have apartments looking to sell. Is that right? Oh, Diamond Bay. What is it? Are the apartments for sale? How much are they? Can we talk about it later in person? Sure. - When? - 08:30 See you at the north gate of the East Maple Park. Don't hang up yet. -Sure, -Director Jiang. About last time, I shouldn't have done that. It was all my fault. I already forget about that. I'm still in a meeting. Ok, I won't keep you. See you later. You said god didn't want us to do this anymore. I don't think so. God helped us like no one else. Don't ask too many questions. Go get an alibi. This is our last chance. I have 17 apartments. Pick one. Let me wipe it off. You don't like jokes all of the sudden? For heaven's sake. You're just faking it. I know it's already healed. Let me see. Crap. I forgot to wash my hands after eating all those peppers. I'm sorry. What's the matter with you? What's the deal with all the peppers? Now you got peppers in my eyes. What if it makes Yoyo sick? I didn't mean it. I always mean well. That should be me! Why I always mean well and do so many wrongs things! I'm sorry. I know it's all my fault. Just rinse it off with some water. It's better now, right? I don't understand why you are so mad. Are you done yet? Get lost. No. Get lost! Get lost! Da Hai. Ride the new bike today. It's electric. You won't be so tired. Who asked you to spend money on this? - I didn't. - Alright. I gotta go. Tonight I need to... Whatever. It's really fast. Be careful. Director Jiang. Sorry, Director Jiang. I'm late. - You rode your scooter here? - Yes. Where are we going? The contract is at my place. It's not far from here. We need to go to your place? Don't take it the wrong way. You don't need to go upstairs. I'll go up and get it. Get on. What's that? It's a motorcycle. Come on. Don't worry about my scooter. It's very fast. That's too much trouble. We don't need two bikes. If I go on your bike, I'll have to walk back to fetch mine later. It'll only take five minutes. So close. Ok then. Let's go. I'll follow you. Xiao Yue, why are you so stubborn? For heaven's sake. Director Jiang, your apartments, is it possible to just rent one? Sure. Ok. No problem. Is it broken? No, it's not. I left in a hurry. It's not fully charged. Well, you can't push it. How about this? I'll leave the bike here for now. I'll ride yours so we don't waste any more time. Ok. What's the matter with you? What the hell? - I just hung up the lanterns. - I am not the driver. It was the chauffeur. You... It died. Sorry, Director Jiang. I've put on some weight recently. It can't make it up the slope. Don't say that. Let me push it a little. Let me. Here it comes. Go. Almost. Xiao Yue, Almost. Give it a go. Ok. Director Jiang, Don't move. Alright. I've got you. Slowly move back. Don't be nervous. -Xiao Yue, -Ok. Don't be afraid. Come on, fill it in. Check the full responsibility box. Why do you look so familiar? Haven't we met somewhere before? I don't think so. Never mind. I can't remember where. Fill out the form. Welcome to the George Barton Pepper Eating Competition. This time we've gathered 100 pepper eating experts here.

The prize for the champion is a laptop. - You don't want it? - No. We have over 50 computers at home. Why would I want another one? Guangyu Internet Cafe. Welcome everyone! It's a non-smoking internet cafe. -Wu Hai -is my husband. He's a chauffeur. It's exhausting for him riding his crappy bike all the time. So I want him to have this electric bike to make it easier for him. He must be a very good man. He's stingy about money. He only gets rid of something if he knows he can't fix it. Even on his own son's birthday, he had to go to the bakery after five o'clock. Why? He said we'd get a 30 percent discount later in the day. Wow. But he's really sweet to me. Even before we got married, he was always been very generous to me. That's my wife. He bought me a very expensive watch. - She is my wife. - If he has 100 in his pocket. He'll give 99 of it to me. And unwilling to spent last dime. I think he takes good care of me. Am I talking too much? I'm just the runner up. Go interview the winner. He's really something. Very impressive. Are you finished? I'm talking to you. Did you finish filling out the form? The officer is talking to you. What's the matter with you? I'm telling you, don't touch my car. - What is he gonna do now? - I'm counting to three. Do you know who I am? What do you mean? 1 2 Hey! Drop it. It's a hit and run. Drop it. Male, medium height, in a chauffeur uniform. Trying to escape on an electric bike. What? You don't know what an electric bike is? Don't move! Stop running! Stop! Back it up. I'm sorry. Faster Where is he? Got him. Hi, Officer. Hello. I remember who you are now. You're mistaken. I didn't give you wedding candies. Such a lousy bike rider. - You hit me. - Are you crazy? I need to go rescue someone. Rescue? I'm the policeman. I'll help you. I'll do it myself. Don't run. I really need to rescue someone. I'll help you. Why are there so many steps? Xiao Yue, slow down. I can't keep up with you. Where are you? I can't keep up with you. I'm coming. Honey, I'm here. Give me your hand. Help! I'm cramping. - Give me your hand. - Come on. Honey, come here. - Xiao Yue. - Come on! - I'm coming! - I'm cramping. Don't go back. I can't do it anymore. Xiao Yue. Don't be so tense. Relax. I can't. Honey, I'm here Da Hai. You don't need to help me. I'm alright. Don't fight. Let him go. You're a liar. You know how to swim! My glasses. My imported glasses. I'm here. Xiao Yue. What are you doing? They're imported! - All for nothing. - You are crazy! - You are quiter! - Such a coward. - You value sex over friendship. - Who thinks too small? Stop fighting! Traitor. Da Hai. Don't get this wrong. There's nothing going on between Director Jiang and me. Don't be jealous. Why did you bend my finger? It's crooked now. You even know how to dive. Don't pull my hair. Don't pull my hair. I'll help you. Stop it. Stop fighting! Stop for a second. I'm cramping again. Let me do it. Ignore him. He's a fraud. I'm really cramping. Why were you to fighting? There was no reason. Where did you learn to swim so well? There was a giant reservoir near my village. My dad always took me there to catch fish when I was little. I've always been a good swimmer. But you said you can't swim in your webcast. You don't understand. These are little tricks. If the fans knew I could swim, they'd ask me to swim during the webcast. It would ruin my makeup. I'd look too ugly. - Let me see. - No. I'm serious. Don't look at me. How did you know I was here? Come on, Look closely, is it him? - Don't touch him. - It's him. He and the other guy scammed me for 400 thousand. It's you, right? We've been following your license plate for a long time. - Take him away. - You're suspected of fraud. You need to cooperate with the investigation. It's really really hot. My husband has nothing to do with it. I didn't take a penny. -Honey, -calm down. Calm down. Believe in the law and the police force - Don't move. - Get in the car. What's going on? Dad. "First-grade math test paper, 62 marks" Good job, kid. Oh right, Director Jiang, no, Accountant Zhong, he was in a coma for over 10 days. The other day he woke up. And then? They told him that he embezzled more than 10 million and that he was sentenced more than 10 years in prison. He got so scared that he passed out again. Isn't that funny? He can't ask you to swim with him again. That's true. But I don't understand why he pretends to be Director Jiang when he sees me. Isn't it weird? Yoyo, go play outside for a bit. There's something I need to tell you. Ok. Go get a soda. What do you want to say? So mysterious. If I tell you, you probably won't ever forgive me. Zhong Zhenjiang and I we've known each other a very long time. I'm not Big Ben. He is. High definition, cloud storage and wide angle. Really good quality. What do you think? The cashier is over here. You hit me. Hey, where are you going? Mind your own business. We'll move to Hainan before long. Let me drive you. It was all my fault. Can you help me find a hotel with good internet access? I need to do a webcast tonight. Ok. I have a problem. I fall asleep every time I get in a car. And I sleep even better than in my bed. Come up here. That way. What is it? Be careful, It's very expensive. Let's go. No. Your reaction needs to be real. Don't. 33691 Vehicle owner Zhong Zhenjiang, - Embezzlement of public funds. - Diamond Bay. Foreclosure procedure. The ocean. Look, this is the ocean. Repeat after mommy, the ocean. - The ocean. - Right. Daddy is over there. Let's wave to him, ok? Come on up! It's so beautiful here. My wife and son. How old is your son? Two years old. That's when they're the cutest. He'll start to become quite a handful soon. Mr. Lee, the best thing about Diamond Bay is the fresh air here. The annual average PM 2.5 levels are the lowest in the country. I suggest you buy an apartment here for the sake of your child. It's really good for his health. My kid had asthma when he was little. He's been much better since we moved here. I can't make the decision. The decision maker is down there. I'll go get them. Ok, I'll wait for you guys here. Ok. Let's go. Let's go find daddy.
