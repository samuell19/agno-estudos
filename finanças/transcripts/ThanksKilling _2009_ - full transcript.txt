I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE, BUT HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF YOUR ANCESTORS. WELL, ANYWAYS. THE OLD INDIAN WAS SO OUTRAGED, HE VOWED HE WOULD CURSE ALL WHITE MEN. THIS WAS NO ORDINARY CURSE, HOWEVER. FEATHER CLOUD NECROMANCED A... TURKEY THAT WOULD ROAM THE EARTH EVERY 505 YEARS, KILLING THE FIRST HUMANS HE MADE CONTACT WITH. HE WAS MORE EVIL THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE -- A TURKEY THAT WOULD STOP AT NOTHING TO GET WHAT HE WANTED -- TO KILL. >> Billy: ARE YOU SHITTING ME?

I DON'T THINK SO. >> Kristen: WELL, UH, SINCE THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY TENTS, DO YOU WANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH ME, JOHNNY? >> Johnny: GEE, KRISTEN, I'D LOVE TO.

I NEVER NOTICED ANY MAGICAL TALISMAN. >> Kristen: HE PROBABLY KEEPS IT HIDDEN UNDER HIS FEATHERS. >> Darren: NO, KRISTEN, I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. LOOK -- THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS. IF THE TALISMAN IS NOT IN PLAIN VIEW, THEN IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THE TURKEY KEEPS IT IN HIS PLUMAGE. >> Johnny: GREAT. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS CATCH HIM, REMOVE HIS STUPID THINGIE, AND HE'S DEAD? >> Kristen: I THINK WE STILL HAVE TO KILL HIM.

I JUST WANT SOME FOOD. OH, HEY, SHERIFF. WHAT YOU GOT THERE? >> OH, JUST TIDYING UP. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. >> Billy: IF THAT'S THE SHERIFF, THEN YOU MUST BE TURKEY! GUYS! COME ON, COME QUICK, THE TURKEY'S HERE! >> [ LAUGHS ] YOU KIDS ARE RETARDED. >> Darren: LEAVE US ALONE! WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING US?! >> Kristen: DADDY, NO! >> SHUT UP, I DO THE TALKING, FAGGOT. A LONG TIME AGO, ONE OF YOUR ANCESTORS DISRESPECTED OUR PEOPLE REALLY, REALLY BADLY. AND SO AS PAYBACK, I'M HERE TO KILL ANY WHITE PERSON THAT DISRESPECTS INDIANS OR OUR LAND. >> Johnny: BUT WE GAVE YOUR PEOPLE LAND, AND WE LET YOU HAVE CASINOS.

NOW, DARREN, DO YOUR MAGIC. >> Darren: ALL RIGHT. >> Johnny: I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS, KRISTEN. I'M SORRY THAT WE WERE EVEN THROWN INTO THIS MESS. THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. IT'S ALL MY FAULT. >> Kristen: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS IN LIFE WE CAN'T CONTROL. AND UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS ISN'T LIKE A FOOTBALL GAME WHERE WE CAN JUST CALL AN AUDIBLE AT ANY TIME. >> Johnny: YOU'RE RIGHT. LIFE IS NOT LIKE A PLAYBOOK. I JUST GOT TO ROLL WITH IT. LIFE MOVES ON. >> Kristen: I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW, JOHNNY, THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR US. YOU CAN BE MY QUARTERBACK ANY DAY. >> Johnny: OH, KRISTEN. >> Darren: HEY, GUYS -- WHOA. HEY, GUYS, WHOA, UM, I CRACKED THE CODE. I KNOW HOW TO KILL THE TURKEY NOW. >> Kristen: SO, WHAT DOES IT SAY? WELL, BASICALLY IT TELLS ME EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW TO KILL HIM.
