Hi. Yeah, you're awake. Yeah. I have an early spin class this morning. And then an interview with some women's magazine and then lunch with Helen. Ah, send her my love. I will. Ugh, you look tired. I'll be happy when the shoot's done. Why don't I come out next week? Just for a few days. I mean, yeah, if you can that would be ama... oh, no, wait. Ah, no, next week won't work. - We're on night shoots. - Oh. And the week after that. Um. What about the 10th? Ugh. I can't. I'll be getting ready for my film. It's okay, my love. It was just an idea. Never mind. Yeah, but I do mind. How's the shoot going? It's fine. No, I mean, it's good. We're only a day behind schedule, but the studio are happy with the dailies, so. - And your star? - Alexandra? Um-hmm. She. is. good. Better than me? Oh, no. She's way better than you. And younger. Yeah. Yeah, much younger. And very, very, very boring. Oh! Well, tell me more about that. Oh, are you jealous? Desperately. Darling, I'm so sorry. I'm falling asleep here. Okay. I miss you. - I miss you, too. - I love you. I love you, too. Hello! Oh, you look well. Give me a hug. Oh, thank you. I feel well. Just did a spin class and I feel springy and taut. I could eat a horse. Good afternoon, Maggie. The usual, I suppose? Yes, please. Chopped salad, no dressing, and a pot of Earl Grey. - Thank you. - That's not a horse. That's not even a miniature Shetland pony. I'll have the club burger, rare, extra fries, and another one of those. Superb. I'll bring you something special. Thank you. I have to tell you. Cat Skills is picking up a lot of heat. Traction, whatever. All I can say is, you'd better start gearing up for award season. Time to practice that acceptance speech, even if it's only in the mirror. Gettin' my drift? Don't be ridiculous. What's ridiculous about you winning an award, darling? It's your turn. And you need one to go with Christopher's. They can be bookends. I just want to focus on Paper Scissor, which now that you've read it. Oh, Helen, come on. Lucca read it. Lucca's the intern. When do I have time to read anything longer than a menu? So for real. All this award seasons talk. You're not joking? They really like Cat Skills? The word on the grapevine is. you are a shoe-in for top spot. That's all I'm saying. Oh, I don't know. Lips are sealed. That's exciting. It's okay. I'm excited too. Bring the bottle. Darling, I am so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. I didn't want you to find out like this. I don't know what to say. The press... I... I mean, I know that's not an excuse. But Christ, Maggie, it's not you. It's not us. It just happened. Please, when you get this, will you call me? Just. call me, okay? I am so, so sorry. How long? - Uh. - Is that her? Is she there? Maggie, uh, no, no, no, uh. I'm sorry. We are both sorry. I don't care how sorry she is. How long? Um. uh, not long. How long? I don't know. A couple of months. Um, come... coming up on a year, maybe. Ugh. Maggie, it wasn't meant to happen like this. Ugh, I bet it wasn't. No, the press, I... I don't know how they knew. Do you love her? No. It's... it's complicated. It's not that hard of a question. She's pregnant. Um. Maggie, I'm so... Why? Hello? Mags? Oh, Fee. Mags, are you okay? I just saw the news. Is it true? He says he loves her and. she's pregnant. Right. So. Mags, there's a flight leaving Gatwick for St. Kitts this afternoon. I can't, Fee. I have to start a movie in Cape Town in a month. It's not up for discussion, Mags. You get on that plane. And you come to Nevis, and you let me take care of you. You let the island take care of you. You'll spend two weeks here, sleeping, swimming and doing whatever it is that you need to heal. Okay. Ah, good. Good, because I already bought the ticket. So, Mags, go pack. Yeah. I'll text you the flight details and next time you see me, you'll be in Nevis. Okay? Yeah. Maggie. Have you talked to your husband, Maggie? Have you spoken to Chris? Is there no going back? Will you go away! Get out of my way! Get that out of my face! Step away! Get out of my way! You should all be ashamed of yourselves! Come here. Baby, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh. No tears now, okay? I just can't stop crying all the time. Baby, I'm so sorry. We'll take care of you here, okay? We've got you, okay? Check this out. What do you say, huh? It's beautiful. And you know what? You never get used to it. Right, shall we? Why haven't I come to visit sooner? 'Cause you didn't need to. Oh, and that's Sam, our renowned chef. Renowned. This way. Welcome. .to your home away from home. It's beautiful. Gonna be all right, Mags. I promise. This is what happens to other people. not us. And somehow, I feel ashamed. Did you have any inkling? Nothing. Nothing at all. I mean, I knew he was having a tough shoot and that. he was tired. Now I know why. Um-hmm. I know when it started. It's when he went to LA. to see her for the movie. What's wrong with me, Fee? Nothing. Nothing's wrong with you. And you knew where I was a year ago? I was in a clinic at Palm Springs. Getting an eyelift, and a, and a skin rejuvenation. Why? You're perfect. Why? It was Christopher's idea. That's devious. And you know, then it hit me that while I was worrying about trying to look my age, he was off with some bimbo, getting it on who was half my age. Ugh. You know what? I hate women who hurt other women. Like, why? What's so hard about "he's married?" "She's married." Like what's... what's difficult? And now she's having his baby? Yeah. I mean, I never asked. Did you want children? I just assumed you guys were too busy with work. But I wanted children. Desperately. And Christopher didn't. He was terrified of becoming a parent. Well, he's in for a rude awakening. He's about to find out just how loud the pitter-patter of small, tiny feet can be. He deserves every sleepless night and every full diaper. In fact, I hope he gets triplets. Okay, listen. You're my number one priority. I have canceled everything and everyone for the next two weeks. Screw the other guests. Okay? But for right now, I want you to get a good night's sleep. In fact, take as many days as you need. Okay? So, I'll check in on you, but I won't intrude. Unless I get bored and then I'll come and poke you awake. Yeah. Then I'm gonna leave you to it. I love you, Mags. I love you. Hey. Hi. I thought you'd like some company after that long hibernation. I'd like some company. All right. I was so bored. I was sitting there willing you to wake up. And here you are. How long was I sleeping for? Two and a half, maybe three days. Wow. You hungry? You know, at some point I had some papaya. It was really good. Yeah. But that's not enough. You need feeding. You need sustenance. You say that as if I'm a 12-year-old or someone who's really ill. You're recovering from a broken heart. People used to die from those in the old days. For real. So, why don't I ask Sam to prepare a tray for you? Right. Sam, the chef. The guy who likes to take a dip at dawn. Yeah, what say you? Hmm? Are you feeling this? I mean, you know, it's okay. Go on. You can say you love it. I don't know, I think it's kind of quiet. Maybe even too quiet. Yeah. But peaceful, right? But hot. You know, just maybe even too hot. Yeah. Um-hmm. But you see, that's where the pool comes in handy. Oh. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - Good morning. - Yes. Oh my gosh. You know, if this were a movie, it would be that clich√© romantic comedy moment. Yeah. I, um, I don't watch a lot of movies. Oh. Right. You're, uh, you're Fiona's guest, right? Yes. Yes. Maggie Russell. Right. Fiona's cousin. Right. Yeah. Okay. I'm Sam. I'm... I'm sorry. - I'm, um. - Yes. Right. I'm here if you need me for anything. And you do wonderful things with vanilla. Well, I... I try my best. Yeah. Oh, and papaya. Oh my God. The way you just cubed that. I... I... I mean, I would just mess it up. D-Do you cook? No, I wouldn't call it cooking. I mainly just chuck a bunch of things into a blender. - Mostly kale. - Ah, sauce. Yeah. Uh, do you... do you want to come to the kitchen and, um, see what I do? Sure, yeah. Really? Yeah. I mean, if you want me to. Yes. Yes, please. That would be great. That'd be great. So, you take the fruit that you've cut in half. just like that. It helps when it's... when it's ripe. And then you slice off the top and the bottom. And you just very gently peel off the skin. You make it look so easy. And then with what's left, you slice it and dice it into little cubes. Why is that the best papaya ever? What did you do to it? Well, I only... I only just picked it. Are you okay? I'm sorry. Just, uh, I seem to be crying a lot at the moment. It just sort of hits me and then, and then I can't stop. It's weird because I never cry. Fiona told me what happened. I'm sorry. I've been trying to think how I would feel if I was in your situation and I think. apart from betrayal, I think I'd feel. confused. So, you do know who I am. And you know how I feel. Yeah. I think I'm gonna cry again. You came to the right place, you know. What? The hotel? No, no, no. The island. It's strong medicine. Come on. You want a go? Oh, uh, no. I'll probably just get juice all over myself. Um, I should probably go find Fiona. She'll, uh, she'll be in the dome. Okay. - Thank you. - Yeah, you bet. Hey. Hey, did you get lost? I was beginning to worry you'd fallen back asleep. Where is everyone? I thought you said it was busy. Oh, I'm sold out. Everybody does their own thing. So many places to hide around here. But they'll all be back tonight. Sam's reputation just guarantees a full restaurant every night. So lucky to have him. Yeah, you are. What is that mountain over there? Ah, not a mountain. It's a volcano. And, um, I was actually thinking of taking you hiking there one of these days when you feel stronger. When you get your mojo back. And maybe some sensible shoes. These are ridiculous, aren't they? No. They are ridiculously gorgeous. I'm just jealous 'cause you're always good in high heels. Me? Anything over an inch and I go all wobbly. Listen, um, I wanna strike a happy balance between, you know, showing you the island, taking you out of yourself, and letting you rest and recover. So, will you let me know if I'm doing too much or not enough? You did not deserve this. It's not your fault. Okay? Please don't cry. Please don't. I can't take it, you know. You want some tea? Yeah. I sound like my mom. Tea. Thank you. Hi. Just passing through. Hi. Hi. Hi. Sorry, I just wanted to stop by and say thank you for these. Well, it's a pleasure. They look great on you. Thanks. Oh God, it smells so good in here. Smells like my childhood. You know, I used to help make bread when I was a kid. - Really? - Yeah. Where was that? Ah, in Provence. My family actually had a holiday home there. Wow. Where are you from? Montana. - Montana? - Yep. Wow. How did you end up here? Well, I was young, younger. Um, and I wanted to see the world. And I came out here with a friend and I. I never left. I can see how that happens. Do you ever go back? To Provence? Oh, uh, no. My parents died when I was 12. And, uh, the house got sold and. yeah, there's nothing left. Except you. I mean, you're still here. Yeah. Do you want a go? Uh, yeah. - Yes? Okay, okay. - Sure. Why not. Just grab that right there. - Okay. - Turn it out. Gosh, it's been a minute. - There you go. - Ooh. I was taught to be firm but gentle. Oh, and what about the bread? - So. - Right, the flour. Use the palm of your hands. Okay. Just massage it like that. Right. There you go. When do I get to throw it? - You can throw it right now. - Really? Whatever it feels right. Yeah. Just. There it is. Appreciate that. You have... you have a little... just right... right here. Just like... there you go. There you go. Just. - Sorry. - I deserved that. No, I deserved that. That's... That's... I deserved that. That guy's waving at you. Ugh. Ignore him. Don't worry about him. You got some flour on your face. And something in your hair. I'm assuming it's flour and that you haven't picked up some nasty Hollywood cocaine habit. Maybe I should. At least I'd get my lying, cheating, cradle-robbing bastard, so obviously, midlife-crisis-laughingstock of a husband's attention. Nope, we're not gonna go down that route. You hear me? We'll have none of that. I'm gonna go off the rails and become a mess so I can win him back. Nonsense. No. We're gonna go quite the contrary. We're gonna go stronger without him. You understand? I just don't know if I can. Of course you can. Look at me. I didn't even have my own bank account when Jack left me. I didn't even know how to drive. And now. look at me now. Huh? Now I know what it's like to have created something of my own. And, you know, that is so satisfying. And so liberating. I know I need to pick myself up and dust myself off. And I will, you know. In time. It's just... I'm just hurting so much, FeeFee. I know. I'm just really hurting. I know. I'm sorry. Look. Look at that view, Mags. And tell me the world is not a wondrous place and life worth living. Truly. Hm. - Mm? - Oh. Your drinks. Thank you. Well, that is what your dad would call ambrosial. - Right! - Uh-huh. I'd forgotten about that. So what's in it other than rum and an umbrella? It goes like this. One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak. Okay. Okay. Dark rum, passionfruit, lemon, secret ingredient, soda, angostura bitter, and nutmeg. Well, I demand to know what the secret ingredient is. Oh, come on. It wouldn't be secret otherwise. And it's the nutmeg that matters. Oh, really? Why? 'Cause it's an aphrodisiac. Oh, well, excuse me. Look at you and your aphrodisiacs. What are you hiding? Nothing. - Uh, nothing? - Yeah, nothing. You have a man, don't you? I know you much too well. It was the guy in the fishing boat, wasn't it? The one who was waving at you. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come on. Tell me. Tell me. Oh, it's kinda nice. - Oh? - Yeah. Of course you would say that. I forgot how good you are at netball. What? Do you want another? No, I think this is enough. Let that melt right here, okay? Hm, hm, hm. Are you gonna tell me now? Are you gonna tell me what his name is? Do you want another one? - Are you done? - Don't change the sub... don't change the subject. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Look at this. And did you... do you make this? You always... she's always trying to get the aphrodisiac. What do you think? Do you think it fits? Hmm. Too big? Yeah. What about this? - Perfect. - Yeah? Oh, look, we'll go diving for these, okay? - Yes. They're amazing. - Um-hmm. - Hi. - Oh, hey. - Nice to see you. - You too. - Um. - Uh, I... I'm just shopping for dinner. - Did you find anything? - Oh, of course. Uh, I found this hat. - Oh, it suits you. - What do you think? - I like that. - Thank you. Where you off to next? You... you wanna join me? Sure. I mean, that would be great. You're gonna love this. Hi, Sylvia. How are you? Look at these. Wow. tilapia, red snapper. Beautiful. Yum. Singing fish? Singing. Uh, both of these, please. - I'll be right back. - Okay. I'm just gonna grab something. What kind of fish is this? This one's a snapper. Hey, it's Maggie. Maggie, Maggie. Can we get a selfie, please? Uh, you know. Please. Just... just one. - Just one, please. - Um. Fine. Darlin', I'm so sorry. I thought I lost you. Sorry. Let's go. Come on. I don't know how you put up with that. That's nothing. Von. - Hey. - How are you, man? - Uh, the usual, please. - Sure. What's... what's the usual? Um. you're gonna love these. Oh, my God, what is this? - Try it. - Okay. - Oooh, it's hot. - Yeah. Just blow on it. Oh, so fresh. Mm. - You're terrible. - I thought you might like it. - I might have to have another. - You can have another. - You want some? - Uh, yup. Ah, it's really, it's really hot. It's really hot. - You weren't kiddin'. - Yeah. Oh, my goodness. - But delicious, right? - Amazing. Oh, I feel terrible. Oh, yeah. That might be a little too much of a good thing, I think. Thank you. Sam, don't you want to sit in the front? - There's more leg room. - No, no. I'm okay. I feel safer back here. Cheek. So, what's for dinner tonight? Uh, it's a surprise. Ugh, I hate surprises. No, no. You'll like this one. Hey, I was thinking. What about dinner, just you and me together tonight? I would love that. Well, in that case, I'd love that too. Here we go. Hold on. Okay, man. Chill. What am I doing? Good evening, chef. Oh, hi there. Knock, knock. Oh. Wow. You dressed up. This old thing? If you say so. These are some of my people. Yeah. That's from your parents' wedding. I haven't seen this one before. Are you hungry? Here we go. Thank you. And cheers. Cheers. Ooh. It's got a kick to it. Can barely feel my toes. Okay. It's the juice from a habanero chili. Sam thinks nobody knows. But we all do, so don't tell him. Here he comes. All right, I hope you're hungry. I could eat a horse. Local operatic fish, line-caught this morning, grilled over wild herbs, and tossed with ransoms and cilantro from the garden, and dressed with a vanilla-infused, locally sourced olive oil from the bucida spinoza olives that are native to these islands. The, uh, fish comes from where we were this morning. - Yeah. - Out in the water, past the rocks and just to the left. So, the fish from the market. That's right. Oh, my singing fish. They're still happy to see you. And they'll taste sweet because they're local and they're fresh. And, um. I haven't done anything to them so they can speak and sing for themselves. Thank you. It looks wonderful. Uh. Can I get you anything else? No. So can you please go so we can talk about you. Enjoy. Thank you. He's lovely, isn't he? He is, yeah. I do worry about him, though. Why? I think he gets lonely. And raising Daniel all by himself. Who's Daniel? Daniel is his son. Oh. How old? Three? No, four. Four. And does Daniel have a mom? She left them. She went to the States. Nobody knows where. And just never came back. God, that's terrible. It must've been so hard. Makes me think that you two have stuff in common. Why? Because we've both been abandoned? Well, it's more like you're both lonely people. I'm not lonely. I mean. I just see two wonderful people who've made a genuine connection. Please. It's probably his thing. You know, all these lonely, sad women who come on holiday and in comes gorgeous Sam with his rum punch and just sweeps them off their feet. He's just not that guy. Oh, well, well, well. Hello there. Maggie, this is Victor. My lawyer and my friend. I didn't know you had company. I told you my cousin was coming to stay. And you were waving at us the other day. - Yes. - And you ignored me. I've been phoning you, left numerous messages, all ignored. I sent you flowers. Don't be needy. It's not like you at all. Come on, have a seat. Join us. As you can see, Five. The what? I was beginning to think that this cousin of hers was a guy. And I was going to have to get jealous. No, I'm a girl. Maggie. Nice to meet you. Hello, Maggie. And I am a ridiculously famous movie star whose life is falling apart. And the only way to get better is to come here and be with my fabulous, wonderful cousin and closest friend on this idyllic island. I see. Do you like to join us for some singing fish? Maggie, I like you already and yes, I will have some of that singing fish. Here. Great. Then we can talk about your friendship with my cousin. I'd love that. Do you have an accent, by the way? Where are you from? Saint Martin. French Caribbean. Oo-la-la. I mean, we nearly ran out of fish. I know. And then this is what Jessica was asking for, the mahi-mahi. - Again. - Again. - Hey. - Hey. Where are you two off to all cloak-and-dagger? We're, uh, we're going night-crabbing. - Oh. - Wanna come? Is that like nightclubbing, but not? I told you she has sense of humor. You were so right. How big are the crabs? Well, like. like this. Not... not... Oh. You know what? Good night, boys. Have fun. No Me? Good night, Sam. Good night. - Stop. - What? You keep looking at me. You keep being there. You're such a flirt. As promised. fresh rolls. - Hot. - Oh my God. You're a genius. Look at those. Oh my God, Sam. Mm. Good morning. - Morning. - Hi. A little boy dropped these off. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? Uh, I... I just might. Yes. He's adorable. The apple does fall far from the tree. Oh, you do have a sense of humor. May I get you a cup of coffee? Sure. Sit down. Victor. All right. - I must be going. - Oh, okay. I've gotta go home and change. Yeah. And drop the keys to the farm. Oh, is that the house on the hill? The one for sale? It is. Why? Are you interested? Victor. I'll find you later. Okay? I'm stealing her away for the day. But she's a willing hostage. Huh, a touch of Stockholm syndrome? Something like that. I'm... I'm sorry. I really... I'm sorry. I thought we were climbing to the top of that mountain today. I have some making up to do. You understand, right? You gonna be okay by yourself? Yeah, I'll be fine. Uh, you could. you could always come with me. I have to head up to the vegetable garden this afternoon. Could always use an undergardener. A... a what? An... an undergardener? I... I mean, how could I resist? Great. So how serious are things between you and Victor? He's a good guy, Mags. And they're hard to find. So when you do find them, you have to hold on to them. I will probably not be back tonight. So don't worry. I'm in excellent hands. You are terrible. I'm happy, Mags. And I'm alive. And I don't want to hear anything about any garden-related accidents. You understand? Oh, please. Hi. Hello, Victor. Madam. Have fun. You know we will. I, uh, hope you're ready for a hard day's work. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, it's fertile here. More fertile than my patch at Golden Rock. Victor negotiated the rental on this plot for Fiona. And this house is for sale? Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, it's been empty for ages. Let me get the tools. Oh. My, uh, home away from home. It's wonderful. It's great, isn't it? Here. - What is it? - Have a smell. Oh. vanilla. Vanilla pompona, to be exact. Also known as West Indian vanilla. It's a... it's a type of orchid. The Aztecs cultivated it and the conquistadors called it vanilla, which means "little pod." They took it back to Europe at the same time they introduced cacao. It's hugely labor-intensive, which is why it's so precious. You have to pollinate it by hand in a method discovered by a 12-year-old slave named Albius in the 19th century. And, uh, it's not just used in flavoring. It's also in cosmetics and perfumes, and it's in medicine. Not just homeopathic medicine, it's... has antiseptic properties. It's antispasmodic. Helps you sleep, wakes you up. Its scent tricks you into thinking you've eaten chocolate and makes you happy. That's why you're always smiling. Probably. You really love it. Yeah, I really do. There's something you're not telling me. Am I really that transparent? Just tell me. Okay. And I haven't told anybody this. One day. I'm gonna open a vanilla farm right here on the island. I mean, it's perfectly suited to it. It's the right loamy soil, the sun, a little bit of shade, the slope, it's... it's perfect. It's crazy, right? That sounds crazy. No, it sounds wonderful. You should do it. Absolutely. I mean, it's your passion, Sam. I mean, we should always do what we're passionate about. Well, there is one... one other thing that I'm passionate about. You never told me you could sail. You never asked. Ugh. I love it. I always forget it's my happy place until I'm in it. Tighten up the sheet, Skipper. Aye-aye, Captain. ‚ô™ Lord knows Lord knows This reminds me of high school. Where's Daniel tonight? He's, uh, he's at a sleepover. Oh, so you planned this, huh? You know, "planned" sounds kinda creepy. Uh, but... but hoped, definitely. Yeah, definitely hoped. - That was wonderful. - Yeah. It was perfect. It was perfect. Um, I. have to go to work. I know. - Thank you. - Yeah. Thank you. Did you sleep well, Margaret? Oh, wonderfully, Fiona. It must have been a nice sleep-in, yeah? Lazy morning in bed? Oh, yes, it was bliss. Yeah. Uh-huh. No disturbances? No, none. So how come I've been banging on your door for the past two hours? One hour. Fine, 10 minutes. I guess I'm just a sound sleeper. Uh-huh. Slut. Okay, come on. I want all the details. No. There's nothing to tell. Okay. Well, I'm gonna take you on a walk then. Nice try. I'm not talking. You'll talk. Now you know what it feels like. God, the beauty of this island, it just hits you again and again. Are you feeling better? You sound better. Yeah, I am. It's the island doing its work. And maybe Sam has a little to do with it. Yes, he does. - Uh-huh. - And you. And Nevis. Oh, I just feel like I'm finally finding myself, you know? Um-hmm. I feel like I could stay here. Maybe even live here. So. what's stopping you? Work. Living here wouldn't stop that. No, I guess you're right. and keep this as a home base. Would you miss London? No, not at all. Deep down inside, Just never had the time to go. Do you miss Christopher? You know, when I first got here, I felt that panicky feeling of, how am I ever gonna cope? Um-hmm. That's gone now. And I feel so much stronger. All thanks to you. It's such a joy having you here. I wish you could stay here forever. I love you, Fee. And I love you. Right. So. this afternoon, I was thinking we'd go and do some shopping therapy. Actually, I've already made plans with Sam and Daniel. Tomorrow? Of course. As long as you're happy. That's all I care about. I am, Fiona. I'm really happy. Okay, I want to welcome you to the Swim Academy. And children, it's very important that you listen to the instructors, okay? - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay. Everybody ready to have some fun? Me! Okay! Let's go! Hey, kiddo, it's okay. I was nervous the first time too. But you know Terry's there and the parents, and your dad and me. we're all here. You're gonna be safe. It really is. Hey, I know you... I know you're worried about getting splashed in the face. But you splash me all the time, right? All the time. Are you ready? Are you ready? Do you want one of us to take you down? Do you wanna go with Maggie? Come on, come on. Be brave. Oh! Oh, I see. I see how it is. Oh, all right. Let's do it. All right, have fun, big guy. What about that? Any... any day that I'm not gonna. You want to bury your feet? You want to bury one of my feet? Thank you. Oh, my goodness! Well now, what am I gonna do? I've got no feet left. I'll bury yours too. We're gonna be feet monsters when we come out. We'll be full of sand! That's silly, I know. But we'll go in the water and we'll wash it all off. And it'll just disappear into the ocean. And all the fishes will wiggle in the sand. Ready to pull them out? One, two, three. Oh! Look at all that sand. It's all over the place. Now, can I have my hat back, Mister? Yeah. Thank you. All right. You ready for this? You wanna get in the water? - Yeah. - Okay, let's do it. - Yay! Come on, boy. - Yay! You did great. High five. - All right! - Come on, come on. You're so strong. Nice grip. - Yay! - Come on, let's go hop back in the car. Okay. Go, go, go. You are brilliant with him, you know. Well, he's a good kid. I know. I'm lucky. With his mother leaving, it's hard on a little kid. He asks about her sometimes. You haven't talked about it? She... she was a mess. I hoped she would stop being a mess. But she didn't. and then she left. That must have been devastating. I should've seen it comin'. The thing is. she left me Daniel. And I see it as a privilege that I get to raise him, spend so much time with him. Because a lot of dads don't get to do that, so. So yeah. I think I'm the one that's lucky. I think Daniel's pretty lucky too. Come here, big guy. Come here. You were great today. Hey, I'll meet you up in the kitchen, pal. Bye, Maggie. Bye. Oh, my gosh, how was he not exhausted? I am whupped. Yeah. Um, do you think that we could see each other later? Yeah, I think. I think we can make that happen. Oh. Okay. Christopher. What are you doing here? How did you find me? Wasn't hard to figure out. Fiona is the only person you're ever gonna go to. I have a plane booked to take us back to London tomorrow morning. You can't just show up here like this. Maggie, we're married. Okay? You don't just walk away from 10 years of marriage just because... I... I made a mistake. And I'm so sorry. Please, let's just go home and we can talk about it. What you doin'? I'm leaving. I can see that. Christopher's here. He wants me to come home. So I'm going. Why? Because. I can't just leave everything behind, you know? He's my husband. I can't just walk away from that. At least without talking about it. Can you trust him again? I don't know. Just know that I'm right here for you. And, um, I love you. I love you too. - Maggie, I... - No, wait. Let me speak, please. You're the most extraordinary person I have ever met. And I was not expecting to have all of these feelings. Which makes it all the more complicated. 'Cause I feel frightened and conflicted and excited and... and angry and sad and happy all at the same time. My head is... is... is a complete mess. But I can't just walk away from my old life. Our actions have consequences. And I have to go back and talk to my husband. I know. I understand that. I'm sorry that I wasn't strong enough. to not complicate your life even more. The fact is you made. you made me feel something that I have never felt before. Give Daniel a hug for me, okay? Are you sure? Look, even the island doesn't want you to leave. It's crying. I have to go, Fee. I'm gonna miss you. Me too. We're here, okay? Come on, get out of the way, guys. Give the lady some room. Maggie, Maggie. Have you got a comment? Maggie. Please, please, please. Get off my property! Back off! Back off! Um, kettle just boiled. Um, do you want tea? What are you having? Chamomile. Why'd you come back, Christopher? No more lies, no more excuses. Just the truth. When we spoke on the phone, everything was just crazy. Okay? I was in the middle of a shoot, the whole Alexandra pregnancy thing, it just. I made a mistake. But that's done now, and I'm thinking clearly. And Maggie, I love you. Okay? I don't want to have a baby. What am I gonna do with a kid? I want this, us, the life that we've created together, making films, because it works. And you know, the Alex thing, in a way I don't regret it because it made me realize what we have is so special. I'm sorry, let me get this straight. You run off with another woman, who is now having your child, and you want us to pretend like we can just go back to normal? Like I should be flattered that it took all of this for you to realize that what we had was special? Maggie... No, Christopher. This is done. Don't do this to us. To us? Where was "us" when you were having an affair? There hasn't been an us for as long as I can remember. There wasn't even an us at our wedding. It has always been about you. And if I've learned anything in the past few days, it's that I am stronger without you. I don't want to be the leading lady in your story anymore. I'm gonna be the hero in my own. So what are you saying? I'm saying this is over. Our marriage has reached its third act. And I'm not hanging around. Billy Wilder. Yeah. At least he knew how to make a movie. Darling. Oh. Helen. Maggie! Aren't you a sight to behold. Why thank you. What can I get you? Chopped salad, no dressing? No, I think I'll have whatever is fresh and local. Let the chef decide. And a large glass of Sancerre, please. I'll have the Merlot, darling. I'm gonna have to send all my clients to the Caribbean on a jolly if this is how they come back. Hmm. So? How's Christopher when he's not punching journalists? He didn't punch them. But you really want to know how Christopher is? He's pathetic. I know a four-year-old with more backbone than him. So, you left him? Yeah. Thank you. That's it. Getting a divorce. It's over. New life. New Maggie. Good girl. Hmm. And. I'm not doing it. Doing what? The next movie. I just want to concentrate on Paper Scissors. You know, I want to focus on something else. I've been acting for the past 20 years and. when I wrote this script, I didn't know what the story was or where it was going. Or anything about the lead character. But now I know. You deserve some happiness, darling girl. You've phoned me every day since I represented you, and in the last ten days you've phoned me twice; once to tell me you were going away, and then again to tell me you were coming back. The gap in between speaks volumes. There is something different about you. Let's toast to that. Cheers. - Goodbye, darling. - Oh, bye. - Be safe. - Okay. Yeah, bye. Hey, bud. Come on. Right, don't go too far, okay? Okay. Don't even think about stealing that water. This is private property, you know. You'll find the water belongs to Nevis. Come on. Let's go get Daniel. Still have a lot of vanilla vines to plant, you know.
