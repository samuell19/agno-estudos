Fuck. What the fuck? What the...? What the fuck? What the...? What the fuck! Fuck. Hello? Fuck. Hello, Seth. I wanna play a game. Right now, you're feeling helpless. This is the same helplessness... ...you've bestowed onto others. But now it's onto you. Some call this karma. I call it justice. Now, you served five years... ...of what should have been a life sentence for murder. A technicality gave you freedom... ...but it inhibited you from understanding... ...the impact of taking a life. Today, I offer you true freedom. In 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop far enough to touch your body. Within sixty seconds it will cut you in half. To avoid the pendulum... ...all you have to do is destroy the things that have killed. Your hands. You must insert your hands and push the buttons... ...to start the devices before you. Your bones will be crushed to dust. Will you destroy the things that have taken life in order to save one, Seth? Make your choice. No. It was an accident! Please. Okay. Fuck you. Okay. Okay. Okay. I did what I was supposed to do. Let me see your hands. Let me see your fucking hands. Where is my daughter? You... Jesus. Hello, Agent Strahm. If you're hearing this... ...then you've finally found what you've been looking for. But is the discovery of my body enough? Or will your insatiable hunger to uncover the truth... ...push you deeper into the abyss? Heed my warning: Do not proceed. For this room can either be your sanctuary or it can be your grave. The choice is yours. Fuck you. Hey! Help! Help! Help! Help! Go! Go! You're okay. - Where's my dad? - He's gonna be okay. Where's my mom? Where's my mom? - Hoffman. - I got it. I got it. You okay to walk? What the hell, man? What happened? Where's Rigg? Tried to help. He didn't make it. Nobody made it. We got a live one. Hello? Right away. Ms. Tuck. Have a seat. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman. Why am I here? I represent your ex-husband, John. In the event of his death, I was instructed to contact you. You can understand my surprise when I found out who he really was. John left something for you. If you're watching this, Jill, I'm long gone from this world. You are my heart, you always have been. You always will be. I'm not going to try to explain my actions of late. Suffice it to say that I find it difficult to forgive myself... ...for what happened at the clinic. I permitted, indeed, encouraged your decisions regarding the people there. I saw danger and I... I should have acted sooner. I'm leaving you a box today, and its contents are of grave importance. Even though you and I don't always see eye to eye on everything... ...I deeply believe in you and I believe that you will know... ...what to do with these materials. I wanna thank you all for coming here today. And I'd like to be the first to say... ...that the Jigsaw murders are over. The officers who gave their lives are being honored here today. But today I'd like to offer a special honor... ...to the detective who's been on this case right from the beginning... ...who proved through hard work and dedication... ...that the people who died did not die in vain. Today we honor the newly promoted Detective Lieutenant... ...Mark Hoffman. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Throughout this ordeal, if we've learned anything it's that... ...human life is sacred. And we've learned that every day... ...life should be cherished. Justice... ...is the backbone to every peaceful society. And I believe that true justice has been served. Detective Hoffman, you're wanted at the hospital. It's about Agent Perez. Thank you. Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome to the world that you have long studied. Heed my warning, Agent Perez. Your next move is critical. - Open the door. - What is that? I got you. I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez. She said your name, you know. The last thing she said was "Detective Hoffman." Why'd she say that? Why'd she say your name? - I don't know. - No? How'd you walk out of that building? How did you? On a gurney with a fucking hole in my throat. Look at you. Couple of scratches and a story about how your arm straps broke. Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes. Is this you theorizing again? Because Jigsaw's dead. I'm not talking about him... ...I'm talking about you and your whole crooked department. My department's gone. They're all dead. There's no one left. Besides you. Been chasing Jigsaw from the beginning... ...and I got him. So unless you've got something else to say... ...back the fuck off. Read the papers. I saved that little girl. Sorry about Agent Perez. Shouldn't you be resting? I'm fine, Erickson. No, you're not, Peter. That's why I put you on medical leave. I was supposed to die in that trap. You never should have been there without backup. I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time. You're no longer handling the case, Peter. What? Read it. Over a dozen dead bodies were recovered at the scene... ...two of which were cops. Jigsaw's dead, how many lives did I inevitably save? By endangering yourself and others. You're off the case. On whose orders? Mine. I'm sorry, Peter. It's over. Oh, my God. - What is this? - Hey, don't move. What did you do to me? I didn't do anything. - It's Jigsaw. - What? I knew this was gonna happen to me. This is what he does. No, it's not Jigsaw. He's dead. Haven't you watched TV lately? Yeah, well, whoever it is... ...they're watching us. To make sure we follow the rules. - Which are what? - I wouldn't do that if I were you. Unless you want your head to pop off like a dandelion. - How do you know that? - Because I have eyes. One pull-pin starts the timer for all of us. You won't wanna do that unless you know how it works, now, would you? You're starting to freak me out, dude. Hello, and welcome. From birth, you've all been given the advantages of few others. Yet through poor moral decisions... ...you've used these advantages to selfishly further... ...only yourselves at the expense of others. Well, today this singular way of thinking will be put to the test. Today, five will become one, with a common goal of survival. You are all connected. A cable runs through your collar devices. It can be pulled so tight... ...that you will be decapitated on the mounted razors. The only way to remove the collar is with the keys from the glass boxes... ...on the pedestals before you. However, if one of you moves to retrieve a key... ...the 60-second timer will begin for you all. In choosing how to react to this situation... ...your lifelong instincts will tell you to do one thing... ...but I implore you to do the opposite. Let the games begin. Somebody has to die. No, no, no, it says, "Don't listen to your instincts." - That means don't go for the keys. - You fucking nuts? How are we supposed to live if we don't? - It's testing our endurance. - We gotta move, babe. That timer's connected to those jars. It didn't say anything about those jars. - They could be nothing. - They're nail bombs. Homemade, probably C-4. How the fuck do you know that? She's a fire inspector. She's seen all kinds of demented shit. How do you know me? Hey, man, she's asking you a question. How do you know her? How do you know her? Answer me! Look, let's just keep our cool. - Okay, we can figure this out. - We're all here for a reason. Okay, and we're all connected, as the message said. We just need to... - What did you do? - You go first. It said that we were all born with advantages. Right? That means we're all from money. - I'm not. - And neither am I. Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew. Well, then, what does it mean? We did something wrong with an advantage from birth. - That doesn't have to mean money. - What are you not telling us? You know about her, what do you know about the rest of us? Would you fucking talk to me? - Relax. - I am fucking relaxed. It's a game, tweaker. Get it? The less you know about me, the better. The reason why you fucked up your charmed existence... ...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it? Fuck you. Fuck you. Been playing with matches again, have we? Fuck all of you and your fucking plan. Unless you wanna be shredded when those bombs go off... ...l suggest we move on. What are you doing? Being smart. Special Agent Strahm's office. This is Detective Hoffman. Is Agent Strahm available? He's not, but I can connect you to Special Agent Erickson. He's handling all inquiries. Please. You've reached the voice mail box of Agent Erickson. Please leave a message. Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman. I needed to discuss something with Agent Strahm... ...but I can't seem to track him down. Could you give me a call? It would be greatly appreciated. There you are. Sister. Peter. - Cowan, take this to analysis. - Right away, sir. What are you doing here? Just grabbing some stuff from the office. I'm taking your advice. - Taking some time off, huh? - Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know. You know, I'll keep in touch. I'll see you around. Hoffman. We got another body. Looks like another Jigsaw victim. - You up for this? - Yeah. Typical bio. Murder convict. Served five years, just released last month. I know him. His name's Seth Baxter. My sister's ex-boyfriend. This is the guy that murdered your sister? He was sentenced to 25 years. Got it reduced to five on a technicality. Well, then I'd say justice was served. You killed him. Made it look like a Jigsaw trap. I got you. Not yet. Don't close the door. It'll set off the timer. - Do you know that for sure? - Educated guess. What we need to do is figure out who everyone is. Okay, well, we know that the dead woman worked for the fire department. Not anymore. She got canned a month ago. How the fuck do you...? How the fuck do you know that? You're responsible for this? She had her fucking head cut off! I'm closing the door. - I'm gonna close the fucking door! - Just be quiet. Please. What's your story? I work for the Department of City Planning. - Married? Kids? - No, and no. Your turn. You're not gonna tell them about Daddy? - My dad is Richard Gibbs. - The owner of the Cougars? He's been trying to build a new stadium for years. Little did he know... ...all he had to do is wait for his daughter to get a job in City Planning. And you. What about you? What sort of shady shit have you been up to? I'm a senior V.P. for a real estate development company. So you're boring too. The Marshvard Group. Yeah, you can't get a permit in this town... ...without going through the Department of City Planning. - Right? - No, you can't. What about you? No wife. - No kids that I know of. No job. - Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised? I'm so fucking sick of your self-righteousness. It's your turn. I'm an investigative journalist for The Herald. Herald? That's your accomplishment? You work for a gossip rag? Bite your fucking tongue. What the hell are in those jars? Let's do this fucking thing before the bombs go off. Fuck! Hello, and welcome to the next lesson. These walls hold four chambers. These chambers are for safety. However, to access them, a key is needed. But only three of the keys will fit the locks. These keys are in the glass jars hanging from the ceiling. Move quickly, though, because when the clock ticks down... ...the explosives in the corners of the room will detonate. With only three points of safety, which of you will be the odd man out? Make your choice. Fuck. Fuck, it's blank. I need a shape. Get your hands off that, you're not going anywhere. - Stop it! - Get a clue, you fucking bitch. It's survival of the fittest. Blank. Blank. Shit. I got it. Got it. Yes. Better luck next time, rich boy. Survival of the fittest, my ass! Wait. Everything all right with Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case? - Yeah. - Good. Fisk. You keep me posted. - Will do. - Good. After Seth, you were involved in every investigation. When did you first meet Jigsaw? Stop it, stop it! Don't! Heel! Heel, I said! Don't provoke him. Asshole! Jesus Christ. Come on, Peewee. Come on. - Come on, Peewee. - Peewee. Shit. Do you mind? - Going up? - Yes, thank you. What floor are you going to? I think we're both going to the same place. You know why you're here, don't you? They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But I find it somewhat distasteful... ...to be given credit for work that's not mine. Especially inferior work. Like you, I know what it's like to lose family. I know what it's like not to be able to protect loved ones. It's a powerless feeling. I wouldn't do that. Hair trigger. What do you see? Vengeance can change a person. Make you into something... ...you never thought you were capable of being. But unlike you, I've never killed anyone. - I give people a chance. - You call this a chance? We'll see. - Our game's just begun. - Our game? You don't even know me. I know you. I've followed you as you've pursued me. I know you. I know about your sister. I know how you cared for her. I know she was your only family. Leave me alone. No! You sit in bars until closing. You drink so you can sleep. You stagger to your car... ...and then you start it all over again the next day. Then I discovered what you do for recreation. You can dispense justice... ...and give people a chance to value their lives in the same moment. And by the way... ...the blade on your pendulum was inferior. If you want a true edge... ...you have to used tempered steel. Tempering's better for the long haul. You in this for the long haul, detective? I've been a cop for 20 years. Is that long enough for you? Then you and I both know the statistics for repeat offenders in this city. 67.5 percent of criminals are back in prison within three years. What do you want from me? So you might look at what you did to Seth as a kind of public service. She was my only family. He didn't deserve a chance. - He was an animal. - Everybody deserves a chance! You didn't see the blood! You didn't see what he fucking did to her! Killing is distasteful... ...to me. There is a better, more efficient way. What do you see...? Look! - What do you see? - Tell me what you want. I wanna know if you have what it takes to survive. Fuck you. Fuck you. You see, it's a different method that I'm talking about. If a subject survives my method... ...he or she is instantly rehabilitated. Now, you want a chance? You want a chance? I'll give you a chance. I'm the man you call Jigsaw. It's your duty to bring me in... ...but I know who you are... ...and I know what you've done. So this is blackmail. No, no, no. This is redemption. Just giving you an option, that's all. Now, you can arrest me... ...but doing so, your life ends as you know it. Or... ...you could explore... ...a method of rehabilitation... ...that'll permit you to sleep at night. Or I could kill you right now. But you're not a true killer. That's your dilemma... ...and the information that I have on you is exactly where it needs to be... ...and it will be released in the event of my disappearance. They'll never believe your word over mine. You willing to take that risk? Risk of ruining your own life... ...in order to protect a corrupt legal system... ...that puts murderers back on the streets? How would your sister feel? You're at a crossroads, detective. Make your choice. Did you help Jigsaw get all of them? Detective Hoffman, this is Special Agent Erickson. You had something you needed to discuss about the Jigsaw case? Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room tonight at the hospital... ...but he wasn't there. - I hope he's all right. - Oh, yeah, he's fine. Agent Strahm was theorizing about the possibility... ...of an additional accomplice to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young. Someone who might be currently unknown. Did he ever mention anything like that to you? - No, but then again, I'm new to the case. - Yeah, well... ...maybe you could get him to contact me at his earliest convenience. Will do. And... ...in your theorizing... ...who exactly did you suspect would be an accomplice? Well, he suspected someone on the inside. Someone with access. It's an interesting theory. Detective, what do you say we reconnect in the morning? You got it. Dead. That guy was an asshole, but he was smart. We could've used him. Yeah, well, someone had to die. Would you rather it'd been you? How'd they get you? Screw you! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill... Hello, Paul. Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die... ...or did you just want some attention? Tonight, you'll show me. If you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again. How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul? I didn't expect to feel any remorse. The heart cannot be involved. Emotionally, there can be nothing there. It can never be personal. - Let's go. - No. You're not done yet. Tonight you will see the difference between killing and rehabilitation. There is another detective that you should be aware of. His name's Tapp. He's smart, and he's getting closer. I know who he is. I need you to lead him to someone for me. A doctor. A healer who needs some healing. Is this yours, doctor? You supplied these police files, didn't you? You're assuming this is gonna play out the way you want it. I assume nothing. I anticipate the possibilities, and I let the game play out. Then why do you need Amanda in the game? To ensure that the rules are followed. She won't make decisions for anyone. She'll just... ...offer choices. Little to your left. That leaves a lot to chance. If you're good at anticipating the human mind... ...it leaves nothing to chance. It's time. Jesus Christ. Great. More bombs. All right. What'd you do to get here? I... I did something, and a bunch of people were killed. I didn't mean to. They're still dead. - That's why you're here? - Yeah. Shouldn't you have gone to jail for something like that? Nobody else knows. Somebody does. I didn't kill anybody, if that's what you're asking. I wasn't. I grant building permits. And yeah, some people might have been more deserving than others... ...but you know what? That's the business. So if someone tells you different, well, then they're just stupid. Or naive. Or both. Bullshit. You take bribes. You're a fucking liar. You cheat people. That's not nice. Yeah, well. I'm sure she's not exactly Mother Teresa either. No, I'm not. I build condos in one of the most densely populated cities in the country. You don't put up a new building without tearing down a few old ones. So we're all bags of shit that deserve to be here. That's good. That's great. Fucking great. So is that what you think this is? You don't think there's any other connection? No, I do. I do. And I don't give a shit. Close the fucking door. We have to hear the rules. Hello, and welcome. You must all be eager to learn the next important lesson in your transformation. The game before you is designed to bridge the gap between you all. In order to open the five locks on the door out of this room... ...the five electrical circuits powering them must be closed. The only way to do this... ...is to find a way to connect all five cords to the bath water. Close the circuits and the door will open. But you must work quickly... ...for in three minutes, an electrical current will surge through this room... ...locking the door forever. Who will bridge the gap? The choice is yours. Jesus Christ. It's not gonna reach. How the fuck are we gonna do this? Come on! You're gonna get in the tub... ...and we're gonna connect the five cords to you. But you're gonna kill me too. Get in. Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy. I don't think I'm gonna do that right now. Get in the fucking tub! Fuck you, you bitch. You get in the fucking tub. No, don't do it. Please, no. You killed her. You fucking killed her. I didn't trust her. Jesus Christ. What is it with you two? Just shut up and help me with the body. Hey, hey. No. Don't let your body touch hers. Oh, my God, it's a hook. Stick it in her head or we don't get out. Just do it. Come in. Sir. It's Jill Tuck. Good evening. Special Agent Erickson. Thank you for seeing me so late in the day. Not a problem. That'll be all. Please, have a seat. So, what do you need from us? I think I'm being followed. Well, that sounds more like police work, Miss Tuck. I don't think they can help me. - Because? - Because it's you. The FBI. I don't understand. It started when John was first identified as the Jigsaw killer. It didn't surprise me then, but I'm still being followed. By who, Miss Tuck? Who would be following you? I think it's the agent who interrogated me. Agent Strahm. - And why would he be following you? - I don't know. - Who else have you told about this? - Only you. What's going on with Amanda? Didn't you tell me the only way to truly offer enlightenment... ...is by detaching emotionally? But you can have something Amanda doesn't. Anonymity. That's the greatest protection. That's what I've given you. I need you to set up a game... ...that may not be entirely clear to you right now. But I assure you that the people being tested... ...are part of something much larger. They're connected. So in the end, all the pieces will fit together... ...and it'll be clear. - Amanda will fail you. - We'll see. What are you doing? - What's this? - It's time to play a game. Help. Help me. What is this? What is this? Please. Why are you keeping me here? What is this place? What is this place? We were all supposed to die. He's just fucking testing you. Where is my daughter? Help! He didn't make it. Nobody made it. You were supposed to be the hero. Peter, where the hell are you? Hello? You've reached the voice mail for Special Agent Peter Strahm. Leave a message. Cowan. I wanna put a locator on Strahm's mobile phone. Right away, sir. Call me right back. Right. - What the hell is that? - It's our next nightmare. There are blades in here. It's connected to the door. When the beaker fills up, the door opens. Fills with what? Blood. Our blood. I think an arm is supposed to go in there to fill the beaker. Wait. Why can't we just use the water from the other room? No, the slots are closed. We have to stick our arm in to keep them open, but they'd get stuck. We need to close that door. So, what? We fight to the death, and one gets to freedom with the other person's blood? Hey, wait, wait, wait. Do you still have the keys from that first room? - Yeah. - Try one of them on that door. - It won't work. - No, it might. This one has a keyhole. It... It's not even the same lock. Wait, why are there five slots in this machine? Shouldn't there only be one? They all would have worked. There you are, Strahm. All right. I got him. I don't think this is a good idea. The tub wasn't meant for one person. We were supposed to hold one cable each... ...and suffer a small shock. It was meant for five people. They all were. Every game. We only needed one key in the first room. They all worked, and any one of them would have opened every collar. In the second room, the three tubes were large enough for more than one person. We were supposed to work together so we all survived. That's the game. Your instincts will tell you to do one thing... ...but I implore you to do the opposite. Oh, God. Yeah. Big fucking whoops. Hello, and welcome. This journey has been one of discovery... ...and hopefully you've discovered that the whole... ...is greater than the sum of its parts. The human body, for instance, is an astoundingly durable creation. It contains approximately 10 pints of blood... ...yet it is still able to operate with just half of that. The device before you is one of sacrifice. A sacrifice of blood. In order to open the door, the beaker must be filled to the marked level... ...a level that is of no coincidence. This amount can come from any one of you. That does not matter. What does matter is time. For in 15 minutes, if the beaker is not filled... ...the bombs will explode and the doors will be sealed forever. So now I ask you, how much blood will you give in order to survive? Fuck! Fuck. All right, so one person can fill the beaker with ten pints of blood and die. Or two people can fill it... ...with five pints... ...and maybe live. What are we gonna do? I lied. I know the investigative journalist in there. His name is Charles. He was writing a story about what I did. What'd you do? A dealer gave me... ...an ounce of heroin to burn down an abandoned building. But it wa... Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned. There was eight people in there. Eight people died. And the feds got involved. And I got caught but I made a deal and my dad got me off. The guy who hired me disappeared and nothing happened. Nothing happened. That's how she knew me. The woman in the tub. The fire. It's what connects us. The fire inspector who wrote the bogus accident report... ...the city planner who pushed through the residential permits... ...the journalist that buried the investigative story... ...the rich-kid junkie who was the patsy... ...and the real estate developer who set it all in motion. We killed eight people and stole the property, and nobody cared. Nobody cared? Eight people and their families cared. The feds cared. Look at my fucking arm. I cared! I cared! But you didn't face justice. None of us did. Why did they all do it? Why? Was it for money? This was your plan? You were the one behind it? There was eight people in that building. You had to know that. Did you know that? You're a monster. So are you. We both deserve to be here. I can't do this alone. Look at me. I can't do this alone. Okay. It's okay. We have to go on three. One. Two. Put your hand in the hole! Three! Hello, Agent Strahm. If you are hearing this... ...then you have once again found what you're looking for. Or so you think. Your dedication is to be commended. But I ask you if you have learned anything on your journey of discovery. As the old adage goes: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. " The situation you find yourself in is one of trust. So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm, have you learned to trust me? The only way to survive this room is by entering the glass box before you. Pain will be incurred, but you have a chance of survival. We did it. We won. We won. I got you, you motherfucker. Drop it! I said drop it! Who did this to you? Who did this to you? We won. We won. We worked together. I need immediate medical assistance. 1293 Sandburst Drive. Jesus, Peter. Tell me how to open it. How do I open it? However, if you choose not to, you will never be heard from again. Your body will never be found. You will simply vanish. I ask you, Special Agent Strahm, have you learned enough to trust me? Will you heed my warning? - For if you do not... - Fuck you. ...this room will forever be your tomb. And my legacy will become yours. If you're good at anticipating the human mind... - I think I'm being followed. - Who would be following you? I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time. He suspected someone on the inside. ...it leaves nothing to chance. We were all supposed to die. You were supposed to be the hero. Make your choice. Cowan. Yeah, this is Erickson. I want you to put out an APB. Suspect's name is Peter Strahm. Yeah, that's right. Special Agent Peter Strahm. I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch. I know who you are. I know.
