Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into. What do you mean I got you into? Pfft! Well, you sold that policeman that bottle of beer, didn't you? I didn't know he was a policeman. I thought he “was a street car conductor. Pfft! Hey, me over here. - What's your name? - Stanley Laurel. Say 'sir' when you're addressing me. Now what's your name? Sir Stanley Laurel. Pfft!

That's what I'll do. Upstairs. This way. - [ Inmate ] Hello, there, buddy. - Shut up! - What? - Amos and Andy. Hello, squirt. Hello. Pfft! All right. Inside. Come on. Inside! I said, hello, squirt.

Call out every man. Cover every inch of ground, north, south, east, west. Call up every police station within 50 miles. Get in touch with the sheriffs office. We captured the Tiger's gang. We caught them down the old stone quarry. But it's those two new fish. They got away. Not a sign of them. They disappeared as if the earth swallowed them. Well, don't worry about those two babes in the woods. Use the bloodhounds. Those hounds never fail. They'll trail them so straight, it'll be a cinch. Those hounds are ferocious killers. Ha ha! I'd like to see their face when they hear those hounds. Hop to it.

How did you find out? We overheard those two new fish talking it over. You wanna see 'em? No. I haven't time. So, the Tiger and his gang are at it again, eh? I've no time to question those two fish now. I'll tell you what to do. Double the guard on the front gate. Put more men on the walls. Pull a guard around the arsenal. Tell the governor we may need the militia. Train your biggest guns on the front gate. That's where we'll need the most. So they wanted a showdown, did they? They wanted a fight to a finish, did they? Well, by the livin' Lucifer, they're going to get it! Go on, now, hop to it. Hey. What's the big idea? We're just in conference. Well, do your conferring down at the mess hall. Fall in. We are not going to the mess hall. We are not going to eel. You're not going to eat? No. We're on a hunger strike. Emphatically. What? You're going to pass up that nice, big roast turkey? With chestnut dressing... and sweet potatoes, southern style? Great big pan of hot biscuit? And strawberry short cake, smothered in whipped cream? Sprinkled with powdered sugar, with a nice big maraschino cherry on the top of it? Close followed by a nice big slice of ice cold watermelon. And a big, black cigar. Ally nuts? All you can eat of them. How about postponing the strike till tomorrow? Well... But not one minute after tomorrow. Come on. Fall in. [ Whistle ] [ Whistle ] Find yourself a seat down there. Hey! What about that turkey dinner? - [ Gunshot ] - Sit down, you! Haven't we had bad luck enough without you spilling the salt? Make a wish and throw some over your left shoulder. [ Mouthing ] Psst!

Fire! - Ah! - [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] [ Screams ] Why did you fire like that in the mess hall? They changed the lock before we got ready! - Hey, Tiger! - What do you want? - Look what I got! - Oh, great, great! Now we can make our getaway through the left wing! Come on. Let's get 'em. Why don't you be careful? The dirty double-crosser. He tried to mow us down like rats. My boys. And you are my boys. I hold in my hands the pardons for both of you. This is the State's gesture in showing its appreciation of your bravery. It was the filing of the signal shots in the mess hall that saved us from a disaster of cataclysmic dimensions.
