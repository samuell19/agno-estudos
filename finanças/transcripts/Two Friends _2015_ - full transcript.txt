Shower time is over, get out! - What do you want? - To go out. I'll send you a guard. Let's go. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Goodbye. Have a good day, ladies. See you tonight! - You're five minutes late. - I know. - Good morning. Who's next? - One lemon tart please. Anything else? 3,20 euros please. Thank you. Hello. I've told you not to come here. - But... - No buts! No buts between us! But... Buttered croissants please. Go away. Just go away. Go! Excuse me, sir. Not too much... Careful! Clément... I'm going to die. Wait a second. Are you okay? - I'm going to die. - Are you okay? - I am ridiculous. - I promise you're not. I need to catch my train. My mother is waiting for me. No. Pass me my bag. Then we saw each other three days in a row. Never for long, she had to catch her train. We'd meet in a café, she didn't want to be seen with me. Goddammit Abel! It's starting again. It's just like before! I don't understand. When did you last see her? Yesterday, at the café. You alright? Come. It's a bird! I can't look after a bird. I don't want one. You think it's ugly? No, it's beautiful. That's the main thing, isn't it? Listen... We need to stop seeing each other. Why? When? I can't be with someone. Not for the moment. I can wait, you know. - There's no point. - No, but... You know... Listen, I don't want you to come anymore. Ok? Nothing personal. I know you're nice. You're not a bad guy. What's going on? No, but... It's your family. Right? They can survive without you sometimes. Forget me. Wait. Sit down. At least take the bird. I'm allergic to sparrows. - It's not a sparrow. - Let me go. Don't do that! She refused to speak to me this morning. What should I do? Go back or not? But I can't think anymore, dammit! Get some newspapers. Plenty of them and read them all. Ok? Just do the crosswords... Never mind, it'll keep you busy. I'll join you in 1 h 30. I'm working at 11.30 a.m. Yes. And we'll meet up tonight. Ok? Don't worry, everything's fine. I have to go, bye buddy. See you later. Ciao! Excuse me... I've just had some worrying news from a friend. - Do you mind if I smoke? - No problem. Do you want a shower or are you clean? It's ok. I'm clean. Hello? It's me. You ok? Where are you? Outside my school. - Really? - Yes. Funny, I'm there too. Are you kidding? - Can I come over? - No. - I can't? - No. Get lost! Your buddies look cool! My love! You stink of cigarettes. Think I didn't see you smoking? Think that makes me happy? - I don't care. - Why can't I meet your friends? Why not? - Because I'm dating an old guy. - So? - You'll think they're losers. - No. Let's film! Quiet please. Laurent, ready? - Camera. - Action! - 8 over 1, first take. - Action! Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Your ticket please. - What's up, Rachid? - He stopped me. Because I don't have a ticket. Why did you stop him? He didn't show me his ticket. He stopped me for my ticket! - The camera is behind me. - What do you mean? - What's your name? - Clément. You're doing great, Clément. But you can't see it. Yes, we can! I'm the one looking. It's just that... If you don't see the ticket, it changes the film. It's going to be a great film. Really. Back in position! So Rebecca is dating Pierre. No. I don't get it. Oh, I love your friends! Good evening. - Let's do the test. - No. Either you do it or I lock you up. Trust me. Don't argue. Go. Thanks. That's fine. Zero. Very good. Good night. Good evening. - Unleaded? - Unleaded 98. Where can I find a grocery? There's one on the left. Thanks. I'll be back in a minute. I'll be right back. Miss, could I read you something? Why? Well, it's something that I wrote. If I read it to someone I might get a bit of perspective. Is it long? No, it's just the beginning. Why not? Go ahead. "If only we could start all over again. "But we can't. "Every second leaves a mark on our existence. "We believed that we lived in a draft, "that we could later erase, rewrite better, "bigger, stronger. "But we can't. "We only get one chance. "We have to write neatly the first time. "It's terrifying but it makes our lives grand." Keep the change. So, did you like it? Clément! Pick up or I'll set off your car alarm again. Clément! Shit. Dammit! No. Shit! Holy shit! - Police! - It's a friend's car. - It's my friend's. - Don't move. That's my car! Don't hurt him. That's my car. Let's go. - I swear it's his. - Mind your head. They cut each other's faces with pieces of broken bottle. Their faces slashed to there and they end up in hospital. Are you with her or not? That's not the issue. Yes it is! I want you to stop. Stop seeing her. You have to stop. Meet her and tell me what you think. If you think she's great or not, if I'm the one who's crazy. Fine, I'll meet her. Don't get yourself all worked up. I'm the one who ended the story. Before I'd even lived it, I told myself that it was over. You're not gonna cry, are you? I'm scared it's starting again. Don't be silly. Do you think it will? No, it won't. You will meet her, won't you? You'll tell me what you think. Alright? Want to call someone? Sure. I'll be right back. Hello? Colette? - Yes. - It's me. I got myself arrested by the police. Why? Nothing. Something stupid. - Do you want me to come? - No. I'm not in Paris. I'll be here for two days. Only a few hours, it's just a quick check. - What? - Do you need clothes? No. They're doing the rounds in the yard. I have to go. Who you gonna call? I don't know. Can I use your call? Yeah. How do I do that? I'll tell the guy you need to make a call, and you'll call Jeanne. Do you mind? No, I don't. Tell her: "I am informing you that Abel has been arrested." Easy. - Ok. - Don't overdo it. Must I be that formal? She mustn't recognize you. Ask her if she has a message for me. Hello? Yes? Hello? Is it Jeanne? Yes. I'm just informing you that Abel has been arrested by the police. What happened? I can't tell you any more. Who's that? Is that you, Clément? Listen, if you want me to pass on a message... Don't pass on anything! I want him to stop. Stop what? He has to stop contacting me. I no longer want to hear his voice. Alright. He's the most self-centered person I've ever met. I don't need nasty people. I want kind people around me. Well, ok. - Are you his friend, Clément? - Yes. Then you need to help me. Because it's getting really embarrassing. I've been with someone for two years. Two years? I understand then. - I pity him, Clément. - "Pity"? Yes, pity! I'm sorry to tell you this, but I'm not kidding. Is there anything I can do? God no! Nothing at all. Sure? Absolutely. Don't do anything. I hate feeling pity, tell him to piss off. Is that clear? Very. I understand. Then goodbye, Clément. Goodbye. Thanks. - What did she say? - She's very concerned. Of course I didn't tell her what happened. Well done. Did she tell you about that guy? No. Why? I feel she's not doing so well right now. I can feel it. Thank you. Let's get some rest. I'm exhausted. I'll sleep on the ground. Shit! Watch out. That's fine. These days, I fall asleep telling myself "Love exists." - I'm at peace. - Alright. You need to ask your building manager for an intercom. I mean a door code. You think I've got a building manager? You think I've got one? Can you hear? There are bells ringing. Perhaps it's a marriage. No. Someone's died. How can you tell if it's a marriage or a funeral? Here, look. - Come and show me who it is. - No. - You go. - Come! - Go ahead. - Come with me! That will be 9.70, please. Of course. Thank you. Have a nice day. Goodbye. Good morning, sir. Hello. Are these rhubarb tarts? The ones in front, yes. Not that fresh, hey? They were made this morning. Really? They don't look great. They were made this morning. - They're not made here, are they? - In a kitchen, downstairs. - You need a minute? - Take care of this man's order. I like to know what I eat. There are napkins on the side. We have ham and butter or tuna sandwiches. Ham. Thank you. Have a nice day. Will that be all, sir? Get in line, sir. Come. So you're Mona? That's right. You don't like birds? - No, no, no. - Wait. Why didn't you accept his gift? It wasn't a big deal. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm working. I understand. I'm here as a kind of ambassador. Take a second to explain and I'll leave. - There are customers waiting. - Your colleague can manage. What's the problem? You're not free, is that it? Who are you? I just asked you a question. I'm totally free, just not for him. "Totally free"? What does that mean? My life is complicated, I have no space for anyone. Especially if they insist. Finished? Have you done what you had to do? Frankly, I don't understand. What? Dunno, I was expecting someone special. But you're quite common. Spot on! Extraordinarily common, jerk! Bastard. - So? - Don't wait for her permission. You're waiting for her, just be there. She doesn't want me there. No, you gave her a reason to doubt you. She's lost. She doesn't know what she wants. - Can't you see that? - Yes! Then why are you giving her the choice? Well, I... I can hardly take her hostage! No. Spend one evening with her. Don't ask for her permission. - I've done it many times. - Really? Of course! And? When you don't want a door to slam shut, what do you do? You put your foot in the door. That's it. Keep her with you tonight, she'll see you differently in the morning. - Yeah? - Of course. But what did you think of her? I mean... No, I told you, it's not about looks. - You don't think she's worth it? - It's not that. Yes, she's beautiful. She has a pretty nose, a wide forehead. Beauty complicates things, you know that. Abel, not this one! Not this one, Abel. Let me through. You're lame! Stay with me in Paris tonight. I told you, I have to go home. No. Let go of me. Let go of me! I'm sorry. Wait a second. - Let's meet at 4 p.m. again. - Get off me! - Let me go! - Stop her, holy shit! Stop her! Wait. - She's really stubborn. - Get in the carriage. - She's really stubborn! - Go and get her. - Wait. - Bring her out. Can I at least take you home? - No. - Just long enough to say goodbye. No means no. Don't push it. - But I'm sad. - That's not my problem. - Really, I'm very sad. - I don't give a damn. I didn't picture you with him. His name is Abel. He doesn't seem like you. No, he's a good guy. He just likes things to be efficient, that's all. Go on, go find him. Go. We'll have coffee one day. - Really? - I promise. It's not hard to get her out! No! What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! My train! My train! My train! Fuck! Fuck! My train! - You'll get the next one! - I'm late! I'm going to be late! Shit! You made me miss my train. - Calm down. - I'm going to kill you! Bastard! Motherfucker! I'm going to kill you! I wanted to help you. Sort your shit out! Help us do what? Do I know you? Are you going to take me back? Be careful, you're going to get hurt. - Goddammit. - Calm down! I'll stay with you. Ok? But what do I do now? What the hell do I do? What do I do? Everyone is staring. Let's go have a drink. Do you know the shit you're getting me in? You want us to pay for a taxi? I don't give a shit about your filthy money! - Calm down. - Is that your friend? Couldn't you find a better one? I have a car, I'll take you. No, I'll take the next train. Leave me alone! - I'll stay with you. - Give me your phone. Your phone! Give her your phone. This just had to happen to me. My god, I'm stupid! I'm stupid. Look at the shit you're getting us into. - Me? - Yes. Can't you use a bit of insight? You attract the crazy ones. Look at her. We need to look after her. Did I say that we wouldn't? You could find a regular girl for a change, not a girl locked away by her parents. - Will you be ok? - I have no idea. Don't worry, we'll wait with you. Abel, come. Shit. Are you okay? - Are you okay? - I'm alright. You, what do you do beside "train bouncer"? I'm speaking to you. He works in a parking lot. No. - What? - I don't work in a parking lot. What do you do then? I write things. What kind of things? Things like books. Ever heard of books? Little square paper objects. You're really funny. That doesn't suit you. What suits me then? Not you, him. Go ahead, what suits me? I don't know. But not a writer. And you're not embarrassed, asking for your parents' permission? At your age? Leave my parents out of this, will you? It's them who need to leave you alone. Because your life consists of selling sandwiches and going home before 9 p.m. So yeah... Go ahead, finish your sentence. Your life isn't dreamy, that's all. - Did I ask you to dream? - Can't help it. Piss off! That's elegant. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Sorry. Can't you look after him for one night? Is it really too much to ask? How much have you got on you? How much what? How much money. You know what it is, money? Ah, how much money. There, I'm sure we'll find an arrangement. I must have... around 20 euros. That works for you? That's far too much, really! What's going on? Mona, let's go, your train is in 10 minutes. Yeah. Where is your work? It's quite far away. Why? Can I come with you? Yeah... sure. Won't your parents get mad? Yes. But that's my problem. Shall we go? Take my bag. Alright. Hello, your Honor. Mrs. Duval here. It's about Mona Dessein, who's on partial release. She returned to us intoxicated last week, and has been consistently late. She called the establishment 3 hours ago, she claimed that she'd missed her train and would take the next one, but I have my doubts. It's been 3 hours and she still hasn't returned to her quarters. What I can suggest is that, if she comes back, we apply the D 124. If not, first thing tomorrow, I'll get the prosecutor's department to declare her as an escapee. Do you agree? Very well. Thank you, your Honor. Everybody here! We're all going on the set. Everybody, come closer please. I assume that you've all heard about May 1968. Don't forget it was a time of urban warfare. We picked up the cobblestones and we flung them. We didn't know what to expect, we took blows and it was really very serious. So we did it with a lot of energy and a lot of heart. Ok? Let's start shooting. Turn on the special effects. Car number 1. Go! Action! Justice nowhere, Police everywhere! Justice nowhere, Police everywhere! You're beautiful with that on. I'm in a rotten mood. I'm gonna kill them! Let's go. It's only the beginning, let's keep on fighting! It's only the beginning, let's keep on fighting! Come. I want to speak to you. - You know when I fell for you? - What? You were speaking to a Japanese customer at the café. A Japanese? What are you talking about? I fell in love with you when I saw you speaking with that customer. You were laughing because you couldn't understand. But not a scornful laugh, a laugh full of love, of hope. Stop. Clément, there's no reason for you to be in love. That's it! I fell in love with you. You can't just tell people that you've fallen in love with them. - Really? - You can't. Why? I don't want to know if you're in love. But you... - Do you love me or not? - That's not the question. You see, we share little secrets. Kiss me. Kiss me. I'm not in love with you. What? I adore you but I'm not in love. I can't fall in love. Understand? Forgive me. - I'm sorry. - Please... Do you understand? I'm not in love with you. Abel! Abel! Cut! Ok, listen up. We're going to take down the barricade and then, switch over to recording. Everyone get together under the porch. Let's go. Have you known Clément long? Why? I like him, I almost love him, but not the way he'd like me to. - I've had enough. - Make him understand. We'll start off softly, and build up the intensity. Ok? It's only the beginning, let's keep on fighting! It's only the beginning, let's keep on fighting! - Where did Clément go? - I don't know. He's not here? What are you doing? It's you! Fuck! Call the ambulance! What are you doing? Let me do it! Let me do it! Call an ambulance! Wait. What is it? He didn't do this because of me? - Of course he did. Why else? - No. I am not going in feeling guilty, and I'm not going to be convinced otherwise. Are we agreed on that? You alright? I brought your things. Thanks. Be careful. Stop worrying. Hi. You scared me a bit, you know. I didn't mean to. I'm still alive after all. Good evening. It's late, you should leave now. - Ok. - Thank you. Right... "Good evening. It's late. "You should leave now." They gave you sleeping pills? Yes. The bird needs to eat. - Ok. - Can you go by my place? My keys are just there. - Alright. - My tiny blue diamond. Good night. See you tomorrow. Good evening. Can I have a bottle of water, please? Why do you always look pissed off? Do you think it makes you look mysterious? Thank you. - Do you want some? - No thanks. I really feel like dancing right now. Bad sign. Can I have a beer? - Thanks. - You, sir? No, thank you. Clément is a lucky guy. Why is he lucky? He's always thinking about me, so he's not as lonely. MAIN ENTRANCE TO CHURCH Wait, what are you doing? - Let's go in. - I'm not going in a temple. Come on, it's pretty. Then I'm putting you a taxi. Do you believe in God? That depends. I see, you're very religious. Do they only need a cross? To get down on their knees or light a candle? The way they ask for forgiveness... Are they all sure that God is really there, watching over them, loving them? What do they ask of God? For example, the woman over there, who is she praying for? Maybe she's praying for her daughter in jail. Her daughter once so bright, so kind. Maybe she's praying to understand how everything got so bad, how everything turned into hell... so that when her daughter comes home, she will be able to forgive her. What's up with you? It must be the incense. What? I'm allergic to incense. What shall we do? We're going to feed his bloody bird. Then we're going to get undressed. We're going to take our clothes off, one at a time. I can go first. It will encourage you. I've wanted you since I saw your face in front of the sandwich shop. I'm not saying I want to be your wife, nor to have your children, but I want you to desire me. Tonight, I really need it. Otherwise, you can always leave me here, I'll be alright. Thinking about Clément? A little. I'm not thinking about him. Good morning. Good morning. Are you alright? Can I have a coffee? - Here. - Thanks. Did you sleep well? Are you okay? Wait. - You have to go. - What? Where is your sweater? Here you go! - Are you joking? - Hurry up, go on. What's wrong? Come on, put on your sweater. Hurry up. Put your fucking sweater on and get out of bed. You're hurting me. Take your things. - Are you mad? - Here's your bag. Now piss off. Get out of here. - That hurts. - I don't care. Nothing happened. It's your fault. Have a nice day. Take a coat, you'll stay warm. Shit! Clément? It's Abel. What's wrong? You're all pale. - I'll cook something. - I'm fine. - Where are we? - At the hospital. Let's get out. Come on. - That's against the rules. - Stop. - I'm calling the nurse. - No, don't. There you go. Wait. Don't move. - Careful! - Don't worry. Watch out. - You alright? - I'm good. It's really dangerous! No. Only 2 or 3 meters. No, no, no. Look, it's nothing. 2 meters. - It's really dangerous. - Come on. - Bring over both legs. - Dammit. - Both legs. - Wait. - There you go. Next one now. - I can't. I'm stuck. I'll count, that will help you. I won't jump if I don't want to. It's up to me. Shit! Don't speak so loud. - Shit! - Stop yelling! Just look at the ground. I'm afraid of heights, I can't. Look at the ground, it's nothing. Just look. Oh, you're right. Go! You sure? - Fuck! - What is it? - What is it? - Abel, why'd you do that? - What's going on? - He fell. It's really painful! - Can't we leave now? - He cut his arm. He needs attention. He's done it so often. I'm used to it. Why does he do it? It's not very original, it's a love story. He moves too fast. Things go too slowly for him. - You see? - No. So, listen up. The doctor made me sign the papers. I'll be in charge of you for 48 hours. Alright? I will think, you will listen. - Stop thinking. - But I wanna see her. Don't start again. You're not to see her. Wait! Holy shit. Wait! - I'm fine. - Stop! - You're not to see her. - I can't. You can't see her. Steer clear of Gare du Nord. Life's too hard without Gare du Nord. Many people live without setting a foot in Gare du Nord. I need to see her once, to apologize. Please. Calm down! Calm down. Stop. Relax. Fine, we'll go and see her again. Calm down. We'll go but to say goodbye. Goodbye, have a nice day. - Can I borrow your shampoo? - Yes. I don't have anything. - Not even a towel? - Nothing. Take this one. - I'm sorry, it's a bit damp. - That's great, thanks. You have 20 minutes to take a shower. If it's not busy, you can stay longer. What's your problem? I don't have any. I'm staying at a friend's. She missed her train. I lost my keys, I'm waiting. She gets back tonight, it's ok. Hey. - You alone? - I have my boyfriend. I'll get you dinner. You'll thank me for it. I'll come back here. I'll wait for you. What happened? - You know him? - Yes. - Is he diabetic? - No, why? He fell when he heard what happened to a waitress. Mona's dead? No, are you mad? What is it, then? I'm fine. I understand everything now. - I know everything. - What do you know? Wait for the ambulance! If they come for nothing, they'll have a go at me. It's a blessing in disguise. No. That's not right. It changes everything. Why does it? That's why she couldn't be with me. Bullshit. It doesn't change a thing. Wake up! She didn't return to jail, the police is after her. Imagine she came across some bastards. Anything can happen. - She must be starving. - Don't get carried away. We must find her, apologize, and help. You wanna get mixed up in her problems? Wait a second. I'm sorry, I beg your pardon. I thought you were being a coward. It doesn't matter. Listen... we'll go backwards, ask questions, investigate. When was the last time that you saw her exactly? When we left the hospital, we went to a café. She was thirsty. Which café? - I don't know. - Try to focus. I mean... What happened next? She wanted a taxi, I accompanied her... Which taxi company? I need to talk to you. - Which taxi company? - I've forgotten. First, she wanted to go into a church. A church? There's one by the hospital. I can't remember. I was a bit drunk. Wait... You had been drinking? You never told me. Very well. And then? Nothing at all. That's all that happened. We'll go back to the church. Ok? It's likely she went back. Let's hope the priest is cooperative. Let's go. Come on! Where's the church? Where's the priest gone? Really, where is he? - Wait a sec. - What? - I remember now. - What? She may have slept at mine. You lent her the keys to feed the bird, right? Yes, probably. - Fuck. - What is it? - You didn't feed the bird? - No. Yes. We went to your place just to feed the bird. You're losing me with all your questions. Right. Let's go to mine. Come on. I don't recognize the area. Everything's changed. I used to come here all the time. What are you doing here? - Chestnuts. - You can't. See, there's no one. She had no reason to come back. She's cleared off. Let's go. - It's better this way. - Why? Because we know nothing about her. Except that she lied to us. I'd even say that she's completely forgotten about us. Well, that's life, you know. Let's go eat. I've had enough. Wait! Mona? Ah, I didn't remember which floor it was on. - We learnt a lot about you. - Shut up. - That's my coat. - It is. I know that I scare you, I can understand, but you have to give me a second chance. I think that... You know, I think that I'm a good person. I can't force you to love me, but I don't wanna lose you. You're beautiful, complex, fascinating. And you're not boring at all. I just want us to keep seeing each other. Would you like us... to stay friends? I mean... Would you like to be in my group of friends? Please, say something... - Sure I would. - Really? Of course. Can I kiss you? I haven't eaten all day. But friends kiss all the time. - Can I kiss you on the lips? - Stop. Can you give me your keys? So I can... Can you just sit down, please? Sit down, we need to talk. - What about? - Just... Sit down, please. Mona, you should cover your ears. No, you should hear this actually. What's going on? You and I have been through a lot together. Yes, why? How can I tell you? I get nothing out of it anymore. Meaning? Meaning... I don't like what you've become. I just don't like you anymore. I can't stand the way you talk to me anymore. Always lecturing everyone. You're selfish. Yeah, selfish. I used to find you handsome, and strong, now you're just average. And I can't stand... your slyness. You see? I'm a fragile guy. - You know that. - Yes, I do. I fall down very easily. I need to be with trustworthy and transparent people. Sorry, I just feel as though you don't think of us as friends anymore. We can see each other. But just like that... Like... No longer as friends. We'll see each other as what? Nothing. We'll see each other as acquaintances. You know? Listen, I think that's very wise. I think there's nothing worse than a forced friendship. Let's have a drink to celebrate, right? - Let's go. - Give me your keys. - Here. - Are you serious? - That's a great idea. - What is? You don't have to come. Wait. I'm responsible for him. - How could I know? - Let go. - Tell me. - Get off me. I couldn't care less why you're in prison. If you're working that means you'll be out soon. You're about to fuck that all up. So you're a specialist in penal code now? Tell me what I can do. Nothing, I can manage on my own. Let me go. We're friends! I'm going to dance. You weren't serious before? Yes, why? We're not kids, don't start sulking. I'm not sulking. What about your acquaintance thing? Well look, I'm going to pay for her and for myself, not for you. Hey! Why are you sulking? Dressed like a redneck. I didn't know it was a fancy dress party, sorry. Some stupid bitch just had a go at me. Come on, relax. This bitch just went off at me. People come out just to piss each other off? - There are lots of people. - I don't care. Everything is joy here. This is going really well. It's just great. - It's cool. - What? - I said: "I'm glad for you." - Yes. What? I'm glad for you! They're beautiful, aren't they? Nothing but flesh though. He's crazy. - What? - You're crazy. Hey stop. We're not friends anymore. - Are you bored? - I don't think so. No, I never get bored. I'm just a little tired. Can we talk seriously now? You want to know why I'm in prison? No, I don't want to know. What about you, Abel? I don't want to know either. Fine, just as well. Let's go there? Where? The hotel, just there. How many stars? You want us all to sleep together? I don't have a toothbrush. You're taking us to a hotel? Actually you were right, she's a very strange girl. - The three of us there? Weird! - Can you please leave us alone? Why? It's the least you could do as a friend. I thought we weren't friends? - Go on, piss off. - Alright, I'm going. Thank you. If I go, you'll never see me again. Never. You're ditching me for some stranger. Is that what you want? - That's right. - Come on, you two! Come. Can't you see that you're acting like a jerk? Perhaps you'll thank me. She might be a very dangerous girl. Miss, for you, number 14, it's on the first floor. - And for you, gentlemen, 22. - Good night everybody. - Good night. - Thanks a lot. Good night. And if you need anything, I'm right here. I'll be here all night. - Thank you. - Good night. Sleep well. You too. Good night. He thinks we're together. Who cares? I'm hurt you want to ditch me. - Nobody cares. - Don't treat me like a dog. - Where are you going? - To kiss Mona good night. - Who is it? - It's Clément. - What do you want? - Are you ok? I forgot to kiss you good night. Come in, I'm brushing my teeth. Is somebody there? - Who is it? - It's Abel. Just to say good night. I'm brushing my teeth. It's not funny. Who do I start with? Me. Can I use your toothbrush? Yeah. Why? Good night, my little darling. I don't know but... you're kissing me like a 12-year-old. What did you expect? I don't know, like a friend. For example, imagine you're 15 years old, you're totally wasted, you've just passed your finals... Right, I'm ready. Off you go, bedtime. Sleep well. Good night. Good night. Hello? Mrs. Rapet? Good evening. Did I wake you up? I'm sorry. Mona... Mona Dessein. I'm in a hotel room. Hotel Les Trois Nations, 13, rue du Château-d'Eau. I know I've got myself into a difficult situation. Yes, I have an explanation. No, I won't go anywhere. They're going to come and get me? 14. No, I won't move. Goodbye. "Each calls himself a friend, but let's beware. "The name's as common as the thing is rare." What's that? Have we ever really been friends? Well, you know... When we met, you really impressed me. Really? Why did I impress you? Dunno. Just your presence. When we walked into a room, I would hold myself upright. I was dying to please you. I think I was a stronger person because you were there. I remember, when I was anxious, when I wasn't well, I mean when I was with people who made me anxious, when I didn't know what to say, I'd imagine what you'd say. I thought about you, in my shoes, and it worked. That's funny. I used to think the same sort of thing. I thought everything that was yours was mine. I had that same thought, plenty of times. I thought that... Let's be honest. We can agree on the fact... that we managed better together. Yeah. We did much better. It's been a while since you showed me something new. We keep criticizing one another. It's become petty, don't you think? No, I don't. I mean, we've become pathetic. Haven't we? You've got nothing left to teach me. Nothing left to teach you? You make me laugh. I'm here for you. That's not what I mean. What do you mean then? When you speak, I just don't listen anymore. You bore me, I pretend to listen to you. If I have something important to say, something that really matters, I don't come to you anymore. - Then who? - Other people. People that I don't know very well but who want to be impressed. We really were friends, once, I swear, now it's all over. I'd rather sleep than talk to you. Yes, I agree. I think... I think I'm going to run away with Mona. You know. We're going to escape. I think that it would make me the happiest man alive. Mum, I did something stupid. I'll get another 6 months, no doubt about it. I'll make it out okay. And I want you to hold on as well. I can tell you that I may have done it on purpose. Maybe I was frightened to leave this place, of what is outside. Now, I can't wait. I'll be happy to leave. In one month, one year, who cares? I'm going to get out. I'm writing to you so that you don't worry. It's a joyful letter. It will make you cry, I know, yet it's full of my joy. Kisses from your daughter. Maybe we should have been musicians. Music to dance to, to smooch to. People need to be in groups. Or life makes no sense. Every one of us will end up alone, buddy. Completely ignored. Son of a bitch. He's unbelievable. The goddamn son of a bitch! Are you insomniac? A little, I can't sleep. Mona? Mona, it's Clément. Open up. Your boyfriend's asleep? He's not really my boyfriend, you know. Yeah. I was like you for a long time. What do you mean? Refusing to label things. Not defining it. I thought it'd ruin everything. Really, I swear he's not. It's none of my business. Drink up. What you're doing is really disgusting. You just don't give a shit about me. You're pretending I don't exist. For fuck's sake! Shit! I'll scream louder and louder. Hit harder and harder. Dammit! Dammit, I find you handsome. You're handsome too, you know. I find you really handsome. I'm going to come and join you. What the hell? You wanna see how much suffering I can take? Whose idea was it? Who was it? You, Abel? Fuck. Frankly, it doesn't scare me. It doesn't scare me. I'll throw myself under a car. You get it? I can do it! That's what gets you hard. I'll do it. I'll kill myself. Abel! Can you hear me? I'm going to kill myself! This is the end, really. It's not doing anything for me. What if I slide it up a bit more? There. It's not doing anything for me. What's wrong? Hold on, what the hell is he doing over there? What's he doing? Shit. What are you doing? Where are you going? Enough! What's wrong with you? What is it? Where are you going? What's wrong? Let go of me. - What's the matter? - Let go. Wait. Clément. Leave me alone. What do you want? Hold on. It's all over for me. I'm finished, Clément. You're the only one I've got. I no longer believe in your pain. I forgive you. Tell me the truth. What truth? Did you fuck her? What are you saying? Are you crazy? How can you say such things? What? But no. No, I swear, nothing sinful happened between Mona and me, right? TWO FRIENDS
