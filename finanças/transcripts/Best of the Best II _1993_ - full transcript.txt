Come on, I can tell you two fools to. Wait a minute. Yes now come on. You're crazy. - Come on, I can tell you both. You're crazy... Go to hell with you. Hey Walter here are signs. - Thanks. James ran away with a few, bad people. It was always a fight for the wrong reasons. And one day, he just disappeared. He went abroad to fight. He left without saying goodbye. He took all of her grandmother's life savings with... And I will never forgive him for that. I'm sorry. Was he a good fighter? We heard that he won some tournaments. But when he had a car accident... vreslijk. He almost died. And his life nearly collapsed in. Four, five, six, seven... What is beauty? How long will we stay here? I do not know. Until we are finished exercising... What is it? I looked during your workout, Dad. I know you're gonna kill Brakus or he will kill you. No one will kill me. I promise you. I saw him, how he killed Travis, Dad. I saw him die. I know, Walter. I have to protect other people against Brakus. Just like in a war. As a war. Are you afraid? Yes. Gonna help Tommy now? Yes. I will help the boy. Pleasure. Here's a dollar. Give it to him for a bowl of soup. I know what happened and what you think you cost... But the son who left me many years ago in search of his manhood... Who returned home drunk self-pitying and as a grown child. You are a terrible example for our people. And a disgrace to your mother. You now have the chance to do something good. Help Tommy, or you can pack your bags. Walter? Walter? - Yes. Will you help me to feed the chickens. - Sure. This is great. Good morning, Mom. - Good morning, James. Where are they? - Rear. Tommy, Alex. - This is a private conversation. Not on my mother's property. Is not that... Know I'm so tired of your bullshit. Mama told me about your problem. I have come to help. I know Brakus. I already saw him fight. If you want to fight with him, need to be prepared to die. You think I'm just a drunk. - You're a drunk. Yes, I am. But I am one of three people in the world... You can learn how you can win Brakus. You're a fool. - Tommy. What? - You Remember the accident? Yes, what then? Brakus was the car. I had the accident. I can train to beat him if you're not too proud. If you ever want to get past the guards... Will have to fight with these things. Pick it up. Not with your hands. So. Good. Now let's see what you got. - What should I do? Attacks. Okay. We have a long way to go boy. Weldon. Do not disappoint me. Bring me Tommy Lee, alive. Go inside. - What? Go inside. - Why? Part of the training. Come on, gentlemen, come on. - Okay. Tommy, after you. It's too hot. I can not breathe. Tommy, I'll meet you outside. Alex, Brakus would continue. Even if a man would be dead. This tent is the sweat church. The heat increases the temperature of the body, such as fever. Sometimes it may be that as the white man says hallucinations arise. We call them visions. Messages from spirits. Come on, Walter suit. What is it? - A talisman hoses. A snake can take a life or save a life. This will protect you. I do not understand. - Is this true? It is a symbol of courage. Do you know what courage is? Course. If you are not afraid. No, courage is not the absence of fear. It means doing the right thing, even in the presence of fear. Sometimes you just need someone's butt kicking... . You did a great job. I mean, you are now ready to a higher level of training you go. And grab all your stuff for a good night's sleep. And tomorrow we begin our journey. Slowly, slowly. Come, let me see your hands. Slow, slow. Okay, we have them. Come on. Slow down boss. Let's finish this. - Finally. Down hell. James. Do not move or I, open a third eye. Now everybody up. Except you. Mr. Brakus wants you for himself. Let's go. Inside, please. Brakus Mr. and Mr. Weldon Dardano send you their greetings. Do not kill my son. - He will be clean. Come on, I'm hungry. Okay, turn around and down on your knees. Drizzle to to the helicopter. You also child, turn around. I have not got all day. Are you deaf, tough guy? - Have courage. Or do you want it in your face? Dad. Where is Gus? It's about time. They expect four shots. You never touch me. Where is Gus now? - He takes a sweet time now. I'll go. - No we're gone in 30 seconds. Acceptable loss. - As Hell. Can I, Mr. Finch? Can I do it? Fire his ass. O shit. I hab been always told Gus, that his death would be smoking. Let's go fly. Come on. Give me your hand. Come on grandma. Let's go. Jesus. Motherfuckers. Motherfuckers. Grandma, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Enough. I said enough. Well, well. He?? is interesting.
