How's that washed-up husband of yours doing? - [Elaine] Marty, well, that's what I was calling about, Deac. I just don't know what to do. Marty had an accident, he's-- - What is it? - [Elaine] Dead, Deac, a car wreck. - A car wreck, when? - [Elaine] Two weeks ago. That's what the sheriff's calling it, a car wreck. I just don't know. I didn't know if you knew. - No, no, I'm sorry to hear that. - [Elaine] I've been running the bar by myself, and all I can do-- - Well, don't worry about it, I'll, uh, I'll come up there this afternoon. - [Elaine] Oh, thanks, but you must have things to do and-- - No, no, it's no problem. I've got, I've got not urgent business. I'll be up there today. - [Elaine] You're a good friend, Deac, thanks very much. - Okay. (phone tone beeps) (mid-tempo serious music) - Fill it up, will ya? - Hey, Audrey. Let's leave town for the weekend, eh? - Just a second. Three bucks. - Put it on my tab. - You at least gonna bring the bottles back? (engine revs) (tires screech) (bottle clangs) What do you want? - Well, tell me you're not married and the mother of three kids. - I'm not. - That and a tank of gas, I'll be a happy man. - How many more of you guys are gonna show up? - How many more of me you think you can handle? - That'll get you to the next town. - Well, I'm not going to the next town. - Don't you guys ever get tired of making life miserable? - Nevermind. Lady, if you could tell me how to get to the Forty Niners Bar and Grill, I'd appreciate it. Keep the change. - Up there to the right. - Thank you. - Uh, are you Elaine's friend? - Yeah. - Uh, um, I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else (laughs). Welcome to town. - I'll accept your apology over dinner. - [Audrey] Okay (laughs). - What's your name? - Audrey (laughs). - [Deacon] Deacon Porter. - [Audrey] Hi. (slow piano music) - I didn't expect you so soon. Take a look at that picture. Marty sent me that just before you guys left Nam. - I remember the day we took this picture. ♪ Tell me what you see - Seems like a long time ago. Shame to go through all that combat, and then to buy it in a lousy car accident. - If it was a car accident. - Marty was too good a driver, and he knew these roads too well. That was no accident, Deac. - Who'd wanna kill-- (door thuds) - Elaine. This the new help? - [Elaine] Deacon Porter, Clay Marsh. - Hi. - [Clay] Expect, we'll get to know each other. - [Elaine] Deac fought with Marty in Vietnam. - Vietnam. Porter, let me give it to you straight. We don't take to outsiders in King's Ransom. Outsiders usually mean trouble. And I don't need trouble. - I'm just here to help a friend. - See to it that you keep it that way. Elaine. - He always this friendly? - He has a problem with the growers. They've taken over the valley for their marijuana business. - [Jerry] Come on, come here, I wanna show you something, come on. - [Linda] What? - I'll show ya. - [Linda] Huh? - Ta dah! - Oh, wow, we drove right past here last night, and we didn't even see it. - It was too dark. It could've been anything. Look! - There's more growing over there. - I knew you'd like California better than Canada. (both laugh) - Oh, it's harvest time. - Right. (gun fires) (tense dramatic music) Run, run, dammit. - What's going on? - [Jerry] Hurry. This way. - [Man In Stripped Shirt] Over there! - [Jerry] You head for the highway, I'll try to draw their fire. - No, no! - [Jerry] Don't argue, please Linda, do it, go! - [Linda] Jerry! (gun fires) - [Man In Tan Jacket] Come on, this way! - [Man] Relax, they'll get him. - [Man In Tan Jacket] Come on, don't let him get away, shoot him. (guns fire) (Jerry grunts) - [Man On Left] There's our turkey. (men laugh) (gun fires) (Linda screams) (slow unsettling music) (Linda grunts) - Why you no good! - Come on, let's go. - (laughs) in it goes, boys! Woo hoo! (lively country music) - Have a beer, Deac. - [Deacon] Don't mind if I do. - This is my friend, Jim. - Hey. - [Deacon] How you doin' there, Jim. - Looks like Jim's gettin' pretty friendly with Porter over there. - [Man On Right] Yeah. - This here is my partner, this is Deac. - How are you? Nice to meet you. Excuse me just a minute. - Hi. - Hi. - [Man On Right] Let's do it. (upbeat country music) - [Man In Green] Doing some talking? What'd you tell that guy? Huh, what'd you tell him? - [Jim] I think you got-- - [Man In Green] Big mouth! I'll teach you to keep your big mouth shut. (woman screams) (man in green grunts) - Lock him up, I'll press charges later. - Come on, let's take a little walk. - [Carey] I thought you and I had an agreement. - I had no choice. The whole place saw what happened. If Porter hadn't stopped that goon of yours, he would have beat that guy to death. - He was just a little excitable, that's all. You can let him out, he's cooled down by now. - Can't do it. This time is different, Porter's pressing charges. - Don't worry about it, I'll handle Porter. Everything's okay. Here's a little something called bail money. - I gotta turn you down on this one Carey. - Have it your way. But remember one thing, I give the word, my boys will bury you in your hick town. Now you better think real hard, and see if you can't recall just who it is that's been keeping you in business around here. - Hawkins! - Sheriff? Yeah? - Release the prisoner. - Okay, Sheriff. - As usual, it's a pleasure doing business with you sheriff. (door thuds) (slow unsettling music) - [Man In Vest] I was at that party. I knew Marty pretty well. But you're talking to the wrong guy. I gotta go. - Excuse me sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, right now. - Thank you. (uptempo peppy music) - So how do you like rural life? - [Deacon] Seems everyone's too scared to talk to me. - [Man In Hat] Come on. - Damn growers, they think they own the town. - What about your sheriff? - I think they own him too. - I have an idea, why don't I take you for a ride through the countryside. - That's the best offer I've had yet. - Yeah, okay. (mellow country music) - Well, Audrey, don't you look pretty tonight. You really didn't have to get all dolled up on my account. - Ready? - [Audrey] Yeah. - Pardon me, I didn't realize you two were together. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend? - Deacon Porter, John Carey. - Welcome to King's Ransom, Deacon Porter. - Thank you. - [Carey] I hope you find our town to your liking. - You know what, Carey, it's not your town. - You ready? - Yeah. (door thuds) (tense dramatic music) (cars thud) (tires screech) - [Man] Son of a bitch! Come on, come on, get out. - Let's get him. (men groan and grunt) - [Man] Come on. - [Man] Grab hold of him, I got him! - Reese. (Deacon grunts) (punches thud) - Come on, Carey, you gotta stop 'em! - [Reese] Listen, Porter, we own everything in this town. (punch thuds) - [Audrey] Come on, they're gonna kill him, please! - Your boyfriend is just not a reasonable man. - Nobody owns me. - Please, stop it. (punches thud) - You want him, take him. Okay, boys, let him go. - I'm gonna try something else on this. Just a second. I think this is more the way to. (slow gentle music) Deac? - I gotta go. - Okay. - It was an accident. He had a few drinks, lost it on the curve, went over the cliff. - Doesn't sound like Marty to drink and drive. - Well, people change, they get careless. - Went through six years of combat with that man. He kept people alive because he wasn't careless. - Hey, Porter, I'm trying to be nice to you. - Don't be. I'll find out what happened to Marty with or without your help. I wanna see that coroner's report. - I don't have to show you anything. - I'll be back with a court order. - [Man With Rifle] Go right ahead, sheriff, you know the way. (men chatter) - We gotta talk. - [Carey] What's on your mind? - That guy Porter's threatening to open up the investigation in Marcus Darien's death. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, I think he means it. That's one guy you shouldn't have messed with. - Let him investigate. What's he gonna find out? - Maybe nothing. But if that coroner you paid off decides to talk, we're all in a lotta trouble. - He won't talk. - I think Porter can be pretty persuasive. - Get on back to town, I'll figure something out. - [Clay] Yeah. (slow suspenseful music) (gasoline sloshes) - Let's see how they like this. - Yeah. (tense gripping music) - [Man] Yee haw! (coughs) - [Deacon] Elaine! Elaine! (Elaine screams) (glass shattering) - [Man In Blue] Damn! (explosions rumble) (gun fires) - [Man In Flannel] Bob, what you think? - Come on! - [Man In Plaid] Got him (laughs). - [Man With Dark Hair] That's one guy won't be causing anymore trouble. - [Man In Plaid] Yeah, you can say that again. (both chuckle) - [Man With Dark Hair] Come on, let's get outta here. (slow somber music) - 16 bucks. - Nice and peaceful around here, huh? Too bad about your boyfriend. (Clay chuckles) ♪ I'm in the mood (hums and vocalizes) This isn't very sociable of you, Audrey. - I should kill you right now, you son of a bitch. - Hysterical again? - Get out. - [Carey] Get outta here. - Or I'll shoot your ass off. (lips smack) (slow gentle music) - Hey, Deac. - Spence? - This is it? - [Deacon] You bet. - Come on, Deac, you were lucky the last time. You go back up there again, they're gonna kill you for sure. - Gotta go back. - Why? - Just something I gotta do, that's all. - Will you knock off the John Wayne shit for a minute and be realistic? - Did you bring the stuff? - Yeah. Listen, you know I'm the best electronics specialist in the business. Now I've been doing it for 20 years, I can do it in my sleep. You think you can learn everything from a book overnight? Forget it Deac, it's hopeless. You can't do it by yourself. I guess you're just gonna have to take me along. - It's not your fight, Spence. - Goddammit, Marty was my CO too. - I'm not taking you, now that's final. - [Spencer] Fine, I'm gonna help you whether you like it or not. - [Bartlett] You have my word on it. - This is a rather expensive order. I feel my partners will require something a little more substantial than your word. - I see your point. Perhaps the deed to my boat will suffice. - I think my partners will agree. - I'll have the papers for you this afternoon. - Half down, the balance on delivery, including the return of your collateral, of course. - Of course. - Salam, Mr. Bartlett. - See you around, greaseball. - You never change, do you? - Hey, Jesus, it's been a long time, man, long time. - I just looked for you over at the yacht club, they told me I'd find you out here. Nice boat (chuckles). - Hell, Art, this isn't my boat. That's my bucket over there. - (chuckles) You snake. - Look, uh, buddy, I know that- - I just thought I'd drop by to see if I could get you to change your mind about going with me to help Deac. - I can't do it. I can't go with you, I'm past it. - Come on. - You know what I do now? I keep the rich Arabs supplied with pop guns. It's a real nice arrangement. Now what can you say to me to make me wanna fuck that up? - You got a friend who needs your help. - I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll put together a package for you. It'll be good, all you need. But I can't go with you. - Call me when it's ready. (uptempo energetic music) (crowd chatters) - You on? Go, woo! Take it. Yah! - [Man With No Shirt] Whoo. - All right, come on, come on. Okay, come on. Cheese. Hey, rat, check this out. Want some balls, come on. (men grunt and groan) All right, come on chop suey. Chow mein time, brother (grunts). - Hey, the winner, yeah! (coins jingle) - [All] Cheater! - [Ox] Go, run, move it! (gun fires) - Get in! - [Ox] Spence, you saved my ass! (knocking on door) - Yeah? I'm coming. (knocking on door) Who is it? - [Ox] Where do you think you're going without me, mofo? - Ox? - Ah, (chuckles) yeah, Deac! - [Keith] I'm telling you, there's a lifetime supply up here. - [Student In Hat] Eh, far out. - [Keith] Come on, up here. - [Student In Hat] (laughs) Where man? - [Keith] Shh, just wait a minute. - [Student In Hat] Yoo hoo, marijuana! - [Keith] Hey, you gotta be serious here. - [Arnold] Where is this stuff? - [Student In Hat] Oh, look at that, man. - [Arnold] Oh my god. Wow, more, more. Hey, I'll get the sack. - [Student In Hat] Yeah, Arnold, get it. - [Keith] What do ya think? Mother Nature at its best. - [Student In Hat] True, man, Keith, you said it. - Not bad, huh? - [Student In Hat] Too green, man. Uh, look at that? - This sprig is a little you know-- (weapon fires) (student in hat grunts) (tense suspenseful music) - Hey, I think you got one. - [Man In Hat] Check it out, eh. Only a college kid. (weapon fires) - [Keith] Arnold, shit. Huh? (gun fires) - [Barbara] Mornin' Sheriff, how are ya'? - Barbara, good. - [Barbara] Good (chuckles). - [Reese] I'm worried about those kids, they went bonkers. Howdy, Miss Barbara. - Hi, Reese. - [Reese] You look mighty fine today. - [Barbara] Why, thanks. - [Reese] Well, look who's here, mornin'. - How's the sheriff business? - There's three kids missing from college over at Oak Hill. - Maybe they took off on spring vacation. - Maybe they didn't. Look, Carey, two campers disappeared from the east. That coulda happened anywhere. It's a big, wide country. I'm talkin' about local kids now. (Carey sighs) And I'm not the only one that's talking. - Well, then you better come up with some answers. - Don't push me. - What do you want? More money? - No more killings. - When I do a job, I do what the job needs. You're in too deep to tell me to do anything else. (slow ominous music) (thunder crackles) (knocking on door) (knocking on door) (slow gentle music) - My uncle closed this place years ago. Nobody comes around, I doubt Carey even knows about it. - Looks solid, boss. - This place checks out just fine. - All right, let's go get the gear. - Let's start a war, all right! - Better get back to the gas station. I don't want you gettin' hurt. - I'll keep an eye on things, okay? - Let's just torch the sons of bitches. - They'd be back in business again in two months. No, I wanna take these bastards apart one piece at a time. - You gotta be realistic, Ox, a little selective sabotage. - Look it, we're gonna fight a goddamn war, let's fight a goddamn war, do it. - We are, our way. (tense dramatic music) Look at this set up. Come on, take a closer look. - Hey! (man grunts) (man screams) - You still draw like a chicken. - Thanks. - [Man] Why'd you start? - [Man] Yeah, hear the whole thing, you want me to tell you the whole thing? - [Man] Yeah, starting from the very top. - [Man] Tell me about this chick, man, it's incredible, all right. Couldn't believe it myself. - [Man] So did you get any? - [Man] What you mean did I get any? Come on, who you talkin' to. (both laugh) - What's up? - You pick up some of my boy last night? - Now why would I do that? - Maybe you started to feel like a sheriff. Just answer me, Marsh. - Hey, I didn't pick anybody up. Jesus, you act like it was the first time these punks took off on ya. - Not three at once. - Maybe they took a spring vacation. - And maybe some other grower decided I had three men too many. - Hey, it's a tough business. - This is my territory. I pay you to keep it that way. - Well, it ain't much, Spence, but it's all we've got. - Yeah, Bart never came through. But it should be interesting. - I wish I had a bazooka. - Ox! - Oh! - Always complaining. - [Ox] You dickhead. You are a couple a. (mid-tempo rock music) (mellow country music) - Check out his car. - Here you are. - [Man In Hat] Just passing through, are you? - Yeah, something like that. - What sorta business you in? - Minding my own. - Where you staying at? - A motel down the road. - [Man In Hat] Uh huh. - Roach motel. - Shit. - Cam Thompson, there is cat hair in your armature. - [Boy] I'm sorry, Miss King. - Well, you know I usually get $35 an hour for this kind of work. Okay, half a piece of Double Bubble and a kiss from a future Monte Carlo winner. - [Bartlett] Hey, hey, somebody! - [Man] Come on, shit head, get your ass in here. (tense dramatic music) (explosions boom) (weapons fire) - [Spencer] Yahoo! - Spence, jeep! - Yeehaw! (Ox screams) (weapons fire) (gun fires) Bulls. - [Man On Radio] Boss, they hit both trucks, and blew the whole shipment up in smoke. - Repeat that. - [Man On Radio] The convoy is gone. Plus, we just caught a stranger with a van full of guns. - Shit. Reese, they took the convoy. - Jesus, I doubled the security. - Obviously, it wasn't enough. If it's a war they want, I'll give 'em one. (punches thud) (Bartlett groans) Who you workin' for? - Builder's Emporium. I'm in the lumbar department. - All you gotta do is tell us who sent you here. - Why don't you go buy yourself a dress. (punch thuds) (Bartlett grunts) - You think it's worth dying for? (Bartlett spits) (punches thud) (Bartlett groans) The guy's hardcore. Bring some boys into town. Chances are, he's not on his own. When he talks, I'll be over at the cafe. (Bartlett grunts) (punches thud) - Carey's boys picked up a guy at Jake's Diner couple hours ago. Jake said he had a whole van full of guns, military stuff. - Bartlett. Where? - Jail, I think. (tense suspenseful music) - Oh, Jesus. (men grunts) (Hawkins groans) - Ah ah! - [Deacon] Just stay real quiet. (keys clang) - [Hawkins] Hey, I'm going, I'm going. - [Ox] Move it, come on, you wienie, get in there. - Hey, sleeping on the job, again, huh? (Bartlett groans) Come on. - [Ox] Okay, in, dickhead. Pissant, punk. - [Man In Cell] What the fuck. You won't get away with this (moans). - [Ox] Hey, Deac, my lunch. - [Man In Cell] Hey, man, don't eat the fucking key. - [Man In Cell] We'll cut that key out of your fat gut. - Son of a bitch. - [Ox] Delicious (laughs). - Porter! - [Deacon] Stay out of it, Marsh. (slow riveting music) - [Bartlett] Guess you know how to throw a welcome party. (all laugh) - Woo hoo! - [Ox] All right, we got that Jack Daniels. All right. - [Spencer] Woo, yeah! - Hey, have a little Jack Daniels there, buddy. Good to see ya, how ya been, huh? - [Bartlett] Thanks, brother. - I knew you'd make it. - Been on ya, huh? Looks like they got you going there a little, huh? Pretty good lookin', huh? - I just got the crap beat outta me. (all laugh) - No prob, good to see you. What the fuck, you know? - Good to see you too, man. Good to see you too. - [Ox] Ooh, you sweetie, mm. (metal scrapes and clangs) - [Carey] Let's nail that son of a bitch. - [Audrey] Reese get your goddamn hands off me! You pig, let me go! - So you ride at his side, huh? Throw her in the car. - [Audrey] Carey, get your goddamn mercenaries off me. - [Carey] She's gonna take us to see her boyfriend. - [Audrey] Goddammit! - Blow it! (car tires screech) (weapon fires) (explosion booms) - All right, let's go. - Go in! - [Man] Come on, get it in gear, move out. - [Man] Let's take care of these shits, come on let's shoot 'em, let's go. - [Man In Hat] Come on, let's get these jerks. - Come on. - Yeah. (slow uneasy music) - Reese, move out over there. The rest of you, follow me. (explosion booms) (tense dramatic music) (weapons fire) - [Bartlett] Scramble or we'll never make it. - Blow the son of a bitch up, Spence. - Move out! - Let's go! - They can't get far. Take the boys, track 'em. Reese, no prisoners. - [Reese] Let's go, guys. (tense dramatic music) Okay, let's go. Come on. - [Man In Hat] Come on, get the goddamn lead out. (men grunt and groan) (weapon fires) (Ox yells) - You, okay? - Yeah, just a little rusty. - [Clay] Where's Carey? - [Man In Hat] Inside. (men laugh) - Carey. - Get her inside. - [Man] Come on, come on. - You and Porter can blow yourselves up all I care, but you let her go. - You're pressing your luck. - Hey, this stuff's gonna stop right here. I'm bringing in the state police. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. - I mean it. - So do I. Reese. (tense dramatic music) (weapons fire) - Boys, let's get him backed up. - [Man] Get the fuck outta here! - [Man] Who the? - Thanks. - Save it, sheriff. - [Reese] Delta one, do you read me? Come in, this is Delta four. Delta one, come in, do you read me? - [Man in White] They got at least four of my men. They're all over the place. - [Man In Hat] (coughs) Forget it man, these guys are too good, let's get outta here. - No, we regroup and hit 'em again tonight. I'll call for more of the guys. (mid-tempo gripping music) (whistles) (grunting) (man in hat groans) (weapons fire) (men scream) - [Man In Tree] Hey, hey, help me! Don't leave me, let me go and help, ah! - Hey, I don't expect you to believe me. I want that viper as much as you do. - We don't need this dickhead, shoot him. - Hey, bog brain, you're not gonna shoot anybody. I know of another way in there. - Ox. - You guys go barging in there, Audrey's gonna be the first one to get it. I know Carey's escape route. You'll never find it. You gotta take me along. - All right, sheriff, deal. But you make one move to cross me, I'll blow your fucking head off. (tense dramatic music) (metal clanks) - Shh! - All right, Ox, there's your field. You torch it. You guys see the fire, blow the bridge. - What if you're not back yet? - You blow it. - Okay. - Hey, Ox! That weed starts to burn, don't breathe too deep, huh? - [Ox] (inhales) All right, biggest joint in the world (laughs)! (tense dramatic music) ♪ A hunting we will go (vocalizes) Oh, baby, the ganja (laughs) Ooh, yeah (laughs), delicious. - You might need this, Marsh. (Ox yells) (weapons fire) - Mwah, stay right there (laughs). Smoke, all we need is a little match. Beep (laughs). (alarm blares) (tense dramatic music) (men chatter) - [Man] What is it? - The outfield's been torched. The field's on fire. - Shotgun, get it right. Alert the outposts, nobody in, nobody out. - [Man On Right] Come on, Henley. - [Spencer] That's one. - [Man] All right, let's go, come on. - [Man] Come on, let's go get 'em. - [Man] Come on let's go. - [Bartlett] Come on.
