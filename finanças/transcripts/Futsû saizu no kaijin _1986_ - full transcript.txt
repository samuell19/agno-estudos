What's up? I've been feeling strange lately... I didn't tell anybody... But... my body is strange. A monster, see? It's like I'm changing into a monster. A steel monster. Sorry. So the sexual murders happening around here... was they your fault? Have such things been happening? Ah, the moon is so beautiful What's happening to you? You did it again, didn't you? Dropping the phone won't be of any use! I know everything about you! So you can't run away from me! Die, you monster of steel! Come fucking out, wherever you are! All OK? Aren't you Tsukatani? It's been a while... May I know what's happening? After possessing that woman and then being approached by you... I was happy. And when you killed me, I almost had an orgasm. That woman, passing by chance near you as she walked down the road... ...that woman was out of luck, wasn't she? And about your girlfriend... that wasn't me. You did it! She was a good little sweetheart though... wasn't she? How did you get such a power? After the car crash, while you was lying in your hospital bed... did something happen? They are slivers. Slivers? The specks flying all around me, during the crash... ...big slivers from the car, into my neck... ...slivers so small the naked eyes can't see them, they penetrated into my brain. Blood clotted around those scraps. If they had exploded, I would now be a vegetable. To compensate for that fear, extraordinary powers were given to my brain. Thanks to the metallic cells born in my brain, I'm able to keep an eye on you. I'm sorry but I have to say it... you're really annoying me! You can't fight me! Because the one who gave you your extraordinary power... ...that one was me! What are you talking about? One just have to look to your body to understand. ...you got your telepathy from the metallic cells. Good, I see. If this is the way the things are, I'll give you the lesson you deserve! I... I... I dare you! Here... soon, thanks to our love, the world will be fire and brimstone. TOTAL MASSACRE!
