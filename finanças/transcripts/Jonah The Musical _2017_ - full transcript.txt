[orchestral music plays] [orchestral music continues] [female narrator] once there was a boy named Jonah, who always tried to do what was right. He honored his father, his monther, his grandparents, And he did his best to tolerate his little sister. Jonah knew the scriptures better than all his friends. And every Sabbath, he would go with his father to Synagogue. Jonah was a good boy. But when it came to playing with other children... Jonah had a hard time. Running made his chest hurt. He tried to swim once, but swallowed a lot of water, and almost drowned. But he was good at keeping score. So the children let him do that. But most of the time, Jonah spent his days alone, talking to God. And then one day, God talked to him! I shall restore Israels borders! God had given him good news for his nation! And now Jonah became a famous prophet! A hero. Every year they had a festival to celebrate Jonah's prophecy. Life for Jonah was good. Except for one thing... Nineveh. The most powerful nation in the world, terrorized Jonah's people with brutal surprise attacks. During one of those attacks, Jonah's father, Amitai, was killed by those merciless Ninevites. Jonah lost his best friend. But as his father would have wanted, {end-italic} Jonah continued to serve the Lord. And became an expert in God's law. Teaching others who believed the same way he did, about God. And then one day... God spoke to him again. - [Middle Eastern music plays] - [children laughing] [all] He is coming! The prophet's here! [indistinct chatter] ♪ Here he comes The prophet of God! ♪ Leave all behind It's almost time ♪ Come and see the prophet of God ♪ We've been waiting for this day! [indistinct chatter] - [woman] There he is! - [woman 2] Jonah! ♪ Hail to Jonah Prophet of God ♪ Let us rejoice Lift up your voice ♪ Sing to Jonah Prophet of God ♪ Let us rejoice ♪ This day! a' - Can you put me down? Thank you. [all laughing] Jonah, Jonah, don't be so humble. Seventeen years ago today, you prophesied that Israel's borders would be restored, and they were! [all cheering] As a result, we are a safer, more prosperous people! Well, why the Lord chose to speak through me, I do not know. But what I do know, is there are no greater people on earth, - than the children of Israel. - [all shouting] And today the village of Gath-hepher honors her favorite son with this! [all gasping] - Who is that? - [all] Huh? It's you! ' [Cheering] [man laughs] "Who is that?" Thank you. Thank you for... that. But as I have preached and taught for many years now, it is the Lord we worship, for He alone deserves all the glory and the praise. [crowd murmuring] Jonah, has the Lord given you a new word for us? [all] Oh! No. No, He hasn't. Now if you'll excuse me... But the king will be arriving soon to honor you! He needs to finish his speech for the king's arrival. Oh, yes, I understand. - Thank you... Ah! Oh... - Congratulations! Your Jonah must be so excited about the king's coming! Oh, yes, he's upstairs getting ready even as we speak. [chuckles] I have no idea what your brother is doing up there. - He keeps hiding in that room of his. - I know. He's not eating or sleeping. Something's going on. A mother knows! - I'll go talk to him. - Good. But don't tell him I told you. - OK. - All right. [Jonah singing in Hebrew] ♪ Blessed are You O Lord ♪ Who has chosen us from among all people - ♪ And exalted us... - [knocking] ♪ And exalted us above every nation [knocking] - What? - Shalom, Jonah! [Chuckles] "She who blesses her brother with a loud voice in the morning shall be counted as a curse." That's Proverbs 27 Verse 14. But as Moses said, "The Lord has turned the curse into a blessing." So why is the blessing in my room? Mama's very worried about you. How is that different from every other day of my life? Channah! Channah, come on! Don't touch my things! Everything is exactly where I want it to be. - Including you? - What do you mean by that? Well, sometimes when I'm hurt or afraid, I just want to run and hide. Hm. May I suggest your room instead of mine. [laughs] Jonah... All right, what do you think I'm hiding from? Seventeen years of silence? You feel like God's forgotten you. - Um... - But you know what amazes me? Your faith in Him has never wavered. - Oh, that's not... - You're my hero, Jonah. And you've had God Himself talk to you. - Well... - What is that like? Oh... It's like a cool, gentle breeze, in the heat of the day. And if you're not still, you'll miss it. [Chuckles] That is why I always write things down on my... my scroll. My scroll? Now you've lost my scroll! You mean this? You know, you have a greater purpose on this earth than to torment your brother. But nothing else is as much fun. Shalom! Shalom... Leave me alone, shalom! Shalom! I brought you some bread and milk. Oh, that statue makes you look so majestic. It's a graven image, and it should be destroyed. Besides it looks nothing like me. It's our people's way of celebrating the prophecy the Lord gave you. I don't want to celebrate what God did in the past. - What? - I want to experience Him today. That's why you're so special, because you love Him, Jonah, more than you do yourself. Just like your father. He always told me, "Rivka, the Lord has a special purpose for Jonah", because God knows there's not much else that boy can do." Please, I would like to be alone. Oh, my Jonah, ever since your father died, you always want to be alone. Well, all right, but today is a celebration, not a funeral, so I brought these clothes for you to wear, and the ring the king gave you for being a prophet of God. This is a big day for everyone, so keep it moving. And don't forget the bread and milk. [moans] Lord, I thank you for the women in my life. And I thank you that I'm a bachelor. [Chuckles] Oh, I need some fresh air. [Rivka] How was Jonah with you? [Channah] Mama, he doesn't understand what God is doing. - [Rivka] Mm-hm. - I wish I could help him. He needs to learn to trust the Lord, even when he doesn't understand. [gasps] I'll make him something to eat. [sighs] [moans] "Trust in the Lord with all your heart" and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, "and He shall direct your path." That's good. [whispering voice] Jonah. Yes, Mother. [whispering voice] Jonah. Lord? Lord... here I am! [whispering voice] Jonah, arise. Go to Nineveh and cry against it, for their wickedness has come up before Me... You're... you're going to bring judgment upon Nineveh? [laughs] O Bless you, Lord God Almighty!

Did the Lord speak to you? What? Have you been listening all this time? What? No! - I'm in my kitchen, cooking for you. - [Jonah] Is that right? - Now why would I be listening? - [Jonah] Fine. What do you mean, "Arise and go"? - Mother! - He spoke to you, didn't He? - Well, uh, yes. - And it's good news, isn't it? - Oh, it's very good news! - [Rivka laughs] - I knew it! Oh, bless the Lord! - Thank you, Lord. Oh, I love you so much, my little Jonah, my simcha! Mother, come on, please. Look, I need to write this down. Yes. Good. Write it down. I'm going. Mother... Mother? Hey! Now, I need to share this at the proper time! Promise me you won't tell anyone about this. I will! I mean, I won't! [laughs] [woman] What's going on? Nothing. Jonah told me not to say anything. Fine, I only brought you into this world. Why tell me? Oh, all right, Mother, but you can't say anything. Our Jonah... has another prophecy from the Lord. - [both screaming] - Another prophecy! Bless the Lord! Hallelujah! Mother... no one can know about this new prophecy. - Oh! My lips shall be like the Red Sea. - What? Only God could part them. Good. I need to go to market. Bless the Lord! Good news! Very good news! - My wife, what's going on? - [laughing] You haven't moved like this in 2O years. [Chuckles] Jonah has another prophecy from the Lord. What? How do you know? Well, because he told Rivka and Rivka told me. - But don't you tell anyone. - Oh! Another prophecy! And on the anniversary of the first one. [Laughs] Wait till the elders hear about this. [Jonah] Oh, I need to write this down. But I am so full of joy. Oh... I love you, Lord. I worship you. [singing in Hebrew] [man] Well, it must be true. I heard from Reuben who overheard Sabba Ephrum telling Elder Joseph, but don't say anything. Yes, I'm telling the truth, another prophecy! Moishe told Miriam, who told Tsalmon, and of course he told me, but don't tell anyone else. Ladies! Ladies, no one knows so don't say a word, but I just heard that the Lord is speaking great blessing to Israel again through Gath-hepher's own Jonah! [all screaming, chattering] ♪ Hal-la-la-la-lelujah! ♪ Hal-la-la-la-lelujah! a' Oh, thank you. I need to write this down. Whoo! The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amitai. Arise... yes. Go to Nineveh... yes. And cry against it. Cry? Now, why? [Laughs] If I cry out to them of what's to come, then... [gasping] You want to deliver them, don't You? No, Lord! No, look. Ninevites are merciless, violent. They hate You, and Your people! Human life, it means nothing to them. They slay women, and... and children... and my father. And you want me to go and cry, plead for them to be saved? ♪ Hal-la-la-la-lelujah! ♪ Hal-la-la-la-lelujah! a' I'll be known as a traitor. My reputation as a prophet... destroyed. I would shame my father's name. No, no. I can't write this down. No, no. I can't write this down. I can't let anyone know about this. Lord, now, I know that Your Scriptures declare. You are gracious and compassionate. You're slow to anger, abounding in mercy to every generation, but these people do not deserve mercy, and they are not worth saving. [cheering] [Jonah] What is going on out there?! [woman] God bless King Jeroboam! [all chattering] [laughing] Oh, I've come to celebrate what God has spoken through Jonah in the past... - [crowd murmuring] - but now I hear he has a new prophecy that is even better than the old one. [all laughing, chattering] Oh, I can still remember that day when this odd-looking, nervous young man, came to see me with a "word from the Lord." - [laughs] - That was my son. And unlike some of our doom-and-gloom prophets, like Amos and Hosea, Jonah brings good news for Israel! [all laughing, cheering] [chanting] Jonah! Jonah! Jonah! - Quiet, quiet, quiet! - [chanting stops] Now, it's time we hear from Israel's greatest prophet, my grandson, Jonah!

One shekel will buy you more than enough. - I don't have any money. - I don't understand. Look, I'm very hungry, and as a fellow Israelite, I thought you might give me something to eat. - Because you're an Israelite? - Yeah. Uh-uh. Come here. All right. Now you can't tell this to anyone, but I'm also the prophet Jonah. [chuckles] So... And I'm Moses. - Thou shall not lie. - Hey! I'm your countryman, don't I deserve mercy? Sir, no one deserves mercy. It is a gift, it cannot be earned. Now, though you are hungry, I don't think you're quite hungry enough yet. Not hungry enough? I have fasted more meals than you've eaten! And looking at you, that's quite a few meals. [Chuckles] What? Oh... Why is everything so difficult? OK. - Oh, boy. - Stop. - Stop! Stop! Stop! - [panting] Stop! In the name of King Jeroboam. I'm stopping! I'll do whatever you ask. Thank you. We just want to know if any of you have seen that man, the prophet Jonah? - [all] No. - [Soldier] Hm? Very well. Be on the lookout for him. He has an important message for the king. Now, wait a minute. Are you sure that the prophet Jonah looks just like that? What? Oh... Well, [chuckles] not exactly. Actually, he's kind of hunched over, with beady eyes... kind of like him. - Jonah? - Oh! Moses?! No! [screaming] [man laughing] Excuse me, may I ask where you are going? You may ask. Well, I'm asking, where are you going? - Who knows? [Laughs] - What? - You don't know where you're going? - We are children of the wind. Where it blows, we go. So where's the wind blowing you?

No, I just talked to the king's soldiers! They're looking for the prophet Jonah! He disappeared with an important message from the Lord. Who's Jonah? Oh, he's the prophet that rode up in the chariot of fire! No, no, that was Elijah. Yeah, Jonah told that man with leprosy to jump in the river seven times. [Jonah] No! That was Elisha! Jonah isn't anything like those prophets. Yeah, Papa told me Jonah only had one prophecy from the Lord, and that was a really long time ago. Well, the Lord has spoken to him again, that's why he's disappeared. - Why would a prophet run from God? - He has very good reasons. - How do you know? - Because I'm him! [gasping] - You're Jonah?! - Go get the soldiers! [Jonah] No, no, no! No, stop! - One, two, three, four, five... - [laughing] Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. [Chuckles] Where are you going? [Jonah] Well, I'm looking for everyone. No, you're not. You're leaving. - I need to. - But you can't run away and let people keep hiding. You have to go find them. If you don't, they'll stay lost. I'm sorry, but I have to go. [woman] Why do they have to run everywhere? [Channah] Mama, please! I really think you need - to slow down! - We're so close. I know it. [Rivka] I know Jonah.

Yeah, "You destroyed them like the ships of Tarshish" - "shattered by the east wind?" - [shouting] Quiet! Are you trying to ruin my business? - No. - Well, get out of here. - Destination. - No, no, no... Stop! - I'm going to Tarshish. - [all groan] Fine. Here. - I was here first. - I don't care. So which boat? - Which boat is it? - That one. [Jonah] That one? Oh, no. No, I can't take that. It's too small, there's too much water around it. Don't you have anything bigger? [all shouting] Apollo! Icarus! Get that cargo onboard! Before sundown, we're sailing for Tarshish. Oh! Uh... That's the one. One ticket for the big boat, please. - That will be 13 pieces of gold. - Oh, yeah, I don't have any money. - What? - Oh, no! Get him out of here! And don't you ever come back. Where are we going? [Yells] [laughter] Hey, what's the matter with you? Are you seasick or drunk? - Look, I don't drink. - What? I just need someone to help me get on that boat to Tarshish. - But I don't have any money. - Oh! - That is our ship. - He's right. - Oh, it is? - Yeah, come. - We will find a way to get you onboard. - You will? - No problem! - Let's drink on it. [all yell] - No, no. I don't... Oh, all right. - Captain! This man cannot pay for his fare. Drink up! So you're the captain of that big boat? - Drink, drink, drink! - The finest vessel there is. - Demon of the Sea! - What are you doing? - Why are you wasting it? - I'm doing things I never thought - I would do. - Ah, you'll get used to it. - You're one of us now. [Laughs] - No. No, I don't think I'm one of you. That's an expensive ring you have. That would get you onboard. My ring? Oh, no. No, now this was given to me for being a prophet of God. - I could never part with this. - Well, that's your decision. But this journey is going to cost you something. There are no free rides. But in Tarshish, even a prophet of God can be whoever he wants to be. [laughs] - [Rivka] There he is, Jonah! My Jonah! - Mother? - [Rivka] Thank the Lord. - [laughter] I found him! Papa! Mama! Channah! He's over here! - Why, Lord, why?! - Oh, my simcha! I thought I'd lost you! You're wearing this? With a bottle in your hand and smelling of wine? - You are coming home with us right now! - No, I am not coming home, Mother. Jonah ben Amitai, you need to stop this! I can't. You don't know what I'm going through. I know that whatever the Lord told you, you don't want to do. - He's asking too much of me. - Oh, Jonah. I know you. You like everything nice and neat and in its place. But God doesn't always work that way. Especially when people are involved. - So why not just get rid of the people? - Simcha! Trust Him, He loves you. - I know He does. - You know it here. But you don't trust it here. And you won't stop running until you do. My grandson! We thought we'd never find you. If it hadn't been for this kind, old man... I never saw someone so hard of hearing. I thought the yelling would never end. - Jonah, what happened to you? - I don't wanna talk about it. We have looked everywhere for you, not knowing if you're dead or alive. - Now, we deserve an explanation! - [all chattering] - Well, I'd like one too! - All right. Now, maybe you can explain this to me. Proverbs 24:12 declares, "The Lord shall render to every man" "according to his works," meaning if you do what is right, you'll be blessed, and if you do what is wrong, you'll be judged. Now, this is simple. Good and just, black and white, you reap what you sow. - I have lived my life by this law. - Oh! I love to listen to him preach. - Not now, Rivka. - But then, then the Lord speaks to me and says he wants to have mercy on a whole nation of people whose every thought is evil. Every deed selfish. Cruel, no, profane. And he wants me to be the messenger. Well, I'm not going to Nineveh! [all gasp] - God wants to have mercy on Nineveh? - Yes. - And He wants you to tell them? - Yes. Uh... And that is why I am trying to go to Tarshish. Oh... He needs a one-way ticket to Tarshish. - [all chattering] - All right! - Never mind. - So now you know. You're going on a boat in the ocean, surrounded by water? Oh! He really has lost his mind. All I ask is that you please just... just let me be. This is between me and God. I understand. I'd want to run too. - They took my father's life, Sabba. - Yes. But they could not take his faith, and his trust in God, Jonah. Don't let them take yours. Demon of the Sea, now setting sail for Tarshish. Come here. Here's bread, cheese and fruit. - At least you won't starve. - Thank you. [Channah sniffling] Channah. Oh, Channah, come on, please.

What do you see out there? - Where did those clouds come from? - The skies have been clear all night. [thunder crashes] - Oh! - All hands on deck! - Every man to his station! - She's coming in, hurry up! [captain] What's happening up here? [man] Captain, I've never seen anything like it. - This storm appeared out of nowhere! - Steersman! What are you doing? Turn the ship around! You have her heading west! - But the wind, it's from the west! - That's impossible! The wind always blows from the east here! Captain, you know I'm not a religious man, but there is something unnatural about this storm. - The hands of the gods are in this! - [man] We're taking on water! Lighten the ship! Throw the heavy cargo overboard! No, you can't throw the cargo overboard, that's our wages! - You'll do what I tell you! - [grunts] This storm is like nothing I've ever seen before. The hands of the gods are in this, and if they don't help us, none of us will survive! I want every man crying out to his god for mercy! Now! [thunder crashes] [man] God of the high seas, do not let us die this night. For only you can control our path. Where's the prophet? We need his prayers up here! He's down below, sir! Down below! [all shouting] - Prophet! Prophet, wake up! - I'll wake you up! Ah! "[Grunts]" Water, water! What's happening? How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he'll listen to you and spare us. - I can't. - What do you mean you can't? I've turned my back on Him, I can't help you. But you have to, you're the only religious man among us. Captain, we've been casting lots to find the cause of this storm, and the lot continues to fall to him! - Me? - [captain] That can't be right, this man's a prophet. Cast them again. [Jonah] Am I the cause of this storm? Is this the result of all of my running? Will all of these men die because of me? - It's him! - It's me, it's because of me! Who are you, prophet, what people are you from? I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord God of Heaven, who made the land and the sea. - Is your God causing this storm? - Yes. - [all shout] - What can we do to make it stop? - Throw me into the sea. - What? My disobedience has caused this storm. - And if you throw me in, it will cease. - Are you crazy? I can't do that. You will all have to pay for your sins, you should not have to pay for mine. To the oars, all of you, and row, row for your lives! Why don't you just do what your God wants you to do?! He doesn't need me. He can send somebody else. But there must be some reason why He wants you to go. - It doesn't matter anymore! - But you're going to die! I have nothing to live for now. - I said back to your oars! - No! [captain roars] [thunder crashes] [captain] Keep rowing, men! Row! Row! No! No! - [man grunts] - Captain! Captain, we can't make it! The ship is breaking apart! Captain, don't let these men die because of me! [man shouts] Throw me in! Throw the prophet overboard! O God of Jonah, do not let us die for taking this man's life. Let us not be found guilty for killing an innocent man, for You, O God, have done as You pleased. [all shouting] [man gasps] He was right. The prophet's God calmed the storm! I never knew a God like this was real. I don't know what to do. I don't either. But a God with this much power, I'd be a fool not to serve Him.

I'm breathing. I'm alive. I'm alive! [Laughs] Why is it so dark? Oh, no. I'm not alive... I'm dead! This is where my disobedience has brought me, to my grave, to the depths of hell! Oh... Why is it so wet? Whoa! Oh! What's happening? Oh! Everything's moving! Oh! [groans] Oh! Oh, my ears feel like they're going to burst! [sniffing] Oh! And the smell of death is like rotting fish.

Oh! - [whale groans] The call of the naswhallim! I'm inside an enormous fish?! [screams] [whale singing] Oh! My head aches. My skin, it's burning. Why? Why did I continue to run?

[sobbing] [whale singing] No one will ever believe this. How does a man spend three days and nights in the belly of a fish, and live? Oh... It's impossible. Except for the Lord. You did not bring me here to die. You wanted to save me! When I sank down to the depths, buried beneath Your waves, my last breath... You snatched me from the jaws of death! And when I had lost all hope, and I turned to You again, You... You heard my cry! O Lord my God, I... I give You my life, I'll do whatever You ask, for salvation is from the Lord!

Oh, I make a joyful noise. What are you holding? I found this in Jonah's room. It's the prophecy the Lord gave to him. Channah, you know better than to look through your brother's belongings! What does it say? It says, "The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amitai", arise, go to Nineveh, and cry." - It stops there. - Cry... Hm... I don't remember ever seeing Jonah cry, Mama. Not after your father died. It's like all the color went out of his life. He'd tell me he was fine, but a mother knows. But how could his heart become so hard? No one knows the Scriptures better than Jonah. Oh, dear, one's selfishness and pride are like weeds that never stop growing. Maybe he got tired of pulling them out. All of us are broken creations of clay that the Lord wants to restore, so that we can walk with Him, and not run from Him. And for that to happen, we need to pray! Yes, as King David said, "lf we seek Him, we will find Him." - First Chronicles, Chapter 19. - Actually, it's Chapter 28. Fine, it's still David talking. There are storehouses of blessings that only prayer can open. And the most powerful prayers are prayed together. We come before you, Lord, on behalf of our beloved Jonah. Turn his heart to You again. Have mercy. Speak to him, I pray. [singing in Hebrew] Oh! Oh... Well, there it is. Nineveh. Oh, that is the biggest wall I have ever seen. With thousands of worthless, violent people on the inside. But I have vowed to obey You. [chuckles] I don't like it, but I will obey. Come on. - [man] No! - Oh, no, come on! [man] No, please! I beg you! - [soldier] Shut your mouth! - [man] No! Gatekeeper!

[yelling] I hate these people! There's nothing good in them. They're worse than wild dogs. I can't... Oh... I can't do this. Forty more days, and Nineveh will be destroyed. Forty more... Will be?

I'll move on to another part of your city. Wait! Who gave you this message? This message... Oh! Was given to me... by the Holy One of Israel, who knows the deeds of every nation, and the secrets of every heart. Now, the wickedness of this city has long come before Him, and your time of judgment is at hand! He's a Hebrew, one of those people of the law. Now, he can learn a new law! Bow to Nineveh! [all shouting] [soldier] Take him away! He's telling the truth! What? - What did you say? - This man speaks the truth. - How would you know that? - Priest! Why would this man's God warn us of coming destruction? He's offering us... mercy. Mercy?! [Spits] - Mercy is weakness! - No. Only the strongest man is able to show mercy, for He alone has the power to give and to take away. No, no, no! Gatekeeper, I've seen you take the lives of countless Israelites! - [all shouting] - And this God... has seen me too. This burning in my heart confirms it. Yet this man has come, offering hope!

Well, my people's response to your preaching of coming judgment - is of great concern to me. - Yes, it concerns me as well. But what concerns me most... is the truth. I rule the largest kingdom this world has ever seen. Nineveh is feared by all! We are a nation... on the brink of collapse. Political betrayals are rampant. The Urartu mountain tribes of the north, Babylon to the south, all wage costly revolts against us. My treasury is depleted, my cities in disrepair, my army, mutinous. We have endured two deadly plagues in five years. For months, my priests have been sacrificing to every known god, hoping to appease the one that afflicts us. And only one has answered. Only one God has come to us. Yours. [chuckles] Thank you for coming to us. Anything you want, my servants will provide. But now, I must repent with my people in sackcloth and ashes. I can’t believe this. I can’t believe this is happening. Prophet, would you teach me about your God? I need to preach to the rest of your city.

Why are You doing this to me? How could it get any worse? [wind blowing] [suspenseful music playing] I can’t take any more. You destroy my plant, but you won’t destroy that city. It’s better for me to die than to live. Do you have a right to be angry about the plant? Yes. Yes, I do. I am angry enough to die! Why do you care so much about this plant? You did not create it or cause it to grow. It was a shelter and comfort to me. Nineveh is a shelter and comfort to more than 120,000 people, and many animals as well. Should that city not be loved as you loved that plant? That is not the same. Now, look, I’ve obeyed the Lord from my youth. Obedience brings blessing, but it does not earn love. I have done everything He asked. You haven’t stopped running. What do you mean? I delivered the message. You spoke the truth. But not in love. But... love costs so much. And it’s messy. People take forever to change, if they change at all. They take one step forward, then it’s two steps back. It’s the rest of us who suffer as they continually drain your time, energy, money...
