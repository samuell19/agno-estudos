Not even walls Can stop Our desire To fly The future Depends on the present Only on that My inner strength doesn't go to the gym My character wasn't photoshopped My creativity reaches the space And I already put a stop to my ego I am fire In the dark I have Dreams of freedom THE LEAST EXPECTED HOUR Sir. -Why is there such a small audience? - It's the usual crowd. Did you make sure they're alive at least? I can't go on like this. People, today's a very special day, so I'll need all your energy! Let's try a round of applause. Bravo! Jimmy! Thanks. Thank you so much. Thanks. Many women joined us here today. I love that. I confess I am an unconditional admirer of them all. And I thank them for being an infinite source of inspiration for me. In fact, I think Jesus Christ should have been a woman. Had Jesus Christ been a woman, the complete quote would go, "Lazarus, get up… but first, make your bed." Had Moses been a woman, think about it for a moment, the plagues of Egypt would have been… split ends, double chin, crow's feet, stretch marks… What a jerk! …mastitis, and cellulite. We would have commandments such as "Sanctify sweet sixteen parties"… and "Don't leave the toilet seat wet." And in Holy Week, we'd watch the movie Noelle's Ark. Women. Queens of creativity. - Inspirational muses. - Are you in love? But for centuries, they've been incapable of making up a different excuse from… "I have a headache." She was so flat her breasts were declared Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Much better. Implants came to give women a hand. Because a woman who wants to do great things has to have "great things" done. We came to see Jimmy. He's excellent. That man's so cheeky. All right, Jimmy! Any message for the boss? Jimmy won't do the performance. The boss won't like to hear that. I think you should invite him in a different way. How would that be? THE MOST EXPECTED GUEST Today, the most expected guest is presidential candidate Maritza Lopera. Welcome! All right, Dr. Lopera, anything to say to those who argue that the presidency of this country would be out of your league? I've been acknowledged as the best senator for four terms. That speaks highly of my efficiency and capability. Times change, Jimmy. We women are now taking the most important offices. That's true. We won't argue about that. Women belong in the top offices of the world. To sweep them, I mean. Has anybody ever told you your sense of humor can be pretty unpleasant? Has anybody ever told you there's something called satire? Yes. But there's satire, and there's boorishness. Doctor… Lopera. Ma…? Mari…? Maritza? - Maritza. - Yes. Maritza Lopera. I wonder whether, without hoisting the flag of gender equality, which is another kind of demagogy and populism, you would've managed to get where you are right now. - Surely… - The answer, right after commercials. Very good. That was excellent, Mr. Jimmy, congrats. Here's my niece's résumé. She wants to do her internship with us. You'll hand over your position to your niece? - No, the idea is... - Manu. I have enough with you on the team. I don't need more women. Jimmy. The show was awesome. The best rating in months. We'll have to invite that woman again. - I don't think she'll accept. - I hope she won't report me. Nowadays you can't even flirt with women. There's a lady who wants to talk to you. She says her little sister is ill. No. Just give her a signed picture. Hello? How are you? He's got a super important appointment. He cannot see you. But he sends you a signed picture for your little sister. What if I see him quickly before his appointment? No, that'll be impossible, he's got an interview. Right. You don't believe me. - You think what I said about my sister... - Is made up. It's always the same with people. They tell you their sister is ill, their grandma is dying… and the bank account number so I can transfer money to them. You should be more creative. "Be more creative"? And you should take your own advice. Your routines against women are boring and repetitive. They're not against women, but about women. Your sister can explain the difference to you. Yes, sure. I can understand that my sister likes your humor. She has just turned 14. - Hello, young lady. - Hello, Lili. Did you meet Jimmy? Did he say anything? When is he coming? Okay, one question at a time. Oh, no. Darling, bad news. The person who was going to help me get in the station had an issue today and didn't go to work. I wanted Jimmy to come by tomorrow. I know. Let's have faith it'll happen next week. Okay? Yes. Give me a little smile. A little smile… "Be more creative"? You should take your own advice. Your routines against women are boring and repetitive. Who's that beast? Gosh, we're dead. - Pablo, do something! - Freeze, don't move. Easy. We're unarmed. We get out of the car and you can take it. I said, "don't move." Hello. Who are you? No fan of yours, I can assure you. I'm here on behalf of Mr. Agustín Ortiz. Agustín Ortiz? The drug dealer? Agustín "the Wig" Ortiz? Some politicians call him… "the sponsor." The boss wants to see your show. I see you've turned down all his kind invitations so far. Bad idea. - I'm not in charge of hiring, but... - I've got news for you. The good news is the boss will no longer hire you directly. The bad news is… he hired me. - You're a comedian too? - Hands off! He hired me to bring you to him. And, unlike you, I never say no to my boss. Got it? I don't know my availability... We will set the date and time. Don't worry. The pay will be very good. Remember: For Saint Peter, you would perform for free. Just a little suggestion. Don't even think about going to the Police nor leaving the country in the next few days. I can see everything. And I can hold a grudge. I'll let you know the date and time of your show. By the way, I watched some of your rinky-dink TV show. Let me tell you, not all women are alike. Remember my name. Sizu. What worries me is they approached you on the street. That means they're watching you. I can see you're very nervous. Lend me your computer. I'll get you a plane ticket for tomorrow. A ticket? Where would I go? I don't know. Miami, New York, London, I don't know. - We're loaded with work, Adrián. - That's the least of your worries. You don't need a year off. Just a couple of weeks 'til everything calms down will be fine. And what about the TV show? Will you do it? I'll make something up. We'll produce a special… or an interview. I agree with not caving in to Agustín Ortiz's pressure, but that man's dangerous. I'M SIZU. What's this shit? Who's Sizu? COME TOMORROW AT 2:00 P.M., ALONE, TO THE SANTANDER BUILDING'S PARKING LOT. Santander? YES, SANTANDER. I know who I am I know where I come from, I know where I'm going to I'm on this crow's back And I hear the siren song today… - Oh, you were driving. No wonder. - What did you say? - Get in. There's no time. - I said nothing. I'll get right in. Gentlemen, how are you? What now? Let me guess. You'll blindfold me because I mustn't know where your boss is. No. I have something better for you. Ouch! He hit me. …I let them devour me I'll end up getting used to it Hoping to get on My crow's back again And I'll fly away I'll fly away I'll go through the smoke screen while I can I'll fly away Let me introduce you to Mr. Agustín Ortiz. Welcome, Mr. Barón. I'm very flattered you came willingly to perform for me. I admire you a lot, Jimmy. You're very funny. Thanks. Mr. Ortiz, two things. I won't charge you for my show. What? He won't charge for his show, sir. And the second one? For the trip back home, I'd prefer to be blindfolded. This will be the most special show of your life, Jimmy. You'll never forget it. Why? What's so special about it? Hello, sir. Where are you taking me? The star's dressing room. My last name goes with "B." - We'll correct it for your tombstone. - What? I'm kidding, man. Go in. You have everything here. Makeup, wigs, and all the clothes you'll need for your characterization. "Characterization"? The boss wants you to perform dressed as a woman. Since women are your favorite topic, you'll dress as a woman. - Nobody told me I'd... - I'll be back in 50 minutes. Don't make me dress you and do your makeup. I'm not very good at it. Got it? Makeup. Wigs. Damn you! Why are you quiet, you fool? Hands in the air! Freeze! Good evening. I'm prosecutor Liliana Navarro. I'm in charge of your case. I understand you didn't want to talk. It's not easy to be in your position. But relax, Mr. Barón. I know you. You do. We met at the TV station yesterday. You should've told me you were a prosecutor. He killed her in front of me. Point blank. He shot at me twice. Bang! And I managed to… I swear, I have nothing to do with it. I'm not involved in this shit. Look. I believe you. And I will help you. Right. What will you help me with? To get a life sentence? To get the electric chair? To be euthanized? - To get hanged...? - Shut up! Enough! Didn't you get it? I believe you and I will help you! Lieutenant? What do you mean? An undercover agent. Wig unmasked her. He tried to kill her and you witnessed everything. That puts you at risk. Can I ask you a favor? - I'm a victim here, too. - Oh, really? A victim? Then how do you explain the $50,000 credited to your bank account today? - What? - Yes. It seems you did get paid for your show. No, that money's not mine. I can give it back. - You must explain this. - What? It's very strange Mr. Jimmy Barón is considered a fugitive at the moment. But what's even stranger is the fact that $50,000 were credited to his personal bank account. This money came from an account linked to the mafia. However, we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. We'll wait until he shows up and makes a proper statement. At least I… won't play with a man's honor, like he does in his show. OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL What's with the men in black? They work in LA with the best film production companies. They're movie makeup and FX experts. That's the theory. What about the practice? They, with a little help from the National Civil Registry, will give you a new identity. Not even walls Can stop our desire To fly The future Depends on the present Only on that My inner strength doesn't go to the gym My character wasn't photoshopped My creativity reaches the space And I already put a stop to my ego… That's exactly why I'm here, but... People, listen up. Once again, I'm telling you, if Jimmy doesn't show up in a week, we'll refund the cost of your tickets in full. Where's Jimmy? - Why was he with Ortiz? - Thank you all for your attention. Paola, you look amazing. "Paola"? Mr. Agustín. Trust me, Jimmy hasn't reached me nor anyone else, not that I know of. That's weird. I understand you're his right hand. That's right. As soon as he gets in touch with me, you'll be the first to know, I swear. There's something I want you to understand. Besides cooperating with justice, this is your best chance to be safe. Wig Ortiz wants to kill a man, not a woman. I'd like to talk to my family. No. Wig has moles everywhere. You cannot trust anybody. At least let me talk to my assistant. Your assistant? Any message for the boss? Jimmy won't do his performance. The boss won't like to hear that. I think you should invite him in a different way. - That's where you can help. - How would that be? I don't know, giving him a scare on the street? In fact, it could be today. My own assistant sent that broad after me. So Adrián works for Agustín Ortiz? This is our only proof. Maybe he wanted you to perform for that man to earn his commission as your assistant. What a greedy rat! There's something else. Be ready to be treated like any other woman. Nobody will know who you are and you won't have any privileges. Liliana, why are you helping me? Why did you suggest this? I've already told you. I believe you're innocent. How's your sister doing? Fighting for her life… every single minute. But it doesn't matter. We'll make it through. No, like this. Hello, how are you? Hello, how are you? I love your hair! WOMEN'S PRISON This prison is my kingdom. My territory. Not a single leaf moves here without me knowing it. Look, the new girls are here. What did she bring in that big bag? What's that? My stuff. What's this? My makeup kit. My makeup kit! My makeup kit. What? My makeup kit. Do you think you came here for a beauty contest or what? No, madam, but... If you want to paint your face, you must buy lipstick in the prison commissary. - I don't have money to... - Everyone works here. That way, they can reduce their sentences and buy anything they need. This is not allowed. Nor this. Let's see… Nor this. Let's see. Nor this! I have asthma. The prescription's in there. What's this? It's for a mental disorder I have. The psychiatrist's prescription is in there too. Any questions? There's only one person per cell here, right? What's with this one? Yeah, right. And a balcony with an ocean view, 24-hour free Wi-Fi, Jacuzzi and spa! Hello. Nice to meet you. My name's Ángel. Welcome to prison. We have workshops in the wards. You can do craftwork. For instance, you can sew, embroider, and paint. The only thing that isn't considered prison work is digging a tunnel. Please, don't you ever arrive late to the count and formation. At lunchtime, you eat your avocado at the table. You cannot take it to use it for facial masks at night. We also have a PA system to promote social services and make announcements. This prison is very well equipped. The only thing we don't have is an emergency exit! You're so hot! Babe! Sexy thing! Ángel, leave that dish in my cell. You babe! She's so yummy. I'll take you to paradise tonight. Your bed or mine, honey? You sexy chocolate. Babe! Relax, they're the welcoming committee. This will be your cell. It's cozy and nice. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on you. Hello. I guess this is my space, right? Nice to meet you. I'm Paola. Speculations and versions abound, but the truth is Jimmy Barón is a fugitive for some and a missing person for others. LIVE - FUGITIVE OR MISSING PERSON? What's going on with Jimmy? Thank you all for worrying so much about Jimmy. Today, I have very sad news. We have to cancel the TV show for the first time in three years. We also had to cancel his theater shows. JIMMY, WHERE ARE YOU? So, Jimmy, if you're listening to me, please, brother, get in touch with us soon. Is it true Jimmy was giving a private show for Agustín Ortiz the day he disappeared? I know nothing about that, so excuse me, please. I hope Jimmy's fine. Excuse me, sir. -Yes, honey. - Your thoughts on Jimmy's disappearance? -Jimmy who? - Jimmy Barón, the comedian. Do you think he was kidnapped, he disappeared or this is just smoke and mirrors? Smoke? Oh, no, if he smoked, relax, he'll show up eventually. He'll be hungry, but he will show up. He must be chilling at a park. -Back to you. - Where's Jimmy, then? Jimmy! Are you okay? Who can be okay in this place? - It's not that bad in here. - Really? At least each of us have our own bed. I've been in worse places. Once I was in a prison with such narrow cells that I could feel my mate's colon getting inflamed and all. So… And don't cry so loud, or our neighbors will complain and call the manager, and we'll have to leave the apartment. And moving out at this late hour, with our stuff, our pets and our fleas will be a pain. You're crazy, aren't you? Maybe, but you're not crying anymore. Humor is an escape. Nice to meet you. I'm Valery. I'm Paola. Welcome. Thanks. To the showers, everybody! To the showers! Bayou Beast is yelling more and sleeping less every day. - How much is it? - It's 9,000 pesos. Darlings, I have lice killing shampoo if anyone needs it. Move, girl, they're waiting for us... What's up with you? Is that a chastity belt or what? I have a condition. Really? What's that? Dishabiliophobia. Relax, Pao. These are my friends. María Paz, Pepa, and Lourdes, the saleswoman. See, honey. I have sweets, lipsticks, nail polish, whatever... Enough, Lourdes. Dishawhat? Dishabiliophobia. Fear to get naked in public. How's that? You should've seen her. - Great body, great butt, great legs. - Not true. It's true, girl. I feel I have a manly body. No. It's all men's fault, with their materialism and everything. My husband used to tell me, when he saw me naked, that I was an optical disillusion. I'm happier here, serving my sentence. Did you kill your husband? So tell me, dear. If nobody can see you naked, how do you get a PAP smear? I've never had one done. - You could get cancer! - No way. Tell me. What about…? - How do you do it? I want to know. - Right. The lights are off or I'm half-dressed. That's not a good fuck. - Pepa! - It's true. Another day without news of the famous comedian Jimmy Barón. Now, one of his most recent performances in The Least Expected Hour. She was so flat her breasts were declared Intangible Heritage of Humanity. That guy is despicable. That's why we are this way. Every time I see him, I feel like kicking his butt. Right on, Lourdes. He's always making fun of women. Right! That asshole isn't funny. He's just pathetic. They don't go to a nudist beach because they feel people dress them with their eyes. Listen to that. See? He's making fun of your problem. I'll tell you one thing: If I run into that guy on the street, I'll get, I don't know… about 20… yes, another 20 years in here. You'll have to find him first, not even the cops know where he is. Who knows where that sweetie is? Oh, it's sweets day. What do you have? Guava jelly. Fine. Give me one. It's 2,000. Give me credit 'til the end of the month. But you pay me then, okay? I know it's hard at first, but try some. I'm a good observer. I see things nobody sees. You don't fool me. What do you mean? Since you got here, I've noticed you don't look like anybody else in this prison. Your moves, your gestures. I don't get what you're doing here. - You think so? - Yes, I do. Subtle. Smooth. Delicate. I must confess that, in the ten years I've been working here, I'd never wanted to ask an inmate out so badly. "Out"? Of prison? That was a good one. Oh, no. I'm not kidding, sweet pea. It's the truth. Anything you need, do not hesitate to let me know… cutie. He's crazy for you, right? What are you saying, you silly? "Silly"? You think I don't know what he's talking about? Glances exchanged here and there… What, are you also "laundryphobic"? Allow me, I'll show you. First, you wring it out a bit. See, this is soaking wet. Put some muscle into it. That's it. Otherwise, what will you use tomorrow, girl? That's it. Hey! Are you looking for him? - No! - No? Done. Come, let's go. Valery, how long have you been here? - About two years. - Two? And how long until you get out? Oh, what's the use of keeping count, girl? Four years. I had a super weird dream last night. I dreamed that a whole bunch of inmates escaped. Do you think it's a premonition? Sure it is! Only in your dreams could you get out of here. This prison is super secure. Listen. We'll have guests in our cell tonight. - Guests? - Yes. - How come? - "How come"? Once a month, Bayou Beast has a day off, so we pay a little something to the rest of the guards so we can let other inmates in our cell. We drink, talk, and fool around. We'll have some drinks. - I don't drink. - Oh, my. Look. They're coming to blows. One, two! I thought booze was forbidden here. It is forbidden. That's why it tastes better, right? That's why I sell it at a higher price, girl. What if we get caught? If we get caught, we'll go to jail! Come on! Relax, Bayou Beast isn't here tonight. Go ahead. - Go on. - One, two! We want to know more about you, Paola. - About me? - Why are you here? Yeah, come on. What did you do, girl? I'll tell you, but I want to listen to your stories. Go on. I don't like to talk about me very much, but… I'm here due to identity theft. "Dentity" theft? You stole teeth? You're so silly. No, I pretended to be somebody else. I wanted to claim an inheritance, but got caught while I was forging the signatures. What a fool. Come on. - Give her another one. - Oh, no. Lourdes, tell your story. He was 15 years younger than me. I fell head over heels for him. And he… messed with my head. He knew I was working in a very fancy house. And he told me that… we should steal from my bosses. And with that money… we would get married… and go on a honeymoon. I made a copy of the key. And we went there on a weekend while my bosses were away. He waited outside, he said he'd keep watch. I got in and took the lord's money, his luxury watches, the lady's jewelry… When I came out… he took everything and… fled. Who was caught on camera? Me. Who got sentenced? Me. Later, I found out… that he did go on a honeymoon. But with a girl his age. What happened to your man? - Never heard from him again. - Lourdes. Since then, I do my selling business myself. - What's up, Ramírez? - Here. - Thanks. - Anytime. Your turn, Pepa. Oh, no, girl. I've told this story many times. But not to me. Come on. A man called to offer me a job. Hello, Pepa? He said it'd be a walk in the park. I had to take care of an old man with Alzheimer's. I went to the interview. This man, the old man's son, welcomed me. He said, "Yeah, it's easy. You just have to feed him, give him his meds, look after him all day, and that's it." He paid good money. And the old man hardly ate anything, so… I ate his leftovers. Everything was fine. Everything ran smoothly. It was the job of my life. Until one day… the cops arrived. I didn't understand what was going on. As it turned out, the old man's son… was a crook. The bastard had him kidnapped. Of course, the cops didn't believe me. Because the old man didn't remember a thing… I told them I had nothing to do with that, and begged them to leave me out of that mess, but… they didn't care. They said I was the only culprit. I'm paying for a crime I didn't commit. One, two! - María Paz, your turn. - Right. Well… He beat me for no reason. Every time he arrived home drunk, the humiliation was awful. He beat me a lot. I told my mom I wanted to leave him, but my mom said, "You can't leave your husband. It's a sin. That's your cross to bear." One day, he arrived home… so wasted he couldn't even get up. He beat me to a pulp. So I waited, I waited until he fell asleep… and I did what I had to do. I called the cops myself. I told them I wasn't thinking straight, but the judge didn't buy I had postpartum depression. Well… I hadn't had a baby. That's the best part, right? Okay. I want to know your story, Valery. Nobody knows Valery's story. She's very reserved, she never tells anything. You're such a snitch. What happened to me was that… I got real sleepy. She's so boring. Same old same old! Girl, you're annoying. So what? Bye. Bye. Sleep tight. Valery, are you asleep? I think I had one too many. I really like your friends. It's nice to have friends in here. But why won't you talk about yourself? The deal was you'd all tell me why you were here. So tell me. Valery. Hey! I hope your lawyer will get you out of here as soon as possible. I hope so too, but it won't be easy. Next week, I'll bring my mommy on visiting day. I've told her a lot about you. About us. About how special you are. About our glances, our connection. "Connection"? Gosh! You're going to meet my mommy! No clue of Agustín Ortiz's whereabouts. That guy knows how to hide. We have to be very patient. Relax, don't worry about me. I'm not having such a bad time here. What about your cellmate? Have you learned anything about her? No. Valery is very secretive. Between us, I don't think she's the type of person who would take part in a jailbreak. I think that escape plan's a lie. Stop trusting your gut and trust the intelligence reports more. That woman is Wig's girlfriend. He's determined to get her out of here. But we don't know when or how. That's why anything you may find out will be really helpful to avoid her jailbreak. How's your sister? Not that good. Caro's not… responding to treatment as we expected. She'll be okay. Wait and see. Yes. Don't get all excited, darling, stay put. Pepa! Lourdes! - Let her go! - Lourdes! - Here are her chaperones! - Let her go! I'm sick of this fool. She thinks she's the queen of the yard. So what? What are you going to do? Hey, simmer down. Simmer down. You too. That's it. Let's calm down. You want to fight me? Let's fight then! Let's see, Pepa. Are you okay? Valery doesn't feel superior. - Yes, I do. - You don't. How could she? We're all the same here. Each one of us cope with our confinement as best we can. I don't know who bears the brunt of it all, but I know we're all alike. Take a look at yourselves, girls. - Look where we are. - Yes. We have enough with serving our time, people pointing their fingers at us, and dealing with our conscience to start judging and condemning each other too. - It's true. - There's no queen here. - But I am the queen! - Valery! What? We don't have to be best friends. But at least let's not make our burden harder or our days tougher. Is that impossible? Oh, no. Girl, how could you do that? Poor thing. Look at her, she was talking so nicely… My God. I thought you'd die on me. Where am I? In prison. I know, you fool, but where exactly am I? At the infirmary. Who hit you and why? Speak! Speak. You know I don't tolerate indiscipline in my prison. Those lowlifes almost break the curly girl's nose. No need for that. No need. - Here she is. How did it go? - What were you told at the infirmary? - Oh, what a pity! - Will you need surgery? No, come on. Pao, will you forgive me? You were punched because of me. It's okay. What did you say to Bayou Beast? You must've told her it was the Chief! I told her exactly what had happened. Well done. I said I slipped in the bathroom and hit my face, that was it. Here, honey. I got you something for your bruises. No, Lourdes, I have no money to buy that. Don't offend me, honey. It's a gift. What? Since when do you give away things? Take the chance, girl! It's just she moved me very much with her speech. Yeah. I really liked it, too. It seemed you had experience in public speaking and all. Yeah. I'm a jack-of-all-trades, dear. If you behave, I'll teach you to dance. - Really? - I love it. Yeah. I'm in! - This broad's so annoying. - What? Dimwit. - Careful. You threw that to her face. - No way. Look what they did to me. You know what? That was cool. It was cool of you not to rat me out to Bayou Beast. That was classy. We're good. Your friends and I are good, too. Paola! This is my mommy. Mommy, this is Paola. Come. Paolita. Mommy. Here we are. You can talk here without being disturbed. Talk about what, Ángel? Relax, Paolita, my mommy is wonderful. Right, Mommy? Bless me, Mommy. Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Excuse me. So what's your name? Paola. My name's Paola. Paola. I can't imagine how my only child can get involved with a person with a criminal background. We agree on that, madam. In fact, I... It is one thing when a man becomes a criminal. But a woman? That's really frowned upon. A woman must be at home, taking care of her husband and her children. Let's be clear: If you get pregnant while being locked up… that'll be your problem. I won't be raising children. Send them… to a reform school. Is that clear? Yes, madam, crystal clear. Did he really bring his mother to meet you? No way. I don't know who's crazier: the son or the mother. That means he's serious about you. Pao. - Don't you like him? Not even a bit? - No way! Okay, girl. Let's change the subject. Who visited you today? A relative? My cousin. Uh-huh, so? - So what? - Tell me more. Why won't you ever talk about yourself? If you don't trust me, if you don't like talking to me, just say it, and I'll ask Bayou Beast to move me. Bayou Beast! Do me a favor, move me to another cell. Hush, Paola. They'll end up actually moving you to another cell. I do trust you, but I have nothing interesting to tell. - My life's very boring. - Right. We'd better go to sleep. We have to get up early tomorrow. Yeah, right. You're dodging me. What's up? Not even walls Can stop Our desire To fly away The future Depends on the present Only on that My inner strength doesn't go to the gym My character wasn't photoshopped My creativity reaches the space And I already put a stop to my ego I haven't been using my inhaler lately. Since I'm here, I've forgotten I suffer from asthma. What about the mission? You've forgotten about it, too? That's the best part, right? No, I haven't forgotten it at all. In fact, it's always on my mind. As I said, Valery won't say a thing. I suffer in front of a glass of liquor Knowing I always lose at this game Since the kisses and caresses you gave me Are now memories of the past I suffer when I see That all the nice moments we lived Just slipped through our hands That I'm no longer your reason to be That you don't belong to me anymore… He's crazy for you, right? I understand she's very attractive. Maybe, for you, this is no longer a mission and turned into something else. Why do people abandon you When you're happiest and in love? Why does life have to be so cruel? Why does life have to be this way? Why do people leave your side Leaving you torn, making you feel you don't want to move on? Why? Why? Why? You're the best dancer I know. You're not bad yourself, girl. Once we get out of here, we'll be dancers. - Deal. - …further investigation. Every new operation to capture him is even more fruitless and ridiculous than the previous one. LIVE SENATOR The judiciary in this country is a sham, a joke. And the prosecutor in charge, Liliana Navarro… This case is too much for her. It's out of her league. Period. JIMMY, COME BACK SOON Madam. Be serious, come on. - Paola. - Damn… This is Father Erasmo Noguera. We know each other since school. - Right, Father? - That's right. Paola. May the Lord keep bringing peace to your heart. Thanks. Ángel told me what's going on between you. - What? - Yes. Everything. - And I love it! It's nice. - No. - I celebrate love. Let love penetrate! - What? Let it fly high from these unexpected places. Let it fly high like the eagles. That's why, Ángel, Paola, my answer… is yes. - Yes, of course! - "Yes" to what? Father has decided to marry us once you get out of here. - What? No! - Yes. - Father. - Paola. No. It'll be our secret. We guards cannot get involved with inmates. I'll wait for the right moment to tell my mommy. Father… What? Father! What? First, he brings his mother. Then, a priest. Girl, you swept him off his feet. Not only does he make up a love story, he writes it, directs it, acts in it, adds the FX, and believes it blindly. - He's lovely. - He's not lovely, he's intense. So? When's the wedding? I made up a weird story. I told them we couldn't have a Catholic wedding because I practiced a different religion, Zoroastrianism. What's that? - Did he buy it? - The priest did. Ángel says he doesn't care. He loves me and he'll marry me under any religion I want. Valery, can you believe it? Paola, you're such a hoot. Come on, go back to sleep! I'd rather see you laugh than hear you cry, okay? I'd make you laugh more if you weren't so reclusive. You keep me at a distance because you don't like me… You're a chatterbox and a pain… Okay. What do you want to know? Go ahead. - My life? - Everything. Both my career as a model and my boyfriend vanished as soon as I got pregnant. My boyfriend took off. He never wanted to man up, and I didn't go after him. What was he going to do for me? Nothing. When I tried to go back to my modeling career, and to get my mom to help me raise my kid… I couldn't. I was too fat. Nobody wanted to hire me again. And I had been one of the best. A friend of mine noticed I was really down and told me "Darling, go to that town. They're organizing a beauty pageant, I'm sure you'll win it." So I did. And I met Agustín Ortiz there. That man fell in love with me, became obsessed with me. He came after me, gave me loads of gifts, jewelry, makeup, dresses. He cared for my son and my family. He gave me everything. And I fell for him. How could I not? He asked me to go on a trip to Europe with him. And I said yes. But his people sent me there with a suitcase with a false bottom. I never saw it coming. And dogs are man's best friend as long as they're not from Anti-narcotics… He put drugs into your luggage? Unbelievable. That's in the past. It doesn't matter now. What matters is I'll get my life back, because he showed up recently and asked me for another chance. And I'll give it to him. I'll give it to myself. I deserve it. But that man is being sought everywhere by the Police. Right, and he will still be sought. That won't change. You know what? You were one of the nicest people I met here. What do you mean, "were"? Why the past tense? Because I'm leaving this place. He's getting me out. - You could come with me. - What? Me? He'll take care of us both. Think about it. If you carry out an operation to prevent the escape, Valery will still be locked up in here, and Agustín Ortiz will still be on the run. Our best option is to accept her offer. I'll get to this man's hideout and then contact you. I don't know. You'd be in great danger. It's your best shot to catch him. News spread like wildfire in here. I know about the pressure you're under… and the allegations about your work. Let me help you just like you helped me, Liliana. Right, so you break out, you arrive at Agustín Ortiz's hideout, and what if he blows your cover? That Sizu woman was this close to me, and she didn't recognize me. Let me do this, Liliana. I accepted to be part of this since day one. Look. This is the first time in my life I've felt I'm doing something really worthwhile. Okay. "Okay"? I'll run away with you. All right. So, Friday at the PA office. Isn't that office always locked? I'll get the keys. Don't worry about that. Trust me. Okay. This topographic map with contour lines marks exactly the polygonal points and the precise triangulations, boss. Perfect. What matters most is that the terrain stability will allow us to work soundlessly, which is what we need to finish the tunnel. - Are we building an inverted arch floor? - Not yet. But we have concrete slabs, rock rings, and mortar. We're good, boss. Here's the prison. The mole moves this way. PRISON HIDEOUT Very good, Sizu. Are you on a visit? - You're such a pain. - Go to bed! Now! Paola Linares and Valery Reinoso! Pao! Come on. Escape alert! Come on. Don't move. - Are you nervous? - Very. - How did you get the keys? - Knock it off. I'll tell you later. Come on. Ready to run? Something's wrong. - You barely made it. - Do you think it was easy? Come on. - Who's she? - A friend, she's coming with me. No, the boss didn't say anything about that. I don't care what the boss told you! She's coming with me. Come on! Move. Paola. I know you're escaping. Valery told me everything. I came to say goodbye. You knew about it? What matters most is that you love me. And I'll be waiting for you so we can get married. - Valery told you that, too? - Yes. But I want to hear it from your lips. Ángel. My guardian angel. When I'm free, I'll be waiting for you so we can get married, okay? And we'll be happy together. Just like we want to be. - Yes. - Okay, sweet pea? Okay, bye. What? No. Enough! Go after your freedom. I know life has beautiful things in store for us. What's wrong, girl? Come on, we're leaving. Move. Don't forget I love you! I'll be waiting for your call. Come on. Follow me. Move, girl, we're getting there. Come on, you go first. Come out with your hands up! Don't make us shoot. Don't try anything funny. We don't need any casualties. Get out! Right now! Check the car. Come on. Move. Right. - My naughty girl. - Honey! I thought you'd forgotten about me and would leave me there. Never. Plus, getting you out cost me an arm and a leg. I can imagine, honey. Very good, Sizu. Congratulations, everything ran smoothly. Not everything, sir. We brought more people than expected. Okay, but she's my friend. - She's legit, honey, I swear. - Thank you so much for getting me out too. I know you. No, sir, I don't think so. From where? Okay. If you're my girl's friend, there's only one thing left to do: welcome you. Thank you so much. Welcome. Thank you very much, Mr. Ortiz. Agustín. My female friends call me Agustín. Paola. Pao. Agustín, is there anything you need? I need you to prove your gratitude. I was sound asleep. You like toys, right? I have every kind of stuff here. We'll celebrate your freedom appropriately. What about Valery? Valery is a heavy sleeper. You want to wear this for me, right? Agustín, I'm terribly cold. I'll be your heater. What a day, huh? I have a terrible headache. Here's your acetaminophen. This is not right. Let's do it first, and then we'll see if it's right. No, we can't. Why? Because I'm not a woman, bro. I'm Jimmy Barón. So you do like dressing up as a woman. Very funny. Good performance. - Too bad it's going to be the last. - Hold on. I think you know each other. It's a pleasure for me to witness this reunion. Too bad it's going to be so brief. You don't like being on your own, Mr. Barón. You came home with Valery… and you'll leave this world with your assistant. - Let's talk, Mr. Ortiz. - About what? - Remember the undercover cop? - No. You shot her in that estate. - She's not dead. - What? There's no need to kill anyone today either. I missed that shot then, but I'll fix that right now. - No! - Freeze, you dumb-ass. Drop your gun! Drop it! Where's Paola Linares? And where's Valery Reinoso? How are you? I think you need this. It's good to see you. We're safe, Jimmy. Thank you, officer. You and I will talk later, okay? I didn't have time to contact you. How did you know we were here? Mr. Ángel is the one who deserves credit for this. So nice to meet you, Mr. Barón. My name's Ángel. We're looking for Paola Linares. Do you know where she is? She's my girlfriend. How did you locate this place, Ángel? This is an electronic tracking device. I have many devices like this because I'm always looking for my mommy. Ángel. You literally saved my life, brother. - My pleasure. - Thanks. Tell me. Where's Paola? Ángel. Paola doesn't exist. Ángel, I was Paola. Freeze! Well done, Sizu. Hand over your weapons, or I'll shoot the prosecutor. Sorry, what a shame. Shoot me first. No, Jimmy, what are you doing? This may be the first and last important thing I do in my life, Liliana. Shoot, Sizu! Drop your gun, Sizu! Valery, honey. "Honey," my ass. Valery, don't play the tough girl, you don't know how to shoot. Valery. How's that? - Valery… - Drop your gun! Valery, these people are after both of us. We're on the same side. No, you and I are not on the same side, girl. I am now turning myself in to the authorities. They won't have to look for me anymore. Drop your gun! Drop it! Agustín Ortiz made an attempt on a lieutenant's life. She was doing undercover work within his organization. He almost killed her, and we were really close to capturing him. Jimmy witnessed everything. From that day on, he was put in witness protection. Since we had to hide him, we decided to use his acting abilities and sent him to a place where he'd never be found: the women's prison. There, the plan to capture Agustín Ortiz was devised. I was taken to that estate by force. I don't even know how I got there. To be honest, these were tough days, but today I'm grateful for everything that came afterwards. I have to go. Sorry. - Okay. - Excuse me. Thanks. Jimmy. You were great at the press conference. Adrián. What is it? "What is it?" Jimmy, I know I screwed up, brother. I messed up really bad. Believe me, I was just… looking for a business opportunity for us. This was good money, you know? And I'd get a good commission, too. I think I deserve it. Then things went south and… But… I've learned my lesson. This has nothing to do with us. Don't you see, Jimmy? This was nothing but an accident. You can't convince me, Adrián. And get this: These last weeks have meant everything to me. They were… anything but an accident. Liliana Navarro gave me some life lessons I needed to learn. Liliana Navarro and a bunch of amazing women, okay? - That's perfect. - Yeah, right. You know what? Get yourself another job. If you need a reference, tell them to call me. I can tell them what kind of person you are. You should thank me for not reporting you, because you belong in jail. - Are you done? - Yes. I have nothing else to do here. - Hi, honey. - Hi, Lili. - How are you? - Fine. You look great to me. You look gorgeous. - Oh, sis… - Listen. You have a new roommate. Did you say hi? Not now… I'll say hi in a jiffy. No. Sorry, manners come first. Greet him now. Don't worry, I'll be leaving in a minute. I had to share a room with a Carolina Navarro, not with the most beautiful girl in the world. Jimmy! Caro, how are you? - How are you doing? - Fine! Nobody told me you were coming. Well, it was a surprise. I didn't come before because… I was busy being a jerk, but, anyway… I'm here now. How are you? How are you feeling? Fine, but I… didn't have a chance to get ready and look pretty. "Get ready and look pretty"? Well, I have some things here… that people have been using to make me look "pretty"… these last days. You might want to… try this, let's see. I don't know… You know what? I think you don't need this, Caro. You don't need it because… beauty is not in this kind of stuff, Carolina. Beauty is in our feelings, Carolina. And I know it because, the last few days, the more attention I paid to my looks… the more I tried to look good… the more I realized how monstrous… and ugly I was inside. You know, you don't need… wigs, high heels, bows, ties, to be beautiful. Beauty is simple, straightforward, humble. Serene. And happiness is about enjoying the moment. Because it's the only thing we have, okay? It's the only thing life gives us: this moment. Let's enjoy this moment, Carolina. Okay? José, check the connections. Let's try the keyboards. Let's try… Yes. Drumsticks take. Ready? Tell me. No, I'm coming to see them now. Okay. How are you doing? Well? Remember: At this signal, you stand up, at this one, you clap, at this one, you sit down. No cell phones. They mess with the show. All right? Welcome. Hey! You can handle your makeup all right. - Yes, I became quite good at it. - Really? I could do your makeup if you want. Okay. Fine. - I like applying lipstick. - Okay. But I like removing it even more. You're the best inhaler I've tried in my life. JIMMY, WE LOVE YOU Thank you so much for joining me today. I want to dedicate this show… to all the women at home and to all the women here, of course. Each one of you is… simply admirable. In fact, when the Bible talks about creation, it says God created man first. And it shows, it's clear. It shows man is a prototype God made to perfect His technique before achieving his most perfect creation: woman. Let's start by saying this, women: Your bellies make babies, ours make us ashamed. You women are the beginning and the end of everything. Because we are born from you… and we die for you. Long live women. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Not even walls Can stop Our desire To fly The future Depends on the present Only on that My inner strength doesn't go to the gym My character wasn't photoshopped My creativity reaches the space And I already put a stop to my ego I am fire In the dark I have Dreams of freedom I suffer in front of a glass of liquor Knowing I always lose at this game Since the kisses and caresses you gave me Are now memories of the past I suffer when I see That all the nice moments we lived Just slipped through our hands That I'm no longer your reason to be That you don't belong to me anymore And I wonder why Why does life have to be so cruel? Why does life have to be this way? Why do people abandon you When you're happiest and in love? Why does life have to be so cruel? Hello. Ángel? What are you doing here? - I didn't mean to scare you. - But you did. How did you get in? Tricks you learn in prison. By the way, I was there today. It was odd not seeing you there. Yes, it's my day off. I come from my mommy's. She sends her regards and… she approves our relationship. What? What relationship, Ángel? Didn't you get it? I'm a man. A man! Nobody's perfect. Plus, our feelings are what matter most. What feelings, Ángel? No. No, Ángel, cover that. Ángel, cover up. Ángel! This can't be real, Ángel. - It's time to consummate our love. - What love, Ángel? No. I'm calling the cops. - No, Ángel. - Call them! - Let them witness this mad love. - Back off. Don't run. You're just stalling.
