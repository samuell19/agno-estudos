A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM ["No Pienso Volver" by Pekeño 77 playing] ["No Pienso Volver" continues] [brakes screeching] [woman] I can't believe our luck. Neither can I. Almost time for our shift change. [video game sounds] Do you know where we are? Beats me. We're looking for the kidnapper of those girls. Don't you read the news? We're backup for Francisco Juánez. He's leading the "Luján Virgins" case. Okay. We're on watch in case that psycho turns up. That's such a relief. Exactly. If we're lucky, we'll catch the most wanted criminal of the year. If this is as big as you say, why are we alone? [car horn honking] [man] Everyone's in Luján. An army of cops. And we're here, with a district patrol in the middle of some field. "Come boldly unto the throne of grace." It's mentioned in several passages. It means the place of pilgrimage, a place where you can pray. The girls live in Luján, the guy is from Luján... The Basilica of Luján has thousands of pilgrims. What's in Zelaya? It's the first place they took the Virgin Mary when she was brought from Europe. It wasn't until later that she was taken to Luján. First, she was in Zelaya. Cuenca is obsessive and devout. If the Virgin started in Zelaya, his rituals are in Zelaya. He's a just fucking madman, a degenerate. The chief busts his balls doing psychological profiles, analyzing these madmen's minds. Don't be so simple, Ana. I don't need to understand anything. Put him in my sight for one second and he'll never bother anyone again. [gun cocks] Try not to miss, we're talking about two 10-year-old girls. What's in his mind? -Hatred. -Love... for God. He thinks he's the chosen one. But the girls he kidnaps make him doubt. [man] I hope we get there in time. [dramatic music playing] Where the hell are you, Juánez? They say Acuña is in charge here. I don't even know him. What's going on? Acuña knows what to do. I went to Zelaya. Zelaya? What the hell is Zelaya? Get your ass here, we can't fuck this up. It's already fucked up. Two girls are missing. And if I don't find them soon, we'll have two corpses. And how do I justify this to the judge? Just say I'm following my intuition. [dogs barking in distance] [indistinct conversation] [cell phone ringing] Let's go. [door creaks] [suspenseful music] DO NOT FEAR, FOR I AM WITH YOU DO NOT BE AFRAID, FOR I AM YOUR GOD WHOEVER HATES HIS BROTHER IS IN THE DARKNESS AND WALKS IN THE DARKNESS HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS GOING, BECAUSE THE DARKNESS HAS BLINDED HIS EYES COME BOLDLY UNTO THE THRONE OF GRACE I just spoke with Acuña, he's not at the Basilica. He knows we found the Bible and his stuff at his place. He knew we were coming. Yes, but he's on a mission, and he won't stop until he fulfills it. [dogs barking] The girls aren't here. Permission to speak, sir. Yes. What? The dogs. What about the dogs? They won't stop barking. The barking comes from the southeast. They sound less than a kilometer away. Behind those trees. [dogs continue barking] [dogs barking loudly] [two gunshots] Ordóñez, do you copy? Ana, do you copy? [dogs barking] [Juánez] What happened? It was eating her. [barking] Get him out of here. [dog whines] They're tame. It wasn't the dogs, they're well fed. Juánez, Ana, do you copy? [on walkie-talkie] Juánez, Ana, do you copy? I'll go find them. Stay here. [dog barks] [metallic snap] [woman screaming] [sobbing loudly] Hang in there. It's okay. [whimpering] [grunting] [gun cocking] [sobbing] [gun shot] [sniffing] [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -[Ordóñez] Where are you, Chief? We have a 911. A girl was murdered in San Isidro. -Give me the address, I'll see you there. -I'm alone. -Ana was taken to the hospital. -Take the new girl. Pelari! You're coming with us as Mariani's replacement. Get in, please. [gasping] LUJÁN VIRGINS KIDNAPPER KILLS HIMSELF [reporter] We're with the DA, Emilio Roger. What can you tell us? It was a race against the clock, but we were always one step ahead. We set up operations in Luján and here, in Zelaya. We couldn't fail, and we didn't. ONE OF THE KIDNAPPED GIRLS WAS FOUND ALIVE [reporter] Can you confirm the killer is dead? Yes, he apparently killed himself. [reporter] Was Francisco Juánez in charge? [Roger] This DA's office was in charge of the investigation and had help from a professional of the stature of Inspector Juánez. [reporter] Please, tell us what you know about... [cell phone ringing] [Ordóñez] Juánez, where are you? The victim is a VIP. [doctor] Here's your prescription. I'll have to give you a booster shot in 48 hours. [sighs] You'll get me in trouble, Juánez. I thought you were worried about me. You know you can't keep this up. -What if you die during a case? -It's my life. We're not only talking about you, you're putting everyone at risk. I get it. [man] Female in her early twenties. According to witnesses, her name was Gloriana Márquez. She was assaulted with a sharp weapon. She has a neck wound. I'd say the cause of death was a hypovolemic shock. -Where is Juánez? -He's on his way. I'll continue. She has no self-defense injuries. Maybe they killed her while she was asleep. She wasn't sexually assaulted either. Were you worried about me, Aguada? Don't get me started, Juánez. My vacation started today, and here I am, busy like a bee. She's worse off then you. -The murder weapon? -We didn't find it, Chief. When was she murdered? The body is rigid and cold. I'd say she was murdered 18 to 24 hours ago. -It doesn't seem like burglary. -I'll go wait for her transport outside. All yours, Juánez. LOCKED [Roger] Juánez, come downstairs. The boss is here. Let's go. -Your name? -Manuela Pelari, they call me Pipa. These are the ones who found her, her boyfriend and her best friend, her roommate. Actually, the boy found her. Juánez, come here. The girl is Gloriana Márquez. She's the daughter of Márquez, the grocery store magnate. -They're all someone's daughter. -You know what I mean. The guy is tight with the media, he has connections. And I know your methods. I can handle the Cuenca buzz. No one cares about the death of a psychopath like him. On the contrary, they celebrate it. But here, we're exposed. -I don't want a fuss. -Understood. [cell phones ringing] -Robles. -[Roger] Hi. Yes. Yes, yes. Who's Patricio Galván? Fucking shit. Yes, yes. I understand. Take care of it. Keep me posted. [Roger] Last night Patricio Galván was killed. He was murdered riding his bike home. I don't understand what this has to do with Juánez. Juliana Herrera. Juánez's wife. The kid accidentally shot her. He was being robbed,and she was there. Wrong place at the wrong time. Yes, but it was classified as involuntary manslaughter. [Roger] Yes. Galván was released from preventive custody a month ago. But he had no criminal record, he had a shop, he was always straight. So the judge released him pending oral trial. Now he's dead. And they think it was Juánez. When Galván was arrested, Juánez went crazy. He almost punched him to death. No report was filed. His men at the Sixth Precinct covered up for him, the same men... who are now in charge of investigating the kid's death. They call it loyalty, but it's corruption. And now it's possible we're dealing with a homicide case inside the force. Look, Pelari... Juánez is a brilliant investigator. He's done a lot for the force throughout the years. But since his wife was murdered, he's not himself. The way he solves cases jeopardizes the final result of justice. If it weren't for him, the girl would be dead. And if it weren't for him, Officer Mariani wouldn't be in the hospital wondering if she'll ever walk again. If you suspect Juánez, why don't you open an investigation? Why do you need me? He requested you for the Márquez case, we'll use that. I need you to investigate if Juánez had something to do with Patricio Galván's death. If it's what I'm thinking, and enough evidence is found, they can't deny me the investigation. Rodolfo will be your liaison. If you need anything, ask him. You're asking me to spy on Francisco Juánez. How are you, Rodrigo? I want to leave. I told you everything I know. [Juánez] You're the one who found her, right? How long had you been dating? Around two years. -What happened to your face? -Nothing, I bumped into something. Does Márquez scare you? He thinks it was you. At this point, the entire nation must think it was you. VICTIM'S FATHER POINTS AT BOYFRIEND I don't even know how we're going to get him out today, Chief. Did you kill her? -No, you can't use your phone here. -My dad just arrived. Rodrigo... If she hit you, I'll know. Do you understand? It looks like... It looks like it was caused by a ring. Yes. Like this. But I won't know when she did it. So I have to believe she was forced to defend herself. Will you lead us to believe you're the last one to be in a fight with her? Gloriana fought with everyone, I wasn't the only one. Well... they say she had a temper. She was drunk, she wanted me to go with her. [hip-hop playing] [Rodrigo] We always did whatever she wanted. We all did whatever she wanted. [inaudible] [Juánez] She punched you just because you wouldn't go with her? A bit of an overreaction, don't you think? What can I tell you? Women are unpredictable. [both chuckle] Where were you after that? He said he was home alone, sleeping. -Being alone is a terrible alibi. -I didn't know I would need one. I'm tired of this crap. I want to go, it wasn't me. It wasn't? Fuck you. You want to press charges, talk to my lawyer. What are you doing? -No... you can't check my phone. -Do you know what this is? -Gloriana's cell phone. -[Juánez] Very good. Read this out loud. "Rodri, forgive me. Come home, we'll make up. Darling, I'm waiting for you." I didn't see these messages. You're lying to me, brat. Do you think if you delete messages we won't know you went to see her? [Ordóñez] She's his housekeeper. You have 10 minutes to think what you're going to tell me. You know how women are, right? Unpredictable. WE WANT JUSTICE FOR PATRICIO GALVÁN [camera clicks] [motorcycle approaching] [engine revving] Didn't the prosecutor see where Galván was run over? It's no man's land. The closest camera is a kilometer away. -It doesn't seem like an accident. -Give him what you've got. -Tell your boss we're working on it. -[exhales] Thanks. Don't thank me, we're on the same team, aren't we? Excuse me. Ms. Arévalo. Jennifer. Do you know why you're here? Yes, last night he was home, asleep. I was asked to give my statement. Yes. Tell me, what's your relationship to Rodrigo? Normal. He's a polite guy, I like him. He likes me too. Was Gloriana at his place that day? Yes, for a bit, but they got into a fight and she left. What happened? I made ceviche, his favorite dish, and she got angry. She said ceviche made her puke and that we did it on purpose. That you did it on purpose? Who? You and Rodrigo? She said, "Fucking trash, cook me something decent," and she threw the plate in the garbage. Ooh. So you got angry. No, he got angry. And you saw him again early next morning? Yes, he came home around 4:00. His face was bruised, he asked me for some ice. -Did he go out again? -No. -How do you know? -Well, I was... I was awake, I... I would've seen him leave. [suspenseful music] [beeping] Deceased female identified by the name of Gloriana Márquez. Height, 1.65 meters. Total weight, 62 kilograms. Proper basic hygiene. Apparently adequate nutrition, full set of teeth, healthy. Ulcerous lesions on the neck and stabs in the same area. No genetic material under nails. [Juánez] Hmm... -She didn't defend herself. -No. Nor does she show signs of having been tied up. Intact wrists and ankles. Next. Pulmonary edema, damage to alveolar septa, pulmonary hemorrhage, asphyxia. Don't write down that nonsense, and if you do, don't believe it. Are you going to keep busting my balls, Juánez? [cup bangs] Asphyxia wasn't the cause of death. The neck stabbings killed her. [chuckles] What about the lung lesions? Don't make me laugh. A process of mechanical suffocation, which may have made her lose consciousness and hurt her lungs. With a bladed weapon. She was stabbed on the throat. It was quick, a 30 to 40 second sequence. Confirm the state of the subclavian vein. -It's perforated. -[Juánez] As I imagined. There was blood in the room, but no splatter. Most of the blood settled inside the pleural cavity. Now... given the direction and lesions, the killer is right-handed. Yes. The body was found lying on a shoulder, sideways. But the stains are on her back. Yes. When we die, circulation stops. And what happens to the blood? Gravity makes it fall to the lower parts. In time, that blood looks like violet spots. All right. What does that tell us? [inhales] It helps us know the corpse's position at death. If we analyze these spots, we can know if the original position was changed. Juánez, don't turn the autopsy room in forensics school. Please, man. What do you see in this corpse? The spots are on her back. They don't match the position she was found in, do they? Take a good look. Think. Think. According to the spots, she was killed on the bed and left face up. It's clear, for some reason, the killer turned her body some time after. -At least two or three hours later. -Very good. -Now, let's talk about the marking. -What marking? The one on her back, over her shoulder blade, Miss Know-It-All. Yes, I see it. The body laid on an object that left a mark before she was moved. The key in this story isn't the marking. It's the timing. The murderer attacked Gloriana while she was asleep. He covered her mouth and nose with one hand, and stabbed her neck with a sharp instrument. A hard object left the mark over the shoulder blade. An object that wasn't found at the crime scene. Yes. And for the blood to clot and leave the marking, the body must've been in that position at least three hours. What does that tell us? That whoever has the object that left the mark could be the killer. EXIT [Pipa] Patricio Galván's death can be placed between 19:00 and 23:00 hours. The impact was produced by a car. Juánez was in Zelaya until 21:00 hours. Where was he between 21:00 and 23:00? Why did he then arrive late to Gloriana Márquez's house? [cell phone ringing] [Rodolfo] The file and footage the Sixth Precinct gave me are useless. I need to find the car that ran over Galván. Ask transit or toll departments directly. Oh, and I found something I want you to send to the lab. [sobbing] You should've protected him. You brother is asking for revenge. Shh! Can you hear him? I can hear him crying. Can you hear him? Yes, Mom. Make him stop. This is not just any cop. I need to be sure. But rest assured, if it's him, I'll take care of it. That cop did it. I know. If you don't avenge your brother... the Devil will take his soul. He killed him like a dog. He has to die like a dog too. [sobs] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicking] What was your relationship to Gloriana? She was my best friend. When did you last see her alive? That morning. -Before I went to my grandma's. -Uh-huh. Not that night, but the next day? [murmurs] -In words, please. -Yes. -She was asleep. -But did you see her or not? Yes, I saw her. -But she was asleep. -Why did you say you hadn't? -I wasn't thinking. She was asleep. -Okay. Relax and think. Why did you go to her room? Did you always watch her while she slept? No, I don't know why I did. I don't know. Whose idea was it to go look for her? Mine, I think. Why did you ask Rodrigo to go with you? -I told you already. -I'd rather you repeat it. She wouldn't pick up the phone. Yes, but why did you ask Rodrigo to go with you? It was your house, your friend, they had just fought. Why didn't you go alone? [hip-hop playing] [inaudible] [Roger] Your friend wasn't exactly a people person. It must be hard to live with someone like that, right? [hip-hop continues] You know lying during an investigation is a crime. On the other hand, you were always so kind, so patient. Why? Why did you stay with her? Why were you always with her? -Because no one else was. -Did you defend her? Yes. You never felt the need to defend yourself from her? I was with my grandma until I went to school. All that time, you were at your grandma's. Yes, I told you already. Ah. The front door wasn't forced open. You left the nightclub after she insulted you in front of everyone. No one ever saw her again, and she was found dead. Minerva... if you help me now and tell me what happened, I may be able to help you. It was my fault. I left her alone. If I'd stayed, we'd still be together. Let's make sure you understand, Minerva. Your grandma's alibi won't help you. Gloriana's death happened before that, and it places you... and only you, at the scene of the crime. I know you're lying to me. Personal crimes are most often between people who care for each other, and often caused by feelings of love that turn into hate, just like that. And I get it. I don't justify it, of course. But I understand. I know you didn't want any of this to happen. I know. Isn't that right? But you couldn't take it anymore, you had to defend yourself. You had to defend yourself from her attacks. Am I right or not? Tell me what happened. You'll feel better, you'll see. Yes. Yes what? I killed her. [Rodolfo whistling softly] You won't find anything among my stuff to rule out Juánez. Fucking shit. [Rodolfo] What? Juánez's car is two kilometers from the place Galván's body was found. So he's at the crime scene? It's not the crime scene. The camera marks 21:27. 21:27? The time matches from Zelaya to Márquez's house. And the time matches Galván's death. I'll send this to Roger right away. If we're going to work together, you'll have to do what I say. And that includes Roger. That footage doesn't mean anything. -But... -But nothing. We have to retrace Juánez's actions. -Do you also think Juánez is guilty? -Don't you? What did you find out about the Galváns? [sighs] [clears throat] The Galván family. They belong to a gypsy community. They have a shop that sells auto parts and car accessories. That shop is where Patricio Galván killed Juánez's wife. [Pipa] And Zorro? Zorro is the eldest of the Galván brothers. He's big in the neighborhood. His rap sheet includes stolen car parts, but the charges were dropped. He never reached trial. I don't understand what this has to do with what we're investigating. What if Patricio's death has nothing to do with Juánez and a lot to do with Zorro's deals? Juánez had it in for him. He reacted as any other victim's family, that doesn't make him a murderer. We're investigating Galván's case here, not the Juánez case. You told me you'd send it yesterday. Okay. Great, send it to me. Inspector. Did you ask the magistrate judge for the warrant? Yes, I just filed the request. Sit. Aguada's preliminary autopsy was wrong. It doesn't match the time frame. Here's the new report. Don't fuck with me, Juánez. I don't give a damn about the autopsy, the girl confessed. Don't you fuck with me, Roger. That confession is bogus. Is Márquez rushing you? Márquez isn't rushing me. No one is. The girl's confession is enough to get preventive custody. Do you know what happened? How did she kill her? The knife, where is it? She can't talk anymore, she's with her lawyer. She self-incriminates and goes from witness to suspect. You know I can't interrogate her anymore without her lawyer present. She'll be charged formally in 24 hours. Bring the missing evidence. Do your job, I'll do mine. You're rushing into things. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT [Juánez] Yes. -I heard. -What a twist of fate. Not a month out of jail, and now he's dead. -What do you want? -The truth. -The truth? -Mm-hmm. [chuckles] If you have something to say, say it. It's an ongoing investigation. I'm running it. Hmm. This isn't... another one of your interrogations with scared teenagers. I have nothing to do with Galván's death. I'm offering you a chance. ["Peluche Peligroso" by Acus playing] [sex worker 1] Hi, honey... [sex worker 2] What a cutie! I'll do anything. Hi, baby. -I'm not a lesbian, keep looking. -No, I'm not looking for that. I don't sell, but if you take me, I'll get you the good stuff. Get in. I didn't do anything, I don't sell. I was doing you a favor. I want information about Patricio Galván. He was your cellmate, right? Were you friends? Yes, but Pato is dead. Tell me something new. He was a good kid. He wasn't a murderer. He regretted it, and was afraid. Why? Well, he killed a cop's wife, why else? He had a hard time. He wasn't prison material. His mother paid for his protection. I took care of him, I followed his every step. -And he gets killed the minute he's out? -What do you mean? I'm here to find out who killed Patricio. If you know anything that could help me, anything at all, I need you to tell me. I know Pato got out early. Because he didn't have a record. That's why his lawyer was able to get a release. He made a deal, that's why they released him. What deal? I don't know. But Pato gave major information and his brother got really mad. That's why the kid was alone, his brother left him to his own devices. Since Pato got out, they stopped talking. He wanted to make peace with his family. He thought his brother would look after him and take him back. I told him, "Skip town, get lost." But he didn't listen. And there you have it, he was murdered. Big tough gypsy, but he let his brother get killed. It was his fault. -The guys say hi. -How's it going as chief? I'm not you, but... Thanks for the recommendation. -What's up? -You were right. Roger has someone on Galván's case, a lawyer. He came looking for info. No one saw anything, there's no evidence. They have nothing. The file cover says "hit and run," that's the way we're going. Don't worry, you're bulletproof. We've all got your back. -That son of a bitch deserved it. -Keep the guys at bay. Them saying justice was served doesn't help me. Justice is for the living, and Juliana is dead. -Thanks. -Okay. [Pipa] Zorro has a criminal record. And Patricio Galván made a deal with the prosecutor for early release, then he was killed within a month. -Who? -Patricio's older brother. The brothers were estranged. Maybe he squealed information about one of Zorro's deals, or maybe a name. That's not legal, and if it happened, it's not on record. What if they didn't want the kid to squeal? What if he was killed to send his brother a message? We don't know who was harmed by the information Patricio gave. No, what we don't know is if he even said anything. -Where did you get all this? -From someone close to Patricio. So anyone in Zorro's circle is a suspect, or at least as much as Juánez is. Even the brother. We have to look into the Galváns, we need to know what Patricio squealed. Look, Pelari, I put you here to investigate if Juánez has anything to do with the kid's death or not. The Galváns aren't suspects, and in any case, that's not your job. If Zorro is involved, he may be trying to divert the investigation and frame Juánez. All right. I'll talk with the DA's office, see what I can find out, but don't veer from your assignment. Don't forget why I put you here. Madam, your granddaughter confessed. There's nothing I can do, I'm sorry. -Please, Inspector, uh... -Juánez. Francisco Juánez. Inspector Juánez, my granddaughter was tricked. They made her say whatever came to mind. She's young, she's traumatized, she lost her best friend. I know it's hard for you, but with such a confession, the prosecutor... You saved that girl from the Luján case that's in the papers, right? Mm-hmm. Gloriana was impossible, I admit. She was resented, she envied us. Always getting my granddaughter into trouble. Not even dead will she leave us alone. Was she with you all morning? Yes, how about that? She cuts a throat and comes over for breakfast as if nothing happened. What kind of person would do that? A very sick person. -I don't get it, what do you mean? -Nothing. It's a plausible explanation. My granddaughter loved Gloriana very much, she was very attached to her, okay? Her dad was never in her life, my daughter died years ago. Minerva is fragile, she doesn't know how to react when she's cornered. Your idea of fragility is quite peculiar, madam. I guess you've done this for many years, am I right? -You've never seen someone like that? -Like her? What do you mean? Someone more fragile than the rest. It's always easier to point at the most vulnerable person. That person is always the most obvious culprit. That's how it works. Not with the truth, but with whatever is most obvious. Someone seems guilty, then she's guilty. Just like that. She killed Gloriana, and she did it while she was asleep. First she asphyxiated her, and then she stabbed her to death. I'm sure Gloriana got what she deserved. That girl was a demon, bad, dark. And I don't care if she's dead, but my granddaughter isn't a murderer. I recommend you not to speak about Gloriana that way. It doesn't help your granddaughter. Everyone's worried about the supermarket magnate, right? You need to find a culprit fast, and my granddaughter is the perfect scapegoat. Please, Inspector, help me. Talk to her, give her another chance. That's all I'm asking, give her another chance. This interrogation won't be valid without her lawyers. -The charges have been pressed. -The lawyers won't let her speak. I have to hear her out. The confession she gave to Roger isn't enough for me. Now... let's go in, there isn't much time. -[Pipa] It's too risky. -Listen to me. You're going in. Me? No. No, I can't. -I've never interrogated anyone. -She won't want to speak to me. You'll have a better chance. You're a woman, you're almost the same age. Here. What is this? Ask her to tell you how she killed her, where the weapon is. But don't give her any information about the scene. Don't let her know what we've got. Manuela, I trust you. You can do it. Wipe that frown off your face. I'll be watching. Five minutes. Hi, Minerva. I'm a bit nervous. It's my first time. My name is Manuela Pelari. They call me Pipa. I can't talk with anyone without my lawyer. Don't talk if you don't want to. But I have to ask. I've told them everything. What else do you want? Why did you confess? Just because. -I don't care anymore. -What don't you care about? About what happens to me. Living without her. I have nothing left. I don't want to get out. I want to be alone. I know how it feels to lose your best friend. I lost mine when I was 14. Her name was Cornelia. She went missing, it feels like it was yesterday. I also feel it was my fault. FRIENDS FOREVER Even if everyone says it wasn't. -I should be dead. -But you're alive. Your friends say you're innocent. I don't have any friends. -Gloriana is my only friend. -Your grandma says so too. My grandma wants me to go back home to her. I'd rather be here, locked up, than go back to that house, [murmuring] Dead. Show me where you killed her. And then, what did you do? -What do you mean? I don't understand. -Yes, you understand. What did you do to Gloriana? -Nothing, I left. -You're lying to me, Minerva. -I need you to tell me the truth. -I already told you the truth. I killed her. I killed her and covered her with a blanket because I couldn't look at her face. I told her I was sorry and I left. [knock on door] And what did you do with the weapon? Where did you leave it? I don't know... I left it there. [door buzzing] [camera beeping] [woman] Good morning. Can I help you? [Pipa] Yes, thank you. How much is it? Ma'am, are you all right? Is that your son? Yes, my youngest. He wanted to study to be an aircraft pilot. He'd say, "When I learn how to fly, I'll get out of here. I'll travel the world. And I'll take you with me." Just imagine. I've never stepped out of this town, and he wanted to put me in an airplane. He seems smart. They killed him, you know? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That'll be 120 pesos. There are no messages on the boy's cell phone. He claims... he never got them. But Gloriana sent them from hers. They're not in Rodrigo's WhatsApp, he deleted them. Or someone did. -What did the housekeeper say? -What everyone says. That Gloriana was a bitch. [sighs] The kid's alibi is his housekeeper. They're telling the truth, but they're lying. They were together. That's why Gloriana punched him at the nightclub. She caught them. That's why the text messages are gone. Jenny must've deleted them so Rodrigo wouldn't go to Gloriana's house. Would they rather be murder suspects than confess they had a secret affair? Maybe. But Minerva's confession doesn't add up. It may serve Roger's purpose of entertaining the press and bringing some peace to her family, but it has contradictions. Yes, but why would she confess to a murder if she's innocent? I don't know yet, but her confession isn't enough. Now she'll have to prove it was her, or rather we'll have to prove it was her. You read the autopsy report? Yes, the time frame places her at the scene, -but also away from that house. -There's more. She's left-handed, and the autopsy says the killer was right-handed. Besides, Minerva's description of the body's position doesn't match the position we found it in. The murder weapon is missing. We have to go back to the crime scene. What's wrong? I have to ask. Where were you after Zelaya? -I had things to do. -Oh, really? You vanish three hours, arrive late to the scene, and Patricio Galván turns up dead. [sighs] You too? [scoffs] Listen... what do you want me to say? Was it you? -Did you kill him? -No. What do you think? That I'd tell you if I did it? Why? Because we've worked together how long? Six years? -Seven. -Seven. See how hard it is, man? Seven years, and you still can't tell if I'm telling the truth or lying. Come on. Okay, I had to ask. I'll wait for you in the car. No. I'm going with Manuela. [pill bottle rattling] [sighs] [lock clicking] So? Did you find anything? There's a diary, but it's old. It says nothing about the last days. She's very tidy, if she left at seven, I'm sure she made her bed, tidied up and left. I found this little box from a French jewelers. It's empty. It doesn't seem like something a girl like Minerva could've bought. More likely a heirloom or a gift. Come, take a look at this. Is the door locked? -Yes. -Open it. LOCKED - UNLOCKED It's broken. It was unlocked all along. It didn't occur to anyone in forensics to try it. They assumed the lock worked. They saw it locked, took the prints, and ruled there wasn't a forced entry. But no one opened the door. Nor did they make sure the lock worked properly. [Pipa] Someone must've entered this way. Let's see what's on the other side. What do you see? A terrace. I'm climbing up. There's a blood print. [lock clicking] [camera clicking] I found the weapon. What do we do now? The blood on the dividing wall is enough to get a search warrant. Roger. Put Roger through. I don't care if he's in a meeting, pull him out, it's urgent. [police sirens wailing] [woman] Tell me what you're looking for, maybe I can help you. Do you have to make such a mess? Mauro is very attached to his things, to his routines. [Pipa] Come with me, please. Why is he committed? [woman] It happens sometimes. They need to change his medication when something out of the ordinary or unusual happens. -If something scares him, he panics. -Something like what? If someone touches him. Or the pigeons. Loud music. [Ordóñez] Chief. We found something. -Ma'am, please come with us. -[woman] Yes. So? Is this your son's backpack, ma'am? -Yes. -For the record, the mother identifies it as belonging to the suspect. -Suspect of what? -Homicide, ma'am. What are you saying? Mauro, Mauro... he could never. Send everything to the lab to check for genetic material, and compare it to the victim's. Okay? And I want Mauro Solari's fingerprints right away. You're wrong. You have no idea what you're saying. Ma'am, see what's in the backpack? What do you think? All this, is it your son's? No. Did you know your son would climb down there? He crept down to the sliding door and in the girl's house next door. -You didn't know. -No. Well, it doesn't matter. He did it, and quite often. [Ordóñez] They found the weapon. [suspenseful music playing] [button clicks] If this happened to me, with someone in my family, I'd also want revenge. He's scared, he doesn't know what he did. Juánez's job is catching murderers, Patricio isn't a monster. Patricio is a murderer. Maybe Juánez is the monster, and you don't want to see it. [phone chimes] Maybe after all those years working to catch them, he became one. What is it? The lab results from the piece of Galván's bicycle. The red mark on the bike's fender is car paint. The car that ran over Galván is red, it doesn't match Juánez's car. July 18th. It's the same day as Juánez's prescription. Santa Ana Hospital. Doctor Aguirre? Find out where it is. [Rodolfo] Here it is. We spotted Juánez's car leaving Santa Ana Hospital. He went to the hospital. -I'll find out. -No, I'll go. [Juánez] I want to see him. -Impossible, he's heavily medicated. -I don't care. I'm investigating a homicide and the kid is very likely the killer. So, pull out his IV and get him clean as soon as possible. We tried lowering the dosage. Each time we did it, it was a disaster. He has fits that make him dangerous to himself and to others. Too late, doctor. He already was dangerous. He may have killed a 20-year-old girl. -I find that hard to believe. -Why? Didn't you just say he can be dangerous to himself and to others? He's a patient that isn't violent, in spite of his outbursts. He can hurt himself, yes. Or he can shove someone trying to stop him. But he's incapable of directing his own actions. His mind doesn't work that way. He disconnects from reality, but when he's stable, all he can do is repetitive mechanical actions. Same routines, meals, habits, walks. I want to know his mind. But not the way you're telling me. I want to see him... outbursts and all. So get him off the medication. EMERGENCY Good evening. They told me you're looking for me. I'm on call, it's been a hard day. How can I help you? Doctor, pleased to meet you. Manuela. -My pleasure. -It's important. I'm here to talk about Francisco Juánez. There's not much to say. Look... I know he's sick and you're his doctor. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I want to know what's wrong with him. And I'm not the only one. It's better if you tell me. Okay. Come, follow me. I owe Juánez everything. If it wasn't for him, my son would be dead. He was his first case. [sighs] He was eight. He was kidnapped three blocks from school. They spent four months looking for him. Everyone said that I'd never see him again, that he'd been taken abroad, or that he was dead. But not Juánez, he kept going. I'd go see him every day and he'd tell me he was closer. I'd go home believing it, that he was closer, and I waited. Until one day he said... -he had found him. -How long has he been your patient? He's not my patient. No, look. Juánez... has a heart condition, but he doesn't take care of it. About a year ago, he showed up here feeling really sick. He told me he'd get agitated easily, that he had cramps. I requested some tests, recommended a colleague, a specialist. But he told me his heart couldn't be fixed. And that all he wanted was for me to help him stay on the streets. But if he doesn't get help, he'll die. And you're a doctor. I'm a father. I owe him. Did he come by Thursday night? -Yes. -At what time? Around 10:00, my shift was just starting. He didn't look well, he was... really sick. I gave him an intravenous dopamine shot, gave him some pills, the prescription. So he was here with you. Are you aware if you don't report it, you're responsible for what could happen? Yes. And now you are too. Juánez was in Santa Ana Hospital after Zelaya. He didn't kill Galván. He's innocent. [sighs] [pop music playing] This isn't just any occasion, rookie. From now on, you're part of the team. [laughs] Had I known all it took was showing you my ability to drink, we should've started with that. Well... [both laugh] How about that? The Chief is a charismatic man. Have you noticed? Two cases in one day is more than charisma. Chief! Come. [Juánez] I see you started without me. No, we were waiting for you. You can show me how, Pipa. You're in now. Yes, yes, I know, I'm part of the team. They've made it clear to me. Well, a toast to that. Mm. -Welcome. -Thanks. -Did you work things out with Roger? -Yes. Minerva is being released. We have to wait to interrogate Solari, but the warrant is ready. We have the blood print on the wall and the weapon. That should be enough, right? Yes, but the object that left the marking on her back is still missing. I want to talk to him. They won't take him in until tomorrow, so today, let's toast. Someone's looking for me. [soft rock music playing] Is he always like that? Yes, sometimes even worse. [man] You coming? Okay. Pelari says Juánez is innocent. That he was in Santa Ana Hospital when Galván was hit. Is there any evidence? Yes, Pipa spoke with the doctor that tended to him that night. Yes, but Pelari doesn't know Juánez. It could be a false testimony. Go to the hospital. See if you can find some footage, any conclusive evidence. -All right. Should I first let Pipa know? -No. I'll handle Pelari. Perfect. [Pipa] Can I get a beer? [slow R&amp;B playing] Thanks. My treat, Pelari. Tomorrow's my day off. There's a nightclub a couple of blocks away. We could go. Have any plans tonight? Yes, she does. Sorry, Chief... I didn't know. There's no need to apologize. The officer still has work to do. Of course. Excuse me. I could've handled it. I'm sure. It wasn't for you, it was for him. so he wouldn't be embarrassed. What's your secret? If I told you, it would no longer be a secret. To be good at this, I need to know. Isn't that what our job is about? To be good at this, you'd have to find out. Don't you think? Don't you care what they think? Everyone's talking about Galván. I know it wasn't you. It's unfair they think you're guilty. Why don't you defend yourself? I want to help you. I don't need help. But thanks anyway. Drive me home? [cell phone vibrating] Hi, doctor. Did something happen? The police? When? What did they look like? Yes, I understand. Anything else? THE DARK SIDE TO MY PERSONAL HERO, I LOVE YOU, "DETECTIVE," JULIANA Did I wake you up? -Anything wrong? -No. I slept in. I've got to go. [sighs] I sent you the pictures from Solari's cell phone. Thanks, Costa, I'll look in a minute. MAURO SOLARI'S CELL PHONE PICTURES [cell phone ringing] Fito, find out if Juliana Herrera had a car registered under her name and any info you can for me. Model, address, tickets, anything. [camera clicking] [cell phone ringing] [woman] Francisco! -I'm lucky to find you. -[Juánez] What are you doing here? What's wrong? I came to talk to you. Chief... Yes, I saw the pictures from Solari's cell phone. He was obsessed with Minerva Del Valle. Okay, tighten Mauro Solari's custody. [Ordóñez] Yes, Chief, I'm just arriving at the loony bin now. I've got to go. I'm asking you not to come anymore. I've told you, I'm all right. It'll only be for a while. I know you, Francisco. You're like a son to me. What are you hiding? Nothing. You're all I've got left. -You know that, don't you? -I'll be fine, Carmen. So will you. But I don't want them connecting you to me. Please. Where is he? -He was right here. -I know he was here. -Where the hell were you? -I went for coffee. Your job is guarding a detainee, not the detainee's empty room, you moron! -Sit there, don't move! -Yes, sir. [cell phone ringing] Solari disappeared. Where are you? Minerva's getting stuff from her house and isn't answering. I'm in the area, I'll be there in 10 minutes. [siren blaring] [cell phone ringing] -Hello. -[grandmother] Minerva? The killer escaped. And the police think he may be looking for you. [door creaking] [feet stomping] [siren approaching] [Pipa] Police! [loud buzzing] [Mauro groaning, yelling] [panting] Minerva! [Pipa] No. No, no! [gasps] [sirens wailing] [clears throat] -Excuse me. -Inés. -Minerva is finishing her deposition. -Right. I want to thank you in person for everything you've done. [phone chimes] SENDING MAIL WITH VIDEO OF JUÁNEZ ENTERING HOSPITAL 22:04 HRS POSSIBLE ALIBI CONFIRMED HE'S INNOCENT -Mm-hmm. You're welcome. -I brought you a gift. No, I appreciate it, but I just did my job. You never gave up, and now my granddaughter is free. Pipa... The ambulance guys left you the preliminary report. Did you meet before or did you meet outside your house? [tense music playing] [inaudible conversation] GALVÁN CASE, SANTA ANA HOSPITAL SECURITY FOOTAGE Do you believe in guardian angels? My daughter and I each had one. It's our protector, our most precious treasure. They're unique pieces passed on from one generation to the next among the women in my family. Minerva inherited my daughter's, it's all she has of her. Mine is for you. I won't let you refuse to accept it. -That's very kind. -Well, I'll go see my granddaughter. Again, thanks for everything. [Juánez] Call them back. [Pipa] Excuse me, please. [grunting] Hand it over, asshole. -What are you talking about? -No? [groans] [grunting] [man] You don't know what I'm talking about? I'm sorry, but with all this work, we have to eat whenever we get the chance. -Want some? -No, Inspector, thanks. I do. Thanks. [Juánez] I'm glad to see you didn't lose your appetite, Minerva. Eating isn't easy after committing murder. Although some people gain weight after committing murder. A few years ago, I met a man that gained over 20 kilos in the few months after committing murder. You know, jail food... What an unpleasant story. Yes, but it doesn't end there. I asked him why he'd gained weight, you know what he said? He was doing time for stabbing his wife 12 times, and he said, "My wife was a terrible cook. That's why I killed her. It wasn't jealousy. I killed her because, for 10 years, I had to eat what she cooked. I did it in self defense." [Inés] If you don't mind, Inspector, Minerva needs to rest. How did you find out? The killer always takes something and leaves something behind. -That's why the scene is so important. -[Juánez] Yes. He took her wedding ring. He kept it, that's how we caught him. Just like Mauro. Yes. Exactly. But there's an object we couldn't find among the things he took. An object that left a mark on Gloriana's back. But it was your grandma, you, Inés, who unwittingly brought me the key. -Me? -Yes. When you gave me this gift. Why did you give the owl to a stranger? He spared you from spending your entire life in jail. I don't understand what you're getting at, Inspector. Mauro Solari took my granddaughter's owl? No, no. He came in later. He sneaked inside as he always did, when the girls weren't there, to spy on Minerva. He altered the scene. He moved the body and took the knife, but the owl wasn't there. [Pipa] When Mauro got there, Gloriana was already dead. -Get up, Minerva, we're leaving. -No. I took the owl. It was my mother's. At first, we ruled out Minerva as a suspect, in spite of her confession. Her statements didn't match. Her description of the body's position was wrong. She insisted she'd left the knife in the bedroom. The question was... if she pleaded guilty, why was she lying? The autopsy proved that the injuries were inflicted with the right hand. And Minerva is left-handed. But Minerva hurt her hand when she killed Mauro. A small percentage of lefties do certain things with their right hand. Such as brushing their teeth, handling a knife. You didn't know Gloriana. She took care of me. She was everything to me. And I was her only friend. She kicked me out that day. But she isn't bad. It's ancient history. Forget about Rodrigo. Okay? You deserve someone better. I don't like seeing you like this, don't cry. Rodrigo doesn't love you. Shut up, of course he loves me. You don't know what love is, fucking orphan, you didn't even have parents. You want me to leave him so I'm alone like you, right? -Don't start. -I can't stand you anymore, get out. I'm sick of you. Grab your stuff and go. I let you stay at my place, and you can't even pay your share. [scoffs] I told you I'd pay. There's no need. I collected already. What? I sold that pathetic owl that used to be your mom's. -Did you think I'd keep you for free? -No, you're lying. At least your inheritance served for something, right? Liar. -I don't want to see you crying. -Please, stop. Get out, Minerva, get out. You'd better not be here when I get up. [Minerva] I cried myself to sleep. And when I woke up, I thought it had all been a dream. [Minerva] I took a shower, made the bed... tidied up my room. And waited until it was time to leave. But first, I went back to see her. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I can't get Mauro out of my head. His face. He didn't know what was going to happen to him. We were wrong, and an innocent boy is dead. There's nothing you could've done. It's not your fault. You did your job. You're a good cop. I shouldn't have gone back to your place. -It was a mistake. -This isn't about us. Last night had nothing to do with it. Mrs. Solari said he wasn't violent. His mother would've done anything to protect him. -You don't know that. -Yes. Yes, I do. Inés gave her granddaughter a false alibi. Jenny and Rodrigo kept their relationship secret. Estela Solari would've also lied for her son. Everyone lies. That's not what matters. Finding out who tells the truth, in the slightest gesture, with some piece of information... that's our job. [line ringing] Fito... where are you? Call me. We have a problem. -Fito was attacked -What? -Is he okay? -Yes, yes, just a few bruises. But he's in observation at Santa Ana Hospital. At Santa Ana? -Who was it? -I don't know. But I bet it was the Sixth. They took the footage where Juánez appears. No, that makes no sense. If it's as Fito said, and the footage proves he's innocent, why would they steal it? Fito only saw the main entrance camera footage, but he sent us more. These are from the hospital parking lot. This is on us. -Calm down. -We both know what happened. These cameras show him driving the car that killed Galván, that's why he sent people for it. He tricked us. It was him. Where is he? We have a copy, and he doesn't know. It's enough to open an investigation, but Juánez is a cop, there are procedures. What procedures are you talking about? Tell me where he is. We're looking for him, that's why I came. I'm going to put you under watch and ask you to stay home until we find him. You lost him? He killed Galván, stole the evidence, and you lost him? We were wrong. -I also thought he was innocent. -But he did it. You know it, everyone knows it. Yes, and I'll take care of it. But by now, he must be on to you, and no one knows where he is, or what he's capable of doing. And I won't let any one else in my team get hurt. You can't leave me out of this. Yes, I can. You're off the case. [Roger] We're running out of time, Juánez. Have you thought about my offer? You have to make this end today. I'll take care of the case. Okay. Be there in an hour. I have a copy of the footage, and Pelari is out. [knocking at door] Perfect. Yes? Sir, Galván's next of kin is waiting for you. Let him in. Come in. -Come in, please. -[Zorro] Excuse me. Thanks, María, I'll let you know if I need anything. Here's evidence it was the cop. -Give me the photos. -Where is he? I just spoke to him. We're meeting in an hour. He doesn't suspect a thing, he thinks I'll offer him a deal. Make it look like a mugging. Here are the originals of the photos. But the deal ends with the cop's death. Say he was mugged, and the pictures are yours. Not earlier. And how do I know you won't keep a copy to use it against me again? All I want is justice for my brother's death. You'll have to trust me. [suspenseful music playing] What are you doing here? It was you. -Why did you kill him? -Pipa. You don't know anything. I can't believe you killed Patricio. -I don't want anymore lies. -You're right about that. Someone has to start telling the truth here. Investigating you for Galván's death was my job. Everything you did was work? Don't do this. -Come with me, tell them what you did. -I can't. -Juánez, please. If I were you-- -But you're not me. Want to know what's going on? Stay here. What are you doing? I believed you. But you're a murderer. A traitor. You've gotten this far. If I go with you, you'll never know what's going on. You gonna go by the book or do you want to know the truth? [motorcycles approaching] If you want me to stay, talk to me. Explain what's going on. All right. But I can't right now, you have to hide. Now. [motorcycle engines rev] Where's Roger? Your friend, the DA? He sold you out for some compromising photos. You're wrong. He sold you out for some compromising photos. But, the way I see it, you still have a choice. See back there? He's aiming at your head. Tell your friend to lower his gun and we can talk calmly. [Zorro] No. -If he shoots, you're dead. -If he shoots... we're both dead. I'm offering you a chance. -You killed my brother. -And your brother killed my wife. We're even, Zorro. This doesn't have to end bad. Give me the DA's pictures and scram. If he shoots now, what do you think will happen? I don't care. But whatever you start here, won't end here. Think about your mother... about your family. Do you understand? Give me the photos. -Freeze, police! -[gun shot] -[groans] -[gun shot] -Get up, I'll help you. Come on. -I can't breathe. I can't breathe. [Velcro tearing] Was he hit? How is he? It's a heart attack, call an ambulance. This is Officer Ordóñez, officer down, send an ambulance. -[slashing noise] -[groans] [gun shot] [harmonica melody playing] [reporter on TV] Prosecutor, how's Inspector Juánez? [Roger] He's in a delicate state, but he'll survive. He's in the best of hands. [reporter] Prosecutor Roger, a police officer and a criminal died, Inspector Juánez is in critical condition, what went wrong? [Roger] No, no. Nothing went wrong. In the fight against crime, there are situations that are impossible to handle. And the courage of our men, who risk their lives for truth and justice, is something we should value. The work conducted by Juánez and his team has been impeccable. They dismantled an underground network a stolen auto parts we'd been investigating for a long time. [reporter] Sir, your name has come up for the Attorney General position. [Roger] I'm sorry, but this isn't the time to speak about that. Positions aren't what's important. I'm a loyal defender of justice and I'll keep being one from whichever position I'm in. [monitors beeping steadily] -Thanks. -Are you all right? Yes. And you? He's been hiding his heart condition for a year. He was on the edge all this time. Roger says you saved his life. Zorro wanted to kill him. He was convinced he did it and he wanted to avenge his brother. If it hadn't been for you, Juánez would be dead. Ordóñez is dead. [Rodolfo sighs] We still haven't found the red car. But the Sixth has a lead. They think it was a drunk driver. You were right. Juánez is innocent. [Pipa] What's your secret? [Juánez] If I told you, it would no longer be a secret. [Pipa] To be good at this, I need to know. Isn't that what our job is about? [Juánez] To be good at this, you'd have to find out. Don't you think? YOUNG STORE CLERK THAT ACCIDENTALLY KILLED COP'S WIFE IS RELEASED FROM PRISON [Rodolfo] If this happened to me, with someone in my family, I'd also want revenge. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOMMY [Roger] They call it loyalty, but it's corruption. LUSETTI DRIVING SCHOOL DIPLOMA [cell phone ringing] [Pipa] It's unfair they think you're guilty. Why don't you defend yourself? [Juánez] His mother would've done anything to protect him. -[Pipa] You don't know that. -[Juánez] Yes. Yes, I do. Everyone lies. Finding out who tells the truth, in the slightest gesture, with some piece of information... that's our job. Take the new girl. You're coming with us as Mariani's replacement.
