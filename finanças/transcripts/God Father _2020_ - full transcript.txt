One day, A dog was standing far and looking at Lion feasting on a prey! ...once the Lion finishes the food, the dog ate the remains... The Lion sees this but ignores the dog! Then everyday, the Dog survived with the remains of Lion's food One day, the Dog got an idea. The Lion is not attacking, so why to eat the remain? With that thought, it decides to feast along with Lion! So the dog, is now close to the Lion. The Lion got pissed and thrashed the dog with little life left behind. The bitten dog, decides to avenge Lion... So it formed a team of dogs and waited to strike the Lion! They tried to overcome Lion but were defeated! Do you know why? Because, it's just a dog!

Marudhu didn't know that we provoked Selva to attack him, Selva was murdered before exposing us, So we should be on alert and take down Marudhu first. Even a slightest slip will lead to our deaths! Hey, Stop there. Brother, lots of pending work in pipeline. There is some problem inside, so don't go in. - If I leave, I can only fix it next month... - Leave now, Marudhu is here...

Karuna... ...Don't know what happened and doctors are not giving clear picture. Karuna... Karuna... Madam, Haven't you left yet? I told you that your son will not survive, take him to Government hospital. He's my only son and we have waited long enough! Do you know that? Sir, He's new here and he don't know about you. You son's heart is not functioning proper... ...he easily gets tired, he's not active like other kids... ...and all because of his ailing heart condition. It's too late for any medications. The only solution is heart transplant. But, you know that he got rare blood group... It's hard to get a donor at same age group. Even if we find one, waiting list is long. So... Sorry Sir... Sir. If a donor of same blood group and right age... ...met with accident and hospitalised... ...and declared brain dead,... then that donor can save your son. Karuna... Bro... Yes bro... Guna, I don't care how many you will kill, but I want my son to live. Ok bro, Sure. I will take care. Your magical smile does wonders in my life! You added colours in our life with your presence! You are the serene tune of my life! You inspire us to love the universe! You are my solace and you are my dreams! Every word you utter, sprinkles like raindrops! Every sound you make are the boons of the day! The depth of our life depends on your smile! And I thank almighty for your presence! I will protect you till my last breath! I will keep you in my heart till it beats! Life is a puzzle... Living is the solution! Our life depends on you my son! - So, everything going good? - Yes Sir! Then why don't you sell this and buy a new house? Sir, this house is my lucky charm. Arjun was born here... ...also we got used to this lovely neighbourhood, so we will not move away. You will never listen to me! Thank you sir! - Ok Bye, - Bye Sir. - Hello - Sir, This is Bala. - Bala? - Sir, you came for your son's blood test. Yeah, but doctor's cleared that there is no issue. Sir, it's not about that... ...Marudhu's men came and took your son's report. Marudhu's Men? But why?
