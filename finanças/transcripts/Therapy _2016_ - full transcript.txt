What a mover, what style, a real charmer. Stop with your Van, you're getting on my nerves. She's obsessed. Look at this, it's cool. It's the same at home. Did you bring the stencils? Nope. So how exactly are we going to do this...? Right. Hand me the white. I'll go over it all. - Here you go. - Thank you. - And be careful! - Will do. I heard something weird up This place gives me the creeps. So you saw a mirror then? What? Your reflection... Pretty creepy if you ask me. William, let me have a sip Will! Chill... she's not a kid! What have you done with the white? I must have left it upstai Sorry, I'll go get it. Forget it! I'm really sorry. It's not a big deal. Why don't I just go and get it for you. Stop being such a jerk. I'll go. Amanda! Amanda! Amanda! AMANDA! AMANDA! - Evening. - Evening. - You do the nightshif - Yes. I'm Jane, Official Investigator, CID. Could you go over what you said to my colleagues? Sure, it was early evening. I was doing my usual round with the dog. He shot off into the woods. I ran after him and ended up at this house. And? I went in and there was a camera tri-pod. In one room I saw ... I saw kid's toys and blood on the walls. I carried on looking and found a box under the sink, all covered up. It was the smell of petrol that made me suspicious. That's where the cameras were. You've never been in this house before? No. I've had this job two days. They're planning to build a golf course. So I'm here to keep an eye on things whilst they get the land fenced off. Ok. Have you told anyone apart from the police? No, but I'd better tell the boss. We'll do that. Come to the station tomorrow with his details and I'll get you to sign a statement. No point in panicking anyone, until we see what the lab turns up on the blood and take a look at those cameras. Hi. Hi. Well, here's our next case. Seb, you could at least give us a hand! Can I put my bag down by my feet? If there's room. It's fine. Let's go. Come on Seb, get in! Ok, all set? - Yeah! - All set. We're off! What are you filming? Just the view. Why the camera? Are you going to do that the whole time Seb, I told you, you can film your school project but you have to spend some time with us too, ok? I think it's fun! Everyone ok back there? It's fine. She's fast asleep. We should arrive in a couple of hours. Steph, is it here? No, I told you, I think we need to turn round... Alright, but... - Keep going up and we should get t - Fuck, shit... I told you, but you didn't listen did you? He didn't listen. I did, but you've been saying any old thing for the last hour or so... Is she still asleep? Yes. At least somebody round here is relaxed. Ta-dah! - Ta-dah what? Are we actually he - Yep, we've made it! Is this it? Don't you start, Sam. Wake up Olivia and help unload the car. Hang on, let me park first! What are you doing? Wait a second. But... Seb, the perfect subject for your film project! - Fuck! - You should have seen your face! - You pain in the... - Come on, it was just a bit of fu Hey, instead of whining grab thi Here you go honey. Seb can't you carry something? Don't put yourself out or anything, and make sure you get my good side. Wow, it's great here. Yeah, really cool. Everyone's got a bag? Hang on... My favorite little niece! This looks like a good place, doesn't it Yeah! Is it ok here, Steph? Sure. Shall we set up here then? Yeah, let's set up the camp. All good? It's great. - Right here. - Ok. - View of the tree or over the val - Valley. I sleep along the edge. Hey Seb, get a move on with your stuff will you? Seb... Leave it to the lady of the house. Well, we're done! Us too! - Can I come and see? - Sure. Hey, take off your shoes! Sorry... I've just cleaned in there. Get out! I can't stand it! Really sorry. - Wait, just wait. - No, you've got to be Girls, sshh... please. - What is it? - Just stay quiet for a minute. Did you hear that? Hey, calm down. I don't know. - I don't know, but I find it stra - What? Can't you hear? Somebody's screaming? Don't know. It sounds like it's coming from over there. Hey, it's nothing. Just some youngsters messing around. He scared me for a minute there. ... Come back Seb, it's ok. It's just some kids fooling around. Stay with us, put the camera down for a bit. Do you think we made a mistake coming here? That looks like.... a private road to me. So, that's where you are? Shit. Are you alright? Nothing's missing? - Hum... just a photo of Steph. - What? - You told me that you'd never take - I must have forgotten to put it I cleaned the car yesterday, for fuck's sake. - It's ok. - No, it's not. I really don't feel It's ok. It starts. It just one of those things. You're right. Even so, it seems odd to me. With dumb teenagers about, it's not odd at all. Do you want to know what I really think? Go ahead! Feeling the pressure now? You think we did it? We've been here all the time. How could we do it? Come off it.... so what, a bear just strolled in and took it? Don't annoy me Sam... I'm warning you. That's enough. I'll cover your car with mud, see how you like it, then... Steven, calm down. It pisses me off. Pathetic joke. Honey, come back. You two keep a low profile. I'll talk to him, ok? Ok. Are you coming Seb? Let's forget it. Nice little holiday. Any fingerprints? Nothing, everything's been wiped clean. And the blood on the walls? Human. Just waiting for DNA results. I've got the next section of fi Great. All of it? Unfortunately not. Some of it's damaged and super 8 format takes ages. Don't worry, I've got two guys at the lab, we'll get there. Any chance of dating this stuff? A date? Yeah, I heard you. Ok, I'll ask. Anyone for a coffee? Two please. Ok. Anthony? I'm off then. - See you "laters"! - "Laters"... Well, at least we have the next bit of footage. So tell me then... What? Why are we there? Steven's my uncle and he suggested we go camping with friends. And Stephanie is his girlfriend. And Sam is my best friend. Nothing else to say really. Whatever. You got your small camera on you? The Go-pro? No, it's in the tent. - Yeah, sure. All done. - Thank you. Your turn Sam. What do you make of the car and all that. Nobody's hurt and nothing got stolen so it's alright. What about Steph's photo? Steven said he forgot to put it back. I don't think he's lying unless he's just trying to spare Stephan She's over-sensitive. I guess what annoys me is that he seems convinced we did it. When we were with them the whole day. What do you think of this place? I actually really like it. I know I tend to complain a lot, but I feel good here. This? It was a present from my grandmother. Can I go back now? Nothing else to say? Nope. Off you go then. Thanks! I'll look again just before we head for bed. Ok. So you filmed that did you, Seb? The car? That's enough. - That's the highlight or your day - Stop it. There's nothing better going on around here for you to film. Steven! ... Oh my God! She's crazy. Hey, stop that. Look! What if we make a camp-fire? - Great. - Brillant! - Good idea? - Let's do it. I've even brought some marshmallows. Pass me the marshmallows. - One each for now. - "Gracie". - Hey Seb, what are you up to? - Come and join us. Can I have your marshmallow then? You forgot to bring the guitar. - I don't know how to play, so... - Me neither. Somebody should have remembered the guitar, not mentioning any names. You always have to have a go at me. Must be love...? Yes, it's love. Seb, don't you want to come with us? Come on, just for a bit. Story anyone? - How about a horror story? - Go on then. "A creepy, horror story". Yes, something scary... "A story like that..." "A story like that..." What was that? I don't know. It sounded like earlier. That doesn't reassure me. Why did you do that? It's ok. I told you. It's just some kids messing around in the valley. It sucks. It is a bit weird though. At least it calmed them down. That's quite enough excitement for one day. Let's head for bed. - Good idea. - Yep, let's go. You coming, Seb? Come on! Let's put the fire out, ok? Yes, put it out. Don't worry. Are you going to be able to relax? Seb, go on... It's a bit creepy. It sure is. Sam, the mind can play tricks. True. Let's try to relax. - Fuck, Seb y - Ahh... Fuck! Leave it out with the camera, will you? Just give me some space. Why don't you go and annoy the girls? - What? - What? Nothing. Go easy with the light! What's the betting... our tents will be full of mud in the morning? Watch for the bears. Seb, what are you up to? I dunno, just a few short shots here and there. - Cool... - Yes? - Seb's going to end up sleeping o - Yeah! Can you hear that? Can you hear that? Can you hear that? What? It's kicking off again. Seb...? Bloody hell Seb, why bring your camera? It's not a game, Seb. - Why are you awake? - Sshh.... listen! Fuck, what is that? Out, out now...! For fuck's sake, what's wrong with you? Shit, you're crazy. That's quite enough Mr. Camera. Seb squealed like a little girl. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. No, I just.... It's been going on for over an hour now. - Shall we go take a look? - Yes, why not? No. - Hang on, I'll grab a torch first - Ok. - Stop. I don't like this at all. - I got it. What? I feel really uneasy about this. Come on Steph! We'll just take a quick look that's all. Steven, you don't get it. What? I'm scared. - Come on! It's nothing. - No! It will be a laugh. - Steven will protect you. - Of course. You're really seriously thinking of going? - Sure. - We'll go take a look. Come on! No point in looking at me like th I'm not coming. Off you go. - So you prefer to stay here all o - Go on, off you go if you have to. - You'd rather stay here all alone - Are you going or what? Yes, we're off! Come, you're not staying here? I'll wait here. Fuck... Have fun. We'll try! - Come on! You sure? - I'll be fine. Leave her. She's sulking now. Do you think it's coming from over there? It's over there. Let's get closer. I think we should get out of here. Nah, Sam, let's take a look. It will be a laugh. Do you think somebody's there? I don't know, it seems to be coming from near here. A derelict house, maybe it's a squat. Come on, let's take a look upstairs. Olivia? I'd really like to get some images with the Go-pro. - Could you get on it? - Isn't one camera enough? If we find something up there, it would be cool to have more than one angle. Don't get ahead of yourself Seb... - ...there's probably nothing to see. - Yeah. Olivia, please? It's for my student project! Ok. Who's coming with me? Ok. So where do you want it? On my head? That would be great. Don't get eaten by the big, bad Now that would be a shame. Steph? Steph, are you ok? ... Hey! You're not sulking are you? Steph? Well... Ok. See you later then... Hey, have you gone up without me Hey? It's me. Are you there? Sam? Steven, I know you there. Come on, I can see you. Oh.... Steven? Who's there? Olivia! We thought you'd gone too! What? Is Steph with you? Tell me she's with you. I don't understand. We came back here and Steph's gone. No mobiles either. I... I.. What is it? Olivia, Stephanie has disappeared. I don't understand, I... I..I heard somebody over there. Where? At the squat! Somebody was moving around. So Steph didn't come with you? - No! No, she didn't! - Oh, SHIT! I've still got my mobile. STEVEN. It's Steph. Steph... STEPHANIE What do we do? Olivia, call the police. Then we have to find her! Ok, ok! STEPHANIE Come on! No more battery. How come?! - Steven, I'm sorry, it's not my f - Give it to me, give it to me. There's no point getting cross, Steven. We'll have to search for her. - Let's go. Now! - Yes, let's go. No, not that way, It didn't come from the squat. It came from the forest. STEPH! Olivia, keep the Go-pro on, ok? What? Please. Sebastien, Stephanie has gone. It's serious. That's why we'll need all the proof we can get, if somebody's kidnapped her. Ok. I will keep it on. You start filming when I say... and you'll not stop, ok? Ok So, we have a missing person. Were a lot of the images damaged? Mostly from the Go-pro. It must have had some kind of impact. As for dating it all, we've got something. The 25th September, two days ago. Ok, we need to get a move on. We may have a missing person here. Have you got the next bit of film? Here it is. That's why I came over. - - It's all yours. - - Right. How many minutes on it roughly? Ten, twenty minutes, didn't hav Just brought it straight from editing. Here are the first rushes of the super 8 too. Alright, but hurry up. Sorry but we do... Stop making excuses Anthony! Just get it done as fast as you ca Understood? Fuck, now we're really getting far from the tents. What's this? STEPHANIE! We keep going. Where are we? It's huge. Steven, what's the plan? We find Stephanie and we get out of here. Ok? Totally. Olivia, switch on the Go-pro please ... Wait! ... What is it? I saw somebody... at the window. Listen, I just saw somebody. It's Stephanie's bracelet. Fuck. Steven. We've got to get in. Yes. Can we get in there? STEPHANIE ... Wow! - Come on! - She might not even be in there! Listen Sam, if you're frightened, you stay here while we go in. Stephanie? This is serious, Steven. We'd be better off getting help. Sam, don't start acting like at the squat. Stephanie? Why don't you listen to me? Steph...! You're not listening to me, fuck. Where do we go? This way. Steven, Olivia! Olivia... We can't stay here. We have to leave. - I've just seen... - Come! Fuck. It's unbelievable. - What the hell is this? - I don't know. No... Steph? That's the photo from your car, isn Shit, shit, no, not th : STEPHANIE! We're going back down and get the police, right? What the hell is going on? STEVEN Did you hear that? It's her. We have to find her. Steph!? What the...? Hey, who are you? No... Fuck, get out... now! Now! Hurry, hurry! ... What the hell is this? Anthony? Anthony? I need you to run a check to see if somebody has been reported missing. Her's her photo. She's called Stephanie, about 25. It looks like she has been kidnapped. There may be other potential victims too. I took a screen shot of a wall covered with photos of women. Check them out will you? We might get some positive IDs. We need to check the archives too for any information on the group. One of them might have a record. So, not only do we have Stephanie but also Steven, 30. Plus three teenagers... Here are Samantha and Olivia. The third is Sebastien. Between 14 and 17. Sebastien's studying Film, so look into local schools, see if anything comes up. Ok? Your films. Great, thanks a lot. See? We are doing our best. Thank you. Sorry about earlier. I can count on you then? Sure. Cheers. Women. Got the next bit of film. They are running checks on Stephanie and the others. It was premeditated. The screams, the car, the squat... the idea was to get Stephanie. All planned. Of course he knew that she would be alone in the tent. Hang on Simon, those women, the photos, do you think they are all dead? A serial killer? I'm not leaving without Steph. I'm sure there must be another way out. We need to find some kind of weapon. I... I'll check to see if there's a fire exit. Who are you? HELP ME.... PLEASE! What are you doing here? What's happened? Are you bleeding? Are you hurt? What's your name? My name is Amanda, I think I'm ok. I don't know if it's my blood but, he killed my friends. What? How long have you been here? No idea. Who is this man? He's the one who lays down the law. Did you see Stephanie? No. Do you think she's alive? If she is, she'll be upstairs, on the third floor. Is there any way up apart from this corridor? No, I don't want to go back there. Please help me. Sshh, we may have to. Is the man alone? I've only seen him. And the photos, who are they? His victims. We have to find Steph. We must go. Wether or not your friend is alive, we have to stay here and be quiet or else he'll find us. Look. We're about to change the rules. Ok? - But you can't. - Yes we can. Steven, where are you going? Where do you think? - Wait, wait! - It's suicide. Listen! We need to stick together, ok? - Seb, you with me? - Yes. - Let's go. - Ok. What is it? Shit. We can still get past. Just don't make any noise. Switch off the lights and stay quiet. We can do this. We can't. Amanda, come back. Amanda! Amanda, come back! Seb... RUN... RUN! He's playing with them. Ok guys, breaking news, Stephanie has a criminal record. Stephanie Laurent, convicted for manslaughter, car accident. Yes? Anything else? No family in the area but, she has been receiving psychological treatment by court order. And I've got the doctor's details here. Ok, get him to come in straight aw and let the family know. I'll send you a screenshot of a teenager her name is Amanda. See if you can come up with anything. Ok. Anything on the others? Nowt. But I found the address of the abandoned building. A team in on its way. Great. Let's go. What's the point? Look, it's gone 10 and we've been here since 6 this morning. Let them get on with it. It's not our job to go in there. We'll just get in the way. He's right. You two really piss me off. What the problem? Hello...? What are you calling me for? I told you not to. You want to know where I am? I'm in a fucking, shitty motel room and all because of you. Get it? No, no, it's over. I've got a lawyer. I want a divorce. Don't even think of contacting me again. "Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. Promise" "Go FUCK yourself" Hi. Fine. I'll leave you to it. We got hold of Stephanie's psychologist. He should be here around 11. Great. How's the editing going? We're getting on with it, a bit more than half done. Meaning? Meaning we are on the job! - Get a move on. - Right. Anything from the neighbors? Yeah, a few of complained about noise, coming from the road leading into the forest. Basically we've narrowed it down to 3 houses. One where a big family lives, but they are away on holiday apparently, so I doubt if they heard anything. - Hardly likely. Funny that... - Funny that! So, on the second owned by a Mrs Fletcher, 94, who said she didn't hear anything but then again she doesn't even know what day it is. Leaving? Leaving Abigail Parker. She lives at the end of the road, and may have seen something. Ok. Find her and bring her in. Already done. Hang on, before you go. I don't know what's on it but the editing guys seemed a bit put out. - Hi. - Hi. You ok? Right, we got the next bit of film and two witnesses, the psychologist and a certain Abigail Parker. A neighbor who may have heard something. They are both coming in this morning. Ok... I saw the Chief earlier. And it looks like we are pretty much on our own for this one. Why? Most of the men are helping search for the young girl Kendra, who went missing on the week-end. Fucking brilliant... Shit! Stephanie - You ok? - Olivia! - Are you hurt? - Olivia! What has he done to you? What's happening? OLIVIA! What's going on, Olivia? Calm down. It's ok. It's ok. Are you hurt? Help me. We will find the others. Ok? I'm scared. Fucking hell Steven, what do we do now? Olivia and Sam? I don't know. I don't know. We can't help them from here. Stephanie. Listen to me. Do you know any other way out? Steven? Right, we are going to find the others. Come on, that's it. Follow me. And don't make any noise. Ok? Come on. What are you doing? Come on...! Switch it off. I can't... Look Steph, we have to go down. Just follow me. Fucking hell. No... What's wrong? The door is locked. He's locked us in. - What? - He's locked us in. Come on... come on! Shit! No! Hold this. Shine it so I can see. NO! SHIT! Hey, what are you doing? Steven... No! We can't stop now. Steph, Stephanie get up! You must get up. We have to get out of here. We can make it. I promise. We can do this. Please... Ok, get up Steph! NOW! NOW! Come on! NO! Don't give up! You can't do this to me. Steph, get up! Please! Get up NOW! You can't give up! Come on now, calm down. Steven, what are you doing? I need to know who he is. I fucking need to know, alright I don't get it. I don't get it. Steven, what do you think you'll fi His passport or something? I just want to know why. Why us, ok? 3 a.m. All we have found are prescriptions. No closer to knowing who this madman is. What the hell are you doing Sebastien? What...? What are you up to? A logbook, for fuck's sake? No... We're in the shit and you know it... And you carry on fucking filming? It's all we've got. It's the only kind of real proof we have Maybe you know more than you're letting on? Take a look at this. Just take a look at this lot. This must have been a mental asylum. Get it? New patients... Remember Amanda? She's like one of his patients. So that's why we are here. Steven... Steven, get a grip. What are we going to do? Steven, what are we going to do? We're out of here. We're getting out. Now. I'll go down, find the girls and I'll get the bastard. You head up the fourth floor and look for a way out. You go up and I go down, right? No, we should stick together. You go up... up..up You go up and I'm heading down. Get it? Just fucking do as I say will you? GO UP... UP.... UP Shit, he's lost the He wants me to get o I'll get out. Ok, need a ladder. That's it... a ladder Now it's murder... The girl who jumped in the bunker do you think she's dead too? No idea. Who are all these women? None seem to have been reported missing. Where the hell is getting them from? I don't know but they could be from anywhere. Tourists... maybe they are not even from this area. He leaves them in a bunker to die in agony like that. Who is this bastard? I've never seen anything like it. Jane, get a grip. Please! Take a deep breath. Stay with me. I need you on this, ok? Ok. Ok. We've... We have to see the rest of the film. What can you give me? No, I've got something else... God knows what state we'll find the others in. We don't even know if they are still alive. Hey guys. The psychologist is here. He's waiting. Did they find any other bodies in the building? No, just this one. Nothing else at all? No... I... I'm heading back to the lab. - Anthony! - Yes? Look at the last footage. There's a concrete bunker with dead women in it. We really need to find where it is, in case Olivia is still in there. She could be alive. Ok, I'm on to it. Thank you. Right, I'll deal with the psychologist and you talk to Abigail Parker. Ok. We have to find out more. The psychologist is our only lead to Stephanie for the moment. I think he could shed some light on all of this. Good morning. Are you Richard Spencer? Yes. Do you know why you are there? Because I am the Stephanie Laurent's psychologist? Precisely. I'm Jane. I need to know more about her. How long has she been your patient? Almost three years. Since her sister died. What happened? A car accident. Stephanie was driving. Right. Is there something wrong with Stephanie? She's gone missing. You must know quite a lot about her. Her behavior, for example. What was she like? She came to see me every Thursday afternoon. You do realize there is a limit to what I can tell you about her. Patient confidentiality and all that? Listen. Her life and maybe others are in balance here. So, you're going to have to tell me everything. Understood? It was slow-going with Stephanie. And you didn't find it strange that she failed to turn up for her appointment, last Thursday? Did you try to reach her at all? It wouldn't have been the first time she missed an appointment. In fact it happened often and she never bothered to cancel. I see. What about friends? Her family? She did not like talking about them. She was a bit of a loner. It was hard to persuade her to go out, meet people. And yet she did go away last week-end. What about her work? She hasn't really stuck at anything since the accident. Fine. Thank you for your help. If Stephanie gets in touch or you think of even the slightest thing that could be useful, I want you to contact me, ok? Of course. I'm here to help. Excuse me for a minute. Not really here to help, is he? No. Not exactly talkative. You're the one who needs help if you ask me. Good morning, Are you Abigail Parker? Yes. Right, good. I need to know everything you rem about the evening of the 25th September. It's difficult my French isn't I was at home. I was asleep. And I woke up hearing somebody outside on the road screaming. Yes, that's right. Are you positive? Yes. Mrs Parker, I need to know exactl what happened that evening. I heard noise down in my garden. And? Then somebody was banging on my Really loud. I was in my bed. I was scared but came downstairs anyway and they were there... They... : beg... They begged me to let them in. So I did. What happened next? The youngest was covered in blood. So I told her she could use the bathroom to clean herself. I looked for some blankets and went to make them a cup of tea... to help calm them down. Why didn't you call the police? I was going to but when I went back into the lounge, they'd gone. So why didn't you get onto the police anyway? I'm sorry. I realize now that I should have but... at that time I didn't know what to do. It was as if they'd never been there. I didn't want to come across as a liar or some kind of... crazy woman. Crazy? What do you mean by that? : I take pills. I... I take pills. And sometimes I see things. You mean, you think you might have imagined it all? Look. I even "see" my husband sometimes. But it's impossible, I know that he died you see. But it's so real when he's there again. Who prescribes these pills? I work in a hospital. So you help yourself, is that what you're saying? I really need these pills. You're not going tell them are : You're not gonna tell th I need this job. Let's start with a full description of t people who came to your house that night Ok. ... At least we know that two may have survived. The descriptions she gave don't match. She's not right, is she? She told you herself. She steals pills from work. She's unhinged. I must let the hospital know. Don't you think we should be getting on with something more import Hello? Ok. Great... thanks. They've got the next section of film. It's downloaded on my computer. Sam?! Sam... Blood... Sam? I'm coming... Sam What's this...? Seb.... Sam! Help me! - Help me Seb! - Are you ok? - Help me Seb! - Sam, what....? What the hell has happened? Sam, I'm here now...

I'll check to see if there's any news on the photos of the women and what's happening on site. Ok. I'll watch the film again. I'm sure we've missed something. I don't believe this. Where is everyone? Jane? Simon what's going on? Where is everyone? Searching for Kendra, the missing kid.... remember? Any news on the other women? Those we have been able to identify are in fact all on missing persons' list The abandoned building was once part of a massive psychiatric unit. It hasn't been active for 30 years. It's really huge and we still haven't located the bunker. Yes? Anthony, where the hell are you? I'm part of the search team. What about the films? I couldn't find you so I left them at the reception. Ok, ok... What is it? Simon? All we really have to go on is the psychologist. I'm going to his office and checking out his file on Stephanie. I'll watch the next film. Wait, Simon! We haven't got a warrant. You can't just turn up at his office? See you back at your motel. Is anyone there? HELP! PLEASE! OPEN UP! PLEASE! It's unlocked. Get in! HELP! There's a light on. Please!
