Politicians say that what happened in Nazi Germany must never happen again. Meanwhile, the fascist movement is regrouping in front of our eyes. Racist parties are represented in governments all around Europe- -ranging from the Danish People's Party and Progress Party in our neighboring countries- -to Hungary's Jobbik and Front National in France. When right-wing extremism is normalized in the debate, the playing field is skewed- -clearing space for violent groups like Party of Swedes and the Swedish Resistance Movement. "Yet another building supposed to house refugees has gone up in flames in Sweden." "Sweden will remain Swedish! Sieg Heil!" "Activities of racist organizations at a record high..." "Nazis attacked families with children." "Sieg heil!" "British politician Jo Cox was killed by what appears to be a British nationalist." "Neo-Nazi settlements gaining strength..." "At least 84 people were killed at a youth camp outside Oslo." "The artist was murdered by Greece's ultra right-wing Golden Dawn party." If Europe wasn't burning once again- -I would have wanted to talk to you about trees. About my childhood climbing adventures. About the birches outside my window. But now I have to talk about the growing fascism instead. A few months earlier, an anti-racist demonstration in Kärrtorp was attacked- -by armed fascists from the Swedish Resistance Movement. One of those defending the demonstration, pushing the fascists back out into the woods- -has been sentenced for rioting. More are likely to be prosecuted. We organized a demonstration since we spotted a lot of Nazi graffiti. Especially along the 17th metro line. It kept coming back. They painted it, we cleaned it up, and so on. So we wanted to stand up and say that this is not something we want in our suburb. We wanted to send a clear message to them, that they weren't welcome here. So we organized the demonstration as a protest against the graffiti. We got information about it two weeks ahead of the demonstration. At that time, we only knew that a Nazi had posted a plead online- -for others to go to Kärrtorp and organize a counter demonstration. The platform was here. I was standing here, as I was next up to speak. That's when they appeared. At first, I didn't grasp what was about to happen. But when a pal of mine, with her husband and children, suddenly packed their stroller- -and ran off, as in a panic, I understood that something was off. It started with loud bangs, from some kind of firework. I heard a guy shouting: "Stick together!" Chaos erupted. People didn't know what to do. It spread among us as well. People got disoriented. We were scattered across the square. We started gathering in the outskirts of the demonstration in order to face the Nazis. The police panicked, running around in a mess, collecting their gear and helmets. So the first thing I saw when I got to the front- -was police officers fleeing as the Nazis approached. I thought to myself that we were screwed. I knew that about 15 of us would be prepared to defend the demonstration. Luckily, more than that joined up. At the time, however, I didn't know that and was convinced we'd have to take the first hit. That's when I saw their knives. And I thought, rather them than us. Of course I'd rather see one of them go down than one of my friends. That's when I felt that I had to respond somehow. Our fear that the attacks will result in more than bruises is justified. We know this, because 14 people in Sweden have been murdered by Nazis since 1999. Watch me do it! Okay, face each other. I start off hitting here, and then go here. To the side and then back off. Use the uppercut and then the hook. -Only the one? -Both. Here we train self-defense tactics. Lately, more and more fascists are appearing in Athens. We're trying to improve ourselves. To retake the streets from the fascists. So that in the end there won't be any fascists in the streets any longer. If possible, we try to always be ready. Each one of us work on our own level, trying to get better. To achieve this, we have to train everyday. Eventually, maybe we won't have to see any fascist at all. The knife comes either from below or above. He'll come in as he wants, from a distance. Kick back the attacker and back away. If I'm closer, kick and then back off. Grab the knife, hit and twist. Hit him, take him down- -and take the knife. One at a time. Fascism is a complex phenomenon. There isn't always a single, universal explanation as to why it grows. In Norway, for example, fascism is on the rise despite a booming economy. But in Greece, fascism is clearly a symptom of the crisis. Early on in, the electoral support for Golden Dawn stood at 0,4 %. They barely existed. And then the crisis hit. Suddenly, they grew to 8 %. I witnessed their rise with my own eyes. Fleets of illegal immigrants are coming to conquer our country. Crooks want to sweep up our wealth. Where are all the investments? Areas are being ravaged. The local workers know this. That's why they joined us. Golden Dawn is their only protection. Don't be fooled into believing fascism arises like a virus, infecting people. It's not like that. It doesn't arise from below. Fascism starts from above. The events in Greece prove that. Suddenly, a technocrat, a bank chief, took control of the country. A non-elected official who kept pushing through cuts. Eventually, the anger took a different route. Instead of being focused upwards, it was redirected downwards. Having initially blamed EU, the Troika and Greek politicians- -people suddenly started blaming undocumented immigrants. Blaming those poor people looking through the trash for the crisis. The change was palpable, anger instead redirected downwards. One similarity between fascism in Greece and Sweden- -is the shared problem of "street fascism", with knife attacks on the streets. Golden Dawn is the third largest party in Greece, Sweden Democrats the third largest in Sweden. They operate with a parliamentary wing and a street wing, harassing people there. In Greece, however, those are two wings of the same organization. In Sweden, there's been a separation. One wing pretends to be respectable. Another is active in the streets. The Sweden Democrats have gone full circle. They were born out of the Neo-Nazi movement. Many other populist parties around Europe don't share that extreme past- -which makes them among the worst of those parties, in that respect. The extreme right is powerful, gaining ground in parliaments. Just look at the White House today. But as they grow, a movement to counter them grows in the streets. We'll see an offensive in all areas of the public space. When my friends and I defend ourselves, media portray us as the same as Nazis. We would rather be writing poetry, playing basketball or tending to our gardens. We'd like to love who we want, look like we do and believe what we believe. If that is impossible and we are attacked while standing there, with our strollers- -our only option is to fight back. We started to confront them together. It was actually thanks to Antifascist Action. They stood in between us and the 30 Nazis and were the first to sustain any injuries. That's also when the stabbing took place. But thanks to their efforts, we kept together and didn't scatter. The immediate shock had spread a lot of panic. They could just as well have plowed through us if it wasn't for AFA. I'm not an advocate for AFA. I don't believe in violence. But the demonstration could continue thanks to them. We started a counterattack. And that's when the police got involved I tried to locate the person I had seen carrying a knife. Despite the chaotic situation, I really wanted to get to that guy. So I pulled my knife and went... into the rabble. I lost him but spotted, in passing, another person with a knife. And I thought: "I can't control this person. It's better if I take him out first." "We need to push them back." "If they stab one of us, they'll move forward and panic will spread." "They'll be able to take us down, moving on to the unprotected demonstration behind." So I took the opportunity and stabbed him. -Just anywhere? -Yes. I felt like I had no choice. Six people at 5.15? I was a teenager in the 90's, when Neo-Nazism emerged. My family came to Sweden on a boat. And I've always been told... ...that we don't have a country. And that those who disagree aren't good people. You need to challenge those ideas. We didn't have a lot of choice when we were kids: The Nazis were in the streets, beating up our friends. We had to do something. They'll march past Stureplan, all the way to the Royal Castle. That's their intended route. They are really putting effort into this: web pages and videos, urging people to come. What's their slogan? "Stop the immigrant invasion." -That's their slogan? -Yeah. They were 350 strong in Borlänge. It's easier to get people to come to Stockholm. But it is not the same mobilization. Since Borlänge was such a success for them, more will show up now. There'll be more than 150. 300, at least. We want "Möllan" to remain the way it is: an open and inclusive neighborhood. You don't have to be a "professional" activist, or an expert in Marxism to be able to say: I don't want any fascists or homophobes in my city. When your community is under attack from fascists or racists- -there are times when you have to physically stand your ground. "Stop, you may not pass here. You cannot march through Salem, spreading your hate speech." There's the question of whether it's right to physically stop another person from marching. And in the movement, we feel that history has taught us enough- -to give us the right to say stop. You have to build lets say three pillars of antifascist action but you must build all three if you do only two of them you are likely to fail you must do all three things the first thing is to deconstuct the slogans of the fascists because the fascist actually they don't have an ideology they have slogans they take ideas from left and right for example that the problems are caused by the immigrants and not by the bankers something like that you must deconstruct this that the life of the common people here will be better if we throw the immigrants away deconstruct the slogans of the fascists deconstruct the slogans of the fascists We're anti-fascists because we take the word freedom literally. Fascism is a denial of freedom and we believe in freedom. That's why we're in the exact opposite of fascism. Violence is a crucial pillar of National Socialist ideology. Take the myth of the "strongman," owning the streets and capable of cleaning them up. If you prove to those people that the power of National Socialism is only a myth... You dispel, you... You cut the National Socialist organization in half! Direct action also means thinking on your own: Asking what is best for the movement. Understanding that you have power. It's a plead to the grassroots for organization. With direct action, you can create grassroots organizations without any strict bureaucracy. The slogan would be: "Participate now, don't wait for the elections." We're in the area of Exarcheia. It's an important area for the anti-fascist and feminist movement. It's a safe zone for people under attack, like immigrants. There's a lot of solidarity here. They feel safe here. In 2013, a series of incidents indicated a peak in Golden Dawn's activities. They felt strong, like nothing was holding back their activities. This led to the well-known incident of the murder of Pavlos Fyssas. It was on September 18, 2013. He was murdered by a Golden Dawn battalion. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Memories of history arise after citizens have spread terror and panic. Greece wakes up to the political murder of 34-year-old Pavlos Fyssas. The victim was a famous musician, known for his anti-fascist views. The offender has admitted the murder and his collaboration with Golden Dawn... The murder of Pavlos Fyssas triggered a police investigation- -into the activities of Golden Dawn. Members of the ultra right-wing party were arrested- -including its leaders and parliamentary deputies. The trial starts this year. R.I.P. Killah P (Pavlos Fyssas) The murder of Pavlos Fyssas sent a clear signal to people in Greece. The need for anti-fascism was made evident. It also explains the radicalization that occurred here- -and why these methods are necessary to counter the Nazi violence. Sweden shouldn't have to be brought to that understanding quite so brutally- -to make people see that anti-fascism isn't radical, that it's normal. No wonder, a large percentage of the police force vote for Golden Dawn. In electoral centers where the police voted- -50 % supported Golden Dawn. That's a great percentage. Society won't protect us if we strike back in defence of our lives. We're on our own. Significant parts of the police force sympathize with the extreme right. On Saturday, December 6, 2008, a group of young boys, aged 16- -were drinking beer in Exarcheia, on the famous Mesologiou street. In those days, cops didn't really come to Exarcheia. But a police car passed by, close. The young guys walked up, throwing plastic bottles of water at the police car. The cops went away and left their car. Then they returned to the scene of the incident, firing a couple of rounds in the air. When people didn't leave, they shot and killed Alexis Grigoropoulos. The shooting of a 16-year-old boy by a 40-year-old cop - that's murder. A state murder. Many people, including me, at first didn't anticipate- -the level of hatred against the Greek police. Justified hatred. And the militants were especially caught by surprise when they realized- -that they are not alone in thinking of social inequality and injustice- -in the present world. Bring the funnel! Put the cloth deep inside. The cloth is then tightened up with tape. It's finished and can be used as a simple weapon. I don't think that all police officers are fascists. But one in three is a fascist. We don't attack the police because they, as individuals, are bad people. They might be sadists. Many of them are. But that's not why we attack them. We attack them because they are the legal representatives of an oppressive state. They are the legal representatives of an unfree society. And they are the realization that you are not free. Cops, pigs, murderers! I have always taken a clear stand against the extreme left. For me as a serious journalist and an expert it's a dead end- -that I need to distance myself from. From a strategic point of view, I think it's stupid of them to go straight to violence. Because this is the last strategy to use against the extreme right. Sure. We are in Exarcheia, it's a bit like Möllevångstorget. It's in the middle of the city. I'll send you directions. It's the place to be. The anti-fascist work comes with its problems. It's problematic for those who experience the work and get into it. It's tough, strenuous and can be radical. Not necessarily in a bad way, but it can get aggressive or physical. We're just people, who'd rather spend our time doing nicer stuff. Things like art, music or writing. People want an outlet for their creativity. People aren't exactly aching to get out to Salem when it's -10 C outside- -standing arm-in-arm to stop a Nazi march. So that year, the cops had blocked the way and we couldn't get to our demonstration. There they were, fully armed- -batons in hand, trying to force people back onto the trains. They started hitting people. But people persisted, determined to get to the demonstration. That year, my illusions about how society works fell apart. It was so clear. We were there to stop the Nazis. Nobody likes them. As we gathered in the tunnel, we saw the police advancing with batons. They tried to force people out of the tunnel with some kind of shock tactic. That was a pretty strange experience. I was brought up under the impression that the police is a force for good. Like most children, I was told that the police are there to help. When you see that level of violence from someone supposed to represent safety- -something happens inside you. You can't believe that it is for real. -They're not there to protect us. -Exactly. What did they do? They hit us without consideration. They didn't care who got hurt. They pushed forward and didn't care who fell or got hurt. They really didn't care. I stood pretty far up front- -with the people wearing helmets. And I remember that when the rows in front of me got hit by the police- -they started to back up, pushing me further and further into the front. In slow motion, like in a movie, I saw a cop raising his baton, swinging at me. I remember thinking: "This is going to hurt." But all I heard was the baton bouncing, since I had a helmet on. The numbers of the nazis decreased every year. At their most they were around 2,000, but by the end they were just a few hundreds. Which showed that it is tough to be a Nazi, and it should be tough to be a Nazi. The Nazi movement doesn't grow if they are challenged. That's an immediate result. The march didn't stop happening just because they grew tired of it. They grew tired because every time they tried, people stood up to them. They were constantly confronted and couldn't gain political ground. We got them all the way back here. Unfortunately, there are a lot of rocks here. Rocks were thrown from both sides. Here, the police were able to stop us again, pushing us up by the fence. They could separate us quite effectively there. And the Nazis went from being very scary to being incredibly scared. They had blood running from their noses and ears, their faces struck with fear. An angry crowd of people charged after them. The Nazis aren't even from this area, so they were kind of lost. We know our way around here. Until then, the police had protected the Nazis. But that changed when one of the officers got hit by a stone thrown by a Nazi. The police officer turned around and started to charge the Nazi. A loud cheer came from all of us. Finally, they focused on the attackers. It's a strange feeling, getting excited when someone is hit. Damn strange. The police had called in advance, saying Nazis were going to show up. I got the call that same day, in the morning, around nine, ten: "The police say the Nazis are going to show up." By then, it was too late to start mobilizing people. So the police told the organizers that Nazis might attack the protest? Why didn't the police do anything about it themselves? According to the police, there was a problem in their internal communication. On site were only six officers, obviously not nearly enough. They knew about the Nazi gathering at least 3-4 hours prior. I knew about it then. In Kärrtorp, we had given a permit for a demonstration on the square. Unfortunately, the police force on site was not sizable enough. Also, we actually had information pointing to that something could occur. But somehow, somewhere, something happened and the information got lost. We did receive information, but due to unfortunate circumstances- -it got lost on the way and didn't reach people like it should have. I must say that the stabbing, even though a cop didn't hold the knife- -could have been prevented by the police. People could have died here, although no-one did- -due to the subpar work of the police. It's of course terrible if the police are unable to defend demonstrators. It's a fact that the police always underestimate the extreme right. They're never prepared and always surprised- -when Nazis act violently or attack protesters. It's incomprehensible. They even have special educational programs in place. But they always misunderstand the situation. So my trust in the Swedish police is quite poor. The second pillar is that is that you don't allow them to terrorize the streets because they don't gather strength by their arguments they gather strength by terrorizing people this we should not allow we should form a massmovement an anti-fascist mass movement that does not allow them to do this that counters them on the streets -They didn't do anything at the time? -No. They were busy and lacked the personnel required to be able to arrest anyone. All they did was macing us, trying to keep us away from the Nazis. -Do you regret your actions? -No. Under the same circumstances, I'd do the same thing again. I'm not saying violence is always right, but sometimes...there's no other option. Had we ran away, those left behind would have been vulnerable. Violence is not a very good instrument, but sometimes a useful instrument. Attacking fascists should and could provide the means to create- -a space depopulated of fascists. We need a public space depopulated of fascism. I'm in favor of direct democracy. In the economy and in the politics. I think that present societies are class societies. They are not equal egalitarian societies. I oppose thee state and the capitalists. I'm in favor of the working councils. Therefore, I am an anti-fascist. You have to get organized. It's the key to everything. You have to do it yourself, not just expect politicians to do things. If there are many fascists in a part of town, you do something about it. Don't wait for anyone else to do it. Organization is everything. Our task is to clear the space for other organizations. Making their work possible, clearing a space for class struggle. One of the many tactics we use is confronting the Nazis physically. That makes it tough to be a Nazi. And it works. They get it. I don't understand the thinking behind it. It's an extremely short-sighted strategy: "We'll beat them up right now." I don't really have any understanding or trust for this movement. Interestingly, militant anti-fascism in Sweden- -is almost exclusively a reaction to the extreme right. Many say that you should counter them with arguments, not to engage in violence: "Don't defend your demonstrations." But what do you do when they start to spread? What do you do when they stab people and the police doesn't do anything? What do you do? Those questions need to be answered. Anti-fascism in Sweden has become stuck. We should find new ways. Somewhere between 2005 and 2010, we got stuck. We saw that violence was effective and got stuck in that pattern. Having cleared the streets from fascists, we were set in that thinking. They moved to other arenas, but we were stuck in our ways. Violent tactics have a place but don't apply to everything. We should have developed new methods, but we didn't. We fell behind. They lead the way, and we're chasing after them. I don't think anti-fascism is synonymous to violence. We do a lot of non-violent work, but violence is attention-grabbing. Anti-fascism is important, but so are many other fields of work. Anti-fascism in itself isn't enough. You have to do other stuff, too. Anti-fascism is an integral part of the class struggle. Class politics based on people from just one nation is fascism. It's about breaking out of our own isolation- -if we're mainly in a Swedish or white context. It's about building something together. Lets prepare for a long day! Keep track of each other, take care of each other- -take initiatives, stay active and keep moving. I don't know what to say. I feel sick. I think there are around 700 Nazis. They openly state that they are Nazis- -and they're allowed to march through the city in uniforms... I don't know what else to say. A lot of people who I love wouldn't be welcome in their society. It just feels hard to talk about this right now. Luckily, the Nazi presence isn't strong in Malmö- -aside from a small amount of stickers and such. But on the eve of March 8, 2014, it reached a peak. On March 8, International Women's Day- -my friends in Malmö were stabbed, by Nazis from the Party of Swedes. Many of them were seriously injured. One was taken under ventilator care and is fighting to regain normality. Sorry, I have to make a phone call. A bunch of idiots are holding a protest against panhandling. Hey. I just wanted to check if you guys knew that there is a protest- -against panhandling, at the municipal building. -I had no idea. -I thought you knew. Jonte is there. I don't think they'll need anyone, but you can give him a call to make sure. So Jonte is there. Where is it again? City hall. Sorry, I meant City hall. -Great, thanks, I had no idea. -Call them and see if they need any help. -OK, will do! -Great, take care! This is the roundabout where the "Fight Malmö" mural use to be. Traces of a pride flag remain in the background. The Moriska pavilion is right here. The assault took place in the intersection over there. Afterwards, I walked down Kristianstadsgatan- -and to Friisgatan, where I lived at the time. After the assault, I walked half a kilometer, down to my apartment. I laid down on the bathroom floor and called for an ambulance. They picked me up about 40 minutes after the assault. We were assaulted and almost killed in our own streets, but survived. Amazingly, not only did we get back up- -but the struggle continued in Malmö. "Fight Malmo" came to mean that anti-fascism means self-defense. Authorities and politicians claim- -that it is terrorism or extremism to stand up against Nazis. But that's not the case. If not us, who? If not now, when? We need urban organizing and local, regional struggles. When we work together on a local level we build trust in the community. We can't tell the rest of the country what to do. But when we come out and work locally, we build a different kind of strength: The support of the city, the neighborhood. I hope more people take up that work. We see how that works here in Athens. Some run universities, others trade unions. Let's start there, co-operating when necessary. And if not, we'll be working locally the rest of the time. I do hope people continue working that way. And of course the third level the third pillar you don't allow fascists to have presence in the institutions and organsations of the civil society you don't allow them to come into the trade unions in the cultural clubs in the musical milieu in to the football matches this is very very important because if you allow them to to appear there you legitimize them you don't discuss with them you say you are an enemy and I don't accept your existence you are an enemy and I don't accept your existence Salem isn't the only place where we've been able organize- -and made them quit, by way of attrition and persistent pressure. They've been ran out of schools, time and again. The same thing happens in Stockholm, when they try to establish themselves. People quickly organize to do something about it. Like in Kärrtorp, where they tried to establish a street presence. They're pushed back. People don't want them there. And that happens not by ignoring them, but by taking action. Say you're on the bus and someone says something racist. For me, it's natural to stand up to that. It's the least I can do. We're here! When ex-Nazis get in touch, saying they've called it quits- -and that they no longer want to be a part of it, we leave them be. We don't have anything against them as individuals. When people come under pressure, when it's not cool to be a Nazi anymore... Some, who aren't as ideologically committed, start questioning the ideology. The Nazi groups might be ideologically strong- -but the individuals aren't always totally convinced. So when the going gets tough their commitment starts to shatter. Those who quit a group but remain racists, albeit unorganized - we let them be, too. It's not our place to dictate what people think. Our task is rather to cripple their organizations. So what happened to fascists at a street level in Sweden? In the '90s, fascists were everywhere. People were afraid to leave their homes, with gangs of skinheads assaulting people. There were murders, a sniper killing immigrants, attacks, and so on. Did that disappear by itself? No. Young people fought the fascists in the streets. That has neither been recognized nor understood by society at large. Generally, it's about acting in time. Once these parties start gaining ground, it's hard to stop them. Forget about waiting for them to become democrats by themselves. They take hold and grow. I think there's a broad, popular opposition to the Nazi movement. But it comes down to one's belief in the future. What if we could believe in real democracy? That we could decide together over all the parts of society. The economy, the future and what was going to get built. And how the whole society was going to be organized. If people really believed that was possible...! We're walking to court. We're four plaintiffs, going to trial- -against four Nazis who on March 8, 2014 tried to murder five of us. The preliminary investigation was sad and amateurish. It wasn't properly prioritized. One perpetrator was released, giving him the possibility to flee the country. Two years later, we'll hopefully achieve some justice. In practice, it's meaningless - it doesn't affect the movement. The struggle in the streets continues, no matter the outcome. Our reality...is still the same. Are you active still? Of course. We can't back off now. It's all about keeping the fight going. We need to support each other in the struggle for justice and freedom. We'll never give up. Today is a proof of that. Many refuse to back down. We will continue gaining ground, like the working class should all over the country. Is this the right way? Showan! -They were all out of tobacco. -Thanks. It's okay. Subtitles: Svante Persson
