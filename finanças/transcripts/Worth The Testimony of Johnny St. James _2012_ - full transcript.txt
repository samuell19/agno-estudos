(church bell tolls) (birds chirp) (gentle piano music) - So do you want me to go in there with you? - No. No, I told you I'd do this. - All right. So, I had this dream last night. Crazy stuff. You remember Mo? - Yes. - The first bartender at Whiskey Pete's, back before we was working together? - I just said yes. - Well, she was running a Taco Hut. - A Taco Hut? - Yeah, man. Well, you know, she was managing it and me and you, we was working it. - Working it? - Me and you. It was crazy busy and we ran out of ground beef of all things. - I don't think Taco Hut even uses ground beef. - It's tacos, tacos have beef. - No, I think their ground beef is made out of like soybeans or something. - Nobody makes tacos with soybeans. - They do, they do. But they just don't want anyone to know it because then no one would want it. - Whatever, not the point, dude. The point is we ran out of this ground beef-like substance. Everyone's panicking, they're flipping out. Nobody knew what to do and you say, calm down, don't freak out. Then, you go to the grocery store and you come back with all this ground beef, and a grill and Mo starts to grill it. - Grilling at the restaurant? - I didn't say it made sense in the dream. I just said I dreamed it, but anyway. It just keeps getting busier and busier and I'm getting all super anxious, right? - Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Hickey] Everyone's flipping out, the customers, employees, reaching a fever pitch. (distorted speech) - Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I get it Hickey, Hickey, what's the point? - The point? The point is you got the beef. - That's great. And here I was fearing that there was no real point. - Ah, have faith, partner. - We're all out, man. - What I meant was, even when things were at their worst, you kept calm, you kept grounded, you kept us from flying off the rails. (phone rings) Yeah? Where's it at? Hey, man, you got a pen? - Yeah, glove box. - Hold on. You got something to, here, I got this. Hold on. Okay, yeah, go. Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. Hold on. (pen scratches) Is that 5193? 5193, okay, we can be there in two hours. Mm-hm. So, you still have this. (church bell tolls) (slow dramatic music) - I didn't even know that was in there. - Maybe. - No. Have it, it's yours. - Why'd you keep it? - I didn't. Throw it away. - What for? - Because it's worthless. That's what's for. - Hey! Was that really necessary? It's time, man. - Yeah, yeah. Long time coming. - All right, are you sure you don't want me to come in there with you? - No, no, I'm gonna do this alone. - I'll be right here if you need me. - All right. Don't worry, I got this. (dog barks) (birds chirps) (engaging dramatic music) Hello? Hello? (engaging dramatic music) - [Earl] You must be the new guy? - Not exactly what I expected. - Would that be me or the place? - Either one. - This church has been here for 88 years. It's as beautiful as the day it was made. As for me, only God can take credit for that. - So how's this gonna go down? - Well, the hardest part was walking through that door, so just make yourself at home. - How many others are there? - I like to keep the group small. You know, more personal, intimate. - How long you been doing these meetings? - Wow, you ask a lot of questions. Are you a cop or something? - Yeah, you're under arrest. (both laugh) - You've got a sense of humor. That's a good thing to have around here. Look, I got to go grab some stuff before the others show up, so I'll be right back. - Need a hand? - No, no, I'm fine. It's good to see you here. I'm really glad you came. - Long time coming. - Yeah. (slow dramatic music) - Are you the first one here? - Look a little nervous there, guy. - You startled me, that's all. - You startle easy. - Yeah. Who are you? - I'm no one. - No, he's Isaac and I'm Natalie-- - Hey! - What? - Oh, you got a good one. - [Isaac] What was that? - I said you got a good girl there. - [Isaac] Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I can tell, I got an eye for these things. - Why don't you keep your eye on your own business. - I meant no disrespect. - None taken. - All right, okay, tough guys, relax, leave him alone. Hey, are you with me? - Yeah, of course, baby. - All right, good, 'cause I need you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You know him? - Oh, no, no. - You sure about that? - Yes, I'm sure. - You don't sound very sure. - Look at you all jealous, cute and all. - No, it's just you know how I get in places I'm not comfortable. I just get-- - Jealous? - You know how I get. I'm still just... This place, I just still don't know. - Listen, I know but I'm nervous enough without your baggage, okay, so. - Natalie. - Hey, Earl. - Hi. - [Isaac] I'm Isaac. - It's nice to meet you. - All right, well, we're gonna sit. - Sure. We're gonna start soon. - [Johnny] Not a very punctual group, huh? - Can I ask you something? - Where does that lead? - You checking your exit? - Where? - Down. It's a basement for storage. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hi, I brought coffee. - Hey, everyone. There's not enough for everybody. So unfortunately, you're gonna have to share. Half a cup for each of you. - Great, just in time. Thank you. - 'Cause everyone knows that Chad loves to share. - I'm just gonna give it a few more minutes and then we'll start. (upbeat country music) (phone rings) * On that crazy track - Yeah, boss? Yeah, I told ya, he's got that dentist thing. He should be out anytime now. Yeah, after that, we'll be there. Yeah. (phone beeps) * I've been round this country * Looking for my (muffled lyrics) * Now sometimes I find her * But danged if I can't beat her * (muffled lyrics) - Every time. - Perfect. (slow dramatic music) - Crazy day. I said crazy day. - Yeah, I suppose. - It's crazy out there. Crazy people, crazy things. I was walking here; I like to walk; and this old guy was about a block back. He was screaming. Now, I just suppose he was crazy and yelling at himself, so I keep walking and I get about another block down, take a left and a few seconds later, I hear him yelling again. This time, he's right across the street from me and he's yelling and he's shaking his fists at me. At this point, it's pretty obvious he's talking to me. We're the only two people on the street. I get about another block down, take a left, and as soon as the street curves, I start running, running so fast. I mean, picture me running in these high heels. So, anyway, I duck into a coffee shop and I grab a latte. I was gonna grab one anyway and a few minutes later, there he is, walking by. He's looking through the window. He doesn't see me, but I see him, so I waited for about 15 minutes so I wouldn't run into him and that's why I'm late. I'm just happy to be in here with some not so psycho people. Oh, wow, really? I forgot my latte. - (scoffs) Awful! - So what's your story? - Hmm? - What's your story? Why are you here? - Free coffee. - Could've just said you had a girlfriend, jerk. - You sure you wanna do this? - Mm-hmm, I'm fine. - Okay. - Okay. - Sweet. (church bell tolls) - Okay, we all know why we're here. The only thing left to do, as my ex-wife once said, is to get to it. We're all here for the same purpose. We're all here to help each other to achieve that purpose. Now, for the sake of the newcomers in the room, there's no judgment here. This is a place for healing and forgiveness. All right, so why don't we pray. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen. This is a first meeting for some, so, Cherice, would you mind going over the steps and telling us what they mean to you? - Really? - Why not? - Okay, yeah, sure. We've admitted that we are powerless against alcohol and that our lives have become unmanageable. I think that one's pretty obvious. Step two, we must believe that there's a power greater than ourselves that can restore us to sanity. For me, it's God. I have to believe that he's with me in this battle. We must make the decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God. - You're using the word we a lot. Why don't you tell us what these words mean to you. - Right, sorry, me. I must make a searching and fearless moral inventory of myself. This is hard. Me, I must admit to God and to myself and to others the exact nature of my wrongs. With God, it was easy. But it's hard for me to come to these meetings and talk about my mistakes. I must make a list of all the people that I've harmed and I must be willing to make amends with them. I suppose my list is longer than most, but shorter than some. (hands tap) When I have a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, I will try to carry this message to others and I will practice these principles in all of my affairs. - Somebody's been studying their book. That was pretty much verbatim. - So? - Nothing. I was just saying. - All right, ladies, come on. Remember, there's no judgment here, okay? We're just here to listen. Good. My name is Earl and I'm an alcoholic. - [Group] Hi, Earl. - I've been sober now for 10 years. 10 years ago, I made a terrible choice, a choice that changed the course of my life and the lives of others. And like every other addict eventually does, I self-destructed, and just like many other addicts, my downward spiral didn't just affect me. (engaging dramatic music) We cannot change the mistakes of our lives. We can't correct them. But if we allow God into our lives, we can experience the forgiveness that we need and move on. That same desire that drives us to drink and abuse drugs is the exact desire for wholeness. And that desire can be filled through a relationship with God. That's what I'm doing here. I'm hoping that by sharing my story and by listening to all of yours, I can continue on the path that I've started. You see, had I not hit rock bottom, I never would've found the courage to look up and ask God for help, ask God for his hand and his forgiveness. And you know something? He did forgive me and then he sent me on the right way. I mean, there I was rotting away for three long years in a jail cell. Turns out, my new cellmate's name was Warden. No, obviously, the irony of that name didn't escape me. Warden, he was serving his 30th year of a three life-term sentence. He said that when he was on the outside, he owned a business, all right? And he shared it with his teenage son. Now, the plan was that his son, when he turned 18, he was gonna take over the business with him, 50/50. And then as he got older, he would take over the business entirely. Well, his kid had other plans. Turns out, his son fell in love with the joys of the theater and he wanted to become an actor, so he packed up his bags. He moved cross country to pursue his life's dream living in La La Land. Well, I told Warden, I said, well, that's too bad, right? He just looked at me and he simply said, maybe. Okay, maybe. Then he tells me that he couldn't handle the business himself, right? So he had to hire a partner to work with him. Well, it turns out that this partner happened to be a conman. He took him for everything he had before he skipped town along with Warden's wife. So, obviously, I put this together. I said, well, so what happened? Did you kill him? Is that why you're here? And he says to me, yes and I just thought this is terrible. I said that to him. He just looked at me again and he said, maybe. I mean, at this point, I had it with the maybes, all right? I even got upset with him. I said, what are you talking about? What do you mean maybe? There are no maybes about this. This is a horrible series of events in your life! And he says to me, look, my son went to Los Angeles struggling to be an actor for 10 long years. Audition after audition, it never worked for him. His career didn't take off. He worked as a waiter working himself through night school. At night school, he earned a diploma in computer science. He met a beautiful woman, he fell in love, and then he started his own computer company. He never told me what the name was, but he said I would definitely recognize it. Years go by, his son has kids of his own. His kids grow up, a few of those have kids of their own. Now, what Warden was trying to say to me, this is what he said, he said, every rotten thing that ever happened to me bore good fruit. All right. Now, I said to him, Warden, that doesn't make sense. I mean, that's all well and good for your son, but look at you. Look at your life. You're rotting away in here. You're watching your whole life disappear before your very eyes. And he says, no, no! I was rotting away out there. In here, I discovered my faith. I was never really free until I came in here. He was never really free until he came to prison. And, then, it hit me. bam, like that, neither was I. But I sure as hell wanted to be. Then, all of a sudden, everything that I'd been hearing, everything that was being shovel at me in those mandatory AA meetings started to make sense to me. And it wasn't very long before I was on my knees looking up and begging God to help me as well. Well, that's my story. That's what's brought me here to all you fine folks. (group applauds) All right, who wants to share next? - Yeah, yeah, we're on our way shortly. Well, I don't know what to tell you, boss. Maybe he's got a lot of cavities. No, no, no, I did not mean any disrespect. Can you send Freddie and Marvin? Maybe. - God's will, God's will. Everybody always wants to implement God's will. What is God's will? - What do you mean? - I mean, at the end of the day, whether you have you have the nice house and the car and, you know, your own corporation, kids, all the fancy stuff, it looks good from the outside perspective, but does that means it's really God's will? - I won Miss Littleton when I was 17. Great, right? (church bell tolls) Well, it turns out not so much. It was doing my duties supporting the win that I discovered whiskey, pills, and coke. And here I am. - That's right, here you are. Everything that happened to you has led you to this time and place. Maybe this is exactly where you need to be. (country music plays) It's a matter of putting your faith, your trust in a higher power. Trusting that God has a purpose for you and those around you. Now, if you wanna narrow that down to a practical perspective, that's fine. Be my guest. All I'm saying is that if you choose to look at things positively, you will start to see positive results. The choice is yours. Do you choose to live in a world of chaos or a world that is benevolent and full of meaning? For me, I choose faith. - So it's that simple then? - No, it isn't that simple actually. - I wasn't talking to you. - My name is Chad, I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Chad. - I've been sober for three years now. You know, for me, I love alcohol. It's what I do best, drinking. It's my second nature, like breathing for most people. And I drank so much, at a certain point three years ago, I walked into my doctor and my doctor told me, basically, you're about to lose the one and only liver that you have. So, like any good alcoholic with this new information, I found my way to the closest bar and I ordered my favorite drink. And right as that drink was about to touch my lips, I saw this man. He said a few words to me that changed my life. I put that drink down. I've been here ever since. He's a good man. I thank him. - What a life? Saved your life, huh? What a life, what a life. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nah, nothing, nothing. You know what? Let's hear more about the almighty Earl. - What's your problem? - My problem is that you guys are all sitting around putting your faith in this man and his God. - Hey, Earl, where'd you find this guy? - You know you're not supposed to be here drunk? - Babe! - I'm just talking about the truth. Isn't that what we're here for, the truth? Didn't you read the sign on the door? - Okay, Johnny, this is not how we do things here. - You know, you probably aren't gonna like the truth, but I'll tell it to you. You wanna hear the truth? - Go ahead. - You wanna hear the truth? - Yeah. - I'm gonna give you the truth. May I approach the bench, your honor? Thank you. Okay, the truth is that I've been sober for three years. I don't like it. I don't enjoy it. You think I enjoy coming to these rooms, listening to these steps, working a program, having a sponsor, all this crap? No, I don't enjoy it, okay? What I enjoyed was I enjoyed being drunk. I like drinking. I love alcohol and I loved drugs. I liked being the guy that was stupid and irresponsible. That was what I liked. I enjoyed causing a scene, being a mess, but those days are over for me, okay? I can't do that anymore. I had to grow up. And so, I'm just here to tell you that it's not a joke, man. Okay, we're not here because we're having a good time. You think I enjoy this? You think I wanna do this? No, I wanna be that guy! I wanna be the life of the party! To live in a fantasy world, to be reckless and careless and not do anything for anybody except for myself. Being selfish, that's what it's about, man! That's fun! I don't wanna be sitting in some stupid AA meeting. You think I wanna be this reliable, steady guy that shows up everywhere he's suppose to, that keeps commitments? This isn't fun. I don't go out. I don't have a social life. I don't do anything. I sit alone, home, and bored. That's what I do. My life sucks. But at the end of the day, man, I'm here because I got to save my life, all right? This is life and death. It's serious business. So maybe you can grow up and try and figure that out because this is as good as it's ever gonna get, so appreciate it and now you got the truth. - Sit down, Chad! - Leave him alone, Violeta. - Oh! Oh, you're a little defensive. Is that your squeeze up there? Is that your fella? Huh? - Johnny? - [Johnny] No? - A little respect, please? - You guys aren't having your own little (lips smacking) meetings on the side? - No. - You wanna back off, man? - [Isaac] What is your deal? - I wanna know what's your deal? What's your deal? How come you're not sharing with the group? What, are you hiding something? Huh, are you hiding something, darling? - Dude, leave her alone! How long are you gonna let this go on for? - You aren't exactly making it comfortable for everyone. - What, what do you mean? What am I doing? I'm just telling the truth here. Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing? I'm just telling the truth. What? What's going on, hun? What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of? - Okay, Johnny! Look, I know it can be overwhelming your first time. - Oh, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, I know the first time can be overwhelming. - [Earl] That's enough. - Is it? Is that enough? Because you know what? I feel like I'm just getting warmed up. - All right, man, that's it! - Chad! Whoa! Whoa! (men grunt and gun thuds) - Why did you do that? - Is he dead? I'm out of here. - No, shut up and sit down. No one's going anywhere. Hey, don't you move! All right. All right, you up, grab him. Up, grab him. - Is it me or do crazy people follow me everywhere? (hands tap nervously) (Hickey heavily sighs and moans) - [Isaac] He's unconscious. I don't think he's going anywhere. - [Johnny] All right, back to your seats. - Sit down, Earl. Sit down, Earl. Sit down, Earl! All right. Okay. (church bell tolls) Okay. - I can't take this anymore. - Sit down! Sit down! Sit down! - Fine! - Johnny! Whoa, wait a minute, pal! - [Johnny] Back outta hear, Hickey. - What's going on here, partner? - Just back out! - What are you doing? - You don't wanna get wrapped up in this. - Wrapped up in what? I thought I was bringing you here to get better. - Just go, Hick! - Come on, man. You know I can't do that. - Yes, you can. And take me with you. - [Both] Shut up and sit down! - Johnny? - You know who that is? That guy? If you knew who that was, then you would know that I'm not done here. - Johnny, put the gun down. - Not gonna happen. Just back out. - I know what you're going through. - (scoffs) You don't, you don't know anything. Don't move! - Listen to him. Don't move, I'm gonna get you outta here. Johnny, you can't do this, pal. - None of that, come on. Come on! - [Hickey] Johnny! - You know you're not that fast. Keep your hands up. - I can't be here. - Sit, just sit! Sit down! Now, no, no, don't! Don't, don't! - I just wanted to come to this meeting-- - Don't, sit down, don't! Okay, this conversation is over. All right, just go. Just back out, okay? I don't wanna hurt anyone else. - I know that you're hurt, Johnny. I'm your partner, talk to me. - Just leave! Leave, Hickey! Just back out, okay? I'm doing what I came here to do. I never judged you. - What? - When you came from your little vacation. - I paid my debt. - When you came back. - [Hickey] I became a cop! - Right! You weren't always a cop! - No, I wasn't. - [Johnny] And I never judged you. - I know. You had faith in me even when I didn't deserve it. You believed in me and that's why I believed in myself. That's why I became a cop. But I'm not the same man I used to be, brother. - Well, neither am I. Do not interrupt me again, brother. - [Hickey] What are you gonna do? - I am gonna do what I came here to do. I told you that already. You had your chance to leave! Just back out, Hickey! Back out! - Johnny. You're not gonna shoot me. - Yeah? (gun clicks) - Okay, Johnny, we can work this out. I'm on your side. Tell me what you need. Tell me what you wanna see happen. I'll give it to you. - (laughs) Oh, no. Wait, no, no, don't tell me. You're gonna play negotiator with me right now? - Johnny, I'm your friend. I wanna help you. Now, tell me what you need. I'll deliver. - What I need is right here. Just go. - [Hickey] Johnny. - Just go, Hickey, go. - Okay, Johnny. - OKay. Okay, who wants to share? - Hey, boss, we got a situation here, yeah. (Chad moans and struggles) - We should share. Who wants to share? Come on, it's an AA meeting, right? Share, we should work the steps. It works if you work it, right? Works if you work it. No one, no one wants to... Okay, I'll just-- - No, step one, we've admitted we're powerless against alcohol and that our lives have become unmanageable. - That's very good. Very good. Our lives have become, our lives have become unmanageable. Okay, step two? Step two? No one? It's like pulling teeth. All right, if I have to do this every time. Step two! - We believe that a greater power than ourselves can restore us to sanity. - [Johnny] Say it again! - We believe that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity. - [Johnny] I can't hear you, say it again! - We believe that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity! - Sanity? Sanity? A power greater than ourselves. Well, today, that would be me. - I think he missed the sanity part. - Shh. - Who'd of thunk it? A greater power. Tell you what. Here's how it's gonna go. I'm gonna share. I'm gonna go ahead and share and then someone else can share later. - And what if we have nothing to say? - [Johnny] What? - What if we have nothing to say? - Oh, everyone's got something to say, sweetheart. Everyone's got something to say. Everyone's got skeletons locked deep in their closet. Don't they, Earl? My name is Johnny St. James and I'm an alcoholic. Oh, come on, people! I'm Johnny, I'm an alcoholic. - [Group] Hi, Johnny. - Thank you. Play by the rules here. Let's see. I drank this morning, so I guess I got zero days. I got zero days sober. But that might change, who knows. Anything can happen. Up until 10 years ago, I was never much of a drinker. You know, I'd have wine with dinner and champagne at a wedding, that kinda thing. But no, I take that back because I like beer. I really like beer. I used to brew my own beer. It was fun. But I was more into the chemistry of it. You know, the science. My wife used to say that I was crazy and that's why she loved me. (gentle music) She loved me. Ah, but then, 10 years ago, well, that all changed. So I started drinking heavy, you know? Hard stuff every day, all day. Yeah, I was really going for it, but I was able to maintain, you know? I was able to really get up every day and do what I had to do. I even started a new career. I started a noble career as a cop. - So you really are a cop? - Yeah. But I don't think you're supposed to be asking questions. You're not supposed to ask questions, right? I thought, you know what? (foot stomps) That's fine, it's fine. We're kind of off book here anyway. Ah, man, now I lost my train of thought. Someone else has to go. You wanna share, honey? Who wants to share? Someone else has to share now. It's someone else's turn. Okay, I think I'd like to hear from leather jacket over here. - I'll share-- - Shut up! What's your name? - [Isaac] No-- - Shut up. - I've got something. - Shut up! I wanna hear from leather jacket. - I have something I'd like to-- - Shut up! - [Natalie] Just stop. - What's your name. - My name is Isaac and I'm an alcoholic. - Oh, my, wow! You, you have got moxie, man. - [Isaac] I have got-- - Go ahead, do it again, start it from the top. What's your name, no, do the whole thing again. What, my name is, come on, do the thing. - My name is Isaac. - Hi, Isaac! Okay, go. - I guess I hit rock bottom a few months ago and I-- - You're gonna lead with rock bottom? I'm sorry, go on. - I've continued to work. I'm a graphic designer. I do freelance work. - I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry, go on. Go on. - I just got into web design. - Boring! - [Isaac] Excuse me? - Buddy, you are boring me to tears here, man. - [Isaac] What is it that you want? - Well, I want you to tell me the truth. - I'm sorry, I'm trying to tell you how I got here. - You're a graphic. - Graphic designer, yeah. And alcohol is something I go to. - When's the last time you had a drink? - I've been coming to meetings. - When's the last time you had a drink? - Six months ago. - That's the truth? How much do you weigh? - 175 pounds. - You weigh what? - Yeah. - What was your drink? Or what was your favorite? What was it? - [Isaac] Whiskey. - Whiskey? - Yeah. - What'd you like? You like bourbon, you like scotch, you like the Irish? What'd you like? - [Isaac] Bourbon. - Bourbon? Bourbon, the sweetest of the browns. - [Isaac] But I'm sober now. - Sober now. - [Isaac] Yes. - Okay. Feeling good? - [Isaac] Yes. - Life's better? - [Isaac] Yeah, I think so. - Yeah, and you're getting right with God, are you? - God? - Yeah. You believe in God? - Yeah, I guess. - You guess so? You guess? - I mean, yes. - He guesses so. - [Isaac] Yes. - You guess so? - [Isaac] Yes, I believe it. - Well, let me hear you say it. - I believe in God. - [Johnny] Say it again. - I believe in God. - [Johnny] You got to mean it! - [Isaac] I believe in God! - [Johnny] You got to mean it, man! - I believe in God! - I'm not buying it, man. - [Isaac] I believe in God. - No, you don't, man. I don't think you do at all. I don't think anything you've told me is true. - [Isaac] I'm telling you the truth. - Are you an alcoholic? - [Isaac] I am sober now. But, yes, I am an alcoholic. - You're not an alcoholic. - [Isaac] I am an alcoholic. - You're not an alcoholic. - You're leading him. That's not how this works. - Hey, hey, hey! New rules today! The rules are the guy with the gun makes the rules. You got a gun? No, shut up, cupcake! - What is it that you want? What do you want me to say? What do you wanna know? - I'm a cop, I can sniff this out. I know when you're lying to me, man! Just give me some truth. - About? - Give me some truth! - I'm telling you the truth! I'm telling -- - Johnny, that's enough, man! - Well, look who found his voice. - All right, look, we both know why you're here. So stop, just stop this. - No, no, no, no. It's not your turn. It's not your turn. Not yet. (sinister music) - Johnny, all right. All right, Johnny, okay! - It's not your turn, Earl. - [Earl] All right, Johnny-- - It's not your turn, Earl. - Okay, all right! Okay, all right! Sit down, stop! (phone rings) Yeah? - Hey, man, we can still spin this. I mean, nobody's dead yet, right? - Not yet. - This isn't you, Johnny. - Isn't it? - No, you're the good one, the grounded one. I'm the screw-up, not you. I mean, I wasn't good at nothing except breaking heads and taking names, so I became a cop. But, you, I mean, you were a man of God on your way to seminary. What happened to you was horrible and I know you think it changed you, but it didn't. You're still a good man. - Well, I know different, Hickey. - What made you wanna go to seminary? - I wanted to help people find the way. - And when you couldn't do that anymore, what happened? - (sighs) I became a cop. - To help people, right? - No, no, you know what? No, I see what you're doing. But, no, no, okay? - Well, then why'd you become a cop? - You know what, Hickey? This has become tiresome. (phone beeps) - I don't like this. (tense music) - Who's next? What about you? - I'm really worried about Chad. - Chad, are why you worried about Chad? - I'm worried about Chad. (sirens blaring) - Took 'em long enough. (police radio chatter) - [Violeta] Now would be a good time to let us leave. - Not quite yet. - [Officer] Let's go! (dramatic music) - All right, everyone remain calm. - [Natalie] What's going on? - Cops cut the power. Well, guess we should just get down to business. (gun clicks) - Johnny! (gun shot fires) - [Police officers] Go, go! You guys, follow me! Go, go, go! Open the door! Hold the perimeter! - Don't move. - [Officer] Stop, stop! Hold the perimeter. Nobody fire. - Don't you move. - I just wanna go. - Sit down. - Johnny. - Sit down. - Sit down or so help me, I will shoot you right now! I'm gonna get real dramatic here. - [Violeta] I just wanna leave. - I'm gonna count to three. One... Two-- - [Cherice] Violeta, sit down! Right now! Please. - I'm sorry. (phone rings) - Yeah. - Time's running out partner. How long do you think it will be before SWAT makes their move? - [Johnny] I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry, just come out. (sirens blare) (muffled radio chatter) - Oh, God help us. (intense suspenseful music) - Anybody else wanna coffee? - I could use one. (sirens blare) (harrowing piano music) Thank you. - Better taste it first. Right? It's pretty bad. I used to work in a coffee house. - [Natalie] Oh yeah? - That's where I met Gilly. - Is that your wife? - I was a barista and an assistant manager. It was kind of a crappy job. You don't make a lot of money and there's no benefits. But what was cool was there was entertainment every night. So you got to see comics, open mics, music. I was working a night shift in June, late afternoon, early evening, the sun was kinda coming down and I see this image in the door, a silhouette and she's walking toward me and I thought she was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. She gave me a little smile and then she kept on going by over to the stage. It turns out she was gonna play that night. She was in a jazz quartet. And I remember watching her play piano and I said that's it, I'm done. Game over, this is the girl for me. She was a really good piano player. (melancholic piano music) - I bet she was. - Oh, everything's gonna be okay. - Yeah. - You should probably go sit down. - All right. (phone rings) - Okay, where were we? (phone rings) (ominous music) - [Violeta] How does this end? - You ready to share? - [Violeta] No. - I'll go. - Violeta, why don't you go. - No, no, no hey Earl, I'm running this meeting. Have at it Natalie. - Hi, I'm Natalie. - Hi Natalie. - Alcoholism took my whole family from me. Didn't happen gradual, like how it does for most people. One day my dad was here and then the next he was gone. My mom stayed strong but she eventually just went right down the road with him. (dramatic music) And I thought they were weak. And so I hated 'em for it. - But you pretty much followed their footsteps? - Yeah, something like that. - I'm hungry and I need to pee. - It sucks to be you. - You're gonna have to let us go sometime or it's gonna get real funky up in here. - You know after that little rabbit stunt you pulled you'll be lucky if you ever see a bathroom again, all right? - You know what, I'm sick of you and I haven't had a drink in three years and I really want a drink right now! - That's interesting, that's interesting. There's a little truth right there. There's a little truth right there. Three years without a drink. Three years without a drink working with Earl and now you want one, now you wanna relapse. It's funny, Earl always says it's so easy. - No one said it was easy. Sobriety, it's not an end. - So what is the end? - That's for God to decide. - No, no-- - No, Johnny! - It's not your turn. It's not your turn. It's not time yet. What are you doing here Earl? You're here to help people right? - No. - No? If you're not trying to help people then what are you doing? - Helping people is also a means. - So what is the end? - Bringing people to the same love and forgiveness that was offered to me. - Nah, there's no forgiveness for you. - That's not true. - No, there isn't. There's no forgiveness; there's no redemption for you. Not after what you did. You don't deserve it. - You're right, you're right. You're absolutely right I don't deserve it and there isn't a day that goes by where I don't remember that if I only had the guts I'd be dead right now. - You tried to kill yourself? - Well that would have been a start. - But then I remember that the person I was died when I asked God for forgiveness. God-- - God what? God what? Forgave you of your sins? That is so, that is so infuriating. It's so ridiculous. That's so impossible that you could be, you could be evil. You could kill, you could rape, you could do all these evil things, and then one day you just say oh God, my bad and that's it, you're forgiven? - It's not quite that simple. - What, you can wake up one day and you can just smell the stink of the piece of filth you really are and then you just say hey God, forgive. John 3:16 and then all of a sudden, poof, you're a good person without ever having to earn it. - That's why Jesus died on the cross. He died for our sins. - You, you are not good. - I never said I was good Johnny, just forgiven. - Not forgiven by me, man. - Look, why don't you let these people go? - No, they, they have to be here. - This is not about them. - No, this is about you. Anybody else no why he's here? - For the same reason that brought everybody here. - No, no, no, no, no, not exactly. - So then why are you here? - Why am I here? - [Natalie] Yeah. - I don't know, why am I here? Earl, you wanna tell 'em why I'm here? I didn't think so. 10 years ago my entire reason for existence left me. When I was a kid, I was a good kid, faithful kid. I used to go to church, I used to go to Sunday school, Bible studies, all that thing, I had faith for a kid and then when I'm five years old my dog dies, but I keep my faith, I think it's God's way. Later on my mom died. My mom was great, but I keep my faith. I know it's God's way. A few years later my dad dies and that was bad. It was ugly and it rattles my faith but I'm trying to hold on and then I meet Gilly. Then I meet sweet Gilly. And any ounce of question or doubt about my faith has disappeared. She was God's glorious creation personified. I had it. I struck gold. (emotional music) Gilly, well I had been playing with the idea, you're gonna like this, I'd been playing with the idea of seminary. When my dad died I kinda put it all on the back burner. The day after I met Gilly, I applied. Everything was just falling into place. (dramatic music) Anyone guess what happened next? Anybody wanna guess what happened next? - I did. I was working in advertising and I was good. I had just landed a big account, the biggest. So, we celebrated, hard. I made the decision to drive home and I was really drunk. I hit and killed this man's wife. His pregnant wife. (melancholic piano music) - So you know we've all lost somebody Johnny. You know you're not alone in that. - I suppose. - [Natalie] So you can't lose faith, it's not worth it. - You wanna know what my faith was worth when I was trying to deal with the loss of my wife? When I was trying to deal with the loss of my family? I prayed, I came to God, I prayed some more, I came to God. I said there's gotta be some reason for this right? God's will, master plan, there's gotta be some cause to all this right? This too shall pass. And you know what comfort and ease it brought me? You know what patience and clarity it brought me? None. You know what brought me patience and comfort, booze. A lot of booze. - I get it Johnny, I understand and I'm so sorry for you but how is any of this gonna help that? This is not gonna end your grief John. - My grief will never stop. I learned that 10 years ago. This here, this is justice. This is comeuppance. We make our own. You know what Earl? I'm on to you, you're a fraud. You don't believe in your redemption. I can smell you a mile away. I know your doubt, your remorse. I can see it in your eyes. - Any remorse I feel doesn't take away from my faith in the love of God. It's the same faith you have. - My faith is long gone. - I don't believe that. - Believe it. - Would it help at all if I was to say I'm sorry? - What? I thought that's what this whole thing was-- - To you. Would it help if I was to say I was sorry to you? - I sincerely doubt it but I wanna hear you try. - I am truly sorry Johnny. I know I can never give you back what I took from you. I can never make up to you for what I've done, but I have spent every waking minute of my life since trying to make sure that others don't go down that same path. Love is real, forgiveness is real. The power to change is real. Miracles, Johnny, miracles are real. I have affected so many lives though the course of this work. You're right I don't deserve forgiveness. You're absolutely right. But the Lord has given it to me. And I, I have worked every day since as my way of saying thank you to him for what he has given me. - Nice, but you've also earned a gun to your head, man. You took away my wife. You took away my family. That's all I wanted, man. It's not that much to ask. I just wanted a family. I deserved that didn't I? They deserved it didn't they? They didn't get a chance. I just wanted a family. - I was raped. - It's not her turn. - [Violeta] Let her speak. I'm certain she's earned that much. - Fine. - I was 11 when it started. It was my father. I ran away when I was 16. I hated him. I hated myself. I ruined my life. I turned to, to drugs and alcohol and sex and anything that I could find that would reconnect me to the wholeness I once felt from my relationship with God. But then one day I realized it was all in vain because nothing, nothing can ever fill that hole in your life left by the absence of God. So, in order to begin to turn my life around I had to accept God and I had to forgive. Forgiveness is God's way. (sirens blare) - What's going on? - Oh, that's the SWAT team. - [Natalie] Oh God help us (Johnny sings off key) (phone rings) - Okay. - You're not gonna answer that? - Hostage negotiation is like a first date. You don't wanna seem to eager. Yo. - They wanna talk to you. Yeah, well I don't wanna talk to them. - Well you know they're gonna want something here. - All right Hick, just listen to me. I just need a little more time okay? - What for? - I'll tell you what, get me a bus, a short yellow school bus, a municipal driver, and no cops. - What are you talking about? - Just get me the bus Hick and call back. - Give me the phone, let me to talk to him. - Sorry Captain, he hung up. (radio chatter) - That's our call, we're going in. - No one's going in, he's my partner. - [Captain] Let them do their job. - You're not going in without me, simple. - Look, I get it, he's your partner but nobody's died here today, and I'm not gonna start with you. Jones, Buderek, you're on me, lets go. - Okay kids, they're coming in. - Come on, come on, you gotta let us go. This isn't gonna end well. I know you don't wanna hurt anybody. I know it; I see it in your eyes. You're just hurt. - Natalie, just sit, sit down please. Oh man, okay, okay. (suspenseful music) Hick, I'm gonna send you three hostages okay? - [Hickey] I want them all. - Well you're not gonna get them all Hick. You're gonna get three unless you get me some goodwill. - [Hickey] It's still what it is. - Yeah well, this is gonna be over real soon anyway. Call me back. - [SWAT Officer] Move 'em out, move 'em out boys. Let's go. - You said three, who's staying? - I don't know, that's, I suppose it's up to you guys. Who wants to stay here with me and the big kahuna? - I'm staying. - What are you doing? - I'm staying. Cherise put your hand down. - Baby, don't do this, let one of them stay. - Hey, if you're staying I'm staying. - No, you're not. - [Isaac] All right then you're gonna have to shoot me 'cause I'm not leaving my girl. - I'm going to have to shoot you? - [Isaac] I'm not leaving her. - Isaac, what is wrong with you? All day long, with that audacity. Don't you realize when a guy is on the edge? Why didn't I shoot you earlier, buddy? Why didn't I just shoot you earlier? Look at this, wow, whoa! You gonna listen to me now? If you love your girl you'll listen to me. You've getting on my last nerve every... - [Isaac] This is not gonna end well for you man. - No, it's not gonna end well for me at all. I knew that 10 years ago, this wasn't gonna end well for me. Okay, kids, I guess this is the last call. Last call, that's funny. Last call, you can keep on praying but you can't do it here. It's been fun. It's been enlightening but it's time to go. So long girl, you get on with your bad self. - [Police] Come out, come out! Let me see your hands! Move, move, move. - Are you sure? - Just go, just go, be smart, go. Just go, go, go, go, go with God. - Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. - Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) - All right, hey lover boy. Oh my God, chop, chop, man. Go Isaac, go, go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick like a bunny. Go Isaac. Goodbye Isaac. Don't worry I'll take care of your friend, so long. Drive safe. All right Natalie, come on up. (police order and yell) (suspenseful music) - It's gonna be okay. - Okay, and then there were three. It looks like we're going down. - No, Johnny, I'm not going anywhere. This is between you and me. Let Natalie go. - I don't have time to argue with you Earl. Just go, go. Turn around and go. - [Natalie] I can't see anything it's too dark in here. (punches thud) - Whoa, buddy boy, that wasn't smart. - Are you okay? - That was a pretty good punch, man. Help him up. Grab that candle there. All right, go, go, go, go, chop chop, chop chop. (door shuts) Okay. (dramatic music) - Earl, are you okay? - I wish you would call me Dad. - I don't think we're quite there yet. - Dad? - Yeah. - So you knew who I was then? - I saw you in court. My mother wanted us to see first hand the pain that he caused. I was with him in the police station when he got word that your wife had died. I watched the life drain right out of his eyes. I watched my father die right before my eyes. The man that was left behind wasn't my father. The man that was left tore what was left of my family apart. I haven't even been able to be in the same room with him for years. - So, what are you doing here now then? - I'm doing the same thing that you're doing here. - So, where's your gun? - We're both here to find out who this man really is now. - I came here to kill who this man really is now. - No you didn't. - If you came here to kill him you would've done it already. You came here to find out the truth. - The truth, the truth is he killed my family. - [Natalie] But none of this is gonna bring them back. - [Johnny] I know that. - So what is this then? Revenge? - Yeah, it's revenge, if that's what you wanna call it. This is revenge. - [Natalie] Listen, just because my father was still alive it doesn't mean I didn't lose him. All right, I know loss. I know the pain of losing someone you love. It hurts, there's probably no greater pain on this Earth but you gotta make a choice and I chose to live, to be a good person despite it all. You really think your wife would want this for you? - You don't know anything about my wife! - I know that you loved her, all right? You wouldn't be here if you didn't and I also know that you're a man of God. Listen, I had so much hate for this man for so long until I realized it wasn't hate. Everything I did to avoid him, to hurt him back, everything was because I love him. He's my father and I love him and now you wanna take him away from me just when I'm getting him back. You wanna take him away from me like he took your family away from you, who does that help Johnny? He'll be dead, sure, but he'll be dead with God. How does that help you? (dramatic music) - What, what? - I never thought I'd see those eyes again. - Those are the same eyes that he's had in his head since he got out. - That's because Jesus is in my heart. - And God forgives, right? - Yes, yes he does. - God forgives, well I don't. - [Natalie] No. - He killed my wife. He destroyed your family. He took my faith. He does not deserve forgiveness. - I know but what if we give it to him anyway. Because that's what faith is. - Just step down, step aside. - [Natalie] No I won't - Step aside! - Johnny look at me, John. It's not too late for you. You can come back. - What? - You can let God back into your life. - Shut up! - [Earl] Just ask for forgiveness, he will forgive you. - No, stop it, stop it! - Just ask. - It's too late, it's too late for me. - No, no, no, as long as you're still breathing it's not too late. - Dad, I forgive you. - What, no, no. No, no, this is not how this was supposed to go down. - And what were you hoping to accomplish here? - He needs to know that forgiveness is not an option. Not an option for you! Not here on Earth, not in Heaven. - That's not true. - What and you know that? - [Earl} Yes. - You know that? - [Earl] I believe that with all my heart. - You have no proof. - Yes I do, of course I do. I see evidence of it every single day. Lives restored, brought back, risen from the ashes of their own self-destructive actions. Johnny we all witness that everyday. That's what my faith is grounded in. - Johnny, if he can do it you can do it too. - No, no, no, it's too late, it's too late for me. It's too late for me, the only the thing that I have coming is Hell. There's no forgiveness for me. - Yes, yes there is. I forgive you and if you can't find it in yourself to forgive me ask God and he will do it for you. You have to know this isn't the right way. You have to know that. I mean in a universe of an eye for an eye we'd all be walking around blind. Is that the kind of world that you wanna live in? Well you don't have to. Choose forgiveness. Choose love. Look, it's a free gift for everyone. All you have to do is ask and you know something, you're absolutely right, we don't deserve it but he gives it to us anyway. (dramatic music) - You, you killed my wife. You killed my baby. You killed my angel. - Yes, yes I did. But we can't make right everything in this world Johnny. The starvation, the pain, ignorance, evil, it took me coming face to face with my own madness, my own brokenness, to realize that there was no way on God's green Earth that I could ever repair that with my own hands. I could live with my own emptiness in my soul for so long. If you can't find the power to forgive me within yourself trust me, ask God and he will do it through you. - It's just talk. All you do is just talk! - Think of it. If God doesn't forgive us, where does that leave us? We'd all be eternally guilty with no hope for redemption. Yet because he does forgive us we get to experience love, the true meaning of love in its greatest form. - And we don't deserve it. We don't deserve it! - You're right, you're absolutely right. We don't deserve it. But haven't you ever been given something that you don't deserve? And how did that make you feel? Knowing that someone gave it to you freely? Just as the son of man came not to be ministered onto but to minister and lived his life as a ransom for many. - That's Matthew 20:28. - That's right. Without God's grace, without his forgiveness we would all lose everything. I was exactly in that position. I had done something so tragic, so unspeakably wrong that I was lost, there was nothing else I could do. All I could hope for was his mercy. And I begged for it. I got down on my knees and I begged for that which I knew I did not deserve. But that's what grace is, Johnny, God giving us that which we do not deserve, his mercy. - But God, God commended onto us his love and that for we are sinners Jesus died for us. - [Earl] Yeah, Romans 5:8 - Romans, something like that right? - Yeah. Forgiveness that releases us from the bondage of our hatred, our anger. It also releases the one in bondage to their sin and their guilt from their deeds. (Johnny sighs deeply) - I just don't know. - Johnny, if God loves us enough to forgive us, why can't we? Why can't we say with Jesus Christ, father forgive them for they know not what they do? And then we can live free from the bondage of an unforgiving spirit. If our friends betrayed us or our family let us down. I mean the only answer to the problem is just to forgive. (Johnny sobs and mumbles) - Ask, just ask. - I've done so many, so many bad things. - [Earl] Just ask. God will forgive you Johnny. All you have to do is ask. (intense dramatic music) - Is that you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I have sinned. I have, I did it. Oh God! Forgive me, forgive me God, forgive me. God forgive me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - So am I. (dramatic music) - [Earl] Pray with me, pray with me - Okay, okay, okay. - God. - God. - [Earl and Johnny] Grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, the courage to accept the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference, amen. (Police yell and order) - I'm sorry, I said I'm sorry. - [Earl] It's okay. - I'm sorry. (Police yell and order) - What's your name? - Earl, Earl Winston. - Okay somebody's gonna be with you soon. (radio chatter) (dramatic music) - Are you okay? - Yeah. - The medics are on their way, you okay? - Yeah, we're fine. - What happened here? - What was supposed to. - Okay. Johnny's not a bad guy just a little lost. - Well I think he might be finding his way back. - I'm glad you're alive. - Me too. - Sorry you had to go through all that though. - Maybe. (dramatic music) (deep engaging jazz music)
