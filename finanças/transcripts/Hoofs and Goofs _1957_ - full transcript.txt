[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ALL: Hello. [♪♪♪] Hey, Joe aren't you-- Don't interrupt! Are you still reading that reincarnation stuff? Why, certainly. Bertie and I both believed in reincarnation. But our little sister Bertie's been dead for over a year. Yeah, but the swami says right here that we return to this earth in some other form. Perhaps an animal, or a bird, or even an insect. Could be. [FLY BUZZING] Drat that fly. Don't! Don't swat that fly. You may be hurting Bertie. Oh. Bertie, is that you? I guess not. Bertie, my long-departed little sister, you promised to come back. If you'd only send me a message or a sign or something, before I go crazy. Hey, Moe, we gotta do something about Joe before he flips his lid completely. Yeah, we-- Hey, I got a-- JOE: Gosh, Bertie, if you'd just let me hear from you, Bertie-- [FALSETTO] Joe. Joe, dear? Listen. Bertie, Bertie, is that you? Yes, dear, this is Bertie. Now you must be patient until I return. B-But when, Bertie? When are you coming back? Where will I meet you? Well, I, uh-- Today, this afternoon, 5:00, on Crown Street near Third. That's-- That's wonderful, honey. I'll be there. I'm so excited. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Poor Joe. He really idolized our little sister. You know, I think he lost his marbles. Yesterday he imagined he was a chicken. We'd better send him to an institution. Oh, we can't do that. Why not? We need the eggs. Ha-ha-ha! What's that? Oh, that's a hammer. Stop with the jokes. Come on, already. Boy, am I excited. It's 5:00, and we're almost at Crown and Third Street. Come on, fellas, hurry. Come on, hurry, fellas, hurry! [MOE GRUMBLING] WOMAN'S VOICE: Yoo-hoo, Joe! Yoo-hoo! Are you starting that again? That wasn't me. It wasn't? No. Hi, Larry. Hi, Moe. BOTH: Hi. Joe. Joe, dear, it's Bertie. Joe. Here. Well, don't just stand there. It's me. Bertie. Bertie, but-- Why, sis, it is you. I'd know those ears anywhere. Moe, Larry, gosh, I'm happy. Where's the wristwatch I gave you? Where it belongs, silly. See it? Bertie! Bertie! Y-You're reincarnated, you've come back. But, Bertie, you're a horse. So who did you expect, Kim Novak? Oh. I don't care what you are. You're coming home with us. But I can't go home with you, Joe. Why, sis? Why not? Because I'm in love with another horse. Oh, horsefeathers. You're not gonna break up our little family again. Now you're coming home with us for a little while anyhow. BERTIE: No, no, wait. Boys. Stop. Stop, you hear? You leave me alone. Now cut it out, you horse thieves. I won't have it. Do you hear? I won't have it. Get away from me. Cut it out, sis! BERTIE: You can't do this. Wait a minute. I'll stop that switching. Okay, kid. Down on the end there. BERTIE: I'm getting mad. [BERTIE GRUNTS] Ow, Bertie! That hurts! Now-- Now don't aggravate yourself. Remember your indigestion. Oh, my stomach is killing me. [BURPS] BERTIE: You upset me. See, I knew that. I was afraid of that. Now-- Now, Bertie, relax. BERTIE: Cut that out right now. That'll hold it. Let's get to work here. Oof! Oof! Ooh! Ooh! Why you-- Oof! [GRUNTS] This was your idea. It nearly-- Get out of here. [WHISPERS] Come on. Come on, Bertie. LARRY: Walk quietly, Bertie. On your tiptoes. BERTIE: Now remember, I'm only going to stay a few minutes. MOE: Come on, Bertie, easy does it. JOE: Yeah. No noise, now. I hope the landlord didn't hear us. Yeah. BERTIE: Wait a minute. Shh. Quiet, Bertie. Fellows, I can't stay. Well, here we are, Bertie, in our new home. Yeah, I'm surprised at you. Yes. MOE: Bertie, you stop this nonsense, act like a lady. BERTIE: Let me out of here. I'll kick the place down. [THUMPING UPSTAIRS] What? Oh, thank you very much for the cracker. [SPEAKS IN GERMAN] Oh, my cake! What is going on up there? The idiots we rented to upstairs. Is that so? Well, I'm going up to tell them something-- [COUGHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh, Papa! BERTIE: Now take me back to my wagon. Come here, now. Take me back. What's the matter with you, Bertie? Oh. Oh. Oh. My stomach is killing me. Well, take it easy. I got some wonderful stomach pills. Hurry up and get 'em. BERTIE: Oh, it hurts... [BERTIE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [BERTIE GROANING] Oh. Something I ate, maybe. Here you are, Bertie. Open your mouth and swallow this pill. I can't swallow pills. See? Oh, you're stubborn as a mule, but I'm ready for you. Here, I'll help you blow it in. Now open your mouth. Come on, Bertie, that's a good girl. Come on, open your mouth. [BERTIE MUMBLES] [COUGHING] Good, good for you. What happened? Bertie blew first. Bertie, you're bad. I'm going upstairs and give those guys two pieces of my mind! Gosh, Bertie, you sure draw flies. It's lucky I got some fly paper. BERTIE: Wise guy, always sounding off. There. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] DINKELSPIEL: Open the door! It's the landlord! The landlord. Quick, put Bertie in the bedroom. Hurry up. Bedroom. BERTIE: Easy, easy guys. Shh. Shh. BERTIE: Now what? What's the matter with you? Why you don't come to the door? And what is with the plaster falling down, and the tramping around here like a horse? We got no horse here. We were dancing. You was dancing, but the plas-- [SNIFFING] Smells like a horse. Ooh, I want to go home. Shh! Be quiet. I want to go home. He'll hear you, the landlord. [NEIGHING] That you fellas-- [BERTIE NEIGHING] Ahem. It's my bronchitis. Awfully bad this time of the year. I was-- [BERTIE NEIGHING] It does not sound like bronchitis to me. Well, maybe it's because I'm a little hoarse today. Get out of here! Shh! Shut up. Again with the tramping! And that was not you! There's definitely somebody back here. Come out of that bedroom. I hear-- [BOTH CHUCKLE] See, Mr. Dinkelspiel, there's nobody here. BERTIE: You'll wish I hadn't come. [SCREAMS] [GAGGING] LARRY: Be good and we'll take you home tomorrow, okay? Okay, I'll stay. Tomorrow sure. Larry. Yeah? Get Bertie into the closet. Hurry up. Come on, Bertie. Shh. Shh. Where we going? The closet. [GRUNTING] Who made out the lights? Who turned-- I can't see nothing. Mr. Dinkelspiel, take it easy. Don't you tell me what I take it-- You make enough trouble here. Please, please, relax. Oh, that's you. BERTIE: Fellows, stop. What are you doing that for? JOE: You promised, Bertie. Where is that coming from? I find you wherever you are, I smell you out. Wait, wait, Mr. Dinkelspiel. Hello. You sly little devil, you. So it was a lady, huh? Yeah, my girlfriend. Well, now, Mr. Dinkelspiel, everything is all right. Yeah, everything except my glasses. My spectacles, I lose them, and I can't find them. Here, just a minute, here they are. Oh, you found them? I found them. Oh, that's nice, now I can see-- Nothing. Okay, okay, we'll see you in the morning. Yeah, but I don't see so good. Something must have gotten-- Well, good night. Good night. You know something? It's dark out here. [DINKELSPIEL SCREAMS AND CRASHES] Did you get hurt, Mr. Dinkelspiel? DINKELSPIEL: No, I fell on my head. Okay. You nearly gave us away, Bertie. Oh, shut up. You give me a pain. Boy, that was a narrow escape. Quick thinking, fellas. [SNIFFS] Phew. Boy, no wonder Dinkelspiel said the place smells like a horse. Bertie, you're gonna get a bath. And how. You need it. Come on. Yeah, come on, Bertie. BERTIE: You guys don't smell like lilies either. Bertie, when we get through with you, you'll look like a pewter dollar in a mud hole. BERTIE: Hm, this I like. Hey, the drug store was open. I got the bath salts. Good, open it up. That's the stuff. Okay, Bertie, we'll have you fixed up in a minute. We will fix you up real nice, Bertie. Everything will be all right. It'll-- You'll shine. Why don't you watch what you're doing with that water? Oh, a little water ain't gonna hurt you. It ain't gonna hurt you either. Just for that, I'm not gonna let you have a ride on Bertie. There. Aah! Ooh, that hurts. Hurry up, fellas, I feel simply awful. Okay, Bertie. Quit horsing around, you guys, we gotta clean her up. Okay. Okay. Hey, Bertie, go get me a towel. Okay. Hurry, come on. Thanks, Bertie, you're a doll. I'll dry you off so you won't catch cold. Now we'll get this water. And this. Hey, Larry. What? Ooh, I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean it. Get a towel and dry that face off. Ask me nice. That's nice enough. There it is. Now she looks like my ex-mother-in-law. My bow looks pretty. I got the cologne on her. If my horse friends saw me like this, they'd give you what for. I bet they'd laugh at me. Never mind your friends. Look, Joe, I told you things are different. I'm a horse now, and that's not all. The fact is, I'm going to have a baby. Oh. Oh, my goodness. A baby. Oh, Joe, please do something quick. I'm about to become a mother any minute and for goodness' sake, hurry, hurry. Moe, Larry, get some hot water. Plenty of hot water, uh, cotton, and the first aid kit. Hurry, just don't stand there. Hurry! Bertie, take it easy. Oh, boy, we're gonna have a baby. [CHEERS] [CHUCKLES] Hurry up with that water, Moe. Okay, I'll be right with you. Oh. Oh, Joe. Easy, now. Don't worry, everything will be all right. I feel so tired. Gosh, it's hot. I'm warm. Bertie, you wanna catch cold? Now you just take it easy now. Just be good now. Joe, hurry. [CHUCKLING] Whoa! Ooh! What happened? What the Sam Hill? Those stupid idiots. Who left the chair in the way? I'll kill him later. Hey, Joe. Here. Yeah? Put on this mask, open this can of ether. You're the anesthetist. Don't call me names. Where's that Moe with that hot water? Go. Go, already. All right. All right! [GRUNTS] [CRASHING] [MOE SCREAMS] I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't know you were behind there. Help me up. Strictly an accident. There it is. You okay? Yeah, yeah. What's the matter with you? Just what I wanted. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [GRUNTING] [SPITTING] Now how did that hole get in there? [SPITTING] [GROANS] There, Papa, drink your milk. It'll make you sleep. Ja, thank you. I drink the milk. Ah. Good night. Papa. Don't sleep here, go to bed. Hurry. Look, Joe. Oh, what's the matter with him? Take these. Why, the sap. He knocked himself out with the ether. The can's empty. I'll bring him to. Come here, kid. [GURGLING] What--? What happened? Bertie! Bertie! She's alone, she's alone. Hurry up. JOE: Bertie, Bertie, we're coming. LARRY: Yeah, we're here. You're too late. Oh, my goodness. A baby, a baby. LARRY: Oh. Oh, boy. A beautiful baby. Little thing. Oh, come here, honey child. Let me see it. BERTIE: Don't drop your nephew. I'm an uncle, I'm an uncle, I'm an uncle! I'm an uncle, I'm an uncle! I'm an uncle, I'm an uncle. Oh. I'm an uncle, I'm-- I'm an uncle. Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. Come on. Wake up here. Come on, you're dreaming, kid. Oh, boy, was I dreaming, and how. Oh, what a dream. Boy, I'm glad that's over with. Gee whiz. Come on, boys, scram. I wanna set the table for dinner. Oh, Bertie, am I glad to see you. I had a terrible dream. I dreamt that you were a horse! A horse? Yes. Why, you worm! Oof! [SPITTING] Bertie, no salt. [♪♪♪]
