(dramatic orchestral music) (lively energetic music) (lively contemplative music) (dramatic orchestral music) (lively energetic music) Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the gypsy fair. We have come from the far corners of the earth just to give you pleasure. (Chuckles) Our music will make you think you're in paradise and our dancing girl will make the young men's blood boil and the old ones wish that they were young again. It's all free, absolutely without charge. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up so that there will be plenty of room for all. This way, right this way. We will meet Rhoda. She reads the secret of the human palm, locates lost and stolen articles, and correctly describes all events of the past, present, and future. Ladies and gentlemen, the great Rhoda! Chico and Cheena, they foretell the future and reveal for you the secrets of the past. Chico? (Chico squawking) (light playful music) (horse whinnying) (Valdi grunting) [Anube] Didn't I tell you to get Carla? Yes, sir. Since when does Carla look like that? I thought, I thought Gus, Gus would help me. Does it take two donkeys to find her? Go now and bring her. Hurry! Yes, sir. Gus, we've gotta find Carla. I-I'll get her, sir. I'll get her really. Gus, go. Should let the donkey ride you. Yes, sir. I will. But his teeth are green. [Horse Handler] No. Yes, they are green. Yes, my friend, they are green. That comes from eating grass, which in turn produces this silky, glossy coat I take pleasure in calling to your attention. But he's thin. Never before have I seen a horse so thin. Yeah, yes, but the horse is fat inside. This pushes the bony structure to the surface and makes him look thin. If the horse were fat outside, you would know that he was thin inside. (Chuckling) Outside, inside, outside. Yes, my intelligent-looking friend. Bah! (light playful music continues) I can't even sell a horse without that girl. Where is Carla? Carla? Carla? Carla! Carla! (gentle mysterious music) Carla! (Valdi sighing) Carla! (gentle whimsical music) Anube wants you. The whole place is full of villagers and they have so much money in their pockets, it, it tingles. Anube can wait. Some people think about other things than money. But we don't go around talking about it. Hurry, Carla, hurry. Anubi wants you. Hurry, please. (horse hooves clomping) (dramatic suspenseful music) (dramatic tense music) (dramatic ominous music) (dramatic suspenseful music) He left the dead man. You could see him through those bushes. You look, I can't. It's too gruesome. You see nothing. Remember that. We gypsies get blamed for everything. For everything. I I saw nothing, I heard nothing. To tell you the truth, I'm not even here. But Carla, Anube said for your to hurry. Who is he? Who is who? The man who rode away. He's dead. No, I mean, he fell off. If it's that, no, I couldn't. I don't know. Please hurry. Hurry, Carla. You know how angry Anube can get. I don't give that about Anube. I know, but he'll blame it all on Gus. Let's make it fast, please. Hurry, Carla. Gus, we've gotta go fast. Let's go. Oh! [Anube] Are you ready? Yes. (light playful music) (whip cracking) Hmm, they have no appreciation of art. All they understand is a pretty girl. I will show them what an expert whip snapper can do. (crowd members laughing) Are you ready? (tambourine jingling) (energetic lively music) Are you ready? Yes! (whip cracking) (energetic lively music) (gentle violin music) (crowd clapping) (chuckles) They like my trick. Maybe I don't need Carla. Are you ready? (gentle violin music continues) (energetic lively music) You're beautiful. (energetic lively music) Just to make sure you heard me. (energetic lively music continues) Her cheeks are red, her eyes are bright, her hair is black as wing of night. Let no blond man in her sight. (Chuckles) (energetic lively music) (crowd clapping) (energetic lively music) Who is he? (energetic lively music) You have the look of a love sick calf. Time this foolishness was ended. When a man marries, that lovesick look leaves his face. That's easy to say, Father. (lively energetic music) (fist pounding) When you knock and no one answers, why do you continue to knock? I cannot stop when I'm worried. Worried? What are you worried about? - That man. - What man? The man who was killed. Fool, what are you talking about? What man was killed? I didn't know, my chief, I never saw him before. When I went to find Carla, I saw a man pull an arrow from the man's back. Who was he? The man who was killed? No, you fool. The man who pulled the arrow. Was he one of my tribe? Yeah. Oh no, my chief, no. No, it was... Shh! It... (tambourine jangling) (energetic lively music) Um. He's gone. Who's gone? The man who wasn't here. The man who wasn't here. They will blame the murder on the gypsies. We must move on at once. Pass the word. (Valdi hiccups) (energetic lively music) (crowd clapping) (dramatic suspenseful music) (crowd chattering indistinctly) (dramatic tense music) My lord, Abube and his tribe are your humble servants. You're leaving? But gypsies never linger. That's what I observe. Follow me. You only arrived yesterday. If I were sensitive, I might consider that a slight to my hospitality. Forgive us, my lord. It is our custom to move on. We sing, we dance. We read the past and foretell the future. That's good. Then you can tell me who among your tribe killed this man. Well? His body was found near here. Do you know him? No, my lord. How could a poor gypsy know such a fine gentlemen? You know nothing. Nothing? Well? I await the name of assassin. I give my solemn word, my lord, that not one of our tribe killed him. The word of a gypsy. (Laughing) We are not assassins! Hmm, what's your name? Carla. A lovely name for a lovely gypsy. Perhaps Carla, you can look into your cards and tell me the name of the murderer. I tell you without looking into my cards that it is not a gypsy. Forgive her, my lord. - She's young and spirited. - So I see. Now we'll put an end to all this. I command that you bring forth the murderer. But Your Excellency, we do not permit murders in our tribe. Why, if we ever find one such, we murder him. Quiet, you fool! We cannot produce what we don't possess. [Baron] Then you're all under arrest. I'll hang you up by your thumbs until you or one of your tribe confesses. (hiccups) It was not one of us, sir. It was someone else. - [Baron] Who? - Shh! It was the- (tambourine jangles) I don't know, sir, but if none of us killed him, it must have been someone else. Extraordinary. Pay no attention to him, my lord. His sole friend is a mule. Has become difficult to tell the two apart. Captain Marver, clear them out of here. Get them in the wagons. Take them to the castle. [Guard] Stand back! Get into your wagon! Get your people into the wagons! (crowd grumbling indistinctly) You will learn nothing by taking these gypsies to your castle. Perhaps I'd learn more if I took you. Perhaps. And perhaps you have no need of learning more. Who are you? My card. (dramatic suspenseful music) Why, you isolant cur, you! (tense dramatic music) Captain Marver! (tense dramatic music) Follow him! Bring him back with that arrow. (tense dramatic music) (dramatic ominous music) (horse hooves clomping) (dramatic lively music) (dramatic ominous music) (water splashing) (gentle suspenseful music) (horse hooves clomping) (gentle whimsical music) Hello. Have I told you before that you're beautiful? What are you doing here? I saw you leave. You knew I was coming here? Yes. You are riding straight into a trap. The baron's men know this country. You don't. You do evidently. There is a road below here. Take that one. Who's that? Oh, that's Valdi. He's watching me. Watching? Yes. (Michael laughing) Valdi! (rock thudding) (both laughing) (Carla laughing) Why have you done all this for me? I saw you pull the arrow from the dead man. You believe I killed him? [Carla] No. Appearances are against me. There is a voice within all of us that never lies. Appearances often do. A voice was talking to me while you were dancing. Did you listen to it? I had to. It was shouting at me. Over the music? Over everything. You smiled at me while you were dancing. You dropped a coin in my tambourine. You sell your smiles? Kisses, too? (hand smacking) (chuckles) I deserve that. Listen. The baron's men? No, no. Our inner voices are talking to us. What is yours saying? A beautiful gypsy girl smiled and danced her way into my heart. And mine is saying- - Keep me there and never let me go. (gentle romantic music) (Carla chuckles) Good luck charm? It seems to be working today. Yes, for me. (donkey braying) What? (light playful music) Carla! Carla! (Hiccups) They're coming! Eh, Gus, we'd better, we've gotta go. Now wait a minute, now wait! Gus! Carla, they're coming! Carla! Gus, wait! Hurry, please, before they find you. Where are you going? I am going back to my people. (gentle calm music) [Michael] Hee, boy, hee! (dramatic lively music) (light gentle music) If we had not come here, we would not be in such trouble. If, if. But we have come, and we are in trouble. 'Tis done. (light gentle music) [Tonio] You are beautiful. Oh, I thought... Yes, I know. I say it with my violin. The stranger speaks it with his lips. Which do you like best? So long as they're said, I am pleased. I will teach you to love the words of my violin better. As soon as we are out of this trouble, my father will read the bans and we will be married. (gentle romantic music) Maybe your father will want you to marry another girl. Another girl? For me, there is no other girl. Ever since we were little, I dreamed of no one but you. And when we are married, we will have a wagon to ourselves. Like the one we wanted when we were children. It will be painted light blue and- - It will have red wheels. Yes, yes, and I'll paint your picture on each side so that everyone will know it is our wagon. It was a lovely dream. We'll make it come true. What's wrong, Carla? Is it that you do not like me? I do like you, Tonio. I have always liked you. But not well enough to marry me. Is that what you're trying to say? Please, Tonio, I don't want to talk about it anymore. It is the stranger. You speak to me, but you think of him. Yes, Tonio. I do think of him. I cannot help it. (gentle melancholy music) (dramatic suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music) (dramatic suspenseful music) I need your help. I'm in trouble. (chuckles) He is in trouble. The baron's men, they're close behind me. Then let them catch you and roast you over a spit. [Michael] You believe I killed him? [Anube] Well, someone killed Count Orso. [Michael] Ah, then you did know him. We were on our way to see him. If you are so innocent, why were you running away? You and your tribe are innocent, yet you are running away. The gypsy gets blamed for everything. Then hide me and I promise to help you. I'll find out who really killed Count Orso. Then you and your people will be free to go. He speaks wisely, Anube. If they do not find the murderer, one of our tribe will hang for the crime. I will hide you. Good. Get back in there. (whip thudding) [Rhoda] Why did you strike him? To deliver him to the baron personally in exchange for our freedom. (gentle light music) The stranger! Anube's going to hand him over to the baron. It is what he deserves. Where is he? In Anube's wagon. Carla, stay here! Carla. Carla! (gentle suspenseful music) What are you doing? The soldiers are after him. He begged me to hide him. He begged you to tie him up? It was my own idea. See he does not get away. With pleasure. (gentle calm music) Help me, Tonio. Please. (gentle calm music) Get your violin. If they come, play. I will sing. My father told me to stay here. Your father wants to deliver him to the baron personally. If that Captain Marver gets him, we will not be able to bargain for our freedom. Tonio. Please do it for me. I am a fool! But I'll do it. Hurry, please. Hurry. (gentle calm music) Why did he come here? Dodging the soldiers, he said, if you care to believe him. Don't you? He doesn't look to me like the kind who would dodge anything. Then why? For the same reason that you came running when you heard he was here. How did you know? I'm a fortune teller, remember? Here. (gentle calm music) (dramatic suspenseful music) Soldiers! [Captain] Halt your caravan! Hold! (gentle violin music) Why do you stop us? Yes, we're on our way to the baron's castle. I am aware of that, but I have reasons to search our wagons now. Search? We have nothing to hide. We- That is for me to decide. - Who's in here? - Why, no one. Suppose the violin plays and sings by itself? No, I, I mean to say is that, that there's no one there except my son and one of our girls. Of course, if you'd like to search some of the other wagons, why... I prefer to look into this one. (gentle violin music continues) I'll go in first. Stop that noise. Is there anyone here who does not belong? No one but you and your men. [Captain] Who's that? Why he's, uh, he's, uh- - He's our clown. Yes, and when he's awake, he makes people laugh. It is very tiring being a clown. He sleeps most of the time. (Chuckles) Even when he's asleep, he's very amusing. Wake up, wake up. (Michael grunting) (Anube and men laughing) Does he always sleep so soundly? Always. The way he sleeps, you would think he was hit on the head. (Anube and men laughing) Your jester must be a very funny fellow when awake. Oh, in all the world, there's none who can cause such laughter. (Anube and men laughing) (Carla and Tonio laughing) Quiet, men. Outside. (Michael moaning) Did, did, did you ever hear such funny noises? (Laughing) Stranger who insulted the baron, did he come here? Oh no, mi capitan. He would not dare come here. You know if we lay our hands on him, we turn him over to you. Yes. Anube. You will not deliver him to the baron. You cannot. Is either him or one of us. It would be neither if you only allow him to find the real murderer. We have found him. He did not do it. How do you know? If he were guilty, I would know. I would feel it. Ah-ha, then you are more in love with him than I thought. Then you will not do it? Carla, I've looked after you ever since you was a little baby. I have too much affection for you to do anything to hurt you. Oh, Anube! (kisses smacking) I love you. Yes, you love him, you love me. That's what causes all the trouble. Too much love. Oh. What happened? Michael, you'll be safe with us. (Carla laughing) (dramatic ominous music) (dramatic violin music) (tense dramatic music) (lively energetic music) My lord, I trust that you and your guests are enjoying our humble effort. I am grateful for permission to entertain you so you know my people better. See how they dance! Listen to them play! How could any of them have murder in their hearts? They're like little children, simple children. You're annoying His Lordship. He desires your entertainers, not your oratory. Oh, but of course, a thousand pardons. What would it be? Singers, dancers, acrobats, jugglers? Captain Marver informs me you have a clown who made my troopers laugh even while he slept. Oh, clown. Why, why, yes, but I thought to save him for the last to leave you and your guests in the best of spirits. Our spirits need lifting at the moment. You will bring the clown before us. It shall be as you wish. The clown first. (energetic lively music) We are lost. They want the clown first. Me? But what can I do? Why don't you try sleeping? The soldiers thought you were funny while you slept. Fall down, make faces, act crazy like Valdi. But I don't know how. Leave it to Gus. Well, I'll try. (energetic lively music) (men laughing) (energetic lively music) (men laughing) (energetic lively music) (men laughing) (energetic lively music) Wait. (crowd talking indistinctly) Tonio, my music. (energetic lively music) My lord, that clown. Bring him to me. (energetic lively music) (energetic lively music continues) (crowd clapping) Come sit here beside me. It's a pity your clown ended his performance so abruptly. I thought him very amusing. He's very clever. Yes, he's clever enough to make us think he's a fool. To laugh at us while we laugh at him. Since he was interrupted, I've sent for him to complete his performance. He has disappeared, my lord. Well, allow no one to enter or leave the courtyard. Bring the gypsy leaders to me. You know this clown very well? No, my lord. I am barely acquainted with him. You sent for me? Yes. Where is the clown? The clown? Clow? What? Who can tell about a clown? [Baron] You are no doubt aware that he is the stranger I'm seeking. The clown? Stranger? Oh, I wouldn't have believed it. (hand thudding) You will cease this pretense. Yes, my lord. Now tell me what connection does this stranger have with your tribe? None. He came to our fair to have his fortune told. I'll tell you what his fortune is. It's death when my men find him. Now, my dear, who is this man? I do not know. You will tell me who he is or I'll force the truth from you. The iron! (dramatic ominous music) I regret the necessity for such violence, but you leave me no other means. She's telling the truth. She does not know this man! Please, my lord, he is my son. He means no harm. (soft dramatic music) No, no, no, not Carla! You can't do this! (punch smacking) (soft dramatic music) What's stopped you, Baron? Your courage, my dear. (soft gentle music) [Michael] I thought I'd save your men the trouble of searching for me. Your consideration shall not go unrewarded. [Michael] In the manner of Count Orso, my lord? I rather expected you when I was about to put the branding iron to the lovely young gypsy, but you didn't rise to my bait. Well, what do you want? Release the gypsies. You fool no one by bringing them here as your scapegoats. They must stand trial. I am the law here. There is the king. Do you think the king would listen to a lot of vagabonds? Might listen to me. (chuckles) Another vagabond. No, a court messenger. Court messenger? Does that surprise you, my lord? What are you doing here? I was sent here by His Majesty, the King, in response to an appeal for help by Count Orso. Unfortunately, I arrived too late to save his life. Perhaps you can explain why the arrow I found in the body of Count Orso had a red shaft and a gold crest, strangely like those. I might have mislaid one. In a man's back, my lord? (Baron scoffing) I'm sure you're mistaken. I I'd like you to examine them a little more closely. They were made expressly for this bow. Get away from there. Now drop that knife, or I'll pin you to the chair from the front. That should be quite a novelty for you. That's the difference between us. You wouldn't kill me if my back was turned, while I... (tense dramatic music) (candelabra clattering) (tense dramatic music) (punches smacking) (tense dramatic music) (dramatic ominous music) (knuckles rapping) My lord! (fist pounding) Open the door, Your Lordship! Answer me! Are you all right? Yes. (tense dramatic music) Order him to release the gypsies. All of them. Release the gypsies. The girl, too? Yes, the girl, too. Break it down! (ram thudding) (tense dramatic music) (dramatic suspenseful music) (gate rumbling) (tense dramatic music) (dramatic suspenseful music) (tense dramatic music) (punch smacking) (tense dramatic music) (dramatic suspenseful music) (water splashing) (tense melancholy music) (tense dramatic music) (punches smacking) (dramatic suspenseful music) (gate rumbling) (wagon rattling) Goodnight, guard. [Guard] Goodnight. (wagon rattling) (Michael whistling) (soft dramatic music) Oh! Wet this. (tense suspenseful music) Hurry. We've got to get him away from here. I've done all I'm going to do for him. Oh, Tonio, please. He's an outsider. He's not one of us. You've done enough for him, too. He's hurt. He is hurt? (horse hooves clomping) Soldiers. (dramatic ominous music) Have this cleared up to be attended to. As I was saying, Marver, that is the famous Orso pendant, the only one of its kind in the world. [Captain] What became of it? Supposed to have disappeared with the Countess Orso some twenty odd years ago. [Captain] Then why worry about it? Because that pendant has reappeared. [Captain] Where? On the throat of the gypsy girl, Carla. Come here. Now these are the vital statistics of the Orso family. Carla, infant daughter of the Countess Orso, lost at sea with her mother. Suppose that child was still alive. Then these estates would belong to her. Exactly. There's always a possibility that the gypsy girl is not the daughter. And there's always that pendant. How can you prove it? Force the truth out of the gypsy chief. Follow me! (soft dramatic music) (whip snapping) (tense dramatic music) Wait. Hold it, Captain. We found Carla and her mother. Their ship had been wrecked. Where? Varna, on the Black Sea. The countess was dying. She placed the King's pendant around the baby's neck as proof of her birth. Of course. Why didn't you tell us this sooner? Would've saved all this unpleasantness. (dramatic ominous music) Let him down. Take him back to the dungeon. (tense dramatic music) (soft gentle music) It's only Tonio returning with your horse. You'd better leave me here. The soldiers- - That's for me to decide and for you to rest. (Michael sighing) (soft gentle music) Tonio. Tonio. Go and watch. You can see the road from over there. When the soldiers come, warn us. He can take care of himself. No. He needs our help. Stranger rides into our camp and everything that was beautiful dies. We're in trouble now. Thanks to him. He brought it on us, killing that man. He didn't kill him. The baron thinks he did. So do I. I told you I'm not gonna do anything for him. Then do it for me, Tonio. Well, I'm a fool, but I'll do it. - Oh! - (kiss smacking) (soft gentle music) You are a most unruly one. You sit up when you should lie down. He's in love with you. All gypsies are in love. (gentle violin music) Listen. Our gypsy song of freedom. I heard it yesterday in the wagon. Yes. We always sing it when we're in trouble. (gentle violin music) Of course, the noble thing would be for me to ride out of your life, but I don't feel noble. I feel wonderful. (gentle violin music) (gentle dramatic music) Fools! (dramatic lively music) [Carla] Tonio! Tonio! (dramatic lively music) (dramatic ominous music) (dramatic lively music) (horse hooves clomping) (dramatic lively music) (tense dramatic music) (dramatic ominous music) (water splashing) Carla! Carla! He's gone! You! I ought to bury this in your heart. That wouldn't answer anything. Where's Carla? The soldiers are here. She rode off on your horse to lead them away. (tense dramatic music) (horse hooves clomping) (dramatic ominous music) (water splashing) (tense dramatic music) [Guard] Night patrol, one prisoner. [Guard] Open the gate. (gate rumbling) (dramatic suspenseful music) They'll put her in the dungeon, maybe worse. We've got to get in there, Tonio. Our best chance to help them all is from the outside. What can we do on the outside? A lot more than we could do if we were locked up in the dungeon. Are you coming with me? No. I'm going to ride for help. I'll call the other gypsy tribes. (gate rumbling) (tense suspenseful music) (water splashing) (dramatic melancholy music) (dramatic ominous music) (dramatic suspenseful music) (tense dramatic music) I hope you've been made comfortable. Release her. You may leave us. Please forgive them. They're overzealous. Allow me. You have no need to fear me. I don't. There's a sudden change in your manner. Yesterday you wanted to burn me. That was only a rouse in the hopes that the stranger might show himself. [Carla] Why are you so determined to capture him? I want to hang him for the murder of Count Orso. Then why do you hold my people? For harboring a murderer, helping him to escape. How long do you intend to hold them? That depends on you. On me? What did you want me to do? Marry me. Marry you? Why should you, a baron, want to marry a gypsy? Besides, I don't love you. I shouldn't think the prospect of being the Baroness Tovar should be so horrible. (knuckles rapping) Excuse me. What is it? Excellent, Captain, excellent. If you will come with me, I'll show you a portion of the castle which I know will interest you. I believe it might influence your decision. Would you mind? (men laughing) (dramatic ominous music) Good shot! Wait till I come closer! (arrow thudding) Stop it! Stop it! Michael! Michael! Michael! Stand away, Carla. They'll kill you. This time, closer! Captain Marver, hold your arrows. (soft dramatic music) Anube! Anube! Don't worry. Anube will be all right. - Who did this? - Shh. The baron. They will all die if you keep them here. A gypsy cannot live unless he's free. It is for you to say when they shall go free. As the Baroness Tovar, you're every wish would be obeyed. Don't do it, Carla. You mustn't! You can't! [Anube] We would rather rot in here. [Rhoda] Yes, we would rather rot! I wish them to be freed as soon as possible. The marriage will be performed upon the arrival of the high sheriff. The keys to the dungeon will be my first wedding gift to you. (royal triumphant music) (soft gentle music) My, you'd make a lovely bride. It's the prettiest dress of the lot. Whose dress was this? It was last worn by Countess Orso, wife of him who was killed. What became of her? Her Ladyship and her baby were lost at sea. And when it happened, Count Orso locked everything up just as she'd left it. That happened over 20 years ago. (knuckles rapping) Oh, dear. I'm coming. Coming! (soft dramatic music) Good morning, my dear. [Servant] Is there anything wrong, Your Lordship? No. The sight of so much beauty took my breath for a moment. She looks just like the painting. My dear, before nightfall, you will be the Baroness Tovar. Does it have to be today? The haste is for your sake. You want your people freed as soon as possible, don't you? Yes, of course. Michael, too. Micheal, too. All of you, I need your help. Carla is in trouble. She's a prisoner in the castle. Round up your men and follow me. Hurry. (men shouting) (tense dramatic music) (men laughing) Too bad we can't have a wedding everyday! Men, a toast. To the new baroness. And to the lucky baron. And to the gypsies we are going to set free. Yes, just like we did Count Orso. (men laughing) (light playful music) You're late. There's plenty of wine for all. Any change? No, the gypsies are having a good time and the young fella's still tied up. Then get along with you. (light playful music) Smile, Anube. We're getting out of here. I can't smile. The welts on my back won't let me. We'll soon be even for those. Where's the knife? - Anube has it. - Good. Mustn't fail Carla. No. Are your people ready? I'm sure, but I'll see. (light playful music) Queen of diamonds is your sweetheart. (light playful music) The king of spades is a man who doesn't like you. The hand is quicker than the eye. Watch this. Mmm. So far so good. The one at the door will be difficult. The most soldierly fellow, this guard. And handsome. You see, he's not all soldier. Are you? I'd soon show you if I didn't have to stay out here. Maybe we can arrange it. Eh, doctor? (all laughing) (wagon rattling) What's that? It's the high sheriff. For the wedding? Yes. We've no time to lose.

Michael! This way! (dramatic suspenseful music) Michael! Down there in the courtyard. Look! [Gypsies] Carla! Carla! [Driver] Hey! Heh! Heh! Let's follow her. (tense dramatic music) (logs thudding) [Michael] Carla! (tense dramatic music) Please guard, keep it closed! (tense dramatic music) (ax thudding) (gate rumbling) (tense dramatic music) Blocks, braces! We need braces! Yes, something to hold this! (tense dramatic music) Everybody up! Everyone up! Help! All together! (gypsies shouting indistinctly) (tense dramatic music) (horse hooves clomping) (gypsies shouting indistinctly) (tense dramatic music) Where have I seen that pendant before? Well, never mind about that. Can you perform the ceremony here in the coach? Here in the coach? Well, of course, if Your Lordship wishes it, it will all be legal and proper. (carriage thudding) Very uncomfortable, too. (horse hooves clomping) (tense dramatic music) Faster! Faster! If only the baron had our horses and we his! (tense dramatic music) (wagon clattering) (tense dramatic music) (horse hooves clomping) Then I must have a ring. That's part of your civilized ceremony. - Yes, yes, it is. - (Baron clearing throat) Of course, we can dispose of it. Did I ever tell you both about the wedding that I was officiating at some years ago? The bride was- - Never mind that now, Sheriff. Get on with the ceremony. (tense dramatic music) (horse hooves clomping) (tense dramatic music) (Baron grunting) I asked you to remove the ring, not the finger! If Your Lordship would only stop somewhere and get some soap and water. (horse hooves clomping) Fly, my beauties, fly! Don't let your feet touch the earth! (horse hooves clomping) There! Use this. Baron, that's the wrong finger. Oh. Your Lordship, forgive my saying so. That's the wrong hand. (Laughing) (horse hooves clomping) (tense dramatic music) (carriage thudding) Oh, I'm sorry! (horse hooves clomping) (tense dramatic music) (carriage thudding) Oh! I, I've found it! Ooh! Now I've lost it! (tense dramatic music) (horse hooves clomping) (water splashing) (tense dramatic music) (bow snapping) (tense dramatic music) Wait for the caravan. (tense dramatic music) (water splashing) (dramatic ominous music) (tense dramatic music) (water splashing) (horse hooves clomping) - (hand slapping) - Oh, Sheriff! Oh, sorry! (tense dramatic music) (water splashing) (carriage thudding) (horse hooves clomping) (dramatic ominous music) Get him off here! (horse hooves clomping) (tense dramatic music) [Sheriff] Look out, my lord! Take it here! (tense dramatic music) [Man] Yah, yah, yah, yah! Why are we stopping here? This is the end of the ride, Baron. Get out. Michael! (men shouting) Michael, look. (men shouting) Tonio! (tense dramatic music) Here, Carla. Take this. (tense dramatic music) (arrow thudding) Oh! Gypsies. Gracious me. (tense dramatic music) Can't be mistaken, but where? (arrow thudding) Well, another one. (arrow thudding) Oh, poisoned. Hmm. (tense dramatic music) (men shouting) Tonio! (tense dramatic music) Michael! Tonio! Son! [Carla] Tonio! Ah! (men shouting) Countess, save me! Countess? Countess, I've got it. I remember now. Countess. (Chuckling) Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to inform you that, uh- - Keep quiet. You were right, Michael. She is beautiful. (soft somber music) (dramatic sweeping music)
