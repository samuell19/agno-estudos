26TH NOVEMBER 1976 They say that only the fortunate find love. But some people rebel against their destinies for love. This is a story about the war between love and destiny. A FEW MONTHS AGO -Namaste. -Namaste. -Where is Mr. Paramahamsa? -He is right there, sir. Thank you. Sir, a few scientists are here to meet you. Sir, the government is building a new space research center. We want you to give us an auspicious date for its inauguration. We are going to conduct advanced research about these planets. And we're here to consult those very planets to decide upon an auspicious time? I really don't get it, Mr. Chandra Mohan. That's a very good question. Go! You seem to be suspicious, not inquisitive. I'm a scientist, sir. I can seek the truth only if I'm suspicious. I have a question as well. Will you help me with it? Go ahead. Do you know about the stars called Arundhati and Vasishta? Alcor and Mizar. They are twin stars. Scientists had discovered the telescope in the 16th century. But in a Hindu wedding, we've been following the tradition of showing these stars to the bride and the groom for more than a thousand years. Okay. Can you tell me how our ancestors discovered these stars… without the help of a telescope? Kepler's Law. You use it in your rocket science. I'm sure you're aware that Johannes Kepler, the scientist who proposed it, declared that astrological studies were the basis for his scientific research. Science is about trying to understand the unknown, not refuting its existence. Sir, there is always a person who is an expert in a particular field. Is there anyone who is an expert in chiromancy after you? Yes, there is. Every world leader wants to meet him. My student, the great Vikram Aditya. I call him the Einstein of Palmistry. Alright, ma'am. Please come with me. You're going to write an unforgettable chapter in this country's history. You're going to declare an emergency in India. Do you realize what you're saying, Vikram Aditya? Where is he now, sir? Can we meet him? He has left India. Why, sir? He's the only one who knows the reason. There's no home… There's no fear too Your destination is… Where you must be going Be with the sky Let this breeze be your companion Do what you are… Destined to perform here Fly away, angel! Fly away! Fly away, angel! Do not stop here! You have this sky given to you by God You just have to fly away there Be it the harsh cold or the flowery spring Enjoy every season on God's earth You have this sky given to you by God You just have to fly away there Fly away! There's just one life and you have it now Make every moment count Let blessings be on your lips And faith be in your heart Turn the impossible into possible! God is inside you Trust me, it is true The whole world is your oyster Who knows? Where you could end up tomorrow? This moment, you have in hand Live it wholeheartedly Fly away, angel! Fly away! Fly away, angel! Do not stop here! You have this sky given to you by God You just have to fly away there Fly away! Fly away! Fly away! Fly away! Fly away! Fly away! Fly away! What? I love you, Aditya. Don't. But I want to marry you. I am not the relationship-type. I am the flirtationship-type. I don't have a love line, Tasha. Sorry. -It's very chilly! -Yes. Can you handle me? Hold! Coffee? You're… -Hi! How are you? -I'm fine. How are you? Dr. Prerana, we need you in the general ward. Dr. Prerana, we need you in the general ward. Captain, inhale! Exhale! Inhale! Exhale! Come on, sir! Breathe! Inhale! Exhale! -Inhale! Exhale! Sir! -What's wrong? He wasn't administered oxygen because he didn't have a breathing problem! That's the reason he's holding his breath! -Sir! -Hurry up! Oxygen! -Sir! Sir! -Connect it fast! Hurry! -Fast! -Sir, hold on. Captain! Sir! Sir! -Breathe in, sir. -Oh, God! He's fine. Why do you need oxygen, sir? What is your problem? I've been here for four days! You've been conducting your stupid tests! Why haven't you started the treatment yet? We're not treating you because you are not sick. What do you mean by, "You're not sick"? My heart is beating faster than an express train. I have a ton of gas in my stomach. I am scared that I might explode like an atom bomb. Do you know what the color of my urine-- Sorry! The color of my urine is darker than single malt whiskey. -I urgently need an operation! -What the hell is he saying? Now! -It's called Nosophobia. -What does that mean? It means you do not have any diseases. But you have a fear that you have lots of diseases. Who made this idiot the captain of a ship?! Trust me, guys! I am sure that I'm really ill. I'm sure you'll find out soon enough. Don't worry. Sir, that's our line! "Don't worry!" -Is it? -Yes! Okay. Can I get the reports? -I'm going to conduct all the tests again. -Again?! And if the reports are clean, you need to leave the hospital! Prerana, can I get any other flavor of this oxygen? Okay. This crazy guy is gonna-- Guys, Dean! Dean! The Dean is here! Run! Run! Yes, tell me, how is the patient doing? -How are you, sir? -Idiot! Prerana, see me in my office. "Prerana, see me in my office!" Uncle… I had told you to stay away from the hospital for a few days, right? I am fine, Uncle. I don't have a fever anymore. Have a look! Are your test results back? Not yet, Uncle. I'll bring them to you right away after I get them. Okay, bye, Uncle. Auntie! Why do you have to practice early in the morning? Aditya, you jerk! You're making me wait in your house like a watchman while you're having fun all around the globe. Auntie, your curry needs some more coriander. The tamarind stew is too hot and the papad is overcooked. You can show off your talent at your perfume shop. Stop sniffing my food! If you criticize my food again, I'll cut off your nose and throw it away. -That's not what I meant, Auntie. -Enough! Your friend is back from his trip. Go, meet him! Okay. He's back? Hey! I've been stuck here for five years! I've been waiting for you! And finally, when you had the time, you took off to travel the world?! You're a useless friend! Get up! "I want to ski. Done." "Drive a taxi. Done." "Sleeping on the street. Done." Hey! Why don't you let anyone touch that bloody diary? What the hell do you write in it? People usually write about their past experiences in a diary. But he writes about his future experiences in his diary. He's scared about the fact that… we might read his diary and decode all his plans. Please include Auntie in your next plan. Good idea. Please take her on some adventures as well. Yes, take me with you! Actually, no. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here with me. If I stay here, you'll focus on me and stop practicing your dance. That's the reason I travel! What? I am the reason you keep traveling? Idiot! Of course! Do you think performing at London Dance Festival is easy? He has a point, Auntie. It's not an easy task to perform at the biggest dance festival in the world. It requires great practice, dedication, and commitment. I'm your mom. I know what's true and what's not. And I know you're hungry. Come on. "Vikram Aditya the Great" is gonna grow up only after he gets married. Mom, no marriage! Can you handle me? What? Catch. Aditya. She is an angel! Idiot! -Please, can you go fast? Please. -Okay. Hey! Hey! Get down! Stop! NAME -Name. -Name. WHY? -Why? -Why? WANNA WRITE A SONG -Wanna write a song. -Wanna write a song. NEXT TIME -Next time! -Next time! WHEN'S THAT "NEXT TIME"? -When's that "next time"? -When's that "next time"? IF WE'RE DESTINED TO MEET -If we're destined to meet. -If we're destined to meet. -No! -No! The two who weren't destined to meet, have met each other. Whose destiny is this meeting gonna change? Only those who are destined to find love Are the ones who find it You can never get it Even if you ask for it a lot This is the game of destiny And the magic of wishes It never stops once it starts The name you say out loud The heart will look for them Journey of fate might end with love The name you say out loud The heart will look for them Journey of fate might end with love Ms. Prerana… this isn't fan mail. Why are you giving autographs on each box? These are medicines! It's important to be a little selfish, Pyare Mohan. If we're not, God will take away all my credit. Now, I've donated the medicines. So, people must know that they must thank Prerana and not God, right? Thank you. Moving along in sun and shade With each other Why are they unaware Of what their hearts want? Like the clouds are always with the rain They are still worried After being for each other Whatever God decides will happen How can something happen by force? The name you say out loud The heart will look for them Journey of fate might end with love The name you say out loud The heart will look for them Journey of fate might end with love Only those who are destined to find love Are the ones who find it This is the game of destiny And the magic of wishes It never stops once it starts The name you say out loud The heart will look for them Journey of fate might end with love The name you say out loud The heart will look for them Journey of fate… Might end with love Aditya? Master? Mother! Namaste, Master! How are you? I am fine. How are you? We are fine, Master. He's been missing you. Please be seated, I'll get some ginger tea for you. Please come. Master, please come in. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I would have come to the airport to receive you. Well, you could've, or you could've disappeared to get away from me. If your mother talks about your marriage again, I'll tell her that you are already in love with a girl. Have you come this far just to say that, Master? Well, you've been asking me what I was writing for years, right? This is a chronicle of 70 years of my experiences. I want you to write the foreword for it. Palmistry 99% Science. Master, what's this? People used to dismiss astrology by saying that it's nothing but superstition. You're the one who taught them that astrology is a science. And now you're saying in your own book that it's not 100% accurate, but only 99% accurate. This is wrong, Master. Any treatise, for that matter, cannot be 100% accurate, Aditya. If God has written everything in advance, why did He give us the power to think? We think that we're thinking, but our thoughts are written in advance as well, Master. I can't let my name be associated… with something I don't believe in. And the next time my mom asks you about my marriage, tell her that I'm not destined to fall in love or get married. This isn't 99% right. It is 100% accurate. You are about to meet India's richest man. Be careful. Sir, Mr. Vikram Aditya is here. Anand Rajput. Vikram Aditya. Please be seated. Thank you for meeting me. I'm here because of my mentor's request. I can see your dreams and your zeal in your palms. You contested for the post of student president in your college, and won it twice. Your family didn't approve of it. And they sent you abroad for further studies. But you couldn't give up politics even after you returned. That's the reason you married a girl from a political family. I am impressed. I can see your interest in politics. Not your future. You destiny has business. And you are going to take over your company. 20th November. No! That's not my future. Check my palm once again. I don't have the habit of looking at it twice. You had predicted the imposition of an emergency in India. You haven't been living in India ever since. You're living in countries that don't recognize you. Help me in fulfilling my dream. And I can help you in fulfilling your dream of returning to India. Sir, your father! -Father! -Tell me. Vikram Aditya wants to talk to you. Sir, your son has no future in politics. I've read everything that's going to happen, right from my birth to my death. I don't need your help. Sir, don't get angry. I will talk to him. Move! Sir! Sir! Sir, just a minute. Hold on, please. Sir, listen to me. Sir, please stop. Sir, please listen to me. Sir! Hey! He's running! Catch him! Sir, please stop. Hey, catch him! He doesn't get it! Take the money. What are you doing? Are you an astrologer or bowler? Why are you throwing stuff? What the hell?! You'll hurt us! Stop! That's huge! Hey! Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Hey! Hey! Stop! Sir! Sir, please, stop! Hey! Emergency. Aditya? Prerana. What happened? It was bound to happen. Where is Aditya? He hasn't called me for two days. He doesn't tell you where he is going. Why would he tell me? -Hi. How are you? -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. -Good morning, sir. Aditya. Palmist? Yes, sir. He said that was his profession. What's the case? It's an accident case, sir. Why did you get so many tests done for a small accident? Who was the duty doctor? Prerana. Actually, it was a minor injury. But he had lost a lot of blood. Prerana was the duty doctor, sir. How did this accident happen? Because of Prerana, sir! I tried to commit suicide by jumping in front of an ambulance. Tell her that I can't live without her, sir. Please! Please, sir. Ask Prerana to come and see me. Okay, sir. I'll tell her. Hey! Thank you, sir. Did you really jump in front of an ambulance for Prerana? Yes, sir. Really, sir. True, sir. You should've told Prerana about it. Why did you tell her uncle? Uncle? You think you can get her? Do you know how many people have proposed to Prerana? She is absolutely not interested in love or marriage. Perfect! I've been waiting for a girl like her. I think we might have to scan your head once again. Hey, scanning? Can I get one scan as well? -Please, please. Only once! -What a crazy lot! Please, Doctor. Prerana is back. What is your problem? You're going to die for me? Okay, fine. Die. Come on, die! Let me watch. I do like you but not enough to kill myself, darling. It was a joke. Joke? Do you think death is a joke? Do you even know the meaning of death? Do you know how many people in this very hospital are fighting to live? Ask them! They'll tell you what death really means. No. no. I fear death as well. I practice dying for two minutes every day to get rid of that fear. What? What? Wait, I will show you. Yoga death! Very funny death! One. Two. Three! Hey! Aditya… Aditya… Hey! Aditya! Get up, Aditya. Aditya… -You are my enemy! -Why? And how? -Captain! -Yes? -I was dying happily! -But why? -You woke me up. -This is a lie. Kill me again, Captain. -Me? -Or I'll kill you. What have I done? -I will kill everyone! -Everyone? Why are you doing it? -No! -I love death. -Kill me! -I can't do it! -Kill me! -Shoot him! Sir, are you okay? Doctor? Sir! Sir! I am practicing death. Let's listen to the last act of the play Romeo and Juliet. The idiot wants to practice death! Is it a game? It gets easier if you practice it?! Happy dagger! This is thy sheath. There rest my love and let me die. -Prerana? Prerana! -Sis? What are you doing? I am practicing death, Grandma. Death practice? I will thrash you if you talk nonsense again. Get up! Grandma. -I'll thrash you! -I was just joking. You were joking? -Is this the way to joke! -Okay, okay. -Sorry, Grandma. -No, I don't want to hear all this. No! This is not-- -You keep quiet! -Sorry. Stupid girl! What is it? Were you looking for me? Stop fooling around. There are a lot of patients around. There's no one here. Tell me. Do you think you're Romeo? No! Romeo died for love. I am not like him. But I really am like Juliet. If you fall in love with me, you will end up dead. I won't fall in love. There are no love lines on my palm. I just want a "flirtationship". Flirtationship? We'll do everything that lovers do. Except love. Just flirtationship. I am going to be here for a few days. And I want to spend that time with you. If you are not interested, that's fine. I will never show you my face ever again. But if you do like me… Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m. I will be waiting for you. Well, if I don't come, you will never see me again? And what if I do come? What are you going to do? I will kiss you. Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m. I'll wait outside the hospital. He said he is going to kiss you right in front of our patients, at our hospital? How dare he?! Bloody good-looking bad fellow! He isn't just bad. Cheap fellow. Dirty fellow! Who does he think he is? He is going to kiss me?! He wants to be in a "flirtationship" with me?! Thank God you didn't tell him you're going to a medical camp. I will never see him again in my life. Did he travel 300 kilometers in the rain? On a bloody bike? Prerana, what are you doing? Please don't go, Prerana. He'll kiss you! It happened… After I left home It happened… After I left home No idea why I met her We caught each other's eye And we fell in love It happened… We fell in love It happened… After I left home No idea why I met her We caught each other's eye And we fell in love It happened… We fell in love Beloved's heart is lost It's lost And we fell in love It was a crazy night The heavens were pouring down She set right her tresses Disturbed by the breeze Her dark tresses enamored me And we fell in love It happened… We fell in love Beloved's heart is lost It's lost… And we fell in love And we fell in love Well, you've almost brought me home… No. Good night! How many times have we kissed today? Ninety-seven. Hundred's a lucky number. The batsman is ready to score a century. I am a good girl at home, alright? If Mom and Dad catch us kissing, they will throw me out of the house. Just get out of here before I fall for your words. Hey, Prerana! We don't care if you are going to keep kissing each other or play cricket. But take your hand off the intercom! Come on, man! People are fainting in here after listening to your conversation. Come on! They were playing so well! But they got out on 97. -Mom! -Mom! What? I'm working the night shift. Bye. Sweet dreams! Hey! Is the boy sexy? Have some water. Tell me! Your favorite breakfast! Tell me. How is it? It's outstanding. Your hands are magical. But the raita needed a little more cumin. I'm eating! What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Just shut up and eat. Hey, but-- Hello? Is this Mr. Vikram Aditya's house? Yes. Congratulate him for his century. Some girl had called. She gave me three kisses and told me to tell you that you've completed your century. Who's this girl? She must have dialed the wrong number. Oh, really? Who's the "wrong number"? You've given her the right address. She's some girl I met fifteen days ago. You've been meeting the same girl for fifteen days? I can smell some love story here. Did you like the surprise? You think embarrassing me is a surprise? Oh, you get embarrassed as well? No! Come! -Go! Go, sit there. -So, tell me, what did your mom say? Nothing. Tell me! Excuse me, sir! You are Mr. Vikram Aditya, right? No. Do you owe him some money? Shut up. I don't think he's the same Vikram Aditya you think he is. -He is the great palmist, Vikram Aditya. -Prerana, please. Who wouldn't know him, dear? They say that he can predict the future. He's the Nostradamus of India. I've heard great things about you. But I'd never imagined I'd meet you. Sir, I have a small request. This is my daughter, Tara. She loves sports. She wants to be an archer. Could you take a look at her palm and tell her fortune? What are you gonna gain if I tell you, sir? If I tell you that her future is good, it'll ruin the surprise. If I tell you it's bad, I'll shatter her dreams. Why do you wanna know about something you can't change? Please don't say that, sir. You changed my friend's life. He was about to commit suicide. But you told him that he had a bright future. He is a world-famous architect today. Everything you told him came true. Please do it. Dad, humans have reached the moon! How can you still believe things like palmistry? -Tara, shut up and show him your palm. -Dad! Please, sir. -What is he doing? -He can predict the future. He can predict the future. He's a palmist. Sports are not where her fortunes lie. Ask her to focus on her studies. She'll be more successful. I haven't decided on my future yet. How could you see it? Tara! Sir, I'm very sorry. She is a kid. It's okay, sir. Can you tell me if my first child will be a boy or a girl? My station. I didn't know that there are so many crazy people in the world. I mean, I just casually said that you're a palmist. And they just started begging you for their fortunes to be read. What happened? Aditya? All their life lines were incomplete. And they are all together. What? This train is going to meet with an accident. Aditya! Aditya! The train that departed from Rome today morning at 10:00 a.m. met with an accident. -About 100 people have died. -Oh my God! And many more casualties are coming up. There are still many people trapped under the rubble and rescue missions are on the way. About 20 people have been rescued and have been moved to the hospital. The death toll might be more. We're just awaiting the authorities to confirm. We should have more news about this in an hour. Who doesn't know him, dear? They say that he can predict the future. He is the Nostradamus of India. Here you go. How is Aditya? Why are you asking me about him? You know that I have your best interests at heart, right? If you really believe it, stay away from Aditya. I am telling you this for your own good. I don't get what you mean, Uncle. You are in love, Prerana. That's the reason you don't get it. You can't think about this logically. Does he know about your condition? The condition that you are in, you'll always be far away from the people you're close to. Pain is all they'll get. Not love. Prerana, we've come far away from the shore. Just tell me whatever you wanna say, okay? Can we really change our destiny, Aditya? No, we can't, Prerana. I got very emotional that day and tried to stop the train… Tell me. What's written in my destiny? Are you sure? I might read what's not written as well. That is what I want. I've seen many palms. But the lines in these palms are decorated with stars. I'm seeing it for the first time. Be careful. These stars can be deceiving. There's lots of melodrama in your love line. Love will find you. But for you to get that love… you'll have to fight that love itself. He's about six feet tall. You're gonna have cute twin babies. Just like you. Life line… Your life line is exactly like you. Full of life… You give people a reason to live. On your 40th birthday… you will fulfill your dream of opening your own hospital. At the age of 74, you are going to receive a prestigious medical award. Prerana. Prerana. Doctor! Uncle… Call him. Prerana. Prerana! Open your eyes! Can you hear me? Open your eyes, Prerana! Move! Move! Move! -Prerana! -Sir! Three charges given! Sir, she is not responding. Prerana? -Get Dexamethasone. -Okay, sir. Close the curtains. Sir! Sir! What happened to Prerana? Don't you know about her condition? Condition? What do you mean? She is suffering from an incurable rare tumor. This disease is incurable! We don't even have the technology to figure out what stage of the illness she's in! We just know that… she has a couple of months to live. Do you think death is a joke? Do you even know what death is? Can we change our destiny, Aditya? How are you feeling, Prerana? Is it possible for me to experience the future… that you predicted for me in the next two months? Leave, Aditya. I can't put up a good act of death as you do. I've seen what these doctors or these reports or… these machines couldn't see. My predictions have never been wrong. And it will not happen in your case either. You have a long life, Prerana. Every single thing that I saw on your palm, you are going to see it yourself! What the hell are you doing? Stop this nonsense! I've had enough of this drama! Get out! Security! It's true, sir. Prerana is gonna be alright! She has a long life. You won't get it even if I explained it to you. -Please, sir! Sir! Sir! -Get out! Please… -Get lost! Move! -Stop, sir! Sir! Your fate is much stronger than these medical reports! God has written it, Prerana! Nobody can change it. If anyone asks you, tell them… Vikram Aditya has said it! Sir! Come on! What are you doing? I am leaving, Pyare Mohan. Back to my ship. Back to work. -You're leaving? Why? -Yes. After watching Prerana, I've realized the value of life. She was dealing with many problems. But she always remained happy and positive. And here I am. I don't have any problems, but I kept bothering you anyway. Sir! We will miss you. Okay, anyway, Pyare Mohan… this is my ship address. Keep me posted about Prerana's health. Sure, sir. Of course. Every single thing that I saw on your palm, you are going to see it yourself! You have a long life, Prerana. Hello? Hello. St. Joseph's hospital? I am calling from Destino Hospital in Rome. I had sent you a patient, Prerana Chakraborthy's file. What's the analysis on that? Your patient won't survive for more than three months. She is in a very advanced stage. I'm shocked to know she is still alive. It's impossible. She is in the final stage. She has a few days left. Prerana? What are you doing, Prerana? Are you going to believe some nonsense spouted by a palmist? We are doctors, Prerana. We trust medical evidence. Not predictions. I believed in science when I was a doctor. Now, I am a patient, Uncle! I need hope more than I need evidence. The only hope we have is medicine. Don't ridicule 40 years of my experience based on what a palmist said, Prerana. Uncle? No doctor has ever said that I'm gonna live. And Aditya said I cannot die. Aditya's predictions have never been wrong. The world knows it! And, I've seen with my own eyes. I can't watch a logical, strong, and intelligent girl… get swayed by this foolishness! Belief is good. But the truth is greater than belief. Only medicines can save you. Not these superstitious beliefs. And I'll tell him that after I meet him in person. What are the cases for today? He died of a stomach infection. We don't know the cause of her death. We need to conduct an autopsy. Give me the handprints of all four dead bodies! Like this! Our students need a dedicated library. This church isn't used for praying anymore. If this is converted into a library, -the students could use it. -Sir, Vikram Aditya. Hi, sir. I've heard a lot about you. Well, your tone tells me… that you haven't heard good things about me. You take a look at a palm and predict the future. Do you predict the past just by listening to the tone of one's voice as well? I called you here because I wanted to witness your talent. Tell me the future of these ten people! Right now! Let me see how "great" you really are! What is this, sir? What are you doing? It's for Prerana. She's really suffering right now. She had accepted her future. But you've given her false hope because of your stupid prediction! And I can't convince her. But… I can definitely prove that you're a fraud! Prerana's gonna live a long and healthy life. -That's the truth. -Stop it! Stop this nonsense! These handprints belong to five people, not ten. Two hands each. This is a male. Age, 74. He got married twice. He died of a stomach infection. A woman. Age, 23. Murder. She was poisoned. She was pregnant as well. We haven't completed the autopsy yet. Actually, he is right. We conducted the autopsy this morning. That's what the report says. Age, 45. Suicide. The poor guy was in debt. Thirty-one. No… Thirty-three. Street artist. Drug overdose. Those are the Dean's prints. Age, 61. He is a well-respected doctor. He's very successful and fit as well. He is alive. Do you want me to give you the place, the cause, and the date of his death? Will Prerana really live? Uncle! Did you meet Aditya? If Aditya says you're gonna live, you're definitely going to live. I don't know how. I am very happy today, Aditya! What do you want to do? A beautiful ballroom, hundred dancers, and me dressed in a beautiful gown… dancing with you. You can dance? Your father says that he wants to help you become the world's biggest businessman. And all you're interested in is politics? He recently went to Italy to meet Vikram Aditya. What did he predict? He said I was gonna take over my company on November 20th! That's today. Yes. Correct. But here I am, playing golf with you guys. Your father… You are going to take over your company. 20th November! Boys are like these bubbles. They keep hovering around us. And when you try to catch one, they disappear. My Aditya isn't like that. Your Aditya? He isn't like the other boys. He traveled 300 kilometers in rain to talk to Prerana. -Yes! -Really? So, when are you gonna tell him? I'll tell him today after dinner. Short and sweet! -Welcome! The Princess! -Thank you. Mother, this is Prerana. Namaste, Auntie. -This is for you. -Hello, Prerana. How sweet of you! The sari is really pretty, Prerana. It reminds me of Banaras. Do you know, in Banaras-- Mom, I'll show her the house. Come! My mother liked the sari a lot. Red is her favorite color, you know? Your mother's eyes are very beautiful. -They're very classical. -Yeah! Did John Lennon take your autograph? Come, this is my room. Wow! My dad. -When I was young… -Oh, sorry. Adi, did you cook this dish for Prerana? You can cook? You're good with food. You're good with words as well. Why isn't a good "homely" guy like you married yet? Sit down. I'll be right back. Flirtationship with Tasha. Today, for the first time, I met an angel on a train. I was really worried that I might finally fall in love. Even time itself couldn't stop that moment. Who are you? I thought… maybe the stars had made a mistake by making us meet. But I've understood that… the universe loved making the mistake of making us meet. I used to get rid of all the people in my life. But I just cannot get rid of your thoughts. Dinner is ready. How is my curry? -Not bad. But Auntie's dish is better. -Thank you. Sorry. Sorry. Hi. Hi. Hi! Meet him. This is Vedanth, my worst friend. Mother's favorite son. Hi. Earlier, you gave her your phone number and now you've brought her home. Are you sure that there are no love lines on your palm? Okay, everyone. All the best for the London Dance Festival, Auntie! -All the best, Mom! -Thank you! Well, I'll need three kisses with the toast! I am so sorry, Auntie. Actually, that day… Thank you. Do you believe in all these? Well, after I met you… I've started believing in miracles. -I want to say something. -I want to say something. You go first. Prerana, time just flew by when we were together. You beat me at my own game of flirtationship. After my mother's performance at the dance festival, I'll move to a new country, Prerana. I won't be coming back. What? Why? I will come with you. I won't even ask you where we are going. I just want to be with you. Please, Aditya. I cannot live without you! I love you-- There are no love lines on my palm, Prerana. Ninety-nine percent! Aditya! How are you? I am fine, Master. How are you? Well, I'm just surviving by writing books. Palmistry 99% Science. I really wanted it to be true for a moment. What changed, Aditya? Prerana walked into my life. Our fates don't meet. But why are we meeting? Are my thoughts wrong? Or is my treatise wrong? Any treatise cannot be 100% right, Aditya. Believe it or not, this is the truth. Have your predictions ever gone wrong, Master? Sometimes, I really wish my predictions could go wrong. But after I met Prerana, I couldn't even bear the thought of my predictions going wrong. The future I saw for Prerana has to be 100% true. Every time I read someone's palm, I predict their future with 100% accuracy. Like you! But only 99% of the people listen to me or believe my words. There will always be that one percent… who neither believe me nor their fate. They write their fate themselves. I've never come across anyone from that one percent. Those one percent are the ones who run this world. They have the power to change their fate. History itself is a testament to their stories. I'll have to bid farewell to Prerana today. How will I say it? Can I even leave after I tell her that? I have to go, Master. It was great meeting you. Good luck. A master shouldn't read a disciple's palm, right? How much more am I gonna live, Aditya? I've read the palms of many great men during my lifetime. You're the only one left. My last day with Prerana… Today, I hand over the responsibility of looking after my mother to my best friend. Aditya, no! I'm going to leave everyone behind, all those who loved me, and those who I love. Everyone! Vikram Aditya will be lost in the depths of the ocean. I don't need to fight with my future. I just need to witness the future I've seen… come true. No, I am really scared of death as well. I practice dying for two minutes every day to get rid of that fear. I am going to be here for a few days. And I want to spend that time with you. Prerana. My child! You are going to live! Yes! Yes! You are going to live, Prerana! You are going to live! William Sydney Cancer Foundation has found a cure for your disease. They are starting human trials next week! You are right, Prerana. Aditya's predictions can never go wrong. He's always right! He is great! Why have they complicated neurosurgery so much? No matter how many times I read it, I just don't get it. -Look-- What? -What is he doing here? What are you doing here? I need to speak to Prerana once. Tell me what you want to say to her. I'll convey the message. I would like to talk to her. No need! You either tell me or you leave. Are you sure? -Yeah, sure. -Yes. -Really? -Yeah. Okay. What? What is he doing? He is proposing to you. Could you please give this gift to Prerana? Hair clip? You made a big fuss about giving her a cheap hair clip? You are looking at its price, not at its value. When Prerana and I went out on a date for the first time, I saw a cute smile on her face when she saw this clip. But someone had already bought the last clip. I rushed towards him! But he got away! But I got his bike's number. I took two trains, three buses, and a horse carriage ride! I finally managed to track him down. Tell me, how much is the clip worth now? 500 bucks? After I had worked so hard, I found out that the bike belonged to a rental agency. And the person who was using it was a tourist. From South Africa. I wrote to him! I sent him telegrams! No reply. I made 57 international calls as well. 5000 bucks?! I tried really hard but he refused to give me that clip. I got the exact clip made in gold, studded with diamonds, and gave it to him. That is when that rascal sent me the clip. -50,000 bucks?! -50,000 bucks?! Finally, I got a parcel that had the clip. My mother saw it and thought it was for her. I lied to my mother for a cheap hair clip. I told her that this isn't mine. What is the price of lying to my mother? Priceless. We were happy when we met. Let's break up happily as well. Please. I'm leaving tomorrow. But I have a small request before I leave. One huge ballroom! Hundreds of dancers! And one last dance. Okay? Okay. Thank you. You can dance, right? Definitely, you will know. Thank you. See you, bye. Beautiful. Forget about the past and the future. Let's live this day… like it is our last. Tell me What's this love? You gave me this dream for the first time The fragrance of your breath Can be seen in my eyes They silently are talking to my feelings There shouldn't be lines That separate after meeting with the hands I wish with all my heart Let this love not be true Write a new path Let this love not be true Write a new path Let this love not be true For me… You gave me A reason to live Let's visit all the places Being each other's shadow Life is a journey Millions meet and part ways here Don't be stubborn about promises Pain is hidden in this Let this love not be true Write a new path Let this love not be true What? Prerana… do you realize what you're-- The train accident changed my life. I lost the man who held my hand and taught me how to walk. And my hand as well. They're both gone. I dreamt of becoming an archer. Is it just gonna be a dream? For the first time in my life, I want to know what the future holds. Will you tell me about my future, Aditya? What? You think people who don't have a hand don't have a future? This means that I can make my own future. Good luck. You have surgery tomorrow, Prerana. I won't be able to perform the surgery if I see you like this. I can't forget Aditya, Uncle. But Aditya said he wasn't destined to fall in love. And you are ruining your life for that love. Aditya is wrong this time, Uncle! And I'll prove it! No one can change their destiny! All the older gentlemen are smitten by your mother's performance. You know, I was so nervous. I did well, right? Did it go so well? Yes. Mom, I'm leaving. Are you going to meet Prerana? No. No. She is a really sweet girl, Adi. She loves you a lot. You often leave me alone. I put up with it because I'm your mother. But don't leave her, Adi. You've been looking for love in your palms for a lifetime. You would've found it if you looked for my love instead. Because I've found your love, Aditya. If only one of us can live, it's gonna be you. I am going to prove your prediction wrong. You're gonna live a long life. If anyone asks you, tell them that Prerana gave her life for love. Yours, Prerana. There will always be the one percent… who write their own fate. Calm down, dear! Dad! Hello? It's me. Aditya. Aditya? Where did you go? I've been trying to contact you for the past two days. How is Prerana? Prerana's had a huge accident. Her condition is really serious. We're gonna conduct the surgery in an hour, but her chances are… She doesn't wanna fight to live. I want to talk to Prerana. One minute. Prerana? Prerana? Look! She moved her hand. Prerana? Look! She reacted. I love you, Prerana. I love you. Can you hear me? I'm sorry, I know I'm a little late. You are my life. Now I want to spend every single second of my life with you. If you can… die for me, I can live for you. I'm coming for you. You'll live for me, right? Answer me, Prerana. Hey! I am coming for you! You must live. I am coming! Name, Prerana. Age, 26. Chief Surgeon, Dr. Chakraborthy. Assistant Surgeons, Dr. Victor and Dr. Samuel. Time, 12:08. Date, 26th November. Stop. Stop. I need to get to the airport. It's very urgent. Airports are closed for a week due to heavy rains. I need to go to Rome. Emergency. There's just one way. Captain! Somebody is getting into our ship! What do you want? Why are you climbing? Hey, give me your hand. Hey, Aditya?! Come, come! Aditya, what are you doing here? I need to meet Prerana urgently. I've heard that this ship is going to Rome. Okay, okay. Come. Let's go inside and talk. We're ready to depart. I really miss my son very much. Roxie, come up. What's this? Captain, we need you in the control room. We are trying our best. But we can't be certain right now. Oh my God! Hey, what happened? -I don't understand the weather. -Is it? Okay, let me check. We've received this, sir. Oh my God! It looks like a Tsunami. Move… Prepare for an impact. Brace for an impact! Full power! I need full power, guys! Everybody, hold on! Hold on! Captain! The lightning conductor is broken. Captain? What happened? You, go! Go! Take a life jacket immediately and go to the boat! Abandon the ship! Guys! Everybody, leave! Go! Sir, this is the last boat on the ship. Did you check the entire ship? I checked the entire ship, sir! There is no one left. Please, get on to the boat, sir. Please! The one percent… they write their own destinies. Prerana! Prerana! Prerana! We've left someone. We'll have to go back. Impossible, sir. If we go back, we all will die. I don't give a damn. Take the boat back. Hi. Do you think you're Romeo? No. He died for love. I'm not like him. Fate isn't the line on your palms. It's the result of your actions. She's an angel! Idiot! -If we're destined to meet. -If we're destined to meet. I can't live without her! I'll kiss you. How many times have we kissed today? And let me die!
