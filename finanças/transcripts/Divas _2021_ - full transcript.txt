It will be a face mask then, not a moisturizer. I'll wake up with such greasy skin tomorrow. - Is it oil or water based? - Read it. I've already read it. - By the way, it's water. - Okay. Sonofabitch! I'm gonna pee. - Look at Máté! - Look at his surprised face! Why are you surprised? You've never seen anything like this before? No. I haven't seen anything like this. But of course, our story didn't start here. By the way, I'm Máté. And I'm going to tell you how I met these three girls. I was 26, and I had no ideas for my diploma film, once I decided to take the tram instead of the subway. As I was walking, I was trying to figure out what interests me the most. I really wanted to find out why can't I become a proper adult, who's not anxious about silly things, like choosing between the tram and the metro. Then I turned to my side. Across the street, there was a special school. The Belvárosi Tanoda. This is where this story begins. Or, on this bench, to be exact. This is where I met these three girls. Szani. Tina. And Emese. Or, as they are known here at the school: The DIVAS On our first filming day, we met in this café which is their favourite place. I only knew a few things about them: they haven't finished high school yet, although they're all 20 years old. The rasta girl on the right is Tina. She is a quiet humble girl, who really longs to be loved. - Caress me. - Why? Because I asked you to. She has a boyfriend, and became interested in spirituality. She lives with the guy's family and she works at a cinema, to have some money for herself. - What are you taking again? - What? - What are you taking again? - Antacid for the coffee. The "antacid girl" is Emese. Unlike Tina, she loves to speak. Obviously, it's also something like a distorted reality... Look, his leg is so cute! Oh my god. Instead of a boyfriend, she has a cat, Igor Yesenyn. She used to be an art student, but now she wants to become a theoretical physicist. She still lives at home, but she works at an art pub besides school. I'm sure they weren't over 18, so they shouldn't come back. I've been waiting for something to happen. - Hey. - Hey. Your eyes look nice! And she is Szani. She is definitely the loudest, especially when she's displeased. Fucking hell! Why are they telling me this bullshit? - Why can't they tell me right away? - They told you. She doesn't have a boyfriend, but she's trying hard. That guy really beefed himself up. He was so ugly last year. He is ugly this year too. She has changed apartments more times than schools. She has been living alone for a while. To be able to afford that, she works at a karaoke bar. Let me know if someone is coming behind me. - Okay, we will. - I can't see. Soon, turn to my right. Which is your left. As I was following them, I thought I couldn't have picked an easier topic. After all, what could happen to three 20-year-old girls? I couldn't have been more wrong. Is everyone here? I welcome everyone in today's student gathering. Is there anyone who wants to tell or ask something? Or share? Or disclose, or whatever? Zsuzsa's performance is cancelled for today but you gotta do the dishes. - What class will you have? - Grammar. Examinees! Raise your hand if you're doing the high school exam, and must attend that grammar class! One, two, three, four, sheesh... As I mentioned, the Belvárosi Tanoda is a special school. He is the principal. This is the bell. And every student has a personal mentor. All students here have gotten into trouble with the school system, so this is their last chance to get a high school diploma. There is another school, just two blocks from here. That's a traditional school. They wanted to expel me from there, more than once. If they'd expelled me, I also could've ended up here. And 8 years later, here I am. Fortunately, I don't have to do that final exam anymore, but I'm trying to find out how they got here. Or at least to understand what it means to be a Diva. My head hurts. Do you want a painkiller? - Do you have one? - Of course I do. At first, we only met at the school. For example, during class. I didn't understand a word. Or, during recess. Have you seen Szani's new profile picture? She's so ugly. At the café. Right! You got your nails done yesterday, why this colour? In an elevator. You still haven't started the new season of 'Wives in Luxury'? At one of the benches at school... Only soccer players match me on Tinder. What's wrong with them? ...or at the other bench. Then the girl goes, "It's not a lip balm, it's a lip-gloss." Then, I suddenly found myself in a girls' sleepover party. Now we'll hold the camera, so you can tell us how long it's been since washed your hair? - I do wash my hair. - That's a big fucking stereotype. Of course, that's why you two stink. - I haven't washed it in five months. - Oh my god. Okay, now that we're together, let's decide on my nails. These are the options: Grey-- Next time, I'll get pastel first, then burgundy. I don't give a shit about yours, we're discussing my nails! - Can I do my makeup now? - You want to do your makeup too? I mean, I want to remove it. Right, yeah. What a prick, he's always filming me from my bad side. Why does he always stand close to me? Dunno. I always feel he stands too close to me. Now you can see that Tina always stands between us. It turns out that she's always in the center. What? - She wants to be the center of attention. - Says Szani. At least I admit it. Does it matter? I'm the leading character. It's so great, that whenever I talk about this to people, I always tell them, "Well, a guy is making a film about me and my bitches." My psychologist says that you are my maids. Blow me. I always say that he is only filming me. And then I tell them that it's also about two losers. Szani, Tina, and Emese. I knew that together, they are the Divas. But all three of them have their own lives. And I wanted to know about that, too. Máté has requested to join the DIVAS group Tina accepted the request. Szani accepted the request. Emese accepted the request. Hello Divas! I'd like to start a new thing if you don't mind. I want you to make a video of yourselves every day. Do you think you can make it? I've just got home from Vienna. It's midnight and I have school tomorrow, so I will be quick. Vienna is a cool place, but the stuff I brought home is even cooler. Hi, Máté. Vegan ravioli with spinach. Vegan ravioli with shitake mushrooms. Some meat substitute with soy sauce. I just watched Kingsman. That always makes me realize three things: that I'm broke... Tofu. ... that I'm ugly... I look awful. And it makes me very sad, that I look like this. ...and that... and my clothes suck. And that humanity is shit, but we already knew that. One day, Tina told me that she broke up with her boyfriend, and she is moving out. She invited me to join her. TINA: I think I managed to break up with him. But it was very difficult. TINA: We're on the way to pick up my stuff. SZANI: Come on, tell us. I'm proud of you! - Tüni, Tüni! Pay attention! - Oh, right, sorry. To the right. Right now? What is this crap is talking about? By the way, he's not the ex. Or a new boyfriend either. He's just Ricsi. Who helps them whenever he can. That's why there are so many potholes on the roads, so that the tire dealerships don't go bankrupt! And he's holding the camera like this. Should I leave the microphone here? I think, it would be cool to take Máté up with you. They'd see him with his camera, "What the fuck?" "I became a movie star!" You are stupid... - So, can I go up with you? - Or, I don't know. - I would take him up with me. - Do you want this? And introduce him as my new boyfriend. - You don't want this? - No, thank you. Right. Let's go, Máté. I already broke up with Kristóf so... - Wipe your face please. - Oh, sorry. - Come on Máté! - Okay... Silly. I think we can go. I don't have anything else here. Bye Pedro. Isn't it weird to move away after such a long time? Yes, you should ask things like this. Instead of listening to me. Thank you for your question I was just trying to forget it. So, you fucked it up. - Yes! - Sorry. Anyways, it's not weird. I felt really bad here. Ricsi knows this best, I told him everything. But what was so bad? I had to belong to a family, and conform to them. So, we will show how to do reverse with the handbrake. This is new to me too. I can't adapt to a family because I never had a normal family either. In this video, I'd like to introduce my boyfriends. I have been dating him for almost a year. He's a passing relationship. With him, I've been together for about two years... I don't know when our anniversary is. We've been together for three or four years. With him for more than a year. I'm trying out something more complicated now. Máté, get dressed. - Oh yeah. - This is our stop. Okay. I just wanted to say that... - Can you hear me? - I can hear you. I feel bad showing you my back while I talk. It's okay. I wanted to say that you can ask my parents anything but my sexuality. Because, when... I think I was 13, when I told them that I'm bisexual, and they all laughed at me. Since then, this has been forgotten. It was such an embarrassing moment, that... Since then, I haven't talked about this, so they never knew if I had a girlfriend. So... That's the only taboo topic, but everything else is handled openly... Okay. ...regarding me. Ok, I wouldn't have asked about this the first time around. Why not? Hi Makó! Igor darling, eat please! Actually, I did tango for a while and I liked it, but... It was really late, and I hated that even if I had a shower afterwards, I felt the smell of every man whom I danced with. It was horrible. I wouldn't have imagined that you danced. I wouldn't have imagined you as the dancer type. - Why? - I don't know. Because I'm fat? Because I don't have any muscles? Not because of physical ...reasons. Then why? My first impression of you is this 'artsy girl'. That hurts a lot. - Yes? - Yes! - Really? - Yes! - I'm sorry. - You don't have to say sorry. I'm the only one to blame if you feel like this. Hello. - Hey guys. - Hey. - Good afternoon! - Hello. - Hello, Attila Stumpf. - Máté Kõrösi. Hello. - Igor. - Attila Stumpf. Intense, huh? These are very nice colors-- This orange, it blows my mind. It's so unbelievably beautiful. These are all highlighters. I don't understand who puts this on their cheeks, this is a very dark color. Even though I don't like it when two metal objects touch each other, I find the sound of scissors really beautiful. It sounds amazing, probably because of the grinding. I watch Harry Potter films with this. I haven't ordered my magic wand yet. Is that an eyeliner? - Are you asking if that's an eyeliner? - Oh, right... I don't even have time to live. Especially not to record fucking videos for you! Fuck you Máté! I mean it! So Szani baby is working five days in a row? Even today? While her nails look like this? And... And like this? I can't go to the manicurist, 'cause I don't have time for it. I can't go anywhere, to my beautician, because I don't have time for it- Thank god, I have an appointment on Wednesday, whatever. To get my eyelashes done... Is it like this every night at the bar, or was this a special occasion? You came at the worst time. It was a fucking shitty day, I can't remember anything. I can't even remember if there were any guests at the bar. - Were there? - Yes. - Who... who hosted them? - You did. Me? - You must remember something. - No. You cocksucking rat! And what did I tell her? Something that you've never told anyone. What? That you almost slept with Balázs yesterday. Who? Wait a minute... You said something like that outside... - With Robi, no? - Yes, with Robi. Fuck... I can't even remember and I shouldn't have told her that. To that girl? - Yes, because she is dating with him. - No... You told it to another girl. - Which girl? - The receptionist. I told her too? You were smoking outside and you were crying. I cried? I'm so fucked up. I don't remember a thing, but I hope my makeup is fine at least. For fuck's sake! Are you really recording me when my make-up looks like this? Okay, maybe I did cry. It had... It had been an emotional few hours. And... Wednesday is the new Monday. Really. First time in my life, we had an actual fight with Szani. Szani projected onto us that she can't handle her emotions. To be honest, it was a misunderstanding. All of us had a shitty day. It hurt me what she said how she shouted and cursed at me, I can't really handle this. I didn't react the way I should have, and neither did Tina, so we had a fight. But in the evening, Tina called me and apologized, and I apologized too. So we discussed it. There is love and everything. Yes, Szani there is love. Today I went to Madal Café and I looked to my left, and Emese was sitting there. I was sure that I wouldn't sit next to her, because it wasn't me who had to start the conversation. I said, "What the fuck, you saw me coming in?" And she said, "Yeah." Then she came- or she asked me to sit beside her, because she had more stuff. I could understand that. We didn't apologize, we just both said that we were assholes, We all had a shitty period, and a shitty day, and we won't react to situations like this in the future. Bye. - When will this end? - Soon. Thank you for listening, Csilla will be here with you tomorrow. So please prepare accordingly, and come to literature class. - Is that your mom? - Yes. Nice. The saddest part is not that I don't have a boyfriend, nor that I don't celebrate Valentine's Day. But this is the only time when my mom thinks about me. I will call her. - To wish her Happy Valentine's Day? - No. I'm calling her, because, my friend was just released from... - Psychiatry? - Psychiatry. And my mom also has very serious mental issues, I want to introduce her to my mom, to show her, that's what you'll become at 40 if you keep taking drugs. Why, your mom takes-- I wanted to ask if you'll be home tomorrow? Wait, is tomorrow Thursday? Okay... I want to introduce you to a friend. Would you talk to her? She was addicted to medications and to drugs, they are about to release her from the psychiatry, and I would like you to talk to her. This way, you can also talk about how you feel. Ok, I'll talk to her. Ok, bye, ciao. At this point, I felt that I had even more questions. I felt it was time to finally sit down and talk. Let's see how it goes. Is the LED light enough? Can we check? Yeah, but you have to go outside and turn it on. Can I ask you to clap once? I'm going to put on my moisturizer because my face is dry. In my opinion... ...from the three of us, I have the easiest personality. - Go ahead, you can ask me. - No-no-no. - Carry on. - But ask me. - No, just keep going. - Ask me. - No, really, ask me. - Alright, I'll ask. 1. CHILDHOOD Could you tell me about your childhood? How were you born? - What I remember or what they told? - What they told you. I was always a really bad sleeper. I could hardly sleep. To this day, I sleep badly. I cannot sleep when I have to. Only when I'm not supposed to. The problem with my childhood is that it was only good when I was really small. Until I was eight years old. Then it was horrible. That's when I felt that... My mom was probably- or was pregnant. And... For a long time, she told me that she was a dancer abroad. At first she said that she worked at a bar. First, as a waitress, then she became a dancer. Then I figured out it wasn't exactly like that. And... She said that she was still in Germany but when here she found out that she was pregnant, then it was too late to abort me. I think she had an abortion. Before me, one or two. My oldest brother was 18, and Nándi was about 15, and I was 12. So... We were only teenagers and they didn't come home. For a long time. Either my mom was missing, or my father was gone for days. And do you remember when they told you that it's over? They never did. Suddenly... When we moved away, my dad just wasn't there. My real dad came to the hospital and saw me. And then he said to mom... that he's sure I'm not his, because I don't look like him. Who says that? Newborn babies don't look like anyone. You look like an alien. And how did you react to that situation? Not well. I started to live a life of vice. 2. TEENAGE YEARS Well, yeah, it wasn't the best way to deal with that. When I was 13, I started to smoke cigarettes and weed. And then I did everything else that came my way. And then... Me and two of my friends, we bought a bottle of vodka. We drank it. Then I came home, ran to my room, brushed my teeth three times, took a shower, disinfected everything. And then... I didn't dare to talk to my parents I was worried they'd smell the alcohol. This happened, when I was around 13. It was... I think that was my biggest secret back then. It was rough. Then I realized how good vodka is. Vodka is good. She had no influence over me. When she came to my room, and saw me rolling a joint at 7 am, and I get high instead of going to school, she only said, "Go to school." "Okay." Mentally, it started by going nuts. In my case, that meant... I had panic attacks and I couldn't distinguish reality from fantasy. I had to drink early in the morning, in order to survive commuting, and everything else around me. For more than six months, it became a regular habit, that I was cutting my arm. It didn't occure to me that I should do it vertically. One day I came home from school and said, "Fuck it, I'm going to kill myself." I know it was very late, and I had a lot to drink. So, I took my-- By the way I still have my blade somewhere. There is a chance it's here somewhere. I'll check that later, I keep some shit around. I keep a lot of shit around. I was in school. It was a grammar class. It was boring as hell, and I went outside to smoke with two of my classmates, and then I got back, I was high, and suddenly, I had this feeling... It was really intense. I went pale and began to tremble. I had horrible thoughts in my head, and I even thought, "I'm going to die, now I'm going to die. My heart is going to stop." I had no idea what my blood pressure was. "I'm pale. How can people see me like this?" And... ...on that grammar class, I decided, that from today, I won't take any kind of drugs. And since then, did you have any drugs or alcohol? Well, the only time-- Once I had a bit of orange juice in which my friend had put her remaining vodka. I made myself vomit. But no. No, no, no. 3. ADULTHOOD I either want to complete a yoga instructor course, or learn to be able to work in a nursery. Once I have one of these, I want to go abroad. I can't go abroad with only a high school diploma. It's just not enough for anything. Then, later, gradually... When I won't have to take care of my children and my company. Then, I'd want to go back to study physics-- and that's when I'll get a degree in astronomy. Why do I need a high school diploma? You even need it for any training after high school. Two: my mother doesn't have a high school diploma. And... She started a vocational high-school but she didn't even finish. And besides not having a diploma, she doesn't even have her report card, 'cause to this fucking day, she never went to pick it up. Why do you have to testify in her favor? Because they are getting a divorce, and if the judge summons me to-- I'm supposed to testify in her favor... ...about... My stepfather claims that she is unfit to raise children, because she wanted to kill herself. And... She... Her method of making me testify that she's not suicidal, is by saying that she'll kill herself if I don't do this. This is so irrational. Yeah. You are so much more mature than me. Yes, because you are 26 and you don't have children. How fucking dare you? Aren't you ashamed of being at the bottom of society? You are not a fucking man. And I'm making a film about twenty year old girls. After this conversation, a memory came back. It was summer. I just turned 13, I listened to a punk band called 'Alvin és a Mókusok' all the time. My secret Playboy collection was getting bigger, and I finally got a girlfriend. As far as I can remember, I was happy. Then one day I got a text message. "You are immature. Let's break up." So, since then, I'm trying to grow up. But somehow, I just couldn't. Still, the girls didn't have a choice. They had to. - Máté doesn't care about us anymore. - I finally had ice cream! Fuck it, Máté, you don't care about us! Yes, that's true, you don't give a shit about us! The weather is getting warmer, and your dick's getting harder, so he forgot about us. Please kiss each other! - That would be a good scene. - Why don't you two kiss? That would be a good scene in the film, but she doesn't like fat girls. - Look Tina, there is a rasta guy. - Where? Look Tina, there is your boyfriend. Everyone will always think that Máté is your boyfriend. Why? They do think that. My parents were sure that I'm dating Máté. I was really pissed. My mom thought the same. She said, "Are you sleeping at Máté's place?" - No way! - What? The hardest thing is that my parents happen to know my type. And Máté is exactly the opposite. Two days after we met Máté, Szani asked me if I liked him. "It totally looks like you do." Come on! Just because he has dreadlocks? - No, it's because-- - No, because Tina was like this: - What? - You were shy in front of the camera. The first time, yes. It was really weird. SZANI: This class is so boring. TINA: I can't believe I'm here. MÁTÉ: Which class? TINA: English. EMESE: It's only boring because they're not paying attention... TINA: Give it a rest. So... There is a girl, whom I've been... I've been dating her for a while. Nothing happened between us yet. And I'm not sure if anything will happen. You say, "I don't follow politics." But you'll be very surprised, when you don't get treated in a hospital. Fuck. Everybody should go fuck themselves. This is pretty sick. I can't even understand, just how... Why do they sell this as a liquid eyeshadow? This is just so good. Hey Máté! It's April 8th. Soon I'm going to vote. I'm just waiting for Kata to get her dreadlocks done. It's quite exciting. - Is Szani going to vote? - I don't know. She is working. Having a night shift is not an excuse for not going to vote. Or she might not know where to go, but I looked it up for her. You looked it up for her? She can't be that stupid. Can she? Szani is not stupid, she just doesn't like to invest energy in things. How come you are going to vote in the end? - Because you convinced me. - Me? - I didn't say a fucking word. - Bullshit! You didn't want to look like a lazy bum in the film. No, I didn't want to hear from everyone that, "Oh, your mouth is so big when you say you want things to change, but you couldn't even go to vote." Which is right, don't you think? Yes, but I honestly don't give a shit. I didn't bring a pen. I should have fucking brought one. If they say that I should have gone to another place, based on my permanent address, then everyone can blow me and I'm not voting. I don't know where I have to go. Good afternoon. Okay, Emese, sign it here. Why couldn't they put this shit on the internet? I'm sure they are playing with me. And you know why? I'm going to vote anyway, 'cause they do this on purpose, so that you don't go to vote. They give you shitty information, so you go to the wrong place and end up not giving a fuck about this. But you are not gonna fuck me over, Mr. President! My feet hurt in these fucking shoes. Why do you wear them for work if they hurt your feet? Because I look good. I'm worried about making something stupid... I'm going to vote. I'm at the wrong fucking place again. Can you fucking believe this? First, I have to be at work in half an hour. Second, I won't make it. Second, by the time I'd get to the voting place, it'd be too late to vote anyway. So, everyone can suck my dick. I'm going to explode. Next week I'm going five times too. All my nails are broken. I look like a homeless bitch. And I'm so tired. I want to throw myself on the floor. I want to throw everything on the floor. I hate everyone. They know I need that paper to get my fucking high school diploma, though I just don't give a fuck. Fuck. They can't teach us anything that's important in life. They just teach us crap like, this fucking... what is the logarithm, with this cocksucking square root with billions of numbers, or... what happened 15 years of billion. 15 billion-- 15 billion years ago. Or what? 15 billion... Anyway, so... What happened in our history a long-ass fucking time ago. I just can't give two fucks about how cavemen threw their own shit at each other. School never teaches you how to fill out a check, or how to open up a bank account. No. Because... They think your parents will teach you. But what if you don't have any parents? Or they don't know how either? What is this video about you? "Hangovers", or "Paying a visit to your family while being hangover"? Assimilating to the family. Right. Good job. Yeah, I feel something like that. You can't sleep here. You know that, right? - I don't want to. - Yeah, I can see that. I don't want to. I'm going to work at a new place tomorrow. Where? Association of suicidal people. In parenthesis: - I'm looking after small children. - Yes. Go on, tell us more. - That's what I'm going to do. - But where? - At Savoya Park at an adventure park. - Oh dear. Basically, Happy Mother's Day. I wish you... I just couldn't do more so that you... - What? What do you want me to study? - No, it's nothing like that. What kind of school are you sending me to? I can see it... Oh my god. - I have never had a massage. - Then they'll torture you hard. - Tina dear. - We're not drinking now. Hello darling. - Yes? - You work well with your hands. We have already talked about this hairdressing thing. You can do that your whole life. You can do it forever. So, I think... You can still think later... You can cut hair, and then you can think about what else you want to do. - Because, I think, that-- - Cheers! - I don't know what you feel. - That I don't want to. I want to work with kids. - But nobody accepts that. - I accept it, but... - But? - I don't know. We can accept it, but... - But the thing is that I just don't know. - With kids? It's a huge responsibility. - Are they big kids or small kids? - Yeah. It's a big responsibility. And they're small kids. Hello! I just wanted to say it doesn't matter what they think, I won't fucking give up my life, my goals and my dreams. It's just... No matter how hard they try to go against me or my goals, I'm not going to give up what I got in my head. I don't care if it ruins relationships. I mean my own relationships, because, I'm motivated by this. When I see that everything is collapsing, that's when I pull myself together and I push myself forward. That's when I have the greatest faith. And the greatest hope. It's just great. I would be so happy if something happened. It's 11 pm or 11:30 pm. Something like that. I still have to study physics. Now I will do a spring inspired make-up. Oh god... I've been dreaming the same three things for days. I had a muscle cramp here. It just hurts like hell. In my first dream, my nail falls down. The second is that I fall in love. That's usually pretty awful. When my nail comes off it's bad, but when I fall in love it's way worse. I can't remember the third one, but I always feel the same way when I wake up. I want to put everything on my face. I will have to do a peeling after this. I feel so bad. People are so disgusting. I don't want to be near them. I haven't seen people for five days. Except for my family. I didn't have to go near them, or to interact, or handle them. I didn't go to school because I went to sleep really fucking late. And I woke up at night a bunch of times. I can't explain how good this feels. I'm so fucking tired and I can't sleep. I don't want to take a sleeping pill. His eyes are open. Do you like yourself? Igor? He must hate me. I'm so sad, but I don't know why. My head started to hurt. I had a migraine. I don't know what my problem is. I don't feel well. By the way I started thinking about... ...taking my antidepressant again. Now... I'm not exactly sure about... what is going on inside me now. I just want to run away. That's all. On this day Emese had a conversation with her mentor. Later, she told me that she decided not to do the physics final exam. She will stay another year in school. TINA: What did you talk about with Angi today? EMESE: We talked about my final exam. That I'll do the physics final exam next year. TINA: Ooo, but that's good, right? EMESE: I don't know. I might have more chance this way Don't you feel bad about not finishing school with the girls? I'm not sure that Szani will finish this year. I told her so many times that she is not stupid. She could learn anything and she has an understanding of things. And she has aptitude, she has a good logical sense, and... Anyway, she just quells all this inside, and she works so much, that she doesn't have time to study, and on every exam... I've never seen her not cheating on an exam. Oh fuck, I overslept, you didn't wake me. I must go to work. How can you live like this? Sleeping only one hour kills me. Dunno. You get used to it. It was hard for me too at the beginning. At the beginning I could only do three days in a row. Now I can do six. And I'm also doing my exams at the same time. You can get used to anything. I could even do a seventh day, because then you pass your limits. Once, with a workmate of mine... Cobra and I we agreed on working for a whole month, without any days off. To see how much money we would make. We could make so much fucking money. Maybe I shouldn't do this before my final exams, but it would be fun to do it. I'm going to work. Again. And I just fucking hate being sick. For sure. As long as... I just realized that compared to the others, I really do curse a lot, so I must stop this. I'm trying to curse less now. Not now, but in general. I can't say anything else in these videos, other than, that I'm fucking tired, I work too fucking much, and I'm fucking fed up. Oh, shit... Again. I just said I won't curse that much, and every second word I say is a swearword. Fuck... If I were a man, and I would like a girl like me, I mean, I'm pretty, so why not? Maybe it's a bit exaggerated, but I guess I am pretty. So why wouldn't a man want me? But if he keeps hearing me say things like, "Fuck, I hate my life, I'm smoking this motherfucking cigarette. Cocksucking... So, it's repugnant. I'm starting to realize why I don't have a boyfriend. I want to change these things, besides having such big fucking arms. So, this too. And my belly too... I'm going to work because I'm fucking late. That word again. Fuck me! I can't believe this. At least now I notice it. And then at last, the day of the final exams arrived. When you have completed the exam, then... You have to sign two things before you leave. Pay attention, because if you don't sign them then there'll be trouble. First, is the record of the high school exam. You sign that you turned in the tests with the date and time of submission. That's one. I can see you, great. The second one is that you listened to what I just said. Then, the exams went down just as quickly as they came. Without any hype. It was good to see the girls' relief. But we still had to wait for the results. I'm at work right now, I slept OK, but I woke up with a terrible migraine. I'm going to a party on Friday. I talked to my mom, to go over and cook. It was she who invited me. My godmother told me off, that I should pay them a visit besides "being so busy" to spend time with my family. Guys! Last call in ten minutes. Are you ready? I don't have to do the oral exam in math! Because I've passed! There are very few schools where the examinees know along with the teachers, just how much a high school diploma's actually worth. This is a very important step, and you must take it. All of you. And you are going to do this. If you can't do it this year, then you will do it next time. Congratulations to the ones who succeeded. And now, the diplomas. Dóra Eszter Bakonyi. Tünde Tordai. Al Shami Mohamed Noor. - Alexandra Magdali. - Yeah! We love you Alexandra! Finally! - My god, it's fucking over! - God, it's so great! I can't explain how I feel right now. I won't have to go to another motherfucking school ever again. By the way I'm so fucking drunk. So, Máté, this is indescribable. It's here and it's not bad. And.. This is for all my schools that expelled me, I did it, so blow me! I'd go to all of them, to show this to them. And it's not even suck, bitches! Actually, how are they? That's it. So... So, I can't imagine myself not being successful, but I can imagine myself being unhappy. I will have a small apartment and I will lock myself in with a shitload of books and I will study and read until I go insane. This seems like a perfect plan. I'm sure that my dad, or at least, that's my impression, that my dad has really high hopes for me, that in his life, I will be the the most successful person. I don't know where I will hide if don't make it. That's all. Kisses. I thought the filming would be over soon. That our journey together stopped here. But I was wrong. TINA: Listen Máté. MÁTÉ: Shoot. TINA: Can I tell you something? You gotta keep it to yourself. MÁTÉ: Of course. TINA: It's important that you know. Szani will also tell you. Just don't contact her now. So Her mother committed suicide today. SZANI: Hey Máté I'm moving tomorrow. You can come over if you want to film it. MÁTÉ: I'm coming of course. So, I always thought that the red one was her favourite gummy bear, because her favourite color was red. But it was because the red tastes the best. Do you think that all gummy bears taste the same? Fuck no. My favourite is the green and the white. It's crazy just how much stuff one can hoard. You know what we should play? This way, you can also be in the film. The camera is there, you show me the clothes and I'll tell if we keep or donate. Alright, I'm in. I have never fucking worn this. Oh, yes once. How the fuck could I put it away like this? Check this out. - It's totally elegant. - Beautiful. This is a low neckline blouse, I love it, and wore it a lot. I'm too fat to wear it now, but I wore it during the winter, because it's warm. Let's keep it, I'll wear it. It doesn't look nice. For the first time in my life, I bought something online. I wanted a low-neck bodysuit, but this is fucking huge. It fits a woman who is a size 52. She wore this skirt. My godmother at my grandmother's funeral, or it's my great grandmother's. I might wear this at my mother's funeral. It won't fit me. Size 34... Anyway, I'll keep it. - You want me to put it aside? - There. A miniskirt. It's quite tasteless. - I wanted to wear this today. - Really? - Do you want some Csibi cream? - What's that? It's a handmade cream from Transylvania. Made from handpicked herbs, they give them to a company. But it's not a big company, it's just a couple of locals, they make these creams by hand. It's a face cream made from lard, beeswax, marigold and peppermint. - It fucking rules, and it's made locally. - Awesome. Toss it. And how're you doing now? Did I read you her suicide note? A few weeks after her death it turned out that she left a suicide note behind. And she just wrote such things in there... It was all about self-pity. How sorry she feels for everything. She apologizes to everyone, and that it's all her fault, how she fucked up everybody's life. Then she wishes a happy future for everybody. She even writes that my siblings get well and become healthy. She hopes that her boyfriend can forgive her and become happy. She even writes to her boyfriend's brother... She hopes that her boyfriend's brother can overcome his weed addiction, and can live a happy life without that. And she didn't write a single word about me. Not even a fucking sentence. Not even a "fuck you". Not even something like, "I have a daughter, "I have a big daughter, Alexandra." Nothing. She mentions my two siblings by name, but she doesn't even say that she has three kids. Not even a fucking sentence. What I would change is that she called me so many times to go over to cook outdoors, or to cook... ...because she's making my favorite food and I should go over... Or she called me in the middle of the day, saying that, "Surprise: I'm making your favorite, would you come over? "You can take some with you or eat here with us." She is never going to cook my favourite food again. And I don't fucking know the recipe. And I didn't visit her the last time either. And it wasn't because of the food she just wanted to do something nice for me. No... I don't know... I met three random girls and I was so drunk that I told them this story. They just sat there and listened with their eyes wide open. You know, they didn't say "Poor Szani" 'cause they didn't know me. Nothing like that. They didn't want to give me any advice. They just listened. They didn't know anything about me besides that. Just that a random girl's mom died and she wanted to share it. So yeah... I learned a magic trick. I hope I can do it. I might fuck it up. Two aces. A heart and a spade. I see that. - Did you do magic tricks as a kid? - No. Watch this. I'll fuck it up. - I saw you put it back. - Fuck. But still, it's cool, right? I'm too slow. My hands are sticky. - But still, it's cool. - It's a good trick. You should prepare yourself for the scene where you're walking in a bikini. Not a chance. I already told Szani that she will be a MILF in 10 years. A real MILF, who fights you on the street. I'm sure Tina will do what she imagined for herself. She will be a yoga teacher for kids. You have to know about Szani that she's very dedicated to her work. It's amazing how she does it- and it's okay! I mean it's crazy how drunk she can get while she works. I think Emese in ten years, will be either single... ...or... ...or she won't be alive. That's what she wishes so many times. It's something like that: a turtle on a finger board. I'm sure the three of us will meet in the future, because, I mean, it's just so fucking cool that there is a film about us. Yours as well, brother! It's the best! - He said it to me! - I know. He was a dickhead. Oh, god... - So are you tired? - How can a fucking nobody yell at you? Who the fuck does he think he is? They said something to Emese but I defended her! - What? - "Your hair is cool." Both of you holding onto me now? That's just so-- This is too much. I'm the tallest, I should be in the middle. Right, and we hug you! In the end, I did follow three teenage girls for months. But it felt different than in the beginning. Now, I knew that the girl on the left is Tina. I'd be happy to leave my kid with her to learn yoga. That's Emese on the right, who I hope will soon accept that she is already special enough. And that's Szani in the middle, who is the strongest person I know. As I had become a part of their lives, I had grown up a little bit more. If that's possible. For Pali - What's that mean? - That was Spanish. But I'm Dutch. - Fuck, you are filming. - Fucking filmmaker. You're a bitch!
