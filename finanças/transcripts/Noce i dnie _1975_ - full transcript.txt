Dedicated to Jerzy Kawalerowicz. Christ! A photograph of Bogumił hanged on the wall. I packed children's photos at the last minute but I forgot about him. Even now, I forgot about him. Oh, merciful God! If only the course of history could stop in its tracks and save Bogumił's photograph. Madam Barbara! Madam! The town hall's on fire! Everything's on fire! Let's run! I've paid for a hackney! Pack, immediately! Quick! Quick! Let's run! Madam Barbara! Quick! Quick! Or we won't make it! Madam! Let's run! We're going to burn! NIGHTS AND DAYS Today's a day of blood and glory Let it be a resurrection day Gazing at Poland's star The white eagle launched into the sky Heartened by hope He's calling us from up above Uprise, Poland, break your chains Today's the day of victory or death Poles, take up your bayonets Let freedom and let Poland live Let this rallying cry Ring out to our foes Ring out to our foes Let drums snare and cannons blast Go on children, array in line Freedom and glory lead the regiments Triumph shines on sword bayonets Fly, our eagle, way up high Serve the glory, Poland, and the world He who survives shall be free He who has died already is Poles, take up your bayonets Let freedom and let Poland live Let this rallying cry Ring out to our foes Ring out to our foes Józef, sir! - After the galop, the quadrille. - Mazur first, madam! You promised me, sir! Daniel, after your wedding we'll wed Terenia to her dear Kociełło! - And then... - And then we'll wed Basia. - Yes. - I've been eyeing a bachelor for her! - Who likes what, Teresa? - Water lilies! Bogumił, is it your own good and free will to take Barbara to be your wife? It is. Barbara, is it your own good and free will to take Bogumił to be your husband? It is. I don't love him, Terenia! It's impossible to love a man, who... Dear Teresa! Terenia, is it possible? Is it possible to love only one man your whole life? I don't know, I never truly loved. What about Lucjan? Lie down. Have some rest. Have some rest. Apparently, in Kaliniec they say I'm engaged. Belie these rumours, please! When push comes to shove, I'll say: no! I'll say: no. And it'll be done with! Lucjan! Wake up, for God's sake! Look what my sister is doing! She gave up tailoring and started tutoring in arithmetic! - Well, what do you say? - Good! She's back to her old ways. You go back to your bachelor ways too often as well. I'm warning you that... It might not end well! - Don't you threaten me! - People start shunning us. Stop threatening me! And please, leave me alone! Barbara won't come to Kaliniec for the summer. She'll spend it in Borek. At Ładas' estate. Miss Barbara, everything's provided for at Jan Łada's! At Łada's hustle, bustle, drinks, and dance are a must! Ensemble! Jan Łada provides for everything! At Łada's hustle, bustle, dance... Who's... Who's this young lady over there, in this colourful dress? Come, I'll introduce you to her. No, no. Perhaps later. There's no "later" at Jan Łada's. I'll introduce you! But why make a fuss? Right this instance! - Miss Barbara! - Excuse me. May I introduce you to our hero. Mister Bogumił Niechcic. I, Barbara... take you, Bogumił... to be my lawfully wedded husband. I vow love... faith... and fidelity. And that... I won't leave you... until death do us part. - Long live Mr. Toliboski! - Bravo, sir! Just imagine, Basia, this Toliboski got married to a plain-looking but rich girl. One Narecka. They wed in Warsaw. The newlyweds are going to live in Borowno, the bride's dowry, a few miles from Kaliniec. Hush, hush! Do they have to saw away like that all the time? My head's splitting from these screeches! Don't make a fuss, Jan. They need to warm up and tune up. Couldn't they do it at home? Why is everyone looking at me like that? Ah, they're gazing at Niechcic. Anyone can see his shortcomings. Insufficient education... and his boorishness. No, Mr. Niechcic looks quite well in his new outfit. I'm surprised that such a young, handsome man didn't pursue a richer and prettier girl. If I back away now... nobody will ever want to marry me. Shoo! Shoo! Go away, you ugly thing! - Good morning. - Good morning. Don't mind us. I just wanted to show my fiancée around. What's there to look at? You'll live long enough in this manure! Upstairs, children, off you go! What are you gawking at? Off you go! Whose children are those? Oh, them! Former estate manager's. One Winczewski. And that was his wife. They're leaving Krępa and we'll inherit their place. The entire house, madam. I'll show you the rooms, if you please. Large, nice, bright. No, no! Not necessarily today. Another time, when the occasion arises. - Some other time, sir. - It looks awful now. But we'll refurbish it all. I don't have to see it today. I know it doesn't make the best first impression. - Once we renovate it... - Honestly, I really like it here... I like this... Krępa. You'll get the hang of everything. Give yourself some time. Cheep, cheep! Cheep, cheep, chickens! I'll teach you. Chickens need different care than ducks. Cheep, cheep! Or guinea-hen. One other thing is... checking for eggs. - Like this! - I know, dear Ludwika. I know that already. - How's the work going? - It's rough, sir! - Potatoes are rotting! - We can't work like that! I'm clueless, Walenty. The barometer is rising, but look! Everything will rot away if it the rain doesn't stop. Careful or you'll bump your head! You ought to keep lots of poultry. And pigs! Pigs give the best returns. What happened? We won't get Winczewskis' house any time soon. They have to stay another few months in Krępa. I'm sorry I misled you. I've promised you riches, but... But I really like it here! Bogumił! Bogumił! - What happened? - Why are they always howling? - What's wrong? - I think I'll die in labour. Take me to Kaliniec, even tomorrow! I want to see mom and Teresa before it happens. Calm down! They're howling like all country dogs. Oh, Christ! No, Barbara. You and your husband won't leave us alone. No, I really feel quite sick. I'd rather go back to Krępa. Bogumił! To go back on such a day, Barbara! We've organised everything! Barbara, I can't sit idly at home. I don't neglect my piano and I keep a purebred puppy. We have no children, but I cultivate our abode. Bravo, the both of you mesdames! Hereby, all our teams are ready to start. Bravo! And that's my whole life, Basia. Michasia keeps making some shady deals. Lodgings, lotteries, buying and selling houses. And what's that for? Daniel, you forget yourself. Why would Basia care for our affairs? What's that for if she's never there for me? Bravo, the winning team! Bravo, the winners! It'd be in bad taste not to mention on this festive day two extraordinary women who contributed to the organization of today's festivities. I'm talking about two devoted wives! Could I not shine like they do? After all, Stefcia and Michalina didn't even finish school. They've acquired good manners by socializing with the right crowd. Until recently, Michasia thought Darwin was a city. You shouldn't stay in the country. - You can't be land stewards forever. - That's right. There's only one way for the country people - the town. Only there one can still achieve something. In trade, industry, or government! There are plenty of posts to go around. You just need some verve to make a fortune. We'll find a post for Mr. Bogumił right away. There's no future ahead of us. No life, as long as we keep mouldering in Krępa. Oh, lie down, Basia. We'll be home tomorrow. We'll only scrape along there, for ever. Do you know who we are to them? Land stewards! I've been regarded as worse. See how they live here? Holszańska and Michasia. How they operate? If we moved to town I could finally achieve something in this life. That's right. I knew that if you settle here, you'd want to leave me. Who says I want to leave you? You do. Only those who want to leave come up with ideas such as these. Stop bullying me, will you? I'm quite unhappy already. Unhappy, why? It's 'cause I'm ill. Can't you see that? Oh, Christ. Why aren't you asleep yet? About Holszańska and Michasia... I'll show them! I'll show them all! And asleep again. Always asleep! - What's happened, Basia? - Nothing, I came to pick you up. Unbelievable, really? My dearest! She came to pick me up! Look, I've already carted 40 wagons today. Follow me, I'll show you something! See? Look how plentiful oat is this year! Look, it's pure gold! Pelting down into our hands! You really came to pick me up? I can't believe it! If I paid them by the morgen, would they finish up harvesting faster? How come you didn't get an education? I thought your family considered such things important. Indeed, that's true. I didn't get a proper education. Well, for nine years I wandered foreign lands among people with no tomorrow, like myself. When I finally left this swamp, I came back here only for a little while. I used to think that something would drag me back into the void. Only after I met you I regained hope... that there's still a chance for me. That I can become a man. I don't know where I got this audacity from but I felt that something was bothering you too. And that it'll be easier to bear our burdens together. I didn't want to inquire about them. I was sure that you'd overcome them by my side. And that by your side I can achieve something. Like what? I'm not sure, but I know that if I have you I can do something of service for the people. I thank the fate that marrying without love has given me this man. How fortunate that I've never told him I hadn't loved him. Step aside, people! We're carrying injured children! Make room, people! PIOTR NIECHCIC, DIED AGED 4 Basia, when you were ill, when I thought that I was going to lose you, I made a vow that if God spares you, we will leave this place. Maybe the change of surroundings would make you reflourish. I wrote to Teresa, in secret. I asked her to have a look for something of interest. A reply arrived today. Terenia writes that a mile from Kaliniec there's an estate to be managed on land stewards' own terms. Mr. Daleniecki, Mrs. Mioduska's plenipotentiary, resides there temporarily, and wants to sign the contract right away. The estate is called Serbinów. And what do you think? Well, I'd miss Krępa. When die has been cast I got anxious. I must be growing old. We can't bide our time forever, and we might not get another chance ever again. But can we abandon the land where momma, uncle Klemens, and Piotruś lie? Piotruś is neither where he lies, nor anywhere else. Oh, Christ! There's never been a mud like that in Krępa. And you agreed to take it under these conditions! We've only just broken even, and we're back living hand to mouth. Don't say that! Think what it'll look like when we make it flourish. We're up to the task. But in Krępa, whenever you look there are fields, woods, meadows. And here? Darkness, mud, and ponds all around! - You complained about everything there. - Never the views! Then come with me into fields and meadows, open spaces like you've never seen in Krępa! - And the soil, come and see! - I don't care for walks any more. Until the Lalicki's are here, I simply give up. I can't move out from here, sir! They've rescinded the offer from another estate. And I don't want to be a burden to my family. Nothing will blossom on these meadows, sir. No one will uproot the couch grass weeds out of this soil. You'll end up leaving the estate the same as me! No one will make ends meet here! No one, sir! Old cloth, turkey feet, chicken feet, I'm buying! Old cloth... Whoa! Good day, Mr. and Mrs. Niechcic! My name's Szymszel. Szymszel from Kurza. And this Szymszel can sense that Serbinów will need a wet-nurse soon! And Szymszel will bring her! - One or two? - But we don't have children. Is it so difficult to have them? When people love each other, they need to have some! When good fortune will blossom in Serbinów and when you, the heir of Niechcic, will repair the holes in the roof and parget this porch. And when you, madam, will landscape a flower bed in this mud, and plant flowers all around, then Szymszel sees children here, growing up well! They'll be nothing but nice and sweet! Must've been a cloudburst, sir! - I don't know. - Come on, hurry up! What can I... now... Patching up won't do the trick, Mr. Olczak! We need new roof linings! These are rotten and worm-eaten. Move all the grain to outbuilding, coops, and the manor. For God's sake! It's going to flood the entire house. Stables, barns, pigsties, garners - all flooding! We have to put the winnowing machine in the moulded room. Faster! Hasten the work, men! Make sure to shoe my horse well! Oh, Banasiak! Go to the field over there, behind the meadows. And don't wear the horses out! Everything is falling apart. I'll manage to weed out the couch grass, Basia. - It needs a few years of hard work. - Well, of course... For now, we need to invest, and not to worry about the returns. I won't write to Daleniecki. He recently complained that previous stewards wanted nothing but money. We need to make small deposits out of our funds. - Where will you get the money from? - A loan. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! We'll go bankrupt. Go to sleep, my little girl. Sleep, my birdie. Sleep my little child It's time for you to sleep I shall rock in your cradle Until your eyelids close I shall rock in your cradle Until your eyelids close Why aren't you asleep? Is it not enough that I'm not? Don't smoke that often, it may cause you harm. What does it matter... What does it all matter? What do you mean? This world! Our sleepless nights. The others, and in the end, ourselves. We are born, and then we die. The world goes on as if were never here. - Honourable sir... - What do you want? Honourable sir... there's someone to see you, sir. - What is it? - My name is Roman Katelba. I was sent here by the honourable Mr. Daleniecki. Ah, so you are the Katelba! As you can see, we're harvesting! - Mr. Olczak, back to work! - End of break! Get to work! The harvest's right on time! I tend to praise the day only after sunset, Mr. Katelba. Yes! I like Peszke's winery, indeed. And to play cards, as well! I prefer seizing the day to scouring high societies, bending over backwards before the governor, like our friends do! And don't try to tell me that it was me who ruined our marriage! You and your ridiculous spectacle! "I don't need your money, I'll make my own living!" Are you surprised? When you reverted to bachelor ways, I knew you wouldn't sacrifice your way of life for the family. - Then, I started teaching. - That hurt me the most. And for that, I'll never forgive you! What's happened, Terenia? - Nothing. - My dearest! It's just that... I'm growing old and I'm losing my nerve. I thought I'd see you sickly and frumpy but you look wonderful! Wonderful! Spend the evening with us, Basia. I've just come to visit you and they say you're leaving again. I am... Yes. I'm leaving. I'm taking the girls to Lithuania for the summer. You know, I'd like to hide somewhere in the country. To entomb myself in a hole where nobody can see me. I'll come and visit you in Serbinów tomorrow or the day after, alright? Alright, fine. Basia, what's the matter? You looked at me like Piotruś used to. He also brushed back his hair like that. Incredible... I noticed for the first time that he is... I mean, was similar to you. To you and to Bogumił. Why go to Lithuania, visit us for the summer. You promised you'd come and stay longer. No, I can't. I have to go to Lithuania. Oh, Krępa... This is where it all begun. What has begun? What... in Krępa? What has begun in Krępa? - I need to go back. - Why so suddenly, Terenia? There's something wrong with me. I want to see the children. Bogunio, I beg of you, get the horses ready and send me off. A lot has changed in my life. I used to think even small things, like laddering, won't happen to me. Laddering? Yes, you know, like in a pantihose. I trusted life too much and this has been my doom. Oh, Bogumił! See, I forgot about flowers for you. It's good that Bogumił took care of it. - But you'll suffocate in this smell. - No, I'll leave the window open! Visit us on Sunday, you really need to, Basia! - Bye! - Bye. Thank you, bye. Godspeed! - We had a lovely time, didn't we? - I'm not talking to you. What have I done to you, Basia? You made a fool out of me! You inundate her with flowers and expect me not to react? I just ordered some boughs to be cut. I've done it with our other guests. Not true! I've always picked flowers for our guests. It's not about flowers, anyway! You can give them to anyone you want! Just tell me how Teresa knew exactly who to thank for these flowers? It looks like there's something between you two! - Just think about what you're saying! - Do you love her? Me? I don't love Teresa! But is it so strange that I'm happy to see her? Or, even, to think about her? Nothing will come of it! Nothing more will come of it! By the way, I'm happy that at least once in my lifetime you're jealous of me! - I'm not jealous! - You are. I am not jealous of you, you don't understand! You are, which means that you love me. Fine, I'm jealous! But if you think this is proof of love, you're wrong! Then know that the one I love could do anything, shower anyone with flowers and I'd forgive it all for a mere smile! I'm not jealous! It's not about you or what you feel! I can't have anyone tell me again that a man left me for someone else! Yes... Now it's all clear. Bogumił! You've never loved me. I knew it all along. And I heard about that man even before we got engaged. The Ładas told me. It was easier to think that it was just daydreaming. You've said you didn't love anyone, and I believed you like a brat... I didn't say that to hurt you. I've never loved anyone apart from... Apart from? You. Come back. Just to make it even more difficult later? Terenia, the girls are with me in Serbinów. Would you like me to bring them here? If I die... If I die then in the dresser... Basia! No! Not in the dresser, no. If... I forgot. If I die, Basia... - Basia, if I die... - But you're better now, aren't you? - You're better now. - In the dresser. The doctor said you can drink buttermilk and fresh cream. Basia, if I... I'll go to Serbinów for fresh buttermilk... In the dresser, Basia... I'm moving out to Częstochowa. I'm building a great cement mill! I'm sick of this indolence. Drinking with my mates until dawn at Peszke's... Small and shady trade deals... It's good for ladies such as Michalina. Doctors prohibit me from drinking. Fools! They say something's not right inside. But I'll outlive them all! I'm certain I'll succeed. I believe Terenia will help me. So you believe in the afterlife? Reason tells me there's no such thing but I can't help... to wonder that death... that the dead... I believe Terenia will help me! Because none of you know... what losing her has meant to me. Yes. I should go now. A few weeks before her trip abroad, Terenia... packed all her letters here. She asked to give them to you in case she dies. I kindly ask you, Tadzio, to return me the letters. I've been writing to you over the years. These letters must disappear together with the memory of our fateful, though beautiful rendezvous. I'm culpable when it comes to you, Lucjan, and the children. But this is a matter between me and God. Terenia, look! A skylark. Just look what the rain and hail have done to my crops. How can I harvest it? That's young Krępski, the land owner's son. Came back from a sanatorium a few days ago. Isn't he beautiful? There's nothing special about him. Good day. I'm so tired that... I just dream of lying down and sleeping like a log. You don't like me any more? Don't want me? No, my goodness, I like you, but you see... I am so busy with the house, children, and the rest... It'll change, really. I'll change, just be patient. I beg of you. Be patient. I'm doing well, uncle Joachim! Both daughters are growing in health and I have a son now! A son! Well, daughters are good too, indeed... but a son will always have more opportunities in the world. Look, Joachim, what a beautiful grandson I have! Why the long face, Lucjan? You're not drinking. I've been observing you for a while. I've emptied many wine barrels in my life. Enough already. - How's business? - Great. Going well. But I... don't feel well. I have to pace myself. It's exhausting. Laugh it off! You look great, you'll live to be a hundred. Whoopee! At least I feel needed here. I should've visited you before, silly me! It's so nice here, so at ease. I now see that I was born to live in the country. And someone's always at home. Not like at Michalina's. It's always empty and boarded up there. A girl grazed a goose Grazed the goose, grazed From dawn till dusk the goose - Józefka! Józefka! - What now? Józefka, give me your hand, and take me home. I'm out of breath. Indeed, I don't want to do anything else but serve old hags! Should I take you filth out next? Scram, right now! Outta here! Pay her what's due get her out of my sight! - I'll take her home. - Unbelievable! What beautiful times they were! I was so young, pretty... And I was adored by... It doesn't matter. My favourite thing to do was to read old romances. We'd climb up to the attic so that nobody could find us. One day, when it was dark, I tripped over a step. And lost a couple of teeth! I really like this room. - Do you know why? - No. It reminds me of my childhood. All your rooms always smelled like lavender. - And like wax! - It was such a long time ago, Basia... Bogumił. Perhaps we could sing something? - Like what? - "Go, brothers, grab your sabres." Go, brothers, grab your sabres Today we shall live We will show that Sarmatians Can still live as free We will show that Sarmatians Can still live as free Blessed Poland was asleep The white eagle slept so long But it awoke and remembered That it too was free once Before they take the body some family are bound to arrive. And after the funeral we should host a dinner. We ought to give orders in the kitchen. If you're so detached and indifferent that you can think of guests and banquets... Take care of it, then! To me, death is too awful a thing to care about this nonsense. It's an excuse to gobble up and drink, anyway! Wait! Where are the children? Tomaszek is playing in the servants' room and the girls are by the deceased, I took them to see how they're dressing nana. I asked them to pick some flowers. Let them learn, so they know how to dress us when we die. Dear God! You're dragging children into this? And in such a manner! You've all become peasants, boors! All your family is in the Serbinów mud! You have no feelings, no heart! None of you! I remember my mother, she was an intelligent woman and her company was irreplaceable! I'm dying from grief that this life is gone! It's obliterated, and you're bothering me with dinner for some guests! Christ, why one has to say such horrible things... just to calm down? - Here, on the pillow. - Basia, look! - And take some from Tomasz. - Look, a letter I got today from Paris. From Daleniecki? His letters bore me. It's from Daleniecki but... Please, read it! Dearest Bogumił, I received your transfer. - The one for next year's beets. - Children, go! I am astonished and delighted. Delighted... Well, not because of the amount... Not because of the amount but because of the rich harvest. When we gave you the fallow that Serbinów was 11 years ago... - It's been 11 years... - Yes. You've put Serbinów in exemplary order. No other estate in the area can compare. Sure, when one doesn't eat for the first two years, just weeds out couch grass, then it's no wonder... Why are you so embittered and angry? You're still so young. My God, and so pretty! The two of us will never reach an agreement. Let's part ways and go back to our duties. Szymszel! Szymszel arrived! - Welcome, madam! - Good morning. I brought you a guest. Whoa! Hłasko. Hłasko's my name! - Sorry, I can't see anything. - Here they are! - Now I can see where I am! - Kids, wait! I have something for you. I recognise you from a photograph. Mrs. Niechcic, is it? - I brought presents. From your brother. - You know him? Engineer Julian Ostrzeński. I'm travelling from Petersburg. God, I haven't seen him in 20 years. Please, come in! Julian is a kind soul, madam. For him, there's nothing outside the club! They say he even sleeps there. But he used to build railways. That was long ago. Now he likes his food and drink, plays pool, and attends operetta and gypsy shows. Gypsy romances are his favourites. A vile city in a country where everything demeans and debases. He's a good man. This club's his family. I don't wish such a family upon anyone. And upon myself such a brother. Is it a wonder, madam. Was our father any different? Nothing but food, drink, antics and debauchery! Are we any better? Daniel's already a lost man. And Tomaszek? Nothing will come of him. The family's getting weirder by the day. In general, Poles are going to the pot. I've been a teacher for 20 years, madam. I spent the last 8 years in Petersburg's Polish home. Maybe someone around here needs a teacher for children? What a happy coincidence, we need one. Don't we, Basia? Well, you yourself said that you won't leave for Kaliniec unless by some miracle we find the right teacher. Here's your miracle! Tomaszek! Off the horse! Homework done? No classes yesterday, Mrs. Hłasko lost her glasses. No, she didn't. You hid them! Stupid, coarse pranks! Get off the horse! Mrs. Hłasko is blind as a bat without them! - Emilia hid them. - Stop lying. You did it! Spare me the lies, at least! - Who let you ride? - Papa. Papa! Walk over there! - Bogumił! - Give me the pliers. Is it true that you let Tomaszek ride the horse? - I didn't. - Don't lie! We've asked you, Mr. Klimecki, to keep the child off the horse. I can't keep looking after master Tomasz. He doesn't even ask, just takes it out by himself so that no one could notice. Stop spinning tales, Mr. Klimecki! A horse isn't a needle. You can see it. You keep telling me fibs all the time! If you see Tomasz take the horse again, I authorise you, Mr. Klimecki, to whip his rump. A couple of times, so he remembers! Don't you encourage strangers to whip my child! I've got enough to worry about! Jesus Christ! You fall asleep so fast. Agnieszka has the shivers again! No fever, I checked. Hands and head are cool. She's been running around all day. If it's not a cold, then what? Maybe she's skittish, you yelled at her today. Agnieszka is never skittish. She takes after you in that regard. I think she's just growing up. Or maybe it's malaria, hence the shivers. I wouldn't be surprised. Everyone's constantly aching here. So maybe it's malaria, then. I'm telling you, it's neither. She's got some nerve disorder. It might develop over time. The school starts soon. How can one go to school, be amongst people, with such shivers? - Are they gone now? - Yes. - Is she asleep? - She is. Perhaps she's insane? Our children must've inherited some bad blood. What? God knows what grandpa Laurenty brought home from France. Good God, Basia, do you hear yourself? But uncle Klemens went undeniably mad. What about our deceased mamma's sclerosis? And nan had melancholy! Once, she wanted to jump into the well, take her life. There you have it, asleep again! I can't even talk with you! Leave your door open, at least! You're always shutting it. Here we go again! It's you who keeps shutting yourself off. Does Emilia have pouchy eyes again? No, they just seem so. In the spring, children always go a bit pale, madam. They ought to drink cod-liver oil in winter. How can you neglect them so much as not to give them the oil? Summer will help them more than anything! I see this Katelba isn't very helpful, is he? I'm just beginning to set everything in motion. You'll wear yourself out, and what for? So that you can fill Daleniecki's and Mioduska's coffers? It's not about them! You'd deprive yourself and take away your children's food to send them more. My dearest... They'll die. We'll pass away too. But the land will stay. And that's why we have to do everything properly there. It's all I care for! But I care about the rest! If you must serve, at least serve something great. For me working on the land is great. In it, I see something worthy of servitude. I serve it! You don't serve the land. You serve Daleniecki. No! You must pace yourself. We're growing old. To us, life and health are not worth much, but our children will need us for many years to come. A catastrophe fell upon us! - What's happened? - All hay is lost! - Look at yourself. Get back! - There's no way it stops! - Get back, for Christ's sake! - Dear God! Everything will rot. The hay is lost! So... let's dump it all and leave this damned place! Let's run where the universe takes us and stop worrying whether it's raining or not! The children have to go to school with other people. Because they'll have to live among them! Domestic teachers are bygones of the olden times. But only Agniesia can go to school, Tomaszek and Emilka are too young. And even if we sent her off to a boarding school, we'd need to pay for one child in town and home-school the rest. How are we going to afford that? We need to get used to rising costs. But where will we get the money from? Can't you see we're facing a disaster? I'll move with them to town. Me alone. They'll go to kindergarten, we won't need a teacher. You want to leave me? Because if you leave for town, you'll never come back. What nonsense goes through your mind! I'll come back to you... wherever you are. I'll come back but you can't blame me for longing after town life. I don't like the other street that much. The walls are hot. - Here in town, life is bustling! - Be careful, Basia! - Where shall I park, madam? - Park over there, round the corner. I'll go ahead and pick up my overcoat from Nussen's. Be careful when crossing the road. Alright, we will. - Mr. Klimecki! Where's madam? - Over here, by the shop. Basia! Agniesia! They have fine overcoats there, perfect for Agniesia. You're so capricious when you shop, really. I don't know if I should've bought this overcoat. Wait for me here! - What have you done? - I've bought you a brooch! But I don't wear brooches! I'll go back and return it, then. It's a bit awkward. Should I ask for my money back or shall I get this ring for Agnieszka? I've got enough to worry about without my child playing with jewellery! I'll be right back, I need to get some balm for the horse. Come, Agniesia. Good day to you, Mr. and Mrs. Niechcic. Take it! Honourable greetings to the Niechcic family! Mr. Daleniecki wants to sell Serbinów behind Mr. Niechcic's back. - How come? - Mr. Daleniecki has his man here. And this man is, pitifully... - Out of the way! - Aside! Make way! Watch out! Giddy up! Giddy up! I have a valid contract for 4 years. I'm not afraid. Don't people like Daleniecki only care about their own interests? - Still, I'm not in fear! - Alright, then. In fear or not, with or without a spy, Daleniecki can always sell Serbinów. Don't slouch! I'm stifling again. I'm suffocating. Everything's a blur. Bogumił! I'm stifling. Oh, Jesus! - Which one? - Give it to me, sir. Please, hold it. I feel terrible. What's this, valerian? I asked you repeatedly not to give it to me! - What's happened to mamma? - Kids, leave mamma alone, she's ill. Felicja, please take the children out. Shoo, go on! Don't worry, I'm feeling better. Where's Agniesia? Maybe she's ill now? - I'll send for Dr. Wettler. - Don't you even dare! We may lose our house, and you want to waste money on him? Do you want me to have another heart attack and drop dead? But... It's so stuffy and dark in here! I'll wear them out, wake the children up. - Basia, take this. - I keep thinking... I can't! - I keep thinking I'm going to die! - Please, take this. - Doctor... - Awful! And please stop bewailing. Oh, Jesus! Calm down, please. Everything will turn out well. - Klimecki will be back with drugs soon. - Give me a cigarette. No, it can't be a heart disease. I think it's the stomach pressing on the heart. I've always thought stomach is my main affliction. You heard the doctor. You must remain calm. - You're safe. - He knows his truth, I know mine. What will the children become if I die? - Don't raise them to be boors. - Oh, stop it. I won't. So you do believe I'm going to die. Tell me what Wettler said to you. Confess! What did he tell you? He said it's me who's going to die if you keep nagging me! Counsellor Joachim your family's elder. I think you should go to his funeral. Am I mad to go on such a journey? I can't leave children alone for so long. What journey? If you go through Małocin it'll be no more than seven miles. - Nine, not seven. - As usual, you know better! I do. Uncle Joachim was at nan Ostrzeńska's funeral. It's because he used to like wandering about. All men like it, right? Then I shall go. You're all worth one another. He's dead and you're arguing like fools. You like wandering too. We're never out in the world. We could socialise, at least. What world? We don't belong with the land owners. And thank God, they're all useless. All worthy people are dead or sent to hard labour. Anyway, I don't even know... Which world do we belong to. Be careful on your way to Zborów. - There's a faulty bridge... - I know. Sit here, or you'll get cold. - I won't. - You will, you will! Tomasz, off you go! Move back. Don't lose a wheel on the way! - Godspeed. Shoo, quick. - Bye-bye! - Careful around those pits in Małocin! - Alright. There are awful bumps on the road there! They've found Joachim's will in the desk. It says in black and white that part of the inheritance is to be given to poverty-stricken relatives who deserve a better fate. - Well, how about that. - So, you too inherited something. - Who? - You. - Me? - Yes. In the name of Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. Have you gone mad? You're telling me now? I couldn't believe it myself! It's stated clearly: For Jadwiga and Adam Ostrzeński's children, eighteen thousand roubles in equal shares. So you'll get six thousand. Christ... You think they won't question his will? Of course, they will! And that'll be it. They'll find problems, precedents, tangle it up so that even the devil won't untie it. Don't even bother. Such benevolence is only worthy of despise! What if it turns out that it's been forged? They'll sue us, what then? It's best to relinquish the will and forget about it. I'm pleading and warning you. You're right, Basia. If they pay up, that's good. And if they don't, we won't die of hunger. Six thousand roubles... Though the formalities will be long and arduous. What difficulty, darling? I don't see any. Michasia will be all over this inheritance. My dear... Difficulties? She's going to make sure everything works like a charm, you'll see. Daleniecki can sell Serbinów now. Cheers! My God... God, this money is like manna from heaven. Go on, drink up! If we buy a house in Kaliniec, then only by the statue on the Main Square. The well there has good drinking water. I am glad, Basia, that you'll have your own money. Six thousand roubles! I'm old. I can't provide for you any more. You know, sometimes I think that... I started a family too late in life. Nonsense! Your looks haven't changed since the day I met you. Drink up! You've always been the same! Six thousand roubles... Bogumił, help me get undressed, please. So... what are we going to do with all this money? For once in my life, I'd like to see a bit of the world and go to Krakow. And if not, then where to? Maybe with children to Ciechocinek, to cure their cough. And so they don't always have swollen tonsils. Six thousand roubles... I'd like to meliorate the land. Plant some fruit trees, make an asparagus bed. It might all be ours one day. I have pre-emption right for Serbinów. It'd be best to buy a house in Kaliniec. Otherwise, how would we pay for lodging when all our children go to school? Once I have a house in Kaliniec, I'll live with the children. You'll bring me country goods. I'll care for the home and kids. I grew a bit tired, I think I need to lie down. Bogumił! - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Nothing at all? - No. Are you sure? Are you sure? But... Don't worry about anything. It might do you harm. Have you had heart trouble since last time? No. I'm all right. I feel well. Now Daleniecki can sell Serbinów whenever he wants. You know what? Actually, I don't feel that well. But tell me, do I ever feel well? Each evening, I can barely walk. It's because you don't love me. Hence all these worries and illnesses. It's because of what? Am I to blame that I'm not... that I've never been your type? How are you going to cope when me and the children move to Kaliniec? I'll manage, Basia. Bogumił, we've been so happy together, haven't we? Why won't you say anything? Bogumił, talk to me! If I knew you'd be so good to me before you leave... I'd like you to leave every day. Watch the door so it won't open, the handle's loose. Yes, sir. Shall I make you something to eat, sir? It's going to be so sad now that the lady and children are gone. Felicja! Felicja! I'm coming! Yes? - Did you close the shutters? - I did. Good morning. Good morning, dearest neighbour! Please, take a seat next to me. Why are you alone? I have become a grass widower, Mr. Woynarowski. My wife and children ended up in Kaliniec. After much deliberation, I decided it's what's best for the children. Come to us to play bridge tomorrow, then. My youngest daughter's visiting now. She's as good a player as I'm a maiden, but we'll play with grandpa. I'd happy to. If time allows, I'll be glad to come. Mr. Bogumił Niechcic, my daughter, Ksawunia. Holy Mother of God, you've brought so many things! Like for a wedding! I thought I won't find you home, that you'd have gone to a party or a confectionery. - Are the children outside in this rain? - I don't know. Tomaszek and Agniesia are out all day, every day. Tomaszek could use a man's hand. A father's hand. I can't get a grip on those two on my own. You're better off here, Basia. In Serbinów, there's already black autumn, mud. Mud's not a problem if you have good wellingtons. So what that there's mud? It can do me no harm. Obviously. But you're not here all alone? Don't you meet with people? You're not alone, are you? I am... I'm alone, as usual. I don't care much for seeing anyone. Especially when I think of poor Lucjan. Do you know doctors suspect he has cancer? Yes, right. Indeed. I'd even go out sometimes, but one needs to dress up... Lock up the doors, not like in the country... Put a scarf over one's head... and only then, go out. I understand, Basia. I do. Kids only really love us in Serbinów. We might as well not exist outside it, me at least. How can they possibly love us if we don't love each other? What do you mean? You've always said you love me. I do... I do... I just wanted to see if the bed is made properly. Good night. Mr. Woynarowski asked for you to come to Pamiętów tonight. Aleksander, their lackey, was here yesterday. It's too late to go now, I guess. I won't go there ever again. Staying up, late-night dinners... It's not for people who have to get up before dawn. Oh, I thought I'd never see you again! Father's not home, he's gone. Hold on. Let's talk in peace. Alright. Why are you following me, sir? We can keep our distance while we talk. Don't worry, I'll get out of your sight. What? Why do you indulge in such nonsense? - I used to poison myself. - When? In Warsaw. I've met this man there... He used to say: You're a tragic woman. Later, it turned out that it was all a bet. And that's when I poisoned myself. My father saved me. If you're about to leave, then please, do it immediately. My dear child... What can I possibly offer you? A new, even worse anguish? I know these winter evenings, when you're all alone here, aren't pleasant. But Christmas is almost here. I'll come for an entire fortnight. If I were you, I'd go to Pamiętów. Woynarowski is a very nice man. I go there from time to time. We sometimes play bridge. Most often, we just end up talking. Talking you say... I only dream I could talk with someone at times. - Leave your wife. - I can't. Why? We need to keep our lives separate, you and I. - Do you love your wife so much? - I don't know. I don't know... It's always "I don't know" with you. I'm at the end of my life, yours just begins. Nothing but madness can keep us together. A madness... that I'll bless and you'll curse and regret later on. Over there! Agniesia, look, the first star! Mamma! The first star's already in the sky! Let the supper begin, then. When Christ is born And into the world he comes The dark night is wading In stellate brightness The angels are rejoicing And out into the heavens they sing Gloria, gloria, gloria, in excelsis Deo I know you love me! - And your wife doesn't! - Let's not part ways in anger. - Leave immediately! - Now? Right this instance! - What about the departure? - Out of my sight! Miss Woynarowska is strange, indeed. One could think that she's trying to seduce you. Shame, we could've accompanied to the station together. I didn't know I'd upset you. I would've told you. Woynarowski asked me to see her off. Why are you gazing at me like that? I'm wondering, Basia, about the strength and good sense required... to settle one's debts with life. It seems like you're wondering what's happened. No! You just look a bit tired, overworked. - I'm worn out. - You have to rest. No, I don't need rest. I must reflect upon myself and the world. I'm buying an estate. A few morgens of soil. Cultivating a garden. Building a house. You're entombing yourself. You call that a bliss? I didn't get to where I wanted in life. I'm starting all over. - Are you staying for long? - Unfortunately, I'm leaving today. But you'll come to see me once I've built it, will you? Remember, you've made a promise. It's really important to me. I need to talk to you. Staring death in the face. This is the only fact that everyone must gather their wit's about and confront. You can neither buy your way out nor cop out of it. I used to wonder whether the moment when a man's body... truly resigns itself to death, is even possible. It is, actually. Because when everything hurts, you just want it to stop. And once you know, like I do, that nothing can provide you with any relief... then you simply want to stop existing. After Teresa's death... you, and you alone, remained dear to my heart. When I was left alone in this world, I ran away from you, Barbara. You didn't even know. I thought you were happy. Because if you weren't happy... But... You are happy, aren't you? You're happy... Am I right? - Yes. - Are you happy? Happy... Give me this scythe! You'd only sharpen it! Get to work, men! Get going! Get working, Kałużna! Bogumił! Bogumił! Daleniecki's coming! - When? - I'm sure he want to sell us off! Any news, Roman? Everything's fine, honourable sir. And about this buyer, the one you wanted me to inquire about, one has to tread carefully. Otherwise, everything will come out. These damned Jews, they'll sniff out anything! This sale is done with. I won't sell Serbinów. And if I will, I speak to Mr. Niechcic first. Mr. Niechcic is a buyer himself now. Buying what? He inherited money and bought a place in Kaliniec's square. - Why am I finding out about this now? - It's a recent thing. I hope you have a plan on what to do with the inheritance. It's for my family... Especially since it's my wife's money. So you want to abandon Serbinów in favor of your own land? And here I was, intending to... increase your share of profits and give you another five-year contract! How... how could I possibly leave Serbinów? I became attached to every lump of dirt. The trees I planted are blossoming now! Sir, I've seen this wasteland become fertile. If you improve our contract, I'll be much obliged. Caro mio! You yourself know best what you deserve! In a year or two even our youngest will go to school. You'll see, they'll be diligent. You won't have any trouble with them. Until they start falling in love, running wild. Falling in love? God forbid! Life's full of nights and days. Some Sundays as well. Only not as often as the calendar says. This time, it seems as if a Sunday is within our reach. When I started stewarding Serbinów 15 years ago, I found here nothing but ashes, ruins, empty barns, empty pigsties. Empty stables! It's just unbelievable that you've been here for 15 years. - Oh, Michasia! - How time flies! Agniesia, come here! You've graduated with distinction. - Which grade? - Year four, auntie. Bravo! Bravo! And I claim that nothing grand will threaten Europe ever again. Revolutions, wars? Perhaps somewhere in Asia or Africa. We shall look upon these events from a historical or at least geographical distance. But does a war or revolution need to happen for the world to keep spinning? Please, sit down. Here you are. Peaceful times, when everyone ploughs their own furrow, are also historical! Children, calm down. You'll see, one day someone will write a history of these peaceful, assiduous times. Well, I cleared the field, the weather's beautiful, I host guests in my humble abode. I'll be sowing soon. So maybe, in a small way, I'm making history as well! Michasia, are you sure you'd left this money at our place? It's nothing, a diddly, no big deal. Three half-roubles wrapped up in a babushka. A gentlewoman with money in a headscarf! Do I have to sit with the dog again? Can't we put it on the yoke? - Daniel! - Bodzio, into the carriage! Please visit us again, you're cordially invited to come. - Janusz, get in! - Au revoir. - Visit us on Sundays! - As often as you can! - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, mamma, it's been great. - Good night, my girl. Basia! - Yes? - Have you seen Tomaszek? Tomaszek? I'll look for him and find out. Just don't get angry, I'm begging you. You'll find out? You're scared of your own children! I'll either raise you to be a good man, or I'll whip you into line! Who? Who let you do it? Who allowed you to take someone else's money? - Who let you take what's not yours? - Bogumił! Christ, you'll kill him! He confessed! What do you always want from him? Out of my sight! Both of you! You bandit, you! Off you go! Off you go! I know, son, that you didn't do it for yourself. You didn't take it for yourself. You wanted to buy candy for the boys. Come on, let's apologise to your father. We'll apologise to your father and on Sunday we'll go see auntie. But mamma will tell them that I found this money only after they'd left? Son... Son, my heart breaks for you. You're good. You have to be good. Where are our pouches? It's pouring down our heads in workers' quarters! What's the reason for this gathering? We have a request, honourable sir, - We'd like to talk about rewards... - Rewards? Did you not get your due on time? Who are you holding a grudge against? I'm living in the worst room in the quarters. The whole ceiling has slumped due to mould. The pigsties are in bad condition. The roofs, though fixed before, leak onto our noddles. The living quarters' floors are gone. Where they aren't, they're rotted out. You yourself know that I've recently inspected the cottages with Olczak and I know best where they need fixing. But I'm not self-governing. And you don't need to remind me about the quarters. I remember. I remember about the living quarters without anyone's injunction! During my childhood... I was schooled in French but then I forgot it all. And you know, Felicja, that I couldn't even remember a tune that Miss Woynarowska used to keep singing. Si tu m'aimes... What does that mean? "Ah, if only you loved me." But then, miss helped you understand, sir. - Understand what? - Well, the song. When a man reaches a certain age, he ought to understand that a young, pretty girl can't find him attractive. Well! Her heart's still young and wants to get out into the world. It strives for joy it haven't experienced before. But maybe it's worth to lose oneself, to live... these couple of weeks like you want to remember them for the rest of your life. Are you sure that the man you met at aunt Michalina's was Józef Toliboski? Of course, mamma. Mr. Józef Toliboski from Borowno. He knows you from the olden days. He'll visit you tomorrow afternoon. I said you'd be glad to see him. Mr. Toliboski? Paying me a visit? What... What's gone to his head? Fine, let him visit. We'll talk about the olden days. We haven't seen each other for 25 years. Have I said something wrong? - What does he look like? - Very pleasant. - He's got a long beard. - A black one? No, a grizzled one. Of course. He must've grown older as well. - Have I never told you about him? - No. - Mamma! - A gathering by the town hall! - A demonstration! - Yes! We're going to Serbinów! Julia! We're packing our things, we're going back to Serbinów! What about Toliboski? It's been twenty years, he can wait. Pack Tomaszek's things! Basia! Basia! Please, stop! Basia! Basia, let me... - We're here just for the Sunday... - I'll explain everything. Basia, don't do this to me. Can you hear me? Basia, can you hear me? Please, stay! Basia! Don't mind me. I know that when I was ill, Żarnecka died. Why did you hide this from me? Wettler forbade you to get riled up. Poor old woman. She thought she was needed, irreplaceable... that she was unique. Our whole lives go by like that. And vanishes without a trace. With or without us, nights and days go by imperturbable. Why make any effort at all? Why do we make any effort, why do we care so much about our lives? That Saturday, when I came here, I was supposed to meet a man. And I didn't do it. I came running to you. I've never thought that you cared about me in that regard. This aspect of life has been meaningless you. For quite a while, at least... You ran away because you'd been scared of yourself. It was not because I'd been scared. It was not out of fear. I love you, Basia. I don't think my love for you could be any greater. Even though you've been with me... more out of fear than for any other reason. God, how your hair's gone grey. So what about this Felicja? Mikołajczyk's son, the widower, wants to marry her. Bogumił! Bogumił! Bogumił! Basia, what's happened? Oh, Christ! I've had a dream about Lucjan. Tell me, why fight death and disease? To keep carrying the burden of life? Such horrible thoughts to have on a wedding day. The wedding... Go get the children. They're surely dancing and breaking out in a sweat. It's time to get back. - Bogumilł! - Papa! Agnieszka has graduated with distinction! - Daddy. - My dearest daughter! My joy! Thank you! Come, I'll show you something. I'm building new quarters for the workers, see? I'm in a hurry, I don't want Daleniecki to prohibit this. Really, with a distinction? Agnieszka, tell me, do you really want to attend university? Yes, papa, to study nature. In Lausanne, Switzerland. But will this nature secure a better future, my child? People like us, without any assets, have to keep that in mind. Oh, I think everything will be fine, papa. Don't you worry. - My fellows! - Śniadowski hasn't finished yet... Be quiet, please! There comes a time... when Polish independence will of international importance! A European war is hanging by a thread. It'll start, if not today, then soon enough. When that happens, our disregarded cry for independence, forgotten by everyone, is again going to become an asset in the game for Europe's future! And that's why today, from this Swiss soil we're raising a request: Poland, after a hundred years of slavery, must once again become a free, sovereign country! So this one letter from Paris, from Miss Woynarowska, has suddenly changed everything? Ruined what's been between us for so many months? Agniesia, my feelings haven't changed. I've considered this matter long closed. Miss Woynarowska... Ksawunia! That's how my parents used to call her. When I was 14, I used to see her at our family home in Serbinów. I fell for her a little bit. I felicitate you on your choice. She's beautiful. She's a poor soul. Unhappy, I'd say. She was here for four years. Changed departments, never graduated. Then, she left for Paris and... I'm simply scared for her! She's unstable. Then chase after her. Don't let her suffer. - I won't go to Paris. - Why? I want to be left alone. Mamma, I'm discovering Serbinów anew. I'm looking for the meaning of life in hard work. Oh, mamma, it's so good to work until your muscles sore. So in the evening you fall asleep and don't overthink it all. Good morning, mamma! Good morning, Agnieszka! What about Emilka? Christ, what's happened to Emilka? All's well. Emilka's at school. They've let us out early because the headmaster got a message that his mother's ill. More importantly, I'm in the fifth grade now! There you go! But your teacher wrote that you won't pass this year. No! I managed to get my grades up. I'll only have one fail. I'll pass that subject after the summer. - What about your report card? - Report card? What do you mean? Should I have carried it home, so it'd get crumpled up or dirty? Anyway, report cards aren't ready. Not all teachers have graded us yet. I asked them to send my report card through Józefat. Whose hat is this? Ah, this silly thing... I borrowed 5 roubles from a friend to buy it. I thought if I pass, you'll forgive me. I don't condone such excess! For a panama hat, 5 roubles is a bargain! I don't know what to do, this friend wants his money back now. Papa, please, indulge me this one last time. I'll give you 5 roubles. Here you are. Send it back to your friend. I'll double that if you bring your report card home. Good day to you, madam. I brought Mr. Tomaszek's stuff from the town. Ostrzeński's servant, Antoniowa, asked for Mr. Tomasz to send back this hat of Mr. Bodzio's that he took. - What hat? - The one he took! I mean, borrowed... Panama hat, or something. You don't have to shout like that, Jozefat. Who taught you to take things? From other people's houses, without their permission? - Answer, or I'll whip you like a dog! - Papa, I didn't know... Oh, deary me! I won't do it again! Bogumił, for God's sake, you'll kill him! Christ! That's all we need, for you to call him a thief! - No, papa! Stop! - Bogumił! Get out of my house, you! I'll show you papa, you'll regret it! Bogumił! He'll take his own life! If he's to live as a scoundrel, then he's better off dead! Tomaszek! Tomaszek! - Tomaszek! - Tomaszek! I couldn't find him anywhere! Anywhere! - Where's your father? - In his room. Well, of course! And he doesn't care that his child might be dead in a ditch! He used to say he'd kill himself if we kept berating him! Has it never occurred to you that something may happen to me too? Don't even scare me with that. I see you keep brooding without end! What's the matter with you? - What? - Mamma, I'm in love with this man... and he loves me too, but we won't be able to marry. He's an idealist. He has no space in his life for personal happiness. So you're in love with an idealist? And he loves you too? That's a miracle! A miracle that I've longed for all my life, in vain. Do you even understand what that entails? If they tell him to drop a bomb, he will. He'll sacrifice himself. No, mamma. Please, don't tell anyone about it. Even father. I... got over it, we parted ways. My dear daughter, do you want to be as unhappy as your mother? Mamma... get changed, you're soaking wet. Where have you been? Where have you been all... - Where have you been all night? - He was up on a tree. You rascal! How could you keep us in the dark, you... He'll be good from now on. Good and wise. You made up with father? My son! I know you're a good person. Good and wise. And now, let's drink like Mr. Kałużny! Drink up. Cheers! A quarter of liquor for honourable sirs, only hard! First show me the money, Kałużny! - Kałużny, sir! - I'm paying! Tomaszek, go home! Home, at once! What's the meaning of this? Tomaszek! - Tomaszek! - Kałużny, leave him! I'm not saying that you bring shame onto us... but how are you not ashamed of these people! What do you want from me again? Everyone drinks on weddings. And they don't reproach me! They like me better than any one of you here! If you're there... God, if you're there, if you redeem, then deliver this child from evil. God, if you condemn for an eternity, then condemn me, for I am guilty. God, don't save me any pain, any fear. Save this child for me. Save his lost soul for me. You have something I've never seen in my life. Wherever I turn, I see and hear you. Oh, to see you soon, or this instance! Papa, he loves me! He needs me... He calls for me! I must go to Lausanne, immediately! He loves you, you say? A man who hasn't even bothered to inform us of his intentions? - Not even ask! - But he can't come here! He's an exile! When you were fast asleep, he fought, he was in prison. Fought for what, exactly? What you once fought for in an uprising that now you condemn. I don't condemn it! I don't condemn it. But I've seen that you loved the work, you alone. I thought that once you graduate, you might retrain for agriculture. Perhaps... one day I'll manage to buy some land to secure your... Poland needs other work than planting potatoes now! Or serving the rich just to get by! I don't serve the rich! I serve the land. It's not my land... But I haven't drunk or gambled mine away! I serve the land... And again, two years of our life have slipped up on us, my daughter. Soon, we'll finish the harvest, and start potato-lifting. Doctors tell me to stay in bed but don't listen to them. This time, the barometer didn't let us down! Oh, yes! - God bless! - God bless you. - Back to work! I've sent carts for rye. - How many? - Four. - Is that enough? Miss Ksawunia has come back from abroad. Apparently, she went through an unhappy love affair there. Now, she's married to one Ostrzeński from Siąszyce. She birthed twins. I'm happy, my daughter, that you came to stay for longer. A letter from Agnieszka! In the autumn, she'll visit the country again. I decided to drain Serbinów. I'd built new quarters, so now's the right time. I'm off to Kaliniec tomorrow. I'll go Kaliniec and contact Baścik's irrigation office. - What do you say? - Do as you please. I don't like this Baścik fella. He must have a polyp in his nose. His mug's always open. Still no reply from Daleniecki? He used to write back quickly. Why the rush? He might deny your request over the cost and it'll be your fault. What do you mean, deny? I'd like to see him try. In that case, I'd give up Serbinów. Let him find a replacement. It's the first time, Basia, I wasn't able to secure the funds. I've been hoodwinked three times! The trader promised to provide the cash for crops. Either he provides it in a week or I'll stop trading with him. What should I do, Basia? I must pay Baścik the deposit tomorrow. I gave him my word. Why go around and beg? If they don't want to lend, fine. We have ours in the bank. You'll pay Baścik and get it back in two weeks. You're not afraid to risk our money? I don't want you to hinder on the drains. What sort of a risk is that anyway, my dear! Papa! A letter came from Mr. Daleniecki. - It's on the table. - From Paris? Yes! What's happened? Bogunio, what's the matter? Daleniecki has sold off Serbinów. I cordially inform you that Serbinów is sold. Mr. Owrucki and I have already signed a preliminary agreement. Signed... It's stated clearly: "All investment expenses over 3 thousand roubles can be made only with the knowledge and approval of the owner." It's written in point three as one of the terms. And you've spent a huge amount on draining that requires a mortgage! No one needed this! What do you mean, no one needed this? I don't use French perfume. I stink of dung because I work in it! And I alone know what this land needs! You forget that I decide what's good here. Me and the contract. A second, unwritten contract between us allowed me to act freely! Oh, but you've abused this freedom, Mr. Niechcic. Would you kindly suggest how you're going to pay the nine thousand? Because I can't see how! I tore this 9 thousand away from my wife and children. I risked everything we ever had for the sake of this land. I'd risked it and lost it because you trade people's fate behind their backs! We only served a man like him to win our daily bread. Good manners, clever noddle... and a boor underneath. Good man or not, he owns Serbinów. And to me, Serbinów is much more than daily bread. I... cannot imagine living anywhere else. Bogumił, stop it, what are you saying? Life is everywhere. That's what you always used to say. We'll keep on living. We have to live. My dear Mr. Bogumił, as you know, I've been parcelling Pamiętów for quite some time now. Cutting it, tearing it into pieces! And today, when we heard the news of the wickedness of this perfumed bastard from Paris, Ksawunia and I thought that we could offer you a mansion, a garden, and the rest of Pamiętów to acquire. It's about three drags of land in total. I don't want much because I know whose hands I'm giving it into. Twenty thousand roubles. You pay by cash as much as you can. As for the rest... Ksawunia, being the heiress of Pamiętów, agrees to split it into as many instalments as you need. Oleśka! - I thought you won't make it. - Where's Tomaszek? Follow me to the furnace. Give me a harlot for the jack, let her get it! A son of such a father! A son of such a father, with gamblers! Mamma, you're here? Yes, mamma is here! What are you glaring at? Go home, at once! - I haven't done anything! Leave me be. - Right, you've never done anything! Then why cause a stir? I'm not doing anything? I'm here on an internship! - His father owns quarries. - I've just seen this internship. Then go and find out for yourself! I start office work tomorrow. The office? From tomorrow? If you want work, work by the furnace! I see, so you want me to be a mere worker when I can get a good position in the office? I don't care who you become! Do you understand? Serbinów has been sold. - Let's go together! - I'll just go get my case. Let's go together! You don't believe me again, do you? None of you do! We'll see who lies and who's telling the truth! Where are you going, son? Son, wait! My dear son! Wait! Why did you come after me? I won't go back anyway. The devil has possessed you, son! It'll pass! It'll pass! Stop nagging, I'm unhappy enough as it is! Let's go back, son! I just want to tell you, I'm beside myself out of grief. It was such a long time and now you have to leave it behind. It's not fair! My Kałużna... Serbinów will last without us too. Bogunio, please, tell the ones on the carts - to ride slowly over potholes. - I've already told them that, Basia. Take this barometer, it'll be safest in your cart. Walenty! And then order, Walenty, this hay and mud... Papa, I've already packed! I'm so glad that we're finally leaving Serbinów! Giddy up! Giddy up! Basia, I'll stay here for the night. There are a few affairs to sort out. Giddy up! What's wrong, Bogunio? I don't know. I'm puzzled why I don't have the energy I used to have. After all, Basia, we've got our own place at last. We found good people, who didn't let us suffer and helped us stay afloat. Well... I must be getting old. Or I've lost the habit of stewarding my land and I have to get used to it again. You know, I'll go outside to map out the spring work schedule. Bogunio, take your coat! God almighty, you've been outside for so long... At your age... Bogumił, take it off. What's wrong? - It's nothing. - My God, you're burning up with fever! There's something in my chest. Give me some water, it burns... Jesus Christ, why did you put on this coat... I... must... go into the fields. Holy Mother of God, it's 40 degrees. Don't be alarmed by the fever, madam. He's unconscious. But it's not that bad. Must... go... into the fields... His condition is serious, therefore we cannot ignore it. But it's not life-threatening. - The left lung... - Pneumonia? You must stay calm, dear madam. You must keep a cool head. His heart is a bit worn-out but strong. We'll give him some camphor. This manor is more spacious than Serbinów. The scenery is also nicer. And what of Woynarowski? He's become a townie in his old age. This man has a broken watch instead of a heart in his chest and is still alive. As far as I know, he should have died 20 years ago. - Basia! Basia! - Yes, Bogunio? - Yes, my love? - Basia. Drink up. Am I ill? Yes, but you're better now. Drink this medicine. Medicine? Was there a doctor here? A doctor? Yes and he said everything is going to be alright. Bitter. I've caused you so much trouble... The expense... Don't be angry with me. I won't let them auction me off. I won't let them... I won't, I won't let them auction me off. I cannot hide it, madam, that the left lung's started festering. His condition isn't hopeless but it's serious. Tomaszek... Tomaszek... Stay at school. Stay at school, my boy. My daughter... Sweetie, where is Agnieszka? She's coming, papa. I'm sure of it. The festering process is advancing. Be brave, dear madam. Mamma... Papa is asking for you. Basia... Basia... Yes, Bogunio? Yes, my love? Did Tomaszek give back the money? What money? Ah... he did. He did. My dear child, my... my son. Basia, I'm dying. Bogumił, don't you leave me. Don't you leave me on my own. - Agnieszka? - Mamma! - My dear child! - My dear mamma! My girl... I haven't heard... I haven't heard you come in. - What's going on? - Just some guests. Tomaszek and Emilka invited some friends over. - But we're in mourning, how could they? - Can young people be in mourning? I don't even blame them. Emilka has always been unhappy that everyone is throwing parties except from us. Let her, it's only for the summer after all. Mamma, when I come back from England, I'll take you to Warsaw. - We'll live there together. - No, I must stay here. I must keep an eye on things, or they'll waste his work in a year, all of them. Me too. Don't tell your siblings. They're so happy to be able to live the way they want at last. They should enjoy life. Oh, mamma... Emilka and that young Bartołd are getting married on Easter. They've told me recently that they won't live in Pamiętów. "I'd prefer leasing any property to owning such land." That's what I heard from my future son-in-law. So I've decided to sell Pamiętów. And I wrote to the Marcins to ask for their permission. This is the reply. I consider this grange yours. Please, manage it as you wish, mamma. The necessary documents will be sent immediately. Pamiętów is dear to us only because of father but his memory lives on and wherever we go, we'll take it with us. So, as you can see, Mr. Ludwik, Pamiętów must be sold. Yesterday I went for a walk in the park and it was as if Bogumił was with me. It's better. It's better that you don't consider him gone. Gone? I told him to take his winter coat the last time he went out to the fields. If he had taken his light coat, he wouldn't have got overheated and ill. - He'd still be alive. - Special edition! Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated in Sarajevo! Special edition! You know what, Julka? This quiet life in town doesn't agree with me. I must start being productive. I remember how happy I was with Bogumił in Krępa, after we got the manor. The barometer shows good weather coming. They must have begun harvesting in Serbinów. Right after summer I'll take care of my son. I must work on his character. I won't pay any of your bills! Mamma! My dearest mamma! It's the last time, I swear! It's all because I'm missing Jadwinia so much! I can't live without her! After trade school, I'll study in France to be close to her and then we'll get married and, mamma... I'll be a proper man then! So please, mamma... pay just this once! How much do you owe? Well... it's this one and a... few older debts. Christ, son, you're tearing me apart! How much is it in total? I don't know... It's several hundred roubles I think. Several hundred roubles?! I won't give you the estate money! It's your father's life's work! It's sacred to me. But mamma, you still have some... jewellery. After all, you don't need this thing any more. You can sell it. Basia, selling such a valuable thing is a mistake. - Particularly beautiful! - There's a pressing matter - that I need money for immediately. - I know. Tomaszek's debts. If I were you, I'd put an ad in a newspaper that I'm not liable for my son's debts. Signed: Barbara Niechcic, full stop. I believe I'll change his careless heart one day. Change your mind, come with us to Zabłocie. It's so beautiful there! - Sewcio has renovated it all! - No dear, I'll stay in Kaliniec. I feel bad leaving you alone in this dusty town. I have the Ostrzeńskis and Ceglarski. It's not a wasteland! Agnieszka is visiting in August and I have Julka! Take your seats, please. - Take your seats, please! - Au revoir. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Godspeed! - Tomaszek! - Godspeed. Emilka, take care of him! He needs a lot of kindness. Goodbye, my boy. - Goodbye, mamma! - Mamma! Take care! Goodbye! There's a war coming between France and Germany. Reportedly, the Russians are going to retreat behind the Vistula River. I heard it from one officer, a Pole. The army leaves tonight. The patrols will stay until dawn and go as well. Kaliniec seems like the best place to stay during this war. I am curious where the first, historic battle will take place! Julka, maybe there won't be a war between Russia and Germany! Look, how they march! It's like the manoeuvres! It's war mobilisation! The war's on! - But how? - Mobilisation! War? And my children are so far away... In my shop there are no cigarettes left! Madam, what's going on? The stores are empty! Mobilisation! War! We're leaving town in two days! Madam! Madam, the war has started! The whole town is talking! Maybe I should stay the night? I'll only go tell my old man and be right back. Mhm... My dear Julka... I am not afraid of such things. Anyway... they won't kill us all, and even if they do, you won't be of much help. But... if your children arrive during the night, then I'll make tea or something. No, I'll do it myself. Nothing's happening. The Russians left. The Germans will march through and leave too. Germans are a refined nation. And they are not at war with us, but with Russia. Quick, let's go! - Basia! Basia! - Aunt, come with us! - Grab whatever you can! Quick! - Quick, Barbara! We're leaving! You must come with us! Grab your things! There's no time to lose! Basia! For the love of God! Germans are on the outskirts! They'll burn the town! Burn it! Godspeed, I'm staying! You go! I can't! Basia, what are you doing! You'll die here! Then I will! I must wait here for my children! In Serbinów they must have started cutting the wheat. And the barometer is showing a change of weather. Bogumił would be worried. Mrs. Barbara! I beg of you, quick! He'll go without us! Don't leave! Don't leave yet! Mrs. Barbara! Quick, get some warm clothes! Now! - Off! We don't go any further! - You leave us here? - Look what's going on! The Prussians! - Jesus Christ! Sir, take me to Nieznanów, to my children! Sir, please! Sir, please take me to Dr. Wettler, to Nieznanów! Sir, take me to my children! Maybe you could take me to Nieznanów? Bogumił, save me and our children. Honourable Mrs. Niechcic, don't you remember me? It's me! Szymszel from Kurza! - How are you doing, Szymszel? - Well, I work as a carter, madam. I drive to Kaliniec, to Czałbowo. I transport goods. Or people. How many people have I transported lately! But I'd prefer not to earn a single kopeck rather than look at all this. And now I'm ready to take you, Mrs. Niechcic, wherever you want to go. Five versts from here there is the Borowno village. Mr. Toliboski's estate is two versts away. No, I won't go to the manor, turn back. Let's ask for a room among the peasants. There will be filth and stench... And Mr. Toliboski is a great master. He has a lot of rooms. It's not a manor. It's a palace! He'll take you in with open arms, Mrs. Niechcic. Giddy up! Honourable Mrs. Niechcic, do you know Master Toliboski? Yes, I used to know him. But it was so long ago, that today we would hardly recognise each other. - I heard he's a widower now? - Indeed. But the children inherited a fine estate from their mother's side. And Mr. Toliboski... He is a real master now! Szymszel, turn around! You see what's going on here! Mrs. Niechcic, this is the end of days! This war has driven people mad. - Turn around, please! - People! What are you doing? Disperse! Please don't be upset, but we really have no more room left. Excuse me. You must also be from Kaliniec, madam. Father went to another grange to put some of the people there and told me to apologise to all of you. But we really have no room left. Father told me to direct everyone to Chety and Jastrzębice. They have room. Good, that's very convenient. Thank you. I happen to know Mr. Katelba from Jastrzębice well. Thank you very much.
