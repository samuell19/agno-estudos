Going to school? Yes. Good. You're such a good girl Chizuko. Always bright and cheerful. But aren't you late? Mika forgot something. Mika, you're Chizuko's little sister? Always with your sister, huh? Well, goodbye. Have a good day. Long ago, in someone's heart, These words were born... Wherefore art thou, my little objects? Why dost thou hide when I seek thee? Raising my hand in the wind, I visit the unseen forest, To search for your song like hide-and-seek Found it. I'm borrowing these. Thanks. Dummy. What were you doing in Chizuko's room? And you, Dad? Business trip again? Where to? Kobe, four or five days. Four or five days, huh? Where are you going with your father? Going to Mako's to study. I already told you. You did? I did. Didn't I, Dad? I'll be back in two or three days. I'll be alright. Chizuko's with me. Mom... There's rice on your face. Those two are so hopeless. It would really help if they put away their dishes like Chizuko. You're usually slow, but you're quick today. It's the first time I've walked this route with you. You're right. Do you always go this way? Yeah, since the incident. I didn't know there was such a route. I'm like a cat. I know all the back ways. Why did you suddenly decide to go to piano lessons? I thought you hated it. I should get back to a normal life. The concert is coming up too. Besides, the teacher must be worried. I haven't been there since the incident. - Oh yeah? - What? I'm surprised you're so considerate. Do I look that hopeless? So, this is where we come out. Didn't you know that, Dad? This town is like a maze. Don't stay out late, Mika. You called me Mika. What do you mean? You... that girl... Chizuko's sister... That's all I was. Please understand, I don't want to leave your mother alone. Then come home quickly. Two or three days, right? Have a good trip. That looks... good. I'd... like one. It's sweet. I don't want your money. Are you alright? Can you walk? Let me go! Are you alright? Let me go! I know you. I've seen you around town before. I love you! I love you! I love you. Beneath the Wheel Thanks a lot. Take care. - Next week then. - Goodbye. Miss Kitao! What happened? My sister... Chizuko? I don't see anybody. Mako, aren't you going to school? But she isn't here yet. I wonder what's wrong? Mika looks well nowadays. It's good to go together, but you shouldn't be late. Mika's so slow. Treasure your friendship. Good morning. - Miss Kitao! - Shh... Hello, is Mika there? Oh, that's okay. Hi Mom, everything's alright. Bye. Sorry, I'm late. - Goodbye! - Bye! My homemade lunch. Get going! Bye, Grandma! The bicycle's here. Yeah, I took it out. Sorry. If I'm late again, you should go on without me. I'll just leave the bike out. - Bye! - Have a good day! So then I beat that pervert up. You're kidding! How could a slowpoke like you do that? Even the policeman complimented me. Good morning! Come on, don't you believe me? I know. You think I'm crazy, right? Can't blame you. My family's had all these shocking events... I didn't mean it like that! Honest! Everything was hazy, but I'm sure it was my sister! Maybe I am crazy. Never talked about her before. Will the term exams be okay? Shock treatment! Don't worry, Mika. You're bright. Chizuko was legendary with the exams, and you're her little sister. The trouble is that you daydream sometimes. You're right. Welcome home. What a surprise! Did you hear my footsteps or something? I got tired of waiting. It's been three days. Didn't I say two or three days? If you say two or three days, I'll wait on the second day. Oh, she's singing. It's been a while since you heard Chizuko's song. Please give voice to the thoughts of grass Raising my hand in the wind, I visit... Aren't you going to cook? You always take such long baths. Chizuko! You're getting pretty womanly. Pervert! Stingy! Chizuko, have you always been by my side? Yeah. Would you have stayed invisible if I didn't get attacked? Probably. I'm glad I got attacked then. Dummy. - Chizuko... - Yes? Thanks. How could I desert my clumsy sister? I'm so helpless. Sorry, Mika. I had to leave you all alone. The policeman said, "She's a brave girl." "She hit him on the head." "We found him staggering there." "Seems he's done it before. We'll question him." I see. So, Mika's done a heroic deed. I was so worried. She lied to me about going to the piano lesson. Well I'm glad she's alright. Don't walk around like that! Hi Dad. You're home early. Kobe beef... What? Why are you staring at me? So, you're old enough to get attacked... Don't be weird, Dad! Mako called. Will you call her back? Yes. Hey, stay inside. I'm old enough to have secrets. You'll catch a cold! Hello Mika? So, do you think you'll pass? It may be easy for you. You know I'm hopeless with math. Give it your best shot! Are you going again this year? Going where? The 9th. Oh, the 9th Symphony. Please go. Chizuko! What? Won't you go? Let's go, Mika. Let's listen to the 9th as usual. Mika, you listening? You want to? "Want to?" So, you're going? Yes, I am. Good. I'll reserve your ticket. Yes, for two. For two? For you and me. Your sister? That song. Yes. I'll get your ticket. Bye bye. That girl, sneaking into Chizuko's room again... She really is stubborn... and spoiled... Just like me. It's impossible. I can't do it. I'm not like you. Dummy. You'll really catch a cold. Hurry and get dressed. You'll get attacked again. Then lend me that uniform. I love it. No. For the 9th, you must wear this chic black dress. Don't I have a say? Be ladylike. Chizuko... Do you have experience? Dummy! Please forgive me! No way! You broke a rule. If you told me you were getting dressed up, I probably would have dressed up in Mom's red-dyed kimono. Sorry. I was bad and betrayed my best friend. But I had no choice. Chizuko absolutely insisted that I wear this black dress for the 9th. I'll never understand your girlish behavior. I'm a fool... Thanks. But when you wear that dress, you really seem a lot like Chizuko. You mean I'm nothing like her without it. Don't get defensive. It's not cute. I made one other promise: When the choir starts, I'd go buy hot chocolate. Oh, come on! Thanks for waiting. - My treat. - Thanks. It's good. Chizuko bought us the hot chocolate last year. That's right, we drank it out in the cold. The steam was warm and made us feel so happy. Hey, I have to go to the bathroom. Please wait here. It's you... Sorry. I made a mistake. You must be her younger sister? You're Mika, aren't you? I knew it! Chizuko told me about you, right here. Then she said the hot chocolate was getting cold, and ran off. Is she with you? Not this year. Did she tell you anything about me? No. Then say hello to her for me. Goodbye. I get the hint. Some friend you are. No... She's... my sister... Wait! Wait! Please wait! Yes? My sister won't come. But she's right here. Look at me. She's looking at you now. Through my eyes. She'll be alright. She's basically just anemic. Sorry for troubling you. He held you up in his arms, like in a movie! Didn't know, huh? - Wouldn't have let him if I knew. - You're blushing. - Your orders please? - Coffee. - Coffee. - Yes. Tomoya Kaminaga, Shipping Technology Department, Hiroshima Tech. Wow. What year are you? I'm a senior. We're students of Onomichi Girl's Junior High. I'm Mako Hasebe, and this is Mika Kitao. I already know a lot about Mika. Writing a novel, right? Oh, Chizuko... This is my first time meeting you, but I envy such close sisters. Because I'm an only child. Are you...? You're getting all the attention... I recognize that uniform. Were you and my sister just friends? "Let's listen to the 9th next year." "And when the chorus begins, let's meet here." That's what we promised. On October 27... My sister died. Hurry up, we'll be late. You left your shoes by the garden again. Can't you do something about your hair? I need a haircut. Again? You'll go bald. Here's your lunch. Eat it all. You have low blood pressure, so be careful. You're acting like a mother. Don't forget, okay? Detergent, tissue paper, milk, lemons... - I'll buy them on the way back. - Please. - Dad's coming home tomorrow. - Yes. - Mom, the newspaper. - I'll get it later. Bye. Chizuko... There's blood. Oh, it's just thread. Hurry. We'll be late. Sorry, you go ahead. What is it? Forgot something. You're just like me. True. Isn't it in your bag? What is it? It's nothing like that. Go on. Watch out Mika! Mika! Chizuko... Chizuko... Mika... Mika... Chizuko! Chizuko, what happened? Chizuko! - I'll get Mom! - Wait! Don't go. Stay with me. I'll get help. I'm dying. It's no use lifting this. Don't say that. Listen, when I'm gone... Mom won't get over it easily. You have to be strong. Understand? You're more talented than I am. It's true. I'm just skillful and stand out. But you have real talent. Chizuko! Have confidence. It's your life. Be confident in your own choices. I'll watch over you. I'll be by your side. Don't die Chizuko! And don't talk now. Alright... I just wanted to tell you this. I feel like... I've experienced this before. I wanted to read more of your novels. Chizuko! Welcome home. Chizuko. Did you have a good time? Yeah. I told him everything. Everything about you. Thank you. Too bad you couldn't come with me. I really blew it didn't I? I was really clumsy like you that day. You can't always be lucky. Is it really okay? I thought you had work. Come on dear, it's Sunday. They say it's important, but it'll just be another party. I'll go take a look later tonight. I wouldn't have minded if you went. The concert will only remind me of Chizuko. Mika worked very hard. We should see her perform. Do you really think she can play it right? Relax. Chizuko... Didn't I promise I'd always be by your side? How can I perform after a kid like that? You'll just have to do your best. But I'm the one who'll end up embarrassed. I want to go home. What are you saying? Didn't you choose to come here? I was thoughtless, pressured... Gullible and careless... Really stupid. Encore! Encore! It's your turn. Now we'd like to present Miss Mika Kitao... Straighten your back. Now we'd like to present Miss Mika Kitao... Straighten your back. ...Mika is Chizuko's younger sister. ...Mika is Chizuko's younger sister. Two years ago, Chizuko was excellent... Be majestic. Two years ago, Chizuko was excellent... Two years ago, Chizuko was excellent... I told you I didn't want to come. This year, Mika will play the same piece, Schumann's "Novelletten." Silence please. Please, Miss Kitao. Yes. Relax. Have confidence. Open your eyes. First chord. Forte! Play with strength. I skipped. Just continue. Most people won't notice. Mariko, what a surprise. My cousin dragged me along. She's not bad. Who's your cousin? Over there. Prince Charming. Next is Miss Saiko Watade, who will play another Schumann piece. You were great. I didn't know Tomoya was Mariko's cousin. But you certainly deserved the flowers. Mika, I told you you could do it. That's easy for you to say. I'll always be known as Chizuko's little sister. Would it be better if I went away? Maybe... No, I'll let you stay. I met Tomoya because of you. You're just a kid. You're just a ghost. You're jealous? Don't be silly. By the way, clean up a little. Tomoya would run away if he saw this mess. I won't let anyone in this room. Anyone can come in with the door open. What is it, Dad? What is it? I thought you were with someone. Talking to myself. I was thinking up some lines for my novel. Listen... About the concert today... Who was that young man? His name is Tomoya Kaminaga. Where did you meet him? He's Chizuko's friend. Anything wrong? Goodnight. Goodnight. Have you had your first crush? I'm not forcing you to answer. I've had no chance going to an all girl's school. I suppose. If there is a boy you like, bring him over. What's with you, Dad? Well... When Chizuko was about your age, there was a bit of trouble. Your mother and I had to forbid her from seeing a boy. We still regret doing that. We should have left her alone. I don't know if she ever forgave us. Now go to bed. I didn't mean to tell you that. Why didn't you ever tell me about that? You were only a child. Did you hate Mom and Dad for that? It's all over now. Go to sleep. (reciting sutra) You want a ride? Idiot! I see her! Mika! She's slow... Didn't her teacher say... Most of the students in her class are slow runners? Don't be disappointed if she's last. They're all doing their best. Hello! I came here in Dad's car. - How's it going? - Second place just finished. What about Mako? She finished 6th. Passed someone just before the finish line. If Mika isn't passed, she'll finish 6th. She'll do her best! Anyway, she isn't last. Go for it, Mika! I can't... Don't give up. Just one more push. Don't you know I have low blood pressure? Don't pretend that you're sick! Now, lift your thighs more. Breathe from your abdomen. I can't do everything that you can do. That I can do? But you're running with your own legs. Give it a try! Alright! I did it, Chizuko! See ya. - She's coming! - She's 4th! She could be 3rd! Dear... Mika! Go for it! Mika! Dear... Didn't she look just like Chizuko? Yes, she looked just like Chizuko. Back when Chizuko was in 3rd year of Junior High. Her last spurt was amazing. Oh, Dear... Remember her. She would be happy to be remembered like that. Mika! Mika, are you okay? Are you okay? You did really well! "I want to go far away," she said with a sigh. This was Chizuko's secret side. Every time she sighed, her younger sister wondered why. Because she was so talented, bright, pretty, and loved by all. She seemed like the happiest person in the world. Why would she want to go away? It would have been more natural for her slow and clumsy little sister to wish to be taken away. But when I think about it now, Chizuko had a lot of anxieties, despite the fact that she acted cheerful. She didn't want her little sister to worry. I realize that now. I'm sorry I always write about my sister. But there isn't much to say about myself. Does Mariko talk about me sometimes? Well, if she does, it's probably about my clumsiness. Even so, anything she says about me that reaches your ears, would make me very happy. Goodbye. P.S. Please take me far away. Your Mika I lost something. What is it? You can never find anything. What is it? You won't tell me? A love letter... You're hopeless. Isn't it in your desk? It wasn't there when I looked. Just call him. No letter, no hassle. I don't want to give it to him. I've never written to Tomoya. It's like my diary. Really? You're so old-fashioned. You're just like a living fossil. Don't be mean. Let's get ice cream. But he'll never know how you feel. So? It doesn't matter if he knows. All my dreams come true in my fantasies. But in real life, they all just fade away. That's my fate. Got it, old chum. I'm glad, old chum. "Please take me far away." "Your Mika?" Mako, don't look! Yes, Mako don't look... And the lesson is over. Lunch time. Speak up! Who did this? You degenerate! You're infringing on your classmate's privacy. Apologize to Mika! Let's eat. Let's have lunch. But you'll have no playtime after that. The class president will demand a class court. I'll wash my hands. "P.S. Please take me far away." - "Your Mika" - Stop it! Haven't you had enough? How could you, Chizuko? You're horrible! I've never been so humiliated. Chizuko! Sorry. How could I forsake you at a time like this? Chizuko... Are you finished? Your depression certainly goes away very quickly. I really wanted to die. Can't you understand? Wouldn't a dead person understand? Sorry. You don't need any help. Don't be mean. You know yourself better than you think. I do? When you're depressed, there's another you looking at yourself. You think so? That's your strength. - Hi! - Hi. Mariko did it. She told me. She meant it as a joke. Please forgive her. She's been a bit unstable recently. I think she also meant to tease me. I'm sorry. That's all. I just wanted to apologize to you. Sorry I took your time. But... it also made me happy. Don't be fooled. You might forgive her, but I won't. I'll get Mariko for sure. She's been absent. There's something wrong... Mika, tomorrow's Sunday. Let's go and give her hell! - Sorry Mako. - You're late! What's with that outfit? What about yours? Is that supposed to look threatening? Can't be helped. You're a hopeless romantic. Let's go. This is your show. I'm just backing you up. Be steady. Mako, I don't really care anymore. What? Some things just have to be settled. Hello? Hello? Who is it? We're Mariko's classmates. I'm Miss Hasebe. This is Miss Kitao. Miss Kitao... You must be Mika. Yes. I see... Mariko... Isn't here right now. Where is she? She's with some relatives. Is that why she's absent from school? Sorry, I can't tell you anything. That's alright. You came all this way... My daughter really... Needs friends. I'm sorry. Nobody's supposed to be in this house. That's why Mariko's staying with her relatives. Have a good day. Mika, let's go. Um, if you do get in touch with Mariko, will you tell her to call me? Yes, of course. I'm really sorry. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bankruptcy. They're bankrupt. I can feel it. Your house is an inn. You've seen all sorts. I guess we're still kids. Mako! Mika! - How was it? - I have a souvenir for you! My mom bought a cool glass vase. But when we got home and she opened the package, she found that the neck was broken! Dad got mad about the bad packing. Mom was nearly in tears, same as she was before the trip. But that's just the way we Kitaos are. On the other hand, your souvenir is alright. At worst it's flattened. Steamed buns! I'm so hungry after working hard. I'll eat them now! It's good! Eat, eat them all! Actually, I have something for your mom and dad too. Spicy cod roe. What's wrong? He died. What? My dad died. Why? Three days ago... We already had a funeral. California... I wonder what it's like. You think it's warm, Chizuko? You're not answering me again. You're not nice these days. Hey, you could help me by telling me some of the answers during the test. Come out, Chizuko! I'll play your theme. Long ago, in someone's heart, These words were born... Long time, no see. These words were born... Long time, no see. Please give voice to the thoughts of grass Please give voice to the thoughts of grass It's getting cold. Can ghosts feel it? I mean, the temperature? I can feel it with my heart. That so? Yes. Would you feel it if I fell in love with Tomoyo? You're still just a child. I'm not a child. I've already written a love letter. Silly girl. And the tests? Don't they start tomorrow? I want to go to a land without any tests. Raising my hand in the wind, I visit the unseen forest, To search for your song like hide-and-seek Mom... There's a call from Miss Maeno. Maeno? Mariko? Tomoya and I grew up like brother and sister. We were very close. I was really happy. But Chizuko destroyed my happiness. I found her name in his diary. You're her sister. That's why I always hated you. But it's okay now. I'll give Tomoya to you. Give him? I'm tired of it. My mother too. Mariko... That's why... Right now, we're having the luxury of a lifetime. My mother even laughed. Where are you? My mother is taking a bath. We'll take some pills. It won't hurt. We won't feel anything. Wait! Don't do it! Please love Tomoya for me. Didn't he send you a postcard? What was the picture? Mine was Mickey Mouse. What's the matter? I have to stop them! Luxury of a lifetime... A high-class hotel? How stupid. "I'll give Tomoya to you?" Tomoya returned from L.A. yesterday. He must have been shocked. Did he know? She didn't want to tell him about their troubles. Good work, Mika! Mariko told me. You saved her life. Mariko... Yes, she's back in school. Be nice to her. Let's go. "We must begin to feel the anxieties of..." - We already did this. - Are you sure? When? Hey, refresh your memory. All rise. Attention. Bow. I don't know how to thank you enough. Don't say that... But Mariko has been really lonely since her mother died. I should really look after her more from now on. That's nice of you. She's like my little sister. Mariko said... she would give you to me. Sorry... So... would you accept? You aren't an object! Mika! - Not bad, huh? - Mako! Mariko! Mariko! You missed the exams, so I had to subtract 20 percent. But they're still good. Mika... Thank you. I'm glad Mariko is well again. But she's going to high school in Tsuyama. She's going to live with her relatives. Wait! Wait! Mom, get in the picture! I remember Chizuko's graduation. Mika was sending her off back then. We took a picture, the four of us. It's not easy to lose a family member. I think she held up well. Mika really did her best. She's a very interesting child. Mom, Dad! Come with me! This way. Cheese! Thanks! - Mika! - Where are you going? Some friends are getting together for some ice cream and waffles. And a chat. Can I have some money? Mariko, hop on. - Here. - Thanks. Goodbye, Principal! Even though you took the day off from work for her, Mika's really slow. It's okay. Children drift away from their parents like this. And then it will be just the two of us. But is it really okay to suddenly cancel your business trip? What business is more important than my child's graduation? Children are good. They have an energy for life, which we don't have. I wonder if Mika will really be okay... She doesn't have many of Chizuko's characteristics, but she thinks well in her own way. That reminds me of something... I once met with her teacher because I was worried about her. And then... You don't need to worry about Mika. You should be more concerned about Chizuko. Even though she appears level-headed, she's still a child. Hello, I'm Takahashi. Ah, Ms. Takahashi. Thank you. You've done well this term. I realized that I subconsciously thought of Chizuko as a grown-up. And I felt sorry for her. It's terrible to say this, but for a long time, I thought that Chizuko would have wanted to disappear to some other place. And that she would have found it easier that way. I was always relying on her, and I'm afraid that was a heavy burden on her. You're imagining too much. But you can imagine if you want. They're such good children. We should take good care of our family. For Chizuko's sake too. Do you always push your bicycle like this? No, I usually keep it at Mako's. But I can't ride a bicycle to high school. This is the last day. I see. Here is okay. No, I'll walk you to the door. We want to be alone, just us two. "Us two?" Me and Chizuko. I was able to graduate because she was with me. That's why I want to walk home with her. I see... Well, if it's your sister, I don't have a choice. Anyway, congratulations. Take care. Thank you for the flowers. I really like them. They made Mako very jealous. And Mariko too. I'm going on a date with her tomorrow. - Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. Take care. She's acting like... a grown-up. Congratulations, Mika. So, we want you to do it. There's no way I can play the lead. I'm still new. Sure you can do it. You're Chizuko's sister. No one played this role better than Chizuko. It's best if you play it. Yes, you should! She fits the part. Long ago, in someone's heart, These words were born... A new star is born! Chizuko! I'm the lead actress in the play! Playing the part of Aphrodite, just like Chizuko. Look, exactly like Chizuko. "Aha! I shall turn thee to stone!" Chizuko, I'll play the prince today. I'll let you play Aphrodite. So, let's practice together. Raising my hand in the wind, I visit the unseen forest, To search for your song like hide-and-seek "Oh Princess, my dearest Aphrodite..." "Has death turned thee to stone?" "Please, show yourself!" "My love for thee is true." "Aphrodite!" Please come out, Chizuko. You're getting lazy these days. "I am here." "Behold, Dear Prince." "Thy love has brought me to life." "Oh Aphrodite, art thou love, or a rebirth?" "Dear Prince!" "I too am reborn!" Chizuko. Mika. Not bad. I thought you might be bored. Forget it. You should stop trying to remember me. I'm not trying. People gradually forget about the dead. That's only natural. I won't forget. No matter what. Are you sure? Even after you fall in love, get married, have children and grandchildren after all those years? Sure. You can be Auntie. Yes yes... Yes yes yes... We used to play like this. For me, everything has ended. But for you, things are just beginning. Practice hard. "Behold, the power of true love!" Mika! This is shocking. Aren't you overreacting? I'm practicing... Your father is going to Ofaru. A business trip? No, it's a term transfer. Well, I am an office worker. But that's... Did I wake you? Were you watching me? Yes, I was. What did you see? Someone who loves her father. Please take care of your mother. I will. Since Chizuko died, she's suffered a whole lot. She depends on others. If there's no one to lean on, she'll fall. I don't want her to get sick again. Don't worry. I'll look after her. You're right. I can trust you. Not a child anymore. How sad. It sure is. Dad? Don't get sick. You sound like a TV drama. I won't miss the school festival. I'll leave the spare pajamas. Grown-ups close their bedroom doors. Ah, an airplane! I didn't know they came around here. There are many things we don't usually notice. It looks like my dad is being transferred to Hokkaido. Probably because he canceled his business trip to attend my graduation. The boss just wanted to entertain clients with golf, so he ordered my dad to take the trip. Your dad is a hero. Your dad isn't a hero, more like a lover. Yes, the only love of my life. Ah, your boyfriend? I'm a daughter from a historic inn. I can't live a life of loving and yearning like you. That's my destiny. - But he seems like a nice guy. - Yes. "Behold, the power of true love" "Because you loved..." "Because you loved the prince," "all the maidens of the forest have been turned to stone!" "They rest in the eternal sleep of death!" Say it like that. "I am Aphrodite, a yearning maiden." "I shall save them all with the power of my love." "How conceited!" "How conceited! Eh!" Like that, okay? "I'll turn you to stone!" "I shall turn thee to stone!" Like that. "Behold, the power of true love!" Not bad... You'll become confident sooner or later. But I warned everyone about this. Being jealous of Mika for having been selected is no joke! Next scene is "Stone Dance of the Maidens." "Behold, the power of true love!" Hello, sorry to keep you waiting. Yes, my daughter. An accident? No, the one who had an accident was Chizuko. You mean Mika? What happened to her? Mika... an accident... Mom? What's wrong? Are you ill? Mika! You're really back? Mom, Mom... Kitao residence. I'm her daughter. My mother is... yes? My father's sick? A bad cold? My mother's sick. Hang up. Call the doctor. Say hello to him for me. Some woman from the Hokkaido office. Kaminaga, humans are strange creatures, aren't they? It can feel like someone is next you, even though they're far away. On the other hand, someone can feel distant when they're right beside you. Which is it with us? Don't say that... Oh, it's the good daughter! Your mother is recovering well, isn't she? Thanks for taking care of her. Don't mention it. You forgot to get the newspaper again. I don't care. It only ends up as more trash. Be sure to wash off all the soap. The foam is still there. You're such a nag. Hey, I'm washing your bowl too. You're really awkward when you do these things. Mind your own business. You'll get wet. You can't hang clothes as well as you can write a novel. Unfortunately, you're right. It's really too bad I can't help you... Chizuko... What? You want to know my secret? What is it? You could do anything well, ever since you were a child. They always just praised you. I was always chanting a spell. A spell? That my sister would go far away. Just kidding. I didn't mean it. Because... I never said it out loud. Well, I can understand. Sometimes I was also ashamed to have such a clumsy, awkward sister. I was thinking you wouldn't be able to live your life without my help all the time. I was a bad girl. Because I didn't understand your kindness. Why don't you tell me how you really feel? Seems like you're holding back... Come on, that's not true. I shouldn't have said anything. Miss Kitao. Mika! Mako! Great timing. I bought you a watermelon, so I could pay you a visit. Thanks. Since you're here, drop in. Why not a change of air? Good idea. Want some more? It's delicious. A high school housekeeper can't afford watermelons. How's your mother? It's the second time. Might take a while. It's worse if we push her. Only time can heal her. Hope you don't collapse. You're working too. But I can't take Chizuko's place. You're Mika. Be yourself. Chizuko shouldn't have died. It should have been me. Idiot! You say that again and I'll hit you. But if I were Mom, I'd prefer Chizuko to be alive. I said I'd hit you, Mika! The only thing I can say is that God chose for you to live. That's why you have to live for Chizuko too. Even if it's hard, happy or unhappy, you have to be strong and live. Your life is a gift. Still, I wonder who made that phone call. Giving me hell again? I won't take the lead role in the musical. That's just your style. Dad? Hello. You lost weight. It was a terrible cold. I heard about it. A lady called when Mom collapsed. Are you alone? Who else would be here? That's true. Hungry? I already ate. Mom! Dear, weren't you ill? Yes, but it wasn't serious. Smells like cigarettes. Yes, it's vacation time. The train was crowded. I'll leave you two. Oh, it's the good daughter! Your mother is... recovering well, isn't she? Doctor... Is my mom really sick? Yes, she is. She acted like she understood everything. That's what illness is like. Then I'm sick too. What are you talking about? A sickness of dreaming. I'm a lot like my mom. It's wonderful, isn't it? Dad! Let's go home. Actually, this is bad for her. I'd like a ride sometimes. Dad's tie... What? It's new isn't it? It's nothing... really. He didn't buy it himself. It's not his style. So, Dad... What? Mom is sensitive. She noticed it. Oh no... What's wrong with you? I'm going back tomorrow. Will you be alright? Going back? "Behold, the power of true love!" Get the horse ready. Get the petals ready, Mika. Okay. Long ago, in someone's heart, These words were born... Please give voice to the thoughts of grass You're the one who was supposed to be there. Singing this song in the spotlight. I'm sure you would be better. Chizuko... I understand now. It's not that I couldn't play the role. I chose not to. And don't say anything now When I'm backstage, there are no bright lights. But I can see the whole world from here. Happiness, sadness, everyone's feelings... That's why this is my stage. Be happy, Chizuko. Your clumsy little sister has found her own place. Mako, you waited for me? Thought you might be depressed. Thanks, old chum. Mika! Mika, come back! Hurry! Hurry! Just come! Mika, Hurry! Join us! You had trouble at home and declined the part, so here's a consolation prize. Be careful. I'm sorry. I was upset that I couldn't play the lead. So, I made that phone call. Your mother must have been surprised, huh? My mom could never accept my sister's death. So, we never had a proper memorial. But Chizuko's so pitiful like this. She can't move on from this world. I can finally hold a memorial service since the others are gone. What a strange family. Kaminaga... Why so suddenly... Kaminaga... I'm sorry. Goodbye. It's good! Don't force yourself. But I'm really hungry! It's getting cold again. Yeah, it's the season of the 9th Symphony. Sorry. I don't have a ticket this year. They didn't eat all the lunches. They were too shy. They should've taken them home. Your priest cousin was looking with regret. He wouldn't eat them. Our box lunches have been unpopular since my dad died. Sorry. I'll go home. Stay a bit longer. I have to help my family. I see. Sorry. Goodbye. Someone from our inn will pick up the lunch boxes. The phone... It's fine. Mako! Thanks for today. Goodbye, old chum. Goodbye. Hello? Dad? It's been ages. Anything in particular? Nothing much. The cultural festival? It's over. Did I do well? I was in charge of props. Mom will be in the hospital for a while. You should call the hospital yourself. Well, I'm waiting for a call from my friend. What do I want? Maybe Mom and Dad... Bye. You'll upset your stomach. Then why don't you eat it? It's all for you anyways. - You've become touchy. - I can't help it! Dad forgot your 2nd anniversary memorial. Mom thinks she's in the way. A burden. The doctor said it's hard to persuade her otherwise, since it's not about logic. It's all Dad's fault. It's impossible for a child like me to understand problems between parents. But you have such a good friend. And didn't Kaminaga come for you? I think he came for you. Where in the world were you? Watching everything. But it's strange to watch your own memorial service. Was it unnecessary? No, it made me happy. It's true that I must move on from this world. And... It's not true that Kaminaga only came for me. Don't say any more. Even I know a little about myself. Because I'll be your age next year. That's true. You're already a grown-up. But stay with me like this forever. Because... I'll always do stupid things. It would be nice if I could. Why must everyone disappear from me? Let's go, Dad. Or are you afraid to see Mom? Don't be silly. You're afraid she'll say, "I don't want to go home." She won't say that. I talked to her on the phone. Isn't the snow pretty, Dad? Yeah. Did you bring it with you from Hokkaido? "So many people are here. I'd like to cordially thank you all." "I first met the groom, Takuma Gojinjodaiko..." His name is Gojinjodaiko! It makes everyone laugh... Oh, it's the good daughter! Thanks for taking care of her. She got angry because you were so late. She says she'll stay here with me. Yes, you'll be too lonely without me. Now she'll be going home. And I'll go to the mountains to gather firewood. What am I saying? I'll go to Gojinjodaiko's wedding, of course. Excuse me. Be nice to her. It was good. It's best to make food at home. I got tired of eating out. Hokkaido is a bit inconvenient. This is the first time I've eaten Mika's cooking. It was really good. What do you think for New Year's meal? Why don't you ask Mako, like usual? The end of the year is very quiet. I'm going upstairs. I have writing to do. Leave the dishes. I'll wash them later. It's raining. I fell asleep. Tired? I'm not feeling too well. Chizuko, did you have your period that day? Yes, it was earlier than usual. So, whatever you forgot was... I can't always have it with me. It's a hassle to be a woman. I have to wash the dishes. Mom already did. What are they doing now? Dad's staring at the train time tables. Mom is drinking tea. And I'm here with you. It seems like you died such a long time ago. I'm going downstairs. Coming? Mika, you'd better go upstairs. No, you stay here. This is Miss Uchida. She just stopped by. You've been good to my husband. It's no trouble. It must be cold up there. Have some hot tea. Okay. Yes, it was snowing this morning. It snowed here too. It's rare though. Are you from Otaru? No, I'm from Sendai. My mother is dead and my father lives with my brother. Has my husband done anything rude to you? I'm so sorry. You're kind. I knew right away that you were a good person. I... I can't separate from your husband. I'm so sorry. No, it's my husband's fault. You don't need to apologize. I'm sure you've heard... I've been in a hospital for some time. I can't live by myself. If I were well, and if you and my husband were really in love, I'd let him go. Please understand. It may sound childish, but... When he's not around, I get very scared. You must know, I lost my older daughter. I didn't recover easily. I pulled through because my husband and daughter helped me. Now, if you were to take my husband away... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I won't trouble you anymore. Dad, you're awful. Mom had to apologize for you. Why don't you say something? Dad! Mom? Be careful. Mika, you want to leave me, just like your father. Laughing about me. I'm so troublesome. When Chizuko died... I should have died too. Stop it! I need you, Mom! I need Dad too. Still up? Go to bed now. Mom's asleep. Is she gone? Yes. I walked her to the bridge. I thought she might get lost. Selfish woman... You can think ill of her, but don't say things like that. I slept with her only once. I only responded to her kindness. She's a good person. No lies, no slander. She knew Mom wasn't well. How could she do that? That's enough. I think she wanted Mom to commit suicide, so she could have you for herself. I don't... I don't need anyone. I hate adults. Mika, calm down. Go away. You can't do this. Leave me alone. This is my business. Mika! Go away, Chizuko. Dear? Weren't you asleep? I forgot to take a bath. You want a bath? It must have been cold outside. Yeah. Tomorrow, I... I'll go back to the hospital, if you want me to. No. Don't you want to be here for New Year? What about you? I want you to stay. Sorry Chizuko. I didn't mean what I said. Chizuko? Where are you? Chizuko! Don't be mean. Chizuko, you're in there? Come out. No. This is the other world. So, you went... I'm sorry. I'm a thoughtless sister. (Sa-yo-na-ra.) What is it? Mom... Where's Dad? In the bath. What's wrong? Just now... My face looked like Chizuko's. It's strange. We don't look that much alike. No Mika. You look exactly like Chizuko. But you're Mika. My precious daughter. It's a shipping business. So, I'll be going to various parts of the world. Can you join me? Going somewhere far away was Chizuko's wish. As for me, when I close my eyes, I can go to any time or any place I like. I can also meet anyone I like. That's why I'll stay here. I see. I'll miss you then. So, Dear Sister, I'm all alone again. Dad returned to Otaru, and Mom is better off in the hospital. But I'll always be with Chizuko. I'll be with her more and more often. Because now I know another way to be with her. I'm going to write about her. When she was alive, and after she died. Perhaps nobody will believe me, but I don't care. Because I don't write just to be read. It's just my way of remembering her forever. This was my sister's pen. I shouldn't complain, but she used this pen for a long time, so it's a bit hard to write with. Long ago, in someone's heart, These words were born... Please give voice to the thoughts of grass Raising my hand in the wind, I visit the unseen forest, To search for your song like hide-and-seek Listen to my footsteps, Look in front of you, And don't say anything now Sleeping alone in the sand, Dreaming together in the dew, Having a floral banquet of joy and sorrow Time has passed, And everything has been lost Only our thoughts, drifting in the fog Now that our hearts are far apart, I come alone to my mind Separated from your dream like hide-and-seek Listen to my song, Look at my smile from far away, And hold me tight now Time has passed, And everything has been lost Only the thoughts of grass, drifting in the fog Born alone in the sand, Living together in the dew, A floral souvenir of joy and sorrow Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi
