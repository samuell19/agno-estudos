"A disclaimer often found in movies' credits." What you have to do is simple. Go to the back door and kick it. There's a window with frosted glass. He'll see your silhouette. It's important that...... ...he knows you're there. Tragedy will come knocking on their back door. The next station is Sendai. Passengers going on to further destinations. please change trains. Ladies and Gentlemen: You'll arrive in Sendai. Shiina shoe shop. It's me. You made it then. You know my CD player? I thought I packed it but can you check my room? - Have you tried tongue? - Not yet. You have to try the BBQ-ed tongue. The guidebook recommends it. Yes, I know. Go check my room. - How was the tongue? - I haven't tried it yet...... How's Sendai? I don't know yet. I've just got here. You know. we can afford to send you money for your education... ..only because I worked very hard. But I don't want you to be concerned about that. ...Thanks... I can't rind it. No? Where is it then? Have you introduced yourself to your new neighbors? Excuse me! I just moved into room 102. My name's Shiina. Heres a small present for you. Oh. Dylan? Bob Dylan. You're new Yes. Are you living next door? You need help? No. it's almost done. Come to my place then. Uh... well... You like Bob Dylan? His voice is the voice of God. Uh-huh, God... Your name? It's Shiina. Shiina... Shee-na... That's unusual. Here. We'll be neighbors so here's... ...a small gift. Thank you. My name's Kawasaki. What's the "Kawa" character? Does it mean "river"? Or "water creature?" "Water creature" I guess. ...You guess".? Cheers. I'll come in. You from Tokyo? Yes. How about you. Mr. Kawasaki? Drop mister. Call me Kawasaki. Mister sounds unfriendly. I see... There're foreigners in these apartments but... ...whatever they say sounds too polite. I guess my neighbor is a foreigner then. Your neighbor? In relation to you. it would be your neighbor's neighbor. After I'd moved in I gave him a gift and all he said was, "Oh." My neighbor's neighbor... He's from Bhutan. Bhutan... Where is Bhutan? Somewhere in Asia. Asia's a big continent... How come you like singing Bob Dylan songs? I can only sing one song of his. BIowin' in the Wind. Why do you sing that song? It's a long and embarrassing story. Well... It's one of those common stories. There was this girl that l liked all through junior high. Someone told me that she loved Bob Dylan. On graduation day. I asked her to meet me privately... Whose song is that? I guess she didn't love Dylan. Anyway. you have the right voice for his songs. My voice? Really? When I think about it. your voice sounds similar to his. Yeah'? You sure? This is perfect. What is? I've been waiting for someone. I didn't expect that person to have Dylan's voice. Uh-huh... There's something I have to do but I couldn't figure where to begin. I need someone to help me. You do...? It's about my neighbor's neighbor. Oh... The guy from... Bhutan. was it? Yes, the Bhutanese. Kinley Dorji is his name. For the Last 2 years. he's hardly left his apartment. Is he homesick? If I gave him a present he might feel better. He's always wanted a dictionary. Funny, huh? He can't read any Japanese. He's convinced that a dictionary will help him. I can understand that. There are two words he wants to look up. One is the foreign duck and... ...the other is the native duck. Why? He wants to know the difference. So I want to give him a dictionary as a gift. Do dictionaries have such detailed definitions...? No. it would have to be a very good dictionary. One of those big. comprehensive dictionaries. So I'm going to steal the Kanji Garden dictionary. What? What did you say? I'll raid a bookstore and steal a dictionary. Toy guns. One is for you, Shiina. Come and raid a bookstore with me. Thanks for the drink. Either way. I'll do it. If you changed your mind... I don't think I will. One very important thing... Watch out for a pet shop owner named Reiko. Reiko. the pet shop owner. Okay. If you do meet her. don't believe a word she says. OK. See you around. Freshmen. welcome to our university. All the faculty members would like to extend you a warm welcome. We have text books for the first-year Law classes. We have no extra copies. Don't buy more than what you need... Check the classes you're signed up for this semester... ...only buy the books required in those classes. Welcome to Aoba University! You want to play lacrosse? Well... I don't know... Would you like to visit our club? Have you tried BBQ-ed tongue? Not yet. Sendai is known for its BBQ-ed tongue. So I've heard. How about you? Have you checked out the roads around here? I'll able to do 200km/hour at night. I guess you drive like a maniac. I was born to race. you know. I don't like foreigners. You don't? They're hard to figure out. Get in the queue, lady. Excuse me. Watch out for the door. She needs help. Slow down. This is Japan. Speak Japanese. Watch out for the door please. Uh, hello... Do you need help with something? What? I mean... Is there anything you need help with? No. You're better off not talking to him. He's caught up in his own world. He lost his girlfriend. Poor guy. Is this his girl? She likes that song too? She sings it better than you. Oh, yeah? Who did they meet? Did he join a club or something? No... Donkey, watch out! Donkey, don't move! Amazing! But you almost got yourself killed. That was incredible though. I saved this dog, so I didn't die. You not Japanese? That sounds like something you made up. Nobody risks their lives to save a dog. Bhutanese people don't fear death. Why not? They believe in reincarnation. Any living thing is reborn. In the next life you could be one of many living things. So Bhutanese don't kill a pest. If a mosquito stays on my arm. I'll let it suck. It's no excuse for throwing yourself in the traffic. If I were killed by a car. That's because I had done something bad in my previous life. Then you did something good in your previous life. That's why you got to meet me. Pro... bab... ly... And they lived together? Yes. Soon after that incident... ...he moved in with Kotomi! Her name's Kotomi... But why is she with you in this photograph? Did you take his girl from him'? No. it was the other way around. First Kotomi was my girlfriend. She broke up with me and then she met Dorli. Where's the girl you came with? Did she leave'? No girl leaves me. I did. remember? Big smile. Let's go. Dorji. Come on! Let's go. You'll pick up his womanizing habit. Don't speak in English. I'll teach you Japanese. Why you? Teach me Japanese. Mr. Kawasaki. Drop mister. Call me Kawasaki. Mister sounds unfriendly. Teach me Japanese. Kawasaki. Good. You'd be better off with a dictionary. A comprehensive one. Like Kanji Garden. Kanji Garden. Can I use your one? Dictionaries are difficult. So I'll teach you. man. Don't. He teach you only to take girls. I like girl very much. I bet. Slacker. You have no passion. Passion for what? To save a dog from traffic. To stop a girlfriend from leaving you. Or to steal a book that was too expensive to buy. Let's go. Where to? To the bookshop. To steal a book. Why do you have to steal it? I can lend you money. Sharon and Marlon are lovers. living in... ...a brick apartment building. Huh? Sharon likes to look out the window. She waits for Marlon to come home. Sharon is a girl and One rainy day. Sharon looks outside. She sees a drenched kitten on the street. Sharon says to Marlon. "I have to have that wet little pussy cat." "The one you can see from here. The poor wet kitty." Though tired from working all day. Marlon dashes outside. He comes back with the kitten. Well done, Marlon. He wipes the kitten with a towel and hands it to Sharon. This upsets Sharon and she tells Marlon. "I wanted the cat when it was miserable in the rain." "Not the dry one in your arms." "This is not what I wanted." What a sad story". It's the same thing. What? It's the same as what? I don't want to buy a dictionary. That would be different I want one that I steal. What you have to do is simple. Go to the back door and kick it. That's all. Kick it? There's a window with frosted glass. They'll see your silhouette. It's important that you're seen. Why's that important? So that the clerks won't escape. Wouldn't be better if the clerks escaped? Tragedy will come knocking on their back door. I'll be back in half an hour. Will it take you that long? I don't have my watch I better go back and get it. How about Bob Dylan? What...? Blowin' in the Wind is 3 minutes long. Sing it 10 times. then we split. You sing it once and kick the door. Do I have to? Wait! I didn't know you'd finished. So? Did you gel Kanji Garden? It was a cinch. "Kanji Forest" This is not Kanji Garden. Is it...? It's almost the same though. Images from the store's surveillance camera... Show that there was one robber. But were there more? Look carefully. There's someone outside on lookout. Is he one of the burglars? - Let's go get books. - books! We still need more. That' right". We have lots more to buy. When will we finish buying them'? It's the faculty's conspiracy. She's the one from the bus stop. She's beautiful... That's what mature women look like. I have to go to the toilet. I'll catch up with you. Hello... I saw you at the bus stop yesterday. Did you? I was on the bus and... ...I don't know how to say this... Sit down. Thank you. You're not a student. are you? No. I'm not. Sorry I asked. I probably sound angry when I don't mean to. It's just the way I talk. I'm not angry at all. Okay. When I'm angry. I'll tell you. Okay. I own a pet shop in Sendai. Oh, a pet shop... Sorry if I'm mistaken. Is your name by any chance "Reiko?" That's right... How do you know my name? Well... I... Kawasaki told me about you. Kawasaki? Do you know him'? What did your Kawasaki tell you? He told me to watch out for you and not to trust you. Really... Don't you think he's kind of strange? Yes. he's totally strange. Did he tell you about a Bhutanese man? Sure. The one who looks kind of depressed. I came here to look for the Bhutanese man. I thought I might find him here. Looks like he doesn't come to school much anymore. He's my next-door neighbor. I heard that he's depressed over a girl. Now he's withdrawn because she left him. Her name is... Kotomi. She used to work at my shop. You like dogs? They are adorable. He finds it so different. Nobody chains dogs in Bhutan. Well in Bhutan. nobody had to worry about this. "Pet Killers Strike Again! Another Mutilated Dog found." Pet killers? There was a spell of pet mutilations 2 years ago. Pet's thrown into the river. Legs cut off... Legs cut off...? You have sky burials in Bhutan. right? Sky burials? When the deceased are eaten by birds. Is it still done? We should lie the pet killers to a tree for the birds to eat. Hello. Kawasaki. How are you? How are you? Why are you here? We were in the neighborhood and she wanted to see some cute dogs. - Who's she? - My friend. Not anymore. What would you like? What a beautiful woman! What are you doing looking at other women! Do you know about Kawasaki's disease? He's a compulsive seducer. Not that one. Did you buy the textbooks? Hey, wait for me! Guys! I have to go now. Call me. I will. Thank you. A piece of advice. Watch out for Kawasaki. Don't believe the things he tells you. I won't... Thank you. Wait... I think I already have this one... I'll put it back. But... ...maybe I don't have it yet. I'm at school now. Can you do something for me? What? Can you look in my room for something? The key's by the door. Under the extinguisher. Are you in'? Yes. See the bookshelf on your left'? Books? There are textbooks on the top shelf. I can't remember if I bought this book or not. Can you read out the book titles? There aren't any. What? There is no textbooks. They must be there! They're gone... They were stolen. How about your place. Kawasaki? What do you mean? Maybe they came to get it back. What? The Kanji Forest. The bookshop owners have retaliated. Are you serious? Hello. Hi... Were you open last night? Pardon? I drove by last night and the lights were on. Mr. Ejiri must have been still here. Mr. Ejiri One of the clerks. Here. I guess he went berserk again. It was messy when I came in. Did a crime take place? A crime? It's just Mr. Ejiri. The shop owner's son. He has a drug problem. Drugs... They're adorable. Did you come here to tell me that? Uh, no. Well... You mentioned that Kawasaki was sick. Does it have something to do with narcotics? Does he have an addiction? Nice flowers. From Kawasaki. "If flowers exist to brighten the world..." "...you're flower, Reiko." Sorry he's so weird. Sorry he's so wierd. Sorry he's so wierd. What's that? The school gives these to overseas students. Listen and repeat. Over and over. It'll help with my Japanese. Good idea. Good idea. it is. What's that? I went to the hospital. Hospital? Are you sick. Dorji? No. not me. Kawasaki's sick. When did you two become such good friends? I played a trick on him. I bugged Kawasaki with this. You shouldn't have done that... ...but he probably wouldn't mind. ...We can control the virus... And the CD4 behavior... it's not the end. I'm not depressed about it. CD4... Kawasaki may have contracted the HIV virus. You mean. AIDS? That's common misunderstanding. If a person has contracted HIV. it doesn't mean he has AIDS. He only gets AIDS when his immune system deteriorates. You know a lot. You know the cat disease, FIV? I did some research on it. Does Kawasaki have AIDS? Maybe that's why he comes to see me? So he wants to be near you as death approaches.... We broke up before we had sex. So he knows that he didn't infect me. I see. Sharon and Marlon are lovers. living in a brick apartment building. What's that? If I can repeat this. Japanese will be a cinch. A cinch...? Kawasaki taught him that, I'm sure. Sharon says to Marlon. "I want that wet little pussy cat." Hello? Are you already sleeping? It's still 10. I'm just dosing. Mom. How's school? What do you mean? You may have to quit school. What? It's your father. He has stomach cancer. What? Did you say cancer? Come home. He misses you. I'll come home to see him but... ...I've just started university... You said you wanted to become a shoemaker. That was when I was at elementary school. A shoemaker doesn't need a law degree. Don't say that! Make a decision. I'll call back. Bye. What's up? What are you doing? I'm going shopping. 160 yen please. How about looking around first? Anything's fine. Don't you care? Do you have the BBQ-ed Tongue Combo? We don't. The Fried Chicken Combo. It'll take a few minutes. Dhar shing. What? Dhar shing. It's like the prayer flags in Bhutan. The flags have scriptures written on them. So when they flutter, it's like... ...the scriptures are being read. Very convenient. The Bhutanese are lazy. They're good at finding easier ways. By the way, Kawasaki... ...are you sick in some way? What do you mean? I mean... ...It's still cold in Sendai In April. One of the seniors in my class told me... That there were some pet abuse cases in Sendai 2 years ago. You met her. What...? Who? The pet shop owner. No... I have never met her or talked to her. I know the pet killers. You know them...? Yes, I know about them. What? You've met them'? Not me. The Bhutanese guy and Kotomi. It hurts. I'll report you to the police! In Bhutan they play doego. They throw stones and hit a target. You know so much about Bhutan. The Fried Chicken Combo is ready. Thanks. Bye. Are you leaving? You know how to gel back. Goodnight. Here's your change. Don't you have a car? I never said I did. You said you were born to race! That doesn't mean that I own a car. Why don't you rent a car? Who's going to drive? You don't have a license? I'll take the test soon. I thought so... Are you going to quit school? Of course not. Leave me out of it. Let's talk about Kawasaki and the Bhutanese. Did Kawasaki say that Dorji stopped the pet killers? Yes. he used a stone like in the Bhutanese sport. Just once. Once...? Yes, he stopped them once... ...with a stone. I'll report you to the police! Her bus pass... ...had her phone number and address on it. We'll lose him! If we followed him on that desolate road. he'd see us. Where are we? Kawasaki, Dorji and Kotomi. They have their story. Their story...? And you... ...have been dragged into a story that is not yours. Sorry. You don't have to apologize. What was that about the police? Did Kawasaki do that? Kawasaki doesn't exist in this world anymore. Ask the Bhutanese man. Yes? Excuse me but I'm doing an assignment and... I need a Kanji Forest dictionary. Can I borrow yours? I don't have one. I have a regular dictionary but I need it for my class. It's okay then. Where are you form? Is it obvious that I'm not a local? I'm from up north. I guess I'll never shake this accent. Good-bye No textbooks. They're gone. Funny, huh? He can't read any Japanese. "Kanji Forest" "Kanji Garden" You look scary. man. Here's book of Dylan's lyrics. Want to read it? "Guide to Living on Your Own" Is Blowin' in the Wind? in it? Of course it's not! You can't read. can you? So what? What do you mean? I visited room 101. My neighbor's neighbor? Yes. You said a foreign guy was living there. - it's true. - No. A Japanese guy lives in 101 My neighbor's... ...neighbor. My name's Kinley Dorji. I'm from Bhutan. Bhutan... That's far away. isn't it? "The next station is Sendai." Sendai... Sen... dai... Sendai. Sendai. Join our hiking club. Lots of parties. Could you say again. slowly, please! English? Are you a foreigner? Pro... bab... ly... Donkey, watch out! Donkey... Amazing! But you almost got yourself killed. That was incredible though. I saved this dog, so I didn't die. Aren't you a Japanese? My name's Kinley Dorji. I'm from Bhutan. Bhutan? Where is that? A place in Asia. Use these shelves. They're yours, Dorji. Thanks for letting me in. Is that all you have? It's because what I do in Japan is only selling textbooks. Who is this'? It's Bob Dylan. Is the answer blowing in the wind? Yes. Someone I know. he thinks Bob Dylan is a God! And he said... Kawasaki? How do you know? Since I knew you. you keep telling the name of Kawasaki. So cute! Look at me! What's wrong? Don't turn around. Kotomi! Is that Mr. Kawasaki? Isn't he cool'? The real Kawasaki. Why do we have to take a photo? - To commemorate the occasion. - What's that? I've made a new friend. And Kotomi and I are friends again. What did he tell you? He doesn't want to be our friend. No lying please. I'm not lying. I know you did. Where's the girl you came with? Did she leave'? No girl leaves me. I did. remember? Excuse me. Are you ready? Smile. Give a big smile. Here I go. Say cheese! Let's go. Dorji. Come on! Let's go. You'll pick up his womanizing habit. Don't speak in English. I'll teach you Japanese. Why You? Teach me Japanese. Mr. Kawasaki. Drop mister. Call me Kawasaki. Mister sounds unfriendly. Teach me Japanese. Kawasaki. Sharon and Marlon are lovers. living in... ...a brick apartment building. Sharon likes to look out the window... ...she waits for Marlon to come home. If you can repeat that. Japanese should be a cinch. A cinch. right. One rainy day Sharon looks outside. She sees a drenched kitten... ..on the street. Sharon says to Marlon. Nobody could say all this. "I have to have that wet little pussy cat." "The one you can see from here..." Some day. I'll know it off by heart. Kotomi. Let go of me! It hurts. What the hell...? It hurts. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'll report you to the police! Leave them for the birds! We use birds to bury people. Not to kill them. Why did you say "I'm sorry" to them? What I did was bad. I'll be punished in my next life. What you did was good. Violence brings bad karma. We'll have to ask God to turn a blind eye to this. We'll lock Him up and pretend that it never happened. Now God won't... ...see anything. I have a bad feeling about this What do you mean? Don't worry. I'm worried about you. Then send me a bodyguard. What was that about the police? Where's your boyfriend. the one with the stones? I hate him. Grab her legs. Let me go! No! Ouch What are you? I called the police. Are you okay? Why are you here? I'm your bodyguard. What are they? Pet killers. What? Why are they bothering people then'? They were going to beat me up. like they beat up pets. No kidding? Thank you anyway. I'll call the police. Did they hit you? No... Guess they got a lucky hit. Take this parking ticket. Take this parking ticket. Let me. Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. Kotomi. Any empty apartments here'? Why? I want to move in. It'd be more convenient. I'd be his Japanese tutor and your bodyguard. The neighbor will graduate in 2 years. Her place will be empty then. 2 years... You'd better worry about yourself. I know you're not feeling well. I'm okay. I have Dorji. I feel left out. Won't you answer? I'm not able to answer the phone right now. Leave your name and message after the tone. Hello? Kotomi? I know you're there. How many men do you have? You know what's going to happen to you? You'll end up like the cats and dogs. Arms and legs cut off... Stay there. We'll come and get you, bimbo! Kotomi... Kotomi! You have one message. Hello! Kotomi, are you in? How many men do you have? Kotomi, do you know the result? I can't let them get away with it... Kotomi. We'll come and get you, bimbo. I have bad feelings. No. this is our chance. This isn't the car. You don't remember the plate number. do you? This is the one. It's this one. They look same. but different. Dorji. It's definitely theirs. There's an animal in here. Kotomi! Freeze... Calm down... We have to do something. OK... We'll call the police. Stop it! I'm playing. Hey! "Exit" Kotomi! Are they here? Yes. somewhere back in the videogame zone. Are you a foreigner? What's that got to do with anything? Kotomi, you stay here! But... It'll be a cinch. Okay. Go over there. and you'll see at once. Speak Japanese, sir. Not this way. They'll run if they see you. They'll run from the back door. Sharon and Marlon are lovers... ...living in a brick... Brick! And lovers. Get the intonation right. Say tomato. Tomato That's English. Say tomato! Tomato Lovers... Tomato. And lover. .. ...living in... ...a brick apartment. Sharon likes to... "Protesting Mall Construction" From the room... Window. .. Hey, nice legs. No! What you have to do is simple. Go to the back door and kick it. That's all. Tragedy will come knocking on their back door. I know. Have you ever heard God's voice? Bob Dylan... You know his songs? Kotomi told me... Oh, yeah... He has the... ...voice of God.. Stop... You'd better not talk. Dorji... Will really be reincarnated? Sure. That's why the Bhutanese. ..don't fear death. I want to be reincarnated quickly so... ...I can sleep with women again. Why do the Japanese have 2 words for duck? "Ahiru" is for foreign ducks. "Kamo" is for native ones. I'm not sure though. So Kotomi and I are like... Kamo and Ahiru. aren't we? Yeah. You're right. And Kawasaki and me... Look at him. He's a compulsive seducer. Hey. You want to do this? No. Come on! Why do we have to take a photo? - To commemorate the occasion. - What's that? I've made a new friend. And Kotomi and Me are friend again. What did he tell you? He doesn't want to be our friend. No lying please. I'm not lying. I know you did. Dylan? Bob Dylan... We're closed. I wanted him to die slowly so I fed him. I hid the fact that I can't read. You wouldn't have talked to me if you'd known I was a foreigner. Of course I would have. You wouldn't have. You look just like one of us... You look like any ol' Bhutanese. too. If I were an Ahiru. you would be a Kamo. But they look kind of different... This call is important to you. You'd better answer it. Hello? Were you asleep? No. Are you coming back? I want to visit Dad in hospital. Come home today. Today? That's too early. Come home or you'll regret it. Is he in such serious condition? I'll tell you when you're here. What kind of deal is that? Oh, by the way... Didn't you pack the CD player in with your winter clothes? Right... Are you going? Yes. I'll be back though. I'll walk with you. It's been a while. Hello. You'd better turn yourself in. You didn't kill that pet killer. You can explain it to the police. I intended to kill him. I just failed. I want to help those who need help. I feel that way strongly. Me too. Turn yourself in. Pro... bab... ly... What's wrong? I'm locking up God. God should pretend that he didn't see what's happened. Now He's locked up. He'll keep singing forever. Good-bye. You sure you're coming back? I guess so. Will you become a shoemaker? I don't know yet. See you again. When? "BBQ-ed Tongue Combo" The Foreign Duck.
