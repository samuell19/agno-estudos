I was a student at a school for the blind in Tibet. I could see with one eye. So my classmates wanted me to take them somewhere. Everyone wants their dreams to come true. But I had to keep their secret. I was ten years old at the time. I want to go. You're too young. If i lent you the eagle flute. You promised to take us there. No, I only said I'd think about it. Do you know how far Shenzhen is from our school? Grandma, let me go! You can't go. I must go! Why won't you let my go? Just tell me why. You think you will become a star in Shenzhen? Look to the right. Good. Now, look to the left. Good. Good. Thupten needs to have his eye treated as soon as possible. If it is delayed, he's likely to go blind. Okay, bring him to the hospital tomorrow. You can't go on this TV show. Your eye won't last if you don't have the operation. I just want to give it a try. You can't go. Look at the train. Look! Look! Look at the train. Look! The train is coming. Everyone take a step back. Teacher... Why are there so many houses on the train? Those are not called houses. They are called "carriages". Many people can sit inside. Voice map activated. Lhasa... The train is very long. Yongzhou, Wuzhou, Guangzhou Macao, Shenzhen. The locomotive is already so far away. The caboose is still right here. An arm's length away! Kelsang! Why's the lighting like this? Director. Two more backlights will light up on both sides And on the big screen... We'll project two new images. Director, what do you think of these contestants? Messed up again! Remember your position! Director, call for you. Hello. Yeah? When can you arrive? Flight tickets? No problem. Room and board? No problem. What? You want us to go there and bring you here? Director, here's your food. Okay, no problem. Repair method. Replace the screws and tighten them again. Enter the manufacture date of your piano. Enter the location and frequency of its use. 1987, Lhasa, unused for 5 years. I'm sorry, we are unable to repair your piano. Brother Sonam said the TV station's director... will come to Lhasa to pick us up. Brother Thupten already promised to take us there. Sister Droma! Sister Droma! Sister Droma! According to the online encyclopedia... Desire to Sing is a reality show on Shenzhen TV. It aims to respect and encourage everyone's dream. Brother Sonam, let's go! Why did you bring so many pears? They will pay for our trip. The next day we had to set off for Lhasa. If we had gotten there late, We would have missed out on this opportunity. We would have missed out on this opportunity. I had made a promise to my friends. So I couldn't let them down. How far is Shenzhen? An arm's length away! Then what about the ocean? How big is the ocean? As big as a washbowl! Together we make one circle Together we make two circles Together we make three circles Hallelujah Together we make one circle Together we make two circles Together we make three circles Hallelujah... Where did they go? Tell me. Where did the go? Tell me! Sonam pretended to be you and called the TV station in Shenzhen. I heard they want to go to Lhasa to meet them. Thupten needs to have the operation right away. Okay, enough. I know. They are just kids. Make sure you don't shout at them... And bring my cart back! Thupten, I can hear a car coming. Be careful, Thupten, be careful. A proud heart can overcome anything. A proud heart can overcome anything. The prince's jeweled sword... Our cart is broken. Missed call... Director Jiang. The number you have dialed is unreachable. Please leave a message... Director Jiang, I'm Nymda, the teacher. We'll arrive in Lhasa a little later. Don't forget about our air tickets, room, and board. Yes! Don't forget about our air tickets, room, and board. You sound just like our teacher Nymada! How many people are on this thing? Thupten, how many people are on this thing? Three others, not including us. Where are you going? We are going to be on TV. TV! Which station? An arm's length away! Don't tell him! Kelasang! Kelasang! Teacher Nymda has come to stop us! Run! Kelasang! Wait! Kelasang! Kelasang! To Lhasa! Lhasa. Teacher Nymada has come to stop us! If we take the bus to Lhasa, Teacher Nymda is sure to catch us. The cart flipped over, and then we couldn't get on the bus. I had never been on these roads before. What if we went the wrong way? I didn't want this responsibility. I'm tired. Search for a location or address. Selected location. Lhasa. From Shigatse. Destination. Current position. Shigatse area. Thupten, tell us what road we should take? Maybe this way. Then we'll follow you. It's too far. Let's go back. Thupten! Thupten! Don't you want to play the eagle flute with us on TV? Please, Thupten, take us there. Let's go. There's a big river next to us! We know. Hurry up! Brother Thupten wait for us! You can see things! But we can't! Come on. I can't walk anymore. Thupten, do you see a bridge? Yes. But... Let's go another way. Are you scared of the bridge? I'm not scared! Thupten, wait for us! Come with me. Oh, no! Who just fell down? Brother Sonam? -Brother Sonam? -I'm okay! I'm okay too. Thupten? Brother Thupten! Brother Thupten! Brother Thupten! Thupten! Thupten! Thupten! Kelasang, can you lend it to me to play? I won't give it to a coward! If you could see that big river you'd have been scared too. We will definitely make it to Shenzhen. Then everyone will love me back home. Then everyone will love me back home. I'll play some beautiful music on the piwang ''Tibetan fiddle''. The guests will give me many hadas ''Tibetan ceremonial scarves''. I can exchange them for some cash. Five yuan for a whit one and twenty for a yellow one. I want everyone in the village and my grandma... To see me on TV singing. Droma, In your entire life, Being able to weave this cloth is good enough. Director Jiang, I'm Nymda, the teacher. You don't need to come and pick us up. We'll arrive in Lhasa a little later. Don't forget about our air tickets, room, and board. Yes! Don't forget about our air tickets, room, and board. Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. Please try again later. Director Jiang called us. Hello, Director Jiang. Hello. I'm... Teacher Nymda. We've run into some difficulties. Mr. Jiang, our cart flipped over! -We nearly fell into the river. -Kelsang. Be quiet! Stop shouting! Stop it! Hello? Who are you? -I'm Sonam. -Sonam? No, no. Sorry. I'm teacher Nymda. Teacher Nymda? Hello? The battery's dead. Hello? Hello, director. I just want to check with you. Was it a bunch of kids who got in touch with you? Or was it a teacher? How can I remember every single detail! You'll find out when you meet them! Don't forget, if there are any problems... I'll hold you responsible! Idiot! Director, here. Brother Sonam! I really can't walk anymore. Have we gone the wrong way? Let's go back. No, we can't go back. If we don't go back, we'll be eaten by wolves! Kelsang! You said Thupten could take us there. There are no more roads left to take. You said Director Jiang would pick us up. Make him come and pick us up. Director Jiang said he would meet us in Lhasa. My battery is dead. I can't call him. You said Director Jiang would pick us up. Go ahead and argue about it! -I'm going back! -Thupten! Thupten! Thupten! Droma! Kelsang! Don't let him go! Let me go. -Thupten! -Don't get angry. Come on! Go with us! Thupten! I never wanted to be on TV anyway. I'm just your guide. Now I can only see from one eye. Maybe I'll even lose sight in that eye tomorrow. If you take us there, you can play my eagle flute. Let me go. -Thupten! -Brother Sonam! -Thupten! -Brother Sonam! -Thupten! -Brother Sonam! -Thupten! -Brother Sonam! Brother Sonam! -Thupten! -Brother Sonam! -Thupten! -Brother Sonam! I need to file a report! What's the problem? Calm down. Slow down. A teacher from a school for the blind and a bunch of kids... Seem to have had an accident. Sorry, who are you? Kelsang, here. Sonam, for you. Where are you going? An arm's length away! To sing on TV. Really? I love singing too. Then why don't you come with us! Yes, you can see. You can take us there. I can see too! Didn't you say you weren't going? Thupten, let Wangdu take us there. Okay? You go with him. I don't want to go anymore. Thupten, Don't get angry. Let's all go together. I'm going back. Thupten! Thupten, Thupten, Thupten! Thupten, Thupten, Thupten! Thupten, Thupten! Thupten, Thupten, Thupten! Thupten! You can't just leave like this. You're came together as a group You should all stay together as a group. Isn't that right? Thupten's always changing his mind. Wangdu can take you there. I can't go. I have to look after my cattle. My father said... When they're grazing... You must not lose a single cow. It's the same for you. You must stick together too. I can hear a plane. No! NO, that's not a plane! It's a tank! Thupten! What can you see? Tell us! Are you going to rob us? Do you want to rob us? Where are you going? We're going to Lhasa. We are going in a different direction. Is this you in the photo? Look at it carefully. Yes it is. Chief! We just spotted a group of motorcycle bikers carrying some kids. They just crossed over the Lhasa bridge. They'll arrive in the city very soon. Let's go! Lhasa! Lhasa! Which one of you is Teacher Nymda? I'm not teacher Nymda. My name is Sonam. You did a good impression! I can play the piwang ''Tibetan fiddle''. I'm Droma. I can sing. I'm Kelsang. I can play the eagle flute. I'm Thupten. I'm their guide. Teacher Nymada is coming! Run! Where are you going? Get out of the way! Move to the side! Where are you going? Mount Everest! Why are you here? It's the wrong way. We brought the kids here! Come on! Go! The police are going to arrest us! Do you have any free lawyers here? You can't arrest us. We're just kids! Let's discuss this some more. We can't go. How can I change your mind? In Tibet... there are many kids who can sing. But your kids really want to go. Why are you taking them? Because you feel sorry for these blind kids? Because if they sing more people will watch your show? How can you say that? I just want to cure Thupten's eye. He's about to lose sight in that eye. I want to go! What are you saying? You're going back with me. But we're already in Lhasa! I'm not going back! Neither am I! You have to go back! Wait! Not so fast! Come on. Give it some more thought! The kids want to sing. It's their dream. I'm their teacher! We should help kids make their dreams come true! A piano! I'll give you a piano. What? Are you trying to bribe me? Here, look! I meanlisten! Has the plane taken off? I don't know. It's just as noisy as riding on a Harley Davidson. There are so many clouds out there. I saw clouds before. They're fluffy like cotton. White and soft. All different kinds of shapes. After we arrive in Shenzhen, where do you want to go? I can take you around. I've been Shenzhen. Really? Where else have you been? Well, I went to Europe. And America too. I see, Then let's talk about TV. Maybe you don't know much about TV stations. I've been on TV before. What are you in charge of at the TV station? Well.. just about everything. But mainly I have to look after the performers. We're as high as the clouds and the snow-covered mountains. Director Jiang, how high are we flying? We're about ten thousand meters up. How high is ten thousand meters? Ten thousand meters? As high as ten thousand of you. Wow, it's so hot! It feels so sticky and the air smells salty. You're now by the ocean. Wow, the ocean! As big as a washbowl! There are so many houses. I also see so many boats. Really? What else? And so many cars! Big ones and small ones! So many I've never seen before! Hey kids, welcome to Shenzhen. Has the director been getting impatient? I don't know. Hey kids! Desire to Sing Now your dreams are going to come true! Here's a pear for you. Thanks! Stop it! Stop! Same as before! Cancel this act! Hi, Director... I'm back. Hey, are they able to sing now? -Of course. -Okay, let's hear you sing! Okay. Ready, kids! Don't be shy. You'll be great. The director's here with you now. Impress her! But aren't you the director? Try your best！ We are going to be on TV, right? Yes, you'll be on TV. You can give me your canes. Get ready! Where is the director? Over here. Get ready! Start! Spin to the right the way a peacock turns, Spin to the left the way a laughing thrush turns, -Kelsang, let me play the flute. -No! I want to be on TV. Thupten! Spinning, spinning to the left, a silver ring you'll win. Thupten! Kelsang! Stop! Only her. It's all Thupten's fault. Why'd you grab my eagle flute! You promised me I could play it. We're already in Shenzhen! Stop arguing! Brother Sonam didn't sing. He just wanted us to sing. Droma was also wrong She left us and went on TV by herself. Boss... I understand. More people will watch this program. Don't worry. We know how to promote it. Director. Please let all of my kids perform on TV. Boss, I need to take care of a matter here. May I call you back a bit later? Director... Please let my kids all perform on TV together. They came together as a group. Yesterday, Director Jiang promised us they could. He's the director? I'm sorry. We have certain rules on our program. I can't make an exception. Hey, director! Okay, then... I don't need that piano. What piano? Come quick. This way please. What a fantastic performance from the last group! Coming up next is a very special contestant. A blind girl who has come all the way from Tibet. Please welcome... Our next contestant to the stage, Droma! What's wrong with her? Hey, what's the matter with her? Move on to the next group of contestants! Droma, what happened? Droma, what happened? What's the matter? Droma! Focus the spotlight... To the marked spot on the stage. Director, please give her another chance. I know they have a special situation. What do they want? I can try to help them out so they get what they want. They just wish to perform on TV. I already gave them a chance. She didn't sing. What can I do about it! Droma! Droma! Let's go back! It was my fault we fell apart as a group. In the city, those with sight could be just as lost as the blind. Even though sister Droma was blind, Her heart knew this world even better. Why didn't you sing? We are just like that herd of cows. What cows? Just like Wangdu's cows. Who is Wangdu? Wangdu was right. A single cow must not leave its herd. The four of us came together as a group. If I'm the only one to sing on stage... It's not right. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. It's not your fault. If they want to sing, they can sing anywhere. Let's go back! In the past... I participated in a piano competition. I came in first place. But I thought... Someone else deserved to come in first. I only won because I was blind. Too much sympathy is the same as prejudice. Maybe... You're being too sensitive. Just like these sunglasses you wear. You don't really need them at all. But wearing them is just a habit. It's a way of protecting yourself. No, that's not right. The reason you wear sunglasses... Is also... So that others... Can't see the expression in your eyes. In this way... We're all just the same. We all live together in the same world. Look at them, They're so happy now. They're so carefree. Sometimes, We should be more like children ourselves. The ocean! So salty! It really is salty. The ocean! As big as a washbowl! The ocean! Thupten! I'm right here! Look inside and you can see a world beyond your eyes. Let me see. Where is it? I want to see. -Let me see first. -Let me see! Stop it! Stop it! -Let me see first! -Let me see! Kelsang, what happened? Kelsang! What happened? Why are you grabbing it? -You can't even see. -I can see! What are they saying? Red! Yellow! Green! White！ Really? Can you see anything? Yes, I can! I can see myself playing the eagle flute! Thupten? I can't see anything! -Thupten! -I can't see anything! Thupten! What happened to him? Why can't he see now? We'll do the operation today. Dr. Zhang, thanks for making a special trip here. Sure, don't mention it. Who's there? Kelsang. I promised when we arrived in Shenzhen... I'd let you play my eagle flute. I'm giving it to you now. I don't want it. I don't know how to play it. My grandfather and father were both blind. We can all play the eagle flute. I'll teach you how to play too. After your eyes are fixed, Let's go home together. We all know... daylights is very long in Tibet. Ultraviolet light is very strong. Therefore the prevalence of cataracts is very high. It's also hereditary. In the examination this time... We found the cataract crystals had shifted in Thupten's eye. When we had examined him several days ago... This had not yet occurred. It must have been caused by some external factor. Can you tell me... Did anything recently happen to Thupten? He... He did roll down the hill on his trip here. They said their cart had flipped over. Dr. Zhang... The operation will be successful, right? If he doesn't have the operation now... Then he'll go completely blind, right? Yes, that's right. Very soon. What's the chance this operation will be successful? I'm afraid it's hard to say. Thupten needs this operation immediately. I want to think it over. What? If... If it's really so risky... Then it's better for him not to have surgery. Although we're blind... We can get used to it. If he has some hope... But then the operation fails, That's just too cruel for a young boy. I want to see. I want to see again. I want the operation. Nymda... Is there anything else I can do to help? You've already done a lot for them. Thank you so much, Director Jiang. Don't keep calling me "director." Actually... I'm just a director's assistant. I'm just a loser. You truly wanted to help the kids. I can feel that from my heart. Director Jiang... Let's play a game, okay? Squat down. Keep walking. No peeking. What does it feel like? Well... Do you feel scared? I... Keep on walking. Before I was five I could still see. Just like you. How does it feel? If that's how you felt your whole life... What would you do? But I'm not blind. You told me to bring them here. It's already so late! I know. Today Thupten's only eye... went blind. They're not looking for sympathy. They just want to be given a chance. A single cow must not leave its herd. Do you feel scared? We all live together in the same world. I don't need that piano. Droma, what happened? Was it a bunch of kids who got in touch with you? Or was it a teacher? Please let my kids all perform on TV together. You're all done with the prep work, right? There was another one like that, I remember. Good evening ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to Shenzhen TV's "Desire to Sing". Next is a group of very talented children. Their hearts are so pure and innocent. I believe during their performance... You will be moved... By their determination. Welcome the next group of contestants to the stage! These contestants standing next to me... have come from a place very faraway. They are from the snow-capped mountains... more than a thousand miles away. Because of their dream... Even the highest mountains... Couldn't stop them from being here tonight. Now let's hear more about their dream! What is their dream? Here, Sister Droma. I'm Droma. I... We come from a school for blind children in Tibet. We want to perform on TV... To show that blind people... can do more than weave at home... or only give massages.. or repeat day after day at a school for the blind. We just want... Everyone to see that we can sing. We want to dedicate this song... To our best friend Thupten. We hope he'll be able to see this world again. Brother Sonam? Now let's give the stage to our contestants. Let's listen to their song form Tibet. Director, you were looking for me ? This is your act. You give the signal. Me? I'm giving you a chance. Thank you, director! Everybody please get ready! Action! Tibetan azalea, your radiance is eternal like the sun. White Tibetan hada, flowing eternal like the Yangtze River. Under the snow-covered mountains, we all keep warm together. On the Tibetan plateau, our dream is to touch heaven. I pray for you to see the light again. I pray for you to recover soon. I pray to see your bright smile again. I pray you'll forever be our eyes.
