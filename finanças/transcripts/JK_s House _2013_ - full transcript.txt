Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [no audible dialog] {JK narrating] Welcome to JK's house. Hi, I'm JK, and that's my mom, Dr. Amber Jenkins. Thank you for helping me with the groceries. You have such great manners. Mom is always busy being a doctor, and she has tons of rules. [sighs] JK, is that your sister Alex? I think so. Mm-hmm. Would you please go upstairs and tell her to come downstairs and help us unpack the groceries before the guests come? Yes, ma'am. JK, no running. Yes, ma'am. See what I mean? No running, no laughing, no playing, no fun. [door opens] That's my grandpa. He says he can fix anything and out-dance anyone. All he needs is a toolbox and dancing shoes. Thought I heard something out here. Well, how's my favorite daughter? Mom's his favorite daughter, but we all know who his favorite person is. Look, how about this dance, shall we? No, Dad, I don't have time for this. My book club meeting is starting in a minute. Mom wishes he would take it easy, but Grandpa wishes Mom would have more fun. Come on, you don't want to dance with your old man? That's the only dance move Mom knows. I hate it. Let me show you what my move is. Oh, my-- One more turn. There we go. Okay. Now watch me move. Oh, Dad. Let's go in the house. Come on, inside. You don't want to dance with your old man. No, Dad. That's all right. [chuckles] {JK narrating] That's Alex, my big sister. Cheerleading is her life. Hey, guys. Hey, mom. Well, hello, cheerbabies. She and her friends practice all the time, and I mean always. So Alex, what the rule about having company over? I know, Mom, but we really had to practice our routine. Alex. No company over unless you're home. {JK narrating] Our friends barely get to have fun when Mom's here. But since you guys are here, can you run out and grab the groceries? My book club meeting starts at 6:00. {JK narrating] See? Everybody does chores here, even other people's children. Grandpa, didn't the doctor say take it easy? Take it easy? I'm going to make you mop this floor. I'll take that as a no. Grandpa. Don't run in the house, baby. No running! [woman singing, blues music] Come here. Did you get me anything for my birthday? Now you know grandpa don't dance and tell. Can't do that. That's Grandma. I haven't seen him move like that since 1932. Or is it 1392? Baby, when was it that you broke your hip? She thinks Grandpa is too old to be doing so much. JK. Come over here and give your grandma some sugar. JK, you know what? I think our company is going to be coming soon, so why don't you go and finish your chores? {JK narrating] Finishing chores is the most important thing ever. She said the chore word. [Grandma] Let us know if you need anything else, dear. She would home school us if she could, just so we can be around to do more chores. Mom's book club is today, so the house has to be extra clean, and us kids have to be extra quiet. [doorbell] Coming, coming! I hope we don't make too much noise. [door opens] You can start the party without me. He means we can't start the drama. I'm Tyler. I'm ready to party! Every day is a party in his mind. And who is this fine, lovely lady? Oh, I am Dr. Amber Jenkins, and I am pleased to meet you. I don't know if a book club meeting is a party, but I'm happy to meet you, you party animal. [boy] Nice to have you in the neighborhood, Doc. Mom. Yes, yes, honey. Can we go upstairs and finish practicing? We are done in the kitchen. Please, Dr. Jenkins? Only a few weeks until the competition, and Kim here needs all the practice she can get. Kim? The whole squad needs practice. I mean, just-- a little quiet guys, quiet. Hoo, hoo, hoo. Hey, James. {JK narrating] He only comes for the food. James, you are not eating the food. Welcome to JK's house, where manners rule. Someone needs to tell that to my dad. What? Hey, guys. [crowd greeting each other] Hey, guys. Want to see something cool? [kids agree] Follow me. The guacamole is great. I made it just for you, James. All right. Oh, have a seat. Great. [singing] My name is James. What? My name is James. What? {JK narrating] Maybe Mr. James should be upstairs helping with the cheer squad. Hey, James. Thank you. Thank you for that wonderful ice breaker. Thank you. Did everybody bring their book? I sure did. James, that's not the book. Oh, yeah, yeah. Cliff Notes version of How To Be a Successful Mother. Yeah, I read the whole thing. Where should we start? At the beginning. Oh, chapter one. [whimsical dance music] Hey, you want to make up a song with me? [kids agree] [all kids] One, two, one, two three! * Listen to the rhythm Listen to the beat * * Introduce yourself on the count of three * One, two, one, two, three! * My name is JK * I like to dance. My name is Max. I like to beat. My name is Tyler. Honey, I am the man. The man playing a crayon. One, two, one, two, three! * Listen to the rhythm Listen to the beat * * Introduce yourself on the count of three * One, two, one, two, three! What do you like to do, Leah? Um, I don't know. [JK narrating] She's got to be kidding me. Well, not really. I like to-- [all] She likes to-- I like to-- [all] She likes to-- [JK narrating] She likes to mess up our songs. [all] Come on, Leah! Come on, Leah! [cell phone ringing] Hello? Okay, guys, I got to go. It's my agent. [JK narrating] His agent can smell drama. [sobbing] I just realized... my emotional ups and downs are tied to my childbearing. Okay, James? I'm quite certain it was your wife, Alyssa, who did the childbearing. Not you. Then why am I having contractions? [Alyssa] Hello? Hello, James? Guacamole dip. You're on your third helping. That's-- [stomach growls] Bathroom? Upstairs, James. Thank you. Yes. Oh, my gosh. He really does bring up a good point, though. If you think about what we were talking about in the beginning of the book, [banging] Did you guys hear that? Yeah. I think it's JK and her friends making a lot of noise. Excuse me for one minute. And I will check on your husband. Oops, it looks like we did make too much noise. JK! We were having so much fun... we didn't notice my Mom at all. JK! Mom, you're supposed to say "Excuse me." Excuse me. You're supposed to be using your inside voices, guys. So everybody do everything just a little more softly. Okay, Max? On the drums. Kennedy, a little softer on the tambourine, all right? [kids shouting] Yes, Dr. Jenkins. [JK narrating] Rock stars can't be quiet. It's time to move this party outside. Want to go outside? Yeah! Let's go outside! [JK narrating] She can't tell us no running when company is over. [James] Oh, man. I thought I was going to fall in there for a second. [JK narrating] I hope it's not my day to clean the bathroom. [man singing] Really, I hope you had a good time. So if we just meet back here at the same time next Thursday? Yes? Okay? Perfect. [whispers] Maybe James won't come. Just kidding. Shall we? Think so. [JK narrating] My friends and I love to play outside. We can be loud and run around as much as we want. Manners rule inside, but fun rules outside. That face means her grass is ruined. That was a funny day, huh? Yes, ma'am. Did you have a good time? Yes, ma'am. You know, I think that we should talk about your birthday party. I can have a sleepover? Okay, I don't know about that. I mean, it's a little hectic around here with us just moving in. Plus, Mommy is trying to expand her business. She gets to work from home. Why did we have to move here anyways, especially on my birthday. Excuse me, young lady. I think that you should be a little more thankful. I mean, it's not everyday that you get a new house, and new friends, right? I guess you're right. I think I am right. And I think I'm right about you having to go to bed. It's pretty late. Okay? All right. I'll come up and kiss you goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, you guys already set the table for Mom. It looks great. Just remember that the glasses always go above the knives, and the knife should point towards the plate. [Grandpa] I knew that. Huh? Yes, Grandpa. Come on. Let's you and I go outside and play. There you go. Good girl. Let's go. What do you want to play today, huh? You want to jump rope? Yes. Okay. [Leah] Want to jump rope with me? No, not really. What's wrong? Tomorrow is my birthday, and I'm not having a slumber party. Oh. What were you whispering about yesterday? I can't tell you. It's a secret. But you told everyone else. I know, but I can't tell you, JK. Why not? JK, you got to trust me. We're best friends, remember? I don't want to play anymore. Hey, that wasn't very nice. That's not like her at all. It's okay. I got to go home and do my homework anyway. See you later, Dr. Jenkins. Bye, Leah. [JK narrating] Grandma decided to give me a talk during snack time. I hate living here. Leah and the other kids don't like me. My dear, I think you're mistaken. What makes you say something like that? Well, when they were over here yesterday, I think they were whispering about me. Now, did you ask? Of course. Well... I think you need to ask again. Ask again? [JK narrating] What's that going to do? But this time, really listen. [JK narrating] Maybe she's right. I don't think this is about Leah, anyway, is it? No, I was hoping to have a slumber party. JK, stop worrying. What you need to do is just learn to be a little more thankful for the things you already have. No friends, no sleepover? Yes, ma'am. Yep, I'm thankful all right. Think about it, sweetie. Things could always be worse. [JK narrating] Worse? How could things get worse? It might take a little bit of time for my patients-- [JK narrating] A cupcake? That's my birthday breakfast ? Mom, is this for me? Shh, honey, I'm on the phone. Oh, strawberry icing. [JK narrating] No, she did not just steal my birthday cupcake. Whose birthday? Mine. Well, congratulations, kiddo, but we're trying to practice. Stay out of the way. [JK narrating] No way. They're so busy, they forgot my birthday? JK, why don't you go in the living room, okay? Yes, ma'am. It's going to be a great idea. So you want to go another round, you sore loser? I'm only a sore loser because you cheated. This is why grandparents shouldn't play video games. Beating you is easier than baking an apple pie. I do not have to cheat. I know they will remember my birthday. Did you come for my birthday party, or did you forget, too? Birthday? Whose birthday? JK's. Don't you remember? Who's JK? I'm JK. Oh, someone has an attitude here. But don't worry. Let me get my tool belt. Not having a slumber party doesn't mean you can't still have fun with your family, right? I guess you're right. Things could always be worse. Whoa, she was right. Come here, my little sweetheart. I'm so proud of you. My little angel is turning seven. Daddy, I wish I could be more like you and Mom. Well, couldn't nobody out-dance me and your mom. Daddy, you know that's not what I mean. I mean, I-- I really like being a doctor, but sometimes I think I'm not there enough for the kids. But you are. You're teaching them that with a little elbow grease, they can accomplish anything. I guess you're right. Yeah. You know, the truth is that... you're just not taking time out for yourself. You're just like a little hammer. You're just pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding away. You don't take time to get polished. You know what, Daddy? I think that you could solve all the world's problems from right there, that tool belt. Yeah, that's right, Dr. Jenkins. With a set of tools and a few dance moves, shoot, I could fix anything. [JK narrating] The world? I just hope he can fix my birthday. [phone ringing] Hello, JK's residence. Well, happy birthday, JK. Hi, Grandma! You remembered. You know I could never forget about you, JK. I guess you're right. I was hoping to have a slumber party, but Mom said no. It's okay, though. It could definitely be worse. That's the spirit, my little angel. Listen, tell your mom... [JK narrating] Okay, Grandma remembers, but I wonder if anyone else does. Okay, bye. Happy birthday, my big girl. [JK narrating] Here comes Mom. Uh-oh. I forgot to clean something, didn't I? And part of growing up is learning to be grateful for the things you do have. Leah is here. I guess you're right. Yeah? [Leah] Are you still mad at me? No, I'm sorry about yesterday, Leah. Best friends? Yeah, best friends. Are you ready to hear the secret? No, it's okay. You're my best friend. Come on. I can't wait to show you this. [JK narrating] I wonder what the secret is. Bye. Happy Birthday, JK! [JK narrating] Whoa! All of my friends are here. They remembered. This is going to be the best party ever. This is the big secret we were whispering about. [cheering, dancing to pop music] Happy birthday, JK! [cheering] [pop music resumes] [JK narrating] We rocked out all day. This definitely beats a slumber party. We even had a magician. You've got a big cake, but can I make you a special cake? Yeah! A very special cake. Now I know you all are going to say this is not magic water, but really, this is invisible water. Invisible water? I'm seven, not three. It is completely, completely invisible. Now, what? I saw the lid. I saw it. You evidently was not looking when I hypnotized everybody. Look back at it. Now look very carefully. The water is completely invisible. Now, once we get the water in there, we have to use a little fire. Now, kids at home, do not try this trick. Fire is very dangerous. It can burn you, because it burns me all the time. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to get it going at about 350 degrees. Once you get it going, you take-- [children] No! [children shouting] Yeah, y'all just seeing things. I don't know what the problem is. Now we have to use a top. What kind of cake y'all like? [children] Chocolate! Everybody to count to five. Ready? One, two, three, four, five. Abracadabra! Ta-da! [children cheer] I wanted to keep the bunny as a present, but Mom said no. Misty the Magic Rabbit! [children cheering] [JK narrating] What if you trade Alex? Grandpa said a party just isn't a party without a soul train line. I hope Grandpa doesn't hop in and throw out his hip again. That was a nice day. Did you learn about anything today, guys? I did. You did? To be grateful. For what you have, hmm? Yep. I think the most important thing is just the friends and family that you have, that you love, you know? It's not about the material things or who has the most. You know? It's kind of like who has the most love, right? And the most friends. Yes, ma'am. And I've got the prettiest girls in the world. I'm happy about that. I had the most fun at the party. And I love you. I love you, too. My sister is the typical teenager. Clothes, boys, cheer, and dances rule her life. That is so pretty. I know. My mom would never let me wear something like that. Why not? It's not too revealing. Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't you call your mom, and you ask her if you can wear that. Well, being that I'm partial to seeing the light of day, how about no? Whatever. Alex has a dance coming up, and she's been looking for the perfect dress for weeks. Oh, Summer, Summer, look at this one. Oh, my gosh, Alex. That's it. That's your dress. Oh. Oh, no. $348? Where am I going to get that kind of money from? [JK narrating] If she sells her whole closet, she could get the money. The boys always want to play sword fighting games. Us girls like to play calmer games, like tea party and dress up. Hey, guys. Want to play dress up? I do. Me, too. You're at the edge of my sword, Tyler. Nonsense, Sir Maximus. Soon you'll fall, and I'll take the ladies from your evilness. Boys, we want to play dress up, and you're in the way. [JK narrating] I wish he would save us from this craziness. It's a girls' room. No! No! Well, fine, but if you want to stay, then... you're going to have to play dress up, too. [JK narrating] Boys? Playing dress up? This should be fun. Well, we warned you. [woman singing] [kids chanting] Algerian, Syrian, Lithuanian, Romanian, * We all pray for a better tomorrow * * Hebrew, Aborigine * We all laugh in the same language * [chanting] Alsatian, Croatian, Russian, Prussian * Our hearts beat in the same rhythm * [chanting] Hopi, Cherokee, Navajo, Seminole. * We all love in the same language * [chanting] American, Canadian, Mexican, Arcadian. [children shouting] Hey, that's not like JK not to clean up after herself. [JK narrating] Mom wanted to spend more time at home, so she decided to talk to her patients on her computer screen. [computer beeping] Hey, sounds like the health monitoring system is working. [man] Amber, are you there? James? Alyssa, honey, how do you get this webcam working? James? James, can you hear me? Amber, I hear you. Where-- where are you? I'm right here, James. Just a little down and to the left. Down? Yeah, keep coming a little bit lower. Okay, okay. Hey! Hey! There you are. Hi, James. This webcam thing really works pretty good, huh? Yeah, it works. Can you hear me? Yes, I can, James. Loud and clear. I was doing some yardwork, and I caught a rash. So, you know, that sounds like an allergy. I'm usually not allergic to doing the yard. I'm usually-- Yeah, but James, allergies can just sort of pop up anytime. I'm betting that it's poison ivy or poison oak. Oh, I've heard of that. Yeah. So what do we do? All right, so tell me. Was it, um-- is it four leaves or five? Do you remember? I think it was four. Okay, so that's poison ivy. So I will just send a prescription via email. In the meantime, no scratching or anything, okay? Because I don't want it to spread. Yeah, I gotcha. Say hi to Alyssa for me, your beautiful wife. Bye-bye. It will be fine. Yeah, it will be all right. Bye, James. Bye. [clears throat] Hey, Mom. Hey, honey. [clears throat] [JK narrating] Looks like Alex has a plan for her dress. Allie, this is going to-- Before you say anything, I know the dress is expensive, but... Summer and I have already come up with a plan. She's decided to split her babysitting shifts with me. [JK narrating] Summer must either be a good friend or really weird. He said I could tutor there on Saturdays. I'm impressed. You're taking all this initiative, and doing this on your own. Very good. Hey, bye, guys. See you later. [JK narrating] Oh, my gosh. My mom is going to be so mad. I've got to get this cleaned up before she sees it. Hey, JK, I wanted to know if you wanted some cookies. [JK narrating] Uh-oh, too late. Maybe she won't notice? Oh, my God. Okay, JK, what were you thinking? You have all the clothes out of your closet. Every book off the shelf. What were you doing in here? [JK narrating] Never mind. You've got to be kidding me. You've got a trash can. Why do you have this on the floor? [JK narrating] I didn't do this by myself. Gosh, what is this? [JK narrating] So that's where my sticky green glue went. You and I are going to have a talk. [JK narrating] Oh, great. Now I'm going to get it. Come. Listen to me. You can't make a mess like this. Do you understand? You have better manners than this, young lady. All right? I am going to help you clean this room, but the next time you make a mess like this, you are cleaning it up all by yourself, do you understand me? [JK narrating] Oh, I understand. This is why boys should never, ever play dress up. Okay, let's start. You get the books. I'll get the clothes. Yes, ma'am. [scoffs] [woman singing It's a Perfect Day ] Oh, God, it's so hot out there. Hey, Mom. I think this is the last bunch. Are those the flowers for the neighborhood plant association sale? Yes, ma'am. And aren't they beautiful? Yes, they really are. Hey, Mom. Hey, sweetie. Kiss. Good-bye. Hey, Grandma. Hey, baby. See you later. Bye. She has been in and out like that all week long, just trying to earn enough money to buy a particular dress for the spring formal. It costs over $300. $300. $300. You know? Your father once wanted this tool set that cost about $300 years ago. What happened? He bought my wedding ring, instead. Oh, smart man! He better have. Tool set. Tool set. [JK narrating] Grandpa loves to tell stories, and he's always teaching us new things. And when the sunshine come out, they will grow into a nice, big watermelon. [both] Wow! I want you to raise your right hand and repeat after me. All right. I, your name, [both] I, your name. No, no, no. Your name, your name, okay? Let's try it again. I, your name. I, JK. I, Leah. Surely do promise. Surely do promise. To shimsham in the sunshine. To shimsham in the sunshine. And to du-wop in the dirt. And to du-wop in the dirt. [JK narrating] We know he's making it up, but we just pretend to make him feel better. Congratulations, girls. You are now the newest members of the super goddess club. How about that? All right. [man singing "Morning Has Come"] [JK narrating] Alex had to work really hard to pay for her dress. I didn't think she had it in her, but she and Summer babysat, and they both worked hard. Well, we're just kind of babysitting. [JK narrating] They were tired, but were able to make a lot of money. Great, what did I do with my keys? Oh, okay. Amber? You guys are back from the mall already? So babysitting treated you well, I take it. It was actually kind of fun. And we got to work on our cheer routines while babysitting. Good job, but that's not the pink dress you wanted. Well, I couldn't save enough money, so I had to go with my second choice. I got a different dress, too. That way I could afford the matching shoes. Matching shoes. I'm proud of you guys. Matching shoes. Good job. [JK narrating] Meanwhile, our guessing game wasn't going so well. [boy] That is a dinosaur. Is that a cactus? [all laugh] I don't know what that blue thing is, but that is a monkey fish frog. Okay, it is, um-- It's one of those snakes that go [biting sound] And they go ps-ssssss. No, Tyler, it's a rabbit. [JK narrating] Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner. Come on, guys. Let's go jump rope outside. First we need to clean up in here, and then we can. Didn't your mom just leave? We'll clean up later. [JK narrating] Clean up later? They must not know my mom. If we don't clean up, I'm going to be in big trouble. But playing outside does sound like fun. Oh, well. Wait for me. [woman singing] [JK narrating] Tyler has officially lost his mind. [silly noises] [JK narrating] Is he crazy? That's Alex's dress. You shouldn't play with Alex's dress. JK, go for a pass. Remember the rules? Yeah, JK's house, where manners rule. So join the fun with me. Hey, Max. JK, Alex's dress! My God. Look at what you guys did. [JK narrating] Oh, my God is right. I think it's time for me to head home, now. Yeah, uh... Yeah, I'm going to just, uh... [JK narrating] Now he has nothing to say? Yeah, uh... Bye. [JK narrating] Oh, no, they didn't. How am I supposed to clean this up? What do I do? JK, what's all the commotion in here? [JK narrating] Uh-oh, Grandma's coming. Board games? Really? I could have swore I heard a lot of noise. Yeah, really. Why is this place such a mess? You're supposed to clean up behind yourselves. We can explain. Yeah, we can. Kennedy kept wanting to play ball, but she-- Well, do you think Kennedy's house looks like this? Guess not. I guess not. You're supposed to do what you know is right. Yes, Grandma. That way, you don't risk getting in trouble. Yes, Grandma. Now I suggest you two clean up this mess before your mom gets home. [both] Yes, ma'am. [JK narrating] That was a close one. Now about that dress... We tried everything we could to fix that dress. Wite-out, crayons, even paint, but nothing really worked. That looks better, doesn't it? It doesn't. Oh, no, my sister is going to kill me. [JK narrating] If Grandma doesn't get me first. Oh, no. I didn't mean to. She didn't mean to. It was a complete mistake. Your sister is going to be so upset. What do I do? I know one thing. That stain is not coming out. I have to buy her a new dress, but I don't have any money. Me, neither. I guess I'll have to help. [JK narrating] Thank goodness for Grandma. We can have a bake sale. We'll do it when we have the plant sale. Oh, thanks, Grandma. But you're going to have to work very, very hard. Whatever it takes. Good, because first, you have to march out there and tell your sister what you did. [JK narrating] Is she crazy? I just turned seven. I'd like to turn eight, too. [JK narrating] Alex is out there breaking it down. I just hope she doesn't break me down when she finds out about this dress. Well, hello, girls. Hey. Yeah. A-Alex? [JK narrating] If I back out now, I can be in China before she finishes practicing, right? What's up, JK? I have something to tell you and it's not good. [JK narrating] I've got to tell her now. What do you mean? Well... I spilled a glass of fruit juice, and I ruined your new dress. You what? You ruined my new dress. Yes, it was a complete mistake. Do you realize how hard I worked to get that dress, JK? How could you? It can be fixed. I'll make it up to you. [scoffs] I will never forgive you, JK. [JK narrating] I felt horrible about Alex's dress and wouldn't leave my room. Mom decided to come and give me a pep talk. [JK sobbing] Sweetie, do you want to talk about it? No. Okay. Well, what do you plan to do? I'll never be able to come up with enough money to buy Alex's dress in time. No, no, no. I think that's nonsense. No, even if you don't, I think it's much more important to take responsibility for your actions. But I didn't spill the juice on the dress. It was Kennedy, Tyler, and Max. Oh, Kennedy, Tyler, and Max, huh? Hmm. Well, you know what? Sit up. Kennedy, Tyler, and Max were guests of JK at JK's house. Yes. Mm-hmm. But I tried to stop them. I guess I didn't try hard enough. Well, I think it's very important to be a leader, you know. And you've got to lead well and let other people follow you in doing the right thing. And certainly, you should never follow them in doing the wrong thing. I think we should get some sleep. We have got a big day ahead of us. We? You said that the next time I made a mess, I had to clean it all up by myself. Yes, I did say that. But you are going to need all the help you can get. [JK narrating] Mom's not strict all the time. Actually, she can be pretty nice. What would I do without her? Definitely not chores. [woman singing "Imagine All Your Tears"] [no audible dialog] [no audible dialog] Okay, you all ready to work? I have the flour. Good. I have the sugar. And when life serves you lemons... make lemonade! [JK narrating] Grandma, Leah, and I quickly got to work making cookies for the bake sale. You got it, Leah? Okay, that's enough, that's enough. Good. [JK narrating] Grandma is a good teacher and we had fun baking with her. [all] ...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. [Grandma] It's mixed up. I need to know where is the milk? Would you stop walking around with that sign? I need some milk. Milk? There's the milk, Grandma. And that's going to be smoother. Smooth. Can I do it? Can I do it? Yes, okay. One... good. Be careful. T-two... Spread them out, not too close. Three... Not too close. We have to separate them. Here we go. Open up the oven. Be careful, JK. It's hot. Thank you. You're welcome. Watch your hand. It's hot. [JK narrating] Our cookies started selling like crazy. We began making money in no time. [Grandpa] Is that the last of the cookies? Yep, last set. Only $3 for two cookies. But we still need $50. This here is the last of the cookies, right? That's it. That's the last one. Yes. These cookies are as good as they want to be. Look, you know what? I could eat these cookies all day long. But I'll tell you what. I'll give you $3 for one. I'll give you $7. Fifteen, fifteen. Come on, you know these cookies smell good. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to give you $25. How about that? Thirty-five. $50. Mr. James could probably go without a few cookies. We did it! [JK narrating] Thanks to Grandma and Grandpa, we were able to get all the money we needed. You take the twenties, I'll take the others. Okay. Okay, girls. We have to hurry. The stores close at 6:00. We have plenty of money. We did it. Let's go. We did it! We did it! Come on, girls. Hurry. [cell phone rings] -Hello? -Hey. Hey, Summer. Are you sure you won't go, Alex? I have a dress you can borrow. It's not as nice as the other, but... You don't understand. I worked so hard for that dress, and now it's ruined. It wouldn't be the same. Okay, stay there. I'll be right over . [JK narrating] Alex was still upset about her dress, but we had something that would cheer her up. Haven't you done enough already? Thanks to Grandpa... we had more than enough money... to buy the dress... that you really wanted. [all] Ta-da! Oh, my God. Summer, look. It's your dress! JK? I'm sorry that I ruined your dress, Alex. [gasps] And what else? Looks like we won't be playing at the house anymore. That's right. Come on, Alex. Let me help you put this beautiful dress on. And I've got a camera, okay? I want to take a picture of you in that dress. Go upstairs, guys. Go, go, go. [JK narrating] Alex looked beautiful in her dress. She couldn't believe we actually got the one she wanted. I'm glad she's not mad at me anymore. [man singing pop music] [JK narrating] She and her friends had fun. [dance music] I had a nice day with you girls. Did you learn any lessons today? Yeah, I learned how to forgive. And what did you learn, JK? I learned how to clean my room. All right, you know? And how about overall to take responsibility for your actions? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's a big one. Learning that lesson will carry you far. I love you guys. [JK narrating] I learned a lot about responsibility. Okay, let's try that. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. [JK narrating] Alex and her friends were busy practicing for cheer, like always. It's high V, low T. That looks like a fun routine. We're actually choreographing a routine for our Junior Pep Squad tryouts next week. Junior Pep Squad? Yeah, it's where little girls just like you get to dance and cheer with us. Cool, can I try out? It's pretty competitive. You'd have to work really hard. Then you'd have to ask Mom to sign a permission slip. I could do it. Here's a list of the things you have to know by next week. Okay. Leah and I wonder why they practice so much. ...seven, eight. Come on crowd, let's shout it out. I couldn't wait to ask Mom about joining the Junior Pep Squad. This new site is-- Mom. Oh, honey. I'm just on the phone, okay? [JK narrating] Oh, she's on the phone. We need to speed her up. I just-- I wasn't convinced it was going to work, but now, I don't know, it just seems perfect. Do you know how many calls I'm getting now? Yes, I had the idea... but I had no idea it was going to go off so quickly, you know? I think it all started with my friend James. He went to the site and he signed on and he told somebody and next thing I knew everybody was just there. Okay, so this weekend I'll ask her. I'm sure they'll want to do it. All right, perfect. Thank you so much. Bye. Mom. Bye. Wow, that's impressive. What do you want? [JK narrating] What do I want? Well... Ah... Will you sign this permission slip? Permission slip. All right, so do you understand that this is a lot of responsibility? Yes. And if you make the team, you have to follow through. I promise. Okay, then I think it will be good for you to learn something new. The answer is yes. Yes! I was going to do whatever it takes to make this pep squad. Go practice or rehearse or do whatever you young cheerleaders do. [JK narrating] Alex isn't the only one who can cheer. Hmm, dirty hands and all. First front kick, the T, High-V... [JK narrating] This list sounds like a video game manual. And something called a herky? I think that's a jump. I don't know what any of this means. And finally, you have to do a tumbling move. Oh, boy. I'm in some serious trouble. What are we going to do? I should be getting home. I told my mama I would be home soon. Don't worry, JK. We'll figure something out. [JK narrating] We? You mean me. Looks like I'm on my own for now. So young lady? Everything going okay up there? Yep, never better. Never better. I was talking to Gary on the phone, and he told me he's going to be really busy this week, a lot of meetings. So he was hoping that his daughter, Jasmine, and maybe play with you and Leah during the day. What do you think? Okay. Okay? I'm counting on you guys to be very, very nice to her. Make her feel all warm and welcome. What do you think? Okay, yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Then go practice, Miss Cheerleader? Yes... [JK narrating] Making this pep squad is going to be harder than I thought. I practiced as hard as I could on my own. Even though I barely know what the words mean, I could try, right? Okay, maybe I should save the split for later. I think I'm getting dizzy. By the end, I was tired. Grandma decided to come up and give me some advice. Cheerleading is harder than I thought. Looks like you could use a little bit of help. What you doing up here by yourself? I wanted to show everybody that I could do it, you know? High V. Blades and Daggers? [JK narrating] I feel like I've been hit with blades and daggers. Do you have any suggestions? Ask your big sister. [JK narrating] Maybe Alex could help? Don't be too proud to ask for her help. You'd better ask your sister. [JK narrating] Guess it couldn't hurt to ask. Yes, ma'am. I hope Grandma is right. Blades, because your arms are like blades, see? Try it. Like this? Right. Now what's next? Something called a herky? Yeah, like this. Now try that. Maybe we should start on how to jump, first. I know how to jump. [sighs] Well... [JK narrating] This herky is going to hurt me. Let me show you how to jump, JK. [doorbell] I couldn't wait to take a break from this practice. I'm not trying to be a Saints cheerleader, Alex. Welcome to our home, Jasmine. Thank you, Dr. Jenkins. My father asked me to tell you that he appreciates the help. Oh, honey, it's my pleasure. We're happy to have you. I heard the doorbell. Hi, you must be JK. I'm Jasmine. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too, Jasmine. JK has been out in the back yard practicing her cheerleading moves. You cheerlead? I love cheerleading. Yep, she's getting ready for tryouts. Can you help me? [JK narrating] Yeah, more help. Well, my dad says I'm more of a mascot type, but I've watched a lot of cheerleading competitions. [JK narrating] Mascot or not, I need all the help I can get. James! What? What's so funny? My tongue is stuck to the freezer. I'm sorry. Do you have your tongue stuck to the fr-- I just wanted to see what would happen. James, James, where is your wife, James. She's not here. Why are you licking the fridge, James? I dared myself to do it. You can't laugh at me. Don't laugh at me. I need help. James, I'm embarrassed to call you my friend. [shrieks] Well, you can do a cartwheel, right? Yeah, but I'm not very good at it. [JK narrating] Here goes nothing. I might be more of a mascot type, too. It's okay. Just keep trying, and I'll help you, too. [JK narrating] I had to get up and try again. [man singing] Hey, so you're going to keep at it, right? Yes, sir. I want you to remember. If you can dance, then you can cheerlead. Does that mean you could cheerlead, too, Grandpa? Grandpa cheerlead? You watch this now. [JK narrating] If Grandpa throws his hip out again, am I in trouble? She's more committed than the rest. She's good, and she's fine. [JK narrating] This is the best thing I've seen all day. Yay, JK! There you go. You remember that, right? [JK narrating] It didn't rhyme, but it did cheer me up a little. I guess I'm not very good at this. Well, what are you good at? What do you mean? My dad always says to do what you're good at, so what are you good at? All sorts of things, but they're just not on this list. Hmm, that gives me an idea. [JK narrating] Jasmine decided to invite her friend Simea over to perform a song. * Oh, yeah * It's Saturday I want to hang out * [JK narrating] I'm not sure how all these people got in my house or who's going to clean up the mess, but this song rocks. * And have a good time * Until the end Oh, yeah * * Got on my glitter kicks * And I'm going to party at JK's all night * * Yeah, this is my favorite song * * I'm full of energy I'm ready to fly * * All night All night * * I won't feel no better till I get this out of me * * Let the beat take control of me * * If you wonder what's wrong I gotta * * You can sit there in the corner Miss one if you wanna * * Me and my friends gonna keep it going * * If you're wondering what's wrong with us * * We got a fever * Form a line * And put your hands in the air * * Oh, yeah * Dance with me Dance with me! * Get up, please * Everybody on your feet * Oh, yeah * I got on my glitter kicks * And I'm going to party at JK's all night * * Yeah, this is my favorite song * * I'm full of energy I'm ready to fly * * All night all night * * I won't feel no better till I get this out of me * * Let the beat take control of me * * If you wonder what's wrong * You can sit there in the corner Miss one if you wanna * * Me and my friends are gonna keep it going * * If you're wondering what's wrong with us? * * We got a fever What's up, everybody? I'm running this show tonight. Now I want everybody to do what I do. * Hands up one leg * Hands up one leg * Hands down two legs * * Hands down two legs * Now spin around. Now spin around. Stall back one time. Stall back one time. I want everybody to grab a partner. This is my favorite part of the song. Everybody get ready. One, two, three here we go! * I won't feel no better till I get this out of me * * Let the beat take control of me * * You wonder what's wrong * You can sit there in the corner Miss this one if you wanna * * Me and my friends gonna keep it going * * If you're wondering what's wrong with us * * We got a fever * I won't feel no better till I get this out of me * * Let the beat take control of me * * If you're wondering what's wrong * * You can sit there in the corner Miss this one if you wanna * * Me and my friends gonna keep it going * * If you're wondering what's wrong with us * * We got a fever [song repeats] See, JK? All you need is courage and confidence. And never give up. So we need to figure out what JK is good at. Yeah, she's a good friend. Thanks, you two, but how would that ever get me on the cheerleading squad? All right, do you understand that this is a lot of responsibility? Yes. If you make the team, you have to follow through. Yes. Yes, I do. I have to be determined in order to make the squad. It's time to step it up a notch. We all worked with Alex, and actually started getting better. Junior Prep Squad, here I come. That's what big sisters are for. Don't be too proud to ask for her help. [no audible dialog] Hey, Jasmine. Hey, Charles. Are you guys enjoying yourselves? Yes, ma'am. We're having a lot of fun. Thanks for having me. Oh, you're welcome. I wish I could entertain you more. I've just been so busy. That's okay. We've been busy ourselves. Really? Yeah, I happened to see a sign on the door. What's going on with that? I really can't say. We're sworn to secrecy. Oh. Can we have some juice? Yeah, you can have some juice. Secrecy, huh? Yeah, I'm good at keeping secrets. My dad says we should do what we're good at. Well, your dad is a very smart man. So he keeps telling me. That's what he's good at. [computer beep] Oh, here, take some food. I'm sorry, guys. I just-- I have to get back to work. It's what I'm good at. Do you have that? Thanks for the juice. You're welcome. See you guys later. {JK narrating] On the day of tryouts, I was very nervous. What if I do something wrong? And up next is Tammy. Okay, Tammy, let's start with a front kick. High V. Are you ready? Low V. I think so. Just do what you practiced. You'll be great. {JK narrating] That girl was pretty good. Maybe I don't have a shot. Up next is JK. {JK narrating] Uh-oh. I hope I don't mess up. I would like to do things a little different. {JK narrating] Okay, time to show them what I can do. That's not our routine. I know, but it's really good. [whispers] Just ask. Shh! She's right. Ask her. Is there something you guys want to ask me? We still didn't know who made the squad, and Alex's lips were sealed. We haven't made the final decisions yet, guys. Sorry. But they were really impressed with your routine. It showed a lot of initiative and personality. But that wasn't the right routine. I know, but.. we still haven't made a decision yet. Sorry. Come on, guys. Let's go upstairs and play. Catch you in a minute. Bye. [JK narrating] She's never going to tell me. What a sister she is. If Alex wouldn't tell, that must have meant one thing. I didn't make the squad. Oh, why the long face? I didn't make the cheerleading squad. Well, did you do your best? Yes, ma'am. Well, your best is always good enough. Did they tell you that you didn't make it? No. Then why you worrying about something that hasn't happened yet? Don't you have some friends to entertain? I do have friends to entertain. And you're good at it, so... go do it, girl! I may not be great at cheerleading, but Grandma is right. Entertaining friends is my thing. [whispers] Yes. Wow, this is going to be great. I know. And JK has been working at this all week. We'd better get this finished, though. We have to be at the school in two hours. I know. Let's hurry. [Grandpa] Hi, girls. Hi, Grandpa. Man, look at our signs. Don't they look good? {JK narrating] Alex and her friends were busy getting ready for the dance performance, and Grandpa had some news. I got bad news, girls. I was just over at the school today, and... we had a water main break in the gym, and... and it's going to take a while to dry out and repair, so... you're going to have to cancel the dance performance today. What? What? No! I'm sorry, girls. I-- You know? I'm just a messenger, all right? I'm sorry. It's okay, Grandpa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got an idea that just might work. Just hang tight now. You know Grandpa will fix it, all right? Just hang tight. I'll be right back. Hey, James. Is your tongue feeling any better? Yeah, it's okay. Oh, wow, it doesn't sound much better. Okay, James, this is what I want you to do. Just try not to talk for 24 hours. This isn't funny. Why are you laughing. This isn't funny. You can eat. Oh, good. Because I'm hungry. What do you think? Well, I think if my Grandpa says he can fix something, he'll fix it. I hope so. I'd hate to cancel everything. I just wonder what's taking so long. Good news, girls. Your mother just agreed to have the dance performance right here. {JK narrating] See, Grandpa can fix anything. You got to promise that you will set up and that you will clean up your mess. We promise. We promise. All right. Let's go. Thank you, Grandpa. I'll go make the calls. I'll go over to the school and put up some signs so the people will know. We want to thank you guys for coming out to introduce the newest members of the junior pep squad. {JK narrating] It was time for the dance performance and Alex and her squad were excited to perform. It's time to get down. Alex sure can move. All that practicing does pay off for her. {JK narrating] Alex and her squad were great, but now it's time to see who made the Junior Pep Squad. I can't believe I made the squad. Everyone was right. Hard work and courage does pay off. [man singing pop music] Did you girls have fun trying something new today? Yes, ma'am. Did you learn anything? Yes, ma'am. Like what? To keep trying and to never quit. Oh, I like that one. Keep trying and never quit. I'm going to remember that lesson. That one even works when you're an adult. Keep trying and never quit. I like that. {JK narrating] I'll never give up on anything. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
