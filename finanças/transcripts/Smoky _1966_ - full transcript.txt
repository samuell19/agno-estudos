[drumroll] [rousing orchestral fanfare playing] [fanfare ends] MAN [narrating]: One day in spring, way back in the late '30s, there was one particular member of a herd of ranch horses that figured it was just about time to cut out. Something important was going to take place in the near future, and it sure enough did. Oh, you could have told right away that he was pretty special. He wasn't an hour old before he found out how hard the ground was. But he was a stubborn one, and inside half an hour he was up to stay-- had to be if he wanted that first meal. At a time like that, who cares about visitors? Especially since he couldn't see maybe more than 2 feet in front of him anyhow. But a couple of weeks later, his coat turning deeper, he could see just fine and still get lost from his mammy. Sure, it was a frustrating experience, but it was as certain to happen to that colt as living or breathing or running. The reason for that was he was first class ranch blood, mostly mustang mixed with a strain of steeliness, and that meant that he had a world of independence built right into him. All the same, he was still a mite young for that kind of foolishness, and Mammy was a welcome sight. For her part, though, she had to put Junior in his place, so she just gave him the cold shoulder and went right on about her feeding. The trouble was, that only reminded Junior he was due for some feed, way overdue. And, like those things usually work out, he got his way... more or less. He had a mind of his own, and when he wasn't more than a month old, he decided it was high time to find out about mountain streams, an idea Mammy didn't exactly go along with. So there was nothing to do but fish him out and try to teach him a few more facts of life. The truth is... that mother of his taught him most everything she knew in those growing up days. And it was a mighty good thing that she did... because in his case, those days didn't last too long. That's how he found her one morning... so very still. He couldn't quite figure it out at first, but like the buzzard, there were others around who'd known all about it for some time. [snarling] He'd be on his own now for almost a year. That's how it was with him. A true loner, a wild mustang who'd learned to fend for himself, but who knew, even in his pride and his independence, that something was missing: his own kind. So that's when he joined up, became a part of the herd. The question that wasn't answered was how some day an animal like that would make out with a human? Or a human make out with him?

Hi, yourself. Ain't he something? That black one right there. I figured that was the one you meant. Yes, sir. Been keeping an eye on him off and on since he was a couple of weeks old. Well, I'd say that was about... four years ago. [men shouting] And Jeff still ain't caught him. Jeff, Mr. Nix, the one in front. He's the foreman of the Rocking R. Well... looks like's he's done it to you again, Huh, Jeff? We got other horses to worry about. And every year he'd say the same thing. Just wait till next roundup. Let's go. Well, I'd better be getting with the others. We're a little shorthanded these days. Yeah. Sure. See you again sometimes. Why, you slicker. [neighing] [neigh] That's it, boy. Right on down to the draw. Doing just fine, boy. Keep giving it all you got. I can run you out of tricks and out of wind. [kiss noise] Hyah. [men shouting] Miss Julie! Miss Julie! Yes, María? They're here. Be there in a moment. What did I tell you about going? They needed some help, Mom. The only one who needs your help around here is me. The fine father. You knew he was along. He was along? Never laid eyes on him till this second. Come on. Come on. [grumbling] Well, there they are. Jeff, they look good. A little more skittish than usual. They had an extra month of running wild. We'll simmer them down. Within our deadline, I hope. Haven't failed you yet, have I? What about the 4-year-old, the black? [man laughs] We'll get him next roundup, Miss Julie. I got more to do out there than just play around with one bronc. Of course you have, Jeff. -[neighing] -Oh, now what's coming here? It's him! It's him! [neighing] Who's that bringing him in? You got me. He's not one of our boys. I can believe that. Get out there and help him herd in that horse! Pepe, open the gate. I got it, Pa. [neighing] -Howdy. -Howdy. That's nice work. Hi again. Me and him met on the range. That was sure some trick, all right. Outsmarted him. Well, sure a nice spread. Got a feeling he belongs here. Well, no one belongs here until he's been broken. When a colt like him gets himself corralled, maybe that's what he's asking for. I hope he's worth all that. Him? There's a big difference, Mister, between a wild bronc and a good saddle horse. We only got so much time to spend on him. Well, I'd say that one would be worth all the time you could give him. [neighing] You could have all of mine. Thanks, but we're not taking on any extra hands. She's the owner. You be quiet. Now go to the storeroom and bring some potatoes to the kitchen. -Oh, Ma. -Come on. I know they're shorthanded. [neighing] Sure got eyes for that colt. You looking for work? No offense, Miss Julie, but we don't even know that he's a wrangler. After what you just saw? Jeff Nix, my foreman. I'm Julie Richards. I don't believe you mentioned your name. I'm Clint Barkley, ma'am. Nice to know you. Where you been working, Barkley? Just about all over. Where exactly? Texas, Arizona, Wyoming. No, I mean what ranch? Most all of them one time or another. I take it, then, you don't light in one spot for very long. It depends on the spot. This could be it. You have experience breaking in horses? Some. Well, there's 30 of those broncs that needs the rough edges taken off of them by the first of the month. Think you can handle half of them? Or all of them. You're that sure of yourself? Let's just say I know horses. What do you think, Jeff? Well, I guess with all that war ruckus going on in Europe, we could use an extra hand. You take care of your horse, and I'll give you your orders later. Thanks. You, too, Miss Richards. Oh, come on, Jeff. What's the matter? You act as if we didn't need an extra hand. I'm just not sure we need that one. I'd like to know something about the people we hire, that's all. Oh, you mean something other than his bringing in that stallion? Don't tell me that's it. You know exactly what I mean. When a man doesn't want to give reference, he usually has something to hide. Maybe I'm just not as trusting as you are. Mm, maybe you're just not as willing to gamble. We'll be seeing a lot more of you, young fella. [neighing] Did you get the job? Sure did. Shake. Well, see you later. Ride him! Yahoo! That's it! Ride him, Mr. Barkley! You got him! Yahoo! Yahoo! Hey, Pa, come on! Ride him! You got him quiet in a hurry, Mr. Barkley. Well, I don't figure they'll all be like that. Him especially. [neighing] Just for that, sonny, you're next. Are you going to do it? Are you really going to do it? We're just going to get acquainted. -Hey, Chuck. -Yo! Cut that black one out and send him in here. You practically got him. Hyah! Hyah! [neighing] Ho! Hah! Come here. [shouting] [neighing] Clint, you going to saddle him? No saddle this time. I don't want to rush this one. [neighing] Take it easy, sonny. Nobody's going to hurt you. [neighing] [neighing] You got him! You got him! That's it! Fight him, boy! Hey, which one are you for? Oh, Pa, there's never been a horse like that. Sure got your eye on me, haven't you? That's good... because the more you want, the more you're going to see, the quicker you'll learn. [neighing] Doesn't look like the start of a beautiful friendship, does it? Maybe it's bigger than that. Whoa, boy. He's just got a mind of his own. he's going to take plenty of time, all right. The question is, will he bring in that much better a price? You're not going to sell him with that bunch of crows, are you? Mr. Barkley, we are in the business of selling horses as well as cattle. That's just what I mean. This will be one you'll want to keep. He'll make one of the finest working cow ponies in the country, providing we break him right. Whoa. Whoa. Come on, Smoky. Don't make me a liar right in front of the boss. What did you call him, Smoky? Yeah. I figure where there's fire, there's smoke. Smoky. That's a swell name, Mr. Barkley. [Smoky neighing] Hey, Jeff, you missed his first workout. I thought we were supposed to be branding today. We are. The boys are getting along fine. That's right. We just got back from over there. Well, you can go right back again and stay there. He doesn't need the whole outfit to help him. Okay, Jeff. Hah. Ho. Ho. Hah. Manuel, there's some more of Miss Julie's packages in the truck. How would you like to carry them into the house for her? He's almost finished. It'll only be-- JULIE: Go on, Manuel. Be a good boy. Yes, ma'am. CLINT: Come on, boy. Jeff, I take it you got something on your mind. I have. Julie, as long as I worked for your father-- I think you know this-- he let me manage things pretty much the way I saw fit. And I don't, is that it? Yes and no. Yes and no. What I mean is him. Whoa. All right, boy. I'm going to leave you here a minute. You just remember... the better you treat this rope, the better it's going to treat you. You figure to keep him on after he finishes with those broncs? I don't know yet. Excuse me, folks. That's right, just leave it open. He's safe. I can't say he doesn't know his job. I'll go you one better. He's as likable a fella as I've ever met. But you're suspicious. I'm afraid it's a little more than that now. I thought his name rung a bell the first time I heard it. Then every time I tried to feel him out, he'd clam up. Well, from what a guy in town just told me, he had good reasons to. CLINT: Excuse me again, folks. Jeff, I'm not much for rumors, as you know. This rumor concerns a man named Clint Barkley. Same name, same size, same age. He got himself into a bad scrape down in Laredo, Texas, a little more than a year ago. What kind of scrape? Some money disappeared, quite a chunk of it. Well, Jeff, nothing you said so far amounts to anything but a rumor. Or a fact. -CLINT: Whoa. Whoa. -[Smoky neighs] Better give me a little room, Jeff. I got a young student here doesn't care much for school. Hah. Hah. I felt it was my job to tell you all this. I know what ought to be done. I know what I'd do, and right away. But it's up to you. I feel that's the way you want it. I'll let you know, Jeff. I'll carry these in for you. I can manage, thank you. All right. Whoa. I caught him looking at me just then, Mr. Barkley. He likes me. I can tell. Right now I wouldn't give you a plug nickel for what he thinks of any of us. But he'll get over that. Miss Richards. Here, let me help you with that. Thanks. I wanted to talk to you anyway. About selling Smoky? I wasn't really trying to make up your mind for you. I'll let him do that. Well, it wasn't about that, Mr. Barkley. Come, boy. Come, Smoky. [neighing] Aw, that's no way to act. I'm your friend. I wouldn't be as rough with you as Mr. Barkley. I'll take these in to María. I'll take them. I'll wait for you there. Mm, something sure smells good. Chocolate cupcakes. Yes. Manuel's favorite? No. Miss Julie's. Ah. Mine, too. María, you're sure a fine cook. Thank you, Mr. Clint. Howdy. Sit down, please, Mr. Barkley. Serious as all that? You could make it a lot less so, if you would. You name it, Miss Richards. Jeff told me something today. I want you to know he was only looking out after my interests. It was nothing personal. He's a first class foreman. He heard a story today having to do with Laredo, Texas. Does that mean I'm through? All it means, all it calls for, is a simple explanation from you. I wish it were that easy. There are some things you can't explain to some people. And the few you can explain to you don't need to. Or don't you believe that? Look, whether I believe it or not, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Barkley, is that I owe a responsibility to the people who work here. Then I guess that's it. You've got $140 coming. [Smoky neighing] Manuel! [neigh] Come on, Smoky, I'm going to get you. Watch it now. Watch it. Mami! Manuel! Miss Julie! Mr. Clint! Manuel! [shouting in Spanish] Get him over the fence. Smoky! Hah! Hyah! Hyah! Smoky. One more chore I'd like to do, Miss Richards-- try and get him back, if you don't mind. Of course not. [neighing] [Smoky neighing] Smoky. Get back. Back, back. Back. Back. [neigh] Back. Back. Whoa. Sorry to be so rough, young feller, but you're safe. What do you say we go home? [neighing] Well, you're home now, boy. He had a little trouble with some quicksand. Maybe he's more trouble than he's worth. One thing, he finally learned how to leap. then perhaps the rest of his training won't take so much of your time. You trying to tell me something, ma'am? Maybe you're right about Smoky. Are you asking me to stay on? I suppose I am. Kind of counted on that. So sure of yourself? No. I just figured you for one of those kind of people who don't need an explanation, any kind.

Well, Clint, this is Fred Denton. He'll be working with us now. This is Clint Barkley. Glad to know you. This is a nice spread you got here. Clean bunkhouse and a captive audience. How are you going to beat that? By the way, Clint, how'd you make out with that horse? He's outside. I'd better be at it. You mind if he gives me a hand? No. Go ahead, uh, Denton. I kind of got a feeling there he thought he knew you from someplace. Oh. That's one of my problems. I-- I got that kind of face, you know? Happens all the time. Hi, Clinter. What are you doing here? What are you after? You sound like you don't want me around. How could you guess? Not that I blame you, Clinter, after the way I let you down. Something just made me keep looking for you. You could have tried looking in the Laredo jail. I was in it most of last year. Maybe you won't believe this, but I only got word on that last week. If I'd have known, Clint, I'd have gone back and told them what really happened. Yeah. Sure you would. You're right. Maybe I wouldn't have had the guts. That's the kind of crumb I am. Now, look, Denton, or whatever it is you call yourself now, I want you to get a good night's sleep because I want you out of here by morning. I like this place, and I don't want you spoiling it. Sure, Clint. I'll push on. It's a nice ranch. It's peaceful. Not too big. If I can ever learn to stay in one place, maybe I can get to be a part of it. Yeah. I guess Jeff will want to know why I'm pulling out after sandbagging him into putting me on. You can think of something. I was hoping for a chance to work alongside you. Maybe you could help me keep in line. I never hit bottom before, or grew up. Like you said... I got to face it. If you won't help me, who will? Now you listen, Fred. If you pull just one stunt, just one-- And get us both pitched out of here when this is what I've been hoping for? All right. Let's go to work. Get that saddle. Clean off that horse and rub him down. Sure, Clint, sure. There, you see? It's just a blanket. Nothing scary about that. [neighing] Easy. Easy. Easy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. -Whoa. -[neigh] Whoa. Whoa. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Atta boy, Smoky. Atta boy. Whoa. Whoa. Easy there. Easy. Whoa, boy. Easy. Whoa. Easy, boy. Easy, Smoky. Whoa. Easy, boy. You want me to ear him down while you saddle him? There's no need for that. I don't think he's going to be too much trouble. How about when you get on him? That could be something else again. He's all yours. -[neigh] -Whoa. Easy. Easy. Easy. "Easy, easy," he says. You'd think he was bouncing a baby instead of busting a bronc. I say he's doing it just right-- one step at a time. You know, that's the difference between us, Pepe. You don't believe in shortcuts, and I do. Easy, Smoky. This isn't going to hurt a bit, either. -Whoa. -[neigh] Atta boy. We'll just tighten up this cinch a bit. Whoa, boy. [neigh] We'll get all the rest of it on. Sorry, Smoke, but there's got to be a first time for everything. Whoa, boy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I bet 2 bucks he stays with him all the way. How about it? My friend and I don't go for sucker bets. -Right, Manuel? -Right. Yeah. [neighing] [cheering] -Ride him, Mr. Barkley! -Ride him! Stay with him! That a way! Get on him! Come on! What a horse. What a man. María, be your age. I wish I was yours. FRED: Ride him, cowboy! Yeah! [cheering] Ride him, cowboy! Whoa. Whoa, boy. Come on, Smoky. Now, there's another thing you got to learn, Smoke, and that's neck reining so you'll turn at the slightest pressure. [barking] [neighing] Whoa! Whoa. Now, Smoky, you're not going to let a little old coyote frighten you, are you? That's one of the things you got to learn to expect: a lot of surprises. [neighing] Now, Smoky, get used to a swinging rope. Just want to show it to you. Whoa. So you know that, whatever's on the end of a rope, it's not going to hurt you. Atta boy. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Now, tomorrow, we'll try something a little bit heavier. Ahh. That's a good boy, Smoky. Feel the slack. How did he do today, Mr. Barkley? Well, today he got his diploma, that's how he did. Say, now that's fine. Give him something to take back to the hills with him the first chance he gets. Well, I wouldn't bet on that, Pepe. Anyway, he's not going to get the chance. Is he, Manuel? No, sir, not from me he ain't. [Pepe laughs] JEFF: Oh, Clint. How about those broncs, Clint? You, uh, turn out the good ones? Yeah. The ones you're selling are in the other corral. I told you they'd be ready, Mr. Abbott. What about this horse? He for sale? Smoky? No, he's not included. Why not? Well, because, uh... well, I mean, Miss Richards, this horse-- keeping him here, he'll be worth at least twice what you'd get in a sale. At least that. If he's all that good, Mister, he may bring more than you think. The fact is, he's not ready yet. What do you mean he's not ready, Clint? You've been riding him. I didn't know you had a partner. She hasn't. Denton, climb aboard that black and show Mr. Abbott what he can do. Yes, sir. I tell you, Jeff, he's not ready yet. Oh, come on, Clint. We're big boys now. A horse is a horse. [neigh] Hold on, you lop-eared thing. Stop it. Whoa, Smoky. Stop it. Whoa. I told you he's not ready. Yeah, I'll ready him. I'll throw him on his back. What's the matter with you? That's no way to treat a horse. Any horse. Whoa, Smoky. -Yeah? -It's all right, boy. All your mollycoddling. I never saw a horse yet I couldn't break in half the time it takes you. Besides this one, you mean. It doesn't look like you're making out too good with him. Whoa, boy. You just give me a chance to get in the saddle, that's all. I think I can fix that. Sorry about this, boy. Okay, Fred, you're on. [Pepe laughs] That knot-head's a killer! [laughter] What kind of an animal is that? Whoa, boy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, boy. Anyway, Jeff, if this is the kind of saddle horse Mr. Abbott's interested in, here he is. Well, saddle horses is just one of my interests. I just don't buy for ranches. I represent rodeos, too. A wild saddle bronc like him, a good box office attraction. I haven't seen anything like him in 20 years. Miss Richards, an animal like that, I'd pay as high as $1,250. That's an offer. That's a firm offer. JULIE: It's a pretty good one. What do you say, Miss Richards? I don't think so. What else is he going to be good for? You saw what happened. You were going to sell him anyway. I changed my mind, Jeff. All right. 1,500. And you can't beat that price in any market. $1,500 is a lot of money. No, thanks, Mr. Abbott. I think I'll hold onto him for a while. If you change your mind, you've always got a deal. Come on, Mr. Abbott. I'll show you the rest of the stock. Pepe, Denton, the rest of you boys, get your saddles. Are you coming? I'll be along shortly. I want to thank you. For what, making a good business decision? Well, the trouble is I can't swear he's going to be the horse I said he'd be, not after all of that. The kind of treatment he just got, that could tear down everything I've tried to build up. Well, with the character you've given him, he could run for sheriff. And get elected. How you doing, Smoke? His first roundup, and I ain't so sure he likes it. And how did you like your first day in school? I stayed home. Ha ha ha ha! That's what he should have done. He'll be about as much use around here as a jackrabbit. You just wait till you see him in action, buddy boy. Yeah, I probably will, high tailing straight for the tall timber. Ha ha. Come on. Hyah.

And it was some song you picked last night. That Laredo business. I just thought I'd throw a nice square one at them for a change. It's a good thing Jeff didn't let you do that encore. You could have followed that with something like "Jailhouse Blues." Oh, for-- What's the matter with you, Clint? Look, all that's in the past. It's just in your mind anyway. You're part of this outfit now. We both are. You're in solid. We can stay here as long as we want. I reckon the war could change that a little. If we get in it. Looks like we're bound to. I'm talking about us, Clinter, you and me. And I don't feel mean enough to shoot nobody. Have you, uh, registered with that draft board yet? A gentle troubadour like me? Whoo. I'm a conscientious musician. I don't like the war tunes. There's nothing to them. Why, if I ever got these fingers shot off, I'd lose half my personality. And besides, who are we fighting anyway? Just people. I'm going to slay them with my guitar. ♪ Smile as you go by, buddy ♪ [imitating machine gun] Anyway, I think I'm gonna get about as lucky as you are. Or as smart. What do you mean by that? Come on, Clinter. We're cowpokes, ain't we? We're feeding the country. That can make us draft-exempt if we can con the local draft board. Besides, you heard any married guys they're drafting lately? Who's married? Well, the way you've got your hooks out, I'd say you were planning on-- You son of a gun. Unless somebody else beat you to it. There go some bunch quitters. -We better get them. -Right. -Hah. -Hyah. That's only your second plateful, Pepe. What's happened to your appetite? [muffled] Must be somewhere around here. Just give me time. Clint. I want you to go over to Box Canyon and look for strays. Pepe, you do the same in Rock Ridge. Denton, here, will help you. [muffled] You mean now? Now before you bust. Hiya, Smoke. You old faker. Ha ha. This? Ah, you want to go along, do you? Huh? All right, Mister. We'll see if you are just as good as you think you are. Well, this is where I leave you guys. We'll meet back here with any strays we find and run them in together. It's okay with me, just so we get back to the camp in time for supper. [chuckling] [kiss noise] [neigh] [neighing] [cough] [cough] Ohh... Well, Smoke, I got busted up a little. It's not your fault. Oh, boy. Got to get back to the ranch. Move up a little, Smoke. All right, Smoke. It's up to you, boy. Hold it. You see if you can hold his eye while I sneak around and get a rope on him. Hey, wait. He won't let you get near him. Do you notice what stirrup he's hanging onto? Yeah. The right one. Any other horse would have kicked his brains out. [kiss noise] Looks like he might be headed for the ranch. Yeah, well, we better keep our distance, or he's liable to drag Clint to pieces. María. Come. [neighing] PEPE: Miss Julie. Wait! Stay back. Don't come any closer. Mr. Clint! You, too. Hold it right there, both of you. See if you can open the corral gate without scaring him. How are we going to get him out of there? [neigh] Let me try, Miss Julie. Pepe, be careful. Easy, boy. Easy. We're not going to hurt you. We're not going to hurt Clint, either. [neighing] Easy, boy. It's all right, Smoky. It's all right. [neighing] Pepe, he'll trample him. I'll get him away. He won't fight this. Wait. Clint? Clint? Clint, take your arm out of the stirrup. Take your arm out of the stirrup, Clint. Take it out. Pepe, get a rope. [neigh] Okay, Clint. Grab hold of that. I'll draw him off over here. [neighing] Smoky, hyah. [neigh] Hyah! Let's get him to the house. I will call the doctor, Miss Julie. Well, aren't we chipper this morning. [wolf whistle] What's the matter? You look kind of nice. You mean I don't look like a ranch boss? I didn't say that. But you were thinking that. I'm going to prove to you how female I am by nursing you back to health. How's Smoky? Look, I know the two of you are inseparable, but this is a one-horse ward. You mind undoing your pajama coat? What for? Well, Dr. Jameson can't make it this weekend, so I'm going to have to re-tape you. Maybe we better wait. No, I think we're going to do it right now. You know... your hair is the color of... uh...uh-- Corn silk? Wouldn't a wrangler be lost without that one? So I'm not so good with the words. Well, you're not particularly tongue-tied when it comes to Smoky. You've got to admit he's kind of special. One day we'll name a park after him. Sound jealous? Julia Richards, girl rancher? I'll tell you something. He is just a horse. And I'm going to match him mane for mane. Ohh! Whoo. What's that? Some ether. Refreshen your skin. Is there any left? That better? Ohh. Now, take a deep breath. Deep breath. I guess you know I'm grateful. Hold it. You know, I've been thinking. Maybe you'd help me celebrate. Celebrate? Uh, you and some of the boys. Some of the boys? Well, you know, nothing wild. We could just go into town and hit a few places. And how are the ribs? Did Miss Julie do a good job? Perfect. Perfect? Shame on you, Miss Julie. I have to do it all over again. Ow! No! ♪ How about another round here? None for me. I'm fine. I'll take another one, please. Me, too. I'll have another. Three. It was nice seeing you. Oh, thank you very much. Hello, baby. Listen, I thought you might like to join me for a drink. I'd like to do that, but I'm with that party over there. So all you got to do is tell them you stopped to talk to a long-lost cousin. You think they'd believe anything like that? Hey, look, you just put it down right there and let me worry about them, okay? Well, just for a second. Bartender? May I check your hat, sir? Thank you. Say, look, baby, maybe you're right. You waltz on back to your table, okay? What's going on here? Look, I'll explain it to you later. Hmm. Mm-hmm. [song ends, applause] Hey, well, well. Hey, look who's here. Come on over and join the party. Right over here, half the whole outfit. Even Pepe managed to get away from María. Jeff, Scubby, Pepe. -Howdy, Miss Julie. -Hi, Miss Julie. Clint, how are you? Now, ain't that nice, boys? The two of them out making the rounds together. Well, we weren't exactly making the rounds. Miss Richards drove me in for the last session with the doc, and we just decided to stay around for a while. Mm-hmm. You know what I'm going to do right now, Miss Richards? I'm going to give a concert in honor of old Clinter's recovery. Well, now, come on, Fred, don't bother. Now wait. What I forgot to add was that it's even more in honor of our boss lady. So you got nothing to say about it. Well, maybe she's got something to say. Yeah, she'll probably have plenty, but, as the man said, that's a chance I got to take. I'll see you when I get back. Okay if I borrow this thing for a minute? Go ahead.

It's a funny thing, but you made such a slam-bang hit with Miss Julie that she just plumb fainted away. And Clint had to take her back to the ranch. At least I think that's where he took her. Hmm. Yeah. Good boy, Smoke. We showed them, didn't we? Hey, what's been keeping you two? you know what day this is? Yeah, it's Saturday. We're all supposed to be over at the Double-O Ranch, in case it slipped your mind. It never slipped mine. He just seems to think fence mending's more fun than barbecues. Well, everybody's took off already, and I'm on my way, too. Hey, Clint, there's a fellow waiting to see you. Yeah? Who is it? Well, you've got me. He just said he wanted to talk to Clint Barkley. He's over in the bunkhouse. Okay. You know something, Pepe? He's getting better every week. You should have seen him today. All right, now we got a hoedown to get to. I'll take care of him for you. [Smoky neighing] -You knot-head. -Let him loose! Let him go! Someday somebody's going to teach you some manners. It might even be me. [neigh] All right. Whoa. Whoa. It's all right. I got you. I'll just put him in this corral for the evening. I understand you want to see me. No, not you. I'm looking for a Clint Barkley. Well, you're looking at him, Mister. My name's Gordon. I run a little gambling house in town. A guy gave me this about a month ago, and I haven't seen him since. Came out to collect it. Well, not from me you aren't. Well, I don't care who I get it from, just as long as I get it. You any idea who that is? I can't be sure. He plays a guitar, and, uh, he bets like he thinks he knows what he's doing. Does that help you any? Listen, if that guy's connected with this outfit and you're covering for him, there's going to be a lot of noise around here. Now you listen. I don't like this any more than you do, somebody forging my name. Suppose I borrow this a while. Oh, no, you don't. That's the only one I got. You bet it is. An IOU with the wrong name on it. Now suppose you get in your car and go back to your parlor and I'll see if I can get your money for you. Okay. Oh, uh, you don't even know where I'm located. The guy who wrote this does, doesn't he? Yeah. [car engine starts] Hey, Clint. If you're ready, I am. Let's go. You're the one that wanted another chance. What's the matter with you? Don't hand me that, Fred. I know your signature when I see it. And Gordon knows what a guitar looks like. Come on, Clinter. Where's your sense of humor? He can't nail you for that. It ain't your signature. That's right. But it's your debt. You still don't get it, do you? It ain't your signature, and it ain't mine. He's got nothing on either one of us. Fred, you're no good, and you never will be. Now you're clearing out of here. You've caused me all the trouble you're going to. Now quit worrying, will you? If that's how you feel, I'll pay the man. You bet you will because I'm going to drive you to town to see that you do. Now go pack your things. Just a minute. Maybe I'm not ready to quit this job. And besides, you can't fire me. You're not the foreman. I said go pack your things. Not that you couldn't be foreman, I guess. Or even part owner. That's why I'd hate to see anything louse you up. Like what, Fred? Well, look. Now, we both know what happened down there in Laredo. But you're the one that served time. I just wonder what the boss lady would think if she knew that her boyfriend was nothing but a jailbird. That was your second mistake. I'm going to give you a break, Fred. I'm going to help you pack. ABBOTT: A horse? From the Rockin' R? You bet I remember him. Wild as a cougar. Well, how'd you like to have him, Mr. Abbott? That's right. Yeah, Miss Richards changed her mind. But it's got to be a pretty fast deal, or she's liable to change it back again. [continues] $1,750? For a rodeo horse? You must be crazy. Look, we could get 2 grand for him if we really shopped around, and you know it. You got a deal. Okay. You'll have him later tonight. Cash on delivery. Right. [neighing] We're going to take a little trip, Smoky. [neigh] But first I think we're going to have to tame you down a little. If you're ready, I am. I don't know how much you're going to like this, buster, but I'm going to like it fine. [neigh] It's too bad old Clinter isn't here to see how it's done. [neighing] Clint, I've always felt there was some special connection between you and Fred Denton. What was it? I knew he was no good. I knew he shouldn't have been here in the first place. If you knew that, why didn't you say something? I kept... hoping he'd change. He was my brother. Clint. You've nothing to blame yourself for, nothing at all. Maybe. About all I'm sure of right now is, after I get back from town, I want to go after Smoky. He's probably halfway across country by now. That is, if he can still run. What do you mean? There are a lot of people around here who would consider a killer horse like that fair game to shoot on site. That's why I want to reach him before they do. They'd never believe he had every reason in the world for doing what he did. Except that I wasn't here to see what happened. I don't think anybody else was. You see the blood on the cinch ring, can't you? Clint, you take all the time you need. I wish you luck. Thank you. You bet I seen him. But I ain't the only one. There was a whole bunch of guys after him. Looked like a regular posse. Where was this and how long ago? Oh, it was a couple of weeks ago, over by Shamrock Basin. Shamrock Basin. But you might as well head right on to Arizona the way that horse was traveling. Brother, he was wild. Well, thanks for the coffee. Don't mention it. Nope. Ain't seen nothing of a horse like that. Or men, either. Well, that's his trail, just the same. Reckon I might as well stay on it. Say, uh, you wouldn't be interested in a job, would you? What I'm doing right now is my job. You'll get a lot of offers along the line. All the fellas around here have been pulling out. Why is that? What do you mean, why is that? The war. The war? Where you been, Mister? We've been at war since Monday morning. Here, let me take that. Thanks, Jeff. We'll keep looking for him, let you know. He'll come back by himself. I'll bet he will. Good luck, Clint. [speaking Spanish] [car engine starts] You'll write us? And hurry back? I will, Julie. Gonna run that horse to death. Won't be good for any rodeo then. Ah, he's headed right where we want him. He's gonna have some company waiting on him. [neighing] [gasping] Hey, Pete, we've got to do something about this horse. He's plumb wore out. He just can't carry anyone on his back anymore. Well, I got what I paid for. And he didn't cost a cent. You got him free? Them rodeo people said he made so much money for them, they didn't want to shoot him. So they just give him to me. I ain't so generous. A junkman offered me 30 bucks for him. And I just might take it. Well, you better hurry before he changes his mind. Whoa. ♪ [marching band] Jeff. Clint, how are you? Boy, the Marine Corps did all right by you. Out of the service just in time for the big rodeo. Well, once a cowpoke, always a cowpoke. Clint. Ohh. It's so good to have you home. In case either of you are interested, uh, there's a parade coming this way. What parade? Come on. Whoa. ♪ [laughter] I'll learn you a lesson, running off like that. Now take it easy, Mister. You don't want to treat your horse this way. All he wanted to do was get in the parade. Why don't you mind your own business? It's all right, boy. I'll learn you a lesson. I wouldn't do that, either, if I were you. Wouldn't hurt you to feed him something. It's all right, boy. It's all right. [neighing] Whoa! Come back here. Come on, old fella. It's not as bad as all that. Looks like you made yourself a friend, Clint. I guess he needed one. I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get a cup of coffee before the rodeo starts. -Good idea? -Yeah. Excuse us, please. You're going to see the greatest show you ever saw in your life. What will you have, folks? Just coffee for me, please. Make that two. Uh, put a hamburger with it. Plain? Yeah. A little lettuce and tomato, mayonnaise, relish, and onion. Say, did you notice he had a star? What? That junkman's horse. He had a star on his forehead. So he had a star. So what will you have? Oh, I-- I'll have the same. Without the onions. You know, there's something about that horse. Do you mind if I use your car? But what about the rodeo? Never mind, Jeff. Give him the keys. I'll try not to be too long. I'll meet you at the rodeo. I'll hurry. Now what was that all about? Just something he'll have to find out for himself. Where'd he go? He went to see a man about a horse. A truck is what I use. So I'm sure I ain't got a horse like that or any other kind. And I can't say I know who has. Well, somebody has. I saw him today. He got into the parade. Hmm. Let me see. You were over at Schultz' and Brown's, and they didn't have him. And Old Lady Johnson, she's got a truck, too. And, as I said, I ain't got him. So that just about does it. Much obliged. Hey. Wait a minute. Come to think of it, I did hear of a man moving in on the other side of Cross Creek with the name of Gonzales or Martinez-- something like that. Thanks. Well, hope you find him. [thunder rumbles] Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. You're the one, all right. I had a hard time finding you. What do you want? I want to look at your horse. Yeah? What for? Well, I might want to buy him from you. Buy him? Well, it all depends. Where is he? He's out back. Mind if I take a look at him? No, I guess not. I'll turn on the light. Smoky? Smoky. It's been a long time, hasn't it, boy? A long time. A long time. Whoa. Ah. Thanks, Pepe. When that horse first came back here, I figured we'd have to shoot him. I thought we'd have to shoot Mr. Clint.
