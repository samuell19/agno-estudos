We are talking about a case... That has truly shaken up the conscience of the country... It's only been 2 days old but public outrage has spread like wildfire across the country. As we speak, we are here outside the victim's home. We have not been permitted to enter. The nation has so many questions regarding this case... Why do the accused find protection from politicians? Why do such crimes take place with such regularity? Year after year, why is there no improvement in safety? The entire nation is right now— Turn off the TV. Switch it off. (Bell) Oh God! This is all we need! Maushi please... Don't ruin everyone's mood... Look at where we are, it's already ruined! What do you gain by saying such stupid things, Maushi? Maushi's right... It's getting way too hot for me here... Hot? With those thighs showing? It's so hot under my burkha, I could cook kebabs! What? Jhaang what? Thighs... Jyoti di, please go and see. They will keep going on and on... On and on? How long will this go on? We've got only one decent room. How many more people are they going to stuff? I told you'll before... Please don't bicker after prayers... But who tells you to light the incense? Listen girl... There is no god here! Must have gone to check the cable... All I want is peace for everyone... You want peace, right? Then don't let that girl come in! We will all have peace! Where will she live? On our heads? [Signs] So where will she go? So where will she go? We need a system... Everyone can't stay here... Someone will eventually have to leave, right? Ha! It's the first time she's said something sensible! Let whoever came last stay outside. Why should we leave? Yes! The count here is increasing, Arzu ji. Looking at the news it seems, a new person will come everyday. How many will we send away? All of them... Who are they to us? Who are we to each other? We are still here together, right? Yes... But as if anyone asked us! We were just stuffed here like sardines in a can! (Bell) So many girls... How will we accommodate all? Di, you haven't opened a public shelter. Please don't make this your problem... They will manage on their own... Exactly Jyoti... You're also a victim. Here they go again... In English! I only know English. If you people are Marathi-medium educated, it's not my problem. Madam, we didn't even go to school! We were married off at 12. I guess that's why we're sitting here on the floor and you're up there rocking on your throne! So come sit! Sit here! When have I ever stopped you? Stop it, that's enough! You too.. There's someone outside waiting for an answer... How do we decide who stays and who leaves? (Bell) What if the person who did it was a father, brother or husband— Then they can stay here? We're safe then! Not me. Mine were roadside hooligans. So then let's decide by their age. Whoever's was less than 25, stays, or else leave. You knew my husband was 50, didn't you? Rotten scoundrel! He was 42... 55. And there were 2 of them. So totally 110. Should I go home then? Di... (Bell) Or else, the way we were... Hey! That's cheating! You were burnt alive! Maushi! Yes... I was burnt. How about the rest of you? Strangled. With a beer bottle. Then thrown on the highway. [Signs] With a rock. With a knife. Mine wasn't the incident, It was the trauma.... So you leave then! Excuse me? Madam! No one here even had the time to cry... Yours was the easiest! It's so evident! Get out! What the **** Mausi? Just because I did not bleed, or was stabbed does not mean my pain was any less than yours! You're so... you're so mean! See, you made her cry! Maushi, you're such a bitch sometimes. She also speaks in English, but says what she means to the face! Just shut up Unlike you! Just shut up! Maushi, what's wrong with you? You're the eldest here... You should be understanding... Hey! And what exam are you studying for? The one you're never going to give? Focus on real issues now! I'd rather study these corpses than look at your face all day! Baby! Laxmi! Get up! Come, we will go! Yes leave! Leave right away! We'll leave right away! Take them along with you! Enough! That's it! No one is going anywhere. And whoever is at the door won't be sent away either... We'll adjust with the space we have Weren't we adjusting there as well? Yes... It'll be a bit crowded here, but it's better than living with those demons! Fine. But I won't share my mattress with anyone. Jyoti please go get her... If anyone misbehaves, Behri, deaf-mute, will hide the TV remote for a week. Remember when we came here... How frightened we all were... Say Namaste to everyone? [Signs] You are safe here. In India, every 22 minutes a woman is raped. The 2018 study by Thomson Reuters found... On the issue of women's safety, India is one of the worst. INDIAN COURTS HAVE A BACKLOG OF MORE THAN 100,000 PENDING RAPE CASES. EACH DAY CLOSE TO 90 RAPES ARE REPORTED IN INDIA. THE CONVICTION RATE IN RAPE CASES IS JUST 32% IT IS IRONIC THAT CRIME RATES AGAINST WOMEN ARE HIGHER IN A NATION WHERE NEARLY 80% OF THE POPULATION WORSHIPS GODDESSES. Devi Goddess
