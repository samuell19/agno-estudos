(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) ERIC LeMARQUE: I was a good kid. A strong kid. I always had a deep desire to win. Everything for me was competition. Hockey was my sport. And that sport became my drug. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I got hit a lot in hockey. I got hit hard. I got driven into the boards. I dislocated a shoulder. I tore up a knee. I couldn't walk for a summer. I fell on my face. I ate through a straw. I got hit, I fell, I got back up. That's how I won. Until I got hit by something... I couldn't beat. I became addicted to another drug. It created a false sense of victory. I was in darkness. I lost my way. - (ALARM BEEPING) - DJ: ...24 hours a day. I bet the only thing cranked up in your house... ERIC: Maybe the only way to stop was to die. DJ: We're gonna give you some more of that coming up. Let me give you guys the weather today on this... can we call it lovely February 6, 2004? Looks like a big storm coming in later this afternoon. This is the craziest winter I've seen in years. Seriously... ERIC: Romans 7 says, "For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out, for I do not do the good I want to do but the evil I don't want to do. - This I keep on doing." - (DJ CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND) (HEARTBEAT) (ENGINE REVVING) (INHALES) (TIRES SQUEAL) (CRASH, SIREN WAILS) WOMAN: Do you know how many millions of kids dream of being a pro athlete, of having that chance? And... and you're throwing it away by snorting meth? Eric! I'm done. I'm not going to help you anymore until you want to help yourself. Well, I hired you a lawyer. He said you absolutely have to show up in court in seven days... (ECHOING) And you're going to have to commit to a 12-step recovery program. (WATER RUNNING) - (WATCH BEEPS) - (PANTING) Oh, my God. (SNIFFS) Oh, my God. - (BANGS WALL) - Idiot. Come on. Oh, God. - (STEEL RATTLES) - That's your equity, idiot. (GROANS) - (BUS ENGINE REVVING) - Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! God! - (DOG BARKS) - Hey. - Hey. - Ooh. But... seriously, there's four reasons why you should not be eating that, the first one being that's where Jackson pees. (DOG WHIMPERS) Yeah. It also lowers your body temperature and makes you prone to hypothermia. But the thing that most people don't know is it actually dehydrates you. So, all in all, not a good idea. - Good to know. - Um, I'm Sarah, by the way. - Eric. - Headed up the mountain? - Yeah. - Hop in, I'll give you a ride. (ENGINE STARTS) (DOG BARKS) (DOG WHIMPERING) - This close enough for you? - (DOG BARKS) Whoa! Jackson, leave him alone. We gotta go. Be safe out there, okay? - Thanks. Don't tell your beautiful mother our secret, okay, buddy? (DOG BARKS) Enjoy the mountain air. Always do.

It's a large impact zone, definitely worse than we thought. - It's predicting two or three feet tonight. - (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Patrol 2, this is RM. What's your location? Over. MAN: This is Patrol 2. I'm at the top of the trail. How's your visibility up there? Well, the vis is really bad. When you get off the top, there are pockets below of total whiteout. We might wanna consider shutting down the mountain early. (GROANS) (WIND HOWLING) Argh! Idiot! (BEEPING) (SIGHING) Seriously? God! Okay, baby. It's you and me. Oh!

You know, maybe our son would be so much happier if he had the time to play and see friends and watch a little TV, God forbid, instead of worrying about pro hockey and the draft, whatever new skill you've tasked him with that he'll never be perfect enough for you.

It's gotta be really hard for you to come and see me and see my awesome life with this great house and this amazing view, but the only reason why I'm here is because you decided not to be. I'm sorry, dude. I... I get it, man. I'm right there alongside you, man. I get it, I miss it too. All the guys that ever played miss it. That's... that's why I do this stuff.

Eric? - (DOG BARKING) What's happening down here? Are you all right? - Fine, Mom. - What's going on? Come on, Eric. You're living down here for six months... no job, no money, no nothing... and this is what you're doing, destroying everything? You think I wanna be here, living like this? You think I wanna be reminded of this shit every day? No, I don't! No! And I wanna help you! I'm your mother! I wanna help you, but you have to let me in! (WIND HOWLING) A signal. Maybe if I can get a signal... - (STATIC) - ...they can track me. Find me. (PHONE DIALLING) Come on. Come on. - Oh, crap. - MAN: Yeah, hello? - Oh, hello. - Hello? Hi, Tony. This is Susan LeMarque. I-I'm Eric's mother. - Oh, hey. Yes, hi. I know that we haven't spoken much, because, uh, well, anyway, I know he's talked about you, about snowboarding. And, uh... he's up in Winterhaven, or he was the last time I spoke to him, but he's missed a very important court date. And I'm very worried about him, and I haven't spoken to him in six days. - What's this have to do with me? - I was wondering if he'd reached out to you. - Yeah, I called him up there. - You did? Oh, when was that? It was, uh, Thursday. I see. Do you have an address for him? - Yeah, let me look. - Oh, fantastic. - He's at the Winterhaven cabin. - Great. - Very easy to find. - Oh, this is wonderful, Tony. More than you can know. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah. (GROANS) Ah! (GROANING) (RADIO STATIC) (GROANING) (STATIC) (GRUNTING) (WIND HOWLING) Oh, please, please, don't let me find him lying on the floor. Please. Eric? Eric? What? Eric! Oh... his clothes are still here. Dammit. Eric? (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) - Sarah, Risk Management. - Susan. Nice to meet you. So exactly how long has it been since you last saw your son? Seven days. I went to the cabin and there was no phone, wallet or keys, but everything else was there. And when you last heard from him, you're sure he was here? Oh, yes, he left me a message. I just... I didn't hear my phone. Okay, the first thing we do in this situation is file a missing-persons report with the sheriff's office. If they don't have any leads, I'll call Search and Rescue. The process will probably take a day or two. A...? No, no, Sarah, you don't understand. My son had a court date yesterday that he missed. Okay? And that message he left me, that was not normal, him telling me where he was and what he was doing. He never does that, never. You wanna know why he did it? Because he was letting me know he was gonna make it to the court date, he was getting it together. So when I walk into that courtroom and he is not there, and then I walk into that cabin and see his clothes and old congealed food sitting there and no him? I can't wait a day or two, and if he is out there in that snow, on that mountain, neither can he! - Okay. You have a photo? - Yes, yes, I do. - WOMAN: Search and Rescue. - Search and Rescue? RM down at Winterhaven. I need to report a missing person. What's the name? - Full name? - Eric LeMarque. - Eric... Eric LeMarque. - How long has he been missing? - Seven days ago. - You have a photo? Yeah, I'm getting the photo now. I'm gonna need Search and Rescue on the helipad in 15 minutes. - Fifteen, copy. - Thank you. - You know my son? - Walk with me. - You've met my son? - I've met your son. I gave him a ride up the mountain seven days ago but that's all I know. Right now I'm just trying to take precautions. Corey, get the team searching for anything with radio comms. I'm talking about cell phones, FM/AM radios, anything that's gonna receive a signal. - You got it. - Hopefully, he can get to the top. You think he's up there? I know he's up there. - Ready to go? - Yeah, let's go. (ENGINE STARTS) PILOT: Patrol 1, search and rescue in progress. White male, 6'3" tall. Curt, anything come up yet? FM, AM, cell. Nothing. T-cast is clear. (STATIC) We've got 15 minutes till we lose visibility. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Ah! Wait! Argh! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! - (RADIO STATIC) - (PANTING) Wait... Sarah, we have to call it. (HAUNTING MUSIC) SUSAN: I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. Mama loves you. With all her heart. No. I can't let her find me like this. Hey. Thought you might want these. It gets pretty cold up here. - That's very kind. - You must definitely want that back. Yes, definitely. Thank you. As soon as the sun comes up, we'll be back up there. What about tonight? What's Eric gonna do out there tonight? If I take my team out there tonight, this becomes a rescue mission for more than one person. I can't risk that. I'm sorry. Are you close with your mother, Sarah? Sometimes. I bet you call her, like, once... every other week or so, if that much. I can guarantee you that those seven minutes are the highlight of her month. Because then she gets to feel like she's a part of your life again. 'Cause she still remembers when you were little and she would hold you and sing you to sleep, and it was the happiest time of her life. I just want you to imagine, God forbid, something should happen to you in your line of work and you were no longer here. Your mother's life would essentially be over. Her heart would be an empty hole. I just need you to understand. You have to find my son. Please. You have to find him. (SNIFFLING) (STATIC) Gotta make it to the top. (BEEPING) Hey, this has been the coldest winter we've had in 10 years. Three, four days tops. That's the longest someone could survive out there in these conditions. I'll call the report in. Thanks. Comm Center from Life Flight. MAN: Go for Comm Center. You can cancel search and rescue. This is gonna be a body recovery. (RADIO STATIC) (GARBLED VOICES AND STATIC) Ah! Ah! (ROARING) Ah! (WIND HOWLING) About 12 more steps. Ah! - (GARBLED VOICE AND STATIC) - (TUNING RADIO) (GARBLED VOICES) (STATIC) (GARBLED VOICES) (HIGH-PITCHED WHINE) DJ: All right, results are in. Your kids made the snowmen you sent us to our radio station's website... SARAH: Hey, guys, can you excuse me for a minute? DJ: We have some late-breaking information. Turns out a face drawn on the windshield of a car does not count as a snowman. That is just a car... (RADIO STATIC) - (SIGHING) - DJ: ...not actually made out of snow. (STATIC) Help... Help. (INDISTINCT DJ CHATTER) (GROANING) (TURNS OFF RADIO) Oh, my... Are you kidding me, man? The organization dumped me! You don't gotta lie to me about it. I was at that practice when you walked away. You were the future of the franchise. You were twice as good as I ever was. Do you understand how frustrating that is? To watch somebody that has everything, everything, and then you just walk away! You quit! COACH: LeMarque! LeMarque! What the hell are you doing? It's not I, it's we! It's the crest on the front, not the name on the back! You're gonna have to figure that out! Now, today, get off my ice. Beat it! I've had enough of you. You're done for the day. Get off my ice. You're right. I am done. COACH: Don't even think about it. That's a one-way ticket, pal. (GROANING) - ERIC: Dad! - SUSAN: No, Eric. Don't go after him. - Dad! Dad! Dad! Where are you going? Dad? Dad! You can't go! You can't leave! Open the door right now! You can't go! - Come here, baby. Come on. - (CAR STARTS) Oh, I'm so sorry. - (TIRES SQUEAL) - Where are you going? - You can't leave your own son, you coward! - No! Oh, no! Eric, don't! Don't! What are you doing? Wait! Don't do it! (THUNDER) Dad! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) This isn't my fault! They took my skates! Stop pointing this at everybody else. Because you do that in life, it is gonna hurt a whole lot worse than this, do you understand me? Do you understand me? - Yes, sir. The whole world's wondering, LeMarque... Why'd ya quit? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) DJ: ...Spencer and his snowman is that huge! That is a lot of snow. Did anybody notice... (GROANS) Hi, Mom. It's me. I don't really know what it is I wanna say. But I don't think I have too much time, so... I just want you to know that I'm Okay with how this ends. And that I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. Turns out I'm a bit of a coward myself. It's funny. We only get to live life forward. But it never makes any sense until we're looking back. I need you to know that... we've cancelled the search and rescue. Why? We've now ruled this a body recovery. I love you, Mom. COREY: Hey, uh, Sarah, we just had a signal pop up. - (MONITOR BEEPING) - Wait, wait, hold on, hold on... A signal popped up and then it disappeared. - Where? - Mount Widow's Peak. But it wasn't one of ours. - You sure? - Yeah, positive. This is RM. We just picked up a signal on Mount Widow's Peak. PILOT: Coordinates are north 4-0-3-2-3-0.60, west 111-4-1-3.07. Hold on, Eric. Hey, got him! Up on that ridge, two o'clock. (SOFTLY) Please, let him be alive. Please, let him be alive. Please, let him be alive. PILOT: Search and Rescue to base. Two minutes out before landing. (HAUNTING MUSIC) You're gonna be okay, Eric. You're gonna be okay. Eric. You're alive! I love you, sweetheart. ERIC: Sometimes you get hit. You fall. You can't get back up. And you fall further. Before the mountain, I couldn't see how far I'd fallen. Maybe that's what I had to go through to finally live. Sometimes a part of yourself has to die, maybe even the part you love most, before you can realize what makes you whole, and clearly see that it's larger than us. If you're in the dark, get through it by seeing the invisible so that you can do the impossible. Be responsible and accountable for yourself. Just fail forward. It'll all make sense when you see the light at the break of dawn. I thank my mother for being there for me, I thank my wife for loving me, I thank my kids for inspiring me. And now, by the grace of God, I can thank you, hockey, and the mountain, for giving me my hope.
