[match striking] [flame crackling] [serene music] - [Narrator] In the far reaches of the North American continent is a hostile landscape of ice and snow. Living in these alpine regions, we find a species of human inhabitants as daring as they are bizarre. They cherish this world's simplicity. They find bliss in the casual glide and contentment in the wondrous places their magic sticks take them. Winter's snowy blanket has the power to transform an inanimate landscape into the mother of all amusement facilities. Where those who venture are limited only by what the body can handle, and their minds can imagine. This rare breed of creature seeks, the now. Amongst this species, are a mind blowing rookie, an old wise man, a veritable spinning top, and the human incarnation of like father, like son. - [Skier] Yoo! - [Narrator] Four strange men and a handful of their pack who all share a common impulse, to emerge from their summer hibernation and return to the mountains to bloody send 'er. ♪ Freedom [upbeat rock music] - Are you guys ready to send it? - [Skier] Let's go! ♪ Search through my heart in a sky full of eyes ♪ ♪ Leap in and dance with the blind ♪ ♪ Feels like my hands have been forced, tied, pried ♪ ♪ Can't go nowhere but behind ♪ Look at the streets ♪ People is losing their lives ♪ People is losing their mind ♪ Go cop a gun ♪ Cop a plea ♪ Cop a room at the nine ♪ Look up and shoot at the sky ♪ I should be used to this life ♪ ♪ Who am I, useless ♪ So why should I even just try ♪ ♪ I'm trying to break out the coop ♪ ♪ Lead a flock, raid the roof ♪ Yeah, and go somewhere new in my mind ♪ ♪ I just keep shooting and dying ♪ ♪ Shooting and trying ♪ Double, I'm true to design ♪ I think there's gotta be something I ain't even seen ♪ ♪ Man, I ain't just no proof of the times ♪ ♪ Times ♪ Take me back to the West Coast ♪ ♪ Where the sun shines all day ♪ Weaving through the heart of Los Angeles ♪ ♪ To the San Francisco bay ♪ Take me down to the southland ♪ ♪ Oh, I need that humid air ♪ I put two feet through the old church door ♪ ♪ Holy water run through my hair ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ Freedom ♪ Got freedom on my mind ♪ Truth is I am free today ♪ Please don't true my mind ♪ Yes I do ♪ Yeah, freedom - [Skier] Yeah! ♪ True desire true design ♪ Got freedom on my mind ♪ On my mind ♪ On my mind ♪ On my mind ♪ Yeah, you can still be who you wanna be ♪ ♪ That's your difference, you got vision ♪ ♪ Even though some things go wrong ♪ ♪ You still so driven ♪ More transmission ♪ Just keep riding fast on that jungle pass ♪ ♪ Those thunder cats and your hundred miles ♪ ♪ This wonderland, long as you go the distance ♪ ♪ No provisions ♪ Vision ♪ Take me back to the West Coast ♪ ♪ Catch the sun before it sets ♪ I drank a 40 in the middle of your headlights ♪ ♪ Run your fingers down my leg - That was mad, bro ♪ My heart's forever open ♪ It doesn't matter where I go ♪ I got my roots deep in California ♪ ♪ But the road got into my bones ♪ ♪ Oh my, oh my my ♪ Got into my bones ♪ I said oh my, oh my my ♪ Got into my bones ♪ Freedom ♪ Got freedom on my mind ♪ Truth is I am free today ♪ Please don't true my mind ♪ Yes I do ♪ Freedom ♪ Truth is I am free today ♪ Please don't true my mind ♪ Freedom, on my mind ♪ On my mind ♪ On my mind ♪ Freedom [typewriter clicking] [gentle music] [birds chirping] - [Narrator] This small village in the Kootenay Mountains of interior, British Columbia has managed to harbor a rather remarkable secret. A secret that's been molded and nurtured by the community. By the almighty Ullr. And by the bountiful treasures of a throwback ski hill at the end of a 10 kilometer, dead end dirt road. But, it's a secret that shall be kept, no longer. The secret is this gentleman. - [Sam] My name's Sam Kuch. I grew up in Nelson, BC. - [Narrator] Chances are you've never heard of Sam Kuch. But, you're going to want to remember the name. Because this 21 year old is a harbinger of skiing's future. Ladies and gentleman, behold the wizardry of the Kootenay Kid, Sam Kuch. [intense orchestral music] ♪ They're in a time ♪ Between the keep ♪ A bell in the dawn ♪ Is sinking deep ♪ Forcing a burning love again - [Sam] Woo! ♪ Down down - Oh yeah.

What's good? - Oh yeah, she went! - [Narrator] A rather astonishing fact about Sam Kuch is that his remarkable whirly bird capabilities were nurtured out in the wild. - Yeah, I never really skied park growing up. Whitewater didn't have a actual terrain park. We learned all our tricks just from building jumps or hitting all the jumps around Whitewater, in the general like community was skiing with your friends and vibing off them, and we didn't necessarily need a park to learn what we got. ♪ Without you ♪ Fire ♪ Fuck you ♪ And I'll come for ♪ Without you ♪ Give you ♪ All my ♪ Of all this world ♪ Without you - [Sam] One of my good friends that I'll ski with is Trace Cooke.

Good day. Yeah man. They left the moon out. - [Skier] Ah, that was fun. - In grade five, I was graduating elementary school and we had to go up and show these posters of ourselves and introduce ourselves to the rest of the school and one of the things that I said in mine was that I wanted to be a pro skier. - [Baggage Checker] Going skiing? - [Sam] More and more my career has given me a chance to travel, and this year I've got the opportunity to go down to Squaw Valley. - [Narrator] Well, Sam certainly proved he had what it takes to shine on his home terrain. But, how would he fare in one of the worlds most legendary stadiums? Let's just say, the Kootenay Kid put on quite the show. [upbeat music] [man yelling] - [Sam] Yee! - [Spectator] Oh my God. ♪ Gimme danger, little stranger ♪ ♪ And I feel with you at ease ♪ Give me danger, little stranger ♪ ♪ And I feel your disease ♪ There's nothing in my dreams ♪ Just some ugly memories - It was my first time skiing there so I have these guys showing me around and the level of skiing was pretty high up there. ♪ Yeah ♪ Now if you will be my lover ♪ I would shiver and sing ♪ But if you can be my master ♪ I will do anything ♪ There's nothing left alive ♪ But a pair of glassy eyes ♪ Raise my feelings one more time ♪ ♪ Yeah [skier whooping] ♪ Find a little stranger ♪ Find a little stranger ♪ Say you're gonna feel my hand ♪ ♪ Say, gotta gimme danger, wild little stranger ♪ ♪ Honey, gonna feel my hand ♪ Swear your gonna feel my hand ♪ - [Narrator] Sam Kuch had no trouble assimilating with the denizens of Squallywood. That tends to happen when you're a likable, quiet, badass who comes along and does a few things that have never been done before. It's safe to say there's no shortage of that in Sam Kuch's future. Even his father is enthralled by the Sam Kuch show. - It's impressive, you know definitely. - [Narrator] Okay, that's an easy one. But, if we've left you with any lingering doubts whether this kid you haven't even heard of is one of the best out there let's take care of that, right now.

[skiers whooping] - Yeah, Kusher! - Come on. - Come on, that was so sick. - That was some heat. Probably the best year I've had skiing ever. In my short 21 years of life. Getting all these new opportunities and hopefully it just skyrockets from here. [typewriter clicking] [soothing music] - [Narrator] Mark Abma is certainly more familiar than Sam Kuch. He's a man with an iconic past. Having first starred in a MatchStick Film, in 2003. Shortly there after, he shook the ski world with an extraordinary segment that garnered him a claim as skier of the year. From there it's been a storied ride. Through nearly two decades for a gentleman who's been one of the sport's biggest senders and smoothest operators. Of course, for anyone with the slightest grasp of mathematics, that clearly means one thing. Abma is no spring chicken. The man is 39. - But, I feel pretty good, so I'm guessing it's working. [Mark chuckles] - [Narrator] But, with a youthful vigor and a penchant for taking care of himself, Mark Abma is unquestionably a legend, who's still got it.

Age surely hasn't dampened his spirits. Has it Mark? - I'm a pretty happy guy. And I'm pretty much happiest when I'm back here. I love building. I love getting my hands dirty and stacking rocks, and building cool things. And that's ultimately what really makes me happy and super stoked. This is my little Shangri La, back here. And, it's ever evolving and ever growing. Woo! [ethereal music] I guess I could call myself a bit of a hippie. I like thinking a little bit further out there. And we're all striving for that escapist type, simple living. We're gonna get innovative here. You're gonna love it Rubens. I don't really feel like I'm pushing myself anymore so much as I'm just enjoying myself. Yeah, you might have found me on the road pulled over like a kilometer, but. Which is why my whole objective now. I'm gonna do it just to prove you wrong, Rubens. Is just to shred pow with my homies. Share laughs and hugs and high fives. And go check out new spots that we haven't been before. - [Narrator] Well I look at it myself as the beginning really of a, of an exploration. That's the reason we're exploring. You don't know what you'll run into on an exploration. What the sky looks like. What the stars look like. Do they still twinkle or are they a steady light when you get outside the atmosphere? - [Mark] Boys! Share laughs and hugs and high fives. [skiers laughing] Shred pow with my homies. Yeah, yeah! Shred pow with my homies. - [Skier] Ooh, buddy! [upbeat sitar music] - [Mark] Laughs and hugs and high fives. - [Skier] Yeah. [skiers cheering] - [Skier] Stomped that landing, buddy. - [Narrator] As in all things. You must make your own way through life. - [Narrator] Well I look at it myself as the beginning really of a, of an exploration. - Hogi, Rubens and I, we're all kind of looking for the same thing. As we get older, we just appreciate those times were we can just escape from the responsibilities of life. - [Narrator] Stars. - [Mark] To a world of wonder and a place of passion. - [Narrator] Stars. - [Mark] Once were out there, it's just eat, sleep, shred. Shred pow with my homies. Shred pow with my homies. Yoo! - [Narrator] What the sky looks like. [skier yelling] What the stars look like. What the sky looks like. [skier yelling] What the stars look like. [skiers yelling] Exploration. Exploration. - [Skier] Classic OG. - [Mark] Shred pow with my homies. Laughs and hugs and high fives. Shred pow with my homies. - Yeah. - [Mark] We don't get to ski together that often. So how old are you guys now? [group laughing] We continually make a big effort to ski together at least once a year. I was just expecting to get laughed out of the industry a long time ago. - [Skier] But that was the whole point of this trip is if we just hang out together we won't make each other look bad. [laughing] - [Narrator] Exploration. - Start off slow. Taper off from there. [laughing] - [Narrator Exploration. - [Mark] Shred pow with my homies. Shred pow with my homies. Shred pow with my homies.

What the stars look like. - Yes. - Stomped it! - Yes! - [Narrator] What the sky looks like. - With my homies. - What the sky looks like. What the stars look like. What the sky looks like. - Into the next. - [Mark] I'm pretty frickin happy with that one. It's just an all day party. All week long. - That's why I'm tired. [all laughing] [typewriter clicking] [techno music] - [Karl] My name is Karl Fostvedt and I'm a natural born skier. - [Narrator] They call him Crazy Karl. - Yes, Dude. - [Narrator] Anyone with a nickname Crazy Karl, must be a special breed. - Yoo! - [Narrator] You don't just inherit or assume that kind of name. You've got to earn it. Funny thing is, this Sun Valley Idaho lad, earned it when he was just seven. He's always been the antithesis of the norm. When Karl Fostvedt clicks into his skies, no one knows what's about to happen. - [Karl] This is a real, here goes nothing coming up. - [Narrator] Many of you might not even comprehend what he's doing half the time, like it's an entirely different thing than what you and I are familiar with. But I suppose that's what makes skiing and the Crazy Karls of the world, so damn cool.

I was, like 3 months, pretty full on. [drill whirs] ♪ Think about it - [Karl] At the end of the day it's simple. I wanted a trailer because I want my front door to be at any powder paradise that I can get it to. You obviously want to surround yourself with people that are skiing in a similar way that your skiing, so when you show up in zones you can kind of work the terrain together. And figure out how to get the rowdiest in it and how to be the most creative in it. And so for me, like two buds that help inspire the most creativity are John Ware and Lucas Wachs. [upbeat rock music] It's always cloud nine when your going out with Lucas. He has an insane prowess on his skis an insane way of reading terrain and just like such a calm demeanor, but someone that you trust as a partner. ♪ Spirit warriors move softly ♪ All through the shade ♪ While the children are sleeping ♪ ♪ They surround the camp ♪ A delay in the song starts ♪ And through the end ♪ Chanting death will come sweetly ♪ ♪ As the wind, the bow, the stone ♪ ♪ Until the fields are red with ancient Merlot ♪ ♪ Heaven helps a friend ♪ Spotless and gleaming ♪ They dream past the tents - [Karl] My buddy John Ware is someone I've been skiing with for, coming up on 10 years now.

Drawn by a peculiar event in the alpine of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This congregation of pure stoke and convivial competition, held in the infamous Corbet's Couloir is a bonafide celebration of the send. [crowd cheering] - Yeah! - [Karl] I took first place. Won the title, King of Corbet's last year. And you know you get that taste of victory and I really wanted to go back and defend my crown. [rock music] It's every bit as nerve racking as last year, but a lot of really good energy up here. [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] There's one guys name on the start list that really caught my attention. And that was Travis Rice. - Let me get back to you. - [Karl] Yeah, Travis any thoughts on this one? - [Travis] I mean dude I think the left pop in has it better. - [Karl] Yeah, I'm on board with that.

[typewriter clicking] - [Logan] My name's Logan Pehota. I'm from Pemberton, BC. And I'm 24 years old. - [Narrator] The Pehota name might ring a bell. After all, Logan's been a rising force in free skiing throughout his adolescence. But the familiarity might just extend a few generations deeper. - Cold snow up top on Currie though. That looks pretty nice. - I'm sure a lot of people have heard of who my dad is. - Few sloughs coming out, but-- - [Logan] Eric Pehota, he's a big mountain legend. Pioneer in the back country alongside his buddy Trevor Peterson. - [Eric] I commandeered the young fellow to help me today which is a good hand. - Cause we didn't go heli. - Cause we didn't go heli skiing. [helicopter whirring above] Empty basket, no. - We're good. - Yeah, no skies in the basket. Gray bird everywhere. - No snow. Yes! [Eric laughs] Growing up with that. It's obviously morphed me into the person I am, right now. He's definitely taught me what to do and what not to do, when it comes to the mountains. My dad still goes out with me. Almost every day we go sledding. It's hard to tell how downhill that takeoff is gonna be. - Oh, its good. Get slough coming over where you cut across, I think you'll-- - I think he's stoked that I'm still skiing and doing what he does. - [Narrator] Doing what he does also involves competition within the tribe to establish dominance. - [Logan] Comp skiing compared to filming. - [Skier] Stoked, buddy? - Stoked, somewhat. - [Skier] Nervous? - I'll be more stoked when I get down to the bottom in one piece. It's definitely a different aspect of skiing. It's always the nerves up here. That's why I'm only doing one this year. Last year I definitely had, probably the best run on this face I think you could get really. - [Announcer] Logan Pehota - [Logan] Lets go baby. - [Announcer] Here comes Logan Pehota - [Announcer] Sending it over the corner. - [Announcer] With a big 360. - [Announcer] Facing this off the nose and does not hesitate, yes he will and the double. Oh yeah, regular chute style. He is here to get rowdy. - [Announcer] And off the nose is the hugest!

I don't know if I'll be making it up to that level again. There's a bit more rocks out this year, so. I mean I've got something lined up. - [Announcer] Coming into this with a big three. Logan. Another one and Logan clean through that one too. Two 360's on two massive airs. - [Announcer] And this is a big one too. Taking it deep into the tranny. - [Announcer] That was a huge run and we'd expect nothing less from the reigning champion here. - Got third in wildcard, so. [crowd cheering] So honestly what I try and do is just, go big. It's the funnest feeling, I think skiing. - [Skier] Well played. - [Narrator] The young Pehota has proven himself a competitive machine. It just so happens he is also something of a beast on a machine. [upbeat music] [motor roaring] Logan clearly has no qualms sending her to the moon. But has he gotten her upside down? - No I haven't backied the sled yet. But it's been like my main goal, ever since I bought a sled which was like four years now. - I think this has kind of been nagging at him for a while and he wants to do it. Get it out of the way so he can actually get on, back with his skiing and concentrate on filming. - [Logan] Little intimidated, but jump looks money.

Lasting stability, longly moving daylight, and the formation of glorious spines. It is here that Logan, Abma, Karl, and Sam needed to unite to take their games to a bigger and wilder arena, as a team. But questions loom. How would the rookie fare outside of ski area mini golf? Would the whirling dervish be grounded by terrain of consequence? Just how sendy would the big mountain slayer get? And could a man just shy of 40 hold his own, and survive amongst a pack of eager younglings? - Send it! - Send it. - [Karl] Well you guys will send it anyhow. - I'm feeling the send today. Got a new mouthguard, I'm ready to go now. Yeah buddy. - Nervous, stoked, excited, apprehensive. - Oh dude, I'm fired up. - [Narrator] Will these skiers come together as one and find the natural send amongst these celebrated mountains?

Damn. - [Eric] Yeah there's a gap in the trees. - [Narrator] These bros were not particularly familiar with one another prior to this venture, but they were quickly evolving into best mates. This was familiar territory for Abma, but for the others, gallivanting around in a helicopter day after day was not standard operating procedure. - This is my first real big heli skiing trip. - [Narrator] Sam Kuch was resolved to capitalize upon the opportunity. ♪ Please don't tell me 'bout your wrong and right ♪ ♪ Don't tell me to live you die ♪ ♪ 'Cause I can kill myself just fine ♪ - [Skier] We're go! ♪ Point your finger at another man ♪ ♪ Not even I know who I am ♪ I won't pretend I give a damn ♪ ♪ No one knows for whom bells tolls ♪ ♪ Just march along this way ♪ Wear your veil to show and tell ♪ ♪ 'Cause we got hell to pay ♪ Saints ♪ You're too late ♪ Pray to your Gods ♪ Deny what you want ♪ Light another candle ♪ 'Cause the good will never defeat the brave ♪ - Pulled a sender on.

[intense music] - [Skier] Yeah bud! Damn dude! - [Karl] That thing has some tang on her. - [Skier] Right, that was perfect. - Abma skied like a boss, man. [soothing music] - Pretty mindblowing watching him do stuff right now at the age he's at. I don't think I'll be doing what he's doing on skis when I'm that old. - Think the old man's gonna show us how it's done? - [Skier] Yeah uncle! Yeah! Oh! [skiers whooping] [soothing music] - Uncle Abma. Chucking buckets. Why is it so hard for us and so easy for him? [upbeat music] - Yes! - Yeah! - Good job bud! - Whatever reason we started calling him Uncle Abma. - I love being called uncle! - We're all kids. He's the uncle, he's the one with the experience. - Those kids are awesome. I'm proud to be their uncle. It became a tight knit family vibe. I got worried for them like an uncle would. - Yes, oh my God! - Oh! - That was a fan. - He's just one of the best ever, so to get a chance to get in a helicopter with him is a dream come true. - We've been doing it the whole trip, and it always seems to prove us wrong. - [Skier] Anytime you got a question about a line, trying to figure out which way to get in, which way to get out, go talk to uncle and he'll get you set up. - [Mark] That point you can make your decision. Go left, or right. - Okay. - All my best runs were runs where I was hanging out up top with Abma. - You got it brother. - All right. - Hell yeah. - Three, two, one, drop in. - [Mark] Yeah buddy.

But we aren't quite done. Within any madness of this sort, there's always going to be a moment, a fear, or even a hunk of rock and snow that stands above the rest. - Whole zone, like an insane stacked zone and there's this-- - Right in the middle. - You can't keep your eyes off that [bleep] donger. That's the definition of donger right there. - That's a punter. - Yeah. Step right into this one. - [Logan] Don't want to send it down into the abyss. Okay, rock paper scissors for the donger? - [Skier] Yeah. - I would've probably preferred doing that second. - The donger? - Yeah! - Let's do this. - I think I-- - And that's what I thought we were playing rock paper scissors for was for second. - Oh! - No way! - Rock paper scissors shoot. Rock paper scissors shoot. [Logan chuckles] - Woo! And when I won rock paper scissors like Logan, you're on bro. And then you called in on the radio. - [Skier] Yeah, Sam just won rock paper scissors so he's teeing her off first. [all laughing] - That's the winner. - He just rolled with it. - Yeah, I don't care. - Yeah buddy. - Let's [bleep] go buddy. - Three-- - Yeah here it goes! Okay bud! - Let's go! [ominous music] - [Skier] Oh, yes. [skier laughs] - Oh way to fuckin' land it, buddy! - Way too fuckin' big man. Oh my God. Speed was the hardest to judge. I came in feeling like I was going slow, and then went like 30 feet past the proper landing. - [Skier] So big. - [Sam] Yo Logan, you don't need quite as much speed as I had, so don't be afraid to corner a little bit down. - [Logan] 10-4, thanks for that. [dramatic music] [all laughing] - Oh boy, man. - Great success. - [Narrator] Ultimately, triumph on the donger. But the rookie's electrifying season warrants a fitting end. With that, we let him bid farewell with a final, radical send. [dramatic music] - Oh! Oh! Buddy! Yeah, good! - That was awesome! [skier laughs] Yeah! - [Narrator] As happens each winter when the magical crystalline blanket transforms the ragged alpine landscape, the mountains call out to our protagonists. The summoning did not land on deaf ears. - Yeah boys. - These gentlemen went. - Good times. - Yeah buddy. - [Narrator] And they sent. - [Skier] Life is dope, man.
