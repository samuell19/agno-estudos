Breathing, rhythm, and image. Do you understand? Yes. It's not good to lie. Yes, I don't understand. You don't understand, do you? Yes? Excuse me. Ah, Kanon-chan. I found a partner for you. Kikuna, right? You know each other? Got your feet firmly planted on the ground? The basis of your voice is your feet. Absorb the energy from the earth... Understand? One, two, Piano, louder. I'm not going for lessons. Mum's cowardly isn't she, asking you to ambush me like this. Your Mum is on her way to your old house at Aobadai. Why? Where's the piano? Where's Dad's piano? I'm sorry. Where's this place? This is - a place where old pianos sleep. It's like a graveyard. Yeah. But they're not dead. All of them are still alive. Choose one of them to save, Uta. Which one sounds the best? Uta, you can hear the crickets already. Continue playing. Today's weather is nice. Yeah, but it's a little hot. If it's hot, take it off then... I feel like eating out today... The pianist on this tape... is me. I played this piece during the time I was performing with your father. It was something we did between ourselves, It was partly just for a bit of fun. No, that was precisely why we did it. We could play so well because we were so free then. To date it's the best - how do I say it? the most ideal music I ever made. How many years has it been? How was Dad back then? Hmm? He had talent, as well as looks - He was a hit with the girls, heh. Of course, his music was also... Hmmm, not this one... Ah, found it, found it. Too bad he didn't get to go overseas. He had motion sickness. This was taken at the party we had on the ship, on the eve he left. He was leaning on the stern, as if he was going to puke. It'd have been better if he hadn't gotten on. What an idiot he was. On that note... The next time I went to the stern, he was gone. He wasn't to be found anywhere on the ship too. At that time, it was a good thing I made him come out of his room. I think it was an accident. Here. Thanks. Could you shelve these, please? Can you even read? Shut up. The same goes for you, what're you doing in the library? That's because I'm a librarian. It can't be helped. How diligent. Shut up. Scram. I'm going. Go away. I am. Hey, What, do you want me to stay or leave? My ear... there's something strange about it. Your entire existence is strange! I'm not falling for it this time round. Uta? I'm sleeping here tonight. What happened? Nothing. Hey, Have you heard of the piano graveyard? Huh? Such a place exists. What? I went there with my Dad in the past. It's not just pianos, but all kinds of old musical instruments. Aren't those second-hand instruments meant for export overseas? It's a warehouse. No, it's a graveyard. It's true. Dad's piano is there right now. I want to play that piano again. My Dad, he's dead. It must have been suicide. Why? I understand because it's me. It was painful for him to live with music. Good morning. Lichtenstein? Yes. May I? What complicated requests! It isn't even from the man himself. Who, then? It's from his specialist piano tuner. If he's that worried he should do it himself. I'm honoured to do it. It seems it's all about him, isn't it? Well, I'll try to meet the requests. Well, I'll leave it to you. Why did you stop? What're you thinking of? Uta... She said something weird. Naruse was worred about becoming deaf. Every year it would get worse. But, I don't really know what was really going on. At least, I never heard such a thing from him. Kikuna. Yes sir. I believe it's possible, to live for music. Well, let's continue! I got these tickets to Lichtenstein's concert from Prof. Katsura. "Listen to someone good" "So you can learn from him." she said. Uta'll be fine. You should worry more about yourself. Stop nagging. Anyway, Why won't Uta play the piano? She says it's weird if she hears herself play. It's a good thing isn't it? No, it's not that. She can't even stand being next to a piano now... It's dangerous. I don't get it at all. It's a common thing for girls of her age. Since you're a guy you won't understand. Is she that important to you? Ah, thanks for the ticket. The pianos are ready. He's asking, how old are you? 13. Choose the piano you think's the best. This one. ii musume da! are ni kimeta yo He's late. You can't trust men. You have to be suspicious of them. Even if you've slept with him once or twice, don't let your guard down. What're you talking about? Please leave me alone. Let's get some coffee shall we? We thank you sincerely for attending Lichtenstein's concert. We regret to inform you that we will be unable to proceed with today's performance, because Lichtenstein is feeling unwell. What! He's not performing again? It's the third time already. In his place, there will be a substitute pianist. The substitute pianist is Naruse Uta. Uta? Customers may get a refund for their tickets for half the price. Wao? Lichtenstein isn't playing today. What? There's a substitute! What? It's Uta! Eh? Uta? The substitute is Uta! Please! Definitely not. But it's such a prestigious event! No. It'll be fine if she just appears. Stop messing around! Definitely not. We refuse. Did you think I'd allow such a reckless thing? It's a song she's never played before, and with an orchestra no less! If she fails, she'll... Mika-san. Lichtenstein wants her to play. He won't allow anyone else but her to play in his stead. Nagasaki-san, can I have the score? What're you doing? Stop this! Do you understand? If you fail - you'll never be able to recover from it! Uta... What's gone over you? I just want to play. I'll do it. I need to pee. "It's that girl's time now." that's what Lichtenstein said. Hey hold on! I'm an acquaintance. You can't go in! I know her! You can't go in! Uta! Uta... Hold on! The seat's too low. Ah, forget it! (Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20) I'll be fine. Because I'm music. (Translator's note: "Uta" literally means "song".) Is she okay? Hey, watch out! That was close! You'll get yourself killed! Hey, Naruse! Coming. Is Uta here? Here you go. Here. Did you find her? The station staff saw a girl, who looked like Uta. Did she get on the train? Yeah, probably. But she wasn't alone. It seems she was with a friend. So it's not so bad if she isn't alone... If you're not there, Uta won't have a home to go back to, will she? She's stronger than her Mum thinks she is. There's nothing to do but wait. Hey, wait. We're done. How far are you going to travel? If you don't want to follow me, go home. Ow! Can you hear it? Yeah, I can hear. Your playing sucks.
