Well, I just need to get a prescription refilled for my dad. The one for his leg, he ran out a few days early. - He ran out? - Yeah. You know, 'cause of the cold?

Have you decided where you're goin' yet? - Nowhere, just here. Look, I could pay the difference, if you'd like. Between now and his next dose, it's not a problem. - Where is your father now? - Home, probably. - Look, Mickey, I would love to help you if I could. - Well, why can't you? - It's a federal offense. I'm afraid you and your father are just gonna have to wait. Be grateful there's only 30 days in April. - Did you know that some days I can't even get him to eat? Did you know that? You know what? This was stupid. - You know, Mickey, if you ever need someone to talk to. - None of you even give a shit, you're all fuckin' robots. - Okay, that's enough. - Let me ask you something. What would you do if your boyfriend took all your dad's pills? You know Hank. Do you think Hank off his Oxy is a pretty sight? No. No, you have no fucking idea. - Just make sure she's not your cousin this time. - I held her waist once, that's it. - One time, are you sure about that? Just the waist now? Are you sure? - Why don't you check Los Angeles, Church? - Yo, Annacompton for life, son. Born, bred and buried, you know it. - Alright, yo, what about you, Mickey? I don't know, probably just the same as Aron. - Alright, now give us a little smile. I need teeth. I'm not sure what you're channeling here. Okay, you don't smile, I don't get paid. Next! - I'm gonna die a little bit halfway through. - Yeah? As long as you make it about, I'll say halfway, then you're not gonna die. Give me a sec. Hey! Are you not staying? - I was just passing by on my way home. - I've never seen you pass by before. Don't you live up Cable Road? - How come you know where I live? - Well, I'm actually a London spy. I'm kinda like James Bond, you know? Well, anyway, you gotta stay now, because the away side has more of a crowd than we do. - Well, my being here's not gonna help you win, so... - That's where you're wrong.

Not that you're keeping track. - You're listening to me anymore. - Maybe I could use some of the cash from the bank account that you set up for me? You know, the one with the checks for Mom in it. - Sounds like a plan, sweetheart, better eat your dinner. - It's all horse shit, you made it all up. - You got somethin' to say, come out and say it. - Okay. Where's my money? - You want your cap and gown? - Where is my money, Hank? - Eat your dinner. - Or what? - You want your cap and gown? There's your cap and gown. It doesn't matter if you graduate anyway, though, does it? What're you ever gonna do with your life? - More than you. - I put a roof over your head. - And I'll be out of here as soon as I fucking can. - Put clothes on your back. - And you'll be stuck here. - Eat your fuck... - What're you gonna do about it, Hank? Are you gonna sell the house, move to Niagara Falls, get a ranch? You can't even pay for your own fuckin' beer. - You think I'm a loser? - No, Dad. I think you're a fuckin' liar and I think you're a phony. You think that you put this fuckin' roof over my head. Where's my money? - Where's my fuckin' life? A ranch in Georgetown. Ranch in Georgetown and horses. - Hank! Hey, Sheriff, can I talk to you a second? - Give me a minute. - Where is he? - If you need anything, just pull your caller. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, sweetheart. - What happened? - I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. - I'll get you some water. - Hey, Mickey. Don't leave. I got no one else. Don't leave me. - Of course I'm never gonna leave. - When I found out I was gonna be a father, I had all these ideas of where it was gonna go. It wasn't supposed to be like this, darlin'. I wasn't supposed to be like this. - Hey.
