Cinema fund Andreevsky Flag Film Company If there was a force in the world that would return everyone connected with the gold territories: those who died in the routes, lost on the mainland, all of them would repeat these years. Not for the sake of money, as they knew what money was, while working in the Territory; not even in the name of duty, since the real duty sits in the essense of a person and not in verbal terms. Not for the glory, But for the exploring the unknown, in the name of what the individual life of a person is started and passes for. Town. Main Geological Department of "Nothern Construction" 5902 km from Moscow Over the past thee years, gold production on the river has sharply declined. In the 1958 we reduced our production by 500 kilograms, and last year we lost one and a half tons of gold. There are no new depsits discovered, gold reserves increase is insignificant, and, if it'll go this way, heads will fly off, first of all mine. And all of you will have a sad, joyless pension. There is a plan to reduce all expenses except gold expenses. For example, territory, Comrade Chinkov, tell me why we need tin territories? Just in case... By the way, comrade Sergushova, a journalist from Leningrad, will be writing about the search of gold. anyways... Where was I? Why do we need tin territories Indeed, why do we need tin territories? It is proposed to close geological department there. I don't care about Buddha, Territory is only one of seven departments. It can be closed. Especially since it's a tin mining province. And no one here believes in the gold territory. You can believe or not believe in ideas, But gold is a quite material thing. It is possible to know about the existence of gold or it is possible not to know Unfortunately, we know nothing about whether gold is in the territory or not. Chinkov wouldn't listen any further. He remembered the smell of dwarf cedars, the smoke of forgotten bonfires and victorious confidence of happiness. They think it's the Chinkov's end, and he hasn't even started yet. It's time I will not give you the Territory. Ilya Nikolaevich, I want to write about the gold of the Territory. I am glad, but you just heard that there is no gold, and there can't be any. I will write about gold of the Territory. 11th of June 1958 No one has ever seen gold mined on the Territory Konstantin Lavronenko Grigoriy Dobrygin Kseniya Kutepova Egor Beroev Evgeniy Tsyganov Vladislav Abashin Pyotr Fyodorov Visual Effects Ilya Starovoytov Editing Ekaterina Starovoytova Sound director Makar Ahnashev Artistic director Eduard Gizatullin Make-up Lizzy Lowson-Tsays Costumes Gulumzhan Beyshenova Director Maxim Malinin Producer Anton Melnik Music Tuomas Kantelinen Director operator Viktor Griniakin Script Alexandr Melnik Mikhail Aleksandrov Based on the novel by Oleg Kuvayev Alexandr Melnik's film T E R R I T O R Y Settlement Geological Department of "Territory" 1410 km from Town This is what summer is like this year. And to the south in the mountains the larch has already blossomed. Heinrich Furdetsky was appointed head of the Territory just a month ago. Bosses thought that if Furdetsky was nothing, then settlement will still be OK while Chinkov is there. And if he is a personality, it is useful to have him as a counterbalance to Chinkov. I am listening to you, Ilya Nikolaevich I'm staying You already got a call, right? So, I am staying in department. So, we will work together. I am always glad. If you will stay on my way, I will destroy you. It's in your interest to join my team. What do you want? Very little. Don't play behind my back. All messages to the Town by mutual agreement. I am performing production tasks, You - providing resources. plus economic part, housing, supply... Everything according the statute. I advise you not to think, but to agree. ... And what is this phenomenon? I went to the hostel. Boys have been in tundra for two months already, and the ice in the corners has not melted yet. Not boys but geologists! This will be concern of the head of department Furdetskiy Of course, you have much greater concerns: Project, laureate and banquet. Autumn will come, the boys will come back. I will choose muself as the chairman of trade union. and I will declare war on you, Padishahs. I thought I'm not able to be surprised anymore Tell Kutsenko Tomorrow we depart to the Mongolov. He'll be glad there. Ilya Nikolayevich Chinkov, nickname "Buddha", got on the river when he was young engineer. There Chinkov created the foundations of the legend to come, where ruthlessness to himself and others was multiplied by luck. His expedition opened one of the largest gold placers in the country. But a half year ago he suddenly reported to head of "Northern Construction" Chinkov requested to be transferred to small geological department of Territory on the shore of Arctic Ocean. Elgai river valley Eastern search party 270 km from Settlement Hello, Vladimir Mikhailovich, comrade chief! What do you got? There is nothing in this pit but my salary. How much did you find? We've reached the eight meter. Kid is washing the samle. Since morning. Comrade Mongolov There are two strangers approaching They are going confidently and they have an alcohol in the backpacks :) I don't see it. Comrade chief! If you'll give it away, I will drink and dance Indian dance named Ganga. What's up, kid? All washed samples deliver to the base by twelve. Oki do, chief, samples will be delivered without delay Vladimir Mikhailovich, I will bring everything. Hello Ilya Nikolaievich! Hello Vladimir Mikhailovich. Meet Klim Alexeevich Kutsenko. Best washer of Nothern Construction Alexeevich, arrange a tea and fish soup for us. Vladimir Mikhailovich, tell me the truth. Would you believe in industrial gold on Territory? I don't believe in industrial gold in this place Chatter and vulgar hype Lunch! Comrades geologists, welcome to lunch. You don't have to wear pants, right? Sorry, there is only one bottle, so... I hope for your deep alcohol integrity. They're carrying samples, I'll take a look Well, Vladimir Mikhailovich? Do you think it is necessary to check the upstream? Check for the gold... Search on both inflows I don't think so. The party has approved project for tin. There is no gold here. Local gold signs can be washed in the Moscow region. We have tin mining province. And tin and gold are not compatible, even a student knows this. Well, I am not a student after all, I'm Chinkov. Don't use painted stream. It keeps the sample worse. Yeah, right, painted. But how did you...? And when you do, But how did you...? And when you do, don't drain out using corner. use plane and make circles... Right, I am draining using the corner, I like it more. There are no particles. I believe there should be particles in these soils. Three years ago my old friend Misha Katinsky was a party chief on the neighboring river. Tundra devil threw him samples with weight gold in three pits. Katinsky reported about reorientation his party to gold. After that, he did not find any gold in any samples. Then they harassed him. It is tasty So, where are your people? Baklakov should come back today and group of foreman Salakhov went on a multi-day route. By the way, Back they will be rafting through the Katinsky area. If you're interested. I just have to figure out where is cositerit. East of us is the Vatap river basin, we know nothing about it. In this regard, do you want to step over the Vatap river? Lets say, send your Baklakov for exploration? Boats needed for crossing and route to be taken by the group. Yes, I was living well that time. With machine gun. The border guards gave it. And with horse named Galya. The horse is good, but can't wash the clothes. Are you Baklakov? I am What would you think about single route for 15-20 days? Can do, normal. There is no normal way to do it... Route passes on granite massifs, it will be necessary to take many samples. To the Vatap river and further to Ketomsk Highlands. it is 500-600 kilometers. I'll do it. And how do you think to cross river Vatap? I don't know, I have to look at it. Yes, apparently, this route is what you need. Go to bed. We will make a decision together with comrade Mongolov Vladimir Mikhailovich We need to talk... Let's go. Vladimir Mikhailovich, I agree with your decision to send Baklakov to multi-day route, right decision. Sergey, bring Dahmer map in a pack box, under the table, red. What is this circus for? I was afraid that you will argue, and I though I'd put you in front of the fact You could have just ordered. Then I would take responsibility, and department doesn't need now any emergency situations related to my name. Are you afraid of responsibility? Come on, Vladimir Mikhailovich. Take a look around, it is "Nothern Construction", people like me are not judged here. I'm "Buddha". Why do you need this route, Ilya? Here you go Where from? It is washed upstream on your river. Kutsenko has the rarest sense for gold I have a feeling, Vladimir Mikhailovich, that there is a weight gold in your pits I am confident in my washers. You can check, it's your right. Salahov worked in Katinsky party for two seasons. It was Katinsky who made him a washer. Three years ago in this place Salakhov washed the famous samples, gold nuggets of Katinsky. These nuggets broke the Katinsky's fate. Salakhov felt guilty. Why are we standing in a rusty place? It is nothing here. These are the last samples, finish up and we'll leave. Bear with me, God of fire. I tolerate I caught a little cold, Sorry. Up the river Elgai. 67 km from Mongolov's base I noticed this place a long time ago, when we were going to the base. It is my personal request, Klim Alexeevich I understand. Wash to the last water, all the way to the end. Then go to Mongolov base, they will be waiting for you there. i will pick you up myself. But don't tell anybody about this. The heart was tapping its 60 beats per minute. Blood ran smoothly and powerfully through the veins. Around him there was created already that special coziness, that accompanies a stray man everywhere. Beautiful coutry of colorful tundra, dark mountains and bleak sky. Beautiful loneliness of a man on a route, among unexplored mountains and valleys. It's great you'll never die. (and that he is immortal Baklakov never doubted for a moment) There are no any limits or borders. There goes a normal eternal life. Seraya river. 92 km from Mongolov's base. For the first time in his life, Kutsenko was executing not an order but a personal request of Chinkov. That's why he gave all of himself to the work. Destiny brought him and Chinkov together in the postwar years. For the three years, he was mercilessly trained by Chinkov. Made him guess even before washing whether or not there is gold in that place. But Kutsenko got a taste for it himself. Tray became an extension of his hands and he dreamed about trenches, scythes and shallow water. His star ascended when he was making the route along the creek of Hope. that creek was declared empty by other washers. Kutsenko was busy on the creek twice as long and washed the gold. With Chinkov's easy hand, he then became Klim Alexeevich. Would be nice to have now a mug of spirit. and piece of venison. I destroyed myself because of this alcohol. Now I live on a promise. Have you been treated? No, by myself. When my woman died I stopped drinking. Will you start drinking again? No. I need to raise my children. I have two of them, Mishka and Tos'ka I already took them from orphanage They live with my sister now. I send all my money to them. They are writing to me Daddy, come here Ilya Nikolaevich is right the land of great opportunities... I will not give you the Territory. Tramps doesn't need home and comfort. They need ocean and fresh air Vatap river. 98 km from Mongolov's base. What stars of Big Bear sings to them? We don't know. Not you and not me. The ocean is great and the land is great. Got to go through everything. Big Bear from far away wishes you a luck on your way. Seraya river inflow into the Elgai river. 57 km from Mongolov base. God of fire was tormented by the imperfection of his own life. He didn't have a son Mishka and daughter Tos'ka and he was never married. But the dream of living like all normal people was so big, that he was confusing dreams with reality. Why there are so many people who wanted to live and couldn't? And somewhere the star fell from the sky like the tear from the face. And trouble has come to your children a Big Bear Friend, let's paddle harder with our oats. O, wave, spare the swimmer. Big Bear, bless me, Big Bear. The captain is strong, and the sailors are strong, while their hearts are beating. Big Bear, lead the way, Big Bear. Shepherd Qyae's camp. Somewhere on the Territory. Many people have passed by Qyae over the years of his life. He liked to think about them, about the words they said. Some people smelled sweat, Even their thoughts smelled like work. He respected them. Others smelled of money, he felt sorry for them. He was angry when good or bad life was talked about. It just happens to be different. It's funny to think that money can improve it. Qyae's memory stored the smells of herbs, ice, spring snow, the fly of the frozen crow and his hoarse scream over the snow, falling of the shot down wolf, taste of deer meat. And Qyae's memory daily and hourly kept sad recognition of the inevitable change of rain, snow and human lives. What amazed him most was the inevitability of replacement. It is impossible to stop it. Mikhailovich... How are the samples? Chief Engineer visited us and showed the gold which they washed upstream our river. Katinsky had the same. We spend five days washing at the old Katinsky base... Nothing, no gold nor tin. Chinkov is sure that we should have weighted gold. What's happened? What's the matter, say it straight. The day when Chinkov came, three gold plates came out in seventh sample. Honestly, I don't know how this gold slipped in my pocket. Thought I will put it in the letter and send to Sonya. With Sonya we studied together at school. I went to circus school, thought I'd impress her. And she said that's like became a waiter... She liked Jack London's characters. Thats why I am here... I wrote her a letter about gold at once, that I work with the tray. And then she started writing me long letters. I put the gold in my pocket just before you came. and it was already late to return it. Sedoy called me a bastard because of you I threw gold plates in the river. It's a shame boys... they throw nuggets in the river, sons of bitches. Is it your gold? It is gold of the state. Criminals. I am ready to be punished. What?! Do you want to go to court? break your life? Fine Only we know about it. No need in complicity, Vladimir Mikhailovich. It looks loke complicity in crime... Get out! Redeem with work Tamara, did you hear the gunshot? I don't know. Perhabs, this shot came from the distant hills of time. It sounded many years ago, and now it's back. Or maybe it came from the future. I guess so. Next morning Mongolov went down the Elgai river It was a proof of thesis known to all searchers: When the area is empty, you need to work three times more to prove it. Cinnabar hill he found by accident. Nobody expected cinnabar on the Territory. Mongolov discovered mercury deposit of world significance. Speaking Chukchi language Is anybody alive? Geologist... got sick. Geologist? Good. I'm a shepherd, I know you're sick. I heard the gunshot, I see a tent, A man doesn't go out in the morning, not going out in the evening. A man doesn't go out in the morning, not going out in the evening. Clear, he's sick Is it far to the camp? One and a half hour for you. Perhaps, you should go, If you will stay alone, you will die. You'll die for sure. My name is Qyae. Elk river. Far survey party. 316 km from the Settlement. Well, boss... No icons here, There is nothing to cross over after the road... Tired... Shouldn't I take a bath? I wouldn't mind coffee and cigars either. What would you say, Apryatin? And it would be good to know who is sleeping with Jeanne Bose at the moment. And what news about flying saucers? It's here. Human skeleton and this. I think it is Soyuz Gold, second expedition. Don't forget to give radiogram. Do you think we should call the police? We are obligated to do so... Although I would have done the ritual myself. Tomb of the unknown sufferer, tundra mystery. We came out from the clay, into the clay we will enter... That's a sad outcome. Tamara was sitting naked, according to the old custom of women of their tribe. Naked body was common in their lifestyle. It was rational and good for the health. Qyae liked that granddauther kept the ancient customs and allow the body to breath. Eat, eat Eat in the morning Eat during the day, eat in the evening and in the night... Go when you'll fill the power My granddauther will take you to the trail. The deer is walking, the bear is walking, and geologist will pass. Party chief Zhora Apryatin in public tried to keep ideal image created by his imagination: terse, always armed Zhora Apryatin - polar wolf. Nature really was making Zhora in the image of viking, but around half way down the road it got distracted and the rest was completed by his grandfather, who was a famous geographer and researcher of Central Asia. Report, Apryatin. Skeleton has been found at... This you will report to the Major. Report about results. What Results? Can a helicopter fly there? No, impossible without refueling. On foot? Two days... Major, have you made a decision? Let the bury and draw up an act. The matter is clear. And, please check how explosives are stored at the base. What would you tell about gold in your area? Yanovich choosed our area to check the... I don't care what Yanovich was up to, it is not a science test polygon. Listen to the order, Apryatin: By autumn you will give me a full report about gold content of your area. Party has an approved project. I don't care about the project, I am closing it. What are we arguing about? We work mainly in mountainous area, We have to go down to the tundra, check upstreams of main watercourses, to wash quickly for heavy fraction, stop the trenching and transfer all manpower to sampling. Two or three view lines on the main creeks, and nothing to argue about. Sound reasonable. Please don't ever yell at me. Secondly, please give precise instructions on how to search for gold. And I request written order about project cancellation, I can't change work plan without it. A geologist engineer is not just an engineer. He must have a code of honor. Your collegue died while searching for gold in the Territory The results of the work are not known. And in order to fulfill an elemantary comradery duty, you require a piece of paper? Demagogy Demagogy is what you're doing now. You heard the order. Gurin will tell you How to fulfill it. And your grandfather should be ashamed of you now, Apryatin. He played you beautifully, Georgiy That's the boss. He has a mind and a target. and there is absolutely no bias called ethics. He is a bad man. You got flogged. Take it like a man. And remember, Fops are known in the endgame and sufferers take the fall. What do you want to put: a cross or a column? You decide. You are cynic, Andrey, it's disgusting. I'm not cynic, I'm an isolated philosopher. The administration of the territory was famous for one thing - geologists considered it Old Believers of geology. Legs - the means of transportation, Geological hammer - a method of cognition. Everything else is from evil. The principles of Nothern Construction were sacred here. And the main principle was created long time before Northern Construction by Joseph Conrad. It was like a short precept - Do or die. Half of them have two or three deficit professions. Half of them are jewellers in their field. When they are sober. Take the ones I give you And the main thing - there were no cases where a stick could make a human be a human. Materials are submitted, log is filled, Check in. I'm glad to see you, Sergey! Barrack 25 will be ready in a week, not quite ready yet It's OK, I will live on the construction site. Write the paper, I'll get my stuff. Let's go to my mining site, engineer. I will give you an accomodation, salary, can take a woman with you. You are probably dreaming about naked girls... Many roads lead to the capital of Soviet Lithuania and stretch from the city to its surroundings. From the east and from the west, from the north and from the south everywhere we see a landscape typical for the surroundings of Vilnius. And always, going down to the valley from the mountains that surround Vilnius, we admire the beautiful city and its surroundings. Boss, To make a pits in autumn when permafrost flows, You should be stuck in this clay. And to be holded one day in the wet hole Fenix, only plebeians think it's happines to lie up your ass and do nothing. Am I not a plebeian? I am a plebeian. You are working in the Arctic, there are no Plebeians in Arctic. But in your opinion, who is ditching the pits? Are the princes dig on the ditches? No, boss. We don't understand idiotic orders Tomorrow is the last day of work, in the surroundings of Vilnius. Ha-ha That's enough! Consider it an ultimatum. Finish the dinner, lights out. Yes What is it? Well, since we are the only residents of this unfinished house, i would like to ... Is you the one who threw out the compote? I needed the jar I brew tea in the jar, it tastes different. And who are you? Sergey Baklakov, geologist. I came back from the field today. Every evening somebody is trying to get in with cognac... Today they will not try, we will defence. I am hungry like a homeless cat or dog. Like a homeless Catdog. And what is your name? name? Venerable comrade Sergushova That's who I am Go for the compote... Whoever you are, either climb in or close already... Vasilchikov Konstantin Sergeevich, tank tester, in the past. Chinkov Ilya Nikolaevich, gold digger. Well, what? You got sick in there too? No need. After we freed Austria from the nazis, I served for a year in a special group. Collecting technology. Appartment owner Frau Louise every morning served coffee to my room... and cream, in separate cup. By the way, real Chinese porcelain. Women... They know how to brew coffee in Vienna. Yep. My son would have turned twenty today. The war started, and I was digging for a gold here... I couldn't get back to them in Leningrad. The curve of live. You never knows where is the hidden crack. Small load and that's all... Song from "The last inch (1958)" You need to fry without oil, In no case do not close the lid and remove immediately when venison will turned white. You're clever at it. And I don't know how to do anything. It's called pasteurized venison. Geologist is a kitchen profession in general. Why do you stare at me like that? I'm just hungry It is not proper to look at a person when he eats. First time I see myself as a feeder. It's nice when I feel good with people. Well, better tell me more about heroic stuff. Have you had to stand by the bump or river and dream inspiredly: here will be a town? Who am I, an Imperor? Our type at best can dream like that: Here will be three drilling rigs, ten tents, and half a hundred guys. Good evening... Why are you so spring loaded? Did you bring a medal or resolution? Will you fly? Yes. I will try to quickly arrange vacation and everything else. Yes. I will try to quickly arrange vacation and everything else. Come in the morning. Keep in mind, the road will take around 5 days. Bye... Zhora Apryatin's people rafted down the Elk river in rubber boats During late winter when all tudra terrain irregularities are blown out with snow and cemented by frost party is thrown into the mountains by airplanes. In autumn, when it is impossible for aircraft to land on the rocks, there are two ways to get back: by tractor trains, if possible, Or by rafting down the river to the ocean. where they are picked up by any available water transport. the latter option is the most dangerous. Many geologists tragicaly lost their lives completing the season this way. After completing the washing Kutsenko went to Monolov base. If Ilya Nikolaevich said that they'll be waiting for him, then they're waiting for him. The frost below thirty degrees hit sharply. Rivers got frozen in one night. Zhora Apryatin was suffering from colds and realization thet the work is done badly. Samples photography failed. Idiotic order of Chinkov is executed but nothig was found. Zhora knew that Nothern Construction doesn't recognize objective difficulties Consequently, he is responsible for the gaps on the map. Official project is almost ruined and there is nothing in return. I am - the tin digger. All my life I was working with cositerit. The issue with the mine is negotiated. Its not gonna happen, Vladimir Mikhailovich. No vacation and no mine. We need you here. I suggest you lead the exploration for scatter gold. It is not serious, Ilya Nikolaevich. I won't, I won't take part in this. What If I will order? First time in my life, I will reply to the order with medical paper. Don't make me do this. My heart is not feeling well, I'm flying to Moscow the other day to visit a doctor. Please do not subit a request to Furdetsky until I return. Thank you for the cinnabar. Ok, I will wait for you to come back. Vladimir Semenovich, Thank you. ... Hold on, guys... Do not drown the samples! Gurin was not on the boat, He was performing elementary comradery duty, buried the remains of a geologist. then he went to whalers cape by legs. They were to be picked up by Eskimo boats. Good day, people! Ended the route without single corpse. And who said we can't? We can, for sure. Let's celebrate the end of season! We ready for everything for you Drink with us, doctor. You are strong person. And your Chinkov is strong as well. But where would you be without us, workers. If you will excuse me, I'll have a drink later, alone. Once in Central Asia I climbed to one, almost inaccessible, pass to drink there 50 grams of cognac, to look at the world from above and think about life. Why did I do it? The answer is simple. Delusions of the centuries. The desire to prove one's identity at all costs. "I'am not like the others" You will die... What are you talking about? Just, the seal on your face. Nonsense. The main thing is to keep a distance. Follow the rules of navigation in busy areas. That's the secret. The boats are coming. Keep calm comrade, We still have a long way ahead, Even if the trouble is like night bell tower spire in your chest. Do not confuse the end with demise Dawns trumpets like before. Your sadness is not a reason but a single step forward for you. We walk these scratched old steps through the woe, separations and tears, we walk with the impatience burried in the eyes washed by winds. We saw the night dreams, at the porch of the nothern mountains. We swinged the forest stars on the black eyes of the lakes. As a Nothern Construction custom, Geologist had three days for "bania" after returning from the field. On the fourth day, the one should come to the department exactly at 9 AM, shaved, well dressed and absolutely sober... Hello, woman You are welcome. Will you live here? What about Baklakov? Aha, Baklakov... Baklakov is... left to his family residence, to the village Is he your friend? I only have buddies, like everyone else in our time. I lived with Baklakov whole previous winter. He is comfortable. A simple soul, he is only busy with his muscules and geology. Doesn't talk about beautiful things and women. Yes, he is very good. He's charming. A simple soviet fanatic. And who are you? I'm the penultimate adventurer. Why the penultimate? It would be a shame if I'm the last. Cognac? Cognac Cognac should be drunk from gold-plated tableware It's the only way it gives color. Where this cognac is from? Buddies are sending books, beverages, LPs to make shure I don't fall behind. I smoke only cigars, like Churchill. I would like to live to a deep old ages, to see how it all ends. What exactly? I'm sorry, it sounds so much like an interview. What exactly? Journalist? Respect that. What will end? Total intoxication: appartments, clothes, cars. Buyers take over the world Well, to hell with them. Here's to your career. Let's drink... Do you want a matrix of any journalism on local topic? Yes. Ice, snowstorm, enthusiasm, snowy spaces, young zeal, old nomad. This is already mine speciality. I respect it. I respect the job. And my neighbour and collegue Baklakov respect the job as well. All of us respect the job. So that is what you are. I am not them, I am separate, wanderer. And how do you manage to be a wanderer? I am PhD, I know my profession on the average Doctor level. I know two languages. With this luggage I'm welcome guest everywhere. If I get bored here, I'll find a point on the map and move there. Moving allows you not to have things, it's more convenient. Don't you feel empty? I feel sad. In the past, the world was invaded by Chingiskhans, Tamerlans, Makedonskys Now it is tightly and inexorable invaded by the buyers. They are everywhere from the lake Titikaka to Mozhaisk. It is the most ruthless invasion. I adore interesting people buyers outlawed them. So, I adapt. I want to stand for myself among this intoxication I don't want to have anything except myself. Stunning guy! Stunning guys are in the cafe and drink port wine through a straw, playing life burners. No, I'm still penultimate adventurer, but I'm working not worse than these arctic supermen. Do you want to look at them? I want to, how to do it? night of fielders: heroes of tundra wih the bottle of wine. uninitiated are not allowed, the treasure for a journalist. Are you inviting me? You, to the fielders night? Speaking french language. Ivan Egorovich, this field is of world significance. Mongolov claims that mountain almost entirely consists of cinnabar. They brought a ton of it. Simply walked along, picked up from the ground and brought it back. Is that why you flew to Moscow? Rabyking already called twice. So, you don't believe it, do you? What is it? Take a look for yourself. It's a nonexisting gold. Did you washed it using tray? Coarse fraction... What do you want, Ilya? Money, a lot. And more money. Did you come secretly? Yes, and this gold is secretly washed as well It is not on the river like in the school book It is diving placer and it can't be found without big survey. With the money we will give a new field. Do you want another laureate? Another laureate is certainly not bad. I would like, before I died from the third heart attack, to say myself that I am not ashamed of my life and I did everything I was meant to do, or at least tried to do so, yes? What did you get the decanter for? Just like that or... hmm? Where did Chinkov go? For two days I can't communicate with him, over. Newly received rovers have proved their worth in arctic offroad conditions. Polar explorers say thank you. Comrade Rabykin, over. Where is Chinkov? Over. Flew to the hospital because of the bad heart condition. All field parties have returned safely, comrade Rabykin. Over. Furdetskiy, are you building autonomy there? Over. What kind of autonomy can there be, comrade Rabykin? I will send preliminary report in a week to you pesonally. Over. I wish the management team success. Over. Baklakov was late, father died three days before his arrival. All the good father's things he gave away. He left himself a big album with family photos. Now Baklakov understood with undeniable clarity that the only thing he had from now on is a room on the shore of Arctic Ocean and his home is the Territory. Well, bye. Read old Ramberg, it will be useful for you. Let's talk, Andrey Problems with the report? Almost there. Logic is simple, Your position is not sad, but rather happy Because you have a right to write non standart report. I'll be serious, have you read the reports of the classics: Mushketov's, Obruchev's, Bogdanovich's? And what have you been studied for six years? Classics were writing geological novels. They were writing an essays with variations of their hypotheses, but were not lazy to describe the landscape in such a way, that you soaked up the atmosphere and their way of thinking. Okay, but what to do with chapter "Minerals?" What you are not lacking is a stubbornness. I suggest you write a geological essay. Free play of a mind. with a personal concept of globe structure in our area. And then "minerals" will take treir places. Try to understand, why Buddha rushes to the gold. And keep in mind, Buddha will not make a step in a vain. He is the only smart man among you supermen. Stop bullying. If I will see a sacred fire of thought in your eyes, I'll make your petrography. I agree. By the way, I owe our journalist friend a dozen of champagne be so kind to visit her in the evening. No, I will be busy. Up to you. Maybe after nine. Baklakov spent the whole festive week in the office, working on the report. On the flat sheet of paper there was a four-dimensional world of movements of earth's strata, cracks crushing them, deep magma explosions, the violent madness of volcanic eruptions. violet Triassic field, presumably Paleozoic massif in the east. In the south , the green tick strip of Ketunga Highland effusions. He has to imagine the story. Fault lines, somehow his mind was always returned to fault lines. They have mountain passes on top, they are adjoined by river valleys and ridge breaks. Magma is using the fault lines to penetrate and form the terrain. Why he needs a fault lines? And suddenly he realized that it makes no sense for him to sink into the sea of facts now. He can't hide behind little things now. The power of prophets in their moral certainty. He must give a basis. Details will be later. There is a gold, at least because there are signs everywhere. It's a fact. It was brought by granites. It is also a fact. In any of the granite massifs no one saw the ore gold - this is a third fact. Baklakov took a piece of paper, a pen and suddenly, instead of a conceived list of questions, started writing a letter. He wrote a foolish letter: about a tramp he knew, who was lighting a cigarette through a magnifying glass from the polar lights. about cocroach Sema, who lives in the crack above his bunk. When he finished the letter, he understood quite clearly that must be a special type of granites, still unexplored, In this case one should expect gold deposits along all rivers of the territory. This night he found the main thing. intuition and confidence. He knew he's right. Good morning. Good Where have you lost, why do not you come to me? Gurin made a notes and asked me to pass them to you. He's staying in my room, very busy with the report. You looks happy and blue, some kind of colored. Who is Tamara? Tamara I had a good night today The joy of the coming summer suddenly woke up in me. According to the Mongol, I have reduced the amount of evil on earth. Oh my God, You can become a philosopher soon under the influence of Gurin. But you don't need to be one. You are a simple, clear supeman. They can write about you in newspapers. Go to the tundra, look at the people. Mongolov now have not people but the screws. Hammer won't hammer them and pliers won't pull them out. They are the ones to write about. No, these screws are not the ones we need, we're not supposed to write about them. We need them to come here for romance and to have a clean past. I'm bad journalist, I can't write other way. Yes, they are not clean people but they are first in the places where others will then go for romance. Maybe they'll build a town, maybe not even one. but understand, you can't build a city on the empty place. A worker named Kefir should appear here. His biography is certainly not the life of saints, But there is not hard work without Kefir and no Kefir without a hard work. Maybe this is his hollyness. You know, Your duty is to be a very good person. Why? There are people which has much more difficult life than others. others get away with many things, but they don't. And they are obliged to be better. If the person has decided to live his dream then he is doubly obliged to. Why? Because majority of people are scared to live their dream. Source of Elgai river. Eastern survey area. At a depth of 10 meters. That's the other bosses think: the Worker took the advance, took some booze or simple port wine, drank and sniffing quietly in two holes. But the bosses of the production does not sleep. counting the minutes, worried How can they sleep when everything can collapse at once? And what is a production? Tell me, Sedoy! That's right, it is like a tree, The workers grow it. The bosses are asleep - the worker calmed down. We can, guys. Yes, we can. Is there more of it? You have the lucky eye - go down! Toilers! Honor is given by the right hand. When you hear the March, the step begin with the right foot. Anti-aircraft guns shooting upwards. And the boys did not try in vain, didn't slack. Here you are, Vladimir Mikhailovich. Where from? Line 430, pit 8 on the 10th meter. Maybe alcohol? We can't take alcohol, we'll scare off the luck. By the law of miners. Kefir Start the boiler, we need washing, winter washing. We can't wait until summer. Lower line washing did not give anything. Testing pits were empty Mongolov ordered to transfer the boiler to the next line. Second line gave nothing as well. The spirit of failure hanged over the party. Where is the pattern, Mongolov thought. Nugget of the egg size it is not signs already, it can't happen by accident. But mainstream of gold mining is not a nuggets, but a sand and a dust. Sand and dust should be found by washing. Mongolov has already been captured by excitement. He realized that chief engineer's plans should go much further than Elgai. I read your report, Sergey Alexandrovich. In your thoughts there is unconditional sense. I suggest that you think over the route and organization of the ring party. I suggest you to be a party chief. The task is to go along the borders of territory and write a report with forecast of territory's gold contents. I will be a co-autor of the report. Kutsenko will go with you as a washer. take Gurin as a surveyor. I don't have contact with Gurin for personal reasons. In the Elgai valley there should be exactly the type of placer traps you described in your report note. You guessed it, and by the way, I think your findings are true for the entire territory. I suggest you to head the most difficult and important party in the department. I need a project in one week. Keep in mind, Baklakov, Whatever would be complexity and duration of the route you have thought about, it will still be not enough. And another advice. As soon as the route will be clear to you, take the plane and spread the provision barrels. Only you is responsible for the results of the party. I am not interested in the methods you will use to do the job. It is my business. Your concern is to have a red-hot brain develop the ideas and immediately coordinate them with the force of reality, which in simpe words is called wisdom. I obligate you to be ruthless and wise in everthing that concerns the gold of the territory. Your future depends entirely on this summer. I wish you luck. And don't make me disappointed in you I believe in your strenght. Find the good place to camp. Provision in a second batch. Let's load the detonators Boss, we have an extra space. Let's put provision. Provision is for second flight. Transportation of detonators and explosives in one vehicle is strictly prohibited. I am responsible by law. I can fly. Boss, are you a newbie? Plane is not a donkey? You can load everything on the donkey. Finish the loading. We are done already. And what is it? It is food. Everything happens in tundra. Last year I waited two weeks for this plane. You don't go there to eat, you go there to work. The plane went and return safely, but strong blizzard started by night. The weather calmed down only on the seventh day. Having raced to the airfield, Apryatin found that the only airplane suitable for the flight was captured by Baklakov. Apryatin only had to pray that Baklakov will not damage a plane on his idiotic route and that those two would have a courage to wait. Salakhov and God of fire don't have a food. Apryatin didn't say anybody about it. But he understood that if Salakhov and God of fire will die, all he will have to do is to shoot himself. Six barrels with provision and one with rubber boats for the upcoming heroic route of Baklakov were filled, sewn with wire and loaded into the aircraft. Baklakov transferred from his map to pilot's map all places where it was necessary to to throw out the barrels. Kutsenko flew on a postal plane a week before. His task was to rent or buy a boat there, transfer it by tractor to the Seraya river source and preserve a base there. Now we'll sit down quickly, pick up your Kutsenko and go. You'll never guess if there's wind on this cape. Hello, Banners cape! Earth! Senia, you are a slacker, you could at least hang your pants up. Do it our way, with the fire. I will make another lap. Are you alive? A craft with your collegue crashed today on the Banners cape Everybody are alive, it is unknown how long the repair will take. You don't have to stick around here anymore. Patient! You have a visitor. Come in. We have generatoe only untill 11. I will bring you a kerosene lamp then. Well, have a good conversation... How did you know? When you will be 18? Will you marry me? Next year, I will. You are kind and strong. But you are not beautiful now. So, what are you waiting for? There was no weather and there is no plane now. I though about you a lot, Apryatin Your grandfather asked But if your people died, I will send you to the trial Go to the radio and send a message to the Town about urgent need for a medical An-2 on skis. Do you believe in God, Apryatin? I am Komsomol member I was praying these days. Pray, Apryatin, pray. Salakhov Won't you eat me? Where have you been, boss? You are my breath and my early morning. You are the burning sun and the rains. I will exhaust myself and would become the best. on this occasion you need to wait. because of that you need to wait Wait, and keep yourself safe. I'll become the most beautiful. I will become the smartest and the biggest. I've been thinking for years How can I find my Star? But my star put backpack over his shoulders and went. and went. My star put backpack over his shouders and went and went. You're my melody, You look like you and you look like me. My lighthouse near the eternity on the edge. The people will ask again, how you feel about him. and I will sing this song as an answer. I will sing this song as an answer... Katinskiy passed away, Mikhail Arkadievich. Quiet! Katinskiy passed away. Misha Katinskiy looked to the world from the wonderful heights of high moral truth And we are living and dying, It's a shame, so many evil in the world. It means the common task of people and your task in particular is to eliminate evil. In a war time, take a sword or machine gun and in peacetime honest work shold become elimination of this evil. This is the ultimate meaning. What is the probability that cat Vas'ka will type the tale of tsar Saltan on the typewriter? one to three billions The possibility of you leaving with me to the party is within this probability. And no editorial tasks will help. There's a cold that you can't hide from, mud and cursing. Sometimes there's nothing to eat, after all. I can't No more moping. look at the world with different eyes Do something useful. Write a novel. About us, about supermen. I give you the first line: On the shore of the Arctic Ocean, watching the sunset and melting ice, two tramps are standing. Go already To love you is like to dive into an ice-hole. it's fun and scary To love you is not more useful than to wait yesterday to come today To love you is not more useful than to catch the wind in the field. To love you is like to present myself to the steep rock. To love you is to forget all others. What can be better in this life? And secretly from you cry out like a wolf from an eternal pain. To love you is to drink a water in the desert and still be thirsty. And to become rejected one day. To love you is like swimming in the sea, where the waves are whipping away. Truly, to love you is impermissible luxury. To love you is so dangerous, As in the mountains, crawling, sliding. But, my God, you are so beautiful, That it is impossible not to love you. Nganay hills. Circle survey party. 305 km from the Settlement. Congrats on your arrival in the party, boss. Do you know how to ski? We can The king of Kavgolovo hills is me. Did you go south? Of course, boss. just found granite ... at the watershed perhaps just the tip of an unpassed magma. Perfect contact, ready-made laboratory. But clean-up needed. I am waiting for a wise guiding word. Study everything. take Sedov with you, he is trained in mining. And give up on these skis, it will exhaust you. The Valley of Three Icees. 158 km from Settlement. Mongolov took young wife with him to the party Uncle Kostya took her to the village a few days later. Good Morning! Good Morning! How are you, frozen? And you were afraid. It's okay. Coffee? Sertainly not the same like in Vienna... Coffee... Jesus Crist! I grew up in Sokolniki. By the age of ten, I knew everything about humanity. And I've seen happy people. If for every lost tramp there will be no smart and strong person, then humanity won't worth a penny. But humanity mean something actually. Fishes, where do fish swim? It's dark in the water, they don't know where to go. It is necessary to light fires for them So they could see. No one should live in the dark. Light up the fires in the Ocean. Uncle Kostya was injured in February 1945, in the battles for city of Budapest. Shrapnel went through. Small shards stuck in the ribs. but one of the bigger ones broke a rib and stopped in the heart. Shard did not bother him, The shard was moving slightly only in moments of strong experiences. Listen to me... don't be afraid, they will be looking for us. And they will certainly find you. You must survive. Land mine is ringing with heavy bass, fire fountain hit. Bob Kennedy went to the dance. What business do I have of all of you? and you - of me? Motorists are not allowed to go to a route without a tent, primus, sleeping bag. week food reserve... the earth cracks like an empty nut. Armour cracks like the wood splinter And Bob again laughing himself up. What business do I have of all of you? and you - of me? That's all from my side. Sergey Alexandrovich, Gurin broke his legs. How? On his mountain skis. Sedoy said skis are completely destroyed. Both legs are broken, spine seems to be intact. We should go. There are arctic foxes, like rats, they will eat him What about gun? I took the gun from him, Gurin out of his mind, shouting and crying. I put Sedoy to sleep for now, we need to go in two hours. Baklakov hated Gurin these minutes He made a decision: He will run to the radio himself, he will make 170 km in two days to save the legs of a neighbour. Small Kitam Valley. 168 km to meteo station. As always, when decision is made, Baklakov felt relieved and now he felt sorry for Gurin. If Gurin will lost his legs, it's all over for him. He is not the kind who could remain human without his legs. Qyae God sent you to me again. Did you forget? When you flew that airplane, we made an agreement. I got everything and left on the base. My engineer broke his legs. I know. they told me about it on the base. We need to transfer him to the meteo station. it is 170 km through the mountain pass. and then the plain will pick him up. I will transfer him. Small Kitam Valley. 51 km to meteo station. Gurin saw himself clearly from the outside in the set of actions, words, accidents and natural facts. Aphorisms of others and his own-made, proud self-removal, Andrey Ignatievich Gurin, high grade specialist, isolated philosopher. And he is lying down now in a stupid valley of a stupid river and illeterate shepherd riding deers to save him. For Baklakov it was important to combine the borders with Zhora Apryatin's route and work methodically every minute. Marau hills. 432 km from Settlement. I will go for two days, Wait for Apryatin. All of us are doomed people. We are doomed to our work. Desert fathers and virgins, beauties and millionaires, Everybody doomed to their role. We are doomed to work, and this is the best and highest doom in the world. Sedoy, plans changing. We found gold. Wait for Apryatin and come back to the base. Hey, where are you going? Sergey! Congrats on arrival. Well, Vladimir Mikhailovich, you will get money and more people. But Rabykin continues to struggle for liquidation of the department. They want to create extended survey party for tin instead of us. And they want you to be the boss. Tangled knots need to be cut immediately. I will continue survey for the goldб using all my experience as a mining engineer. There is gold on the territory and I know it. And I know also that we will find it. Hello, Comrade Chief! Hey, the man of an exceptional alcohol integrity. He was the one who found the nugget weighing 350 grams. Is it a feat, Vladimir Mikhailovich? Are you keep talking that I refused the alcohol? It is not to frighten off the luck and not to undermine the currency power of the state. Igolov heroically rejected the alcohol offered to him. Was it? Yes, correct. You have a rich fur coat. This coat would be good for Broadway. American chicks will lie down. Our power is not in the coat... First man in the space! Our soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin is in the space. Hooray, comrades, hooray Moscow speaking. We are transmitting message about the first human flight to outer space. Our concern is simple, Our concern is that Of needin' long life for our motherland And haven't other concerns The snow, the wind And the nightfly of stars My heart calling me to an uneasy distance Let trouble by trouble Threaten to us Our friendship will die But only with me The snow, the wind And the nightfly of stars My heart calling me to an uneasy distance Till i can walk, Till i can see, Till i can breath I will go straight on The snow, the wind And the nightfly of stars My heart calling me to an uneasy distance And as the all others before you, You will find your love sometime She's will gone through the storm with you Bravely, as you The snow, the wind And the nightfly of stars My heart calling me to an uneasy distance Don't imagine that all songs is sang That all storms is gone To be ready for the great aim And the glory will find you The snow, the wind And the nightfly of stars My heart calling me to an uneasy distance Chinkov's vision came true, they discovered a node of gold-bearing placers. All this was happening in another century and on the other land. Based on the novel by Oleg Kuvayev If there was a force in the world that would return everyone connected with the gold of territory: those who died in the routes, lost on the mainland, all of them would repeat these years. Not for the money, as they knew what money was, while working in the Territory; not even in the name of duty, as real duty sits in the essence of a person, not in verbal terms; not for the sake of fame, But for the exploring the unknown, in the name of what the individual life of a person is started and passes for. Maybe the point is that in the moments of doubt past years would support you? when you weren't cheap and knew the rudeness and beauty of the real world, lived like a man should. Today is the consequence of yesterday's day and the reasons for the coming day are being created today. so why weren't you on those tractor sleds? and not your face had been burning by that frosty February wind. Where have you been, what have you been doing all these years? Are you happy with yourself? Dedicated to our parents who realized their dream of a great and happy life after the war.
