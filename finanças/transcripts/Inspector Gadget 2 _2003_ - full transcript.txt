(MUSIC PLAYING) Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Aha. Wowsers, it's quiet. Too quiet. And when it's this quiet, you know what that means, brain? (WHIMPERS) Evil's afoot. (GADGET SNORNING) We're on a stakeout, Gadget-mobile! No, you're on a stakeout. I'm on a sleep-in. So keep it down, a'ight? The least you could do is stay alert. Alert for what? Face it, inspector g, since we locked up claw, all the bad guys have been too afraid to show their faces in Riverton. One thing I've learned in all my years of crime fighting, gadget mobile, is that it's always the most quiet right before the criminals strike! And speaking of crime... (HUMMING SOFTLY) Potential law-breaker at 12:00! Who, grandma over there? Go, go, gadget radar gun. (WHIRRING RAPIDLY) No, no, no. Go, go, gadget radar gun. (BUBBLING) Oops! There go those glitches again. No, radar gun! Radar gun! (JINGLING RAPIDLY) GADGET: Ah, the speed limit is clearly posted at 25 Miles per hour, but she's going exactly 25.3 Miles per hour. Prepare for high-speed chase! (SIRENS BLARING) (RATCHETING) Hang onto your pockets, 'cause here come the rockets. (BOOMING LOUDLY) (HUMS) (SIRENS WAILING RAPIDLY) (MOOS) (GASPS SOFTLY) Oh, my! Stop in the name of the... law. That went well. Go, go, gadget parachute! (TIRES SCREECHING) GADGETMOBILE: Whoa. Now, how is that for disc brakes? Go, go, gadget parachute, back in the thing. (GADGET EXCLAIMING) (CLEARS THROAT) (SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING) (BRAKES SQUEAKING DEJECTEDLY) Ma'am, do you know that drag racing on public roads is illegal? But, officer, I... there are not buts when it comes to the law. I'm afraid I'm gonna need to see your driver's license. I'm sorry, officer. I must've left it at home. Yeah, a likely story. Go, go, gadget handcuffs. (SCREAMING) You have the right to remain... Silent! If you give up... Coming through... that right... unh! My man really needs to switch to decaf. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (GEARS WHIRRING) (DUCK QUACKS) (EXPLODING) (RATCHETING) GADGETMOBILE: Okay, one sweet granny packaged and ready for delivery. GADGET: Drag racing indeed. I've seen your type before. You've got a need for speed. Yes... I know. PENNY: Hey, Uncle gadget! Hi, brain. (BRAIN BARKS) Penny, I thought we agreed you'd call me "inspector" in front of the hardened criminals. She's a hardened criminal? Don't be fooled by appearances, penny. Look what I found in her purse. Probably from one of her victims. And look at this. Liquid evil. But, but, officer... save it for the Judge, Perp. Yeah, but, but, but. Everybody's got a big but. Hey, what are you doing here? Isn't today a school day? Well, there aren't any good cases to solve at school. I want to solve real cases... with you. Penny, I told you before, you're too young to be chasing criminals. You should be in school. But, Uncle gadget, if you'd just give me a chance... look, I have to go. I'm in the middle of a big arrest. Now you get back to school, and I'll see you tonight. And you, I hope you like prison food. Mm, mm, mm. BAXTER: Now, let's see how your Physiobiometric febble fitzer is functioning. (BEEPING) Oh, diagnostics check out fine. What seems to be the problem, gadget? Baxter, I'm still having gadgets with my glitches. I mean, glitches with my gadgets. I'm all messed up. Sorry, gadget, I don't see what the problem is. Watch. Go, go, gadget toothbrush. (PUMPING) GADGET: See? Bubble gum. I see what the problem is. Isn't there something you can do for me, Baxter? Well, you're the prototype gadget, gadget. There's bound to be a few glitches. But you'll be happy to know we've been working on it. I'll let you in on a little secret. Soon, we'll be unveiling something... -(BEEPING) -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) Soon... that'll solve all these glitches for good... soon. Wowsers. Thanks, Baxter. Well, better go check in with the chief. Oh, I wouldn't bother the chief right now. I heard some idiot arrested his mother this afternoon. CHIEF QUIMBY: Where is he? Gadget! Oh... You put my mother in jail for drag racing? And driving without a license. You've always said, chief, no one is above the law. This is what you also said last week when you arrested that troop of girl rangers for selling cookies! (FLASHBULBS POPPING) Those cookies were 3 days past expiration date! (QUIMBY EXCLAIMING) -(GROANS) -Oh. You are this close to being put on probation, gadget. Now, let's get my mother out. Heaven knows what's happening to her down there with all those lowlifes. And then, when his guard is down, his kidneys are exposed, and that's when the marathon of pain begins. (GROANS) And who's your grandma now? (GROANING) Take some of this! How'd you like this? -(CONTINUES GROANING) -(GRUNTING) GADGET: Wowsers, that's gotta hurt. (MAN YELLING) (GRUNTS) Mom's tough love. This is your last warning, gadget. Stick to solving real crimes. Chief, there are no real criminals left. They're all in riverton prison. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (TELEPHONE RINGING RAPIDLY) Gadget here. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What? Uh-huh. Wowsers! You'll never guess what happened. Claw escaped. Claw escaped? Police have put out an all-points bulletin and are setting up a dragnet in hopes of finding the fugitive. Citizens are advised that if they see an evil genius with a claw, not to approach him. Dial 911 immediately. He's extremely dangerous and really, really mean. And I'm on the case. Bye-bye, penny! PENNY: Wait, Uncle gadget! You gotta let me come with you. I mean, I can help you look for clues... I told you before, penny, you're too young. How old do you have to be to be a detective? I don't know. But older than you are now. Look... I've got work to do. I'll see you tomorrow. Don't forget to brush your teeth. (KISSING RAPIDLY) (SIGHS) I could do so well if he would just give me a chance. (WHIMPERS, BARKS) Well, my finely honed instincts are telling me that he probably escaped through here. Oh, really? Gadget, take a look at this. We found this in claw's cell. Wowsers. You don't think he's still holding a grudge, do you? Gadget, listen. The whole city is counting on you. Go out there and catch claw. Oh, I'll catch him. Caught him before, catch him again. Don't you worry, chief. I'll have claw back behind bars before you can say... QUIMBY: (SCREAMING) Gadget! -(GROANS) -Hmm. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) CLAW: Brick, retrieve my darts! Huh? (GROANS) CLAW: Mckible, serve my tea! (GROANS) MCKIBLE: I don't see why we gotta retrieve your darts and serve your tea. Yeah! We're vicious minions, not valets. (SCREAMING) Heh heh heh. One sugar or two? Two. Here, boss. BRICK: Dr. claw, this place is a dump. What happened to your multimillion-dollar high-rise evil headquarters? What do you think happened to it? (BOTH EXCLAIM) CLAW: When gadget arrested me, the police confiscated all my assets. But after we've pulled off the crime of the century, I'll be back on top again. Great... another crime of the century. I'm still on parole for the last one. What's the plan this time? Watch and see. NEWS ANCHOR: The federal reserve bank, with a deposit of over 5 trillion dollars in pure gold, was built 2 years ago after riverton was declared statistically the safest city in America. Utilizing the latest in security technology and a squadron of armed guards, the bank is considered impregnable. CLAW: Not for long. We're gonna rob the federal reserve! Right before Riverton's eyes, and there won't be a thing inspector gadget can do about it. How we gonna do that? They said the bank was impen... (GROANS SOFTLY) Really hard to get into. Yeah, I don't see how. That's why you're just minions, and I'm an evil genius. He's got a point. Yeah. We are going to build the ultimate super weapon. But we haven't much time. We need to be ready in 10 days, because next Thursday at exactly 9:23 A.M., the x-force one satellite will be directly over riverton. And by then, we need to steal ion fuel cells, a Protoid Laser, and a Ruby, plus a few miscellaneous knickknacks. Yum. I love knickknacks. (GROANS) (REPORTERS CLAMORING INDISTINCTLY) Any news on claw's escape? The city's in a panic! The people want to know. What are you doing to capture claw? Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous day for us. (GLASS BREAKS) Huh? Mayor: The gadget program has helped make riverton... Thanks a lot. Hmph! The safest city in America! Ha ha ha ha! Bob! Thank you, mayor. We weren't going to unveil this until next year, but in light of claw's escape, we decided to move up our timetable. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Chief: Baxter. This is gadget model 2... or "G2" for short. The latest, most newest generation in the gadget program. (BEEPING) (CROWD GASPS) (BEEPING RAPIDLY) (TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING) G2 reporting for duty. Sir! (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Wowsers. BAXTER: She's similar to the original gadget, but she's completely, entirely all robot. (DREAMLIKE MUSIC PLAYING) Not to worry, g2, I've got everything under control. Oh, inspector, you're everything I ever wanted in a crime-fighter. (PRISONERS GROAN) Mmm. (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING) (SUCKING RAPIDLY) GUIMBY: Gadget. Gadget! (MUSIC FADES OUT) Gadget, could you give me a hand, please? Certainly, chief. I want to give a little demonstration of what G2 can do. Pleasure to meet you, miss... 2. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Hmm. Must be a loose wire or something. I'll speak to Baxter about that. G2 will now show us how she would apprehend the suspect. Gadget, I want you to take this stolen money and hide it on your person. Stolen money! Stop this felonious and unlawful act, or I shall have to use force. Well, she has got a very commanding voice. (WHIRRING) (BEEPING) ROBOT VOICE: Alert, suspect, suspect. Very well. You were warned. (FLUTTERING) (GADGET GROANING) Whoa! Okay! Whoa! Oh! (GROANS) Huh. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up this right, anything you say can and will be held against you. All right, G2, I think we get the picture. MAYOR: Bravo! Bravo! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen... well, she is very good. I noticed that she didn't say "go, go, gadget." That's just one of the many improvements I've made to G2.0. Like it? You might say that G2 is you without the glitches. I'm putting her on the claw case right away. Fantastic. I always wanted a partner. And when we interrogate criminals, I'll play good gadget, and you can play bad gadget. I don't think so. Okay, then you play good gadget, and I'll be bad gadget. G2: I appreciate the offer, inspector, but I work alone. But, chief, the claw case is my case. You can go back to cracking speeders on the highway, gadget. There's a new sheriff in town. (LAUGHS) Hmm? PENNY: Uncle gadget? Uncle gadget, is this true? They're giving the claw case to this g2 character? Well, for the time being, but don't worry, penny, I'm being reassigned to another high-profile case. What could be more high-profile than claw? It's top secret, penny. In fact, it's so top secret that they haven't even told me yet. Hmm. So, what are you making there? Well, I'm just making your favorite dessert. Apple crumb cake with raisin cinnamon icing and coconut sprinkles? Okay, I'm making your second favorite dessert, lemon pudding. So, um, since you're off the case, I guess you wouldn't want to see this clue that I found about claw. Clue claw? I mean, a claw clue? Is it a clue about claw? Take a look at today's classifieds. "Wanted"... "Apply 7 P.M. tonight. Call 555-0139 for appointment." Well, I've already got a job, penny, but thanks. No, I checked the number, and it's for a bar called "the blue monkey." You know what this means, right? Hmm. Uncle gadget, if you go to the blue monkey, I bet it will lead you right to claw. You can get back on the case and get a jump on g2. You know, penny, if I went to the blue monkey, it might just lead me to claw. Then I could get back on the case and get the jump on g2. That's what I was just saying. Oh, did you? Well, I guess great minds think alike. So, we'll leave right after dinner, right? No. Nope. I'm sorry, penny, but this is official police business only. But you gotta let me come with you. I mean, I can help you. Penny, this is no place for a kid. I'm not just a kid, Uncle gadget. Of course not. You're a very special kid. But there's more to being a detective than just being smart. It takes a sharp eye for every detail, every little nuance. A good detective never lets anything get P... Uncle gadget, the pudding! -Ooh! Uh... -(PENNY SCREAMS) (SQURTING) Go, go, gadget, stop beater! Okay! (LAUGHING RAPIDLY) Everything's fine! (MIXER STOPS) (GADGET EXHALES) Ugh. Well, it's a good thing I wore an apron. (MUSIC PLAYING) GADGETMOBILE: Okay, here we are. GADGET: Wish me luck. I'm going under cover. (PEOPLE CLAMORING INDISTINCTLY) Hmm. (GROWLS) Hi, there, fellas. (GRUNTS) PENNY: Okay, brain, the coast is clear. Come on, let's check around back. (BRAIN GRUMBLES) (CLAMORING) (SPITS) What do you want? Well, I just got out of the slammer, and I'm looking to wet my whistle. What'll you have? A nice tall glass of milk. Milk? I mean, chocolate milk. Make it a double. -PENNY: Hey, brain. This way. -(BRAIN WHIMPERS) (BRAIN PANTING HEAVILY) MCKIBLE: Okay, then. Let's see what applicants we have here. -Squint. -(GROWLS) -Jungle Bob. -(GRUNTS) And you must be the one they call "the ninja." "Ninja"? Why do they call you that? Hyah! I think I see why now. Okay, then. Judging by this, you guys are prime Minion material. (GULPING) Hoo! I have a history of hair loss in my family. Anything else I can get you? Yes. I'm looking for... Sorry, we don't serve lobster here. What? No. Doctor claw. Claw, huh? Well, if you want to find him, you're gonna have to grease a few palms, if you get my drift. Well, whatever you say. Here you go... top grade axle grease. Why, you... Go, go, gadget duck. (GROANS) Whoa! (CRASHING) -(BIRDS TWEETING) -(GROANS) -(YELLING) -(CRASHING) Check, please. Just the check. (MEN ROARING ANGRILY) (BEEPING) So... When do we start working for Dr. claw? MCKIBLE: Immediately. Did you hear that, brain? (BRAIN GROWLS SOFTLY) (GASPS) (GADGET YELLING) Come on, guys, let's talk about it. Oh, man. (YELLING) You're stretching my sweater. Help, Gadget-mobile! Help! Oof! (SNORING RAPIDLY) (SIRENS WAILING FAINTLY) The cops! Come on, this way! Come on, let's get out of here quick! Move it, move it, move it! (MEN CLAMORING INDISTINCTLY) BRICK: We can hide at my mom's house. That was close. (PUNCHING RAPIDLY) Ooh, I can see you're upset. Hey, look, I'm knocking his block off! (BOTH CACKLING) Mommy... Coo-coo. Coo-coo. Coo-coo. Stop this felonious and unlawful act, or I shall have to use force. Ooh, look, boys, Malibu Barbie here is gonna get rough with us. (MEN LAUGHING EVILLY) G2: Very well. You were warned. (WHIRRING) Wowsers, she's good. (MONKEY CHATTERING) (MEN SHOUTING ANGRILY) GADGETMOBILE: Man, lucky for them guys I wasn't in there, 'cause I would have been on them like ugly on a mini-van. Well, thanks for the backup, G2, although everything was under control. I had those toughs right where I wanted them. Inspector, what were you doing in that bar dressed as a... what exactly are you supposed to be dressed as? I'm a hooligan. Huh? I went undercover to follow up on a valuable lead concerning where's Claw abouts... I mean, claw's whereabouts. I'm in charge of the claw investigation now, remember? Look, G2, maybe we just sort of got off on the wrong foot. (GROANS) Oh. Perhaps we could have dinner sometime... you know, just to discuss crime-fighting strategies. Imagine how great we could be as a team. We could call ourselves "the g-force" or "the g-team" or "the 2 gs" inspector gadget. What up, g? Even though I'm not programmed for such emotions, I admit I find you strangely... Likable. Hmm. But as I already told you, I work alone. And so do I. I'm just saying that maybe we could work alone together. Penny: You don't even know who I am. Think about it. No, really. You can't arrest me. I'm one of the good guys. Really, I am. Oh, hold on. She's with me. Penny, what are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to stay home? Well, never mind that. Here, look what I found about claw. MCKIBBLE: Dr. Claw's pulling a little heist tomorrow night at the concentrated industry's warehouse. Wowsers! We'll have to have a stakeout. You mean, I'll have to have a stakeout. Hey, this is our case, lady. (GROWLS SOFTLY) Penny. I know. You told me to stay out of it, but, well, I did find you this clue. Look, penny... I know you want to be a detective, okay? But this following me around all the time just isn't going to fly. (EXCLAIMS) Uh... Gadgets! Hi, chief. Gadget, what are you doing in a barroom brawl? (SMASHING) Looking for clue claws. Claw clues... clue about claw. And I was right. We just got a valuable lead. Yeah, a very valuable lead. We have evidence of a possible heist at concentrated industries warehouse tomorrow night. Great work, G2! You can stake it out and catch him red-handed. GADGET: Fantastic. I'll bring the doughnuts. I already told you. You're off this case... both you and Nancy drew here. Hey! -Pbbt! -(BRAIN BARKS) And you're off the force, too, if you get within so much as a hundred yards of that stakeout. All right, fine, but if claw gets away with his plan for world domination, don't come crying to us. Remember, gadget... 100 yards! GADGET: 99, 100... 101 yards away. I'm at the stakeout, but I haven't violated the chief's orders. See? At the stakeout... not at the stakeout. Stakeout... not at the stakeout. I don't think the chief is going to see it that way. Go, go, gadget binoculars. (BEEPING) My, she certainly is well-equipped, isn't she? Ooh, gadget's got a girlfriend. Gadget's got a girlfriend. Don't be silly, Gadget-mobile. Our relationship is strictly professional. (HEARTBEAT THUMPING) Besides, she's state-of-the-art. I'm last year's model. A few extra Miles look good on a player, and you are a player, g. You're tricked out with more factory extras than the Batmobile. Just show her that it's all good under the hood, a'ight? I have no idea what you just said, but I'm sure that if I were a car, it would have been very helpful. All I'm saying is, you got to show her you got what it takes, man. You're right. You're right! Thanks, Gadget-mobile. Well, I guess I'm just gonna go on up to the roof and scope out the situation. GADGETMOBILE: You go ahead on with your bad self... ha! I don't know what that man would do without me. Heh heh. Hold on, there. What do you want? We got a delivery. This ain't no food warehouse. I'm gonna need some authorization. (GUARD GROANING) Will that do? (BOTH LAUGHING RAPIDLY) We're in, your Claw-fulness. CLAW: Good. Now bring me the ion fuel cells. Yes, sir. G2: Halt! SQUINT: Oh! It's the mechanical meter maid! I'm real scared! (LAUGHING) Good one, squint. Uh-oh. Looks like G2 could use some backup. Stop this felonious and unlawful act, or I shall have to use force. No problem, love. Catch! (GRUNTS) Huh? (SHOUTING) (GROANS) (SCREAMS) Ooh! She got the kung fu. (YELLING) (GROANS, YELLING) I'm gonna give them a little bit of the what for! That's right. Go, go, gadget helicopter hat. (BELL RINGING RAPIDLY) Stupid glitches! JUNGLE BOB: Come on! Come on, you! (ROARING) (SCREAMING, LAUGHS) Whoa! Ohh. Hyah! Whoa! (SCREAMING, GROANS) (GONG RINGS) Wowsers, she sure is limber. BOTH: Huh? What is that? I don't know. Oh, I don't like this. (WHOOSHING) Oh, no! (BOTH GROAN) (BEEPING) MCKIBLE: Hurry it up, bonehead! Go, go, gadget something to get me down there. Wowsers. I never knew I had one of these. G2: Stop this felonious and unlawful act, or I shall have to use force. Oh...(GROANS) You imbecile! ROBOT VOICE: Suspect, suspect. G2: Very well. You were warned. Gadget to the rescue! -(GADGET GRUNTS) -(G2 GROANS) (IN SLOW-MOTION) No! No! (THUDDING) What are you doing here? Well, it looked like you could use some help. Quick, grab the fuel cells! Let's get out of here! They're getting away. Not to worry, g2. I'll get us out of this. Go, go, gadget scissors. QUIMBY: Gadget! I told you specifically not to go to the stakeout. That's not entirely accurate, chief. You told me not to get within a hundred yards of the stakeout, and I posted myself exactly 101 yards away. Then how did you manage to get tangled up with me inside the warehouse? Well, you gave me backup at the bar. I thought I'd give you backup at the warehouse. I never need backup. And until we find out what claw needs the fuel cells for, all of riverton is at risk. Chief, you have to put me back on the case. The department needs me! That's right, gadget. The department does need you. And I've got just the assignment to take advantage of your unique abilities. (CHUCKLING) Go, go, gadget power brush. (WHIRRING) (BRUSH STOPS) (WHIRRING CONTINUES) Come on, come on. I'm stuck. Go, go, gadget turbo speed. (SCREAMING) (BUBBLY) Go, go, gadget stop! Stop! (SCREAMING) (CONTINUES SCREAMING) (GROANS) (EXCLAIMING) Be careful in there. That toilet's got quite a flush. (CLAW CACKLING) Looks like gadget has finally found his true calling... Roto-rooter man. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Hey, Dr. claw, check this out... an unlimited supply of bowling shirts. And shoes! (MEOWS) (SCREECHING RAPIDLY) (MINIONS SCREAMING) CLAW: Silence! Everyone, pay attention! Who can tell me what we need next to build my super weapon? Uh... CLAW: The laser... a new experimental Protoid laser that's being unveiled at the riverton science convention. But to take it, we are going to need a little diversion. -(CLAW CACKLING) -(BEPPING RAPIDLY) Hey, Uncle gadget. Penny, shouldn't you be in school? Uncle gadget, school was over an hour ago. Oh. I'm sorry, penny. Oh, hey! This came for you in the mail today. Looks kind of strange. "Inspector gadget..." "If you want to catch Dr. Claw" "be at the science convention tomorrow." Wowsers! He must have really bad handwriting to go to all that trouble. Or maybe he doesn't want you to identify his handwriting. And, look, it's signed "anonymous concerned citizen." Well, it's good to know that we still have a concerned citizen who's willing to get involved! This smells like claw. (SNIFFING) No! Why would claw want me there? I don't know. Uncle gadget, this might be a trap. You know, penny, I'm thinking that this might be a trap. That's what I just said. You gotta let me come with you this time. Sorry, penny. No can do. This is work for a serious law enforcement professional. You mean like a bathroom attendant? Exactly. Now, don't stay up for me, Penny. I'm on the case. (TIRES SCREECHING) Now, I need you to keep a sharp eye out, Gadget-mobile. If you see anything suspicious, you let me know. GADGETMOBILE: You mean like a Trekkie with a girlfriend? GADGET: Exactly. CLAW: The goose has arrived... ready to be cooked. (CHUCKLING EVILLY) (BEEPING RAPIDLY) MAN: There we go. How's that? Yeah, now, I'll just... Even at this level? Wow! (MACHINE WHIRRING) Round and round. Radio: In sports, the national hockey league... Hmm... Keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious, brain. Come on. BAXTER: Inspector gadget! Hey, Baxter! What are you doing here? I'm showing off my latest gizmo, the bark translator. It's going to give a whole new meaning to the term "police dog." Watch. Speak, Pedro. (BARKING) (COW MOOING) Very impressive. Now Pedro can talk to cows. No, no, no, no. It's supposed to translate into English once I've got all the bugs out. -(ELEPHANT TRUMPETS) -(SHEEP BLEATING) (ROOSTER CROWS) MAN: (ON P.A.) Attention, the unveiling of the new Protoid laser is about to begin. I'll see you around, Baxter. Bye bye, Pedro. Good luck! Pedro. -(YODELS) -(ROARS) Well, better have myself a little look around. Go, go, gadget binoculars. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Inspector gadget! Inspector gadget! Inspector gadget! Excuse me, inspector. I'm your biggest fan. Brick: I thought I was his biggest fan. No. I'm definitely his biggest fan. No. I'm his biggest fan. Will you excuse me for one minute? (SCREAMING IN GIBBERISH) Sorry. Would you mind if we took a picture? Uh, no. No. I'm always happy to oblige my fans. Ready? Say cheese. Cheese. Cheese. Heh heh heh. Thank you, inspector. You'll never know how much that means to me. Well, it's my pleasure. And remember, crime doesn't pay. Wrong, gadget. Crime always pays. Ha ha ha ha ha. Thank you, thank you. Distinguished guests and, of course, members of the media, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to my... whoops... our science convention. The chip is in position, your Claw-fulness. Yeah! Watch as I play with my new toy, the gadget puppet. Well, guess that letter must've been a prank. Everything seems okay. Oh. Hmm. Well, I've never had glitches like that before. Mayor: And to introduce you to the eminent Nobel-prize winning scientist Dr. Theodore Von Sprokenwich. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. It's so nice to be here... In riverton. Ah... ah... ah. His new experimental Protoid laser. (WHIRRING) Think positive, no-glitch... Thoughts. All right, gadget, let's party! (LAUGHING) (SQUIRTING) (EXCLAIMING) (MUMBLING NERVOUSLY) I'm sorry! Should come out with a little soda water. Inspector gadget, what do you think you're doing? (SCREAMS) I didn't say "go, go, gadget" anything. (EXCLAIMING) Oh, no, Uncle gadget, what now? (EXCLAIMING) Whoa... whoa! What's wrong, inspector? I think I'm having a glitch attack. (CLAW CACKLING) Hyah! Sorry! Unh! Hyah! Excuse me. Whoa... Mickey. Woof! Woof! "Woof"? Let's go! Gadget-mobile, help! (SNORING) (GADGET SCREAMING) I was right! Claw's men are stealing the laser! (MACHINE POWERING DOWN) Don't let them get away. Hurry! (BRIAN BARKING) (GIGGLING NERVOUSLY) We're getting rid of it. (BRAIN BARKS) BRICK: You know what, this thing's heavy. (GROWLING ANGRILY) Hey! Aah! These are my favorite shoes! Get in the car! (CHUCKLES MANIACALLY) (GADGET SCREAMING) Gadget, I said stop it this instant! I've got everything under control. (EXCLAIMING) (MAYOR WILSON SCREAMING) Oh! GADGET: Relax, mayor Wilson! It's only toothpaste. Remember, kids, brush twice a day. (SCREAMING) (GADGET SCREAMING) (CONTINUES SCREAMING) Whoa! (GRUNTS) -Ooh. -(COUGHING) Easy. Ew. Not to worry. I'm all right. You! (GROWLING ANGRILY) Oof! He's got my shoe! Bad doggy! Let's go. (TIRES SCREECHES) (GADGETMOBILE SNORING) First ion fuel cells and now a Protoid laser? What is claw up to? Huh? What'd I miss this time? Thanks for all your help. Hey, I've been working nights, okay? I need to recharge my battery. (BRAIN BARKS) Brain? What you got there, boy? From the bad guys? (BARKS) Hey, now this might be an important clue. (BARKS) (SIREN WAILING) I hope Uncle gadget's not in too much trouble. Fired? You can't fire me. I quit! Hmm. Wait a second. I don't want to quit. Besides, chief, it's not my fault. Look what Baxter found on me... a circuit override chip. I don't care! Claw stole the laser, and you tarred and feathered the mayor in toothpaste and caused $100,000 in damages. Well. Turn in your badge, gadget. Oh, but, chief, all I ever wanted to be my entire life was a crime fighter. Your badge. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Well, that'll be all, Mr. gadget. (SIGHS DEEPLY) CLAW: Gadget's goose is cooked... more like deep-fried and burnt to a crisp. (ALL LAUGHING) (CLAW CACKLING) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Silence! Now, with gadget out of the way, it should be smooth sailing from here on. (CACKLING) (ALL LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Gadget: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm... Hmm. (MACHINE GRINDING) Uncle gadget? What are you still doing in bed? And why is your trench coat and hat in the trash can? I'm no longer a policeman, penny. (BLOWS) I'm a... well... There are a lot of things that I could be. Window washer, huh? Dog catcher... ooh, parking valet. Sky's the limit. But, Uncle gadget, you can't give up now. Here, look what we've got. It's a bowling shoe. One of claw's men dropped it at the science convention. What were you doing at the science convention? Never mind that. Look, we can solve this together. We can track down claw and get you your job back. No. I'm through. All right, then, I'll track down claw myself. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You are to stay out of this completely, do you understand? This is a grown-up problem. Uncle gadget, just give me a chance. One chance. Look, the fact is, that there's nothing that you or anyone else can do for me. I'll never be a crime fighter. Never again. You don't believe in me. (PENNY CRYING) (WHIMPERING NERVOUSLY) Go away, brain. Brain, go away. (CONTINUES CRYING) (WHINES SOFTLY) (BARKS) Okay. Okay, I get the message. It's up to us now, brain. We have to help Uncle gadget. (BRAIN BARKING) Come on, let's get to work. (MUSIC PLAYING) (SNIFFS) (BRAIN SNEEZES) (PENNY COUGHS) Go, go, gadget hammer. That's lunch, people. (LAUGHING RAPIDLY) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) -(SCISSORS SNIPPING) -(HAIR DRYING BLOWING) (SAW CUTTING) (BLOWTORCH BLASTING) All finished. Voila. (HAIR SIZZLING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) What's this? A patent number. Aha. CLAW: Faster, minions, faster. (CACKLING) (WHISTLING) G2, are you any closer to capturing claw? Yes. I'm on the case. Hmm. (MUFFLED) Oh, no. (BEEPING RAPIDLY) Keep your paws crossed, brain. This might be exactly what we're looking for. (BOWLING BALL STRIKING PINS) Look. It's the same shoe. The shoe was made by the bowl-rite company in the 1950s and 1960s. I wonder where their factory was. Let's see. 1959. Bingo. Ah, here it is. The bowl-rite bowling equipment company down on old mill road. It must've gone out of business, because it's not in any of the directories after 1960. I wonder what's there now, brain. CLAW: Now, the third item that I need... huh? (GROWLING ANGRILY) (MAN LAUGHS) As I was saying, the third item to complete my super weapon. (TAPPING) I know this one... the Ruby. Yes, but a big Ruby... say, about 50,000 karats. Heh heh heh! Your Clawsomeness, where are we going to find a rock that big? The riverton museum. The Ruby's on loan from the raja of India and will be on display Wednesday night at the mayor's fund-raiser. We are going to stop by and do a little fund-raising of our own. (CACKLING MANIACALLY) GADGET: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to mayor Wilson's fund-raiser-o-Rama. Oh. (GROANS) Oh! Gadget. Don't worry, chief. No need to tip me. We better be getting inside. Yeah. It's nice in there. MAYOR WILSON: I'm here. Good evening. Good evening, everyone. Yes, it's me. Ha! Break out the cameras. (SITAR MUSIC PLAYING) Ooh, another photo-op. (QUIMBY HUMMING) G2, notice anything suspicious about those musicians? Aside from the fact that the music doesn't match... The instruments they're playing? Mm-hmm. PENNY: Come on, brain. Yep. This is definitely the place. Well, at least the building's still here. (WOOD CLATTERS) (WIND BLOWING) (BRAIN WHIMPERS RAPIDLY) I don't know, brain. This place is creepy. (WHIMPERS SOFTLY) Welcome, sir, welcome. Lady Campbell, how wonderful you could come. Lovely to see you, sir. (SHRIEKS) Claw! -(SCREAMING) -(ALL SCREAMING) CLAW: Greetings, mayor. Hope you don't mind if we drop in on your little party. Everybody stop right where you are. The festivities have just begun, and I can promise it's going to be a gas... laughing gas, that is. (CACKLING) (LAUGHS) CLAW: That's right. Laugh it up, riverton, because I am having the last laugh now. (ALL LAUGHING INDISTINCTLY) (YELLING) (CLAW CACKING) (PEOPLE LAUGHING INDISTINCTLY) (SIGHS SOFTLY) Must be quite a party. Do something to stop him, Chief Quimby. (BOTH LAUGHING) You'll never get away with this. We'll see. (LAUGHING) G2, see. (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Very funny, Claw, but you forget... I am unaffected by laughing gas. Now stop this felonious and unlawful act, or I shall have to use force. Ah, the lady gadget. I've so looked forward to meeting you. I hope you don't fall victim... To my magnetic charm. (CLAW CACKLING) (WHIRRING) (LAUGHING, EXCLAIMS) (METAL CLANKING) (BOTH LAUGHING EXCITEDLY) (GIGGLES, SCREAMS) -(GASPS) -(G2 GRUNTING) (BRACES METAL PINGING) (YELLING) (GROANING NERVOUSLY) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) (BOTH LAUGHING) Now if you'll excuse me, G2, I have some shoplifting to do. Ha ha ha. (GLASS SHATTERING) (WHIMPERING) It looks like someone's been here... and recently, too. -(CAT YOWLS) -(PENNY SCREAMS) (BRAIN BARKING) Thanks, Brain. (GROWLS SOFTLY) Do you see that? Brain, look. It's a perfect match. (BAND LAUGHING INDISTINCTLY) GADGET: Done so soon? Uh, yeah. We were playing the unfinished symphony. Yeah. Yeah. And then we took this giant Ruby. Yeah. That was the name of our last song. You know, we took this giant Ruby. We took this giant Ruby took this giant Ruby stole this giant Ruby stole this giant Ruby stole this giant... Just a minute, there! Huh? (WHIMPERS SOFTLY) Let me get that for you. Thank you, inspector. That's it. Everybody in. Thank you. Nice to carpool, isn't it? Yeah. There. (TIRES SQUEALING RAPIDLY) No tip. They stiffed me again. I live on tips! Brain, take a look at this. "Fuel cells." That's what claw stole from the warehouse. "Laser." That's what claw took from the science convention. "Ruby." (BRAIN BARKS) Now, what would claw want with a Ruby? PENNY: "Quantum Physics for Dimwits?" Okay, claw's definitely up to something big. (BRAIN WHIMPERS SOFTLY) Wait a minute. I know what claw's up to. He's going to build... -(DOOR OPENS) -(MEN CLAMORING) Come on, brain. (MEN LAUGHING EXCITEDLY) We're rich! Hey, hey! Mckible: Hey, how much do you think... This thing would fetch on e-bay? About $1.98. No, nitwits. Once we've robbed the federal reserve, we can buy hundreds of these baubles. With my secret weapon, riverton will be defenseless... as will the rest of the world! (ALL LAUGHING INDISTINCTLY) I've got to tell Uncle gadget. Come on. (METAL CLANKS) -Huh? -(GASPS) (BALLS CLATTERING) Well, if it isn't mini-gadget. Get her! Jungle Bob: Come on, let's go! SQUINT: This way! Come on! -JUNGLE BOB: Whoa! -(SQUINT GROANS) MCKIBLE: She's getting away! I'll cut her off at the pass. -Come here. -(YELLING) (BRICK GROANS) (SCREAMING, GROANS) (MOANING SOFTLY) -(SCREAMS) -Get back here. -(BARKS) -Get her! -(YELLS) -(SCREAMS) (GASPS) (MEN SNICKER) Hey, isn't this the place to get new bowling shoes? MEN: No! Uh-uh. (BRAIN BARKS) QUIMBY: I assure you, miss mayor. We'll do everything in our power to apprehend claw. G2 will be... G2 is finished... Along with the whole gadget program. It's time we reinvested in some good old-fashioned policemen and women, not these mechanical clowns. Ms. mayor, if you just give me another chance... you had your chance. It's bad enough they stole the Ruby, but what's worse... no one gave any money to my campaign. (SOBBING) I should've learned my lesson with gadget. This whole program is a total waste of time. Come on, G2. We're taking you back to the precinct for immediate deactivation. Deactivation? That's right... deactivation. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Hmm. GADGET: I'm sorry, G2. Thank you... But there's nothing you can do. Now, G2. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Nothing I can do. Hmm. (BELL RINGS) Or is there? (LIQUID BUBBLING) Okay. Now, where's... That light switch? (GADGET SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Ohh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! (BLOWS) Wrong switch. Ahh. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (MACHINERY WHIRRING) (HISSING) (BEEPING RAPIDLY) What happened? I reactivated you. Inspector gadget, why would you do that? Well, I hate to see a good detective get recycled, and... I've always had great admiration for your investigative abilities and your physical prowess, your commanding voice. Inspector, are you saying you like me? (EXCLAIMS) Well, I suppose. In a manner of speaking. (HEARTBEATING RAPIDLY) Strictly professional. Huh? Hmm. (HEARTBEAT STOPS) (GADGET CHUCKLING) Thank you. You're welcome. (BRAIN BARKING FAINTLY) (BARKS) Brain, what are you doing here? Where's Penny? (BARKING NERVOUSLY) Ooh, he's trying to tell me something. It's too bad I don't speak dog. Hmm. If only dogs could talk like people. Mmm. That would be good... wait a second. I have an idea. (STATIC) GADGET: All right, brain. Now speak. -(STATIC) -(ROOSTER CROWS) (DOLPHIN CHIRPS) (ELEPHANT TRUMPETS) (TARZAN YELLING) -(DUCK QUACKS) -(FROG CROAKS) (CHUCKLING) (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) Bow wow. Brain... Speak something else. Check. Testing 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Penny has been kidnapped by claw. Amazing, isn't it, what modern technology can do. Wowsers! Penny's been kidnapped by claw? Yeah, and claw's built some sort of giant laser he's going to fire at riverton and rob the federal reserve. He's holding penny captive out at the old bowl-rite bowling factory on the outskirts of town. The bowling factory? Of course. The bowling shoe. Penny was right. I should've listened to her. She tried to tell me, and I didn't listen to her. BRAIN: Speaking of listening, I'm getting a little tired of liver-flavored kibble all the time. Would it kill you to shell out for a pork roast or a little prime rib? Look, G2... My niece is in trouble. I know that you don't ever work with a partner, but I really need your help. Are you sure you want my help? I can't think of a better person to go after a super-villain with. (BRAIN BARKS NERVOUSLY) All right, let's do it! Let's kick some claw tail. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (WHOOSHING) (SQUIRTING) -(WHIRRING) -(CLICKS) (BELL RINGS) Ready? Ready. Let's go. MCKIBLE: We're here, your Clawsomeness. PENNY: Claw, you'll never get away with this. Penny, my dear, prepare to witness a great historical moment. Your demise? (LAUGHING) I do enjoy your sense of humor. Now, it's almost 9:23. Mckible, activate the ray. (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) Why can't evil geniuses ever say "please"? He's a very busy man. I'm a busy man, too. (TONE BUZZING) (ALL EXCLAIM) CLAW: Behold! The greatest super weapon of the 21st century. A bowling pin? CLAW: No, you dim-witted pea-brain. Watch and see. (SNICKERING) (WHIRRING) Whoa. Double whoa. Meet the time displacement laser... my crowning achievement in a lifetime of evil. Riverton doesn't stand a chance. Hurry, Gadget-mobile, before they fire the giant laser. Can't you make this jalopy go any faster? Jalopy? Oh, yeah? Well, bring on the noise and bring on the funk, because I'm bringing out what's in my trunk. (BOOMING LOUDLY) (FLESH FLAPPING) (BRAIN WHIMPERS LOUDLY) And just wait until I get into second gear. CLAW: Time for riverton to take a true snooze. (CLAW CACKLES) (CRASHING LOUDLY) Fire away!

REPORTER: Over here, mayor Wilson. Whoo ooh! It's gaining on us. Faster, faster. (BIRD CHIRPING) GADGET: Wowsers! That was close. Riverton is in a deep freeze, your Claw-city. That means time has stopped. That's what I said. CLAW: Good. Now we won't have any trouble... With traffic. (CACKLING) BRICK: I don't care. Uncle gadget. (TIRES SQUEALING) The ray looks like it's stopped. You think it's safe to go back? Oh, there's no time to waste. We got to stop claw and rescue penny. Then to the federal reserve... and step on it. It's time to kick some bad guy Booty. (TIRES SQUEALING RAPIDLY) CLAW: We're just here to pick up a few hundred billion in bullion. Hope you don't mind. I don't think he minds... A bit. -(BRICK LAUGHS) -(THUDS) (BEEPS) Time to show me the money. (BOTH LAUGHING) (MOTOR WHIRRING) (WHIRRING STOPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) It'll take weeks to crack this thing. Not if you know the right people. Thank you, Mr. bank director. Your services are no longer required. (THUDS) (DOOR UNLOCKING) (ALL LAUGHING EXCITEDLY) MCKIBLE: We're rich... rich! CLAW: Okay, underlings, looks like the federal reserve is having a 100% off sale! (CLAW LAUGHING MANIACALLY) GADGETMOBILE: Out of my way. G team coming through. I'm going to need a really big piggy bank for all of this. Come on, brick. Faster, faster. CLAW: Now, let's see. Tomorrow, we rob fort Knox. Then on Tuesday, the Louvre. So much to steal, so little time. Wait. I've got all the time in the world. (MEN LAUGHS INDISTINCTLY) (TIRES SQUEALING) GADGETMOBILE: The cavalry has arrived. Huh? Gadget again. Uncle gadget, you're all right! -(BRAIN BARKS) -(YOWLS ANGRILY) -(SCREAMS) -Come here, you. -(GROANS) -Come on. GADGET: The jig is up, claw. You're under arrest for kidnapping, bank robbery, breaking out of prison, and general, all-around evil. The jig is most certainly not up. In fact, the jig is just starting. Oh! You want me to play dentist with your niece? PENNY: Uncle gadget, help! Brick! Mckible! PENNY: Help! -Get in there, you. -(PENNY SCREAMS) Dr. claw, what about us? Yeah, man. You're minions, aren't you? Get the good guys! PENNY: Uncle gadget, help! Help! Help me! I'll take care of these clowns. You go after claw. Good call, g2. Go, go, gadget helicopter hat. Stupid glitches. I hate being last year's model. Here. Let me give you something from this year's model. Take one of my chips. G2, but... Then you might get the glitches. I'll manage.

Penny: He must've put in his own security code. Well, then we'll just destroy it. Whoa. No! Then everyone will be frozen forever. We just have to think like claw. What kind of a code would a super-villain put in? -(SNAPS FINGERS) -I got it. And I just lost it. (BARKS) Hey, wait a minute. I know. Let's try "crime always pays." (DINGS) Not always, claw. (WHOOSHING) Hmm. BOY: Oh, yeah! (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING EXCITEDLY) And for heroically foiling Dr. claw and saving riverton, I would like to award inspectors gadget and g2 these distinguished conduct medals for their service to this city. Yay! Congratulations, gadget. And I'd like to announce that we are going to double the gadget unit's budget for next year, so that if claw ever tries to show his face in riverton again, we'll be ready for him. Excuse me, chief. If I could just possibly... Even just for a second. Hmm. The real secret to our success has always been teamwork, but there's one member of our team who hasn't been acknowledged yet. And so... For providing key support to members of the gadget team, I would like to award this junior inspector medal to penny for her meritorious conduct. -(ALL CHEERING) -(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) I couldn't have done it without you, penny. You are one special kid, and I'm proud to have you as a partner. Thanks, Uncle gadget. (BRAIN BARKING) Yes, brain. You're special, too. (BARKING) GADGETMOBILE: Hello? Anybody remember the internal combustion member of the team? What am I, scrap metal? I helped, too. Where's my citation? Hey, what are you doing, man? Oh, not that kind of citation. Good night, gadget. See you Monday. Good night, Baxter. Night, Baxter. Bye. -Come on, brain. -(BRAIN BARKS) G2: Inspector. I just wanted to say I may have been a bit premature in my early evaluation of your abilities. Well, that's very big of you, g2. I was wrong to think of you as inept, clumsy, imbecilic... Don't mention it. Obsolete, simple-minded, malfunctioning... yes, yes. I get the picture. Anyway, I look forward to more teamwork in the future. Hmm. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (HEARTBEATING) (BEEPING RAPIDLY) Oh. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (WHIZZING) (FIREWORKS POPPING) (PENNY GIGGLES) I just love happy endings.
