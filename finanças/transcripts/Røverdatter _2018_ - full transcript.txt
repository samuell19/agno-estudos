-Want to try to carry it? -OK. -I can do it. -You sure? -Give it to me. -That's the wrong side. The viewfinder is over here. Good job. You looking good? Yeah. OK, let's get ready. -Hi, is this Siv? -Yes. Hi, this is Sofia, Kjell Magne's daughter. Have you seen dad? No, I haven't seen him for a couple of years. A couple of years? I'll just have to check those places I can think of, I guess. I'm sure he'll show up somewhere. 19 MONTHS LATER I'm picking up dad, who's been in jail for 19 months. He's being released without a single damn possession. Sofia in traffic. I'm done! 19 months is a long time. I've never been inside that long. You'll keep getting longer sentences every time. That's life. What do you know? You're only 26. When I was young, dad and I would shoot bows and arrows. We also played computer games and tag. And Hide the Beer Bottle, Flirt With the Bartender, - - and Run From the Taxi Bill. And these games escalated - - until mom and I had to run for our lives. Things didn't go well for dad, the man mom feels I'm so similar to. And I have felt a need to help him. And find out if he still can become a father to me. MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY Are you on anything right now? -No. -No? -Nothing. -How does that feel? Good? Sure. I guess. What would it take for you to be satisfied with your existence? To have a normal life. Like I had before. If that was good enough, you never would have started using. Sure, but ... -Things happened along the way. -Like what? Hm? You can't expect me to have all the answers right now. -I'm just curious. -Relax. What's the rush? Lay back down. It hurts. I don't give a shit. It's a nice image. "I don't give a shit." Christ! We got you a job. Now for an apartment. Sign here. No! Don't start smoking right away in your brand-new apartment. Let's hear a shout of joy. I have a bed. -That's all you have. -That's all I have. So I can leave that off the list. Can you help me with my bed? Sure. -Promise? -Isn't that what dads do? Excellent. Victory. Peace. Ever since I started school. -What? -There were ... Conflicts. "Do this, do that," and I would do something else. OK. So what happened? I don't know. They called in the Educational and Psychological Counseling Service. They made me take an IQ test. I was in seventh grade. -Were you dumb, or what? -That's what they thought. I'm glad I was diagnosed with ADHD. That explained a lot. That proved I wasn't dumb. That wasn't the problem. Right? What can I say? At least that's an explanation. The first time I met dad as an adult, - - was when I drove him to his mother's funeral. I hadn't seen him since I was ten, so I was clueless. He gets in the car and hands me a bag. "Belated happy birthday," he says. The bag contained a car stereo. Clearly yanked out of someone else's car. Probably just before. I was like: "OK ... Thanks." "I already have a stereo." "Sure, but this one is better." At the same time it was very ... It was kind of funny. And I think things like that can be fun. I believe life - - consists of many stories. The point is to collect as many stories as possible throughout life. I think dad is like that, too. Dad? Here's the deal. Dad? I can't be around you all the time. I know that. So you have to film yourself. Can you do that? -Sure. -You can have this camera. Is it on autofocus? No. You'll have to learn how it works. My back! It sucks that I have to - - self-medicate myself. So I have lost. Either way. Hell if I know! You think I'm scared of killing? I deserve a Grammy for that one. What I really want, - - if I'm working ... Then I, like everyone else, - - want sick pay, dammit! Why can't I get that? This is the second time you have turned me down. And I am fucking ...! That's all for now. Hey, baby. Happy birthday. -27 years old. -Ready to go? Yes, let's go. I hadn't planned a big celebration. I had made ... I had invited some friends. Yes. We'll do that. Bye. Is he using again? Mhm. You shouldn't have to deal with this on your birthday. He's coming out now. He just had to go up to his room - - to get a dog. That he's giving to me. That I have to find a new home for. -Hi there. -Hi. Hi there! You call this a Labrador? -Don't give me that bullshit. -What can I say? Why do you have to go where no one can find you? So I can choose who to hang out with, and no one brings the cops. Why would anyone bring the cops? Tommy tried to trick me out of some morphine tablets he was selling. "Give me my money now!" You know? That's what happens. And then he claimed he didn't have any money. "Strip down, and go get my money. Don't come back until you have it." -That's where I live. -I'm aware of that. I probably know that better than you. Good dog. They had a sweater in here I wanted to buy for Sofia. But it wasn't for sale. The fact that you go around hiding is very suspicious. Understand? Don't look so sour. I'm an old man. I'm 54. It's amazing I can even walk. You're old, but you act like a 15-year-old. That's how I feel. 87,000 kroner? What's this? -We'll deal with these later. -I don't have 87,000, so that's ... -Who do you owe that much? -Yeah, who? It's extremely annoying to deal with people on drugs. I'm not on anything right now. -I can tell. -I'm tired, not on drugs. I can see it in your eyes. I refuse to pay your rent and take care of you, if you're on drugs. But I'm not. Why can't you take care of the dog here? I have things to do. Business as usual. Business. Fuck business! You have a regular job. Sure, but I need a little extra on the side. -You sure aren't using it to ... -I love you, Sofia. You're using it for drugs, not to pay the rent. -I had to pay a drug debt. -A drug debt? Don't yell at me anymore. I'm only human. I'm only a boy. A little boy. I'm only 54. It sucks that he's started using again. But that hasn't stopped me before. The time he gave me that car stereo and wished me happy birthday ... That was our first meeting, and we jumped right in, in a sense. Then and there, we developed a certain dynamic. After that we weren't total strangers. We were strangers, but we had a certain dynamic. Like that we both had a certain gallows humor. It wasn't a normal relationship, but it was a relationship, What's going on? We had an agreement. -And here you are distributing pills. -No, soda. We have bills to bring to the welfare office. If you have lost your keys, you have a huge problem. If you're unable to open your beer, you shouldn't be drinking. I'm a firm believer in that. That's the wrong way. Have you been at a hotel and stolen towels? And a Louis Vuitton bag? A hotel pillow ... Yech! What? Why do you have dirt in here? Because you filled it with flowers? What is this? A menu? Seriously. Why? Why? Why? He has a lot of crap, but not what's most important. OK. -Where can we go to find a key? -Come with me. It's here. No, one more floor. Hi! He's looking for his keys. -I have them here. -You have them? Are you ready to go? Just let me catch my breath. Where's my dog? Is that your dog? I have her. Thank you so much. What's the dog's name? -Ada. -Ada? When is Ada coming home? Do you want her back? -Do I want her back? -Yes. -Of course. -We're not resettling her? Are you crazy? Who said that? -I heard you mention it once. -Never! We eventually ... We finally got his keys back. Excuse me! Look! This iron is still on. That's dangerous! You've already caused a fire once. -Hi. Have you been out playing? -Ouch! The entire wall is hot. I'm in trouble because I left the iron on. My daughter's in here. Can you hear her yelling? She's yelling at me like crazy. You're about to say something negative. Let's hear it. Let me give you some shampoo first. See if that helps. I'm just wondering what's going on. Shampoo helps. Things have just been rough. I've been sick and ... You could end up spending a year behind bars, - - for stealing that hotel stuff. You think people don't go to jail for that, but you will. -You want me to quit? -Quit stealing? Yes. What am I supposed to do, then? Grow vegetables? Pick apples? -Not steal towels! -Maybe I can start begging. I can go sit down on the corner with those Albanians. "Money for bread! Money for bread!" It's hard to talk to you. There's no way I'm ever doing that. -Forget it. I refuse to beg. -Why do you have to beg? Because I have to ... I can't have a life ... My life can't be based on other people helping me. Thanks for your visit and your help. -Bye. -Bye. I love you. Bye, Sofia. I have spent some time with dad now. I thought things were going to work out. But they haven't. We can't communicate, because he's high all the time. And that isn't nice. So I'm going to live my own life now. Do something completely different. Something easier. That would be nice. But at the same time I'm at a crossroads. That says a lot about me. I don't want to be the type who gives up. Yet I can't take responsibility for him. He has to be clean, in order for us to have a relationship. That is some heavy shit. Pull the trigger, dammit. Go ahead, pull the trigger! The door is open. I think they've changed the lock. Hello? Dad? Jesus Christ! I hear his cell phone. The subscriber cannot be reached ... I don't like this. I can't exactly call the police and have them open the door. Hi, do you live here? -Do you know Trude? -Yes. Is she in 501? Yes, I think she lives there. Hello? Trude? Trude? Hi. Is dad here? It's three o'clock. -What did you say? -Stop filming. What? We have an appointment. I'm glad you made it up here. Yes, it is quite a long drive. True. Anyway, there is something we have to talk about. I have heard rumors - - that your girlfriend, Trude, also wants to apply for a spot here. -I suppose she has, then. -Yes, she has. Because ... Unfortunately I have some bad news for you. We do not accept couples for treatment here. -Oh, no. -I'm sorry about that. It does make sense, I guess. It makes no difference to me, - - as long as I can stay clean for three months and start on my meds. Because that is your goal? To be clean for three months? Yes, get treatment and start my life. I'm 55 years old. So it's about time. -Is that camera distracting? -No, it's no problem. I need to ask you some questions - - that we ask everyone at these interviews. One of them is if you have any ... Do you have a history of violence? I was charged with assault once. A long time ago. Were you ... Were you on drugs when that happened? Can you remember? Yes, I remember. I wasn't exactly high. I wasn't high, but ... But the circumstances were very special. You say it was a long time ago. How long? 2004. Actually, 2003. It happened in 2003, I went to jail in 2004. And when ... Can you tell me what happened? What kind of episode was it? Listen ... Is it OK for you to talk about it? Well ... No, I can't do it. Move. Shaggy? Shaggy, you have to back up. The door won't open. I can't open the door! Hello! Hi. And there's the cameraman. Good day. Please come in. You are most welcome. What's the matter? I thought that was the telephone, but it wasn't. I meant to turn this on. I didn't know that was on. -What's the problem? -I'll be straight by Monday. You couldn't even make it to the doctor's. -That's no big deal. -How can you say that? I've apologized for oversleeping that day. You know what, dad? Look at me. Dad, look at me. Aren't we a little beyond apologies? I don't know what else to say. I'm sorry for not waking up that morning. You know what that means to me? Not a damn thing! The only thing that means anything, is that you do something. I am doing something! I'm checking an online doctor. -Can you have one fucking ... -Damn, it fell out again. Hello, my darling. -What? -What? What do you hope to achieve? Three months of clean urine, so I can get my meds. Then do what it takes to get clean. Help! Hang me! What do you think, Trude? You really need it. Starting Monday the 22nd, I am going to be at rehab in Fetsund. Cheers! Why aren't you drinking? Want some? There's something strange about a grown man - - drinking alcopop and telling his daughter: "No, I don't want to go to rehab! I don't want to go to detox!" Why don't you want to get it over and done with? I'm sorry. You can say she's a heroin addict, so it's easier for you. But you look much sicker. This is a means to an end. A couple of days. I'll make you a deal. Tomorrow is Thursday. I won't take anything, starting ... Starting tomorrow, I won't take anything. But what about today? I already have today, so that won't work. -You could start right now. -Sure, I could do that. Excellent. That's a good deal. Give me a hug. You're a good girl. You're the best daughter a man can have. For sure. Yes, I am. I'm very proud of you. And I love you. We have a deal now. I have it on tape. I'll come pick you up. No problem. This is peanuts. I'll just get a little grumpy. So you can expect a beating. I'm kidding! -Nice jacket. -Thanks. It's from mom. How is she? Fine. -Good. -Excellent. So ... I'll see you soon. Yeah. Yes. As well as you know your father, do you think he can do it? The thing is ... Well ... As well as I know dad ... Or, I think ... It's hard to say. He's such a wild card. Last time, he was clean. In a sense. For a while. But I no longer believe in his excuse for not staying clean. So you don't think he can do it? Sure, I do, but ... My faith goes up and down as he goes up and down. Kind of. I don't have any great expectations. Since I didn't really trust him in the beginning. I only knew him as a kid, when he never lived up to my expectations. My expectations of a father. So I didn't really have any expectations regarding him. And I still don't have any expectations. And because of that ... It's ... It's OK. But as soon as things start going well, as soon as you start thinking: "Shit, it's working! This is going to work out." Then you get expectations. And that's what's dangerous. That's when you start thinking: "Shit, now I'm vulnerable." We're taking dad to the doctor for a urine test, - - so he can prove he's clean. Then he can spend the next year in rehab. And we'll be free from all this craziness. For a year. -Hello. -Hi! Do you have cash for a couple of beers? I'll pay you back. I don't have any money. Ask someone else. -Need help? -No! How complicated is it possible to make something? OK. How do you feel about wires? -I hate wires. -Me too. This should be wireless. -One more time. -I hate wires. -I hate wires. Strange. -Strange. Is it on? -Yes. Weird. -Have you changed the battery? It's totally dead. -What's that beeping sound? -This. Your battery's dead. I have a spare over here. Come on, princess! This is rough. -What is rough? -When you don't have amphetamine. -It's hard. -Hard? -I'm just kidding. -You get tired? -No, but ... -But what? I get uneasy. Let's get that battery. I'll wait here. You go take your urine test. You have to do that now. Can you film it? Seriously? OK. You can place it on that counter. Super. Bye. -What's up? -What's up? -Did you do it? -Yes. I need an ATM to see if some money has come in. You can borrow 70 kroner from me. Let's drive up to the store. Put it in "P" before you start. Good thing I'm here to look after you. That was a good shot. And now ... Heineken! Get yourself some new pants. I got tipsy from that shot. If I had some amphetamine now, that wouldn't have happened. Without amphetamine, I'll turn into an alcoholic. The only way I can calm down, - - is by drinking. You have a substance problem. You have to drink or do drugs. No, my problem is that I have ADHD. I feel uneasy in my soul. I can't relax. I can't calm down without ... Because if I don't have amphetamine, - - I can't sleep more than two hours. Then I'm up banging on doors. And then I go back to bed. Like when I lived with your mother, I would drink, drink, drink. That's how things were before. I mean, I understand that she gave that up. It isn't easy to live with someone who has ADHD. Is that what you're looking for? Yes. -Why do you need speed now? -To get high. I'm starting detox tomorrow. I need something to get detoxed from. -That's weird. -What's weird? -I missed. -You missed? Is that dangerous? Are you stressed because we're here? Do you want us to leave? Ow! I can't watch this. -How can you do that? -Don't ask. Don't ask. OK, I'll come and drive you to rehab tomorrow. OK? I love you. Hi! Is dad here? -He's going to rehab. -I was expecting him two hours ago. I told him he at least had to call and postpone the appointment. Do you know if he's packed? Are you packing for him? OK. That's great. Hi, my name is Sofia Haugan. My father, Kjell Magne Haugan, - - has an appointment with you to start detox treatment today. The gate closes at 1 pm? 1 pm? Let's start packing. She postponed it. I'm working on it. -Before 3 pm today or tomorrow? -Before 3 pm today. You go find him. I'll pack. OK, thanks. See you later. OK! Everything depends on him being home now. If he isn't, he's fucked. Hey! -You're supposed to go to rehab. -Today? You know it's today. I was at Trude's. Come on. I'll drive you to Trude and then we'll get you to rehab. What are we doing here? -I said we're going to rehab. -Rehab? OK, I'll see you at Trude's. Are you afraid? Are you afraid it won't work out? No, it might be best if it all went a little bit to hell. Then it could only get better. That's how the world works, isn't it? Are you OK? Hi. Seriously, he's in his underwear? You have to leave. He's in his underwear, jumping rope. Kjell Magne ... Dad? Practice makes perfect. I want to bring this. Trude, catch. No! This will be my entire spring. Sitting there, feeling miserable. But it doesn't have to miserable. Are you doing so much better now? -At least I have possibilities now. -Possibilities? I have a great life with Trude. What else do I need? But Trude ... But Trude? What should I do with Trude? You think it's fun for me to leave her? Come on. Stick this in your pants. Incoming! Come on. We have to be there before 3 pm. They'll lock the gate. We have to leave now. I'll just run away. Why do I have to get locked up again? I could easily do this on my own. Then do it! You proved that you're incapable. I've been straight for the last nine months. -I can do this myself. -You mean nine days . -But still I have to go. -You have tried this before. You could have proven this ages ago, with urine samples. I could have done lots of things. Could have shot myself. Then you never would have been born. Why do you keep saying that? Because I feel, if I had a job now ... Why don't you have a job? Because I have given up. After getting punched in the face as many times as I have, - - by those fucking assholes ... I look around before I dare get back on my feet, - - and bang! I get knocked down again. Again and again and again! Eventually you get skeptical about standing up. What the hell is this? This is about you needing to act. I'm aware that I need to act. -Then do it! -That is the worst part. So I have no reason, because this isn't about me at all? You have no blame at all? -And you have nothing to blame? -Sure, I ... Listen to me! I have ten girlfriends with ADHD. And none have ended up as fucking junkies! Yet! They probably get more help today. They don't. They don't get any help at all. -They'll have problems eventually. -You are so lucky. Your girlfriend has packed for you. She's trying to get you to do what's best for you, not for her. Your daughter drives you around to all these fucking meetings. Gets you a job, an apartment, everything. You are in a very special situation. You get so much more help than anyone else. No one gets as much help as you do. But you feel sorry for yourself because you "don't get any help." Because you have taken so many blows and so much shit. -That's bullshit. -Is that bullshit? Is it? Is that bullshit? Do you really want to do this now? Want to talk about my childhood? -Back when you were already ... -Already what? You were already an alcoholic. I was an alcoholic at 14! That's when I started drinking. To try to find peace. And then I tried other things. And of course that's affected everyone else. Sure, I have my issues. But what happened back then has nothing to do with me. That has to do with my empathy. I tried to stop it. I didn't deserve what happened back then. I'm done with that. If you're done with that, I think ... I'll never be done with it. I dream about it every fucking night! I don't owe you anything. I do a hell of a lot more for you than you deserve. I do everything. Absolutely everything. As I told your mother: I'd go through fire and water for you. -You kidnapped me when I was four. -I didn't kidnap you! Fine, let's just leave. You can take care of yourself. Bye! Someone once said it must be scary to have a dad like that. But I never get scared. If someone acts menacing toward me, I go into battle mode. I couldn't have a relationship with dad, if I was afraid. Angry people get more angry if you are afraid. In reality we feel guilty. We get sad. But we can't access those emotions. They make us vulnerable. And that is not safe. Fuck! I have taken so much shit. Shit! Calm down, Kjell Magne. Damn ... Hi! What's the matter? What's it like for you, when he's like that? -I don't like it. -You don't like it. You wanna play? You wanna play, little girl? Let go, now. Come on, let go. Just make sure you don't bite my fingers. It's just this part. And the lock case. There's no lock case. Right, but ... OK, see you later. I'll just polish this a little. -OK. Bye. -Bye. I have set certain goals, like that I'm going to get dad clean. But I don't think that's possible. Is the hard part that I fail to achieve my goals? Or that our relationship - - won't be as good as it possibly could be? Anyway, achieving my goal - - and succeeding at this, getting him clean ... I don't think that's possible. But I just get ... The harder it gets, the more stubborn I get. And this film is no exception. We have to talk about why we're making this film. -Why we're making it? -Yeah. I agreed to this so I could get to know you better. -Now ask me. -Why are you making this film? I don't know ... Maybe because I had the need for a film like this when I was younger? When I was different from everyone else? Because ... Because I was - - different. Why? Because ... I don't know. Don't just walk away! You ... No, come back here. Sit down. Hang on. I just need a couple of puffs. We're going to do this now. Why did you put your hood on? That's cheating. You can't do that. Why not? Because ... Aren't we doing this so we can get to know each other better? How can we do that, without talking about things - - that are painful? Yeah. Good point. But ... Why were you different? -Because of me? -Yeah. At least that's what I felt. Yeah. OK. -That's too bad. -Is it wrong to be different? No, being different is good. But I wish I had been there. And I wasn't. And ... There's nothing I can do about that. You know? So I like to say: Look at you! You turned out fine. You turned out fine. You're doing well. So all is good. Want me to get some tissue? I had a lot on my mind, but you were all that mattered to me. And you were taken from me. What do you think about that? Bygones. I try not to think about that. Try to look forward. I just try to be happy here and now. ADA, TRUDE AND KJELL MAGNE LIVE HERE -Hi! Have you moved? -No. You won't go to rehab without Trude, Trude won't go without Ada. So let's find a place that will take all three. -No one will take a dog. -Sure they will. Open the goddamn door. I'm Kjell Magne. I have an appointment. You shouldn't smoke. I'm not giving you a light. Have you talked to the Welfare Organization? No. I'm using the same drugs as always. Amphetamine. And most other stuff. But now I'm going to rehab. Did you get annoyed in there? I got furious. Holy shit! You probably aren't going to get in, because you aren't clean! That was the whole point! All he had to do - - was send that fucking referral. I thought he had sent it. He said he had. I feel like ... I feel like punching him right in the face. You have to get a new doctor. You can't keep using him. Sofia is a hothead! Stop it. -Rehab hotline. -Hi, this is Sofia Haugan. I was wondering, my father has applied for rehab ... -That is not correct. -When did you get it? November 11. Today. -Today? -Yes. She said she'd help us, but shit! Unbelievable. All they do is lie. They lied straight to your face. They just got the application today. What are you doing? Are you snoozing? All I can get is bad shit. Then suddenly I get something good, and boing! And then ... Then I can't sleep. What's this shit? I was just going to shoot up, and it's no good! Hi, this is Sofia Haugan calling. Kjell Magne Haugan's daughter. You got the application for his girlfriend. No other place treats couples. Open your eyes, come on! Open them! Open your eyes! Are you all right? I'm worried they might lose their place in line. Dad, Trude, come here! They have accepted both of you and the dog. At a farm. Now you're happy! High five! You did it. Hooray! -We did it. -We did it. OK. Want me to tell you what's going to happen? Dad got into rehab. Yay. But first of all, today, - - he's getting evicted. What the hell should we bring from here? This is how it goes when you don't pay your bills. -They can't take all this. -But I can't take it either. I can't bring things like that mirror or the chandelier or anything. -Don't shine that in my face. -Sorry. OK? So much for the apartment I worked so hard to get him. When he first got out and had nowhere to stay. They said this was his last chance to get a place to live. His first apartment got flooded. The second one burned down. And this one ... Was neglected. Or ... OK, it's off to rehab tomorrow. Careful, I have glass in here. -See you. -Tomorrow morning. At the crack of dawn. So no drugs, OK? No drugs. OK? Promise? Hello? Just ... Don't do anything stupid. Take care of each other. Is this where it's going down? Hi there. I got your text message. I can't let you take heroin. I at least want to be here, if you do. I wonder if I brought that hash. Uh-oh. Hello. Are you out taking pictures? I'm out filming, yes. Not pictures. I'm filming. -Filming what? -You, right now. Be quiet! How is your ...? -My what? -Your willy. -My willy? -Still have a hole in it? -What? -My dog bit your willie. Was that you? When I stole that Mercedes? -I didn't bite you. -I know. So that was you? Holy shit. I have never stood so still in my life. So that was you. Man, did I "freeze." -Does it still hurt? -No. That sure was impressive of your dog. -She's a good dog. -You can say that again. -So you've stopped stealing cars? -Me? I'm a carpenter. I don't do that stuff. -Not anymore. -I see. Unless I really need a car. If my daughter needed me to come help her right away, - - I would steal a car immediately. -So would I. -Right? To help her. Or to help Trude. But to steal a car just to mess with you, I wouldn't do that. -Have a good night, Mr. Haugan. -You too. Nice talking to you. Take good care of your dog. Bye. Holy shit, the camera is on! I got that on film! The camera is running. I think I got that on tape! Sofia is going to love it when she sees this! -That was fun. -It sure was. Stop that, for God's sake. Don't film this. One last time. I'll just film myself. I'm not allowed to film until Trude has cleaned the counter. You're a horse's cock, that's what you are. A horse's cock! "Everything for art," as Sofia says. A little spin ... -A warm-up? -A warm-up. Does it hurt? No, I'm fine. -Did it work? -What? -Did it work? -No. We'll see. Not yet. -Was it close? -Huh? Was it close? Yeah, I had it, but then ... Let's see ... There! Life is wonderful! Did you get it in yet? Look at this. No, it's all a mess. -Give me a break! -That's just blood. I know. Was that bad shit again? I don't think so. -That was my last time. -Huh? That's the last time I do that. Sorry, Sofia, but I needed a fix. And now - - I feel perfectly calm. Look at my hands. Steady as a rock. Everything is in balance. Just wait till I get some dextroamphetamine. Then everything will be fine. Stop! This is not for children! No, you can't bring that much. You can get it later. What is Geir doing there? Just come out now. Yes, Ada is here with me. Yes. Bye. They have not stayed straight, that's for sure. Hi. Do you think we can all fit? She has to be back here. Have you locked the door? There's hardly any room. Can't you get that when you come back on leave? OK, but it will be tight. You can put it by your feet. Get in. No cigarettes. It's totally obvious that you're ... -Don't give me that. Look at you! -Am I high? -Yes! -Are you sure? -I'm positive. -Your eyes are black. You're one to talk! It's no use. They're getting blacker and blacker. I'm just having fun. -Sure, fun at my expense. -At your expense? -I regret this already. -What? What? We have to be there by 2 pm. And they're just going to send us back. I hope the weather ... They won't send us back. I hope the weather is nice. If you guys can't even make it through one night ... -Can't even what? -You can't stay straight. I don't see how this can work. That was just because we were going to rehab. It's over now. Sure, but ... That's all. We haven't done anything illegal. You can't say you haven't done anything illegal. -Sure, but ... -It isn't legal. We're going there because we're drug abusers. -True. -Yes. But no one will be able to tell - - that we ... stayed up all night. It's nothing. Don't worry about it. -Should we ring the doorbell? -She's coming out now. Hi! -Welcome! -Thank you. -Kjell Magne. -My name is Cecilie. -Hi! -Hello. They say the dog isn't allowed to stay here. -Is everything OK? -I talked to the director. We can't have animals at this unit. Can you bring it back? No, that isn't possible. The only alternative is to leave the dog at the farm. But they won't be staying there. That's the place they applied to. Do you have people who can bring the dog to this other place? We can handle that, but how will they feel about it? They'll have to make their way home themselves, if that's a problem. I am not bringing them back. And that's final. I'm sorry. We were surprised too. That was the only reason they wanted to come here. I think we'll just - - unload the car as fast as possible. And then we'll leave. So that they stay here. That's our strategy now. There. I just wanted to say bye, and take your recording equipment. Bye. Bye. Bye, Ada. See you soon. It's crazy that we get there, - - and they say, "No, the dog can't stay here." No, I don't think you should come back to Oslo. Let me call the Welfare Organization and we'll figure this out. Hi, Gudny, this is Sofia Haugan. Kjell Magne's daughter. They applied there because that place allowed dogs. But when we get there, it turns out they aren't staying at the farm. They are assigned to a different place. No, but after I started helping him, he has ... How often did he used to get arrested every year? A lot. So it clearly helps to get help. To have hope. I worry about you. That you don't get to live your own life. Are you still there? No, I'm not alone. -You have someone with you? -Yes. I have my boyfriend. That's good. It's important you live your own lives ... Sure, but if you can help me take care of this ... Because this was supposed to be ... We have worked so hard. -Yes. -I'm aware of that. I'll give them a call and we'll see what we can work out. Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thank you. Talk to you later. Bye. She's going to take care of it. You need a hug. You saw that? There. Everything will work out. We finally made it to the farm. Right? Excellent. Now we're happy. Good. Now pick her up. I can't do that. She weighs ... I'll eat my ice cream while I film you eating yours. -He's drooling on me. -No, Shaggy! That's one way to do it. Good idea. But all we see is your stomach. On Monday you get your meds. Then you won't have any more excuses. -What? -Do you like butter? Let's see if you like butter. Yup, you sure do. What do you mean? How does that work? If you get a yellow reflection under your chin, you like butter. Doesn't everyone get a yellow reflection? -Stop it! -So everyone likes butter. Everyone likes butter, don't they? You're just buttering me up. Subtitles: Nick Norris
