Hi. It’s me. I'm coming back. I changed the booking. No. Nothing. [Spanish music, male vocals, text about life and death, with guitar and rhythmic clapping] UNSAID And your awful boyfriend didn't even pick you up! Yes, you monster! Take this thing off. Oh God, that's heavy. Now tell me what happened. I wanted to see you. I missed you. [crashing waves, a woman shouts gleefully in the waves and laughs] Where have you been? At university, like every Wednesday. Have you made progress? Why do you always ask me that? Am I not working hard enough? No, of course not. I'm interested, that's all. Would you like to read something to me? No. [honking, street sounds of a southern city, laughter of a woman] [acoustic music, chaotic, oriental, zither] Sarah? [sounds are coming from the shower] [music is coming from the street, solemn male choir] Marie! There you are, finally! Where were you? You wanted to pick me up! Sorry, I was all sweaty after the flight and needed a shower. And then the hotel... It must be super expensive. The first night should be spent in style. Has your dad bumped up your budget? My dad? He doesn‘t even know I’m here. So, what’s next? Any plans? Sarah, I've tried to call you. I must’ve been in the shower. That was over half an hour ago! Marie, come on, loosen up, we’re on holiday! Yes, but in summer there are water shortages on La Palma. Every drop of water is precious. - Really? - Yeah, really! Depending on water pressure a shower uses up 6 to 18 litres a minute. What shall I do now? Promise to better yourself. Marie, full of wisdom and mercy, I promise to better myself. I have a new one. Shit, that’s not real, is it? May I? You' re mad! Hi Ben. I can’t sleep. Please don’t be angry with me anymore. Shit, this sand is hot. Bye, bye! Sarah wait! How does it work? No idea! Pull it down! That burns! Can you see the natives’ caves over there? They say that hippies live there. People in the shop were talking about it. What hippies? Those. They’re no hippies. What do I know? What, up there? Crazy! They probably don’t have electricity, water or a toilet. Why would you voluntarily return to the stone age? Frustration about the world? That's escapism. Not everybody is born to be a fighter. I’m not a fighter. You are strong, determined. You don’t give up easily. When you sink your teeth into something, you don’t let go. You're a real bull terrier. Thank you very much. What a great compliment. Hi Ben! I’m sitting on the beautiful beach of Tazacorte, or something like that. Please call me. Now you look like a cute little piglet. Another such comparison. Piglet, bull terrier. Make up your mind. I don't think Ben is treating you well enough. I don't want to talk to you about Ben. Why not? Because I don't like him? You don't really know him. He was my lecturer too. - Yes, but that’s very different. - I don’t think so. I think you really can make judgements about your teacher. And excuse me, but Your Ben doesn’t care if nobody gets what he’s talking about. That’s just how it is at university. And excuse me, “My Ben”? He thinks he’s so great up there lecturing. - Well, it’s no longer your concern. - Exactly. But you’re my concern. He’s patronising you. Well, you’re not a good example. What do you mean? Since I’ve known you, you’ve had how many boyfriends? 6? 7? And none more than five weeks. What’s that got to do with you and Ben? I think you’re really afraid of commitment. You always leave before real life begins. Typical. I can’t say anything without being analysed. Yes, free and home-delivered. You’re always so damn sure about everything. What side would you like? I don't care. Have your pick. You should wear the green one. It brings out your eyes. Isn't that too revealing? You should take off the bra, of course. And go without? Why not? Your breasts are beautiful. And a little potbelly. Which is completely invisible. Anyway, skeletons are out of fashion. Since when? Have I missed something? At least put on the black one. Ben should give you more compliments. Maybe he does. Yeah, sure. - Don’t start again. - I’m not saying anything. What about you? I'll go as I am, or do you find me embarrassing I'll just dry my hair. I'll order us two paellas. Mine with chicken. It’s nice that you’re here with me. Sometimes, when you’re very close to someone, you don’t see them properly anymore. Then the familiar turns into a mystery. How philosophical. Isn't that the guy from the beach? Maybe you should join him. Or I’ll introduce you two... No, Sarah! May I sit down? Yes, sure. Why not. I’m Javier, and you? Excuse me. I don´t speak Spanish. - Doesn’t matter. Do you speak English...? - Sure, but... This is a misunderstanding. That’s a shame. - Your friend told me you’re interested...? - Did she? Well, you have to understand, she’s a little crazy. Cavemen. What? No, she didn’t say that. Yes, cavemen. The thing is. I don’t live in a cave. That’s good for you, I guess. Or is it? What’s your name? Tell me your name. Waiter! Please! Would you mind...to give that to the waiter, please? You can have the paella. Both paellas, actually. Maybe, you’re hungry. Or you have a friend who’s hungry. I’m so sorry. See you around. What was that all about? I'm interested in cavemen? What? I think you should have a little adventure. He’s cute. Ugh, vodka! Oh yeah, he’s sexy. Well, if you don't want him, I'll take him. - Or do you think I don’t stand a chance? - Sarah, you’re drunk! So obvious? I'm not frigid. I'm not frigid! Sarah, that’s not a good idea. You said he’s sexy and I’m sexy too! But for now you’re pretty loaded. I'm loaded and sexy! Come now, I'll take you back to the apartment. Hi sexy man, I'll be back! Sarah! Sarah! No! Come on, out now! Your own fault, you could be nibbling on a cute little Spaniard. Stand still. I’ll get the wet clothes off you. Now, t-shirt. No! Nooo! It's all wet now! Oh, God. I love you! I love you too. - We don’t mean the same thing. - Why? What do you mean? I mean, I really do. Real or unreal... I don’t get it. Maybe, like a man? Darling, you’re drunk. That’s all? That’s all you have to say? What else do you want me to say? Maybe, that you love me too. Sarah, honestly, you’ve drunk half a bottle of vodka. How can I take you seriously? I’ve had these feelings for longer. Since when? Maybe six months? Maybe from the very beginning. How can you be so sure? Jeez, Marie, because I’m not 13 anymore with a crush on the spotty boy next door. But now what do you want from me? What do you want me to do? I don't know. Anything. Is this why you went on holiday with me? You hoped that something would happen between us? Why is that so inconceivable? I can't stay here with you any longer. You don’t mean that, do you? You want me to take you seriously, right? Please! Please! [acoustic music with string instruments] Pull over, please! Oh God, I am so out of it. I think it’s left now. I’ve had enough. We wanted to take a stroll, not a mountain hike! And I don't fancy frying in the sun all day. I'm turning back. Why don't you? [long-drawn-out sound creating suspense] What are you doing? Are you crazy? You could die! Let go! I said take your hands off! You’ve been avoiding me all day, refusing to look at me. Why can’t you accept that I can’t do this and that I don’t want to! I'm not doing anything! - Don’t pretend nothing happened! - What did happen? I'm not a fool! [woman sings about love, jealousy, unsaid words, unexpressed feelings] Ben! You just need to call. I'll return in one piece, I promise. Yes, all is well. Ben, please. No! I’m honestly thinking about it but... it was so difficult to find my flat, why can’t you move in with me? - Your flat’s way too small. - And anyway... Sarah lives just around the corner. One more reason. She’s my friend. And I don't understand why. Let's not fight about this, please. So, you're moving in with me? - Okay. - That’s what I wanted to hear. I love you. Is this how you imagined it would be? No. You're stiff like a board. How did you realise? That you make me randy? If you want to call it that. For a long time, it was just that feeling... of missing something important when you weren’t there. Like I was less alive without you. I imagined telling you everything... that’s going on with me... and what you would say. I often feel the same. That’s normal. It was when we were dancing at the Club 74. A song was playing that you love and you stormed on the dance floor. You were so uninhibited. Your body was vibrating and... I couldn't stop looking at you. I felt hot... and wet. That was it? Then we walked along the Havel... You told me you were keen to go to the Brazilian jungle to become an intern for that environmental group. Oh my God! I don’t know how many times I’ve talked about this! You don't even remember? I simply don’t understand how it’s different for you. What are you missing? Sex? Yes. Sarah, please. I don’t want to have to hurt you. Maybe I just want to melt into somebody... to forget about myself. Simply to arrive somewhere... and have that feeling of belonging. I always told you everything. It was you who held back. I'm scared! What of? I’m scared of forgetting what you look like... what you sound like... your laughter. How it is to touch you... your hair... your hands. You can't lose me. You know, that's not true. That smells delicious. You went for a swim? Yes, in the morning the sand is nice and cool. Where do all these goodies come from? I can do magic. Could you bring out the coffees? Con Pavo. Whatever that means. With turkey. Sometimes you get on my nerves. Hey, this was my half! Yummy. Really? Would you like to try? - Good, isn’t it? - Yes! - Ugh, that’s disgusting! - Sorry. Did you know that nearly 10% of la Palma’s population... are German immigrants? Really? Let’s leave everything behind. Let’s get out of Germany. You don’t really consider emigrating, do you? There has to be more to life, something that makes more sense! We’re rushing around like idiots. I feel like a stupid hamster running on a wheel, because there really is no point. But what choice do we have? That’s exactly the point! Are we autonomous beings or puppets!? And who pulls the strings? God? God has given us free will... or we would still be in paradise. So sweet! [joyful music, Spanish, e-guitar] Have you changed your mind? [in the background Spanish folk brass music] [sounds of exploding fireworks] Well then, if that's what you want! Sarah! Where is Sarah? Where is Sarah? Hi. How are you? Come here. This morning is too beautiful to waste. Time is precious. Don´t. Why you are so tight? Oh my god! I could give you a thousand reasons if I wanted to talk to you about it, but I don´t. Do I get a coffee? No! No need to be so unfriendly. There is the door. Get out! You´re a stupid girl. Sarah? Have you seen a girl, my age, blonde curly hair? No girls here. Sarah? Sarah! Who is it? God you frightened me. Shit, I was damn worried! May I? You're all wet. Get your clothes off. Can you hear the music? I can’t bear this. You don't have to. It's okay. That was nice. I have to tell Ben. He'll keel over and die. That will do the rounds. Soon everyone will know. But I don't care! Really! What is it? This wasn't it. What do you mean? This just wasn't it. Sarah, I don't understand what you're trying to tell me. We’re not together or anything. Did I do something wrong? It’s not always to do with you. What else could it be? That's what you wanted, isn't it? Yes, and you gave it to me, because I wanted it. I know, that I love you. You staged everything! Stay in the tent. I’ll sleep outside. Save your damn pity! Please, don't be like this. I want to sleep. So, please. But I love you. Don't touch me or you won't know what hit you! I’m leaving. I have to go out again. - I thought you wanted to cook. - I forgot my Portuguese lesson. Why do you even live here? You’re never home. I’ll be back at eight. I have to go. It looks like a pigsty in here! I wasn’t sure earlier. Sure about what, if you wanted to talk to me? You look good. You look like crap, actually. There you go. How long have you been back? A few weeks. What went wrong? Javier was an idiot, but no surprise there. Listen to yourself. How do I sound? So done with it. You’re still angry. At least you’re here. I thought you never wanted to see me again. Where do you live? I thought... maybe I could stay with you. With me? Sarah, that's not a good idea. Ben won't like that. Please! Just a few days. Put your things in the corner. I brought Sarah along. I can see that. I suppose you bumped into each other on the street? - She’ll stay with us a few nights. - I see. It’s freezing outside. We can’t let her sleep on the street. Uh, our dropout is now homeless? She won’t be trouble, will you, Sarah? It’s not my intention. Make sure she’s gone during the day. I need to concentrate. Thanks. The deadline for his doctoral thesis is next month, but he is behind. I understand. I’m missing the sun, don’t you? Do you like it? Yes. Maybe you can tell me now what happened on La Palma. Nothing happened on La Palma. I already told you. And, Sarah, do you agree? Apparently nothing Marie wants to share with you. I was just wondering. I bet. Stop this! Both of you! You’re so naive, Marie! - I’ll put the towels in front of the door. - The door is open. You should lock it. Don’t think I don’t know what you’re up to... You're not good enough for her. You won’t succeed. Does that mean you've forgiven your girlfriend her little infidelity? There is still some foam. What about your internship in Brazil. Have you applied? And? Did you get an answer? I can start next month. Next month already! Yeah, but it's not good timing. You don't want to go? - Why? Are you pregnant? - Of course not. But you haven't cancelled, have you? What's that? Javier threw a pot with hot oil at me. Asshole. Sod that! What will you do now? What will become of you? I don't know. So, nothing has changed. Except that I won’t be emigrating to La Palma anymore. I was so dumb. I hate myself for how I hurt you. I can't forgive myself. You were right... I was scared. And I am still scared. Shit, I missed you so much! Ben. That’s exactly what I imagined. Sarah, I want you to leave. Pack your stuff and bugger off. What do you think happened? You must take me for an idiot. You think you’re so superior to us men. Do you think I can’t put it together? I don't see you packing! I don't want Sarah to leave. I don’t care what you want. This is still my flat! Sarah is my friend, and I pay rent, so stop treating me like your chattel. So that’s how it is. - You want to fuck around behind my back? - What? How does she pleasure you? - What are you on about? - I’m sure she’s great with her tongue. That’s complete rubbish. You and your fucking lies! Ben! Marie. Marie, are you okay? I don't know. Let’s get out of here. Come on, get dressed! Marie! Wait! - What’s this lesbian doing to you? - Don’t let him work on you. Marie. Please ... Let's go. Come on. Let go! I said, take your hands off! Marie! Absolute madness! Crazy! He totally lost it! It's freezing. Your hair is wet. Don’t you have a hat? I do have a hat... a hat on my head! Hat! Hat! Aren't you cold? Come on, we'll look for somewhere warmer. That’s a church. How do you know your way around here? I used to come here to Mass with my mother. After her death, I came on my own... for a few years. It's not exactly warm here, is it? Get your coat off and lie down. What? Nothing. I'm just so confused. Alone in a church in the middle of the night, that’s just crass! Are you scared? No. We shouldn’t waste this night by sleeping. [slow piano music, melancholic, sombre, moody] You’re not crying again, are you? No. Liar. You’re the best friend I ever had and ever will have. Sarah? Sarah? [a woman sings about the search for a place in life] [two women laugh]
