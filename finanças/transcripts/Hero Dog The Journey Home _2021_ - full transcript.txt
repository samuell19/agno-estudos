So I'll lead you down to the boat. Great. Sorry to be such a pain. Normally, I can find my way around pretty well, but here, I feel like I might just take a swim. Don't worry about it. It's no problem. - All set? - All set. That's a boy, that's a boy. That's a boy, all right. Okay, your captain today is Fred Boggs. He's old, but he knows these waters like the back of his hand. There we are, you stay there now. You stay there, that's a boy. - Ahoy, Captain Boggs! - Oh, there you are. And you must be my passenger, Mr. Davis. Indeed it is. Royce will be fine, though. Is that Chinook I hear? Oh, is that your dog? No, no, he's my sister's dog. Isn't that right, Chinook? Well, I heard he just flew in from Africa. Yep, this dog has had some pretty incredible adventures. I've heard all about it from my niece and nephew. Well, I just wish he could talk, I could deal with this tales all the way on the trip up. Let me take your bag. - Okay. - Okay. Just come a little forward. I got the bag, all right. Now, watch your step. Now, what I'm gonna do is I want you to take your left hand here and put it on this stanchion. Okay, now I got us. You got the step? Over... yeah, that's it, man. - Careful. - Good. You got one step, hold on. Yeah, you're good. One more step down. - Oh! - There you go. - There we are. - Hey! Welcome aboard. Thank you. Oh. Sorry, sometimes this can get a little awkward. I'm afraid I'm not gonna be much of a deckhand around here. You're gonna do just fine. - Now let me get you a seat here. - Okay. And all you have to do is turn around because you're in the stern seat, okay? Got it. All right. - Okay. - And there's Chinook next to you there. - Now, sit, you're fine. - Hey, boy. There you go. - Hey, hi, good to see you. - Here is your life jacket. Just put that around your arm there. - Okay, got it. Got it. - You got it? Okay, that's fine. - How ya doing, boy? - Now, if he's gonna be any bother, I can put 'im up forward. Oh, no, no, no, Chinook and I are old friends. Aren't we, boy? All right, okay. All right. - Hey, Aunt Susan. - Hi, sweetheart. What time are we picking Dad up at? I think his boat gets in around 5:30. I can't wait to see him again, he's been gone so long. I know. Your dad hates being away from you and your brother, you know? And since the mine closed down, he's gotta go where the work is. I'll let "His Highness" know. No annoying your brother. Hey! Hey! Open this door or I'll break it down! I'd like to see you try! What is going on up there? Erin came in and threw water on my back! Erin, what did I say? What, it's only water! it's just a joke! All right, we'll talk about this later. Max, go back to your own room! I'll get you later! Everything okay back there? Need anything? No, everything's fine. Just enjoying the ride. I guess you experience things in a completely different way. You could say that. The scenery sounds beautiful. The sun feels beautiful on my face. Never thought about it like that. When one... one sense stops functioning, the other ones tend to compensate to an amazing degree. You mind if I ask ya, were you born with blindness? No. No, it was a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. I was 19 at the time. - Oh, you were in the military. - Yes, sir. Army Engineers. We were assigned to build schools over there. They sure had a heck of a way of saying thank you. I... I don't carry around bad feelings anymore. I mean, it was a war zone and I did volunteer. - Are you married? - I was. My wife died two years ago from cancer. I have a boy and a girl. One tween and a teen. I'm sorry about your wife. It's been tough on all of us, my sister's been a godsend. Taking care of my kids while I had to be away for work. Yeah, you gotta rely on family in times like these. Well, I'm... I'm not in my 13-year-old son's good books these days. Uh-oh, why is that? We had to move to the city for my work since the mine closed, and he's an outdoorsman, hates the city. He's like my boys, they love the north. - My wife and I raised six. - Six! Wow, you don't see too many families with that many kids these days. No. No, you don't. Well, things were different back in those days. They're all grown up and doing their own thing. One thing, as long as you have your kids, stay close to them while you can. Oh, I intend to. That's why I can't wait to get back. I've been away far too long. All right, off to pick up your dad. Yay, I can't wait to see Dad again! I hope he brought my new video game from the city. That's all you care about, those stupid video games. They're not stupid. You haven't got a clue, lame-o. All right, you two, absolutely no fighting when we see your dad. Nice, happy family. Nice, happy family, that's right. What is it, boy? Captain Boggs, is everything okay? Captain Boggs? Captain Boggs! Captain Boggs! He still has a pulse. I gotta get to the controls. Just call your dad real quick and see how far out he is. Hm, that's weird. He should be close enough by now. Chinook? Hey, buddy. Hey, Chinook. Hey, boy, go get Captain Boggs. Captain Boggs! Help! Hey. Captain Boggs? Hey. Hey, buddy. Captain Boggs? Captain Boggs? Okay, he's still got a pulse. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hey, pal. Call home. Oh, come on. Got no signal. Call home! No signal. Hi, David, this is Susan Wade, Royce's sister. Yeah, I'm just wondering if you can confirm for me that Royce left the office and is on his way, uh, on his way back home. He did. Okay. No, I'm a little bit worried. I'm here at the dock in Port Moody and he hasn't shown up yet. I think he was supposed to be here about an hour ago. I'd appreciate that, David. Yeah, thank you. Call me back as soon as you can. Okay, thanks. Where's Dad? Shouldn't he be here by now? They're gonna find out the name of the boat captain bringing him up here and get right back to us, okay? We'll just wait here for a little bit. Okay, okay. Okay. It won't be long before we're declared past due, okay? Someone will come find us. We'll be fine. I found my stick, buddy! What's that, boy? I got water. I got water, pal! Chinook, buddy, come here. Come here, you thirsty, bud? Come on. That's a good boy. Drink up. Good boy. Yeah. That's it, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I just hope help gets here soon. Unless we're in a cove or something. I think it's gonna get cold. I mean... I'm gonna have to look for some blankets. I'm guessing by the feel of your coat, you're not gonna need one, huh, bud? I know there are some here, right? Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, this'll work. Oh, hey. Yep. I bet you'd like a piece of this, huh, bud? There you go. No, I gotta save it. What else have you got in here? Here you go, here you go. What's this? Okay, well, that might come in handy, provided I can load it and fire it up in the air. Okay, got it. Maybe I can signal a plane or something. Right? - Hi, are you Susan? - Yeah. All right, no word from your brother? Nothing, no. Every time I call, it just goes straight to voicemail. Okay. Well, we've let search and rescue know, they're trying to reach the boat by radio. Best thing I'd recommend is for you and your children to go home and wait for word from us. You should know my brother's blind. He won't be able to last in a survival situation the way a sighted person would. Okay, good to know. I'll let them know right away. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, thank you. I've just been informed that Mr. Davis... Ah! What about Daddy? Where is he? They're gonna find the boat and they're gonna let us know, sweetheart. We'll go home for now, okay? He's still alive, Chinook. But I don't know if he's gonna last the night. I'm guessing with this weather, they've called off the aerial search, buddy. I don't know, buddy. I don't know. We gotta keep up our strength, pal. Here. Call home. Call home. Mayday! Mayday! Does anyone copy? Mayday! Mayday! Do you read me? Mayday! - Come in, come in. - Mrs. Wade. Captain Walker, it's good to see you again. Thanks. Please. I wish this reunion was for very different reasons. Do you have any information about my brother or the boat? I'm afraid not, Mrs. Wade. We were not able to get the boat on the radio and we're not able to launch the choppers in this weather. Now, the skies will begin to clear at 0600, and then we plan to launch the choppers and search the entire route that they should've taken. What do you think happened? I mean, they can't just vanish. I really can't say. I mean, Captain Boggs is an experienced captain. He knows these waters very well. If they ran into trouble, he would have sent out a distress call from the boat, and so far, we haven't heard a distress call from anyone along the coast. Is it possible they hit a rock and went down? Yeah, that is a possibility, yes. So my brother's either drowned or floating around out there in the middle of the night? Now, let's not jump to conclusions. We are going to launch a full-scale search first thing in the morning. Look, he's blind. He can't survive out there! We're doing everything we can to rescue your brother and Captain Boggs as quickly as we can. My base camp is five minutes down the road. You and I can be in constant contact. Thank you. Hey, boy. Hey. Good boy. Good boy. You're a good boy. It's okay, he's still with us. It's okay. We're gonna be fine. Have they phoned about Dad yet? Not yet, sweetheart. What if they never find him? - Aunt Susan... - Hey, hey. That's okay. That's okay, they're gonna find him. They've got the helicopters up looking for him right now. - Shh. - They should've called by now. Well, it's gonna take a little time. What if Dad is dead? Hey... Don't you even think that, okay? Come here, come here. Shh, shh. He's gonna be okay. Captain Walker? Captain Walker. The first of the boat units headed out 30 minutes ago. Okay, great. We're gonna have to search every nook and cranny of those inlets, right? - That boat could be anywhere. - Yes, sir. Of course, if it struck a rock and went down, we're gonna need a submarine to find it. Not just a helicopter or a boat. That water's over 400 feet deep in some spots. Exactly. I fear we could be doing a recovery operation, not just a rescue, James. I heard the passenger on the boat is blind? That's correct. If this isn't hard enough, we have that to deal with that as well. His poor family must be going through a terrible time. And he has two kids. Captain Boggs' wife is beside herself as well. Well, if that boat is still on the surface, we'll find it. Hey, buddy. Hey, there you are. We gotta give Captain Boggs a fighting chance. Okay? He may only have a few hours left. You're gonna be my seeing-eye dog, okay? All right, we're gonna be a team. Okay, we're gonna do this. Come on. Come, Chinook. Okay, we can do this, buddy. Here we go. Come on, buddy, come on. Come on, boy, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. You can do it. Come on! Come on. You got it, buddy. Come on, come on. Good boy, good boy. We gotta help Captain Boggs. Go! Come on, buddy, come on. Come on. That's it. Come on, we're gonna get help. Come on in, Mrs. Wade. - Anything? - Not a trace. What am I gonna tell the kids? That the search is far from over. Every boater in the area has been alerted to be on the lookout. He'll turn up, eventually. Provided they haven't sunk. This is like something out of the Bermuda Triangle. I'm as baffled as you are. You see, if they went down, you would think that one of our boats or helicopters would've seen some floating debris. And no radio contact, no phone contact? How could they just vanish? See, the boat's emergency beacon was never activated, and I don't know why. If they went down, the beacon would activate on contact with water. And if they ran aground, well... Captain Boggs could've activated it manually. - And nothing. - Nothing. Okay, go home, boy. Let's go home. Let's go, okay. Good job, buddy. You'd be better at this than me, even if I could see. Hey, okay, okay. Good job, boy, good job. Okay. Just a little bit, okay? Buddy, we gotta ration this. You know, I've never even been camping before? My son, on the other hand, is obsessed with the woods. I think he must... be some descendant of Davy Crockett or something. Okay, now I know why I've never been camping before. Hang on, hang on. Good boy. Good boy, come here, come here. Come, come. Okay. Hang on. Hang on. Oh... Yeah, we don't wanna forget our bag. It's got our treats, all right? Okay, go home, go home. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, okay. Whoa, boy. No, no, come here. Come here, Chinook. I don't know how deep this is, buddy. Or how warm. What are we gonna do? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where'd you go, buddy? Chinook? Chinook! Hey, buddy. Hey, Chinook. Hey, boy, hey. Mrs. Wade, I came as soon as I could. This morning, a local fisherman found the boat. - It went aground. - Oh! Thank goodness. - And my brother? - He wasn't there. Wasn't there? What do you mean, he wasn't there? - Did he fall overboard? - Here's what we know so far. Captain Boggs suffered a heart attack while they were heading up to Port Moody. Now, he was found with the boat, in critical but stable condition. Your brother left a note, saying he was going to get help with the dog. - So my dad's alive? - It appears he is, yes. That's right. Chinook was being brought back up here to us. With everything going on, I completely forgot about Chinook. Here's what we think. Your brother decided to hike out using the dog as a guide. So he's lost out there in the woods? Can you show me exactly where the boat was found? Sure. Yeah. Right about here. That's a whole lot of wilderness out there, son. So now what? What do we do? My teams have begun a full-scale search of the area. Unfortunately, we don't know which direction they could be heading. But at least now we know what happened. And my teams have a general area in which to begin the search. My brother won't last out there in the wilderness. - It'd be hard for a sighted person. - I know, Mrs. Wade, I know. We're gonna need a fire, buddy. I'm not even allowed to start the barbecue at home. Gotta find some sticks, okay, buddy? Come on. Here. It's okay. Yes. Come here, boy. Come here. Hey, come here. We're gonna start this, okay? Come here, boy, move out of the way. We searched the entire first sector in all directions radiating out from the boat site. - Nothing? - Not a trace. He can't be moving that fast. What if he's already landed at the bottom of a ravine? Well, let's hope that dog has sense enough to keep him away from ravines. - Is it a seeing-eye dog? - No, just a family dog. But he's a big Alaskan Malamute. What do you think his chances are? Not good. Are they gonna call tonight? Captain Walker said he's gonna call around seven with updates. They should've found Dad by now. I'm sure they're doing their best, Max. They have helicopters and search dogs! And they're not gonna stop until they find him. - They aren't doing enough! - Max. Max! Not bad for a blind guy, right? Hey, bud. Erin, wake up. - Leave me alone! - Erin, wake up! What? What's happening? What time is it? - I'm gonna find Dad. - You're going to do what? I'm gonna find Dad. No one knows these woods better than I do. That's crazy! Aunt Susan will never let you go! That's why I didn't ask her. I left her a note. - Now, are you coming or not? - It's too dangerous. I don't think you should. I already lost Mom. I'm not losing Dad as well. Now, do you love Dad or not? Of course I do, I just... - I don't know. - Fine, suit yourself. But I'm gonna find him. Max, wait! Max, wait! I can't let you take all the credit. I can survive out there just as well as you can. Okay, fine, but I'm the expedition leader. What? You never mentioned that. Every expedition has a leader. Well, this expedition as two leaders. Come on. Max! Erin! Max! Okay. Easy, boy, easy. What is it, boy? What is it? What is it, Chinook? I don't know what... What is it, boy? I don't know what to do. Just coming towards you, okay, buddy? I'm just gonna take another step, buddy. Okay, I think I get it, buddy. Oh... You okay? You okay? You're a good boy. Okay? You're a good boy, you're a good boy. Thank you. That was the police. I was just making sure they had a full description of the kids and the pics you sent me. I can't believe they would do this. First my brother and now the kids? Mrs. Wade, we need to stay calm here. Do you have any idea which way they could be headed? Max has that map, I'm sure they're probably headed to where they found the boat. Your nephew can navigate in the woods that well? Yes, I think so. Um, he's always been really good at orienteering. Well, he's probably thinking he can cross paths with your brother that way. It's a good thing, in the sense that now we have a good idea of where they're gonna be heading. Come here. So this is your house, and this is where they found the boat, all right? Now, at a walking speed of approximately two miles an hour over rough terrain, we have a pretty good idea of where they could be. I gotta get out there and look for them. Mrs. Wade, I already have three members of your family lost in the wilderness, I do not need a fourth. No, you'll stay with me. They can't have got that far. We'll find them. Hey, wait a second. How do you know what direction to go? I'm using my compass. Okay, and what direction are we going using the compass? Plotted a course to where Dad's boat was found. Northwest. Okay, we're just gonna bump - into Dad at some point? - Yeah. Max, Dad could be headed in literally any direction, and no one has any clue where he is! He's coming home. I know he's heading for home. Well, I hope this Chinook is some sort of wonder dog, then. We've both heard stories about Chinook. I believe in him. Even if no one else does. Over there, boy. Hey. What is it boy, huh? Where is it? Where is he, boy? Hey, buddy. Good job. Good job. I've identified an insertion point where we can begin searching for the kids on foot. I agree, Captain Walker, that's an excellent plan. We're hoping to cut your kids off before they get any deeper into the wilderness. What about my brother? Well, our policy is to make minors the priority. Quite frankly, the kids are now drawing resources away from the search for your brother. But we can't just give up on him. Oh, no, no, we're not, Mrs. Wade. All the teams are gonna keep searching. What are you doing?! If Dad's anywhere close, he'll hear that. And what, he'll just answer back with his own air horn? Next time you do that, warn me first, okay? You almost blew out my eardrums! Oh, dear! I'm sorry, princess. Would a princess be out here in the middle of a forest with her annoying brother? No, so don't start that with me, okay? I'm getting really hungry and I hope you brought a lot of good food! We'll be hiking for another hour or so and then we'll set up camp. Do you have any idea where we are on the map? - Sure, I have an approximate idea. - Approximate idea? You mean we're lost already? When we set up camp, I can review the map. Don't worry. I worry, I worry... Why didn't I just stay home? There, perfect. - Are you sure that thing won't blow over? - Quite sure. I can't believe I'm gonna share a tent with my brother. You can always sleep outside. Why don't you sleep outside under the stars, survival man? - What do we have to eat? - Bologna sandwiches. Ew, are you serious? That's it? What'd you expect to eat on a rescue mission? Five star cuisine? No, but I thought you would have at least brought better food than that. Nope, you travel light and you eat simple foods. Bon appetit! Ha-ha. I wonder what Dad's doing right now. He's okay, he can take care of himself. At home, at the office, sure, Dad's amazing with all of that. But out here? He's okay, Erin. He's okay. Still mad that he's making us move, though. Max, Dad only moved us up here so he could work at the mine. - I hate the city. - I know you do, Max. I'm gonna set up the sleeping bags. Hey, I think there's something in here. Stop! Stop! Come here! Stop! Ah! Get it away from me! Ah! - It's not funny. - Oh, yeah, it's funny! I've never seen anything so hilarious in all my life! I could've been sprayed! Well, survival man, you just had your first encounter with the local wildlife. Is there a merit badge for that? - Shut up! - You know, haven't they ever told you? Always zip up the tent when you're not in it, or an uninvited houseguest might just walk right in. You can sleep out here tonight. All right, why don't you two take the north ridge, sweep down? Why don't you come in from the east and you link up with him on the west? Mrs. Wade, you and I will take the south ridge. - Any news from the aerial units? - Afraid not yet. How could they have just vanished like this? Look, your brother and the kids could be anywhere by now. The most important thing for us is to maintain an organized search pattern. Let's go. Max! Erin! Max! All right. Hold this and throw it to me when I get across. - All right. - Okay? All right. Okay, throw it! You've gotta be kidding me! I'm sorry! It was too big, it slipped! That was all of our stuff! Now what are we gonna do? We can try and get it! It's gone! It's gone! Our rescue mission's done! Jump over! Come on, jump over! I can't believe you did that! I'm sorry, it was too heavy! Why don't we just go back now? We tried our best. Because I don't think I could get us back! Well, don't you still have your map and compass? Yes, here in my coat, and my hatchet. That's it! We have no matches, no tent, and no food! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Max! It's okay. It was an accident. Sorry I yelled. It was really my fault. I should've gotten across a different way. Okay. Well, what do we do now? I'm not sure. Let's try and find the boat Dad was on. We know where it is, and we know there's gonna be food there. That could be another day or two, if we can find it. Well, we don't have much choice now, do we? Come on. I don't know if I can keep going, boy. I'm exhausted. Wait. You hear that, boy? Hey! Hey, I'm down here! Hey! Hello! Hey! I'm down here! Hello! Hey! Oh! - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm a little banged up, but I'm not seriously injured. No, you're cut really bad. Yeah, let's hope that wolf had his rabies shots, huh? We gotta get you to a hospital. Here, here. I wanna thank you for what you did there. That was some quick thinking. Base, I've been attacked by a wolf on the south ridge. I'm okay, Mrs. Wade is okay. No life-threatening injuries. Say again, Captain Walker. Did you say a wolf? Affirmative, I said a wolf. Over. Roger that, Captain Walker. Medical team is being dispatched to you. Evac on standby. Over. No, no, no. Don't take any resources away from the search. We can walk back just fine. Are you sure? We'll be back at base in an hour. Over. Well, I've been thinking about upgrading anyway. I've had this one for a month, right? That's the money piece. Next time a helicopter comes by, we're gonna signal it. Do you know where we are? Well, this is the Bow River right here, but it has so many tributaries, I have no idea which one this is. Oh, great! Well, at least we have plenty of fresh water. That's key in any survival situation. What about food? Well, the bears downstream are enjoying our bologna right now. Are you just gonna keep going on about that? Did you see that? Fish! Yeah, okay, cool, but we don't have any fishing gear. We will soon enough. All right, let's give this a try. All right. Oh, see that? I got one! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I can't believe it! That was amazing! Can you start a fire? I've never done it without matches before. Well, you can rub two sticks together, right? I've read how to do it, but I've never actually done it. - Okay, what do we need? - Two very dry, straight sticks. All right. Smoke! Quick, small sticks! Captain Walker, I can't tell you how sorry I am for what happened today. There is no way this is your fault. If you hadn't been there, things could've been a lot worse. It's my kids that ran off. I can't help but feel responsible. I do not want you feeling responsible in any way. Taking risks is part of my job. Royce has been out there for a long time now. If he has food and water, he can survive for a long time. Well, what happens if they encounter a wolf, like we did today? In 30 years of doing this job, I have never seen a wolf behave like that. Normally, they avoid contact with humans. - Normally. - Normally, yes. Well, with habitat loss and climate change, we're seeing human-animal conflict on a much greater scale. They're coming into areas for food that they usually avoid. Mm, not bad! Bologna sandwiches would have been a lot less work. - Here we go again. - Sorry. Aunt Susan must be losing her mind by now. We shouldn't have run off like this. I know. I was just so desperate to help Dad. Me too. Well, you got your wish, Max. - What's that? - You're in a real survival situation. Well, so far, so good. Ooh! Hey. Hey, boy. I'm hungry too. Hey. You want a little bit? Come. Show me where to go, buddy, let's go. Ah, so many bugs! - Here, here's some pine. - What? Pine needles. Rub them on your hands and rub it on your skin. I just wanna get out of here. Any idea how much further? Like I said, it's gonna take a while. I'm so hungry. Last night's fish wasn't enough to hold me. I'm hungry too, Erin. Come on. Keep going, buddy. Keep going. Ah! Come on, you gotta be kidding me! Hey, boy. Hey. I know, boy, I know. Hang on. Ah! Ah! Wow, amazing. Yeah, but now what? We can't get down. Dang it. We're gonna have to go back for a while and try another way. That map isn't much use. I just can't get my bearings, even with the map! I'm sorry, Max, I know you're trying. Yeah, yeah. Please. Please see me. He's going away. He's going away. It's okay, boy, it's okay. There'll be another one. Captain Walker, one of the teams found this washed up on the bank of the Bow river. Oh, no! Mrs. Wade, is this your nephew's backpack? Yes. That doesn't mean they're dead. They could've lost it crossing the river. It means they're out there without supplies and without food! Hang on, is the map and compass in there? No, I can't find it. Well, that means your nephew still has a way of navigating. James, show me on the map exactly where the backpack was found. - Right here, sir. - That doesn't give us a lot to go on. They could've crossed anywhere and then headed north. What I wouldn't give for just one piece of good news. I'm sorry. Hey, wait up. You okay? Hiking through the woods with no food or water is hard work. - Who knew? - Can you keep going? I just need to rest for a while. What are we gonna do tonight? - I could build a lean-to. - What about water? There's gotta be a stream around here someplace. All right? Oh, well... Okay. Hey, buddy. I can't keep you here anymore, buddy. Okay. Okay? You gotta go home now. Go. Go on, go! Go on, boy! Mrs. Wade, is there anything I can do? It's okay. Just talking to my mom. I'm sorry. We're doing all we can. I know. I know your team are out there risking their lives to save my brother and the kids. You know, it may seem hopeless right now. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye to anyone. You know, I've been involved in so many of these operations that... that end on a positive outcome. - You okay? - Tired. Max, it's a wolf! It's not a wolf, it's a dog. - Hello. - Hey, where'd you come from, boy? Max, this is Chinook! The famous Chinook! We meet at last. - Dad must be close! - Come on! Come on! Wait up! Hey, wait up! I wish we had a leash. Chinook? Chinook! What are you doing back, boy? Hey, hey, what are you doing back? Hey, where are you? - There he is! - Dad! - Max? - Daddy! - Erin! - Dad! Hey! Hey, guys. Hey, what are you two doing out here? We came to find you, Dad! Chinook led us right to you! - Where's your Aunt Susan? - Well, Max had an idea to come out here and find you. So I came along with him. What? You guys came out by yourselves? We had to, Dad. We had to. Your Aunt Susan's gonna be a wreck when she finds out all three of us are out here. - We found you, Dad. - I know you did, buddy. - Uh, Dad, do you have any water? - What? What? Yeah, I mean, I have some, but here. This is it, kiddo. We gotta make it last. You guys... you came out here without water or food? I mean, do you have supplies? Yeah, we had a bit of an accident and lost all of our gear. Turns out I'm saving you guys, huh? Wait, I could still start a fire, Dad, and I have my map and compass. Hey, Max, do you think you can guide us out of here? - Yeah, Dad, I can do it. - Okay, good. Okay, but I'm not going anywhere right now. My... My leg is wedged in here and it won't budge. Erin, come on. - No, hey, okay. - This log is too heavy! I can't move it! Look, uh... Hey, Max! Do you know what a lever and a fulcrum is? Yeah, Dad, I can cut down a tree. Okay, yeah, yeah, and use a rock as a fulcrum. All right! Erin, help me! Just stay close, guys. How's it coming, Max? That's it. I can feel it, guys. I can feel it. Okay, try now, Dad. That's it, that's it! You two are amazing. I thought I was gonna die out here. Never, ever say that, Dad. Never. - Luckily, Chinook was with you. - He saved you, Dad. Yeah, he sure did. Hey, did you guys happen to hear anything about the boat captain who was driving me? They said he was found alive, Dad. He's in the hospital. Really? That's amazing news. I can feel the temperature starting to drop, guys. It's gonna get dark soon. Hey, Max, you think you can get that fire going? - Yeah, Dad, easy. - Really? I mean, I had to use a flare gun. Captain Walker. Sorry. I've been waiting. Please, no, it's all right. Please. Sit down. Just so desperate for any sign of them. If I'd been paying better attention, Max and Erin would have never gone off without me knowing. Hey, there's no point in blaming yourself. These are good kids. They believed they were doing the right thing. Look, why don't... why don't you go home and get some rest? We'll see you first thing in the morning. I wanna... I wanna stay in one of the trailers here. I wanna be available the second any news comes in. Yeah, of course. James here will make sure you're comfortable. Thank you. - What do you think? - I think we need a miracle. Or, at the very least, a lucky break. We'll get one, sir. Hey, guys, you know what? I think it's dinner time. - One piece of jerky each. - That's it? We have to ration it, Erin. - What about Chinook? - Yeah, of course he gets one. Here you go, buddy. Yeah. We're having a campout, Dad. Yeah. Yeah, I guess we are. Max, listen to me. Nobody was happier to hear your voices today than I was. But now you two are in danger here too. Your Aunt Susan... She'll be worried sick about us. Yeah, exactly. But we saved you, Dad. You sure did. But next time I go missing in the woods, can you just leave it to the professionals, please? Sure. - Hey, Dad, you know what? - What? Max set up the tent, and when he wasn't looking, a skunk walked right inside. And then he went in and he started screaming. It was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I wish I had been there for that part. The rest, I could skip. You never liked the wilderness, Dad. Come on, Max, we've been through this. - My job... - I'll hate the city. You can go there without me then! Max. Max, come back here! It's okay, Dad, he can't go far. He'll come back when he calms down. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. - Did you sleep well? - No, not a wink. Sorry. This morning the teams will have new search areas. They'll be converging from north to south. Look, we're running out of time. We have to find them. - Did you eat yet? - No. No, I can't. You have to keep your strength up at a time like this. It's very important. Now, go get some breakfast. That's an order, Mrs. Wade. Maybe a little. - Where's Max? - Just over there by a tree. - Can you please take me to him? - Of course. Thanks, kiddo. Max? - Max, please. - What? Listen, bud, we gotta get moving, okay? So whatever bad feelings you have towards me right now, you gotta set 'em aside so we can get out of here, okay? Fine, but I'm not moving to the city. How we doing, Max? Gotta keep heading southeast. Can you tell how far away the house is based on the map? Uh... Navigating through the woods is a bit harder than it seems. It's okay, Max. You're gonna get us home, I know it. And Chinook here, he's great at finding his way. I've always dreamed of having a dog like that. Me too. He's the perfect dog for the wilderness. Well, I can guarantee you he's happy not to be towing me around anymore. Don't hit the tree, Dad, don't hit the tree. It's right there. Please don't hit the tree. So you have to go down a little. Yep, that's safe ground. - All right, boy. - All right. Chinook's right in front of you so be careful. Oh, great. Another river. I don't have much luck with rivers. This is the Bow River, Dad. We didn't have much luck with it either. All right, look, Max, do you think you know where we are now that we have a landmark? Uh, the Bow has so many tributaries, I have no idea which one this is. Okay, well, let's just try and get across, all right? - Yeah. - I don't feel like going for another swim. Okay, Dad, we can get you across. You're not gonna push me in, are you? It's tempting. Take the lead, puppy. Uh, the rock there. Here, right here is the rock. Uh, step a little closer, tiny step. Tiny step forward. And the next one is gonna be right here. Max is there, I'll go right after you, okay? Take my arm. - Chinook! - Next one is right here. Looks like Chinook's going ahead for us. - Okay, thanks, kiddo. - Okay. All right, next foot, just keep going to the front. - Keep... just in front again. - Okay. - There we go. - I'm gonna stay behind you now. - Okay. - There we go. All right. - On your back. - Okay. Erin will help you with this one. So, all right, move forward on this rock, right here. Yes, Dad, move forward, one more step. Right, now you're good. Keep going. Somewhat good. Here, the next one is here. - There? - There's one a little closer. Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh! You're in the water, Dad. - Erin, look! - I think you can feel water. So this rock kinda goes under. - I thought you would go a little bit farther. - Okay. There we go, a little bit farther this time. - Okay. - Keep going straight, Dad. Straight. Right here. - There we go. - Oh... - Are you okay? You look... - Oh, wait, no! That is totally not where you're supposed to go. I'm feeling like you're punking me. - I feel it all right, bud. - All right. Don't step right there, track it with your cane. All right, there you go, just keep your balance right there. Don't move your other foot yet. All right. - Go! - There we go. All right, next to shore, and then we have to climb up the ledge, okay? So just walk forward, keep walking forward. - I got you. - A little bit. - Watch out, Erin. - Hey, how far are you? - Right there. Right here. - Okay. And... there we go! We did it! That was scary back there. Talk about a leap of faith. - It must've been so hard for you, Dad. - Oh, it's okay. I couldn't have done it without you two. No more tributaries, please, Max. - It's not my fault. - Sure. It's okay. Guys, come on, let's just keep on moving. We all set, Max? Yeah, it's just a little bit farther. Okay. Erin, help him not bump into any sticks. He's okay. Wait, stop. Do you hear that? - I don't hear anything. - What, Dad? Just listen. - It's a plane, I hear it! - Max, Max! Take this, try and signal the plane. - Where'd you get this? - Don't worry about it, buddy. Just try and signal the plane. Does it see you? What's going on, bud? Max, does it see you? - He flew away. - We're never gonna get out of here. It's okay, Erin, it's okay. We're gonna be fine. Where did you get this? I got it from my cell phone. You smashed it? You just got that phone! - I know, buddy, I know. - How'd you know it was in there? I heard about it on the news. An IT worker got stranded in the mountains when his car broke down. He used the mirror to signal help. Pretty smart survival technique for someone who hates the wilderness. Let's just keep moving, all right? - What's the news? - A local pilot just radioed in. Said he thought he saw a flashing on the ground from this location. Is it them? What did they see? He was too low on fuel to circle back around, but he radioed the coordinates to us from the air. It's them. It's them, I know it's them. We don't have any teams in the area, quickest way there is by helicopter. Chopper's warming up. Let's go. Wait, wait. What is it, boy? It's a helicopter, guys. It's a helicopter and it's getting closer. Now this is as far as the pilot can get us into these coordinates. He's gonna set down and we'll walk in from here. Come on! - Easy. - Let's go. This way. Easy! - Did you hear that? - Yup! Come on! Aunt Susan! Aunt Susan! - Max?! - Aunt Susan! Oh! Aunt Susan! Max! Oh, my... I thought we lost you! Where is Erin? Is Erin okay? Yeah, she's okay. And in fact, we found Dad! Your dad's okay? He's alive? - Aunt Susan! - Hey! Oh, sweetheart! Oh, you're okay, you're safe. Oh, sweetheart. You're safe. Oh, you're safe. Hey. I thought I'd lost you guys. Thank you for coming for us. You've always had my back, sis. How did you find him? We had an entire army of people looking for him. Well, Chinook here led us right to him. Chinook gets to be the hero again, huh? He should live with us now. We'll see him again, Erin. - Aww. - You know, can we just... can we just all go home so I can sleep in my own bed for a change? Yeah. - Hey, bud. - Come on, Chinook. Put that over there. There we go. Everybody good? We're gonna have these three taken to the hospital, get 'em checked out. - Just to be safe. - It's okay, I don't have to go. - Oh, you're going, mister. - Max. Oh. Hi. Hi! For real? Dad, he's ours now! Well, the good news is, your aunt and uncle can come visit him any time they want. Hey, Dad, I've been thinking. After this experience, I now know that there's nothing more important to me than you and Erin. And Mom would always want us to stick together. I'm sorry for the things that I said. I don't wanna move, but I will. So we can stick together. Max, you know, I had a lot of time to think out there too. We don't have to move. Yeah. I can get a different job or I can telecommute. It's all the rage now anyway. But listen to me. You and I are gonna spend a lot more time out there together. Really, Dad? Can I get all new gear? Well, I guess you're gonna have to. Yeah, you can help me pick it all out. A backpack, a sleeping bag, a tent. Okay, first thing we need to do is take the house off the market.
