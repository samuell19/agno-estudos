Oh, that is beautiful. - Perfect. - That's the crown. That is the crown. Show mommy. Mommy, look! Is that me? - Duh. - Yeah, duh, mommy Well, it's beautiful. I especially love the red eyes. You want to hang it on the fridge?Yeah? I am almost done with this, and it is my first day at the office... I didn't make the rules. Fortune favors the bold. I knew you were going to throw scissors. I just love you that much. Are you okay? Hey, sugar, yes. Here we go. Oh, big happy family. You want to say hi to Amy? Yeah? Come here. - She's crying. - Yeah. She was. - Give her a kiss on the forehead. - Dad, wait, wait. - Can I put her pacifier in? - Yeah. - Yeah, right there. - Okay. Great going. You got it. - Is this right? - Yes. Good. Give her a little kiss on the forehead. Babe, you need to get up. Babe, we overslept. Great. It looks like it's going to be toaster tots again. Come on, you got to put your pants. Come on. Come on. Are you kidding me? Can you please take her? Good job. Good job. Here. Eat your food, all right? Morning sweetie. Mommy, where's Rachel? That is an excellent question. Did you not see the text? She's running late. Said she had a family thing. Oh, that will explain why this morning's been such a disaster. I'm glad you're text buddies with our young, beautiful nanny. Don't worry, I don't send her nearly as many winky faces I send you, honey. Keep eating. Oh, we forgot to open the gate again for the pool guys. Again. That is the third week in a row. Well, at least no one can see it back there. It's green and slimy! I know, sweetie. We'll remember next week. Yeah. - Are you done? - Yes. - Are you ready? - Yes. - Where's your backpack? - I left it in Kid Cave. We better go get it. We don't want to be late. I'm still waiting for my invitation to see the famous Kid's Cave by the way. Well, You know the rules. No adults allowed. So why does mommy get a free pass? Well, obviously, it's because we have such a strong - mother-daughter relationship. - Okay, that's it. Plus, she needed someone to decorate it. - Oh, no. - What's wrong? Eric just texted asking if I saw an email he sent. Oh, God, our Wi-Fi is down again! My meeting this morning got moved up. Do you have time to take Beth? I can't. I'm sorry, I'm showing a house on the opposite side of town, I'm sorry. As soon as Rachel gets here, I got to leave. Take out the garbage can before the trash guy gets here? I would love nothing more. Beth? Honey, time to go! Beth? Beth? Sweetie? Coming. All right. Come on, honey. Let's go. Raise your arm. Put this on. One arm. Ready? Two arms. This is for you. Keys. And you don't need it, but good luck. All right? - You're going to do great. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yes. - See you tonight. - And have Rachel fix the Wi-Fi. - I can do it. I know you can but she's a millennial, and she'll do it so much faster. I can do it. Bye. Let's go sweetie. Mommy is late for a very important meeting. Okay. - Need some help? - You have no idea. - Can you strap in Beth? - I'd love to. Thank you. - Hi there, angel! - Rachel! Oh, you're so cute. Let me take this off so I can strap you in. Rough morning, huh? Oh, just the world falling apart. I had a presentation that got rescheduled and now I'm late. Not a good first impression. Oh, if you'd like, I can take Beth to preschool. - Yay! - Yay. Wish you could, but Scott has to show a house - he needs you to watch Amy. - Oh. Of course. In that case, I'll see you later today, okay? - Bye. - Thanks, Rachel! - How may I help you? - Hi. Mara Franklin, - here to see Eric Messer. - It's okay, Clair. I can take her. The whole team's gathered. I had to stall. - This is not good. - Eric, I am so sorry. I don't know what's happening with our internet, - I didn't see the email. - It's LA. Okay? Ten minutes behind is, it's on time. It's fine. - Thank you. - Don't thank me. Help me convince the rest of the team that they want you. Shouldn't be too hard. Yeah? - Great. Great. - Come on. Lead the way. So, try not to think of me as someone who's interested in changing what you are. I love InHabit. I read it every month. And if you came over to my house, you would probably see that. The last thing you need is to change your content. But what I can help you with is making that content more accessible. Now, if you bring me on to handle your social media, I promise to help your marketing team reach an entirely new audience, and help them see what everyone in this room already knows... that InHabit is the best home and lifestyle publication on the market. Period. Congratulations. You earned it. I hope this office suits your needs? Eric, it's perfect. Thank you. Seriously. InHabit is my first really big client. - I couldn't have landed it without you. - Oh, please. All I did was open the door. You did the rest. Well, thank you for taking a chance on me. Well, to taking chances. I'll drink to that. I was just thinking we should go out and have dinner and talk strategy, you know? Celebrate properly. Yeah, you know, I would love to, but... Oh, yeah. No, no, I get it. Two kids. Last-minute plans don't really work. - Yeah. - Maybe tomorrow? - I'll hold you to it. - Okay. Babe, I swear I took it out when I left. Okay? I don't know how the truck missed it. It's fine. I believe you. Okay, I admit it. I am a garbage person who doesn't take out the garbage can in a timely manner. It's not about the garbage. - Okay, so what's it about? - I don't know. Everything. The yard, preschool, that stupid coffee pot that never works. The thousand tiny little things that go wrong every day. Then throw in a baby, a four-year-old... I get it. It's a lot but we're getting by. I had the biggest client meeting of my career today, and had I been any later... it would have all fallen apart. And luckily, Eric was there to smooth things over. Yeah. Thank God for Eric. Even with Rachel helping, it's like we're always treading water. If we keep trying to hold everything together like this, we're going to go crazy. I just feel like something needs to change. You're right. Things are crazy. But, honey, we knew what we were getting into when we adopted Beth. And if we were lucky enough to have a baby later down the line, it would be worth all the hard work. And it is. Okay, the things in life that matter aren't supposed to be easy. Yeah, but they'd at least be easier if... If what? If what, huh? If what? Go ahead, say it. What? If I pulled more weight? Are we really having this conversation again? Yeah, that's not what I'm saying. I know, you do a lot. But I feel like I'm still the one who has to remember everything. I don't want to have to worry about something getting done if I don't remind you to do it. You're right. Okay. I'll... I'll try harder. All right. I'm sorry. Okay? I love you. Let's not go to bed angry. - And there it is. - I'll go check on Amy. It's okay baby. Mommy is here. Is somebody hungry? Huh? Okay. Scott? Scott? - Where's Beth? - She's sleeping. What's wrong? - I think someone's in the house. - Someone's in the house? Scott, get back. Get back. What do you want? Get out of my house. - Are you okay? You sure? All right. - Yeah. Go make sure she's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Aside from the window to gain entry, the rest of the house is clean. You probably scared them off before they had a chance to take anything. What if they weren't trying to rob us? What if they were trying to hurt us or something? Well, from what your husband told me, they had the perfect opportunity to hurt him and didn't take it. Honestly, this looks like a smash-and-grab gone wrong. There's been a few B&Es in the area the past couple weeks, all nonviolent. Look, I wouldn't worry about them coming back. But if you want to discourage this from happening in the future, I'd look into getting a security system. - Do they really help? - They do. If you had one in the first place, I doubt your intruder would have made it inside. A little precaution goes a long way. - Thank you. We'll look into it. - Good. Feel free to call if you need anything else, Ma'am. Okay. - Thank you, Officer. - Get that alarm. - Hopefully, it won't be necessary. - Yeah. Thank you. I just don't think our safety is something we should skimp on. I don't either. Okay? I just want to make sure we're paying for what we need. Trust me, I show houses all the time... I just don't think we need a panic room. Did I say "Panic room?" I did not say "Panic room." - What do you think about this, Rachel? - Yes, Rachel. Please help me. I'm with Mara on this one. You can't put a price on a family's safety. Look, I get it. Okay? I'm not trying to get a bargain basement system just to save a couple bucks. I just want something that's going to do its job. That's it. You should get what my mom has. It's extensive. But we haven't had a break-in since we got it. - That's the point, isn't it? - Exactly. Just trying to deter people from breaking in - not catch them in the act. - Yeah, I get it. Me too. What's the name of the company? Ooh, I'm not sure. I need to ask my mom. I'll email you about it. Okay. Perfect. Okay. You ready, kiddo? - Ready. - Okay. - See you tonight? Okay. - Yeah. Okay. Say bye to Amy. Bye, Amy. - Okay. Let's go. Thank you as always. - You too. - Bye, angel. - Bye, Rachel. I should probably finish getting ready. Don't let me stop you. Oh. Hey, Eric. Hey. I heard what happened last night. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Thank you. Yeah, we're fine. Just, a little shaken up. I'm actually caught up in a home security spiral. Spent my whole lunch break reading up on it. - Scott thinks I'm overreacting. - No... Overreacting? I don't think you can when it comes to family. Oh, yeah. I heard about this company. They are crazy when it comes to automation. - Really? - Yeah. My sister got one. Syncs everything in the house. One push and boom! Lights, locks, alarms... All security systems too. All remotely monitored. I mean, she has cameras in every room, which I think is kind of nuts, but... I guess it has its appeal. - Does she like it? - Oh, she's crazy about it. Doesn't know how she lived without it. - Hey. - Hey. Can you be home in an hour? Yeah. I think so. - Why? What do you have in mind? - You'll see. - Be there soon. - Okay. Bye. Bye. What the... Yeah, so I checked it out online. The reviews look great. - You've nothing to worry about. - Hey! - What's going on? - Uh, don't be mad. I might've gotten a little impulsive but... I was talking with Rachel a bit more about it - and she gave me their number. - It's no big deal. Mara. I thought we were still talking about this. I... I'm going to go. Of course. Thank you, Rachel. Hey, Scott. It's just an estimate. I mean, I called them today for some pricing. And... they told me that they happen to have someone cancel today. So I figured what's the harm. - What are those for? - I thought we were... They're for you. - Thank you. - Hi. Dan, this is my husband, Scott. - Pleasure to meet you. - You too. So, look, I took a quick look. I don't think there's going to be any problem installing the deluxe package for the price I've quoted you. - I'm sorry, the deluxe package? - Oh, yeah. Top of the line. The best in security and home automation. Huh. Really? I'm sorry. Dan, do you mind giving us a minute? Sure. I'll wait by the van. Hey, I know you think this is crazy. But we can afford this. Look, I'm okay with you getting whatever security system you want. All right? But all this automation stuff... But we talked about this. And then we both agreed that something needs to change, right? Yeah. I want this. We need this. There's nothing wrong with getting a little extra help. I see what you're doing. Okay. Okay. Okay. So what's in the deluxe package? From a security standpoint, it's the best in the business. All right, I'm going to put one there. One camera up here. "It has an award-winning alarm response system." "There are cameras in every room, all with remote access" "that connect to an app on your phone." "The whole house is wired with microphone-enabled speakers," "so you can hear everything that's happening while you're away." "And every window gets a shatterproof film treatment." "But the icing on the cake is the home automation." "It connects everything, from appliances to the lights and thermostat..." "and automatic deadbolts on the main entry points," "which can't be picked, and respond only to your commands." "It all connects to a central hub that controls everything." "We call him SAM." "He connects to your phone to give reminders," "he can order groceries, and alert you when tasks are completed." "It's like having a virtual maid, butler," "and personal assistant all rolled into one." " And finally, the auxiliary control pads" " in the master bedroom and front door" "offer custom-tailored program cycles" " giving you peace of mind and monitoring everything" "while you sleep." So, are we supposed to do anything? I don't think so. I already programmed it to our schedule. Unless we're forgetting something. SAM, is there anything we need to do for tomorrow? "No. Everything is set." " But I do have a reminder that tomorrow is garbage day." It's impressive. All right. I'm on it. SAM, we're out of milk. "I see from your previous Instacart orders the brand you like." "Should I order more?" "I can have it delivered tomorrow morning." Please. - Thank you, SAM. - "You're welcome." "I could get used to this." Look at your little feet. They're super super cute. Yes. That's a good girl. - "Hey." - "Hey." Wow, someone's in a good mood this morning. Yes. Yes, I am. Does it have anything to do with our little new friend? I woke up early enough to enjoy a cup of coffee in the backyard. - Yeah? - I can't remember the last time - I was able to do that. - Yeah? And do you know what I saw back there? - Polar bear. - Our pool actually looks swimmable. Thank you for letting them in. I totally forgot. I didn't have to. They've their own personal code to the gate. - Only they have it. - Really? Just like that. One of our problems, gone for good. - I'm happy that you're happy. - Me too. SAM, any notifications? "You have an urgent email from Eric Messer." "Should I read it?" - No need. - Of course it's Eric. I'll read it myself. - Hey. - Hey. - I like that. No. - No homes today? Other than dropping off Beth, I do not plan on doing anything. You know what? Don't worry about Beth. I can take her. Really? You sure? I have so much free time on my hands I don't know what to do with myself. - Okay. - Speaking of... Where is that critter? - Kid Cave. Of course. - Yeah. - Morning! - Morning, Rachel. Looks like everyone's in a good mood today. I'm just excited to see the kids. I've got so much planned for us today. Actually, Rachel, how do you feel about having the day off? - Right? - Yeah. That's a great idea. I mean, we'll still pay you for the week, of course. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Everything's great. We just actually have everything under control for the first time. I'm going to stay home with Amy today. Sure. I mean, if you guys don't need me, then I'll... No, no, no. Go. Have fun. Be a teenager for the day. I'm not a teenager. I'm 20. Hey, ignore him. I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know how old I am. Of course I do. Twenty-three. Right? Seriously. Just go. Don't feel guilty at all. - No. - We'll see you tomorrow? Yeah, yeah. I'll see you guys tomorrow. - All right. Have a good day. - Bye. - You're back early. - Mara sent me home. Well... I suppose I don't blame her. I wouldn't want my husband home alone with a girl dressed like that. - Mom. - I'm just saying. Your father, God rest his soul, would never have let you leave the house like that. Well, I guess it's a good thing he's not around then. I'm sorry. Look, please, I didn't mean it. You don't get to hit me. You don't get to yell at me. And you don't get to do anything to me. Who do you think you are? How dare you say those things about me? You're pathetic! Don't you dare touch me? You don't get to do anything to me! "Are you ready to win again? Yeah?" Bitch. Hey. What's, uh, going on? I got caught in the sprinklers. You know, for a smart house it acted pretty stupid this morning. Oh. So you took the plunge. Do, do you love it? When it doesn't attack me, yeah, it's great. Oh, did you get my email? As a matter of fact, I did, I am already gathering numbers to show the team. Nice work, yes. I'll take a look at that when it's done. And... maybe we can discuss more over lunch? - Yeah. Sounds great. - Perfect. - I'll swing by in a couple of hours. - Okay. - All right. - Sounds good. "Hey, Scott Franklin. How are you?" "Good. So, the house on Wood lawn?" "Yeah, there's a big old leak in that roof." "So, I need to know if the buyers would like to take care of that themselves," "or if they would like to take it of the price of the house?" "So, get back to me. All right. Thank you. Bye." "You want this? Yes, you do" "How are you baby? You are just a little baby." "You are just a little baby with a big old giraffe in your face." Good? It's incredible. Sorry it's a little late. Thought it might be nice to wait until Beth went to sleep. "So we could enjoy a meal with just the two of us." "It's perfect." "I couldn't be happier." So, how did you do all this? Well, I happen to be an extremely capable adult who knows a thing or two about fine cuisine. Did SAM help you? Yeah, he literally read me the recipe book. This is dangerous. I could get used to this. - Yeah? - Take out the trash. Don't think I didn't notice you emptied the dishwasher. I know. I'm amazing. Now, you don't need to worry anymore. Now, a machine tells me what to do. You want to see something cool? SAM, play, play some mood music. "Playing "Mood Music" from Scott's playlist." - I have an idea. - Oh yeah. Yeah. - May I have this dance? - Yeah. Looks like you two got, uh... more acquainted today. Yeah, a little bit. Now imagine if you had to get up and turn on the music yourself like some sort of heathen? That is a world I do not want to live in. I'll admit, I was skeptical at first. I mean, I've seen Terminator enough times to know what happens when a machine gets too smart. So, what changed your mind? My mind didn't change. This is definitely going to end the same way. Maybe with a little less time travel. But in the meantime... let's just enjoy the ride. I'm already there. - Tonight was good. - Yeah. It was. "I know we're still getting used to all of this but..." "it's nice to feel like things are more manageable again." "Yeah." I was thinking... "How do you feel about cutting back Rachel's hours?" "Don't you think that's jumping the gun a bit?" "I'm not saying we let her go." But maybe the days you're working from home we might not need her. Maybe she can just come in a few days a week? I see what you're trying to do. You're trying to turn me into your househusband, aren't you? You'll always be my rugged man. Just, you know. A rugged man who folds laundry. Sure. And maybe once you get a couple big clients under your belt, you can start working from home, too. And then we can be domestic goddesses together. That's the dream. - So, what do you think? - About Rachel? I don't know. Let's see how the week goes. Once we get into our new groove, who knows? "Maybe we won't need her at all. Deal?" Deal. Hi. Hi. Beth? We have to whisper. Beth? Beth, honey, what are you doing? I was talking to SAM. You were talking to him? Why? I'm not tired. I just wanted to play. Okay, sweetie, you can't sneak out of bed like that. You scared me. - I'm sorry. - Okay. Hey... let's get you back to sleep, okay? Okay. Come on. "Goodnight" "Alert. Laundry load complete." - Mara? - In here. - Morning. - Morning. - You're up early. - Not as early as you. - Someone's been busy. - Yeah. I didn't sleep all that well last night, so... figured I'd be productive instead of tossing in bed. Well, that sounds awful. But I can't say I mind. Don't be too grateful. You get to fold. Yay! I'm going to go see if Beth's awake. Yeah, take your time. I still have a whole hour to kill after this. I Think I'm going to go for a run. - Excuse me, Sarah? - Yes. Hi, I'm Mara. You're Rachel's mom, right? She babysits our kids. I think we met once, when she first started working for us. Has she caused any trouble? I know she got sent home early the other day. Oh, no. No. Not at all. She's been great. We were just giving her the day off. And, honestly, I don't know what we'd do without her. Turns out a baby and a four-year-old are more than we can handle by ourselves. The security system also helped. I guess I should thank you for that, too. Rachel sent us the company you use. We don't have a security system. I'm not sure why she would make up such a thing. My daughter, she's a good girl. Usually. But she's troubled. Her father... I'm sorry, I should go. - Is everything okay? - Please, just go home. We shouldn't be talking. - What was that about? - What? I saw you talking to Mara. Yes, she saw me on the street and started talking to me. I couldn't just ignore her. - What did you say? - I didn't say anything. She just said hi. You better not be lying to me. I'm not. I hope so. God, it was just so bizarre. The whole thing. - And why would Rachel lie to us? - I don't know. I don't know, maybe her mom's mistaken. I have no clue. I... The whole thing, it's just... I don't know, seems very surreal. Yeah. I don't know what to think. Hey. I'll talk to Rachel today, okay? Look, I'm sure it's nothing. Just a... big misunderstanding or something. Yeah, you're probably right. I think I'm just tired. And now I get to go into the office and tweet about tiny homes. Take your time. Get ready. I'll take care of the girls. And by the time you get back, this will all be cleared up. Deal? - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. "Calendar reminder. Nap time for Amy." Thanks, SAM. "You're welcome." - I put her down already. - Rachel? - When did you get here? - Thirty minutes ago. Sorry, I let myself in because the door was unlocked and I didn't want to disturb you. Really? Lis... Do you mind if I talk to you in the living room? Of course. Anything you want. So, what's up? So, me and Mara were talking this morning um, about you. And how much we appreciate everything that you've done here with helping out with the kids and the house and everything. Trust me, it's been a pleasure. I love you guys. Yes. And we love you too. It's just... I mean, you probably don't plan on working for us forever, right? I mean, you're probably thinking about college and.. - career, moving... - Oh, no. I... I haven't even applied. I'm trying to save up. Besides, I would never leave you and Mara. Or the kids. And I can't leave my mom. I mean, she doesn't have anybody else. - Who's going to take care of her? - Yeah, so, about that... I have to be straight with you. Mara ran into your mom this morning. And... she said the conversation... It was kind of strange. What do you mean? Well, apparently your mom told Mara that you guys don't have a security system. And that... I don't know, you're... you're troubled. Something about your dad. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no! No, it's okay. All right? I'm just... I'm having a hard time understanding why you would... Why you'd lie to us? About something... so weird? No... I'm sorry that Mara had to see her like that. I didn't lie. I'm not the troubled one, she is. My dad, he was a bad person. He'd hit her and me. - Rachel, I... - No, no, no. - It's okay. - Okay. For years, we had to put up with it. We were too scared to tell anyone. He would get drunk, get angry and take it out on us. And even though things got worse, and... he would continuously hurt us, she still loved him. And even when he got drunk and... crashed head on into another car, she defended him. And when he died... she just lost it. She's never been the same since. She got depressed and took all kinds of medication. And it's just like her mind's gone. You know, when... she's at home, she's okay. But on bad days... Hey. Oh, come on. that's okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. Everything's okay. Tell you what. Why don't you... Why don't you take the rest of the day off? Okay? Go home and be with your mom. I can take care of everything here. No, no, no. Please, don't send me home. I want to stay here with you, with the family. Please. - What're you doing? - I'm sorry if I... Rachel, you need to go home. - Scott... - Rachel, go home! Right now. You cannot just push me away like everyone else. This is my family too. - You lied to me. - I didn't. Scott told me what you said. Now they don't trust me. Why are you trying to get between us? I know what you're up to, why you're always there with them. You don't know what you're talking about. Is it her you're fixated on? Or is it him? Shut up. I saw your computer. You've been watching them. It's sick. You don't get to judge me. Just because you're so scared of your little pathetic life doesn't mean I have to be. I want more. - I want what I deserve. - You don't deserve them. You deserve so much worse. You're not going to see them again. I won't let you. You're not going to do anything. That's what you're good at. "Beth?" "Beth, honey, what are you doing?" Get out of my room. - What are you doing? - I won't let you hurt that family. Even if I have to tell them myself. Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! This is for your own good. - Hi, Rachel. - No, it's Sarah. You need to listen. Keep Rachel away from your family. - Excuse me? - She's been spying on you. I saw it on her computer. Cameras, all over your house. - What are you talking about? - Promise you won't see her anymore. She's trying... No! No! No! Give... "Hello?" "Hello?" Hello? Hello? - Hey. - Where are you? At the house. Just got back from dropping off Beth. - "What's up?" - Is Rachel there with you? No. No, I sent her home. Hey, are you logged in to the Vault app? No. No, I haven't all day. "Look, Mara, we have to talk. Okay? It's about Rachel." Yeah, I know. I'm coming home early. Just, please, if Rachel comes back, - "don't let her inside." - Okay. Okay. I'll be home soon. I don't know. It just... It doesn't make any sense. I know it doesn't. And I don't know what to believe. I mean, her mom did seem off when I met her. Do you think Rachel was telling the truth? I think so. All right, the way that she was talking about her dad I don't think she was making it up. I don't know, doesn't that make more sense than her spying on us? I mean, why would she do that? What? You can't think of any reason why she might want to? I mean, it has just been the two of you lately... Come on. Scott, I know nothing happened. I trust you, but isn't it possible that maybe she developed some kind of crush? Yeah, there's one thing I didn't tell you. After she told me everything, I was trying to comfort her and... she kissed me. - What? - I know? Okay? But I sent her home right after that. - Why didn't you tell me this? - I don't know. Okay? Look, I'm sorry. I just don't... I don't think she knew what she was doing. Okay, she just unloaded all of this emotional baggage onto me, and I think she was just confused. Look, I was going to tell you, obviously. I'm just trying to make sense of all of this. You know what? Stay here with Beth and Amy. What? Where are you going? I am going to go see Rachel. I am getting to the bottom of this. - No, you're not going over there. - Yes, I am! Scott, our nanny could be spying on us right now. Watching everything we do, hearing everything we say. Oh, the thought of it makes my skin crawl. I'm not going to let some 20-year-old girl control our lives because of a crush. - I'm going with you. - No, you're not! You have seen enough of Rachel. We'll talk about this when I get home. Hello? Rachel? Sarah? I know somebody's home. And I'm not leaving until you talk to me. What? "Yeah." Rachel! Rachel? If you don't come out here right now, I am calling the police. What are you doing? I talked to your mother. I saw your room. And we know what you've been doing. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, give it up. And I can't believe you've been lying to us. - Watching us. - I'm only watching over the family. - Just like you. - It isn't your family! Of course it is. Who's the one actually taking care of your kids while you're at work? You've got to be kidding me. You know I'm right. You're barely home. Choosing your own career over your family. Somebody needs to be home with them. Loving them. Appreciating them. Your mom was right. You're crazy. I am not crazy! You are never allowed in my home again. If you try to come near us, or monitor us, I will call the police. And if you ever try to come between me and my family again I will come back here and I will deal with you myself. Understood? You can't do this to me. They're my family. They're mine. Mine. They're my family. They're mine. They're mine. I've never come across a breach this bad before. Any idea how she got access? She helps manage a lot of stuff around the house. - I mean, she has most of our passwords. - Yeah. And you didn't think to have a different master password for the device that controls your entire house? Yeah, well, we didn't really expect our nanny to be a psycho and spy on us. Sorry, didn't mean anything by it. - It's all right. - The good news is she can't get in from now on. Okay? Here's your new password. Don't let anyone else see it. I've also added a second layer of authenticity. So if you want to access the app, you're going to need to verify via your phones. And I've limited remote access to only your phones and laptops. No other device can sign in unless they're on your home network, have access to your phone, and know the password. Thank you for coming out so quickly. Ever since seeing her computer, I've felt so exposed. Yeah. Not a problem at all. I'm sorry this happened. We like to pride ourselves on being impenetrable, but... we never expect a threat to come from the inside, you know? - All right. You take care now. Sure. - Thanks. You too. - Thank you. - Yeah. You mind watching the kids for a couple hours? Yeah. Why? I just want to go get a couple of things for the house. Look, I'm glad we got the security system all sorted out, but I don't think I trust it on its own anymore. I just want to make sure we're safe. What do you have in mind? Hey. There's nothing to worry about, okay? Yeah, I know. I'm just making sure. I think I'm going to call it a night. Do you mind? - No. No, I should call it, too. - Okay. Beth? Sweetie, wake up. Rachel! Hey, we have to get your backpack and some clothes, okay? - Okay. - All right. Because I'm going to take you somewhere fun. I promise, it'll be so amazing. You want to come with me, right? Okay. Come on, sweetie. Come on, we have to hurry, though. Get up. We have to hurry. I've got something so fun planned for you. Stay here, okay? What are you doing? Stay out of this. This has nothing to do with you. I'm taking her with me. Are you completely insane? I'm not letting you take her anywhere. Come on, Beth. Come to mommy. - Let go. - Come on, come to mommy. Scott? Baby, it's okay. Rachel, what are you... Let go of her. Let go of her. Let go of her. Go with mommy. Go with mommy. Call the police. - Get out of my way. - Stop! - Hey! Stop! Stop! - Let me go! Now! - What do you want? - Get out of my way! - Relax! - No! - Stop! Rachel! - Let go! - Dan? - Sorry, Mara. I guess somebody was able to break in. I don't... Why are you here? - What's going on? - Let go! Get the kids and go somewhere safe. - Get out of my way. - Get the kids and go somewhere safe. - I don't want to leave you. - Get the kids and get somewhere safe! Okay, sweetie, I need you to stay inside the Kid Cave. I need you to be as quiet as you can and stay put. - Okay? - Okay. What's the foremost important rule? - No adults allowed in Kid Cave. - That's right. No matter what don't open the door for anybody, okay? - Okay. - Okay. I love you. Go ahead. Where are you going? It doesn't have to be like this, Mara. We can both have a family. If you're not going to let me be a part of yours, the least you can do is give her to me. Stay away from us. There's no way out. And I'd hate to hurt anyone. But I will. - No! No! - Go on! Get out of here! Oh, my God! - Are you okay? - No! Dan. Dan. Dan, get up! Get up! Here, here. I need to get Beth. - Where's Beth? - She's in the Kid Cave. I told her to stay inside until I could get her out of there. How're we getting out of this thing? I don't know. Get up! - You let them get away. - What? What? Luckily, they're still in the laundry room. So we still have a chance. - What if they call the police? - No, they won't. Their phones are in their bedroom and their only way out is the door, so fix this! - Do you have your phone? - No. Okay. What are you doing? SAM, activate the alarm. "I'm sorry. Security protocols have been overridden." "Please contact Vault Home Security..." - Damn it! - "to restore access." There is, however, an alternative. You can hand over Beth or you can wait until we break down the door. "And then you die." Sorry, I couldn't help myself. Enough games. Mara, open the door! Stop being so damn selfish. Sooner or later, we'll have to force ourselves in. All I wanted was my own family! Stop being so damn selfish! You have more than enough, Mara. At least they still think Beth is in here. But we can't just wait for them to break in. I know. What are we supposed to do? Come on. - It's okay. - I need you to stay here with Amy. What is that supposed to mean? They're both at the door, right? Listen, listen, if I can sneak out I can get to my phone and call the police. - No. No, that's too dangerous. - No. What choice do we have? We can't just wait for them to break in. Or find Beth. Open the door! We can't just leave her out there. She's all alone. I can do this. I can do this, okay? I'm going to get us out of this. - Who do you think you are? - Okay. - Okay. - Mara, open the door! Go over. Call the police. Get Beth and get somewhere safe, okay? - Please, be careful. Okay? - I will. - I love you. - I love you. Stop! Why are you doing this? You really don't know, do you? Know what? I'm sure you noticed that Rachel has a... type. I mean, you must have. I'll bet you wondered about her, home alone with your husband. - Scott would never... - Well, maybe not. But Rachel would. She has some serious daddy issues. Works for me. Yeah, her mother had the same look on her face when she found out we got together. Sarah was a good woman, but that relationship was never going to last. Rachel just has her way of, you know, just... sinking her claws into you. You know? She usually gets what she wants. And she wants her family. - So, I'm going to give it to her. - Dan! Bitch! Come on, fight me. Come on, fight me. Oh, my God! Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Mara! I know you're here, Mara. Please... Just let her go. You know we're way beyond that. Not so fast. - Drop it. - You first. I mean it! She's just a baby. You wouldn't hurt her. Do you really want to take that chance? Okay. Okay. Okay. Just, please... I see, seeing that you have that, Dan is... He didn't give me a choice. No... He served his purpose. He was only good for one thing anyway. So, what happens now? What happens now is you give me Beth and we leave. And if you try to stop us and call the police I will kill you, your husband and your baby. Why? Why are you doing this? You'll never understand. Then help me understand! I know about your father. What he did to you and your mother... and how it destroyed your family. And after he died, I can understand you wanting that family that you never had. But why like this? - Why us? - Because you don't deserve Beth! You never did! I did. I looked for her and never gave up. I kept looking and looking for four years. Beth is your daughter. I never wanted to give her up. I was only 16 when I was pregnant and my mother wouldn't let me keep her. She was jealous of us. She threatened to kick me out and she said I was ruining the family and I couldn't just leave her like that. She made me choose! And I chose wrong. It was the biggest mistake I've ever made. And I'll never make that mistake again. Rachel... I can't begin to understand how hard that was for you. - But this is not the way... - Don't tell me what to do! Give me Beth, now! You know I can't do that. I'm her mother, too. And you know better than anyone what I will do to protect that. Then you leave me no choice. I told you to stay away from my family. That's ok, mommy's got you. Come on. Come on, don't do this to me. You having trouble? I forgot how much I hate this thing. Well, we couldn't have at least kept the coffee maker? And you're the one that said that things that matter shouldn't be easy. Yeah, I did say that. Now you should be gloating. You were right. The machines won. I forgot how much of a giant piece of sh... There it goes. Success. - Heading to work? - Yeah. But I shouldn't be at the office too late tonight. Okay. Have fun. Good morning, Eric. "Good morning. To what do I owe the pleasure?" I just wanted to see if there were any fires before I dive in for the day. "No. We're all good. How's everything on your end?" "The new office going well?" - Yeah. It's perfect. - "Good." "Look, I just wanted to say I'm really glad that" "we could find a solution to keeping you on." "InHabit is now trending because of you." "Oh, that reminds me..." " I wanted to talk to you about our presentation." - "Maybe we can do lunch?" - I wish I could, but I've got lunch plans with the baby. "Yeah, I know. I figured I'd give it a shot." "I'll email you the deck." - Sounds good. Talk soon? - "All right." "Take care." Beth? Honey? Are you out of bed yet? Beth? Beth? I just wanted to play. We talked about this. Come on, hand it over. - Okay? - Okay. Let's get you some breakfast and get you to school, huh? Yeah? Okay, let's go. Come on. Yes, you do. You want some food? Okay. Who wants pancakes for breakfast? - I do. - I do. Yeah, pancakes. - Bye, SAM. - Bye, SAM. All right, baby girl. You want to help me make some pancakes? - Yes! - Okay. - Pancake time. - Let's get you up here. - Pancakes. Sit right there. - You want banana pancakes? - Blueberry pancakes? - No, thanks. "No, thanks?" Okay. Subtitled by Captivate Arabia Amman - Jordan
