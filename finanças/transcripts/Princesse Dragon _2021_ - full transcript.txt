Once upon a time, in the heart of a dark mountain, there lived a dragon in a cave so well hidden that no man could find it. This dragon was named Dragon. His hatred of humans was equalled only by the boundless love he had for his treasure. That fortune was his pride and his joy. And yet, our friend Dragon had grown very sad. Just imagine! He was the only being in the forest that could not have children. What good is hoarding wealth if one cannot share it? So the sad Dragon plucked up his courage and took to the skies, on a quest for someone who could help him. His journey was long indeed, even for a dragon. And just as he was about to turn back for his cave, that is when he saw me for the very first time. Who am I? A witch with a frog's head or a frog with a witch's body? Good question! My lord Dragon ! Greetings, Frogwitch. I have a problem. And I have a solution! You know my problem? It is my business to know everything. It's obvious. You want children. Sit on these three seedlings for three months and when you have dreamt thrice, then joy will replace your sadness. And when you are beside yourself with rage,, I will return to claim your second most prized possession. My second most prized possession? It's a deal it couldn't be more simple. Frogwitch, I sense trickery, but if you will enable me to have children, I will keep our pact. And so Dragon sat on the seedlings for three months. Thrice he dreamt. And on his waking... he found that I had kept my promise. Your limbs are made of stone. You'll be called Rock! I'm pleased to see that you like the name. Light as air and carried by the wind. You will be Brezee. No? Stubborn, I see. How about Gust? What do you think to Zephyr? Good. Now we welcome your younger sibling. But the younger sibling was a very special dragon. Huh? But this is... A disgusting human! Frogwitch! A little human. What a lovely gift from the heavens! Flames? The little one spits fire? It seems despite your horrible appearance, you are indeed my daughter. And you will be called Bristle. She's magnificent, my queen. A real little princess! A daughter? We'll find some use for her. Keep moving! Don't block the gateway. Move it! Hurry up! This fish doesn't look fresh to me. You want to make us all sick? - Don't block the gateway. - Halt, old man! - Keep moving. - Show me what you've got there. Keep moving! (From the queen.) Thank you. - Morning, father. - Good morning, daughter. Did you sleep well? Yes, I dreamt that you flew again. Stop grousing, Pony. We're lucky to be able to leave the castle. It's lovely here. I know you'd rather sleep, but a little exercise will do you good. You've put on weight recently. - A bird maybe? - The truth hurts. Hello! You're pretty deep in the woods. Are you lost? Mind your manners! Don't you know who I am, you little savage? I could have you flogged for that! You'd be thrown in a dungeon, if I told my father. Believe me, you wouldn't want to be in my father's dungeons. If you'll excuse me, I have things to do. She has some odd manners, but she seems harmless. Well, well! Aren't you Dragon's daughter? Yes, that's me. Bristle! Bristle... We met once before, a long time ago. I am Bourya, the most powerful animal in this forest. My father's more powerful! We could argue that, But it doesn't matter, child. What matters is that this human is going to be my lunch. - No! - No? You would tell me "no"? What I find on my territory belongs to me. I found it. It's Bristle's! Your damned fire! Go now, Bourya ! Your lot stick together. You've never been a part of this forest. You're like her. A monster on two legs. A human. Thank you for saving me. My name is Princess. It's a bit pretentious, But I didn't pick it. Princess! - Princess. - Princess. Yes, that's right! And you are? - Bristle! - Bristle? How original. Pleased to meet you. Thank you for saving me from that big bear's claws. Very kind. Actually, I was saying to Pony that... My pony! Hello, Pony! Pony? But my name's not Pony. My name is Fiduval, son of the legendary Gucephalus. And I am Bristle, daughter of the mighty Dragon. Bristle? Some people suit their horrible names wonderfully. What? Are you saying I'm horrible ? Horribly hairy! I should have let the bear eat you! I see you've met. Pony, took quite a hit just then. Not Pony. His name is Fiduval. Yes! Fiduval? How do you know that? He told me. You can talk to animals? I've never heard of anyone who could do that. That must be useful. It's been lovely,, but I should be on my way. Way? Yes, I'm going to get some books. Bristle's coming! With pleasure, Bristle. How kind of you to offer. It's a rather dangerous place. We'll have to go all the way to the hills. - Coming! - Excellent! A little wild company wouldn't do me any harm. Oh to be wild! I was surprised to meet you so deep in the forest. Where do you live? I suppose your parents don't have enough money to buy you clothes. There are so many people going hungry or without a roof over their heads. Winters are hard for them. What's funny about tha? It's very serious you know. You shouldn't laught at others' misfortunes. You talk a lot. Yes. Sorry. You're right. You're not the first person to have told me that. It's pretty. It's like the birds singing. Don't understand it all, but it's pretty. Thank you. The city was destroyed a long time ago. Destroyed? Why? Because of a war. And wars are always about gold in the end. - My father has lots of gold. - Really? Tell him to hide it if he doesn't want any trouble My father's the one who makes trouble for others. Well then he's a lot like mine. Believe me, there's always someone stronger and more greedy. Here's the library! It's one of the least damaged buildings. Seems the soldiers weren't very interested in books. Here we are! Careful where you step! It's very dangerous! One time I slipped and fell right on my butt. That taught me a lesson. - What is that? - What? You've never seen a book? You can learn an awful lot from reading them. This one is about magic. Magic? "Magic, pacts et spells", "Black magic and bewitchment"... Maybe we'd better skip that one. "Magic and alchemy", "Cooking and magic". I'm looking for a spell to turn me into a boy. It'd be so much simpler that way. What would you want, if you could change? Wings! Huge and powerful! Flying... You're right that must be wonderful. I'll take a few novels for mother. She loves them. Shoot! That's all we need! At the gallop, Fiduval! Fiduval the daring wonders if we should maybe go a bit faster. I think you're right, little Fiduval! What do you mean, "little" ? You... You can fly? No, that's not flying. I'm coming! A little late, but I'm coming. Princess, you're sleeping at Bristle's. Won't your parents mind? No. My father and my brothers are very nice. Alright. You really live here? Fiduval doesn't like this, not one bit. Have you lived here lone? Father has been here for centuries. Is that a figure of speech? Her family is so poor that they live in a cave. Just look at all this gold! Oh, no! Bristle? I don't know if this is such a good idea. (- Are you awake, father?) Not really. Today, in the forest, I met an animal that looks like me. She talks with her mouth, like this, not in her head like us. Her voice is really, really pretty. Her talons are round, like mine. An animal that looks like you? The bear Bourya called her "human". A human? They are evil creatures whose only thought is to destroy. I hate them. If I meet one, I eat it. But I look like her, and yet, you don't eat me. You have the heart of a dragon, not the heart of a human. That's all that matters, daughter. The one I met was kind. What? You brought one here? Into our home? Father! Are you mad? What's going on? Oh dear! You! Princess! Stop! What's gotten into you? Bring me that human! You don't know what they're capable of. If you let her go, she will come back with an army to steal from us and destroy us. No, father! Princess is my friend. She'd never do that. That's enough! No! Bristle! Hello, my dear Dragon. You? You're certainly angry. Tell me, what is your second most precious possession? You've picked a bad time, Frogwitch. What will you give me? One of those fine hatchlings? No! I love Zephyr just as much as Rock and Bristle. Bristle... Yes? That is my second most precious possession. Take her, Frogwitch. That I never have to see her again. So be it, Dragon. But I don't see her anywhere. It's your fault she causes me so much trouble. Find her yourself, accursed witch! What? Those were not the terms of our bargain. I will return for my prize at the next full moon. If your daughter is not here, I will take your sons. Until then, you and your children, will have neither fire nor wings . I thought I was going to die. I thought we were all going to die. Bristle! My father doesn't love me anymore. What's wrong with you, Bristle? I'm not a real dragon. Because I'm like you. A monster on two legs. Bristle! Oh no! Not today! Look at the state of you! Like a doormat. Makes me gag to think how you got like this. Being a princess is more than just being called Princess. Blah, blah, blah. You have lessons with your mother. Your visits are the only thing that gives her strength. Then, you'll meet your betrothed. Mercy, Mimi! No mercy for little savages! I'll get you some proper clothes. Clean yourself up. (- Bristle ?) Can you hear me, Bristle? Tell me how I can wake you up. I miss you already. You saved me all day long even though you didn't know me. I'd love it if we could be friends. Bristle? Is that true? You want to be friends? It would make me so happy. Where am I? In my room, I brought you back last night. It's so soft. Who is this? It's Bristle, my friend. Your friend? Exactly. My friend. You know you can't just bring commoners into the castle. Get her out of here. This is the first time I've brought anyone here. And bristle is very special. Oh! Even her name is special. Not to mention that horrendous man. She must have lice. The girl's completely nude? Nude? Be nice, Mimi, it's her first time meeting other humans. You read too many stories, Princess. Well she won't stop you learning how to act like a lady. You need yo go see your mother... And breakfast with my husband to be. I know, I know. But what about Bristle? I think I can find her something. I'll be back. That's strange. It looks like you've grow. Yes, a little. You need to be careful. You can't act like a dragon. I'm not one anyway. Let's get dressed. Or we'll be late. And when you have Mimi as a governess... You're never late. Do you like it, Bristle? Yes. Come on! No time to make adjustments. Out of the way children, thanks! Almost there. Just the hard part left. The staircase of suffering. There. Right on time. You're perfect. Thank you, Mimi. You're welcome, my princess. Give your mother a kiss from me. As you can see, mother is imprisoned here. Why? She gave my father's gold to people who needed it. When he found out, he went mad with rage. She won't be let out until she apologises and promises not to do it again. (But she's too proud) (to do that.) Good morning, mother! Good motning, daughter. - Did you have a good night? - Less eventful than yours. Mimi already told you? Of course, she is my best friend. I have a friend too. May I present, Bristle. We met in the forest. Hello. Hello, Bristle. What magnificent hair! You need to let it breathe. I brought you a new book. How kind of you, daughter. Come sit, Bristle. You know, all those stories and legends about dragons and witches, now I'm sure they're real. Oh? There is always an element of truth to the legends. So, you are my daughter's friend? And you're not very talkative. No. Princess deserves to have a friend as exceptional as you. Take care of her. Yes. It sounds like your betrothed is back from his hunt. Don't forget that being a princess, is knowing how to remain dignified under any circumstances. What a hunt, Jeannot! Reward the dogs for their hard work. We normally bag a lot, but this is unheard of. Just the thing to impress my promised. She'll see just what kind of man I am. Indeed, messire Albert. She would have to be blind not to see the sturdy and handsome young man you are. His lordship Count Albert! Princess isn't here yet? She won't be long. Late again. Like every self-respecting princess, Count Albert. That habit will have to go when you are my wife. I don't like people who are always late. I see you have brought along a lady-in-waiting. Greetings, mademoiselle. I am Albert, Son of Count Roflon. It is a pleasure to have you at our table. Ah! Strange manners indeed. Bristle is a little wild. She's not from here. Her name is bristle? Really? Indeed, wild seems to be the right word. Who is all this for? - For us. - We can't eat all this. "Wild" is definitely the right word. This is the minimum for those of our rank. Where did this strange creature come from? People are starving out there, and we... Oh, no, my dear! Don't bring up those useless people all around us again. If they wanted to eat well, they should have been born well. Don't let your mother's ideas get into your head. You see where that got her. Let's talk about your hunt this morning. That would be more bearable. Oh, Princess, it was such a good hunt. Unheard of, to tell the truth. We can do better than talking about it, Let me show you the result. Come. Your friend has spoiled my appetite. The hunt is without a doubt the greatest of arts. It demands discipline, patience and courage. Jeannot! I want to show this morning's catch to my betrothed. To be sure, your greatness. Follow me. Look, Princess! He's immense, gigantic! A monster! Do you realise the feat I accomplished, in capturing this beast? And alive, to boot. It's the bear that attacked us. Bourya? He must have followed us. Why is he locked up too? Why? We're going to eat him, of course. We'll make sausages and pâtés. The whole castle will enjoy the fruit of my hunt and thank me. And Princess, I've had the most divine idea. We will mount the head of this monster right above our bed and use its fur for our son's bedding. You... I was right. Your kind stick together. Damned human. I'll get you out of here. I didn't ask you for anything. - Go, go back home! - My bear! Jeannot, do something, imbecile! I don't know where you came from, but I'm going to show you how I treat my animals! Yes, yes, good. Teach her a lesson. One she'll remember. She's as slippery as an eel. And she bites like a beaver. Fire! She spits fire! Guards! Sieze her! Bristle! You think you scare me, humans? I am the daughter of Dragon, the lord of the forest! Ouch! Your head will decorate my bedroom, in place of that bear's. How could Princess spend her life with you? Guards! Have you gone mad? I'm sorry Bristle, it's all my fault. I never should have brought you here I couldn't let them hurt Bourya. I know, Bristle. I know. You would dare attack a lady? I wonder what my father will say, when I tell him. Oh but we'll explain it to him together, my sweet. Bristle! Didn't I warn you, daughter? Humans are evil. You cannot trust them. She's not human. We saw her spit fire. She called herself daughter of Dragon. Thank you, Albert. The girl's waking up, she can give us her version of events. Bristle! My head hurts. You're doing rather well, after giving little Albert and my soldiers a good hiding. And my Jeannot, highness! Look what she did. She broke everything. That's not so impressive. They're weak. They only beat me because they have no honour. You seem to stron-willed, Bristle. That is your name, yes? You know for wounding a noble, who is also my future son-in-law, the punishment is death. Aren;t you scared, Bristle? Why should I be afraid of what I don't know? It's in man's nature to fear the unknown. But you aren't human, are you? An ordinary girl couldn't beat so many men. Her father is a dragon. You already said, and I believe it. I know a dragon when I see one. I like dragons. I love them, even. And our friend, Bristle has that look I know well. My daughter tells me you saved her. Yes. Without Bristle, I would have been eaten by a bear. So, I am faced with quite a dilemma, my girl. I must punish you and I must reward you. But perhaps we can find a compromise, daughter of dragon. You tell me where I can find your father's lair And we are even. Never! You should thank me. My father hates humans. If he sees you, he'll eat you. Very well. If that is your decision. Mercy, father! She's my friend. Your friend has made her choice. I can't help her. The sentence is death. No, I... I know where their lair is. Really? No! Princess! If you're really my friend, don't say a word. I'm sorry Bristle, but I can't let them hurt you. No, Princess! You don't know what they're capable of. If we let her go, she will come back with an army... TO STEAL FROM US AND DESTROY US. Now I know, father. It's no good, children. The frogwitch's magic is too powerful. Father never should have given Bristle. Don't take that tone with me, Zephyr. Father who gives away children is bad father. She;s the spitting image of you. What do you want? Don't look at me like that. I am your king and your husband. I am the ruler of a kingdom. I have to make difficult decisions for the greater good of the people. You don't think of the greater good when you starve your people. or when you take our only daughter from me to marry her off to that little imbecile. You only think of yourself. Gold makes the world go round. The more I have, the greater my power. Your only thought should be the good health of your subjects. That's enough! I'm going to hunt a dragon. If its fortune is as vast as I think it is, I won't need to marry Princess off anymore. And perhaps you can come out of this prison. You're lying to yourself. If you had the world, you would leave to hunt the stars. You are too wise for me, my love. I can't fight it. I have to do something. Of course. Otherwise you wouldn't be my Princess. Mimi will be happy to help you. I hear the birdsong In the sky At the foot of the tree By the water's edge Where on your wings I can rest You can tell me How... Save the world from the hands of men Before all turns to dust Without making war, the autumn wind Will carry us to the light Save the world, that our mothers' mighty voices be heard again And for the war, we forgive you If you let us remake everything Pardon, messire. Poor woman. Jackanape! Oh, my back! Do I have to collapse before someone gives me a hand? Thank you, my boy. I'm bringing our queen's lunch. There's a lot there! The honey cakes are for you. Boys, lady Mimi's thought of us. And where's the little on? She must still be in her egg. Didn't hear her all night. Hey! Isn't it wei... Here we are! You need to teach me how to bake. So you can use it against me? Never against you, Mimi, I promise! And thanks for your help. Bristle! If you want to help your family, you'll have to come out of there. My father's gone to fight yours to steal his gold. I'm sorry I told them where to find your cave, but I had no choice. Now you need to wake up. I could never forgive myself if you didn't wake up. Bristle! I won't let it end like this. What are you doing? I'm getting her out of here. They're here! I knew they were plotting something. Leave that egg there! Block the door, Mimi! No! Push! - We're trapped. - Princess! Open this door immediately. That's an order. An order? Who does he think he is? I heard that, you'll answer to the king, you old doxy. Oh sure, pipsqueak! Hold on, Mimi! It's just a few men. How many of them are there behind that door? Catch them! Hurry up1 They're getting away! Oh! The window, Mimi! - Are you sure? - No time to think twice. Careful on the landing! Well done, Princess! Albert, what are you doing? Nothing that concerns you. You should know that my husband will hear of your attitude.. I am more loyal to him than you ever were. Wahoo! You think you're smart? Give it to me. Never! You will obey your husband to be! I'm coming, Princess! They're over here! Hurry up! I've got her! Out of the way, ruffians! I am here, Princess. When we're married, you'll sleep on the ground! Right, Fiduval ! I am your princess. Let me pass. Impossible. The king's orders are explicit. You may not leave. Bristle! Please! Don't make things more complicated than they need to be, Princess. Bristle, if you can hear me, it's now or never. Bristle? Please forgive me. I'm your friend, Bristle. Friend? My father left early this morning. Your family is in danger. So let's not waste any time. With me! Please try not to hurt them too much. The hard part's over. Oh, no! The hunting pack! Albert set them on us. Go on, boys! It's feeding time! Tally-ho! Hey! Bristle! Fiduval! It's good to see you again. You too! I'll buy you some time. What's going on? Fiduval wants to play the hero. Fiduval the proud does not play, he acts. Bristle, look out, the side! Hold on! Princess! Bristle! Bristle, are you okay? My head's spinning a litt;e. I'll give them a taste of my favourite toy: "the alberalest". Princess! How could you take a shine to her? She's neither dragon nor human. Look at her, she's hideous. She's nothing but a freak of nature, a monster. She has no place her. Bristle! That's the first time I've ever missed my mark. I only see one monster here, and that's you! You dare raise your hand against me? Worse still, you dare speak to me like that? Associating with that creature has made you lose all sense of decorum. Not my lovely hair! You gather your strength, Bristle, I'll take care of him. No! Stop, Princess. You're hurting me. Look at the state I'm in. Unkempt hair, bruised. Do you think this befits a princess? You've nothing of a gentleman in you. Bristle, are you alright? You're right. I'm sorry. Will you help me up? Absolutely not. You deserved that and more. Oops! Looks like I let my emotions get the better of me. Sorry, Princess. I'll have to find myself someone less annoying to marry. What now? Hold on tight, Princess. Bristle! You're flying! You're a real dragon. Incredible! This is worth all the treasure in the world! What do I have to do to get rid of you? No! Damned humans! I'll destroy you all! Soldiers! Shoot! Father! Children, hide! What are you protecting, Dragon? How disappointing! I've known lambs that put up more of a fight than this dragon. Round up the little ones while I finish him off. Father, stop! Father! Princess? What are you doing here? You're already so rich! What could you possibly need more for? A man can never be rich enough, daughter. Go back to the castle, before you get hurt. No! No! That's enough! No more fighting! Go on, great king. Help yourself, since you're only interested in gold. I don't need your permission. And your father can't stop me. Bristle! Let me go! Make way, soldiers. Papa... Can you ever forgive me, daughter? There is nothing to forgive. I know I'm different. Of course you'd prefer Rock and Zephyr. They're more like you. No, Bristle. I acted badly. I've been a bad father. I love you all so much, you, Rock and Zephyr. You are all three my children. My most precious possessons. I give my second most precious to the frogwitch: my treasure. What, it's... witchcraft! No! It's frogwitchcraft. No! My gold! Give me my brothers! Right now! Bristle! Sister of Rock is back! Rock happy! I missed you. Me too. TYou have payed me, Dragon. We are even. It was a pleasure doing business with you. You drive a hard bargain, frogwitch. You! I command you to stay there! He commands me! Be happy! What was that creature? Father! Forgive my obsession, daughter, but a king must follow his ambition. No, father. A king must do what is right. You grow more and more like your mother. Do what is right in my absence. Men, let's go! We have a treasure to find and a witch to fight. My father says: "have no fear, little girl, I won;t try to eat you anymore." How reassuring. The king was never seen again. Some say that he got lost while digging for treasure. Others that he and his soldiers were turned into tadpoles after angering the frogwitch. In any case, one thing is for sure, they found trouble. As for Princess, she became queen of a kingdom which no longer knew hardship. All the king's gold was shared so that all had enough to eat, a roof over their heads and land to farm. No-one was mad enought to attack the kingdom or besiege it because everyone knew that Princess had a powerful ally that slumbered in the forest. A friend that hunted, roared, breathed fire and, of course, flew like a dragon. That friend was called Bristle. She too was a princess. The dragon princess. I hear the birdsong In the sky At the foot of the tree By the water's edge Where on your wings I can rest You can tell me How... Save the world from the hands of men Before all turns to dust Without making war, the autumn wind Will carry us to the light Save the world, that our mothers' Mighty voices be heard again And for the war, we forgive you If you let us remake everything In your hair In the colours of the sun There is the promise of a new world In which You can rest I can tell you How... Save the world from the hands of men Before all turns to dust Without making war, the autumn wind Will carry us to the light Save the world, that our mothers' Mighty voices be heard again And for the war, we forgive you If you let us remake everything And in all this, we will Finally find freedom We will cherish it Like a fine rain in summer Like a hug Every time that fear Makes us doubt our way We will sing lalalala Without stopping, that sweet refrain Save the world from the hands of men Before all turns to dust Without making war, the autumn wind Will carry us to the light Save the world, that our mothers' Mighty voices be heard again And for the war, we forgive you If you let us remake everything
