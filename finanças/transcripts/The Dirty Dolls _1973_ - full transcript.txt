Come on, Nancy, get your act together. Was it a heck of a ball game? It's about time they've won. Don't I know it. It's about time they've won? They've won nine out of 10 games. I thought they won. Would you like to have another one, Harry? I'm good with this one. Don't rush me, don't rush me. What the hell is this mess? Jeez, that's the God Squad. Get rid of them, goddammit. The trouble with you, Harry, is you've got no religion. Give them a buck and they'll disappear. Those goddamn kids, they're ruining my business. Oh shit, why don't you go and beat that somewhere else? Peace and love, sister. Peace and love. Hey, what the hell is this? Plug that box back up. Hey, asshole. Shut that cow in your mouth and open the till. Keep looking at me like that and you're gonna have another eye in your head. And none of you people at this bar move. All right, brothers and sisters. Dig down deep, it's collection time. Just pretend you're in church. Sure. Rings, watches, jewelry, bracelets, everything. Go on, give everything up. All right, come on, hurry up. Get it in the bag, hurry up. Come on, nice and easy, it's painless. Painless my ass. Terrible language to use in front of a lady. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Get up! - Get his wallet. - Everybody! Come on, hurry up, get it in there. Get it in the bag. Just pretend you're in church. Hurry up, we haven't got all day. All right, get your rocks off. God bless you, brother. Move. Good. Okay, ladies. Let's get outta here. Take it. Ginger, behind you! Hey, you, everyone here. Just keep right close on all seats. Glad I don't have to wear that shit ever again. Well, almost went off perfectly. You did a good job, Ginger, taking care of that hero boy. Yeah, great. Too bad we can't say that about the newest member of our group. She may be your sister, Johnny, but she better get more involved or I'm out. Knock it off. No way! I'm not gonna go hustle some yo-yo while she stands around and pick her nose. Uh-uh, I'm not laying my ass out on the line if she's not gonna back me up, even if she is your sister. That's right, baby, she is my sister. So you keep your yap shut or I'll break every bone in your face. No, Johnny, no, no. Look, she's right, I don't do all that I should, but Ginger, I'll do better in the future, I promise. Come on, I'll help clean you up. Shit! Imagine that broad giving me trouble. We did good, Johnny, we all really did. Stash that shit, Sherry. Tired? Yeah. Bone tired. It's almost like working for a living. Come on, I'll rub you down. Yeah. God, he's got a hell of a set of knuckles. Yeah, tell me about it. I've seen it before. Brother of yours can really be a bastard sometimes. Then why do you stay, Ginger? Are you serious? Where am I gonna go? And who with? No, Dee Dee, he's no good. But he's all man. And that's why you stay? Maybe. You know where his head's at. He doesn't come home with a shiny line of bullshit. Johnny knows how to take care of business. I see. Besides. He's great in the sack. But then... You wouldn't know about that, would you, Dee Dee? Good? Oh yeah. That was a rough little job. I agree. Oh, it feels good though. Mmm, oh yeah. Through here, there's an office on the side that's seldom used. The cart is almost always empty. Over here's the waiting room. How many people are we gonna have to deal with? Two, plus a guard, who's always in the front office. Carmichael's office is right here. If your timing is right. Pacific Diamond Exchange. I've never heard of it. When was the last time you had a diamond cut? Just what is this place, Johnny? It's a wholesale diamond and jewelry company. Diamonds just don't jump out of the ground. My contact doesn't want any cut diamonds. Too easy to trace. Just how did you find out all these things, Johnny? By casing the joint. That's why I can't go with you. Some idiot down there might remember me. That makes sense. That's right, baby, I always make sense. Gonna be all right, Dee Dee? Now you girls get your stuff ready. - Okay. - Okay. Dee Dee. Sit down now. One slip and we've got problems. Oh Johnny, I'll be fine, really. You remember how poor we were when we were kids? Yeah, I remember. And it's just you and me, little sister. I'm gonna give you the kind of life I should've given you a long time ago. Send... Ginger in here. Why? I want her to read my horoscope. Sure, Johnny. Gently, gently, Miss Staples. Clumsiest nurse I've ever had. Yes, Mrs. Dewitt. Oh, yes Mrs. Dewitt, yes Mrs. Dewitt. That's all I ever get from you. I'm sorry. Oh don't be sorry, don't be sorry. Just get the elevator going. Hello. Well yes, how may I help you ladies? Yes, we're here to see Mr. William Carmichael. Mr. Carmichael expecting you? Yes, I'm Betty Delaney and this is my sister Sheila. We've made an appointment. Delaney. Ah yes, he's waiting for you right now. Why don't you go on in? Thank you. - Thank you. - It's down the hall, first door to your left. Wonder what kinda diamonds they can buy. Oh young man, must you smoke that infertile smelling thing in these confined quarters? I'm very sorry, madam. Yes, I should think you would be. There's no consideration these days, Miss Staples. I mean, when I was a young lady, we knew how to behave. I'd like to send this man back there. Suffocating, it's all over the place, I can't stand it. Oh bullshit. Yes. Now I understand that you young ladies have come into considerable wealth. Yeah, our father's estate just came out of probate and we'd like to invest some of it in a commodity, such as diamonds. Yes, well. I'm sure that we can accommodate you. Just what kind of stones are you interested in? The best, the very best. Ah well certainly. But that takes in a lot of territory. Let me put it this way. How much money are you prepared to invest in what kind of stones? Well, how much money do we need? Well, that depends on the stones. It could go as high as, oh... Say, $100,000. For an uncut gem. Oh, that's too bad. I beg your pardon? Well actually, Daddy didn't leave us money. But he gave us a wonderful idea on how to get some. I... I don't think I quite understand. Maybe I can clear it up for you, Mr. Carmichael. We're here to take, not buy. Oh. Oh, oh my goodness. But, but, but, but... But, but your ass. Get into that safe and empty it. Oh. Oh my goodness. Don't, don't... - Move it, you little weasel. I can't do what you ask. No, I can't do what you ask because the safe is locked. So, open it. I can't. We were gonna close earlier today so the time lock is set and it can't be opened 'til nine o'clock tomorrow morning. Find out. I don't like you. And if you're lying, I'm gonna take great pleasure in blowing away the back of your head. Yes, of course. I mean, no, no, I'm not lying. He's right, it's locked. All right, you answer it. And you be real careful. Yes? I'm ready to leave with today's shipment. Will there be anything else, Mr. Carmichael? What shipment? What shipment? Today's delivery of diamonds to the downtown exchange. Get him in here. Mr. Carmichael, are you there? Yes, Ralph. Could you please come into my office? Yes sir, right away. Now listen, weasel. When he gets in here, you be nice, okay? Yes, yes, of course, but please, please be careful with the guns. How dare you, young man. If I say I have an appointment, I have an appointment. Oh yes, ma'am, it's just that I can't seem to find any record of it here. No record? No record? Those machines, I just know it. Those confounded machines. Well now, ma'am, if you'll just be calm, I'll see what I can do. Calm? I, young man, am perfectly calm. Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, I know. Would you spell the name for me again, please? No! You'll never get away with this, you know. Hmm. That's what they used to tell Jessie James. Dope? Oh, that's what it is. Narcotics, I just don't understand you young people. Don't feel bad, Daddy. We don't understand you either. Yes, Ralph. - Yes, Mr. Carmichael. - Come in, Ralph. Put it on the desk, quick. Oh Christ, man, it's chained to him. That's right, it is. You're not going to open this here or anywhere else. Besides, the key's downtown. You'll never get away with this, I promise you. - He hit it. - I know. Nice going, Mr. Carmichael. You better know to figure this out. I know that, ma'am. I mean, yes ma'am, I'm doing everything I can to help you, believe me. I see you for every penny that you have. - What the hell? - Hold it. Freeze, hands behind your back. Hand me that rock. All right, we're taking you with us, move. You take care of him. What are you gonna do to me? I've got a wife and kids. Everybody's cuffed. Where the hell are they? - Did you get the stuff? - Yeah, I've got it. Let's get outta here. Who's he? We've gotta take him with us. He's on the other end of the stones. Let's go. Move, man, move. All right, get in there, move. Get over there. Oh shit. What are we gonna do with her? I don't know. Gets more complicated by the minute, doesn't it? - Shut up. Who are you people anyway? What's going on here? Why don't you give up while you have a chance? Let me off this elevator immediately. Why don't we just blast her? Are you crazy, there's a guard in the lobby, remember? Oh shit. Just shut up. - What is going on here? I'm not gonna do anything. Why don't you just let me go? It's a little late, honey. We'll take the both of them. And remember, you two, look natural. If you fuck up, you're both dead. Go. Who the hell told you to bring them back here? Janet, you've got shit for brains! We couldn't help it, Johnny. We ran into her in the elevator and he's chained to the goddamn case. Why didn't you open it there? No way, take a look at it. - All right, all right. - What's wrong with you? People, are you crazy or something? Look Mouth, this isn't fun and games. For real, you understand? Yes, I understand. But you don't frighten me. Scum like you never have. Tie her up, I'll deal with you later. Now move, asshole. You will get caught. You realize that, don't you? Fuck off. That's just about the kind of language-- Look... Don't worry. I didn't shoot him. What are you going to do with us? I don't know. I hadn't planned on you. What do you think we ought to do with her, girls? Well, we could put an apple in her mouth and roast her. You can't get away with this, you know. Oh, now she's gonna give us a sermon. You don't scare easily, do you? Not by someone like you. You're just a bunch of cheap little crooks. - Ah, temper, temper, temper. - Take your hands off of me. You're a testy little bitch, aren't you? If I weren't so happy, I'd shove my gun up your ass. Well I do believe that's strawberry. Ginger, Janet, take asshole out in the back and tie him to the shack. You two keep an eye on Mouth. I'm gonna go call Charlie. Is Charlie there? Charlie! Guess what old Johnny's got. How many times I got to tell you, don't talk on the phone. Well Jesus, I haven't said anything yet. So when do you want to meet me? Well, Charlie, I got a small problem. What? What's the problem, you missed? No, no, no, no, no, we got what we went after. It's... Well, it's just that... The girls brought company with them. Company, what company? The fucking guard, they brought... Guard, hey, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear nothing. Yeah but you gotta... Nothing, I don't wanna hear nothing. Okay, okay. When do we meet? Sorry, can't. But I'm not even sure I know you. As for seeing me, forget it. I'm going out of town. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I just went through a lot for you. For me? Not for me, mister, I don't even know you. What am I supposed to do? I got diamonds and people up my ass. Take an Ex-Lax. Shit! Son of a bitch! He fucked me, the lousy creep! What's the matter, Johnny? That fucking fuck, he cooled it and ran, bitch. Well, we still have the jewels, don't we? They're no good without him, don't you understand? Why don't you spell it out for her? Shut up! Johnny, isn't there anybody else that can handle the jewels? Fucking Dee Dee. Leave me alone, will you, I got to think. Next thing his arms and legs will fall off. You've had it, mister. Now why don't you let us out of here while you still have a chance. Dee Dee, get Janet in here. What are you going to do? Dee Dee, do as I say, now! You know, Johnny, she has a pretty sexy body for such a straight chick. Yeah. Good piece of ass would straighten her out right fast. What's up? We're going to teach the lady a lesson. We're gonna have a party and guess who's gonna be the door prize? Oh, let us take care of this one, okay, Johnny? We'll have her head turned inside out before we're through. Be my guest. Save a little of the end for old Johnny. - Oh God. - Come on, move it. Hey, how you doing? I guess it's pretty tight, isn't it? Well I can't feel my fingers, if that's what you mean. I'm sorry, Archer. Oh, you mean, before they kill me? No, no one's going to kill you. I mean, my brother's not a murderer. Oh really? What's the other alternative? Listen, you're wrong and I don't want to hear any more. Let me ask you something. What are you doing with this gang? I belong here. Like hell. You stick out like a sore thumb. Shut up or I'll tape your mouth shut. I belong here and there are no murderers here. Okay, come on, move it. Okay, we told you we were gonna give you a party. What kind of party? Well, that's for you to find out. Leave me alone. Oh, don't you worry about a thing. Stop it! Oh, poor baby. Please leave me alone! Don't worry. That's your way of looking at it. You have taste. Stop it. Just relax. Don't worry about a thing, sweetheart. And just what do you plan on doing? Well, have you ever had a girl before? What's your way of looking at it? Get the rest of these clothes off. Yeah, get her a little more comfortable. Oh, speaking of comfortable. There you go. - There we are. Now we can get this old blouse out of here. Stop it! Oh, poor baby. Please leave me alone. Just relax. Don't worry about a thing, sweetheart. Oh, tiny feet, oh my. Just relax, honey. - You're disgusting. You're both... - Well if you'd relax, maybe you'd just enjoy it a little more. Let's see what color. You got some red down there too. We match! That's hard to do. Please leave me alone. Oh, just relax. Come on, try and enjoy it a little. Such a nice body. Oh yeah! Stop! Oh yeah! Stop, stop it! Why don't you get up here? Let her take care of you. No, no! No, no! Not bad for a beginner. Oh yeah! Who is it? It's me, Dee Dee. Come on in. - Oh sorry. - Oh no, that's all right. That's all right, what's up? Well, can I talk to you alone? Get out. - Johnny! - Now! What the hell time is it? Oh, it's about midnight. But I've just gotta talk to you. Well, let's get under the covers and we'll snuggle, like you used to do when you were a kid. What's the matter? Well, it's just that I don't like what's going on here. What's going on here? Well, this whole thing. I mean, the girls. What you all did to Miss Fibbs. Ah, she's nothing. None of them are. She's just one of those legions of squares that live and die with a dying cunt. You may not realize this, but she enjoyed what happened to her last night. Yeah, she really did. She dug it. And we didn't hurt her. She'll probably dream about that experience for the rest of her life. I don't know, Johnny. I just don't understand. Well, there's nothing to understand. She had something done to her that she's wanted to have done all her life. She just didn't have the guts to go out and do it on her own. She's one of those great cop-outs in the world. Well, what about the other girls? Where do they stand in this Johnny filled rating game? Ah, to hell with them. To hell with them? Johnny, you're in and out of bed making love to them. How can you say that? They're just cunts. Necessary evils, sweetheart. They don't mean anything to me, nothing. Oh, I don't know, Johnny. It's just that I didn't bargain on all this violence when I took up with you. I'm really afraid. Why? Well, that we'll get caught. Or worse than that. What could be worse than that? That you won't let the hostages go. Oh. Oh no, Johnny, you've got to listen to me. Or are you planning something else for them like you did to that man in the bar the other night? Oh come on, that was self-defense. Ginger had no other recourse. Your problem is you worry too much. Now why don't you go back into bed, get a good night's sleep, and stop agitating yourself, hmm? All right, Johnny. Send Ginger back in here. Hey, give me that pineapple, sweetie. Mystery meat again. No shit. Yeah, I'll have some of that too. Wait a minute, Dee Dee, I want you to hear this. Now listen. I think I got things figured out. Had a good sleep on it. Now, what do we got? Bunch of uncut diamonds, right? Maybe they're worth half a million dollars. So what do we do? Dump them and run, huh? That sounds like such a lot of waste of time, Johnny, for all we went through to get them. Right. Things would've gone on smoothly if Charlie hadn't gotten scared and run. But he did. So what do we do? We find ourselves another fence that deals. Who, Johnny? Who, how the hell do I know who? But I know where. Kansas City. Why Kansas City? 'Cause that's where Dee Dee and I grew up. I got a lot of friends back there. Not chicken asses like Charlie. They'll know what to do. Right now, we gotta take care of our two pieces of excess baggage. What are you going to do with them, Johnny? Now first, let's feed them some of this shit. Go ahead. I guess that's enough, huh? Yeah, I think so. Sherry, is Johnny going to release the hostages soon? I don't know, Dee Dee. Why don't you ask him? You know, that courier's kinda cute, isn't he? I haven't noticed. Hmm, I have. Love those big brown eyes. Hi. Do you like soup? Cat got your tongue? Sit up nice, open up like a little birdie. That's a good boy. When are you gonna let us go? You don't like our company? My hands are getting numb. Oh, are the cuffs too tight? Yeah, how 'bout loosening them a bit? Hmm, that wouldn't be nice. You call what you're doing nice? I didn't know feeding a man soup was a sin. How 'bout turning me loose, come on. You have the prettiest brown eyes. Look, look, you turn me loose. No one will ever know. Oh, Johnny would. Well to hell with him. Come on, let me go. I promise, I'll forget I ever saw you. There's no way you're ever gonna forget you saw me. Never, ever. Come on, baby, you and me. We'll make it outta here tonight, okay? Both of us. I can't do that. That wouldn't be nice. But I can make your stay here a little easier. Don't you think you're a bit overdressed for the event? You got some nice equipment there, Archer. Let's see if it'll rise to the occasion. What are you doing? What is this, another one of your games? Why'd you stop? The only game I'm playing is make sure I get some too. My hands. Your turn. Dee Dee, Johnny wants to know if everything's all right. Why shouldn't it be? He just wants somebody to keep looking in on the courier, just to be on the safe side. Oh, well Sherry's in there, so everything's okay. Okay. Hmm, she's been in there quite awhile. You're certainly not a very hospitable guest. Here I come in, I feed you, I give you the best ball you've ever had in your whole life. All you can think about is leaving. Get outta here. My, my, that certainly wasn't your attitude when I had that good looking teat of yours in my mouth, now was it? You men are all alike. Fuck 'em and forget 'em. Sherry. Dee Dee, how long have you... Long enough, now get out. Dee Dee, I was... All right, I'll leave. Good God, everybody's so uptight around here. I'm sorry, honestly. Well next time I get a visit from one of your friends, it's not gonna be that friendly. Listen, Dee Dee, when are you gonna wake up? I mean, really. Those bitches in there gotta draw you a picture? Look, I'll talk to my brother and it won't happen again. Dee Dee, please let me go. God, let me go! You know I can't do that. That woman and I are never gonna get out of here alive. Look, I don't want to hear about it. I said I'd talk to my brother. What else can I do? You could cut these tapes. Cut 'em, give me a chance. No, I can't and I won't. Now just leave me alone. Nothing will happen to you, I'll talk to my brother. You lousy little slut. If my brother ever finds out about this-- Oh Jesus, Dee Dee, you can't tell him. He'll kill me, you don't know him. I know him better than you do or any of you do, for that matter. Dee Dee, I think Johnny's starting to flip out. Ever since he got those diamonds and the fence ran out on him, he's been acting like a crazy man. Crazy enough to kill the hostages? Crazy enough to kill me too, Dee Dee. You can't tell him. Well, what about the hostages? You keep saying that. Well somebody's gotta think about releasing them before it's too late. Oh wow, forget it. Not little Sherry. Well listen, Sherry. I'll try and free Archer and you pick the woman and we'll make it look like it's an accident. They got away by themselves. Oh wow, I don't have a choice, do I? Uh-uh, not unless you want to explain the courier's handsome cock to my brother. Come on. I'm gonna take the tape off you now, so be quiet. What are you doing? I'm saving my ass. Now Johnny's car is parked out back. There's an extra set of keys over the visor. What about the other man? Hey, don't press your luck. Be happy with what you got, now get outta here. Which one of you cunts let her loose? Janet was with me all night, so it must've been one of you two. Don't look at me, I sleep in the room with Dee Dee. Ginger. Johnny, I... Johnny, please, Johnny, please! Johnny! Now, she would! What would've happened if that broad escaped? The man would've come down on us. That's right. And after what she did, we can never trust Sherry again. Now listen to me. Nobody's dumping me into the slammer. And that goes for you too, Ginger. You had no choice, Johnny. Fuck her. That's right. Now you and Janet take that body outside and bury her in the back. Sure. Baby. I had to do it. She would've shoved us right into the law. Well, it finally happened. Yes, it finally happened. I heard shots. What are you gonna do? I'm so scared, I don't know what to do. Untie me. I'm scared. If you don't untie me, you're gonna have my murder on your hands. I know, I know, but I just don't know what to do. For Christ's sake, untie me. I don't have the keys. Who's got it? Johnny. Well get it from him. Ginger, get out of here. What? Out! Haven't seen you do that since you were a kid. Yeah, well I'm not here to go into childhood memories. So what's your problem? What's my problem? Johnny, there's two dead girls out there, money from two holdups, and a hostage ready for the barbecue, and you ask me what's my problem? Oh Johnny, please don't kill anymore. I don't think I can stand it. Those two had to go, Dee Dee, you know that. The only thing that counts in this world is survival. You and me, little sister. Okay fine, then let Archer go and let's you and me get out of here. Oh please, Johnny, please? Oh, what the hell's he giving to the world? Well, what are you giving to the world? You got the hots for him? You're jealous. Jealous? Sure, I'm boning all those little chicks under your nose. Christ, you're jealous! You pathetic egomaniac. You better leave me alone, Johnny. How long is it you've wanted to go to bed with me, huh? Is it when you were a little girl and you used to crawl into bed and snuggle with me, huh? You're crazy. You know, I used to watch you undress when you were a little girl. Used to watch those little tits of yours get bigger and bigger. - Johnny. - They became eating size. And all the time, you wanted to make it with me. Johnny, I'm your sister! Get your hands off me! stop it! Start it, you mean. Why don't you stop this fake struggling, huh? Dee Dee! Oh Dee Dee, I've always wanted you. Oh, Johnny. Oh, Johnny. Oh, Johnny, I love that. That's fantastic. Johnny, I love that, Johnny. Oh, Johnny, Johnny. Johnny, I've wanted you for so long. For so long. Johnny, johnny! Are You! Jesus, are you all right? For once in my life, yes. The key, did you get it? - Uh-huh. - Oh God, thank God. Let's get outta here. What are you going to do? Let's go to the house. Let's get him. No, listen, you wouldn't stand a chance. They've all got guns. Maybe you're right. Enough killing. We'll let the police handle it. Oh the sooner, the better. Ginger, go get Dee Dee. Probably out in the shed. Johnny! Johnny, Archer's loose! I can't run anymore. Come on, we'll make it, it isn't far. No, I can't go, you 90- I'm not leaving you here, you know that. Look, he won't hurt me, I'm his sister. Sister, shit, do you forget what happened back there? Come on. All right, that's far enough. Now drop it, drop it. Dee Dee, get outta the way. Looks like you'll have to do it the hard way. Dee Dee, get outta the way! You bastard. I'll put a bullet through both of you! Sure you will. Johnny, stop killing! Dee Dee, for Christ's sake! Oh, Dee Dee. Oh, Dee Dee, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
