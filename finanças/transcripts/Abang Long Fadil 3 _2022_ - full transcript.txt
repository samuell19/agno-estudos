Boss. It's very difficult now. The new government does not take bribes anymore. It's very hard to run our business. All of our men are complaining. Am I right? Am I? That's right, boss. It's very hard to run our business these days. People are harassing us. For all we know, we will all go to prison. Our business will go bankrupt. Don't worry. You don't have to worry. That's not a problem. The reason I called... ...you all here... ...tonight... ...is to introduce... ...a new project. This project is called... ...Project 666. What is the project, boss? It's a top secret project. If everything is a secret, how are we supposed to know it? This project... ...if we can do it,... ...we will get to control this country. What's the project? Can you tell us please? You all don't have to worry about that. Let the boss handle everything. The most important thing right now is that... ...you all should tell me,... ...if you agree or not. That's all. Right. Do you agree or not? If you're doing it, I definitely agree. He said if I'm doing it, he definitely agrees. Let us eat now. If he agrees,... ...you agree, he agrees, all agree. Let us eat. I ordered this from Beijing. Chow Han's Headquarters. We are on level two. All clear. Stop! What are you doing here? I told you already, let me handle this. Chow Han is here. Relax. I've been a spy for 10 years. What's going on? Nothing. Go back to bed. Honey. Security! You two go and check what's causing the noise. Now. -Yes, boss. Hurry up. Alice! What are you doing in my room? Waiting for you, boss. Waiting for me? Security! You can all go back early today. Spend more time with your beloved family. No over time. Oh goodness. Come. Lie down here, boss. Lie down there? Sit down, sit down. I am lying down. I am me. Alice. Faster please. Okay, boss. Slow down a little. My eyes are popping out. Sorry, boss. Security! There's an intruder in my house! Security! -Yes, boss. Leave your wife and kids and come work for me! Hey, don't run away. Boss, I am scared. Don't be scared. If you're scared, I am scared too. Come, let's work first. Hei, who are you? Good morning, chief. -Good morning. Alice, what's up? I have some good news and some bad news. What's the good news? Now we know that Chow Han has a very suspicious... ...secret machine. What's the bad news? I think Jefri has betrayed us. A very serious allegation. While at Chow Han's house, Jefri managed to take one key. This morning when I asked him about it, he denied taking it. I am sure the key is with him, chief. A machine with a key? Alice, I want you to get a picture of the machine as soon as possible. Good morning, dad. Dad, I want to apologize... ...because I failed in yesterday's operation. Are you hiding anything from me? No, dad. Why? Do you have anything to tell me... ...about a key? Fadil. Sir. I wish you all the success out there. God willing, sir. I hope we will meet again. Meet again? You want to come back inside? No, sir. No, right? -No, sir. I know you have no friends. I have ordered a Grab car for you. Thank you, sir. -Good bye. Yes, sir. Who are you two? Sorry, Fadil. Nusantara Polis Headquarters. Inspector Shuib. We have a new case. A new case? Where is Inspector Wahab? Inspector Wahab is on leave. Inspector Wahab is not here. Inspector Shahab will take over this case. This is our suspect. Chow Han. He is involved in drug dealing,... ...and is suspected to be the highest leader of a gang. Even Wak Doyok knows him. Yes, but Inspector Shahab,... ...Wak Doyok is in prison now. Yes, that's right,... ...but... ...Fadil has been released. We have to find Fadil. Maybe he can help us like he did before. What is this place? Why am I here? Fadil, welcome to NSS. The National Secret Service. I don't have a car to be serviced. We are the government's secret body dealing with intelligence work... ...and important missions to ensure the national security. I am Chief Kazar, head of NSS. That is my daughter. My first born. Also known as my assistant, also known as the coffee maker. For your information,... ...we have a small team of seven people. Our current mission is... ...to get some information... ...on Project 666 which is headed by Chow Han. We have an intel that... ...this project of theirs will be a threat to national security. So we need your cooperation, Fadil. Why me? We have an agent whose face is exactly like yours... ...but he has defected to the wrong side. Same face? Same face like me? So I have a twin? My mother never said anything about me having a twin. Don't be ridiculous. At NSS we had plastic surgeries so we look like the public. It is to protect our identities... ...and also as a back-up plan... ...in case any of our agents defected. I used to look like that,... ...but for the nation,... ...I am willing to change my face to look like this. What's going on? Alice. This is Fadil. He will be replacing Jefri... ...to continue our mission. Why? I don't need Jefri or this guy to help me. I can do it alone. Sorry Alice. That's not for you to decide. Plus, you're not ready. Fadil, what do you say? No. No. I don't want to have anything to do with this. Please send me home right now. Jefri, you are very important in this project. Without you, this project will not succeed. Hi, honey. Who is this? This is Jefri. He's our new gang member. He is so handsome. Everyone likes you. Are these fruits for me? Of course... ...not. These are for our handsome boy. Our new partner. In conjunction of you being our new gang member. My heart is racing right now. So I want to feed you. My heart is racing too. It's okay. -I'd like my heart racing too. Yes, I'll feed you a new batch. What is the matter with you? Hungry. You are crazy! Such a nuisance. Please don't be like that. Boss, boss. Think of God, boss. Sorry. Be patient. Please don't fight, boss. I was singing. That was a song earlier. I love you, I love you. That song. -Yes, I know that song. Boss, listen. Please don't worry about the project. No matter what happens, I will help you,... ...and I will make sure that this project is a success. How did you know my girlfriend is here? Fadil. This car belongs to NSS. Equipped with a lot of high tech system like GPS and tracker. She just posted this one hour ago. This is the location. Isn't this Inst..... Sophisticated, right? So sophisticated. -Sophisticated. Yana! Yana. No, Yana. Don't! Why are you making noise here? Can't you see? We are shooting here. Silence please. This kid. -Sorry, Dato. That is my..... I am sorry, Dato. Go away. Go away. Don't be nosy. Go! I am going, Dato. -You're such a nuisance. You ruined my film. -Sorry, Dato. Okay, retake! Fadil! I am back. You again? Don't you understand me? I said I don't want to. I know you have nothing left. Help me in this mission. I promise you will be generously compensated. What do you mean? Fadil. I know your background. I know your life's history. Imagine this, Fadil. You marry your girlfriend. You have a house, a car, a happy family. Help me in this mission. I promise all your dreams will come true. NSS is an organisation with a huge reserve of funds. Who was that? I don't know. Oh, you can speak Hindi? -Sure, sure, sure. Jef, I have something to tell you. What is it, dad? -I know you have defected. Defected? I will never betray my own father, dad. Because you are my son, I know you have defected. So what are you going to do, dad? I have to imprison you. When? -Now! This is not fair. You have no proof, dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! Please. Wow! Nice. Oh, my shoes. A spy doesn't take off his shoes. Have you never watched those western movies? James Bond? -Yes. I watched the beginning, but never the ending. This house looks ordinary,... ...but it is actually extra ordinary. How do you mean? Oh, music. Is that enough? -Yes, it's enough. One more thing. -What is it? It's so dark. Help, help, help! This was Jefri's room. It is your room now, Fadil. All these are gadgets and tools you need as an NSS official agent. Most importantly is this suit. Every time you have a dangerous mission,... ...you are required to put on this suit... ...because it is bullet proof. Actually there are two suits,... ...but I am not sure where Jefri kept the other one. This chair. Be careful. You can sit on the chair,... ...but make sure there is no one on that bed. If there is, the person will be thrown out. Oh, before I forget. I have a question to ask, but it is rather sensitive. You promised to give me a house, a car and money. What about the contract? A contract? No need. Just trust me, okay. I am Malay, you are Malay. So we will use the Malay promise. The Malay promise? Wow! I believe in the Malay promise. Really. -Wow! Welcome to the NSS Lab. Please meet Professor Amirul. He is my younger brother. This is our senior professor, Professor Joey. How are you, prof? -I am fine. Why aren't you wearing any pants, professor? I have no time. To assist you in this mission,... ...you need many sophisticated gadgets. Yes. -Professor, can you show... ...our latest gadgets to Mr. Fadil please? Sure. -Please excuse me. Sure. We call this gadget the sleeping spray. If you spray this on anyone,... ...in three seconds, they will fall asleep... ...forever till doomsday. Ten minutes. Let's see the next gadget. We specially created these spectacles at N..... Where, professor? -N..... NSK. S. S. NSS. -NSS? Okay, professor. With the latest technology, we call these spectacles... ...X X Ray. What is the meaning? -Aziz M. Osman. Put them on. Look here. -Scanning. Don't worry. I have set it to PG13. Don't make me change to 18SX. -It's okay. No, professor. Shall we continue? I am sure you like this one. This is the NSS official car. It can start on its own, but there is a code. What's the code, professor? Emma, start your engine. How do you do, sir? Other than the ability to start and park itself,... ...it can change colours. Red. Green. You can even make some side income if you want. Grab. Isn't that cool? -So cool, professor. I think you are way cooler, professor. Thank you. Are you all ready for action tonight? Yes. Fadil is on the way to the location now. Excellent. Okay, remember. Your name is Jefri. There are some people here who knows you. So please refrain from talking, so you don't get caught. Let's go. -Okay. There are so many ministers here. They are having a fund raising for their political party. Oh, so how now? Let's go. What are we doing exactly? Okay, here's the plan. I will go to see Chow Han. At the time being, they don't know you're not Jefri. You go and find Ocy Lin. Ask her about Project 666. She may be able to tell you. But..... Fadil, can you hear me? Please put on the glasses. Otherwise we will not get the visual here. Scanning. A man. Scanning. -Fadil, what are you doing? Scanning. Scanning. A man. Hey, Jefri. You're so handsome. You are my forever handsome guy. You know what? You're the only one who can... ...make my heart race. Be patient, okay. You want your heart to race? Yes, of course. -With me? Yes. -Not here, people are watching. Let's sit over there. Come on, come on. Where are we going, Jefri? -Just follow me. I am so excited. You were checking if this place is safe? Yes, I hope so. I really like you. I am sure you want to do something forbidden with me. Yes, that's right. I like a Malay man. Really? -Yes. Good. You're not racist. Good. I like Chinese people too. This is the first time I met a dark Chinese like you. I am dark? -Dark is rare. You're beautiful. Beautiful? -Yes, very rare. Let's sit down here. I've ordered this table. You've prepared a table? -Yes. Oh, Jefri. You are so, so, so romantic. You know what? Later we'll go for a swim. I am a very good swimmer. I can teach you how to swim. You can swim like this. Then I'll teach you how to swim like this. Okay, wait. Then you can hold me, and I can hold you. Yes, hello? -Please sit right here. I have to see my friend. There. You see my friend? Who is that? -Please sit down here. That's my university friend. -You are so clever. Yes, I was a student at Universiti Nurhaliza. Let me see my friend first. My friend from the university. Hi. -Hi. What are you doing here? How long have you been out? You didn't tell me that you're out. Okay, actually what are you doing here? I am covering the news here. I am a journalist, remember? I thought you're an actress. -I am a celebrity, Fadil. I can be anything. Now tell me, what are you... ...doing here? You haven't called me... ...in five years. Now you're out of jail? Please talk softly. Okay, I am sorry. Actually I am ashamed with... ...myself. A person who is ashamed with himself will not know what to do. I am ashamed with myself. I am ashamed with you. Jefri! Who is that woman? -I think this place is haunted. I didn't hear anything. You just relax. I will explain it later. Jefri. Oh, Jefri. Since when is your name Jefri? Fadil! -I am sorry, Yana. What happened? It's nothing. Just a drunk woman. I thought she tried to commit suicide. The president will be delivering his speech soon. I am going to the toilet. Amirul, check the ballroom's CCTV. I would like to thank all of you who are here today. My special thanks goes out to Mr. Chow Han... ...because he has contributed the most to my party so far. Please give a round of applause to Mr. Chow Han. Yes, that's right. Even though he is the highest contributor,... ...that does not mean we will follow everything Chow Han wants. Isn't that right, Mr. Chow Han? That's up to you. This is your event. Mount Ledang, Mount Daik. That's where Hang Tuah went to be alone. In order to be a good friend,... ...you must listen to your friends. I wonder what was that? Look at you. -We are here. I'll take you to have fun. Madam, where are you taking me? -To have fun. I know that. Are we going into the room? Yes. Don't you trust me? Look at my performance. Hey, Maya. What do you want me to be? A spy or a male GRO? Fadil, you are in danger. Someone is following you. Go into room A123 now. Alice, what is it? -Your cover is blown, Fadil. Chow Han knows you're not Jefri. How did they know? I thought you are dead. -I am the third twin of... ...King Kong and Cobra. What is your name? -King Cobra. So much noise. She's sleeping next door. Why are you here? -I want to kill you. Who could that be? Fadil? Yana. You were with a different woman, now you're with another woman. What are you doing with this woman? I am not doing anything. Nothing. -Don't come in. Fadil, you better tell me what are you doing with this woman? Why is her dress all torn up? Actually..... -I am his girlfriend. Is this true, Fadil? That's right, Yana. She is my girlfriend. Go home now, Yana. I don't want to see your face. How could you, Fadil? Who is this woman? She is my girlfriend. I didn't expect you to be like this, Fadil. Such a useless man. I don't believe Fadil would do this to me. The Fadil I knew was a good man. Emma, start your engine. Chase them! Make sure you get him. Chase that satan! Devil! They are chasing us. Just speed up. Move, move, move. Hey, move aside! Don't honk! Don't honk! Faster. Go faster! -I am already at high speed. How much faster do you want me to go? They are shooting at us. -Relax. This car is bullet proof. Emma, destroy the enemy. Rocket launching in one, two, three. Emma, do it again. I want to see. I am out of rockets. -Then how now? -Hey! What are you doing? Let's go. What is going on? I was almost killed last night. How did Chow Han know that I am not Jefri? This must be an inside job. -Be patient, Fadil. Jef is still in prison. So he couldn't be the one... ...who blew your cover. -So who did this? When I was with Chow Han last night, he received a call. One of us here called him and blew Fadil's cover. What? Jefri is not Jefri? But who? -I wonder who? It couldn't have been me because I am the chief,... ...but I think that person is none other than... ...you, Maya. -Dad? You are so cunning. -What is all this, dad? I know it was you. -The other day you accused Jefri. Now me? Chief, chief. How did you know... ...Maya did all this? Fadil, you want a house and a car, don't you? Chief! Yes, it's her. Maya! You're a traitor! What? -Sorry, Maya. I have to arrest you. Ayah, please don't do this to me. Fadil, let me show your reward. Alice, you can't think that I have defected too. Alice! Dad! How do I poop in here? Wak, you have a visitor. No. Wak Doyok. -Yes. I need your help, Wak. -Why should I help you? I know you had dealings with Chow Han before. We received an info that Fadil was with Chow Han's wife. Now we want to know the connection between Fadil and Chow Han. Fadil? Oh, this I can help you with. Chow Han is the most sadistic head of gangsters. Fadil is working for him. If Chow Han asks Fadil to rob, Fadil will rob. If Chow Han asks Fadil to murder, he will go and murder. Fadil is very dangerous if he continues to be with Chow Han. Really? I didn't expect Fadil to be like this. Is this true, Wak? -It is true. Nothing is... ...truer than this. This is the truth. Inspector Shuib. We have to find Fadil. We have to arrest Fadil as soon as possible. Don't arrest him. -What should we do then, Wak? Just shoot him on sight. A lot of lives will be saved. Don't say I didn't help you. What do you want? -Yana, I can explain to you... ...about last night. -Stop it. Just admit that... ...you're a male GRO. I have lodged a report at... ...the religious office that you were fornicating with... ...two women at the same time. -Yana, please Yana. Can you hear me out first? Please don't be like this. How did you get my number? -I am a spy, Yana. I work with a government's secret service. You think I believe you? -It's okay if you don't believe me. Come to my house tonight, Yana. I'll show you all my gadgets. I'll share the location now. -Good bye, Fadil. Yana, please. Yana! Why the need to come to my house? Can't we talk at the HQ? Fadil, we have a problem. What is it? -I just found out myself. Actually... ...I... ...did... ...invent a very... ...dangerous machine. Only my father and I... ...knew about it. This is my latest invention. This is our test subject. This is the capsule injector. Star-jump! With this machine, we can control human beings.. Stop it now. Stop! Isn't it great, dad? Who told you to invent this stupid thing? Serves you right. Dad! That's how the story goes. Why do I need to know about this? Because I think... ...my father is working together... ...with Chow Han. Impossible. Why would your father hired me to be... ...Jefri? Why don't he just stopped... ...this mission? -I am sure Jefri has... ...a connection with the machine and we have to investigate that,... ...but for now we have to prove that chief has defected NSS. Are you out of your mind? His father promised to give me a house, a car and money. If I were to help you, all that will be gone. Please think about it, Fadil. If chief is a crook, you think he'll keep his promise to you? He can even arrest his own children. So what's the plan? Find the machine and destroy it. Let's go. -Wow! You can't. Why? Alice! Welcome back! Alice in Wonderland! How dare you come here? -Miss me, boss? Of course I miss you very much. You used to be my massage therapist. I've known for some time now. You are NSS spy, right? Then why didn't you kill me a long time ago? Because you gave me such good massages. You pressed here, wind came out of there. You pressed here, wind came out of the bottom. No matter where you pressed, I've never feel depressed. That's in short. There's nothing lengthy. King Cobra! We have a problem. Come out. Wow! So fast. -Where are you going to? I have arrived. Where are you going to? I have arrived. You are going to die. King Cobra. Hold on, it's just the opening. Wait a minute. I came here to talk to you, boss. I'm not looking for a fight. -Yes, let's talk. No killing. Killing is a sin. We'll go to hell. Let's talk, okay. I promise not to do it again. Straight to the point. What do you want, Alice? The knife is on your throat, you still want to make noise. Speak. -It doesn't take much. $10 million. Actually I am tired of being... ...an NSS agent, and I can help you. So tell me what you want, and tell me what you need. Wait. Amirul. I was slandered. Don't worry, Maya. We came here... ...to save you, but you must promise me. When I release you, you must fulfil your father's... ...promise to me. A house, a car, money and marriage. Yes, yes, yes. Please release me now. Let's go. What the..... This is a project for me to control this country. Control what? This is a mind control machine. A machine that is able to make anybody... ...listen to me. My plan is to control... ...the president of Nusantara Republic. Control the president, control the nation. Okay, what do we do now? What is this? -Maya! Amirul, you have always been a naive nerd. Dad didn't defect, but I did. Maya, I want you to destroy this machine. Yes, dad. Jefri almost blown my cover that night. So I had to stop him. I had to control his mind. Maya, you're such a traitor. Why? Dad used to worship Jefri. Now Jefri is under my control... ...and everything is going to change. I will lead and take over NSS. Interesting boss, but exactly how? Simple. Agent 001, Jefri, is the only person who has... ...has access and authority to be with the president... ...in a subtle and personal way. What happened here? Move! Move! Not you, Fadil. I am giving you one chance. There is one thing that you can do for me. I want you to kill Alice... ...and bring her body to me. Otherwise, a bad thing will happen to you. Move! This is how I will take over the whole country. Hey, Alice. Why do you keep applying that lipstick over and over again? Instead of getting prettier, you are looking very ugly. Boss! That is a camera, not a lipstick. A camera? Alice. Don't take me for a fool. No, I didn't. Where's the key? -She took it. She put it in her bag. How do you know? -I've been watching her... ...since just now. I've been watching her. She took it, and you just watched her? Now I am watching how stupid you are. Alice. Give me back the key. Kill her. Let go! A kick to the top. Allow me. -Please. My mahjong table. -It hurts, stupid. I have my hopes for you, but I can't depend on you. What are you talking about? She poked my eyes. Wait! Shoot! Hurry up, hurry up. This is all your fault. Yes, it is but we have to do something. What else can we do? Everything is ruined. I want a normal life. Get married and live like others... ...but because of you, a common man like me... ...have to deal with everything. Do you understand me? You know what? Maya injected something into me... ...and she can control me at any time now. What do you have to say? -For the time being, don't worry. The machine does not function without this key. Does this mean I am safe? -Yes, but we have to save... ...the chief and Amirul. Alice. I have checked the CCTV at Chow Han's house. He left the house. One more thing, I still... ...couldn't trace the chief and Amirul. Oh my God, I don't know why? I used the satellite, tracking devices, everything,... ...but I failed. Please update me when you can. Right, prof. Keep searching. I am going to take a shower. My boxers are in there. Who's there? -It's me. Yana. Yana? Yana, she is in the shower. Open this door. Fadil, are you inside or not? Fadil! Open this door, Fadil! Okay. Hi, Yana. What are you doing here? You sent me the location and asked me to come here, didn't you? Oh, can you come tomorrow? Why are you looking so scared? No, I am fine. -I insist to come in. I'm sure there's a woman. -Yana, there's no woman here. Where is the woman? There's no woman. It's true. You said you wanted to proof to me about your work. I am spy. Yes, there are lots of my spying gadgets in there. Really? Which room? -Don't go in there, Yana. Yana, I am hungry. Let's go out to eat. Why do you seem scared? -I am not scared, Yana. Not scared. Don't go into that room. There's no one in that room. There's no one in this room. Yana, please don't. Yes, there is not one in this room. I told you already. There is no one in this room. Yes, this is my room. You can look at my computer. These are my gadgets. You can look at them. See? I told you, didn't I? I am a spy, you didn't believe me. What was that sound? That's the secret agent's toilet. It will flush automatically every half an hour. It's as usual. After pooping, we want to shower. Automatic too? -Yes, automatic too. Let's not waste time. There are lots of other gadgets... ...I want to show you. Come, follow me. There is no one else in this house, Yana. I'm not lying to you. Okay, okay. You wait for a while. I have something to show you. Yes! Just watch my hands. Relax, don't be scared. Okay, look. One, two. Why do you look like you've just seen a ghost? What's behind me? -Oh, no, no. If I miss you, I will make that sound. Actually I miss you very much. Let's dance, Yana. You are so funny, Fadil. I like this song, Fadil. Whose necklace is this? I bought that necklace for you. Why does it look like a key? It's because I want to unlock your heart. Oh, so sweet. Let's just stop this please. Who is this now? You said there's no woman. Why are you doing this to me? Fadil, please explain to her. We have no time for this. I haven't clapped and it's already dark? Don't move! Don't try to do anything. Don't move! Hands up! Yana, please don't fight them. -Team Six, standby. Stop running. Arrest her! -Are you crazy? Yana! Sir, where is Yana? She is innocent, sir. Don't worry too much. She has been released. We just received the confirmation on your identity, Alice. Agent Alice, National Secret Service. We need your help. Thank you. Sorry, Mr. President. We had to use the underground. There may be a threat here. Agent Jefri will take care of you. -Very well. Okay, standby. Fadil. -Maya. I brought what you want. Please wait downstairs. Yana. Yana! Yana! What are you doing here? Go home, Yana. Yana, go home Yana. Go home. Hi, I am Yana from TVKL. I have a question for Mr. Chow Han. What is the event you are having tonight? Tonight's event is very special. We are having this opera event tonight especially for... ...Mr. President. Is this going to be on TV? Yes. -Mom and dad. Say hi to mom and dad. -Hello, mom and dad. How is everybody? Thank you very much to all that is here tonight... ...to watch our opera presentation... ...on this beautiful night. I have to speak Malay tonight... ...so Mr. President understands me. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. In a short while, you will be presented with... ...a unique opera presentation unlike anything else in the world. I like to quote Li Chang Wau from the Leng Dynasty. As much as the squirrel can jump,... ...the horse can jump better. That was a saying. I can't really break it. So without further a due,... ...please enjoy this presentation from the both of us,... ...Chow Han and Ocy Lin. Opera! Honey, please get ready. Standby. Oh, dear. Hey, honey. I've brought everything that you wanted. Good, Fadil. I didn't think you had it in you. Maybe we can work together after this. Chow Han will make sure you will be rich. Police! Don't move! You have been surrounded. Don't do anything and don't be cocky. Hands up! You are under arrest. -Got you! You're so rude, Fadil. Just a little bit. Rainy day, I've no money to buy bread. I want to borrow money, but my wife may not like it. I am as hungry as a starving cat. Luck should have it, we'll have nothing to eat today. I tried to save. I've given it my all. Dear wife, please don't be upset. Hi, Mr. President. Your drink. I am sorry, I am sorry. I didn't mean to. -Take me to the toilet. Bring us to Jefri. -Let's go. Go, go, go. Move, move. Agent 001. I'll be covering the President. The President has haemorrhoids. Hurry up and help him! Go, go, go. That is not Jefri. Fadil? Run, run. Where are you going? I have arrived. Don't try to fool me. You're so rude, you poked my eyes. You will die tonight! Let's go! Run. Run! Wait a minute! Bring my wife out. -Yes! Chow Han, let's go. Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! Madam, please hurry up. Run, run! You'll die! Police! Don't move! Split up! I've always wanted to try this. Move, move. Want to arrest me? You cannot! Hey! Stop! Settled! Stop! Don't try anything. What about my wife? Someone go and see. I think she has been arrested. Who is that? He's approaching us at high speed. That's Fadil! -Fadil? I am in a hurry. Hurry up, he's getting close. Hey, hurry up. I'll give you a bonus. Go faster. Lose him. Fadil! Where are you? -I am in high pursuit. Fadil, Yana is gone. I think she's been kidnapped. Hurry up! He is getting closer to us. Where is they hiding? Don't be scared. We must keep our mouths shut. They can't do anything. It's her. It's really her. Such a useless woman. She and her husband are the same. What are you saying? -Shut up! We have to focus now. Jefri has possibly injected our president with that implant. Even though they don't have this key, many things can happen. Alice! -How is it? Have you found them? I am in danger. Chow Han and gang are on the way. They are coming to NSS. I am sure they want to come in. What should I do now? Please help me. How now, boss? Who is that? YB. I am sure this is Chow Han's doing. We can't stay quiet anymore. We can't stay quiet. I will make a public announcement this afternoon. So the whole Nusantara knows that we are launching... ...a great war against Chow Han's gang. It has been proven that they are the bad guys. How dare he run a gang? It's not wrong to share, but running a gang is wrong. Why is he so envious? We just want to earn a living. Let's go. Alice! Fadil. Good luck! I am going invisible. Check all rooms. If you find anyone, just detain them. Jefri, stay in that room. You are our last line of defence. At exactly 12 o'clock, if anything goes wrong,... ...kill our enemy. Well, what do we have here? Alice and Fadil. Alice, I know you have they key. Come to NSS right now. Bring the key if you want the chief and Amirul alive. Fadil. Fadil! Don't you love your girlfriend? You're willing to watch her die? Don't touch her. Don't you try to touch her. I've touched her. There goes my ablution. Remember. Bring my wife as well. I am giving you one hour. Otherwise, I'll kill everyone. Mr. President! I will have a press conference on this matter today,... ...but there will be a bad implication. So I hope you can settle this as quickly as possible. Arrest Chow Han and his gang. I've instructed the Chief of Police to help your team as best he can. Good luck! It's okay. I will send the SWAT team to ambush... ...NSS. -No. We can't simply ambush the place just like that. They have hostages. My girlfriend is there too. What if my girlfriend is killed? We can't let Chow Han get away with this. He is involved in selling drugs. How many of our youths are ruined because of drugs? No matter what it is, we have to remember one thing. We have to reset the machine before we destroy it. Otherwise everyone who had been injected with the implant,... ...including our president will lose their memory. So what do we do now? I have an idea. We are here! We come with good intention. We are not bringing any weapons. Your boss' wife is here too. Honey! I really miss you. Wow! Your biceps are harder. You are little fatter. Thank you for making sure of her meals. Where is the key? Give it to me! Now let all the hostages go. Let them go? You think I have time for a headache? You all can go and die! Hey, Chow Han! You promised to trade this key with the hostage? Now what happened? This is what we call a broken promise. Where is Yana? She is safe. Don't worry. Yes, but all of you are not safe. This place has been surrounded. You think they can come inside the NSS? They cannot come in. I almost forgot. Hey, come here. Switch it on! Switch it on! Bingo! Bingo! Okay, don't be sad. Let's sing the Bingo song. B-I-N-G-O! B-I-N-G-O! B-I-N-G-O! His name is Bingo! Reset this machine now. B-I-N-G-O! His name is Bingo! Be happy! Be happy! Don't look so serious. We have succeeded. Hey, Maya! Why did you slap my wife? That is not your wife. You were pretty, now you look like dirt. What is this test now? The boss is in danger! Shoot him! Wait. Wait! Massage? Chase him! Where is he? What place is this? What just happened? Stop! No! Everybody must die! Hey! You die! You cannot die, or I will be in trouble. Hey, old man. Where are you going to? Chief! Chief! Hurry up. How many times do you want to disturb me? Wait right here. Don't go anywhere. The sleeping spray. Use it on Chow Han. What are you doing with me? I have nothing to do with all of this. Don't try to do anything. -We are the police! Move forward! Put the stick down. -Don't be stubborn. Stop! Put your hands up. You're in the wrong room. Jefri! Jef, my son. How are you? I thought we arrested him. -Yes, that's right. I am the forth twin of King Kong, Cobra and King Cobra. What is your name? King Kali Kong. How many twins do you have? My father is very fertile. I was instructed to kill everyone if... ...Chow Han's mission failed. -Your mind has been controlled. Wake up, Jef. I am your father. Ten minutes to twelve. At exactly 12 o'clock, your death will come. Yana. Yana, are you okay? King Kali Kong, you better surrender! He has a bomb! You are going to die! Oh, dear. Serves you right. My boss is in danger. I better kill you now. Coward. You use a gun. Fight me like a man. Come on, come on, come on. Ouch. Luckily you came, Alice. Otherwise this boy is gone. Put down your weapon, Jef. I had to do everything myself. Peace be upon you. Thank you all for coming. I have a very important announcement this afternoon. No one is reliable. I had to do it myself. The thing I am announcing today... ...is very important. You are under my instruction now. I would hereby announce... ...that $10,000 each will be given under... ...the assistance scheme. Mr. President, we have debts. What about the national debts? Mr. President, what about the national debts? I know, it's not a problem. We can apply for a loan. We can apply for a loan from the World Bank. It's not a problem. That's another fool. You are under my instruction too. Salute, little brother. Salute. I salute you, little brother. The Republic of Nusantara is under my instruction now. He has been possessed by the satan. What are you doing, satan? Take him away, take him away. Why? What happened? What happened just now? Ladies and gentlemen, please be patient and calm down. There's nothing to see. That was just a gimmick. How did I get here? Dad? What happened, dad? Welcome back, my son. Fadil, take this. The sleeping spray. Reset it now. Hurry up! Calm down. Let's fight first. Amirul, the password. Seven. Come on, talk to me. Baby, talk to me. Come on. Three. -Three! Talk to me, baby. Talk to me. Come on! We're going to die. Hurry up! Nine. The code, okay. Come on, you can do this. Five. Two. Nine. Zero. Five. One. Eight. Six. One. Sleep! Sleep, sleep, sleep. Sleep, sleep, sleep. One, two, three, go. Don't worry, Yana. Your parents are on their way here. Once they arrive, we will get married. Fadil. Jefri, what are you doing here? I come here to take this house back. That's impossible, Jefri. Your father gave me this house. Yes, my father promised you a house, but not this one. We have a special house for you. Low cost house. This is okay, right? Are you crazy? That's a flat. This house is not suitable for you, Fadil. I don't care. I insist on having this house. I told you already. That house will do. Go inside. You end up here, don't you? You two please do not fight here. Don't try anything funny. Yes, Mr. Short Whiskers. You are in here because of Fadil, aren't you? Dato Yusof's son likes to sing. He sings about winning and losing. This story does not end here. I am sure they will be a sequel, God willing. Am I right? -Right. A hump? -Right. You're exactly right. You lost your Javanese accent. -Yes, I lost it since... ...I'm friends with you. He is using bluetooth.
