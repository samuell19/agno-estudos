This is me. Yeah, really. I was so little. We were all little once, right? This tiny apartment is my home. When I was little, I never went out. So, naturally I was curious about the world. Very curious. Boss, there still no sign of the cat or necklace. He told me that out there was this great place. Where did you go? What happened to you? Blanket? CAT AND PEACHTOPIA After that... I never left home again. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, the city, what's it like? Cape, I told you many, many, many times about it. Out there it's chaotic. It's cold. And so full of crooks. It's not exactly what you think it is. But, I wanna go! I've never been outside. When you grew up my son, you will understand. This is such a nice home. We lack only the things we don't need. You should be content. Just like I am. I don't want to be like you. Huh? Blanket! Cape! Look! Meet your new pal! Come down here! She's a blue and gold macaw. Her perch is still downstairs. Hi, what's your name? Macaw. Yes, I know you're a macaw. But what's your name? I'm Mack. Mac, here's your perch. Come. Oh! I have your seeds and nuts. You're really named Mack? Yeah. Huh? But you're a female. Why is your name Mack? It's such a macho name. What can I do about it? This is my sixth home already. New home, new name. Who can possibly keep track of it all? In the end, I was supposed that 'Mack' was just easier for everyone. Have you been to lots of places? Of course, little buddy, of course. Although, I have a small character flaw. I can't resist... ...biting things. I'm a tad destructive. It's a tiny character flaw but humans can't seem to cope with it. You've been in so many homes, so... You've been outside too? Why are you so interested? Being home all day is boring. I see. Water! Water! If you're so scared of soda, I bet bath time must leave you a total wreck, huh, doesn't it? You! Hey, Fatty. It's rude to keep your door open while on a toilet... ...with a lady around. Understand? Aunt Mack? Outside? I don't know. I haven't been. Well, I have. You? A fat, lazy cat? A fat cat... ...who can barely fit into the toilet. You? So what's out there? Tell us! Tell us! Come on! Tell us! Peachtopia. Peachtopia? "A peach tree forest, along the stream..." That's right. I've been told by many cats about that legendary place. A real Peachtopia. It's a place for cats. You don't know about it? Five, six, seven, eight. ♪ Peachtopia is the place where all ♪ ♪ cats can [...] really all day long ♪ ♪ A place of milk, fish and fantasy. ♪ ♪ Where every cat can be very happy. ♪ ♪ Peachtopia ♪ ♪ Peachtopia ♪ ♪ Peachtopia is a world for you ♪ ♪ A paradise for all free cats ♪ ♪ A world for you which a dream come true ♪ ♪ Peachtopia ♪ ♪ Peachtopia ♪ Mama. You made that up, Fatty. I swear it's on that mountain. This glass beads leads directly to Peachtopia. This thing? You think I'm an idiot? A free land Peachtopia? If there's a cat Shakespeare, I'm a parrot Jane Austen. Something on your mind, Blanket? You once told me, that when you were little a stray cat came around here. Dad, he was from Peachtopia, right? Daddy, where did Mommy go? Could she be... ...in Peachtopia? Maybe... ...she's waiting over there by a peach tree. Daddy, I want to go out. Hey, what are you doing? Meow. Huh? I peed. You scared me! That was so reckless. Cape, cats aren't birds. Cats can't fly. Your mother, she... Well, she, uh... What about my Mom? Where is he? Your Mom, she... ...went to Peachtopia. Really? My mom went to Peachtopia? Hey! Let's go find her! It's too far away. We'll never make it. Why is that? Cape, cats aren't birds. Cats can't fly. Fly? One... ...two... ...three. Hey Cape. Let's say you do make it down. There's still the river to cross. Beware! At your home, in your cozy home, and in your cozy kitchen. There is danger! Take this! My goodness. That's so scary. So shocking. Who [...] about scares under our own roof. It's unbelievable. You see. You see. It's even dangerous at home, you guys. Come on! Build your warship! Cape, to be young is to struggle. But there's no point. Hey, Cape. What are you doing? Daddy, look, I made a rocket. I'm gonna fly it out of here. Cape, get down. Daddy, I'm going to Peachtopia! Look, watch me fly! Cape! Cape! He's really flying! Cape! He's falling! We have to save him. Cape! Cape! The red speck. I can't see it. Oh, Cape! - What's that? - Looks like a cat. Really? There's a cat on it! Daddy, daddy, look! I just photographed a paraglider. Uh, huh, I see. Come on, look again. Sure, sure. It flew and flew, flew and flew, all the way to here. Owh, great photo. She... she saw where cape landed. Hurry up! Quick! You can do it, Fatty! You're having a baby, or what, huh? Just do it! Come on! Push! That's it! Good. Head's out! Push! Hurry! Go on! Hey! Hey. Excuse me. Shh. Huh? Who are you? How did you get here? I actually, I want to go there, to the mountain, there... ...to Peachtopia. Peachtopia? Never heard of it. But it's dangerous here. Easy to get in, hard to get out! He got in by accident. Let him go. Run little cat! Ahh. Get down! Now! Huh? - Search over there. - Huh? Huh? Hey! Hey. Huh? There's cameras everywhere. Follow my footsteps. Over there! Get him! There! Over there! Quick! Quick! Hey boss, we checked the whole factory... ...and we locked up the ape. Just go now. All my work, my inspiration, even this workshop began with that bead. And after all this time, it's finally back! Lately, sales have been way, way down. That work, even old customers... ...dislike it. As you know, the market prefers the early... What's wrong with new work? What's wrong with it? What do they know, huh? Maybe, maybe because it's too complicated? What's that even mean? What do you mean too complicated? Which bit is too much? Tell me! Which bit? Tell me! You're the boss and you create the work. I'm the manager, I look after sales. The market's tough now. Sales are really bad. If nothing changes, this workshop... We'll look all over the place for that necklace. What now? How can we see that photo, huh? Daddy, look! The river's so wide! It's so pretty! Leave it to me. Let's see the paraglider photo. Paraglider? Okay. There. Huh? A parrot? Give it to me. Open your stupid beak. The photo! Don't worry. I saw it. I know where Cape landed! Know what? That's great. You're the best. Wow. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ What's your name? It's Cape. You're a little housecat. How did a little housecat land here... ...in this place of which there's no exit? I'm looking for Peachtopia! Peachtopia. Peachtopia. [...] Peachtopia! My daddy says is that [...] Peachtopia is really beautiful. So I made a rocket and... ...whew, flew here to find Peachtopia. A Rocket? My daddy says that Peachtopia is right here on this mountain. Why are you looking for Peachtopia? To find my mother. She left us. I really don't want to be lazy like my Daddy is, eating and sleeping entire day, just staring out the window! My dad say this'll take me to Peachtopia. Huh? The Raccoons are here. Begin searching! Right! The pawprints you cats make... are certainly much prettier than those of us raccoons. I'm off. If there's any news, get in touch. Fatty, get up! We were rescued by geese. How cool is that. We're in the belly of a huge boat. This is our home. The boat stops at new dock every day. We're nearly at the dock of the mountain right now. Thank you so much! Animals should help animals! The boat docks someplace new every day. You don't ever want to settle down? And what if...what if the crew discover you all here? If they do, we'll just go elsewhere. Everywhere is so crowded. We just occupy the corners. But we can't just hide, never going out. We would suffocate! Every day, we go some place different, So every day we discover a new place. Hey, I'm coming too! Huh? Daddy, come play with us, please. Sure, here I come. Thanks so much. If only my dad was as tough as you. That Peachtopia, does it really exist? Is it really here on the mountain? - It is. - Really? It's at the bottom of the lake. [...] Peachtopia, the valley of cats. There's a river lined with peach trees. In winter, the river freezes You can step on it easily and... ...you can glide really far distances. So far you begin to wonder, what's beyond the valley. What the world is like beyond Peachtopia. You've been to Peachtopia? You came from Peathtopia! That necklace, I gave it to your dad. You know my father? You gave him this necklace? He was just a kitten then... ...just like you are now. That's so great! If my father knew I met you he'd be so happy! Super! Peachtopia! Let's go there together! I can't go back to Peachtopia. But so what? Peachtopia is just a place. A place like any other. It's that lake? On the bottom? It's very deep, with undertows, dangerous. I'm not scared. That doesn't mean it's not dangerous. The cat your father knew thought... ...Peachtopia was small and the world was big. That cat, now he's just an old cat afraid to go home, one of a pack of lonely strays, passing the days in this dive. That necklace will bring you bad luck. Throw it away. Listen. Go up past the factory, that's where your son landed. Thank you! Come on, Mack. When you find your son, tell him, we all think he's really cool. Super Rocket Cat! Super cool! I have toys. Stuffed toys. Buying two get one free. On sale! Excuse me. Yeah. Take it to the second shop after the tunnel. Sure. It's freezing. Hang in there. - I'm a tropical bird. - Just hang in there. I have... I have to... Go ahead, spit it out. I, I need a toilet. Hold it in. Ooh, it's warm. I peed. It's pee! ♪ The promised land for all cats ♪ ♪ A paradise is just that ♪ ♪ The Happy Land that's Peachtopia ♪ ♪ A paradise no more than they had ♪ ♪ But where is it? ♪ I can't barely move. Hop on. Oh, Mack, I'm so stupid. I shouldn't have told Cape his mom went to Peachtopia. Well, when we see him, just tell the truth. Huh? Mack, look! We're nearly there. Wow! Wow. Hey, Fatty, hurry, hurry! What is this place? Shhh! Lower your voice. What's that? He's hanging in the air. He's levitating. Is he a god? Hence come you? Whither go you? He saw us! Loudmouth Macaw. Wow! You're amazing, a true master, a Master of the Way. Too kind, too kind. "Happy in nature, peaks short and tallest [...] Views ever-changing, lost amidst it all." Hey, Master. We're going to that mountain, but we're kind of lost. Can you tell us the way? Hahaha... You're lost. You're lost. Peachtopia is on the mountain. Peachtopia? What is Peachtopia? It's a metaphor. Peachtopia exists in our hearts. Only meditation leads us there. Hey, everybody. Brother Deer has advanced in the meditative arts. Too kind. Too kind. How's Brother Antelope's Magic Pill? Well, it has it ups and downs. Not easy. Owh, Sister Goat is here, too. Oh. Hello, gentlemen. So, how's the mystic calligraphy going for you, huh? I've had some minor breakthroughs, but Brother Deer is still our paragon. You flatter me. Our visitors are lost, and want to go to Back Mountain. Back Mountain? Oh, my, my, my. You mustn't go over there! Because it's your first time. And you don't [...] really know I'll tell you about the glass factory. It's very dangerous. It's full of nasty raccoons... ...who kidnap other animals! Yeah. Truth is, cities and people are everywhere now. For us animals, it's all dangerous. Only this cloth-dyeing plant is peaceful. So we live as hermits, meditating, pursuing enlightenment, and release from the human world... ...to the Nirvana of animal souls. Hey! Why don't you stay with us. We happen to need two disciples. You can receive our mystical secrets. True, true! I can see your potential. I appreciate your offer, but I have to find my son. If where he went is that dangerous, it's even more important that I find him. Family keeps you in the secular world. What about the lady? I'm interested! I'm interested! Owh, tell me your secrets. We'll find Cape, and then we'll come back. You are so powerful. You're so amazing. Teach me! Teach me! Teach me now! How dare you play such dirty tricks. No respect! No respect! Catch them! There's no escape. Look! The mountain! It's a trap! A trap! Go up! Go up! Come on! Huh? Huh? It's so late. Why call us back? Well. The boss says he's inspired, and to get ready. Hmm? Why is the aerostatic press on? Hey, underwater currents! What is this hose doing in the water? - Are they gone? - Shhh! Looks like it. Those must be the raccoons? Yeah. So dangerous! Huh, let's get out of here! The mountain's up ahead. Taste my Falling Leaf Kungfu! Stop it! This way. This way. This way. Go away! Hurry! Up here! Stop right there! That's my Power Kick! He isn't wearing the necklace. Where did it go? Huh? Could it be in the lake? Here's surveillance footage, from before he fell into the lake. When he came on to the property, he's not wearing the necklace. The boss is upstairs. How come you're here? It's you! What are you doing? Training. I want to jump out. You've no idea. On the last day of every month, he chooses one animal, to make a mold... ...for those terrifying sculptures of his. Alive! The boss says that... ...doing this gives the work its special spark. As for the animals here... Today. Today is the last day of the month. Ah. You... Ah! You're... Little Blanket, all grown up. Cape's been here? And they've taken him? I have to save him. There's electricity... Blanket! Blanket! Blanket! Blanket! Must... find Cape... Huh? The boss is coming. So, I guess today is the day for an new mold. What are you thinking, huh? Listen! I had the raccoons out on patrol. Look! They got lucky. They were able to catch some rare specimens. Untie them and chuck 'em in. Be quick. Look here. Look at this. The wild ones have great musculature. The long-termers get a bit withered. So tell me boss, which one inspires you? Oh, how's this one here? Or, uh, with this one? This? This? This? Him! Oh, but... What about the necklace? Any news of it? Oh, uh, still none. Still no news of it? Hmm. The necklace is lost just like... ...my inspiration is gone. I can't make anything, nothing sells. This factory is completely doomed. Since it's doomed, I want you to make me molds... ...from all of them. One by one until they're all dead. Cats! Cats are the worst. Start with him! Torment him to death. Then throw him in the kiln! Uh. Understood, you know in the past, if an artist was blocked, he would throw a live animal into the kiln. It was called a sacrifice. Actually, it's a shame to burn them in the kiln. Exactly! These four-legged creatures... ...who've run in the woods... ...make a great stew. It's true. They're so gamey. They make delicious soup. - What's wrong with you two? - He bumped me. I bumped into you? You must be blind. [...] I did it. We'll look for Cape in the morning. Blanket! Look! My mate. Later... We had kid. You can't imagine how tiny he was at first. And so adorably pink. With his closed eyes. He open his eyes and... ...he looked at me. My son. You're a dad, Blanket. And even later... I haven't been a good protector, but I have to protect him. I must find Cape. I'm going now! Cape? Cape! Huh? Cape! On your right! On your right! Hey! - Hey! - Huh? Look! There's a parrot. Auntie Mack! Hey, Cape. Your daddy and I are here to save you! Dad's here? Yes, your dad. He's the best! He jumped out the window, and followed you across the river. He fought cormorants and goats. And now he's here to save you. Of course, there's me too. Daddy! Huh? Just wait. We'll coming back to save you, and the others too! All of you! My Daddy? That grey cat is your father? We met that grey cat. He's your dad? He's a kungfu warrior! His skills are extraordinary! He's coming to save us? Your dad is formidable! My Dad! Wonderful! Wonderful! It's so wonderful. My dad is gonna save me! I'm getting out of here! The last time that I escaped. I waited until raccoons went on their meal break. I reached out, and grabbed that stiff, heavy lock. I pulled and pulled. I escaped! Take that, you stupid monkey. Now the lock's too far away. There's no way can I reach it. I have a way! Huh? Owh, oh. Tell us! What is it? Tell us! Hahaha. Aw! Aw, that hurts! Get ready! Almost there, guys. It's not strong enough. Huh? Support it, quick! - Someone's here! - Hurry. But I'm an idiot. You pull this one. Huh? You're playing with your feeders now, huh? Here's some plastic bags. Play with these. Did you find Cape? Yeah, I did. I found him. He's trap in a teeny tiny little cage. Oh, poor Cape. What's to think about? Let's go, already! - We... - Hey! Raccoons outside. Take it. I'm pretty smart too. But where could I go? Out there, is a very cruel and ruthless world. We raccoons, we get run over by car, get kicked or chased by kids. At best we raccoons end up in a cage at the zoo. A Cage. Worst case scenario, we land in a pot of raccoon soup. Terrifying. Terrifying. You are a smart raccoon, you know the truth. Hmmh. They say you cats only look after yourselves. Cats also mind their own business. Good How's this. You're no stranger. so I'm giving you a choice here, okay. You give up the cat and necklace, and nothing changes, okay. Or, You can, just hand over the necklace, but... ...that's the end of your precious little bar. Getting a choice does have its price. Now, I... ...I can set you free. And you leave this place with the grey cat. Which do you think I'll choose? Each option has its benefits and its price as well. It's not easy. No, it's not easy at all. Is this not the agony of choice? And the fun of it all, too? I overheard your conversation just now. I'll rescue Cape myself. What the raccoon said. It make sense. I heard what you said, too. I was just humoring him. I won't make things hard for you. You don't have to choose. Have the necklace. So, you're off to save Cape? Worst case, I fail and get caught. I'll be with him then. Let's go, Mack. Let's go! It's mold time. Move it. It's somewhere near here. C'mon, let's look over there. Daddy! Daddy! I'm over here. Hey! Daddy! Thet got dad! - Cape! - He in danger. He thinks I died! I have to get him! I have to tell him. I'm alive. You can't save him. - I have to save him. - Cape! Cape! - Let me go. - Your dad wants you to be safe. - You're all he has in this life. - No! No! I have to save my dad. We're going to Peachtopia to find Mom! Your mom isn't in Peachtopia. She's not in Peachtopia? Mama... There's only me? Your mom died long ago. Your dad told me. You're lying. Maybe we can use this. There's you, too. Biggie! Biggie! Look who's here. Hahah. But things have changed drastically. The fat cat is now in my hands, not in yours. I'll give your the necklace and I'll give you the kitten, too. You give me the grey cat. And let us leave this place. Oh oh. So the fat grey cat means a lot to you does he, huh? He saved my life. Hmm. Sounds reasonable but then... What if this is just a little dirty trick, huh? On your territory. We'll do the trade in your HQ. Hmm. Okay, you've got yourself a deal. You had to make a tough choice, but it still better than not making one at all. You did and I'm very happy. Actually, when you go, I'm gonna miss you. Hurry! Move it! Huh? - Daddy! - Huh? It's Cape. You're alive. Yes, Dad, I'm alive! Ah. Cape's alive. My son is alive! Cape's alive. He didn't die. He's alive! Let me go! Okay, let's do it. You take the grey cat, and I keep the kitten. You? Sorry. Now, let's go. No! Let my son go! Let my son go! Sorry. I change my mind a lot. I've thought it over. Not gonna happen. I have to take you hostage. You? Son! You're alive! Wonderful. So wonderful. Daddy! Kidnapping me is no use. Out there are men, walls, electric fences. You already know this is a place of no exit. I know that. We're in, not going out. Move. Cape? Little Cape. Blanket? Little Cape. What a hero. You save all of us. You're awesome, Cape! Huh? Blanket. - Hey, Cape. - Huh? What now? You still can't get out. Hmm. We're not leaving. Right. We're going all the way in... ...to Peachtopia! Look, Cape. I'm sorry. I never told you. Your mom isn't at Peachtopia. That's okay. Daddy. I already knew that. Everyone, come with me! Huh? - Everyone, do as I say! - Okay. First group! Second group! Third group! Hurry! Quick! Come on! What is going on? Huh? Grab them all! Now! Quick! Everyone inside. Daddy! Whoa. Daddy. Daddy, hurry! Oh no. It got stuck. Daddy, go, go! Go, go, daddy! Oh. Daddy! No! Daddy! Cape! Thank you so much. I wanted to quit ages ago. hahah. Ah. That necklace and the bead! It's okay. It's just an ordinary glass bead, just a souvenir. Huh? Originally, he gave it to me. When I met him, years ago, he was poor worker with big ideas. He said I inspired him. I inspired his first cat sculptures. The bead's lovely, mutating colors... ...were like the inspiration he chased. The workshop... ...was his Peachtopia. Later, he went too far, into the dark side. So, I left. Later, we both changed. Owh. And Peachtopia? Does it really exist? Look. It's there. Aah. Wow. Woo hoo. Full steam ahead. Turn right! Turn right! Dad! Daddy! Daddy! Wake up! Cape? Quick! Look! Everyone wake up! Daddy! Hurry! Wow. Wow. Weeeee Wow. Yeah. Wow. Ooh. Yeah. - You're free. - Yeah, hahaha. I want to go home. That flat across the river, that's my home. - Daddy? - Huh? How about I go back home with you. I know that not everyone has a home to go to. Hey, son. This giant world... ...is all yours. Go! Experience it, be daring. But if... If one day you miss home, You know that your home is wherever I am. Take care, take care my sweet little Cape. I'm going, too. My mother isn't here in Peachtopia Where will you go, then? Hmm. I don't know. Wherever I want to go. Somewhere. Bye, guys. What about us? This place doesn't suit me. Peachtopia isn't my home. No one knows me here or is waiting for me. It doesn't suit an old stray cat like me. Why is any place you can get to... ...never where you want to be? If you can't find home in your heart, you won't find it anywhere. Even still, this is a pretty good place to live. Set up a guardpost. Yeah, I can do that. Keep it from humans a while longer. I'll open another bar. You need a business partner? Daddy! Daddy! You only saw mom fall, right? Maybe she's still alive somewhere. Wherever I go, my mother might be there. I'm coming, Mom! I'm coming, big world! Since when I was little, I've dreamt of Peachtopia And here it is. But Peachtopia lives in every heart. It is such a special place, where you live happily. But... ...Cape is off to see the big world. I have a home. We all have to let go, leave, and grow up.
