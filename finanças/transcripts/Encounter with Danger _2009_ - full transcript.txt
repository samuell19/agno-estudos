Get the drives. Done. There's one missing. What are you talking about? It was supposed to be right here. Pack it up, let's go. So, sis, how was the big date? Miserable. There's got to be a decent guy out there. You know, I think you just need to give yourself some time, you know? I mean, not every single guy is like Troy. Frankly, I don't even know what you saw in the guy in the first place. Well, we can't all be as lucky as you and engaged to Mr. Wonderful. Yeah, now if he just didn't travel as much. Yeah, speaking of which, is he back yet? Any minute now, so I actually gotta go. I will talk to you later. Bye. Honey? Wow. What's the special occasion? Who said there has to be a special occasion? Wow... you look... Wow. Thank you. So, how did it go? Oh, you know how these year-end audits are. Shareholders want everything. I've got so much work to do. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. You're always working. And what happened to you? I sprained my ankle running down the stairs at corporate. It's nothing. You're wearing the new necklace I bought you. I thought that you would like it. I do. So listen, I have an idea. I was thinking that maybe this weekend, we could take a drive up the coast. Right. Well, you know, I mean, we have been engaged for six months and we have never gone anywhere. I have to leave in a couple days. What? Yeah, day after tomorrow. Okay, you know that you just got back, so... Where is it that you're going that is so important? Corporate. Got a meeting with the top brass. You are a freelance accounting consultant. What is it about them that makes you so nervous? Sweetheart, Cerulean is my biggest client, with a year-end audit looming. Trust me, if I could dodge it, I would. I know, it just seems like we never get to spend any time together anymore. Which is why... And, you know, you are always gone. Always gone. Laurie... It sort of feels as if I see you every two weeks, which... Honey, honey, honey. Which is why I want you to come with me. Really? Yeah. Look, the meeting'll take a day, tops. We can spend the rest of the week together at the resort. The week, huh? Uh-huh, check it out. Look at that. I already signed you up for the whole spa package, the facial, the salt rub, the massage, everything. Hmm? What do you think? I mean, I think it sounds amazing, and I would love to go. I just have to see if I can get the time off work. Get the time off work? Are you serious? The university loves you, you've got tenure. Of course they'll give you the time off. Hmm... Hmm? Come on, come on. Okay, I'll go. Look at this place, it is so cute. Yeah, nice and peaceful. I thought you'd like it. And you promise no work? No work aftertoday, I promise. There you go, sir. Thanks. Thanks, yeah, my pleasure, enjoy your day. Wow, this place is beautiful. Isn't it great? It's got eight tennis courts, indoor-outdoor pool, it's got lots of hiking, it's got a championship golf course. What? Oh, you don't like it. Yeah, I hate it. Oh, I'm gonna be late for my meeting. Already? We just got here. Yeah, I promised him I'd be there by 1:00. Okay. You gonna be okay? I have checked into a hotel before. Listen, I don't wanna lose this, okay? Okay, and remember, for the rest of the week, you're mine. Oh, yeah. I love you. I love you, too. See you before dinner. Okay. Don't forget, deliver the schedule to be here later on this afternoon... Hi. Hi, may I help you, ma'am? Yes, I have reservations. Okay, name? It should be under Jack Anderson. Jack Anderson. There we go, and your name? Laurie Parker. Oh, I see we have you scheduled later on this afternoon for a spa treatment. Yeah. Here are your keys. Thank you. Enjoy. ... the market rally today based on the higher-than- expected yearly earnings of software giant Advanced Cerulean Technologies. Cerulean CEO Elliott Maine was recently named one of "Forbes Magazine's" richest men in America. Will there be anything else? Um, yeah. Is there a romantic restaurant that you would recommend? Most guests prefer the Fireside Room. It's right here in the hotel. Okay, thanks. Well, hello again, Ms. Parker. Hi, can you tell me where the spa is? Yeah, straight up the stairs and on your right. Also, can I get a reservation for two at 8:00 in the Fireside Room? Good choice. Consider it done. Thank you. Ms. Parker? Yes. Welcome to Pine Mountain Spa, Ms. Parker. I see you signed up for a full package. I did. First time here? Yes. A lot of women come up here to clear their heads and just relax. No, I didn't come here alone, I came here with my fiancé. He's an accountant, he had a meeting. Advanced Cerulean Technologies? Yeah, how did you know? They're everywhere up here. I'd say most of the folks in this town are either married to or dating a Cerulean employee. Let's get you started. Hi, you've reached Jack. I can't come to the phone at the moment. Please leave a message at the tone. Hey, honey, it's me. The spa was amazing, thank you so much. I made dinner reservations for 8:00, so I hope that's okay. See you soon, bye. Room service. Hi, you can set it right there. Here you go, thank you. You've reached Advanced Cerulean Technologies. Our offices are now closed... Hi, you've reached Jack. I can't come to the phone at the moment. Please leave a message at the tone. Hey, it's me. I thought that you were gonna be back in time for dinner. Can you... can you call and let me know what's going on? Thanks. Hi, this is Laurie Parker in room 507. Can you cancel my dinner reservations, please? Thank you. Hi, this is Laurie in room 507. Are there any messages for... No? Okay, thank you. Hi, you've reached Jack. I can't come to the phone at the moment. Please leave a message at the tone. I'm sorry, but the user's voice mail is full. Please try your call again later. Hello? Hey, stranger. Oh, hi, Carrie. "Oh, hi, Carrie"? Is that any way to greet your sister? I'm sorry, I just thought that you might be Jack. Oh, you're not in the throes of passion. Yeah, I was hoping. Why, where is he? Office, he had a meeting. A little late, isn't it? Yeah, I know. Did you call down to the front desk? Yeah, no one's seen him. Maybe they went out for drinks. Remember Troy used to go out and close a big deal and come home stinking of scotch? Yeah, you're probably right. Yeah, I'm sure he's fine, just relax. Call me tomorrow? Will do. Okay, bye. Bye. Excuse me. Thank you. Hi, can I please speak with the manager? My name is Mr. Ullman, can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for my fiancé. Fiancé? Yes, Jack Anderson. I just need to know if anybody has seen him. Is he a guest here? Yeah, we're staying here together, room 507. We don't appear to have any guests with that name. No, the reservation's under his name. He booked the room. Well, the only name we have in the system for that room is Laurie Parker. That's me. Well, you're the one who checked in. Yes, but he's the one who made the reservation. Look, if I could just talk to the gentleman that was here yesterday... Gramby. Yeah. He's off for a couple of days. Is it possible your fiancé went to visit someone? Perhaps you have other friends in town. No. Well, if you had a photo of your fiancé, maybe I could show that around. I have one on my cell phone. Right. Well, this is my e-mail, and if you would like to send it to me, I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, would you like me to call his office and check to see if he's there for you? No, actually, I think I'll just go there myself. Where can I rent a car? Oh... You will find these people very helpful, Ms. Parker. Great, thank you. Thank you. Hi, I'm looking for... Yes, no problem, I'll transfer you over. Thank you. Can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for Jack Anderson. Okay. No, he doesn't work here. He's an accounting consultant from LA. He came here yesterday for a meeting. Let me see what I can do. Thanks. Hi, I have a woman here looking for a consultant named Jack Anderson from the LA office. You're wearing the necklace I bought you. He came for a meeting... yesterday? Yes, yesterday. Okay, just a second. Really, okay. Well, I'll let her know, thank you. Did they see him? Actually, they said that nobody with that name came by. I don't believe this. You might wanna check with Human Resources. Maybe they could look him up. All right, where is that? Actually, just go to the top of the stairs on your right. So she says to me she doesn't think we have any chemistry. Uh, yeah, we talked for maybe 20 minutes, and she's already decided it's not gonna work. Look, I'm gonna have to call you back. Excuse me. Hi. You can sit wherever you want. As soon as the secretary comes back, just sign in... No, I'm looking for someone. My fiancé, Jack Anderson, he came here yesterday for a meeting, and he hasn't been back to the hotel since. Is he an employee of the company? A contractor. I was just wondering if maybe you could tell me who he met with or where they went? You said he's your fiancé? Yeah. Yeah, see, the thing is, all our records are confidential. Now, maybe if you were actually married, I could... Look, I'm 1,000 miles away from home. He left yesterday, he hasn't been back, he hasn't called, he's not answering his cell phone. I mean, please, all I want is to know where he is. All right, I'll check it out. What's the name again? Jack Anderson. No, there's no one in the database with that name. Okay, can you check again? I did, he's not in the computer. Okay, are you sure that you're looking for Jack Ander... Yes, yes, there's no one with the name Anderson with a contract in any of our California offices. No, he's a consultant. He's not actually an employee of the company. Okay, look. Did he happen to mention who he was meeting with? All he said was the top brass. Look, what is your name? Todd. Todd, I have been to his office. I went to the Christmas party last year at the Four Seasons. All right, if you don't believe me, just pick up the phone and call Bob Martinez, he's the head of the department. Okay, I'll call Bob. Hi, it's Todd Carter in HR, but headquarters. Can I speak to Bob Martinez, please? Oh, he is? Vacation, huh? Hmm, ooh, Alaskan cruise. Nice, nice. Do you know when he'll be back? Ouch, yeah, listen. You wouldn't happen to know a Jack Anderson, would you? He's an outside consultant. Okay, okay, thanks. I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say. Ugh, please. Look, Miss... Miss... Laurie. Laurie. I promise I'll make some phone calls. I'll look around, but if he's missing, maybe you oughta call the police. Whatever. Look, here, give me your number. If there's anything, I'll give you a call. 310-555-0765, thank you. 0765... Excuse me, who is that man? Mr. Ryan. He's head of security for Cerulean. There was a break-in a few nights ago. Everyone's a little on edge. Thanks. Hi, you've reached Jack. I can't come to the phone at the moment. Please leave a message at the tone. Hold, please. Ms. Parker, any luck locating your fiancé? Thank you for holding. Well, there's no sign of tampering. Door hasn't been forced. What time did you say you got back here? 9:30. 9:30. And how many room keys do you have? Just the two. And did your fiancé have a key? No, he left before I checked in. Mr. Ullman, how many card keys do you usually have for a room? Aside from the two we imprint upon checking in, there is one master at the front desk and one with maintenance at housekeeping. And all are accounted for, yeah? As far as I know. Sheriff, you're not suggesting it was someone with the resort? No, I'm just saying that assuming there even was a break-in, it appears to have been someone who had a card key. Ms. Parker, I assure you that the safety of our guests is this hotel's top priority. The safety of your guests? Unfortunately, it's not an isolated incident. Nice hotel like this, tourists come in carrying large amounts of cash, traveler's checks. Wait, you're not suggesting that this was a coincidence? Bags were stolen. Yeah, hisbags. Ma'am, I have two cops in this town, and as much as I'd love to drop everything and go searching for your missing fiancé, I just don't have the manpower. Something has happened to him, all right? Once he got into that taxi... I'll put in a call to the cab company and see if they have a record of anyone leaving the hotel and going to the office, all right? What about the office? And I will also call Cerulean. Who is his contact up here? I don't know. Well, he hasn't been missing that long. Typically, someone's gotta be missing for at least 24 hours before I can even begin to launch an investigation. But I think there's something else you should consider. What's that? Well, is it a possibility that there might be another woman? What? Guy on vacation. Spends long hours with his coworkers. Goes out for a couple of drinks, gets a little comfortable. That is ridiculous. My fiancé is not cheating on me. Does he work a lot? Come home late often? Look, all I'm saying is that you should at least consider all the possibilities. Now, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. When my deputy gets back, I'll have him come over here and dust for prints, all right? And in the meantime, perhaps you would accept our offer of another room. Our compliments, of course. I think that covers everything. Everything's covered? That is the extent of your investigation? To just accuse my fiancé of cheating on me? Just consider what I said, okay? Now, I'm sure your fiancé will show up, but in the meantime, I'll leave you in the capable hands of Mr. Ullman. Thank you. So, Ms. Parker, how about that room? Hi. Hey. I haven't heard from you... did he come home yet? No. Really? Did you call the police? Yeah, but they weren't much help. Let me ask you something. When Troy was cheating on you... Don't remind me. Wait, do you think he's with another woman? Just tell me how you knew. I don't know. He started working late a lot, more than he needed to. He was taking random, spontaneous business trips, stuff like that, but I just can't imagine Jack doing something like that. Neither could I. Well, listen, you know him better than I do. Do you trust him? I'll be right up. I gotta go. Mmm... I thought you were gonna wait. Open up, I know you're in there. What do you want? Um... Sorry, my mistake. I've seen you before. I doubt that, I'm really sorry. Hi, this is Laurie Parker. There's something wrong with my account. It's 4-5-6-9-2-1-3-4- 8-2-7-9-0-0-4-1. What do you mean there's no account? I just pulled money out of it yesterday. No, Parker. P-A-R-K-E-R. That's impossible. Never mind. Hi, excuse me. Hey... hey, wait! What the hell are you doing? Didn't you hear me? No. Okay, do you remember me? No, should I? You picked my fiancé and I up at the airport and you took us to the Pine Mountain resort? Sorry, I think you got the wrong guy. No, don't you remember? We went in and he came back out and got a ride with you to his office. Sorry. Okay, I saw him get into your cab. Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about. How can you not remember? It was just yesterday. Ma'am, I have never seen you before, okay? What are you doing? Look, I think you got me confused with somebody else. What did you do to him? If you just call the main dispatch... I don't want to call the main dispatch. All right, I wanna know what you did to my fiancé. I didn't do anything to your fiancé, okay? What... what are you doing? I'm not doing anything, I'm driving a cab. Billy, Ms. Parker, is there a problem? Sheriff, this woman will not leave me alone. This is the driver that picked up Jack. No, I told her I've never seen her before. Ms. Parker, I put in a call to the cab company, and they have no record of your fiancé. He's lying. No, I'm not lying... Just calm down. Look, he picked Jack and I up at the airport. He dropped me off at the resort, and then he took Jack to his meeting. Is this true, Billy? No, Sheriff, that's not true. Look, all I know is that I'm dropping my fare off, right. He gets out, all of a sudden, this lady comes up, screaming, shouting, jumps in front of my car, and then she starts yelling about her fiancé. And you didn't give him a ride? Never. Again, he is lying. I'm not lying. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sheriff, am I good here? Yeah, off you go. Thank you. All right, what are you doing? I told you I was short-staffed. My fiancé is missing. Someone broke into our hotel room, stole his things, our account is closed, his company has no record of him, and I think somebody's following me. Like I said, I'm sending a deputy over to dust for prints, so please, give it time, okay? I've got a friend over at the Bureau. He put in a call to Cerulean, and they said they've never heard of him. They're wrong. Well, that may or may not be true, but I can't help you if you're running around harassing people. Am I making myself clear? Fine. Just let me handle it. Sure. Ms. Parker. Sheriff, you startled me. Still trying to do this yourself? Well, I'm not just gonna sit in my hotel room and do nothing. Besides, you said that you were understaffed, so I figured that this would help. Well, just as long as you leave the police work to us, huh? You have a good night. Hey... hey! Hey, wait, I wanna talk! Hello? Laurie Parker? Yes? I have to apologize for running off on you like that earlier this evening. I had to get out of there... they're watching. Who, me? Both of us. You must have sensed by now that you're being watched. They're not that clever. But they'll go to any length to make sure you and I don't talk. Why? Because I know where your fiancé is. Who is this? I'd rather not be that specific on the phone. I'll meet you. Fine, when and where? West Ferry Terminal down on River Road. Tomorrow, noon. Come alone. Wait, I need to ask you something. Is he okay? Can you just... Hello? Who are you and what do you want? My name's David Abbot. I work with your fiancé, I'm an accounting consultant. I know what happened to him. We were working on a project together. We found something, something we should never have seen, and now... now he's in terrible danger. I'm listening. The people who have him will stop at nothing to make sure that... Somebody call 9-1-1! You're the one who brought him in? Is he okay? Well, right now, he's in a coma. We didn't find any identification on him or anything at all. What do you know about him? His name is David Abbot. Friends, family? He worked with my fiancé. Well, maybe we could speak to him, then. He's not available at the moment. I see. Well, if you could give us a call. No, I really need to speak to Mr. Abbot. Do you have any idea when he'll wake up? That's difficult to say. Could be days, possibly weeks. It is possible he'll never wake up at all. Excuse me. You gotta be careful out on these roads. There was a car following me. Really? It ran me off the road. What kind of car was it? I didn't get a good look at it. What about the plates? The driver? Is there anything you can tell me about this car? I wasn't really taking mental notes, okay? I'm sorry. Where were you tonight, Ms. Parker? You don't believe me. There was an incident reported earlier today at the ferry terminal. Man was hit by a car, picked up and taken to the hospital by a Good Samaritan that matched your description. My fiancé is missing and you're questioning me? Is there anything you wanna tell me about him? He needed help. Why is it that anytime something happens in this town, it seems like you're involved? All I wanna do is find my fiancé. And I told you I would look, but if you continue to make trouble for me in my town, I'm gonna have no choice but to take you in, am I clear? Are we done? Yeah. Enjoying the new room, Ms. Parker? Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, I was just thinking about you. What's the latest? You find Jack? No, and I don't think he's having an affair. Wait, he's still missing? Yeah, I'm really getting worried. What do the police say? The police aren't saying anything. I mean, the sheriff doesn't seem to believe a word that I say. Personally, I think he's in on it. Whoa, in on it? Yeah, I don't really know who to trust. I mean, I checked with the company, and they said they have no record of him working for them. That's ridiculous. You don't think they have anything to do with it? I don't know, but I need you to do me a favor. Anything. Right, well, Jack keeps copies of his invoices on his home computer, I need to see them. Do you still have a key? Yeah, yeah, I'll call you when I get there. Great, thanks. What information, Jack? Is there anyone else living here? No. Look at all this. How long has he been collecting all this? Long enough, Mr. Gaitan. What if he wakes up? He could talk. Don't worry about Abbot. Let's just get this stuff and get out of here. And Anderson? I'm telling you, keeping him alive is risky. We'll take care of him, but not until we find everything he's got. Check it out. Sis, what is it? There you are, I've been calling. Well, what's the matter? Someone broke into your house. What? The door was busted open. I'm so sorry, the whole place is torn apart. Someone was looking for something. Cops are on their way. No, no cops. Why? I don't know who we can trust right now. Laurie, you're not sounding rational. They're already on their way. All right, we have to hurry. Go to his office. All right. Is his computer still there? Yes. Great, turn it on. Okay, hold on. Got it. I want you to look for a folder named "Jack's clients." Okay, hold on. Got it. All right, look for another folder that's named "Cerulean." Do you see it? Mm-hmm. Okay, there should be another one that is labeled "invoices." No, there's nothing here. Look under anything with the name "Abbot." I'm telling you, this folder's completely empty. That's impossible. I mean, Jack keeps everything organized in that folder. There's nothing here! Laurie, I'm starting to get scared. What is going on here? Look, just get out of there, go home, and do not talk to anyone. But the police are coming. Don't talk to anyone, you got it? Okay Yes, if you just head right down this hall and take a right at the end of the corridor, it'll be your first door on your left. Have a good day. You know what? I'm gonna do that tomorrow. Okay, bye. Oh, I sprained my ankle running down the stairs at corporate. Something is not right here. Hey, you, hold it! Hello. Hey, you're back. What are you doing? I'm not here. What? Please. Can I help you? Did anyone come in here? I'm looking for a woman. Sleight build, medium height, brown hair, gray suit. Did you see her? No, no, no, I didn't, but you know what? If you see her, why don't you give her my number? What's going on? Come on. What, are we going somewhere? Is there a back door? Yeah, over there. Do you have a car? In the parking... I will explain everything to you once we get in your car, let's go. "We"? Please. All right, let's go. Wait, wait, wait, I gotta get... One sec. I can't believe this. Wait! What did you do? I'll explain later, let's just go. Oh, man, they're all over. Okay, look, wait a minute. Look, here's what we're gonna do. Take my car, you run ahead. Get in my car, it's the black one, four stalls up. No, wait, what? Look, come on, I'll be right there. Go. Great, just great. What was that all about? What? I saw you talking to him. Are you kidding me? Yeah, I told him I saw you inside. To throw him off the scent. You wanna get out of here or not? Well? You're gonna have to trust me. What are you doing? You wanted help getting out, we're out. Now speak. My fiancé. The one that was missing. He's an accounting consultant for the company. I think he found something in their books, something that they're trying to cover up. Okay... But wait a minute. Are you suggesting that Advanced Cerulean Technologies, one of the biggest software developers in the world, has something to do with your fiancé's disappearance? I know that it sounds crazy. No, it sounds insane is what it sounds like. Who else could have changed the employment records, the hotel reservations, our bank accounts? They've completely erased his life. But why? What could possibly be so important? I'm not sure, but I found some hidden files on the accounting server. I think Cerulean might be broke. Broke? That's impossible. I mean, their shares just shot up after they released their new operating system. What if they faked those numbers? What if their earnings report is a lie? What? How could they do that? What if that's what Jack figured out and they're so anxious to cover up? You know what? The break-in. From a few nights ago? Everyone was saying there's... There's a bunch of files missing. Hard drives and archives. I bet it was an inside job. Oh, my God. I mean, if this ever got out, it would... It would destroy the company. So what do we do now? We go to the cops? What do you mean, "we"? You wanted help, didn't you? You can't do this alone. I mean, if what you're saying is true, you're gonna need my help. Hey, hello, you listening? He didn't have it on him. What? That's why he's alive. That's why they haven't killed him. They thought that he would have the evidence in his bag, but he didn't. How do you know that? Because they stole it and he's still alive. Okay, see, but how do you even... You know what? Never mind. I don't wanna know. We need to find it. Yes, we do... wait, find what? The evidence. We need to take the company down ourselves. Wait. What now? The camera case. He told me to hold onto it. Said that it was really important. Maybe it's just an expensive camera. Well, he never really seemed to care before. I wonder... Wait. Okay, it's up. Let's see what we got here. Is that what I think it is? That's why they want him so bad. How did he get it? Well, he's an accounting consultant for them, so he has access to their systems. So what do we do with it? Take it to the Securities and Exchange Commission? All right, there's a regional office in Seattle. We could be there in an hour. Do you need to get that? No, I'll call them back later. We should get going. You know, you don't have to come. No, no, no, you involved me. And if you're gonna bankrupt my pension, I wanna be a part of it. Besides, the district manager's a friend of my cousin's. Then that's where we're headed. I'll just give him a call, let him know we're coming. Where'd you say you got this? My fiancé's a consultant. And he's missing? Yes, and I believe this report holds the key. You know, Todd, as your friend, I have to make sure you realize what this will do to the company. I don't care, I just want my fiancé back. I know the risks. But we can't allow them to get away with this. This isn't gonna be easy, or fast. There's gonna be internal investigations, probes, hearings. Besides, Elliott Maine is a very clever man. He has connections. There's some very influential people that'll come down on this, hard. Look, I know, I know. Please, we really need your help. I'll tell you what, I'll make a phone call. I'm not making any promises here, but I'll see what I can do, okay? Thank you. Thank you. I'll be right back. I think we got 'em. We have to go now. What? Go, go, go! Get in there! Hurry! Stop! Stop! Get us out of here. I'm trying, I'm trying! "Oh, sure, he's a friend of my cousin." You think I knew that was gonna happen? Maybe. Hey, you came to me, remember? Who called you earlier? What? In the parking lot, you were talking to the guard, and before we went to the SEC, you got a phone call. Who was it? Oh, my God. You think I have something to do with this, don't you? You're unbelievable. That was my ex, all right? She's a little overbearing. All right, why don't you call her if you don't believe me? That's okay, I'm sorry. What do we do now? We do what Jack did. Which is what? Call the top brass. I asked not to be disturbed. I'm sorry, I didn't get that message. Who is this? I believe you know my fiancé, Jack Anderson? Where did you get this number? I figured it was only fair, being that you seem to know everything about me. That would depend on who's talking. Cut the crap. Okay. What can I do for you? It's not about me. It's about what you're looking for and how you're gonna get it. I'm listening. I have something that belongs to you. You have something that belongs to me. I suggest a fair trade. Mm-hmm, that simple, huh? Well, it's either that or I turn this document over to my friends at "The Wall Street Journal." I think you'd prefer my way. Even if I was willing to discuss a deal, how do I know that you have anything that could possibly interest me? You can call your friend, Matt Gordon, at the SEC. I'm sure he'll vouch for its authenticity. Okay, listen, I'm not in the office right now, but I could be there in about... one hour. No, someplace else, someplace neutral. Where, then? Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m., Ferry Terminal. And if I see anybody but you and Jack, you are done. That's it, now we wait. Are you sure you know what you're doing? It's the only way for me to get Jack back. What... you're just gonna hand it over to him? What's to keep him from just throwing you both overboard once they have what they want? I may not be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, but I am smart. Are you all right? Yeah, I'll be fine, I'll be fine. Do you want me to go with you? No, we made a deal, and I said alone. As long as you're sure. Sure as I can be. Do you know what to do? I'm ready. Okay, let's do it. Laurie! Are you hurt? No. Ms. Parker. I prefer to conduct my business negotiations in private. And here we are, in private. I must admit, you're a lot stronger than I anticipated. I can see what you see in her. Now, give it to me. Where is it? Let him go. Give me the documents first. No, don't do it, Laurie. Now, how do I know that's the only copy? It's not. In fact, I set up a mass e-mail to go out automatically in one hour to all the major news channels, unless I deactivate it. When are you gonna give up the charade? The truth always comes out. The truth is whatever I say it is. As long as the value keeps rising, the board will do anything that I say. Anything. And Jack and I aren't a liability to your plan? There's a certain degree of trust in every business relationship, Ms.Parker. Even your fiancé could tell you that. Don't trust him, Laurie. He'll say and do anything to save his neck. It's okay, as long as you're safe, I don't care about his SEC violations or his precious golden parachute. You have no idea how precious that parachute is. Or how far I'm willing to go to protect it. What's he doing here? You were supposed to come alone. I never go into a business deal without hedging my bets, Ms. Parker, now hand it over. Can he swim? Stop! Let me remind you... You remind me? You are nothing! You're a schoolteacher! You think you can threaten me with a little e-mail? The people who work for me practically invented the Internet. Do you see how easy it was? Pay off a taxi driver, change an HR file, a hotel record or two, and no one even knows that he existed. So go ahead. E-mail the Associated Press, for all I care. I can guarantee you it will never be read. If you're so powerful, why are we here? Why is this so important? Are we negotiating now? Yes. Name your terms. We leave here unharmed. You get this back, I cancel the e-mail, we never see you or one of your employees ever again. I can agree to that. Now hand it over. Take them. I was so worried about you. I'm so sorry, honey. I had no idea they'd take it this far. Thank you. Satisfied? Yes, except for one little detail. As you said, you are a liability. Mr. Ryan? Jack, run! Go, go, go! Todd, now! Get out of the way! Who's that? A friend. Go, go, go! Oh, some friend. Todd! I'm sorry. I've worked too hard at the company to throw it all away. Get them out of here. Uh, about our agreements here? I'm not impressed, Carter. Two days, you were with her. If you'd have done your job and retrieved those documents like you'd been told, none of this would be necessary. Assist Mr. Ryan in their disappearance and I'll think about it. Todd, don't do this. Get in the van. People deserve to know the truth. We make our own truth... get in the van. Let's go. What do you think this is? We'll get there. Hey! Hey, don't let them get away! Go, go! No, leave it! Just leave it! Come on, come on! This way, come on! Go, go! It's Laurie Parker. We're almost there. Careful. We're here, this way... go, go! All right, drop your weapons! Put your hands above your head! Now! What the hell is this? Ma'am, the FBI would like to thank you for what you did. It was very brave. I don't know what this is about, but when my lawyers get finished with your department and this town, you'll be lucky to get a job guarding a local shopping mall. Did you get all of that? You've just violated a half-dozen privacy laws. Will somebody please get this jerk out of my face? I'll have your badge! I hope you can forgive me for not taking your claims as seriously as I should have. What's gonna happen to him? Well, he'll be charged, of course. Maybe the FBI can get him to testify against his boss. People like Elliott Maine need to pay for their crimes. That tape you made will be invaluable to the prosecution. Once again, I can't thank you enough for what you've done. Turns out it was Gaitan and Ryan who broke into their own company. Level of deception was off the charts. That was just the beginning. A company like this will leave a wake of corruption a mile long. Yeah, while you're at it, you might wanna check out the SEC. Now, I know it's been a long day, so how about we get you two a ride back to the hotel, huh? This way. Sounds good. No, it's going great. So you guys are good? Yeah... well, he doesn't travel nearly as much as he used to, and he makes it home on time for dinner almost every single night. Most important thing is, do you trust him? Yeah, I definitely trust him. Hey, the news is on, hang on a second. Former Advanced Cerulean Technologies CEO Elliott Maine was found guilty today on one count of kidnapping, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of conspiracy to commit murder, and 18 counts of... All right, I'm gonna go. Okay, but I'm gonna see you next week? Uh, yeah, we will definitely be there. I love you. I love you, too. Jurors told reporters that the most incriminating evidence came from the two whistle-blowers, former freelance consultants Jack Anderson and David Abbot. In other news, it looks as though the weather is taking... Honey? Honey? Hey. Did you hear the news? Elliott Maine was found guilty. Yes, I heard. I can't wait to see his face when he's sentenced. You know, they mentioned you on the news. Really? Yeah, you and David. The jurors gave you guys credit for the verdict. Oh, that's great, it'll help the new company. David's on the verge of signing a couple of new clients down in La Jolla. It could be a big break for us. Right, so no business tonight. Remember? You promised. All right, no business. But before I forget, David wants us over. He wants to thank you for all the help you gave him after the accident. Okay, we can talk about that later. But for now, why don't you just give your wife a kiss? You know, baby, now that the trial's over, I could take some time off and we could take a drive down the coast like you always wanted. Or we could just stay here and you could serve me breakfast in bed every day. Or we could stay here and I could serve you breakfast in bed every day. I think that is the one that we should go with. I think you're right. Yeah. Did I tell you how much I love these silk jammies?
