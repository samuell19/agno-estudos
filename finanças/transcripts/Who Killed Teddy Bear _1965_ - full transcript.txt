They told me he'd done that after she was dead. If 1 could only believe that. Well they never found him, at least no one who ever admitted to it. - I'm sorry. - So I could tell you anything you wanna know about perverts and degenerates. I've gone 10 steps beyond any psychiatrist. I've catalogued the condition of their teeth and the type of soap they use when they shave and it's paid off, believe me it's paid off good.

I couldn't make out what he said. - It's alright we have the tape. Look I wanna speak frankly, believe me I don't wanna frighten you. There was a case in Utah about six months ago, a similar pattern. I'm afraid he's not gonna be satisfied with the telephone anymore. - Whatever you say. - Well tomorrow see if you can get someone to stay with you. At least a week to make sure. - Well what happens tonight? - The easiest would be my place. - Easy for who? - You said you were tired. - You know, there's somethings a girl prefers to pick out herself.

Silk dresses and big fruity hats right? - Right. - Sure I knew that. - Then why'd you make them pick me up for stockings? - Because I thought maybe you'd changed your diet. Yeah it's a big joke to you right? Well who do we hurt with our special likes? - Where do you think we got your address? In the phone book? Do you remember Wood Haven? - Oh well, millions of women in the city why do you suppose we choose this one and not that one? Because we can tell that's why. Like a cat or a dog, we can tell. - Shut up Adler. - These broads are looking for it. But they gotta blame somebody right? Gotta yell rape. Rape! Rape! Rape! That way they stay clean right? That way they get it and they stay clean. - Put'em on ice. - Dave, this belongs to homicide not us. - So we save them the trouble. Go on hook 'em. - On what charge? - New York penal law, article 16 section 197. - Davy I can't do that. - No dangerous animal permitted to roam the city streets. - I guess you know they've been sending weekly sheets on you downtown. - Yeah I heard. - Can't you see? That junk you got in your apartment, did it help you in anyway? Or did it just help a 10 year old kid talk like a vice squad detective?

I used to have to travel up and down to New York everyday and started off by taking acting lessons... And then at the first audition I went to they said do you sing? So then I started taking singing lessons and then another audition they said oh that's fine but do you dance? The guys said to me oh we like everything you do but you're just not the right type. Lawrence? Hey you haven't listened to a word I've been saying to you. Come on let's go swim huh? {water splashing) - I'll help Miss Nielsen with the dishes. - Good girl. L oughta slug you.

Especially about me. - Look I don't give a damn what happens to you. - Yeah, I know. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well how'd he sound as if he knew you? In a strange sort of a way, he was familiar. Did he use your name? The words threw me and beyond that I can't remember. - Night Sam. - Business as usual tonight. - Better than usual. - L guess we're gonna have to look for some other jobs. Oh Nora. - Hmm? - Would you like a cigarette? - No, no thank you. Are you gonna go back to teaching dance? - No thanks.

Don't think I haven't noticed you and Michelle. - Maybe him, not me, no. - Oh, well now there's nothing wrong with it, I mean 'm not putting it down. Don't think I haven't envied those sleek young blonds. - Oh no, no you're too busy. I mean, well you don't get a chance to see them. The way they move, all the time the way they're moving if's... It's very suggestive. - Well so's walking if you think of it. - But have you seen their faces? No they're cold and they're without any emotion at all. - Oh come now, what do you suppose you look like when you're dancing? What goes through your mind? {laughs) - No, I don't dance I told you that. No, no I don't dance, not like that. - Give me your coat.

One, two, one, two. There you go. Miss Nielsen can I have a glass of water? - Miss Nielsen? Called once but hung up right away. He hung up? Why did he hang up? Because, 1 think he thought I was somebody else. Did he continue to use foul language in the second phone call? - Look daddy I can see you in the mirror. To be very nice so I would listen to him. You're a widow Mrs. Goran. I mean do you go with anyone in particular? Do you have a boyfriend? No. (clicks} - Dumb, dumb, dumb. Miss Nielsen, wait til I come back. (suspenseful music} Wait a minute.
