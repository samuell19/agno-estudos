So I'm try to tear her out of her father. I became her friend. Her friend, the neighborhood drug dealer, Darnell. But I did something I shouldn't have done. Sold her drugs and got her addicted. And anyway her and her friends came after me, and I was trying to be the big man on top. So came up with a plan, kill the pimp, framed them, and it was all going good until it backfire. I got shot, went to jail. So then her mom, they left town. Me, I tried to make amends with her sister, but she wasn't happy, so it is what it is. As long as they gone they'll be all right. Yeah.
