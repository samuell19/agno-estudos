Told is what actually was. Told by whom, who actually existed. And who still stayed amongst us when deceasing. Where are you? Katja? Where are you? I had a dream Which was more than just a dream The bright sun was extinguished and the stars wandering, eclipsing in eternal space. The people forgot their passions in the dread of their abandonment and all hearts hardened to a selfish prayer of light Look Do you want something to drink Welcome The menu please Have Fun Have Fun Thank you It has been many years ago and yet I still think back to those days... that meant simultaneously the beginning and end of my being. I mean you I am out What? Prop up both arms sights in line no wiggling Your turn Bianca, he continues on his own. Come Your fate, your fate for a few pennies Cuba Libre, please Happy here? And one sparkling wine, please, ok? Brauth, and? Melanie Solitude has many names Bianca and Melanie, ok? Well, then here is to Bianca Let's go Not everything is as simple as shooting cans In a moment it may occur, never thought of in life Come on, come on Hello hello Good evening, Brauth. Hello Cindy One Vodka Tonic, she takes a Cuba Libre, and she.. an orange juice What's it for you? Also Cuba Libre? Get back in After you My life had changed or, less my life rather did my sensation. I felt a kind of inner emptiness nothing which I could imagine was, I though, in a position to fill this void. Candlelight Orange juice? Vodka Tonic Thanks Cuba Libre Thanks Enjoy Here's to you I knew it would soon be the time. We'll have to urgently convince one of them of her gender. A gap is going to be made again. Soon ... we would be back in that place, at which everything had happened, and of which I knew it would mean fulfilment and destiny to me. What's going on it seems to me like I was already familiar with this area oh that's a great sight it was in this unholy book in our library You amaze me with your knowledge It surely plays a trick on the brain < / i> But look at the horizon What a sight it is... I's got to be a mirage Such peculiar shapes they are guys like you, I not ??? Apparently, it is saying that this area is not made for us humans and if it is true afer all? What then? the shapes vanish a strange wind Do you hear the moans, do you hear it, too? Scary Stop! Do you think that it is the mirage of a real existing place It's all weird. What a spawn of insanity though I had a faint premonition of what we would find < /i> Afterwards, life wasn't the same anymore for all of us the constant fear was a part of our lives Let go. Give it to me There are two guests, going in and out as long as you live in this house, They are called love and pain you shall well receive them both Top right, please all the way right Bedtime now for all, come a surly ass lets off no happy fart again a night came down on the ancient eternal earth again became a darkness in the agony filled dungeon abyss. This morning I preferred the solitude and silence to my new company I enjoyed the atmosphere of the beginning day Now I was back here where everything seemed so familiar to me and yet it was all different changed by the insight of that, what was to come. Will he come? Rested pleasantly, I hope Life is, to bear confidence in the heart during battle and storms to never waver in hope, to never quail in pain. Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to the meal? Again and again, we imagine the vision of Empedocles, of a golden age when it was considered the greatest outrage to rob lives and to devour noble limbs I'd be happy to be allowed to enter I come with company. I knew you longed for it. thanks beautiful foundlings, I gathered here for you. Clarissa up here carefully girl our friend Heinrich, a lovely and a great artist for the pretty girl here's to confidence and then I realized I was going to forget my worries and fears and gradually feel a tense excitement about what was to come. always thinking about depopulation plans. Silence Peace Time escapes us Never is my cock so stiff, the heart so hard, as after an ample meal. Friends of drunkenness of gourmandism of horniness and cruelty. Amen. Hey, I, we know nothing about you and that...Katze. and who is she in the back there? plays absolutely no role nobody is interesting in us we don't care about the others nobody will miss us we are not there at all this is true also for you fuck you I mean, what do you do in life, do you have plans?

Alright, we know you do good, love everybody have wonderful plans for a cozy future and believe in a life in divine paradise. You did organise your life well... when are you having the poor brats? There is no life after this life. I hope so that'd be just what I needed. She doesn't like them, men and yet she depends on them an accident? Can she do not take a shit? I have to cut sometimes. but rarely Please more Sunday usually is for our inspiration. About this area, many strange things are reported. There are confusing myths and legends. We ot many disreputable spirited places here. ghosts sleepers Forest spirits are terrorizing Sometimes a three-legged hare is seen at the Devil's Hole. The headless horseman and the Wild Bunch, people here still believe in them. Don't get too close to the Steelmill Devil. and keep you away from the Fog Hole. Beware of the little fiery gold miner, roaming the slopes of this mountain. What's that sweet smell on this area? Not far away, there's a site for carcass disposal. Any animal carcasses from the surrounding cities are burned here. That's the acrid smell that smoke lays across the country. There are not many people here. This factory is the largest employer in the area Most men work there during the week. Weekends they work in the fields. There are simple people, Maybe a little ignorant raw. You want out *there* now? We want to a place where we were before, whenever we asked for quiet reflection. I'm going to have fun alone I'll see you tonight suit yourself If you find your way back this time of year it is dark quickly then it is not advisable... We are on our way! But *she* stays here! It's late what? It's late Here I've got all I need. if you must go... then go what is wrong with him? He is unlike us and he has not much time left. once again I could not understand Brauth. and I knew that, at the bottom of his heart, he could never really grasp me, too. it was the volatility in his being his action, which already at that time had led to the fact that our paths, at least temporarily, separated. My path however was imperturbable. Once a child, now a woman. is he there? Was it bad? Yes, it was bad but not as bad as then stay back Let oh world, oh let me be Do not tempt with gifts of love Let this heart have its delight, his pain, alone. What I mourn, I do not know It is unknown pains always there through tear,s I see the sun light sweet often, I am scarcely aware the pure joy curbs through severity thus oppressing me in my chest deliberately. Something hurt? Stay back Let oh world, oh let me be Do not tempt with gifts of love let this heart alone have its delight and its pain why so hesitant? Enter the temple of lust The Lord is my Shepherd ...for His name's sake. even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for Thou art with me In the face my life the house of the Lord keep my soul not in there no! Years have passed The morning came and went came back... ... and brought no day are you afraid of death? At the edge of the forest, in long afternoons, I can lie in the grass, listening to the bird. The valley seems to leisurely cradle in full harmony quietude of its plaint. it endorses me, and my worst plague, to submit to ugly faces of society here it will finally not battle me, where I am at ease myself and if the fine folks only thought just how poets beautifully waste their time to me, they would at last... What's going on out there Never got out of the city, did you? Brauth and me, we have already spent here many years. a strange atmosphere in the area, but we became one with it. it's time to go to sleep sleeping sweetly, cutie. I have a headache Shut up, you cunt What to do, if your helper needs help himself? fantasies are inspired, carnal desires excited half alive, she feels godforsaken Pain does claim the soul much more than does delight but the soul ascends to a higher level Heinrich such beautiful words you have just said of the soul and such I think I already like you very much Heinrich The philosophy of the people, my dear child does not serve to console the weak. It has the sole purpose of bringing justice to the spirit and to eradicate any prejudice. stay well-behaved, girl. I love you all very much. you love the beauty He behaves philosophically, just to fool the people It is the garment of falsehood one needs only the mantle of virtue, not virtue itself and with this falsehood, the way for new dirty deeds is open it will bring good luck to you a greeting from your friend Heinrich dear Heinrich is our problem child for long one of the island of the blessed He himself will be his final work of art. Heinrich is a good man his last deed, a good one Take this I have to go to the toilet Shut up Eat. Take that, take it! Come, come eat. Eat this now! Come on, come on. Come Please! Damn it, shut up! Please. Damn In a country where a cripple has more rights than a proper man... and you do not feel well yourself? Forgive me for just now come Heinrich? My girl Do not worry. The Apocalypse offers a spectacular play the dead I've heard the dead voice the voice of the dead a child Bianca, wait here I'll have a look. What was it? A rabbit a rabbit? Go back to sleep Then, I felt... if I existed alone, as the world consisted only in my imagination, as if nothing were, except myself. I... I were the eternally damned, Satan Alone... ...with my tantalizing imaginations, Alone... ...with my demanding imaginations. I'm cold Your kiss is poisonous like the bite of a spider. You have never been in love? May the gods protect me from such plagues. Is there a worse slavery on earth? I go wherever I want, and stay where I like it. ...and what about Katze? Do you know each other for long time? Long time Pain does claim his soul much more than does delight That's what Heinrich has got. Although Katze is capable of all debauchery of the mind, pure his heart did remain. and Heinrich? We've already had that, right? Heinrich is happy the Afterlife is for him the paradise a long past state, brilliantly he can retain Well, nothing more to say Doesn't he get along in life? His life is art! I am so hot Pull up your skirt Spread your legs very slowly These will be the last hours in which I can be with you. Are the heinrich's pictures on the wall? His extreme art has never gained recognition. Now it's too late for him. My body is alone no nerves no heart, no brain, no blood no chest, no stomach, no gut, no cunt. My whole body is rotten Just skin and bones of the unorganised body remain with me. no soul, no God, no devil, no existence nothing exists around me I 'm completely alone. Of no natural death will I be dying. sentenced to eternal life, a terrible punishment the eternally wandering ust my excrement give me a feeling of security and unspeakable warmth Afterwards, life wasn't the same anymore for all of us For a part of our lives bringing back the daylight which could mean the end of the world I don't want to conceal from you what indescribable things we have seen in these mountains. This mountain of madness. Like before, I noticed that ominous effect which this area and this house had on us. take my kitten come come on ok, and now you. Melanie, beware! so you can also enjoy all this. Melanie , run! to the door Melanie! Melanie! Get up come Don't go in there, Melanie. Melanie We need to get out of here. Do come, please Melanie wake up What do I care about what somebody defies, what he despises, what he has done. He is human, and therefore weak He is the criminal, and therefore unhappy I feel sorry for him. Katze? Katze! Return from an eternity I experienced a loneliness such as it couldn't be larger completely separated from the rest of humanity time streched space expanded A distrust towards all worldly things, also toward men, occured Cursed was I, to stride through ruthless vastness affected by a holy severity a deep solemnity moved me an excess of beauty I spoke with the stars unimaginable bliss Darkness demonic shadows reach for me I'll never get rid of these feelings go put it in. Look, Snow White finds all this disgusting. Then puke, go on and puke! Stick your shitty finger down your throat come on, come damn it, puke then just like that, puke! Puke He is not a bad person I felt that I had gone too far inmy debate with Heinrich. On the other hand, thought of it as a good sign finally escaping the years of lethargy, through the awakening of my temperament at least one last time Are you with the spirit? Rejoice in hope, amen. You are astonished, girl, aren't you? As simple as that Soon I will be a part of your life, little girl Soon I will be an integral part of your biography in importance only behind your parents... who brought life to her. Run, girl! use the headstart three-and-a-half minutes And I felt the hopelessness had given way to a serenity. Sserenity... which allowed me to do things... that still had to be done. All evanescent is but a parable. The inadequate, here it's happening. The indescribable... here it's done. The eternal feminine... pulls us down. Brauth? Please don't peaceful We take him to the monastery If the individual who wants to dissolve, will be dead... the elements, of which it is composed,... will still have their place in the universe... and will still be useful to the large machine, as before... when they still composed the said being. Down, down, down, down I fall down, down, down, down I fall down, and arise I never shall. Whether this person is alive or dead, nothing changes in the universe and nothing gets lost. Psychological counseling We dedicate this artistic rework to the victims of the events - as far as known to us - as well as to Katja I., and her nameless child.
