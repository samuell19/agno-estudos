In our everyday life, everything we encounter has clear and unambiguous space and time coordinates. Our experience of time as linear and space as three-dimensional is mandatory and convincing. Therefore we quickly come to the conclusion that, the characteristics of time and space are indispensable and absolute. Let's describe the process of creation as a movement from the undifferentiated unit to diversity. ... and the space as three-dimensional, our experience of time as linear Let's describe the process of creation as a movement from the undifferentiated unit to diversity. Then our conditioning will most likely tempt us, Then our conditioning will most likely tempt us, to imagine that this process began at a certain point in time, Let's describe the process of creation as a movement from the Let's describe the process of creation as a movement from the undifferentiated unit to diversity. Then our conditioning will most likely tempt us, to imagine that this process began at a certain point in time and unfolds in linear time. But already in the Tibetan Book of the Dead the Dharmakaya is described, the clear primordial light. Hey. the clear primordial light Did you order something? No, I didn't actually. It says your name on it. With hot regards. I don't know, I'll have a look at it later. Want me to help you unpack? I'll manage.

See you later. It is the same with creation. On this level the past, present and future exist side by side, instead of following one another, and consequently all stages occur simultaneously. Done? Yes, all I've gotta do now is add the time-lapse and render the color correction. - Good. I'll go ahead and say hello and we'll be right with you All right. and yet: Our mind is an image of the cosmos. Everything is one and everything is right. And we are here, to have that experience.

I asked you that before, didn't I? No. Are you all right? I don't know. If I were you, I'd drink less carbonated water, too. You only get flatulence from it and ride your bike more often, you know. Because of circulation and - Done? Yeah, almost. Yes, all I've gotta do now is add the time-lapse and render the color correction. I'll go ahead and say hello and we'll be right with you, ok?

You have been there for thirty years, we think that's wonderful . . All the best to you dear Martin . almost. that's how it would have been... Wuuuh... - Wanna see a magic trick? - Yes, of course. Have a good look, first I shuffle a bit of course. Obviously, very professional, of course. All right, now pick a card, I'm not allowed to see it, only you are. - Okay, you remember it? - Yes. Of course the card deck needs a bit of magical salt So look closely - Hey! - Ah hi, thanks. - Sorry about earlier, I meant no offense. - Ah never mind, wasn't my best performance either. - I'm Penny, hi. - Hi, Merlin.

Mmm, thank you. - Can you do anything else besides singing and magic tricks? - Sushi. I make quite a good sushi. - No, I can't stand fish. -Well, what about vegetarian sushi... Where and when? - Next week? - Okay. - Alright... Hey... - Miro? Do you know where he is? He was just rushing out. - Why? Where to? - Probably ate something bad. Well, fantastic. Well, there you go. Our editor, Merlin. will be with us in a moment. Then I suggest you take a seat. Here you go. Jump for me! So, we definitely need that, Wasabi, for later... You can take this. - Don't rub it off on me. - Surely! - Boah, this is getting hot as hell. - Wait, wait, we have this thing for that. - What's that? - I really burned my fingers. Ouh, there is rice everywhere. I think I'm gonna go get a rag or something. Ah, okay. - I got it, I got it, I got it. - Very well done, very, very well. - Do you have a smaller knife? - Nah, I've only got big knives to show off. Okay, it's a lie. - Do you want to drink something? - Yes, do you have coffee or something? - Coffee I've got, with milk? - Yes, do you have soy milk? - No. - Then black please.

Did you order something? With hot regards. You all right, man? I'll be in the kitchen if you need me. But I'll come around, okay? - Done? -They'll be here soon. - Okay. Hello time traveller. My mame is Tadeus Moff, we don't know each other. And yet, I've been looking for you for an eternity. What I have to tell you sounds strange, but... - Here you go. - Merlin! This is our editor Merlin. - My pleasure, Salander. I suggest you take a seat first, please. I see we have some fresh water for you. If you want to help yourself. Anyone something to drink? Let me check, where that coffee is. Come on, you can do it. Just take your time. Well, I'm taking my time already. - This is so much fun. Ah, great. - That's what I told you. - Next time we'll go swim- - Urgh! - I have been bullied, well at least a little bit. - As a child? - Yes. - Why? - Had glasses. - Glasses, that's it? Yes, that's all that kids need, you know... you wear the wrong sweater or something like that and they set their sights on you right away. - Hm, okay. - Haven't you? No, well I was never the athletic type. That wasn't really great, but other than that. - But you made it up here. - Yes, I made it up here perfectly well. Well, that's the way it is. - But would you do anything different? - From the past? - Mh. - Nah, I don't think so. Me neither, I think. Maybe leave out the glasses. If you have a choice. - You have real pretty eyes. Show me. - Thank you. Oh, ey wait for me. - Hello. - Hello, Wizard. - Oh man. - If you jump, you get the kiss. You'd better call the fire department and tell them to fetch the fat tomcat out of the tree. Jump! - It's very easy, just jump. - Yes, I'm doing it. Do it for me. Jump! - Hey. There's a package. - Hey. Yeah, I'll handle it. -Sorry, I have to carry on. - I can help. Hello time traveller. My name is Tadeus Moff. We don't know each other. And yet, I've been looking for you for an eternity. What I have to tell you sounds strange. And I hope that you will find the feeling within you that says you can trust me. At least it's one truth, and if you believe me, it will become yours too. I'm sure you already noticed our little dilemma With the time. Actually, time is always a problem. At least, subjectively. I am also part of this time problem, but I am by far not as much in the center of it as you are. It's like throwing a stone into the water. The circular waves are smaller where the stone lands The exact circumstances that led to it, I can't explain right now. I'm afraid there's no time for that. But let me put it this way, In the future, there will be a problem for which I assume I am partly responsible. Or. will be. Anyway, there are people, who feel these time waves. And you're one of them. I have a quest for you. Have a look at the drawing, attached to the kaleidoscope. - Merlin! It's a seemingly simple drawing without much of a message. But if you fold it in the righty way, if the right spots touch each other, a completely new image is created. - Open the door, Merlin! Fold the time wave. And get the right points to touch each other. You need to go to the epicenter. It's not far from you. However, not feasible within a single time wave. That's why you have to shift the time wave's starting point. You can do that, by creating an event within the reversed time phase that originally did not take place. Once this paradox occurs, the time wave will start over again. The hourglass should match the interval of a time wave in your section. And the compass shows you the way to the epicenter. You'll meet a second time traveler. She's got the weapons. Together you must jump into the source. Inside the source all you've got is one time wave, to master your actual quest: Kill the clown and rescue the mermaid. - Miro! - What is the matter with you? - The door is locked. The kaleidoscope will help you focus, because that's what kaleidoscopes are there for. You'll know when you need it. And remember: No matter what we do, there will be a reaction as a consequences. It's uncertain, however, if we only influence the future with the things we do. Maybe our decisions in the present also leave traces behind in the past. - Merlin! However, we certainly influence the present with every action. By saving your timeline you'll save the time itself. Do it! Kill the clown and rescue the mermaid! - Open the door! - Yes, hello? - Hello, Wizard. Oh, I'm not a magician today, today I am a sheriff. Tell me, where are you anyway? Hey, really funny. - I've been waiting here the entire time. - Sorry, took a bit longer. - But look, I'm a mermaid. - Very, very beautiful. Okay, come on. - Tell me, where'd you leave your gun? - Oh, I don't know, I couldn't find it. - Oh. - Never mind. Watch it. Whoo! Yeah? Impressive. Wow, awesome. And you'd just give this to me? - Hey. - Yeah, thanks, I'll open that. - If you need anything. - I have to carry on, sorry. Miro! Well, there you go. Our editor Merlin will be with us in a moment. Are you...? Yes, hello? - Hello wizard. - Hi. I just met an old friend of mine. and he asked me to give this to you. - Now you have your own gun! - Great, cool, super. - Yeah, well, maybe a bit too modern but awesome... - Cool, wanna go? - Yes. Yeah, come, come, come, come. - Come on, dance! - I can't dance. Oh, nonsense. Okay, look. I'm going to explain the only rule of dancing to you. It doesn't matter what you do, just make sure you do it from the bottom of your heart. - They'll think you kidnapped me. - Oh nonsense, I am Captain Space World. - I'm here to save you. - Oh, my hero, save the mermaid! That's right, you crappy zombies. Oh, shit! - Hey. - Hey. - Did you order something? - Did you order something? - It says your name on it. - It says your name on it. - Is everything all right with you? - Yeah, it's all good. You know that I have to carry on, I'm okay. I'll go to the kitchen and take out the garbage. - Done? - Yes. You know, they'll be here soon. I'll go say hello and then we'll be right with you. Merlin. Merlin! Well, that's our editor, Merlin. I suggest you take a seat first, please. Ah, I see we've got water, you can help yourself. And I'll check where that coffee is. I'm back again. And...? Is it you? Yeah, thanks for the talk. Kill the clown and rescue the mermaid. What was that? I can do that with the time... Shift the waves... Okay. And you? You don't talk? - Yes. - Because you can't? Yes. Is it possible that you don't feel like talking about it at all? - Yes. Here you go. Our editor seems to be... Merlin our editor, seems to be available to us in a moment. Maybe you want to take a seat first. What, and this is your compass? I somehow always draw the short straw. This is Schneider, I found someone in the basement on the left. Hey, it's okay. You don't have to be afraid. You're safe now. Did he just bump into you or what? We could've bought a ticket at least. Hey, Ava. I brought you some juice. Are you done with the drawing yet or do you need more pencils? Can I have a look? That... that is the man you were with? Are you sure? Let me put this away and get us something to play, ok? - Hello, emergency call center here... Is there a problem? Hello? Nah, everything all right, I pushed the button by accident. What does that mean, by accident? It's not that easy right now. The rule is that I have to send someone now and you have to wait `till my colleague gets there. No, that really isn't necessary. That's neither your nor my decision to make. Just stay in the elevator, someone is definitely going to have a look now. Until then nothing will happen at all. Oh well, I actually don't care. - Hello, hello, hello, wait a minute, hello! - I am impressed. And why are you here? Did you also get a message? What is that? That's your weapon. This one? Wow... thank you very much. You know... this thing with the mermaid and all that... I think it`s somehow connected to me. One thing is for sure, she wasn't alone. By now we assume that there were three more girls. The doctors say she feels guilty, because she was the only one who survived. We don't really know yet, what she's been through before she was able to hide in the basement. And if she could talk before she was kidnapped or if she's only been mute since the trauma, we don't know either. We have all this summed up for you in one folder. Oh and one more thing. As future parents of Ava, you should know about it to prevent her from being traumatized again. The man who abducted the children, always showed himself in a costume. This is a drawing that Ava made of him. Excuse me, I think that is your camera. What are they doing there? Let's go. Heinz, send two people to corridor ten, quick! Yeah, I know. Fuck. I think I might end up in a loony bin. That's enough. Leave me alone. Stop it now! Have a look at this. It`s for the mermaid. Jump into the source Jump for me It`s very easy, just jump. Jump into the source Hey. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do. You've already done it. Miro? Miro! Did a package arrive for me? Do I work at the post office? - I wanted to talk to you. Are you done? - Yes, almost. Good. They'll be here in a moment. I'll go and say hello and then we'll be right with you. Okay. - Miro, don't forget that coffee! Don't forget. - Yes, I'm already on my way. ... and unfolds in linear time. But already in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. the Dharmakaya is described. - Here you go. - Merlin. - This is our editor, Merlin. - My pleasure, Salander. No problem. I suggest you take a seat first. - I'm sure he'll be with us in a moment. - Here's some fresh water for you. If you want to help yourself. Let me check where that coffee is. Hello wizard. Hello. The future is free.
