Hmm. Just a little after lunch. Where's Alger? He has work in Manila. He couldn't come. And the girl you were with? Oh. She's gone. She went back to the States. [sighs] Don't worry. You'll get over it. As if I didn't know you. [chuckles] Of course. Sorry, Ben, I have to go ahead. I still need to go to Bulabog. Yeah. Mm-hmm. All right. Let's talk again tomorrow. I'll have breakfast at your place. -Sure. Good night! -[laughs] -Good night, Mommy! -Have a good rest. You look so tired. [grunts] -Mommy, thank you. -See you tomorrow. [chuckles] [indistinct chattering] [man] Guys, can you do a cartwheel? -It's easy. Look. -[woman] Go, Kayla! All right! -[man] You can do it. Go. -You first. [indistinct chattering] -Ben, what are you doing here? -[scoffs] I've been looking for you. How much damage has been done to these coral reefs? Substantial damages considering a lot of people come here to dive. It's just that the others are so reckless. Even if they've been warned by divemasters, they just don't care. Mm-hmm. But they have already developed a technology for that. They will be placing synthetic elements that will turn into reefs through time. How much will it cost to install these fake reefs of yours? It might... Well, that's the bigger problem. Are you being paid to collect garbage in Boracay? Look at what people have been doing. -Mm. -[laughs] They enjoy the beach and yet they litter everywhere. -Like this one! -Hey! Just throw that away. They make the beach their ashtray! Throw that away. -You look stupid! -Don't throw it there. There has to be a payoff. So if you want progress then there has to be sacrifices. [groans] What sacrifices? After they pollute this island... they're going to look again for another to commercialize and pollute. That's how it works. It's a cycle. -[indistinct chattering] -[laughing] It's just like that. Virus. Just like humans. My gosh, are we here just to eat? -Mitch, want to order? -Yeah? I'll have a shake. How about you, Caleb? [Caleb] I don't know yet. Menu please! -[club music playing] -[cheering, chattering] Yeah! Are you okay? I'll be back, Kelly. See you later. Be good. Excuse me, one Malibu pineapple, please. Hi! Hi! You know what? I think I know you. Yeah? Yeah. I might be wrong. But you know what? You look so familiar. Cheers! Cheers! [laughs] [cheering] [engine revving] -Ouch! -[Caleb] Hey! -Mitch! -Guys, there's something wrong! [Raisa] Come on, guys. Hurry up! -[Raisa] Mitch! What happened? -I don't know. When I stepped on the water, my foot suddenly hurt. I must have stepped on something. -What! -Can I see? I don't know! Don't they have doctors here? Excuse me, let me see it. [Mitch groans] Sea urchin. You stepped on an urchin. -Really? Are you a doctor? -[chuckles] No. You don't need a doctor for that. Come here. -Ah! [groans] -[grunts] Do you know that guy? -Mm-mm. -No. -Last... -Ouch! -Ah! -That's it? -You just squeeze lime on it? -Mm-hmm. The acidity of the lime will interact with the spikes inside. Wait. How will it come out-- -Don't touch it. -[Mitch] Hey! The more you poke it, the more it will go deeper. [Wally] Doesn't she need medicine? Well, there's a faster way to remove that. -What? -Pee on it. -[scoffs] -[chuckling] [Caleb] You're kidding, right? [chuckles] I'm not kidding. Pee on it. [scoffs] [chuckles] You'll be fine. And how would you know? You said you're not a doctor. No. But I know these things. You know what guys? I better go back to my room. I'm not enjoying anymore anyway. I can't even walk. -Can you help me? -Sure! We'll take you home but can you walk? Slowly. [chuckles] [indistinct chattering] -Here's your drink, sir. -Thank you. I forgot to say thank you! [chuckles] It's okay. [chuckles] So how's your foot? Well! It doesn't hurt that much anymore. I told you. [laughs] -You wanna join me? -Sure! Mm. You want something to drink? Maybe later. [chuckles] I don't even know your name. Ben. It's, uh, Ben Caballero. Mitch Valmonte. -Mitch. -Uh-huh. -So you don't smoke. -Mm-hmm. -You don't eat red meat. -Mm-hmm. And you only drink beer. [chuckles] So what do you do? [laughs] I'm allergic to alcohol. My body can only take one bottle of beer. I have lots of allergies. That's a pity. [chuckles] I've been a semi-vegetarian for two years. -Mm? -Yeah. Don't you feel weak at all? Do I look like a weakling to you? Look at me. Oh my gosh! Another hunk dude on the beach. Please. [Ben] So where do you stay in the States? [Mitch] San Francisco. So your family is based there? Well, my mom, her two kids, and second husband. My daddy is based here though. So now you're staying here for good? Well, my dad said to try it out here. lf it doesn't work out, I can always go back. Hmm-mm. Well, we shall see what we shall see. Thank you. Any more questions, Mr. Caballero? No. -So you're a lawyer? -Yup, before. And now? Well, I work for an organization called M.E.M., Mother Earth Movement. -Have you heard of that? -No. Yeah? Well, it's an international organization. You know, environmental protection and all this conservation... Okay. Huh? What do you think about it? It's cool. But what do you do aside from that? -[chuckles] -So you don't have a private practice anymore? I'm through with that. I prefer what I'm doing now. Wow. Superman with a heart. When are you coming back to Manila? The day after tomorrow. Okay. Do you have plans with your friends tomorrow? I don't know. Why? Are you going to ask me out? So are you asking me out? What if I did, will you go with me? Ask me first. Um... Michelle, let's see each other tomorrow. [scoffs] That's not a question. That's a command. Okay. Uh... Michelle, can we see each other tomorrow? Okay! [chuckles] I'll pick you up here at Discovery? I don't want to make you wait. Let's just meet somewhere. Café Ofelia, Station 2? Yeah, I know where that is. I've been there before with my friends. I saw you there. Aha. You remembered me? You have too much self-confidence. I just have a good memory, okay? 9:00 a.m.? Nine? You're kidding me, right? I don't even get up before ten. And since we're on a vacation, let's make it eleven. Okay. Okay. Well, goodnight. Thanks again, Ben. All right. Ah, Mitch. Are you sure you want to go back to your room now? [exhales] Relax, Mr. Caballero. There's still tomorrow. -Okay. -[giggles] Hey! What time are you supposed to meet? 'My! -You want to order lunch? -I'm okay, Mommy. -Sure. -It's okay. It's okay. Hi! I'm so sorry I'm late. Something's wrong with my alarm. And my friend is still asleep, she got home at seven this morning. Have you been here long? No problem. -I just got here. -Okay. Yeah. [chuckles] -Mommy Offie, this is Michelle. -[laughs] -Michelle. -Hi! -Good morning. How are you? -Hi. Good morning. -Good morning. Nice place. -Thank you. Did you know that Mommy Offie was one of the first settlers here in Boracay? -Since 1977! -Since 1977. Yes. -Wow! Really. -Yes. They met in Manila. Then they decided to take a vacation here with the husband. Then I guess the husband fell in love with the island. And they settled here. And this is my husband. Isak. -Isak Lindqvist. -Oh... -Where is he? -Oh, he died five years ago. -I'm sorry to hear that. -Oh, no! Don't be. Everybody has to leave eventually. And besides, he had a good life. As he said, the most important decision he made in his life was to stay here in Boracay with me. Oh. And he also told me when you know what will make you happy, -you grab the opportunity. -[laughs] Sometimes there are no more second chances. [chuckles] Oh, wait! I have an idea! Wait! Wait! The camera. The camera. Come on! I'll take your photograph! -Mommy Offie. -Come on. come on. -Let's pose! Let's pose! -It's fine. It's fine. Why are you two like that? You're like waiting for a boat at the pier! Come on, come on! Let's have some excitement. Let's have some energy. -Okay, come on. Come on! -Put your arms around her. There you go. Cheek to cheek. -Better? -Closer! Cheek to cheek. -Okay. -Yeah. -Come on, cheek to cheek. Good! Smile! Oh yes! [engine revving] See this? Hmm? All of these. All of these are puka shells. That whole stretch from one end to another. They're all crushed shells. It took like millions of years so they could form in the sea. Millions of years. -Wow. -Yup! But if we take this for granted and become careless, -Ben. -they were-- Are you going to lecture me about the end of the world? -No. I was just explaining. -[chuckles] Okay, Ben. How about we just enjoy this moment. Enjoy the beach. Stop looking for reasons to get mad. [Mitch] Are you a family of lawyers? [Ben] Um, my daddy, my brother, his wife, also our youngest sister. That's why you took law? No, it's not that, it was also my choice. lf it was your choice to become a lawyer, why did you stop practicing? Long story. Okay, well, I'm listening. You'll just get bored. No, I won't. Try me. [Ben] Okay. Because of my desire to be a very good lawyer, I ended up doing something really wrong. Like? After I won the case. After I was paid a lot of money and people started congratulating me. Then, I learned the truth. Like, 12 people died, mostly children. Well, Ben, that's not your fault. I mean, you're just doing your job. For me, it's not a matter of being a good lawyer. I just want to make sure that things are better. Well, we all want to make things better, Ben. But is there someone, you know, who's really doing something to make a difference in our world? Like all we do is complain and complain and complain but we don't do anything about it really. You know. This conversation is getting really serious. -[chuckles] -Come on, let's go for another swim. Come on. Come on! What time is your flight tomorrow? 7:00 a.m. But I have to be there at 5:00. I guess I won't sleep. You want me to take you to your resort now? No, it's okay. -Sure? Yeah, I'm sure. -All right. -Yeah. Okay. Why did you do that? Uh, I'm sorry. It's okay. -No, really, I'm sorry. -No, really, it's okay. -No, I'm sorry. -lf you want, you can do it again. [chuckles] So? Don't be ashamed. You can do it again. You've had how many boyfriends? If you're not afraid of what love brings Hmm... Five? Six? -♪ Then endings are beginnings ♪ -Five? Six? [chuckles] -♪ Of beautiful things ♪ -How many of those were serious? Two and a half. [laughs] Okay. So what's the story between those two? What happened? I mean, like, why did it end? -Including the one-half? -[laughs] Well, they wanted too much from me. ♪ 'Cause love begins With one hello ♪ Why? What's too much for you? More than I'm willing to give. ♪ Now it's easy letting go ♪ And you? How many girlfriends have you had? -♪ Is how it starts ♪ -One. -♪ You might win it all ♪ -For how long? -♪ Or lose your heart ♪ -Three years. Almost four. What happened? She just broke up with me, uh, the day before we were supposed to get married. Why would she do that? Um, she gave me reasons that I still can't understand until now. Not that it matters. I mean she's married already. She got two kids. So that's okay. It's okay. That's why I don't want relationships. Because in the end, you just hurt each other. I know the feeling. There should be no expectations. Because the more that you have expectations, the more you invite hurt and disappointments. [chuckles] I agree. And after all, nothing lasts forever. I don't believe in that anymore. But you know what, I want to dance. Let's dance. -[stammers] Dance? -Let's dance! Where? -[stutters] Here? -No. There! -There? -Come on. I want to dance. I want to dance. -Yes, there. -[laughs] -Oh, okay. -[giggles] Come on.

Did he approve these materials and had he seen the other collaterals as well as the new version of the open house? How about Daddy? Did he approve the new presentation of the price list? Yes. Yes, ma'am, it was already approved. Michelle, excuse me. Um, thank you! -Uh, please excuse me. -[man] Okay. Hi, Daddy. Did you see your mom before you left San Francisco? Hmm-mm. I did. Did you meet or did you just talk on the phone? We met. We had lunch in St. Francis and she was with everyone there to visit a friend. And as usual, she criticized me. She said my dress looked awful, that I look unhealthy, that I'm too thin now. Which is a good thing, Daddy, because before she told me I'm too fat. -[chuckles] Mitch. -[chuckles] Yeah, I know. But don't worry, Daddy, I'm-- I'd worry even more if she stops picking on me. But anyway, how are you? How have you been? I'm good. I'm good. I'll be in Singapore tomorrow for a three-day visit. Daddy, the reason why I accepted your offer is so I can spend more time with you. But then you're hardly there. I have so much work to do because of the new development that we need to launch within three months. That's why I need to go to Singapore to close the contract with the bank, and some possible financiers. But Daddy, the reason why you're paying so much to so many people is for them to help you. But in the end, you're doing everything. Now you're beginning to sound like your mother. [chuckles] -Hmm. -Hi, Paco! Sorry, I'm late. Um, no problem. Uh, Mitch, I want you to meet my friend, Sharmaine. Hi! [Anton] It's a suicide mission for your group. You're against the big guys. [Ben] Are you trying to say that we should withdraw the case? That we cower with fear even if we know we're right? Is that it? [Christine] Boys, stop it please. Anton just wants you to be careful. He didn't say that you should withdraw your petition. Stop it. We're having lunch. Benedicto. You seldom come home and when you do, you just fight with your siblings. [Leo] Come on. You should get used to your brother. That's why I don't want to come here even on Sundays. Mommy just gets annoyed. That's not true. Your mom really wants to see you. She's just worried about what you're getting yourself into. Dad, I know what I want for myself. That's very clear. You're her favorite. lf I'm her favorite, then why doesn't she try to understand me? And you? Did you ever try to understand her? [Marietta] Daddy, daddy, come here first, give me a hand. All right. Look at your mother. -Just like a young lady in love. -[chuckles] Marietta, how many are you baking anyway? -That's too much. -[chuckles] It's not. I will send these to the children later -when they get home. -Hmm. [sniffs] But in fairness, it smells delicious. Of course. -Delicious. -Ah! -Why? -Careful, that's hot! But we can eat this later right? -Later. -You won't give everything away? You'll have one. [club music playing] -[laughing] -[indistinct chattering] -Bye, guys. -Bye. See you later. [indistinct chatter] I'll just go there. Mm. Going somewhere? Excuse me, guys. Hey, Mitch, where are you going? -Ladies. May I? -Okay. Mitch! What's up? -Oh, hey! -When did you get here? -How are you? -Look at you. How are you? I'm okay. I've been here for 3 weeks now. -Wow, this is strong! -You're right. I'm still dizzy. -Hey Ben, what's up? -Hey! -Mitch is there. -Mitch? -Yes, right there! -Okay! -Text me okay? -Nice to see you! -All right, bye. -See you! Mitch, how are you? What? How are you? I can't hear you. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? Good. I can't believe this. [stammers] I found you, this is destiny. Ben, that's the corniest line that I've heard for this year. What's so unusual about us seeing each other again? You just left me. Wait, are you mad at me? Why would I get mad at you? You left me sleeping alone on the sand. I had a flight, remember? I was running late. I haven't packed yet and you're still sleeping. Why didn't you wake me up? [chuckles] Why would I? Would you help me pack? Would you take me to the airport? I have no idea how to reach you. You didn't even give me your number. And why should I? Did you ask for it? [laughs] [sighs] It's too crowded here. You want to go elsewhere? Where is elsewhere? Uh, I don't know? Somewhere else? Sure! Um... I didn't bring my car. I just hitched a ride with Alger. Actually, I also just hitched a ride with Caleb. Okay. Um, is it fine if we just get a cab? What's the matter with that? Stop making a fuss. Let's go! Well, I'm working for my father's company. I'm assistant marketing manager. Whatever that is. Okay. So what do you do as an assistant marketing manager? Well, there's a manager and I'm his assistant. He gives orders and I give orders. But anyway, enough about me. What about you? What's keeping you busy? Just the same. Still trying to save the world. Yup! -Superman. -[Ben chuckles] -Thank you for the ride. -[chuckles] Why did you suddenly become formal? I'm just trying to be polite because you paid for the sushi and the cab. [both laugh] -Yes, you can kiss me. -[laughs] -Somebody's there. -[laughs] -Good night. -[laughs] [indistinct chattering] [giggles] [indistinct chattering] [cheering, laughing] [laughing] [laughing] Are you sleepy? Not yet. You? I'm okay. You're the type who doesn't stay up late, right? [sighs] This feels so good. What do you mean? Just the two of us. Very intimate. You? What about me? You feel good? Hmm.

Hi. Mitch... Attorney, be careful with what you will say. Sometimes, people say things that they don't really mean just because they feel something at a particular moment. So, is Michelle your girlfriend? No. We're just enjoying. That's it. -And that's it. -You're the man. I'm sure you just want to enjoy her but you don't want to commit. Like always. Hey, that was her idea not mine. You may be lucky now, but we'll see. Damn you. -Question. -Hmm. Do you still go out with other guys? Why are you suddenly asking this? Nothing. Is it wrong to ask that? Is it also wrong if I go out with other guys? That's not what I'm saying. I'm just asking you. Of course, it's also stupid if I ask you if you go out with other women, right? -[laughs] -Whoa! Attorney is speechless. Huh? No. I don't go out with other women since we started going out. You don't believe me? Huh? -Ben... -Oh. [laughs] If it's your decision not to date other women, then that's your choice. But, I just want you to know that I never required you to stop dating other women, okay? Okay, good. [giggling] Stop it. And you believed him when he said he doesn't date other women anymore? I don't know. I really don't care. And you made him believe you still date other guys. You know what, Mitch? You're such a bad liar. And what makes you say that? Because if you don't really care, how come you're not dating anybody else? [chuckles] Because she's always with this Ben. Yeah. I know what you guys are trying to say. And the answer is no. I just like it better this way. -Okay, if you say so. -[scoffs] You know what, you guys should know me better. The more you force me, the more I'll resist. And I hate obligations, especially in relationships. I've seen enough of my parents and look where they are now. Are you going out with your dad this Sunday? [Mitch] My dad is in Kuala Lumpur. Why? You want to join me? Where? Um, I want you to meet my family. Why? Oh, why what? Why do you want to introduce me to your family? Is there anything wrong with that? You introduce someone to your family when there's something going on between the two of you. Well, not necessarily. I just tell them about you. So I just want them to meet you. That's it. Hmm-mm. Okay. When you talk to your dad, like, do you talk about me? No. Why not? Should I? I don't know. Okay. -[Paco] Mitch? -Hmm? Who is this man? What? I don't know what you're talking about, Daddy. This man that you're seeing? [chuckles] And who gave you that news? You might think that Manila is a big place but news gets around really quick. Wait a minute. So who's updating you? Is it Edith? -Ah, okay. -[chuckles] -So, do you know him? -No. Do you know what his work is? As I said, I don't know the guy. I just heard that you've been spending so much time with this fellow. I'm just scared that one day, the inevitable will happen. And what would that be, Dad? That I will lose the only constant woman in my life to another man. Mm. That won't happen. Okay, Daddy? -Okay. -[giggles] What time is it? Is he still coming? Your dad called him last night. He said he's coming. He might be stuck in a meeting with his group. lf Benedicto comes, then good. -lf not, then what's new? -[chuckles] We're here. Guys. This is my friend Michelle. Michelle, that's my family. Hi, good morning. She said good morning. Uh. Hi! Oh, so you're the daughter of Paco Valmonte. Paradise Hills, right? Well, mid-cost housing but we do have some high-end projects. Oh, I think I read that. Is that the one in Tagaytay? -Mm-hm. -Oh, okay. Mitch works for her daddy. -Hey, eat your food. -Mitch, where did you two meet? Um, in Boracay. [laughs] -Oh, Boracay. -Oh, Boracay. I see. [laughing] I couldn't believe you got my taste in women. You're the only one who doesn't trust my taste. Because you had too many women. You think we don't know? What? Don't listen to those rumors. -I'm a good boy. -Rumors. Good boy. How old is she? Twenty-three. But she'll be 24 soon. -She's young. -What young? Even younger than your youngest sister. Why? What? How old is your sister? -Twenty-five. She's twenty-four. -Oh? That's just a year! -Still younger... -That's just one year dad. -No big deal. -Okay, fine. You're getting old. You need anything? Where is Ben? Oh, I saw him walking around with his father. You know my husband Leo, after he eats, he likes to walk. He doesn't want to have a big tummy. Um, can I help you? Oh, no, no, I'm alright. Thank you. No, really, please, let me help you. Uh... Well then, just bring out all the dessert plates so we can serve food in a while. Sure. Um, where are they? Can you please bring out the dessert plates? Just give them to her. -Here. -Thank you. Ben has always mentioned that you love cooking and baking. Of course. I just never really had the time to cook because I was teaching Humanities. Hmm. And even when I got married, I never stopped teaching, until Leo retired. Did Ben tell you? I, myself, bake our bread everyday. -[laughs] Really? -Hmm-mm. Ever since our children had their own lives, it's just me and Leo. I thought it would be depressing. I was wrong. My father was right about what he said. In the beginning, it's just you and your spouse. But in the end, it's still just the two of you. [laughs] You know, it's very important that whoever becomes your spouse, above all, should also be your friend. In fact, your best friend. Because there comes a point that romance will be gone. But the friendship of the couple still remains. Um, we'll go ahead. We still have to run errands. Yeah. Thank you so much for a wonderful lunch. Anytime. Our house is always open for you. Thank you. Uh, Ben, say goodbye to Mommy first. Mm. For a while. -I'll be quick. -Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Fine. Mitch, sit down. Let's chat some more. Yeah. -Ma. -Benedicto, you need anything? Michelle and I will go ahead. Oh. Wait. Where's the food that I packed for Ben? Ma, I'm okay. What are you saying? The maid told me that you haven't been eating. Don't be too hard-headed, okay? Sit. Here it is, Ma'am. So, when are we going to see you again? Next year? [scoffs] Ma, I'm sorry. I'm just busy with a lot of things now. So that's why you don't have time to visit me and your dad. You can always call us or even send a text message. Okay, okay. I concede. I'm sorry. Benedicto-- Ma, please, I know what you're going to say. [gasps] And since when did you begin -reading people's thoughts? -[chuckles] Benedicto, stop jumping to conclusions. And don't reason out to me like a lawyer. -[sighs] -Fix your life. That is all I'm asking from you. Ma, there's nothing wrong with my life. -Okay fine. You drive safely. -[scoffs] Mm. Thanks, Ma. Benedicto, I like her. What? Michelle. I like that girl. Why are you looking at me like that? [chuckles] [sighs] I just want to let you know, just in case you still don't know. What? You make me happy. Even if you're crazy sometimes. [both laugh] But still... I never thought I could be this happy again. You're not going to say anything? He's too good. Even his family is too good to be true, like the happy families we see on TV. Wait, since when did a good boyfriend become a problem? [scoffs] He's not my boyfriend. Okay, whatever. FuBu, playmate, human hobby. Call him whatever you want. Look, I know myself too well. I panic whenever I feel this way. He loves me too much. I'm just going to break his heart. I don't want to hurt him. Is that really the problem or you don't want to get hurt again? I've seen too many failed relationships. And after that they can't even be friends. I don't want to lose Ben even as a friend. So what are you going to do? [sighs] [Mitch over the phone] I'm good, and you? I'm just home, reading. So what time are you going home? I don't know. Maybe in a while. Why? Just asking. Are you drinking? Not so much. Are you driving? No, Caleb will. Is he drinking? [chuckles] Wait, Ben, why are you interrogating me? [Mitch] Ben, don't talk about them like that, you don't even know them so don't judge them. Of course, I know them. I met them in Boracay, okay? So I know what they do when they get together. What if you get harmed? [scoffs] Yeah? Like how? Huh. What if, hmm? What if they start drinking? That's normal. But then, you get into an accident, or into a fight. And you're with them. Ben, look. I know these people. And I will admit, yes, sometimes they can be silly. But they're not stupid. Okay, as you said, you know them better. You know what, that's exactly my point. You don't know them that's why I want you to meet them-- Tell me, Ben, why are you afraid of them? [scoffs] Of course not! I'm not afraid of them. I'm not afraid of classy people! Well, I certainly hope not. I'm classy! -Oh, really? Hmm. -Yes. [laughs] Where's Daddy? He's resting at the garden. What happened? He was playing golf then got dizzy, so his friends just brought him home. [Mitch] What did I tell you? Now it happened. -You are overreacting, Mitch. -Daddy! Come on, Michelle. I am all right. Uh, maybe I just lacked sleep. It's because you don't stop. You don't stop working. Come on. Stop treating me like a child. Well, Daddy, it's because you are acting like a child. -[laughs] -[scoffs] And now you're laughing at me. Daddy, look. I know your work is important to you. But it's not everything. I mean, how much more money do you need to make you happy? [laughs] You know for a while there, I think I heard your mom. [chuckles] Well, I'm not like my mother. Okay, okay. Even if you get mad at me, you're still my pretty, little girl. Then, I'll get mad at you more, okay? Why would you even wonder, Ben? [Greg] How old is Michelle? She's not a child anymore. -Twenty-four. -[chuckles] Come on, one's mentality doesn't dictate her age. And you were the one who said that she's a rich kid. She's spoiled. There, that's why I'm taking care of her, so that she'll be able to think better. -Right? -Wait a minute. What's the problem? Her being childish or her being too rich? No, it's not that. I just feel it's my responsibility to-- Responsibility? Why? Is she your girlfriend? In a way. [laughs] In a way? That's new. -Girlfriend in a way. -Okay. Girlfriend in a way. -Means no commitment. There. -Uh-huh. -Uh, who doesn't want one? -What? -You or her? -[scoffs] -[chuckles] -Her. Come on, Ben, did you really pass the bar exams? So you have no commitment? Why are you making her your responsibility? Because I want her to be-- -She has many problems and l-- -No, Ben. I think you have the problem, not her. [breathes deeply] You know I hate it when you do this. Do what? When you're like that. When you're so quiet, torturing me with your silence. I have to guess what's wrong with you. [sighs] lf you don't start talking, I'll go home. Wait. Wait. I'm just thinking of a proper way to say what I want to say without sounding stupid. Just say it. You know, sometimes you make me feel that you don't care for me at all. There you go again. No reaction. -See? -[scoffs] You want me to go hysterical? [sighs] You don't text me. And even when I text you, sometimes it takes you half a day before you reply. You don't even ask how I am, where I am and what I'm doing. Wait, what are you talking-- You don't even know my birthday. Why? Is today your birthday? No. On October. Then what is this? You're getting mad because I don't know when your birthday is out of the 31 days in October? It's not that. So what? You can at least show me that you care. You think I don't care? Well, you don't show it. [laughs] Please don't do that. I am not you. And you are not me, okay? -I'm not saying that. -Shut up! Do you want me to be honest with you? Really honest with you? Of course! I can't stand the fact that you text me 15 times a day. Come on, I'm of legal age. I don't need a nanny. But, Mitch-- I'm not yet done. You cannot talk, okay? And do not expect that from me either. Don't think that to show someone you care, you have to harass her with love and affection because I cannot stand that! Okay? It's not enough that you accept me for what I am. You also have to accept me for what I'm not. [man] They'll destroy everything, including the back of the mountain. [Ben] So that includes the river? Not just that, they'll block it, too. [Nora] What do you mean? When they cut the trees and they start digging the soil to make roads, it'll contaminate the river. So they'll just block the flow of the river. Can you help us? We just came from Tanay. Someone approached us asking for help. For what? There's a group planning to put up a subdivision and of course, that means they're going to cut all the trees. They'll even destroy the river. Imagine, those trees are 100 years old and they're just going to cut them. For what? To put up a new subdivision? [groans] Where in Tanay is that? San Rafael. [Edith] Here are the materials for Amber Hills. Edith, what are the towns near this Amber Hills development? Here. San Isidro, San Ildefonso and San Rafael. [gasps] Ma'am, we are considering all options to avoid disturbing or changing the existing surroundings for the Amber Hills development. And there is absolutely no way that we can avoid altering portions that grow by the mountain and the river. How much damage exactly will be incurred? Every rainy season, the river overflows. It becomes a bigger problem to those who live nearby. Just last year, three children drowned when the river overflowed. We're doing our best to minimize cutting down trees so they won't be affected by the development. [breathes deeply] Do you think they'll listen to us? Possibly. The media is very supportive of us. But I think it would be better if we are supported by influential people. -Politicians? -[sighs] No. They're just going to use us. Then by all means, use us. Besides, the media will listen to us even more when they learn that someone from the government is also against the establishment of subdivisions because they destroy the environment. Otherwise, do you think they'll listen to us? Hmm? Ben, will you please grow up? [sighs] You actually think that your group will be able to change the world? [stammers] Are we going to argue about this again? Will you stop blaming yourself for what happened to that case you won? It's not your fault that they died. But what are you doing to yourself? Brother, are you going to help me or not? Because if not, it's okay. I will understand. I'll help you. But that doesn't mean I agree with you. I'm doing this because you're my brother. Well, that's good enough reason for me. Michelle, it cannot be helped, you know that. The development of land requires changes. We'll have to build roads. Create communities. Drainage systems, water and electrical facilities. -You know that. -But... Dad, aren't we causing damage to the surroundings by-- Damage? You don't call that "damage". You call that needs. Needs for changes. Why are you suddenly interested in Amber Hills? -Well... -Why? Why all of these questions all of a sudden? I just wanted to be more involved with our projects. -Well-- -[Brian] Sir, it's Atty. Molina. It's about the group that filed a protest against Amber. He said it's urgent. Okay. Excuse, Michelle. Hello, Carlitos? What seems to be their problem? Who initiated this? You know what, things are getting better. My brother is helping me. He knows a lot of congressmen. Luckily, two of them are from his fraternity brothers. They're interested to help us. And another thing, there's a group of Singaporeans who are involved in the project, so... So... Mitch, I've been talking here for a while now, and it seems like you're not listening. Are you okay? Ben, there's something I need to tell you. Oh, this seems serious. [sighs] [cellphone ringing] Answer your phone. [sighs] Hi, Dad. Yeah, I'm okay. How are you? Yeah, I'll take care of it. Bye. How's your dad? He's fine. Good. So what are you going to tell me? What? You said you're supposed to say something important. Maybe next time. No, tell me. It's nothing important, Ben. What? -[upbeat music playing] -How could he not know that he's against your father? Well, he doesn't know. I'm sure of that. Then he should know. It's not that simple. Mitch, tell me. What's up with you and this guy? What's really going on? Mommy's operation is scheduled tomorrow. Anton is asking if you can clear your schedule so we can all be together. How come I just learned about this? Mommy didn't want to tell you. He doesn't want you to worry. It is only after the tumor is removed that we will know her true condition. Ben. Go home. Take a rest. I'll stay here. It's okay, Dad, I'm fine. It's okay, Carrie's here. And Anton will be coming back here after he brings Marides home. I'm not the one who's sick here. I'm okay. Dad. [exhales] Ma. Ben, can we talk outside for a while? -Why? -Let's go. Do you know who you're fighting against with your protests in San Rafael? Who? The partner of the Singaporean investors? No, Ben. [sighs] Do you know who is really behind the project? -Francisco Valmonte. -[coughs] Paco Valmonte. [scoffs] You knew all the time! It's very clear to you what we've been protesting! I've been telling you what my group has been fighting for. And you didn't say anything? What do you want me to do? Stop you? And if I ask you to, will you do it? Ben, I don't want to get involved. How can you not get involved? You work for your dad! So what are you saying? That I'm telling everything to my father? He even used a front, so that it might appear that it's a group of Singaporeans. Wait. It's one thing to get mad at my dad because of what he's doing. It's another thing to accuse him of fooling people. You know what, if that's how strong your faith is with your dad, then why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me that it's his project -and not the Singaporeans? -l already gave an answer. What are you trying to say? That you no longer trust me, you don't believe me? I never said that. -But that's how it sounds like. -l never said that! But that's how it sounds like. Ben, he builds houses, so people can have shelter. You know what, you just don't understand. I do understand. I'm not stupid. So don't you ever talk to me that way! You see, you see what I mean. You won't even give me a chance to explain! [scoffs] You know what, this is going nowhere. Let's just talk some other time. That's fine with me. I'll talk to you when you're ready to listen, okay? No, Ben. You will talk to me when I want to see you. Because I decide, you don't. Well, what now? What do you mean? Are we going to push through with this? This has nothing to do with our stand. It's a personal issue. Any more questions? -None. -None. [sighs] Marides, how are the results? It's not good, Ben. How bad? Malignant. Stage 3. [whispers] Stage 3. Stage 3. Benedicto, where did you come from? Hmm? Um... I just took care of something, as usual. [sighs] I just want to reiterate what I told them before you got here. I wouldn't allow anyone crying here. Come here. No tears. No crying. Ma. [sniffles] It's okay. [Mitch] Just when I've fallen for him, this has to happen. -[Raisa] He hasn't called? -No. How many days? Two. What is it about this guy? I know all your exes. You left them. Even if they're going crazy for you, you leave them. But now you're different. What's happening here? This guy's fighting against your dad and you still feel that way? You just don't understand Ben. Nobody except my father has loved me as much as Ben does. So you don't understand why I feel this way. You should have called first. I'm sorry. My mind is just too messed up. What's wrong? What happened, Ben? I think my mother's dying. Come here, Ben. Oh, you're here. Hello. [chuckles] How sweet of you to come and see me. Ben fell asleep because he's been preoccupied lately. Michelle, thank you. For what? [chuckles] Thank you for looking after Benedicto. Michelle, I want him to be happy. And you make him happy. He said that? A mother knows. So, how do you want us to go from here? What do you mean? Mitch, we cannot go on pretending that there is no problem. We can't just ignore this and hope that one day everything will be fine. Because it won't. Well, Ben, let me ask you. What do you want to happen? Don't make me decide. Well, don't make me decide either. Okay. [sighs] Just tell me, if you think it's best that we don't see each other anymore. Is that what you want? No. Do you still want me? Yes. [sighs] We'll wait and see. Let's just live for each day. Let's not make any plans. And please, no demands. No expectations. No commitments, right? No commitments. No responsibilities. Let's just enjoy each other while we can. [Ben] When the congressmen ask you, don't panic, just answer them straight. They wouldn't get mad at us? Why will they get mad? This is just an investigation. Ben. Brian, who is that man? Atty. Caballero. He's the group's legal counsel. [Mitch] I know, I'm late. I didn't say anything. Ben, I know you. When I'm late, you get mad. And you expect me to understand you when you don't make it on time. Because I show up late when I come from work. -You, where did you come from? -From work too. Actually, can I order coffee first before we go? [waiter] Ma'am. I'm so harassed from my meeting, especially because Dad's there. -Thank you. -Welcome. Okay. How's your dad? You know I haven't had lunch. Maybe I should get a snack? [Ben] We've decided we'll not let this affect us. Still it's the same. [Alger] Well, did she say anything? Didn't she tell her father about you, yet? -No. -Oh. Let's say she begged you to drop the case because her father's involved. Will you do it? I can't do that. [clicks tongue] It's my conviction. And that's more important than her? Have you told your father about us? No. And he's not asking you who's the guy you're always with? We respect each other's privacy. What if he finds out? I'll cross the bridge when I get there. Daddy. This is Ben Caballero. Yes. I know him. Good evening, sir. Maybe they would like to join us, Paco? No, I don't think so, Christine. I think they want to be alone. Have a good evening, Michelle. You too, Daddy. Good night, sir. See you. You don't have to explain. Dad, but please, I want to explain. -Let me explain. -The point is... you knew from the start. You knew that I'm the one he's going against. Yes. And you did not try to stop him? [stutters] I can't do that. Because you think he's doing the right thing. Is that it? No. It's not that I think that he is right. It's just that I can't use the fact that you're my father to prove him wrong. What do you want me to do, Daddy? As I've said, Michelle, it's your life. Don't ask me. Well, if there's anything that I can do, please tell me. Even if I'm your father, you have to decide on your own on what do with that man. But you know what I feel and think about him, Michelle. You know. Benedicto, take care of your daddy, okay? He might be acting strong but deep inside, -he has a soft heart. -Yeah. Like all of you guys in this family. You look very strong but I know you deep inside. That's why, Benedicto, you should look after your dad. Mom, I'm walking out if you don't stop that. -Ben. -Hmm? I have cancer. [sighs] And your dad is not used to being alone. Yes, but you're not going anywhere right? You're not leaving us. You promised us you'll fight. You're fighting right? [sighs] What's supposed to happen will happen. But it's not for me to decide what happens in this fight. Life is really like that. That's why I'm telling you these things. Okay, Mom. lf that's what you want. Promise. Now, can we change the subject? [phone ringing] Uh, Edith, did anyone look for me? Did anyone call? No one. By the way, the planning meeting for the launching party in Dasmariñas, Cavite got cancelled. Why? I thought the open house is all set? You still don't know? [Edith] We lost the case. Daddy? I'm all right, Michelle. I'm all right. I'll live. Yeah. [cellphone ringing] [sighs] Are you okay? Uh... Mitch? I'm hurting, Ben. I know. We haven't talked for days. You always avoid me. Why did it take so long for you to have the courage to face me? Because I'm hurting too. It will hurt even more if you didn't face me. This is so funny. This is exactly what we've been avoiding, hurting each other. And look where we are right now. -Mitch. -Ben. I know how much you love your mother, 'cause that's also how much I love my father. So what do you want me to do? [sighs] At this point, can we do anything? Tell me, what else can we do? -Mitch? -[groans] Ben. Don't do this to me right now. You said we will try. And I did. I tried but I failed. It's not you, it's me. Ben, my choice is between you and my father. You should be the first to understand that. Do you want me to leave for a while? I've already convinced my father for us to go to the States. We'll stay there for now. I'm really sorry, Mitch. -I'm really sorry. -Don't say you're sorry. You just did what you had to do. [both sobbing] Mitch. Ben. Thank you. For what? For giving me the happiest moments in my crazy life. Maybe one day... -Yeah. -Maybe... Maybe one day. Someday. You know, the next time I see you again, I tell you. I swear, I really swear. What? I'll never leave you again. -Never. -l won't let you leave me. I love you, Mitch. Attorney. l love you too. [Carrie] Dad, do you know that Ben was elected to head the environmental organization for the Asia Pacific region? -Thank you. -I know. He got featured in Time magazine, right? -Okay. -Mm, see? Now our environmental problem is obvious. Mm-hmm. That's why we have stronger storms here. Okay, Ben, no speeches please. -Okay. -[laughs] By the way, Ben, did you and Michelle see each other when you went to the States? You didn't even call her? It's been two years. I just lost contact of her. And I don't know where she lives there. Everything's okay, Mom. Everything's just going to be fine. [Nora] Don't you get tired of going to Boracay? [Ben] Just let me be. I've been working for three months straight. So you're going there again with Alger. Mm-hmm. -And your dates? -[chuckles] He'll be looking for a woman he can fool there. [Mitch] Hey, Raisa. Yeah, we'll be there in about 20 minutes. Okay. Ben? Why? Hmm? Nothing. -Mitch. -Hi! -Thanks for seeing me. -So when did you get back? A few days ago. How are you? -Very good. We're all very good. -[chuckles] -[waiter] Ma'am. -Thanks! So, does Ben know that you're back? I don't know but I think I saw him. Did you try to get in touch with him? Well, I don't know if he still wants to see me. I think he's not sure if you still want to see him. Do you still want to see my brother? I don't know. He left for Boracay this morning. Why are you telling me this? Because I know what Boracay means to both of you. [laughs] Well, you know what they say. Whatever happens in Boracay stays in Boracay. Not all the time, Mitch. What are you saying? I said that I haven't seen Ben for so long. I just see his name in newspapers and in Time magazine. Wait, I'll show you something. -Just wait. -What now? One moment. -Look! See? -[Alger] Wow. You already have a fan club president, Ben! But of course. I've been bragging to everyone that I'm close with this famous guy. [upbeat music playing] Hey, where are you going? I'll just get some fresh air. You have a date, right? Liar. -I'm going to look for one. -Good luck. I'll see you later.
