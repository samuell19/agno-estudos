The Slovaks and Ukrainian yearly smuggle here tons of cigarettes and hundreds of illegal migrants In a few months? time, Slovakia will become part of the Schengen area and its border with Ukraine will be hermetically closed - it will become the most guarded border of the EU. The smugglers will be cut off Ukraine 1 km from the Slovak border Are you transporting any goods? This is for you. Drive safely, please. The cancer is going to Austria - Are you transporting any goods? - No. Open the truck - What is going on? - Don?t freak out. Do you have a cigarette? Are you fucked up? "The Line" Adam I hate this house.. [Laughing] [knocking] - [girl voice] Please mom, I will piss myself Maybe she will shortly give up and pee at the back yard. [knocking] - Fast! - [girl] Come on! - [mother] Okay, come in. - Jesus. - I need privacy. Go. [alarm buzzing] Fuck.. Fuck fuck fuck.. [door shuts] - You will burn it on the pan, mom. - The burnt are the best ones. Where is she again? - Bread - Veronica, can you please? - Where were you? I was stripteasing.. for truck drivers. [laughing] Oh my god, at Ivor?s. - What did we say about your night trips? - He was teaching me for the leaving exam. - Yes? and did he teach you also about early pregnancy? - [kid] What is an early pregnancy? - [girl] What do you have against Ivor? - When you finish school, I will personally move you to Ivor?s place, but until then but until then you live under my roof.. - This is not your house, but grandma?s. - Beware of your language. - Or what? - Go to your room. - Okay, I wanted to wait for a more suitable moment, but - [banging on the table] can?t we really at least once have a breakfast like a normal family? - Enjoy your meal. - Did i miss anything? Thank you. Give me a cigarette. Luka, I will get you out of here, but I need time Three days ago, they cut the face of a guy from the next cell Imagine that, just like that. By a razor, smuggled in soap bar. Do you know why they did it? In order to see the reaction of the warden. You need time, but I have none. Luka, you need to be strong Yes! Sure. Four years, dad, four. And for what? For a fucking protest. For nothing. My son, I swear on my own life, I will get you out of here. But you need to help me as well. You need to stay out of it all. And believe. Believe? Do you know what I believe in? That if you don?t get me out as soon as possible, I will hang myself. Thanks for the cigarettes. Hey! Jona, how is he? You should have asked him yourself. - Two days ago, in the late night hours, we have here, on the border point Ub?a - Malyj Breznyj secured a contraband of smuggled cigarettes which was transported by two Slovak citizens of the total amount 140.000 pieces and 100kg of tobacco. The tax avoidance presented at more than 450.000 Slovak krowns. Within six months, we will join the Schengen area. and not even a mouse will get through the Slovak-Ukrainian border. As the chief of police I give you a public promise that the illegal smugglers? days are counted. Europe trusts us, and we will not fail Europe. Thank you. Distribute the dumb leaflets, badges and pens of the ministry.. - and let me know which idiot wrote this fucked up speech. - But it was me, sir. - I should have known. No public promises! - Remember it for your whole life - Victor. How..how long do we know each other? 10? 15 years? I thought it was clear. We are a family. And do you know what is the base of the family? - Kids? - Trust. - But.. - Why did they stop just us at the border? - You know the drill. Everyone wants to get a share, even the police. That is the deal. - If you played by the rules, they would have caught you with cigarettes and you?d be out soon. - But no, dear sirs need to smuggle half a kilo of metamfetamine. If you haven?t had me, you would go to jail. What would have you said to your son? Huh? So I will ask again. How should I trust you, if you screw me over? - But we needed money. - We all need money No, no no.. - Who was it? - It was Tes. If you don?t start talking now, you?ll be eating with feet till the end of your life, do you understand? - It was the first delivery, it was just the beginning. - Who managed it? Who managed it? [screaming] It was Krul. Look at me. It?s okay, it?s okay. I needed to do it and you know it of couse. Predlo will ice it down and it will be all good. Come on, come on. We are a family. [knocking] Mr. Krajniak, this is my love confession. I went to the market for birds and bought birds. For you my love. I went to the market with old iron and bought chains with heavy shackles. For you my love. Then I went to the market with slaves and looked for you, but did not find you, my love. I did not write it, but Pravert, a Croatian poet. It was unbelievable. Mr. Krajniak, I love your daughter Lucia and at this place I demand her hand. I will be a good husband and I will love her for better or for worse. I swear on my own life. Ivor, you are a good boy but not for Lucia. I am sorry. So now you know it. Through my brother-in-law Ivor and Lucia, we will be one big fucking family. Prdo, tidy it up and get them to the hospital. - This is all. - This was extra. And now what? We will visit Krul. - I hate him. - Stop it. He is your father and you have to talk to him. - I am leaving. - You are going nowhere. - Yes, I leave. - You will ruin your life. - You ruin my life, for God?s sake. - Don?t swear in front of me! I am adult and can do whatever I want! - [mother] But I lik Ivor - Yea, shit, for sure! Darling, but I am on your side. Nobody is on my side! Lucia said four times ?ass? and one time ?cunt?. - [mother] Lucia! - [father] What?s going on? - Are you asking what?s going on? - [knocking] Lucia. - [Lucia] What? - It?s me. Can we talk about it? - No! I will marry Ivor and nobody will stop me. Neither you, nor mama or grandma, nobody! Only through my dead body! - Farewell! - Open! Open! Adam, stop it..come. These are for me? - She is just a child. - She is 18. - Yes, she is an 18 years old child. - Yes. - Her whole life lies ahead. I was also 18. - She can do whatever - study, travel, she can.. - She?s pregnant. Adam? Adam! Dad? DAD! Mr. Krajniak, I am sorry. Open. I will tell it only once, so listen carefully. You disappoint me and you are done at the border. You disappoint Lucia or your kid and you are done for good. Do you understand? I swear on my life. Father. Show me that stone. Real one? Yes. What the fuck is that? [fucking like rabbits] Life at the border is difficult. The young leave abroad, the factories are closed. There is no work. And everything seems vain. But we.. We need to persist. If not us Then who? I will tell you who. Lucia Krajniakov? and Ivor Sosjor decided to enter the sacrament of marriage. In three weeks they will give their marriage vows and become one body. If anyone has any knowledge why these two young people cannot enter into marital status, speak now.. - Praised be, Jesus Christ. - Forever Amen. Listen to me, guys, last time on the way home from the shift and in Tibava, in the middle of the village there is a lama standing there. I thought I am getting crazy from the work. Can a lama stand in Tibava on the road? - I will finish that later. Dear friends, in the life of each father a moment comes when his child grows up. Lucia, do you know what was the most bizzare when I first saw you? Your hair. All the nurses wanted to see you, because they have never seen a baby wich such long hair before. And considering that I begin to get bald, there is no doubt who you inherited it from. And when I held you in my hands then I realized you were mine. My child. And that it is my role to protect you your whole life. Ivor is a good boy. And trust me that I will make sure it will stay that way. Everything is as it should be. Everything is.. - For love! - For love! - And for living together of Ivor and Lucia! - Cheers! [inaudible] I just got an echo about a new transport. But, this time it will be different. Only one van completely full of cigarettes. Loading of goods at Mukachevo, crossing through Ub?a - Malyj Bereznyj and delivery at [SK-AT border] Jarovce-Kittsee. Sacramento, you will take care of the papers, the van and the license plates. Dimensions and the weight will be given to you tomorrow. Viktor, Gogo, you choose the most secure route. Prdo and Taras will be driving. Go through all details. We are not up for a surprise. Are you fucked up? I will take care of our friends in uniforms. And the last thing. We start only tomorrow. Today we drink for Lucia?s banns. Is that clear? - How is Luka? - It sucks, but he is alive. - How are you handling it with Hana? - Huh, what can I tell you. Son behind bars, first wife is a whore, current wife is mad about son being locked up and the ex-wife is a whore. House is not finished for 8 years already. So we eat, sleep and shit in one room like any wildlings. We manage well. You should consider Krul?s offer. You are lucky to be drunk now. We should have started with it earlier. Nowadays we would have been kings. Listen to me carefully. I do not know what happened to you, but I swear on the lives of my kids, that I will not transport even a gram of that bullshit through the border. Was I clear enough? Why the fuck? Because I am a father! Husband and a son. And you are the same. Do you know what Luka told me during the last visit? That if we don?t get him out of jail, he will hang himself. Can you imagine? Your own child? How much do you need? How much would you give? Let?s say for Martina I want to help you. Adam, in a half year?s time, there will be nothing left from your beautiful world. If you want to stand by and watch, feel free..but I will protect my family. With you or without you. What happened? Mom What? Let?s go. Ivor! Jona is a hothead, trust me. Tomorrow he will come to beg for forgiveness. He never behaved like this. I don?t like it situation. He is afraid. As we all are. Take Ivor to the group and show him how it?s done. From now on he is family. Adam? Let Ivor be. Alexandra, don?t get into things you don?t understand. Sasha.. [nickname for Alexandra] When I was eight my mother would drive me up to the green border, the "line". and would leave me there. What was my first task - to survive the night And what did you do? I shit my pants at the first sound. But after a while.., actually it took eternity the fear was gone, the eyes got used to the darkness. and suddenly I was safe In the morning, mother came. Do you know what she said? From now on, you are home here. - Couldn?t you escape, like me? - No it was impossible to escape. Where you get born, you die. And my mother knew everything - who drinks, who cheats on his wife, contacts.. Simply a barkeeper. When the iron curtain fell, she got advantage of it. She started a trade in alcohol with the Ukrainians and it started rolling - Petrol, cigarettes, people.. - And what about your father? I don?t have a father. They fucked it up pretty well, motherfuckers. Do you have something for me? Tonight, one van. Ub?a-Malyj Bereznyj. [border crossing] I will need a free passage through E50 - Goods? - As usual I get new faces from the ministry and boys are quite nervous about it. I will have to think about it a bit Was it enough thinking? And do you know this one? Do you know how the Pinocchio realized he is made of wood? - Yea I know it I do. - A good one, huh? [opening and closing of the car door] [breaks squeaking] Breakfast! Breakfast! Good morning darlings! Breakfast in the bed. Go on, go on, go on. [music rehearsal] [music rehearsal stops] [loud thump, baloons popping] [honking] [Slovak music playing] Now, allow me to invite here our good friend, the protector of the state border and our friend, captain Peter Bernard! [crowd cheering] [Slovak music playing] [thunder] Citizens, do not fight, please. Please. I order you in the name of law. End it, this does not have to happen every Saturday. [shot] [many telephones ringing at the same time] What are you doing? Give it the fuck back! Are you smoking? Hey! Hey! The van was registered on a Ukrainian company. Luckily it has nothing to do with you all. Thank you for your time. Gentlemen, I know now it is not the best time, but the van passed through the border as we had agreed. My boys did their job, so they should get the second half. An agreement is an agreement. When I was a kid, we had a dog. Total mongrel. Mother was a German spitz, father an "unknown soldier". He was called Har?i. He reeked, destroyed a shed, a sofa, gobbled toys, even curtains. But I loved him nevertheless. It was, namely, my best friend. But once, at Zelen?, Har?i was attacked by wolves. I tried to scare them away, but it was too late. He laid there, covered in blood. With his eyes bitten out and open wounds. We buried him with mom in the garden. Then I sweared that I will never have a dog. Never. And a month later, I had a new one. And you know what name he got? Har?i Nobody is irreplacable. Take Krull?s offer. I thought we closed that. You still don?t get it? We didn?t just lose money. We are in debt. A fucking big debt. And Krull will not be easy about that. - It is our chance. - But not like this. Jona I don?t trust anyone more than I trust you. Then open your eyes. Dacej, today?s visit is cancelled. What happened? Hey! Hey! What happened? He is in a hospital. Be careful, don?t get drowned. My father always said... If anything bothers you, gt rid of it. I like more... To let it flow. A transfer on Zelen? will be tomorrow. 10 pieces from Afghanistan. Keep an eye on it personally. And no more mistakes. Adam, greet your mom from me. Take care of it. Come on Enough. Just a bit. Okay! Krajniak is losing ground under his feet. We need to take care of him. Otherwise he takes us all under with him. Look, if they close the border, I am done. And you too. You know it too well. I don?t offer a jackpot. No fucking around. An honest 30% 50-50 and I am all ears. I need a free passage tormorrow between 3 and 6 o?clock. Free passage and free E50 road. - Goods? -As always, on a truck - And? - A passage through Zelen? at the same time. they will go through Domaslina, through Topo?a and to V?elinn?. Krajniak will be there. I will think about it. But I need to know. I told you that I need to think about it. Pay for it. [lighters flicking] We will begin here. We cross the border by the Northern saddle and then above Starina. The Ukrainian patrols will be here; Slovak ones here. We know what we encounter. Sure, we understand. - Sacramento and Ivor, you will stand here, to the northwest of Topo?a and you will be our eyes. - Hm. We want it till the sunset. Then they will drive the people to the Austrian border, when the other party takes them over. - Okay - Questions? Who will lead? Jona and me. Heil Hitler! Are you a fucking idiot? Omg, no I thought we?d need a battle cry. Something else. Prdo is dead. I have seen with my own eyes how Krull tied him up and threw him in the lake. - Where? - Somewhere at Luj?e We don?t know anything about Taras? Give us a moment. Are you okay? And you? Have a look around and find a new supplier in Ukraine. But quietly. We pay the debt and take care of Luka. You have my word. Okay. But now I must drive Hana to work. Otherwise she?ll bite my balls off. [phone dialling] - Are you ready? - Yes. - Boss? - Give me your weapon. - What is this? - Bling bling style. - Call Viktor. You will be watching out. Then we will go according to the plan. Now. -Ah.. [phone dialling] [phone ringing] There was nothing said about a kid. Monkey as any other [walkie-talkie] [radio interception] Slam it. You fucked it up. But you told me to slam it. I told you to slam, not to fuck it up. Is the light on? No it is not. So you fucked it up. Run. Hey! Stop! Police! Stop! Don?t come any closer, otherwise I?ll shoot her. Hands behind your head! Police! Don?t move! Come on! We would need you to come to Slovakia. It is necessary to identify the body of your brother. Where are you? Do you hear me? Come here! Stand up to me! Look into my eyes! What do you want from me? I have never wanted blood! Never! Reply! Where are you?! What is your name? [hearing in progress] - Asylum What shall I tell the committee? - The truth. An accident it was. You cannot leave. You understand? You must stay with us, with the family. - That is why I need to leave. - Adam I need to solve it. - Oh stop it! If you leave now, then it?s over. Do you understand? - I?ll be back. - Adam! Adam? Is father and mother splitting up? A husband and wife don?t split up, they divorce. - Nobody is going to divorce. Go play. Go to your room. - Granny.. GET OUT! Come, come. [gun cocking] Is that you? What happened at the green border? Adam, that was a damn coincidence. Who gave you the intel? I don?t know. Really don?t know. One of the new boys. Maybe an anonymous tip or what not. Start the car. - Adam, if I knew Ivor was there, then.. - Let?s go. On your knees! Do you want to kill a police captain? A corrupt police captain. Adam, if I knew that you were crossing the border, I?d never give the order, you know me. I never said I was at the green border. They will look for me. Let?s go back and we will make it all right. Will you explain my daughter why her fianc? lies in the mortuary? For a murder of a policeman, you?ll get 25 years, maybe a life sentence. The rest of your fucking life you will clean toilets and suck prisoners? dicks. And within a year they will carry you out in a plastic bag and nobody will remember you anymore. I will give you money. I will have my house given to you, all cars. Say just one word, Adam. What will you tell Kamila? What will you tell my kids? Adam, look in my eyes now. You are not a murderer. Don?t do it, please, don?t do it. Who knew about us crossing the border? Who? Jona. It was Jona. In God?s name, please don?t do it. Jona! Jona? We close this grave off, until the second coming of Jesus Christ. In the name of the God, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. My sincere condolences. I made a decision. And you will respect it. We will leave you. I will leave you. We?ll live somewhere else. At a different place. Without you. And then..you will maybe come to us. Five or ten years later. We will have a new start. But until then, I will have to take my kids from this house and you have to stay here. You need to stay and search for answers Why did you destroy our lives, Adam.. [whispering] I will never love anyone else. I want to meet him. Make it happen. What? Is it a crime to get drunk in one?s own house? This house will be yours only after you buried me well, darling. Sasha has... I fucked it all up. Everything.. You know that we are stronger than others. We are different than others. Your father was a weakling, that never made peace with the fact that he was a nobody. But never did anything to make it change. A hero that gets wasted every day, comes home drunk every evening, raging. And he would focus his anger on me. He thought he would humiliate me. But he never succeeded. Never. On the contrary. And I let him. Let him do what he wanted, beat as much as he wanted. A wrech. But only until he raised his hand on you. I saw him that night. I saw him how he stood above you with this awful leather belt. And your back was all covered in blood. But you kept quiet. Quiet. Made no sound. Because you are exactly as I am. We are the same. I know that you.. you saw me. You stood behind the window, when I dug him in, in the ground under the walnut tree. But you kept quiet. The whole time, you did. Come here. I would never have thought, that I will be relaxing by cooking. Are these pelmeni? Mukachevo pelmeni. Father?s recipe. I am sorry I was not at his funeral, but.. Seeing him laying in the ground would have killed me. He talked about you often. He held you in high regard. That is why you should know that he died in peace. and respectably...As he alway wished. May he rest in peace. Secret ingredient. What brings you here? I came to pay of the debt of my son. Anna, you know I respect you.. But this is between Adam an me. We both know that, he cannot pay it off alone. Then you should know, that after the deal at the Green, th price rose fivefold. Is this a joke? What will I use a quarry for? And even in Slovakia. You will not regret it, and you?ll understand, when the border closes. Trust me. We should cheers to that. For those who have left us. For those who have left us. Mom? Are you home already? Adam, Adam... Do you know what is the difference between us two? A very thin line. Between those you can rely on... And the other ones. It is just like weeds. It is not enough to pluck a few. If you want to get rid of it, you need to destroy it all to the very last leaf of every weed. It is a dirty job, but then the garden will flourish. That?s all, Adam... The end. You cannot kill me just like that! Come on, get up! I am a god here! Do you want to bet? Travelling without passport controls on the border with Austria, Chechia, Poland or Hungary. Previously only a dream, now a reality. As of midnight, Slovakia became part of the Schengen area. Except celebrations of border opening, that took place in the crossing Petr?alka-Berg there were also celebrations of closing the border at the crossing Ub?a - Malyj Bereznyj. This is not only a big day for Slovakia, but also for Europe. We never forgot our main goal and that is security. We need to protect our nation, traditions and culture. Europe is putting a great deal of hope in us. And we will not disappoint her. I give you my word that both our border and our Europe will be protected. I baptise you by the name of Ivor. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Why are you just staring? Go! Go! Come on! Go! There you go! Translated into English by schwarzooo
