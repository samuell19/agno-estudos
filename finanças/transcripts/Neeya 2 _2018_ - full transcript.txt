In mythology, the demon Kalingan took the form of a serpent... ...to kill Lord Kannan. Kannan killed Kalingan by dancing on his head. Kalingan asked for forgiveness in humanoid form, at his last breath. He asked for a boon to metamorphose in any form whenever he wish. The merciful Lord Kannan, bestowed his boon. The lineage of Kalingan, in the form of serpents... ...are these Itchadharis. These Itchadharis still lives in Rajanaganathapuram, the southern district of Tamil Nadu. They lead the life like humans at day and suffer as serpents in night. To get relieved of this curse, these Itchadharis prayed Naganathaswamy. He heed their prayers and on the day, Which comes once in twelve years... ...is the "auspicious full moon day" (Maha Chitra Poornima) By taking the miraculous nuptial thread made by him... ...and keeping that on his feet, Both the couples must take holy bath and wearing holy clothes... ...and after performing pooja to Lord Naganathaswamy, The male serpent which is in humanoid form... ...must tie the nuptial thread to the female serpent. If done so, both the serpents can be relieved from the curse... ...and lead their life as humans. That's the boon bestowed from Lord Naganathaswamy. In their life, the serpents try once to take that nuptial thread. If they fail to take, they'll safeguard that nuptial thread... ...not to be taken by other Itchadharis. When the doomed serpents safeguard, Today is the "auspicious full moon day" which comes once in twelve years. Who should be born to whom is decided by destiny. Who should get married to whom is also decided by the destiny. Sometimes, that "destiny" acts cruelly. The companion for this child born in the Government hospital... ...is not a human being. But, a serpent! An Itchadhari snake has born to be a companion for this child. (A musical line from movie "VEDALAM") Oh my god, she looks awesome! (A musical line from movie "VEDALAM") Yes, mam. One large brandy. Hey, clear out. Greetings! How are you? I've come as per your liking. Come on, we'll dance. You like me, isn't it? -don't behave like a mad. How long will you be in distance?

But, we girls should bow our heads. Yes, madam. Thank you very much, brother. For what? Even if I'm in your stance, I would've accepted her love. When such a beautiful girl proposed. But, you rejected her, for the sole reason... ... as your colleague loves her. You're an exceptional guy. Maintain this at tonight's party too. Is she a girl? Always cracking and chasing. She expressed in public that she got vibes. Will a man marry her? -Brother... Sorry. I said by mistake, unaware she is your girlfriend. It's good, that he believes her to be my girlfriend.

We saw her yesterday. She is a good girl. Even the horoscope matches well. Hey what, my son? Dear, look at him. Tell me something. Sarva, she keeps speaking but you leave just ignoring her. Did I ask you to look for a match? You proceed when I ask so. Why are you still thinking about the past? Why are you speaking like past and present? Still, the past is in my mind. Dad, let me be free, please. In this world, if anyone knows that the girl he is in love... ...falls for the other guy, he'll kill her. Wait, let me finish. But, you... You're proposing another guy when I'm next to you. The reason, I'm not angry still because, I'm your Purush.(husband) Do you know, why I tolerate all these? Just because of the hope, that someday you'll come... ... to this Purush (husband) leaving your love. Sir, please, look front and drive. It's a disturbance for us when you turn often. Get lost. Madam, if you look at him henceforth, you can't see your Purush(husband) alive. It's better to die now. Is it here? Yes, madam. Here only, Sarva.... -what? Your lover, s here now. Thank you very much. No mention. How much? I don't want this shameless money. Thank you for the free ride. Get lost. Dude, watch this video. -Show me. It's good, right? I didn't see. It's the trending viral video. Oh. -it's nice, isn't it? Hi... Who are you? His girl friend. Hey, Come on, be seated. -Hey, Its okay, let her sit. Be seated. Thank you. Sir, who are you? Her (Purush) husband. Sir.. superb sir. How good it would've been, if my girlfriend had a husband like you. We're afraid to live everyday. You're great, sir. Okay, you shameless. -hey, Tell your full name. Saying as Purush(husband) everywhere. Sorry, madam. Brother, my name is Purushothaman. Right from my childhood, everyone calls me fondly as "Purush" From when they started calling me "Purush".... Hey, enough. No one allows me to speak. We're in love for three years. Hey congrats, dude. Hey, - for three years? If you torture me next time saying as you love me, I'll bang you. Come on. -thank god. Thank you, brother. I won't leave you how far you go. Hi friends, nowadays the news flash in Facebook before dailies. That's why, I'm sharing my problem here. I'm in deep love with a guy. I met him first at a success party. I don't know, why I like him? But, I liked him at first sight. I behaved mad to him instead not knowing how to propose. So, please give me notions to make him to fall in love. As you didn't say who is the guy you're in love... ...my wife is dubious on me. If you want to succeed in love, change your name 'Divya' as 'Kavya'. You must contact, Name, L. Perumagan MGR Nagar, Kundalakesi street, Chennai-78. Hey, you cheat... When asked for notion to love, you're fluorishing your business. Fear, ignorance, instinctive ability and shyness... ...these series of qualities are unique to a woman. But, you don't even have any one of these, you shameless. It's not you to be blamed, but your parents. Why are you disclosing in Facebook? And spoil your name? Aren't you afraid of your future ? Whom you'll get married and live peacefully, if you do so? I can live happily and peacefully. Because, I'm going to get married to you. If you marry me, not just peace, you can't live at all. You'll die... My parents had fixed a bride for me. We got engaged too. Both families exchange the plates of betel leaves. Both of you exchange the garlands. She is the right match for you. Look at uncle. He looks funny. Hello... Who decided the astrological match for them? We checked with an astrologer, he said that everything matches well. Jobless people took up astrology nowadays. That's why, everything goes wrong. What happened, Swamy? This horoscope has Nagadosha. ( A curse of the serpent) That too, it's intense. This dosha, affected the bride as soon as the engagement. What are you saying? This is your horoscope, isn't it? The dosha of your horoscope killed her. After the astrologer said that, I was taken back. After her death, I was guilty of myself. Even my friends will ask, Why I think like a mad? But, my pain will be felt, when they're in my stance. So, you're not going to get married, henceforth. No, I didn't mean that. I'll marry a girl who has the dosha like me. You know, many people roamed around me in my school and college days. Still now, many guys propose me. I'm not impressed on anyone. But, I became mad after seeing you. I just understood the reason for that. I too have the Naga dosha. What are you saying? That's why, It seems, I'm roaming around you... ...though you keep ignoring. Don't worry, We'll live happily ever. (Indistinct voices) Grandma! What, dear? Have you seen him? No, I didn't. Go and inquire there. Grandpa! I haven't seen him. Hello, Do you know him? Hey dude, he is our engineer. Show me. Yes, dude. Will you please tell me where he is? I'm searching for him for long time. Come on... Where? He is upstairs. Vikram! Vikram! Hey! Come on... Vikram! Vikram! -Hello... Hello... He is here. He is inside. Vikram! Where is Vikram? He is Vikram. No. Yeah, I'm Vikram. Listen me. Don't touch me. I plead you, please leave me. Hey, come on... Come on. Hey... Oh, no. Vikram! Don't do too much. Vikram! Don't do too much. -hey. Still how many people will you kill? Metamorphosing as serpent after sunset is your curse. But, you're transforming as serpent even if you become furious. The God who separated him from you knows when to unite. When? Don't be in hurry. He'll come in search of you. That time has come. Whenever, I ask you say the same thing. You know well, where he is. Please, don't hide. Please, don't hide. Tell me. Get up. Listen me. Please, don't hide. Tell me. Where he is? Tell me, Swamy. Where he is? You're hiding something. I don't know the reason. Oh, Lord Shiva! I'll find out, wherever he is! Get the blessings from all. (Chanting Mantras) No, they'll kill me. Lord, they must get divorced in two months. (Chanting Mantras) The snake! Oh, no...The snake! The snake! Anyone come for help! Oh, no...The snake! The snake! Oh, no...The snake! Anyone come for help! The snake! Anyone come for help! The snake! The snake! (Indistinct voices) The snake! The snake! The snake! Anyone come for help! The snake! Sarva! What happened? What happened, dear? What happened? Where is the snake? I had a dream like a snake is stinging me. Mom, leave us alone. You go, I'll take care. Okay, let them be alone. -Yeah, let him take care. Take care. Hey, who asked you to sleep in the first night? It's a dream, right? Leave it, dear. I'm sorry. For what? I lied that I've Naga dosham in my horoscope. To get married to you, I gave a fake horoscope. There is no Naga dosha in my horoscope. Sarva, I really love you so much. Though any dosha exists, it would only affect me. I decided to live happily with you, whatever happens. You're my happiness. I'm really sorry, Sarva. Forgive me. I'm so sorry. You've done a big mistake. Why the elders give importance for the horoscope? Do you think that Naga dosha is very simple. That too, it's intense! Now, her life is in perils. Okay, don't be afraid. By god's grace, every dosha has a remedy. Tell us, what to do? In Naganatha Swamy temple at Kodaikanal, A priest named, Anandha Siddhar will perform a pooja for you... ...if you refer my name. Then, an important information. You must avoid intimacy, till this pooja gets over. Swamy, I left angrily on that day. Who takes care other than you? I can't be idle without searching him? Leading the life as a woman at day and serpent at night is horrible. I bear everything with belief that I'll get to him. Everything is your fate. Why the fate which you mention, makes me to suffer? Each and every living being in this world, has to face this fate. As humans can speak,… …they named it as,"Fate" and are blabbering. If the fate has a form, everyone will be furious to kill that. If this fate, decides to destroy someone... Even the traitor can't do his worst. The same fate, if decides to give... Even the god can't do his best. Even the atheist, if he looks keen at his life, He'll feel the fate. Swamy, has anyone in this world suffered like me? Will anyone believe, if happened so? Fate has no grammar. Nothing will happen to believe and as desired. Only by experience, this can be felt. Yeah Swamy, when will I see him? As I said earlier, he is coming here. But, one thing. What's that, Swamy? He got married. He is coming with his wife. You mean, wife? Then, who am I? That's the past. When I'm alive, how can that be the past? Can you live with him? Think over yourself. He is the reason for this stance. You think over. It's good to forget him. That's the dharma. I lived like a princess, with people who served me. But, now with his thoughts, I'm wandering in the house, forest and bushes. When asked, you say it's fate...fate... Should this fate play with me? I'll show. I'll show this fate, who am I? You're aware about his marriage and hid to me. Now, you ask me to forget him and say that's the dharma. What's that dharma? Nagarani... Hey, seen the mist? Look there, it's nice. Awesome! it's superb. Come on, let's go inside. Hey, you? Is it you? Come inside... You said that I'm your wife in all your births. You still remember that? Shouldn't we both live happily together? Hey, who is she! What are you doing here? Who are you? I'm asking you, tell me. Forget him, henceforth. I'll kill you. Who? Vikram! I don't know. Ask in the reception. -Sarva! I'm coming. You'll be flat within ten minutes of taking this. Then, wonder at my performance. Good, no one is here. I'll go. Madam! Madam! The boy isn't there, that's why I came. Madam, you're faster than me. Bye, madam. Kalyanam, you're the luckiest. Yeah! No one has seen. If so, no one will doubt as I'm the manager. Oh, is this how it goes? He is not suppressing. Oh, no...she is killing me even after coming for honeymoon. What a beautiful legs! You've put down these legs! I've fallen on many legs, I can fall many times for this leg. The leg must be like this. How fair it is! Oh, no... Is it for me...? Is all these for me...? I feel shy, Kalyanam. Sorry, darling. I'm going to rape you, now. I feel ticklish. She looks fair! Glowing like gold! Her forehead is the silver moon! Her physique is the diamond mine! Golden mountain! A statue made of gold! Is it a dream or real? Goof, look at the job you're here for. Instead, thinking whether it's dream or real? Oh, no...is this the hands? It's so smooth as plaintain stem. I'm going to slip, when I touch, You're gifted! Being unconscious, Are you asking for kiss? As you wish, I'll start from the kiss. Hey, snake... -Hey, come on... Madam, are you a snake? Can't you see? Sorry, madam. (A musical line from movie "VIKRAM") Hey, first switch off the phone. Annoying ringtone. (A musical line from movie "VIKRAM") I switched it off, madam. If you reveal what happened here, I'll finish you off. The snake says punch dialogue! Shall I leave then, snake madam? Get lost. Thank you, snake madam. I'm leaving. She says, she'll finish off me. Who'll believe if I say, that a girl has transformed to snake? Hey, where did you go? I saw you going last night. I went throughout the night. When did you see me? You went the whole night? That's why, you're looking tired. I know, when you took the milk. Oh, is that? Then, will I get fruit salad for the snake? You saw me taking the milk. Did you see me coming out? Yes, I saw that too. I know, when you offered her a free room. You're a fraud. Did you see what happened inside? No...I'm not that kind of person. You got caught! Will you go today? She is inside. Is she inside? - Oh... Hey, she'll set right only after the sunset. Get in after the sunsets. She'll immediately be okay. I'll finish her, today. Madam, you're a beautiful demon. You look so beautiful! If I've met you earlier, I haven't married the devil, my wife. He feels similar to me. Madam, why are your hands changing? -Have you seen? Madam, you're transforming as a snake! Oh, no... Snake! Save me. Snake! Will you have desires, hereafter? Why can't we do like this? How? If we ask for a promise that it shouldn't sting... ...then it won't breach. Yeah. Why that now? It's good to get a promise from it. Get a promise? It'll transform as a snake only after sunset. If we go before that... What do you say? Who are you? Where are you from? Swamy, if he doesn't remember me? Yeah, there are chances for that too. If he doesn't remember you, don't worry. If you provoke his feelings, he'll definitely recall the memories. "Saiya...Saiya..." "Nakula...Nakula..." "Shall I melt on your shoulders?" "Mukila...Mukila..." "Shall I freeze along with you?" "Shall I search for you in my eyes?" "Shall I search...?" "Pop up to pilfer my love..." "Just a second is enough... It's enough..." "To mingle with me..." "Oh, no! When the pace elevates" "My hormones are sighing to tell tales..." "Somewhere the clouds merge each other..." "Immediately the drizzles caress..." "The time has come stricken..." "My dear...oh,my dear..." "If both our lips are locked my fasting will get over " "This moment will stop" "The space must reduce, The eyelids must close" "Shall I tie you as kattamaran?" "I don't have any plans to let you..." "Buried in lap...lie seduced... My mind swings away..." "Touching like a silk thread..." "The kisses mount up like a small mountain" "When the moon disappears, the fingers twine." "Rapidity of the nerves raise..." "My life...will it conjoin with you?" "The time has come stricken..." "Is this a wild flower?" "Has the lord Kama tasted the spirit?" "Oh, the breath..." "Getting hot when it touched..." "Get buried in my chest... Get freezed in my soul..." "The way to ecstasy...." "You...search it..." "Getting lost to me... Getting seduced to you..." "As the attire in between..." "You...change so..." "My life...will conjoin with you..." "The time has come stricken..." "Saiya...Saiya..." Oh, no... Before the dosha remedy, if we be intimate... ...that'll be endangering to your life, isn't it? I too behaved madly. The astrologer told me everything. It's a full moon day on coming Friday. If you do the remedy on that day, you'll be relieved on the whole. Come on that day. We're leaving, Swamy. In your entire life, every moment will burden you with his thoughts. That's my curse! Yeah, tell me. We're not here for honeymoon. We've come for some other work. You know that. When did she come? Oh.. Okay. Okay. Always busy with the phone. -okay. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, don't do like this. Hey, -no... Be quiet. Just a kiss. -what're you doing? See, what I'm going to do today? Hey, snake! Hey, go... Sarva! Snake! Someone come for help! Wait, don't get afraid. Where is the snake? -brother. Sarva! I've never seen such a big serpent in my life. I'm very much afraid, Swamy. Don't be afraid. Tomorrow is the full moon day. As I said, do the remedy. Swamy, nothing will happen to her by that time, isn't it? Don't worry. God is there. No spirit can do anything. I'll show who this Nagarani is! This is why, I'm not conveying you anything. Don't be afraid, mom. I'm fine. Just now he went out. He'll come back, mom. Don't worry unnecessarily. The snake! The Snake! Sarva! Sarva! Sarva! Someone help! The snake! Drag it. Be careful. Don't leave. Drag it. Be careful. Sarva! Drag it! Drag it! Don't leave. Don't leave. Drag it. Oh no, Sarva! Be careful. I've never seen such a furious snake in my life. Be careful. Nothing... Few years ago. Happy Bus day! Take the cake. -No, I don't want. I don't like. -Have it. Take now. -No. Just leave, if she doesn't like. Give in front. You go. Won't you celebrate "Bus day" in your college? We'll celebrate, boss. Give to those at front. You take it. Take it. Why should we brawl among ourselves? Go away. Will you hit me? Hit me. -we're telling you. Hold this. Hit me. Hit me. What are you looking at? Do you know who am I? No one has touched me so far. Dude. But, he had hit me. I expected that you'll thrash him, Instead you flee. Don't worry, dude. We'll ask Jayanthpuram Marudhu to behead him. Why to expect Marudhu? I'll go to his college tomorrow and behead him. Don't ever study. Always get notes from me. What? What happened? Why are you hiding? What happened? -don't talk. Hey, superb! Superb! Dude, the one who hit us in the bus has come to our college. What are you saying? He is a dead meat, today. Search for him, everywhere. -Okay, dude. Hey, look there. Go and see. Dude, he is not here. Don't leave him. He is not here. Come on. -Clear out. Hurry up. How did you come here? Just to see you. What are you saying in everyone's presence? What's there in it? Go... I told you to go. Where to go? Hey. See there. Has the guy who fought yesterday in the bus came here? Tell us. No, he didn't... He shouldn't leave the college today. Close the main gate. -okay. Come... -come... Go... They didn't leave yet. Get in. -go fast... Where are you taking me? Clear out. -Go away. Oh, no... they're coming. Hey, hurry up. Don't let him to escape. They're coming... Hold now. They're coming... That's it. You won't be afraid of them. You came for this, right? Leave now. I love you. Do you want to be alive or not? Okay, brother. Thrash it. Break it. Break the tape recorder. Hey, break the tape recorder. -don't hit us, brother. Thrash everything. -Don't damage. Break their limbs. To whom? What are you thinking about us? Mom, you go that side. -hit them. Hit him. Hit him. His shop shoudn't be there. -hit him... Smash them. We shoudn't see his face again in this locale. This shop shouldn't be here. Why did you come here? To meet you. Leave from here. Why are you asking me to leave? Don't play without knowing the problem. Go away from here. Tell me, "I love you" I'll leave then. Tell me. Who are you? -grandma. I'm asking you, Who are you? Is there a gas stove in your home? Yes...but, why? I've a product to save the fuel. It's a fraud company, isn't it? What you say is a different company. It's a branded one. Branded one? Then, it's good. Yes, grandma. If you show me the kitchen, I'll install it. Come, I'll show... Hey, you get inside. -Go... Will you leave me? Grandma. Come inside. It's very simple, grandma. How is it? Wow! good density of flame! Yeah, it's a good company. Grandma, why it's crowded outside? That is... The guy in the opposite cycle shop was teasing my grand daughter... ... playing the songs, whenever she crosses. I told my younger son. He brought few people and thrashed the shop. What's that song, grandma? Dear, what's that song where the word,"floret" is stretched? Grandma, can't you keep quiet? She won't allow me to say. -"Oh floret..." "Why this silence...?" Be quiet. "Why this silence...?" -hey, stop it. You too sing the same. How much? It's okay, grandma. You are a sales person, right? Yeah, grandma. But, you look similar to my maternal grandma. So, let it be a free service. You're an innocent. Take this ten rupees. Give this money in home instead spending unnecessarily. Okay, grandma. You too don't spend lavishly. Keep it safe. Dude, just a minute. Who are you? He is from the gas company. Okay, go. Dude, where are you from? Goripalayam. Then? Hey, your beau is waiting. Be quiet. Okay, I'll leave as my beau will be waiting. Thank you. Don't you know that I'm your beau... ...when all your friends know? Don't you've a desire to get married and stay with a family? That's why, I came to meet you. They'll kill you. Do you know, who is my father? Your native place is Sivagangai. Your father is the head of Palaiyampatti. He is the police station and the court of the surrounding villages. More honour killings has occurred there... ...and your father is the reason. Do you love me after knowing everything? I fell in love when not aware of these. Now, it's known. Can I leave you for that sake? Even the animals can't fall in love, if there is no restraint. The happiness when I saw, I never felt so far. I wish this happiness ever stay in my life. What are you saying? Hey, Malar... Stop there. Thrash him. -Stop there. No, Vikram. Leave my hand. Vikram... Hey, stop there. Don't come behind me. Go. I'm asking you to stop, but you keep going. I said a lot to you, but you went. Are you so courageous? Then, if a problem happens before me, Should I remain silent? If I didn't go, they would've killed that cop... If you had died? I would've been a corpse. Hey, Malar... I'm coming. Malar... What did you say yesterday? What did you say? As you'll be a corpse? I didn't sleep last night. Why did you say so? Tell me. Why did you say so? Malar... Someone might see. Tell me. "I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..." "I'm almost lost..." "In search of me... oh, my lass" "I'm getting lost... I'm getting lost..." "I'm almost lost... " "In search of me... My handsome" "It's sweetening in the heart" "Has the relationship came in search of you?" "The heart beats slowly..." "Has the life came in search of me? "I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..." "I'm almost lost..." "In search of me... oh, my lass" "I'm getting lost... I'm getting lost..." "I'm almost lost... " "In search of me... My handsome" "I'll adore the spots wherever you kissed" "I'll think whether any spot is leftover?" "I'll spend the whole night in the warmth of your body" "You've lit the fire in my body with all your shyness" "You've done something to me, caressing a lot" "You made me to live with your love" "You're the goddess, my dear" "It's you..." "I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..." "I'm almost lost..." "In search of me... oh, my lass" "I got lost in your thoughts throughout the day" "I got melted in your beautiful body without parity" "I'm going to articulate with you with both lips" "I'll walk as your legs without crossing your words" "I'll bear your love, gestating" "Dear, we both will live together for many births" "We'll live ever..." "I'm getting lost...I'm getting lost..." "I'm almost lost..." "In search of me... oh, my lass" Sir, that floor... This house. Vikram. Sir, come in. -It's okay. I came to convey an information. A clan came with weapons on that day. That's why, I came chasing them. When investigated about them, It was known that they've come to kill you. To kill me? Sir, why must they kill me? Will they let you go easily, if you're in love... ...with the Zamindar's daughter? They've transferred me for arresting them. Be careful. I told to kill the guy who is roaming behind you. Later, I was known that it's you too roaming with him. How dare you're! Hey, attend the phone. Who's that? Boss, he isn't found anywhere. But, we'll kill him by night. Kill him and bury, the moment you see. Don't come back without finding him. No, dad. No, dad. I'll obey whatever you say. Leave him, dad. It's a mistake to allow you to stay in Madurai for studies. Hit her hard. She has done a mistake unknowingly. - hey, leave me. Is it the way to bring up a girl? I won't even meet him, hereafter. How strong your love is! I must see who is that great person? Hey, bring him wherever he is. Hey... Come on... Dad! -come. Go. I told you to come. -go. Go inside. You made us ashamed. -dad! Get lost. She made our family embarrassed. -dad. How dare you love someone and weep now? Hey, he is going to the first floor. Come on. Hey, who are you? Leave my grand daughter. Oh, my ghosh! He took her with him. My family's honour is in perils. Hey, catch him. -catch him. Don't let him escape. It's a boon to live with a person close to heart. That's why, she eloped from the house. But, that's not a boon. The destiny has shown her that was a curse. To get relieved of the curse, Itchadaris come to Naganathaswamy temple on auspicious full moon day... ...to take the miraculous nuptial thread. Taking that nuptial thread is a big bravodo. On that day, the fate made her life gruesome. "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "The only floret, as the only breeze..." "You come along, my dear." "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "Here the stars are recasted as eyes and looking us," "To safeguard me, not to become a temple statue.” "Let your eyes play on me." "Get a chariot for the stars to look us" "I'll dance, if Lord Kannan recites the Geetha" "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "I'll dance, heeding the sounds of the bell" "This rainy clouds will dance on you," "Let's be intimate with colorful countenance," "This orchard will stay close to you" "New gushes... heaven on my side... Nothing else..." "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "The only floret, as the only breeze..." "You come along, my dear." "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." "The only soul, as a single-hearted..." "You come along, my dear." Hey... Hey... Come on, let's take bath. Let's go. Hey... What happened? If your father had arranged your marriage, All the VIP's would've attended the marriage. The entire Madurai would've sported a festive look. Instead of someone tying the nuptial knot in the midst of the crowd, Though, no one is here... I'm happy with this nuptial thread. This happiness must persist in our entire life. Definitely. Not only in this birth, in all the births... ... I'll be with you. Hey... Leave it. Leave my nuptial thread. Malar, you stay inside. Vikram! Deva... Deva... Deva... Deva... Hey... For twenty five years, we've been suffering... ...as serpents in nights and humans at day. Atleast, we would've lived together hereafter, but you killed him. Why did you kill him? Why did you kill him? I swear, I don't know that he is your husband. We eloped from the house and got married. The men sent by my father... Vikram! In your next birth, you'll suffer like me... ...as a serpent and human. Every moment of your life will be a burden with his thoughts. It's my curse! Divya. Divya. What, dear? Will you come out for a drive? You go... I'll buy the pooja things. Okay, you take rest. I saw you earlier at the hotel. You came in search of someone. I saw... Why are you starring at the temple? I feel like I've seen it already. You might've come before. It's the first time I'm coming to Kodaikanal. Then, you would've seen in your previous birth. You mean, previous birth? You say that you haven't come here. Then, how you feel that you've seen this temple earlier? Might be, you got married in this temple. What's that you're making fun? Do you believe in astrology? In the horoscope, the fifth place is meant for last birth's deeds. Do you know that? -I don't know. Matsya(The fish), Kurma(The tortoise), Varaha(The boar), Narasimha,(The lion man)... ...Vamana(The dwarf), Parasurama(The lumbar jack), Rama, Krishna, Balarama, Kalki(The horse man)... ...when the god who created you has ten incarnations, won't you have? I'm doing research on last births. I say with confidence, that you and a girl got married... ...in the same temple, in your last birth. What's that you're saying? Like you, she is also somewhere in this birth. I'll show you all the places you both roamed around. Then, you'll definitely remember everything. That too before the sunset. Will you come? Okay, come. Just a minute. Naganathaswamy, he tied the nuptial thread before you. You must conjoin us. Okay, let's go. Stop it. -here only. Is it here? -yeah, here. Hello, Sarva. He is mine. You forget him. Hey, who are you? You've visited this place often with your girl in the last birth. During one of your visits, You had written both of your names in this tree... ... and shown her by holding the hands. It's that tree. Did you see my husband? No, I didn't see. You said, you'll live with her for seven births. Wonderful love! Love should be like this. Isn't it? But, I don't feel that I wrote all these. It's getting late, let's leave. Come on. Is the priest there? No. This place only. Stop the car. Do you remember this place? Do you remember the big fight that occured on that day? This place? That guy banged you, do you remember? All these wasn't there, then. Do you remember? What are you saying? I can't understand anything. This is the place where you and that girl... ...got married and were coming by car. A kind of serpent called Itchadari is there. On that day, it took the humanoid form and killed you both. The serpent took the humanoid form and killed us. What else that serpent did? It's the truth. Believe me. Don't blabber. My wife is alone in the room. I must go soon. Get into the car. I'll drop you where you want. Simply telling tales as serpent and human. There is a limit for cheating too. Saying as last birth and next birth... Humans have only one birth. Don't tell lies. Hello... Are you coming or not? If you're not coming, I'll leave you here and go. Don't irritate me. Sir, a small accident occured. Nothing happened to them. But, a small damage to the vehicle. I left it to the mechanic at the foot hills. He asked me to come after two hours. That's why, I brought them here. It has become a nuisance with you. It's routine for you making accidents. Shit. Better to expel you from the job. Sorry, sir. Oh, no! You're looking the same when I saw you twenty five years ago. Did you go to Himalayas? Or bought medicines from Siddhars? Sir, what are you speaking about? Sir, I don't know who you're. You don't know me. I'm watching you for twenty five years. Sir, come in... I took photos of many people. But, the photo which impressed me is this one. You've modified in Photoshop and both of you're cheating me. You shouldn't be spared. Sir... Sir... -Vikram... Sir, believe me. -Vikram... Sir, your phone was in the car. Take it. Thank you. Vikram, it's us who were in that photo. Please, believe me. Vikram, What I say is fact. Believe me. Hey, what do you want now? I want you. I want only you. Hello... I was waiting for you, all these days. -Hello! Vikram! -Sarva! Vikram! I want you. -hey, leave... Sarva! Where are you? Vikram! I want you. -hello. -Hello. -leave my leg. Sarva! Hey... Vikram! Hey... Vikram! Where are you? Malar! Malar! Vikram! Vikram! Where were you all these days? - Vikram! Swamy, I'm very much afraid from the moment that girl spoke. She is not a girl, but a serpent! The serpent which was awaiting for twenty five years... ...to get your husband. Now, your husband has got caught by an Itchadhari serpent. Within short time, that Itchadhari will conjoin with your husband. If that happens, he'll transform as an Itchadhari serpent. We've come to you as my life was in danger. Now, how should I save him, if his life is in danger? There is only one way to save your husband. Swamy, tell me. These Itchadhari serpents will spew the poison... ...at the time of getting relieved from the curse. When consuming this poison and blown on it... ...only then, the Itchadhari will die. Only by the poison of the Itchadhari serpent, another Itchadhari can be killed. But, there's no chances of being alive after consuming this poison. If you want to survive, that can be possible... ...by the grace of this god. Hey, where...? Where are you going? Oh, Lord Shiva! What have you done? He came for my sake. I won't go without him. This sacred thread will guard you. You've to kill her when she is in humanoid form. If she transforms as serpent, even god can't kill her. Go fast. If they both be intimate, he can't be saved. "On your matchstick like looks, I'm roused...I'm roused..." "Because of the hot love I'm ruffled...I'm ruffled..." "Hey, the goddess of euphoria has come to me..." "She swayed all the five sense organs" "She shot the arrrow with her lightning eyes" "She caressed my heart with her breath" "I was standing in the vicinity of your eyes" "I came to hold your hands..." "When I touch you, where does the fake smile go?" "To acquire your body, To fulfill my needs" "The attire will go off Go ahead with your lust..." "Will you come to touch me, with the fire on your fingers!" "The fragrance rainbow, will you bestow all your colours?" "The youthness of my life, Blaze in your breath perdiem" "You're my night bed, My lust pours out on it" "When the eyes of the libertine fell on you" "You called me to bathe in the honey" "I'm the amorous honey garden, Squeeze me the whole night" "Your springtide relieves my fasting" "Come and serve me..." "Come on... Why are you hesitating?" "Come promptly to feed your hunger" "On your matchstick like looks, I'm roused...I'm roused..." Hey... Sarva! Hey, who are you? Are you asking me? What happened to you? Who are you? I'm Vikram. Vikram! Sarva! I don't know, who you're! Leave me. Sarva! why are you talking like this? I'll slap you. Hey, he is not your Sarva. My Vikram. What did you say? Hey, leave her. Sarva! What do you want? Who are you? Get lost. I won't leave you without killing. Oh, no! Naganatha! We came here with faith on you. Divya! On that day, after your death... ...I've become an Itchadhari on the curse of the other Itchadhari. I didn't reveal it to you, fearing you might leave me. I eloped with you leaving my parents and everything. The only reason is my love on you... But today, I'm living feared of the eagle, mongoose, dog and the jackal. The only reason is my love on you... I haven't done any sinful deed. But, I'm suffering. I'm watching you. You're acting like a goof. Hey... What's this? An Itchadhari serpent can be killed only by the poison of the same kind. What, dear? That's why, I consumed the poison. Divya! Hey, Divya! Divya, open your eyes. Divya! Divya, what happened to you? Divya, open your eyes. Divya! Hey... I'm living today, feared of the eagle, mongoose, dog and the jackal. The only reason is my love on you... Forgive me. After seeing your transformation as a serpent... ...I got belief in last birth. She is ready to sacrifice her life for me. I can't live without her. If you want to kill her, better kill me first... ...and then kill her. Hey... Divya! Divya! I was dead, the moment you decided to live with her. I died for you, in the last birth. Even in this birth, I'm dying for you. At least, in next birth, I must live with you...
