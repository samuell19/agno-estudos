Cinema Service Presents A Taewon Entertainment Production We're through. But why, Mi-young? Don't whine! Let's not be melodramatic, okay? Listen to me. I know I'm not the kind of guy most girls dreams of. I'm not rich and don't have a flashy future ahead of me, but... That's what I hate! I want a rich man with a great future. Mi-young, don't do this. You know how much I love you. I've never cheated on you. That doesn't help. Am I the only girl on earth? Mi-young, please... Tell me what you want. I'll change. My heart has changed. You just don't excite me anymore. Should I cheat to excite you? Come on, don't overdo it. If you leave me... I will kill myself. Go ahead! You call yourself a man? Bye! Mi-young... -You really broke up? -Yes! He begged me to stay. You're the one who cheated. Why should he beg? Because he was the one who didn't want to break up. When will you stop breaking hearts? When I find a man to break mine! You're unbelievable, Mi-young. You're way too picky. That's shopping, not love. Shopping isn't love. But love is like shopping. You shop around for a deal. Sometimes you have to try it on before you purchase it. You're still a virgin, aren't you, Sun-young? Hey! For a 27-year-old girl, virginity isn't just a decoration. There's no age limit, is there? How will you ever find love? You need a man for that, but you never date. Love comes... Love comes like thunder, or like a thief? When will the thunder rumble? When will the thief break in? Still waiting for a prince on a white horse? Princes don't like your type. Take Snow White, Cinderella... ...and Sleeping Beauty. Snow White was a tramp, fooling around with 7 dwarves. Cinderella crashed a party to hook up with a prince. And Sleeping Beauty met one while sleeping in the woods. It's not some prince I want. But... Yes, a thrill! The nerve cells coming alive... and all the senses converge into one part of the body... You know what that's called? What? An orgasm! Come on! What's this? A mushroom. What does it look like? Like a mushroom. You know what else it looks like? Look. Going in and out like this... it takes the impurities out of a girl's body. Sex is good for a girl's cleanliness. That's nonsense! I read it in the paper. Sexless girls... They run a higher risk of getting uterine cancer. -Really? -Yes! So it's unhealthy to live without sex like you do. Smells great! Mom. Isn't this mushroom soup? -That's right. -What?! What's wrong with you? So lewd! Lewd? Why is soup lewd? Of all soups, you had to make mushroom soup? What's wrong with it? Whatever! I'm not eating it. Why so bitchy this morning? You'd rather eat clam soup? What clam... Has she started her period? No. Everybody Has Secrets Not a single hottie tonight. Where's my Mr. Hunk? Too cheesy. Wow! He has style. He's cute and sexy. He's perfect. Just my type. Hey, get away from him! I saw him first. Ready to order? The singer takes orders too? It depends. Here's the menu. What the heck is he doing? I'm ashame Is he one of those wine-sipping stuck-ups? Be a man and go for tequila. A bottle of tequila please. Oh, you like tequila? Anything to go with it? What do you recommend? We have great steaks. Very juicy. Fruit please. How'd he know I hate yes-men? "Only the last love of a woman can satisfy the first love of a man." -Balzac I should go work on him. Here. -Leaving? -Yes. I had a good time. Can I have your business card? So I can invite you when we throw parties. Hold on. Mr. Naive, huh? That's my number. -Thanks. -Bye. You're a good singer. Thanks. Bye. Sun-young, it's the feeling. I knew he was THE one the moment I saw him. You say that about every guy that you meet. It's real this time! He's on his way. -Here? -Yeah, he's picking me up. Wow, yummy! My mother liked these. So I got some for you. Nice to meet you. -Su-hyeon, right? -Yes. Let me introduce my family. Jin-young, my first daughter. -How are you? -Pleased to meet you. Her husband. He's a doctor. -Hi, I'm Choi Su-hyeon. -Good to meet you. Good thing you're a doctor. I've been needing a checkup. I'm a gynecologist. She's Ye-sul, my granddaughter. -Hi. -Hi. -Su-hyeon, I'll be right back. -Okay. You have beautiful eyes, Ye-sul. You too. I do? Thanks. -Su-hyeon, come here. -Okay. Dae-young, my youngest child. Sun-young, my second daughter. She's a bookworm. Su-hyeon Mom, where's Su-hyeon? -Sorry to keep you waiting. -No problem. -Are you ready? -Let's go. See you later. -Bye, Mom. -Come by anytime. It was nice meeting you. He's gorgeous, isn't he? Yeah. Nothing like those guys you usually date. He's not just different. He's like a character in a novel. I think he reads a lot too. Like what? He quoted Ko Jung-hee. When did you guys talk? While you were upstairs. Not many know that poet. Gosh, he's cute and intelligent. Isn't he too perfect? He seems very nice, but... You know what? Don't trust him too much. Why not? Guys all seem nice at first. But as time goes by, they change. No way! I like him more each day. All I am saying is... Not everything is what it seems. Sun-young, are you jealous? Give me a break. Why would I be jealous? She's not even capable ofjealousy. What if she finds out that I'm in love like a lightning bolt? Am I going to see some love this time? I don't know. By the way, how about you? What? Is sex still good? You know what he says? "No sex with a wife." He says it feels almost like committing incest. He looks at naked women all day at the hospital. I bet he doesn't want to see one at home. -Want to come in? -No, I have to go. -Go ahead. -Okay. Bye, Jin-young. Su-hyeon. -Mi-young. -Huh? I don't want to hide my feelings any more. Don't. You shouldn't. Honestly... I want to have you. But only when you're ready. -I was just playing innocent. -Whenever... Keep going! Wherever you want it. Heartbreaking What's wrong with him? He's so moody. Everything's wrong with him. He doesn't know how to win a girl's heart. Mi-young. -What? -You know what? You don't have to come back to me. But can't you be nicer to me? It'll only make things worse for you. I know. I really do. But it's just so hard. Please, warm my heart. Please. Are you sure? Warm now? God... hot... Jin-young, you just got home? Did Su-hyeon leave? Hi, Mi-young. Hi, Su-hyeon. What were you doing? I was about to leave I'm almost done here. Can you pick me up? Ok, Coming Soon Okay. Can you believe it? I've never felt this way about anybody before. You know what we did last weekend? Great Date? I was kidnapped. Oh my Godness What's going on? Su-hyeon, where are we going? It won't be fun if I tell you. I'll take care ofyou today. To the right. Taken somewhere blindfolded... I was so excited! Get in. Watch your legs. Feeling the speed with my eyes blindfolded... It was awesome! Like having an orgasm, my whole body tingled. I was going crazy! The place he took me... It was a beautiful cottage overlooking the sea. So romantic, isn't it? What girl would say no in such a situation? He didn't just give me love. For the first time... he made me feel destined to love. Thank you! I have my whole family here tonight. It's my mom's birthday. Thank you. To me, she's my best friend. I'm wondering what to get her for her birthday... -Hey. -What? Chicks like jewelry and clothes, don't they? Not our boss, moron. She's been a widow for 10 years. What she needs is a young stud. A young stud?! I've decided to present her with a new family member. See that good-looking man sitting by my mom? She's crazy about him. And so is he about her. With a 10-year widow... he's done for. He's the man I'm in love with. She's giving her mom her boyfriend? They must be real close, sharing a guy. Wait, wait. I haven't asked him yet. But I will now. Su-hyeon. Will you marry me? She's an lndian giver! That's what happens when they share guys. Oh, I see. You don't know shit! No, this isn't right. Shouldn't I be the one proposing? Mi-young, will you marry me? "Love appears like thunder and disappears like fog." -Doppler Hi. Hi. I've heard a lot about you. You have? Ingeborg Bachmann, right? What? He knows her? Ifyou like Bachmann, you must like Ko Jung-hee, too. You know her, too? I love her poems. "invocation of the spirit of a deceased" "Spring in Mt. Jiri" "Everything That Disappears Leaves Emptiness Behind" Few people know those poems. You're a lover of poetry? Yes. Have you read any plays by Bachmann? My favorite is... "The Good God of Manhattan." I heard you're writing your Master's thesis. I'm working on it. What's it going to be about? The periodical characteristics of poems. But I haven't decided on the period yet. Better yet... Why don't you focus on one thing? Like brothel literature. Brothel... You mean prostitutes? But all they wrote about was men and their... Some lived provocative and sexually active lives. Like who? It's your job to find out. Use your imagination. That imaginative power ofyours that nobody knows of. Mom, where's Su-hyeon? Sorry to keep you waiting. -Are you ready? -Let's go. See you later. -Bye, Mom. -Come by anytime. It was nice meeting you. What's he doing here? What am I doing? I didn't do anything wrong. Sun-young? Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? That book we talked about... What? "The Good God of Manhattan." I heard this library carries it. I see. You're here for your thesis? I come here often. -What? -I meant yes! You were... gone like the wind. My father liked this song. 'Una Furtiva Lagrima.' It's an aria from L'Elisir d'Amore by Donizetti. I don't... Thanks. When I was eleven... I caught my father crying, listening to this. You're confused, aren't you? I was very much so back then. He was a sentimental person. When I turned 1 8... he told me to get a driver's license. So I did. When I came home with my license, this car was there... But my father was gone. What? Gone where? He'd disappeared. Without... Without a word... I... I miss him so much. Don't cry. Not a word from him since. He must've died somewhere alone. That makes me sad. I miss my daddy too! "You stole my heart like a thief." "Do you realize that?" Come on, he's not a thief! "Su-hyeon,join our family and..." Fool! What are we, the mob?! "You wetly drenched my heart like streaks of rain..." God, it's so corny! It failed me. My brain failed me. Have you gone insane? Huh? Stop eating my soup. Eat yours. You have to stop reading books. Get a date or something. See how happy Mi-young is with Su-hyeon. Should I set you up with my friend's son? He's a neurologist. You mixed rice in the soy sauce! He smokes pot and dances with the phantom of his dead lover? I never knew classical ballet could be so twisted. Marijuana is just a device to portray the suppressed desires... and the sufferings resulting from them. You don't get it? Yeah, too deep for me. What the... Since when? Been a while. -You're gonna smoke that? -No way. It's just for show. Oh my God! My professor is here! What should I do? I'll be back. Professor? -Oh, you're early. -Yes. The topic ofyour thesis changed dramatically. I was quite surprised. You don't like it? That's not it. I was wondering what made you change your mind. The shifting of one's thoughts being like thunder... ...or like a thief. When Nikiya gets bitten by a poisonous snake... she refuses to love the Brahman in return for the antidote. What do you mean it's a prearranged choice? Loving a man she shouldn't, she risks her life. To liberate her suppressed ego... she chooses death, giving up her physical body. Look. That's what makes her love so beautiful. That's an amazing interpretation. Only by becoming truthful to her desire for love... does she achieve true love. Sun-young! Wait! What do you think? So pretty. Will he be okay with it? It's quite revealing. He won't be okay with the price. -Sun-young! -Yikes! I just saw Su-hyeon. Where? He went upstairs, but he's coming back down. He gestured that he would. That's good. I haven't seen him for a while. Wait. Why isn't he coming? He must be busy shopping. He said he'd come right down. Why are you fidgeting? Why isn't he coming?! Sun-young! You're standing in the way. Let go. What's wrong with you? What's going on? He told me he'd come down! I can't believe him! Where the hell is he?! Sun-young! You know, Su-hyeon is... Him again? Doesn't he seem to have a sad past? Like Werther or Hamlet... he's a man of a pure soul... Iiving in his sorrow. -Well, I think... -I'm right! You're married and incapable of feeling such sentiment. When he cried... he looked so sad. He cried? You saw him crying? No... I'm just guessing. You met him, didn't you? What?! You think I'm seeing him behind Mi-young's back? Why are you getting upset? Did I say you did? But it sounded like... ...you did. Just eat, okay? -What are you doing? -God! Hey! Why so surprised? Where are you manners? You should've knocked! I'm your sister. I can't come in without knocking? It's called 'privacy'! Stop yelling at me. Who were you talking to? Why does that concern you? To the dog next door, so what?! Why do I always have to yield to you? Food, clothes... I even have to use the bathroom after you! What's wrong with you? I won't yield anymore. Sun-young! What's wrong? What did you say to her? Nothing. I was just going to tell her that it's raining. What's her problem? Hello? Sun-young? How'd you know it was me? I've been waiting for your call. You saw me at the department store, didn't you? Yes, I did. What happened? You gestured you would come down. Where are you? It's not important! It is. -Can you come over now? -What? It will keep you warm. I don't drink. Have some tea then. I'll drink it. I think a lot about you. Really? Once... Never mind. What is it? No, I shouldn't tell you. Come on! Tell me. You'll think badly of me once I do. I won't. Tell me what it is. I promise I won't, okay? Please tell me what it is. We're cool, aren't we? You can tell me anything. I mean it! Making love to Mi-young... I wished she'd been you. See? I shouldn't have said it. -Wait a second. -Sure. Believe it or not... I've never done it before. But... We can kiss some more. Sleep well? Good morning! -You feel better now? -Sure. Sorry about last night. I'm glad you are. Mi-young, are things good with Su-hyeon? I think so. But he's been strange lately. Why? Has he changed? That's not it. I often find him lost deep in thought. And he sometimes stares at me without saying a single word. Keep your eyes on him. He might cheat on you. You know he'd never do that. -This is it. -Right, he'd never do that. Mi-young, this is reality. Try to embrace it. Su-hyeon doesn't love you any more. You can drink this. Oh God... -Sun-young, eat! -Jesus! Okay! Aren't you eating? No way! Where are you taking me? It won't be fun if I tell you. To the right. I will take care ofyou today. I'm so curious. Watch your legs. Are you good? Su-hyeon, where are we going? Where are you? Are you there? I can't wait. Tell me where we're going. Don't keep me guessing. If you don't answer me now, I'll take this off. Let's go. Where are we going? See that good-looking man sitting by my mom? She's crazy about him. So is he about her. He's the man I'm in love with. Wait, wait. I haven't asked him yet. Su-hyeon. Will you marry me? No, this isn't right. Shouldn't I be the one proposing? Mi-young, will you marry me? Don't do this, Sun-young. Go. You should be with your fiancee. -Sun-young. -Everything's clear now. I love you, but you're marrying Mi-young. I'm left with a broken heart. You're an asshole! Sun-young. What was I thinking?! After you stepped into my life, everything got mixed up. It's a total mess! Sun-young. Calm down and listen. Do you think you can love only one person? Solor marries Princess Gamzati. So he doesn't love Nikiya? This isn't some novel. This is reality. Do you love Mi-young? I do. Let me ask you one thing. Answer me carefully. Did you want to marry me? Were you just having fun with me? I had to say what I said. But what really counts is... It's my heart. Leaving Mi-young alone... I'm with you at this very moment. Can't you see that? Are you... Sun-young! I'll do it. What's next? -Should I turn off the light? -No! Don't. I can wait. We'll do it when you're ready. Turn off the light. Relax. Loosen up. Okay. Oh God! What? Do I have to do this? You're supposed to? I think so. It gives guys pleasure. Says who? I read it in a book. Come here. You were fantastic. Really? Really! You liked it? Did you? Was it the same as described in the book? Are you making fun of me? Forget about the book. Follow your feelings this time. Again? Too much sex isn't good for men. -The book says so? -Yes. When guys ejaculate, they lose protein. Ejaculating is like running a lap around the track... or playing hoops for 15 minutes... Sun-young. You don't have to do it every time we have sex. Oh... I don't? What? Sun-young. Not coming? What do you think makes life fun? It's just fun, and it's raining! Mi-young didn't come home the other night. She didn't? This guy she's been seeing took her to an island. To an island? Why? Isn't it obvious? What do you think they did? That's all you think about. You're like a pervert. Come on, it's not a crime. They're adults. So are we. No way. No sex before marriage. Never! We live in the 21 st century. Virginity isn't a big deal anymore. Don't even think about it! What? Nothing. Problems with your girlfriend? God, you're good! You like her, don't you? Sure, absolutely. But... Can I call you "brother"? After you zip up your fly. When I suck on her neck... her legs shake like crazy. Like a dog wagging its tail when you touch its neck. And when we were alone the other day... she let me touch her tits. That was it. Nothing more. She wouldn't let me touch her down there. So I told her in such a romantic way. Romantically... "Eun-mi, I love you." "l wanna show you my love... " "... in every possible way." That's a good line, isn't it? You're bad. How about this? "Although I want to show you my love... " "I'll wait until your heart opens." Better, isn't it? What if it never opens? Then... "l can wait for eternity." "I'm just happy being with you." That will do it. Can you write that down for me? Better yet, help me get laid. Wash your hands. You'll help me, won't you? Here you go. When did you learn to cook? You're so cool. Here. I'm not much of a drinker. You call yourself a man? Finish it! God! You know how I like it. Fill it up please. I'll sleep on the couch. That's right! You like sleeping on the couch. I totally forgot. Let me get you a blanket. Brother... Am I a monster? Or... Do I smell that bad? She'd rather sleep on the couch than in the bed with me. Can you believe that? But she seems to like you as much as you like her. -You think so? -Yes. What's her problem then? Be patient. You can't force her into it. Love is a delicate thing. "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink." Abraham Lincoln. Good analogy! You've got a better shape than I thought. Your chest is so muscular. You've got six-pack abs... Not. Geez, what's up with this? You're attractive. Ack, I'm getting a semi-stiffy. So tight. "Only the brave win the beauty." Am I becoming gay? Oh God! I think I'm going to bed. Want to drink some more with me? No, I'm beat. You're a bed hog. I like sleeping on the edge. Sleep tight, Dae-young. See! Come sleep closer to this side. I'm okay. I like sleeping on the floor. Sorry, Eun-mi... I think I love someone else. Crazy wench! What a flatter! That bastard! He turned me gay Daeyoung I didn't know you were that sweet. Why didn't you tell me? What? Su-hyeon told me everything. I never knew how much you cared for me. I think I'm ready... ...to open my heart to you. It's okay. It hurts the first time. I did it! You have something to tell me? It's nothing serious, but... Any problems with my sis? Problems... Like what? Do you guys keep things from each other? Is there a couple on earth without secrets? Why? Nothing. Let's drink. -Hi. -Where's my mom? She's out, but will be back soon. "Oh, Freedom! What sins are done in your name!" -Rolland Romain What do you think? So pretty. Will he be okay with it? It's quite revealing. He won't be okay with the price. -Hello? -lt looks good on you. Who's this? You have a beautiful neck. Stop wearing turtlenecks. Who is this?! I'm sorry. This is Choi Su-hyeon. Who? Su-hyeon. Ring a bell? Oh, Mi-young's boyfriend? How'd you know I was here? I'm here too, watching you as we speak. From where? It looks great on you. Buy it. Su-hyeon, wait. -Jin-young! -Yikes! I just saw Su-hyeon. Where? He went upstairs, but he's coming back down. He gestured that he would. That's good. I haven't seen him for a while. Wait. Why isn't he coming? How long was he watching me? I have a beautiful neck? Hi. You showering at night scares me. But wearing a perfume in bed? That's worse Come on! I bought this for the party. What do you think? Isn't it too revealing? I was told it looked good on me. It lets my neck stand out. Don't let it go to your head. The sales person just wanted to sell you that dress -And Su-hyeon... -What? Why so surprised? I didn't hear you. That means you're getting old. Did you clean your ears? You're so disgusting. What about him? Su-hyeon is... I think he's pretty loaded for his age. Ask him to invest in my hospital. The shower? Aren't you doing it? Is she in bed? Let me go check on her. This is Su-hyeon's gallery. It's nice. -Do you want to come in? -No, I have to go. -Go ahead. -Okay. Bye, Jin-young. Wow! Who are you? Are you my wife? Drunk already? What's wrong with me? You look so hot tonight. Let's get it on. Stop it. They're right there! Stop drinking! Honey, let's do it tonight. Pull yourself together! "No sex with a wife," remember? That's right. I wasn't myself for a moment. Guess I'm drunk. Sorry, ma'am. Bored, aren't you? No, I'm having fun. Did you buy that dress? You have a perfect body for it. Come on, moms don't have perfect bodies. I mean it. You're the sexiest of the three. I know you're joking. I hear you're going to a party on Friday. Should I baby-sit Ye-sul? What? -No, you don't have to. -It's okay. Ye-sul and I are friends now. Any problems? No, no problems. Are you coming with Mi-young? She sings at the club on Fridays. I wanted to come early for you. But the party dragged on. Su-hyeon, let's drink. Just you and me. Get some liquor... Heavy, isn't he? He becomes talkative when he's drunk. He's just a sociable person. Want some coffee? Sure. I'll get it. -No. -Sit. I'll get it for you. Where'd it go? You can't see it? What's wrong with me? Why is my heart racing? If I turn around, will you look away again? What? Why do you always do that? Is it that important to you what others think? Of course. I'm married and have more to protect. Does that make you happy? What do you mean? I'm simply asking what makes you really happy. When you're married... you get to put other things before your own happiness. Ye-sul is quite pretty, like her mom. The time will come for her to meet a nice guy and get married. And like her mom... she will start forgetting how lovely she is... unable to look into the eyes of a guy that she likes. Is that what you want? It's none ofyour business. Stop it. You have a beautiful neck. And prettier eyes. Don't hide your beauty. Let it show. -Hello? -It's me, Jin-young. Hey, Mi-young. You just got home? Right. Did Su-hyeon leave? No, he's here. Hold on. -Mi-young. -Hi, Su-hyeon. -What were you doing? -I was about to leave. I'm almost done here. Can you pick me up? Sure, I'm on my way. Okay. Su-hyeon. Will you marry me? Shouldn't I be the one proposing? Mi-young, will you marry me? Hello? Ye-sul, play for 2 hours at the daycare, okay? Sun-young. Not coming? What do you think makes life fun? It's just fun, and it's raining! It's the unexpected that makes it so exciting. You're wearing that to go hiking? I'm not going. Let's go get some fresh air. I said I'm not going! Why are you yelling at her? Mom. Should I call offthe marriage? What are you talking about? You guys got into a fight? I don't know! Mom. Do you think I love Su-hyeon? I know you do. A lot. Sorry. I'm just... Nothing. I'll stay home. What's wrong with her? She's been sensitive lately. Right. Thanks, Professor. Okay. How's your thesis going? It's been published. Professor Uhm is so supportive... that others are going easy on me. Oh my... So pretty! -You're so beautiful. -lsn't she? -How about? -You're gorgeous. Jin-young, it's so weird. What? I feel so nervous and edgy. Someone's here to see the bride. I'll go. Oh God, Sang-il! Hi. I have something for Mi-young. You do? Thanks. I'll make sure she gets it. Can l... Can I give it to her in person? That's... She's kind of busy right now. I'm sure. But it won't take long. That's not a good idea. I'll give it to her, okay? -But -Bye. It's the necklace that you've always wanted. You had to do this, didn't you? I can't believe you got me a wedding present. Why don't you wish me a good marriage too? Be happy. I know you will. Mi-young... I ran into him at the pool. And we drank a little together. Forget it. It's not like you slept with him. That's no big deal. I did. Your hair! And... I loved it. Mi-young, calm down. Listen carefully. Do you love Su-hyeon, or not? I do. What about Sang-il? I think I love him too. The thing is... I don't love him the same as I love Su-hyeon. But it's definitely love. What should I do? Which one do you want to marry? You can love both, but you can't marry both. I have no idea. Ifyou don't, who does? I don't know! But I know I will regret it if I marry Su-hyeon today. I should tell him. Are you crazy?! It's not something you can discuss over the phone. Right, calm down first. I really don't know. Your hair! Women & Sex Can we talk? Come on in. Is it a disease, loving more than one person at a time? Because you've given it to Mi-young. You slept with Sun-young, too, didn't you? Want some tea? You love both Mi-young and Sun-young? What about coffee? Tell me what you have to say! Do you want to kiss me? -Open up! Oh God! What have I done?! You're not even dressed? Hey. I was going to take a shower. Hurry up! You don't wanna be late for your wedding -Thanks for coming. -Hi. Is Han Sun-young here? She's my sister. I see. Hi, I'm Professor Uhm, Sun-young's academic adviser. Oh, I've heard a lot about you. I'll take you to her. Okay. Your professor is here. How are you? Good. How about you? I'm good, too. Jin-young, hold on. -What? -Something's on your back. Odd, what was that doing there? Mi-young! I can't believe this! -Mom! -Let me talk to her. Mi-young! Jin-young, I can't marry him. You can't do this now. I can't make up my mind. It's your wedding day! Let me talk to her. Mi-young, look at me. -Su-hyeon. -Yes? I have something to tell you. Frankly... I have a secret. -I really... -Wait. You don't have to tell me. Who doesn't have secrets? You think I don't? But... There's no rush here. Follow your heart. Wherever that secret of yours may lead you... The marriage comes after that. Thanks, Su-hyeon. Everybody has secrets. They don't make you happy, butyou can have them to be happy I gave each of them a secret to keep, and they became that much happier It's over. We're breaking up. Honey, but why? Don't whine!
