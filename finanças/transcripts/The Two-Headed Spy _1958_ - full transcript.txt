Only the bad polish roads and the supply problem can slow our offensive. If our panzer columns with no opposition in front of them Are halted in the middle of Poland because of supply failure... ... our prestige... - Are you telling me that we cannot supply 75 divsions for this campaign! - No,Mein Fuhrer! I simply asking the question. - I want answers ,not questions! - Myrtle! - Yeah! - I have asked Colonel Schottland of my staff... ...to prepare a report on the logistical situation. - Mein,Fuhrer! - Gentelmen! I have before me made pages of facts and figures... ...detailed data of the problems of supply for our forces in the Polish campaign. But, we are on the eve of war. At this late hour Fuhrer want solutions not problems. I'm sure, that I'm speaking for my superiors, when I say That if the Fuhrer orders... ...that we supply 75 divisions or 100 divisions It will be done! I have taken the liberty of preparing a tender to the report... .....showing how this supply mission can be accomplished. However,if the General Staff wishes to hear a detailed logistical report -No!- No! That won't be necessary now! Now there will be continued negotiations with England and France during the coming week, But this will no affect my plans. On the 1st september - We Will Attack! Come on,Come on! Let's have a tost to our newest general. - Speech!- Speech! All I can say is, I owe my good fortune today to you my friends and to the faith we all have in the Fuhrer. - To Fuhrer! Gentelmen! The Ladies,as promised. Would the general care to meet any of these ladies in particular? - Is that a part of you official duties too. - Not exactly official,sir. - But I've been aid general before. - Schottland! General Hauser,I hear you recommended my promotion. Please,accept my thanks. - You supply operation in the Polish campaign was a remarkable achivement. - You deserved recognition. You are very kind. - And your supply operation for this party is... Now I want to make a recommendation to you. Stay where you are. - Excuse me,Gentelmen. Whould you come this way. - Oh,no.Thats not fair. Come and meet our guest of honour. - Our Lili! Our finest import from our Italian allies. we've met before, several times. Yes, the soldier who runs away. I hope he's bravier on the battlefield than his with women I think, I frighten the General. General Schottland as fearless as a lion! I guaranteed. Whould you sing for us? Please! What would you like to hear? I sing it especially for you. - You decide. Schottland, someone wants to meet you. The english woman who brodcast for us.- Oh.Yeah General Schottland - Miss Karen Crusher. - Well,don't stand there. Are you said you wanted to talk to her,didn't you. I'm flattered that you wanted to talk to me,General. - Yes, on behalf of Lieutenant Reinisch. He's you most ardent admirer. His greatest wish was to meet You He felt, the job duty merited a higher rank than his, But, I assured him, that you judge a man by his service to the Fuhrer... ...rather than by his rank. - Yes ,of course. - Will you excuse me. Does he dislike all women, for a moment I thought it was only me. - Oh,no. It's not a matter of dislike, ..his interest maybe, He devoted to his career. He must have some other interest.- Oh, yes! Clocks! - Colonel? This is a surprise. Is anything wrong,that you come here this time of night? - No.Nothing. - Have important news? - No, no news. - You Rascal! No news! So now is General Schottland! That's wonderful! But just for that you come here this time at night. - We got a drink.- Of course. scotch whiskey oh The last of the scotch whiskey. - Oh. - Well, what goes with promotion. A new assignment? - No, no change of assignment. But something new goes with rank An aeroplane. I have been assigned the plane fueled and ready to take off. I can go anywhere. I could be in England in a few hours - Bad thoughts. - Bad thoughts. 25 years. 25 years ever since I living this masquerade Living as an exile,with roots going nowhere. Clock without face. I felt at home for the first time... when I sat in the cockpit of that plane. For the first time I could forget I was written off as atraitor by my country,my family. They've never relieve you of your post You know that. Even if you did escape the War Office ... will probably consider you a deserter. You still under order. - You Know that too. - Yes I know it. It's not been easy for you,Alex. And it will be more difficult for you, as time goes on. But, it is be difficult for others too Yes,of course.You right I know,I shouldn't complain. If I'd spent those years at home, with any luck, I might, perhaps, be a major. Possibly not even that. Now.What's realy wrong,Alex? You know,everybody I've seen gets into this mood in the first year at their assigment You clocks are well done and 24 years behind... - No!No! I'm not sorry for myself. - It's just, that I had a big fright this evening.That's all. - Somebody suspect some?- No. - What than? A Woman. A very beatiful woman. I met her again tonight. - No,you needn't worry.I shan't fall in love or anything like that. - I know the risk. - It doesn't worry me. It worried you and that worried me. You've done so well with a difficult assigment, I hate to offer advice. - Your advice has saved my life more than once. - Alex,You're on duty 24 hours a day. You've got to learn to relax. With this promotion you're under magnifying glass You'll be conspicuous, if you don't run with the pack. That shouldn't be so hard for you to do... ...from what I hear of the women in your circle. Go back to the job. Running away from this woman will only be worse. - No,I've been lock in the barn for too long. This might lead to more,than just pleasant evening. I can't take the chance. - But You don't have to I should take the chance. - Is that an order? - Of course. Brandy,please. Tell me one thing - is it me you don't like or my singing? You always seem to dissapear. - Well,tonight I've come back. That must prove, that I like both. - You can be nice,when you want to. I forgive you. - Let's drink to that. To the nice things in life! - Tell do you like clocks? - Clocks? - Yeah.I collect them. I've got queit a large collection in my apartment. I'll like to show them to you. - Don't you mean etchings? - No! Clocks! - I'll be delighted - How beatifull! - I only acquired in the other day It's a musical pair of technic clock it has quiet a history The most interesting thing is that it was made originally.... - What kind a clock is that? - That? Oh that's quite interesting... - It's called Clepsydrae. It's probably the earliest type of timepiece... ...that can be called a mechanical clock. This cylinder is filled with water... ...which drips through this opening regularly into the tank below.. ...causing a float inside to fall and so work the gears. You see,like this. - Interesting. These clocks are very nice. Is that all you're interested in? Is that all you want out of life? - Well,it's very difficult to know what one does want of life. Do you know what you want? - Yes, for me it's easy. I'm a woman. I want to be a succesful singer. - Do you know, you're at the end of the road? You've nowhere to go. You are a woman and You are a successful singer. Your records are heard everywhere. You sing on the radio and broadcast to the Troops. - But my real ambition is to sing in Paris and London. Hurried up for me,will You? Start attack on France soon so I can see Paris while I'm still young. - Did I say something wrong? - On the contrary,You remind me of all the work I have to do,if we are to ccelerate victory in West. For You. My aide will drive home. Reinisch! - Good night. - Good night. - It's alright.We alone. - Operation 'Sea Lion' has been abondoned. - Abondoned? - By the order of the Fuhrer himself. - So.Adolf is not readyto attempt the invasion of England. - It's definitely off. Supply are already being shifted eastward. - Russia. - Send it to ours "The General Staff thinks it's madness" -The are right. This is wonderful news,Alex. This is the begining of the end. It should bind Russia to the west for all tight. - I don't trust the Bear as you do I've seen the Brute firsthand - Let' s get this news out at once. - More news for you. I been appointed deputy chief of supply. - Wonderful,Alex! - I shall have an important voice in all supply operation. I can bring the whole military machine into chaos. Supplies will get lost or they won't get there in time... - Don't be childish! You will do the best job of military planning that you humanly can. After 25 years of this work you ought to be able to remember.... ...that you're not a saboteur. - But situation has change! - The situation has not change. Not for you. The secrets that you get,such as,today ... ...may be of more value to the Allied High Command... ...than any service you can perform for the German - But it could be so easy for me. - Out of the question If you are dismissed from your post for some blunder You could be of no service to your country at all. From now on the Gestapo will be watching you more carefully This aide of yours- fellow Reinisch. He's undoubtedly a Gestapo man himself - No doubt of that. - So far as you are aware, has he any possible basis for being suspiciou sof it? - No! Why should he suspect me. I'm a perfect Nazi. Their report was of such a nature, Admiral Canariss I thought they should transmitted directly to you. - Sit down,Muller. Well,I'm listening. - To begin with,sir. Ever since i've been with general Shottland I've done some investigation on my own. and I've discovered, that Schottland is not his right name. He was born Alexander Scott His parents were English and he was educated at Oxford University - Your information is incomplete. He was born of an english father and a german mother. He spent his childhood in South Africa. He attended Heidelberg as well as Oxford In 1914 he germanize his name Enlisted in German Army and distinguished himself as a... ...galant and loyal German officer throughout the war - But,sir.A man with such background. - Dual nationalities are common,even among our national leaders. Rudolf Hess was born and raised in Egypt and the Fuhrer himself is an austrian. - Yes ,sir. A man cannot control the circumstances of his birth, but he can make a choice. General Schottland made the right choice. If Schottland whould be a spy He would return to England after Armistice in 1918. Insted He remain to German And Germany was a defeated nation and it was hard to be a patriotic german Your assignment to general Schottland is routine. All highranking officers are under surveillance of this sort I don't want to discourage or vigilance But it would be well for you to exercise discretion. - Yes,sir. - I 'am Late for Staff meeting General Schottland is one of rising star of Third Reich. And has already won the Fuhrer's favorable attention. - I remember that,sir. - Good day,gentelmen. - Satisfied. The Fuhrer himself raised Schottland to General Staff Corp. Apparently, he is satisfied. - General Schottland is very clever man. - And unlike some of his colleagues on the General Staff a model National Socialist. A one hundred percenter. - That's what bother me. He's too perfect. He's one hundred and one percenter. - What do you think of it? - I don't know,sir. - I'm afraid it didn't quite what I'm looking for. - Sorry to be late,gentelmen. Please don't let me disturb you. Continue. - As you know the enemy's main effort appears to be in the direction of Saint-Lo. The Seventh Army has been unable to mount a counterattack. and forced northeast of Saint-Lo because of the critical supply situation Enemy air attack has demolished 90 percent of our tactical quartermaster stores ... ...in areas Q,V and Y. The petrol reserves of Panzer Group West have been completely destroyed. Even the secret deposit at Marigny and Agneaux be wiped out by pinpoint bombing - How could this happen? That is the question before us. General Merkel fuse we cannot lay the blame to faulty camouflage. - Right, Merkel. - Yes. I personally inspected all supply areas in a lowflying plane. If I hadn't known where the dumps were I couldn't have spotted them myself. - General Hauser's theory is that a wellorganized french undeground is the cause of our trouble. - Intelligence has established,that the undeground particularly active in those areas - Mere civilian agents equipped with radio transmitters which is probable, they report the position of our location as soon as we set them up. - Yes,I agree. There's no other possible explanation. - We all agree.- Yes,sir. - I do not. Any french civilians found in areas Q and V would be shot on sight. They were all evacuated three month ago. Furthermore decoy depots have been set up in that area How is it then,that enemy aircraft bombed only the actual depots and left the decoys untouched. As General Merkel says Our depots were so carefully camouflaged that are own air spotters had difficulty in finding them. How is it then that enemy were able to score direct hits on every single one of them. - Then what possibility do you suggest,general? - I suggest the enemy knew the exact location of those depots. I suggest the posssibility of the leak of information at a very high level. - Just what do you mean 'on very high level'? - I mean from General Staff itself. - This is preposterous. - By all mean,general . Traitors often spring up in the most preposterous places. - This is outrageous! - What is your evidence? - General Schottland,You are my deputy. I refuse to permit you to make such reckless charges in my presence without the evidence to back them up. - Evidence of treason,General Wagner,does not come neatly wrapped in packages. - I'm suggesting a possibility. - Do not be evasive! Whom are you accusing? - Nobody in particular is yet. But we all know General Staff officers, who disagree with the Fuhrer's strategy. Who maintained that we cannot win the war Defeatists,who haven't the courage to bring their views into the open. You've heard their whispers.We all heard. I submit,gentelmen,the defeatism is a doorway to treason. But two defeatist together,then you have a conspiracy - You call it evidence. - In 15 years,in my 15 years on General Staff Corp.. ...I never heard of such a irresponsible and malicious gossip... ...from a fellow officer! With your permission. - General Schottland. I suggest that you leave espionage.. ...to Group Leader Kaltenbrunner and his Secret Service and address yourself to your own duties in the supply service. - Marshall Keitel,with your permission. - That is all,Gentelmen. What's now,General. - I know You want concrete evidence.I don't have it. I suppose it was idiotic. - Not idiotic. Rush,perhaps.But not idiotic. When you spoke of defeatist takling You referring to Noem? - I know. - Anyone else? -Colonel Heitz - Yes,I know about him. There others as well and it goes beyond talk. As you suggest is probably a conspircy. I have reason to believe there may be a plot against Fuhrer himself I don't yet have all the links in the chain, but when I do. You probably won't be hearing any more Defeatist talk. You disloyal colleagues won't trust you now. Alex, it's Cornatz.I must see you. -Follow me up ,I leave my door open,if it's safe. -Dietz? -Dietz? Reinisch? - I have to take a risk.They've arrested my courier. - May I sit down? Yes,of course. - So,do not go to the shop until you hear from me. From now on I shall transmit your information myself. - Is that wise? - I think it's not wise but we have to take some risk. When can you get me the information about the new supply dumps in northern France? - I shall have the overlays of exact location of the depoes within a week. - And,....Alex, It is very important that we should not have any change In his strength or location of German divisions on the French coast on the French coast since your last report There no be changes, whatsoever. - Are you certain? - Yes,changes were contemplated and then dropped. - No,we have to plan on the possibility of my being eliminated of my being eliminated from the scene. If anything should happen to me,you will find your new contact in the personal column of the "Volkischer Beobachter". There will be an item advertising the sale of 'Nuremberg Egg" it is one of the oldest timepieces small enough to be considered a watch. - I am familiar with the "Nuremberg Egg" - Of course,I forgotten what an expert you become. You will go to the adress listed and you will offer 3000 marks - But is not worth nearly as much as that. - Exactly! If the seller refuses your generous offer and insists of a price of 900 marks you wiil have found my replacement. - It is you who must be careful,Alex. You are irreplaceable one. On the War Office may be able to replace you,I cannot. - Some sentimentality for the modern Hitler Gener... I must be going - Would you like a drink?- No,thank you. The nice collection of clocks you have here Some I haven't seen before. - Good bye,old friend. The latest operation report just arrived Shall I enter it on the map,sir? - No,I'll do it.It's very late. You get on home. - Have my car,Sandra. - Yes,sir. - My car here? - Yes,sir. - All right. I shall need you anymore tonight. Dietz will drive me home. - I'm afraid that would be impossible,sir. - What did you say? - I've orders acompany yourself to Gestapo Hedquaters. - Naturally,sir,I don't know details I heard some talk. - What sort of talk? - That the old antique delear Cornatz has been arrested. -Oh? - I can only assume,sir, that since you patronized his shop the Gestapo wants you for some routine questioning. - It is considered of you not to assume that I myself there under suspicion. - Call the Gestapo Headquarters. Tell them I'm coming right over. - Tell me now. You tell me sooner or later so why not spare yourself the agony. - You friend General Schottland is here. - For his sake, let's get it over this quickly. - Tell us your contacts.I can help you. - Swine! - No! - His dead. - You should've anticipated that. - Do you suspect everyone who patronized that antique shop? Cornatz had a half a dozen officers of general rank among his clients, General Wagner,Marshal Goering. Does that make Goering spy? - Cornatz was found with top secret documents in his possession, which could only have come from the service of supply. - This materials could be available to at least ten other generals besides myself. - What was the connection beween Cornatz and the assassins - The assassins? - Whould you answer my quiestion? Will you plotters working for Allied inteligence. - The plot against the Fuhrer? - So You know? Go on. - I know nothing about it Except that I had my suspisions. - Indeed. Will it make it easier for you to confess if I tell you that your plot has failed. I had a call from the Fuhrer's field headquarters less than an hour ago. Your bomb exploded according to schedule, Several officers were killed, But the Fuhrer himself escaped without serious injury. - The Fuhrer safe.I'm glad. - You interest in the Fuhrer's welfare is almost convincing. - You accused me! Your hands are not as clean as mine in this affair. Get me Kaltenbrunner on the phone! I'll talk to him about this and to no one else! - Get me Group Leader Kaltenbrunner,please, on the other telephone. - Kaltenbrunner. - Group Leader Kaltenbrunner.This is Group Leader Muller speaking. I have with me.... Yes,sir,I am listening. - I have arrested three of the plotters here von Stauffenberg,Olbricht,von Quirnheim Have you got that? Good. You will arrest general Hauser and Merkel immediately. Let Heitz alone for moment have him followed and see where he leads us. Quatermaster General Wagner was involed, but he saved us a trouble by taking his own life. Thre are others in the service of supply, who are implicated. - Yes,sir.I have just arrested one of them myself. General Schottland. He still denying everything, But I think we can get him to talk before long. Good bye,sir. - Issue orders for the arrests of generals Hauser and Merkel at once. - General Schottland you are under arrest. For treason And if you think that your rank will spare you from... ..our more persuasive methods of interrogation You're quite mistaken! - I don't believe that was Kaltenbrunner on the phone at all. - That's enought -Thank you. This is Group Leader Muller speaking. - You idiot! Did you said that you arrested general Schottland. - Yes,sir. Schottland is one of the few men on the staff, who is absolutely in the clear. He senced the existence of a plot almost as soon as I did and what is more important told me about it. Release him at once, apologize and make it convincing. General Schottland. You are free to go. That has been some mistake. I hope you will accept my apologies for the rude treatment to which you've been subjected. You understand,that such methods are often necessary, if we're to track down the real traitors. - Don't apologize,Muller. You're only doing your duty. Thank you,sir. - Everyone must serve the Fatherland in his own way... ..even occasional halfwit. - Thank you,Dietz - Exellence - You advertise the Nuremberg egg for sale. Nuremberg Egg,Nuremberg Egg,Nure... Right! Yes,sir. Of course,it is not in working order, but,as an antique,very nice. - I'm willing to pay up to 3000 thousand marks for the right one. - 3000 marks! It's yours. For 3000 marks I'm even willing put it in working order fot you. - Nevermind ,It's not the one I'm looking for - But Exellence.... - General? This is indeed a surprise. - There must be some mistake, Advertisment said 97 Marburg Strasse. - This is 97 Marburg Strasse. Won't you come in - General. - I'm sorry. I don't wish to inconvenience you. The newspaper must be an error. I was interested in an antique that was advertised. - The Nuremberg Egg? - That's correct. - The advertisement made no mention of price. - The General should know more about it than I. How much would you offer? -Well,I'm looking for something special. For the right one I'm willing to pay up to 3000 marks. - That seems to be a great deal of money, for a watch that doesn't even keep time. - Well, what do you think it's worth? - Uh...Oh,well. It shows you ,really,how little I know. I was willing to sell it for 900 marks. - Oh,that price is a bargain. But I'm afraid it isn't exactly,what I'm looking for If you will excuse the intrusion. Captain. - I would like to sell it. I'm sorry it isn't exactly,what you want. - So am I. Good day! - Come. - You ordered me to report on my return,sir. -Yes. - File a report immediately for tommorow Staff Meeting. - Yes, sir. - Quite a coincidence meeting you. - Yes. Thats all. - Yes,sir. - May I have your coat. - You did say 900 marks? - Yes. And you did say 3000 marks. - Yes. - Unbelievable. - Do you have anything to drink? - Yes,I think we both can use one. - Brandy? - Thank you. - Soda? - Please. - Remember that evening,when you took me to your house after the dance. - You seemed kind of... - Attracted to you.I was. - You behaved so strangely,I couldn't understand it. And I was annoyed at my failure to develop a possible source of information. -It's amusing now,but at the time it wasn't Hiding the smallest personal feelings for fear of betrayal. I feel released from an emotional straitjacket. You don't know what this means to me. With you I can.... - No,You cannot. With me you must be as in person as though you were the General Staff. Our dealing must be professional. Objective. Anything else would endanger our work and ourselves. - You quite right. Is it You, who receives my orders from London. -Yes. - How? It's a shortwave receiver. - You can be shout for having that. - I can be shout for almost anything I do. if I'm caught. - How do you transmit my information? - I have a method. I'll explane what it is, as you friend Cornatz whoud have said "When you need to know it" - Very well. - May I..? - Of course. Will you find a cover... Some excuse for meeting each other regularly. - Let the Gestapo think we having a love are affair. The facts must be otherwise. - Oh,yes,of course. Well,Captain Reinisch complicate matters? - No, I don't think he'll be a problem at all. - Good. We must arrange a plan ,so that we dont carry incriminating documents around with us. - I'll come to youp place,any time you want me to and spend a night. - Good evening. - Good evening - The general is expecting me. I know.May I. These days bargains are hard to find. - He made me a very good offer. I couldn't turn it down. - It seems you both found what you were looking for. - Is that surprise you? - Not really. I should have expected it. I was born to be general's aid The dinner is waiting. - Well....LiLy! - Anything else I can do,sir? - No,nothing else tonight. - Very good,sir. - You told me it was important. - You have underestimated captain Reinicsh He is a bigger problem than you thought. - No,he's just jealous and proud. He thiks he's in love with me. - He also a Gestapo agent. - What would you do about. He must be disposed off. Effectively and positively. There's only one way. Come into my bedroom......please. - What is it? -Yeah....open it and you'll find out. - Oh, it's lovely. - When I saw it I thought it was made for you. - Oh,I don't know what to say! - And don't say anything. - Do You call that a kiss. That's better, Much better. "..I don't know what to say?-Then don't say anything..." "... do you call that a kiss...That's better.Much better" "..After tonight nothing...... - Fascinating! Tell me ,is this a work of an agent of the Secret Service or of the Peeping Tom. - I'm sorry,sir. I should have played it before taking your time. - Thing isn't even passionate much less incriminating. "... your affair with Captain Reinisch....Captain Reinisch He's nothing to me,He just an amusing young boy.That's all...." - Reinisch! "...kiss me..." If another one of your hunches backfires it'll be your head, not his. "....wait,close the door,please..." - Turn it off! Coun-ter offen-sive Arden,...sector "Counter offensive,Arden sector,december 15" is too long. I'll have to cut the words "counter" and "Sector". I'm sorry! But we must get that information back. This is going to be a major push. If von Rundsted breaks through it could be a major disaster. - Do you know anything about harmonics? - No - Then you wouldn't understand I can't get all this into one song. This method of transmitting information is to limited. - You must get that message through. - I think I've got it now. I'm getting through on my broadcast tommorrow night - I won't be seeing you for a couple of weeks. - Why? - I leave for the front a day after tommorrow for conferences with von Runsted about the supplies for his offensive. - Take care of yourself. - I should be listening to your broadcast tommorrow night. "Today the 21st of october 1944... ... the futile uprising in Warsaw was brought to an end. Our positions there remain secure for all time. And that is the end of the news for tonight. - Heil Hitler! This hour of song is dedicated to our armed forces wherever they may be. Our regular soloist on this broadcast fraulen Lily Barone will not be with us this evening But in her place Radio Berlin takes pleasure in presenting Emmy Koerner whose inimitable style has already made her a favorite songstress of the German soldiers. - Wait for me here. - Yes,sir. - You shouldn't have come here. - What happend? - I don't know. I was taken off the air at the last moment. - Any reason given? - No. - The Gestapo? - No sign of them. - I don't understand.I must be suspect. There's no other good reason My singing has never been so popular with the troops as it now. Alex, you must leave at once. Until I find out what's behind of this. - Alex! - I can protect you. - Alex,don't you see what's happening. We've been caught by emotions and personal feeling. - Our emotions sinful,our personal feelings a crime? - Yes,for us they are. - I just shrug,when the Gestapo arrest you and when they quiestion you - If it happens - Yes! - Well, I won't - If they found out about me there's nothing you can do. If they haven't there's nothing we have to do. - Your radio,we must dispose of that. - If they come for evidence, the radio will matter the least. Don't think of me. Think of a way of getting that message through. - I have to go to the front tomorrow. I have a chance then. - How? - I pick up a field transmitter. I should be near the front lines. - I'll slip away by myself and transmit the message. - But there''ll be a German Army to surround the area. They track you down. - Not,if I work fast enough. - There must be some other way. - Can you think of one? - No,but Alex.... - We will say goodbye without emotion,without personal feelings and if we're lucky,we'll see each other again. and there'll be another party, unemotinal and impersonal - Attention,Allied Forces, Alllied Forces,Attention Attention,Allied forces,attention, Relay the following information to your headquarters. This is code.... Sir,would you explain to me what you're doing - Corporal,is it your habit to question general officer - No,sir! But the circumstances are unusual. If the General,please,identify himself. - Of course, I'm General Reidmeister. - I mean identification papers,sir. May I see your papers,sir? - Yes, there're in my briefcase.I'll get them... - Stay where you are! I get them. It's corpral Zuitalein. He stll alive. - Can you remember exactly, Exactly!, what he said when they brought him in. - Something was a radio transmitter and a German General shooting him. It was incoherent. - Can you give him injection or something to bring him to. - He's in a coma,major, You'll have to wait. - How long? - The bullet lodged in his spine. Could be a day,a week, a month, If he lives. - You didn't answer the door, I thought the Gestapo... - Alex! - I'm worried about you,Alex. I've missed you so. - I'm failed A patrol...suprise me in the woods, when I was sending out the message. - Did they see,what you were doing? -Well,it doesn't matter, I kll them. - All of them? - Yes! - Are you sure? - Yes. - Are they given any reason yet for taking you off the air? - The official reason is that my singing was too sad. It's sentimental for the troops - As long as dr.Goebbels considers himself an authority on the entertainment world, maybe that is the reason. - No. If that were true they also banned my records. I'm afraid they figure out my code and now are waiting. Waiting for me to lead them to other agents That's why after tonight.... - I know what you're gonna say,Lily, But it doesn't make sense. We've established ourselves in everybody's eyes as lovers To suddenly stop seeing each other now would be too suspicious. - You must hide! - Hide! - Open it! - I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour, But the matter is urgent. - This is General Schottland. - May I see you papers,General? - Captain! Is general Schottland. - I've seen you many times in Wermaht quaters,sir. - Thank you. - May we speak with you alone? - Yes,of course. - You will excuse us,General? - You understand we shall check on you statements If they are inaccurate... - You will find,that I've told you the truth. - Were you leaving too,General? - Please stay awhile,Alex. The gentelmen are through with their business. - What did they want? - Ambitious little Nazi stepped on the toes of a big Nazi. And now he's wanted for defeatism. - Who is he?. - The Berlin radio censor. They can't find him. They're checking everyone,who knew him. I haven't seen him in months. - Is that all they asked you about? - That's all. Maybe they're not on my trail at all. - I don't think they are. - Then all we need to worry about is how to trasmit your information - I don't know the way of getting it through There's only one thing to do. - What's that? - Cornatz used to argue against it But now there's no other choise. I must work out a method of sabotaging the Ardenne offensive. - We will destroy their armies and we will drive them into the sea! - I wish to congratulate the Furher. This operation will be an answer and a sharp lesson to those of little faith. I have just returned from Marshall von Rundstedt headquarters. The Marshall has posed certain suplly problems He requests that the forces committed under him be provided with ten days supplies Are we must consider whether such a diversion of material, would not jepordize us in the event of a winter offensive by the enemy on the Eastern Front. - What does Quatermaster General Topper have to say about that. It is true that, what was assigned to von Rundstedt cannot be sent to Eastern Front, but fuel is crucial both in the West and in the East - Doesn't anyone have a definite idea? - My Fuhrer! The Ardenne offensive is based on quick penetration. If the Marshall is stalled for lack of supplies, it will failed - Marshall von Rundstedt asked for ten days suplies his estimate cannot be questioned. - Any commanders estimate can be questioned! They always ask for more than they need! We''ll be able to use captured enemy stores, as we advance. - Brilliant! The Fuhrer has provided the solution. With the enemy supply dumps falling into our hands this campaign can be operated with three days supplies instead of ten. The Americans have vast fuel depots in the Bastogne area. That we know. Given a quick penetration we can capture those depoes intact. - General Schottland this is... -Hshhhhh! - I know there will be objections from textbook strategists and from those who cannot find a word "audacity" in their dusty manual. I do believe they will be wrong! - Does anyone here have an objection? It is not confirmed, that the forces under General Montgomery have broken von Rundstedt's tribe to the sea. They have taken the initiative and will soon be entering the heart of Germany. Von Runstedt's inability to hold his newly won positions in the Ardenne come as something of a surprise. In the South General Patton's Third Army is attacking von Rundstedt flank and as quickly moving towards the Siegfried Line and Hitler's stronghold in Berchtesgaden. - Von Runstedt has run out of fuel. The Battle of the Bulge is over. - I got a letter from my son at the front His group thanks you for the picture you sent them. - Thank you. - We were used to listen to you on the radio. We enjoy your singing very much. - So your public have not forgotten you. - No,not completely. I still get mail ,telling me, how much they've enjoyed my singing and how much they miss me. A few days ago I received most ardent letter from no less than a general. He particulary enjoyed the extra little something I added to my song. - That maybe our answer. Soldiers want to hear you sing. You have an obligation, as a patriotic German citizen. Isn't you responde to their demands? - Yes,of course. What you mean? - Smile,we may be watched. Unless the Allies get definite information that, Hitler will fight it out in Berlin, Th is gone - I still don't understand? -You know. You should volunteer to entertain on the Western Front. To sing to front line troops I go with you. Information would be deliver to the Allies personally. With my rank to get us well forward. There should be no difficulty in getting across the Allied line. - But getting back it would be more difficult, if we want it. - Why come back The war is almost over. - Where shall we be when the war ends Alex,London or... - We? I'm being with you to help cross allied line I'm still under orders. When Hitler's faithfuls begin to crack under the pressure I should be there to help the process alone ... and enjoy it - If I had any choice I should like to remain with you. There is no choice. You assigned to me not for my consolation, but to transmit information. Thank you! - Wake me in 06:00.- Yes ,sir. - Good night,Reinicsh.- Good night, sir. - Here is a map of the area This road leads directly to the american lines Stay on it for half a mile and take to the fields This way you may avoid patrols - Sound simple. - No,Should you be stopped, say that you're looking fo this village,Einsberg, Where you believe your husband might be. They'll direct you back to this Inn, As soon you out of sight, cross this field and take this alternate road - I don't think I'd have any problem. Now,when you make contact with the Americans You have to tell your story many times before they'll believe and untill they check the codeword - Is there anything else? - No,nothing else. - Good luck. - I wish you would be going with me - I'll be with you soon. - You know, Just outside central London there is very old Inn called the Fiddlers Three, I don't know why it comes to mind, but in a sence it, it's everything I missed all these years. One day I take you there and around us men and women will be drinking,laughing,... ...arguing Remember,that will be our first rendezvous and the war is over. - What would we be like then? - You and I? - I'm anxious to find out. - Hault! - Please, help me. I'm trying to find a village of Einsberg,where.... Kurt! - I was just about to call you,sir.It's one minute past six. I'm sorry I'm late. - It looks like you haven't been to bed all night. - I haven't,sir. - I met a young lady here. The General has no objections? - Objections?I have nothing, but admiration! I wish we could draw such reserves of energy from every german officer My breakfast. -Yes,sir. - Hello. - Group Leader Muller at Gestapo headquarters in Berlin. Hurry,please. - All lines to Berlin are tied up. - It's an important military call It must go through. - I'm sorry,sir,there's nothing I can do till are lines are cleared. - Will you hang up,please. - Good morning!- Two breakfasts. -Yes,sir,Yes. - Well,corpral Zuitailein, you know or don't you? - I don't know. All i know that his name sounded like Reidenhorst - Oh,the name isn't important it's probably false anyway, but surely you remember, what he looked like. - I've looked through all these. - Has he seen a photograph of every German general? - No,sir. Only those under the command of marshall von Rundstedt. I didn't consider it necessary to include the generals on the Eastern Front - Officer of another command might have been visiting the area General staff officer for example... Get me a photograph of general Schottland and get me captain Reinisch on the telephone Seem to remember something about Schottland visiting von Rundstedt Reinisch will know the exact date. - I want to speak with captain,Reinisch,please. -Yes...Yes! I understand. - Take a look at this. This is you man,isn't it? Isn't it? - I don't know. It looks like him. But it's hard to be sure. - Could you identify him, if you saw him in person? - I think so. Especially if I heard his voice. I think I would recognize his voice. - Good. - Captain Reinisch is still on the Western Front with General Schottland - Corporal,you've going to have a little vacation in Berlin. Take him out. The moment general Schottland and his aide return they to be brought here,for what,I hope, will be a little reunion with corpora Zutailein.l - There're defeatist hanging on the lamp post. Which is worst the defeatist or traitors? - I only take a few minutes to get the papers I need. Reinisch call a headquarters and tell them we'll be late Reinisch! Don't you hear me? - Yes,I heard you. - Why didn't you answer? - Ever since last night I've been thinking about you and me I even call the Gestapo today, but it didn't get through Perhaps,it was faith,because it gave me more time to think. To try to find an answer. - To what? - You will die here. You death will appear suicide The way a general for Third Reich would choose to die. With honor to the uniform you wear. Not as a traitor, whose hands are covered with blood of men who trusted you. You will buried with full military honors Your coffin draped with the flag And no one will ever know the truth - What do you hope to preserve by all this? - Before you die, I must know the truth. Tell me,who are you? - You don't want to know who I am, You want to know who you are and what you are. You Third Reich was built on meticulous response to authority and it's being destroyed by You want to know why? For healthy sign! But it's too late Reinisch for you, too late for the truth. What made you start thinking? What made you have doubts? Did you suddenly have a human moment and did it surprise you After living all these years without conscience,Reinisch - You talk about conscience! What I have done I've done for my country Right or wrong this honor - Truth is honor,Reinisch, and justice - Truth is allegiance. Even as I suspected you deep inside me I hoped it would be a lie. - I'm sorry for you,Reinisch,and the others. - I don't want your pity! Hate me as I hate You. Hate is all I have left. - Sir, No reply from Schottland quaters. - Still no word from Reinisch? -No. I'm still trying to reach him. - Well,where was that girl's body found? - Outside the village of Einesberg. In a ditch. On a road leading to the american lines. . Search general Schottland's apartment Even if you find nothing, wait there until he returns. Then bring him here for corporal Zuitailen to identify. Take me to the Fuhrer bunker. - General Schottland,I wish to see the Fuhrer. - Yes,General. - One moment,please. - Schottland. - General Hart. - You know the others: Kurher,Rupert,Eikler,Zaiss,Orbietz. - You just come from the front,haven't you? What do you think? - There is always hope! - You sound like him in there. - The enemy is crushing our defenses on all sides. The Soviets on the gates of Berlin. And you think there's hope. General Weingster Third Army is still intact. Untill that is gone ,there still a hope. -We've....We've been discussing other measures Schottland Are you familiar with Wermacht high command's directive on preserving officer corp? We have to consider of the time has come to applied. If Germany is to be reconstructed the officer corp must remain intact. It must be brought to the attention of the Fuhrer and it must be presented by someone who enjoys his respect and confidence. - You think I'm such a person. Is that what you saying? - Yes. - Will you do it,Schottland? - General. - Get me Group leader Muller, urgent, please. ... And I believe the general Weingster Third Army can relieve the pressure on Berlin Wing is well supplied and in his situation is ideal for counterattack - Hear it! Hear it,Keitel!Wing! Wing is our answer! .- But the wing is holding back, I ask permission to cut through the line and make contact with him and personally deliver your order for his army to attack. - So,there's some offensive spirit left. - Mein Furher,do not allow the treachery of a few defeatist -The defeatist! they are the enemy. - They are be eliminated - There are some on you Staff marshall.
