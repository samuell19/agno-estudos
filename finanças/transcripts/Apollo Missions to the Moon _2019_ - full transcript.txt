- [Alex] The world cheered when the first Apollo crew set foot upon the moon and returned safely to Earth. (drum and trumpet music) Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Mike Collins had fulfilled one of the most audacious dreams in the history of human exploration. The exploits of the Apollo astronauts were well-known. Few knew at the time that what they saw, what they found, would touch off a chain reaction in science delivering a new understanding of how the planets formed, how the moon was born, (orchestral music) and how Earth and life emerged. These findings, along with the recent discovery of water on the moon, are rebooting Apollo's loftiest vision, to launch new generations of human exploration. Six times in four-and-a-half years, Apollo spacecraft will coast over a pocked lunar surface and descend onto dusty plains. 12 astronauts will climb out to experience the moon up close. On tightly choreographed excursions, they set up experiments, made measurements, and collected rocks as they walked or drove across the alien terrain. These heroic missions teased a daring new era of exploration and achievement. The investment poured into researching how to get safely to and from the moon would act as an accelerant for technologies that increasingly shape modern life, computation, communications, electronics, robotics. But it's the science produced in the wake of Apollo, that will increasingly define its legacy. The quest to study the moon was a fundamental goal of the Space Age. (piano music) The Soviets developed the giant N1 launcher intended to send cosmonauts beyond Earth orbit. The N1 never succeeded in any of its four launches. It's second attempt crashed back in one of the largest ever human-made and non-nuclear explosions. The American lunar program pinned its hopes on the mighty Saturn 5 rocket. (engine roaring) - We shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food, and survival on an untried mission to an unknown celestial body. And do all this, and do all this, and do it right. (engine roaring) (adventurous orchestral music) - [Alex] In 13 launches, the U.S. heavy lift launch vehicle never failed to safely deliver its payload. The first human-rated launch carried the Apollo 8 command module into lunar orbit. - [Houston] Roger, safe journey guys. - [Jim] We'll see you on the other side. - [Alex] Alone, behind the moon and out of touch with Earth, Apollo 8 astronauts fired their single engine proving the critical maneuver for American missions to return. - [Frank] Oh my God! Look at that picture over there! Here's the Earth coming up. Wow, is that pretty! - [Alex] This moon shot gave a war-weary, conflict-ridden United States something to cheer about. And set the stage for humankind's greatest adventure. - [Houston] Ignition sequence started. Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. All engines running, lift off. We have a lift off. 32 minutes across the hour. Lift off on Apollo 11. - [Alex] On July the 16th, Apollo 11 blasts off. - [Houston] Tower clear. - [Neil] Roger, we got a roll program. - [Houston PAO] Neil Armstrong reporting the roll and pitch program, which puts Apollo 11 on a proper heading. - [Alex] Neil Armstrong serves as the mission commander. Buzz Aldrin would pilot the lunar module Eagle down to the moon's surface. Michael Collins pilots the command module. It takes three days for Apollo 11 to cross the nearly 400,000 kilometers between Earth and moon. On July the 19th, Collins fires the command module's rockets and Apollo 11 enters lunar orbit. - [Neil] Well there is some rough country over there. Something really separate that was. (soft music) - [Alex] The next day, Armstrong and Aldrin enter the Eagle lander to begin their descent. - [Mike] You cats take it easy on the lunar surface. If I hear you huffing and puffing, I'm going to start bitching at you. - [Buzz] Okay Mike. - [Alex] Spurious radar data flood the lunar module's computer triggering five separate alarms. - [Buzz] Okay good buddy, let's hang tight and look for landing radar. - [Neil] We'll need that landing radar by 18,000 with this soundtrack program alarm, 1202, 1202, give us a reading on the 1202 program alarm. We're going netfly. If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be gold. He's taking it in (mumbles). - [Houston] Roger, we got you. We're going at alarm. - [Alex] Each time, mission control deems it safe to press on. - [Houston] Okay, all flight controllers gonna go for landing. Retro? - [Retro] Go. - [Houston] FIDO? - [FIDO] Go. - [Houston] Guidance? - [Guidance] Go. - [Houston] Control? - [Control] Go. - [Houston] Telcomm? - [Telcomm] Go. - [Houston] GNC? - [GNC] Go. - [Houston] EECOM? - [EECOM] Go. - [Houston] Surgeon? - [Surgeon] Go. - [Houston] Capcomm, we're a go for landing. - [Mike] Eagle, Houston, you're a go for landing, over. - [Alex] The moon's gravity is uneven. That causes the Eagle lander to pick up some extra velocity. - [Buzz] (static) velocity. Standard speed down, three-and-a-half, 47 forward. - [Alex] The astronauts sail past their ideal landing zone. - [Buzz] Four-and-a-half down, five-an-a-half down. (intense music) - [Alex] Flying above a field of boulders as big as houses and running low on fuel, Armstrong takes manual control searching for a clean spot to touch down. - [Astronaut] Three-and-a-half down, nine forward, hypervents, 95, 875 feet, it's looking good, down a half. - [Houston] 60 seconds. - [Buzz] 60 seconds, lights on. Down two-and-a-half. Forward, forward. Good. Bring your feet down, two-and-a-half picking up some dust. Three feet, two-and-a-half down, (mumbles). - [Neil] Now at the 30. - [Buzz] Pull forward, pull forward, head to the right a little. 30 seconds, down a half. 30 seconds, forward, good. Back light. - [Neil] Okay, engine stop. ETA on descent. Both control, both auto (mumbles) engine command override off. Engine is on off. 113 is in. - [Houston] We copy you down Eagle. - [Neil] A quality day here, the Eagle has landed. - [Alex] About six and a half hours later, Neil and Buzz set foot upon the moon. - [Neil] The surface appears to be very fine-grained as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. I'm going to step off the lam now. (piano music) That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. - [Buzz] Are you going to get the contingency sample? - [Neil] Right. - [Alex] Armstrong quickly grabs a contingency sample. - [Neil] I'll try to get a rack in here. Just be careful. - [Alex] If they should have to leave quickly, they won't go home empty-handed. - [Neil] (mumbles) all it's own. It's like in the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. - [Alex] Armstrong and Aldrin now set out to gather rocks and lunar soil, the first samples plucked by human hands from the surface of the moon. The astronauts find themselves on a strange gray world filled with optical illusions and unexpected juxtapositions. With no atmosphere to diffuse it, the sunlight is harsh with shadows cast in deep black. - [Buzz] I look around here, the contrast in general is completely by virtue of the shadows. - [Alex] Only the lander, the experimental gear, and the Earth offer swatches of color. - [Mike] Neil and Buzz, the President of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you, over. - [Alex] Aldrin places a seismometer, beginning a long study of the moon's interior. Recordings of myriad moonquakes show us that, even today, as heat from the moon's formation slowly dissipates, Earth's companion is steadily shrinking. - [Buzz] Beautiful, beautiful. - [Neil] Ain't that something? A magnificent sight out here. - [Buzz] (mumbles) ventilation. Hey Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks? - [Neil] Find a purple rock? - [Buzz] Yep. Anything more, before I head on up? - [Neil] Head on up the ladder Buzz. - [Buzz] Adios amigo. - [Neil] Okay. - [Alex] The first Apollo crew lifted off the moon aboard the Eagle lander with two boxes of lunar rocks and dirt weighing 21.55 kilograms. - [Buzz] I'm showing a good bit out of plane velocity on my cross finders Mike. - [Mike] Roger, I have no indication of it. - [Buzz] Okay Mike, I'll get in position here and then you got it. - [Alex] Just under four hours later, they docked with the command module Columbia for the journey home. Over the next four decades, Apollo samples would take scientists back in time helping them to piece together one of the most dramatic stories ever told, the birth of the moon and the rise of planet Earth as we know it today. Among the major findings of the Apollo missions is that rocks from Earth and the moon share particular forms of oxygen that scientists regard as blood types for solar system bodies. This means the two worlds must share a common history. A picture of the moon's deep past began to emerge, some of it written right on its face. Several large old craters are surrounded by concentric rings. You can see them in this image of a feature called the Mare Orientale. These circles are of the type that might have been created had a giant impact just splashed down long ago on a roiling red hot liquid surface. The first people on the moon encountered relatively light rocks strewn about the landing site, probably forced upward by heavier material sinking toward the moon's core. These clues suggest that early in its history, the moon's surface was a vast ocean of molten magma. The second Apollo mission would bring this idea into sharp relief. November the 19th, 1969, Pete Conrad and Alan Bean distend toward a region called Oceanus Procellarum, or Ocean of Storms. This vast plain is covered in a thick layer of solidified magma, perhaps unleashed by a large ancient impact. - [Pete] Very good, very good. - [Alan] Looks good Pete. - [Pete] Hey there it is, there it is. Son of a gun, right down the middle of the road. - [Alan] Outstanding, 42 degrees Pete. - [Alex] They're homing in on Surveyor 3, a robotic lander that touched down in April 1967. (light piano music) The idea is to get within walking distance but not so close that it covers Surveyor with dust. - [Alan] You're looking good. - [Pete] We got that crater right where it's supposed to be. You're beautiful, 257 feet, coming down in five. - [Alex] Conrad decides to come down 177 meters short of Pete's parking lot to avoid rough terrain ahead but still a safe 360 meters from Surveyor. - [Alan] Coming down in two, Pete. You've got plenty of gas, plenty of gas dude, hang in there. - [Houston] 30 seconds. - [Pete] Coming down in two. - [Alan] He's got it made. Come on in there. - [Pete] Contact lights. - [Houston] Roger, copy contact. - [Pete] Okay, (static) off. (mumbling among static) - [Alan] Good landing Pete, outstanding man. - [Alex] Now on the moon, they unmount Surveyor's TV camera and other parts to take back for analysis. Later, the detection of streptococcus bacteria on Surveyor's parts will suggest that microbes can survive years in space. This leads NASA to purposely destroy the Galileo mission to Jupiter in 2003 and the Cassini mission to Saturn in 2017 to avoid contaminating moons that may be ripe for life. On the lunar surface, Conrad and Bean pick up a rock eventually nicknamed, KREEP, for its constituents, potassium, rare Earth elements, and phosphorus. These highland specimens are a rock type called anorthosite a product of a molten surface, its presence is another clue to the origin of the moon. Before Apollo, scientists entertained a range of theories on where the moon came from, it's a proto-planet snagged by Earth as it passed by; or that formed right along side the Earth at the same time; it's what remains of debris scattered by an asteroid large enough to carve out the Pacific Ocean; or from rocks that exploded into space when radioactive materials sunk to the center of the Earth. (thundering) The 12 people who walked the lunar surface saw nothing that could, by itself, solve the mystery of the moon's formation. Had they left with only photographs and memories, we might never know. Instead, they brought home rocks and made meticulous records of their context. Those rocks take us back to a time 4.5 billion years ago. Within the kingdom of the sun a gravitational battle rages amongst nascent planets, a young hot Earth is growing slowly, drawing asteroids and dust into its body. A proto-planet, the size of Mars, crosses its path. It has an iron core and a silicate mantle. Theia is on a collision course with Earth. As this computer simulation shows it deals a glancing blow, tearing away about a third of Earth's mass and leaving the remainder spinning rapidly. The impact envelops Earth in a dense atmosphere of super hot vaporized rock. Much of the wreckage falls back in a rain of fiery impacters. About a 1/100th of Earth's former mass now lies in a disc eventually settling into a lumpy ring. This debris ring gradually breaks up and over about a century's time, coalesces into a single sphere. The surface of this new moon is a hot magma ocean. Anorthosite rock floats to the surface, slowly hardening into a crust. For hundreds of millions of years, that crust will be battered by impacts large and small. (piano music) The craters we see today bear witness to this violent age. 4.51 billion years after the moon was born explorers would step onto this surface on a journey into it's past and into that of Earth. Apollo 14's Alan Shepard and Ed Mitchell step into a confusing realm, littered with ancient creek rock specimens. They head toward the rim of Cone crater, on the hunt for rocks from the lunar interior blasted out by an impact. Many contain chemical traces of multiple impact events in which rocks melt and recombine to make mashups known as breccias. Unlike Earth where weather and erosion have erased evidence of all but the largest impacts, the moon retains a detailed record of bombardment in myriad craters, boulders, jagged rocks, and lunar bedrock smashed into fine powder. The film from Apollo missions shows astronauts bouncing along with seeming ease in a low lunar gravity. In reality, exploring the moon is hard work. Spacesuits made rigid by the very air the astronauts need to breathe, restrict bending at the waist, knees, and elbows. Yet, these soldiers of science were tasked with maneuvering complex instruments. - [Alan] Oh, dag-gummit. - [Alex] With chipping off and picking up rocks. - [Alan] Okay base, open the bag. - [Alex] And with driving core tubes down into ancient densely compacted soil. - [Jim] Stop! - [Dave] Okay. - [Jim] Well you see that one went all the way in. - [Dave] Not quite. - [Jim] Well I can't get over those lineations of layering in Mount Hadley. - [Dave] Boy I can't either, that's really spectacular, it's beautiful. - [Alex] On the next mission, Apollo 15, the astronauts are given electric drills to take deeper core samples. - [Dave] Well it's a great massage. I'm not putting any force on it at all. It pulls itself down in. - [Alex] NASA has ramped up it's science goals so the surface daytime is extended. Dave Scott and Jim Irwin complete 18 hours of moon walking and moon driving in the first powered lunar rover. - [Dave] Okay Joe I'm going to put the TV on the rover now, cable's connected. - [Alex] Wheeled mobility proves key to the scientific bounty. - [Dave] Jim we're heading three-two-zero bearing three-five-zero and range is 4.3. - [Jim] Man, that's the most organized mountain I've ever seen (laughs). - [Dave] Yeah they're so uniform in width you know. - [Alex] Their landing site lies near a collapsed lava tube called Hadley Rille. - [Houston] Five to 3,000 feet, five to... - [Alex] It's a huge extrusion of hot magma that wormed it's way across the surface then cooled and hardened. Later on, the roof collapsed exposing it's hollow interior. - [Jim] Wow, look at those large blocks on that west wall. - [Alex] This long sinuous conduit is similar to features made by volcanoes here on Earth. But Hadley Rille is much larger, 135 kilometers long, thanks to the moon's much lower gravity. Lava tubes like this could make naturally shielded habitats for future lunar citizens. - [Jim] Look at that, guess what we just found? Guess what we just found? I think we found what we came for. - [Dave] Bag it up. - [Alex] During their second excursion, the crew collects sample number 15415, an object that comes to be called the Genesis Rock. It takes scientists back 4 billion years to a time when the moon's surface was being pounded by giant asteroids and comets. The craters left by these clashes, still visible today, are a record of the pummeling Earth would have endured in the same period. This barrage of material is thought to be a main source for the water that dominates the surface of our planet. The next moon shot pushes deeper into this ancient period. - [Charlie] Okay fuel is good, 10%, there comes the shadow. A perfect place over here John, a couple of big boulders. (mumbles) three looking super. Give me one click up. Okay, back it up slightly. Okay, two down, standby for contact. - [Alex] Apollo 16 touches down in a region far from previous landings to get better triangulation on seismic data and to explore higher elevation terrain. Until Apollo, most theorists believed the lunar highlands were built by ancient volcanoes. Astronauts John Young and Charlie Duke quickly cast doubts on this hypothesis. In more than 20 hours of prospecting, the pair finds almost nothing of volcanic origin. Instead, the surface of the moon appears to be all about impacts. Duke and Young bag two samples that will turn out to be the largest and oldest found, 4.44 billion years, almost as old as the moon itself. (eerie music) - [Jim] Endeavor's on time. - [Houston] Roger, we saw lift off. - [Jim] What a ride, what a ride. - [Al] Well that old visor with the glare shield really comes in handy. - [Alex] Beginning on Apollo 15, every ship has carried lunar mapping and panoramic cameras mounted outside. - [Al] Well that's a mapping camera and the Stellar Cover 4 is open and it's jamming up the handrail. - [Alex] It's the command module pilot's job to retrieve film cassettes because the service module will be jettisoned before reentering Earth's atmosphere. - [Al] Okay, here comes the mapping camera cover. Man the old moves out there. - [Alex] In the darkness of space, more than 315,000 kilometers from Earth, astronauts Al Worden, Ken Mattingly, and Ronald Evans will each see the moon shrink behind them as they rush toward Earth at more than 4,800 kilometers per hour. - [Al] That's her babe, right off the nose. - [Alex] The last Apollo targets a region where ancient and infant geology intersect, it is named Taurus-Littrow. - [Astronaut] Okay stand by for pitch over. Oh are we coming in, oh baby. There it is, proceeded. And there it is Houston, there's Camelot, wide ass target. - [Astronaut] I see it. - [Houston] Challenger you're a go for landing. - [Alex] Onto this mix of old and new terrain steps the Apollo Program's first and only practicing scientist, geologist Harrison Jack Schmitt. (soft piano music) The youngest material here comes from a huge crater far away, the bright feature called Tycho, known as the bellybutton of the moon. Analysis confirms that Tycho is the product of an asteroid strike 108 million years ago, very recent compared to the age of the moon. - [Harrison] Oh hey, there is orange soil. - [Gene] Well don't move it until I see it. - [Harrison] It's all over, orange. - [Gene] Crazy. - [Alex] Schmitt and his fellow moonwalker and mission commander Eugene Cernan also find particles of glass created in an ancient explosive eruption. - [Harrison] I've gotta dig a trench Houston. Fantastic sports fans. - [Alex] But is the moon still volcanically active today? To help find out, Apollo 17 has brought the first gravity measuring instrument, the transverse gravimeter, to give scientists a picture of what lies beneath the surface. The crew drills three meters down and 3.8 million years back into the lunar crust. - [Harrison] What am I doing down in here? - [Gene] What were you doing down in there (laughs)? - [Harrison] She's going in like she's into pretty good stuff. I'm not putting too much pressure on it. - [Gene] Boy the old fingers really do suffer on these. - [Alex] The 111 kilograms of cylindrical core sections they bring back to Earth will tell a story of hot rock, 200 kilometers below in the basement of the moon. (piano music) By the time the last Apollo astronauts splash down, the glow of Apollo had already begun to fade. Fearing the embarrassment of a catastrophe in space, the Nixon White House canceled the last three Apollo missions. But the Apollo Program left an indelible scientific and cultural footprint. Space has come to symbolize human ambition. An Apollo Saturn rocket up a stage was converted and launched as Sky Lab. (cheering) (fire roaring) NASA went on to build a partially reusable system to shuttle astronauts into low Earth orbit. The space-faring nations built the International Space Station to encourage political stability and prove cooperation. Work onboard ISS has advanced life support technologies. Meanwhile, private entrepreneurs launched satellites, building a robust industry supplying communications and navigation services. Still embracing exploration, public agencies led by NASA sent waves of robotic probes deep into the solar system. Two of them, the twin Voyager probes have now ventured into interstellar space. Space-based observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope projected our eyes and minds out into the universe at large. As this golden age of astronomy unfolded, it sparked a host of new questions for scientists laboring over bags of rocks and dirt brought back from the moon. The giant impact theory became the starting point for a rethinking of the Earth-moon relationship. In 2017, researchers applied new radio isotope dating techniques to samples from 1971's Apollo 14 mission. - [Harrison] Basically most of these boulders are the same brownish gray, at least we've seen one that was definitely almost white in color, a very definite difference in color which we'll document. We know beneath this dark brown regular there is a very light brown layer. - [Alex] This work placed the moon's birth at 4.51 billion years ago, fixing a date for an age of colliding proto-planets that built the solar system we see today. If the moon had been born much later, there would not have been enough time for the planet to cool and for life to arrive some 400 million years later. According to theory, Theia struck at an off angle that would have given Earth its tilt and set it spinning at a rate of once every five hours. Over the eons, as the moon's orbit widened, it gradually slowed Earth's spin to the 24 hours we experience today. (waves roaring) In the early days, ocean tides on our young planet were much larger and more frequent. As the Earth cooled, water sloshing onto volcanic islands would have encouraged chemicals to mix, forming more complex prebiotic compounds. (piano music) Moontides in turn, helped moderate and regulate the global climate by causing heat to flow from equator to pole. Without the pull of the moon's gravity, Earth would likely wobble by as much as 80 degrees. Imagine if every few thousand years as Earth changes its tilt, icebergs appeared in Ecuador and Senegal and tropical beaches in Iceland and Siberia. From the record of impacts held in the Apollo rocks, scientists began to imagine that water ice may be trapped in the deep shadows of polar craters. With no atmosphere to transport heat, these shadow lands would stay cold for millions if not billions of years. The first hints came in 1994. A probe named Clementine bounced radio signals off polar regions. The data were consistent with water molecules. Four years later, the lunar prospector picked up signatures of hydrogen associated with water at both lunar poles. In 2009, NASA's Lunar Crater Observation Sensing Satellite, LCOSS, aimed an impacter at Cabeas crater near the South Pole and then watched what was kicked up when it hit. The spectacular, unmistakable evidence of abundant water. (water rushes) Ancient lunar ice could be key to extending life beyond our home planet. Water is the enabler of space-based civilization, the far-reaching dream behind the Apollo Program. NASA has announced an ambitious plan to return people to the moon. However, the agency receives less than 1/8 the annual funding it got during Apollo which cost more than $110 billion in today's dollars. At the same time, private companies have begun to assume the mantle of space development. The techniques proven by Project Apollo are showing them the way. Entrepreneurs are investing now because they foresee a vibrant space industrial economy. And the businesses that will drive it are rooted in the enormous resources available on the lunar surface. At just 69 hours away by chemical rocket, the moon is our most likely extraterrestrial base. It has a natural power source, the sun. The sunlit lunar day length is equivalent to two weeks on Earth. A system of solar energy farms arranged around the moon's equator could supply constant power. - [Harrison] And I'm picking up several pieces of really breccicular rock out here now. - [Alex] Silicon and oxygen extracted from the soil could be fashioned into photovoltaic cells. Solar energy plants built of lunar materials could be ferried to Earth orbit or interplanetary locations. Solar-powered rovers could crawl non-stop around the moon. Apollo samples show the lunar surface is rich in metals for building, iron, titanium, and aluminum, and fine silicon-laden dirt to make cement. Lunar prospectors will likely find gold, platinum group, and rare Earth metals. The 1967 United Nations Outer Space Treaty precludes any Earth nation from claiming the moon as sovereign territory but it does not prevent private companies from staking mining claims. The body of law governing how the moon will develop is in its infancy. Government space agencies may at first lead the lunar reboot but they probably won't manage it over time. A politically neutral body, a lunar authority may be needed to guide the long-term vision and planning and to keep the peace should a lunar land rush begin. It's dusty surface is a new frontier. The old moon made us what we are. Even as the memory of Apollo fades, the bright light of this new moon calls us to venture again to its shores (adventurous orchestral music) and beyond. (soft piano music)
