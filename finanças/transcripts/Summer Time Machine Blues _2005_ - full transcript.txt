Oh, no! Now you've done it! Apologize! Or you'll change into a water-sprite, too. Bow to it! Kowtow! How was it, Ito? Did you capture us? Perfectly. In all your youth! Good shots? Great! Sci-Fi Club It's the uniforms that do it! Worn only twice... You get bored. I'll do them now. Cool! We didn't play bad, though... You'd never think we were sci-fi nerds. I amazed myself. I didn't know I could move like that. 3-on-3 baseball's hard work! There's no point loading the bases. There's no one to bat! And one of our team was a dog! Who runs away with the ball. Let's go. We should've brought clothes. And not been such eager beavers to get here. 'Eager-Beaver Baseball'! Your favorite game. - 'Eager-Beaver Baseball'! - Aw, shuddup. Save energy...save energy... Save energy. Just stay like that. That's the hardest thing to do. You're not too close? That's real close... I'm trying to bring out the fascination of my subject... You're still really close. It's touching me. That's OK? Yep! Got a good one. Oasis Public Bath Don't you guys have anywhere else to go? No! And stop peeking! That stinks! Now I can die happy! I never want to leave! Wasn't the baseball shoot today? What happened? It's gone! What? My Vidal Sassoon. What? Your shampoo? You took it! You guys took it! No no no no! We didn't! Don't look at me! You use Vidal Sassoon? I didn't even know. Then... ...was it you?! Give back my Vidal Sassoon! Give it back! Quiet, Two-pairs! I'll kick you out of here! Then where will you go? Quiet, Two-pairs! Who took my Vidal Sassoon?! Give it a rest! I can't wash my hair without Vidal Sassoon! You just like saying the name! Vidal Sassoon's wasted on that hair. I've got a stop to make. Where? I've got something to do, too. Matsui Pharmacy Matsui Udon Did You See That UFO? Excuse me... Hello. Uh, this film... You're interested? Yeah. Be right out. What's it about? You've found yourself a great film! It's a sci-fi B-movie. Two office workers are kidnapped by aliens... ...and sit there waiting to see what's going to happen. A real B-movie. A C-movie, even. The great thing about it is that it's boring. Really boring. Great, huh? Hot, isn't it. It sure is! Soga! Aren't you at work? Work? Were you late? Did you get fired? What do you mean? Hey, it happens! You can always find a job. If you work too hard... You'll drop dead. What was that all about? I don't know! Phweet! Ishimatsu! What the hell's that?! Gin-Gin! From the drug store? I've had my eye on it! It's because of you this place getting so cramped! OK? Listen... ...if we put it here it can be... ...a watchman. There? And a mascot. It's not much of a mascot! No! What's wrong? It's locked. Locked? The caretaker? Maybe... Where's the spare key? In the box. Huh? When did you get here? Don't barge in here! You got to see this! Come on! Ow! That hurts! There's no one there. You brought a wash-basin! So you're going to do it! The full production?! What? Right! Let's have it! He's really going to! Really? What? You know what! The dance! You use the basin, and you go like this, and then like this! The remote! Sorry! What did you do?! This stinks! You're a disaster! Is it OK? I don't know! What's going on?! The remote? Yeah! It got busted yesterday. It got Coke spilled on it. You want me to fix it? Well, you're our staff adviser... I'll see what I can do. But I'm not on vacation, you know. Please! Hot, huh? Eager-Beaver Baseball Yeah, it's hot! It's too hot to think! Which makes it even hotter! It's too hot for 'Othello'! Then don't play it. You busted the remote! I didn't break it! We all did! This heat's going to kill me! Why didn't... ...they put a switch right on the unit?! So near and yet so far... Let's bring Gin-Gin in. Why? He'll make it cooler. Visually. No no no no... He won't. That's not cool, it's weird. All the junk you bring back makes the place hotter. Isn't there anywhere cool? Nope. Not around here. Not even a convenience store! Be winter, damn it! You're mad at summer? I'm mad at you! I didn't do it! I'm boiling! The darkroom's hot, too! So the Camera Club got chased out of the big room? Yep. We had both, but not enough members... ...so the Sci-Fi Club took it over. We got stuck in that hot, smelly darkroom. With more members we'd get it back? Yep. See you. Look! Now Niimi's out staring at the external unit! Like he's trying to suck the cool right out of it! He lacks cool! Isn't the cooler back on yet? The store says the remote's too old to fix. What? So Jose's taking a look at it. He'll never do it. Or make professor. I'll bet he can't even get it open! Maybe someone threw out a fan. Check the garbage... Aren't you going? No. A treasure trove! But aren't these all broken? Let's try some! It's so hot! Got much free time these days? No. No? Our exhibition's next month. When school starts again... Yeah. We're hoping to get a few more members... I thought if you had some time, I got these free movie tickets... ...good till next week. No, thanks. Why not? It's not fair to your girlfriend. Girlfriend? The one from yesterday. Mine? Don't get cute. I don't have one. What are you talking about? After all that talk yesterday... Me? All of you. I still don't understand what that was all about... Oh! Hi. Your pictures are done. Plugged in. Then allow me. It doesn't work. A bit slow. That doesn't look safe. Next. Well, it spins... Not much breeze. What happened? I don't know. Here goes. It's a heater! You knew that! How about this? It says 'cold noodles'. 'Cool heads'. Hmm... It just jumps out at you. There's not much feeling of action there... There wasn't any. No? The theme is 'laughter'. A certain stupidity comes out when people are getting desperate. That's what I wanted. What I mean is... ...you don't seem to have much of a sense of distance. None. No One Here Student Office Oh, come on! They're never help. We need a cooler! It's like... ...they're never ever there. Do they really exist? You dig and dig, and you never find anything. What's the matter? Urn... ...uh... "GT... Now what? Who's he? Urn, this is... ...the Sci-Fi Club, isn't it. Well, yeah... But who are you? Uh...excuse me! 'Bye! What a loser! Does he want to join? It's summer vacation! We've got to keep guys like that out! The Sci-Fi Club is not for losers! He probably even reads Sci-Fi! What's that? What? Isn't this weird? Where? Here. Yeah! A ghost? But he's alive... You brought this, didn't you. No. Do you ride it? Lift that. - Should we? - Sure. Yeah? Like this... Then this... This is a dial. See? This the month, and this is the day... And then... ...'Future'...'Past'. Then there's a lever... Yeah... What? This is... ...a time machine! So... ...there's a time machine in the Sci-Fi Club. A practical joke! We fell for it! Who was it?! They did a great job! Maybe it was that guy! 'Mushroom'! That bastard! We caught him in the act! Soga... ...get on it. Why me? We have to respond! You said you wanted to be a pilot. It's written right here! Go and make us cool! Please! I'll never make it. Too bad! A perfect fit...not! You put me here! Should we send him back in time? One day back... Then give that lever a pull. This area is dangerous! Stand back! OK, OK. If it'll cool you guys out, I'll do it. I'm serious! I'm going. Time travel! Hey... ...what happened? I don't know. Soga? Soga! Soga? Knock, will you! Is Soga here? No! He just went 'zip!' and disappeared! Soga? Soga! What happened to you? Where were you? When is this? Is today yesterday or today? Soga? He's disoriented. Is today today? Calm down! Today's today! What happened? Yesterday... I just went back to yesterday on this time machine! Time machine? Everything went all wavy, and it was yesterday. - Wavy? - Yeah! Everything went wavy! Take it easy! What happened? When I pulled that lever... ...everything went all distorted, and you were all gone! Gone? We were? I saw us all playing baseball... ...looking like idiots. That was yesterday... That's where I went! And then? I thought, 'Oh, shit!' and ran back to the machine... ...pushed the lever to 'future'. Then everything went wavy again, and it was now. I'll kick your ass! It's true! You try it! Hey hey hey...look! Is that you? Yeah! Just a few minutes ago! There's two of you! That's me yesterday, and me watching me. Look at the clothes! It's true! This is absolute proof! Photographic evidence. Yes! Which means... It's real! Wow! What the hell?! We can time-travel! Really? Things go all wavy! We've got a picture! How did it get here? I don't know. 'Mushroom'! Who was he?! What are you doing? Urn... "GT... ...why is that there? I told you yesterday! Yesterday? You're as dumb as your brother! Brother? Isn't he here today? You're the caretaker?! Who else? It hurts? You're young... The river-sprite... It's the heat... Well, it looks like a time machine. How does time travel feel? Really horrible. Horrible? Like being turned inside-out. So you're... ...a time traveler! You did it! Not because I wanted to. So you were already there yesterday... I already knew everything... ...that was going to happen. That's weird! There were two of you? I had no idea! We were all into the game! It sounds backwards. Like he got there after he'd arrived. Forget the hard stuff. The question now is... ...when to? Excuse me... Sorry. Uh, hello? Urn... Go away! Excuse me! Excuse me, but... ...when is it now? I don't have a watch. About 2. No, what I mean is, what year of what emperor's reign? Heisei... Heisei? Hmm, what year is it? We should go back to caveman times. Why not the Jurassic? That's too far all at once. The dial only goes to 99 years. How about the future? No, I don't think so. I'd be scared. What if it turned out you were dead? Maybe I'll go back and do Grade 9 over again. It doesn't work that way. You can't go back to Grade 9. But can you really get back here from way in the past? We've only tried it once. If that happened, you'd have to just live back then. And be found as a fossil! All right, then...yesterday. Once more. To see how it works. We could send Kecha first... No no no no. How will he get back? You want to send a dog after I've gone? Yesterday, huh? So we'd arrive at the same time yesterday? Yeah... I think so. There's no 'hour' dial? Well, we were playing baseball about this time... I've got an idea! I'll go back and get the remote before it was broken! Yeah! It wasn't broken yet! I'm brilliant! The master-thief! Mount up! Are you all going? We can't all fit. Grab on here. That looks hot! You guys go first. But just get it and come right back. Count on it! We'll be back in a flash! Should you be going from here? It's the same room. You might bump into them. Yeah! And they'd freak. Well... Away you go- Hurry back. I know! Ready? Which way? - Down. - Up's future. Ready! Look out, Kecha. Out of the way! Come on! Hurry UP! Let's go! OK! Here goes! Wow! With a bang! Wow! It all went wavy! Well? They're not here! Nor's Kecha! Which means... Yesterday! The same as yesterday! - Don't! - It's OK! Let's go inside! Just like yesterday! So now they're looking around? Watching the baseball? What? What? Then they'll go... Gin-Gin's not here! ...'Gin-Gin's not here!' He hasn't arrived yet! We're in the past! He was still at the drug store! Guys! Here's why we came. The remote! The busted remote! It works! That's what I've been missing! And now the men of the future steal it away! Mission accomplished. Because...times change. Come here! Men of the future were here. We can't do that! I confess! How did it go, Ito? Did you capture us? Perfectly. In all your youth! Good shots? They're back! Oh, shit! Where are they?! What are they doing? Fooling around. Urn... You! This is still the Sci-Fi Club room, isn't it... Wait... Who are you? Tamura. Tamura? You know him? He's 'Mushroom'. Well, actually... ...I'm an Sci-Fi Club member, too. You are? What do you mean? Don't be too surprised when you hear this... Don't not 'react', but... Just tell us. Well, I seem to have come here by time travel. Time travel?! From the year 2030. So you're from the Sci-Fi Club of the future? Yes! A junior member! Glad to be here. Not so fast! anyway- -- ...what is that time machine? Are you that advanced? We don't understand it, either. You don't? We came in this morning and there it was. That machine? We all thought someone was playing a joke... - - - so We all had a good laugh and they put' me on if. And with his camera hanging round his neck! The pervert from the future! Up from the country! And going back! So we set the dials, and I pulled the lever... ...and here I am! Just like we did! So it's not from your time... Or from yours... It wasn't here before. I don't get it... So where is it now? It was right here... I should be getting back. It's kind of not here right now... We thought we'd take a trip back to yesterday... Someone's using it? Well, we didn't know... BOY, Yo“ guys are brave! You rode it, didn't you? You came back 25 years. But what are they up to? I amazed myself. I didn't know I could move like that. 3-on-3 baseball's hard work! There's no point loading the bases. Do I really sound like that? What a dork! Let's go. We should've brought clothes. And not been such eager beavers to get here. 'Eager-Beaver Baseball'! Your favorite game. - 'Eager-Beaver Baseball'! - Aw, shuddup. Save energy...save energy... Save energy. So he's the future! You'd never know it. He seems kind of dorky... Hold your horses! I am of the future! And he talks old. And wears sandals. But Still... ...all this is so new! Older than now? Well, it's all been there for 25 years, you know. It hasn't changed?! Still the same room? Yes, indeed! Do you read Sci-Fi? Of course not! Nothing's changed! I don't even know what 'sci-fi' means! Me neither! You don't?! Urn, OK... ...let's take a tour. Of the past. Let's follow them. Our past selves. You mean it? Well? You know... ...it's hardly changed! This place never does! Well, it's still only 25 years... Yeah! What do you call that hairstyle? Doesn't it suit me? Yes, it does. Do they still have the 'Kappa' River-Sprite Festival? Yes, although I've always wondered... ...what a Kappa's got to do with this town. Good question! Why's it such a big deal? Damned if I know. Famous Films Theater Now, this place right here... ...is a convenience store now. It is? The theater's gone? Yes. That's not surprising. It could go out of business any day. That's a shock. It should still be here for a while yet. Oh? My mother used to come here a lot. Your mother? She went to this university, too. Maybe she's around here now. Yeah! She might be! But it might be better if you didn't meet her. She might decide she doesn't want to have kids. The future could change. It could change? If you change the past, the future changes, too. So if you change the past, the present changes? Yeah, that's how it would be. Somethings not right. What? They've gone back to get the remote control. But in reality it wasn't taken yesterday. A contradiction. You're talking sci-fi, aren't you. History just paints itself over. It does? The moment the past changes, you go... ...'Hey, the remote's been missing since yesterday.' That way everything fits. Wrong! Who said that?! You? Jose! Time's much more exact than that. This isn't 'Back to the Future', you know. Hey! Don't dis that film! I'm not. Your eyes are. Hands off! Whoa! We're just chatting... Fine! Let me give you a lecture. As the time-axis moves, this is yesterday... ...and this is today. You, yesterday... ...and you, today. This is extreme, but let's say you go back to yesterday... ...in order to kill your yesterday self. What happens? You can do that. No one's on guard against it. And then this future line ceases to exist. OK? This line disappears. So does my past self. In that case, who have I killed? Contradiction. Yes! Contradiction! There's no way this can be made to fit together. Now, in the same way, we have our time-axis. What if you go back and steal the remote from yourselves? You can do that. No one's on guard against it. Yes, and then... ...a contradiction arises. On one axis the remote is not stolen, and on another it is. Two time lines in one present. That cannot be! Then what happens? In theory, there cannot be... ...a time machine. But... Is that true? The premise is absurd. We know that. This is just fiction. Some people don't know! What's wrong with you? Why do you know so much about time machines? That's my field. Relativity... ...and time machines. I've studied it and studied it, and suddenly I'm over 40. I'm riding my own time machine, but it won't go into the past. This is getting to be a drag. If there was one, what would happen? There isn't one. But if there was, and the past changed... There isn't! If there was, and the past changed, it'd be like this. We'd vanish? We'd be a contradiction! Just over a remote? Time is a lot less forgiving than you think. What would vanish? Everything. Whatever's the matter? Just hurry! You're sad, aren't you. It's hot. You got to be here! 'The Three Musketeers' Oh, no! What are they doing?! I'll go get them. You Will? - You, too! - Me? You've been there. Just once! Take care! Come on! OK, but just this once! Bring them all back. Before the Coke spills. Here goes! Are we here? Soga? Wait... What's wrong? I'm dizzy... I hope they're OK... What was that? And don't say it was a time machine. It was a time machine. Impossible. It would violate the law of... ...cause and effect... That's the trouble. Weren't those two acting a little strange yesterday? What if... What? Maybe somethings happened... What are you doing?! I get car-sick. That was nothing! Wasn't the baseball shoot today? What happened? Nothing. Please... Go on in. Can I come in? Just a minute. So how was the shoot? Nothing we couldn't handle. No problem! Why are you standing? Well, we could sit... Or anything. Like this, or... I'm done. Thanks for everything. That was a quick bath. Bath? You changed clothes. Oh... Yeah, today was a quick one, wasn't it. Just in and out. Your wash-basin's not here. Yeah... We forgot them. Both of you? Well, you know...we're both kind of careless... We messed up! You made it! You, too? Where? What are you talking about?! We're here! What's going on? Cool it! How was it? How was the ride? Koizumi...no. You're getting carried away. Too long in the bath. What's with them? Somethings not right. What's the problem? What's your problem?! We're going to vanish! Where did you go? We tailed ourselves. What? From yesterday! Why did you bring that?! So we'll have twins. 'Alpha' and 'Omega'. - That won't work! - You steal it later! Because you didn't steal it now! Why? I don't know. Where's Niimi? The bath. Chasing his Vidal Sassoon. He's watching them? I think so. I never want to leave! I'll go get Niimi! Take care of these two. Hey. no! Dumb-ass! We'll vanish! You two go back. If we change the past, we'll all disappear. Explain that to me. I don't understand it! Twins? Please! You just want us to go... Thank you! I don't understand. It's outside. Just let me bring my game with me. No! Stop that! Can we move the rabbit? Stop changing the past! Or... Cut it out! Or start a game of Othello? And then... Send the machine back, OK? Just let me pet Kecha! Cut it out! Let's go! What are you doing?! You're today's Komoto? We've got to go back! - No way. - Way! We'll all vanish. But my Sassoon... Two pairs? They're lousy players! That's obvious. You'll need a caption. Yeah...something a little bit bluesy... ...but that still says 'summer'. This is deep shit! Why are you back? We heard. So why come back? We heard everything! What should we do? Nothing! How can we help? What should we do? Tamura! Why did you come?! I represent the future! You're just a normal guy! Put that down! Tell us! What should I do? You don't get it! What's this? What's going on? Uh, excuse me... Over there... What's going on? OK, where are we going now? It's OK for now. It's OK. It's OK... Oh, man! We've been seen! Now what?! Hide that thing! He's seen us! It's too late! Get on. Yeah, you're a pilot. That's what it says. What does that matter?! Just disappear! For 10 minutes. That's the maximum! No!!! Right! What was that?! Lightning? Soga? Please leave a message at the sound of the tone. It's me. We're done here. I'm heading over now. Let's go. Quiet, Two-pairs! I'll kick you out of here! Then where will you go? What's the matter? There was a time machine or something here... A time machine? Didn't see one. Oh, come on! It was right here! - Perhaps it was a dream. - Yeah? You're not tired? Me? There wouldn't be a time machine here! I know! Soga? I know Soga was here... He left. He just ran off. He said he has a part-time job. A job? He works his ass off. Yeah? Yes! Who's this? Your new friend. My...little brother. Oh, your brother? Of course! Of course... Komoto... 'Ya-dad.! Where'd you get that?! From the bath! Aw, man! Before whoever took it! No... ...you took it! Give back my Vidal Sassoon! So it was me! Do I feel small! I hope that's OK... Komoto! So you're on vacation, too... That's right. He came to see my school. See anything? I know all about the place. He's a living encyclopedia! Cut it out! Oh, well... ...there's a statue of a Kappa over there. The Kappa-- Why's it there? Well...it's kind of a long story... Years ago, this land was all a big swamp. It was deep and dangerous, and no one came near it. But one day a villager saw a child in the middle of it. So he ran to the village and brought everyone back. Now, prepare for a surprise! Right in front of everyone, there was a big 'Flash!. ...and the child vanished! It was... ...a Kappa! Amazing! So they built this statue? That's right! Anything you do to the Kappa comes back to haunt you! Whoa! That was close! Boy, did he change! You idiots! What are you doing?! Komoto! Why are you gabbing here?! We just missed disaster! The caretaker! Phweet! Niimi! 'Ya-dad.! That's... Apologies. Are you identical? Stop peeking! At least look at our faces! Now all we need is Soga. What's he doing? No, why did you come back? Where's the remote? It's not here. It was here a minute ago. It's not here. Wait a minute... it's got to be here! Yeah! If it's not here... Find it! Hold it! Stay calm. Search carefully. Why? Soga! What happened to you?! A swamp! A swamp? I went into a swamp 99 years ago! The Kappa one?! You went back 99 years? They forced me to go! It's like it took forever! Good thing you made it back! It's your fault! I just about drowned in the weeds! Did you see the remote? The remote? We can't find it. What? It's in the swamp. Where? I dropped it in the swamp! It's a Kappa! The Swamp God is angry! It's all my fault! We must raise a statue! What?! Do you know what you did?! Me? Go get it back! I can't! It's down in the weeds! What's the big problem?! You don't know? Just shut up, will you? Why? That'll change the past! We need another one. What's the problem? Komoto? It'll get busted anyway. Jose... ...give me the remote. I don't care if it's busted. I smashed it. That's OK... Smashed it? I got mad at it and bust it into pieces. The damn lid wouldn't... Komoto? Where were you? Jose's stupider than I thought. What happened? Let's bring it from yesterday! Then the same thing happens! Two days ago changes. You don't get it, either. Sure I do! What we need is the remote for this, isn't it. Well, yeah. Right! Where are you going? I've got an idea. Tamura? Back soon! He's here! There. Thanks. Really. Get going! Oh, yuck! I'm on my way. Is this it? Where did you get that? I went to the winter of 2030 and got it. 2030? From us, four months into our future. There's no problem going there, right? Why was it there? We're still using it. That The same air conditioner? Yes! No new one? That lasted a while! A quarter-century! Anyway, please accept this. So we should do this... Wipe off the grime of all those years! Oh, man! There it is! Mission accomplished? Well done! Who'd've expected that? That it was there in the future! What's this all about? What about next summer? The cooler won't work. That's OK. The Student Office finally buys us a new one. It really exists? 25 years from now, they find someone there! So use it all you like. So you went in winter... After we'd finished with the cooler. That was smart! For such a dork! People of this age are so rude! No, we're not. You are a dork. Anyway, we've got to get back! Komoto'll be here soon. All at once? Wait, wait...me? Yeah, you. You came back first. When? Yesterday! You changed clothes. What are you talking about? You guys got back first. I was out shopping. I'll kick your ass. I mean it. Wait... It's because of you this place is getting so cramped! OK? Listen... ...if we put it here it can be... ...a watchman. There? They're back! I told you! Lock the door! What's wrong? It's locked. Locked? Here goes! Can I fit on? You all came at once? Komoto? Right here. How did you get there?! I never came back. Huh? What are you doing? Me? Nothing. You're back? Yeah. You changed clothes. How? You didn't bring a change. I went home and changed. There and back. Why lock the door? Yeah, why? Well, I went home, got some clothes... ...then changed here. What's up with that? Change at home! I just felt like it. Well, I'll be going. No no no no! What?! I smell a rat. You're hiding something. Like What? You're... ...meeting a woman! No, I'm not. You don't fool us! The clothes are proof! You brought clothes to change into and go! Case closed! No, I didn't! I already have incontrovertible proof! What? You didn't know it, but the message you thought you left for a girl... ...is on my cell phone! It's me. We're done here. I'm heading over now. Aren't you the sneaky one! How do you explain that? 'It's me. We're done here. I'm heading over now.' Who is she? OK, I admit it. So...let me go. Traitor! No way! I'm late! OK! Let's let him go. We're not bad people. But in return, you pay a penalty! I know! The 'naked dance'! Penalty for what? For playing games with us, that's what! You're a Judas! Atone! Later, OK? Now! Right now! Don't barge in here! You got to see this! Come on! Ow! That hurts! Don't bring them! Here we are. Take it off! What's this? Oh, OK. Komoto presents 'the naked dance'. What?! A penalty for having a date. - Really? - Yes! OK, OK. Just listen... What? I've really got to go. To meet this girl? Yeah. So... ...'bye. There's no way we're letting you go now! Now it's like this! And this! I'll take pictures. Well, it's too late now. I'll introduce you. She's here? Where? Where? Where? There's no one there. You brought a wash-basin! So you're going to do it! The full production?! What? Right! Let's do it! He's really going to! Really? What? You know what! The dance! You use the basin, and you go like this, and then like this! The remote! Sorry! What did you do?! This stinks! You're a disaster! Is it OK? I don't know! What's going on?! This is. So it's all back to normal... It was a mess, let me tell you! Yeah, and Coke on the remote! The girl was just a figment of their imagination. I'm exhausted. That stinks! You all came at once? Komoto? Right here. How did you get there?! I never came back. He spent 24 hours hidden in this locker. Why? I just jumped in there to get out of the way... ...but you guys never left so I had to stay in there all through. And he fell asleep in there. Yeah. Be winter, damn it! What woke me up was Niimi freaking out today. So when did you come out? Komoto? Komoto? So you spent all day in that locker? Yeah. It was boiling! There were two of you? That means there's two of you now? There were for a while... ...but one of us went back to the past, and can't return. 'Cause I'm the one who's come back. Who doesn't understand? So he goes to yesterday like this... ...and can't come back. So he stays in the locker, and now he's here... So that means we don't have to go get him? I'm here, aren't I? So that means everything's OK? All is Well. So we won't vanish! It sure had me worried! But we still don't have the remote. Just like before. Aw, what the hell. Is that 'maturity'? He's lived a day more than you. Yeah... In there. And it's a lot cooler out here. Kecha... What's that? A remote? Look! How? He must've found it. In the swamp! I put this tape around it! Swamp? This came out of the swamp! By time travel? No. It came out of the mud, after 99 years! You mean Kecha dug it up? Yes! He's always out there digging. Really? Looking for that? Look! It's our remote control! Buried there for 99 years? That's right. Let's see... ...if it works. Way to go! It'll never work. Mud wouldn't preserve it that well. A 99 year-old remote... It's on! Wow! How?! The tape? Why did you tape it? To keep the Coke off it. We couldn't bring it back. You shouldn't have. The past would change. Didn't you realize? You're right! No, no, I understand! Still, the cooler works. Mission accomplished! So this remote... ...is a bridge to the future! What do you mean? First... ...yesterday Soga takes it 99 years into the past. It stays buried for all that 99 years. Then Kecha digs it up. It gets used for another 25 years. Then, in the winter of 2030, Tamura takes it back to yesterday. It gets Coke spilled on it. And finally, I smash it. This is an amazing phenomenon of time! You're not listening. Ah, the cool! We have opened up the future. Well... ...I'm sorry to be so abrupt... ...but I'll be going now. You're leaving? I'm sure everyone will be worried about me. Yeah? Yeah, you just disappeared... Yes... Go back a day early. Then hide somewhere, and come out after you vanish. Yeah, that's right. Then they won't worry. Does that mean I won't get older while I'm here? No no no... You'll get older. Sure I will! Why up here? To make it special. Well, thanks for everything. Come back and visit. Thank you. Just don't change the past. So don't come back very much. Don't come at all. People of this age are so rude! Good bye! Take care! And now... ...farewell! He's gone. Still talking like the old days. He was a strange one. I still have the feeling I'll see him again. He'll come and visit? I don't know... But after an experience like that... One trip in time is enough to last you a while. Like, your whole life? anyway- -- ...what's a time machine, anyway?! Yeah, that's right. Fiction, that's what! Gone in the summer sky. You know what? Don't be shocked... What? Maybe nothing would have changed. Isn't it more logical to think everything's decided from the start? But if we hadn't gone, everything would be different. Maybe even that... ...was decided, too. BY Who? God, maybe... God? It's impossible that He exists. Why 'He'? What are you writing? I want to build a time machine. Build one? One exists in the future, therefore someone built it. I'll try to be the one. I'll just slip into the role. Just like you got the cooler working. Alone again... You stink of swamp, you know. You dropped me in there! Why did you go back 99 years? It just happened. They just spun the dial. They did? It was awful! There were all these people there... I barely made it back alive! Does that mean... ...you're the Kappa?! --.You're the Kappa?! That's crazy! Stand beside it! “'8 you! Like this? Right out of the swamp! Yeah! You're not joining in? Too much excitement for me. I'll go get a tape writer. Ah, that's nice... Hey, isn't this Tamura's? Did he forget it? There's a film... Pictures of the future? Haruka has one like this. Shibata? Tamura! Sorry. That's mine. Thanks. If I lose this, my mom will be furious. Your mom? She used it years ago, then she gave it to me. Thank you very much. I won't be back. Goodbye. Wait... Does this mean... Seriously? We'd better not tell her. That'd be a shock. But we know her husband's name. I wonder what he's like... I'm back. I got one. OK, then. I'll take this. Um...would tomorrow be OK for the movie? Tomorrow? The theater won't be there forever. Yeah... You're busy? No, I'm fine. 2 o'clock at the theater, then? OK. You're sure? Sure. 2 o'clock? Yeah...thanks. For the ticket. Come in! OK. I'll go back and get the remote before it was broken! I went to the winter of 2030 and got it. It came out of the mud, after 99 years! Mission accomplished! I'll just slip into the role. Just like you got the cooler working. But we know her husband's name. Tamura. My mother used to come here a lot. Your mother? She went to this university, too. Maybe she's around here now. I still have the feeling I'll see him again. I wonder what he's like... I knew it reminded me of something! The more I look at it, the more it looks like me! It was yourself you hit. Wasn't it? With the baseball? You threw the ball and hit yourself! This is getting real complicated! Phweet! - Are you serious? - That's the Kappa! I copped the Kappa. Just for a pun? A bad pun. Hey, hey, hey! I copped the Kappa! Again? Hey, hey, hey! I copped the Kappa Soga-ppa! No no no no... 'I capped the Kappa Soga-ppa'! So in 25 years they still have that room... Oh, well...we'll be long gone. Now we need captions. Yeah... This one? 'Untitled'. Think of something! I can't! This one? Let's just skip that one. Not show it? It lacks something. This one's better. I dunno.... It's got a feel to it... Hey... ...can a guy change his name?
