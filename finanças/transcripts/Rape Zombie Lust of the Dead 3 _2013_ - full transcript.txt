Gensohaikyusha the sin of a woman who doesn't let a man do her is heavier than the earth. Regarding the declaration of war on us issued by North Korea... There is a public comment from the first female prime minister of Japan, hanako tsuchiya. Live: Office of prime minister hanako tsuchiya well, I am the very first female prime minister in Japan.. Now that I am in charge, I won't let men do as they please anymore. They're moving but have no biological functions, that's medically impossible. Is it possible that all men on the planet have become rapists!? If a woman is raped by a toxic man, she dies soon after. If they ejaculate inside you, it's toxic enough to kill the women! Oh, another woman is being attacked... The rapists appear to be two businessmen and a college student? There is no choice but to cut off their dicks! I knew it, we should've banned all those sick videos long ago... Freedom of expression is major crap created by men! It's all because we gave them too much freedom to create sickening sex fantasies! Stand up, rape em all, all men alive! Yes, all male self-defense officials have become toxic... So there are excessive amounts of firearms. Let them know man's strength! It's a women's world now, we must protect ourselves. All humans are descendants born from the same mitochondria... That's how evolution should be... Any comment about nuclear weapons? Satellites have captured an image of a nuclear rocket fueling in North Korea. What is the status of us interceptor missiles? It may be born already, the very first one of our next generation! Military forces have been re-organized with the remaining female soldiers. North Korea issued a declaration of war. Well then, that's all for now! I am on my way to Hawaii by chartered government jet! Sayonara! What are we gonna do? How are we gonna survive in this world? You bastard! Shit, it's Amazon! It's our territory, we won't let otaku do what they want! Many people actually saw it. Don't tell me some made up horror story. A night crawler in the class room? Give me a break. Toxic man? He looks normal. It's still alive. You are committing a security breach. I was watching you fight, you are invincible. Nothing beats Pentagon technology. I am a cyborg machine, d-1010889. More... more... give me more! Give me more pussy, let me do more! Don't be silly, you don't know how precious you are. Will you give us shinji's sperm sample? Sperm sample? What should we do with it? I'm so tired. Let's just sleep tonight. As a payback, there might be an all-out attack on Amazon. If an all-out attack is confirmed, our next big meeting will be quite heated up! I wonder if miss momoko will sing. Special audience hall we're gonna miss her vip event... Photos are permitted for the next 30 minutes. For those most honored, you're allowed to take a personal photo.. Oh, darn it! Momoko! Momoko. Momoko! Momoko! You were peeping again? You should've been more quiet if you knew I was here. You're pretty wild as usual. Don't talk to me like that. Who do you think saved you? I didn't ask for anything. Where are you going? Restroom. It'll be big trouble if anybody sees you. To women, it doesn't matter if you belong to akiba empire or not. Otaku is otaku. So creepy. Put your usual outfit on. Akemi, wake up. You must be hanako of the toilet? So, the rumor is true! You scared me! No, you scared me! You don't look like a toxic man. I hate to correct you but... Toxic man is the way to describe a sweet person by otaku. The rape monster is called dokyun. So are you otaku? I used to be, but after being ravaged by a wild school girl, not anymore. Then, I became dokyun and kanae cut off my dick and I died. I don't get it, you're alive, aren't you? I was cloned and regenerated. But she didn't mean to bring me back to life. My body was scattered all over because of the explosion. So I was revived by mistake, it's like I feel guilty being alive again. I still have no idea what you're talking about, so you're no longer otaku, right? Well, you could say that I guess. Well then let's have some fun. Please stop it, I don't like this kind of stuff. Why do women never listen, is it because you're all so stupid? Listen, you're harassing me! Shut up! Show some guts as a man! You got a dick, don't you? What the..1? You have no dick. So, when I was revived as a clone, some parts were missing. I have no dick or vagina. At least I don't rape and can't get raped, so it's kind of a relief. So in a way you are like a she-male after the operation? Okay, call me whatever you like. Hey, did it hurt when you had the operation? I won't let you kill momoko! It's a monster's baby, we must kill her! It's nozomi's baby. Either way, I will protect momoko! I promised to protect her. Shower time is 5 minutes, the next group is waiting for their turn. So, how are you hanging in here? If you have any questions, don't be shy to ask me. Yes I will. Don't waste your time, she has a husband. Oh, that's right. You are lucky, but don't brag about it. Erika doesn't have a steady now, so she's a little frustrated. Don't worry about her. Yes, thank you. Here, touch me. What's going on? Is that why you've been acting weird lately. Akemi, you are hurting me. Sayuri, how long have you been doing this behind my back? What's so funny? Behind your back? It's just play, take it easy. How dare you. Protecting citizens is your duty, isn't it? You think it's okay to steal someone's lover? You're paid from our taxes! Shit! Akemi, stop! It's my fault, I couldn't tell you I fell in love with her, I'm sorry. What are you doing? What's going on? Explain to me! Oh, such a turn-off. It's nothing. Sarg, you're also having fun with chika, huh? It's the same thing. It's a love triangle. Let me tell you, we aren't a self defense army anymore, it's just a mock uniform. You may be an elite or something but you haven't paid taxes for that long! Everything is make-believe, we're playing refugee. And self-defense army. Right, sarg? That is... But, love is not make believe! That's the best make believe of all! Love is about making babies in the first place. Women with women can't make any babies. The population in Japan was already decreasing and then this toxic men syndrome... We have no choice but annihilation. So we're all just killing time till the end. Well, sarg, I'll go back to my duty. Let's have some fun again. I don't mind a threesome. Excuse me. Maki, sabu is harmless. Sabu? He is our Guinea pig, a harmless toxic man. What? Let me go! He was in your room before, but we had him moved here. Listen, maki. Our research is to figure out what's behind love. Love? Yes, love. The problem we are facing... All normal men have lost their rational minds and became rapists... We just have to remind them about love and the rational mind. We women need to re-educate men. Like this, sabu. If men can love women like before, we are more than half way to our goal. If we could just neutralize the poison from their semen, we can all happily make love again. Besides that, we asked you to come here for your husband, shinji's sperm. Um..we haven't. What? You couldn't collect it? I guess it's difficult to collect it in the test tube. Then, let's use a condom. You can use it as usual, tie it up and bring it here. Yes. Actually... He's our rising star since he is normal and hasn't turned into a toxic man. You understand, don't you? Yes. Of course. Maki is at the doctor's office. I think she'll be back soon. You are? I am Karen. Ok, Karen. That's a nice name. Friends used to tease me, saying it doesn't suit me. It suits a school girl like you. You know I am actually still a virgin... Is that so? There's a lot that I should've done before the world became like this. Well, maybe so. To tell you the truth, I'm a really horny girl. I started masturbating when I was very young, too. I am easy to get wet, almost always. I make my panties messy, so I don't wear any most of the time. What, really? So, now? Would you like to see? See? Sorry. It's okay you're the last normal man alive, aren't you? Um..l guess so. I'm not sure why, though. Will you be my first? Huh!? Huh? What? Oh what, what!? According to the victim, Karen, she went to look for his wife maki and he suddenly attacked her. I don't understand why it happened like this. Shinji! It can't be true! Let me go see him!! Calm down, he's no longer your husband. He's just a rapist monster now! How stupid are women, huh? I bet that couple must have been sexless. That's why he didn't turn into a toxic man. Old wife, old girlfriend are just family members. No guy wants to have sex with a family member. If you did, that's just like incest, that's sick! Don't you get it, same old sex only makes a guy's dick limp. And while he was losing his sex drive for so long, he met a young pretty girl... Of course he goes crazy with a hard-on. That's exactly how men react. Who cares about love shit!? What do women know about love? Re-educate men!? Give me a break, women! We won't let women control man's concept of love or the sex drive! We remember well, the day women laughed at us... I remember well, the day I was being bullied... Sounds like they started the grand empire meeting. The class began to bully kids to please the girls in the class... So the cause of brutal bullying was women... We have come beyond sex, we have anime, games, adult video and... Got it! We know about love way better than normal guys... Who go after women for sport and sex... Look at those jocks, good looking rich guys, they end up being toxic zombies. Men with real satisfied lives turned into toxic men. God gave them true form. So as a result who's the real winner now? No need to even think, it's us, virgin otaku! If you go in now, that's suicidal. I wouldn't recommend that. You were on TV? Just some evolution studies researcher. If you're gonna risk your life, you need to think of timing. It's not the right time yet. If there are any movements, I'll let you know by this. Now, let us get revenge on our true enemy, 3D women. I have no interest in you or that maid girl. I just want to watch the evolution of the human race, I'm an evolved otaku. That's all. Let those zombies go after them... And enjoy the bloody shower! Let those three dimensional women become extinct! This is akiba empire... We are alive! Let us welcome the living goddess, miss momoko. Let them fear us by making our battle roar... Momoko!? Let us humiliate three dimensional women... Wabi! Sabi! Moe! I heard that living goddess momoko was an otaku idol when she was a business woman... So, she started singing and dancing even after the destruction of her personality... So, you're done collecting information? I gave you a lot of info, tell me what's your real task? I heard something, way before the world became like this... Unbelievable rumor on the Internet... Project herod. Project herod? That's pretty dangerous. What do you mean? Kinan it literally means to swallow a sword. In your kind of terms, a mistake or bad decision. Not that! Herod is mentioned in Matthew 2:16 to 2:18. It refers to an infant slaughter. What is that? Nozomi, you really know nothing. How could you live like that? No wonder everybody hates otaku, you think you're better than everybody, huh? Cut the crap, what is that herod thing? Three wise men came from the east. They were guided by the star, and told that the second person born in Bethlehem... Was a threat to king herod... So he ordered the killing of 12,000 infants younger than 2 years old in Bethlehem. Infant slaughter so he ordered the killing of 12,000 infants younger than 2 years old in Bethlehem. Joseph and Mary escaped so Jesus was safe, though... It is said that the actual number killed was 20 or so. That is... Was it born? Momoko! Momoko, we must escape! Momoko! You came just to kill a baby with that much technology? Self-proclaimed leader of the world, the United States... Your plan is to eliminate the roots of new evolution? If you get in my way, I'll have to eliminate you. Huh? If so, may I get to choose how to get killed? I prefer to be electrocuted instead of being roasted or chopped. Electric shock style. Don't you get it? Men... women... the human race was finished long ago! One more step. You will protect momoko, right? All men, go to hell! Kanae... Help us one more time. Hey! Raid! Bastards! Eat this! Men, go to hell! Sergeant, I am running out of ammo! Same here! Too many balls to shoot, huh? Sarg, that's a good one. Rape them all! Doctor? At this very moment? That's right. I don't want to regret not doing it later. If you use a condom, toxic men are harmless. I've proved it already. You don't say. You've done this with other Guinea pigs? I'll let you have a turn later. A man feels good... so good... I love men! I feel like doing more, it feels so good. So... this is a toxic man? This is so different from lesbian-play. Sarg, don't worry about me, go ahead! As a self-defense army officer, I must save as many people as possible! I'm cumming... cumming! Oh, why!? I knew it. That's why... That's why... I broke them. No. Shinji! You're not a toxic man, you're my husband! I don't wanna die. Shinji. I forgot how sex feels... it feels... good. In this world, there's good things, too. We're making love again. We're doing it again. We're pretty much done here, too. What's with this toxic man? Ouch!! What's with this one? Now I know why sabu didn't attack us, it wasn't because of our re-education of love. It's because he was gay. Sayuri. Akemi. Sarg. Chika. Shinji, shinji. Tell me how you feel. I am so happy that you're my husband. I am so... happy. Momoko! I won't let you hurt momoko!
