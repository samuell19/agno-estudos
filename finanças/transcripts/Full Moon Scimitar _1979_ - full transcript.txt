Oh, the Full Moon Scimitar... The full moon, the smooth scimitar the moon would become crescent the scimitar would face many challenges. The full moon, the smooth scimitar the moon knows my heart's desire. The scimitar would join two loving hearts. Tears drop as the wind laments. Success draws lovers apart. Love will soon be forgotten; the wife abandoned! The full moon, the smooth scimitar the moon comes full circle, gone is enmity and hatred. The scimitar dispels evil... The scimitar dispels evil... Excellent. You're too kind. Almost half of the great martial artists are defeated by him. Guess who he would challenge next. I hear it would be the best fighter of the Wu Dang called Liu Ruo Song. "Zhang Song Villa" Who is Ding Peng? Ding Peng. He is merely a security chief's son. No one knows where he has learnt the deadly technique called Shooting Star. He has defeated Sung Yang Swordsman, head of the Iron Sword Clan and Bao Ding Swordsman in the last 6 months. Of late I have heard that he is the most popular hero in the martial arts world. I wonder what he wants with me. It's obvious. You are the chief of Wu Dang. If he defeats you he'll top the martial arts world. He seeks to defeat me? Where is he? Xiang Si Forest. Help... What is it? Save me. She's there, get her. What are you doing? What do you think? To get our woman of course. No, please, they are robbers. They robbed me and want to rape me. Fear not, as long as I am here nobody dares touch you. Such insolence. Let's go. Who are you? You want to know who I am I too am eager to know who you are. Alright then. Take the gold hairpin to the Lee residence and you will know. Please follow me, sir. Please wait here. Do you know who I am? No. What? It's you. Yes, it's me. Please come in. Please. Why have you asked me to come here? To repay you for saving my life but I was worried you might not come that's why I did this. Please... Master Ding, if someone saves your life what would you do to thank him? What do you suggest? There is only one way. In such a case I'll give myself to him. Where's my sword manual? "Zhang Song Villa" Please. Master Ding, you really are a young hero. You flatter me. There are heroes from every clan gathered here. If you win this fight your name will rank supreme. Please show me some mercy then. I have heard your famous technique is the Shooting Star. But how come you haven't used it yet?! That's because I haven't fathomed your strength. Besides, I don't want to defeat you yet. Shooting Star... So deadly... Master Ding. Was that the Shooting Star? When have you seen it? Otherwise you couldn't have thwarted my attack. Who taught you this technique? My dad. Where's your dad? He has passed away. That's strange. Masters, hero Ding says he inherited the Shooting Star from his family. However it greatly ensembles the technique I invented, as documented in the Qing Song Sword Manual. Do you have the manual? Of course. My father stumbled onto this by chance and he gave it to me when he died but I lost it along the way. Really? Liu Fu, ask madam to take out my manual. Madam, please. What? Your wife? Dear, the manual. Thank you. Is this the technique? That's it. That's right then. Now the matter is clear. This page was lost from the manual ten years ago and we only found it recently. Master Ding's father must have stolen my manual. Later he'd have practised in secret and passed it on to his son. No, my father didn't steal it from you. She stole it from me. What are you doing? Hero Ding you must be mistaken. We haven't even met how could I have stolen from you? You... If I messed with you I would be promiscuous and you would be guilty of fornication. Right. What? What would you say... Master Ding, I thought you were a rising star. But you are merely the son of a thief. Dad, on your deathbed you asked me to glorify your name such that people would know our Ding family has a remarkable son. But I am useless. What is this place? Not bad if I could die here. Why would you want to die? Who are you? July the fifteenth is a day of the ghosts I have come from hell. What? You're a ghost? Fox ghost. Fox ghost? What place is this? This is where man and God meet. God will turn into a human here and for a mortal, the other way around. What are you laughing at? Because I have come to the right place I want to be a ghost. What? Why do you want to die at such young age? Why should I tell you? What's your name? Why do you want to know? When you die and become a ghost we might see each other often so that's why I want to know your name. So tell me your name first I am Qing Qing. Qing Qing. Qing Qing. I am Ding Peng. Alright, return the sword to me and leave. Why do you want me to go? A dying person would not look good. Why are you still looking at me? I haven't seen anyone die would you let me? What's there to look at? I know a kind of death that's interesting to watch. There is a flower called the Oblivion in here. When one eats it the person's all cares will sink into oblivion and die slowly. This is an interesting way to die. Who are you? Why do you want to kill me? Who wants to kill me? Only two people are eligible to be killed by me. Who? One is her. Is that a scimitar in your floral basket? How did you know that? So this is the scimitar I've searched it for twenty years at last I've found it. Kid, you want to die I am really... dying. No, that fellow's Deadly Palm only hit you unconscious. Grand dad has cleared your pressure points so you should be okay now. What is this place? A place where nobody would come a ghostly place. What? No human comes here this place is separated from the secular world. Anyone coming here can never return to the living world. They are not human they are like me, a fox. You seem to regret it. No, I wanted to die why would I regret? Nonetheless let him recuperate here. You are awake. This is a beautiful place, you live here? No... This place was originally my aunt's. - Who is she? - Look. "Listening to the Spring rain in a small attic all night" It's said that when my aunt was young she went to the human world with the scimitar and fell in love with a great kung fu hero. But being from different worlds they had to part. On the night they separated they sat in the rain till dawn. While parting, the young hero used his inner powers and wrote on the scimitar these characters. And hence when the aunt returned she wrote these words everywhere. Then what happened? Then she waited here hoping to see him once. She eventually died last year. The hero never came? Didn't my grand dad say so that this place is totally detached from the human world why would any person come here? One day when you are gone I don't think even you'd ever return. Would you? No, I wouldn't but I wouldn't leave here. Is it love? Or could it be termed as fate? A human and a fox shielded from the world. Every man has passions and desires. Ding Peng is a man after all. One day he would go back. No, he won't. Your parents died early and you're all I've got I can't keep you with me the rest of your life forget it, nobody knows what the future will bring. If what I guess is right it would be your destiny. Then you do endorse their marriage? In the secular world I have never seen a beautiful place like this. Thanks. You always carry it with you when you go out, why? It's a present from grand dad but he doesn't allow me to use it. Why? Because anyone who sees the scimitar drawn out is sure to die. What a deadly sword! Here, catch it. You want to practise in secret? Could I? It's mine and I'm yours so why not? This is "scimitar catching the cicada". This is the "Full Moon returning the pearl". Lethal Scimitar. This move is called "Double moon pierces the rainbow". Great technique. But, the user must be sincere because the scimitar has its own spirit. If the user has evil thoughts he'll never perfect the art. Try it and see if you have evil thoughts. This scimitar. "Listening to the Spring rain in a small attic all night" Ding Peng... I'm here. Haven't you practised enough all day? Right, Qing Qing. How has my practice been? Not bad, you're better than me. What if I returned to the human world? Then you will be invincible. What's the matter? Nothing, I feel it's a shame. Man prides himself because all along his aspirations but presently... you still ponder over Liu Ruo Song's matter. I was framed by him and the guilt wouldn't be absolved my whole life. Qing Qing, let's go to the human world. After I have had my revenge I'll return. Is revenge that important? When my father died he wanted me to glorify my ancestors this is for my late father. Qing Qing, please just help me this once. You humans have much regard for fame and glory but I fear grand dad would not allow it. We could sneak out. Who are you? What are you doing here? We're here to skin you alive. The scimitar. Did you think your petty skills could beat me? This is fox territory. Today I only kill foxes, not humans. Be on your way. Why should I leave? You're young and capable go back to the living world and you'll rank supreme. This sort of fame doesn't just come to anybody. Well? Go now if you want to go before I change my mind and kill you. If you want to kill her, kill me first. Grand dad? Yes, it's me. When you married I knew this day would come. Ding Peng is a man after all; But I had to know if he really loves you before I could let you leave with him. Here are two boxes of jewellery for your use. Thank you. Full Moon Villa? Yes, after you left home half a year ago they started building it. The master is mysterious no one has seen him. Master. The Full Moon Villa has sent an invitation for you to go and have a drink tomorrow. What's the name of the master? Ding Peng. Pardon? Ding Peng? Thank you for coming. Master Lau is here. Welcome. Master Ding, we haven't met for a while. Why have you brought the coffin? What's happening? The Full Moon Villa is meeting its neighbours today. Guess you must be at the wrong place. Absolutely not. This coffin is not necessarily for dead people. Just fill it with jewellery and treasure and you won't be carried out in it. It won't be carried out empty after all. It's a new way to rob. Where did the pine shoots come from? I have jewellery and treasure but even if I consent. The one up there wouldn't agree. Pine shoots... Who dares to ambush me? Come out if you have guts. Big brother. Let me show them what we're capable of. Attack. Your big brother didn't want this coffin removed empty; Now that someone's in it you could move it. Go. Yes... Those scumbags just now bothered you I am sorry for that. No big deal... Master Lau. There's unfinished business between us. Next month is the Lunar Mid-January Festival I'd like to invite you to my home for a chat and ascertain as to from where was the Shooting Star technique inherited. That Ding Peng? That's him. Strange, I never thought a poor kid like him could suddenly be so rich. And he hinted he'll come after you. Come after me? Why doesn't he come now and be done with it? Why build a big house in front of ours? What does he have in mind? It's hard to tell what he has in mind. How could we know what an alive human being has in mind? For someone dead it'd be different though. Right, when someone's dead he wouldn't have ideas. But it won't be easy to want him dead now. It won't be easy but not too difficult either I'd say. Do you still remember Xiao Song? You mean Song Zhong? Yes, Death by Sword Song Zhong. You are Song Zhong? Yes, I am Song Zhong, death by Sword. Why have you brought us six together? Because I have received money from six people who want you all dead I gathered you all here to save time. What a boast, I'll teach you a lesson. Tastes no good. Who are you? These two cases of gold are for you. Why? How did you get in here? The wind blew me in. What do you want? For the gold given to me I'll kill somebody. What a nerve. Who are you? Let me deal with him. Don't kill me... I won't kill you. You're already a dead man. Leave. Disaster... What is it? A coffin jumped in by itself. What? Song Zhong is dead? No, I have not died. Who said I died? Did you kill Ding Peng? Ding Peng... He is Qing Qing's husband. Qing Qing's here... Don't come near... Song Zhong, you haven't died yet. There's no Qing Qing here. Song Zhong... Miss Qing Qing, spare me please I have already died, don't kill me again. Have mercy. Song Zhong... I know... you said you'll not let me go if you saw me again. Alright, I'll go and kill myself. Right, I also want to tell you you'd better run. Qing Qing said she'll be here tomorrow and slaughter you all. Slaughter you all... Rats. Help... There are many dead rats in the kitchen. Come and look, quick. What happen? The wine has all been spoilt. It stinks... What are you doing? Someone stole our clothes. Fire... He must know about Song Zhong and has come to take revenge. Damn, of all time the thunder should come now. Is this their doing too? Nonsense, how could this be? Did you think he was a fairy? Shut up I am really frightened. Nuisance, shut up, go to sleep. What about you? I'll sit here I want to see what they could do to me. Ke Xiao... Ke Xiao... Ke Xiao... Ke Xiao. How did I get to sleep on the tree? They must have immobilized you and carried you out. Let's get out of here quickly. Let's go, quick. Ghost... Ghost... Where do you think you're going? Don't go. Let me go. You are from hell you want to take my life. Ke Xiao... Ke Xiao... Even couples in times of danger, go separate ways. Who? Who are you? I am a beautiful woman. I am behind you. Where? Where are you? Aren't you afraid you might be mesmerised by me? Alright, I'll appear to you. Am I beautiful? Have you seen enough? You are... I am here to save you. In this world I am the only one who could deal with Qing Qing. But she is a ghost. So am I. What? You are a ghost too? Right, only a human could deal with a human and a ghost with a ghost. Would you like to see how I'll deal with Qing Qing? What? Follow me. What is this place? A dilapidated hall where fox ghosts gather. What? Fox ghost? She's coming, hide behind and don't come out. Qing Qing... You have the guts to come here. I didn't think you'd come here either. Of course, I want to kill you. Stop talking and grab your sword. Sister you still remember what happened a thousand years ago? Naturally. If you hadn't stolen my potion I would have achieved spiritual progress 500 years ago would I have to wait till now? So they had a grudge because of the potion. Your kung fu is really good. You now understand why I saved you. My only enemy is Qing Qing precisely because she wants to kill you I have saved you. Two days after when I fight with Ding Peng. Could you help me again? Of course. "Full Moon Villa" If I remember correctly today will determine which of us wins. Lunar Mid-January Festival. Right. This duel will be judged by masters of the martial arts world I invited. You seem confident. This is... This is my new wife. Would you be using the Shooting Star technique you stole as before or have you stolen other techniques? I am not using the sword this time but the scimitar. Fear not use the techniques I taught you yesterday to attack him I'll help you from behind. Brother Lau, your kung fu has improved a lot your swordsmanship is deadly. You're too kind... What next? Challenge him officially, limited to ten moves. Opponent drops his weapons and have his clothes damaged. The loser has to admit as a bastard and loses his whole residence. Right. If he loses everything is finished. Right, I hereby challenge Ding Peng to a duel officially in front of all senior masters. Ten exchanges are the basis of the duel the opponent must drop his weapons and have his clothes damaged. The loser, for whole life must admit he's a bastard and loses the whole residence. Are you really that confident? I wouldn't have come otherwise. Alright, let all be witness then and see who is the bastard. First move second exchange third exchange fourth exchange. Lan Lan, why haven't you used magic to help me yet. I've to see his moves before I deal a deadly blow. Go quickly. The fifth exchange. He's lost his clothes. That was the sixth exchange. The seventh exchange. The next is the eighth and your sword would be gone. Two more moves, would you need your wife to help you. Lan Lan, what are you waiting for? What are you up to? You are mad again, he is mad again I was a prostitute with Moon Heung Yuen. He looked me up suddenly one day and wanted me to be his wife in fact at that time he was a cuckold. Then he wanted me to dress up as a heroine and come here to see him fight. He said he'll kill master Ding in three moves. Don't you think he's nuts? Don't move I thought Ron Song is a great swordsman he is in fact a mad man. So you... What about us? Two years ago I was also defeated by this trick. The ninth and tenth moves. You've good manners indeed! You've lost and still got to kneel to me. Lan Lan, you... I suppose you want to know what this is all about I tell you frankly. This is a trap by Ding Peng and Qing Qing she paid me to set you up in your home then to put on a show at the dilapidated temple. You fell for it and embarrassed yourself here. Your pupil at your service. What? You regard me as your teacher? No. You can't take him as your pupil. Why not? It is out of his good intention. Just think. The greatest swordsman the leader of Wu Dang is my student I am so proud. You once said when you left you came back to avenge your shame and take back your glory. You also said the world is cold and you wanted to return. No, Qing Qing I only saw one side of the human world. There are indeed good people in the world. Look, these people here today are not bad. They are totally different from what I was. As long as I love you it doesn't matter where we are. This is a glamorous place and is packed with people they live like kings. Everything is better than living in the mountains. He is a regular here. The son of Loong Moon's chief. He just returned from the border. Loong Moon clan is the greatest in the martial world. This place has been booked for the night. Right? Yes... no... Yes or no, speak. What difference will it make? You have to go anyway. Why? Because the girl Tsui Hung is mine. As long as I am here I don't want to see anyone. Teacher, stop, you can't hurt him. Why? Haven't you seen the iron medal he is carrying? This is an icon of immunity given by the sixteen clans. His father has done great deeds in the martial arts world. If the owner of the badge is harmed he will be the enemy of the sixteen clans and would surely die within 7 days. Says who? The third master of the Mighty Sword Villa. He is the master of all. I heard this long before I returned. You have risen quickly in the martial arts world but then your efforts would be useless because everyone acknowledge third master is the best. What do you want? I want to kill you because you dare not kill me. Tell third master I'll look for him in 7 days. He is known as a saint and they say he is No.1 in the martial arts world why do you look for him? Precisely because he is the best. Why? Because I deem I should be the best. You have changed. Don't you think you are too arrogant? No. With kung fu like mine they say I should be the leader of all with my current status they say I should rule the martial arts world. But then I haven't done this am I not humble enough? Why do you still look for third master? Because being in the martial arts world I have to know if he or I am the best. Is it worth it? Is it worth going this way for empty fame? And... You are a nuisance. Do you know how important fame is to human beings not being one yourself? You are not human so you'll never understand. Do you appreciate how I feel about getting everything I want. They have to listen to me and agree with me on everything. Just think; With me like this could I accommodate someone as 3rd master in my world? Immunity badge my ass. As long as I have the scimitar see who could defeat me. Teacher. Yonder shore is the Mighty Sword Villa? Right. That's where you'll be crowned the best of the best. What are those people gathered on the shore looking at? They are here to look at you and pay respects besides, with your status today dare they not come? Really? Who is she? She is daughter of the wealthiest family of Nan Gong her name is Nan Gong Fen Yan. She has come out of admiration for you. This is a toast from our lady wishing you every success and to achieve great fame. Thank you. If I return triumphant I will notify you straight away. Thank you. With your level of kung fu you should be invincible I'll await you here with a feast. Thank you. See you later. "House of Swords" This is a place for my master's practice please have tea outside I am not a guest I am here to fight with your master. My master would not fight with anyone anymore. Is this coming from you or your master. From me naturally. You are not the master and what you say is not valid. If it does not count and as such it is rubbish. Step down. Who are you? Ding Peng. So you are the famous Ding Peng causing all the current noise. You flatter me. Right, what are your names? Here only the master and squire have names, others don't. This place is for storing swords not duels. Then why are you clasping swords in your hands. They are not swords. Man is the sword. We're called Sword's Slaves. Sword's Slave? Our duty is to keep out intruders. Please leave at once. What if I don't? Then you'll be forced out. This Eighteenth formation is not bad but wait till you see the power of the scimitar. Rainbow Scimitar. Thank you. You live up to your fame. Please come in. Of all martial artists you are the only one who could thwart the formation. Really? Thank you. When they use the swords they apply their hearts, not hands. You are ambitious and your sword follows your heart's desire. Using one's heart is the highest form of martial arts. Please sit. Sorry, there are only two cushions here. Do you know why I invited you in? Why? I want to ask you if your scimitar has 7 characters on it? Listening to Spring rain in a small attic all night. How did you know that? Actually I need not ask there's only one scimitar in the world. You've seen it? This is not our issue today. Right, you want to have a duel with me but I have not held a sword in 20 years. Besides, the sword at the Mighty Sword Villa is at the bottom of the lake after the duel with Yin. Yes, but the name of the Mighty Sword Villa sill exists that's why I've come here. How old are you? Twenty three. You're very young and as yet still place too much importance on fame. What will you do if you defeat me? What if I lose? The best fighter in the martial arts world may not be the best fighter in the world because many have departed. Your skills have attained the highest level but you are still human and so you pursue fame and are a slave of the sword. Have you ever thought what you'd become if you were without the scimitar? Well? You'll have nothing you'll be reduced to being a commoner like the ones who brought you here. But you said just now the sword might have been lost but my name still exists that is to say though I am without a sword the sword's spirit is in me I have attained the highest level. A sword is not a sword, and I am not what I am. Young man, I have no sword to fight with you nor do I have the reason. It'll be up to you advise them if you have won or not in any case no one knows what's happened here. But real victory and defeat lies inside you not by what you say. Teacher, what is the result? I have won. Thank you. Please. Master Ding, sorry you had to see me home. It's alright. The night is damp and robbers abound. It's best I saw you home. Help... save me. What's the matter? Someone over there killed all six of my brothers and he's coming this way. You killed these six people? Yes, we live by killing and robbing and we met earlier at Full Moon Villa. Kill. Run... quickly. Don't run... Miss Nan Gong you are all alone now. What? You haven't died? Not only that, but my brothers have not died. This is a trap set by our brother. You... Our aim is to abduct Miss Nan Gong and ask your dad for a ransom. You underestimated me. When you were dying I held your hand and felt your pulse beating. So I knew it was a set-up. Kill... Let me toast you for saving my daughter's life. Thank you, please. Please I heard you defeated third master at the Mighty Sword Villa. It seems that the best of the best should be your title now. You're right. Master Ding is really a young hero. Master... About the favour I asked of you... I know. Master Ding you are now the best martial artist in the martial arts world. In terms of power none equals the Nan Gong family. If your two families could be united by marriage it would be a grand event. You mean to say... I am the go-between representing Nan Gong. Master Ding, I have only one daughter and we owe you her life. If you are willing to accept her I pledge everything of 108 sub-clans in 18 provinces and those of the 36 societies as her dowry. You would not only be the best by then but you could become the king of the martial arts world. But I... Teacher... Don't let this opportunity go. One's aim in life is either fame or money. Now you can have both after you marry her you could immediately be the leader of martial world and become king. Besides, she's a beauty. But what about Qing Qing... Qing Qing, I still love you but I am only human and you're a fox. Just think I would be a leader and by then if people knew my wife is a fox spirit I could be embarrassed. When we first met you knew I am not human. Yes, but then I did not have this position I know you love me. Would you have me embarrassed in front of everyone? Why don't you move back to the mountain first and I'll look you up when I have time. Why do I have to move back to the mountains? Because you need this place to get married with that Nan Gong lady. You love her a lot? No, I still love you but she has a family which could support me as leader of the martial arts world and she could be presented to the world however if you don't like it you could stay I'll build her another house. No, I'll go. Ding Peng, you'll die soon. Lau Fu... When will my teacher the Invincible Eagle arrive? I hear the best fighters of the 16 schools have arrived at the lake side. In about 3 days they'll be at that place. Mr Suen, because Ding Peng has injured you the sixteen schools are offended. They are all after Ding Peng now. You could have your revenge soon of cutting off your arm soon. Invincible Eagle, my respects. Greetings. Have all the schools arrived? Yes. Good. Let's go and get Ding Peng now. Listening to the Spring rain in a small attic all night. Who are you? You are... I live here. Who wrote these characters? Why do you ask? I once wrote them on a scimitar. So you are that young hero. Unfortunately you are late my aunt died a few years ago. Old friends have departed, an empty house remains. Bid farewell on a rainy night. Old sorrows flow endlessly as the river. My sadness is like the clouds. You attend the former reunion now. The place is still pretty but who will appreciate it! May I ask... Aunt and me are both lovelorn I felt strange that the scimitar should end up in Ding Peng's hands. He is the father of the child? Not anymore. He is the new star of the martial arts world son-in-law of the Nan Gong family. Quick... the guests are here. As per Ron Song the sixteen schools are on their way they might be coming to congratulate me that's why we need a good place to entertain our guests. Yes. I little expect our family would have such a distinguished son-in-law. Master, someone outside wants to see you. Why have you come here? I came to tell you Qing Qing raised a son for you and is waiting in the hills for you. When did third master start meddling with these petty matters? A hero should never be an ungrateful person I fear you will regret it one day. You dare speak nonsense here. Who do you think you are? Do you really want to have a taste of the deadly scimitar? There must be a reason for a sword to become invincible. With people like you even the most treasured sword shall become like scrap iron. Bring the best sword to third master. Yes. What for? I don't want to kill an unarmed man. Please. Thanks, no need. Evil cannot win over good, that's the law of nature even with thousands of swords you can't defeat my righteous spirit. Bull shit. Ding Peng, are you mad? What if I am? Wait, I've come here to speak a few words with Ding Peng. That's none of your business. You needn't fight I am taking this scimitar away because you are unworthy of it. Simply nuts. With the skill I have do I care for that scimitar? Master, the sixteen schools are all here. Straighten my clothes. We are honoured by your presence. Welcome I wonder what I could do for you all? You are mistaken, they're here to avenge the damage done to my immunity badge. Injuring me infers challenging the whole martial world. The Invincible Eagle has come to adjudicate the case. What do you want then? I want to see how good you are. Father-in-law, please send the men from all the divisions to deal with them. Master Nan Gong for our old friendship's sake I will not pursue this matter with you if you are smart you'd better leave. Or else you'll taste the deadly onslaught of the sixteen schools and me. Father-in-law you can't leave. Dad, you must save him, I love him. That's your lookout but it's my life that's at stake. Let go. Father-in-law... Dad... Go and save yourself first. Father-in-law, Fen Yan Ron Song, please gather all your friends here to avenge for your teacher. My teacher? He's here I tell you frankly I have arranged for the sixteen schools to seek revenge today. Why? To take revenge on you. Wait. To kill his kind would be to smear dirt on one's sword. Get out if you want to live. Teacher, why don't you kill him? Because I have use for him. Qing Qing where are you? Qing Qing... Qing Qing. Qing Qing... As I expected the Evil Clan still exists. Black Evil Clan? 20 years ago righteous heroes tried to kill evil in the Black Evil Lake but they escaped we haven't heard of them since. The others thought they were all dead only I tracked them down I then heard my pupil say Ding Peng had an invincible scimitar which led me to think 20 years ago I too was injured by a scimitar of the Evil clan's Tung Fang Bu Bai which was also invincible. So I let you escape in the hope you would find them. So you're not a fox I belong to the evil clan but I pretended to be a fox to escape killing. You admit it. Get his sword. Run. Chase. Where's your grand dad? They left long ago. Get the old rogue and settle our score. You're late unfortunately. My grand dad left six months ago. Don't worry. "Let justice rule" What I've owed people, I'll surely return it in person. Invincible Eagle 20 years ago when we fought both our only child died. We should be even. Could you still be chasing me for 20 years for a scar on your face? You are a plague to the martial arts world. Every righteous hero ought to rid you off. You put it in a nice way. It's actually you who is after fame. Qing Qing, Invincible Eagle when I became a leader I have since become good and have not done anything bad. Besides I have been a hermit for the last 20 years. Could I be a plague to others? You are still the Black Evil Clan. Teacher, take care. Give me the baby. Everyone, stop I'll kill the baby if whoever moves. Drop your weapons I forgot to say one thing. If you all die he would still die because we must ensure we get rid of him. Stop, are you a human being? No, he isn't he is a beast in disguise. Who are you? Where are you? Third master? Commoners focus on hatred and neglect love why can't you let your hatred go and live in peace? The Black Evil Clan kill people for no reason there'll be no peace as long as they still exist. You must be wrong they have been living as hermits for 20 years and have never used any weapons. And to kill them you have already killed many wrong people in the last 20 years. You are in fact the cold blooded murderer. Besides, your pupil is treacherous and wants to kill even this baby he is in fact the scum bag. So it seems we should discern who are the really evil ones. Xie Xiao Feng, who are you to lecture me I only want to ask you to live and let live and turn your quarrels into peace. Ask my sword first. Liu Ruo Song. Time to settle our score. Teacher, I am your pupil how would I dare to fight with you. Ding Peng. Qing Qing, are you alright? Yes. The ones who killed many people in the martial world are those scumbags and hypocrites like him. Guess it's the inborn nature of everyone. One often does all sorts of things for glory. Only some manage to conceal it and some don't.
