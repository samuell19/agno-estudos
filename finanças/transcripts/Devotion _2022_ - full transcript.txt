[wind whistling] [engine whirring] [engine starts] -[drill instructor] Move! -[soldier] Thank you, sir. [mechanic 1] It could be tough to replace. [mechanic 2] Yeah, go and jet the vent tube. [sighs] [soldier, muffled] You ain't worth shit. Yeah, I'm talking to you. You better run. I said run! [locker slams] Everything okay over there? You the transfer? Lieutenant Tom Hudner. Jesse Brown. It's good to meet you. Where'd you come in from? Pearl Harbor. Flying Bearcats? Skyraiders. Lot of profile flights. Tracking torpedoes. Post-war busywork. You, uh... You fly in The Big Show? I did not. Then you'll fit right in. -[door opens] -[soldier] What are you talking about? -You should be grateful your room has seen action. -Morning, Jesse. Good morning, Jess. You're the one with clean sheets. Hey! You must be the new guy. Marty Goode, with an "E." You mean "G"? "E" at the end. Oh, Jesus! Don't tell me you're one of these country boys. [soldier 2] All right, Marty. Watch yourself. Bo Lavery. And this is Jerry, or Kraut, Fritz, Heine. -They all work. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you. And regardless of what you hear, the name's Carol Mohring. Pleasure to meet you. [soldier 3] Now, there's a sight. Good to see you, Bill. Good to see you. Gents, this is Tom Hudner. We were in Pensacola together. Hell of a stick. Hell of a pretty face, too. Almost too pretty. You boys sound lonely. [all chuckle] Welcome to VF-32. [muffled explosion] [news presenter] Will the atom shatter a world to fragments, or will it be a boon to mankind? Stalin and the Soviets field-tested their own bomb, and wouldn't you know it, it's the same design as ours. I'd say that they're hot on our heels, but this footage is already six months old. It won't be long before they strap that thing to a bomber. Bo, get that for me, would you? So, now you know. Fellas, you're not just here to fly and screw. 'Cause they're not sitting idle. But with practice, there is not a pilot on this planet who can wipe the ass of a United States naval aviator and I truly believe that. -[pilot] That's right! -[whooping] [commander] So, nav hops... Koenig, you got Mohring. Lavery, you got Goode. -Ensign Brown! -Sir. You've got Lieutenant Hudner today. Yes, sir. Have fun. [commander] Matt, you take Calloway. [chuckles] All right, maps out, lights on, let's go. -[Bo] See if you can keep up. -[Marty] Let's go. -[Bo] Whoo-hoo! -[Carol] All right, Bill. You ready? 'Cause if you bring that girl around, you're gonna have a problem. [Bill] Shit. She'll be sitting in my lap. What are you talking about? That's all I'm saying. Pretty warm out for a wool cap. It's part of my kit. Never know when you'll need it. [soldier on PA] ...personnel, stand clear. I'll try to keep us short of Canada, Lieutenant. [whirring] [Jesse on radio] Watch your prop. Try not to cut off my wing. [engines roaring] We're taking a slight detour on the way home. -Try to keep up. -Say again? [engine whirs] [exhales] [engines roaring] [breathes heavily] [gasps] [Tom on radio] What the hell are you doing, Ensign Brown? [sighs] [watch ticks] You still with me? [breathes heavily] Up and hard on my call. [engines roaring] Ready, set, hit it! [inhales] [grunts] Any detours you wanna make? -[chattering] -[jazz playing on radio] Pretty slick flying for a nav hop. Helps to know the plane. Can't learn everything from a book. [metal clanks] Or at the Academy. Well, there's knowing the plane and then there's flat-hatting. What are you gonna find out about your wingman cruising at 10,000 feet, Lieutenant? Put him in a little bit of trouble, who knows, you might get a peek at who he really is. How 'bout I buy you a beer? Plenty to talk about between who I am and not getting each other killed on nav hops. Sounds nice, Lieutenant, but I don't drink. Did you get to see the lighthouse? I did.

[pilot] Give me one of them napkins. [Bo] So, the Gulfstream's all right. Tends to be a little busy. Lot of locals, but a lot of college girls who like to go out on school nights. Sadao's is good on Thursdays. Dimber's is the move to make on Saturdays and Sundays, if you don't mind the cover. Just think of that as an investment though. Trust me. But, I gotta warn ya, no matter where you go, it is rough these days. All right, girls around here do not go for participation medals. Despite what they say, they are looking for that war tin. That hero tin. And here, that's only Cevoli. Got a Navy Cross and he's got a wife. Might be connected. Wait, you ain't married, are you? No. I'll start with the Navy, figure out the rest later. Smart man. How'd you come in? Applied to the Academy right after Pearl Harbor. I wanted to help. As we all did. But yeah, show up to find the heroes are made, the fleets mothballed. Mm-hmm. War ended a month before I graduated. You know, I suppose we were born a few years too late. Or too early. The whole world's looking different. Hell, did you ever think that you'd be in a squadron with a colored aviator? [clears throat] Well, I didn't come here to not eat. Cheers to that. [grunts] All right. How are the clams?

[soldier on PA] All yellow shirts on FOD walk down. Morning, boys! Seems one of our reconnaissance planes went down over the Baltic a few days ago. Now, what you won't see here in the newspaper is the photos the Pentagon has of Navy flight uniforms washed up on the shore and the landing gear, which is absolutely riddled with bullets. That is more than a quiet act of aggression. Washington wants us ready to respond to the Russians and, uh, this is what we're gonna get ready with. [Bill] Say hello to the F4U Corsair. Flew the hog a little after the war. But the Navy's gone and made 'em fatter and meaner. Now, I know that the Corsair will be new for a lot of you, but don't worry. Just like yours truly, she earned her stripes in The Big Show. Now, this is a plane that will get your hands dirty. You're gonna be so close to the action, you're gonna start to think that you made the mistake of joining the Army. And I gotta mention, she's got a rather unfortunate nickname. "The Widow-maker." Good thing I ain't hitched. Well, they also call her the "Ensign Eliminator." This engine's one of the most powerful things you'll ever fly behind. You throttle her too hard, she'll spin you over. She's got enough torque to flip a house, so go easy on the power. CAG wants us up to speed and fast. So, manuals are getting dropped off in the ready room. Any other questions, God help ya, take 'em up with the good Professor Koenig here. All right. -[Tom] Oh, she looks pretty mean, huh? -[Marty] The "Widow-maker." [Bo] Oh! She is a beaut! -[Carol] Hey, Professor K? -[Bo] She's awful purdy. [pilot] Now, Bo, you don't know what you're doing with this thing. [grunts] [engine hisses] Need a lift? Guys said you had family nearby? Across the bay in Fall River. They must be happy, having you back. I think they'd be happier if I were coming back to work for the family. Supposed to take over my old man's grocery stores. [smacks lips] But I was called to adventure. What about you? What brought you here? Always wanted to fly. Wanted to fly where the best pilots flew. That'd be the Navy. -[Jesse] Thanks for the lift. -[Tom] Of course. Ma'am. Tom Hudner. Daisy. Can I get you something to drink? I'm sure Lieutenant Hudner has plans. Better be getting back, ma'am. Beautiful house, by the way. Nice to see it from the ground. Thank you. Play nice. What? Play nice. I don't know about him yet. [Daisy] Where's our car? Where's our baby? Sleeping. Car's on the side of the road. Abandoned. [Daisy sighs] Okay. [Jesse] Tires are probably gone. [Daisy chuckles] [pilot] Hey, airmen! My tail fin could use some air. [soldier on PA] Stand by for check time. Stand by for check time. [Bo] Hey, Lieutenant! I think she likes me. Famous last words. She's not gonna bite. [Carol] You know what's not in the manual? How big this damn nose is. How the hell are you supposed to land on a carrier if you can't see it? Not everything's in the same place, Carol, but everything's the same. Just in different places. Hey. You know I crashed a Bearcat when I was learning to fly it? You know, you better not let Goode hear you say that. Too late. [metal creaks] [metal creaks] [narrator on radio] Many outstanding fighter pilot achievements may seem almost unbelievable. [engines roaring] But once you have learned how they accomplished these victories, and the system they used, you'll realize it's just a trick of the trade carried out by fighting men with the ability and know-how that it takes to win aerial battles. The keynote of fighter tactics in the United States Navy today is teamwork. [engines roaring] Teamwork, coordination, cooperation, call it what you will, gives the fighter its greatest value in escorting bombers and torpedo planes on their missions. In enabling fighters to protect other fighters, in winning engagements that may mean the losing or the saving of a carrier. You have to fight them with your head, using your judgment, your skill in plane-handling, and your superior gunnery to turn the odds in your favor. It's a matter of life insurance to make every split-second count. [gunfire] [commander] Attention on deck. As you were, gentlemen. As you were. I'm Captain Thomas Sisson, and I command the USS Leyte. Now, we have learned that the Soviets are jockeying for a warm water port in the Mediterranean. Now, they think they can bully their way into Europe and spook our new NATO allies. Well, DC thinks it's best if we prevent them from doing so. And we are crewing up to keep the Cold War from turning hot, and Cevoli here tells me this is the best place to do so. We ship out next week. Look forward to having you onboard. All right, all right. You remember when I told you to get up to speed, and fast? I meant speedier and faster. Carrier quals are at the end of the week. You can't land a Corsair on the Leyte, uh, you get yourself a nice dry-land job in Topeka or some place even shittier, God help you. Either way, start settling up your bar tab, boys. We are leaving Rhode Island. [pilot] Ah, here it comes. Just because I'm going doesn't mean I'm fighting, Daisy. [sighs] That's the deal, darling. Remember? We knew this day might come. And yet it doesn't make it any easier. But we'll be okay. Mad... [chuckles] ...but okay. Okay. [sighs] Jesse, what's going on? Honestly... My mind's on landing that Corsair tomorrow. You never met a plane you couldn't land, Jesse. This plane will be the death of me. I can't see like I can out of a Bearcat. Fogs my instincts. Your instincts... are one of the few things in this world that I trust. And if you can't trust that plane, you gotta put it in whatever will get you down safe. Yes, ma'am. -[Marty] You ready, Carol? -[Carol] Try and keep up, Marty. [Bo] Bottom of the board buys drinks tonight, boys. [Marty] I hope you brought cash. [Bo] Won't need it, we'll be spending yours. [door opens] [door closes] [breathes deeply] You ain't shit. [exhales] You ain't never landing that plane, nigger. Boy. Your monkey-ass shouldn't even be flying. [grunts] [breathes heavily] [grunts] [sniffles] [sniffles, breathes heavily] [officer on PA] Flight ops commence, flight ops commence. Be aware of all prop wash. All hands on deck. [sailor] Don't need all hands. [sailor 2] Doing it! [officer on PA] All repair parties, man your stations. All repair parties, man your stations. [crew shouting, chattering] [engine roaring] -[Dick] That's Hudner. -[Carol] Mm-hmm. [officer on radio] You're on a good approach, Hudner. Just keep an eye on the LSO. [grunts] All right, pretty boy. [cable wobbles] All right, three-to-one he misses it. I'll take the action. Bonus if he splashes? [chuckles] Christ, Bo, we don't want him dead. [landing gear whirs] Looks like they wanna see Jackie Robinson steal home. [officer on radio] Ensign Brown, you're too high. That's a shit approach. Come on. Get your nose up. Why isn't he listening to the LSO? [grunts] [engine roars] [all shout] Geez! [all shout] [grunts] [officer on radio] That was pretty close, Brown. Do you wanna call it? I'm coming back around. [officer on PA] Crash crew, stand by. [breathes heavily] [officer on radio] You're still too high, Brown. You're not in the groove. I'll get there. [grunts] [engine roars] [cable wobbles] [exhales] [all cheer] All right, Jesse. [sailor] Attaboy! [officer on PA] Attention, all hands. Flight operations commence in one hour. FOD walk in 15 mikes. All available hands on deck. FOD walk in 15 mikes. Doesn't matter how you did it. Just matters that you got down, pal. [Dick] Fellas, you all passed your carrier quals. [all cheer] [pilot] That's what I'm talking about. Top marks go to... Yeah. Lieutenant Hudner with the only perfect grade. Oh, bastard. Which brings us to Ensign Brown. D-N-K-U-A! [all] Damn near killed us all. [Dick] Enjoy tonight, boys. We ship out in the morning. And now is the time, if you haven't already, get all your affairs in order. All right. [pilot] What affairs do you have to get in order, my friend? [pilot 2] I'm headed to Denver, boys. That was some landing. [pilot 3] I'm never too drunk to drive. Just trying to keep it interesting. You get your car fixed yet? You heading to the bar with the guys? I don't think so. [clears throat] Wanna come in? [engine stops] Hey, Daisy? Yes? [door closes] What did I tell you? Yes, ma'am. [child] Mommy? Oh. Let me get her. Okay. Nice to see you again. You as well. [mumbles] Which one do you like? The blue one? The gray one? The gray one. You had a good day? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Uh-huh. What'd you do? You don't remember? Here you are. Thought Jesse didn't drink. He doesn't. [chuckles] Your husband's quite the aviator. Well, he must feel the same way about you. Because you and Carol Mohring are the only boys from Fighting 32 that he has ever invited over. It's good to know the men you're flying with. See what they're fighting for. I like that. And what about you, Tom? What are you fighting for? God, country and honor aside. You know, Mrs. Brown, I'm... hoping to find that out. [Jesse laughs] Come on. -Come on. -[child] Okay. Don't be fooled by his strong, silent act, by the way. He trusts you, I swear, he's the funniest man you'll ever know. I can't say he's shown me that side yet. Mm-hmm. Something to look forward to. [chuckles] Well, you're about to spend a lot of time together. Lot of time in very small spaces. May I ask you a favor? Of course. Second he steps on that ship and into that plane, I can't protect him anymore. So I need you to be there for my Jesse. Okay? Okay. Okay. [Jesse] Good? -[child] Hmm. -[Jesse] That was good, yeah? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. [Daisy chuckles] Who is this? This is Pam. Hi, Pam. [mimics airplane] I don't think she wants to embarrass you, Lieutenant. [Daisy chuckles] It's too late. Come on. She might hold the stick better than you. Okay. [chuckles] Well, I know it's our last night here, so I'll let you all enjoy it together. Thank you again for the drink. You're very welcome. I'll walk ya out. Just be careful. Worst thing that can happen to me is a bad sunburn. You come back as black as you like, as long as you come home. 'Cause you're taking me to The Bahamas when you get back. Bahamas? If I get some shore time, I'll get you one of those European swimsuits. One of those two-piece things. Tootie... you know you can always come back here and wave to me. I'm only 5,000 miles that way. [chuckles] I'll wave back. Mm-hmm. The only person I ever met belonged in the sky. Just remember you belong down here with us, too, okay? [sighs] I'll write you every week. Mm-hmm. I know you will. [sighs] [all panting] [sailor] Break those chains down. [officer on PA] Secure from General Quarters. All hands! Secure from General Quarters. Maybe you'd be faster if we did this in the middle of the night. What you don't seem to understand is that someday soon, this is gonna be real. And you have to do a hell of a lot better than that! [all] Yes, sir. All right. [sailor] I gotta run him down to 2-A. I am getting tired of getting ready. Tired of living in this floating sardine can. Tired of you smelling like one. That's what men smell like. Something to look forward to one day, Fritz. Most excitement we've seen in days. [Captain Sisson] Ensign Brown. Could I speak to you for a moment? Careful what you wish for. [sailor] I'll go ahead and respot it. Aye, sir. Huh. [camera pops] Do we have to do this above deck? Oh, yeah. It's great having you right in front of your plane. Relax. You look great. [Tom] What's going on? [Dick] Life magazine is here. I guess the Pentagon wanted something positive for the folks back home. Help 'em swallow the pill of another potential war. What better way than, "Black man makes good?" He does makes a nice trophy boy. You ought to be proud, Skip. Shut up, Bo. [journalist] Your commanding officer called you one of the best pilots he's ever seen, regardless of color. [officer on PA] Flight checks and FOD walks for fixed-wing and rotary aircraft must be documented. That's kind of him to say, but I can't say I'm special. Well, it must be hard, right? It must be hard being the only-- A naval aviator? Absolutely. Landing planes on carriers, it's the-- it's the toughest job there is for anyone wearing wings. [officer on PA] Heavy maintenance visit will be performed in all aircraft... Come on, Ensign Brown. You know what I mean. Jesse's fine. Okay, Jesse. There's a lot of guys from different backgrounds, but there's only one you. There's only one you, too, sir. [chuckles] Look, I mean no disrespect, but I don't think I'm gonna say what you're looking for me to say. All right. I worked hard to fly these planes. It's all I've ever wanted to do. Harder than I can put into words. [Dick] Jesse. Can we get a few more pictures of Jesse in his plane? I gotta get my pilots back to work. It'll just take a minute, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Commander. Have a nice day. [sailor] Watch your back! Damn, Jesse. You just put a letter in the mail. One a week. That's what I told her. [Carol] It's no use trying to slow him down. [chattering] Hey, we caught your little circus act up on deck. [chuckling] Your boy juggle, too? Or... [shoes tap] [laughs] [scoffs] [laughs] Guess not. [marine scoffs] Well. Nice. We should have stood up to that asshole. [Jesse] I'm good, Tom. Look, I'm just saying we shouldn't be letting him run his mouth like that. [Carol sighs] [Dick] Now, I know that you're all sick of doing busywork, but, oh, have I got a chore for a lucky someone. Not it. Maintenance has replaced a gyro on one of the Corsairs, I need a volunteer to make sure all is working. It's just a quick up and down. I thought you said "lucky." It sounds like a hoot. Why don't we give it to Fritz? He could use the landing. [all chuckling] I'll do it. [Dick] All right. Actually, if you don't mind, Lieutenant, Lavery's right for once. 'Course I'm right. I could use the trap. All yours. Heil Herr Mohring! [Dick] Mohring it is. [Marty] All right. All right, now as for the rest of you, command has ordered an audit on serial numbers on parts across all of the planes. So while Mohring is up there enjoying the sightseeing, the rest of you can validate all of the serial numbers on every single one of these maintenance orders. [all groaning] Thank you, Matthew. Yeah. [Bo] Uh, sir? That'll take all day. Only if you work quick. [flight officer] Ensign Mohring, you are clear to test the gyro. 2-17 to tower. Gyro seems to be in working order. [flight officer] Copy that. Return to carrier. Ensign Mohring, your approach is shallow. I'm correcting. Manufacture number? "P-5-5-1-8-4." What is it? [breathing heavily] [Jesse] Not gonna make the deck. [Tom] He'll make it. Just gotta slowly pour on the power. On this approach? Better to wave off. Try again. [flight officer on PA] Crash crew, stand by. Crash crew, stand by. [crew 3] Man your station. Out of the way. Coming in. [inhales sharply] [flight officer on radio] You're still low, Mohring. [crew chattering] Go around, pal. Ease it on, Mohring. [flight officer] Ensign Mohring, give me some altitude. [grunts] No, no, no, no, no! [crashes] [grunts] [crew 5] He's in the water. [crew 6] Man overboard! [crew 7] Get your vest pack! [crew 8] We need rescue! Poured on the power too damn fast. [alarm blaring] [crash crew shouting] [crew] Let's go, let's go! [crew 8] Do we pull him out? [alarm continues] Some people are gonna tell you that this is what you signed up for. It's not. Let's be real clear. We lost a friend. And that is not easy. Now, the Navy's gonna do what the Navy does. But, um... I'll write his family. Send them his things. [sighs] The guys are getting together. Just because you think you know better doesn't mean you have to say anything. What are you talking about? [sniffles] Carol hadn't been in the water five seconds before you were talking about what he could've done better. We all make mistakes. That could've been me, that-- Don't let that ring convince you otherwise. What's the one thing they told us about the Corsair? Remind me. What'd they tell us about the Corsair? You can't punch the throttle. Mistakes get us killed, Jesse. You don't die if you do what you're told. [Marty] Fellas. You coming? To Carol. [Tom] We're not even at war, and we're losing men. Good men. It's just a tough pill to swallow when there's nothing to blame. The swim test in flight school... They made me do it ten times. Didn't believe that a nigger could swim. They dumped ice in the water. Put weights in my flight suit. Held me under. They wouldn't have cared if I died in that pool. But every time... I made it out. Got used to flying the Bearcat. [chuckles] See everything. The deck on approach. [sniffles] All right in front of me. I could land it on my front yard if I had to. But the Corsair... I can't see anything. You have to rely on the LSO. [Jesse] Hard to believe that the LSO won't crash my Black ass on purpose. I can't tell you how many times people have told me to give up, quit. Die, even. That's why you can't always do what you're told. If I did, I wouldn't be here. [sighs] That's something I was trying to teach Mohring. [sniffles] [Dick] You guys are tired. I see it. Hell, I am, too. Been a rough few weeks. Fortunately, we are docking in Cannes for a little shore leave. Now, I don't know about you, but I think some fresh air would do all of us some good. [pilot whistles] Obviously, ship rules follow you ashore. Liberty expires at 2300. [chuckles] You are foreigners in a foreign city, and you look the part. So please, Marty, please, dear God, don't do anything stupid. Mm-hmm. Oh, and, uh, no, I don't wanna come with you and do whatever is it that you're gonna do, but thank you. [chuckles] Go away. [big band music playing] [chattering] Don't let Cevoli catch you selling those to the locals. Let me tell you something. I've been in the Navy since I was 16. And our line of work is a dangerous one. One where tomorrow is never promised. Hell, tomorrow's barely a gentleman's agreement. So if there's liberty to be had... [chuckles] ...then liberty we should take. At two dollars a pack, I'll take a risk. Let's enjoy ourselves, boys. Mohring would insist. When in France. There he is. Tom. [sailor 1] Don't do anything I wouldn't do, sailor. [Marty] What do we have here? Hello. [Bo] At the Boulevard de la Croissant. Few too many sailors on this street. [Bo] Doesn't look like a street with a whorehouse on it. [chuckling] No. [Marty] You don't have enough scratch or game for these fine European women. Hey, I'm here to drink, so just point me in that direction. Oh, to the first bar we find, then. You guys go ahead. I gotta find something for Daisy. I'll catch up. All right. Hey, don't forget the, uh, lacy bits. Funny. [biker speaking French] [beachgoers chattering] [child speaking French] What's going on? Are you blind? It's Liz Taylor. The movie star. Where the hell have you been? [laughs] I'd like that. Miss Taylor. Mmm. Would you sign my postcard? Oh, I don't do signatures, darling. But I'll give you a kiss. [chuckles] Thank you, Mrs. Taylor. And who's your friend? He ain't with me. Ensign Jesse Brown, ma'am. I'm a naval aviator. Oh, they let colored folks be pilots these days? It would appear so. Well, how enlightened. Liz? I have to run, dear, but you and your wingmen should join us at the casino later. I like pilots. Miss Elizabeth? I'm sure you've noticed, but-- You just wear something smart, and you tell them Elizabeth invited you. [chuckles] [chattering in French] You're thinking it. [chuckles] Ah, look who it is. Get something nice for Daisy? Yeah, got something else, too. I was invited to the Casino de Carlo this evening. We all were, actually. By Elizabeth Taylor. [Bo] You're shitting me. Wait, Liz Taylor, the actress? How? Where? How? Met her. Where? At the beach. Nice lady, actually. [laughs] I don't believe you. But I got some money to blow. Let's see if you're lying. [Bo] Now we're talking. Put up or shut up. Fellas. Let's get dressed. Whoo! [Bill] Wow. Now, I know y'all are used to getting turned down, but I ain't. If we don't get in, doubt this is the only place in town. Yeah, but this is the only place with Liz Taylor. Allegedly. [speaking French] We were invited. I am certain you were not. Elizabeth Taylor. I believe she-- Please, sir, leave now. Jesse. It's okay. We'll go find somewhere else. Right. Okay. [speaking French] [security guard speaking French] [clears throat] This way. [jazz music plays] You sly dog. Never in doubt. [speaks French] Did you see her? This is... Oh, man! Women here are... [Bill] I think it's time to make a little money. Oh, look at this place! I think we found the party. -[partygoer] Oh, no! -[crowd shouts] Is that... Liz Taylor. That's Liz Taylor! Liz Taylor. That's Liz Taylor? She look nice. Guess I should introduce you. [Bo] Yep. Fellas? [Marty] Mm-hmm? [Bill] Never met a movie star. Kinda nervous. Well, lookie-loo. The Fighting 32. You came! Yes, ma'am. Do you gentlemen all know each other? Just sharing space at the moment, ma'am. That's right. Until the actual war starts. And then, we'll be on the ground. And they'll be nowhere to be found. [scoffs] You always talk in nursery rhymes? Please, take a seat. I could use some fresh luck anyway. Yes, ma'am. Please. Okay. Why don't you and I grab a drink and toast to not being on a ship with these guys? Come on. Good idea. Buy a couple rounds on us. I'll keep your seat warm. [Elizabeth] Put some here. Let's go, Buddy. Come on. [Elizabeth] Here. And... [Jesse] Here. [whirring] [Elizabeth] Here. [all cheer] [gasps] My lucky man. [Marty] Oh, here we go. Cheers, ladies. To beautiful people, beautiful life. Cheers. Yes, cheers. New friends, future ex-wives. Here we go. Hey! [laughs] [whirring] Whoo! [all cheer] [Bo] Mm-hmm. That's what we call a winner. Come on! About time to call it a night, Bubba. Yes! Oh, shit. [speaking French] [both chuckle] So, you speak French. I picked it up in high school. Uh, sir. Uh, whiskey, and then, whatever my friend's having. [speaking French] Show off. That was pretty good. It's good. [both laugh] Pretty wild. Rubbing shoulders with movie stars. Drinking, gambling. The Reds are about to strike, we're partying in France. [sighs] I just want to go home with this having meant something. Well... You just keep it up with Miss Liz Taylor, and you just might. [both laugh] Thank you. You forgot the ginger beer. I saw a place looked real nice. I'll get a drink from there. Hey, pal. Let's try that. Let's try that. Change of scenery, fellas. As long as this place has French women, I'm happy. We'll be jake on that front. Right, I lost all my money anyway. Come on. -[Bo] We're leaving? -Sorry. Excuse me? Miss Elizabeth, thank you for having us. It was very kind of you. Well, is that it for you boys? I'm afraid so. Hmm. Well, you be safe out there. Would you? [blows] Thank you. [dice clatters] [laughs]
