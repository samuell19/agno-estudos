--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website Let us know come to a halt this way. It is still light for two hours. - We can make camp here. Alboin, if you attack them again, victory is yours. I am right. Only I am right. You say there is still hope. That Alboin made camp. That this gives us time to organize the defense. You say we can still take Alboin to keep. Can hit him back. But I see the fear in your eyes. - You see shame about our defeat. We were in the minority but still we could have won. If the cavalry came to us on time. Amalchi and the cavalry stayed away. Just ask the generals. Yes. Why didn't Amalchi join the fight? He disappeared with his men at the crucial moment. You know Amalchi. Will you say he's a coward? Shame, father. - Rosamunde. She's right. Amalchi is certainly not a coward. But we are defeated because he failed as a leader. My brother. Amalchi. Amalchi, finally. God has protected you. I do not know. - That's blasphemy. You are saved. I would rather have died. Someone gave me false orders. We shouldn't have attacked the Lombards. They were our allies. We've been stupid. I had your advice don't have to follow up, Falisco. May God forgive you. You are king by God's goodness. You are inspired by the Almighty. If everyone had listened to you ... - Don't try to blame somebody else. |I am just giving the facts. - Amalchi. You are accused of cowardice and betrayal. Treason has been committed, but not by me. A messenger gave me new orders. - That messenger didn't come from me. I realized that too late. When I arrived, the enemy was not there. Was it one of our messengers? - He gave the password. And you had no reservations? - No, I always follow orders. We'd like to assume that ... but it is also possible that you made up that messenger. He is nowhere to be seen. - Shall I cut your tongue? Put your sword away. Use it against our enemies. - I am loyal. You can be a traitor. - That is very well possible. I know you're mad at me. That does not play a part in the battle. God knows that Amalchi is faithful to you. He just can't betray. I'll prove it next time. - We'll see that later. But now I'm taking command from you. You gave me this sword when I defeated the Goths. Now you are in doubtof a soldier's word. A wise decision. You will not regret this. You fought bravely. We are going to celebrate the victory for three days. What is it, Falisco? - Look over there. That's Rosamunde. Follow her unseen. I'm going to search our new friends. Fast. He doesn't recognize me. He thinks you are his mother. He was so young too when he came to live here. You cannot come often. - If only he could stay with us. If he knows who he is he will love you. Stay here until tomorrow. - That is not possible. And you have to leave as soon as possible. - Does anyone know about it? No, it is worse. The Lombards want to attack us. My God. - Buy horses, a wagon and provisions. Go north. What was that? Why do the dogs bark? Because of foreigners. - GO look. Take care of him, Maria. Do you remember what I said? - You can count on me. Get the horses. Now he is further away than ever. You too. - They'll get him to safety. Amalchi, why are we not going with the baby? We cannot do that. I must not renounce my duty as a soldier. You're right. That is impossible. But how long do we have to hide our love from each other? I do not know. Your father hates me since I asked him for your hand. He did everything he could to keep us apart. I will continue to love you. I only care about you and our child. Nothing will keep us apart. How can I prove myself to your father? Have patience. One day he will understand. Now he is wary of betrayal. He doesn't trust anyone. Forgive him, Amalchi. Help him, he needs you. Halt. Who are you? May the cross protect our friends. Take me to your lord. - Come with me. Greetings, Emissary of Justinian, emperor of Byzantium. Welcome. Did we necessarily have to meet here? I was concerned about your safety. - And yours. I hope so. My life also belongs to the emperor. Here is the message you have been waiting for. Your barbarians should only know that we could make words out of nothing. My barbarians? You don't know how much I despise them. I can forgive a people for everything even cowardice ... but their cultural ignorance bothers me. We understand each other completely. Justinian is smart. He's seen through my mind. Our people are defeated, but the winner can make us an ally ... and thus expand its strength. Then he is even more dangerous. Indeed. Alboin must be stopped. If he allies himself with the Gepids he can become very dangerous. We can avert this danger avert with a trick. Let's get Alboin to do it to murder the Gepids. Then we go after Alboin himself. Tell the Emperor that I helped Alboin to win. How? I have their one and only opponent sidetracked. Amalchi, of the Cavalry. - Their greatest warrior. Thanks to me, he fell out of favor. Without him, the Gepids go towards their doom. Alboin will slaughter them. He will burn everything to ashes ... as if it were this parchment. My brother, according to the seers we will be victorious. They say Alboin is unbeatable. - He should be. You can speak. - I have the right to remain silent. Why don't you want to say what you think? You wouldn't listen to me because I disagree with you. You speak then. - Our troops are standing by, Alboin. Refuse the Gepids this peace deal. And what do you think? - We must destroy them quickly. Why should we give them a respite? Do you agree with that? - Yes. And you? No. Me neither. You already celebrate the victory. Our soldiers drink and sing. They divide the treasures and the women of the Gepids already under themselves. And then? There we go fight the Avars and the Huns. I didn't want this war. The Gepids leave me cold. Why did their king attack me? Who recommended that to him? Now you will see. Here. Take this. Squeeze it. Try it. That is impossible. Do you see how easy it is now? This is what our enemies want, the Byzantines. They want to play us off against each other. And then when we're on our own they attack us. I made that up because I'm a barbarian and I can't read their books. I can read their minds. I will not attack the Gepids. I, the victor, will ask for peace. That peace will last forever. I will make our countries merge. What do you say about that? - I have the same opinion. I thought so. - Not me. Your opinion doesn't count. - I can give my opinion. The Gepids are cowards. Why should we make peace? What can they teach us except fear of fighting? You have a lose tongue, brother. Beautiful. He can use it when he wants to go to the king of the Gepids as my courier. You have to explain to him what I want. Are you happy with that? I refuse. What did you say there? No one should say that to me no one. Not even you. I won't cut your tongue brother. I will have mercy on you. I will kill you. Die fighting, as it should be. Defend yourself. Defend yourself. You won. Kill me. Do you want to talk to the Gepids? Yes, brother. You know what I want. Give their soldiers a reward from my treasury. I don't want the Gepids, I want Rome. And with Rome ... the Byzantine Empire. I knew Rosamunde from Amalchi but not that she had his child. I've seen her hug a child. Good to know. - Do you want that child? No not vet. I urgently need to speak to the king. You, what do you want? - An envoy from the Lombards is coming. Alboin talks about peace. Very well. But we should know under what conditions. We are not like the Byzantines. The conditions are fair. We offer peace, even though we can beat you like this. That remains to be seen. - Would you like to see it? Stop arguing. - He's a guest here. He wants peace. Okay, I'll talk about peace. But my brother does not shy away from it. He offers you honorable peace. Because dissatisfaction only leads to uprisings. We could Kill you now. But we don't ask for gold slaves or women. Not even about livestock. We will not occupy you. My brother the king just wants your friendship. Of course he does require a guarantee. What kind of guarantee then? Your daughter, one who will be queen of your people. Alboin decided to marry her. So will the Gepids and the Lombards ... Have one king and one queen. As a king, I feel honored and as Rosamunde's father I am happy. I agree. But my own daughter will confirm it. Speak, Rosamunde. Speak. We are waiting for you. Do you agree, my child? Your will is my law. I will be happy to obey you. Through this marriage I give our people also the chance to return home. You heard it. Tell Alboin that not only my daughter ... but I am also happy. Falisco. - Sir? Make it known. There is going to be a big party. Light bonfires. Let everyone are happy. Give everyone wine. We hold a joust in honor of the Lombards, our honored brethren. You're on the right side of the joust of the king, with my daughter. He probably wants to participate too to the joust. Then he can show how brave he is in battle. Your counselor is right, I want that. I'm better with a lance than with words. It's impossible. My brother will never give up on you. And you will never see your child again. Do you not know what your life will be like? My life is no longer my own. I am the prize of their peace. Why do you dare not to speak the truth? Just admit you wants to rule the Lombards. How can you say that? - GO away. What kind of woman are you? Insult me if you want to. May it give you strength to bear your sorrow. May you not look into my heart now SO you don't see the pain. You never said yes if you loved me. What's more important than our love and the love for our child? Don't encourage me to be weak. I cannot and must not be weak. Thousands of people depend on me. The men you in battle. And their wives and children. Think for a moment. Alboin will show them no mercy. Grace. Do you really think Alboin will give grace to our people? No. He just wants more protection against the Byzantines. And for that you sacrifice our love. Only this way can I hope to save my people. I have to do it. You don't dare to ignore your father's command. - Not true. I would have said 'yes' anyway. I am the daughter of a king. You're one of his soldiers. We both have a duty to our people. You and me. I'll figure out a way to defeat Alboin. The joust will now begin. Each participant chooses his opponent by splitting its shield. I'd like to start. - I allow that. You can choose your opponent. - Yes. Amalchi. - That is not a wise choice. Your shield, Amalchi. Ulderico is a worthy opponent. The king never allows it. IS your champion sometimes scared? - Amalchi. I'll oversee the preparations, Sir. Sylvester. Do as I told you to. A joust between Ulderico, prince of the Lombards and our champion Amalchi. The lances are protected with a metal ball ... to avoid injury. The lances are being prepared. Show us your courage. Participants, prepare. Amalchi has won. Why doesn't he get up? He is wounded. Betrayal. betrayal. Ulderico is dead. You killed Ulderico, Alboin's brother. This is treason. You betrayed us. Amalchi's lance was not blunted properly. Arrest Amalchi. This is your fault. Tell that to your king. Amalchi will be killed. That is not good enough. You shall all pay for this. Come with me. Open it up. You see? This is the death a traitor deserves. I did not betray you. - Everyone has seen it. Only you had a motive for this crime to commit. Put him in there. Stop. Father, I swear that Amalchi is innocent. Someone has disabled his lance. - Who then? Can you prove it? I would never sacrifice our people not even for Rosamunde. The facts show otherwise. - The fact is, Alboin will attack us. Take defensive measures quickly. Listen to him, father. When we're attacked Amalchi will give us the victory. Don't let the anger cloud your mind. Think first. Give him time to plead himself free. Take him away. To the dungeon. I trust on your sense of justice. Don't shed Amalchi's blood, there will still a lot of blood to be shed. You will not rest, you will not sleep until they are all destroyed. May heaven curse me if I break this oath. [, Alboin, will single-handedly behead their king ... even if I have to turn around all their corpses one by one to find him. I reached out to him and he betrayed me. I will answer him with death. Death and destruction. Ready? Defend yourself. Kill them. I swore this on my dead brother. Halt. Father. My father. I just want to see our triumphal signs here. Matilda. Matilda. Here. Amalchi. - Is Rosamunde safe? I do not know. This woman will be my bride. The wedding will be celebrated in grand style, for our people. Make it known. Didn't you hear me? I could enslave you too and Kill you, you know that. Feel free to kill me, Alboin. - No, you will be my wife. But you as a princess know how to scoff. The vanquished must bow. Only if he is afraid of dying. - You are not. No. I even hope for death. You can kill me yourself like you killed my father. I avenged his betrayal. - Then complete the revenge. Kill the queen of the Gepids. No, I'm not killing you. But someone dear to you. More precious than your own life. I know everything what there is to know about you. You are the daughter of a king and the mother of a bastard child. The queen has spoken. Now the mother will speak. Shall I ask for a sword? You know I have a steady hand. No, Alboin. No. Spare my child. - That's how you think about me, don't you? I'll save him if I get you. I bow to our lord's will. My will. Leave her. Your advice was good. You have a reward earned. Just ask. Will you give me anything I want? - Yes. Good. I don't want a reward. There is no point in offering one. If you don't want anything, you ask too much. That is wise, but I really just want to serve you. You advised the king of the Gepids. He has had little use for that. - He didn't take my advice. I said this would be suicide. Is that how you wanted to prove your loyalty? - It has been proven. But I have more proof. Your brother's murderer is still alive. Who is that? - You will see him soon. Then you can take revenge. Stand up. Kill him like a dog. A slow death. Do you see how you will die? Coward. Cut him loose. Bring him here. Stand up. Stand up. Get up, I said. Do not shoot. He must be tortured. Close the city gates, quickly. He will not escape. There he is, get him. - Close the gates. There he is. Get him. - Alboin. Alboin. I will not give you rest. We don't see him, he must have drowned. What happened anyway? The traitor has drowned. I don't like this palace. We won't be here long. - Would you rather sit in your tent? It might be less luxurious ... but you can load it in a cart. A great king must continue. - No one is as tall as you. The Romans. They have conquered the world. I will conquer Rome. - You will destroy it. You will not conquer it. What did you say there? Destroy and conquer are not the same. They are the same for you. - I offered peace to the Gepids. My brother has that mistake paid with death. The Gepids have paid even more for their mistake. But you have not overcome them yet. Whoever destroys stands alone. Can you make peace with a people you have conquered? We have to believe that. It is different like you have a wife, but not her heart. It's about possession. I don't want anyone's heart. Cold. Like ice. Like ice. What do you feel? Disgust? Disgust? I'm not a beast, but a man I'm a man. You will come to me because you have to choose the strongest. And I am the strongest. Halt. Keep them there. Lower the gate. You had summoned me. Bring in the prisoners. Get in with them now. Okay. Inside, you. Go inside. Look closely. Our customs become yours. Our prisoners suffer this fate. These are no longer your people. You only own my body, don't forget this. Quiet. Quiet. Close the gates. Rosamunde, Rosamunde. Matilda has also been captured. On my mark the beasts are released. Please I want to ask you a favor. Wait. - No, wait. Say it. - I want three slave girls. Three women. I am used to being served. - Good. YOU can choose them yourself. Don't let go of the animals yet. - Wait a minute. Backwards. Back up, I say. All to the back of the cell. - Backwards. Save us. - Advocate our case with Alboin. Save us. Only you can save us. Rosamunde. Rosamunde. Rosamunde. Talk to Alboin. Don't let him Kill us. Please. - Spare us. This one. - Thank you. Thank you. Choose me. Choose m ?, Rosamunde. Save us. - Save us. Help us. Choose me. Help us. Take me. And this one. - My queen. May the Lord bless you. Thank you. And this one. Matilda, you have been saved. Compassion can lead to betrayal and deceit. How do you mean? - You know what he means. But a precious rescue is not treason. - I want to serve Alboin. Then keep quiet, stranger. I have chosen these three as slaves. Who are they? Just three women. Three like everyone else? I chose at random, yes. - Excellent. Let's save the others too. Let the beasts starve. What do you think of that? - You know that better than I do. I give the prisoners their freedom back. All of them. Don't be under any illusions. He did this because he hoped I would be grateful then. He has the power to make men tremble for him. Now he wants me to think he's generous too. But I know better. Do you remember how it went after his victory? The looting, the violence? Did you forget that? You are clean, Matilda, and way too naive. Makes a good deed all his murders good? Why do you want to forget everything? Why do you forgive him? - I want to believe everyone is good. Can't we forget the past? - NO, we can't. I wanted to oppose his fierce advances to defend against his violence. But he don't touch me he just looks at me. And I have to control myself because I am starting to feel sorry for him. How I hate him. - I'm worried about you. I've been dead since my loved ones killed mercilessly. You still have your son. You can see him, right? Yes that is true. So that I know that I must submit to him. If only my son were safe. If only I could do whatever I wanted. What would you do then? Then I would kill Alboin. I swear on my father's body. But not yet. He doesn't care enough about life yet. I'll wait until it does. I wait until he is happy. If he's got it all, when death is terrifying ... then I will take action. Greetings, Amalchi. Welcome. Thank you for our well-treated survivors. Now I ask you for more help. With your help we can beat Alboin. Our people are peaceful. We fight only to defend us. We must attack. Alboin does everything to get more power. He's already defeated the Gepids. Now comes the next area. And then he destroys your people. They think differently. You're their leader. You decide. Don't wait. We must strike with a surprise attack. Maybe you are right. I know you. You are wise and brave. But this is a serious matter. Only God knows if you are right. A godly judgment. Yes. That will determine whether we follow you or not. Do you accept this test? Yes. - Good. Prepare the trial. It's a tough, brutal trial. I am ready. Good luck, Amalchi. Come on. You gotta get to the other side with arm's strength. Here and there the rope is almost through. It may not keep your weight. Beware of the sharp points on it rope. If you fall, you will be impaled. May God be with you. Matilda. Come with me. Say Rosamunde that we can help her. How? - There is a secret passage to the palace. It was built by the king's command. Nobody knows anything about it. But you know what keeps her here. - The child? Alboin kills him. - We save him and his mother. Beware. I know where the child is. - Can you free him safely? Yes. Tell Rosamunde we're ready to die for her and her son. Tell Justinian that he can rely on me. I know what to do. And I can send others. Have you hired killers? - Everyone is afraid of Alboin. Except for one. - Yourself? I? I hate blood. No, I mean someone else. Someone who waits until she can take revenge. Rosamunde? - She wants to avenge her father. I do not trust her. - Alboin is too cunning. But he is in love with her. Love makes blind. If you fail, only you fail. Alboin is powerful. The emperor does not want to anger him. Don't be afraid of that. May the Lord keep you on your long journey. The horses, fast. The emperor will be pleased with what has been achieved. Halt. Don't move. - An ambush. betrayal. What do you want again? Is it never right? Why is he crying so much? - If he dies, you die too. I am a soldier, not a nanny. - It's Rosamunde's son. A high-born son, I would say. Look. Look at that. Watch him crawl. Halt. Alarm. Sound the alarm. After them. - Something's wrong. Come on, come on. He has the child. - Watch out for the child. He has the child. - Close the gates. Give me that child. Give it to me. It's just a doll. Quick, the time is pressing. They surprised us. They killed four of our men. You will envy those four. Get rid of them. Torture them. IS this your whip? You can use it fight the lions. You will watch from the cross. Now there is no salvation. Are you glad you saved her life? Excellent. But that will soon change. I ask you to spare them, Alboin. You are king. You must be able to appreciate loyalty. These men knew they were one could die slow, painful death. They deserve grace. Dispose of them to the cells. Go away. Come on, keep going. All of them. Why didn't you run away too? - It could have been, you know that. Why did you stay? - You said I would choose the strongest. Will you marry me? You don't have my son anymore. My will is my own again. I can now choose who I want. I'm glad you're sincere. For you. Come on. I appreciate loyalty, but I am merciless to traitors. It is locked in there Justinian's vain hope. Open it up. Falisco. - He couldn't fool me. I read the betrayal in his eyes. Is Falisco your wedding gift? Thank you. Rosamunde thinks you are dead. She wants to avenge you and her father. Is that why she stayed behind? - Yes. And now she will strike. I don't know what she will do. Kill Alboin. and then be killed. We are ready. Come here and listen to me. Now we gotta strike during the wedding. Everyone will be fed up and drunk. If we kill the commanders, the entire Lombard army has been taken aback. Take care of the child. - Attack. I've been working day and night as you ordered me. I made a masterpiece. Go away. You were telling something. - The Gepids will attack us. And then? Rosamunde is their queen. Not anymore. The Gepids no longer exist. No, you cannot just to lift up an entire nation. Send the Gepids a message. They will follow the command from Rosamunde. Only then can we take Rome. That was your dream, Alboin. It still is. Do you believe in a woman's devotion? You want to marry her. You have to believe in it. Who knows what's going on in a woman's heart? I'm going with these five guys through the secret passage. Leave the others stand hidden away. If the gate is open, you attack. Good. Forward. We go. I'm tired of waiting. - She's coming. I was waiting for you. This is our wedding. I come to take the vow. With heart and soul? Wholeheartedly. - Without regrets? Without regrets. I want you to prove that. What do you want? Here. Drink from my cup. That is our custom. Do you think he is beautiful? Are you not scared? It's a skull, you see? I see. Do you like that skull? to look like someone? All skulls look alike, my lord. The face of death is the same for everyone. This is your father's skull. I know, Alboin. Now I believe you. Now I believe you. The wedding ceremony. Offer your husband the sign of your protection. I will protect you with this sword. From this moment on you are my wife. Cheer for the queen. Halt. Step off. Here it is, by the window. - GO look. Where are you going, girl? Come back. The night will be over in no time. The soldiers are drunk. We have to attack them. That would be stupid. Listen. Through the secret passage we get even closer. Follow me. Wait. I come later. Are you avoiding me? The Gepids are attacking us. You could have ruled next to me. What poison is running through your veins? Will revenge give you back your father? I could have given you a kingdom. Power, wealth. I could have given you love. Are you going there. Enough. We surrender. - Stop fighting. Disarm them. - We won. Long live your new king. Hurray for the king. Hurray for the queen.
