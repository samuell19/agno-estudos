OK. The white cat has gone. The cat has gone, it was startled. No, it will surprise you if you do not surprise it, especially when it jumped out all of a sudden. Let's go. All right. - You don't have one today? - No, not for today. It's cool that no visitors are here on Mondays, Mondays are terrific without visitors and better with a nice weather. But it's a little bit hazy today, it usually get hazy on Mondays. You are riding bicycles in the Palace like the last emperor. So are you. And you are riding and carrying the machines, and, with someone on your bike. I should take a photo for you. How splendid the Central Axis is! See, what a nice photo did I take! And the lighting! Wrong way, sorry for that. Even I get lost sometimes, that's embarrassing. Did I get the wrong way? Seems yes. Stop shooting me, I'm a road nerd. Bringing new relics? Yeah. To the main building. A kettle, silver kettle, the same craftsmanship with the teacup set just now. Yeah, almost, they both are incised and filled-in with black lacquer, need the same treatment, slight polish. These screens were birthday presents offered to Emperor Kangxi for his sixtieth birthday. Each of his 32 sons and grandsons made one piece. There will be an exhibition on birthday celebration at the Meridian Gate this year, and it will be on exhibition by then. A lot of wormholes. This is for the Reprodcution Workroom to reproduce Emperor Qianlong's horizontal inscribed board, need sizing at the back to make it support better. Otherwise the ink will get bleeding and feathering. This is mainly for the 90th anniversary of the Museum, an exhibition on restoration achievements. We picked this pair, for they are larger and also because of their bad damage, needing urgent repair and restoration, repairing and restoration for salvage. You need patience, and patience comes from decades of enduring practice. This work requires patience, concentration and persistence. When I was a newcomer here, Mr. Zhao assigned me a bronze bow and told me to polish it. That will practice your endurance, make you persistent and temper yourself. He will find you a lot to do. Such as giving you a pile of paper and tell you to remove the grass residues on them. You will find in the end that he do this to make you tolerant, and temper yourself. You spent half of your three-year apprentice period doing this and then some more, some new. Such as painting mounting, and finally graduated. The imperial dates, planted by my father and his peers. People here have strong flavor of life, like in your own daily life. It's not the Palace Museum I assumed. I thought that the Palace Museum is well-conditioned. When I came here, in my imagination, everyone would be like medical workers working in a clean and tidy environment with equipment all in readiness. But when I came here in person, which made you wonder if any restoration can be really done in conditions like this. I did felt very disappointed when I first came here. I still remember the day when I signed the work contract, I was standing in the narrow alley outside the door wandering back and forth, for an hour. I reached the doorstep, and turned back and reached the gate, and turned back again. It's a life change for me. When I was at school, I graduated with the best performance in my class. But I will not be able to continue my art career here. I enquired Xiao Ju, they mainly learn and study the techniques of the ancients to guide their creativity. But they are required to stop creative work. Say, I quitted creative work, and came here. He has classmates doing creative works outside and are doing well and prosperous. But you will work here unknown to public for a whole life. It is quite a temptation. It's very hard to settle down and persist, quite difficult. It's a trial for your character. Sometimes, I feel that deep inside, quite as if that I was dynamic and vibrant, but this, it is dead and still and always will be, regardless of whatever you do. All right, you win! You win the fight between us, and I got down to the research on it, to know better of it. You see the characters in the cartoons, they rose to fight in order to protect something, right? The same is true here, you are protecting something. I do not feel strong sense of mission, to be frank. But I see that in you, so why don't you be honest. Gradually, it develops in you... Protective restoration. Life your feet. The practice at that time is succession meaning to take over your parents' working position. This is my father, I was standing here. This is Qu Feng's master. She is our previous director. For the restoration factory. This is the new director who came in 1980, no,1982. This is how it looked before the restoration, the inside, and the outside. This one is of a complicated structure. Previous repair work was proved to be a failure. But it was disassembled into parts, so, this is a tough case. Seriously rusted, not easily to get repaired. Repair of clocks does not go like other static objects, which will stay static there after the repair is finished. They are machinery, and need to get running after the repair. If you find it hard for them to get running after your repair work, that won't do. The requirement for the repair may be easy, sometimes with four words only, regain its mechanical ability. These are four easy words, but contain profound and complicated contents. Can it work? Yes, this position, all right. Minor repair will do good to it, while major repair will ruin it as you cannot keep many of its original parts. But minor repair will retain its original parts, the original materials. We are expecting 9 pieces next week for minor repairs and then sent for the Precious Collection of the Stone Moat Exhibition, this will bring us more data collection. High level relics, very high level. And that is what excites us concerning the job, it makes you feel like getting stimulants injected. Some cultural relics are not at a high grading level and were not well preserved latterly, this led to damages to calligraphies and paintings, paperbrittleness, brittleness of papers, mildew stains, various damages. See, the weather here is dry in this season, and you need to turn on the air conditioner for the whole morning in order to peel it. The humidifier has been working for a whole morning to increase the humidity, we are now having a humidity of over 50 percent. Pig blood lime putty is a common material used in ancient buildings, especially in the base coat layers, base coat layer in the Qing dynasty, those of the ancient buildings, all use this. I cannot stand with it. I feel sick whenever I smell it. Well, my nose is not sensitive, at all. It is not so strong as the base coat of traditional Chinese lacquer, but it's cheaper. Large consumption of this will lower the cost in overall lacquer scraping case. Generally, we made small videos to record every step and take several photos, then we will have abundant data. You see, both of our hands are occupied when we are working, so we need someone else to take these photos and videos for us. But with this, you can take the photos very easily, and it allows you to take photos and videos when you are working. It's convenient, especially for restoration work of cultural relics. You have taken into account in your repair process what it looked like when it was broken, and when you want to take down the mending part, it can regain its original state. The less damage made to the cultural relics, the better. It's a compromise for you, an overall consideration. Not just thinking about the regain demand in the future and ignoring its intensity, you have to meet the requirement of exhibition and preservation. The basic requirements have to be met. In fact, the more you get closer to the relics, or a little bit inferior, the better. If your materials are too strong, when it get a physical hit, for example, if I glue here, when a physical hit comes, it may get broken. The color is inappropriate, do it again. It's not that complicated for an art major, but not for me, a chemistry major. When my colleagues of art major do the coloring, they get it done very quickly, precise and accurate. This time, I came out to purchase screws of the Wooden Building Clock using for the hinge, and the leg support, some glue is also needed if I find it applicable. We have only two people working here in the workroom, my master and I, the two of us. Mr. Wang became my master the day I was assigned to this workroom. We did not hold such a formal mentoring ceremony as they did in the Kungfu novels, but this is also kind of the same relationship as that in the novels, one day as a teacher, a life as a father. Let's see if Gao Fei can make it high up there, I will go and help him if necessary. My master is ill with ankylosing spondylitis. What do you think about it, Zhou? Satisfying, pretty satisfying. I am satisfied. It looks like a newly-completed piece, glowing and blazing. OK, so be it. Refer to this tail, and figure out its type including the ribbon in the front. It went downward when I first repaired it, but I find later that it is different from this one. I forget to take off the lens cap. It brings you back the history to take a walk here, full of bumps and hollows. The face of the Buddha statue is wooden, possibly with some paints on it. Different paints have different absorptive intensity of X ray. Yeah, this one seems to contain cinnabar or something else. Yes, this part seems alike with that one. And the lips, the lips, have defects, a half is missing, and the defect leads to falling-off of paints when paints are gone. The leftover will appear to be black in photos. This part is... Is it incorrectly painted? See? A triangular print... Did you play the slides backwards? No, nothing to do with the slides. Our three palm print lines go along side by side, while this, seems incorrect. This line goes across, the palm print of a Buddha. No idea how they designed this when they made it, the design should be distinctive. This is a Buddha statue for an exhibition at the Palace of Compassion and Tranquility. This piece, oh you cannot call it by that, this statue is of the Liao and Jin period. It's a wooden Buddha statue, and we our woodware group are repairing it. The statue had two of its fingers broken when it was sent here. A piece of his lower lip was missing, and a broken ribbon here. They requested that the repair should be done to make sure that it can be used in exhibitions, and did not ask for more. I think myself that it looks unsightly with two fingers broken. I think that, first, the gesture, though one piece of the finger is broken, but there are remaining parts for us to estimate the form of the missing part. Judging from the remaining and second, the clues provided by the form and size of other well-preserved fingers. So I called them and put up my suggestions. We remade a replacement for the missing finger, this will help make it an unbroken Buddha statue. It is said that incompleteness is a kind of beauty, while in fact, the missing part makes you feel uncomfortable. We repair this statue with strong basis, we will never do it without a basis. We have two different opinions now. One of them is like what they do in the west, the western theory, you retain obvious difference on the broken spot, on whatever relics you repair, clearly different from the original to prove that the part has undergone repair and restoration. It's called figurability, hoping to give the experts better understanding of the true condition. But for us, we hold a traditional Chinese theory of repairing to make it possibly close to the original state. Take facsimile of painting and calligraphy as an example, it can trace back to over a thousand years ago. Modern creations, no matter how good they are, is totally different from handwork. Inkjet printing works with printing ink, something lack of sense of texture. It can never replace the handwork, and you can never neglect handwork practice, ever. If you stop practicing, it is hard to get it back over time. I presume that the reason foreigners do not choose this method not because how they respect the original items, but that they cannot make it right. People can easily tell their repaired parts. But for us, with the real good traditional techniques, you can never tell after the restoration. And for us, I dare not say that we have all inherited what our masters can do, but more and more loss will occur to the relics with the inheritance from generation to generation. See, try to restore all the color spots. Every color-loss spot needs to inpainting twice or more. One will not be enough, one time will only leave the color floating at the surface. When you finish, it will gets better. It was dirty, originally. Come on, you do the peeling. Take it easy, and go slowly. We had a lining here just now, a little bit water on it and it will be rubbed off after we finished the inlaying work. Peel it off slowly and carefully. Nobody here survives allergy to this lacquer, those that are not allergic is only a relative situation. No, all are allergic. Nobody can be spared. This is an official ware of the Southern Song Dynasty pottery. It's rather shiny. It needs further detection. It must be a corrosion. Yes, it is. Same case with this one. What's this? alkali? Here we are. You are not hurried today, Mr. Shi. After you. Oh, come on! This is a big yard, and there is another yard backward for the pottery group, so we do not get off work and come out together at the same time. Sometimes, you have to wait for a while. Some of the pottery group are still in there. We got trained at the security department when our group first came here. We learn how to secure the door from the security guards, and were also told by the masters to shake the locks and make sure that they were locked safely. Door locked. I was the last one. Take it easy. Door locked. The clock industry have every reason and full condition to accelerate the transformation development. We are at an age of Internet+, what does the plus truly stand for? For industrialists of clock making like us, we need first, in this age, to accept new ideas and adapt ourselves to new modes. Wang Jin, Qi Haonan, focusing on clock repair and restoration at the Palace Museum, great master, proficient and skillful. You have many clocks at the Museum, water spray timer. I will not talk about gold-plating, but instead, not the ones with waterfalls, do we have pipe organ music ones? Yes, we do. You do? Let me show you mine. We have the pipe organ music clocks, animal styled ones, and varieties of other kinds. We have one of such size at the Palace Museum. Small one? Small ones are too common. Yes, small one. This one is much bigger, you see the smaller one beside? Seems we don't have such a big one at the Museum, we have a smaller one. Yes, a smaller one, there are smaller ones on the market. I just want to say that if only I have two or three pieces that the Palace Museum has not, I will feel delighted. Well, then you have good reasons to be delighted, there are too many good pieces on the market outside the Museum. Clocks at the Museum come from collections around the world, mostly from Britain and France. Early clocks, during the Emperor Qianlong's period, including those from Guangdong Province as well as clocks from the Royal Workshop, the collections should rank high among the world. Anyway, it's the royal collection in those days, almost all are boutiques from around the world, including our large-scale British clocks, you cannot even find an equivalent in the British Museum. These are clocks that are unique, almost across the world. Mr. Huang Jiazhu participated in more than 1000 auctions around the world. He has some nice pieces, the early fraction of his collection. Maybe he was just trying to have a competition with the Palace Museum collection. Weaving repair is not good for your eyes. Long time work will blur your vision. I think when I grow older, I will not be able to do this any longer. The cherry trees suffered heavy losses. The cherries? All blown off? Only a few days have passed, it's getting damp, not good for our work. The situations were good days ago, but when it gets damp, the baseplate grows deformed. The upper part may need readjustment later. I need two. I am waiting for my apprentice. You go first. Off you go. Shall I? My apprentice hasn't come yet, either. You are also waiting for him? Well, we are both masters waiting for their apprentices. My master has got me my ticket. He has got his ticket. Are you still waiting? - You go first, I will catch you later. - Gao Fei. My apprentice is still not here. You are waiting for him too? Feeling distinguished with an apprentice, huh? Sure. You are also waiting for your apprentice? All right... It's quite a nice day today. The apprentices today, how to say, are like heaven and earth compared with apprentices before. They now are highly-educated with good education background. They practiced a lot at school and it's easy to guide them, much easier than before. When in the past, you have to teach them almost hand by hand. Where did you eat? Qilaishun? No, somewhere out of the West Prosperity Gate. He is the kind of person with a good character. I learned a lot from him, that's true, and I feel content and gratified to get the chance. It's great to have such a good master guiding you, on good behavior and diligent work. There's still a lot for me to learn from him. To be a master is something pretty traditional, in a way. But the traditional part has got lost when they first came here as apprentices. They had some related background which sometimes makes it more difficult to teach than a greenhand. Do not use the paste brush on this. If you do it like this, the paste will not pile up. While if you use the bristle brush, the paste will form tresses. When you finish your brushing, there will be paste tresses. They are still not skillful enough, they are young and lack of experience, but they will get skilled with time, the more skilled, the better. We do not have too much work here, not too much, and proficiency comes with continuous work and practice. This is to preserve its moisture. Where does this cat come from? A stray cat. All deserted by their owners, and there are wild cats here too, giving birth to kittens. Our director of the Palace Museum has had the cats sterilized to stop them giving birth to more kittens, or there will be too many cats here. See, they are picky and only choose to eat the sauce, greedy cats. Cats are not so easy to raise, you know that, right? Dogs are easier, they eat what you feed them. This is something we had when we were kids, like a bird, flying high in the sky, free and unrestrained. What young people are playing nowadays? What is it called? Paraglider or what. I am a man of fantasy sometimes... full of strange ideas in my mind and hope to have a try in person. But you see, it would be quite fantastic, the feeling to fly in the sky, don't you think so? What happened? It's dead. NO! Did you do this? Why would they admit? You are talking back? Come on. It must be the three birds that killed it last night. They know the ropes. Sure they do, certainly. Admit, or I will pluck your feather. Yes, pluck the feather; you are more cruel. I began to repair Chinese Guqin from around 2006 when my master taught me how to repair them. There were indeed doubts that Guqin are musical instruments, while you major in lacquer craftwork, lacquer craftwork is not the problem for me, but Guqin is not only lacquer craftwork. It is musical instrument, too. Can you do it? Can you? So I started learning to play the Guqin, learn to make Guqin. When our predecessors did lacquer craftwork repairs as what they put it in the Records of Lacquering, written by Huang Cheng in Ming Dynasty and annotated by Yang Ming, it is said that skilled restorers can repair inferior craftworks while bad ones cannot repair the exquisite masterpieces. If you are skilled and with high level techniques, and you go and repair an item of a lower level, that's OK, no problem, you are capable of it, higher than his level, that's a piece of cake, for you. Hello, is Mr. Wang there? I'd like to speak to Mr. Wang. Hi, Mr. Wang. When will you have time to fetch the door leaf and finish the enamel repair? - Ouch. - Slow down and be careful. Gang- Here you are. Where is the item? Hand it out. Where did you hide it? I'm holding it up. Lay it down, you get the front part. Two men hold one end. But you have only one young man. One young man, and another aged young man. Come on, Mr. Wang, you help him to hold the other end. OK, here. The nails may need further processing, right? I mean the joint. This one? Be careful, it's not strong enough. Come with me, let's both hold the same end. Rise and set out. Mind the door behind you, Mr. Wang. All right, make a turn and go this way. OK, that's right, good. What a masterpiece! What we are doing now, what we get access to, these cultural relics left by the royals of Qing Dynasty are mostly arts and crafts items. They may looks like a pile of objects stay there in silence, but you will find their beauty hidden inside. When you get close to them, their true brilliance. They have some spiritual stuff underneath which makes you feel its vitality. Cultural relics are actually like human beings, and it has something to do with your spiritual realm. In this world we live, we see the world from the angle of a man. This is the relationship between man and the matter. Ancient Chinese people pay great attention to investigation and research of things. But what is that? To understand objects from your angle as a man, and discover yourself from the angle of objects, and the Chinese make a chair as if he's developing his own character. He have the same demand both on the chair and his own character. It is said that jade has six virtues, and we compare a man of noble character to a jade. In fact, jade is but a stone, what virtue can you expect of it? But the Chinese see virtues from the "stone", they get inspirations from the objects to understand the objects. And use the understanding to help improve themselves, such a process. Therefore, the ancient objects, objects in the Palace Museum are living and spiritual, that's more because people who made them blended themselves with the objects, the objects carry the idea of their makers naturally, their beauty-appreciation and their cognition. The Guqin manufacturing of the our predecessors is a complete set of techniques. It is hard to surpass their achievements. To be mysterious, it's a communication between the heaven, the earth and man himself, that is actually a self-examination of the scholars, a rational process. To make a Guqin is likewise, it needs you to do it with mental calm. The object carries the spirit of its maker, similar to the principle that paintings reflect the painter. It has good toughness. It's too small. It's all right. One and a half meters, two meters. Enough for now. Pull tight. Good, that's it. The ground is covered with plums when we came to work on Monday, all falling from the trees. When did you knock them down? The strikes just now? You came with a basin? He came with a basin. Pick me some stoned ones. It's delicious. My mouth is watering. You can have a try. Take a try. Hold by these two positions. Hook it with your hands in order not to press the hands. We follow the command of Mr. Wang and coordinate well. Let me see. Lower it down. - Is that OK? - OK! All right? Somewhere sticked? Not bad, one more millimeter. OK, there is a hole here. Golden yellow everywhere. Apricots. Are they edible, the fallen ones? I think it's OK. No problem. It's small, water will be OK for it. Rinse it, rinse it later. Add another layer of paper in front when you place it, making it easy for you to turn it over. No more worry at this stage, we need to wash off all its smudginess and clean it up. The cleaning process is not that we wash it directly with water which surprised the foreigners. It scares them. In fact, we are very cautious about it, based on the condition of the paintings, don't you agree? We will never use washing method directly on the heavy-colored works. OK, that's all right after the washing. Paste the two pages to its front, and it gets easier to be turned over, it's tougher. OK. All right, done, so flat and solid. Are the characters peeled off? Isn't that very soft? Very brittle. You need to train and cultivate successors. Traditional techniques like these, an apprentice needs several years' culturing, talent shortages may occur if we do not adopt the new. You must have successors, it's good to have new faces here. We may have three newcomers this year. I'm making a fool of myself. How to use this tripod? How to uplift it? How can I uplift it? You need to make it a little higher? Yes, raise it higher. It's too high. - Is that OK? This high? - OK, that will do. I get to know why I cannot bring it into focus, the focus point, was tuned to a mode of many focuses, yes, many focusing points. But I need only one focus, the point stays aside, losing the focus, - someone tuned it to the multifocal mode. - OK. Done? See, it's done. Current technologies have their own advantages, such as the 3D printing we just mentioned. What's its merit? If you have a part missing here, usually, we adopt a method of moulding like the missing part here, we will find a similar pattern from another position and take it as the mold. But mould release agent will be necessary in your release process, and it is pretty hard to get rid of the agent completely, leaving much oil substances on the newly developed part which will remain affecting the surface of the bronze ware. However, 3D printing is free of this problem, the general graphics computing on the ware will do no harm to the cultural relics themselves, and that will be a better protection and restoration for the relics. The materials are stable now, especially that it is preserved indoors. Therefore, it will need no further repair in at least 50 years after this repair. Think about what it's like 50 years ago, like the 1960s, what's that like? But recent years, especially recent one or two decades have seen rapid development in science and technology. There are fast improvements in materials. So, just imagine, in 50 years, people will maybe solve problems that we cannot today. Like consolidating agent that is not possible now, may be invented in the future, what we are using now is those easy-to-get tools. I water the flowers every Monday as they dry out after a weekend. Huazi. Watching Lao Shen watering the flowers? Mew, let's shake hands. Your hand, give me your hand. Mew. Follow me every time I water the flowers, huh? Hello, is Qu Feng there? Can you call him? Can you tell him to come to our workroom later and take a look at a wooden ware? OK. - Qu Feng, take a look. - What? I want to pile these two up, is it possible? Will it be crushed? Not with a support. What do you usually use as a support? Two clubs across will do. Hi, Qu Feng, do us a favor, we are trying to pile this screen up. I'm telling you that we and the wooden ware group have maintained a very good relationship. I worked in their yard for some time when I began to work here, we were working with many senior masters. Whenever we find any of those little unknown creatures, I call them to come up and help. That's pretty good time. You cannot find emotional bonds like this in commercial companies, and also, to work in an office building, no matter how fancy the building is. - It's no rare thing. - Brings you no feels unlike this. However, few are able to work in the Forbidden City, not to mention working in a bungalow of the Forbidden City. Maybe I will get no feels like this if I worked in an office building. The relationships between us will stay, but it's surely not this feel, the traditional Peking feel. We may also help each other by then, but the feel of courtyard will be no more. For the sake of the security of the relics, and their better development, moving to Xiheyan will provide us a better condition. How can we carry it away? You go first. Is it OK? A little bit too much on the other end, right? Move it back a little. The head cover, on both ends. And the upper hanging scroll have all been consolidated, and the brims too. The main silk strapping is newly added. OK, seems like a new one. Tie it up. Good, thanks. Feel relieved and have someone taken it away. Great satisfaction, right? I didn't say that. All right. That form, tear it down. Mr. Shi. - Hi, how are you. - Hi. I pay little attention to the signature. You find your joy in the process of the repair and gain your own sense of accomplishment, then the result is not so important to you. Men come and live in the world and may want to leave a trace behind, but most people think that only when the restorers repair and restore the relics can they show their value. While in fact, not necessarily, he come to know better of himself in the repair process through his communication with the relics and his comprehension. So, for him, that's where the importance lies. You may not feel that way at times, but when you look back, time goes fast, and the life of a man is really. Your time at work, these dozens of years is but a glimpse. So, if you cannot do something and make exquisite works, it is quite a pity, I think, don't you agree? If you happened to repair and restore one piece, you are lucky enough. I came to stay at the Museum when I was only three, living next to the Forbidden City. My father brought me here every day and I visited the rooms one by one from here to my father's workroom. I am familiar with every room here like that was in my own home. Though I may say that I will pack up and leave immediately once I retire, but deep down in my heart, I hate to leave, I will. If they need me back, I will be happy to be reemployed and continue my work, here. All will gather here in a minute. See, handsome, huh? Look around and see if every corner is clear and all right. You are quite familiar with this, how many years have you been doing like this? Quite right. Make sure that nobody is there. All right, mission accomplished. See you after the holiday, master.
