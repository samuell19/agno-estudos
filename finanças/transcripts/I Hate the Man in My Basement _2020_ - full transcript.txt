[Dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [Riley] Look at this dick wrinkle. Where are you taking me to lunch? - [Phone ringing] - [Claude sighing] I have to head over to midtown. They find something? No. Just a meeting. Same shit. All right, all right. Tomorrow night, though, don't go fucking bailing on me this time. It'll be good for you. Who knows, you might even like this chick. Nah, probably not. She's kind of hot, though, you know? Hot in that kind of, keep her eyes open during a BJ kind of way, feel me? - I better get going. - All right. Here. What is that, six in a row? Eight. [Riley chuckling] Yeah, well, whatever, dick, I'm coming for you next month and you owe me lunch. [Phone ringing] Oh, um... [sighing] I'm going to be unavailable for the rest of the day. - Sure, no problem. - Okay. [Tattianna] Is everything good? Are you okay? Yeah. [Tattianna sighing] Finally tracked down the mother. - Molly Kirby. - [Papers rustling] Wasn't any help. Said she hadn't seen him in months, not sure she'd tell us if she had. What about a roommate? Girlfriend? I mean, somebody has to have seen him at some point, right? The problem is, when they've been this close to the bottom for so long, it makes it easier to stay under the radar. [Claude sighing] While we appreciate you wanting to help, it's best you let us handle it. Do what you can to move on. Hey, I know, okay? I know. But you got to take it from me, this shit will eat you up inside. Consume you all together if you let it. - [Soft music] - [scanner beeping] Didn't think people actually ate these. - [Scanner beeping] - Apparently. You know, we have an organic section now, it's-- you really shouldn't eat these. Honestly, I wouldn't even feed them to a dog. Not that I don't like dogs, but like, you know. [Microwave beeping] [microwave whirring] [microwave beeping] [door thudding] [dog barking] - [dog barking] - [wrapper rustling] [pills rattling] [Claude groaning] [dog barking] [shoes thudding] [clanking] [Claude sighing] [tray scraping] [Logan groaning] [Claude sighing] [tray sliding] [Logan snorting and spitting] [clanking] [Logan panting] [dramatic music] [electric buzzing] [Logan groaning] [Logan clearing throat] [Logan sighing] [water rushing] [towel thudding] [printer whirring] [fist knocking] - [Rylee giggling] - Yeah, hey, hey, hey! - Aw. - That's nice. Good to see you! Yes, it's always good to see you, Claude. - [Riley chuckling] - Do you salsa? Hi everyone, I'm Kyra! - [Rylee] Hi. - Welcome. - Waiting on one more? - Yes. - You must be Rylee. - [Both] Yes! Oh, Riley with an I, Y two E's. - Oops. [Chuckling] - I know, right? [Both laughing] This is Claude. - Hi. - Hi. So sorry I'm late you guys. One of the little bastards pissed himself, so I can't freaking even, how are you? - Hi! - [Rylee] I'm good. - Huh, both of you. - [Riley] Hi. - Hi, delicious. - So good to see you! Good to see you, too! [Rylee] Soria, this is Claude. Claude, this is Soria. Claude. Rylee has told me everything, and it's just so... [sighing] awful. It's terrible. So, no pressure, let's just do a little dance, have a little fun, get down tonight! - Yeah? - Okay, let's get started. - [Upbeat music] - No, go back I think. Okay, better. Maybe just try and feel the music, don't worry so much about the steps. Or rhythm. - [Soria giggling] - Not bad. Not great, either. Okay, okay, maybe let's just do a little spin. - [Claude] Yeah? - Yeah. So we're going to step out - and spin into our partner's arms. - Okay? [Upbeat music] - [Rylee] Nice. - [Friends applauding] Just that easy, ready? - [Man] Yes. - Okay. Oh, oopsie, oh, sorry. [Kyra] And five, six, seven, eight. - [Soria] Fuck! - Oh, you, ah, yeah, that's-- oh, shit, shit, are you all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, fine, fine, fine. [Soria screaming] - Are you all right? - [Soria] Ah, yeah, s-- shit. Yeah, I think I just, uh, she went a little fast - and I missed my count. [Screaming] - [Claude] Yeah, get her up. - [Riley] We'll get you up. - No, you guys, stop. Ah! - [Riley hushing] - [Soria groaning] [Riley] Up, up, up, up, there we go. - Ah, ow. - Okay, keep going. - [Claude] Oh, God. - It's okay. Let's get you to sit down. - Okay, ah! - That looks bad. - [Soria groaning] - [upbeat music] - You're so strong. - Oh, yeah. [Claude] We're going to put you right here. - [Riley] There we go. - [Soria panting] [Riley] Get it, oh, there we go. [Groaning] I'm fine. I'm fine you guys. I-- Can I help? Can I get you some ice or something? Oh, no, no. - Thanks. - [Soria groaning] - [Rylee] Okay, um. - [Soria groaning] - [Riley] Oh, jeez. - Um, maybe, maybe just some - Ibuprofen or-- - Yeah, no problem. I'll grab something. Or just a ride home would be nice. She's on your way, you should take her. Sure, yeah, no problem. Rain check? - Yeah. - [Soria groaning] How about you two, you want to finish up? Uh, well, we're here. - What do you say, Ry Ry, huh? - [Foot stomping] - [Soria groaning] - Olé! [Chuckling] - Here you go. - [Riley chuckling] All right, here we go. Let's go, come on. [Soria giggling] Ah, well that's usually the problem though, isn't it? But I am a pretty good judge of character. I can tell a person's appearance just by looking at them. - That's impressive. - Yeah. What I can't seem to tell is whether they're married or not. The last two, oh, maybe three relationships? All married guys. Can you believe that? I don't know, maybe it's just they're pent-up primal desires that I'm attracted to? Or maybe I just have this scent that attracts married guys? I don't know. Is this it? Oh, yeah. Are you in a hurry? - [Claude] Okay. Yep, sorry. - Oh, got it. Okay. - [Claude] Yeah. - Yeah, it's uh... [sighing] it's just all the way... [panting] at the top. [Claude] Yeah, figured. - [Soria groaning] - Okay. - [Soria] Okay, ooh! - Yeah, okay. [Soria] Oh, shit. Ah! [Claude] Maybe if you just, we just power through - real fast then, huh, yeah? - [Soria groaning] Or not, okay, we'll go slow. - [Soria] Ow. - Oh, okay, are you all right? - [Soria] Oh! - Okay, I'll put you-- - Okay, right here is good. - Right there, okay. [Soria groaning] - Okay. - [Soria groaning] Yeah, yeah, okay. [Soria gasping] - Okay, so. - [Soria gasping] - Thank you. - You're welcome. [Lips smacking] [dramatic music] [Claude sighing] [light clicking] [Claude sighing] [Logan groaning] [thudding] [Logan groaning] [Logan grunting] Did you bang it out? Porn? No, and, uh, no. - And, uh, no more setups. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Huh. God, I swear she just smelled horny. [Riley chuckling] Oh, well, whatever. Can we talk about that instructor, though? What is that all about? Ah yeah, you know. [Chuckling] Rylee was all like, "Would you please stop poking me with that thing? What is your problem?" And I was all like, "Sorry, sweetheart, you're just such a sexy dancer!" [Riley chuckling] She didn't buy it. She knew it was strange boner. Hey, where are you going? Uh, I've got a lunch meeting. - [Riley] What? - Yeah. Oh, all right. Don't mind if I do. - Yeah. - [Laptop thudding] Your secret's safe with me. It's all right. [Clapping] Thanks. [Birds chirping] [soft music] ¶ Ah it's the bait come here ¶ [birds chirping] [car engine rumbling] [birds chirping] [Kyra giggling] [train crossing dinging] - I'm sorry-- - Stop. No, listen. Listen, man, you got to let me tell you, okay? - I'm just trying to tell you what-- - Stop. - I'm, I, you got to let me tell you what I was-- - Stop. I didn't, I didn't-- Enough! [Slamming] I didn't, I didn't mean to do it, okay, I, s-- - [Logan groaning] - [electric buzzing] [Claude sighing] Look, you got to just let me tell you what happened! Okay, you got-- - [electric buzzing] - [Logan groaning] What are you going to do with me, huh? You going to keep me down here forever? What don't you just fucking get it over with? [Chain rattling] - [fist thudding] - [Logan groaning] - [fist thudding] - [Logan groaning] [soft dramatic music] [steps rushing] [water splashing] [soft dramatic music] [Claude panting] [Logan coughing] [John] There, there really isn't, but something you know. - But, but, but, I mean-- - John? John! John, this is, this is what I'm hearing, John. I'm hearing that you don't trust me, John. - That's what I'm hearing. - [John] No, no, no, that's not. - No? - No, I'm telling you. No, no, stop. - But it just, I'm going to try-- - Stop, listen. John, this, this is what I want you to do. I want you to call every shop in town, John. I want you to take copious fucking notes, John. And, and, find that magic, hocus pocus fucking deal, okay? And when you realize that it doesn't exist, and that what I'm offering is legit, then I want you to call me back so I can tell you to fuck off, John. - Oh, is that so? - You know, you know what? Yeah-- since I'm a busy guy, I'm going to save us both the effort. Fuck off, John. [John] You know what? You're right, you're right. The offer's fair, I trust you. You've been a straight shooter with me and I, - I'll tell her we're going with you. - Good. Then send in your shit. You should ask her out. Who? What, the instructor? Yeah, Kyra. [Riley gasping] Kyra, Kyra. Uh, oh, Kyra, oh, oh, Kyra! [Chuckling] Just saying her name gives me a fucking mouthgasm, dude. I was so mad at Ry the other night, I started thinking about her while we were having sex. Oh, it was nice. Super quick, though. Um, just in, out... [popping] right on her stomach. - Ugh, how do you, how do you-- - What, oh, dude, that shit goes both ways. Trust me, that's why it works. I promise you, as far as she's concerned, I was Channing fucking Tatum digging her out, going deep, giving her the old Magic Mike. [Grunting] I don't care. You know, you, you are like some kind of poetic yet filthy savant, you know that? Whoa, I like that. Come on, ask her out. - Not happening. - Ugh, come on dude, I know it's weird and there's some unwritten rule, but I, I got to say man, half the time I don't know what to say or how to act around you. In fact, what I do know is that I am of zero help or comfort to you most of the time, all the time! Ugh, dude, you are fucking miserable. And she wouldn't want it like that. [Muffled talking] [soft music] [birds chirping] [car engine rumbling] [Claude sighing] [car engine rumbling] [birds chirping] [car engine rumbling] [keys jingling] [keys jingling] Hi... [sighing] Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Claude, right? Friend of the Rileys? Yeah, that's me, yeah. So, can I help you? Yes, yeah, um, yeah, I, I was, um, I was thinking about, um, getting back in to it, maybe? You know, uh, just, just, uh, just a couple of lessons. Lessons, you want salsa lessons? Yeah or, um, you know I-- I've always been interested in the, um, the foxtrot. Foxtrot? - Uh, that's a shame. - It is? Yeah, I mean after you pussed out the other day and did that whole duck and cover drive away thing? I thought maybe this time you'd, uh, sacked up to ask me out. [Chuckling] What? No, I didn't, what are, I, I, I didn't. - I did. [Chuckling] - You did. - [Kyra giggling] - I did, yeah, I, that-- um, would you, would you like to have dinner with me? Sometime, um, in the, in the near future? Yeah, I would. Sometime in the near future. Okay. [Stairs creaking] [soft dramatic music] [soft dramatic music] [Logan gasping] [Logan whimpering] [intense music] [Logan sobbing] [sobbing] [intense music] [bag crinkling] [intense music] [Logan crying] [Logan coughing] - Well? - Molly Kirby? - You got her. - I wonder if I could talk to you about your son, Logan? Look, I done told you, motherfuckers, I haven't seen him. I'm not with the motherfuckers. You're a real funny asshole, huh? I just want to talk. [Ashtray rattling] I'm sure you're not fucking shocked to find out that I wasn't the most nurturing of mothers, hm? - [Lighter clicking] - [dog barking] Tough love, you know? It's good for kids. What about the, uh, his dad? Is he still around? You're fucking kidding, right? Is this some sort of talk show shit? - You're right. - Just line them up and point and, uh, there you go. Call Maury. Congratulations, you are the father. What about as a kid? - What was he like? - What was he like as a kid? I don't fucking know. He was a fucking kid! What are you writing, uh, a biographical or something? Hm? You, you got some rich guy guilt? - No, I'm not, um, I'm not, uh, writing-- - Well then what the, what the fuck? What are you after? I-- I don't know. What, are you lonely? Because that's maybe something I can help with. No. No, thank you. [Molly laughing] He says, "No, thank you." You are a funny asshole. You still haven't told me why you're looking for him. Logan, he, um... He-- - I'm wasting my time. - [Molly] Hey, oh, what's your name? It's Claude. [Claude sighing] Hey, buddy. Got John's package back. It's a big one. - [Zipper buzzing] - I'm proud of you. Great, thank you. Um-- Just, uh, double check the signatures and... - [zipper buzzing] - ...um, leave it on my desk. - All right. - [Claude] Okay. Yep. Ah, there he is! Yeah, yeah, what, what! I got to run, I'll call you later. Oh, oh, oh, bro, I need a solid! Wife's got us going to this wine and paint bullshit tonight, I need a wing man.

Good for first dates, you, you read that? - Online, yeah. - [Kyra giggling] It's, it's really stupid. It's so dumb. [Both laughing] So, um, your friends. - The Rileys? - Mm-hm. They're weird. They really, really are. [Kyra laughing] I got the feeling that I was the subject of some masturbatorial ritual. - Is that a word? - I, I think so, yeah. [Chuckling] I think so, or it should be and, uh, you were. Oh, God, it's flattering, right? I don't know, I, you know, he, he masturbates to those, um, to those hamburger commercials, - Oh, my God. - So-- Okay. - [Chuckling] - You know, my ex was like that. I used to catch him, like, every other day. - Really? - Really. We used to go through paper towels by the dozen. Always in front of a mirror. - Fetish thing. - Fetish, um, the, the paper towels? No... [chuckling] the mirrors. A nightmare in fitting rooms. Yikes. It was cato-something-philia. Married and divorced within a year. How about you, ever married? Yeah. Okay and? You know all about my pud whacking ex. - [Chuckling] - Out with it. What, divorced? Did it get ugly? Oh, lesbian? Come on, please tell me she went taco! Yes? So, what did she go butchy or like TV porn pretty? She passed away. Um. Oh, shit. Ah, shit. I don't, I don't know what-- I don't what to say, um-- Tell me you're joking, you-- You're fucking with me?

No, no, no, no, I, I still want to hang. I mean if you do. [Chuckling] It's just, I, I fucked this up, - and, and the smell of this fusion. - [Claude laughing] - And, and the lesbian thing, and-- - Yeah, honestly, look, um, there's, there's no way you could have known. Okay. [Chuckling] Um, I'm sorry, you, you had something else planned? Um. Yeah, I, yeah. - Get out of here though. - [Bell dinging] As a kid, when I'd get all messy, my dad would always like lick a napkin and wipe my face with it. Oh, yeah, I remember that. And the, uh, this smell of his own spit. And, ugh. - [Laughing] - It must be like a... A weird, instinctual dad thing, yeah? - Hm. - Yeah. [Kyra laughing] Wow. [Kyra laughing] Yup, that's it! Thank you very much for helping me relive that trauma. [Kyra laughing] This date, bad food, ice cream, [laughing] I feel like I'm 15 and you're going to try and feel me up at any minute. Nah, I, I, I thought, um, a bit of nostalgia would be fun. Mm-hm. So, what's next, putt putt and making out - on the Kingdom of the Dinosaurs ride? - [Both laughing] Ah, second date. Hm, that's usually when I go for boob, too. So, you're safe tonight. - Hm. - Yeah. Wow, that you know, it used to take me like hours to work up to that kind of courage. I feel so cheap. - I'm sorry. - No. Here you go. Go on. Just a quick feelsy, only fair. [Claude chuckling] [Claude chuckling] - Boop. - [Claude sighing] [Kyra] Yeah? - Mm-hm. - That's it?

She's... - ...she's interesting. - [Logan scoffing] Interesting? [Intense music] [shoes thudding] You going to call her? - Should I? - For sure, yeah. Isn't there, isn't there some kind of rule? Nah, nah, man, nah. See that's, that's some old school shit. You should call her. Hey, how's, how's my mom? Good. - Worried about you. - [Scoffing] Yeah. Hey, hey, dude, do you mind the TV maybe?

Yeah, I, no, I'll swing by, mm-hm. Okay, easy enough. Okay, all right, I'll see you then. Okay. All right. [Claude sighing] [scanner beeping] Hey! Look who's off the dog food... [chuckling] Remember? Yeah. I guess so, yeah. Thanks to you. Aw, really? Awesome. [Cashier scoffing] At least there's progress. [Soft music] [shoes thudding] [chain rattling] You called her? She did. So you've dance before? Uh, a little. Yeah, I'm a little rusty, you know. Yeah, I thought so. - Yeah. - Decent moves. And you can always tell by someone's walk if they have rhythm. [Claude] Ah. So what was it, ballroom? Tap, maybe? A little. Hip hop mostly. - Fuck off. - Yeah. Real life B-Boy. Shut up, you're such a liar. No, no. A little popping, locking. Okay, challenge. Challenge accepted. [Groovy music] ¶ Stop ¶ ¶ Stop ¶ [Claude snapping] Is that a C Walk? Yeah. Yeah, you know, gangsta. You know, just, uh, hustling them streets. Trying to earn that dollar. Uh, it was, um, yeah, it was, uh, just for girls, and to impress girls. - Is that right? - Mm-hm. - Is it working? - A little bit. Yeah? Good, you know, because usually, actually after I, um, after I do something like that I'm like, "yo girl, you want to freak this?" - Freak? - [Both laughing] I completely forgot about freaking. Oh, yeah, hm. Hold that thought. [Soft music] See what you got. [Claude laughing] [soft music] [laughing] [muffled talking] Mm, yeah, get in there. Does freaking always make you this hungry? - Mm-hm. - Hm? Yeah, it's why I was so fat in high school. - Huge. - Hm. I'm just glad they didn't have that intervention show back then, you know. Because my family would have been like, "Claude, we love you, but we're worried about your freaking. It's really gotten out of hand." Same here, but mine would have been for anal. - My mom was pretty protective. - [Claude gasping] No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. - She didn't care. Loved the butt stuff. - [Claude laughing] No. [Claude laughing] [muffled whispering] [crickets chirping] Well, again, sorry about that. [Kyra] That's all right. Now we know why I choose restaurants and the movies. [Claude] Deal. [Door creaking] Coming in, you weirdo? I'm all out of Boone's Farm. - Aw. - Regular wine okay? Ha, perfect, yeah. Mm. So, how long have you had the studio for? I have had the studio for two years, Claude. [Claude sighing] And is it, um, something, you, you, always wanted? Yeah. Yeah, I always wanted to own a shitty little dance studio since I was a little girl. Life goal, complete. So, it's going well? Um, - you-- - Just stop. That's plenty. You can just. [Soft music] [gentle music] - [Claude gasping] - Oh! [Gentle music] Are you okay? - [Claude crying] - Um-- I'm sorry. Oh, my God, are you, are you? I can't. Oh, my. [Gentle music] [Claude muttering] [door slamming] [Claude sighing] How's the book? It's not bad now that I'm getting' used to it. It's a book that she was reading when I saw her. The book, um, the first time I saw her, she was reading it. That, that book. Oh. Well, you know, this, this is the first book that I ever read. [Chuckling] As in like, the first time I ever read any book. You know, that wasn't like a kiddie book or something. It felt like I was, uh, cheating on her. She was there, and... ...she's on my lap, and all I can think about was her. Yeah. [Chuckling] You know the, um, the first girl I ever got with was this red-haired chick named Martha. And normally I-- I am not into shit like that, but you know, but Martha she was like, like, damn. And I was like, whoa. [Chuckling] Skin all creamy and shit. And I-- I didn't know what I was doing, but you know, Martha she knew some things. [Chuckling] Yeah, she knew some things. But like ever since her it's all been downhill. It was like nobody is good enough. You know, nobody has that magic touch. So, finally I just, I started asking girls to do things like Martha would do. You know, I, I wouldn't say like, "Hey, do it like Martha's doing it." But I would like kind of instruct them. But, you know, Martha was always there, in my head when I was with the others. So. [Claude sighing] [muffled talking] Yo, I think you got problems. What? The detective guy is here to see you, ha ha! So, do you like being a detective? [Claude] Detective McGee? - [Detective] Been that long? - [Claude] A few years, yeah. Hey, so did you find something or...? Got a call from Molly Kirby. Right. She, um, said you stopped by. Got the impression you were from our office. She got, I didn't tell her that. Why were you there? - I don't know. - You don't know? I don't. Look I get, uh, confused. Anxious, and, and, and-- frustrated that you know, you guys haven't. She said you threatened her. What, no. No, absolutely not! What's that about? What's what? I got a bag in the garage. Just letting off a little steam. Right. [Birds chirping] Well, uh, you should get some gloves. [Soft music] You just left, nothing, not a word? Mm, no, I, I, I, um. [Claude sighing] I, I might have mumbled something, and, and, and then it's all kind of a-- But like her stuff was out, right? I... ...might have been crying. Oh, oh. But her skin was soft? Her body tight, like dancer tight? Hm, I'm sorry, that's totally fucked up. I'm sorry. That's terrible, it's terrible. - The crying, I mean. - Yes, yeah, I know. - Thank you. - It's terrible. You want some noodles, maybe? Make it better. ¶ Noodles make you happy ¶ [soft music] [Claude] Oh, hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, I'm, I'm so sorry about the other night. No, you, you, you don't have to, um, apologize at all. I'm sorry. Um, you're, uh, you're wonderful. And I'm, um, I'm yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty fucked up right now and, I like, I, I don't even-- I get it. I really like you, though. I like, I mean, I really like you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, but I, you know, I'd understand, you know, if af-- after that. The crying? So I was actually crying? Yup. - Oh, God. - It was kind of cute. - Really? - No. [Laughing] But, you know, maybe it'll make a good story someday? Yeah, something to relive over and over and over again. Yeah. So... ...do you want another round? That is if I promise not to try and have sex with you? I think that's agreeable, yeah. Then it's a deal. Deal. I finished the book. Cover to cover. It feels kind of good. Yeah, I think I know what you mean. Like, you know, when the, when pages get thinner on one side - and fatter on the other. - Yeah, exactly, exactly. I mean, I don't understand most of the shit, but like... [chuckling] there's some funny ass females yo. And them be like, like, they fucked up, too, but like in a way that makes you say like I get you. You know? [Claude chuckling] [muttering] And that fucking Nancy, right? Wait, I don't, I don't remember a Nancy. Nancy. - The author? - Yeah, her. Oh, my god, dude, she's just like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, just like dropping one gem after another. And she's kind of mean, but like, like sassy, too, so it's sexy. [Chuckling] And they supposed to be all hoity toity and shit, but they like fucked. They fucked. All the way. Kind of tells you about people, huh? Yeah. Shit's wild, man. - [Car door slamming] - Wow! You weren't kidding. - [Car door slamming] - [keys jingling] I have to warn you, I am very, very good at this. - Yeah, sure. - Mm-hm. What is that? - This is, um... - [putter thudding] ...my putter. You bring your own putter? It's better than the rentals. No, no way, put it back. - What, why? - Who brings their own putter to miniature golf? No, no it's embarrassing! No, come on, it's not embarrassing. I would rather sit in front of those teenagers with you weeping on my breasts again, before being seen with a man who brings his very own grown-up putter to miniature golf. [Upbeat music] [ball thudding] [Kyra moaning] - Oh, well done! - Thank you. - Mm-hm. - [Kyra chuckling] [upbeat music] [ball thudding] [chuckling] Uh, uh, uh, no, no. - What? - You follow that through, there are no gimmes.

[Laughing] Awesome time. Sorry you lost. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you are, yeah. You know, if I, if I'd only had my putter-- You'd be a sad, sad lonely man with no friends. I don't know. I think, um, think that little kid, I think he was into me. He winked, I think. - No. - Mm-hm, yeah. I missed that. Thank you. Thank you. So, uh, Riley's having a birthday party tomorrow night and, technically, I don't have to get him a present if you were to show up with me. Look at you. First pimping me out to the golf kid and now this. And I'd really like it if you came with me and I got to spend another night hanging out with you. Okay then. Damn it. I must really, really like you, too. - Hm. - Because I've had actual nightmares about him and the things he might do to himself. Then thank you. - Peace out. - [Claude chuckling] [dramatic music] [Logan groaning] [dramatic music] I've been busy. [Claude sighing] It's one of my favorites. [Logan groaning] It's thick. - Yeah. - Nice. [Upbeat music] [man] You're probably right about it. - [Man] Fuck, yeah. - [Upbeat music] I'm telling you, I mean seriously dude, if my wife-- - [Claude hushing] - What, oh. - Hi. - Hi. Kyra tells Tattianna and I that you are quite the dancer. She's exaggerating. - No, I'm not. - [Claude] Yeah, she is. You have moves. - Downright freak this one. - Oh, freaky! [Laughing] Okay, drinks, drinks, refill? Mule, Cosmo, Cosmo, Goose and tonic, yeah? [Riley] Oh, Goose. - Riley, why don't you come join me? - What? I've got two hands and we need four drinks, so. - [Riley] Okay. - [Claude] Come on. Seriously, you guys are like a perfect match. Oh, no, we're just chilling. You know, with his stuff. Oh, my god, I know. And he's like the best. Like, literally the best guy ever. Like, literally and his wife... [gasping] ...so super-duper great, too. - Oh, you, you knew her? - Mm-hm. Yeah, we, we haven't really talked about it. [Sighing] I think it's too much for him. Well, I just hope they find that fucker. I'm sorry, what? Uh, who? The guy, you know? They haven't caught him yet. To think he's still out there. Claude is like an angel, because I would be out there with a gun like, seriously. [Claude] Ladies. - Hey. - Here you go. - Yeah. - Thank you. I think I spilled on myself. [Tattianna giggling] [upbeat music] [Claude chuckling] At least now, you know, we'll both be having nightmares. Right? Honestly, I've never even seen them like hold hands, let alone doing whatever they were doing. - You okay? - For sure. [Chuckling] [soft dramatic music] Are you sure? Yeah, I just, uh, Tattianna was telling me about your wife. I am so sorry. Well, you could have just asked me. No, I didn't, she just started going, I didn't ask her. Right. I wanted you to know that I want to be here. However long it takes you, I want this. Yeah? Yeah. [Gasping] [soft dramatic music] Okay. [Soft dramatic music] Can we just, um, can we just talk about Riley for like, one more second? - Please? - [Kyra laughing] I'm sorry, I didn't want to think about him just now. I really didn't, but it's just what he pulled back there, it's just come on. - Come on, drink up. - Ah, God bless you. - You'll feel much better. - Was it embarrassing? Hi. - Good morning. - Ah, yes it is. - [Tattianna giggling] - Where do you think you're going, Mr? - Stop. - I want to know everything. - Stop. - I think you've got a story to tell. - Stop, stop! - Hey, what, what, what, what? [Clearing throat] So? So. [Chuckling] So we, we, we hung out all night, and-- We binged watched some TV shows and we ordered pizza. [Tattianna sighing] Um. [Knocking] And? - No. - No?

Yeah, I do. What, I do! I mean, I, I like romance and shit, too. You know? And, ah, I'm, uh, I'm just happy that you're happy, man. - [Riley sighing] - Oh. Oh, man, I, I'm so sorry, - I should have, I should have been there for you. - What? With the whole wine and paint thing. Because look at you, you went ahead and you... ...you grew a vagina. - Oh, you fucker. - [Claude laughing] Yeah, right, but like, I'm, I'm thinking he's a straight fucking perve, you know? Like, sick. Uh, uh, he's just sitting there watching, getting a boner and shit? What the fuck is that? And, and, okay, look, he's funny as shit, I'll give you that. But, like, I got a little sister, you know? I didn't know. - No. - Yeah, man, so I, I, I can't get down with that. You know? Yeah, I think you have to read it a couple of times. Yeah, at first it's pretty graphic, yeah. Oh, fuck it, I got the time, right? [Logan clearing throat] I read it every couple of years. Changes every time. There's a movie, too. They made a movie? - How the hell did they ever make a movie out of this? - [Claude chuckling] I don't know, man. Look, like what if you were a dad? Now you'd beat the shit out of him, right? Look, I am not the most accomplished journalist and shit, - but if my-- - [doorbell ringing] [dramatic music] [gasping] [dramatic music] [doorbell ringing] [dramatic music] Hi, surprise. - [Chuckling] Yeah. - Well, I was hungry and I wanted to see you. That okay? Yeah, yeah, of course.

[Dramatic music] I tracked-- I see, okay, I tracked him down... - Don't. - ...and he. I didn't know what to do, okay? - I, I, I was, I was-- - You did, you did what? - You tracked him down? - I just, I just, okay, can we, can you just come back in for like one second. - Can you come back in, we'll talk. - No. - He's the guy? - Yeah. [Panting] - This is so fucked, Claude. - I know. - Really? - I know, I know, I know. - Can we just talk? - Talk? I'm not having this conversation! You're torturing a person in your basement! - I-- I know, I-- - What are you doing? What, are you just keeping him? - [Stuttering] I don't, Kyra-- - What? I should have just stayed the fuck away from you. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Can you just, um, can you just come back in for one second? - Come back? - And we'll talk for one second. Talk about what? I'll explain, I'll explain everything. - Explain? - It's pretty clear. [Sniffling] Son of a bitch, Claude, I can't! I-- Fuck, I have to-- What if it was you? I didn't know. What would you have me do? I-- I didn't know what to do! I didn't know, please. What am I supposed to say to that, Claude? What? I'm supposed to be flattered? No, no, I was, I-- You have a man chained up in your fucking basement, Claude, that's not exactly happily ever after for me. [Claude gasping] Kyra. Kyra. [Claude panting] [stairs creaking] Did you... [panting] what did you say to her? - Look, I didn't say anything. - What did you say? I swear to God, I didn't say anything to her! - What did you say her? - No, no, no, no! - [Electric buzzing] - [Logan groaning] [Logan choking] [Logan gasping] [fist thudding] [Logan gasping] [Logan choking] - [bottle shattering] - [Logan gasping] [Claude] Do it. [Logan gasping] [Claude] Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. Do it, do it, do it! Do it, do it! [Bottle shattering] You fucking coward! You fucking coward! [Panting] You fuck-- [Logan gasping] [Logan deep breathing] You took, took her from me. [Logan gasping] You took, you took, you took... [panting] ...took her from me. [Sobbing] [Logan gasping] [Claude panting] [soft music] You want to talk about it? You good? What? Yeah. Whatever, yeah. [Piano music] [teacher] Really try to channel the artist's vision. [Rylee] I think I'm going to jump off the bridge. [Teacher] Capture his determination. [Rylee] This was supposed to be fun. His passion. Why did he choose this subject? Why are you here, right now recreating it? Sipping wine. [Wine splashing] [Riley laughing] - Powerful. - [Riley] I thought so myself. [Piano music] [canvas popping] [Soria gasping] [Logan groaning] [Logan gasping] Are you done? Are you done? Good. Uh, that is a very interesting strategy and considering that I am absolutely confident that you are way too fucking stupid for me to help. All the best. Let's go, they're waiting. Come. - This is anti-climatic. - [Riley] Woo, hoo! I know, I know, he's never there. We're all standing around - like we don't know-- - All right. - Is he coming? - Yeah, he was just on the phone. - There he is. - [Lita] All right, are we all here? Thank you, slow poke, okay. Another big year folks! - Yeah! - [Employees applauding] You guys were amazing! Seriously, oh, oh, that's weird. There's something, I'm sorry, there's something scratching. I don't know what that, oh, that's weird, it's a check. Did you put that in? - No. - No, okay, that's weird. - [Gasping] - Oh, it's for $15,000. - Woo! - [Employees applauding and cheering] Whoa, that is a nice-- Oh, oh, my God. - What? - Is there something? Do you see any? - What? - I have this weird thing sticking out of my-- - [Tattianna] Yeah, it's here. - [Lita] It's like caught on my Spanx. - Yeah, there's something. - [Grunting] All right. - Oh, this! - [Tattianna gasping] I remember, okay, I remember I put this in my, all right, two tickets for an all-expense paid trip to - Hawaii! - Hawaii! [Employees applauding] ¶ Hawaii, Hawaii ¶ [Tattianna and Lita giggling] [Lita] Oh, my goodness. So, you know, just a little something to congratulate number one sales person of the year. Wonder who that could be? There's no suspense, look, this person has had a rough year. Right, we, we can all acknowledge that. I mean, he's been through some things that we can't even imagine, and... ...the thing is he, he persevered, you know? And he showed up every single day and he kicked some ass, and that's-- that deserves some applause. [Sighing] This person is someone to be admired. Claude Vaughn, where you at? Where is he? - [Lita] Get over here! - [Tattianna] Yeah! - [Applauding] - [Lita] Give it up for our number one sales rep! - Come on down. - [Riley] Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude. - [Lita] Come take the tickets. - [Riley growling] - [Lita] You got it. - [Riley] Woo, hoo! Now you get your spanking! I'm going to spank you! No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, that would be harassment. All right. - Ah, there you go. - [Riley] There it is. - Number one, number one! - [Riley] Yeah, buddy. - [Employees cheering] - Congratulations. Great job. Who would have thought it'd take something like this for me to get clean, huh? [Logan chuckling] I can't even remember the last time. I needed money, I wanted-- I wanted money. To score. It was-- It was getting pretty bad. We were, we were supposed to be in and out. And I saw her standing there off to the side. She didn't look scared, or nothing. She had nice stuff. You know, big bag, big rings. So I walked over to her. She was real pretty. I snatched her bag and I say, "Give me the fucking rings." She wouldn't do it. She wouldn't do it, she-- It just made me mad. She made me real fucking mad, man, so I said, "Give me the fucking rings," and I'm pointing my gun in her face. I was just trying to scare her, man. I swear to God I was just trying to fucking scare her. [Head thudding] [sniffling] Fuck. Hey, well, fuck it, you know. [Sniffling] There are no, there are no excuses. Do what you got to do, man. I get it. Do what you got to do. [Logan sniffling] [dramatic music] [Logan sniffling] [dramatic music] [Logan sniffling] [Logan sighing] [birds chirping] [pages flipping] [piano music] I'm just going to take some time. Maybe use those tickets. [Chuckling] - Good. - There's just a-- a few things I've been pushing off for a little too long. You're right, well, you know what? That office is going to be waiting for you whenever you're ready. And you know what, maybe even a bigger one. [Lita hushing] I appreciate that. Next time not next to the shitter. That'd be nice. - Okay. We'll see you. - [Claude] Ah, okay. - Okay. - [Riley] Ah, yes, it's nice. All right, thanks. Thank you. - We're going to miss you. - Oh. - Okay. - We're still going to chill, right? Yeah, yeah, of course. - Okay. - Okay. All right buddy, we'll see you. - [Riley sighing] - Hold me. No? She's clean, she drives pretty well, she's a little banged up, but, uh, you want to take her for a test drive? [Keys jingling] [scanner beeping] Hey, look at you! I'm so proud. [Chuckling] Thank you. [Food sizzling] [pans thudding] [food sizzling] [pills rattling] - [dramatic music] - [food squishing] [dramatic music] [crunching] [dramatic music] [somber music] [trunk slamming] [somber music] [door slamming] [car engine rumbling] [somber music] [somber music] [crickets chirping] [tires crunching] [train horn honking] [Logan groaning] [Logan panting] Whoa, whoa. I need you to listen to me. As far as I know, you died in that basement. [Dramatic music] [car door slamming] [car engine rumbling] [Logan sighing] [dramatic music] [Logan sniffling] [dramatic music] [soft dramatic music] [chain rattling] [chain thudding] [Claude sighing] [birds chirping] [Claude] Thank you for... ...not calling anyone. I didn't know how to... ...tell you, that I, I, I, had my... [chuckling] wife's... ...murderer. [Soft music] You know, or what you'd think of me if I did. Yeah, tough one. I thought about calling. You, not the police or anything. That's not true, I almost called. It's hard to digest. I mean I tried to understand it. [Soft music] And then I just think that you're an insane person. [Soft music] Yeah. Been there. [Soft music] And? He's gone. [Soft music] I, I, I let him go. [Soft music] The Rileys came in for another lesson. Got in a fight and left. I mean, they bought like a dozen lessons, so. I think she might get-- I got these tickets and stuff to Hawaii. I won them at work. It's seven days, and massages, the whole works. Fish, scuba. I'm thinking about going next week. Next week? [Birds chirping] I've never been to Hawaii. Me neither. - Sounds nice. - Yeah. Are you-- are you asking me to go to Hawaii with you? Yeah. [Soft music] Okay. Okay? Okay. [Shoes thudding] [steps rushing] - They match. - Absolutely not. - What? - No, no. - It's Hawaii. - Don't be that guy. What, should I pack my grass skirt? Point taken. Okay, you know, if you did have a coconut bra, though, I think I'd be interested in that. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Hm, no room. It was that or the edible panties. Good choice, because I get hungry on planes. - Hm. - Hm. - I get swamp ass. - [Chuckling] Yeah, we're going to beeline straight for the water, then. - Okay. - Yeah. Oh, hey, do you have any of those, um... - ...masky tubey things? - Masky tubey things? Snorkels? - Snorkels, yes! - Yeah, I think I got, um-- - Get new ones? - Let's get new ones. - Mm-hm. - Yeah, okay, cool. - Yeah, new ones. Okay. - Yeah. Let's get out of here, ready? - You ready? - Yes. Okay. Morning. [Claude] Good morning. I, uh... Going on a trip? Yeah. Uh, Hawaii. Uh, Detective McGee, this is, this is Kyra. Uh, Kyra this is, um, Detective McGee. He's handling, uh, uh, the case. [Kyra] Hi, nice to meet you. You got a minute? Okay, sure, yeah. Please. [Door creaking] [door slamming] How you been? [Chuckling] Fine. Never called. I've been taking your advice. Good. How's your hand? Better. Hm, taking a break. Hitting the bag, right? Right. Can I see it? - The bag, yeah. [Chuckling] - Yeah. Follow me. [Lock rattling] No gloves. Think I could get a glass of water? Yeah. How long you two been, uh? - Not long. - A few months. [Detective McGee] That's good. - Detective-- - Can I ask you where you were last night? Yeah, we went out to dinner and then a film. Where? High Misty and they were playing "Dirty Dancing" at the park. Anyone else with you? Yeah, my friends, the Rileys. Mitch, what is this all about? Found Logan Kirby's body last night. Shot twice in the chest. Seems like we weren't the only ones looking for him. [Suspenseful music] Weird thing was, though, it seemed like he was, I don't know, tortured. You know anything about that? No? How about you? No. Well, all that is what it is now. I mean, these types get themselves into all sorts of trouble. But murder, that's a different game. Lord knows I'd understand, but I got to ask. Did you murder Logan Kirby? [Suspenseful music] I wanted to. But I couldn't do it. [Suspenseful music] Have a good vacation. You okay? [Kyra sniffling] [Kyra crying] [Kira trembling] [dramatic music] [dramatic music]
