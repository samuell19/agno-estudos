Ever since men distrusted each other, which appears on the records as early as the Book of Genesis, there have been spies. Prying eyes taking note of enemy dispositions and hastening back with vital information. Until some time in the last century, they took on a certain glamour and became romantic figures of melodrama, or featured in the glorious absurdities of the early cinema. Alas for silent films. Alas for Guide and Phillips Oppenheim. The times have changed, and so have the methods. Today spying has grown almost into a minor industry, a cold reality of the Cold War helped by every modern device, every scientific aid that can be conjured up. The U-2 planes, radar, microscopes, microfilms, microphones, microdots, machines on which coded messages are recorded in morse symbols And automatically transmitted at such a high speed that the whole message is sent in a matter of seconds, making detection impossible. Now indeed they come not as single spies, but in battalions. Harry Goldman, Colonel Abel, Klaus Fuchs, the Rosenbergs. One case overlapping another in ever-widening circles, until every secret department is suspect and no carrier of secrets is safe unless he is also safe from blackmail. This is in all its basic essentials the true story of one group of such people. Gordon Arnold Lonsdale, Peter and Helen Kroger, Henry Houghton and Elizabeth Gee. - Give us another Scotch, Dimitri. A large one, as it's on the house. They don't have enough of these do's for my liking. Thanks. More champagne, please. - How you doing, Paula girl? Concentrating on the job, eh? What about relaxing with me tonight when it's all over? Hey, how about it? I'm talking to you, Paula! Ah! I'm terribly sorry, my fault. - What the devil is it, Warner? - An accident of some sort with the drinks, it looks like. - Not the Turkish ambassador's wife. Oh dear. - Is it Houghton again? - I'm afraid so, sir. Houghton! - Sir? - Report to my office at 0900 tomorrow. - Yes, sir. - Harry. Drinking? - Hm. Drowning the sorrows. - You have no sorrows, Harry. - Oh, don't you believe it, darling. I've picked up a packet of 'em today. A packet. Got kicked out of the embassy party. On me arse. Why? - Tipped the drinks over the Turkish ambassador's wife. What's the worst they can do? Send me back to England. - I'm sorry, drogi. - It's not your fault, ducks. You know... I'm going to miss... You. Here, I got a present for you. Picked it up on D-Day. There you are. - Thank you, Harry. - Okay, get 'em off. What's it matter anyway, what's it matter? When they machine-gunned us in the drink, I swore I'd never worry again if I ever got out of it. Well, I haven't, either. Fight for your country, risk your life, gratitude. In the Navy since I was 15. Could have worked my way up, but oh no, oh no. Highest you can get is Master-at-Arms. Haven't been to the right school. Not the officer type, old boy. What's it matter if you haven't got it? Money will buy it. Money will buy anything. Buy anything. - London, eh? - â€œYak. - You were drunk! - Sir- - Well anyway, you'd been drinking. You know as well as I do, Houghton, working in the embassy here you can't do that sort of thing. - It won't happen again, sir. - You're damn right it won't. I warned you the last time, if there was any repetition, you'd be for it. You'll be sent home on Tuesday. - Tuesday? - We'd never have been kept you here this long but for your war record. You're a bad security risk, Houghton. - Okay, sir, if that's it, that's it. - I'll have to make a report to the Admiralty about you. Maybe as a civil servant they can't fire you. But I don't see how they can possibly give you a job of any responsibility again. Christina darling, you will be surprised to learn that I have been posted to Portland, the most secret Admiralty base in the country. I miss you more than I can say. - Do you know much about the Underwater Weapons Establishment? - Not a thing. Whitehall shoved me out here. Been in Warsaw ever since I left the service. - Warsaw? Behind the Iron Curtain. Had to watch your step there, I'll bet. - Always watch it, don't worry. - Well, there's no choice here. All this new anti-submarine equipment and heavens knows what we're experiment with. They reckon this is is about the most hush-hush joint in the whole country. Probably why they sent you down here. - Could be. - Commander Winters has grabbed you for the Records Department. Told me to take you straight there. - Mr. Houghton's with you, is he? That's all right, sir. You appreciate the significance of all of this? Of course. - You can't get in there without a special pass. The whole underwater defence system of Britain is tied up in these few buildings, so you can understand them being a bit particular about it. I've saved our department till last. This is where you'll be working, Houghton. I'll introduce you to the boys and girls. We're a pretty happy bunch on the whole. Meadows. Meadows, this is Mr. Houghton. You'll be assisting Meadows. - How do you do? - How you do? - You're more than welcome. I badly need some help, I can tell you. I'm weeks behind with the filings, let alone anything else. - Oh, you'll soon get into the run of things. There's nothing particularly expert or complicated about the work we do here, I'm afraid. The main thing about it is quantity. Oh yes, this is Marjorie, Marjorie Shaw. - How do you do? - One of the more worthwhile reasons for working in this department. Runner-up for Miss Lyme Regis to boot. - Oh, I wish you'd forget that, Mr. Winters. It was four years ago. - Oh, what's it really? Well, apart from shorthand and typing, she generally lights up the place. Oh, Elizabeth, this is Mr. Houghton. Miss Gee. - Hello. - Mr. Houghton's the new recruit I told you about. Miss Gee is the guardian of our innermost secrets and the keeper of the keys. She also makes an excellent cup of tea. - I was just about to put the kettle on. Jolly good. This'll be your desk here. Come into the office for a moment. I've booked you in at the White Horse until you can make your own arrangements. Thanks, I've got a caravan at Portsmouth I'd like to bring over here as soon as I can find a site. - The one on the left is for old Meadows. We really must get some new cups. There's not one here that isn't chipped. - Mr. Houghton likes it strong. - Does he? Well, I'm afraid that's the best we can do on our ration. - The last cup of the week. - Oh, thanks, bright eyes. How about taking a cup of something stronger with me tonight, eh? - Mr. Houghton. Sugar? - Thanks. No, no, seriously. It gets damn lonely on weekends. - It'll be all right when you get to know a few people. - That's why I thought of making a start with you. Thanks, there's a concert down in Weymouth tonight. Do you go to concerts? - Sometimes. - Then why not? - Because I've got a date, really. - Couldn't you get out of it? - I'll give Mr. Meadows his. - You don't know my date. - Well, if you change your mind, give me a ring at Marslow Post Office, it's right by my caravan. I've got it all laid on. What is it, son? - You're wanted on the phone, sir. - Okay, I'll be right over. - Good evening, Mr. Houghton. - Good evening. Hello there. Is that Harry Houghton? - Yes, who's that? - I'm a friend of Christina's. You wrote to her a week or two back, I believe. - Yes, I did. - I have a message for you from her. Do you ever come up to London? - Well, I've only been down here for a week or two, but I suppose I could. Could you come next Sunday? - Is Christina in London, then? - She could be. I will meet you outside the Art Gallery in Suffolk Street. Do you know it? - NO, no, but I'll find it. At 2:30. So that I will recognise you, you will carry a copy of Punch, and I will ask you where to catch a 406 bus. You will answer, that's the one that goes to Epsom. Is that all clear? - Yes, I think so. How is Christina? - Oh, she is very well. Until Sunday, then. 2:30, goodbye. Excuse me, can you tell me where to catch the 406 bus? - That goes to Epsom, doesn't it? - Harry Houghton? I'm a friend of Christina's. She showed me your letter. - We got on very well together. She was always very helpful. - Let's walk around the gallery, there are very few people there at this time of the afternoon. You were able to help her too, I believe. - I did what I could. - In your letter you suggested you might be able to help again. - I said if I could find a way to save a little money. - By save I take it you mean earn? - How do I know who you are? - Yes, I wondered when you'd ask that. Do you recognise it? - Is Christina in London, then? - No, no, no, not at the moment. What department do you work in at Portland? - Records. Look, if you're thinking... Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but if it's what I believe, you're barking up the wrong tree. - I'm thinking you could help us. - I'm not interested, just not interested. When I left Warsaw, I started a clean page. - We have photostats of the earlier pages, Mr. Houghton. - So that's it, is it? - Look, we don't wish it to be. We'd prefer you to work with us. Come on, you're a sensible fellow. - Look, I'm only the dogsbody at this place, you know? All the secret stuff is kept in the safe. - I see. - Supposing I did get you a few tidbits now and again, that would be about all. - Tidbits are no use. Test pamphlets, photographs of ships, these things are practically public property nowadays. Excuse me. Could you tell me where the Hogarth pictures are? - Straight ahead, madam. The next room but one. Thank you. You simply must see them, they're really beautiful. - What we want is what goes in the safe, and for that we're willing to pay well. - Too bloody tricky. I'm not a safe-breaker. - Oh come now, there are more ways of getting things from a safe than breaking into it. - There's no easy way. And what do you mean, pay well? - Well, it isn't my department, but for the right information it could be anything. 500, 1000, I don't know. - Then how do I find out? - When you deliver the stuff, when else? Look, you will receive through the post 3 Hoover brochure. - A Hoover brochure? - Yes. When you get it, you will go to the Toby Jug. It's a public house at Tolworth. At 12:30, the first Sunday in the month. Will you remember that, the Toby Jug? - Hm, not likely to forget a pub. - It won't be me you'll be meeting, so carry a copy of Punch as you've done today. - Supposing I'm not lucky enough to get hold of anything at all? - That would be unfortunate. Anyway, you leave the gallery first. I am going to have a look at some Hogarths. - Houghton, be a good fellow and give this to Miss Gee to put in the safe, will you? - Very good, sir. Winters wants you to put this in the safe, Miss Gee. - I wonder how many times a day I open and shut that blessed safe. - Can I give you a hand with the tea? - Hm? Oh thanks, the cups are over there. - What sort of music do you go for, Miss Gee? - Oh, I don't know, I'd have to think, why? - I just wondered if you'd care to come to a concert with me some time. I haven't many friends around here, as you can guess. - No, I don't suppose you have. - I'm stuck up in that caravan night after night, well, life gets a bit humdrum. You wouldn't care to come and have a drink with me tonight in one of the local hostelries? - Oh, I'm sorry, but it's my badminton night, and, well, my friend Celia, she'll be expecting me. - Oh, that's good. - Work for you, my dear. My photos of the 128-8. They have to go with the file. Captain 8. Will be calling for them any time now. I know it's heresy in the Civil Service to suggest anything that might interrupt the making of tea, but these are top super-duper secret, my girl, and if I were you I'd shove them in tout de suite. - I was going to, don't worry. If you wouldn't mind making the tea then, Mr. Houghton? - No, no, carry on. - How are you settling down here? - I'm not grumbling. By the way, I've been meaning to mention, if ever you want any private photographs taken, I'm your man. Top-class prints, reasonable rates. I do them in my spare time. Most people fresh here like some. Well, let me know, won't you? - Where do you go to play badminton? - Just off the prom, near the pier. They're nice courts. - Can anybody come and watch, meaning me? - Of course. You'll probably put me off my game, though. You won't even notice I'm there. - How do you know? - Eight shillings, sir. - Right. Have one yourself, Squire. - Oh, thank you very much, sir. - Here we are, then. - Oh, oh not a double, not straight off, I'm not used to it. - It'll do you a power of good after all that exercise. Cheers. You looked pretty smart in that sports gear, I thought. - Oh, that's practically regulation. - Didn't look like regulation to me. - Well, I may have taken an inch or so off the shorts. - Yes, always take an inch or two off the regulations, that's what I say, whatever they may be. In our job we're surrounded by rules and regulations. I mean, intelligent people like ourselves, we use our common sense. I mean, those that are worth keeping, we keep. Those that aren't worth keeping, we ignore. - There's a lot in what you say, I suppose. - You bet there is. I was in the Navy too long not to have found that out. Come on, drink up, let me get you another. - Oh no, really, one of these will last me the whole evening. - Ah now, drink up, come on. - Do you know, Bunty, the place has changed for me this last week. - Has it? Shall I tell you something, Harry? - What's that? - Well, I don't know what made me think it, but I thought it was Marjorie Shaw you had your eyes on when you first came here. - What, are you kidding? If there's one type of woman I can't abide it's the wilting English rose. Give me a woman with some intelligence, some courage, some flesh on her. It wouldn't take anyone long to find out you'd been in the Navy. - It's the only place to broaden your mind. - Yours is broad enough. - Look, why not come up to my caravan tonight? I've got some records I'd like you to hear. - Oh yes, I seem to have heard that record before. - You know, that's the sort of comeback I like a woman to make. No, seriously, what do you say? - A fine reputation I'd get if I was seen. - Well, you won't be, it'll be dark. Besides, nobody knows you in that godforsaken place. Come on, we'll only be listening to the music, what's wrong with that? - It's not that I'm worried about. You know something, Bunty? You've rumbled old Harry Houghton. This is the humble home, and I mean humble. It won't be long before I get a house. I've got my eye on one an estate agent sent me. Two reception, modern kitchen, and a bathroom. All I need is the money. Can I go on in? - Yes, yes, yes, of course. I'll get you a drink. How do you feel about money, Bunty? - In what way? - I mean, do you ever think about it? - Of course I do, a lot. You can't do otherwise on what I earn. - Same with me. I hardly clear 11 pounds a week after tax. I don't know what you're getting, but I'll bet together we don't earn as much as a chap who sweeps up the factory floor. - I don't suppose we do, for that matter. - Here, let me get you another drink. And yet we're doing work of national importance, handling secrets worth millions. - Upon which the fate of the nation depends, if we're to believe what we're told. - Well, I wouldn't put it as high as that. But we're not being paid enough. Why not? Because we're suckers, just ordinary respectable white-collared suckers. - Well, I don't know about the respectable part. - Look at the people who get tonnes of money by doing nothing, just fiddling this and fiddling that. I did a bit when I was in Warsaw, black market. It's the only way that people like you and I can get a bit of capital together. - The trouble is you can't fiddle anything in our game. - Suppose we could, Bunty, what would you do with the money? - Hm? Oh, I don't know. Get a car, I expect. Sports two-seater, a yellow one. - Yeah, I'd get a car too, and a house. Anything else? - I've always been mad about stocks and shares. I've got some Aspro shares that have doubled themselves. - Go on. - Only 30. That won't get me far. But what I'd like is to have hundreds of different shares that I could buy and sell. Then off to Monte Carlo on the profits. - Yeah, well, let's face it, there's a fat chance of getting any of those things on the salary we earn. - I'd like to go to Monte Carlo. - Apart from pinching a file from the safe. - From the safe? - Yes, there are people who'd be interested in paying us a few thousand pounds for a look at one of those files for an hour or so. - You're not serious? - All we'd have to do is take it away Friday night, get it photographed, and bring it back Monday morning. - I'm going home. - Don't be an idiot, Bunty. You asked me a silly question, I gave you a silly answer. - Well, I hope so. Harry, they're national secrets, in my care. - I've told you, it was only a joke. - And a very stupid one too. Look, it's getting on for 11 anyway, I must go. - Oh, don't go, Bunty, stay a little while longer. - No, I can't, the last bus goes at 10 past. - All right, sweetheart, I'll see you to it, but what about meeting tomorrow, eh? - Well, I'm going to chapel in the morning. - Well, after chapel, then. Let's have lunch together, I'll meet you at the pier entrance. - All right. But we'd better go now. - Okay. A large Scotch, please. - Would you mind passing the water, please? Thanks. - That's four and six, sir, please. Thank you. - Sudden change in the weather this morning, eh? - Yes. - I suppose you wouldn't happen to know where I could... I was only gonna ask you if you knew where I could catch the 406 bus. There's a table over there. I'm Alex Johnson, how are you? - You American? - Canadian. But don't let that mistake you. In our game, you should know it's never what's expected. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Well, let's say you'd never expect an ex-Master-at-Arms in the British Navy to pay regular visits to 135 Poznerstrasse, Warsaw. But he did. - All right, I get it. - The little guy you met at the art gallery has passed you up the line until somewhere around the middle you reached me. From now on it's me you'll be dealing with. Drink up, have another. How have you got on? - I haven't. - Nothing? - Not a thing. And it's no damn good you threatening me, either. I'm not likely to do that. I know only too well this could be a long and tricky job. - Yes, you've said it. - Well, I'm here to help you. I've had a good deal of experience in this sort of thing. There's always some way, I've found. - There's a bloody good way, but the trouble is she won't play. - She? - Anyone occupying that chair? - No, no, no, carry on. Thanks. - Let's have that other drink somewhere else. Tell you what, let's catch that 406 bus. I should think she's known very few men intimately. - Well, I wouldn't be certain of that. - Well, you should know. But it stands to reason that a spinster of 38, if that's what her real age is, has some reason for remaining single. Either an unhappy love affair. - Well, she's never mentioned one. - Maybe she's unattractive to men. - She's not exactly that. - Maybe she hasn't been around much, had little opportunity. - Well, I'd say she'd led a sheltered life. - Well, that's what we must work on, then. Show her the town, let her see what she's missing, soften her up a bit. Do you think you could persuade her to come to London? - Oh yes, easily. - Fine, I'll lay on a suitable programme for next weekend. - Do you see what's going on over there? Oh. - Here, come sit down. Oh! Oh, down! - Have you ever been to a party like this before, Bunty? - Oh, never. It's marvellous. - Hey, hey, hey, what's the matter around here? Nobody drinking tonight? I'll have to arrest you. - I've done nothing but drink all night. - Scotch for you, Harry? - Thanks. - That's a very nice dress you've almost got on there, Miss Gee. - The things Alex says. How long have you known him, Harry? - Since I was in the Navy. He was in the American Navy. Still is, for that matter. - Really? - I suppose you're wondering how he can afford all this, eh? - Well, I was wondering. - He's an American Naval Attache at NATO. - Phew. That must be only important. - You bet it is. Oodles of dough. - Well, I like him. - I thought you would. - He's nice. You're nice too, Harry. - How do you like this sort of life, Bunty? - I love it. I absolutely adore it. You know, nothing like this has ever happened to me before. - Well, we must make sure that it goes on happening, mustn't we? - Mmm. - Eh? - Mmm. Eh? Here we are, this is the place. - Ooh, it does look nice. But we couldn't possibly afford anything like this. - Ha, don't you believe it. This is the drawing room. Nice big window. Sofa there, I thought, and my record player there. Kitchen's in there, this is the bedroom. - Oh. - I thought the bed there. Just the place for a six-foot-wide job. I like a big bed. - That's all you think about, that and your record player. - And you, I wouldn't be thinking of the bed otherwise, would I? - Harry. - Do you know what Alex said to me the other day? - No? - He said I was lucky to have found such a good-looking, intelligent woman. - You made that up. - No, no, no, straight. He's a very perceptive chap, is our Alex. Well, he has to be in his job. Has to keep an eye on all the other navies in NATO, see that they're holding nothing back. - How's he to know that? - Oh, there are ways and means. For instance, he asked me the other day if I could find out a bit about what was going on now and then. - How do you mean? - Well, you know, in general, anything I happen to hear or see, the odd document. - Harry. You said you were joking. - What about? - The other day, when you talked about the files. - But I hadn't seen Alex again then. This is different. - It isn't different. - Of course it is, he's American, he's on our side. He just wants to check that we're keeping our end of the bargain with NATO. - I don't believe it. How do you know he's not a Russian spy? - I knew him years back, when the British and American Navies were working together. - He could still be a Russian spy. - Oh, don't be silly, Bunty. Does he act like a Russian? Does he look like a Russian? Does he talk with a Russian accent? - That doesn't prove a thing. I tell you, I've known him for ages. - Look, it doesn't matter who he is. Everything in our office is secret. - It's a lot of bull, most of it. - Well, it may be bull to you, but it's not to me. I signed the Secrets Act, don't forget. And so did you. - That's bull too. Listen, Bunty, I'm not asking you to do anything. I wouldn't get you mixed up in anything, whatever it was. - What are you asking then? - Simply to leave the safe door open for a few minutes on Friday afternoon, and then go and powder your nose. - While you steal a file. - Borrow one for the weekend- - Oh my God. - And return it on Monday. You won't be involved in any way. - Oh, no. - I promise you you won't. I think too much of you, Bunty, you know that. I'm doing this for you as well, you know? To get this place and everything. Do you know how much Alex is gonna pay me? - I don't care. - 500 quid, 500 smackers, for borrowing a single file for the weekend. It could change our whole lives. - Harry, that shows how wrong it is. Nobody pays all that money for nothing. You don't know what you're doing to me. You don't know what you're asking. - Well, another week nearer my pension. Nice weekend, everybody. - Bunty, are you going to tidy up? You heard what I said, are you going to tidy up? There's not much time. I said there's not much time. - Going away for the weekend, Houghton? - Yes, sir. I was thinking of going to London. - Oh, good for you. How are you liking it here now? - Very well, thank you, sir. - Getting into the swim, eh? Well, have a good time. - Thanks very much. - Harry. - What are you doing here? I told you to keep out of this. - Marjorie's coming back. You're not gonna try and get it out like that? - It's clouding over outside. I hope it's not gonna mean coats this weekend. - I shouldn't think so. The weather looks pretty set. - I shall take mine anyway. I'm going up to Blandford to my aunt's. Bye bye, see you Monday. - Good night. - Do you think she noticed anything? - No. There shouldn't be anybody else. - Where are you going now? For God's sake, let's get out of here. If we leave last, they'll smell something. - Don't get it in a tizz. Did you lock up properly? - Of course I did. - Where's the key? - Oh. - Give that to me. It'll look odd if you're carrying it. - I don't see why. - They know it's mine. - I didn't mean to get you involved in this, Bunty, you know I didn't. - It's a bit late to think of that now. - Good evening. - Good luck with the pools tomorrow, Tim. - I can do with it, huh. Good night, Miss Gee. - Good night. - Good Right, Tat - Good night. Good night, miss. Good night. Do you mind telling me what you got there? - It's only laundry, towels. - Okay. - Good night, Taffy. - Good night, Miss Gee. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, hey, you two! Hello there. I was hoping I'd bump into you. - Why? - Remember those photographs I talked to you about? I thought if you were gonna be around Weymouth, this is the perfect weekend for them. - We shan't be in Weymouth for the weekend. - It was simply an idea. I thought with this weather, on the promenade or the beach. - I don't want any bloody photographs. We're in a hurry. - All right, don't be so damned uncivil about it. - You're a cool one. - Someone had to be. I Ah I - Second-hand, but it's a good buy. Or here's the new one. I've sold a dozen of them since Christmas, she's a beauty. 50 records, Sixpence a time, and a year's guarantee. You'll make a bomb, Max, you can't help yourself. Think it over, it's a cinch for the club, Max. Hello? - Hello, Alex? This is Harry Houghton. We're on our way up to town. - All right, what time does your train get in? It's due in at Waterloo at 2:50. Make it 3:15 then. Right, we'll see you at the tea shop. - Yeah. - Goodbye. - Bye. I've got you two tickets for the â€œCrazy Gang" show tonight. They're in my briefcase. When I get them out, we'll make the transfer. - When do we get the money? - There's 20 pounds with the tickets. - 20 pounds? - Yes, for expenses. - And when do we get the real money? - If it's any good, there'll be cash with the file when I give I back to you tomorrow. I suggest you open a bank account in London. I'll get the tickets now. You'll like the show, I've seen it twice. And afterwards I've booked you a table at the Mont D'Or. It's quiet but the food's good. Well, I'll be getting along now. I'll see you tomorrow at four. Have a good time. - He's funny. He's not a bit like he was last week. - Oh, business, duckie. When it comes to business, all Americans are the same. They take it too damn seriously. Come on, let's get out of this dump. Mind the doors. - Oh, hello, Gordon. - Hi, Helen. - Come on in. Peter's on the floor in the drawing room sorting books. He made a good buy at a sale and wants to take them up to the shop tomorrow. - I'll have to interrupt him for a bit, I'm afraid. He's come across. - Houghton? - Uh-huh. - Is it any good, Gordon? - As far as I can tell, yes. - Oh, it's you, Gordon. - Hello, Peter. It looks like the real McCoy to me. - It's Houghton, dear. - Really? - Yeah, I think he's come up with the goods. Anyways, there's a mess of it. Some of the stuff I've never seen before. - Ooh, plans too. You know, I'd arranged to go to Paris next week anyway. - There you are. Better. - Whatever it is, it seems pretty well documented. - We're getting more like Fort Knox every day. - All right. - Funny the neighbours don't get suspicious about those drawn curtains. - We have some very nice neighbours. - The English are great lovers of privacy and eccentricity. A man who buys and sells old books and bolts and bars his house at night, this is a man who is worthy of respect, not suspicion. - Ready when you are. - Result of test 347. Submarine. Formidable. Stage 16. Test 8974. Prototype C. Maximum detection. 200 miles. - Is that the lot? - That's it. Well, we just made it, one minute to go. - I'd better get going. Peter. - Coming. - There you are. - Thank you. Be careful. Have the chair. Okay. I'll be up soon. - Peter'|| be up in a moment. - Get through all right? - Yeah, fine. - All set. - Okay. Oh, Helen, you have a... Hold everything very steady. - All right? - To think of all the great books of the world reduced to a dot. A full stop. "The Iliad," â€œWar and Peace.â€œ Specks of dust. All right. - Chatting about that Charlie Naughton, you know, when he went, "Oh!" Well anyway, here's to us. I knew that'd make you laugh. - When will you take it over, Peter? - Tuesday. I'm on the 2:30 flight to Paris. - See if there's a letter from my wife, will you? - Of course. - Would you like a cup of tea, Gordon? - I'd rather have a Scotch if you've got one. - I think so. Tea for you, Peter? - Yes, please. - Okay. - It's all right, we're early. - Check these keys over, will you? 107, 303, 117, 148, 209, 88. All right? - Right. Morning. - Good morning. - Have a nice weekend? - Yes, thanks. Went up to London. - Must have been warm up there. - It was rather. We've only got 10 minutes, you know? Bags of time, it's only 8:15. - Hello, you two are early. - You too, sir. - Work piling up. I'm just going to the canteen for a cuppa. Fortify myself for the rigours of the day. - I told you we should have been earlier. Winters is later as a rule. Quick, give me the key. No, I'll do it, there's a knack. - Come on, come on, hurry up. There, it's back safe and sound and no harm done. - Until the next time. Must there be a next time, Harry? - You saw how much the cheque was for. Won't even buy me the house. - Me? - Well, us, then. Don't let's start arguing now. - Is Commander Winters here yet? - Yes, he's gone to the canteen. - All right, I'll see him there. The last poison pen case we had turned out to be the fellow's secretary. Remember that one, Winters? - Oh, yes, yes, promoted her to get her out of the way. The wages of sin. You've had nothing more than these three letters? No phone calls? - I'd have let 'em slide but for the accusation in today's letter. - Suggesting you do private photographic work in the government's time. Damn cheek. - Do you? - Not in the government's time. I do some portraits for friends and people around the place in my spare time. - Well, there's nothing wrong with that. - Well, I like doing it, keeps my hand in. - No idea who wrote these letters? - None. - Well, you know, I think we'll have to get the local CID in on this. And you'd better give me a list of likely suspects. Doris, could you get me Seachester CID? Mm-hmm. And don't make it too long a list 'cause it means putting chaps on the watch. - Well I really can't think of anybody much. There's a chap in Stores I had a brush with. Who else? Oh yes, that new fellow Houghton doesn't seem to like me. Blew his top when I suggested some pictures. Oh, and there was a girl in Admin. But that was months back. - It's always the same with local councillors. Puffed up little squirts who think themselves important, shouting their heads off as though the world revolved around them. You know, tin-pot little admirals in a bloody duckpond. - That's two pounds six and six with the last round, Mr. Houghton. - Right, you know, just ask them to do something like making up a road. - Order your last drinks, please, gentlemen! Will you come back to the house for a drink, Charlie? Not tonight, Harry, if it's all the same to you. We had a late night last night. You understand, be getting home, you know, to the wife. - Good night. - All right, good night. - What's that little drama in aid of, rape or shoplifting? - No, same as you've been covering, poison pen. - Oh, not the same case? - That's it. - Oh, I've been wasting my time again, as ever. - I didn't get much change at first. But when I produced the typewriter, she came out with it. Full confession. Oh, I don't know, I'm not a psychiatrist. Oh, jealousy, frustration. Anyway, Captain, it's up to you now. The ball's in your court. Yes, I've packed her off home with her mother. Right-oh. Well, that wraps that up. Leaves you free too, Anderson. - Yeah, a pity about that, sir. Quite a nice little pub-crawl. That fellow Houghton certainly patronises the best places. Spent 4 pounds 15 last night, all told. - Who, he did, or you? Oh no, he did. All I had was three pints. He certainly likes to splash it around a bit. Got a girlfriend in the establishment. She likes her nip too. Brand new Zodiac car, nice bungalow, well furnished, talking about a trip to Spain. I don't know how these people do it. - All on the h.p., I'll bet. You can get buried on it nowadays. Yeah, but you can't drink on it. You know, in the three days I've been following him, he's spent 10 pounds 14 and 6 pence in pubs alone. Where's it all come from? - You know, you've got a point there. Even if he's got the car and everything on h.p., he's still got to meet the instalments. What do you reckon he earns, 15-16 pounds a week? Well, we'll soon find out. Hello, get me Captain Ray again, would you? It wouldn't be more than 15 pounds a week in Records. - His girlfriend's in Records too, a Miss Gee. - All right, say 30 pounds a week all told, less tax. Oh hello. Hello, Redforn here again, Captain. Look, there's something I wanted to ask you. - Yes? - Gas company. Come to look at your stove. - What, now? - Didn't you get a notification from the company that your metre reading was greatly in excess of the normal? - Yes, I did. What's the meaning of it? - It means you've got a leak, mate. - I haven't smelled anything. - Ah, could be the metre. - Well, it's pretty inconvenient now, I'm just off to work. - Oh, well, I'll leave it then. I shouldn't leave it too long, though. You'll get a hefty gas bill. - All right, then. Perhaps you'd better do it, but be as quick as you can, will you? - Shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes. - Right. This way. There's a gas fire over there. There's one in the bedroom. And the stove's in there. - Nothing wrong with the stove. - That's number one. - This one's okay. I'll just check the one in the bedroom. Are you gonna be much longer? The fires are all right. Must be the metre. Oh yes, it's the metre all right. I can see that. We'll have to send you another one. Still, you drop them a line, eh? Don't let them charge you for extra gas. You bet I won't. - They will, given half a chance. - Pubs closed 20 minutes ago. - They don't keep very strict hours around here, I've noticed. - Well, we shall have to do something about that, shan't we? - Now hurry along, gentlemen, please. It's well after closing time. You'll get me pinched. - Well, see you next Wednesday, Charlie, then. - Right-oh, Harry. Good night. - Good night. - Are you sure you're all right to drive, Harry? What do you think? Is there any gin left? Don't you think you've had enough, Harry? Get the glasses, honey. What would you like, Trovatore? - Blasting gramophone's going to drown everything. - Well, I put the mike in a good position, sir. - Yes, for recording Verdi. - I've always liked that bit. You always play it so loud, Harry. - I'm with her there. I like to hear it. You just want it to be background for other things, don't you, eh? Why not? Oh, Harry. - Would you two like to leave? - I've watched operations at Guy's Hospital Without fainting. I can take it. - How about you, Sergeant? - I'm engaged, you know? - Seem as good a moment as any. Thank you. - Hand them around. - Here you go. Harry. Yes, dear? I think I'll buy a few more of those Aspro shares. Mmm, yes, I should, I should. Trouble is I can't afford more than about 50. Harry. - Yes? Don't you think you could ask Alex for more money? After all, it must be worth it. Worth a bloody fortune. - Ask him on Sunday, then. You said he said 1,000 last time, and all we got was 500. He must know the risk we're taking. It's lovely this time of morning. Looks like it's gonna be hot today. - I hope so, we could do with a bit of sun. - Car two, car two, this is car one. Suspect now half a mile outside Puddleton and ought to be reaching you in about five minutes time. Be ready to take over. Car one, this is car two standing by. Car two standing by. - Did you see who we just passed? - I suppose they have to go to market and things like that. - Don't let the bastards get too far ahead of you, Doris, or you'll have someone come between us. - I'm supposed to be an I driver, aren't I? - Looks like the end of the trail. - Ah, Derry & Toms, eh? - Meeting someone in the Records Department, maybe. - We'll split up here. I'll try and get as close to them as I can. You get on to headquarters for reinforcements. If there's a contact in there, we'll need plenty. - Right. - Where to, please? - The roof garden, please. - Soft furnishings, please. - Toy department, please. - And you, sir? - Eh? - Where to, sir? - Oh, roof gardens, please, miss. - How about going to a show tonight? Would you like that? - Oh yeah. - We're not in any hurry to get back, are we? That's pretty, isn't it? Look nice outside the bungalow. - I'll take your basket, you take mine. Meet you tomorrow afternoon at the Round Pond, Kensington Palace Gardens, four o'clock. - Hello, number nine calling from the roof gardens at the top of Derry & Toms store. Houghton and Gee have just contacted a tall well-built man wearing an American style suit. At this moment he is descending in the lift carrying a shopping basket. Houghton and Gee are still here, so I'll stay and keep tag on them. Over and out. - At last. - Ah. - I'm sorry, kids, didn't realise it was so late. Been waiting long? - Hours. - Oh, at least five minutes. - I've been shopping. You know how it is, Saturday, always crowded. Come on in. I was just about to pick the lock. - Help yourself to a drink. Johnnie, you know where they are. - Right. - I'll get dinner started. - Hey, what's the hurry? We're all right. - The vegetables, honey, five minutes. - Well, I'll help you. - What, a woman in my kitchen? No, thanks. - It's a good job my husband's away. He wouldn't have inquiry agents in the hotel. He's Roman Catholic, you know? Doesn't approve of divorce. What sort of woman are you watching for? - It's no affair of yours, madam. - Sorry, I was only trying to help. I see a lot of the comings and goings in this street. Don't disturb the bed. - We're not here to sleep, unfortunately. - That's all right, then. Mind you it'll cost you another pound if you do. What is it? Fourth floor, second on the right? - That's it. Still got all his lights on. - Harman calling, Harman calling. - Message received, out. Fred. Harman and George reporting they're in position. - Right. - That's all the cars back, all the personnel home. - Good. Have people at Great Portland Street Underground and the nearby change stations, that's... - Baker Street, Oxford Circus- - Well, have them there until the last train tonight, starting again first thing in the morning. - Right. - You got enough bods to cope with all that? - Be a bit of a squeeze with all the cars, but we'll manage. - Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid now it's just a question of waiting. - Oh. - Ooh. - Okay, kids, that's definitely the last one. It's half past one. - Oh, what's time at weekends, anyway? - Got to go down to Maidstone first thing in the morning to see a guy about a jukebox. - Ooh, you and your jukeboxes. - Sorry, honey, but it's a living. - Well, Ella and I have got to go anyway. We have a 20-mile drive. - Look, I hate breaking it up, but you know how it is. - We know when we're not wanted. Ella. - Oh. - Come on, get your things. - You dropping Anita off? - Yes, of course, I can- - Oh no, please, don't bother. I mean, it's way off your track, I'll get a taxi. Good night, Alex. - Good night, Alex, and thanks for the dinner. - Yes, thank you, it was a lovely evening. - All right, come again. - Bye bye. - Oh! You two go on, I've left my gloves behind. - Voila, my love. I picked them up. - Thanks. - Ciao. - I'm gonna plant a row of broad beans this morning. I've had it. So have you, Len boy. Here, Len. Len, it's him. Get on to headquarters. 7:43 the first train, mate. - But I thought that half past- - Sunday service. - He's on his way back from the underground. - Looks as though he's going to his car. Warn car number one to stand by. - Ere, I wonder how many more News of the World we're gonna get today? - Good morning, Helen. - Good morning, Gordon. - Is Peter up? - Of course, he never sleeps late. Oh, Gordon, you're early. - I forgot the underground doesn't open till later on Sunday so I came by car. - Where did you leave the car? - Miles away. Don't worry, off the main road. - You took a chance. - What, at this hour, on a Sunday morning? - You're tired, Gordon. - Yeah, I had a late night. Later than I expected. - There's at least three good sets of prints here. - You're right, there are. - Better get them down to the photographer as quick as you can. - Right. - I'd like a yacht. - Like Onassis? - No, just a little one, four berths. So we could invite a couple of friends and sail around the Isle of Wight and places. - Well, we might manage one if I can get Alex to raise the ante. - You are going to ask him, aren't you, Harry? - You bet I am, we're doing a job they can afford to pay for. And they're going to. - Woops, careful. Hello, you two. Good afternoon, Alex. - It's a bit crowded around here. Let's take a stroll. - To be on the safe side I'd like to skip a week. On the second weekend, that'll be the 17th, I'd like you to drive down to Winchester and come up from there by train. I'll meet you at the usual place in Waterloo Road. Your train leaves Winchester at 10:47. - There's one thing I'd like to bring up with you, Alex. - Oh? It's about the money, we're not fools, you know? - The fingerprints on the bottle belong to Helen Kroger, wife of Peter Kroger. In 1953, they got out of the United States where they were known as Morris and Lorna Cohen. American citizens. The FBI were after them, which is how we came to have their fingerprints. Now Lonsdale, alias our friend Alex Johnson, is I fancy a much bigger fish. Now the Canadian Police sent to Cobalt to check his birth certificate. The real Lonsdale left Canada at the age of eight with his mother. They returned to Finland in 1931. Maybe at 18 he fought in the Finnish war against Russia. Anyway, he disappeared. The Russians kept his papers. - Then handed them to our Lonsdale. - He arrived in Vancouver in 1953, probably from a Russian ship, and then came over here. - Do you think there's anyone else in this little party? - Probably an embassy contact, there usually is, but it might take months to find out who. - Croft wants to arrest the five of them as soon as possible. - It's the risk of a leak that I'm worried about. - When do you suggest, then? - Whenever they make their next move. - Roger and out, AB. They've left their car at Winchester and caught the 9:32. Nash and Armstrong are on the train. - That gives us roughly a couple of hours if they're coming in to Waterloo. Find out what time the train gets in, will you? Yes, sir. - And I'll get the shock troops to the Waterloo area. - Got enough? - Each other I could muster. - All right, I'll have a look at them. - Do you remember what you said in the Black Bull a few weeks back? About little people who think themselves important? - Did I? - Well, we're little people, but we are important, aren't we? - You're important to me, love. - No, I wasn't thinking of that or the money. That's all right now. - It's better. - No, it's not that, it's, well, you know, all the people we meet every day who think we're just a couple of dreary little clerks, when really we're nothing of the sort. I mean, we're VIPs, aren't we? I mean, we are, aren't we, Harry? Think of what we must mean to America. - To who? - America. You know, when all this is over, I think I shall apply for American citizenship. - Something to brighten the lives of those doomed to work on a Saturday morning. There's a tremendous kerfuffle in the upper dovecots, being going on all night, apparently. - I thought there was more activity than usual, what is it? - Well, rumour has it there's about to be a round-up of a batch of top-echelon Russian agents. - What, here, in London? - I don't know. Simon Dryden says it's an Admiralty affair, Underwater Establishment. - Oh my God, they haven't got in there? - It looks like it. Well, they may not have done much damage. Perhaps they caught up with them before they got a look at the goods. - Hello? - Hello. Is that the Russian Embassy? - Yes, sir. - May I speak to Mr. Routkevich, please? - Who is that? - It's a friend of his. I am sorry but Mr. Routkevich has gone to the Lords to watch the cricket. - Lords? Bloody marvellous. - Pardon, sir? - Oh, no, it's nothing. - Well played, sir. - There's a chappie over there talking to Routkevich. - Good luck, old man. - I'd better not look. - Unnecessary, I know him. Fellow called Blake. Minor cog in the Middle East department. - Really? - Positive. - I don't know how you remember all these names and faces, Charlie. - Only reason I was ever employed in intelligence, no other. - Think we'd better go now? - In the middle of the over? - No. Hopkins here. They've just come through the barrier. - Okay, thanks. - That's us. - Tonnes of time. - Now the more you put down, the more you pick up, you earn more off me... - The old Crown and Anchor, eh? - Oh no you don't, Harry. You're not chucking money away on that. - How do you know I'm chucking it away? It might be my lucky day. - Harry. - Are you all done? Right, here we go. There you are, three lovely hearts, three lovely hearts, pay the difference on three lovely hearts over here. - Hello, you two. - Hello. - Hello, Alex. It's Scotland Yard for you, my lad. - Harry, help me. - Come on, you. - What? - Come on. What's all this about? Gordon Lonsdale, you are clearly a professional spy, and must accept the consequences. You will go to prison for 25 years. Peter Kroger and Helen Kroger, 20 years. Harry Houghton, 15 years. Elizabeth Gee, 15 years. But there are still more in our midst, looking and acting like ordinary citizens. Who knows, there may be a spy, willing or unwilling, in this very theatre, perhaps in the very row where you are sitting. Another link in the same unending chain. As one cell is closed, another opens, and so the dark business of espionage goes on and on.
