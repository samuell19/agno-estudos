Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! What's wrong, Philip? Another nightmare? No! There's something under the sheets. For real this time! Look! Let's have a look at it then. See? How many times have I told you? It's just your imagination. Now go to sleep, it's late. No, don't go! Hold on. My grandmother gave this to me when I was a little girl. Now, every time you're scared, hold it, say a little prayer, and everything will go away. Are you sure? Absolutely. Now go to sleep. One... Two... Three. Goodnight. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Philip! My love! It's still here! It's alright! - It's in the shadows! - Shh... It's still moving! It's going to Isidore! - There's nothing there. - Mummy! Mummy! We've woken her up. - Go on, to bed. - Mummy! Coming, Isidore! Here she is! You see? She's fine! What's happening, Mummy? Nothing. Philip just wanted to say goodnight. Go on, to bed! Can I sleep with you? There it is! It's over there! Philip, that's enough now! Go on, everyone in the big bed! Yay! Isidore! Isidore! Isidore! Eight... Nine... Ten. Ready or not, here I come! Are you cold? No. Isidore's watching us from heaven and she wants us to be happy, doesn't she? I had a dream about her two nights ago. She was holding Piggy and waving at me. Ah! Have you found anything new? Oh-ho! Michael the Archangel! A true warrior. Just like you. Poor Piggy. Who knows where he's gone. He's with her! Did he beat this monster? This wasn't just any old monster. This was a truly powerful monster. Now. Keep it. Thank you! Right... You're right. He's up there, keeping her company. - Mum? - Mm-hmm. I'm scared that bad thing will come back. It won't. I promise. What are we going to do now? I know. Let's pray! Okay? - Yeah! - Come on then! Now sleep. Lights off? Sweet dreams, my love. One... Two... Three. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Hi, honey! How are you? I'm looking forward to later. How was your practice? Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us, for ever and ever. Amen. Amen. I'm not sure yet, but I think so. I like her and... Honestly she's the best thing that could have happened to me right now. Nothing happens by chance. Do you know what word never appears in the Bible? No... No, no one's hired me to correct that yet. Fate. The concept of fate is not part of the Christian religion, and destiny... doesn't exist, except in our vocation to give and receive love. Something you deserve more than anything. I'm really happy with her. We've got so much in common. She's funny... And she's always smiling... She even likes classical music! What's her name? - Catherine. - Ah... From the Greek, Katharos. Just let yourself go. Don't overthink things. Open up your eyes, and open yourself up to life! Your mother would be so pleased. My mother would be celebrating! Have you started to sort through her things to... No, not yet. But I will... I will. Well... If you need me, you know what to do. Thank you. The most absurd part of it all was his reaction after I played it. What did he say? "Capriccio No. 24, Miss Gray... "How dare you think you could tackle the absolute master, "the virtuoso! "Shame on you! You barely know how to hold the violin!" After that you'd think he would have left, but no. He just stood there, staring at me! And like Paganini himself, you shouted back: "Catherine Gray does not fail!" Did you know... Paganini was stick thin, toothless, and his fingertips were covered in scars from all those years of practice. He wasn't much to look at, but he was really popular, especially with the ladies. He was a true star. That's what they say... All I know is that I wouldn't go to those extremes just to be like him. I like my hands too much! Cherry or apricot? Cherry or apricot? Cherry or apricot? Sorry. Don't worry. Which do you prefer? I can't decide. Both! Excellent choice! You know they're homemade! What time's your class? Three. Do you want me to come with you? No. Are you sure? Yes! I can take care of myself. No! Hey. Are you okay? It's alright. It's alright. Hey... Hey, how are you? Yeah, I just got in. There was a bit of traffic. Hey, don't worry about it, okay? The doctor said so himself, it was just stress. Okay. You get some rest. I'll speak to you later. Bye. It's okay. C'mon. - Okay. - Okay. - Don't let me walk into... - No. No. Stop. Stop. - Ta-dah! - Surprise! Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday, dear Philip... Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday! Oh! Wait, wait! Photo time! Okay. Get closer, get closer! No battery! Get mine, it's on my desk. Okay! Be right back! Don't cut it without me! Who made the cake? He wants to know who made the cake! I did! He just doesn't believe me! I had a word with Father Earnest. Everything's going to charity. - Everything! That's great! - Uh-huh. You know, Catherine could give it a go. Here I am! Did someone say my name? We were just complimenting you on your culinary expertise. Very funny, Father! Are we taking this photo? First... a surprise! Ta-dah! Where did you find that? It's a secret. It's a secret between me and him! What?! These things happen! What things? You know... People find things that they thought they'd lost years ago. Okay, um... Did she tell you where she found it? In the storage closet. Look, I want to believe that this is a fluke. Philip, can we... can we just examine the signs? The rosary... unwinds itself and you find it on the floor. Next, your sister's teddy bear... long-lost, forgotten... mysteriously and inexplicably reappears. The most cunning trick of the devil is to try and convince one he doesn't exist. But the one thing the devil has never learned to do, and that is to hide his tail! Ominously, I think you and I have seen his tail. - I'm telling you, nothing strange is going on! I'm sorry, but I won't allow the past to ruin the present. At least pray. The power of prayer is the strongest weapon we have against all evil. Is everything okay? Sure. Sure? You know I can tell when your mind drifts off. Philip, I'm serious. What's wrong? It's nothing. You're thinking about Piggy, aren't you? I told you, I just found him! It's just that... My mother and I looked everywhere for that, for years, and never found it. It was my sister's. So... Aren't you happy we found him now? Yeah, of course. Of course. So I did have one idea... Okay. I'll be... Wait, wait, wait! I'll be the director, and you be the star! - Are you ready? - No. "Catherine at the Beach." Take one. Three, two, one, Action! Is this okay? You gotta keep going! My head's spinning! My head's spinning! Catherine? Catherine? Catherine? Catherine! Where is she? She's in Isidore's room. Don't come in. Catherine? In the name of God, look at me. Philip! Go away! Don't hurt her! Help me! If you want to save her, do not be deceived! Hold her down! Help me... Et Spiritus Sancti... In nómine Patris, et Fílii, et Spíritus Sancti. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, strengthened by the intercession of the immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of God, of blessed Michael the Archangel, of the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul and all the Saints, we confidently undertake to repulse the attacks and deceits of the devil. Let the Lord God arise, and let His enemies be scattered and let those that hate Him flee from before His face. As the smoke vanishes, so let them vanish away: as the wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of the Lord. Behold the cross of the Lord! I cast you out, unclean spirit, along with every satanic power of the enemy! I'm not going anywhere, fucking priest! Unclean spirit be gone! Whoever you are, along with all your companions who possess this servant of God! This girl is mine! You know that, Philip? Did you go to confession after you fucked her? By the mysteries of the Incarnation, the Sufferings and Death, the Resurrection, and the Ascension of Our Lord Jesus Christ... by the sending of the Holy Spirit; and the Coming of Our Lord unto the Last Judgment, I command you: Tell me, with some sign, your name, the day, the time of your damnation! I am everything! I am chaos, temptation, destruction, damnation! I am the poison of your miserable existences! I... Am... The Almighty! Unclean spirit, retire! Satan be gone! Leave this woman! In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit! The Word made Flesh commands you. Jesus of Nazareth commands you... Come on. Pray, Philip! Say all those little prayers you know, every last one! Especially the ones that whore of a mother taught you! Everyone knew her in Church! Men knew her really well. While you were reading your precious prayer cards, your mummy was busy getting fucked in the sacristy! Hello? Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hello? Am I disturbing you? No. Are you okay? Yes? Uh... Yeah. Yeah. Did you need something? Yes. Do you have any salt? Sure. Hold on a minute. Here. Thanks. Goodnight, and enjoy your dinner. Goodnight. Bye. I don't know how this could have happened. It looks as though someone's having a joke! Father! No, no, no. Please, don't get me wrong. It's just... Look, has anybody else been here? No! Yes. What?! Well she didn't come in. She lives upstairs. What did she want? She needed salt. First things first. Let's just... put this back where it belongs. Let's pray. Our Father, who art in heaven... Hello? Hello? Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. I'm sorry! I knocked, but... but the door was already open. I think it's broken. That's not possible. Try if you want... See? It opens. Don't worry. It's probably just some stupid problem with the lock. Nothing major. A locksmith can fix it. Are you okay? Yeah... Yeah... Okay, sit down. Stay like that for about twenty minutes and then put some cream on it. Do you have any? Yeah, I think I've got some somewhere. I should go. If you need anything at all, just give me a shout. Or pray, if you prefer. Her name is Sonia. I've seen her a couple of times now. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. She made these. They're her specialty. Try one. Philip... You... you rang me, distraught. All the bells were ringing, you said. Was this perhaps not the wind blowing them? Maybe. No. All the windows and doors were closed. Okay... And what about the... the creature that was following you? Nothing? Your imagination? Look, is this key my imagination? You really don't know what this key opens? I've no idea! You know, she didn't have to make these. She's actually quite a nice person. Yes, I'm sure she is. Would you like me to look after this? No, I'll hold on to it. Okay. Wait, what now? I really don't know. But since you ask... For both your sakes, I think you shouldn't see Sonia again. "He approached her "as he inhaled the smell of her jet black hair. "She was beautiful, with thin lips and perfect almond eyes." Hi, Sonia! Hi, Philip! How are you? I'm okay. How's your back? Better, thanks! Did you put some cream on it? Yeah, I did! Okay. I was just checking out the new lock. So, problem solved? Yeah. Um, I don't... I was just about to have dinner. I don't know if you fancied joining me? Yeah. Sure. Why not? Yeah? Okay. But I'm cooking! Okay. See you later! See you in a minute! Spaghetti with tomatoes. It looks amazing! I hope you like it. And a little wine... Oh... Please. It's my favorite. Let's toast. - Cheers! - No. You've got to look me into my eyes, or it's no sex for seven years. Cheers! Cheers. Oh my God, this is amazing! Do you like it? It's really good! Did you invent this? More or less. What does that mean? It's more of a personal reinterpretation. Have some more wine. Cheers! Music! What do you listen to? Chopin? This is so old! Ooh. I like it! Dance with me. Oh no, I can't dance. I really can't dance. Please... dance with me. No. You wouldn't want me to dance, I'm not very good at it. Dance with me. And you... What do you do? Uh... I'm a proofreader. Cool! You must read a lot then. Yeah. I just read and correct. Me, too. I usually read in my spare time. I like the classics. I like Italian writers. Maybe you know them. Such as Pirandello, Moravia, Svevo. Do you know them? Yes. Have some more wine. You need to loosen up. Do you have anything sweet? I think I might have something. Nothing homemade though. What do you have? Here we go. It's a strawberry cheesecake. Wow. I swear, it's my favorite. Really? Yeah! But with that, we need some shots. Yes... Sonia? Sonia, if that's you... can you tell me, alright? Yes. It's right there.. You see it? It's everywhere. It's looking at me. It's coming towards me. You see? It's like the night. It smells like wet earth. I'm cold! It's coming back! Who are you? Shh! Listen. We are relics, like screams in the silence. It's fear. It's fear, Philip! No, no, no, no, no! Are you okay? Will you talk to me?! Just leave me alone! Leave me alone, you won't understand! Philip! Philip, stop! What are you talking about?! What am I talking about? I'm talking about the demon that has kept me prisoner in this place for the last two years! About how it's been tormenting me most of my life! There was an old woman in my room just now! She just appeared out of thin air! An old woman just appeared out of thin air now?! Yes! Philip! You're scaring me! I'm scared! I'm... You have... to calm down now. Okay? Do you believe in the devil? I don't know. I've never been very religious. I'm not talking about religion, or even evil in the abstract sense, but the devil in the flesh. A real being that haunts you every second, of every day of your life. It's been tormenting me since I was a child. You're scaring me. I also used to be terrified. My mother's prayers were the only thing that could keep it away. It was as if her prayers squashed it... Like they pushed him away. And then it... killed my sister Isidore. She had just turned seven. We got through that period together. We gave each other strength. I never knew my father so... it was thanks to her that I even had a normal childhood, like every other kid. We laughed, we played, and, most of all, we prayed. Father Andrew told us that our prayers would protect us more than anything else, and he was right. That... creature didn't return for a very long time. Then, my mother passed away and I was left alone. It was Catherine that gave me the strength to get through that. We met by chance a few months earlier. She was a violinist. I loved Chopin and she adored Paganini. I suppose we didn't see eye to eye on music but... We fell in love. I really believed that I could have started a new life with her. And then... And then that thing... Returned and took her away, possessed her. Her body and her soul. It just all happened so suddenly, or maybe I was just blinded by love... Father Andrew knew immediately that she had to be freed. But the exorcism failed. Since then I've locked myself in here. She may not be here anymore, but I still believe that my mother is watching over me in this house. Do you think this thing, this presence, is still after you? Yes, he's always here. If you don't feel safe, you could sleep at my place. Believe it or not, I only feel safe here. Come with me. Come with me. Come with me. Come with me. Catherine? No! No, wait! Death and Destruction are never satisfied. You're not real! Death and Destruction are never satisfied! No, wait! Okay. How about now? Okay... ready. "Catherine at the Beach..." Three, two, one... Action! Is this okay? Great! My head's spinning! Smile for the camera. Smile for the camera. Father? Father? Hello? Do you like my drawing?! Do you like my drawing?! Catherine... Save me. Save me. No! Father? What are you doing here? What's that... knife in your hand? It's not what we thought. He's managed to get in. We have to stop him once and for all! Whose blood it that, Philip? What blood? That blood on the knife, Philip! No. It's... It's not... It's from the cake that me and Sonia had. Where is Sonia? I don't know! What does that have to do with anything?! Did you hear me? He's managed to get in! Oh my God! There is no demon, Philip! Are you crazy! What about everything that's happened until now? And what exactly has happened up until now, Philip?! The attacks! Catherine! What does this key open, Philip? I don't know! Where is Sonia? I told you, I don't know!! When you last showed me this key, Philip, I really began to think that you understood exactly what you had done. I was wrong. You know exactly what this key opens. You've given it to me once before... Just after you killed Catherine. You strangled her and hid her body in the cupboard, then you gave me the key. May God forgive me for having covered for you. We both saw her die that day! That day never happened, Philip! You have a sickness! Your mother has been treating you ever since you were a little boy. I was aware of it, and when she died and you started having these... visions again, I made it my mission to look after you. I failed. Now, see for yourself where Sonia is. Are you okay, Philip? Just leave me alone. We'll find someone who can give you the help you need. None of this is your fault, Philip. It's the sickness that drove you to it. You are not crazy, Philip, but the priest is right. Be quiet! There is no demon outside of yourself. Accept it! Ignore him! Kill him! No, I can't do it. I can't do it. Get out! Calm down. We'll find a solution! Liar! He'll have you locked away again. This time forever! Kill him! Be quiet! Philip, calm down. Put the knife down. Don't do it, Philip! Aren't you tired of all this? First, your mother, and now him! They repressed you, stuffed you with prayers and drugs, and stupid superstition. You are so much more than this! Free yourself! I can't do it. I can't do it. I won't do it! Get out! Get out! Calm down! I cannot go and you cannot keep fearing me. Accept your true nature. Don't you want to finally live? Philip, listen to me! Pull yourself together! You're right. You're right. There is no demon. There is no demon. I'm sorry, Father, but I deserve so much more. I deserve to be free. Now you truly are... what you are! It's coming back! Death and Destruction are never satisfied! My grandmother gave this to me when I was a little girl. Now, every time you're scared, hold it, say a little prayer, and everything will go away. The most cunning trick of the devil is to try and convince you that he doesn't exist. But the one thing the devil has never learned to do is to hide his tail. Michael the Archangel... A true warrior! Just like you. One... Two... Three. I tried to resist, but I can't go on without your help. Don't be afraid. I'm evil! I've killed people! He's deceived you. You are none of those things. He knows this and it is why he fears you. Who am I? Please tell me, I'm begging you! Philip, you know who you are. Trust yourself. I will always be with you. I miss you. You're mine, Philip! Don't think you've won! You're far too weak, you're nothing! You didn't take me, and you won't take her either! Our Father, Let go! who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. Whoever you are I cast you out! Now and forever, in the name of Jesus Christ, be gone! Be gone! Be gone. Philip... Philip... Philip.... Philip! Philip... Then there was war in heaven... Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. See you downstairs? Okay. Hey. I love you. I love you, too. Don't be long! Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry! Please, don't worry about it! You just moving in? Yeah! I'm moving into the apartment upstairs! I'm Sonia! Philip.
