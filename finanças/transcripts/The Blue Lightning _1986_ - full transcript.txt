- MCINALLY, YOU SADISTIC BASTARD! - QUENTIN, MY BOY, TRY TO HAVE A LITTLE DIGNITY. - DIGNITY? THE DAMN DINGOES WILL EAT ME ALIVE. - WELL, THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT, YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO BETRAY ME. - YOU BETRAYED ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO TRUSTED YOU. - IF YOU'RE GONNA GO ON AND ON ABOUT IT, QUENTIN, I SEE NO POINT. - THE POINT IS I'M GONNA DIE UP HERE. - THAT WAS MY INTENT, LAD-IE. MR. WORDS. - YES. - COME ALONG, MR. WORDS. - MR. MCINALLY, I THINK MAYBE IT IS A BIT MUCH. I MEAN, ALL THOSE WILD DOGS. - GO ON. - WELL, IT'S A TERRIBLE, CRUEL WAY TO DIE, SIR. - INDEED. YOU SEE IT THAT WAY, DO YOU, MR. WORDS? - YES, SIR, I DO. - OH, WELL, THEN.... QUENTIN, MR. WORDS HAS SUGGESTED-- AND I DO AGREE WITH HIM-- I OUGHT TO BE MERCIFUL, BUT LORD KNOWS WHY. - QUENTIN? - THERE YOU ARE, MR. WORDS. WE'VE SAVED HIM FROM THE DINGOES. - MR. WINGATE? MR. WINGATE? ARE YOU HERE, MR. WINGATE? - YOU DO NOT BOARD TILL YOU GET PERMISSION TO COME ABOARD. - YES, SIR, MR. WINGATE. YES, SIR. IT IS ME, TINKER LEONE. ONLY JUST ME. ALONE. I. - WANT PERMISSION TO COME ABOARD? - OH, NO, NO, SIR. NO, SIR. I CAN SAY IT RIGHT FROM HERE. - THEN SAY IT. - MY EMPLOYER, MR. CATHCART SENDS HIS HUMBLE REGARDS. - THE HELL HE DOES. - AND ASKS THE PLEASURE OF A VISIT FROM YOU AT HIS OFFICES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. - YOU TELL CATHCART IF HE WANTS TO SEE ME TO COME ON DOWN TO SAUSALITO HIMSELF. - OH, REGRET-LY TO SAY THAT MR. CATHCART CANNOT DO THAT. HIS SLIP DISC, OH, IS BOTHERING HIM SOMETHING FIERCE. - IS THAT A FACT? - YES, HE'S IN GREAT PAIN, MR. HARRY. GREAT PAIN. - GREAT PAIN. - GREAT PAIN. SO WHAT SHALL I TELL MY EMPLOYER THEN? - TELL HIM I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I FINISH LESSON NUMBER NINE. - YES, SIR. - IT'S REALLY HURTING YOU, ISN'T IT? - IT'S EXCRUCIATING, HARRY. YEAH, I CAN HARDLY MOVE. OTHERWISE, I'D HAVE COME TO YOU. I KNOW HOW YOU HATE TO LEAVE YOUR BOAT. - YEAH, WELL, BEFORE THEY PACK YOU OFF TO THE HOSPITAL, MAYBE YOU BETTER TELL ME YOUR PROBLEM. - WELL, YOUR PROBLEM IS A MAN NAMED LESTER MCINALLY. - YOUR PROBLEM, BRUTUS. - I CAN MAKE IT YOUR PROBLEM, HARRY. - OH, YEAH, AND IT'LL ALWAYS COST YOU. - IT ALREADY HAS COST ME. 400,000 BUCKS. - IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. MCINALLY--WHAT'S HE DO? - LESTER MCINALLY LIVES IN AUSTRALIA IN THE OUTBACK IN A TOWN CALLED OPAL RIDGE, WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE PREMIERE BLACK OPAL MINING TOWNS IN THE WORLD. - I'VE HEARD OF IT. - COURSE YOU HAVE. I'VE BEEN RETAILING OPALS OUT OF THERE FOR YEARS. THE MINES HAVE PRACTICALLY PLAYED OUT NOW. BUT THREE YEARS AGO, LESTER MCINALLY, WHO'D ONLY BEEN WORKING THERE THAT LONG, FOUND AN OPAL, A WORLD-CLASS DEEP BLUE BLOODY WONDER OF AN OPAL, ABOUT 35 KARATS WITH A FLASH OF WHITE DOWN THE MIDDLE AND ZIGZAGGING LIKE A STREAK OF SUMMER LIGHTNING. LESTER MCINALLY CALLED IT THE BLUE LIGHTNING AND PUT A PRICE ON IT OF 250,000. - GOD. BRUTUS, HOW CAN YOU SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR A PIECE OF ROCK? - HOW COULD I NOT? MY MAN IN SYDNEY, QUENTIN MCQUEEN, SENT ME PHOTOGRAPHS OF IT, AND, DEAR GOD, HARRY, IT LITERALLY GLOWED. NO, I KNOW. I CAN'T EXPECT YOU TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW COULD YOU? YOU'RE NOT OF THE FRATERNITY, BUT ONCE YOU ARE HOOKED, HARRY MY BOY, YOU ARE IRREVOCABLY AND IRRETRIEVABLY COMMITTED. - YOU'RE IN THIS THING FOR $400,000, AND YOU STILL DON'T GOT AN OPAL. - BECAUSE HE KEEPS UPPING THE PRICE, AND I KEEP MEETING IT BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF A KIND. IT'S PROBABLY THE LAST OF THE GREAT OPALS. THAT'S NO EXAGGERATION, HARRY. I MEAN IT. IT'S THE LAST OF THE GREAT OPALS, AND I MUST HAVE IT. - SO TELL ME. WHAT'S THE PRICE UP TO NOW? - 1/2 MILLION. NOW, I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN THERE, AND I WANT YOU TO GET MY MONEY BACK OR GET THE OPAL OR KILL HIM! PLEASE KILL HIM, THE BLOODY, LYING, CHEATING--KILL HIM. - THAT'S THE QUICKEST RECOVERY FROM A SLIP DISK I'VE EVER SEEN. - HE'LL KILL YOU IF HE CAN. HE'S I.R.A., A BOMBER. HE'S HIDING DOWN THERE FROM THE BRITISH. HE'S KILLED 56 PEOPLE IN LONDON WITH HIS BOMBS, AND HE'LL KILL YOU IN A MINUTE WHEN HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE AFTER. NOW, HE RUNS THAT TOWN OF OPAL RIDGE WITH AN IRON FIST. WHEN YOU GO IN THERE, YOU BETTER TO READY TO KILL OR BE KILLED. - I MUST ADMIT YOU'RE NOT USUALLY SO CANDID. I CAN ASSURE YOU OF SOMETHING, MY FRIEND. IF I TAKE THIS ON, IT'S GONNA COST YOU. - 75,000 PLUS EXPENSES. - 100,000 PLUS EXPENSES AGAINST 25% OF THE TRUE VALUE OF THE OPAL, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. - NO WAY. ABSOLUTELY NO WAY. - THANKS FOR THE CHAMPAGNE, BRUTUS. - OH, ALL RIGHT, $80,000 AND NOT A PENNY MORE. - TAKE CARE OF YOUR BACK. - BE REASONABLE, HARRY. I'M NOT A RICH MAN. 85,000. - SEE YOU, BRUTUS. - OH, HARRY, FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE, AS A FRIEND. - YOU HENNESSEY? - COULD BE. YOU THE AMERICAN BLOKE? - COULD BE. - 44 MAGNUM, HEAVY ENOUGH FOR YOU? SMITH &amp; WESSON. - GOT ANY LEATHER FOR IT? - OH, OF COURSE, MATE. SHOULDER HARNESS, HOLLOW POINTS, SHORT SHELLS. WHAT'S THIS FOR? INTRUDERS? - NAME YOUR PRICE. - OH, YOU ARE, MATE. LET'S CALL IT 900. AMERICAN DOLLARS. - 900? LET'S CALL IT ARMED ROBBERY. - OH, HAVE A HEART, MATE. I HAVE A SICK MOM TO SUPPORT. - PLUMBER FORGOT HIS SNAKE. HELLO? YES? NO, NO, I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOUR CALL, MRS. MCQUEEN. - KATE. PLEASE CALL ME KATE, MR. WINGATE. - ALL RIGHT, YOU CALL ME HARRY. CATHCART PAINTED A PRETTY BLACK PICTURE OF THIS MAN, MCINALLY. WHAT'S YOUR HUSBAND DO FOR HIM? - THAT'S JUST ONE OF MY HUSBAND'S CLIENTS. - LESTER? - WE'VE KNOWN ONE ANOTHER A LONG TIME. - SORRY. I'M NOSEY. GOES WITH THE JOB. - IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU WHATEVER YOU WANT TO KNOW. - THANKS. I'LL REMEMBER THAT. - MCINALLY IS NEVER GONNA GIVE UP THAT OPAL, YOU KNOW. - HE'S GONNA HAVE TO COME UP WITH $400,000. - HE'LL NEVER GIVE YOU THAT EITHER. - NEVER SAY NEVER, MRS. MCQUEEN. - DON'T UNDERESTIMATE MR. MCINALLY. HE'S VERY DANGEROUS. - I NEVER UNDERESTIMATE ANYONE, MRS. MCQUEEN. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO GOING UP TO OPAL RIDGE WITH ME? - WHAT FOR? - I DON'T KNOW YOU. DON'T KNOW YOUR HUSBAND. MAYBE YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THE OPAL FROM MCINALLY. MAYBE YOUR HUSBAND'S WAITING FOR YOU AT THE AIRPORT. MAYBE YOU'RE JUST HERE TRYING TO THROW ME OFF THE TRACK. I DON'T KNOW. - THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I FOUND YOU, REMEMBER? - ALL I KNOW IS IF I'VE GOT YOU, I'VE GOT ONE LEG UP ON THAT OPAL. I LIKE BEING ONE LEG UP. WON'T YOU COME ALONG? - SO IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU AMERICANS. - WHAT'S THAT? PUSHY? - YES, ALL RIGHT, I'LL COME WITH YOU, BUT DON'T IMAGINE IT'S BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF YOU. IT'S BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MY HUSBAND. - WHY DO YOU PEOPLE SAY MCKINLEY WHEN IT'S M-A-C-I-N-A-L-L-Y? - IT'S JUST THE AUSTRALIAN WAY OF SAYING IT, I SUPPOSE. THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US AND YOU AMERICANS. THERE'S NO DOUBT YOU'VE GATHERED. - NOT TOO MANY. SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE SEEN YOUR HUSBAND? - THREE WEEKS. - AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM SINCE? - NO, NOTHING. GUESTS. - FRIENDS OF MCINALLY? - YOU CAN BET ON IT. - NICE DRIVING, MR. WINGATE. - THANK YOU, MRS. MCQUEEN. - LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! - THAT WILL TEACH 'EM TO MESS WITH A CALIFORNIA DRIVER. - READY. - BEAUTIFUL UP HERE. - MM. - NICE OUTFIT. - THANK YOU.

TRY THE WALGETT ROAD. - RIGHT. - YOU KNOW, MCINALLY'S GOT A WHOLE COLLECTION OF THUGS AROUND AND MORE MURDERERS AND TERRORISTS. - SOUNDS LIKE MY KIND OF PEOPLE. - ARE YOU REALLY READY TO DIE FOR AN OPAL? - IT'S A LIVING. I'M NOT READY TO DIE FOR ANYTHING, MRS. MCQUEEN. - ARE YOU MARRIED? - YOU COULD SAY THAT. YES. - YOU MEAN LIVING TOGETHER? - OH, YES. - WHAT'S SHE LIKE? - SHE'S A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN I AM, BUT SHE'S A REAL BEAUTY. - OLDER BY HOW MUCH? - LET'S SEE. 1924.

HE'S HAD YOU FOLLOWED EVER SINCE YOU GOT TO AUSTRALIA. - AND MAYBE HE DOESN'T KNOW I MADE IT TO OPAL RIDGE. - OH, COME ON. - THAT IS THE PLAN, MRS. MCQUEEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT. I'VE BEEN THINKING-- - I'M COMING WITH YOU, YOU KNOW. - I'D DO BETTER WITHOUT YOU. - THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID TO ME EARLIER TODAY. - I WANTED YOU HERE. - AND NOW? - NOW I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU. I TRUST YOU. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GET HURT. - WINGATE, YOU NEED ME. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE LAYOUT OF THE CASINO. - I'LL FIND IT. - IT'S AN ABANDONED MINE. MCINALLY LIVES UNDERGROUND. - I'LL FIND HIM TOO. - YOU WON'T, YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE WON'T TALK TO YOU. THEY'RE AFRAID OF HIM. I ALSO HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT TODAY IS THE DAY THAT ALL HIS MEN ARE OUT MAKING COLLECTIONS. WINGATE, I HAVE INFORMATION THAT WILL BE INVALUABLE TO YOU. - THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO. - COURSE THERE IS. WHAT? - RENT US A CAR. PICK ME UP OUT IN FRONT OF THE PLACE. IT'S GONNA BE A SHORT VISIT. - I'LL BE WAITING OUTSIDE WITH THE MOTOR RUNNING. - I'LL BE HERE OUT HERE IN 20 MINUTES.

BRUTUS CATHCART WANTS HIS OPAL, OR HE WANTS HIS MONEY BACK. YOU GIVE ME EITHER ONE, AND I'LL WALK RIGHT OUT OF HERE AND LEAVE YOU TO ALL YOUR NEUROSIS. - ARE YOU TRYING TO BE INSULTING THEN, MR. WINGATE? - I'M BEING DIRECT. WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT? - YOU WANT DIRECTNESS, LAD-IE? YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT HOLE IN THE GROUND. MR. CATHCART HAS NOT RECEIVED THE BLUE LIGHTNING BECAUSE HE HASN'T PAID FOR IT YET. - DIDN'T HE PAY YOU $400,000 CASH? - YES, INDEED. THAT'S CORRECT. - WASN'T THAT THE ASKING PRICE? - NO, NO. WHAT WAS AGREED WAS THAT MR. CATHCART WOULD PAY FAIR VALUE FOR THE OPAL. THE MARKET IS SOMETHING FIERCE. - OH, COME ON, LESTER. FIRST, YOU ASK HIM 300,000, AND HE PAID IT. AND YOU ASK HIM 350, AND HE PAID THAT. THEN YOU ASK HIM FOUR, AND HE PAID THAT. - WELL, THE MARKET. - WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND, LESTER? SNAKE OIL SALESMAN? - YOU HAVE NO DOUBT BEEN BRIEFED ON MY BACKGROUND. - YOU MEAN THE 56 INNOCENT PEOPLE YOU KILLED? - WELL, THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SIMPLY HAVE TO BE DONE. - YOU'RE DEAD RIGHT, LESTER. WHAT'D YOU DO WITH QUENTIN MCQUEEN? - I HAVEN'T SEEN QUENTIN IN DAYS, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO ON WITH YOUR RUDENESS, I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. - WHY DON'T YOU START BY PUTTING THAT OPAL ON THE TABLE? - DID YOU TRULY WALK IN HERE WITHOUT A CARE IF YOU EVER WALKED OUT AGAIN, OR IS IT DUMB LUCK THAT'S GOT YOU THIS FAR? YOU'RE THAT STUPID. YOU DON'T COMPREHEND THE SITUATION. WHICH IS IT? - I LIKE MY CHANCES, LESTER. - YOUR CHANCES ARE SLIM AND NONE. - MY ARM! - NO. - LET'S GO. - ANOTHER DAY, WINGATE.

MCINALLY. - HE DISAPPEARED OFF IN THE CENTER, MR. MCINALLY. IF YOU ASK ME TO BE STUPID, AND FOLLOW HIM IN THERE-- MR. MCINALLY? MR. MCINALLY? MY FINGERS. - ALMOST THERE, WINGATE. - ME TOO. - HANG ON. THREE MORE MINUTES. SOME FRIENDS OF OURS ARE THERE. DR. GILES AND REVEREND TROBRIDGE. WILLIAM, NINIAN, HELP ME.

I DO NOT KNOW HIS BLOOD TYPE, AND WE HAVEN'T GOT A LABORATORY, SO... - WHAT IS IT, HARRY? "O," YOUR BLOOD GROUP. POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE? HARRY? "O" POSITIVE. - WELL DONE, MADAM. - ANYONE HERE "O" POSITIVE? - I KNOW SOMEONE. - YOU'RE A NURSE TOO, HUH? - WHEN I WAS IN PARIS, ACTUALLY. - THAT'LL FIX HIM. MY BLOOD GOOD BLOOD. 40,000 YEARS OLD. - YOU ALL RIGHT, WILLIAM? - I'M FINE. THANK YOU. IF YOU'LL JUST GO AND WASH UP, MRS. MCQUEEN, WE'LL GET THIS PULLED OUT. NINIAN, WOULD YOU PLEASE BRING THE CART OVER HERE? THANK YOU. - 5 BUCKS SAYS IT'S A 9-MILLIMETER. - WELL, I'M NOT A BETTING MAN. IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THIS MAN IS WORTH SAVING. DON'T YOU THINK SO, MRS. MCQUEEN? THANK GOD HE'S A STRONG ONE. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT BULLET WOULD COME OUT. - YOU DID GREAT JOB, WILLIAM. - IF HE LIVES, MISSY. IF HE LIVES. YOU GOT ANY ICE LEFT? - FOR THE WOUND? - FOR MY SCOTCH. NINIAN? CAN YOU HELP ME MOVE THE PATIENT? KATE, YOU CAN GIVE A HAND TOO. I'D LIKE THAT SCOTCH. I WANT TO LOOK AT HIM FOR A WHILE. - HE LOOKS ALL RIGHT. - A LITTLE GRAY. THERE'S STILL SOME BLOOD IN HIM. - HAVE SOME COFFEE, NINIAN. - WHEN QUENTIN AND I WERE IN SEMINARY TOGETHER, WE VOWED TO LIVE CELIBATE IN THE ROMAN MANOR. DID YOU KNOW THAT? - YES, NINIAN. - WE DID, VOW IT, I MEAN, WITH ENTIRE SOLEMNITY, ON OUR KNEES IN THE CHAPEL AT MIDNIGHT. - I KNOW. - AND WE KEPT OUR VOW. WE DID, KATE. WE KEPT IT BEFORE THE LORD, UNTIL WE BOTH FELL IN LOVE. - I KNOW, NINIAN. - FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SAME WOMAN. - NINIAN, EVERY TIME I SEE YOU, YOU TELL ME THE SAME STORY. - OH, DO I? - YES, YOU DO, AND WHEN YOU DON'T TELL ME, QUENTIN DOES. - I DO BREAK APART. - HE WILL LIVE. - WHO WILL LIVE? - THE BIG WHITE FELLA. HE WILL LIVE FINE. - WELL, WE ALMOST LOST HIM, BUT HE CAME BACK STRONG AS A HORSE. - IS HE AWAKE? - YEAH, GO IN. GO IN. HELL, HE'D RATHER SEE YOU THAN ME. - MORNING. - MORNING TO YOU. - GOT A JOB FOR YOU. - WHAT'S THAT? - A AMBULANCE DRIVER. - MAYBE IF YOU STOPPED PLAYING WITH GUNS, YOU WOULDN'T GET SHOT QUITE SO OFTEN. - AND I WOULDN'T NEED A DRIVER. all: HEY, HEY, HEY. - HEY, HEY. - COME ON, YOU. - BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE. - IT IS, ISN'T IT? - CLEAN AIR. QUIET. - YES, IT'S STRANGER TO FIX EVERYONE THAT WAY. THAT'S WHY QUENTIN FOUNDED THE MISSION HERE. IT WAS A RUIN. HE REBUILT IT WITH THE HELP OF JAHRGADU AND HIS PEOPLE. THEY LOVE QUENTIN, ALMOST REVERE HIM. - HOW DOES THAT KIND OF MAN, WHEN HE HAS ALL THIS, END UP BEING A PRIVATE DETECTIVE? - THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH, I SUPPOSE. AS A PRIEST, HE NEVER REALLY KNEW WHETHER HE'D FOUND IT. AS A DETECTIVE, HE GETS TO THE REAL SORDID TRUTH. I DON'T KNOW. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? - SURE. MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO AN EX-COP. - I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM. - WELL, YOU KNOW THE PRIVATE EYE BUSINESS. HE'S PROBABLY OUT ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF RUNNING SURVEILLANCE ON NAKED LADIES. - YOU'RE A GREAT COMFORT TO ME, HARRY. - YOU... YOU WERE A GREAT COMFORT TO ME THIS MORNING. - WHEN I KISSED YOU THIS MORNING... - DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN IT. - QUENTIN AND I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP, BUT HE'S A PARTICULAR MAN. HE'S ALL TIED UP WITH GOD AND NATURE. I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH, BUT... - BUT WHAT? - GOOD MORNING. UH-HUH. THERE HE IS. HE'S BRIGHT AS A NEW DAWN. - WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME? - NO, MISS, DR.

A CUSTOM IN MY COUNTRY AMONG THE AMERICAN INDIAN. - AH, YES. - I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS BOTH WAYS, BUT I AM 1/8 AMERICAN INDIAN. - 1/8. - 1/8. MY TRIBE WAS OGLALA SIOUX. MY ANCESTOR, TACHUNKO WIKO, WAS A WAR CHIEF IN THE OGLALA SIOUX. - YOUR TRIBE FIGHT IN WARS? - AGAINST THE WHITE MAN. OUR CHIEF, WHOSE OTHER NAME WAS CRAZY HORSE, HELPED DEFEAT THE WHITE MAN AT THE LITTLE BIG HORN. - YOUR TRIBE FIGHT IN WARS AGAINST THE WHITE MAN. - WE USED TO. - THAT IS VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS. - YES, VERY SERIOUS.

QUENTIN HAS DONE MUCH THE SAME SORT OF THING. - STILL NO WORD? - NOTHING. - WELL, YOU KNOW, QUENTIN-- HE'LL BE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE'S DISAPPEARANCE, A LOST CHILD, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, RIGHT? OH, HE'LL COME CALLING SOON. UH-HUH. ARE YOU GOING IN AFTER MCINALLY? WELL, THEN YOU CAN FORGET THE WOUND. - THAT'S RIGHT. - BECAUSE THIS TIME, HE'S GONNA BLOW YOUR FOOL HEAD RIGHT OFF. - THANKS FOR THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, DOC. - THREE YOUNG BULLS ESCAPED FROM THE BRANDING. I'M GOING UP TO LOOK FOR THEM. - JAHRGADU? THIS MAN THAT SHOT ME, MCINALLY... - BAD FELLA. - I'M GOING AFTER HIM. HE'S GOT A BUNCH OF MEN WITH GUNS. I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE I COULD GET YOU AND SOME OF YOUR MEN TO GO ALONG, GIVE ME A HAND. - NO, THAT'S WHITE FELLAS BUSINESS. - JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK. - HO. - IN SURE AND CERTAIN HOPE AT THE RESURRECTION TO ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. WE COMMEND TO ALMIGHTY GOD, OUR BROTHER QUENTIN, AND WE COMMIT HIS BODY TO THE GROUND. EARTH TO EARTH, ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST. THE LORD, BLESS HIM AND KEEP HIM. THE LORD, MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON HIM AND BE GRACIOUS ONTO HIM. THE LORD, LIFT UP HIS COUNTENANCE UPON HIM AND GIVE HIM PEACE. AMEN. - AMEN. - THE LORD BE WITH YOU. - AND WITH THY SPIRIT. - LET US PRAY. OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN--OH, EXCUSE ME.
