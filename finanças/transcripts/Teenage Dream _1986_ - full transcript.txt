Hey, Tommy. - In a minute, Leo. - Why are you out so late? - I got an detention from Ms. Bukowski. - Oh not again? Yeah, she said she didn't want me to wear clothes like this in her class.

Good afternoon Ms. Honstavich. I'm certainly looking forward... to a big heaping helping of your delicious cream salmon today. It's my fave! You're looking lovely today, Ms.Honstavich. Are you using a new razor? - Tammy. - Tammy, over here. Can you go riding? Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Shit, the only new girl in school and all she cares about is mark moneybag Sanders. If you're so hot for her, just go out and get her. She doesn't even know I exist, Leo. You gotta do something to get her attention. - Wear antlers on your head. - Huh? So she'll know you're horny. You're a diseased person, Leo. Listen you can't worry about Leah, huh? She's got an ego bigger than her charge account, if that's possible. Yeah, well, she's the best gymnast on the team. All the more reason to hate her. She eats like a pig, it's disgusting. She just stuffs her face and never puts on a pound. I have to die like crazy to stay in shape. Do you? You're a gymnast aren't you? I've seen you in the gym with equipment, and you seem to know what you're doing? Is that being nosy? No, I competed a few years ago back in my home in San Francisco. - But that was a long time ago. - You should come out and work out with us. - Never mind. So who do you have for english? - Ms. Gartz. Oh, Ms. B.O. ('body odour'), gross, huh? He is a beauty. You're here to train, Stacy, not to exercise your glands. Thank you, Mark. Ms. Stoller, can I talk to you for a second? Robin helps out in gym, because she does gymnastics herself. And I think she's good too. Robin, come over here for a minute? Why don't you show us a couple of free hips in a dismart? Would you mind, Tammy? - Ms. Stoller... - Just a couple of free hits. Okay? Okay. This should be good. Ouch. - Very impressive - Not bad. Why don't you try it again. - I'd better go. - Do you believe her. She is so pathetic. Hey. How's it going? Hey, I was wondering if like, you know, me and you... could get together tonight? and... study, something like that? I'm not in the mood, Tommy. Okay? I want to be alone. Okay, you want be alone. Be alone. You got it! It's not the end of the world, Robin. You can always try again? Mom, who you kidding. Even if I could work myself back into shape, it wouldn't do any good? All the kids on the gym team think I'm some kind of geek. Maybe they are right. Don't be like that, you know what I think, I think you will compete again someday. Someday? Mom, that's what parents tell their kids when they mean 'never'. I remember, the night the policeman came ...and told me that you and your dad had been in the accident And the first thought that... that went through my mind was Please... ...if one of them has to be taken, don't let it be Robin. She has her whole life ahead of her. So much to do yet. And I guess somebody heard me. Please. Don't let that prayer go to waste. Fred? Fred? Fred? Fred, are you here? Fred? Come on Fred, stop clowning around. Come out, come out. Wherever you are. - Police! Police! Stop it. - Drop it now. Kick it over here. - On your stomach. - Come on drop. Jesus, it's just a kid, Harry. Sorry to scare you. There's been a lot of break-ins around here lately. You better find someplace else to play. Now get out of here. Now what's wrong? You just keep to emotion. There's no finish. None of that. You are not putting any effort in it. I don't have to. - Leaving early again, Stacy? - Yes, I have a date. Just answer me one question, Stacy. Are you a member of this team, or not? Ms. Stoller, give me a break. I do have a social life now. Ms. Stoller, I have something to show you. Okay. Leah... Wow! - Way to go! - Way to go, Robin. Yeah, I still think Ms. Stoller is taking pity on me. Oh, the lady doesn't even know how to spell the word. Besides you made it. You're the new member of the 'Flyers'. - Hi, Carly. - Hi. I' won't be late tonight. Mom, this is my friend from school, Robin, this is my mom. - Hi, Mrs. Tunis. - Pleased to meet you, Robin. - Oh, you won't forget to practice? - Do I ever? Come on, let's sweat. Wow! Yeah, my dad built it for me after he and my mom broke up. What you're looking at is a massive guilt trip. - What is your dad a millionaire or something ? - Close, he's a doctor. - Shall we dance? - Shall we! - You're amazing. - Hardly. Seriously, I can barely keep up with you. How is your leg? Well it still hurts a little bit, but it's getting better. - What happened to it? - There was a car accident. My dad was killed. He helped me training, you know. He was always there. Pushing me. Making me work harder. You know sometimes when I'm practicing... I close my eyes... and I can see him standing there, just like before. That makes me feel good. But it's,... it's not the same. These fish are an ace investment. Once people see these little beauties, they are rolling in the dough. They're pretty. You better believe it they cost me enough. They're the perfect pet, eat hardly nothing, they don't bark and they practically live forever. Joel, that one looks dead. - First, Robin, come in please. - Roy, Fred, what's happening? Hey, I made it on the gym team. I'm now a member of the 'Flyers'. - Well how about that, you did it. - Check her out... ...she's finally hit the big time. Hey I hope you didn't get into any trouble with the police, Fred? Hey, no... I didn't get in no trouble. I just got fired. - Fired? - Robin, don't blame yourself. Fred never could hold on to a job. Well that is a record that I am deeply proud of. You know, you think after all these years around the world, the city will pay for my dry cleaning. Uh, we have a stain here, Robin. I'm sorry, look we'll do it over again. No charge, Roy. - What do you think you're doing? - I was just gonna do this shirt over again. I'm breaking my back around here to get this place out of the hole. And you're gonna start handing out damn free. - Well, I was just trying to... - Don't you talk back to me. - Hey man, no harm done. - You keep your nose out of this. - Hey man, don't get upset. - No. Considerate brat, people coming in... Hey look, see we're paying for the shirts, okay? No harm done. This Sucker is lucky my cousin is holding me back. - See you later, Robin. - This Jack, what the hell he thinks he is? - I'm sorry, Jack. - I swear sometimes I... Jack! Sorry, Marge. I never would have done that. I swear that kid of yours is gonna be the death of me. I just want you to remember something. As far as I'm concerned you're not a member of this team. You you never were, and you never will be. Leah, I don't want a fight. You've already got one. I don't have to remind you, that the state of regional finals are just a few short months away. Every year in the past the 'Flyers' have managed to come out of those regionals without a single gold medal. I hope you're as ashamed of that record, as I am. In the next few weeks... I shall be choosing three girls to represent this team at that meet. But let's get something straight, right now. I'm looking for winners. It's merely you can't take a little competition? Let's teach her a lesson she won't forget. I don't pay attention to her, so that she pays attention to me. Bingo. - Leo, this is stupid. - Tommy, when you grow up... Girls go nuts, when you ignore them. If she sees that you're not interested in her, she'll be drooling for you. - Here, put these on. - What for? Just do it. - Uh, I can't see anything. - She comes. - Leo, if this does'nt... - Trust me. - Does she see me ignoring her yet? - Shhh! Not yet. - Is she looking yet? - Not yet, she's reading something. - Really, what's she reading? - What the hell should I know? - Is she drooling yet? - She is gone. - Leo, what happened? - I don't know. She read this note, she got a really weird look on her face and she ran away. Shit! I'm sick of playing this game. I'm not playing it anymore. From now on, I'm a free agent. Look out girls, it's open season on Tommy Wernick. Drop by my place tomorrow night at eight for a party. It'll be wild so dress funky. Love, Mark. I don't believe it? We're moving up in the world, aren't we? I'll go shopping tomorrow for some clothes. You wanna come? Shopping? You've just said the magic word, all right. Oh this is a joke, right? It's going to be fantastic, you'll see. Do they take credit cards?

For the next two months, that's what I will demand from you. Anyone who wants to compete in those regionals has to give me just one thing: Perfection. Tommy. - He's got stamina doesn't he? - Carly, there's got to be some... ..way to make him notice me? You have a fry? No. We've gotta lose five pounds by the end of the week. What kind of diet do you want? I wake up in the morning and I take a deep breath of air. And that's it. I'm kidding. I wish. I 'm just cutting down. I gotta go study for this test tomorrow.

He's been going out with Laura Pennington lately. - I'm sorry, I didn't know that. - I thought half the city knew by now. God I'm stiff. I didn't realize... how out of shape I was, until I started getting back into training again. Robin, have you got a boyfriend? No. It's my fault, I guess. There's this one guy, but... I don't think he isn't interested in me anymore. Take it from me: Guys aren't worth a shit. Come on, Gillian. You can't really mean that. Maybe it's just me. You know, I really don't have time for that kind of thing anyway. I mean, Ms. Stoller, she's got us so busy, you know, to get back into shape for the original meets. I guess if you win, the prize money would be pretty good? - There's no prize money, Gillian. - What? Yeah, the medals aren't even real gold. Sounds like a pretty rotten deal to me, kid? Oh no, Gillian, it's not. Really. I don't know, for me ...when I'm out and tumbling across those mats I change. It's like a whole other kind of world. Someplace... ...better. When that happens, it's like nothing can touch me. I guess that's how birds must feel when they're flying. Do you have felt like that? No. But I wish I could. I think Tommy is kind of cute, don't you? Oh Robin, I'm so sorry. Oh what's the matter, Leah? I thought that cats like milk? Did it, solid. I will now announce my three choices. When these girls go to the regionals in niagara in fall next month, I expect one of them to come back with a gold medal. I won't accept anything less. I hope you won't either. Leah Kilbourne. Tammy Yamada. Robin Crew. What? Stacy, your backup. If for any reason one of the competitors drops out, then you will take her place. - How dare you choose her over me. - She works, Stacy. All the time, not just when she feels like it. You can't. One more word from you, young lady. Not only will you lose your backup reserve, you'll be kicked out of the team as well. None of these choices are written in stone. I can change the competing team anytime. If any of you fail to impress me, then... I'll be glad to replace you with someone who can. - Carly. - Hey I heard the news. Congratulations You've deserved to be going to that meet, more than I do. - Come on, I blew it by myself, Robin. I need a break anyway. About the stuff I said earlier, you know... I didn't mean it, huh? I's okay. I want to get some extra training before the regionals. I got this empty gym with its own private rooting section. - Okay. - Okay. Thanks. - I'm starved, you know. - What? I think we need these cheeseburger to celebrate. Please, get cheeseburgers.

Oh. C'est la vie. What is this, Tommy? We'll finish this later, Stacy. - Well I'm back, good as new. - Robin, I must be honest with you. - You always have been? - No, no I haven't. You're good, don't ever think you're not, but you're still rough. I was good enough to make the competition team? I had another reason for putting on the team. Leah is the best gymnast we have. At least she can be, when she works hard. But she wasn't. She wasn't hungry enough. She's the best and she knows it. She needed needed someone to push her. Someone to compete against. So you made me the competition. When I saw you both in the driving. I saw a fire in Leah, that I haven't seen in months it made all the difference. - You set me up. - I've put Stacy on the team. She's better than you. I'm sorry, Robin. - You said you wanted winners. - Robin. I'm not gonna let you take this away from me Ms. Stoller. You said you wanted a fighter. Well, you've got one. I'll prove myself to you. - I suppose I can't stop you. - I'm taking this all the way, Ms. Stoller. Come on Robin, that's enough. No. - How long you're going to keep this up? - Until I'm perfect.

So that's the great Rhonda Hamilton. She's not so hot. Are you scared? No. So am I. Testing, testing. One, two, three. Attention, please. Would all competing gymnastic teams please assemble for the first event. Thank you. Okay. It's show time. Terrific. That was perfect. Don't worry about it. Pay attention. Now we get our perfect gymnast. Ladies and gentlemen,... Rhonda Hamilton of 'Niagara Falls Rockets' has dropped from the competition. No good, ..that means her arms.. Leah Kilbourne of the 'Buffalo Flyers' is now at first place. Yes, that's it for the bars. We'll see outside, okay? I'll see you, when you've changed. The competition will resume with the final floor routines at six o'clock. - Gold always was my favorite color. - But it's a pretty lousy way to win, Leah. There's no bad way to win. But then you wouldn't know anything about winning? Nice try, Robin. - Oh god, whoever that is, thanks. - No charge. Roy, Fred, you guys made it. Hey, you think we missed a chance to see our star in action? Some star, I'll be lucky if I can hold on to second place. Leah is close to getting that gold medal then she ever was, now. Rhonda is out of the running. I got something to show you, girl. You're coming with me. I can't. The floor routines are gonna start a couple of hours. You'll be back in plenty of time. - We're going for a walk on the falls. - Okay. Hey, what falls? His name was Blondin and he was the greatest acrobat that ever lived. He walked that wire across the falls a hundred times. Whether fog, ice, rain, he survived it all. He didn't know fear and nobody ever duplicated what he did. Blondin didn't think about winning. And he wasn't worried about beating anybody. When he was doing all those amazing things,... Do you know the one thing he was thinking about? Just getting his ass across the falls. That's all. Getting his ass across the falls. Now you think about that, before you go back into the auditorium. She's got five minutes left.
