What are you up to? I'm prepping for framing. I'm looking for what will best suit the images we need. The thing is... You won't stop moving? Have you ever seen people having motionless sex? No. But it must be beautiful. One last time, is that important for you? Would you say it has to be prepared like a first time? We give a lot of importance to our first times, and then, our last times... they slip through our fingers. Could you tell us how you made your decision? I spent a week in Switzerland, and I met people who were going for assisted suicide. They were so serene, determined. ONE LAST TIME I realised that my body had always belonged to me. And I wanted it to belong to me till the end. Is coitus better without penetration? You're asking if I've only had clitoral orgasms? Not at all. No, no. What do you mean? Orgasms can only be clitoral, for anyone who still has a clit. In what way? OK. - I don't understand. - Wait a second. Bear with me. Look. Right there... I'm touching my clitoris, right? Yes. Go on, do it. Done. Yes. If you also slip a finger inside... Like that? Can you curl your finger a bit? All right. OK. Well, right now, you're actually touching your clitoris... from the inside. The bulbs, the whole shebang. There you go. So, penetration versus clitoris, it's bullshit, it doesn't exist. It's nice, isn't it? | don't believe I ever gave any thought. Being penetrated or not? Who? When? I always acted instinctively. I don't have much of a... cerebral approach to sex. I do. How did you decide that your last time would be with someone you don't know? I wanted it to be arousing, something new. It needs to be new to be arousing? For me, undoubtedly. I did something I never would have done before. Or rather, that I wouldn't have allowed myself to do. I placed an ad. You placed an ad? To meet someone who isn't part of my social circle. What did your ad say? "One day, it will be the last time I'll make love. "I'd like to be aware of it. I want to prepare myself for it. "Prepare it "with the person who will be my last encounter. "I'm 69 years old, my body and soul are free, "and alive. "Send pictures, a few words, an object, contact information. " Hang on. Did you receive objects? A rope. Really, I'm not joking. It was probably to tie you up. How many replies did you get? Twelve. But I didn't keep them all. Can I put the paper away? Hold it out. Yeah. Right in front of your face. Nice and straight. I was intrigued. It touched me. It... It turned me on a little, I think. And I thought to myself that I might be the man for the job. So, you're a sex god. I was a plumber for ten years. So, you watch a lot of porn. I do, indeed. Well... I used to go to the Beverley with my partner. That was a lifetime ago. The late Beverley. - It closed down recently, right? - Yes. I doubt we will see clitorises on the big screen again. Or double-headed pussies. So, I was also a water diviner. A water diviner, with a dowsing rod? I have the best of methods. It gives women tears of joy. I make them squirt and I don't need a rod. Is there something that you've never done before... and that you'd like to do? Make love blindfolded. I've never done it. I've always made love with my eyes wide open. With the lights on. In my day, if a woman enjoyed watching sex, it was somewhat taboo, so, I acquired the habit. But I never made love blindfolded. Does that answer your question? Perfectly. How can I please you? Like that? Sorry. Ouch! Can I slip my fingers inside you? Yes. Wait, I'll just curl my fingers a little more. - Yes. - Like that. There, I should be precisely touching the G spot. There... Wait. I'm sorry. No but... Wait. Normally, this method should give pleasure to women. I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. No. Sandra, you see? I'm sorry. Should I get naked when he buzzes? - No. - No? Hello, Salom?. Hello, J?r?me. - Can I put my coat down? - Yes, of course. Thanks. - Nice place. - Thanks. What did you reply to Salom? to make her want to meet you? That I kissed like a god... Do you want to try? Maybe you could say a few words to get things started. Hum... I want to get my penis out. By all means, make yourself at home. No, I mean... I'm kidding, I... I'm... I'm moved, that's all. So, when you're moved, you want to get your penis out. No, not exactly. I really am moved. I mean, it's... Someone's last time, that's quite peculiar. You know. That's why I like age. Laughter... - Plenty of laughter? - Yes. People? Salt? Too much sun, maybe? A 69-year-old face, basically. Kiss me. Careful. I kiss like a god. You're hard. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Is it the first time you see yourself? Yes. How do you feel? I don't know. I see myself... and how much I love myself. I see that you mainly filmed him, didn't you? Really? Baloney! Really, one can sense that you love testosterone. I love you too, look. I still look good. I'm sure it was her. Look. She got all dressed up. The one with the hat. Maybe not. Or maybe her? Look, there. - Which one? - There. On your right. - The one with the dog? - Yes. Nope. I don't think she would bring her dog along. Well... There's no harm in bringing a dog along. If she stands you up, she wouldn't do it here. Or at least round the corner. Yeah, maybe round the corner. Well, it's her loss. - Would you like some herbal tea? - Yes, please! Spot on. Break time. It's your loss, Nathalie. To be fair, it's normal to get cold feet, considering. Yeah. Maybe. - You've never been with a woman? - No. Wow, I never would have guessed. It's not that I didn't want to. But as the years went by, the more... my virginity bothered me. I just thought that it didn't happen for a reason. But you're still around. I bet our Nathalie got the address wrong, and she'll ring the doorbell today, and... When were you really 60? In 1999? It would be a shame to let numbers get in the way. It's lying that gets in the way for me, period. Do you want me to leave? Please don't. You have every right to be upset. I haven't been 60 years old for quite a while. I'm four times twenty. But deep inside, I'm a young man who doesn't want to grow old and dared to hope to seduce you. It's not the case, so, I bid you farewell. What? He played me for a fool, right? He was charming. Go get him then. You only like age on yourself, not on others. That's beside the point. Are you OK? You're fit and healthy, it's surprising. Yes, this is unusual. You don't decide to... Just like that... And you're cheerful, so... I mean, you certainly don't look unhappy. I want to end on a high note actually. That's one way to look at it, smart! It's a bit gloomy, but smart. - Actually... - It's not gloomy, believe me. - I'll think about it. - What made you want to come? To be honest, when we saw your ad, it struck a chord. - Yeah. - Really? How come? We can't have children. That's private. Yes, but it explains why we felt touched. We also did it one last time. That's how it felt to us. We could say that. Wait a second. "One last time"? What do you mean? Well, the last time we made love trying to get pregnant, we were hoping... We were hoping to have a baby. So, that day, after we made love, we started thinking about... how we would grow old. Yes. Without children... One can age well without children. It's possible. - You think? - I'm living proof. - That's true. - Yes. But what about you? I mean, how will you stop aging? Take it easy, Fleur. Well... It's OK. I think it's beautiful. I mean, to have the choice. It's a blessing. - I hope we'll also have the choice. - Hum... But how do you see yourself doing it? There aren't that many ways... Yes, there are. - There are plenty of ways. - Really? But don't you ever doubt? I have always doubted everything. But I always made a decision. Incidentally, I have to make a choice. Which one of you replied to the ad? The gentleman from the letter, from our letter, is us. Us as a couple. - Both of us - There isn't a choice to make. I need to put on a condom. Or I'll come in two minutes. OK, I'll fetch it. - They're right here. - In my pocket. I'll get them. - Do you want to be on top? - Yes. Have you thought about your last meal? Of course. What Will it be? A panada, oysters, marzipan, and fine wine. Tucked up in bed with a movie. Alone? Alone. What movie? Hum... Careful with the knife. I know what I'm doing. As for the film, I haven't decided yet. I want a dance film. I want to see radiant, light bodies. Could you stop filming while we eat? No, Salom?. This is interesting. As interesting as it was to film me masturbating? I'm only teasing. Fried or scrambled? Ff ted. Please. Anyhow... I saw you do it. Saw what? I don't want you filming between my legs. I find it ugly. - You find your sex ugly? - No. Whatever you dislike, we can edit out. I'm not doing porn. I don't have an issue with what my sex looks like, just don't film it. OK. I think you can film sex without filming my sex. Film the last day of your arse without your arse? Don't you think you might have ten good years ahead of you? I mean, living in this flat which you adore, without any major health issues. What would I do? You could meet a man. Meet a man, and then what? And then fall in love. "Fall in love", and then? I don't know, you could write, love, eat oysters, panadas, squander all your savings on vintage wine. Grow old... Grow old, it can be wonderful. I'm 69, I should be grateful. You never know... Stop! Stop it. Besides, I drink and smoke. Every New Year's, I wonder if I'll still be around another year. Every morning, I look in the mirror, I can see my body gradually pulling me downwards. Some things have shut down, others have disappeared, and they won't come back, but that's OK with me. What's not OK with me is to end up disabled in a hospital bed, forgotten in a hospice, rotting in my diapers. Don't be silly. Aren't you afraid? I haven't always been alive. It's just an injection. Salom?... Sandra, this film isn't about my choice. Yes, I know. If I had those breasts, I'd give myself another 20 years. You can inherit them, if you like. Nonsense. That's gross. I'll leave them to MDMD. As long as I get the film done... The rest... - We're being stood up again. - No, he'll be here. I hope so. - He left a good impression on me. - Why? He sent me a picture of his mother. And get this, she is sublime. - You're so silly! - Yes. What time is it? 6.03 pm. It's dead in the water. - What? - Gosh... It's surprising that you used that expression. It's a bit ironic to be saying that today. Of course. - What? - You're afraid. - Am I? - It's normal. Remind me... your age 35, you know that. It's normal to be scared of dying when you're 35. Ah... Well... I'm disappointed. Disappointed? What about? The lack of clarity. I wasn't thrilled. Even with J?r?me? When you saw yourself, you seemed moved. Yes, by the sight of myself. - I want to feel alive, Sandra. - Make up your mind! That's what sex is for, dammit! Oh, yes! Sex, dammit. I made a butterfly wing for you. Thank you. Good job I found an external battery at home. You got things started? Yes. OK. You are delightful, madam. Not old, far from it. Thank you. You can be less formal with me. I'd rather not. Why? It's more arousing, no? Very well. What would please you? A coffee-flavored eclair. Mickael, why don't you... get naked'? To get things started. - What? Is it my jockstrap? - Yeah. That's so cool. Turn around. Salom?, put the camera down. No. That's inconvenient. Why? Because I can't see your face. And what if I want to film? I want to trade places. That's all. What do you think of our filmmaker? Sorry? I think... she's a pro. Do you fancy her? She's a bit young. Oh, you don't fancy her? I do. I think she's also craving for warmth and flesh. She wants to be a body too. Er... Salom?, I don't think I should get naked in my own documentary. How narrow-minded of you... Narrow-minded? No. I want it to be my film as well. And I want you in it. After all, whatever you dislike, we can edit out. I'm not making porn, you know. You're crazy. Do you want to stop? No. Carry on. Yes. Carry on. Carry on. Come, little butterfly. Are you filming us? Yes. And you're perfect. I can't come. Do you want me to lick you? - No. - No. Where were you? Having a smoke. And then I brushed my teeth. How come? Because I wanted to kiss you. OK... Sandra... Yes. Carry on. Yes. Salom?. Yes? I want to film us. But we're no longer casting. Precisely. OK. I feel good. Me too. What are you doing? Your breasts... They're lovely. It's beautiful. Wait. What are you doing? Yes. Come. Yes. Feels good. Come on. You're beautiful. Wait. What are you doing? You're beautiful. Take off your blindfold. Look. Look. Enjoy it. Look. I'll show you. Carry on. Yes, yes. I'm here. My name is Salom? Laviere. I'm 69 years old. I am of Basque origin, I graduated from high school in 1969. I made love for the first time in 1968. Just before Jean, my boyfriend at the time, left to join the army. The first time I bled, I remember it well too. I stained my grandmother's sheets, and I got told off. Even though I hadn't done anything. Then, my aunt slapped me. An absurd tradition. Yet firmly established. The last time I had my period, I don't remember. Nor do I recall the last time I kissed the last man I ever loved. The last time I made love with a man, I'm not sure when that was, but it was with Patrick. The first time I made love with a woman, her name was Sandra. The last time I made love, it was with Sandra and it was beautiful. Subtitles: H?l?ne Mercier & No?l Pavageau ONE LAST TIME
