Upper Volta, August 1983. A socialist revolution led by Captain Thomas Sankara takes control. The country is renamed Burkina Faso. The new president frantically implements reforms which culminate in his assassination on October 1987, at the hands of Blaise Compaoré, his long-term associate. A dictatorship takes over. It goes on to last 27 years. On October 2014, Blaise Compaoré’s regime is overturned by a country of young people who adhere to Sankara’s legacy. Rapper, Smockey, a founding member of the Balai Citoyen movement, is at the forefront of the anti-Compaoré dispute. He embodies a generation driven by Thomas Sankara’s ideology. The slave who cannot struggle for his emancipation doesn't deserve our empathy. Only fighting sets you free. Smockey does not surrender. A long time ago, from far away. Smockey never surrenders. Smockey's here again. Always there, when and where you need him. Always there, especially in times of discontent. Smockey never surrenders No one must ever surrender No one must ever surrender No longer will we all surrender We must never surrender Four: The bling bling are in control Five: Social climbers have the monopoly Six: They think their status symbols will earn them respect like in the Capitol That's not the way it works Respect comes at a price Your possessions will lobotomize you Your car won't earn you respect Some people chase after brands and bling always wanting to obey unable to bear their pathetic existence The weak must pay for their insignificance Do you think you're worth your education? Now you're the one with the balls If the solution depends on the equation Submission depends on the position Smockey never surrenders No one must surrender No one must surrender. TIME IS ON OUR SIDE Good evening. How are you? How are you? - I'm fine. Ho! How are you, bro? I saw you... - Are you well? Respect. We're here. We really didn't want to carry on but, in the end... We were greeting people. I dedicate this award to all those who fought, to all those great fighters: Lumumba, Thomas Sankara. And I hope with all my heart that our current leaders will not trample on the legacy that we were left all the way to the Pantheon of pointlessness. These aren't my headphones. You're used to the other ones. - Yes, I am. This slavery is political Migration is a dead end Far from yourself, far from your rights Never forget you have a home to go back to Shall we begin? - Yes. This slavery is political Migration is a dead end Far from yourself, far from your rights Never forget you have a home to go to. One more take? - One more, yes. Listen to that! I missed my queue. Go ahead. This slavery is political Migration is a dead end... Let's take it from the top. It's good, it's getting there. AFTER THE REVOLT NOW VOTE I think it's here... Hold on, I might be talking rubbish. It's here. The fragments are there. Sankara's grave was somewhere around here. That piece says: "President, head of State." Sankara's grave. His associates were buried nearby. They were also buried with him. Thirteen. Something strange, a funny coincidence... Maria, my elder sister, died in October 1983, the year when Sankara became the President of Upper Volta, which was later to become Burkina Faso. Sankara died in October 1987 and he's buried in the same cemetery. Strange coincidence. I wasn't even aware of that. We've not even done half of what... ... many freedom fighters like Le Che or Sankara have done or Nasser and all those people, Modibo Keïta, to a lesser extent. They all contributed to our dignities. So, we have the opportunity to make change a reality if we look upon our past without making excuses. I saw a popular surge of Burkina Faso citizens, a united movement, a resurgence of dignity, of determination like we haven't seen for many years, being exerted throughout the whole land. And even drawing on their resources to fight the putschists who wanted to ruin our revolution. That is a revolution. It's just that then you can say whatever you want. Some say: "The mountain brought forth a mouse." Some say that it's not a revolution in terms of what happened next. But, in that case, wouldn't we say that the 1789 French Revolution brought forth an empire led by Napoleon Bonaparte? I consider all this as a transition phase. The new civilian government has been in power for two and a half years. We have the chance to see the process through, including elections in 2020. What I say is, to succeed, you must believe. First you believe and then it's possible. The killers are lying in the first houses close to the entrance barrier and in the bushes lining the paths. A grenade rips apart the leading car. Olympe Bamouni, the President's chief of press, Fréderic Ziembé, legal advisor, are killed instantly. Sankara and nine guards manage to take refuge in a nearby house. Lying face down in the corridor, they retaliate. But the house is surrounded. An offensive hand grenade is thrown inside. An injured Sankara says: "It's pointless, they're looking for me." He stands up calmly and heads towards the door. His body is ripped apart by Kalashnikov fire. The killers invade the house, shooting everyone in sight. Manna of creation, put an end to our curse of sad reflection of the hopelessness at the dawn of our lives. May the dawn avenge our Hottentot Venuses. We're ready, soldiers. Here are my words as a lowly troubadour. Whatever happens, we are the heirs of people like Norbert Zongo, of people like Thomas Sankara, of people like Joseph Ki Zerbo, of people like Dabo Boukary, etc, etc... The list is long. But we'll never be followers of people like Blaise Compaoré, people like François Compaoré, people like Djibril Bassolé, people like... General Diendéré. People like... There are so many. Our ancestors are our witnesses. Lies will be torn apart. The fact is, we must all go through it, we're all going to die. May everyone weigh their conscience. If it's a worthy fight, may they continue it! If it's not a worthy fight, may they disregard it. One thing is for sure, as we've always said, Thomas Sankara is still our pioneer. On this day on October 15 1987, it has now been 30 years that the justice system has been unable to serve justice. Somebody born that way, who devoted his life to fulfilling his dream. Today, our responsibility is to ensure that this dream becomes reality here in Faso. Sankara's dream must be fulfilled. "Dare to invent the future." These are not just words. I want to invite to the stage someone who has revolutionized and contributed a lot to Burkinabe rap and to music in general and who no longer needs an introduction. I'd like to invite to the stage, the man they call Smockey! Good evening. Are you well? - Yes, I'm fine. Good evening, are you well? Greetings, are you well? No, you see, how many years has it been? There are some lyrics that you remember but I don't and lyrics I remember and you don't. Yes, inevitably. You had your favorite lyrics too. Everything that was... What was it called? Just Cool Rap. No, Just for War. We used to rap in English... It wasn't our thing. Then Smockey says: "Hold on, your phonetics are wrong!" And he starts writing his lyrics. - That's true! "This is the story of a goat who goes out one day to vote." It's crappy, but people get it! - Exactly! That's an old one! Was there as much political activity? Upper Volta's first democratic elections were held. The UPV! Yes, but the most well-known ones... The country was divided. There was the UNDD-RDA. That was back when Félix Houphouët Boigny carried some weight in the region. In the end, I think the African Democratic party won. Back then people called me "Mr. Deputy." Because I was so interested in these political issues: The UNDD, the RDA, or not the RDA or the UNDD... This was the first democratic election to be held in Upper Volta. At the time of Blaise's CDP, they tell you: "If you want to vote, "put a tick next to Blaise and stick your slip in the envelope." What if you don't want to vote for Blaise? "In that case, put a line through Blaise "and stick it in the envelope." You were screwed! Explain that to the people. In both cases, you've voted for Blaise. That's why we're forced to use elephants and lions as symbols. That was before. It was before? It's still like that now. We need to introduce a scale system so people can find their way around it. We say: "This is what we call "the minimum IQ of the masses." If we don't reach this level of IQ, let's not even mention democracy! You say that these people must have a certain IQ level. That's bullshit! Between 80% and 90% of intellectuals have resigned. On the other hand, these know-it-alls are the closest enemies... They're the closest friends of these dictatorial regimes! The closest friends of this repressive system, this system that locks everything down. Those people work harder to maintain the system than the peasants who understand everything but have no way of taking action. Despite not having this information, these guys are far more objective and far more realistic than all these pseudo-intellectuals who went to school, useless idiots who are up to their eyes in diplomas. That's the reality. We've set fire to the Assembly. We've set fire to the Assembly. It's over. With fire you can burn everything, you can wipe everything away . They call me Smoke. They call me Smoke. Some people even say I'm crazy. But I couldn't care less. They say I'm crazy because I talk to myself. But in fact, I don't. I'm talking to my buddy, my friend, my confident. His name is Blaise. I tell him everything but he doesn't say much. He wants to make me think that his mind is working. One night, he wanted to introduce me to a friend. I think his name was Sankara. This guy was neurotic, a real wacko, a guy who always has something to say, even when there's nothing to say. So, I said to Blaise: "I like your friend, but... "He talks too much. "He also thinks too much. "I think he goes too far. "Let me speak to him with the weight of my experience." So, I encourage him. Not too much. Since that day, I've never seen him again. Another night, he wanted to introduce me to another friend. Zongo. I said: "Blaise, let me stop you right there. "Every time you introduce someone to me, "I never see him again." So, when he persisted with his famous Mr. Article 37, I said: "Stop!" But too late. Now it's Blaise who I don't see anymore. My wounds aren't healing. My wounds aren't closing up. My wounds are half-open, coming apart and oozing pus, stinking out the mascara. Throughout the whole show, before the fall of Blaise, I mean, when we were performing in front of the audience, you felt this sense of tension, giving you the impression that... In fact, it felt like we were in... People were afraid, they were afraid when they were watching you. They were afraid that something might suddenly happen. I think it was also very daring. Very daring to call out the name of the President in a show while he's still in power and accuse him of certain serious acts. It's daring to do that within a show. All day, the riot police have been hunting down young people and Balai Citoyen members. So, it was very heated! They're each devising a strategy to hold out as long as possible as the objective was to camp out in the area surrounding the Rond Point des Nations Unies, in order to wait in front of the Assembly. All night, it was heating up and, around 6 PM, I was on the Place de la Révolution and Boukary le Lion was there talking to the crowd and struggling to contain them. Hundreds of riot police were ready to charge. I was asked to address the crowd. I had to go up there and explain to people. In the end, despite many difficulties, it worked. We said: "It's not avoidance, it's taking a step back to come back stronger." "We'll all return to the Place de la Révolution tomorrow. "And with strength of will, we'll succeed." Many people started to agree with this approach and they started leaving the site. That's when my telephone rings. It was the playwright giving me a roasting: "You're being unprofessional. "People are waiting, the play should've started... "We're an hour late! "You're not here. You've missed the sound check." I said: "Are you aware of what's going on?" "No, I don't want to know. "A professional keeps things separate, etc." It was such a big deal! If my reality had met fiction, her fiction hadn’t met any reality. It wasn't yet within her reach. She hadn't understood... Later, she understood the severity of the situation. It was true rebellion of the people. It was serious business. It was hard for her to believe that everything we'd experienced and created on the stage was happening right in front of our eyes. She was blind. Few people really believe that culture comes before change. Beyond being the change itself. They say that because it sounds good but they don't believe it. And yet... NATIONAL ASSEMBLY We haven't slept for a week. We've fueled rebellion in every neighborhood and on the UN roundabout and the Place de la Révolution. This morning we set off from the Rond Point du 2 Octobre, we rallied people to do the rounds and come back here to force the riot police to let us through. At some point, the Army will be with us and they have to. ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF OFFICE We need political commitment We need leaders who go further than cash Who go further for Africa We need leaders who see further We need leaders who have... We need political commitment We need to take risks We need someone to take risks, we need political commitment. Something like that. As soon as the kids saw Smockey, they came to him. That's sweet! Hi, kids. How's it going? Come say hello to your uncle! - Come say hello to me. Say hi to your uncle. How are you? Sweet! Fist bump. Gimme a fist bump! Our country or death? Our country or death? - We shall win. Not loud enough! Our country or death? We shall win! - That's it! That sounds more determined. What did we have previously with the Balai Citoyen? We had strong words and actions. Lots of people believed in the Balai Citoyen's message. Wasn't the revolution a strong action? - No, I mean before that. You were able to rally lots of Burkinabe citizens and even beyond that. We were expecting something better. With the revolution. At least, after the fateful day of the revolution. Whether or not I want to be, I'm a leader. Some consider me to be a leader. So, I don't want to send people's children to the slaughter. I'm no expert in politics. That's the last thing we should do. After trying everything else. I'm no expert. When we protested to get the Army on our side, the next day, Balai supporters came. They surrounded the military. They said that they were going to force entry. You were there, weren't you? - Yes, I was there. We were there with megaphones. What happened? We were walking around, and we heard that all the Army generals are inside, they were having a powwow. We exchanged words and said: "What shall we do? "Isn't it better to speak to them?" So we did. And they told us they can guarantee that Blaise will resign and they'll secure it, everything we asked for. I said: "In the meantime, who'll be in charge of operations?" In the interim. They had to decide who should be in charge. I'm not talking about a transition. I’m pointing out the basic functions of an army. The Army defends the people! They must face up to their responsibility to defend the people until the people make a decision. This is all that we saw, in all our naivety! The soldiers weren't left in peace. With Kalashnikovs! They say it's up to us to protect them. "What? Soldiers can protect themselves!" They say: "No." If we don't protect them, they don't know what can happen in the crowd. So we, members of the Balai, surrounded the guys to protect them and get them to the Place de la Nation. To address the people. My bro Sans'k came to see me and said: "Smockey, is it OK if we stand with them?" I said: "You know, we must take responsibility. "This is our commitment. "Let's do what we have to and then move on." They just dropped everything. they made their announcement, they filmed it. That's how the Balai Citoyen sold the revolution. At one point, it was a chaotic and urgent situation. We had to be on the ground. Whenever the situation commanded it, we were there. Even when we smelled a rat, we were there. Even if there were only ten of us. But the message in your lyrics was more convincing. That's not true. - It is. More convincing than which lyrics? I don't know. What's the most recent album you've heard? Which album? I always stick to the same themes, man. I don't change. Until proven otherwise, on each show, I say: "Was the government in place now voted in by popular consensus, yes or no? "Is it here as a result of transparent elections? "Did the Burkinabe people elect it?" Yes. - So, it's legitimate! Why do you want me to hit the streets and whip up a second revolution? We wanted things to be done democratically and Burkinabe people have the right to choose their own president, their representative for no more than two terms. That's what we have today. In 2020, those who aren't happy will have a vote. They'll vote for someone else. Betrayal of the rebellious mind Democracy belongs to us all Security measures - Misconduct Incompetence - Poor leadership The putsch trial... Listen, he says: "Colonial mentality. "You're a colonial man. "You were once a slave. "You've already been set free "but you've never set yourself free. "Exactly. "They do all that. "They even exaggerate what they do. Exactly. "That's why they think that they're better than their brothers." "That's right. "They don't like their own. "They prefer outsiders. That's right. "They sit in air-conditioned rooms "and they're far from their homeland. "That's right. "The judge puts on his wig and sentences his brother to jail. "That's right. "They're proud of their names while they take the names of slaves. "That's right. "Colonial mentality. Listen to me! "Colonial mentality. "Mr. Ransome, listen to me. "Mr. Guillaume, listen to me. "Mr. Mohamed, listen to me. "Mr. Anglican..." They're talking about you. Mr. Mohamed, that's you! "Mr. Anglican, listen to me. "Mr. Catholic, listen to me. "We're still in Africa, "so listen to me." I'll bet it's great. The needle needs to go much further along. That's so fucking old. I remember that. Dad used to dance to that on our terrace. The Horoya Band's second concert. That's old music. It needs moving on a little. Sir. You were born around 1938 in Bondigui. You're 44 years old, Voltaic. You're an economic affairs advisor and a Samandin resident. You're a Gounghin resident, married and the father of seven children. You've never been sentenced. My father was offered the job of minister at least twice. He refused each time. The third time, Sankara and Blaise came to the house to offer it to him and he accepted. As soon as he accepted the minister's job, anonymous letters were written, etc. So, he was brought before the TPR, the Popular Revolutionary Tribunals, to be judged. He was under house arrest for almost two years. He was given food to eat at home. And then he was found not guilty. The problem is, it really affected him. It broke him, in fact. After that, he didn't want to work in government anymore. He went back to his job at the ECOWAS before eventually retiring. And then he died. But all this broke him. It broke his family. So, they blamed... For a big part of the family, Sankara was to blame for this. That's why it's difficult to understand why I'm a Sankara supporter. For me, that's not the problem. I don't want to look through my own little individual prism, I want to look through a collective prism. And I want to believe in this man's humanity in terms of his actions, the ambitions he had for his country and the integrity he represents right up to the present day. He didn't serve his own interests. And that's enough to give me faith in the human initiative that he planned to launch. The rest of it is political games. He had to turn a blind eye to certain things. Beyond that... He's still a great man. I lived in the Zone du Bois, it's not a small neighborhood, it's swanky. Daddy's boys, daddy's girls... I was only surrounded by people like that. They tried everything to control me, but failed. Even my father has never been able to control me. Thinking about it, I'm quite proud of that. My father didn't understand. He can't understand that his son can be calm one minute and then straight out with it the next. And everyone stays calm. I don't know. I've never felt comfortable in that world. Perhaps because, in some way, I had a wider outlook. There's nothing special about material wealth. There were some remarkable things for someone of my age, but... Something wasn't right, something about these people didn't ring true. Because, they lived in an environment that they knew inside out, that they pretended not to see, because they were only interested in their own. When I look at what these people have become today, that's what I hate the most. I don't envy them at all. Even though I'm far from home, I have rights And just like you, I have rights And it's the same blood flowing in you and me In you and me. "Even though I'm far from home, I have rights. "Yes, just like you. Yes." I prefer: "And just like you." Yes, just like you... - No, the "yes" isn't a long note. You're insisting to someone that you have rights and he's surprised. "Yes, like you, I have rights too." Yes, like you I have rights instead of "and just like you." And it's the same blood flowing in you and me In you and in me. "See, I have rights!" I heard a real African, man. That was no honky. See, I have rights! - Exactly! Or we can sing it to a Patrick Bruel tune. And if I'm far away from my rights, I have a home... "And if I'm far away from my rights, I have a home." If I'm ever far away from my rights, I can always stay at home. Where I'm respected. Frantz Fanon said that man on earth is nothing if he's not slave to a cause, the cause of the people, the cause of justice, the cause of freedom. The same Frantz Fanon said that it's up to each generation to find their mission, accomplishing it or betraying it. Our leaders have betrayed us. I think that many of our leaders don't even know they're on a mission! They don't yet know that they're on a mission. But what I also wanted to say, is that migrants are also being betrayed in a way. It takes courage to face up to all this danger. It takes courage to accept all this suffering. But, at the same time, whatever people may say, it's also a form of cowardice. We must be honest. If you had the capacity to bear all this suffering to get to the other side, to cross the Mediterranean, you can stay and fight with us here, so we can change the country. Paradise is not Las Vegas, it's not Paris, it's not Hong Kong or any of the places we see on TV. Paradise is here in Burkina Faso. Always searching for tomorrow Sentenced to poverty, I hold out my hand to you Here, it's rough &amp; tough and if you want profit You must fight to put food on the table Here, it's Babylon, Baghdad, Islamabad No laws, no faith, here there is no God When we say we're together, we're in the shit We're in it together, all in the shit We're slaving, rhyming, not bragging We deal here, we kill here, there are no bonuses here If you're weak, you're dead There's no crime here When you sleep, you're dead There are no dreams here Hey family, what do you say? What are we looking for? We're waiting for a lifeline from God or his prophet Waiting for it all, nobody knows what we're waiting for But we're waiting Anyhow, we have the time They have the cash but we have the time Fine wheels Fine women They have the watches but we have the time They have the cash Fine wheels Fine women The wheel isn't turning, somebody jammed it Someone's having fun rolling the fucking dice Someone's having fun Someone's having fun rolling the fucking dice The wheel isn't turning, somebody jammed it Someone's having fun rolling the fucking dice Someone's on their way to Kosyam Palace... Is politics a game? - No! Is it a game? - No! It's on the people's shoulders. If you want to speak in French or in Moore, feel free! You have the floor tonight. You'll point out problems and together, we'll find the solutions. If you have anything to say. What's the problem with the roads in Karpala? What solutions can we suggest? And above all, how can we mobilize for Karpala? From Karpala to Rayongo, everything has been sold. The section at the back has been handed over to bigwigs who are building apartment blocks and shops. The hospital septic tanks have been there barely two weeks. They're in the open air and, when you walk past, it stinks. Can you imagine this hospital's wastewater flowing through a whole neighborhood? I was planning to ask the mayor here but, as you can see, he isn't here tonight. I was passing by and I saw the audience sitting here. I stopped to find out what was happening. I heard you discussing our neighborhood. Wherever you go, people are discussing our neighborhood, Karpala. When it rains in Karpala, you pray to God that even your worst enemy doesn't have to go there. Last time, my six meters of tarmac here was turned into the Tanghin Barrage. On Friday, an old man wearing his white prayer gown, wanted to pass by and he fell into the water. When I saw that, I cried. Apparently, we have a local mayor, but he does nothing for us. In return for our votes, he promised to resolve the problems. We voted for him and he took power. But he only looks after his own and we suffer. We should've stayed home on election day and let him fend for himself. What's the point of voting when you get up the day after to find desolation? We know it's not an easy country, but you must keep your promises in the name of your ancestors! That's all I have to say. You know, we must change. Putting on the pressure is good, but nothing has happened yet. You must be the politicians, you must go into politics. You must be the mayors, there's no competition. Those people have no faith. It's the same old parties that have been there forever. They're old parties. They're old crocodiles. You must chase them away! You must agree to take your destiny into your own hands. The young guy said it earlier. He said: "We've fought, we've put up barricades, "but we're not ready, the neighborhood must change." You must learn how to elect people in your neighborhood, people who are aware of your problems. Not people who've come from elsewhere. People who've already done something for the neighborhood. In any case, citizens from the zone. If they sort things out, it's good for them too. But here people from I don't know where, who are elected as mayors and we don't even know how they got there. And they do nothing! Because they refuse to meddle in politics. You must meddle in politics! We're here as citizens, so, we also have the right to be concerned about public issues. Someone said to me: "We must take responsibility." That's taking responsibility! There are young people, people with potential who can change this neighborhood in one year. What has this government done in almost three years? They say they've done a lot, but it's almost nothing. They're old crocodiles! That's also the truth! We need people who aren't afraid. We need commitment to change things. I want to talk about this commitment. And you need it to make sacrifices for others. Those people don't have it. Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years Against the cynical malice in the shape of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants Many gave in and certain others resisted But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood Have fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle... Security measures Misconduct. - Incompetence Poor leadership. - The putsch trial... Things have been slightly sorted out, victories have been possible, there's no reason for it to stop there. These victories must continue. And with them, they'll bring their share of changes in mentality. People will ultimately realize that nothing is already predestined, the dice have not been cast. And once they've been cast, we can cast them again. We can reconfigure the game. And it'll all be OK. Each person will approach things critically. I believe in that, I feel that. When I exchange views with people, I sense that their frustration is partly tangible but also, I sense their awareness that anything is possible. In some way, we've arrived at a point of no return. Which means that... We've just got on board, in fact. People are on the train but they don't know when we'll arrive at a station. They think that they're... I don't know what train they think they're on, but this train will arrive somewhere. That's it. I want to believe that it will stop at the right station. In one way or another, it can happen any time, anyhow. That's not important. Time is on our side. It's our strength. President Thomas Sankara Burkina Faso, An honest and worthy Faso representative A current resident of the cemetery A revolutionary butchered by a traitor His bones are resting in Dagnoen Cemetery Just as white as Nobert Zongo's Vile imperialist, sad tightrope walker Political strategists, methodical killings It's the Old Man and the Medal For our forefathers, it's chaos They don't know what to say anymore The kids of today have no respect for us citizens. But where are we? We are told to be perfect consumers They order you to speed up They order to me to capitulate We're beasts of burden mixed up with the losers And the bells ring out for freedom And the bells ring out for dignity And the bells ring out... Captain Noël Isidore Thomas Sankara More justice! We want justice! We're fed up! We're fed up! TIME IS ON OUR SIDE
