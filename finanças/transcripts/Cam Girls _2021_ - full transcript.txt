May 2020 and the coronavirus infections have now spread rapidly throughout the UK with no vaccine in sight just yet. People are being told to stay indoors, only to leave for essentials, food and drink, or one hour's daily exercise. Anyone who is seen with members of another household will find themselves with a heavy penalty. Finally people have to change with the new normal. We will have to change the way we do things, needed to insure that. What do you wanna do today? It's not the same is it? Hey, ladies. Hey, girls. Hey. So how are you all finding lockdown? I feel like it's been so long since we last caught up. Tell me about it. I'm going bored out of my mind. Must've faked tanned even more than usual. I'm just trying to say it's all we're supposed to be in Hawaii right now getting married. Oh, honey. How's Liam doing? He's still stuck abroad for work. He tried to get a flight back but the borders are still closed for coronavirus. I guess I must've deluded myself into thinking this would all be over by now. But here I am. Not married and cooped up in my house. It's weird not being in a routine, isn't it? I keep getting into autopilot. Like this morning I got up to make my coffee and thinking I was going into the office. Oh my God. Me too. I've done that so many times. Oh I miss our morning chats in the office. Oh, I do too. Yeah, I think it's gonna be a while before we get back there. You know what I'm finding the hardest though. Like not having human contact. Preach. Same. I miss my man. Well, Kelly, I actually meant not having any kind of human contact. But yeah. I just feel weirdly frustrated like I just wanna sit down and have a face-to-face conversation with someone, you know. Mm-hm. This helps though. We should do this more often especially 'cause we're all in the same situation. Locked down, alone. Girls, can I tell you something that's been on my mind? I'm really worried about money because I haven't been working at the office for very long and they said that they can't pay me what I usually earn. Have you spoken to Barbra from account? Yeah, and she said that the best they could do is 80% which won't even cover my bills. I've been trying to think of things that I could do from home but what? So I think the money situation's taken its toll on everyone, babe. Even the insurance wouldn't even cover my wedding. What do you mean? They wouldn't cover it. Said it was unforeseen circumstances. So we lost all the money. Start from scratch now. Oh my God, stop. How can they do that? I would've thought the insurance would kick in. Like, surely the only reason they wouldn't cover it is if you changed your mind or something. Nope. We lost it all. I noticed that it was one of their small print exceptions so... Okay, okay, while we're going all in with confessions, can I tell you girls something and you promise you won't judge me? After all the stories you've told us, have we ever judged you? Come on. Spill. All right, okay, this is gonna sound crazy 'cause I was meant to be getting married this week. I don't know, maybe it's last minute nerves or something like that, but... I've been thinking a lot about my ex-boyfriend recently. Like in lockdown. But before this, I very rarely thought about him at all like I might check his social media now and then but nothing like this. Like, thinking of him how? Yeah like sexually or... Both. Like what it would be like to be with him and then yeah, sometimes, when I'm alone and things start getting a bit heated in my mind, he pops up. Is he the one you climax to? Ness! I'm serious. Yeah. Is that really bad? No, I don't think so. I think it's just your mind's got a lot of time and, you know, people are just flickin' into it, that's all. I've some exes spinning around in my head. But it's usually when I can't sleep at night. Yeah, you're alone in that big house, Kelly. I mean, I just think it's normal. We've all got weird thoughts going on right now. Go on. But you can't just leave us hanging like that. Go on, what's been flitting around in your dirty mind? Well... Before lockdown, Steven and I started watching some stuff together. And it would be a crime if you didn't tell us what. Well, we were watching some raunchier videos. Unusual, that had like group and rough, things like that. I would not have thought you'd be into group. You'd be surprised. We dabbled in a threesome back in the day. It's a long time ago now. It's really only just been us since, but I don't know, recently, I just... I've been wondering if maybe he might be into some other stuff like that. I don't know. It's just hard to talk about really. Well, now's the perfect time. Isn't he away? Yeah. He's staying with his mum. I mean, it's understandable in her condition. There's no way I was spending lockdown with Steven's mum though. But yeah, he's gotta be there for her. Well, use this distance then. I always think it's so much easier to talk via text about dirty stuff. You know, you can text him what you're thinking, see how you both feel. You can explore your limits so much easier that way. Yeah, use this time. Yeah, maybe I will. Here we go. Well, that's it really. But as soon as I can, I only wanna head straight back to you. I want my hands all over you. Is that right? This must be the longest time we haven't... you know. You can just say it, you know. We're not kids anymore. I want to rip that robe off you. Listen. I need to tell you something that's been on my mind. What's up? I mean, I have to be completely honest with you 'cause without that what do we have, right? Sure. You can tell me whatever. Okay. So I'm not really sure what's been going on in my head recently but... I have Ricky on my mind a lot recently. Your ex. Yeah. Oh you... what do you mean, you have him in your head a lot lately? I don't know like... Like when I can't sleep sometimes, sometimes he'll pop into my mind. Do you miss him? No. No, I don't think I miss him. I love you. You haven't messaged him. No. God no, of course not. Sounds... very strange. I don't know how I feel about this. I just think this has been really hard for me emotionally, you know, and I think it's really easy for your mind to wander when there's not something specific that you're thinking about. You know what I mean? Right. You don't get it. Well, not usually, no. I do just feel like you could be a bit more supportive with the difficulties that I'm facing. Yeah, we're all facing difficulties, Kelly, not just you. It would be quite hot if you did mesh with some guy. I thought you said you didn't like the idea. It was weird earlier, but now when I'm horny, it's hot. Maybe not with him, your ex, but some random. I like the idea of another man inside you. Is that right? I like the idea of another man's hands all over your body. What turns you on about it? Some random guy, coming in, taking my fiance, using her. Yeah, that's hot. Type of guy would you like? I like a guy in uniform. Would you like that then? Some other guy to use you? Like a threesome? I could be there but I wouldn't wanna join. I would want to watch you. That's hot. It makes me rock hard. I'm touching myself at the idea. Want you to picture another guy in between your legs. I am. I want you to climax at the idea of another man inside you. Mm. Here we go. Wow! Honey, you look... You don't like it? No, hell no, I do, I do. It's... That's good. That's good. It's just, my mother's in the next room and she could come in at any moment. What's all this for? Well, I was thinking as I haven't seen you in a while, I've had some thoughts in my mind during this time that we've had. And I thought that maybe... Steven? Can you hear me? You're frozen. This old thing. Steven? Steven, can you hear me? You're frozen. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Fuck sake. You're frozen. Steven. Typical. Okay. Lots of things. Hey, Chanel. Hey, talk of the devil. We never expected you to be coming. I just like the idea of being watched. Hm, okay. So what do you wanna know? What can you teach me? Outfits. It's all about the outfits. I earn nearly 1,500 a month. And now just after a year, I'm earning like 4000, sometimes more a month. I just work from home, I choose my working hours, I can film whatever I want, and whenever, my body, my choice. And when you first start out it's all about content, content, content. I started with a lot of live shows, but making your viewers feel it's personal, you know, the interaction, they're getting with this girl of their dreams. They wanna feel the human interaction. And so if you can find the time to reply to them in your DMs, or you know, just go out of your way to even send a video message to him. It will keep them hooked. And you'll find yourself with a true, loyal fan base. The master and the submissive. A fun game that a lot of you secretly think about, a brilliant way of keeping your love life alive. How do you go about your first steps? Well, this video will introduce you to the beginnings of a master. Do you want to be a master? You have to find, in a safe way, what your limits are and theirs. Even when someone says they have no limits, there should always be a safe word. And as a master, it is your mission to get to them to say that word. If I tell you something, will you promise not to judge? After what I've told you what I'm doing with Steven, come on. I think I've found a quick way to earn some cash. Go on. Have you ever heard of camming? Jenna, are you sure that's something you wanna dabble in? Once you've got content online, it can get out. Yeah, but it can't come directly back to me if I change my name though, right? Well, this is juicy. What would you change your name to? Belle, Belle Summers. And not to sound patronizing, you have thought this through? You feel that this is what you wanna do to earn some extra money? Yeah. Well, I've always liked the idea of being watched. Why not mix it with work? Work and pleasure. My girl. Sign me up. Seriously though, I find it hot the idea of guys seeing me but I'm still in control. It's kind of like what you're doing, Ness. Sort of. Although that's with my husband. - I do like the idea of it. - Okay. Plus I really need the cash. Girls, I need your honest opinions. I say go for it as long as you're careful. Like changing your name, making sure you can't be traced. Yeah, I guess you've got lots of time on your hands so why not live out one of your desires. And if it's not for you, you can always close down the account. Yeah, when I registered they said they'd shut the account as soon as I ask them to. Hold on. You've already signed up? Yeah. I already posted two photos. Oh my God, Jenna, why didn't you tell us? Shit. Eh? This morning. Are you gonna go nude? No, absolutely not, no. That's something I said to myself. No nudity. Just a sort of dance show, you know. You're gonna get guys riled up doing that, Jenna. Isn't that the point? But what if they wanna see what's underneath? I guess everyone has a price, huh? No, it's not part of the fantasy for me. I like the idea of them seeing me, watching me, paying me, but no nudity, no sexual acts. So when you gonna do your first show? Tonight. Oh wow. How many subscribers have you got? I'm just over a hundred I think. So not that many but hopefully I'll get more with time. Go on, open it. I want you to put that collar on. Go on, like my little puppy. Do as I say. My mother is here. She could walk in at any moment. Do you want to be my little slave or not? I bet you wish that was you, huh? What next, Mistress? Should be another little gift in the box. Have a look. Kiss my boot. Uh uh uh. I hadn't finished. Hold your collar and pull on it choking. Hey, Miss Chelks. I got another parcel for you. Isn't there something I need to sign? Oh, oh, can you sign this for me? Sure. Thanks. I'll catch you later, yeah? What the hell? No, honestly, though, appearance is everything. Do you think they'll like it? Cute. You gotta know what your audience wants and play to that. Teach me how to do an actual cam show. Hm, okay, sit back and act as though you were my. Okay. Serious. You've gotta know what they want. Get yourself in the zone and see what turns you on. Ready? Hey, Kell. Right, the weirdest thing just happened. Go on. Liam sent me a police uniform. Random. Isn't it? Why did he send you that? I don't know. I mean, well, we had a chat the other night but I don't know... Go on. You can tell me. Come on, don't leave me hanging. Okay. So... so basically the other night, we sort of ended up sexting about me being with another guy. Oh. Really? Yeah. It was really hot. So you know how I told you about how I've been thinking about my ex? Well, I told him and then, you know, one thing led to another and yeah, we just began talking about me with another man. But then, I don't know, we haven't said a word about it since and suddenly this parcel comes today. And he texted me and he said... he said, "You love a man in uniform, right?" And you do. I'm just so confused. Are you though, really? What do you mean? Well, think about it. It's true, you do like a man in uniform. So maybe he's just initiating something so it really happens. What you think he sent me a used uniform? Maybe. One step closer to another man, eh? Oh my God. So what do you think? Don't know. It's just all a bit sudden really. I mean, I wasn't expecting anything like this. But... But... Yeah, I mean, it's kinda kinky. Yeah, just go with it. You won't know unless you try. Yeah. The idea that a man could be doing this to open them, I suddenly have an urge. You look hot. Yeah, you too. Can you smell the scent of another man? Made sure it was secondhand. You cheeky boy. I want to watch you with the scent of another man while you please yourself. I want you to picture a policeman who's just come by to check you're okay in that big house. I want you to picture the policeman being turned on. He looks you up and down. You notice then. You offer him a drink. Before you know it, he eyes you, holding his gaze longer than he should. Touching your thigh. Telling you you're beautiful. He spots the wedding ring. He doesn't care that you're married. He just wants to touch a married lady. He continues touching you. - Oh! - Again. And again. And again till he slips inside of you. Oh Oh oh. Oh. Oh. Hi, guys. Belle here. Is no one interested? Wow, thanks, guys. I'm 18. This is my first show. Thank you. Wow, that was um, that was generous of you, Mr. Pinter. What tonight, Mistress? Remember that time we had a menage a trois? Sure as hell I do. Did you enjoy me and another woman sharing you? Yes, I did. Did you enjoy it? I did. Well, it's a shame with the current situation that you can't share me with somebody else. Well, it's not about you anymore. It's about me and my desires. So sit back and watch your mistress work. Hi, Foxy-Lyne. Hello, Mistress. My little puppy is watching. Reveal yourself to your mistress. Get a load of this. You like what you see? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Mm. Ah. Shh. Shh. Well, hello there, BartyBoy. Oh. It was hot seeing you get off over the smell of another guy. You know what would be hot? Go on. Seeing you with another man for real. Would that actually turn you on? I think so. To like actually see me with another man inside me. Yeah. Maybe. Anyone in mind? Like who? Like a celebrity? Someone more realistic. Someone we know. Don't know. No one I can really think of. Anyone from my work? Um... Well, that Tared was okay. He doesn't work in the office anymore. Oh. The new postman's hot. Really? Yeah. He came to deliver something the other day and, yeah, he was hot. Would you want him inside of you? I think so. Don't hold back. Yes. If he was there now, would you let him? Yes. How would it happen? I'd invite him in for a coffee. Then? Well, I'd probably tell him how frustrated I've been, all alone in this house without my fiance here. Then? Then I'd let him kiss me. Where would you let him take you? In our bed. I'm about to order something next day delivery. Tell me when he's in the house. Ah, typical. Oh. Hey, BartyBoy. Um, how are you? Good. Do you like what you see? I wore something special for you. A request? I can pose for you if you like. I would like that. Ah. Yes. Yeah. Lucky or what? My first night on there and I literally met a guy who treats me better than any guy I've ever been with ever before. Plus he said he's gonna pay me double. Let me repeat, double what I earned last night if I don't come tonight. Oh, babe, this sounds lush. Perfect guy. I mean, he's gotta be loaded, right? Who can casually just afford 1.2K? Well, maybe he's not spending cash online like I am. He's got plenty of money to spend during lockdown. Talking of splashing in lockdown... My postman is really hot. Since when? Since I got a new one yesterday. And me and Liam have been talking more and more about the idea of another man. I'm gonna need another glass of wine for this but please don't stop. The idea of me being with another guy really turns him on. He basically asked me who I thought was hot but realistic to screw me. And you said the postman? Honestly, he's hot. No, seriously, his muscles were practically bursting through his clothes. And what did Liam say? He's ordered me a next day delivery. Told me to open it in front of him. What do you think will be in the parcel? Don't know. Guess I'll find out tomorrow. But obviously now that lockdown's starting to ease a little bit, we're allowed to see one other person, and I can't see Liam 'cause he's abroad so maybe this could be my one other contact? Well, the Dutch government have issued guidance to find a fuck buddy so, babe, maybe you found your one. What do you mean the Dutch government have told people to find a fuck buddy? They've issued guidance to single people seeking intimacy during the pandemic. They said that they should find a sex buddy. So the question is, Kelly, have Liam given you permission to fuck this guy? Well, he said he wants to know when he's in the house. This is so naughty. I love it. Well, can I just say it before I get too carried away? Look, okay, what if this a really hot idea and everything but then when it comes down to it and I actually do it, but what if he doesn't find it hot anymore, you know, and then it's too late, I've already done it? Well, you've just gotta trust that if he says he's fine with it, he'll be fine with it. You've done this before, haven't you, Nessa? What was it like for you? Well, Steven and I have got a very trusting relationship so it was fine for us. And it's fine too being in a monogamous relationship. I'm not gonna lie, I really enjoyed sharing another girl with him. We always refer back to it. I was so, I just got this jealousy when she had him before me and I loved it too. It just, something inside me just made me wanted to control him. I think we fucked every day from then on. But, as Ness said, it isn't for everyone. Yeah, it's tricky. I mean, Steve and I are in a longterm marriage. It's gonna get stale after nearly a decade of being together. I've only been with two guys before him. So I haven't really experienced men properly. I always say this. I think I met him too early. Like, if I'd met him a little later, I could've gotten out all the urges on my own maybe. Oh, I don't know. I guess there's always something in me that wants to explore and him too. What I'm trying to say is that it's not always for everyone. You've just gotta make sure that you're extremely comfortable with it and with him. So the question is, are you? Yeah, I mean, I think so. How would you feel about him being inside another lady? Oh God. I've not really thought about that one. But you've thought about it the other way around, you being with a man. Yeah. I mean, when I'm alone, I still think about other people. But that's normal, right? Of course it's normal. We're not put on this earth to just mate with one other person. We're supposed to have sex with many. It's in our blood. Don't feel bad because you don't wanna bang his brains out all the time. It's normal to have urges for other people, other men, and if you're like me, other women too. I wanna do it. I'm just scared. I don't wanna lose him, you know. You've just gotta decide what's right for you, for you and him. Only you will know, babe. But, you know, you'll probably know tomorrow when the postman comes. I mean, I guess I wouldn't be breaking any lockdown restrictions. I heard on the news earlier you're allowed to socialize with one person from another household. You just need to ask yourself is he the one person you want to mix with during lockdown? Hey, Miss Chelks, I got another parcel for you. Great. Thanks. Now can you sign this for me? Sure. Thanks. Ready to snap my photo? Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's good. Well, I'll catch you later, yeah? Hey. Help me with something? Sure. Two sugars was it? Yeah, that's the one. Nice and sweet. Just how I like it. You do know we shouldn't be this close with the lockdown and all. Well, we're here now. I haven't left my house in weeks so... I've been seeing people every day. Yeah, but I'm sure you're careful, aren't you? You're wearing anti-bag, wearing gloves. And I always sing "Happy Birthday" twice. You cheeky fucker. So what's in the package? Oh. Not gonna use that. And it's worse for me. What you got? Shit. I shouldn't have asked. No, it's fine. I wasn't expecting it to arrive so quickly. I am sure I've delivered plenty of those over the last few weeks. Oh, I'm sure you have. There's a lot of frustrated energy out there. Yeah. A lot of people, alone in their houses. Nothing to do, time to kill. Can really build up, you know. Can really make a woman desire out-of-the-box things. Like what? Men in uniform. You didn't need my help with anything, do you? Sorry? There's nothing here for me to do is there? You don't need help with anything. Oh no, I need help. I assure you. With what? Oh God. Yes. Oh, oh. Oh yes. It was insane. I can't stop thinking about it. Like this huge weight of sexual fantasy's been lifted from my head. This is so scandalous. I love it. What did Liam say? Oh, he loved it. It really turned him on. He wanted every single detail. So, are you gonna do it again? Well, Liam's already ordered another next day delivery so... This is amazing. Okay, Jenna, your turn. How is it your end with your webcam show? Did you show him your body? And don't you lie. No. It's really weird though. Like we actually have like a genuine connection, like really. So we're meeting. Wait, sorry, actually meeting? Yeah. You're meeting a guy off a cam girl site? Don't you think that's a bit dangerous? What if he's got the virus? No. He's fine. I even asked him. He said he's virus-free, so... We've been talking for hours now and I've seen a few photos. It'll be fine. We've been talking probably more than I talk to most people that I meet off the internet for dates. Like, I feel like I know him. If you're sure. I am. You can meet people in the most unusual places. But, I'll keep you updated. Speak to you, girls. Do I or don't I? Well, hey there, Belle. So what's up, Belle? I'm... You look so different. Yeah, the photos were old. Okay. So can I come in? It's still me, BartyBoy. No, sorry. I don't know what you thought was gonna happen, but you're not the photos. You're not you. So no. Um... you should have the confidence to just be you, you know. Okay, have a good one. So what time will you be home to your mistress tomorrow? Around midday. Good. I'll be waiting. Are you ready to experience the full power of your mistress? I am. I am what? Mistress. Fantasy over for Belle. What do you mean it wasn't him? Catfish. You were right but whatever. It wasn't for me. You know, the fantasy of being watched by others is over for me. I get the excitement but, yeah, it just wasn't for me in the end. Well, speak for yourself. I'm waiting for my fantasy to turn up with my package. Well, both of my packages. And I'm waiting for my little puppy to come home to his master. It's all about trying things out, seeing what your comfort zones are. You won't know until you try. And instead of letting things dry up, they can fire up. I think people just need to be more open, more adventurous. That way, everyone could have more fun with their sex lives. It's all about trying things out, seeing what your comfort zones are. You won't know until you try and instead of letting things get dried up, keep them fired up. I think people need to be more open, more willing. They could have so much better sex lives. Things have changed. Attitudes have changed. We can't go back to how things were not after your freedom has been chained up for weeks. This is a new normal now. We've adapted and this is how we face the future.
