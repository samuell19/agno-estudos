[instrumental music] You better slow down, Fred. I hear they've been givin' out a lot of speedin' tickets on this road. Relax, Barn, the cop on the speed 'is an old army buddy of mine.' [car revving] [siren wailing] Boy, are you gonna get it. So? It's a living. Well, you and your army buddy are gonna have a lot to talk about. Here he comes. Hi, Alex. Long time no see. The name's not Alex, mister. It's Belinda. Now, let's see your driver's license. [stammering] Yes, ma'am. What's this world comin' to, Barn when the police department starts hirin' lady cops? But women are into everything nowadays, Fred. Nothing's sacred anymore. (Fred) Yeah, well, I'm just thankful Wilma and Betty enjoy bein' housewives. (Barney) Yeah, amen to that, Fred.

'Fred still thinks a woman's place is in the home.' (Betty) 'Barney's more liberal.' He thinks a women's place is in the kitchen. [laughing] [instrumental music] Uh, two pounds. That'll be 120 clams, Mrs. Flintstone. Imagine, 120 clams for a two-pound melon. Inflation is getting ridiculous. Yeah. It's a crime. You're right, lady. This is a crime. Yeah, stick 'em up, everybody. Oh, it's a hold-up. (male #1) 'Right again, lady.' 'Put the swag in the bag, buster.' Uh, ye-yes, sir. Hey! That's my money. I just gave it to him. Now we got it. [laughing] (Betty) 'Some nerve.' Ooh! Now I'm mad. whoosh [chirping] - Wilma, you hit them. - Oh, my! (Barbara) This is Barbara Walvak at a local supermarket where Bedrock housewife, Wilma Flintstone today KO'd two escaping bandits with a perfectly-aimed melon. Mrs. Flintstone, can you tell us how you did this? Oh-oh, oh, gee, I-I'm really not sure. Can you give us a demonstration? Oh, I couldn't do it again. Try to hit that stop sign on the corner with this melon. 'It's about 100 feet from here.' Well, okay. whoosh Oh, dear, I hit it. That's truly amazing, Mrs. Flintstone. Where did you learn that? Well, I really don't know. Oh, my. I didn't realize it was so late. Come on, Betty. We better get going. I can hear Fred now. "Wilma, I'm home! What's for dinner?" (Fred) Wilma, I'm home! What's for dinner? (Wilma) 'Dinosaur omelet, Fred.' Be ready in a minute. And remember, no lumps. "And rember, no lumps." No respect, no respect. Wilma, you'll never guess what happened to me this afternoon. 'This cop stops me.' 'And I thought it was my friend Alex, see.' Only it turns out to be.. [Dino barking] Dino, no, no, no, no. 'Down, would you.. No, Dino.' Wilma! crash slurp (Wilma) 'Dino, stop.' [fanfare music] Uh! What was the attendance of our last game, Tommy? Two hundred and ten. Two hundred and eight were Boy Scouts who got in free. The other two were your mother and my mother. They paid. Yeah, we better come up with something or we're in big trouble. (Barbara) 'And here's a replay of that amazing throw.' 'What an aim!' - Hey, she's pretty good. - Eh, lucky. [buzzes] It would be a good idea for the cellar-dwelling Dodgers to hire Wind-Up Wilma as a pitcher. Uh, who needs a.. (both) Lady pitcher! Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Tommy? Yeah, we'd have the only woman pitching in the major leagues. There'd be standing room only in every game. Let's go see this Wind-Up Wilma. I hope she's not ugly. Gee, baseball players are weird. ♪ Oh this is the way we clean our rugs ♪ ♪ Clean our rugs clean our rugs ♪ Ah, good, she's home. Ring the bell. [bell rings] Coming. Stay here, Pebbles. [chuckles] Mrs. Flintstone, I'm Charlie Finrock owner of the Bedrock Dodgers. And I'm Tommy Lashael, the manager. We wanna speak with you. [Dino barking] Stop it, Dino, or no supper. [kissing] - Come in, gentlemen. - Thanks, ma'am. Now, what can I do for you? Well, uh, we saw how you bagged those crooks on TV. Oh! That was just an accident. I couldn't believe it when I hit that sign. (Charlie) 'Oh! Don't kid us.' We're ready to offer you a try-out as a relief pitcher for the Bedrock Dodgers. How about it? Oh, I'm sorry, I don't follow football. 'What's a relief pitcher?' (both) Baseball, Mrs. Flintstone. (Wilma) 'Oh! Uh, I don't follow baseball either.' (Charlie) 'Mrs. Flintstone' if you can throw a baseball like you threw that melon we will pay you 1000 clams a game. 'Plus, a 5000-clam bonus at the end of the season.' Oh, my. That's a lot of money. I'll have to talk it over with my husband first. Of course, and if he agrees be at the stadium tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. Oh, I'm sure he'll say yes. No, no, absolutely not, Wilma. A woman's place is in the home. You gotta take care of Pebbles, and cook and clean house. 'And do the shoppin'.' [bleating] - But, Fred.. - Don't "But, Fred" me. In fact, yesterday I got a ticket from a lady cop. If she was home where she was supposed to be I wouldn't have got that ticket. (Wilma) 'But, Fred, Mr. Finrock is going to pay me' 'a 1000 clams a game.' I don't care if he pays.. A 1000 clams a game? Plus, a 5000-clam bonus. [stammering] A 5-5000-clam bonus? 'Isn't that nice?' Oh-h! [rooster crowing] Oh, Fred, I have to leave now. [Pebbles cooing] Uh, Pebbles, what are you doin' here? [cooing] I'm going to the stadium, Fred. Stadium? What stadium? The baseball stadium, remember? - Five thousand clams. - 'Oh, yeah.' Now don't forget, Pebbles' diapers need changing. Breakfast is on the stove. And Dino hasn't been fed. But this is my day off, Wilma. I was gonna play golf with Barney. I know, Fred, and you're a dear to help me out. Don't worry, Pebbles. There's no way a woman can pitch in the big leagues. Wilma will be home before lunch. [instrumental music] (Tommy) 'No, no, Mrs. Flintstone.' Face this way, towards the catcher. Oh, there you are. What do you want me to do with this ball, Mr. Lashael? Just throw it into the catcher's glove. Oh, is that all? Uh, uh, where is the catcher's glove? I think I'll kill myself. Hold your glove up, Rocky. This is the catcher's glove, Mrs. Flintstone. Oh, I see it. Strike! She's a gold mine, Tommy. If she can pitch like that consistently we're in business. [drum roll] (Rocky) 'Strike!' Was that alright, Mr. Finrock? Ten perfect pitches is better than alright. It's fantastic. You're another Don Byrock. Now all you gotta do is sign on the dotted line and we'll all be rich. Well, maybe I oughta talk it over with my husband first. Oh, your husband will love it. Especially the 5000 clams. 'You're right.' (Finrock) 'Congratulations, Mrs. Flintstone.' You know, Barn, I'm really worried. If Wilma gets that pitchin' job I'll be doin' so much babysittin' and cookin' and housekeepin', I'll never have time to play golf. [bird sneezes] (Barney) 'Yeah, I'm worried too, Fred.' I'll never find a golfin' partner who loses as much as you. [laughs] [sneering] - Very funny, very funny. - 'Yeah, I thought so too.' (Frank) Hello, Mr. Flintstone. May I speak with you? Hey, Barn, it's our new neighbor, Frank Frankenstone. Oh, uh, hiya, Frankie. Well, pal, what can I do for ya? Oblivia and I have a few errands to run. And we wondered if you'd mind looking after the little ones 'for a short while.' Why, certainly, Frank. What are neighbors for except to be neighborly? [laughs] Oh, Frankenstub. Oh, Hidea. (Stubby) 'Coming, daddy.' How can you say no to a guy seven feet tall with bolts in his neck? Don't be a bother now, kiddie. (Stubby) 'We won't, daddy.' - Hi, Mr. Flintstone. - Hi, Mr. Rubble. - Oh, hiya, kids. - Hiya, kids. [barking] (Fred) 'Down, boy, down.' Will you take it easy, Creepy legs? Heel, heel! thud [birds chirping] [Creepy barking] Dino, no, not in the house! Pebbles is sleepin'. Creepy legs, come back here. Come on, Barn, we gotta stop them before they wake Pebbles. [Creepy and Dino barking] clatter [revving] Oh, Fred, I'm home. 'I did it, I did it.' I'm the new relief pitcher for the Bedrock Dodgers. - Congratulations, Wilma. - Yeah, that's great. [Fred mumbling] (Wilma) 'What's the matter with Fred?' (Barney) 'He had to babysit the Frankenstone kids.' (Betty) 'And Creepy chased Dino into the house.' [barking] Aww, that poor dear. Fred, Fred. If everything works out, we can afford a maid and a cook and you won't have to do anything. [mumbling] Uh, did you hear that, Betty? You better start practicin' your pitchin'. [laughs] Mr. Finrock said I should get a good night's sleep for the big game tomorrow. What big game? Against the Lava Town Graveliers. And I'm so nervous. I just know I won't sleep a wink all night. We gotta run, Wilma. Barney's got a golf game first thing in the morning. Yeah, so long, Fred, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, see you tomorrow. Wilma? [instrumental music] [Wilma snoring] "Won't sleep a wink all night," huh? Oh, boy. (Fred) 'You know, guys, I have the sinkin' feelin'' 'that our lives are in for a big change.' Five thousand clams or not, it ain't worth it. - Right? - Right. We've gotta think of a way to get Wilma back home where she belongs, right? - Right. - 'I got it.' If Wilma doesn't get enough sleep tonight then she'll be too tired to play tomorrow, right? - Right. - Right. [Fred whistling] Talk about sleepin' like a rock. Shee. [snoring continues] Looks like I'll have to go right for the maternal jugular. 'Okay, Pebbles, hit it.' [crying] Nothin'. Okay, Pebbles, it didn't work. 'You can stop cryin' now.' [cooing] Yeah, I gotta think of somethin' else. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Sheesh. They oughta get a night owl for this job. Boy, 2 o'clock in the mornin', and I tried everythin'. I guess I'll have to pull out all the stops. Dino, come here, boy. Wanna sleep in a big bed tonight? - Who me? - 'Yeah, you.' Sleep tight, Dino. [snoring] Okay, Dino, knock it off! [snoring continues] thud Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. [snoring] plop plop plop Wilma, what are you doin' up so early? 'Oh, the kitchen faucet is dripping, and it woke me up.' The faucet was drippin'? 'Yes, you know what a light sleeper I am.' [groans] Wake up, Fred, I have to be at the stadium early and Pebbles needs to be fed. [snoring] (Wilma) 'Fred?' Yeah? Wha-wh-wh.. How do I look, Fred? 'I like you better in an apron.' Oh, don't be silly, Fred. Whoever heard of the baseball player wearing an apron? mwah Don't forget to watch the game on TV. Okay, Wilma. [yawning] [snoring] [Pebbles cooing] [fanfare music] (male announcer) 'It's the bottom of the ninth inning, folks.' And amazingly enough, the Bedrock Dodgers are actually beating the Lava Town Graveliers, 3-2. Oh, they're in deep trouble now. The base is loaded and two out. 'Manager Tommy Lashael has pulled his starting pitcher.' 'And the crowd is waiting anxiously' 'to see who the replacement will be.' [crowd cheering] 'The crowd goes wild' 'as Wind-Up Wilma goes to the mound.' 'This is the moment the fans have been waiting for.' This is history in the making, ladies and gentlemen but wait, look who's coming to the plate. 'It's the toughest, meanest' 'ugliest, strongest hitter of all.' 'A player who has never been struck out.' 'Man-Mountain Mean.' [growls] Good luck, Wilma. (Man-Mountain Mean) Just a minute, lady, I need a new bat. [grunts] Yeah, that's more like it. [growls] Oh, my. Come on, lady, play ball. Yes, sir. Yoo-hoo! Wilma! Get a touchdown for me. (Wilma) Oh, hi, Betty. How do I look in my new uniform? 'Darling. Just darling.' Oh, boy. "How do I look in my new uniform?" thud Strike one! Attaway, Wilma! Strike the bum out. Hey, Fred, I thought you wanted Wilma to lose. Oh, yeah, that's right. Knock the next one out of the ballpark, Mean! We want Wilma back home. You were lucky, lady. thud thud But I'll be ready this time. Wind-Up Wilma gets set. 'She winds up, and here's the pitch.' What the.. Strike two! Thattaway, Wilma! Two down, one to go! Touchdown! Touchdown! This is it, ladies and gentlemen. 'The 0 and 2 pitch to Man-Mountain Mean.' vroom (male #2) 'Strike three! You're out!' - Hurray! - We did it! (male announcer) Man-Mountain Mean goes down looking. Wind-Up Wilma has struck him out. The Bedrock Dodgers win it, 3-2. (in unison) Yabba-dabba-doo! That's it, Wilma! Good goin', baby, good. Mrs. Flintstone, how does it feel to be an overnight celebrity? Well, it's wonderful. This is the biggest thrill of my life. Hey, pal, you're steppin' on my foot. Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Flintstone's husband. "Mrs. Flintstone's husband?" My name is Fred Flintstone, pal. F-R-E-D, Fred. You got that? Oh, boy, it's gonna be tough to be a celebrity's husband. How about another demonstration of your famous wind-up for our television viewers? - Oh, well, I-I don't know. - Oh, come on. 'You wouldn't want to disappoint your fans, would you?' No, I suppose not. Oh, poor Fred. He's taking this hard. All I do is.. Ouch! - What's wrong? - My arm. There's a terrible pain in my arm. What? We better get you to a hospital. No, no, no. I'll have my husband take me. Boy, it's a good thing Pebbles is asleep. She'd be worried if she knew Wilma was in a hospital. Oh! Dino, when I need a shadow, I'll call you. - 'Hi, Fred.' - Wilma. [barking] - Are you alright? - Yes, Fred. The doctor says I have a severe case of Pitcher's Elbow. And that I probably won't be able to pitch again. I hope you're not too disappointed. Disappointed? Are you kiddin', Wilma? Me and Pebbles are glad to have you back. Mama. Mama. [Dino barking] [laughs] And so is Dino. [kissing] [chuckles] Oh, thanks, Dino. Come on, let's go home, I'm starved. Stop at the supermarket, Fred, and we'll get you a snack. (Fred) 'Boy, I can't wait to sink my teeth' into one of those thick, juicy brontosaurus steaks smothered with mushrooms. (male #3) 'Stop! Thief! Stop!' 'Call the police. We've just been robbed!' Hold it, buddy. I got a black belt in karate. Yeah? Well, I got two of them, buddy. Of all the nerve. thud crash (Fred) Great shot, Wilma! - Your pitchin' arm. - Oh, what? Your Pitcher's Elbow suddenly got better. Eh? Oh. I guess I forgot about the pain in all the excitement. There's nothin' wrong with your elbow, is there, Wilma? Well, actually, Fred, no. You mean you sacrificed your career for us? Yes, Fred. I'd rather have you and Pebbles than a career any day. Wilma, you're the greatest. Alright, who clobbered this crook? Oh, that lady over there, she hit him with a melon. 'Oh, boy, has she got a great arm.' Let's get out of here, Fred. You said it, Wilma. Come on. (Fred) 'Yabba-dabba-doo!' [theme music]
