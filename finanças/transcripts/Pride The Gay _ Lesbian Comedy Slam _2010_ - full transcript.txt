[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHOO! >> MY NAME IS TIGER WOODS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAD NO IDEA THAT PLAYING 18 HOLES WOULD CAUSE SO MUCH TROUBLE.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> I MEAN, I WALK IN, DRESSED LIKE THIS. I'M LIKE, &quot;HEY, WHAT'S UP?&quot; THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;I DON'T THINK SO.&quot; THEY'RE BLOWING THE RAPE WHISTLE. [ IMITATES WHISTLE ] [ LAUGHTER ] CUT TO FOUR LESBIANS KICKING THE SHIT OUT OF ME. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> AS SOON AS WE HAVE SEX, LET THE CODEPENDENCY BEGIN. THAT IS IT. [ LAUGHTER ] LESBIANS ARE LIKE STAMPS -- ONCE YOU LICK THEM, THEY STICK. THAT IS IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> LIVE FROM THE EL PORTAL THEATER IN NOHO, CALIFORNIA, WITH PRIDE, IT'S &quot;THE GAY AND LESBIAN COMEDY SLAM.&quot; [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND NOW PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE A HOLLYWOOD LEGEND, BRUCE VILANCH. >> GOOD EVENING. I'M CHASTITY BONO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M IN TRANSITION. I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR CHAZ BONO MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE... BY HER MOTHER... WHO I'VE WORKED FOR. I MEAN, I'VE WRITTEN FOR HER FOREVER. YOU SEE, I DON'T REALLY DO THIS. I WRITE FOR PEOPLE. I MEAN, I WROTE FOR CHER WITH SONNY, CHER WITHOUT SONNY, &quot;SONNY, I HATE YOU, BUT I'M WITH YOU ANYWAY&quot; CHER, &quot;CHER, I NEED THE MONEY, AND I'M WITH YOU NOW&quot; SONNY, &quot;CHER, LET'S GET TOGETHER FOR THE HELL OF IT AND LET'S NOT&quot; SONNY -- ALL OF THEM. I'VE DONE ALL OF THEM. IN FACT, THE MOST RECENT TIME, I CAME INTO THE REHEARSAL, AND I LOOKED AT HER, AND SHE SAID, &quot;VILANCH, YOU FAT FUCK. YOU STILL IN THE BUSINESS?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A GAY MAN DO A CHER IMPRESSION. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I LOOKED AT HER, AND I SAID, &quot;I LIKE THIS FACE. KEEP THIS ONE.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, PIECES OF HER FALL OFF LIKE THE HUBBARD GLACIER. SHE CALVES. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SHE'D BE HERE TONIGHT, BUT THEY'RE SPACKLING ON HER LEFT CHEEK. THERE ARE LANE CLOSURES BETWEEN THE NOSTRIL AND THE UPPER LIP. AND I KNOW 'CAUSE I WAS JUST ON A GAY CRUISE, AND WE WATCHED THE GLACIER GO, AND THERE WAS SOME QUEEN SAYING, &quot;OH, MY GOD, IT'S CHER FROM '78! THERE SHE GOES!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS JUST ON A GAY CRUISE. I DID 10 DAYS ON THE CRYSTAL METH. [ LAUGHTER ] I SEE YOU KNOW HER. AND WE WERE IN ALASKA. HAVE YOU BEEN TO ALASKA? OH, MAN. SARAH PALIN HAS MUCH TO ANSWER FOR. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, I GOT UP IN THE MORNING AND WENT OUT ONTO THE DECK OF, YOU KNOW, MY LAVISH VERANDA -- STARK NAKED, OF COURSE -- AND THERE WAS THIS HUGE HIGH-RISE NEXT TO THE SHIP, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS ODD 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY BUILT VERTICALLY. AND IT WAS ANOTHER SHIP. IT WAS THE HOLLAND AMERICA, A LESBIAN CRUISE, THE DENTAL DAM. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, YOU KNOW HER, TOO. THEY HAD DOCKED NEXT TO US, AND THERE WAS A NAKED LESBIAN. WELL, SHE WASN'T NAKED. SHE WAS JUST A LESBIAN. AND SHE WAS -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE WAS CLOTHED -- WHO CAN TELL? AND SHE WAS STANDING ON HER DECK, AND SHE KIND OF LOOKED OVER, AND SHE SAID, &quot;'HOLLYWOOD SQUARES'!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I THOUGHT, &quot;WHAT A THOUGHTFUL LESBIAN,&quot; 'CAUSE I, YOU KNOW, WAS NEVER NAKED BELOW THE WAIST IN THE SQUARE, BUT SHE RECOGNIZED ME. MOST OF THE TIME NOW, WHEN I GET RECOGNIZED, THEY THINK I'M MICHAEL MOORE -- BIG QUEEN WITH THE FAKE BLOND HAIR, MICHAEL MOORE. OR I STILL GET -- IN SAN FRANCISCO, I STILL GET JERRY GARCIA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY COME BY, AND THEY SAY, &quot;DUDE, YOU'RE BACK!&quot; IT'S VERY EXCITING. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, THIS IS A THRILL TO BE HERE. I MEAN, WE ARE HERE ON THIS GAY-AND-LESBIAN COMEDY SHOW. &quot;LES&quot; BE GAY TOGETHER. WHOO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND IT'S SO EXCITING FOR ME TO COME TO THE VALLEY. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAD MY VISA RENEWED JUST TO COME OVER THE HILL... [ LAUGHTER ] ...TO NORTH HOLLYWOOD, OR, AS IT'S NOW CALLED, &quot;NOHO.&quot; IT WASN'T CALLED THAT WHEN I LIVED HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;ONE MO HO&quot; IS WHAT IT WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GOTTEN VERY UPSCALE. I MEAN, THEY'RE PUTTING THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS IN THIS HOTEL. AND I WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL WITH ONE OF THE OTHER COMICS WHO FLEW IN FROM NEW YORK, AND WE WERE CHECKING IN. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE, A VERY PISSY HOTEL, AND WHEN YOU GO STAY IN A PISSY HOTEL, YOU HAVE FRIENDS IN TOWN, AND THEY HAVE A GIFT SHOP IN THE HOTEL. BECAUSE IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAPPED IN THE HOTEL AND HAVE TO GO OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS IN TOWN AND YOU'VE GOT TO BRING SOMETHING. AND I WAS LOOKING AROUND THERE, AND EVERYTHING IS JUST HIDEOUS. THERE'S A JAPANESE WOMAN STANDING THERE, HOLDING A CERAMIC CAT. THE UGLIEST PUSSY I HAVE EVER SEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAVE SEEN ONE. AND AS SHE IS EXAMINING THIS CAT, SHE FARTS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT HAPPENS. AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE FARTED SOMEPLACE WHERE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE FARTED OR YOU'VE BEEN DETECTED? [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT WAS JUST TOO LARGE A FART FOR IT TO GO UNNOTICED BY OTHERS IN THE GIFT SHOP, BECAUSE THERE WAS FROST FORMING ON THE GLASS, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, YOU KNOW, SHE TRIED TO COVER HERSELF, AS ONE DOES WHEN ONE HAS, YOU KNOW, CREATED THIS ATMOSPHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO THE CLERK WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HER, YOU KNOW. AND SO, SHE KIND OF LOOKED AT HIM, AND, LIKE, WITH PANIC IN HER EYES, SHE SAID, &quot;HOW MUCH IS THIS?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE SAID, &quot;LADY, IF YOU FARTED WHEN YOU PICKED IT UP, YOU'RE GONNA SHIT WHEN I TELL YOU WHAT IT COSTS.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, THEY CAN'T ALL BE GAY JOKES. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU? [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I REALLY AM EXCITED TO BE HERE, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A DIVERSE GROUP. NOW, I KNOW THAT WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA, BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING US ALL OVER THE PLACE HAVE PROBABLY NOT HAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE HAD THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WE HAD GAY MARRIAGE FOR A WHILE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES. AND WE WILL HAVE IT AGAIN. I MEAN, IT WILL COME BACK, WE KNOW. [ LOUD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND SO -- BUT WHILE WE HAD GAY MARRIAGE -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE I HAD -- PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE, LIKE, COMING OUT HERE TO GET MARRIED AND GO TO DISNEYLAND. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOES HAND IN HAND. &quot;LET'S CONSUMMATE OUR LOVE AND TAKE THE WILD TEACUP RIDE!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] SO, AND THEY WERE COMING, AND THEY WERE GETTING MARRIED OUT HERE, YOU KNOW. AND WE WERE -- LIKE, PEOPLE ARRIVING WHO HAD NEVER BEEN TO A GAY WEDDING. THE CONCEPT OF A GAY WEDDING WAS SOMETHING THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY ASSIMILATE. SO THEY WERE, FRANKLY, CONCERNED. THEY DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. AND I BEGAN GETTING LOTS OF QUESTIONS LIKE, &quot;HOW DO WE BEHAVE AT A GAY WEDDING? WHAT DO WE DO? WHAT DO WE NOT DO? WHAT'S THE PROTOCOL?&quot; SO A BUNCH OF US WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ARE GETTING TOGETHER, AND WE'RE PUTTING OUT A MANUAL SO THAT WHEN IT'S LEGALIZED AGAIN, YOU CAN JUST SEND THIS OUT TO YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY ARRIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE JUST -- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU AGREED WITH. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS IMPERATIVE AT A GAY WEDDING THAT THERE BE AN OPEN BAR THROUGHOUT THE CEREMONY... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ...FOR THE PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT IS CONSIDERED VERY BAD FORM AT A GAY WEDDING FOR EITHER OF THE PARTNERS TO HAVE DATED THE PRIEST. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL COSTS OF A GAY WEDDING ARE BORNE BY THE FATHER OF THE BOTTOM. [ LAUGHTER ] IF IT'S A LESBIAN WEDDING, THE COSTS ARE BORNE BY THE MOTHER OF THE GIRLY ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] IF THERE IS NO GIRLY ONE... [ LAUGHTER ] ...AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE... SIMPLE ARM WRESTLING WILL SETTLE EVERYTHING. SO... [ LAUGHS ] WELL, WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ONLY SHARE ONE THING, WHICH IS THEIR GAYNESS. BUT YOU WILL BE AMAZED BECAUSE THEY COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. IN FACT, THE FIRST COMIC I'M BRINGING OUT DOESN'T EVEN COME FROM A WALK OF LIFE. HE COMES FROM A MINCE OF LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WE'VE BEEN ON MANY, MANY GAY CRUISES TOGETHER, AND YOU HAVE SEEN HIM ON TELEVISION IN &quot;UGLY BETTY.&quot; YEAH. WE WERE IN A MOVIE TOGETHER CALLED &quot;YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN.&quot; HE'S QUITE FANTASTIC, AND I WOULD WATCH HIM WITH YOU, BUT &quot;HAPPY PONY&quot; IS ON, AND I'M NOT MISSING &quot;HAPPY PONY.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND ALEC MAPA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> WELL, NO, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. YEAH, YOU WANT TO BE THE &quot;BEST&quot; OF ANYTHING, RIGHT? YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BE A GAY COMIC. YOU WANT TO BE THE GAY COMIC. YOU KNOW, IT'S SO FUNNY. IT'S KIND OF LIKE -- I TALK ABOUT SEX, BUT I DON'T THINK OF MY ACT AS DIRTY, 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK SEX IS DIRTY. AND I THINK THAT IF I'M APPROACHING IT FROM A GOOD-NATURED, &quot;LET'S ALL LAUGH AT IT&quot; POINT OF VIEW, THEN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WILL TAKE THE DIRTY OUT OF IT. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT IS DIRTY. MAYBE I'M JUST DELUDING MYSELF. WELL, I CAN'T EVER CONVINCE ANYBODY, LIKE, WHO ISN'T GAY THAT BEING GAY OR GAY MARRIAGE WOULD BE A GOOD THING. BUT I COULD ARGUE ON THE FACT THAT I WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED JUST LIKE HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED. I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR RELIGION. I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM, BUT I THINK THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON ALL PEOPLE BEING EQUAL, AND UNTIL THAT CHANGES, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GONNA GO AWAY. I MEAN, EVEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE HAVE GAY PEOPLE [LAUGHS] IN THEIR FAMILIES. I MEAN, DICK CHENEY HAD A LESBIAN DAUGHTER! YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE -- THAT'S WHERE ALL THE GAY PEOPLE COME FROM. THEY KEEP MAKING THEM. NO, WE WERE PERFORMING ON THE CRUISES TOGETHER, AND I ALWAYS SAID, &quot;YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON A GAY CRUISE WHEN THE HEADLINERS ARE DEBBIE REYNOLDS, BRUCE VILANCH, AND YOU.&quot; [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY! WHAT'S UP, BITCHES? HELLO! OH... HI. HOW ARE YOU? LOOK AT ALL OF YOU. GOOD EVENING, AND WELCOME TO THE ASIAN-PACIFIC PORTION OF TONIGHT'S MULTICULTURAL PROGRAM. MY NAME IS TIGER WOODS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAD NO IDEA THAT PLAYING 18 HOLES WOULD CAUSE SO MUCH TROUBLE. [ LAUGHS ] STRAIGHT PEOPLE SUCK AT BEING MARRIED. [ LAUGHTER ] NO WONDER THEY DON'T WANT US TO HAVE IT. I MEAN, IF TIGER WOODS, THE MASTER OF HAND-EYE COORDINATION, CAN'T GET THIS RIGHT, YOU KNOW... [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOD. HELLO! JUST KIDDING. IT'S ME, ALEC MAPA, AMERICA'S &quot;GAYSIAN&quot; SWEETHEART. IT'S NOT GEORGE TAKEI. IT'S ME. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE TRIED TO STEAL MY THUNDER A WHILE BACK, AND I SAID, &quot;LISTEN, SULU...&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;...YOU WANTED TO BE QUEEN OF THE PACIFIC RIM, YOU SHOULD HAVE COME OUT 35 YEARS AGO.&quot; [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NOT LIKE IT WOULD HAVE HURT YOUR CAREER. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, SHUT UP. SHE CAN TAKE IT. SHE'S FAMILY NOW. GEORGE TAKEI CAME OUT. I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG FREAKIN' DEAL IS. FIRST OF ALL, IS THERE ANYTHING GAYER THAN &quot;STAR TREK&quot;? [ LAUGHTER ] THE ENTIRE CREW WORE BELL-BOTTOM CAPRI PANTS AND GO-GO BOOTS, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEIR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER WAS A BLACK WOMAN WITH A BEEHIVE AND A RED MINISKIRT. &quot;OKAY!&quot; AND EVERY TIME A DOOR OPENED AND CLOSED ON THAT SHIP, IT SOUNDED LIKE A BUNCH OF QUEENS FARTING IN FIRE ISLAND, YOU KNOW? &quot;WSSHHHHT!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN THEIR WEAPONS WERE GAY. THEY DIDN'T HAVE GUNS. THEY HAD [effeminately] PHASERS. [ LAUGHTER ] PHASERS. [ Normal voice ] AND IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO KILL SOMEBODY, YOU COULD SET YOUR PHASER ON [effeminately] STUN. [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;I'M NOT GONNA KILL YOU. I'M GONNA STUN YOU.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;I'M STUNNING.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] [ Normal voice ] DO YOU LIKE THE OUTFIT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU LIKE THIS? THIS IS A COSTUME I WORE ON A RECENT &quot;DATELINE&quot; SPECIAL ABOUT CATHOLIC INTERNET PREDATORS. [ LAUGHTER ] >> OWW! >> I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH. LET'S JUST SAY MONSIGNOR CUMMINGS WON'T BE IM'ing ANYBODY ANYTIME SOON. SO EXCITED TO BE HERE TONIGHT. I JUST GOT BACK FROM EUROPE. MY HUSBAND AND I JUST GOT BACK FROM BARCELONA, 'CAUSE WE'RE GAY, AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO -- SPEND MONEY IN A SHITTY ECONOMY, RIGHT? THE DAY THE STOCK MARKET CRASHED, I WENT OUT, AND I GOT A FACIAL... [ LAUGHTER ] ...'CAUSE THERE'S NO POINT IN BEING POOR AND UGLY, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] SO, MY HUSBAND AND I ARRIVED IN BARCELONA. OUR LUGGAGE NEVER ARRIVED. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] WE STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT, RIGHT? IN BARCELONA. I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE AIR FRANCE DESK IN BARCELONA, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. COMBINE ALL THE WARMTH OF THE FRENCH... [ LAUGHTER ] ...WITH ALL THE CUSTOMER-SERVICE SKILLS OF THE SPANISH, AND IT WILL GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE NIGHTMARE I'M LIVING. SO, MY HUSBAND AND I ARRIVE IN BARCELONA AT 3:00 A.M., AND WE HAVE NO LUGGAGE, NO TOILETRIES, NO NOTHING. SO THIS IS ME AT THE PHARMACY IN BARCELONA, TRYING TO BUY LUBE... [ LAUGHTER ] ...WITH MY &quot;DORA THE EXPLORER&quot; NINTH-GRADE SPANISH, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;UH, PERDóNEME, SEÑOR. UM, NECESITAMOS LUBRICANTE.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;UM, LUBRICANTE PARA MI CULO.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &quot;¿POR QUé? UH, PORQUE, UH... SHEEZ. PORQUE YO SOY UNO POWER BOTTOM.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;Y MI ESPOSO TIENE UN PINGA MAS GRANDE.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE GUY BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS LIKE, &quot;UH, THAT WILL BE 6 EUROS.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] I DID NOTHING BUT EMBARRASS MYSELF ALL ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN. I FARTED IN PRADA... IN ROME. AND IT WASN'T ONE OF THOSE CUTE LITTLE AIR-BISCUIT FARTS, LIKE [BLOWS LIGHTLY] OR ONE OF THOSE CUTE LITTLE QUESTION-MARK FARTS LIKE [TRUMPETS INQUISITIVELY] YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] [ Laughing ] I HAD THIS ROOMMATE WHO, EVERY MORNING AFTER HER FIRST CUP OF COFFEE, WOULD MAKE THE QUESTION-MARK FART, LIKE [TRUMPETS INQUISITIVELY] YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ONE MORNING, IT CAME OUT SCARED. IT SOUNDED LIKE [TRUMPETS NERVOUSLY] YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. IT WAS LIKE A FULL-ON ASS BERRY, YOU KNOW, LIKE PBHT! [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, &quot;OH, MY GOD!&quot; I WAS PRAYING, &quot;PLEASE LET ME BE ALL ALONE IN PRADA, RIGHT?&quot; AND I TURNED AROUND, AND I SAW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN SALESPERSON I HAD EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE LOOK AT ME JUST LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] HORRIBLE. SO THRILLED TO BE HERE TONIGHT IN THIS BEAUTIFUL THEATER. SO MUCH NICER THAN THE DUMPS I'M USUALLY BOOKED INTO. I HAD TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE AT THE WHITE PARTY IN PALM SPRINGS EARLIER THIS YEAR. ME AND 3,000 CIRCUIT QUEENS, ALL ON CRYSTAL METH. IT WAS LIKE BEING BOOKED INTO A CRACK DEN. [ LAUGHTER ] I SHOWED UP AT 3:00 A.M. THEY LOOKED LIKE THE LEMURS FROM &quot;MADAGASCAR,&quot; YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;HEY, ALEC [GROWLS] HOW ARE YOU? [ GROWLS ] SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. [ GROWLS ]&quot; GETTING HIT IN THE EYE WITH BITS OF MOLAR. YOU KNOW, IT WAS LIKE STANDING IN FRONT OF A CHIPPER. THAT STUFF IS HORRIBLE. YOU EVER NOTICE WHEN GAY GUYS DO TOO MUCH CRYSTAL, THEY ALWAYS END UP LOOKING LIKE GOLLUM FROM &quot;THE LORD OF THE RINGS&quot; TRILOGY, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [ As Gollum ] &quot;WE LOVES THE WHITE PARTY.&quot; [ Normal voice ] I CAN'T DO THAT STUFF. IT SCARES ME. I CAN'T DO COKE 'CAUSE IT MAKES ME POO IN MY PANTS. [ LAUGHTER ] I ALWAYS GET THAT FIRST-BUMP DUMP, YOU KNOW. [ SNORTS ] PBHT! YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] DIFFICULT LESSON TO LEARN AT THE WHITE PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, I KNOW I SHOULDN'T START OFF THE SHOW WITH A POOP STORY, BUT I JUST WANTED TO SET THE BAR LOW AND... [ LAUGHTER ] ...WEED OUT THE SISSIES, 'CAUSE IF YOU'VE FOUND ANYTHING I'VE SAID SO FAR OFFENSIVE, JUST RUN NOW. JUST LEAVE. OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL. WHAT AN ATTRACTIVE BUNCH. GAY MEN TEND TO BE ON THE HANDSOME SIDE 'CAUSE THEY ALL HAVE &quot;GAY FACE,&quot; RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, YOU ONLY GET CHEEKBONES LIKE THAT FROM SUCKING COCK, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] BOY, THAT ADAM LAMBERT NUMBER ON THE A.M.A.s IS LOOKING PRETTY TAME NOW, ISN'T IT? [ LAUGHTER ] NO, IT'S QUITE A WORK OUT. DID YOU EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU'RE BLOWING A GUY WITH A MUSHROOM HEAD, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING &quot;WOW.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] AND IF YOU'RE BLOWING A GUY WITH A CURVED ONE AND A MUSHROOM HEAD, YOU LOOK LIKE A BLACK GIRL SAYING &quot;WOW,&quot; YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOD. I TALK ABOUT SEX A LOT BECAUSE I JUST FEEL WE HAVE A REAL JUVENILE SENSE OF SHAME IN THE GAY COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO SEX AND SEXUALITY. PEOPLE FEEL SO ASHAMED, AND YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL ASHAMED, BECAUSE IT FEELS SO FUCKING AMAZING! GAY SEX IS, LIKE, THE PERFECT CHRISTMAS GIFT. IT'S FUN TO GIVE, IT'S FUN TO GET, AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T FIT, IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS, AM I RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] LOST MY VIRGINITY TO A GREAT BIG BLACK GUY. ONE MOMENT I WAS A PERFECT ROSEBUD. THE NEXT MINUTE, IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, RINGING A DINNER BELL, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] COTTON CANDY MACHINE AT THE COUNTY FAIR. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC AUDIENCE. ENJOY THE REST OF THE SHOW. >> ALEC MAPA. PINGA GRANDE -- MY NEW DRAG NAME. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE WORKED UNDER MANY DRAG NAMES. I WAS IN AFGHANISTAN FOR YEARS AS DELTA BURKA. [ LAUGHTER ] CONTINUING ON OUR SPIRITUAL JOURNEY, WE'RE GOING TO NOW -- FROM A FILIPINO, WE'RE GOING TO MEET A MEXICAN GIRL FROM SCOTTSBLUFF, NEBRASKA... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ...WHERE ALL THE MEXICANS COME FROM. AT LEAST, I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO TELL US NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE GOT OUT FAST. SHE LEFT NEBRASKA FAST, LIKE A SMART MEXICAN, AND WENT TO MEXICO... [ LAUGHTER ] ...WHERE SHE LEARNED ENOUGH SPANISH SO SHE COULD GET BY IN AMERICA. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE CAME BACK, AND HERE SHE IS TO SHARE HER ADVENTURE -- SANDRA VALLS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> BUT I ACTUALLY HAD A GIRLFRIEND WHO WAS LIKE, &quot;YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FUNNY. YOU SHOULD TAKE A CLASS.&quot; AND I'M LIKE, &quot;WOW, THERE'S A CLASS?&quot; SHE'S LIKE, &quot;YEAH, YOU SHOULD TAKE A CLASS. I'M GONNA SIGN YOU UP FOR IT.&quot; WE WEREN'T HAVING A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP, SO WE WERE IN COUPLE'S THERAPY. AND, OKAY, THAT'S WHAT LESBIANS DO. AND LIKE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE COMEDY CLASS, SHE BREAKS UP WITH ME. AND SHE'S LIKE, &quot;WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE COMEDY CLASS?&quot; I'M ALL, &quot;ARE YOU SERIOUS?&quot; SHE'S LIKE, &quot;I ALREADY PAID FOR IT.&quot; SO MY FIRST COMEDY SHOW WAS BITCHING ABOUT HER. AND SHE WAS IN THE AUDIENCE. AND I'M LIKE, &quot;THIS IS GREAT THERAPY. YOU'RE PAYING ME TO TELL YOU WHAT MY CRAZY HEAD SAYS.&quot; I'M WHAT'S CALLED A &quot;GOLD-STAR LESBIAN,&quot; WHICH I'VE NEVER HAD SEX WITH A GUY. NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T TRY. I'M LIKE, &quot;I'M GONNA HAVE SEX WITH A GUY JUST TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE,&quot; YOU KNOW, JUST TO SEE. AND WE'RE MAKING OUT. I'M LIKE, &quot;NOT BAD, PRETTY GOOD.&quot; AND THE GUY WAS GREAT. AND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GUY. THE MINUTE HE PULLED HIS PANTS DOWN, I GO LIKE THIS, &quot;OOH, YEAH, NO.&quot; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. I WAS LIKE, &quot;I CA-- UH, SORRY.&quot; IT JUST WASN'T ORGANIC. IT JUST WASN'T. I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE LESBIANS THAT'S, LIKE, ANTI-PENIS. I'M NOT. I WISH I HAD ONE, LIKE, FOR LIKE A DAY. HE ACTUALLY CALLED ME, AND HE'S LIKE, &quot;UH, DOES IT MAKE YOU GAY IF YOU, UH, EXPERIMENT?&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;NO. BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE ME STRAIGHT THAT I EXPERIMENTED WITH YOU.&quot; HE'S LIKE, &quot;OKAY.&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;WHY ARE YOU ASKING?&quot; &quot;OH, UH, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, ME AND A GUY ONCE...&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;OH.&quot; SECRETLY, I'M THINKING, &quot;THAT'S PRETTY GAY,&quot; BUT I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT. I GO, &quot;NO, IT DOESN'T.&quot; HE GOES, &quot;HOW ABOUT TWICE?&quot; I GO, &quot;HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING HERE?&quot; AND HE GOES, &quot;A YEAR.&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;YOU'RE A FAG. IS IT 'CAUSE OF ME? IS IT 'CAUSE OF ME?&quot; [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S UP?! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! WHAT'S UP, MY HOMOS?! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW YOU DOING, STRAIGHT FOLKS? [ LIGHT CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, EVIL &quot;HETERO-FLEXIBLES.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU MAKE US FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU. THEN YOU BREAK UP WITH US, BREAK OUR HEART, GO TO A MAN! [ LAUGHTER ] GOD-DAMN L.U.B.s! &quot;LESBIANS UNTIL THEY FIND A BOYFRIEND.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. FUCK ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. FUCK ME TWICE... 20 BUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S VERY GAY. WE LOVE FESTIVITIES. WE LOVE HOLIDAYS. I LOVE ALL HOLIDAYS, EXCEPT HALLOWEEN. 'CAUSE I'M MEXICAN, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS -- HOMEMADE. [ LAUGHTER ] MY MOTHER USED TO MAKE ALL OUR COSTUMES. SHE WOULDN'T EVEN CALL IT HALLOWEEN. SHE CALLED IT &quot;TLICK OR TLEET.&quot; WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;OH, STUPID, TLICK OR TLEET.&quot; NOT EVEN &quot;TRICK OR TREAT&quot; -- &quot;TLICK OR TLEET.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ALL, &quot;MAMI, MAMI, WHAT AM I GONNA BE FOR TLICK OR TLEET?&quot; SHE'S ALL, &quot;GO GET YOUR FATHER'S CLOTHES AND GET SOME PILLOWS. YOU'RE A FAT MAN.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;NO! I WAS A FAT MAN LAST YEAR!&quot; ONE YEAR I TRIED TO MAKE IT EASIER ON HER, AND I'M ALL LIKE, &quot;I'LL BE A GHOST.&quot; HOW DO YOU FUCK UP A GHOST? [ LAUGHTER ] 'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WHITE SHEETS -- THAT'S HOW. WE HAVE THESE YELLOW-ROSE-PRINTED SHIT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT?! AND THEN SHE WAS CUTTING ONE EYE, AND SHE MESSED UP, SO I HAD THIS ONE FUCKED-UP EYE. I WAS ALL, &quot;[ Voice breaking ] TLICK OR TLEET. TLICK OR TLEET.&quot; LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING NICE, SOMETHING NOT TOO TRAUMATIZING. LET'S TALK ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND. I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND. LET'S TALK ABOUT HER ASS. OKAY, YOU KNOW, FUCK IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND'S ASS. SHE'S THIS BEAUTIFUL, JUICY BLACK GIRL WITH AN ASS. OKAY, HER ASS IS TIGHT, BUT IT'S GOT SPREADABILITY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHTER ] SEE, I BELIEVE AN ASS SHOULD OPEN ON COMMAND, BUT NOT FALL APART, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] GAY GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE INTO ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUICY! SKINNY GIRLS, I CAN'T FUCK YOU. THAT'S LIKE FUCKING A BICYCLE. I'M SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S REALLY PAINFUL. YOU'RE DOWN THERE, DOING YOUR THING. &quot;OW, OW, OW!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] FUCKING HIPBONE IN YOUR FACE. &quot;WHAT HAPPENED?&quot; THE NEXT DAY, YOU GO TO WORK WITH RACCOON EYES. WHAT THE FUCK? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE ALL, &quot;I WAS JUMPED.&quot; YOUR TOOTH IS LOOSE. GOD DAMN! [ LAUGHTER ] MY GIRLFRIEND'S JUICY, BEAUTIFUL. SHE'S BLACK. I'M MEXICAN. WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. IN FACT, I REALIZED THAT BLACK PEOPLE LAUGH ONE OF TWO WAYS. EITHER THEY LAUGH REALLY LOUD, LIKE REALLY EXPRESSIVE, LIKE IF A BLACK PERSON'S SITTING HERE AND THINKS I'M FUNNY, THEY'D BE LIKE, &quot;WHOO WHOO,&quot; OR, &quot;OH, SNAP, NO, SHE DIDN'T. OH. OH, NO, SHE DIDN'T.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] OR THEY JUST REPEAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S HOW MY GIRLFRIEND USED TO LAUGH AT MY JOKES THE WHOLE FIRST YEAR OF OUR RELATIONSHIP. &quot;SHE SAID, 'THAT'S LIKE FUCKING A BICYCLE.'&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;MNH MNH MNH.&quot; [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M ALL, &quot;SHE SAID? IT'S ONLY ME IN THE ROOM.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;WHO YOU TALKING TO? ARE YOU ON THE PHONE? WHO'S SHE?&quot; ME. OR IF SHE REALLY THOUGHT I WAS FUNNY, SHE'D BE ALL, &quot;SHE SAID, 'THAT'S LIKE FUCKING A BICYCLE.' YOU STUPID.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, OF COURSE, MY WHITE FRIENDS -- &quot;[GASPS] SHE CALLED YOU STUPID! THAT'S ABUSIVE!&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;NO, WHITE PEOPLE.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;IT'S NOT ABUSIVE! STUPID EQUALS FUNNY! I'M THE STUPIDEST OF THEM ALL!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE YOU WANT TO TRY NEW THINGS WITH YOUR PARTNER? THEY EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS? SHE'S ALL, &quot;LET'S TRY NEW THINGS, BABY. LET'S TRY NEW THINGS. LET'S TRY A LITTLE S&amp;M.&quot; [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT AS EASY AS YOU THINK. APPARENTLY, YOU HAVE TO THINK OF A SAFE WORD OR A CODE WORD THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SEX ACT, LIKE &quot;BROCCOLI&quot; OR &quot;CURTAIN&quot; OR SOME SHIT. I DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE APPARENTLY, &quot;OW! OW! THAT HURTS! I'M BLEEDING! OW!&quot; IT'S NOT ENOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] NO. WE HAD TO GO THROUGH A SLEW OF WORDS. WE FINALLY DECIDED, &quot;KANGAROO, THEN. KANGAROO.&quot; BUT THEN SHE FLIPPED THE SCRIPT. SHE'S LIKE, &quot;KANGAROO HAS TO ALSO BE THE WORD WE USE TO GET OUT OF A SOCIAL SITUATION.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT THE HELL? WHAT AM I GONNA BE AT A PARTY, BEING ALL LIKE, &quot;HEY. [ LAUGHS ] THOSE ARE REALLY NICE BOOTS THERE. WHAT ARE THEY -- KANGAROO?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] TOTALLY TRUE STORY. MY GIRLFRIEND &quot;USED TO BE STRAIGHT.&quot; BUT SHE USED TO TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO KISS A GIRL! SO, YOU KNOW, I DECIDED THAT I WOULD BE THE ONE TO, YOU KNOW, SHOW HER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WE USED TO WORK TOGETHER, SO I'M LIKE, &quot;I'M NOT GONNA DO IT TILL THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] 'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW STRAIGHT GIRLS GET AT CHRISTMAS PARTIES. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? RIGHT? RIGHT? OPEN BAR. SO I DIDN'T EAT ALL DAY, BUT I'M AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY. I MEAN, THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME, YOU KNOW? IT'S HER FIRST LESBIAN KISS. I'M REPRESENTING ALL YOU BITCHES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE. IF I DO IT WRONG, SHE'S LIKE, &quot;I KISSED A GIRL, AND IT SUCKED.&quot; NO. LOT OF PRESSURE. I DRANK A LOT. I'M LIKE THE ROSA PARKS OF LESBIANS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I DRANK A LOT. FINALLY, I'M LIKE, &quot;LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.&quot; I'M FEELING GOOD, REALLY CONFIDENT. &quot;LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.&quot; SO I'M IN THE LINE AT 7-ELEVEN -- TRUE STORY, BY THE WAY -- WITH MY MENTOS AND SARAN WRAP. I'M GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] STRAIGHT PEOPLE, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, MAYBE THE MOP THAT SMELLED LIKE ASS OR THE WIENERS THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR, WITH THE HERPES, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE STENCH CAME AND FUCKING SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE, AND I'M ALL &quot;[GAGGING] OH, NO. NOT IN FRONT OF THE HOT CHICK. NO!&quot; I'M ALL, &quot;MAYBE I'LL ASK THE GUY FOR THE -- GO TO THE BATHROOM. EXCUSE ME, SIR? [ GAGS ] SIR?&quot; TRUE STORY. &quot;UH, ANUS, EXCUSE ME.&quot; THAT WAS HIS NAME. AND HE GOES, &quot;MY NAME IS 'ANOOSE.'&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. IN AMERICA, A-N-U-S IS ANUS. [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;EXCUSE ME. CAN I PLEASE USE YOUR BATHROOM?&quot; &quot;NO, GO ACROSS THE STREET.&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;SHIT.&quot; &quot;MAYBE THE GUY OVER THERE BY THE COFFEE.&quot; TRUE STORY. &quot;EXCUSE ME, SHIT-HEAD.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;MY NAME IS 'SHA TEED.'&quot; WHAT THE FUCK?! [ LAUGHTER ] NO! THEN DON'T PUT A HYPHEN BETWEEN THE &quot;T&quot; AND THE &quot;H.&quot; PUT IT TOGETHER. &quot;CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM?&quot; &quot;NO, GO ACROSS THE STREET.&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;FUCK YOU, ANUS AND SHIT-HEAD! ROT IN HELL!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] I GO ACROSS SUNSET BOULEVARD, DODGING CARS. [ IMITATING CARS ] I FINALLY GET TO A GAS STATION. &quot;EXCUSE ME, JUAN.&quot; HE'S ALL, &quot;MY NAME IS 'JEW ON.'&quot; I'm just kidding. [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;CAN I PLEASE USE THE BATHROOM?&quot; &quot;SURE, GO AHEAD.&quot; HE GIVES ME THIS KEY ATTACHED TO, LIKE, A MUFFLER... [ LAUGHTER ] ...OR SOMETHING. I GO TO THE DOOR, AND I OPEN IT. TRUE STORY. I LOOK IN THERE -- EYE LEVEL -- THERE IS FRESH SHIT ON THE WALL. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] I'M ALL, &quot;OH, MY GOD! HOW DID IT GET UP THERE? OHHHH!&quot; IT'S A FUCKED-UP JACKSON POLLOCK OF CRAP AND CURRY. [ LAUGHTER ] I BRING THE KEY BACK. AND REAL SNOBBY, I SAY, &quot;WHY DO YOU KEEP IT LOCKED? YOU AFRAID SOMEONE WILL CLEAN IT?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] AND I WALK BACK. I WALK BACK TO THE CAR, AND I HICCUP, AND I THROW UP AGAIN! [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] BUT MY GIRLFRIEND NEVER MENTIONED IF FOR FOUR YEARS. THAT'S TRUE LOVE. NOW, HERE'S WHAT I'M SAYING -- &quot;WHEN YOU FIND LOVE, YOU HANG ON TO IT.&quot; YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO WORK ON THIS GAY-MARRIAGE THING, BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT 'CAUSE WE'RE ALL CONNECTED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT ONE HUMAN REVOLUTION IN JUST ONE PERSON CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. YOU CHANGE YOURSELF, YOU CHANGE THE WORLD. MANY IN BODY, ONE IN MIND. LET'S GO CHANGE THE WORLD, PEOPLE. THANK YOU. I'M SANDRA VALLS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> SANDRA VALLS! AY, PAPI! NOW I KNOW WHENEVER -- LAST YEAR, WHEN I WAS WRITING THE OSCARS SHOW, WHENEVER I'D GO INTO HUGH JACKMAN'S ROOM, HE'D SAY, &quot;KANGAROO!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S HIS SAFE WORD. HERE'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT WRITING THE ACADEMY AWARDS. YOU GET TO SAY THE FOLLOWING THING, &quot;SOPHIA LOREN, MEET JACK BLACK.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] SHE HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS. WELL, WHY SHOULD SHE? YOU THINK SHE'S SITTING AT HOME, WATCHING &quot;NACHO LIBRE&quot;? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SHE WAS GRACIOUS. SHE WAS INCREDIBLY GRACIOUS. SHE'S SOPHIA LOREN, YOU KNOW? SHE'S GREAT. SHE STOOD THERE WITH ONE HAND ON HER HIP -- WHICH SHE HAS TO DO, OR SHE'LL PITCH FORWARD. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND. [ LAUGHTER ] REQUIRES CONSTANT BUTTRESSING. THAT'S WHAT THE HUSBAND DID, I THINK. HE WAS SHORT, WOULD RUN IN FRONT OF HER GOING, &quot;SOPHIA, FALL FORWARD.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, YOU KNOW, BUT SHE WAS AS SWEET AS COULD BE. SHE BEGAN SPEAKING TO HIM IN MENU ITALIAN, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THICK ITALIAN -- LIKE, &quot;PUTTANESCA, ALFRESCO, PARMESAN.&quot; AND SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT SHE WAS SAYING, AND NEITHER DID HE, AND IT WAS FINE. AND THEN SHIRLEY MacLAINE CAME OVER AND TOOK HER AROUND AND INTRODUCED HER TO PEOPLE SHIRLEY KNEW FROM A PREVIOUS LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE HAD A WONDERFUL SHOW. NOW, ON THIS JOURNEY THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO GO, WE'RE GOING SOMEPLACE EVEN STRANGER, IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS. THIS GUY HAS MY UNDYING ADMIRATION. THIS GUY IS AN OUT COMIC WHO IS ABOUT TO GO ON HIS 35th TOUR OF IRAQ, AS A STAND-UP FOR OUR TROOPS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEP. THIS IS WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. SCOTT KENNEDY. >> AND ALL MY BUDDIES ALWAYS ASK ME, TOO. THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;WAS IT EASIER FOR YOU? I MEAN, YOU PLAYED FOOTBALL WITH US. NOBODY KNOWS YOU'RE GAY TILL YOU TELL THEM. WHY DO YOU TELL THEM?&quot; I MEAN, I DON'T SKIP AND SING SHOW TUNES. I'M FROM TEXAS. PEOPLE THINK I'M A REDNECK, BUT I'M A PINK NECK. SO IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING, I MEAN, 'CAUSE I'M STILL A GUY. I THINK NINTH GRADE OR WHATEVER, I WAS JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWERS, 'CAUSE I ENJOY THAT, AND THE COACH CAME IN. I PLAYED FOOTBALL. THE COACH WAS LIKE, &quot;WHAT THE FUCK?&quot; I GO, &quot;IT'S MY PENIS. I'LL WASH IT AS FAST AS I WANT.&quot; THAT'S NOT A GAY THING, BY THE WAY. OH, MY GOD, SERIOUSLY. GUYS, IF YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU -- IT'S NOT GAY. IT'S JUST WE THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS. I GO ONCE A MONTH TO IRAQ, EVERY MONTH FOR 12 DAYS. I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU, I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S GAYS IN THE MILITARY, THERE ARE. IF YOU'RE SAYING I CAN'T FIGHT FOR MY COUNTRY OR I'M NOT PATRIOTIC, MAN, I'VE BEEN THERE 35 TIMES. I GOT SHOT RIGHT HERE. I'VE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN NINE TIMES. IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX, MAN. WHEN YOU'RE GETTING SHOT AT... THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN SERVE MY COUNTRY, AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THOSE, BUT, YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? AND I HAVE ACTUALLY HAD THIS BIGGEST MARINE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. HE WOULD SCARE YOU TO DEATH. AND AT THE END OF MY SHOW, HE CAME UP TO ME. HE HUGGED ME AND WHISPERED IN MY EAR, &quot;I'M FAMILY,&quot; WHICH MEANS HE'S GAY. SO IF YOU'RE PATRIOTIC AND YOU WANT TO FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY, I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR BEDROOM. I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR BEDROOM. IT MIGHT BE NASTY WITH A GIRL AND A BOY AND A... ANYWAY -- I MEAN, I STILL LOVE YOU, BUT I JUST -- I DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT. DON'T PREACH ABOUT IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU, GUYS, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AH, THANK YOU, GUYS. WOW! WHAT A NICE CROWD! YOU GUYS ARE VERY POLITE. YOU APPLAUD WHEN WE COME ON STAGE, AND THAT MAKES US FEEL GOOD, LIKE WE HAVE A GOOD JOB. AND THIS IS A GOOD JOB, TOO. DON'T GET ME WRONG. I JUST -- I DON'T THINK IT'S, LIKE, THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD OR ANYTHING. I'VE GIVEN THAT SOME THOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] BEST JOB IN THE WORLD? I THINK IF YOU WORKED AT, LIKE, A GIFT SHOP AT AN AIRPORT. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU COULD BE AS RUDE AS YOU WANT TO BE, 'CAUSE PEOPLE GOT TO GO. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] YOU COULD BE HONEST EVERY DAY, BE LIKE, &quot;YEAH, SNICKERS ARE THREE FOR A DOLLAR, BUT YOUR FAT ASS DOESN'T NEED THREE.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;OH, DO I HAVE A MANAGER? YEAH, HE'LL BE BACK IN LIKE AN HOUR, SO...&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;TICKTOCK, MOTHERFUCKER, TICKTOCK.&quot; OH, IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE FOR SHOWTIME. I WAS ACTUALLY IN LAS VEGAS THIS WEEK, SO I FLEW IN JUST FOR THE SHOW, AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A CAB DRIVER. AND I ONLY BRING THIS UP 'CAUSE IT HAS GONE THROUGH MY MIND ALL DAY LONG. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY, AND THE WHOLE DAY, YOU THINK, &quot;WAS I THE ASSHOLE, OR WAS HE THE ASSHOLE?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? AND I KEEP REPLAYING THE CONVERSATION IN MY HEAD. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS IN LAS VEGAS. CABDRIVER OBVIOUSLY CAME TO THE HOTEL. HE GOES, &quot;WHERE DO YOU NEED TO GO TO, MR. KENNEDY?&quot; &quot;I NEED TO GO TO L.A. I'M GOING TO THE AIRPORT.&quot; HE GOES, &quot;OH, VERY NICE.&quot; HE GOES, &quot;YOU'RE FLYING TO L.A.?&quot; I GO, &quot;YEAH.&quot; HE PICKED UP MY SUITCASE, AND THEN HE SAID, &quot;MM, BIG BAG, SHORT TRIP.&quot; [ CHUCKLES ] [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, &quot;MAYBE ME STAY LONG TIME.&quot; WHAT THE FUCK? WHY ARE WE TALKING NATIVE AMERICAN ALL OF A SUDDEN? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK IT WAS ME AND NOT HIM, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, 'CAUSE MY CONVERSATION SKILLS, LIKE, THEY KEPT ALL DAY LONG TODAY. A FRIEND OF MINE PICKED ME UP AT THE AIRPORT, AND WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE WE WERE IN DIAPERS. HE LIVES OUT HERE WITH HIS FAMILY. HE WAS DRIVING ME BACK TO MY HOUSE, AND HE GOES, &quot;HEY, SCOTT, DO YOU MIND IF WE STOP ON THE WAY?&quot; I GO, &quot;NO, NOT AT ALL.&quot; WE ENDED UP AT THE MALL, AND WE'RE WALKING THROUGH THE MALL. I GO, &quot;HEY, WHAT ARE WE BUYING AT THE MALL?&quot; HE GOES, &quot;OH, I NEED TO PICK UP SHAUN SOME THINGS.&quot; SHAUN'S HIS LITTLE BOY, WHO WASN'T WITH US. AND I GO, &quot;COOL. WHAT ARE WE BUYING SHAUNDY TODAY?&quot; AND HE GOES, &quot;OH, I NEED TO PICK HIM UP SOME TOPS.&quot; AND I GO, &quot;OKAY. UM, DO YOU MEAN SHIRTS?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE GOES, &quot;YEAH, I CALL MY SON'S SHIRTS TOPS.&quot; [ Laughing ] AND I GO, &quot;WELL, IF YOU CONTINUE TO CALL YOUR SON'S SHIRTS TOPS, HE'S GONNA END UP A BOTTOM.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I THINK I'M RIGHT, BUT, UH... SO, WE GOT A BIG, DIVERSE CROWD. WHERE ARE THE STRAIGHT PEOPLE? BY APPLAUSE, STRAIGHT FOLKS? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T BE -- YEAH? DON'T BE SHY. IT'S OKAY. I MEAN, WE KNOW YOU WERE BORN THAT WAY. IT'S OKAY. I MEAN, FUCK. IF YOU HAVE A PARADE, I'LL MARCH. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK. RIGHT? I MEAN, I DON'T WANT YOU TEACHING KIDS. I'LL BE HONEST. BUT OTHER THAN THAT... [ LAUGHTER ] ...I DON'T CARE... WHAT YOU DO. OH, MY GOD. OVER HERE, SIR. YOU APPLAUDED. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? NO, RIGHT THERE IN THE BLACK. DIDN'T YOU? STRAIGHT GUY? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> ANDREW. >> ANDREW. I'M SCOTT. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHERE YOU FROM, ANDREW? >> BOSTON. >> BOSTON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL BE FLYING THERE TOMORROW, ACTUALLY. AND BIG BAG, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOD. SO, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO LAS VEGAS BEFORE? >> YEAH. >> YEAH, IT'S FUN, ISN'T IT? SO, YOU'RE STRAIGHT? >> YEAH. >> NEVER BEEN WITH A GUY? >> NO. >> NO. ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SEE DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE. LIKE ME, I'M A GOOD COOK. AND WHEN I TELL PEOPLE I'M A GOOD COOK, THEY FREAK OUT. THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;REALLY?!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] I SWEAR TO GOD. I'M LIKE, &quot;I CAN COOK.&quot; &quot;REALLY?!&quot; WHY WOULD YOU BE THAT SURPRISED THAT I CAN COOK? I'M A BIG BOY. I CAN COOK, YOU KNOW? THAT GOES HAND IN HAND. I MEAN, I LIKE TO DRINK. I LIKE TO GAMBLE. I HAVE A VERY ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY. IN FACT, I JUST BOUGHT A BOOK ON ADDICTION. I FUCKING LOVE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ Laughing ] I DO. I'M GONNA BUY ANOTHER COPY, I THINK. I HOPE THE GUY ANSWERS HIS PAGE. SO, ANDREW, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN WITH A GUY? >> NO. >> EVER? >> NO. >> REALLY?! EVER? [ LAUGHTER ] NOTHING? LIKE, SERIOUSLY, LIKE A SEVENTH-GRADE SLEEPOVER, A TENT IN THE BACK, YOU KNOW, SWORD FIGHT, NOTHING? [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK AT ALL THE STRAIGHT GUYS GOING, &quot;A SWORD FIGHT COUNTS?&quot; NO, IT DOESN'T. [ LAUGHTER ] IT DOESN'T COUNT. DID YOU PLAY SPORTS GROWING UP, ANDREW? >> I DID. >> WHAT DID YOU PLAY? >> I RAN TRACK. >> [ Laughing ] TRACK? AND YOU NEVER SUCKED A DICK? [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SORRY. DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD? I MEAN, 'CAUSE I PLAYED FOOTBALL, AND I'M THE GAY GUY, BUT YOU WERE IN TRACK AND FIELD AND NEVER FUCKED -- ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ SIGHS ] WELL, YOU'RE ADORABLE. I'M ATTRACTED TO GUYS LIKE YOU. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD THROW A FOOTBALL AND A TANTRUM, AND THAT IS EXACTLY... [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] EXACTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. OH. BUT, ACTUALLY, I'M NOT LOOKING ANYMORE. I ACTUALLY HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEP. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE THAT. YOU'RE APPLAUDING. &quot;OH, THE BIG FAT GUY GOT SOMETHING. THAT'S NICE.&quot; 'CAUSE, SERIOUSLY, IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME. WHEN I WAS DATING -- I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK LIKE ME AND YOU'RE GAY AND GO TO A GAY BAR, GUYS DON'T THINK YOU'RE THERE TO BLOW THEM. THEY THINK YOU'RE THERE TO BASH THEM. [ Laughing ] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I MEAN, I'LL WALK IN, DRESSED LIKE THIS. I'M LIKE, &quot;HEY, WHAT'S UP?&quot; THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;I DON'T THINK SO.&quot; [ IMITATES WHISTLE ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ IMITATES WHISTLE ] THEY'RE BLOWING THE RAPE WHISTLE. [ IMITATES WHISTLE ] CUT TO FOUR LESBIANS KICKING THE SHIT OUT OF ME. NO, LESBIANS -- WHERE ARE THE LESBIANS AT, BY APPLAUSE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE YOU GO. I LOVE MY LESBIAN SISTERS. AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS -- IF YOU'RE STRAIGHT AND YOU DON'T KNOW THIS, LESBIANS ARE VERY, VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE. I SWEAR TO GOD. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE SCENARIOS THAT I'VE SEEN. LIKE, TWO GAY GUYS WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND A COUPLE STRAIGHT GUYS ARE WALKING TOWARD THEM, STRAIGHT GUYS LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND GO, &quot;PBHT. FAGS.&quot; RIGHT? TWO LESBIANS WALKING NEAR THOSE STRAIGHT PEOPLE, STRAIGHT GUYS GO, &quot;LET'S CROSS THE STREET.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;I DON'T WANT ANY PROBLEMS.&quot; LESBIANS ARE THE BEST. I LIVED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, FOR A LONG TIME, AND THEY DIDN'T JUST HAVE ONE LESBIAN BAR THERE. THEY HAD A WHOLE -- IT WAS AN OLD, LIKE, SHOPPING CENTER, AND THEY CONVERTED IT ALL INTO A LESBIAN COMPLEX. AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD GET IN HIGH SCHOOL, BUT IT'S NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, IT WAS LIKE SEVEN DIFFERENT BARS UNDER ONE ROOF, AND THEY HAD EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE. IT WASN'T JUST LESBIANS. IT WAS STRAIGHT PEOPLE COULD GO THERE, GAY PEOPLE -- WHATEVER. IT WAS FUN. BUT I CAN SAY THIS -- I'VE HAD THE MOST FUN IN MY LIFE IN A LESBIAN BAR, AND I'VE BEEN SCAREDER THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE IN A LESBIAN BAR. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, I SWEAR TO GOD -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT TRUE FEAR IS UNTIL YOU WALK INTO A LESBIAN BAR AT LIKE 1:30 A.M. AND SEE THREE DRUNK WOMEN LOOKING AT YOU AT THE BAR, GOING, &quot;WHO'S THE CUTE CHICK IN THE JERSEY?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;WHAT?&quot; I MEAN, I DRANK THAT FREE BEER. I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU. BUT I, UM... [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T SHOOT POOL, SO THEY FUCKING KNEW, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] OH. [ SIGHS ] ANDREW. ARE YOU OKAY? YOU'RE JUST ROCKING BACK AND FORTH, GOING... ♪ JESUS LOVES ME ♪ ♪ YES, I KNOW ♪ ♪ FOR THE BIBLE ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] DID IT SCARE YOU WHEN I TOLD YOU I FOUND YOU ATTRACTIVE? >> NO. >> [ Laughing ] &quot;NO&quot;?! OKAY, IT -- LET ME -- IT SHOULD, ALL RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] I'M BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD YOU DOWN AND DO WHATEVER I WANT. YOU SHOULD BE SCARED TO FUCKING DEATH. SERIOUSLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, ANDREW, YOU COULD WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, WEARING THIS JERSEY AND NOTHING ELSE. [ Laughing ] DO YOU REALIZE? YOU'LL BE AT WORK, GOING, &quot;OH, MY GOD, THAT COMEDY SHOW FOR SHOWTIME MADE MY BUTT HURT.&quot; HEY, GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS THE TROOPS. I'M SCOTT KENNEDY. THANK YOU, GUYS, VERY MUCH. >> SCOTT KENNEDY. ONLY MAN I EVER KNEW WHO WROTE HIS NAME ON THE WALL OF A MOSQUE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND PHONE NUMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS THINKING ABOUT -- I HAVEN'T, YOU KNOW, BEEN TO IRAQ, BUT I HAVE DRIVEN A HUMMER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS KEY TO THE IRAQ EXPERIENCE. IT WAS A FRIEND'S HUMMER, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I -- FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T GET INTO A HUMMER. I MEAN, HAVE YOU TRIED? IT'S LIKE, YOU HAVE TO GO BUY THEM BY SIZE. &quot;I'D LIKE A HUMMER AT 46&quot; LONG.&quot; SO YOU GET INTO THE THING, AND YOU'RE HUNCHED OVER LIKE THIS. AND IT HAD ONE OF THOSE RADIOS THAT IS VOICE ACTIVATED, AND YOU TELL IT WHAT YOU WANT, AND IT'S BEEN PROGRAMMED. SO I SAID, &quot;COUNTRY MUSIC,&quot; AND GARTH BROOKS CAME ON. AND I SAID, &quot;MOTOWN,&quot; AND THE SUPREMES CAME ON. AND THEN A WOMAN ON LANKERSHIM CUT ME OFF, AND I SAID, &quot;YOU MISERABLE BITCH,&quot; AND DR. LAURA CAME ON. [ LAUGHTER ] I ONLY MENTION HER BECAUSE WE GOT HER OFF THE AIR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHE'S IN RADIO, BUT WE GOT HER OFF TV. SO WE HAVE POWER. AND SPEAKING OF POWER, I AM NOW GOING TO BRING THE ONLY OTHER GORGEOUS BLONDE ON THE SHOW, ASIDE FROM MYSELF, OUT HERE. WHEN YOU SEE HER, YOUR FIRST REACTION -- IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE, YOU WILL THINK, &quot;OH, MY GOD, ELLEN DeGENERES HAS AN EVIL TWIN.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] AND IF YOU HAVE SEEN HER BEFORE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR -- THE INCREDIBLE POPPY CHAMPLIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> MY NAME, POPPY, CAME FROM MY AUNT POPPY, WHO -- HER REAL NAME WAS PATRICIA. BUT FOR THE COMEDY SHOW, I JUST SAY THAT MY PARENTS WERE HEROIN ADDICTS. MAKES IT WORK. [ Laughing ] YOU KNOW, AND THEN I SAY MY BROTHER'S NAME'S OPIE. SO I CAME FROM A BIG DRUGGIE FAMILY. BUT I DIDN'T REALLY. WE SMOKED POT, BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT. AND I QUIT POT NOW, WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT, TO QUIT SMOKING POT, PEOPLE. BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO QUIT WHEN YOU STILL SELL IT, LIKE I DO. SO, ANYWAY, FOR A WOMAN TO BE FUNNY, I THINK, IS A VERY POWERFUL PLACE TO BE, AND NOT A LOT OF WOMEN GET TO DO IT. JOAN RIVERS ACTUALLY WAS ALMOST A MENTOR FOR ME. IT WAS KIND OF BIZARRE, BUT I STARTED DOING TOO MUCH COCAINE, AND MY VOICE [as Rivers] STARTED CHANGING, AND I STARTED SOUNDING... &quot;CAN WE TALK?&quot; I JUST STARTED SOUNDING LIKE JOAN RIVERS. AY AY AY AY AY AY AY! [ LAUGHS ] [ Normal voice ] AND THEN I JUST STARTED DOING HER ACT, WHICH I DIDN'T REALIZE I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO. AND I ACTUALLY DID IT IN A HOTEL AND GOT PAID, AND SO I LEARNED HOW TO BE JOAN RIVERS. YOU KNOW, I LEARNED HOW TO BE A COMEDIAN. 2000 -- I THINK I CAME OUT IN 2000, BECAUSE I JUST FELT LIKE I WASN'T TELLING ALL THE TRUTH. AND, I THINK, TO BE REALLY GOOD AND REALLY FUNNY AND -- I GUESS YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST, YOU KNOW? YOU CAN'T REALLY HIDE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH! HOW YOU GUYS DOING? WHOO! WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT TO SHOWTIME! [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S AWESOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT TO THE SHOW, YOU BIG GAY PEOPLE! THANK YOU. SO, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COUPLES? THAT'S A BIG DEAL, ISN'T IT? COUPLES? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW ABOUT SINGLES? SINGLE PEOPLE? SINGLES? [ LOUD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. THAT'S A LOT HAPPIER. YOU NOTICE THAT? A LOT HAPPIER. HOW MANY COUPLES ARE LOOKING FOR A SINGLE? ANYBODY LIKE THAT? >> YES! >> [ Laughing ] YEAH! THAT IS HAPPENING A LOT, ISN'T IT? I ASKED MY LAST GIRLFRIEND IF WE COULD DO THAT, YOU KNOW, IF I COULD BRING ANOTHER WOMAN INTO THE RELATIONSHIP. AND SHE'S LIKE, &quot;OKAY.&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;REALLY?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;I WAS ONLY KIDDING.&quot; SHE'S LIKE, &quot;NO, OKAY, AS LONG AS I CAN CHOOSE HER.&quot; I'M LIKE, &quot;ALL RIGHT, CHOOSE HER. WHAT DO YOU GOT?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE STARTED SEEING THIS WOMAN ONCE A WEEK, COST US 140 BUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, COUPLES COUNSELING. THAT'S WHERE WE WENT -- COUPLES COUNSELING. OH, LESBIANS LOVE GOING TO COUPLES COUNSELING, DON'T WE? LOVE IT. LOVE IT. LOVE IT. LOVE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE HAD TOO MANY PARTNERS IN MY GAY PROFESSIONAL CAREER. [ LAUGHTER ] I COULD START A LAW FIRM AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I COULD. AND MY LAST ONE WAS LIKE 23 YEARS OLD. THAT WAS RIDICULOUS. WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR, A JUNIOR PARTNER? MAYBE. MAYBE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M TELLING YOU, MAN. AND I DON'T KNOW. I FIGHT A LITTLE TOO MUCH WHEN I GET IN RELATIONSHIPS. ANYBODY FIGHT A LITTLE BIT? HAVE LITTLE ARGUMENTS? YOU KNOW, I SWEAR -- I NEEDED, LIKE, THE DYKE WHISPERER TO COME IN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS WRONG WITH US? THE THERAPIST SAID, &quot;YOU HAVE A FEAR OF COMMITMENT, POPPY. YOU HAVE A FEAR OF COMMITMENT. AS SOON AS YOU LET SOMEBODY IN, YOU GET THEM A LITTLE TOO CLOSE, THEY GET A LITTLE TOO INTIMATE, YOU GET A LITTLE PERSONAL, YOU PUSH HER AWAY.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, &quot;YEAH? WELL, I'M GETTING RID OF YOU NEXT WEEK.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S DIFFICULT. I MEAN, MAYBE I HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH RELATIONSHIPS, I ADMIT. I HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE I TRAVEL A LOT AND I'M AN ASSHOLE. BUT ANYWAY... [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] NO, I TRAVEL. I TRAVEL A LOT, AND EVEN MY DOG IS STARTING TO GET PISSED OFF AT ME. ARE YOU DOG PEOPLE? ARE YOU GUYS DOG PEOPLE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES! YES! WHOO! [ LAUGHS ] SO, I WANT TO BRING MY DOG WITH ME, RIGHT? SO -- BUT HE'S JUST A LITTLE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE CARRIER THAT GOES UNDER THE SEAT ON THE AIRLINE, RIGHT? SO, ANYWAY, I GOT HIM SOME REALLY GOOD DRUGS, AND HE FITS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, &quot;AHA!&quot; [ LAUGHS ] [ GROWLS ] &quot;GET IN THERE! GET IN THERE!&quot; DRAG. DRAG. SO I'M DRAGGING HIM UP TO THE COUNTER, AND THE LADY'S LIKE, &quot;OH, NO. OH, NO.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] I'M LIKE &quot;[Laughing] WHAT? HE'S IN THERE. LOOK. HE FITS.&quot; [ LAUGHS ] RIGHT? HIS FACE IS ALL &quot;BLAAH!&quot; YOU KNOW. I'M LIKE, &quot;HE'S SLEEPING. THAT'S HOW COMFORTABLE HE IS.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;NO. NO. NO.&quot; [ LAUGHS ] &quot;WE INSIST THAT THE DOG BE ABLE TO STAND COMPLETELY UP AND TURN COMPLETELY AROUND IN THE CARRIER, OR ELSE WE CONSIDER THAT TORTURE.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I CAN'T STAND COMPLETELY UP AND TURN COMPLETELY AROUND IN MY SEAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHY ISN'T THAT TORTURE?! THAT'S TORTURE, TOO! [ LAUGHS ] NO, THAT'S TORTURE. ANYWAY, SO I COULDN'T BRING HIM ON THE PLANE, SO THEN I THOUGHT, &quot;WELL, THEN I'LL TRY TO GET HIM ON A TRAIN. I'LL GET HIM ON THE TRAIN TO COME WITH ME.&quot; SO, BUT THE TRAINS -- HAVE YOU TRIED THIS? THE TRAINS INSIST THAT THE DOG BE A SERVICE ANIMAL. WELL, I'M A LITTLE DESPERATE 'CAUSE I WANT TO BRING HIM, SO I WENT AND I GOT THE ORANGE VEST. ANYBODY? [ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] YOU PUT THE ORANGE VEST ON AND THE LITTLE LEATHER HARNESS WITH THE HANDLE AND EVERYTHING, THE BLACK GLASSES, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHS ] BUT HE'S A SHIH TZU, SO I HAVE TO WALK LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHING ] THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;NO. NO. NO.&quot; I LOVE THEM, THOUGH. I LOVE THE EXCURSIONS. I GO ON ALL THE LESBIAN -- LESBIANS LOVE THE EXCURSIONS ON THE CRUISES, DON'T WE? >> YEAH! >> WE TURN INTO DORA THE EXPLORER. WE ARE OUT THERE WITH OUR FANNY PACK, A MACHETE, A JUNGLE BIKE. &quot;LET'S GO, LADIES!&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] &quot;WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING!&quot; AND THESE WOMEN ARE VERY EAGER BEAVERS. I GOT TO TELL YOU -- VERY EAGER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] DOUBLE ENTENDRE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] THEY ARE EAGER BEAVERS! BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;POPPY, LET'S GO SEE THE RUINS OF TULUM. I'M LIKE, &quot;ALL RIGHT. I'M DOWN WITH THE RUINS OF TULUM. WHAT TIME WE GOING?&quot; THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;7:00.&quot; &quot;WHAT?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] &quot;7:00 A.M.? 7:00 A.M.? THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE RUINS OF TULUM?&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, &quot;IF I WANT TO SEE RUINS AT 7:00 A.M., I'LL LOOK IN THE MIRROR.&quot; I DON'T NEED TO GO TO THE RUINS OF TULUM. [ LAUGHS ] THE MEN, NOT SO MUCH WITH THE EXCURSIONS, RIGHT, THE GAY MEN? NO. ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS ARE PRETTY MUCH HAPPENING ON THE CRUISE SHIP. [ LAUGHS ] RIGHT? YEAH. &quot;HAVE A DRINK, A DANCE, AND NOW LET'S GO FIND THAT REMOTE BATHROOM I FOUND AT THE OTHER END OF THE SHIP.&quot; GUYS, YOU GET TO GET BLOWJOBS SO FAST AND HAVE NO STRINGS ATTACHED AT ALL. THAT IS AMAZING TO ME! [ LAUGHTER ] THE GUY'S ON HIS KNEES STILL. &quot;YOU WANT MY NUMBER?&quot; &quot;NOPE, I'M GOOD.&quot; &quot;OKAY, BYE-BYE. SEE YOU LATER.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] OH, MY GOD! LESBIANS, CAN WE DO THAT? >> NO. >> UH, NO. HELLO? [ LAUGHTER ] AS SOON AS WE HAVE SEX, LET THE CODEPENDENCY BEGIN. THAT IS IT. RIGHT? OH. AND THEN WE NEVER BREAK UP. WE NEVER BREAK UP. SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER 55 YEARS AGO. WE'RE STILL TOGETHER. LESBIANS ARE LIKE STAMPS -- ONCE YOU LICK THEM, THEY STICK. THAT IS IT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU LEARN. YOU LEARN. [ LAUGHS ] YOU LEARN ON THE CRUISES, THOUGH. YOU LEARN. I NEVER GO IN THE MEN'S SAUNA ON THE CRUISES. DO NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S DANGEROUS.

AND NOW THERE'S VIAGRA FOR WOMEN. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS? YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE GONNA BE WITH THAT. I THINK YOUR LIPS ARE GONNA BLOW UP LIKE PONTOONS -- THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. [ LAUGHTER ] HOLY SHIT! &quot;THAT'S NOT A CAMEL TOE -- THAT'S A CATCHER'S MITT. THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?&quot; WHOO! THAT'S A -- WOW! TALK ABOUT A &quot;VAGINA MONOLOGUE.&quot; HELLO! HELLO! [ Laughing ] HELLO! THANKS A LOT, YOU GUYS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOD BLESS YOU! >> LET'S BRING THEM ALL OUT. ALEC MAPA! SANDRA! SCOTT KENNEDY! AND POPPY CHAMPLIN! HEY! THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'LL BE GAY ALL WEEK. SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER KIND OF MARRIAGE. PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DEFEND THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE ARE CRAZY BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE. WE WANT TO HAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT MARRIED PEOPLE HAVE. WE WANT TO HAVE THE 1,500 RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MARRIED DON'T GET. AND THE ONLY ARGUMENT REALLY AGAINST IT IS RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY, AND IT'S A TOUGH ONE. RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY TRUMPS A LOT, YOU KNOW? IT HAS OVER THE CENTURIES. >> I'M GOING TO GO SLAP SCOTT MONTOYA IN THE BUTT. [ LAUGHS ] >> THAT WAS A TAG TEAM. >> WE'VE BEEN ON THE BUS TOGETHER. >> WE'VE GOT STORIES, RIGHT HERE. >> WE HAVE STORIES! >> DIDN'T WE HAVE TO SIGN A CONFIDENTIALITY WAIVER ON THAT TOUR? >> I THINK WE DID. >> I THINK WE DID.
