The princess will be coming on board. Thank you. Solve the Mystery After Dinner (subtitles by tronella) Kageyama... I feel sick... We missed the departure time from Yokohama, so we had to take a helicopter even though you hate them. I was working right up to the last minute. Ah, I want to get changed soon... Good grief... Following the boat we missed in a helicopter is something only people like you can do my lady. A world-leading company, the Hosho group. The only child of its head, Hosho Seitaro is me, Hosho Reiko. In other words, I am a true young lady and a detective. While hiding my status as a young lady from my dull work colleagues I face terrible crimes every day. Excuse me, but are you blind, my lady? My butler is this mysterious man, Kageyama. Although he's usually polite and kind, when we talk about cases he speaks to me with a shamelessly sharp tongue. However, his amazing deductive powers let him solve cases in the blink of an eye so he's not a man to make light of. My apologies for the delay. I am Captain Kaibara. I was surprised that you managed to catch us up by helicopter! Thank you for welcoming us on board. It must be 18 years since I was on this ship. Since the master left for Singapore on navy business. This was originally a passenger ship, wasn't it? The Superstar Virgo, aka the Princess Reiko. This is its last voyage. It's embarrassing, so stop calling it by that name. Reiko-san! Reiko-sama. It can't be, Todo-san? Yes, I'm so glad you made it. Kageyama, this is the cabin manager, Todo-san. He invites me here every year. I am the butler, Kageyama. I've heard so much about you. Having my lady here on our last voyage... My dream of meeting you again came true. Well, let me show you around. This way. Sorry I'm late. You're slow! Were you flirting with Rinko-chan again? Balaji-chan, smile properly! You're part of the final crew, after all. Yes! Smile! Um... Mitsuki-san. I told you to smile. When this cruise is over, will you... ...duel with me? Duel? Will you marry me? Really? You can't? I'll think about it... Within the ship there are restaurants and shops and all kinds of other amusement facilities. Between passengers and crew, there are 3000 people. You can pay for everything with these cards, so you don't need any cash during the cruise. So you can forget all about it. It's like a small town, isn't it? Drinking cocktails by the pool, getting my nails done or shopping, having dinner while watching an evening show, and meeting a man like Leo-sama from that film... I could end up doing something like that. My lady, are you alright? Huh? Your usually calm face is getting over the top and you look extremely carefree, but... I'll turn a blind eye to your mildly insulting words. No matter what, I'm in a really good mood right now. By the way, Kageyama... you haven't missed anything out of the schedule, have you? After tonight's welcome party you'll have a full-body treatment in the Gregoria Spa. I'll look forward to it. Then there must be some lovely prince on board... Yes yes yes yes.. This really is a room worthy of me. It can't be... Detective Kazamatsuri? What? Isn't that Hosho-kun? My boss, Detective Kazamatsuri. Heir to the car manufacturing company Kazamatsuri Motors, and a detective in Kunitachi police department. His absurd theories are always derailing investigations and luring me into maze-like cases. Without knowing that I, his junior, am a company heir when he sees me in my young lady form Oh! Shourei-san. he continues to mistake me for a young woman from Hong Kong, Hou Shourei. You're travelling to Hong Kong on this ship as well? Oh! Could it be that you're following me? I'm just on holiday. Detective, why are you on this ship? That's because I was chosen to protect the K-Lion. K-Lion? The Kunitachi Lion, commonly known as K-Lion, is a famous artwork by an artist from Kunitachi, which is being sent to Singapore as a symbol of friendship. But why you, detective? Shh! The truth is, we've been informed that an internationally famous thief is on board this boat. We received the news from Interpol, you know? And I was chosen to escort it. I mean, I was handpicked. Certainly, thanks to Kageyama, your cases are always resolved quickly, but... Anyway, I am staying in this room. It even has a security system that I thought up myself. Look, Hosho-kun! An electric lock that requires a 4-digit code. The moment someone touches it, alarms go off throughout the ship. Infrared sensors! No one can even lay a hand on it. It's perfect. It's tough being a detective, working on such a lovely ship. You just want to play around, right? Oh, Hosho-kun, where is your cabin? Number 609. 609... Wow! It's the same as my birthday. Birthday? When I travel I put my initials and birth date on all my suits and pants. What a man, initialling your pants... KK609. If they find this code the first-class hotels where I stay all over the world contact me at once. You just forget things a lot, don't you? Huh? He's... No way! What was that? Detective! No, no, it's nothing! From now on, no one except me is allowed in this room. Understood. Crap. Kenta! Brother... oh! He's asleep. Kenta! Oh! Yuuta, what is it? Well, I was checking out the security system, right? A guy in a white suit was there. A white suit... It's Detective Kazamatsuri! Oh, you know him, Kenta? Here. Detective Kazamatsuri. Number one arrest rate! The god-like super-skillful detective! Wow... that's awful. No, even in the worst conditions, the K-Lion will fall into our hands. And we have the Great Phantom Thief too! Phantom Soros. ...we'll join his ranks! ♪ We'll join his ranks in Jamaica~ This is the Hosho family's private lounge, the Reiko Suite. Travelling by boat really is nice, isn't it? It's like travelling in a house. Yes. The welcome party will be held over here. Please call me if you need anything. Thank you. You brought money? For shopping in Singapore. In dollar bills, for the time being. What's that? It's the "Siren's Tear". As my lady is on this ship, I made sure to bring it with us. It's a Hosho family tradition. Oh, so it's the usual talisman for protection on a journey? Huh? Isn't this the same as the thing Detective Kazamatsuri showed me? The same security system? It's a Hosho Group security device. He just borrowed it. The computer monitoring the system is the same as well. What, it's one of ours? And the detective said it was his own idea. Anyway, my lady, the party will start soon. That's right! I should get changed quickly. Thank you so much. The fireworks are starting shortly so please make your way outside. Kageyama, who is it that the eyes of everyone here are being drawn to right now? Of course, that would be- I'm not winning anything! How much money do I have to put in? ...isn't it that woman over there? What's up with her? Jeez... Maybe she's Ebisu-sama? Ebisu-sama? Smiling Ebisu Shopping Arcade's lottery prize is a ticket for this ship. The winner comes at this time every year. There are all sorts of people here, aren't there? - That's right. Rinko. Oh, good, Reiko-sama. This is my daughter, Rinko Oh, is that so? Oh, it's beautiful! It's a special programme for the last cruise. I can't believe it! Unbelievable! Oh! My sweet Shourei-san! Meeting in a place like this must be an offshore miracle. Ocean miracle! Huh? So you're with Shourei-san again, are you? One more please! 1, 2, 3! Somebody fell overboard! Rudder port, stop engines. Stop engines! It's an emergency. Stop them at once. Stop engines! We have stopped because of a passenger overboard. Reserve power will switch on soon. Please remain calm. So a geode is... Huh? A power cut? It's our chance! Let's go and get the K-Lion! Go! ♪ Let's get the K-Lion... - Kenta! Detective! Hey, detective! The security system has stopped because of the power cut. What? What are you saying? I will watch over the K-Lion! No, wait! I'll go. Shourei-san, please wait a moment. As expected from Detective Kazamatsuri, his footwork is different. What about the security? Oh, I'll check it. Okay! Please relax. I will protect the K-Lion with my life. That was close... As expected from Kazamatsuri, he reflects the criminal mind back on itself. Oh, like a mirror. Lower the lifeboat as soon as we've stopped. Yes yes yes yes... Security, OK! Kageyama, where were you? I was patrolling the room... Oh no, Shourei-san, what a disaster! But I, Kazamatsuri, have come back, so please don't worry. Detective, would you come to the medical office? What is it this time? I'm finally with Shourei-san... They brought up the man who fell overboard so they need you as a witness, detective. It was just an accident. No, but, the captain really wants a detective there. Fine, then I'll call my junior, Hosho-kun. What? - Shourei-san. Please wait a moment. Um, it was room 609. KK609! Wait! My lady, hurry up! Six! It's this way. 6, 6, 6... 6! Excuse me! Excuse me! My lady, there's no time... Hello? Excuse me. KK609! Hosho-kun. Hosho-kun! Is something wrong, detective? I have the perfect job for you. Quickly, come to the deck. Okay. The prince of the kingdom of Darwenel, known as the world's wealthiest country, is returning home after spending 5 years abroad. Good evening. Oh, you made it. Detective, my apologies for calling you here. This is the ship's doctor, Dr Yuuki. Hello. Dr Yuuki, let me dedicate all my efforts to you Sorry, but I already have 3 boyfriends at the moment. That's fine. From now on, you'll only need me. Was this a suicide? Look, this is a gunshot wound. Oh. So... Murder? - Oh! But there's something strange about this corpse, isn't there? After the criminal fired the gun they threw the body into the sea... But why did they put a life jacket on him? That's what I was just going to say! Yes yes yes yes... I've noticed something. What is it? Why is this corpse wearing a life jacket? That's what we just said. But there's no bullet hole in the life jacket. So after the criminal shot him, they must have put the life jacket on him deliberately. Huh? By the way, why are you here? Oh, uh... This person is, um... a private detective. Private detective? Pleased to meet you again. My name is Kageyama. Oh, a private detective. In other words, you're an amateur. Now get out! Leave! In that case, I'll get back to my date with Shourei-san. No, wait. We can definitely investigate together. Mr Private Detective. Well, anyway. We'd better inform the police. We'll have to stop the cruise and dock at the nearest port. It can't be helped. Dock? Yes, well... all the passengers and crew need to be interviewed and have their rooms inspected. Inspect the rooms? Oh! You're the one who broke this wing, right? The story fits... give yourself up. No, I didn't... This guy doesn't know when to give up... he's the worst. Detective, this is disgraceful. Huh? For the crime of property damage you're under arrest! Nooooooooo! We can't! We can't return to port! Huh? But, Detective... The criminal could escape! Furthermore, I shall arrest the criminal myself! Let's have a case meeting right away! The murder victim was Singaporean investor Raymond Yeoh, aged 68. He was listed in "Global Economy" as one of the 100 richest people in the world. A murder on this ship... Let's dock in a nearby port after all. No, no, please wait a minute, captain. Captain, this was faxed to the bridge. "Continue as scheduled to Singapore." "Release the crew and passengers immediately when you arrive in port." "Attempting to make any contact with local authorities is absolutely forbidden." "Failure to follow the rules will result in another casualty." A warning from the criminal. The transmission source? Somewhere on the ship. I see. So that means the 3000 passengers and crew are all hostages. It's a sea-jacking without the appearance of the criminal. Sea-jack? That's it! Sea-jack! We definitely cannot return to port! It's still 7 days to Singapore... The criminal... is definitely on board this ship. The last cruise... how can something like this happen? What is it? Is something wrong? Oh, no. It's nothing. Hey, what shall we do? When this cruise is over. What? We haven't decided things properly. Oh... that's right. Then let's discuss it properly next time. Our future. Yeah. Reiko-san! You're still at work this late? Yes, well... To avoid panic, I told the passengers it was a suicide. I want crews stationed on both sides of the ship. 24 hours. The safety of the passengers comes first. We must identify and catch the criminal as soon as possible. This is the victim's cabin, Raymond Yeoh. What is this outfit? What do you mean? I'm a private detective. Wait, aren't you going to investigate? Get changed immediately. What are you arguing about, Glasses? You don't have a hierarchical relationship. No hierarchical relationship... That's it... What about this window? Oh... well, the scene was preserved. So since last night, it was only opened this far. Yes yes yes yes... I can see just how it was at the time. Isn't it scary? The criminal burst into Raymond Yeoh's room, shot him dead, put the life jacket on the corpse and dropped it into the ocean. But the people watching fireworks below saw the corpse as it fell and it ended up being retrieved. But why did they bother with the life jacket... We should be able to clear that up with the investigation. He's so composed... He just doesn't know anything. Let me through? I want to check the balcony. Sorry, hold on a second-- Casual speech? Listen, don't get carried away. I'm the master and you are the servant. My apologies, my lady. But to keep the detective from finding out, it breaks my heart, but I must speak to you casually. Liar! You're enjoying it. Matsushige-kun, there's a problem. What is it? You're panicking. We're being flooded with requests from passengers. Requests? 3 missing children, 7 missing items, injuries, even cabin problems. It's complete chaos. Can't you send me some people from your section? Our staff are a bit busy with a security issue, so... I see. This is when you need a private detective, right? Oh, there's one here. Please take your time, Kageyama-kun. Even without your help, we'll catch the criminal as soon as possible. And tomorrow my holidays will begin at last. I understand. But it's a shame... If you carry on like this you'll definitely end up lost in a maze. I'm sorry to say this, but... Get a move on. It can't be... So it's turned out like this... What should we do? If this continues... Everything's already prepared. We just have to do it. As my lady says, working hard every day is very tiring. This is not really a proper holiday, is it? It's fine. Getting your nails done, going shopping, Every day and every night, cancelling everything... Your first paid vacation has turned into such a troublesome trip... When will my lady be able to go on holiday... I'll tell you! I'll tell you all about the investigation, so please tell me your theories. Understood. First I gathered eye-witness reports from around the crime scene, and... A suspicious man? Right. After the power cut started I saw a long-haired man with a walking stick running towards the suite room floor. Isn't it unusual to run in the dark? Detective. It was immediately after Raymond fell overboard, too. There's no question. It was the culprit running away! A long-haired man with a stick? That's right. That man is an important suspect at this stage. Is something wrong? Oh... no, no. And that's how the suspect first came to light. Well? What was the shipboard detective doing? I was helping someone who had dropped their ring in the pool. You dived in to search for it? Wasn't that tough? No. I quickly found it by the poolside, so after I finished work I had a first-rate tea time. While we were frantically investigating, you were playing around! No, my lady. This is also part of the investigation. Liar. It has nothing to do with investigation. My lady, please calm down and continue your story. After that, I met Makurazaki Mitsuki, who edits the shipboard newspaper. Ah. It's this paper that they publish every day, isn't it? Right. It's a pamphlet that reports that day's information about the ship. I also read it with pleasure. These articles introducing the crew are particularly interesting. Anyway, in an interview for that paper, she met with Raymond Yeoh. He was laughing? He was sort of grinning, and when I asked him why, he said "I just met someone interesting." "Someone interesting"... an interesting person. Well, who on earth was that? I don't know, I didn't ask anything else about it. Well, to begin with, why was Raymond on this ship alone? To meet Kyogoku Noboru, the heir of a soy sauce manufacturer. He said they had arranged to play poker together. Kyogoku Noboru? By the way, I am the heir to Kazamatsuri Motors, you know? Is that so? If you switch from this ship to travelling by car, you can ride in my passenger seat any time. Then I met that Kyogoku Noboru. Well, that person was just a gambling friend, you know. This time we'd planned to play poker again, but then that happened. What would you like, sir? Singapore sling, please. Me too. - Got it. Was there anyone who held a grudge against Raymond? Do you know about anything like... that?! Oh, you surprised me. Well, if you mean enemies, he had plenty. There was that M&A scam a long time ago. They say a lot of money fell into his hands from that. Right? Yes... He struck at the world of naval industry, and drove Hong Kong's Lee Financial Group to bankruptcy. There are rumours about his activities, too. Aside from all that, do you know of anyone who has cash with them? I'm having trouble finding someone to play with, and it's no good, you know? I want to do something exciting. Right? Yes... I even went to this much effort... Checking this in was difficult! Right? Yes... He's a complete rich idiot, isn't he? There's someone just like him who I know very well... Who? Exactly at that time, I was... Number 25... come on! No more bets. - Watch out! You made me bet on the wrong one! Jeez. My apologies. I was working at the casino's mascot, a character called "Black Jack-kun". Red 27. Congratulations, you're a big winner. You're so lucky! Oh... right. You were even in that kind of place? Jack-kun's bold appearance... I couldn't help liking it from the first time I saw it, so I asked him to switch with me. Well, we investigated thoroughly, and that's more or less all we found out. Anyway, why on Earth they put a life jacket on him... That's the mystery, isn't it? Well, Kageyama? Did you notice anything? Ah... No. Come on! You want to say something, so please tell me. Well... Excuse me, my lady. Your investigations were extremely well done. However, as for the truth behind this incident, this time I have no idea at all. What?! Is something wrong? You're not going to insult me? You can't see the truth behind this incident? Of course, if there's not enough evidence the mystery can't be solved. This time, the criminal is quite intelligent. No way... Where are you going? To feel the evening breeze. [singing in Chinese] What are you singing? Reiko-san. Something my father sang to me when I was a child. Todo-san? I've been on this ship for as long as I can remember. We were always alone, so he used to sing it when I was lonely. I see... Sometimes I made friends with customers around my own age, but they always left when we reached port. In the end they just smiled and said "bon voyage". "Have a nice trip"? The people I thought were my friends just said that and left. But who was the man you were with before? Your boyfriend? Oh! He's been on this ship for about six months. The cook's apprentice, Ishikawa Tenmei. I'm actually waiting to meet him now, to talk about our future. Since it's the last cruise, maybe he'll propose? Oh, no! I'm happy for you. You found someone to be with you forever. That's right. I'm sorry. Is Reiko here? Is something wrong? Ishikawa-san has disappeared. He didn't turn up for his shift either. Our guys have been looking for him since this morning. Oh, he's just been enjoying an overnight adventure in someone else's room... Detective! Rinko-san. Has Ishikawa-san seemed different lately? Actually, the other day he was looking around a lot and seemed kind of distracted. It's possible that he was involved in the incident. At any rate, let's search for him again. Kenta, there's a problem! Apparently the guy who went overboard was murdered and someone else has disappeared. ♪ This could be a good course of events. ♪ If there's more chaos our chance will definitely come. ♪ If security is weakened That will be our chance to steal the K-Lion! As expected from my brother ♪ K K K-Lion And more importantly ♪ You got hold of that transceiver ♪ So we'll be able to hear the ship's reports ♪ by direct, direct, direct transmission! Someone had just dropped it here. Rather than dropped, don't you mean they left it? No, they dropped it. Even though her boyfriend is missing... She doesn't want to take a break from the stage. I see. She's his only daughter, so the manager can't help worrying about her. Excuse me. Thank you. Manager! - Todo-san! Father? Father! - Todo-san! Father! Father! Father! Todo-san. Could I talk to you for a moment? Rinko, please go back to work. I'm fine now. The water that Todo-san drank may have been mixed with a cardiotonic drug. A dangerous medicine that can cause strokes in healthy people. What? Someone may have taken it from the medicine cabinets. There was one tablet missing. You mean someone tried to kill Todo-san. It can't be... Does anyone come to mind? Manager. You should tell them. Captain... What do you mean? Actually, I heard something from Manager Todo. He saw a long-haired man carrying a stick. Long-haired with a stick... Like the man seen running away from Raymond Yeoh's room. Why didn't you tell us this? It might have been Phantom Soros. Phantom Soros?! The truth is, Phantom Soros concealed himself on the ship 18 years ago. Soros was on this ship? Nothing happened so it wasn't publicly announced. Only a few people knew the truth. Who is Phantom Soros? You don't know? Phantom Soros is the world's greatest phantom thief. He recently stole one of Vermeer's masterpieces in Amsterdam, a blood opal in Madrid, and recently in New York he magnificently stole King Solomon's chalice. Apart from his criminal statements, he never leaves any evidence behind. Everyone knows his name, but nobody knows his true face. As expected, you know all about him, doctor. What was Soros's target 18 years ago? Well... we don't know. Soros was injured by the security guards chasing him, and disappeared into the sea. So Soros failed that badly in his younger days... Actually, at that time, I caught a fleeting glimpse of Soros too. He had long hair, and he was carrying a stick. Then, could it be that Raymond Yeoh was murdered by Soros? Is that what you mean? It's no good. Let's give up on the plan. But this is the last part... I'm going to do it. Definitely. You mean, you saw Soros as well, my lady? That's right. I remembered during that last conversation. 18 years ago, I was on this ship then too. It was night, the sound of alarms woke me up, and there was someone with an injured arm crouching there... Excuse me. Oh... my lady. You haven't seen anyone suspicious, have you? No, I haven't. My apologies for disturbing your sleep. You're hurt. I met Soros too. That's why my father forbade me from boarding this ship for 18 years. How enviable. I would like to meet him as well. What a careless thing to say. Anyway, tomorrow we'll investigate all the cabins, and straighten everything out. There are 987 cabins in all, I'm overwhelmed. Then perhaps you should try speaking to this person first? He may provide some useful information. Let me see... Since this ship departed, there are only two rooms where we haven't changed the towels or sheets more than once or twice. Wh-wh-what do you want? We're trying to relax. Excuse me, Koenji-san. We're just checking the security, so we're looking at all the rooms that haven't been cleaned. It's fine, it's fine. Our room is fine. Well, you're nervous about something. What are you hiding? Huh? A ship? We-we-we're directors and screenwriters. At the moment we're writing a script that takes place on a luxury liner. That's right! Only a few film connoisseurs would have heard of us. We're unknown hit movie-makers. We're the Coen... ji brothers. The other room is over here. The person staying here is a man from Hong Kong. Oh! What is it? This... this is... Long hair! Could this be... Phantom Soros? If our opponent is Soros, he may be armed. What should we do? Shh... I have no idea what that means. Understood. Charge! Aaah! It's Ishikawa Tenmei. No... A broken chair... Perhaps this is proof that the culprit struggled with Ishikawa before killing him. But why is he naked and kneeling down? Rinko! Please wait! Rinko-san... Please tell me one thing. Last night you were looking for Ishikawa-san all night, weren't you? Yes. Is there anyone who can confirm... that?! Wait a minute, detective! What do you mean? I noticed something. Why was he kneeling down when he died? He may have been killed while he was apologising during a lovers' quarrel. Are you saying I'm a suspect? Just that the possibility is... there! I'm sorry. As police officers we have to question everyone, so... I thought we were friends... The person staying in that room is one Michael Kwan. Long hair? Could this person be Phantom Soros? We found this in the room. It's small, but we collected a trace of explosive powder. Explosives? Why would there be... Perhaps Soros has a grudge due to the events of 18 years ago, and came on this last voyage to take revenge by blowing up the ship. My lady, as a change of pace this evening, shall we have dinner in the restaurant? A special seat has been prepared for you. My lady? "Death to those who learn the secret." I met Soros too. He never leaves any evidence behind. Yes? Kageyama-san, there's a problem. We've just received another fax from Soros. And? "I have taken Hosho Reiko. Leave 1 million dollars in cash on the helipad by 10 o'clock. Stay away until you have the money ready. Failure to follow the rules will result in her death." The crew are searching for her already, but there's no cash on board the ship. The ransom... I will prepare it. Hosho-sama! Ow, ow. Forget about security! Find Reiko-sama as soon as possible. It's here, it's here, it's here! The one chance in a million! Hosho-san! Hosho-san! Hosho-san! Yuuta, hurry up. Get on with it. Do it fast, or I'll knock your block off. Okay. You are Kyogoku Noboru-sama, aren't you? Yes, what is it? I have a request. Would you lend me 1 million dollars? I will definitely return it. Since you'll definitely return it, I'll lend it to you. Do you expect someone you've just met to answer like that? In that case, This is five hundred thousand dollars. Will you play a game with me? Let's do it. Thank you. Oh, Kenta, it opened. Hey, be quiet! What will you do if someone comes? Sorry. What did you say? - It's open. Yuuta, you did it. At last, we can confront the K-Lion! Amazing... I'm dazzled! Huh? The wing is broken, isn't it? Huh, you're right. No... Yuuta. Listen carefully. This... is art. Minimum bet is $100,000. No upper limit. Did you find her? - No, I can't find her anywhere. Damn it. Nothing in the boiler room. Bet 100,000. Fold. Hey, Yuuta! What the hell are you doing? How long is this going to take? Just a bit longer. All in. 300,000. Call. Kageyama-sama. Ace high flush. Wait-- wait a minute. Look at mine too. Full house, eights over aces. Kyogoku-sama wins. Thanks a lot. Oh, you're... My luck's been running strong since that roulette game. My baccarat winnings... This is 1,100,000 dollars. It's because your luck rubbed off on me. Please, use this. Hold on a minute. Who gave you permission to speak so freely? This is no good until it's changed into cash. Why does it matter while you're betting? But... - It's all or nothing. Isn't that the true meaning of gambling? If you win, pay me back with interest. I will definitely pay you back. Bet 100,000. Oh! What? What? What? You didn't touch the sensors, so... Why?! What is that? All in. A million at once? Oh no, oh no, Yuuta, quick, run, quick! Yes! Yes, yes... yes, yes, yes. We're sorry! Yes...! Don't move. Yes... This is Kazamatsuri! The K-Lion is fine, turn off the alarms. I am arresting you for attempted theft and vandalism. Huh? Vandalism? Because of the broken wing, of course. Call. All in. What will you do if you lose? Ah... Shall I tell you something good? You don't have much time, do you? This is gambling, you know? You win or you lose. If you're hasty, you'll lose. Thanks a lot. Four queens. Kageyama-sama wins. You did it! Wait, one more hand! One more, okay? I think it would be better to stop here. Apparently in gambling, you win or you lose. If you're hasty, you'll lose. An impression? You're mocking me? I'll be waiting for my interest. Of course. Huh?... wasn't that the company's money? Yes... Well... that's fine. Right? Yes... "The hostage is in the first lifeboat to starboard." My lady! Kageyama! Kageyama, run away. Please run away, Kageyama! I won't leave you behind, my lady! Kageyama... My lady, I sincerely apologise for being unable to protect you. I am happy to have been able to work for you, my lady. Kageyama... "Continue as scheduled. Any attempt at a rescue or conducting of an investigation will not be tolerated. Failure to follow the rules will result in another casualty. Phantom Soros." Captain. Continue on please, towards Singapore. Yes, sir! Jeez... the fire won't light at all. Kageyama! I'm here. Will someone come to rescue us? Please do not worry, my lady. I am a certified survivalist, with a top level "survi-cert" qualification. Survi-cert? That's right. This may be an uninhabited island, but with our current supplies, we could live here for 5 years. Five years... At least having you here with me is reassuring. That's kind of you to say. Now Soros will be able to do as he likes. What do you mean? Well, this was all Soros's doing, wasn't it? We were lucky that the bomb didn't go off, but now he has finally got rid of everyone who saw him. What is it? Oh... nothing. Come on, just say it straight out. It's just the two of us, so there's no need for secrets. Are you sure it's alright? You risked your life to save me. I'll accept whatever you say. Then may I just mention one thing? Of course. Excuse me, my lady. Yes? Was your brain tissue shipwrecked? Did your faculties run aground? Such stupidity requires an SOS. You need to be rescued. But these extreme conditions are terrible. Why did I lay down my life for someone like this? I cannot explain it to myself at this moment. What was that? I, who was slightly moved, am now so embarrassed. From the border between life and death to being insulted on a deserted island? Impossible, unbelievable, I can't go on like this! You're fired! You're definitely fired! Fired fired fired fired fiiiiiired! You may say that I am fired, but if you fire me here, what are you going to do? I have a request. Could you explain it so that even I can understand? Understood. However, this explanation is a little complicated. It's a little early to solve the mystery, so let us wait until after this "deserted island special" dinner. Such a brilliant detective. And you... When you charged into the crime scene, you used me... as your shield? Oh, that. I was just trying to let you take some credit. Please relax and let me handle things. In the end, the one who will arrest Soros is me, Kazamatsuri. Oh! Hey, you in the white suit! What are you doing? Well... my grip was a bit complicated... What do you mean, complicated? That was a wild pitch! Sorry. To explain this incident, let me say that from the beginning this was not the work of Phantom Soros. Huh? But... wasn't it Soros who kidnapped me? No, that was somebody else's crime. In the first place, that time bomb was a dummy with no detonator. That is, the culprit was not concerned with taking your life, my lady. Not concerned... Then what on earth did the culprit want? That was probably the "siren's tear". Siren's tear... that protection stone? Yes. The "siren's teardrop" is the world's highest-quality raw blue diamond. It is said to be worth 5 billion yen. That much? In the age of exploration, it was originally a treasure fought over by pirates. It is said that it brought wealth to whoever possessed it, but that it was lost in an accident at sea. The authorities at the time all searched for the stone. For a long time, it was an heirloom of Hong Kong's Lee Financial Group, until the master obtained it at auction. After that, when my lady boarded the ship, I brought it with us, of course. Because it always protected me... If we assume that the criminal was after the siren's tear, the entire mystery becomes clear. What do you mean? The first incident to occur was the murder of Raymond Yeoh. The key point was why the culprit made it so easy to recover his body by dressing him in a life jacket. That's right. That life jacket was a puzzle. But if you think about it logically, the answer is clear. That is, the culprit wanted the rescue to take place. What? The steering method when someone falls from a ship is the same throughout the whole world. Turn the rudder as far as it will go in their direction and stop the engines. This is to avoid catching the fallen person in the ship's propellers. However, the ship's engines also serve as its generators. Stopping them also stops the power supply. It takes up to 45 seconds to switch to the backup generators. 45 seconds? The time is set by ship equipment regulations. That must have been the criminal's aim. To start the rescue operations, and stop the power supply within the ship. But why cut the power? In order to steal the siren's tear, of course. Oh, to turn off the security system? That's right. The security system has a dual structure using infrared sensors and an electric lock. However, both stop working if the power supply is cut. Once the power was cut, the criminal would have 45 seconds before the backup generators switched on. In that moment, he planned to take the chance to steal the siren's tear. But the criminal failed to steal the siren's tear. Why is that? When he was about to enter the Reiko Suite, Michael Kwan happened to come across him. It was immediately after that when I rushed onto the scene, and Kwan and the criminal both left. Then, the criminal followed Kwan, discovered his true identity, Ishikawa Tenmei, and began plotting to kill him. What? Hold on. Are you saying that Ishikawa Tenmei, the man who was killed, was Michael Kwan? Oh. You hadn't realised that, my lady? Ishikawa Tenmei and Michael Kwan were the same person. It was just a disguise. Oh, you're right. But why was Ishikawa in disguise? That is because Ishikawa Tenmei also wanted to steal the siren's tear. Ishikawa did? Do you remember the report we received from Interpol? Oh, when the detective said there was probably an internationally famous thief on board? I believe that thief was Ishikawa Tenmei. What? Ishikawa Tenmei had heard that you were going to board the ship, my lady. He came on board as an apprentice cook six months earlier to prepare to steal the siren's tear. That is why he got close to Manager Todo's daughter, Rinko-san. He used the master key to break into the Reiko Suite, He studied the exact position of the pedestal for the siren's tear. And on this cruise, he used a counterfeit passport to board as Michael Kwan. He reserved the room directly below the Reiko Suite, and drilled holes in the ceiling below the security platform. He planted explosives in these holes to make the platform drop down. so that he could steal the siren's tear. I see... We certainly did find explosives in that room, but isn't the rest just your imagination? Yes. But if we assume that Ishikawa Tenmei drilled those holes in the ceiling, we can explain his puzzling kneeling position. After killing Ishikawa, the culprit noticed the drill, explosives and the holes in the ceiling, and realised Ishikawa's plans. If he had left the crime scene looking as it did, Ishikawa's plan to steal the siren's tear would be discovered. Security would be tightened, and it would be harder to steal it himself. The culprit desperately covered up the evidence. Lastly the ceiling holes needed covering. The chair Ishikawa had stood on was broken, and there was nothing else to use as a platform. So the criminal... You're saying he used the corpse as a platform? Yes. In the kneeling position, his calves, thighs and finally his torso provided three levels of height. This was the most effective position to use as a human platform. Hold on. They didn't need to do that, though. In this room, you could use this bed, or this sofa, couldn't you? You would expect them to use these as platforms. No, my lady. These things cannot be moved. That's not true. Like this... Huh? On a ship, in case they move around when the ship is rolling, large pieces of furniture are often held down with screws. Therefore, the criminal had no choice but to use the corpse as a platform. Thus, the corpse's kneeling position was created for this reason. But why was the corpse naked? I shall explain that later. When did you come up with this theory? While I was preparing the money for your ransom playing poker in the casino. At that time, my fingertips were sticky, and the security alarms went off. It was then that I first realised the plan to steal the siren's tear. I reached this conclusion by reasoning from those facts. Just from that? How did you reach your conclusion? Unfortunately, it seems we will have to interrupt this explanation. Helicopters again? Lady Reiko! Are you unharmed? Karasawa? He was taking care of things during my absence. Karasawa-san noticed what was happening quickly, after all. How did he notice? Probably because, on the bottom of my lady's shoes, there is a GPS showing this location. GPS? But I... are these always attached to me? The GPS had stopped on this island, so I hurried here just in case. You should respect my privacy -- But you really had drifted ashore on a deserted island, but you're safe now. I'll fly you directly to Singapore. Well, Karasawa, thank you for tidying up. What? We have to return to the ship at once. Let's go, Kageyama. Huh? What? Wait... My lady! Hey... Kageyama? Karasawa, we will definitely send someone back to get you later! I shouldn't have put out the fire. Kenta. - Hm? Thanks for everything. What? Ever since our parents died, you've looked after me. Yuuta. I'll say this now since it's all over. The people you thought of as your mother and father... The truth is... No, it will take too long. But I want to know... Yuuta. It's too early to give up yet! Ow, that really hurt. This is my last trump card. That's--! Todo-san. Reiko-sama. Kageyama-san. I'm glad you're unharmed. Do you have a moment? Is something wrong? This treasure, the pride of the Hosho family, the siren's tear has been stolen. But... it's right there. This is... a carefully-made imitation. Glass? Todo-san. The culprit was you, wasn't it? No... what? You mean, I stole it? Yes. And furthermore, you were behind this entire series of crimes. Kageyama-san, what are you saying? When Raymond fell into the sea, wasn't I with the two of you? That's right. Todo-san couldn't have been behind Raymond Yeoh falling overboard. He certainly had a conclusive alibi. But that time, if he dropped him overboard indirectly, It is possible that he caused his fall into the sea. How? Immediately after Raymond Yeoh's corpse fell, a swimming ring fell after him. My reasoning started from there. The window in the room where he was murdered was open by 20 cm. The balcony's handrail was scratched in two places. Combining these facts, I was able to reason as follows: First, Todo-san, you killed Raymond Yeoh with a gun that you secretly brought on board. Using a rope and the largest swimming ring from the pool, after dressing him in the life jacket, you used the rope to tie the corpse to the ring, and hang it over the balcony. Then you held the corpse in place by closing the window on the ring. Finally, leaving a 20 cm gap in the window, you made a small hole in the ring so that its air would escape. When the ring became smaller than 20 cm wide it popped through the gap in the window and let the corpse drop. If that were the case, it would certainly ruin your alibi, but would it really go that smoothly? Yes. There's no mistake. How can you be so sure? Because I tried it myself. Black Jack-kun? Yes. When I tested it with the same weight as the corpse, it took 20 minutes to fall after I pierced the swimming ring. So when Raymond Yeoh fell before our eyes and those of Todo-san, Todo-san had set up his alibi, and headed for the Reiko Suite. However... because of the unexpected appearance of Michael Kwan, you were unable to steal the siren's tear. Furthermore, when you realised that Kwan was really Ishikawa Tenmei, you ended killing him. Thus, with your plans ruined, you stole the cardiotonic drug and mixed it with your own drink, to pretend that Soros was targeting you. That was all a charade? Then, Todo-san, you implemented a new plan to steal the siren's tear. The key people were those two men who gave eyewitness testimony. Todo-san realised they were petty thieves trying to steal the K-Lion. Those two were after the K-Lion? Certainly, in their room, they had a map of the ship showing the K-Lion's position. Todo-san thought that he could use them in his plan to steal the siren's tear. How? First, he kidnapped you, my lady, and tied you up in the lifeboat. He sent a ransom demand from Soros. Then, when the search procedure started, he was able to naturally remove the K-Lion's security guards. Forget about security! Find Reiko-sama as soon as possible. With the transceiver you had let them take before, you leaked the guards' movements. The instant the security guards left, the thieves broke into the room to steal the K-Lion. Having made sure of that, Todo-san headed to the Reiko Suite. Meanwhile, I had removed the electronic lock and taken the money from the safe to the casino. But that was part of your trap, wasn't it? Perhaps you had oiled the doorknob or something like that, which enabled you to see the four numbers I had entered. You said that when you were playing poker your fingertips were sticky. You found out the key code, and unlocked the case. Now, only the infrared sensors remained. You switched the counterfeit that you had prepared with the real siren's tear, without regard for the sensors. But that would set off the alarms. He wanted them to go off. At that time, in Detective Kazamatsuri's cabin, the thieves were stealing the K-Lion. The security alarms went off throughout the ship, but nobody thought about the siren's tear. When the alarms went off, they assumed the K-Lion was being stolen. In addition, the petty thieves were at the crime scene, so it was assumed that they had set off the alarms. We're sorry. Finally, the obstructive young lady and I were dropped into the sea, and your plan was complete. And you, with nobody looking for the siren's tear, blamed everything on Soros and believed it was all over, didn't you? But this is all just in your imagination, isn't it, Kageyama-san? No. I have evidence. The fountain pen you currently have in your breast pocket. The neck of Ishikawa Tenmei's corpse had a stab wound of 1 cm in diameter, and there was a small blue stain on the floor. The shape of the wound and the unique smell of the ink... The welcome party will be held over here. ...could only have come from a fountain pen. You used the fountain pen to kill Ishikawa Tenmei. The ink you spilled on him then explains why you removed the corpse's clothes, doesn't it? That's why Ishikawa's corpse was naked. Examining that fountain pen should provide plenty of physical evidence. And now, the true siren's tear is in your possession. Todo-san. Why did you do this? It was all because of the Lee family, wasn't it? The Lee family? The dragon on the cap of that fountain pen is the Lee family crest. It must be linked to some important memories for you, Todo-san. So, while you knew that it was an important piece of evidence, it was not something you could throw away. This is only a theory, but isn't Rinko-san a daughter of the Lee family, who were once destroyed in the world of naval industry? And weren't you the Lee family's butler? How did you... I recognise a person who has the same profession as me. You have never once stood in front of Rinko-sama, and I sensed in you the moderation of a butler. Todo-san. It's all over. Over? If that's true, what now? My entire life, these 18 years! On our last voyage, the siren's tear finally came on board this ship. And Raymond Yeoh was a passenger as well. When I found out, I thought it was a miracle. My master was forced by that man to sell his loss-making company for a pittance. The Lee Financial Group was ruined in a moment. After that, they had to sell the siren's tear and their misfortunes continued. My master and mistress were burdened with an enormous debt, [singing in Chinese] To prevent the debt being placed on the young lady they decided to take their own lives. At that time, they entrusted the young lady to me. Someday, the Lee family will be restored. Understood. Please do not worry. On that day, I swore that someday I would get the siren's tear back and restore the Lee family. I concealed myself on this ship and waited for my chance to steal the siren's tear. And finally, the time came, and Raymond Yeoh was on the same cruise. My master and mistress must have been guiding me. To steal the siren's tear, I had to have a corpse. So I decided to kill that man. The Lee family? Oh yeah, I remember them. They offed themselves in the end, right? What a bunch of idiots. You haven't changed a bit. I'm relieved. I have no regrets about ending your life. But why did you kill Ishikawa Tenmei? I realised that Michael Kwan and Ishikawa were the same person, so I went to that room. Ishikawa-kun, isn't it? What are you doing? Todo-san. Oh, um... Actually... So I've been found out. Now I'll have to kill you. At that time, for the first time, I realised that Ishikawa planned to steal the siren's tear by drilling holes in the ceiling. Just tell me... Just tell me one thing. What is it? Rinko. Were your feelings for Rinko real? Are you stupid? I got close to her because she's your daughter. I just wanted your master key. He was deceiving my lady and stealing the Lee family's heirloom. I could not forgive that man. It can't be helped. Shall I drop you into the sea? How could you kill two people just for the sake of a jewel? Don't you understand anything? For 18 years, I concealed myself on this ship, feeling only hatred and resentment, dreaming of the day the siren's tear would fall into my hands. That was all I had in my life. That's not true. I enjoyed it, being able to be with my father. I loved my hard-working father. I was proud of him. You weren't only on this ship to take your revenge, were you? The 18 years we spent here... shouldn't you have better memories of them than that? Being with my father made me happy. Father. It was all my responsibility, Rinmei-sama. I sincerely apologise. Take him. Go! Yes, sir! Detective? Detective! You knew who the culprit was from the start, right? I couldn't even notice something like that. I'm so sorry! No problem. Don't worry about it. Nothing to worry about. Nothing... Um... and those two? That's right! These two are, well... Detective, if you use this the broken wing won't be a problem either, see? We kept it a secret that you were the one who broke it, so... We did, right? Oh, no no. These two are friends who I met on the ship. Friends? We're friends, right? Yay... [singing in Chinese] Hey! Father! I'm sorry. If the Lee Financial Group still existed, Rinko-san might be leading an entirely different life. My lady, how do you see the Rinko-san standing on that stage? What? People are often bound by their past or their standing in life. However, we can only live as we are now, doing our best to shine as ourselves. That is, each person living the happiest life they can live. Do not forget that. Reiko-san. Bon voyage. Bon voyage! Was it really okay to give me all the money you won by gambling? Of course. Thank you for helping to save me. Oh! Shourei-san, I found you! Well, excuse us. My sweet Shourei. Ah! Wait... your handkerchief! What do you think? I'm glad we prepared it after all. I'm looking forward to the captain's happy face... "Captain Kaibara, Thakns for all your hard work..." Huh? "Thakns"? What? Please take care of me from now on. Thank you for every time. You don't need to say "every time". Prince Balaji. I came to take you home. Prince? He is the future king of Darwenel Kingdom, the Crown Prince Balaji. No way! The truth is, for 5 years, I have been working and searching for myself, as is our custom. You should have said so earlier! It would have been a huge scoop for the ship's paper! But... where is Darwenel Kingdom? What? All that commotion, but Soros never even showed up, did he? This is... the handkerchief from that time! You're hurt. May I sit with you? Miss Soros. Soros? The great thief Phantom Soros never fails to steal his target. But you failed to steal the siren's tear 18 years ago, and you boarded that ship once more to to steal it at last, didn't you? What could you be implying? Soros would never let his target slip from his hands, much less forget something he had borrowed from a child. That's why you returned my lady's handkerchief. Returning the object you borrowed 18 years ago is the reason you let me borrow those chips in the casino, isn't it? I have no idea what you're talking about. You gave me a hint when the security alarms went off. When everyone turned to look at the speaker, you were the only one looking the other way. You were looking towards the Reiko Suite. That alarm had only sounded once before, 18 years ago, when Phantom Soros broke in. That is, when they heard that sound, the only person who could know it was the alarm for the Reiko Suite was Phantom Soros. That was my reasoning. You knew that I was Phantom Soros, but you still let me steal it? That was the best way to confirm that I knew the true form of Soros. Wasn't that a big risk to take? Did you think of that? It was an all-or-nothing gamble. Someone recommended that strategy to me. Apparently it's the true meaning of gambling. You're interesting, aren't you? You too. You're of great interest to me. The princess will be coming on board. I haven't smiled like this in a long time. Meeting you was fun. Perhaps next time I'll meet you directly at the mansion. Please come whenever you like. I'll be waiting for you. By the way... why here? That's because you took Detective Kazamatsuri's handkerchief from the bar last night. It was found by the cleaners of this hotel. What do you mean? KK609. If this mysterious number is found in a world-famous hotel they immediately contact Detective Kazamatsuri. And that happened here. That's... Somehow, that man is a miracle detective who Japan is proud of before the world. Hi everybody! I have travelled all this way as an envoy of the mayor of Kunitachi. Kunitachi Police Station's famous detective, Kazumatsuri Kyoichiro. And now I shall show you this item that I have guarded with my life, the K-Lion. Here it is! Hurry up, show us! This is... K... Lion! Oh dear. Let's escape. Yes! Sorry to have kept you waiting. Here. Thanks for your hard work. Why would the detective send me just to get something like this... And I didn't get to do anything at all while we were on the ship. Oh, but if we went on that...! It can't be helped. I guess you'll have to be my partner. I see. You want to reenact that famous scene, don't you? I'll agree to do it. Please excuse me. Go ahead, my lady. Don't hold back. Like this? You're remembering that scene, aren't you? Huh? Hey, why are you standing in front? Ah! Watch out! It's alright. I have... this to protect us. Wait, how did you get that? It really is beautiful. How did you get it back? Did you meet Soros? Tell me, Kageyama! Hey, hey! If you don't tell me I'll fire you. I'll definitely fire you! Fired fired fired fired fired! Fiiiiired!
