But no big surprise, and probably for the best. Is that it? Ten whole seconds of sympathy for dear old Dad, whose heart hanging out of his chest like a bag of trash? I am sympathetic Dad. Just not very surprised. Yeah, you know what? Neither am I, really. Yeah. So, to what do I owe the honour of being invited to beautiful downtown Hamilton on a Tuesday afternoon? Well, I'm just going to come out and say it. I may be in love, and I'm definitely gay. Wow. Wow. I never expected that. Does your mother know? Told her last week. Hm, and your sister? Yeah, of course. You're cool with this, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm totally cool with it. You know, it's just a bit of a change for me. You're still my little boy. My darling little boy that I used to carry on my shoulders when you were no bigger than a peanut. Yeah. Yeah. To maybe being in love to definitely gay, I mean... Ah, Jesus. Okay. I love you, man. Thanks, Dad. I love you, too. Okay. Okay, Dad. That's great. Yeah, it's great to maybe be in love, to be definitely gay. Okay. What do you keep looking at? Nothing. Nothing. And, you know, that's something that Linda never really understood. How good it is to be really in love. Because that's all we have in the end, you know? Love. The heart wants what the heart wants. Well, we really covered a lot for a little father-son chat, but I do have to eat, game day and all. So, what do you feel like? The steaks here are really good. Hey, you see number 23? That's my boy.

You gotta be fucking kidding me. Didn't I tell you when I got home I wanted you gone? And now, of course, here you are smoking fucking cigarette smoking in my house, in my fucking house, when you know fucking well that I hate the smell of fucking cigarette smoke. Now that's some fine language for a college professor to be using. What the...? Dad? Hello, Sam. What are you doing here? Well, I was having a quiet drink and a smoke? Should I put it out? No, no, go on. Enjoy the cancer. Can't hurt you now. You're still dead, aren't you? Yes, I am still dead, and no it can't. Nice looking place you got here. Thanks. You, on the other hand, you don't look so good. I know, I know, I know. Been going through kind of a rough patch. Such is life. Tell me about it. Just wait till you shuffle off this mortal coil. Funny you should mention old Hamlet. He was visited by the ghost of his dead father as well. Or was he? Right. Aye, there's the rub. You're either a ghost, or I'm even more fucked than previously believed. Does seem that way, but there's nothing yet broken that can't be fixed. Now, I hear you've been having a little marital trouble. Oh, yeah. She met somebody she prefers fucking, or maybe was just sick of my bullshit, if I'm being honest. You have to be honest with ghosts, don't you? Probably. She probably was sick of your bullshit, probably too young for you as well. Thanks, Dad. You know, I never saw a man go with so many women. Is that a mental thing, like some with the hand-washing? I don't know, Dad, maybe. And you with all those pretty wives waiting at home. Yep. There is definitely something wrong with you, son. That's very perceptive of you, Dad. I mean, really perceptive. And now that we're talking, you know, man to man, honestly about women... I want to ask you something. Why... Why did our mother leave us? And why did she leave you? That is the question. It's a very good question. Yeah? And what's the answer? I don't know. What do you mean you don't fucking know? You're a ghost. You're an all-knowing, supernatural... how can you... Ghosts know some things, and they don't know others. It's the same as people. What's the point of being a ghost, if you don't things? Hamlet's father came back, he knew loads of things. You don't know anything worth two shits. Do you know something? You're a terrible ghost. A fucking awful, terrible, lame, terrible fucking ghost. Easy. Alright. Alright. Let's get you to bed. I'm not tired. I know, love. Let's get to bed. Does anybody have a breath mint? I do sir. Laura, yeah. Oh, Certs. I haven't seen these for a long time. My mom loves them. Oh, of course she does, That's because they're two, two, two mints in one. Sure sir, whatever you say. What about that as poetry? "Two, two, two mints in one." Hmm? Anybody? Just for the sheer poetry of it. No? What about this one? "I will arise and go now, "for always night and day "I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; "While I stand upon the roadway, or on the pavements grey, "oh, I hear it in the deep heart's core." Where... where was I? Frank Scott's politics, sir. Frank Scott's politics. I put it to you that it is very difficult to understand Scott's politics without first considering The Great Depression, and the huge impact that that had on his generation, to witness a whole world thrown to the dogs by the forces of global capitalism. Anybody have a comment on that? Draw parallels? Hold forth? Anybody? What about you with the phone there, Mr. Clark? Oh, sorry. I would like to remind management that the drinks are watered, the hat-check girl has syphilis, and the band is composed of former SS monsters. However, since it is New Year's Eve and I have lip cancer, I will place my paper hat on my concussion... and dance. That was very impressive, everyone, but, um, specifically, how does Leonard Cohen's "The Music Crept By Us" refer to Frank Scott's politics? Excuse me, Professor O'Shea? You just recited "The Music Crept By Us". What does that have to do with Scott being a dirty commie rat? I don't understand, sir. I mean, all I said was that I don't know much about The Big Depression, so... That's enough... enough poetry for today. And the players on the ice, they were like... ice-skating angels. I saw an angel once... but I was on acid. Yeah, but I wasn't on acid. Yeah. Bonsoir. Merci. Yeah, but to my point, you know, maybe these are flashbacks. No, but they weren't flashbacks. It was more like a dream. Well... then we're back to my original hypothesis. Yeah, which is? That you're going batshit crazy, old friend. Or crazier, depending on one's perspective. But seriously, though, tomorrow, first thing, you go see a doctor, okay? Because I'm sure that there's some kind of obvious explanation, you know? Like... I don't know... chewing Vicodin and drinking hard liquor for the last 48 hours, and now, you're slipping in and out of some kind of trippy, booze-fueled psychosis. Yeah, yeah. You could be right about that. Speaking of, maybe you should take a little break. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. First thing tomorrow. Donny, can I get another one? Large. Thanks. Coming right up, Professor. Oh. Sorry. Oh, little bit early for Halloween, isn't it? Why don't I buy you a drink? You know, I don't want you to take this personally... I've never liked Halloween. Do you like Christmas? I love Christmas. Two cannibals were eating a clown. One say to the other, "Does this taste funny to you?" Do you get it? 'Cause it's a clown. "Does this taste funny to you?" Oh, Jesus, you're a hard crowd, Frank. ♪ Me and my wife are parted ♪ Gonna take a little stroll uptown ♪ ♪ Irene, goodnight ♪ ♪ Irene... ♪ Goodnight ♪ ♪ Irene ♪ ♪ Goodnight, Irene, goodnight ♪ Any changes is vision, speech or hearing? Aside from the hallucinations. Maybe. Look at the light. Any changes in mood, personality, or ability to concentrate? Well, I broke up with my wife on Tuesday, so I've been feeling a little bit low. Oh, sorry to hear that. Problems with memory? Um... What was the question again? That was a little joke. That was a little funny. And finally, problems balancing or walking? No, only when I'm really drunk. And are you really drunk very often? Um, lately, yeah. Which means? Oh, for the last few days and nights, I've been absolutely plastered, and a healthy consumption of alcohol for, oh... about 40 years. How many drinks a day? Five? Seven? 13? For the last 40 years? Mm-hmm. And for the last few days? 23. 39. Per day? Yep. Well congratulations, Samuel, you're lucky to be alive. That's what they keep telling me. And for once, they are correct. Well, you don't have all of the symptoms associated with cancerous brain tumors. And most of the symptoms you do have - dead father and singing students aside - can be explained by your alcoholism. Yeah, but I'm not an alcoholic. Okay, fine. So, you've been drinking to excess your entire adult life, but you're not an alcoholic. Good. Well, that's settled. Now, would you care to join me for a drink? No. I would not. Samuel, do you have anyone you can talk to about what's happening with you? Apparently not. Why don't you call me Sam? No. I meant close friends, family. Loads. Can barely swing a dead cat. Good. So, talk to them and I'll see you again on the eighth for our follow up, and we can go over the MRI results. It's a date. Goodbye, Sam. Fuck! Ce n'est pas assez blanc. It's still not fucking white enough. Sorry about that, Josée. You look white enough to me, kid. Papa, what are you doing here? I just came to see my favourite daughter. Perfect. You can take me to lunch, tell me all about your life going to shit. Sounds lovely. Alex, I'm taking lunch with my father, and when I get back, you need to figure out the motherfucking, cocksucking, not fucking white enough fucking problem! Okay, Josée. Josée, you don't need to use that kind of language. It's lazy. No, Papa, it's not lazy, it's these fucking assholes that I'm working with that are lazy. Huh? Ahh, okay. Do you want to go like that or should we change? Just give me five minutes, okay? Okay. Did you like it? No. I thought it was terrible. Shut up. You're the one who's terrible. No, I liked it, I did... what I saw of it. It's about the horror of marriage. Yeah, I picked up on that subtle thread. Mother says you caught Linda with another man. What? Your mother knows? Of course she knows. God, I specifically told Layton not to say anything. I'm surprised you remember anything you said to Layton. Is there no respect for frailty in this family? No respect for personal confidence whatsoever for... - Bienvenue. - Oh, Jesus Christ almighty! Est-ce que tout va bien? Yeah, you just gave me a surprise, that's all. Not to worry. Come this way. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, everything's fine. So, what else did she say? She laughed. She laughed? Your server will be here soon. Can I get you a drink? Um... Just water. A glass of white wine, please. So, what else did she say? That was pretty much it. She told me you caught Linda with another man, that you were getting another divorce, and then she laughed. But she did laugh a lot, and for a long time, so you know she cares. Oh, of course. Do you ever think about your life? What you've done, what you haven't done, the kind of man that you wanted to be? Um, no. But then again, I'm an 18-year-old woman, so... Yeah, of course. Was I a good father? I mean, I know... I know I had shortcomings, but the big picture? Well, you could have been around more, a lot more, especially after the divorce. Not for me. I'm more like you - I can take it. But for Layton. He's always been such a fucking pussy. Oh, God, do you have to talk about your brother like that? The language that comes out of your mouth sometimes... I blame your mother. She always swore like a fucking sailor. Well, she blames you. Yeah. So, you're even. Now, is there anything else you need to tell me? No, just another d-i-v-o-r-c-e... Et voila. - Thank you. - Avec plaisir. No wine? No whisky? What's the occasion? I-I just thought I'd cut down a bit. It's not a terrible idea. Yeah. So, what about you? You have any other news? Not much. I have a new boyfriend. - Oh. - Yep. God, everybody's got boyfriends - Layton, Linda... Linda... how could she do this to me? I don't know, Dad. Maybe because she's a fucking idiot. Hmm? Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. So, what we are looking at is an Astrocytoma tumour, Grade 4. It's a glioblastoma multiforme, that is covering and exerting pressure on both the frontal and the temporal lobes. Hmm. Is it... is that what's causing the hallucinations? I don't know, Sam. I can do more tests and try to find out, But what I do know, now, for sure, is that... this is one of the largest tumours I've ever seen, and it's growing on the parts of your brain responsible for thought, reasoning, behaviour, memory, hearing, vision, and emotion. Hm. Well, that's a relief. I hardly ever use any of that stuff. So... So, what's the solution? It's way too close to the brain to operate. If we had caught it earlier... But... what is the solution, Doctor? I won't lie to you, Sam - this tumour is only going to get bigger, and bigger, then, most probably, you... well, you're going to die. Oh. When? A couple months, maybe a year, but not much longer than that. So... there's no... hope? Well, radiation therapy could possibly give you more time. But in the best cases, the long-term survival rates for that type of cancer is about three percent. And you're not one of the best cases. Oh. Well, well, well, look what the cat's dragging in. Happy thanksgiving. Happy thanksgiving to you. Where's the lovely Linda? Working on her abs? No, she's working at somebody else's abs. Oh... Oh, oh, sorry. Oh, come here, you stupid man. Sorry. I'm okay. Yeah? I'm okay. Come on in. Hey, guys. - Hey. - Look who's here. Hey. What the fuck happened to you? Ah, you know, just part of the game. Should I be worried about you? No, you should be worried about the other guy, 'cause I knocked that little bitch out cold. Hey. Oh. Papa, this is Chad. And Chad, this is my dad, who teaches poetry. Get it, guys? Yeah, it's hilarious. Nice to meet you, Chad. Thanks. Can you get me a large, man-sized whiskey, please? I thought you were taking a break. Well, in the words of the immortal bard, "That was then, this is now." It's your funeral. Sure is. Yep, it sure is. Good old S.E. Hinton. Yeah. Yeah, I always had a soft spot for her. Me, too. I love The Outsiders, Rumble Fish. I mean, I even think Tex is good. Hmm. Book or movie? Movies are great, don't get me wrong, especially Rumble Fish. But I'm more a book man myself. Hmm. Book man. Yes, sir. I'm studying at McGill, English. I'm actually gonna be taking your class next semester. Listen, she's invited you to Thanksgiving dinner. Don't give me the bullshit. No, sir. I'm really interested in Canadian poetry, yeah, honest. I want to be a writer one day. Oh, God. Just when things seem to be going so well... I'm serious. It's all I ever wanted to do. Hmm. And here we are - one man-sized whiskey, full. A woman's work is never done. Death to the patriarchy. Death to the patriarchy. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, they barricaded themselves into my office and vowed not to leave. The director wanted me to call the police, but I said, "No." I ordered them pizza. I told the security guards to keep an eye on them, and we all went home for the weekend. Monday morning, they were gone. They left the office spotless, except one of them had left the a massive shit in my bathroom. I mean, that's it, that's the only protest. And that's what you get for being dean at a law school. So, what were your friends protesting this time? Big changes on Facebook? Sadly, we can't all be cogs in the neo-liberal capitalist war machine! I play hockey. So, what does that have to do with neo-liberal whatever? Bread and circuses, dear brother. They call the tune, and you dance on their ice, like a pretty little slut puppet. Okay, you be careful, okay? No, you be careful, asshole. There's a fucking war going on. Enough! Jesus. Can I ask you something, Jonathan? Have you ever come across a patient who suddenly starts to hallucinate things that you might see in a movie? Like a lion in a living room, that sort of thing. I read a case, a man, victim of a vicious attack, he woke from a coma, suddenly able to solve the most complicated mathematical questions. He was a driving instructor, had a high school education. But now, he sees a world of mathematics everywhere. The human mind is a strange, wonderful, terrible thing. It sure is. Excuse me for a second. When is your next game? Sunday. Okay. I could do with one of those. Jesus! You nearly gave me a heart attack. Sorry. Now, would that have been ironic or just a coincidence, in your professor opinion? I don't know, Dad. Maybe just bad luck. Grand. How 'bout that drink? You're a ghost, why would you want a drink? Maybe I'm thirsty. Hmm. Ask a stupid question... Here you go. Well, seems like I'm gonna die. Yeah, heard about that. From your bony friend in the next room? Word is out on the street. What's it like? It's like any other street, just a bit more ghostly. Dying. What's dying like? What's sex like? Or being in love? Or the snow falling? I don't remember you being so poetic or so cagey. Well, the kid questions - the moon is made of cheese, storks bring babies - it's not so tough. And what about Mom? How can you not know why Mom left you? I mean, what kind of a man doesn't know that? It's tricky, son, to know what's in another person's heart. Drinking alone, you know what they say? Yep. I know, I've got a problem. I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle. But if you need any help with it, Samuel, I do know people. I'll be okay, but thanks. Good. Okay. Well, I also wanted to tell you, um, we're going to make an announcement before dessert, Jonathan has asked me to marry him, and I said yes. God... I just wanted to tell you. Oh. Oh, that's... That's... That's great news. I'm really happy for you. Thank you. And I always thought you looked really, really sexy in white. Okay. - Really. - Yeah. What the fuck? You must be fucking kidding me. Just in case you're not... Oh! Grow the fuck up. You really blew it when you let that one go. Shut the fuck up, Dad. Hey, Mr. O'Shea. Fuck off. Hey, Mr. O'Shea, it's me, it's Chad. Chad, Josée's boyfriend from Thanksgiving. Oh, Chad! Yeah. It's you! Oh, it's good to see you, man. Oh! She's not here, is she? No, she's at home. I lost everything. So, don't you go down that path. No, don't worry, okay? I love her. I'll do the right thing, I promise. This'll fix you right up, huh? So, it's only after he gets back from Thailand, that his dad, right, his dead dad starts to appear to him as a ghost, and he starts to talk to him about life and death and everything, and they even start to work their shit out. But then, his old drug connections, you know, they come back, they... to track him down, you know? Yeah. Mm. My died when I was... when I was young... Oh. ...younger than... than you are. You know, it was fucking terrible because you're... you're just so alone. You know? Do you find that? Yeah. Well, no. I mean, my... my dad's still alive. It's only in the book that he's dead, so... You know something? I've always wanted to write a book... about all the crazy fucking things that have happened in my life. But then, you know, marriage, divorce, kids, and, I'll tell you, teaching other people's fucking books, man. and I never seem to be able to get around to it, and it's the one fucking thing I have always wanted to do. I... Holy fuck. You must follow your dreams, Samuel. You must follow them home. Yeah. Yeah. See you later. Huh? Yeah. You gonna be okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Listen, Brendan, thanks for looking after the old place for me. It's my pleasure. Should I teach your classes, too? Oh, that'd be great. I've just finished Milton Acorn, about to start on Margaret Atwood. Perfect. Love Margaret. It's my favourite Atwood of all the Atwoods. Anything else that I should tell the kids? Oh, I don't know. Tell them to look both ways before they cross the street. Words to live by. Yeah. Well, you're Ireland's problem now. Safe travels, old friend.

Well, you know what they say - dying's easy, comedy's hard. Clearly. Come on, we'll get you settled. So, what are we doing here? Me? I'm, uh... I'm reflecting on my life, my imminent death, and I'm writing the great North American novel. You. I have no fucking idea. Writing a book. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Are you even stupider than I thought? Probably. This is good, Dad. Mmm. Your cooking has improved. What are you talking about? I was always good in the kitchen. We used to eat this all the time. Don't you remember? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I remember everything, Dad. You and me, the old house in Dublin, and here. You know, when... Geneviève and I got divorced, and it was just me and the kids... ...I really started to think about you and me, and growing up without mom. And how the one thing that I never wanted to happen, 'cause I knew that it brought such a trouble, a broken family, that's the one thing that happened, You know, it's a funny thing, this life. Even with all the heart aches, you wouldn't change a thing. I wouldn't have changed a thing, not a single moment with you. Riding your bike. Putting some little picture on the wall. Except, of course, dying, and leaving you all on your own. My darling boy. It's okay, Dad. It's okay. Thanks. Hello. Bonjour. Oh, you're French. French-Canadian. Is that a problem? No, it's just... Do you ever get the feeling that God is laughing at you? All the time. What's today's punchline? Well, I just got off the plane from Montreal, and here you are, reading Leonard Cohen. Is this the part where we say, "It's a small world"? Exactly. God, it's a small world. Sure is. Are you, uh, are you enjoying this? Yeah, I am. It's trippy. '60s people, they liked it trippy. They sure did. Personally I've always been a big fan of The Favourite Game. Is that so? That is so. In fact, you could say it's my favourite. First God, and now your hilarious gags. We're just having ourselves a laugh riot. Yeah, we sure are. Mind if I ask you, like, what are you... what are you doing here? Don't mind. I ask myself that every day. And? And my mother's Irish from nearby. She bought herself this shop for something to do. And you? I have an old shack by the sea. It's been years. I just thought I'd come and look at the old place. See what's changed. I predict you'll find everything exactly the same. Could be worse. I've had quite a few changes lately. There you go. Thank you. Good luck with the sea. Enjoy the book. So, the big moment has finally arrived, Dad. What happened between you and Mum? I never wanted much. Wife, family. Decent job with decent pay. That the British Empire had never existed. My needs were simple. But her needs... They were a little more like yours. What the hell do you know about my needs? Jesus, boy. Anyone could take one look at you and know all about your needs. Just like your mother. And those needs, they were more important than me, than you, than anyone. And she followed those needs and we never saw her again, and that's what happened. But, dear God, I loved that woman. Jeez. That's a bit depressing. Hits too close to home. The truth often does. As a somewhat all-knowing ghost, what do you think it means, Dad? I'll leave that one to you, son. Good. I have no fucking idea. And I'm not like my mother. I'm nothing like my mother. Excuse me. Do you have hockey sticks? Oh, I'm sorry. We just sold the last one. Too bad. Actually, that was just a clever ruse to get to talk to you again. Oh, what was it that you wanted to talk about, again? Why don't we start with the basics? What's your favourite colour? You have done this before, haven't you? Oh, yeah. Many, many times. I'm kind of an operator. Wow. Well, in that case, yellow. What's next, Mr. Operator? Well, now we get to know each other through charming conversation. You ask me a question. - What's your favourite colour? - I don't have one. Man of mystery, wow. This just keeps getting better and better. What could possibly be next? I think that's it for conversation. Oh, no. Well, yeah. I think we've covered all the basics, all we need to know about each other. Well, what about your favourite vegetable? Your astrological sign? Your name? Samuel O'Shea. Charlotte LaFleur. It's nice to meet you, Charlotte. And now that we're so well-acquainted, would you like to go for a drink with me sometime? Why not? Let's go! But don't you have to look after the shop? Fuck no. So, what did you do back in old New York? A lot really. I modelled forever and then came my thirties, and that dried up, so I took my bags of model cash and I opened a restaurant with friends. And then my mom got sick, and now here I am. Hello, Charlotte. Hello, Kevin. How are things? Things are grand. Who's this then? Sam O'Shea, nice to meet you. Well, this has been nice, but bye, now. Bye, now. Who was that? Just a friend from the shop. So, uh... so where were we? - Bags of model cash. - Bags of model cash. So, are you gonna get the next drink then. Absolutely, but I should get home to Mother. Can I, um, can I give you a lift? No, I've got the van, but this has been fun. Really fun. Thanks, Samuel O'Shea.

She's such a bitch. She doesn't even care, he could be fucking dead. Sure, babe, but, you know, your mom, she's complicated. Yeah, and he's an asshole. A fucking asshole, leaving us like that. Sure babe, but your dad, you know, he's complicated. So, what's it like? What's what like? The stupid heroin, you're always stupid smoking. what's it really like? It's really like... Like God has a velvet tongue, and he's licking you all over, cause he loves you so much, cause you're so freaking awesome. Yeah? Hm. Well then, I guess I better try. That's my girl. Now, you just... breathe... it... in. Mm. Oh, my... Oh, God. What's wrong? I just... I don't know where to go next. I mean, I can feel the ending, I just can't see it. Why don't you go for a walk? Stir up those creative juices. Yeah, yeah. That's... That's not a terrible idea. Jesus Christ! Oh, my God. Get your coat, let's go. Where? To the police. - What for? - To find out who did this. I already know who did it. It was Kevin. Kevin who? Kevin from... Kevin from the pub. To tell you the truth, we had a little thing, and he's a little jealous. I thought it was settled, but I'll talk to him again. Believe me, it's better this way. I can handle it. Okay, okay. What do we do with that? Better take it to the dump before the flies get too thick. Just leave it. Just hang on for a moment. What the fuck do you want old man? You left something at my house. Go fuck yourself. Let me give you a piece of advice. You ever come near me, my house, or my woman again, and you'll be the one that will be fucked. Sam, what are you doing? Wants his deer head back. Hey, don't touch the fucking truck. Or what? What? What the fuck are you going to do about it? Yeah, just like I thought, you fucking coward. Well, well, well, look at you, Mr. Sexy Professor Man. I better get you home right away. So, we hit the ice, and the first skate 'round, the first guy I skate by. So, everybody's fighting and there's blood all over the ice. When it's all done the coach says, "What the fuck? What about winning's the best revenge?" And I said, "Well yeah, and we fucking won, didn't we?" Fucking kicked their asses. Fuck! Eh? I'm sure your father has a very good reason. Whatever that is. Bien. Joyeux Noel. Merry Christmas. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Merry Christmas. So, you've the two children? Josée and Layton. Great kids, the best ever. Mine too, though I only had the one, my darling young Charlotte here. Mother. And how many wives? Eh, two, both- both divorced. You got me beat again. I only had the one divorce, and the one marriage, thank God. And how old are you now? I'm sixty-four. You're one ahead of me again. I just turned 63 in November. We've so much in common. Maybe it's you and I should be lovers. Okay, you are crossing boundaries that should not be crossed. What? One last go around for your poor dying mother. Consider it an act of charity. This conversation's over. Well, truth be told, I had an older man after your father was gone, back in Montreal, and he was a dream. He was a bit slow to start, but once the blaze got going... ...the fireworks. So, fair play and best wishes to us all for a merry Christmas and a happy new year. And a happy new year. What about this mystery man in Montreal I've never heard about? - What happened to him? - He died. Something I've been meaning to tell you about what I'm really doing here. I think I haven't told anybody else. Sounds serious. Yeah, it's pretty serious. Jesus - Let's go. - Where? To the police, like we should've done in the first place. No! No fucking police. Get in the car. I'm not asking you, I am telling you. If you go to the police, I swear to God, - you will never see me again. - Don't you threaten me. Don't you make me. So, what the hell am I going to do? Still a tough question. I can't lose her, I can't lose another one. I just can't. You can, and you will. Sure, every love affair since Adam and Eve has ended the exact the same way. Someone leaves, or someone dies. There's not a goddamn thing you or anyone else can do about that. Maybe what you need to start thinking about... is maybe another woman, another person, another anything, isn't the answer to every little last thing that's wrong with you. Maybe not for you, Dad, but for me, it's all I fucking got. I can't lose her. Well, good fucking luck with that then. Thanks very fucking much, Dad. Oh, Thank God you're here. Morning, lazy bones. Oh. Oh, God, I love you. I love you. I love you, too. It's my daughter. The hell is she doing here? Josée, what are you doing here? Papa, are you okay? Yeah. Oh, it's good to see you. I want you to meet the woman I love. This is Charlotte, Charlotte this is Josée, my favourite daughter. Papa, this isn't funny. But it's not meant to be funny. We love each other. Love who, Papa? There's no one here but us. But she's standing right there. Don't you see her? Look. Papa, you're scaring me. Mm-hm.

And I did. It was a pretty nice high. So, I finished the bottle. Yeah, I know. What a lowlife, eh? Anyway, the ex dropped the dogs off the other day. and the dog pain killers? Well, they're still on the kitchen counter next to the sink right where they're supposed to be. And me? Well, I'm right where I'm supposed to be thanks to my sobriety. and I'm just grateful that I can be here in the right place with you guys. Thanks for letting me share. Thanks, Mike. My name is Samuel, and I'm an alcoholic. Samuel. Thanks for sharing, Mike. I really identified with what you said there about being in the right place. I've, uh... I've just come from my daughter's bedside, and, uh... it seems she was strung out on heroin, and I didn't notice... because I was too busy being a selfish alcoholic asshole. What a lovely surprise for me, your favourite daughter! I was calling you from the restaurant for 45 minutes. You didn't answer. Oh, was that today, our lunch? I'm so sorry. I forgot. I've been so caught up with the new show, and school. It's been so crazy. I'm sorry. Why don't you come with me? No, no, no, no. You run along. - We'll catch up later. - Come on, my love. We can still lunch after. No. Papa, papa, papa. Please, please. Come with me, my love. Come on. Papa, please. Come with me, my love. Come on. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I'll take you home. Come on. Hey! Hey, what the fuck man! You ever go near her again, I'll fucking bury you. Fuck. She still looks the same as the day we brought her home. I can see all the days in her face. Oh, my poor darling. It's my fault. I should have known. I should have noticed. No. Me, too. As soon as she's rested, we're gonna get her the best help. She's gonna be alright. Yeah. I guess I should be going. It's getting late. Yeah. Goodnight, my dear. I am going to slowly beat the living shit out of him until he is completely fucking dead. He's a sick boy, Layton. He does things to hurt people. Like I did things to hurt people that I cared about more than anything in the world. And I am so sorry for that. You weren't that bad. Actually, fuck it, you were a terrible father. Half the time, the other half, you were... You were okay. Thanks. It's more than I deserve. Yeah. I know... and you're welcome. I've made so many mistakes in my life. I've been in the wrong place so many times, I feel that... ...it's just been one long series of mistakes. And that it might have been better for everybody if I... Anyway. What can you say, except... "I'm sorry"? And I'm just thankful to be with you guys today in the right place. Thank you.

Hey, look who it is. Good old Lazarus. How goes the sober resurrection? Taking it one day at a time, as they say. God, what a beautiful day. Spring. Let's take a walk, old friend. Sorry about that Lazarus gag. I wasn't thinking. Don't worry about it. I still don't understand why you didn't tell anyone earlier. Maybe you could have done something, help somehow. I don't understand it myself. Yeah. Moving on to even half of your topics. - The advanced copy. - Oh. Almost done. - I actually like it. - Thanks, I think. The part with the dead dad is very touching stuff. Yeah. Frankenstein, that was quite the surprise. Just, please, whatever you do, don't tell me how it finishes up because I'm on the edge of my seat. Lips are sealed. Seriously, though, man, it's a really great job. You should be very proud. Coming from you old friend, that really means something. Thank you. You're welcome, you lucky bastard. Writing a book that's better than anything I'll ever pull off, return from the wild, clean and sober, back in the saddle. In this little game called life, my friend, you're the fucking big winner! Yes, I know it seems like that, but I'm still dying. Could be gone any time, but fuck that death guy, right? Yeah, fuck that death guy. You know, it's all true, Brendan. The sun is hot, the mountain is high, life is short, very short, but so, so beautiful. And, you know, we haven't really talked since then. I kind of miss him. Have you told him how you feel? No, does that work? Yeah, yeah. I've heard that it... Oh, I've got you. - Okay? - Yeah, this is fun. We got to do this more often. Yeah, we should. the November sun fell on the cold green hill, and the sea rolled on in blue black swells, and the smell of the cigarette being smoked by the ghost of my father crackled in the wind. And a wind was blowing through me as well, blowing cold through my days, cold through the years. And I wondered, "Who am I?" as these avalanches overtake me. The five year old child abandoned by his mother, shaking like a falling leaf? The sixteen year old boy standing over his dying father, frozen like winter morning water? Or this man, grown old, sitting by sea's edge, all alone with his dead dad? And I wondered, "Who am I and who are the ghosts?" Thank you. Samuel, I just wanted to say that was so good. Thank you. And also that, um, I don't know. I'm... I'm glad that you weren't a ghost. Me, too. That you've been here for everyone. Yeah. Alright, off to read my new favourite book. Yeah, careful. Don't let it put you to sleep. I don't think so. Pretty good read there, Professor, though it did seem a little fucking familiar. What's going on, Chad? - My idea. - What? My idea about the guy who sees his dead father that I told you about that morning on the mountain. How you stole my fucking idea! What are you talking... You stole my fucking idea for your fucking book! Oh, sure, you dressed it up with a few little bells and whistles, but it's still my idea, that I fucking told you. It's still my fucking story! You're a fucking thief. You're a fucking thief. You stole my fucking idea. You stole my fucking girlfriend. You stole everything. I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you! Are you alright? Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hey. Nice to see you. I was wondering where you disappeared to. I'm sorry, son, but it's time. What? Jesus Christ. The shifty little fucker shot me. Yeah, yeah, really blew your brains out. Couldn't you have done something? Couldn't you have warned me? Afraid not. It's time to go. But I can't leave now, Dad. Look how they need me. I was just beginning to make it up to them. They'll all be okay, believe me. Somehow, some way, they'll all be alright. - Are you sure, Dad? - Yeah, I'm sure. You were a good man, son. Proud of you. And I love you. - Ah, thanks, Dad. - It's time to go. So... So, this is dying? Yeah, this is dying. Not what I expected. This isn't exactly the end. This is more like we're walking up to the station, about to catch our train. And where are we headed? Home. Home? Will Mum be there? Sorry, son, it doesn't really work like that.
