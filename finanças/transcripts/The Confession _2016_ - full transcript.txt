Where is your husband ? Prisoner in Germany. Since the beginning of the war. Two years that I have more news. He is a communist, like myself. You deprive yourself for others? -More than was in your shoes before. You know what he died? -No. On indigestion. Must do in wartime. Indeed. I have an indiscreet question. You did it. Given the location, it's normal. Indeed. So this question? Would you like trying to make a prayer out of the confessional? A prayer to whom? A prayer to X. Whatever ? You kneel in church, it will make you a little cold knees, and you invent a prayer. In your idea. It does not hurt to stop for a moment and focus on bigger than yourself. -I am not a believer. That would be absurd. Who says that the effort not as valuable as faith? Try it, you'll see. Just once. That is true. Well you handle the verb. We had not lied to me. Who ? My colleagues at the Post. They swear by you. I do not rejoin the herd. I saw what I wanted. -I salute you -Wait. Come to the rectory. I'll lend you a book. Given your beliefs, I know what would interest you.

I did not expect to see you so soon. I thought you would not come at all. You have piqued my curiosity. I wanted to know what book I inspired you. -You like to read? -Verry much. I wanted to be a French teacher before the war. This one will please you. St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke and St. John. Choose. Do not read the four. Why are you laughing ? You've read them? -No need. I hear it every day since my childhood. -You have not wanted to try to play? You read Karl Marx? In part, yes. His style is indigestible. He gave me food for thought. I'll read it. But that will not make me change my mind. What is your opinion? -The religion is a form of cowardice. Here then ? Why ? Men have invented God to ward off their fear of death and nothingness is behind. -You think I'm not afraid to die? Surely less than others. You see me braver than I am. No one can predict his last. I, no more than another. excuse me I'm already late. A militiaman was shot, I must give him absolution. And he died for our discussion? It is that God wants you to. I first there to live.

It will surprise you, but I found it very beautiful. And very sad. Your poor Christ was certainly noteworthy. Although I do not believe in its divine essence. Pity. It would make you less sad. What I find most tragic, is that the word of a humanist be so was so diverted from its meaning to serve the interests of one caste. That of the clergy and manipulators in your genre. I thought also What did you hope? Continue. You said: "manipulator." Absolutely. What turns me into your Christianity that he wants to submit. The faithful must suppress their desires for the sky ? They have to suffer in silence and be content with what they have. It's not false. Only for those who believe tradition. Or worse, by interest. For all others, Heaven is not a reward. It is a simple fulfillment. It's just the lifting of the grain, as our Lord said. Non. Your Lord. It is also up to you. -Not if I refuse. -Refusez the Earth rotates, it changes nothing. Exactly. I feel that you speak of another planet. I understood nothing of the lifting of the grain. Patience. I shall find the words. -To convert me? -To make myself understood. Only the Lord and yourself to convert you. It's between you and him. I have nothing to do with it. bells This is the time of the curfew. He must go. Do not take a risk. -Indeed. See you ? Why I come back? You do not want to convert. I like to share with you. And determined as you are, it is you who make me change my mind! Go quickly. What are you doing here? No lipstick? He did not like it. It's almost curfew. I have a Ausweis. wailing Cheers Caution, do not waste it! I will bring tomorrow. -A larmichette. -Danièle go. And that's not all, attention. Look. Oh, amazing! -I want to feel. -You go it where? I have an uncle in trade. I was not going to say no. How beautiful ! This is an extraordinary jelly. That is true ? Barny, come. What are you doing ? It is the gift of his beloved. -It limit, but we will not throw it. And hungry. Come gather strength. No thanks. Take my hand, if you want. It's real ham. The real ham, look. Alors, Barny.

Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, I put forgiveness. Where there is discord, I put the union. Where there is error, I may bring truth. Where there is sadness, I may bring joy. Where there is darkness, I put your light. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. I went back to see him. Morin father. I know, he told me. He asks you to come? -All the girls will visit him. A hive. He speaks well. I could listen for hours. You know what they think of you? -Of me ? -That you're a funny girl. Really? That's all ? He also said: "It is closer to God than many." Whatever ! What do you think of Morin father? I do not know. He is nice. His insurance exasperates me. I want to destabilize it. I can get there. If it's not him who your skin. We bet ? You really are a funny girl. But you're a good girl. You too darling. I have a confession. Speaking ... I love another woman. And it is reciprocal? Non. She does not suspect anything. This is Sabine. My colleague, you know. -I understand. It's a nice person. I assure you, I will not sleep with her. My love is pure and selfless. Of course. This is normal, all the men of the city are gone. Non. You are a man, you. For me, it's not the same. This is separate. And tell me, is that suddenly, unless you like your husband? -No. So much good you do. With your daughter, you like 3 people at a time. Another effort and it will be on an equal footing. God is love, obviously? You understood everything. I do not see how that proves its existence. Why do you want proof? Otherwise how could I believe? In short, if you are sure of the existence of God, you'd be a believer? Obviously. But God did not exist. It is life. No past, no present, no future. It is defined as in the Old Testament. "I am "The one who is." It's like saying: "X equals X." And after ? After that, nothing. Belief in God, this is not a scientific certainty or brain, as you think. Belief in God, it's just An evidence. I'll do your portrait. This point is you. And there is God. Look. You, the point you want to think and encompass the square. But it's impossible. So much to be contained in the square. Must not switch roles. It looks like a pen, it's a disaster. And like that ? It suits you stubborn? Close your eyes and let your imagination push as far as possible the walls of the cube which you are the center. Go ahead, close your eyes. It's funny as hell. It is endless, is not it? Your 1st prayer. Congratulations. No, Father. You will not have me so easily. These are just words. It's been 2000 years you sharpen your arguments. Normal you have to advance. You are right. We are wrong to talk like that. The words are useless. God is a different revelation for everyone. And incommunicable. Incommunicable ? But it's terrible! And why ? It makes you what, there is a God or not? But it changes everything, of course. It was you who said it. You tire me in the end! See you. The door closes.

From now on, everyone will be right. It is characteristic of victories. Besides the collaborators who will get by. I would have trouble giving my blessing. While there, they are without a priest for a long time. There is no deviation. It's almost new ground. Why leave so soon? That's my life, Barny. You had to finish my conversion. You will see with my successor. You will continue, is not it? Yes surely. To be honest, I do not know. It was under your influence than I thought God is Catholic. -Appelons-Catholic if you want. That does not prevent him from being something else. Our Lord said: "There are many rooms in my Father's house." The important thing is to believe in Him. For the rest, nothing obliges you. Can I help you ? No, everything is there. There are these boxes to climb the attic waiting to know where to send me. Good I am leaving. Thank you for the time you dedicated to me. It is for me to thank you. Why ? Let's for your bad temper. You have no questions for the last night? -J'en would lifetime. I prefer to keep quiet. If I have one. Speaking ...

What I can tell you, is that until now, it is not spent a day in my life without that I think of him. -You do not pursue your conversion? I gave up. Not to destroy my family. And to be honest, I never knew if it was God I loved him through or him I loved through God. It's like saying "X equals X", right? Lord, Barny hosts, Thy beloved child.
