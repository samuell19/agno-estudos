Hey, what do you think is the world record for longest time without sleeping? Take an addy. I just took one. Sucks. Hey, do you think I should tell Dev how I feel? If you want to, yeah. I just-- I don't want to make things weird, like, within the group. But I feel like if I don't say anything before break, then it'll never happen. Okay, then do it. -Has she, like, said anything about me? -No, no. -Is that a good thing, or? -I don't know, man. I don't know. -I mean, should I tell her? Do you think-- -Oh my God, okay. Right. You, you've got to just do it. Okay? Or else, you need to stop talking about it. Because more you talk about it, the more it's gonna drive me fucking crazy, and you never gonna do it, so. Come on, chill out. Fucking idiot. Oh, hey girl. Hey. Hey Dev, how was work? Did you see any dead bodies? Nothing happened. Unremarkable. Isn't that a good thing? Not when I could've been studying. Are we actually gonna pass this test? Yes, yes, of course. You guys know that kid Jasper, in our class? Who sits in, like, the last row. There's a lot of people in that lecture hall. Okay, well I had Chem one with him last semester. He had this crazy study guide with all these diagrams, and patterns, and mnemonics, like, all the stuff to memorize compounds. Sick, right? - Ryan. - Huh? Study guide. Oh, yeah, yeah, Jasper. Um, he's probably got one for this test. Why'd he wanna help us? I think he'll take a trade. For what? - No, no. - No. - No. - Not the ganja! Definitely not. No. Jasper! Jasper! Oh, what's up, Ryan? Where are you going? Uh... How are your finals going? Hanging in there. Are you going to the library? No, I don't really, um, study around people anymore. Oh, okay. You're torching up gas in your room, aren't you? Yeah, I'm totally torching up gas in my room. Yeah. My friends Dev and Maya got an ounce of this crazy Californian strain. I think you'll love it. That sounds cool. Yeah, um... You just gotta hear the story. You wanna hear the story? You want my study guide? I really, really want your study guide, yeah. But, but, but, listen to me, I have an idea. You come back with us, we'll smoke you out, order some tacos, we'll study a little bit. It'll just be the four of us. It'll be super chill. Um... ...okay. -Cool? Let's do it. -Yeah. Yeah, sure. -Alright. -Hey, I'm not paying you guys for the tacos, so. Yeah. Yeah, dude, the last time I smoked this shit, I was, like, fucking-- literally, I was fucking eating baked potato skins, watched an entire season of Victorious, and my mom called me. Wait, there's not gonna be baked potato skins outta this thing, right? -No, no. Don't worry. Yeah, no, you're good. -I'm lactose intolerant. I mean, I don't even really like 'em that much. Yeah, so last time I smoked this shit, I ended up on my fucking roof with my pants off. And like, nobody told me how even I got there. Oh, shit. -Hey. -Oh, shit. You okay? You alright? Let's get you up. Hey, do you live around here? Can I get you home? You're welcome. What's this? What are they? How'd I know? They look custom. There's no label on them. I have no idea. So, if we just, uh, took these with us, he wouldn't fall over and die? Not unless he's running a pharmacy out of his house. Well, let's, um, hold on to them. I can just give it to him. He's right there. But he's so far away. Holy shit. This is tight, dude. Jasper, you fucking legend. What did I say about this guy? Not bad. Can I interest you in one of these? - What is that? - Diet meth. I'm sorry, what? It's what's gonna get us all an "A" on this test. Diet meth is just like the scientific way to say it. No, I'm honestly, uh, done studying today. Okay. Do you have any substance, like, anything that you're-- I think I'll stick with coffee. You guys can, uh, enjoy the meth. How many of those have you had today? I think this is my-- this is like three, three. One of these is worth three of those. Try a half. I think I'm done studying at this point. Then why are you dosing le café? I shit, like, emotionally stressed before test now I think. I wish I could say the same. Ryan mentioned something about weed. The outer-space kush? I really hope that's not what you guys call it. - That's what I call it. - Why? Because-- Okay. I found these master extractors in Northern California who genetically modified strains that could be grown in cold and dark environments. Like, outer space. So, yeah. It's like the best I've ever had. How did you get it? Dev found out how to talk to these dudes online. I just got at using bitcoin. -Oh, cool. How much? -Eight hundred. -Bitcoin? -US dollars. Oh, you said bitcoin. Do you need me to explain to you how the blockchain works? Nope. Well, let me know if you have any questions about the study guides. I know the Venn diagrams get a little tricky. I made them. Thanks, you got it. Wait, what are you gonna do? May go for a walk, may go for a stroll. Um, we could do those, let me know when the tacos get here. That'd be very nice, thank you. He took the kush. What a fucking great guy. He's awesome. Where'd Jasper go? I don't think he ever smokes with other people. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen him smoke. He's like, Schrödinger's cat... ...or something. Dev, I think he's in your room. Why would he be in my room? 'Cause he's like, Schrödinger's cat. You okay, Jasper? Jasper... ...are you okay? Jasper. Are you okay? Yeah. I just need to lie down. What are you doing in my bed? I didn't know this is your bed. And in your outdoor pants. Are you sure you alright? Just feeling... ...empty. Oh. It's probably just the pot. It's not the pot. Okay, um... well, we got so much studying done after your study guide. It's taco time. Let's get you out of my room. Hey, feel like a human again? I do, yeah. The tacos are good, thank you. Um, but I've come to the conclusion that your guys' weed just sucked. Hopefully you can get that Bitcoin back. I don't think our weed is the problem. Are you good bro? I thought you smoked all the time. He wasn't ready for the extraterrestrial realm. No, I wasn't that. I'm just used to, like, a cleaner high. That was not a clean high. Fine, we just won't give you any more then. Problem solved. Oh my God, Ricky! What the fuck? Ugh. Sorry guys. Hold on. Hi, Ricky, comma. We need more shit over here, please, period. We will pay upfront this time even. Comma. Uh, extended release please, thank you. Oh my God. Fucking Ricky ghosting me now. Where the fuck is he? Oh, God. He doesn't even know where he is. Okay, well, that's awesome. Because now we're out of addy, and we have Ricky fallen off the face of the fucking planet as usual. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. I'm not about to let fucking Ricky ruin my night. Yeah, Ryan, that's smart. Let's just, let's just be done studying. Oh no, I don't drink. Christ. Oh, this one's for you. Whoa! Aah! I said I saw you coming out of the bathroom, dude. I know it was you. No. No. Hey, Jaspie, are you, um, are you gonna study with us again tomorrow? - No, I'm honestly, I think I'm done studying. I-- if you wanted to, we could again tomorrow. I got a few wrong. I'm actually kind of tired, so I might just duck out now. - But, thank you for the food, though. Appreciate it. - Right. Yeah, I got a couple wrong too. Yeah, yeah, I got a couple of right. Uh, yeah, I'm, I'm honored, but, uh, I'm getting pretty sleepy, so I'll probably duck out now. -But, thank you. -Or we could have a little slumber party. Ryan, what the fuck is that? Where did you get this? You know the old guy? The eyes and the face. You wanna take that? Oh yeah, yes. I know that guy, the zombie. -Yeah, you know. -The one who is always walking around the town. Hm-hmm. Yeah. Found him fucking face down on the concrete. And these pills were right next to him. You took his shit? I mean, what do you think they are? Mm, I don't know. I mean, these are, like, homemade. Only one way to find out. Mm, no, you have no idea what's in them. That's so dangerous. Or really, really fun. Mm, no. I mean, you guys have seen the old guy, right? He's like, fucking bonker out of his mind. He's probably been doing this shit since the '60s. Yeah and Ryan-- They knew how to do drugs back in the '60s. That you could just, mm, take a pretty little charm off of a stranger's tongue and then you'd just melt into a bed of daisies. Those were the days. -Hmm. -No, no, people do this all the time. They just go into the medicine cabinet, and then take whatever they want, and they call us and they're dead before we even get there. Yeah, but you work as an EMT, you're biased. -Yeah, but that's-- -But... ...if this old frail man is taking this and he's still chugging along, our supple 20-year-old bodies will be just fine. Only you were this convincing when you're sober. Stupid. Who's next? - Me. - Come on. - Seriously? - Thank you. Ah. That's my water. Ooh! I did it. Remember the time at the lake? I had known you for about a week. Everybody says never to trip with strangers but we didn't listen. This is how we get closer. Oh my God, can I have fucking another? This is so fucking boring. - Dev. - Yeah. Yes. Okay, thank you. Yay, Dev. I should get my jacket, so. This black one's got your name all over it. You see? Right there, Jasper. You're curious, Jasper. You're a curious guy. That's why you are a scientist. We both looked into that old guy's eyes. We saw something. He can see shit that none of us can see. He knew something. You fucking take this, we can see that shit. Alright, hear me out. Worst case, it fucking sucks. We're in it together. You said yourself you're done studying. Even the worst trip comes to an end. Oh! - Yeah. - Yes, Jaspie. My fucking boy, Jasper. - Jasper. - -Jaspie, Jaspie, Jaspie, Jaspie, Jaspie, Jaspie, Jaspie. Jaspie, Jaspie, Jaspie. What did I tell you? This fucking guy, Jasper. I love saying your name. Fucking Jasper. Fuck yeah. - Hey. - Hey. -What are you reading? -A case study. What's this one about? They found this guy, right? And he had blood in his stool. So, they thought it was an intestinal infection. But then they went in with a camera, and they found that there was this parasite. And it was eating its way through his organs. And then right before it got to his liver, they caught it. How'd they catch it? They pulled it out through his rectum. - Ooh. Fuck. - I know. Did it, like, make his rectum bigger? Did it, like, widen the hole? -No. No. -No? Lucky guy. - Yeah, yes. - Yeah. Um, actually, I wanna talk to you about something. Yeah, what's up? Um, I think it'll be cool if we, uh, actually hang out more one-on-one. Like, you and me. I think after a break, um, we should go out, like, get dinner. And then, like, go see one of the amazing bands that are in town. Like, I just think... ...that could be a lot of fun. Um... Yeah, I don't know. I just think we could have, like, a really fun night and-- Dude, fuck those fucking pills. Fucking stupid. You are not using gloves? No. Hypochlorite is bad for your skin. Not if you wash your hands soon enough after. Just offering a deduction. Well, thanks for the deduction, Jasper. Shut up, geeks. Hey, Jasper, do you want some cereal? -Hey, you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. Here, try this. What is this? It really helps with, like, a chronic sore throat. I don't wanna take another pill. When I was little, I was diagnosed with what they called a medically skinny throat. I took this pill and I swear to God, it fixed it. -A medi-- A medically skinny throat? -Medically skinny throat. Like I-- Nothing can go down at all. Except for this pill, and then... -For how long? -...I promise. For years. - What the... - Cheers. Ryan. Ryan. This is boring. Have you ever tripped before? No. Well, what do you do for fun? I like to go hiking. Oh, really? Where? Down by the foothills. Oh, my God. I love the foothills. I, like, love nature. I love it so much. You don't really talk that much, do you? That's okay. Are you feeling what I'm feeling right now? 'Cause I like, I feel like... ...all the colors in this room are just like... ...so saturated. I can hear my milk. Yeah. That weird old man meds got us, like... ...blegh. I guess it's not just another boner pill. Wait a sec. You're not having a boner, are you? There's also like, like cough. We keep, we keep coughing. Yeah, yeah, for real. Also, my thoughts are just like, bouncing, like, back and forth, like, like, have you ever thought about how just in an instance, you could ruin your entire life? Like, I could just kick a baby into the street, and then my whole life would be over. Do you ever think about that? No. Yes. Yes or no? Okay, that makes me feel better. How is everybody feeling? Are you the shaman now? Duh. Of course, I've done the most psychedelics here. Um, no, I have. I had to swaddle you like a baby when you were on shrooms. Chillout Ryan. Oh, my God. I didn't expect to see an army of trolls. You better walked by a daycare center. Every line in my hand leads to something. Wow. Where does this one lead? That one goes to space. To an uninhabitable planet. We'd be the first ones, and we have to repopulate it. What about this one? That one feels really good. I have an idea for an experiment. Ryan! Ryan! What's happening? What's happening? Ryan. Ryan? Ryan! Ryan! Are you guys okay in there? It's fine, it's Ryan. Ryan. Ryan! Ryan! Dev-- Holy shit. He had a compromise... I don't know. What are you doing? -I'm giving him another pill. -No. You're gonna kill him! Have you ever tried turning it off and on again? Hurry. I don't know. How do I get this down? How do I-- - Like this, like this, like this. - -Okay, okay. Dev, He's not, he's not breathing. Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! He's still, he's still-- I was gone. What happened? What did it feel like? Like sleep paralysis. I couldn't wake myself up. It's like that shroom trip? No. It's way scarier. It's gonna happen to all of us. Who's next? Me? You took it right after him. We have to keep taking them. No, I'm not taking another one. We have to. Or else we're all gonna... Maya? We took them at 6:40. Comes down every seven hours. You know that pill bottle isn't bottomless. We should call the police, a doctor, an adult. No, they'll think we're taking drugs, they'll jail us, we'll go into the comedown phase in there and then we're dead. -What are we going to do? -We're gonna keep taking the pills to stay alive. We'll take the same color so we avoid mixing effects. Wait a second. Why don't we just try to find the old man? What? No. We could go to lab and actually examine them. But the old man will be able to show us where they came from. -But he's not gonna be up right now. -How do you know? 'Cause it's two in the fucking morning. Okay, well, how are we gonna get into the lab anyways? -I do research for Miller. -So? So, he gave me the keys. Are you sure we can be in here? Oh, yeah. I don't think anyone else is gonna come in here. Are you sure Jasper has clearance? I mean he has keys, so. What if they're not his keys? Dude, you realize that we're in here because of you, right? Where is Ryan? What? Ryan. Oh, um, if he's, uh, shitting his pants, scared... ...check the bathroom. Because... - Dev! - Oh, hey. - Have you seen Ryan? - Um, no. I think he went to the bathroom, like, a while ago. Not sure. I really don't wanna go in there. Yeah, I know. Okay. Okay, I'll do it. - Yep. - I'll do it. Good. Ryan! What the hell are you doing? Getting the shit out of my body. Oh my God. Are you okay? This is so fucked up tonight. With Dev. Wait, what? You saw what was building. I ruined everything. I'm gonna die with so many regrets. Dude, you're not even old enough to have regrets. Ryan, this is serious fucking shit we are in here. Okay? Dev's just doing what she has to do. I'm not like you, Maya. I'm losing my shit. I brought us into this. I'm sorry. It's just not your fault, Ryan. Come on. Stop. Stop. Hey, you guys find the cure? Nope, everything is fucked. Jaspie? Jasp, what did you find? Nothing. What if it's just a more complex compound? I tested for that. What about atomic absorption? You tried that? No, forget elements. There's a molecule in here I've never seen in my life. What do you mean? Each one of the capsules has a same common molecule. I've tested it over and over again. It's an enigma. I'm not even-- You've never seen the molecule before? I'm not even sure if this comes from planet. We've got to find the old man. Alright then, rise and shine campers. Sun's up soon. You know what that means. If you guys give me the weekend I could stay here. Maybe I can make some progress No, we're going for the old man. Okay, you guys go. I can stay here and look into this No. Let's go. I've banged on his door for 20 fucking minutes, like any reasonable person would. And he's ignoring me. What are we gonna do? We're breaking in. How? Oh, fuck. He's got a tough lock. Shit. He saw me. Don't worry. I got this. Hold tight, Hurry. Yeah. - Hurry, come on. - Damn it. Shit. Are you sure he's here? Yes, of course, I'm fucking sure he's here. I mean, that is why I picked the lock. Well, maybe he went off the back. Alright. Yeah, good idea. What are you doing? -No, no, stop it, -Aah! Stop it. Stop! Stop it! Shit's on the water. There's nothing in here. There's nothing in here. Sit him down. ...there's nothing. Where are the rest? Where are they? - What did you do, you fucking-- Stop. - -Um, there's an... - What did you do? - ...there's an element in here - I can't identify. I can't-- - They're dissolved. It's not on the periodic table. Just, can you write it? Please. Please. They're dissolved. How do we stop taking these? What's the solution? How do we stop? What did you do?? Holy shit. You killed him. We should've stayed at the lab. Jasper, can you please stop talking right now? We should've stayed at the lab. Jasper, just shut up. I should've stayed back, I told you guys I should stay back. Jasper, can you please not right now? -Why would you hit him? -I don't know. I don't know why I did it. I'm sorry. Let's just get him out of here. Okay? Let's take his car. Guys, come on. I didn't find any pills. Just found this. What is this? Looks like wingdings. Yeah, it's, it's like a system he created. I'm, I'm gonna figure it out. I've got it. I've got it. Everything good? Yeah, just tired. Okay, I can make coffee then. Thanks. You know you did what you had to do back there, right? Thank you. Guys, what are we gonna do about the body? Hey, doesn't this look like that factory that's in town? Guys, what are we gonna do about the old man? Jasper, shut the fuck up. What are you gonna do to him? I want to see the pill's effects on the body, once they've been in there and had time. If I can learn more about the pill's effects on him, then maybe I can treat our symptoms. And it's the only option at this point, so. What do you mean exactly? We're going to perform a dissection. What? What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. His body will show us exactly what we need to know. You're saying we kill him? No, no, it would be better if he were alive. That way, I can see how his blood vessels dilate. How his lungs are moving. No, that's insane, that's cruel, that's inhumane. You can't cut someone open without their consent. He can't even give consent. You saw him back at the house. He can't talk, - he can't even write. - So is that our logic? Is that our logic? He knew we were coming, he flushed the pills down. He clearly, there's someone in there. I'm not going to kill him. I know there's someone in there. Dude, he was trying to kill us. How? By flushing the pills. Yeah, or he was trying to save us. He doesn't give a fuck about us. Stop. It doesn't matter now. - Maya, Maya. Take a breath, okay? Whatever's going on in there, it isn't really happening. We answer this door, we're chill. Got it? Whoever it is. Okay. Ricky, what the fuck? Hey, yo. My bad, guys. My car crashed in the creek and I had to walk back. - Are you fucking serious? Oh, come on! But I have your addy. Okay, I don't give a fuck about the addy. Ricky, get the fuck out. That's what she said. Wait, wait, wait, wait Do you have any oxys? Okay, I've got this terrible headache. Geez, you guys are demanding. Holy shit. -Okay, okay, okay. -Okay, hurry! Oh, my God. But, I have a really-- It's a migraine. Alright. Hold up. Hurry. Is that hydros? Yeah, hydros. How do you know? Thank you. Ricky, Ricky, get the fuck out of here, go. -Get the fuck out, go. -Are you guys okay? I need you to get really fucking far away. So, uh, cash or credit? Tips are appreciated! But I'm also looking into a crypto option. - Bye. - -Hey, yo, what's, what's Maya's deal? -Who was it? -Ricky, idiot. Had any oxys? Yeah, he had hydros. Nice. Okay. Just like this. It starts in the lungs. There is an excessive fluid in his lungs. It's restricting his oxygen. - Oh, shit. - What? - It's the comedown. - Get him a pill. - I didn't know. - It's not your fault. - I didn't... - -You literally didn't know. Hey, guys! It's almost time for next dose. Uh, okay, ju-- Uh, just leave them by the door. Is Dev okay? Dude, not now. Alright. Hey, man. Hey. Going to the lab? No. Hey, you got like a melatonin or something? I can't sleep. No, I do not. Alright, thanks. Ryan! How are you feeling, Ryan? Like shit. I can't sleep on these. Damn. Where's Jasper? He left. When? Like 4:00. When? Where'd he go? Guys. Jasper left his pills. What the fuck! I think I know where maybe he could be. Okay, where? The foothills. When is the next dose? 5:40. Dev, you could just pull up right here. Jaspie! Ah! Fucking shit. Jasper, just fuckin stop it. It's not funny. It's not funny. Are you kidding me? Can you hear me? Jasper! Jasper! Jasper! Jaspie! - Jasper! Jasper! - Jasper! Jasper! Jasper! Jasper! Jasper! -Jasper! Jasper! -Jasper! Jasper! Jasper! Hey, I missed my dose. The comedown's delayed. Delayed? You had no symptoms? No. The air. It's good up here. There must be something in the air in town that reacts poorly with the pills. If we get far enough from the town, where the parts per million are lower, then maybe we can... Maybe we can what? The old man must've compounded those pills years ago, before the town was polluted by the factory. He's been dealing with the adverse effects ever since. Last dose. Here we go. Will you guys forgive me if I die? It's working. They're not from this planet. What? Jasper was right. An interstellar rock found in the desert. Odd properties, 1968. Huh. Holy shit. Holy shit! Holy shit!
