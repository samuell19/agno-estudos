Original subtitles by Sud_Arun Colored and Improved by zer0_ OFFICER: Go, go, go. (TIRES SCREECHING) (SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE) (PANTING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Suspect on foot, entering warehouse. In pursuit. Go. (PANTING) Freeze! Stop right there! Put down the weapon! You can't stop it now. On the ground! Nothing can stop it. On the ground. Drop it, right now! Halloran. Detective Halloran. If he's not here in 17 minutes, five people are going to die. Get Halloran here, now! (ENGINE STOPS) (POLICE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) EDGAR: Where the fuck is Halloran? People are gonna die, man! Doesn't he know? All of you, get back. Edgar! Halloran! Edgar, what the fuck are you doing? I can't. You put down that remote. The games are just getting started. HALLORAN: What's that for? His games, his rules. What game? I gotta choose who dies. Them or me. Edgar, I don't want to shoot you, but I will. Drop the remote. No, no, no. I got him, should I take it? Target the remote. If he moves to trigger it, blow it to shit. Running out of time! Edgar! Who else is there? Tell us what's going on! HALLORAN: Who's controlling you? I'm not fucking dying. (ALARM SOUNDS) (BEEPING) (POLICE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (GURGLES) Which one of you assholes shot him in the chest? EDWARD: The game. It's started... (BUZZER BLARES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (PANTING) (LABORED BREATHING) (PANICKED BREATHING) (LIGHT PANELS BUZZING) ANNA: What is this? (WOMAN GROANS) What the fuck? (GROANS) What the hell? Yo, what the hell? RYAN: Oh, god. ANNA: Oh, shit. CARLY: What's going on? RYAN: No, no, no... MITCH: This can't be happening! CARLY: Someone, help me! No, no, no... CARLY: Somebody please help me. Help! Please, help me! Help! Help! Please, help me! Just stay the fuck back! JIGSAW: (OVER PA) I'm sure you are all wondering why you're here. You deny culpability, no doubt, for the circumstances in which you find yourselves. Salvation can be yours, if you cleanse yourselves of the habitual lies which have brought you here. Lies that you have told yourselves, lies that have brutalized others. Confess. The truth will set you free. But any attempt to violate my rules will kill you. I want to play a game. Fuck you! JIGSAW: First, an offering of blood, (CARLY SCREAMING) no matter how little, will give you a green light to escape from this room with your lives. If you can release yourself from your demons, you can begin to shed the chains that those demons bring with them. Make the simple blood sacrifice that I've requested, or face severe consequences. The choice is yours. RYAN: The fuck is going on over here? MITCH: No, no, no! ANNA: No, no, no... No! (SCREAMING) (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL SCREAMING) (SCREAMNG) No! No! (GRUNTS) What do we do? What do we do? CARLY: Someone do something! (GROANING) Hey! Wake up! Wake up! "An offering of blood..." (GROANS) "No matter how little..." "An offering of blood..." "An offering of blood..." (PANTS) "An offering of blood..." (PANTING) (GROANS) (GASPS) (TRAP POWERING DOWN) Cut yourself! You need to cut yourself! He wants blood and then you're free! Cut yourself, he wants blood! Cut yourself! (GASPS) (GROANS) Fuck! Come on, come on, come on. (SCREAMS) (EXHALES) Yes! Holy shit... You need to cut yourself! You need to cut yourself! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) What the... No... (GRUNTING) ANNA: Cut yourself! You need to cut yourself! Cut yourself! (YELLS) (SCREAMS) (SOBBING) MITCH: Where the fuck are we? He hit the remote, but nothing triggered. As far as we know. KEITH: You think the game's real? HALLORAN: Don't know. KEITH: And why do you think he asked for you? We're good friends. I put him away twice. Edgar Munsen is a sociopathic meth head. Been in and out of prison for assault and battery, armed robbery, drug dealing. Nice guy. Doc, we need him awake. We've got questions. Sorry, Detective. The bullet's lodged against the heart. I've got him in a barbiturate-induced coma until he stabilizes. Swelling has to come down first. How long? Two hours. Two weeks. I can't tell you. Excuse me. HALLORAN: Start the suspect list with Munsen's known associates. This is not gonna end well. Hungry? (GRUNTS) CARLY: Help! (CRYING) Please, somebody help us! Help! Please! Don't... Stay still. What do you want with us? ANNA: That voice... It said salvation can be ours if we, cleanse our soul of our lies. This is some kind of fucked up confessional? The truth will set us free. Honey, my soul is clean. It's Anna. And, bullshit. I'm Mitch. What's your name? Carly. (GROANS) Don't touch me. This is some bastard's sick idea of a joke? He said it was a game. Well, then I hope, for all of our sakes, that it is a game. Oh, yeah? Why's that, sweetheart? Because games can be won. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) WOMAN: This is cray. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) BOY: What the hell? MAN 2: Yeah. MAN 1: Did anyone phone the police? (SCREAMS) Underhand! Overhand! Whoa! (SIREN CHIRPING) Okay, you got some heat on it! Cell phone's off for a reason, Halloran. Well, what do you think, El? (SIGHS) I don't know, he looks a little pale. Let's get this thing off. LOGAN: Ah. ELEANOR: Ooh Hmm. Hmm. (HELMET RATTLES) Someone's been studying up on John Kramer. A copycat? Hope not. Kramer's been dead for 10 years. What's up, Doc? Keith! I'm good. Hey, man, how you doing? You too, man. Good to see you. You're, uh... You're working this neighborhood now? Uh, yeah, I joined homicide last month. Jesus, what happened to this guy? You two know each other? Oh. Logan was our medic in Fallujah. Hey, uh, I'm sorry to hear about Christine. How you been, man? Uh, good, Keith. Yeah, I'm doing well. All right. Eleanor. KEITH: What is it? Okay, then. LOGAN: "And then there were four..." You got a computer we could stick that in? JIGSAW: (ON LAPTOP) The games have begun again. And they will not stop until the sins against the innocent are atoned for. I will take care of the next four, you take care of the rest. We gotta get that to voice rec. It's not him. It can't be. Right? (ALL GAPSING) Oh, shit. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (TRICYCLE SQUEAKING) What the fuck? What the fuck? No, that's not creepy at all. (CACKLING) No. No! No, no, no... Help! ANNA: Somebody please help us! Where is this sick fuck taking us? Did anyone see anything? No, nothing. I got fucking drugged! He said, "Confess." We have to confess. Yeah, you got something you want to confess? Have at it. Come on! (SCREAMING) Damn it, we all have something to confess. I sold a kid a bike once. He had an accident 10 minutes after I sold it to him. It's not my fault he couldn't handle such a powerful damn bike, all right? That's it? He died! That's all you did? You sold a kid a bike he died on? That's it! I said that's it, man! Come on, man! Yeah, bullshit. And what about you, sweetheart? Come on. We lost our baby. Anna... Anna. Tell me that this isn't happening. My husband made a mistake. RYAN: No, no, no. That's not a confession, come on. Come on! I don't know what the fuck you want me to say, okay? Come on! No, no. (STAMMERS) I let our marriage fall apart. A confession is, "I killed a hooker in Tulsa," or, "I ate my fucking neighbor." Not, "I need marriage counseling." CARLY: No. RYAN: Carly? Yeah, well, think faster! Nothing I can think of. CARLY: You think faster! (BUZZER SOUNDS) (ALL SCREAM) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) Oh, my God. We're going to hang. Play the damn tape, Mitch. Oh, God! (PANTING) JIGSAW: (ON RECORDER) While I am certain that there is a desire to point fingers at me for the blood that has been shed, unless you turn that finger inward, I assure you, more blood will be lost and all will be judged. We will begin with one. One who is not only a liar, Hey! but a thief. A purse-snatcher. And when you had a chance to fix the harm that you'd done, you chose to do nothing. Now it is you who could die without the right medication. While unconscious, this deceiver among you, this criminal, was injected with a poison. One of the syringes in front of you holds the antidote. One is a saline solution, the other, an acid that will cause an excruciating death. Inject the correct one and your chains will be released. Failure to make the right choice could result in death for you all. I ask you, what is a life worth to you? One of you 'fess up, or we all die. RYAN: Huh? Okay, check yourself for marks. ANNA: If he injected us, there could be marks. Bingo. It's okay, it's okay. What are you doing? You just got to pick a needle, blondie. Look, we get out of these things when you pick an antidote. Or else we all die, Carly! No, no. What if it's the acid? Bullshit, you won't. I won't. Maybe just confess, Carly. Okay, did you steal purses? Yeah, years ago, but I didn't kill anyone! No, no, no! No, that's not the repentant attitude this guy's looking for, okay? You're lying. You're lying! No! I was broke, okay? And yes, somebody died, but it wasn't my fault. Okay. No! Choose, or I'm gonna stick them all into you! Are you kidding me? Stop! Yo, man! Just let her look! Do any of these numbers mean anything to you? I'm trying! RYAN: Choose now! $3.55. What? What does that mean? What a life is worth to me. ANNA: What? RYAN: Oh, fuck... Choose, right now! Come on, pick! I can't do it. Pick one! Pick now! Please! MITCH: We're all going to die! RYAN: Pick one now! MITCH: Come on. RYAN: Pick now! Come on, pick one, Carly! Choose! I'm not gonna fucking do it! No, I'm not going to! RYAN: Pick one, now! Fuck you! I won't do it. Come on, pick! Pick! Fuck! I'm not gonna pick! Now! Now, Carly, now! Pick now! (SCREAMING) Pick one! Pick one! (ALL CHOKING) (ALL GASPING) (ALL COUGHING) (GASPS) (GAGGING) (SCREAMING) (CRYING) Hey! Hey! Fucking asshole! I'm not the one who put us here. Get a hold of yourself. I just saved our lives. Yeah, but you took hers! You killed her. No, stop! You selfish son of a bitch. Both of y'all need to chill! What the hell? A life is worth $3.55. That's what she said. What? Yeah. (WHISPERS) Yeah. $3.55. There's more numbers on the inside of this. It could be the combination. Dental IDs Buckethead as Malcolm Neale. Malcolm Neale? I remember that case. His wife was murdered five years ago. A home invasion. Perp slit her throat. Oh, yeah, yeah. They made him watch. I remember. Malcolm Neale was a, uh, degenerate gambler. Wife's murder was on him. He owed some bad guys some money. And did you ever get around to convicting those bad guys? ELEANOR: Scratch marks from fingernails. There was a struggle, presumably with the killer. The partial decapitation was made by a circular saw. There are traces of ferric oxide, hematite, in the wound. Okay. Rust, from blades. What about the voice recording? Anything off the flash drive? The voice was John Kramer. Matched. Matched? Identical. What, he came back from the dead? Wouldn't be his first time. Just because someone is dead doesn't mean they can't have a voice. Give us enough time, we speak for the dead. On the roof, Edgar Munsen was spouting off about starting a game. The recording says there are four more potential victims. Four people fighting for their lives. (GASPS) God... (STRAINING) Okay, we're in the countryside somewhere. I can't make out any landmarks, nothing. Oh, God. Who's doing this to us? I have no idea. What's your name? Ryan. And what's your sin, Ryan? Sold bad mortgages, sold good coke, cheated on my taxes, cheated on my wife. Both of them. So, you know... Nothing that bad. What's your story, lollipop? It was my husband's fault. Oh, come on. Bullshit. Why... Why am I being punished for something that he did? Huh? If he hadn't fallen asleep, he wouldn't have rolled over and suffocated our baby. (BABY GROANS) It's not my fault. No, no. No! For real, you don't think he's trying to tell us something? Look, there are two perfectly good doors right here. Right, so we'll go through the door that leads exactly he wants us to go? No, Mitch is right. No, thanks. Back the fuck up. I don't think this is... Man, get that shit out of my face. (GROANS) (BUZZER SOUNDS) (GASPING) (RYAN SCREAMS) Oh, my God! Help me! Help. Please. Ah! What the fuck? There's wires, there's something... (RYAN STAMMERING) (WHIMPERING) Help, help. (RYAN GROANS) Anna? Do you see? ANNA: There's 100 wires wrapped around his leg, and around some pulleys. Okay, there's, uh... There's some kind of handle. Guys, there's a tape. (TRAP POWERING UP) (SCREAMING) It's tighter! It just got tighter! Okay... Oh, God! (RYAN SCREAMS) God! Oh! Okay, how do we get the tape? (WHIMPERING) Yeah, careful. Hey, go slow. RYAN: Okay, okay. ANNA: Really slow. Careful. Careful. RYAN: Please, be careful. Oh, God. (GROANING) Careful, careful, careful. (SCREAMING) Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, my God! You guys aren't helping! Grab the tape! Grab the tape! No way, man. No, you gotta fucking grab the tape. I saved your fucking life, Mitch! Grab the tape! RYAN: Please. Just do it! RYAN: Please, yeah. Yeah, come on. Come on. Come on, man. Oh, my God. You almost got it? You got it, you got it. I'm trying, dude. RYAN: All good, all good. You got it? Oh, God, oh, good. You got it? (SOBBING) Play the tape, Mitch. Play the tape. Here, you play the tape, man. (WHINES) JIGSAW: (ON RECORDER) There are no shortcuts in life. Please forgive the rather crude example I will make of your decision to not follow the rules. Pull the handle and you will be set free. What does he mean "set free"? Good luck, lollipop. (SOBBING) Oh, God. Hey, prelim report on Buckethead. It says the particles found on the body are animal feces. Cow, chicken, pig. They also found traces of Aujeszky's disease. It's a virus. Aujeszky's disease? Mostly known because, when swine get it, farmers have to wipe out the entire sounder. I'm impressed. (DOOR OPENS) Keep digging. Dr. Nelson? Maybe I can track the virus to a location. Another one, possible jumper. (SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) Any identification on the victim? No. Looks like the same killer. This was on the body. No link so far to any of our suspects. Is it Kramer? Do you know? Is this crime related to Jigsaw? Think it's any coincidence that Edgar Munsen happens to be a guest here? I think it's highly unlikely he woke up from a coma, climbed on a roof, and threw a girl off. But I did check with the ICU. He's still there. Looks like acid. There's a depletion of adenosinetriphosphate in the muscles fibers. Rigor mortis. Clearly, she didn't die from the fall. It's hydrofluoric acid. Look, here. This is the injection point. The vein carried it all the way to the heart, where it's singed. How do you know it was hydrofluoric acid? Saw a lot of it in Fallujah. Never injected, though. A puzzle piece. Jig-fucking-saw! What's Logan's deal? What happened in Fallujah? Uh, he, uh... Oh. He got captured. Um, but not before taking out three Taliban. Uh, what I heard, they tortured the shit out of him. He spent months in the VA hospital when he got back. You think he snapped? Come on, man, you're talking about a brother, here. I got a brother. He's a fucking asshole. What do you think about his second, Eleanor? She's got a great ass, big mouth. Yeah. Seems to get off on this sick shit. RYAN: Motherfucker! (SOBBING) (PANTING) (STRAINING) What the fuck? Shit. Oh, fuck. RYAN: I'm a good person. I'm a good person, I don't deserve this. I confess... I confess. I con... I confess that this is fucked up! (RYAN CRYING) (RYAN SOBBING) (MECHANISM CREAKING) What? Hey, guys. Hey, guys! Somebody turned on the TV. Hello? MITCH: Yeah, we got one, too. What? I'm going to have to lift you. We gotta get the remote. Okay, fine. MITCH: Got it? ANNA: Got it! (MECHANISM CREAKING) No! No! No! In the past, you have all put your own interests above others, and then lied to yourselves, and deceived the world about your callousness, your larceny, your criminality. Now, you will look in the mirror and you will face who you really are. The choices you have made may cost you your life. You cannot escape the truth. There is, however, one person who can help you. Ryan. If he pulls the lever before you are buried alive, you will live. Ryan, free yourself to free them. Ryan. MITCH: Ryan? (BOTH PANTING) (MECHANISM WHIRRING) (BOTH PANTING) ANNA: No! No! What is that? MITCH: (ON SPEAKER) It's grain! Ryan, man, we're going to get buried alive. ANNA: Ryan! Ryan! ANNA: Ryan! Ryan! Get to the handle! I can't! MITCH: Please, Ryan! Ryan! Hurry, man! Ryan! ANNA: You have to do it! (ANNA SCREAMS) ANNA: Get to the handle! Please! MITCH: Ryan, pull the fucking handle! What's your story, sweetheart? What are you asking, Detective? You one of those, uh, kinky types? Why? Like a little pain? You want to get punished? (LAUGHS) Too late. Already got an ex-wife that tortures me every day. Probably. Maybe you deserve it. Where were you the night Malcolm Neale got murdered? Home. Cool. Alone. Oh. Can you prove that? Do I need to? I will. MELISSA: (ON COMPUTER) Come home soon, Daddy. I'm sorry you have to stay so late again, Judy. Don't worry about it. All right, sleep sweet, Mel. I love you. Love you, bye. Love you too, Daddy. Bye. Logan. How did you find Eleanor? My assistant? Is that all she is? It's been two years since Christine passed. It's just... Yes, but I'm a professional. I wouldn't blame you. Uh, Logan, you ever heard of a website called "Jigsaw Rules"? HALLORAN: Buried deep online. No. Took some digging, but it's a site devoted to Jigsaw. Half of it's bullshit, posers, but there's some stuff on there (CHUCKLES) that is really messed up. Okay? A lot of sick fucks. We did a darknet IP trawl. Got a lot of hits from your assistant. She's a regular. Downloaded some shit you cannot imagine. So you're saying that Eleanor Bonneville is our copycat? No, that's not what we're saying. Did you check her alibi? Uh, she said she was home the morning that Buckethead was found hanging in the park. At 7:00 a.m.? Home alone? A single woman? All right, let's rewind. That does sound suspicious. How did Eleanor come to you? She sought out the department to do her residency. And after that? After she finished her residency? (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) I mean, three months ago, she was offered a job running the show at the Cleveland city morgue. Why didn't she take that? Would you want to move to Cleveland? That's the lab. Results are in. Okay, so this is the DNA of the blood scraped from under the fingernails of the first victim, Malcolm Neale. KEITH: Yeah, Buckethead. Can you ID it? Already did. This is a blood sample from a perp taken a decade ago. You might remember the case. It's an exact match. Whose blood is it? What? John Kramer. That's impossible. That's a fact. The blood under the fingernails of our first victim is John Kramer's blood. The Jigsaw Killer. Ryan! MITCH: Help! ANNA: Help! MITCH: Ryan! MITCH: Pull the lever! Ryan! Uh... ANNA: Get to the handle! Uh... Ryan! MITCH: Help, now! (ANNA SCREAMS) (GROANING) ANNA: Ryan! (ANNA SCREAMS) (WHIMPERS) (SCREAMS) No! Go to hell! MITCH: You gotta help us out, man! (BOTH PANTING) Help! (BOTH SCREAMING) Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Ryan! ANNA: Ryan! MITCH: Pull the handle, Ryan! Pull it! (PANTING) (SCREAMS IN PAIN) Ryan! Ryan! We're gonna die in here! Please! For the love of God, just pull it! If we die, you die! (SCREAMS) God... Turn it off. Oh, God... Ah! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (BLADES WHIRRING) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS IN AGONY) (MITCH COUGHING) (GASPS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) Here's the GPS location on Ms. Bonneville's cell. (SIGHS) Great. Is Jigsaw dead? Did Kramer die, or do we have proof? What do you have to say to all the panicked citizens who want answers? (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Turned your phone off? (SIGHS) And yet here you are, you found me. You'd make a good detective. Or maybe I'm just too predictable. Predictable? No. Halloran's passing the blame around. He's looking at us. Yeah. They're watching my house. Because he thinks your alibi is shit. (SIGHS) You really love that guy, huh? First year at County, clean case, a predator by the name of Alistair Schultz. Halloran roughed him up while he was in custody and the lawyer used that to get him off. The very next day, he kills an 8-year-old girl who shows up on my table. The first of many. Halloran can't help himself, can't get out of his own way. So, no, I don't have much love for the guy. Well, it's a job, Logan. You can't make it personal. When you have a little girl one day... (SCOFFS) Why didn't you tell me about the job offer in Cleveland? Yes. Because you would have told me to take it. It's complicated. Yes, you're damn right I would. We are past complicated. (SIGHS) When Buckethead was strung up, I wasn't at home like I told the cops. I was at my, uh... What studio? Studio. Like I said, And why couldn't you tell them that? it's... It's complicated. You don't think they're going to find out about it? They know about the Jigsaw fan website, whatever the fuck you're doing on that. They're going to find out about everything. El, they think I'm involved. Show me. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Okay, I should warn you, because... Oh, Jesus! Can you turn the lights on? (DEVICE BEEPING) (DEVICE BEEPING RAPIDLY) Eleanor, what is this? Hey, a girl's gotta have a hobby. A hobby? Is that what you call it? How about a stamp collection? (SCOFFS) That's a hobby. (SIGHS) (TRAP POWERING UP) It's beautiful, isn't it? Supposedly, John Kramer designed this trap for a game that took place before all the others. They found the plans in his lab. I built it myself. Got them from some guy on the Internet. Rumor is, not only did John design this, he built one. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint, but none of Kramer's victims died in any device like this. The wounds don't match the design. Well, maybe the bodies were never found. And maybe it never happened. Maybe someone's playing games with you. What are you doing with all this stuff? You need to get rid of it, now. (HEART MONITOR BEEPING) (GASPS) (RYAN SCREAMING) (GROANING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) HALLORAN: Great work. Now we've got probable cause. What? You're not going to believe this. The Commissioner wants to see Jigsaw's remains. Wants proof he's really dead. Yeah. What? Are you serious? Said he wants to calm the peoples' fears. Chasing a dead man. This is election year bullshit. That is all yours. I'm going to follow up on these. Right on. Halloran. He's in a fucking coma, how does he just disappear? He's still breathing. (MITCH BREATHING NERVOUSLY) (PANTING) What is it? MITCH: It says my name. You know what happens if we don't follow the rules. JIGSAW: (ON RECORDER) Hello, Mitch. You've admitted to selling a boy a motorcycle. But you have not told the entire story, have you? $600 for a bike that you listed in excellent condition. Even though you knew the brakes were faulty. You took his 600 bucks and, in return, you delivered him to his end. He was my nephew, and he never hurt anyone. The device you see here has a unique power source. It's the same engine that graced the bike you sold my nephew. However, I assure you, MITCH: Fuck. the brake lever for this one works perfectly. Look, you're right, man! ANNA: Oh shit. Avoid the dangers around you, hit the motorcycle brake handle and the motor will stop. JIGSAW: Live or die, Mitch. Oh, shit. The choice is yours. (BIKE ENGINE STARTS) (MECHANISM WHIRRING) Shit! No, no, no! Oh, shit. Look, I'm sorry! Stop, please! I'm sorry about your nephew! Anna, help! Get the fuck up here! I don't want to die! Stop! Stop it! Stop! (GROANS) (SCREAMS) Anna, you got to help me! Hurry up! Hurry, please! Please help! Hurry! Hurry! (GRUNTS) (CRIES) I don't want to die! I don't want to die! ANNA: Mitch, pull the brake! Pull the brake! ANNA: Oh... Oh, God. (SCREAMING) Anna, you did it! You saved me! (PANTING) Anna... Anna, get me out of here, please. You did it! Man, you did it! No, no, no! (SCREAMING) (TRAP POWERING DOWN) (PANTING) (SCREAMING) HALLORAN: Edgar Munsen was in a coma. You got one job! (CELL PHONE RINGING) One job to do, you useless mother... Yeah. HALLORAN: (ON PHONE) Nothing. KEITH: Anything? Pulled a Houdini. Nobody saw shit. Just pulling Kramer's casket out now. HALLORAN: Reporters? KEITH: Yup. Good. End this nonsense once and for all. John Kramer is dead and has been for 10 years. Enough of this John Kramer bullshit. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) KEITH: Uh... You may want to rethink that. Why? What's going on? Let's just say you can call off the hunt for Edgar Munsen. Oh, come on! Okay, get a warrant for Bonneville, I'll see you there. OFFICER 1: Go, go, go. Move, move, move. Go! OFFICER 2: Let's go. OFFICER 1: Take the left, two on the right. (POLICE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) OFFICER 1: Go, go, go, go, go! OFFICER 3: Clear! OFFICER OFFICER 2: Clear on the left! OFFICER 1: Eyes up. OFFICER OFFICER 2: Watch your left. You in? (OFFICERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) HALLORAN: (BREATHING HEAVILY) Jesus! (GASPS) Two left. So, what, Bonneville just leaves a body hanging in her studio? Come on, man. I know. (SIGHS) I'm gonna go pick up Logan. I'll get the girl. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) I'm gonna need you to show me those wrists, brother. Look, listen, listen. I didn't do anything, Keith. I have photos of you. Yeah, you and Eleanor in your warehouse of torture devices. Yeah, I was there. Wait, you were there? I just saw a third body that looks like it's been through a meat grinder. All right. Someone is trying to frame us. All right? The studio I can explain. I want you to tell me where Eleanor is. Do you know where she is or not? You just have to trust... Keith, I'll tell you everything I know. I know who did this. And you do, too. Who found the body at Eleanor's studio? Jesus! (GASPS) He had motive. Halloran. He wanted Edgar dead. Who ordered the targeting If he moves to trigger it, blow it to shit. of the remote? Go on. Yeah, everybody targeted the trigger, but did anyone actually see what Halloran was aiming at? He had no plan to let Edgar walk. Do you think your partner knows that you're with IA? (SIGHS) So, I'm right. Jesus. You know, I've been onto Halloran since before all of this started. IA has him connected to multiple homicides going back years. Now these latest Jigsaw murders... The three bodies we brought you, we found they're all mixed up in Halloran's cases. Bring him in. Halloran is trying to frame me. (SCOFFS) Really? I don't even know what he's got against me. You know you called him out for screwing up slam-dunk cases. You said he was a moron in the press. Twice. No, I said he was an impulsive asshole... Twice. You blame him for what happened to Christine, don't you? Look, I don't know how to prove Halloran's the copycat. It's Halloran. It's him. Let me help you build your case. Let me get you proof. Let me open up Edgar Munsen. We match that slug to Halloran's gun. (GROANS) What kind of firearm do you use? Glock 22. Most cops do. Except Halloran. He's got a 17. 9x19 Parabellum. That's a Glock 17. (SIGHS) Okay. I'll take you home. You stay there until I call you. I'll get Halloran. El, where the hell are you? Call me, it's urgent. (GASPS) Jesus! El! I've been trying to call you. No, no, no. It's okay. I don't know how that body got... They don't think it's you or me. They have their sights set on Halloran. I found it. I think I know where the game is being played. I found the farm. No! That's great, let's call a detective. Halloran's behind this. We can't trust the cops. What? You want to see this game for yourself. You get off on this shit? Logan, this is a chance for us to save lives. So, we're going take on a serial killer with what? Our cunning intellects? And this. RYAN: Anna! Don't leave me! Anna? (ANNA STRUGGLING) Anna, I'm bleeding out, Anna. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Motherfucker! (GRUNTS) RYAN: Anna! Okay... Anna! Don't leave me, please! (SCREAMS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (PANTING) (GASPS) (GRUNTS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (ANNA SOBBING) Hello, Anna. John? John Kramer? What's going on? You're about to play a game. Oh, no. No. What are you doing, John? What are you doing? It's a final test. I already passed your test! Look at my fucking leg! That wasn't your test, Ryan. And that wouldn't have been necessary if you'd simply played by the rules. But you don't like rules, do you? (WHINES) (SOBBING) You want me to show mercy? You, who hasn't taken even a single step toward confessing. You, who is responsible not for one death, but for three? Your life of reckless deceit started in high school. And only grew worse. Sit down! Sit the fuck down! Get the fuck off me! (BOTH SHOUTING) JOHN: You lied to the authorities multiple times, Ryan, pinning the blame solely on the driver, your deceased best friend. Do you know what you did to his family? Hmm? And you've only gotten worse over the years. I did it. Okay, I fucking did it. I did it, but it was so long ago. I want to live. I want to live. As do I, Ryan. As do we all. But things happen. Were it not for a careless mistake by a resident at the hospital I was in, my cancer could have been diagnosed a lot sooner. It was simply the wrong name on an X-ray. Would've saved me a whole lot of hardship. And you, Anna? I didn't do anything, John. You know me. Please don't do this to me. We were neighbors, Anna and I. My first chemo sessions were very difficult, to say the least. Anna and her husband, Matthew, were so kind, so supportive. I thank you for that. Why are you doing this to me? JOHN: Those were better days for you, weren't they, Anna? But your poor husband, Matthew... I know the two of you didn't always get along. But to have to endure that tragedy, the death of a child, that's, uh... One of life's greatest burdens, isn't it? If only he hadn't fallen asleep that night, then he wouldn't have rolled over and, uh, suffocated your baby. That is what happened, right, Anna? (CRYING) Shut up! ANNA: Shut up! Shut up. Shut up! (BABY SCREECHING) (BREATHING SHAKILY) I mean, it's horrible. How horrible, to have to live with such a thing. (WHIMPERS) It could make a person go mad, couldn't it? What are you going to do to us? (CHUCKLES) Me? I'm not going to do anything. You have to simply assume responsibility. For who you are. ELEANOR: This is it. LOGAN: How do you know this is it? ELEANOR: Tuck's Pig Farm. It was shut down due to an outbreak of Aujeszky's disease. Buckethead's sample. The pig virus. This farm was in Jill Tuck's family. Jigsaw's wife. Still is. Although the place was shuttered years ago. LOGAN: Well, it looks like somebody's here. You sure you want to do this? (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Halloran, it's Hunt. Call me back. (POLICE RADIO BEEPS) We're at Halloran's house, but he's not here. Searching. You got a location on him? Sir? Okay, we need to bring him in. Now! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (RATTLING) ELEANOR: Check this out. That's a lot of blood. What's to bet this is where Buckethead was decapitated. Jigsaw is dead. It's Jigsaw. Is he? (CLANGING) (GASPS) Please... I'll do anything you want, John, just please let me go. Please. Did you know that pigs are highly compassionate animals? They show distress if they see any other animal, including humans, suffering. ANNA: What about you, John? Where is your compassion? We all have a thumb on the scale, Anna. For good or for evil. You've been weighing in on the wrong side of the scale. Both of you. Now, if you want to achieve your freedom, you have to learn. You have to realize that you've been doing it backwards. So... I'm gonna give you an opportunity to turn it all around. (GUN COCKING) Here's your key to freedom. (PANTING) It's all up to you. Now, the game's simple. The best ones are. You have one shotgun. You have one shell. Like I said, it's up to you. How can you say Jigsaw isn't dead? He's dead. Autopsy was performed on his body and he has his own grave. He's not. Jigsaw lives forever through the work of his followers. You. You've been obsessed with John Kramer from the start. The website. The traps you built. Lots of people are fascinated by Kramer. You know damn well I didn't kill Buckethead. Or the other two. Halloran. Then who did? You said it yourself. The bullet matches. He's connected to all the victims. He's right behind you. Drop it. Drop it! Both of you. It's him. Now! Go on. It's him! Come on. Don't. Don't. All right! Come on! All right. Don't. All right, I'm putting it down. Now it's your turn, sweetheart. Come on, sweetheart. Come on. ELEANOR: No... Put it down. HALLORAN: I'll blow his fucking brains out. Yeah. El. That's a good girl. All right. You got what you... Run! (GASPS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (GROANS) He wants us to shoot each other. He wants me to kill you. No. No. No, don't! No, don't touch that, you psycho bitch! No, no! It's the only way! No. No. No, okay? No. No, please don't. Because that's what he wants us to do. Thumb on the scale. Okay? Think about it. No. No, please don't. Okay? Please. Good or evil. No, no. No. That's what he said. No, please don't. Let's just think about this for a minute, okay? Just think. We're supposed to follow the rules, we have to play by the rules. My only key to freedom is to kill you. (EFFORT GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) Please! I'm sorry. Please don't! Please don't! Please don't, please don't. I'm sorry. Backwards... (STUTTERS) He said we've got it backwards! No! (EXCLAIMS) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (STRAINING) No. No. No! No. No. No. Here's your key to freedom. No. No. No. No. We could have been free, Anna. I'm sorry. (GROANS) (GRUNTS) (GASPS) (COUGHING) (GROANING) Halloran. (GROANING) Help! Somebody! Help! What the fuck are these? What the fuck? These are goddamn laser cutters. What? What? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, what happened? Where's Eleanor? Someone came out of nowhere. Halloran! Drugged me. Knocked me out. Yeah, me too. JIGSAW: (OVER PA) Hello, gentlemen. You came looking for the game. Congratulations, you found it. You are the final two players. It can't be. JIGSAW: You may recognize the device around your collar, Dr. Nelson. These laser cutters slice through tissue, and bone, like butter. The most powerful blade on the planet. You both have an opportunity to live. All you need to do is confess. JIGSAW: It's that easy. Confess? If you admit to the reason that you deserve to die, you can escape death. I will be listening. Make your choice. How are you alive? How are you still alive? The game will select one of you to begin in 60 seconds. Unless, of course, someone chooses to go first. Let's neither of us touch a button. We're both gonna be fucked in a minute. I'll go first. Okay. (EXHALES SHARPLY) Wait! No, no, no, no! (BUZZER SOUNDS) No! No! Oh, God. I've done nothing wrong. No, stop. Stop it! I'd confess. Stop it! Okay, okay. Okay, all right! Yeah. All right, John Kramer! It was me! It was me! I fucked up! I messed up your X-rays! I was... I was careless. And I am sorry. I'm so sorry. I confess. I confess. (SCREAMING) Christine, I'm so sorry, baby. I should have been there for you, but I wasn't. (GURGLING) JIGSAW: (OVER PA) Your turn, Detective. (BUZZER SOUNDS) No! No, no, no! I won. I won. I won. What? Huh? Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Okay. JIGSAW: Confess. I did some shitty things. But the system's broken, I tried to fix it! Okay! Okay! I tampered with evidence. (STAMMERS) I took bribes. I put innocent people away. Murderers and rapists walked. People died because of me. Innocent people died because of me. I did it! (EXHALES) (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) (EXHALES) It fucking can't be. What? Hey, hey, hey... (PANTING) Wha... What is this? What are you... HALLORAN: What? Are you fucking kidding me? Logan, you're... What? What? Hey! What, you... You're working with him? I am him. What? And with a little help from you, no one will ever suspect it. HALLORAN: (ON RECORDER) People died because of me. Innocent people died because of me. I did it! I don't understand. Ten years ago, in this very barn, a game was played. Supposedly, John Kramer designed this for a game that took place before all the others. (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (GASPS) The bodies were never found. LOGAN: I know this because I was one of the players. Jigsaw put me in that game almost 10 years ago. I mixed up his X-rays. You need to cut yourself! (LOGAN SCREAMS) (GROANS) (PANICKED BREATHING) (PANTING) John decided I shouldn't have to die over an honest mistake. He gave me a second chance. So now, 10 years later, I've recreated Jigsaw's game with criminals from your failed cases. What? LOGAN: I wanted my game to be identical to Jigsaw's. So I went through your cases. Found players just like the ones in the original game. I gave them the same choices that Jigsaw did a decade ago. Jigsaw put five people in his game. I put in three. You and I are the last two. I wanted to see if I was as worthy as him. As talented. No... Come on, Logan. Come on. Have mercy. Like you just had mercy on me? When you started our game just now? Pushing my button? Saving yourself. What? Fair? That... that's not fair! Why was Edgar Munsen free? He was a murderer. But you were protecting him because he was your criminal informant, years ago, and you let him walk free. Edgar Munsen killed my wife. You don't... You don't know that. It's never been proven. (PANTING) This won't bring your family back. John Kramer, gave people a chance to win the game. A choice. Fuck! You fucker. You have a choice. Scream, or don't. Logan, Logan, Logan. Logan, hey, look, I can help you. I can do things for you. Can you bring my wife back? Doesn't matter what I say, does it? LOGAN: I created a game that appeared to be run by Jigsaw. JIGSAW: (ON RECORDER) Hello, Edgar. You're about to play a game. Five lives are in your hands. Follow my instructions exactly. I got to choose who dies, them or me. I'm not fucking dying. What kind of firearm do you use? Glock 22, most cops do. Except Halloran, he's got a 17. 9x19 Parabellum. That's a Glock 17. The blood under the fingernails of our first victim is John Kramer's blood. LOGAN: Some will think it's Jigsaw. Some will suspect you. But no one will suspect me. Okay, we need to bring him in. Now! LOGAN: Because Eleanor will provide my alibi. Oh, yes. LOGAN: Ten years ago, I came out of the war a broken man. Jigsaw put the pieces of my life back together again. He gave my life purpose. (BLUBBERING) We can never come from anger or from vengeance. You taught me that. But then there will be no justice. No. But there will. Because we'll speak for the dead. LOGAN: Together, we built a legacy. Now, I speak for the lives ruined by people like you. Murderers, rapists... Their victims appeared on my table because of you. No. No. No... No... (GROANS) I speak for the dead. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Original subtitles by Sud_Arun Colored and Improved by zer0_
