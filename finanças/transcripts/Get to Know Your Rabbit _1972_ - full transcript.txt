I haven't checked the Fairchild figures. When Andrews calls, I'll transfer that to you. The newcomb people have got to see you. In fact, deal with Knowles, too. 2 P.M. In fact, you've had good luck with stillwell-- right. Stillwell, 2:30. Donald? Hmm? Are you all right? Caletron's calling. It's urgent. Well, I can't put off that memo. Mr. Rogers, your call to Hawaii is holding. Mr. Beeman, Mr. Chandler has a flight in 40 minutes. I've got a folder with everything he needs. I'll send it over. [Telephone rings] [Telephone rings, intercom buzzes] Hello, beeman here. Excuse me, sir. No, I think I know what you're-- uh-huh. Could you hold? I'm sorry, but these went out without a signature from downstairs. Tell them it's pending. The previous agreement covers it anyway. When vacation time rolls around, too many firms all too often dis-- [Intercom buzzes] [Buzz] Beeman here. Let me check the date. 24th... Is an important factor that is-- [intercom buzzes] I wasn't to be disturbed. There's a lady on the line from a firm called up against the wall, incorporated. But, i-i-i-i-- yes, what is it? Is this Mr. Turnbull, vice president of servo-temp, incorporated? That's right. Good morning. This is miss Simmons, project coordinator for up against the wall, incorporated. Our organization planted a bomb in your office building. It's set to explode in six minutes. Let me put you on hold. Transfer this call to Donald. [Intercom buzzes] [Ticking] [Buzz] [Ticking] [Buzz buzz buzz] [Ticking] [Buzz buzz] [Buzz buzz buzz] I thought you were getting that. I'll get it later. Mr. Beeman, please call the operator. Mr. Beeman, please call the operator. Mr. Beeman, please call the operator. What about the meeting? Wasn't it supposed to be in your office? Not long and drawn out. I have the figures right here. O.k., good. Wait a second... Actually, it's the amount of our... [Ticking] Mr. Beeman, I have a message from miss Simmons of up against the wall, incorporated. They said they never send messages of this nature unless the situation is urgent. The message is, "60 seconds, and it's your corporate ass." Thank you. ...that the institute... [Explosion] [Door buzzer] [Buzz buzz] [Buzz buzz] [Buzz] Hi! I'm probably a little early. I couldn't sleep. Um... Is there something I can do for you? No. Just lead me to it. Just lead you to what? I'm Mr. Weber. Oh, good. The piano tuner. Oh! I don't have a piano. 9:00, Tuesday morning. Your wife made the appointment. Very lovely voice. Oh, thank you. I don't have a wife. No? I don't either. I am engaged, sort of. We haven't set a date or anything. We're kind of engaged. The mix-up about the wife is nothing, but... No piano! I've never been so far off target. I don't know the procedure. Why don't you come in, take a look, and make sure I don't have a piano. I believe you. Just a quick look. It will wrap this thing up. Well, I... I shouldn't, but I will take a tiny peek. Piano. Piano. Piece of candy? Oh, thank you. [Clink] Oh! Ha ha ha. Well, it's a wise man that knows his own possessions. There's no piano, sure enough. Donald? Donald, who's out there? Is everything all right? Mr. Weber, do you have a minute to meet my friend? I'd be delighted. Wait. I can make up for that piano thing. Oh, that's not necessary. Crawl back in bed. I won't be long. Donald, who's that man? Come in here. Come on! Hello? It's me. O.K. If I come in? Oh, sure. I'm Paula frankinheimer. I live here, too. I'm Mr. Weber. Weber! I bet you're Irish. I don't think so. I thought those were Irish eyes. Well, Donald. I thought a little breakfast would be just the ticket. That's, uh... Set it right here. That's, uh... That's fantastic. I didn't know you would do this. Just the niceties of life. That's nice. Hey, Paula. Come on over and have some of Mr. Weber's eggs. Come on, Paula. Come on, honey. Right over here. Coffee? She's a little grouchy sometimes in the morning. Have some orange juice. Oh, just a bit, but that doesn't mean I'm having a good time. Donald, I've been thinking. I've done all right today. I've really done o.K. You have. You've been fantastic. Coming into a situation unaware like this has made all the difference. It's been a real eyeopener for me. Maybe I don't need pianos anymore. I mean, all these years, I've been using pianos as a crutch in my relationships with people. You mean you're going to try to get customers that don't have pianos? It would take guts, Donald. It would take guts. Hmm... I don't know. Don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing, but I don't know. Well, I wish you all the luck in the world. Thank you, Donald. Jeez, it's exciting to think about. Donald, won't you be late for work? It doesn't matter. It's my last day. What? I left the water running. There's no water running. I left the water running, Donald. There's no water running-- Donald, I won't marry a drifter. Drifter? Paula, I've been working seven years. Very few drifters work seven years as marketing analysts in the servomechanism industry. Won't you tell me what it is you're going to do? I'd rather get into it a little first. Then I promise I'll tell you about it. [Piano playing] I shouldn't leave during a lesson like this. Donald, listen to me. I don't want you to go. Perhaps my wishes mean nothing to you. Yeah, perhaps they don't. Hear me out. I sure you're not the sort of man to go against the wishes of those near and dear to you. Surprise! Surprise! Huh-- mom! Hello, Donald. Dad, what are you-- what are you doing in there? Well, Mr. Turnbull wanted it to be a surprise. What can I say? I know you want to be alone with your family. I'll wait in the cab. I don't know what to say. We felt the same way when Mr. Turnbull said he was bringing US to see you. You know why we're here. Mr. Turnbull says you have gotten mixed up with the wrong sort of people. Oh. Mom... It's none of his damn business. Whenever I stop at the filling station for gas, I always tell them, "from all I hear, "Donald's doing very well as a young executive in Los Angeles, California." That's nice. Dad, there's nothing to worry about. By the way, they redid the filling station in Spanish hacienda style. The lube job section has a cathedral beam ceiling. He doesn't care about that! I was wondering what happened to that filling station. As long as you're out here, we should spend time together. We'll have dinner tonight. I should have had you out here sooner. Could be a nice long vacation for you. Oh, it sounds nice. We've missed your flight back, but the train is just as fast. We don't want to overstay our welcome. You just got here! Just stay till this evening. The dinner won't be long. We don't want to cause any trouble here. I guess Disneyland is out. We'd hoped to see it. There's no chance now. Stay tonight. We'll go to Disneyland tomorrow. We really didn't want to see it much, anyway. Listen, don't--they've got a hotel at Disneyland. We can spend the whole week out there. Well, don't worry, darling. We'll write when we get home. Bye-bye. [Turnbull] Hurry up. Hurry up! All aboard, please. Now boarding for flagstaff... Donald? Donald? [Telephone rings] [Ring] Donald, phone. Hello? I can't... Hold on, just-- sorry, we're in the midst of the rehearsal. Hello? This is Paula. Tell me, why am I always the last to know? You're not last to know. You must be second or third, unless turnbull's been telling everybody. Don't expect me to be here when you come home. [Whirring] Glad to see you. I didn't think you'd be here. You look tired. Oh, it's... It's been a long day. Homework? Hmm? I said is that homework? Each student is issued one of these on enrollment. I brought mine home because the instructor said, "get to know your rabbit." I got a good rabbit, too. It doesn't suit you! Hey, Paula, let's not go through this again. I can't help it. You used to look so nice with your attache case. It was a handsome color, too-- burnt umber! [Machine whirs] [Turns machine off] Turn around. Why? Just turn around. Give me a kiss. No. No. No? Hey. Let me see that ear. Remember when you first moved in? When I got home from work, we could never decide whether we were going to eat before-- yeah. I think it's coming back to me. Yes, it is. [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Paula giggling] Ah... Yeah? I am not going to accept your letter of resignation. I didn't write a letter of resignation. I know, but I assumed one would be forthcoming. I think this is something that'll wait till tomorrow morning. I'm hanging up. Who was that? That was turnbull. He was trying to get me to change my mind. Oh. Incidentally, that reminds me. What's that? Don't touch me! Leave me alone. What the hell's going on? I made a rule. You're not to touch me till you give up this crazy scheme of yours. When did you decide that? Yesterday afternoon. What about last night? Last night was an exception. [Door buzzer] [Buzz] Look, Mr. Turnbull, i-- I forgot the most important quality of a top executive. The ability to improvise. Would you let me lead my own life? I figured out how neither of US has to worry about a letter of resignation. You've taken a leave of absence-- an indefinite leave of absence. Fine, fine. Well, good night. I wrote an announcement to send to the papers. "Donald beeman, long-time market--" do you want your middle initial in there? I really don't care. A good middle initial can add a lot. Donald! "R" for example. "Donald r. Beeman." Let's do it now. I've got to have it now! Oh, Donald! Come on. That's what I thought! I'm packing! What's going on? What are you doing? Let go! I'm sick of your crazy games. You weren't to touch me until you quit those lessons! You're the one that suggested it! That was a test. That was a test? I thought it was another one of your exceptions. How about it? "Donald r. Beeman"? I don't care. Just leave it like it is. Paula, I will stand here until you come out. "Donald beeman, long-time marketing analyst "with servo-temp, incorporated, "has taken an indefinite leave of absence "to devote more of his time to various personal interests." Do you like it? It's not true. Paula? You're acting like a baby. The only thing that bothers me, it's the same announcement I released about Kramer after he tore the dress off that secretary. Don't bother seeing me out! Will anyone notice the similarity? We can discuss this! Why-- you're just going to walk out? You're really acting silly. Paula-- ah! Ah! Paula! Give me another test. I'm sure I'll do better. Paula, what about the... What about all... Donald, just say the word if I've come at a bad time. [Meowing] I noticed you have rooms by the month. That's right. I better warn you, no loud music after 10:00. I think a room here would fit in with my new way of life. May I help you? Yes. I'd like to see something seedy. Come with me. [Tap dancing] No. No. No, no, no. Look at your hands. Look at them! You're holding your rabbit all wrong. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, rabbit! [Knocking on door] [Knocking on door] Look here, Mr. Turnbull, this has gone far enough. This must be it. No doubt about it. I thought you were somebody else. Is this a five-day party or not? No, it's not. Call me Vic. What do you call yourself? Uh, Donald. How the hell are you? Donald-baby, why don't we find the party? I was going to rehearse with my rabbit. Your rabbit. Ha! That's very funny. Put the rabbit down. We'll go and find the party. It would be crazy to miss this party. It will be going on for four or five days. I guess my rabbit won't mind. They can take care of themselves. Four-day party, huh? I'll get the door so nobody takes your rabbit. It's a lot of people from the field of glamour. Think it will be a wild one, huh? It better be! Yes? What did I tell you? Call me Vic-baby. This is Don-baby. Sure it's all right? Oh, sure, honey. [Crowd is very quiet] My name's flo. I'll let you meet the others on your own. [Flo humming] [Flo] Let's have some drinks. Hi. * boo, boo, boo, boo * boo, boo * this has been going on since last night? That's right! Ha ha ha! Chip? It's going to go on for four more nights? That's right! Oops! Hey, cheers! Until the booze holds out. We may go on even till Wednesday! Maybe even Thursday. Boop! Boop. Um, are you, uh... Are you with anybody? Is that type of cheap broad with no brassiere ever with anybody? Can you count on a girl with no brassiere? Nowhere. Go on, ask her. Tell him. Hi, my name is Susan. Susan! Ha! I love it, huh? How do they come up with names like that? Ha! Susan. Let's get out of here. Wait a minute, Vic-baby! I gave you a bum steer with this party. There's a wild place I was saving for later. Leave it to me! We're going to have one hell of a bash. I hope you realize I got you in the back seat with an expert. You can tell she's the type of cheap broad who knows what to do in a back seat. I don't know how to ask you this, but... How long have you been a cheap broad? Well, it's an off-and-on thing. Don't worry about me, Don-baby. I removed the mirror so I can't see a thing back there. It's nice. It's very nice. Now, is that nice or not? Sweetie, with that model there, you can get into any high-tone place in town. No, don't, don't primp, darling. Nobody likes a primper. Now come out. Let's see what you look like. That's right. All the way out. That's right. Uh-huh. That's nice. That's very nice. Is that nice or not? Yes, it's very nice. It's nice. That's what I said. Donald, the show's over here. Know what I like about this, Donald? L and s. Never forget that. It lifts, and it separates, Donald. It lifts and separates. Huh? Is this all we'll be doing? Her just trying on bras? These are brassieres, Donald. Oh, yeah. Brassieres. You'll learn. Don't worry. I need a clearer picture of the situation. Keep your hand there. That's right. We need a variation on the theme. Something with, maybe, mediterranean overtones, huh? O.K.? Just stay here. I'll be a little while. I'll turn on the muzak. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back. It's like really... Wires and pads It's, um... Nice weather we've been having lately. Yes. Would you care to dance while we're waiting? Yes, I'd like to dance. What's wrong? I just realized something. I made changes in my life three weeks ago. You're the first sign that things really are different. [Door opens] Wait till you see these. I didn't know I had these in stock. Look at this. Take a look. Oh. Look at this model. Here's a model that would reflect your basic earthiness-- basic earthiness combined with a sense of breeding. It's good the night is young. I got other models. It's awfully nice of you, but I'm just not in the mood anymore. What do you mean you're not in the mood? We were all going to have a wild time. It's, uh...I guess it's just because... Oh. Oh. Just because, maybe the... Oh, it's the muzak. The tango came on. Bullshit, muzak! I was just... I know what's been going on. I'm beginning to get the picture. Right? Cheap broad like this, she's always up for grabs, right? You saw your chance, and you took it, right? I step out, you make your move. I know how this will end. It always ends the same way. You'll go to your hotel, a little small talk, then powee, right? Huh? Spring them right on her-- those fancy models with the seamless lace trimmings. Give you added reinforcement with the underwiring for enticing push-up? And those cocktail brassieres? I know. With the d.P.C.? Those deep plunge cups? Yeah, and the other freaky models, huh? Give you extra push-up for added oomph? Stuff in your room that will make my merchandise look like crap! I don't know what kind of guy you think I am, but I wouldn't take a lovely girl and do that. Vic, this is no way to end the evening. Yeah, you're right, kid. I get carried away by my fixtures sometimes. Hey, no hard feelings, huh? No hard feelings, Don-baby. You, too, sweetie. I hope that sometime, someplace, I find a girl that can appreciate a good medium-priced brassiere. See you later. Yeah. My ship sails away tomorrow, so we must make tonight last till eternity. [Horn blowing] Is that you, Mr. Delasandro? Yes. For a moment, I thought it was somebody-- I didn't know if it was you or not. Some of your friends on board? A former pupil of mine who performs for the entertainment of the passengers. That sounds impressive. It's responsible. She's on 24-hour call to distract them in case of emergency-- if the ship should start sinking, for instance, or if any ugliness should occur during the lemon dance. I don't suppose there'd be any openings like that for me. I wouldn't say that, Sonny. Yesterday, I heard about a seven-week swing through the second-rate bars and cocktail lounges of america's heartland. That sounds exactly what I was hoping for. We'd never get you ready in time for that. What if you gave me extra coaching lessons? I could work 24 hours a day. To work that hard would be unfair to your rabbit. But I can see that you're sincere. We could start working this morning. Then I'll have to be at my most ruthless and demanding. You may even learn to hate me. Well, I don't care for you much anyway. Later, perhaps, that hatred may wither into the dry husk of admiration. When you remove the silken foulard from the bowling ball, you must do it tenderly... For it is, in a sense, a farewell. True, in a moment, you'll whip off the scarf, revealing a pitcher of milk, but there must be implicit in your performance a lingering sense of nostalgia for the bowling ball. O.k. This is no time to eat. I have to be cruel to be kind. I told you "tenderly." Now make it tender. You'll never get the shim-sham. Let's reprise on the delasandro special. Go on. Now then... I'm the heckler, right? I've been needling you for the last 10 minutes. Time now for you to strike back with all the style and wit at your command. Up yours, fella! Not bad. Not bad. Well, Donald... I guess you realize what this means. The real thing, huh? The incredible escape sack. No other feat can equal it. Step up to the podium... Into the sack. Once you have mastered this, there's nothing more I can teach you. Now, imagine, if you will, that I am a lovely young volunteer from the audience. Now, even though we are tightly sealed in the sack, I, the lovely young volunteer, will escape from the sack in a puff of smoke. I... Shall I pull this-- I, the lovely young volunteer, will escape... In a puff of smoke! I'm sorry. I didn't-- sorry? Sorry is simply a word. Actions are what counts. This is based on a simple mechanical principle. Let me pull on the-- there's my elbow. Well, it's someone's elbow. It's your elbow in my face. I thought it was-- I don't like an elbow in my face. In 10 minutes I'm taking a cab to the heliport in Wilshire, where I catch a chopper to L.A. international, where I hop a 727 to Cincinnati. Believe me, it's no picnic. [Delasandro] Who is it? Seager. Is the kid there? Yes, I believe he is. Great, great. We were just... Resting. Don't think you're getting a peek at this contract, kid, till after the graduation ceremony. Mr. D. Knows I don't go that route, right? Right. [Donald] Is there someone out there I should meet? Mr. Seager, just to test your wits... How about seeing if you're clever enough to unfasten the top of this? This is an era fraught with peril. Yet I cannot help but feel that when a young man completes his studies not one, not two, but three weeks ahead of schedule, it bodes well for mankind everywhere. That young man is here with US this morning. Will Donald beeman please step forward? Donald beeman... I hereby designate you tap dancing magician magna cum laude. Pass your hand through the candle flame. What? Pass your hand through the flame. It's symbolic. Was that too quick? No, it's all right. My god... I don't call myself a sentimental man, but there's something about a ceremony like that that just tears me apart. How did you do that? Ah, never mind. As a graduation present, a card for your wallet and a tap dancing magician's t-shirt. Can I open it now? I don't care what you do. I'll get the contract ready. Hoop-la. I didn't know you had these. [Seager] Contract's ready. Once I thought the tap dancing magician craze would make a bigger splash than it did. Get yourself a manager, and you won't have to worry about paperwork. Sign here and here. I marked the places with an asterisk where you double as an emcee for the strippers. Oh. Seems awfully quick. I almost forgot. Here. He only does that for guys he really likes. What's this for? Travel expenses. That will put you on a bus to Elgin, Illinois. Donald, before you go... Would you like me to look upon you as the son I never had? No, I don't think so. Thanks. I hope it's not a decision... [Door shuts] That you shall regret. Elgin, Illinois. Thank you. At gate two, now loading for flagstaff... Mr. Turnbull? Mr. Turnbull. Mr. Turnbull. Mr. Turnbull. You got no right to bother me. I got my discharge papers right here. Honorable discharge, 1949. It's Donald. It's Donald beeman. Donald. Donald. It's o.K. Let's get out of here. Donald. It's going to be o.K. [Clears throat] I must have dozed off while I was waiting for my cab. Sure you did. Come on now. Tell me, what happened? Donald... When you left the office, suddenly the work began to pile up, and I got a little behind. Then a whole lot behind. So, I began to sip an occasional cocktail before lunch. My secretary was very helpful and sympathetic. But you had left the office, Donald, and nothing helped me in the end. Donald, I was a top executive for 14 years. 14 goddamn years. And now look at me. Sure I need a shave, sure I could use a drink... But, Donald, you think about this-- I haven't had an office...An office in I don't know how long. [Sobbing] Hey, look at me. Come on. Look at me. I got an idea. The guy that signed me up for the tour said I needed a manager. What about it? Just an office would be enough. I wouldn't expect you to trust me with an actual job. My manager. It will be fun. It seems to fit in with my new way of life. Here we are. Here's a contract I got from Mr. Seager. His card's stapled to it. Fine. Well, I think we'd better paper-clip this card to the contract so it doesn't go astray. Oh, you don't have to do that. Oh, this one ought to do just fine... Like so. Yeah, but it's already stapled-- well, you never know. What do you mean? A man must do the best with what he's got. All I've got are paper clips. Well, I, uh... I better get going. I wish I could spend more time. I'll send my forwarding address. Oh, fine. I'll, uh... I'll make a note on my memo pad of your first stop. Elgin. Don't go slow for me. Elgin, Illinois. [Claps] Come on, boy. Come on, come on. [Barking] That-a boy. [Dog whimpering] [Drum roll] Thank you. Thank you very much. It's great to be in your fine little town. Hit it, maestro. And now, the grand finale. [Clapping] [Clapping] Whoo hoo hoo! [Donald] Dear Mr. Turnbull, having a fantastic time on the road. You should try it, honest! My rabbit caught a little cold but is fine now. That's fine. That's fine. I'm really living life at the gut level. Yours truly, the magnificent beeman. That's catchy. That's fine. Hey, Mr. Executive! Tired of the rat race? Live life at the gut level. Try our 17 day drop-out plan. Tap dancing magician, inc. Hotel fair oaks. Suite 32. [Soundtrack music plays, no dialogue audible] [Cheering] Come on, I know you can do it. I need a few pointers. She's the Indiana bombshell. Every curve, loaded with dynamite. Every curve, loaded with dynamite. I don't know exactly what that means. If you go into it too deep, it ruins it. Introduce her in your own words...Now. [Music plays] Ladies and gentlemen, I would like your attention... For, in just one short moment, a lady's going to come out here and take off almost all of her clothes. There you are, ladies and gentlemen, the magnificent beeman. Thank you very much. You've been a very warm and wonderful audience. For my grand finale, I will do one of the most daring and dangerous feats ever done before a live audience... The incredible escape sack. [Clapping] I will need a lovely young volunteer from the audience to participate in the incredible escape sack. A lovely young volunteer from the audience will help me with the escape sack. Come on, folks. We need a volunteer for the magnificent beeman and his incredible escape sack. Charlotte, please. How about you, young lady? Oh, come on. How about you? Come on, folks. The magnificent beeman and his incredible escape sack. We ought to have some cooperation. Isn't there somebody that would like to volunteer? How about you, young lady? He needs a lovely young lady. Oh, i-- won't you volunteer? Encourage her. Well-- how about some applause? [Clapping] Come on, for this lovely young lady. Will you? Yes, you will. Well-- you don't have to do anything. Will you go? That's right. Come on, folks, some applause. We have a volunteer for the magnificent beeman. Step right up. Mr. Beeman, I'm so happy to be here. Right into the incredible escape sack. What are you going to do? When you do that trick with the rabbit, you are just so good. It's the best thing I've ever seen. Thank you. I worked very hard on it. All right, incredible escape sack trick. Put your hand into this. The young lady will put her hand into the incredible escape sack spot for the hand. You're very pretty. Glad you think so. This doesn't hurt, does it? You're a terrific-looking girl. Really? Oh, I'm glad you think so. Do we-- daring and excitement in the incredible escape sack. What do we do? Take this magic cord. This won't hurt? I wouldn't dare hurt you. You're so beautiful. Ohh... We are ready! And now, ladies and gentlemen, the magnificent beeman and his incredible escape sack. Maestro... [Drum roll] One, two, three, escape! Aah! Aah! And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time on this stage or any stage, the magnificent beeman and his incredible escape sack! [Scattered applause] Maestro. [Drum roll] Escape! And escape! Ah! Ha! [Giggling] Ohh! Oh ho ho! [Scattered applause] [Band plays] Oh! Ow! Hurry. Hey! Whoa! I believe this is our cab. There's a vicious thing in a big bag that's chasing-- thank you. [Crash] Come on in. [Coughs] Oh, god! It's them! What? Those are the hands that... Take the rabbit out of the hat. Oh, they just make me shivery. Ohh! Ah! I realize these are hands that can do magic, but I'd rather have you think of them as just ordinary hands that just... Just ordinary hands. Ohh! I've never had any real heroes. Except, maybe... Roger. Roger was the paper boy when I was in the seventh grade. Yeah. I used to deliver papers in sixth grade. Roger would come down the hill on his bike. He made these beautiful tosses. He could put a newspaper... Oh, I don't know-- just anywhere he wanted to. It was beautiful. I did that, too. I threw right- and left-handed. Hit a mailbox 40 yards away. When Roger did it, it was really beautiful. Always beautiful. Finally, one Sunday, I snuck out of the house and met him and went on his route with him. It was almost light when we finished, and we sat on somebody's lawn and read the paper. I read every section. Everything. I wanted him to know I was interested in his work. When I came home, my parents were up. My parents decided that it was sordid. They took the harshest measures they could think of. They canceled the paper. But you know what I did? I called the paper and told them I was my mother. I said that we'd reconsidered. We wanted the paper, but could they deliver it under the back porch? All summer long, Roger delivered the paper in secret. He even gave me my own receipt card... That they punch? I hid it in my dresser drawer. [No dialogue] Um... Uh, I didn't tell you everything. Sometimes I didn't have enough money to pay for the paper. So... I had to pay for it in other ways. Does that bother you? No, no. That doesn't bother me. I mean, I remember I had trouble budgeting my allowance. Oh, and you know what? Another thing about Roger is he always was a gentleman about it. And he always used to... Punch my card beforehand... Rather than afterward. [Click] Ohh! I--sorry, I thought-- is Mr. Turnbull still-- he's in the John. Don't worry. He's quick. Mr. Turnbull, are you ready for-- oh, I thought you were Mr. Turnbull. No, I was just-- he's not back yet. That's funny. He's usually very quick. [Toilet running] Donald. Donald! I can't tell you how great you look. I thought you'd be spending your money on muscatel. They're ready. Fine. Send them in. Gentlemen, please! Mr. Linder, please. Oh, thank you. That's fine. Let's see your hat. You look really wonderful, wonderful. Thank you. All right, Mr. Reid, yes. That's very good, sir, very good. Fine. Wonderful, wonderful. Mr. Greenbaum, that's fine. Let me see your cap. That's good. Thank you, sir. Thank you. It's very, very nice. Now, let's see, Mr. Colbert. I'm sorry. I don't like that jacket on you. Would you change that, Reynolds? Of course, sir. Is he getting special attention? Never mind about him. I have a right to know. I'll explain it to you later. Look, my contract, Mr. Reynolds, says-- Donald, be honest. Isn't it great to be working together again? Do those guys have some-- [power saw] [Hammering] [Tuba plays] Oh, let's see. I like this one. This is very good. This one's wonderful! I like that very much. This one is good. Donald, would you please help me with these? Thank you. Do all these guys work for you? Donald, be serious. These men earn an average of 55 thou a year. We don't like to make deliveries. That's all we need. Thank you. I'll take those back. Thank you. Oh! By the way... I lined up another tour for you. Here's your itinerary. Oh. "Pathean, Nebraska." Hello. I'm Donald beeman for Mr. Reese. He's over there. Excuse me, Mr. Reese? Hmm? I'm Donald beeman, tap dancing magician. That's going to have to wait. My wife just called. There's a man under our porch. Come on. Well... Hurry up! [Burlesque music playing] [Man] Hey, you from beaver falls, honey? Whoo! Whoo! All right. Right away, dear. Fantastic, huh? They loved the rabbit and the American flag bit. That was my wife on the phone. She did a damn dangerous thing. W-What thing? She poked at that guy under the porch with a pole. He ran out across the street and up a tree. Fire engines? [Police radio] [Policeman] Watch out for my car. [Woman] Does he look familiar to you? [Man] I don't know. He moved up to that branch. All right, forget it. Come on down. What's the matter? Ladder's too short. It's too short. I thought the fire department had big ladders. [Policeman] Did he look like an airline pilot? [Fireman] I didn't see him that good. An airline stewardess is coming who can identify him. Nothing here, nothing there. Ha! Ohh! Ha ha! That's marvelous! Good evening. I'm miss Collins. We think we've located your pilot. At first we thought it was my brother-in-law Ralph. Follow me, miss. He was underneath the porch this afternoon. Now he's up a tree. He's over by the ladder. They brought the fire truck with a ladder. Is that him? I didn't think he'd get so far. That's him. What's the matter with him? He gets butterflies worse than the other pilots. If you get him down quickly, you can probably get him back to O'Hare in time for his 11:00 flight. Shouldn't he lay off for a few days? No. He should get back up-- like climbing back on a horse after being thrown. I'll get him to the airport in time. He may pretend he doesn't, but he knows the way. All right. Everybody move back. I said everybody back. It's not good to have too many people involved in a situation as delicate as this. You dumb bastard, you got 10 seconds to get the hell down! [Door opens] [Girl] Aah! Aah! Who was that? Oh, I've seen him around, but... We haven't actually been introduced. [Coughing] Young man. Young man. Hey, young man! I'm awfully sorry to disturb you, but I can't reach my pillow. Thank you. Oh, no, no! This is my hard pillow! I wanted my soft pillow. [Gunfire] [Screaming] We interrupt this program for a special on-the-spot news report. The passengers were trapped for a perilous 14 hours until the rampaging flood waters subsided. What began as a pleasant, almost placid, bus trip turned without warning into an ordeal--excuse me. The bus is pulling in now. We'll see if we can't talk to some passengers. They're lowering crates for the passengers to step out on. Excuse me, sir. What thoughts-- uh, ma'am. Excuse me, madam. I know words often fail at a time like this, but if you could give our viewers some idea of your harrowing ordeal. I don't know what we would have done without that wonderful man. Yes, a driver who clearly gave his all. No. The man who entertained US. He danced into the morning hours. He performed magic tricks that were simply amazing. In other words, a wayfaring troubadour, as it were, who took it upon himself to cheer those who knew not what-- there he is! Excuse me, sir? This way. According to this lady... Are we on television? You took it upon yourself to cheer those who otherwise-- no. Let's just say, I like to live life at the gut level. Yes, well... Um... Could you tell me where Mr. Turnbull's office is? Big building. Huge building. I haven't seen a building this big in... Next! Pass your hand through the candle. Next! Pass your hand through the candle. Next! Pass your hand through the candle. Next! Pass your hand through the candle. [Woman] The 17-day plan provides for appearances at a total of 10 night clubs and your rides throughout the entire state-- I'm looking for Mr. Turnbull's office. This is the annex. You want the new building-- down the hallway to your left. Thank you. Excuse me. Do you know where Mr. Turnbull's office is? Anything wrong? No. I'm just looking for him. Take the elevator to level "b" and level "a." Uh, what... Look, I know this is the workhorse of our line, but the pilot's project shows we're just beginning. Response to our wino prototype has been tremendous. I'll show you the statistics. Attention! An unidentified rabbit is loose. Will the ensnarement engineer please report to area "j"? There he is! Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! No, you don't! No, you don't! No, no, no, no! Mr. Higgins. You know how we frown on keeping credit cards. All right, let's, uh... Excuse me, uh... Can you tell me where Mr. Turnbull's office is? Turnbull? This is processing. You don't want processing! You want administration! Don't ever come through processing when you want administration! Attention! An unidentified rabbit is loose in area "j." Will the ensnarement engineer pleasereport to area "j"? Hello. You must be our Mr. Beeman. Welcome home, Mr. Beeman. Oh, thank you. This tap dancing magician thing sure has taken off, huh? Yes, and it's all because of you. Yeah, well, I guess I really got it... Ahem! Is Mr. Turnbull in, please? Yes. He's expecting you. Why don't you go right in? Leave all that here. I'll watch your bunny. No. I got to take him. O.k. Go on in. Uh, Mr. Turnbull. Hello, Donald. Hi. Come on in. Wonderful to see you. Um... What are you doing in here? Actually, it's-- it's quite pleasant. Uh... The only trouble is, if I close the door all the way... The light goes out. Ha ha ha ha! Tell me, uh... How are things with you? Fine. I've really been enjoying myself. Hey, what's the matter? You can tell something's wrong, can't you? God! I was hoping that it wouldn't show. Donald... Let me tell you. Donald, I'm scared. Scared of what? The whole thing. I was o.K. As an executive in the servomechanism industry, but I can't handle this. Go on tour with me for a couple weeks. It'll straighten you right out. Do you realize how many people are depending on US? US? Yes! Do you realize how many? No. I don't either. I've been afraid to find out the exact number. That's just part of it! Let me show you something. I can't go out there alone. I'm right behind you. This is just the preliminary groundwork. You see that company right there? It's one of the largest corporations in the world. They're coming tomorrow to start negotiations. That doesn't sound terrible. What do you mean? Just let them buy US out. No! You don't understand. We are buying them out! Oh. I can't handle it alone. Sure you can. Not with executives of this caliber! One of them has had his picture in u.S. News & world report three times! I guess...I mean... It can't be so bad. I'll sit in for a while if you think it'll make any difference. Aw, thank you. Thanks, Donald. I knew you wouldn't let me down. Five minutes to go. [Intercom buzzes] Yeah? There's a long-distance call from marietta, Ohio. I don't know anybody from marietta. Oh. Ohh! [Raining] [Woman's voice] Uh-huh, uh-huh. It's just that I thought that you'd be here. It's one meeting. I'll be-- sorry your name isn't on the door. That's o.K. That's o.K. Well, next week, I'll be in, um... Friday--terre haute. You're not mad about the door? Oh, I'm not mad. Yeah, next Friday. Mm-hmm. Yeah, me, too. Hey, got to go. Bye-bye. Donald. You sure you're not mad? Positive. I'm fine. I was just--just thinking. I do that myself sometimes, just drift off into thought. Well, we ought to get on down to the board room. Yeah. Just take a deep breath. O.k. Thanks, Donald. Gentlemen... I'd like to introduce to you Mr. Donald beeman. Donald? Mr. Beeman was right behind me. I've got a meeting to go to. Something much more important. You'll enjoy this more than that meeting. I love magicians. Magic is my life, Mr. Beeman. You haven't seen my tricks, Mr. Beeman. I want to see your magic wand. Miss Parsons! I won't hurt your magic wand. [Crash] I believe that's Mr. Beeman preparing in there now. Donald. Uh, Mr. Beeman will be right out, gentlemen. Sorry. I'm running behind schedule. Didn't you get my memo? This wasn't necessary. He agreed to come to the meeting. Mr. Beeman will be right out. Donald. Good day, miss Parsons. Gentlemen. Just working with my rabbit. Mr. Donald beeman, Mr. Arthur g. Erickson. How do you do, sir? Mr. Clarence harcourt. Nice to meet you. Mr. E.B. Webster... Morning, Donald. How are you? You wouldn't believe that freeway today. I was practicing some routines-- lunch is out today, but tomorrow for sure. [Typing] [Telephone rings] Mr. Beeman's office. No, I'm sorry. He's in conference. No, I don't-- Harrisburg? So far as I know, he's scheduled to remain here in Los Angeles all week. Well, Donald, back to the old grindstone, huh? Connors, let's get cracking on that interoffice memo. 1, 2, 3, escape! [Applause]
