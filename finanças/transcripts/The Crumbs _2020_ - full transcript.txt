Go. - Turn here. - All right. Let's go. - Who could that be? We're not expecting any guests. - Okay, move. Who else is in the house? My daughter and the doctor. - Doctor? Call him. - I'm Dr. Crumb. What's going on? - He's shot. - All right, all right. Take it easy. I'm gonna check your friend. All right. Okay, all right. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. Just take it easy. Hold it here. Lenny. - Let's fucking move now. - All right, all right. - Let's go. - All right. Just take him this way, now. - Let's go. - This way. My laboratory's this way. - Give me some tape. - Take it easy, easy. - Give me some tape. Sit down. I didn't mean to wake you up. Damn, you look good. Even in that granny gown. Go upstairs. Go! No. - Turn around! Give me your hands. Hurry. Quicker. - That thing in my face isn't helping. Quicker. Quicker, man. Stitch him up. Hurry up. Five more minutes. We're almost done. We're almost done. - You're going to need to change that dressing. Oh fuck. Fuck. - No! No, please, please no. Mother, you all right? Victoria, are you all right? - She's okay. He's still in her room. - Get him out. I want that filthy body out of my house. It's all right. - Hurry up, Leonard. The doctor wants to use those herbs at full potency. Oh, and tell Dr. Benjamin to come in for supper. I've made something very special. - There you are, dear. All done. Now, remember to eat all your meat. Protein is important for you. - Look, these are the new herbs. Mrs. Crumb said to come in for dinner. - Right. How have the reservations been, Mother? Wonderful. I just love this time of year. We get so many visitors. - Dinner was delicious. Thank you. Leonard, excellent harvest this year. Your herbs are the highest potency I've ever seen. I'm testing them now, and if my suspicions are correct, it will produce a higher strength serum, which means lesser amounts can be used to greater effect. - I am so proud of you Benjamin. And I'm proud of you too, Leonard. Oh, don't forget to empty and clean those bins tonight. Yes? Thank you. So much. - Good evening, um. Mr. and Mrs. uh- - Smith. - Uh yeah, that's us. - Please come in. - Where're we goin'? - Wow, it smells good. Have you uh, have you seen my uh, my guy? Is that sausage? - Yes, it is, sausage and gravy. It's my own special recipe. Oh, oh please, sit. There's the table by the piano. Breakfast is important, you know. - Well uh, have you seen my guy? - Oh, he, he went for a walk with Leonard. I think they went to see the workshop. - Oh, great. Went to the workshop. Thank you. - When you finish, I'll take you there. Oh my. - Well, that's that. Now what about that girl? I want her tested for compatibility. - Resting quietly. But I already ran her toxic screens, and uh, she has opiates and other street drugs in her system. - Mm, too bad. Well, it shouldn't be a total waste. How's the freezer, Mother, is it full? - Well, you can never have enough for the winter months. Oh, but don't bother yourself, dear. We'll take care of it. As soon as you've finished, we'll have lunch. - All right. Sheriff, there's a Mr. Angel Valente here. Says he's a private investigator looking for a missing person. - Have him meet me out on the old road. - We're going to town. - Mother, well, what about lunch? - Oh really, Benjamin. Surely you and Leonard can fix something. - Leonard. Here you go, Dr. B, just how you like it. - Nicely done, Leonard. I want you to know, I think of you as a son. I hope you know that. - Dr. B, can I ask you a question? I've been with you folks for as long as I can remember. My grandma and grandpa raised me here. I been eating this meat all my life. How did you folks come to eating flesh? - Hm. In times of great desperation, war, depression, famine, a man will do whatever it takes to survive. The Great Depression, for example, people were starving. We didn't. Frankly, it's a waste to bury those who've sacrificed their lives for science. Realizing they're rich in protein, Mother created a curing rub, which, as you well know, has a wonderfully savory flavor. - So you recycle them. Makes sense. - The next town is 32 miles that way. We don't get too many visitors out here unless they're lost. There's no hotel, and the only motel is the Lucky 8 you saw as you entered town. Mostly truckers there. - Well, that's interesting 'cause Banesville area was the last reported sighting. - Oh. - There's no other area or a place where somebody could stay? - Not really. Well, there's the Crumbs' place, but it's one of those bed and breakfast places. You have to make arrangements in advance. - Yeah. - Lovely people, the Crumbs. Been in the County as long as anyone can remember. If you care to talk to them, they're about a mile down the road, can't miss it. - All right. Thanks, sheriff. - You bet. Hey, you know, I'll ask around the Lucky 8 for you. Thanks. - Well, good afternoon. Aren't you the cutest couple ever? - Good afternoon. We are, miss, miss- - Forgive my husband, he doesn't speak English very well. We are Mr. And Mrs. Francisco Soliz. Newlyweds. Do you have our reservation? - Nothing to forgive. - Ah. - Now, now, beautiful. Uh, uh, uh, uh, buenas tardes. Oh. - Please, please, come in, come in. - Gracis. - Enter, por favor. Oh, thank you. - I will be stepping out, but oh, I'm gonna leave you in good hands, I assure you. Uh, Victoria and I have a few errands to run in town, dear. - Very good, Mother. - Mm. - Well, uh, through here I'll show you where your rooms will be. - I'm sorry. We wanted to surprise you with a snack. - I love fresh salsa and guacamole. - What happened to the music? Ah, I thought something had happened to our guests. What can happen to us here? We'll be leaving early in the morning. We want to see the sunrise from Mystery Rock. Be careful up there. - You guys are so special. We will be back. - Well, lovely, thank you. Mother, enjoy. - My husband would like to cook something special for dinner. If you don't mind. - Uh, yes, yes. Why not? - That would be wonderful. - Yes, it would be. Mother, shall we retire to the other room? Please. - We found a freshly butchered piece of meat. It looked like pork. I hope you don't mind we used it. - Okay. - Not at all. And yes, it is freshly butchered. Well, I don't see any beans. I thought you Mexicans always eat beans. - Father, that's offensive. - Oh? Well I didn't mean it like that. Well, the good thing is he can't understand me anyway. Right? - Mm, perhaps we should do more eating and uh, less talking, Benjamin. - Now, what is this special dish? - Carnitas. - Oh. - Yes, carnitas. - Huh. Hm. Leonard. When you're finished come in for lunch. We're having the carnitas the Solizs left for us. - Sorry to bother you. My car broke down on the road. I think that it overheated or something. Can you help me? I was on my way to a photo shoot. I'm a model. I just must've taken a wrong turn. I can't seem to get any reception. - How 'bout a cold refreshment? - It is hot. How 'bout some lemonade, and I'll take care of your car. - Have you lived here long? - Since a girl. I was raised on this property. - I guess you like living out in the middle of nowhere. - It's our home. That is somewhere. - Oh my gosh. This is so good. - Well, well, well, who is our new friend here? - I'm Ricki, with an I. My car broke down and your boy's trying to fix it. - Oh, well, my boy's name is Leonard. And I am Dr. Benjamin, Ricki with an I. And uh, I think I'll go take a look at your car. - Well, to unexpected car breakdowns. Right? Could really use a nap. - Not a problem, dear. You can nap upstairs while Leonard retrieves your car. - She's perfect. - Perfect. - I'll have Leonard take her to the workshop. This is a fortuitous day. Be extracting hormones, pineal, pituitary glands. Ah, that's better. Shall we begin? Is no one going to get that? Dr. Benjamin Crumb speaking. Can I help you? I see. I understand. No problem. Thank you for your concern. - This is Dr. Benjamin. Why don't you show him the photo? - Too bad, looks like a nice guy. How long has he been missing? - Little while. - As you probably know, all of our guests make reservations. - How 'bout you? You seen this man? Perhaps in town? Okay , I'll take that as a no. - Here you are, please take this. I season and age the meat myself. I hope you find that poor man. His wife must be miserable. - Sheriff Martin says you're the best cook in the county. Thanks. - Thanks, folks. - Remember to empty those bins tonight. - What? What did you find? Let's see. Do you like them? What else? I'll wear them for you tonight. - I laid out your favorite dress for you. Let me help you. You have such beautiful skin. You began the serum at the right time, when your skin was still young and smooth. Hopefully you have many more years remaining young and beautiful. - Do you like Leonard mother? For me? - He loves you. He will take care of you. - Yes. I love you, Mother. - They may have come through here. The Lucky 8 is where they would land. How long you been looking? - A while. - Where are they from? - Sacramento. - Sacramento. Bit of a distance. You from there? - Close by. Hey look sheriff, I'd really appreciate it if you could keep an eye out. - I sure will. You know, I, I hate to hear this sort of thing. Do you have a card or a way I can reach to you in case I hear something? - I left my number with your dispatcher. She knows how to get ahold of me. - Alrighty then. Then I suppose there isn't much more I can do. - Thanks, sheriff. - Absolutely. - Appreciate your help. - Yeah. I'll keep you posted if anything comes up, and I'd appreciate it if you did the same. Like I said, I hate hearing of this sort of thing too. - Sheriff. Hey. - I don't mean to interrupt. Kinda lost it back there. - Yeah. I can see that. - I don't have anything big enough to loosen it up. - Leonard, why don't we help this gentleman fix his bike. Just follow Leonard. Mother. We have a new guest. A strapping young mountain biker. - Really? I don't recall any reservations. - No, he doesn't have one. Where is Leonard? - Round back helping the man fix his bicycle. These newfangled things confuse me so. I loved that outfit. - Perfect. - Hm. Oh, we can do better than that. Victoria, please bring our guest some lemonade. - Here you are. Do you like it? - It's very good. - The road leads straight back into town. - Why don't you join Victoria and I for a late lunch? We have plenty. - I'm Michael. Damn. Must've been a slow leak. Looks like I'm staying a while. - My family owns several hundred acres, mostly woods. I thought. - I, I'm not angry, I just, I've never been kissed. I mean, by anyone other than my parents, or Leonard. - Leonard? - We need to get back. He'll be looking for me. - Did you two have a nice walk? - We did. I showed him the woods. - That's nice. You can stay the night and leave in the morning. Leonard can take your tire into town. - No need. Uh, I have a spare tube. So uh, but yeah, I can uh, get a fresh start in the morning. - Your room is at the top of the stairs. Clean towels are in the shower if you wanna clean up. What's wrong? - He might've taken a picture he shouldn't have. - Oh dear. Get his phone. - I'll handle it. - No, I will. - What are you doing with my phone? - Don't fret, dear. It's all going to be over soon. - Thank you, Father. - You should've left. - Hey, we're only a few minutes up the road. Whew. It's so green here. It's great. Well, it better be nice. There's people there? - Oh, keep complaining. I showed you a picture. We are at the front of the house. Not exactly what one would expect when described as, "the cottage in the woods." Although, it certainly is in the woods. Uh, at this time, there are no life forms present. But wait. We have, wow. - Hello. - Hello. Do you have a reservation? Yeah, we've, we've got reservations. - Victoria, are these our new guests? - Victoria? - Yes? - Oh, I'm sorry, I was, I was just repeating your name. That's how I memorize someone's name I don't wanna forget. - Well then, what are your names? - Well, I'm Spencer. That's Kat, Lens, and Sandy. - I'm Irene, and I hope you like tamales. I have a wonderful recipe a guest shared with me. Well, bring your things and come inside. - Wow. Whoa. So many birds. Oh! Leonard, Benjamin, our new guests. - What's the wifi password? Why what? - Really? The wifi? You know the internet? - Sure, the internet. We don't get it here. - Uh. Where the hell are we? No internet? Shit. - Mother, why don't we have the internet? - Why? - I'm just wondering why we don't have it. That's all. - Well, we don't need it. - Why? What's wrong with the internet? - Well, nothing, it's just uh, not for us. - Why not? Why don't you want me to have it? - You don't need it. - What don't you want me to find out? - There is nothing there for you. - All right, here we are with the big guy in his natural environment. Hey. Hey, big guy. Uh, how do you know the difference between these herbs? - I just know. - Just know? - That's all. - That's good, yeah. Keep it going. - That's it. - We went walking. I was just showing him around. - Yeah, we were just like walking over there. - What the foe was that all about? - It, it's all right. - Uh. - They need to leave now! - Whoa, Leonard. - I want them gone. I, I want to- - I understand. Spencer, isn't it? But they are our guests. They have reservations. You know this. Listen. They will be gone soon enough. Be patient. Be patient. - You think the doc would let me interview him? Why? - 'Cause he's totally cool. I mean, look at this place. Yeah hey, Dr. B, what do you say? How 'bout I interview you? - No, I don't think so. I'm not that interesting. Already tried the big guy, but his vocabulary is rather limited. Uh, no offense. - Chill, Lens. No need to burn him. - Well kids, till morning then. Victoria, shall we say goodnight? - Okay, this place is totally weird. What's up with the creepy doll? - Dude, who cares? Victoria is flaming hot. - What? - Bet she can't dance. I'm just sayin'. - I bet she can do the horizontal mambo. - Behavior. - Just saying. - Is that all you're thinking of? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - What's weird for me is they act like they're from the 1800s. The doctor with his fob. Victoria, the way she dresses. - I'm tired. Let's just leave early and have breakfast somewhere else. I got diarrhea from that meat. - Ew. What happened to you? - There's two of us here. Serves you right for being greedy. - Who's there? Oh, cool. You want some? - What is it? - It's pot. What? Afraid you'll get addicted? - Nevermind her. It's okay. How long have you lived here? - All my life. I grew up here. - Are you sure you don't want a hit? Whoa, did you see that? That was huge. - So what's up with the Mystery Rock stuff? - I mean, haven't people disappear up there? - Uh, I, I don't know. - That's a legend, Sandy. Right? - I've never been there. I've heard stories of people who have disappeared. - Ooh, sounds creepy. - Is this a private party? - Oh my god, Spencer. You scared the crap outta me. - Cool. I have a question to ask you. What are you doing all the way out here in the middle of nowhere? There's like, nothing to do. There's no dancing. There's no music. You like EDM? You know, Calvin Harris, Timmy Trumpet. I'm really not sure what kind of music I like. - Okay. What about guys? What kinda guys you like? - My kind. - Whoa, man. Chill. - Victoria. You're smoking pot? If your mother were to see you like this, she'd be very upset. You should go home. You're leaving in the morning, right? - Yeah? - You're leaving in the morning. Right? He creeps me out. Do you see the way he looks at her. - Yeah, yeah. Give me the damn pen. - Had a feeling I'd find you out here. Watching him. I know how you feel. You cannot kill him. In all our years yet, we have never harmed a guest with reservations. Am I clear? - We are in the Crumbs' backyard. To my rear are the woods. Ooh, spooky. The yard runs right up to the edge of the woods. At night you can almost hear the Wolfman howling at the moon. Over here's the workshop. Dr. Benjamin's got his laboratory in there. Wonder what kind of experiments he does? Let's see if we can get in. - Can I help you? - Just, shit! I didn't see you walk up. - You wanna see my lab? Yeah, yeah, sure. Very cool. - I'll get the lights. Don't touch anything. - Ooh, it's cold as shit in here. - Well, this is where I conduct my medical research. I am studying the causes and effects of human cellular degeneration, and the effects of certain natural substances on processes. - You mean like, stopping the aging process? - Precisely. - Wow. Uh, how, how's it all work? - I have created a serum that coats the cells in a substance that prevents carcinogens from destroying cell tissue, thus preventing cellular degeneration that causes aging, disease, and it makes the cell growth stronger. - Fountain of youth. - It doesn't reverse the aging process, but it arrests where it is. So that if you started taking it when you were eight, you would always appear to be eight, but you would feel younger, and you would never get ill. - So, so if I took it now, I'd stay like this. And I wouldn't get sick. I'd look like this forever. Unreal. Excuse me for saying, but that is totally fucking cool. Can I try it? - Mrs. Crumb needs to speak with you. - Ah. Well, Lens here was just asking about the serum. I was totally just blown away, dude. - I can prep him if you like. - No, that, that won't be necessary. - Yeah, prep me. - No, I think it's better for you if you get back with your friends now. - It was a pleasure meeting all of you. Oh, and uh, I prepared some prime cuts for you to share. - Oh, thanks. You know, aside from the wifi, it's been pretty cool. - Yeah, the shits only lasted one day. - Oh, shits and giggles. Who could ask for anything more? - Hey, I was gonna ask you. Do you have like maybe a phone or an email or- - I recommend you get gas before you leave town. - Okay. Okay, well, it was nice to meet you. See ya. See you later, Dr. B. - I don't like them. - What a pity they had a reservation. - I don't know, he better- - I don't know, but he needs to hurry up because I'm starving. Well I hope he's gonna get some zebra cake. - I wanna get a burrito bowl. - He'll bring something. - Well, that's- - Hi. - Really amazing to say that. - Hi back. - Are you from here? - Why? - I'm looking for a place. A cottage? - Oh, you mean the Crumbs' place? It's down the road a couple miles. Oh my god. It's about time. Okay, I'll take these. - Thank you. - Bye. Did you see how hot he was? - Is this the cottage? - Yes. Do you have a reservation? - No, I got the address off of a flyer. - Are you looking for a room? - Just for tonight. - Please, come in. I like your motorcycle. - Your room will be the first at the top of the stairs. And uh, you are free to use the facilities if you like. Or you could always eat with us. - By the way, I'm Cameron. I'm Irene and there's Dr. Benjamin, and Leonard. And- - I'm Victoria. - Thanks. This is good. Can I pay you now? You know, just in case I don't get another chance. - Okay, um, that, that's 60. - 60. - Leonard, could you please get the key. And your motorcycle is fine right where it is. Excuse me, Father, have you seen our new guest? - Oh, Cameron? No. Isn't he in his room? - I don't know. - Mother! - Oh dear god, Benjamin, you don't have to shout. - Have you seen the boy? - He's not in his room? Victoria, go and knock on his door, please. - Reading a very interesting chapter here about California horse ranching. This would have been excellent information to have had about 25 years ago. Oh no, Father! Oh, what is it? - He's overdosing. Heartbeat's still strong. I'll need you to induce vomiting. Let's get him to the workshop. Get him up. Come on. All right. Go ahead and swallow it, swallow it. Good. You're all right. You'll make it. Mother, I'd appreciate if could repair a seam in the trousers of my brown suit. - I don't have time today. I'll take it into the tailor. - Well, that was disappointing. He was a healthy specimen. My, my, my, my, my. - Oh, don't worry, Mother. I'm sure everything is fine. - They're probably lost. - Well I hope they didn't get cold feet. - Are you bored, dear? Me too. But, you are looking much better. Are you feeling better? There's my girl. Excuse me, Leonard. Jennifer, what the hell are gettin' us into? - The ad said they're just simple country folk. - Simple country folk? Look at 'em. They're frickin' hicks. - Hi, you must be the Klines. - We are. We made a couple of stops. I bought some dates. Do love dates? - Uh, you need to excuse her- - I just love them. - She's a little bit of a talker. - I think she's just excited. I hope you're hungry. I made something special for you to snack on. Leonard, could you please take their bags into their rooms? And when you're done, please park their car. - Good evening. - Hello. - I'm Dr. Benjamin Crumb. - Nice to meet you. - You're a tall drink of water, aren't you? - Neurosurgeon? Way out here? I don't get it. - Dinner, Ms. Crumb, was fantastic. I wish I could cook like you. - Huh, me too. She has trouble boiling eggs. - Thank you, dear, very kind of you to say. - Let's play a game. Charades. - Huh? - Okay, I'll go first. - Naughty girl? A stripper, huh? - No. - A prostitute? - No. - I think we need to tone it down a little bit. - An exotic dancer? - Yes. An exotic dancer. Come dance with me. - I can't dance. - I don't think this is actually really- - Sure you can dance. If you can move, you can dance. Come, I'll show you. Ready? Mm-hmm. - Arms, shoulders. There you go. It's fun, right? Good job. All right. You ready? You wanna try something fun? You ready? Okay, let's do it. - What the hell, Jennifer? - Oh no, I'm so sorry. Oh my god, I'm so, so sorry. I think we've had enough. - You know what, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Kline, this has been interesting, but, you know how to find your rooms. - I, I didn't mean to do that. - Goodnight. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. - We're gettin' outta here. - Benjamin, get down here. - What is it? - They're gone. - Well, bullocks. - They left this morning. - Leonard, from now on, never let the guests' keys out of your sight. - It's okay. Anyway, she was nice. I'm all right. - You're in luck. We just had a cancellation. Come on in. - Oh, here we are. Victoria. You look great. Color is back. I think we can maintain for a while. He's healthy, and alone. So he can be our guest for as long as we want. Now, I'm sure you're hungry so, let's not keep Mother waiting. Come along. I thought you might like something to eat. The doctor will be in soon. I hope you're comfortable. You all right? What're you doing out here? - I couldn't hold it. Didn't wanna entertain any passer-bys. What're you doin' out here? - You gotta do what you gotta do. - Yeah. - Patrolling. You coming or going? - You been sheriff a long time, right? I mean, you seem to know about everything and everybody, like the Crumbs. Tell me, does the doctor still see patients? - What's to know? The Crumbs are just regular folks leading regular lives. - Huh. Right. Well, it's getting kinda dark out here. Guess I'll be getting back to town. - Leonard, prep the donor. - I'm afraid we're too late. - No, no. Dammit. He must've just expired. Well let's not let it be a total waste. He's still fresh. Leonard, wrap and dress the meat. Mother, please tell Victoria I'm sorry. - Hello. - Hi. We're the Archers. We like to get straight to the point. - He thinks he's being funny. Um, we saw a post on Facebook. - We don't have a reservation. - Oh, well, this is your lucky day. Our reserved guest canceled. Oh. Thank you. - Victoria? Dear, could you ask Leonard to come and collect our guests' bags? - Oh, bags? No, um, this is it. - Well. Dinner will be ready in an hour. - Oh, don't worry about us. You know, we brought our own food. Where do you keep your bowls? Bowls? - To soak my nuts. We're vegans. - Huh. Figures. - Wow. You got quite the set-up here. - Get the woman. - Boo. - Please, don't hurt me. Please. - Go get Victoria. I'll prep the donor. Lovely. - Benjamin. Benjamin. - Mother, what's wrong? - Where's your father? - He's in the workshop with Leonard. - Please go get him. - Mother needs you. - Take the SIM cards out of those phones and destroy them. Mother? Oh, whatever is the matter? - Look at my face. I'm aging again. - Mother. - It's okay. We knew this could happen. - Come to the workshop with me. I have something for you. Mother, I feel very strongly about this new compound. Thanks to our vegan friends, we have more than enough to mix the new batch of serum. - And Victoria? - I finished earlier. I feel fine. - You are such a good doctor. - Yes, well I suppose I am above average, aren't I? - They were lost. And now they're found. - You little bitch. - Dammit, Mother. You should've waited for me to make an extraction first. Now her platelets can't be salvaged for Victoria. It's too late. Put this in storage. Clean this mess up. She's getting worse. She hasn't got long now. I need to replace her kidneys. - How long? - Few weeks. Months at best. - Your father would know what to do. - You don't have to hide the truth. I'm certainly old enough. - You can't leave. This is where you belong. Here, with me. - You don't understand. I'm not normal. This is not normal. - You just need more serum, that's all. - I don't need more serum. You don't get it. Do you? - I want to marry you. I love you. - Oh my Leonard. Oh my big, beautiful Leonard. I'm a hemophiliac with a club foot. My parents are my grandmother, Irene, and my father, Dr. Benjamin, her son. Her son. I'm a product of the worst kind of coupling, incest. - So? - My kidneys are damaged, Leonard. I heard them talking. I've only got a few weeks left. I don't know, maybe more. They need replacing or something. - I'm not giving up on you. - Look at this one. That's Dr. Benjamin. - I don't know. It may be his grandfather. There's a striking resemblance. As for the body, the doc often helps out the county corner. Not unusual. - I have to come clean with you, sheriff. The girl in the photograph is my niece. - I'm sorry to hear that. How long has she been missing? - About a month. Her father died, my brother. - Are you really a licensed PI? - I'm investigating what happened to my niece. I, I just get this really weird feeling about those people. - Tell you what. I'll meet you out there tomorrow. We'll take a look around. - Okay. Thanks, sheriff. - You bet. Morning, Dr. B. - Morning sheriff, pleasure. What brings you out? - I asked him. - No big deal. He says he may have found something I'd be interested in. Mind if I take a look, doc? - Sure. Leonard, show Sheriff Martin and Mr. Valente around. - Let's look in there. - I apologize for the mess. If I'd have known you were coming, I would have made the place more presentable. - What about the body? - Oh, you saw that. Sorry. Poor girl. Sent her body back to the morgue after I finished my autopsy. It was a homicide. - I hope you feel better now. Dr. Benjamin is a good man. If you wanna look some more, we can go back in there. Irene said to give you this. Enjoy. - What's wrong with Leonard? - Nothing's wrong with Leonard, darling, he's fine. - Then what? - Oh, Victoria. Do I really need to say it? - Say what? Leonard is my friend. - I know. But he's not family. Family can be more than family, you know? - I, I don't think that way. I mean, about you, other than family. - Why not? - I want to be with Leonard. Not you. You're my father. Remember? - Victoria, I... Well she's a grown woman. She's lonely. - Oh, I know. I only want what's best for her. And of course I like Leonard, but he's- - What? He's what? - Oh, Lenny. You're an educated person, be logical. - What does logic have to do with this? Why don't you just say it? Say it! - Lenny. - Lenny, calm down. Lenny, calm down. Lenny. - Stop, Lenny. - Say it. - Stop. - He's black. - I didn't mean it like that, Lenny. - Lenny, please, please, let him go. - Please. I'm sorry. - Please. - Benjamin, stop. - That boy- - Stop it, stop it, stop, stop. Stop it. Okay? Look at me. - Why, hello. Hi there. Nice pole. You goin' fishing? What are you fishing for? - Whatever's hungry, I guess. - Hm. What kind of bait you using? - I have some worms that my daddy bought for me. - Oh. Well, where's your daddy now? - He's doing other things. Chop wood. - Oh. Well, you know what. I happen to have some of the best bait in the county. I'm Dr. Benjamin Crump. I live in the big house just up over there. You know what, if you follow me, I'll fix you right up. And, Mrs. Crumb, just baked a peach cobbler today that I think needs taste-testing. You wanna come with me? It's just right through that way. I know you probably don't want to hear what I have to say. I understand. I just never figured this. I hope you can accept my apology. I'm sorry. I never meant to make you feel like... - Like what? - I met someone in the woods. I need you to take care of him for me. He's uh, beyond the brush in a small clearing. - He lived here. Did you get everything? Yes. - The bin is full, unless you need it. - No. - Bury him in it. - I already did. I want to show you something. Please, Victoria? Please? Don't peak. I said don't peak. Okay. You can look. - You did this for me? Why? - Leonard. Victoria. Where did she come from? Did you find her? - Leonard did it for me. - For her transplant. They were out in the woods. - I must run several tests first. They? - She had a friend. He's done. - Give her an IV. Prep her for testing. I must check for compatibility. Keep her quiet and out of site. Take her to your place. And what if it fails? - I don't know. But we owe her this much. She has nothing else. - Hi. I'm sure you didn't expect to see me back. I'm sorry I didn't stay to say thank you. Or goodbye. - I am sorry. You know, you folks were very kind to me. Saved me and, I'm glad you did. - Well we are very glad to have you back. - Yes, and uh, we have no guests. So you're welcome to stay the night. - Yes, stay. - Sure. Why not? - Well that's settled then. Leaving again? - Sorry, I didn't see you coming. Uh, no, not till the morning. - I'm glad you came back. You look happier. Can I ask you a personal question? - Sure. Why? - Why did I leave? Why did you try to kill yourself? You, you, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I just, I, you look like you're well-cared for. - Well, too well-cared for, that's, that's part of the problem. - I don't understand. You're handsome, and I mean, you seem to have money and... - I have a fiance, and she's beautiful and a nice person, but I don't love her. I love someone else. - Who? Who? Who is it you love? I'm sorry. That, that's none of my business. I shouldn't have asked. - I just, I don't think you'd understand. My parents certainly wouldn't. - Why? Is it race? - I love women, but I've never been in love with one. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I don't even know you. - Well maybe that's why. We don't know each other to judge each other. It's getting a little chilly. Would you like a cup of coffee? - Yeah. Let me get that. You two have gotta be right out of Homes and Garden. You remind me of my grandmother. She recently passed away. God, I miss her. I mean I, I could tell my nana anything. I used to call her nana. Silly, huh? I guess I still call her that. I'm gonna miss her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just- - Oh, no, no, no. What's wrong, what is it? Stay. - I'm sorry. I just can't help myself. Oh, sh, sh, sh. It's okay. It's okay. You remind me of my late brother. He was the sensitive one. He too was special. You should never be ashamed to be who you are. You are a handsome man. I'm sure that the person you love, loves you back. And that is all that counts. Right, Victoria? - Yes, Mother. - When I finish here, I will prep your patient. - Very good. Go bring Victoria down, and begin her transfusion. - Victoria. Dr. B will be ready for you soon. - For what? Dr. B wants you in the lab for serum injections. - Who? Who is the donor? Motorcycle man. - I don't understand. - You said she would be okay for awhile. - She will be, but this is an opportunity to give her system a badly needed boost. - Father, we can't do this. - What're you talking about? Of course we can. We need to. Leonard, where's the donor? - He's not a donor. He's a person. - Of course he is. They're all people. But he doesn't have a reservation, does he? Leonard, go get him. Why? We don't need him yet. - Of course we need him. I can put the serum in storage, but Victoria needs this transfusion. Now Leonard, go get the donor. - Huh-uh. - I won't do it. - Victoria, wait. He's perfect. This is important. This is your life. - What about his life? - I don't understand. He's a perfect fit for Victoria. She needs this transfusion now. - We can't do it. Not him anyway. - Why not? He doesn't have a reservation. - Will you stop already with this reservation crap! - Irene, we swore to this. This is important. - And you swore not to do harm to others. Remember? Don't lecture me on ethics. My work is for the good of all mankind. - Don't you lecture me on the importance of life, Benjamin. Cameron is, Cameron is very special. - Precisely why he must be the donor. - He's not like the others. He's gay. - And? He's very healthy, and a perfect fit for Victoria. - He will not be the donor. - Bloody hell. - Thank you. Victoria, thank you. - I want this done immediately. She cannot stay at Leonard's. - Well, first I need to get- - Benjamin, I said I want it done immediately. - Yes, Mother, we'll do it tonight. Leonard, go tell Victoria. - Sheriff Martin, please. Angel Valente. Tell him I found a missing person's poster of the girl with her throat cut. Yes, cut. Just tell him I'll meet him over at the Crumbs' cottage. Thank you. It's okay, just, okay. All right, just, quick. Okay, go, go, go, go. Okay, okay, okay, wait. The road's right there. Now you go. - No, you have to go with me. - No, no. You contact Sheriff Martin. No, no. I have to go back. Go. Go. - No. How did she get loose? She'll try to report it. - She must've had help. Her boyfriend? - Buried. Mr. Valente? He didn't leave? - Find him and find the girl. They couldn't have gone too far. Help me. - Get in. Calm down. You're safe now. You're safe now. I got you. Now calm down. - Stop right there. Put it down. Put it down. Get over there. Get over there. Turn around. Turn around. Get up that hill. Go on, move. Move. - Leonard. - Get back. Get back. All right. What's going on here? You sick degenerates. - You couldn't possibly know what's going on. This is beyond you. We are trying to save someone we love. What would you expect? She's our family. - Do you have children? - I had a niece, who you killed. Get the fuck back! - Let me make you an offer, Mr. Valente. I can help you live as long as you want. True. With no illness, and no further aging. - Yeah, how? By killing others? What gives you the right to play God? - Somebody has to, Mr. Valente. - About damn time. The girl on the missing persons was here. They killed her. They had another one over here. I helped her escape. - I picked her up on the highway. She's in my truck, safe. - Get back! Turn around. - Do as he says, Lenny. - Put your hands behind your back. - Good afternoon. Do you have reservations? I prepared some sandwiches for you boys in case you got hungry on the way. Meatloaf. - Bears. Come on. - Where's our rifles at? - I said leave. - Go. - Now. - When we get to this tree- - Uh-huh? - Just gonna run like hell. When you get to the top of the ridge, I'll meet you on the other side. - All right. - Ready? Let's go. - Go. - Mother, your appetizers are delicious. Can't stop eating them. - How 'bout you, sheriff? - Oh, if I eat one more, I might turn into a wienie.
