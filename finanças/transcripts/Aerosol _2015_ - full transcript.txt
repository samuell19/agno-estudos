Before this Era, there were four Eras when humanities lived not as perfect as ours, who lived off of vegetables, not as perfect as maize. These four Eras were named "Suns". Every single one perished because of a cataclysm provoked by the struggle of the gods, Tezcaltlipoca and Quetz♪lcoatl. The Ocelot Sun, Sun of the Earth ended when numerous Ocelots inhabited the Earth. The Wind Sun was destroyed by a cyclone. The Rain Sun was destroyed by a rain of fire from the heavens. And the Water Sun was destroyed by the Great Flood. After the flood that ended the fourth Era, came the modern age: The fifth Sun, Sun of movement because it moves, will end one day called "Nahul Ollin 4 Movement" the day of the great Earthquake.

I didn't study for that, I didn't study my ass off to come here and play dumb. And now it seems we are even fucking the kids? Can't you see? Are you blind? Really? You don't care for the reason we are here? Okay, tell me. How much? How much are you worth to play stupid? Huh? Whatever you're worth, whatever you have, you won't get to take it when you die. Think about it. It got all fucked up when you left. You killed Sergeant Figueroa's courier. It was a fucking mess. The ones who didn't cave... got taken care of. - You tell it so carefree, bro. - I tell it like it is! Fucking Nuk... We who got on board have where to drop dead. Damn it Nuk, there might be even something in it for you too. No... No, I only came to see the old lady and brother and I'll go back. And what about that Licha? Not going to find out what's up with her? I can tell you where she works. I don't know. Calm down Nuk! I'll help you! I can make your files disappear, just like that! After all, the gang's the gang. Come on man, forget it. There's plenty of girls. You're going crazy because she's a spoiled girl And to have those girls, you need shitloads of money. And you don't have that, man! I don't give a shit. Look Look! Like that! We have to be like that! They were just fistful of dudes who came here with nothing. They started from the bottom and conquered everything. What are you talking about? We have to start a gang... and then we are going to sell drugs. If we sell drugs, we get money if we have money, we get power. If you have money and power, you can have whatever bitch you want. And then what? We'll end up working for El Loco? No, dude! No! El Loco will be working for us. Think about it. Where do you want to be? Down there? Or up here? Girl, the other day... Remember? It was crazy! - Hey! You need a ride? - We don't get rides from strangers. Me? A stranger? Don't you remember me from the F.B.I.? That we dance in the same place doesn't mean we know you. Don't mind her. She's upset. If you don't give me a chance how can I get to know you? - I'm not getting on. - Aww, please! - Come on, let's do it. - Let's, I'm tired. - No, no, we are not going. - Come on! - Let him take us, just that. - Come on!

And the gun? Where's the fucking gun? In my house. Fucking perfect. From now on, we don't go out without the fucking gun! Are you crazy or what? Do you want me to get into trouble? Look at that brat! He's got a gun and he gets more money working for El Loco than us selling those stupid discs Yeah, but he's right. We are not a gang. Oh, really? That's why we should make one! No one will take us seriously without money. CDs! CDs! Cds! So when are we going to meet for the F.B.I.? - Ten, right? - Ten? At ten. What did I tell you about the fucking gun? What♪s up, you fucking showoffs? Trucas, trucas, calm down, come on, let's go. Leave it, let's go. Pay up bitch, everything. The money too. What? Is it clear now? Hey kid, let them go. Now, leave! Go on, Leave! Let's go. Calm down dude. Fucking kid. Won't give no slice to that brat no more. If we had brought the gun we wouldn't have been humiliated like that. And you're still thinking about that bitch! Don't drag her into this! Come on man, calm down. Your brother wouldn't have let this happen to him. You think you know what would my brother would've done? Kill them! He's not a little bitch, like you. - Ok, that♪s it. - Cool it. - Is he crazy or what? - Yeah, just forget him. Dude, fucking stop that! That's why some asshole is fucking your girl! - Tren, Tren, calm down! Forget him! - What? Is he mad or what? - What's your fucking problem? - What the fuck do you want? Shut up! You're shitty leader! I don't know about you, but I won't live like a dog with its tail between its legs. Don't worry dear, they're looking out for us. What♪s it gonna be? Dust or stone? Dust. What do you want? Can we talk? All right. What do you want to talk about? They'll pick me up soon. Who's gonna pick you up? That♪s none of your business. You and I broke up, remember? - This was a mistake. - What do you mean a mistake? Yes a mistake! I told you I didn't want to be with you. Drama I don't get you! You never get me! You only understand what you want! I don't want to be with you anymore. They'll pick me up soon. Please go. Alicia? - Thank you - You're welcome. I thought you would never come back. Why did you? I just wanted to check up on my old lady, and my little bro who's really messed up right now. And recover lost memories... Am I one of those memories? yeah ...yes. Nuk, look me in the eyes. It wasn't your fault. Maybe. Everything changes with time. No, people don't change. But they can get better. What's up Trucas? Come on guys! We're buds!

Look, what do you think about my painting? You like it? More or less, it's not my style you know? So what's your style beautiful? - Can we go?

Breathe. Are you alright? You need to rest. What's up Tren? How're you doing? You fucking cowboy, you were awesome! And Trucas? Who knows? We haven't seen him since last night. And Drama? - I knew something could happen. - It's not your fault. You always told him to stop doing that kind of stuff. He had it coming. - I want to see him. - You should wait until he feels better. I can't. Calm down, he's not going to find out, and you were already broken up. What are you going to do? - What are you thinking about? - About the asshole that shot my brother. - Come on, leave it. - No, I can't... He almost killed him. There♪s nothing you can do. Are you sure? Help me find Papel. Is that why you're back? The last thing I knew is that he was a hobo. Ask Bung, he knows where to find him.

Bringing honor to your nickname, on the floor like a fucking paper. - Do you know the name of this church? - No. Concepci♪n Tequipehuaca The fucking Spaniards built it on top of a Mexican temple. - Here's where they found Cuauht♪moc. - The football player? Fuck man! The last Aztec Tlatoani! - Do you know what the name means? - The footballer's name? - No! The church's! - I'm kidding, man. "The place where slavery started." Drugs are another form of slavery. So... Are you going to help me? Of course I will, Nuk The gang's the gang. Humberto! Write this down! Male infant. Around 9 or 10 years old. 11? Shot by firearm on the posterior area of the thorax. From the skin aspect we calculate he's been dead 6 hours - What happened? - You should take a look at this. So... that guy there found him. That guy... The one over there. Partner, go check it out. Don't worry, when I got here there was no one here yet. Good morning. You found him? Yes. I found him on the floor.

And not only here, everywhere on the neighborhood. Welcome Ram♪rez, always a pleasure. As always, the best quality Let's see. How's the family doing? Good shit. Ram♪rez, always a pleasure making business with you. 25.4% of kids between 12 and 15 have consumed drugs One kilo of pure cocaine = three kilos of refined cocaine One gram of cocaine sells for $200 mexican pesos One kilo selling as 3,000 grams for $200 a gram a week makes $600,000 About $2,400,000 per month. Annual Global production is 800 metric tons, about $84,000 million USD Drug consumption has multiplied 4 times in the last 10 years, and is the cause of death of more than 200,000 people a year Hey! What♪s up! - How are you doing? - I'm alright. - Feeling better? - Yeah. - What do you think? - They're cool. Fricking cool, right? Hey, all of this is over there? Yeah, yes, it is. Look, over here, this one right here. We made that one. It♪s really cool! - This one... this one♪s mine. - Really? Yeah, I painted it on Eastern lake. The thing is that I had a teacher, a Chicano teacher that taugth me to respect the murals. To value the muralismo art... That's why I painted all of this. It's not about painting like dogs marking territory - This earns you respect. - Respect? You're wrong. In the streets, in the hood, in the country, money gets you respect. No little bro, not at all. Above everything else, there's talent. Money is below talent. If you think about it, people with money buy the work of people with talent. Even... if you're born with money, it doesn♪t mean you'll have talent. But that if you're born with talent, the odds are good you'll be able to earn a lot of money. Completely different, you know? You think it's worth it getting killed because of painted walls? - I'll get some sleep. - Okay. You need to rest. Hello? Rata? I need to meet you in the graveyard. Okay, see you there. Why the fuck did you wanted to meet here, Nuk? Don't play dumb fucker! - Man, he works for the Cartel del Centro. - And you? Who do you work for? Who do you work for you fucking hypocrite? - Figueroa offers them protection. - They're killing kids, damn it! - Yeah, we did it too. - No, not like this. It wasn't like this. It wasn't? You're right fucker! You're absofuckinglutely right, it wasn't like this you cunt. Did you forget? If you hadn't killed that fucker we wouldn't be in this mess. There's shitloads of money in this. I'll help you get this guy. Count me out, I won't do it. You better be careful, this will explode soon. There's lots of them Nuk... and they♪ve got guns. Boss! Boss! Look what I found! The infamous Nuk! I hope you understand the thing with your little brother wasn't personal, it was just business. Business? That happens when you defend your own. You should know Nuk. We do as you did. But I don't think you're here for chit-chat. What the fuck do you want? If I knock you out you'll leave. A fight? Don't make me laugh. It's on fucker. Let's dance. Let♪s see it what they say it's true Nuk Get up bitch! Just like the old times Nuk! - You'll need more than this to kick me out. - It will be done. Take them! - What's up bro? - What up. I♪m going to fuck that son of a bitch. No, no, no... Stop thinking about that please. Trucas is right! We have to form a gang... Stronger, better. A gang? You did. And they feared you. That's what we want. Respect. You'll see, that motherfucker will pay. Gangs, crews, violence... It's not worth it. Worthless. It makes no sense to think about that. I don't give a shit. I♪m going to kill that bastard. Kill? Kill? Do you know what killing is? It hurts, and it hurts like hell. The one you kill, loses weight because he becomes lighter. Because you feel him in you... because he sucks the life out of you. Because a part of you goes with him... Because you see in his eyes how life flows out of him and how it takes yours. And then you spend the rest of your life waiting for it to happen to you. Remembering the look of the one inside you haunting you, thirsting for vengeance? And it never leaves you, and it never, never rests? Think about it... Because that's what will happen to you if you keep it up. Did they forget? You're a fucking murderer. Trucas? Trucas? Wake up! Damn it man! he's real sick! Trucas? Help me get him up! - No, no, no... - We must take you to a hospital! You need a hospital, you're real sick! - Trucas! Go get a taxi! Run! - Run! - Trucas! - Trucas... Trucas... Leave me alone... let me sleep. I'm tired. No!!! Okay. This time we're gonna get this motherfucker. - How are you feeling? - A lot better? - And you? - More or less. - We should get out of here. - Where? The beach. Nuk was telling me about some beaches he knows... I guess we could go. Let's ask him. As soon as he gets back. Nuk was killed! He was killed! - What? - They killed your brother man! What do you think? A witness told us 4 tattooed men threw him from a van. There are some cops willing to testify over there. - Don't you understand? - Go away! Why? But I care about you! Calm down! A bro I haven't seen in years! This guy is really heavy, drugs, guns, the works. What do you mean you don't know? The only battles worth fighting for, are those who help you fulfill your dreams - Easy, it's okay. - I don't want to live like this - We have to tell the police - It's not that easy. - What do we do then? - I don't know. Tren, that guy almost killed you. - We should get out of here! - Calm down! We are worthless to him. You'll meet me on the F.B.I. tonight? - Promise me you won't do anything stupid. - No, I promise. - What's up man? - What up. - The gun? - In my backpack. How many bullets? - I think two. - Let me see. This won't bring back Trucas... nor your brother. I'll see you later. Is it clear? This hood is mine! What are you looking at, bitch? Do you know what my job is? Do you know? My job is to be the fucking king of these streets. I'm in charge here. Is anyone going to challenge me? No one is going to challenge me? Who's got the balls? - Grab my backpack. - No, we should leave! - Calm down. - Let's leave! - Tren Leave it, just take it easy. - What are you going to do? No one? Me. You again bitch? This time I♪ll kick your ass. Get up. Get up! Get up if you've got balls! He's a little bitch just like his brother. Is that all? If you are a man get up! Fight! - Did your bitch tell you I fucked her real good? - Shut up! You're fucked now. Give the gun. - Leave him alone, bastard! - Get off! - Do you fear death? - Why fear? if we live, we die. And that is true for you and for me. And when you kill me, I♪ll get inside you... and I'll make sure you end up in hell. You've got some balls... I'll let you live, to see you suffer every day. But then again, I don't believe in that shit... Time to say goodbye, bitch. The gun! "Because hate is never stopped by hate. Hate is stopped with love." "That♪s an old rule."
