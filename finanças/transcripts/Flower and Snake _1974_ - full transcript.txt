Where is she? Let's have tea. Don't like it? l know a better place. -Mrs. Toyama often brought me here. -l see. Please. Thank you. Why did you come here? For dates. Pour for me. Here. Mrs. Toyama was ''bought'' by her husband. You know what l mean? He bought off her lover?. But she sometimes dated him here? Who is he? He's studying in the States. Shizuko has such a secret? lt's natural. Mr. Toyama is a worn-out pervert. Normal sexual stimulation can't give him an erection. He's abnormal. -You know all, don't you? -Yes.

Killed a man? Makoto, you're mine. Damn it! l can't! l can't! Shizuko. Shizuko. Knock first. l did. -Shut up! -Yes, sir. Hasn't Katagiri come? He hasn't even contacted us. Why not call him? Yes, right now, sir. l'll talk myself. Yes, sir. What? Yes. He's sick. Troublesome. Mother. -What is it? -Mr. Toyama wants Makoto. He wouldn't answer. Makoto, a call for you. Answer me! Makoto. Come on out. The boss is angry. You'll be fired. l don't mind. He knows what'll happen to Shizuko. l want to get out. No. Please. Just for a walk. Trying to run away? Silly. You know l can't get away from you. Hey. Say that you want an enema! -l want an enema! -Louder! l want an enema. Good. l want to go to the toilet. -Don't ask too much. -Please! Do it here. Please, Makoto. l can't stand it. Let me go to the toilet. Go. Wait here. ''Freedom.'' ''Bondage.'' ''Open.'' ''Please insert it now.'' ''l'm coming. l'm coming.'' No! l looked all over for you. My sandal broke. -How about a movie? -Pornographic? Wonderful! All right. Let's go. Let's go. Why? No fun. lt is. Let's go! Keep quiet. Jimmy. A lot... What are you doing? Damn it! Damn it! Screw you. l've got it! l didn't kill him! Shizuko! Makoto! Mother, l remember! l didn't kill that man. You did it. You stole his money too. You pretended as if l'd killed him. To get rid of the suspect. How terrible! l wasted my youth. Are you listening? What do you think Shizuko and l are doing now? We're screwing! We're having an orgasm! Listen. Can you hear? SHINJUKU POLICE STATION Shizuko. Makoto. Let's go home together. Don't go! l'm Toyama's wife. l'm satisfied with that. -You made me that way. -Liar! You love me! Leave him! What?

That's right. l am a devil. Do you still want to come with us? Hey. l've been transformed into a total slut, just as you wanted. Devil! Witch! -Don't go! -You can't take Makoto! Let's go home together! Don't go with her! Don't leave me! Get off me. Wait! Makoto! Makoto! Don't go! Makoto, don't go! Don't go! Come back to me. Makoto, come back to me. Makoto, don't go! Don't go! This way. -Welcome home, Madame. -l'm home. You've changed. Madame... Shizuko. Madame! Look. This is your ''goddess.'' Come closer. Take a good look. Haru. Madame! Are you happy? Yes... ...very. Makoto. Haru, look at me. Take a good look at me. What is it? You hit Mr. Toyama with rose thorns here. l feel as if it were long ago. Why do men exist? They're beasts!
