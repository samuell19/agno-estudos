- Hasn't the temperature come down? - Neither will it. "As long as his mother doesn't come back home, it never will" Why don't you bring her back? "By now, you very well know that your suspicion was invalid" She is innocent. "Listen to me, Colonel. It is pointless feeling sorry by yourself" "When you're at fault, ask her for her forgiveness and bring her back" "If not for yourself, then for your son, Mohan" You may not know how important it is for a child to have his mother. Only I know how difficult it is to bring up a child on my own. "Since my wife Kamala has died, my daughter has always been with me" "Moreover, most of the time I wonder" Who will take care of my child if I die. Let's go dear. Take her. Are you fine? Yes... That's right! "Then... Okay!" All right! Then? I had told him. Okay! So what? Okay! I'll definitely go. Where did Mohan go? My daughter... My Mona... Excuse me! I don't think you'd be needing this. Is my daughter playing with the doll? Her face is so small! Take this. Good day. Take this, my dear" To Jamuna" "Wherever you are, come back with my son at once" I seek your forgiveness for misunderstanding you. "I promise you that from now on, I shall never be rude to you" "Your husband, Colonel Mahendranath" "Mr. Rai, you very well know that I've raised Mona as my own child" "And now, she is the sole heir to all my properties and fortunes" "About your son, I have... Well, what's his name?" - Kunwar Biharilal. - Difu is his pet name. "If I have agreed to give my daughter to your son then... it's for these three conditions. "First of all, yours is a noble family" Secondly, he is well educated" And third and foremost quality that I want in him is good health. He's arriving from London tomorrow. You can see by yourself how he is. All right! I almost forgot! Do you know that today is the annual function of Vidya Bhuvan? "And Mona has challenged Miss Kamini, the student of Pandit Shammi Prasad" Who is the guru of classical dance to a dance competition. - Isn't that a remarkable thing to do? - It'll be a tough competition. "And if Mona succeeds in defeating Miss Kamini, in this competition" It sure will create a sensation all over Delhi. "When the guru doesn't stand a chance, what can be expected of his student?" - No doubt about it. - How true! "A flash of lightning... without clouds in the skies "The dot on her forehead sparkles" The dancing-bells chime "Look at the flash of lightning, without any clouds in the skies" "She's so beautiful, she possesses it all" "She's so beautiful, her charm pales the glitter of gold" "How will she stop? Her feet refuse to slow down "She displays her charm, she sways" As she casts a look "Look at the flash of lightning, without any clouds in the skies" "She steadies herself from every fall" "She has come alive like a huge flame" She's blazes a new trail... "and the world watches in amazement" "A flash of lightning... without clouds in the skies "The dot on her forehead sparkles" The dancing-bells chime "Look at the flash of lightning, without any clouds in the skies" "If your father had been alive now, his happiness" Would have known no bounds at the success of his daughter. "Uncle, today you seem to be very happy" "In that case, you should remember someone else too" Your wife and your son, Mohan" I shouldn't have said that. This topic always hurts you. "Well Difu, the son of Mr. Rai is arriving from London tomorrow" We have to go to receive him at the airport. "Uncle, is my presence required? Of course! He's to be married to you" "Now, take some rest and be ready tomorrow early in the morning" What is the matter? It's so late. Why hasn't he come in yet? - "Hello! - How are you, dear?" I apologize for my tardy arrival. Has the plane landed? "Surprisingly, it has arrived quite early today" - "Well, where's Difu? - He will be here any minute" Here is my dear darling son. "This is Colonel and his daughter, Mona, your would be bride" My son is a very funny boy. The press-photographers never leave me alone. Be it either a party or function; they pop up anywhere. - How right you are. - What are you doing? These photographers are very strange people. They follow you everywhere. - What happened to you? - Nothing. I had to go... to my dance practice. I am already late for it. Don't worry, I'll you there" "Today, we have a party at our place to celebrate Difu's arrival" - "You are cordially invited. - Mona, you come too" Or it will break my son's heart. You will come, won't you?" - What are you doing? - Nothing. "Come on, let's leave - Come on, Mr. Colonel" "Very good! Mona, today's rehearsal is worth watching" "This time, all the parties coming to Kashmir to participate" In the Youth festival will have to eat humble pie. Hardly a couple of days are left now. When do we leave? Well, what about the car?" "You know my uncle Colonel, don't you?" He detests the idea of us traveling to Kashmir by road. - What then? - He's agreed with much difficulty. He has rented the car from somewhere near Kashmir. - By when will it be here? - By tomorrow or the day after. - "But, I won't be accompanying you. - And, why's that?" - I am planning to commit suicide. - Why? Has your London returned groom brought along an English bride? Why would he be here if he could that? "So, he's finally here! How does he look?" - As like his name. - What do you mean? - You don't like him even a bit? - He is a complete idiot. I'd suggest that you'd better tell your uncle clearly... that you refuse to marry the boy. He hasn't practiced shooting for long now. He's quite longing for that. I don't understand how to get rid of this problem? Let's meet this character, Difu" How about today evening? They have held a party at their place. You ruined everything. "I had thought, you would come back as a civilized young man from London" - "But, all our efforts were in vain. - You schmuck!" What are you doing? At least think what the Colonel and Mona must be thinking about you. - What must they be thinking? - This is what you have to think. - What is to think? - What they must be thinking of you? - What must they be thinking? - You schmuck! - What are you doing? - You go down. I'll join you soon. Idiot! Mona has already arrived. You better get ready soon and join us. Remember one thing. No clowning around. Mona is a gold mine. Lose her and you have had it. I wish I was an orphan. Mind you! Do nothing to make uncle suspect me. He has been the army Colonel. He will court-martial me immediately. "Don't you worry yourself, dear. Leave everything to me" There he is. "Mona dear, here is your would Be husband. Enjoy yourself" Where do you think you are going? Have a seat. How about telling us about London? - "Well, let's hear about London. - Well" - Tell us. - Do tell us! - Why not tell us about London? - London! Excuse me! I'll be right back. - "But, how did this happen? - Go, ask that Colonel's daughter" Do you know that she deliberately pulled me and... - Couldn't you see? - Of course I could. I have already decided that I shan't marry that girl any more. I can find a much better girl. Girls go crazy on me. What a sample you have created. I've never felt so tempted to strangle him. Why blame me when you are equally at fault? How I feel like bashing you up! - Remember! Lose Mona and... - What? You are gone for good. - I get it! Leave him and let's go. I know everything. This is all your and your friends doing. You don't care for him just because he is a naive. - "Actually... - Mona, I've already given my word" "His son, Difu is your to-be-husband and it is your duty to respect him" Look at your daughter! I have fixed her marriage to the son of... the most renowned and wealthiest of families of Delhi. "And, she doesn't like. Would someone drop down from the sky" "Millions of beautiful girls in the journey through life" "Rose-like lips, intoxicating eyes... "but they still don't possess that which I seek" "Millions of beautiful girls in the journey through life" "Rose-like lips, intoxicating eyes... "but they still don't possess that which I seek" "Their tresses are a web of magic. " "They cast a spell on the heart with their ways" "Those eyes, they block my path" They're Cupid's arrows "Millions of beautiful girls in the journey through life" "Rose-like lips, intoxicating eyes... "but they still don't possess that which I seek" "I'm mad a heart. I don't know" "Who's the woman I dream of" "Under the cool shades of the trees" Were she to turn up... "how will I know she's the one? I don't even know her name" Whom do my desires seek? "Millions of beautiful girls in the journey through life" "Rose-like lips, intoxicating eyes... "but they still don't possess that which I seek" "At times, the beautiful one hovers around my heart" "In that case, we will surely meet up... "be it right here, or elsewhere" "Millions of beautiful girls in the journey through life" "Rose-like lips, intoxicating eyes... "but they still don't possess that which I seek" Home already? "Here's my first salary, Rs. 300. From now on, no stitching for you" - "really! - Yes. Now, I've stood on my feet" "On the arrival of Difu from London, at the Delhi airport is Mrs. Sarla" "Mr. Shankardayal Rai, Colonel Mahendranath" "Miss Mona and her proposed husband, Difu" You hate my father and yet you... purchase the magazine that publishes his photographs. Why? Can't blame you for he's quite a gentleman. "And, from his looks he doesn't look bad guy either" "Moreover, whenever I see him, I feel like" "You should go and meet him immediately, right!" Why don't you go then? You will get everything. From a pauper to a prince is what you will become. Mom, what are you saying?" Mom... "Perhaps, it is my fault. Seems, he will win in the end" "I promise you mom, I'll never leave you for him" "And, if I ever happen to ever come across him" I'll never let him know who I am. Kamala is here. Set the table. I'll join you in a minute. "Man, I've great news for you. You will be so pleased when you hear it" "Let's shake hands to it! But, I won't say it so easily" "First, let me bite onto something and only then will I speak" Is there some space yet left for more? - "Well, what was it? - I just thought, why not take" - You around the world? - How's that? A party from Delhi wants to come here by car. The deal has been fixed at Rs. 2500. Let's shake hands to it. I am leaving for Delhi today. Come along with me. We will have great fun. Let's shake hands to it. All right! Not a bad idea! - "But, I have a condition. - What is it?" "We'll definitely go to Delhi, but if you ask me to shake your hands" You will lose them both, get it!" - Is that all? - Yes. I agree to your condition. Let's shake hands to it. There you go again! You were just great! "Keep up the good work and soon, you will be making all over India" - You'll soon be the talk of the town. - And then? "Then, you will fly to London and Paris and the world over" And soon the whole world will say... - And then? - Then you will be married to Difu. And in a few years you'll have little ones prancing about in your backyard. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Why humor me when you can't help me out? How about calling Difu and telling him on his face... that you do not wish to marry him? "Because, you are nothing, but a schmuck" - "And, you think he'll agree to it? - My God, she is so dumb" aunt! Your Difu's mother is on the line. - "Hello aunt! - God bless you, dear" "The reason I called you up is that" Today Difu wishes to go on a picnic with you. He is on his way to pick you up. "Actually, I can't leave without my uncle's permission" Don't you worry about your uncle. I am calling from your place... and has already taken the permission from your uncle. "Well, shall I send him to you?" Not here. Send him over to the Coffee house. I'll meet him there. "Difu, go directly to the Coffee House. Mona will meet you there" How innocent he is? - The car has arrived from Kashmir. - Okay. "Gardener, have you brought me my lunch?- What?" Didn't I ask you to pack me some snacks? - "I forgot, sir. - What? Give my money back" I'll have to get it myself. I am so late! Mona must be waiting for me. Good morning, sir" - Are you the driver of this car? - Yes sir. - What is your name? - It's Kamala. "Well Kamala, you will get the advance tomorrow and the" - "Rest on reaching. - Thank you, Sir" It's been 10 years since I've been driving my cab in Kashmir. "My motto is, If I am the best then forget the rest" Let's shake hands to it! When is the party leaving for Kashmir? - Tomorrow morning. - Very good! That gives me one more day to see around Delhi. Let's shake... - Hello sir! - Who's he? He is my friend Mohan and he's with me. - What are you looking at? - You sir. - Will he also be going with you? - I might stay back if you wish. - "What kind of a man is he? - Actually, he is dazzled by" the flamboyance of this city. - Let's shake hands to it. - You both look crazy to me. - Good guess! - Shut up! Don't mind my friend... I don't like the looks of your friend. He shan't go with you. Do you know who will be traveling in your car? My daughter and her other respectable friends will be traveling. I too belong to a respectable family similar to yours. - How dare you! - You are like a father to me. - You may say as you wish. - you... - I'll be leaving! I'll be waiting for you in the Coffee house. Good day, sir" - Mind you! He won't go with you. - He won't. - He will have to go back by train. - He will. - "Go! Be back tomorrow. - Good day, sir" This is your return fare by train. - "Is this your friendship? - Yes, it is" - "You leave your friend for money! - Yes, I am" You Rascal; mean man; fatso. Dare if you call me fatso. What happened? - "Do you see that girl sitting over there in white? - Yes, I do" She is Mona; Colonel's foster child. She is to be married to Difu. - Who's he? - Look at his photograph. Is that princess going to be married to this clown? - Shouldn't they be married? - Not at all! So be it. There he is! This fellow is sure going to make my life a hell in this city. Hello madam! Are you here to meet Miss Mona? I am sorry, but she can't see you" I have been sent by the Colonel. I am his private secretary. "But, just a while ago, Mona spoke to my mom that she will meet me here" "Well, she had her fits right after that " - fits! - That's right! It's an old malady. "Tried every means to cure it, but it just won't give up" What kind of fits do you exactly mean by? "A dangerous one. Doesn't recognize anyone, tears up their clothes" "Last time, she hit the Colonel's head with an iron tongs" - Tongs! - That too of iron. - Where is Mona right now? - The Colonel has taken her to Agra. - To the Psychiatric Hospital. - To get her admitted? no! There is a doctor who puts on you... an iron helmet and that cures you completely. "That means, your Colonel wanted to marry his demented daughter to me!" They really took my parents for a ride! I am leaving for Agra right away... and I'll expose the father-daughter's devious scheme right there and then. Listen! - Are you expecting Difu? - Yes. - I thought so. - How do you know me? Difu had once shown your photograph to me back in London. - Are you his friend? - I've arrived from London today. Please have a seat. I remember quite well that Difu had mentioned you name to me. - "Well, what was it... - That's it!" "Actually, my full name is Mohanna, but I prefer Mona" - "What is your name? - Well, my full name is Mohan" And I prefer to be called Mohan. Has Difu also asked you to meet him in this place? no! I came down just today. When I called him up from my suite I learn that he had an attack again. - What? - He had fits.- FITS! Don't you know? This is why he went to London - for his treatment. "But, as it's hereditary, it's incurable" - "What kind of fits? - A very dangerous one, so to speak" Fails to recognize anyone; tears up his clothes. "The last time he'd fits, he knocked a London doctor with an iron tongs" - Tongs! - That too of iron. Who told you that he had suffered a seizure? "When I called up his place, his servant told me that" "He has suffered a terrible attack" He had to be strait-jacketed and driven off in an ambulance to Agra. - To get him admitted? - No. A doctor of the Psychiatric Hospital makes you wear an iron helmet. "He will be all right by evening. But, that sure jeopardized my trip here" - "How come? - Well, this is the first time" I have ever visited Delhi and that too for only a day. I am back to London by the morning flight. - Are you going back? - Yes. "I had planned to see Delhi with Difu. But, the poor fellow has taken ill" "Now, I just can't understand where will I go without any companion?" Could you tell me how far is the Red Fort from this place? Where exactly is the Qutub Minar? Heard that it's quite tall. - "Let me take you to all these places. - But, on one condition" You've to promise me to accompany me to the Psychiatric ward in Agra... and get me a snap of Difu wearing that iron helmet. - "And, why's that? - Don't ask me that. Great! She told us that she had an appointment with Difu... and here she is driving off with this handsome young man! Let's go! This is the famous Red Fort of Delhi. This was built by the Emperor Shahjehan. - Is that so? - Isn't it beautiful? - How true! You sure are right! Look how red it is! - Let's go. This is the Deewan-E-Khaas. - "And do you see that place over there? - Yes, I do" This was once the place of the famous Peacock throne. "really! You mean, the Peacock throne!" Let's go! This is the Qutub Minar. - my! It's so tall! - And so beautiful too. - No doubt about it. - Can't get your eyes off it? I sure can't. Do you know that this monument is 700 years old? But it looks so new. Have you come to see the historical places or... I am also interested in seeing some historical faces too. Come along with me then and I'll show you some. - What's wrong? - Let's check it out. Let me give you a can. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - My friends are here. - So what? God knows what they might assume if they see you here with me. - What will they assume? - They might spread all over... my college that I am having an affair with you. "Whereas, I have nothing to do with you" Is it my fault if we have nothing to do with each other? Better stay away from me as if we are total strangers. - What brings you all here? - Shall we leave then? - no! - It's good that you came. I just thought of having a stroll alone when I didn't meet Difu. - All alone? - That's right! - What is the meaning of this? - See it for yourself. - You are not that bad looking. - I am not that bad either. Well, we will see about that" - Someone has already seen it. - really! - "Then, what are you waiting for? - The minister is out on a vacation. That's great! He has got the brains. And the body too! Take a look at my biceps! "Wrestling's not my hobby, but I can take on any wrestler, one on one" - How long has this been going on? - Been years now. - That's a lie! Just this morning... - There! She agrees. - "So, she has brought you here! - She forced me to come here" - What for? - How about asking here that? Well, my dear" - What's there to be so angry about? - Because you're taking it all wrong. How about telling them the truth? My dear lady... "you are sometime a leaping flame, and some times a soothing song" Your ways... "how will I ever find words to praise?" "Your temper makes your eyes look red" "It's seen as one of your strong points... "for everyone else, it's a vice" "I have only looked at you... please believe me" My dear lady... "you are sometime a leaping flame, and some times a soothing song" Your ways... "how will I ever find words to praise?" "I wished to spend a few moments with you "I wished I could have a chat with you, without any reservations "You looked so beautiful and I wished" I stay with you forever My dear lady... "you are sometime a leaping flame, and some times a soothing song" Your ways... "how will I ever find words to praise?" - Now look what you have done. - good! Now we can talk in peace. The hell we will. "Excuse me, but where do you think you are going?" - Back to my house. - Don't you want to go to Agra? Never! I didn't know that you were this type of a man. What type am I? You're worried for no reason at all. I was only pulling their legs. - Now will you speak to me? - I don't wish to speak to you at all. I would have never gone with you to Agra... if I didn't need Difu's photograph so badly. What are you waiting for? Hop in if you want to. - Have I been forgiven? - Yes. "Now, just relax and I'll be right back" With Difu's photograph with his iron helmet. - "Stay back! - You stay back, crazy girl!" - You iron-clad man! - It's you with that iron helmet! - What happened? - Difu attacked me. I heard that he attacked the doctor and escaped. - He's become very dangerous now. - God! - Feeling nauseous! - my God! It's already 4... and we haven't eaten yet. Let's have some grub. Which is that place? Has that been built in the memory of a loved one? - I don't know. - Let's go and see. - Okay. Mad cap! - What did you say? - Oh! Nothing at all! The sun is setting. Yes! The sun is setting. It will soon be dark when the sun will set. "We'll return to Delhi. You'll go to your house and I, back to my hotel" "And tomorrow morning, when Mona will wake up, Mohan will have" Already left. Far and far away! Days, months, years" "And someday, on an evening Like this" "Mona will once again be standing here perhaps, with her love" Am I right? Adorn yourself with flowers... do your hair with stars... and when the sun is setting... do remember me, please" Adorn yourself with flowers... I came here like a stranger... "but I will leave, shorn of my senses "For this madman, do not blame yourself ever When the sun is setting... do sometimes remember me too "Should you have to tread an unknown path" "If ever there is a storm in your life... "do not consider yourself to be alone and shed tears" When the sun is setting... do think of me, too" Adorn yourself with flowers... do your hair with stars... - "Mona, has someone ever told you? - What?" That you are a very beautiful girl. - Shall I tell you something else? - What? Will you believe it? I can never forget you. "And, what about you? Will you forget me?" Here we met in the morning. And here we depart in the evening. - Which hotel are you staying in? - What will you do by knowing it? This is it then. Good bye. Thank's a lot. - Will you be going away tomorrow? - Yes. When will you be coming back then? Who will wait for me? Would you come back if someone looks forward to meeting you again? I'll leave everything and come back to her. "Then, someone will be surely wait for you" All her life. Let's shake hands to it. What happened? Dare if you come near me. Stay back! Stop or I'll throw this chair on you. - I'll break your head. - I'll make mincemeat out of you. - Crackpot! - You too! - What happened? - What's all this? - What is all this nonsense? - What is the matter? He is a total nut case. She is completely mad - What nonsense? - Ask the Colonel. His secretary has told me everything. Your London friend Mohan too has told me everything. You had gone there for your treatment... "and there, you smashed the doctor's head with an iron tongs" Was it me or you who smashed the Colonel's head with an iron tongs? - Shut up! - What are you doing? Today, you had taken her to Agra" You ran away from the asylum and now you are blaming me! Silence! What's all this nonsense? - Have you both lost your mind? - Allow me to tell you everything. - Me first. - Speak up. "Today morning, I had gone over to the Coffee house to meet her" There I met your secretary whom you sent to me. - What secretary is he talking about? - How would I know? Ask him. What have you thought about it? You'll be a millionaire in a jiffy. It's obvious that you too will have a share of it. Perhaps you don't know that you are a mere spectator in this game. "And, it's me who's risking my neck" Your neck was already on the line. Photography is one of my hobbies. "Till today, the police is searching for Laxmi's murderer" "And if you wish, the search could go on" "If you value your life, don't even think of getting rid of me" The negative of this print is kept in a very safe place. It will immediately be handed over to the cops as soon as I die. "Khanna, what happened? Did you find anything?" Nothing yet. Can't say who that young man was with Mona. "Well Mr. Ramesh, let's decide our future strategy" Have a seat if we are in business. - "Have you taken everything? - Yes, I have" - Is he too coming along? - Yes. Speak softly else he'll hear. What's wrong with you? Why are you so depressed? - It's nothing. - Listen to me. "If you don't like Difu then, you needn't marry him" - Happy now! - uncle! Let's go. "Get in, dear. The car is leaving!" There's no room. Get in at the back. Let's go! - Why did you stop the car? - I am lighting up my beedi. Drive on, will you?" - How much is it? - Twenty thousand. "He is my friend, Subodh Mukherji and he will accompany you" He'll contact me as soon as all the arrangements been made in Kashmir. I'll then begin with the procedure as soon as I get all the report. "So you finally hit me, you nut case!" - What happened? - She hit me. "Mona, why don't you say what happened?" - He was here right now. - Who's he? "He... Well" - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - Forgive her. She is just a child. That reason won't muster. That was just too rude of her. "Hurry up, will you? Get me the chicken. I am famished" Excuse me! - "What happened? - He asks ""What's done you""?" Say what? Shut up. Excuse me again! The food is over. You won't get any more. Please have a seat. Make yourself comfortable. - Why don't you eat? - Yes sure! - "Isn't it tasty? - Yes, very much" Hope it's not that spicy. Why don't you tell us what you are eating? I am talking to you. Tell us what you are eating. "God knows what this is, but it sure is very tasty" We will find it right now. Say what. - What do you mean? - This is knows as a 'Gupat' seed. And ten seeds of it is equivalent to a peg of whiskey. God! No wonder I am feeling so giddy. - Who asked you to eat this? - Mona did. Is she too eating this? "She already has and by now, she must be sloshed" A picture of you can't soothe my aching heart... Where are you off to now? She just won't listen to us. Whose photograph is it? One look of him will make your heart skip a beat. really? Let's have a look at it then. no! No way! "From my eyes, to my heart" "Travels the image of an unknown man" The flame itself seeks the moth... he's an incomparable man "That smile on his lips" "And the twinkle of mischief in his eyes" "The scent of passion in his breath" And the love in the way he spoke My world... had changed "Like a cloud, he vanished" "such was the spell he cast with his eyes" I seek him on my own... he is incomparable The way he arrives He arrived as silently... as Spring "We spent only a few moments together" "But it seemed as if I had spent a lifetime with him" Without him... I shall not live "I wish I could get to know about him" Have you got everything? "Don't blow the horn. Come, lets all call together" Difu... Come soon! Hurry up! We are leaving! "Come soon else, we will leave you behind!" - Why have you stopped again? - I'm lighting my beedi Hurry up, you idiot!" - Where are you going? - Going...? I'm going to tell the manager that I'll be joining duty from tomorrow. - "Don't be very late, my son. - I'll be back in a jiffy" Adorn yourself with flowers... do your hair up with stars. When the sun is setting... Do remember me too. I came here like a stranger... - So you've been with us all the way? - Right. - And where were you? - On the roof of the car. - Didn't you go to London then? - London... - "Actually, Mona... - Think of another lie. "I know you're angry with me, because I'm not what I claimed to be" But I'm a far better man. I'll tell you the whole truth about myself... Who wants to know who you are and what your truth is. You may think I've really fallen in love with you. That I've been pining and crying for you. Wrong! Absolutely wrong! Whatever I did was my childishness. - I don't care for you. - It's no good. - What's no good? - Your attempt at lying. - You are proud of your looks? - Sure. Have you ever seen your face in the mirror? I did. And the mirror cracked. - What is it? - Won't you forgive me? No. - You aren't mine then? - No. - Won't you ever change your mind? - No. So return my coat. It's pure wool No! I'll teach you a lesson today. I'll break your bones! So what did you mean by that insolence? Speak. Wait. I forgive you. Don't do that ever again. - "What are you doing? - Cooling his passions, that's what?" - Aren't you going out? - No. My word! What's your problem? He won't come here ever again thinking I spilt that water on him. - Girls... hear what? - What? He's not coming here again! "Silly girl, that guy has been around right from this morning" Wait... you'll ruin the game. My apple's the sweetest. Let's go. It's getting crowded here. - "Let's go and play, Mona. - No. I'm not feeling like it" - So what do you feel like doing? - Let's go some place. - "Some place you can meet him? - No, I mean" Let's go to Baramullah. In a horse-cart. It's great fun. - "What have you done? Pick it up. - Pick it up yourself, sir" My horse might be offended. Social-workers! A ruffian has run away with my fiancee. Please follow him. - What happened? - It isn't starting up. No? Is it social-service or a fraud? Hurry up! "Get a hold on your heart, my dear lady" "I come back to you as your love" "For you, my dear lady, I bring my heart again" I'm the one whose pining... brings the glow to your face. "I'm the one who makes your lips look redder" "May your tresses like chains. "May you be even more beautiful" "My heart reflects my love, it's a gift of love" "I bring my heart to you once again" "How will you ever escape my roving eyes, my love?" "Everyplace you set foot, you will find my heart" How dare I remain away from you?" "How can I even think of going away elsewhere?" "I sure have a heart, I bring you a gift of love... "I bring my heart to you once again" Get the jeep out! - "But what bring you here so suddenly? - Actually" "Uncle, do you know that I won the dance competition?" really! Let me give too you a good news. - "I have found my son. - Your son, Mohan!" "Well, he is now known as Ramesh and not Mohan" I am told that my wife Jamuna had changed his name in his childhood. - "Well, did you meet him? - I will go in the morning" "But, it shouldn't be revealed to him that I am his father" - Why's that? - I'll explain it to you later. "And now, you too give me your word that" You will never tell him or anyone about the truth. - I give you my word. - That's like a good girl! "Now, you and Difu and all your friends come with me" I have rented a bungalow. Why not all of us stay together? As you please. Come this way. Please open the door. Please open the door. "Do you know, the locket he's wearing was given to him in his childhood?" - "Is that so? - Ramesh, why don't you open the door?" - "What are you doing, boy? - GO AWAY" - "Doctor, what's wrong with him? - What are you doing?" "Looks like, he's lost his mind. I am afraid he might hurt himself" - "Ramesh, open the door! - Go away" STOP! Bravo! What a fine job you are doing. Your mother's spirit will be greatly pleased to see you this way. The spirit of your mother is always with you... and watching over you and every activities of yours. Is this the way to keep her memories alive? Whose parent's live forever? Everyone has to bear this cruel sorrow of the cycle of life. Look at me. I too have lost my parents. I have been fostered by a person who wasn't even related to me. "But today, he means more to me than my own parents" I call him Uncle. Would you like to meet him? He will definitely help you to overcome your grief. Let me help you with your clothes. Where are your clothes? - Congratulations! - Thanks a lot. My dear, you were just great!" "Uncle, I think that this is not the right time for you to meet him" I suggest you go home. I'll get him. Let him settle down further. Let's go home & wait for him. Come. Mr. Ramesh, this is my Uncle" - "Welcome son. - Mr. Ramesh, shake hands with him" - Let's go inside and talk. - Go! Mona, who's he?" "Well, he is the son of a dear friend of my uncle" Wait here for me and I'll be right back. I have seen him with my very own eyes! He is here! - really! - He and his family! His foster daughter Mona brought along a young man in her car. "It wasn't Difu, but some other good looking man" I don't wish to live here anymore. We will go away some place else. - Why? - I definitely see trouble coming. - What if he comes to know about us? - Nothing will happen. - He can cause us no harm. - I am so scared! God only knows what will happen. A good looking man! "And, when your wife was breathing her last" With much effort did she opened her eyes and looked at Ramesh. Then she handed him a cut photograph of a magazine. And told him that you don't know her. She is to be your wife. "Go to Delhi after I am gone and... And then, she said no more" Do you know: whose photograph it was? "That was of your daughter, Mona. Are you telling me the truth?" "Yes. Then, Jamuna's last wish" Will be fulfilled. Uncle! Today we are really tired after much sightseeing. really! Have a seat please. "The doctor has told me just now that" Your mother's last wish was to open up an Orphanage. I have transferred one million rupees from Delhi today. You may set up an Orphanage named after your mother... right after the transaction takes place. - Are you telling me the truth? - Of course! Colonel, this is amazing!" "Do you know, this is the first time he has spoken after so many months?" - God be praised! - How true! I shall make a move then. Wait! Let me leave you to your car. Where do you think you are going? You cannot go home as long as you are not completely well. Sit down. Let me set the table for you. Where had you gone? Where had you taken Mona? "I think, the Colonel wants to marry off Mona it" Where are you off to all dressed up so early in the morning? Do you see that mountain over there? It snowed on that mountain today. "And by chance, I happened to meet a dear girl-friend of mine" Back from my college days. Her name is Chanchal Rani and I have an appointment with her. Won't you be meeting Mona? I am busy today. Perhaps some other day. "So, this guy has a rendezvous with" Miss Muffet instead of Miss Congeniality. Let me inform about this to the poor girl right away. Do not go away... with the peace of my heart... "lest someone robs you of my love" "Whatever the distance, you are always with me" "The silence of this evening stands testimony" "O proud one, you do make beautiful promises "And where is it that you plan to go?" "You turn away your face, tossing your hair" Why these distances? "My love, do not take love to be a mere game" "You will someday remember how much I loved you" "You are the one who lingers in my heart and my eyes" "At least today, you must show faith in my love" "For all the love I have for you" You have no affection for me "My love, do not take love to be a mere game" "You will someday remember how much I loved you" "You are my only companion. However" "There is also a stranger who walks in step" "Not without reason do I have a predicament" I swear it on my tormented heart "My love, do not take love to be a mere game" "You will someday remember how much I loved you" "My love, do not take love to be a mere game" "You will someday remember how much I loved you" - "Excuse me! - What is the matter, sir?" The young man who had accompanied you to Delhi; where does he live? He lives in the cottage on the mountain near the 5th bridge. What do you want him for? - Excuse me! Did Ramesh come by? - No sir. Go to Dr. Subodh Mukherji immediately... and ask him if Ramesh has come there. Hurry up now. - Go now. - Where will you meet me tomorrow? Near the lake. - All right then. - Go now! Hello sir. Please come inside. I knew that you would definitely come. "And, you also knew that I'd bring along my cheque-book" Or rather, cash" "I sure am surprised at your blatancy. But, can't blame you for it" It's in your blood. "To tell you the truth, your blood; my blood; it's all the same" Had the situation been different you would had been answered differently. But I know that you have worked your charm on Mona too well. "And now, I'll have pay for her credulous mistake" - How much do you want? - How much can you spare? - "Ten, twenty...;twenty-five thousand! - Is that all!" - FIFTY THOUSAND! - Is that all! Don't go too that I would change my mind. Take this. Wow! This is something! "I have lighted many a cigarettes in my life" But never before with a fifty thousand rupees cheque. "I know exactly what will suffice you, but remember this!" You shall never succeed in your treacherous attempts. I bet you. "From tomorrow on, Mona will avoid you and despise you" "And if not then, neither I nor Mona nor you shall live" "Mohan, what's all this going on? What have you got to do with Mona?" - Why don't you tell me? - You have heard everything. God! What will happen now? "Nothing will happen now, mom. Why are you worrying?" You are in love with Mona and he is now your arch enemy. God! What is all this going on? - Something terrible has happened. - What happened? Ramesh had jumped into the river. We saved him with much difficulty. Sister! Take him to his room And change his clothes. I have given him the sedation. Let no one disturb him till morning. "Doctor, how's he feeling now? How did this happen?" He will do it again. "And this time, nobody will be able to save him" He'll discard this wretched life & seek refuge in the hands of death. Whatever was the need for you to come into his life. But no! He was born to suffer at the hands of his father. He was born to suffer the life of poverty. He was born to see in his youth... his blooming happiness being crushed. "After the death of his mother, he saw, but one ray of hope" "But now, he knows that there is nobody for him now" "And all because, your foster daughter is in love with someone else" "Believe me, happiness has eluded your son since the day of his birth" "And today, life has become a burden for him" "Every moment is a bad dream for him. And every breath, agonizing" There's only one way to save him from the anguish. If you truly have a father's heart; I suggest that you strangle... your son tonight with your very hands... Death would be a relief for. If you truly have a father's heart; I suggest that you strangle... your son tonight with your very hands... Death would be a relief for him. - U N C I E! NO... - Move aside! - "Uncle no... - I say, move aside!" You can't kill him! I'll do exactly as you say. I promise that I will never meet him again. I'll take you out. I'll always be with you from now on. I'll never leave you alone. "Let me get you your clothes and then, we will go for a walk" - Let go of my hand! - I wish to have a word with you. I am not interested. Let go of me now. "You can't leave without hearing to what I have to say, get it!" Let go of me! Stop! You can't hit him. What's all this going on? Beat him up! "Stop! Uncle, ask them to stop!" Somebody get some water. Let the air come by. Mohan! What happened to him? Some people were beating him up. They ran away now. Tell me and I'll crush them all! We don't know who they were. - At least tell me who they were! - We don't know! - Where are you going? - To tell your father who you are. - "And, for what reason? - I can't see you suffer like this" Today, I give up!" "Today, I'll go and tell him about your true identity" I'll beg him for your happiness. Do you take your son to be so mean and such a scum... to accept his alms willingly? Never! What do I do then? Do you want me to watch you suffer like this? Let's do one thing. "Tomorrow morning, I'll take you to my humble cottage in my village" Spend some days there and everything will be okay. What do you say? We will leave this place tomorrow morning; definitely. - Who was it? - No one. What do you say? Your entire job will be over within 3 hours. "We will have a million rupees and then" - "We will get a 50-50 cut. - But, I want Mohanna" You know that you can't stay here... - nor can you marry Mona. - I want Mohanna. Jamuna is alive and Mohan and Mona are in love with each other. Your true identity can't be kept a secret for long. You heard what I just said. I want Mona. "You can hide the money, but not Mona" "After we cross the border, you take care of money" - And I will take care of Mona. - But where will you take her? - "To hell or take to themountains. - All your life! - Yes, all my life" Have you gone mad? For a woman... "There can be bloodshed, A king can be overthrown" What am I? "This could be my youthful caprice. But, this is just beyond your ken" Go. I'll get Mona tomorrow. I wish to speak with you. Tell me what my position is. What's so funny? Do you think I have cracked a joke? "Listen, you are a good boy, and Mona is not worthy of you" I am telling you the truth. I suggest you get married to a very nice girl. I'll bear all the expenses so that you have a grand wedding. And I also promise to finance you so you may set up your own business. All right then. I repeat. I have a sweetheart back in London whose name is Miss Keelar. Don't you read the papers? "But the problem is, my fat mother & my funny father" Wants me to get married to Mona. - "Well I... - I get your point" - If only you hadn't been such an ass. - Ass! I would have never changed my plans of your marriage to Mona. But, I like your eccentricity" "In that case, accept this cheque of a hundred thousand rupees" my God! A hundred thousand rupees! I'll go mad with glee. "For the Orphanage, one million has come from Delhi" You may begin with your project whenever you wish. "But before that, I want to fulfill my wish" I've called the priest to decide the date of your engagement Everything will be fixed today. You may go for a walk now. Kamala had told me that he would be here by 11. "From my eyes, it travels to my heart... "is the image of a man I do not know "He's like the moth the lamp itself seeks... such is the magic he wields "From my eyes, it travels to my heart... Excuse me! Could you please fetch me the musical instrument from the car? Excuse me! I want to tell you something. You shameless girl! "You would not have doubt in my love" Had you knew my helplessness "You have seen how difficult one can be But you have not seen someone suffering in one's pain" "I wished to say something to you" "But my love did not let me to do so" "To who should I express my sorrows "To who should I express the agony of the heart" "You have seen how difficult one can be But you have not seen someone suffering from one's pain" - Any other baggage? - No more. - Where is Mohan? - He was out since morning. He has gone to change. He will join us soon. I might lose the keys to my village house if I keep them with myself. I want you to keep them with you. - "Shall we leave? - Yes. Let's go, aunt" Mohan has left his house. The coast is clear. Finish your job quickly. Act fast! - Father! - What happened? - They have abducted Mona. - Who has? Some men; came in a car; beat me up a lot. The left this note. Mona's life will be decided in 2 hours. Informing the police will be futile. If you wish to save Mona's life;... come to the pillar near the Dal lake. You will find a red cloth tied to the pillar... and a red boat waiting for you in the waters. Sail in the boat and come to Char Chinaar. Mona will be handed over to you when you reach there. Pay the ransom of one million and release Mona. I very well know who's behind this. "Father, do anything, but bring me back my Mona" "Don't you worry, son. I am going to the bank to get the money" "But before that, I have to pay a visit to someone" - Whose house? - Mohan's house. - The keys has to be on the cot. - All right. Stop right there! Hand over Mona to be right now if you wish to live. Tell me where Mona is. - You come here to search for Mona? - Yes "Because, this ransom letter has been written by you " "But, it is not that easy to deceive me" "Tell me where Mona is else, I'll shoot!" - TELL ME! Tell me or else... - S T O P! First shoot me if at all you wish to shoot. "You've already taken away all my joys; Now, he is all I have" Take him away too. Go ahead and kill him! "But before you do that, finish me off too" Kill me! I no longer wish to live anymore! I know I was too cruel to you. I am your culprit. "And perhaps, I can only make amends of my mistake by my life" Please forgive me if you can. - "Let's go and get Mona. - Yes, let's go" - "Kamala, you stay with mom. - Okay" Wait! I too will come along with you. Come! Let me lessen your burden. Perhaps you may not know that someone else too can take your life from here. Tell me where Mona is! Quick! Start the motor-boat! Subodh! Get Mona at once! Let go of me! HELP! Uncle! Stop! Don't worry about me! They have sailed off with my daughter. Go and help my Mona. Help my child! "Take him to the doctor immediately. Abdullah, inform the police at once!" Hey, clear the path!" Let me have the revolver. Stop it! Aren't you ashamed? It's three against one! I alone can take on all three of them. You stay out of this. Dare if anyone aided him! Let him die there. - Please save him! - Save him! My foot! No way! Fight like a man! "Bravo! You sure are something, man!"
