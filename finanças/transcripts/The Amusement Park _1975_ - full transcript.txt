- Hello there. My name is Lincoln Maazel. On my next birthday, I'll be 71 years of age. I am an actor, I'm working. I have a family. Despite the many problems and frustrations of the world as it is today, no one will deny that there is still a basic fulfillment which is drawn from living, being active, and contributing. There is a joy to life available to those who can interact with nature, with their fellow man. Unfortunately, this interaction is denied to many groups, for many reasons. Levels of income, environmental deprivation, geographical accident, perhaps the saddest cause of denial and rejection is very simply, old age. Man lives his mature life with hope. He looks forward to the day when he can reap the benefits of his experience, his earnings and his wisdom. And yet, he often finds he is not regarded as a productive member of his society. And if he doesn't have a reputation and doesn't have financial substance, the situation is a hundred times worse. Some of the many problems of aging are loneliness, failing health, inadequate transportation, inadequate medical care, inadequate housing, lack of money, improper nutrition, and perhaps most acute, the lack of compassion and supportive services from the younger members of our society. The oldest citizens of the world represent a much misused natural resource. The wasting of this great resource is a worldwide tragedy, but this can be corrected by people. People who can be made aware. People who can care and who can respond to the need. Oh, you've heard the statistics, and you've been preached to about the problem. You've seen news reports and documentary material dealing with the plight of the elderly. We will not repeat what you have heard. The amusement park which you are about to visit illustrates some of the many problems people of my age face on a daily basis. We intend for you to feel the problem, to experience it, and we ask for your sympathy as you watch. And when the film ends, we hope you will have the concerned interest to take action. The supporting players of this film are not actors. They are volunteers, many of whom are actively involved in services to the elderly. The older people in the film are also volunteers who are either concerned enough to give us of that time or who, in real life, are living in institutions, in lower income housing areas, or in city slums. The time spent in shooting at Westview Park, which facility was donated to the production, was for some of the elderly players, the only enjoyable time they have had in recent years. Remember, as you watch the film, one day you will be old. - Hello? I say hello there. Don't you care to talk? - No. - Uh, tell me, um, would you like to do something? - No. - Do you, um, do you ever go outside? - No. - Don't you want to ever go outside? - Th-there's nothing, nothing out, outside. - Well, I'm going outside anyway. - You, you won't, you won't like, you won't like it. - Well I'll, I'll see for myself if you don't mind. Goodbye. - Th-there's nothing outside. Nothing. Nothing. I can't give you more than $5 for it. - Oh no, they're worth more than that. No, I'm afraid not, ma'am. - Oh, please. - They may have sentimental value to me but they're worth $5 to me and that's it. Take it or leave it. All right then. Okay, thank you. - This is silver. - All right, let me take a look at it. That's real silver. - I can't give you more than $5. - Oh man, what you talking about, listen. $5, take it or leave it. You ain't looked at the thing right. Not worth anything more than $5. I've examined it very thoroughly. - Well come on, come on I'll take it, but you are, you are beating me now. There you are. - How much you give me for it? - I'll give you a buck. - No, you can't, $15. - What, take a buck, that's it. - Oh my goodness. - Who's next? Yes sir? - I'd like to get some tickets. - Okay, fine. Cash, that's what I like to see. How much you have to spend? - Well, I. - Time is money, let's come on now. - I'm, I'm on a budget, you see? I have to be very careful. - How much do you want to spend? - Well, I. - Just a minute folks, I'll be with you in a second. - I can afford about half. - Half, all right, fine, fine, fine. - And this is gonna be for an emergency. - Sure, okay. That's okay with me. Sure okay, here you go. - Thank you very much, sir. - Who's next? Step right up. - Okay, it's fine. - Oh! - Oh! Why don't you watch where you're going? - I'm terribly sorry. I'm terribly sorry, I, I. - Okay, step right across. Here, that's fine, go ahead, here. One more, watch your step there, watch your step. Two, take two more here. Hurry up, you're gonna miss the car. Okay, good. Sorry ma'am, you're not aloud. Read the sign there. Let's go, come on, next, next. Fine, fine. I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't get on. - Oh please, please. - Read the sign, just read the sign. - How come we can't get on? Maybe next year. - How come we can't get on? Go right through there? How come we can't get on? We're going down! We're going down! We keep going downhill. No we're going up, we're going up! All aboard! All aboard! Okay! - Read the chart. Start at the top, just work your way down. - E-F, C. Z. D. All right, you be calm, Harry, take it easy. - T. - Okay, ma'am, you're okay. But, sir, you're gonna have to be a passenger from now on. Cannot renew your license with those eyes. Hurry, hurry, hurry! - See where you're going for crying out loud. If there's anything stupider than a woman driver, it's an old woman driver. - What do you mean? You made left hand turn with a right hand signal. - How old are you? - Well, if it's any of your business, I'm 67. - If that's true you shouldn't even be allowed on the road. Anybody over 65 should be made to ride the bus. - What do you mean? Don't you know, your left hand from your right? Ah, you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, one minute. What happened? She hit me from behind. - Well, for goodness sake. My version is, he doesn't know his left hand from his right hand. Your driver's license, please. She hit me from behind. Now isn't it true when somebody hits you from behind it's their fault? Right in front of your eyes? - Okay listen, that's why I'm here. - Since I'm so old, you better have a little more respect for me. That's what I say. - There's no sense arguing about it. I'll make the report of what I see. - Oh, here's our insurance man. You can see the damage, you know how much something like this costs. You're not even old enough to be an insurance guy. - We're here to represent our client. A kid in kindergarten knows left and right hand. - Officer, excuse me please, but I was driving coming this way and I saw the accident. This man actually made a left hand signal and made a right turn. I saw him do that. Aw, come on. Exactly, good. - Well, sir, all I can tell you is the same thing I told them, since I didn't see the accident, I'll be glad to put down what you said and your name and address, the insurance companies will contact you. Can I see your drivers license, please? - Yes. I would guess that our company's gonna require a slight adjustment in the rate. - Good grief, man. We can hardly afford it now, the rates are high enough. - Don't you worry, Harry. We're not gonna have any rate increase 'cause this was not our fault. - According to your license, you're supposed to be wearing eyeglasses. - Oh, yes, well. Do you? - I, I, I have them. Aha, aha. Oh, what? Blind man, blind man says he saw the accident. Oh my goodness, Harry. I'd like to see this hold up in court. He didn't have his glasses on. How could he be a witness to anything? I'm telling you, I made a signal. She smashed into me from behind. That's all there is to it. You made a signal, all right. Clearly, you're wrong. Look at this damage. Gonna have to have a new paint job. Look I'm gonna tell you something. I've had about enough of both of you arguing. I'm not gonna tell you again. I got my own insurance man. I'll take care of this myself. Hurry, hurry, hurry! - Hey, you! What are you, some kind of a degenerate? What are you doing with those kids? I'll give you about two seconds to get out of here! Hurry, hurry, hurry! You enjoy, you enjoy. Oh no, it's fun, you'll like it. - I'm not sure that I want to go in here. You'll really like it. Get back in there. - You're supposed to have fun in there, You gotta have fun in there. Hey buddy, come here. - Ah, two young lovers. You want to fortune told? - We want to see what life is gonna be like. - What part of life? - When we get old. - Are you sure? - Yeah, we want to know if we're still going to be together. - Well, there are conditions. You must see it all, is that agreed? - Yeah. You must see it all. All the way to the end. - Sure. - Look into the future then. Into the magic ball. Into the future, into the future, into the future. - I'm Alan Ross with Mr John Wilson, the landlord here who owns the building. Mr Wilson, why haven't you made any repairs to this building? It's in deplorable condition. - Well sir, do you realize the kind of taxes that we have to pay here? But aren't the conditions here unsafe for the people who pay you rent, good money? Well, actually rent that I get is no more than about $10 a week from these people. And with that kind of money, do you expect me to make any more improvements than what we have already? Well if you can't make the repairs yourself, Mr Wilson, then why don't you sell this property and let someone else make them? Well, we tried desperately to do that, but who will buy it? Would you, sir, would you consider buying this property? I'm asking you the question. I'm asking the question of you, Mr Wilson. You tell me why you can't sell it. Well, not too many people today would take the chance to buying this kind of property knowing the circumstances and the conditions here. Seems the condition is that you haven't made any improvements. You're telling me you don't have the money. Yes. What about the condition inside? Don't you have an obligation to your tenants to make these repairs and make them now? We have made some repairs, but unfortunately they're the type of people that just will not take care of themselves nor the place that they're living in. - Well you look better than my mother looked. You look wonderful. - Oh, hello there. - Dr Jones, my husband is so bad. I can't talk to him, he won't answer me. He doesn't take his medicine. - I'd love to talk for a longer period of time. - You're too busy to come. - Goodbye. Could you explain to our audience if someone in this building is burned to death tonight or be injured in a fall down these decrepit stairways, how would you explain it, sir? - Sir, I sincerely hope that never happens. - I can't understand. I can't get him to even recognize me. Why can't you come to come to see my husband? We've always been good patients. As poor as we are we've always paid our bill. Why are you punishing me like this? For heaven's sake, didn't you take an oath when you studied medicine that you would be kind to people? Isn't that one of the things a doctor's supposed to do? What kind of a man are you? I want you to come here. Would you, please? - Doctor, I have a ringing in my ear. - Well then, God help you if you have to have this on your conscience! Mister, please, mister. Oh my God, mister, please. Can you give me a dime, I have to make a telephone call. Oh, why are people so mean? Why can't anybody help me? - Tickets, man, dig, dig, dig. Pick him, pick him. Tickets, tickets, man. No, no, come here, man. Go through his pockets, go through his pockets. What you got, what you got? Hey give me, give me some of those tickets. His tickets, man. Give me some of that. Wow! Your name, sir? - I, I. Your name, sir. - I, I, I have no receipt. I can't. I've got insurance. - That's an awful lot of paperwork. Can't you pay cash? - Cash, yeah I, I uh, I got some cash. - Get in there. - Looks like a bandage. Bandage, bandage here. Bandage. - Bandage? Bandage. Bandage. Move down the line. This looks like a bandage. - Bandage? Move down the line. - I need more. I more than a bandage. - Bandage? - Bandage. I need more than a bandage. Move down the line please, sir. - Did you have your forms filled out, sir. - I don't have any forms. You don't have any? - No. We need your forms. - I don't have any. Oh come on sir, you'll have to go back to the beginning of the line. - I need a doctor. - We need our forms. Look, you should be feeling a lot better, they put a bandaid on you. Take this and just go back to the beginning. - Go back? Yes, we need our forms, sir. Go back. - Bandage. - Bandage. I need more than a bandage. - Low cost of installation, low heating process. Something you've always dreamt of in a perfect climate. - As I've walked down the road of life, one thing's been true to me, and that is that a man's home is his castle. Now home is just like the body. That home gets old, it gets weak, it gets tired. Now there are many things that can happen to a home. The roof can leak, gas, fire. All the devils of the night can sneak in and wipe out your investment all at once. Now ladies and gentlemen, my father and I many years ago decided that man's home being his castle, we formed Castle Rebuilding. And we've been rebuilding castles around this area for a long, long time. Saving the life investment of many and many a person. Big five, big public space. Ma'am, let me show you that just one moment please. A place to live, a place to live with nice big roomy houses. Ma'am are you tired of watering your grass? Are you tired or watering your plants? Are you tired of painting your house, sir? You're darn right, you are. Well I've got something. - I am now gonna come on Monday. And for those of you who are willing, I am gonna give you my card. Castle Rebuilders, founded by my father and myself. - We'll accept your home in a trade in at a very fair market value. In fact, you can have your home independently appraised, let us know what it is, our appraisers will check it out, and if that's a fair market value you can trade your home in for one of these retirement, carefree homes. - We make an estimate absolutely free of charge. Never do we charge one penny for inspecting your furnace, for inspecting your roof, for inspecting your electric wiring. - What you have to do is watch out for these fast talkers. What one really needs is a friend. - Oh, yes, sir, you're quite right, quite right. - I think this is about the best place to find a friend. Round an amusement park. - Yes, it is a beautiful place. - It's a beautiful place, you're right. And I want to thank you for taking a few minutes to talk with me and I'll see you later. God bless you. 85% of a man's savings is wrapped up in just one single possession, his home. Do you spend a lot of time fixing your home, sir? Yes, I do. Do you find that things go wrong? Yes, I do. Do you find it that it makes you tired? Do you find it makes you sick? Do you find it makes you say, I wish this home would stop breaking down. But when do I have to pay you? You don't have to pay me, sir. - Hurry, hurry, hurry! The big show is just about to begin. Step right up here, young man. Tickets are 25 cents each. Hurry, hurry, hurry! The freak show is just about ready to begin. The biggest show on the lot, oh wait, your change. Here's your change, thank you. Hurry, hurry, hurry, the freak show is just about ready to begin. Hurry, get your ticket. There's your ticket, there's your ticket. Thank you very much. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Come on, start the show! Yeah! Come on! - Oh, what a waste! What a waste! - Hey, one of them's getting away! Get him! Get him! Get him! Don't let him get away! - I'm so tired. It's so nice to find a nice little girl. Oh, what a lovely book. Would you like me to read the story to you? Would you? Oh, I would like to very much. Let's see. Oh, this is "The Three Little Pigs." Once upon a time, three little pigs went out into the world to seek their fortunes. - Want some chicken? - Oh, I'd love to have a piece of chicken. I haven't had anything to eat for some time. Well, thank you, dear. Wouldn't you like to have a piece, too? - No thanks, I already had some. - Now the first thing each of them had to do was to build a house to live in. The first little pig met a man carrying a bundle of straw. Please, sir, he said. Give me some straw to build myself a house. The straw house was quickly built, and the little pig was just settling down nicely when a big, bad wolf knocked in the door and said, little pig, little pig, let me come in. Not by the hair on my chimney chin chin, said the little pig. Isn't that funny? Then the big, bad wolf, uh, huffed and he puffed. And he puffed and he huffed and blew the house in. He ate up the frightened little pig and that was the end of that little pig. Girls, come on now, it's time to go. - Now the little pig had built himself a house of bricks. It took him much longer to build a house, a straw house and a house of sticks, the little pig that just got to the brick place. When the big, bad wolf knocked the door and said, little pig, little pig, let me come in! And not by the hair of my chimney chin, chin. Hi there.

Nothing out there. - Well, I'm, I'm going outside. - You won't like it. - Well, if you don't mind, I'll see for myself. Goodbye. - There's nothing out there. Just nothing. Nothing. Just nothing. - One of these times, the door will open in your life and you will step into the amusement park. Full of hope, anticipation for the future, and curiosity for what you will find there. And whether you return to the white room, desolate, destroyed, and without any hope for the future, will depend on a number of factors, which when the time comes, will be beyond your control. In anticipation for that day, consider now that the man in the amusement park is a mirror image of yourself, separated only by the passage of time. Consider taking some positive action while you are young enough to be a positive influence. It should be obvious to all of you that the amusement park need not to end in a sterile white room. You can help. If you have been moved to action, there are a number of programs already established, which enable concerned persons to offer volunteer services to the elderly. Thank you for watching. I'll see you in the park someday.
