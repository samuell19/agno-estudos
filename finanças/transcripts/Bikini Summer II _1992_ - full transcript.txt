What is she doing there? Well, she has a guest. That's why we call it the guest house. Oh, thanks. 45. [inaudible] 25. 20. [laughter] [knocking] BRIDGET: Who is it? - It's Sandy. And Sandra. Why'd you stand us up? You should have called or something. We were worried. What are you doing in there? It's so nice outside. Are you coming? I have a guest. Anyone we know? Is it a guy? He's a homeless man. Cool. Let's see him. Can we look at him? Can we touch him? OK, but he's not a pet or a caged animal. He's a person like you and me. Of course. Rad. Wow, what an exciting day. First, I get my period and now this. Wow Cool. He looks fine to me. Why doesn't he have any clothes on? I'm washing him. He was really dirty when Daddy hit him. Your dad hit him? Well, actually William was pulling out of the driveway. Wow. He looks fine to me. He hasn't said a word yet. I don't know if he can speak. What is your name? Your name? What is your name? What is your name? Your name? Name? Your name? If you yell in my face one more time, I'm going to spank you, Sandra. Just 'cos I'm homeless doesn't mean I can't talk. It just means I don't have a home. Get it? Homeless, not speechless. Homeless. And if you contort your face like that name one more time, I will vomit in your face. Gross. Never knew such pretty girls could make themselves look so ugly. Not only does he talk, but does he talk a lot. Well, fun's over for the day. He speaks. I liked him better when he didn't talk. Me too. Much more excitement. Sorry to disappoint you ladies. Well, I guess that's all. We're going to the beach. You coming? What am I going to do with my guest? Well, you do didn't run him over. No, you guys go. Maybe I'll see you tomorrow. OK. Cool meeting you. Yeah, rad. My sentiments exactly. What does rad mean? You know what cool means, right? For a long time. Well, rad's five times cool. I get it. You're very pretty. Are you going to rape me? I'm homeless, not a rapist. Why didn't you speak earlier? You didn't ask me too. Good point. All right, what did you guys forget? Do you want to tell me what is going on here? We're missing valuable sun. What is your problem? This is. I'm sorry. What's your name? I thought I was bad. Here's my 18-year-old sister sitting here with a half naked man twice her age, and she doesn't even know his name. Where have you been all morning? Around, taking care of-- Joshua. My name is Joshua. And if you have my clothes, I really have to go. I thank you for your food and for your tender touch. You're really a sweetheart. Tender touch. Did you sleep with him you slut? Watch your mouth, young lady. Even though you're older, you can learn a few things from your sister She has a kind, compassionate heart of gold. If it wasn't for her, I might have been left for dead. Well, you really weren't dead. No, but it makes a more colorful story. Now, I really got to get going. I have a very dear lady friend who'll be worried sick if I'm not there. You're married? Girlfriend. Very special girl. Without her, I think I'd be dead today. Like I say, there are people that don't have homes and are alive inside, and there are people that have the best homes and are dead inside. Like our father. For someone with a smart mouth, you sure have great eyesight. Great. Now can we get back to the sun and fun, please? How will you find her? That's his problem. If I don't give at least six guys my telephone number today, it's going to be a wasted day. They never call anyway. That's not true. They always call. Call, call, call, call. That's all they ever do. How will you find her? I don't know. But it better be before dark. Well, your clothes aren't dry yet. I've worn wet clothes before. Nothing new to me. Got to go, got to go. Any friend of ours doesn't have to wear wet clothes. I'll be right back. He's not our friend. He's your friend. I'm not going to get grounded over this. Shut up. Last time we got grounded, we were two. We have to help Joshua find his girl. It'd help if you had a car, wouldn't it? I suppose. Thanks for coming. Coast is clear. Hey, that's the guy I ran over this morning. Now he looks like a lawyer or something, like a real guy. He is a real guy. I don't know why you're doing this, but good luck.

I want to take them home with us. What? Are you crazy? Your father's going to go nuts. You're right. Help me figure out a way around him. You know, Bridget, maybe those people are better off where they're at. Who could be happy out there? With talk like that, you could end up sleeping in the street.

Do you think we're doing the right thing? I mean, once we step on this side again, it's so hard to go back. Let's try it. The girls are giving us this chance. I think I'm ready to join it again. Join the rat race, get a job, and buy insurance, and vote, cheat lie. As long as we're together, everything's gonna be fine. Oh baby, money changes things. I have money. Yeah, but every time you get to 10,000, you give it to Food for America. You never buy anything with it. I buy you cigarettes. Oh shush. Come on. You're worried about nothing. I got a surprise for you. Close your eyes. Come on. Close your eyes. OK, OK. [guitar playing] Where's your old one? It got run over. Oh. Bridget gave me this one. Are you sweet on her? She could be our daughter. Still not too late. I love you. I love you. (SINGING) Listen, little Noreen. Please listen to me careful. Why flood so many eyes with tears, when you can bring one heart love and laughter? Listen, little Noreen. Please listen to me careful. I am laying down a law that you had better not defy, give them all a farewell party, I'm taking over that's no lie. You just get yourself together now. I'm back on the scene once again, back on the scene once again, I'm back on the scene once again. Listen, little Noreen. Please listen to me careful.

Throw the ball. Are you OK? I'm fine. Where's Noreen? Sleeping like a newborn. I didn't have the heart to wake her. So what are you going to do today? Hit the city, look for work, maybe a place to stay. What kind of work? Handyman, you know, jack of all trades, master of none. Is that what you did all your life? In between singing. You sing? Oh my god. I write and sing songs. Why don't you look for a singing job? If it was that easy, I probably wouldn't be talking to you right now. Bridget, can I ask you to do me a favor? All you have to do is ask. Noreen is not used to getting up without me. Maybe if you went back to the house in a little bit-- I'm leaving now. Don't worry. I'll be with her. Thanks. You've been a great friend. I appreciate it. All right. See you. - Good luck. - Thanks. I'm going to need it. Hey, thanks for the guitar. Joshua. Yeah. The ball. Whoa. What's your name? OK, I'll shut up. Slave, you've won for 30 minutes and not one second more with my beautiful goddess like body to feast on with your eyes. My sumptuous 36, 22, 34, statuesque figure is yours to drool, saver, dream, and stare at in the sick wanting way that fitting of your low life stature of a slave. You disgusting pig! And if you're a good little pig of a slave-- squeal for me. Come on, squeal like a pig. [squealing] I will allow you to kiss it. If the price is right. [squealing] Oh, Harry. Good morning.

Want some orange juice? I'll get that for you, ma'am. Take a break, Edward. I have hands. Are you sure you girls aren't adopted? That's what I always say. Can I ask you a personal question? How'd I become homeless? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be nosy. It's OK. I was a schoolteacher. The city cut back on the budgets, and I lost my job. I was living from check to check, and school teachers don't make that much money anyway, and before I got another job, I was evicted. So then I lived in my car for a few months. Then I had to sell that so I could eat. You know, when you haven't got much, and you're alone, it doesn't take much. I've called everyone, and we're all set for the party. Now I'm going to go to the beach for a while. I'll go back to the guest house. No, you have to come with us. Are you ready? Where are we going? When's your birthday? I really don't remember. I do. How do you know when her birthday is? It's today. Oh I get it. Better than the beach. Happy birthday. [music playing] Harry, time to work out. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[laughter] You be stylin'. How'd it go, babe? It's strange. I put in a few applications here and there. It's tough when your last date of employment is five years ago. So what did girls do today? Oh the girls took me shopping. - They did? - They did. We had such a good time. You didn't pick up on any cute boys, did you? No, but we got a few winks and whistles. I bet. [laughter] How about playing a song for us, Mr. guitar man? Sure. [guitar playing] (SINGING) You got ears, I got ears. Ears are made to listen. A mouth ain't made to [inaudible]..

You've got to earn my money, and even then, I don't know if I'm going to give it to you. You wasted my food and my beverages to the tune of $2,385. And until you get a job and pay me back every dime, I don't want to see you! Just wanted to say how nice it was to be home. These damn homeless people are haunting me. I'll fix their asses. Give me the district attorney's office. WOMAN: (ON PHONE) District attorney's office. Let me speak to the DA. WOMAN: (ON PHONE) One moment please, sir. I'll teach them to sleep on my damn doorstep. They don't know who I am. I've got connections in this town. District Attorney, Clarice Matthews. Good morning, District Attorney Matthews. Go on. [squealing] And Mistress Clarice. This reminds me of going to baseball games as a kid. My dad always used to get me hot dogs, hot dogs and the smell of cigars. I knew it was springtime. I once had a try out with the New York Yankees once. Yeah, it was a long time ago. I could hit the ball a country mile. That's before the car accident took my legs. Realize all I can do is play baseball. But you can't play ball without your legs. Oh a little [inaudible]. [laughter] Well, you remember the crash. Yeah, which one? Black Monday. Black Monday was charcoal Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and just never stopped getting blacker. Looked like a cotton field. Hey, hey, hey. You don't have to make this a black thing, you know? Oh I didn't mean any disrespect. Sound like disrespect to me. I was just making a point. Here they go again. - Take it back. - Take it back. Take it back. You take it back. Apologize. Apologize. That's right, apologize. Hey, you don't sell Sammy what to do. Nobody tells Sammy what to do. Come on lay off her. Stop goofing on her. She didn't mean any harm. Don't get involved with these guys. They are the best of friends. They fight and scream all the time, but they love each other. They'd give the shirt off their backs if the other needed it. Ain't that right? [interposing voices] Has anyone seen Joshua? Who's looking for him? Joshua! Venessa. [interposing voices] What do you want? I came to say I'm sorry, and I was wrong. Are you staying? I've got a plan. Here we go again. [music playing] JOSHUA: Where we going? BRIDGET: You'll see. WOMAN: Can't we just stay in the limo? BRIDGET: Limos don't have cable. Move over. Let me plug my curling iron in. Here we are. It's a little dusty, but at least it's safe and warm, and it doesn't smell. What is this place? It was our father's first business. When he closed it down, he said he'd never sell or rent it. It was a neighborhood restaurant. When I was eight years old, I used to make myself burgers in the back. I was too little. So I had to stand on a milk crate and watch. Believe it or not, our father was a really nice guy at one time. Every Thanksgiving, he would open up and feed people for free. And our mother used to help him out. Then he made a few small business deals. With the money in the right places, his sweat and hard work paid off. The money rolled in. Daddy became Father. I can't remember the last time he tucked me in and kissed me goodnight. Boy, with a little work, this place could be something. The bar is beautiful. What did you say? The bar is beautiful. No, Noreen, Joshua. I said with a little work, this place could be something. Yeah, but what? Leave that to me. Could you really do something in here? Overnight with a little help of friends, we could have this place in business. Who would work here? We know a lot of people looking for work. It's going to cost money. We got the credit cards. Mom maxed them out. I couldn't even get gas today. Can you imagine that? You think this is good charity? Right now, the best. Look, don't you sweethearts worry. We're in business. [music playing] MALE SINGER: I was born a soldier of fortune in a [inaudible] that had no name. He was born in the streets of the city, growing up and raising Cain. My daddy tried to make me a man, but Mama loved her little boy. Run away as fast as you can. Then put you down like a broken toy. Time flies when you're alive, so come on. Time flies when you're alive, so come on. Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do to survive. And as I walk the streets of darkness, fallen angels everywhere. Suddenly, I hear them singing. Forgotten children stop and stare. Living on the razor's edge, never satisfied. I think about the things she said. [inaudible] say goodbye. Time flew when you're alive, so come on. Time flies when you're alive, so come on. Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do to survive. Sitting on the razor's edge, never satisfied. I think about the things she said [inaudible] and say goodbye. Time flies when you're alive, so come on. Time flies when you're alive, so come on. How you holding up, Bridget? I'll make it. Fighters always do. Good, because the hard part is over. No, the hard part is ahead. It's no party without people to party with. They'll come. And if they don't, don't worry about the money. It really means nothing to me. Seeing this place like this and giving our friends some work and a place to sleep makes it all worth it. - Come on, guys. Let's get some sleep. It's a big night tomorrow night. Yes. Did you get all the fliers out? Every last one. Good. Venessa. Venessa. Are we going to the beach now? What kind of entertainment are we going to have? You know, people aren't going to hang out to hear me play my guitar. If people come, they'll stay. Entertainment's my life. [chatter] MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, what you've been waiting for, Mark Mason and Ampage. [cheering] [music playing] Girls, girls bring out the drinks. You've [inaudible]. Mother's milk, honey, I've got to keep these puppies up. Trouble in ladies room. - Where's Bridget? - She's busy. She's busy. You plunge. I must go. Anita. Would you get rid of that guy? Dump this dummy over my shoulder, would you? [inaudible] Don't you people do these kind of things? Blow it out your ass, Venessa. MALE SINGER: Don't know where he hides, black and cold baby-- Your presence is required in the kitchen. What's wrong? Fire! [screaming] Just a little one. Ew. MALE SINGER: The beast inside, it's eating me alive. Old recipe of my grandfather's burned a whole village down once, but stuff tastes great. Wonder what they ate. Not bad. (SINGING) She's got long, black hair and eyes like a cat. Manicured nails, dressed in black. She's a mystery. She's queen of the night. She purrs like a kitten in the middle of the night. You know the night drives her fever. The moon sparks her soul. The street lights are fire is burning out of control. She's a pussy cat. Dance, pussy cat. Dance, pussy cat. Dance to the beat of my heart. She's my pussy cat. Kitty, kitty, kitty, oh, you're looking so pretty. You're a tiger in the streets, prowling through the city. Like a cat with nine lives, you always land on your feet. Chasing after you like a dog in heat. You know the night drives her fever. The moon sparks her soul. The street lights are fire is burning out of control. She's my pussy cat. Dance, pussy cat. Dance, pussy cat. Dance to the beat of my heart. She's my pussy cat. Want to be my agent? Give the people what they want. Give them lots of it. I hope they don't all get up and walk out with me and my little guitar all alone out there. You'll never be alone with a friend like me. Just close your eyes and sing. Sing from the heart. OK, one more quick question before we get going here. Why do women have the brains in their heads? Because we don't have a penis. OK, you guys ready for some fun? Great, because let me introduce you to Mr. Joshua Street. [cheering] He can't do it. He'll be fine. [music playing] (SINGING) A lonely man inside a boy, first to build and then destroy. He hides behind a wall of pain, but still the song remains the same. Your love gave me wings to fly. Your love gave me wings to fly. Your love gave me wings to fly. Your love gave me wings to fly. Your love gave me wings to fly. Your love gave me wings to fly. Your love gave me wings to fly. Sing it with me now, baby. Your love gave me wings to fly. Take my hand now, bay. Your love gave me wings to fly. Such a strong love, baby. Your love gave me wings to fly. [sirens] Your love gave me wings to fly. Your love gave me wings to fly. Arrest them. I want these guys arrested right now. They haven't done anything wrong. I don't care. Arrest them all Let's go, you guys. Where are you going? Arrest these guys right here. Arrest them all. Arrest this guy-- wait a minute. Come on over here and arrest them. Who's that jerk? [cheering] [whistles] All right. Who's in charge here? We are, my sister and I. Well, look, you've got 15 minutes to evacuate the premises, or you'll all be under arrest. You're operating without a business license, operating without a liquor license, and operating on a premises that is not your. Breaking and entering and grand theft. I can't believe you're doing this. I thought you'd be proud of us. It's for your own good, so you don't waste your life. We're doing something with our lives, the way you started. Times are a little different, but the idea's the same. We're helping others while learning to help ourselves instead of at the expense of others. Doesn't that count for something? You guys have been handed everything on a silver platter. This place is worth $200,000, plus all the credit cards. Money doesn't grow on trees. Now, that is a lesson. We'd like to buy this place. And we have a down payment. Can we start with 8,000? It's not enough. Sorry. Look, we've all worked too hard now to lose it. I'd consider maybe 10%. Hey, wait a minute. I've got 2,000. We have worked too hard to give it up now. I've got $2,000, too. I was saving to go back to Mexico, but I think I found a home right here. Nice try, but your $8,000 short. Now I want everybody out, everyone out. Let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's go. Out. Everyone. Hold on. Hold everything. Hi, kids. [gasps] Hi, Mom. She spoke to us. She left the house. I still own half of everything you own, at least half the last time I checked with my lawyer. Isn't that right, District Attorney Clarice Matthews? Yes, ma'am. And I have temporary licenses for the girls to operate business for as long as they wish. [cheering] Well, you all have a good evening. Let's go, boys. And good evening, Mrs., I mean District Attorney Matthews. Don't think you're going to get away with this. You, come to my chambers. You ever want to lick the soles of my shoes again, read this to those wonderful daughters of yours. Yes, Mistress Clarice. Harry, squeal like a pig. [squealing] Just read it. I was wrong. I will never be a bad father again. I have been despicable. I don't need this to talk to my daughters. I'm sorry, girls. I guess I've been a real bad father lately, haven't I? For 10 years. Yeah, for 10 years. I'm really proud of both of you. You've done a great job with this place, all of you. It's all yours. You've earned it. [cheering] And? And I'll try to be a better father. I want to be your dad, not a father. It's been so long since I had a hug from you guys. Why don't you come on up here and give me a hug? [cheering] All right, everybody party! [cheering] [music playing] (SINGING) Low, low, low, low, low, low , low. Ask me, Stu, how low can you go? Stu, how low can you go? Well, you ought to know. I've been dancing in the light. I was a midget in a past life. And believe me, I know what low is. Now it's 69.69, and that is something to get excited about, 69 bikinis for 69.69. Bikinis, bikinis, bikinis, bikinis, bikinis, bikinis, bikinis, bikinis, bikinis. Oh, Bubbles. You are not going to need Stu anymore. Daddy's home. You're not going to need this anymore. You're the executioner? I'd rather just be your wife. Come here, wife. [music playing]
