Mr. Rockford. Good morning, Mr. Zucker. I can still get you down on the Otters. New spread is eight. But it's a straddle if you plan to match the bet on the Detroit-Pittsburgh game. I'm still trying to get over the pounding I took during basketball season. Buy you a kick-start before breakfast? Ah, I'm not much of a morning drinker, Zookie. Morning, Jim. Miss Trudy. Zookie. Good morning. Hey, morning, Mr. R. Hi, Carlos. Gents. Jim. ROCKFORD: Good morning, Leon. Ain't no morning a good morning, Jim. Take a look at those idiots out there workin' on their melanomas. Makes me sick. Ain't nothin' goin' right for me these days. Things get better, I promise. Well, how they gonna get better when I gotta float olives for 10:00 drinkers? No offense, Zookie. None taken. Before long, he'll be standing outside waiting for us to open up. He's getting here earlier and earlier. Who? Zookie the Bookie. It breaks my heart. I'm really worried about him, Jim. He's starting to resemble Mr. Potato Head. Ah, well, I guess. You know, at his age... You call Dennis Becker about that... That thing we talked about? Oh, Babs. Babs, I talked to him, oh, at least five times on it last year. Uh, I thought since there's really nothing new... You didn't call him, did you? I talked to him three times last month alone. There's nothing there, Babs. Becker's getting angry with me. Hey, morning, Mr. R. Saw you comin' across through the window. Had Pablo put 'em on the grill for you. Thanks, Carlos. I hired a forensic lab in Torrance. They do like autopsies on poisoned animals, cats and stuff who die under peculiar circumstances. They do fecal studies and urinalysis, just like the LA Coroner's Office, only with animals. Good idea. I also sent "em a copy of Cal's autopsy report that the LA Coroner's Office gave me. And guess what? They agree with me. They did? Well, good. It all fits, Jim. I got a new time of death. He was killed at Joseph Cortello's house after work, like I said, at 5:30 p.m. Then they took him away in a car and dumped him in that canyon. He always had peanut butter sandwiches for lunch. You remember that? Yeah, ever since he was a kid. This animal lab said the gastric intestinal juices dissolve stomach contents at about two liters an hour. Okay, this peanut butter sandwich was only partially digested. The stomach bile and colonic enzymes were only partially occluded. That's what they call bowel blocked ingestion. Occlusion. He still had undigested deviled eggs, peanut butter and soda in his stomach, so he died earlier than they said. His colon hadn't processed the contents. It was still just bile-soaked stomach matter. Where you goin', Jim? Something the matter with your omelet? No, no, the omelet's just fine. Babs, honey, you have got to let this go. Let it go? This mobster kills my son, the police don't arrest him, they don't do anything... Because you can't prove it. Well, you watch me prove it. They don't call Joseph Cortello "Happy" Cortello because he's happy. Why do they call him "Happy"? I don't know. The point is, he's a very dangerous guy. You know, they picked him up on your say-so alone because I asked Dennis Becker to do me a favor. And there was no proof. He had a great alibi. He was in church. You know, Cal was up there painting Cortello's pool house. Ten hours later they found him dead in the bushes below Mulholland. That's all you have. That's not probable cause for an arrest. Jim, the guy is a gangster. Oh, he's much more than a gangster. He's a rich, influential gangster. You don't want to lose that thought, Babs. Well, you may be afraid of him, but I'm not. You know what I'm doing? Oh, boy. Oh, boy, is right. I'm staking him out. What? Every night, I park across the street from his house. I take down license plates and descriptions of people coming and going. I am going to get this guy. He can't kill my son and just walk away. Why would Hap Cortello kill him? He saw something. He saw something? Well, duh. He, he saw some slimy deal go down, and this pasta-head gets nervous, goes after him and kills him. But you don't have any proof, Babs I will have. I'm sorry you're not willing to help me. I thought we were friends. Babs. Babs, you can't just park your car in front of this guy's house and then go following him around. You're gonna get him angry. Good. He got me angry, SO now we're even. Excuse me. Hey, Babs. Can I buy you a drink? We can watch the sunset and make up. No need to make up. I gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow, Jim. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on, now. Now, hold it, Babs. Babs, honey... Look, honey, I'm your friend, I really am. And as your friend and a seasoned professional in police science, I have to tell you that sitting out in front of Hap Cortello's house is a uniquely bad idea. Goodnight, Jim. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Hey, get out. I gotta go! No, hold it. Just hold it. Wait a minute. Cal was killed, when, 18 months ago? Eighteen months, three weeks... Yeah. ...four days, and depending on which lab you believe, 10 to 20 hours ago. And the police found nothing. Get out of my car. I'm late. No, no, I can't let you go. Well, it's not up to you. Now, get out! Just hold it, hold it, hold it. You, you go up there and you do what? What, you park down the street, around the corner, out of sight or something? No, I park right across from his driveway. This is a straight-in-your-face stakeout. I want this jerk to see me. I want him to know I'm not through with him. I'm mad. Now, get out. (SIGHS) I'm coming with you. I thought you didn't want to mess with this. I didn't say I didn't want to mess with it. I said there was no evidence. But I can't let you commit suicide either, so let's go. Come on, come on. Look, we're more obvious than Quakers at a barn dance. Back up. Go back down the street. Why? I want him to know I know what a jerk he is. If I can't catch him for Cal's murder, I'll catch him doing something else. That ought to scare him. You're not gonna scare him. Guys like Hap Cortello don't scare. You're gonna flip him off, is what you're gonna do. You know, you want to catch him, just back up, do what I tell you, before we get hurt. Is this far enough back for you, or should we park in Tarzan a? Babs, you asked me to help you, I'm here. Stop attacking me. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) I don't know, Jim. You work so hard to raise your kids, and Cal turns out so good, and... ...dies. I love both my boys, but Corey can be such a little jerk sometimes. He's out there sellin' drugs, gettin' busted. It's like they weren't even brothers. Yeah, I know. I never could understand how brothers could be so different. I keep thinking maybe it's my fault. Maybe I tried harder with Cal than Corey. But then I remember Cal's gardening business when he was just six. (CHUCKLES) You remember him pullin' weeds with that little red wagon so I wouldn't have to work any more? I remember he signed me up. Weeding the pots around my trailer, watering. Dollar a day. Best buy I ever had on a gardener. And he always gave me what he made. He said, "Mom, I'm gonna make you so proud. "One day, I'm gonna buy you a house and a maid, "so you won't ever have to wait on anybody again." And then he made all A's in school and was workin' his own way through college. Yeah, Rocky was probably the best judge of character I ever knew. When Cal died, he... Rocky said, "He was so good, God could only loan him to us." Yeah, well... While Cal was pulling weeds, Corey was pulling car radios. He got yours once, I recall. Yeah, well, he didn't really get it all the way. I mean, just sort of halfway out. He broke it. Yeah, I guess. And he stole from Mr. Critchland at the Sand Castle. And with doing drugs and everything... So who goes and dies? I know that is a horrible thing to say. But I loved that boy, and he tried so hard, and now he's gone, and there is nobody left except me to give his soul rest. (CRYING) Why? Why him? (GATE OPENING) ROCKFORD: There he is. BABS: Okay. You're, you're too close. He's gonna see us. I want him to see us. Jim, I always do it this way. Just drop back. We're trying to tail him, not tick him off. Stay back, Babs. Do it my way, will you? Well, don't stop. Oh. (LAUGHING) BABS: Look at him. We should knock that smile of his right into the dirt. We? Hi. Now, look... (GROANING) BABS: Oh, my God! Jim? Hey, hey, hey. I usually don't hit a skirt, but you keep at it, honey, you're gonna be mewing in the grass with him. Now, you got it? Huh? BABS: Jim. Jim. Oh. CORTELLO: Let's go. (GROANS) Well, now we know why they call him "Happy." COP: Joseph "Happy" Cortello? You want to file assault charges? You're damned right. Assault and battery, public endangerment, illegal parking, grinning hideously in public. You make the list, I'll sign it. So I'll sign the complaint, too. I'm a witness. No, you won't. We don't need you on the complaint. I'm plenty. It might leave a little scar, but it's mostly in a wrinkle, so it shouldn't show too much. Well, my modeling agent is gonna be crazed. Where do I sign this thing? Right there, sir. You go get him. I'll come in and put the hat on him soon as he's hooked and booked. Uh, don't take this the wrong way, Mr. Rockford, but this kind of thing has happened in this precinct once or twice before, okay? Often, people have a change of heart. Now, I don't want to have to go down and pick up Mr. Cortello and go through all that legal BS unless you are absolutely sure you're gonna press charges. I am so sure, my palms are itching. Go get him. Okay. It's gonna take about 10 hours to get the warrant produced, and the booking desk will call you, sir. Now, you see? Now, I don't mean to be an I-told-you-so, but you see what happens when you tail so close? Honest, Jim, I don't get it. You said, "Stay back, stay back," but I, I never stay back, and I've been following him a month and this is the first time it happened. Jim. Zookie. You guys are here early. Eh. Head hurt, couldn't sleep. Got up, my hands started shaking. Me too. Babs here yet? Her day off. It's Saturday. Ah, I forgot. Morning, Jim. Ah, Miss Trudy. Zookie. LEON: Hey, what happened, Jim? Somebody bounce you like a bad check? Leon, Zookie, let me run something by you guys. If it's gonna run, let's get a bet down first. CARLOS: Hey, morning, Mr. R. Hey, Carlos. Well, last night, heh, seems I got into a little tiff with a guy named Joseph Cortello. Happy Cortello? Yeah. You're kiddin' me. He did that to you? Yeah. Giggling all the time, I bet. That's why they call him "Happy." He's got this over-active adrenal gland. When he gets excited, he pumps too much adrenaline and, uh, starts laughin'. Can't control himself. I could have really used that information yesterday, Zookie. What's your question, Jim? Well, you know, this guy, he never let me get set. He got me off balance, slammed me around. I don't usually get marked up like this. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that. No. ZOOKIE: Yeah, we know that. Then he karate-kicked me a couple of times, then threatened me, then just got in his car and drove off. LEON: Just like that, huh? So I called the cops last night at the hospital. I, uh, filed a complaint against him. LEON: You what? Ooh. ZOOKIE: Brave man. Whoa, wrong move, Jim. Yeah, but last night I was mad, you know? I got up this morning, and started thinkin', "Hey, it's a small town. "Everybody has a bad moment now and then. "Maybe I caught Cortello on a bad day. "So maybe the right thing to do is just say, ""Hey, no hard feelings. "'Let's all move on down the road.” It's damned sure the right thing to do, unless you want to take advantage of Forest Lawn's annual special. Oh, not that I'm scared of this melt-down. I can handle him. ZOOKIE: Sure, you can. Oh, yeah, you can. I know. Stuff happens. Absolutely. Exactly. Exactly. Do you have Babs' address? I haven't been to her new place and, you know, I called her, but she didn't answer. I thought I'd just go on up there and tell her. She was a witness. I don't want her callin' the cops or anything, since I'm gonna withdraw the complaint. Babs. Of course. This is all about her kid, isn't it? She got you into this. Aw, Jimbo, come on. You're sharper than that. LEON: No kidding. You know, it's one thing for Babs to get stuck on stupid. It's her kid that got murdered. But you're supposed to be a pro. Now, you oughta know better. Just give me the damned address. (LAUGHING) That one. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Barbara? Barbara? Hey, Babs? Babs? Oh. Oh, Babs. Babs. CHAPMAN: We're looking for Holy Light Drive. Should be off Heavenly Way. Up on the right. MINISTER: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside still waters, He restoreth my soul. COREY: Hey, Rockford. Yo, who's pickin' this up? This looks expensive. Shh, Corey. It's your mom's funeral. ...Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Things haven't been goin' too well for you, I see, huh? You still drivin' that 20-year-old soup can with the eight-track? Shush. ...and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. Our dearly departed has gone on to be with her maker. Yo, Rockford, let me crash at your place tonight. Cops got Mom's all taped up. Shut up. MINISTER: Our memories of Babs are personal... All right, all right, let's get around here. Come on, everybody. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Hustle it up. Come on. Come on. Everybody out. MINISTER: ...those memories must be shared. Trudy Wise, her dear friend, would like to say a few words. Babs and I waitressed together at the Sand Castle for, uh, almost 10 years. Babs. She was always there for all of us, with an extra smile in the morning if we were sad, or a shoulder to cry on, or an extra 10 bucks if we needed it. She would take everyone's order, but what she served was friendship. All right, everybody, gather around. Come on. Come on over here. All right, I want you to take a look up there to the right, under that large palm tree. You'll see Lieutenant Becker. He's the officer in charge of the case, and he's watching the mourners, making notes. So, we shall have a paper on grave site observation. Do we get extra credit for that paper? You know, I read Lieutenant Becker's homicide report that you xeroxed. (SCOFFS) What a joke. I mean, I don't concur that this was a crime of passion. Disorganized crime scene. This was a crime of opportunity, no doubt about it. She didn't know her assailant. CHAPMAN: Interesting. Disorganized crime scene. I hope that tells us something else. BECKER: What's with all these kids, Captain? CHAPMAN: Criminology class. When they're finished at the grave site, I'm gonna take the class to check out the crime scene. Ooh. BECKER: With all due respect, sir, the woman just died. Forensics is still out there, and I can't have 20 kids pawing through my crime scene. No, no, no, these are not kids, as you so euphemistically put it. These are budding criminologists. Every student in this class has a major in either Criminology or Pre-Law. I think letting them have a little insight into a homicide investigation is just what the doctor ordered. This is James Scott Rockford. Mr. Rockford found the body. Over the years, he's found lots of bodies. He's also served time for a Class-A felony. Mr. Rockford is the local area private detective who frequently visits crime scenes and other human disasters. Captain Chapman, should I put him on my list of suspects? I wouldn't put him on your party list, Candace. Who's in charge here? I am. Dr. Trish George. We're studying this murder for a Criminal Behavior class. Then you should be ashamed of yourself. I beg your pardon? A woman we cared for just died. Her friends are here to pay their last respects. This is not a criminal science lab, it's a funeral. Uh, Jim, can I talk to you for a minute? Oh, let go, Dennis. Just shut up and listen, okay? Chapman is out of line, but you don't want to get him riled up. What is this? It's a Southwest California University Criminology course. I know you feel bad about Babs, but you don't want to take on Chapman. This guy is leading a field trip to Babs' funeral? Why? Because she was a waitress and he doesn't think she counts? Calm down, Jim, okay? What if it was the Mayor's wife? You don't think he'd be bringing a bunch of college kids around, do you? Of course not, Jim. Chapman signed on as a guest lecturer at the University. His deal is rumored to include usual fees, honorary Doctorate, first row basketball tickets. Go figure. You're not gonna take these kids up to Babs' house before Forensics even gets out of there? Afraid so. It's part of Chapman's new community relations program. Show 'em how it's done, and maybe they don't throw bricks at squad cars. Don't you just love it? Here we go. Whoo. ROCKFORD: Great, Corey. Just what your mom's funeral needed. (CAR HORN HONKING) Hey, get outta there. Salud. Oh, that funeral was tough. I want you to know, Jim. Nobody thinks it was your fault. No, you were just caught playin' man to man instead of zone. Could a happened to anyone. Thanks, Zookie, but it is my fault. It's my fault. I knew it was dangerous. After he attacked me, I should've known he was a psychotic, and made sure nothing happened to her. Now they got that college class up there pawing through all her stuff. I can't believe Captain Chapman is letting that happen. ZOOKIE: Chapman? You're dealing with a real trifecta idiot there. Jim, we took up a collection, and we want to hire you to find out who killed Babs. There's $600. Trudy, I can't take that. Well, you have to. I mean, well, you cared about her like we did and, and to the cops she's just gonna be some waitress who got killed. A statistic. You loved her like we did. I can't take money for it. No, if you want, you can kick in, too. But, you know, we want to pay you. If we don't, it just won't feel like we're doin' anything. Count me in. ZOOKIE: Well, how about you, Leon? How about me what? We're hirin' Jim to find out who killed Babs. Oh. Everybody's sad about Babs now, hmm? Well, where were you guys when she really needed you? When she was tr yin' to put Cal through college? Where were you guys when she was workin' double shifts and that poor boy was hashin' all night, paintin' houses and gardenin' just to make the tuition? Now he's dead, she's dead. They can't use your money, and you're takin' up a damn collection. You people amaze me. Ah, he don't mean it, he don't. It's just his way. He's hurtin' just like the rest of us. Uh, Jim, what are you gonna do? Where are you gonna start? Well, I got some stuff to do around here, and then I guess I'll go up and take another look at her house. God bless you, Jim. ALL: Thanks, Jim. Thanks. Go get 'em. I will. CRITCH: Babs' is the first locker on the left there, Jim. Thanks for the key, CRITCH. I'll just be a minute. CRITCH: Let yourself out when you're done. BABS: Dear Diary, June has come and I feel like my life has turned around. I have so much to be thankful for. I have my boys. Corey's in rehab, and I'm praying for him. Cal got into Southwest California University. Somehow, we'll scrape up the tuition. Everybody at the Sand Castle is so wonderful. I feel their love and support. Nobody deserves such wonderful friends. { know 'm blessed. (HORN HONKING) Hey, Rockford, what are you doin' here? Hi, Pete. No air conditioning. It's hot as hell in that bathroom. I had to pry open the window just to get some air. TRISH: Mr. Rockford. Good place for a picnic. I'm very sorry about your friend. I can tell. Mr. Rockford, did you have a relationship with the deceased? I hope you plan on picking up all your trash before you leave. Mr. Rockford. I know how this looks. I'm a trained criminal behaviorist. I've worked with several police departments. Then you know these kids shouldn't be here. (SIGHS) I know. I know. The Dean gave control of my class this semester to Captain Chapman, and for some reason he seems to think that this is an important field experience. Excuse me, will you? Look, Mr. Keats, will you stay out of the house till the forensic team gets out of there? They're wasting their time. It's a follow-home robbery turned into murder. The crime did not happen in the bedroom. Follow-home robbery? Weren't you the one who said it was a crime of passion? No. That was me. Well, it's no follow-home robbery, okay? Now, stay out of there till the crime tapes are down. Well, if this is not a follow-home, then I'd like very much to hear you defend your theory, Captain MacEnroe. ROCKFORD: Uh, let me, Captain. Follow-home robberies are generally targeted on people who drive expensive cars. You follow a 560 Mercedes or a Ferrari. Only a drooling fool would follow home a rusted out, 10-year-old clunker. Jim, get outta here. Chapman sees you, he's gonna go ballistic. Hey, what's all that? I gotta grade these for Chapman by 10:00 tomorrow. You gotta what? Let it be, okay? Just get outta here. Dennis, have you got anything? There's not too much here. That's because it was a professional hit. I told you what happened. She's been parking out in front of Hap Cortello's house, following him around for a month. He could have thought she witnessed one of his crooked deals, came up here, and killed her. That's not the way Chapman sees it. Oh, look at that. Look at that! I mean, that fat kid out there drops this, and now it's evidence. You better get these kids out of here. They're contaminating your crime scene. CHAPMAN: What the hell are you doing, Rockford? Becker, what is he doing? What the hell is he doing? Get me a blue out here, right now. DETECTIVE: Yes, sir. Captain, the lab people marked one of those candy wrappers that one of your class dropped. Well, if they marked it, then it's evidence. This is a crime scene. I don't want civilians in my crime scene. Not unless they have a student body card. I don't need wise-ass remarks from you, Rockford. You'd be well advised to listen to these kids. They've studied criminology, which, to my knowledge, you haven't. They've got lots of good ideas. ROCKFORD: Please. I can't take much more. It just so happens that Keats' theory that this was a crime of opportunity and she didn't know her killer is proving itself out. There was a forced entry, and forced entry means she didn't know her assailant. Let me guess. The bathroom window? How the hell did you know that? The Pillsbury Doughboy out front? The one that dropped a candy wrapper. He opened it 'cause he got hot. Go on, ask him. This was no crime of opportunity, it was premeditated, first degree murder. She knew her killer, Hap Cortello. She'd been following him around for over a month. Pete, arrest him. What... You got a charge? How about tampering with evidence, interfering with a homicide investigation? That's just for starters. Oh, and I might even add suspicion of murder. Chapman... BECKER: Suspicion of murder? You better get yourself an attorney, Jim. Now let me get this straight. You're holding him for contaminating a crime scene, while at the same time you lead a class full of college students through the very same location? You don't really want to read about that in tomorrow's paper, do you, Captain? God, how I used to hate it when you were doing criminal law. I thought you were out writing trashy novels now. Captain, I'll always be here to drop a flag on you. My California Bar license is current, so let me fix you a reality cocktail. You keep this up, you're gonna end up lookin' like Captain Kangaroo. (LAUGHS) Okay, Van Zandt, you can have him back. But here's the deal. He's still a suspect in this murder. Wanna bet? And if I catch him in an unauthorized attempt to mess with this case, I'll drop-kick him into orbit. I'll pass it along. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Make him believe it. I'm gonna cut him loose. So get him outta here. ROCKFORD: Well, thanks, Beth. Take that out of your mouth, Jim, and listen to me. I know what he said. It's the same thing he always says. He's gonna jack me if I don't get lost, right? "Drop-kick you into orbit" was the exact expression. Chapman couldn't drop-kick a beach ball into a playpen. I can handle him, don't worry. Jim, listen to me. You could be looking at 10 years. You're underestimating Chapman. He's gonna get you if you don't lay off. If he gets me, you'll get me out. That's the criminal justice line dance. Everybody gets to walk in LA. Eat lots of Twinkies, Jim. BABS: Sometimes life is such a struggle. It's as if God was passing me through the fire to forge me. Corey just can't seem to get it right. Ten hours out of rehab he got busted again. His friends are such grease stains. Why can't he see what he's doing to himself? At least Cal still hums along. He got a job painting houses. On a sweet note, Jim Rockford was in today. He's been gone out of town on business. It was good to see his smiling face. If my boys could end up being like him, I'd feel I'd done my job. I just wish he was a better tipper. ROCKFORD: Well, you must have my transcript. I want to re-enroll in the college. I had three units in '89 fall semester. I took a golfing class. Another true seeker of knowledge. Did you ever get rid of that slice? I like to refer to it as a fade. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) TRISH: Yeah? ROCKFORD: Hi. What do you want? I want to sign up for your class. Sorry. You've got to be a student at this university with a transcript and at least one preliminary course in this field of study. (SCOFFS) You're kidding me, right? I teach Criminal Science. How is Introductory Golf a prerequisite? Uh, both courses are about hitting defenseless objects with clubs. Look, I'm, I'm sorry I came on so strong at the funeral park and at Babs' house. I, I was upset. She was a close friend, and I feel guilty about her death. I was a little emotional. And you were right. We shouldn't have been there. I need to get into your class, Dr. George. Captain Chapman isn't fond of you. You see? Already a character reference. I don't like him either. He's a jerk. Yeah, I, uh, I picked up the Registrar's slip, and she said that I had to get your approval to start the class late. I also got the reading list, a new binder at the student store, and all I need is your signature and a student parking pass. Now, what we have here are the five "W's." Now, we know where she was killed. In the bedroom. What was she killed with? .22 caliber bullet. When she died. According to the liver temperature test, she died at 12:45 am. Now, that leaves "Why" and "Who." Let's take a whack at this, what do you say? Suspects? Anyone? Hands. Ms. Clark. CANDACE: I met this guy at the funeral. His name is Corey Honeywell. He's the dead woman's son. That guy is so fly. He couldn't have done it. He has a record for dealing drugs and petty theft, and I was just thinkin' him for one of the "Whos," or maybe it was a bad drug deal. CHAPMAN: Mmm-hmm. He killed his mom by mistake, for under "Why." CHAPMAN: Anyone else? Hands, please. This guy Rockford is way into the margin for me. I mean, he says he's up there because he wants to tell her that he's not going to file some criminal charge against some guy, and lo and behold he finds the body? This is good thinking. I like this. Now, carry it a little further if you can. I think he's our classic not-very-smart criminal, returning to the crime scene. And who is this guy? He's certainly not an upstanding citizen. He's got a prison record. ROCKFORD: I was cleared, sonny. Unless a pardon in the State of California doesn't mean anything any more. Get out, Rockford. This is a university lab. We don't allow audits. You want some really horrible news, Captain Chapman? I am registered. I am a full-fledged, student body card-carrying heckler. No, you're not. You're outta here. I don't have you on my reg list. Well, you must have the old list. I paid my tuition. I was accepted into the class by Dr. George. I signed him in. I filed it with the Registrar. I didn't think you'd mind. You said the more the merrier. And believe me, I intend to keep it merry. Now, back on our merry way up there under "Who," you might want to add an LA gangster by the name of Joseph Cortello, aka Happy Cortello. Hap dresses up any suspect list. Joseph Cortello. He was the guy who killed those two people with a baling hook last year. He got off on some technicality. ROCKFORD: Yeah, the very same. Now, let's see, up there under "Why," does it bother anybody at all that Babs Honeywell's 22-year-old son Cal was a homicide victim 18 months ago? That's another case. Well, I don't think it is. You know, I don't know about all of you, but I think it's kind of loose for a bunch of college students to be messing around on a case where two closely related people have died in two years and Joe Cortello is in any way involved. But it's a follow-home killing. This killing was not done by some zooted-up junkie. It was a premeditated homicide. It was committed by a top-shelf psychopath, and if I were you guys, I think I'd pick a case where the suspects don't eliminate witnesses. I don't want to get killed in this course. All right, all right. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me make something very clear here. This class was assigned to study every aspect of the Honeywell murder, and they're damn well gonna do it. (BELL RINGING) Class dismissed. And stay low. Outside. I don't want to niggle and whine, but isn't there some sort of conduct code that's supposed to exist between a student and teacher? You need a prerequisite course for this class. I got one. I've been accepted by the Registrar. But if that's not enough, 1, uh, took advanced criminal courses in Sweet Potato Gardening and, uh, Shower Stall Combat at Quentin. Now, those credits should transfer. You want to get in this class, huh, Rockford? Why? For what possible reason? I missed the circus this year. Uh-huh. Okay, I can live with that. But, uh, you enrolled two weeks late, so I'm gonna need a 30-page make-up paper day after tomorrow on, uh, lemme see, uh, oh, how about "The Collection and Preservation "of Physical Evidence in a Homicide"? The what? I want you to pay particular attention to latent fingerprinting, selection, shipment, as well as proper evidence packaging. I mean, you just so much as miss one section, I'm gonna come down on you like a concrete wall. Then I'm gonna remove you from this class for failure to perform. I've had that complaint before, but never from a guy. Uh, Shipment and, and what? Oh, when you make up the paper, use a bibliography and proper footnotes, one-inch margins. Neatness counts. TRISH: Hi. Hi. That was some dust-up you had in class. Ah, well, Chapman and I have a bad history. I heard you have to write a paper. Yeah, and neatness counts. All I can say for sure is, it's gonna be a very neat paper. This ought to do it. Gotta get these back to my trailer. Why are you so determined to stay in this class? CHAPMAN ON TAPE: This class was assigned to study every aspect of the Honeywell murder, and they're damn well gonna do it. By insulting him, I managed to finesse that statement out of Chapman. That's why I wanna stay in your class. To study the murder. Jim Rockford, the private investigator, has been told by Doug Chapman, the police captain, to stay away from the Honeywell murder case. However, Jim Rockford, the college student, has been assigned by Doug Chapman, the college professor, to investigate the very same case. I'm gonna prove that Hap Cortello killed her. How? I need you to, uh, give me a special assignment. A what? I need to be assigned a field practicum to access and coordinate some research material. What's he ea yin'? Yeah. He's gonna break into Babs' pad and toss it. Yeah. Okay. I want to go with you. Me too. Well, why don't we just get Leon and Zookie and hire a bus? If I don't go, there's no assignment. (BANGING ON DOOR) ANGEL: Jimmy, Jimmy, open up! Angel, is that you? Open it up, Jimmy. I ain't got all night. Man, what is with your neighbors? I'm just walkin' past some bicycles, and this dink unleashes two Dobermans at me. There's more German dogs out there than a Bavarian polka festival. You're a regular Willy Loman. All this for sale? Heh, heh, heh. My new product line sample kit. Huh? Huh? Oh, there's bargains here to make your heart sing. I tell you what, Jimmy, nobody sells this stuff cheaper than I do. This is the list price. Hot stuff usually goes for a 90% discount. It's not hot, it's previously owned merchandise. Take your time. Let's just leave it out here, huh? Let you get used to taking a look at it. Let it become part of your life. I'm not buying any hot goods. I have enough trouble with the police as it is. It's not hot. Right. Angel, you used to write the Mrs. Lonesome Heart column for your brother-in-law's newspaper, so this job'll be a snap for you. That Lonesome Hearts Club column is a loser's waiting room. What a bunch of pathetic whiners. (MIMICKING WHINING) Would you pay attention? How much am I getting paid to write this again? 100 bucks. And you buy the Hormel juicer? 100 bucks for the paper. That's all. It doesn't have to be good. Just fill in the pages. Now, here's some books on evidence gathering. And Angel, would you try to make it look like I wrote it? You want it illiterate? When's it due? Tomorrow. And use my computer. Use it here. I know my computer, Angel. You try to swap it for some piece of junk, I'll come after you with something worse than a German dog. What's worse than a German dog? A German pistol. Now, get started. (CHUCKLING EXCITEDLY) Too bad. This is a honey! Uh, who's there? (GUN FIRING) (GROANING) Ahhh! KEATS: God. TRISH: Jim. Oh, God, I shot him! I shot him! Is he all right? God! (SIREN BLARING) Get me clamps, a blood match, sponges and a tray of splinter and hemostatic forceps. I don't like the sound of that. And a gas-passer. Stat. Let's get this guy down. MAN: Comin' in. BABS: Mr. Critchland was with the accountants all day today. He tries so hard, but the Sand Castle just never seems to make enough to justify all our efforts. I think we should all turn down our automatic raises this year to help him out. Well, looky-here, it's Professor Chapstick. Hey, you're gonna have to give me a late excuse on my paper. It's comin' along great, but, you know, it's hard to make progress with the morphine drip and half my arm missing. I gave you direct instructions to stay off this case, but you march right up there and hot prowl the murder scene. Doug! You don't mind if I call you Doug? I'd sort of like to mine this student-teacher thing we have happening. Shut up. You're gonna eat some felony paper on this, Rockford. Obstructing justice, interfering with evidence... I wouldn't have gone up there if you hadn't asked me to. I never asked you to. CHAPMAN ON TAPE: This class was assigned to study every aspect of the Honeywell murder, and they're damn well gonna do it! Oh, yeah. And you expect that to stick? I assigned him to re-define your motive and time-of-death theory. I'm speechless. It's a big improvement. Re-define the motive? The motive was profit. It's always profit. Well, I don't wanna contradict, Captain, but besides profit there are six other classic motives. Jealousy, revenge, to cover a crime, to avoid humiliation or disgrace, accidental homicide, and homicidal mania. Any of this gonna be on the final? You're busted, Jimbo. Do you mind if I call you Jimbo? You know, this whole thing's not gonna play well down at Parker Center. You're hangin' way over the fence here, Doug. You've got your honor student slinging lead at the class cut-up. The whole lesson plan may need a re-tool. (LAUGHS) Yeah, sure. You really shouldn't be leaving. I mean, that wound could get infected and we'd have to drain it. Your sutures could pull. I am leaving. I stay in the hospital more than a few days, I get a soft palate. How are you gonna get home? You can't drive. Schaefer Transport Service here to transport James Rockford. Well, you guys got great timing, but I didn't order an ambulance. Uh, you know a Trish George? Well, she shouldn't be wasting her money on an ambulance. Well, she's already done it. Paid in advance. Want the ride, or not? Oh, I guess. Yeah, let's go. We've been traveling along time. You sure you guys know where you're goin'? We're almost to Malibu Hills now. There's the bug in the clam sauce. I don't live in Malibu Hills. Sorry. Malibu Hills is the delivery point I've been contracted for. I'm rewriting the contract. Hey, just take it easy, Mr. Rockford. Or what? Or nothing. Just don't make this into a situation. Let me guess. You guys work for Hap Cortello. MAN: Go give 'em a hand. Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm a foot wide and a mile tall. Either give me the chair or yell "timber." Ohh... And, up. So we'll wait if you want. Please. Somebody should see to the remains. Ramone. Ramone, listen. Try, uh... Try OceanView Drugs, all right? They're closer. Right away, Mr. Cortello. I think I'll beg off. I've had plenty of drugs for a while. Huh? What's the matter with you, huh? I'm not gonna hurt you. I want you to be my guest for lunch. Ha! I ordered out for, uh, sushi. You love it? (LAUGHS) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ramone! Uh... Have Dr. Klinburg phone the guys at the drugstore. I need that now! You got it. Go, will you! Sinuses? Allergies? Flu? Ah, I got, uh, I got what they call, uh, bipolar illness. That's what they call it now, bipolar illness. It don't sound so bad that way. Sorry to hear it. Yeah, they used to call it manic-depressive. Now, they call it bipolar. Sometimes, when I don't have my Lithium, uh, I blow off the needle and kick the crap outta somebody. Not to be prying, but, uh, is that what you're out of? What Ramone is after? Yeah. I thought I had some in the pool house, but my wife must have taken it out the last time she was there. You know, we're not, uh, entirely moved in. The way these contractors are goin', we ain't never gonna finish. You can borrow my ambulance if you want! It might speed things up! Thanks, but I've got a car. Go, will you! Now! Look, Mr. Rockford. Jim. I'd like to apologize for what happened the other night. And I wanna make it up to you, because... Oh, that's not necessary. You probably just needed your Lithium. Will you shut up and listen! Okay? I'm trying to have a civil conversation here with you! Why do you keep interrupting me, damn it? I'm trying to say I'm sorry! Look, you're gonna have to excuse me. Uh, I'm not well. I've lost a lot of blood lately, and what I've got left would launch a SAM missile. Yeah, this woman. Babs? She thought I killed her kid. I liked him! He was painting my pool house. Why would I kill him? Well, no kidding. Why, indeed? I have a very good alibi. I was at a church fundraiser with a cardinal. You probably read that in the police report. I mean, you ever even know a cardinal? I knew a couple of Dodgers once. You makin' fun of me? No. No, I'm just trying to get the picture. You paid for an ambulance to bring me up here so you could tell me that you didn't kill Cal and his mother, is that it? Quit that, huh? What, what, what? Putting words in my mouth! I hate that! Well, okay. Okay. Hey, what?... Wha... Ahh! Ah, well. Well, here we are. Yeah. Kind of hot for this time of year. You know, usually it doesn't get this oppressive until mid-July, you know, except for a little breeze, and... I'm tr yin' to say I'm sorry. I, I, I want to apologize to you for kickin' the crap out of you. So why are you makin' me so damn mad? NICKY: I can't find it, boss! Try, uh, the master bath upstairs! It's a little white bottle with a yellow safety cap! All right, boss! I'm sorry if I hurt you. I wanna pay for your hospital bills. But I'm gonna ask for a favor in return. I want you to stop saying... ...I killed your friend, because I didn't. Can you do that for me, Jim? Oh, I can absolutely do that. You didn't kill Babs, you didn't kill Cal. There. I said it. I feel better. I hope you feel better. No. I don't. 'Cause I'd like to smush you! You're tickin' me off! Nicky! Nicky! Yeah? The, uh, the Jacuzzi drawer where Dawn keeps her suntan lotion! I'm havin' a hard time keepin' level here! Okay, okay! Uh, well, could you try? I can't take much more abuse. I'm gonna ask you to stop accusin' me of killin' that idiot bitch, okay? Done. NICKY: I got 'em, boss! Well... Well, this has really been enjoyable. Uh, would you... Would you be kind enough to, uh, take me to my ambulance? Oh, I'm gonna be level in a minute. You gonna stay for lunch? Well, the ambulance is double parked and I got a lot of things to do. Tape up my lip, empty out my shoes. Well, remember what I told you. You do me that favor. I owe you! Done. Good. Huh! Uh, your name was, uh, Nicky, was it? Yeah. Well, let's, uh... Leave? Yeah, good idea. Shall we? BABS: Leon bought a new fishing boat yesterday. It's the first time I've seen him happy. Cal worked for him last summer in the storeroom and said that Leon was a pessimist who always saw the glass as half empty. He's a grouch, but a lovable one. On the bright side, Corey got a new parole officer, and this time I'm hoping he can finally get it right. (BRAKES SCREECHING) (CAR DOOR SHUTS) Hi. (SIGHS) You look different. Well, nylon isn't my best fabric. I'm much snappier in tweed. The University closed down the Criminal Behavior class. Oh, what a bummer. Leaves my fifth period open. And your friend Chapman wrote a letter to the Dean saying that the reason the accident happened was because I failed to control the curriculum. I'm sorry, Trish. Maybe I should write a letter and straighten them out about Chapman. Probably won't help. Oh! Babs' diary? Yep. Anything in it? Nope. She was a sweet person. She cared more about everybody else than she did herself. As I was reading it... You could see what a tender soul she was. Nobody ever gave her anything. You... You think a 10% tip is too little? Most people give 15. 20, if the service is great. Oh. I always give 10. All my life I've worked. Nobody ever tipped me. Yeah, but you can set your fees. Waiters and waitresses are underpaid. They depend on the tips to make up the difference. Seems like 10% is enough. (SCOFFS) Sometimes I don't even get paid for my work. Damn! Angel stole my computer! Rounding out a perfect week. Look, what are we gonna do now? Ah, I guess we gotta go do what we started to do a couple of days ago. Go up to Babs' house and see if there's anything up there. You know, she kept a, uh, notebook on her investigation of Hap Cortello. It's gotta be there somewhere. If she saw something to give him a reason to kill her, then we need to know what it is. Isn't that dangerous? Well, it has been so far. This time, I intend to control the field trip and the curriculum. Probably better than the last time. Melissa? After you get your clothes on, if you're armed, please don't shoot. What are you talking about? Of course I'm not armed. Hey! It's Jimbo the gimbo. Corey, what are you doing here? Hey, Mom's place is mine now. Soon as the cops split, I did a tight vector and crashed. Do you think we could get in off the front porch? I've been drawing a lot of fire lately. Well, you've made a few changes. Yeah. Well, maybe that's 'cause you bled all over the place. By the way, Melissa can't get that stain out, so, uh, I'll be sending you the bill. Oh, yeah. Like it was everywhere. It was very ucky. I mean, I wore his mom's yellow rubber gloves, but I'd like love to see an AIDS certificate. I've been leaving blood all over town. You'll have to wait till I get xeroxes made. Yo, Rockford. Nobody invited you in there. Where's your mom's stuff? In storage. What? Can't live here if all the drawers and the closets are full. Aren't you going to hit him, Corey? Melissa, a woman died here. His mother. I never knew her. I'm choking on all this sentiment. Where's your mother's stuff? Well, I ain't gonna be around much after I sell this dump. And I don't have any place to put it, so if you're really interested... I'll sell it to you. Sell it? You serious? Sure. How much you got on you right now? About 100. What, are you kiddin'? For a guy choking on sentiment, that's a helluva fur ball there, eh, Jimbo? I mean, this stuff has great sentimental value to me. 250. I've got 75. 175. You are such a loser, Rockford. Ha! My brother Cal used to always say you were okay, you know, but I just never saw it. To me, you're just always runnin' in place. Why don't you give it up? Start baggin' groceries. It's always good to get advice from a guy in the diamond lane to Terminal Island. We got a deal? Throw in your watch. My... Then we got a deal. Come on. I'll, uh, show you where I stored it. Ugh. He is horrible! That's not storage, that's trash. What makes him like that? Ah, he got dealt an extra Y chromosome. He can't help it if he's a psychopath. Do you think you could bring your car in here and uh, we could pack the stuff and get outta here, before I do something really stupid? It's good! Look at Babs. She was having fun. Hey, remember? She gave us all coconut brownies that she made? I got it. This is what I was lookin' for... Her investigative log. She had this in the car the night I was with her. Leon, a little celebration? With an olive in it, please. Anybody else? No, thanks. Not me. A colorful drunk is a long-standing tradition. Every saloon needs one. (LAUGHS) Besides, it's in Babs' honor. Zookie, Babs worried about you. She told me the day she died she thought you were hittin' the bottle to hard. She cared about you. We all do. Yeah. Instead of having a drink in Babs' memory, why don't you, uh, not have one in her memory? She was worried about me? Very much. She was afraid you were killing yourself, and it broke her heart to watch you do it. You really know how to ruin a celebration, don't you? Do you think we're missing something real obvious? Oh, probably. That's been the keynote in at least half my investigations. (LAUGHS) Now, I know that you think Hap Cortello did it. What about Corey? That little viper could have killed his mother. He also could have killed his brother Cal. Yeah, I've known Corey since he was six or seven. The one thing about him, he was never really up for the big one. He was a sneak. He'd take your car radio when you were out of town, or steal your bike when you went to the bathroom, but I've never seen him get physical with anyone. He's all show and no go. Yeah, but he could have done it. He needed money for drugs, or something. He goes to his mom, they fight about it, he loses his temper and he kills her. I just can't see him banging away at her with a .22. It just doesn't fit my picture of him. Anything in here? I got six addresses out of there. She followed him to a warehouse on Slauson, a beach house in Malibu, a bar in Venice called the Pineapple Factory, a nightclub on Melrose, and two motels in Glendale where he met different women. Neither was his wife. Hmm. So what are you thinkin'? We need to find a transformer. A transformer? Street slang. Transformer is somebody who would roll over on anyone immediately to save themselves. You know one of those? Intimately. Jimmy, Jimmy, stop it! I almost finished the paper! Forget the paper. The class got canceled. You stole my computer. I told you not to take my computer. Well, I had to work on it here because I had some deep and pressing business engagements I had to attend... Yeah, like fencing the Hormel juicer? Yeah, that, amongst others. Angel, I am seconds from ending your life. You are circling the drain. Don't mess with me. I don't mess with you, ever. Ever. Maybe once. Maybe twice. Okay, I mess with you a lot! All right, we'll get back to my missing computer in a minute. I think I can get that back for you, Jimmy. I need some information. Information? Heh-heh, ding-dong! That's a specialty. I can't give that away free. I mean, that would affect my overall price structure, my downstream revenue flow. I mean, I can get you a watch, get you a microwave oven, I can get you a Hormel juicer. Man, all of that's yours. Especially the Hormel juicer, 'cause we're overstocked. But information? That costs money. Generally your credit is acceptable. Let's deal. Let's. Hap Cortello. What's he into these days? Well, heh-heh, that's a broad category. I mean, it'd be hard to ascertain what a top-shelf yodeling wacko like him was up to, unless you surprise me with some pertinent doohickeys. Well, we know he's into drugs. Uh-huh. We know he's into vice, we know he's got some extortion going. You know, lots of action. But this is something big. Something he'd kill for. Well, I don't know, Jimmy. People on the street aren't talking about that fruitcake. Hey, cuidado! Suitcases. Suit... What? He's selling suitcases. I don't like the sound of that, Angel. Make it sound better. Well, you know, knock-off stuff. Some of that hoochy-Gucci Italian leather goods. You know, purses, wallets, suitcases. I mean, it's nationally a $10 billion business. It's bigger than drugs. So you think he's got a shipment of knock-off bags in that warehouse? Well, how do I know what he's got in the warehouse? You asked me to get you the rumor on the street about Hap. Okay, the rumor on the street is that he's into counterfeit luggage. He's got distributors all over the city. High class stores sellin" it at top dollar, only he gets his stuff in Mexico. Looks exactly like the originals, only when the weather changes, the stitching falls out. You know, this is not the way that two old friends discuss problems. Angel, my computer is back in my trailer by tomorrow noon, or you'll be discussing this problem without your bridgework. If you're interested, the paper I wrote for you is brilliant! (GROWLS) Angel told you this, didn't he? Oh, I have other sources besides Evelyn Martin. Now, let me get this straight. You want me to go down to this warehouse down on Slauson and do what? I want you to wait for Hap Cortello to show up, and then I want you to be the cover story in The Blue Line. That's the Police Department's newsletter. "Lieutenant Becker nabs LA mob kingpin "and a room full of counterfeit luggage.” A couple of problems. What if the warehouse is empty? Ahh, I know nobody trusts a guy who says "trust me," but trust me. Then I would need a warrant, and there's no PC to get a warrant. Lieutenant Becker, I know you don't exactly relish my involvement in this case. Are you kidding? I love grading little blue books. This is not strictly kosher, but it'd work, because there's a legal precedent. 1 go into the warehouse, and I get caught. And then Jim, he runs and calls the police because I've been kidnapped. And since he witnessed a crime in progress, you don't need a warrant. Dennis, this is a great idea. Of course, I'll be the one that gets kidnapped and she'll call the police, but it's perfect. It was my idea. I'm the victim. No way. It's me. No! Ah! (SPEAKING ITALIAN) What's he saying? He's saying, "Rockford will be the victim." (SPEAKING ITALIAN) This is the sloppiest B&E since Watergate. Somethin' we can do for you, Rockford? Nicky, how you doin'? Not good. You want to answer the question? Well, I was passing out copies of Watchtower. I happened to be in the neighborhood, and I thought I saw a light on. Funny. Let's go. Hey, Nicky. Nicky, let me ask you something. Just a question. Has Hap had his Lithium today? Oh, Rockford. Rockford, this is getting very annoying. Well, you know, (LAUGHS SHEEPISHLY) I, uh, changed my mind about lunch. I thought maybe we could have dinner. But, hey, if this is a bad time, we could reschedule. Ah, you... I love this guy! This is a funny guy! Huh? Hap, Hap, come on, now, Hap, don't. Don't do it, Hap. Hey, come on, I'm injured. You don't... You don't want to hit a cripple. No, don't, don't. Don't do that, Hap. Argh! Ohh, hey, ohh! Hold it. Hold it a minute. Hey, I got a... I got a question. What? Whose is this? It's his. He eats "em all the time. Son of a bitch! Nicky, we're gonna be doin' some business. Not very damn likely, slick. (TIRES SCREECHING) Get outta here, boss! OFFICER 1: Everyone stay where they are! OFFICER 2: On the floor! Freeze! You're under arrest! Freeze! OFFICER 1: Don't move. OFFICER 2: Put your hands behind your head! Ah, Dennis. Dennis, you still got that Jim-Jam wrapper in the evidence room? Nah, I picked it up. You told me that fat kid dropped it. I left it in my shirt pocket at home. I could've been wrong about who dropped it. You're gonna have to dust it for prints. And then Mr. Zeeno here may want to make a statement. Save himself from bein' booked as an accessory to Murder One. (CHUCKLES GLEEFULLY) You say that Mr. Zeeno dropped a candy wrapper at the scene of Miss Honeywell's murder? Well, that is, as we say, essentially accurate. The aforementioned Mr. Zeeno's prints were on the said aforementioned candy wrapper, which was at the scene of the aforementioned Miss Honeywell's murder, which indicated his complicity in the aforementioned murder. The aforementioned Mr. Zeeno then offered to cooperate with said investigation into said suspect Joseph Cortello, thereby turning State's evidence. The District Attorney said that said evidence would not be made public. He said that said evidence would be said in court. He said, um... Huh. We'll bring you updates as they come in. Now, back to you in the studio. What do you want? I got a little nervous. Well said. And said and said. (ALL LAUGHING) Good going, Jim. You solved the murder. Yeah, Jim. You can have your Denver omelet on the house all next week. Thanks, CRITCH. Zookie, you know what I said the other day? I didn't mean to upset you. She cared for me, didn't she, Jim? Yeah. You know, I found a paragraph last night. I don't think she'd mind if I read it to you. Let's me see... Here it is. "Zookie is one of my favorites. Seeing him at the bar makes me "both happy and sad. I'm happy because he brings light to all of us, "and sad because I know he's somehow lost. "Like all of us, he's looking for something he can't describe. "I pray he finds fulfillment. "He's too good to lose to the dark spot inside him." Couple of times, I was too potted to get home. She let me sleep on the couch at her house. We took her for granted, didn't we, Jim? She had to die before (VOICE BREAKING) we realized what we had. Leon... Is this glass half empty or half full? Ain't neither. Just booze you ain't drunk yet. Think I'll go home. I've had enough. You could help him, Leon. He needs to quit. Zookie the Bookie ain't gonna quit drinkin', and he ain't gonna quit bettin' the nags. People don't change. Not you, not Zook, and not me. Human nature. Lemme run something by you, Leon. Yeah, sure. Hap Cortello killed Babs 'cause she was following him around, right? Appears so. And she was following him around because she thought that Hap killed her son Cal. Yep. There's no evidence to that fact. Why would Hap kill him? Well, he was working up there painting in Cortello's pool house. He saw somethin'. Well, that's what Babs said. Well, when Hap had me up at his house, he told me he didn't kill Cal. He said he liked him. Now, I don't know, it's strange. But I believed him. You want this? It's on the house. Uh, no, thank you. Ah, it just seems unfinished. She just wanted to know who killed her son. Well, I'm gonna stay on this till I make sure I know who did it. That much I can do for her. ROCKFORD: Chapman may have closed this case, buy I don't buy it. I'm gonna do some digging on my own. You want to help? I'm gonna start first thing in the morning. TRISH: Sure. Jim, have you heard from Tennis on Keats? (LAUGHS) Well, we don't talk too much since he put two ounces of lead in my arm. Well, you know, he hasn't shown up in classes for two days, and I tried calling his house and there wasn't any answer. Do you think that, uh, he could've gotten even deeper into this? That he's in even more trouble? Ahh, I don't want to hear that. What's his address? TRISH: This is it. 1526. If this kid is packing, this time I'm gonna feed it to him. I thought you needed a credit card for that. No, no. Credit cards... Button locks and sliding doors. Picks and wedges for deadbolts. It's a complicated science. Maybe you should get it into the curriculum. Unless it's open. Oh, my God. Is he dead? Yeah, and for a long time. I'm sure getting tired of finding bodies. Here's the last number he dialed. Could you take this down? 213-555-0187. (KEYS BEEPING) Dennis Becker, please. Dennis, I found another one. You're the new body-finding champion of the Western Hemisphere, aren't you? Did you kill him, Rockford? Oh, even you don't believe I killed this guy. Why not? He shot you, you shot him. That plays good for me. I have an alibi, Chapman. You be very careful here, because we have a history together, and it includes scores of problematic judicial encounters. You book me, and I'll have Beth Van Zandt set up an asset inventory on your front lawn. Captain, it's a suicide, and that's the way I'm gonna book it. I hate you, Rockford. You're pond scum. (BEEPER SOUNDING) Damn. Deputy Chief again. If I find out who wrote the department that letter about the class, I'm gonna kill him. Don't look at me. It's not a suicide, Dennis. Prove it. The guy was left-handed. How do you know that? Because I sat behind him in class. It's true. He was left-handed. He might have been pigheaded and relentless, but I don't think he shot himself in the head and then changed gun hands. Also, I'll bet if you follow the track of the bullet, you'll find it won't fit with the suicide. What are you trying to say? I'm saying it's another aforementioned murder. The kid was popped. Why? Probably for stickin' his nose in where it doesn't belong. Look who's talkin'. (SIGHS) Can I go home, Dennis? Uh, my arm's throbbing, my head's throbbing, I think I'm starting to drool a little. Yeah, get the hell out of here. Just make sure you're in the office tomorrow to sign that statement. ROCKFORD: Okay, so who killed Tennis on Keats? TRISH: I have no idea. In school, it's all science. But when you're out there in the field and real people are dead, it just... None of it makes sense. Yeah, well, it's the difference in finding your way and looking back. We're still finding our way. Now, Tennis on Keats found the answer, or something reasonably close to the answer. Hap Cortello didn't kill him because he was in jail, and I don't believe any of his crew did because they're not gonna be that loyal to a guy that's goin' to Death Row. Well, then who did kill him? Do you have that phone number? Yeah. Well, maybe whoever's at the end of this line can tell us something. ROCKFORD: It's gotta be somebody Cal knew. TRISH: I still think it was his brother. Everybody loved Cal. It seems obvious that Corey just couldn't deal with it. Eh, maybe. I hate to think it could've gone down that way. I mean, Babs' family destroying itself from the inside. Most people in law enforcement are cynics. You are a romantic. Pretty cute, isn't it? I can't go diggin' around in my files for a bunch of useless old information. Mr. Liggitt, please help us. We've nowhere else to go. Two people have died. 50 bucks. I got 20. We ought to save something for gas. I'm almost on empty. I've got 15. 30. In the old days, I'd just offer to deck a guy like that, but I'm not healing as fast as I used to. Don't apologize. He's a creep. We're bound to run into a few. Here it is. Joseph Cortello's pool house. Replumb. He was having it renovated. We put in a Jacuzzi and new showers. Gumpy Cook did that work. Does he still work here? He's in the back. Probably stealin' lock washers instead of loadin' the truck. Don't hold him up. He's late. WOMAN OVER PA: Joey B, your delivery is in. Maybe we should ask what he looks like. What, Gumpy Cook? With a name like that, he's gotta look like Mr. Plumberbutt. And there he is. Hey, Gumpy. I know you? I'm a friend of Cal Honeywell's. Two days ago, I would've said, "Who the hell is Cal Honeywell?" But you're the second guy asked about him in 24 hours. And the other one was, uh, Tennis on Keats? Yeah, that's the name. He was, uh, checkin' on some stolen food. Asked me if that kid, what's his name? Cal Honeywell, mentioned it when he was up paintin' that pool house. What stolen food? How the hell do I know? But I remember, this guy comes up there to Cortello's house, uh, about 12:00 noon the day before they found Cal's body. And these two, they having this huge argument. I mean, they're screaming at each other and such. And then, uh, they go out front, and then about 20 minutes later, this Cal kid comes back in, and he's madder'n hell. He starts paintin' trim, but he's so mad, he's gettin' the, the... the gold trim all over the white fresh on the house. And then he says he's mad at this other guy and he's gonna turn him in. And that was that. You told Tennis on Keats this yesterday? Yeah. I mean, that's when Keats said it was about stolen food. And that's all he said. Get that truck loaded, Gumpy! You and Kelly gotta get that job done at Oak Grove by 2:30. I keep hopin' ol' Carl's gonna blow a valve and take the big bust, but he just keeps on strokin'. Better get back at it. Uh, this guy that Cal had the argument with, uh, was he tall, African-American, say late 40s, early 50s? Yeah. Didn't I mention that? Nope. But thanks for your help. Old Zook didn't make it in this morning. Liver and his kidneys probably arguing over that last gin-soaked pimento. Yeah, old Zook. Kind of fun watchin' him kill himself ounce by ounce. What's that supposed to mean? Let me ask you a question, Leon. Sure, go ahead. What is it? Why do you suppose this place can never turn a profit? I don't know. How am I supposed to know? I just work the bar. Don't you also run the food warehouse in the back? So? Well, you take inventory and everything. Uh, log in the meat, check it out, throw it away if it's bad, stuff like that. Is this leadin' up to somethin'? Well, that boat you bought last summer, what does a deal like that cost? I don't remember. Well, a Sea Ray 30-foot Sun dancer. I've got the sales brochure right here. As I recall, when I went out with you the last time, you had everything on it. You had navigation, Sat Nav. You got that, right? Furuno Radar, the 75-mile color unit. Isn't that the rig you got? Yeah, $105,000 plus tax puts that little honey in the water. You tr yin' to say somethin', Jim? Eh, Cal worked here the summer he died, in the warehouse for you, as I recall. You ea yin' I killed him? And Babs? Not exactly. No, I think Cal caught you stealing from the Sand Castle. Maybe skimming 10% off the food and bar purchases. That would lean out ol' Critch's profit picture. Cal confronted you, you went up to Cortello's house and you got in an argument with him. You're nuts! Ah, pretty soon, you know, somebody starts takin' a swing. Cal goes down, hits his head, and he's dead. I don't have to listen to this. And of course, there's, there's Babs. Babs is so sure that Cortello killed her boy that she, uh, starts following him around, finds the warehouse full of knock-off luggage, and gets herself killed. Then along comes Tennis on Keats. Smart-ass, hate-able, but perceptive and bright. He figures out you're stealing. I don't know how he did that, 'cause he took it to the grave with him. It was all right in Babs' diary, right in front of us. How does a guy who pours drinks for 7 bucks an hour end up with a $105,000 boat? (CHUCKLES) You should've left it alone, Jim. (YELLING) You can't beat this one, Leon. The cops are already on their way. I didn't mean to kill Cal. It was an accident. That's what happens when you make the wrong things important. Now I have to kill you, Jim. I don't kill too easy, Leon. I've had better guys than you try. Damn! Damn! Ugh! Damn! Broke out all my stitches! Everybody at the Sand Castle gave you the benefit of the doubt. You'd come in and growl at us, we'd smile and call you the Sand Crab. We were your friends. We were all wrong about you. From the very beginning, you were nothin' but a mean, angry son of a bitch. (SIREN WAILING) Thanks. Does it hurt? Maybe you should take another pain pill. It hurts where I can't get it with drugs. Not much to say, is there, Jim? Nope. Lose-lose. Old Leon. Who'd have thunk it? Yeah, I know. I'm gonna hit the sack early. I'm tired of walkin' around with my arm stickin' up in the air. Feel like a wounded chicken. Jim? What you read about me in Babs' diary really stuck with me. I decided I'm gonna get off the sauce. This morning, I checked into, uh, double-A. Well, that's great, Zook. At least something good came out of all this. You know, Leon said that nobody ever changes. You can do it. We all can. All we have to do is try. He's really down. It's pretty hard when one friend is responsible for the killing of two others. Jim comes on like a tough guy, but underneath, he's pure warm and runny. TRUDY: Well, I'll be damned. ZOOKIE: What? CARLOS: What? He put on 20%.
