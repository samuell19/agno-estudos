There is nothing! - On my phone, there's only... - [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] [MAN CLEARS THROAT] Mr. Baron, it's not like you to come this early. Enough chit-chat. Where's the rest of the money? Regarding that, I don't have the money yet. So, when is your mom going to pay the rest of her debt? Huh? Give me more time to collect the money, sir. You always ask for more time!

[SILLY SQUEAKING] [MUTTERS, GROANS] What I mean, miss... Sir, out of ten customers who visit this shop, nine will definitely choose this pattern. - Because this is a timeless pattern! - [PHONE RINGING] If you get fashion, you will choose this pattern.

You just need to make a video blog talking about myths around you and prove that the myth is a lie! So smooth. Are you on their marketing team? And I have already signed you up with the title, "Your Zodiac Sign, My Soulmate!" - [IN ENGLISH] What? - [IN ENGLISH] Yes. - And the myth I chose is zodiac. - [GASPS] You have to prove that suitable zodiac signs do not guarantee that all relationships will be successful. If you win... Hey! One hundred million. You can pay off your debt and still have a lot left. Problem solved! [SHRIEKS] Are you that sure that my problem will be solved? I haven't even started yet and you are that confident that my problem will be solved? First of all, the title is tacky. Second of all, I have known you since high school. I really know how you get when you're so sure about something. It never ends well. Don't you remember Mr. Daus' test? It was only that one time! [DISGRUNTLED SIGH] No, no, no. And third. That's my Facebook! How dare you log in to it? It's my privacy, you know? First, do you have a better title than mine? No, right? Second, everyone has a zodiac sign, and I'm sure some of them are looking for a lover. So, it is very valid. Third, you're the one who didn't log out, so don't blame me. [ANNOYED EXCLAIM] Whatever! I'm not joining! You do it. I can't. I already registered with your name! If I join, I'll be disqualified! [GASPS] Whatever. - Hold it. - [ANNOYED SIGH] Oh my God, this girl.

Your already have 54 likes, 20 comments, and 12 reads! - [LIVELY MUSIC] - [SHRIEKS] [GASPS] [GRUNTS] Now, you have two choices. You're in or you find an excuse for your followers on why you backed out from the contest and find another way to save your shop. Okay fine, but now what? You just have to go on a date with 12 guys - with different zodiac signs. - [SIGHS] You choose one with a different zodiac but with a personality that matches yours. [SIGHS] God, why is it that when it's coming from you, I always get nervous. And I already know who's our first guinea pig to start this contest. Who? See! - [ARIEL] It's true! I got it right! - [INDISTINCT SPEECH] I just mentioned it earlier. He is kind of weird, but if you really look at him, physically, he's not bad! Out of all the places in Jakarta, why must he open a hot dog booth right in front of my shop? - Spicy? Okay, please wait. - Yes. But look, he has a lot of customers. You're not curious at all? No. Not the least bit. [SIGHS] - [FRUSTRATED SHRIEK] See! - [ARIEL, INDISTINCT] He just delivered it, right? [MOANING] [GROANS] [ANGGUN GASPS] [MUSIC COMES TO AN END] THEMED SOCKS Hi! [GROANS] Hi. [MAN SIGHS] [MUTTERS] Did you get the package? Yes. [CHUCKLES] How is it? Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I just want to ask how the hot dog tasted. Uh, sorry. I'm going now. [LAID-BACK MUSIC] You said it's the shop's bestseller. Huh? Sorry? I was at your shop earlier. Not even 24 hours yet. Oh. How long has it been? Less than 24 hours. I mean, how long has...? [SNEEZES] Ouch. From "Tentang Aku" by Jingga to "Bidadari Penyalamat" by Slank. - How do you know my playlist? - [CHUCKLES] - ♪ Where did my angel go? ♪ - [SHUSHING] [CLEARS THROAT] One of my favorite songs from Slank. [SIGHS] Definitely when you are heartbroken. Including you, I bet. [ANNOYED SHRIEK] Smartass! Who's heartbroken? I'm Agi. Ariel. I'm Joni. - [BRIGHT MUSIC] - [ARIEL LAUGHS] - Yes, but so far, it's still AADC. - [CHUCKLES] Well, it is a classic. But for me, it's Catatan Harian Si Boy. Friends are the family we choose. Oh, it's so obvious. You must choose your friends over your girlfriend! Bet I'm right. Not really. It's all about priorities. [SHRIEKS] Dating a guy like you is like dating a ghost. Between exist and not existing. Have you ever dated a ghost? - No, but I've been ghosted a lot. - [BOTH LAUGH] You seem like the type of girl who doesn't open up easily to guys. Smartass. Am I right? What? Anyway, Gi, it's normal for a girl to think twice if she wants to commit to one guy. Well, that's a theory. However, it's all a matter of the heart. Some open up easily, some take a while. You must take a while. [SHRIEKS] Such a smartass. You're the type of guy who flirts a lot with girls, right? If you play Truth or Dare, you'd definitely choose truth. Oh my gosh, Agi. Is playing silly games like that still a thing? Silly or are you just scared? Excuse me, but scared is just an illusion in my life. - Okay then, Truth or Dare? - Truth. You definitely haven't moved on from your previous boyfriend. - Okay, I choose dare. - You can't do that! Well, your question is stupid. Stupid how? I made it pretty clear. You can't move on from your previous boyfriend, right? We start from the beginning or I'm getting off the bus. Okay. [IN ENGLISH] Promise? - [IN ENGLISH] Promise. - Truth or Dare? Dare. [LANGUAGE] I dare you to get off bus now! - Now? - Yes, come on! Wait, wait, wait! Now? Right now, Gi? - Yes, right now! - We could die, Agi! - We won't. Come on. Hurry! - No, we can... Agi, please! Okay. Now, it's your turn. Gi, I hate playing this kind of game. Don't want to or are you scared? - [IN ENGLISH] Okay, Truth or Dare? - Dare. I dare you to publicly sing in the middle of the road. Do you dare to? - That's it? - Yes. - Got nothing more challenging? - Just try it first, Agi. Check this. Hi, all. Let's dance like in the movies! [RHYTHMIC CLAPPING] Join me?

Twelve guys, 30 minutes each. Here, I've looked through my friend list on my phone, Facebook, coworkers, even through our high school yearbook. Look what I've found! - This is our outing photo, right? - Yes. - So funny! - Look at Anita. Oh my God! Look, she made it to Bandung. You never saw her again? So, where's the first guy's photo? Wait. [GRUNTS] Here. Huh? Why does he looks so smug? Is there no one else? His name is Tim. My tutoring friend back in middle school. He's a Capricorn, ambitious, narcissistic, arrogant. Ew. He just returned from a world tour. He likes taking photos, painting, and collecting statues. Cool, right? Whatever. That's enough. Next, please! One at a time. Where's the outing photo again? It closed. - There. - Oh, okay. - Wait. This is Darius, right? - [indistinct[ Why not him? Uh... He has the same birthday as me. But I don't know if he's single or not. So, I'll find out first, okay? Who's this Alfred? That's my crush. - Not for you. - [ARIEL GIGGLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [ARIEL] So, what about Darius? He has the same birthday as me. But I don't know if he's single or not. So, I'll find out first, okay? Okay. - Hi, Ariel. - Hi. Still have the flu? Hmm... How about the tea I gave you yesterday? Worked like magic. What kind of tea was it? - Not telling. It's a family secret. - [BOTH LAUGH] Okay, what would you like to order today? As usual, I would like to have the hot... [IN ENGLISH] Caffe latte, medium, skimmed milk, - Two spoons of brown sugar. - [IN ENGLISH] That's right! - The tumbler? - Wait. I'll have the Mango Ice Tea. - [IN ENGLISH] Medium. - Mango Ice Tea. Okay. I didn't bring my tumbler today. It's okay. Just use our cup. Okay? - Okay. Let's go, Nggun! - [IN ENGLISH] Thank you! But when I meet all those guys, what should I do? Talk to them. Don't ignore them. Well, duh, I know that. But how? How do I start? Oh my God, Ariel. How long has it been since you went out with a guy? Does Miss Anggun have to teach you everything? Anyway, it all starts with the first impression. You cannot talk about money, religion, and politics. Okay, I cannot talk about money, religion, and politics. Anyway, you remember, right? Whoever has the most followers, that means in this challenge, that person... Is the winner. - Smart one. - [CHUCKLES] - Here's your drink. - What? Okay. And for you both today... [IN ENGLISH] On the house. [IN ENGLISH] Thank you, Raka the barista. [CHUCKLES] - Not bad. - Special, huh? What? Special from Raka the barista. Might be soulmates. [GASPS] - Soulmate. - Sh! What soulmate? I never talk to him for more than 15 minutes. That already includes ordering coffee. Dear, a soulmate can start with small things like this. Enjoy! Smile! Oh! Like this? Soulmate for every customer! Look! [SHRIEKS] [ANGGUN MOANS] Barista Raka! - What's your sign? - [MUTTERS] [MOANS] Wait, wait! The cake! [MAGICAL MUSIC] [ANGGUN] His name is Tim. My tutoring friend in middle school. Just got back from traveling, good at photography and painting. He's an artist. Last time I heard, he was preparing to travel the world for the fifth time. Ariel. Tim? [IN ENGLISH] Yup! The one and only. [CHUCKLES] Sorry. Have you been waiting? I just got out of a meeting. About my next photography project in Budapest. It's okay. No worries. Want a gallery tour? - Sure. - Come on. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Well. [ARIEL] Wow. [IMPRESSED CHUCKLE] Oh, this? This is when I swam with crocodiles in Crocosaurus Cove, Australia. And you know what? They're huge, like enormous, and it was really, really exciting. Definitely one of the most exciting experiences in my life. - [SIGHS] That's crazy. - Crazy. Crazy, really. I just said that too. Really crazy. [CHUCKLES] Anggun was right. You're sweet. Oh. This. This was me in the Dwarf Empire of China. The place was fascinating, you know. Beautiful. Very cool. I really liked it there. Oh, and this! This... was when I went rafting. In Kanali River, Nepal. And this is one of the rivers... Lo... Long... Long... - Longest? - Yes! That's right! And the most mas... - Mas... Yes! - Massive flow? The longest and the most massive flowing river. [GASPS] - Massive flow? - Massive! [CHUCKLES] Do you like to travel? Not really. [IN ENGLISH] Wait. You never thought about... traveling somewhere or doing something exciting in your life? Not really. Just normal stuff. Never? - Never. - Never ever? Why? Why? Huh? [SIGHS] Your life must be monotonous and very boring. I know. I know the furthest you have gone to. Sh! Don't tell me. Let me guess. [MAGICAL SOUND] [FINGERS CLICK] Mayestik. [CHUCKLES] The furthest you've gone must have been to Mayestik. [WHISTLES, IMPRESSED EXCLAIM] This is very cool. Do you know? Just by staring at this statue, [INHALES] - I can reach an orgasm. [SHIVERS] - Hm? - Want to see? [CHUCKLES] - Hm-mm. Just kidding. It's just a metaphor, just a figure of speech, of how awesome this statue is. Extremely perfect. Perfecto! [IN ENGLISH] Sexy! [SIGHS] The perfect statue. As perfect as me. [INHALES, EROTIC MOAN] Look at the shape. The curve of the muscles. Wow! But it's going to change. I want to change my traveling style. I've done the extremes. I want to be more relaxed now. I want to go to Budapest. I want... Listen carefully, wonderful sir, with the most perfect life, perfecto! Your life is wow! The way people live their lives is different, so don't judge how I live mine. There's no need to travel the world to make perfect statues. Anyway, perhaps you had a sad life before, huh? That's why you are like this. Redemption, huh? Yes? Poor thing. [CLICKS TONGUE] But... Oh, and now, I will go back to my life, which you said was not exciting. Enjoy your statues, Mr. Narcissistic. [STAMMERS] Capricorn guys, ambitious, super arrogant, extremely narcissistic! I can't even imagine what it will be like if I were to date Mr. T? Surely, his photos will be everywhere. On my phone, laptop, wallet, room, on the bed! Or maybe he will tattoo his face on my arm? Or even on my face? [SCREAMS] [MAGICAL MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [ANGGUN] My office mate, Iwa, has been single for three years. I don't know why because he's not that bad looking. - Handsome even! Very kind to girls. - Good evening. I'm Tamara. Ready to order? Hi, sweetie. Yes, we are ready to order. For the appetizer, I'll just have the salad. Then, the sirloin steak with mashed potatoes, medium-well. And banana split for dessert. Extra sweet, just like you. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] [CHUCKLES] How about you? [SHY CHUCKLE] Hold on. Hmm... What about soup? One cream soup for this lovely lady. BBQ shrimp or spaghetti for the main course? [SIGHS] Shrimp or spaghetti. Hmm... - Spaghetti will fill you up. - [WARPED SOUND] Okay. One spaghetti for this beautiful lady. And for dessert, chocolate lava cake. [WAITRESS] Anything else? Yes. Your phone number, if that's okay? [WARPED SOUND, WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Did you have to? Flirt with her like that? [SCOFFS] Who's flirting? I'm just trying to be friendly with her - so she will serve us even better. - Mm. Anything wrong? No. You are never wrong. [CHUCKLES] Uh, where are you going? Restroom. Oh, really? [LAUGHS] - That's how it went? - Yes. Oh my God. [GIRL GIGGLES] I didn't expect it to go like that. [GASPS] [GRUNTS] Here! Hold it! [MUSIC ENDS] According to the zodiac chart, Pisces and Pisces are the perfect match. Like two goldfish swimming in the same pool. Understand each other, support each other. But Mr. I and I are the complete opposite. From the start, I was already not into him. [IN ENGLISH] Hi, Pisces! Your intuition can be sharp, but why do you guys tend to be players? Bye. [MAGICAL SOUND] - [ANGGUN] Adam. - Passing! My neighbor's brother-in-law's cousin. Really into sports, macho, have an athletic body, have tattoos. Anyway, if you're with him, you will feel safe! - [ANGGUN] Dam! Adam! - [CHEERS] Adam! Hey! - What's up? - [ANGGUN] I'm good. What a surprise. What a surprise? [CLEARS THROAT] Oh, Adam, this is my friend. This is Ariel. The most beautiful. - I can see that. Hi. - Ariel. Adam. - Sorry, I'm sweaty. - It's okay. You're used to it. I'm going to play again, okay? Go ahead. Okay, right? Boo! Waited a while, huh? I'm sorry. [SIGHS] Thank you! - You're pretty good at futsal. - Hm? - Like Cristiano Ronaldo? - [LAUGHS] Why are you laughing? You... waited while I played futsal, watched me play futsal for a while, almost two hours. - No one is going to be angry? - [CHUCKLES] No. Why? How about you? Will anyone get angry that I'm here? No. There used to be. [CHUCKLES] Possessive ex? Do you believe in love at first sight? [CHUCKLES] - Nope. - No? You seriously don't believe in love at first sight? No. There are actually people who do not believe in first love. For me, I really believe in it because I experienced it. My first love's name was Hawa. Can you believe it? I'm Adam and my first love's name was Hawa. One heaven. Like the angels matched me with Hawa. Right? Right? [BOTH CHUCKLE] And a lot of people said that we were the perfect couple, sweet couple, best couple. And they were right. [IN ENGLISH] We were so perfect. [IN ENGLISH] Too perfect. But a week before the happiest day of my life, the day I thought would be the most historical day in my life, she just left me. No reason, no news. Didn't think about my feelings. [MOANS] Maybe your first love was not your soulmate. You're really wrong. It's obvious when everyone said my relationship was like Bonnie and Clyde, Galih and Ratna, Romeo and Juliet, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. - Upin-Ipin. - Upin-Ipin? True, true, true! [SNICKERS] But I'm a man. I have to get out of this situation. But do you think I can? Find love again? Open my heart again? Can I? True, true, true! Are you making fun of me? - No... - I'm broken. I'm heartbroken and you're making fun of me? [IN ENGLISH] Sorry. [SIGHS] [IN ENGLISH] You know what? [IN ENGLISH] I think I just need a shoulder to cry on. [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC] True, true, true. It really kills me, you know? Like... [ARIEL] When I first met Mr. A, I was pretty sure he was a tough guy because he's macho, tattooed, athletic. But when we talked, it turned out he was such a softie. Cancer guys, you guys are indeed loving, but please, move on from the past. Unstable emotions. [AGI] Usually, astrologers mark the positions of the planets with an imaginary belt in the sky that encircles the earth. That, we call it by? [BOTH] Zodiac. - Okay. - The zodiac is divided into 12 parts. Each arc is 30 degrees. Gi, you know all that because you learned it by yourself or...? Yes, I learned it by myself. Because by knowing the zodiac, I can know a person's character. - Oh, really? - Yes. - Okay, if the zodiac is Cancer? - [IN ENGLISH] Sensitive. - Taurus? - Persistent. - Aries? - Stubborn. - Scorpio? - Selfish. - Gemini? - Unstable. - Leo? - Prideful. - Virgo? - Dedicated. - Libra? - Gentle. - Sagittarius? - Supportive. - Capricorn? - Luxurious. - Aquarius? - Balanced. Pisces? Full of understanding. [BOTH LAUGH] So, you're not just describing people based on their zodiac but you judge them with only one word. [SHRIEKS] So, what do you get from knowing all that? Well, by me knowing the zodiac, I can choose the right partner for me. So, you choose a partner when their zodiac matches yours? So, what if it doesn't match? - I quit. - That's it? - Yes. - [CHUCKLES] [AGI CHUCKLES] - Why are you laughing? - It's weird. I mean, I feel like there is no exact science between the zodiac and human relationships. [LAUGHS] You must be a Sagittarius. Right? What do you think, zodiac guru? [CHUCKLES] Sagittarius. [CHUCKLES] Yes, just believe what you want. [MAGICAL SOUND] [ANGGUN] John, my ex-client. Talented young chef. You won't regret meeting him. Bright-skinned, handsome, smart, good at cooking, really cute! Table 12 ready! [JOHN] Try it. - Hmm! Delicious! - Delicious? [CHUCKLES] Oh, by the way John, do you believe in the zodiac? I don't believe in zodiac signs. Oh, really? But there are still a lot of people who believe in the zodiac. Yes. Those people must be naive. Ih. Right. [CHUCKLES] Let's assume the human population in the world today is seven billion. Let's say humans are born everywhere in the duration of 12 months. That means the number of people right now is 584 million. Now, for example, your horoscope says, "You are breaking up with your boyfriend." Are 584 million other people also breaking up with their partners? It's not possible. [LAUGHS] Yes, that's very true. Anyways, I really believe that there is no consistent zodiac forecast. And it's very easy to prove it. Just try to collect the zodiac forecasts from various sources. Definitely none of them will be the same. I guarantee that. Of course. Eh, by the way. What is your shio sign? Shio? Snake. Snake? Sorry, Riel. We don't match. My shio is monkey. [SILLY SOUND] [ARIEL] Spending time with that Mr. J almost went perfectly. We have the same thoughts on the zodiac. But it turns out he believes more in shio. Is it a problem if my shio is a snake? [HISSING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [ANGGUN] Here, your favorite, Darius. Humble, bright-skinned, neat, clean. Still like how he was in high school. The only difference is now, he's even cuter, Riel! Now, he's a contributing photographer for National Geographic. [LAUGHING AND CHATTERING] How do you do this? [CHEERING] [CHEERING] What do we get? - Hey, Riel. - Hm? Do you have a big dream? - A big dream? - Hm. Not really, because I'm the type of person who lives my life for today. - Is that so? - Hm-mm. That's unfortunate. You should have big dreams. Yes, because we humans were created to have great achievements in the world. And also to share. What is your biggest dream? To travel around the world. No, no. I don't want much. I just want a happy little family. One wife, two children. But our house will be by the river. [FEEL-GOOD MUSIC] [SOFT CHUCKLE] [PHONE PINGS] Riel, if an unknown number contacts you, just ignore it. - That's my psycho girlfriend. - [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Sorry for dragging you into this. Don't contact me again. It's true, nobody is perfect. Mr. D, the only guy in this contest who can make me fall in love, but instead... [SIGHS] [CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS] There's no prince charming in real life. [SOBS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] ANARCHY [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC] [ARIEL] Can't you just arrest him right away? It's useless for me to give information if I already know who did it, sir. We cannot. Sorry, miss. - Huh. - We can't just catch the culprit. There are procedures. Miss, If there are further developments, we will let you know. Excuse me. Thank you, sir. Ariel, what happened? It's nothing. But are you okay? [INDISTINCT SPEECH] Here, I made a special hot dog for you, still warm. Okay, just put it there. Special hot dogs? Oh, Rio really knows the right timing! Ariel is in a bad mood. Who knows, maybe your hot dog can bring Ariel's mood back! [INAUDIBLE] What are you waiting for? This is my masterpiece. So, I'm not leaving until you finish the hot dog. I'll eat it later. Now, I'm still full. Eat now. It's a masterpiece, you know? You can't say no to this. [CLICKS TONGUE] Rio. So, Ariel wants to be spoiled. She wants to be fed. Give me the hotdog, please. Open the hotdog, then just give it to Ariel. Nggun, what the hell? I don't want to! - I don't want to! - Take it easy. Oh, what's your zodiac sign? Scorpio. What about it? Compatible! Don't say that! He can get over-confident, thinking I like him. Mm, Riel? When the last hot dog ended up in the trash, I had no problem. But this one... This one is special. Special, babe! You actually want him to be here for a long time, right? You just don't want to say it. Okay, I will eat it! If I eat this, will you leave? [IN ENGLISH] Masterpiece! [SHRIEKS] [SMACKING SOUNDS] Even I want to eat it. [GASPS] And? - What's wrong with you? - [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] - [GASPS] - What's wrong? Spicy! It's spicy, you know! - Water! Water! Water! - Spicy? I didn't put chili. Or did I? Here, here. [SPITS] [ANGGUN] Rama likes to eat. He's like a walking culinary dictionary. If you go out with him, you will be taken to unexpected places. - But they all have amazing food! - Uh... Rama. Awiel. April? Alil. Air? Ariel. [CHUCKLES] Ariel. Come sit. [CHUCKLES] Uh, let's order first. Uh, miss! [RAMA SIGHS] Hm. - Mm. - The Soto Betawi here is superb. Can I have this? Lontong. - Take it. - Mm. Mm. Poor you. Did he not know that you are allergic to shrimp? - Well, he should have known. - Mm. I don't know. I want the meat! You're allergic to shrimp. - So, I will finish them. - [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] [ARIEL] Finally, I met Mr. R, the Aquarius. Pisces meeting Aquarius is like fish meeting water. The fish can swim freely in their habitat. At first, it went smoothly, just fine. Until finally, Mr. R kept eating my food. Once, twice, three times. And the climax was the last portion of fruit dessert. Um, Riel, there's only one fruit dessert left. - Let's share? - Hm-mm. [JOLLY LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC] Here. Good, good, good. If it's good, why make that face? Okay then, I'll finish it! [SHRIEKS] [ANGGUN] Tommy, a friend of a friend. A bit nerdy, but he's nice. My friend's friend that dated him said he is romantic. So romantic! It's romantic, but... but what I said is true, right? The water is so muddy, so it looks dirty. In my opinion, a place like this should be taken care of more, so people can come here and enjoy this place too. For me, if it becomes crowded, then it's not going to be fun. It's better like this, so the people who come here are those who are really looking for an ambience that is romantic, just the two of them. Right? [GASPS] [GULPS] - Good, huh? - [FAKE LAUGH] Really good. Refreshing. Riel, about the critic issue. Just imagine if you were in my position, you would be annoyed, right? Hmm... For me, it's whatever because it's not a big deal. - Huh? Not a big deal? - Hm-mm. Not a big deal, how? It may be trivial for you but not for me. They were being critical of my appearance. Saying I was not up-to-date, - how I didn't understand fashion. - [PHONE PINGS] And what made me angry was they told me to major in fashion. Might as well enroll in the culinary department, so I can fry their mouths. Makes me so angry. They cannot do this to me. Makes me so angry. They cannot do this to me. [LAUGHING] [TOMMY LAUGHS] Who are you chatting on WhatsApp with? Uh... My friend. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Huh? Why? Nothing. It's okay. If it's nothing, then why aren't you paddling? Am I your servant? What? If no one is paddling, then how do we get ashore? What? Oh my God, Tommy! [SHRIEKS] Tommy! Tommy, how could you! [SCREAMS] - Tommy, why? - Mm. - Ouch! - So good! Being ignored is really the best. [GASPS, SIGHS] Tommy! Aren't you getting off? - Huh? - No. [SIGHS] Insane. Two hours 38 minutes. Unbelievable. I would get muscular arms if every time we met, I had to row a boat. Please itu kebangetan sih. He protests too much, stubborn, sulky. [SILLY MUSIC] [ANGGUN] My follower on Instagram, his name is Dika. He is polite, fashionable, clean, neat. As a girl, even I feel like I'm messier than him. Dika? Is there something that I can help with? Just a minute. Done. Riel? Are you hungry? Hm-mm. I got this appetizer for you. Uh, hold on. Before you touch the apple, use this first. Where's your hand? - Follow me, okay? - Okay. Ariel. Get a manicure tomorrow, okay? Your nails... So, let me cut the apple, okay? Here you go, sir. Excuse me. - Is this enough? - That's enough. Oh... [CHUCKLES] Sorry. It's okay. Just a spill. [SILLY MUSIC] [SNEEZES] I'm sorry. [LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC] Here's the brownie. - Thank you. - Enjoy. I'll cut it, okay? Let me, Riel. - Let me! - Let me, Riel. - I'll do it. - I'll do it! [ARIEL] It's true! Libras are polite, romantic, intuitive, but they are also unstable and very quick to get hopeless. This time, it was my fault because the little things I did, he got upset and ignored me all day. By the way, Mr. D, the brownies were really good! - Riel! Ariel! Ariel! - [BRIGHT MUSIC] Turns out that Jupiter gets directly proportional with Mercury faster than I expected. Hi, Gi! Hello! Just got home from work? Hm-mm. Where is your office anyway? At the previous bus stop. Oh, nearby then. [INDISTINCT SOUND] How come you have this version? - Haven't you heard this version yet? - Not yet. How can you have it? Benefits of being a radio DJ. That's not fair. Then you can send it to me. [CHUCKLES] Oh, no can do. This is exclusively for me. [GASPS] Okay, very exclusive. Fine. Here, I'll send it through Bluetooth. So, according to today's rotation of the planet, now is the right time for Sagittarius to look for a partner. Oh, really? Wow. Sagittarius is compatible with Leo. Trust me. And? Like us.

If he's a jerk, then he's a jerk. [ARIEL] Why did you have to hold me back? I should've been able to teach a jerk like that a lesson! - I just... - I could've kicked his face! - It's because of you, you know! - [PENSIVE MUSIC] Enough. Why would you respond to him? Better find another smarter way. Asshole! It's because of you! You are so annoying! Separating me from a jerk like that.

You already ranked number one in the myth contest. - How did you know I entered the contest? - [LAUGHS] Well, it's not hard to find out who's first in the contest that many people are talking about now. So, how is it? After entering the contest, after a lot of research, you know Leo and Pisces don't match, right? That's just a general description of the zodiac, Gi. - I think we... - Definitely don't match. Why did you say it like that, Gi? You think we are not compatible? We're good, right? For now. The next five to ten years? We wouldn't know. [GRUNTS] We should not be together anymore, Riel. Gi, why do you say that? You don't know why I entered the contest. Do you believe in the zodiac? Ruli, he's my friend. Don't play him just to win your challenge. I didn't mean it, Gi. Ariel, thanks for the socks. I'll go now, okay? Sir, here, sir!

Yes, I know I've made a fatal mistake. Forgive me. Okay? I won't stand up until you accept me again. Why do you always embarrass me? Why? In the past, I dated a guy whose zodiac sign is Scorpio. Pisces and Scorpio are really compatible. Everything is like a fairy tale. At that time, I really believed in "happily ever after". Why don't you give me one more chance? The effort I've made so far, is it not enough? What effort? Opening a hot dog booth in front of my shop? Flirting with all the customers? Pretending to give me hot dogs every day? Since when can you cook? Since when do you like hot dogs? Since when do you care about other people? And just so you know, all the hot dogs you gave me were never great! They made me sick! Ariel!

What did he bribe you with? - No, no... - What? I'm not asking you! What did he give you? Just so you know, Anggun, you set me up with the person I hate the most! I don't know anything! Maybe when I went with David, you also set it up so he came? - Wow, that's crazy. That's ridiculous! - What? Why are you accusing me? I feel sorry for you because since you came back from Bandung, you're just stuck in the sock shop every day. Am I wrong? You're wrong! You don't need to pity me. I don't need it! Especially you! You don't have to pity me either! I don't need it! - You're always like this! - Wait! Never say anything, run away from problems, then suddenly explodes! - What's the matter really? - Ask your new best friend! - You dated Rio? - Yes! I used to date this asshole! Because of him, my life was a mess, my college education was ruined. My parents owed money here and there to pay for my college! Until finally, my shop's about to go bankrupt! Scorpio cheated with my best friend. Why didn't you tell me? Because I want to forget everything. I don't want to remember anymore, Anggun! - [SOBS] - [GENTLE MUSIC] One more thing I want to say to you! Never apologize because I will never forgive you! Alright, Riel! Wait! I can explain everything, Riel! [PENSIVE MUSIC] [PHONE RINGING] I didn't order a cake. This one is free. Good for those who are upset. [SCOFFS] Who's upset? It's unusual to see you alone today.

Dating agency? Or... Or what is it? I'm actually in a contest to prove that the zodiac and soulmates have no connection. Do you believe in the zodiac? The zodiac? I do. Really? What about soulmates? - I do. - Okay, let's say you meet someone. According to the zodiac, she suits you, but her first impression didn't give you any feeling of a connection. Do you still want to contact her or not? Yes. Why not? Okay, let's reverse it. According to the zodiac, she doesn't suit you, but you feel comfortable talking to her. You feel like you and she are compatible. Will you continue the relationship or not? [IN ENGLISH] Yes. - [IN ENGLISH] Really? - [IN ENGLISH] Yes. You're confused? Come with me. Come on.

On how much the other wants, to defend what they think is right. Feelings never lie. And sometimes coffee also needs creamer so it's not bitter, right? [ARIEL] Agi! Agi! Gi!

Uh... Ariel, uh... Do you guys know each other? Our topic tonight is about the zodiac and soulmates. What do you think? What's your view on it? I've already told you that the zodiac and our relationship have no connection! It's not an absolute trait, Gi! There are still a lot of things, Gi. Our similarities are much more than our zodiac differences. You don't feel a connection or something when you are with me? You once said to me that you believe in our relationship. Don't you want to give us one more chance, Gi? - Sir, hurry up, sir! Hurry! - Yes, sis, yes! Speed up! [LIZIA] Can I give my opinion? [ANGEL] Of course, Cip! I agree with Ariel because the zodiac does not determine a relationship, you know. - [GENTLE MUSIC] - [GASPS] Should we start over from scratch? Maybe from the wet socks moment, Gi? But... this time, no more bright colors, okay? [CHEERING AND LAUGHING] So, actually, there is no correlation between our love life... - Got you! - [SCREAMS] Agi! ...it depends on our own personalities. Okay, we're signing off... [GENTLE MUSIC] Oh yes! By the way, why did you decide not to see me again at that time? Why? Yeah. I was in love before. We dated for a year and a half. After a year and a half, I found out that she had a boyfriend. She went back to her boyfriend and left me. That's my experience with Pisces. [CHUCKLES] Agi. I'm Ariel! Not the Pisces you knew back then. We are different! Okay then. I will try to forget her. And start looking forward! [ARIEL] I think this will be my last vlog because I've managed to conquer the Leo guy's heart. Leo is extroverted, generous, and loves to laugh. He really believes in the zodiac! But don't worry. I've made him realize that love and feelings can shut down the standards that exist in the zodiac and soulmates that he believed in. The myth of the zodiac and soulmates have been shut down by me.
