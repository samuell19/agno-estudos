(rain falling) (mysterious music) (whistling) (whistling) (whistling) - Where the hell are you hiding? If you think that bed scene changed my mind, forget it! You saw the telegram yourself. My husband's arriving tomorrow. That'll really make my day. If you don't want to say goodbye to me, I couldn't give a damn. Get your things together and split. Oh Elliot, what do you think you're doing? Where'd you find that costume? Been raking through my trunks again? Oh cut out the clowning. It won't do you any good. Did you think this would last forever? Hm. That rainy night you knocked on my door. A stray dog shivering with cold. I took pity on you and you've been here two weeks. But it's all over. There's a train leaving in 20 minutes. Don't miss it. It isn't much, but it's all you're worth. What have you got in that pack? Open it. Didn't you hear what I said? Open it. (screaming) (dog barking) (rain falling) (dog howling) (papers shuffling) (items banging) (birds singing) (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (train horn blaring) (soft upbeat music) (birds singing) - Good afternoon Mrs. Miller. - Good afternoon. - Good day for a change. Bye. (birds singing) - I'll never get these drawings finished. London seems to be the only place I can work. Whenever I'm away from the rush and nervous strain, I get lazy. Maybe that's why I don't want to go back. - Give me the letter. - What letter? - You're always waiting in the garden for the postman, so I never know who writes to me. Do you think I haven't noticed? - They're all right over there, I haven't even opened them. - I saw you hiding one in your pocket. - [Ruth] You mean this one? - Give it to me. - You think it's from your father, don't you? Would you believe me if I tell you it's not from your father? - I'd rather see for myself. - If you're so mistrusting, why don't you open it? Or are you afraid? - I don't care what they say. - Forgive me Chris. Sometimes I'm not very understanding. I forget you're not well. I don't believe you ever forget. We should be closer, you and I. We only have each other. You're wrong to keep on hoping. Your father will never write to you. We'll probably never hear from him again. - He left you, not me. I know he'll write to me. (suspenseful music) (train wheels clanking) (brakes squealing) (horn blaring) (rain falling) (suspenseful music) (gasping) - You can't get over it can you? The rain still frightens you. (shutters slamming) - What did the letter say? - The last examinations didn't show much progress. But you'll recover, gradually. - Do I have to go back there? - No, this place is ideal. Orderly life, peaceful. - And boring. - You'll stay here until the autumn. Then before we go to London, we can spend a few days in Rome, Paris. Would you like that? - I should have stayed at the clinic. - Why? - I'm sure my father's gone there looking for me. (suspenseful music) - They would have told us, wouldn't they? (suspenseful music) (switch clicks) (gentle music) (rain falling) - Ruth, why do you bother about me? - Why do you think? - I really don't know. - The first time I saw you, you were only 1 O years old. You were riding behind your father on his motorbike, hugging him tight so you wouldn't fall off. If you had fallen off, he wouldn't have even noticed. Now he's let us both fall off. - He's been gone nearly a year now. Do you still think of him a lot? - You have the same eyes. The same mouth. - You must think about him a little every night. Even just to hate him. You brought me here in the hope of seeing him again. - How many times do I have to tell you, your father will never come back here. (thunder clapping) (suspenseful music) - Aren't you afraid to be alone with me? - You wouldn't hurt me. A man, maybe, but not me. Men don't love, they possess. They injure, they invade. It's always cruelty and violence with them (gentle music) Good night Chris. - Ruth? Even if I call you, don't come tonight. - Sleep well. (rain falling) (suspenseful music) (thunder clapping) (suspenseful music) (light switch clicking) (suspenseful music) - Ruth! Ruth! Please, come here! Ruth, please! Ruth, please! Ruth! Please! (crying) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (suspenseful music) - Chris. Chris. Stop it Chris. Stop it. Don't be afraid. Give me the knife, give it to me. Give it to me Chris, there's no one here but me. Give it to me. Don't be afraid, don't... It's just you and me and I'll stay with you. (breathing heavily) Rest now. I'll stay with you. Rest. (breathing heavily) (birds singing) - Good morning, how do you feel today? (dreary music) (metal clanking) (chicken clucking) Who are you? What are you doing here? I don't want tramps around my house. Pack up your things and get out of here. I said get out! - Shh (mumbles) I like to take my time waking up. - If you don't leave immediately I'll call my husband. - What are you so mad about? I haven't done any damage. Look, I got lost in the rain last night. It was late and I didn't want to bother anybody. - Do I have to call the police? - First you're gonna call your husband. Now the cops. What's up, don't you trust your husband anymore? Okay. (chicken clucking) My name's Barney Webster. Pleased to meet you. - I'll give you five minutes. (door squeaks open) (gentle music) (knocking) - Well I'll be off then. Oh, I don't suppose you called the police. - Not yet. - Look, I'm sorry if I caused you any bother. Bye. - I'm just making some coffee, do you want a cup? - Why not? Is this your house or do you rent it? - I own it. - Nice place. - If you want some ham and eggs, help yourself. - Oh thanks. - How long have you been in Spain? - Oh, four or five months, maybe six. I don't quite remember. - Where are you going? - No where in particular. Just wandering around. I've come from a place where it rained a lot. They told me I'd find good weather here, so I took the first train. It's still pissing down. - What do you do? - I study anthropology. Human beings interest me. Oh, too many. (both laughing) (gentle music) - Lewis? (suspenseful music) Lewis? (suspenseful music) Lewis? (suspenseful music) Lewis? (suspenseful music) - Woo. (gasping) - Nice to see you again. - I hope you don't mind me barging in like this. I called you from the garden. - You haven't been inside my house before. - Mm mm. - What a pity. Let me show you the art collection of my ancestors. Poussin, Lorena, Valdes Leal, and here, the family jewel, Tiepolo! (laughing) You can ring this bell all clay, nobody answers. You know what servants are like these days. - Things change. Sorry. (gentle music) (horse whinnies) - I'm doing my best to keep up the stable. - How many do you have now? - Only eight and two colts. - Oh. Those are beautiful. (tongue clicking) - When I'm with them, as if my father was still alive. Meadow's the same, the horses. When I go into the house, I remember I'm alone. (gentle music) Are you going back to Switzerland? - No, not at the moment. - Have a good time. - Thanks. (horse exhales) (upbeat music) (horses galloping) (upbeat music) - That breakfast was (kissing). Do you have any help around the house? - No. Are you that exaggerated about everything? - Oh yeah. Just about. And your husband? Is he coming back soon? - Not for a while. In a foreign country without a job, how do you manage? - I'm not that bad looking am I? - No. - There's always some odd job I can turn my hand to. Maybe you can think of something I can do around here. - Maybe. - You know, I haven't had a breakfast like that in a long time. Any coffee left? You know what I thought when I first woke up and saw you in the barn? - What? - It would be great if you were thinking the same thing that I was thinking. Hey, not so many. What did you think? Were you scared? - I don't scare easily. Finished? - Mm oh yeah. And thanks. - My stepdaughter's gone riding. When she comes back, you'll be gone, understand? (gentle music) (clock ticking) (haunting music) (engines humming) (horse galloping) (mysterious music) (gentle music) (clock ticking) (thumping) - Ruth! Ruth! Ruth? Ruth. There's a man in the garden. He's chopping wood. (banging) - I told you to leave. You've had your breakfast, now get out. - How can I possibly leave after something as tasty as that? Ham and eggs were great, and the coffee. But I'm not satisfied yet. (dreadful music) - Your stepdaughter? - I don't want you around here. (wheelbarrow wheels squeaking) (mysterious music) (chickens clucking) - You know, if I ever reach a ripe old age, and find women a drag, I'm going to have a car like this. With a uniformed chauffer. (patting) - If you think you can dominate me, you're very much mistaken. - Oh you've already dominated me. I'll do anything you want me to. - I have enough problems. You have to leave. - Nobody ever comes around here. Who's gonna find out? Maybe I can help you out with a few things. (upbeat music) (mysterious music) (hollering) (laughing) - So, the hole in the roof's fixed, the gate painted, the wood chopped, and the lawn cut. Anything else? - You've done enough for today. Take it easy. - Bored? Mm. What's for dinner? (clicking) - It's getting late for you Chris. I fixed up a bed for you in the attic. I hope you'll be comfortable. - You shouldn't have bothered. I slept fine last night in the barn. - Ruth wants you in the house. Don't you Ruth? - You're tired, why don't you go to your room? - I'm not tired. - I am, very. (guitar music) Thank you Chris. - If I had to, I could take care of you. - I'm sure you could. (humming) - That song, I sang it about a thousand years ago in school. (singing in foreign language) - Have you ever noticed how erotic children's stories and songs are? - Nonsense, there's nothing erotic about that. - My father thought so. He used to act Little Red Riding Hood with the puppets. Remember? - Your father always had a flair for the absurd. - Grandma was having an affair with the wolf, but the wolf was greedy. - And seduce Red Riding Hood as well. - And then grandma killed them both. - Oh Chris please. (singing in foreign language) - What do you two women find to do stuck in a place like this? - As you can see, nothing. Ruth designs, I ride, and sunbathe. For amusement, we spy on each other, don't we Ruth? - Stop it Chris. - We wait for someone who never arrives. We don't know whether we love or hate each other. And at night-- - That's enough. Go to your room at once. - With him? Shall I go up with him? I know why you want him to stay. If you want to test me, you can! But warn him first, of the danger. (slapping) (suspenseful music) - Yeah I can see you two have a great time together. - Help me close the shutters, will you? (suspenseful music) (latches clicking) (thunder clapping) - Are these the keys for all the padlocks? - Yes. - Even a ghost couldn't escape from here. - Once several years ago, a farm worker got locked in here. When we came back the next summer, he was dead. He couldn't get out. (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (rain falling) (clock chiming) (suspenseful music) (laughing) - I can't stand you any longer, goodbye. What's all that about? - Can't you guess? A farewell note. - Your husband. - My husband. - And you read it every night. - When I met him he was traveling around Surrey with a puppet show. He already abandoned his Spanish wife. He was always a tramp. - Just like me. We have a special charm, don't we? - I taught him how to dress, how to eat, how to behave like a civilized man. Then after eight years-- - I can't stand you any longer, good bye. You didn't do a very good job on him, did you? - Men are all the same. I learned the hard way but now I know how to handle them. He left me right here, sleeping. We just made love. He took all the money he could find, credit cards, traveler's checks, but he never found what he was really looking for. I had it Well hidden. He was never very bright anyway. Are you? - I make out the best I can. - Left me alone here with his daughter. Sooner or later he'll come back for her. - And then what happens? He'll find her very much changed. Then we'll be even. (suspenseful music) Come over here. (gentle music) You're good looking, ambitious and totally immoral. - I can't complain. - My stepdaughter's attractive, isn't she? - Very. - Her bedroom door's never locked. (chuckles) - What is she trying to warn me about? - Why don't you find out for yourself. Sometimes at night when it rains, she has nightmares and she calls for me. Next time, why don't you go? - I think I'm going to amuse myself around here. - We can all amuse ourselves. (soft music) (birds chirping) (water splashing) - [Barney] Morning. - [Mailman] Morning sir. - [Chris] Give me those letters. Come on. (playful music) Give them to me, come on! Let me go. (gentle music) (suspenseful music) - Born born ba ba barn Barn barn ba ba barn. There's Lewis. - [Lewis] Hi there! - Hello. - Hello. (bells ringing) - [Barney] Come on, good dog. Over here (clicking tongue). Hello. - Hello. - Hey. Want some? - [Boy] No thanks. (patrons talking at once) - For a week now, but with all this rain-- - You know what we could do? On our way back, we could go a little bit out of our way and say hello to Mrs. Miller. - Would you like one of these? - Oh thanks! - Look here, press that and the drum goes, see? - Chris, that young man with you, who is he? - I'm Mrs. Miller's favorite nephew. I want to pay for these two, okay? - What do you do with these bills? Nail them down so they won't fly away? - This one's for you. - [Woman] Goodbye Chris, I'm glad you're feeling better. - Thanks. - You really want to stop by and see Mrs. Miller? - That's what we said, didn't we? (dog barking) - Hey, take care you don't fall off 'eh? - Bye. - Bye. - [Barney] Come on, let's go. - I don't want to go back to the house yet. Not until they've left. - Okay we'll walk. Let's take a look over there. (suspenseful music) - Would you mind showing me the bill that young man just gave you? (cash register ringing) (vocalizing) # Always on cloud nine # I'm livin' it up all the time - [Announcer] Many of you must have seen the show and most of you would remember this song. (vocalizing) Who could over forget Perla? (vocalizing) She was the undisputed queen of musicals in the late 50s, introducing songs which would become all time favorites. You remember this one? (vocalizing) Sadly, she is no longer with us but we can relive her moments of success and happiness. The day she opened her new country home to the public, the magnificent estate where she lived in semi-retirement toward the end of the 60s, still at the height of her popularity. Her brutal murder still unpunished has rose public indignation. Paying homage to her memory, we have presented a few of her spectacular number and songs, the great hits of her career, now savagely, brutally terminated. In a fond farewell, let us now see the number which made her world famous. Charlie. (upbeat music) I didn't really want it but the little boy insisted on giving it to me. - Well who's going to do the honors then? - [Ruth] You are, naturally. - Why me? - I can't kill an animal, it makes me sick. - You'll eat it though. - [Ruth] That's different. - It's frightened. Why don't we let it go. - Farm bred rabbits can't live wild. Might as well give it an easy death. - Well, do it. (mysterious music) (door opens) (door closes) (mysterious music) - Did I scare you? - We should always be scared. You never know when something might happen. And when it does, everything changes so suddenly. - You know, I've met quite a few girls but never anybody like you. - And Ruth? (gentle music) Why are you staying with us? It doesn't matter, the important thing is you're here. I'd like to guess what might happen. - [Ruth] Chris, is Barney with you? - No. (door closes) (horse whinnying) (adventurous music) (horse whinnying) (adventurous music) - Whoa! (laughing) (gentle music) (horse neighing) (playful music) (suspenseful music) - Let me go! (gentle music) - When I leave here, come with me. (gentle music) (gentle guitar music) If I can make it up to five, I'll get my wish. - What's that? Your guitar? Pair of boots? (gentle guitar music) Don't be upset, nobody gets what they really want. - I think I Will. - Chris, help me look for some sketches, will you? (cellar doors open) (footsteps clacking) The sketches I made about three years ago for Giselle, they should be in these folders. - [Chris] I haven't been down here for ages. (circus music) - Chris. That young man, he's just passing through. He'll be gone any day now. - Worried for yourself or for me? - We don't know anything about him. I wouldn't get too close to him if I were you. Might be dangerous for you. - I'll have to try it some day. But you're ahead of me. - Chris! - He's here because of you, you brought him into the house. He's never been in my room, yet. Have you found your sketches? - No. (rain falling) (suspenseful music) - Barney? - I'm tired, I'm going to bed. - I let you stay here on certain conditions, remember? - Yeah. - Go down to the cellar and help Chris, will you? - Help her do what? - Just help her. (exhaling) (suspenseful music) (rain splattering) - Chris? (mysterious music) Chris. (screaming) - Ruth! Ruth, come here! Please, Ruth. Ruth, help me! Help me! Ruth! Please Ruth, help me! (china breaking) Ruth! Please, please! Help Ruth! (banging) Come here Ruth! (items crashing) (suspenseful music) (breathing heavily) (screaming) (banging) (thunder rolling) (gentle music) (crashing) - Get out! Get out of here, do you hear me? Take your things and leave! - What the hell do you think you're doing? What did you expect to happen anyway? You know she tried to stick me with a chisel then she fainted! - Now leave, I mean it! - Where do I go? It's raining. - [Ruth] Now, get out! - You're joking. You said I drove you crazy. - Get out! (gun fires) Get out! Get out! - Okay, I'm going. (rain falling) You crazy old bitch! (glass breaking) I felt like changing your bed! (rain falling) (glass breaking) Try screwing someone your own age next time! (glass breaking) You're the worst lay I've ever had anyway. It's no wonder your husband left you! I hope you fucking well rot in there. (gentle music) - Chris. Chris? He's gone. We're alone together again. (rain falling) (mysterious music) (footsteps) (mysterious music) (thunder clapping) (suspenseful music) - Pedro, it's your turn. I left the light on for you. - [Pedro] All right. - Tin, are you in bed? - Yes. (dog whining) (suspenseful music) - Have you spoken to Maria? - No. - So they said nothing to you? - Who? - Pedro and Maria. They want to go away this summer. - [Girl] Good night. - Good night. - Good night dear. (suspenseful music) (thunder rolling) (suspenseful music) - There's a monk outside. - How many times have I told you not to open the door without knocking? - He's a big tall monk, he's soaking wet. - Well tell him to come in out of the rain. - Should I open the door for a monk? - A monk? Why of course, you can't leave a poor man standing out in the rain. (suspenseful music) - A window must have blown open. (suspenseful music) (choking) - My God, Ernesto! Ernesto! (suspenseful music) - Did you hear that? - Dad? (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (toy drum beating) (suspenseful music) (siren blaring) (dog whining) - Commissioner, how many victims were there? - Five, the entire family. - Within two years, six similar crimes have been committed within a radius of 100 kilometers. Do you think these crimes were committed by the same person? - There's no doubt about it. The killer has to be right here in this town. - What makes you say that? - Because several bills have been passed that have a cut in the center and blood has been found on them. - Is there any truth to the rumor that you've ordered a roundup of all young vagrants with packs and guitars? - A beggar with a pack and guitar was spotted near the site of all the crimes. We've already made more than 200 arrests but I don't anticipate any positive results. - [Announcer] Our mobile camera teams have been at the scene of the crime since yesterday. The commissioner who has taken personal charge of the investigation was interviewed by special reporters. - Within two years, six similar killings have taken places within a radius of 100 kilometers. Do you think these crimes were committed by the same person? - There's no doubt about it. The killer has to be right here in this town. - [TV Announcer] The commissioner's statement is obviously of paramount importance. How did he arrive at this conclusion? Here is his reply. - A vagrant with a pack and guitar was spotted near the site of all the crimes. - [TV Announcer] Nevertheless, the commissioner later stated that despite the numerous arrests of suspicious individuals, no positive results have for the moment been obtained. Another detail which may be significant, is that the dog, the family pet, waits in vain for the return of his master, raised no alarm nor frightened off the criminal. - [Radio Announcer] Could this mean that the murderer was a member of the family circle or friends of the victims known are familiar to the dog? (bell ringing) In any event, the farmhouse murders, as it is now called, occupies a focal point in the national interest. The entire country is deeply moved and outraged by this bloody, almost unprecedented crime. - [Announcer] One of the farm workers raised the alarm and immediately the police and ambulance services were alerted. Our cameras were present to provide graphic testimony of the tragedy. The images are sufficiently eloquent of the pathos of the scene. Let us now here the declarations of the commissioner in charge of the investigation. - [Interviewer] And the motive? - Money. The criminal could be content with robbery, but death excites him. He's no longer able to resist the urge to kill and he'll continue to do so. (rain falling) - [Radio Announcer] ls the killer insane? This is a question many people must be asking. (banging) Earlier this region where similar crimes have been committed but throughout the country. Let us now listen to the opinion of an expert, Professor Gordon. - [Professor] He is not exactly insane. When he is captured, I'm sure we shall find his difficult case of chromosome abnormality. The duplication of chromosome Y creates a criminal tendency. The Boston Strangler was a double Y, so is Manson and the student who machine gunned his classmates on a university campus. (mysterious music) - Don't think about it anymore, he's far away by now. - Yes, he asked me to go away with him. - Poor Chris. - He was like any other man. Perhaps we are all capable of killing. - Get some rest. Do you want me to keep you company? - No. Goodnight, Ruth. (door closes) (mysterious music) (thunder clapping) (mysterious music) (cellar door creaking) (thunder rolling) (mysterious music) (keys rattling) (gun clanks) (phone cord snaps) (mysterious music) (keys clanking) (mysterious music) (door closes) - What's the matter? - Keep quiet. - He's come back, he's in the house. - What? - We're locked in with him. Everything's locked, the windows, the doors. Shh. (safe clanking) (mysterious music) He's in the library. He padlocked all the windows. There must be some way out. - But is he-- - Chris, there's one chance. I want you to go down. - Me? - You must bring him up here. - But I can't. You know Ruth I can't. - You have to, I wouldn't ask you to if there were any other way. While he's here maybe I can find help, get away to escape. - I knew it! You've always wanted to destroy me. Destroy me to get back at my father. - He's insane, he'll kill both of us. Do you want to die? - Yes, yes, yes! - Don't make any noise. He's insane, don't you understand? Completely insane. He'll do what he wants to with you, even if you resist, and then he'll kill you. Remember what he did at the farm. You've got to pray for time. For God sake, don't let him know you suspect anything. (books crashing) (couch ripping) (door closing) (starry music) - From the first time I saw you, I thought about making love to you. (romantic music) (door closes) Chris? Chris? Ruth? - I suppose she's asleep. Why did you come back? - To steal from her. And for you. - You went away. Even though you promised to take me with you. (gentle music) - Don't be afraid. It's alright. (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (receiver slamming) (mysterious music) (moaning) (suspenseful music) (breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screeching music) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (mysterious music) - It's all over Chris. Do you hear me? It's over now. We have to tell the police. He attacked us, it was self defense. Chris? He attacked us, remember? He attacked us. I have to get the keys. (knife clanks) (ghostly music) Open the gate while I get the car. (rain falling) (people chattering) (engine roaring) (people chattering) - They've got the killer, he's been caught. (people yelling) (horses whinnying) (mysterious music) (horses whinnying) (horns honking) (people talking, horns honking) (people screaming) - Why are they acting like that? I needed money to take care of my horses. - Go on. (siren wailing) (horns honking, people yelling) (mysterious music) - Then who have we killed? - And for what? (mysterious music) - He'd just been released from prison. (mysterious music) He knew your father. Now I understand everything. He sent him. - Perhaps he came looking for me. - He didn't come for you, he came for this. You didn't mean a thing to him. He'd have left you rotting in the clinic without lifting a finger. - He wanted me to go away with him, perhaps he really wanted to. - You know what he wanted, they always want the same thing. Always. - Ruth. I think I will go away. - Where? - No place special. But here it rains too much. I don't want to stay with you. - But you're not well. Who'll take care of you? You need me. - You've won Ruth, you've beaten me. - Don't say that Chris, please. Please don't ever say that. Your father hurt me terribly. You don't know how I came to hate him. It's true. I wanted to corrupt you, destroy you, it was the only way I could get even with him. But now, Chris, I don't even hate him anymore. I feel so lonely Chris. I need you. I need you more than you need me. - Always was for you. - Chris, we killed a man. The two of us, we killed a man. - I'll try not to suffer for that. I promise you. - If you leave me, I'll go to the police, I'll tell them everything. - You won't and you know it. - Chris, I couldn't stand to be alone. Please don't leave. Please don't. - It would be amusing if after all I turned out to be the stronger. - What do we do with him? - We must wait until nightfall. (owl hooting) (breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (breathing heavily) - You think they'll notice anything? - We'll know, soon enough. (mysterious music) (trunk closes) (mysterious music) (car revving) (mysterious music) (engine roaring) (sand sliding) (water splashing) (birds chirping) (mysterious music) (brakes squeaking) - [Man] All right, come on you guys. They're peas! How in the hell can they grow here? Look at that, right up through the pavement. They get no light. The road has sunk. (suspenseful music) (motorcycle engine revving) (suspenseful music) (engine whirring) (suspenseful music)
