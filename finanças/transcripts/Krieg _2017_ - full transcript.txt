WAR Hello? Hello? Dog! Talk him out of it. Chris is an adult. Let's not forget that. What's that supposed to mean? Well... - You won't get kids psyched about that. - Well, it wasn't a hit. So next time we'll go to a miniature-golf court or... ...to the movies for our class outing. Are you going to say something about it? Chris, Arnold and I don't agree with your plans. We've accepted that you quit your apprenticeship and joined the army, even though Arnold was a conscientious objector and we both oppose war. So do I! I still do. Without soldiers there wouldn't be less war but more. That's logical. Right, Dad? Mom's right. In a way ... we just can't figure the whole thing out. I know you're a pacifist. - Yes, I am! And with good reason. - I'm against war too. But I think it's important for Chris to do what's important to him. This is not about our fear. Let me make a suggestion. I'll come to Dortmund in a few days, we'll have a beer after hours and then we'll talk about all this, okay? Not okay, I'm afraid. I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll look after myself. Do you have a cigarette for me too? - But you don't smoke. - I'm starting today. But I won't inhale. And I'll quit when you get back. Thank you. I'll leave you to it. Sorry about earlier. If I had a son, I'd probably react the same way. - But what ... What's your life to do with that bit of desert they're sending you to? What? Do you know what's going on down there? Have you gone into it at all? The politics and stuff? Stop being a schoolmaster. Maybe I'm being naive, but then that's how it is. It's no big deal. We'll all go on living the way we did. It's not like I'm leaving the planet. Yeah ... Come on, Dog! Up there? The old sculptor's hut? Are you the new owner? There's a funny character hanging around there. - Oh? Funny, how? It's not up to me to say. Maybe it's nothing. I'll register your complaint. Excuse me ... No complaint. Sorry, I just wanted to let you know. Yes. Good. That was all. Goodbye. Bye. Come on! Come on! Dog! Come on! Stay, stay! How about Italy? Spending the autumn holidays in Lucca, Florence or Venice would be nice, right? What? Venice! Huh? I can't hear what you're saying. You silly romantic! I'll have a bath and then I'll take the dog out. - It's raining. - So? Won't you look at the photos Chris sent? - I don't want to see him as a soldier. I don't want to hear about this war. Stop bothering me with it. Come on, Dog. Hi, Dad. I never knew war could be this boring. Roettger says maybe the bearded guys are on holiday just now. Incidentally, Roettger plays volleyball too. He made the photo. He says hello. We've calculated how much longer it will go on, this "serving the country." Three months and ten days. "If we sleep for 16 hours a day, the days last half as long," Roettger says. Say hi to Mom. I know she doesn't want to see the photo. Dog? Dog! Dog! It's alright. It's alright. Oh, God. Looks like a bolt. - A bolt? Fired from a nail gun or a crossbow. Plenty of crazy people around who enjoy something like that. Animal abusers. The bolt's probably infected the wound. He'll get blood poisoning. I don't think he'll make it. He should be put down. - It's your job to keep the dog alive. - I know what my job is. - So do it! Blood poisoning isn't lethal. For a dog it is. Very well. Wait outside. Oh, no, just look at these trees! I wish I had their worries. It's only for four months, Karen. Four months. Chris will come back safe. How would you know? I just do. You've worn rose-tinted glasses ever since I've known you. Hello. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I'm on a hike. - Hello. Have you been living here long? No. Do you know who owned the hut before you? - An old sculptor. Can I come along with you for a bit? - What's the old sculptor's name? - Peter Reinhardt. - Peter Reinhardt ... - Yes. One day he died in his bed. A heart attack. His daughter told me. Peter Reinhardt, I've heard of him. I run a small gallery. Nothing important. Arts and crafts. I took over from my father. But it's very quiet this time of year. Is someone living there too? It's the old diner. It's empty. This old sculptor, Peter Reinhardt, did he move to the mountains to die? Possibly. - Are you the only escapist living here? - I think so. Why? - Would you like something to drink? - No, thanks. I'll just step out for a sec. - Can you cope with that? - Careful you don't slip. Hidden chasms. I know. Dog! Hi, Dad. Roettger's dead. He stepped on a mine. Then they amputated one of his legs. The other couldn't have been saved either. Then, a week ago, he was flown back to Germany. He went into the garage in his wheelchair and let the engine of his Fiat run. He'd planned to drive it to Italy after our mission, so it could see its old home again. Our captain said Roettger felt abandoned by everyone at home. Apparently some politician said on TV that soldiers are themselves to blame if they get their legs shot off. It's all crap, Dad. Hello, Darling. Well, did you arrive safely? So how's Andrea? God, that sister of yours! Yes, everything's fine at school. The ringing in my ear's getting worse. No, it'll go away by itself, won't it? Yes, I have heard from Chris. He's fine. Sends his love. No, everything's fine. I miss you so much. Even the dog. Yes, I'm in bed already. Yes, I'll be thinking about you. You sleep well too. Bye. Roettger wrote in his will, that no politician may speak at his funeral. Don't tell Mom about Roettger. Sandra doesn't know either. Two months and 22 days to go. Yours, Chris. What happened? I slipped. - Are you okay? - Yes, I ... have to see to the dog. What's wrong with him? Nothing. I'll be off then. Yes, everything's fine. Everything's fine. Bang ... you're dead. - Who was that? - Who? That guy just now. - Many people come here. Hikers, holidaymakers ... - But that one was a funny character. - Funny, how? - Disheveled and smelly. - Howdy! - I'd like a knife, please. With pleasure. For yourself? No, for my son. What's his name? Why? It's just that we offer free engraving on the handle ... - I don't want that. ... of the owner's name. Just so you won't say you didn't know later on. - Could I have a look at that one? - Certainly. If you could just tell me what your son needs the knife for. Hunting. Yes ... It was nothing. There was a big military funeral at the Northern Cemetery in Cologne today. Earlier the Defense Ministry strongly condemned the attack, that left two German soldiers dead. The State Secretary of Defense offered his condolences to the next of kin ... - Did you hear that? - I wasn't listening. The two dead soldiers, how did it happen? Chris is clever. He can look after himself. Maybe during a volleyball game? They're unarmed then! You said they play practically every afternoon. Maybe they didn't put enough sandbags round the court or ... Did they say how it happened? No, and it doesn't concern us. It's not where Chris is based. Go get ready, they'll be here in half an hour. You think I'm dreadful. No. I don't. God ... I think you're wonderful. I just thought it'd be nice to go out with Martin and Astrid again. - Yes ... Yes, you're right. But you are telling me the truth? Or do you leave out half of it, so I won't get upset? Arnold Stein? Martin, yes? I'm sorry. No, goes without saying. Tell her to get well soon. Karen says hi. Fine, okay. Take care, right? Bye. Astrid has a back pain. Lumbago! She has them all the time. Too little exercise. - Okay, in that case I'll let the dog out. - Great. I'll join you. Don't get upset, but I'd really rather go on my own, okay? Come on! Why don't you read Chris's mails yourself? We have no secrets. The two dead soldiers were in their early twenties. Just like Chris. Neither of them was Chris. God, Karen, nothing will happen to the boy. I know. Yes. Come on! Hey, good morning! Look, here. Yeah ... Another bit? Do you want another bit? The strong defeats the weak! That's how it is in war! Come on. Yes. Everything will be alright. You see? Everything'll be alright. Yes, it will. Karen ... at least try the tomato sauce. It's your recipe. Balsamic vinegar, a little sugar ... Thank you. - I'm going back to work next week. Good. That's ... That's good, I'm glad. God, this sauce is good. Isn't it? It's great. Yes. You've outdone yourself. Honestly. I put in some more basil. It's good, isn't it? It is. Listen, I'm just going out for a bit. Seeing Sandra. Have a drink. Really very good. Hi, Dad. The bearded men have started dressing up as soldiers or police officers. Yesterday a police officer threw a bomb in the market square. Everything was covered in blood. There was a boy with both arms missing. He was lying face down in the dirt as if he wanted to kiss the dust before he died. It's crazy und fucked up here. We try to save the kids and when they turn 15 they're given a gun and they shoot us. Some things you just can't understand. I hope we can finally get it to stop. Even if it's going to be fucking hard. I'm not mailing Sandra about all this crap. Wouldn't be good for Mom either. Tell her I'm doing fine. I'm so bored. By the way, we won the volleyball tournament. Love, Chris. Sandra, hello. Oh, no. Please, no. Leave me. No, leave me be, please. It's been here all week. Sorry. A common mistake for people who use general delivery, not checking regularly. - I'll remember that. - Want to take your 200 euros as well? It's why I'm here. - I was just asking. Seeing it's not Saturday today. 10 ... plus 20 makes 30, 50, 100, 150, 200. There you are. - Is your dog sick? - He's getting better. Someone's been asking about you. She's looking for someone. You know her? Anne? Residing in the Sport Hotel? "Lonely Her looking for lonely Him ..."? No. Thanks. - Ciao. - Ciao. Bye. Hello? Hello? Hello! So, how did it go? - I'd forgotten how loud it can get in a schoolyard. Luckily the holidays are coming up. Listen, what would you say to a cruise? A cruise? - Yes! Why not? Very sealed off, somehow. Exactly. What? No. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hi, Dad. Last night one of the guys thought he was going to croak. Some of them are so scared their voices sound like those of angels. But it's our damn job, after all. We stick together. The worst part are the dreams. Now for the unpleasant part, Dad. I shot one of those bearded men. "It's been a few days since it happened. I wasn't sure, if I should tell you. He fired an RPG at our armored Dingo. He came to check, if he'd hit us." That was the good news, now for the bad news: the weather. The avalanche situation will not improve, so the critical warning level 4 will be maintained for the whole broadcasting area... Come on, boy. Come on! What's wrong? Yeah, like I thought. Sepsis. The wound's infected. Maybe he'll make it, but I can't make any promises. Is there anything I can do for him? You can repent of your low opinion of the Lord and pray for your dog. That's what you can do. This is just what I prophesized. Leave him here with me for now. Great to see you. Yes. Thanks. A coffee and a mineral water, please. Same for you? Yes, please. So? Do you like it here up in the mountains? - Yes. The dog's fine? He's fine. And you? How are you? Fine. I still think a lot about Chris. Now no one calls me "Baby" anymore. It actually annoyed me, because he was really very shy, but ... We almost didn't meet. You know the story? Tell me about it. We met at the movies. Chris didn't have the courage to talk to me and ... So the next day I went to see the same film again, and he was there too. A good beginning for a love story, right? - Yes. During our final night he told me something beautif... Do you want to hear it? - Yes, of course. Tell me. Thank you. Thank you. He said, "Baby ... I don't want anyone to kill you and me with a single bullet at the same time." Yes. Sounds like Chris. - Yes. I kept telling myself nothing would happen to him. We all did. But you go to war to kill. Both sides do. Chris knew that. And we did too. During our final night Chris asked me to promise him something. I haven't told anyone yet. He wanted me to find someone else if he failed to return. And ... now you've found someone else? Yes. I ... I wanted to ask you, if you have any objections. I know I don't have to ask for your permission, but ... I want to. No. Howdy! You're on the road early. - What happened to your car? Can't hide anything from you! The tow guy says he pulled it up a hillside. Do you drink? Probably forgot to put on the handbrake and parked it too close to the brink. First your hut gets burgled, then your dog gets shot and now the car. Be careful your hut doesn't burn down. I'll keep my eyes peeled. Your dog's doing better. The vet told me to tell you. After the sculptor died the hut was empty for ages. Can't tell you exactly how long. The old man used to own a gun. Did his daughter take it with her? I only dealt with the estate agent. I bought it the way it was. Not bad. If you can afford it. I'd love to do that, leave everything behind. Nonsense. I'm from here. Then I went to the police academy in Linz and now I'm back. Nothing much going on here. So you need to have a fertile imagination, you know? Yes. What made you end up here? Let's just say ... life itself. Yes, look who it is! Come on, boy! I have to go. Do you want me to send you a bill, or will you pay cash? Sick animals aren't cheap. Is that enough as a down payment? Come on. Come on, get away! Come on. Come on, get out. By the way, Dad, I read that 90 percent of the people have no clue why we're here. That's why they don't give a shit when one of us dies. I can't wait to finally see you again. - What are you doing there? 42 days left. Tell mom everything's great. Chris. Why are you doing this to us? Chris had nothing to do with this war. We all have nothing to do with this war. No one can win this war anyway. I ... want to understand. I wonder if it was just curiosity. It must have been part of it. But ... there was something in him too. Come on, eat! Hello! I ... wanted to say goodbye. I'm going home tomorrow. Can I come in? Doesn't the darkness scare you? No. Whom were you waiting for? I don't know. May I show you something? He moved out of our apartment overnight. He quit his job and was suddenly gone. Then suddenly, six months ago, this postcard arrived. Just his regards, nothing else. I'd finished with him by then, really, but now I felt I had to help him. With money or whatever he needed. Nothing more. You don't know him, do you? What makes you think so? No idea. He sent the postcard from this place. I heard a tent was on fire down here. A man had been living in it. Do you know anything about that? No. That's why you came. You thought I was him. Thank you. Stop drinking, please, okay? For me. Do you think there'd be a point? It could be a new start. For us? Without Chris? Yes. Thanks for waiting for me. - I'm just waiting for the boss. It's good anyway. Saves me having to go up to your place. Did you see the fire? What fire? - Last night. At the diner. Not much left of it now. - I don't know anything about a fire. I was asleep. - Did you have a visitor? Why ask, if you know? Who'd start a fire like that? Do you have a suspicion? No. The woman who was with you... - ...she's looking for her ex-husband. - Yes, she told me. - And? - She didn't find him. There was someone in there. In the old diner. We found stuff... - ...of someone who had no business there. - What stuff? I'm not at liberty to tell you. Apart from this here. The vet tells me your dog was shot with one of these. Could very well be. - Wanna know what happened to the guy? He jumped out the window before his ass got burned. You know who he is. I know that. In case you want to tell me something after all... ...get in touch. The police can do more than you think. Karen? What do you want? Who are you? What do you want?
