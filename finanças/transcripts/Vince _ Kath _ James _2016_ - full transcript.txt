BRO, WHERE ARE YOU? YOU MIGHT MISS THE SHOW. Girl, hurry up. They're about to announce the winner. I'm coming. -Look at that contestant. -I know, right? -Bro. -Hi, idol. Sorry, bro. -One. -Where are you? Mom's been looking for you. You promised to come home early. -Bro, how are you? -I'm OK. I reserved these seats for you. ...crown for the night. Contestant number 3... Are there any nice chicks? There you go again. That's all you ever think about. Of course! Why else would I be here? Who's your bet? Raise that up! Cheer for her. You're really my idol, Kath. #DAVINCIQUOTE: CRUSH; NOUN. IN OTHER WORDS - YOU. Thank you so much. I hope I remember all the tips you gave me. Aunt. -Vince! -My aunt is so sexy. My mommy is so beautiful tonight. Smells good, too. Don't tell me you went to a practice game again. When will you quit the varsity team? -And you know, which reminds me, your-- -You cooked a lot of food. -What's the occasion? -Oh, we had a party for the employees in the manpower agency. -Of course I had to prepare... -Right. Your grade report arrived earlier. You flunked again. We'll talk later. Later? Why not now? Son, this is what I have been telling you. When are you going to focus on your studies? Look at Vince. Or your sister Jamie. They have plans for their lives. Mom, they said I won't fail as long as I attend summer classes. -So we have to pay for your summer-- -Aunt. Your wrinkles are ruining your makeup. -Let's talk, James. -Let's just eat. Come on. There! Healthy food. Son, have dinner at least. For a sexier and prettier you. I'm so tired. Sir, please, open the trunk. Kath. -Yes? -Maxine, did I forget anything in there? Let me check. Nothing. OK, thanks. -Thanks. -Oh, wait! Hold on. Sorry, sometimes my brain gets stuck buffering. Of all the things I could forget! What? I forgot to congratulate you. Thank you, Maxine. You know, your entrance was the best. -And I did great with your hairdo. -Maxine. Thank you. -It's nothing. Don't mention it. -Thank you. Kyle! Bring me that! I need to pee. Mom, I'll do it. -That door's broken, Mom. -It's been broken for a week. I'll fix it tomorrow. If we don't fix it properly soon, it'll be completely broken. I don't know which god to ask for money to fix it. -There, Mom. -Thank you. My goodness. -Wow! My sister is so pretty. -Really? -You look like a beauty queen. -Really? Whatever. Let me help you with that. He didn't even send us money. Your father shouldn't have left us. Who's going to fix things in this house? I don't know how to divide my... Oh, my! My daughter won. Maxine taught me everything I needed to know. All the poses, like this! Of course I won. And I used your makeup. See, I look like a beauty queen. What are you saying? You're naturally beautiful. You got that from me. Wow. Bring these to school tomorrow. -Sell these there. -OK. Then we can pay for our electricity bill. Wait, Mom. I'll give you something. Here, Mom. This isn't much, but it can help with our expenses. I won a scholarship, too. You don't have to pay for anything next semester. My daughter is amazing. Your father will be sorry for leaving us. Dad is all that mom talks about. That's true. -Let's eat, Mom. -Let's eat. CONGRATULATIONS, CLASSMATE. YOU'RE SO PRETTY HERE. YOU'VE BEEN MY CRUSH FOR SO LONG. CAN WE BE FRIENDS? -CAN I ASK FOR A DATE? -CONGRATS. YOU'RE MY IDOL, YOU'RE SUPER GORGEOUS. YOU'RE AWESOME, CONGRATS! YOU'VE BEEN MY CRUSH FOR SO LONG. CAN WE BE FRIENDS? -Bro. -Yes? Thank you. You're the best cousin in the world. High five. Thank you. My stomach hurts because of your mom's salad cream. So, let's just eat the food your mom sent you. -Thanks. -Thanks? You have to pay me for those. I'll pay you. But you have to do my thesis for me this summer. -There you go again. -I need to focus on basketball. The coach will be selecting the players for the A Team this coming inter-university games. So, I need to be the best. There you go again. We'll get in trouble. How about... I give you my thesis from last year to use as a guide. And I'll help you in your research. Sound good? Wait. I want to ask you something. Do you know the name of Ms. Engineering? YOU WERE JUST MY HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATE. NOW YOU'RE MS. ENGINEERING. You're here. What class was this? That was my first year. Machine Design class. Bro, she's really pretty. She's my type. James? I need to reply. HI JAMES, THANK YOU FOR... HI, JAMES! THANK YOU. What happened? Kyle! Did you turn off the Wi-Fi? We ran out of data. Nice! Good job. You guys are great! OK! Hi, Coach. Did you get your clearance form signed? I'm sure most of the professors have left already. Bro, the coach will kill me if I leave practice. Your mom will kill you if you don't get cleared for summer classes. Have you printed all your requirements? -I haven't printed them out yet. -There we go! So, I'll have them printed? I'll do it? -You're always like this. -Please, just do it. They're in there. In the pocket. There. Thanks, bro! I love you. Ms. Engineering, go ahead. No, you got here first. Stay there. Hey, bro! How are you? You're going to Boracay! How fun. OK! Enjoy. -Sure. -OK. Hello. You know, you never let a day pass without pissing me off. You posted an ugly photo of me, and now you have the nerve to say, "Hi." There you go again. We're on our last semester, guys. Can you not stop fighting? Your friend is the one who's always picking a fight. You should always smile. It's really fun to talk to you. Hi, snob. Guys, I'm sorry. The printer's not working again. Please, wait a little longer. Ms. Jen! It's broken? Want me to fix it? Vince! Yes, please! Let's use your electrical engineering skills. Do you need to print something? Give it to me. -Thanks, Ms. Jen. -Hey. There's a line. Didn't you see the long line? I forgot that there's a line. Can you not cut in line? We've been here for hours already. What are you, a VIP? Why are you getting mad at me? Get mad at-- Because it's hot and it's unfair. So you stay there! Kath, calm down. He's going to fix the-- No, Maxine. He can't do that. OK. How about this? -I'll tell her to print yours after mine. -That's not my point. Ms. Jen, can you print Ms. Engineering's files next? Her face is about to explode from anger. OK? There. Problem solved. Give me your USB. You pervert. -Come! Let's just print somewhere else. -Hurry. Archie, I need a new battery. Here. Thanks. Maxine. Maxine! -Maxine. -Oh! Pokémon. Maxine, read this! Come on. Oh my God, Kath! What a lovely encounter. Imagine, you punched him and he still messaged you? There's no other man like him in the world. So reply! Go. Hey! Why did you delete it? What do you want me to say? "How's your jaw?" Or, "James, don't worry. I punch all my crushes. My punch means I love you." Wait! You're talking too much. You can just say "Hi." "Hello." -With an emoji or something. -This is all Vince's fault. He is so annoying. If I see him at internship, I don't know what I'll do to him. Calm down, Kath. -Give me his number. -OK. I'll send a group message. -Maxine's here again. -Hi, Uncle. -Hi, Uncle! I just accompanied Kath here. -What? Oh, hello. Here you go. Put it on your cheek. Kath punches hard, bro. -I think she punches harder than you. -Not true. And she's not responding to my texts. How will I court her? Hey! Klinton. You're almost eating your date. She's not just my date. She's my girlfriend. Thank you, bro. -OK. -He's nice. He'll take care of you. Why is Klinton thanking you? I introduced him to his girlfriend, Daniela. -The girl he's with? -Yes. Really? How? I taught him what to say, what to do. Just some strategies from DaVinciQuotes. -Your blog? -Yes. I thought you'd deleted that already. Nope. Let's go. Help me with Kath. What? Yes. Why? Dude, you can do it alone. You helped Klinton, but you're refusing to help your best friend? Come on, man. Do you see this? -Yes. -This isn't the only place I got hit. I got hit here, too. -Your brain got hit, too. -Come on! I'm serious. Bro, I like her. So, are you going to help me or not? Fist bump. Fine. Come! I'll buy you food. #DAVINCEQUOTE: BRIDGE? A PLACE, NOT A PERSON. Hey. What happened to you? I had him circumcised for free. Who else is going to take care of that besides me, a single parent? Anyway, I'm going to leave before it rains. -Take care of your brother. -OK, Mom. Take care. -Take care. -Bye. #DAVINCEQUOTE: BRIDGE? A PLACE, NOT A PERSON. There. What's this? Didn't I tell you I'd pay you? That's my payment. They're all yours. Thanks! I have new shoes. And because of that, you'll help me with Kath. Check this out. "Hello! Can we be textmates?" What is this, preschool? That's corny! Think of something else. That's why I need your help. I don't know how to court girls. Girls court me, bro. -Wow. -Yes. If I do this, girls come running. Especially if I do this. Three points. Look at that. Seriously though, I'm sure Kath thinks I'm a playboy. Because I'm a jock. That's why she doesn't respond. I look like a playboy, but I'm not a playboy. There. Nice. Send it. What? Don't you have hands? You send it! I already typed it. Just press send. You can type but you can't send? -Do it. -Come on! Send it. Just keep on texting her. When she agrees to meet up, I'll take it from there. HI, KATH! THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING. PLEASE, NOTICE ME. YOU'RE MY CRUSH. Sis. Brother? Kyle? Sis! It hurts. What happened? -It hurts. -What hurts? -It. -What? -My birdie. -What happened to your birdie? -It hurts. -Let me see. -No! I don't want to. -Why not? -Why? -I'm a big boy. How can I help you if I can't see it? Let me see. -I don't want to. -Just a peek! I'll just peek. What happened to it? Breathe! Open it. It hurts so bad. It's not here. Where's your medicine? Let me search online. Don't panic! Hold on. Newly circumcised. Wait. I don't have unlimited data anymore. Maxine! I'm coming. You're so slow. Let's go. FRIEND, EMERGENCY! KYLE JUST GOT CIRCUMCISED! I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. Answer her. Place your birdie here. -Does it still hurt? -Yes, so much! -Let's see. -What does it say? Warm bath. Here it is! -Time to swim. -Let's go! How do you feel? Does it still hurt? I feel a little better now. Really? Let me see. -Sis. -Just a peek. I don't want to. I'm a big boy now. Kyle, you're only 11 years old. I'm already 19. So even if you say you're a big boy now, you'll always be my baby bro forever and ever and ever. Sit there so you'll be comfortable. Are you hungry? Do you want a snack? Yes, please. Thanks. -I can do more laps than you. -I swim faster! I can beat you. You can't beat me. Hey. Wait a minute. Did she reply? There. Nice! Circumcision was all we needed. -You take care of that. -OK. Throw her some DaVinciQuotes. SO, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? Here's your sandwich. You want juice? Yes, please. CALL ME VAR. OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT SEARCH ME ON FRIENDSBOOK. YOU MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED. AH, OK, HAHA. Oh my God, Kath. -This is amazing. -Awesome. Let's take a picture. Hey! Why are you such a snob? -Schoolmates should stick together. -Go away. -Let's go, Maxine. -Wait! I'm still taking photos. Maxine, take a group selfie instead then write "#squadgoals". -Right! I'll get more likes. -No! No group selfies. Hold on. I think I need help. -Guy in orange. -Don't bother him. Let her. Let her? They're working. He can do it. You're too excited. Excited for what? Excited to show off your Ms. Engineering moves. -What moves? -This and this. And this one, too. Then you keep doing this... And your mouth is so big the microphone fits in it. -Oh, really? -Yeah. This is you, right? Yup, except that you're ugly. -I'm handsome. -OK, group picture. Mister, please include the feeds for "#feedsgoals". Closer! Perfect. Let me see. I think you'll look handsome in the picture. You too. -Such a bad day. -What bad day? You are lucky. You should be thanking God because you'll have handsome colleagues. Plus, you'll be inspired to work. Yes, I will really pray to God that I won't bump into you. Let's go, Maxine. Wait! Which filter should I use? She'll have her time. I am Engineer Joseph Javier. Head Mechanical Engineer of Tessy Feeds. This is Engineer Manuel Quinto. He's our Electrical Engineer. She's the Head of Office Operations. Good morning. I know you're grouped according to your schools. But we need to say goodbye to our schoolmates for a while, all right? Hey! Come here. Boys, follow me and Engineer Quinto to Operations. Girls, follow Merly to the office. -Where are we going again? -The office. -Let's go. -Bye. -What's your number? -Here it is. Let's be friends. you need to know the function of every button on the control panel. HI, VAR! HOW ARE YOU? -Sir. -You seem excited. Yes, I'm excited to start my internship. GOOD MORNING. WHY IS YOUR NAME VAR? BECAUSE I'M A VARSITY PLAYER. VARSITY PLAYER. I SEE. Your birdie might get sore again. -Sit there. -I'm OK, sis. AND YOU'RE CHEER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE MY CHEERLEADER. Son, I just purchased something for you... WERE YOU AT THE MS. ENGINEERING PAGEANT? Aunt, here's your salad. -That's your favorite. -You're so sweet. Kath! Is it broken again? No, Mom! It just needs water. Thank goodness. I thought I'd need to take a cab again. I was late last time. Hey, Kyle! Hurry up. What's taking you so long? All you ever think about is basketball. Now your grades look like balls. When will you focus on your studies? OF COURSE, CHEER. Who are you texting? What a nosy kid. I'm not. WASN'T THAT OBVIOUS FROM ALL THOSE BANNERS EVERYWHERE? -Please. Buy me the new model. -Aunt, come on. REALLY? THOSE WERE YOUR DOING? GEEZ! THANK YOU. Is it fixed? There! My daughter is really awesome. -Thank you. Good thing I have you. -Take care. I can't imagine my life without you. Take care! YOU DESERVE IT. I'M YOUR NO. 1 FAN. Kath, wake up, we're here. I EVEN SEARCHED FOR QUOTES JUST FOR YOU TO SAY "AKSA". AKSA? YOU'RE MINE. I'M YOURS. Come here. ME TOO!!! Today, you'll be more hands-on on machine operations. Since we're one of the top feed exporters in Asia... Always make sure that the temperature is set to 75 degrees. SERIOUSLY MESSAGE FLOODING! WHY? I JUST MISSED YOU. HEHE Do you understand? You're so beautiful, Kath. Maxine? GOOD NIGHT, CHEER. THANK YOU FOR EVERY DAY. The coach was so annoying today. I was just five minutes late. Only five minutes, but he was so angry. Don't mind him. You know that he's really eying the championship. It'll pass. Anyway, I'll go ahead. -OK, bro. -OK, bro. -Take care. -I'll just wait for my cousin. -OK. -Bro. Here's the photocopy of my old thesis. I also did some research for you. -You can finish your thesis now. -You are really awesome. Your messages to Kath were really sweet. You want to come with us? Vince and I are having dinner. I'll have to pass. I'm meeting my girlfriend. You know. OK, take care. -Let's go. -Bro. What if I introduce myself to Kath? She seems to be enjoying your texts. Come on, text her. What are you waiting for? HI, CHEER. I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER. CAN WE MEET UP? Say yes! Go! Come on. This is it! This is so exciting. -Kath. -Maxine. -I'm scared. -Why are you scared? You're not scared. You're excited! Go, send him a message. No, I don't want to. Kath, it's just a date. Come on. And if he's ugly, just text me. I'll call and pretend there's an emergency. No, that's not it. What if he's a killer? What if he's a robber? Or a scammer? You know what? I'm OK with us just being textmates. I'm not in a hurry to be in a relationship. That's not my priority. And you know that. Not your priority? Really? You're always texting him. Now you're telling me you don't want to meet up with him? Fine. What? Maxine, I'm just really scared. What if he doesn't like me? What if he finds out that I'm not a beauty queen in real life? More like a garage queen. And what if...? What if we're not compatible? You know what, Kath? You'll only find out the answers... if you say yes. Maxine. Oh! Message sent. Did she say yes already? Yes! Let's go. Let's eat! VAR, I'M ALREADY HERE AT FEELS CAFE. I'M AT THE PARKING LOT. SEE YOU! Kelvin? Janica? Thank you for being open-minded. -Yeah. Sure. -So here's my business proposal. Babe, sorry I'm late. -Have a seat, babe. -Thanks, babe. You're very handsome. Give me a kiss. One more. Cheer. You're Var? Yes, I'm Var. Good morning. Welcome to Feels Cafe. -What? -How are you feeling today, ma'am? Nervous? We don't have that here. Cheer, she's asking for your order. What's good here? Be Mine. What? Be Mine. Pasta. There. It's delicious. I think I'd like the Take It Slow Lasagna. Sure. Let's include Exclusively Dating... cookies. I think I prefer... I like sweet... I mean, sweets. But you know what's the best one? What? In A Relationship. You wanna try it? The rice meals look delicious too. The Willing To Wait rice meal. All right. Sure. Let's go with Willing To Wait. Whatever you want. So, are you going to order? Yeah. Mom, how are you? Son, why were you calling earlier? I told you I'm busy with work. Sorry, Mom. I just tried out the new phone James lent me. Your number is the only number I know. I just checked it was working. I'm sorry. By the way, Mom, my internship is near Mabalacat. I can visit you sometime. No need, Vince. Save your money instead of spending it. We're also trying to save money here. Our electricity bill is getting higher. You know, Mom, we're currently studying energy-savers. I can install one in your house. -I'll drop by after my shift-- -No need for that. Mom. Your husband still won't allow me to visit? Here we go again, Vince. We already talked about this. Didn’t we? You're there at your aunt's place so she can buy you whatever you need. Bro. Hi, Aunt! How is my beautiful aunt? Is that you, James? Why are you getting more and more handsome? I'm inspired. Anyway, my laptop's battery is almost dead. Good night, boys! Behave. -Don't stress out my sister-- -Mom. Bro. Don't mind it. If they don't want you there, we're here for you. We're brothers. What are you talking about? Whatever. Stop pretending, you're caught. So, what happened to your date? Let's not talk about it. You might get jealous. Let's hear it. I'm so happy. You know why? All the pickup lines you taught me worked. That's great. I'm happy for you. Thanks, bro. I'll go ahead. By the way, bro, can I have my phone now? I gave you a new one, right? Use that. I'll keep this for now. -But all my contacts are saved there-- -I'll return this next time. Bye. I'll be in my room. #DAVINCIQUOTE: IT ENDED EVEN BEFORE IT STARTED. Kath, you look extra happy today. Kath, tell me what happened on your date with Var who happens to be James? So? What happened? -Nothing. -What do you mean, nothing? Impossible. C'mon! Tell me. Nothing happened, OK? Tell me. I want to know every detail! Everything. What? -Fine. -So? James is Var. And? That's it. That's it? Kath, I want specific details. Did he say "I love you"? Did you kiss? What? Not yet. Come on. You're being too secretive. No kiss. -Then what? -But he said he's willing to wait. -Kath, I'm so happy for you. -Friend. -Look at him. He's snubbing us. -Who? Not in the mood? I know what it is. Haggard. You're haggard. Why? Is it tiring outside? Yes. It's really tiring in Operations. I can see that. You really look tired from documenting data there in Operations. It's tiring, but at least it's still engineering work. What about you? Is photocopying tons of documents tiring? Kath, calm down. My grandparents started out as enemies too. Whatever, Kriss Ann. This guy? I will never fall for this guy. -He's a pain in the ass! A huge one. -Wow. Why? What's your type of guy? -Someone like... James Raymundo. -Maxine. James? The varsity player? You like him? He'll never like you. He's not into guys. -Let's go. -Bye, dude. Hey! Remember we're girls... Girls. Told you you're a guy. Take care, ma'am. Gosh! The Coaster already left. This is all Ms. Merly's fault. It's OK. We can just take the bus. It's no big deal. What do you mean "no"? We're not taking the bus. -Maxine, we need to go home. -Kath. -I want to go home already. -But Baby, James. -What? -There. -Oh, my ride's here! -What's up, bro? -How are you? -Bro. Kath, this is Vince. My cousin. Your cousin? He always talks about you. Why... don't you look alike? I know. A lot of people say that I look better than him. In your dreams. Just get in. Let's go? -OK. Come on. -I'm rooting for you, babe. -Let's go. -I'll behave. Everybody... smile. Is it OK if we eat here again? Of course, James. No problem. I haven't even tried all the stalls here. -Really? -This, it's for them. Actually, James, I haven't tried all the stalls here either. Because I'm on a diet. But, today's an exception because it's my cheat day. Don't worry, Maxine. Because I know that Kath loves to eat. We'll keep coming back here until we've tasted all the food. Really? Exciting. Let me have my share. Am I really sharing iced tea with Maxine? Wow! Do you find it that disgusting? For your information, I wouldn't share drinks with you if James' varsity friends were here. -James, how is your cute coach? -Maxine. Cheer, have you ever had a boyfriend? Never. But you've already had a girlfriend, right? You're crazy. -Don't mind him. He's joking. -Yeah! I can see that. It's OK. It's really OK. Kath! Girlfriend. I knew it! She's a dude. That's me. I'm your girlfriend. Oh, yeah, right. -Am I talking too much? -Oh, no, Maxine. My cousin likes talkative girls. Especially girls who talk when their mouths are full. Like this. James, your cousin is super funny. He just likes to joke, but he's a nice guy. Bro, get our food. This one's delicious! Try it. Oh, OK. Yes, we'd like to order some ice cream? -You can go ahead, Vince. -Ah, OK. We're four, so we need three more ice creams. -And also four red velvet cupcakes. -OK, ma'am. Hey, it's going to melt. No! I'm not staring, your best friend's cheeks are just huge. It's distracting. Look at her. What? I said the ice cream is melting. What best friend? Oh... Eat it. You look like you're starving. Go ahead, eat it. #DAVINCEQUOTE: YOU WANT HIM? IN YOUR DREAMS. MY COUSIN HAD FUN TOO. Mom? Oh. You're here. Mom, what happened? The ceiling fan in my room is not working. That's why I slept here. Mom, tell me the truth. Why are you drinking? You know, the ceiling fan... would've worked properly... if only your Dad had finished installing it. Mom, that's enough. Dad had nothing to do with the ceiling fan. Forget about Dad, Mom. Didn't I tell you I'd take care of you and Kyle? We don't need Dad. I'm here. We can do this. But I love him so much. I love him. Sir, please, check this. There's a problem with the tally. -Me, sir. -Me, sir. Sir, please, pick me. -Are you sure, Ms. Gonzales? -Yes, sir! I'm sure. Hey, dude, lend a hand. Thanks! Mr. Arcilla, take care of Ms. Gonzales. What are we going to do here in Operations? I'm game. That's what we're doing. Really simple. We just have to move these ingredients upstairs. Boys! Please forgive Ms. Engineering for being slow. She moves really slow. She said she doesn't want my help. Don't worry, Kath. I'll take care of the remaining sacks. No, Klinton! It's OK. I just need to rest a little. She said she can do it. Take a break, boys. She can manage. You know Kath, it's better if you smile because-- Just go, Vince. Just go. You're too noisy. -It's irritating. -Move faster. You don't want Engineer Javier to get mad. What's happened here? -It's leaking. Let me fix it. -Hey! No! Don't. Let's call Engineer Javier. Come on. We don't need to call him. That's easy. We can do it ourselves. There's a proper way of fixing it. I know how to fix it. Let me fix it. He will get mad. I can do it. Let me. Look at what you did. You look ugly. Ugly? Ugly? -There. -Ugly. -Look. -It's disgusting, Kath. Here, handsome. Engineer-- Thank you. You saved me from Engineer "Um" Javier. It's OK. At least I don't look like, um... Yeah, right. Engineer Javier's always talking like that, "Um..." I just realized what it's like when he's angry. You don't know... um... about the machines. Um... um... Engineer... And... Did you see his face when he saw the broken pipe? He looked like he was gonna do something. He said, um... Um... What's that? That's your favorite, right? Ice cream? How did you know? It's obvious from your cheeks. That's mean. No body shaming. Celebrities wouldn't like that. Come on! Buy me ice cream, Vince. Do this first. No! I don't want to. -Come on, Vince! Please. -All right! Fine. Sit there. I'll charge this to James. -Two cones, sir. -I'll buy some, sir. What do you want? #DAVINCEQUOTE: FRIENDZONED, BUT I AM STILL HAPPY. #DAVINCEQUOTE: FRIENDZONED, BUT I AM STILL HAPPY. Oh? Why? You're a fan of DaVinciQuotes? Yes, why? -That's corny. -Say what you want! He's a great writer. He can tell a story in just six words. That's hard. You know what? Sometimes I wonder... who the author of DaVinciQuotes is. He has a lot of feelings, but he only pours them out on his blog. I feel... like I want to know him more. Comfort him. And did you know he made that blog to... To tell the girl he loves how he really feels. But he still hasn't told her. -He's afraid. What a coward. -Come on. You're a hater, but you follow him. I'm his basher. You bashers, you bash, but you still stalk them. Because he's too dramatic. Block him. Unfollow him. It's just one click. It's not that hard to click a button, Vince. One click. Hey, bro! Want a hug? What happened to you? -Why are your clothes dirty? -Killjoy. I was going to invite you out with my teammates. James, there was an accident at the factory. Vince and I were there. I didn't have extra clothes. Don't worry. It's OK. Whatever you wear, you still look pretty. Let's go. I have extra clothes in my gym bag. You can wear them. Are you enjoying yourself? Yes, super. Bros, James is here. -What's up, James? -James is here! -What’s up? -Sit down! -What's up, bro? -Hey, Vince. -How are you? -Bro. Guys, this is Kath. -Nice. -Of course. And this is my girlfriend, Pam. -You're serious about her? -Hi. Nice, dude. Dude. Yeah. -You're Miss Engineering, right? -Yes. You're prettier up close. Hey! Stop that. So, are you two an item? What's the real score? -James, you want anything? -I'm good. No, she's not my girlfriend yet. But she might be before the night ends. Nice. That's nice, bro. Thanks. Wish me luck, bro. -Are you sure about this? -Of course. -Bro. -Kath. I really like you. If you think that I'm like the other varsity players, I'm not. I stick to one. I'm serious. I'm serious about you. My bad. Kath, will you be my...? Dude! Come on. Just stay quiet there! I'll drive. I'm just reviving the engine. You were saying? Sorry. There. Go on. Will you be my...? Bro! What the hell? Can't you just sit quietly there? -I already told you to-- -James. You're my girlfriend now? Yes. #DAVINCEQUOTE: I HOPED. I'M STUPID. NEVER IMITATE. Whoo! Yes. What the...? Faster! I'm using the Expedition. -Yes, ma'am. -I'm going to BGC later. Can't I trust you with anything anymore? -Sorry, Mom. It was Vince's fault. -Vince? I'm sorry, Aunt. I was the one driving last night. I didn't see the tricycle. Gosh, Vince. That's a two-million peso car. I'm sorry, Aunt. I'll have it repaired later. -I'm really sorry. -OK. -Bye, Mom. -Mario! Let's go. Thanks, bro. Get money from my wallet. Just have it repaired. I'd like to have my car repaired. What are you doing here? Where's James? At home. I just brought James's car in for repairs. Got in an accident last night. What are you doing here? I... My uncle owns this auto repair shop. I'm just helping out. It's also a good training with machines, too. Oh, OK. So is this it? Yes. Can you see what can be done for it? -There. -You're really lucky, Vince. Do you want me to check the oil and water as well? Sure. Done. Hey. It's done. Why are you looking at me like that? -It's done? Good. -Yes. I'll tell James to have his car repaired here next time. Vince. Can we keep this a secret? Can you...? Can you not tell James? What? Why? Let's keep this a secret, please. OK. I won't tell him. -Really? -Sure. Because of that, I'll give you a discount! 1500! All-in. Where should I pay? The cashier is right over there. Hey. Over there. There. Right. Let's go. Don't worry. Engineer Javier is on his way. OK. Ms. Merly, it's our weeksary. OK. I'll leave you two alone. And we'll be having a date later. Vince! Is it OK? I'm trying to see if this kind of clothing suits me. All James' friends dress like this. And I want my date with James to be special. Does it look good? -No. -No? -No, OK. It's OK. -OK? -OK, yes. -OK. I'm giving you a chance, right. The address is written there. I hope you won't mess up this time. Um... Got it? -Yes, sir. Um. Right. -Yes. Um. Right, sir. -Good. -OK, sir. Um. OK. "Um." -Don't mess up, um, right? -Sir "Um". OK. I know where this is. Brilliant. Just brilliant. You know how to get here, but you don't know how to go back. I remember there was a terminal here. Vince, I can't be late for my date with James. I just can't. You're madly in love with my cousin, aren't you? Why? You're a transformer when you're with him. What "transformer"? Like that! All of a sudden, you're so coy. That's not the Kath I know. You talk like this when he's around: "Hi, James. There was an accident at the factory. I didn't have spare clothes. Am I right? You know what? You're the transformer. 'Cause when I'm with James, you become a "nega-tron". Is that James? James? -James? Bro. -Bro, bad news. I'm stuck at practice. The coach won't let me go. I wasn't able to attend the last practice because I attended my thesis class. I can't pick up Kath today. Please, take care of her. Bro, are you sure? Kath is really excited about seeing you. I really can't, bro. You know what the surprise is. Just go on with the plan. The coach is here, I need to hang up. I love you, bro! Bro! What did James say? He's stuck at practice. He said he's sorry. But don't worry because he'll meet us later. And I'll sub for him. -I'll take you to-- -No. It's OK, Vince. Let's just postpone it. How about we have lunch first? I know a good restaurant that serves sizzling pork. I'm sure you'll like it. The food is delicious. -Are you sure we won't get lost this time? -No, I promise. I really know the way! We won't get lost. home of the best sizzling pork here in Mabalacat. Delicious. Perfect! There's a vacant seat. Wow! This looks promising. How do you know this place? -It's because I'm awesome. -Wow, gentleman. My mom... -What? -She manages this place. -Really? -And... She's also the cook here. -No kidding? -Really! Beverly. -Oh! Hi, Vince. -Where's mom? I'm sure she's busy. Anyway, we'll get two orders of sizzling pork. And two extra of rice. I'm sure my friend will eat a lot... because the food here is good. Sizzling pork. -Got it? Thank you. -Yes, Vince. -And water, please. -Thank you. It looks delicious. You'll like the food. I'm sure. Why are you here? Mom. I told you my internship was in the area. Our boss asked us to deliver something here in Mabalacat, so I dropped by. Good afternoon, ma'am. Mom, this is my friend Kath. She's also an intern at the factory. Vince told me that the food here is really good. He also told me that you own the place. No. My husband owns this. -Please, excuse us. -Excuse me, Kath. OK. Go home right after eating. It's difficult to catch the bus. I don't want your Aunt Beatrice to worry so don't go home late. -Just go home, Vince. -But, Mom... Even if I don't catch the bus, I can spend the night at your house, right? Good day, Mr. Jojo. Go. Your Uncle Jojo's here. Son, please don't come here uninvited next time, OK? Beverly! I'll take care of Vince's order. Yes, ma'am. The food here is great. You'll love it. You know what? I'm not that hungry. I'm sure James prepared lots of food for our date. Let's just cancel the order. Yes? OK? Come on? All right. -Let's go. -Yes, let's go. We don't want to be stuck in traffic. James did this? I'm sure you helped a lot putting up all these. This is electrical engineering work. Admit it. OK, fine. I helped him with this. You guys are really close. How long have you been staying with them? Since high school. So, what are we watching? -My favorite. -Your favorite. How did you know? James told me. You're both corny. -You both like cheesy romcoms. -Corny? That's a great film. If it's really your favorite, you should know all the lines. -Is that a challenge, Vince? -Come on. Challenge accepted. -All right. Let's see. -I know this one. Really? "Of all the do's and don'ts why can't you find one for yourself?" I thought romcoms were corny? This is my favorite too. Such a classic. -Let's see if you remember this. -Done! "You know, Judge, I don't believe in love. Forever-forever? That doesn't exist." "You know what? When you're in love, you're in love." "What if I'm stupid? What if I don't know that I'm already in love?" "Well, then you're stupid." -It's your turn. -It is? -Give me that. -Oh, I have one more line. -Promise! Just one more. -It's my turn. -Vince. One more line! Please. -It's my turn. Next scene... The hiccup scene... Everything becomes magical. She said she can hear music, and it's as if everybody is disappearing And the final proof that she is in love is... Do you think it's true? I don't know. What do you think? I think I need to get the food now. -Yes, that's right. -Yes. I have a challenge for you when you get back. Hey! Vince... Look! This is my favorite part. Faster! Vince, here! Here it is! Come here! It's almost there! Kath, sorry. I'll make it up to you. I promise that we'll celebrate all the special occasions together. Because you're special to me. I'm really sorry, Kath. I'm really sorry. Come inside. Let's eat! Kyle... Do you like what I brought for you, Kyle? -This is good. -Sis, look! Dad gave me a new toy. Kathleen! You're here. Come here. Eat with us. Your dad just got here. I cooked his favorite dish. Sis, Dad said he'll fix the bathroom door. This is great! I'm excited. By the way, the ceiling fan in my room is not working. It's a little hot there. Kath... Kath... Pass! Pass the ball. You! Nice one! What was that, guys? -Give 100% even if this just a practice. -Kath. So when game time comes, we won't have any problems, OK? James can't pick up. Is there something you want to tell him? Nothing. Please, let him know I called. Where are you? I'm at the auto shop. Thanks, Vince. Bye. What is it? Is the ice cream not enough? You're crazy. What happened? It's my Dad. He came back from Dubai. You know when the last time I saw him was? Before I entered college. He suddenly disappeared. We almost went crazy. We didn't know if he was dead or not. Turned out he just had another woman. He didn't even think of us. He left the house unfinished. We had to pawn the auto shop to my uncle. I barely had money for college. Life sucked. You know what hurts, Vince? Not everything can be fixed with one sorry. You really can't fix everything with sorry. But you're lucky. Because he came back. I think your father loves you a lot. Even though he wasn't sure you'd still accept him, he came back. At least he tried. If a person really loves you, he will fight for you. Loving means having the courage to fight for it. You look like this when you cry. Your cheeks. Stop crying, OK? I can take it from here. OK. Go inside now. OK. Thank you again. What's up Cap! LQ? Kath is not picking up. Isn't she with Vince? Can you really trust your cousin? He might be making a move on Kath. I agree. -Dude, Vince would never do that to me. -Are you sure? Kath is really beautiful. Your cousin is still a guy. -Exactly! -Shut up! All of you. -You're not helping! You all stink! -Just take a shower. Let's go. Shut up. Hey. What? Are you still thinking about how Vince held your hands? Come on, Kath. There's nothing wrong with that. Anyone who was with you at that moment would probably have done the same. Hey! Are you OK? See? You held my hand! We held hands. You're just overthinking it. Hey! Let's talk, Kathleen. Do you have feelings for Vince? You don't want James anymore? I don't know, Maxine. As time passes, I realize Vince and I are more compatible with each other. Even if Vince likes to tease me, we get along very well. I'm comfortable with him. I can be myself when we're together. That's it. That's the confirmation. It's you who's putting meaning into how Vince held your hand. Maxine. I'll just check on the other guests. Thank you. Nice outfit, I love it. -I've been waiting for you. -I'm sorry, James. The traffic was bad. Are you OK? Yes. Emman and the others are there. Wait, Kath. I'll go look for cuties. Let's go? -What's this? -That will do. That girl was so hard to get. Kath is here. -Do you know why I broke up with her? -Why? Her knees were so dark. -You're so judgmental. -Damn. Don't be a blabbermouth. Why don't you tell them that Kelly started the break up? Hah! Funny. Whatever. Seriously though, she's a gold digger. -I bet she is. -Oh, really? Oh my God. Do you know what the guy looks like that she dumped me for? -What does he look like? -Hideous. Hideous? -Are you serious? -Yes! I'm not kidding. Are you OK? I just... I don't feel well. I'll just sit down over there. -I'll go with you. -No, it's OK. -I'll go with you. -Hey, James. -What's up? -Nice party, bro. -Thank you. -All of our friends are here. Give me that. You know what? I wanted to jump in the pool. But they might leave because I'm so hot. You're not OK? James' rest house is huge, isn't it? We used to spend summers here. And that place you're sitting on right now, James used to pee there when we were younger. -You're disgusting. -It's true. Gosh! Look at Klinton. You're so judgmental. Your laughter is more judgmental. I already noticed it. -I thought that was just how he talked. -I know. Me too. Enjoy the party. Hey! You're here! Let's swim. Cap! Let's swim, birthday boy. Come on! Swim with us. Look at him! Look. -Hey. -What's wrong? I told you, your cousin's a traitor. -He's a guy. -I thought she wasn't feeling well? Why does she look so alive now that she's with Vince? That's true. She's really happy. Let's throw Jason into the pool. I have bad luck. -You do. -I do. You should change your clothes. You're soaking wet. Kath. Are you OK? Do you have extra clothes? You want to change in the guest room? All right. -Bro, you want mo to take Kath to--? -Bro, I can take care of my girlfriend. And don't ruin my plans. That's it. Let's go? Kath, do you want to rest for a while? Let's stay here. Vince and your friends might look for us. Let's go back. Don't mind them. Sit here beside me. Let's talk. Sit. OK. Kath... Are you ready? What do you mean? You know where this is going, right? James, I don't understand. Kath, you're my girlfriend. I'm your boyfriend. There's nothing wrong if we do it. James! Bro. I need to get something in there! Bro? Bro, stop bothering us. -Let's go back to th-- -No, Kath. James! Stop. James! No! Don't. What... Hey, bro! Have you lost your mind? Let's go, Kath. Stop it! -Vince? -There. The truth comes out. Did you really think I'd take advantage of Kath? You're so arrogant. You think you're great. Why? Because you like Kath? Huh? You're such a traitor! Do you know that? You ungrateful bastard. We took you in. We fed you and sent you to school. And if it weren't for us, you would be nothing. Enough. Are you taking his side? What's the story between the two of you? Is he your boyfriend? -Are you playing with us-- -That's not true. Then what's the truth, Kath? Tell me. I thought we were OK. But the more time I spend with you, the more I realize that we're not compatible. I'm pretending to be someone I'm not so you'll like me. I don't know... If not because of Vince, you wouldn't be like this. Why? Did you fall for his sweet messages? Huh? That's fine. I got you because of him, anyway. What now? Are you happy now? Because you pretended to be Var, you got the girl eventually. Kath, wait. Kath, let's talk. Fine, let's talk. Real talk. No lies. Why do you show up whenever James is not around? The ice cream? That night at the auto shop? The time you held my hand, Vince? Who was that? The guy pretending to be Var or the real Vince? -Kath... -Tell me the truth, Vince. Everything James said was true. I questioned my feelings for someone who can't fight for me. I believed you. I believed you when you said that if someone loves you, he'll fight for you. -Bye, girl. -Bye! See you. -Bro. -Hi, bro. The dean wants you in his office ASAP. OK. Thank you. Are you OK? I broke up with Daniela. I can't fool myself any longer so I told her the truth. If only I'd have told her earlier, I wouldn't have hurt her. Friend, are you OK? Bro, I'm gay. Wear your shades. Your eyes are puffy. Hon! You are nothing but a disgrace. You're so irresponsible. How about you, Vince? -Do you know anything about this? -Vince? Sis? Sorry, there's no one to manage the restaurant. What happened? James was caught plagiarizing. He copied Vince's thesis paper from last year. He said Vince agreed to this. Vince claims he only gave it as a guide. Belinda, my son can't get suspended. and he won't be able to graduate. Vince, let's talk outside. Mom, it wasn't my fault. You owe your Aunt Beatrice a lot. She paid for your school. She raised you as her own. You should take the blame. Mom, it wasn't my fault. But Vincent-- Mom, when will I stop paying for your debt? Isn't doing everything for others enough payment? Everything I have I give to James. I'm left with nothing. Mom, it's not my fault I am the result of your sin against Uncle Jojo. It's not my fault that I was born. But why do I always have to pay for other people's sin? Please, fight for me just once. I'm also your son. Dad, I'll put it here. Here's another one. Dad, I'll paint in a while too. There! There's Kath, hi! Do you know how to paint? Dad, I'll help you after that, OK? Doing it now. If any of you are thirsty, have a glass of juice. This is all my fault. -James. -Vince had nothing to do with this. Suspend me instead. -Clean the tables. -Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Don't worry, Mom. I won't be long. I just need your signature so I can enroll. -Thank you. -Vince. Vince, I'm sorry I didn't fight for you. I'm sorry I wasn't a mother to you. I'm sorry I'm a coward. I hope you don't become a coward like me. I love you, son. I love you so much. Let's go! Come on. There! You're both here. Talk it out. Thanks, bro. So, bro... Can we talk? You're running away again? Huh? Punch me. Let's fight. Fight me. Come on. You coward! What? You're crazy. What? That was tiring, bro. I'm so tired. So, we're good? That was tiring. Bro. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if you think I took everything from you. I'm really sorry. You're being so dramatic. It's embarrassing, bro. Dramatic? Should I just punch you again? -You're crazy. -Let's go. Kath throws better punches than you. Shut up. -How did you make Klinton say yes to you? -I threatened him. I think like he likes you. -Is he gay? Really? -Let's go and find him. Maxine? We're here. Kath and I are here at our school. We just finished enrolling. Maxine, just stick to the plan, OK? Yes. Take care. Make me look handsome. Good luck to me. Good luck, bro. What? You want to see me? -Who's WIM? -WIM stands for "Who I'll Marry". That's what me and my secret admirer call each other. -He wants us to meet. -Maxine, beware of those secret admirers. He might be great behind the phone, but a coward in person. Where did that come from? -That's why you should come with me. -I don't want to. No! You're coming with me. So you can kick WIM in the face if he's a pervert! Come on. OK, bye. You're so annoying. Kath, I'm nervous. I need to pee. Wait here. -I'll go to the ladies room to freshen up. -Maxine, don't leave me! HI, KATH! LET'S TALK, PLEASE. VINCE Kath! Let's talk. Talk to me, please. I shut down my blog. I don't need it anymore. I'm ready to tell the woman I like what I really feel for her. You own DaVinciQuotes? Are we good? No. And if you really own DaVinciQuotes, I want you to explain to me. In six words. If it exceeds six, I won't forgive you. That's too difficult. Fine. I'm sorry I'm a coward. I liked you even before. Five words again. I'm sorry. Didn't I tell you that sorry can't always fix things? -I'm lucky if you'll forgive me. -Vince! Stop saying useless things. I thought DaVinciQuotes was great. The world knows all the six-word stories in this book. But the last entry is only written for you. LOVE YOU These are only two words. You lost your chance! What a pity. Too bad. I... love... you... very... much, I... love... you... so much... I know. But my parents are strict. Can we just stick to the getting-to-know-you stage? Sure. WHY YOU'RE... BRO, WHERE'S MY SHOES? FRIEND, LET'S GO OUT LATER... HI, CLASSMATE, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL! BABE, LET'S WATCH A MOVIE LATER, MY TREAT!
