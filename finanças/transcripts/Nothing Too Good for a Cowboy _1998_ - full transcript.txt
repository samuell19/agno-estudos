Somebody you, uh, left back in New York City? No, never seen her before. I would've remembered. That's your brain looking out for you. Conjured a dream girl to keep you company. Chilcotin Indians say visions come to you to lead you out of the wilderness. They come to you 'cause you're horny. I don't know why I tell you anything. You value my vast experience of the frontier. Ha, that's... Thank you. Hey! Look out! [ Honking ] You some-bitch. What the hell are you doing? Can't you see we're trying to work! Yeah, you-- you inside that iron bucket. Oh, look, you sent my cows into the bushes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ought to just shoot them things. You know rich Hobson and panhandle Philips are running cattle from the batnuni all the west to the headwaters of the nechako. That's 200 miles. Yup... Four million acres of swamp, trees and Indians. Ahh, some prime grazing land, too. If you can get to it. Only a city boy would be crazy enough to try. How can they afford all that land? Mostly, they're working government leases. Mmm, those boys might end up owning the biggest cattle ranch in the world. If they can hang on to it. So I said, "maybe the train's not late. Maybe you're early." [ Laughing ] [ Mooing ] Hyah! Get along there! Hyah! Come on. [ Panhandle ]: Can almost taste the whisky on Rita's lips. [ Radio ]: This is the cbc radio network transmitting live to northern British Columbia. Pan Philips, don't tell me you're leaving tomorrow. I'm sorry, darlin', but rich and me have to go get that herd in Vancouver. Now, rich, this here is what a real, live woman looks like. 'Evening. How long you boys been out there? Enough for rich to start imagining things. I think I know someone who can set his mind at ease. Hitler invaded Poland. That's right, boys. Hitler and France declared war two days ago. How many died in the last war? 10 million? Ah, you yanks don't have to worry. Roosevelt says the states are going to stay neutral. At least somebody's showing some sense. Hey, somebody's got to stop Hitler. If you want to sign up... Who said anything about signing up? Well, I figured daddy being a war hero and all. Yeah, who'd run the ranch? I could take care of the ranch myself. Hell, think of all the time I'd save not having to keep you out of trouble. Keeping me out of trouble. Yeah, rich, wasn't too long ago you was just another city slicker. Hey, George? This here's kind of a private conversation. Just trying to help you straighten out rich. That's my job. You know, rich, uh, when you first showed up here, we never thought you'd have the sand to make it through one winter. Say, George. Yeah? Oh, pan, you shouldn't have done that. Just think it's time you went and joined Lester and shorty. [ Laughing ] Pan... Something he said? I hope you're not going to waste the whole night brawling. Lead me from temptation. You need someone to save you, too? Train pulls out at 4:30. Mm-hmm. Hard to know what to do, right? Mr. Tewksbury. It's, uh, it's tough trying to keep a ranch going this far north... With a war looming. I remember when we were going overseas in '15. Well, first thing, I have to get my herd to market. By the look of that herd, you haven't had a good year. Those are just calls and castoffs, Mr. Tewksbury. Taking them to Vancouver to sell to see US through till spring. Price is way down. If something... Unforeseen happens, don't you hesitate to come over and see me at the bank, huh? We'll be fine, once we get to Vancouver. Thanks. Come on. Come on. Get down there. Get. Get in there 'fore I lose my temper. Aaahhh! That mangy cuss was this close to being tonight's barbecue. This all there is? Yeah. Tom... Do your best. I suppose you boys know prices are way down. It's a good thing you decided to give that old boy a stay of execution. I'll figure this out. Go up. Your money man's waiting. Van dusen? Why would he come all the way out here from New York City? Maybe it's good he did. We'll need more money to get through the winter. The investors want out. Now? It's been three years. We're almost making it work. Well, with the war in Europe they just see so many different ways of making huge profits. If the war goes on, the price of beef will go up. We're not just doing it for money. Oh, I know, I know. When I first sold the last great wilderness cattle ranch in North America, investors bought in because it sounded romantic, hmm. Now it's the sound of war? I mean, these people see far bigger opportunities. Well... You tell them that their investment is 700 miles north of here, eating grass in the fawnie mountains. They want to cash out, they can saddle up and go get them. No, pan...Pan. Phew... We run out of time, we run out of money. Now, rich, come on. Come on back to New York. You, you could dine out for years on your cowboy adventure. What about pan? Oh, he's always going to find something to do. People still remember your father. With your mother's contacts, you could walk into any business you want. I'm already in the business I want. Well...you're a cowboy. I mean, it's, it's not a proper business. It's, uh-- a dream. I'm not walking away from it. Well, the investors will want to see some money. Next fall we're going to bring in 250 head, then they'll see their profits. We're so close. We just need a little more cash. Well, I can give you the time, but you're not getting another nickel. You didn't get the money? We'll just have to get by with what we got for this call herd. How much was it? If I'd known you were going to come out empty-handed, I never would have bought them horses. Horses? Prime breeding stock. Tom was going to ship them to France, but the deal fell through. How much? He turns them out at town's edge, but the locals dislike having wild horses in their back yard. How much? They was practically free. Ok, well, how much? They got arabian blood. 800. Pan, how are we supposed to buy supplies and hire cow punchers through the winter? We still got 1,200 left. You should be able to make that do. All right, and what about trucking them? Can't afford a truck. We'll run them straight back here. So just, uh, run them right through the middle of the city? It's not the middle of the city, it's the edge of the city. We'll do it tonight, when everybody's asleep. Ok, well... It's one of your crazier ones. You know your failing? You don't know a good plan when you hear one. When I hear one, I'll let you know. What did I tell you? Slick as goose grease. You doubt me. [ Honking ] [ Whinnying ] Well, hiya. Easy. Easy.

Forget it, Connor, we've all proposed to her. Arch even pulled the old shipping off to war gag. My militia unit's on voluntary standby. Didn't even get him a date. Clearly, she saved the best for last. I'll wager, by midnight tonight, Gloria McIntosh will be wearing my ring. I'll take that bet. Yeah. Not bad, Connor. Damn. You have to be pretty quick to catch that girl. Excuse me, I didn't see you there. Pff, happens all the time. You wouldn't know where Gloria's going? To work. Where's that? Oh, don't worry, I'm not here to make trouble. Chez Marcel, berard and pinder, downtown. Thank you. 'Course, any time you want to make trouble with me... [ Bell ringing ] Good morning. Hi. Monsieur Marcel isn't here right now. Could I help you? Looking for a hat. For your wife? No. Uh, for my mother. I'm sorry, have we met? No, not actually. Oh, for a moment there you looked familiar. Well, I saw you. I was at the sterling club. That must be it. What's she like? Your mother. Very natural. Sort of like a hurricane or an earthquake. [ Laughing ] I meant was there a particular style? Something small -- I'll need to ship it to New York. You're from New York City? Uh-huh. What brings you here? I'm in stock. Must be so exciting to live in New York. Well, for my money, it's pretty fine right here. Mountains, forests. That's just scenery. That's not very exciting. You can find excitement in your own back yard. Hmm, maybe your back yard. How does this look? Beautiful. You'll take it? I'd love to. Are you free this evening? Would you have dinner with me? I already have an engagement. Well, that's just fine. ...at the club. Maybe I'll see you there. You bet. That will be $75. Mother will love it. Don't tell me. Mr. Richmond Hobson Jr. is a stockbroker. It's as bad as Connor and his father's insurance company. A little birdy told me that Connor's going to pop the question. Poor Connor. They're rich, they're handsome, they're crazy about you -- show a little enthusiasm. I look at Connor and I see the whole rest of my life. Mm-hmm, pretty plush. What more could you want? I want to thank you for the loan of the suit. I don't know. Let me guess. The cowboy from last night. You stole my clothes. Borrrowed, just until I could buy this rig. I bet he doesn't know what tomorrow will bring. Sure he does: Beans, cold water and the smell of horse manure. Sorry, it was an emergency. Excuse me. Told you you had to be quick. Who is this Hobson fellow? Is it true they are getting engaged? He's some stockbroker from New York. Hmm, she's not serious about him. No? I doubt it. Who is she serious about? Today, some cowboy, apparently. Connor, I need another Martini. Of course. That Hobson fellow really doesn't belong here. Rich Hobson. Ask him to leave. Have we met? Insist that he leave. Why doesn't Connor believe that you're a stockbroker? I used to be. I still deal in stock. In a way. And New York? Used to be. I live near vanderhoof now. Way up north. Mm-hmm. And what exactly do you do up there with all that scenery? Well, the truth is-- excuse me, um, there's someone here to see Mr. Hobson. Excuse me. Hurry back, Mr. Hobson. I do so want to hear the truth. Of course. Can I help you, boys? Well, this is a private club, chum. You don't have an invitation. Guess I was counting on a good old western hospitality. Well, if you leave now, we won't call the police. I'll say good night to miss McIntosh. I haven't finished my conversation. Yes, you have. You just don't know it yet. It's the second time you got in my way. You trouble is you don't know how to take a hint. Anything you want... I can give you. My father will buy US a house. Connor, I don't know what to say. Gloria, you got see this. It is you. I, I, I couldn't leave without saying good night. Told you he wasn't a stockbroker. Good night. Don't get up boys, I'm leaving. Gloria... Oh. Sorry. Connor? You kids want some more coffee? Why didn't you tell me who you were? Doughnuts? Didn't make a good first impression. Toast? The second impression wasn't up to much either. Well, I'm sure you'll get back to me on that. When you rode across that lawn last night... Gloria. You don't have dreams. I wanted to jump up behind you right then and there, and ride off into the night. Paper, paper! Get your paper! We're going to war! So you boys want to be the first to sign up. I need a month to keep my cattle onto winter pasture-- forget it. Give me a month. I have to hire-- agricultural worker? You can't enlist. What? Essential to the war effort. Go back home, raise those cattle. Army's going to need plenty of beef. Yeah, but-- how long do we have? I'm not going. Oh, thank goodness. They say ranchers are essential to the war effort. I couldn't bear it if you left. I still have to go back to the ranch, Gloria. For how long? I'll be back. I'm bringing a big herd next fall. Think that'll hold you for a year, cowboy? I don't like it any more than you do. Take me with you. Nechako's too rough for a woman. Especially during the winter, I can't. No rougher than the club when people hear that my cowboy dumped me. Single woman on a remote ranch with a bunch of cowboys? You think the gossip's bad down here. I don't care. I care. You're serious.

Burt Graham and George pinchback? Gone. Al, Joe, Lester, and shorty? All gone. They're my roundup crew. Too bad. Looks like winter's coming early, too. Damn. Tewksbury bought a ticket for anybody who said he wanted to sign up. Hey, you don't want a drink or anything? No. Hey, I got married. That's nice. I have to go over to the bank. I'll see you at the livery stable, ok? You hijacked my crew. I was just doing my civic duty. Those boys were chomping at the bit to serve king and country. If I was younger. Somebody's got to feed the army. Those boys were exempt from military service. Had you signed them up yet? I was in Vancouver. So technically, the boys were unemployed. I was getting married. Congratulations. And you say you want to serve your country. Marriage is expensive, and I hear you boys bought some horses, too. Yeah, that's right, and no, I don't want to take a mortgage on the ranch. Oh, no need. How many head of cattle do you plan on bringing to market? 250. More than enough to secure a loan until fall. I can have all the paperwork done this afternoon. Why didn't you tell me? Uh, it's just temporary. Could have gone to my parents for a loan. They wouldn't let me into the house when you told them we'd just gotten married, Gloria. Daddy can't stay mad at me for more than three days. Well, I'm not starting off married life mooching off my in-laws. Besides, tewksbury owes me for shipping off all my cow hands. What are you doing? Deciding what to take. How many packhorses do we have? Gloria, I don't think-- excuse me. Mr. Hobson. Can we talk to you, sir? Ed gross, isn't it? Uh, yes, sir. Me and Tommy'd like to join up with you. Wonderful, rich was looking for cowboys. You ever round up cattle before? Uh, yes, sir, my brother took me, uh... Well, once, but... You ever ride range? Uh... Lay out feed? Clear trail? Mend fence? No, but I can learn. See, ed will show me. Sure he will. Rich? We can do it. I'm grateful for the offer, boys, but, uh, I can't use you. Rich, give them a chance. They want to help. Look, Gloria, cow punching's a man's job. Now, if I'm going to be short-handed, I'm going to need seasoned men. I guess you're out of luck, sir. All your seasoned men have signed up to kill Nazis. He don't mean no offence. He's a little mad 'cause the army turned him away-- shut up! He's got a point. 30 a month and board. Be ready to ride from Franklin's store at 6:00 tomorrow. Yes, sir. One thing, though. I'm only staying until they take me in the army. Ma'am. Go on, rich, why don't you ask him, too? No way. Son, you go on home now. Ah! He'll think I left my brain in Vancouver. You should be grateful you found three cow hands. Three? I sent the little one home. I told you I can ride. Gloria, this isn't a Sunday canter in Stanley park. Let me see if I've got this straight. You need at least six hands. By your own count you've got only two. No, you can't count those two green kids. Of course not. You really don't even have two riders, but you don't want me, is that it? What am I supposed to do while you're out punching cows all winter? Uh, I was hoping you could set up a place for US here in town. Then, in spring, when I get things squared away with pan... What's this got to do with pan? He's my partner. So am I, and if you expect me to just sit around here and wait for you like some kind of high-priced floozie-- Gloria! What? We ride at 6:00. Yes, dear. Tommy, ed, I hired you two. Tell your little buddy he's got to go home. That guy? I never seen him before. Never saw him before yesterday. Son, quit following US. You go home now. I told you that English saddle wouldn't be, uh, good for the trail. It's fine. I'm fine. Where are you boys going? Oh, uh, well, we just-- we thought that, uh... You and Mrs. Hobson are all-- best you stay by the fire. But-- Gloria, anything could be prowling out there in the dark. What about him? Maybe the boys should keep him company? No. For safety. The boys stay right here. But...if it's dangerous. A night on his own will send him packing. He's got a fire. He'll be fine. [ Thunder crashing ] Ok, it's all right. Welcome home, Mrs. Hobson. It's, uh...It's perfect. We'll fix it up before too long. Come on in. It's not locked. Well, aren't you going to carry me over the threshold, Mr. Hobson? Right this way, Mrs. Hobson. The honeymoon suite. Wait, ed, would you get my camera? Don't. Where do you think you're going? They're newlyweds. It's cold. Get out! Pan? No. Ma'am. Robert mcdaniels. It appears, uh, congratulations are in order. Thank you. Rich Hobson, this is my wife Gloria. I was riding through the chilcotin. I heard you were short-handed. You got that right. 30 a month and board. I'll unpack my gear. Ma'am. You hired him? We need hands. A complete stranger? I've heard the name. But he just waltzed in here and made himself at home. Yeah, people are welcome to use the house if they need shelter. That's the way it works out here. But he was wearing a gun. Some do. Is that really him? Shh. Ed, Tommy. Stable and feed the horses. Rider on the Ridge. Ed, ride out and tell that kid he can come in for dinner. Yes, sir. Then he goes home. So, where's pan? Well, he should be here. But he's not. Maybe...where could he be? Well, he's probably still at pan Meadow rounding up stock. We'll give him a couple of days. What if something happened to him? Ha, pan can handle himself. He'll be along. When? I don't know, Gloria, soon. Soon? We go look for him? Oh, yeah. Rich, how would you know? Tommy, keep spider and buck saddled. Good idea. Are you sure about this, rich? Yeah, it's no problem. When the water gets really high, you want to grab onto your saddle horn and swim. Oh, that's what that funny thing is for. This is far enough for today. Really? I'm going to miss Tommy and ed. Well, you'll just have to get used to roughing it with me. [ Chuckling ] Ow. I'll get some firewood. We'll set up camp underneath one of those trees. Why don't you grab the food... What's your hurry, cowboy? What, didn't you know the way to a man's heart is through his stomach? I wasn't aiming that high. Now, pan's going to be mighty surprised to see you.

Hmm? Ever tell you I had blood poisoning? I was wild-catting in Texas. I value experience over books. Doctor said I might die if he didn't amputate. Appears he got a second opinion. Got on a train to Dallas. Doctor there saved my foot. I sure hope you were paying attention. "If you look for me tomorrow, you'll find me a grave man." Here. I gave it up. We have to cut deep. Make sure we get to the core of the infection. Let's get her done. You won't need that. I won't pull away. [ Screaming ] Gloria, could you sponge up this blood? Here, here, take these. What's, uh, wild-catting? What? Wild-catting in Texas? Uh, working on the rigs, drilling for oil. You never told me about that. Wasn't a secret. I did it after I dropped out of Stanford. Stanford? Anything else I should know about your past? If we're going to be spending next 50 years together, I thought I'd better parcel out the stories. Can this heart-to-heart wait till you can give it undivided attention? Sorry. How are you doing? It's not throbbing like it was. Ok. I think we better put the drains in. Oh. He's asleep. Is he going to be ok? It's too early to tell. He could have bled to death. Yeah, it had to be done. All he did was scratch his hand. It's the way it is out here. A little thing can kill you. Look at those stars. Rich said that you loved his biscuits. They're too hard. He beats them too much. [ Laughing ] I guess you are feeling better. You don't need to worry about me. I suppose you'll be wanting to get back to town before the snows close the trails. I'm not going back to vanderhoof. I'm here to stay. I needn't smell like a horse. You said, "go get her." I said, "go find her." Oh, get, find, what's the difference? It was your idea. She haunted you -- I figured, get her out of your system -- I never said marry her and bring her back. She's here, and you're going to have to live with it. I'm not the only one. I know what I'm doing. That would be a first. Think about this. She is a nice citified girl who's spent all her life surrounded by people making a fuss over her. How will she survive on her own through winter? She's not going to be on her own. You'll be out tanning cattle from here to hell. I was waiting till you got better, but there's been a change in plans. Hey, just because I had a little accident does not mean that you can go changing plans -- as soon as Lester, shorty and the boys arrive-- you should know something about them. What? Something happen to them? No, except now you should be calling them privates Lester and shorty. Oh, I thought they was smarter than that. Everybody signed up. Come to that, what are you doing here? Trying to get the herd through the winter. We were central to the war effort. Then who did you hire on? Couple of boys. Cowboy out of the chilcotin. Robert mcdaniels. Gentleman of colour? Who are the boys? No one you know -- if we try and get through winter with this few hands, we must bring most of the herd down to the home ranch. Since you went off and introduced some novelty to your domestic situation, this whole operation has gone to hell. That novelty saved your life, pan. It was Gloria's idea to come up and see you right away. I would have waited a few days for you to show. And you would have been dead. See? This is no good, rich. Already, you're letting her run our lives. I'll bet getting hitched put a pretty big hole in our grub stake. Well, about as big as a bunch of horses. I was married. You? Spent our first winter in a line camp in Montana, hundred miles from nowhere. Came back from riding fence one day, and, uh, she'd cleared out. Really? I'll come up with a plan-- no, don't you worry about that. I, I got it covered. What do you mean, you got that covered? I got it covered. What are you talking about? Tewksbury, he gave me a loan. You told him we were bringing in the whole 250 head. Yes, I... Great, good job. Winter's coming, we're out here. I lose one cow, I lose the herd. Now I'm talking to a horse. Your husband's quite the little trail cook. Mm-hmm. Spicy. This one of them recipes your daddy brought back from Cuba? Rich sr. Risked his life to trap the entire Spanish fleet in Santiago harbour. I didn't know. He won the medal of honour! Heck of a story. [ Horse neighing ] Sing out. Porter, Leo Porter, rcmp. Pan. Leo. Leo, I'd like to introduce you to Gloria m-- to my wife, Gloria Hobson. How do you do, constable? Pleasure to meet you, ma'am. Well, congratulations, rich. This is a surprise. Thank you. That's our rich. Full of surprises. Here, Leo, take a load off. There you go. Have some stew. What happened to you? Oh, little scratch got out of control. I'm all right now. Good. Thank you. We got word that Daniel Roberts was back in the area. I thought maybe you-- I wondered what it would take to get you back on horse, Leo. Little use for motor cars in this country. Keep an eye out. Daniel Roberts? Yes, ma'am, tall negro fellow. Not Robert-- now, Leo, before you're full of rich's Cuban stew, we'd better put up your horse. I'll help you. I don't want to frighten you, but Daniel Roberts is a bad one. When are you going to stop scaring the greenhorns? He's wanted for murder in Arkansas. Wouldn't surprise me if he's using an alias. Hurry back. It's not as clear as all that. Porter said he's looking for a Daniel Roberts. Oh, of course, a real murderer named Daniel Roberts would come up with a better alias than Robert mcdaniels. Sure he would. [ Wolves howling ] You don't know one thing about that Robert mcdaniels, do you? This isn't like the city. We don't go snooping into other people's lives. Oh, so now I'm a snoop because I want to know whether I'm going to be living with a murderer? A man's personal business is his own affair. If he wants to tell you, he will. Don't ask. Right. Just like you don't ask about wild-catting. Stanford? That's right. It's the code of the frontier. That is ridiculous, rich. Judge a man by his actions. The way he sits a horse, how he keeps his rig. Why does he carry a gun? We left him with those boys. Look, even if mcdaniels is the man, who really knows what happened? He's wanted in Arkansas. Could be a whole case of mistaken identity. Now, are you so sure he's the only negro in this territory? Have they reported the road company of porgy and Bess gone missing? [ Wolves howling ] Come on, get down. Come here. Come here. Hurts, doesn't it? Oh, I got you. That's them? I said boys. Did you at least get their parents to pay you for toilet training? Where's mcdaniels? He said he was going to start gathering the batnuni herd. He left before the mountie came. I thought I told you to go home. Mcdaniels said he could stay. He rides pretty good. Here. Your mama know where you are? My mother's dead. Put up the horses. They've been on the trail for two days. This is some nice setup you got here. What do you mean? Wife, kids, whole family. What are you talking about? I guess that makes me the hired hand. If you were the hired hand, I could fire your ass. We better get going. Yeah, uh, great dinner, Mrs. Hobson. Yeah, good night. We start breaking them new mustangs in in the morning. Any of you ever broke? No, of course not. Good night. Good night, boys. Now all we need is two, three months to teach them roping and branding. Oh, I'm so tired I could sleep on a bed of nails. I guess you got the floor, rich. Uh, Gloria, would you like to play some cards? I couldn't keep my eyes open for another minute. Pan, don't you have to, uh... Uh-uh. I went already. Women! City underwear. You would have stopped. Wouldn't you? Ah, ah! Come on, come on. Move over. Give me some... Bugger. Big mistake. Kids. Come on, stick with it. That's it. All summer, the cows graze the highlands so we can grow hay in the valley. Then we drive them back here so we can feed them through the winter. Easy, easy. We gotta get them back before the snow sticks. Why? 'Cause they're dumb -- they'll starve to death before they learn how scrape the snow off the grass to eat. [ Whinnying ] That's it. That's it, kit. Nice riding. Hold him. [ Groaning ] [ Whooping ] All right, roll out of the way. Ok. Gloria, take this bronc. Don't you train them to the saddle first? If you got the time. Easy, easy, easy. Are you ok? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure? Gloria, don't bother them. They want to be treated like men. All right, back to work. Look at that. Kit took the fight out of him. He's such a runt, the bronc probably didn't know he was up there. [ Gasping ] Let me see. Don't tell, please don't tell. Is it a stabbing pain inside? No, it's more the muscles. It's probably just a bad bruise. You were lucky. Uh-huh. Kit, how old are you? 15...almost. Kit. I ride better than the boys, better than you, too. They need me on the drive. If anything happened here-- if you try and send me home, I'll run away somewhere else. Gloria, there's hay to be stacked. He's all right. Well, then let's go. Ooh, ooh! She's turned to snow. How difficult would it be to drive 250 head of cattle from the batnuni to the nechako this time of year? Well, if the weather holds up, with enough men. How about with two teenage boys and a young woman from Vancouver as your crew. Good night, Irene. I loaned money on that herd. What? Hobson and Philips? The herd is collateral, all 250 head. I hate to be the one to tell you, but they won't have 250 head after a drive like that. That would be a shame. I have to call the loan. Go. 15 for two. 22. How much longer are we going to hang around here? Well, I was thinking-- always dangerous. I could go out and get those cows, and, you know, you could stay here, let your hand heal. Gloria could stay with you. What? In case he has a relapse. Even with one hand, I am still the best-- I'm not fetching coffee-- I never asked you to. You can't leave me behind. Fine. We'll all go, one big happy family. 31 for two. You'd be, uh, Robert mcdaniels. That's right. Looks like you got about 50 here. Another 50 to pull out of the bush. How's your crew shaping up? Make rich look like he was born to the saddle. Put the feed bag on. We push these critters home 4:30 tomorrow morning. Don't you find that saddle a whole lot easier? Oh, just like a big easy chair. If your legs hurt, your stirrups are too short. If your rump hurts, they're too long. What if they both hurt? Just right. What happened to Tommy? Horse tried to scrape him off a tree. Let me help you with that. Mr. Mcdaniels, I'm sorry. Ed was pushing me, and... I'm sorry. Sorry. It's all right, son. No harm done. Except your pouch. Well, I'll make good on your tobacco, I promise. As soon as we return to town. That's a long time between cigarettes. Well, that was sure close. It was an accident. You see the size of the knife he carries? They say he hacked his way across Texas and Oklahoma. He only kills women, right? Yeah, sure... So far. By my count, we're missing about eight head. Are you people herding cattle or sleepwalking? Could've lost them back where the trail split. Right, I'll swing back and find them. You're cooking. Uh, Robert, you better go. And take kit with you. Wouldn't it be better if one of the older boys went? Uh, I was kind of hoping to rest my leg. Kit, you don't mind, huh? Nope. Rich, I could cook and you go. That's a novel idea. Now, if we're through discussing this, head out before them beeves die of old age. Well, you could've said something. Pan's the trail boss. It's best you don't interfere in these things. Oh, so I just let the mighty panhandle Philips send off a young boy with a man who might be an axe-murderer. Look, I know you're tired, but if you argue with pan, it only confuses the hands. You could ride out and get him. Gloria, it's... This isn't a democracy. It's a cattle drive. You can't abide that, maybe you should go back to the ranch. Why stop there? Look, I'm just trying to tell you-- why not go back to vanderhoof? Better still, Vancouver. That's what you really want, isn't it?

Coffee? Uh...yeah. You seen Gloria? No. Ed, where's buck? Gone when I came in off night watch. Guess miss Hobson went for a ride. That wife of yours just might cut it. You know where she went? She's finally starting to listen to you. What are you talking about? If that's the case, don't matter who's responsible. Pan, is it too much trouble for you to make sense? Don't worry, she was up before dawn. I watched her saddle buck and ride out. Why didn't you wake me? Don't you know anything about women? Last night, for the first time, you laid down the law, and she listened. She's gone back to the home ranch. I do believe she's learning her place. Kit? Kit? Kit! Get away from her! What's got into you, woman? Gloria, stop it! But the knife. A tree branch gashed my head. Cutting some muslin to make a bandage. I'm sorry, I thought-- that he was going to kill me? There was blood on your hat. You found my hat? I'm so sorry, Robert. No harm done. You ride up here by yourself? I was worried. Being in the bush by yourself can be unsettling. Let's fix up your head. That's my hat you're wearing. I don't see any sign she came this way, pan. Tracking never was your strong point. Think we can push them through to the home ranch tonight? Herding after dark -- that's a good way to lose cattle. There's no way she could've got lost. If you're so worried about her, why don't you ride on ahead. Me and the boys'll bring them in without you. No, that's all right. Buck would've taken her straight home. Come on. I'll take first watch. Ok. Did you tell them? If you tell, they'll probably send US back to town together. [ Twig snapping ] You should always sing out when you walk up on a camp, ma'am. I'm sorry about this afternoon. It's passed from memory. I heard some things. About me? About a man named Daniel Roberts. The mountie said that he's on the run up here. Most folks out here are on the run from something or other. Take kit, for example. And Mr. Hobson. What does rich have to run from? You tell me. I'm afraid I'm the one who's being presumptuous. It's my turn to apologize. Back in Arkansas there was-- you don't have to explain. Rich told me about the code. The code? You don't ask a man about his past. Back in Arkansas there was a fella tried to force himself on a ladyfriend of mine. We fought. He died. I'm not the judge. He was a white man. I go back to Arkansas, they going to hang me. Good night... Mr. Mcdaniels. Yah! Come on. Hey...don't worry, we'll have you home for supper tonight. Keep the cows moving. Porter's coming up the trail. You can't keep running forever. All I ask is to choose the time and place I make my stand. Watch over the boy. Tsk-tsk. Constable Porter, good morning. Mrs. Hobson. Just you and the boy? Kind of thought I'd see Daniel Roberts up here. Do you see him? You bringing this herd in on your own, you and the boy? Not bad for a couple of greeners, eh? You be careful, Mrs. Hobson. You're in dangerous territory. Giddap. Tsk-tsk. Tsk-tsk-tsk. Ha, look at that. Got a fire going. What did I tell you? She's probably got coffee and pie waiting. Tewksbury? There go two. You stay with the herd. We can't lose any more. Keep your head down. The note's not due till next fall. You guaranteed the loan with your herd. If the herd's short, the loan's a risk. They're all here. Just brought the last ones down to the valley. Oh, how convenient. Let's, uh, go do a count. The light's going pretty quick. We'll count for you tomorrow morning. I'd prefer to do it today if you don't mind. Good. Where's Gloria? Isn't she with you? Where you going? To find Gloria. What about tewksbury? We don't have 250. You keep telling me you can do it all yourself -- do it. Bank's taking our cattle. You don't care? If it comes down to cattle or my wife, I don't care about the damn cows. How's she ever going to learn? See, if you ask me-- I didn't ask you. I'll just stick a knife in tewksbury and hide his body in the woods. Sounds like a plan. Oh! Oh, no! Pretty good -- I don't think I've seen a herd this good. Hang on a sec. 224, 225... Did you get this one over here? I think you, I think you missed him over here. I'm not there. 226, 227, 228... 229, 230, 231... ...43, 44, 45... ...35, hang on, now. Hang on, 35-- 36... No, it's 46, 47. 37. Kit, where's Gloria? Went in the bush after a stray about a mile back. Gloria! Gloria! Gloria...gloria! Gloria. ...41, 42... No, no, 250. I got that. 243, you're seven short. No, I really don't think you counted this one right here. I counted that one. You're seven short. Now, look... Gloria! Gloria! Gloria! Yes? Oh, are you all right? Like you said. It's the little things that get you down. I was worried about you. You don't think I can handle myself? Yeah, looks like you can, but when tewksbury said you weren't at the ranch-- tewksbury? Yeah, he showed up to count the herd. Listen, I've never told you this, but I've been-- what does he want? Well, if we're short, he'll call the loan. I get these dreams, and-- are we short? I've been seeing-- maybe not with these-- why are we wasting time? Let's get them home. Gloria. What? Come on, yah. I love you! Ha, ha! Y-Y-You can't take the whole herd because we're seven steers short -- it's only $1,500. You don't have the cash, I can liquidate the collateral. That's the law. You sell this beef now, it's giving it away. Oh, naturally, anything in excess of the loan would come back to you. I can't ride herd on money! I'm sorry, pan. I don't like doing this to you. Well, you could've fooled me. Rider on the Ridge! Ha, ha, look, there are your missing steers! One, two, three, four-- yeah, yeah, no, no, I only count-- there's another one coming-- ...five, that's all you got -- 248. Mr. Tewksbury, wait. You only got 248 and you're supposed to have 250, pan. There's seven right there. You are two short. I counted them. You got 240... ...some sort of agreement. It's only two steers. You signed a contract. That's all there is to it. Why are you ruining US? Because if we can't pay off our investors, Mr. Tewksbury buys himself a developed ranch at bargain-basement prices. You should have that looked at. How much are two cows worth? Today's prices: Hundred apiece. Man would be a fool to ignore a good investment opportunity. I'd say this is worth $200. Gloria. Wouldn't you, Mr. Tewksbury? I can't take your wedding ring, Mrs.-- if you could take our ranch, you can take that. Will it secure the loan? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess it would. We'll be claiming that in the fall. Yeah, well, uh, I'll be leaving soon, uh... I'll just go in, check I haven't left anything. [ Whistling ] You know, if you'd brought back two more strays, you'd still have your wedding ring. Kit, I just wanted to thank you for sticking by Gloria down the trail. It was nothing. Well, I appreciate it. So does she. That's right, what we need is more cowboys like you. I better go wash up. You...you were pretty impressive yourself. I just did what had to be done. Gloria Hobson. Richmond Hobson Jr. Don't you ever leave me. Take that to the bank, cowboy. Uh, tewksbury's ready to leave. Just thought you might want to know. I'm sure he wouldn't mind taking Gloria to vanderhoof. She might not be able to get another chance before we get snowed in, you know. Uh-huh. So? So... She's not going. We're going to need all the help we can get. ♪ She doesn't belong here ♪♪ Mrs. Hobson. Mm-hmm? I apologize, but can you excuse me for a minute? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Are you going to stop this? Just as soon as she leaves. I'll have to stomp your stubborn butt. So I beat you. Then what? You win, she goes back to vanderhoof. I win, she stays, full partner. What are you doing? Go away, now. It's between US. You can't fight him. Sure I can. I'm gonna settle this once and for all. No, this is my fight. I'll take him on. Just let me do this one thing. See? Once they start. I can fight my own battles, ok? Let's go. Fine, you take him. Come on. You take him. What are the rules? Well? Rules? This is a fight behind the barn. There are no rules! Just asking. Go on, pan, you teach her. Now, look-- what do you got? Let's go, come on. Hoo-hoo! Here, let me help you up. Come on, pan. Come on, I can't-- come on. Come on. Rich, this is...This is... Come on, pan. Rich. Let go of me! You can't just hold my hands like that. I can't do this. I can't fight a woman. Then I win. Ha, ha! Then I guess you get to stay. I'd never leave. [ Giggling ] Come here. I love you. Come on, partner. She beat you fair and square. That was pretty slick play. Something I might try myself. Well, that's got to be the first time anybody ever had an idea as good as you. Guys, I was thinking about those two strays. Kit and I could saddle up first thing tomorrow morning and go find them before the snow gets deep. Really, we could do it. Oh, it's going to be a hard winter. Long, hard winter. I'm serious, and while we're gone, you two could plan an addition onto the house, because, ha, we need more room. And now that I'm full partner...
