Ju-On who? Jung Won, not Ju-On. He helped me when I first arrived. Hey, Four. Why is everytime we talk, ...you only talk about Ju-On? Never talk about Emma. So what is it? What’s going on? Well... it’s something in secret. Wanna talk? I’ll get him here. No, I can’t. How would you like to take motor taxi? It's only 50 baht, sir. Wow, thank you for speaking English very well.

" "Find someone else in London. Loads of men there.	" "I struggle enough with Thai	let alone trying to speak English.	" ...to speak English. You have to go… ...or your brother-in-law thinks you don’t like him. That’s one thing. Me freaking out, that’s another thing. I can’t speak English, that’s another thing. He would understand. He is not stupid. And he will try to talk to you. It becomes stressful that he tries to talk to me. Stressful about what? Of course I’m stressful. Let’s say if he talks to me. I become stressful then I freak out. When I freak out. How could I explain? Eating chilli reliefs stress. / Yeah, eating chilli reliefs stress. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. / Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Why? If you start the first sentence, ...he would think you can. And he will talk to you all the time. So I can’t speak to him at all? Then don’t go. No, I have to. It’s Pen’s wedding. Or you don’t love her? Four, did you tell your friends that I'm a mechanic? I did. Not just an ordinary mechanic. What mechanic? Super cutie mechanic. My girlfriend, in London. Bo, should we race? I’m going to school, and you are going home. Let’s see who will arrive first. The shuttle boat against subway in London? Of course the shuttle boat is faster. Fine. Fine.

It’s too tiring, you should finish your study… ...and find a job in Thailand. You don’t have to do both. Nah, they pay good money here. Actually, I even want to get a job here. But I miss someone in Thailand. One moment. What’s wrong, Four? Why are you crying? I’m not. The dust just got in my eyes. Tell me. I’m not crying. The dust really got in my eyes. Look, I’m fine. How about I sell my old house… ...and go to London? Just the dust got in my eyes, and you’ll sell your house? Your tear drop matters to me. I’m going to London. Don’t come here. I’m fine. Why can’t a suburbs guy like me go to London? How will you get here? You can only say Yes, No, OK. (House for sale) Hi, thank you very much. It's a very good place for my stay. / Yes. Haven’t met you for so long. Miss you. Give me a hug. Are these all your stuff? / Yes. Let’s go. / Wait. Let me buy a SIM card first. What? Why do you want it so soon? Don’t you miss me? I read about it. It’s cheap here. Alright, we’ll buy it later. Go. It’s cold. Michael is a really nice guy. You’ll like him when you meet. Got something to insert the hole? Want to take the SIM tray out. Can you do it at home? Listen to me first. Afraid of getting lost. Hey, listen to me. Here is the story. It was 7 o’clock on my holiday. I went to the beach… ...and was looking out. After a while, there was a wind blew from nowhere. It blew my scarf away. It was gone. Wait. Wait. Wait. What does it have to do with Michael? Hey, don't rush. I’m telling now. Alright. Alright. Day 2. On day 2… ...I went to work at the clinic. And I met Michael. Hi, how's your feeling today?/ I'm great, how are you? Ok. I'm gonna start up with your legs first then I move up. How about you lay your side? Straight up. Are you ok? Yeah. / I'm ok. Lift up. Day 3. I bump into him at front of my flat. I just realized that he has been living there for years. But we never met. Where did you get that scarf? Is it yours? What the hell is this? When I told him that the scarf was mine. He was surprised. And shouted ‘Destiny’. What's Disney? No, that’s Walt Disney. This is ‘Destiny’ as in godsent. Godsent, ‘Destiny’, I see. Destiny, OK? I see, Destiny. And on day 8, it was the last day of the treatment. I was treating him. And he wrote on his back, ‘You are the apple of my eye’ Apple. What is it to do with an apple? It’s an idiom. It means you are my heart. Something like that. What is idiom? Are you happy, have a foreigner brother-in-law? Yeah, I guess. I don’t even know what idiom is. Hey. Here, Michael calls me June. Don’t be confused. Call yourself Polly, I beg you. Why? Because Pron means ‘Porno’. Pron means ‘Porno’. Oh, so, my nickname is Polly. What are you doing? You need to delete that. Give me the phone. I said give me the phone. I want you to delete that picture now. I can’t speak Thai. No, English. Give me the phone. Pen. You need to delete that. Give me the phone. Are you alright? Can I help you? If you start the first sentence, ...he would think you can. And he will talk to you all the time. I…I…can please. Where are you going? Where are you from? Are you lost? Is everything alright? I…I…I…/ Can I see your passport, please? Pospart? / Passport, please. Stop. Miss, are you Thai? Is there anything I can help? Can you speak English? Sir, her English is very bad and I think she's a bit nervous. Can you please tell her I need to see her passport. / Right. Police wanted to see your passport. Oh, passport. / Have you got it? Thank you very much. You are welcome, we are all Thai. Next time, you should prepare yourself better. The passport, ...travelling, …listening and speaking English. Cause it will makes Thai women look stupid. Pron, waited for long? Pen. After your wedding, I go back home. I won’t get married anytime soon. Michael has a bicycle accident. He still has cast on his arm. It won’t be healed within 7 days. What did you say? Hi, welcome, nice to meet you. Nice to %?!#?* you too. What? Nice to…Me… What are you laughing about? You just said you want to give him a blow job. But it’s OK. They don’t use this word here. What does Moke mean? I think you better swap the room with me. I got a queen size double bed. It's more comfortable for you. What about you? / I'll move here instead. Thanks a lot, that's very kind of you. What did Ju-On say? Jung Won! Yeah, What did he say? He offered to swap his room… ...because he has a bigger bed. Tell him it’s alright. I can sleep on a couch. If you wanted. It's your call. Yeah. Here, I barely made it through. "No. No. No. " Is this yours? / Yes. Bo, how much is it for my bra? Not a big deal. I bought it for you. Come on, you bought me so many times. Don’t worry. Hey... you still owe me. Last time you lost, didn’t you? Take off your pants, I’ll kiss you. Cheeky. Kiss the cheeks for losing, not the butt-cheeks. What? You have nice hands. Why? "Hi, Four, nice to meet you. I talk to you later," ...I'm busy right now. Whoa, Four, have a nice trip. Ok, bye. What did she say? She just said hello. Oh, okay. Let’s get to the point. Which is? I want to really arrive London. Have you not now? No… What? I want to get laid with women here, is it hard? With women here? It’s not that hard. But women here don’t smile much. If they smile at you, ...you have a shot. While you are waiting for the wedding, ...you should take an English course. It might help you stop freaking out. I’ve learned English since I was a kid... Still doesn't help. Well... how long I have to learn then? If you exclaim in English. That’s it. If you dream in English. You got a hang of it. If you have a foreigner boyfriend, ...you'll get right accent. Like you?

I do want to talk to him, ...thanks him for loving you, ...and takes care of you. Then talk about other things. May be about when you were a tomboy. I’ll kill you. The second rule of communication. You don't just learn English in the classroom. No, you have to go to the market. And buy some thing to cook. What a lesson is it! Teach us about to cook but not even light a fire. Although, the course is so expensive. Do we look stupid? I think he wants to teach us how English work. After we finish shopping… Shall we go to cook at my home. Invite Antoine? No no no... Hey hey!

I came back home… ...didn’t see him. So I called… ...and we argued. I think my English is well enough to get a foreigner husband, ...we still can’t understand each other. It’s not about the meaning. It’s about the feeling. I think possible means possible. But Michael think possible means possibly. Hey, Four. / What? You said you had an exam. I’m going. Bo, I’m in a hurry. Gotta go. Bye. Why is your hair wet? Darling. Hey, Jude. What have you done? What did I do? Why did you making fun of her? She is mute. Wanna eat? Want some? It’s already bad enough for her.
