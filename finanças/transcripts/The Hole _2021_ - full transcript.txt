In Milan. Once in New York, I saw a window cleaner, he was singing. When he got to the bottom, I asked him, "Why are you singing?" He said, "I like to see others work behind the windows," forgetting that he was also working. [Man 2] Exactly! As I am also working. It's just that, I'm performing a bit, but I'm performing to make you participate in the emotions. That's my job, bringing the audience with me, the viewers that are at home, and take them, slowly, slowly, from the ground floor up to 120 metres. If I look down... My God, what a view... Which floor are we at now? [Man 2] We are at... the 24th floor. [Man] Pan a bit towards the inside, let's see if we can discover who is there. This is the 25th floor. Who is she? [Man 2] I don't recognise the young lady, I know Dr Camagni. Dr Castellani. 26th floor. Here we have the Budget office. [Man] Do they all have air conditioning? [Man 2] Yes, yes, all have air conditioning. Now, we are at the 30th floor - the chairman's office. Engineer Leopoldo, Dr Andrea. [Man] Is he the owner's son? Yes, he is the son of Engineer Leopoldo, the vice president. Here is the Belvedere. Through the Belvedere, you can see the other side. Pan over here. Here, the skyscraper still under construction. This way, yes, perfect, like that. Yes, pan upwards. [Lively marching band music] [Man, on PA]The train from Milan to Reggio Calabria Centrale is now leaving from Platform 1.

BETWEEN CERCHIARA AND SAN LORENZO BELLIZZI, THE TEAM EXPLORED THE ABYSS OF BIFURTO AND AFTER ENDLESS DAYS OF IMMERSION, REACHED ITS BOTTOM AT -687 METERS. IT WAS THEN, THE THIRD DEEPEST CAVE IN THE WORLD. IL BUCO IS FREELY INSPIRED BY THAT ENTERPRISE AND DEDICATED TO ITS PROTAGONISTS. [Water drips] Subtitles by TITRAFILM.
