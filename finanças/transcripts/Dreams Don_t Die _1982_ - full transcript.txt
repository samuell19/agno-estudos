Stop on over there. You all right Captain? I think I'll conduct myself on an interview. What's that? Look at that car. That's cool. Oh yeah. Hey it's you! Beg your pardon young lady but I uh, could not help but notice that you're usin' re energized not say new dress. Be mine and to buy said new dress. Get lost. You perhaps insulted that I mentioned your wardrobe? I'm no whore. I see. You think I'm a pimp. May I ask what you're reading? Huckleberry Finn. Afraid I haven't read that mans books. That's the title you ape. Of course you will realize that I never had your education. Yet I guess I've still managed in my ignorance. Can I take you for a short drive? No. I just wanna talk to you about earning money and not having to hurt no one. Now how much money am I talkin' about? Oh I'm filled with suspense. Thousands. Many thousands. Now you're a bright girl with old clothes. That's gotta be interesting to you. You think I'd dress in threads like these if I had the girls? That's 42nd Street sweet lady. Then what do you handle? Only what I can get away with. You're under 16 aren't you girl? Yeah. So what? You're under 16 you got plans don't you? Bright girl with the plans. Where are they? Over some rainbow am I not right? Come on, take a drive with me. Nothing's gonna happen to you, except you're gonna hear about money. You know what money is don't you? Money is the future. Money is respect. Money is love, and money makes plans happen. Come on, let's take a short drive. Would you like a drink or something to smoke? No. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kirk, Captain of this ship. In it I see all the galaxies of the city. That's ridiculous. So tell me, how can I earn all this money? Well, that's easy. When do you turn 16 pretty lady? In April. April 10. Ah well, Aires huh? Aires do real well in this line of work. Ever been arrested? No. I didn't think so. I saw you sitting there reading. I was-- What line of work? Now you're thinkin' I put stuff in little kids. Dope. Entertainment. Something for rich folks to do that ain't got anything better to do with their time then to stuff something up their nose. No, let me tell-- Now listen here girl. This isn't for kids. There's some fine money for you here. We sell a kinda cocktail for grownups who like cocktails. What do you care about that? You clean, under 16, won't get tried as an adult. Worse can happen to you is you get your hand slapped. You got six months pretty eyes. It could mean about 50,000 or there abouts. 50,000? Then you retire. I got a birthday in just a couple of days. Then I got a hard retirement ahead of me. A hard, hard retirement. You're not an idiot girl. You're no fool. Sell the rich folks what they want. Permit me to uh, reenergize your dress. Take us to a store. What are you doin'? Standin' around. What are you gonna do, give me a hard time? No. Why should I care? You care. Don't act with me. Well talk to me. Since you're here say something. Nice dress. That's right. It's a good dress. He's garbage. What do you know about it? Look, I know enough. I woulda thought you had more brains. Oh I got brains Danny. I wanna get far away from here and that's a fact. You don't, another fact. See how smart I am? Look, it's gonna get all over you. What are you worried about Danny? That it's against the law? Well what are you? King 65? You're King of the Line. Most famous dude burnin' trains in the city. There's a difference. Sure there is. Hold it! Get in here boy. Move it! Come on. All right, sit down. Now lookie here. A white boy, a white boy writer. You must be a toy, huh? Where you from, Flatbush? Yonkers? I ain't no toy. You ever seen the tag King 65? Yeah, I seen it. So what? Is that your tag? Look, that's all I gotta say to you. I'm the King of the Line is what I am. Oh my. Feel those goosebumps risin' up and down my arms. Well King you sure picked the wrong tunnel tonight. This platform's had two rapes this week. As a matter of fact I was countin' on catchin' that creep. I thought for a minute you were my man 'til I heard all that sprayin' and then I knew I just had me another damn pest. Pest? I'm an artist. All right, you're an artist. Ask any one of the other writers. Just ask 'em who's the best. You're an artist. Every couple of weeks they strip these cars down to the buff. Then your so called works of art go down in an acid bath. Well they don't all. I've had some cars on the line for months. You call yourself an artist? Look, all you do is paint over these windows so that some cop like me can't see some poor new gettin' his head bashed in. Or some lady gettin' hassled. All right, on your feet. Assume the position. What's your name King? Danny Baker. Am I goin' in? No I got more important things to do but look, I know your face now so you'd be makin' a big mistake to hit this line again. Now what do we got here? It's my sketch. Don't tear it up, huh? If you saw that up on another car, would you know it's mine? Yeah I might. It's got a style. You got real talent Danny. It's a shame you waste it. I mean most people who see this just so much trouble in their life you know what I mean? They hate it. They hate what you do. They only like it when it's been washed off. We'll see how good you really are. Smell those fumes. How do you kids keep from being asphyxiated. You ought to be in art school. Art school? Now you know what that is. Here's how you do an arm. Here's the way a tree's supposed to be done. It's just more law. You know what I mean. Nah, this is pure. I mean this is just the way I wanna do it and there's no rule right? I mean, that's the point. The whole point's for it to be lawless. Where's your daddy? The last time I saw him he was runnin' away from home. Well I know what I could do you know? Trespassing, defacing public property. But listen, you keep drawing. Let me see some of your stuff, all right? But look, this time, hey? Keep it off the walls and if I catch you again I'll haul you in righteous. Hey, it's cool. Maybe I'll draw you a picture. Thanks. You do that. I'm easy to find. I'm all over the place just like graffiti. Be gentle and expect the new Teresa. Be in that lobby across the street. He'll have an ivory necklace and he'll be a white man. Are you nervous? Yeah. Get your head at rest young lady. After all you're just a charm. They don't apply the adult law to you Teresa. Not for six months. So you here to deliver something? Yeah. Give it to me. Thank you. Uh, you want any wine? I keep forgetting when children aren't here. Well now Mr. Gavin your bank account don't forget that fact. Kirk, no need to talk business. Let's just uh, get acquainted meeting with this new friend of yours. That job you did for me yesterday wasn't hard was it? Teresa, beautiful name. Italiano? No. I lost my folks when I was a baby but the best I've been able to figure is I'm Puerto Rican and some kind of European. I myself am Northern. North everywhere. You got a birthday comin' up Kirk. September 25 my good man. Just over a week. I am then retired and looking for other work. Oh there's always work for a man with responsibility. I like the girl, she'll do well. Captain Kirk knows who up. Yeah. Mr. Gavin, I don't wanna get nervous about my birthday you know I mean? We all know the rules Kirk. Get caught dealing after you're 16 there's no escape. You pull hard time. Right, so? So, don't turn 16. Stay young forever like me. Kirk, Kirk! Kirk! Look. I was asleep. I was just takin' a nap. What are you talkin' about? Captain, you ain't gonna believe this. Come on man. Oh man! I just closed my eyes, that's all. Hey get over here miss thang. I shoulda kicked in your door last night. What are you talkin' about? You followed me. You trashed his car. He wanted to kill somebody last night. Do you think I'm kidding? No. Look, I did it yesterday. I didn't like it but I did it. I'm in it now Danny and you can't change that. Do what you want to T, so will I. He's just having it repainted, that's all. He's havin' it repainted today. I mean what does he care? He's got a lotta money. Sure, so he buys things. He's buying you. Look, he's buying you Teresa. All I've heard from you are bright ideas and plans. And then when someone sticks money in your nose you gave up. You gave up easy. No, not easy. I've asked you a long time to work with me, how to get out of here and what to do. But you never cared. You don't need me. So don't play it big with me now Danny. You stay out of it. Good afternoon. Afternoon officer. You know there was a man in that building over there, had a big beard. Had lots of rings on his fingers. I didn't like the way it looked. So I had a squad car run him in. Oh yeah? I seen you around before. You do the dude keepin' all the streets safe and sound. Well someday they'll give you a gold watch for it. Hey, you have a warrant for searchin' her? Probable cause? No way. Hope this isn't what I think it is. Just earned my gold watch. Okay, come on let's go. Hey man, you wastin' my time you know that? This dude's more scared then I'm supposed to be. Oh relax. I think I should represent him Officer. I have to inform you that under the-- - Hey, Lieutenant Steadman? Lieutenant Steadman this is a very anxious attorney. How do you do? I have to inform you that under the laws-- You're new at this. You firm sure sent you to the wrong part of town man. Under the laws minors are-- Yes I know they're both under 16. And furthermore-- Yes, I know there was no transaction. Possession by a juvenile of a small amount of cannabis-- Man, they sent down a real turkey didn't they? Where's my regular lawyer turkey? It's a real bad trip isn't it Charlie? I mean a man put his six years in law school and he ends up in the garbage cans of New York bailing out little kids. Hey, who's your client? Albert Gavin? I bet you had other plans didn't you Counselor? Officer you know the DA won't file. Furthermore, Mr. Kirk was clean. So take him. No him not her. What are you crazy man? Hey, she's comin' with us. Okay it isn't so easy now is it? Oh no possession's not easy at all. Is it? Uh, no. No. So, get him out of here. Hey just hold on man, she's comin' with us man. Yo, I'm gettin' my regular lawyer. I'm getting him and coming back too! Say finish these for me will ya dude? Give Teresa a little tour of the resort. Hey Charlie? You can't do this. I'm under 16. Don't tell me what I can't do girl. I can hold you here for 24 hours and I can make it very unpleasant. Nothing like a jail cell is there? Everybody think they got it all worked out in their heads. When they get behind these bars you realize they haven't got anything worked out at all. It doesn't make any sense. You were clean, never been arrested. Yeah, I've been a very good little girl. You were. Possession of drugs by a juvenile's a tough wrap and don't you kid yourself about that. What kinda grades do you get? Pretty good I'll bet, huh? When I want 'em I get 'em. Then why? Explain it to me. Look, what I am is case number F2121-L on the city of New York's books with a foster family that never has less than five kids floating around in it. So I get good grades. So I never got arrested. Well so what? Teresa! You all right? Well, it's the King. Word sure travels fast on these streets. What is this Banks? What are you gonna do with her? Why don't the three of us talk about that huh? Come on in here. Gimme a couple of minutes to sign out. Why don't you two chat? You two could help me and cheat work is always the best way. You know that. Gavin sure knows it. He and Kirk make a good team. Look at the bundle they pull in. They don't run any risk. Teresa's the only one that runs any risk. Look, Banks you wanna bust Gavin but there's nothin' we can do to help ya. Why sure there is. It's a little matter of teamwork that's all. You know that. I mean all you subway artists got your little club, your little groups, your little clicks, your little-- Yeah and I don't belong to any of 'em. I work alone. Look Danny, let me put it to you like this. You already owe me one favor. Now we need to make it two. Teresa's already working with Gavin. I mean I could use that now. Just call it my own creativity all right? What's the matter Baker? You think you're the only street artist around here? Come on. How is your drawings coming anyway? I'm clean. Oh I see. Look how he's wearing these little dainty doctors gloves. Really cute. But where's my drawing? Come on, you promised me a painting didn't you? Let's go down to the tracks. I'll pick one out for you. Uh huh. No, you promised me a painting. I don't wanna see that horrible garbage. I mean you really think that a punk with a spray can is ever anything but a punk with a spray can? Hey, hey, Danny is an artist. An artist? So where's my painting? You're sure just a punk with a spray can that's all kid. - You want a painting? How 'bout an old gram on a rocking chair or maybe a baby with a pair of wings or something huh? That's painting for you right? Yeah right, boring. When was the last time he opened your eyes and saw what real artists were up to? You wanna see some art? I'll show you some art. Come on. Let's catch a train. I got the time. Oh come on. Where to? Across the river to the land of surprises. Are you scared to even look? Let's go. Thank you. It's on me King. Just have a look at it now. I'll see ya later. Well what do you think? Told you in the tunnels what I thought. These paintings hang in the middle of Manhattan. So do mine. Yeah, but a lot of these people get paid for what they do Danny. How 'bout you? You get paid for trashin' trains? How 'bout it Danny? Wouldn't you like to get paid for what you do? I may know someone who can help. I'll be in touch Teresa. Look, I need good teamwork and you need a chance. I'll be in touch. You see that? The writer who tagged himself Snow. I see his tag every now and then. Why Snow? Why does he call himself that? I don't know. He's called himself that for a long time now. He's gotta be 26 by now. Lives with his mom. It's stupid. Anyone 26 who's still writin' on walls is just stupid. Hey T? You ever been there before? The museum? No, Manhattan. You ever been there before? No. Never. Me neither. Weird huh? The land of surprises. Hey. What's the matter? You mad about somethin'? No. Go to your room Danny. Please. I yelled at him and he slapped me. It's nothing-- Look he ought to be shoved down a toilet. Danny, it's nothing. It's the way we are. It's not your problem honey please. No, it's not. Danny, it's not your problem. You leave my mother alone you stinkin' garbage. Shut up. Your old lady and me will take care of our problems in our way. Why don't you go paint a train car. You're so tough. Maybe there's something else you wanna do. Maybe there's something else you think you can do. It's done. Well you were up there too long. I was tired. Hey look, just shut up all right? Look a dudes got a right to catch some sleep. - I don't wanna hear it anymore. How you treat somebody like this. Hey! Shut up man! Hey! I don't need this man. Oh my mother's heart! Look, what you throwin' things for? This ain't broke. - So move! Next time move all right? Huh? - All right. All right. Run man, run! Kirk? Mr. Gavin, how are you this fine morning sir? I'd like for you and me to take a little walk. Must be somethin' I can do for you. You can answer a question. What happened yesterday with you and that girl? It's just a hassle, nothin' big. That nigger cop just done me man. I don't know why. You know who he was Captain? His name is Banks. Oh yeah, I seen his face around before. His name is Banks. You know his face? You're gonna be 16 in a couple of days. So you got two choices. You can uh, walk away from it all, your own territory, your girls. Yeah, no. I don't want to. You can deal with men like Banks. You good enough? Are you tough enough to be of use when you're no longer a juvenile? You gonna grow up Kirk? Be a man? Obadiah? Some fool callin' himself Captain Kirk say he wanna talk to you. Banks! Hey. - Hey King, what's the word? The word, the word's interesting. I'll walk along with you okay? Sure, just don't effect my view. A man in my position needs his view you know? Hey look uh, you said maybe I could get paid for drawin'. Uh, well I'm interested. I wanna talk about it. Where you are Danny? Been smokin' angel dust? No man I don't use dope. That's for losers. You wrote somethin' tonight right? Must be a thing of beauty, a real burner okay? Mm hm. Man it looks perfect. It was so good I had a whole gang of toys sittin' on top of a car watchin' me with their eyes popped out. So now you're high on it right? You're up and you wanna talk about a distinguished career? Step into my office here. Hey Charlie you're early tonight. Tonight I'm bein' interrogated. That's why I'm off my schedule. Sit down Danny. What are you havin', coffee? No, I'll take a strawberry milkshake. Where do you think you are, in Scarsdale? We'll have coffee and a strawberry shake Ken. So what's the offer Banks? Well the conditions. I yeah I know, I gotta help you squash the toad. It's no problem. My pleasure. There's one other. There'll be no more burners, no more writing on public walls anyplace. All right, tell me Banks. Comic books. You do know what they are right? Well I have this friend who owes me favors. I've always found that favors are better then money in the pocket. So who is he? An executive. Works for the firm that puts out what they like to call illustrated publications. I even told him about you and you know he'd never hear of King 65? All right, so what's the arrangement? There is none. He only guarantee us the interview, but our deal still stands. As of now, there'll be no more burnin', no more trashin' trains. Now is it a deal? Deal. That's the man to call. Dale Sherman? Do it Danny. Be nice to yourself. Do it for Teresa too. You don't know what it's like, about to bury the one that you love. It's a mistake. Level Banks. I mean do you think anyone's really gonna care what I write or how? I don't know. The only guarantee is the interview. The world's full of chances Danny. Take one. Listen, you learn how to make coffee I'll be back Ken. Hey, thanks! Banks, Banks, Banks? Help! Help, somebody please help me! Help! Help somebody please! Call an ambulance! Please, go call an ambulance or somethin'. Don't just stand there. Please help! Go call an ambulance. Don't worry, you'll be all right. You'll be all right. Just don't move. Don't move. You'll be all right. Please! Okay, bring them in. Uh, you look right through here Danny. That's him, the one with the busted up face. We're about to have fun. Well we've had little Obi in a lineup before. That's a bad news kid. We never could hold him. Nice job Officer. Nice job. We couldn't try him as an adult 'cause he's only 13. So we said hey, put him over on hold over at family court. When they do they'd lost him. His file was lost in the shuffle. Somehow he just walked out. Yeah and then he kills Charlie Banks. Yeah. Now you saw the shooting right? Look he did it, I saw it from the diner. Wait a minute, Charlie wasn't killed in the diner. Did you see the shooting? Look he did it. I grabbed him, I saw him there. - But did you see him shooting? Are you an eye witness or aren't ya? Look, he wasn't found with a weapon. If you're not an eye witness I've got nothing. Danny? I didn't see you all day yesterday. God, I was so worried after I heard about what happened. What's this? I promised Banks I'd go see this guy. About drawing? Yeah. It won't mean anything but I gotta go. It does mean something Danny, it does. I gotta do this and then I gotta do somethin' else. What? Danny, don't do anything stupid. I gotta get Kirk. There's no future. Not 'til I've settled that. Danny let go. You can't change things. I can't walk away from this T. Banks cared and he did somethin' about it. How often does that ever happen? Will you help me Teresa? Help me out? Yeah. It's okay Banks. It's just a little shot to get me through the day. Here, have a seat. So, tell me, how'd you happen to meet Charlie and how is he? He's dead. Dead? That's why I'm here. Dead? Yeah. Kid killed him. A kid? How old? 14. 14 years old. Charlie Banks cared about what he did. Can't tell you how sorry I am to hear this. Well, all right let's, let's talk about what Charlie wanted us to talk about. What is it that you want? What is it you're looking for? Well you see this is the first time I ever really thought about anything like, permanent you know? You wanna be a commercial artist huh? This is something you really wanna do, a career? Sure. How old are ya Danny? 17. 17. You still in school? Yeah. But it's useless. I wanna draw. I really do. This is, this is graffiti. This is just graffiti. Well that's what I do. Banks thought that well, he said that maybe you might be-- All right. All right, let's just take it easy. I'll tell you what. Uh, I wanna show this to some other people who work here. Just take it easy. Just uh, sit tight all right? Relax, I'll be, I'll be back. Danny? This is Agnes Shields. Agnes, Danny Baker. Hello Danny. Hi. Why don't we all sit down, huh? Danny, do you think you'd like to apprentice? Agnes thinks you might do well in her department. Apprentice? Uh, does that mean like try out or somethin'? No, apprentice means you're hired but at less pay then you'll be getting if the job works out. Job? Drawing? That's right. Danny it's not that you just have talent. For someone with no formal training you have remarkable technique too. Charlie would be very pleased. Teresa? T! They like me. Yeah, they said I was good. Oh but they said I gotta learn, and there's all kinda other things I gotta learn but, but they said it wouldn't be like a miracle or nothin' for me to learn it you know? Yeah. Oh T. Everything's buzzin' inside me. Listen, I want us to do everything right okay? Yeah. Yeah, Banks. Um, look at your place okay? So I'll see ya T. Yeah, September 25th, 1965. Now you're sure?

One of 'em had a wife die. He got some insurance money. Got his old lady to pop for his score. Now that's a dude who knows how things should work. When they asked me if you could handle quantity, I told them you could do anything. I like gratitude my woman. I like it very much. And I remember you said Monday was your birthday right? So true. But this bein' only Saturday we still have time. Did you want me to set it up? Sunday night. Lord rested and Kirk did his last steal. Maybe we should celebrate. Little party before the job. Quiet, private. Just you and me. Alone? Well I don't know your friends. Some motel okay? Forgive my impoliteness pretty eyes, but since when you been spreading it around? You didn't have the thought of love the first time you and me talked. Well fine, we'll do the drop. No party. Wait now, hold on don't get outta orbit. Look, I told you I'm no whore. Now what I say?
