Come with me. Open up, Tyler! I know you're in there! Break it. Oh my God. Look here. Six antique chairs. One gold frame mirror. Three silver candelabras. Hey, check this out. We also get a 1961 Cadillac hearse. Right, your great Uncle Harry Cates turned the place into a funeral home for a time. Oh, great. ♪ All day long we'll just sit around the house ♪ Hold still, Meow. Look at all these mansions. Ours is just as big. Maybe a little bit older. According to the probate report, it was built in 1926. Hey, Scott, there's our school. It's only a few blocks from the house. You could just walk there. Maybe you could drive the hearse. Yeah. I'd be styling. Pull up to campus in a hearse. What do you think, Dad? Theater Arts. I still don't see what you want with that stupid curriculum. They gave me a scholarship. Yeah and one in engineering. Hope it's not on this block. We're almost there, kids. Neat, Mom. Home. Come on, now, give it a chance. The whole area's under urban renewal. It's starting to redevelop. Is it safe? I understand they have a very strong neighborhood watch program. Yeah, the neighbors watch you get mugged. That's not true. She's right, she's right. Most of them participate. ♪ And I change my mind ♪ ♪ Happens every time ♪ ♪ I don't know why I can't get started ♪ Keep you up with the roosters. Now get the fuck out of here. Welcome to the neighborhood. Yeah. We got company. Excuse me. Hate to break up your little party but we're moving in. Hey, Crip. These folks are moving in. Get the shotgun out of the car. Dad, no guns. Damn it, Scotty, do as I say. Okay, let's move it. I'm warning you, Silk. Stay away from these folks or you're gonna do another six months. She's not your type, Crip. She hasn't murdered anybody yet. Now get the hell out of here. Bunch of animals. Say, are you folks really gonna move in to the old Tyler place? Tyler place? My uncle, Harry Cates, owned this place for 50 years. Oh yeah, well, some names just kinda stick. It has to do with some old actor. Nobody's wanted to live in this place... Hey, hey, hey. A lot of nonsense, really. We haven't heard anything for years. My family can take care of themselves. Well that's good because we got our hands full around here. Yeah but don't hesitate to call us, okay? Well that was reassuring. Oh, God. I see the decorators were here. Damn. I thought I told the city to turn on the electricity. Did you mail the check? I mailed it in. There was a problem at the bank. I'll get a flashlight. Oh boy. Yuck. "To Myrna. "Eternal love." I couldn't find the... Wow. Anything wrong? No. Well I'm going out for some food. You got any preference? Pizza? How'd I know you'd say that? This is unreal. Now they want to include this inheritance in the bankruptcy. We're gonna have to go back for the court hearing. Then that's what we'll do. The chord on this blanket's all frayed. Darn it. Would've felt so good tonight too. Sylvia, there's no electricity. Future reference. I can't believe how badly I failed all of you. Having to live in this monstrosity. It's gonna work out. Don't worry, Harry. You're the best. Hello? anybody home? Tyler. How about that? I don't know, I think we're gonna like it here. I think so too. It's so pretty. When we get the house fixed up, maybe Dad will let us have a party. Yeah. So, did you get that theatrical makeup course? Uh huh. You gotta see the special makeup effects they can do down there. It's wild. So, was it locked? I don't know, it must've been jammed. It's really bizarre. There was this stage setting up there from the 1930s. Sounds demented. Kinda ranks up there with biology. Biology? We have to dissect frogs. But it's okay. We chloroform them fist. Oh. I got it! Watch out! Hey, wanna play? We need a fourth. The old knee's acting up. You can take my place. I'll play for 10 minutes. Okay. How're you doing? Petie. Scott. Okay, our ups. Come on, you ready? Here you go, watch it. All right, good one! Robin? Hello, Robin Cates. Can we have the ball, please? "Please." I like that. Very polite. Especially for some jambone motherfucker. Why don't you just give us the ball? What do you think, Melvin? Should I give it to him? Sure, give it to him. Leave him alone! That's enough! Don't, he'll hurt you. You know, it's only gonna get worse. Have you ever considered moving out? Let's go! Come on, let's get out of here! It's payback time! Let's not tell Mom and Dad about this, all right? They got enough problems. Okay. That fuck! I want his fucking ass now! No rush. They're not going anywhere. Yet. What's with the lights? Oh, the electric company said they fixed them but I can't get them on. Scott, there's an old fuse box in the cellar. Do you think you could? I'll check it out. Take the flashlight. Be careful. I will. We better hurry up in case he can't get the lights fixed. Okay. He should be home soon. Imagine working for someone after owning your own company for all these years. What's that? I don't know. Probably just some old pipes. It's coming from behind here. What's this for? I don't know, I didn't even notice it. It stopped. This thing's pretty cool, huh? An old dumbwaiter. What's the matter, didn't the fuse work? Haven't we got enough problems without you scaring the hell out of us? I'm sorry, it won't happen again. Scott, are you on the third floor?! Yeah, Dad. It's almost midnight and you've been spending a lot of time up there. There's some pretty interesting stuff up here. I thought maybe you were stashing a broad. Not quite. I'll be down in a minute. Help! Relax! Relax, relax, son! That must've been some dream to get you all tangled up like that. It wasn't a dream. I felt a presence in the room. Damn it, Scott, you're doing it again. You're right, you're right. I guess it was just a dream. All right, come on, let's get you back to bed. Come on, honey. Come on. Goodnight, son. Goodnight. Goodnight, Scotty. Goodnight. Miss? I guess she didn't hear me. Hey! my man. How're you doing, you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Did you give that motorcycle back to that mutant? You bet, I might be a little stupid but I'm not crazy. I owe you one. Forget it. Hey, I need to look something up. How can I get some help around here? Hey, I'm the man. Oh yeah? Well, unless the Lakers make me a better offer. Now what do you need? A stage actor from the 1930s, Tyler Walker. Oh, that's easy. You know, a lot of theater arts students do reports on him. That dude lived over there on Marlow. So I hear. The word is, that old Tyler place is spooked. Yeah? Okay, come on, I'll show you the files. I heard some family just moved in there. Really? Yeah, must be the Addams Family. Here you go. This is a reference only. I had some files on him. Some creep came up here and stole them. Oh, this is great, thanks. Sure. Hey, let's play hoops again sometime. Hey, anytime. Where'd you say you lived at? 2509 Marlow. "In a macabre finish, reminiscent of his many stage roles, "renowned character actor, Tyler Walker, took his life "over the marriage of Myrna Robins, "his leading lady for many years, "to Harry Cates." Oh my God. So Tyler's lover was our great aunt Myrna Cates. She appeared in most of his plays until she married Uncle Harry. It was even rumored that she and Tyler had an illegitimate child together. Spicy. What do you think? A little family resemblance? Not really. Well, I don't know, maybe. Goodnight. Cute, Scott, real cute. Scott. Scott! What? I saw something in the mirror. I shouldn't have shown you that picture. It's okay, don't worry. Sure. It's not safe in the streets and now it's not even safe in this house. Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow? Kitty, is that you? Meow? Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. Meow. No time for romance, Romeo. Take her. Dad, Robin's gone! Robin? You bastards! Scott! Robin! Touch my kids again and you're dead! You hear me? Dead! Dad. Are you okay? It's a good thing you woke up. Thanks. We have to have positive identification. But I know who they are. You said they were wearing masks. It doesn't matter. You drew these from memory? That's a wonderful talent. But it's nothing we can use in court, I'm sorry. That's it? Well, we'll speak to them, of course, but we have nothing to go on. Oh yeah, yeah, sure, speak to them by all means. I know this must make you angry but... You're damn right I'm angry! If this is all the police have to offer, believe me, I'll protect my family any damn way I see fit! Here you go, Scott, give it a try. No thanks. Come on, with a little practice you could be an expert with this. Dad, guns get people killed, remember? Not that piece, here. Now here's some serious artillery. Here you go. No, really, I'm trying to quit. How the hell do you expect to defend yourself? I'll manage. And Robin? What the hell kind of kid did I raise? What're you chicken shit or are you just plain stupid? All right, looking good, Rambo. Heard it was open season on Japanese imports. Look, Scotty, that court date's in four weeks. Do me a favor, will you? Promise me you'll keep this shotgun by your bed while we're back in Boulder. It's gonna start this time, I can feel it. Forget it, that old thing's gone away with the dinosaurs. Come on, baby. Shit. So much for the pep talk. We could use a car when Mom and Dad are gone. Yeah right, a car. What's this? An old circulating pump. I use it to suck a lot of the crap and condensation out of the gas tank. Wasting your time. I thought you were gonna build me a kiln so I can fire up some of these masterpieces of mine. I will as soon as I get this started. Yeah! God damn! Look, I hate to sound like some paranoid parent but... There's nothing to worry about. It's been two months since anything happened. Besides, I have midterms. And I get car sick. It's just that we've got to get to that hearing. We can't let them take everything. Don't worry. Give your mom a kiss. I love you. I love you too. Good luck up there. Thanks. Now you think about what I said. I will. All right, bye. "Count Dracula desires the pleasure of your company. "And a trip to the crypt." Nice accent, Count.

Melvin's dead. Someone cut off his head. Shut the fuck up! Nobody is dead. Nobody but those two kids. Then where's Melvin? Some performance, huh, Tyler? I hope we didn't detract from your reputation. who're you talking to? No one. Watch out for Aunt Myrna. Aunt Myrna? What're you talking about? Tyler used to pretend that mannequin was Aunt Myrna. Come on, Scott. I'm serious. In a fit of passion he signed the deed to this house over to her. Then she went and married Uncle Harry. Poor Tyler. No wonder he looks so mean. If it's any consolation, Aunt Myrna died in a Swiss sanitarium about a year ago. She never got over the death of her first love. Have you guys git any idea of what you've done?

Old Tyler's ghost, Mom. Nah. Police found a reasonable explanation for all the deaths. All at once? Sure. With the psychos hopped up on drugs and booze. Hell, anything could've happened.

Crip never had no family life. I kinda kept him company. He was always drawn to this place. I never knew why. I think I do now. Cops had me go through his family stuff. Yeah? His old man ran off a long time ago but I remember Crip saying that his father as adopted. "Born to Myrna Robins the 16th day of December, 1934." That would make Crip's father. That's right. Crip's father was... Tyler's illegitimate son. Yeah. I kinda miss old Tyler. Two months and not a peep. I guess he's found peace. I don't wanna talk about it. Hey, I need that. So do I.
