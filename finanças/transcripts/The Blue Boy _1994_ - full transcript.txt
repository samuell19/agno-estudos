-DOCTOR: Can you see that, Mrs Bonnar? -Mmm-hmm. DOCTOR: There, look, that's baby's head. And those two darker patches, they're the baby's eyes. And at just over three months, you can see baby's bone structure's developing very nicely indeed. And the heart muscles are working beautifully, too. -Look, do you see that? -MARIE: Yes, yes. That is just the most amazing thing. Isn't it? Now, would you like me to print out some of the ultra-sound images for you both? -Baby's first picture for the album. -Yeah, that'd be great. -Yeah. -I'll do a couple for you. Listen, I've been thinking... Why don't I come with you tomorrow, eh? I've always wanted to and it would do us both good to get away for a couple of days. -I'll be working. -Not all the time. Go on. Well... (CLEARS THROAT) It might be a wee bit difficult to rearrange things just now. What's to rearrange? -Aye, right. Aye, aye, sure. -Great. Who do you think he takes after? You or me? Oh, he? He might be a she. JOE: Oh, you can sense these things, can you? -I think so. You're supposed to. -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah. I'm reading it in this book. -(CHUCKLES) The soul incarnates at about this time. -That's when you're supposed to sense these things. -Christ's sake, Marie... The soul incarnates? You're making it sound like the Immaculate Conception. (SCOFFS) It's not far off. (BOTH LAUGH) (MOBILE RINGING) -Oh. -Oh. -That'll be the phone. -Oh, oh. WOMAN: Are you alone? -No. -No? No. In about five minutes. Bye just now. (CLEARS THROAT) I'll have to stop by the yard on the way home. Do you mind? No, why should I? Joe, Anderson's been round. He wants an answer. Well, I hope you told him where to go. It's a bit late for grand gestures. He's got you over a barrel on this one, Joe, and it has to be sorted. I know, Archie. I know. But I can't be dealing with it, not just now. For God's sake. Archie, I'll be seeing Anderson on Monday when I get up there. -(LINE RINGING) -All right. Hello. WOMAN: Hello? (SIGHS) Hello, Beth. I don't like you using my mobile number. It's too risky. BETH: I was thinking about you. JOE: I was thinking about you, too. You sound all out of breath. I'm fine. I'm fine. I need to give you a good going-over. Listen... I'll be around about nine o'clock, okay? All right. (PHONE DISCONNECTS) JOE: What's this? Weird, isn't it? Probably some chemical fault in the process and I sort of like the effect. A blue fog. It's like... It's like your guilty soul seeping away into the mist. Stop it, Beth! Or maybe it's the blue boy coming to get you. Joe! -Don't be stupid. -Why? Because it's just not funny, that's why. So the joke's worn a bit thin, has it? Yeah. And you don't find me funny either, do you, Joe? (EXHALES HEAVILY) There's no joy in it any more, Beth. For you or for me. Because of another bundle of joy? Because of another bundle of joy. (LIGHTER CLICKING) -Is that going to be enough? -Yeah, I'm not taking much. (SIGHS) All right, well, it's gonna be cold out there. Beautiful, though. And what are you gonna do? I mean, what are you gonna do when Joe's not there? You won't want to be dragged around the forest looking at trees, listening to him speak about timber prices and things like that. Not much of a holiday, surely. If I get bored, I can always do my own thing. Oh, darling... (SIGHS) -It'd be nice if you could spend a bit of time together. -We will, Mother! Will you stop worrying? But I do. I can't help myself. (SIGHS) Did you get everything sorted out? Mmm-hmm. Want to tell me about it? I'll tell you later. Promise? I promise. I promise. I promise. MARIE: Mmm. (MOANING) Don't get me going, don't. It's not fair. (KISSING) Are you sure you don't want me to paint that cradle for you? -I mean, I could at least put an undercoat on it just... -No, no, no. -...to start you off. -It's fine. I'll just give it a good scrub-down. I'd like to have something to do. Here, Marie. Oh! The Karma of Natural Childbirth. What planet are you on, for heaven's sake? -It's very good, Mother. -You need to get going to catch that ferry, Joe. And take care and don't bore her with timber prices! -Thanks, Mum. Bye. -Bye-bye. -All right. -Bye. Wait a minute. Hang on! Hang on! I found this on the hall carpet this afternoon. -Mom, we're due in Brighton. -It might be important. -Here. -Okay. Thanks a lot, Ma. -See you. Thank you. -Bye! -Cheers! -Bye now! Bye! Sorry about Ma. She's a wee bit over-excited just now, you know. This is you. "I'm sorry for you." What's this? Is this a threat of some kind? Has it something to do with work? I knew something like this would happen. It's all that bloody money, isn't it? What the hell have you done? I've done nothing. I've done nothing. Joe, we're gonna have to turn back and sort this out right now. -It's sorted out. -No... Well, what's this, then? It's... It's sorted. It's over. It's finished. There's nothing to worry about, darling, honestly. It's fine. I'm not having you being upset about it. Well, okay. Okay. (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (MUSIC PLAYING OVER CAR STEREO) (BRAKES SCREECHING) (EXHALES) Just a minute. Stay here! Oh, God, Joe! Oh, it's still alive! No, she's dying. Come on, take her head, help me pull her off the road. Hello! Looks as though it's clearing up for you. Pleasure to see you again. And you, too. Er, Marie, my wife. Of course. Now, let me show you both to your room. You shouldn't be disturbed by children this time, Mr Bonnar. We're very quiet, just now. In fact, you're our only guests. You'll have the place to yourselves. But things pick up around Christmas and Hogmanay. But at least the roads are quiet this time of year. No trouble on the way up, I hope? No. Well, we hit a deer on the way through which kind of delayed us a wee bit. You both all right? That must have shaken you up. They can do that though, can't they? They just spring out at you in the darkness. They certainly can. You're lucky not to go off the road. -Is the car all right? -Seems fine, aye. Well, it would be insensitive of me to offer venison on the menu... -Or to make jokes about stag nights, eh, Mrs Bonnar? -(CHUCKLES POLITELY) JOE: Do you have another double? I mean, I wasn't expecting to stay in this room. -I'm sorry I'm not with you. -Do you have another double? -No. -What's wrong with this one? I think it's lovely. I'm sorry. Have I misunderstood you? Er... No, no. Aye, this is great. This'll be fine. It'll be fine. Well, I'll see you both down in the bar for a nightcap. -Thanks. -Aye. So, do you want to come down for a drink or what? No. I'll just have a bath, or something. I just feel a bit... You go. See you in a wee while. Terribly sorry about that. So embarrassing. I just opened my mouth and put my foot right in it, didn't I? (CHUCKLES) No, no. It's on the house, please. Especially under the circumstances. Look, mum's the word from now on. I promise you that. Thanks. Slainte. (METAL PINGING) (MARIE SIGHS) (PINGING CONTINUES) (BANGING ON DOOR) (BANGING CONTINUES) (GASPS) (EXHALES) -Marie? -(WIND HOWLING) Listen. Can you hear it? There. What? It's the wind. Sounds like somebody crying. Come to bed, Marie. Come to bed. (MARIE SHIVERING) Christ, you're freezing. Relax, Joe. Your heart's beating like a sledgehammer. (EXHALES SHARPLY) I've been trying to remember when you came to stay with us before, Mr Bonnar. I'm very good with faces. Oh, got you now. It was when that photographer came down to do an article on the hotel. -Do you remember? -JOE: Uh-huh. -CHRISTINE: I told him then he was wasting his time. -Why's that? -Because photographs don't come out well here, generally. -Why? Oh! Before I forget... Someone rang for you. Wants you to ring them back as soon as possible. -I'll just be a minute. -MARIE: Okay. Congratulations, dear. Three? Three-and-a-half months, is it? -(CHUCKLES) Oh, I didn't think it was so obvious. -Oh. Perhaps not here, but your face is so radiant, I couldn't help but notice. (DIALLING PHONE) (PHONE RINGING) Hello, Beth. (STAMMERS) Marie! Come on! (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO) (SWITCHES OFF RADIO) (WIND HOWLING) They're out, Miss Clark. They've gone for a jaunt in the woods. -Hi, Joe. -Hi, Kenny. Er, this is Marie, my wife. -All right. I didn't know. How do you do? -Fine. Thanks. He's obviously in a rather awkward position. So let's try and be as discreet as possible. Of course. Poor woman. Oh... The Blue Boy and other stories... Keep them to yourself this time. That's hardly up to me, is it? JOE: Did you speak to Anderson? KENNY: Not since yesterday. -(MACHINERY WHIRRING) -JOE: How did he sound? KENNY: Uncompromising. (MOBILE RINGING) Hello? Hello? Can I speak to Joe please? No. He's not here just now. Can I take a message? No. -Can I ask who called? -No, er... Yeah. You could tell him that Beth rang. Do you want him to ring you back? He can ring me later. Oh, he's got my number. Oh, that's my money. (INAUDIBLE) (METALLIC SCREECHING) MAN: Joe! Joe! Listen, I think I'll just stay here. It gave me such a fright, I need some time to recover. I'm all right. -It's you I'm worried about. -I'm fine. You sure you won't get bored? No. All right then, I'll go on my way. (INHALES SHARPLY) Oh, God. (EXHALES) (SCOFFS) Why am I so stupid? Stupid! (LINE RINGING) BETH: (OVER ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi. Beth's not at home just now. But don't be down-hearted. You can leave a message after the tone. (BEEPING) Just to say that I feel sorry for you. "Our darling boy. Lost but never forgotten. "A. Clark." Robert, that fountain, is that a memorial or something? It's to a wee boy. He drowned in the loch, not far from here. God, that's awful. And the name, A. Clark? Was that his name? Oh, I don't think so. Family name or other. Is that a relative of Christine's? Her name's Clark. God knows, she likes to think so. Where is she? Um... Saturday afternoon... She's up at the church, practising. But, a word of warning before you go, Mrs Bonnar. Miss Clark's a remarkable woman, and very gifted in many ways, but her middle name's Hyperbole. Sorry? A pinch of salt, Mrs Bonnar. Okay, thanks. Bye. (CHURCH ORGAN PLAYING) -(STOPS PLAYING) -Oh! What a lovely surprise! Though I expect it means your husband's deserted you for his work. Men are such pigs. I had one once. It was the only disappointing period of my life. You'll know this one. (PLAYING O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM) Right. -Where's the Baby Jesus? -He's not due for another fortnight. We mustn't jump the gun. But we've got the shepherd, look. Watching his flocks by night. And Mary and Joseph, and the Angel Gabriel. -It's lovely. -The children put it up. They love this time of year. -Oh. You're in good company. -Oh. The last of a line, I'm afraid. -That's sad. -Well, yes, I suppose it is. I shouldn't admit it, being a woman. But after 400 years, it is sad. That wee boy who drowned was a Clark. Was he a relative, too? -A very close one. -I'm sorry. Oh, it was a long time ago, and of course, I never knew him... But I feel... Well, close to him in a special way. Do you understand? He was recovering from typhoid fever and he was convalescing with his parents in the hotel here. He was prone to sleepwalking, and one night he got out of his bed and wandered off looking for his mother. He went outside and fell from the jetty and drowned. In the morning, when his father found the body, it was quite blue with the cold. Oh, poor wee thing. (GASPS) Are you all right? Yeah. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (LAUGHING) Sorry. It was so weird when you were speaking there. It just was so vivid. (SIGHS) And I know what it's like... You lost a baby? I had a miscarriage. Oh, my dear... I'm so sorry. -I'm so sorry. -(SOBBING) And you cried for him then, didn't you? And you're crying now because you can feel him again. (DOOR OPENING) Thought you might like a lift. -Finished? -Mmm-hmm. -You all right? -Yeah. (METAL PINGING) (BANGING ON DOOR) She's taking you where? To church. (STAMMERS) Why? I feel like it. (ORGAN PLAYING) ALL: (SINGING) # O little town of Bethlehem # How still we see thee lie # Above thy deep and dreamless sleep # The silent stars go by. # Yet in thy dark streets shineth # The everlasting light... Shit. # O morning stars together # Proclaim the holy birth # And praises sing to God the King # And Peace to men on Earth # (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (PANTING) MARIE: Do you believe that we can learn from the past? CHRISTINE: The minister obviously thinks so. I don't know. MARIE: What do you think? CHRISTINE: I think that when the past mirrors the present, we should let it speak to us. And it does, all the time. If we'd only listen to it. You do listen, don't you, Marie? How do you mean? You're sensitive to these things. To the past. If you'd known me for longer, I don't think you'd be saying that. I didn't tell you everything yesterday, about the drowning. I wanted to be sure. Sure about what? You see, when his father found him, there were little wet footsteps leading all the way back into the hotel and into his parents' bedroom. You understand? He's still here, with us. Oh, Christine. (EXHALES) Why are you telling me this? This is horrible. Because I want you to help my little boy. (MOBILE RINGING) (PANTING) BETH: Hi, Joe? Can you hear me? Can you talk? What are you trying to do to me? I'm hurt, Joe. Aye. How do you think I feel? (SCOFFS) Hurt. I'm glad. -We feel the same way. -Marie knows. I know she does. She left a message on my answering machine. She did what? Isn't it better that she knows? Christ, Beth. What's the point of more hurt? It's a war, Joe. Don't you realise that? (SIGHS) (DOORKNOB CLICKS) We're going to have to talk, Marie. Are we? (SIGHS) We haven't had much time, have we? No. We haven't. So... -How much do you know? -"Know"? -About the last time I came here. -I don't want to hear this. But you know, Marie! You rang her! You left a message. I don't want to have this conversation, okay? Not now. For Christ sake, Marie. Give us a chance! You've had your chance, Joe! I don't wanna hear any more of your shite. But you have to know! (STAMMERS) I don't have to know anything! It's your business! It's not mine. I don't want to hear your sordid story until it becomes my business. And if it does, if it affects me or the baby in any way, you can just piss off out of here! You understand? You just piss off out of here! Oh, God, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do, my little one? (SLOSHING) -(GASPS) Oh! -I'm so sorry, Mrs Bonnar. -Oh, you gave me such as... -We seem to have sprung another leak. -Yes, sorry. -Sorry. (LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT BELL DINGING) (SIGHS) -Marie, I hope I didn't upset you unduly this morning. -Oh, no, Christine. -Don't mention it, it's fine. -I certainly didn't mean to. I can understand if you think... It's a strange story, I know... But if you'd lived with it as long as I have... Really, it's fine, Christine, honestly. He stayed in here... My blue boy. You can feel him too, can't you? Feel him? His presence. The memory of him. I've always felt that. Christine, why are you telling me this? You're making my flesh crawl. -Because you're close to him. -What do you mean? I can sense that he's close to you. It's only natural, though. He was looking for his mother when he died and now he's found you. Stop it, Christine! Please, stop it. I don't know what you're talking about and I don't want to hear it. I'm just... I'm sorry I'm not in the mood. Please understand. (BIRD SQUAWKS) (SIGHING) (LIGHTER CLICKING) (PHONE RINGS) -Joe? -MARIE'S MOTHER: Marie, darling? -Ma! -I know it's early, darling -but I can't... -Ma, is Joe there? No, of course not. Why? What's wrong, dear? He went out last night. Didn't come back. He hasn't called. I'll come up. This is serious. I don't want you up there all by yourself... No, Ma. You're better off where you are in case he does drop in. And Ma, if he does, break his neck for me, will you? -Why? -No. I'll ring you later. Don't worry. (SIGHS) Oh, God. (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGS) (ANSWERING MACHINE ACTIVATES) -BETH ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi. -Hello? -Beth's not at home, just now. -Ah! Damn thing. -But don't be downhearted. -Hello? -You can leave a message. -(CHUCKLES) Sorry about that, Beth here. Could I speak to Joe, please? -Who is that? -Who do you think it is? Now could I speak to Joe? He's not here. I don't know where he is. -You're lying to me. -I might be. -You can't be sure, can you? -Put him on. Why would he want to speak to you? Put him on! There's no point. He's got nothing to say. That's not true. Believe what you like. I know how he feels. And you don't. And you can't. Because you can't trust him. Joe! Joe! -(YELLING) You bastard! -For Christ's sake, Marie! -(SOBBING) -For Christ's sake, Marie. MARIE: Don't touch me! Don't you touch her! You leave her alone! Piss off! (SOBBING) -Marie... -You bastard! Marie, I'm sorry. If you lie to me, I'll kill you! (WIND WHOOSHING) What are we going to do? (SNIFFLES) I think we should stay together. (CAR DOOR OPENS) (SNIFFLES) (SIGHS) I know it hasn't been said for a long time, Marie... But I love you. How do I know that? I'm scared, Marie. For us. KENNY: Hey, Joe! Damn it. Kenny. I'd forgotten. Uh... Are you gonna be all right for an hour? Will you? -I'll follow you. -Alright. (AIR HISSING THROUGH PIPES) -MARIE: Robert. -Oh. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Mrs Bonnar. You scared me. I was miles away. This is incredible! What is this? Is this the reason I've got no water? It is. I've never seen anything like it in my life. The water pipe is ruptured all over the place. It's bloody weird. (CONTINUES SHOVELLING) It's beautiful. It's probably the Blue Boy. (SCOFFS) Christine and her mumbo jumbo! Aye, but it's a tragic story, right enough. It's a sordid story. What do you mean, sordid? I thought the wee boy was recovering from an illness. He was. But his father wasn't. He was a notorious womaniser and was having it off with his son's nurse while his mother was sick at home in Glasgow. I bet Miss Clark didn't tell you that. She didn't want to tarnish the family name. (DOOR CLOSING) -Pint, Mr Bonnar? -Is Marie about? I think she's taking a nap upstairs. Aye, all right, I'll have a pint of IPA, thanks. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Kiran! Kiran, come back! (INDISTINCT BANGING) Marie? Marie? (SOFTLY) It was a dream. But it was stronger than a dream, though. I'd... (SIGHS) I'd come up to clean up but there was no water. So... I laid down to read and then I started thinking about us. And... I must have dropped off, I don't know. Then I felt someone come into the room. I thought it was you but I couldn't turn round and then I knew it couldn't be you. It was a child. He was terribly unhappy. Part of me wanted to go to him but his loneliness was just so frightening. And then he... Got in beside me. I could feel the bedclothes move, I felt his little sharp knees in the small of my back. Then I woke up. I'm frightened. (SOBBING) Oh, my God, Marie! -Oh, my God! -Joe, you've felt him too, haven't you? I thought it was just me... (BREATHING SHAKILY) I thought... My imagination. I want to leave. All right. All right, we'll go now. We'll get... We'll get packed. Come on. We'll get packed. -Right? -Uh-huh. Here's your bag. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Shite. -There's someone to see you. -I can't. Not just now. I really think you should. Marie. I'll be right back, okay? Okay. (DOOR CLOSES) Joe, I had to. No, you didn't. Listen to me, Joe, I need to speak to you! Leave me alone! If you don't leave me alone, I'll scream! And I will too, Joe. I really need to speak to you. All right. But not here. -(UNZIPS BAG) -(CAR ENGINE STARTS) (EXCLAIMS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Oh, where's Joe? Who came for him? Er...what's his name? Kenny. I am sorry. We were happy, weren't we? Christ, Beth! (CLICKS TONGUE) That's not the point, not any more. But it's the only thing that counts, Joe. (SCOFFS) Don't make the mistake of thinking that you can make Marie happy by denying your own. (KIRAN'S VOICE ECHOES) Mother! I'm here, Mother! (PHONE RINGS) -MARIE: Joe? -Are you okay? -Where are you? -I'm on my way. I can't stand it here any longer. I'll be there as soon as I can. And, Marie... I do love you, Marie. -Are you still there? -Yes, Joe. -You just take care. -Yeah. I'll be all right. Bye, then. Bye. I love you. (SIGHS) (SIGHS DEEPLY) (WINDSCREEN WIPER WHIRS) (KIRAN'S VOICE ECHOES) Mother, I'm here, Mother. (TIRES SCREECHING) (CRASHING) MARIE: (SCREAMING) Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! (GASPING) Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! (SCREAMS) (INDISTINCT KIDS CHATTERING) (PHONE RINGS) MARIE'S MOTHER: It's all right, dear. I'll get it. Hello? Miss Clark? Oh, yes. Hello. No, she's not here. Yes, she's fine, and the baby. There's nothing wrong with her. (CHUCKLES) Yes, that's right. A lovely baby boy. (BABY GURGLES)
