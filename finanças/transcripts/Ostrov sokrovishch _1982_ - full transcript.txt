A high mark on the shoulder of a telescope. Direction north of north northeast. Skeleton Island east-southeast and east. Silver bars in the northern pit. You will find it on the slope of the southeast hill. Dreaming of an upcoming voyage, I spent many hours on a map of the island and memorized it. In my imagination, I swam a thousand times to the island from different directions. Sometimes, he was teeming with savages, and we had to fight back from them. Sometimes, some strange creatures inhabited him, and we had to fight them. But all these imaginary adventures turned out to be nothing, compared with those strange, tragic adventures that actually happened. Spyglass Tavern, don't get distracted. Us here. Oh, John Silver. Are you Mr. Silver? Yes boy. My name is Silver. And who are you? I'm Jim Hawkins. Oh, so you are our new Jung. Hello. Black Dog?! Hold it! Hurry up! This is the Black Dog! He will run away. Rather. Wait a minute. Grab it. This is the Black Dog. Where are you under the carriage? Silver! Why, this is the Black Dog. Quickly catch up with him. He will leave. Well, you all are sitting. Catch up with him soon. He is the Black Dog, you see. I ask you. Catch up with him. I don't give a damn what his name is. He escaped and did not pay me for a drink. The black! Gary! Gary! Gary, get him. How did you say his name? Black, and then ... Black Cat? Dog. Ugh, Dog. Didn't Mr. Trelawney tell you about our robbers? No. So he is from their gang. What? Yes. What in my house? O'Brien, you seem to be sitting at the same table with him. Have you never seen this Black Dog before? Never sir. And didn’t even hear his name? Sir did not hear. You look at me, O'Brien. If you are confused with such villains, your feet will no longer be in my institution. Never sir. What was he talking about with you here? What was he talking to us about? So I ask you, what was he talking to you about? I don’t remember well, sir. I don’t remember well. And can you call your head what is on your shoulders? No sir. You probably spoke with him about swimming ... About swimming. About ships ... About ships. About captains ... About capitals ... We spoke with him about captains. Which are hung on a ray. Oh John, Gary caught him. Nobody has left Gary yet. Is he? No. Then I do not know. Listen, Hawkins. For me, all this can end badly. What will Captain Smollett think of me? It’s not my fault that this damned Dutchman was drinking my drink. If I were a first-class sailor, as in the good old days. Then he would not have left me. Explain to him that I could not keep up with him on one leg. And money? For 3 circles, here is the devil. I forgot about the money. Oh, I can’t. Sir, Captain Smollett wants to talk to you. I am always at the services of a captain. Please ask him here. I beg. Well tell me, Captain Smollett. Hope everything is alright? Is the schooner ready to sail? That's what, sir. I will speak frankly, even at the risk of quarreling with you. I do not like this expedition. I do not like your sailors. I do not like my assistant. That's all, short and clear. Perhaps sir, you do not like the schooner as well? I can’t say anything about her, sir, until I see her swimming. At first glance, it is built well. But it’s too early to talk about it now. Then, sir, perhaps you do not like your master? Uh, wait, wait, wait. Something but a quarrel, nothing will come of it. Captain ... You said ... Too much and too little. We ... have the right to demand an explanation. You said that you do not like our expedition. Why? You see, sir. I was invited to bring the ship wherever I wish, this gentleman. But ... did not name the purpose of the trip. Soon, I became convinced that the latest sailor knew more about the purpose of the expedition than I did. In my opinion, this is ugly. What do you think? In my opinion, too. Then I find out that we are going to search for treasures. Moreover, note, I learn this from my subordinates. And to seek treasures is a delicate matter. And then, treasure hunting is not my part at all. I am not attracted to such activities. Moreover, these classes are secret. And the secret ... I beg your pardon, Mr. Trelawney, I’m wiped out, so to speak, a parrot. Is Silver scared? N-yes ... This is a saying, sir. Ahhh. Which means that the secret is no longer a secret. It seems to me that you underestimate the difficulties of the case you undertook. I will tell you what I think about it. You have to fight not for life, but to death. Why do you think we hired insufficiently experienced sailors? I do not like them. And speaking of cleanliness, the recruitment team should have been entrusted to me. I do not argue, do not argue. Of course, my friend should have hired a team with you. Yes sir, yes. But I assure you, there is nothing intentional. And now, captain, tell me bluntly what you need from us? Have you firmly decided to go on this voyage, gentlemen? Irrevocably. Fine. If you still listened to me patiently, although I said things that I could not prove. Listen further. I beg you, captain. Weapons and gunpowder are stacked in the bow of the vessel. Although, under this cabin there is a wonderful room. Why not put them there? This is the first. Then, you took three servants with you. I heard that some of them are also going to be placed in the bow. And why not give them beds near your cabin. This is the second. Is there a third? There is. Chatting too much. Yes, chatting too much. I’ll give only what I heard with my own ears. They say that you have a map of some island, and the crosses on it indicate the places where the treasures are buried. And that this island is here. I did not say this to any person. However, every sailor knows this, sir. Was it you, Livesey, who blabbed it all? Now it’s all the same who blabbed. Captain, Smollett, when you came here, I thought you would demand a lot more from us. You see, sir. I did not hope that Mr. Trelawney would hear at least one of my words. And I would not listen. If not for Livesey, I would immediately send you to hell. But be that as it may, I have listened to you and will do everything you require. Perfectly. However, my opinion of you has changed for the worse. And this is as you please, sir. In the future, you will understand that I have only fulfilled my duty. Here is Captain Flint. I named it after the famous pirate. He predicts that our voyage will end successfully. Right, captain? You know, he’s about 200 years old. Yes ... parrots live forever. He swam with Inglind. The famous ... captain Inglind, a pirate. Ah, what he saw in his lifetime. Right, flint? To Rhea, To Rhea. Do you hear Put everyone up in the yard. And what do you want? You will live among the tar, involuntarily get dirty. He swears like a thousand devils, but does not understand anything that he says. I have a great sailor. Piastres. Pirates, pirates. Our squire, doctor, captain. Oh, and here is Jim. Listen to Silver, go to the galley. And make sure people get dinner on time. Yes, sir. Silver, the whole team for a portion of the pudding. Yes, sir. Nice fellow, our cook. Very possible. I just can’t say that I like him. Well, Jim, how are you? Jung to me. Are you calling me sir? Get up! That's what a young man on the ship, all the commands are executed without talking and just running. Clear? Yes, sir. Go to the galley. There you will find a job. Yes, sir. I will not tolerate pets on board. Yes, sir. Live, guys, live, live. Faster Faster. Silver, they started something. Joyce, Hunter and Redrut carry weapons from the bow to the stern. They sniffed something. Guys, what are you doing? John, they carry weapons. I see it myself. Why the hell? Silver! What's the matter? So, after all, we miss the low tide, sir. They carry out the order of the captain. And the captain here is me. Did you understand? Yes, sir. In places! For work to all. For the work. In places! Way to John. Excuse me sir, are we going there, or there? You boob, Joyce. Thank you sir. You are welcome. Oh, more fun guys, more fun. Oops! How, Dick Pastor, will you soon become a thunderstorm of the seas? All with God's help. Come on. Sea storm. To clear. Dikkosch to poison. Tapinat take it! Have fun tapinat. I told you, wild goat poison. We poison little by little, we poison. Come on, more fun, come on. I will not describe the details of our trip. It was very successful. The ship was exemplary. The team consisted of experienced sailors. The captain knew his job perfectly. But before we reached Treasure Island, there were events worth mentioning. For a long time we will still wag like marketing boats. I swear by thunder, I was tired of the captain to death. Stop commanding him! I want to live in his cabin. I need their pickles and wines. That's what, Hanks. You will be courteous. You won’t drink a drop of wine until I tell you the right word. So when, when will you say that word, Silver? When? As late as possible, when. I saw a lot of young people who were hanged to dry in the sun. And why? Why? But because they were in a hurry. In a hurry. In a hurry. You were a captain, and I was a quartermaster. Because I lost my leg in the same way that old Pugh lost his portholes. Our ship, his name was Walrus, was full of blood to the brim. And there was so much gold in him that he almost went to the bottom. Oh, what a fellow, this Flint. Yes, but the main thing, after all, is not in the ability to earn money, but in the ability to save. Where are the people of Flint now? But mostly here on the ship. We are glad when they are served this pudding. And on the shore they almost died of hunger, by God. So be a pirate ... Don't be a fool. So always with the gentlemen of luck. But I am doing wrong. I put all my money at interest in different banks. But nowhere do I put too much so as not to arouse suspicion. I am 50 years old. But after this swimming I will live like a real gentleman. And he started as a sailor like you. But your previous money will now be lost? How do you see yourself in Bristol after this voyage? Where do you think my money is? In Bristol, in banks and other places. They were there. But now my old woman took all the money from the bank. "Spyglass" is sold, and the old woman is waiting for me in the appointed place. Do you trust your old woman? Gentlemen of fortune rarely trust each other. But you won’t fool me. The one who lowers the rope so that old John will blur out will not live long. Some were afraid of Pugh. Others were afraid of Flint. And Flint himself was afraid of me. He was afraid of me and proud of me. I will tell you honestly. Prior to this conversation, John, your business was not at all to my liking. But now ... I like your business, I agree. You are a very brave fellow. And not very stupid. A great gentleman of luck will come out of you. Such as I have not even met. Do you want a pie? Thank. Go down the hold, Dick, catch a rum. Well, how are you, John? Good deeds. Dick is already ours. I knew that he would be with us. He’s not a fool, this is Dick. But Alan and Tom do not agree. What to do with them? Do not you know? And where? On the island. Land! Earth, earth. Doctor, I found out a terrible thing. What? I need to talk to you in private. Jim, buddy, go to my cabin and bring me my pipe. Good. Captain, I ask you to come down. Hanks, get the team together. Is everyone gathered? I want to tell you. You see the earth in front of you. This land is the island to which we sailed. John Silver terrified me so terrified of his cruelty, his duplicity, his power over the ship's command, that I shuddered when he screamed at the top: "Hurray, Captain Smollett." But the sailors picked up this cry so cordially and amicably that, I confess, I doubted at that moment Silver's cunning plans. And what will we do with them when they fall into our hands? This man is to my taste. He’s not talking about trifles, but about business. Well, what will we do with them? We will land them on some deserted shore, or slaughter them like pigs. That's what Flint would do. Yes, Flint was a master at this. “The dead don't bite,” he used to say. He is dead. Now he himself checks this saying on himself. And I am a generous man. But I understand duty above all. Therefore, I vote - to kill. Here it is in our opinion. Hooray, Silver! Cheers cheers! No, no, no. I suppose we should all drink to Jim's health. For his courage, and for his ingenuity. Yes captain. You were right, but I am wrong. I admit myself a donkey. And I'm waiting for your orders. From all that I heard, I drew some conclusions, and if Mr. Trelawney allows me to present them to you. You are the captain here, sir. First, we must ... Yes. Mr. Smollett, gunpowder has disappeared from the hold. Give me the squire Trelawney, I want to chop off his calf’s head with my own hands. That’s all, gentlemen, that I can offer you. We must be on guard and wait for the opportunity. Jim can do the most good for us. His sailors are not shy, and he is a smart boy. Hawkins, I rely on you completely. That's what, young ... get the boatswain here. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. What are you doing here, son? The captain urgently calls the boatswain. Boatswain, get ready to lower the sails and anchor. Boatswain, I’m used to having my orders executed at lightning speed. Are you numb, boobies? Lively execute commands. In places! Crutch, John! They are tired, sir. Yes. That's what, John. After they have anchored, lower the boats. And let those of the team who want to go ashore. Great, sir. Yes, you know, after a three-week voyage, a walk on hard ground will not hurt. I see, sir. Yes, sir. So, another minute and our ship. Where is jim Hanks, O'Brien. You two will take three more and stay here. Watch me both. John, can you fool me? I swear! Without realizing the captain’s plans, I suddenly decided on the first of desperate acts that later saved us from death. I reasoned like this: We cannot capture the ship, since Silver left the six thieves; On the other hand, since there are only six of them left, it means that I am not needed on the ship now. And I sneaked into the first boat. However, Silver, who was sitting in another boat, noticed me, and then I ... wished I had gone. Jim! Jim! Faster. Jim! Jim! Well, captain, so far so good. Jim slipped into the boat and drove along with the pirates to the shore. How? Ah boy. He foiled all our plans. I did not expect this from him. So now there are six of us. Well, now we have one way out - to leave the ship. I suggest visiting this fort. Perhaps he will serve us as a good defense. Wow, this is a real fortress. Who raised it, I can’t say, but the fact that any siege can be sustained in it is certain. I was at war, Hunter, and I've seen a lot of things. And here is what I will tell you. Beyond the walls of this fort, I feel more confident than in the cabin of our squire. See Doctor. John, what does it mean whispering and whispering? It's time to reveal the cards and stop playing the dark. I think it was you who laid us the captain. Leave him. Leave me alone. Leave him! Don’t be afraid, Alan. Do not touch it. This is that, Silver. Tom. Tom, do you really think I would bother you if I didn’t love you with all my heart. Silver, you are no longer a young man, as if you have a conscience. At least no one considers you a fraud. Answer me. I will answer. I want to save your neck, that's why I'm here with you. Do you have money. Besides, you are not a coward. So answer me. I will answer. You know what the sailors would do to me if they knew what I’m talking to you about here. So tell me why you mess with these vile rats. I will answer. Yes, I’ll rather let it cut off my hand, but I won’t betray my duty. It was Alan's voice. Peace be upon him. He died like a real sailor. I will not break my duty. Oh, Tom. You killed Alan, so kill me if you can. But know, I'm not afraid of you. Jim call. Look for a boy. Look for the boy! Who are you? Ben Gunn. And you? Jim. Jim? Jim. Jim, I haven’t spoken to anyone for three years. Three years? Are you shipwrecked? No buddy. They left me ... People ... On the island. Come on, doctor. Quiet, Quiet. Mr. Trelawney, as it turned out, among the pirates ... Caution gunpowder. There is one reliable person. Who is this? I want to try talking to him. This is Abraham Gray Loyd. It seems they overheard us. Hands, they unload weapons. There. Behind me. Back! I appeal to you, Abraham Gray. I leave the ship and invite you to follow your captain. In essence, you are a good person. And the rest are not as bad as they want to seem. Therefore, I count to three. One ... Two ... I'm waiting, Gray. Three ... No, captain! Thrown on this island three years ago. Since then I have been eating goat meat, berries, oysters. It may be for the best that I ended up on this island, Jim. I thought a lot here alone. And he became rich. Yes, yes, Jim, a rich man. I will make a man of you too. However, do you have a piece of cheese with you? No. For long nights, I see in a dream cheese on a slice of bread. I wake up, but there is no cheese. Tell me the truth, young. Isn't Flint a ship? No, not Flint. He died. But there are several Flint's comrades on the ship. This is a great misfortune for us. But is there one-legged among them? Silver? Yes, Silver. Silver, Silver, Silver. He is our cook and runs the whole gang. If you are sent by the treacherous John, I am lost. Do not be afraid. They shoot there. We are running. We are running. Jim, wait. The boat ... got ready ... fire. Started. This is Flint's best gunner. Who is our best shooter? Mr. Trelawney, no doubt. Mr. Trelawney, I ask you, please, shoot one of the robbers. A ray of all hands. Just be careful not to flip the skiff. Look, they are now chasing us. Add to the move. Lean on the oars, which is strength. If we do not get to the shore now, we will have to be tight. And time ... Fire! Hold on. Save gunpowder. Oh God, what a heat. I'm almost dry now. Throw the bag. Does anyone have a rope or hook? Let's look now. We need to get a barrel. Redruth, get down. What? What? Who is it? Rather, gentlemen. No matter how they overtake us. Goal. Thank god sir. We were so worried about you. Close the gate! Redruth! Sir. Forgive me old friend. Doctor, am I dying? I wish I had one more bullet before them. Tom, are you forgiving me? How can I forgive or not forgive? I am your servant. Come what may. I, Alexander Smollett - the captain, David Livesey - the ship's doctor, Abraham Gray - the assistant to the carpenter, John Trelawney - the owner of the vessel, John Hunter and Richard Joyce - fellow countrymen of the squire and his servants, these are all who remained faithful to duty. Taking with you supplies that are enough for no more than a week. We landed and occupied a fort, in which we hope to withstand attacks with greater success than on a ship, against the three times superior forces of robbers. Our losses: Tom Redruth, who fell like a hero. And ... Listen, that scream that you heard in the forest. Do you think it was our young? Before death, all voices are the same. Live Jim Hawkins would be with us now. And young Jim Hawkins. Two. Hold on Jim. You see which one. If you need him, you can always find him here, under the rock. Caution. Run, Jim, run. My boy, run. Rather. Listen, your friends are there. I won’t go there with you. Ben Gunn is cunning, you know that. Ben Gunn guy is not a miss. Listen, you say your squire is a true gentleman. And he will thank the man who help you out of trouble. But I have to be sure that he will take me home. Tell them that I will not stay in debt. They will not regret it. But I must see one of them myself, and let him give me his gentleman's word. Let one man come and let there be something white in his hand. Listen ... Tell them ... That I accept 12 to 6 bottles. Ben Gunn is not a member of parliament and is not the chief judge, but he also has hours ... of reception. Listen, Jim. I think you're a nice guy. If you meet John Silver, you will not sell Ben Gunn? I never sell anyone. Look at both, Joyce. Excuse me, sir, but if I see anyone, should I shoot? Captain, while everything is calm. Oh, of course, Joyce. Thank you sir. Even if you are tied to the tail of a wild horse. Do not give out? I will not betray. Take it. Caution, it is poisonous. Wait, I'm shooting. Wait, shoot! Captain! Captain! Hand ... Jim, alive. Jim! Doctor! Jim, oh, and you made us worry. Forgive me, captain. Well, let's go, let's go. Tell me. Jim, do you think you can rely on this Ben Gunn? I do not know. But, in my opinion, his head is not quite in order. It may very well be. If a person has lived on a desert island for three years, his head cannot help but suffer. Listen, Jim, but you didn’t realize what he wanted to tell us? No sir. But it seems to me that something is very important. Yes. We missed them, John. And all of you. "Wait until I say the right word." We, like moles, will dig this island for 10 years, until we die. The treasure is here somewhere, I know for sure. Here "- where exactly? Here in the swamp? Or there, in the mountains? They are sitting in a fortress and counting piastres. We must storm this damned fort. And select the card. Do you want your bad heads to bore you? They are sitting in safe shelter. They have about 20 muskets. Some will charge, while others will lay you on the spot. Well? Who is in a hurry to the next world? Please, others will get more. Well, what if the attack fails? Have you seen how this damn squire shot from the swinging boat the Ring head? What about the doctor? What about the captain? What about Abraham Gray? I’ll drag him back on the rope like a shark bait. No, damn offspring, if you chose me as the leader of your gang, so listen to what I tell you. Oh, missed. Who is our guard. Gary, call him. Poisoned Arrow. Poor Jack. Some of them are well versed in these weapons. Until we are all shot here individually, tomorrow at dawn we attack the fort. Avenge Jack. White flag. What a disgrace. A couple of bottles will not be beaten away, as the Jolly Rogers will fly over this fort. I swear to Flint's skeleton. Captain, white flag. I bet they start some trick. Come on, come on, Jim. Doctor, please take the north side. Gray is eastern. Hunter - Western. All the rest charge the muskets and follow in both. The devil knows what they are up to. Hey, what's up? Captain Silver, sir, wants to board you. And conclude an agreement with you. Captain Silver? I do not know this. And who is it? And that is me, sir. Our unfortunate guys chose me as captain because you deigned to desert. But we are ready to obey you. But, of course, on certain conditions. Give me your word that you will not open fire while we are talking with you. I have no desire to talk with you. If you want to talk to me, step here. It's enough. You can believe your word. I ask you to. Well, tell me, dear. Sit down. Not a hunt to sit in such a sun. Let me in the house, captain. No, Silver, or you are my ship chef, then I'm talking to you for good. Or you are Captain Silver, a rebel, a pirate, then do not expect anything from me except the gallows. Okay, only then you have to give me a hand, so that I can rise. Oh Jim, and you are here. My respect, doctor. And our squire himself, in person. Good morning, gentlemen. To the point, my dear. Tell me why you came. Right, sir. First of all. You made a smart thing tonight. We were shocked. Here is what I will tell you. We want to find treasures. And find them. And you want to save your life. We can agree. I know you have a map. Maybe. Yes ... And here are our conditions: you give us a card, and we have two options to choose from. First, having loaded onto the ship what Flint hid here, we allow you to go on deck. And I give my word, we will deliver you somewhere safe and sound. Or else, you stay on the island. Food, we leave exactly half of the reserves of "Hispaniola". And I promise you to send here the first oncoming ship. Clearly I set out? It's all? Not really. And remember, if you do not fulfill my conditions, then our guns will speak instead of me. Great, Silver. Now listen to me. If you, alone, are unarmed, come here. I undertake to shackle you and bring you to justice. If you don’t come, please remember that my name is Alexander Smollett. And I intend to send all of you to the devil. You will not find treasures. You cannot sail away on the ship, because none of your gang can control the ship. You have run aground, Captain Silver. And soon you will leave her. And know, at the next meeting, I will put a bullet in your back. Get out, my dear. Hurry up. So ... Well, who will give me a hand so I can rise? Who will give me a hand? I'll leave. But know that I will soon, this fort, heat up like a barrel of punch. Laugh, laugh. Another moment and those of you who survive, envy the dead. He warms us up like a barrel of punch. Joyce, where should you be? There you are, on the west side. Go east. Excuse me, sir, but if I see anyone, what ...? I'm sorry, what? Sorry. Now in the east, then in the west. I remember very well that in the east. Quiet, Quiet. Sorry, sir, but it’s ordered that I shoot someone. So shoot. Who's stopping you? Anxiety. Anderson, our Gary was completely stagnant. Well, scare them. Quiet. Nothing, I see nothing. Well, what are they doing? They will kill each other. Gary, I'm running, I tell you. Be careful, be careful. Well, Jim? He ran back. You can’t fool the crafty Job. Job! Job, gunpowder. Take off Job, drop the boy. Throw it. Job! Curse to tear you apart. Where? Back! Where are you going? Back pigs back! Hunter is dead. Livesey, the captain is wounded. I will bandage you. Thank you Doctor. Did everyone run away? All who could. But five will never run again. To five. Well, not so bad. But after all, we became three people less. Thus ended the second day of our stay on the island. Brought us so much misfortune. On this day I especially acutely felt longing for my native places. In the old Admiral Benbow tavern, where my mother was waiting for me. Not even suspecting what dangers her son was exposed to.
