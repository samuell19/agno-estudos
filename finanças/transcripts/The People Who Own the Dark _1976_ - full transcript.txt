THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE DARK Lily. Lily. Lily. Get up. Bird! Bird! Good day, sir. Do you have the documents to hand over the merchandise? Here they are, sir. - Are you sure no one knows about this? - Absolutely, sir. No one. Very good. I want you to take them to Cairo to get them signed... ...and bring them back on Tuesday. - I'll do what I can, sir. - Tuesday. Will you sign, sir? - Have a good weekend. - Thank you. We'll meet on Tuesday. Bird! - Did you send the telegrams? - Yes, this morning. I prepared everything. - Dr. Robertson. - Yes? - Dr. Messier is here to see you. - Good, have him come in. Brendan, how are you? I'm great. What are you doing here, checking my work? No, only admiring it. You aren't a bad surgeon, Messier. I had a great teacher. Nonsense, you're much better than I ever was... ...which is no bad thing. Edward, you smoke too much. Those cigarettes will end up killing you. I suppose so, we all have to die of something... ...and I expect I'll die of something pleasant. Do you know something? Since you've given up tobacco you've become unbearable. Alright, alright, don't exaggerate. - Do you know the husband? - Yes, quite a character. He came here to visit me... ...while you were performing open heart surgery on his wife... ...just to make sure you'd leave her breasts where they belonged. I can imagine what he said. "Please don't leave one higher than the other". - She was born that way! - Of course, God, in his wisdom. - Dominus vobiscum... - Et cum spiritu tuo. - Let's get going. - This enormous body of mine... ...I don't know if I'll be able to get it up. Let's go, we have a great day ahead of us. You wretch! I thought you had said you'd bring me more Germans! - That gentlemen is Austrian. - I don't care! Why are you yelling, you're going to wake him up. We've done our job. - Then he'll sign the contract? - What do I know? - That's your business. - What happened? Are you sure you want to know? Forget it, the money will be deposited in... ...your bank account. And if, and if I have to call you for another shipment like this... I'm sorry, we're busy this weekend. But then what am I supposed to do? Replace us as best you can. Ciao! Goodbye! Yes, yes Comrade Minister. I think I understand you correctly. We'll take the necessary measures. Yes, yes. Thank you, Comrade. Our plans have changed Vasily. I have to go back home. I have to leave right away. - I think the current situation... - Is it that serious? No, it's really not... ...but we must suppose they want to give the impression... ...something is going to happen... ...but nothing will, I assure you, nothing will happen... ...but I won't be able to go to Vilmore. Would you mind replacing me? - Sir, I... - You'll have a good time, you'll see. If you say so. - What must I do regarding Fulton? - Absolutely nothing. Just repeat our offer if the opportunity presents itself. - Fulton is a cynic. - Yes. He's not interested in either us or them. It's possible, but he's still one of the world's best scientists. These things take time Vasily, and things change. They always change, that's something we can be sure of. Any questions? Don't move, just a moment. Yes? - Luna, it's for you. - Excuse me. Thank you, Tanya. Yes? It already arrived, at last! You don't say, and Lelo? He said that? Ok, thanks. What did the telegram say? - Yippee, everything's arranged. - Oh, yes! What's wrong with you this morning? I'm tired of the life we have to endure. - It's the only one we have. - Yes, but it isn't enough for me. And Drs. Messier and Robertson? They called, they'll be here this afternoon. - Good. - Oh, and the Ambassador called. He won't be able to come... ...but he's sending someone, an assistant or something. Have you heard from Professor Fulton? No, he hasn't said when he'll come. And the girls? Well, Sylvia won't be able to come... ...but Clara will bring a new girl, she's very formal according to her. - Let's hope so. - She's assured me. - What of Luna and Tanya? - No problems there, they'll both come. - What's the new girl's name? - Marian. Marian... So we have... Clara, Marian, let me remember... Tanya, and the dark skinned one, Luna. That's only four, which is missing? Berta said she'd come, too. Berta. Why hadn't you told me before Victor? Hello Bruno. Come on, let's go play... ...but don't scratch me. Hello? Hello Mother, it's me, Berta. The kids are up in arms. Thomas is traveling, yes, selling insurance in Marseille. Listen, something unexpected came up. Mother, I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind having a visit... ...from your two marvelous grandchildren. Thank you. Yes, I'll be back Monday. Don't worry. Alright. I'll have them there in an hour. Alright. Thanks, Mother. Goodbye, Mother. May god repay you. Miss? Welcome aboard partner. Another round, what will you have? - I'll have vodka, if you have any. - Yes, we have everything here. - I'm Clara. - And I'm Marian. And I'm Luna, this is Tanya. Luna, I've seen you somewhere, your face is familiar. Of course, you were... ...on the cover of the Paris Vogue... last month. - Welcome girls. - Hello. Hello Clara, I'm glad you're here. You've brought a new friend. Lily, this is Marian, Marian, Lily. Delighted to meet you. - You're very pretty. - Thank you. I'm sure Clara has explained the sort of reunions we have. I'm happy to be here. I've always wanted a job like this. If you have any questions ask Clara, complaints to Victor or me. Alright. Very pretty. - Hello Luna. - Hello Lily. It's been a long time since I've seen you. Strange woman. She knows what she's doing very well. - Clara! - Berta! Berta, let me introduce my best friend Marian. Marian, this is Berta. - Hello. - Delighted. Excuse me. I'm happy to see you, I thought you'd never come around here again. - I need the money. - And you and Lily...? No, I need money, that's all. - But, Lily..? - I think she'll understand. I'll try to fix things. Don't worry, I can manage it. - Professor Fulton? - Yes? No no, we've been told to tell you to call your office, it's urgent. Very well, I understand. Thank you very much. - A glass of brandy. - Very well. - Where's the telephone? - Here sir, come. - There it is. - Thank you. The number you have chosen is 382199. This is Blue Bird, what's going on? Fulton, something has happened, come back immediately. Great, something always has to happen. The other side has made a new move... ...many key ambassadors have gone home for the weekend. They've done that four times in the last six years. We need you here. Listen, two things could happen: First, it's a bluff in which case my going back there... ...to make everyone calm down won't get anyone to calm down. Or secondly, it's serious. - And if it were? Then there'd be nothing that could stop them. Understood, so long. Thank you. Welcome Professor Fulton. Hello Victor, delighted to see you again. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Don't worry... ...the other guests are waiting in the salon. Please. - How's it going, Dr. Robertson? - Hello, Fulton. - Dr. Messier. - Delighted to see you again. - Sit down, keep playing. - Thank you. Thank you Victor. Has the ambassador arrived? No, he said that a collaborator of his would come in his place. I think it's an assistant... ...his name is Vasily Seriakov or something like that. - If you'll excuse me? - Yes, of course. Good evening. I'm Bill Fulton. Forgive me Professor Fulton... ...my name is Vasily Seriabrakov, delighted to meet you It's the first time you've come here? I've supposed you've done it to have fun. That's my intention. Those two gentlemen are doctors. The younger is Dr. Robertson, a great surgeon... ...and a great chess aficionado as well. The other is his colleague, Dr. Messier. They're both important, famous and expensive. Checkmate. You've won again. The one over there is the famous Mr. Warner... ...adventurer and man of great wealth. He's been everything from a soldier in the Foreign Legion... ...to a drug trafficker. Mr. Warner. Mr. Fulton, I see you honor us once again. - With your agreeable presence. - Thank you. - Do you know Vasily Seriabrakov? - Delighted, sir... ...and I hope you'll be able to appreciate pleasure like ourselves, without limits. Of course, I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Gentlemen, would you be so kind as to go to your rooms please? Let's go. Thank you. - What's your name? - Greta, sir. - Greta. - Would you like something sir? - A bottle of whiskey. - There's a bar in the room... ...with your favorite brand. - That's magnificent, thank you. It's time, are you ready? Yes, everything's fine, I'll be right down. Excuse me, you have to wear the mask. Oh yes, of course. Please. Dear friends, welcome to Vilmore. Even those who are here for the first time... ...know what this word means and what is offered here... ...the great ceremony of pleasure. Once here, prejudices, convictions... ...compassion and even doubts... ...must be put aside. I expect you to be pitiless in satisfying your desires... ...they will transform you into true disciples of our great master. Donatien Alphonse Fran√ßois, Marquis de Sade. Five young women have been chosen to join us for this meal. If during, before or after the repast... ...any of the guests desires to commit an act of lust with one of them... ...the one chosen must submit with the resignation expected of them... ...and must not refuse to carry out any act... ...under threat of harsh punishment. But the satisfaction of any desire... ...must be carried out before the other guests. What's happening? - My eyes, I'm blind! - Greta, what happened to you? She's blind. Blind as well. - What happened? - An explosion... ...very strong, perhaps more than one. I don't know. - Victor, take care of the guests. - Yes, ma'am. Berta, take Greta to her room and put her to bed. - The telephones, let's see if they work. - Doctor, doctor. - Nevermind, leave it. - Mr. Warner, please. Take a look around the house, make sure no lamps are lit... ...and that there or no candles or anything like that, understand? - Very well, yes. - Lily, I want to talk to you. Vasily, go to the terrace... ...and see if you can spot anything unusual on the horizon. - Airplanes, smoke, flames, understand? - Alright. The phone lines are cut! This one too. What's going on? I don't know. It must be something very serious. How well stocked is the house? Is there food, water, electricity, gasoline, I don't know. Food? Yes, we have a lot, for a week and a half let's say. What are you doing here Marian? - Did you see something? - Nothing. What's Victor going to do with the dogs? Let's go, let's go. Who knows, I prefer not to think about it. Me too, but I can't help it. That won't help anything. Do you think I don't know that? It'd be best to go back. Let's go. Sleep, Greta. Berta, you're needed more downstairs. Relax Greta, calm down, don't despair... ...the doctor will exam you soon. This cellar is buried underground right next to the foundations... ...just as the Chinese do. In case of a bombing it also serves as a shelter. - Come this way. - Yes. Why are you doing that? Someone will have to transmit again. Don't waste batteries. And what are you doing? Thinking of my children. They've probably died. No, that's not true, you're wrong! When we get out of here... ...we'll find everything as it was before. I'm sure of it. - Everything alright? - Yes, everything alright. Now you'll have to let them decide. Yes, I'll try to explain the situation to them. I don't know how. Listen. There's been a nuclear explosion, probably several... ...above all one of enormous power... ...or that has exploded nearby. An atomic bomb? Here? And... could it be something else? I don't think so, and we have no idea... ...what damage it could have caused. Idiots, madmen! - What will become of us? - At ground zero... ...and for one or two kilometers around it... ...every living being perishes due to the heat. - They're disintegrated, understand? - How do you know? He knows. As is logical... ...the most important damage is caused by the explosion... ...which can generate temperatures of 1000 degrees centigrade... ...and winds of 200 kilometers per hour. There are also secondary problems... ...for example if someone looks directly at the explosion... ...they can be rendered blind. That's what happened to the girls. I don't know, it's likely. Our biggest problem now is that there's radiation... ...in the air, in the ground... ...in the water, in the dust, everywhere. - And what will we do? - We can leave... ...or we can stay in the cellar. - Would you explain yourself? - Later we can try to get to the city... ...or what remains of it. But if we leave, god knows what we might find. But if we don't know where the bomb exploded... ...we don't know which way to go. - Exactly. - And if we stay? Yes, it could be it'll go on for one or two months... ...but within two or three days the radiation will reach here. For the moment we'll have to take shelter in the cellar. Lily says there's a market in town... ...we'll go there to get food and supplies to live on. - In the cellar, two months? - Yes, a lovely view. In my opinion there's no other choice. Nothing can be done. This is my house, and I don't plan to leave. Alright, we'll stay. So the first thing we'll do in the morning... ...is go to town to look for food. I'll go in the jeep with Victor. The explosion? No, I'm blind from birth. - Have you come to help us? - If we can. The whole town was having a festival when it happened... ...now they're blind like me. - They're in the old monastery. - Good heavens. They must have been having a celebration when the bomb went off. - Where are they? - In the old monastery. - Come on. - Let's go look for food first. - Wait! - Let's go. Bring something to cut this with. What the hell are you doing? We only want food. Why did you shoot at us? He's blind. Now stop talking and get out of here! Alright, alright, put down the rifle, we don't want to hurt you. Relax, calm down, calm down. We've only come to look for some food, we'll leave afterwards. Listen, I'm a doctor, do you want some help? No, I only want for you to go... ...leave me alone, leave me, I only want you to go. - Son of a bitch. - Have you gone crazy? He could've killed one of us. Well I think that's it, let's go. It'd be best to go to the monastery. Out, out! Hold it Victor, hold it! Robertson! Edward, Edward please, stop it,stop it! Enough! - Why the hell? - Who knows. - He must have gone mad. - We can't do anything here anymore. Let's go. You're right, it's too late. Vasily, let's go. Fulton, where's Victor? Tell me, what happened to him? - He died. - Died? Yes. - Please Mr. Warner. - What? I want you to tell me the truth about Victor. What's the point? It doesn't matter. It does, it's important to me. They killed him, that's all. That's all? That's all... You have to eat Doctor. What happened with Victor was truly an accident? Yes. - The food is ready. - Alright. They don't seem to be worried about what happened. What happened doesn't affect them. On the other hand... ...they'll be aware of the radiation before we are... ...and they'll do the same thing we do, hide underground. They'll be our geiger counter. Desperate to survive. The same as us. - Doctor, Doctor! - What's wrong? Come quick! I didn't expect to see you again... ...but you've finally come back Berta. - That's over. - Yes. Berta, do you remember the first gift I gave you? The cat. - What did you name him? - Bruno. Hm, Bruno. I still have him at home... ...or I did. Forgive me Lily. - Which way did he go? - That way. Why are you hiding? An animal as big you playing hide and seek? Come on, let's go. Well at least let me put this on you. Come on, come on. You don't want to talk. You're right, I don't either. Poor Edward, what happened to you? A transistor radio. See, you press here and it plays. Well, that was before. Do you like it? Here, it's yours. Maybe one day there will be music again Hey you, finish playing the pig already. Son of a bitch! Leave him alone! Are you sure you want to come? Yes, I'm sure. Someone's going on a trip. - It's true, they're leaving. - And they're taking my car as well. What the hell are you doing? Have you gone crazy? We have more cars than we need. Let them try their luck. - Bring that rifle. - Yes. Search the whole house for more weapons... ...and put them in an armoire under lock and key, understand? I don't know where they plan to go with that car. Neither do I. What does it matter, they're just a couple of thieves. Be quiet, please. Hello. Hello. What's wrong? - We have a serious problem. - What do you mean? - Radiation. - Are you sure? Yes. I wanted to die once... ...and now I'm afraid. I want to live... I want to live. Amusing, isn't it? I suppose we all want to live. Don't worry... ...we'll stay alive. - They're waiting for us, let's go. - Not yet. The signs are clear enough... ...but I don't think the radiation level is too high, yet. In any case, the process has begun my friends. This morning the wind has changed... ...now it's blowing from the southeast... ...and the direction hasn't altered all day. I think we should go to the cellar... ...there's no reason to believe we'll find a more secure place. On the other hand, if someone wants to they can try it... ...perhaps we'll find some other place before the radiation is fatal. - I'll stay here. - Me, too. We have food. I'll stay. Very good, very good, we'll start moving. Get any personal items you need... ...and then we'll take the food to the cellar. But... Put out the candles, hurry! Let's find some flashlights! Move! Thank you. - Turn off the flashlight. - Where are the weapons? Messier. Messier, where are the weapons? - They're locked up. - Bring them right away. - Yes. - Hurry! - What should I do? - Leave, leave! Murderers, murderers, death to the murderers, death! - The people from town. - How did they get here? Murderers, murderers! What are you doing? Don't lose your head, calm down! Give me ammunition and I'll make sure to kill all those bastards. - Warner, come with me. - Let's close the windows... ...come on, hurry, hurry! Warner, come here. Clara, Tanya, come. Stand there and shine the flashlights. Messier! Let's take the food to the cellar right away. Messier, Messier. Clara, Tanya, take care of it. Warner, you and I will have to delay them at all costs... ...then when we have a chance we go down, understand? - You're wrong. - But... What's protecting you once you're there, a door? Before half an hour's past they'll be in the cellar, and then what? Very well, what do you suggest? - What I said before, kill them. - You've gone crazy. And what do you suggest, that we teach them braille? Maybe they just want their food back. Couldn't we make a deal with them? Is that a joke? My god... What was that? Careful! Bring that table, let's barricade the door. That chest, too. Go to the back. Come on, everyone into the cellar. Clara, Tanya, Luna, follow me, take the food into the cellar. Hurry, there's no time! - Let's go Clara. - You come with me. Come on, to the cellar, everyone to the cellar, quickly! Let's go. Edward, hurry, we have to go down to the cellar, come on Edward. Tanya! Where's Luna? Who are you? What soft skin you have You smell so good, our women don't perfume themselves like sluts And your eyes, how are they? Tired, huh? We only have two shotguns left. - That imbecile left his up there. - Yeah. - Lily, let's barricade the door. - Alright. Help me, help me please. Luna. It's Luna! Careful with her! Come on. Luna, Luna... ...what have they done to you? It's been hours, what the hell can they be doing? They might have left. Yes, and maybe Little Red Riding Hood ate the Wolf. Clara, wake up. The radio, the radio! Attention, attention please! We're calling on behalf of the committee for civil rehabilitation. Attention please... ...we're calling all the survivors in the north of the country... ...we're calling on behalf of the committee for civil rehabilitation. Attention please, the war is over. The survivors of the northern area... ...must follow these instructions for their safety. Attention, head to the main highways. Travel south in search of them. Only eat canned food. Only drink bottled water. Leave your radios tuned to this frequency... ...to receive new instructions. We have to try to get out of here. Out of here? How? - Through there? - And why not? They must have heard the radio just as we did... ...that's why they haven't attacked again. - Lily. - What? - Is there another exit? - Yes... ...behind the cellar is an old tunnel that leads to an abandoned storeroom... ...but I'm not sure if you can still reach it. - Where is it? - Back there. Where does that tunnel lead? To the back of the house, past the garden. Alright. Warner, Messier, watch the entrance. Clara, Berta. Come on Lily. Here it is. There it is. Call the others. Turn that off. They're back. Where could the others be? Keep looking, watch out for them... ...and shoot for the chest, we can't miss at this range. It's gasoline, they're going to burn us alive. Don't move! - We've found a way out. - Where? Let's get out of this hellhole. - Help me get him out of here. - Stop talking nonsense. I told you to help me get him out you son of a bitch! Animal! Move it, slut. Let's go. Here comes Warner. - We're going to be blown to bits. - And the others? It's late, we have to get out of here. Come on, what do you mean it's late? I'm prepared to shoot you if you don't come out. Let's go, let's go! Edward, please, we have to get out of here! You didn't even try to help them, you didn't even move... ...they were human beings and you left them there you animal! Poor thing. Come back, come back. Get moving. Let's get out of here, come on. Follow me. Don't delay. - You're a cad. - Shut up bitch! - Help! - Here she is, I got one! No, please, let me go. Help me. On the ground, on the ground. Open her mouth. One less slut. Here we are idiots, come here... ...a slut and the biggest faggot of all times! We're here right in front of you, you blind bastards. Why are you crying? It's all over. Tomorrow, once it stops raining... ...we'll look for a highway. Everything will turn out alright. Everything will turn out alright Clara. Why do we want to go back? I don't know. From now on... ...it could be the world changes for the better. But we'll die from radiation, won't we? Calm down Clara... ...everything will turn out alright, everything will turn out alright. People can be cured of radiation... ...they know how to do it and they know me. They'll need me now. I want to live... I want to live to tell you. I love you. Clara, to tell you over and over that I love you. I do. My god, look, the highway! Clara, get up, get up, we're saved, we're saved! Just a little more, come on. Clara, can't you hear? Look!
