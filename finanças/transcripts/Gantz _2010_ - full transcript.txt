I couldn't go into the bathroom, I was afraid I'd see my bleeding corpse in the tub. What's that? Kato's jacket I borrowed. I really want to see him. I want to say thank you and give this back. It's a planner. Maybe his address is in it. Probation? Probationer Kato Masaru He was in juvie? - Stop it. - But his address was on it. Huh? I remember hearing that he didn't go to high school. It shouldn't matter. Well, I remember he had problems at home. A drunk father. Kato probably... Kato is not like that. How do you know? He's such a kind person. I wish I had met him sooner...

About what? What do you think? Wow. It's a hero-based story but a girls style manga. Pretty awesome, huh? Just a normal boy like you is chosen to be a superhero... Like the old me. What? It reminded me. When I was a kid I stood up for the kids who got bullied. Really. Yeah. I reunited with one recently. But I bet he doesn't remember that I stood up for him. Guess a hero has to keep fighting bad guys. It's okay for the weak to run. I'll protect them. Oh. I'm returning this... Did you see my brother? I did but didn't say anything. I didn't know how to explain. Kato, what's going on in that room. Are we dead... ...or alive? When I got to that room, I thought I finally died. I wanted to die. But now, I want to live. It's because I met you. You saved me. - That's why... - I was in a juvenile hall. I killed my father. My father was a drunk and beat my brother every night. I wanted to save him. But I couldn't save anyone. I couldn't stay with my brother. That's why I can't leave him again. Sorry, I didn't mean to... I'll take you home.
