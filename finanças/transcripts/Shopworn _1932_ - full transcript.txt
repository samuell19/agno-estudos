MAN: Hello, boys. How are you? All right, Butch. Four hundred tons of dynamite. This'll be some shot. Biggest yet, ain't it? Yeah. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [BLOWING WHISTLE] All clear on the hill? All clear. Let her go. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [RUMBLING] Look, boys. There's a man down. Come on! Come on. Come on - we're off. Some fool's gone and got hurt now. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Now, I suppose I'll have to listen to Pop tonight telling if it wasn't for him, the explosion would have been a flop. I'm always hoping one of them will be. No, they won't be. They're engineers, not doctors.[LAUGHS] Well, there goes today's excitement. Didn't sound very loud up here. MAN: Come on. Come on. Boys get going. Go on. C'mon boys, bring a shovel. [MEN SHOUTING] MAN: Who is it? Who is it? Hey, Spick, go get Doc, quick! Okay. Who was it, do you know? Must have been Pop Lane. He was working up there. Yeah? You ought to wear more sensible shoes, Kitty. Most men don't say that. No? What do they say? Oh, they say, "You've very pretty legs, Kitty." Well, you have. And then they say, "You're growing into quite a woman, aren't you?" And they try and make a date. Do they have any luck? What? These bohunks? Hey, Doc! There's a guy hurt. All right. I'm coming. You ought to get away from here, Kitty. You'd get a long way in a big city. Yeah! Just as far as I'm willing to let a man take me. Well, what's wrong with that? Hey, Doc. This guy's dyin'! I'm coming. Another bohunk got a sore toe. I won't be long. Will you wait? Maybe. MAN: Come on, get off there.[PEOPLE CLAMORING] Who was hurt, Fred? Well... Who was it? It's your old man, Kitty. [PEOPLE CLAMORING] MAN: Split open. Let him out. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Ribs caved in. Punctured the lung. He's done for, I guess. Couple of you hunkies will have to carry him to the shack. That's the finish I guess. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] That's what you get fooling around with dynamite. I've nothing to leave you, Kitty. Except maybe a little advice. Don't talk like that, please Pop. You're going to find this a tough world, Kitty. Be tough yourself. Then they can't hurt you. Not if you learn to take 'em. Go to your Aunt Dot. Too many men around here... You're grown now... Don't forget... Go to my sister. MAN: Only one man killed in the biggest blast ever. Got away lucky at that. DOCTOR: Yes, cheap enough. MAN: Wasn't a bad guy, either, old man Lane. Got them plates washed, Dot? Oh, my! I wish we could teach dishes to wash themselves like children and kittens and things. Yeah! If I had it my way, we'd use nothin' but paper plates. More sanitary. Yes, but they'd melt in the water. You don't wash 'em... You throw'em away. Oh! Well, why don't we do that then? Too expensive. Where's Kitty? Oh, she's outside, waiting on some customer. Sure. Givin' some of them college boys a treat. Oh, Fred. Kit's a good girl. You can't tell me, that foxy niece of yours gets all them tips just for waitin'! If you ain't fryin' steaks, you get me on the pan. One chicken pie. Nothing in here, but the paper it came in. Don't get funny. It's in there all right. Oh, that's a double now. Oh, must be for one of your fellows. Your thought are just like your kitchen... ...dirty. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Excuse me. Thanks. Don't forget the coffee. BOY: Hey, Kit! What do we owe you? Not enough. BOY: Oh, yeah! [BOTH LAUGHING] How about a little service for me, baby? Ah, ah. That's the way little boys get hurt. [ALL LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] All in one? Yeah. On Toby. Good time Toby. The payoff guy. Say, Kit. What are you doing later? Is that a proposition? Sure. [BELL RINGS] [ALL LAUGHING] Can you read? That's a dollar and a quarter. Ten bits to you. Someday, somebody else will grab a check and you'll die of heart failure. Say, Kit, won't you go to a show with me tonight? For what? You can't do much with a crowd around. That's why I like crowds. Take away the chicken pie. But, Kit. There's a lot of things I want to tell you. Only one, Toby. The answer is no. Don't you know any three letter words? Nix. Why you! Hey, Toby. Come on, we've got places to go. Come on. Cut the romance. Come on, Romeo. BOY: You couldn't lure a woman out of burning building. Yeah, you guys couldn't get over so quick. Nice day, isn't it? [BELL RINGS] No. What's anatomy? The study of the human body.Hmm... All in one volume? You boyfriends aren't satisfied just to read about it. So I noticed. I can't blame them. Why not? Well, what you don't ask for, you don't get. That shapes up like a dig, a nasty filthy dig. You asked for it. Oh, you don't know what you're thinking about. Oh, yes I do. I've been watching you. And take it from me, those boys wouldn't bother you if you didn't... Go on. I'm used to taking it. No. Let's forget about it. No. Go ahead. You started something. Finish it! All right, I will. A man knows when a woman doesn't want to be bothered. Oh, I see. And I want to be? Yes. Then how come you never annoyed me? Well, I don't like to compete with the whole college. If I owned this joint, I'd bust you in the nose for that! Yes, if I were your brother, instead of a customer here, I'd spank you. I'd like to finish this chapter. Well, go ahead, finish it someplace else. Where they burn incense or something. All right, I will. I don't like this place anyhow. You may be hot, but the coffee's cold. Keep the change. Pinhead. Nitwit. Skunk! Hey, you forgot your hat. Hey, stupid. You forgot your hat. You talk as if you knew a lot about men. Oh, I do. Living in a construction camp, you learn early. I could cuss when I was six, and I could say no when I was fourteen. You must have had a pretty tough time. Oh no. I ain't kickin'. It was kind of an education. Not much to choose between a camp and a campus. Well, you know they, they talk a lot about you around here. Yeah, and I know what they're saying. But they're talking it out in talk. I was sure of that. You know, you're a really fine person. Oh! Oh! Well, that's the first time, a bad slice ever did me a favor. If we park anyplace else, they'll start a war to break us up. There's more privacy on Main Street. I tell you, Judge, something terrible has happened to David. I know it. Why? Because he didn't go to the doctor with you? If you had a son of your own you might understand my worry. Perhaps. Although taking care of your estate gives me worry enough. It's the first time David has ever disappointed me. I'm upset about him. He can't always be tied to your apron strings. And I have to be so careful with my heart acting the way it is. Last night it throbbed violently for hours at a time. Oh stop it, Helen. You know there's nothing the matter with you. Oh, all right. There's nothing the matter with me. Oh! My soul! Look! Well, here we are. Safe and sweet. A red letter day for Kitty Lane. Didn't have to walk an inch. David. Hello, Mother. This is Miss... Miss Lane. My mother and Judge Forbes. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? You had me worried to death, David. I had no idea where you were. I had to go to the doctor alone. I'm sorry, Mother. I forgot all about it. Well, I guess I better be going. Pleased to have met you all. Well, I sure had a swell time. I'll be seeing you. Goodbye. HELEN: David. Oh. Who is that girl? What difference does it make? Just a girl. That's no answer, David. Now, Mother, don't start fussing right in the middle of Main Street. You had your arm around her. That's been done before. What kind of a girl is she to permit. I'll tell you all about her, but not here in front of the whole wide world, now let's to home. David, I insist on knowing who that girl is. All right. I'll tell you. She sells hamburgers. A waitress? Yes, a waitress. Oh! Oh, oh, my heart. Some water, quickly please. Campbell, some water for Mother. No, never mind, David. I'm awfully sorry, Mother. I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. David, you mustn't do such things to me, when you know how sick I am. Of course, dear. I'm terribly sorry. I'll die if you get involved with a common person like that. You know I can't stand it. Just don't think about it anymore. David, promise me you'll never see her again. Don't you worry, Mother, everything will be all right. David. Suppose you know about that double parking buddy? Okay, that's different. All right, Judge? Where you going? Downtown. FRED: Well, don't be too long. Oh, Dot'll look after things till I get back. You know, out there she just seems to drive customers away. Aw, Fred! Some men like me. You do. Yeah, I do at that. Well, it's a wonder with that Mother Hubbard you're wearing. Why don't you doll up? Well, do you think I could look beautiful like? Sure. Why not. Touch up your hair and get a permanent. And take that tent off... And show your knees. They're not bad you know. Put 'em in silk and you'll get by anywhere. What do you think, Fred? She'd better mind her own business. You dress your way and let Dot alone. She's respectable. Respectable? And what do you think I am? Well, I ain't saying, but I got my ideas. Yah, well your ideas could stand some fresh air. Oh. They're six for a dollar, mister. Can we pick any of these things we'd like? Sure. They're all the same price. Some prefer the Empire State Limited. There's class to that. Then, others prefer "Over the Desert Sands." It's more romantic-like. Well, what do you say? Over the Desert Sands. Very good folks, step behind here. Just place your heads through here. There we are, that's fine. Now I'll have a look and see what it looks like. Well, how do you feel, romantic? I wish it was a real desert, Davey. With all those sheiks hanging around? No, with only one sheik hanging around. If he would. Say, you know, I don't think I look good on a camel. We should've taken the Empire State Limited. More class. Oh, well let's have that too. Glutton. What's the matter with you? You look like you wanted to cry? Well... Lots of girls want to cry when they have a good time. Just to be contrary. No. Just that they're thinking when it's gonna be all over. Why should it be all over, ever? Well, things can't go on... Things? Yeah, like this, like tonight. Like all the nights we've been together. Gee, I wish I knew all the swell words you do, Davey. I could tell you what I mean. Oh, I know what you mean Kitty and I feel the same way. All right, folks, now get together. Cuddle up. Don't cost no more. I'll never let you go, sweetheart... ...ever. Oh shucks. You went and moved and spoiled it. What's the matter with you? Let's try it again. It's okay by me. Now smile lady and show your dimples. That's it. Thank you. But I tell you he wants to marry the girl. I won't have it. I simply won't have it. This thing is going to kill me, William. I know it. Now stop it, Helen. Save your theatrics for David. You may need them. What are we going to do? In cases of this kind, one usually reaches for the checkbook. It won't be as simple as that. Well, it always has been. But suppose she refuses? Women of that sort are very ambitious. Then, there'll be plenty of time to think of something else. What else? There's nothing. William! We could have her committed to some institution or something, couldn't we? She's an immoral person, really. Is it your heart of your mind that's affected? It can be done. With your influence. Ah, stop thinking nonsense. We won't have to resort to anything so drastic. But I tell you, William. It's the only way. If you had a son you'd understand. Now, now, now. Don't get yourself all excited. Remember your heart. Oh. Perhaps of we got him out of the way. Uh, is your heart bad enough to consult a specialist in Vienna or Berlin, or some place like that? Shh. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Mother! [SOFT GROAN] How is she? What's happened? Your mother is a very sick woman, my boy. The doctor was here just a few minutes ago. What'd he say? She must leave for Europe immediately. There's a specialist in Vienna that... Well, is she well enough to travel? Oh, I suppose so. That is, if she had somebody to take care of her. Doctor Ames recommended a nurse that... No, no. We can't trust her with a nurse. Not in the condition she is in. You know how nurses are, hard as nails. Yes, that's right. But what are we to do? She really should have somebody that understands her. As a matter of fact, I thought of going myself, but I... I don't see how I can. I have a case coming up the Supreme Court next week. Well, I suppose we'll have to turn her over to a nurse and just hope for the best. I guess I'd better tell mother I'll go with her. That's mighty decent of you, David. She'll appreciate it. Go on and tell her now. Please don't worry, Mother. You'll get well. I'm going to Europe with you. Darling. [WHISTLING] Hello, Henry. Where's everybody? Hello, Davey. Well, Fred and Dot went to Morristown to a weddin'. Said they'd be back in the morning. If they don't it's just too bad. I was hired as a night man. Did Kitty go too? No, she's over at the house. She wasn't even invited. Neither was I. I tell you, Davey, you take my advice and... [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Davey! Hi, Kit. Come on in. Gee, I'm glad to see you. Are you really? Uh-huh. Well, what have you been doing? Uh. Nothing much. You've been holding out on me what's this? Now you keep away from there. A love letter. Eleemosynary, elective, ejaculate. Taking your "e's" I see. You're not the only one who has a right to an education. If there's anything that makes me mad, it's to have somebody using a word that I don't understand. Well, don't tell me I use that kind of language. No, you don't, but somebody else might. So, I decided to memorize the dictionary. Why, it'll take you a lifetime. Oh, no it won't. Come on sit down. I'll tell you about it. I've only been at it a week, and I know the a, b, c and d's by heart. And I'll know the "e'" by the end of the week. Ask me how to spell eleemosynary? All right, Mr. Bones, how do you spell eleemosynary? Uh... Hmm, now wait a minute, let me think. Oh! E-L-E-E-M-O-S-Y-N-A-R-Y. That right? I don't know. You don't? I'm not even sure what it means. Oh, pertaining to dependent on, charity or alms. Swell. Do you know what "exquisite" means? No. I'm not up to that yet. It means you. You're not only exquisite, but ebullient, ecstatic, effervescent. Enough. Embrace? Exactly. [LAUGHING] Hold me tight, Kit. I've got tough news for you. I'm going away. Mother's had a stroke. We've got to take her abroad to a specialist. If it weren't a matter of life and death, I'd let her go alone. But I don't see how I can get out of it. Why Davey, you mustn't even try. You're going too. Me? How? When you're studying the "m's" in that funny little dictionary... Look up the word marriage. What do you say, Kit? Oh. Oh, oh, Davey, give me a chance to get my breath. Have you told your mother? Well... She knows we're going to get married. But she doesn't think it will be so sudden. She doesn't like me. She is not marrying you. Well, you can't blame her. Maybe, if she got to know me better she wouldn't think I was so bad. But if she's that sick, we mustn't do anything that'll cause her a shock. How long will you be gone, Davey? Oh about six months, I suppose. Gee, that'll give you a great chance to finish your course at some foreign hospital, won't it? Yeah. But get this through your head. I'm not going anywhere without you. Oh, I'd wait, honey. All my life if I have to. It's sweet of you to think of mother. Maybe we could elope, and keep it a secret. Tell her when she was better. Gee, I haven't even asked you yet. I'm just taking it for granted you want to marry me. You do, don't you? My father's dead, Davey. He died a year ago. I don't even remember my mother and I, I never had any brothers or sisters. You're all of them now. You're all I've got that means anything I belong to you, Davey. Where is Miss... Miss Lane? Lane? There ain't no Miss Lane. The young lady who works here. Oh, you mean Kitty. Have you seen Mr. Livingston? Davey? The last time I saw Davey, he said he was going to have breakfast with Kitty. Do you think they might be still eating? You got me, mister. But if you just step this way, I'll show you right where she lives. Thank you. Thank you. What a terrible place. Hmm. Oh! Is David here? Why, yes. Won't you come in? David, get out of this place at once. Calm down, mother. No scenes please. The Limited leaves at three o'clock. I'll be there. But Kitty is coming too. We're going to be married. Married? Otherwise, I don't go abroad. You might as well make up your mind to that. You don't think I'm going to let you marry this cheap, common... I'm not cheap. I'm not common! Calling names isn't going to do any good, mother. You mean to tell me you're going to stand there and defend this girl. I can't let you say that. There's no use arguing anymore. I've made up my mind. Kit and I are going to be married. Just a minute, Helen. Here are two young people in love with each other. Nothing you can do or say will alter that. I know exactly how you feel. The whole thing's a shock to you. That's why you've been saying things you don't mean! Now, perhaps if you and Miss Lane get to know each other better, you'll learn to love her just as much as David does. After all, you've to be fair about this, Helen. I must have lost my head. Forgive me, dear. I know I said terrible things. I'm sorry. Please try to understand. It's only because I worry so much about David. Sure. I understand. Thanks, Mother. I knew everything was going to be all right. Better get started if you're all going to make that train. I got lots of things to do first. I've got to get a marriage license, and find a minister and get a ring. Why, there's no hurry now, David. Certainly there is. There are so many things to attend to yet. And this is most important, isn't it, David? You bet. Now you wait for me, Kit. I won't be long. Thanks, Mr. Forbes. I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for you. I'll be back in one hour. Oh, don't worry, Mrs. Livingston. You're never gonna be sorry about this if I have anything to do with it. I'll do everything I can to make Dave happy. And you too, if you'll only let me. You must forgive me for being a foolish mother. David is the only one I have left in the world. And I'm afraid, I'm selfish about him. I... I still have several things to arrange for you before you leave. Oh, yes, we must run along. The luggage must be got off. David never could look after bags. He won't have to look after mine. I'll be ready when he calls. Goodbye. [SIGHS] [HUMMING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] This is the young woman. Kitty Lane? Yes... You'll have to come with me. Oh, he's joking, ain't he Mr. Forbes? It's a complaint for violation of the Public Morals Act. Violation? How do you know? I swore out the complaint. Oh, Collins, I'd like a few minutes with this young lady. All right, Judge. Will you step inside, please. Where's Dave? David's at home. You mean something bad. What is it? I've convinced David that temporary unhappiness is better than permanent tragedy. You... You've talked him out of marrying me? Exactly. Why do you want to do this to us? We love each other. Oh, I'm sure you do now. We want to get married. Oh, if Davey were only here I know he'd help me. He can't help you. Nobody can. But yourself. Now, my dear young lady, it isn't necessary for you to do any acting. I know what it's all about. I've handled cased like this before. I want to see Davey. That's out of the question. David's leaving for New York with his mother. They're sailing for Europe immediately. However, they have authorized me to act for them. I see. All right, Mr. Forbes. Go ahead, do your stuff. Please, no heroics. I told Mrs. Livingston and David that it wouldn't be fair to expect you to go without compensation. I thought you'd prefer cash. Five thousand dollars. Merely for leaving town immediately. What are you trying to make of me? What you wish I was? Something cheap and common? Something that money can buy? Well, you can't. Nobody can. You, and the nice decent people who sent you here are the real cheap ones. Trying to put a price on something that there isn't any price on. If that's being decent, I'm glad I'm common. If that's being rich, I'm glad I'm cheap. And I'm going to stay cheap. Because no matter how cheap I am, I'm not for sale. Come on in copper and earn your pay! [WHISTLING] You understand thoroughly? Oh, hello Mr. Forbes. Still waiting for me? Yes, David. I'm sorry to be so late, but I had a hard time finding a minister. Where's Kitty? Why, she's... Where is Kitty? Where is she? She's gone. What? When? What is this? Now if you'll listen calmly, David, I'll tell you. Go ahead. Gone. For good. For her good and your good. I couldn't let her take advantage of you. What do you mean? What have you done to her? Now, don't get excited. Everything has been settled amicably. Kitty's perfectly satisfied and she got out of it with $5000. You lie. Chivalrous, but foolish. He's lying, isn't he? He's lying! Say he's lying! Well, she got the money and gone. That's all I know. Left a message for you, "Thanks for the buggy ride." You don't doubt my word, do you now, David? I can hardly believe it. When you get a chance to think it over, you'll realize how lucky you are to get out of it. And you'll thank me. Sure I will. I'll thank you right now. My hundred dollars. I'll send you a check. No, you don't. I want it now. I don't trust you. [SINGING] And in conclusion, Kitty Lane, it is the duty of this court to protect and help such as you. I therefore commit you to the State Home for the Regeneration of Females for a period of 90 days. I earnestly hope that while there you will learn the error of your ways. Next case. [SIGHS] Oh. Say, it'll take you a month to get those bumps off your knees. How long will it take 'em to stop hurting? Oh, just as soon as you get a pair of silk stockings on again. Yeah, I guess silk is healing. Yeah. Hey, Lane. Where do you think you are, in a boudoir? Sitting down, huh? Well, you're not here to sit down. Report to the laundry. That'll keep you awake. Take your bucket. Oh. Get back. Scrub your floor, that's all you got to do. Come on, Lane, quit bluffing. Much better today. Well, this is better than scrubbing floors, isn't it? Good clean stock you come from. You needed strength and had it. She'll be all right. Her kind pulls through anything. Much better today. Well, this is better than scrubbing floors, isn't it? Goodbye, Lane. Behave yourself. Right. My, but you're thin, but sweet-like. Well, you don't get fat on what they feed you in there. No hamburgers? I could even eat one of Fred's now. Well, now that you're out, what are you gonna do, Kit? Go back to waiting I guess, till I get on my feet. Oh. That is if Fred will have me. Well, I sort of suggested it to him the other night. It was awful mean, the things he said. Yeah, I guess a good man like Fred wouldn't want a girl like me around now. Oh, let me help you, you must be weak. No, I'm strong now. I've taken my sock and I'm up again. Well, I know a place where they're taking girls on. A canning factory. I just got out of one. Yes, but you got to do something. I will. Plenty. Here, Kit. Maybe that will give you a start. Thanks, Dot. Well, there's my car, I can't miss it. I gotta meet Fred. Goodbye. Bye. And, Kit, if you need anything, will you let me know? Sure, I will. Thanks. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, my. Every time I hear a knock, it reminds me of Fred. That one wasn't heavy enough. He's at the stage door and wants to see Miss Lane. Who is it? Oh, it's him. Who? Him. David. Oh. Show him in, please. Well, how does he know where to find you? Pretty much like finding Broadway, isn't it? Just turn to the right at the next corner. But, Kit, it's been six years. And you haven't seen him since. No, but I've thought enough about him. I knew someday I'd be square with him for everything. Oh, you ain't gonna hurt him, are you? No. Oh, no. No more than he hurt me. Thank you. Oh. Yes, it's me. I'd heard you left Fred. Well, he didn't need me anymore. He's using paper dishes now. You can go in. My favorite ghost walks again. How are you? Flesh and blood, I hope. If I weren't, you'd make me want to be. Oh, you've improved. You pay compliments now instead of insulting. Won't you sit down? Thank you. You're lovely, Kitty. Gorgeous. Oh, go on. I adore these evidences of your maturity. You're everything I've heard you were. And that covers a lot of territory. It's great to see you successful and famous. It makes me very happy. You haven't done so badly yourself. Successful young surgeon, Dr. Livingston. The post graduate work in Vienna didn't hurt. People are still impressed with the European label. Is your memory strong enough? Overwhelming. I remember we spoiled a plate before this masterpiece took. Really, how? You haven't forgotten? Apparently I have. What was it? A schoolgirl kiss or something as trivial? Oh, nothing, I suppose. It was a long time ago. Kitty, the curtain's going up. Oh! When am I going to see you? I rather hoped I could talk to you. I did too. Are you alone? Yes, I am. Mother's at the hotel. Oh, and how is your mother? Well, she still complains some... Kitty. I... I rather supposed the European trip would have cured her completely. I'm having some friends to supper. If you care to join us? Of course, where? Dot will tell you. Oh, no. No, you'd better meet me here after the show. I'll be here. Kit, hurry! Kit, hurry! Kit, hurry. Oh, yes. Well, Dave, here's where we live. It's nice than Fred's, ain't it? Has Mr. Dean arrived yet? A few moments ago, Madame, with Mr. Renoir. Thanks, Dot. Come along, Dave. [INDISTINCT TALK] Hello, how are you? I saw you tonight. Did you like him? [SPEAKING FRENCH] Anything in French is always flattery. Oh, no, no. Do I exaggerate? Wasn't her performance superb? In all these years, I never saw so much artistry. So much, um... What you call it in these country. Sex.Shh. In this country, we call sex anything else but. Mr. Livingston, Mr. Dean. Monsieur Renoir. Enchante. When are you coming to play this for me in Paris? Well, that depends on Mr. Dean. I'm afraid not for a long time, Andre. But I will not listen to such refusals. I wish to talk business. [GASPS] Let's get away from these business men. Andre, you make everyone at home for me. I'm going to gossip about old times with an old friend. But if you hid yourself, they never will forgive me. My dear, we saw you the other night and we haven't stopped raving yet.Thanks. Have a cocktail. We've stopped counting. How do you like my little cottage? Little? I'd get lost here. I imagine you're lonesome yourself sometimes, aren't you? Oh, no, I have plenty of company. Men flock around quite a bit. Well, I can't blame them for that. Although not as much as they might. Wives are apt to be narrow minded. Is that what you invited me up here for? To throw this into my face? It's the best I can do now. I'm sorry I can't show you some of the places I've lived. And some of the ways. I could kill you. No, you couldn't. You did that long ago. When I waited for you to come back before they sent me to the Reformatory for the crime of trusting you. Well, you can't blame that one on me. Judge Forbes told me why you were sent. I can imagine. He said it was a community affair, didn't he? Yes. And you believed him. Well, it doesn't matter. I was too unimportant, too ignorant. Well, I've learned. They've taught me the ABC's in that Reformatory. Aren't you proud of your job? But, Kitty... Now get out! Get out! Today's paper. Where are they tomorrow? Lighting fires. You're speaking of France. Over here we use steam heat. And why not France? You'll rest. The South, the Riviera! Then if you want, I give you a play. London. And I promise you, you'll be the toast of Europe. Oui? I can't promise you to stay on the front page forever. Oh, then you will go? No? I don't know much about anything just now. Only know I'm tired. But, I will see you soon. If not in Paris, here. You can't become a hermit. Perhaps. Goodbye, my friend. Au revoir. FORBES: Well, what are you going to do about it? There's something behind her coming here. I know it. Oh, don't be absurd, Helen. She's an actress. She visits hundreds of towns like this, besides it's been years. Dave's probably forgotten her. I'm never going to let that woman get a hold of him again. I'll do anything to stop her. Anything. Don't be violent, Helen. After all, Dave's got to marry sometime. Never. Not her. Helen. Have you ever thought of consulting a psycho-analyst? Ridiculous. Why? Oh, sometimes emotions, mother love for instance, turn inward, then they're dangerous. Am I abnormal because I want to protect my son? Good evening, Mother. Oh, good evening dear. Hello, Judge. Hello, David, how are you? Just fine thank you. FORBES: Well, I've got to be running along. Goodbye, David. Goodnight, Helen. HELEN: Goodnight, Judge. Think over what I said. How do you feel, dear? All right. I'm worried about you, David. You're working too hard. You must play more. Take up golf again. I don't have time to play. I'm too busy being successful. That's what you wanted. I hope you're happy. David. Where's the evening paper? Paper? Why, uh... Why, I don't know. I don't think it was left. It never seems to be here when I want it. Oh, please don't stop to read it now, David. Uh, you've so little time to dress. Dress? For what? The Thorns' dinner at the hotel. You haven't forgotten? I'm not going. Oh, David, you must. We promised. You promised. I didn't. The evening paper, please, Nora. Why, I gave it to you, Mrs. Livingston. Don't you remember, ma'am? And I showed you where Kitty Lane was coming here to visit. To me? Yes, ma'am. Oh, yes, yes, of course. I'd forgotten all about it. You may go, Nora. Where is it? David, you mustn't take up with that woman again. David, I'm talking to you. Promise me you won't. Will you please let me alone? You fixed this affair once and you made a good job of it. You have nothing to worry about. Now go on and get dressed. You'll be late for your dinner. Don't you want to go? No. I've had all your things laid out. Please dress, dear. DAVID: If they have Baked Alaska for dessert again I'll leave it on somebody. LOUISE: If you had your way I suppose you'd have apple pie. ROGER: Wonder if Kitty Lane remembers me? I knew her when she was waiting at the campus inn. MAY: Really? I wonder how it feels to be notorious? Seems like fun to me. PHILLIP: The Mayor ought to run her out of town. HELEN: You're absolutely right. I agree with you. WOMAN: How is your golf today, Mr. Dang? Just fair, according to my blood pressure. [LAUGHS] I think her coming back here is perfectly outrageous. I do too. I didn't know about it until today. Didn't you see this morning's paper? Pardon me, Mrs. Thorne, about the dessert, I thought a baked Alaskan... MRS. THORNE: I leave everything to you, Mr. Murray. You always do things so nicely. Thank you. Doc Phillips just told me that Dave did a very brilliant operation on Mrs. Wayne this morning. I love operations, tell me all about it. Only man in the state could have done it, Phillip said. Go on, Dave, all the horrible details, I adore them. Nothing brilliant about it. Just all in the days' work. I wish I weren't so disgustingly healthy. Mr. Murray. Is it true that Kitty Lane is stopping in this hotel? Oh, yes. She's here. She's in the dining room right now. Now? Where? Just over your right shoulder, at the single table. Was everything satisfactory? Perfectly so. You may bring my coffee. But, madam has scarcely touched anything. Can I suggest anything else? No, thank you. I've already had my calorie and a half. Very well. Coffee for the lady. Do you know who's here? Kitty Lane. FLORENCE: Where? Don't look now, but over back of me by the window is Kitty Lane. No! Really? [ALL TALKING] If the management did the right thing, they'd ask her to leave this hotel. She's not fit for decent society. What do you mean by decent society? Well, this... David. [LAUGHS] He's only joking. I'm not. I'm just trying to find out from May what constitutes decent society. Possibly she's heard. This is decent society. So I've always been told. But I found out there's more to being decent than just admitting you are. WOMAN: Why, Dave. WOMAN 2: Well, I never. David. [ALL TALKING] Kitty. Oh, I didn't expect you to come this time. [INDISTINCT TALKING] May I sit here, I'm so upset. Do, dear. Does he know her? Uh, yes. A long time ago. I think he feels sorry for her. David is so kind hearted. He always did let his sympathies run away with him. Hadn't you better be getting back to the sewing circle? But I wanted to talk to you, Kitty. Alone. Somewhere. We're rather under observation here. Couldn't we go up to your suite or go for a ride somewhere? Careful, Dave. I'm a notorious woman and you'll probably get yourself talked about. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Oh, leave it, please. Mr. Livingston will be right back. Yes, Ma'am. David never acted this way before. My dear, it's all right, don't worry. [KITTY LAUGHING] Still willing to risk your reputation? Well, a shred or two of it anyway. Don't say I didn't warn you. I... I hope you'll be interested in my collection of etchings or whatever it is they hang on the walls here. Get it you nut and stop acting. Hello, Dot. My goodness, you both look so happy. I knew something was going to happen. How do you like my parlor? Well, I've seen better parlors, but never a lovelier spider. Sit down, Mr. Fly. Why, I'd be delighted. Oh, Kitty Lane, what are you doing? That's what I always do with my victims, isn't it? And the walls are sound proof too. [WHISPERS] I've lost my voice. I never could yell loud anyhow. You both are crazy. [BOTH LAUGH] One, two, three... Seven gray hair. Why, Dave, you're positively middle-aged. Is that why you came home to check up on me? No, not exactly. Then why did you come, Kitty? Oh, I like cold climates. And the people around here are frigid enough. Stop kidding. Come on and tell me. Well, I was a little curious. Not much, just a little. And maybe a little homesick, too. And? And I wanted to see if you had nine children and if they looked like you. I'm a bachelor. And if you're waist line had grown any bigger, and... And if I'd grown up any or was still an immature fool. Oh, well. That depends on who you're a fool about. You see those six gray hairs on me? Uh-huh, seven. Seven. You know what they mean? Uh-huh, your barber doesn't know his job. No. I'm an adult now. I'm boss of my own affairs. Capable of knowing what I want and getting it. And I want you. Oh, I don't know, Dave. So much has happened. We're not the kids we were and our lives have run into very different channels. It would be so hard to join them again. Maybe impossible. Kitty, did you ever spend any money foolishly? Never any other way. Well, I've squandered six years of happiness and I'm not going to waste any more of it. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Oh, it has been a wonderful party, Mrs. Thorn. Can we drop you dear? No, thank you. My car's here. I must find David. I must. Thank you just the same. Goodnight. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight. Awfully glad you had a nice time. You might as well understand definitely, Kitty and I are going to be married. If you want to make a fuss about it, all right. It will do you no good. But think of the talk, the scandal. There won't be any scandal unless you make it. If necessary, I will. Fair enough. David. You must hear me through. I've heard it all a thousand times. I've never remarried after your father's death because I wanted to watch over you. To bring you up. Well, you did. I'm not going to see my life's work spoiled now. That was spoiled a long time ago. I won't let that shopworn woman fasten herself on you, I warn you. Mother, why can't you look at this thing reasonably? So that we can marry nicely from my own home? From my home. From mine. I believe you'd turn your own mother out for that creature. If necessary, yes. David, if you marry that woman, you are no longer my son. I never was your son. I'm just something you owned. You're a selfish woman willing to destroy anything you can't control. Now I warn you not to try to stop me again. I'm marrying Kitty and we're leaving tonight. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I want to see Miss Lane. Oh, well, she's... She's not in. She's got a headache. Oh dear, she's... Well... Tell her Mrs. Livingston is here. Well, that won't do her headache any good. That's all right, Dot, let her in. Go on with your packing. Guess I better hurry then. Next time, you know, Fred will be calling. I can hear them dishes rattling for me now. Where is David? He's not here, but he will be. I know pleading with you is useless. I wonder if pleading with you is useless. Can't you let us have our chance. We only want to make a try at happiness. You've had him since he was a baby. He's a man now. That's just it. A man and a doctor. The slightest scandal would kill his practice in a day. If you only loved him the way I do. The way you do? Yes, enough to make any sacrifice. Enough to... Enough to marry him. And kill all the decent things in his life. The decent things don't die. Sometimes they're not even born. I have a lot of things to do. Will you excuse me, please. Goodnight, Mrs. Livingston. I warn you. I'll never let you do this, never. Are you leaving or shall I ring for the house detective? That won't be necessary. Well, that's one way. Which of us were you going to kill. Either. Both. I don't know. Am I that rotten? I wasn't thinking of you, only David. If you'd ever see your own baby grow up, day by day, year by year. It's a queer selfish sort of love. But I'm beginning to understand it. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] DAVID: Kitty. Kitty. Come in. I couldn't wait for the elevator. I was so anxious to see you. You could have taken your time. Well, that's a nice way to welcome me back. It's no go, Dave. It won't work. Come on, come on. Look, I'm the only man living who could read a timetable. See, here's our train. It's 633, the one with the dagger. No, I mean it. Say, what's the matter with you? You don't suppose there's anything in this burg to hold me, do you? Like that sewing circle downstairs. "Dear Miss Lane, we'd love to have you dine with us this evening." Yeah. But you said you'd go away with me, you'd marry me. Sure I did. I wanted to show your mother that I could take her precious darling away from her and then fling you back in her face. Has my mother talked to you? Has she phoned you? Why should she? Well, something must have happened to make you change your mind so quickly. Like every other man. Filled with ego. I want to put in a long distance call please. You can't imagine a woman looking any further when there's a prize like yourself at hand. Oh, Kitty! For Mr. Andre Renoir. R-E-N-O-I-R. Yes. At the Hotel Metropolitan, New York. Hurry it, please. You remember Andre? The very charming Frenchman. If you insist on reminding me. He offers me everything. Big cities, important men, distinction, marriage if I want it. You're not much for marriage. And what do you offer me? A bickering little town. A man tied to his mother's apron strings. You must think I'm the biggest fool that ever was born. No, you couldn't be. I'm that fool. If you wanted to get even with me, Kitty, you certainly made a good job of it. I congratulate you. David. David, don't you see? She is sending you away because I begged her to. I've been such a selfish old woman. She's finer than anyone I've ever known. Go back to her, David. Oh, dear me. [CRYING] Stop crying. I've never heard you cry before. Oh. Hey! Will you let me get even now? That's the stuff. We'll take the bumps together from now on. You'll have to take them for both of us now, Davey. Always. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Oh, dear me. Hello. Oh, hello Andre. I can hear you so plain. Oh, no, I'm afraid not. Well, she's rehearsing. Well, she's rehearsing for her marriage.
