THE MARQUIS QUENTIN TASSEAU EARLY RETIREMENT - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Sorry, we're closing, sir. - It's not at 5:30? - It is 5:30. - I keep swearing I'll change it. - We open tomorrow at 9. I may be nervous, but I don't like holding such a large sum. A large sum? Yes, I see. Follow me. You're right, you're never safe from theft. Yes, you're right, you're never safe. I'm no fool. Deactivate the alarm. Yes. Enter the right code. Excuse me, I can't see the numbers very well. Thank you. Bulletproof glass! Our latest innovation. Damn, since when? We rarely inform thieves about security measures. The money... I'll keep it. The bank's behind on its bonuses. You're robbing me. It looks like it. I am a banker. Open this glass immediately! Only the police can release the system. They'll be here in 60 seconds. I knew it. Since this morning I had a bad feeling. It's my fault, why didn't I listen? 56 seconds, better move it. - I don't know why I don't... - What? Shoot me? You can't. 45 seconds, if I was you, I'd hurry. 40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35... 34... 33... 32... JO - BUSINESSMAN Jesus... Instead of robbing the bank, the bank robbed you. I swear I'll pay you back, Jo. What'd you call your idea? I think I said "brilliant." Right... Can you remind me? I asked to borrow EUR 100,000 to impress the banker. To open the doors. And they closed instead. Yeah. You know I have to set an example. It's a matter of reputation. No, don't do that, Jo, you'll regret it. You'll end up in the dump and I'll regret it? That's odd. I can multiply your EUR 100,000 by 1,000. Really? How? That guy in a jogging suit? No way. Don't trust appearances. I saw. He's the Marquis. Your lawyer says you're out in 2 weeks. - That's normal, right? - It's good news. - Think positive. - Putting it that way. FUTURE GREAT THIEF - The kid's OK? - Yeah. She thinks you're on a business trip to Cap d'Agde. Cap d'Agde? You could've found a classier place. Montpellier, Narbonne... Perpignan! - What's he in for? - Robbing a boxer's room. No kidding? The boxer's room is next to a big jeweler's showroom. We think he preferred to cop to a minor plea to keep them from digging deeper. You're 100% sure he's the Marquis? Think carefully, you're talking the king of explosives, the Marquis, the best holdup man of all time? I'm not talking bullshit, Quentin. The cops went nuts, questioning us all. Otherwise, any news of my mom? No, I haven't seen her in ages. In the visiting room with my wife, I saw a guy staring. They must've told him who I was. Well, that's a figure of speech. It all started 6 months ago. I was a salesman for an alarm company. Mr. Bertolo, I assure you that with my alarms even the Marquis, the Marquis, Mr. Bertolo, the king of thieves, couldn't break in your place. Thomas, sorry, you're on the phone... Can you come by my office after? I'll call you back, Mr. Bertolo. Think about the Marquis. OK, kisses... I mean, later. Thomas! Yes, Vincent! What's up? Thomas, I'm your boss, but I'm also your friend. So, Thomas, I'll tell you something and in the name of our friendship, I'll ask you not to answer. OK, in the name of our friendship, I won't. You're fired... How can I be fired? I've been here 16 years. You said you'd not answer. I was named best salesman three times. Sign, Thomas. - Dickhead. - What? I didn't hear. - I said where do I sign? - There. Unemployment came at a bad time. I was deep in debt with no way out. So I decided to get a loan. I'd installed an alarm at a boxing champ's. He was away in Vegas for 3 weeks for a fight. What's more, I'd kept all my former clients' keys. I'd noticed he always had lots of cash. I told myself it wasn't very serious. With a little luck, I'd return the cash before he returned. And then... I needed to talk fast. You're not in Las Vegas? You lost? I got 6 months. It was my first time in prison. I understood right off I'd attract attention. And that I'd need to instill respect. I wouldn't escape passion and that special eroticism found in confined spaces that don't mix the sexes. Then there were the... what were they? Marshmallows. The marshmallows were my chance of a lifetime. I had to take advantage. To get respect in prison, you've got to make the first move. You big jerk! I'm no coward! No pity! I'd scored points. A little guy like me who beats a guy like him... ...was no slouch. I warned you! Who are you? That's when I got the idea. Bad ideas always come like that. We always think they're good. I'm the Marquis. I'm the Marquis, but keep it to yourself. Otherwise... The Marquis? Is that all? Are you sure? I was surprised too at first, but I checked, there's no mistake, he's the man you need to cash in. The only problem's he only gets out in two weeks. Two weeks is too long. If he's really the Marquis, we'll get him out. But if you're wrong, you know what I'll do to you. I know. Sorry, I have to set an example. Jesus. Go, Momo! Pass it! You play like shit! - Hear the news? - What news? Zonzon's out of the hospital. He could be here any minute. Are you talking bullshit? You can't just walk out of a hospital like that. You warn. I don't mean warn, shit, that doesn't happen. Thanks to your buddies, he might not be able to bug you. Of course. - Come with me. - No! - Don't argue, come with me. - Don't touch me. I didn't see the Marquis that way. Me neither. - How'd you imagine him? - Taller, smaller... Older, younger, not like that. We fool ourselves. So? I think he's better. None too soon. - You gave him quite a dose. - Sorry, we didn't know. Of course not, you thought you'd have to knock out a horse? You're way too stupid. OK, scram. You OK? - Where are we? - Manila, the Philippines. Wake up. Don't fall asleep. One thing bothers me. Stop me if I'm wrong. You knew I had only 2 weeks left? I knew. - And you made me escape? - You could say it that way. So, while under your control, if I get nabbed again I'm good for another 3 years? In France, maybe. Here you can get 12 - 15 years. 15 years... And you couldn't wait 15 days for me to get out normally? By the front door. We couldn't. It's urgent. According to the police, prisoner Thomas Gardesse, who escaped from Fresnes prison is the Marquis... Mom! Dad's on TV! ...wanted for several years. This seems confirmed... ...by Commander Gilbert of Interpol. Listen. Such means aren't used to help a simple thief escape. We had suspicions about Gardesse, which proved true. He is the Marquis. We'll do all we can to find him. - Thank you. - Please, Commander! Now to culture, with the traveling exhibition of two suits of samurai armor found in the Philippines. Their voyage starts in Washington. You brought me to the Philippines to watch TV? What are we doing here? We're waiting. Have you ever been arrested? Yes. My nick in prison was Van Gogh. You like painting? Not much. I just tore a guy's ear off. We can be on familiar terms. I'm not so sure. OK. We're coming. Jo's waiting. It's time to prove you're the best. - Who's Jo? - It's Jo. What does Jo do for a living? He's careful. Yes... Yeah. Two secs, almost done. Yes, kill him, and I want him to suffer. So make him suffer and kill him. So, it's you? It's me. Yes, yes... It's you... It's me... - It's you? - It's me. - It's you? - It's me. I didn't see you like that. I can't say how, but not that. You, Quentin? Like you. I thought he'd be taller. I can't explain it. But now I see there's no reason he'd be taller. In any event, I'm really glad to meet you, Marquis. Marquis. Do you prefer Thomas? I know your real name's Thomas Gardesse. Of course we checked you out. We also know you have a wife and daughter. - OK if I call you Thomas? - Thomas is fine. Besides being my name. Here's Olga, the woman of my life. Hello. OLGA - NO OPINION Olga, here's Thomas, AKA the Marquis. Nice nickname too, classy. Yes, it's very classy. - The Baron wasn't bad either. - Yes, the Baron's good. - Or the Viscount. - Yes, Viscount is good. I prefer Baron to Viscount, you, dear? Yes, the Baron's good. - Then again. - Then again. Jo, maybe we should explain. You're right. Olga, it's better if this stays between us. As you wish. Alright, let's get down to business. Explain it to him, Quentin. In 3 days, an armored truck protected by several SWAT teams will leave the Manila Union Bank for the Manila airport. To clear their passage they'll control traffic lights to ensure the convoy doesn't stop before its destination. The armored truck will be loaded onto a cargo plane heading for Washington. I think you get my drift. - You want to steal the truck. - Precisely. One thing bothers me, Jo. A guy like you who can rent half a luxury hotel, why would he want to steal an armored truck? Because even a new armored truck would cost what, EUR 30 to 40,000? There's a little misunderstanding. We don't want the truck, but what's in it. - Alright. That's...? - Â¤200 million in used bills. A fortune on the way to the US Federal Reserve for burning. You want me in? A real funny guy. That's why we got you out of prison. Jo's been working on this job for months. Our problem's this. The latest safe from Fichet- Bauche. A steel and composite alloy. ALEX - EXPLOSIVES EXPERT AND MARQUIS FAN The system has 7 dials with 12 positions. Around 60 million possible combinations with a jamming system when opened. But you must know it. It's solid. Nice finish, too. Given the basement layout and the building's age, I don't see how to blow it without destroying the building. I ran all the resistance and volumetric numbers... Impossible. So? What do we do? What do we do? What do... ...we do? What do we do? You can't decide from photos? You need to scout before deciding? It's imperative. Yes, for... ...the volumetrics and resistance, all that, we have to... I can't decide like that without... ...scouting it. I told you Jo. It's logical. Yeah. Very well. I guarantee 20%, is that OK? 30%. OK. It's OK. I can feel you're concentrating. That's normal, for a job like that. Go in the room. There are clothes in the closet. I'll be right back. How are you, Olga? I can't take it anymore. Jo scares me. You're afraid because he's a Mafiosi, he tortures and kills people, don't worry, it's normal. That's why I'm worried. Be patient, dear. We'll go together, things will change. - Really? - See that guy there? That's no guy, it's a door. No, the guy who went in, Thomas, the Marquis. - Yes. He's a bit soft, no? - No, he's no softie. Right, he's no softie. - Some might find him indecisive. - Yes, that's it, indecisive. - But he's not totally. - Not totally. We see that. We don't see it, but he isn't. That guy's the key to our future. Our exit door. Why are you talking about the door? Hello? Hurry. I'll re- explain, dear. Concentrate. I advised Jo to bust him out for the job of the century. I'll make lots of cash. We'll split and he won't find us. But where will we go? Where you always dreamed. Where was it? - The West Indies, right? - Yes, the West Indies. Are you sure? - No, California. I remember. - Yes, California. Or Los Angeles. We'll stick with the California idea instead, no? Yes. Instead, no. - Hello? - It's me, dear. Where are you? Why did you escape? No, I didn't escape. I was broken out. I can't say where I am. But everything's fine, don't worry. Nothing's fine. I don't want to be married to a big criminal. Where are you? I have to run. - I love you. - But... So, where is he? CMDR. ANAÃS GILBERT - INTERPOL In Manila, the Philippines. - Where in Manila? - Can't say. He hung up too fast. Get me a ticket to Manila and call me at HQ. Send it to my office. - See you soon. - See you soon, Olga. You're not planning to take off, by chance? Me? No, why would I take off? I'm just getting some air. - With your leg on the railing? - Why not? No, I... I like getting air with my leg on the railing. You never do that? No, and I wouldn't like anything to happen to you. We're roomies for a reason. If there's a problem, I get blamed. Let's imagine, I don't know... ...what if I didn't want to do the job? What would Jo do? Well, he'd... Right... All the same... Then I'd suffer the same fate. Quentin... I have to tell you something, but don't take offense. Go ahead. I'm not the Marquis. I'd expect anything from you, except laughter. Yes, c'mon. No, violence maybe, but not... Bravo. Good reaction. 'Cause it's not good news. Think carefully. You're not the Marquis? No. Now you're upset. Who the hell are you? Thomas Gardesse, former alarm system salesman. Why were you mistaken for the Marquis? Because I said I was. How could you pass for the Marquis? - The marshmallows. - What marshmallows? Marshmallows made from beaten egg whites. Do you realize the shit you got us into? Wait, it's not my fault. I didn't ask to escape. Then, let's see how Jo reacts. I can hear the rip saw. You won't. You risk the same, you said. I'll say you're seeing his wife. You're crazy. Me an affair with Jo's wife? Yes, you told her you're in love. Wait... My... You're disappointed? - Yes, there's no point in lying. - Yes, I'm a bit disappointed. A bit bitter. It was my last shot before retiring. - Where? - Los Angeles. No, in California. - We're screwed. - No. Don't talk like that. Think positive. We're not screwed, don't worry. - We'll escape. - Yeah? Got a plan? It's simple. One, we open the door, two, we take the elevator, three, we leave. OK, go ahead. One! The door. I'll open it. Then out I go. Hi, guys! Just making sure you're there. Good evening. Two. We need a new plan. I may have an idea. I can't. I tell you, I can't. Jump, it's not even 3 meters. I'm stuck, get it? Vertigo. I'm not a killer like you. - I don't get the connection. - I connect what I want. - Olga! - That's good. Sorry. How do you say escaping? What do we do now? Lucky I caught you! You thought I was sleeping? Weren't we nice with you? You wanted to split. Because... Because you like to be a one- man show. Yes... You wanted to keep the job for yourself. Yes... To pocket the Â¤200 million like a glutton. Yes... There, he talked. A real chatterbox. You played the fool, Marquis. And you're lucky. I got big news earlier. I'm going to be a dad. That's sacred. I can't kill you today. But one more false move and you're dead. Excuse me, I hit a little hard. It had to look real. I found it real. Any more, it would've hurt. Anyway, we're as good as dead. - Quit griping, I can't think. - I'll gripe if I want. I won't see my wife and daughter, but you've no kids, - you can't understand. - Not yet. But soon. What are you talking about? Jo's child is yours? Yes. But for now, my child is Jo's. So, Jo thinks it's his? Yeah. - If Jo found out about...? - Olga and I? He'd... Yeah. Still it's better it's yours. You're much more handsome than Jo. It's true, you've got nice eyes... ...you're in good shape for a guy your age. Your hands are remarkable. You have very elegant, feminine hands. Cut it out! Just trying to pass the time while waiting to die. You have nice skin, too. You're wanted in the infirmary. I told you 100 times. It's for a job in the Philippines. I don't know more. THE MARQUIS - THE REAL ONE I already told you everything. The guy beat up Zonzon and told me he was the Marquis. CMDR. BANZON - SWAT LEADER Disguises are a must. Disguises are a must. European Union pilots pass unnoticed in Asia. Especially in an airport. What'll you start with? The Marquis wants to see all the spots the bills will pass. Right, all the spots. - Manila Airport. - Right. Union Bank. The route from downtown to the airport. Everything. Yes, everything. And who's he? That's Jesus. He speaks neither French nor English. - What does he speak? - Nothing. Customs is over there. Scanning. Cargo holding. Lost luggage. Luggage transits through that warehouse. The plane will land at the end of that runway. It'll be impossible to approach. The armored car will go directly into the cargo hold. Over there. You've seen all you wanted? No, he needs to see more. You two stay here. The Marquis and I will case the joint. Quentin, make a sign if he acts smart. We need to get 500 meters away from those guys. OK, got it. You could stand straighter, Quentin. Can you look friendly? It's important for a steward to look friendly. Wait, go ahead, smile. OK, forget it. A scowl's better. I think so. Let's go. See the elevator over there? We'll get on and when we get off we scram. I want you... It's the song's title. Commander Rompel, heading to Hong Kong. And you? Kirk. Captain Kirk. Just kidding. Commander Kirk. And he's Mr. Spock. No, he's my steward. What flight are you operating? Manila - Paris. Replacing... - Joussome? - Yes, exactly. - Joussome's replacement. - Yeah, but Joussome... He has digestive issues. He could never take this food. Pig's ears and creamed corn. Commander, we have to get going. Now, run. What are you doing? I'm running, at my own pace. What are you doing here? And you? Looks like you were taking off. Right, we're running so we're escaping? If you eat a carrot, you're a rabbit? A little basic, guys. We're working, guys. 42 seconds. Too long. We need another solution, on foot's impossible. We have to... We have to see the truck's route. What? - We should split. - It doesn't feel right here. Maybe that bus? Very discreet, two pilots in a bus like that. What else? You always hate my ideas! They're 10 meters behind us. We need a better opening. Timing their running on foot, I didn't get it. Yes, he told me, if we run, we're escaping. Just like if we eat a carrot, we're a rabbit. I don't dare tell him... Now, I don't know what they're doing. Go ahead, pretend to look, you're supposed to be a genius. What's he doing? Now? It's obvious, no? No... He's... He's calculating the perimeter. 3 steps one way and 8 the other? Isn't that a rectangle? Yes. A rectangle it is. It's the principle of the rectangle within the perimeter. And... And? And when... When you observe, you can be observed. So, you retreat to the rectangle within the perimeter, and you're in the clear. Understand? Yeah... Because if you didn't, I'll explain it again. - You understood? - Yeah. No. It's no good here. With the force of the blast it's too dangerous. No, we have to check the bank. Let's go, Jesus. That's the bank. The big score. Yeah, a really big score. You two stay here, the Marquis and I will visit. No, I'll go with the Marquis. You stay with Jesus. Thomas... Don't get cute without me. You're sure? I'm responsible. If you split, I'm dead. - I won't split. - We going? But... I'm not sure why we're here. Jo's scoped everything. If we attack the bank, we pass by the sewers. What's the volumetric? It's not that I don't trust Alex, but I always check myself. Yeah, I understand. Go have a seat. I'll handle it. A customer wants to make a large deposit. Where's your customer? I sent him to you. I thought he went up. - He took off. - What? He went upstairs and took off. He wouldn't do that. He's got too much class. Last night he liked the job. He's not the quitting type. No, don't screw around guys. If he split, I've nothing to do with it. Don't screw around, guys. Don't screw around. Guys... You were leaving without me? - Thanks. - For what? You could've split, you didn't. Even though you thought of it. I didn't think of it for a second. Yes, a bit. I told myself I couldn't leave you there. Even if you thought it, thanks. Could you stop that? I like it, it gives me a cool breeze. You realize you have to explain your plan to Jo in the morning? I could explain what I did in the bank. There, it's settled. Why was I worried? We go in the bank and you blow the safe. On that topic, what do you know about explosives? You're right. We're dead. Unless... Unless? I think I have a plan. Your plan is stupid! It'll never work. We're not doing the hold- up. The plan gets us alone, and we get away. Jo will smell a rat. Unless you're convincing. No problem, I've done OK since I got here, I'll do fine. You have to be sure of yourself when you present the plan. You have to believe it too. Go ahead, show me. Act tough. - What are you doing? - De Niro. Forget De Niro. A real tough doesn't grimace. Look at me. I'll threaten you without batting an eyelid. - Ready? - Yes, I'm ready. If you don't clear out of this room, I'll hack you to bits. That's impressive. Nothing moved. You scared me. You see? Your turn now. Scare me. Go ahead. Careful, I don't want to see any movement. If you don't clear out of this room, I'll hack you to bits. Try again. Now it feels like you're asking me to dance. Take your time. Yeah... I'm waiting for stillness. Whenever you're ready. If you don't clear out of this room, I'll hack you to bits. There, not bad! Yes, I could feel it. The first one was so- so, but now I was into it. You saw how nothing moved? Yeah, don't get puffed up, though. Dickhead. Fine, that's good. - Son of a whore. - I said that's fine. It's good. Asshole. When I say it's good, it's enough. Sack of shit. Stop insulting me or I'll bust your nose. I'm really into it. Now I can present the plan for real. - Dickhead. - I said shut up. - Jerk. - Shut up. - Sack of shit. - Shut up or I'll kill you. Jo's waiting for you. Pardon me? Jo's waiting for you. Jo's waiting for you, Mr. Marquis. OK? Repeat it. Jo's waiting for you, Mr. Marquis. See, that wasn't hard, buddy. OK, scram. We'll be right there. You too, teddybear. Can you move your ass? Cool it with me. Above all, don't forget the American pilot. I won't forget the American pilot. Every time you forget the American pilot. I didn't forget the American pilot. - Yes, you did. - No. I didn't. I forgot my glasses. Move, teddybear. Good. - We're listening, Marquis. - Here it is. Look at my dive, Jo. Can't you see I'm busy, dear? And it's not good for the baby. Lie down instead. - Go ahead. - Here it is. I'm gonna dive, want to watch? Later, dear. And put your hands in front. OK, Jo, couldn't you ask your wife to dive somewhere else? You're talking about my wife. I'm talking about a plan that could make us billionaires. So it's the billion or the diving. I'm gonna dive, want to watch? Olga, leave us, go upstairs. Do I leave you or go up? You leave us and go up. Here it is. Quentin and I take a van. We go to an empty warehouse. What's interesting is the next warehouse over. You drive. Drive the truck. That's the horn. We get there and discreetly enter the first warehouse. Then we dig a hole with shovels. We dig our hole, a tunnel, that'll lead us to the bank safe. We get out the blowtorches. We go through the wall. Once we're... I made a mistake, it's the other direction. If we go the other way, we're in the same warehouse. Naturally, the guys will get the van, not ours but theirs. Then we freeze, not a sound. Then the guys take the van to the airport. No one's seen anything, right? They quietly go to the airport, sign the little paper... They go there and go in. Then, and that's where the plan's fabulous... What's next door? The truck with the loot. We open the van door and set the explosives. Next...! It explodes. Meanwhile, in the US, there's an American pilot. He unsuspectingly drinks his coffee. He falls, because it's poisoned. He'll be replaced by another pilot, who's our accomplice. So we take the money from the truck, start the car and leave with the loot. There. So? What do you think? With anyone else but you I'd have thought this plan was... How can I say it? Can anybody help? - Utterly ludicrous? - Yes, that's it. An utterly ludicrous plan. But since it's from you, I can say it's... doable. Alex and Bruno, go to the warehouse with the Marquis to handle technical details. One last thing, Jo. You're sure you can neutralize the American pilot? Sometimes what people say isn't what they do. - If you can't, it's over. - Let's handle the details. No, because I won't budge on the American pilot. Nitro, C- 4, Semtex, percussion caps, electronic detonators, timers, cell phone detonator. What's this? A sandwich. - Very well. - It's chicken. I got it, teddybear. I bet you'll take that one, right, Thomas? - Really? - Really, one of your favorites. There's no point in me giving you advice, it only makes sense. Yeah, I'll take that one. Is that all? It'd blow up a mole's nest, but here... Alex, this is the Marquis. He knows it's not enough, right Marquis? - Yes, I know. - Sure. That's why you'll take that, that, and that too. Right, Marquis? Wait, it's fine, I know. I take my time... I nurture my idea... ...as I am the specialist, no? Yes, it's you. I'll take that, that... That too. And some of this. Are you sure? Yes, that might be a bit greedy. Listen, Quentin, I'm the specialist, and now let's get serious, OK? Alex, you agree that with that plastic explosive, one false move and we all blow up? - Yes, we all know that. - But let's be clear, the slightest false move and we end up plastered on the walls. With a bit of stomach here, some intestines there, and the rest to the right and left. Yes, it's so powerful there won't even be a warehouse left. I prefer to ask, as I'm not a specialist. But I won't take it. You're the specialist. Alex, prepare everything so the Marquis just has to place it. Yes, prepare everything, so the Marquis just has to place it. So I just have to place it. C'mon. I won't budge on the American pilot. I'll take that, that... Tense? Just routine. Alright, it's time. Marquis, can I have a second? Teddybear's not here? I don't like how he looked at my wife. Kill him. I gave him a malaise. Listen, Marquis, since the beginning something's bugged me. At one time, you and Tasseau will be alone with the loot. Maybe you don't trust me, but Tasseau's one of your crew. He'll always be with me. Yes, of course. But I took additional precautions. Don't be upset, your daughter's delighted. It's her first time on a plane. However, sorry we had to gag your wife. It's better for all of us. Such a chatterbox! But we didn't hurt her... yet. Understand? Alright, get moving! What's with you? A little problem. - What? - He's got my wife and daughter. He'll let them go when we're done. Done? - But we weren't doing it. - I've no choice. You know my plan's loony. We were to escape. That was before. He's got my wife and daughter. So we're doing the job. You're not cut out for this business. You're a salesman, not a gangster. So, forget this gig. Listen, I was happy to meet you. Yes, really. - But all good things must end. - So you're doing it? I've no choice, Quentin. I need to exchange the cash for my wife and child. So I'll do the job alone. - You're too stupid. - I may be stupid, but I love my family. Shove over. I'm going to have a family too. Thanks. You've thanked me 10 times. Without me you've no chance. - With me, neither. - You're good deep down. OK, one we break the wall, two we sneak in, three we steal the cash, four we clear out. OK. Thanks. It'll take us all night? Got something else to do? No, just asking. They're coming. Yes, breaking into the bank was impossible. However, breaking into a warehouse was easier. Unless... RARE SAMURAI ARMOR EXHIBIT LEAVES THE PHILIPPINES BY PLANE TOMORROW. Tasseau's plan was based on the Trojan Horse principle. For the Samurai Armor exhibition on the 2:15 flight to Washington. Leave the truck at the customs warehouse for unloading. Thanks. Yes? A man on the line claims the Marquis is in the airport lobby. He'll be wearing a black hat. Who is he? He won't say, but says he knows the Marquis. - Ask him to tell me more. - Could you tell me more? He says the Marquis stole 4 paintings in Moscow, not 3. No one knows that, not even the journalists. Put him through. He hung up. Get me out. I'm suffocating. Quentin? Quentin, I'm suffocating. It's really itchy. Quentin. Thanks. Quentin? Not helping me? - We don't remove our armor? - We'll be more at ease in it. - OK. - Thomas... - What was that phone call? - I don't know. Luck. My intuition tells me something's odd. - Stop stressing. - I'm not stressed. It's way too easy. You always see the glass half empty. - You know, Quentin... - We'll talk later. I'm busy. - You're sure of the charges? - Let me concentrate. I think they're good. Alex prepared them. That's no answer. If the charges are right they'll just make a hole. Alex said we wouldn't feel it. Why are you touching my arm? To talk about the blast, the charge. You're obsessed. Justifiably so. If Alex overdid it, the van explodes. I know, and so do we. As long as you know. Go ahead when you want. Bravo. We didn't feel a thing. Let me try. No, I'm the specialist. You're not a specialist of anything. - Wait, it'll work. - Let me try! Wait. Strange, I didn't push the button. You must've. It worked. - No... - Yes... - I know when I push or not. - You must've had a blank. When I'm stealing Â¤200 million, I don't blank. You've never stolen Â¤200 million. You went blank. I didn't go blank. Let's go. I've never seen so much dough. I've never seen so many suitcases. - What are you all doing here? - Coming to a wedding. - But, what did we do to you? - I'm chasing a burglar. Among us? - Nobody in sight. - You sure? - That's not normal. - See for your yourself. It's too easy. You're too pessimistic. We're just lucky. - I say it's too easy. - I say we're lucky. - I say it's too easy. - 'Cause you're too pessimistic. - Close the door. - Too pessimistic. Way too easy. Wait. Let me handle it. Who are you? I've never seen you. Get out! You're right, he was getting on my nerves. I was this close. I'd have liked to drive this. Go ahead, drive. No, but I'd have liked to. Shit! - Sure this is employee parking? - Yes. - What's the car? - A red car. We did it, Quentin. We did it! Your plan wasn't so crazy. I still feel it was a bit too easy. That's why you look glum? No, not for that. Quentin had hidden one detail. Jo had other plans after the job. - Wait. - You call that a little detail? I didn't want to stress you. Good thing. It'd have ruined the party. Damn! What about my wife and daughter? He can't risk letting them go. If you have a solution, I'm listening. - Unless... - What? Got an idea? - How do you know? - You said "unless." Right. But you'll still have to be the Marquis. And we have to get a phone no. for Interpol. - I've... - What? ...an idea. - Hello, it's Thomas. - Yes? Listen, I'll talk, but don't answer back. I know you're sleeping with a girl who works for the cops. You'll help me in the name of our friendship. - But... - Otherwise I'll call your wife. OK. Listen, I don't know how to say this... I've no idea... It's very important. I assure you. I... But I tell you, it's super important, damn it! Hello? Commander Gilbert, Quentin Tasseau. We met during the BNP holdup in BesanÃ§on in 2003, remember? I remember it well. I may have a nice surprise, but you have to act fast. I'm listening. Bravo. You're all over the TV and radio. - You speak Filipino? - It's a figure of speech. We said my wife and daughter. Not before I see the loot. Excellent. Good work, guys. You deserve your reputation, Marquis. What game are you playing? Take this off. - Want to blow us up? - Blow us up? What gives? About the 10 kg of explosives in the bag, if you shake it, there'll be intestines everywhere. - And bits to the right and left. - Right, Alex? You didn't do that? Damn, you didn't do that. Make them drop their guns and release the hostages. You're dead. You won't blow up your wife and daughter, Marquis. You'd never have let us go. You know what I'm capable of, Jo. Make it snappy. Let them go. Go sit down. This trigger can transmit 5 km. Pray that I don't need it. You've got some answering to do at home. Forgotten something, Quentin? Olga, this is no time for a declaration, but here it is. Sure, you're different, but I love you. I want to see the baby grow up. So come with us. What's that idiot saying? Olga, my dear, it's time you decided for yourself. - It's me or Jo. - It's Jo. No, not this time. I no longer love you. You scare me too much. And the baby's not yours. Anyway, I'm leaving, Jo. Boss, I've been with you for a few years, I think I'm done. I need a new start professionally, something else. - You see? - Yeah. Well, good luck, boss. Thanks for everything. Bye. I'm not sure I can defuse the bomb. I won't hide that it's risky. So I prefer to leave you in shit. Anyway, thanks, and all the best. Hello. You gave me 20%, right? Well, that's what you get. Look in the bag, you're clear. Also, I'm not the Marquis. - Surrender! - Bastards! 6 MONTHS LATER - CAYMAN ISLANDS Too easy. It was all too easy. Relax, Quentin. You've your wife. You're rich, you're retired. Enjoy it. I don't know. It doesn't worry you that all our money's in one place? Three parallel alarm systems, random patrols, a steel safe cast in one piece. You're right, I have to relax. That's shopping power. Buying the world's best safe. Right, it's useful. Especially with all those thieves. It's good to be rich. We were in the game too. So we'll leave you 60 seconds, then the police will show. Only 50 seconds left. 45... See that guy? Maybe he was the Marquis. - No, I don't see him like that. - How do you see him? Taller or smaller, but not like that. This glass was a good idea. - Where'd you get the idea? - I forget. - Just like that. - Anyway, it was a good idea.
