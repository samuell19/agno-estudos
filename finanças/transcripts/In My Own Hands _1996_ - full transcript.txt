- Gene?! - Filthy woman! You should be ashamed of yourself! You're disgusting! You deserve to die! NBI! Get the kids. The body was found by a man who lives nearby. That was around 1 a.m. The wounds are still fresh. No signs of decomposition yet. She incurred multiple stab wounds, concentrated on the thorax and abdominal area. Her face is disfigured so we can't identify her yet. It appears she was stabbed repeatedly until she died. Survey the area. Search for evidence or anything that can help. Are there traces of blood? None. She was already dead when she was dumped here. - Take the body to the lab for autopsy. - Yes, sir. You're in charge here, Dino. Just contact me for updates. Yes, sir. Let's go! That's enough! Careful! You two! Find more evidence. Sir, is this related to the two Cattleya Murders? This seems like a case of serial killings. Can't you can solve this? Sir, please comment. Are there any developments... It's classified information. We'll release an official statement after the investigation. Lara, please clear the area! There are so many people! - Sorry. Tons of work at the office. - Dino has been calling here for hours. - What did he say? - He received a report, but he wouldn't tell me about it. He said it's classified information. He'll fill you in at the party. Is this about the serial killer you're tracking down? Yes. He has a new victim. We found the body earlier. People are so violent these days. Here's your shirt. Hurry, we'll be late for the party. I went to a flower exhibit earlier. I showed them my floral arrangements. And? They said it should've been included in the exhibit. Is that a new dress? This one? You gave it to me on our anniversary last year. I gave it to you? Yes. I've already worn this about ten times. And I'm sporting a new hairdo, in case you didn't notice. It's nice. - Good evening, sir. - Happy anniversary. - Happy anniversary, sir. - Thank you. - Come in. - This is for you. - Too bad you missed half of the party. - The traffic's terrible. Joven? - Yes, sir? - I have a surprise for you, but do eat first. Sir! - Sir, I've been waiting for you. - Got any news? Let's go to the bar. Babes, just a moment. Hello? - Hey! How are you? - Long time, no see. You're right. How are you doing? Still working for your slave-driving husband. You know I'm the only forensics expert he trusts. Oh, there he is. Talking to his sparring partner. Her name is Nancy Sanchez. - Like the two other victims, she's married. - Cognac, please. But we have no leads on the suspect. What about the autopsy report? The same knife was used. And the flowers? We checked with all the florists in the area. This type of cattleya is quite common. We couldn't find any prints. He washed the body before getting rid of it. The killer is smart, sir. Friends... May I have your attention? I'm grateful to you all. Thank you for attending our 30th wedding anniversary. Thank you. If she had not been my inspiration, and if not for her patience... For the last 30 years, she wakes me up every morning, - That's true. - ...so I can get ready for work. Wow! But we're not just celebrating our wedding anniversary. We're also celebrating the promotion of Senior Agent Joven dela Rosa... to Supervising Agent of the NBI Special Task Force. Yes! What's your problem? - It's nothing. - You think I didn't notice? When my promotion was announced, you had no reaction. - Aren't you happy for me? - No. - What?! - I'm not thrilled about the promotion. You're the first person I expect to be happy for me. Why should I be happy? I know that this promotion means you'll have less time for me and our son! What are you talking about?! I always make time for you two. When I don't have work, I'm just here at home. When did you ever not have work? Are we arguing about this again? You should understand the demands of my job. I should understand, I should be happy, why should it always be me?! You know what you should do? Spend time with me and our son. - Benjie? - Ma'am? Benjie, what happened? What happened? No, that's enough. What happened? What? There are no monsters, okay? What happened here? - The light bulb went out. - You should always check on it! - It was working before we went to bed. - Stop making excuses! You know he's afraid of the dark. Camille, it's not Dang's fault. You know what's wrong? You treat him like a baby that's why he's becoming a coward. He's not a coward! He has a psychological problem. You see? You don't know what's happening here. Hush now. There are no monsters, Benjie. Come on girls, more energy! More! Cut, cut! Cut! Vanessa, look at yourself. I'm sure you know you're screwing up. To think you're in the middle! I can't afford repeating this thing over and over again! And the rest of you. - Smile! - Yes, director. You think people will buy that juice drink you're holding if you're as listless... and lifeless as that?! - Yes. I'm sorry, director. - Sorry?! What's your problem? - I don't feel comfortable in my costume. - You're not comfortable? Do you want to wear a long gown on the beach? I'm sorry. It's just... You can't have a thousand and one reasons, Vanessa! This is the seventh take! James! Rehearse with your dancers! Yes, sir. Let's go, girls. Do your best, I'm the one getting scolded here. Okay, game! Mommy, no! - Stop it! Mommy, please! No! - Don't touch my cattleyas! - I didn't mean to... - Look what you did, Didn't I tell you not to touch my cattleyas?! - How many times did I tell you?! - Mommy, please stop! - Stay there! And don't leave! - Mommy! ...don't touch my cattleyas! Daddy? You're having an affair! You're seeing another man?! I told you to consult a specialist. I met with three already. All of them said that it's just a migraine. Why don't you go back to America? That's just a waste of money. Here. You're all I need. See, when you take care of me, I feel better. I'll be frank with you, Gene. I've been very worried about you. You're alone in this house. Why don't you hire a regular househelp instead of calling a cleaning lady every now and then? You need someone to look after you, especially when you're sick. You're always too busy that's why you forget about your health. Why don't you settle down? Uncle, I can handle myself. Before he passed away, your father asked me to watch over you. I'm just concerned, you know. By the way, did you go to my vacation house recently? I noticed you go there a lot. Just be careful. The serial killer had a new victim. The corpse was found near the vacation house. She's the third victim. It's late. Aren't you going to bed? Are those the victims? Yeah. Poor women. Come on, you need a break. Let's go to bed. Okay, I'll be with you in a while. Even if you replace all the plants in your garden with new ones, it won't change the fact that you're lonely. Who told you I'm lonely? Well, you've been sighing this whole time. - Mister... - Yes? Get me another one of those. - This one? - Yes. I don't know, Sally. My husband is a good man. He's faithful and hard-working. And I have a son whom I love dearly. But as for you, Camille... what have you been doing for yourself? It's a good thing we found traces of blood under the victims' fingernails. The killer's an expert, he cleaned the body afterwards. All three samples have the same blood type. So that means our theory is correct. It's the work of a serial killer. Dino, have you checked our files for serial killers? Sir, the serial killers in our files are either dead... or behind bars. You said that all the victims were married? Yes, sir. The killer woos his victims... he even gives them flowers. Their meetings are clandestine because the women are married. Everything's carefully planned. He knows where and when to kill and dispose the body. He operates alone, and he has his own vehicle. He's a psycho. And he will kill again. - I don't know. I don't want any trouble. - Three women have died. The last victim was your friend. You could be next. I don't want Nancy's family to think ill of her. We'll keep this confidential. Don't you want justice for your friend's death? I didn't approve of her affair. Playing with fire is dangerous. Okay, do you recall any name that she mentioned? No. Did she describe the man? Handsome... Fair-skinned and well-off. They met in a disco. When was the last time you spoke with Nancy? The same day she died. She called and asked me to cover for her. It was just a day trip and the resort was only a two-hour drive. Resort? What resort? I don't remember. It had "valley" in it's name. The last call was made from Tagaytay. Thank you. What is this? You don't need this. - Where is he? - He left. He just asked me to clean up. He'll be gone for two days. - Two days? - Yes. - Did he tell you where he was going? - No. Sir, our contact from the tourism department called. There are seven resorts in Tagaytay with "valley" in its name. Why? This is a wrong move. He won't go to public resorts. You should be ashamed of yourself. You deserve to die. You're a filthy woman. You should be ashamed of yourself, you're disgusting. You deserve to die. - Why? - You're a filthy woman. You should be ashamed of yourself, you're disgusting. You deserve to die. You're a filthy woman, you should be ashamed of yourself. You're disgusting... Gene?! Why do you have a knife?! You're a filthy woman, you should be ashamed of yourself. You're disgusting! You deserve to die! You have nowhere to run! You can't escape! Now run! Run! Gene! I knew it! What have you done?! - Uncle. - What has gotten into you?! What has gotten into you?! Why did you do this?! I'm calling the police. Uncle, please... I don't want to go to jail. Have mercy on me. I can't help it, Uncle. There's a voice inside my head that commands me. She's a filthy woman just like Mommy. Uncle, she's filthy just like Mommy. Thoughts of the women I've killed haunt me at night. Uncle... There's a private resort right there. Over there. It's called Valley View. Turn left, then you'll see the signpost. On my signal. Now! I'll take care of this. Get cleaned up. Hurry, we're leaving. This is Valley View. There's someone there. Excuse me, sir! Sir, we're from the bureau. Can we check your trunk? Sir, we got the killer. He's not the killer. His blood type is different from the samples we got from the three victims. His fingerprints are different, too. - We're back to zero, sir. - No. We have a lead. What's his name? Rolando Galvez, sir. I did a background check on him. No wife, no kids. He has two siblings in Australia. The resort is in his name but he hardly goes there. The car is registered under his name too. - What about the other car? - It belongs to the victim. By the way, she's alive. She's in the hospital. Her spinal column was hit by a hard object. The doctor said she may never walk again. - Please go. Leave us alone. - We want to talk to her. We have some questions. She can't talk, she's in shock! Sir, it won't take long. Why are you so stubborn? Come back next time. It's really important. Fine, I just have one question. You can even answer it. Did your wife lose anything? The authorities believe that the case of the Cattleya Killings will soon be solved. According to Senior Agent Joven dela Rosa, the case became clearer... when they found the fourth victim alive this morning. The woman is safe but still unable to talk. She's currently under observation in the hospital. Here's Manny Pascual for more news. We're here at Makati Medical Center where Erlinda Sioson, the fourth victim of the serial killer called Cattleya, is confined. A certain Rolando Galvez was also killed while attempting to escape the agents. Galvez owns the resort house and he was the last person seen at the crime scene. Sir, do you have any leads? Sir, since the last victim is alive, will the case be finally solved? Yes, but the victim is still in shock. We can't get any information from her yet. But we have a lead. Galvez attempted to escape. He fired at us first so we exchanged shots. He was dead when we got to him. It's very interesting, it's on Discovery Channel. - It's true. - Joven... How's the case going? I read about it this morning. - He's quite the escape artist. - Poor women... What is the bureau doing about it? Everything we can. Benjie fell asleep, poor kid. He should've spent the night here. Drive carefully. - Bye, Ma. - Bye, dear. We'll go ahead. - See you next Sunday. - Okay. Bye! Excuse me, Have the preparatory kids been dismissed? I don't know. I just got here. Thank you. These are the preparatory kids... Where's your child? He's gone. He drowned last year. What? His cap drifted offshore, so he went after it. That's why he drowned. I always go back to the places we used to go to. I can't help myself. When I see his classmates, it's like he's here somehow. I'm sorry. It's okay. - By the way, I'm Gene Rivera. - Camille. - Hello? - You're too slow. You're a lousy agent. By the time you have grandchildren, I'd still be free. Damn you! Who are you? That's not my problem. It's your job to find out. Why? Are you giving up now? - What do you want? - I left a map in your car. Follow the directions. I got something for you. Excuse me. I'm Joven dela Rosa. - Is there a package for me? - Just a second. Here you go. - Let's open it. - Wait. We have to be careful. - Benjie, that's enough. Get some water. Hurry. - Yes ma'am. What's wrong? Daddy! I had a dream. It was so dark and there were a lot monsters! - Joven, please! You're scaring him! - I told you there are no monsters! - Don't yell at him! Stop it! - I already taught you how to fight your fears! - Why are you afraid of the dark?! - You're not listening to me! - Joven! - What?! - Stop it! - Now... - Are there monsters?! - Have pity on your son! Leave him alone! - You're traumatizing him! - I'm teaching him how to be brave! Benjie... It's okay... That's not how you deal with this problem! You treat it like a criminal case that can be solved right away! All you think about is your work! If you can't catch the killer, don't take it out on our son! What does my work have to do with this? All I'm saying is... that you should do your job in this house, discipline our son! I'm doing my best! But look at yourself! You're no longer the man I married. You've become as cold-blooded as those criminals you're after! Is that what you think of me? Yes, your job has taken over you. You've become blind and insensitive! Hi. Hi! Will the kids be dismissed early? No. But it's a waste of time if I go home so I decided to go straight here. Let's grab some snacks. I might miss Benjie. But thanks for asking. No time is a good time for you. It's not my fault that your timing is bad. When I catch that killer, I will crush him to pieces! Joven, it's my birthday. Can't we have a bit of fun? When will you ever stop thinking about work? That's right! Fine, fine. - Bottoms up! - Thank you! Cheers! Thank you! Here she is with her Prince Charming. Hi, happy birthday! What took you so long? We've been waiting for you. Traffic was bad. And we had to get you a gift. Gene picked that out. - Hi Gene! I'm glad you came. - Come here, Gene! Happy birthday! - Happy birthday. - Thank you! Everybody... This is Weng, my best friend who's also a commercial model. - Hi! - And this is Gene. The director she dates to be a part of his projects. Okay, have a seat. By the way, remember Gina? Yeah, okay. Dino, Joven, this is Gene. Dino... - Joven... - My colleagues. Cheers! How about you? Game! - I'll do it. - Okay. Then what? And that gun you used in the commercial? It's a Beretta, right? Model 84F. Caliber 380. You know your guns... I'm an expert on Berettas. It's a nice gun. I used to carry a 92F. I used it in several police operations. I remember this operation we had... In a barber shop. Turns out the back of the shop was a den of illegal drugs and firearms. They operated for four years. No one detected their activities... until I did, hence my promotion. Nice. You're a great agent. I wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. For me, you guys are modern-day heroes. Can you take me with you in your operations? I have a concept for a TV advertisement, but I couldn't come up with a script because I haven't done any research. As a rule, we can't. Besides, it's too dangerous. Come on, I can take care of myself. We're handling a complicated case right now. The guy we're after is a notorious criminal. Who is he? A goddamn serial killer. - What happened? - Nothing. What?! You're attracted to the guy and he's obviously attracted to you, - you've seen each other twice... - Only by accident. - It wasn't a planned meeting. - Fine. You see each other by accident. But nothing's happening?! What do you expect? I'm married. What can possibly happen between a man and a woman? Stop acting demure, Camille. I know something's missing in your life. - And this could be it! - Sally... What are you suggesting? That I cheat on my husband? - No way. - What do you mean? I've never seen your face light up like this. - Camille, go for it! Go for it! - Sally, stop bugging me. Okay? To think you were raised by nuns. And don't talk as if it's not a big deal. It's not that simple. Besides... - Come on. Go for it! - He might take me to places... But that's the exciting part about it! What if Joven finds out? You're such a killjoy, Camille! I mean, what's the big deal? He's just inviting you to a night out. He didn't ask you to go to a motel with him. He's probably waiting. Come on, fix yourself. And tomorrow morning, call me up. I want a blow-by-blow account. Let's go! Hurry, he's waiting. Oh my! - It's embarrassing. I kept screaming. - That's okay. Everyone was screaming anyway. - Target shooting, sir? - Let's try this! This will be fun. Come on! - I don't want to hold a gun. - Can I borrow this? - It's just an air gun. Come on, try it. - It's still a gun. Come on! Let's go! Do you have bad experiences with guns? I just hate violence. I always argue with my husband about it and... Check this out. Watch. Wow, you're good. - Your turn. - What? No thanks. Come on! No thanks, I'm fine. Game. - I don't know how to... - You can do it. Aim. Okay? Trigger finger... ...in. Review your sight. Use the front side for aiming. Relax your shoulders. Trigger finger out. Ready... Aim... Wow! I got it! You're home early. Where have you been? - Sally and I went out. - Okay. What's that? Sally gave it to me... For Benjie. Where is he? He's asleep. You don't seem to be enjoying yourself. I reserved the whole place for you. Because you told me you don't want to be seen in public. So... No, Gene... I appreciate your efforts, I really do. But... I really have to go. My son is waiting for me. Your son or your husband? We're here. Let's go. Come on, don't be scared. Let's go. Come in. Go ahead. You have a nice home. Thank you. I designed it myself. You have some strange paintings. But they're nice. I have this habit of collecting weird paintings. This is the first time I've entered a man's house since... Gene, I have to go. Relax. Let me pour you a drink. I don't usually entertain guests. I hate clutter. It's distracting especially when I'm thinking. This is the kind of home I prefer. Spacious and peaceful. Who lives here with you? No one. I have a cleaning lady who comes in twice a week. It must be sad living alone. Don't you have any family? I don't see any pictures. Homes usually have photographs of people... I don't want remembering things. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... It's fine. I just don't want to dwell on bad memories. Do you want to see some pictures? Yeah. Here. Is this Jonathan? Is this your son? There is no Jonathan. I don't have a son. That kid in the picture is me. I lied to you. Why? I was afraid... you wouldn't like me. When we first met, I was so attracted to you. You remind me so much of my mother. She was so beautiful. My father loved her so much. But... They were always fighting. Every day. Every night. She cheated on my father. She had an affair. She was a filthy woman. Daddy! Daddy! It keeps playing in my head. I can't... I can't forget about it. I can't get it out of my head. I can't erase it from my memory. I can't erase it... I love you, Camille. I love you. Don't leave me. Don't leave me, Camille. - I can't do this, Gene. - Why? What? I'm sorry, Gene. I love my husband. I have to go. - Camille... - Please, Gene. I have to go. Gene, I can't... I can't do it, Gene. Please. Gene? Gene, please. Gene... Stop it! What's wrong with you? I know you want this. Right?! No! Stop! Stop it, Gene! Gene! Sally... Camille. What happened? Where have you been? Why are you such a mess? Camille. Camille! What happened to you? Why? Don't be scared, I got you. Don't be afraid, I got you! Tell me what happened! What?! I'm asking you, what happened?! A while ago... in Fairview... Near Gotesco, a man grabbed me. Did you recognize him? No. Why? Why didn't you recognize him?! What does he look like?! How will we catch him?! Don't yell at me! Can't you see I'm hurting? Ma'am, someone sent this package for you, he said it was important. He was in a hurry to leave. Hello? Is this Camille? Hi! Did you get my present? Damn you, Gene! Leave my mother out of this. Let me warn you, if I get angry, you might not get your ring back. I'll tell this to my husband! Alright, alright. Let's see who gets to tell him first. I'll show the video to your husband. I might as well show it to reporters too. Give me the tape and my ring, Gene! Hello? Hello? Sir! Sir! What is it? Someone sent this. He says it might be substantial for the case. I haven't listened to it yet. Do you want me to? No, I'll do it. You're wife's really good in bed! She's really something! You're an idiot for not knowing that she's cheating on you. Does she not enjoy doing it with you? Poor guy! I thought she's with you? Nothing... I just wanted to ask her something... Sally... Thanks. Eat well. Daddy, what's taking Mommy so long? She'll be home soon. Go ahead, finish your food. Okay. - Dang. - Sir? - Get Benjie's vitamins. - Yes, sir. And you... Sleep early tonight. Okay. Okay? So you won't feel dizzy tomorrow. Hi! Hi. Mommy! Mommy, what took you so long? Traffic was terrible. Finish your food so you can go to bed. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. I was at Sally's. I just borrowed something from her. Finish your food. Why aren't you eating vegetables? It's good for you. Do you have a problem at home? Okay, I see you don't want to talk. But please, get some rest. I'm not used to seeing you like this. It's Camille. Why do... What? Why do women cheat? - How would I know if... - Are you sure about that? That's why I don't want to get married. It's hard to keep up with the demands. Then all of a sudden... your wife's already cheating on you. If that happens to you, if you find out that you're wife's cheating on you... What would you do? What would you do? I'd kill her. Dang, I'll take care of this. Go check on Benjie. Yes, ma'am. Boo! Wait a second. Take a look at my companion. I have a surprise for you. Your husband got drunk. He couldn't drive anymore. So I drove. Why are you with Joven? We're friends. Don't you want that? Joven and I are friends. I wonder what would happen if he finds out. Exciting, right? Right? Please leave, Gene. Is that how you entertain your guests? Especially a family friend? - Damn you, Gene. Get out of our house. - I'll leave when I want to. And I'll do what I want to do. Are you testing my patience? Don't forget that you're at my mercy. I can ruin your life. I can destroy your family. You know what else I can do? No! Please don't! Have mercy on us, Gene. Gene, please don't. Ma'am? Ma'am? I told you not to leave Benjie alone! - Ma'am, I heard something. - Don't leave him by himself! - It sounds like... - Go! Yes, ma'am. You had too much to drink last night. Who was the guy who drove you home last night? Do you have to know all my friends? It's just that I've never seen him before. Is he a suspicious-looking character? Does his face match the description of the suspect? Do you have any evidence against him? I don't understand you. I'm the investigator in this house. What are you talking about? - I was just asking a question. - Now, it's my turn to ask... Who were you with the other day? You didn't go to Sally's. I spoke to her. I had to take care of something. What? What? Tell me. Tell me the truth, Camille. Did you really go to Fairview? Were you really raped? Don't interrogate me like I'm one of your suspects! - Answer my question! - Joven, please! I trusted you. I trusted you! I believed you! I thought I was at fault for what happened to you. - But now I know that you're cheating on me! - Joven, listen to me! You're making a fool out of me! You're allegations aren't true! Then what's the truth?! I love you! Bullshit! I want to know... the truth! - I'm not lying! - Tell me... Tell me! - Are you having an affair! - No! Joven... Sir. A guy named Gene Rivera sent this package. What? Damn it! Dino. Yeah. Get Gene's address from Anne. Okay? Meet me at the hospital. Gene, give me my ring and the videotape. Say please. Please. Tell me you're scared. I'm scared. Your ring is in my room. Let's go. I promise what happened before won't happen again. I promise. Your ring is in the drawers. Go get it. You can't escape! Tell your husband and son to come here! It's payback time! Call him! Call him. - Hey! What are you doing here? - Sir, this won't take long. Sir... - Mrs. Sioson... - What will you do to my wife?! I need to talk to you. Do you know this man? Do you know this man? Do you know him? Gene is the killer! Dang! Hurry up! We need to leave! We can't stay here! - Grab everything you can! - Mommy! There's a monster! Where are you?! Mommy! Since when has our phone been broken?! Get my cellphone! I need to call Joven! - Mommy! There's a monster! - What?! - What? Not this time, son. - He's so big! - Not this time! - Mommy, he's carrying something! Dang! I told you to leave my son! We need to go now! Dang! Where are you! Where are you, Dang?! - Stop it! There are no monsters! - There is! I saw him! How many times do I have to tell you... Hurry! Come on! - Sir, let's call for backup. - No! This is my fight. Gene! - Gene, have mercy! - You crybabies! - Have mercy! - Stay there! Gene. Don't drag my son into this. - This is between you and me. - He's a part of it. Gene... We're going to play a game. Hide-and-seek! - You know that game, right? - Mommy... No... Benjie, I'm it! This is what we'll do. After I count to ten... You should have hidden by then. Gene! It's easy, right? Go. Run! Go ahead. Run! I don't want you hiding together. Benjie, you must split up! So that it'll be exciting. Am I right? Right? - Benjie, go! - Right?! Go now, son! Stop crying! All you do is cry! - Now go, run! - Go, Benjie! Run, Benjie! I don't know what you want from us... One... Two... I don't know what my husband did to you... - Three, four... - I'm begging you, Gene. Five... Six... - Have mercy... - Mercy? I'm going to kill your son... because I don't want him to grow up with a mother like you! - Gene... - I'm full of mercy, Camille. But did anyone have mercy on me? Did your husband show mercy when he killed the only person who took care of me? And you? Did you feel sorry for me? You didn't! You just had an itch to scratch. Do you understand me? Of course not. Because no one really understands me. They just call me a crazy and demented killer! I gave Joven a reason... A good reason! For him to finally understand why I kill people! Tonight... He's going to kill someone. He will kill you, Camille. Because you cheated on him! Because you're a filthy woman like my mother! Seven! Gene... Eight! Nine! Gene... Ten! Game. Benjie... Here I come! Benjie! Benjie... Mommy? My son! Mommy... Mommy... Don't be scared. Be quiet. Gotcha! Where do you think you're going?! You can't escape! Run! Hurry! Stay here. Stay here, Benjie. I don't want to, Mommy. It's dark in here. I'm scared. - Please, Benjie. Listen to Mommy. - Mommy, no... There's no monster in here, he's outside. You need to hide. You need to hide so he won't hurt you. Okay. No matter what happens, I'll come back for you. I promise. Don't go anywhere, okay? Don't... Where's the boy?! Where is he?! Dino... Dino. Go ahead! Joven! Benjie! Benjie! - Mommy! - You choose. Your wife? Or your son? - Damn you! - Don't hurt my son! Your wife is a whore! She cheated on you! - It's not true! - It is! She's a dirty woman! She's cheating on you that's why you have to kill her! Kill her or else I'll kill your son! Mommy... She deserves to die because she's a filthy woman! What's wrong with you, Joven?! Don't you have the balls?! She's a filthy woman... She's disgusting! She deserves to die! Go ahead! What are you waiting for?! Kill her! Go! - Mommy! - Benjie! Joven! Come on. Let's eat. Daddy? Is the monster coming back? Never. Daddy has defeated him. You have no reason to be afraid. Not while I'm around. Daddy? Please don't fight with Mommy again. The monster comes out every time you fight. It won't happen again. I promise. Aren't you going to eat? Maybe later. Inday, look after Benjie. What did the doctor say? He's coping but he needs a vacation so he can forget about what happened. Let's go out of town during the break. Okay? I'll take a vacation leave. I think you lost this. Mommy!
