"VARDAR-FILM" Skopje presents FROSINA Loba! Loba! Loba, stop! Loba! Uncle Krste, swim along the shore, I'll catch up. - All right, come on, come on. Where were you, lady? - Yes, at Aunt Tsana's. Something you've been running from me lately. I? Why should I run away from you? I'm going fishing with Uncle Krste. Otherwise I would have taken you. Take me there so I'm not alone. - Good. So tomorrow night? Go. Was it Evtima's daughter? - Yes, it's her. It would be nice for you to get married. She will bring happiness to the house. You're in the same place as my mother says. Share the skin of an unkilled bear. Hello! Where are you going? - Night fishing. Show permission. - We're here every night. We have everything we need. Give it to me. - Here you are. Everything is fine. You are free. Keep going! Quiet! A man? Hey! People! Faster! Come on, Klime, hurry up. Have you checked the permission of those from the boat? - Yes! Just now! Help us, they are still here. Just hurry! - Get over to us quickly! Quietly. And now? Comrades, can I visit one of you for a while? But what kind of people are you? Smugglers? - No. We are not bad people. Only I will stay, and the comrade will return at night. - Okay, I'll stay too. You will come to me. My home is right here. Partisans. You know. - Good. - Good health. Good evening mother. - I'm bringing guests to you, mother. Welcome to my house son. Sorry for not being invited. - Nothing, please sit down. Excuse me for a moment. Klime, child, let's get firewood for supper, eh? Who is it, son? - Krste and I saved them. They shot. Just don't talk about them. - Oh, poor children! Comrade! I'll ask you for a favour. Okay, friend... - Gotse. - Gotse. You will go and take this letter to the boat. - Good. Give it to a friend and show him the good way. You know. Location unknown, right? - Son, how is it in such bad weather? You don't worry! How much... ah! Blood, right? - I was hurt. Are you afraid, mother? Son! My hope, my life! If only they wouldn't separate me from him! Do you have any other children? Were. And now... one with the mother. And husband? Life without daylight... I was married to a man whom I had never seen. Sixteen years older. Jan was his name. Oh mother, this is not the one I was expecting. - Whom, honey, whom were you not expecting? I don't know, mother, I don't know who it was supposed to be. But this one is not. Mother! Is the life of the wife of a sad man very hard? Mother, is the life of a wife of sadness hard? Mother! Live upstairs! Your father calls you to sing! Everyone is looking for you. Fast! Why are you so sour? Like swallowing half a kilo of lemons? Hurry up! Going! Daughter, sing, amused us a bit. Get started. It hasn't even been a month. Jan went to a foreign land. The song hurt my soul. A young soul that I had to give to Jan. But it has remained torn. The pain was not due to the fact that my husband leaves very early, who I won't see for months, years. Or maybe never. No. Because of another. Why do the lyrics of this song bother me? Why can't I, like my girlfriends, cry for my husband? And so my life as a wife of sadness began. Such was life. I became a mother. Jan left every winter and returned again in the spring. From every trip to a foreign land, another child was waiting for him with me. And then... one by one they died with me. I buried Vasilche on Spirit Day. A week after Peter's day and a girl. And when Dimche died, Jan was also here. During the last departure of my husband, my last child also died. Wars have begun. The roads were closed. There was no money anywhere. I worked as a day labourer, weakened. At thirty-five, I became an old woman. Alone, without a man's hand in the house. Once, when I was sitting in front of the hearth, someone knocked the door. Good afternoon, Frosina. Welcome, Jan. I didn't expect to see you. For the first time I was glad to see him. He will replace me, he will protect me, for the mayfly has sucked me out. You came? - I came. I don't! Beautiful? Highly. Very beautiful. - I barely found where to buy it. Stores are empty, war. Then, where they were, there were none. And I said to myself: "Until I find something for Frosina, I will not go home." Are the guests welcome, Frosina! - To the yard! To the court guests, to the court! Well, where are you! All my throat strained while I call you! Do not do it this way. I'm tired of the silence, you know what. Oh oh. But just because you're not alone? It seems to me? Enough of this container-bars. Give your mouth a little break. Well, Frosina, with the arrival of the owner of you. - Thank you. As soon as my witcher returned from the war, he only knows to give me orders. I just donâ€™t know where I learned: in the Serbian or Bulgarian army. - Come on in. Frosina, your eyes are shining. Where have you been, lucky one. Welcome. - Glad to meet you. But no departures. - Now I'm thinking of staying with a girl... Like this! But how? So you've decided? - I decided. I don't bother from here. I will look for work wherever it is. It will probably be better now. Will be, will be. - I so want to live here. But it didn't work out the way Jan thought. How I wanted. He did not find a job. I'll get back on my feet and try to get back soon. And you take care of what you wear who will be born to you, ask the doctors and write to me. Whatever they tell you, do it. Don't feel sorry for the money, I'll sell everything from myself, I'll send you the money. If I die, if you die too, but let him live. He left, and by Christmas I was in labour. Frosina! News from your husband. Come on, let him live. Let it be alive. Boy or girl? - Boy. Then I'm on time. If Jan knew, he would go crazy with joy. Good health, Jan. Are you carrying a letter? - Letter and money. It seems to me that now more money is needed than a letter, right? And the letter is a good thing, but the money is still not for throwaway. And I forgot. On the. This is from me. And now I'm going to the village. Sunday. I'm playing a wedding. I marry my son. I'll be back next Friday. Until then, prepare a letter, and I'll come in. - Good. Friend, what's your name? - Kuzman. Friend Kuzman, you will stay here tonight. Third night, you know? You will be our guest instead of Jan. Is that right, Frosina? - Well well. When I opened the letter, my heart rejoiced. And when I read it, the house seemed to collapse on me. Oh, poor Jan. And which of these two? Take it. You'll see better. Hostess Frosina. Accept greetings from me, the owner of Jan, to you, Frosina. I am healthy and alive, and I wish you health and life. Frosina, don't worry. I have earned and am sending you and my friend Kuzman a thousand dinars and will send again as soon as I get it working again. Now there is no work for the masters, and I now work as a porter. Frosina, take care of the child, and listen to the doctors and beware. Write to me, boy or girl. We need a lot of money for the baby, so and with God's help from Easter I will go with my friend Kuzman to America. A lot of people go there and there was a lot of work, and I'll go. Now I paid for the passports, and in two or three months I will come, and we will see each other, and I will see the child. I have nothing more to write to you now and waiting for your prompt reply. Goodbye. I send greetings and kisses to you, and the child, if born, and if not, when will he be born. I don't. There is no my Klime yet. Don't be afraid, Mother Frosina. You still see him as a child. And this is a man! And what a man! True, mother, have you suffered much with him? Who? I? How would I deal with it myself? This is him, he suffered from me from an early age. And you know, he was very in love with books. I, poor thing, sent him to school. And after? - Once, on a wonderful day... What's the matter, child? Why did you come from school now? - They kicked me out. What? - I was summoned by Mr. Jovan to answer. Let Klime come out! And he told me to take a book and read. One of my comrades gave it to me, but it was not mine. Then I forgot myself and said to him in our language: Where is mine? And he, Mr. Jovan, as if I hit him on the head. Bastard! Something got on him. The offspring is insignificant. He is you. Oh, it's not true, son. Oh son? What now? - Nothing. I'll get somewhere. At least I'll bring something home. And so from the father there is no news in recent months. Quietly, baby. Hey, loafer, I hired you not to stare at my daughter, but to work! Scarves! - To the owner! Let's see the dresses! Right now. Are you Kuzman? I. I, baby. Where do you know me from? I have not been in our vilayet for years. I saw you in a photo with dad! I am his son. Are you... Klime, Jan's son? - Yes, Uncle Kuzman. Do you carry how alive and well from your father? Yes... I do. How can I tell you... Listen, child. I am returning from America. And stay in the village. And your father... Look, you're not a child any more. I'll tell you like a man and I want you to act like a man. Your father was a handyman and fell from the big house. We buried him there. And the scarves? I remained a widow. Klime is an orphan. He did not keep his job with Evtim. And he followed the path of his father. God have mercy on his soul. Take care of me, child. Watch out for colds. You loosened up again. Listen to your mother, don't be self-willed. When will the train leave to escape your guardianship? You are Frosina with him as with a child. And he goes to work. The male. Not a joke, huh? Oh, if only he were a child. Again, happiness separates us. He was for the school to become educated. Fabulous. But... - But he wants food, huh? As you say: "An empty bag doesn't stand up straight." Well, enough of your jokes. Departs. Bless you. - Good health. Good health. - Let's go, Klime! Maybe the Lord will give us happiness. - Yes, Mother. So that you earn money, come back to me, become the owner. What your father couldn't... - Let's go, Klime! ... then you can, mother's child. Come on, Klime! - Maternal! - Went. Good health. - Good health. And those troubled times have come. Politicians have become bad. I mean, these great leaders Ah here is, divided relatives, friends. They brought us misfortune. Yes, not a word from Klime. Mother. - Klime! Child! And... a guest at the door? Is it you, Karavliya, I'm sorry. Mother's only son! Child! The army is blockading the city. Does that mean? They are chasing me. Dogs. Reported to the police. - And now... You will have to get me out of the city. Just don't panic. It's OK. Son, the only one! - Why are you interfering in our men's affairs? I know the streets well. Faster. - With God, mother. Hey! - Well, stop! Who stop? - Sorry, lieutenant. At ease! Please! And now? I have a friend in the city. But... So what's now? You can't stay here. Do you have an acquaintance, a certain Uncle Kuzman? He must be a good person, huh? - But how! We are almost family! We go to him. Went. Excuse me. - Mercy. Where have you been until now, daughter? You don't sit still! - Aunt Tsara had one. Luckily, I followed her. Luckily you were by her side. I ask for a cup of coffee, lieutenant, it's still early to bed. With pleasure, madam. With pleasure. Good evening, Mr Bakalov. - Good evening. - Good evening, Father. My regards. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. We'll catch another bandit. This is not good. - Don't worry, Mr. Bakalov. Every day I hear it. Every day! Don't worry. How not to worry? Read. The prices set by the Food Administration, at which producers will have to buy chickpeas on the newly liberated lands, amount to twenty-nine leva. And who bought chickpeas from the peasants? We are local merchants. And what were the prices then? Thirty-five leva! Six leva loss means! Manufacturers from the old borders, because we have no factories! Manufacturers from the old frontiers. Openly! Calm, Mr. Bakalov. Calm. What about poppy? What about tobacco? No. We are orphans here. Who is the mother, who is the stepmother. All will be. Everything will be fine. Only... the heart of the young lady Lyuba will not soften. I'm going to bed. Something hurts my head. - Well, rest, daughter. And the local authorities won't blink an eye. At least the mayor is local, he is nowhere to be found. If I were in his place... - Come what may. Only patience. For nothing else! It hurts me like an old Bulgarian, militia, frontline fighter. The people must be satisfied little by little. Otherwise, he will feel bad. Bulgaria will live and it will be even better. In these Bulgarian places will live such a pleasant free life. I think one of your tenants should soon be yours... Your daughter and I... Don't worry. I'm here. The one who loves you has become a little wild. Do you know how it is? Everything has its time. Guests! Take it away. Quietly, to the hearth. If he's your friend, then so is ours. There. Oh poor thing. Could you not let us know that we would come with a horse? For such a wounded man to walk from the city itself? Such was the case! He is in a hurry. - Really, friend, who hurt you? Why these questions? Who, how, why. Like women at the gate. The man is not well, but he... Hey! What are you staring at in Klime? Can't you hear what they say to you? - Listen, grandpa. First, hot water and rakia. Are you some kind of teacher? You know a lot. I say, see a lot, what is it, what is it? - The saddle is being changed. Some say: "Ours is better." Others: "No, ours." And the saddle... Everyone knows. - The teacher is correct. Saddle and nothing else! Give! Give it to me! In the era of the uprising learned. - Ilindensky? - Still would. I have five wounds in strength. And I still keep the gun for... Maybe...? I heard that in some villages there are rebellions, they don't give up. Yes, but how else! - Please don't interfere, we'll be burned. Oh you! You're getting into politics too! Go quickly, get people something to eat. - So. And now it... will pass. In three days you will be like a sparrow on a tree. Now tell me if you want... who hit you, huh? - I beg. These fascists. - They have done many atrocities, brother. They are not up to good and jokes. As you say, fascists, I know them well, as a Turk, when I was a committee. And these are even worse. - Please, have a bite to eat. Sorry, this is how it happened. Such words that I will never hear from you again. Aunt, some water, if I may. This is real Macedonian chocolate for you. We sing one song... - And where is your song from? They sing a song. For all dried trout. "And I ate, and gave to the village. Pop married his daughter and married his son, And I still have." Well, it's the same here. A whole battalion eats up... - And there will be more. How many of our... how do you say battalions, so to speak? I don't have change, sir. - Okay, I'll give it to you next time. I am a poor man, I have children. Away! - Please, sir... - Get out! Where, young lady? - I'm in a hurry, I have work to do. May I join you? - Mercy. Have you come yet? - She came anyway. Are you worried about something? - As always. Why, Lyuba, aren't you glad we saw each other? No, I know, and I told you yesterday. You've been running from me lately. It's hard for me here. Everyone around me is bothering me. Both father and mother, and this rude Asen... - And me. No. Otherwise, I wouldn't be telling you this. You are a different person. And just on the way here, I thought. Let this be our last meeting. - The last one? Really so many hopes and all of a sudden? - I'll go somewhere. Sofia or wherever. I want to run away from here. Some of them made my eyes dark. Take this guy to the commandant's office. Let the girl go. Why, love, why is that? - Why? How do I know? Maybe two or three years ago I thought like a child about my future. And now I look: everything has changed. Scary. I can't find my place. Place? I will find it for you! I'm already into these things. I know a man, a doctor of souls, he heals instantly. Don't talk nonsense and beware. Take care. I'm not afraid of anyone. Eh, if you only knew. - I only know one thing. Get out of here as soon as possible. Yes, understand. So it's true what people say, you're going to marry a lieutenant! I told you about him! Well, yes, what is Klime. Klime is no match for you, fisherman. And Lyuba? Hey, Lyuba went to school. The daughter of a prominent rich man Evtima... - Enough! The most famous in the town. And that Bulgarian? Oh, he's an officer. True, a stranger, he came to rob us, but he has a uniform, boots, shoulder straps. Enough! In fact, their age is short, but not everyone can see it. Enough! Love! Oh, and are you out for a walk, young lady? - Yes. I'm glad we met. - I'm going home. - Wait, wait. What's the matter, boy? We'll meet again. - Good. - Rude! Oh mothers! Mother! Did I ever hug you like this? - No, son, no! Did I kiss you like this? - No, heart, no! Now I hug you, kiss you. What are you looking at me? Have I gone crazy? - Oh, it's chur our house chur! Listen. Today you need to sing in the house. - Oh, heart, sing you with me forever! You don't say anything to your mother. Are you preparing joy in the house for us, huh? With Evtimova Anyone? - With Anyone? No. I am not for her. She doesn't love me. It's better that way, child. Oo, where it is seen and heard! For the poor to be related to the rich! Here, Kalina Karavieva, tell me about her. - Good good! For another, I kiss you! Today, mother, is Easter. When do you wear Easter cake to church? You yourself know, to St. Clement. - So. And from now on you will wear it today! - Sin will overtake you. Why are you laughing at my old age? - I and laugh at you? Never! Wait, how can I explain... Let's just say I was born today. - What? - So, again. As Gotse would say, organised. Now do you understand me? Something... understood. So you are involved. Son, you are smart. You know these things better than me, old lady. All I know is that you can't be wrong. You don't think badly of your mother. - To keep you alive. But this time you were wrong! - I was wrong? - Wow, I was wrong! What's this? Are such things left openly? But I hid them. - I found them! When you have something to hide, tell your mother! Mother knows best holes in the house! Mother! Krste is waiting for me with a boat. Pick up the nets, I'm late. Mother of God, I'm afraid. Why are you so late? I thought something had already happened. We were waiting for more merchants. To mix with them. You know how it is. When a person mixes with many exhalations, he is not recognized. Frosina, how are you? You get stronger with youth, don't you? Oh, my empty youth. Welcome. - It's good to come, but how are we going to leave, eh? You leave happily. - Let's live, yes. Where are your sticks and plums? - Now. Mother, get those things you hid. Frosina, beware of those damned ones. Once a year they shoot themselves. Oh, Kuzman, Kuzman. How is Gotse, Kalina? Did his hand go? - Good. Uh... I forgot. He gave me a letter for you. "Finish with Kuzman and immediately come upstairs with them. Carefully on the road so that you are not found. There is no return. Gotse." Wait in the city near the pump. I will catch up with you. About waiting. I'll wait, but will the Bulgarians wait. I'll be back. - O.K. Well, bless you. - You too, sorry. Mother. I'm away on business, for a long time, you know... I feel like I need to leave. Just got to leave... I should. But don't think anything terrible. Son, you will go to the forest. Something like that, forest, you speak well. My child, you are smart, you know what you are doing. But for me, everything is gone, everything. - No need. You don't have to, mother. Son, burned to see you as the owner, to decorate this house. You are going into the unknown. In broad daylight I have not seen how much I support you, in broad daylight. She created worries for herself. And here... a mind that says otherwise. - That's right, Mother. So and nothing else? I don't know. I don't know how he does it but what you think is right, I know that. Just look, child Klime, to come back to me. Don't think too much, mother. Everything will be fine. And it's white day, as you say, I'll bring it to you as soon as I get back. Mother's son. How could it be otherwise? I took care of you like the apple of my eye. Day and night shook over you. Could it be otherwise? Well, goodbye. I'm in a hurry. Someone is waiting for me. Is it the first time for me to see people out of the house? And never again! Well, do you take me for someone else or what? And we are like sisters. Come on, take the flour, we know you don't have it. I don't need Veta. Found more. Klime God left me. - Left, figs left you. Veta, what are those words? Figure of God. - But don't I know how you were. Klime worked with my Krste. I know, I know, every batch was crosswise in the bottom of the barrel. - I felt very good. And leave me alone, you don't know anything. And it's good that I don't know anything. May it be so. Veta is telling me something. Klime will be back soon. Soon. Just let the Bulgarians and the Germans drive out. I'm afraid that not a hundred of us a track. I wove for the wedding, but it was not fate. And now I'm spreading it all over the house. From the kitchen to the path to that door. When Klime comes to step on it. And you know what he said to me when we parted? We will never part again. Never. Uh, something got on you. What are you teasing me for? What if he comes tomorrow? Kalina, won't you come? - I'll come. I'll come later. - Okay, daughter. Comrade commander, have you seen my father anywhere? Here he is, comrade Kalina, a little higher. What about Klime? Beautiful? - Beautiful, wonderful. I meant Kalina. Beautiful girl? - Beautiful. - Truth? What did I want to tell you? Ah, yes. Tomorrow at midnight we will attack the city. You will need to leave immediately. Krste will be waiting for you with armed men. And you have... ...command to attack take off. Madam, the Bible says, "I commit my spirit into your hands." I say, "I place my fate in your hands." Asen, don't worry. Go upstairs to your room and wait. I'll call you as soon as we sort things out. Mother, let me call you by that name. Mother! You are the noblest being I have ever met in my life. Dad, I told both you and mother, I'm not sitting here. At least kill. If you don't send me somewhere, I'll run away myself! Is there an owner in this house or not? Am I a father or...? - I cant. I know you want everything to go nice and peaceful as before. But now everything has changed. My heart hurts here. - What? What are you carrying? "Everything has changed, my soul hurts." Damn. What's wrong with you, crazy? Either not fed, or not dressed. Are you mad? - Mother! If she had considered me a mother, she would not have behaved so inappropriately in my house! You should get married, get a household. Children! And he and not anyhow who? Officer! And finally, think a little about your father. And to make things better for him! - Love, daughter. Be smart with me. Father and mother do not want bad things for their child. I can't dad. I want to learn. I'm not ready to get married yet. Wow, where is it seen that a girl studied in these wars. We do not know what awaits us tomorrow - the day after tomorrow, and she is "learning". Wait until you're like your aunt Tzara at forty. When even the janitor Arif won't take you! I said what I said! Will I allow myself? Come on, lucky one, God bless you. - Is it possible to? So, young lady Lyuba agreed? - It happened. A little embarrassed when we said what you would do. I suddenly got up. Sit down, sit down, Asen. Lyuba... so, agreed. It just takes...a little time... Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the ring and nothing more. - God, I'm so happy. One week is needed, if you will. I'm leaving... you know... service and stuff. I'll catch all the forest ones! - And if something happens to you, son-in-law! Thanks for your last word. Son-in-law. How beautifully you pronounce. And don't worry, madam. I'll catch everyone! Everyone! Everyone, son-in-law, we will catch! I also want and enjoy. But... Evtim just said that. Who listened to him, old donkey? The people must be satisfied. Give him something. No. No! But here you are now, here you go. I know! That's right! - Come on, have a bite, don't talk now! Enough! Enough! Stop! I have not seen anything. - I saw him! There was a man! Jumped into the garden. Maybe you thought so! - I saw him! Stay here. We will report to Lieutenant Asen. Mr Lieutenant! Open! Should it have come to this? I say, worry in vain... - You canâ€™t do otherwise without your politics! There are people smarter than you. They know their business. Now let's look at the joy in the house! Mr Lieutenant! Open! What could it be? Now! Now! - We are here. Mr Lieutenant! The man jumped over the wall here into the house. Thief or what, we don't know. - Let's check! Let's do it! Fast! Fast! Who's there? Klime. What do you need here? Leave! - They are looking for me, there was nowhere to go and... What do you want? Leave! - Nothing will happen. They will leave. And me too. Who saw him, the inventor? - I saw him, Lieutenant. You saw him... Leave. Closed, lieutenant. Is it with Luba? Drop this thing. Excuse me, Lyuba, have you seen any bandit? No, I didn't see anyone. Have you even heard footsteps in the garden? No, I didn't hear anything. - Sorry to bother you. Sneaky cowards! Afraid of your own shadow! Mister lieutenant... - At ease! No, Klime, don't. Oh oh! My heart sank to my heels. Such things in our house, respectable! - Don't worry. Exactly today! - Relax, everything will be fine. Again, Mina, if there was someone who jumped over... Don't worry, madam. Goodnight. No need. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Lie down on my chest And sing me a beautiful love song. The commander has not yet arrived. Mother of God, Mother of God, save him for me. Fast! Fast! O.K.! O.K.! O.K.! I'm leaving. For a wonderful love... Mother of God. Everyone is here? - We are here. - Klime, child! We were very worried that you were gone. - Get up, there's no time to wait. Shall we go, Klime? - Now. Mother. We have business now. See you. Mother of God, help. Blood? My son! Lieutenant Asen! Where? - Grandma, you can't be with us. Come back! You're the one! - Is that you, Frosina's mother? It's dangerous here. A bullet will hit you. - It will hit me! I got hit the night you stole Klime from me. - Mother. My child is injured. I would like to find him. And bandage it! Klime! Klime! Not here! My child is like a mother. Be alive with me! No. No! Mother will look after you, take care of you like the apple of her eye. Your mother won't let you go. How...ours? Good. - And you? They scratched a bit. Looks like mother. Mother. Mother's child! - Nothing? Nothing, son, nothing! Nothing! - Nothing is...? - Nothing is! Klime! Klime! Don't leave your mother! Klime! Klime! Don't leave your mother! White Day... Gone is the child of broad daylight. How, Klime, shall I bury you? One... You are not alone, mother. Is the attack over? - It's over. Here is the commissar. Wait! Just a little bit! I will go. I'll follow her. Go. Aunt Frosina, Do you want something? I want to cover it with a path. Weaving for him, for his return to me... Squad, forward march! Salute! Left! Mother Frosina. Mother. - I'm sorry for the words I said to you. But I was desperate. Thank you, mother. God bless my children! - Thank you. And who will look after Gotse? - Me, my friends. No, you are young. He needs... maternal care! THE END
