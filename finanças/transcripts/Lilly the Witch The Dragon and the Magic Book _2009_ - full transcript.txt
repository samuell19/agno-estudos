"LlLLY THE WlTCH" Goodness! So far up! I'm really high up! What a flight! lt must have been 8... no, 9 seconds! I'm... I'm... the greatest. Surulunda! Did you see me? Hektor, Hektor! My clean laundry! Did you fall from the tree? Fall from the tree? I'm the best flying dragon in the Dark Forest. You'll never fly with that belly! Belly? Are you talking about my flying muscles? From your crash landings, more like. Crash landings? Does this... look like a crash landing? I'm going to split my sides laughing! l can fly! -And l'll prove it to you... some day. -Hello? Hello! Yes? -I'm a poor girl who's lost her way. -Oh, how terrible! But you don't have to be afraid with me. I'm Surulunda, the good witch of the Dark Forest. Oh, who do we have here? -What's his name? -He's my little Serafim. -Care for a coffee? -Yes, thanks. A real person! l haven't seen one in over 1 00 years. A real person? lsn't a dragon a real person? -l hope she won't eat my cake. -Come on, don't be shy. -Do you like chocolate cake? -l should've known. What's a pretty young girl doing alone in the forest? "Alone in the forest..." Since Hieronymus has been lurking around, no one is safe. -Hieronymus? The great wizard? -Great wizard? He's a bungler! Hektor? All he can do is turn into someone else. And just for a few minutes. Then he turns back to Hieronymus. My magic book. Yes, he's after my magic book, but he can forget that idea! And I don't want to gossip, but he eats flies! -Well, if he likes them... -l find it quite unappetizing. l prefer my tasty cake. But only one piece each. -One? -Yes, only one! Eeny, meeny, witch's brew... l think l'll eat you! Okay, just one. -Hektor! -How cute! And I heard that the idiot... tried to do a spell, and by mistake... turned his assistant into a dog! Do you have a problem, pug-nose? No, but you will have, frog-face! Surulunda, watch out! -l think there's some dust in my eye. -She's Hieronymus! Be quiet! You ate all the cake! We'll talk about that later. My eyes... Can you see the blacks of my eyes? -Look deep into my eyes. -She's Hieronymus! Hieronymus! Soon you'll tell me where the magic book is hidden. The magic book! Give it to me! The book, the... -Hieronymus! -He turned himself into a pretty girl. My goodness! lf he'd got my book... he could've built the world domination machine. lt would've been disastrous. Ah, my little Hektor! -Surulunda is getting old. -But you're only 427! Yes, but I'm too old to protect the magic book. l need to find someone to take over for me. And there's no time to lose. Hurry up! This way! Stop right there! You won't get away so easily, Hieronymus. Fari-Mori, begone your fears! You're grounded for 1 00 years! Surulunda, you silly old dame! The great Hieronymus! Grounded! l'll show her! You know what l'll do? l'll just walk out the door! Grounded! Me? Ridiculous! -Hey, Hiero! -What? Your foot! Okay, l'll go get the dice cup and some snacks. Me? l have to protect the magic book? That's right. You have to guard it until the new witch has passed the test. But... I'm just a little dragon. Just a little dragon? You're the Dark Forest's best dragon! l wouldn't trust anyone else. But how do I find the new witch? l can't concentrate on an empty stomach. And... You won't go in search of her. The book will find her for itself. But I warn you: Until the new witch... has passed the test, stay alert! Don't let yourself get distracted by food. Sure. To distant lands you now shall ride, let your heart be your guide! Fly now, to a distant place, hurry, there's no time to waste. Good luck, Hektor! The two of you will find a worthy replacement for me! Hocus pocus fidibus... and the die is gone. You have to secretly take it out first. Then do it yourself if you think you can do better. One would be really good at spells. l'd be the best witch in the world. Lilly! Leon! Where are you? Oh, Lilly, you cooked. That's great! l finished my model, Mom! You have to come and see it. Hey, not bad! Super-surfer, ol?! Hektor, the surfing... l worked on it for a whole week. lt's really... Leon! That jerk! He threw his dinosaur on my model! Lilly! You shouldn't hit him. Let's talk about it. l don't want to! My lovely model! lt would've been the best in the class. He always breaks my things. How about if I help you to rebuild it? Leon, apologize this instant. -Sorry. But I didn't do it. -Oh? Did it happen by magic? Leon's a lot younger than you. -Leon. Come upstairs, honey. -You're so mean! You always take his side, never mine! l've got the dumbest brother ever! No one can get in now. l'd do anything to make that jerk vanish for ever. What's that? "O": Orchestral music. lf you desire orchestral music... move your fingers as if playing the flute... and say aloud: Condrobulatix... Musicum! l can't hear anything. "lf the din starts to annoy you, you just have to say: Condroblu... blumoz musi-ex!" "G" stands for grisly, deadly monster. You can conjure up a grisly, deadly monster... by snapping your fingers and saying: Loborium Lapusium Shrick Shreck. What a load of nonsense. -To get rid of it again, just say... -Lilly? -What do you want? -Lilly, open this door! Since when do we lock doors around here? "To get rid of it, say: Shrack, schreck, monster's gone." What do you want? Lilly, you know that I hate locked doors. Yeah... I'm going down to work in the bookstore. l'll take Leon to Granny Klaarssen. -Are you doing your homework? -Yes. Look what a mess he is. Where did you get him from? Look, he's got real dinosaur skin. -l'll give him to Rex. -l am Tyrannosaurus Rex. -l can fight! -l'll bite your head off. -Fly high, Rexy! -I'm sure they'll be best friends. Now come along. -Bye, Lilly. -Bye, Mom. -Bye, silly! -Don't come back, jerk! How long do I have to sit here? l have a bruise on my backside. The world domination machine... -l was this close! -Oh, yes. lf only I could rule the world just once! lf only I could control mankind just once, and then... Surulunda is losing her power. She's passed on the magic book. Then we can get out of here. We'll go and get it now, Serafim! And my revenge will be grisly! l am Tyrannosaurus Rex. l can fight. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Er... maybe you should just... lie down to get your strength back. You'll be up in a jiffy. Where has that cursed book catapulted me to? Oh, the magic book! Curse it! Where has it gone? l have to find it! I gotta... l gotta... l gotta get something to eat! Pickles... with whipped cream! Fish sticks... with chocolate sauce! Hello? Surulunda? "Wreak havoc with a horde of monkeys. Put your middle fingers on your nose and say: Beronimor, Beronimor, Biluch." What a load of poo! Magic book! Only babies believe... l have to distract them! They'll wreck my room! Bananas and... Ah yes, milk! -Dino? -N-n-no, dragon. I'm Hektor, the guardian of the magic book. -What? The book belongs to you? -Yes! Kind of. Are you real? I'm looking for the new super-witch. ls there a wise old lady, about 1 60 years old, who lives here? My mom's old... but she's not that old. The monkeys! lt's your magic book, right? Help me get rid of them! Hurry! But the magic book... Hey! "Put both middle fingers in your nose and say: -Middle fingers! -""Beronimor flutch flutch!" No! Oh, holy frog farts! l don't believe it! You're so cute! What's going on here? Why? Middle fingers! "Beronimor flutch flutch!" Mommy... the room was full of baby goats, and Lilly magicked them away. More like a horde of monkeys! By the way, Leon didn't break my model. But he's still a jerk. Really, Mommy! They were eating bananas! -Really! -Leon, you shouldn't make up stories. Hey, I didn't make it up! -A perfect landing. -l feel sick! Now we'll get the book, Serafim. Then we'll build the world domination machine and control mankind! l need my medication. Don't look so sad. The magic book must have lost its way. lt's a very old book, after all. Yes, it's easy to get the wrong address. Stop it! We can't stay here. We have to find someone to take over from Surulunda. The search ends here. You didn't lose your way? You just have to look closely. Before me stands the new super-witch... Lilly. Super-witch? Yes, it's a great honor... but a difficult task too. You have to pass a 99-hour trial period... and prove you're a worthy super-witch. -Otherwise... -Otherwise what? Hieronymus will get the magic book... and the world will turn gray and gloomy. You can't let that happen, Lilly. You have to turn me into a human when you get the book! And without hair on my back! But if you pass the test... you'll be Lilly... ol?, ol?, the super-witch! Are you brave enough? Lilly the Witch... l'll give it a try. The 99-hour trial period begins... now! Dino can really talk. Hektor is hungry. Hektor must go poo. How dare you come into my room! Mommy, Lilly's gonna kill me! lt makes me sad when you fight with Leon. What is that? The new super-witch? A dumb kid? -Sleep tight. -Good night, Mom. Close the window to keep out the bugs. Did you study for tomorrow's math test? Of course. All afternoon. Good. Oh, no! The math test. But if I can do spells... l can pass the math test. Lilly the Witch, we... We'll meet again! Excuse me, very sorry! Are you nuts? Where did you learn to drive? lt was your idea to come. You're in the trial period. I have to see if you'll be a good witch. Look, these are all spells. School will be fun today. But you can't... -Can't do what? -Hello, Lilly. Hi! Er... hi. -Will you go to the stables later? -Where else? -Do you want to go with us? -l'll think about it. Girls! That was Andreas. lsn't he cute? Then why did you brush him off? l can't let him know I'm in love with him. Kudos to you. Great tactic. You don't know a thing about boys! -Hi. -Hello, Lilly. Hi. And then Andreas said: "Hi, Mona. Wanna go for an ice cream?" -Really? Wow! -Cool. Hey, Lilly. Look at my pearls. lt was really expensive. Yeah, but it wouldn't look good on Lilly. No, not at all. Did you see her shoes? What should she wear with her flat feet? Pilerium, pilarium! Lilly! Are you crazy? That's an evil spell! Change 'em back! Or you can forget being a super-witch. But they look much better. Only if they want to join a circus. -Pilerium, pilar... -Hello, Mona. Hello! Please! You can't put those poor tails on such nasty girls! I'm afraid l'll have to make a note... Pilerium, pilarium, pilex! Good morning, Mrs. Grach. As you know, we have math test today. -Not again! -The last one was a disaster. Didelum, didela, make her words true. I'm sure no one'll make any mistakes this time. Yes! Okay... A room... is filled... with 8,600 gallons... of water. -lf we then add... -"Make her words true!" ...another 7,000 gallons... -Er... Mrs. Grach? -Not now, Andreas. And another... 20,000 gallons... -Mrs. Grach! -Quiet. -There's water everywhere. -Very funny, Andreas. How much water... is in the room? What is that? 36,600 gallons. Help! The second problem was about water too. lf a shark swims in 27,000 gallons of water, how many sharks... "Make her words true!" That was great, huh? Classroom flooded... school property damaged, clothes ruined... children caught a cold... billions of cold germs released... and above all, a certain handsome dragon... was almost drowned. Actually I wanted to do a different spell. You wanted to be the new super-witch! 1 0, 20... 1 , 2, 3... That's the largest hall we're selling. What do you want it for? Oh, just a little world domina... A machine to dominate the world... with amusement. Yes. And we could live there. Our HQ! What? That dump? l mean, that wreck of a house? Actually, it's a castle. And it's very expensive. Now that's what I call a warm welcome. Yes! A bit of dirt on the walls... a few cobwebs here and there, and in the living room... coffins! Dust in my eye. Could you look? Okay, it costs 340,000. Let's say, 1 00,000 on sale. And since November comes before May next year, let's say, 1 000. And because we're friends, let's say it's for free. Very good, Master. -We'll take it! -Very good, Master. A good deal, huh? Yes, but without the magic book, we're sunk. What's this? Those kids shouldn't take the books out of the store. Hey, pretty good! -Cool. -Oh, too bad. Try again. Here! Damn! To me! -Lilly, what are you up to? -Wait. This is a thing... "What touched your sweetheart"s foot." The medieval love spell? -Amorisi, amorosi, heart to heart... -No! ...Shnip shnap! -Oh, great! You don't know if that "A" is for Andreas. Who else? -Hi, Adelmann. -Hi, Alex. Hello, Lilly, honey! Hello, Alfred. Oh! Thanks. Hello, Lilly. May I share thy company? Yes, sure. Did you have a riding lesson today? l wish only to be by thy side, Lilly. Hey, Andreas! Are you playing? No, I shall stay awhile with Lilly. The queen of my heart. Hello. l'd like some peppers. -How many? -About 6. -Coming right up. -lf they're all so small, l'll take 7. -What are you cooking? -Stuffed peppers. You'll need some garlic, and you should take some onions... That's the wrong display! Hey, try looking down! How about a little transformation spell? Good idea. Yes! l'll bewitch her with this beautiful physique. Go and get the magic book before your muscles go limp! Can I help you? Yes. Do you maybe have... a book? Keep an even distance apart. Lilly! Waiteth for me! And slow to a walk. Heareth me, O enchantress! Lilly, take this horse's brush as a token of my love. Very funny! Wait! lf you love me that much, get me a drink! l'll hurry. l warned you. His socks stink like cheese, too. Oh, yeah... camembert, gouda, emmental, tilsit... l'd kill for a cheese platter! Amorisi, heckameck, love... Oh, sweet honey bear... break the spell now! Bye. "Honey bear" Are you crazy? -What are you saying? -Hello, Andreas. Look, my dad bought it for me. Come and see my new horse. What a nerve! $44.90, please. Oh, dust in my eye! Could you look? -Hello, Mom. -Oh, Lilly. The dust! Look deep into my eyes. Just rub them. How was school? Nice. -And your math test? -Easy. -Good. Got any homework? -No. -l have work to do. -Latest tests show... ...that dogs are too stupid to read. -Oh, the pug! Lilly, he's Hieronymus! The book! -The book? -Yes, hurry! The book! -The book! -Yes. 44.90, please. -You can't sell it to that meanie! -Lilly! -Just because he's got... -The dust! Here, in my eye. Please! You can't sell it! ...a different body awareness... -Get the book, man! -The book. -Don't let go, Lilly. I'm coming! -Stay out of it... ...you fat toad! -Fat toad? You wait! Missed! -Yes, you will! -Stop it, Lilly. -Lilly! -Oh no! -Lilly! -My dust! Look deep into my eyes. Mom, don't! $3.60, l'll pay next week. Got it? -Good. -You can't sell the magic book, Mom! Thanks, Lilly the Witch! That is, ex-witch! Serafim! No one can stop us now. Now the world will turn gray and gloomy, and it's all my fault. What ever will we do, Lilly? I'm gonna get it back! -Lilly, wait! -What are you doing here? l don't want you to steal Dino. l want to play with him. Okay, but I have to go home with Hektor to get something. Yes, we have to hurry and get the... Heck! .Hektor lost his book. -Leon... Hektor and I are going in there. You stay here and guard the bikes. -No, I'm coming with you. -You're our spy! Spy very important. Don't want to. Okay, you can have my DS. The headphones too. Hurry up. l want to be human again. Just a moment. This here... could be right. Canivotrix... porilotrium... mutaborius! At last, I'm human again. Thank you, Hieronymus. Serafim, there's one... ...small problem. -What? The leash? I can easily... -Hieronymus, you'll pay for this! -Just a moment... -Otaboris, otaboris! -Hieronymus! Thank goodness. l'd rather be a pug than some kind of mish-mash. Strange, I can't lick my nose anymore. Maybe you have a nose cramp, or... a tongue contraction? Hey, Hieronymus! Lauratorium, ex ex! Serafim... you won't... The magic book! l think l'll put it in my room for safekeeping. Damn! Hektor? Somehow he reminds me... Serafim, come with me to the factory. We have work to do. -You stay here and keep a lookout. -Sure. But be careful. l hope it works out okay. Lilly, where are you? No! Not now! Oh, jam! l have to keep a lookout. l must not get distracted. l must not... l must... l simply must try it! -My book! -Get out of there! Come down from there! Come down! -I'm stuck! -You have one last chance... or l'll come and get you! Well... you want to play hide and seek? And what happens if l... find you? -You know my favorite food? -Damn! Little girl jam... with dragon meat! -Our little Lilly hid herself well. -"House pull, house stretch..." "Only for experienced witches." Tsagang, tsagang, ziwumm! The book! The book! Give me the book! Enough fun and games! Give me the book! Now! Help! Now l've got you! Come here. What's Lilly up to? A pug! Hello, doggy! Hey, kid! You came just in time! So, you little brat! Looks like l've got you trapped. Lilly! When I get you... l'll get you soon! Enough spells, little miss! Now you're in for it! lt's all gone dark! Hektor, hurry! Leon? Damn, where is Leon? Leon! Leon! Lilly! Look what I caught in my yard. A little rat. Let go of my brother, you nasty guy! Only if you give me the magic book. -No way. -As you wish. l have a little dungeon in my cellar. You like animals, right? There are snakes, spiders and bats! Hieronymus can't get hold of the book. lf he does, he'll take over the world. -Lilly, help! -What about Leon? Yes, I know he's got your brother. But you need the book to be a witch. Well? lt's your decision. Lilly! Help me! Put it down. Yes! Lilly, before I went over to the pug, l was a great spy. Hieronymus has the magic book and can build his machine! -And hypnotize all the grown-ups. -You have to help us, Mom! Hieronymus, the Master? You see... He told me I should sell law books. Mom, your store looks silly. Are you hypnotized too? The Master... l have to follow the Master's orders. Mommy... Oh, no! Hektor was right. I'm too young and stupid. l lost the magic book. And Hieronymus can build the world domination machine. What if Mom stays like that? Hello. Are you Lilly? Thank goodness. I just landed in the neighbor's bathroom. How embarrassing! Who are you? I'm Surulunda and I was the super-witch before you. Now, come here. Hurry up. Pay attention, Lilly. I'm going to show you my witch jump. We have to spin really quickly. And don't spit up in my direction. Faster... much faster! Lilly, I'm very proud of you. All the bad witches in fairy tales... thought doing spells was the main thing. And that's why they turned evil. But you, my child, have proven that you have a good heart. You have all the qualities necessary to be a super-witch. First you have to get the magic book from Hieronymus. But you'll need some help. No one can do everything on their own. But he's hypnotized almost everyone. But not the children. He can't hypnotize children so easily. Hieronymus is clueless when it comes to children. Now we're going to ask the oracle who should help you. Come along. Your sweetheart, a silly cow, an egg-head, a jerk... and a dragon you'll need! You know who they are? You can't influence a magic book. lt makes its own decisions and chooses normal little girls. Just like I used to be. But a super-witch is nothing without her friends. So don't forget: You need friends, lots of good friends. Lilly, can I come into your bed? l want Mommy to be nice again, like she used to be. l had such a lovely dream. And now everything's bad again. -Where did you get that earring from? -lt was... it was in my dream. lt doesn't really exist... The earring! Surulunda! lt wasn't a dream! What? Surulunda was here? What did she say? That friends have to stick together to defeat Hieronymus. Friends? ls that all she said? Nothing about me? A dragon can be useful if you want to save the world. Especially a flying drag... Stand up! Be seated! Children, drawing and sports are for kids. They're banned. From now on: a double dose of math! Pencils out! Arithmetic and more arithmetic! First: 327,679... "Your sweetheart... a silly cow... an egg-head... a jerk... and a dragon you'll need." No, Lilly's right. I'm a real dragon. A flying dragon... to be precise. I'm helping Lilly get the magic book back, and we need your help. We can't defeat Hieronymus alone. Hieronymus has hypnotized all grown ups. And soon he'll rule the whole world. And only we can stop him. Watch out! Hieronymus is coming! Come on! Hurry! This way. What are you doing here? Hey, stable boy! l want to buy all your ponies. -Hands off my animals, bathrobe! -But, but... l love animals. Look into my eyes. Could these eyes lie, kid? l need workhorses for my machine. Take them to the old factory. The old factory. Very good, Master. What a mess this place is in! Get rid of the kids! Slaughter the animals! Then you can earn lots of money for the Master! Good idea, Master. Alfred, what happened? -l gave him all my ponies. -What? I'm opening a slaughterhouse here. -What? -The sooner I slaughter them... ...the more l'll earn for the Master. -But Alfred! You can't do that! Get off my land! Brats! Or do you have a permit? He's been hypnotized. -l know where the old factory is. -Great. Come on. Be careful with the shrink-wrapping! The prisms are very valuable. Bring the Anti-matrix yoghurt here. Move all that back. -There! -Look! Mrs. Grach. My dad. That was the last delivery. We can start the machine. Yes, I can hardly wait. Did you hear that? We have to hurry. Come on! -The poor ponies! -How mean! The world domination machine! The bolidism transformer... At last! Yes! l read about that on the lnternet. lt transmits brain waves. Hypnotic rays! So, let's see... But he needs a synapse catalyzer too. And it hasn't been invented yet. The magic book is the catalyzer! With that machine, he could hypnotize the world at one fell swoop! -But he didn't reckon with us! -Right! Jonas, you're the computer genius. Got any good ideas? You see that red cable? l could try to re-program the bolidism transformer. But I need some kind of computer. How about my DS? -lt might get a bit scratched. -What? Please, Leon! Okay. So, we just need one little thing... What happens when you've hypnotized the whole world? Then all humans will work for me. Freedom will be abolished! Children... Children will be sent to work camps. -Now! -lt will be paradise... for me! My microphone was just here. Where is my microphone? The Master needs a microphone. No matter. Let's start the transmission! Didn't you hear? Raise the antennas. Hurry! Very good, Pug! Get a move on! Who's that? ls it a new show? Dear viewers... around the world. My name is... Hieronymus. My friends call me Master. l'd like... Ouch! l've got some dust... in my eye. lt you would all... take a good look... deep... into my eye. Yes, that's right. Very slowly... slowly... you are losing your will. You are feeling tired. More and more tired. -Do you think it'll work? -No idea. I hope so. You will only do... Lilly, hurry up! ...what the Master tells you. You will only do... what the Master wants. You will only do... -I'm into the system. -Cool! And I want... ...l want you... -l want you to just ignore this guy. Don't let him hypnotize you! Go and play with your kids! That's that! GAME OVER Lilly! Lilly, you small-time witch! Get her! Go! I'm coming for you! Quick! Switch to screen interference! Out of my way. Look into my eyes. The magic book! Lilly, we have to save the book! My book! Come on! l've got it. Good job. Let's go! Lilly, in here. Quick! Hurry up, Hektor! Ouch! Damn it! Well, it could've been worse. Just needs a good sweep. Lilly and her gang of rascals! Up there! Get them! -Let's go! Hurry! -Get them! Run! Hurry! That way! Hurry up! No! Hurry! Oh, no! Move! So, children... it's the end of the line. What's Hektor up to with that sock? The love spell! Hektor, get Hieronymus's sock! Oh, this is really high! lt's really, really high up! Extremely high. Hektor, you can do it! Out of my way! I'm coming! Come here, you flying grease ball! -Great, Hektor! -Look, Lilly. I can fly! Amorisi, amorosi... Middle finger, not your index finger! Amorisi, amorosi... -The love spell! No! -...shnip shnap! Dearest Lilly... ...Thou art the fairest. -Hieronymus... ...she's hexed you! -The fairest of the fair. Wake up! The sweetest of the sweet. Wouldst thou... take a stroll with me? ln the moonlight? Hands off, Lilly's mine. -Don't touch her. -Wait. Don't touch her. Hieronymus, I'm just a little girl. A big guy like you scares me. No problem, dear Lilly. For thee I would do anything, my sweet! That's better. But if you love me, how about this big? As thou willst. -Well? ls that better? -Much better. Lilly! Yippee! We did it! Lilly... my honey drop! -Let me out! -Forget it! You can stay there till you rot! Oh, man! Please! -Pumpkin! -Follow my commands! Go on, be happy! Bravo, hurrah! They don't look very happy. l flew! I really, truly flew! Crazy! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's me, Super-Hektor! Surulunda? Surulunda! l saved the world! And I flew! If only you'd seen me! I did see, Hektor. Dear Lilly... the trial period of 99 hours has reached an end. Hektor was right. I'm too young to be a real super-witch. Hektor, may I see the notes you made? Of course, I wrote everything down. It says here... Oh, I'm really sorry. When a super-witch... has found someone worthy to take over after many, many centuries... she can retire as a good fairy. And Surulunda has found the perfect replacement: Lilly the super-witch! What? So I can stay as a witch? Hektor, you fulfilled your task! So, that's that. I'm going home now. Bye, Lilly. You're pretty cool for someone under 1 00 years old. And you're the sweetest dragon l've ever met. You can call me with this any time. -Page 167 in the magic book. -Thanks. -Are you crying? -Who, me? No. l've just got something in my eye. Bye, Lilly. See you soon. ln maybe 200 years. Goodbye, Lilly. -Oh, yes. I have a forgetting spell. -Keep your dragon chin up! And don't forget me! Children? Don't you want to play? Off you go. Start having fun! -Mona! -Dad! Should we watch a film? l don't feel like work today. Bye, Lilly! And I thought you were a silly cow! You're the best stupid sister in the world. Right, Andreas? l don't know. But she's the coolest girl in the school. Let's go. Yes! Look, they're playing. Can we meet later? -l have to go home. -Take care. Bye.
