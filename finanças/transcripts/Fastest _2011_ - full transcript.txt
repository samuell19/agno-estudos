Lorenzo brakes, closes the door. Very smart move, fairing to fairing in the chicane. He's trying to get past. Jorge won't let him. Final lap. Lorenzo in front, Rossi behind. Attention, attention. They've been together all race long. Faster, faster, faster here! Go, go! More, more faster! Jorge's beating him hand to hand. It's crazy, he'll be leading the championship. Go Valentino, go! Head to head. On the inside, Jorge's really got him. Three corners to win the Catalan Grand Prix. Almost impossible. Very, very difficult. Lorenzo ahead, Rossi behind. There's no room here. What a race. He's got one corner left. He's going for the inside. I don't believe it. I can't believe it. He's done it. I can't believe it. It's impossible. Bravo! What a race. What a pass. How did he do it? Rossi's done it. Bautista had a compound fracture of his left clavicle operated on a week ago. He also had thoracic bruising and broken ribs. He wants to ride, and that is quite incredible. The rider has decided not to ride in Le Mans and be ready for the next race in Mugello. Ben Spies had a big fall with bruising to his foot and dislocation of the ankle. If all goes well, and he has the heart I saw today, he will do the race. Be water, my friend He was in here with concussion for almost a week. It scared him a bit. All of us feel fear. The thing is to overcome it. Here, motorcycles are more important than football. Here, motorcycles are number one. We were hoping for a great rider, and we got the greatest. The miracle of Valentino. Valentino and his motorcycle flying towards the stars. He was tiny when he first came here, and he collected Japanese toy figurines. He always loved Japanese things. He was not a normal child. At three, he was riding bikes with Graziano. Not normal. Valentino could have done something else. But his father led him to it when he was four years old. He was the despair of the police. When he races, we all dream. When he races, everything changes. I love watching the races. I had a Lambretta motorcycle. My phone number is 90-12-46. Valentino is and always will be a humble person from Tavullia, like us. Except he's a bit special. We had it specially printed in Milan. And we told Valentino, "You have to unroll it." He said, "How long is it?" Twenty-five meters. He said, "So long!" We said, "Don't win so much!" The most special was the first podium when he was very small. That was the moment we knew he was a real racer. All his races are beautiful. Especially Welkom when he beat Biaggi. The first year that he rode the Yamaha which Biaggi said was no good. With the Honda, he knew he could always win. But he said, "I'm winning, but I'm not having fun. "I prefer to have fun than win again." That's important. Not many people will leave a sure thing for something uncertain, like the Yamaha. There are far fewer serious injuries than 10 or 20 years ago. The injuries now are usually to the extremities of the skeleton, the bones of the hand, the feet, the shoulder and especially the collarbone. They fall a lot at the beginning. When they're on small bikes, they fall a lot. Then they stabilize, and when they're older, they start to fall again. With solo crashes, you might break a hand, but serious injuries are very rare. When they're in a group, and there is a faller, the others can run him over. That's the biggest danger. He learned a lot from Valentino. He's learned too much from Valentino. Valentino has developed the bike, and he's got the bike ready made. He's a copycat. We don't like him so much here in Tavullia. I noticed that Valentino was very anxious at this time. The violent impact of the foot on the asphalt broke the leg. And the broken bone pierced the skin and became exposed. I stabilized the injury and put the bones back in the body. It's not good for the bone to be exposed to the air. Together with Dr. Macchiagodena at Mugello, we arranged to get him to the operating theater in less than three hours, avoiding vascular complications. It takes a normal person five or six months if all goes well. I'll return fast! He's using the hyperbaric chamber, physiotherapy machines to improve the healing of the bone. It's his heart, his passion, his desire to escape the monotony of everyday, to return to the fatal attraction of the marvelous world of motorcycle racing. Valentino managed to reconcile me to motorcycles, because Graziano had a very big accident in 1982. Little by little, Valentino has revived in me a great love for motorcycles. Now that Valentino has hurt himself, I'm a little worried. He was dead. Graziano Rossi died in that corner. Because that corner was very dangerous, I had stationed a very good doctor there and he reached him within seconds and resuscitated him. In this world, the rider smiles when he confronts a fatal incident or drama. That is the beautiful thing, because life has meaning only when it stares death in the face. I started riding bikes when I was four years old. This is my twenty-first season. When I am home more than one week, I want to come back and ride. The whole structure of the shoulder was damaged, the socket, ligaments, muscles, cartilage. Braking. At the end of the straight, under hard braking. Valentino is like the conductor of an orchestra, coordinating the rhythm, the sound and the movement of the motorcycle. He has always been beautiful to watch on a motorcycle, but now with the shoulder injury, his style is not so flowing. He desperately wanted the 46th win on a Yamaha. He was in bad shape, but he fought for it. Many things have changed since that far-off time in 2004 when my M1 and I kissed for the first time on the grass at Welkom, when she looked straight in my eyes and told me, "I love you!" Valentino still has many things to do in motorcycling.
