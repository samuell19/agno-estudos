When this door opens the movie MARRIAGE will begin. I could've called it "A Man and A Woman". It stars Bulle Ogier and Rufus. I enjoyed working with them and with Marie Dea who is introduced. As usual, P. Uyterhoven and I wrote the dialogue. J. Collomb was in charge of the photography, helped by the great Jacques Lefrançois. If this film isn't silent, we owe it to J-L Ducarme. And if you understand everything, then G. Klotz and his assistant Françoise Orsoni did a good editing. If this film was advertised, blame it on Arlette Gordon. Tania was a good script girl. Eugene Bellin made sure our accounts were fool-proof. If the movie is a hit, the producer, FILMS 13, will gladly pay the taxes. Roles in the movie are played by the following talented people: Caroline Cellier, Bernard Lecoq, Charles Gérard, Harry Walter, Léon Zitrone, Gérard Dournel, Germaine Lafaille, Jean Soulard, Oskar Freitag. Music is by Francis Lai, Jo Privat & Edith Piaf. Many shots were made possible by these skilled technicians: André Atellian, René Lhomme, André Lefèvre, Claude Sichère, Henri Chiquel, Alain Fillon. Alain Basnier and J-M Perthus, assistant directors, got told off like no one else on the set. It's a sign of esteem. Finally, if the actors look better than life, blame it on Pierre Vadé, Joël Lavau and M-C Desouches. I'd also like to thank the following for their good temper: Michel Aumont, François Delamotte, Chantal Bécasse, Sylvia Châtelain, Jojo, Marie-Paule Prigeant, Manuel Terand, Gérard Sire, Les Editions 23, Eclair, Eurocitel, Eastmancolor, Billancourt, and the number 43338 delivered by the board of classification. Any resemblance to a true story is purely coincidental. The door may now open on MARRIAGE, with thanks to Sacha Guitry, who suggested this presentation. Presented by Claude Lelouch This is the garage. Watch out for the step. Please come in. This is the kitchen? It seems small. It's cozy. Just right for two. No windows... never any sun. A cool kitchen keeps food better. Now for the dining room... No, that's the toilet. - May l see? - How about a closet..? The dining room is this way. The dining room... with a sea-view, of course. It seems damp. It's damp. The house is very sound. It's not damp. See? You can brush it off. - Isn't that moss? - You can paint over it. It's saltpeter. Dry saltpeter. It's not damp. You brush it off and paint over it. Does that come with the house? This house brings luck. We were happy here for 30 years. So if you're superstitious... Thirty years! Well...it needs a lot of work. But you're young. My husband and I re-decorated it. We put in running water. And electricity. We were the first to have it in the whole region, in 1914. The electricity dates from 1914? It's lasted through two wars. It must be solid. Isn't there a bath? The bedrooms all have running water. How many bedrooms are there? One...plus a store-room. You can make it into a nursery. Then there's the attic... A nursery! What about heat? The cold never bothered us. Leaving the kitchen door open heats the whole house. Would you like to go up and see the bedroom? First, could we see the sea? When was the house built? About 50 years ago. - How's the roofing? - In perfect condition. Now I'll show you the bedroom. Are you natives of Normandy? My fiancée's from Evreux. I'm from Caen. But we met here...on vacation. If you take my little beach house it'll be like a vacation for life. Is it just for summers? Or year-round? Year-round. Year-round. That's the store-room. You can turn it into a nursery. And here's the bedroom. Running water. It only does that in the summer. Not enough pressure. The house is really quite sound. A little dampness never hurt anyone. - Pretty wallpaper... - Thank you, I chose it myself. The bed goes here? The light is just overhead. And, of course, the view on the sea. Can we see it again? You have sea and sun all day. It's the dampness. My husband always opened it. You just have to get the knack. You got lipstick on me again. Isn't my little beach lovely? They're very discreet, very polite. How much for your little castle? 300,000 francs. If the Allied landings take place here you're in the line of fire. If the Allied landings ever take place it'll be around Calais, not here. My husband fought in '14, he was sure. They won't land in Normandy. We'll see... There's still that blockhouse. They'll remove it, after the war. We'll see... And if the Allies land here... My husband always said it there were any chance of that you wouldn't see one blockhouse here but hundreds! You should see Calais! In consideration of the blockhouse you can have it for 250,000 francs. It's still too much. Too bad! - I'm very sorry. - It's nice but... Too bad. When are you getting married? In two weeks, right? Think it over but let me know soon. Some other people are interested. But I'd rather sell it to you. You see, when we bought this place my husband and I were your age. There was a war on then, too. And we were very happy here. So if you believe in omens... Only in round numbers...200,000? No...I'm terribly sorry. I'm a widow, this is all I have... I definitely don't like it. Really, I don't like it. But it's a bargain. But it's a bargain I don't like. After the war, it'll cost a lot more. I still prefer to wait and have a house I like. What can I say? After the war, prices will go up. Even so, let's not act foolish. Let's do act foolish! If not now...when? Let's act foolish in other ways. Care to try again...in French? Is too late...promenade...now. Good, huh? Very good! No accent... Well...hardly any. That's the way we have to go. Sorry about that. Well, here we are. Mrs Thierry.... I wish you great happiness in this house. On one condition... That we move to Paris after the war. I promise... by all I hold most dear. - What do You hold most dear? - You. This house isn't so bad, after all. It's not so bad. It's not even so damp, right? We had a crowd, didn't we? Good party... Lots of laughs... Yes, but...you really must learn to dance. Didn't we dance the night away? Look at my feet. It's your brother. Congratulations, Madam. I come to your house... to ask if maybe you have bread... for my breakfast. Bread...in war-time... He must have seen the bundle. Bread! Why not my wife, while he's at it? Dawn comes early, doesn't it? The longest days of the year are beginning. And maybe the best years of our lives. I like that... Are you sleepy? It's hardly the time... Okay! When y'gotta go, y'gotta go... You're strong. You smoke too much. After the war, I'll quit...I promise. You're clumsy. Better get used to it. - They're ugly. - Well, they're German... Worked it out, huh? It's man's work. You're strong... You...make war. We...make love. Aren't you a little hungry? Yes, if you are... Not hungry? Since the ceremony, all I've done is eat. Excitement whets the appetite. It's nice to be in love. It makes you forget the war. Think it'll last long? Love, or the war? War-time champagne. Want some? It's time... They're cute. It's tin foil. Tin foil...for a fuse! Dripping wax on it helps a lot. Your mother said you were handy. - Your mother? - Your mother! It's true. I am handy. After the war, I'll re-wire it. After the war? You said... Something funny's going on in there. You said after the war we'd move to Paris. It's going crazy... You said we'd sell the house and move to Paris. Sure, sure... Turn off everything but the radio. Stop giggling! Lights out. You've still got the candle! We don't need it any more. Don't cry! This is London. The French speak to the French. News Bulletin Number Eight. First, here are some personal messages: "I'm looking over a four-leaf clover." "The die is cast." "It's hot in Suez." "It's time to pick the tomatoes." "The children go naked on Sundays." (Code advising French Resistance Allied Invasion to begin in 48 hours) I'd better give them some bread! Are you alone? What is it, dear? Joining the Resistance on our wedding night... What luck! The Resistance joined us. Two minutes... Know how to use it? Are you sure today's the day? In 90 seconds, you'll be sure, too. I don't see any ships. Keep looking. Because in one minute... you'll see thousands. It's insane to land in this weather. That's what the Germans will think, too. Do you think we're in any danger? 30...29...28... four...three... two...one... One...one, two, three... At dawn on June 6, 1944... history was written... on these Normandy beaches. History written by we French... Americans, English, Canadians... Belgians and Dutch. We wrote it in fire and blood. We destroyed the German war machine... eliminated Nazi tyranny... and ensured our own security in a free world. At dawn on June 6, 1944... the tide had turned... The code names of the beaches were... Juno...Omaha...Utah... - Are You coming? - I can see fine from here. - Papa's a good speaker. - That's all he can do. - Are You coming or not? - I said I can see fine. That history-making invasion... brought to our shores... British regiments... America's 101st Airborne Division... and 58th Field Artillery Canada's Queen's Own Rifles... and Winnipeg Rifles Belgium's Piron Brigade The S.A.S. Parachute Battalion The Dutch Princess Irene Brigade And the French "Army of the Shadows..." under Commander Kieffer And now a minute of silence in honor of our fallen heroes. The minute is over The drinks are on General Tremblay! Let's go see Françoise later. I can't... It's my 10th anniversary. Maybe we can go tomorrow. But we'll say we're going... to Arromanches. To Arromanches. To the D-Day Museum. That gives us lots of time. That's what we'll say. A song dedicated to Mrs Tremblay... in honor of our town, St Aubin. Here are the headlines. Talks in Geneva... Indochina armistice under review. Holiday week-end begins: 175 extra trains scheduled, 10,000 police on duty. Hear the true story of an escape from the hell of Dien-Bien-Phu through 200 miles of Viet territory on foot in the jungle. Also, race results... But today's lead story is D-Day commemoration, ten years after the landings. French and American dignitaries saluted U.S. Marine and Army units at the Omaha Beach Cemetery. No more meat? Can I listen to the radio tonight? Not with your grades. Turn it off, I have to iron. Pick up your chair, please. Floor polishers! Is it off? Your homework done? Go get your father at the bistro. Your homework done? Then go to bed. What should I wear? Should I change? Janine, should I change? Papa, can I listen to the radio? Ask your mother, she's the boss. I'm talking to you! Should I change clothes or not? Change your tie, at least... Albert! Turn off your light! You know your mother's ironing! Now you'll stay home tomorrow! I won't take him to Arromanches... That's that. Why can't you iron in the daytime? - Get the City electrician in. - I've put in a formal request! Don't Resistance heroes get priority? Can't you turn off a few lights? Hurry or we'll be late. - Albert, is your light off? - Yes. - Yes, who? - Yes, papa. Hurry or we'll be late. You might have polished this today. - the red one. - the red what? The red tie that I like. Albert, tomorrow polish the German helmet. Yes. - Yes, mutt? - Yes, papa. Yoo-hoo! Isn't my dress pretty? Do you remember? - Isn't it pretty? - You don't remember? You said you'd stop smoking. I remember that. That I'd stop smoking strong cigarettes. Get the nuance? Let's be honest. You still haven't fixed that faucet! I'll die before I give work... to that Fascist plumber! Is he the only plumber in Normandy? Know what they charge for mileage? Don't touch that window... - It's too smoky in here. - You know it's hard to open. Is the carpenter a Fascist? Is the carpenter a Fascist? - What can a carpenter do? - It's just damp. It could be planed down. Planed down! Know what's out there? Have you seen what's out there? The Channel! What can a carpenter do... all alone against the Channel? Excuse my language, but...shit! Where are my cuff-links? Hurry or we'll be late. - You should have reserved. - I did. Chez Simon, as usual. I'm not going! That damned Jew... It was your favorite restaurant! I'm through helping that Jew get rich. What's he done to you? Insured his new car with someone else! When his old car burned your company reneged! I'd change, too. - He set fire to it himself! - Got any proof? He'd been trying to sell it for a year! That isn't proof? Well, I reserved a table. Then you can cancel it. Now? What will he say? Cancel it! Tell him that... my car caught fire. It's unforgivable, this late! What do we do now? Whatever you want. How about Caen? We could go to Caen. Not in this weather. I washed the car this morning. We could eat dinner here! Like a couple of love-birds... Just the two of us. I even reserved a table facing the sea. We always eat "facing the sea". I'll never reserve at Simon's again. Stop talking about that damned Jew. You don't like Jews? I don't like Jews that don't like me... Nuance! You don't love me. You don't love me. Why is that? Ten long years... You just said they weren't long. I meant D-Day... Nuance! Can't you stop saying "Nuance"? It's cold. A ten-year slide from loving to loveless... from caring to careless... from hope to hopeless. On floor polishers. Visit a dentist! You don't visit dentists, you see them. You visit a whorehouse... you see a dentist. Nuance! Is that all? Don't you ever feel like surprising me? Maybe write me a note? Don't bug me about writing you... We're always together! You used to take my picture. You used to know how to smile. Why waste film on that sour face? Our marriage needs to take sick-leave. What does that mean? That our marriage is like being sick. You want to leave? May l ask with whom? You think it has to be with someone. I don't know what you mean. Does Miss Martin still work for you? Get off my back about Miss Martin! She has no husband to support her. So you support me, do you? I say you're destroying me... Nuance! Well...who's closer? The timer! No...we were going out. To celebrate our porcelain anniversary. That's what it's called, isn't it? I'll get him... My mother wants to talk to you. - What does she want now? Money? - It's for our anniversary. I'll get her back... I tell you everything's fine. Three minutes...it's time to hang up. See you soon. Why did she get a phone? Never has anything to say. Why don't you like her? Nuance! She doesn't like me. Aren't you drinking a lot today? Hell, it's the anniversary of D-Day. Of D-Day! Of D-Day. Why didn't you give me flowers? Why didn't you give me any flowers? I gave you flowers last week. When I was in the hospital. Go to the hospital more often. Cheer up! Listen... "Domestic Tragedy in Paris..." "Man stabs wife, then kills self". I'm talking to you! Like talking to the wall... "In Dijon..." They have indigestion. Get it? In-Dij-esti-on! In Dijon, a butcher slaughtered his wife... carved her into pieces... then shot himself in the head. Talk about guts! "In a Paris suburb..." "father of four wounds his mistress fatally..." "fracturing her skull with a bottle." Any other news? "Bidault and Molotov hold talks..." Are you interested? You poor creep! They're all crooks... You're a real bastard! Bitch! Like it, bitch? You're a real bastard. Janine-the-bitch. You're a real bastard. We could go away for the week-end. And be a statistic by Monday night? Indochina is safer! We could buy a TV sot. Always something... You want to be like those other slobs staring at the boob-tube and turning into...zombies. Want to know what TV is? It's a brain-washing machine. That's what it is. Some programs must be worth watching. We'd never go out any more. TV is a way of getting to Paris. And what's happening in Paris? Bottle-murders... Creep! And what about Albert? As it is, he listens to the radio all day. On Saturdays, you go to a bar to watch soccer. Rugby... Nuance! Soccer is feet...rugby is hands. Or do you see Miss Martin? You really make me laugh. You know you're funny? Very funny! The image kills the imagination. It's a choice: image, or imagination? A choice between radio and TV. And we've got a radio... As long as I live, we won't have TV. Excuse my language, but...shit! Excuse mine but I'm fed up, too. Shit! What did she break this time? Did you fall? I slipped on the floor polishers. And no more floor polishers! Damn that mania of yours... The floor's a skating rink! You need cleats to get across... or a pick-axe. I tore my dress. - Did You hurt yourself? - Yes I did. Now you can go back to the hospital. - Can't you be nice for once? - I'm always nice. - Say we still like each other. - we still like each other. It's been six months... Six months... with no fun-and-games. I'll turn off the radio. It was broken anyway. Did you get hurt, Mommy? My dress got hurt worse. Good thing the soup was cold. Let's not be mad any more. I got mad at the grocery lady today. Want me to lose the election next month? We've fought with the baker's wife... the plumber and Simon. She insinuated that you... weren't a real Resistance hero. Where was I on D-Day? At a spa in Vichy? She said you only opened the door because the Resistance fighters... pulled a gun on you. What a bitch! So that's what she says, is it? Supermarkets will finish her kind. - I hope You defended me? - Naturally. Still, they did break in... kind of brutally. Are you challenging my medal, too? Just opening a door can make you a hero! What if I'd opened it to the Germans? Right now, I'd be a hero... I mean a traitor! Or a martyr. And you... they'd have shaved your head. With a swastika on top. Paraded you through town, naked! That bitch! Her and her black-market deals. Don't start anything, okay? I could, but I prefer not to. Calm down. You know how she is. We've got other things to do. After 6 months, you can wait 5 minutes. Like me? You wearing an orthopedic truss? It's a girdle! It still looks orthopedic. That grocery lady is bad news. Talk like that can ruin a career. Nobody would insure with me. Then we'd have to go to Paris. Hide in Paris and die in Paris. Oh, yes! As you've promised for 10 years. Did you invent that story? Just when I'm to be named Deputy-Mayor? Paris? When I can be Mayor here? You've waited 6 months... you can wait 6 mores! I always wanted to go to Paris. And I always hated this house! I'm established here... loyal customers. I have respect and esteem here. And a blockhouse! You were almost a hero. Your customers! What about me? Don't forget you live off them! What a life! Spent with tourists and old soldiers! That blockhouse is in this room! If you're bored to death, go to work. You are boring me to death! I'm still young, Henri. Only thirty! I want to go out, to a restaurant... even a Jewish restaurant! And see beaches that aren't historic. I'm a woman and I'm alive. I want to dance, travel, see things. I took you to Switzerland. To have an abortion! I want a divorce! Here we go again, like in '52. In '52, you cheated on me. All right, I made a mistake. Not by yourself. Here we go with Miss Martin again. Will you drop it? Know what you were like at 20? A hero, a conqueror...a man. Look at what you've become. An assembly-line husband... average...mediocre...petty. Mr Frenchman! Petty schemes, petty vices. And petty habits! Even your illnesses are petty. A toothache, corns, the flu... ear aches...lumbago! You'd rather I had cancer or TB, wouldn't you? Shall I jump out of a window for you... and be a hero? You make me laugh! Get to bed and stop talking crap. Suicide! You can't even walk out on me. What about you? Look in a mirror. Your beauty spots have become cysts. - Albert is ten, we can explain it. - Hell, he's heard it all! - Then let's divorce! - That's it, let's divorce. I mean for real! You get upstairs! Go sleep in the bed! Get upstairs, I said! Janine, you see that gun? It's never been used! Son-of-a-bitch! Coward! Same to you! Miss Martin? Mom, have you seen my scarf? It's upstairs, on the bed. Open the window up there, please. At dawn on June 6, 1944... history was written on these Normandy beaches. History written by we French... Americans, English, Canadians, Dutch. We wrote it in fire and blood. We destroyed the German war machine... eliminated the Nazi tyranny... opp...oppressing Europe... and ensured our own security in a free world.

And now for a glass of good cheer... offered by General Tremblay Your son's a real clown. And I paid for the motorcycle! Your son's a real clown. Good evening. It is June 6, 1964... twenty years since D-Day 1944... when history was written on the Normandy beaches. History written by the French, American... British, Canadians, Belgian and Dutch. It was written in fire and blood. They destroyed the German war machine. Together, they eliminated Nazi tyranny. Together, they ensured our security in a free world. Twenty years ago today... the tide had turned. It was the greatest landing of all time. The free men of the whole word... were marching toward victory. In 11 military cemeteries... are buried 25,000 American... British and Canadian soldiers. Silent crowds today honored their dead. Now other headlines in the news... J-P Sartre may refuse the Nobel Prize. Nikita Krushchev may be replaced. Jack Ruby goes on trial tomorrow. He is the man you saw on TV... in November 1963... shooting Lee Oswald, presumed assassin... of President Kennedy. Queen Elizabeth has made the Beatles... members of the Order of Empire (OBE). The Chinese have the atomic bomb. In France, first tests... for a second TV channel. In a few years we may yet have... two, three or even more channels. General De Gaulle is recovering... from his operation. Now, tonight's special feature: "The Die Is Cast," a documentary of D-Day landings in Normandy. Afterward... survivors of that day will be interviewed. A fleet of hope crosses the Channel. The 4,266 vessels had been preceded... by minesweepers clearing a path. A passage was opened up... through the mined waters. Near the coast, cannon opened fire. On the beaches... mines and barbed wire. A deadly shield between the sea... and the occupied land. The landing craft approached. Amphibious tanks and vehicles bobbed toward the beaches. German blockhouses were on alert. In occupied countries, the landings meant hope and freedom. For these soldiers... fear and danger. Along an 80 mile, 5-sector front... allied soldiers landed. The battle for the beaches began. Pointe du Hoc called for special daring. American Rangers took it. After 48 hours of fighting... the German resistance broke. He'll be right here. It's late to be calling. No airport here as long as I'm Mayor! We'll discuss it tomorrow. At dawn on June 6, 1944... history was written... on these Normandy beaches We wrote that history, we French... Americans, British, Canadians, Belgians and Dutch... We wrote it in fire and blood. Together, we destroyed... the German war machine... eliminated the Nazi tyranny... oppressing Europe... and ensured our own security in a free world. At dawn on June 6, 1944... the tide had turned... FOR SALE ENTER BY SIDE DOOR This is the kitchen? But...there are no windows. A cool kitchen keeps food better, Miss. - Miss, or Mrs? - Mrs... Excuse me...you're so young. And now the dining room? A horseshoe! - It's a bit frightening. - It scared me. Very pretty. Yeah, terrific. - Isn't it a little damp? - Not at all. A little dampness never killed anyone. Just touch up the paint... That should take care of it. What about heat? Is there a radiator? The cold never bothered us. Leaving the kitchen door open heated the whole house. Well, it's certainly economical. What are all these? My husband's war trophies. His pride and joy. But if you take the house... they can be removed. Wouldn't bother me at all... That's very good! Who's the artist? It's Granico...I always forget. They were a wedding present. Pretty, huh..? He's nice, too. Looks very pleasant... It's hardly recent. You weren't even born yet. Happy memories for you... Care to see the view? It's lovely, you'll see. The sea's that way? I got turned around... We came in the side door. Through the garage. They're not too noisy? It only happens once a year, Miss... You seem so young to be married. It's the anniversary of D-Day. Each year there's music, and the Mayor... They landed right here? This house is an historic monument. And the house didn't get hit? That was lucky! There was the Resistance... To defend you, sure. This house brings luck. We lived here happily for 30 years. But now the stairs are to much for me. That's my son's room. Cute, huh? I like kids' rooms... A teddy-bear! - How old is he? - He's thirty. Isn't there a bath? The rooms all have running water. It's summer...not enough pressure. Follow me... I'll show you the master bedroom. It's the loveliest room. - Isn't it a little damp? - Oh, no... Very nice! It's kind of...unexpected. The bed's very pretty. It all sort of goes together. And you have running water... Not enough pressure. Because it's summer. The view must be better from up here. I'll show you. You just have to plane it down. My husband always opened it. I never got the knack. You just have to have the knack... Isn't my little beach lovely? I will now ask you... to observe a minute of silence... in honor of our fallen heroes... and of General Tremblay. The minute is over. In the past, General Tremblay... offered us the "glass of good cheer". The General died last March 15th. This year, his widow... Mrs Tremblay, and her daughter... wish to continue the tradition. They have flown her from the USA. Good evening. It is June 6, 1974... thirty years since D-Day 1944... when history was written on the Normandy beaches. Written by the French, Americans, British, Canadians, Belgians, Dutch. It was written in fire and blood. They destroyed the German war machine. They eliminated the Nazi tyranny... oppressing Europe. They ensured our security in a free world. On June 6, 1944, the tide... had turned. The greatest landing of all time began. The free men of the whole world... were marching toward victory. Immediately after the news, the movie... THE LONGEST DAY will be shown. Afterwards, survivors of D-Day... will take part in a discussion. Turning to today's news... here are the headlines... Giscard d'Estaing, President of France... settles into office. The fuel crisis continues to grow. If there is to be rationing... Hello, darling...are you all right? No, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, I'm used to it. Tonight? I'll watch TV... then go to bed early. Don't bother coming by. But you're coming for lunch tomorrow? Be careful on your motorcycle. It's three minutes, here's a kiss. See you tomorrow. And now THE LONGEST DAY... The French speak to the French. News Bulletin Number Eight. First here are... some personal messages: "I'm looking over a four-leaf clover..." Why? To help you with the window. Where were you? At the hotel across the way. For a whole month? For a whole month. - Alone? - Alone. Here...it's a sleeping pill. It's great... You go right to sleep. Restaurant food is really bad! Maybe you shouldn't have come back. Remember what you said on our wedding night? "The best years of our lives "are those we haven't lived yet" You said that. "The best years of our lives are those "we haven't lived yet" You said that. Do you remember? Adaptation by Harold Brav Subtitling by TVS-TITRA FILMM
