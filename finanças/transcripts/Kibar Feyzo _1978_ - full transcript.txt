I'm talking to you, son. Me, Your Honor? My name is Feyzo. Called "Polite Feyzo" at my village. This life ruined us. But we know its reason. Everything is because of poverty, Your Honor. We learnt it too late. Back at the village... ...if we find even the littlest morsel to eat, we get horny. We start looking for women. But no one can save up for the dowry to get a wife. I did my military service as a gendarme at the Thrace border, Your Honor. - Yo, Bilo! - Feyzo! I see you were corporal! I wanted to beef up our village's reputation. Where did you serve? Thrace border. You? Iranian border. Thank God it's over. Thank God it's over. - Where is Maho Agha? - Upstairs. Hey, wait! Let me inform him. We'd like to thank the ANTAKYA folk dancing team for their help. Maho Agha! Is that you? Your servant Feyzo is finally discharged, Maho Agha! Let me kiss your hand agha! Polite Feyzo! Come here! We really felt your absence this year! A little present, agha! What's this? It's called a "fan", agha! Like this. Gimme. You'll make me polite too, you rascal. Why are you squirming there like a constipated donkey? I wanna marry, agha! With whom? I'm in love, agha! Go to your doom then! Thanks, agha! You're still on my ass? Bilo! For you, agha. What's that? Iranian tea, agha. Leave it there. Agha, I... You're breathing out of your ass, what's it? I want your permission to marry, agha. They don't give them free. Do you have the dowry? I was gendarme at the border, agha. Whom do you want? Gülo, daughter of Hacı Hüso. Feyzo! Mom! Mom.. Gülo.. Bilo.. I'm gone! Feyzo! Dear me... Bilo, where to? Something stinks here! Isn't this Feyzo? Yeah. Seems he deserted! Welcome Feyzo! Thanks. Come, have a tea. I will! Welcome Bilo! Come, rest. I will! Where are they running to? Mother Sekine is running too! Where to, Mother Sekine? To shit! Bilo will shoot Feyzo. Then she will kill Bilo! Then I'll kill you too, you evil-tongued bastard! He must've gone to Hüso's shop! Gülo! Feyzo! You rascal! What's your rush, Mother Sekine? These two scoundrels got horny in the military! Who knows what they're up to! #A military march# Gülo! No, her mother... Let me kiss, ma. Stop, my child! Where is Gülo? To laundry, near the river. Thanks, ma. I'll get these later. - River? - Yes. Welcome, Bilo! Where's your father? Corporal, huh? Where's your father? Discharged, huh? Yep. Where's your father? What's it to you! I'll ask for your sister's hand, Zülfo! Got the money? Yep. Run along then! He's going to Hasaptar! Hasaptar! Run, please! If he sells Gülo, he'll then let me marry! I'm leaving these. We got the car ready, We risk getting sued, If we had those girls, We wouldn't mind 1500. Where is here, where is here, Here is the river of brides, We are in heat too but, Our fathers will kill us! Hazel... 15,000. Cano... 17,500. Gülo! Feyzo? You'll drown Feyzo! I saved up Gülo! Father! Go, tell him! I'm asking... Fuck off!! I ask for Gülo's hand... I was first! Money talks! Whoa you boors! Stop tussling! I've not given Gülo to anyone. You're making up things among yourselves. Send your elders, then we'll talk. Stop, Feyzo! Ma! To hell your ma! You rascal! I'll never buy that pig's daughter for you! Good! I won't! That's my ear, ma! To hell your ear! I'll buy an ox with the money! Look at Gülo, ma! Stop it! Like I want your buttwipe son. You witch! Ox. It's all she says. With that ox, we'll plow Maho Agha's land. And of the harvest, our share is 1, while his is 3. But if we buy Gülo, she's all ours! You can plow her all your life. Drought, flood don't matter. Bears fruit every 9 months. Meaning, we own both the land and the harvest. But tell it to my mother. It's all about ox. You know the tale of Layla and Majnun, Your Honor? I wanted to be a Majnun. So that my mother takes pity on me and buys me Gülo. That day we were supposed to buy the ox with my mother. Don't hide Feyzo. I'll buy that ox! Gülo? My love? Don't mind my stone-hearted mother! I'll kidnap you! Now I'll crush your head with this rock, you whore Gülo! Seducing my son, huh! I love your eyes my Gülo! Chewing gum, Gülo? Ooh, I can't hold myself. I'll kiss that mouth! I'll kill even the male flies around you! He lost it! What'll I do! My son lost it! Blind love! The only solution is to take him to Cripple Hodja! He'll fix him with prayers. (Starting ablution) Hodja! My mom is coming to you. What's her problem? Only you can save me. Why'd you do that for! Shut up in ablution! It's sin, you ass! She's coming for a cure for me. I'm in blind love! You don't look like it. I'll pay 100. Just convince my mother to buy Gülo for me. I want 200. And a hen. A fat hen. Where'd I find it!! Let's agree on 150. And a chicken, then. Deal. Dear me... Hen, chicken, 200.... This Feyzo is up to something. Pray hard Hodja. Cool him off that Gülo! Otherwise our household will be in tatters! Stop puffing to my face Gülo! It makes me feel funny! It's not Gülo! He's Hodja! Your sweet voice, Gülo! Like a bird! I'm your ma, Feyzo! Quick, Hodja! He'll hump me thinking I'm Gülo! I like your tussling, Gülo! Let me go! You just give 150 and thinking of doing me? Fuck off! Ok, now. Son! Leave poor Hodja! Oh, woe to me! He's mad! He is! I'll never buy that bitch. Can't you pray harder? What're you saying Sekine! If we wait even for a little, he'll pray us good! He's in blind love, this fool. You'll buy her, no other choice. On my dead body! Let him die! Feyzo, have some tea! Thanks, Gülo! Salam aleikum! Alaikum salam, Gülo! Hey! Excuse him! He's gone mad! Thinks everyone is Gülo! Feyzo? Yes, Gülo? Don't open your rosy mouth. It's bad luck, my Gülo! I fear he'd throw himself off the mosque! You come to wash laundry all swaying You keep driving us all mad You fall for a madman like Feyzo You girls want us to be in blind love, too? Boys, stop behaving with attitude And talking about Feyzo's affairs. If you can, then stop running after us Those who don't know love can't get us Tell me again, what's that he's doing? Gone mad. He thinks everyone is you. This is Feyzo! Poor guy! Go on lookout! Climb down and let's talk Feyzo! Let me get a ladder. I'm a love bird! Looking for my love! Ain't I your love, you ass! I don't think so, sugar. My love should chirp like me! Here, I am the one you love! I am your Gülo! No one is mad for me. Father and brother coming! Father's coming! Fly off! She's completely nuts! Thinking she's a bird. What're you doing up there? I'm a love bird! You fucker! I'll show you what a love bird is! Fly down! Or I'll make you fly! He really flies, pa! (call to prayer) I told you he'd jump off the mosque! Shut your grim mouth! (singing) Feyzo, son! Gülo! It's all your fault! Is an ox more important than your son? Stop being stubborn! He's gonna jump! Just pretending. He has no intention of jumping. Shut it, you ass! Get down, son! Apple of my eye! Please! I'm begging you, son! Get down! You deserve every girl in the village! I consent! What if you renege? She will! Just jump, Feyzo! This is my father-in-law! How trickster he is! He invited both me and Bilo on the same day... ...for asking for marriage, so he'd get a higher dowry! You are disrespecting our traditions! Calling two sides at the same day! Muslims have no secrets, Sekine woman! Offer what you got! Let's not fall into this sinner's trick! He wants to rise the price by pitting us against each other! I'm just having a democratic meeting, Sekine woman! So, let's talk! What if Bilo pays more! Shut it! Gülo, Ayşe! That's inappropriate! I'll never marry that mangy Bilo! Since when girls choose the groom! You'll marry whom your father approves! He approves money. He is selling me to the highest bidder. These traditions... As long as they stay, how can lovers unite? They can't, ma! So, I'll run away! Shut it! Attagirl, Ayşe! Both sides only have cash. 5,000! Damn you, Feyzo! 5,500! 6,000 now! I won't go for that cheap! Bilo! It's 6,500! - Say 7,000! - 7,000! Feyzo, it's 7,000! I know. 7,500! If it reaches 10,000 my father will buy me a girl! Down with this rotten system! Down with this agha order! Let them all go away So we can have the girls What to do with this system Better kick it down the stairs While it goes tumbling down We shall start dancing after it 8,000. If only dad accepts it. 9,000. My cruel father won't hear it. 9,500 now! - Say 10,000! - Get away! 9,550! 9,750! Not a penny less than 10,000. I hope you see your daughter rot! With price like this, no one can marry anymore! He's right! Guys surely soon riot! And this sinner will have a feast! Let's go! Father insists on 10,000! I accept, Gülo! Your ma doesn't! You greedy asshole! The hell with your daughter! Where's Gülo? The hell with it! Her father talks out of his ass. He now wants 20,000 for the slut! Let's go Bilo. He now wants 20,000. You crook. It seems I'll be single this year too. 9,000 cash plus 5,000 note, 14,000 total! Accept! Door is going! Get out! 10,000 cash, 10,000 note! Good, Feyzo! Accept, father! Agreed? Are you mad? Come here! Notes will be paid in 5 months, ok? Falling! You'll destroy our home! I said ok? Ok, ok! So you give Gülo? I do, enjoy it! Woe to me! Gülo is gone! We are done for good! How can you find all that money, you ass! "Scrivener" 10,000 cash. Remaining 10,000 will be paid in 5 installments in 6 months. If you don't pay on time, I'll take the girl back! Until the debt is clear, the good's ownership is father's... ...while the right to use belongs to husband. I'll use the good! Take these to Maho Agha, have them stamped! Why? You are poor. Nothing for insurance. Unless Maho Agha vouches, no Gülo for you. What's this! What's the hurry? Agha... You are our owner. Only God owns. What's eating you? Hüso says he won't give Gülo unless you vouch for me. I feed you, and now I also have to put the woman in your bed? I'll be the sole under your shoe Agha! I have to have Gülo. Aghas have to give. That's all we do. But we can't get anything back. How will you pay without stealing from me? By working, thanks to you Agha. If you can't pay, I'll take your wife! So funny. We are all your serfs, Agha! Honor the wedding! Welcome Agha! Step on me Agha! Hold tight, rascal! Stop moving! You honor us! Where's that dog! There, Agha! With the fedora! You know better Agha, but, do serfs imitate Aghas? Doesn't this disturb your order? Welcome, Maho Agha! What's this? Fedora, Maho Agha! And this? It's fedora too! But a little worn out, Agha. Worn out, huh! You dog! Don't tire yourself, Agha. I'll stomp. When did I allow my serfs to put on a fedora like me? Asshole! Forgive me, Agha! Leave this village! Until you pull yourself together, you are exiled! But Agha... wedding night... Please, can't I leave tomorrow? Are you still here, you dog! Why oh why, my Polite Feyzo! I have a fedora, that's why! Then you have the fedora And we have the wedding night Who did I think I was? An agha? I am a poor serf. What's I got to do with a fedora! But Maho Agha was wrong too! It was my wedding day! I couldn't taste my Gülo! Only aghas wear it, huh? Everyone in the city wear that shit! What's this now.. Come here! I said come! Quick! Let's finish this! But Gülo! Maho Agha! Is your zipper his any business? Lay down! It's tangled. I'll open it. Whoa! Stop playing, you hussy! - Gülo! - Gülo will die for you! He ran that way! Pa! You said that when you got the money... ...you'll get me married. Now, let's go and take the girl! You ass! Instead of yourself, think of your sister! What if he deflowers her! But she's married! Feyzo is his husband. Without wedding night, no! And if he can't pay... ...I'll sell her to someone else, if she is still pure! They're there! They're there! Come! They're coming Gülo! Let them! Stop, girl! Bastard Bilo will shoot us both! There! I saw them! Let's get him before he screws her! Gülo! Resist my daughter! Don't tell your father that we did it! Ok. I couldn't get enough. Me too. You bear! Bastard Bilo! I said to myself 'Now I'm on the road, let's go to İstanbul." Because if couldn't find money, this sinner Hüso will resell Gülo. I was sure of it. And the buyer was waiting. Scumbag Bilo. This is the worker market. Well, the animals in our animal market... ...are treated with much more respect than here. You! Me? You! Me! You! Me? Go back you boor! Boor is your father, dog! I started as a porter. But it was hard to serve people in the city. Nature was calling. Stop you boor! There is a loo there! Go! This is not wilderness! Be civilized! Look! Go! Cologne? Thanks. Whoa, money! What money? You blind? Illiterate? Number 1, 50 Number 2, 100. It isn't free even to urinate in İstanbul, huh? I was working at anything. Days pass, payment day closes in. And humanity has no mercy anymore, Your Honor! 300. 300. 100. This is all? Yep. Why is it less than others? They are from Union. I'm from Harran! Get out, smartass! Boss has to be from Union, too. He looks after his townsmen. I got a letter in those days from the village. Agha had asked me to return. I knew that he was worried about the payment he vouched for. I thought of Gülo and having a comfortable wedding night. Feyzo, my son! Returned huh? Where's Gülo, ma? Inside. Curse her. You stroll a little, ma. You heat some water, come on. You boor! Let's go before he deflowers her. Otherwise she's worth zilch. If he pays, you'll get me married. You promised! Come Gülo. I'm in heat! We both are! Here. Come on! Be gentle, girl! Open up Feyzo, or I'll break it down! It's pa's voice! He's always on time. Open up, Feyzo. Or else! What's the rush, pa! Come in. Just the 3 of you? I was expecting the whole village. Did he do anything? He couldn't. It's pay day. If you don't I'll take Güle away. Money's ready. Here's in my pocket. Where's my pocket? Here my love. Thanks Gülo. Please. 500, 1000... It's a sin to pay this much for a wench! You'll get me married, right? 1970,25 lira. Ok? Not a penny less 2000! Take a look at the jacket! Mom. You have any? For this wench? I have a little. 1974,75! I have 0,25 in my allowance. You ass! Whose money you're giving now! No allowance next week! If he pays, you will get me married, pa! I'll pay the rest next week. Nope. Let's go! Pa, please! I said go! You minx! Please, I'll pay! Don't take Gülo away! You have one day. Otherwise I'll go to agha! Why don't you rescue me! Yes, rescue you. I rescued. Point the gun! Bilo is ready with the money! I'll get you married immediately! Hands up, Feyzo. Or else! Go, you! I'll never marry that mangy Bilo! We'll buy an ox with that money! Ox, you ass! Ox, I say! Let me go already! Poor Feyzo couldn't pay it seems. Let me! You still want her? Yes, yes! Is she still pure? Pure as maiden. Feyzo has one day to pay. Otherwise Gülo is yours. 9000 cash? Yes! I know this rascal will sell Gülo. Then I remembered the city. Yoo know, that loo incident. What's this? Don't you see? What's inside? Go in. Money first. Number 1, 50 Number 2, 25. Very funny, you ass! Bugger off! Go in and take a good look! First sale is from you, abundance is from the shit. What's inside? A round hole like this! In it? Shit! Fuck off! Here! To wash the ass! He's up to something! All the village's shit will be piled on here. Shit will swallow up our village! I know this from the military. Public toilet. But in a village? Good luck Feyzo! Thanks Mehmet! Let me try it. Here. You, too? Here. No rush. Line up here. No rush! No fight! You'll all take your shit. He built a loo, agha. Everyone's shitting. And he charges everyone like a customs officer. Get my horse ready! Whoa! Hurry up! People waiting! 1999.50! Just 0.50 left, Hüso! Then no-one can take Gülo away from me! Get in line! Here, here. No rush! Pay up! Pay up? I'm your father-in-law! And how good you are! Cough up the 50p! It was No. 2! Everyone heard your ass sounding like a trumpet! Look! Here! Your money is ready! You got the bill? Yup. Count it and give me the bill. He paid it. Now you'll get me married, pa! Here comes agha! Free of charge for Agha Welcome, agha! We serfs were waiting for you! What's this? What's it for? It's a loo, agha! Who'll shit? The ones who pay. Only free for our agha! Go on. It's free for you, agha! Free, huh? You lost all your marbles! So, I'll go and take a shit, and then you go and shit on my shit, huh? Are you mocking me? Can there be a higher shit than agha's shit!! How's it possible? You're crapping on our traditions! Destroy it. Bilo, stop! Now, Feyzo, leave my village! Agha, please! Mercy! I'll never interfere with other's shit again. Forgive me! You're exiled! Leave my land at once! Shithead. What now? Don't worry. He can't pay up the next one. Will you get me married, pa! You better get my big brother married. Don't wait for me. I'm 6 months pregnant! What're you saying? When did you lie under him, whore! Wedding day, at roadside. I'm married to him, right? True. I told you! You prick! Running after a pregnant woman, eh? This rascal told me she was pure! Fuck off! Little dog! Come here! Whoa, his head split. Let's go. Stop! I paid up! I've the right to use! You are exiled! You have to leave! Then she'll help ma instead of you! He paid up, pa! Now will you get me married? You horny dog! Things go wrong because of you! Why oh why, my Polite Feyzo! I'm polite, that's why! Let's build you a loo And throw the agha in it "No shit on his shit!" Son of a shit. So what if he's an agha? He doesn't know politeness. Nor civilization. Why don't we rebel? We are born serfs, Your Honor. And forgot to demand our rights. I'm married for 6 months, but slept with Gülo only once! With thorns in my ass. Still, couldn't get enough of it, Your Honor. I'd been working for 6 months in the city, missing Gülo so much. Feyzo, you have mail. My son is 2 months old now. Agha has forgiven me. He is a little uncivilised, brutal, and leaves us hungry but... ...our Maho Agha is one of a kind. And he was worried about the payment he vouched for, asshole. Welcome back, Feyzo! I missed you so much, Gülo. Let me taste you. You lay the bed, heat the water. He looks just like me! Look at the head! If only it was a girl. Why? How will he find the dowry? He'll stay single, like my brother. If it were a girl, we could sell her. Maybe this time it'll be a girl. If you have a sister, we'll trade for weddings. Come! What now? Let him cry. Let me, my love. Wait. I have a wonderful voice. He'll fall asleep with my single lullaby. Sleep you little donkey I'll screw your ma, bed is ready You only keep suckling and crying Except those you know nothing Go to sleep now you rascal Let us do our own thing I told you I'm the best at lullabies. Look at his beauty. Just like me! Come on! Be a little polite! Gülo! Open up, damn you! I'm dead tired! Mother's here. I'll shit on her mouth. Feyzo, you're back! Yes, ma! So you are tired? Sleep then! Prepare her bed! Gülo, heat the soup. I'm hungry. You are tired, ma! You better sleep! I'm hungry! She's asleep? Yep. Ma's awake, Feyzo! Why are you awake, ma? I'm not sleepy! Let me sing a lullaby, ma! You know my voice. I'll put her to sleep now. Lay down. Why you do this to me Ma, you better go to sleep I so much long for my sweet Let me taste her as I please Sleep's come to greet now I'm dozing off, ma You've screwed up everything I'll shit on your mouth, ma You go ahead, ma. I'll get the cow and catch up. I'm not planning anything. Gülo! Heat the water, quick! You slept on that witch's lap yesterday. Come here, I'm out of patience! Who's it? It's me! Open up! It's pay day! I'm losing it!! Wait, you sassy. Easy to say! We did it once a year! What you want so early?? Did I disturb you, Polite Feyzo? It's pay day. Money or Gülo! Here, 1500. 500 later, with mortgage. You have nothing. What will you mortgage? There's a cow in the barn. How much it'll worth? 500. Good. Give me the bill. Go see if there is really a cow. Cow's there, pa! Enjoy! And you enjoy or not! Don't' say that cause... Asshole... Let's take it and go. Pa! Let's sell it and buy me a girl, huh? Wow, you are naked! Yes. Bare naked! Much comfortable like this! Gülo? Gülo dies for you! Stop teasing, wench! No! Let me! I'm horny as hell! I said no! Why? What did I do? You badmouthed me when pa came! I didn't. You called me sassy. I didn't. You did! Yes, I did!! Go! You ox! Stop rushing, ma! Or else! You are your mother's son And your wife's cotton mattress And now a donkey on the plow Oh, Feyzo, what did you do! I'm at the mercy of two women! But mostly at my mother's, at my mother's! Please, good sirs. Nothing like Ankara (capital), huh, sir? It's we that's toiling away here. Sir, we have 6 villages. I provide whatever they need. Dowries, weddings, plows, oxen... To cut it short, I suffer, they live like kings. If we solve this water problem, we'll be happy too. Now, sir... Source is up there... What's this disgrace!! What's it, sir? A human on plow, this day and age! You said, you provided everything? What's this then? I had no idea! Agha, that ass is doing this on purpose! Go and check! Feyzo! Maho Agha is calling! Stop, ma! Agha's here! Return fast! We have another field. You ox! What're you doing! Fuck off! Welcome agha! Feyzo, what're you doing on a plow, son? Hüso took my ox, Maho agha! Why did he? I couldn't pay the dowry, sir. You said you pay the dowries? You have any land? Serfs having land, sir?? We only cultivate Maho Agha's land. The pay? No pay. Our agha feeds us. You are fed well? Long live my agha. If we can find to eat anything, it's all up to him! Come here! Damn you! I ask about my serfs, you say "good, good". Look at poor Feyzo! Why don't you tell me, son! Go get two oxen from my house. Two oxen. Two oxen? What's your debt, son? 6,000. Give 6,000 to Feyzo. 6,000. To me, agha? Agha's mocking me... No mocking, now. Agha's sunstruck! Enough, go now. Long live, agha! There's no agha like you! I'm gonna f.... It hurts! You bite the hand that feeds you, huh? It hurts! You piss on my livelihood, huh! You discredit me, huh? Agha, stop! You're banished! Get the fuck off my land! Untie me then.. May you be blind, you ungrateful dogs! I feed you all! I get you your women. I give you plows, ox. You pricks! You are 141-142 people here. I feed you all! Behave or I'll sell this village! You think the new agha will buy you anything? You'll all starve! It's all his fault, agha! You scoundrel! Fuck off! Agha, don't! Let this be a lesson for you all! You all behave now! I plowed the earth, nothing grows I've even become an ox, it's not enough! There is agha between us, Gülo! I cannot go and touch my love! Agha like you that I... And your bloodline... Who made this asshole an agha! Who gave him this land! Asshole! What can we do, your Honor? Desperate, submissive... This is the order. I wonder if this order ever gets changed. The saying goes, "Agha is always right." I don't remember a right thing he's ever done. Our fate is between his two lips. And that's the problem. This time I stayed quite long in the city, Your Honor. I heard I had a baby girl. I saw extraordinary things. İstanbul is a wonder. I learnt so many things. Like unions. Here, there are "city aghas". But serfs here unite when they think the pay is low... ...and get their rightful due. Strike. Bread. Freedom. Workers are brothers, employers are traitors. Fascism. What's that mean? Do you know what fascist means, Your Honor? Our Maho is one. I break wood. - Look here. - Wood? - No. - Ok. Wait. For how much do you paint this wall? - 20 lira. - Ok. "Down with the aghas order." No passage to fascism I paint over graffiti. Look here. How much for it? 30 lira. Ok. General strike is our right, we'll get it no matter what! Down with the fascist nests! Freedom - Congrats. -Thanks. - How much did you pay? - For what? - The wife. - Are you crazy? Move away! I was asking the wife's price. She is my daughter, not an object for sale! They agreed and got married. You didn't want any dowry? There is no such thing now. You really got her free? Free, free. Scoundrel Hüso! I learnt that women are not goods for sale. Dowry tradition already ended but we didn't know it. I wanted to tell it to my villagers, but agha had exiled me. This is called camouflage. I'd learnt it in military. If she's here, she'll recognize my chirping. She got it! It's me, don't worry. How did you come? Secretly! I missed you so much. Come in. Meow if someone comes! I'll meow, ok! Whore! Having men now huh? Sister! Feyzo! It was you? Yes, me. Pa better not know. Come now. I've news for you. No. I better go. About to pee. Dowry is no more in the city, you know? What are you saying, Feyzo? It's even illegal now! Really? So you can get the girl you like, for free? We first spread the news secretly in village. That women are not property to sell. Everyone can have who they love. A bride from the city told Feyzo that she is not a property to be sold... ...and she's marrying the guy she loves. She is right. Let's spread the word! A groom said that dowry is over and they just married after falling in love. He is not buying an animal from the market. He is right. Let's go! You can't harvest on steep hills Healing don't come by agha's bills I got the one that I love, my Gülo Whomever interferes will regret this I got harvest on steep hill Feyzo has healing for my thing If you are brave, come to me, my Feyzo I got the thing that you need Here, agha! Mothers and fathers of a daughter Down with the dowry order We are not properties to be sold Dowry tradition will be dissolved Religion is under threat, agha! Girls are in heat! What's this "EKK"? "The Spinster Ones". Both the tradition, and the agha Damn them all, also the dowry money. This order will change I'll be at my home. Men get their maiden Spare the money for oxen The girls are our right We'll get them no matter what! We are women, we are mothers We're against to be treated as plunders Dowry really hurt me bad! I want a woman now! I want an ox. Ox! I repent, agha! I'm all for dowry! It has to be 100,000! Keep hitting! I don't mind dying if I don't have a woman! He can't kill us all, can he!? You better hit now! That stick'll be in our hands one day! We lost the ox, too! You shit face! You coward! We may be poor but aren't we also humans! What are you saying? When we faced with agha, all of us froze in terror! He is mere human, like us. We'd drown him just by spitting. But when he appeared, spits in our mouths dried up. How can we erase our fear of agha, I have no idea. Agha forced Gülo and me to work on his land till I clear my debt. Now I'm not allowed to go to city cause I always bring back trouble. I am not allowed to go near Gülo. That asshole Bilo keeps watch. Looking is forbidden! How can it be forbidden! It is! Agha told so. You looked 3 times today. Unless you pay 3 liras, I'll tell agha. Here's 5. I'll look for 2 liras! I'm off for now. Time's up! Done! Kidnap me Feyzo! Ok. How? Speaking is forbidden! Is shitting forbidden too? No. Then lay down so I can shit on your face. What is this! All of you crying like puppies! I can't take it anymore, ma! Serves you cowards right! Cry. It'll make you feel better. What'll I do, ma! Wait for 15 years for that baby girl to grow... ...so you can sell her. Huh? Look at the eyes, the hair... So beautiful! Who wants her? It'll be a bargain. An easy purchase. She'll be the most beautiful girl in 13-14 years. Like her mother. The daughter of the most beautiful girl in the village. And don't forget also my beauty! Just for 5,000! No one? Ok, 4,000! I don't increase the price like that Hüso! 3,000! 2,000! You'll regret later! Don't bother, Feyzo. No-one will buy this baby. Hey, Zülfo. How about 500? I would but I'm her uncle. I can't marry her. Maybe you can. Hodja! He really can't? No, he can't! You shithead bitch. You are not worth a damn! It was clear that there was no way to find the money to take back Gülo. Agha took my Gülo hostage. But I'm full of ideas. I decided to have myself exiled so I can go to the city for money. I did it, Agha! Now am I exiled? No, you aren't, you ass! Beat him! It hurts, Agha! Exile me rather! Exile me! What's the score? You sat on my hat, you ass! Going somewhere, Agha? You are..- Exiled? No, you aren't, you ass! Run along! What's that? Stop! What're you doing? Are you nuts? The water needs aroma, Agha! Not worthy to you! You, asshole! Am I exiled? No, no, no! It hurts! Damn your ancestors Bilo! Your whole lineage. That stick you hold. What're you writing? Fascist Agha! What does fascist mean? Like an asshole, a queer. Now you are..- Thanks, Agha! ...not exiled, you ass. Mercy, Agha! I came to my senses now. Please, Agha! Mercy! I couldn't succeed in having myself exiled. Agha's stubbornness prevailed and I gave up. Maho Agha had us planted mostly cotton that year. I had heard that cotton workers got 100 lira a day in Çukurova. I'll go and work there, Feyzo! No matter what father says. Then I can get married soon. And I can pay up my debts. Heed my advice: Don't buy a woman in installments! Cotton needs much more care. Watering, plowing, gathering... We'll work and gather it, Agha! Your one eye is always on the lookout for women. How can I trust you? Thanks to you, I cannot see her! Did I tell you to buy her in installments! Cotton workers get 100 lira in Çukurova! Monthly? Daily! You ingrate dogs! Why do I feed you? Agha! Damn your Agha! While I get the 2/3 of the total crop, 1/3 goes to you! You create all the mischief, you dog! We better think of the other life, and build a new mosque. What else you want, ingrates! We have a mosque, but no woman! And no land! Shut it! How can serfs speak against agha!! From tomorrow on, you won't get a break even for prayer! Don't make me mad or I'll sell the village! The hell you do! We lost another hope. I suddenly remembered the workers in the city. Strike. Bread. Freedom. Workers are brothers, employers are traitors. Let's gather, I've something to say. Maho Agha works us for free. Unless we protest, he'll keep doing so! That's what I say. Let's go to Çukurova, and work there! You are right, Feyzo. Maybe I'll get married there. But Maho Agha will sell the village, and we'll all perish there. Shame on you! Instead of languishing here, better perish there, you coward! Think, friends! If we unite, agha can't do shit! Without us, who'll toil, cultivate, huh? What about Gülo? He holds her. I won't leave without her! I'll take her by force! Yeah, we will! Here, Feyzo. Your father's gun. So? It's sanctified to use force against evil! Really? Sanctified? Ok. Out for killing birds, Feyzo? Yeah. Killing you, you crow! Let's go, Gülo. Where to, Feyzo? You had wanted me to kidnap you, right? Agha will kill you this time, Feyzo! I'll kill you! Put it away! Shut up. Turn around. Kneel. Say your last prayers. Tell your asshole agha to sell the village. We're leaving. Why'd you take that old gun? It doesn't work. What? Really it doesn't. What's it now? Feyzo kidnapped Gülo! Why'd you let him! He had a gun. I barely escaped! What're you saying, Bilo? He told you to sell the village. They're leaving. Are you crazy? Who's leaving? The village, agha! How can a village get up and leave? What's the music? Is there a wedding without my knowledge? This is not a wedding, but a war tune! Stop! Where are you going, you ingrate dogs! Turn back! Bring that asshole Feyzo here! Don't go, Feyzo! Farewell, Gülo! You too, ma! Asshole Maho! Leave us in peace! It's enough you bled us dry, dog! Don't go, Feyzo! Ok. Even dogs obey their masters, you weasels! This is the head snake, agha! Leave it! Leave it, so that I can shoot myself! Let him. Feyzo, don't be mad! Shoot yourself! So that I won't have your dirty blood on me. His blood is cleaner than yours, Maho Agha! Who has dirty blood? Yours. Dear Feyzo. Please spare my life. What about yours, Hüso? You owe me nothing, Feyzo! Please don't kill me! Yours is the dirtiest, Maho Agha. Stop joking, you dog. Shoot yourself. No. I'll shoot you. I'll die for you! I shot him, right? And this is the whole story. I didn't tell a single lie. Maho Agha is dead. And a new agha took his place. I heard that everyone now misses Maho Agha. I don't know how this will end. You are the State, you'll know it. You give the final judgement. Who's guilty?
