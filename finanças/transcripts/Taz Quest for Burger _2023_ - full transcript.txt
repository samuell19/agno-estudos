-[theme music playing] -[whooping and laughing] [tribal music playing] [Quinn] Once upon a time, in the heart of wild Australia, deep in the vast and boundless landscape of the Outback, there lived a village of bandicoots! -[lively music playing] -[yawns] -Morning, Sam. -Hey, Bill. [Quinn] These bandicoots worked hard all year gathering food, tuber vegetables, mushrooms, anything the land could provide. And provide it did! When winter came, the land would be empty, but the bandicoots' stockpile would be full. The bandicoots would celebrate with a big feast -before settling in for the long winter. -[upbeat music playing] All their friends were invited! The emus, the wombats, the kangaroos. The koalas only liked to eat eucalyptus leaves, but with the right spices, you can't tell the difference. [squeaks] [squeals] The bandicoots were excellent cooks! The feast was happy and safe, hidden away from carnivores and scavengers and other monsters. Back then, the monsters lived far away, on a mysterious island. Tasmania! And on Tasmania, there was one monster worse than all the others. -[footsteps thudding] -A ravenous beast with long, sharp teeth, -ready to eat anything in its path. -[growls] Or anyone! Luckily for the bandicoot village, the monster stayed on the island. Or so they thought! [creature growls] That fateful night, while the village celebrated their feast, someone else was preparing for a feast of his own! -[growls] -The Tasmanian terror! The Tasmanian monster! The Tasmanian Devil! [snarls] [howls] [growls] Tasmanian Devil! There's no escape! [howls] Your daughter's quite the storyteller there. What's that? Oh! Oh, boy. [nervously] Uh, Quinn! Hey, Quinn! [chuckles] [growls and snarls] Yeah? H-How would you like to learn how to grill? Huh? A little father-daughter bonding? -[growling] -[grunts] Okay, okay. I think this story might be just a little too scary. Don't worry, Dad. A hero comes in and saves the day! [dramatic music playing] -The Lone Buckaroo! -[all groaning] [Stan] Oh, crikey. [Quinn] The Lone Buckaroo! Scourge of the carnivores. Hero of the Outback. [creature growls] [all] Wow! -[all sarcastically] Wow! -[Melanie unimpressed] Eh. [growls] -[all grunting] -Quinn, stop! please! Ugh. Hold on. [dramatic music playing] Ha! [growls] Look out! He's preparing his signature attack. The Tasmanian devil spin! [Aristotle] That's not what the Tasmanian Devil does. Yes, it is! He spins around really, really fast. Yeah, but it's not a somersault. It's a cartwheel. Hey, have you ever seen the Tasmanian Devil? Seen him? Well, no. But my dad knows all about him and-- [all] Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! You've seen the Tasmanian Devil? Oh, man. That's so cool! -How tall is he? -[boy] How short is he? Wait! This is my story! Uh, well, I've never seen the Tasmanian Devil. But I know a guy who knows a guy. [all] Wow! I wish my dad knew guys. Oh, does he cartwheel or somersault? It's more of a tornado kinda deal. -Why did he leave Tasmania? -Nobody knows. Uh, does he eat bandicoots? Well, he eats everything, so it-- How many of us could he fit in his mouth? Like if he really crammed us in there? I don't know. Uh, three, four? [all exclaim] Cool! He's not cool! He's a beast, a monster. Waiting in the darkness to eat you alive. [gasps in fear] He's not gonna eat you. He may be scary, but the Tasmanian Devil hasn't bothered anyone in years. -Which means he's hungry. -[whimpering] No. Tonight's the night. He's coming for ya. Quinn, stop! He's gonna cry. -[whimpering] -Then I better tell him about the hero that will save him. -The Lone Buckaroo! -[crying] Now, where were we? Charlie, I believe you were hiding behind that rock. -[all grumble] -[boy grumbling] The Lone Buckaroo. Oh, hey! Maybe this time, The Lone Buckaroo's friends can help her beat the Tasmanian Devil. That way everyone can play. -[all clamoring excitedly] -[Quinn] What? Huh? Fine. [unenthusiastically] Once upon a time, there was a Tasmanian Devil, and he fought the lone as in a Lone Buckaroo. -[Taz grunts quizzically] -Hi-ya! And her friend, the other Lone Buckaroo. No, there's only one of me. And their friend, Super Bandicoot! [Taz grunts] No super powers! You can only-- [Aristotle howls] [all shouting excitedly] Come on, Quinn. Why don't you join in? The Lone Buckaroo works alone. Even if that means getting eaten. [grunts] -[ominous music playing] -[slurps] [all screaming] [grunts and groans] Whoops! Sorry, Quinn. Let me just fix that for ya. Aw, it's just Ned. I thought it was a real crocodile. Ned's a real crocodile. Yeah, but you know what I mean. Hey, Ned. Just in time for dinner. [grunts] Oh, dinner! [grunts] One bandicoot style eucalyptus leaf for the koala. -Tastes just like real eucalyptus. -[Koala] Mmm! And for the crocodile, my own recipe, bandicoot style veggie burgers. [chuckles] Tastes just like real, uh, [clears throat] bandicoots. [chomping] I thought Ned was the crocodile that didn't eat bandicoots. Oh, no, no, no. He doesn't. [chuckles] Ned doesn't eat meat anymore. But you used to? Yup! That's how we met. I almost ate him. [chuckles] So embarrassing. [nervously] Uh, but... But I told him I knew how to make veggie burgers that taste like meat. So now he eats them instead. They taste better than meat, and I don't even have to hunt. All the other carnivores think I'm crazy. I tell them, hunting is for suckers. Bandicoot village is where it's at. You don't actually tell carnivores to come to our village, do you? Hmm? No! No. I just tell 'em that if they tasted these burgers, they'd never eat meat again. You should make more. [chomps] [chuckles] I wish. But this stockpile needs to last us through the winter. Aw, jeez. I don't want to eat all your food. [chomps and belches] Now why don't you tell me the recipe so I can make my own? No way. No, no. It's too dangerous. More dangerous than hunting? They're vegetables! They're just eggs laid by a tree. Okay, I don't actually know what vegetables are, but I know there's nothing dangerous about tossing 'em on a grill. Yeah, you don't wanna overcook it. Here, let me show you. [humming] Okay, now it gets tricky. [tribal music playing] if you add too much scorpion venom, it's poisonous. But if you add too little, even more poisonous. Don't ask. Overcooking makes it explode. [clears throat] While under-cooking gives it a weird aftertaste. Also melts your stomach. Ah, it took me years to learn, and I'm the only bandicoot that can do it. That's why this year's feast is so special. I'm going to teach Quinn how to cook. [chuckles] Now where is she, anyway? [knocking] [gasping] -Whoops! Sorry. -[whimpers and grunts] Ah, there you are. How'd you like to learn how to grill, huh? Why? So I can bribe Ned to not eat me? It's not a bribe. Ned guards our village every night, and we feed him in return. He's... He's our friend. I'm a vegetarian now. Yeah, now. How many bandicoots did you eat before my dad became your personal chef? [sighs] Uh, why don't you put those aside? I think I'm full. Quinn, where are you're going? To my room! Unless you want to give that to some other kid, too. Hey. Uh, how big is the room? My mom says my energy takes up a lot of space. [groans] Quinn! [somber music playing] [sighs] You weren't very nice to Ned. So? He tried to eat you. Well, he didn't know any better. Ned has protected us for years. Anyone can change if you give them the chance. I wish we didn't need his help. Well, needing help is a good way to make friends. And the village has never been safer. It wasn't always like this. You're too young to remember, but there was a time when we were never safe. A time when I couldn't protect everyone. Now, it's just you and me. I worry about you. I know. Well, that's why I wanted to teach you to cook. Maybe it'll get you out of trouble one day, like it did for me. You know what I always say... [both] "If you can't beat 'em, feed 'em." But I was telling a story, and it was just getting good. Or at least, I thought so. [sighs] The other kids think I'm weird. Yeah, well all kids are weird. That little one over there picks his nose with his tail. Yeah, look, adventure stories are fun, but they aren't going to protect you. I guess. Here. Tomorrow morning, you'll learn how to cook. Now it's bed time. Can't I read some more? Nope, it's too dark. Hey! [giggles] Goodnight, Quinn. Love you. [Quinn's voice echoing] Love you too, Dad. Goodnight. [tribal music playing] [in sing-song voice] Night. [sighs] [snoring] [both scream] -Morning, Quinn! -[panting] Your dad asked me to wake you up extra early. I always wanted to be a rooster. [giggles] [screaming] Dad? Dad? Huh. He's probably getting ingredients from the stockpile. [gasps] Our food! It's gone! Who could have done this? Ned! [grunting] Ned. Huh? Wait a minute. [crying] It wasn't me! It was dingoes! Dingoes? Why didn't you fight them off? You're supposed to protect us. These weren't just any dingoes. It was Rocky's gang! They're vicious! There were so many of them. And one of them was really big, and-- Ned! Why would dingoes take our vegetables? They're carnivores. They must've heard about the veggie burgers. Gee, I wonder how they heard that, Mr. Big Mouth. Why didn't you tell them the recipe takes years of practice, and my dad's the only one who can make them? -I did! -And? They took your dad, too. [shouts] They what? [dramatic music playing] Wait! Come back! -These tracks lead into the ocean. -[panting] But there's nothing in that direction except... [gasps] Tasmania? Exactly. None of us have ever been there, so it's the perfect place to disappear. All of our food gone. And nothing will grow 'til next spring. What happened, Ned? Did you fall asleep? No, he was awake. I heard him crying all night. I was not! I... Okay, maybe I was a little distracted. Quinn hurt my feelings pretty bad. [nervously] What? You're a crocodile! You're supposed to have thick skin. Look, it's not important. Let's just go to Tasmania and get my dad back. Isn't Tasmania kinda dangerous? I heard there's carnivores, and they're even bigger and meaner than the ones we have here. You said it's full of monsters! [all clamoring] [shouts] Enough! I'm the one who let this happen. I'll go. Rocky's gang may be tough, and they may have beaten me up once, and there may be no reason at all to expect I'll succeed, so you know what? I've changed my mind. [clapping] Fine. If none of you are brave enough, I'll get someone meaner than a crocodile who could take on 100 dingoes. The Tasmanian Devil? What? No, no, no. The Lone... Hey, that's not a bad idea. Whoa! Nu-uh! Nope. Time out. The real Tasmanian Devil is different than the one from your stories. Trust me, the guy's a mess. He's out to lunch. And good thing, too, because if he ever came to his senses, he'd probably eat all of us, including me. You used to be a carnivore too, remember? Although without my dad's burgers, maybe you'll go back to eating meat. [ominous music playing] No! No, I'm still vegetarian, see? -[chomping] Ugh. Is mud a vegetable? -No. -What about koalas? -[shouts] No! Okay, just checking. Boy, this is gonna be rough. Your dad didn't leave any burgers behind? Just one. And I'm taking it to the Tasmanian Devil. If you can't beat 'em, feed 'em. Quinn, as your new father, I forbid you from doing this! You're not my dad, and I don't need your help! Just like The Lone Buckaroo. Scourge of the dingoes. Hero of the bandicoots! And the Tasmanian Devil. Eater of dingoes and of crocodiles... And of birds and of rocks! -And bandicoots. -Yeah, can't forget bandicoots. Right. That is, if I can even find where he lives. Oh, I heard he lives in a spooky cave, 11.2 kilometers, 107 degrees east, south-east of here. slightly left of the billabong tree. That's very helpful. Thanks. Quinn! get back here, young lady! [sigh] They grow up so fast these days. You know, my mom carried me in her mouth for two years. Yikes! [dramatic music playing] I've been walking all day, I can't be far now. That must be it! Hmm, I wonder if I can see Tasmania from here. Hey, that doesn't look too scary. That goat even looks kinda friendly. [growling loudly] Suddenly the Tasmanian Devil doesn't seem so scary. [ominous music playing] [nervously] I-I don't think I should do this. I don't think I can do this! Luckily for me, it never matters what I think. [grunting] [creature growling] -[cautiously] H-hello? -[creature grumbles] [echoing] I'm looking for the Tasmanian Devil! [creature growling louder] [thudding] [belches] [flies buzzing] You're the Tasmanian Devil? Hmm? No. Me, uh, someone else. Not Taz. [slurps] Yes, you are. You're him. I mean, you're a little more... stubby. But it's definitely you. Taz not here. Taz dead. Please, I need your help. Our food was stolen. What kind food? -Vegetables. -Meh. -They also took my dad! -What kind dad? A bandicoot. Like me, but bigger. -Ah! [slurps] -[chuckles nervously] Hold on. I don't want you to eat him. Or me. That's actually important. Probably should have mentioned that first. But I will pay you! Feast your eyes on this! Ew, what this you bring? Look like mushroom making bad mistake. No! It's food. It's delicious. [sniffs] Smell like turtle shell with no turtle. I know it doesn't look like much, but if you cook it right, it tastes better than anything you've ever eaten. Or anyone. [chuckles nervously] But my dad's the only one who can cook it. Help me rescue him, and he'll make you all the burgers you can eat. I'd find him myself, but I don't know my way around Tasmania, and-- [shouts] Tasmania? [slobbering] Me not go to Tasmania. Me not Taz. Hey, wait! Can I just ask you some questions? I won't be annoying or rude. Or sometimes I'm rude by accident, but only when I'm excited. [sniffs] It smells awful in here. Hmm, better than veggie booger. You're supposed to cook it. You know, with fire? Not in here, though. It smells like gas. Is that how you're supposed to smell or are you extra smelly? Aren't you lonely in here? Why don't you want to go to Tasmania? Is it scary? Did something bad happen there? Did you eat this entire whale by yourself? You did, didn't you? Doesn't look like you have any family. Me have family. [Quinn] Mmm? Oh! [chuckles] Very nice. Yeah, very nice. No room for little bandy-cooty. Go away. Me go to bed. You don't have a bed. Just a big whale skeleton! It pull out! But me sleep on ground. [grunts] Ow! Please! I just need someone who knows Tasmania. I'll take on Rocky myself, if I have to. You say Rocky? You've heard of him? That's great! Think of the adventure we'll have. [captivating music playing] We'll take Tasmania by storm. Working together, you and me. [thuds] We'll fight side by side, and we'll take on all comers. [koalas chittering] [grunting] Come on! You're supposed to be the Tasmanian Devil. Like this, look. [growling and babbling] And then you spin around like this. [blowing raspberries] -[Taz grunts] -[yelps and grunts] Me not Tasmanian Devil! Aw nuts. [eerie music playing] I can't give up now. I've got one more shot. [triumphant music playing] If I can grill this perfectly, he won't be able to resist. He'll have to lead me to Rocky. [imitating Rocky crying] "Please don't hurt us, Quinn! You can have your dad back!" [as Quinn] Too late for apologies, Rocky. En garde! [fizzles] [shouting] No! [eerie music playing] Ooh! [grumbles] [groans] Ow! [sniffs] Huh? This never would have happened if I wasn't so obsessed with telling dumb stories. Or if I were a time traveler! "Once upon a time, there was a time-traveling bandicoot--" [Taz growls and snarls] Huh? [Taz babbling and growling loudly] The Tasmanian Devil! [sniffs and chomps] Mmm! Hmm? Uh... [yells] Argh! Hot! Hot! Hot! The water! Go to the water! [babbling] [objects clattering and aquatic animals screeching] [cat screeches] More veggie booger. [panting] I told you it was good! I never lie. More! More! More! More! We can get more. All we have to do is go to Tasmania and find Rocky. Uh... no Rocky. No Tasmania. Too scary for little bandy-cooty. I am sick and tired of everyone telling me it's scary! I know it's scary! You know what else is scary? Not having food. Not having a dad. I'm already scared. [sobbing] And nobody wants to be scared with me. [burps] Forget it! Just eat me already. At least I won't starve. [captivating music playing] -What your name? -Quinn. Quinn give more booger. I told you I don't have any more. Hmm, we get more. From Tasmania! You... you mean you'll help? Find Dad, more boogers. [both] Find Dad, more boogers. [both] Find Dad, more boogers. [both] Find Dad, more boogers. [both] Find Dad, more boogers. Find Dad, more boogers. Uh... okay. [dramatic music playing] More! More! More! More! More! [gurgling] More! [water gurgling] [gasps] More! More! -[seagull squawks] -More! More! More! [water gurgling] [gasping] More! More! [panting and chuckling] [screams] [water gurgling] [groans] Ow. [sighs] Me have secret to tell. Me really am Tasmanian Devil. Yes, you are. [Taz warbling sea shanty] It's okay, Quinn. He doesn't know any better. Just enjoy the fresh air, the gentle waves, the cool ocean mist... -[warbling and spitting] -Ugh! Excuse me, Mr. Devil? Can you keep it down? Oh, yeah, Tasmanian Devil keep anything down. Never getting sick. Food never come back up. Always keep down. That's not what I meant. See? Jellyfish poison. But Tasmanian Devil keep it down. [yelping] Jellyfish spicy! [coughing] [gasps] But Taz keep it down. [panting] You see? Never sick. [stomach rumbling] That normal. Well, you might not lose your lunch, but I might if you don't clean your face. Ooh. Uh... Pardon. Our sail! What are you doing? Great! Now we're stranded until one of us eats the other one. Really looking forward to seeing how that plays out. What for you yell at Taz when I help Quinn? For make music? You sounded terrible. Taz not warmed up. ♪ Me me me me ♪ [clears throat] ♪ Me me me me ♪ [clears throat] ♪ Me me meeee! ♪ [blows raspberry] Look, once we rescue my dad, I'll pay you, and we can both go our separate ways. You don't have to get along. I mean, you're not here to make friends, right? Uh... Yeah. Not friends. Great. Now let me try and fix this sail. -[water splashing] -Now what? Uh... Taz? Taz? Whoa. Whoa! [screaming] Tasmania. We're almost there, Taz! Okay, you might wanna slow down. Taz? Taz! Oof! Phew! That could've been a lot worse. [groans] Home sweet home. Taz! The raft Is ruined! Oh, why did you hit those rocks? I told you to slow down. Rocks slower. Nothing slower than rock. Well, we don't have time to fix it now. We'll have to rebuild it later. After we've captured Rocky. And when we do find him, leave him to me. Got it? But you very small bandy cooty. So? Just because he's bigger you think he's gonna squash me like a little bug? No, bug much harder to squash. I don't care. Rocky's mine, and that's an order! Order? What mean you order me? It's nothing personal. It's just business. -That's the deal, remember? -[grumbling] Now, as the leader of this investigation, I say we go... this way. Based on my understanding of dingo criminal psychology, I believe they're traveling with the wind at their backs, downhill wherever possible. Whereas if they went this way, they'd walk into the sea and drown. And that's not Rocky's style. This is fun. Come on, let's look for clues in that swamp. I wonder how the lone buckaroo would handle this. Wait! Swamp dangerous! I'll be careful. "The lone buckaroo searched the dust for footprints." How am I supposed to find footprints in the dust? All I see is mud. Maybe there's some dust underneath... Uh... crocodile. Don't mind me. Just passing through. [crocodile growling] [sighing] Look, I don't want to have to do this, but I've taken on a lot of crocodiles in my day. Well, more like I've taken on one crocodile a lot of times. -Are all Tasmanian crocodiles this big? -[growls] They are! I should really be going, and screaming. Screaming and going! [screaming] [Taz straining] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. I'm too young to die! I'm just very mature for my age! [screaming] [Taz babbling] [both grunt] -Taz? -Yeah. Hello. Not Quinn. Not Quinn. Not think this Quinn. -[frog croaking] -Keep to be safe. [gasping] [spitting] Okay, yeah. Not Quinn. -You go. -But I can help. Go! Taz! Taz! Wow! Go, Taz! Whoo-hoo! -[crunches] -Ugh. Are you okay? [grunts] Not really. [screams] Oh, no! They got him in a death roll! Hang on, Taz. They're trying to make you dizzy. "Dizzy"? Me never get dizzy. [growling] That was amazing. You're amazing. I'm so amazed. -Are you ama-- -[grumbling] My book. Thanks, Taz. Hey, wait up. Wait for me. [Quinn straining] [panting] [Quinn] Wow, this is nothing like I pictured at all. I mean, it's wild, but it's so beautiful. How does it feel to be back? I'm sure there's a lot to take in. Yeah. Take in thorn. Take in splinter. Somewhere take in crocodile tooth. No. I mean, what do you feel? Feel thorn. No. What do you feel inside? Thorn inside and outside. That what make it thorn. Okay, do you want me to pluck them out? We not have to be friend. That what you say. We don't have to be. But that doesn't mean we can't be. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I didn't think you even had friends. [Taz grumbles] I mean, that's not what I meant. Look, I have trouble making friends, too. I'm quiet when I'm supposed to talk, I talk when I'm supposed to be quiet. It's like everyone knows the rules but me. The only one I'm really close to me is my dad. And he's... Not close at all. Mmm. We find him. Tasmania only so big. Bandy cooty only so small. But no more you order me. Me know Tasmania. Maybe I'm not all the time smart, But I'm not all the time dumb. You're right. I'm sorry. Friends? Friends. Great. Now will you let me take out those thorns? Yeah. Okay. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. This is pretty deep in your head. [straining] Maybe we should leave it? Yeah. Leave that one. Ow! Ow. Ow. Ow! Hey, I found that crocodile tooth. That one not from today. Ow! Ow! [wind howling] [bandicoot kids groaning] All right, kids, bed time. But I'm so hungry. -Yeah, me too. -[bandicoot kids] Me too. I'm starving. Well, the sooner you go to sleep, the sooner it'll be morning. Is there gonna be food in the morning? Uh... I can't tell you that, it would spoil a surprise. [chuckles nervously] Look, just go to bed, all right? I'm too hungry for this. -Let's go. Let's go. Move. -[bandicoot kids grumbling] Do you want me to keep watch? Yeah. Make sure nobody steals our den, all right? Thanks, Ned. You're a big help. Uh... Okay. Good night. [snoring] [sniffs] [grunting excitedly] Good morning. I was gonna ask if you're hungry, but that's kind of a dumb question, huh? You find more veggie booger. Not exactly. My dad never taught me the recipe, but I've seen him make it a million times. So I figured I'd do it for breakfast. One million breakfast? I don't mean all at once. I'm just making one. Oh. I'm pretty sure I got the ingredients, right. The important ones, anyway. This might even be an improvement. This veggie booger? -Yeah. -Why it scream? [screaming] Oh, that's just air escaping. Are you ready to try? Yeah, yeah. [babbling] We're going to take it out of the fire this time. Okay. Bon appetit. Bleh! Well, how is it? Tastes like food, only... -Bad. -Bad? Yeah. Taste very bad. Oh. Well, maybe the recipe needs some adjusting. But why are you still eating it? Me never have bad food before. You eat tons of weird stuff. I watched you eat fire. Yeah, that taste good. For me, all food taste good. Not this. Ugh, this bad. Okay, okay, I get it. Let's just get moving. The sooner we find my dad, the sooner you can have the real veggie burger. Come on. You don't have to finish that. [belching] What mean not finish? Never mind. [Taz babbling] Taz! [birds squawking] Hey, Taz! [blows raspberry] Don't you think we should be more quiet? We don't want Rocky to know we're coming. It might be better if we sneak up on him. Okay. Yeah, we sneak. [babbling quietly] That's not how you sneak. Like this... Move like a shadow, flow like water. [Quinn whispering] Move like a shadow, flow like water... Surprise! Huh? See? Now you try. Move like a shadow, flow like water... [Taz babbling] Here, let me get that for you. How are you such a fearsome predator when you don't even know how to sneak? If everyone hears you coming, they have time to get out of your way. Not if me not know which way me going. [laughs] Shh! Some things better not to surprise. [whispering] Like what? [twig snaps] [snakes hissing] This good example. Oops. Sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you there. [chuckles nervously] [screaming] Hang on. [straining] [Quinn screaming] [whirring] [both screaming] We're safe. I think. How do you do this without getting dizzy? Whoa! Whoa! If... If only we were heavier. Finally, some good luck. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. -[creaking] -Uh... I think we should all step off at the same time. One, two, three! I really am small, huh? -Ow. Ow. Ow... -Shoo! Shoo! [straining] High five! Ow! Taz! Oh, my gosh! Are you okay? [straining] How come ground move? We have earthquake? Quinn! You find dad! Look just like him. You raise fine daughter. Aw! Thanks. But I think you're seeing double. You're just dizzy, that's all. Taz never dizzy! Oh, yeah. That's right... Maybe me hit head? You think that's what caused it? No. I think maybe that fix it. -[thumping] -No. -No. -Stop! You're going to make it worse! That one not on purpose. [groans] Taz! Uh-oh. Brain fell out. You take. In case you need extra. This isn't a brain. It's a potato! Give back if you no like. No, no, no. I mean, this a potato. And your brain is fine. Mostly. Do you realize what this means? Yeah. But you say first. This is from our stockpile! Rocky and the Dingoes came this way. [gasps] Look at these tracks. Hmm. They must be dragging our food on a sled! They left the rainforest and crossed over those plains. Don't you see? We're getting close. We're going to find my dad! Ya-hoo! Hurry! Hurry! Oh, I wish there was a faster way for us to travel. Maybe that eagle would have helped us if we didn't knock him out of the sky, and catapult him into the sun. Not need eagle. No one faster than Tasmanian Devil! [groans] Wait. Can do this. [groans] Hey, hey! Maybe you should stop spinning. [gasps] If me not spin, me not Tasmanian Devil! Maybe me wombat, or big stinky mouse. [sniffs] Ugh! No, no. I shouldn't have rushed you. We can slow down for a little while. Can you see the trail? Or do you need help? Me not need help! [thuds] -[groans softly] -There's nothing wrong with needing help. It's a good way to make friends. Come on! [eerie music playing] Hmm. Looks like the trail's leading towards those mountains. I didn't know you had mountains. You have everything here! [echoes] It's wonderful! Scary but wonderful. It must have been a fun place to explore when you're growing up. It okay. Just okay? It's in your name! That's like if I were from a place called "Quinnsland" or something. My dad says I'm named after my mom, which makes sense. It would be weird if I was named before her, right? But I've never met my mom. What about you? What are your parents like? -Me run away. -Wow, really? Run away? Sounds like a good story. Bad memory. Bad memories are the best stories! What did you do after you ran away? Bad things. Like what? [gasps] Wait! What if it's not your head that's making you dizzy? What if it's a memory you don't even remember? You know, like from your subconscious? You've got to tell me everything! It's like, imagine you were bit by a snake, and I have to suck out the poison! Let's do the memory first. What's your worst memory? Me feel lost. Uh-huh! Me not know where to go. Yes! Tell me more! That all. We lost. Oh. You mean the trail. Rats. Well, things can only go up from here. Why won't you tell me what you did? It can't be that bad. It's not like you stole a bunch of food and kidnapped my dad. As long as you're not Rocky, you're okay in my book. -Speaking of books-- -How come you talk when me have headache? And quiet when near snake? Always wrong time you talk! [both grunting] Sorry for trying to get to know you. You're the one who wanted to be friends in the first place. -Not me. -Oh, yeah? Yeah! I didn't want your help. I wanted to come here by myself. Well, me just here for veggie booger. [mockingly] Oh, you'll get your "veggie booger"! I can't wait to pay you, so I never have to see you again! Yeah, and me not have to hear little bandy cooty! Fine, then! We don't have to talk! And when this is over, we'll never speak again. -Good. -Good. -Yeah, that good. -Very good! Total silence, never speak again. -[Taz] Yeah, never talk. -[Quinn] Fine by me. And another thing, instead of making imaginary friends out of seaweed, maybe jump in the water and take a bath instead! Ugh! Maybe you read book about not being nosy little bandy cooty! I'm intellectually curious. That for sure. Hey! What do you mean by that? And since when are you Mr. Clever? I happen to be... uh... [shivering] Freezing. It's cold up here. It get cold everywhere. Winter. Hey! A snow flake! Let's have a contest to see who can catch the most on their tongues. [chomping] Listen, Ned. We've been talking and... We don't think we need you to guard us anymore. You don't? I mean, it wouldn't be fair. We can't make your veggie burgers. And you must be getting hungry. Probably getting real hungry. Well, sure, but we're all hungry. That's true! I've lost a lot of weight. Just skin and bones here. With no meat at all! Not like the koala. At least he's still got eucalyptus leaves to eat. Juicy little guy's been housing eucalyptus, I tell ya. And look at them thighs! I'll keep watch for free if it makes you feel safe. We feel safe... Even when you're not here. Oh. Oh, I see. These snowflakes are actually kinda filling though. We have to keep moving. Too dark. Sleep here. What do you know? It was you getting hurt that slowed us down. Hey! What are you doing? Hmm. Say here it bad to fall off mountain and die. Say that maybe slow you down. [sarcastically] Wow. This good book. Gimme that! I never should have taught you sarcasm. Promise we'll go first thing in the morning! -Promise. -Fine. But I'm still not talking to you. Let's see how you enjoy the silent treatment. [snoring] Of course he snores in his sleep. [Taz] Me awake. I keep watch. [snoring continues] Well, I can't sleep like this. Maybe you need lullaby. ♪ Hush little Bandy cooty thing ♪ ♪ Wiggle you around ♪ ♪ And sing, sing, sing ♪ I don't need a lullaby. Maybe warm milk? What I need is for you to leave me alone. Why don't you go, um... sleep in that cave over there. Sleep in cave? Why not? You didn't want to leave your cave when we met. Maybe that's where you belong. I mean, you only came out for food, right? Uh, yeah. Food. Great. Goodnight. [shivering] The fire went out, Taz! Oh, right. I better build another. I hope he isn't too cold in there. How else was I supposed to sleep? I wonder where he learned that lullaby. He'd probably just get mad if I asked. [mockingly] "What for you ask me about past?" "We not friends now." [snickering] Hey! I do a pretty good Taz. [imitates Taz's warbling] "Me smell veggie booger." Wait a minute. [sniffs] "Me do smell veggie booger." [cackling in distance] [gasps] Oh my gosh! Is that Rocky's gang? I can't see from here. I need to wake Taz so we can sneak up for a closer look. Wait. What am I saying? Taz can't sneak. Even his shadow makes a noise. It makes a smell. I'll just get a closer look and come right back. And I won't try and play the hero. I am going to wear the mask, but only because it's cold. If that's Rocky's gang, they probably have look outs. And they'll be listening for even the slightest sound. [music playing] I'm 99.99 percent sure that's them. [all laughing] Our vegetables! [cheering] Thank you, thank you. I got to hand it to you, Rocky. You play a mean fiddle. Yeah, Boss, that was great. What about me? Uh, you did good too, Butch. Yeah, I like that you weren't trying to do too much. Aw, thanks. This is great! Sure beats hunting for food all night. Ah, you said it! That dopey crocodile was right about one thing. Hunting is for suckers. Speaking of which, all this dancing is making me hungry. Well, perhaps we should wake the Chef. Rise and shine. [gasps] The boys and I are feeling peckish. What do you recommend? [muffled speaking] Hmm, veggie burgers? Is that what you said? That's what it sounded like. Alright! Veggie burgers all around. The kitchen is yours. Oh, and Chef? I heard these veggie burgers could be dangerous if you don't make them right. Years of practice, I heard. Or else... [croaking] That's why Lou here, is going to have the first bite -[gulps] I am? -You are! And if anything bad happens to him, I'm going to lodge a very serious complaint. And believe me, you're not going to like where I lodge it. Understand? Ah, thanks for looking out for me, boss. And no onions, neither. Acid reflux. Now's my chance. I can't wait for Taz. I've got to get my dad out of here and bring our food back to the village. If I'm quiet enough to startle a snake, I can definitely sneak past these guys. -[snake hissing] -[Quinn screams] What do we have here? Aw, nuts. Another bandicoot. I know you said we wouldn't have to hunt no more, but this is crazy. You think that Chef would mind throwing this on the grill, eh? -Or is that too much? -That's a bit much, Lou. Maybe if boss asks. Oh, I do have some questions. Here's one. Do you know this bandicoot? [muffled speaking] What's he saying? Is that a "yes"? Maybe take the mask off. Let go of my dad, you big jerks. Before I do something I regret. Your dad? Well... You came all the way to Tasmania, all the way to this mountain, all by yourself just to save your dad? I'm impressed. That's family. Like you would know. Of course I would. This is my family. That's Butch, Lou, Sid... I'm Rocky by the way. You must be Quinn, I've heard so much about you. That's why we gagged him. Your dad's part of the family now. Which makes you family, too. There's no rules saying you have to be a Dingo. You just have to be brave, tough, and ready for adventure. Do you also have to be a dirty, rotten thief? It definitely helps. But we're willing to train the right candidate. We are looking for more cooks. Did your dad teach you how to cook. Hey, hey? [thumping] No, huh? It's never too late to learn. Let me go! Let... [muffled speaking] No talking during class please. Oh, yeah! I see the resemblance. [Taz sniffs] Hmm? You make secret veggie booger. That why you tell me to sleep in cave? Wait. How come no food? How come no fire? How come no Quinn? [gasps] How come no food? Okay, me have to think. Where I go if me Quinn? [Quinn mumbling] [mockingly] "I go find Rocky all alone. Even though me only little bandy cooty." Hey, that pretty good. Also pretty bad. Isn't this lovely? A dad teaching his daughter how to grill! It's always good to have a backup chef, in case something very bad happens. In fact, let's all pay attention! Go ahead, Chef. [giving muffled instructions] Uh, I didn't get that. Di-Did you get that? Can we untie his gag? She's going to mess this up if she can't hear him! Of course! How silly of me. I was just saying that you want to sear the outside first, because that traps the juices in, and then you bring the heat down, and you tell your daughter that no matter what happens, you love her very much. What if you don't have a daughter? Can you use eggs instead? No questions until the end! Your turn. Ju-Just do what he says and we won't get hurt. That's good! That's very good! You... You're doing-- [gasping] Great. Yeah. There it is. Welp, told you she'd mess it up. [coughing] Get her! C'mere, you! [growls] She's got a spatula, boss! What's she going to do, flip you with it? Just grab her! [Quinn whimpers] Hey, what the-- Run, Quinn! That's it! Run! Go! And never come back no matter how much danger I'm in and you just-- Well, that was it. Probably the last thing I'll ever say, and you completely ignored it! I'll give you one thing. You're one tough little bandicoot! Here's another cooking lesson, boys. -What do you do when your bandicoot's too tough? -[struggling] Hmm, tenderize it! Exactly. Butch? One more chance to join us, Quinn. I thought you liked outlaws! I like the ones that are heroes! [grunts] Hmm? Hey! Do you guys hear something? [faint rustling] What is that? [warbling softly] Me sneak. [growls] It's the Tasmanian Devil! Pfft, yeah, right! All the way out here in Tasmania? It's probably just some big stinky mouse! Get 'em, Taz! [growls] That's him, alright! Welp, it was nice knowing ya! Except for this last part. Well, yeah. [groans dizzily] Taz! That's the Tasmanian Devil? You said he was tough! Oh, he is! But I found someone tougher... Butch! Wow, you very big dingo. Thanks! You very big mouse! Finish him! Okay, Boss! [straining] [squawking] Aw, nuts. Aw, that's our food! Wait! Get back here! It's over, Rocky! You're going to take me on all by yourself? You're very brave, but not very smart. I usually work as the lone buckaroo, but sometimes it's better to have a friend! Get 'em, Taz! [warbles] Ha! You're you're a shadow of the Taz I remember! Huh? You've met before? Met? I practically raised him! You're lying! He's lying, right? Right? He didn't tell you? Taz was the meanest member of our gang! Now look at him. He can't even spin! Me not need spin! Ah, ah, ah! [playing sad music] Taz? What's wrong? He's been this way since he was little! The only way to control him was with music. Just snap out of it! It's me, Quinn. I'm afraid he can't hear you. Too bad! -Looks like he's heading for that cliff! -[gasps] Taz, come here, stop, watch out, wake up, watch out, stop! Come here, wake up! [Rocky singing] ♪ Hush little devil Don't you cry ♪ ♪ Papa's gonna kick you Say goodbye ♪ No! Hey, get off me! Let me go! Goodbye, Taz. You're like the son I never had. Seriously, it's like I never had him at all! Hyah! Taz! Ah! Isn't it great being an outlaw? You get everything you want. You've got your dad, your food, and now you get to be a real outlaw, just like in the stories. The outlaws in my stories wouldn't kick someone off a cliff. You see, to me, that sounds an awful lot like a law. And we're outlaws, remember? But we'll cross that river when we come to it! Nice work, boys! Anything we want, we take. All of Tasmania belongs to us. If you like, we could name a mountain after you! [chuckles] Give him the small one! I call dibs on the big one. That's Mount Lou! Aw! Hey, you want to trade mountains? It's an avalanche, genius! Pull faster! Faster! It's too late! [suspenseful music playing] The avalanche dried up the river for us! Ha! Even the natural disasters here are on our side! Oh, mate that tornado's here to help, too! [Rocky] Huh? [Taz warbles] Taz? Impossible! You're alive! [burps] But you're still dizzy. Maybe you need more sleep. Maybe it's your blood sugar. Maybe you're being haunted by a ghost. Have you tried ginger? Meditation? Volunteering? [gasps] Stop! You're hurting yourself! You're nothing without me. Too bad I found someone to take your place. Finish him! Give up, Taz! He's bigger, stronger, and less dizzy! Oh, yeah? [both warbling] Now it fair fight. Whoa! I can't tell who's winning. Me neither. Maybe this will help. You can't do that! It's not fair! See, that's another law and we're... [sighs] We need to discuss alternative teaching methods. I'm worried Quinn may be falling behind! Ahhh! [muffled] Quinn? And a-one, and a-two! [violin music playing] Taz! Look out! [Quinn] Hey, big guy! Ha ha! You miss! Uh-oh. [all screaming] Dad, I need your help pulling Taz! Okay, so he's on our side? I was confused about that. So that's where Quinn got her attention span! You're on my side now! Taz used to be, but we had to cut him loose. Like this! Go, Dad! Get off of me! Argh! [growls] Oh, dear. Ahhh! Oh! [all] Ahhh! [gasps] [panting] Dad? [sputters] Dad? Quinn, over here. Your friend doesn't look so good. Not friend. Me not say friend. Him say that. But, yeah, me not feel good. We are friends, Taz. You could have told me about you and Rocky. You were just a mixed up kid, who was lonely and scared. And you made mistakes just like me. I'm sorry I was so mean. I just wanted to know you and I couldn't understand why you didn't want to talk about your past. I figured you just thought I was annoying like everyone else. Either that or you're embarrassed because you don't know how to speak in the past tense. That not fair. This Taz third language. Wow, really? See, there's so much I don't know. [Rocky] And you never will! His story ends here! I don't think so, Rocky! [grunts] [groans] Dad! Leave us alone! Oh, I'm about to leave you more alone than you've ever been in your miserable little life. Taz may have turned into a big softie, but there's one thing about him that hasn't changed. His love of music! Not this time, Rocky! [gasps] That's all right. Every good musician knows how to improvise. [warbles] Any last words? I know you'll keep them short. You don't know any long ones. Something memorable like, "That's all, folks!" Or, "Suffering succotash!" Well, what do you have to say for yourself? [burps] -[belching and vomiting] -[Rocky screaming] Oh! It's horrible! Don't look, Dad. Close your eyes, [sputtering] [groans] Hmm? [screaming] What wrong with him? Taz! Are you okay? I think so. What happen? I think you lost your lunch. I think you lost a lot of lunches. And you've had some weird lunches. Oh. You can open your eyes now. Oh, my eyes are closed? Why can I still see it? Okay, it not that bad. This never happen. Me promise! Well, you look a lot better. Hey. Yeah. Feel good. [warbling] So, if it wasn't your fall, or your age, nor your head... what was it? What was the last thing you ate? Quinn make veggie booger. Oh, really? [laughing nervously] Hey, maybe it veggie booger. It doesn't matter. Maybe you very bad at make food. Okay. You make Tasmanian Devil sick. He never sick! Me eat entire whale and that during heat wave. Okay! Okay! I guess I need help with some stuff. But don't worry. My dad will make the burgers when we pay you for helping us. That not why me help. It's not? Me help for friend. Aw! Taz! But me will have veggie booger if you making them. I'll tell you what, Taz. I'll make as many veggie burgers as you want. Yeah? Yeah. [smacks lips] We still need to figure out how to get this thing home. I just want to get out of here before anything else happens-- [screams] [gasps and pants] -[Quinn] Ned? -[panting] [panting] Came to help... find your dad. [breathing heavily] Oh! Hang on. I got a cramp. Oh, what's this for? You helped me find my dad. Oh, I did? Hey, Ned! Hey, there he is! [cackling] All right, I did it! Bring it in! Mmm! [gasps] Is that the Tasmanian Devil? -[Quinn] Uh-huh. -[Taz] Mmm. Oh, is he going to eat us? [Taz and Quinn] Uh-uh. Great! Oh! Let's go home. All aboard! So, whatever happened to, Rocky? Well, I guess he's just not as tough as he used to be. [warbling] Veggie Booger! [warbles] And they tied us up and made us listen to terrible music. Suddenly, the mountain began to shake and before we knew what was happening the boulders rolled towards us! Whoa! Then what happened? Shh! Let her tell it! [Stan] I was! Sorry guys. To be continued! [bandicoot kids] Aw! Crikey! We gotta hear what happens! Well, what happened to your story? It was just getting good. Didn't you want to teach me how to grill? You said it might help me one day. Ah! I love cooking! You know, it saved my life once. But, it also got me abducted by dingoes and dropped off a waterfall. [chuckles] That's just how love is! That doesn't make a lot of sense. No, no, I guess not. That's why I'm the cook and you're the storyteller. We don't have to love the same things. Well, no, but it's still nice to share them sometimes with you. [suspenseful music plays] Hey, not bad. Maybe I'll try telling a story tonight. I think someone already has the stage. And then me get attacked by eagle. Big eagle! But me fight back like this, [warbles] [all gasp] [warbling continues] Then me fall into tree. Then me fall out of tree. Wow! Then what happened? Then the dinosaur came! Yeah. Yeah, that's true! Big dinosaur, me fight him, too. Oh! But then a ghost came to help you. -Yeah. -Ghost. The ghost had flame powers. Me and Ghost fight Dinosaur. First he went... [warbles] and then I did [warbles] . And then I showed up too. You? I don't know. I don't think the Tasmanian climate is warm enough to regulate the body temperature of a crocodile. -That doesn't seem realistic. -Mmm-mmm. Who cares? It's a good story. -[all clamoring] -Thanks, Quinn. You are going to write a great book someday. Maybe. I think I need to have more adventures first. How far do you think it is to Antarctica? Okay, then the Tasmanian Devil and Quinn fight the crocodile and the ghost. Hang on. I want to play. But hang on... Antarctica? I'll be the ghost. I'll be the Tasmanian Devil. Okay then me Quinn. But I'm Quinn! Sorry, dibsys me call it. He called it, Quinn! Okay, I guess he called it.
