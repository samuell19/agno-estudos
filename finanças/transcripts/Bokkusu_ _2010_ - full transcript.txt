That day, I saw a strong wind blow through... BOX! That day, I saw a strong wind blow through... BOX! Yuki! Ms. Takatsu... Heading home? You'll get wet. After school club? No... I was brushing up for a class. Straight 'A' students really are different. You like studying? Not particularly. I just don't do anything else. Nothing else I want to do. No girlfriend? Um, no. That's harsh! What? This seat's taken. Get outta here! You should be nice to old people. Got it? Ms. Takatsu, don't look... - I'm saying something. - Don't. Those are priority seats! Huh? Say what, sis? What're you lookin' at? Stop it! Yuki, call the conductor. Where you going? Is she your lady? It's okay. Go. What's wrong, little Yuki? - You wanna go pee? - Do it in your pants. "Violence hurts us all." A big, big hurt. Real big... A big hurt on who? You and your buddies, bro. Fools like you... Get your asses kicked. Punk! You little buggers! You want pain? Take that. And that! Kabu! Yuki? So it was you! Yuki! When'd you get back? Same uniform as me. Ebisu High? I had no idea it was you, man! This is Kabu. Yoshihei Kaburaya. He's an old friend. My English teacher. Teacher? No joke, I saved a teacher? What a score! You did a good deed. Thank you. No sweat. But, violence isn't the answer. It worked. Right? You woulda been dead. Not true. We could've handled it. Couldn't we, Yuki? I'll close an eye this once, but next time I'll report you. Let's go! I'm at "UFO Park" in Nishiyodogawa Ward. Look at these crowds of people. Why are they here? They're here to see a UFO! But do they really exist? Let's ask UFO expert Mr. Fujiwaki. You'll go stupid watching that much TV. Yoshihei, do your homework. I'm home! Hey, sis. Hurry and change. Okay. You're lucky you're smart, Yuki. I'm just a dummy. You can copy. Thanks! I guess your mom's gonna be late again. I'll make you some Okonomiyaki, okay? Okay. I'll make a special one. Ending up at the same school again... It must be fate. Don't start again, Ma. But I really do think it's destiny. Yuki's on the fast track. Ain't that great? Fast track? Fast... fast track. Right? Advanced class. Such a smart boy. Kabu's #1 in phys-ed. He's on the dummy track. Watch it! Is your mom doing okay? She came back too, right? Yes. To the same job. For company workers, it's a real pain if you're relocated. When did you move to Tokyo? It was... Grade 4. Winter break, Grade 4. Oh, yeah. That day we saw Yuki off was freezing. And then after the train left - Sis! Don't go there. What happened? He cried his eyes out. Ma! He was so upset he started cutting school. He finally went, but got in fight after fight. Ancient history. What a feast. It was great. I'm stuffed. My Ma... I named him "Yoshihei" myself! - Shut up. - Baby Yoshihei! Yoshihei, we got new pouches. - No, thanks. - Take a look. I said no. You haven't changed. By the way, when did you start boxing? Ah, not long after you left. I snuck into a gym in Nishikujo. I was shaking. But once I stepped into the ring, I was home. Will you go pro after school? Not sure. I wanna go to the Olympics. Wow, the Olympics... Yuki... I'm the real deal. Come on! This way! You can see a UFO. Have you seen one? I can make one come. Watch this. La-la, la-la, la... UFO! Hey... It's a couple of mama's boys. Don't tease them. They're from broken homes. You losers must be stupid. Believing in UFOs? Shut your mouths! Boneheads! What the hell! Get outta here! We'll get you back! How 'bout you? What'd you do in Tokyo? Study your butt off? You didn't get bullied like the old days, right? Oh... It's true. I didn't want you to find out. Why not? You should have told me- Because... I didn't want to tell you. So secretive. Sorry. Say... Yuki, why don't you join the boxing club? What? We can train together! You'll become tough! I can't fight. Boxing ain't like a fist-fight. It takes brains, too. 40 percent physical, 70 percent mental. You're 10 percent over. That's a bonus. A bonus? Just give it a shot. The sandbag's coming apart. Never seen it move like that. What an animal. Wow... You wanna put on the gloves? Can I? Kabu, have some guava and honey tea. It's good for you. Huh? Maybe I'll try boxing. Get outta here. Ain't watchin' me every day enough? No girls allowed, anyway. Okay! Hey, seniors! Sorry to bug you, but I wanna show Yuki my stunning style. Anybody wanna step up and spar with me? Coach said I'm not ready for sparring. Sorry, Yuki. They're all chicken. Kabu... Get the gloves and headgear. This'll be fun. But... Thanks for your time. Thank you. No running! Sorry. Many thanks for becoming club adviser. I couldn't refuse the principal, could I? Advisers don't have to do much anyway. They're good kids. Why do I have to watch over a bunch of barbarians? Kabu, stop! He's a real natural. What should we do? Call it quits? Iida, give up. Don't be so serious. Kabu's been fighting longer. Not yet. You guys! What the hell are you doing? Sorry, coach. We put on a match for some freshmen. Freshmen? Tomoko Maruno, class A junior. Let me join! I told you, no girls. And you? Please let me join the club, too. Yuki... Yuki... for real? 30 seconds left! Heels... Clench! Boxing's an honest sport. If you practice, you'll grow strong. Yes. JUNE Pull in your chin a bit, and rotate your body. Why? You're askin' me why? That's your liver. How are you gonna guard it? Good. Use your elbow. But if you drop your elbow, you'll take a hit. So now what? Well, you've got brains. I get it now. Liver, stomach, temple. Boxing is a sport of vital points. Defense is the key. You can never let your guard down. Kabu, stop! It's not a match! Yeah, but if he keeps runnin' away, I can't practice. Sorry. Don't apologize. Keep up your guard and counter-punch. He doesn't know how to counter! Captain... Didn't you ever just wanna win? Okay, that's enough for today. What kind of coach are you? Kabu, don't do it! Kabu! You only teach defense and no offense! Maybe that's why he's never won in three years! You're going too far! Apologize. Tomoko. Towel. I dunno. Kabu... It's not coach... I'm just weak. "No trespassing." Stop following me. I'm a fan. I got lots of fans. I'm sure you do. You're so cool. You think I like hearing all that stuff? Those are words for, a beautiful woman. I love watching you fight in the ring. You really shine. After national trials, why don't we go on a date? A date? Let's go to the zoo. Why the hell do I need to go to a zoo with a pig?! It's like punishment. If you don't make nationals, I'll take a rain check. Oink, oink. What the... FIRST DAY OF NATIONAL PRELIMINARIES FIRST DAY OF NATIONAL PRELIMINARIES What kind of boxing was that, huh? FIRST DAY OF NATIONAL PRELIMINARIES No answer? Sorry. What's with him? Trying to look all tough. You don't know? He's the king of southpaws. Naniwa Revolution X. Naniwa Revolution X? What's that, an energy drink? Idiot! That's Inamura. Tamatsukuri High. Inamura? He won the featherweight triple last year. He's a monster. Triple? Three titles: Inter-High, Nationals, and All Stars. He thinks he's hot stuff. I'll bag nine titles in three years. Yikes, what a freak! Freaky. Even Kabu couldn't win nine titles. Be quiet, Miss Piggy! I'll do it. A senior could only win a maximum of eight titles. Remember spring trials? You overslept and got cut. It was all part of the plan so I could get seven titles. Lucky 7 is cooler anyway. Ms. Takatsu, you're here! Good morning. Today's Minamino's final match. Thanks for coming. It's your last chance to win, Captain. If you face Inamura, you'll beat him. For sure. Hey! The lineup has been decided. "Featherweight: Minamino vs Inamura." Coach brought us bad luck. Forget luck. Everyone wimped out of featherweight so how it's a final. Yeah, it's a title bout. Congratulations! Good luck to you, too. Yeah. No stare-downs. BANTAMWEIGHT - BOUT 1 No stare-downs. BANTAMWEIGHT - BOUT 1 Back up. Touch gloves. What weight class is Kabu? Bantamweight. 51-54 kilograms. Minamino's featherweight, one class up. How about you, Yuki? I think I'll be one class higher. Lightweight. I mean, I will be someday. I'll punch that kid's lights out. Watch me. BANTAMWEIGHT - BOUT 2 So cool! DAY 2 "Kaburaya vs Miyoshi." BANTAMWEIGHT - FINAL They're going crazy. Yeah, they always do. Where's Kabu? Jesus! I can't believe this! This is no good! Miss Piggy, what the hell is this? You had a hole. Isn't it cute? Oink, oink. Cute? Time to start. Oink, oink. He was #4 last year. Don't screw around. Keep your guard up. Round 1. Just follow what I said! Stay calm! Stay tight! Guard up! So cool! If you win, we're going on a date! Shut up, okay? Can't your manager cheer you on? Of course not! What if people think you're my girl? That's okay with me. Sorry. What's so funny? Unbelievable. You won! The legend of "Lucky 7" has begun! Minamino and energy drink up next! Right on! FEATHERWEIGHT - FINAL That gorilla is a sadist. He's killin' him by dragging out the fight. Minamino, get over here. Keep your guard up! Coach... tell me how to attack. Never mind attacking. Defense. Please. I just wanna win one time! Go for it! Block with your left, then right hook! Shut up! Your first win! Round 2. Go. Hit him! Use your right! Right, right! Uppercut! One... two... Doctor! Captain, you all right? Hey! Are you okay? Winner: Red corner - Inamura. You knew you were gonna win! Why'd you have to play so dirty? Tell me! Stop it! Yo, I'm still talkin' to you! Where you think you're goin'? Get back here! Kabu's been disqualified. For now we're stepping down and Kabu's opponent will represent Osaka. Ms. Takatsu. A moment? Of course. Kabu... It's my fault you can't become Lucky 7. I'm sorry. Sorry... No problem, no problem. Right? It'll all work out. Yeah. We'll forgive you if you only win six. That's how it goes. Okay, let's go. Tomoko, call the van. Come on, everyone. See you. Kabu... Thanks. A friend. Cheer up. AUGUST Don't wimp out! You won't get through nationals with stamina like that. I'll just KO them. Don't over-rely on big punches. Tight and rapid fire! Bring it! Show me some spirit! Forewarned is forearmed. Winning on points is no fun. Right, Yuki? Hmm, but winning is winning in any case. Hey, captain. Where's, um, Tomoko today? Taking some time off. Time off? For what? She catch a cold or something? No, she's in the hospital. She has some kind of condition. Thank you for everything. These are for you. They're lovely. So pretty. Look. Thanks. We really appreciate your concern. So? All done? Yep. Please pass this to Kabu. He'll slack off if I'm not around. "Kabu's training schedule to win 6 titles." Did you go on a date yet? Please have this. Thank you. I'll put the flowers in some water. What do you see in him? Not long after I started school, I happened to pass by the boxing gym and saw Kabu. He was shadow boxing by himself. He looked so alive. Alive? Maybe that's a little extreme. But it was like... every fiber of his body was screaming "I'm alive!" He was so cool. Tight and rapid fire! Don't drop your guard! Yuki. Your guard! Don't drop it! Stop! See? If you drop your guard, of course you'll take a hit. Go from your guard to a one-two punch. Basic technique. But, coach... I haven't learned "two" yet. Two? I've only practiced my left jab. All this time... only your left jab? Yes. Four months? Yes. Then, I'll teach you "two". Yes! When I'm training hard, this does the trick. Want some? Back to stance. Bad form. Shoulders down. The one-two combo is the basis of boxing. Left jab, right cross. Live by it! Back to stance. Bad form. Your aim is off. Don't reach. Posture. Don't thrust so much! Back to stance! One, two. Good! One, two. One, two. It's unbelievable... These high school students change so quickly. Maybe... just maybe. You mean he's getting stronger? He hasn't missed a single day of training. It's even beyond what I'd consider appropriate. He's as serious as the rest of them now. Yo! You're dropping your left. Fight 'til the end! They really have progressed. Yuki, your jab's like lightning. Faster than you, Cap. I'll be the judge of that. I'll meet you at the restaurant. Hey, have you visited Tomoko in the hospital yet? You should go. Hey, champ! Kabu. Here. This is for you to read. I hate readin' words. Read it anyway. "Kabu's training schedule to win 6 titles." Women are a real pain. Shut it! Is it okay to eat so much? Crab omelette rice next. What about your fighting weight? I'm moving up a class. You are? Featherweight. Need to eat more. But that's Inamura's class. You're not worried? Nope. It's nothin' to do with energy drink. That's just like you. You're on a different level. That ain't true. You're toughening up. Really? Remember, no matter how strong you get, you'll always be 2. You're #1, right? So ya know. But we won't fight until after new year's. Yeah. Rookies start later. Hey... It's our old friends. And you are? Enough with the jokes. The train guys. Rematch time. Get outside. That's how it goes. A post-meal workout. Kabu... Let me. The little boy is so serious. Kick his butt! Good, Yuki! Get up! Use your jab. Left jab, Yuki. Jab. What's wrong, little guy? Beat him up! Enough... Get the hell off! Yuki... It's okay, it's over. You'll be okay. It's okay. Did you know that tigers are actually timid? They're scared as hell that they'll be eaten. That's why they bite so ferociously. Is that true? It ain't written down. The tiger told me. What? Friends can sense each other's strength. Right? You're ready. Stay calm. Kabu. Pull your punches. Camera all set? Yes. Let's go. Okay. Good. Just chill. Use your jab. Throw a punch! Bring it, Yuki! Come on. Let's go! Guard, Yuki! Guard up! Gimme one shot! Yuki, go for it! Yuki, throw some punches! One minute left! Right on! Nice! Give it your all, Yuki! More spirit! That was fun. Come over here. - Can you go one more? - Yeah. When Kabu throws his right his body follows through. You dodged it. I could try a right cross. What do you think? If the timing's right, go for it. If you connect, I'll teach you a left hook. Get in there. Go! Punch, Yuki! He did it. You got me. Yep, I did. You got me, Yuki! I did it! That was awesome! You did it! You finally connected. Sweet! Punch, Yuki! He hit him! You got me, Yuki! The round is still going. He landed another punch! Yuki's really getting strong. If he learns a left hook, all you guys will be KO'd. But Kabu's skill is amazing. I can't match his speed or style. You don't need to. True. You have a longer reach. You can specialize in fancy footwork. You think so? Yuki must be Kabu's biggest fan. It's obvious. That's why Kabu was so serious. He wasn't serious at all. Yes he was. I can tell when he's serious. Why hasn't he come to see you? He said he hated hospitals. He's probably scared of needles. What are you doing? It's okay. Take them home. I love bananas! Look! I won again! Just like I said. Everything I touch turns to gold! Everything? Oh, sure... Almost all those popsicles are winners. Who are you always here to see? Shh! Nobody. What the hell are you doing? Stand up and talk like a man, instead of playing with lucky Popsicle sticks. OCTOBER Watch me. That's it. Nice hook! 64TH OSAKA INTER-HIGH SCHOOL BOXING TOURNAMENT Winner: Red corner - Inamura. Winner: Blue corner - Kaburaya. Kabu's through to the finals. But Inamura's one tough customer. I'm worried. There's no way Kabu will lose. "Yoshihei Kaburaya." At last... "You won!" - "I'll KO energy drink and win the title for sure! - Kabu." Next match, Featherweight final. Kaburaya. Coming. Do your best. For Tomoko, too. I don't box for other people. I box to show people what real strength is. Little punk. The winner by decision: Blue corner - Akihisa Horiuchi. Superb. Good job. "Captain runner-up on points. Kabu's fighting next." - "I'll KO energy drink and win the title for sure! - Kabu." It's about time. Round 1. Stay tight. Rapid fire! Speed! Don't let up! Combinations! Go! You have to sign in. Minamino. Sorry. Excuse me. Kabu's getting pummeled. So? Last round's next. Even Kabu can't knock him down. He's losing on points. Never seen Kabu like this. He's a tough customer. Damn... You still think you can win? Of course. I planned this. The plan is... I turn it around like a movie ending. Listen. Tight and rapid fire. Lots of punches. Better to win on points. Now go get him. Coach... Watch me win it my way. Clobber him, Inamura! It's now or never! Show him, Inamura! Watch your left! Don't give up! Kabu! You idiot! Look out! He's probably in shock himself. Kabu blew it. I see... Thank you. See you. Hey, champ. "Open." "Resignation Notice." No way. It's true. Why? Tell me. "Cause you lost? Lose? Did I lose? Coach threw in the towel. No kidding! I thought of quitting for a while. I don't wanna do this forever. Kabu! Hey... why don't you quit with me? You forgot? I started boxing because of you. Later. Come to the gym. I'll wait for you. Thanks for everything... Bye. You're going to let him quit? Boxing isn't a sport you can force people to do. But all his talent... You think it's a waste? More than that, I'm annoyed. Even without natural talent, everyone's training so hard... Maybe Kabu quit so easily because he has talent. When you put all of your effort into fighting for something, you don't let go of it that easily. But because Kabu was born with natural talent, he didn't have to try that hard to become a strong boxer. That's why he threw it all away so easily. JANUARY "Kotomi restaurant Okonomiyaki, Yaki-Soba." Watch your finger. Don't worry. What's wrong with you? You hungry? I just made Okonomiyaki. Eat it. Nah. I don't need food. I need cash. It's pork. Your favorite. Eat it. You think I wanna eat that shit? Yoshihei, say sorry to mom! Useless jerk! Leave him be. Happy new year. Happy new year to you. "Kabu." Oh, no. You look so sad, master. Let Mami-Pooh's love make you feel better. Mami-Pooh's heart is full of love, all for you! Master, you really have the blues. Help him out, everybody! Mee-Pooh, come on. Coming! What's up? You wanna start something? Hey! Excuse me. Yoshihei! What the hell are you doing?! "High School Boxing Inamura - Unstoppable!" Last 30. Hold on a sec. Come on. You're hitting hard. Okay? Yeah. Hey everyone, I'm back! You left the hospital? Sorry I made you all worried. You look well. How're you feeling? Don't overdo it. I'm all better now! Hey, I know you slacked off. No way. I trained my butt off! Welcome back. Thanks. Back to training. ROOKIE TOURNAMENT Finally, your first bout. I feel a little nervous. Tomoko... you don't have to keep this up. Stop worrying about us. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not only doing this as Kabu's manager. I thought I could do a little to help everyone do their best. Oh... Sorry. Here, I made guava and honey tea. Want some? Thanks. I'm nervous. Really nervous. Stay calm. Keep your guard up. Loosen up! Keep cool! Jab, jab! Guard! Footwork! One-two! Guard up! Yuki! Yuki! It's a fluke. Don't worry. I'm here. Jab. Footwork! One-two combos! Throw a hook! Stay calm. You did it! I didn't know how it was gonna end! He could win the tournament. No kidding, kid-gloves. Right Miss Piggy? The final right jab was Killer. When did you learn that? Kabu! What? You're not allowed in. "No visitors permitted" Yuki... Hey... You look like a total jerk. What the hell are you doing? Hurry up! We're ready to go. Everyone's waiting for you. Come on, move it! Where's Tomoko? In the hospital again. Her condition got worse. Oh... Attention. At the rookie boxing tournament first year member Yuki Kitaru excelled in the Lightweight class. Nice job. This is too much. You deserve it. I'll show Tomoko, too. Look at this! Tomoko... Tomoko... Ms. Takatsu. Thank you so much for coming today. Tomoko had a weak heart since she was born. She seemed ready to give up on life, but since joining the Boxing club she said "If I do my best, it'll bring something good". She wanted so much to go back. The medical treatment she underwent wasn't easy. So we're very grateful for all your support. Thank you so much. And... is Kabu here? He couldn't make it today. I see... I wanted to meet him. I'll make sure he comes. No, don't push him. No. We'll make sure. Well... This may strike you as funny, but Tomoko said "I'll become Kabu's guardian angel after I die". She often said things like that. Angel... She may be watching over him already. Oh, it's just silly talk. Thank you. Kabu! Watch out! Kabu! You're just gonna run away? Run away and be a loser forever? Okay, let's go everybody. We're going now. I didn't lose. I just wasn't serious. Then get serious. And go back to being a boxer! Kabu. I'm moving up to Featherweight... the same class as Inamura. I won't run away. I love watching you fight in the ring. You really shine. Well, well. Everyone's here. I was just... cleaning up a little. Hey... coach. C'mon, stop staring at me like that! Please let me rejoin! You're in! Kabu! APRIL When you think 'I've reached my limit, ' you can go further. That's human spirit. Pretty good. Who wrote it? "Kotomi" Yoshihei. Back to work! How much can you pee? Ma! "Kotomi Annual Spring Party 2010!" Yoshihei. Don't forget the petals! Thanks! I named him "Yoshihei"! Enough, you crazy old bag! I'm the one who named him! Shut up! Getting used to things? Yes. No turning back now. Yes, coach. Then let's get to it. Proper stance! One... Two... One... Two... In time! Iida, take good care of them. Yes, coach. Do it like I taught you! Like this. Yuki, ain't my punch harder now? Yeah, it's probably your weight. Right. I'll KO Inamura in one. Going for featherweight? Absolutely. Got a score to settle with energy drink. So you're staying Lightweight, Yuki? Featherweight for me, too. Whoa. Who'll take on energy drink first? INTER-HIGH QUALIFYING BOUTS, DAY 1 Only four names in featherweight. So which one of us fights Inamura first? None of you do. What? But boxers from the same school are divided up. Energy drink weighed in as a Lightweight. What the hell? He wimped out. Somehow he guessed Yuki would fight as a Lightweight. He switched weight classes. Damn it. I should've stayed a Lightweight. "Yuki Kitaru." Hi, Yuki. I thought everyone went home. You're coming to see the final tomorrow, right? Coach asked me to be in Kabu's corner. I don't know what to do. But it's good that neither of you have to face Inamura. Why is that? Why? You think we'd lose? I didn't say that. Well, let's go home. Get lots of rest tonight. What? I'm going to win tomorrow... I'll beat Kabu for sure. "Featherweight: Yuki Kitaru vs Yoshihei Kaburaya." What a waste. Be cool. A friendly beat down. No kid gloves. Don't forget, you're #2. Coach, has Kabu got him beat? Don't be stupid. Yuki knows what he's doing. Good job. You're winning on points. Too bad for Kabu, but stay away from his big punches and you'll win. Coach... He still follows through too far on his right cross. I can win this. His punches hurt like hell. He really went after my weak spots. Because he's been watching you fight for so long. No kidding. It ain't looking good. Ms. Takatsu. Water? Teach me how to guard. Guard? You have to... put your arms like this. Like this? Okay, gotcha. I'll give it a try. Time. Round 3. Kabu, guard! Footwork! Guard up! Steady! Guard! Get away! Good! Please have him examined at a bigger hospital soon. He may refuse, but make him go. Doc. I'm bleeding. Just lick it and you'll be fine. You're a big boy, it can't hurt that much. Go. Do you think... Miss Piggy is watching over me? Yes, she is. She's never far from you. Thought so. I beat up so many guys in the past. Now I know how they felt. Yuki was a powerhouse. He's the real genius. He used to be so weak... What the hell... should I do now? I... All I can do is box... I'll see you in Featherweight. A UFO landed here once. Yeah, sure. You're too strong for me. C'mon, let's go. You won't beat me. You and me will be friends forever. I'll always stick up for you. Thanks... Ready to go? Go where? Roadwork. You'll run with me? What else? If you wanna beat energy drink, you heed a good training partner. Slow poke! You okay, Kabu? Yuki... don't wait for me! Keep going! But... This is your practice. Pick up the pace! "KO Inhamura!" Hurry, Kabu! Push it! Just tell me what you need. I'll do anything. Okay... can you pretend you're Inamura? Energy drink? Pretend you're a southpaw. Counter left uppercut with right cross. All right, bring it! I need new glasses. I couldn't see Yuki's strength, or how much of a man Kabu has become. C'mon! Watch your shoulder. Face him head-on! Harder. More rotation! Can you give it a try? Go for it. JUNE Yuki, let's go home. Kabu, what are your plans for Nationals? Me? I didn't think about it. You should go for it. You're ready. You could win Bantamweight. How about Featherweight? No way! I'll rough up energy drink before Yuki gets to him. What a guy! I'm proud of you. Done. "Members in nationals: Iida (Bantam), Noguchi (Light)." "Ide (Light-welter), Kaburaya & Kitaru (Feather)" Yuki's up first. Not how Kabu planned it. You're up soon. How do you feel? Ms. Takatsu. I'm number two after all. What? Kabu's number one. Why? He's always been strong, but now he's at his peak. He's the best. I hate to admit it. Yuki... go out there today and win. I will. Stand firm! Keep your guard up! Footwork. More footwork! Go, go! Good, good! Inamura's dominating. It's looking bad. But there's one more round. Will he make it? Inamura is really strong. It's the last round. Guard up. Jab, then one-two. Tight and rapid fire. All set! I'm getting to know his moves. Time. Go get him! Round 3. Guard, guard! Good. That's it! Watch his uppercut. Right cross! That's the way! Evening. Oh, Yuki. What happened? Your handsome face is ruined. I lost the fight. But Kabu really supported me. So I wanted to say thanks. Thank you. Kabu went out right after he got home. He told me to patch this up. No way I'm gonna lose, he said. Is it an important match tomorrow? He's fighting the guy I lost to. Really? So it's a revenge match? He's really gotta win, then. Good luck, Yoshihei. Good luck! Do your best! I will. Yuki! You're moving away? If you get in trouble, you can call me any time. Will you come and help me? Of course. If anybody bullies you I'll Kick my foot up their butt. I'll grow stronger and stronger. Then I can help you! I'll always stick up for you! "Featherweight Final: Inamura vs Kaburaya." Will Inamura go pro?! Have a good fight, Inamura. Thanks. Kabu... Way back, when I was a fighter, I was even more reckless than you. No matter how much I got beaten down, I'd just keep goin' back for more. Stupid. Very. I was an idiot. Then one day, I lost my sight in this eye. That's why. I tried to reign you in. But today... I ain't throwin' in the towel. I've always loved your style. If you stick to it, it might hold you back, but... The final bout in the Featherweight class will now begin. The fighters: In the Red corner, from Tamatsukuri High, Kazuaki Inamura. Good luck, man. You're gonna win. Finish him off in round one. In the Blue corner, from Ebisu High, Yoshihei Kaburaya. Kabu! Do your best. Yoshihei! Round 1. Watch it. Kabu's not the same. Get him! Fight! Kill him, Inamura! Stop messing around! Come on! Attack! Rapid fire! Guard up! Get away from him, Kabu! Yoshihei, get away! Take him in the next round. I will. Time. Round 2. Bonehead! You can't go pro like this. Get it over with! He really is a monster. It's not whether you win or lose. Just fight 'til the end. I love watching you fight in the ring. You really shine. You're right... I can't give up. Just win on points. Coach... please let me do it my way. Time. Yoshihei. Don't stop! Coming right up. Welcome. Yuki! Why are you dressed like that? I'm a working man now. You look so prim and proper. Not like my idiot son. Have some Okonomiyaki. Did you keep boxing in college? Yes. But I'm giving it up. Oh, what a waste. Go to the Olympics! If it was that easy everyone would do it. But if Kabu kept boxing he'd be representing Japan by now. You think? Even though the fool broke his own hand? Speaking of fools, the dummy is selling hot Okonomiyaki in Hawaii! "Congrats on the grand opening of Kotomi - Hawaii branch!" That day, I saw a strong wind blow through... Kabu! Kabu, get up! Southpaw! Fight! Go, Kabu! We did it! Winner: Yoshihei Kaburaya, Ebisu High School. Okay you did good. Yuki. I won! Thanks a million! Thanks to you, I did it! Sometimes the wind was strong, sometimes wild, knocking down the walls in front of us. It blew through the ring. English subtitles by Jason Gray & Eiko Mizuno
