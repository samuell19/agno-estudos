The Assistant Warden wants this one out of the block early. Wants to get it over with fast. Okay, let's do it. Psst. Hey. Come on, wake up, it's time. Wake up. Let's go, it's time. Well, this is it. 7474505B. - What wing? - Maximum wing, Block 9. Standard release? Parole, three out of five. Good behaviour. Give me a minute. One Timex digital watch, broken. One unused prophylactic. One soiled. Boots, black. Belt, black. One black suit jacket. One pair black suit pants. One hat. Black. One pair of sunglasses. $23.07. Sign here. What's this? What? This car. This stupid car. Where's the Cadillac? The Caddy. Where's the Caddy? The what? The Cadillac we used to have. The Bluesmobile. I traded it. You traded the Bluesmobile for this? No, for a microphone. A microphone? Okay, I can see that. What the hell is this? This was a bargain. I picked it up at the Mount Prospect City Police Auction last spring. It's an old Mount Prospect police car. They were practically giving them away. Well, thank you, pal. The day I get out of prison, my own brother picks me up in a police car. You don't like it? No, I don't like it. Car's got a lot of pick-up. It's got a cop motor, a 440 cubic-inch plant. It's got cop tyres, cop suspension, cop shocks. It was a model made before catalytic converters so it'll run good on regular gas. What do you say? Is it the new Bluesmobile, or what? Fix the cigarette lighter. What are we doing here? You promised you'd visit the Penguin the day you got out. Yeah. So, I lied to her. You can't lie to a nun. We gotta go in and visit the Penguin. No fucking way. Who is it? Jake and Elwood. Come in. Hello, boys. Nice to see you. Please, have a seat. No, boys. Come over here in front of me. I want to see your faces. The county took a tax assessment of this property last month. They want $5,000. Doesn't the Church have to pay that? They would, if they were interested in keeping the place. But they aren't. The Archbishop wants to sell this building outright to the Board of Education. What's gonna happen to you? I'll be sent to the missions: Africa, Latin America, - Korea... - Forget it. $5,000? No problem. We'll have it for you in the morning. Let's go. No. I will not take your filthy, stolen money. Well, then. I guess you're really up shit creek. I beg your pardon. What did you say? I offered to help you. You refused to take our money. Then I said, "I guess you're really up shit creek." - Ow. - Christ, Jake, take it easy, man. Elwood. Jesus Christ. Shit. Goddamn it. Son of a bitch. Jesus Christ. You son of a bitch. You fat penguin. Fuck this noise, man. You are such a disappointing pair. I prayed so hard for you. It saddens and hurts me that the two young men whom I raised to believe in the Ten Commandments, have returned to me as two thieves with filthy mouths and bad attitudes. Get out. And don't come back until you've redeemed yourselves. Boys, you gotta learn not to talk to nuns that way. Jake, Elwood. - Curtis. - Hey, man. You look fine, man. Good to see you, man. Hey, buy you boys a drink? Boys, things are bad. They gonna sell this place to the Board of Education and I'll be out on the street. That money's got to be in the Cook County Assessor's Office within 11 days. They wouldn't turn you out, would they? Shit. What's one more old nigger to the Board of Education? Curtis, you and the Penguin are the only family we got. You're the only one that was ever good to us singing Elmore James tunes and blowing the harp for us down here. Well, the sister was right. You boys could use a little churching up. Slide on down to the Triple Rock and catch Rev. Cleophus. You boys listen to what he's got to say. Curtis, I don't want to listen to no jive-ass preacher talking to me about heaven and hell. Jake, you get wise. You get to church. All I'm saying is we got to figure out some way to get that money honestly. That could be a problem. It's like the Penguin says. We've got to make that move towards redemption. We got to go to church. We've got to make that move towards redemption. We got to go to church. Bullshit. Come on. And now, this week's sermon is from our beloved, the Rev. Cleophus James. James. - Come on, Reverend. - Come on, preacher. And now, people. Take your time. And now, people. When I woke up this morning I heard a disturbing sound. Yeah. I said, when I woke up this morning I heard a disturbing sound. What I heard was the jingle-jangle of a thousand lost souls. I'm talking about the souls of mortal men and women departed from this life. Wait a minute. Those lost, anguished souls roaming unseen over the earth, seeking the divine light they'll not find, because it's too late. Too late. Yeah. Too late for them to ever see again the light they once chose not to follow. All right. Don't be lost when your time comes. "For the day of the Lord cometh "as a thief in the night." Amen. Say Amen.

So you know where they are. You said you were keeping in touch with them. I got a couple of leads, a few phone numbers. But I mean, how many of them visited or even wrote you, huh? They're not the kind of guys who write letters. You were outside. I was inside. You were supposed to keep in touch with the band. I kept asking you if we were gonna play again. What was I gonna do, take away your only hope? Take away the very thing that kept you going in there? I took the liberty of bullshitting you. Okay? You lied to me. It wasn't lies. It was just bullshit. What? Rollers. No. Yeah. What? What did I do? You failed to stop at a red signal. The light was yellow, sir. May I see your licence, please? God damn it. Man, I haven't been pulled over in six months. I bet those cops have got SCMODS. SCMODS? State County Municipal Offender Data System. Elwood, we show your licence currently under suspension. Step out of the car, please. First you trade the Cadillac for a microphone. Then you lie to me about the band. Now you're gonna put me right back in the joint. They're not gonna catch us. We're on a mission from God. Elwood. We are in high-speed pursuit northbound on Courtland Avenue. Black-and-white 1974 Dodge sedan with Illinois plates. Request assistance. We'll be all right if we can just get back on the expressway. This don't look like no expressway to me. Don't yell at me. What do you want me to do, motorhead? Try not to be so negative all the time. Why don't you offer some constructive criticism? You got us into this parking lot, pal. Now you get us out. You want out of this parking lot? Okay. Will there be anything else? Yes. Do you have a Miss Piggy? There's Hanson Burgers. Yeah, lots of space in this mall. Disco pants and haircuts. Yeah. Baby clothes. This place has got everything. New Oldsmobiles are in early this year. Pier 1 imports. They broke my watch. I'm gonna catch that sucker if it's the last thing I ever do. Nice place, huh? Hey, Sam. Hey, Lloyd. Anybody call for me on the phone? No. No calls. Some guy left this card. Cop. Said he'd be back. This here's my brother, Jake. He just got out of the joint. He's gonna be staying with me for a few weeks. Yeah. Okay. Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy? Well, it ain't much, but it's home. How often does the train go by? So often you won't even notice it. - What are you doing? - Making dinner. Want some? No. Tomorrow we got to get the band back together. I'm gonna quit work in the morning, first thing. And how are you going to get to work, Mr. Lead Foot, Mr. Hot Redder, Mr. Motor Head? Those cops took your licence away. They got your name, your address. No, they don't got my address. I falsified my renewal. I put down 1060 West Addison. 1060 West Addison? That's Wrigley Field. I gotta hit the sack. Hey, you sleaze. My bed. This, gentlemen, is the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues. Thanks for your help, Mr. Mercer. I kind of like the Wrigley Field bit. Yeah, real cute. All right, Sam? Hi, has my friend arrived yet? Failed to report in yesterday. I don't want no trouble. You just tell us where they are and there'll be no trouble. Stand back. It's almost 9:00. We've gotta go to work. Well, Elwood, sit down. What's on your mind? I got to quit. Why is that, Elwood? I'm going to become a priest. Well, okay. Listen, I'll call payroll and have them get your severance pay ready. Good luck. - God bless you, sir. - Well, thank you. What's this? This is the last known address of "Bones" Malone and "Blue Lou" Marini. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Yeah. Mrs. Toronto? Tarantino. Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone or Louis Marini living here? Not anymore. They moved out a long time ago. I don't take in boarders, not for a long time. - May we come in, ma'am? - Please. Did they leave a forwarding address? A phone number? No. Did they live quietly? What were their personal habits? They were good boys but they made a lot of racket at night. Are you the police? No, ma'am. We're musicians. Mr. Man. Mr. Man. Mr. Man. Yes, ma'am? They left this card. Maybe it'll help you? Thanks. Thank you. You're marvellous. You're marvellous. Thank you. I'm Murph, and these are the Magic Tones. Steve "The Colonel" Cropper, Donald "Duck" Dunn, Willie "Too Big" Hall and Tom "Bones" Malone. We'll be back for the Armada Room's two-hour disco swing party after this short break. Till then, don't you go changing. So, Jake, you're out. You're free. You're rehabilitated. What's next? What's happening? What you gonna do? You got the money you owe us, motherfucker? Look, let's just get something straight here... The reason he got locked in the slam in the first place was for sticking up a gas station to cover you guys. You're kidding. He pulled that job to pay for the band's room-service tab from that Kiwanis gig in Coal City. You did? That's right. So I don't want to hear anymore of this small-change shit. We're putting the band back together. Now, who here at this table can honestly say that they played any finer or felt any better than they did than when they were with the Blues Brothers? You were the backbone. The nerve centre of a great rhythm-and-blues band. You can make that live, breathe and jump again. "Murph and the Magic Tones?" Look at you in those candy-ass monkey suits. And I thought I had it bad in Joliet. At least we got a change in clothes, sucker. You're wearing the same shit you had on three years ago. Jake ain't lying. We had a band powerful enough to turn goat piss into gasoline. We'll never get that fat sound again. Not without some more horns. We'll never get Mr. Fabulous. Where is he? Forget it. Mr. Fabulous is the top maitre d' at the Chez Paul. He's pulling down six bills a week. Matt Murphy got married. Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy? He opened a soul food restaurant with his old lady on Maxwell Street. And he took Blue Lou with him. You'll never get Matt and Mr. Fabulous out of them high-paying gigs. Oh, yeah? Well, me and the Lord, we got an understanding. We're on a mission from God. Mainly French cuisine. No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer dines here. He's dead, sir. Private dining rooms are available. Oh, no. I thought it was supposed to be 5 years. Didn't you get 5 years? No, sir, not you. And your name, sir? Rizzolo, for 8 at 11:30. Thank you. Mr. Fabulous, how marvellous it is to see you. You're looking younger than ever. Wait. You guys can't come in here. Oh, nonsense, my dear fellow. My brother and I have come to dine to celebrate my early release from the service of the state. Wait. Let's talk outside. Let's have a cup of coffee outside. Why, heavens, no. We seek a full meal and all the compliments of the house. Come, Elwood. Let us adjourn ourselves to the nearest table and overlook this establishment's board of fare. Good evening. Chez Paul. Wait. Hey. Sir, do you mind calling back in about five minutes, please? I'm sure, we'll have a table for you in just a few moments. Excuse me, won't you? Give us a bottle of your finest champagne, five shrimp cocktails and some bread for my brother. We have a Dom Perignon, '71, at $120. That'll be fine, pal. Come on. Seriously, you guys, the food here is really expensive. The soup is fucking $10. Come on. Let's go outside. I'll buy you a cup of coffee. We're putting the band back together. Forget it. No way. We're on a mission from God. Hold it, hold it. What's this? Waiter? Sir? Please, waiter? Yes, sir? How are your salads? The salads are fine. It's just that we'd like to move to another table, away from those two gentlemen. Why? Have they been disturbing you? No. It's just that, well, frankly, they're offensive... smelling. I mean, they smell bad. Excuse me, sir. I'll see if I can locate another table for you. Thank you. Wrong glass, sir. How much for the little girl? The women? How much for the women? What? Your women, I want to buy your women. The little girl. Your daughters. Sell them to me. Sell me your children. Maitre d'. Maitre d'. Hey, cut it out, cut it out. The owners are gonna ask me to call the cops. You wouldn't do that to me, would you, man? He just got out of Joliet. He's on parole. You can't call the cops on him, man. We're putting the band back together. I said no. Absolutely not. You. How much for your wife? We're putting the band back together. We need you, man. We need your horn. I can't. I really can't. We got everybody except Matt "Guitar" Murphy and Blue Lou and we're getting them next. No way. If you say no, Elwood and I will come here for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day of the week. Okay, okay. I'll play. You got me. White men. White women. The swastika is calling you. The sacred and ancient symbol of your race since the beginning of time. The Jew is using the black as muscle against you. And you are left there, helpless. Fuck you. Why don't you go back where you belong? What are you gonna do about it, Whitey? Just sit there? Go back where you came from. Of course not. Son of a bitch. You are going to join with us, the members of the American Socialist White People's Party.' an organisation of decent, law-abiding white folk just like you. Blow it out your ass, you bastards. Go to hell. I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler. I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler. The immortal leader of our race. The immortal leader of our race. To the order for which he stands. And to the order for which he stands. One great cause. One great cause. Sacred and invincible. Sacred and invincible. Hey, what's going on? Those bums won their court case, so they're marching today. What bums? The fucking Nazi Party. Illinois Nazis. I hate Illinois Nazis. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Ten hut. Gruppenführer. Yes, sir. Gruppenführer, get that car's licence plate number.

Can I help you, boys? You got any white bread? Yes. I'll have some toasted white bread, please. You want butter or jam on that toast, honey? No, ma'am. Dry. Got any fried chicken? Best damn chicken in the state. Bring me four fried chickens and a Coke. You want chicken wings or chicken legs? Four fried chickens and a Coke. And some dry white toast, please. You all want anything to drink with that? - No, ma'am. - A Coke. Be up in a minute. We got two honkies out there dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants. Say what? They look like they're from the CIA or something. What they wanna eat? The tall one wants white bread. Toast. Dry. With nothing on it. Elwood. And the other one wants four whole fried chickens and a Coke. And Jake. Shit. The Blues Brothers. Hi, Jake. Matt. How you doing? How you doing? How was Joliet? Oh, it's bad. On Thursday night they serve a wicked pepper steak. Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls at the Terre Haute Federal Pen. Or that oatmeal at the Cook County Slammer. They're all pretty bad. Matt. Me and Elwood, we're putting the band back together. We need you and Blue Lou. Oh, man. Don't talk that way around here. My old lady, she'll kill me. Ma'am, you gotta understand. This is a lot bigger than any domestic problems you might be experiencing. Matt, what the hell is he talking about? Don't get riled, sugar. Don't you, "don't get riled, sugar" me. Now, you not going back on the road no more. And you ain't playing any more two-bit, sleazy dives. You're living with me now. And you're not gonna go sliding around with your old white hoodlum friends. But, babes. This is Jake and Elwood. The Blues Brothers. The Blues Brothers. They still owe you money, fool. Ma'am, would it make you feel any better if you knew that what we're asking Matt here to do is a holy thing? You see, we're on a mission from God. Don't you blaspheme in here. Don't you blaspheme in here. Now, this is my man, this is my restaurant, and you two are gonna just walk right out that door, without your dry, white toast, without your four fried chickens and without Matt "Guitar" Murphy. Now, you listen to me. I love you. But I'm the man and you're the woman. And I'll make the decisions concerning my life. You better think about what you saying.

Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake. I once rented some column speakers from you for my band, The Blues Brothers. Hey, Ray. It's me, Murph, of Murph and the Magic Tones. Remember me? I bought three Fender amps. Oh, we sell a lot of amplifiers. Not like these. They were beautiful. Upholstered with thick, red shag. Oh, right, right. I remember now. As a matter of fact, I'll buy them all back for $350 a piece. $350? I paid $800 each, not 6 months ago. Well, you know depreciation, man. Ray, we're here to buy stuff. We need pianos, amps, mikes, the works. Now, go on. Get. Breaks my heart, a boy that young going bad. Tell me a little about this electric piano, Ray. Oh, you have a good eye, my man. That's the best in the city of Chicago. How much? $2,000 and it's yours. You can take it home with you. Matter of fact, I'll throw in the black keys for free. $2,000 for this chunk of shit?

Have I ever lied to you? What are we gonna do, man? We don't got no gig. How much money you got? I got a quarter. That's enough for a phone call. Come on. What are you doing, Elwood? You said we were gonna make a call. I said I was gonna make a call. Who are you gonna call, Jake? Do you remember Maury Sline? Sline? Booking agent? What about him? He got us some good showcases in the old days. He got us the Morgan Park, he got us the Tick Took. I got him laid. He owes me. Give it a shot. Hey, Jake. There's got to be at least $7 worth of change here. Yeah? Sir. What did you find out? Okay. I called a friend at the Motor Vehicle Department. That licence plate is like a rash all over the computer. The car belongs to a known traffic menace. What's his name? His name is Elwood Blues. He's got a record a mile long. And he's a Catholic. - Did you get his address? - Of course. 1060 West Addison. Let's go. Anybody with that kind of record is gonna make a mistake. I want all party members in the tri-state district to monitor the city, county, and state police on their C.B's. Mr. Blues is gonna fuck up. And when he does, he better pray the police get to him before we do. All right, man. We've been in this car for three hours now. Where the hell is this place? I told you it'd take a little while to get there. What's the name of the place? The name of the place is, Bob's Country Bunker. Here we are. Bob's Country Bunker? Jake, the sign says, "Tonight only, the Good Ole Boys." Blues Brothers. It should read, "Tonight only, "the Blues Brothers' triumphant return." Must be some kind of mistake. You guys unload the stuff. Elwood, come with me. What can I get you boys? You thirsty, you hungry or just driving through? Maybe you'd like a beer, or something a little harder? We happen to make the state's best pepper steak. No, thank you, ma'am. We may be sucking back a few beers a little later on. We'll be here all night. You see, we're the band. You are? Oh, gee, that's nice. Hey, Bob, this is the band. All right. What kind of music do you usually have here? We got both kinds. We got country and western. Jake, are you sure this is the place? Yeah. Sure. This is the place. Hi. You the Good Ole Boys? That's us. The rest of the band's out in the parking lot getting our stuff together. Well, I'm sure glad to have you boys here. I'm Bob and this here is my place. It's a beautiful place, Bob. I guess you wanna get your steel guitars and everything set up on stage, don't you? Claire, go and turn those stage lights on and get these boys going up there. Chicken wire? What do you say we set up for sound check? Excuse me, sonny, I guess I'll give this to you. You're the tallest one. Okay, what is it? Well, that there is a list of the songs you boys will be playing tonight. Man, I don't think we know any of the songs on this list. This list doesn't mean anything. They're just requests. Do our regular set. First tune. Give Me Some Loving. One, two. One, two, three, four. What are those damn freak pecker heads playing? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We're glad to be here in Kokomo tonight. We're the Good Old Blues Brothers Boys Band from Chicago. We sure hope you'll like our show. I'm Elwood. This is my brother Jake. ♪ Well, my temperature's rising and my feet on the floor ♪ ♪ Crazy people knocking Because they wanted some more ♪ ♪ Let me in, baby I don't know what you got ♪ ♪ You better take it easy Because this place is hot ♪ ♪ And I'm so glad you made it ♪ That ain't no Hank Williams song. ♪ Give me some loving ♪ Get off the stage. ♪ Give me some loving ♪ ♪ Every day ♪ Why'd they turn off the lights?

Shit, I wanna tell you boys that's some of the best goddamn music we've had at the Country Bunker in a long time. Sorry we couldn't remember The Wreck of the Old 97. Why, hell. You guys can learn it next time when you come back. Bob, about our money for tonight. That's right. $200 and you boys drank $300 worth of beer. When we first came in the bar lady never charged us for the first round so, like, we figured beer was complimentary for the band. Beer was, like, complimentary for the band, you know. No. Well, I'll just go out and take up a collection from the boys. Well, I'll tell you, I sure would appreciate it. I say this trip is nowhere, man. I say we gotta quit. What? Quit? Well, I wish you guys would make up your mind. Otherwise, I've gotta call Mr. Ronzini at the Holiday Inn and get our old gig back. Back at the Armada Room? Listen, they want us to pay for the beer we drank. So you guys better split. The next gig is gonna be dynamite. Huge. You'll see. I say we give The Blues Brothers just one more chance. Why not? If the shit fits, wear it. Scoot over, goddamn it. Boys look a little upset. Hey, man. Don't worry. We got a couple of days. We'll get the Penguin's tax money. I mean, look. We got an appointment to see Mr. Sline tomorrow. Everything's gonna be all right. Let's skate. Goddamn it. Excuse me, gentlemen. Are you The Good Ole Boys? Yeah, that's right. I'm Tucker McElroy, lead singer, driver of the Winnebago. I'd like to talk to you, but we're running very late. My name is Jacob Stein, American Federation of Musicians Union, Local 200. I've been sent here to see if you gentlemen are carrying your permits. Our what? Your union cards. May I see your cards, please? Suppose we ain't got no union cards and we go in and start playing anyway. What you gonna do about that? You gonna stop us? Stein? You gonna look pretty funny trying to eat corn on the cob with no fucking teeth. Listen, let me talk to Bob, the owner. See if we can put your band on contract waivers for tonight. I don't want you to move from this spot. Just let me handle this. We'll, We'll talk to Bob. Get in the car and start her up. You know you boys owe me a lot of money for that beer you drank tonight. Goddamn it. Bob, we loved playing here tonight. My brother's writing out an American Express traveller's cheque to cover the extensive bar tab. Well, I sure would appreciate it. I'd better check up, see how he's doing. See, I have to sign it, too. I usually sit in the car and write it out on the, glove compartment lid. Okay? I need a pencil. Were them guys from the union? Union? What the hell union? Those boys skipped out of here owing me a lot of money for beer. What the hell are you guys all dressed up for? We're The Good Ole Boys. You're The Good Ole Boys? A.F.M. Shit. Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration, don't fail me now. I don't believe it. It's that shitbox Dodge again. The bastards are ours now. Holy shit. Boys, you're in big trouble. Maury, you owe me.

I might have some information she'd like to know. You blackmailing me? If you wanna put it that way. Maury, we need this gig. We're on a mission from God.

You look just fine down there slithering in the mud like vermin. No problem. You're not gonna get away from me this time. Check that out. Let's go. It's good to see you, sweetheart. You contemptable pig. I remained celibate for you. I stood at the back of a cathedral waiting, in celibacy, for you with 300 friends and relatives in attendance. My uncle hired the best Romanian caterers in the state. To obtain the seven limousines for the wedding party my father used up his last favours with Mad Pete Trullo. So for me, for my mother, my grandmother, my father, my uncle, and for the common good I must now kill you and your brother. Oh, please don't kill us. Please, please, don't kill us. You know I love you, baby. I wouldn't leave you. It wasn't my fault. You miserable slug. You think you can talk your way out of this? You betrayed me. No, I didn't. Honest. I ran out of gas. I had a flat tyre. I didn't have enough money for cab fare. My tux didn't come back from the cleaners. And old friend came in from out of town. Someone stole my car. There was an earthquake. A terrible flood. Locusts. It wasn't my fault, I swear to God. Oh, Jake... Jake, honey. Let's go. Take it easy. You're going to totally demolish the cars. You want to maybe consider going after the Blues Brothers? It's 106 miles to Chicago. We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses. Hit it. Shit, man. Can't this damn thing go any faster than this? Bob, I think I've got a little problem. Goddamn, boy. Don't you say a fucking word. All units, we have a signal 10-79. Officers are in pursuit: a black-and-white 1974 Dodge sedan southbound on 47. Respond to signal 10-79. Occupants of vehicle: one Joliet Jake Blues, one Elwood Blues. Considered extremely dangerous.

If my estimations are correct we should be very close to the Honourable Richard J. Daley Plaza. That's where they got that Picasso. Yep. Son of a bitch. There they are. Oh, no. What the fuck was that? The motor. It's thrown a rod. Is that serious? Yep. Faster. Faster. Holy shit. I've always loved you. There it is. Come on.
