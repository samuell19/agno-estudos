THE BASTARD Screenplay by Ryozo Kasahara Based on the autobiographical novel by Toko Kon Produced by Masayuki Takagi Cinematographer: Shigeyoshi Mine Art Director: Takeo Kimura Music: Hajime Okumura Editor: Akira Suzuki Assistant Director: Saburo Endo Directed by Seijun Suzuki At the beginning of the Taisho era, in a train through the mountains in Tajima Basin... A mother and son, with the air of city-folk, were traveling together. The boy had the reputation of a poorly behaved bad-boy He'd been expelled from Shinsei Academy in Kobe His name was Togo Konno, and the woman was his mother We're getting off. We get off at Toyooka, the next station. But Kinosaki Onsen is the one after. I know. Why would we be getting off at Toyooka? Togo, take down your luggage. What are we doing at Toyooka? I need to call on an old friend as long as we're here. Who? We'll go on to Kinosaki Onsen in the evening. When we get to the onsen, let's talk about my going to Tokyo. At any rate, we'll have a talk Come in. This is the boy. -You're Togo? -Yes You're the son of a ship captain, so does that mean you can row a boat? I can row any Japanese-style ship. That's impressive. Would you take my son on the boat? Yes, but... Oh, but you're going to Kinosaki Onsen. You have until the evening to use the boat, then. Your mother will be waiting for you here. -What is it? -Call for the young master Our young master is a boy in third grade of elementary school. That's when they are most precious. Unfortunately, only children are so often spoiled. If he's in third grade, that makes him the same age as Togo's second brother. If Togo is the eldest of three brothers, that gives him a lot of responsibility. Yes, it would be good if he took that responsibility seriously. As you say. But he always picks on them as soon as he gets home. Welcome - Yamato, call this boy your older brother. - Yes Togo... Excuse me. Should we go now? We'll be back later. I'm sorry... it got like this when my husband was out. And if it weren't for you, I don't know what I would have done. What does your father do for a living? He's a middle school principle. Oh, a principal? Are you going into father's middle school? No, I'm not After my summer vacation's over, I'm going to a private middle school in Tokyo. Where did you used to go to school? Shinsei Academy in Kobe. Then why do you have to go to school in Tokyo now? What does that matter? You're like a school principal yourself, with all the questions. Yeah, I'm like my father! I'll be a school principal just like him. -Oh, hello! -Hello. Where are you off to? Emiko! Do you know those girls? Yeah, one is Yoshie. She's from the family that owns the local ryokan. The other one is the Doctor's daughter, Emiko. Big Brother! Isn't it good? It's not bad. That's Emiko playing. You couldn't tell? Make yourself at home. Where did my mother go? Your mother dropped you off and then left. But I thought we were going to Kinosaki Onsen. No, she left you in my care so that she could return to Kobe in peace. Left me in your care? What does that mean? Okay, I'll explain it to you. Your mother... after you got yourself expelled from Shinsei Academy in Kobe... consulted your grandfather in Yokohama. Your grandfather is a very old friend of mine. And he remembered me, and apparently decided he'd be most at ease with you in my care. Then your mother sent me a letter. I still don't understand. What is it that you don't understand? If she was leaving me in your care, why didn't she say anything? It was already decided. You'll be going to Toyooka Middle School. What? Here? Well, look at this! I guess you are entering father's school, after all! Here you are, Mr. Togo. But this is a prefectural school... which means you'll have to take the entrance exam to be admitted. You know that, right? So let's eat now. I'm going back to Kobe! How can you be so cheerful? Your father studied overseas, but you get expelled from school! That's nothing to be happy about! Don't you ever consider how you've embarrassed your younger brothers? Stop whistling! Why can't you face up to reality? It's painful for me to think about you. In that case, I'll run away! If you want to run, then run! Togo! Togo! AWAJI ISLAND I'm very sorry. If we'd known, we'd have helped you find him. But he hardly said a word. If I'd known anything, I would have told you. Did he lose interest? You've been traveling with them, haven't you? Before we go back to Kobe, I was thinking we would make a trip to Kinosaki Onsen. I talked to your grandfather in Yokohama. He thinks we should make a trip to Kinosaki Onsen. After that, you'll enroll in school in Tokyo. Does that sound like something you want to do? Yes, I do. I'll study literature in Tokyo! She deceived me to make me come here. In that case, I know what I'll do! Not here. Take me all the way to the entrance. -To the entrance? Really? -Yes! Look at this! - Is this the janitor's office? - Yes, it is. Are you here for the entrance exam as well? Sit down over there. What kind of backwater school makes its students wait to take the entrance exam in the janitor's office? Move over for me. You get moving, too. - What? - What? I'm still waiting on my tea! What's this? Are you smoking? Yeah. What of it? You can't smoke in a middle school. How is it any different for a middle school student than an adult? They're older. If you're not an adult, the police will scold you. As far as I'm concerned, I *am* an adult! Would you all like to smoke as well? Are you feeling ill? No, but I want to sleep. But you have to take your test now! I didn't sleep until late last night. That's no good. It's important to sleep well the day before a test. That's idiotic. I don't sleep for tests. Nighttime is when I like to read. What are you reading? - Novels. - Novels?! Begin! Finished! - What? Already? - Yes. Where do you think you're going? Since I finished this test, I'll be waiting for the next one in the janitor's office. Mr. Konno! The school headmaster wants to see you. - Togo. - Yes? Are you really incapable of answering any of these questions? Yes. Are you sure of that? Yes! Since you got zero points on everything, it would seem you can't enter this school. If you can't enter school here, you'll return to Kobe. And from Kobe, you'll go on to Tokyo. Is that what you think? Yes. That's what will happen in the end. The only problem is I won't let you. What? Why? Since you're clearly not qualified to enter as a fourth-year student, I'll admit you as a third year student. Yes... if you redo your third year, that should fix everything. You have a long life ahead of you, so we may as well take the time to do things the right way. Well, that's that. Let me take the test again! I don't need to retake third year! I'll do better this time! All right. You still have time left over! How'd you do? Did you pass? Well, I guess we'll see. I don't have any confidence. I can't do math. I can't do math either. I was so surprised when you said you were finished. I didn't know anyone could finish so quickly! Hadn't you better go back? Yes. I'll go back and fix it now. But is it really okay to do that? It's probably hopeless by now, isn't it? You're really unreasonable, aren't you? Now I've made myself totally indebted to the headmaster. And so he's totally defeated me. Do you have the October Edition of Shirakaba? No, it doesn't seem to have arrived yet. Do you know the Kuroshima household around the corner that way? I know it. That's where I'm lodging. When the new issue of Shirakaba arrives, bring one to me. Yes, if you say so. That girl who was in here just now- what book did she buy? It was Strindberg's "The Red Room". Oh, so she's reading Strindberg? That was an upperclassman, so we're supposed to pay our respects. Didn't you have to pay respects to your upper classman at your school in Kobe? Maybe; I'm not sure. They're very strict about it here. If you don't pay your respects, the upperclassmen will beat you up. Let them try it. Having to bow for an idiot upperclassman like that one is worse than getting beaten up. You're really unreasonable. That's right. I was unreasonable before I came here... ...and I intend to be unreasonable here too. Just watch what I do and you'll want to be like me. I don't think I can do that. It's not so bad. I have to admit that I'm impressed you could tell he was an idiot just from one look, though. He's called "Octopus." He's not a very good student, and he moves around like an octopus. There are rumors he's deeply in love with a beautiful young woman here, and keeps trying to court her. Oh, who? The one who lives in that house we just passed. Doctor Okamura's daughter. What? Doctor Okamura? Really? That guy, with her? Wow, you're so extravagant! You think this is extravagant? I've been banished to live with such provincial people. Wow, you even smoke! You're even surprised to see me smoking. If they find out, a group of upper classmen called the "Public Morals Bureau" will come visit you. What's that? The fifth year class president and vice president lead a group called the "Public Morals Bureau". They look around town at night to make sure students are behaving. You mean they monitor us at home? Yes. They'll come into your house all of a sudden, totally at random, for inspections. They look for things and activities that are unbecoming for students. Isn't that trespassing? I don't know anything about that. But the Public Morals Bureau can do whatever they want. If you smoke, so they will punish you. What if I'm carrying a photograph of a girl? Of course! Are you carrying a photograph of a girl? I am. A girl in Kobe gave it to me. You'd better hide it quickly! You really are bad. Everybody carries girl's photographs! There's no rule that says I can't. I don't know about a law... ...but middle school students aren't supposed to carry girl's photographs around here. That sounds like something my mother would say. I guess you're right. But as long as you've mentioned it, can I see the photograph? Why do you want to see it? No particular reason. In other words, you're curious? I guess. All right. I'll let you look. It's over there. You sure it's okay? Wow... she's really beautiful. She's the reason I had to leave Shinsei Academy. You mean... you had a love affair? No, we just held hands. You... held hands? Her father was a teacher there... ...so he told the assistant principal I was worthless. And then I was expelled, and she was put in a monastery. How romantic! Do you still think about her? Not really. Are you sure? That's weak. I just think about Ponta's body. What's Ponta? She was a geisha on Awaji Island. You mean... You paid for a geisha? No! It would be embarrassing for a man like me to have to pay for a woman! Yeah, but didn't you just say she was a geisha? That doesn't mean I paid for her! Then, could you tell me the story? - You want all the details? - Yes. Well, what an adorable boy! Do you know me? I recognized you. You're the son of a well-to-do family in Kobe, right? You've been following us since there. That's right. I just came tonight for the Bon Festival Dance. How'd you like to meet me there in the evening? Really? Of course! What's with you? You'll understand later tonight. You will come, won't you? I want to change you. How could you keep me waiting? Oh, so you're a geisha? Did I surprise you? They call me "Ponta." Oh, Ponta? That's a funny name. My real name is Chiyo. Did you make your stage name youself? How old are you? Maybe slightly older than you are. It sounds like you're from the countryside. Yes, I come from a small town in Tokushima. Oh, it's all wet! Aren't you uncomfortable? You fell in the water, too. Let's go over there. You really are a remarkable one! I'm so sorry! Do I hear thunder? No, it's the night of the Bon Festival Dance, so the sky is clear. Let's dance and embrace and mess around until morning. Is this some old island custom? That's right. It's a very fun one. Hey, what about your previous arrangement? I wanted you, Bon-bon... ever since I first laid eyes on you. Are you a virgin? Ha! Me, a virgin? I'm very vigorous! This must be embarrassing. Get out of here! The moon is beautiful tonight. Since I don't have anyone yet, it's a good night to test him. That would make for a very happy evening. That boy doesn't know women. So when he touches my body, he'll become a man. [Japan's Imperial Anthem] How dull. Will you be scolded if you're late? They'll probably just come looking for me. How unreasonable. At any rate, love affairs are unreasonable. Do you get scolded for them? Yes. The headmistress will scold me and hit me. How cruel. Don't you want to sneak out every day? I've never even thought about it. I've wanted to be a geisha ever since I was a little girl. - You want to? - Yes. Some women are just destined to be geisha. I'll be one until I die. I see. Listen: I could tell right away you didn't love me. I could tell that there's someone you already like. But that's not a problem. What's this? Aren't you offended that you're just a fling? I don't take offense. I'm of the "flesh school." What's that? I sleep with men because I like them, for money, or because they're my patron. It's naive you'd think I would be so invested in you. There, now give me your hand. Hurry, Bon-bon! Come on! Why is it taking you so long? Get out! Ponta never talked to me again after that. And it's not that I loved her. But I learned from this experience that real love isn't just platonic, and it's not just about flesh, either. It's about the total unity of body and spirit. I'm not sure I do. I think I should go now. I think my head is about to explode. Oh, I almost forgot. -Where are you going? -Home. Is there a new student named Konno here? Who is it? It's you, isn't it? That's right. Come to the dojo after school. - You got it? - Yes. I think they're going to punish you. And so soon after you've transferred! It's no big deal. Name and rank! Third-year student, Class B, Akiyo Sai! - You were caught sleeping outside last night! - Yes! Come here! State your name and rank! Fourth-year student, Class C, Togo Konno! I understand you failed to greet an upper-classman properly. And that you behave cheekily as an underclassman! I am a new student, so I didn't realize that he was an upperclassman. Then you should recognize him by his badge. Didn't you see his lapel marked with a "5?" I saw it. If you saw it, why didn't you bow? He was hiding his face under his cap. I thought he might be a student from some other school. Does this school always punish new students for no reason? What did you just say? In that case, I'll be going. Hold it! We're not finished with you. Why do you always wear such fancy clothes and sandals? I wear them because my mother gave them to me. Aren't you just showing off your extravagance? That's just the way I was brought up. What did you say? This school has strict rules about what Western-style clothes can be worn, but they don't put any restrictions on Japanese-style clothes. Students should dress like students! When I went to Shinsei Academy, it wasn't a problem for me to dress like this. That was a weak school! Change your clothes! I don't have any other clothes. Would it be okay if I wore these clothes until I can get new ones? Well? What do we say? Absolutely not! In that case, I guess I can't come to school again until I have new clothes. May I receive a vacation to find new clothes from the Public Morals Bureau? Well? You've said enough already. THE RED ROOM by August Strindberg What is that book you're reading? It's a novel. What? You're reading a novel? Yes, I'm actually reading it. What's with this guy? Get him! Am I forbidden from reading novels? How impertinent! Students shouldn't read soft things like novels! What kind of novel is this? Strindberg. What? What the hell is that? You're supposed to be my upperclassmen! Doesn't it embarrass you that your lowerclassman knows more than you do? You say I can't read novels. Does that hold for all literature? You're such uneducated idiots, you would ban a world-renowned author you've never heard of? If it's serious literature, then it's okay. It's just those cheap romance novels that are forbidden. You think Strindberg is cheap? That's why we're asking you! - So you don't know? - That's right. In that case, I'll educate you. You're about to be educated, so sit down! Sit! You should study more. How could you let an underclassman like me bully and coerce you? And you're supposed to be the ones lording over underclassmen! It's so embarrassing. Would you like some? What is this? They're chocolates. Thank you Strindberg is an author who was born in 1849 in Sweden, in a place called Stockholm. "The Red Room" was his first novel, and it's a kind of satire. This Strindberg is responsible for many aspects of what we think of as the modern novel. He began as a naturalist, but he surpassed that and became a mysticist... And ended up writing psychological novels. So that's who he is. Do you understand now? Actually, it's a little confusing. That's right. This, too, is a novel. When you speak of novels unconditionally, you think of cheap literature, but that's not what real novels are. Some novels record real history... ...or they depict the bodies and souls of people, like all literature. Well, this has been enlightening. One day, I, too, will become a novelist. Really? You? There's nothing particularly mysterious about it. I suppose not. So look at this. If you ever again try to use collective violence against me, I'll defend myself. Got it? We've got it. You can read all the novels you want. You sure? Yes... we have to go now. What do you think, ma'am? I'm very good with these situations. ???? Oh, it's you. You're cutting classes too? Yes, I woke up late enough that I'd get in trouble... ...so I decided I might as well skip. Even the Public Morals Bureau does the same things we do. Please, don't say that. I quit the Public Morals Bureau. Why? After that time we went to your house, I decided I'd been wrong. Before that, I thought you were all bad. Well, I am. You weren't wrong about that. No you're not. I really admire you. You read difficult books, and because you come from a big city you're just different from us. Actually, I was thinking of visiting you tonight to have a talk with you. What kind of talk? I wanted to hear out your opinion... ...about my troubles. You have troubles? Yes. Actually, it's about love. Who's the girl? Who is she? She's the daughter of our tenant farmer. Oh, your family is a landlord? She's three years older than I am. Oh, and she's in love with you? No, I love her. I love her so much it makes me crazy. Love is a very difficult kind of happiness to find.. Thank you! I knew you'd understand. I know it only too well. You've loved her since you were a young boy. And she loved you too. But she couldn't be seen as seducing the young master of the landlord, so you had to be careful. But that left you unsatisfied, and so your love just became enflamed. That's it, isn't it? Yes, just as you've said. She tells you to come in the evening, and you furiously knock on her door. You embrace each other. What next? Then we kiss! - I see. - That's it! Yes. No one else is around, and she is assertive. Her lips roll up, so she kisses me. Then what happens? I don't do anything! We just talk and kiss until 12:30... Then I leave so no one would see me. She bids me farewell. The moon is as bright as midday. She sees me off. We don't say anything, but... I think she is burning inside. What should I do? Just love her. But isn't that wrong? Who are you afraid of, and what are you embarrassed about? This kind of romance is totally natural. Yes... you're right! This isn't something you need to worry about. Thanks. I feel a lot better after talking to you about it. Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Koishi, a fifth year student from Class A. Nice to meet you. What's wrong? That woman at the parasol shop is the spitting image of her. You don't say? By the way, how do you usually get away with cutting classes here? Just say you were sick. But won't I need a note from the doctor? That's easy. I just get one from Dr. Okamura. Dr. Okamura? Yes, he has the young daughter who's always playing the piano. Just ask him and he'll write it for you. I'll go there. Lets go together. Hey, wait up! I'll finally get to see Emiko's face! Don't be so careless! Lot's of people are always trying to peep at her, like Octopus! Yeah, but he's an idiot. Maybe so, but he's still obsessed with her. Are you looking for a medical certificate again? Yes, just something that says I needed to miss school. Okay. I'll write that you had enteritis. Thank you. Oh, it's you, the transfer student. Yes. My name is Togo Konno. I hear you're quite spoiled and uncontrollable. That's not true. Isn't it, though? You're already here to fake an illness so soon, after transferring schools. Yes, but if there's any way... I'll write that you had a nervous breakdown. A nervous breakdown? Why do you find that so funny? No. A modern illness like that is perfect. That's right. Big city types like you have nervous breakdowns all the time. So if I stay in a small town like this long enough, I'll be cured? That's right. Don't do it! The whole town will hear about it if you do! Come here. Emiko? You're Emiko, right? There you are. Where's your friend? Konno! What's wrong? All of the sudden, my gut started hurting. Oh, is this why you're missing school? No, we were dealing with his lovesickness. Strindberg "The Red Room". Wow, this is incredible. Lets hide under here. This is quite a heavy rainshower. You can come in to avoid getting wet! What should we do? We'll just stay here. - Come on in. - Thank you. Come here, Emiko! Wouldn't you like to come in? How are you liking "The Red Room?" I heard from the bookseller that you bought that book. What do you think of the author? Strindberg. If I have to choose, I hate him. I understand. He has a very bleak view of humanity. It gives me a funny feeling. Funny? I don't understand how he could hate people so much. Did you come home from school early today? No, I just skipped. I go there often enough that it doesn't matter if I miss a day or two. How unreasonable! You must think I'm bad. Of course I do! There isn't anyone in this little town for me to talk about literature with, and even at my old school, hardly anyone was interested. We're not so uncivilized here. You say that, but none of the teachers has even seen a steamship How can they be teachers? I've never seen one, either. Really? Since I come from Kobe, I grew up on boats. Kobe seems so wonderful. Yes. Ports are really wonderful places! You can just get on a boat to some country you've never seen or heard of... and people from other countries are visiting all the time. The young ones get drunk and sing songs from their home countries. That's nostalgia. Then they leave, and many of them never make it back. To be met again only in death. Everything changes in only a day. It's all fleeting. What a painful way to think. No, it's just, we may meet like this today, but... Shall we walk a little? When can I see you again? -This Sunday. -Promise? Hey! Konno! You need to be careful! What are you talking about? The Public Morals Bureau says they're going to get you. They say you've offended their sense of honor and they are going to punish you. Punish? What reason did they give? They say you're cheeky and you're disturbing the public morals by walking with a girl at night. Be careful! Wait, Marui! Not so loud! - I want you to take a message to them. - What message? Find out who saw me walking with a girl. I'll challenge him to a duel. A duel? "Octopus" Well, Konno. You said you wanted to see me. Hey, Octopus! What'd you call me? I dare you to say that again! Octopus! You idiot! You told everyone at school you were going to beat me up! I'd never let an idiot like you beat me up. Do you see this? What now? Do you know if I'm bad or not? You're the one who's bad. You let an underclassman beat you. Well, Susumura? I came here today to challenge you to a duel. A duel? Yes! We're both in love with Dr. Okamura's daughter Emiko. He really does move like an octopus! I can't stand it! Shall we postpone this duel for another time? - Yes. - All right, then, Susumura. Don't worry, you haven't lost yet. No, I surrender! No, I brought a dagger. It wouldn't be fair against someone with bare hands. If it bothers you, you can call on me with a dagger of your own at any time. Got it? Or are you willing to now? - No! - Well, in any case, I'll be waiting until you are! It's entirely up to you. If you don't want to, we won't have a duel. But if you want even after five years or more, I'll still be waiting. But until that day comes, you'd better leave the underclassmen alone. Got it? And now, get lost! What's that bell? The river is overflowing. So it's a warning? Who are they trying to warn? The people who live lower down, closer to the river. Like by the county offices? Yes. That area must be very dangerous now. Where are you going? Emiko! Let's get out of here! Hold on, everybody! Are you cold? I'll take you back to my house and dry you off. That seems risky. I don't want you to catch a cold. Was your house okay? It was fine. Even with the flood, there was no damage. Somehow or other, the shrine gate protects it. I can't seem to do this. That's okay. This is plenty warm. You have a unique smell. That bad? What do I smell like? -Here, have some. -Thank you. Wow, this view of the flood is incredible! You should be fine with this flock around. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have escaped my house. I'm surprised your father didn't come by. He's less worried about the house than the rest of the village. That's very neglectful. - It isn't even just that. - What else? He's always very lewd with the nurses. Oh, is that how he is? Excuse me... Could you spare a little water for my child? Thank you. Are you sure that's okay? We're going to need water. But the poor child! Let's share the blanket, Togo. KAISHI RYOKAN You two seem awfully bold today. How so? Today's Sunday! The Public Morals Bureau is sure to be prowling. But Sunday is the only day we can meet! It's one thing for you to meet at your own house But going boating together in public is too bold. But when Emiko comes to my boarding house these days, she always seems unhappy. It's not an issue for me, but she worries about it. Yoshie, I'm home. Mother! This is Togo Konno. Welcome Togo is always teaching us interesting cultural things. That's good. But this is a small town, and word will get around about a young man visiting two young girls like this. Here: enjoy these. Do you think it's okay, Yoshie? Is what okay? With your mother talking to you like that... aren't we imposing on you? Don't worry. My mother may be a widow, but she's very understanding. - That's good. - That's very nice, but are you sure? What are you saying? We're your allies in this house! From now on, it might be best if you just met here. Thank you. -I should be going now. -Why are you going, Yoshie? Do you mind if I borrow this? How generous! What are you thinking about? Are you thinking about what we were talking about earlier? What talk was that? That I'm going to visit my Aunt in Kyoto next week. I remember that. Then, is it okay with you? No. Don't go to Kyoto. - You don't want me to go no matter what? - That's right. You're mean. What kind of person is she? Leave me alone I was just kidding. Let's go to Kyoto together Really? This is wonderful! No! Why not? We love each other. Please, Togo. KYOTO It's so quiet here. Yes. It's a good feeling. But we're going to need to visit your aunt soon, aren't we? I can't bear to separate from you... let's get married. I'll go with you wherever you want to go. At some point I can leave school. Try not to be so unreasonable. I can endure anything for your sake. Getting sent to Toyooka was like a banishment for me. It must have been, after such an amazing port town like Kobe. Yes. I'd been hoping to go to Tokyo, but... even in a gloomy town like Toyooka, I was able to find a diamond like you. What a pity that it was a black diamond you found. - Where should we go today? - Anywhere. What a wonderful set of circumstances. We don't look like students at all. - I'm a man now! - But you seem just like a child in some ways. You're neither a man nor a boy. Where is your mother's grave? In Toyooka, of course. At the family temple. You come from a noble family too, then. She was very nice. She died of lung disease when I was 12. She was very kind all the way until she died. I also have a very weak constitution, and sometimes... I just think that since everyone dies anyway, and that when I die I'll get to see my mother... You should give up that wish. I'll be in charge now. I'll look after you until I die. Do you want to meet with your mother? - Not really. - Why not? She's very cold, and only cares about appearances. Her only hope for her children is that they become rich or famous. I'm nothing but a big nuisance to her. It seems unlikely that I'll ever become a respectable person. My grades are bad and I got thrown out of Kobe. I like literature, though, so maybe I can become a third-rate writer. I don't think I could become a real scholar of literature. Of course if it were up to my mother, I'd be a diplomat. But that wouldn't work for me at all. Whatever I do, I have to do it with my own skill. I think you can do whatever you want. - I'm not so sure. - I am! In any case, literature is important for everyone, smart and stupid. I could never write literature for smart people, so I'll write literature for idiots. That's awfully eccentric. No, it's perverse. I don't know if I'm amazed or disgusted. We're pulling in to Toyooka. I'm troubled. By what? If my father wrote to my aunt in Kyoto and discovers I didn't visit her, I'll be in deep trouble. What do we do now? Let me think. Why don't we ask Yoshie? I'm sure she'll help us. You can say that you ended up traveling with her instead. Your father will believe that. I suppose so. But this is so embarrassing. I don't want to ask Yoshie to do that for me. I see. I'll ask her to do it as a favor for me, then. That's Konno, isn't it? Without a doubt. And that was Dr. Okamura's daughter Emiko with him. This is big. Go get the others: we'll confront them together. I see. Well, I can look after you today. But why didn't you tell me earlier? I was worried about you. In any case, you can relax here now. It's a great help. But what will you do after today, Emiko? After she graduates, we'll go to Kyoto and live together. I always thought I'd move to Tokyo, but I think I could get along in Kyoto, or she could get along in Tokyo. We're still communicating about that. We owe you so much, Yoshie. We've got a problem. What is it? The students from the Public Morals Bureau are gathering. They're coming here? The landlady is keeping them at the gate. Don't worry. I'll go look. Your "Public Morals Bureau" may have permission from the school But that doesn't give you the right to barge in on boarding houses or hotels. If you come in, I'll have to hold you responsible for any damaged or lost items. - What do you mean "lost items"? - You think we're thieves? Can you blame me, when you show up at night like this? We won't go to anyone else's rooms. Just Konno's. If Mr. Konno has done nothing wrong, you'll have to be punished for your false accusation. We haven't accused him of anything. Then what do you want with him? We're just investigating as the Public Morals Bureau. Investigating without cause? That's an infringement. You're not only trespassing, but also impeding our business. By showing up and trying to barge in so late at night, you are embarrassing us. So please: don't bother us further and go home. Good work, mom! Maybe so, but your friends should leave soon. We know you're there, Konno. Come out right now! I can't believe we let a middle-aged-woman beat us! And Konno is right there under our noses! Emiko, your father's here! Hide quickly, Konno! Don't worry! Leave him to me! Quickly, Emiko, sit down! Emiko! We're going home now! Come along now. I'm very sorry, but I must ask that after today you not allow my daughter in here. Wait! You! I'm the one who was with Emiko. We love each other! Please, let us get married. What kind of talk is this? To think I'd let you marry her! If not now, then in the future! Absolutely not. Not now or in the future. You have to restrain yourself. In any case, that was very brave of you. Just try to think things over. Yes. I'll get ready. The Red Room So she's been locked in her room this whole time? So it seems. There has to be some way you can help me communicate with her. Not anymore. I can't talk to her myself even. And besides, this is all your fault. You so enraged Emiko's father that he's probably complaining to the school principal now. You're right. Let's go, Konno. Hurry up, Konno! Konno, what are you doing? Now we have proof of you meeting with a female student in secret! What's that supposed to mean? It means we've caught you by your tail! I guess that means you've won. That's right. Now we have good reason to punish you. I'm sorry for this, Yoshie, but you should probably leave now. Let her through! It's going to be more difficult to punish me than you seem to think. And why's that? The Public Morals Bureau only has authority over students at your school. So what? You're a student, so we can still punish you, at school or not. Does that include former students who've left school? See here. I'm carrying my notice of dismissal. And since I'm not a student, you aren't my seniors anymore. I'll take you down one by one. Be careful! He has a sword. I don't need to put up with your rudeness any longer. So let's have a talk. A talk? We'll settle this once and for all. You've just forgotten your place as a student! That's just a difference of opinion. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? It's just a fundamental difference of opinion. That's not how we see it! There's no use in arguing about it. I've been dismissed from school. I have no relationship with you any longer. Hold it! You've defiled our school's name! Teacher! Emiko! Togo! Let's go! Don't worry about it! What's happened, all of the sudden? I've been ordered to leave school. It's just like I wanted. Your father went and complained to the school principal. Then I accidentally struck the principal in a fight. The principal whose care you were left in? Will you send me letters? But your replies will all be confiscated. I'll write to you anyway. Once you graduate, you'll go to college. You'll go to Kyoto or Tokyo. And that's where we'll meet again. Let me look at your face again. We don't have to wait. Let's go to Tokyo together. No? Forgive me! Farewell. What do you plan to do about that troublesome boy you've taken into your care and exposed my daughter to? I do feel responsible. Is that all you have to say? You'll have to do better than mere words! Also... That low, bad-boy Togo Konno has soiled the name of a noble family! Hold on a minute. His family's name is also noble. Are you telling me that vulgar boy comes from a high family? How can you be so sure that he made the first move? ??? You think my daughter would want to be with that worthless boy? It's like I just explained it. Both parties are to blame. How dare you! Take this as an admonition. You're just trying to pass the blame off onto me! Before you arrived, you already knew what I said yourself. Mr. Konno! The principal is here to see you. Have you finished packing? - Yes. - That was fast. I beg your pardon. I was the one who determined your punishment. I am prepared. Whenever there is someone in need of defense, I always do my best. But the decision was unanimous. In my case, it was justified. Is that what you think? Yes. I've caused you so many problems. When do you leave? Tomorrow. I'll be going to Tokyo. You aren't getting help from your mother? That's right. I'm prepared. There are some things people can only do when they're young. Some things you can do at 20, you won't be able to do in fifteen or twenty years. You must think of this as you acquire the annual tree rings of your life. Do not despair. In the end, I wasn't able to do very much for you. Consider these words a parting gift. Thank you. ONE YEAR LATER TOKYO Okay, that's enough! THE RED ROOM Are you all right, young man? It looked like that was your own fault; you were the first to take your hands out. They were looking for a fight. You should be careful not to provoke ill-mannered workers like that. Here's what I owe you for dinner. Will you be okay? It's not such a big deal. Take care of yourself. Hey, old man! - Who's that guy? - Some night school student that comes here for food on occasion. I think he's studying literature. Whoever he is, he seems to be strong-willed. I'm sorry to write this so suddenly, but we have very sad news to deliver to you. It's about Emiko. She'd been under treatment at Kyoto University Hospital, and after some improvement went to the coast near Mt. Hiyori for a change of scenery. But on the 29th of last month, her illness suddenly took a turn for the worse, and she passed away. She knew about her illness when you left for Tokyo, and thought hard about whether to go with you or not. Afterwards, she kept asking herself why she didn't go with you. What was the age of the deceased? As Togo thought about life, the young Togo realized that it was a bitter thing. However, as long as he had the passion to pursue the truth, he would survive and wouldn't lose hope. In any case, Togo realized that the long and distant journey of his life had only just begun.
