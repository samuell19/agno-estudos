- Go around back. Look up. - You sons of bitches! Woo! It's your lucky day, man. - Give me the money, home boy. Give me the money now. - It's collection time, Charlie. Collection time. Yeah, you motherfucker! Yeah. Look at you, you old piece of shit. - Stay awake while we're killin' this guy. I pulled out, and you hit my car. - Hey cabby, 20 bucks you get us out of here. Thanks, man. - I'm gonna call the police. - Charlie? Hey, Charlie. Geez, Charlie, what happened? - Paul, take care of my things will you? Until I get back. - Move and you're dead, asshole. - He's dead. The son of a bitch killed him. Get him out of here. Come on, come on, let's go come on. Come on, let's go. - Come on. Move it. Get in there. - Come on, Kimball, you did it. We know you did it. You know we know you did it. No bruises, see? - Hey, you want a glass of water? Huh? You can't have it. - Not 'til you tell us what we wanna know. Chief. - Who's this dude? - Mr. Kimball here doesn't want to talk. - Leave. Kimball, is it? Son of a bitch. I'll be a son of a bitch. It's not Kimball. I know you. Kersey. It's Paul Kersey. You see, I was with the New York PD the night they brought a vigilante in with a bullet in his leg. You were out like a light. It's been 10 years. Mr. Vigilante. The last damn thing I need is a vigilante. Dude, you're in big trouble. What were you doing up in that area? East New York on Belmont. - I was visiting a friend. - Well maybe you did it. Probably not. - I found him that way and I'm no more Mr. Vigilante. - Well, what I do with you, dude? - I don't know, but I want a lawyer. - No, you don't. Roaches. I hate 'em. Maybe I should have you killed. Who's gonna complain? - You always violate people's constitutional rights? - This is my jail, Kersey, and I'm the law. That means I get to violate your constitutional rights. - Son of a bitch! - Go on! - Come on tough guy. Come on. Hey, watch it, buddy. - And forget bail! And watch him and make sure he doesn't get comfortable! - Hey chief, you all right? Get in there. - Lookin' for trouble, man? You fucker! - I tore it out. Motherfuckin' thick head between the two bars. Talk about gettin' shit faced. Great, look at that. - Hey Beadle, coffee. - I wanna move on that one in the corner. Get him, get him! - Hey man, I always win. Come on! Come on, you, come on. Get in there! - Fraker. You're being released. Five minutes. - See, I got a lawyer. But I gotta tell ya, if they hadn't of broken us up, I would've killed you. Next time, you won't even see me coming. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna kill a little old lady, just for you. Catch it on the six o'clock news. You got some free time on your hands, come on up to Sutter and Belmont. That's my turf. So long, asshole. - You're out, but it's gonna take them a couple of hours to put the papers through. - Two more hours in this fuckin' pit? Sure. Whatever you say. - Shriker. Inspector Shriker, what are you doing with this prisoner Kimball? - Keeping him in jail. - Well there's nothing been set here. What's the bail? - Bail? There is no bail. - What are the charges? - There are no charges. - Are you out of your mind? You're violating all his rights. What the hell do you think you're doing? He'll sue. He's got a case, you know. - Not likely. - Who is Kimball? You're going to have to let him out. - Stay out of this one, Ms. Davis. Three murders, four rapes, eight muggings, nine acts of random violence. Some of the most orderly drug traffic in the city. More robberies than I care to mention. Broken storefront windows, fire bombings, all this within a six square block area of Sutter and Belmont. I could qualify that as a riot. This isn't a neighborhood. It's a war. What are we doing about that Captain Stems? - Well, we know it's gang related. We put more uniformed officers out, put more cars on patrol. We increased our real effort 15 % in the last month. - And tell us the results? - Reported crime is up 11 %. - Let's you and I have a talk. Leave him with me. So how you feeling, Kersey? Smoke? Where have you been recently, Kersey? - In the country, havin' a rest. - You see, Kersey, I admire you. I'm a real fan. Even kept the folder on you. Truth is, I hate creeps too, but I can't do much about it. I'm a cop. But you, you shoot 'em right? I have a theory. If I'm right, you turned pro, went to LA. Six creeps shot in 36 hours. Then four gang members in Kansas city. Two mugger rapists in Chicago. - Like I said, I was through with all of it. - Really? Then why are you here? - Well, it's a great city. I missed it. - All right. You want something in this Berg? Have it. It's on me. You want out of here? You got it. I'll minimize the vigilante stuff with the press. Tell 'em it's creeps gettin' creeps. Nobody cares anyway. It'll be just like before, Mr. Vigilante, with with one important difference: you're going to work for me. Do your thing, but you report to me. You tell me what's going on. You tell me everything that you're even thinking of doing. Let us get some busts. It's that, or I'll keep you here 'til hell freezes over. Do we understand each other? Are you in? Cross me, and I'll bury you so deep, they'll never find the bones. - You're letting me loose? I'm letting you loose. - What about the gun? - The gun? I didn't see any report of a gun. Did you? If there was a gun, I'd have to charge you with possessing a firearm. They're illegal in the city. - He's free to go, but he's gotta see the public defender. - Davis. The public defender is arranging your release. It's going to take a while. You sit out there and wait. - Kimball. Watch it. There's a new breed on the streets. - Quit now, I'm not here. - This is a nice haul, Chaco. Very good, very good. Good Chaco. - Hector, are you allowed to... - I'll tell you what to do and when to do it. Understand? We'd didn't think we'd see you out so soon. Hey man, it's good to see ya. I've just been taking care of a little business, you know? - I can see that. - You said I should. - Did I? - Shit. - What the fuck, man? - This is a sticker, Hector. And you're the stickee. - No! Well aren't you gonna welcome me back? - Mr. Kimball. Kathryn Davis, public defender's office. You're being released now. I'm sorry it took so long. - Thanks, Ms. Davis. - You're just going to walk away? - Yup. - I don't understand. You have cause to press charges. Sue. - Ms. Davis, it's all right. - You don't wanna do anything? - Told you no. - Well I'm sorry, I don't understand. - Goodbye, Ms. Davis. - Well wait, here's my number in case you should change your mind. - Thanks, Ms. Davis. - Is there some place I can get a hold of you? I need something, Mr. Kimball, for the release form. - Yo, bitch, come here, I wanna eat you. I'm gonna lick you all over. I'm comin' for you, bitch. Come here, I wanna eat you. Come on, come on. Come on bitch, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get out the fuckin' car, come on! Come on, lady. Get out of the car. You're mine, now, bitch, and I'm gonna fuckin' kill you! - Hey. Be right down. Who are you? - I was Charlie's friend. - Me, too. You must be Paul. - Yeah. - I'm Bennett. Charlie spoke about you all the time. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Come on. They broke that yesterday. Well, it's the neighborhood. And you missed the funeral. It was a nice funeral, as far as funerals go. That's Charlie and me in World War ll. I knew Charlie, oh, 40 years. Charlie says that he met you during the Korean war. - Yeah. I was a conscientious objector. But, he didn't agree with that. But we got along all right. As a matter of fact, we got to be very good friends. Kept in touch with one another over the years. - We lived a few blocks from here. When my wife died, I moved over here and believe it or not, this was a pretty good neighborhood until it changed. - I got a letter from Charlie a few days ago. He was really scared. - They didn't like him, the bastards, so they killed him. - Who killed Charlie? - The creeps on the street. He wouldn't take any of their lip, he wouldn't pay them. He said he was going to do something about it. - Pay? Like in protection? - Protection, robbery, theft, your money or your life. They hit the old people up here in the projects. You know what goes on out there is a disgrace. - Now wait a minute. Who killed Charlie? - I'll show you. Those three. I saw them running away from the building when Charlie got killed. - Their faces are painted. - Well, they belong to the same gang. Oh, we got hell here. They say it's their turf. And see him? - Yeah. What about him? - Well he runs the gang, and he's the worst. He's been away. I don't know where. Looks like you could just go up and smash him in the face, doesn't it? Well, can't be done. - What do you mean? - He's got guys watching all over. I saw a guy try to reach him once, they chopped him to pieces before he got six feet. - Is it worth living here like this? - You mean move? Everybody who can has. Me? I got nowhere to go. I fix clocks, meters, for the cab company. I got a little place down the street. That's what I do. - I'm not gonna get run out of here. Are you going to go back where it came from? - Bennett. When I got to Charlie's apartment, he was still alive. - Did he say anything? - Yeah, he said, "Take care of my things until I get back." - I've got the keys to his apartment. The rent is paid 'til the end of the month. Well, they've cleaned up. They've dusted for prints, and they're already through with their investigation. Cops don't care. Well? - Like you said, the rent is paid until the end of the month. - Goodnight. See you in the morning. Lock your door. Bitch, get over here now! I'm talkin' to you! - The Giggler. That's his name. He laughs when he runs. Nobody catches him. - Jesus, he really moves. Tell me about him. - Well, he killed a girl last month. Put a knife in her skull doing that. - How do you know it was him? - It was him. - Bennett said we can come up and ask. Were you downstairs last night in the underground garage? - Yeah. - Oh, thank you. - For what? - My wife, Maria. She was in the car last night. - Ah, I see. - You helped her? - Yeah. - I'm Rodriguez. We live downstairs. - You were a friend of Charlie's? - Yeah. - You're a man who doesn't run. Hey, if there's anything I can do to help, huh? - What about the cops? They do anything? - Yeah, they enforce the parking laws. - Yes. Thank you. Well, my friend Wildey's coming. He'll help us. - Who's Wildey? - Oh you'll see. - Where are you going? - You just take it easy, Bennett. This is my problem. I'd like to rent a box for a month. - B21. - Okay. This car. - How are you going to pay for it? Cash. - What's that for? The new car? - That's bait. When I was coming through the lobby, I smelled something cooking, it smelled great. - It was probably coming from the Kaprov's apartment on the first floor. - Kaprov's? - Yeah. I'll introduce you, come on. Well these are the Kaprov's. This is Eli, Erica. This is Mr. Kersey, he's now in apartment 2C, and he was admiring your dinner. - Stuffed cabbage. - Smells wonderful. - Would you like to join us? - Sure. Can I have a few minutes to clean up? - Oh, certainly. - Okay. I'll be right back. - Nice man. - Mhm. - My sister said know him? I married him in 1971. Come on, let's get the fucking car open! I aint got all day. - Excuse me, please. Hey. What's the problem? - What? - With the car. What's the problem? - Just get outta my fucking face. Who are you? - We're stealin' the fucking car. What's it to you? - It's my car. - Now you gonna die. - We heard shots. What happened? - I sent them a message. Fuck him up, yeah. You're out of your area. - Yeah, this is our turf, man. - Hurt him. Kill him. - Gentlemen, the streets are full of degenerates, killing each other indiscriminately. Arrest them. Your guys aren't pussies, are they Sterns? - Chief? - I want some arrests, felony arrests, and a couple of buddies on slabs in the morgue. They can be your guys' bodies or some of that trash up there. Get that? - Hey. What the fuck are you lookin' at? Hey. Lend me five dollars, man. Hey, I said lend me five dollars, sucker. - No. - Hey! - Yeah! Right on, man. - You all right? - Yeah. Thanks, sir. You all right? - Who is this man? We need him. - Emil, Mr. Kersey, our new neighbor in 2C. - I'm very pleased to meet you. Oh, this is my wife, Martha. - So nice to meet you. - That's him. The man in black. - He's on my turf. I'll take care of him. - Yes? - You Charlie's friend? Guy in 2C? - Yes. What are you doing in there? - I'm taking care of Charlie's things, that's what I'm dong here. - Ah, Charlie don't need no help. He's dead, just like you're gonna be. I'm watching you. - Well, what do you think of the neighborhood? - I thought you said I was to be here on my own? - You're right. I think I said that. Look, I'd like somethin'. For the papers. You give me a bust. I'll send in a tactical squad, they'll grab a headline. What do you say? - Can't help you. - Nothing happened, huh? I don't know anything. Yeah, Kersey. - Oh, I do know one thing. Fraker is the chief creep around here. Why don't you bust him? - He's got a cleaner arrest record than you. Perfect citizen. When he does something, he does it privately. - Like I said, I can't help you. - Shit man, I'm hurt. - Son of a bitch. - What is this, man? - We got to turn the screws on them, motherfuckers. - Give me some money, woman. - What for? - Protection from creeps who live around here. - You're the creep. Hey. Get out of my way. I've had enough of you creeps. - What are you doing up here? - Looking for you. - How did you find me up here? - I decided if I waited to hear from you, I never would. Oh, Shriker was no help. I read the arrest report and made a calculated guess. I was right. You live here, don't you? - Yeah, uh, Ms... Davis. - Davis. - I told you before, I'm not going to file any charges. - Would you like to have dinner? - What? - Well, I'm not usually this bold taking a taxi to some place I think someone might not be to ask them out, but, why not? How many people do I meet in my job who I can ask out to dinner? - Look around. You shouldn't be up here. It's not safe. - Oh, nonsense. I'm a city girl. Come on, do me a favor. Say yes. So I can get out of here without being mugged. - Okay, all right. When? - Friday? - Friday? Friday's good for me. - My place. I live in a basement. It's a nice basement. What are you doing up here? - Friend of mine was killed. Trying to find out what happened. - Why? There's nothing you can do. - Oh, I'll put it in a book I'm writing. Look, your meter's running. I'll see you Friday. - Friday. Thank you. - Come on, mister. You were brandishing a gun. - What do you mean brandishing? Some kids tried to come in my back window. I waved it at 'em. What should I have done? - The complaints were that you were brandishing a firearm, mister. - Complaints? Who? - That's none of your concern, sir. Can we have the gun? Possession is a felony in the city limits. If you surrender the weapon, we'll forget it happened. Otherwise, you go to jail. - Eli. Give him the gun. - Erica, it's our protection. - Please. - Thanks, mister. - Listen! We'll come in here any time we like, you got that, pops? Any time! - The first floor is the worst, but they come in wherever they want from the fire escapes. They're roof rats. - It's 90 degrees outside and I've had my windows nailed shut. I'll take care of it, but I'll need a few things first. This is how it works. I put a nail in the window right here. Anybody opening the window raises the nail... - What are you doing? - Thinning the herd. - Hey. I wanna make a house call, man. I'm a little short on cash. - For 20 minutes, you play. Then you all go out to work. - Mr. Bennett, I know you like a hot sauce. - Yes, I do. - What are those? - Teeth. APB, theft at 121 Sutter. Suspect is described as Latino, about 5'6", missing two front teeth. - This Wildey friend of yours, can he catch this guy? - Well who's Wildey? - You'll see. Wildey's here. Fires a .475 Wildey Magnum. Real stopping power. - Is that like a .44 Magnum? - No a .44 Magnum is a pistol cartridge. The .475 Wildey Magnum is a shorter version of the African big game cartridge. Makes a real mess. - Yeah, woo! - What are you two doing here, huh? What are you, a couple of perverts? Come on, get the fuck out of here. - Open the door, open the door. - Come on. - Open the door. No, no! Let's go, drive! - Raped her. They raped her. - Bennett, get a taxi. - Aye, Maria. - Thanks. They say she'll be all right. Just has a broken arm. I'll take you to the hospital, come on. It'll be all right, Manny. Baptist Medical Center. Dr. Appleburn, to the emergency room, stat. - The doctor's in here. - Mr. Rodriguez? - How is my wife? Can I see her? - Mrs. Rodriguez has expired. Jesus. Over the phone they told me she had just a broken arm. - The arm was badly injured. There were broken blood vessels, some clots came free and we think lodged in the heart. I'm sorry. - It's no good, the light's no good. No ID you gentlemen make is gonna stand up in a court. - You load the shells yourself? - Nothing's too good for our friends. The action of this weapon is adjustable depending on the charge in the cartridge. Well, think I'll go down the street and get myself some ice cream. This is America, isn't it? - Thanks! - How much do I owe ya? Oh, would you look at the fucker with the ice cream? - Oh my lord. It's the creep that stole my pocketbook three weeks ago. - All right, all right. - Good shot. - Yes! Hey! - They killed the Giggler, man. They killed the Giggler! - They had no business doing that. None. - It's the new man. The one from the jail. - That would be smart. No, not too smart. Come on, you all, let's move it back. Move it back. Make way. - Where you been? You're never here when we need you. It's about time. I'm glad he's dead. He took my pocketbook three weeks ago. He should've been dead! I'm glad he's dead! You lousy cops never get here on time! - Hi, kid. - Hello, chief. Christ. There's not much left of this sucker, is there? So how are things around here? - Better. I feel more relaxed. It's gotten quiet around here. Our efforts must be having a positive effect on the community. We're getting fewer complaints. I wouldn't let it go to your head, Patrolman Renzo. - Looked like a rifle bullet. Witnesses say the shot came from the corner of that block. - The guy was a good shot. - Better than anyone in our department. - Hello. - Hello. The guy at the store said this wine is very good. - Great, I'll open it. I made chicken. I hope you like it. It's the only thing I know how to make. - Chicken's good. I like chicken. - I have one sister. She live in Binghamton, New York and I hate her. But I love sports, basketball and football on TV. What do you like? - I like opera. - Opera? - It's restful. - I don't know anything about you. Married? Children? - I was married, but my wife died. - I'm sorry. - Sorry, that was years ago. What about you? - Am I right? I guessed that you're afraid to be close to someone again. - Oh, maybe. You like the kind of work you do? - Most of the time. No. Sometimes I feel like I'm on the wrong side. Defending creeps. Don't take that personally. You're gentle, but I've seen a lot of gentle people get hurt. Dammit, people have got to start to fight back and hard. The whole thing is just, it's out of balance. - Some people would say that was an extreme position. - I don't care. I bet you never get mad. I'm sorry. Why am I angry at you? Tell me, you don't really like opera, do you? - No. Oh, it's late. I gotta go. - No, it's early. - Believe it or not, an unemployed writer has to work. I really gotta go. - Well, see you again? - Yep. - Cuban's gonna get high. Go ahead, it's speed. Yeah, Cuban's gonna get high, high high! - No needles, man. - If I want you to shoot it, I'll tell you. Just snort it. I don't want you flat on your ass. Cuban's gonna kill tonight. - Hit him off. Get 'round back. - He's all yours. Go get him. Police tried to control. Request ambulance to 673 Belmont. Advise, we have a dead body at the crime scene. Send the meat wagon to 673 Belmont. - Let's talk. Try and take it easy for a couple of days, will ya? Coroner's shop is going out and hiring extra help. People are starting to get a line on you. He isn't finished. It isn't finished. It's like killing roaches. You have to kill them all, otherwise what's the point? - Hi, is this Mr. Emil? - Yes. Yes. - Hey, it's your wife. I think she needs your help. She's sick or something. - Who is this? What do you mean? - Hey, you be nice now. I think you'd better be here, at home. - Who is this? - You threw one of my boys out of your store last week. It's your wife, she's done. - Hello? - You see what you've done? You got me mad. Fuck it. - It's me he wants, you know. How's Emil? - Forget Emil. Emil is done for. He'll never be the same again. 20 years. 20 years, nobody ever did a thing like that to me, break my windows. Well I say fuck 'em. I've had it. And Charlie said the same thing too, and he was right. Well, he was afraid he was going to use them. Well, he should have used them. Instead he gave 'em to me to keep. The next time they come around, I've got something for them. - What? - I'll show you. That's a .30 caliber Browning machine gun. Charlie brought them home from the war, and they still work. - Jesus. This ammunition any good? - You're damn right. You could shoot some nice, big holes in the sons of bitches. Now they call us the old people. We were running the world 20 years ago. What do you say? - Ah, Bennett, a lot of people could get hurt. It's me he wants. This is his turf. If I leave, he wins. - Well you want that? - Maybe it'll save a lot of people from getting killed. Do me a favor, Bennett. Name it. - Don't use those guns. Give me a day to get Fraker. - Whatever you say. I was just trying to help. - Hi. Well, you said it was important. - Thanks for coming. Come on in. I'm leaving the city. - What? - A couple of weeks with my sister in Binghamton, and I'll do whatever I have to not to be here. Oh, it's everything. This place, my job, the people I deal with. I just wanted to see you one more time. - I didn't think you wanted to leave this city. - Do you still think you don't want to get close to someone? - You know, my wife didn't just die. She was murdered, and they never caught the people who did it. And my daughter... Anyway, something in me changed. - Does it have to be that way forever? - No. - Why don't you come with me? At least visit. You don't have to be here. - I could do that. - I bet you want to leave. All you need is an excuse. I'll bet you're right. I'm hungry. How about you? - I'm starved. I know a good restaurant. - Is it open late? - They sure are. - Here he is, they're going. Don't lose 'em. - Be right back, I'm gonna pick up my mail. - I'll be right here. Come on! Somebody call the ambulance. - My people are looking for you up there, when you shot the punk. I have a description. You were eating an ice cream. So you better take it easy for a few days, for your own damn good. - I have places I'm supposed to be. - That's why you're not gonna be there. When he comes out, take him into protective custody. Come on, pal, you're comin' with us. Come on. - Come on, mister. Let's move it. Come on, let's get in the car. - That's my shop! My shop! My shop! Come back, just stay back, just stay back, come on. Move it, move it. - My shop, my shop! My shop. Kersey. Kersey! I'll give you something to screech about you sons of bitches. Those goddamn hooligans. Damn you. Where is he? He's not where he should be. Run, he's got a gun! It's not working. Kill the motherfucker! Man, can you hear me? Oh my god. - Hey, you wanna tell Shriker I'd like to talk to him? - Well he don't wanna talk to you. He told me so, personally. - There's a man in the hospital. He was beaten. He says he'll identify his assailants but only if he could talk to you. Bennett Cross. He was armed with a machine gun. Dr. Hernandez, Dr. Hernandez. Please call your office. - Thank you, nurse. Dr. Hernandez, Dr. Hernandez. Please call your office. - How is he? - Well, he's a tough bird. There are a couple of bad fractures, but I think he's gonna make it. - Is it all right if I go in and see him? Okay? - I screwed up. I'm sorry. - It's all right. - Listen, Kersey. I only lost one gun through that. The other one's still there, in the same place. Blow the scum away. Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please. - He had to go some place. Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair, Dr. J Hamilton, Dr. J Hamilton. - Taxi! - Hey, you wanna take this? - Hey, I saw you come into the building. - Used to be Charlie's. - He's back, man. He picked up some packages and he's back at the apartment. - Move. Yeah. Manny Fraker here. Listen, I need some more guys, as many as you can spare me. I need to put some more heat in my area. Yeah, thanks. - What is it? - It's a LAWS missile launcher. Anti-tank, anti-personnel weapon. And these rounds? They're self propelled. Armored piercing. The round arm is three feet out of the barrel. Won't do me much good, though, unless I can get 'em bunched. - All I got is a zip gun. - Well, we should get a few of them. - All right! - Guys, come on. - Eli, it's Mr. Kersey. He just shot some of the creeps. - Who the hell is firing, man? You told someone to fire? Come on, you guys. We're gonna get those motherfuckers. - We're outta ammo. Air unit six to base, be advised. Around the center of Belmont in a 15 block area, I've cited several buildings burning. Be advised, we have shots fired in the street. Looks like we have a riot on our hands. We need every back up unit available in the area. More money for them, said the mayor. News is coming in of riots in east New York. - I can't see anything. - Come here, dear, we can watch it on television. - Police are converging there now. And our helicopter is overhead with Roy Baxter to bring you an on the sport report. - Hey, have you seen the man? - I haven't seen shit, man. Throughout this vast area of derelict buildings and waste lots, I can see- - Hey, we're on TV, man. Scattered shots as groups run and hide in alleys and damage department buildings. There are great sheets of flames rising from burning buildings. The fire department is there, but the buildings are collapsing. I can see fires over 20, maybe 30 blocks. In some streets, police cars seem to be fighting a hail of bullets as they try to get into the area. There are gangs of motorcycles down there gathering together now. And all backed by gunfire and flames and smoke. It's a hell of a mess here. We've had no official word from the police department yet, but we'll be back with you as soon as we can find out what caused this. - Oh, boy. - Get 'em. Kersey, look out. - I'm out of shells. I'll go get some. - I owed you that one, dude! - Well now I owe you. How bad is it? - It's just a nick. - I'll call an ambulance. - Hey. Bulletproof, asshole. Just like yours. Stay just like that. - You can't have both of us. - Maybe. What did that? Get outta here! Okay, looks like I'm over Belmont and Sutter now. Crowd seems to be breaking up quite a bit. - Better get going. I'll buy you a few minutes. Get outta here. They'll be after you.
