- Come on. - Here, can you get him? All right, Peggy, that's right. Got home early. Peter was through early. Oh, honey, let me see your face. - There, there, that's better. - Mama. Got nobody to play with. Everybody's at camp but me and that stupid Jane. You know you're going to camp soon as Peter finishes the book. I know. Look what he gave me. Daddy! - Hi. - Hi, honey. Peggy, come up and take care of your fish. Have you washed yet? Sure, I'm watering my fish already. Well, don't make the water too hot this time. I won't. Peggy, found a couple new matchbooks for your collection. Gotta stay in your places, boys. All the others have to do it, so do you, so do you, so do you. Did you tell aunt Judy camp's been postponed for a couple of weeks? Come on, Bobby. Bobby. Ooh. Got to put your water in. You know what? Jamie was teasing me again today. What'd I tell you to do when she starts that? - Ignore her. - And why? 'Cause she's an unhappy little girl. Do you know what I told her? I told her she was a liar, because I really do have a father, only he's dead. - Goodnight, darling. - 'Night, mama. Do Dee do Dee Clementine do Dee do Dee Clementine Peggy, go do that in the bathroom. I bet you don't know I'm a model now, like my mother. Since when? Hey, kid, you're dripping. - Look. - She's half right, Carol. She's not actually a professional model, but, a photographer's doing a kids' picture book with her and well, she's having a wonderful time with him. Who are you going out with? Old friend. Old, old friend. Name's Larry. Do I know Larry? No. Well, if he's an old, old friend, how come I don't know him? Cause I knew him a long, long time ago. I got a piece of a puzzle that will, will not fit I've got a piece of a puzzle - You know where you wanna eat? - You pick the spot. It's your choice tonight. Okay, I'll pick the spot. Carol, you won't forget to turn off Peggy's light? I won't. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. You did, you did! Oh, Peggy, stand still. But, it's in my eyes! Don't you want to look nice for Larry? Where are we going? Central park. We may even go to the museum for lunch. All done. Hi, Larry. Hi. Oh, what a beautiful Rose. Larry, this is Peggy. Well, hello, Peggy. Wonder what's in that package. That is a present for Peggy. Ooh, thank you. You're very welcome. Mama, look. Peggy, let's go inside. Peggy, it's too hot for games. You go inside and cool off. - I'll get her, okay? - Okay. - M-u-s... - Peggy, let's go in. E-u-m. Peggy, let me check the boat inside. No. Well, they won't allow you to take it in. You can't sail a boat in a museum. Maybe I can. Wait till we get to central park. They don't have any lakes in here. Well, they ought to. Where'd ya go? Oh, we were just looking at pictures. Well, why didn't you check it in the first place? Maybe I should've tied a string to her, too. Look, she's more interested in the motor boats now anyway. You know, parts of south America are just fabulous, but there's no place like New York City. Gonna go back? Well, I've got a month's leave to make up my mind. What would you do if you stayed? I'm not quite sure. The company's pretty rough on transfers. Plus, my father would love to have me take over his business, but it's his business, and who wants to go back and live in that burg? I'm gonna have to visit him in a couple of days. What'll I do with it? I can't stop it. What made you run down to south America for so long? Oh, the usual pressures, and the work was the kind of work that I liked. With all the construction around Sao Paulo and the rest of south America is a regular engineer's paradise. Have you ever been up in the statue of Liberty? I never have either. Both times when I left the country, when I was in the army and I went to south America, as I went past it, I was feeling pretty sad. But, coming back, I got such a special kind of a feeling. I'd like to climb it that sound crazy? What? Would you like to go sightseeing? Sure. Mama, a boy threw my boat in the water. What happened to the string? Okay, come on, Peggy, I'll get it. Hey, come on! Whoa! Lucky your father was able to get it. He's not my father. Look how tiny. You think Peggy's all right? Oh, sure. Stomachache was just an act. Doesn't like being left with Carol on Sundays. Can you see the people in the crown? Of course. "With silent lips, 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!â„¢ Sorry. Look, that's just like Peggy. She hasn't been here either. Have to bring her sometime. Larry, do you mind if we don't climb to the crown? - It's so high. - What do you mean? Look how low it is. Okay, we've got lots more to do anyway. You look beautiful. - Have you had enough? - No. But I'll take some more later. Let's get a souvenir for Peggy. Oh, look. Look. Would you like one? How much? Would you mind taking a picture for us with the park in the background? Sure, where do you snap? This is the thing you snap. Can you get the park in? Oh, no. Okay, that's swell. You wanna get closer? Closer. - Okay. - Thanks a lot. - Can you take one of us? - Sure. Closer. Oh, I'm frightfully sorry. Closer. Wish you didn't have to work tomorrow. I don't, I don't work every day. Wonderful more sightseeing? Well, I'd love to, but I promised I'd look at a new house for a friend of mine. He's planning on buying it. I got a rented car to drive out in. Would you like to keep me company? Sure. You know we've been together since 9:00 this morning? But really, she's been cranky all day long. Well, I hope she didn't give you too much trouble. - No. - Goodnight, Carol, thanks. Thank you, goodnight. Oh, look, a fireplace. Ne's been and gone already. It's beautiful okay, I'll take it. Well, take it easy now, we haven't seen it yet. It's enough for me. Oh, wonderful. Oh yeah, how about that? What is that? It's just the damper. What are these? What are those? How pretty. Would you mind saying a few words into the microphone, please? Yes, this is a lovely house, and I'll take it. Want this on? Larry? Larry, closets. Know what? - What? - I'm hungry. Well, let's hop into the car and go get something to eat. Got a better idea. - What? - Let's eat here. Here? What'll we eat? You can go down and get something. Okay, what'll I get? Whatever you want. Okay. Don't forget to buy some hot dogs, and hurry back! What's all this? Hey. Boy, am I in the right place? And flowers, too! Wait till you see the ones I bought you. Oh, they're sweet. How do ya like the bunny? Did you bring this for me? That's for Peggy, this is for you. I'm starved... oh, wood. Got enough here to stay for a week. Be nice, wouldn't it? Mama, look at the camera Peter gave me. Oh, how lovely. You must be Larry. Yeah, hello, Peter. Look at Peggy. Get closer, Larry. Do it like Peter. That's very good, nice and still good girl. Peter, you've been handling her beautifully. Well, she's been wonderful to work with - goodbye, Larry. - Bye. - Gotta go now. - Okay. Goodbye, Peggy. I'll be calling you. Will you read to me? - This? - Yes, this. - It's a little technical. - It's okay. "If this failure of these pioneers to communicate with one another seems surprising, you should remember that dissemination of technical information had not reached its present state." "Does this strike you as remarkable that the techniques for making..." "High quality sound..." "High quality sound." "Records for the use of electromagnetism were not made use of until some 20 years after the individual theories had been put forward? Wouldn't you have thought the engineer working on the same problem long after the first idea..." "Had been put forward for a very thorough investigation into all the discoveries pertaining to that idea..." "The idea of laying a sound wave..." I don't like that story. Read me another one. - What other story? - That one. - Where? - Over there. There? Yeah Any particular one? - That one. - Okay. "This whale's name was Fairchild Harrington, and he lived in one of the biggest houses you could imagine." "For the house Fairchild lived in was the whole pacific ocean. It was so big that, just in case he ever wanted to, he could run up to the north pole." Do you wanna read? Yes. Okay, try it here. "Sahara desert. Now this needn't had presented too much of a problem. However, Fairchild didn't know yet was that his dis..." "Place" "displacement was going to be - too great for the..." - Peggy, bedtime. "Suez canal." "Suez canal." I wish we had television. Goodnight, Peggy. I left my doll on the couch. That's mine. It's a hot night. Could cool off in a movie. I'm not in the mood for a movie. Could always get a babysitter. I'd rather stay right here. Where'd you get that? My grandmother gave it to me. - Oh, Peggy. - I'm hungry. You just ate. I'm still hungry. Well, go in the kitchen and get yourself a cookie or something. Peggy, goodnight. Did you look like that when you were seven? I don't know. What did you look like when you were seven? I had curls. Oh, no. Yes. Oh, no. You think maybe we could lock the door or something? If we really have trouble with her. I have to brush my teeth, don't I? I just ate something. Finish brushing your teeth and get right back into bed. Now. I don't feel good! I'm hot all over. Peggy, just throw off a sheet. It's a hot night. Tomorrow, let's get a babysitter. I think I have a temperature or something. You haven't got a temperature. Now, just throw off a sheet. Go to sleep. Peggy! Are you up again? If you don't stop that, I'm gonna have to come in there and spank you. You better not or I'll tell my mother. She doesn't believe in hitting children. Carol, do you like Larry? Sure. I think he's cute. Is your mother gonna marry him? Of course not. I've been feeling wonderful ever since I first got back. Being home again, seeing the city with you. I wish I hadn't told my father I'd go back there tomorrow. Ann, I didn't say I was really going. I don't see how I can now. I'd rather stay here with you. Besides, I'd hoped to be able to take you back with me when I went. You know what? â€œWhat? Did you know that a baby kangaroo is smaller than my little finger, and it goes in its mother's pocket and doesn't come out for months? I didn't know that. Larry, are you gonna marry my mother? Ooh, this is much bigger than Janie's. Isn't mom supposed to get a ring? Sure. She'll get a wedding ring later. Hi. What's this? It's our engagement present. On! Well, you think that's the right place for it? Where else are you gonna put it? You know, it needs something. Oh, no, not that. - Not there. - Yes, I like it. - Oh, no. - But I like it. And, now, to repeat the local weather look at Peggy. Heat and humidity continuing on the eastern sea coast perfect weather for the beach. Temperature, 78. Turn it off! - We don't want to honk the horn. - I'm all ready! Okay? Ooh, I forgot something. Peggy, a doll carriage at the beach? I'll take care of it myself. Peggy! I'll get it. No, no, no, no, I'll get it. I'll meet you over by the soft drink stand. Okay. A million, trillion, billion cars. A million... A million, trillion, a million, trillion cars. Ooh, a parking space. Larry... Come on! Come get your carriage. Peggy! All right, Peggy, here's your things. I'm going to the beach. What happened? I thought you got lost. Oh, no. How can you get lost in a parking lot? - Come on. - Hey, wait a second. I need a drink of something. Why'd you get so filthy? Coke, please. Large. - What were you doing? - Nothing. Now how do you expect to drag that across the sand? I'll go slow. Mama, wait for Mel - Feel good? - Sure. Where's Peggy? You know you're not supposed to go in without telling me first. - Come on! - Oh! Wait! Wait a second! Look what I brought for Peggy. Oh, not now, Larry. Not all at once. Oh, okay. Be right back. Hey, Peggy? You know you're not supposed to have those now. I want 'em now. Well, all right. Don't eat "em all now, huh? Don't eat 'em all. The only thing wrong with New York is you have to, uh... You have no place to park a car. I'd still like to live in the country. Yeah, but you have to be a millionaire. Can you picture me being a commuter? Sure. Where's Peggy? There. Did I tell you that Brockman thinks he can get me transferred to the New York office? Wonderful well, I don't think he can swing it, but I'm willing to try. He's arranged for us to have dinner with one of the vps and his wife. Peggy give you a hard time in the parking lot? Uh-huh. Larry, I know it's hard in the beginning. Got to give her a little time. She'll get to love you as much as I do. Well, it's only for a day, and dad will meet her after we're married anyhow. Isn't it that you just don't want to take her with us to meet him now? What you're actually doing is ask... asking me to pretend she doesn't exist. He's an old guy. I just don't want to shock him. Peggy. Peggy! Stay out of the water! You've let Peggy go in the water alone. You know she's not supposed to go in the water alone. Well, she knows that too, doesn't she? She's a child. She was right here. I didn't go swimming. I just went in to wash the sand out of my hair. I think I swallowed a sucker. Where did you get a sucker? Larry gave it to me. I want to go home. That's just where we're going. Here, Larry, Larry. Very nice. Now, Peggy, let's have a little smile. Yeah, Larry, let's have a little smile. I-p-p-o-p-o-t-a-m-u-s. Peggy, come inside, I have a present for ya. No. I don't want to go inside. Don't you want to see your present? I don't want to go inside. Oh, Peggy. It's a doll. Don't you want to see it? I like my old doll. What did I do wrong? She's in a mood, Larry. Why don't you just leave it? Well, if she doesn't like this one, why don't I take her downtown and let her pick one out that she does like? It isn't the doll she doesn't like. It's just that she's attached to the old one, the one that frank gave her. Besides, you don't know what it's like taking a kid to a toy store. They don't know what they want, and you can't get them out of the place. Did you ever try using a bow tie? I hate them. I don't see why it'll be such a job to take a kid to a store. Try it. Okay, I will. It's about time she did something alone with me. How long is Peter gonna be hanging around here? Oh, Larry, you can't expect her to accept you overnight. She... she doesn't feel the way we do. Okay, okay, let's not argue, especially not today. Shall I wear my new dress tonight? Yeah. Okay. I'll get Peggy ready. This is what I want. You looked at that over an hour ago and you didn't want it. What do you want it now for? But I want it. Uh, one of these, please. Let's go get some lunch. You know what? Platypuses eat a whole lot of big, fat, juicy worms every day. How do you know? Peter told me. Come on. All right, you've had enough now. Come on, we're going. Larry? â€œWhat? I have to go to the bathroom. Why didn't you tell me when we were in the store before? All right. Go in the restaurant. Ooh, my ankle! You know you're not supposed to do that. My ankle hurts. Stomach hurts too, and he made me pick a present in a hurry. And it was a rotten sandwich and he made me eat every bit of it. Then he made me fall, so I broke my ankle - and then he hit me. - Peggy, Peggy, you know that's not true. You're a liar and I hate you. And he lost me too. I told you she didn't look well this morning. What did you do to her? What do you mean what did I do to her? It's just been impossible to handle her all day long. When is the babysitter coming? Did you have to hit her? You don't believe that, do ya? Well, what if I had? I'm sick and my ankle is growing. I can't leave her alone when she's like this. You know how much tonight means. This is gonna put John in a fine spot. She's just... she's just doing it to try to keep you from going out. Can't you go without me? How? You don't think she got sick from eating that sandwich, do ya? I hope not. I still have to call the doctor, you saw her ankle, and I can't leave her alone when she's like this. Besides, it's partly my fault. How can you be so blind? I suppose you think you're right. Well, uh, you're about as right as that thing on the TV set. What's wrong with it? Well, if you don't know, I can't tell ya. Larry, I think you wanted this argument. Are you gonna come out with me tonight or not? Mama, I can't get my program clear. I told you not to play with the inside dials. E-g-g I told you not to play with the phone. It's for two people. I was only spelling. Mommy, my matches are all upset. Oh, everything happens to me. Play with me, mama. Oh, Peggy, you're going to camp in a couple of days. Can't you find something to do for 48 hours? No Isn't Peter going to be shooting you tomorrow? Yeah, the last time. Peggy, go find your camera and take some pictures. There's no film in it stop wiggling your tooth and go away and stop annoying me. Go on. Hello. I'm fine. No, but I'm here. Oh, lots of things. My favorite fish Bobby is sick. Television set is broken. Wait a minute. My tooth is very shaky. Larry, where have you been all this time? Well, that's a silly reason. Yes, I missed you. She's at the grocer's, but I'm here. Right now? All right, bye. - Hi, Peggy. - Hi. - Is your mother home yet? - No. I've got a present for ya. Ooh, a puppy. Isn't he cute? Come on. Come on! Come on. Isn't he sweet? Thanks. Come on, Peggy, let's go find your mother. No, I want to stay here and play with the dog. You can take the dog with ya, come on. - How do you like that car? - It's nice, but the roof can't come off yeah, but it's ours. It is? Yup. Larry, can I have an ice cream cone? Peggy, let's go home now, I think we missed her. Janie, look what I got!
