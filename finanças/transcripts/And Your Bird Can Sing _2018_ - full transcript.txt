So mature. Just right. This topic ends here. The tonkatsu and prawn lunch box has kept you waiting. I'll just ask him, isn't he the manager? The manager is married. But a lot of people don't care. But it must be weird to do it with an uncle. Fried chicken noodles are ready. Why do you like the manager? Say sixth sense. What is love? Why do everyone lie? I don't understand. But I recently saw a freshman in our school. I feel like I am getting older. Many things make people anxious. Will youth really fade away? Who knows. But sometimes, there are cute aunts. Your order is here. Coming. Assorted Bento. Ok. Cheers With Rap you may have a hard time hearing what I want to say. But actually when you listen. I think you will understand. Please keep up. That would be the best. Let's enjoy together. Is it okay to start? The atmosphere is good. The only thing you can say is that your opinion determines everything. Let's enjoy together. I think it's good. Maybe I'm not young anymore. I just want to say what I think. I'm not confident and afraid to speak out. If you're kidding, make sure. Even if you evade reality. Things that should come still come. Anxiety about ideals and reality. All because you are too weak. Treat people with heart. Pay attention to your behavior. Be gentle with others. Try to believe to the end. I left my footprints and I still do these things. In the future, I will go forward and let others stare. Come on, look forward. Come on Come on Come on. I'm OMSB and I'm happy tonight. Think good. Let's go drink. It is you. Coincidentally, You have work hard. Have a drink. I'll treat. Cheers. Delicious. Another glass. I'm about to step on your foot. Look at your sweat. Nonsense. All sweat. Correct. Beware of cars. Wrong. Here. Good weight. Shizuo is not back yet. He is afraid to disturb us. This is too nice. We do not interfere with each other. We have fun without disturbing each other. Why? Because we are friends. It's good to have Shizuo in your life. I think so. Are we friends? 1,400 yen in total. I'll go out. 1,400 yen in total. I'll go out. Call me on something. Charge you 1500 yuan. Got it. I'm leaving. It is good. I'm leaving. We don't sell that here. This kind of book has been selling very well recently. Ok then I'll buy this thanks. Thank you. There is a thief there. Come Why do you ignore me? Caught him? He ran away. Why did you let him go? Calm down. I'm calm. Your lips are shaking. Are you playing me? Are you so honestly saying that? Your expression is very interesting. Are you OK? All right. Excuse me. Sorry for the disturbance. Moriguchi is bleeding. He himself did it. He just hit me and fell by himself. You really want to hit him? Don't do this. Not answering the phone. Does Shizuo know about me and the manager? It doesn't matter, how could you tell him this? Is it? Why did you ask so? It doesn't matter if he knows it. I want to tell the manager tonight. You guys continue. Very troublesome. I want to end it. But you contacted him after that. To separate. How can it be so simple? Is it so exaggerated? Aren't you just playing? What did you say? I don't like him but... Don't you look down on me and the manager? I didn't look down on you. Then talk nice to me. There is always a way. Leave it alone and break it naturally. So I don't want to do that. Got it. It will always be solved. When is your friend coming? Almost. Where to go in a while? Not decided. Is it? Don't do that again after that. Okay thank you. That line, you need to correct it. Yes. What happened? Are you his friend? Yes. What do the police do? So you are feeling depressed. Good night. Goodbye. Go back now. I'll go back. I will have another drink. Stop drinking and go back. -Goodbye Don't you really go? Not going. I can spend a few days leisurely. Doing nothing. I know. Set the bonfire when the sun goes down. Look at the stars. Get up for a cup of coffee in the morning. Look at the lake. Take a nap. You don't understand. Honestly, I'm just not interested. Here. Then I went with Sachiko Time is January 30. The venue is Vocational Skills Training Center Please come over then. Yes. This is all today. Any questions? No problem. Ok. You have work hard. You have work hard. Thank you. Welcome Are you resting or skipping work? I will not go again. I will tell you after meeting. Are you all right? Do I need to say? Are you some time? Yes. How much do you think you can earn by selling a book for 1,000 yen? I do not know. If someone stole a book, It takes ten books to break even. Really bad for business. You can fire me. Do not say that. You are so casual. Then if there is a thief next time, I will definitely catch him. That's it. Are you going back? Yes. I didn't sleep much. I am feeling a bit tired. If you go back this time, Madam will be surprised. Did I tell you? I Divorced the year before. It's okay. Since you are not late and absent from work, I thank you. About Sachiko... You need to cherish her. Did you wait for a long time? Not at all. Thank you for coming. What to do next? I said Why do you live together? Besides saving money. This. Because I feel happy. Just this? But that guy. is incredibly cheerful. Inside and outside. Didn't he have trouble understanding his thoughts? This How to say. I feel like he didn't really think much. Are you okay? Many things accumulate. I don't know how to say. I don't understand. It's all things that don't understand. Take a look. It was burnt by the smoke just now. This shirt looks so nice. Really? I like it very much. Thank you. It's all my fault, sorry. What are you talking about? What happened when you let the thief go? Later I went to the manager. You were scolded in the office just now. But I wanted to get back to you. I want to revenge. I do not mind. Then this matter is done. Saa-chan (Sachiko) has resigned, so he has to recruit new people. Saa-chan and the manager went for a drink last night. Those two definitely have something. Obviously we are working hard. Such a paddler is simply rubbish. What? so Obviously we are still working hard. Those who enjoy paddling are trash. Right, am I right? Don't you like Saa-chan too? What the fuck do you know? It hurts. Sorry I'm sorry. Your mother called. Oh Pick it up. Sachiko. Didn't hinder you two? This is so boring. While Listening to Olivia (Olivia wo Kikinagara) -Anri I like to listen to my favorite song alone. Because Olivia comforts my lonely heart. Jasmine tea is my sleeping pill. On nights like this, I want to end the day in my way. When we meet, I never thought that there would be days like that. Making good things better. No, it's over, time has just passed. Tired of you who is in love with an illusion of me. We are back. So stuffy. So noisy. What time did you come back? I do not remember. What time is it? Didn't wake you up? No. Because Shizuo is too noisy. I have been sleeping. That's good. We can just go with you. I don't like singing karaoke very much. You just lied. What? When we came back last night, Are you actually awake? Do you want to ask me if I am jealous? What? OK, I'm jealous. Don't do this. You asked me. Let me go. I'll go out. I said Did the manager mention me? He did. What did you say? To cherish you. How did you answer? I did not say anything. Why didn't you say something? What happened? Why this expression? Then I'm going out. I wish you a happy camping. Is he gone? Yes. Like this? Does he bring an umbrella? No It doesn't feel like it is raining today. The weather is hard to tell recently. Too Do you want to drink coffee? Yeah give me a drink. Come. Not coming at all. Let me do it. This way this way. Okay. Hello, my first meeting. My name is Hasegawa. I'll take care of you in the future. Sorry I forgot to wear trousers. It's ok. Come. Over here. Moriguchi doesn't answer the phone. He resigned, right? Probably not. It's hard to find a job at that age. Who cares? You did nothing, right? How is this possible? Remember to lock the door. Good work. I am back.

Came to see you at home. Was she healthy then? Is she normal? She said she was worried because she couldn't reach him. What are you going to do? There are no trains now. I'll see her tomorrow morning. Then do it. It's a hundred when dead. What? So troublesome. Got retribution. What is retribution? Like this every day. Don't think about that kind of thing. Is there anything wrong with drinking and playing? Don't say they are the same thing. That's it. You still don't understand. OK, next is Sachiko. Are you going back? Who said I am coming? You.
