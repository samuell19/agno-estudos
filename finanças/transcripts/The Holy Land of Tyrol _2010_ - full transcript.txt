MOUNTAIN BLOOD (The Holy Land of Tyrol) It's been years since it all happened, I was still a girl then. The century was young and full of turmoil. The French Revolution was 15 years ago, and it's winds of change blew all over Europe. It's gusts even reached us here, in the mountains of Bavaria. I'm coming! Good morning, Miss. Good morning. (in thick Tyrol dialect) I've brought the table that the doctor ordered. Place it over here. I'll call the doctor. There was something new in the air. I felt that something was coming. Then I saw him for the first time. A stranger from the mountains, who came down to Augsburg to become an apprentice. I knew immediately that he was the one. In the beginning we were meeting... ...in secret. But when my Tyrollean apprentice became a master craftsman, my father eventually consented to the marriage. But everything changed on that fateful day in February 1809. It started with good news, But by the evening, our life in ruins. I have a nice piece of meat for you. This is good for you French. You will need it, if you go to Russia with your Napoleon. Hey you! Give that meat back! Bastard! If I catch you! But do you at least know what it means? -No. Gallus, means rooster. Okay for a farm, but not here. Well, it sounds good. But it's the meaning that matters -Oh, Kathe ... No, Franz. - And a family name? No. Then call it Sepp, like my grandfather. If it's a girl, then Burgl like my grandmother. -I'm serious Franz. Why talk about it when it's so far away -Then I think we're in trouble. Are you sure? I'm already two months late, and every morning I'm unwell. Yes, I am sure. Dear Lady, dear Sir... Come here, I have something nice for you. Let's see. -No, don't be stupid. Do you want to get Typhus? -Come, Katharina. Let me buy you something. You see, I was right. I know a good person when I see one. Dear woman, can I interest you in one of these masterpieces of Bavarian craftsmanship. Look at the detail. You have saints? -Yes. Or something for an expectant mother? -Oh. A wonderful thing! With parents so beautiful, your baby will be a beauty. Can I suggest St. Joseph of Nazareth? It is perfect for any family. Or maybe you would prefer St. Eustach from Rome? Or St. Philip Neri? It is a classic, a very popular choice! But I see that the lady has already chosen. I almost forgot him, St. UIrico, not only is he the patron saint of Augsburg, but he protects expectant mothers as well. -Very nice. You'll take this then? -Yes. Then take it. Trust your instinct. You are generous, Sir. I would have given to you for less. -Keep the rest. St. UIrico lived almost 1000 years ago. But his work... -I'll take this one as well. -Just a moment, Sir. He took care of the sick and the poor. -I'm in a hurry! Please serve me right away. Sorry, Sir, first come first served... Wheather French or Bavarian. -We are all allies. We should consider ourselves lucky to serve Napoleon. -Oh, of course "Liberte, fraternite... ...whatever". This need not happen! -Mr. Sergeant. -I just want to.. buy this figurine. Franz, let's go. Why won't you serve me? Is it the uniform? Heathen Frenchman! What did you say? -It doesn't concern you. What did you say, Bavarian idiot? -We're going Franz. Who is your Kaiser? Eh, who is? -Calm down please. My Kaiser is in Vienna. I'm from Tyrol.. and my flag is red-white-red. You filthy dog! You wouldn't dare... Sergeant! -I'm going. (in French) I have always had respect for the French army. You are the liberators of Europe. Please, Sergeant. I am the daughter of Dr. Heimstedt, the pox doctor for the Royal Baverian... Please stop! -Soldier, you strike a pregnant women, and we are peacefull citizens. Franz! I hardly even touched her.. We have to go. Who did this? Wait outside. You can not help. She is pregnant. No. Mamma. - Amelia. Bring me my bag and clean bandages... go! Yes Sir. Wait outside and leave us alone. Come, Franz. She is fine. But she lost the baby. (in French) Open up! They still go from house to house, questioning people. Ludwig! For them, the life of a Frenchman is worth more than that of a Bavarian. How many of our soldiers do you think die, every day on the front lines for Napoleon? Sit down. I beg you. It is he who must go. Not you. He killed a Sergeant. They are looking for him. -Papa! Just the thought of a Bavarian girl in Tyrol is ridiculous. Tyrol is poor. It's a region in crisis and it is dangerous. Papa, please! You're a bad husband... and a bad son in law. Look at me when I talk to you! Where would you be today if it wasn't for me? You irresponsible Tyrollean! If we had not taken you into this house, then... You would be... Probably your father is right my child. It is too cold to travel this season. Franz doesn't have these problems. He is accustomed to it. Stay here for a few months... then follow him. In the meantime, you can recover, and become strong. Now you're too weak and frail. I'll keep you healthy, and your mother will spoil you. I've already decided, father. Ludwig... Let it go. The two belong together. I'll get you papers... And you will leave for Tyrol tomorrow with the courier carrying vaccines. But be careful: If you go now, you need not come back. You'll wish you never left this house. With him at my side, I passed the mountains that separated us from his homeland. I haven't looked back even once. Whatever awaited me in this new country, I knew I was right. For the horse, as agreed. -Yes, as agreed. Look! Our farm. I was born and raised there. Those are your brothers? -No. A farmhand and a maid. Hey! Christoph? What's going on? (in Tyrol dialect) If we have to die of hunger, we can do it the village. What did he say? Come. Stay out! You dirty lot. No... Franz. What are you doing here? I come to visit you. -But of course! It's been so long! Look mother, This is Katharina, my wife. -Her there? Hello, mother-in-law. Do you understand Tyrollean? No, use the words of the Holy Bible with her. I am Elisabeth. I brought you something, Elisabeth. No no, I can't accept it. Please. It's a real silk scarf, mother. If I may... In the name of the father, the son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. The first time I ate with his family, I immediatly realised how different I was from them. His father, Gallus... his older brother, Hermann; his younger brother, Veit; and his mother, Elisabeth. In Augsburg he must have felt such a stranger. Is something wrong? -No, really. (dialect) How did he convince you to come? I'm sorry? Are you, or are you not his wife? I did not understand. -Use the words of the Holy Bible. The question for the young lady was... Hermann. -I asked if you're his wife. Do you know how? Husband and wife... like a Buck and his Doe. This here is goat. -Quiet. Eat and be glad to be together. Yes, I am his wife if that was the question. Well, the real question was: What did he promise you to make you leave your rich city? A Doe does not abandon her Buck... and Tyrol is a beautiful place. (dialect) so says the one who doesn't like our food! Quiet now! For Christ's sake! Here it is all too different. It's a new beginning. My mother... She always put these in my bed. She put none in mine. I can warm it up for you. Thankyou, Katherle. For what? For everything. So.. What is so beautiful in Bavaria? Five years you were there! In Bavaria everything is different. -For instance? Even dogs get an education. -Yeah? Sure. They even send the dogs to University! I always knew that we were ruled by dogs. Good morning. Elisabeth Have you seen Franz? -It's been morning for four hours, morning is for working. Now it is late morning and there is work to be done. Franz is out with Veit. He will be back for lunch, and will expect it on the table. Can I at least... You can cut the potatoes, so they will cook faster. After that you can go get some milk and a loaf of bread. Put an apron on. We wouldn't want to soil your beautiful dress. Got it! I never thought we'd see you again. It's nice to have you back here. I missed you. Damn, missed. Is he with us or not? I have not yet spoken. What's wrong? The innkeeper is back from Vienna. You mean Andreas Hofer? We have support from the Kaiser there. -What do you mean? I told you that you he was too long in Bavaria. Franz is my brother. Taught me to shoot and has always been there for me. He doesn't even speak Tyrollean anymore. -Shut up, Georg! Martin, come here. The Bavarians have been bullying us for four years with taxes and decrees! They suppress the church, they closed the monasteries, and send our brothers to war. There have always been hard times. These will pass. Hey, Franz. Hello, Martin. A fully grown Buck! -Yeah. 30 lashes, 30 lashes with a stick of wood. Just because he didn't pay a bribe to a Bavarian Lieutenant. Asshole. These are our forests. These are our mountains. And now we fight back. Virgin Mary, rejoice. Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed be Thou among women, Blessed is the fruit of Your womb, you have given birth to the Saviour... Here, take what you need and leave me alone. Keep your money... Bavarian I don't want your gifts. In Tyrol, we work for our money Take it and prepare a good lunch, There are at least 100 guilders here. If you want to stay here, then work. If you want to survive, then eat what we eat. And if you want to do good, then give your money to someone who is poorer than we are. Are you okay? It's nothing. Give them time, Kathele. Here there is nothing but high mountains and steep meadows. But our people made them fertile, a little at a time. They have grown together with their land. And they don't want the French or Bavarians to take it away. Tyrol is their Holy land. Maybe I can just eat the cherry jam for breakfast. March 1809 Good morning. Bavarian whore. Come, let's go. It's nice here, true, Katharina? -Yes. Good morning. You are from Augsburg? Yes of course. -Then we are countrymen. Katharina Egger. -"Eggr" we say. I am the parish priest of the village. And what is your family name? -Heimstedt. Heimstedt, yes? Well, I would like to thank you for the generous donation to the collection plate. It will benefit the poor. The Tyrolleans are nice people. I have always liked them. But they speak their mind freely. Stay strong, young Frau Egger. Acceptance is only a question of time. -Bavarian hypocrite! -Time we have plenty of. -You idiot. Who is the man with the beard? The innkeeper Andreas Hofer. Our leader. -I'll be right back. -Yep. -Let's go. What is Veit up to? -He's having a discussion. Andreas Hofer met the Kaiser in Vienna. -He said that it is time for the Bavarians to leave us Tyrollean alone. What does it mean? Let's not talk about politics now. -She has ears, the lady knows all about politics, and about how to invest her money. -Mother. He is wanted in Augsburg. Such a klutz! What you doing again? I'm decanting the vinegar. -But not into the wine carafe! I'll rinse it right away. -Chop, chop! Good morning. We are looking for Franz Egger. What you want from Franz? -I have an arrest warrant in his name. Where is he? -Franz is not here. Search the stable and the barn! Yes, Lieutenant! (dialect) Shame On You! We speak the same language. -Franz Egger! Shame on you, Napoleon's puppet. Stay here. -We have an arrest warrant. Come out! We have almost nothing. And now you want to drink our last drop of wine. Beasts like you need only hay. -Come out! -Franz! -Lieutenant! -Lieutenant! That is not Franz Egger. Or are you? It is his brother. -Hey, I asked you a question! Are you Franz Egger? -And if I were? No, it isn't him. Franz is not here. Go inside, mother! On your knees. Bavarian bastards! Let him alone! Go inside Mother! Stop! I am Bavarian like you. We already know about you. You should be happy that we can't take you with us. Bring me Franz Egger! He is not here! Franz! Franz! In five seconds, your brother will be dead! Look! The Tyrollean has pissed his pants. Disgusting! Put down your weapons. Quickly!. -You are forbidden to bear arms. I couldn't care less what you Bavarians think! If Franz Egger is not here, then we are going to take this one to "court"... that is if Franz Egger will not take his place! I guarantee you this: (dialect) Either you leave now, or you will be leaving in body bags! We will report this, be sure of that. No. We will report you! Dogs! Stop! -Up There! Father! My god, man! He was resisting our orders!. -Bring a bandage! Animals! It was an accident. -Animals! Animals! -The bandages! Your animals! In my mind, now we are even. Your scum, scum!! Veit! Help me carry him. Veit, help me I said! Now and at the hour of our death. Hail Mary, full of grace. Blessed You among women... What happened? Now we know why you have come back. -Where were you? In the village. What happened? The Bavarians were looking for you. Let us pray that he survives. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you... Thou blessed among women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb. O Jesus, forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you... Franz! Come! Come on! Mother! What's going on? The Austrians... they declared war on the French and the Bavarians. Blessed be Jesus Christ! What does it mean? -The innkeeper... Hofer has called for an uprising. "Men, it is time!" he screamed. The rifle company march in formation. Every man or boy... has been called up to join us. We will drive them out of our Tyrol once and for all! Rosemarie! You won't believe it: Hofer has called for war. The rebellion begins. The Austrians have declared war on the French and Bavarians. Come On! Mary, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Marys, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. What is it? What is going on? What are you doing here? What do you want? What is the meaning of this? Out with it! -One word... and I shoot! -You understand? Franz, we must go! Where is my rifle? Where is my rifle? Franz! But Hermann remains at home? -The oldest son must remain on the farm. Where is my rifle? Your leader an innkeeper, you peasants! -My rifle! You have changed. You're so angry. Let's not argue, Kathele. I have to do this now. -Give me one reason. Give me a reason and you can go. -Franz! I will return. I promise you. And then i'll stay. I am proud of you. Take care of yourself and return home. Pray for us, mother. I hope you come back soon. There is much work to be done. Franz, I am proud of you. How can you let them go, Elisabeth? How can you send them to die? You will never understand. Take care of my father. And my mother, and help Hermann the best you can. Franz! I love you. Bring him home safe and sound. Franz, we have to go. -I'll come back as soon as I can. May the Lord be with you, my boys. Have you ever cooked, or mopped a floor in your life? Well? We had servants. -Servants? So you had servants? -Yes. And guests we dealt with in a different way. Well excuse me if we haven't slaughtered a (dialect) hog for you... all that we have is gruel and potatoes. A hog? My god! A hog... A pig! So stupid! One, two, three Is it so hard? Look here. One, two, three. One, two, three. You have to be faster. One, two, three. Are useful as a silk scarf in the mountains. I'm sorry, my child. I did not see you. Perhaps you could learn to empty them yourself. What herbs are we looking for? I'm looking for Valerian, Shepherd's purse, Coltsfoot, St. Barbara, Gentian and Pulmonaria. You know them all so well? -For a peasant farm doctor. I'm not educated exactly as your father probably is... but I can read. And I know what I need. Henbane, you know it? -No. It is also called deadly nightshade. We are lucky. It is hard to find. It is similar to belladonna. It's poisonous right? -No, the dose makes the poison. Five seeds relieves the pain. I mix it with tobacco and give it to patients with toothache. 15 seeds would put an adult to sleep... take a double dose, and you won't wake up ever again. Stop! Spit it out! Come on, Frau Doctor! Ten years ago, I was with them. Gallus! I was in the first Napoleonic War. Now my eyesight is too bad. Don't worry about them, Katharina. They will be fine. They are sharpshooters, not just hunters. You are right. Did you know that Elisabeth was born in a city? In Meran. No. -She came to St. Martin... as a young girl. They all shunned her. The spoke behind her back. It all changed once she knocked a tooth out from one of her tormentors. Yes Sir. That is Elisabeth. My Elisabeth. What are you doing here? -I want to learn how to milk. You? Milking a cow? So. Always like this. See? All right. Your turn. Watch me. Watch how I move my hands. One, two, three... One, two, three... It almost seems like you're playing the piano. Hello Elisabeth. Good morning. Where did you get the milk? -In the stable. Did you let the hens out then? -It's already done. The egg shells are already scattered too. And I fed the hogs. So... then can you set the table? All right. Are we in, Father? Only if you have a good hand. What now? Huh? Too rich for me. Let's play again. I'll get it. Stay here. -Good evening, Father. What's going on? Good evening. -Good evening. Want something to drink? No thanks, I'm in a hurry. -Any news? Yes, all right. Apparently, the Tyrolleans... they defeated the French and Bavarians. It's over. I am as surprised as everyone else, from Kaiser Franz of Austria to Napoleon. It seems that... The Bavarians are leaving Tyrol. It seems that... ...the Lord is on our side. Can I offer you a drink, Father? -Thanks, but God has rewarded me. Another thing... Pray for the victims on both sides. Of course, I will do so. -I'll let myself out. Imagine reciting a rosary for the enemy! No offence... Today is a good day. Today is a good day for Tyrol. Be happy, Katharina. Franz and Veit will return soon. Now drink, and we celebrate the good news. Our one, two, three. -Let's drink! Where is Franz? Katharina... Take it please. Why do you have his rifle? Because otherwise that sack of bones would of been even slower! My Kathele. See? I brought him back to you. -My boys! -What did we miss? It was great! Whole Bavarian battalions fled! We took many prisoners. Has the torn his achilles tendon. -What? We were at war, a few scratches is nothing. But this is no scratch. Hi, Franz. -Hi, Hermann. How are you? It's nice to have you home. There is much to be done. I'll prepare something to eat, meanwhile tell me how it all went. -There is a lot to tell. Then we hear at all. There was a time when Franz... One time, Franz infiltrated the 8th company to take ammunition for our troops. If he had not done it, we would have been overwhelmed. I know how difficult the last months have been, and how much we have risked. The Kaiser Franz personally, The Kaiser of Austria, personally gave us this message: Men, we did it. We're free again! The whole world looks to Tyrol, even Napoleon took note! That ugly dwarf! And when the Bavarian and French generals ask me, how an innkeeper drove an uprising, I would say simply: my father was an innkeeper. My grandfather was an innkeeper. And it is the divine right of the Tyrollean innkeepers to throw out of the door un-welcome guests! Wine and pork, wine and pork for everyone! And music! Health and happiness! -Cheers! Tyrol! Father, ask the waitress to bring us another schnapps. You want one too? Don't leave Franz alone too long! I don't believe it. -I had to read to her for three hours. And then she said, in a quiet voice, almost as if it were a secret: "Are you sure that is written in the Tyrollean Bible?" And I said: "Elisabeth, Paul's hymn to love is over 2000 years..." Franz! Hermann! Franz! They have crossed us! They have sold us out! -What's going on? The Kaiser Franz of Austria met with Napoleon. He made peace with the French, and has surrendered Tyrol to them. This cannot be true. But he promised... -It's official. I read the decree myself in the village. This is not true. Back to work... Veit! Ah the young Frau Egger... Please, come in. -Thank you, Father. What brings you here at this hour, Frau Egger? The news from Vienna worries me greatly. I need your advice, father. For weeks I prayed in an empty church. Tyrol against the rest of the world. Andreas Hofer is rallying the people: A final push... they will fight again. They say terrible things about French, there is talk of much stronger forces. I fear a it will end in a bloodbath. In Tyrol there is a curse, my dear Frau Egger. Our alps are the gateway between North and South. He who holds Tyrol, holds the key. What do you mean? Don't be so naive! Father, what is the worst that can happen? Tyrol will fall! It's simple arithmetic. Napoleon grasps Europe with both hands. His army is gathering near Innsbruck. It is twice the size of any army the Tyrolleans can possibly muster. And he will show no mercy. What can I do? Pray. Pray that Napoleon will have mercy, and that none of those whom you love will take part in this final battle. Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen... Fourteen... Fifteen... Damn! Don't go, Franz. Nothing will happen to me. Hofer knows what he is doing. Dear Kaiser Franz... tomorrow you can start cleaning your rifle and sharpening your blades. Today, I need you to help me. Yeah, i'm coming. Maybe you should go dazzle the French with your shiny rifle! Better polish it up properly then! -A job must be done properly. I'll be there in a minute. -Don't worry, I dont need you... dammit! In three days we will be back at Bergisel... ...just in time for All Saint's day. You whispered something in my ear the last time you left... Kathele... You made a promise. You said that you'd be back and then you would stay. Take this, your almost out of tobacco. Thanks, Kathele. I don't feel well. Lie down. Yes, Commander. Franz? Come in. I heard stumbling on the stairs? Franz drank a little too much. He's sleeping. Never mind. See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. Good morning. Good morning. -Morning. -Mother, have you seen my socks? -We have to go! They're still drying on the balcony. Is Franz still asleep? Katharina? -I can't find them! Have you two been fighting again? Katharina, it will get better. I too wish that they would stay at home. The witch! That nasty witch! She crippled him! What? She crippled him, that witch! Gallus! Gallus, please! You are no longer welcome on this farm. Get out of here... ...and never come back. Evil child. Katharina, we Bavarians are always there for one another. I'm here if you need anything. We'll get you all! The Lord God is on our side! French pigs! Come in. Hi. Look, I brought you your things. Kathele... -Do not say that to me. Going back is not an option. I spoke with the priest. The parish has put in place an infirmary for the wounded. You'll help me there tomorrow. But Hermann, I... -No more "Hermann", you help now! Your father is a doctor, and I know that you can help us. I cannot think clearly. I want to be alone. -Forget It. You have lost all your wealth and everything else. Do you know what people here do to people like you? If you were free you would be murdered, and this would have happened already if Franz had not pleaded against it. Keep your mouth shut about what you did. Every surgeon is now a field medic, and a farm doctor and a doctor's daughter are better than nothing. I'll see you at the infirmary at 5:30 tomorrow morning. And Franz... ...he refuses to see you. Respect his wishes please. Franz told me many good things about you. Is he well? I heard that his war injury has worsened. Yes... but now he is better. Are these all the rooms? -Yes. It's everything the parish could give us. We have no idea how the fighting will go over the next days. Is someone there? Rosemarie? -Yes, we are back here. Hi. -Hi, Hermann. Take a look at this foot. He came in last night. He was screaming all night in pain. My feet and my toes. Do something please! I need fresh air. What is it Hermann? Gangrene? Is it looks bad. -What does that mean? I'm not sure. Maybe I will have to amputate. Forget it! Never in my life! You're joking! No, you can't. You must do something else. I do not know. Maybe it will heal on its own. -Hermann. The Bavarian should close her mouth. What is she even doing here? Hermann, I'm not a doctor. But look at that foot. It is black! He will not survive the night. Christian, go get the carpenter. Yes.. the carpenter. -He will lend us his saw. His... what? Where is she? -You can't come in! Stay there! Eva... Eva... I am sorry. We couldn't save his leg. Eva, stop. Stop it now! Witch! -It had to happen. The witch must go! Katharina! Hail Mary full of grace. The Lord be with you. Blessed is the fruit of Thy Womb, Jesus. Hail Mary full of grace... Veit! Elisabeth. Where is Veit? I have bad news. No. I knew it! The battle only lasted two hours. There were more... ...than twice as many... ...and they had four times the weapons. And what of Veit? We had to flee. All of us. Speckbacher, Haspinger... ...and Hofer. Veit was a few meters from me, and all of a sudden... a cannonball struck. I will spare you the details. But what of Hofer... It was All Saints day. He... Hofer is not... Hofer has resigned as Commander. He has surrendered unconditionally. Katharina, take my place. -What are you doing here? What does it look like i'm doing? I heard about Veit. My sincere condolences. Why are you not with your family? -Just look around you! Tyrol is destroyed. Everywhere there are people dying. -Hermann... Are you crazy? -The Bavarian should not touch me. Shut your mouth, she is my sister-in-law. You Bavarians did this to me! Calm down Hermann... -Accept our help, or you can go! I heard Andreas Hofer plans the next revolt just for you: They need men with thick heads, but with little contents. What did she say? -You have a sheep's head... ...in other words. It's your fault! Hey, Frau Doctor! Hello. He was my younger brother. No... Come back to me, Katharina. Franz, you're drunk. You're so cold. It's like as if I had married a stone. What do you think, how do you think I feel? Look at yourself! Please stop drinking. People, they need me here Franz. I need to eat. I have a hole in my stomach. There is nothing. We have nothing more to eat. What a mess! We defend our land, and you let us starve. The French confiscated all the food from the village. We must must ask for food at farms. -I'll go. I would like to go. -You, and where would you go? Rosemarie is needed here. You are also indispensable. The floor and bandages can wait. With all due respect... ...do you think anyone would give something to you? Let me deal with them myself. Hi. I was wondering if... Oh, Yes, very nice. Thank you. Is someone else here? Well? Giant potatoes, honey, lard, cheese and ham. Can I have a piece of bread? Go to hell! And you can apply your ointment where the sun doesn't shine. I come from the infirmary. We have nothing to eat. And I already asked everyone else. If you give me nothing, I dare not go back. Here, take it. Oh, thank you! Perhaps the next generation of Tyrolleans will have no arms or feet, but they will not go hungry. Thank you. It's been so long since I've eaten. Benedikt, you want a bowl? Never. Who knows what's inside it. It's a potato soup. Very tasty. -Thanks, Katharina. Well done, dear. You did well. If Hofer saw us taking soup from a Bavarian... -To hell with your Hofer. -Pig headed fool! Get lost! Calm Down. Don't let the Bavarian touch me again. I'm leaving. -You can barely walk! Don't tell me what to do! Rosemarie, get him a bowl of soup. Why do you hate me so much? I fought in Schwaz. Do you know what happened there? The Bavarians and the French gutted the... ...pregnant women and sliced off their breasts. They cut the tongues out of every one who spoke Tyrollean. They stabbed children with their bayonets and carried them around. To my cousin Karl... ...they cut off his hands and flayed his skin up to the elbows. He has a wife and children on the farm. Benedikt... ...come, eat something. It is Andreas Hofer who is the cause of this country's pain. I hope that they catch him soon. We must defend ourselves! We can no longer afford to put up with this treatment! We will kick out those French bastards, and the Bavarians with them! Our young men are being sent to their slaughter in Russia! You have taken those who are dearest to us. You might as well take the rest! Let me through! It's not possible! Gruber, he resisted them. This is exactly how the godless bastards should suffer. French pigs! My god... Have you lost your mind? -Take the pig away. Take the pig... The rightful flag! Out of the way! Out of the way! We can no longer tolerate this! Take down that flag! You kidnapped his grandson yesterday. He was a rebel! (French) Pierre, grab a torch. (French) Sebastien, go on. Tyrolleans, it's over. Your leader fled like a coward. I'll give 1,500 guilders to he who tells us where Hofer is hiding. Pigs! Pigs! Every act of rebellion will be punished. -Let me through. (French) Let her through. Pigs! (French) Let's go, and take the pig. (French) Which one? Napoleone. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. My son has smallpox. I heard you can help him? -Does he have pustules? Yes, since yesterday. Today it is worse. -Then I must see him straight away. You can't. I don't know what you are thinking, but I must see him now. You can't. And why not? He is not there. Then I'm sorry but I can't help you. I know you. You are the wife of Andreas Hofer. Let me take him the medicine. Please. -Why not ask your own doctor? Because you think God is punishing your husband with the pox? No, our doctor is being watched. My son is everything to me. When smallpox breaks out, there is no cure. We can only treat the symptoms: a warm towel for fever, tea for the throat, ointment for the pustules. God will reward you. You are a good person. God bless those who have brought disaster upon this country. -Do not underestimate, my child, the burden that my husband carries. It is so large... ...it crushes him. My husband is broken and betrayed. He was a pawn in a battle that had no chance to succeed. Don't tell me about burden. My husband is in hiding, while half of France search for him. They want to kill him, because that will break our will, He has done everything for our country, and this he has done without putting a single Guilder in his own pocket. His wife and his children, we are in debt and hungry, and must hide. His friends and advisers have abandoned him. I am sorry for what has happened to your husband. Our marriage is destroyed... Marriages don't destroy themselves. It is people who destroy them. He drinks too much. Mine too. But it is so. It is us women who are holding this country together. January 1810 (French) You little Tyrollean girls are cute. Captain, an urgent message. It comes from General Huard. And what does it say? The message is confidential. Only civilized people speak French. She will not understand. Careful! -Sorry. -A Tyrollean has told us his hiding place. We know where Hofer is hiding. Hofer... the Tyrollean leader! Put together a detachment. Jesus! Shit! Things have never been so hard. I had never been so close to freedom. I ran and ran... ...blood rushed through my veins. What should we do now? Do you always think only of yourself? We must warn him and get him to a safe place, in Switzerland or Salzburg... ...and it must be today. Then borrow Ferdl's cart, and wait with the delivery of wine in St. Martin. Hofer must come alone, otherwise they will discover us immediately. How far do you plan to go with him? Everyone in Tyrol knows him. And if we shaved off his beard? Elisabeth: this is insane! Then we take him in a wine barrel, into Switzerland. We must act quickly. We will only do it if we are all in agreement. Well? And who will warn Hofer? I will. I know his wife, she trusts me. Never, women must stay at home. You don't know the way. I'm going. -But you can't see anything in the dark, ...you're blind as a bat! I'll go. I know the way. -Franz. I'll go. -You cannot go alone in your condition. We go together. Absolutely not. Let them go. They must do it together. Virgin, rejoice. Hail Mary, full of grace. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb... Open the door, please! Open the door! Frau Hofer? It's me, Katharina Egger. I'm with my husband. You're alone? -Yes. Come in. It's cold outside You are Franz Egger, right? -Yes, it's me. Why have you come? They know you are here. You have been betrayed. We know. -So why are you still here? You have to go before they arrive. We can't do this anymore. We stay here. What? Have you lost your mind? Why? Because we stay here. -Because I say so. Commander... -I am only an innkeeper. Herr Hofer... You are in great danger. They may come at any time... and you will all be taken as prisoners. -Then that is the will of God. But you have to at least... -Leave us in peace. Are you Hans? -Yes. Your pustules have healed well. Yes, they have. Why not at least save your child? -He will be fine. My husband is in danger. And he has made his decision. -We... You may not understand, Frau Doctor, but our fate is in the hands of God now. We have a cart for you in St. Martin. My brother-in-law has prepared everything. We want to take him to Switzerland. He may wait there, and there he will recieve protection. I am a mother. But first of all, I am a wife. And it is not for me to decide. And I am a husband. But most of all, I am a sinner. And the decision is no longer mine to make. Is there anything I can do for you? You are good people... you too, Bavarian Doctor. We are very grateful to you for helping our son, Hans. But this is no longer in our hands. If you want to help us, pray for us. Now go. Thank you for what you have done. Good bye. We will pray for you. Ave Maria. Blessed thou among women. St. Maria. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb... Come. O Jesus, forgive us our sins... Save us from the fires of hell... (French) Alexandre, open the door and bring that bearded rebel out. Right away! Andreas Hofer, open the door! Immediately! Stop! Take me, but leave my family. No, we'll take them all. Mother! Let go of me! At 5:30pm, I saw him in St. Martin. They will probably take him to Bozen. And then what? And then execute him. That will not happen. Maybe they will pardon him, when the Kaiser in Vienna intervenes. Our father who art in heaven... In the name of the father, of the son and of the Holy Spirit... Amen Frenchmen! You are bad shots. "I want my countrymen and friends ...to remember me in their prayers. and that my wife not grieve. I will put in a good word for them with God. Farewell, cruel world. Dying comes easily to me, and I shed no tears. Yours in life, love your Andreas Hofer. from the Passeier Valley. " So little... ...and yet so much. It brought me good luck. In the years that followed, our farm saw more births than deaths. And Franz... ...was a good husband, and a good father. I will miss him. Grandma! Go inside. Mother, we were worried about you. There was no reason to. I just wanted to be alone for a while. You don't want to come in and say the rosary with us? I think i'll stay here a little longer. Your father would of understood. It's so beautiful here. English subs by Eopsaltria [KG]
