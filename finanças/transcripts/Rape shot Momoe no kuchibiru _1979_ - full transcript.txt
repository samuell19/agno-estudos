A NIKKATSU CORPORATION PRODUCTION His sex appeal... is first-class. Who is he? Ju Li. Will it still be first class if he has a child? Well, that would do away with it, of course. You dumb girl. Hey! That tickles! I want it! I want it! Hey... You want it too, don't you? Want what? A scandal. Those eyes... Those lips... They are first-class. Who do you mean? You mean Momoe, right? That... ...is the fruit of the forbidden tree. RAPE SHOT: MOMOE'S LIPS My phone rings. PRODUCER: HOSOGOE SHOUGO WRITER: HARIMA KOUJI ORIGINAL WORK: HIBIKI KYOUSUKE Who could be calling me tonight?

As it falls silent, I'm in my room again with a cigarette. Everyone will call you an unfaithful woman. But your supple hips are still enchanting in the night. On the other side of the bed Knocking on the wall of night In the fickle, distant rain I hear the wail of a miserable cat. Will you lay your coquettish trap for anyone? Are you just playing games with my love? I'm sorry. You'd better go somewhere else with the man you're with. DIRECTED BY FUJII KATSUHIKO - Great work, everyone! - Same to you! - Yoko! - Hey! Congratulations on winning the Best New Musical Artist award. I'm sorry, but we're due at Nonaka Plaza at 3:00. Please, let's do this while we walk. Not a problem at all, sir. This was your first time here. What are your impressions? It was hard! But you performed quite well, didn't you? Well, the other artists here are veterans. I learned a lot from them. - Yoko, wait up! - Thanks! Well, everyone, we'll leave plenty of time for questions next week. Yes, really. Yes, you'll be fine. See you then. Mr. Hoshino! I heard a rumor that in order to keep Miki Yoko around in your offices... ...you're giving her a lot of drugs. Is that true? That's funny. You going to write about that? It's a rumor. That's all. Well, just a rumor. Nothing I can do. If I write about it, they'll press charges. Thanks! - See you. Thanks. - Damn! You're digging yourself a really deep hole here. And you're way too pushy. You're going to get hurt. You can't expect to stay in business as a top-notch tabloid by behaving well. What're you doing? Help me look for the key. - The key? - Yeah. My key. It's fine. Leave him alone. What happened to your key? MILLION PUBLISHING COMPANY Morning! Oh! Toru, what're you doing here today? I'm here for my payment. Ah, of course. Here. Hello? Million Publishing... This is it? We're looking for articles that we can actually publish. See ya. What a jerk. They'll bring out some tea in a minute. OK. I'm sick of scrounging for money in this dump. I want to hit it big and wash my hands of this stuff. Why don't you go after Momoe? I told you. She's the forbidden fruit. You touch her and you'll get burned bad. If we want to go after someone, it should be Hoshino Productions' Miki Yoko. What could you find out about her? Uppers. Stimulants? That's stupid. I bet Hoshino leaked that themselves. It's a false story so no major company will try to snatch her away. After all, the police aren't getting involved with her, are they? They're just doing her some favors. Pulling some strings. Hoshino's just getting things ready for crunch time. That's all it is. All right, so what if you follow up on that story? It'll be a huge scandal. It's just too scary. I don't want to kick the bucket just yet. I'm extremely fond of melons. I can eat any kind of fruit. Hoshino, don't feed our singer too much. You don't want to make her fat. Of course. I'm sorry. Stop it! Stop! No! Stop it! Don't assault me! I can't hold it! It's okay. Just let it out. If there's traces of stimulants in your urine... I'll introduce myself to Mr. Hoshino once again. Mr. Tadokoro... Ah... thanks so much for your help. The campaign to make sure "The Angel Didn't Fly Away" was a huge success. What's that? Well, I'd love to have you over here for a banquet. Hello, Hoshino Productions. Miki Yoko's schedule in June? Hold on a moment, please. Yoko's schedule is full up to the minute! We're dealing with her engagement to appear on KBS's TV drama. No, she'll be on location after the 20th. A half-day just won't work. The tender light spills out Along with the transparent wind. In your arms... I'm still sleeping. The dewdrops in the garden Run down the glass window. Embrace me in your heart Don't let this angel fly away. TOKYO CHANNEL 12 OK, got it. I'll do it now. - Chikako, get ready in time for 5:00, OK? - OK. The child has lost her way in the wind And now she frolics all around here. Suddenly the tears spill onto her cheeks. Has she forgotten? Yoko! Can I get your autograph? I'm a big fan! Here. What's your name? Dragonfly. One more, please! I'm so happy. You bastard! Dragonfly, get her! There we go! Hurry up and drive! Quiet down! I'm sick of just jerking off while looking at your photos. Give me a kiss! The real thing's a lot better! Let me go! Looks like you'll be accompanying us. Dragonfly, keep one arm around her. Got it! Oh, in your heart there's a devil living inside. Ooh, if you know then you can't play innocent. The stars are falling and every one of them is beautiful. Soar until the end of the earth! Ooh... Throw down your arms... and your dress. Do you want to create a scandal together? Oh, tonight we make a toast to that mysterious devil. Shit! No! Stop it! I'll do whatever you say. Just don't hurt me! You think we'd mess up such a pretty face? Dragonfly, do her. Me? No, I'll do her later. Huh? Really? Well, then, I'll do it! You bastard! I'm going first! Let's do it. What's wrong? You don't want to suck me off? Don't use your teeth. No! Lick it! Come on, lick it! Goro, don't get flustered. Just look at this girl's pretty face. Yokohama... license plate number S-1112. I'm very sorry. Yoko suddenly fell ill at her home last night. She's in the hospital. Yes. What? The doctor says it's a sudden ulcer from working too hard. Anyway, I'll definitely compensate you for this. All right. I'm very sorry. Boss... I'm sorry. You idiot! I'm so sorry. - Good morning! - What do you want? - I want to see the boss. - He isn't here. - Again? - Yes, really! - He's here, isn't he? - No, he isn't! I'm serious! You'll be in trouble! See? He's here! Something bad happened to Yoko, didn't it? What happened to your head? Mr. Hoshino, is this your handiwork? Tadokoro! We'll be fine. Leave the room. Wow... This is great! Those eyes... Did you have a hand in this? Of course not. I don't have that kind of nerve. You know where Yoko is, don't you? No. But I have a hunch. These guys were lying in wait for Yoko at her mansion. So? Give me 5 million yen and I'll bring her here by tomorrow morning. Are you serious? I have a good nose for these things. Here. What's wrong? Are you cold? Turn around. OK. Want milk in your tea? Here. Thanks. You're kind. You aren't like those other guys. I... I... Please, let me go. You understand, right? I have a job to do. Right? No! Ah, that's right! Along with the transparent wind In your arms... I'm still sleeping. The child has lost her way in the wind And now she frolics all around here. I love this song of yours! Turn it off! Stop it! - What's wrong? - No! Stop! Stop it! Let me out! Be quiet! Stop it! I want to do you. No! Stop! Damn it! Stop! Dragonfly, you can do it after all! No! Wow! They're still going! Hey! Jack Daniels? Blow on these for me? OK. You look like you want something. I'm looking for the owner of a Jeep. with a Yokohama license plate, number S-1112. Thanks. Well? Tell me. Are you with Hoshino? How'd you know? I thought he'd send someone a little more intimidating. I'm just a writer for a scandal rag. I'm down there with the ticks and cockroaches. Have you heard the strange rumors? Miki Yoko's in the hospital with appendicitis. No, it was a sudden stomach ulcer. That's the big lie. It's Hoshino's false story. So you want to threaten Hoshino? Would that drive the price up? You've got guts. For you, just two bills will be fine. Really? Shit! You bastard! If you want to bump someone off, you have to try a little harder than that! What are you going to do? You want to put the screws on me? No. I hate violence. What's wrong? Two bills isn't enough? Ow! It's magnificent, just like your nose. For you, it's free. That tickles! Do you like it? You ought to drop in again sometime. Is it as magnificent as my nose? Down there is even more magnificent. Your moustache is scratching me! Sorry! Wow! That feels so good! Do me any way you want! What do you think, Shinji? You could never be a man like him. Damn it! Hmm... So this is where she is. Are you set on bringing her back, no matter what? Can you pay me 5 million yen? You're reckless until the end. I don't want to mess with Hoshino. Give Yoko back to him. Shinji gave his permission, too. Dragonfly! Lift up the blanket. No! - You idiot! - No! - No! - Stupid! You bastard! You think you can just do whatever you want with her? No! I'm helping her! What? She was acting so violently! So I... Was she on stimulants? Seems like something Hoshino would do. That's not true! I'll help her! - Stop it! - Shut up! Stop it! Well, don't you see the needle marks? Hurry up and get her clothes. If you take her back to Hoshino, worse things are going to happen. You think I don't know that? Do you know? Where did Hoshino inject her with drugs? Sister! Shinji! Run! - Are there any other exits? - That's the only one! - Open up! - Hurry, get the locker! Open up! Push! Keep pushing! What do you think you're doing? Where's the money? You bastard! Run! You bastard! Damn it... Hand Yoko over to me! Dragonfly! You bastard! It hurts! Watch out! No! Yoko! Let me go! Knock it off! You'll get us killed! You idiot! Yoko's there? Bring her back here now, and I'll pay you 5 million yen, like we agreed. No way. 5 million isn't enough for me to hand her over to you any more. You made me mad. How much? Tell me! 20 million. And not one yen less. 20 million? You idiot! Then forget about it. I'll just bring Yoko, growling like a crazy person, to the press conference. All right. 20 million yen. That's the smart thing to do. Get the 20 million ready, in cash... and bring it to the Kounan Police Department at exactly 10:30. What? You've tried some dirty tricks before. We'll do the transaction in front of the police department. Come alone. If I see any other weird guys around, I'll go straight to the cops. That little brat! Drink this. Don't even think of escaping. Put this on. Where did Hoshino inject you with the drugs? What do you want? What is it? You've been in touch with Miyake Toru, haven't you? I don't know anything! Talk! I don't know anything! Oh, in your heart there's a devil living inside. Ooh, if you're lost just leave it to me. I don't want to go back home. I don't want to go back... to that guy's place. In a sudden, heated moment, the man and woman argue: is it love or is it passion? Oh, tonight we make a toast to that mysterious devil. When you said you didn't want to go home, were you serious? The price for you has jumped to 20 million yen. No! I don't want to! Hey! Miyake, wait! We can still turn back. What do you want to do? What do you want? Isn't 20 million worth a lot to you? Come in. What's so funny? Are you set on bringing her back, no matter what? You're reckless until the end. So this body is worth 20 million yen? Prepare yourself. They won't give you up so easily. What are you two doing? No! Leave her alone! Stop it! I don't want to go! Let me go! Miyake Toru... What an idiot! It's all right now, Yoko. You've come home to me again. Well, Yoko, are you ready to be busy again? Tomorrow the war begins. That person in the bar in Yokosuka... What did you do with him? We'd better shoot you up in a different spot. Well, do you feel better? I'm full of you! Why'd you bring me here? Why'd you bring me here? Yoko... I really love you. More! Let's get dirtier! More! Stop! That's great! I love you! I love you!
