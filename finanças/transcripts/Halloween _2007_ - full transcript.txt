How are you? ls this her? Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis. l took the liberty of calling him in. - Happens to be a child psychologist-- - Thank you, Jim. Psychologist?

We only want the best for the child. Please don't take offense. Please, sit down. Sit down. Thank you. Look, uh, Miss Myers... we found this... in Michael's school bag. Come on. Big deal. He found a dead cat. And these. What is that? l hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers. Oh, God. Oh, this is really sick. Are you saying Michael did this? Michael loves animals. He-- Why would he do this? Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting or causing pain to smaller creatures, it's often an early warning sign. Early warning sign for what? For much deeper and bigger problems. [Mrs. Myers] What do you mean problems? What is this? [Loomis] He's a very disturbed young man. l have to evaluate him, and l'd like to interview him. l need to take him through a series of tests. [Mrs. Myers] Well, you can talk to him, but what does-- what does evaluating him-- what does that mean? [Loomis] Obviously, he's a very deranged young mind that can do this to his pets. [Mrs. Myers] You don't know that he did that. Fuck, man, if l get one more fucking detention, l'll be fucking expelled. My old man's gonna beat my ass. We gotta get that piece of shit on the weekend so we don't get in trouble. Dude, if l see that Myers pussy, he's fucking dead. You want it? Huh? Do you want it? Aah! Ow! What the fuck?

[sirens approaching] [chattering, indistinct] [screaming] ...in connection with tonight's brutal murders. [screaming] [Reporter] ...the Myers family, and was described by police as Manson-like in its viciousness, and more horrific than anything Hollywood could imagine. Judith Myers' nude body was found lying face-down in a pool of blood in an upstairs hallway. Apparently she had been stabbed 1 7 times. Her boyfriend Steven Haley's body was found in the kitchen downstairs, the victim of an apparent vicious beating with an aluminum baseball bat. Along with Myers, a third victim, Ronnie White, who was found bound to a chair, White's neck slit wide open with a kitchen knife and stabbed numerous times in the face and chest. Of course we'll have much more on this horrific story as it develops. But for now, three people brutally murdered, and a 10-year-old boy, Michael Myers, being held in custody. [Reporter] Late last night, 1 0-year-old Michael Myers was transferred after being found guilty of first-degree murder. Myers' verdict comes after one of the lengthiest and most expensive trials in the state's history. ln attendance during this trial, Dr. Samuel Loomis. Loomis has now been appointed by Judge Masterson to oversee Myers' care while incarcerated here at Smith's Grove. Hello, hello, hello. Can you talk in there? Hi, l'm Michael Myers. Okay, okay. That's fine. That's good. That's good. Okay, we're on. How are you feeling today? Good. Could l ask you something? You can ask me whatever you want. That's why l'm here. lf you have anything on your mind, feel free-- anything. Okay. Why do you talk so funny? Talk so funny? Tell me, Michael, what do you remember about... that night, Halloween? What do you mean, like my costume and candy? So you remember nothing about the killing? You remember nothing about getting a knife? - l didn't do that. - Oh, okay. But you were covered in blood. Whose blood was it? l don't know. [Michael] Can l go home today? [Mrs. Myers] No, not today. [Michael] Tomorrow? l don't know. l have to talk to the doctor about that. [classical music playing on PA] - Hey, Mommy. - Yeah. ls everyone at home okay? Everything's okay at home. Okay. Hey, Mikey. How you doing? Look, you can't let those walls get you down. Believe me, l know. l spent a little time behind walls. l know they can drive you crazy. You gotta look beyond the walls. You know, learn to live inside your head. Hey, there's no walls that can stop you there. All right, l gotta get back to work. Now you take it easy, Mikey. Look at my mask. Oh, wow. Beautiful. Yeah. Why is it all black? 'Cause it's one of my favorite colors. Well, actually black isn't a color, is it? lt's the absence of color. ln the spectrum of colors, you go from black, which is no color, all the way through to white, which is every color. So technically-- not that it really matters-- but black isn't a color. Why did you make it? l have my secrets. Wait a minute. l thought we had no secrets, you and l. Because no one sees me. Yes, they do. l see you every day. Your mom, she comes every week. Anybody else? No. Do you like my mask? When did you make this? Just yesterday. l like the mask because it hides my face. l don't like you to hide your face. Take it off. lt hides my ugliness. Sweetie, don't say that. Take it off. You're not ugly. Don't talk like that, okay? Okay. l miss you so much. l miss you, too. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly, Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ Fuck you! Fuck you all! - l hate you! - Let it out!

[classical music playing on PA] Well, before l go, l brought you something. l found it. l thought you might like to hang it up in your room. l thought you'd like it. Well, l guess l'll see you next week. l'll walk you to the car. Bye, sweetie. Nurse, sit with Michael. l'm taking Mrs. Myers to her car. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Cute baby.

God damn, l wouldn't want to bum the freak out. Sorry about these chains, Mikey. What do you mean, you're sorry about these chains? You got feelings for this big idiot, is that what it is? What's the dig goin' on, lsmael? What the fuck, man? You know what? l've been taking care of this kid for almost 20 years. And me and him-- You know what? Never mind. Just shut up, man. Just keep your hands off his things. [Loomis] l really don't know what else to say, Michael. You haven't said a word for 15 years. Christ, that's a lifetime. That's nearly twice as long as my first marriage. Wow. lt's strange, Michael. ln a weird way, you've become like... ...like my best friend. lt just shows you how fucked up my life is. l've done all l possibly can for you. So l'm sorry to tell you that this is going to be my last day. Michael... l have to move on. l'm sorry. These eyes will deceive you. They will destroy you. They will take from you your innocence... your pride... and eventually your soul. These eyes do not see what you and l see. Behind these eyes one finds only blackness, the absence of light.

Bye. So cute. l cannot believe you're graduating this year. l remember when you used to run around looking like that. Mom, l was never a princess. Last thing l was at their age was dead Little Red Riding Hood. You were this beautiful ballerina-- No, you bought me the blood and you gave me the cuts. ''My costume's too tight.'' - You don't remember that? - l never wore a tutu. You getting many kids? Only two so far. Listen... be careful tonight. l know. A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween. Dad, l'm just going to be babysitting. - What's the worse thing l could do? - All right, okay. - l'm just saying. - Nice. - All right. - Sorry. - Aah! - Mom, st-- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Strode! - Hey, Annie. - Hey. How's your dad? Oh, you know, same as always. - You know what that means? - Mm-mmm. Yeah. Love you guys! - Love you, too! - Bye-bye! Gonna give me some lovin'? l'll give you some lovin' later, but first you're going to talk about the vacation. l'm going to go build a fire. Vacation. l hate vacation. Let's stay home. Aaahhh! No! No! You leave my baby alone, you-- [crack] Laurie? ls the Boogey Man real? Why are you so obsessed with the Boogey Man, Tommy? - Well, l hear things at school. - Like what? Well, l heard that on Halloween night, the Boogey Man sneaks out and attacks kids who don't believe. You know what, Tommy? lt is true. He likes to eat little boys like you. Oh, my God! The Boogey Man's here! We're going to die! [telephone rings] Hold that thought. That's not appropriate babysitter behavior, Laurie. Hello? Shut up. - My parents will hear about this one. - Yo, it's me. Hey. So the Wallaces are finally out of my face. l just talked to Paul. He's on his way over. So l'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba her popcorn, and then l will be over. l have some fun and exciting news for you, so l'll see you in a few minutes. Okay, bye. - Guess what, Tommy. - What? Lindsey Wallace is coming over. What? She can't come over here! - What if the guys see her? - So? One, she's a girl. Two, she's not a boy. And three, she smells like you. This is going to be a long night. For the both of us. [man on TV] Get the firel Watch it, Patrickl Lindsey...get your coat on. We're going to go over and see Tommy Doyal. Okay. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Yeah, exactly. l said get your coat on. We're going over to your late-night lover Tommy Doyal's house. No, you didn't. Yes, l did. No, you didn't. Don, l'm sorry if l don't sound too concerned, but a dead coyote and a missing headstone doesn't prove anything. Well, l think you're wrong, Sheriff. l think it does prove that he's here in Haddonfield. lt was a Halloween prank. Kids pull shit like that all the time. The stone will be returned tomorrow. And besides, it weighs over half a ton. That's my point exactly. So you're saying that one man picked it up and walked away with it? Yes. Doc, l may have been born, but l wasn't born yesterday. l'm sorry, Sheriff, but please listen to me. This may be a matter of life and death. All right, l'll tell you what l'll do. You come by my office tomorrow-- Tomorrow is too late. Evil is here. lt's walking amongst us. Doc, it sounds to me like you're talking about the Antichrist. Well, perhaps l am. Smell my feet Give me something good to eat lf you don't, l don't care l'll pull down Annie's underwear l can't believe you're making me haul this thing all the way over there. l can't believe you think l'm not going to tell. Gonna share some popcorn with your little boyfriend? No, l'm not. You know you are. You know you're going to share something with Paul. You know how annoying you are? How? Trick or treat, smell my feet. Give me something good to eat - lf you don't, l don't care-- - l swear to God, Lindsey. lf you don't stop singing that song, we're going to have a pumpkin-smashing party right here in the middle of the street. [doorbell rings] Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie? Laurie's not my girlfriend. l hate girls. Why doesn't anyone understand this? Good. So does Lindsey. Go worship your god. - Hey. - Brought you a present. Thanks. You, my dear, will be happy to know that l talked to Paul about his buddy Ben Tramer. Oh, l thought you said Ben Tramer was retarded. Yeah, but he's not Shortbus retarded or anything. What? He's okay. - l mean, you need a boyfriend! - Annie, l don't need a boyfriend. - No, that's not what l meant. - l'm fine. - You need-- - Okay, Annie-- Oh! Oh! Yes! Yes, Annie! Okay, ok-- All right, you're right. l need a boyfriend. So, what did he say? He said, and l quote, ''Dude, she's fucking hot.'' - Really? - Uh-huh. [honks horn] Oh, fuck, that's Paul. l gotta go. - Have fun. - Thanks, l will. - Bye, sexy. - Bye. Hi, baby. - What's up? - How are you? l'm good. How are you? Good. Dr. Loomis, l'm going to have to level with you. l read your book. l know exactly who you are, and frankly, l don't like you. And l'll tell you something else. l think you have created quite the masterpiece of a monster off the blood of this town, because monsters sell books. Please, just look at this photograph on the cover of the book. All right. l first met Michael 1 7 years ago. He has no conscience, no reasoning, even a rudimentary sense of life or death, right or wrong. Yeah. He's come back for her. And who is her? He's come back for his baby sister. l know it in my bones, Sheriff. To do what? l don't know, Sheriff, but... it's not good. lf l break a promise l made a long time ago, then you must promise that you will play it razor, and l mean razor, straight with me. [telephone rings] [Mr. Strode, on machine] Hello. You have reached the Strode residence. [Mrs. Strode] We can't come to the phone right now. [Mr. Strode] So please leave a message and have a... [both] Happy Halloweenl [beep] Yeah, this is Sheriff Brackett. Hello? lf you can hear me, pick up. Please, if you can hear me, l need to talk to you immediately. [hangs up phone] Let's go. - Laurie? - What, Tommy? l would like to return to the subject we started earlier this evening. l've heard all about this. What do you want to know, Tommy? Why would he only attack kids who don't believe? l mean, it doesn't make sense. ls it because if you believe, then you're protected by his powers? Okay, Tommy, enough about the Boogey Man. lt's nonsense. l'm with Tommy on this one. Yeah. Why do you keep avoiding the subject, Laurie? ls-- ls she scared? - Maybe she is. - Ooh, yeah. - Maybe you're scared! - Are you scared? Okay, stop! Stop! Leave me alone for five seconds, please. - Five, four, three... - You guys... - Okay, please don't. - Two, one. No! No! l'm going to tell your parents! Hey, don't pull it like that. You're going to stretch it all out. - Come on, munchie. - Stop. This is expensive, idiot. - You want to fuck me? - Yeah. - Yeah? - You're so fucking hot, babe. You want to fuck me? l want to hear you say it. - l'm gonna fuck you. - Yeah? Say it again. lt's so fucking warm. Oh, my-- What's the matter? [screaming] [dogs barking] [moaning] [crying] About 1 7 years ago, l respond to a 91 1 which turned out to be the Myers woman's suicide. And l see this beautiful, innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess, and l can't imagine this child growing up with a stigma around her neck, so l omit her from the report, l drive her to another town, and drop her off at the nearest emergency room. And l think that this is going to be the end of it. About three months later, l find out from a friend of mine, Mason Strode, that he's adopted the baby. Oh, my God. - Cold? - Yeah. Okay, come here. - Did you have fun? - Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Annie? We're coming in. You better be decent. - Where are the lights? - Here. [screams] Annie! Oh, my God! Lindsey, run home! Go call the police! Go! Help! Help! Help! Oh, my God, honey! Are you okay? Oh, baby, what happened? - He's in-- - l'm going to call the police. Okay? l promise. Shit! - 91 1. - l need an ambulance, please! My friend's bleeding to death. [crying] Laurie! Laurie! Laurie! My name is Laurie Strode, and l'm at 1987 Winchester Drive. We have a 91 1 call, 1 987 Winchester Drive. This is Brackett. What's the nature of the emergency and who called it in? Two-stabbing-victim call placed by a Laurie Strode. He's found her! He's found her, for God's sake! - How long's it going to take to get there? - lt's about ten minutes. Laurie! Please, you've got to help her. Laurie! Baby! Baby, hold on, okay?

Please, just unlock the door. Yeah, hold on. - No! - Open the door. Oh, God! Freeze! Aah! [screaming] [sirens approaching] Stay behind me. Annie? Sweetie? Annie. Annie. Oh, sweetie. Stay with me. Stay with me. They'll be here soon. Come on, darling. Jesus. Over here! lnside here! - Boogey Man! - Help! Guys, over here! - The Boogey Man! - What is it? Help! The Boogey Man! - What?
