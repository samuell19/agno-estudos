[piano music plays] [electricity buzzes] [dramatic music plays] [narrator] The history of our home is fascinating. It was built in a belly of the mountain dedicated to Soranus, an ancient God of the underworld. 1937. Mussolini started to dig the Bunker. [crowd cheering] 1944. The Second World War was won. The Great Germany was finally built and peace spread all over Europe. [jets roaring] 1957. The coward Americans dropped nuclear warheads on our land... ...forcing the Fuhrer, to retaliate with weapons of our own. [wind howls] The third nuclear war swept the globe, leaving a toxic wasteland in its wake. In 1958, we must shelter from the radiations. For the last year of your lives you have been living here in the Monte Soratte Bunker. That means you were chosen. Little of the world we once knew remains. But that is good. It gives us the chance to start anew. [upbeat music plays] [man singing in German] [man over PA] Day 376 in the Soratte Bunker. This is your daily briefing. Our radio teams work tirelessly, but there is still no news from the Fatherland. So we must continue to do all we can to protect the future of the Fourth Reich. Life worthy of life. Our children, our race. [all] Our children, our race. [music continues] [music ends] And it's done. I think you'll be all right. [ominous music plays] Anybody there? [guard] Freeze! Or I will shoot! I've done nothing wrong! - Easy. - Hey, you can't do this! - [guard] Shut it. - [Gregorio grunts] Citizens, I interrupt your daily broadcast to bring you great news. One of our member has been caught in a brazen act of sabotage. Thanks to the vigilance of each and everyone, the seditious elements of our community have been spotted on time. Our struggle against rebellion terrorism will remain restless. Every citizen is to report to the central meeting chamber immediately. The consequence for breaking the rules must be decided by us all. Citizens, welcome. You are summoned here today to make a choice about the fate of a traitor. You are accused of standing in the way of the re-population program... [Gregorio] Eugenics. That's what your program is. Call a spade a spade. What spade? This is no spade. Our community agrees to pass on only the best genes, only life, worthy of life, to create the Fourth Reich! But you... were caught randomizing results. How do you plead? [Gregorio] Guilty. [all clamoring] [Gregorio] What we're doing here is wrong. History will judge us. History... is no more. Our children, our race! [all] Our children, our race. You're sleep walking into a regime that treats you like automatons! Like guinea pigs! Motherhood is my duty, traitor! Enough. Did you work alone? Yes. We... don't believe your words. But first we will finish with you, then we'll flush out the other rebel rats. So... Those in favor of the special treatment? No! - Jenny! - Take her away. Leave her out of this! Shh. Silence! [Jenny] You're murderers, all of you. - Murderers! - Bye-bye, baby? No, she's good stock. It is decided. [Gregorio] No. Not like this! No! [door slams shut] No! Please! - [gas hissing] - You'll never get rid of me! [coughing] [gasps] [choking sounds] [crunching] [baby crying] Who's there? Hello? [distant squeaking] [Laura shudders] [baby crying] [Laura exhales] [cradle squeaking louder] [baby cooing, laughing] [Laura] Hey... [baby laughing] [gasps] [panting] [vomits] [coughing] [toilet flushes] [spits] [door slams] [sighs] How are you, Laura? Please, it's not the right moment. Stop. [grunts] [panting] Put your hand on my neck. Like this? I can still speak so... [gasps] Oh. Sorry for that. No, you're not. If it ever gets too much, just say it. - I'm pregnant. - [laughs] So you're a fine specimen of fertility, citizen! No, really. I took a test last week. [laughing] Jesus. Okay. Okay, uh... I want weekends. - What? - With the kid. Yeah, so I can, you know, I get to teach him how to ride a bike. - "Him"? - I'm just speculating. Well speculate away. I'm not keeping it. Well, I get a say, too, though, right? So what's the plan? Ferry the kid back and forth from New York? You're still going? I've already signed my contract. Well, fuck it. Will you just try? I'm not throwing away everything to be a mother. Wow. - I thought you said you loved me? - [Laura scoffs] Of course, I love you. But we're not exactly "happy family" material, are we? No, we're not "happy family" material but who cares? Are you trying to tell me you haven't slept with anyone else since we started whatever this is? The LARP's nearly over, Greg, it's time to stop pretending. I don't pretend with you. I never did. Tomorrow we're leaving. We're going to talk about this, Laura, hmm? But first we go out in style. - What's that supposed to mean? - Hmm. There's so much history here. Can you feel it? The Bunker shudders with the weight of it. This place... it swallows you. It brings out who we really are. Poetic. Thanks. Are you certain you're not ready for the ending I've got planned? As long as it's not "convince Laura to keep the fetus." Trust me. Look around you. What do you see? Hmm? All these people with legs, they don't have what you have. Your people have good muscles. Really? They're good at the sports, running, jumping and... Punching. Hmm. [spoon clatters] Just imagine what we can do once we figure out how to isolate those genes. Soldier! You're just in time. Our good chancellor here was explaining the finer nuances of his ideology. Not a topic for young girls, I think. That's funny, I don't see any young girls. You can play dress up as you want, but you aren't fooling anyone. You're just making a fool of yourself. [plate clatters] I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you? That was out of order. I signed up for this... Even if I knew this wasn't going to be easy. - Didn't I? - Yes, but we're in a game. There are lines that shouldn't be crossed. He shouldn't be attacking who you are. You are not your role. [all gasp] - [man] Gracious. - [Robin] What's going on? - [man] What's happening? - [woman] What's going on? - [Marcus] Hey. - Huh? [speaks French] I don't speak French. "You are your life, nothing else." Misgendered Nazi it is then. That's just great. I'm glad you came with me. I know these guys can be intense, but... it's a nice change from the usual Saturday night in Sheffield. Um, what is this... "Chef Field" of which you speak, citizen? Tell me of this "field of Chefs". The food must be amazing. Indeed. You know, you don't need it, right? The makeup. Mm-hmm. I just like getting the details right. - Bye. - Bye, yeah. Hey. [chuckles] [unlatches locker] Uh, hey, mate, that's Laura's stuff. [sighs] Laura dropped this yesterday. Just returning it. It's all good. So, um, Laura's cousin. how are you finding it? Yeah, uh, Harry. Yeah it's great, yeah. It's hardcore. Yeah. Just, um, keep in mind what I told you, all right? If anything is making you uncomfortable... I'm not uncomfortable. ...you can always leave, mate. And it's over. [under breath] "You can always leave, mate." Shut up. [computers beeping] Team, great job so far. They are loving it. Greg, what are these? Nuh-uh-uh! For Gregorio's eyes only, top secret ending stuff. Greg. Fireworks are not meant to be used underground, so... Yeah, I know. I totally agree with you. [switch blade clicks open] [Gregorio] Oh my God, please don't. Don't do it. Please, I've got a family. [groans] Ha, ha, ha. Right. [Gregorio] Wow. Listen, he's been weird about me being playing a male role and... It just... It feels personal. Okay, so let's just not hire him as staff again. - Sure. - Good. Fuck him. Hey, finding yourself is what we're here for. Is that what you're doing? "Finding yourself"? Precisely. 'Cause from the outside it looks like you're just flirting with every woman who'll have you. I haven't got a clue what you mean. [whispers] I think pregnancy does make women crazy. [Yasmine] All right, let's go setup for the party, Yeah? Hmm. That would fill my heart with joy. [dance music playing in German] What a fascinating device... that definitely doesn't exist yet. Hey, you should eat something. I'm okay, Robin. You know, you're not defined by what you allow yourself to eat. You're bigger than that. Starvation is not a good look. [dance music continues] [music drowns out] [music continues] - Quitting, huh? - Hmm. - Tonight doesn't count. - Oh, yeah? - It's a party. - [chuckles] [Harry] Greetings, bunker folks! Whoa. This is too cool. [Marcus] You want to try? Yeah. Read this. [music stops] "We're nearing the end of the evening, but it's not over yet!" [both laugh] All you lovers out there, - this is your chance to dance! - [crowd cheers] [slow music playing] Laura, may I have this dance? You may. Sorry. Sorry. What do I do, love? Is it like this? Just, uh, repeat. How do you know how to do this? Just... follow the music. Okay. [laughs] Don't step on my feet. Sorry, sorry. What happened? Who did that to you? Gregorio... [laughs] I will never tire of making you uncomfortable, Harry. I-I'm not uncomfortable. Now look, I wasn't going to say anything but clearly you like him but... I saw him kissing another girl. I know. This was fun. I'm gonna go. No, no, wait, wait. I just... I like this song. Me, too. He's not a good guy, Laura. It's my business, not yours. [door closes] Radiation cleared itself up then? Ghost. Immune to radiation. - What were you doing? - Uh... Afterlife stuff. You wouldn't get it. What are you doing here? There's a red-head girl who's stalking me. Huh. Interesting. You see there's this theory I studied. Um, The dark is a canvas onto which we paint our deepest fears. Paranormal. Hallucination. Paranoia. It can all be fabricated by our own brains. You give the mind a few tiny suggestions to work with, and the dark does the rest. We make our own fears real. I've never felt alone in this bunker. Is that weird? Nah. Right. At least you're not alone in that. [electricity buzzes] - [laughs] - Oh, fuck me. All right. Better if I go and check the electrics. - You need any help? - Nah. [indistinct chatter] [slow music playing] [distorted heart beat] [all gasp] What's going on, our Chancellor? We're all very concerned. [man] No electricity means no oxygen! This is... a sabotage by the rebels. [all gasp] Have you seen Greg? He went to check the lights. "We don't need to check the basic electrical systems" he says. [creaking] [Robin] I mean, I swear. [cracking] [all scream] What? What? No! [all clamoring] Okay, we're gonna have to evacuate. What the hell, we were supposed to start a revolution here! [Yasmine] Okay! Safety first. We're ending the LARP early. Come on! Everyone out! Now! Come on, now! Go! Go, go! [Andrei] Come on, let's go! This way! [Yasmine] Okay, LARPers, we're going through the corridor. Follow me. [guard] Let's go! [Yasmine] Stay together, everybody. Watch your step. [Laura] Follow Yasmine. Straight ahead. Go, go. [Yasmine] Mind your steps. [Laura] Right. Good. Come on. [Yasmine] Stay calm, everyone. This is the way out. We're almost there. [Laura] Guys, stay together, at the back. [Yasmine] Watch your step everyone. Watch your step. Hey, hey, it's not a tour. Come on, let's go, let's go. Hey, hey. [Yasmine] Careful. This way everyone. [Laura] Stay together. [Jenny] What a pity, I was having fun. - Harry, you're bleeding. - Huh? Oh yeah, it's just... glass. I'm sorry. This is not how I imagined your first ever LARP ending. No, it's just a flesh wound. You know, you've got tales to tell when you return to the Field of Chefs. Yeah. Wait, you're not coming? Um, 'cause I'm staff, I'll need to help clear up. Yeah, cleaning up will take a while I'm thinking I'll just crash here tonight. - Yeah, me too. - Don't worry, I'm not going to ask you to put your poor back through another night on the bunks. Go. I'll meet you in the hotel tomorrow. No, no, it's all good, man. You know, if... if you're gonna stay then... I can stay. Okay, come. [Harry] Besides, someone needs to look out for you. [Yasmine] Cute. Oh, I loved that so much better than this one. [indistinct chatter] [Yasmine] When you're not with 100 LARPers, this place looks different. But at least I don't have to wear that stupid belly anymore. [dramatic music playing] Where's Gregorio? [Robin] No idea. I can't find anything wrong with the lights at this end. The fuses are all fine. [Laura] What happened then? The Bunker's electrics are ancient. So... it could have been just a power surge. Or... Or what? Greg cut the lights himself. Mass panic for a big finale. No. He was really excited about the ending. He told me it was going to be something special. As I said, mass panic. [Robin] Okay. Please, Yasmine. Come on. Give him some credit, will ya? Did he say exactly where he was going? To "check the electrics." He was headed for the anti-atomic door. What if something happened to him? [Yasmine] Like what? [Laura] It is weird he's not back by now. Isn't he just hiding to avoid clean up? Yeah, it could be. All the more reason to help look for him, right? [doors slam shut] Okay, so we've been LARPing in the anti-atomic sector, which is here. but the rest of the Bunker is much bigger. And older. Greg said not to go too far down the tunnels. Some of them are unstable and... that you could lose your sense of direction. So I guess he has to be in one of them. [ominous music playing] [Laura] Greg? [Yasmine] If he's hiding somewhere I swear to God... - [Laura] He wouldn't. - [Marcus] Oh, no? Remember that time he got us stuck on a boat? That time he retrieved the anchor to make it more authentic? To be fair, we did all say it'd be cool if we were really stranded. That doesn't sound very safe. Hey, you want to relax, book a resort, don't go LARPing. [Harry] Yeah, I'm getting that, yeah. [Yasmine] A lot of people like it, you know? And living someone else's life for a few days. It's not for real, but you still get to experience... the horror of it. [Marcus] Actually it is still here, this Nazi ideology. And we can condemn easily from armchairs. But do you know where would you stand? [Yasmine] Well, turns out rebelling was not on my character's objectives list. - Orders! - Ah, orders, right. But silence, inaction... this is still an act. [Andrei] What's wrong with these lights? [doors slam] [Andrei] Fucking hell! [Yasmine] You're very clever, Greg. You can come out now. [Marcus] How did he set this up on his own? Maybe he had help. [light booms on] - Oh, fuck! - Whoa. ["Star Spangled Banner" playing over radio] [all laughing] [Harry] Guys. [radio static] I suppose it's a good way to get around needing more NPC's. NPC's? Non-player characters. [Robin] He could at least have told his staff. [Yasmine] Maybe he wanted to surprise us, too. [Laura] Hmm. So, what? The end of the LARP was going to have everyone shot by Americans? [Yasmine] I mean, it makes sense. We were playing Nazis. [Robin] It's also what happened, you know. Americans stormed this base, so... We... we should leave. Now. Come on, Harry Baby. Didn't you stay to look after us? [radio static] [Yasmine] If he's not injured by the time we find him, I'm gonna fuck him up myself for wasting our time. But... What if we weren't in the game? [Yasmine] We'll look for ten more minutes, then call 113, and Greg can explain to the people from emergency why he got carried away playing Nazis. Mes amis, unfortunately my wheelchair is not a 4x4. I'll have to let you have fun here. Harry, let's check it out. [Harry] Um, okay. And Greg probably wants us to separate. [suspenseful music playing] [wheelchair wheels squeaking] [Harry] Yeah, that bit's closed. Uh, yeah, it's definitely been ten minutes! We should probably head back now. No, wait! I bet this is where Greg went when the lights went off. [Harry] But he's not here. [echoes] Gregorio? This has been opened recently. - Huh? - Look at the scrapes. - There's no dust. - Laura... No, stop. Come on. What if he's hurt in there? Why would he have gone in? Look, there's a "Danger: No Entry" sign! [gate unlocks] Laura, you're not serious. Come on. Laura! [water dripping] - [screams] - [yells] [Robin laughs] Fucking scared me! [laughs] I'm sorry that was funny. Where are you going? [Marcus] Thank you, but I can manage. [laughs] Putain! Putain... [Laura] Greg! [Harry] Laura, come on. [water dripping] Back to the beginning. [Laura] Greg! [Harry] It doesn't look like anyone's been here in years. Laura, come on. This is enough, Laura. I can't let you hurt yourself. I... I was so... so happy that you wanted to share LARPing with me, but this is just too much. I'm asking you to stop now. No one made you follow me. [Harry] This place is dangerous. It's falling apart. [glass shatters] [Laura] Harry! Run! Run! [tense music playing] [Yasmine] What happened? A ghost. "A ghost"? Yes. A fucking ghost. There is no ghost because ghost don't exist. I didn't see any ghosts. Sorry. [Marcus] In the dark, all cats are leopards. [Andrei] Hysteria is very powerful. [Harry] We should get you out of here. [Marcus] A little bit of fear never hurt anyone. From a medical perspective, horror can technically scare you to death. The brain usually regulates fear but in extreme cases, the whole system's overridden. The resulting flood of chemicals into the bloodstream can be enough to cause strokes or heart attacks. - Friends... - Fear can kill you. She's fucking with you. I mean, it's pretty rare. But it can happen. [Laura] None of this explains where Greg is. Okay, come on. Come on, action. Plan B. There's no point staying here. We're leaving. [Laura] Really? [Harry] Let's go. Yeah, let's go. [ominous music playing] [Robin] It's locked. - [Yasmine mutters] Shit. - [Harry] What do you mean, "locked"? [Yasmine] I think that we're pretty clear, champ. - Where's the key? Who has the fucking key? - [Andrei] It's locked. Help! Help! - Can anyone hear us? - [Yasmine] No one can hear you. [Harry] No. I got it. - [Yasmine] Harry! - [grunts] - Harry, stop! - [grunts] Fascists built this door. They did not use flimsy doors. Is this what gets Greg off? Locking us in a Bunker and forcing us to play the end of his stupid LARP? What? No! Come on. What've we had so far? The "Americans", the ghost. And now we're here. Feels like a shitty game to me. Oh, come on. Greg could be really hurt somewhere. Why are we arguing about this? Then who locked the door? Okay, I don't know if this is Greg, or an actual fuck up, but anyway, Robin? The old radio equipment, does she work? I don't know. Good question. How about give it a try? Yup. Okay. [pans clatter] [metal clinks] There. It's there? [chuckles] Yeah. This is awesome. Thanks. [Marcus] Make us proud. You know I will. See ya. Still going with "Greg's hurt somewhere?" [woman singing in Italian] [Yasmine] What is that? "Parlami d'amore Mariuù". What? It's an Italian song from the 30s. Marcus finally made a good choice. It doesn't sound like it's coming from the speakers. [woman singing in Italian over speakers] [Laura scoffs] What is it? The drive's full. [Greg recorded] Hey, Laura, I hope you enjoy the end of our game. It's going to be wild. Make the most of everything while you can. Then go be a big girl in New York if you want. But only if you make it out alive... [evil laughs] Joking, love ya. I knew it! He didn't tell me anything. [Andrei] Everyone's gone. There can be no Nazi Bunker game without players. [Laura] Maybe this is his weird way of finishing the game... Laura? [Gregorio] Hey Laura, I hope you enjoy the end of our game. It's going to be wild. [door slams shut] [Yasmine] Greg? Laura? Stop fucking around. [door opens] What the hell?! [tense music playing] [clicks on] [cracking] [water running] [scratching] [scurries] [suspenseful music playing] Hello? Hello? [radio static] Hello? [man speaking foreign language over radio] Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We are locked in the Soratte Bunker. We need assistance. - [man speaking foreign language] - We need assistance. [phone ringing] Hello? [indistinct music through telephone] Hello? [glass cracking] [shatters] [glass cracking] [indistinct chatter] [en allemand] Angel, sing for us. [whispers] Clara, I could die within a month. [sings in Italian] [gunshots] [Harry] Hey, hey, hey. - [gasps] - Hey. Hey. Hey. You fainted, must've hit your head on the way down. No don't stand up. Don't. [gasps] I saw her again. The ghost. Her name's Clara. Something's happened. What? Harry, what? Hey. [Yasmine] Where is he? One of his friends is dead. That's right. He doesn't know yet. You haven't had a chance to tip him off, have you? I told you I don't know where he is! Laura, tell them what happened. With Clara. I saw the ghost again. - [Andrei] Enough of this! - [Harry] Let her finish! I had a vision. We were in the 40s, it was the same woman. Clara. She had red hair, she was... She was pregnant. You poor deranged girl. [Laura] I'm not lying. The game stops now. If you're working with him, then Robin's blood is on your hands, too. - What's your problem? - You're my problem! [Harry] Yasmine, cut it out. One of us just died. You can be her knight in shining amour all you like, she's never going to sleep with you. He's my cousin! Okay, if you're done with this fucking theater, - let's calm down. - [Harry] Okay. So what now, then? Friends, let's show some respect. I call it the... "My friend Robin somehow is dead so I'm desperate" martini. Robin was gonna show me around Rome after the LARP. Berlin, too. We had a game there next month. Before my accident, I never even went abroad. But life is short and... what else is there? You know, try stuff out! What is the worst that can... I'm the one who told Robin go check on the radio. Voilà. It's my special mix. [glasses clink] Top secret ingredients. It's quite good, no? I'm not in the mood. Don't make me drink alone, Laura. Come on. I can't. [sips] I'm pregnant. [scoffs] For real. I'll drink to your baby, then. But promise me you will do everything to make him see the sunlight. I need to go to the toilet. Excusez-moi. He needs help. No. I think I'm old enough. But thank you, my dear. I'm sorry I told you like this. I... I didn't mean to tell anyone. No, you don't have to apologize. [slams door] [tense music playing] [clatters] I'm sorry, Robin. I'm sorry. [Yasmine] How did he set it all up? He can't have done it alone. [Andrei] I thought it was the little girl, but now she is dead. You know, we aren't really in the 1950s. You don't really have to be an asshole. [slides box] [blows] Robin was non-binary. And kindly asked us to use the pronoun "They." Oh, it looks like archive footage. Maybe it shows another way out. Oh. [laughs] All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on, Marcus. Marcus, Marcus. Got it. [sighs] [clicks] Whoa. [sizzles] [yells] Laura! Shit! Laura! God! Laura! There must be another way out. [Laura] Maybe we missed something. What? Laura! Ah! Ah! [screams] [water running] [gasps] [coughing] [crying] This is SS Feldmarschall Kesserling. Commander of the German troops stationed in Italy. After the armistice of September 8th, Nazis occupied the Bunker in order to coordinate defense against the Allies who were attacking peninsula from the South. I'm guessing that didn't work out for them. American troops attacked the Bunker. They could not hold out. The American tunneled in and attacked the base. - He walks towards her. - [Harry] Huh? He loves her. He asks her to sings for them. [gasps] [guns fire] [gasps] - [machine guns firing] - [men screaming] [screams] [Harry] Laura? Enough. Make her stop! She's faking it. You stop this now, you fucking crazy woman! - She's pregnant! - Oh, of course, she is. Leave her alone! Ooh, ooh. What are you going to do, huh? Stab me with a toy knife? [grunts] [Andrei] You want this? Stop! [Harry grunts] Open the door... or the next body will be yours. You don't understand! This place is fucking haunted! No, no! [grunts] You Nazi piece of shit. [grunts] [wrench clatters] [grunts] [Yasmine] What's happening? [Andrei grunting] [door locks] [Andrei panting] [shuddering] [speaks in German] Adolf Hitler. [speaks in German] [gasping] [screams] - [screaming] - [knocking] No! [screams] [metal clanging] [Yasmine panting] I saw him... being swept away by something. I know it sounds crazy but, I think Clara's trying to protect me. All those visions... she couldn't have her baby so she wants me to keep mine. [suspenseful music] I need to go and find her. Can you please stay here and take care of Harry? What? If Clara wants to help me, she needs to show me the way out. Please don't leave me alone, I'm terrified. We have no choice. I'll be back. Trust me. Please don't tell anyone I'm freaking out. I'll take good care of him. Don't worry. Go. Thank you. [dramatic music plays] Harry, baby, you're okay. I know. - [grunts] ...Drill in my head. - I know, I know. You took a bad hit but you're gonna be okay. No, don't stand up. Don't stand up. No, don't stand up. Where's Laura? Laura... She'll be back soon, Harry. What have you done to her? Nothing I didn't do anything to her. - What have you done to her? - I didn't do anything. What? Stop it! I'm not lying. - You're lying! - [gasps] [thuds] [water splashes] [Harry panting] Laura! Laura! Laura! [flashlight clatters] [suspenseful music plays] [owl screeches] [door creaks open] Greg? [gasps] [cries] Look at me. [crying] I'll take our baby away from here I promise. [Laura] What have you done? You're in shock. You should probably sit down. Don't. Harry, what did you do? [sobbing] I couldn't just let him hurt you. I asked him to. No. You're... you're self destructive. He took advantage. He never deserved you. So what? Jesus, Harry, so you strangled him? - No, no. This is on you, Laura. - [gasps] You self sabotage and you made a bad choice after bad choice and... I'm not letting you hurt yourself anymore. You have to trust me. - Trust me. - You don't get to decide what I need. You're fucking deluded. [grunts] [grunting] You like it rough, yeah? I can do that! Yeah, is this what you like? Is this what you want? [gasping] Help, Clara. Stop! [choking] Clara! [gasps] [groans] [panting] [Harry] Laura. Laura, I'm sorry. [groans] [ominous music playing] [humming] [orchestral music] [birds chirping] [church bell ringing] [children chattering] [theme music playing]
