Yes, Mom. If you're asking about progress,... ... you'd better ask me directly. Don't ask Tata. She'll get stressed out! Then what should I chat about with my daughter-in-law? That's up to you. Just talk about clothes, food,... ... the 2014 Cabinet. Just don't talk about children. (Natadiningrat & Co.) Fine, we'll talk about the President. The President also just had grandchildren. Okay, that's up to you. I'm calling you to look out for Tata's feelings. You're so caring! Sorry, Mom, I have to drive. I'll hang up. Okay. Drive safely. I hope you kids quickly get pregnant. Look for a model. Beautiful and famous. Someone who's trendy these days and has a lot of fans. - Okay? - How about Shinta? No, no, not her! Not her, please. - You're so sensitive. - Yeah, I'll explain it later. Hey, sorry I'm not working late today. There's something I need to work on. Okay, bye. - Hi, honey. - Honey. - You have the ice pads? - Yes. Welcome to our colleagues in the media. Let's go straight to Markus, Shinta's manager, about our brand. Alright, thank you. Speaking of Lidwina, this is a global brand. We certainly aim at a global market. That is why we need three models. The first is American, second European, and third Asian. From Asia, we've selected Shinta. I think this is also something for Indonesia to be proud of... ... because Shinta was even chosen over artists from Korea. The campaign will start in 2012. What's the value of the contract? I apologize, but the contract value is of course a company secret. But I can tell you right now... ... that Shinta is the model with the highest pay in Asia. - A question, please. - Yes? Is it true that Shinta was divorced by her husband... ... because she can't have children? Sorry, we have no comments for that. This press conference is to talk about Shinta's achievements... ... and not her personal life. So I apologize. Okay, any further questions? Please. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey! How was it? - Did it go well? - Yes. - It was good, huh? - Yes. - Man, I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. Damn, this is like the biggest month in your career. Right? The Lidwina contract is back to back with New York Fashion Week. So, you have to be mentally prepared. - Can you do it? - I'm ready, Kus. - You're sure? - Thanks for your support. Yeah, don't worry about it. You're like family. No, no... There's one more thing. Papers from the courthouse. I'm sorry. (Test Pack You Are My Baby) Honey, why aren't we pregnant yet? It says sperm cells reach its maturity level after three days. Okay, let's have sex three times a day. I don't think you're strong enough. We have to match your calendar to my fertility cycle. But it makes it not fun. I feel like a factory. Let's just try anything. Hi! - Hi, honey! - You're already cooking. - How are you? - Good. - Bean sprouts again? - Yep! For you. A lot for you. Honey... - Put those in the laundry. - Later. Not later. Now. - Put them in the laundry. - After dinner. Okay, a lot of bean sprouts for you. I'm thirsty. Here's ginseng tea for you. And ginger tea for me. The sugar. You don't use sugar? No. They say women can get diabetes from too much sugar. It can be bad for the pregnancy. - Eat. - That's enough. Okay. - No extra peanut sauce? - No. - I'll just take it. - Yes. So how was your day? It was okay. There was... - ... a husband and wife. The Yoyos. - Oh yes? Married for 30 years. They want to divorce. Divorce after 30 years? Why? I don't know. I'm also curious. - We won't be like that, right? - No. Unless there are younger ones. Meaning? - Nothing. - What did you say? I think I heard, "Unless there are younger ones." Hey, you're so silly! You dare to discuss about... Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey, no! Okay, I'm sorry! (Sex Education Romantic Sex) Here, honey. You should use olive oil. It says so. Just mix it with vegetables. Good for a salad. I'm serious. Read it. - But we have no olive oil. - We have brake fluid. No! You're making me laugh. Don't do that. We should be serious. Let's just do it. Come on! Oh my God! Honey? Again? I have to be in this position. Sperm cells should be guided. If not, they'll get lost. - Aren't you sore? - Sperm cells are like soccer fans. They come in crowds. They're disorganized and they don't know the way. They have to be guided like this. This is so it will take and meet with my egg cells. But it's tiring, honey. That's okay. If I don't do this, all that we did will be in vain. Me being beside you is never in vain. We didn't marry just to have children. It's also because I love you. I love you so much, which is why I want to give you a child. You know? Honey. I feel like I'm sleeping with a chicken. Ouch! Just wait! - You keep teasing me when I'm trying. - But still... I won't be long, just five minutes. - Five more minutes. - Just finish up. Again. You... - Come on. - They're still queuing! - So you'll have lots of stock. - I don't want to! - Come on! - I don't want to! Come on! Ow! Honey! See, I lost my position! It's your fault! Mother. Heru. I just want to get my stuff. Heru! You're not going to change? You might get sick. It's too late. Did you get it? I mean the papers. I got them. Thanks. Where are you staying? Still at the hotel? In an apartment. I just bought it. It's still empty. There's only a bed. You have money? Which apartment? Why do you ask? I'm not worthy of you anymore. Goodbye. I'm sorry. Hey, I'm the one who's sorry. Mother. - I'm leaving. - Yes. - Shinta, wait... - Heru! Your father's company needs a successor. You know what you have to do? (Jakarta International Airport Soekarno-Hatta) While I'm in New York, there will be a handyman... - ... to bring furniture to my place. - Okay. When you get home, everything will be ready. You just need to move in. Okay. I'm proud of you, Shin. When I met your sister,... ... she said you weren't as beautiful in college as you are now. - That's right. - Really? - I didn't know how to put on makeup. - Really? - Not even a little bit. - Really? - I have a picture. - Where? Have a look. - Where are you? That's you? - Here. You were so lame. - Who's this? - His name is Rahmat. - My ex. - Ex? He has no regrets that you're famous now? I was the one who left him. Ironically,... ... I left him for Heru. - Okay. This is it, I guess. - Okay. Here. - You take care. - You too. - Safe flight. Okay. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. (Zones 1-6) (Departures) - It's cold! - Sorry, sorry. - Sorry! - It's really cold! Ouch! - Does it have to be like this? - Yes! The one who told me this has three children. It's cold! Honey... I think it's time we went to the doctor, huh? If we go to the doctor, it's like admitting we're not fertile. It's not like we're the one admitting it. All of these are saying it. That's a lot! What brand don't you have yet? I don't have the brands that give me a positive result. (New York Fashion Week) Hey, Shinta. How are you doing? Your agency from New York called. They're very impressed. So, you did a good job. And you asked me to find Rahmat's phone number. I'm still on it, okay? I'll find it for you. - Okay, take care. - I need you on the stage. - Five more minutes, huh? - Bye, Gorgeous. Good morning, Miss Shinta. We're from the clinic and would like to let you know... ... that your test results are ready and you can get them anytime. Thank you. These tests! They're no use! So how was your flight? - It was okay. - Okay. How many hours was it? Quite a while. Almost 24 hours. - That's a long flight. - I know. But everything is pretty okay, right? - Not bad. - Not bad. This is big, you know, for the both of us. - I know. - Yeah. Shin? I'm really sorry. I know you just landed... ... but actually you have a photoshoot at three. - Are you serious? - Yes. But it's fine, right? You're not too tired. - Okay. - Yes! I have to be able to do it. - That's good. - But... I want to stop by the clinic first. - Okay, we have time. - That's good. - Why the clinic? - Getting lab results. (Ella) (Sexy Party Dresses) I'm sorry about your infertility. I recommend you see another doctor for a second opinion. Your opinion is enough. I just need a man who can accept this opinion. Are you finished, Miss Shinta? Yes, thank you. When should I mark as your next appointment? - I don't know yet. - Thank you. - I want that one. - What? - That one. The other one. - Where, this one? Miss Shinta, you left your card. - Miss Arista Natadiningrat? - Yes? Please wait in front of Doctor Peni's room. We were just about to read, Nurse. Please sit. Here, Nurse? - Where? - Over there. - It's close. Man... - Just a minute. Miss Shinta left her card. I'll call later. Thanks. Imagine if the doctor's name was one long word. Do you think there's a Dr. Bre Ast? That's enough, honey. Are you pregnant, Miss? What do you think? Don't laugh. She's really mean. You were being stupid. I thought you might have been too full, Miss. You're so bad! Don't embarrass me. Finished? Let's eat first. Wait, wait... I have this. What you asked for. Darling Rahmat's phone number. I'm amazing, right? - How did you get it? - I'm that good. But just so you know. According to my research,... ... eight out of 10 cases of rekindling old flames end badly. - Whatever. - Do you know what "badly" means? - What? - I don't know either. Miss Arista... - Natadiningrat. - Yes. Just Arista. Your name won't fit. Okay? I'm sorry. So, Arista, are your periods regular? - Yes - Okay, regular periods. How long have you been married? Seven years. Seven years. Do you often have relations? - I guess. - We're active. - Sorry. - That's okay. Do you often have relations? - We're active. - Active. BBM, phone, Twitter, SMS. Sex. Sexual relations. - We're active. - Active. Okay. Do you know the calendar system? Yes. In fact we already consume nutritious foods. About diet and intake, we're already so... I'd like to ask you, Ma'am. Do you have high blood pressure? Only since we married. Yes, I understand now. Sorry. Okay, sir, can you wait here for a while? I'd like to check on your wife. Go ahead, Ma'am. - Don't do anything, honey. - Yes, go ahead. Stay here. Pray for me. Nurse, a little help, please. Yes. Please sit. Thank you. This is my first time. - Your first time? - Yes. Put this on, one arm at a time. - Just relax. - Yes. The chair is a little weird. It's like revving a bike. Like that. Like this... See? It can go up... See? - Let's lower it. - That's enough, Doctor. Yes, yes. Nurse, a hand, please. Yes. Just the gel. Okay. You might feel some pain, but it's just for a little bit. Okay... Nurse, thank you. I will call my assistants. Kids! We will now take a sample from this woman to test her fertility. - Okay. - Come on. - Nurse. - Okay, Doctor. - Excuse me, Ma'am. - Yeah, okay. Relax, Ma'am. Just relax. Take this sample to the lab... ... and have it checked for results. - Go ahead. - Okay, Doctor. Okay, thank you. Okay, we're all done. Nurse, please help her. - We're done? - Yes. So, am I healthy, Doctor? Yes, you're physically healthy. I'm sure the results will be good. I'll send you the results. So what's the next step? We can try IVF. In vitro. I will inject hormones for ovulation. Well? I'm ready. I should warn you that it hurts. It's painful. And you'll also be very emotional... ... because of too much hormones in your body. Well, as long as my husband supports me. Of course. I meant, you shouldn't always bring me to high blood pressure. Okay, we can do it now. IVF requires you to inject... ... the hormone into your own body every day. Of course you can't come to this clinic every day. I'll teach you to inject yourself. Okay... - Can someone else do it for me? - Of course. Or your husband. - Yes, Miss. - Arista Natadiningrat. - It's 900 thousand rupiahs. - Okay. Hello. Hello. Hello. Sorry, Miss, I don't need credit. Rahmat, this is Shinta. Yes, hello. How are you? I'm well. How about you? How are you? I'm well. Shinta, let's change your outfit. - Yes, give me a second. - Okay. Rahmat... I need to hang up. But let's keep in touch. This is my number. Bye. In vi what? In vitro, Mother. Okay, whatever. We're praying it will work. Well, any results? We haven't started yet. This is just the conditioning. Conditioning for what? Conditioning so my body is conducive to having a baby. Don't be too long. I can't wait. Mom. Please try not to ask too much... ... so Tata and I can concentrate. Yes already, just come to Bandung. The air is clean. Maybe the air in Jakarta is dirty. That could also be the cause. Take leave for a few days. We can't, Mom. Tata's being injected with hormones. Take pity on her. Tata shouldn't work too hard. She should come home sooner and take some leave. I'm hanging up, Mom. - What did she say? - Don't think about it. Let's hope it works. Amen. I can't take it anymore! This time I'm serious! If you come near me, I'll hit you! Come here! Try me! You're crazy! You're insane! You think I'm afraid to lose... Sir, she's calling for you. I still want to enjoy the beautiful morning sun. - Tommy J. Pisa. - Pance Pondaag. Sir, this is the right time to repair your relationship with her. - You're her husband. - You're her psychiatrist. Concentrate. Please tell me. I want a divorce from him. Sorry, I have to ask. Why do you want a divorce? They way I see and feel it, we have nothing in common anymore. I'm actually confused about my wife. I don't know what she wants. She wants a divorce from me. She shouldn't be saying that. She says we have nothing in common. Then why did she agree to marry me back then? I thought all this time we had no problems. Right now, you're 50. That's not an age... ... to be a hot item anymore in the singles market. That's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for happiness. People marry just to grow old together and be happy. Right, Mat? But she wants to divorce. I needed 30 years to convince myself... ... that this marriage can work. You're not in love with your husband anymore? Then why did you marry him back then? What? Aren't people supposed to get married? Go to college. Graduate. Become independent. After that, get married. After getting married, you should have kids. Right? Yes, yes... If I may ask, what's your favorite food? Tamarind vegetable soup. Mr Sutoyo,... ... do you feel uncompatible with your wife? I know everything about her. You don't need to ask me that. - What's your favorite food? - Lodeh vegetable soup. The one with jackfruit and coconut milk. Let's close our session. You can go home... Try talking again with your wife. You should also try... ... to better understand her, and vice versa. I can't hold on. Let's do an ultrasound on your womb... ... before we start the IVF. - Go ahead, Nurse. - Yes. - Okay, we're done. - That's it, Doctor? Hopefully it goes well. Thanks, Doctor. Honey. - I hope the IVF works. - Amen. How many days has it been? - It's been... - Six. - Wait. Seven? - Seven. - Seven days, fertilization? - Seven nights. What is it, honey? Nothing. It hurts. My stomach hurts. I feel like... You need to poop? Hold on. Honey? What's wrong? What is it? My period is here, honey. My period is here. It's okay. She's still sad. Yes, yes, I understand. The husband's duty is to calm her down. In moments like this,... ... the husband and wife must support each other. - Definitely, Doctor. - How about next month? I'll schedule the second appointment for next month, okay? Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You're still upset? Let's try again, huh? - Hello. - Hi. - Hi! - How are you? - You look great! - Hi. How was Bangkok? Finally? - Bangkok? - Bangkok is fabulous, like me. - It's fun? - Yes! I told you, fabulous. How long are you staying? - A week. - A week? I'll just get to the point. I'm actually here on a mission. Do you both remember that ad... - That breast milk campaign... - Indonesian breast milk campaign. - The 2009 one. - Yes. My boss saw your ad on Youtube. - Okay. - Thanks, sir. - And? - He's very impressed... ... with your work and wants to recruit you. That's why I intentionally came all the way from Bangkok,... ... even though I'm really busy. I came from Bangkok specifically to come to you. If you guys want an interview, I can set it up. I don't mind leaving my husband. But I can't leave my kid. Your husband... - How about you, Ta? - You, Tata. - Ta, it's Bangkok. - Come on! Big money. It's the center of advertising in Southeast Asia. I'm this fabulous because I'm in Bangkok. Yes, but... What can I do? I'm doing IVF right now. We're really trying to have children. I can't suddenly leave my husband. Our effort will be in vain. This one has a husband and kids. This one has a husband. - And trying to have kids. - That's how it is... That's what happens after you have kids. You two... This is a golden opportunity. It's a big opportunity. - I... - Yes, but... It's not that I'm saying no to a big opportunity. It's just not the right time. Okay, it's like this. Okay. You're really saying no, right? Okay, fine, Ta. This is my number. If you change your mind, you have to call me. Just have a kid in Bangkok. You'll get pregnant straightaway. Guaranteed, really! See. That's what happens if you have kids. You're gossiping, chatting, but... But how about you? How are you doing over there? That's why you should come to Bangkok so you can know everything. Look at her. On the phone, taking care of kids. Look at her face... She's always like that. Look at me! I'm beaming! Really, Yani hasn't changed. Ta, I need to go to the toilet again. - Again? - Just a minute. Didn't you just go? Gosh, you really can't hold it in, huh? I'll just wait here. Here? - I'll take these. - Just these? - Well? - Ta... I think you should be the one to go to Bangkok. Why? I'm pregnant again! Are you serious? Congratulations. - Let's go. - Yes. Have you called that Rahmat? Yes, but he often doesn't pick up. What? Can I give you a piece of advice? If I may. I think you should be careful. He's married. Your career is in a good place right now. Not everyone can be like you, and you have a reputation to keep. Okay? So, I'm not willing to let everything get messy... ... because of an affair with a married man. I just want to feel happy again with someone. Yes. I know that. But not by hurting another woman too, right? Anyway, what's my schedule for the coming weeks? I think you're going to Brazil in two weeks. And you also have a rehearsal schedule. Don't be late. - I'm never late, Kus. - Yeah, I know that. Okay, I should go. Okay. Shin. Focus. Okay. Alright then. I'll hire an interior designer for your place. No need. I can go shopping alone. Hello? Miss Shinta? I'd just like to remind you. You left your membership card. Yes, you can get it anytime. Yes, Miss, thank you. - Hold on, honey. - Yes. Let's go, sir. Hopefully it works this time, Doctor. Yes, hopefully. Because honestly,... ... I know what she's like. If it fails this time,... ... she'll be so stressed out. Well, hopefully. Sorry. What is it, Doctor? Why don't I have a record about your fertility test? - You need it? - Of course. I have to know whether or not your sperm cells are fertile. It's standard procedure before doing IVF. If you're not fertile, it's like shooting blanks. I mean, it doesn't have to be right now... I think you can do it now. Doctor, I'll just come back myself. - Why? - That's... I'm just looking out for my wife's feelings. Next time. I want something better. - Now. - Later. I better thank you. Crying? This happens after the injection. It hurts, and it's not comfortable. Come here... I feel like I want to get mad. Come here. - Move your arm. - Yes, alright. In two weeks, my hormones will be enough for ovulating, right? - Keep your spirits up. - Yes. Just as you are, you already complete me. - This has to be ready tomorrow. - Alright. - Thank you. - Yes. You're welcome. - Di, is Zuki here? - In his office, sir. - Are you busy? - That depends. - Can I ask for a favor? - Unless you want to borrow money. I have a patient right now, but I need to go to the clinic. - Can you handle it? - Now? - Okay, okay. - Thank you. - Nurse. - Yes. I was asked by Doctor Peni to go to... ... the masturbation room. Where is it? Of course. Ahmad! Yes? I'll take care of you. Come on. Just relax. Don't be afraid. Don't be tense. Wait, you should be tense! Remember that! Come in. Just relax. I'm only checking on you. - Why so long? Surprised? - Yes. - Do you need help? - No! Would you like us to get your wife? Usually couples prefer to... I deliberately didn't bring my wife. She'll just get more upset. Oh, I see. Relax, sir. I've handled other people's semen for 10 years. Well, of course with a capsule. Many men are stressed about their sperm cell test. They feel like their masculinity is being tested. I don't have a problem with my masculinity being tested. I'm just worried if the results aren't up to expectations. Whose expectations? My wife's expectations. Don't be too stressed, sir. You'll just produce too little. (Cashier) (Embryology) Now you just report downstairs. I'll test this in the lab. - Thanks. - Yes. Hey, good luck. If you're not fertile, the barbell flies. - Thanks. - Yes. Shinta? Hi, how are you? - I'm good. - Hold on. Miss, earlier I... Oh so that's the story. Yes. Rather than staying married but being pressured by his parents,... ... I just decided to divorce. Yes, yes. - Rahmat? - Yes. If it turns out your wife is... Barren. What would you do? I'm okay with it. Meaning... Maybe it's easier said than done, but for me,... ... being married is not solely just to have children... ... and always spending time with the children. But it's also spending time together. So I personally don't have a problem with it. Again, that's my opinion. If I knew, I wouldn't have broken up with you. I should go. I still have work to do. Okay, bye. Rahmat... If I call you, please pick up. Yes. Get in! I want to ask you something. What do you think about infertile men? They're nothing. That's like a striker that can't score a goal. So if I'm infertile, I'm not a man? Are you going to take your turn? Let's just do this! This is a billiards table, not infertile table. Come on! - Do you want a drink? - Iced tea. - Sir, one iced tea. - Okay. Your turn. You're not concentrating. You're thinking too much. One ball at a time! It's in! That's not infertile. You know where the hole is and how to use it. Husbands are afraid of different things. There are husbands who are afraid of their wives. There are husbands who are afraid they can't provide for their family. Or husbands who are afraid they can't educate their children well. What are you afraid of? Honey... Honey, can you help me inject? - What are you doing? - Getting work clothes for tomorrow. On my butt. Not on the thigh? My thighs have hurt since yesterday. Honey, something funny happened in the office today. You know Dian. She's really... I dont know why. After these injections,... ... I'm always a little sensitive, I just want to get mad. So today I had a lot of work to do. I asked her for help with my work. But she got mad at me too! She didn't know I was like this right now. I don't know, honey. Maybe pregnant people are... Maybe I’m already pregnant? I always feel like... Ow! And then... Honey, so we ended up not talking to each other. She was probably sulking at me. Then we saw each other again in the cafeteria. She came to my table all of a sudden. Do you know why? She didn't bring any money! So just so casually, without any pride,... ... she asked to borrow some money. That Dian... She's so funny. Honey? What's wrong? Problems at the office. Yes? Keep your spirits up! Spirits up! - Let's go to the bed. - Okay. I'm going to sleep. Honey. I love you. I love you too. Go to sleep. You'll be tired tomorrow. I wanted to explain to you, but I didn't have time. - So? - I was about to tell you. When were you going to tell me? - Honey, listen to me... - You weren't honest with me. You don't know how much this hurts me! No! Go! Go away! Don't come back here! Thank you. Wow, your schedule is really full. I worked on it until my eyes were watery. - Here. - Thank you. - What do I have next week? - Next week? Let me have a look. You have a fashion spread. And... - A commercial... - Hello? What else? Oh, there's a meeting. Cancel everything I have. What? Shin! That's crazy. Rahmat. Hey. It turns out we're the same. Rahmat... I just remembered I never apologized to you. What for? Because I left you. It's okay. You left me. He left you. You can't give him a child. I also can't. So how are you now? How are you yourself going through this? I can't go through it yet. Cheers. For barren people. I don't think I'm worthy of being your husband. I can't give you children. Give me time. To accept all this. What the hell... I know it's hard for you. So are you separating? I don't know. Maybe I... I'll try to go through it with my husband first. Where is he? He's not picking up. Honey? - Hey, Zuk. - Ta, this is a surprise. - Where's my husband? - Well... I don't really know. I'm also having trouble calling him. The boss doesn't know where he is. He canceled all his patients. Really? Well... Now I'm confused. Where should I look for him? Maybe Hot Rod. You know he sometimes likes to go there? Yes, okay. I better go. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - How was Brazil? - So fun. - I brought a souvenir for you. - Thank you. Nice! Very cool! You had time to think of this? You like soccer. - Wow, this is really cool. - Try it. - It's a good color, huh? - Yeah, really good. Honey? Honey, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - I'm getting out of here. You want to leave me because I'm sterile? You're the one who left me first. Where are you when I'm having a hard time to accept this about you? I ask you, where are you? You went out with her, right? Out of all the women... You should think of my feelings, I have to compete with her! Hey, listen to me! I'm not having an affair! If you want to talk about feelings, then what about my feelings? I'm the barren one out of the two of us! I can't and I will never be able to fulfil all your dreams! You don't understand that. She does because she's just like me! I didn't do anything, I swear! You love me because you want to build a family. I will still build a family. But not with you. Honey... Honey, what do you want? What do you want? It's over. (Second Hand Goods) (For Sale) (Baby Shoes. Never worn.) Hey, the patients are asking for you. When can you start working again? I'm taking care of your patients for now. Including the Sutoyos. Take your time. I'm helping out at this end. Hey, does Shinta have a number? Mat? Hey! Fine. Metal greetings, huh? Out! I actually don't like losing you. I... I just want to have distance. When do you start working in Bangkok? Immediately, sir. But are you aware... ... office regulations state that you should have given this... ... 90 days ago? I can make this hard for you. But I heard your story. Be safe. Take care of yourself. Keep in touch. Okay? Give this to HR. Thanks, sir. Don't wear too much makeup in Bangkok. People will think you're a ladyboy. Thank you, sir. Hi, Kus. Cancel everything I have for next week. No, I'm not crazy. Yes, Kus. I won't fuck this up. Please do this for me. I just need a week off. If they reject me, that's fine. There are more important things for me here. Okay. Bye. Kiss-kiss. - Morning. - Morning. Your door was unlocked, so I just came in. Ow... Be careful, there are burglars around. You haven't changed. You're dirty. You can cook now? I travel a lot, so I just learn. Delicious. What are you doing here? I've been in your position before. That's how I know you'd be like this. Like this how? You want someone next to you. You want someone in the same boat. There's no need. It's embarrassing. - It's embarrassing. - I've seen your underwear before. Really, it's embarrassing. Just leave it. Please. Just leave it. Okay? Fine, I won't do laundry. But there are things you have to do. - Yes, whatever. - Really? You learned to shave from modeling too? I used to shave Heru. When we were still together. How are you with Tata? I'm sorry. But I think... ... she's the one who doesn't deserve you. Then who does? Thank you. I'm really proud of you. You can have all this on your own. That's great. I'm the one who should thank you. Why? You're the one who always used to take me to photoshoots. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have all this. It feels more homey, right? - More livable. - Livable. You're welcome to stay. - What? - You're welcome to stay. You should be proud to have a man like me. You constantly praise yourself. You never praise me. That's what makes me upset every day. Okay now, it's like this. Do you realize we're not in love anymore? Hey, what are you saying? Now I ask you. Do you have any thoughts in your heart to still love me? - No way. - No? - It's over! - Yes, it's over! - This is useless! - Yes, useless! That's enough! You two... You are the saddest couple in the world. Do you know that? You're both still healthy. At your age, one of you is usually dead. The other is usually crying, without having an income. You also have children. Sir, you've known her for 30 years, but don't know her favorite veggie. And Ma'am. You think too much. You don't remember when you first fell in love with your husband. Try to remember. Think about it. Why did you get married? Why? There's only one answer. Both of you would like to spend the rest of your life together... ... to be happy together. Why do you love each other? Because what you are... ... already complete each other to live this life together. That's what I said to my wife at our marriage ceremony. Back then. Geez! You don't need me. You need each other. What happened? Let's go to Ancol. And from Ancol, straight to Bali? Hi. I called your office. Zuki said you might be here. - Why are you looking for me? - How are you, Mat? You're not going to go after her? She wants to build a family. And that's what I can't give her. Okay, Mat... I'm going to tell you something... ... that Tata doesn't want you to know. But I really love the both of you. - So... - Tell me what? Tata accepted a job offer. She's moving to Bangkok. She leaves tomorrow morning. At 10 o'clock. Sir... Would you like anything? I'm full. (Living World) - I'd like a gado-gado. - Gado-gado. - Without bean sprouts. - Something to drink? - An iced lemon tea. - Okay. I really don't like bean sprouts. It feels like eating grass. - You've had grass? - It's really bad. - Do you like it? - Yes. This is actually tiring. Do you need to buy something else after this? - No. Let's just go home. - No? Okay, we'll go home. How about this? - I'll put this here. - Just on the table. - Yes. - Okay. Thanks for everything. I'm sorry. I need you. Not you. Tata. She can't understand you. I can. I'd like to be able to love you. I know only you can understand me. But I still take this wherever I go. I'll never be able to have a relationship with anyone,... ... including you,... ... because I really love Tata. - Even though she left you? - Yes. If you're not with me, then who will you be with? And who will I be with? Mat! Your seven and eight o'clock have confirmed, right? Cancel all my patients. What should I tell them? Tell them I can't save their marriages. - Why? - Because I have to save mine. Hey! Watch it! (BlackBerry) (Visitors & Companions) (BlackBerry) (Delete?) (Flight Information) (Departures) What are you doing here? I don't want us to divorce. Can you give me a reason why we shouldn't divorce? I love you, and I know you also love me. Yeah, but that's the reason we got married. Now I ask you,... ... can you give me a reason... ... why we shouldn't divorce? I have to board. (Zones 1-6) (Departures) You didn't go to Bangkok? You really love me, honey? Yes. That was why we got married. Love isn't enough? I met your patient. Strange people. - Honey! - What? That's his wife! Our doctor's wife! Okay... Excuse me, I'd like to ask you something. - Yes? - Are you... Are you Dr. Rahmat's wife? - Rahmat what? I don't remember. - It ends in "ningrat". Well, if you want to call it husband... See! I'm never wrong, honey! Thank you, Miss. - Thank you. - For what? He got mad at us yesterday. He hit his desk. I was so scared! He told us about... About his wife. When he married and they were still in college. - Not that! - Yes, that! He said he remembered what he said at the ceremony. Yes, yes... Something about completing each other. Just like the two of us, right? Is that right, Miss? - See, honey? That's right! - Yes, yes. We should remember how much we love each other. Just as you are, you already complete me. Just as you are, you also already complete me. I also don't know how I could have asked you that. Any reason why we should reconcile? There is no reason for us to reconcile. Because the truth is there's no reason for us to separate. You remember, honey? We complete each other. Honey? But you have nothing to do with that Shinta, right? Oh no! I forgot! I should have picked her up half an hour ago! Oh no! Honey! You... Honey! I was kidding! - I have to go! Quickly! - You're lying! Here! Come on! Pick me up! Excuse me? Shin? Come in, Kus. I'll be ready soon. Why are you in a rush? I canceled your flight to Tokyo. - Why? - Management decision. Whatever. I'm still going. I think I should leave the two of you alone. (Al-Amin Orphanage) - Yes. - Come on, Ma'am! Hello, I'm Tata. This is my husband. - Rahmat. - Have a seat? - Yes. - Yes.
