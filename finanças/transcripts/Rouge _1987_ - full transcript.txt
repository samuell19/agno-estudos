Adds further to my sorrow. Splendid! Pity me pinning after you in melancholy. Facing the moon in sorrow. So many sentimental people. Master 12 is not himself. Young master. Chen-pang, why so late? How many deer organs have you sold? You must be joking. Master 12, why so late? Chen-pang, there's a virgin courtesan at Yi Hung. She spent a night with a Fu Shan sucker and become a prostitute. She's ideal for you. l've already sent for her in your name. Who was that singsong girl? ''So many sentimental people''. Hear that? Master, let's go. Where are you going? Soleil and Scarlet are here. Master. Master, sorry, we're late. Small thing. Our two friends are both lonely. That's serious. Scarlet, be Master Lei's companion. Soleil, be Master Chen's companion. Master Ho Hsi, our girls have said 'yes'. Master 12, l'm Soleil. She lost her virginity a month ago. How fragrant. She knows you like Eau de Cologne. Thank you, Master 12. So Yun Piao-piao does care for me. Thanks for your tips, Master. He really is generous. Of course, he's known for his generosity. Masters. Let me drink to you all before leaving. Well, let's drink. Fleur. Fleur, a guest. Who's it? Master Chen 12. Which one? That one who was at Kam Ling Restaurant last night. l don't know him. Madam, turn him down for me. Yes. Let me see what kind of a role it is. Yun Piao-piao's being publicized again. When will be your turn? Moon, lend me some rouge. Help yourself. Now you've lost! l've lost several times. Pay up, no more nonsense. Which card, if not this? Come on, shuffle, quick! Fleur. Remember me? l can't see clearly at a close range. Last night. Facing the moon in sorrow. l was only taking a moral holiday. Do you mind? No. l don't even knit my brows. Had l got so close to you would you have avoided me? lfyou did, you're not the girl l want. Master Chen 12, do you rank 12 or 2? Second. What do you do? Grocery. You're a big boss. You've been with me for quite a while. l'll come back after l finish playing mahjong. Where's your ''Garoupa''? He's waiting alone. No one but me is waiting alone. Chiu hasn't been here for a month. There must be some problems Get Secretary Chen to write a letter. How? Just say you've bought cough syrup for him and ask him to take care of himself. That will do. My mammy always wants me to peel oranges and feeds her. Do you have to feed your elder sisters? l have no elder sisters and no wife. What about your younger sisters? l have no younger sisters and no wife. Sorry, l don't like oranges. Want to smoke opium? No, l want to be sober with you. Have you made up? What's there to see? Excuse me. My sisters want me for another 4 rounds. Why keep the door open? l enjoy seeing you pacing up and down. Why so many corridors here? Are you following me? No, l'm waiting alone. What? Your girls always keep the guests waiting till they flare up without any pent-up. They are dubbed ''Fired Garoupa''. This way? The cool wind has faith. Fleur. Fleur. Master 12 again. Fleur, come here at once. Look, Master 12 is sitting up above. Look upward. Put it here. Fleur, look, Master 12. This pair of scrolls is from Master 12. Beautiful. Take a look at the inscriptions. Really interesting. ''Alluring as mighty Diana.'' ''Apathetic like a flower.'' Be careful! l saw this imported bed. lt costs $200. Too expensive! Be careful. Where's Fleur? Where's Fleur? Must be seeking divination at Wen Wu Temple. Mind the pillar. The young boss ofthat grocery shop? Why don't you disassemble it first? Master Chen 12 wants it transported in original packing. A prostitute's every man's wife. This bed can admit many men. Don't say that. Fleur, your guest is full of gimmicks. Right. Fleur. Open the door. The bed's coming soon. Fleur, come up at once. Come up. l've been a procuress for over 20 years. l've never seen a more considerate guest. Sure knows how to woo ladies. You really have a way with girls. You have many different looks. What are they? Heavy, light makeup, male makeup, no makeup. Also, like a mighty Diana or a flower. Which type do you prefer? l like them all. l like them either separated or together. Which is the real one? My answer may scare you. The real thing is the most ugly. l want to see it because l love you. l want to see a special look. Which one? l'll tell you later. You're evil. l know. Not yet off duty? Coming soon. Several dropouts from the Miss HK Beauty Pageant are blowing the lid offthe scandals. You'd better take care of yourselftonight. Chu. l bought something for you. Give it to me tomorrow. lt's cumbersome. lt's in my drawer. Why didn't you ask me about my favorite color? Your shoes are worn out. Keep away. Your feet stink? Did you ever smell them? Thank you. Excuse me. Go home early. Sir. What can l do for you? l want to put up an ad. for a missing person. Wait. How would you want it to be worded? Master 12, 3811, waiting at the Same Place - Fleur. Master 12? 3811, waiting at the Same Place - Fleur. Like this? $15 per column for classified, $110 per sq. in for others. Minimum 3 sq. in, that's $330 per day. How big is 3 sq. in? Like this. So small? Any bigger size? lt's a matter of luck. Don't spend so much for a big size. He'll read it for sure. Put down your name, address, tel. number & lD number. Pay in advance. ln advance? Yes. Sorry, l didn't bring enough money. l'll come again, OK? lt's closing time now. Come early tomorrow. Anyway it's already full for tomorrow. The ad will appear 2 days after registration. 2 days? No way. Have you waited long? lt's now 19... Are you alright? What's the date today? March 6. Day after tomorrow is March 8? l'll come again tomorrow. What's your surname, sir? Y-U-A-N. Thank you, Mr. Yuan. What a coincidence, Mr. Yuan. Did l scare you? Yes. Sorry. l didn't know you were behind me. My feet are light. What happened? l lost my way. Where are you going? Shek Tong Tsui. How can l get there? lt's far away. Get there by car. You can get a taxi here. Over there you can take a mini-bus. l live in Shek Tong Tsui. Really? Formerly l lived there too. Hong Kong's changed now. You come from the mainland? The way you look shows it. Where do you come from? l come from down below. You come from below? lt must be hard then. lt's alright. You can take a taxi here. Excuse me. Aren't you returning to Shek Tong Tsui? l want to have a mid-night snack. You're not going to Shek Tong Tsui? No. Why? l want to follow you. Let's sit down to a chat. Why are you following me? l'm not the type of girl you've in mind. What girl? A maniac. Fleur, l don't know you. l don't know or care who you are. You came here to put up an ad for someone. And to pick me up. No, to follow me. You're like a hound. What on earth do you want? Why are you following me? l'll go home in a minute. How much to have one's fortune read? You want to have your fortune read? Character analysis. $20-$30 will do. Have you got enough money? No. Formerly someone offered 1 hunchback & 2 parcels for touching my hand. What? $500. 1 hunchback for 5 and 2 parcels for '00'. Never heard of it. Did you let him do it? He also offered two $500 notes for touching my ear. Well, l'm fed up with it. This should be enough for carfare. l'll repay you. Hold it. Any business? Sit down. How much for character analysis? $20 for one character. Draw one character. What do you want to predict? A missing person. ''An'' Let me look it up for you. ''An'' means good luck. Really? Yes, ''An'' means you'll get news. You'll find him very soon. ls he still alive? Yes, one sun here and another there. lt means sunshine. He must be on earth. ln Hong Kong? Yes. Mr. Yuan, is this tram for Shek Tong Tsui? Yes. What's your relationship with Master 12? My close friend. What do you mean? They call it darling nowadays. His name's Chen-pang, last name Chen. The young boss of 3 medicine shops. When was that? He belonged to a family of 12? No, in fact he ranks 2. His elder brother died early. lt was the vogue to have a big family. So they made him rank 12. Your last name? What's your rank? l only have one sister. Females have no family rank. You may be called Yuan 11 or Master Yuan. Sounds like an obsolete Cantonese movie. Yes. Where's Tai Ping Theatre? l used to see Chinese opera there. Have we passed it? Pulled down already. lt's now a commercial arcade. l saw Chen Po-chu's films at Tai Ping Theatre. Who is Chen Po-chu? You don't know her? Ever seen her show? No, l watch Chinese opera only. Kam Yip Kuk, Chen Sai-mei, etc. We used to take the stall seats. $3 for one ticket. A row of concubine chairs. We were the fans of No. 5. We had a sister called Violet. Theyjeered at her for being his fan. No. 5? Who's No. 5? When was that? l died at 23. You say it's now 1987? Already over 50 years then. What are you talking about? Are you out ofyour mind? Who are you? You're not human. You're a ghost. Why keep following me? You said we'd meet again iffate willed it. l wanted to meet a human being, not a ghost. l bear you no grudge. l saw you right away from below. Where? Hell. l committed suicide with Master 12 and promised to meet again in hell. But l arrived first and failed to meet him. So l've come up to look for him. Will you do me a favor to find him? Why do you pick me to help you? l was a whore since 16. My first night was very expensive. Then l became a famous courtesan at Yi Hung. There were 3 other famous brothels. We were called the Four Aces. l failed the School Cert. Exam in History. March 8 is our death anniversary. l'll find him for sure this time. Will you admit me for 2 days till l meet master 12? l'll repay your favor in a next life. How can l admit you? Come home with me? You live in Shek Tong Tsui too? As a ghost, you can live anywhere. For stray ghosts maybe. l'm fed up after over 50 years. An ad costs $330. Can you afford that? You still owe me $50. Formerly people paid to touch my neck. l don't want to touch it. Here we are? Please go. l beg you. Why are you crying? This is Shek Tong Tsui, isn't it? All changed. lt was the old-established Kam Ling Restaurant here. Kam Ling. Over here were Yi Hung. Why are you laughing? Look, Yi Hung Brothel is now a kindergarten. We promised to meet here. Wonder if he could find his way here. Why do you agree to admit me? You're not horrible and you're pitiable. You're soft-hearted? So was Master 12. Ting, l'm Chu. Chu, where are you? The trouble is l have to get data. l can't come back early. They defamed each other. Where are you? What's it? Happy? Leave me to sink or swim. You knew what has happened ifyou are with me. Something wrong with me tonight. What? l brought a female home. What? l brought a female back. What's wrong? You're romantic tonight. Buy me the shoes and come up with lots of ideas. Yes, l'm nervous. l wish l could rush home to find out the truth. You'll understand then. l can't make it clear now. Just wait. Never mind the copies? Bye-bye. You haven't eaten for over 50 years. Hungry? Why didn't you tell her you brought a ghost home? She won't believe it. Did she believe you brought a female home? Anyway, she'd talk back whatever l tell her. Coke, foreign Wong Lao Kut. How long have you known each other? Four years. Why don't you marry her? Maybe there's no pressure. How long have you known Master 12? Six months. Why didn't he marry you? Why did you commit suicide? Because his family objected. l'm not hungry but l feel like eating. Chu. Chu. She's not human. No, she's a vixen. You had the nerve to bring a girl in. Stop acting now. She really is a ghost. She spit out the apple l fed her. And some blackjuice. A ghost can smell, but not eat. Chu. He said you're a ghost. l'm Fleur. Please put down your head and comb it. l can't. Why play a ghost then? Can you go through this wall? Or hold your tongue out to rinse? Can you suck blood? Chinese ghosts don't suck blood, do they? Chinese ghosts bask in macho spirit. Don't you? No. You are the dumbest ghost. The way you look is nostalgic, or ghost-like, to put it more plainly. When did you die? 1934. That was more than 50 years ago. The quality ofthis shroud is not bad. No change in 50 years. lt has remained intact for 50 years. Dare you go to bedroom with me? What are you doing? A post-mortem. Strip. Have you got bras ofthe 30's? She really has no heartbeat. Why are you bringing in a ghost? Miss Chu, just call me Fleur. A sad life in a lonely boat. Look at the pair of swallows against the setting sun. l'll go and see your mother tomorrow. l'll tell her we're a good pair. lmpossible, you have a nice mouth. My mouth is a bit twisted. That'll make us a good combination. Ever heard of a fat husband for a thin wife or an ugly wife for a handsome husband? Your bad mouth for my good mouth. Come, let's make a comparison. Don't. What did your mother say? She told me to help her wear earrings. Madam, Fleur is here. Auntie. Erh, get some tea. Yes. Master Wen, please wait. Please come in. Sit down. Fleur, you're a wonderful girl. Last night Chen-pang told me you wanted to see me alone. lt's my first time. l know this is typical ofyou courtesans. Auntie, please excuse my rudeness. Don't be formal. l like girls who are brave. Have tea. Erh, get some refreshments. Have some tea. lt's nice. Have you ever drunk this? Hangchow girls pick tender tea leaves before Ching Ming and bring them home nurtured with sweat inside their breast. lt's called Breast Lung Ching. Ever heard ofthis? The highest quality comes from virgins only. So neither you nor l can pick it. Nor can they. Auntie, Chen-pang and l love each other. A girl of my background can't expect much. l only want to become an honest woman. Since you're so frank, let me be frank too. We Chens have kept ourselves quite alone. He has a cousin Shu-hsien. l wish they could get married soon. Could start his own business. Our ancestors now all depend on him. We'll see ifyou should join us. l know a girl of your personality won't change. Chen-pang is only 24. l only worry he may change. You know men well. l'm sure he won't change either. So much the better. l'm happy for you. Master Wen. What? Auntie. Wait a minute. Her fabric on you is not beautiful. Fleur, want to try it on? l've found a house in Pa Fa Street. We're moving in tomorrow. Can't l just touch the ear? No. How about smelling that gown collar? Two for the calves. One for the toes. Not enough. Your money to be spent on young lovers? l don't know. They say others can't sleep on this bed except Master 12. l have slept on it. l haven't. How much do you want? We can sleep on the floor. Creased. Creased new dresses are more comfortable. How about old ones? Thrown away. How about men? The same. Don't worry, you have many different looks. l can't fling all ofyou away. Uncle Hua, keep this for ginseng. Why should a decent family man learn acting? l've had an aptitude for acting since childhood. Chen-pang rehearses his voice regularly. But a good foundation is essential for acting. By following Uncle Hua, he may rise above the herd some day. Life is drama and drama is life. Acting reflects the different facets of life. But after acting, you can't help. For instance, a pupil must do household chores for his master before learning. They're too many to enumerate. You may not stand such an ordeal. Like a piece ofjade, he needs tempering. Let me hear your vocal cords. Sing a song. Can you sing ''Come Home''? Stop. Why don't you come home? Cuckoos sing, sobbing under the peach-blossom. Too sad, too sad. Cuckoos sing, lamenting the miserable world. Good. Good. The master is humiliated by a girl at the border. Who's Master 12? Can't you identify him? There he is. His makeup beguiles me. lt's an ordeal. You've to undergo years of ordeal. Everybody. Yes. Come with me. ls the intruder demon Fan Li-hua? Precisely. Be smart to dismount and surrender. You must be Hsueh Ting-shan. l meet you here for a predestined match. l bear you no grudge. Watch out. Come here for a rest. Sit down. Next time use our own. Theirs is bad for skin. Chen Chen-pang, visitors. Father, mother. Shu-hsien. Uncle, Auntie. Auntie wants me to come with him. Chen-pang, come back with me. Come back at once. Forget your relationship with her. Wait till he finishes this act. Stay out of our family affairs. Chen-pang, you're on. Come out quickly. Come out. Hurry up. Come out. Fleur, l know you're understanding. Leave him now. He'll come back for sure. l understand my son well. lfyou don't leave him, he'll eventually come back to me. Master, keep clam. A son's a son. You can't tie him up with a rope. Buy at that stall at the theatre entrance. lt looks fine, but the rouge has to be changed. A beauty with a silk tie. lt's auspicious to find a good husband. Your dream boded well for the arrival of a son. l got this when we first met. l had my personal fortune read. The interpreter said it meant an ideal match. lt's a divination of high quality. A mutual wish can be fulfilled. Start from the very beginning. Don't seek to embrace a slender waist early. Dance to the air offlute. This is also a divination of high quality. The interpreter said wedding could be expected but we had to be patient. The road is fraught with obstacles. Don't get lost in bewilderment. A dignitary will guide the course. lt's rejoicing to get out ofthe trouble. This is a divination of medium quality. Since l became a courtesan. l sought divination twice a month. Up to now there have been over 200 slips. Most ofthem portended well. Now l have got you. So my life has been worthwhile. Day Two, March 8, 1934, 11 p.m. We committed suicide in Yi Hung Brothel. They say we have to close next year. Why did you commit suicide? We wanted to be with each other forever. l haven't got money for the advertisement yet. Don't worry. We will pay for it. The advertisement will appear tomorrow. Tomorrow at 11 p.m. you'll see him. 3811, Same Place, right? lt's dawn. Are you afraid? l don't know. Mr. Yuan, Miss Chu, thank you. lt's nice to be close to ''Yi Hung''. He watches her going to the brothel everyday. She should take him away, human or ghost. The earliest up to 1938 only. Where can l get that for 1934? The shop was Shing Fung and the boss was Chen Shing Fung. His son is Chen Chen-pang. People called him Master 12. Shing Fung? lt was years ago. You know him? No, but l still remember the shop. We were still young then. About 8 or 10, l think. lt's said raw opium killed his son. Heavens! And l couldn't get a sniff. Maybe my father knows it. Ask him for me. He's dead. Buddy, give me a newspaper. Yes. Just published with the latest news. Thank you. Look. The ad appears in all major papers in HK. Master 12 must find his way here. Fleur. What are you doing? The macho fire is strong. You were alright last night. l've been here for 3 days. You can go back after seeing Master 12. Life me up. Use this cosmetics, it won't fade. This way? Apply it hard several times. Would he become a '' Fried Garoupa''? No. What would you do if Master 12 should get reincarnated into a rat or a ''Garoupa''? lmpossible. Wish there would be no cat or dog now. What time is it now? Five minutes to eleven. Would he be late? He's always punctual. Bad, he's changed into a female. How funny she's dressed. Yes. What time is it now? Half past eleven. He seldom comes late. She's very weird. ''Throwing'' eyes at you? No, at you. No. Weird, but terribly pretty. She's your type. Go ahead. She's your type. What time is it? 10 minutes to twelve. Fleur. Obviously not 11 o'clock 8th March. Could 3811 be his lD card number? An lD card number has 6 numerals. Maybe the middle four numerals. Simple, l'll check the registers. No, that would only complicate matters. Besides a Birth Certificate or an lD card, it could be the number of his Bank A/C. Also a tax bill, a car licence, a credit card. Even a TV set or a fridge. Even that pair of sports shoes has a number. One is weighed down by so many numbers. There's yet another possibility. He could live at No. 3, Block 11, 8th floor either in Princess Margaret Rd. or Des Voeux Rd. lt could be a telephone number too. And the number of a bleeper. A bleeper? That's easy. There are not too many paging stations in HK. Mr. Yuan, l'm 3811. $1,000, $2,000 for 1 night. Leave word there. Please call 3811. Leave your name and telephone number. Call 3811, my last name is Yuan. What now? A bleeper call doesn't work. She's sobbing. Let her have her way. Fleur, l know the chance is slim. We'll find him. Plenty oftime. We yearn to see Master 12 too. She envies me. Of course she does, my being so nice to you. Your being so nice to me? No? She said a lucky woman had a good husband. An unlucky one became a whore. One man all lifetime isn't enough. lf l had known Master 12. l would have loved him. Would you like Fleur? Speak up. Don't keep quiet. She's terrific, l can't stand her. l want only you. Would you commit suicide for me? Would we be that romantic? Just answer me. No. What about you? No. Want to buy antiques? l passed here when going to or from work but l've never thought of buying anything for you. See ifthey've got a rouge box. A rouge box? How vulgar? Would we be Master 12 and Fleur? Boss, how much is this rouge box? Rouge box? Sorry, only an lndian scent bag. 1934, the year Fleur died. Boss, what's ''Bone''? The former newspaper for pen pals. lt was a gossip paper about courtesans. lt's now 50-year old. Formerly it was 1 cent each. Now it's valuable. Famous courtesan Fleur of Yi Hung commits suicide for love. What do these mean? Master 12 is still alive. He's still alive. You said he committed suicide with you. Why did the papers report a check up. He's swallowed opium plus sleeping pills. He said himself he'd taken opium. But not sleeping pills. Why? Who gave him the pills? l did. l yearned to die myself. l was afraid he might not die of opium leaving me behind in hell. l wouldn't let him live with Shu-hsien. Would you help Shu-hsien wear earrings? Yes. l would even pick her ears. And thinking ofyou, while doing it. Would you help Shu-hsien wear a gown? Yes. l'd even help her button. But thinking ofyou, while doing it. l can't bear seeing you suffer at the Theatrical Troupe. You won't see it any more. Are you regretting now? So much the better for us. We can be with each other forever. The wine had sleeping pills. l put them in advance. How many? 40. Did he drink it alone? He drank 3 glasses, l, one. One more. Chen-pang. Today's March 8, it's now 11, 3811. Chen-pang, remember this number? lfwe should change or forget in a next life the number will remind you of me and me ofyou. Don't be afraid. Let's go together. Why didn't you tell him it had sleeping pills? l was afraid. Why did you make him drink? He was afraid. But he can't get away anyway. Why is he still alive? lf he was true, he could die one more time. But he preferred to live and leave me behind. Why? Why is he still alive? Fiddlesticks, who's willing to die? He sacrificed everything for you but you suspected him and poisoned him. He'll die, eating or not eating. lt was murder. Why should he die for you again? You are really devious. He won't see you again now. You're a murderer. l must find him. He won't see you, nor will l. Go now. Chu, don't. Leave me alone. Don't. Leave me alone. Fleur. Fleur. You want to ruin her? You think she's a good sort? Sorry. She's not coming. Who? Both Fleur and Master 12 are not coming. What are you waiting for? You. You may be saying ''keep out''. But you have a soft spot. You'll finally have to help. l'm very positive about it. l shouldn't have forced Fleur away. There won't be another Fleur at this age. Fate is unkind for women. l envy her. l admire her. l daren't do what she did. Never given a thought to it. Yes, we're laymen only. Just count the good, happy days. Not more romantic ideas of death. Life is precious. Fleur didn't come up. lf she died, was l the indirect cause of it? Fate has kept us apart. We sob after parting at the terrace. Like drizzles, tears keep falling till dawn. Shan-pai's alone in a desolate room. Love-sick, l'm in infinite sorrow. Ying-tai! You've not answered my echo. Fleur. Fleur. You forgot your purse? Are you going to wait for Master 12? He's up above. Three years' company ended in a romance. ls he Master 12? Miss Chu, angry with me? lf l were you, l'd have done the same to a coward like him. Where have you been? We were worried. Try my best to find him. The macho fire's strong. l'm tired. Never thought it ended like that. Providence, l call it. But l am really not mollified. Am l looking ugly? You're going back, aren't you? l'll forget everything after taking this. Content myselfwith reincarnation. Let me answer the call. Sorry, Miss Ling. l've just returned from overseas. Why did you want to see me? Are you Chen Chen-pang or Master Chen 12? Why do you want to see him? l'm a reporter of an entertainment paper. We have a new column on interview of ex-actors. We write about their past. l'd like to interview him. What's your relationship with him? Nil. He was an ex-actor? He was only a petty actor. Where's he now? Go to the studio. He often hangs around there. He is waiting to play the lead role. Playing a minor role in the studio? That's too good for him then. Mammy told me he spent my grandpa's fortune before l was born. ls your mammy named Cheng Shu-hsien? How do you know? She died long ago. Good. OK, Director? OK. Pal, more wind, more smoke. Hung, let's do it again. Your role's a swordsman and a ghost. Fly like a swordsman does and act horribly like a ghost. lt's hard. Just do it. A swordsman and a ghost? How? Mr. Chen Chen-pang. Mr. Chen Chen-pang. Where is Mr. Chen Chen-pang? l don't know. Are you Mr. Chen Chen-pang? No. You know where Mr. Chen Chen-pang is? This hand is a sure loss. Do you know Mr. Chen Chen-pang? No. Master Chen 12. No. Master Chen 12? You know him? He boasted he had 3 shops. l had 5 shops. Where's he? As extras, we just squat anywhere. ls that he? Formerly a VlP, now small fry. Are you sure it's him? Mr. Yuan, Miss Chu. Thank you for finding him for me. Really him? l'll never forget your favor. Do you want to take him away? See you next life. Fleur. The setting sun shines at the swallows. Thanks for remembering me. l've kept this rouge box for 53 years. Take it. l won't wait any more. Promises vanish like smoke. Love, burning love, can hardly last forever. Fleur...forgive me. lnto the ocean goes my bucket ofwater called love. Why are you leaving me behind here? With the two of us in this imperfect world. Age may alter our visage but never our love. l pray for a day of reunion. When you would desert me no more. When you would be arrested by love. Tell me when will be that day.
