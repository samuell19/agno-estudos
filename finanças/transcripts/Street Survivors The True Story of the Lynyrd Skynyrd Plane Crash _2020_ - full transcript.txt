Three members of the country rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd were among six people killed when a twin-engine plane crashed in a southeastern Mississippi swamp. The plane was carrying 25 persons including the seven members of the band, their backing singers, and road crew. The dead were lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines and Gaines' sister, vocalist Cassie Gaines. Investigators said the plane ran out of gas and crashed 200 yards short of where the pilot had hoped to set it down. The chartered Convair 240 was apparently running low on fuel and clipped the tops off tall pine trees for about 100 yards before ploughing nose-first into a hardwood thicket. Some of the 20 survivors said several members of the group had argued against taking the plane. They were going to vote on whether to continue flying in it after a concert tonight. Authorities say it appears the pilot was trying to crash-land the plane after running low on fuel, but struck treetops near McComb, Mississippi, on the Louisiana border. The leader of the group, Van Zant, helped create country rock hits like Free Bird and Sweet Home... There have been many variations and accounts and contradictions of this story. But I was there. This is something that shouldn't have happened. but it did. This is more than a story about the plane crash. It's about the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd, the greatest Southern rock band of all time. Artimus! Ronnie Van Zant's on the phone for you. From Skynyrd? Yes, come on. - Oh, my God. - I know, I know! There you go, babe. Ronnie. Hey. I've been meaning to call you. It's cool. What's going on? Well, so we came up with this idea. We're gonna bring out five sets of drums and five drummers. Have ourselves a little drum-off. Yeah, we had a little bit of a fall-out with Bob. He got a little loony for us. I'm sorry to hear about Bob, but I could dig it. All right. Our band manager will call you about the details. Cool. Thank you, man. Thank you so much. All right. See you. I'm trying out for Skynyrd. Oh, my God! Yes! I'm so proud of you. Try calling Dean again? There's no point. It's been two weeks. They must have found someone else. Hey, it's okay. - Hello? - Hello, can you hear me? Yup, who's this? Hey, it's Dean. Artimus? - Dean Kilpatrick? - Yeah, man. Look, it's loud here, but Ronnie wants to know if you can come down to Cooley's now. Uh... Right now? Yeah, yeah, no drum-off thing, Ronnie just wants to see what you got. Can you make it? Yeah, absolutely. I'll be there immediately. All right, awesome. I'll let him know you're on your way. - What's going on? - I got to go to Atlanta, baby. - Atlanta? - Yeah, Skynyrd. Right now. - I love you. - I love you. - I gotta go. - Good luck! No. No! Shit. This guy's good. Playtime. Come on, now. Let's get that energy up. I got my boys coming to the stage.

It was a good show. It was a good show. There was just a couple little hiccups. We're gonna work 'em out... ...and angry. He starts... He's yelling at us, we're getting, like, fucked-up, you know, and he's like, "Swine! Swine!" And we just start barking. Barking at him, you know? Really good show. I miss our mojo though. The sound was not fully... The sound was not the same for me. - Fuck, yeah! - Mmm! - Mmm! - Not enough. - White cross? - Hell, yeah. You go, girl. Mmm. Get out! Hold on just one minute. Uh, Ronnie just came. Let me let you go. You, get the fuck... Go! - Hey, Ronnie, you're gonna... - Fuck, dude! Go! Take your damn clothes. Get the fuck out of here. Lay the fuck down! What the fuck, man? Kevin, man. Again with the fucking feedback. It's that dang hat, man. Causes interference. It's physics. Now I ain't no scientist, and I'm pretty sure I ain't gonna be caught on stage not wearing my fuckin' hat, so you figure out how you're gonna fix it, Einstein. Yeah, and that damn mirror ball. I'm about to climb up there and yank that damn thing down myself. I like that mirror ball. Shut the fuck up, Gary. And you, Artimus. Man, I swear, you actually played better on that shit. I didn't miss a beat, man. Yeah, not this time at least. I don't have to deal with this shit, man. I need a shower. Good. Your ass stinks. Let me just do this, man. - Yo, I'm gonna do this. - Shit, man. I'm good. I'm good, man. Get him off. - Listen, man... - Hey, hey, hey. - Hey, relax, man! Jesus. - Yeah? - Listen... - Yeah, right! Who the hell are you? I'm the drummer of Lynyrd Skynyrd, man. I'm the reason you guys are here. Brother. You're the fucking man, brother. Listen, you're drunk, man. You need to relax, okay? Now listen, hey, drink some water and chill out, okay? - Good man. - Don't beat him up. Why don't you guys get him some help, man? Shit! - Sorry. - Yeah, brother. Hi! Great show, man. Good show. You guys all came to party, right? Let's get some party going. I'll do that shit right here. You want some white crosses? Oh, hey, hey! Hey, Dean. Right here, buddy. Oh, come on! I want some right here. Oh, my gosh, everyone's looking. This is rock, baby. This is how we roll. Whoo! Burns a little, but it's good. - You guys are crazy! - You want? I get to tell my friends I kissed a rock star who plays in front of hundreds of thousands of people. Once you get past those first few rows, all those people are really just a blur. Hey. Hey, no! I need you to be cool, man. Back off, man! Whoa! Get the fuck out of here. - I'll be right back. - Hurry. Hey, what the fuck do you think's your problem? You think you can touch a woman like that? - You think you're someone, huh? - Redneck, that's what you are. I'm... That guy's just a waste, man. - You seen one of these? - That's mine. Oh, well, hey. Boys' night out, Mr. Saturday Night Special. Somebody get this man a beer! Come on! Whoo! You're lucky it wasn't loaded. Yeah, man. Man, I don't know about this dance. MCA's got a song, but... Oh, man. Hell, this damn flag business has got to go. - Damn people calling us racist. - That ain't racism, man. That's Southern pride, right here. Hell, yeah. Whoa! Hey. You all right? What are you doing? - I'm tripping, right? - Yeah. Hey, you know I love you, man. - God damn! - Come on, come on! Come on, Ronnie Van Zant. Come on, Ronnie Van Zant. That's it, baby. Yeah, we got a long road ahead of us. Yeah, I miss our old bird, man. Whoo! The old turboprop. Sweet-ass plane. That Convair was good enough for Jerry Lee Lewis, it's good enough for me. How do you turn this shit on? They're supposed to be talking about us. Here, let me show you. Let me show you. Let me show you. Oh, he's gonna do it. Oh, you crazy son of a bitch. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Someone get me a gun to blow my damn brains out. - Oh, geez. - Fucking party. Hey, y'all having a good time? All right? All right! Hey, what the hell's going on in here? You boys are destroying the room. What the hell are you gonna do about it? Y'all are gonna have to pay. You hear me? Ow! Hey, man. Hey! Jesus, man. What? All right, all right. What, man? Oh, John. Everything's fucked, dude. Ronnie's in jail. But, um, here's your gold record. Don't worry about anything. Eckerman's on it, all right? What the f... Oh... You don't know how to do that! Give me that. I'll show you how to do it. Oh, baby. Oh, my God. Ow! Ooh, yeah! So the guys, they took one look at the plane, and it's a hard pass. - Wow! - I don't know what to tell you, other than to rent it out to some other suckers, but Aerosmith sure the hell ain't flying on it. Oh, and what's this I'm hearing about the pilots? Passing a bottle of Jack Daniel's back and forth during the inspection? I don't care! Just get us a better plane or we're done. To this day, I sit, sometimes for hours, and I hear the stories that people tell me about where they were when our plane went down... And how much the music means to them and their families. Whoo! Oh, what a piece of junk! Well, I guess that must be ours. It's got our name on it. But you can barely read it. Well, let's meet these jokers. How are we doing? I'm Ron. I talked to you guys. - Hi, Ron, I'm Walter. - Nice to meet you, Walter. Nice to meet you. I'm John. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - It's great to be here. Hello, everyone. Uh... I'm John Grey. I'm the co-pilot, and I just wanted to say that all my life, all I've ever dreamed of doing is flying a big rig with rock stars. Yeah, sure, man. So, after this, I'll be able to die a happy man. All right. To the plane. I'm trying to stay on there, man. Ladies and gentlemen, can we have your attention? In the event of a plane crash, we gotta work on our... On our crash positions. - Now get ready. - Yeah, yeah. We'll do our bit. Chug and pray to God. In the event of a water landing, you gotta attach your life-ladies, - as such, as such. - Oh! Your flotation devices will be located under your seats. Or if we crash on land, we could just cuddle under Billy's belly, huh? Oh, yeah, Billy. Hold on to Billy! Everyone hold on to Billy! Just hold on to Billy now. We all in? We're sitting pretty, boss. Let's get the hell outta here. Yeah! Copy that. Artimus, let me get that seat, man. I need a seat. Well, wait a second. This is a little cowabunga. This is time for some plane surfing, baby. Come on! Come on, now! Come on. Let's go, boy. - Let's do it. - I don't know about that. - Go! - Come on, Dean. - Oh, shit. - Fuck. Oh, my gosh! What you got for us, Ronnie? Let's see. Listen to this. Charlie Daniels right here. - Whoo! - Midnight Wind. Hot damn. Charlie's an animal. He's on fire. That's right. Hey, guys. But dig this. Dig this, right here. Fucking flames of glory right here. - Oh, shit. - Check this out. - Oh, shit. - Check that out, Ronnie. You see that? That's rock. Let me see. Look at that white devil in there. - They make you look good now? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Look at that handsome man. - They made us all look good. It was so good, we had to record it twice, man. I like the way my face looks. Nobody likes it. You're too skinny, Billy. That's the problem. All right. Come on. Come on, somebody get up. Let me play. Before I start flying this damn plane. I don't want to take all your money again. I'm good. I'm doing good here. You're going to be broke in two seconds. Hey, go get me another beer. Oh, yeah, man. What are you doing with... Actually, you know what? Give me the Jack. Artimus, you need something? - Yeah, give me a beer. - All right, I got you. - Jack for me, too. - All right. Bringing it out. Yo, is this shit good for headaches? - It's good for anything. - That sounds great. - Take it. Take it all. - Knocked me out, man. Coming up or coming down, I don't know what's what. Hell, yeah. - You fucking kidding me? - No. No, man. It's ridiculous. They're having fake tickets. It looks like a little coffin. And we just go full force, right out of there. - It's so cool. - Yeah. You know, I might be small, but I am mighty. - Oh, shit. - What's going on? Oh, shit. Hey, look outside the window. Did you see that? That cannot be normal. Everybody relax. Get your seatbelts on. I'm gonna call Falcon as soon as we land. - We are going to land. - Land? Buckle it up. Let's go. Hey, you guys. All that is, is just a little blowback, just like on every car. Perfectly safe. Hey, not my car, man. Cool. A little blowback? You know what? Sometimes I wanna go home. I guess you got a point. Yeah, no shit, I got a point. All I do is get points. Well, everybody's freaked the fuck out, man. You got flames shooting out of the engine. I don't blame them. What? What the hell are you talking about? No, I've been on plenty of planes. That does not happen. Listen, do me a favor and get somebody out here to fix this damn thing. Are... Are you kidding me? Fuck! All right, listen. I'm gonna talk to the guys. We'll figure this out. I'll give you a call back. Fuck. All right, listen. They can't get a mechanic out here. They're gonna get one, fly him out first thing, soon as we land in... In fucking Baton Rouge. You actually expect us to get back on that plane? Listen, it's just gas dispensing. That's what they said. I don't know, it's something... They said it's fine. Fine for them, not for me. Fuck! All right, come on. Let's get this loaded up and let's go to the hotel. Whoo! Oh, look at my man over here. Might have to buy myself a regular old ticket, meet you all there in Baton Rouge. Come on. Come on. Don't worry. - Everything's gonna work out. - Okay, Ronnie. We knew these songs backwards and forwards. So well that we only had to think about how hard we wanted to hit it, not what was coming next. I want the world to know how funny my band was. Because being the drummer of Lynyrd Skynyrd, every single day on the road was a hilarious adventure. Ronnie Van Zant told me in Tokyo, Japan, that he would not live to see the age of 30. He was 29 when he was killed. He told me that he wanted to go out with his boots on. A 95-city tour? Never even heard of one with that many. Well, I'm gonna miss you. Baby, I'm gonna miss you more. - Yeah, you better. - Come here. Oh. Looks like the circus is here. Yes, ma'am. Hey! Come on in. - Good to see you. - Hi! Good to see you. Thanks for having us over. - There he is! - It's pretty good. Where are the other fellas? Unfortunately, they, um, couldn't make it. Let's just say they went out last night. Well. Hey, that's more for the rest of us. - Come on in, have a seat. - Come on, take a seat. I got you, man. Oh. Pretty wild, man. - That was good. - Yeah, I'm stuffed. Yeah, baby. - You might have changed me. - Thank Pat. Did she actually cook it? Yeah, absolutely. She's the best, man. See you on the other side. A 10-foot flame? I don't blame him for going commercial. I mean, you should, too. Listen, the name of the tour is Tour of the Survivors. So, we're gonna survive, baby. - That ain't funny. - It's a little funny. - No, Artimus, it ain't funny. - Shit. Listen, it's just the pilots. They ran the mix a little rich last night. They'll be fine this time. Well, how did Ronnie manage to convince Cassie? You know Ronnie. He could sell papers to a paperboy. Ain't that the truth. ♪ Southern feeling wakes me at first light ♪ Warming glow of the sun Everything's all right ♪ Walkin' the seasons beneath the grand sky ♪ Take it easy in this life Each day... ♪ Fly safe. Yeah, baby. I'll tell that to the pilots. - Love you, Pat. - I love you, too. Bye. It was good to see you boys. - Thanks again. - Yeah, of course. Of course. - Take it easy, Pat. - Have fun. - You sure? - Always. Good to see you, Ron. - Be good. - Take care. Missed you this morning, man. Yeah, I missed you last night. Did you forget? Breakfast. Tell Pat I'm sorry, man. She expected it, man. She told me you weren't gonna make it. She knows you better than you know your damn self. At least someone does. I just wanted you to see the house you helped me buy. You know, man, tell her I'll be there. Just tell her not to be cooking that rabbit food whenever I do. Hey... - Uh-uh. - Go get 'em. - You get some rest, man. - Yes, thank you. Damn, Allen. You look stiffer than a brick, man. Yeah, well. Just bought a goddamn ticket out of Spartanburg... And? What do you think? Ronnie ripped it up. That sounds about right. I'm really scared, man. Some weird energy out here, man. - Right out there... - Yeah. That's the last place I saw my dad. Before he died in that crash? Yes, sir. Thanks for sharing, you morbid bastard. Now I'm scared and sad. I don't know about you. I need a beer. You want one? I'm good. Shit. I never lost consciousness. And I knew at the end, when everything came silent... And I started... thinking of survival. I'm just saying that I could have returned the ticket and gotten some money back. You didn't have to rip it up. Hey, well, how much was the damn ticket? - Look, I'll pay you back. - That's not the problem. What do you need? How much? Go. I don't want your money. I'm just making a point. Y'all can walk to Baton Rouge for all I care. I mean, it'll take you, like, what, two weeks? That's all? Are you kidding? Not again! That's not funny, Ronnie. Hey, it was a joke, Cassie. Go on! You know that's funny! Damn. What was that? It's just, uh, a little fuel got in the exhaust and it burnt itself out. Nothing to be alarmed about. You guys are killing me. Yes, ma'am. Be aware, you have flights ahead of you. Roger that, They should be off by now, right? It's unbelievable. Hey, if your number's up, your number's up. Doesn't matter if you're on a plane or a bus. I mean, we all gotta go at some point. Fuck. Not helping, Ronnie. All right, relax. Falcon wouldn't give us a bad plane, guys. Now you're really not helping. Come on, move over. We're gonna get there, all right? Billy, you can have the other half. - You don't want it? - You can have it. Hell, yeah. Slap my ass and call me surprised. - Nothing ready yet, Artimus? - Yeah. All right, well, now you can chill about that. That's genius there, partner. That's what I'm saying, Ronnie. What I told you, Ronnie. - Billy, you got something... - What is it? What is it? That's a lot... You gonna beat him, Gary? - Shut the fuck up! - Ooh. No, keep playing, man. I like it. All right, here you go. You know what? Let me get a... I'm telling you, y'all are gonna be in Okie's shadow. I'm fine! As long as I got free drinks, right? Getting more and more comfortable by the second. So, guys, I'm going all in. Y'all about to lose. I'm calling your bluff, Ronnie. Shit. Damn. But the bad thing is, I got a straight flush. Son of a bitch. - God damn. - There you go. No, I gotta hang out longer with you jokers. Come on. - Nice. - I'll buy in for you. I don't want you too fucked up, man. Let me get you something for that, all right? Man, I'll be fine. You got any Anacin back there, bring it. No, I'm gonna get you water, all right? - Water's for pussies. - He's right, man. Come on, Leon, he needs it. - You need it, man. - I don't need it. Come on. I said I'm fine. You wanna take a lude, man? I'm gonna do right now. I don't want that either. You filled up, right? Yeah, I mean... I put at least, I don't know, 400 gallons in Greenville? - 400? - The gauge was reading way higher than this. We're running auto-rich with a bad mag. Did you stick it? I stuck it... What? In Florida. - But not in SC? - No. I mean, come on. There's no way we burned that much fuel already. We were at least 70% when I was refueling. The gauge has to be off. Always double check with a dipstick. Always. That's a hell of a thing to say now, Ronnie, isn't it? I say, bollocks! Fucking Rudge, man. You sound just like him, man. I don't trust him at all. I mean, all he wants is the money. Fucking entertainment. Hell, Ron does all the work. He should be managing us. He takes 26%. Come on, that's too much. Mark my words, this time next month when the deal is up, everything goes south. Not New-fucking-York. I'm talking about our own studios in Jacksonville. Loading docks. Rooms for the girls. All of them. Hell, with all the money that they've taking from us, we could have had a whole damn complex up and running. Y'all get that? And be on a Learjet, not this piece of crap prop plane. Amen. I'm gonna pass out, man. Yeah, I'm gonna pass out, too. I'll go ahead. After taking all our money, of course. There you go. - Get you some rest, Ronnie. - We got next game. - You want in? - Billy does. You hop on in. I'm hopping out. As long as he splits that money. Oh, man, he's gonna split his pants before he splits the money. Oh! We've heard that one before. He won every time. All right, I'm starting fresh. - Stepping in, Dean? - Go on, man. McComb is 40 miles up. I saw we make a pitstop and top her off. I don't know. These guys have got a show to play. I say we divert, we fill up, we'll be back up in an hour. We're only 100 miles to Baton Rouge. We're fine. Both engines have been running auto-rich the whole time? In this bird? Always. They got all them new toys loaded up. We might be heavier than we think. It's your call, but we don't wanna be the reason these guys are late. Les will be pissed, not to mention the investigation. You know what that means. At least a month of headaches and docked pay. I'd say genius. - Just hit 100. - You need about 100, that's some ballsy shit. I only got them... - 200. - All right. Oh, oh... Y'all hear that? Oil. Is that fucking oil? - Did you say oil? - Oil? It's fucking oil. Oh, shit. It can't be. We should have diverted. Well, you spin this bird right back to McComb. We can't. It's too far now. It'd be the same distance just to keep going. - What's going on, man? - What do you mean, oil? You hear that? Hey, what's going on? What do you mean it's oil? Don't worry, man. It's all right. Please tell me that was just some choppy air back there. That was the, uh... I was an aviation sergeant in the Marines for four years. What's going on with the gauge? We're reading empty. - The gauge is off. - The gauge is off? Jeez, man. It sounds like the right engine's about to blow. Hey, what the hell's going on, man? Hey, what's going on? This doesn't feel good at all. Fuck, man. That doesn't sound good. - Whoa! - What the fuck? Hey, man, back there, what's going on? Hey, man, back there, what's going on? Hey, stay calm. Stay calm. - This is some shit, man. - Artimus! What's going on back there? Center, Convair, 55 Victor Mike. 55 Victor Mike, go ahead. Yes, sir, we need an airport. Closest airport you got, sir. Houston Center, roger. Are you saying this is emergency status? We are running low on fuel and just about out of it. We want vectors to McComb. Post-haste, please, sir. Roger. Vectors to McComb, fly heading 025, 05 heading. We are not declaring an emergency, but we do need to get as close to McComb... Close as we can get, sir. Roger. I understand you're out of fuel. I'm sorry, it's just an indication of it. We're at 4.5. Roger. What the hell was that? Oh, my God. This plane can ride on one engine for a while. I've seen it. Plus, it can glide plenty. This bird can hold 80 people with luggage, and we only got 26. We should be fine. Feathering the prop. Bullshit, man. - We lost the starboard engine. Turn the lights off. - Oh, shit. - What? - Stop smoking. Listen, we need to conserve energy. Turn off all the lights. - Fuck! - Shut that off. - We're gonna be okay, right? - I'll get Ronnie. It'll be all right, man. Get it, go. Buckle up your seatbelts. Turn this TV off. Hey, man, we gotta get you in your seat. I gotta get him up, man. We gotta get him in his seat. This is some bullshit. I'm turning this plane around. 60 miles to McComb. Be a hair closer than to keep going. All right, whatever is left in those wing tanks, transfer it now. I said transfer it, not dump it. Damn it, I'm sorry! We get out of this alive, I'm gonna kill you. - I didn't mean to. - Shut up! This is some bullshit! Get to your seat, Ronnie. We're completely out of gas! It's just an indication of it. You gotta be kidding me, man! There's 26 souls on this plane. - Yo, Ron... - What's the matter? - Ron, you fucking... - Buckle up! You fucked us, Ron. This is your fucking fault, man. - Hey, Leon... - Fucking bullshit, man. - Buckle up, Leon. - I'll fucking die in this shit. Stop it, guys. It's nothing, we're okay. Ron, this is on you, man! If we survive this, I'm gonna fucking kill him! Come on, man. I'll fuck you up. MV-55V, Mayday. MV-55V, Mayday! Mayday! Hey, get off him, man. Hey, Leon, Leon! MV-55V, Mayday. Shit! You best go back and strap yourself in. We're out of gas! We're out of gas! Listen, everyone return to your seats. - Go sit down. - Put your seatbelt on. - Buckle up! - Put your seatbelts on now. Buckle up, get to your seats. Get to a seats. We can glide for awhile. We can glide for awhile. We'll put it down somewhere soft. Oh, God. - Let's find a place to land. - Got it. Not yet! God damn it. Retract them! Retract them! I thought you wanted me to. Christ, are you trying to kill us? We don't know where we're gonna land yet. Sorry. Landing gear? No. It's too early to put the landing gear down. Wheels are gonna drag us! Ronnie, what are you doing? - Ronnie, Ronnie... - Sit down, man. Ronnie, get to your seat, man. Ronnie, sit down. Ronnie, get in your seat. Ronnie, what are you doing? Go back to your seat, Ronnie. Love you guys. I'm going down, man. I ain't gonna live to see 30. Oh, that's bullshit, man. No, no, no. Ronnie Van Zant, you're gonna live forever. Yeah? No, man. But, hey, I'll tell you this. When I do go, I'm going with my boots on. Come on, man. Find a seat. - Find a seat! - Sit down, Ronnie! One more for the road, gentlemen. Ronnie, not now, man. Ronnie, not now. All right. We're gonna try and hit that road over there. Or at least that field. Houston, can you read? Houston. Shit. Tell them to brace for impact. Go! We're gonna try for the field or the interstate. Fuck you! Shit. Trees! Brace! Don. Don. My... My stomach. The stomach. Ahhh! Hey, hey. Relax. Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! I'm gonna get you out. Okay. I'm gonna get help. - I gotta get help. - Don't leave me here. I can't... Don't go. Okay, okay. Listen, listen. I gotta get you out. Okay? I gotta get you out. - Ahhh! It hurts! - Breathe. Listen, listen. - Come on, man. - Listen, I need you to breathe. Okay? Breathe. Breathe. I gotta get this. Ahhh! Fuck! No. Cassie? Cassie. I'm going to get help. I'll be back. Help... Listen, Paul. I'm going to tourniquet you. Listen, I gotta release the pressure, okay? All right? Here we go. On three. One, two... Ahhh! Breathe. Breathe, man. I need you to breathe, okay? - Get it out, nice and slow. - Okay. Ahhh! Ahhh! Help! I'm trapped! Leon. Hey, Paul. Paul! Paul! Listen, listen to me. I need you to breathe. - I need you to breathe. - Where are the pilots? Where are the fucking pilots? I gotta go, okay? I gotta go find help. - Where are the pilots? - Listen... Breathe for me. You can do it. You're gonna fucking live. Where are the pilots? Leon! Where are the goddamn pilots? - Billy? - Leon. Leon! Billy. You okay? Where are the pilots? - Billy, are you okay? - We have to get the pilots. - They have the radio. - Listen to me! I gotta get you out. No, go get the pilots. They have the radio. - Go get the pilots. - What about Leon? Go get the fucking pilots. - Let me help. - He's out. He's out. Go get the fucking pilots 'cause we need this radio. Just go! All right. All right. Fuck, man. All right. Help! - I'll get you out of here. - Get me out of here, man. Get this shit off me! I can't move my legs! Artimus! Artimus. - His leg is stuck. - He's trapped. Get this shit off me! I can't move shit! One, two, three. Come on, man! I can't move! I can't move! Listen, Kenny, Mark. - What? - I'm going to get help. - Yeah. - Stay here with Gary. Okay? Hey, stay here. Okay? Artimus. - Hold on. - Help! I'm gonna get you out of here. - I can't move. I can't move! - Breathe, Gary. It's all right, man. Allen. Allen. You're alive. Leslie. Okay. Hey, I'm going to get help. Leslie. I can't move my neck. Hey, just calm down, and breathe. I just need you to breathe. Okay? Just breathe, nice and slow. I'll be back. I'm going to get help. Ronnie. Ronnie. Fuck! Leslie, Allen, I'm going to get help. When I was walking out from the plane crash, my only thought was to get to help. I knew that my friends needed help, and I needed to go get that help. Because every person that was bleeding, every drop of blood was closer to someone dying. So, every second counted. And that day, I wanted to be a lifeline to everybody. I'll bite your fucking head off! Shit. Hey! - Hey! - Get in the car, boys! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Help! Shit. - I need help. - Stop! My friends, they need help. They're... Put the gun down. Don't you take another step! - Stop! - Put the gun down. Please! What are you doing? Please stop. Shit. - My plane just crashed. - I'm so sorry. Let's get you some help. Come on. I'll take you in, come on. Oh, fuck, dude, my arm. Fuck! Come on. He had a plane crash. - Hello? - Pat. Pat, it's me. Listen, we had a plane crash. Did you see it on the TV? What? Wait... No, no, I'm fine. Baby, I'm fine. I gotta go. I gotta go, I love you. I gotta get help. I love you so much. Someone call the police. We gotta go. We gotta get help. Come on. Come on, I got you. Come on. Get in. Over here! Come on. Come on! Crash is that way. Over the hills, through the swamp. No, no, no. Go. Go help them. - Sir, it's okay. - Over there, through the swamp. - Look at me. Hey, hey. - Through the swamp. - Hey. Hey! - Go. Over the swamp. - Hey, hey, focus. Focus! - Over the hills. Your injuries are very serious... No. We have to show them where it is. - We'll find it. We'll find it. - Get this man to a hospital. - We got this. - Get off me. - Come on, now. Stop it. - They need my help right now. - Stop it. We've got this. - We'll take care of it. You got my word, okay? Come on. Come on. - Come on, man! - I can take him. Get this man to a hospital now! - Right over here. - Take you to the truck. Right down here. Hey, look at me. We got this. - Okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Watch your step. That's it, we got you. J.D., start the truck! Okay, look at me. We got this. - Listen, man... - I'm okay. That's what we're here for, sir. - Come on, we've got this. - Come on, I got you. - Watch your step. - I got you. Easy, man! - Really, man? - I'm sorry! God, I just survived a plane crash. I got shot. - You trying to kill me in a wreck? - No, sir. What the fuck do you do? I'm a lawyer. Well, counselor, why don't you slow the fuck down? - Let's go. - Understood. Here they come. My God. - Where's your pal? - Don't worry, I'm fine. Do you know what happened? Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. - You know where you are? - I'm fine. - All right. Sit down right over here on the gurney. I just need you to sit down right here. There you go. The other leg. Lie back. And go. Sir, lie down. Relax. Why don't you have some oxygen right here? - There we go. - I don't need that. I think you really do. I think you do, so, just relax, breathe in. Breathe out, breathe in. There you go. Breathe out. You're all right. You're all right now. Exam room five. Exam room five. Mr. Pyle, I want you to stay awake for me, all right? Can you show me your hands? On a scale of one to five, how much pain are you in right now? Four? I see a three right there. Corner, corner. Trauma coming in. All right, here we go. Take on deep breath. One, two, three, lift. Okay. Mr. Pyle, I just need you to remain real calm, okay? Remain real still. Just remain still. Oh, boy. Ah. Sorry. Artimus, I'm Dr. Jones. We're here to take care of you. What we need to know is how many others were on the airplane with you. Ronnie. Ronnie. And Gary. And Billy. And Leon. At the TV road crew and my band... We need to run some more tests. - No, fuck the tests. - You may have some broken bones. I'll let you know as soon as we find out. Fuck, man. It didn't feel like the end of the world at the time. It felt like, we're gonna go on. We're gonna be survivors. But when you lose your lead singer and especially somebody like Ronnie Van Zant... That's it. You know, you're done. And, uh, it took a while for that to sink in. Come on, Ronnie Van Zant. Come here! I got you. Artimus. You said you wanted to know who didn't survive. Tell me. Ronald Wayne Van Zant. Wow. Steve Gaines. Cassie Gaines. Dean Kilpatrick. And the pilot, Walter McCreary and the co-pilot, John Gray. I'm sorry. You're lucky you survived. I'm lucky? Oh! Pardon me, man, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one's allowed in there, right? My friend Leon's in there. I gotta go see him. Well, I understand that, but I can't let you in there. Listen, don't put your hands on me. I'm here to see him. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't let you in, okay? Just doing my job. That's cool and all, but I'm gonna get in that room. - I can't let you in there. - Don't put your hands on me. - You need to take it easy. - I'm getting in that room right now. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, stop! That's Artimus Pyle. He's in the band. He was in the crash, man. I'm sorry, man. Oh... Leon. It's me, man. It's Artimus. Hey. Fuck, man. Hey, man. Yeah. Are you sure you wanna do this? Yeah, man. I have to. Let's... Let's go. Artimus. That's Artimus. Artimus, tell us what happened. Artimus. Back off. No photos, please. Artimus. Artimus, please help us out. Just a statement. Please let us know... Are you guys gonna be making music again? - Artimus, can you talk to us? - Artimus, please. Hey, hold on. Jesus Christ. It's a miracle anyone survived. This was just a bunch of stoners, if you ask me. I wonder if they even noticed what happened. He was probably too high. What the fuck did you just say? What the fuck did you just say? What's your problem, man? - Artimus! Hey! - What the fuck did you just say? What's your problem, man? - Chill out. - What the hell, man? People died here, man. Have some fucking respect! Hey, I'm sorry. I was just foolin'. - People died! - Come on. Come on. Chill. I'm sorry. Hey, hey... All right. It's all right, brother. It's all right. It's all right. Hey, chill out, man. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on. Mr. Pyle. We need to speak to you with regards to some of the items found. Items? What... What are you talking about? Why don't you just follow us and we'll show you. What do you mean? You can follow us, or we could bring you. We'll follow them. Come on. What the... Artimus Pyle. Agent Wallace, DEA. Big fan. It's terrible what happened. The thing is... we found these... in what appears to be your luggage. As you know, trafficking narcotics across state lines, federal offense. - Narcotics? - Yes, sir. - This is Ginseng. - Whoa. Whoa. Agent... You ever heard of seng hunters? - Excuse me? - Old guys, go out in the forest they look for ginseng. - Ginseng? - It's a root extract. It's good for your brain. Y'all should take some. Unbelievable. This isn't illegal, man. What the heck is going on here, man? - Relax. - Ahem. We'll look into this. Am I free to go? You can go. We'll be in touch. It's looking much better. Thank you, nurse. Mr. Pyle. Excuse me. Um, I need to know how you plan to take care of all these hospital bills. What the fu... My... My label will take care of these. - Yeah. - Mr. Pyle... We've been trying to sort this out. I really need your help. Well, this... That's not... Can I borrow that phone there? Thank you. Peter Rudge, please? It's Artimus Pyle. Artimus is on the line. Artimus, uh... Go on, mate. I... I don't even know what to say. I'm terribly sorry, mate. Cut the shit. Listen... I need you to give me some money right now. You gotta take care of my medical bills. You know, mate, I... We're stuck in a corner on this one, right? I mean, it's... There's nothing we can do, mate. You're stuck? There's nothing you've tried to do. People died. Listen, this is your fault. You gave us a shit plane, man. This is bullshit, Peter. You haven't been there for us. Listen, Artimus. You don't have a contract with us, mate. Whatever deal you had, that was between you and Ronnie. We're just not liable for your medical bills, mate. I'll tell you what, mate. I'm gonna make a few calls and I'll call you right back, all right? I'm fucking done. I'm done with you, man. Pardon my language, miss. Mr. Pyle. Mr. Pyle! There's not a bad Lynyrd Skynyrd song. And as the drummer of Lynyrd Skynyrd, I know that each song has a different drum part. There's no two the same. The little nuances, the stops, the starts, the dynamics. And I love being the drummer of Lynyrd Skynyrd. It has saved my life... And all the chaos. But the band was incredible, and Ronnie was incredible. And he was the undisputed leader of Lynyrd Skynyrd. ♪ I was born on the west side of the place that I call home ♪ My daddy was a truck drivin' man Spent his life out on the road ♪ Seen my share of troubles by the time I turned 16 ♪ Mama did the best she could But the streets can be so mean ♪ Ain't no place for a country boy to be ♪ I've been knocked down Laid out, left for dead ♪ Some call me crazy Say I'm outta my head ♪ I've always been a gambler and a fighter ♪ A rebel and a writer ♪ When the world looks at me ♪ They see... ♪ They see a street survivor ♪ I've traveled this old road I've been around a time or two ♪ ...ain't nothing I won't do ♪ Took the wheel Went from Montana down to LA ♪ Lots of people know me ♪ And they know I ain't here to stay ♪ They all know to stay out of my way ♪ I've been knocked down Laid out, left for dead ♪ Some call me crazy Say I'm outta my head ♪ I've always been a gambler and a fighter ♪ A rebel and a writer ♪ When the word looks at me They see... ♪ They see a street survivor ♪
