"President Truman tells us about this new source of energy. We now have this tremendous responsibility. And we thank God for having chosen us instead of our enemies." Enemy to the right... Enemy to the left... "We have discovered the source of solar power, nuclear power." "This incredible power..." And a final one... "Ushers us into the greatest era of all times." Qmar, wait! Kalt! It's set up! BEDWIN HACKER Go on, after you! I knew you'd do it. You're the best, auntie! Please don't call me that! You'll keep your promise, right? School comes first. To my grandmother, Bibi, who inspires me with the courage to resist. ...namely women and children. The organization for illegal immigrants stated... Mama! Mama's in Paris. They hit mama! Don't be afraid, mama's fine. What's that? I told you! Don't play with sharp things! Do what you like, I'm going to get her. Julia! - Do I know you? - I sent you an e-mail. Not interested, thanks! That guy came at me hard! Did you hit him before or after? What does it matter! I hit a cop, Julia. No citizenship and I hit a cop! Don't freak out! They came in rough too. But they didn't expect live cameras! It was live enough for me! I don't know how I rescued my lute! If you hadn't run it'd be a one-way ticket to Algiers! - You're not staying? - No, I have to work. What, more new viruses? I'm going to invent one myself. "I Hate You". Another headhunter's after me. He might show up. But you haven't seen me, OK? Bye. Wow! Your woman's into her work! No time, even for a drink! The journey of an undocumented woman. Frida! Miss, over here please! Your ID. - What's going on? - Just an ID check. Lay off them! Papers, please. in Khaled's chorus! Some show! You're headed for a charter plane! What do I say to Qmar? I promised her I'd bring you back to Midès. I'm not like Mehdi. Imagine leaving Algiers for this dump! I don't love him any more. And Qmar? Enough! We have translators! Do you speak French? Is that what you'd ask people who buy your Champs-Elysées. Full name, address, residence permit number. You can leave if you like. So, full name? Frida Mamri isn't usually addressed in that tone. M-A-M-R-I. Can I call from my mobile? Mme Kalthoum here. We've got a slight problem at the precinct in the 18th. Lella Frida left home without her papers again. Born in Morocco. Her Excellency would appreciate the ambassador's intervention. - Do I look like an idiot? - Ah! A change of tone? Go. Where do you think you're going? Diplomatic Passport. Niece of the King of Morocco. Terribly sorry, we had no idea. You're obviously free to leave. Please accept our apologies. Would you like an escort? Thank you, that won't be necessary. Come on, let's go... Chams, How are you? This is Kalt! She's the brains around here. She just got me out of a jam. I could have gone to a hotel but Frida insisted. Stay as long as you like! You're welcome. I don't believe it! Agent Marianne? Zbor, I've told you never call when I'm undercover! Only in emergencies! This is serious. Someone altered an ID down at the 18th. You traced it? Just as the officer logged on, someone tapped in and changed the ID data. Nobody noticed anything. Typical cop! "Frida Mamri. King of Morocco's niece. Special procedure. Treat with care. "VIP." Her papers indicate immigrant status, a housing certificate under the name: Chams. She's at my boyfriend's! I know her... She doesn't know the first thing about computers. Well, whoever pulled this one off is a real pro! Julia... Sorry, agent Marianne, if I report it, they'll repossess the equipment at his place. Leave it, I'll handle it! Let's go. Enter code. Transferred for Bedwin Hacker. "In the third millennium, there are other epochs, other places, other lives... We are not a mirage..." Data being processed. Hacking attempt confirmed. You sure that's what it says? Strange, it's in Tunisian! It's open! Where do you think you are, with the doors open, back home? What's with the Arabic on TV? Julia? OK. I'll call you back. I asked Julia to meet me here but she can't. Seems someone hacked into the TV satellite? That's what I said! They sent a message in Arabic. They're nuts? So, I suppose agent Marianne needs a chopper? That won't be necessary. We can dismiss the Islamic trail - the message doesn't begin with the usual "Allah Akbar". So now you read Arabic? No. But I spot differences. Islamic sites don't usually open like this. The satellite they used doesn't reach either Africa or Asia. They used an Arabic dialect. Translation... You call two lines a text? Chief, if you keep interrupting... "In the third millennium, there are other epochs, other places, other lives..." How philosophical! "We're not mirages." Mirage...? The hacker from the 18th... Get their videotape, now! Agent Marianne, this case is our priority. Mirage is a reference to a famous hacker, sir: Pirate Mirage. Hey, our first Arab hacker! We're gonna have the press on our backs about the suburbs! Your assistant's a real pain! The source probably comes from where they were thrashed rather than North Africa! We'll start with disinformation. Nobody can take control of the airwaves and say whatever they like! I need hard facts. That's like finding a needle in a haystack! Stand-by around the clock! We'll compile press conference material every morning at 5:30 am. So you speak to us in Arabic... Dad came home one day and found Kalt with the TV in pieces. She was putting it back together again! She was 10! I never did Physics homework at school. Kalt always did it! It was the same on all the European channels! They must be furious. Great! You're the ones who are mad! They'll find us, you'll see. Don't be afraid, Mama, the aerial's down. I wish we were back in Tunis and all this was over with. Let's drink to the health of the gang. Long live the free spirit of the Djinn! Minds are always free! Stop making fun of my doctoral thesis! To your health, gang of little faith! You think that's funny - sending Aïd to prison! Typical, Algerians always see the worst! That's because they're not deluded! Put two together and you get an opposition party, a support committee and elections! Give us a break with your politics! Everything is political! Ah! Disinformation from DST already? Sorry about earlier, but I don't go there often and couldn't speak freely. - Did you go by the house? - Yeah, I had a bite to eat. I won't be home tonight. The hacking case? Chams, I have something important to tell you, I analysed your hard disk. Did someone at your place log on over the past few days? Why did you analyse my hard disk? Did you see the girl who came for Frida? I bumped into her briefly, yes. But, I haven't heard any more from her. Frida gone... Bumped into her? Didn't she sleep there? Did Frida tell you that? I have my doubts about that girl. Like what? Three days ago, someone scrambled the police file and got Frida off! What's that got to do with Kalt? I analysed your disk to save you from the trouble. There's no tape in the 18th. Good! But the officer on duty won't forget the King's niece. Can you imagine the fix I'd be in. Pirate Mirage isn't the only one who can cover up a break-in. Zbor! You didn't do that! No. Should I get on decoding this? This is hieroglyphics! And the chief's so paranoid about the press that he wants us to invent a technical error. We won't be getting much sleep tonight. "The camel sent from the skies..." From the skies is right... Did the search throw up any other information? We asked the Tunisians for help. They have no trace of the hacking. Lots of relay stations are in the south. They want a report, and they'll see how they can co-operate. Hello, Am Salah. Have you seen your front lights? They did a terrible paint job! I've spent ten years repairing and working on this! You shouldn't leave a car like that outside! Don't you have a garage? Kalthoum took it. Kalthoum, always Kalthoum. Now that you mention her, I haven't seen her for ages. She's working all the time. Have you heard of tele-working? She repairs computers via remote control. That's progress! What about your daughter Malika? Still into music! She's due to accompany the singer Leila Frida for a concert at El Jem. - You want an invitation? - Yes! That'd be great! OK, I'll bring it around later. Don't bother, I'll drop by and I can see the girls at the same time. is caused by faulty satellite transmission... "I'm not a technical error. This is my path, I march to the beat of my own drum. You who hate the sound of boots wear your babouches tomorrow. Bedwin. It's not over." Here we go again. "I'm not a technical error. This is my path, You who hate the sound of boots wear your babouches tomorrow. Bedwin, it's not over." - What is that? - Nothing! It's not nothing. Is the camel back? This time, he's telling us to go out in our babouches! This bastard's making us look like bloody fools. Bed-win: what's that mean in English? A Brit who thinks he's good in bed! What? The signature! Bed and win. Bedouine is the feminine of Bedouin! Hackers don't care about spelling. I still think that it's the famous Pirate Mirage! What good's that to me? If there's a network, as usual with hackers, we need to find the source site. They used the same satellite with a different encryption - we've been had! They've created a very elaborate system. Give me something concrete, an organisation, a demand. - All we can do for now is react. - How? By trying to decode the encryption and tracing the path of the message. We need to find the broadcast location. And what about this hacking business at the police station in the 18th? Apparently, that's the work of a mobile hacker. Unfortunately, in the confusion the officer didn't record the person's identity. There's no proof? And your friend? Didn't she stay with him? That's clever for someone who wants citizenship! - Anything yet from the decoding? - I'm on it. Agent Marianne results are what counts! I'll read you the last part - I've little time to send it. "In this wonderful "world order" we still have great troublemakers! They broadcast messages of peace... in Arabic. Is that sufficient to justify calling them technical errors?" You're a little partisan - especially at the end... I think their disinformation is disgusting! There are laws, and they have to be kept. If not it's chaos. There it goes! These hackers are like everybody else. There's a very famous one who cracked the secret defense files - from the Chaos Computer Club. They nicknamed her Pirate Mirage, because she covers her tracks like nobody else! Oh yeah! And you think there's a link between Pirate Mirage and Kalt? What's your problem? You want to hand her in? She's gone! So, the little camel on the TV worked! It's no laughing matter. I meant to tell you, as I haven't finished the article, Frida invited me to come to Tunis. You're going to Tunis? To write an article about Frida - that's a bit farfetched isn't it? No. My editor thinks it's a good idea to see the other side of the story about "illegal" immigrants. To get beyond the usual clichés. Chams, I don't believe that story! Julia, I often travel to write an article! Exactly! You can use the opportunity to get the gin on Kalt and her gear, if by chance you go to see her! Hello. I'm delighted. This is my first time in Tunisia. - My family comes from... - Hold on, hold on. Did you walk out of a Mexican soap? Don't you speak Tunisian? No, classical Arabic. Journalist? Here for professional reasons? Yes, I'm working on an article on the poet Salah El's latest work. Hotel? None, I'm being picked up. OK. Kalt! Good trip? Hi, welcome! Rule number one: no emotional outbursts in public! This is for you. Shall we go? Clear off the table... Can you pass me a beer? - Malika. - I know, Dad. I got you a headlight at the scrap yard. Thank you. What was it I wanted to ask... Ah yes, invitations for the concert. For the hairdresser, the neighbourhood grass... He'll be delighted and it will keep him quiet for a while. He asked me about Kalt. You said nothing I hope?! Of course I did. That you were busy. That you had lots of work. Thanks, Uncle. By the way! A guy called... Chams! He's a journalist, I think. He's writing an article on me. See where he can stay. Dad, Frida got him a room at Selma and Raja's. Thanks. I could have put him in Kalt's garage! How dare you speak like that! We may be in the world of satellite technology but we're still in the Middle Ages here! Frida, it's no time to joke with this Chams guy writing imaginary articles only a week after hacking into the TV. I see, if it's about me the whole thing is imaginary. Is he writing about you or Am Salah? - The official line is Am Salah. - You're kidding! We haven't stirred from Tunis and you're already forgetting Mides! The spaghetti was nearly overcooked again. Al dente, that's eight minutes. Not one second longer! Drink up! 15 minutes to go! What authority! Are you like that at home? At home I'm worse! They're still talking about the hacker. They think it's the fundamentalists. They've called in a sociologist, a futurologist, an Islamist expert, a computer expert... He's taking the piss! We haven't received Le Figaro for the past few days. It's become a subversive newspaper! See that guy? He wrote the article in Libe - not bad. Kalt told me 9 o'clock! Here, 9 o'clock can mean 10... Or even 11! I think this is for you! Good evening, welcome. Let's sit down somewhere. Can you turn the music down? Listen: "If one day I die amongst you... But will I ever die? Do not read me the Fatiha. Do not open up the gates of Paradise before me. Do not scatter the grape seeds on my tomb..." Never leave your mobile where she can get it. But, Julia... Don't you think you're losing it? Just to check... If you can get up on her roof, check the aerial type. That's not why I'm here. Besides, people only have terraces here. Chams, I trust you. If it's her, I'm bringing her down. There's no hint of a terrorist organization around here! You know... Nobody believes your story about an article. Uncle Salah has been writing for 30 years. We say nothing and you think we don't know what's going on! But I do have to finish. True love! We know what it's like! - But I'm not in love with Frida. - And Kalt? What are you up to? Kalt has to see... Tunis is so small! You can't avoid meeting. It's magic! He says he's working on it. Sure, until one of his spells works. He'll look good then! You should order a potion for Kalt. - What do you mean, for Kalt? - What'd you buy, Mourad? It's for you, all you need to spice up your love life. It's not even the season! And us - nothing for us? Can we see each other tonight? Come by around eight. 8 o'clock European time or eastern time? Guess... You'd better not miss the lute maker again... Let me get this right... I can either go see a film tonight, or get drunk. Do whatever you like, I'll do the same. Listen! If you meet Zarga at Bab Jeddid, near the hammam, ask him to get in touch, I need him. See ya later. The message bears no resemblance to a political demand of any kind. The tone is different from that which we have come to expect from Islamic quarters. It is hard to credit the official discourse... Zbor? I have a buddy in Tunis. He just traced a hacker from an Italian server. It's signed Pirate Mirage. I knew it! I'm coming. What's going on? An informer just sent news from Tunis. Pirate Mirage found my address through the network. Can't be traced but the hacker's logo is on it. It stands for computer gear: a mocam, a MUX. What kind of double Dutch is this? A MUX is a multiplexer! It mixes different digital signals with the computer data. Then they transmit to the INMARSAT satellites. - Are you on the trail? - Of Pirate Mirage? We'll see about that. There are jurisdictional problems with this kind of search, but if you want to wait for the official commission... Agent Marianne, I know we don't share the same talents! Nor the same values! But you'll understand... you'll see! T'as raison, p'tite gouine. "ZAP REALITY Et je te couperai les nichon! AT ONE MINUTE TO MIDNIGHT CALL 0150403020, THEN DIAL 666! BEDWIN IS NOT A TECHNICAL ERROR! What are these people paid for? It's impossible, it's too short to analyse. The hacker used the same 128-bit encryption bits - like the other messages. Decoding here we come! I mean... we're crosschecking, but there are jurisdictional problems... We identified the satellite, but pinpointing the broadcast location in such little time... We haven't succeeded in cutting the transmission. Bloody hell! This is worse than a bomb! And the press will broadcast these messages. If it happened 20 times a day, we'd nab them. But the hacker can strike at any time. That's the bloody problem! - Shit! Chams! - What was that? Nothing. Just can't get a connection. The news isn't good. The phone number and code. Point to the central telephone exchange at La Defense. It they crash all the servers, routers and reboots, the system will overload and melt down. - In English? - La Defense will shut down! Cut all the lines at once and notify all emergency services. Is the aerial down? Yes, auntie. Qmar, from now on, don't touch anything, OK? We'll be back soon, with Mama. Qmar, I have to go now. Do you have an urgent job? You haven't seen me once since I arrived! In Tunisia we say, "The best is always worth waiting for." Frida told me you're a computer whiz, that you tinker with modems, that you can even hack the FBI... Frida dreams things up and she has a big mouth! Did you come to learn about computers? I have other ideas... What's going on? Hold on! Turn off the damn mobile when you sleep over! No, no. I'm not at the hotel. What? But that's impossible! I'm with the Clan. I'm not winding you up. The Clan is the name of the house! Yeah, where Kalt lives. in a flat in the garden. Has he converted to Buddhism? I was with her all evening. - So? - So what? What's he doing? I met Zarga. What did he say? Your machine... a MUX? Funny name. As soon as he has it, he'll call you. A sort of dish, what? Square? I can't see a thing. I'll go back to the hotel, I can't talk here. No, Julia, I don't have a sleepy voice Julia! Control? What do you mean control? Well here "control" means, "Your lady pulls the strings." - Did she cop on? - What? No, just a work call... In the middle of the night? They must be stressed out in your office! It was the paper, they're on to Bedwin hacker. - He hit the Montparnasse Tower! - Is that right? - I swear. - Really? A man by the name of Pierre contacted me about a chip for mu mobile phone. I didn't understand why. You have to find a way of getting me connected to her machines. You want me to play the secret agent. What if she cops on? So what? What is this? What?! I think Kalt is Bedwin Hacker! No way! Do you even know her? We met at Polytechnics. I was graduating when she started. You know her? You know Kalt? She had the reputation of a maverick, very independent. She was friendly to me, too... Charming, isn't she? Hold on! You knew she came to get Frida in Paris? Look, recognise anybody? That's my apartment! Shut up and look. I brought some croissants. I'd say our intellectual friend is quite a stud in bed. These walls are like paper! Nobody has the right to observe my life! Kalt, don't touch his machines... Did she tell you she went on the Chaos Computer Club site, and since then you're on file? She used your code to connect to the Press Agency. What's his password? Love, secret, sex or God? It's always the same! So, you didn't take your eyes off her all night? In America, they'd already have pushed the button. Do you know anything or not? Sakiet Sidi Youssef - 21/12. Mean anything to you? It was on her screen, that's all I saw. Spelling? S.A.K.I.E.T, So, she did use her computer. - What time was that? - Just before you called. For how long? I wasn't in the room. How long have you had cameras in my place? Is there one in the bedroom? The TV! That's why you always flung your clothes over it. Julia, I won't forget this! It was she who trapped you, not me! Sakiet Sidi Youssef. It's symbolic. It makes no sense for her to leave information like that. You're impressed! Never underestimate your adversary. What does Sakiet Sidi Youssef mean? A Tunisian village the French bombarded in the Algerian war. Naturally, the FLN crossed the border! The incident even led to a complaint to the UN! I know what I have to do. I kept up my contacts over there with my old friends. If we were to rely on the guys at Whitehall... - Is that MUX ready yet? - MUX? Pirate Mirage is after a MUX, and we'll get her one. We set it to send a tracking signal the minute it's turned on. It's our only way to get the proof we need! I like you better like this, agent Marianne! It's Zbor. Only he can boobytrap the MUX. That dimwit... He's the dimwit who hacked into the FBI's phone network in 1994 - your government suits released him, remember? Sugar or sweetener in your coffee? Watch out on the way down, you should be prepared. This isn't right! You know the spin? What happened at La Defense is just a coincidence, there's no connection! They must think we're fools! And what was the text this time? It was a voice. How do you know? I read the papers! It wasn't Montparnasse. Maybe Mourad finally got one of his spells, right? How can you pirate a satellite without leaving a trace? Chams, read the papers! It's there in black and white. "A hacker jumps from computer to computer, country to country: New York, Timbuktoo... infiltrating the target network. It's free and almost impossible to track down!" The FBI spent five years trapping Kevin Mitnick and only got him because he was betrayed by a hacker. Can a hacker have his own TV station? Not just anyone! And the goal? Shall we celebrate tonight? Pasta? Yes, for you. I go make good pasta, then you call up at 8 pm and say you're tired, leaving me with the dishes! - We're off to rehearsal. - What did I tell you? Meet "Miss Sexy Chewing-gum!" I'm just in time to share in the secret! Let's go see Kalt? Leave her be. I think she'd prefer to be in her fantasy cyber world. I'll go get Raja. C'mon, leave your cyber-friends! Come and have a drink! Not so loud! You're well on! I was about to join you, I'm dying for a drink! - Gotta live a little! - See, you're living! OK girls, shall we go? Let's go have a Lablabi, and maybe meet Zarga. I'll sneak a bottle and we'll head off... Don't forget the car keys! Where are the others? The doves have flown. They fly off for us to follow. Chams, what you need is a refresher course. You've forgotten how these women operate. I never understood and I don't like it at all. You'd better calm down if you want to keep Kalt! "There are girls in the bars in Carthage. And dreams... in the bars of Carthage." What if I'm caught?! Yeah! Cool down. Wait... No. On the screen, no, just a picture. Spell it. See, it's not so complicated. Hurry up or they'll think I'm a snoop. I have to get a Trojan Horse in there. OK, I got in the back door. "Stopping immigration will take more than a few visas." It's not funny! I have to unlock her encryption files. Shit. This is a decoy! What's that? She's using our own encrypting Routines. And the loggers... Speak English, will you? They're artificial intelligence programmes used to track activity on computers and networks. They record everything and can be connected to an alarm. What? Will an alarm go off? Her system's more sophisticated. Was it a trap? Chams, calm down! I can't do any more, The door is jammed! Julia? Come quick! Prepare the soup for Leila, Malika and their friends. - Hello, Madame Malika! - Hi. - And where is Si Mourad? - He'll be along soon. My brother! Welcome! These are my guests! You're ordering from me and you have the gen before I do! Doesn't look like much! What are you doing with it? You wouldn't believe me! It's like putting a BMW engine into a Mini! - It'll take off! - Exactly! A lot of questions are being asked about you right now. And they've got their eye on that French journalist, too. I'm being watched as well. Mado, your neighbourhood grass says they took out your file. They mentioned an incident with French police. Relax! They can't catch a mirage! You and your proverbs! I'd rather let you know what I know. - You know I'll pay you back. - Stop... HIT & SUNK Watch out, Kalt! These BMWs can be dangerous. It's over between us. I went to look for you. I saw a light on and I went in. When I tried to leave, the door was locked. The door only locks if someone is tinkering with my computer. Kalt, I know I shouldn't have... but I wanted to leave message on your screen... Don't play innocent... It locked because you went too far. Kalt, we have to talk. I need to sleep, I'd rather you leave. Shut the door on your way out! Julia? Shit! You see, it's simple. Shit! Chams! I have to get a Trojan Horse in there. Good, the back door worked. It's not funny! I have to unlock her encryption files. Shit. This is a decoy! Look, it's her! Quick! The camel! Shit! Too late! She went for the bait! Pirate Mirage couldn't resist! Now we're sure! What next? - I'll put her machine out of action... - Proof? She changed her hard disk when she found out. Classic! Let's hope she doesn't check the MUX. Now she knows the hunter! Zbor, I want you to do something. Can you send a text to the Press Agency? They call that hacking, agent Marianne! The chief gave us carte blanche! And to quote a famous French author, Bernanos, "It takes a lot of madmen to make a free nation." So, what do you think of the ending? You have no idea where they are?! They never tell me anything. They come, they go - a bit like my pens. Did you see a pen around here? Thanks. Are we nearly there, Mourad? A few kilometres. Why so quiet, girls? Ready? Wait, wait! Another check point? Yep, another check point. I'm sick of it! The MUX! They stop us. Hello. We're going to the concert to hear Leila Frida. Leila Frida? They just announced her disappearance. Disappearance! Yes, it's not good for the country's image. But, you must be mistaken! She has a rehearsal with my wife who's right here. They want to expel her and now they're looking for her. Come here, please. You found her, what's your problem? - You can't even see the problem! - Calm down! They're going to check us - everything's all right. We're off to a good start... You alone know my Press Agency password! I swear. Haven't you used me enough! There's nothing I can do, Chams, after La Defense, we're under strict orders! You work for the cops! How could I have been so blind? You're the only one who can help. Cut the serenade... We trapped them with your password. - You said it wasn't you! - They're at El Jem. Meet them before it's too late. If not for me, do it for her. Mama, I love you. Qmar. Do you remember Kalt? - OK? - Yes, good. What about the programme? You're on during the first half. After Amina, but before Mokdad. I know. What time is rehearsal? 12 noon. It'll be like Grand Central Station, as usual! - Can I see the dressing rooms? - Sure... The cost of the prank at La Defense is already running into millions of Euros. So we're in control?! No, but we're making progress. Connect to Africa on line! Articles... "The tower blocks at La Defense, home to many multinationals, were down for 12 hours. "It's an exaggeration to call Bedwin Hacker's acts terrorism. It'd take stronger action to weaken the economic clout of this new power." "Bedwin Hacker is attracting the sympathy of a public impervious to the alarmist misinformation orchestrated by intelligence via press conferences after being so humiliated..." "What lies in store for us during the next episode of the Bedwin Hacker saga, the Robin Hood of the new millennium? The same formula appeared over and over again in all the European media. It's true that Bedwin Hacker has become very popular. Some papers are even running opinion polls! The whole world is looking on - I'm not in a joking mood! We have to stop it! It's impossible to stop illegals at the border. You want to build the Maginot Line in thin air? Who's Maginot? "...one foot in the desert, her head in the Cosmos..." Salam? The song, of course I know it, it means hello, and also peace. Chams, not now. Where is she? It's not her, it's impossible, there's no computer. Can you see her? Has she a mobile? You're relentless! I'm looking at her and... If she can plant logic bombs, she can send a signal by using her mobile... Chams? As long as your mobile is on, the sat nav can track you with the chip Pierre installed. Unbelievable! What's all this got to do with me! She's looking at twenty years! - Twenty years? - Yes, twenty! Offences against state security. But you have no proof. What if the broadcasts stopped? But they haven't stopped! We'll find the proof in her machines. So, you found us. I suppose you gave the false info to the press? Thanks a lot! You cost us two hours at the check point! Am Salah loaned me his car. I read your last on-line article, I knew it was yours. I still don't agree with you. To each his own! "... one foot in the desert, and her head in the Cosmos..." We're getting mighty close to the frontier. If the antenna is on the Algerian side we'll never get authorisation to go in. Technology's our solution. The minute you have the position, I take over. Chief, if it's a network we have to take them all out. Why didn't you tell me that earlier? I knew Julia sent you. She didn't "send" me! I wanted to come... I was a bit naive about who she worked for. Are you going to turn me in? You can go, I'm not James Bond! No, but your world isn't my world. Here you need courage. You have to want to resist. Meaning? Everybody has a path to follow. Why? You could drop all this... In two or three months, I'll have my citizenship. If you want, we can... we could... What do you think? Your citizenship?! You think I'd do this for a residence permit?! - You understand nothing! - Calm down! I won't stop! I can scream too! Why don't we both scream! Kalt, they're more powerful than you! They'll always be more powerful! They're closing in on you. You've got to understand! Only when we make love do I feel you... What's that got to do with anything? So you tell me what we're talking about! I'm in the desert talking to some guy who sees nothing. Leave me alone! Did you leave Poly when you were head of your class? Who told you that, Julia? - I know you knew her. - No you know nothing. She used our... relationship to trap me. She offered jail or the DST. With citizenship as the carrot. Did you sleep with her? I suppose you could say we have the same taste! So you left everything? There was nothing to leave. Why should I believe you and not her? Because I'm not asking you for anything! Chams... the mobile. What the hell is he up to? And we were getting close! He's close to an official relay station: Tamerza. We'll see who's the smartest, or we'll take the rap. The others are at the waterfall. You go on and I'll join you later. What are you going to do? You promised you wouldn't betray me. Now's the time to prove it. Hi, Mehdi! I saw the Bedwin site on the net. So many languages! I'm sure they don't know which way to turn! Are you sure you want to go on? Don't you think it's dangerous? Where is Qmar? Kalt, I'm scared. I'm afraid they'll catch us. There's the border - we can always cross over! Yeah, OK. Qmar is waiting for you at home. You stay with the others tonight. There's a guy with them by the name of Chams, don't mention the house in Mides to him. The wind is rising. God protect the transmissions! I told him to cut a lock of Kalt's hair while she slept. What you want is for others to believe your nonsense! In any case, since Kalt started Bedwin, I'm working night and day. We'll end up with our own North African Ariane rocket! Spoon... salt, bottle... We call that CIA Arabic! Maybe, but I still understand everything you say. Don't worry! It's just that your Arabic is a bit precious! Wasn't Kalt supposed to meet us here? Never look for Kalt. I'm not, I just want to check if she's OK. Look, my friend, nobody goes off into the desert in the middle of the night. Kalt will be here in the morning. Shut up, the lot of you! Pass the food! Clap! He who betrays you once will do so again. We'll switch channel 5 to the Tamerza transmitter. If it's lined up, we'll have room to send out the rest. But, I thought we wouldn't need relays with the MUX? Exactly, this is just a diversion! I love you so much, auntie! I mean, Kalt! The antenna! What?! The MUX we boobytrapped is working! Good! We've got her! I'm bringing you down, Bedwin. - I've destroyed her access routes! - Location? I'll alert the police! It's only a relay. Let her go through her usual checks. - Can I count on you? - What's the plan? Want a drink? They're getting close. Tomorrow, we send the message, then delete everything. Malika, wake up! Wake up! Papers! Again! Frida, ID check! Look at them! They're obsessed! Algeria is full of terrorists and I've never seen this! - Your father's name...? - Why? That's Leila Frida, she sang last night at El Jem. So, you sang at El Jem last night? Yes. Amar 1, we found them. If this is about the disappearance... Be quiet, there's no problem! It's just a check. Amar 2, I hear you, we found them. But there's no Kalthoum El Garmadi with them. Kalthoum, went straight back to Tunis from El Jem. It seems she returned to the capital. Instructions? She should contact the local police station. She should go to her local police station. Please? It's for my daughter. She's mad about you! Frida! Tell me where she is, I must speak to her! Please tell me, it's very important. - So early... - Stop it! She's taking a huge risk. And so are we! You always this nervous when you wake up? There's one of you as thick as the other! She hasn't got a chance. Chams is right, we have to get to her and warn her. We said we'd stay put! And Qmar? I want to see my daughter! Chams, follow me, it's over there! Now there's something new! She suddenly remembers she has a daughter! And they're taking the car! She's using relays all right, she must have connections in the region. Where is agent Marianne? She won't be long. It's not exactly the time to rest. Analysing how her last message was encrypted... What's going on? Shit! They've all gone down at once! Calm down... We'd have noticed a nuclear explosion. We had pinpointed the location! It's in the memory of these damn machines! And you're cracking jokes! In 1984, Reagan left on an official tour. Suddenly, the army radars lost sight of his plane and all radio contact. A solar explosion! The unforeseen! A huge spurt of energy like an atomic bomb from the sun! It scrambled all the satellite transmissions. It could also have been a brilliant piece of hacking. One would think you were happy. Hey, I'm really into my job! I got work to do. I have to repair this! Two more programmes and we win the bet. Nothing. A Black Hole. - Did you put up the aerial? - Yeah. The satellite's down. We'll go by backup relays, starting with South Africa. But, the signal will be very weak. The farther away the better. The main thing, is to go through the relays! Who's this? How'd you get here? Direct flight, Paris - Tozeur. How stupid of me. After all, information is your game! Didn't you bring the troops? Where are they, on the roof? I came alone. I didn't want to spoil our reunion. You could have spared me that one! Mektoub... Was it you who cast the evil eye on us? We have a problem, you know computers? A little, but I don't think your computers are down. I'd say the transmission is cut. I needed time to get here and I work with someone who's up to speed. You knocked out the satellite? All that for Bedwin! And then what? I can't do anything without proof. But I'm on to you! What proof? A 10-year old's hardrive? You haven't changed a bit! You'll do anything! Even hide behind a child! You're the unscrupulous one. Don't turn things around. - South Africa. - Speak in Arabic. There's one relay we can get through! Get the programme ready and wait for my signal. So this is the place? It was staring me in the face! We tinker with stuff like a MUX, arrange 24-hour satellite surveillance, mobilise agents, and there it was all along! You're teaching a child this? I'm teaching her to be free! Don't you think that's honourable? Or, should I teach her how to get a visa, residence permit, citizenship? I hadn't thought of that! Next, you'll teach her terrorism! Big words! We merely broadcast something else... But you need a licence for that! We don't want authorisation! Then you're taking risks! Who's this? Kalt, stop. Stop everything. Julia, please, forget what you saw, OK? We'll start all over! You've put me in enough trouble, just let me do what I know best! Right, let's go. Go where? Via South Africa? - So? - She's crazy. Shake off the shackles of sanity and you can live free... "We're not mirages, and you?" Fucking hell! Something went wrong with one of my spells. Kalt, who is that woman? It's a short circuit! It's Julia. Pity you're on the other side! Lift him up, Mourad. Again! What'd he do this time? You could've died! You cut us off from the world, we don't get any news at all! I saved you, isn't that enough! The only person you saved is yourself! Eh, you, it's a charm, good for love. Look chief, we did it, we crashed the lot! Now all you need to do is find someone to parade in front of the cameras! I've got ideas on that one!
