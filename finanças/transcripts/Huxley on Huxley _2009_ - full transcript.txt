(soft piano music) - [Voiceover] Laura Archera, Italian concert violinist, befriended Aldous Huxley, the English intellectual and visionary of the 20th century. And in 1956, became his second wife. Huxley, the literary giant, who wrote Brave New World, found in Laura a woman as passionate and curious about life as himself. This extraordinary match evolved into a loving and powerful union, cut short by Huxley's death in 1963. - [Voiceover] People would think that a different thing was me to live with a famous writer. Would be very neurotic and eccentric, and so on. And it wasn't so. It was the easiest thing to be married to Aldous because he was so gentle. And that made such a lovely, easy, loving marriage. (orchestral music) - [Voiceover] I lived, always, on this hill. I was lucky. I always lived in this kind of simple place from Los Angeles. It is still very natural, not so overcrowded. It was called Hollywoodland at the time. Now it is just called Hollywood. (piano music) I live here about 40 years. Aldous and I moved here when our own house burned. (piano music) I didn't know very much about marriage. I was always interested in what I was doing. I always have had some passion that filled me so completely. - [Voiceover] Good evening. I'm Mike Wallace. Tonight's guest, Aldous Huxley, is a man of letters, as disturbing as he is distinguished. Born in England, now a resident of California, Mr. Huxley has written some of the most electric novels and social criticism of this century. Mr. Huxley, 27 years ago, wrote Brave New World, a novel that predicted that some day, the entire world would live under a frightful dictatorship. He's just finished a series of essays called Enemies of Freedom. Mr. Huxley, I surely thank you for spending this half hour with us. - Thank you. - [Laura] We been here since 1961, and of course little by little things accumulate, so look at all we had that have accumulated. And of course there is book information, and research, because Aldous was interested in everything. And I am interested in every too much. There are the famous 100 books which I never read. I read very little. (laughs) I very slow reader. This is the room, actually was Aldous's room. He worked in here. It was different, of course, but he worked and died here. This is where he died. - [Voiceover] He was very well-known in Italy. But to us children, he looked, I think, in a very different way than the stereotype Aldous Huxley. What struck me most, perhaps, was his kindness, which is completely different from the cynical image of Aldous Huxley that I learned later about in books. - [Voiceover] This is Aldous. From 2nd of August 1962. It was very early in my professional career, and of course I was awed by him and worried, but he was very, very good. And I did four drawings of him. I would never have done four if we hadn't really gotten along well together. - [Piero] Any subject would come up in the conversation. He would know, not just a list of facts, but some very interesting quirks about it. It was like opening an encyclopedia. It's what he called his encyclopedic ignorance. - [Don] I remember Chris visited Aldous in hospital when he was dying. He was working on his essay about Shakespeare. Chris said he was completely absorbed in the article, not at all passive, or idle. So, he and Laura shared that quality. - [Laura] This I do, I don't like to look at television and just sit, so when I look at television, this is really, really good. You don't lose your time sitting on the sofa, or in a chair. It makes it easier to look, to see the news. This is so beautiful. These are ambers. One time, Aldous came from London that time, when he had to go for a lecture. He came back and he said, "I bought you something." And I thought, "Oh, they are so beautiful. "They feel so good." He said, "Yes, they are like angel balls. "You deserve them." So, I just love them. (laughs) (windchimes tinkling) Yes, this is my favorite place in the yard. It's so full of life and so free. And it could be anywhere. We don't know where we are here. Well, of course, if you see that, we do. This wonderful conductor, Antonia Rico, came to Italy and I was asked to give an audition. So, I gave the audition and she said, "You practice two years more. "You have talent. "You have the stuff necessary, " "but just another two years and then you can debut "and come do Carnegie with me." And a woman sing from the orchestra. This was extraordinary. So, my father thought, "Oh my goodness, "to let my child go to America." But, he could not forbid me to come, because he was so pleased with it. When I came to America, it was wonderful those first few months, because in New York, there is so much excitement. People were so kind to me. The evening in Carnegie Hall, just that moment that the bow touched the string, was unforgettable. (violin music) So, when I was in America, by the time I thought I-- See, there was all the war going on, and I was so, so concentrated on this practice on this thing. When I was thinking about everything that was going on, it seemed to me that it was sort of limited to limit myself like that, and I wanted to do something else. From being a specialist, a complete specialist, and then I did everything that came. Then with a friend, with Ginny Pfeiffer, we go to Los Angeles, because she had enough of New York. (jazz music) - [Voiceover] Stranded in America by the war, Laura gave up her concert career and headed for Hollywood, a thriving artistic community of European ex-patriots. Once there, she found a job at RKO Pictures. - Laura and Ginny decided to go in the film industry. And that, from what Laura has told me, turned into a bit of a diasaster. (laughs) - [Laura] I was the assistant cutter for a little while for Androcles and the Lion. It was awful thing that could happen to anyone, to have me as an assistant cutter, because at the time the film had numbers. And I was supposed to keep everything separate, and by number they were given in the end, and then put them all in little box. But all the number were mixed up. (laughs) I didn't work much longer in the studio. - [Voiceover] I didn't think she really wanted to be in the film industry, but she just, you know, it wasn't her calling. - I know that they did a lot of fun things like that, though, sort of like these new ideas for careers that didn't really pan out. - [Piero] I have a few memories. Of course Laura, at that time, was living in America. We were living in Italy. So, we would see her every few years. At that time, Italy was not as Americanized at it is now, so it was really a completely different world. We had this aunt that were living in a different planet. Sometimes when she would come, she would bring something very new and extraordinary, some new ideas, some new gadgets. One year it was her ideas about notation, about she would have all of us kids chew everything that we ate 30 times. Some other time, it was yoga, or Tai Chi. So, she was the extraordinary lady of the family, and also little crazy. There was always a touch of craziness in her. (strong exhalation) - (laughing) That's enough. - I'm amazed by how she imagines things. Her imaginary world. - Oh, look at (music drowns out words) - [Voiceover] It's purple! - It's purple, yes it is. It's really a butterfly now. Look at this. (music drowns out speech) (dance music) Good. This the butterfly dance. I met Aldous in 1948. I had a movie of mine to be shot in Tuscany, in Siena. It's actually the Palio di Siena. It's the one that takes place now. I ask John Houston, "What do you do when you want "to make a movie?" And he said, "You have to get yourself a writer, "a director, and a staff." So, when I heard about this writer who wrote a book about babies in bottles. - [Aldous] Brave New World is a fantastic parable about the dehumanization of human beings. In the negative Utopia described in my story, man has been subordinated to his own inventions. - [Laura] And I heard that he lives in California. And I couldn't find him at first, because I thought he lived in Los Angeles. In fact, he was living in Wrightwood, which isn't far away from here. And I wrote him a letter. And I was very young, I guess, and very anxious, and very impatient, because after three days he had not answered, yet. So, I called up and they said there is no telephone in Wrightwood, only one, and Mr. Huxley comes to the telephone when it's really very urgent. And I said, "Well, it's very urgent." So they got him at his house, and he came running. And he said, "Miss Archera, I just received your letter. "I'm awfully sorry, but I just received it." So, then I said, well, then we made an appointment. I went up there with an old car and I met him and his wife, and became very good friends. We spoke about the film. We even spoke about the music for the film. We had a wonderful day. That was the spirit of these two people. They were such a good listener, such extraordinary relationship that first day that I went and met them. And I never made the film, but I made a wonderful friendship and then a wonderful life with Aldous. I only can say that Maria and I like each other very much. There was certainly a good feeling between us. When Aldous had to go to parties sometimes, she would ask me to drive him, because she wasn't so with it. And she said, "I know that you don't drink. "So, would you go with Aldous?" And I don't drink, but I always took the wrong turn. (piano music) - [Voiceover] In 1955, after 36 years of marriage and raising their son, Matthew, Aldous lost Maria to breast cancer. (piano music) He was with her by her side and guided her to her death, using the rituals described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. - Aldous took Maria, accompanied her on the other side by having her remember this wonderful moment. To guide the mind the certain places which are conducive to your betterment in emotional and spiritual things, too. That's what he did for her and she died very quietly. - [Voiceover] Huxley said, "Maria was more capable "of love and understanding than anyone "I have ever known. "And insofar as I have learned to be human, it is thanks to her." - I was horribly upset at the time Maria died, my aunt. It was traumatic for me. She was a special person. - Part of it was that Maria was a especially dear friend to Chris. I remember when he came home from her funeral, that he was in one of the worst states I've ever known him. He was so crushed by her loss. - [Olivia] So, I met Laura as a friend of Aldous. I think even maybe before Maria had died. So, this was all very pleasant and exciting for me. I was, at that time, staying in the house with Aldous, because he was alone. (slow guitar music) - [Laura] We saw each other. We learned to take walk together. He took me all the always. I saw him in New York, and we became closer and closer. And it was a natural process. So, when he asked me to marry him, I said, well, it seems logical. He liked logic. He liked my logic ever since. - [Voiceover] So, I scratch this out, and write you a letter, my darling. while I drink my coffee in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele. A letter to tell you that you really must be a strega, otherwise, why should I keep falling more and more in love with you. I love you very much and only wish I could love you more and better. Could love you so that you would be well, always, and strong, and happy. So that there would never be that discrepancy between that tragic suffering face and the serenity of the nynph's lovely body, with its little breasts and flat belly, the long legs that I love so tenderly, so violently. Well, I must go to mail my letters and try on my suit, and act the part of a respectable literary gentleman, who doesn't sit in cafes writing love letters, of all people, to his wife. A. - And then, suddenly, there was this scandal in the familiy. Aldous is remarried! And everybody was worried. We found out about it in the news. I think they were married in Las Vegas at a drive-in, or something like this. - [Don] I think all their friends were really quite surprised. And of course it was a little bit tricky, at first, between Chris and Laura, because Chris had been a devoted admirer of Maria Huxley. They were really very close. It was a gradual adjustment, but eventually we were both very fond of Laura. It's difficult for old friends to adjust to a new wife, particularly Aldous's female friends. - [Laura] When I married Aldous, there were several women. Well, of course, why not? He was attractive man. Women were naturally attracted to him. I just happened to be the lucky one. I was quite different from the other women, I think. I was not so careful, you know, such a good housekeeper. - [Don] Laura wasn't the least bit hesitant to assert herself and be at the center of interest. She knew how to be interesting, so that was fine. I think he flourished on Laura's energy. They packed a lot into seven years. - [Laura] Don't see why I get very upset, and things don't go well, and I don't know what it is. So one day, I was in that kind of a mood. And I thought I had to do something about it. I was in my house. Everything was just right and everything outside was just right. Everything inside was just right. I just was not right. And why am I not happy with everything? So, I rush upstairs to Aldous, who was writing, and I said, "Aldous, something is wrong. "I think we must divorce." I did not know that I was going to say that, but I said. And so, he took me into his arm and he said, "Oh, I caught a nymph. "I must let her go." And I said, "No, no, I don't want to go!" (laughs) "I don't want to go. "I just want to go to the trees." I went to the big forest for two or three days, and everything was fine. I just had to go into nature and to quietness. On Saturdays, sometimes, we had very interesting people for lunch. Some well-known and some not well-known. - [Don] There were dinners at the Huxley's with Gerald Heard, certainly, and the Stravinksys. They were close with the Huxleys. I remember Chris and Aldous and Igor deeply engaged in disarray at all. I think Igor was having literary conversations with Chris and Aldous. - I remember one time that Igor Stravinsky came, and he was also familiar with the lady, the cook, Marie le Put, because she had cooked for him, too. And then they went into the kitchen and said, "Maria, I cannot eat your food, "because I am on special diet." So, then he came to the table and he had two things. On one side he had baby food. On the other hand he had whiskey, and that is what he ate all lunch. Whiskey and baby food. And at the end of the luncheon, he was quite tight. (violin music) - There's an open line both to New Dehli and Portland, Maine, if you would care to greet the prime minister and the governor. - Good evening, Prime Minister. It's a long time since we met. - [Voiceover] Laura embarked on a career as a psychotherapist. Aldous, a searing social critic, wrote essays, books, and articles on topics that are still relevant today. - [Voiceover] You see, all that is needed is a candidate who can be coached to look sincere. Why do you consistently attack the advertising agencies? - I think advertisement plays a very necessary role, but what these people are doing is to try to bypass the rational side of man and to appeal directly to these unconscious forces below the surface, so that you are in a way making nonsense of the whole democratic procedure, which is based on conscious choice on rational ground. One has to look at it, of course, from the biological point-of-view. The whole essence of biological life on Earth is a question of balances. This is the force which in general terms, can be called overpopulation. I mean this is one of the tragedies. We can talk about human rights, but to what extent does the word "right" have a meaning to those who just don't ever have enough to eat? All technology, is in itself, morally neutral. These are just powers which can either be used way early, or it's the same thing with atomic energy. We can either use it to blow ourselves up, or we can use it as a substitute for the coal and the oil, which are running out. - [Voiceover] With Aldous's international celebrity came invitations to lecture that took him and Laura around the world. In 1958, they traveled to Brazil, where Huxley spoke on world peace, and warned of the destruction of natural resources, and environmental problems, which he called the crisis in man's destiny. - [Laura] Aldous was invited to Brazil, actually by President Kubitschek, that was president then. And then we took a plane, they took us to the Mato Grosso. Mato Grosso was full of these very primitive people. This naked fellow came to see this man that was very tall and very white. What moved him very much, was that suddenly out of the bush came a man. He looked at Aldous, and it was as though he had seen an apparition. He said, "Huxley, Huxley, Contrapunto. "Huxley, Contrapunto." A wonderful man that couldn't believe that he would meet his idol. And then to meet him in the Mata Grosso was very, very touching. And so the men embraced. It was a wonderful moment. (soft guitar music) Oh, that came from Mexicalia. This one, but now it's so dirty. This is a reproduction of Rembrandt, the Polish Rider. There is a certain feeling of heroism there. Aldous was heroic. Not heroic in the same manner as man on horse, but heroic in his life because why he had many, many wonderful thing happen to him. But also he had very grave thing like being almost blind, and being sort of frail. - [Don] He showed me an art book. I remember him opening the book, to find a particular painting. He had the book right up close to his face, and he would turn the page and again, before he found it. He knew all about the pictures. Amazing to think about him so close to blindness, and yet getting such a charge out of these paintings in the book. - [Laura] With the eyes, he practiced the Bates system. You know, The Art of Seeing, which is a book that really can ameliorate the sight of many people if they do the exercises. And it saved his sight. Although he saw very little, he was not blind. He could travel and do things by himself. He took something that might have been disadvantage and turned it into something creative. - [Voiceover] The Bates System is a controversial technique of eye exercises used to strengthen the vision. - [Laura] Aldous, of course, always practiced to measure the eyes. You can measure youself. And also to do all kinds of exercises. The very famous exercise of palming like that, and it relaxes the eyes. And exercises like this. And turning the eyes like that, and turn just like that. All kind of stuff. (gentle music) These are the books. He wrote 50 books in all. (gentle music) This machine, I cannot do it right now, but it is an invention machine. You put the shoes on and you go all the way up. And you pick up. It's not so easy to do. But it reverses you completely, so that gravity is the thing that straightens out your spine. And that is very good. This about nutrition. I very involved with nutrition about 40 years. This is a really good object. You see, that is one of the object that is perfect. You cannot change a ball. It's perfection itself. I give balls to everybody. And they say, "It's alright, Laura." You should see people that never tried the ball. And they see that the first thing that happen is a smile. I experiment (trails off) And it's hopeless. Very happily hopeless. Ram Dass is my dearest and dearest friend and we had a lot of fun together. We always laughed. He had such a sense of humor. (laughing) - So, we'll visit. You wanna get out? - I'm going to get some lipstick, before I am completely look like a cadaver. These are men with tremendous compassion and tremendous humor. And I met Ram Dass in Copenhagen. That was in 1962. And he was a young man in a black suit. Well the first time that you had a tie, you had a tie at that time, you know? In Copenhagen 1961. And you wore the tie and you seemed serious, but they never believed that you were. - This is Aldous's tie. I was very serious. I was playing the role of a professor. - And I remember, my memory is not always so good, but I just remember because you wear this dark blue suit. And very serious. But then your eyes were not serious at all. They were doing all kind of stuff. And I thought, "Oh, that dark suit is a joke." (laughing) Sometimes, some days, I can play a note. (trumpet music) - Oh, my heart sings. - What made me want to try mescaline, LSD? I never thought what made me. It was a natural thing that Aldous spoke about it. I read the book. It's an exploration. I like exploration. - You've even written about the use of drugs in this life. - Well, this is a very interesting subject. I think it is quite on the card if we may have drugs, which will profoundly change our mental state. But, without doing us any harm. I mean, this is a pharmacological revolution which is taking place. - [Don] Humphrey Osmond, who was a great chemist, told Huxley about the powers of mescaline and gave him some. And then, the experience was reported in Aldous's book, The Doors of Perception. - [Voiceover] You know, we were kicking around band names, and I was in Ray's, our keyboard player's, VW beetle. Jim was in the passenger seat. He turned around and said, "Hey. "How about The Doors?" I said, "The Doors, The Doors. "Well, that's short, you know." And then Ray explained that he got the idea from the Huxley book Doors of Perception. - [Don] When it happened that Aldous was arriving at MIT at just the same time that Timothy Leary was at Harvard, why it wasn't long before they got together. That changed history. It brought on the Psychadelic 60's. - [Voiceover] I found that he was just down the road, Massachusetts Avenue, with real trembling awe, I picked up the phone and called down there. And there was this man that I idolized. I explained to him what we were doing and he said, "Let me get this straight, you chaps "over there at Harvard have authority "to use psychedelic drugs and to research consciousness?" And I said, "Yes sir." He said, "What's your address? "I'm getting a cab and I will be there in five minutes. - [Don] This was a time when the substances were not only legal, but they were respectable. - [Ram] Tim was far out. (laughs) And Aldous would tsk tsk tsk. - [Don] I was with Aldous, and he said, "You know, "Tim is one of the most charismatic "people I know, "but why in God's name "does he have to be such an ass?" - All these crowds come out to hear me lecture. Whenever I go to a college, it's always sold out. It's not because I'm that clever. It's because they gave me the good lines in the show. Turn on, tune in, drop out. - [Voiceover] I knew Tim O'Leary, but yes, Huxley and he disagreed. I am on Aldous's side on that one. I mean, Tim was saying, you know, we should all have LSD every Sunday. I mean, it was a, you know those per closest didn't work out. - Aldous wanted to save these chemicals for use of the learned people. I was in the middle between you and Aldous and Tim, because I ran sessions with flowers. But Tim and Aldous took exception to one another, because Tim wanted to spread the stuff all over society. - Yes, well, he was a public man. Tim was typically a public man. It felt good when you have it. But, you see. - I love that characterization of Tim. - He did. - A public man. - Yes. - Was Aldous a public man? - No, he was a very private man. - [Michael] Aldous, you know, came out of the literary elite of England. He was academic literary royalty, so that gives you a certain freedom to get away with things. - [Laura] It was not something to be distributed like a cocktail. That was difference. It was very, very serious. - [Michael] Laura was my sitter for my first LSD trip. Aldous got the LSD from Sandoz Corporation, and of Hofmann, who discovered it. We actually worked on building plans for Esalen with the architect, trying to conceive some grand architectural scheme. This was the excuse we gave ourselves to take LSD with the Huxleys, and to get work done for Esalen. No work was accomplished. - Laura and Aldous were kind of doing what the '60s did, a little before. - [Laura] In '55, early 1955, yes Aldous asked me if I would guide him, which was really extraordinary, because I didn't know anything about it, you see. But, he was so trustful, I said, "Of course I like to pass a day with you." So, I went to his house, and the house was prepared. There was no interruption, very silent, very quiet. The whole day was really extraordinary, because we were to a level of knowledge. I give you an example for this. He was touching my hair and he was seeing some wonderful color in it, which he would say, "What extraordinary color, what extraordinary color." That's where he was. I was worried because I had put a new rinse in my hair. He wasn't seeing the rinse, he was seeing much, much more than all of that. (piano music) The LSD doesn't do anything at all. The LSD only opens doors that are inside of us. There are hundreds of doors. Sometimes one part of us comes out, and sometimes the other one. Who knows? - [John] I hadn't really heard of Huxley, but I was experimenting with then legal LSD, and treating it very respectfully, like peyote. All the American Indians know it is medicine, and it's dangerous. There's knowledge, but be careful of it. So, all that was going on, and Aldous obviously was doing the same thing, earlier, and being this brilliant, regal literary guy in his tweed suits, and a brilliant writer. He was a mentor, as was Laura. - [Michael] Aldous, as a super celebrity, in the world of the novel, and the essay, and so forth, was a power to legitimate the sort of ideas and practices that became well known at Esalen. So, he was providing language for us to talk about what was then, if you go back to '62, a new world aborning, and was as much as anybody, perhaps more, made well-known hallucinogenic drugs, and then, finally, he opened up all these other ways of growth that did not depend on drugs. - [Voiceover] I only know people that highly respect Huxley. And certainly this whole movement of opening up of consciousness in the west. Huxley is very much at the center of that. - [Laura] Oh, those are all the tapes of very intelligent people, but I listen mostly to the tapes of Aldous. This is a wonderful collection of tapes. It's the one I listen this over again. His voice is so beautiful and so gentle, and I go to sleep. - [Aldous] Man can get more out of himself without necessarily changing himself biologically. It is possible to become ourselves in the fullest ego transcending form. Even in this life, it is a difficult task, but I don't think it's one that is impossible. And anyhow, it certainly is worth trying. - Laura, I would argue, carries on that tradition of non-dogmatic exploration into the human potential. - [Laura] No, I never saw the psychology. I just read and listened to lecture and learn, because just learn by doing it. And then I wrote a book on it, which is called, You Are Not the Target. It was the first book that have this do-it-yourself psychology, and they are called recipes for living and loving. - There are many things that we can do. I mean, I can't go into this this moment, but there are therapeutic methods. In fact, I have seen them practiced. I've seen them at a very close range, because my wife happens to be a psychotherapist and makes use of some of these procedures. - [Michael] Laura was a great, has been always, a great inventor of transformative practices. Her books, You Are Not the Target, was a book that was a bestseller when it came out. So, she has carried on the various lines of work that Aldous helped open up, and then added her own creativity, and also informed his work, I believe, in his last years. - [Nick] I had always pictured Laura Huxley as the goddess. I always felt that the goddess was Huxley's knowledge of this woman that carried the wisdom to be able to know how to bring love into the ground, into life. - [Don] The Genius and the Goddess, well, the title itself is so suggestive. Yes, I don't think that could have escaped Aldous. - [Nick] We arranged a meeting at the Chateau Marmont. When I got there, there must have been a hundred people there. I mean, it was so loud. It was so Hollywood. It was just packed with everybody talking about themselves. I went over to where he was sitting and there was a coffee table between us. I leaned over and I said, "It's a great pleasure to meet you, "to say hello." And she went, and she got up and she came to me, and she said, "Do you think anybody's listening "to each other here?" I said, "No." She said, "That's right. "They're all talking about themselves, "and that's why I don't go to these places very often." (laughs) The goddess would say something like that. - [Voiceover] When Laura started publishing books, You Are Not the Target and her later bestsellers, she was a celebrity in her own right. - [Laura] It came out one year before Aldous died. He was so pleased with it. He was more pleased than I was pleased with it. But he was so pleased, he wrote about it to his friends. (laughs) He was delighted, beyond delighted. Whether you are going to listen to this alone, or with someone else, you will find it a valuable, useful experience. Choose a quiet place where you feel free and comfortable. Loosen your clothes, move around, stretch. Stretch like a cat. Well, in some of them, yes, it does (laughs). Though, it was extraordinary to live with Aldous, because he was doing all the things that he wrote about. The necessity to be aware, the necessity to be loving, the necessity to be forgiving, to be kind. It was always there. You could see it in action, even in small action. Particularly so as he got older, more and more. - Nothing is easier than to formulate high ideals, but few things are more difficult than to discover the means whereby those ideals may be implemented and the critical imperatives that spring from them can be vague. This is the real problem. I mean, one has to dream. One has to dream in a pragmatic way to consider how we can obey the injunctions of our neighbors. - [Laura] Aldous said we never love enough. And Ginny Pfeiffer said easy to love. We are born to love. It's a natural instinct. We don't survive very well without love. But, to love more than we can love, there is the challenge. It was good for the children to have Aldous around, of course, it was very good. It was lovely. It was a lovely period. Two years, not too long. (xylophone) (laughter) Okay. A regret to have children? Well, it's not a very deep regret, but I think that it be an experience that one could have a very good (trails off). I have the experience of babies and children, but not the experience of pregnancy, and breastfeeding. (violin) (speaking in Italian) - Yeah, I like that too. That was good. - I thought molte bene, no? It was good, yes. Now when I'm asked a recipe to keep on going, I think to keep sort of vital and not give in to the years, which are 89 by now. I say, just be with a little child, and that will keep you young. You have no choice. (piano music) So, this story, it's very complicated and very beautiful. And it's really starting, not with me, but it started with Ginny Pfeiffer. - [Karen] Ginny died the year before I was born, I believe. Ginny was the woman that adopted my mother and my uncle. My mother, she didn't really know how to take care of herself very well. She smoked, and she drank, and she was, I think, really depressed. So, Laura ended up going to court, and I became a ward of the court, and they appointed her guardianship. She ended up dying when I was 11. - [Voiceover] Hi, Karen. - [Laura] When she came to stay with me, I was 64, 65, and now she has a little girl that is playing with me. - Can you say hello? - Ram Dass was always really fun when I was growing up, so he was one of the people that I look forward to seeing. - That's nice, isn't it? Take out the pit. - She used to love the rain, and sometimes, we would go out into the rain naked. And dancing, she loves dancing. She was very, she was just kind of an awesome person to be with as a child. (rhythmic speaking) - [Voiceover] She just woke up. - Oh, she just woke up. - Yes, so she's a little uncomfortable, aren't you? - You walk in here, it looks like she's sleeping, I wake her. - Yeah, I'm gonna actually let you do your thing, and I'm gonna feed her dinner. - I didn't prepare anything, but there is a lot of stuff. There's avocado, everything. - Okay, I'll see you later. - There is avocado there. - I know that Aldous died in this house, and Ginny. They both died, in fact, both of them in this room, I believe. (laughs) She put me in the room that everybody died in. I didn't say anything bad about you. - Well, you can! It's your right. - I don't want to say anything bad. - It's your right to say whatever you want about me. It's alright, because I think you have been with me all these years, and we fought quite bit. So, you can tell them about our fights. - I don't need to tell them about our fights. - Okay, then you talk about what? If you talk about me, what do you talk about? - I talked about how loving you are, how supportive you are, and how eccentric and dramatic you are, and that I call you Greta Garbo all the time. (laughter) As I got older, and reading his books, when she talked about him, yeah, It's difficult, I think, to relate to somebody, even if they're your blood, if they die before you're born, as much as family, as if you knew them. But there's so much of him alive still in his books, and just in everything he did, and in Laura, that yeah, I did grow to think of him as my grandfather. - [Laura] Okay, you have enough to do. No, is the artistic thing. I don't want things to be so distorted, particularly a few of them I don't want to be sold, even if the buyer is some kind of a big shot It doesn't mean anything to me, like Island and things like that. Island is this book where this journalist arrives in this primitive island. Primitive, but very sophisticated. This woman gives him LSD. It's a very stiff and conformist English journalist. And I can quote it from the book. The book says all of a sudden, it said, eternity. Eternity is real. You can't believe it. Eternity is a real thing. Is as real as shit, which was very strange thing for Aldous to write, because was not in his vocabulary. - [Voiceover] In his final novel, Island, Huxley created a Utopain free-spirited paradise, the opposite of Brave New World. Island's warning about religious fantaticism, massive military power, and the geo-political importance of oil, were prophetic. - [Laura] In this book he explains and shows that it can be done. Very, just with intelligence and goodwill, not necessary technical thing. Island was actually finish in the house that burned, almost finished. He was working on the last chapter, though, by then. The day of the fire was exactly like a California day right now, with a lot of wind. And naturally, the wind encouraged the fire. It was very beautiful in a way. Very, very beautiful. It was difficult for me to save things, because there was so much beauty. - [Don] I do remember Laura describing leaving the house when the fire was threatening them. She left her Stradivarius violin in a closet right near the front door. She could so easily have just slipped her hand and picked up the Stradivarius from the closet, but she didn't think to do it. - [Laura] I wish I had saved the letter of Aldous. Well, in the last year before our marriage, sometimes he was traveling, and he wrote me almost every day. They were beautiful letters. And they were right there, and I didn't take them. There was something in the fire, and the house was so well-lit, so I forgot to take things. I took just a few just a few things. Aldous' manuscript of the Island, Aldous and I took that, and a few other things. - [Voiceover] The loss of his collected letters, diaries and writings was most devastating. After the blaze, Huxley often said, "I am now a man without a past." - [Don] After the fire, they moved right across the street to Ginny's house, which wasn't affected at all by the fire. That was amazing. - [Laura] We were neighbors before, and then the way that it worked is that Ginny said, 'Well, if you want to stay with me "for while your house get built." We were going rebuild. By the time that I was started with the house, then Aldous died on November 22nd. So, Aldous was here until he died, and then I remained here. Aldous accompanied Maria when she was dying, according to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and so I knew that he wanted the same thing for himself. In fact, he made it so clear, that on the last morning, he was dying and he said to me, "Give me a big piece of paper." And so I did. So he wrote 100 microgram LSD, intramuscular, which was the hero thing that he did. It was a strange day. Because here he was dying, and usually the house is very quiet. And all of a sudden, I heard it in the next room, someone had put on the television. - From Dallas, Texas, the flash apparently official, President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time, 2 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago. - [Laura] And it was so incredible. These two men died the same day, dying in such different circumstances. Two men who did the best for humanity. One dying in such a violent way, and Aldous in the most gentle and the most really enlightened way. After the injection, I ask him, "Do you hear me? "Squeeze my hand." And he squeezed my hand. And so, the second time, he did not squeeze my hand again. And it went on. And Tibetan priest tell you, when you play the music and you go into the end into final pause. It was an extraordinary death. He had that, almost a smile on his face, that I knew very well that smile. (melancholy piano music) There was stories about his death and having LSD, too, because the pain was so intense that he couldn't take it, and that he had an overdose of LSD. Aldous, it's not true, in any case. Finally, I thought this is too much. I'm going to put it all down in writing, and specifically, totally correct. In my book, This Timeless Moment, is absolutely precise, even more precise than I could say now after this many years. - I'm at the stage when I'm giving away my library, but I'm gonna keep about 10, because in my really, really advanced old age, when I retire from writing and just read the books that have inspired me, This Timeless Moment is going to be one of those that I keep, because of the vision it gives of the man who influenced me more than any other that I met, not including Plato, and Socrates, and so on. I just found it inspiring. - [Laura] The process of dying, myself, I don't know what it will be. I think sometimes one can keep one's body well, so that the dying is not really dissolution of the body, but it's just that the body that has burned itself up. It's finished. It has done its work and it goes. I am not worried about the next world. I think that I have had enough experience, have enough proof, to know there is a continuation life. There is even Aldous, who is supposed to be a rose, certainly like (watch drowns out words) You see, I don't see, so I have a watch that tells me what time it is. Because I lose time. I lost time very fast. (piano music) I actually was living history, but when you live history, you don't think that it is history. It is just life, every day life. (piano music) - [Voiceover] Laura Huxley died of cancer on December 13, 2007 at her home in the Hollywood Hills. She was 96. (piano music) - [Laura] Oh, every movement is good. You remember that I told you about the five good things to do. The first one is the hand. Remember, we've spoke about this. Move, moving, water, plant food, love, forgive. And this is oxygen. Will think of some more. So, love, water. (gasps) Ah, the hummingbird. Look, see the hummingbird. They are fast, very feisty little things.
