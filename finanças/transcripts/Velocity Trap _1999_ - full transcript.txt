Federal carriers, once a target of criminal cartels... are now equipped with the Zircon Dominator 36008... Pulse Cannon Turret Gun. Self-targeting. 3600 rounds per second. Fully-automated. The Dominator 36008 has put an end to space piracy. Zircon, bringing peace to a lawless univ—- Zonex. Because life doesn't have to suck. Since the institution of our new electronic monetary laws... our customers are wondering-- Has Discovery Bank changed? The answer is no. Yes, we, like all banks, can now only offer cash services... but we go that extra step and provide security... when you need to move your money. Crime may have killed electronic banking... but service is alive and well at Discovery Bank... with over 360 branches... on 32 planets. Remember the clamps. | got a 400-megaton warhead in my hand. You mind? It's set. Warhead is active. How long? Six minutes. Light the fuse. It's lit. What are you doing? You ever been really scared? - We got less than six minutes. - Fallout, look at me. | want you to answer me honestly. Have you ever been really scared? Yes! Yes, you crazy bitch! I'm scared now! They're still on the rock. Do you want to stop the countdown? We miss this window, we've got 12 hours until the next. Full thrust in four seconds. Detonation in three minutes. It's gonna be close. She's not gonna make it. She'll make it. She always loved a good ride. Detonation in less than-- We're never gonna make this. We're all gonna be fried. - What's that? -Impact in 15... 14,13-- - Fallout? - What? We've landed. If you soiled that suit, you'd better mark it so |I never get in it. You hear me, Fallout? It's on target... but the nav logs will still show it in orbit around Devos 3... that is as long as no pesky probes enter the system. That's why we're hanging around here. - Still have to get by security guns. - Don't worry, Simms. Got an inside track on that one. -You have a nice ride? - Yeah. Good. Because if you two had gotten killed, I'd have been two people short. I'm sorry. We're three months out. Three months to replace anyone. | don't want any mistakes. | expect this from her. But you, Fallout? I'm disappointed. You talk to your crazy wife. Put the gun down. You're not gonna use it. You need me. You're right. | do. - Gotta go to work. - Oh, no. Oh, yeah. Where do you have to go to work, baby? MSP building. The party for the new head of ED? Yeah... and then some. Oh, man! | hear nobody is too happy about him. That's what he said? Who? You know who. What difference does it make? He's a dangerous man. Just be careful, okay? There's a lot to lose with Nelson being in charge. | know, but I can take care of myself. | know how you can take care of yourself, Dana. He doesn't own me. It's a contract. - Then break it. - I can't. You know I can't. | was with you and we had a child together... and I got transferred and you could not wait, could you? Would you listen to me? Something happened, didn't it? When Alicia got sick, | didn't have anyone. She needed a specialist, and you were nine months away on Talos. - I did what I had to do. - I know. I'm sorry, okay? She was my child too. Okay? When [ lost her, | lost you. You didn't lose me, Ray. You could never lose me. Damn. | want you back. Me too. But this is the frontier. You don't break a marriage contract out here. What about us? | only got another two years left... then I can leave and... and we can go Earthside and start over. Two years. | love you, Ray. Just wait for me, please. And colony engineers have no explanation... how he got in the airduct in the first place. In other news, the accusations of corruptions... surrounding the enforcement division and Ramanaya Mining Company... will be brought to a head with an investigation... by new enforcement division chief, Samuel Nelson. As you may remember, the enforcement division... came under fire three months ago... when Officer Ray Stokes accused two ED officers of strong-arm tactics... in relation to purchases of private mining claims by the company. Chief Nelson will be welcomed this evening... at the Museum of Mining and Technology. In other news, two new domes are slated for development-- Remember, registration guarantees freedom. Yeah, we got him. How much for the apple? Twelve plus tax. Twelve dollars. Right. Here you go. Well, thanks. So, what happened? Oh, right. Change of plan. He's comin' in. All right. Listen up. Dawson wants Stokes to take the fall. You got it? Yeah, copy that. You're all clear. Stokes? -Yeah? - Billiard. This is Dunn. Are you working for the company? The company assigned us to keep an eye on things until Nelson got settled in. -How come? -'Cause Nelson gets assigned colonies... that have enforcement division problems. So, sometimes the ED officers, they're just not happy to see him. Well, I'm an ED officer... and I don't have any problems. No hard feelings. Sure. Why don't you take the lounge? Hey, Robinson. I want you to stay close to Chief Nelson. Yes, sir. - You know Stokes? -Sure. - I need you to keep an eye on him. - Stokes? -You sure? - Yeah, we're sure. Now, look... if he gets close to Nelson, | want you to get him out of there. Yes, sir. What do you think? He'll do just fine. Radio check, Gary. Gary, check. All clear. Richard, check. All clear. Stokes, check. All clear. Robinson, check. All clear. - How ya doin'?'? - Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. - Hey, how are you? Good to see you. - Thank you. | expect we're gonna have a lot of unhappy people here... once we start the investigation. Hold it, Stokes. We've got a possible two-niner. Red jacket, on your right. Copy that. We don't know who this guy is. Just stay with Aim. Forget the red jacket. He's clean. Support ED from Saga Services. We've got another problem across the floor. Blue suit. Stokes, blue suit. Stokes, blue suit. We have a "go" on target. I'm pretty happy with the way the investigation's been going. Robinson, stay in your position. - I've got someone moving toward Nelson. - Negative. Stay in your position. Captain Nelson... may I have a picture for our newsletter? Robinson, get Stokes out of there. - But he's not moving. - You heard me! Get him the hell out. - Mind taking it against the window? - No problem. Stokes, you may have a problem with Robinson. Robinson, take Stokes down. Perfect. Sir! Stokes, freeze! Throw the weapon, Stokes. The entire colony is reacting to the news of the death last night... of Enforcement Division Chief Samuel Nelson. Nelson died as the result of an explosive decompression accident... following the failure of a shield window... at the Museum of Mining and Technology. In a bizarre coincidence, Officer Ray Stokes has been arrested... for the shooting death of fellow officer, Franklin Robinson. The shooting occurred during the moments surrounding the death of Chief Nelson... and may be related, However, a spokesman for the enforcement division... when asked about a possible relationship between the two deaths... refused to comment. There were three other deaths and several minor injuries sustained... by the crowd of people present to welcome the new division chief. More tonight in Colony News at-- Looks bad, Ray. Real bad. It's been altered. What's the problem? What are you thinking? You think you're being set up? Of course I've been set up. You know, when people pay for things... they like to think that they belong to them. What are you talking about? You think I don't know what's going on with you and Dana? Huh? Dana was with me on Titan... until I got reassigned. - We had a child together. - I know. I'm the one that had you transferred. Settle down, Ray. Sit back in your seat. You know, I knew Titan could be a lonely place for a single mother. And then, of course, your kid gets the fever. | just want you to know something. Dana came to me... you ungrateful son of a bitch! | spent a small fortune on your kid's medical... and then she goes and dies on me... and Dana was a wreck for the whole first year of our contract! - What about Nelson? - Nelson's death was an accident. Shield window blew. Hey, that could happen to anybody. Nelson had a rep for sticking his nose into things, like somebody else I know. And the both of us know that there are people here running the mines... that got a lot of money invested in things running like they are. So I don't think anybody's gonna look too hard... into a death that's been ruled an accident. - Do you? - And what about Robinson? - An accident too? -That's an interesting story. See, we had an overzealous cop named Ray Stokes... who fired at what he thought was the perpetrator... but he accidentally killed our fine young rookie. | didn't do it, and you know that. No, no, I don't know that. In fact, ballistics... say otherwise. So you see my dilemma? If I put you on trial, it could look bad for the department. But if something happened to you, well... Dana can be a real pain in the ass-- I'm sure you know. So you know what? | got a better idea. What? Relax. I'm reinstating you to active duty with a new assignment... and I'm sending you Earthside. Isn't that what you always wanted? Get out of here. What about Dana? She stays. She's got two years left. When they're up, she's free to go. That's why you're gonna keep your mouth shut, Stokes. Unless, of course, you've got 150,000 to buy out her contract. | didn't think so. I'll be all right. Don't worry about me. | promised you that | would never leave you again. It's not your fault. Let it go, Ray. I'm fine. Are you sure? Handle this for me, will you? Please don't forget about me. | would never forget about you, Dana. That's enough of that. Come on. Come here. Are you crying? You made her cry. Don't worry, Ray. I'll take good care of her while you're gone. I'll be back for her, Dawson. | won't hold my breath. Have a nice flight. Disengage airlock number two. So you must be our security passenger. De La Cruz. Everyone calls me Cruz. Ray Stokes. We've never carried security before. You here to make sure no one gets sticky fingers in the middle of the flight? Special assignment, Cruz. Special? You have to be some special cabron... to stay here for six months while the rest of us sleep. Who do you think's gonna rip off a star cruiser? | have only one question for you, Stokes-- Why are you on board my ship? Nice to meet you too, Captain Fenner. - I asked you a question. - I was assigned to this ship, like you. Really? Could you remove that clip, please? I'm not going to be much help if something happens, sir. "Something happens"? Like what, Stokes? If navigation goes down and we end up hitting a star... your pistol gonna help? I'll tell you what's more likely. You'll be fooling around while we're all in hibernation... and that gun'll go off and put a hole in the side of this ship. Then we're all gonna wake up in a vacuum... with your guts splattered all over the walls. | don't think that's very likely, sir. It's more likely than you needing that gun for anything else. This ship is equipped with three pulse cannon turrets... that don't allow anything within 1,000 meters without an approach code. So you give me that clip! Could I have it, please? Thank you. Cruz, when you've finished showing him the ship... you take him back to the medical lab. What for, sir? To get some lotion for that itchy trigger finger. | read your file, Stokes. The man's like a turd-- Ignore the smell, and don't step on him. - Hello? - Hello. Hi. I'm Ray Stokes. Beth Sheffield, navigator. Nice to meet you. Can I help you with something? - Just looking around. - I'm busy trying to make sure... that I don't put this ship straight on into a sun. Sorry, I just wanted to introduce myself. We are about to travel twelve light years into three star systems... at 25 times the speed of light. I'm impressed. I'm not trying to impress you. I'm merely trying to make a point that I am very busy. Right. It was a pleasure. | met the navigator, and she's as friendly as Fenner. Yeah, but not as hard on the eyes. I'll give her that. You haven't said what monster screw-up got you stationed on this ship. Why do you say that? No one is placed on a federal reserve boat... to watch over a bunch of U-dogs for six months all by themselves. | mean, I'd be bouncing off the walls after a week. I'm a people person. I gotta be rappin'' or I'm sleepin''. You know what I'm ea yin'? | had no choice. There was an accident. My three-year-old nephew has accidents, but that ain't the same thing. So what kind of accident are we talking about? An ED officer got shot. You popped a cop and they stick you on here? Something's not right. | didn't shoot him. It sounds like jailhouse talk. | didn't shoot him. All right. | believe you. Come on. We got work to do. Once we're on the flight, you have to have three codes to enter. Fenner only has one. The other two the reserve has. You see, they don't even trust us, Stokes. What do you think? Forty billion in adjusted dollars. Yo, Stokes, you all right? Oh. Yeah, I'm fine. We started the tour with an empty hold. Thirty banks on 16 planets-- All being brought back to the Federal Reserve for deposit. Could make the most honest man go to the dark side of the law. - The ship is ready for launch. - We gotta go, Stokes. The ship is ready for launch. We're clear. Engage airlock now. This is Federal Carrier 397... requesting final clearance for liftoff. 397, you are clear for launch. Roger. Full power on lift thrusters. You have it. Flight plan into jump zone cleared. Clear gantry and commence liftoff. If you're going to be ill, Mr. Stokes... please use the bag under your seat. I'm fine. Yeah, that's what they all say. We are entering the jump zone. Bring up main generators. - Generators on line. - Nav? Systems activated, ready to jump. Flight plan? 1.6 light years into the Reno system... where we will make a three degree course change-- 5.1 light years into Velocity, where we will-- Do we have the updated nav charts on Velocity? Data loading. Nav charts are tracking 4,233 objects that show all clear of Velocity. | want verification. Come on, Fenner. | just updated. Was I not clear? | want verification. Yes, sir. - What's going on? - Velocity spooks Fenner. - Why? - Friend of his hit an asteroid there. - An asteroid? - The place is full of them. For a starship, Velocity is like the old Bermuda Triangle-- Some ships go in, some don't come out. - How often? - Don't let it spook ya. Odds of an uncharted asteroid gettin'' in our way are 12 million to one... give or take a few hundred thousand. Data verified. Nav coordinates verified eight months ago... by Titan VI survey probe. All right. Activate warp launch cycle. Launch cycle active. Going to light speed... now! Light plus one... two, three, four. Nav systems locked in. Light plus 25.397 and holding. Earth system ETA-- Six months, four days, twelve hours. All right. Let's close up shop and go to bed. Can I help you, Stokes? Oh. No, I'm fine. You're just the last people I'm going to see for the next six months, so-- | see. Well, |, for one, don't find the idea... of some guy jerking off to my memory a turn-on. Now, if you'll excuse me. Strike two. Let me make something clear. I don't want you anywhere near any of the cryo-op systems. Don't worry, Fenner. | won't unplug your chamber. Another last look, Stokes? I'm sorry. | didn't mean it that way. Really? Hey, Beth, what about me? Why don't you just crawl in and be my novia? Sorry, Cruz. | don't do small favors. By the way, Cruz, it's real smart plugging while you cryosleep. If I can't have the best, I'll take the rest. Yeah, that's great. And then wake up... with the playback permanently fried into your brain. | can live with that. Good night. Remember what I said. | thought the captain would be the last one in. Nav is always the last in and first to wake. If the proximity sensors go off, | have to deal with the course changes. What did you think, Stokes? | arranged it this way so you and I could have... a couple extra moments alone before bedtime? Why don't you give me a break? | don't need the last person... that I'm gonna talk to making me feel like a jerk. Hey, Stokes? My name is Ray. Okay, Ray. I was only kidding. Can't you take a joke? Yes, I can. People think I'm very funny, actually. | bet. Good night. Good night. Warning: collision alert. What's going on? Warning: automatic deceleration engaged, Warning: impact in two hours... four minutes, thirty-two seconds. Shit! Proximity alert. Warning: impact in seven minutes. Hey! I thought there was two hours before impact! We now have six minutes and fifty seconds. Dangerous to subject. "Dangerous"? What do you call smashing into an asteroid? Proximity alert. - Warning: impact in four minutes... - Shit. Twenty seconds. Computer, go to voice access. Voice recognition active. The ship needs to change course to avoid impact. Initiate course change. Under Federal Interplanetary Law, any course changes... must be made by a licensed flight officer. They're in hibernation. Please proceed immediately to cryohibernation... and activate waking cycle of a licensed flight officer's chamber. The wake cycle takes 18 minutes... and we're going to crash into something in... three minutes. I am unable to process your request. Please obtain the assistance of a licensed flight officer. Look, process this-- The ship is going to crash into an asteroid in three minutes. Presently, impact Is calculated to be... two minutes, seventeen seconds. Warning: impact in ten seconds... nine, eight.. Seven, Six... five, four, three... two, one. Impact. So where's holding? Thanks, Fenner. We're inside. | really feel like today's gonna be a great day. | hope so. No, the kind of day where you make 40 billion dollars and feel good about it. The nav's only got 25 minutes, and the wake-up cycle is complete. We have to be careful. The flight recorder's still active. If all goes properly, she won't be troubled to wake up and save the ship. But you have to admit it... if you gotta go, slamming into an asteroid... at a half-a-million miles an hour does have a certain appeal to it. - Wake up. - Hey, what are you doing? Come on. We gotta get out of here. -Is the flight over? - No, we have another problem. - Well, how long into the flight are we? - Three months. Come on. Three-- What the hell are you doing? - Hey, listen. - Sick bastard. Listen to me. The proximity alarm went off. Something has docked with the ship. Do you understand? -"Something has docked with the--" What? - Yeah, look. - Okay. - Okay, move. - Come on! - Okay! What? | heard someone. Who? What are you doing? They're all asleep! Nick, one of them's already up. I'm on my way. - What do you think you're doing? - Asleep, huh? Hey, that chamber over there looks empty too. It is now. That's nice. An asteroid less than two hours away... sitting right in the middle of our flight. God, how could that have moved that fast in six months? We're gonna have to change course. What about the ship that boarded us? We're three light years away from the nearest colony. Who could be on board? | don't know. Maybe someone from this system. No, Velocity's a rock. There is no indigenous life. Navigator, this is the Endeavour. We boarded your ship... when we saw that it was on a collision course with an asteroid, We'd like to offer our assistance in any way that we can. They almost killed me getting on board. Endeavour? No, something's not right. What are you talking about? Endeavour was reported missing over a year ago. Okay, look. To dock on to a federal carrier, you need to have an approach code. Without that, the turret guns will just open fire. | need to get my ammunition. It's in the ship's safe in engineering. It's set. You got it, Simms? - Starting to break the code now. - How long? Thirty minutes. How long till impact? One hour, thirty-two minutes. We're cutting it close. | say we blow the doors and get the hell out of here. You're missing the point, Simms. The perfect crime is one in which no one even knows a crime was committed. Those doors get blown, it get picked up in the flight recorder. Remember, plan your work. And work your plan. Yeah, right. Let's go. My guess is that you'd be the navigator... since everyone else is asleep. Well, I'm awake now. So, I assume that... you're gonna be getting right back on your ship... the Endeavour? Right, the Endeavour. Okay. Bye. Say, you haven't activated your emergency flight recorder, have you? - What? - The emergency flight recorder. It's a transponder sent out for late retrieval... in case of mission catastrophe. Yeah, I know what it does. Yes. Yeah, I have. You know something? You're not a very good liar. Drop your weapons. Well, it looks to me like you're outnumbered... so why don't you drop yours, hmm? - I don't think so. - All right. Start shooting. Come on. What are you waiting for? A fl yin the ointment. Isn't this just peachy? Simms, we have an uninvited guest on board. Look, we have got to change course, or this ship's gonna crash. | know. It might be what they're planning. We've got to get to the auxiliary control panel. I'm disabling all flight-control systems throughout the ship... before they access another control panel. Shit! They've completely cut us off. They know we're here. Engineering-- they're there trying to access the backup control systems. Fallout, engineering. You have a little problem with your gun? Like maybe no ammunition? | don't think this guy has any ammo in his gun. Then it shouldn't be a problem taking him out. The gig's up. | know you don't have any ammunition in your gun... So come on out, and let's settle this thing. Are you okay? I'm fine. Warning, bio-control systems activated. - Go! - No, let me finish him! He is finished! Let's go! Bio-control systems-- Move! Five, four.. Three, two, one. Decompression. Come on. Go! Fallout, come in. Uh-oh. It appears our friend Fallout went outside without his jacket. Goddamn it, stupid son of a bitch! He's unavailable right now. What do you say? All work and no play, huh? The code is broken. We have access. What timing, Simms. | love the smell of cash. Don't even think about moving. The terminal's disabled. - Then fix it. -Can't in time to make it worthwhile. We're sort of running out of time. He's right. The whole damn system is shot. There's no way I can get it back up in time. - Then we're gonna take your ship. - Really? And how do you plan to do that? If we don't get off this ship, neither are you. So we'll sit right here until we smash into the asteroid. Mind if I have a seat? What are you doing? I'm just gonna sit here and wait for the asteroid... Sheriff. Where are you? Hey! Sit down. Do you want me to answer? Come on, Simms. I told you it was a right turn to cargo bay. Let's make a deal. And you are? Stokes. Enforcement Division Officer Stokes. Officer Stokes, I assume you're looking for a deal to get off this ship... before it crashes into... 60 million tons of asteroid in... forty-six minutes. A trade. For what? You use your ship thrusters and change your course to avoid the asteroids... then you do whatever you want with the money once we're clear. Now, that's a really interesting offer, Stokes. But, like any good CEO, I need some time to confer with my associates. Oh, and Simms, if you're listening... | don't think Stokes' gun is loaded. | would not do that if I were you. Why? What are you gonna do? Shoot me? We need Simms. He's the ship's engineer. | think we can do without old Mr. Simms. Hey, hey! It's me! It's me! - I thought you were dead. - Program was updated. They've started triggering engineer's chambers as well as the nav's. Computer said something had boarded the ship. You don't know how relieved I was when | realized that they weren't aliens. Bad guys I could deal with... but aliens, they freak me out, man. I'll move it onto the ship. -You don't trust me? - Of course, I trust you. It's that crate with $10 billion in it that I'm worried about. It might make you do something irrational, like... leave without the other 30 billion. They shut the entire ship down. - Give me the gun. - What are you doing? Gonna have to take their ship. And you think that he's a better gunman than I am. We're going to need a navigator. That's right. They must have broken the code. - They're inside the cargo hold. - Hey, Cruz! Are you ready? You know it. How'd they get by the security guns on the ship? How should I know? They're here, aren't they? Where are they? | don't know. The fly in the ointment, eh, Stokes? Sorry, man. | know it's distressing-- Screwed by ED, then this. You know what they say, Stokes-- when it rains, it pours. And, not to mix metaphors, you, my friend, just bit into a shit sandwich. So why don't you call the nav to come on down... and if you two promise not to tell anyone about this little fracas... maybe we'll work something out. Right. Where'd he go? Emergency pressurization pump. | guess you could say "bye-bye" to Mr. Stokes. Next time, make sure your weapon's loaded. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Shit. Shit! Oh, shit! What happened? Where's De La Cruz? What about, " Are you okay? How was your day?" You look fine, really. what happened? Do you want to know who gave them the approach code? That little bastard. You know they have sealed off the airlock in the cargo area? There is no way we can get into their ship from the inside. And-- Oh, we have 22 minutes. Shit. What about the-- the escape shuttle? Powering up the main generators. We're ready for separation in eight minutes. Rolling the last crate in now. - I hope you know how to fly this thing. - How long do we got? Sixteen minutes. -It's been a while. - Here's the deal. You go outside the thousand meters, we don't come back in. | know. Ready? Go. Security guns will fire on any ship closer than a thousand meters. You go outside of it and come back in, we die. What about the approach code? Cruz and Fenner are the only ones that have it. Endeavour, I'm going to crash this shuttle into your main engine... if you don't open your bay doors. Do you copy? Stokes is one resourceful son of a bitch. Pallas. What? You're going to have to get in the shuttle and go deal with Stokes. - What are you talking about? - He's out in one headed towards us. - He's threatening to ram it into us. - This guy's starting to piss me off. - He just blew by my window! - Pallas, you got that? | have a problem with the gantry. - I can't retract it. -Then I suggest you fix it. Pallas, we are running out of time. Cruz, the same message to you. I'm gonna start separation with or without you. It'll tear out the bottom of the ship! Don't start separation until I get it fixed. You hear me, gringo? Yeah, I hear you. If you haven't noticed, I'm a little busy right now. Make yourself a little less busy, and get back on the ship. We've got control damage and we're losing oxygen. We're getting too far away! The security guns! | know, I know! It's nine minutes, and we're still not any closer to getting on board. Damn! Shit! Eight minutes. We have to land now. Okay. Hold on! What do we do now? We're on board. What else do you want? They are pressurizing the bay. - Someone wants us inside. - Inside? We don't know how many people they have left on board. They may not have enough crew left to separate. Ready? On two. One, two. Let's go. Hey! I don't think this is a good idea. Yeah? Well, we don't really have much of a choice. Let me go first. Normally, I'm a calm man, but since you've just gotten my wife killed... | don't know whether to thank you or kill you. Either way, you've been areal pain in my ass. - Go ahead-- kill me. -You're mighty brave. Maybe you two might want to quit your little testosterone contest... and look out the goddamn window! Now, you have a choice-- The two of you can kill each other... or maybe we might have a chance to save our asses! Where are we with power on the mains? 84%. Come on, Stokes. Get with the program. Station three. I'm ready for full thrust on the lifters. How long until separation? How long? Nine seconds! Give me confirmation on release of the docking clamps. | got release... now. Full thrust. Hold on! We're not gonna clear it. Fire the auxiliary boosters. We have fire in the ship! Shock wave impact. Hold on! What do you say? $40 billion. We split it. Split it? So what are you going to do? Shoot me too? Well, why would I do that? Forty billion? But you'd have to be alive to spend it. Back in the pipe. That was a good idea-- returning to Tamara. ED could have easily mistaken this old hulk for a derelict and torpedoed it. | have some unfinished business out there. Well, you certainly have the cash. You ready to go to bed? "Bed"? Hibernation. Okay. Got us wakin'” up ten days out. And then we can decide what we're going to do. With what? Forty billion. - The forty billion. - Oh, come on, Ray. Aside from being a safer choice... going back to Tamara's a much better place to show up... with forty billion and a missing starship. Well, I suppose you're right. Of course I am. - Have a nice sleep. - I don't think so, Stokes. Today the entire Tamara moon and Ramanaya Mining Company... was bought by a private investor. The investor, whose name is presently not being released... wishes to remain anonymous... and spoke through attorney, Mark Ridner, saying he plans to clean up the colony. In an apparent first step, Ramanaya Mining manager, John Dawson, was fired. Dawson, who's been under a cloud of suspicion... since the death of Chief Nelson some 14 months ago... was arrested late today... when new evidence linking him to the death was uncovered. More tonight on Colony News at Six. While the search continues for the missing federal carrier Atlantic... and its $40 billion cargo... a search-and-rescue team announced today the discovery of another missing ship... the Endeavour. Last seen over two years ago, the vessel was found... crash-landed on the far side of Tamara. How it got there, and what became of its crew, remains a mystery.
