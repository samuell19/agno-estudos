-[drumming] -[various birdcalls] [background chatter] [Lumbala] The Mkuru Dam is 5.2 kilometers in length and rises 120 meters above the bed of the Kuru River. Its hydroelectric plants will generate 2.8 million kilowatts, enough to electrify all our villages. At the same time, it will supply our national industries with the power they require to turn our country into a supplier of high-quality manufactured products for the entire world. [journalist 1] Now, Mr. President, how many people will be pushed from their homes by this project? Nobody will be pushed from their homes. We don't treat our people like the Americans did their Indians. The peoples affected are being gradually moved to regions with grazing lands far superior to the ones they have now. [journalist 2] We have heard reports of armed resistance from several of your hill tribes. You've been misinformed. [journalist 3] Or maybe you have, Mr. President. I know of at least one tribe that are mounting an outright rebellion. There are no rebels in Shinkasa. Then why last Friday the 8th were 15 people murdered in the Kuru Valley? [man] What? [man 2] Whereabouts in the Kuru Valley? [camera shutter clicking] [jumbled conversations] Your sources exaggerate. There was an isolated incident between some villagers and soldiers that got out of hand. The responsible are in custody and will be disciplined. This is no isolated incident, Mr. President. This was an army raid against a Kurubu village. -[several people] Army raid? -[Lumbala] Gentlemen, we're talking here of a minor inter-tribal dispute, an unfortunate remnant of the old days. What incident, Mr. President? -Who will be disciplined? -[man] Excuse me, Mr. President! -[journalist 4] Did Colonel-- -[journalist 1] Mr. President! Just who exactly were these tribes? [journalist 5] Who were the tribes involved? Thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen. Unfortunately, we have to end this press conference now. -[general cacophony] -[press secretary] Of course, we look forward to seeing all of you at the President's weekly press briefing next Wednesday. Once again, thank you, and good day. -[shouted questions] -[camera shutter clicking] [journalist 4] Mr. President! Were there any witnesses to the event? [cacophony of voices] What the bloody hell were your men doing out there? First you tell me it was a minor protest, then in the middle of my weekly press conference I find out 15 people have been killed, and that while a reporter is telling me there's a rebellion going on! The President should never be put in that position. Never! Now what is really going on out there? It's as you told them, Mr. President. Goddamn it, Victor, don't hide behind "Mr. President." I want straight talk from you, not some official army gibberish. All right, Inkosi. One of our army patrols went into a Kurubu village. Some nervous sergeant ordered the men to fire. Before it could be stopped, 15 men died. What can I say? It was a most unfortunate action. I did not want to trouble you with it, not with today's press conference. That's not your decision to make. Everything in this country is my concern. Everything. The world bank does not lend seven billion pounds to bloodthirsty despots. We've had peace for six years. This dam will be built, but I will not have the country ruined to do it. I don't understand what worries you. If they find we're killing our own people-- What do you suggest we do? I will not have you out there with the army threatening our own civilians. You'll have to find another way. And do it quickly. I will, Mr. President. [ominous music] [explosions] [chickens clucking] [gunfire] [men shouting] [repeated gunfire and explosions] [women screaming] No! No! [woman screaming] I hate this stinking country. Where the frick is Virelli? [helicopter whirs] [mercenary 2] Rebels ain't got choppers. It's gotta be government. Let's get out of here! [woman] Juanita! [helicopter firing] [firing continues] [helicopter firing] [both yell] [grunting] Are you okay? [coughs] Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Oh! [gunfire and explosions] [gasping] Hey, Virelli. Had you worried you there for a moment, ah, amigos? Aw, I knew it was you all the time. -[indistinct] -[explosion] How would you guys like to get the fuck out of here and make some beaucoup bucks up front, huh? Well, I hope it's for a government this time. [Virelli] I always get you the best. Exotic Africa. And on the right side of the law, for a change. Let's go. [electronic music] Okay, chief, this field's been covered. Some guy, uh, Verini, Vannini, something like that, he called for you. -Virelli? -[controller] Yeah, a goombah. Said your application's been accepted. Whoo-haaa! [joyful shout] [controller] Cliff, what're you doin'? Cliff! Cliff! Ah, come on Cliff. Cliff, are you crazy? Hey, T.J., it's me. Hey, I got a new theme song, man. ♪ Fly me to the moon ♪ ♪ I'm on my way to the stars-- ♪ Will you shut up? Good morning to you, too, sweetheart. [chuckles] You work for the wakeup service, right? Wakeup service? Man, you can't even afford an alarm clock. Yeah. I need a workout, man. You gonna work on that bread you owe me, too? You're on the list somewhere. [chuckles] [Cliff] Well, I think you can just tear that list up, T.J. You know that guy Virelli I was telling you about? -Yeah. -Well, I got myself a real flying job, finally. And I told him I couldn't go anyplace without my valet, you know, so he said, "It's cool, bring him along, always room for one more." So, you're on, man, you are on! I don't know, Cliff. My confrontational skills are a little rusty. Come on, man! Once you get out there it's all gonna come back to you. Or I'm dead, right? Well, look at it this way... you got something better going? I had this one job, worst three years of my life. I'm not talking about the damned army, T.J. Besides, this pays a hell of a lot more money. Wasn't the pay so much as nobody knew what the hell was going on. This job is different, T.J. See, it's very clear cut here. We're fighting on the right side for once. We're like freedom fighters, you know, two sugars. I'm taking about real action, man, not this... not this shit. Hey, babe, coffee's ready. You sayin' my life's shit, man? I don't have to, T. You say it yourself often enough. Look, man, I am talking about excitement. I'm talking about adrenaline rush, I'm talking about... talking about feeling alive again. Man, you are wasting away here, this is, this is, this is... pollution! You say it pays well? Real good. [T.J.] All expenses covered? Covered. No bullshit war? No bullshit. -Africa? -Land of mystery. I've never been to Africa before. Ah, what the hell. T.J. Christian, freedom fighter. [funky electronic music] I thought it would be different. I feel like a tourist. Well, it sure is the tourist capital of the world. [metallic thud] [man] What the hell is that? Stay cool, T.J. [pilot speaking Spanish] [laughter] Hey! You thought I would not arrive. The airplane on the roof? Sure. You knew, man! Hey, look, I'm sorry T.J. I just didn't want to spoil the fun for you. This is Sanchez. T.J. Christian. Pleased to meet you. How you doing, amigo? Okay, as always. My brother, a great pilot. Almost as good as you, Cliff. [Cliff chuckles] So, Shinkasa. What's the problem? Who knows? Pay's good. [Sanchez and Cliff laugh] Captain Virelli, you're late. Your crew? Yes. This is Pardoux, Wichinski, little guy over there is Sanchez. Taylor here is our Topgun flyboy. Mr. Big is T.J. Christian. [car honking] -Hey, whoa! -Stop everything! We're here! Well, the Jeffords should be here, and Baxter, I, uh... Thank you, sir. Anyone home? Well, well. [laughter] Colonel, these are the Jeffords. Hiya, Judge. How they hanging, Virelli? Low and slow, Wilson, low and slow. What the hell happened? Oh, you know, some bartender thought we were drunks so he tried to water down our drinks. Willy threw him out the window. [Virelli] You in all this shit just for that? We was on the third floor. [laughter] Hey, who is muscles over here? [Virelli] T.J. Christian. Taylor brought him in. You all remember Taylor? [Wilson] Yeah, we remember Taylor. Gentlemen, can we get back to business? Where's the equipment, Colonel? Over there in those boxes. Jeffords, check it out. [Mac] Holy shit! Gonna piss off a curator of some museum. Hey, man, you shittin' us or what? [Virelli] Hold off, boys. We'll kill them with our bare hands if you've got the money. Sanchez is the bank. Colonel. I'll have my adjutant show you to your quarters. No, no, that stays with me, thank you very much. Gentlemen, let's boogie. [gags and vomits] Jesus, Wilson. If you're going to take the drive, don't drink. [mocking laugh] Gentlemen, Kurubu territory. Colonel, is that a rebel village? All Kurubu villages are rebel villages. In six months, all that you can see from here north 100 miles will be covered with 40 feet of water. Well, why don't you just flood them out? We can't. The press. Plus, you have the experience in Angola. My men don't. Colonel, bad guys? [Colonel] Yes! Give me that ol' Beretta. [chuckles] [men shouting] Get us out of there before you get us killed, man! [firing] Look at those bastards run! Stay with 'em, my man. [machine gun fire] [Colonel] Don't kill them. They'll lead us to the other rebels. There. Swing it. Swing it! [Jeffords laughs] [machine gun fire] [Wilson] Hey, cool it, Jeffords. Whoa, sorry about that. Come on, let's get the other two. Alive! [Virelli] There they are. Right up their little black asses, boy. Sorry about that, Cliff. [Virelli] Okay, hold it, Wilson, that ain't gonna work. Watch this. Holy shit! Right! [shouts] [Virelli] There they go. Let's go get 'em! [shouting] [background chatter] -[men shout] -[ominous music] That's their camp! [Wilson] Watch this one. He's got an RPG. Where the fuck would he get an RPG? Back up, Wilson. Watch out, Colonel. [man shouting] Let's at least get this last one alive. Is it safe, Colonel? Yes. Had there been more, we would have seen them. All right. Take it down, Ace, take it down. [villagers shouting] Okay, grunt, let's see what you can do. Go in there and get one out alive. We'll cover you from above. All right! Cliff, hit it. [clattering] Never seen a Western before, huh, buddy? Drop it! Turn around, turn around! [woman indistinct] Get outta here. Come on. Get in there! Where the hell have you been? Where'd you think you were at, summer camp? There's a white woman in there. -Where? -In the village. What the hell is this shit? It's the Warwick girl, a nurse. Her dad used to run a mission in these parts. [Virelli] She with the rebels? Claims to be neutral. She better keep her ass out of our way. Take her up, Cliff. [somber music] [emotive music] Kyemba. [camera shutter clicking] Dick, how the hell did you get back in the country? I think those men are too busy killing people here to worry about the borders. Do you think maybe you're carrying this commitment shit a little too far? I see. You're the only one with a right to real commitment. The rest of us are just full of shit, right? [shutter clicks] This happens to be how I make my living. Oh, bullshit, Dick. You could be doing group shots in some Chinese warehouse. Ah yes, wouldn't that be fun. If Kyemba catches you again, he has a very different idea of fun. That's a risk I'm prepared to take. You're a real credit to your profession. [shutter clicks] I'm glad you finally realized that. [Ruth] I'm serious, Dick. If Kyemba finds you here again, you're going to be in a lot of trouble. He'll just kick me out of the country. He can't touch me. I've a British passport. I'm an accredited journalist. [Ruth] So what? You think that's going to make a difference? I hope so. It better. -[shutter clicking] -For your sake, I hope so. Oh, yes. Magnificent. [camera shutter clicking] Jaunde. Kill the Kurubu leader, you cut off the head of the rebel movement. From now on, this is our goal. Well, that's just terrific, Colonel, except we can't go flying in there with choppers. -Captain-- -If he hears us coming, -he's going to bring out-- -Captain! Let me finish. As you can see, there are only three villages in this area. The one we were in today is right here. The tribesman we captured was kind enough to tell us that Jaunde is making his home in this village. Even great warriors such as Jaunde need to sleep, and what I propose is this. Me and my guys go in there and pay a little social call on him. Exactly. [groaning] [grunts] [grunts] Ah! [groans] [groans] [click] [yells] [groaning] [speaking native language] [explosions] [yelling] [groaning] [woman moaning] [firing continues outside] [man screaming] [yelling] [grunting] I want you to tell every man and woman to come out with their weapon in their right hand and their left hand on top of their head. Do you understand? Huh? You tell them. Now! [speaking native language] [villagers murmuring] Get out of there! [Mac] Come on, let's go, let's go. Move on, keep it up, come on. Come on now, come on. Come on down, come on. All right, Colonel, we've cleaned up the area, you can come on in. We're on our way. I think you'll find the operation successful, Colonel. Who let her in? No one let her in here. -Get her out of here! -Go! [Ruth] You bastards! These people are going to die thanks to you and your buddies, tough guy. You better cool it, honey. Come on, kid, let's go. You! Him. Get him out here. You, you, you, you, him, her, you, you. Get 'em out of here! [speaking native language] [camera shutter clicking] [speaking native language] Now comes the retribution part. What do you mean? He's about to show us how big a man he is. Where's Jaunde? [somber music] People, I ask you, where is Jaunde? You're going to be shot. Where is Jaunde? [speaking native language] [groaning and yelling] [firing continues] [villagers scream and cry] Well, kid, that ought to be a conversation starter. Too good for the dirty work, huh? What's the matter, don't you want a piece of the action? Jesus, you guys do nice work. Well, who do you work for? I don't work for anybody. I just happened to be in the neighborhood. Nice neighborhood. Yeah, it was okay, until you guys moved in. [camera shutter clicking] Colonel, I think you've got some company. [speaking native language] Shit. That damned idiot. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Thanks, gentlemen. Get up. Empty. Where's the rest of your film and equipment? It's out of the country. Find his Jeep and bring his equipment to me. [speaking native language] I have a right to be here, Dr. Kyemba. I have accreditation. And I don't have time to play your silly games, Mr. Johannsen. This man is a reporter. You have no right to treat him like that. Ruth, stay out of this. The man is right, go back to your place, Miss Warwick. Kyemba, I'm warning you! There are witnesses here. [Colonel] What! You're warning me? Please, show Mr. Johannsen to his Jeep. [unsettling music] [sobbing] [Johannsen groans] Witnesses? What witnesses? You're the only witness I see. You bastard. [Colonel] The man was trespassing. Were these people trespassing? Yes! Like Johannsen, they had been repeatedly warned. And if you really want to help these people, I demand that you tell me where I can find Jaunde. Fuck you! I'm not joking. I demand you tell me. [villagers gasp] [Ruth cries out] That is one nasty dude. [everyone gasps] [murmuring] [T.J.] Drop it now, shitface. Drop it. Drop it. I'd say you bagged your limit today, Colonel. Now get out of here. D'you think you're any better? I'm just trying to save your life! [Colonel] You and your men came very close to being shot today, Mr. Virelli. That action today was inexcusable. -[click] -Totally unprofessional. Well, now, Colonel, that grunt was out of line, for sure. But realize something... when your boys start pointing guns at my boys, we don't smile back. If that ever happens again, Mr. Virelli... [repeated clicks] ...I'll kill you. [click] You have your drink now. Let's get back to our enemy. I've known Jaunde since we were in school together, and as you can tell, we've chosen different paths. Still, one must realize behind that simple tribal costume lies a very cunning man. This village... This village is the last one in this part of the valley. He's either here or in the hills near their ancestral burial ground. If he is here, it will be extremely difficult to find him. We have found a Kurubu scout in the army that's familiar with the terrain. He is now on the train to Hokko station. He'll arrive at seven tomorrow morning. We are very lucky to get him. Why's that? [Colonel] Most of my army is Mbante, my own lineage. We are the dominant tribe over Shinkasa. The Kurubu are bush dogs. Bush dogs? Bush dogs. Well, I don't care what kind of animal he is, Colonel, as long as he helps me nail the guy. I'll have a chopper pick him up in the morning. [Cliff] Put that red clip back again. All right. That got it? No. But, uh... Tell you what, I got an idea. I'm going to get some more tools from my cab. -I'll be back in a minute. -All right. How's it going? Hanging in there. What seems to be the problem? Well, I seem to have a shot-- [grunts] I don't care. Listen up, dick brain. [T.J. panting] Let me make something straight with you. Don't you ever come between me and the money like you did today. He's the paycheck, and next to that, you ain't shit, you understand? Number two: I don't like the gash. She's trouble. I don't want to see you sniffing around her again. You copy? Number three: Your attitude sucks! You don't like the job, get the hell out before somebody buys it when you fuck up! Are you through? I better be. Taylor, you better straighten things out with dick brains over there. I don't want to warn him twice. Meet me in my room in an hour. I've got a job for you to do tomorrow morning. [indistinct yells] [speaking native language] [Cliff] Hey, what's he saying? [sergeant] That the whole trip has been bloody tiring. Oh, well, life's a bitch. Uh, let's go. What? These are donated materials from the Red Cross. Forget about it, T.J. No, it's okay. Okay, look, take him over to the chopper and wait for me there. I'll be back, okay? Take him over. [Ruth] I mean, what the hell is going on here? This never happened before. It's simple. You owe a ton of money. [T.J.] Howdy, ma'am. Problem? Just a little misunderstanding. Uh, these supplies have always been prepaid, now this guy's trying to tell me something that-- What the hell is going on here? Ah-ah-ah. I just want to take a look at these, ma'am. I'm looking, but I don't see any charges here. You see any charges, Cliff? No, these don't look like charges to me, how about you? There and here. Take another look. [policeman] Yes, sir, you are right. Some shipping clerk has made an error. Now why don't you be a gentlemen and help the little lady load up? Show there's no hard feelings, amigo. I'd be most honored. Much obliged. You sidewinders think you're real tough, huh? Real desperados. You're welcome anytime, ma'am. You're a real jerk, you know that? [laughing] Sergeant Obunte's work has borne valuable fruit. Jaunde has gathered all of his tribesman outside his village for a futile last stand. Tomorrow we will attack the perimeters of this sacred village and bury the last of the Kurubu chiefs. Captain Virelli will give you your specific assignments. Thank you, gentlemen. [door closes] It's a pretty standard op, guys, pretty standard. We've got some good roads back here, but there's a few switchbacks that could bottle us up. Why should we assume that Jaunde's men will stay around the village? Tomorrow they could be anywhere. [Virelli] But they won't be, Pardoux. The Kurubu are not normal fighters. From what Kyemba and Obunte tells us, they always fight with their backs to the villages. That's the way they do it. And from what Obunte hears, that's what their goal is, to defend their most sacred village. Without that, they don't have a tribal land. This sounds like bullshit to me. Well, that's because you're a cracker, not a Kurubu, Jeffords. [Cliff laughs] Now, we'll all be coming in here from the west. Kyemba's men will take two columns, we'll take the wings. That's it, guys. Our op starts in 18 hours and 13 minutes, exactly. Get yourselves a little R and R. -[helicopter whirs] -But before you get yourselves too whacked out, I want you to offload that incoming chopper. It's just some special equipment. Do the job. [indistinct chatter] -Hey! -Yeah! [laughing and cheering] Now, boys, compliments of the judge. -The judge! -Thank you. Hey, man, there ain't no way those six broads are going to take on this whole camp. Wilson, if Kyemba wants to buy his own hookers, he pays for 'em. These are yours. Oh, yeah? Well, what's going on over there? [women murmuring] I'll find out. Ladies, what seems to be the problem? They stink. -That's right. -But I'll go. Okay. You guys stink. [laughter] Bath, or no ass. Baths? Hit the river. [laughter] [woman] All right. ♪ On a Saturday night ♪ [laughing] [laughter] Yeehaw! [women giggling] Well, go to it, man. No, I'm not that desperate yet. I've only been here four days. Bullshit, you've got the hots for that nurse. Oh, yeah? I think you've got the hots for that little lovely -on the beach there. -[Cliff] No, no, no. See, I'm like a boxer, you know? No action before the big fight. I don't want to sap my vital juices. Yeah, well, she sure looks like she'd do that. Yeah, and I sure don't want to do that, do I? [T.J. laughs] [T.J. panting] So, you've seen mine, now let me see yours. Haven't you seen enough already? Not of what I want. Hey, what are you doing here, anyway? Ah, well, I thought about it. You guys really helped at the station. You probably want to get back to your friends over there. I'd better leave. Back to the Kurubu rebels? The Kurubu aren't rebels, and somebody has to be working for them. Well, those guys don't think that way. [Ruth] All they see is what's in front of their guns. Well, they think you're a sympathizer. A crew of trained killers come in here with a whole bunch of rockets and machine guns and stuff. Who would you have sympathy with? Look, we're just doing our job. All they've got to do is move. That's bullshit, and you know it. Hey, that's the way it is. [Ruth] What do you mean, "That's the way it is"? You're coming in here killing a bunch of people who have every right to be here. Well, where're you goin'? Back to the Kurubu to be with the normal people. Hey, why don't you stay here? I can be normal. Why don't you come with me? Nah, I've already seen them. You've seen dead ones. Wait a minute, you want to take me to a rebel village? Don't worry. I'll protect you. Look, if you go back there, you're going to have to come back to me for a cure. I might not give it to you. You think that's going to protect you? Maybe not, but it sure makes me feel better. [engine ignites] [women chanting] [Ruth] Well, this is what Kyemba wants to destroy. Looks dangerous, doesn't it? What is it? It's a puberty ceremony to initiate girls into adulthood. How can they do this after what happened the other day? These girls have been preparing for a whole year. Should they stop their lives now? In the olden days, the elder women would break the young girl's hymen with a special phallus. Don't worry, they don't that anymore. Nowadays, they only draw a little symbolic blood. It's too bad about this place. What do you mean? In a little while it's going to be flooded. Kyemba gave them a chance, now he's got to make his move. This is going to last for another five hours. Come on. This is the spot where all the Kurubu chiefs are buried. It's not like our cemeteries, though. The Kurubu rarely come here, only at the time of great transitions, you know, like the birth of a chief, the death of a chief. [unsettling music] [speaking native language] He says he doesn't want to harm you. He only wanted to meet one of the white fighters. [continues in native language] [chuckles] He says you're strong warriors, and you've earned the respect of the Kurubu. You fight like the Kurubu, almost like gorillas, but he's confused about something. Why do you allow the Kurubu women and children to be killed? Is it a tradition of the white warriors? [speaking native language] He wants to know if you're going to bring women and children along next time you attack them, so they can kill some of yours. [laughs] [speaking native language] He says you're too serious. [warrior chuckles] [speaking native language] What did you say? Well, I said I didn't think you were too serious, just very confused. I'm not confused. [warrior continues speaking] He says that I'm unfair to you. He says you're a strong warrior, and if he had money he would pay you to fight. He wants to know if you wouldn't maybe take a couple of cows. [chuckles] [speaking native language] [laughs] [Ruth] Impressed? [chuckles] Books, radio... You've even got running water. Just like home. Of course it's home. Yeah, I guess it is. How long have you been here? Two years. I've been in the valley seven. Is this a picture of your mom? No, my aunt. Say, was this taken around here? Yeah, things don't change much, do they? I took that the first day I got here. You don't mind me snooping around, do you? No. I've got nothing to hide. Where are they? They're gone. -Back to the States? -No. They were murdered. Aw, damn, sorry. Someone around here? A tribesman? Tribesman! [T.J.] Well, I don't know. Who? There was a bloody revolution in Shinkasa. I wouldn't expect you to know. No, I just got here. I don't know. Well, then don't ask me about me my aunt! Well, this time I want to know. Which part? The murder? The government harassment? Maybe you'd like to hear about the rapes, huh? Forget it, I'm sorry! Sorry I pushed it so hard. [Ruth] Maybe I want to talk about it now. What you're doing for Kyemba, I've seen it all before. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, you should, because you're part of it! And it was exactly the same goddamn thing when those soldiers drove up to the infirmary. And they were drunken and they were laughing. And when my aunt and the two nurses didn't want to laugh, they poured liquor down their throats. And when they still didn't want to laugh, they raped them... and then they raped them again with bayonets. Okay, that's enough. That wasn't enough. Then they mutilated them. [sobbing] And their blood started dripping down on me. I was hiding in the medicine cooler, underneath the floor, and their blood started dripping down on me and I couldn't stop it because there was a rifle there and I couldn't... [sobs] Shh, stop it. Come on. Come here. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. Come on. See? You didn't need the gun. You always need it out here. Yeah, maybe you do. Listen, that story I told... I'm sorry I dumped that on you. I'm not. I've got to go. Back to that village? Which one? The one we were at today? Yeah. Eventually. I mean tonight, tomorrow morning? Tonight, no. I've got to see people in another village tonight. You're going there tomorrow morning, then? Mm, I don't know. But if you do, it probably won't be until tomorrow afternoon, right? [Ruth] Yeah. Hope to see you soon. Yeah. [engine starts] Good evening. [indistinct murmurs] [80s electronic music] [tense music] Yo, Taylor, checking in. We're on time here. Did that other stuff get in yet? Right on time! Roger that. [suspenseful music] -[click] -[men yelling] [indistinct yells] [gunshots] [yells] [man yells] [men yelling] Watch that coming in! Taylor, do you copy? We are not inside the village. We are outside the belt. Two clicks, Taylor. [T.J.] Sanchez is down! Go! [yells] Shakutela, get the Warwick girl, she's in the village, and bring her to the base camp. -Right, Colonel. -Now! [groans] [speaking native language] Go! [dramatic music] [men yelling] He's dead. Let's go! [Virelli] Wichinski! T.J.! [Virelli] He's had it. Let's go! [yells] [speaking native language] [groans] [blows horn] Shit! I'd like to know how the hell they knew we were coming. Yeah. You think T.J. could've told them? Yeah. He's in with the gash. With the nurse. Yeah, makes sense now. I'll report him. I'll find that out. Fuck it. It's too late now. [panting] [crowing] [ominous music] [speaking native language] [singing in native language] [song ends] So, we meet again, Mr. Christian. You speak English, Jaunde. [Jaunde] Not too often. I haven't long to live now. That ambush... You knew we were coming. Ruth... She must've told you. We knew you were coming. She only confirmed the time. We have an expression in our language, and it says, "No man for certain knows which way the wind will blow." Obunte. He was working for you. [Jaunde] He's a Kurubu. We never had a chance. [Jaunde] Our victory was not a great one. We lost too many men, thanks to you, your friends... and to this, a devastating weapon. We don't fight for money, we fight for survival. Kyemba will massacre the entire Kurubu. Why do you think that is? The Kurubus support Lumbala because he is a just man. Without the Kurubu support, Kyemba would take the power from Lumbala. You're committing a genocide on people you don't know, for somebody you don't know anything about. Does that make you feel good, Mr. Christian? -[speaking native language] -[villagers reply] Our fight must go on, Mr. Christian. Leave this valley and take your mercenary friends with you. First, I've got to talk to Ruth. She's got to understand. [Jaunde] Go while you still have the chance. -[speaking native language] -[villagers reply] [singing in native language] -Hey, wait a minute! -[villagers stop singing] I don't want to be your leader. I don't want to be your chief. I can't be your leader... I just want to go home. Oh, shit! -Come on. -[uplifting music] What's the story with her? She's got nothing to tell us. Hey, Sergeant! Bring that girl over here. Hey, you heard the man, asshole. Bring her over here. [speaking native language] [imitating native language] [laughing] A rebel and a foreigner. I don't think she's got much of a chance. Fuck this. I'm going to find out if this job's over. I've got a house payment to make. Anything else, sir? [knocking on door] Yes, come in. What do you want now, Captain? I want to know what the hell is going on, Colonel. Am I still working for you? Or do I find myself a new employer? After this job, you're going to have a lot of trouble finding another one. No, Colonel, there's plenty of demand for my services out there. As a matter of fact, -you need me right now. -What do you mean? Oh, I'm not fucking blind, Colonel. You're after the big seat in Shinkasa. And you need my help. You're very crude, Captain. You're also very perceptive. You're telling me you're scheduled for another job? Money talks, Colonel. [soft drumming] Look at this. Come on, man. Go. [speaking native language] Hey, you going somewhere, bro? Yeah. You stealing this chopper? No, I'm just borrowing it for a while. Leaving us to do the dirty work. This place stinks. This job stinks. You stink. Pardoux, Zyn, Chas, they stink, too? Ah, leave him alone, Mac. She's just pining away for her little boyfriend.... [tense music] Time to rock and roll, motherfucker! [groans] You son of a bitch... [T.J.] Having trouble, Cliff? Drop it, assholes. Now! You little fuck! Come back for your boyfriend? [T.J.] Back off, both of you! Back off now! [tense music] You've got shit for brains, T. J. [T.J.] Back off, now, back off! Just leave 'em there, T. Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's do it, man! Watch my back! [shouts] [choking] Forget it, man. He's dead. What the fuck is going on here? What the fuck do you think is going on, man? They just stole a helicopter. Yeah, ol' Cliff and Musclehead took off. -T. J.? -[Mac] Yeah! How the hell did he get here? How the hell do I know? [Virelli] Well, who did Wichinski? Your man Taylor did Wichinski! I never did like these men. I hope your new crew is better. New crew? Yeah, we've got to talk, boys, in the barracks. [adventure music] You all right, man? Thanks, thanks. No problem. I owed you one, anyway. So where are we going now? Back to the Kurubu. I've got to find Ruth. Ruth? Ruth is back there. Where? The camp? She's in the chopper shed. Kyemba's men have her. Hey, turn this sucker around. We've got to go back. You've got to be crazy. What's the matter with you? Turn it around, Cliff. Kyemba's nuts! He'll kill her! We're on the wrong side, man. -All right, let's do it! -Do it! [heroic music] What's the crap about new men? Hold it. You know... [speaks native language] Okay, boys, here's the story. If you've had enough, you can cut now. I understand. Or you can throw in with Kyemba, and really clean up. Now, Kyemba's no fool, and he's willing to pay the price to get what he wants. And you know what he wants. He wants the big seat, in Shinkasa. Hey, man, have you noticed that there's only three of us left? [Virelli] I can get who I need, that's my job. I'm making you guys an offer. Take it or leave it. [helicopter approaching] Little brother, I say we're in. Ah, shit. Okay. [Virelli] I got some organizing to do. [panicked shouting] [machine gun fire] Let's get the hell out of here, now. Want to stay here and wait? -[machine gun fire] -[coughing] Mac, look out! Mac! [screaming] Mac! Mac, Mac! Mac! [gunfire continues] Mac! [suspenseful music] Hey, man, you just killed my brother. Back off, Wilson. You're a traitor, man. Let's go! [heavy gunfire continues] [shouting in native language] [screaming] Virelli! Virelli! [tense music] You fucked things up real good, Mr. Christian. But you gotta learn something: you don't fuck with the judge! [T.J.] Let her go, Virelli. Let her go. Don't be an asshole, Christian. This has got a two gram hair trigger, you got it? Now, Kyemba's my blank check. I want him out. You get him out, you get the slut. [epic adventure music] Chipo, start the chopper. [screams] Kyemba, look out! You traitor! [groans] C'mon, let's go, move! [helicopter taking off] You know, we used to say in Viet Nam he had nine lives. This time it looks like he used them all up. You know, for a minute, I thought they was gonna throw us in a hole and pave it over. Come on, you saved Shinkasa from a bloody coup. Yeah, well, Bill's not going to be shooting his mouth off about that. Yeah, well, we're not out of it yet. Where is that guy? This is one train I don't want to miss. Here you are, gentlemen. Your papers are in order. Naturally, you are not welcome again. Don't worry about that. Bye-bye. [chuckling] Yeah, um... I guess it's time to go. Gonna go find another war? Hell, no. War's not our thing, right, T. J.? [T.J.] Never again. -Bye. -[Ruth] Goodbye. [T.J.] Will you come back? Sure, I'll be home by Thanksgiving. Listen, why don't you just buy me a beer in LA when you get back? Yeah. I'll do that. [train horn] Gotta go. [soft music] Take care, T. J. [soft music continues] [music ends] [military music]
