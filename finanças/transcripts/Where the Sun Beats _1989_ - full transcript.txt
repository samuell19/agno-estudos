WHERE THE SUN BEATS Before she went out in the evening, she would kiss me. As soon as I heard the door close, I would rush to her room. Laura kept a diary with letters and photos. I could hardly read, so I became furious because I couldn't understand the words. I would slip into her bed. When I heard her coming, I would close my eyes as if sleeping. She would come to bed carefully, not to wake me up. Then I grew up and found new friends. I never told her about this. - Had a good trip? - Yes I did. - Give me that. - It's all right. God, this heat! How's Laura? Is she bearing up? She's better now. She's started working again. But don't mention the kid. Don't worry. Do you recognize the road? We'll see the hills in a minute. Next time I'll know that myself. To change the subject - how are your classes going? I don't know if I've got the marks for the medicine course. I've spoken to a friend of mine to see if he can work something out. Maybe with one of those temporary agencies. But that's got no guarantees, particularly for the future. Well, yes, that's a problem, but we'll see. But not in your case. What's different about me then? You're well prepared. But if you don't get in, we'll talk about you getting a job again. I don't want to impose on you. Don't worry about it... Besides, you can make it up to us. How? Don't let your sister know you've thought about stopping studying. Tonight the teacher and her husband are coming for dinner. They want to meet you. Perhaps they will bring their daughter with them. Did you have a good trip? Yes. Laura, show him his room. Aren't you happy to see me here? Don't talk rubbish... How are things then? It's only just getting organized, you can't imagine how little space there is... Is it a lot of work? Some. And what about the rest? What rest? Don't treat me like a child. Everything I love is here. Everything? What about me? You, you're the person I love. Your bed's here. See you in a while then? Nuno! How are you? Are you fit? I thought you'd never show up again! Well, I came this time. You only just caught me. I was going out. Where are you going? To my granddad's farm. It was in a bad way. How do you manage? I get by. You'll have to take a look. See the sheep... Try my cheese... Are you making cheese now? More headaches than you can imagine. Francisco, Nuno, let's have lunch. - Hello, father. - How are you? Your tractor's ready. Next time Alberto can fix it on his own. Aren't you staying for lunch? I have to be going. The vet's coming round. I want to be there. Go on then. Don't be late. Look after my room, Nuno. Just ignore the rubbish... It doesn't matter. Ciao. Don't look now! What a pretty sight! Have you realized that at 18 you can do whatever you want... I don't want to do anything different from what I'm doing now. I don't think you've changed so much time's stood still. But I'm older now... People generally keep the memories of their most important experiences. I can't see that in your face. But I don't notice anything special about you. Are you sure? Sit where ever you like. What beautiful china. It's in your honor! Sit down. Don't wait. Are you still thinking about medicine? Yes. And have you thought about a speciality yet? It's still early. Take advantage of your stay to have a rest. I know you've had good marks. That's rare nowadays. They hardly study. That's what all teachers say... Don't joke, experience has taught me that despite all the reforms they've made pupils don't have any more general culture, they're not better prepared for professional life, and they don't even have the slightest idea about something as simple as national identity. Your language surprises me sometimes. What do you mean by national identity? Well, for me it's a special way of being in this great world we live in. And what is this great world we live in? It's all that news we get from the radio and newspapers. I read something amazing just yesterday. A statistic that said the majority of history students, history mind you, don't know who the last king of Portugal was. The past is the soul of a people, it's their culture. That's normal. Young people are interested in the present. You're wrong, Laura. Go and as them who the Minister of Home Affairs is... They don't know. Yes! How often do I lend my newspaper to my pupils? And books? I still remember Francisco, as a little lad, clutching the "Story of the Fox". Now they don't even pick up a book. And what do you think does interest us? Today something that seems superficial might be very profound. Yes, but people worried about the future. They made plans. I understand why they don't think about the future. You can't generalize. There are people and circumstances that make every case special. And what now... my case? That trip? Ah! If you like travel I can lend you a Serpa Pinto book. It's full of amusing adventures. And it's very educational. Gra?a just adored that book. Oh Nuno, you haven't met my daughter yet, have you? She is a friend of Francisco... Whenever I went to milk the sheep, everyone was still asleep. To tote up accounts is no real work to me. Mr. Artur was the only one to get up before sunrise. Good morning... Have you eaten? Yes, Lucia gave me breakfast. I'd like to go for a walk with you but I can't leave this. Do you want a hand? No. Go for a walk... You're in charge! Alberto! This is my brother Nuno. Show him round the farm. - Hello. - Hello. If you've got things to do you can go. It's all right. My sister's worried about me. What do you want to see? It doesn't matter. I hardly know the farm. My house is over there. Down there is the dam. Are you going to the game later? Maybe. We're counting on you! I don't know, we'll see. Where is the game? Over there... What's that? Potatoes, they all went rotten because of the rain. I heard the bad weather ruined everything. Have you been working here long? Long enough. I didn't see you when my sister got married... I don't usually go to those things. But do you like this? I don't know anything else. What do you do on the farm? What do I do?... Whatever they tell me to. Would you prefer to be with Francisco? It's all the same. What do you mean? I go wherever I'm needed... Did you hurt yourself? No, it's nothing. Let me see. Don't move. Don't laugh. This doesn't hurt. That's where they buried your nephew. The coffin was this big. I couldn't come. I had classes. This is nicer than I thought... You see that house over there? It's abandoned... That's where I usually go. Who with? With the sheep... On my own. But people don't like to be alone... What does that matter? What matters is what I think's right. Well, I'm a bit tired. It was the fall. I'll be going then. You stay. I'm on your payroll. I'll go with you. No, stay here! I know the way now. Where've you been? Nothing to do with you! You said you were going with me! I've already had enough smell of sheep. I washed myself all over today! Can't you leave that? Just a minute. You're starting to look like mother. Do you still remember her? And when you ran away from home, do you remember? I was just beginning the first class... We looked all over for you. You never said... The next day I went out of school, went down the steps and stood by the door to see if anything would happen. And then what? Nothing... They found me and took me back to school. My wandering didn't last long either. It didn't last long... So what did you think of the farm? It's bigger than I thought. We went up to the top of the hill. They must be fed up with working, him and Artur. Artur should rest a bit. People should do what they think's right. What about Alberto? I didn't understand him very well. He's a quiet one but you can count on him. He started work very young. What about his parents? We don't know much. His father's abroad. There are some strange stories... about him... So, what did you talk about, anyhow? Loads of things. He explained the crops to me... Virtually everything they do on the farm... He spoke more than usual. He does what they tell him... because bosses... are bosses... Oh really? Why do you think I couldn't go with you? I've been here for hours and I still haven't got the books right. Are you going to go bankrupt? Don't joke... want to see how things are to see if I can pay for your trip or not. Do you suppose not? We'll see. Have you seen the train schedule? There is only one in the evening. Why don't you go for a walk? What happened to you? I slipped, it doesn't matter. Can I play? That one, I knew him well. He came over for his sister's wedding. I saw them talking by the dam that same morning. Got himself drunk and fell asleep in a corner. When he woke up, Mr. Artur and the lady were already gone. He broke glasses all over the place. Next day we had to dean it all. Aren't we going to have a drink or something then? I can't. I've got to catch the train. What's the quickest way? Go along here, down there, then go up. Have a good trip. Father, what brings you here? I passed by. Couldn't help seeing you. How nice. Sit down. Have a drink. Just a drop to keep you company. What about your cold? Just a bit of fever. Have a cup of wine and it will go. It's maybe not the best time, but if you need help, just ask me. When I came here I thought it'd be easier. Suddenly it's not just one but a whole pile of problems at the same time. You become imprisoned in it... It's hard for someone with no experience. Is there something in particular that's not going well? The problem's not just money, father. I'm a bit worried. Sometimes you just don't know what tomorrow'll bring. What are you reading? Where did you get those books? Let me see! Look at these pictures... You can't understand a thing! Do you know what they're saying about the old man? About Diamantino? That he hung himself on purpose on the veranda. Do you know why? So that everybody could see his children didn't pay any attention to him! Shut up!... What does "dissipate" mean? Dissipate? Do you remember the idiot's parents? They went to the city again to get the girl. Her family must have been nuts to let her go! But without a woman, you know what it's like Why are they always taking the mick? What happened to your friend? When's he coming? Does it suit me? Give me that! Let go! Take your hands off! Then we go down, stop at Bari... Brindici, the boat... And then, Greece. - And afterwards? - Wait! So we can have two or three days in Athens. And hop around the islands! - Will we have time? - There will be lots of time. Great, at least two months... Nuno, I've got a letter for you here. What is it? That's my trip down the drain then. My sister says she hasn't got any money. I don't believe it! Can't you do anything? It's been a bad year They've got to pay for the seeds and make a lot of investment. I'll go round there and see if I can convince her. Laura... Laura! Alberto, come here, please. See if you can deliver this as soon as you are ready. You weren't waiting for me... Admit it! Who did you come with? I'm not telling you. Where are the others? Artur's out there working. Are you hungry? I don't want anything. I'm going for a walk. Bye. Hello. How's things? Are you in a hurry? A bit. I'm really thirsty. Fancy a drink? Come on, just one. Are you leaving the bike here? No problem, nobody steals anything here. What are you doing here then? Stop being so formal. You didn't have to bother about the shirt... Where are you going tonight? I don't know what time I'm leaving. I've got some things to do. What's that music? It's from the dance. There's a dance nearly every day in the evenings. We could go there and then go to the disco. The disco? You must be joking... Why? I bet you'll have a good time. I never bet. I know everybody. Shall we go? Take it. I've already had two. It doesn't matter, just one more... Your father's abroad isn't he? Have you got any brothers? A younger one. He lives with my mother. Mr. Artur likes him a lot. He gave him a watch for his birthday. But the kid lost it near the river. My mother was going to do him in! - And what about Z?? - It's as if he were my brother. That one with the green dress is looking at you. Do you know her? She's not from here. She must be looking at you. Not even that one who's waving? That's the teacher's daughter Well... I'm off. But you stay if you want. No, no, stay here! Let me go! Hello Alberto. How did you get here? I came with him. It's the lady's brother. She asked you how, not who with. We both came on foot. Very funny... Do you know everybody's talking about you? All good, I hope. So far!... What time does this finish? Four o'clock, but at weekends there's a matinee. Well, I've got to go. Have a good time. You see, nobody's biting you. How about another drink? Your health! I'm so hungry... If I was in Lisbon we could go to a cafe and have cakes. But here... Oh yes? Only if you like country bread. I've got cheese too. And wine, do you fancy some? Yes, please. Nuno... Do you want anything from the city? No. Hello. When are you going? See you later. Come on, please, we've got to talk. What happened then? I was waiting all morning. What? Don't play the fool. Or don't you even read my letter? What letter? I haven't had a letter. Aren't you lying? What an obsession! - Mr. Francisco! - What is it? - Come down here, please. - All right, I'm coming. This is dangerous. It'll all come out sooner or later. You've got to help me! We can't meet alone. I know it's difficult. I don't want to hear. Alberto! Why didn't you do what I told you to? Answer me! Don't turn your back on me! Why didn't you deliver the letter? How can you be so sure? Nuno, you've got to realize there are rules in this house. You can't just do what you want, without giving something back. It's a bit late to try and educate me... It's a matter of respect. It's not a hotel. I thought it better Artur didn't know you didn't come home last night. All right. I'll warn you next time. Where's Alberto? Outside in the field. Are you Z?? They're in the beehive now. They won't come out until it's cooler. The sheep?... They feel the heat a lot, don't they? Haven't you seen Alberto? I haven't seen him, no. Alberto! Where are you going? Wait! Wait! - Where were you going? - It doesn't matter. I was only asking. I don't have to explain to you. We've got to talk. Leave me alone! Wait! Wait! You're wasting your time. I don't care. You can't go just like that. Don't you realize I might have reasons? Has something happened? And have you at least said goodbye to Z?? Is it his fault? Don't do it to him! Have you eaten yet? I've had dinner already Did you go to the garage? Yes, and I think Francisco's tractor's been worked out. It will be hard to get credit. I've asked Anselmo to sell it without a guarantee. I told him I'd be responsible. But that I didn't want Francisco to know What about the deposit? He reduced it to the minimum The minimum'll be a lot. What about Nuno? Isn't he coming to dinner? No. He must be out with his friends. I would like to talk to you about Alberto. It's about something he told Nuno. Look at the lady looking at you. Want to bet I'm going to get another? Maybe... I brought this so we could celebrate. Celebrate what? Do you still have to ask? Because you didn't go away. Don't do it again, will you? You're a right one you are... Say you won't. So you don't believe me? Not really... Burn it. Was it for me? Don't you want to say? Well, it doesn't matter. We had to arrange something. And take Z?. He's tied up with other things... Go on, laugh! I'm enjoying this. It's all so simple really... Who put that into your head? There's lots of things about the country that you don't know. People aren't what you think. You shouldn't be so untrusting. Nobody I trust has even grown teeth yet. What about me? I don't know. Maybe. Thank goodness I've found you. My husband went to Artur's yesterday to invite them to Gra?a's birthday, but Nuno wasn't there. Can you tell me where I can find him? Have you seen him? Not recently, no. But they say you're as thick as thieves... What about your father? Has he written to you? Not to me. Good morning, teacher. Hello, Nano. We were just talking about you. I heard... What time is the party? Turn up at the beginning of the afternoon. I'm sorry, but I have to go. Don't forget what we are going to do tonight! See you later, teacher. Just as well I haven't forgotten the rice pudding. There are so many sweets... When you have a home and get married, then you'll save. One can't tell you anything! You're not grateful, that's the problem. Artur and Francisco love my rice pudding. So what? Do you think I don't know about your meetings! Meetings! Friendly conversations. And do you see him with others? Aren't they all eaten up with jealousy? Look, whoever has to belong to us... already belongs to us. Francisco doesn't want to compromise you without having a guaranteed future. It just goes to show he's a sensible boy. There you go mother! How ridiculous! Hello, Francisco! Hello Gra?a. Congratulations. Thank you. Well, some flowers. I didn't know what to get you. They're fine. I'll put them in water. That's a lovely blouse. Do you like it? It's the first time I wear it. It was my grandmother's. It suits you. Thanks. Everything's late. Fancy a stroll round the garden? Well hello! Come in. My dear Artur, welcome. Are you well? Hello, how are you, Artur? Very well, thanks. And you? You look great, you look really great. Look, after telling me that I daren't tell you you're looking fine, because you really are. Are you giving me flowers? These are for me Hello, son, how are you? Fine. Hello, Laura. Artur, come with me to the cellar. Help me choose a wine. You've got to put them in water. Did you put the napkins on the table like your mother wanted? Yes. What about the snacks? Are they nicely set out? This is turning into a real party. It's not only the other one that's a party. I've got some from various years. But Artur, I called you to warn you. It's quite likely your brother-in-law won't turn up today. It's possible. Don't pay any attention. He must have fixed something up. You've got a 1980 here! I've been keeping it for a special day. Good, Gra?a deserves a good wine. Doesn't she! Have you had many problems with the rain? It's good for some things and bad for others. At least the sheep have got plenty to eat. Have you still managed to make cheese? It should be a bit rough. It'll be better next year. Isn't your brother coming then? He's got a bit of a cold. But I saw him only today. He never stops. He fell down just a few days ago, bruised his arm and then went to play football. That's a sign of vitality, Artur. - That's what you think. - I do. Have you seen the Martins' new house? Is it ready yet? Almost. It must be horrible inside! "Panneaux" with deer and plastic flowers. All they need now is to serve watermelon with whisky. Well, go in, I'll call the others. Would you like to come now? It's all ready. What's happened to your brother, Laura? I never saw him again. He's only got eyes for the farm now. It's city enthusiasm. That's a good reason for him to go to mine. Laura, take him there. And you Gra?a, you go too. That's all right by me. Did you do all this, Gra?a? More or less, with my mother's help. What a table. I didn't know you were so talented. Well, you know now! Aren't you eating then, aren't you drinking? Let's go. That was a nice party. We see them so little though they live so close. Did you notice Gra?a? She's a real woman! Yes, we can't live so cut off. And Francisco, if he's not careful he'll go the same way. Maybe not. Didn't you see him with Gra?a? That doesn't mean anything. Why? She's an interesting girl. You could go to the farm... If you want to go tomorrow you can take the car. I'll tell Nuno. The two of you can go then. But didn't you invite Gra?a? Yes, but it must have been Francisco's idea. You're very tired, dear. I've got a busy day tomorrow. Let's go to bed. Alberto! Alberto! Wake up, the boss is looking for you! Alberto! Alberto! Wake up! You're behind with everything! Did you feed the cattle yesterday? This can't go on! Get up immediately! Psst! Mr. Nuno! What is it? Your sister wants to throw Alberto out. I couldn't help overhearing. They don't trust him. What? Yes, he's been spreading it round that bosses are bosses, that they're selfish and all that. Your sister was telling Mr. Artur. And what did he say? He said it didn't matter. But your sister really wants to throw him out. What about Alberto? Where is he? Nuno, let's go. Come on, or we'll be late. Would you like something to drink? - No, thank you. Do you want something? - No thanks, I don't feel like anything. I'd like to go over the accounts with you. It won't take long. Where are the sheep? Go down the steps. They're to the left. Beware of the ram. Were you waiting for somebody else besides us? Who? I don't know. I don't know your friends. Let's not argue. I don't want to argue. Can't we talk without hurting each other now? Yesterday you were in a better mood. It's ages since I'd seen you like that. What do you mean? Nothing. It probably doesn't concern me. Well, ask me, and I'll tell you. Are you thinking of marrying Gra?a? She's very young. And she's got a future. Well, if you don't intend to man her, what are your intentions? I don't think men are very strong in this kind of thing. With me, I don't know how it is... You've said enough already. I haven't said everything. In fact I've said very little. Will you stay for lunch? No, thanks. When you're brave enough. Nuno! Come here. We're leaving in a minute. Penny for them? It's nothing. Why have you got such a long face then? Did you see the sheep? It's getting to be a real herd now. Yes. I've been worried about Alberto at work. And your behaviour... Why don't you ask before you jump to conclusions? I'm asking you now. It won't help. Tell me. It's always the same! I want, I can and I order, isn't that right, Laura? You told Artur about my talk with Alberto. And distorted it at that! What do you want from us? Let's stop and have a drink. I'm really thirsty. Do you mind stopping? Alberto, we've got to have a very serious talk. Go on. What do you know? If it's what you're thinking, I know everything. Well, that's just as well. Now we can speak frankly, give me the letter. Pretending you can't hear me won't help. It'd be better for you to give it back to me. If you haven't enough money to go to your father I can give it to you. I burnt it. Are you kidding me? Give me the letter and I won't say a word about what happened between you and Nuno. Nothing happened. That's worse for you. Nuno told me everything... What did he tell you? Do you think you know him?... Do you want me to repeat it? No, it's not necessary. What happened to you? There are lots of problems... trouble... Do you think we could speak for a while? Could it be now? I'd rather some other time. As you wish. Shall we get together later on? Let's go to the disco tonight? Wait for me there. - Come on, fill it up. - All right, but it's the last one. I'm not pouring any more wine. Mr. Magalh?es, give me another glass, come on, just a little glass. A full one. So, did you come on your own? I'm waiting for someone. Who is it? A friend. Fancy a bop? No, thanks. I don't really fancy it. Do you know what I've got in my room at home? One of those bottles of red wine with cobwebs and everything... I went down to the cellar to get it. What are you going to do down there? The girls won't take any notice of you. You'll just make an idiot of yourself. Well, if you're going I'm going too. It's a free country. - You can't come in. - I'm with him... Get out! Hit the road! Go to bed! Alberto! He won't let me in! I'll wait for you out here! Do you want a drink? Do I look like a fool? What? Those blokes won't stop staring at me. Who? Leave me alone! Are you crazy? They haven't done anything to you. I don't like people messing me about. Do you? They haven't provoked you. When Alberto got shit-faced, I was the one who had to take care of him. He made me walk up and down. Either wanting to go home or back to the disco. Then I took him up the hill to catch some air. Get up, Nuno. What is it? Alberto's outside. He can't stand up. Go and help him. And see if you can't calm the boy down. He almost broke my door in. Look at what they've done to him! Help me get him up. There were three of 'em! I wasn't strong enough. You should have been there! I won't say anything. They'll all be talking about it tomorrow! He's not always like this, people just don't understand him. Forget it, Z?. Go to bed. I'll take care of him. Wake up! What is it? Drink it. It's hot. I don't want it... I'm sick. Drink it, it'll do you good. It's still early. Nobody knows you stayed here. What happened? You got drunk and they beat you up. What did I say? Nothing we could understand. You were waving your arms around, then you calmed down. That's all. Have another drink. I've got to go. Relax. Let me go! Leave me alone! What is it? Don't you know? Should I know? You and your sister. You're worthless. What have they been telling you about me? It doesn't matter... You're always saying you can't trust anybody, but you believe everything you hear! Aren't you capable of facing problems? What do you expect me to do? You're right. It's impossible like this. I can't stand it anymore. Why don't the two of us leave now? Where to? We'll see, there's no time to lose now. Your clothes are still wet. Put something of Francisco's on. It should fit you. Hurry up and meet me at the bridge. You go out first. I'll meet you there. Francisco! I never even imagined... Believe it. I never wanted to hurt you. I never did. It was so complicated... Forget it, it's all over now. Don't say another word about it. You understand me. It's been hard for everybody. But it's over now. Nuno, do you think he knows? Who? Nothing's happened, has it? We'll have to go for a stroll. I want to show you the farm. It's very beautiful. We've hardly spoken since you arrived. Don't worry. We're together now. I'll be back soon.
