If you did not exist Tell me how I would exist I could pretend to be me But I would not be real A WIDOW AT LAST If you did not exist I think I would have found it The secret to life, the reason why Simply to create you And to look at you If you did not exist Tell me how I would exist In a world without you Without hope and without regret Frankly, you don't really need it, but as you insist, the incision is made under the buttocks under general anesthetic. You can get dressed. But, Doctor, I eat like a bird. Birds eat their own body weight. I gain weight, just looking at a cake. Don't look. Not easy in my profession. You are...? About 140 pounds. No, your profession. I'm a pastry chef. I see... Doctor, how much does it cost? 3.500 euros. 3.500? For both thighs? Why? You got any more? Uh, no, Doctor. "Neli"... No, "nali". Meaning? I want a manicure. Not much use. Got anything else? What's that? Hello, pleased to meet you. Good. Start again. The book says "i" is pronounced "ay". - It's "shay". - Are you sure? - Look. - They speak English? Suits me. They'll like a few words of welcome in Chinese. We'll have to speak it there. Might as well start. It's not a done deal yet. Come on... The Chinese! Why are they here? They're due tomorrow! Well, they're here now! Maurice, buy some tea. Good stuff! They're tea crazy over there. Pierrot, tidy up. Saadi, get Brigitte's teapot, cups and spoons. Hurry up! No, but listen, Leo, I gotta tell you... I'm not going! You're not going? I'm not going to China. I wanted to tell you tonight. Why aren't you going? It's Valerie. She won't go. You tell me that now?! You were the first who wanted to go. I'll talk to Valerie. You'll never get another chance to work on a boat like this. We're going to work on the St John! She mustrt stop you! Or she doesn't love you! She does. It's the Chinese she doesn't like. She doesn't mind the odd one from time to time, but over there in China, they're everywhere! There aren't that many. Not that many. Hello, folks. I'm Leo... Leo Labaume. Delighted to meet you. Hang on, I'll do it in your... I've just learned it. No, thanks, we've already eaten. What is it? What's she doing there? Oh, no! I'll love you more than you ever imagined I'll love you... - What're you doing here? - Seen the time? You're home early. We're invited to Duval's birthday. You forget? I thought it was tomorrow. - Never mind what you thought. - Sorry. I'll get changed. Wait for me, Sissi. Come here. Heel, Sissi. OK, go on, then. Mrs Gratigny, I'm going. - I was looking for you. - Under the bed? Yes, no... uh, where's my bag? - On the bed. - Right. You never find something staring you in the face. - Looking for anything else? - No. Maybe I can help. OK, listen... How can I put it? It's about this size... It's silvery grey. With little buttons on it. Your cellphone? What? I've never had a cellphone! The house is full of phones. Why'd I need a cellphone? You see? So, don't talk nonsense. Where's the other? There. Here you are. - Thanks. - I'm off. Nicole... What I don't understand is... What's all this about cellphones? Have you found one? With the dish towels. The dish towels! We need to buy dish towels! How about that? What's it doing there? Oh, silly me! It's the kids next door! Yes, when they came over the other day! The neighbors came over for drinks the other day. Oh, no, you werert there. Yes, you were! No, you werert. Anyway, they came over. Amazing, huh? It looks real. It is real, Mrs Gratigny. Real! Look, Nicole! It's fake. Look at the buttons. It's come on! It has? Yes, it has come on and... I'll tell you why. It has batteries. I'm off now. Don't tell my husband, will you? If he hears the neighbors put kids... I mean, the neighbors' dish towels... I mean, it's not difficult! Forget it. Off you go. Darling, it's me. My love, I only wish I could speak to you. Hope you get this soon. Anne-Marie! Now what? Listen, I think I can smell gas. Gas? It's electric! C'mon, get in the car. No way! That's out of the question! That's a one-year contract! Me know well boat to be restored. Me need one year and a half. Minimum! Me and my friends sign contract for one year and a half! The tea! Work is one thing, pleasure is quite another! - Is that the best tea service? - We had no time. No time. What's that? No idea. Down south, that's how we drink it. In little white cups which we call plastic beakers! Thanks a bunch! What now? I have dog hair all over me again! Look after her - she wouldn't come in the car. Don't start that again. I'm not a dog person. Look. "The future of energy". You should go along. Energy reserves aren't limitless. In 100 years, there'll be 15 billion of us. We'll be in trouble. Big trouble! What's ringing? Ringing? Can't you hear it? Oh, yes, something's ringing. What is it? It's you! You're ringing there! I completely forgot! Why the cellphone? I found it this morning in the street. Answer it. See whose it is. Go on, what're you waiting for? Hello, Matie, it's me. Sorry, sir, you've made a mistake. Mistake? A mistake? It was for someone I don't know. Of course you don't! It's not your phone! Jeez! Give me that! Give... - You turned it off! - Did I? - Yes, you did! - I didn't mean to. Can't we turn it on again? Then what? You got the code? You need a code! How can anyone be so goddam dumb? I'll go to the police. No, I'll go. I have nothing else to do. You always mess up. It's the mistake speaking. The mistake would like you to call him back. I suppose your husband is nearby. I'll pick you up at 6, like we said. I have some great news for you. See you later, my love. In 250 yards, take Exit 11. Exit 11? Is she stupid? Maybe she wants you to get off here... Look, you can't even find the bathroom at night, so, don't play Mrs GPS! Sorry, but your Matie isn't here, fella. Your seagull doesn't sound very realistic. With hara-kiri, you start here and you go up. No, you start there and you twist it. You twist it? Hi, Leo! Long live the St John! - To the St John! - OK, OK! - St John! - Enough! Hey, didn't you have a date? We'll miss you, you know. Here. The little worm before you wants the same. I've only got 2 hands! Hey, Pierrot, celebrating your departure? Leaving a wife and 4 kids! - Valerie... - Stay away! What have these little angels ever done to you? What'll I tell 'em? Their dad's gone to work on the other side of the world? How'll I manage on my own? Who'll decorate the Christmas tree and put the star up at the top? Whose arms will swing them like an airplane? Who'll play sea-lion with them? - You play sea-lion? - At bath time. What'll your treasures think? That you're a rat fink! Rat fink! It's your fault! You home wrecker! You orphan maker! Rat fink! Enough! - Rat fink! - Stop it! Magnificent! I told you. Thank you so much, Anne-Marie. It's a fine choice. Thank you, I'm very touched. Hey, Gilbert, remember your birthday last year? We drank so much, the next day we were in no state to operate. I don't remember the operation! Nightmare! I don't know how I did it! Yes, and I had to work on Mrs Morisot's eyelids. I couldn't even see straight! Nor could she after! She had the works done to keep her husband. End result: He left her! But best of all, he left her for an older woman! End result: She ended up alone. A new look, but all alone! Do excuse me. Be right back. No, that's the phone booth! End result: She had a breakdown, started drinking, took antidepressants. End result: She's all puffy. Her eyes were her best feature. You can't see 'em anymore. End result: She looks 20 years older! I think she'll commit suicide. I see no other solution. Let's go. No, you go. I'll just fix my makeup. I'll wait. I hate crossing the room alone. - Silly, isn't it? - Oh, well... I feel people's eyes on me. End result: I bump into chairs. Actually, I'm really shy. Know what you should do? Permanent makeup like mine around the lips. I did my lips, my eyes and my eyebrows. End result: Even first thing in the morning, I'm already at my best! What'd I do with myself? Same as here. Look after your kids, spend your evenings with Pierrot, like any loving couple. Decorate the tree, play the seal... Sea-lion! He'll see his kids grow up. In 18 months, we'll be back, with a wealth of... memories. A unique experience. Hong Kong! - Who's never dreamed of going there? - Me! Wow, Hong Kong! Pierrot needs you, Valerie. He's going, but you're leaving him if you don't come. Don't let your love go adrift. Do not let it sink! Not sink! I can't! I can't go! You can! I'm scared of flying! Well, in that case... So, what? She's scared of flying. It's only natural. I think that after a certain age, it's common courtesy to have a face-lift. It's virtually risk free nowadays. See? Listen to the man. She's scared. Anne-Marie's not old enough yet. It wouldn't need much. Just smooth the forehead slightly... Stretch the skin here... The scar would be behind the ear. - Invisible... - Please! It would look great. Maybe, but I don't want to change. Yes, but that's the problem, people do change! Grandma is sleeping in her living room. Repeat after me. Exercise 4. Grandpa is brushing his teeth in the bathroom. Repeat after me. A tidal power station requires high tides. The power of the world's tides is 3 billion kilowatts. A third is lost along the coasts. If we harnessed just 20%, we... If you're bored, change channels. I can't bear listening to you. I didn't speak! You said it nonetheless! Change channels. You're ruining my channel pre-selection! 'Night. Come on, girl. Come on, Sissi. Hurry up, let's go. Why are you here so early? I'm leaving early. The neighbor's had a heart attack. Oh, great! Where are my car keys? By the phone. What'll I cook today? Nothing. Gilbert will be home late, I'll eat some fruit. - Bye. I'm going jogging. - By car? Yes! No! No, the car keys are because I have to go to the garage. It's been making a noise. You'll lose your shoe. No, the shoe in your pocket. Yes, that's... to remind me to go to the shoe-repairer's, too. Garage, then shoe-repairer's. It's a mnemonic. Well, goodbye. "Mnemo" what? Hello, Mrs Gratigny. You're up early today. Mind you, one swallow doesn't make a summer! Darling, it's Matie. I don't have my cellphone anymore. It's complicated... Sorry about last night. I couldn't make it. I'll tell you later. I'm waiting for you at your place. Come right over when you hear this message. OK, guys, put that there. Hi, Mrs Gratigny. Hello. Wort be long. Bye, Mrs Gratigny. They'll suspect... No! What're you talking about? - Darling! - I waited all night. We won't see much of him now. Think she'll go to China? Her? Never! She'll go. She won't. She's married. Yeah, sure! I pity her husband. I bet she's Little Miss Chastity Belt to him! What? China? For 18 months? Is that your good news?! Yes, we leave in 10 days. I knew you'd come. You knew? But how? How can I come? You make decisions without thinking of me! I'm married, you know! Precisely! We can't live together here, but we could thousands of miles away! What're you doing? Let's eat and talk. I'm not hungry now! You get dressed and leave... I say we can at last live together and you get dressed and leave! You should... jump in my arms, say, "It's the happiest day of my life! Let's go away and never be apart again! I couldn't bear us being apart!" That's what a lover would say! I love you! I do love you! You take my breath away! But don't you see? In 10 days? It's impossible! I can't be ready that fast. I can't... Then, you'll never leave. I'll join you. You're lying. I'll wait for you. You're not lying now, but I'm through with that. Stealing the odd hour together, like tonight till midnight... Is that your idea of love? Know why I signed so readily? I didn't doubt you. You're not sure, you need time! You dare to say I take your breath away? Well, it's easy to take your breath away! Damn easy! He doesn't need bunches! They're braids. Pierrot, what're you doing? Use a brush, not a roller! No-one'll see this but the fish! Go braid your hair! You were right, she won't go. Who's whistling? It's a pain in the ass! Work hard, guys. I, uh... It's just that... I forgot... I... Good, Pierrot. The fish will be pleased! A fish's smile matters! What did I tell you? She'll go! Anne-Marie! You take my breath away! It's the happiest day of my life! Let's go away and never be apart again. I couldn't bear us being apart ever again. But help me. I don't know what to do. He scares me. I won't be able to tell him. Don't tell him - just leave. Without a word. Shouldrt I write a letter? You look sick. I had a late night. Drank too much. And I have trouble digesting chicken and mushrooms. Same here. The sight of all this fat... No suction, Doctor. Holy cow! She blocked the damn thing! Christiane... It's Emilie! You finish her off. I've still got 2 chins and a rhino to do. Keep it short. Don't elaborate. Yes, you're right. "My darling..." "My darling"? Yes... Oh, no! "Gilbert"..."Dear Gilbert"... Drop it. He'll know it's for him. You're right. I'll drop it. "When you read this, I'll have gone". Not "When you read this". He'll see he's reading it. "I'm leaving". "I'm leaving. I've loved someone else for the past 2 years". No, he'll understand that. Well, I can't tell him I met you yesterday! Don't go into detail. I'll scratch that. "I met a man I love more than all else. I've decided to live with him". Don't say that. You're torturing him. Are you protecting him? Whose side are you on? You can still spare his feelings. It says, "I'm leaving". He'll think I've gone to buy bread! OK... Write down: "I met a man"... "A man"... "I've decided to live with him". "I know that... you will... suffer"... If you know, don't put it! "But you and me... are... through". He'll have figured that out. "Kisses"... No "Kisses". "No kisses"... No, don't put it. I'll sign. Don't sign it. He knows it's you. What has she done to this? It's all messed up now! No, she's out. I have no idea. I don't believe it! How's the dog? That's something. I'm sorry, I find it a bit too blunt. Read it through. From the top. "I'm leaving. Farewell". It's concise. I wonder if "I'm leaving" is really necessary. When did it happen? - Did he die instantly? - No, I heard he suffered. He tried to get out of the car and dragged himself along. Nonsense! The driver of the tractor got him out. He was a mess. I heard he was in 2 pieces. - The dog? - Same! In 2 pieces? No! Dead! No, the dog survived. Oh, good! Yes, but even a clever dog isn't quite the same. Well, I'm not so sure. What do you think, Rascal? Poor Mrs Gratigny... She hasn't heard. No-one knows where she is. - You're the fairest in the world. - Really? You're exaggerating slightly. I love everything about you. Except your name. You don't like "Anne-Marie"? Sounds like "marry". Reminds me of him. He's not really a husband anymore. We're so different. He likes dogs and the sea, I like cats and the mountains. My darling, when we get back from China, let's go live in Val St Vincent. Val St Vincent? What's Val St Vincent? It's a tiny village in the mountains. I dream of living there. You know, in a chalet, with a cat purring on my lap all day... - In that place... - Val St Vincent? Yes, Val St Vincent. How would I build boats in the snow? No, Leo! Don't! Do your boats really need water? Well, yes, Matie, they do! They're always in the boatyard! Why make 'em watertight? Build 'em in the mountains! You're joking? That's just typical of men! So blinkered! Stop at red lights! A tie goes around the neck! A boatyard is by the water! It lacks spontaneity! My grape! I'll give you spontaneity! She went out to go to the shoe-repairer's, then the garage for that pneumatic thingy... Doesrt she have a cellphone? A cellphone? I don't know about that! All I know is, I keep my dish towels over there! That's all I know! Poor Mr Gratigny... Poor Sissi! You must be in so much pain. The dog's alive, but has a broken tail. Should've been the other way around! No, Viviane, I can't pick you up now. Hang on. Could someone get my aunt? She can't find a taxi. Well, it's just that my car... I'll go. What's she wearing? OK, what are you wearing? Thigh boots. I'll go... I said I'd go, so I'm going. Why isn't she here? It's not normal. - Matie... - Yes? I want a child. Oh, you know, I... I already had Christophe, so... I couldn't do it again. I don't mean, have one! I want us to adopt one in China. I know people there who can help. Say yes. Yes... I love you! Is that the time? My shoes! Don't panic. You live 5 minutes away. He may not be home. But what'll I say if I'm not there? The letter... Give it to him. We said I'd give it to him at the last minute. Please, find my shoes. I'll say I was at the movies! See what's on. A comedy - he hates 'em. I won't have to go into detail. There's "The Big Wave". Carina Masson and Jean-Luc Ermio. Who? I don't know, but that'd work. Just finished. You're almost early! OK, what's it about? "Two drunk soldiers end up in a strip club, instead of being back at barracks. They meet a girl called "Big Wave", because she's big and has wavy hair. The two soldiers get dragged into a series of hilarious adventures." There, that's good. I guess... Your sister will be here soon. Must be with friends. She has none. It's good of you to come, but... Company does you good. What's going on? - Mom! - Why are you here? Viviane! We'll be off. You scared us. - I went to see "The Big Whale". - It's Dad. - It's Gilbert. - It's Mr Gratigny. Dad had an accident. An accident? A fatal accident. Is he hurt? It was fatal, Mom. Fatal... You mean he's dead? We're here, Mom. We're here. But the dog's OK. It won't replace him, but it's a comfort. You know, my love, maybe I'm a monster. I don't feel a thing. Just empty, you know. Totally empty. Shock? I'm not in shock! I told you, I feel nothing! That's because there was nothing between you. How's your mother? She's being very dignified, very brave. Do they treat you well? Have they put a nice TV in for you? Are your pals nice to you? Do the nurses get you to do your exercises? Do you eat all your fish on Fridays, Gaby? Why's she talking like that? "She"! It's me! Viviane! I didn't recognize you, Yvette. No, I'm Viviane! Yes, that's right... Yvette, and you've aged a lot if you ask me. Never mind. I'll see you later. I do have to see to the funeral. It's the least I can do. If it was up to me, I wouldn't go. It's a pain. I've got nothing to wear. I really don't care! Not in the slightest. You know, now I... I don't care about anything anymore. It was so sudden. You have company, so I'll go. I must see you. I need your passport for the visa. And I need you by my side. Thank you for calling. Alexia! Gaby! I'm hungry! You'll be alright, Gaby. Want a glass of water? Let's call a doctor. I am a doctor! Not yet! You're in Year 3. You studied Gaby yet? We came as fast as we could. It's awful. I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. What's with him? It's my fault. I wanted him to understand Dad was dead. I said, "Your sors dead". He understood and said, "Gilbert!" Then, he collapsed. Dad! He's losing his mind. Stop saying his sors dead. 2 minutes later, he's forgotten all about it. Viviane's right for once. Stop telling him that. You're too fragile, Dad! How's your mother? Devastated. Anne-Marie... Been here long? No, we just arrived. Poor Gilbert... Yes, poor Gilbert. That's a pretty color. Very... cheerful. I'm trying to keep busy to stop myself thinking. Yes, it's a good idea to keep your mind off things. It was so sudden. I just can't believe it. So I see! Of course she's sad. She's in shock, that's all. Stop imagining things. Would you put on nail polish the day I die? She doesn't care about his death, just her own comfort! She's been kept her whole life. Never worked. Not interested in anything. Not a thing! Gilbert was someone who was cultured, brilliant! He was refined, an esthete! Why did he marry her? It's a mystery to me. You can't even say it was for his image, because she's not pretty. Must be for sex! Sex! She's clearly a woman who's sex-mad. That's how she kept hold of Gilbert. Where's the bride? Gaby, it's a funeral. Oh, my God! Did someone die? Yes, Gaby, Gilbert did. Oh, my God! Lt'll be alright, Dad. That was smart! Don't tell him Gilbert's dead. It'll be OK, Dad, don't worry. I want to tell you... I need to pee. Oh, can't you wait till later? Wait! I'll deal with it. Come on, Gaby. Gaby, are you alright? There, there... The hardest part starts now. So, she broke down at the cemetery... I've never seen her like that. It's the first time she's lost a husband. She didn't look all that devastated to me. I'm going shopping. There's no food. Mom, please, have a rest. Just some bread... You know the storekeepers - they'll talk about Dad. You're still too fragile. Come sit down. Christophe is right. We'll go. C'mon, darling. Stop calling me darling! Let's go... Dad, we're coming back. Let him. It'll do him good to have a walk. It cost 28 euros. She didn't even recognize me earlier on. Go on, Nathalie. The doc gave her something for her nerves. And it's powerful stuff. Will she be able to fly? She couldn't even fly a kite. She's so sluggish. She won't fly the plane! They won't let you out? You find a way. I need your passport by tomorrow morning. Come after dinner. Say you need a walk. You don't know them. They'll come, too. I can't take a single step by myself. Oh, no, here they go again! Yes, come in. It's OK, it's the dog. No, Sissi, get down. You're crazy! I can't! I can see you tomorrow after they've gone. Tomorrow's too late. I'm getting the visas tomorrow. I need your passport tonight. They'll go to bed sooner or later. Yes, wait till they're asleep. OK, but not before midnight. I'll be at your place between 12 and 1, OK? Your turn, Leo. Coming. What's your name? I'm Nathalie. - I'm hungry. - I'll bring the menu. Sleeping all day like that isn't natural. Here's the Slug! Take it before I drop it. It's her airplane pills. The other night, she fell asleep during sex. You left the door open! He must've opened it. Oh, he's not under the seat! - He can't be far. - Well, where is he, then? The eggs! It's him, I tell you. He came here on vacation. I sometimes served him. He seems over his sors death. He's dead? Car crash. Winkles. Winkles! Excuse me, I'm looking for an old man... White hair... You've not seen him? Winkles. No, that's disgusting! Don't listen to her. They're great. Hello. Can I buy you a drink? I heard the news about your son. What about him? Mr Gratigny, Gilbert Gratigny was your son? Oh, Dad! What're you doing here? We were scared stiff! His sors death... Gilbert? Yes, Gilbert's waiting for us. Sors death? Gilbert's fine! You're talking nonsense. C'mon, Gilbert will be worried. I bought a cake. We're all having dinner with Gilbert. We're having Gilbert's favorite cake. You'll love it. There'll be Gilbert, there'll be... Mind the steps... What? What is it? Nothing. In a way, it's a good thing he's not dead. Awake now? Pretend you're having sex! Don't insult her just 'cause Anne-Marie's trouble! OK, I'm sorry, Valerie, I didn't mean... Asleep again! Why'd she lie? Who lied? Your Matie! Well, her husband's alive. The old guy's a nutter. The people who fetched him werert. Your girl's trying not to go away with you. That'd be a huge lie. So, call her. What for? I'm seeing her later. What? She'll come. She will! She's bringing her passport. He's dead! Completely dead! Stone dead! Why are you shouting? I'm not. I'm explaining! I made paella. You did well, Nicole. Nicole, I'm not very hungry, you know. But... You do have to eat. Thank you. Put it there. We'll manage. Yes, Mom, I know you can't be very hungry. Just have some for me. Try to eat that. What a pity, it's delicious. You should force yourself. I think I've eaten too much. Leave it. We'll do it tomorrow. It'll take two minutes. I'm off. It's late. Yes, it is late! Nicole's going to bed, because it's late. Goodnight. We'll all do the same... later... Time for herb tea. - Now?! - Yeah. OK, but be quick, because I am... dead! Just dead on my feet! What...? What the...? Let's see our Corsica photos. What a good idea. Gilbert would love to see this. The Corsica photos... We went there for 15 years! We'll be up till 4! No-one feels like sleeping. No, I can't... No. You go to bed. We won't make any noise. No, your poor father just... Seeing him in shorts in the bush, eating coppa ham... It's much too soon to see those photos. And too late. Please, Mom... I need to do this. You go to bed. Yes, Anne-Marie, get some rest. Yes, Anne-Marie, get some sleep. He loved to clown around. He was cold. I'm hungry! Dad, you just ate. That's upside down. You've touched something! It's a sign, I know it. Gilbert's sending us a sign! Got a lighter? He's showing himself. The fuse blew. Don't start. I'm hungry! Dad, you walked on the dog's tail! Oh, be quiet! Gilbert? No, it's me. Don't panic. - There's no light. - It often happens. The fuse box... It's locked, and I don't know where the key is. - Call Nicole. - No, she's sleeping. I'm afraid we'll just have to follow her example. - What a pity. - Yes, I know. Or else she comes and lives in Paris. Near our place. I'm afraid that living here with Dad's memories... She'll be fine. I took a look at your dad's accounts. Your mother's future is financially secure. She's not into money. My pal, Fred... Same thing. He had to put his mother in a home. It was a good home. They wash them every day. Manicure Wednesdays, hairdresser Tuesdays, singing or pottery on Friday nights. - Thursdays... - We're not there yet. She's young. She can start over. Start over? That's an obscene thing to say! Dad was her whole life. What can she start at her age? True... I'll call Fred. To put her away? - You wouldn't do that? - No. Not just yet. Isn't that your mother over there? Mom's sleeping. It is your mother! Shit! What is she doing? Cycling. Cycling! What's up? Well, it's because I... I couldn't... Calm down, Mom. Yes, it's just that I was... Iooking for you. Is it the baby? No, he's sleeping. So, why were you looking for us? Because I... I couldn't sleep. And you needed to talk? Yes, a bit... To talk to me? Yes, I mean, I... I'm here. Shall I sleep with you, like the old days? - No way! - Come on. Let's go... Let's go inside. I'm not sleepy, either. We can talk... all night, if you want. You need to talk. We'll go now. Some things don't concern us. C'mon, Mom, give me your coat. No, let's go talk outside. Yes, by the pool... where Dad read his paper. Right. Remember that time he tried to make apple pie? - How we laughed! - We did. So hard, we couldn't cut it! But he wouldn't give up. He said... "The harder, the better!" Yes, "the harder, the better". He sure could laugh. Yeah. He loved classical music. Remember what he also sang? "In Joinville-Le-Pont". Yes. In Joinville-Le-Pont... Pont, pont We'll walk on the prom Prom, prom Watch 'em dance At Gegene's Me and my lady Just you and me We too can dance At Gegene's By the water, there are shrimpers In the river, there are bathers We see folk eating mussels Or fries if they don't like mussels OK, thank you. - It's good to talk. - Yes. - We should do it more often. - Yes. - Shall I close the drapes? - No! Noisy ducks! It's a seagull. Will you sleep? Get some rest. Tomorrow's another day. - 'Night, Mom. - 'Night. Come down! I've got the passport! Gilbert? Gilbert, is that you? I don't believe it! My love! Mom? It's the wind! Where is she? There's glass everywhere. She hasn't jumped out! You'd kill yourself. Exactly, Catherine! It's like in "The Exorcist" when a lamp falls... I said it's the wind! Gilbert... Leo! I don't believe it! My love, are you alright? Are you hurt? Alive! Thank God you are - for my sake! He didn't die! You lied! Who? Your husband! You're drunk. I saw him! You did? - His father! - Gaby? Yes, Gaby. He said, "My sors alive". He's never been so dead in his whole life! His dad's senile. Here, look what I brought. My passport. Don't doubt me. I had a problem tonight, but I did all I could to come. Because tonight, more than ever, I had to see you. I had to see you tonight. I see you've forgotten. I've forgotten? What did I forget? That you were wearing a single glove? And an off-white raincoat with one button missing? That your makeup had run slightly? As if you'd been crying a bit, but it was the wind. It was very windy. It blew your raincoat up around you. You looked like a white angel flying away. Now she thinks in her pretty little head that I forgot! I could have forgotten that 2 years, 8 hours and 26 minutes ago precisely, a white angel flew toward me? My love... Mom! I love you so much! I'll call you tomorrow when they've gone. I love you! Where are you, Mom? Where has she got to? There she is! Mom! Where were you? You've lost your hair. Where were you? You scared us! You're soaking. It's burst. Come on, let's go back inside. I'll stay with her tonight. We can't leave her alone. I'll stay with you tonight. He'll stay with you tonight. In cases like this, you want to die yet you don't! You want to drown yet you take a lifebuoy. Classic! You take barbiturates yet you set your alarm clock. You want to shoot yourself. The gun isn't loaded. You get it? Are you asleep? In Joinville-Le-Pont... Pont, pont We'll walk on the prom Prom, prom She did have a rendez-vous tonight. But why would she take a lifebuoy? I saw a motorboat sail away. Maybe it was a fisherman. Some go out at night. A fisherman? On the open sea! When she got on her bike, it was to meet someone, not to talk to her son. She had put on makeup in the middle of the night. Could she have a lover? My sister? My sister would have a lover? She said it was weird a fisherman should fish in the sea. - A fisherman? - The one in the motorboat. My husband was a fisherman. I can assure you they don't go fishing in the fields. Of course. Mrs Catherine said you were made up in the middle of the night and that was weird too. Thank God they're leaving tonight! I'm sick of being watched. Thank you, Nicole. Mrs Gratigny? What now? I must tell you Thomas is collecting sea urchins. Thomas... your son? Collecting sea urchins... Sea urchins! So what? Well, Thomas has seen "The Big Wave". Mrs Catherine and your sister have gone to see it. I think they'll talk to you about it. Thomas! Kevin says he's coming, but it's Antoine who ends up in her bed 'cause he thought she was there. This'll kill you! We realize she's in Fabiers bed! - Fabien, the photographer! - No! Fabien, the soldier who threw up on his chief. So, who exactly is in this bed? What a riot! I was bent double. It's the end. If I tell you, you won't go. Yes, I will. It sounds great. Well, Antoine and Kevin end up in the same bed. They're stark naked 'r all. Then, they stay together. And the Heatwave? The Big Wave stops stripping to sell sausages. - And that's the end? - Yeah. So, they call her the Big Sausage. I promise you I was bent double with laughter. Sure, I'm dying to see it. The lawn mower works, but it doesn't mow anything. It never did. Where is she? Mom isn't in her bedroom. - She went to get bread. - Bread! Where? At the baker's. You're crazy to let her go out! She's fragile. Seen her face lately? Mom, I was so scared. Why? I went... To the baker's. To the baker's. And you got sea urchins? Yes, we still have bread. So, as you're leaving tonight... - In fact, we're not leaving anymore. - What? - We're going to live here. - What? Permanently! I don't want you to be alone. If you do stay, the lawn mower doesn't mow. It never did! You can't do that. What about your studies? No problem. I'll study in Marseille. Paris was becoming unbearable. I'm going apartment hunting. Want to come? You, Michel? No, I'll do the hydrangeas. Yeah, go do the hydrangeas. Go on, tell me about the truck. You drive and I honk the horn! I can't believe she went to see this. She's been lying since the start. Walking the dog, Mrs Gratigny? You like being with your mom! I'm walking Rascal. Shall we walk together? No, thank you. When I lost my husband, I thought I'd never get over it. I was crying all day long. Well, you do get over it. Well, not always, in fact. But generally, you get over it. Of course, it takes time. A lot of time. An awful lot of time. And one day, you crave ratatouille. Ratatouille? For me, it's ratatouille. Say it's sunny or there is a good TV show... when I'm happy, I crave ratatouille. It's simple, but I love it. What about you? No, ratatouille doesn't... No, but what do you like to eat when you're happy? Grapes! White grapes! Don't worry, you'll eat them again. Those white grapes. Come on, Rascal... Let's go for a walk. It'll do us good. Then we'll go and buy ham. Good ham from Pigrenet's. A slice for you and a slice for me. Then we'll play with Melchior. You like Melchior? You like your friend Melchior. Will I end up like that? All alone, talking to my dog? I should talk to my son. Have some courage and tell him the whole truth. What do you think? You don't understand. They say dogs understand everything, but they're wrong. Cats are something else. In Val St Vincent, I'll have a cat. No, you'll stay with Leo. You'll go trout fishing with him. He loves it, in mountain streams. You'll get on well with him. We'll be fine there. But first, we're going to China. They say it's very beautiful. But before, I must speak to Christophe. What am I going to say? I must tell you the truth. I'm probably going to shock you. As for you, Christophe, I'm sure you'll feel hurt. But I've got no choice. You can't move down here. I'm hungry. I'm going to go to China. I love a man... No, listen! Give me that. There! - Has the baby been good? - Yes, he's in my bedroom. He just woke up. We went to the cinema, we went to see... "The Big Wave". My darling! Did you sleep well in this big bed? You mean the scene where they're in bed together, the Big Wave and Fabien? Fabien, the photographer. Fabien is the one who threw up on his chief. There she was, all alone on a bench, crying, Christophe! She was crying her eyes out. It was heartrending, I tell you. Heartrending! What you tell me is terrible. At home, it's not that she doesn't look sad, but she bottles it all up. Yet it's there. She keeps it all inside. There! She hides, so no-one sees her suffer. Like the elephants. Elephants go into hiding to die. Your mom goes into hiding to cry. You hide from strangers, not from your son! You're always a stranger, faced with somebody's suffering. How come you went to see a film like that? And you? Mom! What? You must know... that I'm here. Oh, I do know! I mean, of course, darling. Listen, there are no strangers here. You're not an elephant, Mom. If you feel like crying, cry! I'm your son, for Christ's sake! Cry in front of me! What? Right now? When you want. Now... tonight, tomorrow... Well, later then. I feel OK now. However, I need to talk to you. I have something to tell you. Actually, I need to talk to you too. All of you. You say that... you want to move here. I can't believe it! Are we gonna move here? I hadrt told you... I'm so happy! So happy! You're leaving Paris? I've found something. A small two-room apartment. Very near here. I wanted a room overlooking my mother. What family spirit! And I was leaving today. I'll stay a bit longer, too. My little boy will grow up in the fresh air. Who'll roam the beach every day? Who's gonna have healthy red cheeks? It's my Lucas! My little Lulu! By the way, you had an important announcement to make. I wanted to say... Thank you for being here. All of you. We'll always be here. You'll never be alone again. Let's go see this apartment. No, you go. I... No, I won't leave you alone anymore. Please, I need to be alone. Everything's fine. Let's go see it. OK, she's seen the film, but that proves nothing. - It proves you're biased. - She can't have cheated on Gilbert. Come on, hurry! How come the kid is hatless in this weather? Dad, walk a little faster. I want them to go, too, but I can't throw them out. No, I can't kick my son out. It's hard enough as it is. Help me instead of complaining. Of course, we're going to go away together. You don't know how I long for it. Yes, I'll come tomorrow morning. We'll talk it over. He has an apartment, he'll study in Marseille. Don't let him do that. We leave on Saturday. Talk to him. We just leave and I'll call him once we're there. I won't be able to tell him face to face. Be brave, Matie. Crimson once - red never again. Matie would rather go red again. I know! I'll leave a letter for him. But he'll never speak to me again. We'll invite him to our wedding. Well, yeah... We can't live outside the law. It'll be better for the child we adopt. I never wanted to get married, but I hadrt met you. So far, you've been my wife for the night. It's time you became my wife for life. - Is it very cold in China? - Very. So I need to take lots of pullovers. Come naked. How does he know? Better like this. I'll help you. - To do what? - To talk to him. Don't. It's up to me. 'Morning. Christophe! This is Christophe! Wow! It's Christophe! It's my son. What're you doing here? Mom, I... I came, because I... Not feeling well? Arert you feeling well? Come sit down. Come on! I'll get some water. It's because I didn't sleep. They say that this guy... They say you and him... It's horrid! You wouldn't pretend to me, you wouldn't lie like that. Tell me it's not true, I beg you. Of course, it's not true! I don't know this gentleman. I mean, I hardly know him. Why are you here, then? Why am I here? Why am I, your mother, here? I'll tell you. - Here. - Thank you. So... As you want to live here, I've decided to buy you a boat, a sailboat... well, there you are. So I came down to inquire. Sir, please! Tell him... Help me! Don't you see how upset he is? Swear it's all bullshit. Swear! I swear. You hear? I swear! They told you a pack of lies, believe me. I'm sorry. You must understand. You can see I have no choice. I can't help... having this little explanation in front of you. He is so fragile. I'm sorry. I feel a bit... Ridiculous? Yes, it happens. You imagine things, you believe them. Then, you feel... ridiculous. Ridiculous for believing it. Excuse me, I still have a lot to do. Bye, Mrs Gratigny. Come on. Hi, guys! What were you doing? Pastis, please! Same all round! Maybe she's afraid of flying. Maybe. I'll bring the rest. Join a bridge club. You'll meet lots of people. Good idea! You'd love it. You play bridge? No, card games aren't really my... I've made ratatouille. I love ratatouille. Or scrabble, perhaps. Scrabble is a matter of luck, drawing the right letters. I never have the "i"s for "kiwi". What about belote? Nice game too. Catherine's right, it's fun. Mom? I'm sure you'd like belote. What I did like was white grapes. - That's another matter. - Altogether. I liked eating white grapes with him. It's over. I let him go. Mom... You were right. The other night, on my bike, I wasrt going to meet you, but him. You thought I needed to talk to you. All I ever needed was him. You thought I was lost and I was... because I was away from him. You thought I missed your father. I only miss one person. Him! As I say these words, he's boarding a plane. I should have been with him. I lost him. All I'm saying is useless, but I wanted you to know. By staying silent, I'd carry on betraying him. Today is the day I truly feel bereaved. Today, and only today, is the day I lost the man I loved. What're you doing? She ain't coming back. Two years later... C'mon, Lucas. Not hungry? Bye, son. Let's eat. Looks good. I didn't get your card. I sent it, didn't I? From Hong Kong. - It'll come. - Thanks. It's an old boat. It was built before I was born. The boatyard isn't open to the public. My mother once came to see you. She wanted to buy a boat. I was there that day. Your mother? Anne-Marie Gratigny. I don't know her! A tall woman with light brown hair and dark eyes. Tell her there's no boat. I wish I could, but... What? Why do you worry if you don't know her? She is alright. At least... I think she is. Sorry, I don't see how I can help you. I miss her. Her grandson misses her. Another's on the way. I'm sorry, but I really don't see... She's gone. We don't know where. Abroad, maybe. Italy? She liked Italy. She left, because... she lost the man she loved. Yes, I heard about your father. She didn't mean my father. She just left, without a word? She said it all. That she should've gone with him, because... because he was her whole life. And she only ever loved him. Then, she picked up her coat and never came back. She wasrt that tall. Sometimes even, she seemed tiny. And her hair wasrt light brown, it was blond. You never much looked at your mother. That's why now... I wish I could see her. - Hi, Gregoire. - Hi, Nicole. It's so hot! Coming to Saturday's fair? Maybe. No country loaf left. I took a baguette. And endives. They go well with ham. And this is from me. Hope you like it. What is it? A woolen hat! Notice anything? Well, it's colorful. The same colors as the sweater I gave you last year. Lucky, huh? Finding the same colors... Oh yes, that's luck, for sure. Hope it's not too small. No, it fits all sizes. Let me see. OK, Sissi, I have to try it on. Oh yes, great! Wearing a hat suits you. I wish it suited me. "Hats don't suit you - gloves do." That's what my husband said. My Bernard was a real joker. Gregoire reminds me of Bernard. I met him earlier. He's always smiling. I like a man who's always smiling. Shall I do the endives for lunch or dinner? Subtitles: J.
