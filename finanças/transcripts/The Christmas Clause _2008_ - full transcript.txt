[Christmas music] - [Mom Narrator] Ah Christmas. Everyone's favorite time of the year. Those magical days in December when anything seems possible. [alarm ringing] Except if you happen to be me. - Give me back my brush. - It's mine! - No It's my brush, my brush. - Guys, guys please, please can we stop? [children arguing loudly] Just give her the brush Anna, please. Sophie have you seen my glasses? - Give it back! - Guys I said no shouting. - It's mine, give me back my brush. - Okay, you're not listening. Go, kitchen. [child shrieks] - [Older Child] Give it back. - [Younger Child] It's mine. - It's over there. - Thank you. Pancakes in five minutes. - Quiet! These last few years, Christmas seems like another sugar coated to do on my already bloated list. Women everywhere are expected to conjure their inner Marthas and do it all. Mommies / supermodels. Gourmet chefs. Of course there's the decorating. [baby crying] Doesn't it just make you want to sing? [baby crying] [Mom moaning] [Mom sighing] Whoopsie, there we go. Oh Annie honey, please. Put on your socks. - Toes hurt, toes hurt. - Yeah well nothing is worse than cold feet. [puke splattering] [baby burping] Except for barf on the Lasky brief and a 10 year old hooker. Okay sweet cheeks wash it off. Is that my heirloom engagement ring, Nikki? Give it to me. - But it's for school. - Go, wash, now. - I hate you. - Santa heard that. [groaning] Oh are those yesterday's clothes? Please tell me you weren't up all night working. - Okay I won't but I was. You have got to see my new design for the Community Center. It's, Soph I really think we've got a shot at this one. - Hallelujah. - [Dad] Oh thanks. - It's just that honey, I think that Nikki needs braces and my transmission's shot. You know it would be really great if you got this job. [sniffing] - I know that starting my own firm has always seemed kind of speculative to you, but look I'm a good architect. I'm good at my job. I'm going to get work. - Yeah you have one job, I have 10. - Excuse me? - I can't be late. Go on get your stuff. Alright you guys I cannot be late. Nikki, Anna, come on hurry up. - Okay listen, you go. I will take JJ to daycare. - No, no, no I have him, I have him. [sighing] - Soph listen, let me do it. - No, no, no, I have everything under control David. I'm fine. Girls, now, let's go, go, go! Oh gosh. - Come on sweetie. Love you guys. [horn beeping] [kids arguing and singing] - Okay. Anna just stop for a second please, thank you. - Can we see Santa after school? - We're busy later right Mom? - Oh yeah I'm busy. After lunch I have a staff meeting. I have the contracts at two. I have a deposition at four and I sure hope that Bob doesn't expect me to work late tonight again. - That's all, that's all you have on your schedule? - Mom I wanna see Santa. - Okay girls, we're almost at the front of the line. Get ready. - Why does no one ever listen to me? - I can sing for him. Jingle bell jingle bell jingle all the way - Please Anna anything but that song. Anything, I can't bear to hear it again. Okay. - I decided I want a puppy from Santa. Do you think he'll get me a puppy? - Mom, hello? - Nikki, my first born apple of my eye, gem of my life. What is with you today? Alright, girls, we're here. Get it together. Alright girls, come on. Let's go, go go go. Good you've got your backpack. Good go. Goodbye honey I love you. I love you, bye. Bye girls. [ominous music] - Sophie Kelly are you avoiding me? - Hey neighbor, no of course not. - Did you bring your cookies for the bake sale? - They're cooling on the rack. - It's just awesome of you to volunteer. I don't know how you do it, you Superwoman you. - Yay. [sighing] [school bell ringing] - So your Mom really forgot about the Christmas play today? - Yeah I even put my makeup on to remind her. - And what'd she say? - She called me a hooker and then made my Dad upset. - Whoa. What's a hooker? [ominous music] - They man's a donkey who says it's my own fault I signed a contract with no benefits. I hope this baby knows how to file. - You alright Claire? - Do I look like a whale? - No. - Okay. - You're beautiful. Oh my gosh. - Oh thank Hades. Bob is choking on his All Bran. Gosh did I miss the Lasky meeting? - They were early. I swear that woman gets up at five in the morning just to sharpen her horns. Here they come. - Mark, rest assured this firm-- - Quick, duck! - Will be at your back and call 24 / 7. - That man is vile, vile! - Okay look, I need you to print me up a new copy of this contract and send some cookies to school and rough them up a bit so they look like they're home made. You're an angel, thank you. - You're my goddess. Which is why it is with deep regret that I have to give you the latest. - What do you mean you're going to give the Lasky account to Chuck? My work on this file has been spotless. Figuratively speaking. - So when I climbed Everest last year I had the best guide in Nepal. Got caught on the peak, ice storm, 40 below, lost my pick. Sherpa saved my ass. - That's a beautiful story Bob, what's your point. - You leave work early several times a week. - Yeah well things have been a little hectic lately. - Well there's a major property deal for the firm. I just don't know if you're the right person to be up on that mountain right now. - Excuse me? - Well ever since you came back from your last kid, and believe me motherhood is the most important job in the world. I just think you may have lost your edge. - Lost my edge? I'm edgy. No edge. - We're making that push for the top. You gotta be able to depend on your whole team to get you there. - I'm here for you Bob. Look at me. Okay I might have a run in my stockings but I am here for you. - Oh come on, when push comes to shove what's it going to be? 24 / 7 with the Laskys or little Angela's got pneumonia. - Her name is Annie and she refuses to put on warm socks. - Not all Mommies can reach the peak Sophie. - Or the corner office. - Sophie, Sophie, Sophie. Come on, time is money. [knocking] - Come in. - Hey sis. - Hi. Do you ever call first? - More spontaneous this way. So did we ever decide what we were going to get Mom yet? - We were supposed to get her something last week. - Is this some sort of passive aggressive sibling order thing? - No, no, no, I'll get her something tonight. I've got to go to the mall. - No, tonight you're putting on a pretty dress and making nice with the clients. - My god the office party. - Any single men for me? - No. - Just for that I'm going to bring the mashed yams with the little colored marshmallows for Christmas dinner. - Oh I forgot I was going to host that. I volunteered. - After she got drunk drinking two shots of tequila at Mom and Dad's anniversary party. - Not a good day. - See ya. - Bye honey. [sighing] [metal clanking] - The chair, I know, I'm on it. - [Announcer] Attention holiday shoppers, there's only four days left 'til Christmas. Be sure to stop by our Santa's Village to get your photo with Santa. [upbeat Christmas music] - [Sophie] Oh baby please. - [Child] I'm going first, I'm going first. - [Sophie] It's going to be great. Everything's going to be fine. Would you guys stop arguing, please. Santa's going to hear you. Okay just stand quietly you're almost there. - [Child] No I'm the one going first. Mom said I could. - Hey Dave? Dave? Pick up the phone. My battery's dying Dave, please pick up the phone. I'm at the mall. I'm trying to get a dress and I need you to take care of-- [squealing] The kids because I have this office party tonight. Pick up the phone. Honey! [growling] - Sophie? - Marcia Wade. - Oh my gosh. What's it been 15 years? - You look the same if that's possible. - Well you look healthy. Tell me this isn't yours. - Yeah he looks just like Dave. My other two are other there. - Mom, Mom! - Get your rat nest hairdo out of my face! - Mom! - Kids, you ever think about them? - Well let's just say the men I date, we're not spending a lot of time thinking about babies. [laughing] I can't believe you and Dave are still together. - Yeah. - God we used to have so much fun in school. - [Sophie] I know. - You know, we should get together for a drink. Catch up properly. - Yeah, you still at Coltrane and Brock? - It's Wade, Coltrane and Brock. I took the whole thing over. [baby screaming and crying] - Oh well. - You'd better call. Martinis. - Not gonna happen. Here's your binky. Nikki, please. [baby crying] Oh that's good. Honey, it's time to see Santa. - He looks weird. - Uh well, no honey, come on. Over here. Santa is your friend. Don't you want to tell Santa your special wish? - Uh uh. - No? Do you mind? - [Santa] Come on. - He doesn't bite, okay honey? See it's okay. - [Santa] Smile. [shutter clicking] And what does Mommy want for Christmas. - Her life. [melancholy music] [twinkling music] It's your turn now. Come on. - [Santa] You must be Anna, huh? Come here. So what do you want for Christmas. - A puppy. - [Santa] A puppy? What kind of puppy? - [Anna] A little snowball puppy. - [Santa] Snowball puppy? - [Anna] Like that. - [Santa] Okay. Thanks a lot kid, Merry Christmas. - [Anna] Merry Christmas. - Okay um, I've got 10 minutes to drive home and then three minutes to shower and then try on this dress. Oh my gosh I hope this dress fits. I really do. Hey watch that, it's kinda hot okay? - You know Santa said I could have a puppy. - You know Santa sometimes brings other things. Come here. Santa brings other things that you might not have asked for okay? - Maybe I should have asked for a Mom who cares about my life. - You know you promised that if I bought you some hot chocolate you'd stop complaining for five minutes, alright? - How can I? This is the worst day ever. - Agreed. Keys, keys, where are my keys? Oh god of randomly missing things don't do this to me now. [keys jingling] Honey give me the keys. Anna, stop it. Just give me the keys. [keys jingling] Anna, stop it. Anna please. - Mom this is so boring can we please just go? - I know, look, I would send you to Venus and leave you there if I could, alright? Anna what are you doing with the hot chocolate? Stop that! [gasping] My new dress! Oh my gosh. How could you do that? How am I ever going to get a dress that fits now. [kids yelling] [baby crying] - You shut up! [baby crying] [twinkling music] Shut up! [thumping] [groaning] - Where am I? What? The furniture department? Or am I being punked? [TV actor speaking Spanish] By Pablo Escobar's mother. [voice speaking Spanish] - Slut, Margareta! [gasping] Your lobster cobb is almost ready Miss Sophie. - I'm sorry did I scare you? - Are you okay? You don't look so good. I told you, you're working too hard. I make you a nice herbal tea. - This is definitely not my life. - Okay, martini. - It's a dream, right? It's a dream. Woo it's a dream. Of course. An amazing gravity defying dream. [water gently splashing] Maybe I died and went off to real estate heaven. [laughing] Hello! - [Santa] Well well it's you again. - Aren't you that Santa from the mall? - How do you like your present? - Kidnapping and hair extensions. Very funny. - Oh I gave you more than that sweetheart. I gave you a whole new life. - You did this? It isn't real. I'm dreaming. I'm sleeping. This is a dream. Obviously. [gasping] Aren't I? - Nope. - Get away from me. - Listen lady, I'm just trying to do my job here. - And what kind of job is that? Where are my kids? Do you have my kids? Where are my kids? - Whoa whoa just relax. Your kids are fine, such as they are. - Okay what is that supposed to mean? - I was sent here to help. And myself incidentally. I got into a bit of trouble on my last job trying to make business associates disappear. See the thing is I wound up dead too. Bad boy, I know, but then this opportunity came up to kind of make things right. - Oh really and how is it right that I'm standing here half naked in the back yard of a McMansion I don't recognize with a pool cleaning Santa who claims he's dead. - You see once a year, the big guy outsources. Hires a few schmucks to pick up the slack, make a few wishes come true. So if I get this right, I'll be enjoying my dearly departed Ma's meatballs by New Years. - So you're dead and you need me to help you get to heaven. Could this be any more cliche. - Look, from the minute I saw you in the mall I knew you was a desperate woman. And you needed your wish to come true. Come on, could this be any more like what you dreamed of? Perfect house, perfect life, perfect uh... - Look I don't have time for perfect. I have shopping to finish, an office party not to enjoy, Christmas dinner for 23 and a husband I still haven't finished yelling at yet. [laughing] - It's good you haven't lost your sense of humor. You know I had this client in Chicago, he went absolutely postal when I turned his Ma into Joey Ramone. [laughing] - Okay I'm going home now. [sighing] [gasping] Would you just stop that? Okay I have to go home. - They're not there Sophie. - What do you mean they're not there. You can't just make an entire person's life disappear just like that. - I can and I did. - Well then bring them back. It's time for dinner. I need money for a taxi. Do you have any? Or is there a coach made out of a pumpkin outside? - No see that's the thing. I'm still working the kinks out of my return policy. - What is that supposed to mean? - That is for you to figure out. Otherwise... - Otherwise what? - This one could be final sale. - You mean I could be stuck like this? My entire family could be gone forever? - Afraid so. - You can't do that. - Sure I can, I'm Santa Clause. - No, that's crazy. Look... [gasping] [phone buttons beeping] Please be there Dave. Honey, please be there, please be there, please be there. - [Recorded Phone Voice] The number you have reached is no longer in service. - No. No! [crying] Not that can't be me. Anna, Annie! Dave! Dave are you up here? Annie! Nikki! Anybody? My babies. [gasping] [keys jingling] [melancholy music] [knocking] Dave! [knocking] Dave honey! Nikki! Anybody home? It's me Mom! [knocking] It's me Mommy! Mommy's home. - If you're looking for the O'Brians they're not home. - Barbara I am so glad to see you. - Do I know you? - Yes of course you know me. I'm the flaky Mom from the PTA. I forgot to return the bicycle pump last Spring. Barbara, I live next door to you. My daughter Nikki and your daughter have been friends since kindergarten, come on. - I'm sorry I don't know a Nikki either, and as long as I can remember the O'Brians live here. All nine of them. Do you need some help? - No, I'll just be going now. - Somebody's husband is in trouble. [water dripping] [sighing] - It's only temporary so I might as well enjoy it. [bubbles popping] Wow! [upbeat music] Oh my gosh, I am so tired. [laughing] [moaning] I feel fantastic. I haven't had a full night's sleep in years. Good morning. And good night. [groaning] [phone ringing] Go away. Hello? - Hi Sophie, the Laskys are on for 10. - Morris? You know me? - Unfortunately. Are you on your way. - Alright I'll be there. Soon. [groaning] Alright let's see what I have to wear. Look at this closet, it's all in order. [gasping] Oh soft. Wow. These are all mine. Whoever said a Kelly bag doesn't make a woman feel powerful was lying. [ominous music] [phone ringing] Hi Claire. - You know my name? - Yeah. - She's been pissy since you refused to give her maternity leave. - You look great Morris. - No, I will not work on Christmas Day. Did you get my message about the client party on Thursday? Oh and the travel agent called about Aspen and Bob is late again. - Yeah well he is the boss. - Yeah in his sad little Italian loafer dreams he has your job. [gasping] - Not all Mommies can reach the peak. But I can. I have waited my entire career for this. - I get it. Late night again last night with your Tony Robbins motivational tapes? - Don't you have something to do? I'm kidding Morris, I'm kidding. [weak laughter] - I know. - This is the life. Bob? Bob! - Sorry I'm late my kid has the flu. - Oh my gosh really? - No. - A lawyer lying. Bob, Bob, Bob. Time is money. - The Laskys are in the conference room. I think we've kept them waiting long enough. - Jake. - Good morning. - Margaret. Okay Ms. Lasky, singing the land transfer agreements. Here you go. - This land has been in the Lasky family for generations. Developed properly it could be our legacy. - Well I can assure you that this is my utmost priority right now and that this is my... And like I was saying I can assure you-- - Do you find this amusing? - Actually not and if you look at this you can tell that this is my priority and I'm on this job 24 / 7. - Me too. - Let's hope so. - Alright well can you open up and look on page one. You're absolutely right about those changes, I will make them and I'm sure you'll be very happy. - I will see you later. - Hypothetically speaking does playing footsie under the table in some weird alternate universe count as cheating on my husband who quite possibly doesn't even know we're married and might actually not even exist? - Come again? - What's going on with Jake Lasky and me? - You mean Jake Lasky the most eligible bachelor in the city? - Yes. - He's been after you for weeks. - After me as in after me? - Let's just say this land transfer isn't the only deal he's planning on sealing this Christmas. Way to score boss. - Hey! Hey you! Weird Santa guy, hey! [sighing] [melancholy Christmas music] I need therapy. A little retail therapy. [upbeat Christmas music] - Sophie, we've got that Tory Burch trench you were asking about. - Oh socks! - I heard she's seeing Jake Lasky. What I wouldn't give for that life. Come on. [sighing] - Wow. You come here twice a week? [laughing] That's fantastic. Ah there goes 10 years of stress. [phone ringing] Oh can you get that, I... Thank you. Hello? - Where are you? - I'm right where I belong. [imitates buzzer buzzing] - You're late for the Christmas wish charity concert. - No can do. I have a date with a memory foam mattress after my nails dry. - Sting is hosting. - What? Sting? Oh my god Sting, I love Sting, I love Sting. What am I going to wear? I can't go alone. Do you want to come with me? - No I have to meet my trainer. What about Jake. - Oh no I can't deal with Mr. Freaky Footsie. Not tonight. What about Marcia Wade. She said she wanted to go for a drink. - After you bankrupted her firm last year? - What? Collateral damage after our expansion. It was magnificent. - Oh I'm a slut and a tyrant. Did you have any luck with that list of Santas from the Bay Ridge Mall? - They referred me to head office in Jersey. - Oh, well keep trying. - [Morris On The Phone] Yeah I'm not even going to ask. - Jill, it's me Sophie. Your sister. Do you like Sting? Jill look at these shoes. Aren't they crazy? Look how high they are, it's insane. And this bag, it's got this weird horn on it. I bet it's really expensive. I wanted to show you these. Look, real diamonds. - You're festive. - Yeah I know well it's not every night I get to go out partying with my little sis in a limo to see Sting, come on. - You have to admit it's a little weird. I mean all of a sudden you're leaving messages and insisting we go out. - Yeah but we talk five times a day, I mean come on. Or maybe I think about you five times a day. Forgot to call? - For a year? - Oh god. - I can understand that you don't have enough time for me but Mom and Dad? - What? What is wrong with Mom and Dad? - Sophie, you missed their 50th anniversary party. - Yeah well I probably had some important-- - You don't need to make excuses. You know what Mom ad Dad are like. They're proud. Your career took front seat and they just learned to live with it. [melancholy music] [crowd chattering] - You know Jill, I'd really like to apologize for all the terrible things I've done, but I really can't remember what they are, so. Look all I can say is I'm going to make it up to you, okay? Oh champagne, you want some? No? Come on honey let's have some fun. [gasping] Look at this art. Dave would love this. - Dave? Dave Kelly? - Yeah. - I haven't thought about him in years. Wonder what happened to him. - Yeah I wonder too. - Do you ever imagine what your life would have been like if you hadn't dumped him? - Yeah lately a lot. - He's just such a great guy. - He is but sometimes-- - Are you kidding? Me and my girlfriends we were just so jealous of you. - Really? - Yes, he was just so arty and into you. Imagine it, you would have had like the cutest kids, big house, 2.5 kids. - Medium house with three kids. - Yeah right. - What? - I just can't picture you as the mother of three. The mother of anything. - Jill I would make a very disheveled but charming mother. A very good one. - You slay me. - It's true. - Sophie, remember you're a lightweight. - Not tonight. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen please find your seats. Sting has arrived-- - Oh my gosh. [crowd murmuring] Oh my gosh that was such a great event. I wish that he would have sang more than three or four songs. It was four. - You know I think I'm getting a little bit tired, so. - Tired? What is it, it's nine o'clock. - Club soda? - Come on. Three's dancing. Woo hoo, come on girl. - No no no no, Sophie, Sophie, no no no. [loud dance music] [camera shutter clicking] 'Cause I don't want nobody but you [crowd cheering] 'Cause I don't want nobody but you [camera shutter clicking] - Hello world! - Get down Sophie we're going to get arrested. Sophie! - Oh gosh who cares. None of this is real anyway. - Well I don't feel like spending the night in jail. - What happened to you? What happened to my fun loving little sister? - Your fun living little sister who has to wake up early in the morning to buy a Christmas present for Mom? Don't worry I'll sign your name on the card. - Jilly, Jilly oh Jilly Jilly Jilly flower. - You're so weird. You haven't called me that in years. It's almost like you're back to your old self. - I am my old self. This is not my life. It is not yours either. - You're drunk. - I love you. - Well I was drinking cran-sodas. Here please. [groaning] - Look honey, Jill wait. Can't we just spend the holidays together. We can do like we did when we were kids when I would let you eat all those chocolate thingys, you know, from the calendar. And then we could make some stockings and eat, oh that Scotch salmon from Nova Scotia is good. - I have plans with friends upstate. - Bring them all along. I've got a very big house and trust me I've got cooking for 20 down pat. - Maybe we can do something in the New Year, okay? - Okay. - Sleep well, thanks for everything. Drink lots of water and Merry Christmas, okay? - Merry Christmas. [sighing] [food sizzling] [phone ringing] [groaning] I love pancakes. Especially when they're burnt. - Since when do you eat carbs? - Is it always so quiet around here? - When you were dating that guy from the city gym, there was the sound of his expensive electric shaver he use. [imitates buzzing shaver] Though personally, I don't think it's healthy for a man to shave so much, you know, down there. [groaning] Hey Sophie, where are you? Hello? Sophie? Are you hiding? Where did you go? [melancholy Christmas music] [kids chattering] - Hi. Hi oh, are your hands cold? You should put your mittens on. Wish I had some. I'm sorry. [sighing] [melancholy music] Anne? Nik? [children chattering] - Get your roasted chestnuts here, hot roasted chestnuts. Merry Christmas. Get your roasted chestnuts here, hot roasted chestnuts. - You! - Hey! - You! - Whoa with the violence again. You know you would have made a great wingman. - You think this is funny? What kind of Christmas present is this? - Hey, you're the one that wished for the new life. - What good is a new life when the ghosts of your old life keep coming back to haunt you ever single day. - You wanted the Manolos sweetheart, now you gotta walk the walk. - Manolos gave me bunions in the 90s and now that I have kids they don't even fit. And speaking of my kids, where are they? Do they exist? Will they ever exist? And my husband? Just please, just tell me what to do to reverse this thing. - Okay. It's simple. You just gotta figure out what's really important. - My family, my husband, shoes that fit. Isn't it obvious? Oh please I would do anything to just see them. - Don't start crying geez. [children chattering] - Oh Nikki. - [Kids] I love you Mommy. I love you. - Don't go, wait! That's just mean! I have no more time for riddles. Just tell me what to do. - I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way. You have gotta figure this out on your own. You gotta dig deep, you gotta look for the soul of this. When it comes you'll know. You're gonna feel it, right here. - I screwed up, I know that. Isn't that enough? - Just start at the beginning, the answer will come. It starts with a D. - Dave. Okay the last time I was talking to Dave I was mad at him. Okay, so I need to find him somewhere and apologize. Okay. - Oh and Soph, one more thing. You've got 'til the close Christmas Eve to make any exchanges. Get your roasted chestnuts here, hot roasted chestnuts. Low in sodium. [light music] - Hello? Dave? - You're early, I have-- Sophie? - It's so good to see you. - Did someone die. - No, no, you look so great. - What are you doing here. - You know how hard it is to find a good diner in the city? There's one over there and I thought I'd come by and say hi. Hi. - Hi. - Um could I come in? - Um, yeah I guess so. This way. I'm just on my way out of town, so. - Wow this place is not like I remembered it. - Well when they turned the building into condos I decided to ramp it up a little bit. - You've designed buildings all over the world. I forgot how talented you are. - Well my favorite is this community center I'm trying to get built down by the water, but, you know, no money, monster hours. - And kind too, I forgot that. - Okay Sophie, why are you really here? - I thought that we could catch up, you know. Go over old times. - Oh is this some kind of closure thing because honestly I'm good, really. - Oh wow, gee look at this. Self-improvement. From the Inside Out, you working on that. - Yeah it's a little holiday break. - At a health spa? - Well I haven't had a vacation in years, or Christmas actually, so it's, just call it my attempt at one. - Oh god, we used to love to go away before the kids. - Kids? - Ah, look what I'm going to say is going to sound a little weird. - Go on. - What if I told you that we didn't break up in college and that we did get married and we have three wonderful, amazing, slightly ill-behaved children. - Oh you know what I gotta go. - No please let me explain. See I was having this really really horrible day because Anna wouldn't wear her socks, and Nikki, she's going through one of those weird phases where she's talking back and wearing makeup and then JJ was throwing up all over the place and I found myself at the mall and there was this really, really weird Santa and then I ran into Marcia Wade. Do you remember Marcia Wade? You know and she looks great and I was yelling at you on the phone and I'm really, really sorry about that. See this is me apologizing. Anyone up there? Come on. Any time now, come on. [fingers snapping] - You know what I should call someone. Can I call someone for you? - Look the point is I didn't mean for my entire family to disappear. I just needed a good night's sleep. - Okay Sophie I gotta tell you, you're freaking me out now. - I know none of this makes any sense to you or me but maybe it will some day. But the thing is in order to reverse this thing I need to find out what's really important to me and that begins with you. It all starts with you, Dave. You and me as a family. Please. - Why now, of all times why now. - Dave from the bottom of my heart I am so sorry for not trying hard enough and for making you have your office in the laundry room. - Uh hey, honey can you believe it? Sophie was just in the neighborhood and-- - Honey? - Let me fill you in since I'm guessing Dave hasn't gotten around to it. - Well I was just about to. - Fill me in on what Dave? - It's an interesting story. - Yes a tragedy with a happy ending. After you put me out of business last year, you know bankrupting my firm and putting me and my 25 employees out of work, I had a little time on my hands so I ran a marathon, took up crochet and reconnected with a few old friends from college, like Dave. - Facebook. - Anyway one thing led to the next and well, we're both still single. - Your mother's heirloom engagement ring, it's mine. - It's going to be a simple wedding really. Just us, some relaxing yoga and some massage. - You're getting married? - On Christmas Eve. - You love her. You forgot all about me. How did this happen? - Well I'm sorry Sophie but you and I, that was a long time ago. - I'm going to go to work. - Probably. - What? She just showed up. - Oh come on Sophie, you're the CEO of one of the biggest law firms in the whole city. Just get it together, just get it together. [crying and sniffling] Hi. - Hello. - You hate me don't you. - Hate is a very strong word. - Well I'm a terrible boss, I'm a bad mother, I'm an awful person. Oh god I hate this mascara. And those eyelash curlers, you know, guys could never use them. I'm a 60 percenter in a hundred percent world and now I'm being punished. - Do you want me to get Morris? - I just have to try harder. I have to start with you. What can I do to make your life better? - Seriously? - Yeah. - Well the whole maternity leave policy sucks. I mean how am I seriously expected to be back on the job two weeks after I have this baby? I need to be able to be a good lawyer and be a decent parent. - You know what, take as much time as you need. - Can I get that in writing? - Yeah, yeah, Morris will draw it up. - Wow, thank you. Really. - Call it new appreciation for the working Mom. [sobbing] [upbeat Christmas music] - So how is it that the new most popular girl in school isn't even at her own soiree? - Have you ever wished that you had a different life? [laughing] - Yeah like only every day. See, this is my happy work face. - Alright alright, I officially apologize for being a pain to work with. Okay? - What about my last employee review where you called me fat and said that if I didn't lose weight it would be bad for the company's image. - You look great. - I know. - Yeah, you know my whole career I've wondered what it would be like if I focused on the job instead of my family and here it is. I've destroyed every important relationship I've ever had. For what? 80 pairs of shoes. Time to put on my makeup. Big empty house. God. - Well if there's anything I can do. - Can you keep a secret? - What a fantastic story. A wiseguy Santa, lingerie and a fur coat. - You don't think I'm crazy? - Oh yeah, absolutely, but your story gives me hope. - Don't you see, if I don't figure out how to reverse this thing by Christmas Eve I'm in danger of losing my family forever. - Well for starters you have to stop Marcia Wade from marrying Dave. - Yeah but how can I do that. He thinks I'm crazy. He doesn't even know who I am any more. - Well then he needs to get to re-know you. Remember what he loved about you in the first place. Listen you took Marcia Wade down once, you can do it again. - But that was business. I don't want to take anybody down. Besides, we used to be friends. - Santa said start at the beginning. Your family begins with the two of you. Besides it wouldn't look very good if you just let your husband run off and marry somebody else. - You're right, you're right. I've gotta get to that spa. - I'll book you a room. - Do you think I could really win him back? - Sophie, you are ruthless, cruel and have fantastic teeth. I know you can. [car horn beeping] - Sylvia the car's early. Bye! [ominous music] Jake, what? - Would you mind explaining to me why you've not been returning my phone calls? - Well you know Christmas, busy busy busy. - Odd response considering I'm your biggest client and we made plans to spend the holiday together. - We did? [laughing] - You're funny. And after six months of sexual tension I'm not sure I get the joke. - Ah well um, here's the thing. About those plans, um something came up. I have to cancel. A family emergency. - What a coincidence. Me too. [upbeat party music] - Uh, I kinda don't remember that part of the evening. - Actually I kind of like this side of you. Makes me hot. Aunt Margaret on the other hand is a little less enthused. - Well she'll get over it 'cause she's old. - We need a distraction. We need to do something special for her over the holidays. This could kill the deal Sophie. - Yeah well some things just aren't meant to be. - Trust me a 50 million dollar land deal is meant to be. - I don't really care about money. [laughing] - Since when? - I just went to law school to make my Dad happy, and then I bought a house and I was supporting my husband's artistic-- How much money? - 50 mil give or take. - No. You're going to have to do this one on your own. - No way. You got me into this jam with Aunt Margaret. You're going to help me get out. We need to spend some time with her. Some quality family time. - Psst. - Not now Sylvia. Just one second. Why are you eavesdropping? - I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to dump Jake so you can seduce other man at spa lodge. - I'm not going to-- - This other man he know you're coming? - Maybe. - You need to do like Margareta on [speaks foreign language]. She bring one man to make distraction while she try to do sex with the other man. Like man decoy, hm? So other man not think you are crazy stalker. - Yeah that's a good idea but how am I going to find a guy in the next 10 minutes? You are a very clever woman Sylvia. - I want a raise. - You got it. Would you take my bags? [engine humming] [groaning] Look I'm sorry we had to drive all night but I still don't know how it's my fault that the limo broke down. - This reminds me of rehab. Why did we go to Palm Beach again? - Let's get Aunt Margaret checked in. Come on dear. [grunting] - Okay. No, no, no I'll get these. Geez. - [Marcia] I just thought it would be nice to have our parents here. - They won't allow your Dad and his cigars in here. - Maybe it's silly at our age to make such a big deal. - Yeah. - You've got to be kidding me. What is that woman doing here? Did you tell her we were coming here? Dave you promised me that she was gone. Okay, okay, you know what, let me handle it. - Five minutes and I come out swinging. - Okay, okay I got it. Uh let me guess, you were just in the neighborhood. - Uh yeah well actually I'm on a business trip. - At Christmas. - Family business and I totally forgot that you were going to be here. - So it was just a funny coincidence. - [Sophie] Hilarious. - Okay. - Hey girl. - Hi. - Your associate? - Client / boyfriend. He's rich and handsome and totally lusting after my body. Actually the real reason I'm here is 'cause I have to keep you from marrying Marcia Wade. It's not that she's not a nice person because I think she is really deep down. - Oh my god you're a stalker. - Yes, no, yes, no. The real, real reason I'm here is because all that stuff I told you about, you and me being married, is true and I have to reverse that botched Christmas wish and get back to my own real life and that all starts with you. - Sophie. - Go back, just, just back. - Look I know I wasn't the most attentive wife and I should have been more supportive of your career and I kind of let myself go. You think I'm crazy because hello, but I really have to try. I have to try really hard and I'm running out of time. - Hey. - Hi, Jake, Dave, Dave Jake. - Hey, I've got the key to our room. You ready? - Yes, okay. I'll talk to you later? Save me. - Who was that guy? - My husband. [grunting] Could you help me please? [electric razor buzzing] I can't believe there was only one room left. - [Jake] She really likes you, you know. - Oh who? - [Jake] Aunt Margaret. - Oh I really got that feeling when we were at the last truck stop and she ripped the Twinkie out of my hand. - She admires your independence. Me on the other hand she considers to be a very bad boy. - Yeah. - You see you're forgetting our deal. - Oh the land transfer deal. The contracts are right over there. - No our other deal. [laughing] - You know I think that Morris forgot to pack that file. - Whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait. How do you think your firm got this gig in the first place? - Because I'm a really hard worker with an eye for fairness. [laughing] - Guess again. - Because I'm a ruthless cow who's willing to sleep her way into the big leagues. - Look you get what you want. I get what I want. - You really think that's what it takes to get ahead? - Yeah, it helps. It's that guy isn't it? Who the hell is he anyway? - He's a really great architect. He's an old friend. Small time land developer. - Are you trying to screw me out of this land deal? Because if you are-- - Believe me I have no interest in your land deal and your inheritance. None. - You mean, you won't sleep with me just because I'm rich and powerful? - I would never sleep with someone to get ahead, okay? - I finally found a woman who likes me for me. Oh Sophie, oh Sophie. - Just hold that thought for one minute. Hello, is this the Bay Ridge Mall? I have a bit of an emergency. I need to know what time the mall closes. Or at least the Santa station. Okay, thank you very much. [phone beeps] [ominous music] Please don't hit me. - How dare you suggest that we call off this wedding? - Listen I know how this looks, and trust me you don't want to know the real reason I'm here any more than the lie I'm about to tell you, so why don't you just give me a few minutes to talk with him alone. - Just stay away from my fiance. If I catch you within two feet of us while we are here, I am getting a restraining order. [ominous music] I was thinking with the snow capped mountains in the background, the patio would be perfect for our wedding photos. And this room could be a fantastic place to have an intimate dinner with our closest friends and-- - Well this is going to be interesting. - Oh yes, flowers, we need flowers... - What am I doing? I'm just stupid. - I'm on to you dear. - Oh? - At first I assumed you were simply after my nephew but then I realized you're too smart for him. And so the question remains, what is it exactly that you want. - Oh to close the deal and all that corporate-- - Who is that man? - You know what, you wouldn't understand it. - Trust me honey, at my age nothing you could say would shock me. - My husband. - I see. - It's a long story. - Stories are in the past dear. What's to do about it now. - Oh I don't know. I don't even know why I'm here. I should be at home reading the Grinch, stuffing stockings, resenting my in laws. I made just a terrible mistake. - You know, wealth always came easy for me. Success a snap. But family, children, a man that I love, I didn't want any of that. Wasn't possible with my career. Heck I invented 24/7. But you, I think there's something else for you. You know dear, if there is something else or someone else who inspires you-- - There's four other people. But I'm afraid I might have lost them forever. - Unless you get that man. - I don't know. It's all I have to go on right now. - Well then go. - But you don't understand, I've been trying. Oh my gosh. - Oh stop your whining already. Go after him before it's too late. - Okay. You're right, you're right, thank you. Why am I so nervous. I've known this man forever. Keep it together Sophie, keep it together. Hey. Psst. Dave. - Since when do you do yoga? - Since when do you wear a matching track suit? - It was a gift. - I'm sorry I'm just used to seeing you in those funky old sweats. - Those sweats are a classic. - I know I just washed them. They're sitting there unfolded in the laundry basket. - Shh. - Okay. - Look, I also know that you just found out that you need glasses. [gong ringing] I bet even in this alternate reality you're trying to get your band back together. You know, your old band? Dave, you won't buy coffee from Starbucks because you think it's ridiculous that they call a small coffee tall. Now look even if half of what I say you believe, I need you to just-- - You again. That's it. I'm calling security. I am not going to let you get away with this. - Marcia, Marcia, wait, wait. [gong ringing] - Um, very relaxing class thank you. Ohm. - First she took over my business and now she's trying to sabotage my wedding, my kundalini, my life. - Dave? - Don't you take one step closer. - Look Marcia I know that you're upset with me and I can't blame you, but-- - Sophie's just an old friend who's going through a tough time. - Old friend, don't you mean old girlfriend who you still have a thing for? - No I-- I'm, well, I don't know, I didn't expect any of this. - Damn you Dave Kelly you've had cold feet ever since she got here the other day. - You have? - Just take this okay? Take it, take it. - That's my ring. - No it's my ring. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - It's my ring. - Excuse me. - Ah okay just-- [grunting] [metal ring pinging] [gasping] [whooshing] [splatting] - Get out of my way! Excuse me. - It is not I just had it cleaned. - Get back. - It's my ring and I want it. - Would you stop. - Where is it? - I got it, I got it, it's mine and you're not getting it back from me. - Give me the ring. - No it's mine. [cake splattering] [grunting] - I got it, I have it. [cake splattering] [crowd gasping] - No, no Marcia no, no. [grunting] No, Sophie, Sophie, please Sophie. [grunting] [cake splattering] - Is that enough for you? Did you want some more? - [Dave] Marcia, Sophie, Sophie come on. - Where is it now? - I don't know. - It's gone. And I was supposed to be on a low carb diet. [sighing] Hey. - Oh great. - No, no please. Come here-- - You can't be serious. - I want to apologize. Please, sit down. Honestly I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to make you hate me. I was kind of immature back there. Although you were the first person to hit me in the face. - I was. - We used to be friends. What happened to us? - Girl plague. You know that female competitive thing that kicks in somewhere between middle school and death? - I am sorry. I know you think I'm crazy and that I'm trying to ruin your life and I would explain my twisted rationale but you wouldn't believe it unless you were six and waiting for Santa Clause. - What is it with this time of year? - Brings out the worst in everyone. - I don't know why we do it to ourselves because I am tired. - So am I. - It's not the men in our lives, you now. It's that women want to impress each other. They just want to out Superwoman the next person. And you now what we really want to do is open a bottle of wine, sit on a beach, and thank god that we weren't born in the Middle Ages. - Yeah but the corsets were kind of hot. - Well. - This is the worst Christmas ever. - At least you got the guy. - Really? - Yeah, Dave still has a thing for you. He confessed. And I think you should go for it. It's okay. Weirdly, very weirdly, I kinda think that Jake Lasky's cute. - I could so hook you up. - Oh really? Happy New Year Marcia. - Thanks. - So what is it that you do when you're not breaking hearts? - I'm an architect. - Condos, shopping malls? - No not that kind of architect. I'm more of an idealist than a mogul I guess. Current project I have is a state of the art community center with pools and soccer fields and a non-profit daycare. Kind of like a place for parents and families who could never afford private. - Sounds wonderful. - Yeah and it will be as soon as we can find someone to donate the land. Quite a legacy. - Yes. Yes, it would be. As my father always said, the true measure of a man is not about the deal in hand, it's what he does next that makes him great. - Dave? Dave, I've got to go. - Thanks for the drink. - Hey, come here. I've got something to tell you. - I've got one minute. - Thank you so much for coming with me. - Well you were rushing around and we didn't really get the chance to talk to one another, so. - Yeah it was crowded. I can't believe that Margaret Lasky gave you all that land. - Well she didn't give it to me, she gave it to the kids of the city. What's something like that worth? 10 million, 15? Wow, Merry Christmas. - Life is full of surprises. - Yeah it is. You know Margaret also said that if I were to let you go I'd be a fool. Sophie, I don't know, I mean 90% of this stuff you talk about just sounds absolutely ridiculous. But then you describe that life and it sounds pretty great. - Well it's messy and it's noisy and we never get to sleep alone. Oh my god I forgot a turkey, I forgot a turkey. I need one of those that are already thawed out and those prosciutto things that you love and my Mom, and the Christmas tree. I wonder if you fixed the Christmas tree. Oh gee I have a deposition, okay I'll wear that black wrap dress. - Do you know what Sophie you have not changed one little bit. - What? - Isn't this exactly why we broke up in the first place? You always had something on the go. Honestly I think you woke up one morning and you forgot to put me on your to do list and that was that. How much time do you have to figure out this magical curse thing? - Oh god, just a few minutes. - I don't know whether to kiss you or have you committed. - Maybe both. Okay. Here's the mall. Wish me luck. Okay. - [Dave] Okay. - This is it. - Sophie I really hope you find what you're looking for. - Yeah me too, I-- Wait! [joyful Christmas music] [gasping] Oh my god I'm still here. That was supposed to be a magic kiss. I did everything you told me to do. I went back to the beginning and the beginning is Dave and I'm still here. Oh god. - Sophie what are you doing? - Don't you see it didn't work. I have to go back and find that stupid Santa. - No, no isn't it enough that I'm willing to go through this with you again. I mean come on you don't have to go on with this charade, okay. You won, you got me. I'm yours. So enough with the fairy tales. - It's not a fairy tale Dave. It's my life, it's your life, it's our kids' life. - Sophie, please don't go in there. Stay with me please. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Let me in, let me in please! Oh god, I have to try. I know there's a back door. Dave, wait for me. Santa! Santa please, Santa! Santa! Oh god. Santa. No. No, no. [sobbing] - So I got you the tree and presents for children, whoever they are. - Thank you Sylvia, no really, than you. - You owe me 78 bucks and I want time and a half for working Christmas Eve. - Wow, that's fair, you deserve that. And something a lot more. Here. - I have keys. - No, for the house. I want you to have it. - You going to take pills or put your head in the oven? - No I'm not. - I'll be out tomorrow. I want you to have it. It's not really my style. - I know. [sighing] [melancholy music] - Aw. [bells chiming] - You're busy later, right Mom? But it's for school. You're busy later, right Mom? Maybe I should have asked for a Mom who cares about my life. - Oh Nikki. Oh I forgot your play. - How you holdin' up? - My whole life I've been so worried about accomplishing everything, you know, being the best, being in charge, being right. I've been so wrapped up in my own race to I don't know where I'm missing the stuff that matters along the way. The things I should have taken time to enjoy like kissing my husband and really listening to Anna sing. Those little morning snuggles with JJ and little Nikki, that play was so important to her and she was too proud to tell me. Oh, how could I let it happen? How could I get so busy that I'm actually missing my own life? I thought I wasn't doing enough, but Dave had me all figured out. My problem has always been trying to do too much. - Balance is important. - Yeah it is. But it's too late now, huh? [melancholy music] What? - Well you see I just got back from a quick run to Vegas. This librarian who had a thing for the Cirque du Soleil, you know the dirty one? You think I'm giving up this easy on my Ma's meatballs? I'm still running on Vegas time, so this watch says we still got 10 minutes to get you back home. [gasping] What do you want for Christmas, Sophie? [bells ringing] - All I want for Christmas is my life back. [ethereal music] I'm home. [gasping] I'm home. Is anybody here? I'm up. - Mom's awake, Mom's awake! - Honey, you have no idea how glad I am to see you. - We got a puppy from Santa. Mom did you see our new puppy? [puppy barking] His name's Joey Ramone. Joey, come on. - Joey Ramone? - Joey! [laughing] - He's so cute. Honey where's Daddy? - He's in the kitchen. - Lets go. [child laughing] Honey! - What are you doing up? You are supposed to be resting. You had a fever of 103. - Oh my god how long was I out? - A few days. The doctor said it was acute exhaustion. - Wait, wait, what about the presents and the food and is my mother here-- - Just don't worry about it. We're doing a pot luck, we've got everything under control. Your sister's going to bring those yams with the disgusting little marshmallow things. So listen, hey hey hey. Go back to bed. I've got, I'm in charge, so go on you little control freak. - Oh my gosh go! - No no no no no. - Hey honey. - Hi Mom, are you feeling better? - Yeah I am. Look I'm really sorry about missing your play. - It's okay. It was just some stupid drama class thing. - No it wasn't. It was important and I should have been there. - It's okay Mom, really. - Look, things are going to be different from now on. I promise. I'm still going to forget a few things and I'm going to need your help with that but I'm going to try to just, I don't know, just be here with you and not wish my life away. - Mom, you are here. - Yeah, I am. - Okay who wants crispy pancakes? - Why do they smell like meatballs? Mom, do you smell meatballs? - Yeah I smell meatballs. - Mom, promise me you're not going to be one of those parents who quits their job to stay at home and then spends all their time bugging their kids. - I promise. - No no no don't. My 50 million dollar deal. Margaret Lasky just gave that land away. - Well, take this up the mountain Bob. - Resignation? [upbeat music] - So how did Bob react? - It was magnificent. - I'm looking slimmer these days don't you think? - So who's our first client? - Margareta DeSouza, some big time real estate mogul. [upbeat Christmas music]
