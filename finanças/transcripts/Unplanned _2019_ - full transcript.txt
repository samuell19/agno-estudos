Howdy. Hot out there, huh? - Yeah. - Why don't you have a water bottle. Thank you. Are you familiar with Planned Parenthood? I've heard of it. It's a women's health clinic, right? That's right. Our clinics are very important to our clients who depend on us for birth control, or abortions if they need them. Um, I don't know how I feel about abortion. My family is pro-life, so I guess I am, too. Oh, I totally understand. But at Planned Parenthood, our goal is to make abortions rare. Rare. What do you mean? Well, by making birth control freely accessible, thousands and thousands of abortions aren't required. However, when a woman really does find herself needing one, our clinics are vital to their safety. It's hard to believe that there's still some people out there that want to tell us - what we can and can't do with our body. - Yeah. You know, I completely agree with equal rights for women. And that's what we're all about. - So, what's your name? - Abby Brannam. Um, I am a junior studying psychology. Nice to meet you. I'm Jill. I work in community services at Planned Parenthood. And we do need volunteers, because many of our services are free or low-cost for our clients. Okay. Sign me up. ABBY: I left campus that day as a proud champion of women in crisis. So why didn't I call my mom and tell her the good news? - (protesters clamoring) - MAN: Murderer! Murderer! ABBY: Because I didn't think she'd understand how the work I'd be doing wasn't going to increase the number of abortions but decrease them. How's this for a brilliant insight: Never trust a decision you don't want your mom to know about. Hmm. Just keep staring at me. (sighs) It's okay. You're just here to check it out, and if you don't like it, you don't have to stay. (protestors continue clamoring) - Hi. Are you Abby? - I am. - Hi. I'm Summer. - Summer, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Here, put this on so everyone knows you're with the clinic. I'll hold this for you. So, really, is this normal? Just ignore them. When a client shows up, we head for the car immediately, so there's someone waiting when she opens her door. When she opens it, start talking right away. - About what? - Anything. The weather, her car, her clothes. Anything to distract her from the voices through the fence. They're gonna be harassing her. You need to make sure your voice is the one she hears. I'll go with you the first few times to make sure you get the hang of it, okay? - Okay. - Okay. We've still got a few minutes before our first arrival. Let's introduce you to Cheryl. The access code is 2-2-2-9. Uh, I'm awful at remembering those. - Oh, it's easy. It spells "baby." - (door buzzes) - Make sure to xerox the first two and file. - Okay. Excuse me. Cheryl? This is Abby. She's our newest volunteer escort. Abby, this is Cheryl D'Alessandro, clinic director. - Welcome. Nice to meet you. - You, too. - Let me take this for you. - Thank you. Samantha? Here, come here. - Put that in a locker for me, if you would. - Okay. Summer, why don't you keep an eye on the parking lot. - Sure thing. - Okay. Why do they all think that the women coming in are having abortions? Uh, you do offer other services, right? Not on Saturday. On Saturdays, we only do abortions, and they know that. Especially the Coalition for Life. - They're like vultures. - (chuckles softly) Their office is right up the street, and their whole purpose is to turn the community against us and to try to shut us down.

Does he know that you're killing his little grandbabies right now? Oh, here they come. Hi, Twinkies. How you doing? - Hey. Yeah, ignore me. - Hi there. Starting to warm up, isn't it? I love the color of your shirt. MAN: No matter what good things you do in your life, you're still gonna be a baby killer! All right. Look at me and keep walking. And all this because you couldn't keep your legs closed! Keep walking, basic! I'm talking to the baby killer, not you! SUMMER: Abby, can you get the door for her? Hey, you don't have to do this! Hey, get back here! I'm talking to you! Okay, she's gonna take care of you now, all right? - Thank you. - Okay. I need you to sign in here for me. Okay. The time now is 8:42. (man shouts) Okay. Your turn. WOMAN: Hi. I'm here from the Coalition for Life. We know this is a really hard day for you. We're here because we care about you. Hi. Good morning. How are you? - Good. - Nice weather, right? - Yeah. - Don't mind them. WOMAN: Your little baby already has a beating heart, and she loves you with all of it. What you're doing right now doesn't seem like caring to me. I'm sorry. Come on. (sighs) We'll just get you inside, okay? Just walk through that door. They don't understand. - Hey. My name's Marilisa. - (door buzzes in distance) I'm with the Coalition for Life, and we just wanted to let you know that we have other options for you if you're interested or if you want to talk. Damn it! They got one. I just wish they'd leave these poor women alone. MARILISA: ...feel safe and comfortable. - Elena, turn on the sprinklers. - Come on. Renee, call the police and report a disturbance. Okay. But the last time we did that, the cops weren't super thrilled when they showed up and nobody was doing anything illegal. The number you're trying to remember is 911. Okay. Yep. Yeah. Okay. (people shouting, screaming) MAN: Get the baby! ABBY: When my shift was over, I couldn't wait to get out of there. Hey. I don't think I've seen you here before. No, it's my first day. Can you tell me why you're volunteering? (sighs) I don't know if I'm coming back, so I'm just checking it out. Can I ask your name? Abby. - Abby. - Mm-hmm. Abby, you do know that they perform abortions here, right? You know, actually, I've had an abortion myself. So I don't have any problem with another woman making the same decision. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. No, it's okay. Really. It was my decision. No one forced me to do it. Well, if you ever want to talk to anyone about anything... God, do you people ever stop? These women are hurting. Why are you doing this to them? We're not here to hurt them or condemn them. We're here to help them. By dressing up in costumes and showing them horrible pictures to scare them? In what world would a woman run to someone dressed like the Grim Reaper for help with her crisis pregnancy? I am with the Coalition for Life, and they're not. So we can ask them to stop, and we do. But we can't force them to do anything. So for what it's worth, I think you're right, Abby. Doesn't help. Marilisa, leave her alone. Abby, get in your car. (engine starts) ABBY: Looking back, I'm surprised I admitted my having had an abortion to Marilisa. I'd never told that to anyone. Meaning I probably ought to take a moment to explain. In college, I'd gone from small-town super achiever to party girl in no time. Literally, from the moment my parents dropped me off. Mark lived in my building, and was ten years older than me. We started dating... nothing serious, until the day I saw two lines on my pregnancy test kit. Hey. It's all right. It's all right. We'll take you to a clinic and take care of it. What do you mean? I know a place, in Houston. How do you know a place in Houston? ABBY: Naturally, Mark didn't have the $500 it would take to "get it done." Neither did I. So I applied for my very first credit card. I kept thinking, "I can't tell my parents about this. "They can't know I'm having sex. They can't know I'm pregnant." I remember there was no one outside, but the waiting room was packed. (tires screech) My next clear memory was of finding myself lying on a table, feet in stirrups, with a painful pressure building in my abdomen. - (groans) - I could hear myself groaning, but it sounded distant. You're fine, honey. Just relax. ABBY: I remember waking up slumped forward, sitting in a hard plastic chair. My chair was one in a line filled by the girls who'd been in the waiting room with me. Some were staring at the floor. Some were rocking with their arms wrapped around their bellies. Some were softly crying. I was handed a few crackers. I slammed the experience into a box, nailed it shut, stashed it in a dark corner of my soul, and pretended it never happened. But I wasn't finished making bad decisions yet. Abby, it's not too late to stop this. I'll go grab the car, you slip out that door, and we will drive away. I can't do that to my parents. - Abby, your parents would be thrilled. - (scoffs) (Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" playing) (music continues over speakers) (quietly): Smile, Daddy. I'm trying. ABBY: To call our marriage a fiasco would be an insult to fiascoes. The last straw was a year later on Valentine's Day. - (sportscast playing on TV) - Mark decided we'd celebrate by making sandwiches. But later that night, after we'd gone to bed, he slipped out of the apartment to be with another woman. I filed for divorce the next day, anxious to be free of this man, feeling like I already was, until a few weeks later... (whispers): Not again. ABBY: Panic and grief overwhelmed me. I didn't want to be connected to this man in any way. - (sighs) -And if I were to have his child, I'd be connected to him for the rest of my life. So my next visit to the clinic wasn't as a volunteer escort but as a client. I never saw the ultrasound image. But the nurse practitioner told me I was eight weeks along, which made me eligible for a chemically induced abortion, better known as the RU-486 abortion pill. The cutoff was nine weeks. It seemed more private, less invasive, more natural. So I handed over $400 and took the first pill. RENEE: Tomorrow, whenever you're ready, you're gonna take the four pills in this little brown bag. That's misoprostol. It's gonna just gently empty out your uterus. And there's gonna be a little bleeding, but nothing more than like a heavy period. And, uh, if there's any cramping, you can take some ibuprofen. (bills thump on counter) Okay, you're all set. Have a nice day. ABBY: The next day, I did as I was told. I ate a light lunch and took the pills inside my brown bag. I was told I would probably start bleeding in about an hour. In the meantime, I made myself comfortable in my bed. A little bit later... ♪ ♪ (gasps softly) (groans) (panting) (yelling in pain) (sobs) (groans) (panting) (sobbing) (retching, coughing) (spits) (panting) (crying) ♪ ♪ (sobs) ♪ ♪ (crying) (crying continues) ♪ ♪ ABBY: After 12 hours in agony, I fell asleep on the bathroom floor. It occurred to me that this was the way I was going to die. I wondered who would find me. I prayed it wouldn't be my mother. NURSE (over phone): It's not abnormal. Not abnormal? The bleeding, the clotting, the pain? That is normal? NURSE: Use heating pads, soak in a warm tub, - take ibuprofen. - (scoffs) How could you not have told me about this? W-What happened to gently emptying my uterus? That is what I was told would happen. Look, I'm sorry, but I have another patient. (line clicks, dial tone humming) ABBY: Eight weeks passed. Eight weeks of blood clots. - (sniffles) -Eight weeks of excruciating cramps. And when it was finally over, my anger had disappeared, only to be replaced by self-Ioathing. Meaning I no longer blamed Planned Parenthood for everything that happened. I blamed myself. (phone ringing) It doesn't look like we're gonna get Dr. Plummer on Saturday, but I can call Dr. Wagner. - ABBY: Renee. - That sounds good. Give him a call. - Cool. CHERYL: Abby. Hi. We haven't seen you in a while. Um, yeah, I've been busy. Well, it's good to have you back. By the way, we have an opportunity I think you might be perfect for. - Really? - Mm-hmm. ABBY: Howdy. - Are you familiar with Planned Parenthood? - Not really. ABBY: So there I was, proudly waving the Planned Parenthood banner. And six months later, after I graduated with my degree in psychology, my cause became my career, despite the disapproval of virtually everyone in my life. The way I see it, the real issue is viability. At that point, the fetus could live outside the womb. But before that, it's just undeveloped tissue that couldn't possibly survive on its own. Abby, how can you say it's okay to abort at eight weeks but not at 24? Viability keeps changing as medical science improves. Are you saying that the measure of what's moral or immoral changes as medical science advances? What I'm saying is that I'm not going to apologize for doing a job that helps women in crisis. I love my job. I am committed to doing it. It is who I am. It is part of what makes me me. Take it or leave it. Fair warning, Doug. Dr. Dobson's book The Strong-Willed Child was one of the first books I ever bought. I still own it. All right, who's up for dessert? Abby, sweetie, why don't you help me? Thank you. You won't believe what happened this week. A woman came in with abdominal pain, and when we examined her, we discovered it was uterine cancer. That's nice. You don't even care. More than you realize, sweetie. Will you take these out to the table for me, please? (sighs) Okay. Right now, I need you to listen to me and not say anything. I know you don't agree, but to your dad and me, you were our baby from the moment of conception. I know it's not how you feel, but it's how we feel. You don't like where she's working? I can't stand it. But you still want to marry her? Oh, absolutely. - Well, ain't love grand? - (chuckles) (Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" playing) (music continues over speakers) (quietly): You're not supposed to look happier than I do. Why not? You got it right this time. ABBY: So there I was, making my vows again. Who gives this woman today to be married to this man? MIKE: Her mother and I. ABBY: This time with a guy who actually loved me. MARILISA: We do have other days that you can volunteer or other shifts if this isn't one that works out for you, but... Just one second. Hold on. Abby. Hi, Marilisa. Any sign of the Grim Reaper? - No, thankfully. - Mm. You look really nice today. Well, thank you. I am the new counselor. Well, I am sure you are going to be the best counselor they have ever had. Friend? - Fiancé. - Oh. (laughs) Yeah. She makes me come here. Liar. He was out here praying most Saturdays. All he did was change it to every Saturday. Well, congratulations, you two. I wish you every happiness. Thanks, Abby. ABBY: At this stage, between six and eight weeks, it's just fetal matter, a lump of tissue, not much more than a polyp or a blood clot. - So it's not a baby yet? - No, not at all. - And it can't feel any pain? - None whatsoever. That's a concern for a lot of women. And to be honest, it was a concern for me, too. But the one thing that all experts agree on is that, at this stage, the fetus can't feel anything. - There's still a part of me that isn't sure. - I know. Trust me. Nobody wants to have an abortion. Not like they want a new car or an ice-cream cone. But most of the women who sit in that chair already know that this is a pregnancy they aren't prepared to deal with. It just takes a little time to realize it. (sniffles softly) Assuming that you want to go forward, the procedure we'll be performing is called a vacuum... ABBY: About that time, Doug and I decided that we wanted to make worship a part of our lives. We found a church that seemed to be a good fit. But most Sunday mornings, I just felt left out in the cold. "For You created my innermost being. "You knit me together in my mother's womb. "I praise You because I am fearfully "and wonderfully made. All Your works are wonderful, and I know them full well." What's awesome about this passage is that we see that in-in the silence of the womb, God is still forming and fashioning people in His image and in His likeness. - Yeah. - I know exactly how you feel. I mean, I'm Catholic, and, on Sunday, I heard a sermon about abortion. (scoffs) I don't care what anyone says. I know that I'm doing God's work here. Well, you guys will never guess who knocked on my door last night. - Who? - (laughs): Shawn Carney. - Shut up. - Wait, wait, wait. Sheriff Woody at the fence? - That Shawn Carney? - RENEE: Yeah. Oh, yeah. - What did he want? - Oh, it was so weird. I open the door, and I recognize him. I'm like, "I know who you are." And he recognizes me, too, and he gets all bashful. And he's like, "Well, we're-we're just doing "this, uh, simple campaign. - (laughs) -"We're trying to get people to pray for an end to abortion for the next, like, 40 days." And I said, "40 days? Like Noah and the flood 40 days?" - Stop! - No! - I did. - I know. And he's like... - You are horrible. Oh, you would've said the same. - I... You would've said the same. - (laughter) - Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. - Yeah? How many doors is he knocking on? Try and guess. You can't. 25,000. - Where? - Yeah. Everywhere. Everywhere. - How is that even possible? - What does that even mean? - You think he's lying? - No. Kid like that doesn't know how to lie. - That's true. - (laughs) - Pro-lifers are so serious. ABBY: Mmm. - (microwave bell dings) - Cheryl, those shoes - are amazing. - I know. Thank you. - You really fit here. - Thank you. Are you enjoying it? Yeah, absolutely. (chuckles) You know what, I think it's time for you to take the next step. I'd like you to meet me in the POC room in five minutes. - Okay. - Okay. - Did you hear that? - Mm-hmm. I really fit in here. Mm-hmm. Do you know what POC stands for? Products of conception. Pieces of children. Hope you had a light breakfast. ABBY: In our facility, the POC room was the Holy of Holies. Most of the staff never set foot in there. After a surgical abortion, each fetus had to be carefully reassembled in a petri dish to make sure that none of its parts were missing. Because if they were, it meant that they were still inside the patient. By the end of the day, there'd be 30 or 40 dishes, and the doctors would have to sign off on each one. I want you to see something. Go ahead. It's amazing. You can see everything. Do you know what's happened with every other person who's come in here and seen one of these? The first thing they do? They cry. But not you. That's how I know you're the one. Very soon, I'll be called up to Houston, and someone will need to replace me here. Personally, I'd like it to be you. I'd be honored. Good. Babe, are you sure you're not pregnant? No, I am not pregnant. Okay. What makes you think that? Nothing in particular. Doug, I counsel pregnant women every day, so don't you think that if I were to conceive, despite being on the pill, that I would be aware of it? Yeah, you're right. Forget I said anything. - Do you have a test kit handy? - Yeah. For who? (toilet flushes) (water runs, stops) You know, we could take care of that for you if you'd like. (door closes) What?! Honey, that's wonderful! I-I didn't even know you were trying! We weren't. Well, sometimes the Lord just has a plan. - There's no chance... - Don't worry, Mom. I never would have told you if I wasn't sure. You're gonna be a grandpa. Ab? Hey, girl. Oh, we couldn't be more proud of you. And you're committed to carrying this pregnancy to term? I am. We are. We only have so much time, so much energy. If you choose to spend it elsewhere, there's less of you for here. I'm only telling you this for your own good. I understand, but once this baby's born, I promise, I am back on the pill, and maybe this time it will do its job. Look, I already warned Doug, we are one and done. So, in the meantime, do you want to move me to the lab or recovery? No. Don't you think it'll make women uncomfortable - once I start to show? - No. If anything, it will encourage them to abort. One of these was just administered in Exam Room 3. - Okay. - And this is from Dr. Stevens in Room 1. 1. Thank you. - ROB: Listen to what Abby says. - Rob, Christina, hi. Abby, I am so glad you're here. I really appreciate you helping us out with this. Oh, don't worry. We're gonna take great care of her. Hey, it's okay to be a little bit nervous, but there's absolutely nothing to worry about. - Here's a packet. - Thank you. Come on. I'll get you checked in, okay? Go. CHRISTINA: My parents are really pressuring me to do this. But what if I'm still making a mistake? You're not. Okay? High school is no time to start raising a baby. Just relax. The doctor's gonna be in in just a few minutes, okay? Can you stay in here with me? Sweetie, I would, but I am just a counselor. They don't want me in here during the procedure. The whole thing will take just a couple of minutes, and I will check in on you in the recovery room, and I promise you that everything will be okay. ♪ ♪ (audio distorted, drips echoing) Oh, my God.

No ambulance! - (crying) -No! - Cheryl, explain it to her! - No. We do not do that. We never do that. Think about all the protesters outside. You call an ambulance, and there's a picture of that in the papers. 911 calls are recorded. They can be made public. And there's no way in hell I'm going to allow that to happen. Yeah, but she could die, and then if she does... She is not going to die, and she is not gonna remember any of this. How do you know she's not gonna remember anything?

So it's taking a little longer than we'd like. - So she's okay? - Oh, yes, she's... - Everything's all right? - She's fine. (sighs): Oh, thank God. So how much longer is she gonna be? Well, the doctor should be in any second. The procedure only takes a few minutes, and recovery will be just a little longer. Thank you, Abby. I'll let you know as soon as she's out, okay? Thank you.

(whooping, laughter) ABBY: And later that afternoon, after terminating 38 pregnancies in the space of four hours, we spent two hours celebrating mine with cake and flowers and baby gifts. - Aw. - This is so soft, too. - Okay. MARILISA: Abby! - You're expecting! - (chuckles) - What gave it away? - (laughs) When are you due? - Thanksgiving. - Mine, too. Seriously? - You're so tiny. - (chuckles) Not for much longer. Think about how much fun Christmas will be. Is there any greater blessing than a new baby? It's okay. And I agree. In the right circumstances. - Good to see you, Abby. - You, too. (sighs) (chuckles) (laughs) ABBY: Around that time, Shawn Carney and his friends started their first ever 40 Days for Life prayer-a-thon. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there were people praying outside of our clinic. CHERYL: These are extremist zealots that will stop at nothing to restrict a woman's right to choose. So, are you concerned for your safety and that of your staff? Yes, absolutely. Violence is a real possibility... ABBY: Cheryl was beside herself, but I didn't pay much attention. I was otherwise engaged. (screaming) (panting) (groans loudly) Baby? Baby? I hate to tell you this, but he says you're only two centimeters apart. What?! (screams) Maybe it was a bad time to bring it up. Just shut up! Just don't-don't touch me. ABBY: And a mere 22 hours later... (groans) Two centimeters! ...I gave birth to a precious baby girl. - We named her Grace. - He's downstairs. He hasn't seen a poopy diaper in a long time, and I think now's the perfect time to show him one. Oh, he'll love that. (chuckles) Are you looking forward to being home? Yeah, for the next eight weeks, I am. Don't you think that child needs you? And she'll have me. Cheryl's being promoted and transferred to Houston. She wants me to be the director of the clinic. I would be the youngest director in Planned Parenthood history. It's not the kind of opportunity you just pass up. Abby, I don't know what you want me to say. I'm proud of your accomplishments. I am. But I can't pretend to like your choice of career. Have you thought about the fact that, as the director, you'll actually be in charge of the abortions at your clinic? Don't you see that it's different from counseling women about their choices? Sure, but now I can make ours the best clinic in the entire affiliate. And decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies. This is my chance to make a real difference. Mom, what's wrong? I guess I hoped that Grace's birth meant the end of all this. But, um, obviously it doesn't. ♪ ♪ She's not leaving. I have to believe that she will, sooner or later. No. (sniffles) She won't. She's got aspirations. (sighs) (Doug sighs) Babe, are we ever gonna sleep again? No. But you're the one that gets to get up tonight. (sighs) I get up every night. (Abby sighs) I'm gonna pray that if I'm not supposed to get the job, then I won't get the promotion. But you already applied for the job, right? Yeah. So? So you're asking God to show His will by stopping something that you've already set in motion. Why not? He's God. He can intervene. If I get the job, I'll know that it's His will for me to run the clinic. Whatever you say, hon. Good night. ABBY: The next day, I got the promotion. From now on, no more harassing the protesters or calling the police unless we've identified someone as dangerous. Wait, so we're just gonna give the anti-choicers a free pass? We're going to treat them with respect - and expect the same in return. - (phone ringing) And definitely no turning on the sprinklers. Planned Parenthood. This is Renee. No more letting them get under our skin or losing our tempers. We're doing a good thing here, and the best way to reinforce that isn't with words but actions. Okay. Okay, ma'am. Of course. Abby, there's a woman circling the block right now, and she can't come in because somebody's filming outside. This is the third complaint this morning. I'll take care of this. Okay. Ma'am, I am so sorry about that. My boss is on it right now. Are you getting everything? Uh-oh. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, Abby. I-I hear you've been promoted. Yeah. I'll understand if you're not anxious to congratulate me. No, actually I was thinking that the women coming in here will finally have someone who cares about them running things. Is this your camera? - Yes. - I need it gone. I'm sorry, but we can't do that. Sure, you can. Just take it off the tripod, pack it up and take it back to your office. Abby, we've been accused of a lot of things, some of them criminal. This camera is our best evidence that what we're doing is peaceful and nonconfrontational. Shawn, this is not the way that you want to start out our new relationship, okay? Just angle it away from the fence; that's all I'm asking. Can't do it. We need to see what's actually going on. If there's ever any question, we need it to be clear. Mm-hmm. Sometimes I don't mind you guys, but this morning, you're really pissing me off. And for your information, Shawn, there have always been people willing to defend basic human rights. First there was the fight against slavery. Then it was the people who stood up against the Holocaust. Later it was a battle for civil rights. And now it is Planned Parenthood standing up for the reproductive rights of women. Abby, you don't need to justify your job... I'm not justifying anything, okay? I'm just trying to explain to you... And you don't need to explain what you're doing either. The truth is you've just cited three examples of injustice: Slavery, segregation and the Holocaust. That can only occur when a whole segment of the population is dehumanized. And that's exactly what Planned Parenthood does to the unborn. Well, that went well. Yeah. She'll be fine. (screaming, shouting) What are you smiling about? You got to give her this. She got us to move the camera. (laughter) ABBY: Part of my job as clinic director was selling abortions, and I was really good at it. You know those guys who try to sell you time-shares in places you never even heard of? They had nothing on me. But, Jane, you're eight weeks pregnant. You've already spent $150 on an ultrasound. If I book you today, I'm authorized to credit that towards the cost of your procedure. But if you walk out of this office, then the soonest I can book you again is two weeks from today. And at ten weeks, the price goes up $100, plus you lose the discount. Choosing to wait's gonna cost you an additional $250. So, is there any reason that we shouldn't go ahead and schedule your appointment today? You take credit cards, right? Absolutely. Okay, can I put you on hold, please? Okay, thanks. I'm not doing this. This is all you. Hi. This is Abby Johnson. I'm the clinic director. RHONDA: Do you have a back parking lot? One where, like, I can't be seen from the street? No, I'm sorry, we don't. All of our parking is out front. Is there a problem? No. It's not that big of a deal. It's just that my family's outside the clinic praying. They know that I'm coming in today, and they're trying to talk me out of it. Okay. Um, how about this? Park as close as you can to the door, and I will come out and escort you in. Rhonda. Rhonda, baby, please don't do this. (crying): Pl-Please. Please don't do this. W-Whatever you need, you can come live with us. Hey, Lily. Hi. Hey, baby. (sobs softly) LILY: Why are you crying, Grammy? Grammy's just a little upset, okay? - Hey, baby, let's go inside. - Love you. Let's go inside with Mommy, okay? Mommy's coming, too. Let's go. That baby you're carrying... it's gonna be just as beautiful as Lily. Rhonda, think about the joy that she's brought us! Now think about a world without her! Rhonda, don't do this! - Rhonda! - Are you okay? Because if you need to talk about it, you know, it seems like you have a lot of support from your family if you decided to keep the baby. It's okay. That's just my mom. It's how she is. Trust me, I'm fine. RHONDA'S MOM: Please, I can't go through this! (door buzzes) - Rhonda! - ABBY: Fine? - How could she be fine? - (crying): God, help me. I was deeply shaken by what I'd just seen. (crying): Help me. Help me, God. ABBY: The family stayed and prayed for an hour. Then another hour. Then finally they went home.

Looking back, it was like a calm before the storm, a really big storm. Mention "Houston" and "hurricane" in the same breath, and people immediately think of Harvey. Not many folks remember Hurricane Ike, which is really weird given that, when it landed, it was the third most destructive hurricane in U.S. History. And what made Ike even scarier was that it was headed straight for us. ...where it will make landfall, but by Saturday, somewhere... CHERYL: Are you watching this? ...dealing with a Category 4 monster. You need to contact all of your scheduled clients and tell them to stay home. But we have 40 women depending on us. Some of them can't wait another two weeks. It'll be past the cutoff. Can't we wait a little longer before canceling? Mm, no. If anything were to happen, we could be sued. We cannot afford the liability. I mean, at this point, half of Houston's already packing up to leave. What if I bring in everyone early, I rebook the doctor for Friday instead of Saturday? I'll have everyone in and out by 3:00 p.m. Mm, I don't know if that's a good idea. We have to call all the clients anyway. And we'll give them the choice: Rebook two weeks from now or come in tomorrow. Do it. Thank you. REPORTER: Motorists stranded, major winds, and loss of power potentially for several million customers. - We absolutely cannot be here on Saturday. - MEGAN: Wait. Why? The building's solid, and we have a backup generator. But traveling is going to be impossible, with falling trees, downed power lines, not to mention the flooding. Plus, it's probably gonna be illegal to drive by tomorrow night. We need to call every woman on this list. They can't come on Saturday. I'm hoping to rebook them for tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'm bringing in two surgeons. We're running procedures in both rooms simultaneously. Everything needs to run like clockwork. We don't have time to make mistakes. Once the last patient is through recovery, we're gone. No paperwork, no cleanup. We bolt the door, race home, and hunker down. But to make this work, we're gonna need everyone's help. So are you guys in? - Yeah, I'm in. Whatever you need. - Yeah. - RENEE: Let's do it. - Okay. Then let's divvy this up and get started.

(thunder rumbling) (birds chirping) CHERYL: Our first order of business is to present Planned Parenthood's Employee of the Year award. And the award goes to... Abby Johnson. - Congratulations, Abby. - Thank you. And, ladies, I don't think it's any coincidence that Abby's clinic is the only one to be consistently on target on a month-to-month basis. - Well done. - (applause) Second, I can finally confirm the rumors that have been swirling around. National has given its approval. Gulf Coast will soon be breaking ground on this facility. - (cheering) - WOMAN: Yeah. - (chuckles) Wow. - CHERYL: That's right. 78,000 square feet of state-of-the-art medical center, making us the largest ambulatory surgical facility in the Western Hemisphere, allowing us to perform procedures all the way to 24 weeks. But we're facing some challenges as well. Three hurricanes in four years have emptied our cash reserves, so take note. We are expanding chemically induced abortions to every day of the week. Now take a look at the learning packets in front of you, if you would. And there you will find that each of your clinics are being assigned growth targets to double last year's totals on elective terminations. - Has she lost her mind? - Because our margin is better on chemicals than surgicals, with no doctors cutting into our fees, we are going to... Abby? Well, it's just that abortion has never been my main priority. Just look at our mission statement on page three. "To provide a comprehensive range "of reproductive health care and sexual health information through patient services, education and advocacy." That's what I'm committed to doing. So, if our stated goal is to decrease the number of abortions by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, then why are we being asked to double our abortion count? Why don't we turn to page four. Thank you. (clears throat softly) CHERYL: Abby. Frankly, I am shocked at the way you sabotaged me in there. Is this how you thank me for all that I have done for you? - Cheryl, I wasn't trying... - No, Abby, let me explain something to you. Fast food outlets look to break even on the hamburgers they sell. That's all they do is break even. Do you know how they make their money? - No. - On the french fries and the soda, the low-cost high-margin items. Cheryl, I'm sorry, but I don't understand... Abortion is our fries and soda, but somehow you've just decided that it's no longer your priority. Abortion is what pays your salary. It pays for your matching 401 (k), your four weeks vacation, your ample sick time. Abortion... abortion is what pays for all of it, for you and your family. Now, I didn't say anything when you decided to get married, and I said very little when you chose to become a mother, although I knew it would impact your work. But as clinic director, we are paying you to be a perfect instrument of corporate policy. And corporate policy is simple. We are an abortion provider. But we're a nonprofit organization. Nonprofit is a tax status, not a business model. ABBY: Can you believe that she humiliated me like that? I mean, I'm just standing there with my award, looking like an idiot. And how am I supposed to double the number of abortions? Am I supposed to go driving around the neighborhood, telling everybody to get pregnant? I don't think that would work. You're so funny. - Do you want a glass? - Yes, please. You're gonna need one, because you know what really pisses me off? What really pisses me off is that they are building the largest and most advanced clinic in the country so that we can perform abortions up to 24 weeks. That is a line I said I would never cross. Okay, pretend for a second that you're someone like me who believes all abortions are bad. What's the difference? Okay. First of all, if we do them really late, third trimester, it becomes a three-day ordeal. It's no longer a surgical procedure. It's labor and delivery. On the first day, they introduce a demise. - Wait. A demise? - Euthanize the fetus. They stop the heart by injecting digoxin through the uterine wall directly into the baby's heart. Day two, they induce contractions. Day three, it's the delivery, an artificially induced childbirth of a terminated fetus. Abby... you're killing me. Doug, you were the one who asked the question. Yeah, I know, I know, but... Well, who am I supposed to talk to about this? I don't know. All right? I don't know. All I know is that here we are, eight years later, and you're still thinking that you can change them when the only thing that's changed is you, Abby. Can you even hear yourself talk right now about these procedures? These are little babies, with a little brain - and little hearts, little fingers, little toes. - Doug. - Doug... - I just love you so much, I can hardly bear to watch it. (sighs) (quiet knocking on glass) Hey, you. You need a break. We... we need a break. I would love to, but I have a lot of work to do. You only get one day off a week, and I'm not gonna let you sit here slaving for Planned Parenthood. So, grab your things. We're heading for the most thoroughly awesome Mexican food on the planet.

I'll be right back. - (chuckles) (mariachi music playing, quiet chatter) One pumpkin ale for you - and a margarita for you. - Thank you. Guys, I'll be back in a second to take your order. Ah. Here's your menu. Pick you out something real nice, 'cause I know what I'm going with. All right, so then what are you having? Only the biggest, wettest, nastiest carnitas chimichanga ever to come out of that kitchen, - if I have anything to say about it. - (laughs) So, how about you? Mm, well, step aside, muchacho, because I am having... you ready for it? The chocolate caramel dulce de leche dessert nachos. What? Toast to that.

Come on. - The 67-year-old Tiller had offered abortions for more than three decades, performing by his own estimate roughly 60,000 procedures.

I'll be there as soon as I can. Corporate wants to meet with me. Abby, we've called you here to let you know you're being formally reprimanded. What am I being reprimanded for? You've been challenging me and my authority. You've become combative, disputing my directives, arguing and pushing back. I'm your supervisor. Therefore, it's your job to follow my instructions. In my eight years at Planned Parenthood, I have never received anything less than praise. I've not had a single black mark, not a warning, much less a reprimand. You just honored me as Employee of the Year. No one has been more committed than I have. SUSAN: Nonetheless, the reprimand stands. I'll need you to sign this acknowledgment that we had this talk and you are aware of it. ABBY: I know this might be hard to believe, but I went back to the clinic the next morning, more determined than ever to do my job to the best of my ability. Is that what I think it is? Afraid so.

Meaning most of the lives that you save, you never even know about. Which is why I need to go to the fence. Abby, I really don't think this is something you should be doing yet. But it's something I need to do. Hi. My name is Abby Johnson. I used to be the director of this clinic. I quit because my conscience wouldn't let me stay. I just want to talk to you for a minute, please just a minute. Please? I guess. (exhales sharply) It's always possible you're just here for a pregnancy test, but I'm guessing you've already seen the results of yours. Two of them. And you feel like your whole world is caving in around you, and you've never been so scared and alone. - (quietly): Yeah. - Yeah. Let me tell you what's gonna happen if you go in that door. The first thing they're gonna do is give you an ultrasound, but they're not gonna let you see it. Why not? Because they don't want you to see your baby. Then why do they do the ultrasound? Because the ultrasound determines the size of the fetus. And the size of the fetus, the skull in particular, is what determines the price they're going to charge you. (crying softly) Why are you telling me this? Because I understand better than anyone that, inside that building, they don't offer solutions. They only offer abortions. And if you go through that door, you will not come out the same person, because you can't. And everybody wants to pretend like you can, but you can't. Because the truth is you can let them get rid of your baby, but they can't get rid of the memory of your baby. And neither can you, no matter how hard you try. (crying softly) I don't know what to do. What's your name? Hannah. Hannah, it's gonna be okay, I promise, I promise. And I'll be there every step of the way. I'll do anything I can to help you. If you get in that car... ♪ ♪ Okay. (sniffles) ♪ ♪ (engine starts) CHERYL: Bravo. Let me guess. Former clinic director describes the mechanics of fetal dismemberment... You know what, Cheryl, that... ...complete with all the tools involved. That's not what it was like. You know what? It doesn't really matter. You've become a traitor, Abby. Some of us are still loyal to the cause. Some of us still believe in protecting a woman's right to choose. And those of us who do, we are a part of a billion-dollar corporation with lawyers and lobbyists and media experts on staff. Have you ever seen the names of our donors? Soros, Gates, Buffett. That's who we have. Who have you got, Abby? Cheryl, what you are doing is wrong. Is it? America wants abortion, which is why we exist and why we will continue to exist long after you and your newfound friends are gone. Oh, yes, I know all about them. Did you honestly think that we wouldn't find out? No one has ever turned on us like this before, Abby. Which is why national is going to make an example of you. So, congratulations. You've managed to make an enemy of one of the most powerful organizations on the planet. (crickets chirping) - (Abby chuckles) - DOUG: I love this patch. ABBY: Mm. Turn this way, baby. Do you remember what I was telling you earlier about what Cheryl said? It'd be kind of hard to forget. Yeah, well, now Megan isn't returning my phone calls, and her phone number has been disconnected. Uh-oh. Can we go now, please? Does Mommy look like she's ready? - No. - No. And you need to go get your ladybug wand upstairs. (Abby laughs) (footsteps walking up stairs) - You still up for this? - Absolutely. I am not letting Cheryl or Planned Parenthood ruin Halloween for our kid. Or you. - I'm serious, babe. - (spooky sound effects playing) Whoever created this holiday deserves a medal. We get to dress up, act stupid, and people give us candy. How cool is that? (Southern accent): You do realize they give Grace the candy, though? - (laughs) - Yes, but she knows Daddy's involvement is crucial. She's still new to this, whereas I bring decades of experience. (imitates pirate): Arr, milady. (normal voice): Okay. - All right. - Daddy, let's go! Can you take this one so I can call Shawn? - Sure. - Okay. Hold up, hold up! (pop music playing) (line ringing) - SHAWN: Abby? - Did you get my messages about Cheryl's threat? Yeah. We're being sued. We're both gonna need lawyers. Sued? Do you realize how serious this is? Yeah. And I just realized you're 100 feet away from me. Abby! - Hon, why don't you go ahead while I talk to Abby. - Okay. (whispers): Bye, pumpkin. Are you sure about this? Yes. We got served right before I left work. There's a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood, plus a restraining order to keep us from saying anything public. Yours will probably arrive on Monday. When were you planning on telling me about this? Figured I'd let you enjoy trick-or-treating and then give you a call. (scoffs) What are we gonna do? I've already talked with Jeff Paradowski. I believe his response was, "I'm in, baby!" Wait, wait, wait. The one that's on the billboards, pointing his finger, saying... "Get what you deserve!" Yeah. He's an old friend. Okay, um, you realize that attorneys cost money - and I just left my job? - Jeff isn't in this for the money. He's in this to help fight abortion. He's willing to cut into his Saturday and meet with us tomorrow morning. Abby, meet Jeff. Jeff, meet Abby. So, they're claiming that Planned Parenthood and its patients face imminent, irreparable harm from confidential information you've improperly disclosed or are about to disclose. That's nonsense. Well, they managed to convince a judge otherwise. Our preliminary hearing is in ten days. The attorneys for the plaintiff are a big firm out of Houston. But I'm betting we'll see some faces from D.C. As well. You're a big fish, and the sharks are smelling blood. Oh, also, you should prepare yourself that, uh, Megan and Taylor will be testifying to a completely different set of facts than the ones you've described to me. - They were my friends. - Emphasis on "were." Okay, Abby, I'm going to ask you a series of questions. Um, I want you to take all the time you need to answer honestly and think about them all you want. - Okay. - Okay. Have you ever revealed the identities of the doctors performing abortions at the facility either to Shawn or anyone else? - No. - No. You ever removed confidential patient information from the building, either physically or in digital form? No. Have you ever taken or removed anything from the building? Just an old vacuum cleaner. Uh, but the one at the clinic broke, and we had a tight budget for equipment, so I brought mine from home. But when I quit, I wasn't gonna leave it there. That and a plant, but my mom gave me the plant. Okay. (laughs) Uh, did you threaten Megan or Taylor if they didn't look to resign from Planned Parenthood? No. How could I? I wasn't even their boss anymore. Which brings me to my last and most important question for you. What aren't you telling me? - Nothing. - You sure? Because if there's something that you're hiding, I can guarantee it will come out in court. So, if there's anything that I need to know, now is the time to tell me while we still have the time to figure out how to deal with it. (sighs) A while back, curiosity got the best of me, and I pulled my own patient file. I couldn't resist. How come? I needed to see my baby. Is that a problem? Sure. For Planned Parenthood if they try to make an issue out of it. I mean, trying to paint her like a criminal for wanting to see her own file? We can only hope they're stupid enough to try something like that. So, what's our defense? - She's innocent. - (Abby chuckles) - That's it? That's our defense? - Yep. We are so screwed. Abby, don't complicate the issue. Look, the... their-their complaint's emphasis on potential future harm tells me they're light on actual evidence. Let me make it easy for you. They've got no case. You don't know these people like I know them. Planned Parenthood will go to any lengths to destroy someone that they see as a threat. Abby, there are two words in the English language that are very powerful if you put them together in court. Do you know what they are? "Prove it." (chuckles) Trust me. I got this. ABBY: So there I was, scared out of my mind. After all, it's not every day you take on a corporation with global outreach to 189 countries on every continent except Antarctica. Jeff looked like he didn't have a care in the world. Shawn was nervous, Doug was my rock, and my mom was... Shawn! ...well, my mom. Thank you for getting my daughter out of there. Wow. And here I was afraid that Abby was going home every Christmas for the past eight years bashing this evil Shawn person. Oh, she did, but I read between the lines, which is why I knew I'd love you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Okay, hugging is done. - Let's go kick some ass. - (Kathleen chuckles) REPORTER: What are you hoping for in today's outcome? I would like to see justice served, obviously, and for people to... ABBY: I just want to go over there and tell those people what is really going on. JEFF: Well, you're not going to. You're under a restraining order. Mm-hmm. So let me get this straight. First they sue us even though we did nothing wrong. Next they gag us with a court order. Then they hold a press conference so they can say whatever they want, and we're just supposed to stand here and be quiet. That is not fair. "Fare" is something you give a cab driver. The law is something entirely different. CHERYL: Sincerely regret being forced to take this matter to the courts. It's the last thing we wanted to do, but, honestly, our priority... Is it wrong that I just want to go over there - and punch her in the face? - Yes, Abby, it's wrong. That's my job. - REPORTER: Okay... - (reporters chattering) ♪ ♪ (elevator bell dings) ABBY: What is that? JEFF: Their attempt to intimidate us. - It's working. - Don't let it. They're just muddying the water to make it seem deep. SHAWN: It looks like they brought the whole firm. So did we. Okay, here we go. Something about your lawyer seemed familiar. And then I realized he's the guy from the billboards, right? Well, good for you. Looks like you really are gonna "get what you deserve." (snickers) (sighs) ABBY: In real life, sometimes things don't work out the way we expect. BAILIFF: ...in and for Brazos County is now in session. ABBY: If this were just a movie instead of the story of my life, then this would be the part where there'd be an epic battle fought on my behalf, full of twists and turns and a come-from-behind victory at the last moment. (crying) But that's not what happened. ABBY: Mom. And thank goodness for that. 'Cause I don't think I could have handled it. ♪ ♪ You guys do know we won, right? (laughter) ABBY: In the end, it only took Jeff 58 minutes to convince the judge that I was innocent. All of Planned Parenthood's lies and accusations counted for nothing. So tell me the truth. Were you ever worried? What? Me worry? I was sweating like the Devil on Easter morning. (laughter) - This isn't over. - Uh, sure it is. Did you... Were you not paying attention? Oh, and by the way, Abby told me what you said. And, yes, I am the guy from the billboards. So, Abby did get what she deserved, and so did you. And I'm the one who gave it to you. (clicks tongue) - (laughter) - JEFF: Okay. ABBY: And that would've been the end of my story, except for... (phone ringing) Hello? You're never gonna believe what I just found out. The clinic is closing. - What are you talking about? - The clinic. Planned Parenthood is closing it down for good. - Shawn, are you sure? - Yeah. I just got a memo across my desk. ABBY: Shawn was right. Planned Parenthood of Bryan, Texas, shut its doors for the final time on August 1, 2013. GRACE (chuckles): Bread. ABBY: To celebrate, we all decided to gather at the fence one last time. CROWD (chanting): Tear it down! - Ready? - Are you kidding? - I've been waiting for this my whole life. - (chuckles) CROWD (chanting): Tear it down! Tear it down! - (engine rumbling) - Tear it down! Tear it down! Tear it down! (cheering) In my hand, I hold two roses, one for each of my own unborn children who I decided to sacrifice on the altar of convenience. And I know I'm not the only one who's made that mistake. (sniffles) Thousands of babies were lost to abortion inside these walls, including one of mine. And today we remember them. We honor them. We vow never to forget them. So I'd like to invite you to join me in placing a rose of your own at the fence in memory of them, as proof that they are not forgotten. ♪ ♪ (sniffles) You know, I wrote a letter to you both. (paper ruffles) What it's about... the words don't matter. Because all I want you to know is that I love... I love you so much, and I'm sorry.
