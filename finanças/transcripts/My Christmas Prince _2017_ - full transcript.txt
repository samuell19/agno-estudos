a new endowment and we're going to create the educate nyc summer initiative program really well that's incredible i'm glad you think so because we want you to run it so i would plan summer school programs for every school in new york city we'll start with the bronx first and then we'll expand the other boroughs all i ask is you give me a three-year commitment and well you'd have to give up your summer vacation of course of course all right well take the holiday think it over and we'll talk in the new year how does that sound that sounds great thank you so much welcome thank you for

bodyguard it's just weird that we always see him and never talk to him well it is his job almost by definition never known a different to have a bodyguard before have you dated many diplomats no i

know maybe you could help me find the house it's 15 spruce avenue samantha logan's your girlfriend you know huh yeah so uh 15 spruce avenue actually the logans have a family tradition on wednesday nights of going to archie's diner so it was samantha's favorite if she's in town she'd be there you know she's mentioned it thank you officer i've actually never been more grateful to be pulled over not that i'm regularly detained for my driving of course let's go ahead and drive up two blocks up main street hook a left and you can't miss it keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road absolutely officer thank you cheers [Music] um i know new york has some of the best food in the world but give me a sandwich from archie's i'm never happier you've missed a lot of wednesdays at archie's the last few years i know maple falls probably isn't so exciting now that you've seen the world huh it's just different and how can we compete with that fancy european boyfriend alex i'm sorry i know his name is alex alex he's here honey what are you doing in maple falls well you invited me to visit and i regressed declining so mom dad this is alex hendricks jim logan nice to meet you my wife sandra welcome to maple falls i hope i'm not intruding on your family christmas if samantha invites you then you'll be our guest well let's all sit hardy are you all right alexander what did you just call him it's you it's really you how do you know my boyfriend this was not the way i'd hope to tell you this he's a prince no he's a diplomat from medellin you're prince alexander theodore william hendricks crown prince of adelphia aren't you yes i am i don't understand you said you were a diplomat i am a diplomat i came to america on a diplomatic assignment it's just that i i'm also the crown prince of adelphia oh your highness it is such an honor to meet you heidi how do you know all this i'm a crown watcher a what oh goodness there are crown watches in maple falls wyoming what in the world is a crown watcher it's it's a blog a website it's a community of people who enjoy learning about the world's various royal families what an interesting hobby i saw you at the anniversary party of king harold and queen sonia of norway well yes i i did attend that event and didn't you go on holiday last summer in portugal you're serious are you serious right now heidi why don't you prepare the check good idea yeah oh sure sure are you worried at all about security or highness because maybe we could get patrick to work as your security guard he's a police officer very smart responsible i mean samantha knows sweetie we'll be waiting at the register what sorry i just had to document this mom and i will give you guys time i apologize mr logan for interfering with your holidays it was not my intention as i said if samantha invited you then you'll be our guest you good kiddo yeah i think so thanks okay i guess the whole bodyguard thing makes sense now samantha i am mortified at what has just transpired when are you gonna tell me soon soon samantha i came here because the idea of being apart from you for even two weeks was unbearable i thought perhaps if i spent time with you in your hometown with your family i'd get to know the real you the real me alex you know the real me i'm no different here than i am in new york i wanted to see where you came from the place that made you well you because then perhaps i'd have the courage to tell you about where i came from about the place that made me who i am alex that's why i invited you to madelvia this summer it gave me time to figure out how to invite you into my life [Music] look i never meant to mislead you but when is the right time to tell someone that you're not who they think you are that you're not who you want to be you don't want to be a prince look i love my country and my family but i resent how much influence they have over my life it's why i came to america to be my own man to to make my own decisions apart from the crowd wow when i start telling my parents i was staying in new york was a big deal darling i am sorry for creating such a scene if you'd if you'd like me to leave i would completely understand of course i don't want you to go i'm just a little overwhelmed at all the new information right now okay it's it's a lot but i did want you to see me go false and you are here now and someone told me there's a hayride and a christmas dance that i mustn't miss can we figure out the rest of it later i think so [Music] [Music] jim aren't you worried he's a prince not an ex-word for sandra still it's a lot to take in i can't imagine how samantha's feeling wow hi mom hi dad your highness what are you guys doing nothing just welcoming your guest to the house please treat me like any other houseguest this is my boyfriend alex and for the next week we're just gonna treat him like that nothing more nothing less okay in that case alex made up the guest room for you and i better not see anywhere near samantha's room in the middle of the night dad what that's how we treat your boyfriends [Music] are you all right prince alexander alex i'm sure these accommodations aren't quite what you're used to your home is lovely mrs logan and i'm very grateful you've invited me to stay well we're very happy to have you i brought you a pillow and some extra blankets in case you need them thank you well good night then good night [Music] oh gosh [Music] samantha leanne what's going on i don't even know where to start i just sent you a link check it i'm putting on speaker i just found out that alex is a real prince wait are you serious is he there in maple falls yeah he came to surprise me and you got an even bigger surprise pretty much but listen i'm sorry i woke you okay i've just been freaking out and i need to talk to my best friend but you should go back to sleep or stay up all night researching prince alexander of madelia oh man i think somebody oh my gosh [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh [Music] my dear you're going to wear a path into the carpet this is our son we're talking about friedrich ma'am sir good afternoon felicia i assume you're aware of the problem i did see the crown prince of madelvia has abdicated his royal responsibilities at christmas no less to fly commercial to small town america he has chosen some friend over family and country oh yes that too that too what more is there oh dear i thought you knew that it's so much better you just get it out he hasn't chosen a friend over you sam from the embassy sam is a girlfriend samantha his security chief finally admitted it when i saw his highness had made five flower shop purchases since october but we always assumed he'd married clara jensen she's a baroness a proper match for alexander he can't marry some american commoner who said anything about marriage there is another issue this was posted moments ago [Music] over a year in one of the country's largest cities and he remains under the radar one hour in maple falls wyoming i can certainly see what drew him there what are we going to do with that boy he's not thinking clearly he could run clara off not to mention the damage to his reputation if it would put your majesty's minds at ease i could go and speak to him but in america of course anything your majesties require oh that would be a great relief and please remind my impetuous son that the royal model via marriages act gives us the power to reject any union with a non-royal don't you think you're being just a little heavy-handed my dear after all alexander is a grown man he's a prince first and foremost yes but even a prince can should meet new people and live outside the palace for a while it's good for him if you recall i uh i dated a bit myself while i was away at university yes and then you returned home and married me as was proper and expected i did and my love for you has grown every day we've been together [Music] morning good morning good morning youtube breakfast oh i thought i would take alex to bees bring me back her cooler he doesn't need a crawler sorry dad bye bye [Music] here you are merry christmas thank you oh samantha hello dear back from the big city huh mm-hmm with your royal boyfriend did you know that ellen weaver's husband used to play guitar in a big band everyone thought it was such a big deal until him i'm sure he's very talented ellen's husband oh b could we please have two christmas delights yes of course christmas two months trust me oh and a crawler too please in a separate bag right away brown noser so it appears heidi isn't the only crown watcher she's probably already told the whole town it's kind of her specialty is that what it's like for you back home why you moved to new york yes but i thought we were going to enjoy maple falls and deal with all this royal nonsense later especially when there are donuts now why is this a christmas delight try it [Music] cream inside tastes just like eggnog you said she loved that everything in december tastes like christmas after you finish these let's head over to archie's diner and get the best coffee in town sounds like a plan [Music] oh hello you're the officer who pulled me over last night he was actually rather helpful in finding you samantha hi everyone in maple falls knows one another well we used to date oh it was a long time ago not that long it's nice to see you patrick [Music] oh hi samantha your highness heidi hi why did you submit that photo to the chrome watchers website i swear samantha i wasn't gonna post it i knew it would upset you but the woman who manages the site said it was the biggest thing to happen to crown watchers in america in years it's all right it's all right frankly i'm accustomed to the attention back home but in new york it's it's quite easy to blend in this is all a bit of a shock to samantha um yeah i know can i get you two breakfast to make up for it on me oh no that's okay we just got back from bee's donuts but thank you okay oh patrick's here did you two catch up he always wonders about what you're up to does he oh look he's in my section okay i gotta get inside i'll see you guys later i mean farewell prince alexander i don't mind your american vernacular heidi in fact i think it's quite refreshing anyway we'll talk to you later thanks i gotta get inside [Music] okay shall we we shall [Music] hi dad hi guys oh how was bees it was as delicious as promised and you requested a cruller mr logan oh i already knew i liked you alex don't tell mom okay alex and i were just discussing we want a drama-free holiday in all levels oh good you're here what are you three up to no uh-huh i'll get that did you get it hello i do beg your pardon but i'm looking for alexander hendrix alexander theodore william hendricks crown prince of miguel via oh my felicia alexander the queen sent me for someone so concerned with proper manners it's quite rude of her to dispatch you during everyone's christmas holiday um perhaps we should take this inside felicia is it yes hello hi she's not staying alex you could at least introduce us i apologize you're right felicia holst this is jim samantha and sandra logan felicia is my mother's personal secretary i began my employ at the palace 20 years ago and i continue to proudly serve today and in exactly what capacity are you serving today felicia what has brought you quite unexpectedly might i add to maple falls wyoming well i'm sure you know but you've been spotted on crown watches yeah sorry about that turns out our old neighbor is obsessed with it i didn't even know what it was yesterday nor did i know that alex was a prince yesterday is that so most excitement maple falls a scene in decades yes and while it was disruptive it's certainly no reason to fly thousands of miles to come and check on me i do apologize for the intrusion perhaps there's a hotel you could recommend nearby the maple falls in is very nice yes alex and i could drive you there that's so kind i have my driver with me oh sure your driver and alexander i'd appreciate it if you'd accompany me of course it was lovely to have met you goodbye [Music] you're saying something about a holiday free of drama um something tells me it won't be that easy i'll be back soon okay i didn't even offer coffee or tea do they prefer tea mom i'm sure that doesn't matter they must think we're philistines i was gonna run an errand care to join me yeah sure might as well let's go [Music] this is a bit much felicia even for mother i'm sorry alexander but i'm here at the behest of the queen are we all yes but you haven't exactly been conducting yourself with all the dignity that the crown demands have you your highness you left your security detail behind in new york no one in maple falls presents any danger to me and please call me alexander especially here why are you trying to hide your nobility you've gone all these months without telling that poor girl who you are i love her i simply didn't want to scare her off and you showing up like this is not helping my job is simply to report back to your mother so i'll stay a day or two and do my due diligence samantha seems lovely alexander you have no idea [Music] okay [Music] welcome home samantha thanks gwen it's nice to see you shall i go get them yeah don't worry she won't tell sandra i'll be right back tell sound for what well your mother and i about to celebrate her 30th wedding anniversary should you guys never do fancy gifts well that's because she never let me we're always buying christmas gifts at the same time and she insists that i focus on you and the rest of the family so i'm making up for 29 anniversaries with these oh dad yep i should stop visiting them and take them out of the store but what do you think i think they're fit for a queen dearest you've hardly eaten anything i'm just not hungry i suppose what's the matter you seem troubled well of course i'm troubled from what felicia has reported you should be troubled too darling if this american girl is as lovely as felicia says she is then i'm afraid there may be nothing you or i can do about it but what about clara you will give up that easily on a lifetime of plans for a baroness to marry our son we spent a lifetime raising our son to be the man he is today we can't control how he feels maybe you can't what's that supposed to mean i may not be able to control how our son feels but i intend to level the playing field he'll you know what are you up to the math is quite simple if alexander's affections are torn between the american girl and a beautiful model v and baroness how can he make a fair choice when half the equation is absent you wouldn't dare it wouldn't be fair to keep clara in the dark delicious isn't it would you move there to maldivia madelia yes if only it were as simple as just deciding that i got a big new job offer last week i'll be creating summer school programs from the ground up for all the educate new york city schools oh samantha that's wonderful i know and i'm really excited about it it means that i'd have to be in the city for a few more years i don't know what that would mean for me and alex separate from the whole royalty thing it's crazy when you moved to new york your mother and i counted the days till you came back [Music] the longer you stayed when it was clear that you left it you were making a difference with your students we knew you were bigger life that maple falls could offer go live your life dad stop it [Music] now that we have felicials settled in uh please take me back to logan residence yes your highness and uh no offense ivan but i hope i don't see you tomorrow yes your highness [Music] clara dear i appreciate you coming the truth is i need a favor for me your highness i'm sure you know that the crown prince is on a diplomatic assignment in america yes it seems he's become a bit enamored of the place i know you've been expecting to wear the crown someday soon oh no ma'am i'm in no rush oh i just mean when the prince is ready then i will be ready to fulfill my duty which is precisely why you are the perfect person to go and see alexander a beautiful modeling jewel such as yourself is just what he needs to be reminded of his responsibilities to the crown and his family thank you you want me to go to america first thing tomorrow felicia will be there she'll take care of you of course your highness thank you dear that will be all [Music] thank you [Music] oh remember this one samantha insists we wait for her regardless of where she's living i have helped decorate the logan family tree ever since i was 18 months old when she fell on the tree and broke most of the ornaments that year i was going for a minimalist look fortunately we've had time to rebuild the collection you know i've never really decorated a christmas tree how is that possible what about the trees in the palace the staff decorates them all 112. [Music] and i thought we held the world record oh i made this when i was five maple leaf for maple falls it's one of my favorites go pick a spot just just put it on the tree anywhere anywhere this is the christmas i've been waiting to have well how did it go clara has gone home to pack she'll be joining felicia in maple falls you sure this is a good idea but alexander and clara belong together they're perfectly matched she's from a fine and noble family just like you and i were well yes we did get married out of royal obligation that's true but then we built a life together out of love we were very fortunate that our feelings for each other grew as they did but what if alexander and clara aren't as fortunate well but what if alexander loves the american and you're sending clara over there just to interfere in his happiness [Music] so this is one of your christmas traditions uh-huh in madelvia we have a 12-day festival leading up to christmas you see i keep telling you model via maple falls is similar well we have a gingerbread house to make you registered us you bet what are the rules here how big can the house be as big as we can make it excellent well come on let's do this i know what you'd like come with me [Music] here i brought you some eggnog remind me again what eggnog is oh eggs cream brandy and nutmeg lovely so felicia i take it that your being here means that alex's mother the queen is not happy about alex's relationship with my samantha it's nothing against your daughter specifically i understand alex has been nothing if not polite i know that he cares for samantha but do you have objections to alexander i have reservations but he's a prince yes exactly he's a prince and they grew up in very different worlds and his world is very far away house cabin and that failed attempt of the ski shower never tackled the gingerbread palace well we never had an expert before we had a boat well it depends is our palace baroque moorish revival neoclassical wow look at this i am so happy to see you embracing your heritage alexander patrick you're a judge they said they needed to volunteer from the station you remember what a skilled builder patch was he helped us a few times dad so long ago well it looks great this year your design i assume i guess you could say that okay well palace is gonna build itself come on focus focus focus merry christmas merry christmas patrick jim sandra merry christmas [Music] i think we're may i have everybody's attention please thank you guys for a festive day and merry christmas to all this year's winner of the gingerbread house competition is [Music] jim and samantha logan with alex [Music] your highness what brings you to maple falls are you looking for a princess ivan okay i don't think your mother's going to be very happy with either of us [Music] come again anytime you're always welcome thank you i hope i didn't interfere with your visit oh no not at all it's been so nice to finally meet someone from alex's life samantha you carry yourself with grace it will serve you well thank you felicia please tell mother i'll speak with her later oh hi leanne oh my gosh what are you doing here i decided i was crazy to turn down your invitation you sounded like you needed a friend [Music] perhaps i should see the guest room to leanne i'll have ivan bring me to the end no no leanne and i can share i'm sure felicia would prefer it he's right their majesties would prefer that he be with a member of his security detail that'll be best for everyone well if you're sure i'll grab my things when did you decide last night yes i'm so glad you came [Music] [Music] this trip was meant to bring us closer but it's turned into a veritable circus despite my best efforts and scaring her away i can just feel it it's true you'll weather many differences with samantha uh very different families distance of thousands of miles the royal modeling marriages act exactly ivan will drive me to the airport and then come back and stay with you i'll see you soon felicia goodbye your hands ivan shall we go call for you thank you hello this is felicia your majesty i see yes i understand yes goodbye it seems clara jensen is on her way to maple falls clara you'd better go check us back in right away miss horst when i first found out i was like how can i do this how can i be with him you know a prince like how would that even work and then we went on a walk and it was still just alex just me and alex plus crown watchers and maple falls paparazzi yeah i am used to small town gossip but this what are you gonna do go to the hay ride tomorrow like i do every year and well i guess we're just gonna have to wait and see ah yup it'll be fine [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] so [Music] this is our table now hi love hi donnie i've missed you too you look gorgeous oh gosh it seems that our quiet holidays become a bit noisy hasn't it positively cacophonous shall we enjoy this moment of solitude then we shall i see you've gotten more christmas delights you can't introduce a man to something like that and expect him to enjoy it just once maybe royal but i'm still only here oh yes excuse me please don't miss the annual hair ride see you there excited for the hayride yes i just wish i could be sure that that reporter from the maple falls gazette won't be there or heidi and her fellow crown watchers samantha i i don't have to go i can return to new york today if it would make you more comfortable no if we stay together this is what it would be like right a lot of unwanted attention yes often look i know it's a lot to ask i want to try really today let's use the hayride as a sort of dry run the whole town will be there everybody knows that you're here already so they'll be expecting you us so fine let's just go and we'll address your subjects in maple falls that's one way of putting it [Music] [Music] may i come in of course prince alexander seems not to be in his room i'd appreciate it if you'd let me properly announce your arrival he's not expecting you clara so if he seems a little surprised please don't interpret that to mean that he's not pleased all right merry christmas merry christmas sir [Music] felicia what are you still doing here um i thought this was your room it is it is but um i was inspecting this room because i heard it was bigger felicia you're supposed to be in madelvia by now yes well there's been a delay what do you mean by a delay my duties to the queen required that i stay i just made things right with samantha this morning she wants us to go to this christmas event the hayride and she's prepared to deal with any unwanted tension from press or intrusive locals oh really she's making such an effort felicia to understand my life i don't want to ruin anything it's not up to you to protect her you have to be honest about who you are and what your life is like so that she can make an informed decision she's not buying a car or researching graduate schools she's deciding if she wants if she can be with me well what better time to make a careful decision than now [Music] this is it the annual maple falls christmas hayride it is magnificent oh let's get some hot cider keep us warm for the hayride this is amazing glad you like it [Music] actually make that two i bet officer rose sweden could really just pick me up working the hay right now you got it two dollars thank you hello three ciders please make that just two before i commit to cider what are my other options here um we got hot chocolate reindeer munch what is reindeer munch um that is popcorn marshmallows and red and green chocolate candies then what am i doing in this line bye-bye oh your highness thanks because you were really good in the christmas spirit huh hi heidi you know you might want to tell him how you feel him who officer of sweden i don't we're just friends heidi i've only met you a couple of times and you've never failed to mention him ah in my experience taking a risk for the one you love is well worth it well if i ever need that advice i'll be sure to use it thank you two ciders what oh nothing just completely wonderful as all here you go you know i can get used to this cheers ready for the hay ride absolutely [Music] lately seems like every day feels like christmas eve [Music] underneath the mistletoe oh won't you spend christmas here with me now frosty's got his magic hat and rudolph has his shiny nose but i've got you to keep me warm while they're stuck in the snow i say oh [Music] won't you spend christmas here and spend christmas oh we have to wait in line for a ticket well that's what we'll do okay is that felicia [Music] just give me a moment darling alex clara jensen what in the world i'm sorry johannes no i am sorry for being so rude it is lovely if unexpected to see you again i'm sorry who is clara samantha logan please meet baroness clara jensen of madelvia whoa whoa whoa no photos no photographs so now there's a prince and a baroness in maple falls and you are samantha just plain samantha a friend of alex yes you could say that if you'll please excuse us [Music] something's wrong my mother must have sent her your mother sent a beautiful young baroness to my hometown at christmas i know it's unorthodox who is she too alex i've known clara since we were children she's also of a royal lineage my mother has always hoped to see us married prince alexander uh how long have you been engaged for did your girlfriend and your fiance know about one another samantha i'm not engaged i knew nothing of this i have to go samantha all right come on now that's enough samantha as i said he wasn't expecting you samantha please stop please forgive me i didn't know clara would be here i haven't seen her in years alex i believe you but it doesn't matter okay your mother is very clearly invested in you marrying a royal and she knows that you're here with me now and obviously not very happy about it she doesn't know you she's stubborn and accustomed to getting what she wants what about what i want you're expected to go back to nadal eventually maybe even sooner than you want and apparently to marry barrett s i want to take that job in new york i want a boyfriend that doesn't have to alienate his entire family and country in order to love me samantha no i'm sorry i don't want it to be this hard [Music] know the cliche that all little girls want to grow up and be princesses well samantha never wanted to be a princess just want to make the world a better place she loves you about the crowd mr logan i would do anything anything because that's the point alex sometimes in love and life you just have to make very real sacrifices [Music] room service i didn't told her anything sir it's my job to deliver it thank you young man alexander sit by me you must eat you betrayed me felicia i understand how you would think that you ambushed the woman i love in her own hometown and made her think i'd been disloyal it was my duty to the queen to carry out her request and she requested that i present clara to you as it were a text message perhaps a private meeting you told me samantha was quite prepared to deal with any unwanted attention did you not felicia a royal life is not for the faint of heart and a commoner an american at that would be even less prepared for it you and samantha have to decide how much you're willing to accept and endure for one another clara is a lovely girl who understands fully what is expected of her you now have to decide whether you're willing to do what's expected of you [Music] now eat sometimes things just still work out right i'll be okay something fatal just got my heart broken right happens to people every day probably not by a prince and a secret baroness but yeah it happens every day what do you want to do about the dance tomorrow i wouldn't miss it it's not a maple falls christmas without it plus it's your anniversary 30 years you still have a lot to celebrate right right of course sweetie definitely [Music] [Music] ugh i thought i heard you up morning what is this oh sam prince charming is prince cheating native maple falzian caught in royal love triangle are you okay leanne what if he goes and marries that beautiful baroness then he'll be far away in adelphia and you'll be in new york city with your new awesome job and your awesome roommate

through please mother father hello my boy alexander we're so looking forward to seeing you tomorrow i considered not coming mother i could get off the plane when it refuels in new york you know but i realize it's important you and i talk face to face and what is it you wish to discuss i am expected to ascend the throne correct well yes we're not going to live forever that's true because i cannot and will not govern medal via if i do not have jurisdiction over my life and whom i love alexander remember the model via national motto honor thy crown i'll see you soon mother alexander oh well i suppose we must ask ourselves whether we want him to honor thy crown or live up to it i always thought it was one and the same or perhaps it's not that simple perhaps it's not because alexander has just shown himself to be the king he can and will be [Music] wherever you go i wanna be there [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] clara were you raised knowing you would be matched with me well of course there are no promises we're not betrothed sort of uh consideration throughout my education and etiquette lessons growing up i i want you to know how sorry i am that you've been treated like this ferreted out here away from your family and at christmas no less all under the misapprehension that i love someone else clara the queen does not approve and she used you to try to get between samantha and me i may have lost her forever but that doesn't mean that i can marry you you deserve we both deserve to be with someone we love [Music] thank you your highness what do you mean i'm not cut out to be a princess i don't care for a lot of attention and your mother terrifies me and then there's felix felix a young man i went to school with so fond of him but my parents began telling everyone that we were supposed to be married so felix is too afraid to even speak to me i'll go and ask him on a date i wish you nothing but happiness at least one of us gets a happy ending right thank you [Music] we're gonna be late [Music] oh honey you look beautiful thanks how you holding up well let's just say i look a whole lot better than i feel i'll be okay oh oh is leanne ready uh almost before she comes down i want to give you something sandra with everything going on we haven't paid attention the fact that today's our anniversary oh jim we never made a fuss over our anniversary exactly fuss is long overdue [Music] day you married me was the happiest day of my life when i think about what might have happened if you changed your mind if i hadn't spent my life with my best friend if we hadn't had our beautiful daughter i am so grateful that you took a chance on us my only regret was that i married you over christmas which gave you an excuse to insist that i not shower you with gifts in honor of our special day so in the hope that this makes up for 29 anniversary presents that i didn't do justice they're stunning did you know about this happy anniversary you guys i'm here i'm here wonderful then let's get going [Music] day i'll have what they have right right so you [Music] thank you ivan a pleasure i understand why mother did what she did she believes she knows what's best for you and she lives and dies by the medallion national motto but i don't know if i can the royal model via marriages act says that samantha isn't fit to be royal but am i fit is it wrong that i should want to honour my own wishes to live with integrity and not just out of obligation must it be one or the other couldn't you modernize the monarchy isn't that what a progressive leader does [Music] wow you guys weren't kidding me [Music] here to dance dear i thought you'd never ask are you gonna dance with me lee you'll have another dance partner someday you know that right yeah i just missed the old one meaning a while the even older one is headed this way i'll give you a minute hey howdy listen patrick thank you again for what you did yesterday i mean that scene was awful yeah i was just doing my job yeah of course i but still samantha i i just want what's best for you samantha oh hi patrick heidi i'm so sorry that no one told you this earlier but with everything going on anyways the planning committee thought it would be nice if someone gave a speech tonight in honor of your parents anniversary oh that's so sweet do you still think it's sweet if we'd like you to give the speech in a half hour oh um what is a lovely gesture okay i'll go figure out what to say i'm sorry patrick sorry hurts to see the person that you love love someone else no heidi i'm i'm not in love with samantha you're not no no i used to be you know once upon a time but this week was a great example of why we're not right for each other do you think maybe we could be right for each other like you and me i know it's you're right it's crazy hey you wanna dance and 2fd [Music] [Applause] hey maple falls heidi here from archie's diner shout out to my regulars so i'm gonna call up as a special guest to the stage samantha logan where are you [Applause] hi maple falls christmas here has always been really special to me it's a day a week really when the whole town celebrates together it's such a big deal that when i was little i didn't even know that christmas eve was my parents wedding anniversary my parents never made a big fuss over the one day that was their anniversary because they cared more about their marriage every other day of the year so i was lucky enough to grow up watching two people who respected one another grew together and didn't run away when things got difficult they understood that love is not a fairy tale and and they understood that love is not a fairy tale but what if it could be a fairy tale what if we could rewrite it together samantha logan you get off that stage and talk to your prince charming yep you listen to your mother what are you doing here you shouldn't be asking why i'm here you should be asking why i left alex i know our worlds are different but all that means is that our world together will be that much bigger and i want to experience all of it with you but what about your family your royal obligations you're supposed to move back to medal via then i'll go later when you can accompany me someone very wise reminded me that a leader doesn't accept limitations he challenges them and for the first time in my life i truly believe i can be that leader if i have you by my side [Music] i i know it's a lot to ask taking on this life and if you can't i understand i honestly believe i can do anything i'm with you maybe even someday with the queen i always said you were so brave brave beautiful and kind frankly too wonderful to ever let go [Music] i assure you i won't make that mistake again [Applause] oh that'll take some getting used to they just adore you as i do hi again so this feels like an appropriate time to remind everyone that each year we name a king and queen of the mistletoe mambo and not to be too obvious or anything but this year the planning committee unanimously voted that the king and queen of the mistletoe mambo are samantha logan and prince alexander [Applause] [Music] good luck sweetie [Music] do we do now we dance a ceremonial dance with the king queen yep i love you samantha logan i love you too prince alexander [Music] i wish my parents could see how special your family christmas is well [Music] oh what an honor christmas no less i have a christmas message to deliver for your majesties alexander merry christmas my boy how lovely to see
