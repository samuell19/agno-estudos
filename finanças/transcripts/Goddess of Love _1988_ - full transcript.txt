Boyle, God of the Sun, patron of truth, the charges. Aphrodite. With apologizes dear father Zeus, you know I like to be called Venus. Venus. Sometimes known as Aphrodite goddess of love. Daughter of Zeus and Hera. You’re charged as follows. You’re given in wedlock to Hephaestus. ZEUS: The blacksmith God. But you rejected this union, and sought forbidden comfort in others. Hephaestus was not my choice. ZEUS: I will continue. Further Venus, you sought and received the affections of three mortals. All of whom perished. A series of coincidences. Must I be blamed for everything? It is further alleged, that you gave Helen of Sparta to Paris of Troy. But they were in love. MAN 1: It started the Trojan war. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ZEUS: Silence! You have long sat among your peers as goddess of love, but it is quite clear that you have no idea of the meaning of love. The council has spoken, banishment. ALL: Banish, yes, banish. But, father. [THUNDER CLAPS] [BREEZE BLOWING] Will she never return from this exile? Perhaps... Someday... She’ll return when she has won the heart of a man. I know my daughter she’ll do it. And prove that she can keep his love without killing him. Could be a problem. [CAMERAS FLASHING] GUIDE: The Romans called her Venus, the Greeks called her Aphrodite, but everyone called her the Goddess of Love. She was the daughter of Zeus, and the enchanting trouble maker who started the Trojan war. No picture taking, please. The museum prefers you buy their postcards instead. You know, the artist who sculpted this particular Venus is mysteriously unknown. But because of the spectacular craftsmanship and great antiquities, it’s impossible to put a price on her. Suffice it to say she’s undoubtedly the most expensive lady in town. [EVERYONE CHUCKLE] [BELL DINGING] Closing time. The gift shop will be open for another half hour. MAN 2: Excuse me, Miss. How come the Greeks and Romans used the same Gods? GUIDE: Well, let’s remember it was closer to the beginning of time. So, there might not have been enough people for two sets of Gods. Actually there’s a wonderful book in the gift shop... [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Fifteen minutes and 40 seconds to finish step one. Let’s not keep the lady waiting. Ted it’s me Jimmy. How could you possibly say no? Ow! You stabbed me. TED: Well, stop aggravating the person with the scissors. My hand to God, this is the last favor I’ll ever ask you for. No more last favors especially not this one. What’s the big deal? Cathy’s in San Francisco. Jimmy... This is a wedding ring. Saturday, it starts living on Cathy’s finger. I’m officially retired from active duty. That’s Saturday, this is tonight, you still have plenty of time before they put you in moth balls. [HURT] Hey. You know, it took me six months to lay the ground work with Brenda. If I don’t come up with a date for Debbie... Debbie? The actress? Didn’t you fix her up with Chuck recently? They only had a little misunderstanding. Huh, Chuck had to hideout in Santa Barbara for a month. She’s completely different now. She doesn’t carry mace anymore. And she did a commercial, she’s feeling much better about herself. Great, then she won’t mind being alone tonight. Now, look. Ted, I don’t wanna be the kind of guy who waves old obligations at a friend’s face. But? What about Lisa Miller? And what about the Twins? The twins? You have the nerve to mention the twins again? And, Cynthia? The campus sweet-heart? I thought we closed the book on Cynthia. One more page. And we’re even. Let’s go. Okay, okay. Come on, come on. Careful. All right, all right. [UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] This is a mistake. Ted, relax. You’re gonna have a great time. Great cheek Brenda, stop by the table later. Jimmy, I’m getting married Saturday, why did you bring me here? I’m gonna tell you exactly why I brought you here. Because you’re getting married Saturday. I don’t belong within the mile of this place. I’m afraid of Cathy. She’s in San Francisco. How’s she gonna find out? I mean, if a tree falls in a forest, and Cathy doesn’t see it, did it fall? I’m gonna tell her it fell. Honesty has no place in a good relationship. [SNICKERS] The expert. You bet your hight top, look at you, one good relationship. Me? I average 40 maybe 50 a year. Hi, Teddy, when you gonna give me that body perm you promised? Hi, Debbie, just drop by the salon, Alphonso will take care of you. Bag Alphonso! I want you. I don’t do body perms anymore. Man’s got one foot in the grave. Jimmy, I’m not dying, I’m just getting married. You know, those words have been listed as synonyms in the dictionary. Gentleman. Our guest of honor has flown his last mission. [HOOT TOGETHER] Let the bachelor party begin. Couldn’t you've picked a classier place maybe female mud-wrestling? You know we went there when Buddy Miller got married. It’s great stuff to watch but if you dance too close to one of the contestants, you got have your whole suit dry-cleaned. Excuse me guys, I promised Cathy I’d call her at 8:30. [BOOING] Ted doesn’t seem to be having fun yet. Don’t worry, he’s going to. Hi, Thor. How’s the old hammer? [GIGGLES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Charlie. You’ve got Venus in the shop? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Watch the kerb, this thing weighs a ton. No more, monuments. After this we’re going back to jewelery. The next right. [TIERS SCREECHING] [SIREN BLARING] Slow down! Yeah? Tell that to the cops. [SIREN BLARING] WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Harvard, Dr. Cathy Harvard, please pick up the house phone. CATHY: Hello? TED: You’re having fun at the convention? How can you have fun with 400 other psychologist? If you say Good morning, they try to figure out what you really mean. Then you’re having as good a time as I am. What’s wrong I thought you were having dinner with Jimmy? That’s what I thought that too but somehow I managed to walk into my own bachelor party. Leave it to Jimmy! I didn’t even know people did things like that anymore. It’s all been updated, I think the striper’s gonna jump out of a giant quiche. CATHY: I love you, Ted. Thanks, I, needed that. Can I get you anything? Debbie please I’m talking on the phone. I think if we go out there cook a little, we may go back to my place and burn the mood. I can’t. I can't. You can’t what? Ted, is something wrong? All right, you caught me. I picked up your grandmother’s ring from the jewelers. How does it look? Looks great. But I think they took out two inches of gold to bring it down to size six. How big was granny? CATHY: We were always supposed to call her big boned. I can’t wait till Saturday to slip it under your finger. My finger can’t wait either. How about the rest of you? Stop it, Ted. I have a full day of seminars tomorrow, how do you expect me to concentrate? I love you. [KISSES] Me too. See you tomorrow night. [KISSES] Debbie, we have to talk. TED: No, I... BURGLAR 1: A disco? Just put it over there. BURGLAR 2: Easy for you to say. This is no rag doll here. How about giving me a hand? What do you want? Disability? Are you sure this is gonna work? What are you worried about? This is the perfect spot to stash it. All these dummies look alike. Besides, it’s only overnight. Till the heat’s off. Huh. [BREATHING HEAVILY] She’s cold. Big deal, so is my ex-wife. Let’s finish up. You mean, you won’t even frost my tips? Every now and then for old times sake? Debbie. Hey, hey hey. Look who I found. Do you remember Rusty and Dusty? TOGETHER: Hi, Ted. By this time tomorrow night, you’ll be on your way to South America and I’ll finally have a pension plan. I hope she likes papayas. TED: The twins. You’re a madman. JIM: I thought we had a great time with them. TED: Do you remember what it was like spending a night with them in that cave? But why can’t I penetrate your brain? It’s very simple. Boy, girl. Wedding ring. Finger. Married. [THUNDERCLAP] HERA: Here all my husbands, Zeus. It is the moment of destiny for our daughter Venus. So be it. [BUZZING] [THUNDERCLAP] Okay, I hear you, you’re a one woman man. Personally doesn’t work for me but whatever makes you happy. Now if you’d excuse me, I’ve to get back inside and start taking some of the slack. No, wait for me, one last drink with the guys can’t hurt. Good, we’ll talk about sports. Ugh. Slipped on like butter. I don’t believe this. This is crazy. Are you coming or not? I’m gonna get the manager. JIM: I don’t need this. TED: I get the ring, it gets stuck, he’s talking twins. JIM: Thought the twins were cute what do you mean you don’t like their hair? [TINKLING] [THUNDERCLAP] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHING] Could this be Mount Olympus? ZEUS: No, my daughter. Father. ZEUS: You’re in a place called the City of the Angles. Then I’ve crossed over to the other world. ZEUS: Here, Venus, my errant daughter, after 3000 years you may at last have won a heart. [RUMBLING] I’m most grateful my father. But why am I in this place? And not on Mount Olympus? Before you can sit again amongst the Gods, you must prove that fully understand the nature of love. This is your last chance to show that you deserve to be the Goddess of Love. Fail not. Or be imprisoned in stone for all eternity. [RUMBLING] Look it’s just right over here. Common, Ted, I know all my statues I don’t have one like that. And I know what I saw. That’s bizarre. It was right here. So, a statue walked out on you? Maybe you should try a different cologne. I put my ring on the statue’s finger. Look, I’ve got the rites of spring going on inside, if a statue with a ring on it shows up, I’ll call you. I don’t care about the statue. But that ring’s been in my fiancee family for years. Got it. So I’ll throw out the statue and hold the ring. TED: There’s a diamond in the middle and two little diamonds and emerald on either side. The statue had diamond in the middle. No, not the statue, the ring. I don’t care about the statue. Then why did you give it a ring? Did you see this alleged... I was at the front of the building sending two live Goddesses home in a taxi early. POLICE MAN: Okay. I have what I need if we come up with anything, we’ll let you know. Any chance, I’ll have the ring back by say tomorrow? Sure. All we have to do is wait for the statue to make a mistake. Littering, jaywalking, you name it. Then we arrest it and grab your ring. [CLEARS THROAT] Hey Jimmy, wanna stop and get a burger? I don’t want food. What’s one night to a stud like you? Six months of planning for a 47 minute date, the cab driver probably had a better time than I did. What cosmic urge possessed you to tell Rusty and Dusty you’re getting married? I just didn’t feel like taking advantage. [IMITATES TED] I just didn’t feel like taking advantage. Couldn’t you take a little advantage? Like till eleven o’ clock? Look, so you lost one lousy night in heaven. I lost an irreplaceable wedding ring. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [TIERS SCREECH] JIM: Jeez! What was that? Bad driving. Something just floated across the road. It was your guilty conscience trying to change the subject. You really owe me, we could’ve gone to the moon with those babes. Take me home. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] My beloved. Huh? I am Venus, daughter of Zeus. 3000 years I’ve lain entranced in slumber And now the loving touch of a mortal hand has called me from my rest. Your hand has placed this ring upon my finger has it not? My ring! I’ll give Jimmy for this. I don’t know how he whipped up this prank so fast. Just give me the ring and I’ll tell him he did a terrific job. Here’s a little bonus. For a great performance. Thou has princely qualities. You immortals do not deem yourself worthy of a Goddess. Your gesture is kind. But by this symbol, you have given yourself to me. You’re mine and I am yours. What a quaint abode. Where does thou slumber? Look, lady, this is getting a little out of hand. If you don’t give me the ring and clear out I’m gonna have to call the cops. I can see that you do not believe that I’m Venus, Goddess of Love. Don’t feel bad. I don’t buy the tooth fairy either. [THUNDERCLAP] [CHANTING VOICES] You don’t even know Jimmy, do you? Together you and I will dwell for eternity on Mount Olympus. Eternity sounds great, don’t get me wrong, it’s just that it takes up so much of your time. Besides, I have my own plans. You love another? Oh, no, no. If so I shall crush her. Crush her? [BUZZING] Crush her. Oh! Now are you ready for our destiny on Mount Olympus? Mount Olympus? I don’t know about that. You’re a mountain girl, I’m a city boy, I get nose bleeds. You speak words, but they’re confusing. Do you seek to escape me? Of course not, it’s my horoscope. It says I shouldn’t travel for the next six months. You people are into astrology, right? Once more I ask, are you prepared to fulfill the troth you have plighted? [SNIFFS] [SNIFFS] Great perfume. I don’t understand. Perfume, it’s something you put on to smell good. I put nothing on to smell good. You smell this good naturally? All Goddess do. Look... Venus. Any red-blooded American mortal would give his eye-teeth to go back to Greece with you. But I’m not the kind of guy who gets his troth plighted everyday. All I want is a little time to adjust, okay? Very well, you shall have your time. I take leave of you now. Great, I’ll show you out. You’ll need some light. I wouldn’t want you to fall and break anything. [TWINKLING] [SNIFFS] [VENUS CHUCKLES] [STRUGGLING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [BLOWING] [BURST] Don’t worry, it's good for your hands too. Now, I’m gonna be very careful. But I gotta have that ring back. [CLANGING] [TED GROANS] [UPBEAT MUSIC CONTINUES] [MOTOR WHIRRING] [KNOCK AT DOOR] [GROANS] Coming. Who is it? Detective Charles, Police Department. [KNOCKING] Coming. Yes. Detective Charles, Police Department. Yes. Ted Beckman? Right. About your lost ring report. Any leads? Nope. But this statue thing has got us real curious, mind if I come in? Manager of the Pleasure Garden said he never had a statue like the one you described. But yesterday afternoon a statue has disappeared from the museum very valuable. Here’s a picture. Look familiar? Why didn’t you see it on the news last night? I was pretty busy with something when I got home. I can believe it. Haven’t even changed your clothes. I’ve been working on a pet project in the living room. The time just whizzed by. Yeah? It must be some job. All these tools. You know, I... I’m kind of a handyman myself, I would love to have a peek. Uh, it isn’t finished. You know what I mean, being a handyman yourself. So, what about the statue? What about it? Is that the same statue you saw last night at the Pleasure Gardens? I think the one I saw was a little shorter. The light wasn’t too good. VENUS: Beloved. It’s... my assistant. On the project. VENUS: I’m waiting... I always heard that you hair guys did all right. Call me if you get anymore information. I’ll do the same. Oh. And, be careful with your tools. Who was that person? He’s a cop. Cop? A centurion. He wanted to know if I knew where you were. Where were you? Between here and there. Wherever Zeus commands. One minute you’re hard as a rock and the next you’re... Very soft and warm and stolen property. Plus, you’re making me crazy because you won’t give me my ring back. Thus last evening you tried taking it by force thinking I was unaware. You knew? Did I hurt you? Not half the hurt you bring me now by demanding the ring. You gave it to me did you not? That was a mistake it belongs to Cathy? Belongs to a Cathy? You do love another. Then I must crush her. My sister, Cathy’s my sister, it’s her ring. And you can’t go around crushing people, nice girls don’t do that. Look you obviously come from a good family, there must be a 1000 Gods after a girl like you. Alas, no. The good ones are either wed or have other pursuits. Really? I guess somethings never change. You will be my own special God. You know, a girl like you, is stooping way down to marry a guy like me. I mean, who’s gonna come to the wedding of a Goddess and a guy who cuts hair? Have no fear, no one declines an invitation from Zeus whether it be for a wedding or an execution. I can hear Zeus now, "Neptune, like you to meet my son-in-law, the hairstylist." How’s that gonna look at the Mount Olympus Gazette? They’ll be laughing at Zeus. No one laughs at Zeus. Twice. Trust me, if you saw what I do for a living, you would know exactly what a mistake you’re making. Then let me see for myself that I might decide. There’s no way I'm gonna let you near my salon. And that’s that. Okay, but you gotta do exactly what I say. Trust me. What is this? It’s my car. I mean, well, it’s like a chariot. Oh. Where are your horses? Under the hood. They are very tiny but this chariot has more than a 150 of them. Ah. Well, let’s get your seat belt on. Thank you, Mortal. You can call me Ted. [SAXOPHONE MUSIC PLAYING] One towel for the two of them? Sheesh. MANAGER: Look I already went over this with Detective Charles. We, the police, are very through. Isn’t that right, Officer Mikla? Yeah, yeah. Believe me, I have no statue of Venus. I never had a statue of Venus. That guy Ted Beckman is the only one who says he saw it. Didn’t you talk to him yet? Ted Beckman? Oh, yeah, sure. Ted Beckman, he’s our next stop. My cousin Mercury would’ve loved this. He would not have had to be on his winged feet all day. Unleaded? What is this unleaded? It’s like... It’s food for the little horses under the hood. How about some music? Aw, you would sing for me! Not me, my radio. [PEPPY SONG PLAYING] [CLEARS THROAT] Now look, when people start showing up you have to do exactly what I say. Yes, mortal. I mean, Ted. [BUZZING] Nice touch. Locks are such a bother. VENUS: What is this? This place looks like some sort of torture chamber. Depends whose chair you’re in. Come here. There, see. Not exactly a place where a God would hang out. I don’t know a little manure on the floor and Hephaestus would be right at home. TED: Now go over in the corner and act like a statue. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I certainly hope you didn’t pay too much for this. [CHUCKLES] You know those flee markets can be such a rip off. Even the shades don’t help. I think it’s kinda sensitive. [RUMBLING] [SCREAMS] [GLASS CLATTERING] Why don’t you get my afternoon schedule so we can go over it? So you’re not in agree with my taste in art. Is that any reason for you to bring me at stake? Maddy, clean up. [VENUS LAUGHS] Thanks. For um... Getting rid of him. [RUMBLING] Mrs. Wilson you have me at a disadvantage here. My hands are full. Yes, I know they’re full, of all the wrong things. Hold on. But... Ted you didn’t do the back. Of course I didn’t, highlighting the back makes a woman look older, I wanna keep you looking 28. Go knock your socks off. Lisa. Put Mrs. Wilson on a 12 minute timer. You were supposed to stay still and watch me work. You’re promised to me. That woman was caressing you. You wants you to look under her hood. Occupational hazard. You encourage her by working too closely. I can’t work on her from across the room. I can. Please, get back in place. If you wanna see what I do you’ve got to stay still. Ted your twelve o’ clock is here. What will it be? Just a little trim. Around the edges. That’s it? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] For now. TED: Good night. ALPHONSO: Good night, Ted. And don’t forget to lock up. Okay, you can relax now. My brother Apollos spends a great deal of time in the sun. He would appreciate these shades. You want ’em? You got ’em. I’ll ship you a whole box of ’em. Now, if you would just give me my ring back, you could probably still catch the Red Eye to Athens. I mean you’ve seen what I do and it’s obvious I'm not a guy the Gods need hanging around. Not true, Ted, my friend Medusa could really use your help. I don’t do snakes. And I don’t belong with the Gods. Venus, I’m just a mortal. Just a mortal who can harness the wind. It’s only a machine. You’re too modest. You’re truly a God in your right. Zeus would be delighted. And when we go home and when you meet Zeus, take your wind-maker with you. It’ll knock his sandles off. I have no special power. See? The electric company down the street they have the power. Anyone can blow-dry, you wanna try? Be bold, believe in yourself. It is time to yield. Fine, you yield, give me my ring. I cannot. It is the charm that called me from my long sleep. Look I’ve gotta pick up my sister at the airport with or without the ring. I will come. Not a good idea. I need sometime alone with her to explain things. I will explain. Okay, okay, you wait here I just have to go in the back and lock up. Now you’re being more sensible. Anything for a visiting royalty. Yeah! [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [THUD] It’s gone. Sooner or later he’s gonna trip. It’s our statue, we stole it. Common. ANNOUNCER: Flight 29 from San Fransisco now arriving at gate 11. TED: Cathy about the ring, it’s got a small scratch. But the jeweler said if we let him soak it for a few more days it’ll buff out. No. It feel down the sink. And you know plumbers, he won’t be here until Tuesday. Yes. That’s it. The sink. CATHY: Ted, Ted. CATHY: Hi, Honey. Hi. [KISSES] Better to be home. And how! Well? Well, what? Ted, I’m dying to see the ring. I don’t have it. I mean, I don’t have it with me, of course I have it. But I thought it was bad luck for the bride to see the ring before the ceremony. It’s the groom seeing the bride that’s bad luck. But I don’t believe in all that. You know Cathy in no time at all that ring will be living on this finger. CATHY: Aunt Julia’s guest list is as big as the Yellow Pages. I think we’re up to 200. Great. 200 people at my wedding and six of whom I know personally. It’s not that I don't appreciate Aunt Julia, I just wish she’d stop calling me that hair person. It’s just that she'd always wanted me to marry a professional. Her favorite ex-husband was a doctor. Yeah well, a hair person is more than a doctor, he’s a psychiatrist with a comb. I love you, Ted. [THUNDERCLAP] [RUMBLING] [THUNDERCLAP] Ted? What about the rest of me? Just wait till I get you home. I’ve only known you for a year but it’s like we've been together for a lifetime. I feel like we’re brother and sister. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: The white zone is for the loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking. Have you been eating chocolate? Just a little. A little? You know it makes you crazy. Okay, okay, I’d a whole chocolate crumble. ANNOUNCER: The white zone is for the loading... Taxi! Where’s your car? Taxi. You heard ’em. No parking in the white zone. They towed me away. Why can’t I wait for you to get the car? You’re tired. You need rest. You go home. I’ll call you later. Tomorrow we’ll have lunch. I love you. ANNOUNCER: The white zone is for the loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking. VENUE: Sister, my toga. Cathy is your love. I was gonna tell you. So naturally, you left Venus flatly in your Heads Up Salon. You’re mad. You're not gonna start crushing are you? No. No? Why bother? No mortal woman can compete with Venus. You will choose me. Do you mind? This chariot only requires one driver. I am fascinated by the colors that adorn the faces of your women. Perhaps, your magical fingers will touch my face with those colors. Why should I? Because you lied to me and now you must do something nice. Hey! [SKIDDING] Do the Gods have a word for nag? The Gods have a word for everything. And I will teach your tongue to savor. All of them. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? TED: Cathy? Who’s this? What do you mean who’s this? This is Ted. Oh, hi. Why didn’t you pick me up at the airport? CATHY: Instead you sent some raving lunatic I hope I never see him again. I’m sorry Honey, I’ve been getting a lot of pressure lately. Come over and have lunch tomorrow, okay? Okay. But it better be the real Ted. I love you. [WHISPERS] Remember that night in the cab? Cathy what if someone’s listening? Let them get their own girl. [KISSES] How long must I wait in your chariot? That looking glass is a bother. Yeah, all right, we are going to my place. But for once, I’m calling the shots. Shots? Don’t worry. You won’t be sorry. I just want you to put yourself in my hands. Hm, now you speak my language. Common. VENUS: When might I look? TED: Just a second. Almost finished. Just keep your eyes closed. You have a gentle touch. You’re truly an artist. You have the bone structure. [MYSTICAL MUSIC CRESCENDO] [KNOCK AT DOOR] Stay right here, don’t move a muscle. Your mascara will run and you’ll ruin the rug. JIM: Ted it’s your pal. Oh, not Jimmy. Hey, Ted. I just wanted to tell you I feel real bad about last night. I know I pushed it real too hard. I mean for God sakes, you’re an engaged guy. It’s okay, Jimmy, thanks. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Here I am supposedly your best friend pushing you in the arms of twin bimbos, when you obviously wanna save yourself for marriage. I got it. Cathy’s here, couldn’t wait, huh? Hi, Cathy, welcome back. Cathy is not here. You sly devil. You give me all that crud about being loyal to your fiancee. Then on the night she comes back you got this major action right in your own house. It’s not how it looks. I was doing an emergency makeover on this lady. Sure, I get it, emergency. Now, you’re a pair of cosmetic. How about... Introducing me to this magnificent creature? Jimmy Manning, this is Venus. She’s from Greece. I used to go out with a Greek girl. Her name was Irena Papadapolis. Did you know her? I think her family was from Crete. You’re some kinda gorgeous. Is this person your friend? Friend? I’m Ted's brother. Practically. Your family gets bigger and bigger. Jimmy. Jimmy. I have to talk to you. We’ll be right back. Don’t go away doll. You ain’t seen nothing yet. I’ve seen enough to put you in a certain amount of jeopardy. She’s incredible. I've never met a woman like that before. Yeah, you said it pal and you’d be better of if you never saw her again. You’re getting married to Cathy in a couple of days. Jimmy... That poor girl will be all alone. Jimmy. Let me least give her my phone number. Will you listen to me? Did you notice the ring on her finger? I thought I saw that ring before that’s Cathy's. You are out of your mind. First you fake losing your fiancee ring then you give it to this chick. God, talk about living on the edge. I wasn’t faking. Remember last night where I put the ring? Yeah, yeah, on the statue. That’s her. Venus, the Goddess of Love. Somehow that ring made her come to life. Now, she wants to take me back to Mount Olympus, forever. Okay, I get the picture. You don’t wanna talk. Give me a call. I do not like him. He reminds me of my ex-husband Hephaestus. Do you like to put more colors on my face? Look let’s not get off the track here. You seem like a reasonable Goddess. If you’re going to make that tedious request for that ring again I’ll not listen. I must rest now. I’ve had some day. And please do not operate the television so loudly this night. I’m weary of listening to teenage boys, singing about going to drive silly. Wait a minute. There are a couple of things we’ve got to straighten out. [RUMBLING] It’s like talking to a wall. BURGLAR 1: You hit the mailbox. So? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Sleeping in, huh? Probably exhausted from two days of tearing my heart out. Excuse me, Sir, can I ask you a question? I think I’m lost. Yeah, sure. I’m looking for a 142. But I don’t seem to see a 142 on this block. 142 huh? Let’s see the Coopers are 156. [ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYING] Take my money. I’m not a common criminal. Now, my partner and I would like to have a little talk with you. Towards the van, move. Get in. I know you. I never forget a head. You heard the man, move your butt. Take anything you want nobody’s gonna stop you. This ain’t about what you got in your pocket. This is about art. Stolen art. Stuff this in your yap. My yap? Common, shove it in there. Why? ’Cause cries for mercy upset me. [LAUGHING] [TIRES SCREECHES] [RUMBLING] Ted? Where are you? Ted? Ted? Sister, my foot. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Very well. If this is what pleases him. These mortals leave nothing to the imagination. [ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYING] You guys crazy? What do you want from me? Satisfaction. You make me sick. Was it the hair cut? I can fix it. We want our statue back. Your statue? Right. We heisted it legitimately from the museum. Then you ripped us off. I didn’t rip off anything. Oh, yeah sure, it just followed you home. Is that what you want? Venus? Where’d you stash her? We want her right now. Now’s not a good time. She’s in my house. But I’ve very nosy neighbors. Do it tonight, late. When your neighbors’ nose are in their pillows. But if you’re lying... [GUN CLICKS] You’ll be a statue. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [BUZZES] [MUSIC TEMPO INCREASES] [VENUS SINGING] I require unleaded food for my horses. Now? [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES] [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES] [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES] [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES] I can’t confirm you Mrs... He’s not even in yet. I can’t stay much longer, I came in here for an hour and a half. I do his comb out. I’m not his keeper. [SHOUTING] WOMAN: Ted. Expect to come in at three, Mrs. Codger. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Ladies, ladies, ladies. You can all get what coming to you. Please sit down and wait a moment. WOMAN: You know how long I’ve been here? You look like you’ve been involved in some sort of physical activity. I trust it was with Cathy. Is she here yet? You don’t see her, do you? So, it wasn’t with Cathy, Teddy? You’re like you're having a mid life crisis, early. I’m taking her to lunch. You’re going to lunch? Do you realize how much hair you’ve backed up here? [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [CHUCKLES] So, tomorrow’s the big wedding, hm? Interested in a last minute fling with an experienced... Slightly older woman? I’d must do your hair otherwise I’d never forgive myself. We wouldn’t wanna do that, would we? Alphonso, finish up, Mrs. Wilson, will you? Thank you. Am I not welcome here? Sure, you are but let’s talk privately. That sounds promising. Look, I brought you gifts. A power neck tie from a yuppie store. And... And tasty morsels. Look. Something tells me my friends in Rome will adore them. I wonder if they all travel well. Well, my car’s okay. It’s not even paid for yet. How did you get it started? We on Mount Olympus do not depend on the electric company down the street. How else was I supposed to excite those unseen horses? Oh, yes, this is yours. And guess what? The nice woman in the store said that all of your plastic is over the limit. Is that not wonderful? Your hair’s a mess from driving my chariot, let’s get it fixed up like we did with the colors. If it pleases you. What’s this? Emergency washing set. There’s nothing available. I’ll work it out. Not too much water, Mrs. Feeney. It’s time for your set, I've given my personal instructions you’re gonna look great. If you say so, but... We have much nicer cleansing foutains... She needs lots of water, four or five shampoos and at least two cream rinses. I have to leave for an appointment, Alphonso will set you hair. I’ll come back and do the crowing touches. Oh, boy, we don’t want it to rust. CATHY: Hi! Thank God, you’re here. I missed you too, Alphonso. I think he’s losing it. Get him out of here before he turns them into an angry mob. He was a little strange at the airport last night I thought it was the chocolate. Cathy, just in time, I’m starved. The emergency washing set, give her the full Garden of Eden Special. And take care of things till I get back. [CHUCKLES] I’ll read the menu. Common dear. I stopped by Aunt Julia’s house this morning and everything is set up for the wedding. Flowers are being delivered on noon tomorrow and... Ted? Ted? What sweetheart? Have you heard a word I’ve said? Of course. We were discussing Aunt Julia’s flower garden. Pre-wedding jitters? I guess so. Ted, are you okay? I can always call in a favor and get you a session with Dr. Fisher. Please, Cathy, Dr. Fisher is a nut. All Dr. Fisher’s patients think he’s a nut. Is being married to you going to be life on the couch? Only if there’s going to be big log on the fire. Why don’t I come over tonight? We can practice making sparks. I have some people coming by for a business transaction but... It’s a great thought. Well, tomorrow afternoon the ring will be on my finger and it’ll be all over. The ring. Boy is it gonna be all over. VENUS: This substance you’ve applied makes me feel like my face is shrinking. You know what they say? No pain, no gain. Another minute and your pores will be singing Hozana to the skill of Alphonso in Howdy. Can you feel the magic? Oh, my God. You’ve made me look like Hades. Relax sweet thing. You’re going to destroy all of my hard work. Maddie, bring this thing a cafe au lait on the double. Thank you. Aww. Now back to work. Love you, call you later. [CACOPHONY] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] POLICE: Come on, let’s go. ALPHONSO: Teddy, Teddy. Your emergency washing set, did not appreciate the cafe au lait. She was all red out of zillion degrees Fahrenheit. And suddenly she said something about Zeus, and the whole place went up. Christ. That’s an understatement. Was anyone hurt? No, thank God. But there was at least three unexpected flames. And the lady? She just floated out of here. Got into your car. And she shot through the parking lot backwards. Hello, Mr. Beckman. Small world, eh? Not another do-it-yourself project I hope? How bad is it? Well, I’ve never seen anything quite like it. Every single circuit overloaded at the same time. Burned out all your equipment. Which is like lightning strike took place. Beats me. ALPHONSO: That witch come into this shop again, I’m outta here. I don’t care who her father is. I offer him eternity. Is that such a crime? Some guys just don’t know a good thing when they see it. If he does not come to Mount Olympus with me, My father Zeus would say I failed at love again, and he would turn me to stone forever. That’s heavy. My old man knocked us around. But stone? I’ll have another rainy day, Wallie. RADIO: The police are being tight-lipped about the daring museum theft in which someone walked off with the statue of Venus, Goddess of Love. All Detective Edwin Charles would say is that they’re close to a breakthrough [KNOCK AT DOOR] in this million dollar art theft. Meanwhile... JIM: Ted. Hey, in su casa? Thanks for coming by so quickly. De nada , I I knew all along you’d come to your senses. I mean you’re getting married tomorrow. So of course, your gonna hand over any superfluous female action to your oldest and dearest friend. That isn’t why I called, and she isn’t here. Damn and I popped three bucks for the tacos. She might be back. But it’s not guarantee she’ll give me the ring. If she got say kidnapped I still won’t have the ring. You gotta help me out. Easy big fellow. Jimmy, I’m begging you, you don’t know what's been going on. Please. What’s to know? My friend’s in trouble. Stressing dulls you, just tell Jimmy what you want him to do. Here’s a picture of Cathy’s ring. Find a jeweler, any jeweler. Who can make a cheap copy by tomorrow. Just to get me through the ceremony. I worry about getting the real ring after I’m married. JIM: Sounds simple enough. Plain gold band, center diamond, two little diamonds, and an emerald on either side. You’re saving my life. TED: They’re here. JIM: Who’s here? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Jimmy, you’re my buddy right? JIM: What’s going on? [MOTOR SPLUTTERING] [WALKIE TALKIE TALKING] Just promise me, you’ll carry your driver's license from now on. You’re not from LA are you? Hardly. And no more drinkie winkies when you go into driving. A sensible rule. And I shall tell Bacchus. He always pours too freely. You’re so kind and gentle for a gladiator. I adore physically active men. You may go now. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO] What happened? Where’s my car? Wallie is my friend. Wallie? Wallie would not let me drive home. Olympic bar and grill. It seemed an inappropriate spot and it was. Wallie cares about me. You left me in that terrible place of pain and humiliation. See what your Alphonso did to me? It’s not so bad. You’ve turned my life into a shambles. Why can’t I convince you? My charms are more dazzling than any you could imagine. I’m convinced, I think you are a major dish. JIM: Even like this. Wanna taco? You’re hanging by a mere thread. [RUMBLING] I must have your answer soon the Gods grow angry. [THUNDERCLAP] BURGLAR 1: I thought he was supposed to be alone. Who’s that blonde? And why does she have police protection? Just be cool. Maybe she’s a pro. The cops are running a little escort service on the side. I’m telling you, Mac. He set us up again. Now we better get out of here. It would be nuts to call the cops. They’d find the hot statue at his house. We got a million green rectangular reasons to hang tough. Those two choir boys saw a blonde come in, they better see a blonde go out. Otherwise they’re not gonna come in and pick up their trophy. JIM: You weren’t kidding, she is Venus. [WHISTLES] Poor Zeus, Venus was a hell-raiser. You know how kids can be sometimes. For punishment, Zeus gave her in wedlock to his son Hephaestus the blacksmith God. Leave it to Zeus. Despite Zeus, Venus decided to take up a few lovers on the side. A few? She was the Goddess of Love. Zeus got even more angry and inspired her with love for three mortal men. What happened to the three mortals? Anchises was killed by lightning. Adonis was slain by a wild bore and Cinyras perished in combat. She’s a bloody jinx. All set. You know, she doesn’t look so bad in here, maybe you shouldn’t be so quick to get rid of her. Give me your car keys. [EXHALES] See? What did I tell you? Nothing to worry about. He takes her out while we make the grab. Very neat. Let go of it. TED: Just gonna pull around the corner and watch. JIM: Watch what? [ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYING] BURGLAR 1: What is that! [SCREAMS] [THUNDERCLAP] [RUMBLING] [SCREAMING] Have you seen them before? Aren’t they the cable people? DETECTIVE: They’re a couple of local meatballs. You know Mr. Beckman, you’ve had quite a day. Fires, explosions, you’re not into insurance fraud, are you? Don’t you two duffel-bags ever get tired of me? You got us all wrong this time Detective. There’s a reward for a stolen statue. And that guy got it in his house. That’s a ridiculous charge. Right, Mr. Beckman? Ridiculous. Yeah, sure it is. So why don’t we go inside and take a look? Just to show him how twisted he is. How about showing us a warrant? I don’t need a warrant, I’m in hot pursuit. It’s just that it's such a waste of time. You got something in there you don’t want us to see? Common, art lover. Show me what you’ve got. [CLICKING SWITCHES] Must have blown the circuit. Where’s the box? In the garage. I’m telling you, you’re not gonna find anything. DETECTIVE : I could use the exercise. There it is. Bingo. This is... Vera. I’m Vera, Ted's friend. Well now, pretty lady, You... Wanna tell me what went on here? If that is your wish. I was splishing and splashing in the hot tub. Then I heard the voices of two strange mortals inside the house. I became very quite. Suddenly, there were loud noises and screams. Lights flickered and everything went dark. Did you see these two mortals? No. Then I recall that the lightning from the electric company down the street, enters into the house through this small box. But it did not work. So I asked Zeus for his help. Then lightning once again began to flow. Does she always talk like that? She belongs to a little theater group. Detective Charles? We’re all ready to hold ’em down town. The other one spill anything new? I don’t know he's been babbling something about, "It’s alive. It's alive." Well, I want these two tucked in before the end of my shift. Let’s go partner. Oh, Vera? If you remember anything else don’t hesitate to give me a call. Uh-huh. I told you it was waste of time. Good bye, again. Oh, no, not good bye. Let’s just say, see you soon. Vera is waiting. Vera is waiting for what? The proper gratitude. After all I did keep trouble out of your house. You are the trouble. It only seemed so. I can make your life wonderful if you would just... Let go off your earthly ties and come back with me to Mount Olympus. Would immortality be so bad? Oh, yeah, I know your history with husbands. I don’t want to be your next victim. What if you get tired of me in a 100 years and throw me of the mountain? I’ll risk it, I love Greek gods. Right, I just remembered I have an important errand to run. Your friend does not understand. It is your ring that awakened me. It is you I must return with to Mount Olympus. Or. Or what? Or I’m doomed to spend eternity as a statue. That is the decree of the Gods. Never to feel the warmth of love and never to be near you again. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [SAXOPHONE MUSIC PLAYING] [SAXOPHONE CONTINUES PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Cathy, hi. How are you? No, don’t come over. I overslept. Meet me at the shop in an hour. I have not slept like that in ages. The repair crew is already at the salon, I’ve gotta pick up my car and get over there. Where’s that match book? And your answer? Or have I already had it? Tonight, we’ll work it all out tonight. Whatever you do, don’t leave the house. There’s plenty of food in the fridge. I’m not here for your cold roast chicken, I’m here for your love. WORKER: Let me see what I do with the walls. CATHY: After we finish the walls we’ll gather up all this junk and put it out in the alley. Yeah. Ted you sure you’re all right? Oh, sure. You’re worried about this afternoon don’t be. Aunt Julie is making a beautiful wedding her house looks fabulous. Yeah, Aunt Julie, wonderful woman. Look you’ve had an awful time. Go back to Aunt Julia’s and rest. I’ll keep an eye on things here. Then I’ll pick up your tux and we can change. CATHY: Guys, just throw all that stuff out. But save that it’s Alphonso's. I love you for being so mortal. TV: Welcome back to the dating game everybody. It’s time now for Stephanie to share with us her decision. Is it going to be bachelor number one? Bachelor number two or bachelor number three? STEPHANIE: It’s gonna be bachelor number three. Stephanie is sure no wimp. Ted? Oh, Teddy. Are you in there? This is Alphonso. I lost the address to the wedding. And Cathy’s unlisted. So I’d thought I follow... You! You! Desecrater! [SCREAMING] [UPBEAT VIOLET PLAYING] No sign of Jimmy Manning yet? I knew Cathy’s cousin Lester should’ve been the best man. He’ll be here. He’ll be here. Robert, Angela, so good of you to come. Friends of the bride. Hey, Aunt Julia so good to see you. Hold it would you babe? Do you have it? Of course I have it, the jeweler just finished with it half hour ago. You know I showered and got ready and, nine minutes flat. Where’s your out of town visitor this afternoon? Home. She’s under your skin, isn’t she? They both are. Now you owe me for this. I don’t mean money, I mean favors. So what do you think? It’s perfect. PRIEST: And do you Cathy, promise to love Ted? To keep him and hold him for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health so long as you both do live. I do. Do you have the ring? Yes, indeedy. Ted, please place the ring on Cathy’s finger. Now, repeat after me. [RUMBLING] Where you speaking of this ring? [THUNDERCLAP] Central, it’s Detective Charles. I’m gonna need some assistance at 425, Bel Air road. And you better make it quick before the weather changes. Over. Who is this woman? What’s she doing with my ring? Why is this woman still in your life? Ted? Maybe the three of us should go somewhere and talk. [MURMURS] Now I can explain everything. You see... Just tell me what last night meant to you. Last night? I’m sorry. Sorry for what? VENUS: Leave us. You must not interfere with the Goddess of Love. Goddess? This woman is ready for Dr. Fisher. That nut? What else does she know? What about last night? And give me my ring. [RUMBLING CRESCENDO] Don’t get too close to her. By his own acts. Ted has given himself to me. Given himself? Cathy I know this is gonna sound strange... I’m a psychologist, remember? Strange is my life. I accidentally put the ring on the finger of a statue of Venus and, this is what happened. You’re right. That is strange. He speaks the truth, And he is mine forever more. Look. If you give me the ring back and you leave quietly, then I won’t have to call the police. Cathy. Let the two of us work this out. You see, he does not love you. Away, you are history. You do love me don’t you Ted? Be gone. Before I lay you dead at my feet. Ted? I think you better go. I’m not leaving this room. You say you can strike me dead then go ahead and strike. [RUMBLING] If you crush her you might as well crush me too. You would rather die with her than spend eternity with me? I love Cathy. Last night was a mistake. I’m sorry. What happened last night? Enough is enough. I have no need of you. I shall invoke a speedy and terrible destruction. [THUNDERCLAPS] [SIREN WAILING] ZEUS: Before you can again sit amongst the Gods, you must prove that you fully understand the nature of love. [ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYING] I cannot do it. I love you too much. Just as you love each other. You were both willing to die. Rather than live without your true love. Zeus was right. Some Goddess of Love am I. I couldn’t even recognize true love when I saw it. At least love has touched me once. Before the Gods send me to the eternal doom of my stony exile. I release you from your troth. There was no last night. Shocking! They are in the library, I don’t think the woman was lying, you know. [RUMBLING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] DETECTIVE: Open up in there. What happened in here? Just two people in love. Yeah? What about the fireworks? He told you, just two people in love. Does that call for a police raid? By the way, I think I know where you’ll find that missing Venus? I thought you might. Common. So? Where is it? Okay. But handle it with care. She’s one of a kind. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] HERA: My husband Zeus, our daughter Venus fared well. She recognized true love and allowed it to go it’s own way. ZEUS: You make a point. I shall consider giving her a second opportunity. Perhaps when the warm season ends. Venus always did love that type of animal. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] [SAXOPHONE MUSIC PLAYING]
