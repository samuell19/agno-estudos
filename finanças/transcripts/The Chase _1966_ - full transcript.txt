Hey... No, man. Oh... two years since I had my hand on a car. Let's go. Plenty of gas. You take his coat. Give me the shirt. We'll fight about the pants in Mexico. I'll tie him and gag him here. Good Lord. Hey, what'd you do it for? Hey, you bastard. Hey, come back here! Hey, come on. Come on back here, you butcher! Butcher! - Turn your head back. - He's got on a prison suit! - Turn your head back. Keep it there. - Grandma, he's got on a prison suit! - We gotta tell somebody! - We ain't gotta do nothing, except let white men take care of white men's troubles. Sit you still, boy. - Hey, Lem. - J.L. I come to report a tire and jack stolen from my car. Excuse me. Hello. Yeah, just a minute. It's long-distance. Tell them I'm sleeping. Or was. He's sleeping, or was. Who is it? It's Hearst at the state farm. He says he don't care who you're sleeping with. All right, I'll take care of y'all now. Where was your car when they were taken? Front of my house. Calder. He busted out? When did... When did he bust out? Is he talking loud enough for y'all? No, I haven't heard nothing. Well, Bubber isn't gonna be that big a fool to come up around here now. I'll let you know if we find anything out about that tire. All right. Well, I'll go round and see Reeves, but I don't believe he's gonna know anything about Bubber. All right, I'll call you back. Hey, Leroy! Yeah? Bubber Reeves escaped from the pen. Is that so? Hey, Jim, Bubber Reeves just broke out of the pen! Bubber Reeves escaped! Is there any other news I can give you gentlemen? - Yeah. Did you hear how he got out? - Nope. I bet he's gonna give you some trouble before you get him back. I'm awful glad you're worrying about it, Lem. Sure, I'm worried. He stole one of my diamond watches from my store. How many cars did he steal and wreck? Leroy, Sheriff Calder don't remember anything about that. He just remembers Val Rogers. Bubber Reeves smashed up his special Cadillac, and uh... he marched him straight off to jail. That's cute, but the way I heard it, Bubber got sent up for driving an airplane drunk. - I like your version a lot better... - Whose airplane? - Val Rogers' airplane. - We gotta keep it in the family, Leroy. You know, Jake Rogers and Bubber Reeves, they trade things back and forth, like... wives and... airplanes. Hold on, Lem. Listen... - What are you saying, Lem? - Well, it was Val Rogers' airplane. That's right. I'll tell you what, you buy yourself an airplane and get somebody to borrow it, and then I'll come and arrest them. - Calder? - Yeah. I hope there ain't gonna be no trouble here tonight. Them dental boys may not like it. I know what those boys are gonna like tonight, and so do you. You going out to see Mr. and Mrs. Reeves? That's nice. Mighty nice. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Sam. Uh-oh... - That ain't a good sign. - Oh, what ain't a good sign? You call me "mister" when I ain't got the mortgage interest payments. No, that ain't true, Mr. Sam. You see, I... I'm respectful toward colored people, unlike a lot of other people in this town. Mr. Sam, why don't you sell that little picayune farm of yours? It's awful hard for a man to make a living these days on just a one-man farm. Tell you what, I will cancel your interest payments, I'll cancel your mortgage, and I'll give you $500. A man born to love a farm, he ain't got no place to go when it's gone. That's what's the matter with the sheriff. I'll stick with it, Mr. Briggs, and hope to bring you the payment on my next crop. In that case, Sam, I... In that case, you'll have to raise the interest. You don't like to do it... No, I... I don't mind. You see, I may be many other things, Sam, but I ain't no liar. I... I'd like to raise the interest. No, sir, you may be many other things, but you ain't no liar. Well, I can't say that I like the science much, Mr. Rogers. That's no way to talk. Defeatist talk never brings up oil. You better tell your father that I done checked all the soil tests, and I'm worried. When my father smells oil, nature repents, and there'll be oil, and when it flows... and flow it will... my father will be right here with a bonus for everybody. It'll be Saturday night in a few hours, and I've one more duty... to see our Mexican workers and wish them a safe journey home. You all have a happy weekend and wish me one. We've labored hard, and we deserve the happiness that all Americans know to be their birthright. It's Mr. Rogers. Good to see you, Mr. Rogers. They say to thank your father for the television and all he has given. No, he didn't. He said my father, the unclean son of a pig, could keep his television and pay him more money. The cotton's all chopped... Vaya con Dios. See you back again at the rice crop. They are ungrateful and ignorant, Mr. Rogers. Are you grateful? Are you grateful, Mrs. Ella? - Sí. - We are grateful. A full year's job, two healthy children and a good wife. You have a very pretty wife, Mr. Rogers. My, I cut out her picture every time I see it in the newspapers, and I bet soon you will have a fine son. Oh, I don't think so. You must not be discouraged. I'm not. I guess you won't be helping out around here tonight, huh? You ask me that every Saturday night, and every Saturday night, I say no. What if I should drop dead? Want me to leave a note with the name of the motel where they can find you almost every weekend? Don't bother. I'll be back in time for the funeral celebration. Look, I'm your father. I got a right to know. You're not my father. I married your mother. That didn't make you my father. Well, she said sometimes maybe I was. You're lying. She told me who he was, and he's dead. Look, I don't want you around here no more. As soon as Bubber gets out of the pen, I'm gonna ask him to take you away. You pay me my mother's part of this business, and I will be out of here in one hour. Man, I wish I could. I sit here thinking, and sometimes I think I know where I can find that money. You just try it. You just try it, and you're not gonna live an hour past it. You've got my word. - Howdy, Mrs. Reeves. - What is it? I was wondering if I could come on in and talk to you and Mr. Reeves. Mr. Reeves, the sheriff's here. Well, what is it? I got a call a while ago from the state farm, and Hearst says that Bubber's busted out. - Where is he? - Well, we don't know. What'll they do to him? Howdy, Mr. Reeves. Most likely, they'll catch him and send him back and add to his sentence. That's too bad. Bubber just had a few months to go, and I figured that Bubber isn't gonna... He's got enough sense not to come back home here, but if he calls, you oughta try and talk him into going back, because it'll be a whole lot easier on him. He escaped with a real hard-knocked fella. I'm sorry about it, Mrs. Reeves. I don't believe you're sorry. Mr. Reeves. He won't come home. No. Do you think Anna will hear from Bubber? I don't want to hear her name. I told you that. I've been thinking and thinking... What did I do wrong? Other people had bad boys... Leroy, Jake Rogers. Jake Rogers... They all grew out of their boy meanness. What did I do wrong? - What are we gonna do tonight? - Well, nothing would be nice. It's Saturday night. Why don't you ask Val Rogers to ask us to his party? - When he wants us, he'll ask us. - He'll never ask us. Never ask his own vice president. I think it's a disgrace. Always asks the sheriff and Ruby. Now, Emily, it's not our business. - Where's Damon? - Honey, go shopping or something. Mr. Rogers doesn't much like visitors around. You got it ready? Hello, Damon. - I said, hello, Damon. - Hello, Emily. And now, a happy birthday to a great gentleman, Mr. Val. - Thank you. - Happy birthday, Mr. Rogers. Thank you all very much. I'm really... Thank you. Well, good day. Have a pleasant weekend. - Ask him. Go on. - Mr. Rogers, before you go... Edwin would like to invite you to have a birthday drink with us this evening. - Just a few of us. - Thank you, I'm having guests. Yes, we all heard that. Just thought you'd like to see how the lower classes live. Are you the lower classes? Good-bye. My wife's joking, sir. Don't apologize for me. I don't like it, Junior. - We all miss you, Damon. - Yeah? Why the hell haven't you answered my calls? Because I didn't hell feel like it. It's not as easy as it was, and my wife isn't as stupid as... Yes, she is. Damon, I want to see you tonight. Now, don't use that tone to me. Try it on the other vice president. He likes it. He married you for it. How is she in bed? I don't carry a computer to bed. What are you talking about? Talking about that girl I saw you with. - You're lying. - You want me to prove it to you? - Or the very moral Val Rogers? - Good-bye, Emily. - I'll see you. - Tonight? Yes. Hey, Bubber Reeves escaped today. - Did he? When? - I don't know. I just heard about it. Well, that'll give them something to talk about for a few hours. Lock their doors tonight. Pretending Bubber's something to be frightened of. Maybe you should be frightened. Emily, I told you about that in secret. - You told me about that in bed. - Yes. Well, I guess I'd better tell you. Remember, just before Bubber got sent up last time? Well, Damon and I, and some other people, of course, were all sitting around Sol's Café, beering it up. Well, Bubber was there, right? Well, I told it to him... for a joke. You didn't. I don't believe it. I thought it'd be nice to prove to him that you were sorry after all these years. Oh, look at you, upset about anything and everything. Everybody laughed. Did Bubber laugh? No, he didn't. He just stared. You know how he does. That funny stare... like everything has gone all wrong, and he just can't figure out why. Welcome to Terrell. It's dull, but it's nice. Why, child, you can always come back to Houston with me. Watch it, young lady. They're wolves and old enough to be your granddad. My, look how they wear their shirts down here. What are you doing? Pray for us, Ms. Henderson. I'm praying for you, honey. I'm praying for us all. I'm praying for you too, honey. Well, much obliged, ma'am, and bless your old heart. That's very nice of you, Mrs. Henderson. We sure appreciate it, but why don't you go on home and do your praying? - All right, honey. - Now, thank you very much. Bless the strangers within our gates... Anna? Sol, tell Anna I wanna see her, will you? Tell her yourself, if you can find her before Monday. Hi there. Well... you don't see horns much anymore. How come you got horns, boy? Who ain't, like the man said. Going home? Mexico? Mexico? Mexico? Where are you going? Give up, boys. I'm a good shot. I'll follow you down... all roasted. I'm hungry. You've been sitting there for the last hour, staring at nothing. - Is there something the matter, Edwin? - No. Something the matter with me. It's funny to have indigestion before supper. Sweetheart, would you fix this corset? Where's my cuff link, now? Mm, that's a beauty. - I like it dyed like that. - It's not dyed. It's new. It cost a dollar to shorten and maybe a thousand to buy. Val sent it. - Val sent you that dress? - For his birthday party. That was nice of him. Turn around, honey. - Val sent you that? - Mm-hmm. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I just wish I had $1000 to buy you a dress like that. Where's Calder? I wanna see him. Well, I wanna see him. - Somebody here to see you. - Hello, Edwin. - Evening, Ruby. - Hi, Ed. - You going out to Rogers' for dinner? - Yes. We're not invited. Never are. I wonder why. Or you mean you wonder why he invites poor people like us. Well, maybe that's because we're so beautiful, so charming, so witty... What do you want, Ed? Is there any news about Bubber? Nope. Do you think he's heading for here? What's the matter with you all? Can't you think of some way to get yourself excited on a Saturday night besides all that? Well, my wife's frightened. She wants a deputy sent to our house. What the hell's the matter with you, Edwin? Well, when I was 16 years, Bubber was too, you know. Yeah... And that was the year Bubber was sent to reform school... the first time, I mean. Listen, Ed, we're running real late tonight, now. Look, I'm coming to it. We both worked in a grocery store and $50 was missing... and old Sunshine was sheriff then, and he blamed it on Bubber. So to keep him out of reform school, his mother marched him in there on a Saturday with a store full of customers, and made him give that money back and say out loud he was sorry he stole. A bunch of boys began to yell things to tease him. You hate to be different, so I began teasing him too. He grabbed the butcher knife... Oh, come on, Edwin... Please listen to me. He never stole that $50. I did. Well... that's nice going. I was scared to say so then... but a few years later, I went to the sheriff, old Sunshine, and he told me not to worry. Yeah. If it makes you feel any better to come over here and tell me all this, and you did it, and I don't particularly like it. Now it's time to go home. - We'll see you some other time. - I don't like it either. Well, a lot of years go by... All right, here it is. Night before Bubber goes to jail this last time... somebody tells him the story, and he acted mighty mean when he heard it. My wife was there and saw him. She's frightened he's coming for revenge. Tell your wife to forget about it. This is the last place in the world Bubber's gonna come to. If Val Rogers asked for a deputy, you'd send one fast enough. What do you mean by that? You mean there's something I'd do for Val Rogers that I wouldn't do for you? - Well... - Huh? Good night. Good night, Ruby. - Wait a minute. Come on back here, Edwin. - Don't. Don't. We're late. So what? You scared of being late to Val Rogers' party? No. Well, take off that dress, Ruby, and put on the old one. The one that I paid for. All right. Wrap that one up. Give it back to him. You didn't have to tell me that. Look at that helicopter up there with a sign on it! Happy Birthday, Mr. Rogers! Happy birthday! Oh, look, that's ours! That's ours. That belongs to me, madam. What's the matter with you? Are you crazy or something? It's ours. Mrs. Sifftifieus, I'm telling you, that's mine. Honey, isn't that our sign up there in the sky flying around? Isn't it ours, honey? No, Mrs. Sifftifieus, that's a helicopter. - Your husband bought a jet. - That's a helicopter? Oh, well, everybody just likes to argue about everything all the time. So I was wrong. Come on, let's do the Jerk. Anything wrong? Oh, no, no, everything's all right, Father. Everything always is. Oh, Crane, I was sorry to hear about your operation. I haven't had an operation. At your age, it must've been very painful, but money buys everything. They put on quite a show, don't they? I had to invite them here to help raise money for the college. You didn't like the dress I sent you? Yeah, she liked it, but I didn't like it, because I didn't buy it for her. - Oh, I'm sorry. - My husband's a proud man. Sometimes silly proud, but I can't do anything about it. Well, he ought to be generous and let me do him a favor. You already done me a favor, Val. You appointed me sheriff. That was very little. I know you want to go back to farming. I want you to pick out some land around here. I don't want you to give me anything, Val. I think I'll have enough money pretty soon to buy my dad's farm back. - There's oil wells out there. - I don't think they hurt the land any. Well, if that's what you want, take it. - I'll give it to you. - I don't want you to give me anything. I'll stay on as sheriff long enough so I'll have money to pay for it. You'll get along all right wherever you are. You like the woman you live with. I wanted that for my son, but... Please, I've got to get out of here. Now, our marriage contract includes getting through a birthday party for my father, and we will. What game do they play for my benefit? Why? We'll talk about the land tomorrow. You're a little edgy tonight. Well... - You having a good time? - But of course. Thank you. Let me see you dance together. I love to see you dance. I can't stand these people. I can't stand them either, but we'll have to put up with them until the party's over. Heaven knows how long it'll last. Planning to meet your friend? Yeah. She'll wait for you no matter how late it is? Yeah, she'll wait for me. We've been waiting for each other all our lives. What about your friends? Well, I'm driving to Houston. We'll have breakfast in the morning. Where you going? You're going home. You're going home. You just keep telling yourself there's no other place to go. Your deputy's outside. He says it's urgent. - Slim? - Yes, sir. Thank you. Be back in a minute. I don't want you drinking a whole lot tonight, Jake. I said I don't want you to drink! I want you to stop giving me orders, Father. You're right, Jake. You're right to want it. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. It is my pleasure to acknowledge a gift to Rogers College from Mr. Theodore Crane for $500,000... to endow a dormitory for women. A dormitory for women? Why, you old goat. Are you up to it? Thank you. Thank you. Born here... Born here, I was not, but to Texas, I come. Americans must... Mr. Sifftifieus... Mr. Sifftifieus says that we Americans must lead the world's ignorant masses. Only from the world of books can man become free, and so Mr. Sifftifieus pledges one million. Dollars. Now, our host, Mr. Val Rogers. It's a model of the college. It's for you, Dad. Happy birthday. Thank you. We are building here, in this county, one of the finest colleges that money can buy, so that our young men and women will never have to leave here, as my son did, to be educated, and it is my desire that before my next birthday... Jake, Bubber Reeves escaped from prison this afternoon. ...to turn my responsibilities over to my son, Jake. He's been seen over to the Mexican section. He and his wife, and hopefully their children, will continue to build all that was begun here years ago... and that when he has his 60th birthday, he can say, as genuinely as I can, it has been a wonderful, rich and fulfilling life. Jake... tell Anna I wanna see her. - Now, leave Anna alone. - Listen, I can't leave her alone... She's got nothing to tell you. Leave her alone, I said! Move! Jake! Jake! They're waiting for you to make a speech. - Sorry, Dad. I can't stay... - What's happened? - There's no time... - You can't leave the guests. - It isn't the time now! - Why? I've got to go! - Stop running away from me. - Father, we can't resolve something now! We can't go on disappointing... Jake, stop running away from me! What's happened? I've known for a long time, and I've said nothing... hoping it would change. I love Jake. Maybe, as an only child and only son, I loved too much. Where's he going? Val, I can't tell you what Jake doesn't wanna tell you. You must tell me. I demand to know! Come on, Val. You owe it to me, Calder. You owe it to me! You'd better think about that, Val... You'd better think about that a whole lot. That's about it, isn't it, Val? Somehow, it always winds up with what's owed you. I wonder what's gonna happen... when he finds out just what is going on. Oh, it's so quiet out here... after all those people and all that noise. What were we doing there? What in the hell were we doing there? We'll make it. Yes, sir. Evening. Sitting out in the dark, eh? Well, maybe that's the best way. Oh, we... we heard about Bubber. You know, there never was any real meanness in that boy. No, he was just wild, that's all. I hope he don't find out about how his wife's been carrying on. That'll make him sure enough wild. We never had any children. It's hard when you don't. It's hard when you do, I guess, as you folks sure know. - My... - They're bound to catch him. Sure they always do. What is that I smell so sweet? Jasmine and honeysuckle. You folks sure have done wonders with this garden. I like this house. I always have. If ever you make up your mind to sell it, just think of me, hmm? Phone's ringing. Answer the damn phone. Yeah? Barrett? Calder. Not yet. They claim they saw him up to the Mexican section, but nothing turned out. Where? McCormack? Never heard of him. What's that got to do with Bubber? Are you sure? Well, I'll try to find out then. Well, just keep your shirt on till I do. Okay. Well... a guy got killed up in Siddonsville... and Bubber's fingerprints is all over him. Hmm. I don't... I don't believe Bubber... Listen, run in there and get my stuff, honey, will you? And here are the results of yesterday's Major League games. Hi, honey. Get up and get some drinks for people. You haven't moved from that radio all evening. What the hell's the matter with you? Who wants a drink? Who wants to dance with me? Oh, come on, honey, let's dance. I need a partner. Sweetheart, let's dance. How about you, honey? Nobody dance, I'll dance by myself. Mary. Mary... Honey, you're drunk. And nobody's gonna dance with you when you're all tanked up, so why don't we just go upstairs and lie down and sleep it off. You'd like that, wouldn't you? No, sir, loving husband, I don't close my eyes. This portion of the news, "Spotlight on Texas, " is brought to you by... What the devil are you doing in here all evening, hmm? At Confederate Soldier, everybody knows you can... Oh, my God. You're trying to find out if your old pal Bubber Reeves is back. Oh, honey, I told you to stop worrying about that. Be quiet, Emily. We'll protect him, won't we, Damon? Well, we sure will. Now, listen, if he comes around here and tries to bother you, I'll just pull out my pistol and go, "Bang, bang!" Bang, bang! Bang, bang, bang! Not 2000, but for only $662. Oh... old Edwin. Old Edwin's a fox. He's not studying about Bubber Reeves. He's sitting there watching them little girls dancing with them little boys. God knows what goes on over there. Stop looking at them little girls. You like them younger and younger, don't you, honey? I sure do. Come on. Don't you, son? Don't you like them younger and younger? I wasn't thinking about things like that, Damon. I was thinking about myself at that age. All the things I wanted and believed would happen. Ooh. Here we go... My husband, the Saturday-night philosopher! Hi, Archie! Welcome to the party. Hi, Archie. Give me a kiss. Old Archie's come to help protect Edwin from Bubber. I don't need anybody to protect me, Emily. I've told you a dozen times. Yes, you do. ♪ Who's afraid of Bubber Reeves, Bubber Reeves, Bubber Reeves? ♪ My Edwin! Oh, baby, I wouldn't hurt you. You know that. - Bang, bang! - Bang, bang! Bang. Bang. Yahoo! Put that away, you crazy fool! You wanna kill somebody? Get him out of here! I don't want him in my house! You get him out, if you're man enough. Oh, take it easy, little buddy. If Bubber Reeves comes around here, just take out your pistol and shoot it. No, he can't do that. He don't have no pistol. Hey, you don't have no pistol, boy? Here, take mine. I don't want your pistol, Damon. - Hey, we heard a shot! - What happened? We heard a pistol shot. What's going on? We were playing a game. Pretending we had our guns out looking for Bubber Reeves. Lem got carried away. Why don't you get carried away? I'll pretend I'm Bubber Reeves, and you come looking for me. Why don't you go hide, and maybe I will. I'm Bubber Reeves. Get me! Wow! Look at that. Look at that! Mm, I think I'm gonna go hide myself too, so she can come find me. I think you oughta stay here with me. What you doing, Edwin? Nothing. Thinking. Let's us dance. Let's show Damon and Emily. I don't dance, Mary. You know that. Look at that. Well, Emily likes to dance, and Damon likes to dance. Uh-huh. They call it that. Listen, Edwin, I got something to tell you. My husband and your wife are having an... I don't like men who slap women. You don't like men who do anything to women. Yeah... You know, a lot of those kids are really rich. New money, of course. That old saying, "New money dances itself away while old money waits for them to weary." Is that so? I never heard that saying before. It's nice. The rich ain't serious anymore. Don't have to be. Not like us. People say you're rich, Billy. People's the biggest liars on Earth. Oh, my God! Caught you in the act. Having a party? Yes, sir. I caught him out here smooching. What do you think of that? Well, folks don't seem to think much of married couples changing partners these days. Of course, Mrs. Briggs and I are... old-fashioned. Uh, Edwin... I've often wondered if Val Rogers knows about his son and Anna. Do you think he does? Well, how should I know, Mr. Briggs? Mr. Rogers doesn't confide in me. Well, somebody ought to tell him. If only for the boy's sake. Bubber Reeves running around loose, God knows where. Why don't you tell him? I think he might appreciate it. Edwin... Brewster's sister told me he's in the house. Would you ask him to come on out? I wanna talk to him. Brewster! - Calder wants to see you. - Hope I'm not busting up your party. Anytime, Calder. Lem, could a traveling jewelry salesman by the name of McCormack been on his way here to see you? Never heard of him. Why? Well, he's dead. - Dead? - Yeah. Do you think he was killed? Yeah. Come on. Let's have a party! Have a drink with us, Calder? - I don't believe I will right now... - He don't drink with poor folks, honey. I sure do wish that I knew your secret charms for Val Rogers. I bet you do. Tell you what. Stop around one day. I'll give you a lesson. Do you think Bubber Reeves had anything to do with killing this McCormack? Nope. Don't worry, Edwin, we'll protect you. Hey, Calder, why don't you stick around and help us protect him? All you need to come to my party is a pistol, and you got one. Well, with all the pistols you got there, Emily, I don't believe there'd be room for mine. Don't you understand? He's got to go put a guard around that motel to be sure Mr. Jake and Miss Anna aren't interrupted. How much did Mr. Val pay you for that, boy? You know, every year on my birthday, I think, "Calder, give yourself a present and take a sock at Damon Fuller," and this year, about eight days from now, I think I'm gonna treat myself. Hey, Calder! If he comes back and you need deputies, every man here would be glad to help! We don't need your help, Lem. The state of Texas says anybody can own a gun. Most of you got two, but deputies you ain't... so you just stay drunk and forget about it. You see, I... I don't drink, myself. Except possibly the occasional bottle of beer. That's good. And I respect the law. Well, that makes two of us in town. - He's not always a sweet-tempered man. - No, he isn't. Hi. Anna? Anna? Anna! Anna! What's the matter? Oh, I fell asleep. You're early. Hey, you're shaking. No, look what I have. - For a whole year? - No, for tonight. You've got the jitters. - Was it bad at home? - No, no worse. Like always. I can't take much more of it. - Now, how many times did I say that? - Every Saturday night. You're the only woman I ever knew who never has to talk. First thing I ever noticed about you. Even when you were a little girl. I got a present for you. Well, open it, darling. How much did they cost? Hmm? $500? 800, 900? Why do you have to know? 2,000. Jake, where am I gonna wear them? You keep giving me things like that. They're gonna sit in my lousy room in a rotten drawer, and I'll stare at them. I didn't marry first, Anna, you did. I didn't marry first, you did! Oh, Jake, I heard you. Come on. Stop talking foolish. Stop talking anything. Next year, this time... maybe even tomorrow... you'll be far away. Why do you talk like that? I don't ask you for it. No, you don't ask me for anything. Why don't you? Because I wouldn't get it. Don't be sure that if you'd ever said, "Leave... leave, leave now." I said it once, years ago. I was very young. I thought it wouldn't hurt us to wait. Jake, you talk too much. Tell me that you love me. I love you. I've always loved you. You've always known. Tell me that you love nobody else. I love nobody else as I love you. He escaped this afternoon. Where is he? Calder said... he's headed home. Oh, poor Bubber. - Where you going? - I'm gonna find him. - Tomorrow. - No. You won't find him at night. You don't know where to start. Tomorrow! If he's come this way, it's because he needs help, and he needs it... now. He's gonna need money. I like Bubber, Jake. I love Bubber, Jake. So do I. I love you as I've never loved anybody else. I waited all those years and all these years. Bubber had a bad time, Jake, and so did I... and there isn't any time to say all the things that don't need saying. Give me the keys, Jake. Go away, Jake. It's Bubber's trouble. Leave me alone. I'm coming with you. Lester? Lester! Lester... It's me, Bubber. What you doing here? - Lester, I'm in trouble. - When you ain't been? - You got a car? - Ain't nothing here that runs. You got any money? - Lester, I'm in trouble. - Yeah, yeah... - So you got to get away from here fast. - That's right. Look, Lester, this time it's big. If I'm running in the luck I'm used to, I'm gonna get blamed for a murder. You gotta help me. But I can't. I ain't got nothing. Bubber... go away, please. No. Now, Lester, you owe me a favor. I took a rap for you once, Lester. You swore you'd pay me back someday. Yeah. I remember, but this four bits I got here in my pocket won't take you far. Does my wife... still live above the place? Last I heard. All right. Now, you go find her. Bring her back here and have her bring me some money and clothes. You can trust her? You know any reason why I can't? No, I... I... I guess not. Now, you stay here, and if somebody come by, they'll think it's me. Okay. I'll be at the wharf. Now, just go. Go fast. - All right. - Go on. When my office was informed by the warden of the state farm of the escape of Simmons and Reeves, we went into immediate action. We set up roadblocks surrounding the entire area. We got dogs tracking that bottomland down there. That's how we discovered McCormack's body about an hour ago. There's no doubt about it that they killed him. Their fingerprints have been identified. That is the kind of officer we need in this county. That McCormack was a fine man! You said you never saw him, didn't even know him. Prince of a fella. Lem, you just said you never saw him before. I remember him now I see him on TV. Oh, hell, I don't believe you. I don't! You're a clown. All of you are clowns! Clowns! God, I'm sick of sitting around looking at dead men on a Saturday night. Damn fine way to spend a Saturday night. Honey, let's go to the club and dance. Dancing? Is that what they call it now? Archie... That McCormack... he had a wife... and three little babies. Help! Help! Help! - What's the matter? - I didn't do anything to her. I saw Bubber. He's over there. There's Bubber. He's over there. Hey, whoever you are, stop where you stand. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Just go on home. You were going after me with a gun, mister. Well, somebody thought you were somebody else, that's all. That's enough to go running after me with a gun? Listen... boy, now get. You were snooping around white kids' parties. - That's not true. I was taking a walk. - Why don't you walk where you belong? You got a private street, with a white sidewalk? Well... what the hell's going on, Arch? I was taking a walk, Mr. Calder. Oh, Lem, put the damn gun away. Come on. Go on home, now. Roy, go on home. Come on. Good to see you patrolling. I'm not patrolling. I'm just looking for an ice-cream cone. Taxes of this town pay your salary, Calder, to protect the place. Well, if anything happens to you, Lem, we'll give you a refund. Come on, Damon! Come on, my dancing darling. Let's get out of here. You go ahead, honey. We'll be there in 10 minutes. Paddy! We're going down to Sol's. We'll be there in about 20 minutes, okay? Damon, take me with you. Can I go with y'all? No, Mary, no drunken driving. Don't leave me here alone. Please take me. Come on. Get in. Come on. Let's go. I felt sure he'd be here. I thought I'd walk in here and find him like I used to when we were kids. Where will we look now? He's not going to come to my place. If he tries to get to me, he'll see all the people and be frightened away. Have you ever written to him about us? To make it worse for him in prison? I'm afraid I'm going to lose you. I don't want to lose you, I want to marry you. I waited all these bad years to hear you say that. It's just like you to say it at the wrong time. Just like you. Now, look, you. I want to find Bubber tonight, and that is all I want. It's Bubber who is in trouble, Jake, not you. You and I can wait, as you made us wait so many years. Things come so late... I guess, for most people. They found a traveling salesman dead. They say that Bubber and the man he escaped with murdered... My boy never murdered nobody. Don't you come around here saying that. But I didn't come to upset you. I come to pray for you and to pray for Bubber. We don't need your prayers. ♪ Blessed assurance Jesus is mine... ♪ My boy hasn't killed anybody! ♪ Blessed assurance Jesus is mine... ♪ $285.43. Briggs says he wants to buy the house. I'll find him. I'll tell Calder we'll have 5,000 by Monday morning. We're not gonna sell the house. I'm not gonna... This... is all I have. I've saved for it all these years. I'm not gonna sell the house. He's our son. No matter what happens... he's our son. Now, what's our hardworking sheriff doing in here? Well, I think he's still looking for my daughter, but he ain't going to find her until Monday morning, just like always. Don't wanna wait that long, do you? She'll be here before Monday, and you tell her I'm looking for her. Anna... Anna! Anna! Anna? Anna, the sheriff wants to see you. Guess why. - Well, what the... Who's up there? - What's going on? Well, come on down here, boy. All right, Mr. Sol. What in the hell's going on? What are you doing up there? I was walking by, and I just thought maybe Anna was... Anna! He says, "Anna." Maybe he's got the right to leave out the "Miss" before a white girl's name. Mr. Sol, don't you remember me? I'm Lester Johnson. I just come along to... Just come along to visit in a white girl's room, and go in that room and make yourself at home? You mix yourself a drink? No, no. I didn't come to visit nobody. You expect white men to stand by while you carry on like that? Oh, cut the talk. Now, come on down, boy. Put your knife away. Knife? I got no knife. Oh, yes, you have. Put it away and put your hands up. Hey! Hold it! Who's doing all that damn firing? Is that you, Damon? Hell, yes, I'm firing. We caught him in Anna's room. Sheriff, I ain't done nothing. I... I was going to leave a messa... I was just stopping by to say hello. He was just stopping by to say hello to a white woman. Hello, Pappy. Hello, Grandpappy. You turning over in your nice graves? Where you from, boy, up north? I was born right here, and y'all know that. Come on, Lester. Come on. Put your damn gun up. Lester, didn't you have a little trouble a long time ago with Bubber Reeves? Bubber Reeves? Are you tied up with Bubber Reeves? Come on, now, Damon. Get in the car, Lester. - Hey, hey, officer, no physical... - Get in the car. You boys go on home, now. You really love his kind, don't you? Come on, Calder. Now, let us talk to him a little while. I'll bet we could get some news about Bubber out of him. Why don't you go on home and open another bottle and get back in bed with your friend's wife? You go on back to Val Rogers' dinner party, and you tuck him in bed and kiss his hand or something! Well, you're a real lucky fellow, Johnson. Real fortunate fellow. Where's Bubber? I don't know. Where's Bubber, Johnson? I don't know. What were you gonna... what message were you gonna leave Anna? There was no message. It was nothing. I just come on by to say hello. Now, if you'll just stop here, please, I'll get out and go on home. Well, I'm going to have to lock you up anyway. For what? I've done nothing, Sheriff. You've got no right to do that. - You can't lock a man up for... - For not telling me what I wanna know. That's right, but I'll get you a lawyer on Monday, and he can tell me all about that. I'm sorry to have to do it, Johnson, but it's for your own protection. Come on, Lester. It's not a bad jail. Good grub. You'll have the whole place to yourself, and we won't have none of our citizens bothering you. You just go on and wait a second. I'll get you the key, and you can lock yourself up and make it a little easier. My wife will bring you coffee later on. It's right down to the left there. Go ahead, Johnson. You'll be all right. You go on out there and... patrol. I'm going to hang around here for a while. Yes, sir. Some of those people out there are just nuts. They're just nuts. I've got coffee on the stove... I've gotta lock a man up here, who didn't do a damn thing, just to keep those maniacs from killing him. They're not interested in doing nothing but getting drunk and making trouble. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of living here. I'm sick of this job. I just wish we had adopted some children. I'm not going to bring children up over a jail. - Mr. Rogers... - Yes, Ed. - Congratulations on your birthday... - Thank you. What is it? - What's the matter? - Well, it's kind of hard to say... but I felt it was my duty. - Well, there it is. - There what is? I find it very difficult to come here, Mr. Rogers. If it's business at the bank, it can wait till Monday. No, it can't wait until Monday. If it had been about the bank... I would have hardly interrupted your party, an uninvited guest. Edwin, will you get to the point? I've been telling you that for years. Yes, sir. You know... Jake's been having an affair of the heart with Anna Reeves... for a long, long time. Bubber Reeves escaped from jail today, and he's roaming around outside in the country, and they think he killed a man today. I thought you ought to know, because Bubber ain't gonna like Jake having an affair with his wife. If you see what I mean. I mean, a murderer. If you see what I mean, Mr. Rogers. Yeah, I see what you mean. Jake! Jake... There's a fellow in there by the name of Lester Johnson. He's been looking for you, Anna. I think he's got a message from Bubber. Cell two, downstairs. Come on in here. Lots of people running around here tonight who'd be better off at home reading a book, if they could read. You read a book since you been back? Yeah, I read a book. How do you feel about Bubber being back here? You scared? No, are you? Why don't you go on home before your father finds out about you and Anna? I'm going to tell him tomorrow. Well, the best thing about turning over a new leaf on Saturday night is it disappears with a Sunday morning hangover. Well, this one will last. You like the girl? I love the girl. Well, that's gonna be kind of tough. If there's anything I can do for you, Jake, you let me know. Thanks. I won't need it. Well, I might need you before this night's over. Anna? Where's Bubber? Well, Lester just came by to see me, Calder. We've known each other since we were kids, and sometimes when he's broke... I'm going to go home and get it. Slim... Anna Reeves and Jake Rogers are on their way out here. Get on their tail and stay on it till I tell you to quit. You don't have a chance of meeting Bubber, Anna. Not a chance. Where is he? I don't talk to sheriffs, Calder. You oughta know that. Do you know a fellow was murdered in Siddonsville today, and Bubber's being accused of it? Bubber never murdered anybody! I don't believe he would either, but his fingerprints are all over the body. It'd be a whole lot better if he came in here voluntarily. And be punished for something he didn't do? Jake, you got enough money that's not your father's, so as you can get Bubber a good lawyer? Yes, I've got enough money that isn't my father's. Well, then, maybe he's got a good chance. Anna... listen to me, and listen to me real good. I haven't asked for any outside help here tonight, and I should've the first time they spotted Bubber here. I've just been stalling around here waiting for you, hoping you'd help me to get him here. Before those damn people in town find out where he is. If you'd been over to Sol's Café tonight, you'd have seen them. Them monkeys wouldn't like nothing better than to get ahold of a man that they thought was a murderer. I'm the only chance that he's got of going back safe. And I've... I think I've... I've risked something to give him that chance. I'm going to give you one hour to find Bubber and talk him into surrendering, and when you do, I want you to call me. I'll go get him and get him back here safe. And don't be damn fool enough not to call me, because it'll just take a little longer, and then they'll get him. Okay. You got far to go? Some. Well, you'd better walk where you're going and walk fast. The little luck Bubber's had coming to him has run out long before tonight. What's happening? I don't know. Well... if you don't, nobody does. Where do you want me? Forget it. Just keep driving around and turn off that party hat. I... I'd like to see your wife. All right. Ruby, Mrs. Reeves wants to see you. Do you want to see Mrs. Reeves? Come in. I'm scared to death. Please help me. How can I help you? Ask your husband not to harm Bubber if he catches him. He'll send him back to the penitentiary. I want him to go back, but I don't want him hurt. He's sometimes wild, but Bubber's not bad. Maybe I'm to blame for how he is. Now, Monday, I can bring some money... My husband does not want to harm your son. But people say that... Calder, she's been told you'll hurt Bubber if he comes back here. - Who's been saying that? - Everybody. On account of Jake Rogers and Anna Reeves. You know and I know and the town knows that Bubber's wife is Jake Rogers' whore. - Everybody says that... - Well, everybody's wrong, Mrs. Reeves. I wanna help your son. I gave Anna an hour to find Bubber so's he could come back and surrender. - Where is he? - I don't know. Calder, where is Bubber? I want to go to him. I've done so many wrong things to him. Give me a chance to help him. I can make him surrender. He won't trust that whore. I'm telling you, I don't know where he is, Mrs. Reeves. You're lying to me. - Look, I can pay you. - Come on. Now, this is... this is all I have now, but Monday, I'm selling the house to Briggs for $5,000, and I'll give that... Go on, Mrs. Reeves. Get on home now. What's the matter? Isn't my money good enough for you? If it were Val Rogers' money, you'd take it. Well, my money is as good as his money. I love my son as much as he loves his son. Go on. Val Rogers has bought you. He owns your very soul. You're going to kill Bubber to protect Jake Rogers. Shut up, you damn crazy woman! - You're a murderer! - Get the hell out of here! You're a murderer. You're a murderer and a liar! That's what you are, a murderer! Calder is a murderer! He's a murderer and a liar! Val Rogers is his master! He owns him! He bought his soul! He won't listen to me. He's going to try to kill Bubber. I know it. I know it. - I can't listen to that any longer. - Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! You know what? I guess you all are the sexual revolution all by yourselves. You know, I bet that nigger in that jail told him where Bubber is. Hello, Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers, why don't you come have a drink with me? You look tired. - No, thank you. Another time. - Oh, hello, Mr. Rogers. Do you believe in the sexual revolution? My husband does. You keep it up, kid. You just keep it up. Remember when we invited you to our wedding? How many ice ages ago that was. Ice ages... What is all this? There must be a Negro man here in jail who knows where Bubber Reeves is, because... Bubber calls Anna, Anna comes here, and Calder tells her he'll give her one hour to find Bubber. I've heard a strange story. Is it true? Well, if I'm guessing right, it is. Yes, that you gave the Reeves boy an hour to escape? No... I gave Anna an hour to find Bubber and try to get him to surrender. I heard tonight that Jake and Bubber's wife... Is that where he went when he left the party? - Do you know where he is? - I know where he is. He's out with Anna trying to find Bubber. Why aren't you out looking for him instead of sending my son? Because this damn county's 200 miles long and 40 miles wide... and they know where he is, and I don't! I don't have to answer those questions. You do! You are my friend, and I have been good to you, and I would've been better... Hold on! Hold on! Hold it right there, Val. Go on home. You go home. I'm going to sit in this chair and ask myself what I did to get so many people to believe that they could buy me off. I have been told there is a Negro in this jail who knows where Reeves is. Go on home, Val. Is that true? That's none of your damn business. I wanna talk to that man. Come here! Val, wait... Hold on. Hold it right there. I wanna see that Negro. - $100 will make him talk. - I don't care if you've got $500. - Now, don't be bullheaded. - Listen, Val. Stand aside. Hold him still for a few minutes. Have him sit down. Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please! I think hitting the sheriff is against the law. Well, you clowns really want to play. Come on, Calder. Happy birthday. I ain't seen him. - You need $100? - You bet. Who don't? - Lester, I'm in a hurry. - I tell you I don't know. - Be cheating to take the money. - There's more money. - Be cheating even more. - Stop the foolishness. I'm in a hurry! - Nobody has a right to come in here. - Go away, please. Damn it! - Val! - Don't hit me, man! For God's sakes, stop it! He's going to be all right. He's all right. Damn you, Calder! Calder? Cal... Calder? Calder! Calder! Calder! Calder! Calder! Help! Get some help! Get somebody! I told you, man. That's enough! Stop it! That's enough! You could have killed him. Hey, come on. Let's go see Lester. Oh, my God... - Where's Bubber, Lester? - Take it easy, boys. Take it easy! Val Rogers already knows where Bubber Reeves is hiding. Down by Lester's place, up at the wharf. You dirty cowards! Oh, my baby... Sheriff! Sheriff! Hold this. Come on, come on. Hold it, stop walking. Don't walk around. - I'm all right. - Sit down. I'm all right. I'm all right. Slim! Slim! - Don't move! - Yeah, Ruby? Slim, get back to the jail right away. Calder needs you. Don't go. Don't go away. Please sit down. Ruby, I'm all right now. I need your help. Don't make it hard for me. Sheriff... - Did you tell him? - Yeah. - Where is he? - The wharf. Back of the junkyard. Get my coat, there. Get my hat. Wait! Wait for Slim! Let me help you. - Hold on. - No, don't drive. Don't try to drive. - Calder, please. - Go on in there. Get on in there and lock the door. Lock the door. Baby... It's been a long day. It's been a long two years. You all right? Are you? You look good. You look good. I guess I don't look so good. I missed you, Anna. Bubber... Like a lifetime. I wish we could go home... right now. No, no sense to that kind of talk, though, is there? So Lester got to you all right, huh? - No, Bubber, Lester's in jail. - What? Wait a minute. He didn't tell Calder where you were. - He waited for me. - What are you talking about? What is this? Calder's given me an hour. He says you haven't got a chance. The whole state's looking for you. - Calder? - He says he'll get you back safe. - Trust me. There isn't any other way... - Wait a minute. Since when you bring messages from Calder? Bubber... I guess it's big this time. Yeah, it's big. This time, it's really big. You didn't do it. You can't be convicted. No? It don't matter I didn't do it. Something'll go wrong. Listen, I gotta move. How'd you... You got a car? - No. - Anna, I need a car. Bring me some clothes. Go find Jake and have him bring me money and a car. - Bubber... - Come on. Who is that? Jake? Jake? Hey! Hi. So... I'd guessed. It doesn't take much sense to guess. - I always knew. - Bubber... No, hey, don't... Why not? Sure, it don't matter. It doesn't make any difference. Jail took things like that away from me. Maybe for good. Hope not... but maybe. Well, I'll write when I get someplace. - Bubber, you can't... - I'm gonna get someplace. A little luck this time, just a little, huh? I'll send for you. Come if you want, don't if you don't want... I will want. Okay. Okay, Jake? Jake, come on. Where's your car? You won't make a mile. The whole state's looking for you. You know me and cars. The whole state won't find me. - Where is your car? - The car's in town. That's all we could do. We would have been followed here. Okay, go on down and get it. Go on. Listen to me. You've got to have some sense. You can't get away. You didn't kill that guy. You'll say that. Say it, huh? You think I believe in truth and things like that? That's for you, kid. You ain't been to no jail. - This time, we're gonna get you lawyers... - Lawyers? No, you're not. You're not gonna get me nothing. Mm-mmm. I was coming to the end of me. I don't know how I knew it, but I knew it. I was holding on so tight... just a year and three days more. I said to myself, "Anybody can stand that." Then the pork was on the plate, and he said, "Eat it," and I said, "No." He said, "Do you know what this means?" I said, "Nobody's going to make me. It smells, and it's rotten." And up I got. I got right up, and I didn't care what they'd do... because I'd come to the end of me. I said, "Next time anybody talks to me or tries to make me do anything, they're gonna be talking to Bubber Reeves when he's dead." I said, "All right. All right, boy, you're free, because when you're willing to die, nobody can make you do anything anymore." Well, that was night before last. So I'm not going back. There's no chance. I'm not going back. You do what you want, the both of you, but that's the way it's gonna be. Okay... you wait here. Jake! Jake! So Calder gave you an hour, huh? You, your father and who else? Jake! - No, I don't believe it. - Jake, get him out of here. Jake! Jake! Jake, answer me! I know you're out there! I want you to come with me now! Please answer me. I know about you and Anna. Jake? Jake! What's the matter? Go on, do something. What? Bubber Reeves, I know you're out there! God help you if... Bubber, let Jake walk forward... and if... if he's all right, I'll give you my car and see that you get away from here without anybody bothering you! He can do that? Why don't you answer me? Yeah, he can do that. Huh... What a world. - Bubber! - What a world. I warn you, there's not much time! All right, I'm coming. I'm coming. Send Jake out first! - Mr. Val! - Damon, what the hell? We were just worried about you, Mr. Val. You get the hell out of here fast and leave me alone. Get out! Get them out of here too! Get them out of here! Come on, fast! Jake, you and Bubber go over by the embankment across the way. When I get there with my car, make a run for it. I'll take Bubber out by the dirt road. Get the hell out of here! You don't own down here! Hold those cars up there! Hold them cars there, will you? Hey, Charlie! Get out of the way! Come on, come on, come on. Hey, Bubber, remember me? I'm Cutie Bess. Hey, Bubber's back there. Hey, you remember my sister? Let me through! Hey, it's Rogers. Get out of the way! Let Mr. Rogers get through. Get out of the way! - He's got to come out soon now. - Let's burn him out. Hey, give me a bottle. Go! Go! Go! Jake! Jake! Jake! Oh, honey, that's a hell of a way to hold on to a man. Gee, ain't it pretty? Hey, look at that. Isn't that marvelous? Listen, Emily, all this shooting is dangerous. Oh, leave me alone. Drop dead! Now, now, now, now, honey, you just hush up your crying. We want the whole world happy tonight, now, don't we? Don't we? I lost my husband. You lost your husband? Well, now, good for you, sweetheart. I want to drink to that. Jake! Jake!

He sure gave them a run for their money. He's going to need a good lawyer. Maybe he can hire my daddy. He'll need a better lawyer than your daddy. Go on. Bubber. Bubber? Son? Charlie? - Charlie, your mother wants to... - Bubber? Bubber, we're going to sell the house tomorrow, so this time, we can get you a lawyer. Son... I'll do everything I can. Bubber... Come on, boy. Bubber... Bubber. Bubber, I'm sorry for whatever I've done. Believe me, I'm sorry. Say you forgive me. Please? Say you forgive your mama. I'm gonna pray for you now, Bubber Reeves. - I'm gonna pray for you. - You'll do a whole lot better over here. There's the son of a bitch that's caused everything. Calder! Calder! - What is it? - Get out of here! - Calder! - Calder! What happened? What happened? All right. All right. Oh, my God. Oh. Calder, let's go. Come on. My son died at 5:00.
