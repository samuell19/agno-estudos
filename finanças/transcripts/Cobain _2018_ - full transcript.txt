- Hurry up, guys. - Okay. Patrick, I'm not going to stay with my mother after all. Okay, rub it off the board then. It's your last day. Are you doing anything? No, I may go into town. Did Mia call? No. Hey, kid. Does Mia still come here ever? No. No, she doesn't. She's mad at us. If you're pregnant, everyone interferes. She doesn't like that, does she? Where are you these days? In South, but I'm going to a foster family. - Are you with Patrick? - Yes. - You know him? - Yes, we were at school together. - Darius, that's far enough. We had a deal. - Sure, a deal. Only this far and we'd rather you took it all outside. Hey, Niels. Where's your mother? Can you open the door for me? Come on. Can't she stay with you? No. If only very briefly. No, Cobain, that... that's impossible. I've got Niels now. I have to go. She's having a baby! What kind of friend are you? Hey, stop right there! Don't move. Come with us. Cobain? Are you still there? You really don't want to go? Cobain. You thought they were nice, didn't you? I saw them once. But it felt good, didn't it? - How do I know? We'll see. - We'll see? We'll see? If that man had reported you. D'you know how difficult it is at your age? We've spent weeks on that family. You promised Mia would come. Where is she? I understand you're disappointed. So am I. - I'm going to the toilet. - No, sit down and listen. Sit down. If you don't cooperate, you'll be locked up until you're 18. The boys are still at school. Long day... Okay. Do you like green beans? - Do you like them? - They're okay. Beetroot? Come with me. Lift that leaf up. I missed that one so I'll let it grow now. - Can it grow even bigger? - Yes, more than a metre. I was thinking, if you like... you could help me with the garden. Okay. - Those are raspberries. - Hello! - You're already here! - Yes. Welcome. - You saw the green monster? - Yes. Now for the refrain. Do you make music too? No. Do you perform anywhere? Some times. Why are you called Cobain? My mother. I think it's a great name. It's an awful name. Everyone writes it wrong and who gets named after a guy who shot himself? Hey, it's me. Where are you? Can I come and stay with you? I can? Okay, where are you? My little man. You really shouldn't project things on me. But how will you do it? Well? Where will you leave him? Please be serious, Mia. Get lost, Cobain, you make me nervous. I'm going that way. Why do you follow me like a lapdog? I'm just worried about you. Do I worry about you? Well then? I'm me and you're you. We're both okay, okay? I'm going that way. Cobain, can you come and help me? I have to move the tables. Hi darling. - What are you doing? Scouring it? - Cleaning it. Cleaning it? Did they put you to work? - You want to play soccer too? - With this? Can you imagine? Maybe in goal. Come on, kid. My footballer. Have you warmed up? You stretched? Go on! Get him, get him! That's my son. No, that sausage looks awful. No. I don't want that. Just eat it. - You want sausage? - No, thanks. Hey, you're sitting on my bag! What? Let's see. Such lovely veins. Darling, are you grilling? Chicken? - Shouldn't you stop? - Why? I just got here! Act normal. Come on! Just come and dance with your mother, kid! - Here, have a sip. - No thanks. - Of course you can. - No. You won, you have to celebrate. The official part is over. You can stay if you like, but clear up afterwards. Shit, that greasy sausage! Oh, I'm completely stuffed. Fucking baby. Hey Cobain, what are you up to? Clearing up! You have a drink? My mouth tastes acid. Hey! What are you up to? Clearing up. Cool it. We haven't finished ye t. We haven't? You should go home. You're drunk. I'll go home when I want. Oh yeah? So where will you go? What do you mean? You know. - Calm down, darling. - Hey. Are you starting too? That's great. I'll come watch soccer again some time. Mind your own business, you. - Dammit, that kid is always complaining. - Fuck you! - What? You can't do this! - Why not? I don't understand you, boy. Bitch! You fucking bitch! I hate you! - You go and cry, boy. Go on. - Shut up! Never mind. - Calm down. - Never mind. Fuck you. Go away. Get lost. Get lost! You want another drink? No, I've had enough. Okay. One more. Up to the second floor. - Upstairs? - It's hard work, isn't it? Awkward. An awkward thing. Put it down here. It takes strength. It was expensive. Hungry? Jadwiga... Maybe a cup of coffee? Yogurt? Enjoy. Thanks, sweetheart. Hey, Cobain. How old are you now? - Fifteen. - Fifteen? Fifteen? You haven't grown much. How's your mother? Not bad. Hey Adele. - Adele, say hello to the boy. - Hi boy. Hi boy. It's Cobain. Hallo Cobain. His mother lived here. Centuries ago. How is she? Not bad. No. I mean how is she? She's having another baby. Okay. I get it. So you thought you'd come and see Wickmayer? I thought maybe I can work for you. You want to work? Okay. Hey, you look like a dog searching for a boss. And you stink. He smells. Those are your things? Time hasn't been kind to me either. Come on, let's put that fucking machine together. Are you handy? We are here. - Good luck. - You too. See you later. The cash. It's pretty busy. - Everything okay? - Yeah. And you? Not too many checks? - You have to get up. - What are you doing? Go! Adele? Wake up. You have to wake up. Go away. Do you mind...? Can you do the missionary? Then it's time for experiments. You don't understand? - I didn't understand you. - No? Nothing? - What? - Nothing? The missionary. Did you understand? - Do you have the missionary... - Do you...? - Do you have the missionary... - Missiona... Stop laughing. - What is it called? - Mike. I mean, what kind of animal it is? Small and green. You'll have to feed it once in four days. - Me? - Yes. - Okay. - What... What should I give him? Vegetable. - This? - Yes. Can I open it? Well, it bites. Please. Here we go. - Enjoy. - Thanks! I do it with these sexy socks. Come on, Cobain. He can't even light a cigarette. Cobain? Cobain? Look now, comedian. What is it? Well? Look what I found. What do you want? Jesus, Mia. You can say that again. So this is where you're hiding? How are you? Fine. What about you? I'm coping. I went to Eindhoven for a bit. And now I'm back here. - Are you with Serge? - Fuck Serge. Let's go and have a drink together? Ah shit. I feel dizzy. - I have to go. - Fuck. You have to leave. I'll get in trouble. It's here. - How long since his wife died? - Two years. But I can't see him coming home any more. No. That's over. He's in a bad way. - Thank you. - Fine. My pleasure. Look at this. All neat and tidy. Incredible. Will you empty the fridge too? - What? - The fridge. Will you empty it too? - Do you know Kurt Cobain? - Yes of course. He is my father. For real? Yes. You look a bit like him. You have to go. - Was it better now? - Much better, yes. Oh God. - Why are you here? What's up? - Why didn't you call me? - Hello. - Hi Mia. You were going to call? Why are you here? - I've got a problem. - What did you think? You'd come to take a look? She just dropped by. - How are you? - Nearly there, eh? - Cobain is enjoying it here. - He is? - He can make up his own mind. - Aren't you, Cobain? So why doesn't he call me anymore? That's a coincidence, I suppose. - Why do you think that is? - Mia. Why are you interfering, man? He still has his black chicks? He loves them. - Mia. - He's a pimp, surely you know that. - Go away, junkie! - Fine. I'm going. And you don't even defend me when he badmouths me. He still has back trouble? You know what causes that, don't you? You have to get out, that guy is weird. - Do you happen to have any money? - No, sorry. Shit. - I'll call you, okay? - Yes, that's fine. I didn't ditch you. It's just because everyone interferes with us. We'd be much better off, just the two of us. Come on. What did she want? Money, I suppose. No thanks. Listen, kid. She isn't worth it. She won't stay on the straight and narrow. They'll find her dead by the road one day. After she gets herself another one like you. It's my mother you're talking about. Really? No, sorry. You call that a mother? I don't call that a mother. She's just a hole you crawled out of. Shut up, fucking bastard! Yes, again. Yes, very clear. Would you like to feel? Come over here. Let's see. Put your hand here. Go on. Can you feel it? Jeez. - Had you lost blood before? - Only at first. - I'll write a prescription. You must get it. - I must, I must! I want you to start on methadone at once. Okay... Is that all? We have to leave. You can't have a baby that way. You're losing blood, the cervix is unstable and your blood pressure is too low. You're all worrying too much. He'll find his way out, really. It worked out with him, didn't it? It's not just about you. I'd rather have you in hospital. - Can I go to the toilet? - Yes. Second door on the left. Where did she go? Which way did that pregnant woman go? Where were you? With Mia. Come on. Where were you? - Seeing the doctor. - The doctor. Seeing the doctor. Yes. I understand. Seeing the doctor, but the question is now... what do I have to do with the doctor? I want you to be there if I need you. Cobain, come on. Hey, Cobain. Cobain. I want you here if I need you. Understand, Cobain? - Do you? - Yes. I don't want to see that filthy junkie around here. She isn't worth it. You know what they should do? They should put her out of her misery. Shut up, you bastard! Shut up! - You can't say that! - What can't I say? You can't say that! Leave him alone. Enough. - Stop. It's enough! - Okay. Stop. Let him. Let him. Stop. My God. Are you OK? Do you need something? I have to go. Mia. Mia, Iook at me. Look at me. Are you leaving already? Stay a little longer. You're tickling. Turn over. Cobain! Is that you? Cobain. Cobain! Is that you? Open the door! Open the door! Where were you? - Let me pass. - No. What do you mean? You locked me up. - You need peace, Mia. - Cobain, have you gone mad? Go on! I'll look after you. - I can cook, do the dishes. - Let me pass, I'm going home. - Which home? - Let go of me. You can't lock me up. Listen. I brought methadone. What do you mean? You have to stop using that shit. You heard the doctor? I don't care about the fucking doctor. It's no good for the baby. How often do I have to tell you? It's my fucking baby. Leave me alone, Cobain. I'm going to help you. I can't be helped. Don't you get it? We'll stay here till the baby comes. And when the time comes, we'll go to hospital. That's impossible. You want to break me, don't you? Why are you doing this to me? Why have you locked me up? Otherwise you'll just run away. Run away. I don't even know where I am. - How much did you do? - Four. It's not helping, Cobain. I'm feeling so cold. Oh, I don't want any more. I'm full. I feel so cold. Silence. What's in there? Wood or something? Nice curls. Is that a spider or a mosquito? Both. That's impossible. Ah, there are two of them. Two of them. They're fighting. Have you thought of a name? An ordinary name? What? Tom, Dick or Harry? - I think Ruben is nice. - Ruben? Why Ruben? I don't know. Ruben. My little man. Sorry. Never mind. My little man. You're my little man. Cobain! Cobain! Cobain!! What's the matter? I don't feel well. I don't feel well. I'll get something for you. Cobain! Cobain! My belly. My belly hurts! - What? - My belly, my belly! Okay, we'll go to hospital. Take it easy. Cobain, don't leave me! Fuck. What have you done? I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding. Keep calm. Hey, Mia. I'm here. I'm with you. Keep calm. It'll be okay.
