1st July, I am visiting Kin, my patient. Kin told me he loves riding on ferry. Though HK is a port, people have no time to admire it. They love taking underground train instead... ...just because it is fast. Kin said though his parents are divorced, they do have one thing in common. They always say: hurry up... Kin always asks: why hurry up? If people always hurry up, won't they have shorter life? If we hurry up, we never see things clearly... ...those things which we always think are worthless... ...including the harbour of HK. Modern people are greedy. God gives us so much but we always it insufficient. I remember an insect, which keeps rolling soil. I don't remember their name. People of HK are like those insects. They reclaim much of the land. It is said that HK people can perform miracles. Run?! Where can you run? Pick the stuff up! Help! Help! Sir, what is it? Pick up the polyfoam, now! You said that guy is not mad? What does he take this place is? This guy deserves dying, he is lunatic. The man was eating lunch quietly, but he pushed him down to sea. Do you think he is nuts? Hello, yes. The witness is giving her testimonial. Yes, okay... Sorry, Miss, I forget about you. Hey, where were we? You said he pushed the man down the sea. Then a policeman chased him, asking him to pick up the polyfoam. Sorry, a patient is waiting for me, I have to hurry. Read it and sign it if there's no problem. Thanks. Okay, it is done. Thanks, you may leave now. Pick up the polyfoam! He is a nuts, everyone in the station knows this. You are really in bad luck. He still thinks polyfoam can ruin the Earth. Smash-head! You get out! Miss, what are you doing? Nothing. Don't stand here if there's nothing. What is on? What are you up to? Go in my room! Come with me. Have one. It is too big. Come on, you can. I am used to small ones. Give me a small one. It is boring. Play with a club, it is funnier. What is it? You go and dance. They have wrinkles all over, I won't play with them. I mean to bring you to see them. You'll soon become like this, you know. People from Complaint Bureau will come for you tomorrow. What is it? Did that bastard complain against me? Officer Lam, the person-in-charge, knows me well. I have talked to him, everything will be fine. Man, it's very borring! Can you play some other tunes?! Thank you! Boss, Smash-head is really mad. He points his gun at others easily. I fear he'll make us involved. But he is brave enough to do what you dare not. He dare not disobey me, don't worry. I helped him in the case about his killing the female hostage... ...but for me, he couldn't have got off responsibility. I'm Sergeant Lam Wai Leung. I'm in charge of the case about you. On 2nd July, a person named Chu Kin Hong complained against you. Sir, I know you will go into every case. Yet, I've written every detail in my report. That Chu Kin Hong can't be a good guy anyway. He's a pimp, not social worker, why listen to him? Many eye-witnesses said you didn't show your identity, you just pointed your gun at Chu Kin Hong, then pushed him into sea. First of all, I don't know what you mean by showing identity. I was gun-fighting with Wavy-hair, I had just fixed that guy. I then looked around to see if there were other culprits. Then I spotted this guy. He started running away so I chased him. He jumped into the sea himself, I didn't push him. We've just settled the case you killed the female hostage... ...and now you stirred up another trouble. Those reporters will make up stories again. I remember we found 6 powerful guns... ...and 2 pistols, with about 100 bullets at Wavy-hair's place. We also found a girl he had just taken hostage from. I think this is enough for the newspapers, right? Officer Chow, Officer Lam, do you agree? Hey, what are you doing? What is it? - What are you doing? - I ask you what's on! Nothing, it's okay. Okay, go on drinking, I'll pay this round. Don't be angry, it's okay. Never mind him, let's drink on. Come on. No, no way... Mandy... What again? Call my name first. What again? I don't want, you're bad. Why are you wearing tie? What are these? Slippers. Why are you wearing plastic slippers? Why must you wear plastic slippers?! Why can't I wear plastic slippers? Those plastic... created a hole in the sky. A hole in the ozone layer, bitch! I like it! I like whatever you don't like. - Go to hell! - Go away!... Go away, take your underwear away. Let's drink on! Imagine you're in a safe, comfortable place. Here, you don't need any tools to cover yourself. Just put your worry away. Put all your burden down, just relax yourself... - Quiet. - What is it? What is it? I ask you to keep quiet. What?!... Open up the calendar in your mind. Open it to the place you want, to search for the thing you want. Who are you looking for? Police. Oh! You are looking for Dr. Leung. She is inside. But you better wait outside. I'm busy. I'm going to market to buy something. I don't know what are you talking about. Tell me what you ate yesterday? Hamburger. Is hamburger delicious? Yes. When is it you last ate a hamburger? Around the middle of June. You still remember so well? Let's go back to even earlier. - Okay? - Yes. Tell me when did your belly start aching? On Wednesday of the examination. On Wednesday of the examination? It's the Wednesday of the examination when in P.1 What did you do on that Wednesday? I was at father's place... Mom, my belly aches... - I want mother!... - Be good... Your belly aches on Wednesday. Now think about Tuesday, what did you do? I... I was revising lessons at home. Your belly didn't ache when revising lessons? No. Okay, get up and revise lessons. You said every Saturday you take Kin to see his father. Yes, I recall it now. That day was Wednesday, Kin had a long holiday. His father said he'd take him to eat seafood. After eating, he said his belly ached, I rushed to see him. I spent the night accompanying him. You know, a man doesn't know how to look after children. I know what's wrong with Kin now. He will recover soon? No, I only find out the reason by hypnotising him. He must come for more sessions. Then he'll recover. What more sessions? Okay, I'll tell you after these sessions. Do you love chatting with me? Yes. Come again in a few days, okay? Sure. You must revise lessons well, okay? Say goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Kin feels belly aches as of subconsciously. A scientist once fixed instrument on a flock of sheep. Whenever they jumped over fence to eat grass, they'd be electrocuted. After several months, these sheep cramped whenever they saw fence. Divorce of parents is like instrument fixed on sheep. Children can't resist, but he knows belly aching can fight against being electrocuted. So when he goes to his father's place, his belly aches. Will what say be passed to the Court? You've belly ache too? So you picked it, thanks. Can hypnosis help recall forgotten things? It can also find out the long-term lies one cheating himself. It's very simple, close your eyes, give me your hands. Let me hold your hands and lead you out. This is the first step to make confidence in me. Why fear? Don't you trust me? Why don't you doctor wear bra? When mankind first learnt about shaking hands, they opened both arms to show their friendship, so that the other side saw he had no weapon in hands. You don't even know the simplest way of showing friendship. You can't be hypnotised. Construction work above, be careful. Got it. Hello! Officer Lee! This is Tall-man! I'm in Central right now, a chap follow me and I don't know who's he. Looking for a coffee shop and take a rest, okay? I've found a coffee shop. It's busy inside, he wouldn't use force at me. What's the matter buddy? - Run? Where can you run? - Stop punching me... I've report to police, they'll arrive soon. Report to police?! You want police? I've received your port, what do you want to complain? Sir, what exactly do you want? It's summer, where are you running to? It's summer, you like running? Your boss asked me to tell you to mind your words in Court. You mustn't bullshit or you can never speak anymore. I've given statement to ICAC, how can I alter it? Just pretend you lose your memory, you know... Must I punch you to make you lose your memory? Do you know what means by losing memory? Yes, I know... Hello, is it Smash-head? You've come? You are punctual. Where are you now? I'm waiting for you in hell. Dare you come join me? Who is it? I'm hanging up now. Welcome to hell! Good. Be good. What's happened to that guy? Nothing, that guy dare not speak again, okay? What's wrong? Go whoring? Pay for the whore? No whores are being forced nowadays. Honey. Does he look like a bastard? Just try and we'll know. Help me try it. Hello? Wrong number? Shit! I have moved away, Sir. Right above Beautiful Restaurant in Western. Who called? Hello? Hey! Wrong number! For me? Hello? Okay, you made the call just then? Come out, I have to talk to you. I have to talk to you too. Stop asking me to serve your bosses. I don't love rich men. You thought you were Fatty Chuen? You're not an example of policeman. Today is Mandy's birthday, no one can leave! Let's join the party! Hurry, we're late. Don't fire! There's hostage inside! Don't worry, it'll be fine, I'll help you out. What is it, head? Block the scene! Call the HQ. Yes, Sir! What are you doing? This guy is a real bastard. He jumped and killed himself, his will is more than 10 pages. How come he had so much to complain against me? It's so many months now. The couple mean to act against me. They killed themselves one by one just to tease me. Damn it! Sorry... In fact, you want most to... ...say "I'm sorry", right? Could you let this window opened? Sure. Relax yourself. Can you relax yourself? Imagine you're in a safe, comfortable place. Here, you don't need any tools to cover yourself. Just put your worry away. Put all your burden down. Make yourself feel very light... You feel weightless, care free. Open up the calendar in your mind. Open it to the place you want, to search for the thing you want. Relax yourself, open all the joints. You don't need fists here. Because this is a safe place, no one will hurt you. You needn't worry about pollution, Mr. Earth is still clean. You're in a very comfortable status now. Just tell me whatever you think of. There's no one else in this space. Imagine you're comfortable now. Just sleep and leave all your burden. I must carry a gun even when sleeping. Come again when you have confidence in me. Why must I trust you? He wasn't responsible for killing the female hostage. But his conscience makes himself feel guilty. I don't know whether he is a good policeman or not, but I know he comes to me. Because he wants to make himself honest by hypnosis. The first time I saw him I felt that he's resisting something. Doctor is most regretful... ...when he can't help a patient. I feel that he's fighting against all odds by himself. I feel that he's very lonely. What kind of gun is this? Every year so many robber and policemen die. We've so much of them, we give them out and stir up trouble. We use things to the most, very environmental saving. That tall man dare not bullshit after I punch him hard. Why must you stir up so much thing? His boss doesn't trust him, and must make him mute in Court. He has the money, you can't do anything to him. Ask Snake to give the gun to Vietnamese Guy. I don't want to flatter that rich man. You want others to say I can't order the people under me? Something's going on. I've informed the HQ, shall we take action? Police! Freeze! Smash-head! Thanks for your gun. The serial number of your gun is... 9413, it's my lucky number. You're Smash-head? Where's the gun? What else can you do besides Killing? What did you say? We HK people spend billions of dollars on you assholes. What did you say?! What did I say? I said you're lazy. You kill someone just for $5,000. Give you gun, take it, take it! My partner Fatty Chuen's salary was $10,000 before he died. He worked as hard as a dog. Why did you kill him?! Who did that?!... Don't get excited. We suspect he was killed by his own gun. Maybe someone snatched his gun and killed him. Colleague, I come to collect my gun. Warrant card. Please. This is my new partner, Ko Chin Man. Morning, Brother Man. Call me Smash-head, everyone calls me that. Smash-head. Raymond Kar was bribed and asked me to beat the witness. Warned him not to say anything against boss of the Security Company. They have someone in between called Jim as contactor. This Jim has got involved in many transactions of Officer Kar. The dirty money Officer Kar gives me every month... ...is more than my salary. Officer Lam, you know this very well. I must detain your warrant card and your gun. You're being suspended before the case closes. Do you trust me? Close your eyes. Give me your hands, let me lead your way. Now that you don't trust me, how can I trust you? Take me to your world. Fatty Chuen and I used to drink here. Being policeman, we have to contact scoundrels, murderers. To understand them, we must act like them. So that we can know what's in their mind. That's why Fatty Chuen came here for half hour every day. He said he could resume normal here. But since he died... I've only come here once. And that's after I killed the female hostage. I think I can't resume normal as Fatty Chuen. I've stood here half day, but I can't resume normal. I only want to jump down. There's a disease, let's call it "Painless Symptoms". Because of deficiency of nervous system... ...the agony signal can't be emitted to the brain. Whenever he hurts himself or when he's injured, he doesn't feel painful at all. I reckon that this must be very good. As I never suffer from pain in my life. However, pain is an alert for danger. It will inform us... ...that our body has been injured, that we must be careful. In the process of growing, we try to become indifferent to pain. We think this will make us strong. You feel pain as you feel there's danger. I learn all this from books. I don't expect I can sense it so near. What is it? This girl is mine. Is she? - Yes. Are all girls in this pub yours? Hey, what's wrong? This is not. Want to try the way we drink? Go to hell! Go to hell! Stop fighting! Beat him! Drop your gun, drop it! They're all gone. Are you okay? Does it hurt? No, when one is excited. He doesn't suit you. What's your name? Chan Tai Fai. Your address? Tai Kwok Tsui. How old are you? Just a little scratch. A little scratch? It's all smashed. It's nothing. What do you mean by now? Hostesses of all sizes, of all nationalities. Come up. Before I came back to HK... ...many friends told me HK is dirty. I thought an island can't be really dirty. The truth is... ...the harbour is filled with garbage, but the night view is terrific. I only don't remember how long I haven't seen it. You know, you make people recall... ...something one has forgotten. Officer Kar... Fix it. Smash-head makes me disappointed. I thought he was clever. But he's as stupid as Fatty Chuen. He's stupid. Who is Fatty Chuen? His late former partner. HK is an economics city. Whoever stops others making money must fade out. Aren't I correct? Hello, is it Snake? Smash-head is with that psychologist. He's with the psychologist? He's sick? He's taken too much hemp? Catch him, let me teach him a lesson. Why did you become a policeman? At the era when Magaret Thatcher slipped and fell down... ...I finished high school, I held my report card in my hands... ...and wandered alone. I didn't know why I studied, I walked to the seaside and saw a woman crying. She cried hard. She suddenly jumped into the sea. I saw her struggling... ...then knew that she didn't want to die. I wanted to rescue her. But the waves made me scared. Soon a policeman rushed there and undressed himself. He handed me his gun and asked me to keep it. He jumped into the sea... ...and swam to the woman. He reached there finally. But the waves hit him hard. He didn't let go... I found that he was very brave. Mandy Tell the owner Office Kar knows where they are, dangerous. No? Really busy? Okay, goodbye. Are you alright? I'm fine. Thanks. You've waken up? What did I say? Many things. Hello, who is it? Your call. What is it? Nothing, let me see you home. I want to see another friend, something might happen to her. Smash-head, let me go... Goodbye. Carmen. I'm sure you recognised me at the first glance. You told me when you were being hypnotised. What else did I tell you? Many inhuman things, but really attractive. Bye-bye. Good night. Hello? Hello. It's me. Promise me, don't let yourself go into danger. Besides knowing why you became a policeman... ...I also want to know many things about you. This is for you, much better than a bouquet. You always sleep with Smash-head? I made love with him, but didn't sleep. What kind of person is he? No idea, I didn't talk much with him. Has he mentioned about me? I've had enough. Enough? You know, HK Police Force has the largest supply of drug. All this stuff is pure. Free of charge. For your sake. I've had enough! Don't you know you're not lovely at all now? I love it when you get excited. This is... This is all for you. Where are you going? Come here! Sit down. It's hot tonight. It may rain soon. Don't waste it, take it all. Take it or I'll be angry. I still feel sober after being drunk. I wanted to ask him when first met him. When we became acquainted, he wanted nothing. I've given all to him. Really, I've given all to him... I've given all to him. I now know why Smash-head always comes for you. You're that kind of woman who can be dumped easily. No one finds it upset to forget you. It's the perfect night for you to commit suicide. 20th July, as of self-protecting instinct, a wounded animal is most furious. This is my first impression of him. Today, he receives my hypnosis the first time. He recalls why he became a policeman? Why did he become a policeman then? Was it for money? What is it, doctor? Then do you know... ...how a predator behaves? It's cool, but a little excited. The whole body is in ready position. Doctor, you're quite attractive. What do you mean? Smash-head doesn't have a chance to tell you my things. I'm not bad to him, but he forces me too much. He's only a mad dog, he's not up to me. He may have told you his ability. Though he hasn't told me anything. I know he's holding you by the balls. Who's calling Smash-head? His doctor. Tell him his friend asks after him on behalf of Mandy. If he doesn't want Mandy's incident to happen again, he must show up at once. Come with me. Where to? Come for a ride with me. I'm Sergeant Ko Chin Man. I find a female body in Science Museum Road. Send men at once. Miss, I don't have time to talk to you. A woman has died, I don't want a second body. Where do you want to go? Maybe it's your last night today. You decide. Calm down... Calm down and think about the phone number of your partner, or you can't rescue Carmen. Relax now. Imagine you are in a... ...safe and comfortable place. Open up the calendar in your mind... The place we live is not safe at all! It's a reclamation land from garbage! We're sinking soon! We're not at all in a safe place. Again... Whatever is going on... Whatever is going on, it's none of your business. No one can change. The only thing you can do is to rescue Carmen. Imagine you're in a safe, comfortable place... Relax yourself, Imagine you're in a safe, comfortable place. Open the calendar in your mind to 1st July. From the day you first met me. Can you help me get back this address? I remember Jim called up Officer Kar. I hate Officer Kar, I dislike him. Every time he appears, he makes me think of the female hostage. I hate the way he behaves confidently. I hate Chris Pattern. As Fatty Chuen died the day he reported duty to HK. Why did you become a policeman? Smash-head is not as brave as I expect. Do you think he won't come? No, you don't understand him so you suspect him. I know what's in his mind. - Hello? - Officer Kar. I've told you many times not to call me up. I don't want to but someone points me with a gun. Hello, Officer Kar. Human brain is wonderful. No wonder scientists say modern people are too lazy. We store everything in computer, not in our mind. We only use up one-tenth of our brain capability. So all we've seen or heard is stored in our brain. We can retrieve it with suitable way. However, your partner doesn't use his mind. He stores all your dirty deeds in computer, including the data of the cruel Vietnamese guys. What do you want? You're not ill, the doctor is useless to you. Let's exchange she and the computer data. Okay, go to your favourite pier. Okay, see you latter. Carmen! Smash-head! Smash-head, have you read the newspaper? We've caught Wavy-hair, and found more than 10 guns. We also rescued the girl. But that only appeared in papers once. And you, you injured Wavy-hair. And you even pushed him down the sea. They wrote stories about you for two days. They also invited experts... ...saying about human rights. Those political parties came out barking too. Saying we have too much rights. They mentioned the case you killed the female hostage again. But no one thinks, if the one who rushes out is a robber... Smash-head! Smash-head! We can't hesitate for one second or we'll be killed. Leave that, let go that woman. I love your manner. It's like before, when we could discuss everything. I'm too careless. I shouldn't use Fatty Chuen"s gun this time. His soul must be pastering you. We used to enjoy peace. I should have thought of your killing Fatty Chuen. He hindered in my way. I can use you if I killed him. Bastard. Many people gives this remark to you too. Do you know, in many people's mind... ...you and I are the same body. You can sleep with this woman, but you needn't make a dream. You think you're smart? Let me tell you, if I'll give you one more chance, you'll still fire that shot. If I can choose, I won't accept your false testimonial. I'd rather face the Court. What are you doing? Open fire, come on. You dare not? Come on, shoot me. Who will you choose, this woman or yourself? You needn't choose, I've decided for you. Give me the stuff or I'll kill you too. Do you hear? I will kill you too! How are you? Do you know what you have just said? You said: I want to get near her, but I might be injured. I'm not scared. Love has no choice. I've sent this message into your mind. You can't run away. I won't run away. I think Mr Earth can bear this. Let our children live on... ...one generation to one generation, peacefully.
