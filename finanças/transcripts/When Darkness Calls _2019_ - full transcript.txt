okay, hi Tina, nice to see you again Nice to see you So, now when we talked last time we had activity in your dinning room, you had things thrown at you from the kitchen, you had activity in your basement, and you've had activity in your attic where your daughters stay now I know you said that Jeremy's come back a couple times to investigate, has did he find anything, did you hear anything, did he show you anything Yah What they show yah um they put a spirit box in the middle of this table and we had speakers so we hooked them up and whenever he was talking to him he got real aggressive towards them and they got aggressive back they started and growling they started making weird like low deep you know I'm talking about voices yeah okay and then he kept agging it and agging it on and it called him the B word and then he kept doing it and it called him the A word, three times okay then he asked what it was that it was looking for that it can't have and it said my name it says, it says your, did you hear your name come out of the spirit box yeah we all did Wow, was it clear yeah really yeah - now after that what else has been going on? - there, you can hear people walking up stairs all the time all day all night yeah just and you might even hear while you're here ok because that happens pretty often the tray like you were talking about before got thrown from off the wall hanging on a nail and hit me and hit mom The Their, I used to put a dish drainer on and nail by the refrigerator and it's thrown been thrown out at me more than once I know we had, have you had anymore experiences in the basement? I don't go down there mom I don't know she has but I will not go down there now because whenever Jeremy was here and they did what they did I don't know what they did but I can't be by that basement door I don't like it and I don't like going upstairs but that's worse does it give you an uneasy feeling? yeah I'm uncomfortable I don't even like looking down there and be old home owners were the ones who played with a Ouija board in here who told you that um, they did ok the one of the people that used to play with it here there was a in my room there was a cubby hole underneath the steps and that's where they played with it what about the guy that committed suicide upstairs? that is actually somebody I know one of my friends her child her teenage son committed suicide by jumping over the rail and he hung himself um upstairs it's just a heavy feeling because I my bedrooms upstairs and Keeley's is upstairs um Keeley has nightmares that she doesn't know why she doesn't know what they are she just will wake up and be startled and comes and gets in my bed and Zane and Keeley have nightmares and now I have to have Zane on two different types of medicines because his anxiety has what about your daughters? she will have night she's she's been acting out lately like bad like screaming she'll just scream and get angry and she has been getting progressively worse and she is not like that, thats not her ok Tina's work bench down here Seriously crap There it is Yup Yah he's down here messing with stuff you will here it, tap tap tap he definitely tinkers with stuff around here that's not good that's almost like a mini portal thing going on he likes going in and out I don't like that that's really bad we can close that it goes straight through I can see it you just see the swirling energy it is the strangest shit I don't like it I could bring some really bad stuff in So far they've got gotten lucky I think but he's down here quite often messing with stuff hammers nails whatever sounds like he's hammering and making doing whatever we'll hear him kicking this stuff banging in a wall and he's standing right there he don't like me, he don't like me at all I'm not suppose to know that nope, he wants me out, um yup I can hear it but yah he, he comes down here quite often you can have them I won't deal with them yeah he's not down here as much as he is upstairs but he is definitely down here messing with stuff I don't know, sometimes if if I feel like he grabs somebody's feet sometimes reaches through just jack while I'm coming down they feel like they're being chased up and was tripped coming down or they're shoved but he likes to kind of reach through and just kind of stick his hand out and grab and then you're like going but, you catch yourself he thinks it's funny you get scared and then you want to bolt upstairs because you feel something else coming at you and that's him he's come around and he's coming at you from the front so that's Yah, there's something somebody in here but it's like he doesn't want me in the space at all it's like this is his stay the hell out you don't want me in here is it the old man that was downstairs no it like a a teenager and I think he's a little fearful he comes across as a shadow but it's not a true shadow person who's just kind of hiding in the shadows because something piece of cloth and he doesn't want to cross over because he's afraid he's gonna be Judged that is actually somebody I know one of my friends um her child her teenage son committed suicide by jumping over the rail and he hung himself I don't think he means mess with anybody he just feels like this was his home or he visited here a lot and this is where he's comfortable and their doesn't mean to really scary anybody but there might be something else there's an older guy he messes with the boy he messes with him a lot because he does not like kids at all, does not want anything to do with the kids but he's he's kind of like almost trying to be your protector at the child keep the old man away but the old man is overpowering because his energy is stronger so, and we got he likes to lay down out here every now and then he'll mess with whoever's out here but it's not intentional thats the mom, or the grandma it is so not intentional he just gets comfortable he gets tired too but he also kind of drains whoever is here of the energy but again I don't think it's intentional at all I don't think he really realizes that he's he's draining it this might have been where the old man took kids, and messed with them kind of hiding I don't know, again he was about thin white hair and he's probably about so high so tall not real big kind of like a small build for a for a man I think and I don't think that that teenagers death was an accident I don't think it was an accident you think somebody pushed him or do you think it was suicide I think it was set up to look like suicide set it up to look like suicide yeah yeah it's really do that's what I said the first time we were here I really really feel like it what it was set up to be suicide now were dealing with a lot of the residual to it's making me ill that teenager likes that room and it the old man use to take kids in there and is that why he I think he locked them in there and punished them to is that why he messes with the little boy so much highly possible he's just he does not like kids does not kid don't mind they don't mind they don't do what the hell they're told and it makes him hate him even more he's like they just fall in line, do what they suppose to do maybe their wouldn't be an issue but anything we do with this guy their is going to be an issue because nothing is right, nothing is, he's a perfectionist he's always going to find fault in whatever the hell is going on now he's been here for quite quite a while, quite a while I just he likes these stairs that's why I sit when I go down he he likes sitting he likes messing he messes with people around him it's like they lose their equilibrium or something and start to slip and feel like they're falling but they're not falling he just really messes with him he messes with the energy he messes with what's going on that's what he did to me the first time I was here and that's why I remember the first time we come up that's why I sat down when we went back downstairs I told you that that's what that's why I do that cause yah that guy is not nice he's pretty nasty he likes to hide up there he goes downstairs but that's where he freakin hides point, and I think he's also in the basement I think this person whoever whoever sleeps in here has seen somebody either at the foot of their bed and possibly over them and they've had their blankets messed with tucked pulled and I think they felt like kick into the bed in a hard jolt enough to wake them up out of a dead sleep there's a lot of knocking and banging and scratching yeah I think it's old man its a old man he's just trying to scare everybody he wants them out doesn't like them hello do you remember me from the last time shit you okay yah, found the okay whatever that bucket is cat liter yeah is that the cat liter yeah it's got you mapped out but thats it yeah do you know the little girl that this is her room do you like her yah she's a sweet little girl that was my throat could you please
