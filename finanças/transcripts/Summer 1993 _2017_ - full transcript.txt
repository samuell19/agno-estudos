One, two, three, red light, green light! One, two, three, red light, green light! You're dead! Why aren't you crying? You're dead! I love this dress. It's from Morocco. There's a lot from there. I know. You can keep it. I think it's tacky. Esteve, play Neus' song. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. And forgive us your sins... - Our sins. Our sins... as we forgive those who sin against us. And lead us not into temptation. Lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. In the name of The Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. This is from your mom's first communion. With this, you'll feel she's close. Remember, you need to pray the Our Father every night. Lola, why aren't you coming? I can't, love. But we'll come and visit in few days, okay? Okay? Don't upset me, son. Be sure to call us when you arrive. - Yes, sure mom. Bye, Frida! - Bye. Bye, Frida. Bye, Frida! Bye, Frida! Bye! SUMMER 1993 How did it go? - Very well. Yes, your daughter is a sweetheart. Is she? You can leave her with me whenever. She hasn't complained? - No. Today at the party, everything okay? - Yes, all well. We had dinner at home... and then we went to the main square to dance. She danced with everybody. You know her. Did she sleep late? - Yes, we got here late. But she was tired. When we got here she fell asleep. I'm not surprised. How are you? Fine. Tired. Of course. Time to rest then. Go to sleep. Thanks a lot, Cesca. - Not at all. You need to be strong now. - Yes. Thanks. - It's nothing. Cesca, do you have the keys? - Yes. Good night. - Bye. Would you like a glass of milk and biscuits? Water? I'll get your pajamas from the car. Hey, it's me. Yes, we just got home. Yes. I was going to call now. Don't worry, mom. Right. We'll put her to bed now, yes. I'll give her a kiss for you. Right, good night. We'll call, yes. Good night. Could you get me that one? It's Frida, you see? Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? - Yes. Yes? Then sit down. Your breakfast is ready. Do you take sugar in your milk? - No. Drink your milk. Then if you want you can have a plum. Help with that one, please? This one? - Yes. Neus didn't like it either. You don't have to drink it if you don't want to. Esteve, she has to drink milk. Let's see if we get that one. Come down here. - I see three. I see three. That's it. We can't get that one. Did you drink two sips? - Yes. Very good. Would you like a plum? Esteve, turn it down! You'll go deaf! Did you eat some biscuits? I did. - I didn't. And two... And two more. Come on. You too, you too. Coward hens. Are you all scared? - Anna, be careful or you'll fall. Are you scared? Poor things. Gabriel! Gabriel, which sack do I get? Whatever you like. I don't need any. - Mom, I need to pee. Okay, I'll take the other one then. - I need to pee, Mom. Can we use your toilet? Sure. Coming! - Okay. There we go. You take this egg box, see? And you put the eggs in here. Like that. Okay. - Be careful. They break easily. Okay. Marga? Marga? Marga! Frida? - Frida! Frida! It'd be great if it rained. - Yes, it's been a while. Small pieces, please. It's burnt 10.000 hectares, they say. - 10.000? They had to evacuate two villages. - Lose the head. Apparently it was a cigarette. People pay no attention. Good morning! - Hello! Hello there! Hi, love. She's the girl of Esteve's sister, isn't she? Yes. - Poor little thing. I didn't know nowadays people could still die of pneumonia. Was it pneumonia? I thought it was something else. Cut me some loin, please. - She's my sister now. It's lucky you're such good people, Margarita. Do you still have patties? - Yes, of course. Would you like a little bit of ham, love? Okay. Our ham is really good. Here, you'll see. There we go, sweetheart. She's lovely. What do you say? - Thank you. How much is it? Let me see. This one is called Emerald. My mom gave it to me. This one is called Clory. From my grandparents. This one is Lucy. Lola gave it to me. And this one is Domino. You can't touch them because they're mine, and if you touch them they'll break. Promise? You know why I got so many dolls? Why? 'Cause they love me lots. They gave me presents, because they love me lots. And you cannot touch them. Promise? Promise. And this one is Nancy. She wears a T-shirt that... Again. I'll go. - Okay. Look, Feldespata is afraid. Hey, Feldespata! Are you okay? - Yes. It's all fine. When thunder comes, the bulbs explode, right? They don't explode. The light goes off, that's all. Are you having hiccups? Are you okay, Frida? Could lightning set fire to the house? No, it's impossible for the house to catch fire. Daddy is coming. Daddy's coming, right? He's here. Don't touch, Anna. This is burning. It's hot. You know that. Catalonia's firefighters have under control... the fire that started shortly before 4 pm... next to Santa Hortensia's graveyard. The most virulent moment was between 4:00 and 6:00 pm... when big extensions were burnt and some areas were not stabilized. Some army troops from Girona's barracks, together with the police... helped to evacuate the area and to secure the perimeter. Around 150 people had to be evacuated... from the area affected by the fire... Torre Gironella and Sant Daniel neighborhoods. The authorities are getting ready in case they need further assistance. Frida. I see you. Try not to scratch. You don't wanna tell me what's wrong? Is it because of the itching? Don't scratch it. If you don't tell me what's wrong, I can't help you. This bit of hair here doesn't look right. What bit of hair? This one. Can't you see it? That's easily fixed. See? Let me see. It's this bit, isn't it? Is that better? Is that better? Here, do it yourself if you want. Let's go. It's all right. We're close. We're almost done. You see. It was nothing. You're a brave girl. At the hospital in Barcelona, they told me they wouldn't do any more tests. Get dressed. They are done with you. Marga, sit down please. We need to run some more tests. What? In Barcelona they said she was fine. No issue. Considering her background, I just want to be certain. When will we get the results? Not sure. I'll call you as soon as they arrive. But... - Don't worry at all now... And for the eczema... this is a prescription for an antihistamine. Okay. She should take it once a day, all right? Tie your shoes. I don't know how. You do. Even Anna can tie her shoes. I don't know how. Mom, do you want to play with me? I'm really tired. I need to rest, sweetheart. My whole body is sore. Come on. Ask me again. Mommy, do you want to play with me? Be a good girl. Let me rest. Mommy, do you want to play with me? Darling, I love you so much, so very much, that I can never say 'No' to you. What should we play? You stay here, and I'll be the cook. I'll ask for things, and you bring them to me? Yes! - Okay. You know how to play. So pretty, Frida. Here you go. I've not ordered yet. - Okay. I want some chips... - Not yet! Here is the menu. Some chips... some olives... a bit of everything, a snack. Right, I'll prepare it just for you. Thanks a lot. There we go. Just on time. Do you like it? It's to die for! You know what, darling? I am really sore. We'll play more later, all right? In the name of The Father, Son and Holy Spirit, amen. Do you smoke? No. Where are you going? What are you doing? Nothing. And you? Where are you going? To my parents' room. It's a special present for my mom. She'll love it. When she comes, give it to her. Do you like Big-Heads? Has she been doing it for long? - No, only since last September. She's a little behind. She doesn't do it as well as the others, but she'll get there. Irene! Come and meet Frida. This is Irene. Very nice, Irene. I'll help you with the head. Can I play? Do you know about my mother? - Yes. My father died too. Frita's playing too! It's Frida. - You are it. Frida, are you all right? Irene! Don't touch it. Don't touch it! What did I say? - That's nothing. Did you touch it? Cesca, please. Everyone will hear you. You didn't touch her? - I told you. It's fine. You don't know for sure, Marga. - What's up? I told you. Don't touch her. What did I tell you? Blai, we're going too. Stay here, Anna. Don't come in. Frida, don't play with your blood. What happens if you put the hair dryer in the bath? Do you die? No, you don't die, but you can get electrocuted. It's dangerous. Let's see. All right. Blow. Done, cured. Go and wash your hands. Come on. That's it. I got wet. - Girls, bring me a lettuce. A lettuce? - Yes, from the garden. I'll get it. No, Anna. She asked me! Anna, let Frida go alone. She surely knows where it is! That's not a lettuce. This is a cabbage, Frida. Okay, I'll go back. Look, a ladybug. What are you doing, girl? I was doing that! I picked it. - No, I did! No, I did. - No. Yes. It's fine, Anna. Today Frida picked it. You'll do it another day. I did! Wash your hands. We're ready to eat. I'm so hungry! Hello, Daddy! - Hello! What a bundle of joy! Wash your hands, Anna. Leave me alone! Don't talk to your mom that way. I don't want to. - Yes, you do! Look, I'm going to dive into the water. I'll touch the bottom of the tub with my head, okay? One, two, three, now. Did you see? Who wants chips for dinner? Me! - Do you? And me! Come here. Let me finish my bath. Come on. No, I want to finish. - No, it's getting late. Anna, come on. Come on. Leave that. The soap wasn't here. You look so pretty. Put it on. Look, here. Rinse your hands. Good. Now put a hand in here. No, no, no! Put the soap in its place please, Frida. But I don't have one. You have one. You have a big one. There's a bar for each. I'm going to dive again. It feels good. Frida! Frida! Frida! Grandpa! Grandpa! Look who's here! Come to Grandpa! How are you doing? That's nice! How beautiful you are! - Come, come to Grandma. Look what I can do! You are thinner. Is she eating enough? Look what else I can do! How did you come? Look, Grandma! - Put that cigarette out. By bus. We wanted to surprise Frida. You two came by bus? - What else? Here's a nut! - By TEISA? We took the train... - Frida, come down. You'll fall. to Girona, and then the bus. Careful! Does Lola know you're here? - Grandpa! She wasn't home when we decided to come. I'll call and ask her to come and get you with Angie. It's fine. - Grandma! You really wanted to see us, didn't you, pet? I can climb that high! - Frida, enough. You'll fall. Grandpa, look what I can do! - This child is running wild. Come with Grandpa. Come here. Look what happened, Grandpa. What a shame. Frida, tie your shoe. You'll trip. Can you tie my shoe, Grandpa? - Of course. Grandpa's got you. Frida, you know how to do it. - Let's tie it. See how Grandpa ties the shoelace? Let's go. Come down here. As we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation. Lead us not into temptation. Deliver us from evil. Deliver us from evil. Amen. In the name of The Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. - Amen. You have to pray to your mother every night. She left us, but she's watching over you from Heaven. Your mother loved you so much. It was due to your father, God rest him, that she did a lot of silly things. But she loved you very much. What is this? It hurts, and I scratch it a lot. - Don't scratch yourself! Hello! - Lola! Mom, what are you doing here? - How are you, love? It's cooler here. Angie! - Hello, hello! Lola, look! I'm almost taller than you. - Really? What are you doing here? Let's eat. What should we do, Mom? - Let's eat. Dad! Come on, Dad! You've lost. You are not what you used to be, Dad. Without you, I lost practice. This antihistamine is clearly not working. Are you sure about this doctor? - Yes. We'll bring you medicine from Barcelona. Actually, Grandpa and I thought we could come on Sundays. You like us coming, don't you? - Yes. It's a long trip, but it's worthwhile. I don't know, Mom. We'd agreed to wait a bit for the visits. Yes, but it's time for us to have our turn... don't you think, son? Yes, of course. This is so hard. Lola is having an awful time... - Mom, don't bring me into this. I told you. This is what Neus said in her letter. It's a legal matter. Which letter? Which letter? - Sit down, darling. That daughter of mine was thoughtless. We all know she always made bad decisions. Shit, mom. You should all be ashamed. You too. You could have wound up the same way. Enough, Mom. - Maria, stop it. Who's living in my house now? It's ready to be rented, dear. Right now it's empty. Come on. Let's play again. Ready, Frida? Suddenly, something magical happened. Do you know what? What? All the men and women... developed gills, like fish. Do you know how fish breathe? No. Through their mouths? - Like this. No, like this. Like this? And thanks to their gills... they can go back to their homes and live under the water. What do you think? Good. Where is the island now? It's hidden. Nobody knows where it is. I can breathe underwater. Can you? Then you must be Atlantan. Let's dance! Follow the beat. Anna, tie your shoes. You'll trip. - No, you do it! No, come on. You know how to do it. No, I don't know. You do know. Don't give me that story. Just tie your shoes. - No. You see Frida, what you get with your nonsense? Come here. I'm going to sleep. Shall we dance alone? Forgive us our sins... as we forgive those who sin against us... and lead us not... into temptation... but deliver us from evil. Amen. In the name of The Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. Did you know... that we eat about eight kilos of flies and spiders while we sleep? Do you want to eat this one? Do you want to call your mom? Okay. Three, eight, nine, two, seven, six, eight. Frida! Frida! Shall we play? Frida! Do you wanna play with me? Frida? Frida! Frida! Frida? Frida! Do you wanna play with me? - No. Damn it! Do you wanna play with me now? Climb up here. Sit down. You hide here until I come back, okay? And when I come back... we'll go. Anna? Anna? Anna? Frida! Have you seen Anna? No. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Frida, when did you last see her? I think she was with you. Anna! Anna? Anna? Anna! Anna! Does it hurt? A little bit. Wash your hands. Did you hear me? They weren't playing. - She had no bad intentions. They're just kids. - They weren't playing. That girl has no morals. You weren't there. You don't know. You didn't see it! Lower your voice. - I'm being quiet. Do you realize what could have happened to Anna? What can we do? We need to set limits. She's been spoiled. She's always done whatever she wants. I understand what you're going through, but I need your support. Help me. You're right. Where did you get these flowers? It's a gift. Mommy, look what Frida did! You can't pick these flowers, Frida. They're from Gabriel's farm. What did Frida do to you? This was Frida. - Very nice. You left mud everywhere, Frida. You're a little mess. No, not yet. Do you know how many flies we eat while we sleep? No. How many? Kilos! Lots of kilos! Can I pay? - Sure! Lots of kilos! Just a coffee? - Yes. Dad, now? No. You need to wait twenty minutes. What if I get in slowly? Wait a little longer. Where is Marga? Mom isn't feeling well. What are you doing? Are you sick? No. But I've got my period and it hurts. What do you need this for? It warms me up. Are you sure you aren't sick? No. Go swim! One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight... nine, ten, eleven... What did you get to? Twelve. Anna, let's go to mom and dad's bed. I'm sleepy. Mom. Mom. Mom. What? What? Can we sleep with you? What's wrong? Anna's scared. Are you scared, my love? Come on, Frida. Come here. Jump in! Come here. Good night. - Good night. Good night, Daddy. - Good night. How come you're awake already? Good morning. Good morning! What happened? It wasn't me! - It wasn't? We took the mattress protector off a long time ago. It wasn't me. What's the matter with you? I don't feel well. I'm dizzy. I can't go to the doctor. Sure you can, Let's have breakfast. No! I don't want to! - Yes! You do! Come on! Just today, okay? Don't get used to it. Careful, it's dribbling everywhere. Mom, I won't get pricked with needles anymore? No. You've heard. You're only allergic to cats. You're very healthy, Frida. No more doctors. Good news, isn't it? Happy? Let me see. Let's see if you can touch the grass. Is it one of those two? Yes. Which one do you think is a spanner? Feldespata! Feldespata? This one. - Very good. Go then. You want a hand? - No. Look. You have to do it like this. Hold it firmly, like this. - Okay. Feldespata? That's one off. Frida, have you seen Feldespata? - No. Dad, I can't find my cat. I think she's gone on a trip. Where? - Around. Sweetheart, don't worry. She'll be fine, okay? Okay? - Okay. I'll go play, okay? - Yes. Stop! Stop! I'm getting in! Anna! Look what I can do! I can swim without standing. The water is so cold! Do I stand there? Yes. You dare? No! It's okay. it's okay. You're fine. You are fine. Are you okay? - Yes. Are you stupid or what? I told her not to. Do you want to kill Anna or what? Because that's what you'll do. You'll be all right. Don't cry. Mommy? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mommy? Get the rope, Gabriel. Hold it here. There we go. Okay. That's it. The last splash. - Virgin Mary. Hello, Frida. How are you? Yesterday I lost a tooth, did you know? Yes, I know. No, you don't. Yes, I know! Liar, liar, pants on fire! I'm not lying. You weren't there when I lost my tooth. Only Lola and Grandma were. This is our language. I don't feel like going out. I'm fine at home. Then no one sees me. Isn't that right? That's silly, Mom, but do whatever you want. You'll do that anyway. Did you drink your milk? Yes, I did. Who wants a present? Me! - Me! Pick a hand! This one! - This one! Here you go. What do you say? - Thank you. Thank you. I wanted a pink one, like Anna's. Frida, it's a present. It's nice. Come on. Pick up the nightdress. - No. Frida, pick up the nightdress. Mine is pink. - You shut up! Don't worry, love, when you come to Barcelona... we'll change it for a pink one. All right? Come on. Let's go get dressed. Come on. Suit yourself. It's all right, darling. No, it's not. Finish that milk and then go and wash that nightdress. Good morning. Good morning. Frida, don't give me that. Now drink your milk. - I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean to. Come on, Marga. Calm down. I'll wash the nightdress, and I can change it. It's not a problem. They make me do everything. Really? - They make me clean dishes. They make me clean the house. I'm like their housemaid. Come on, finish washing that. I'll help you. My house in Barcelona is still empty? It's still for rent. Very good. Okay, the stain is gone. Wring it out. Take care. - Please stay a little longer. Fix the path. It's dangerous for the girls. Sweetheart. - Grandma, please stay. We have to leave, darling. We'll see you soon. We'll come back very soon. They'll be back soon, Frida. Come on, don't be sad. Lola, can you stay? We'll come back soon, I promise. What are you doing? Oh, poor thing. Get out. Frida, get out of the car. They'll be back soon. No. Want to stay a few days with us? - There's room in the car. I don't know. What do you mean? She's to start school in a few days. We've got a lot to do. Maybe for a couple of days? Well... maybe she could go with them, and then I can pick her up. Yes, Daddy, please! Come on. - No, no! Frida, get out! - I don't want to! Your grandparents need to go. - No, I don't want to! Come on. Frida, please. Come on. Let's go. Get in, get in. Let's go. I can't bear this. What are you doing? - Let me go! No. - Let me go! Calm down. Calm down! Let me go! Let me go! Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me! Where are you going? I'm going back home. Why? Because no one loves me here. I love you. You can keep it. Thank you. - You're welcome. She can't have gone far. What if she doesn't know her way back? - Come on, Marga. She won't know how to get back. - Don't be a fear monger. Did you check up there? - I don't think she went into the woods. Maybe she broke her arm like I did. - Frida! Frida! - I'll check in the workshop. Frida! - Frida! Maybe she went to the main road. Fuck, don't scare me! She couldn't. Well, she's not around. Have a look in the car. - In the car, really? I don't know. I'm running out of ideas. Where are you going? - To the car! Frida! - Frida! Frida! I'll go tomorrow. It's too dark now. 'Feending' and then... They're called 'feengol, wellus, fingthen'. 'Feending'. What else? No. 'Feending, wellus, fingthen'. Very good. Look, cross off the ones we've already done. Language, Catalan language. Okay. And English language. Okay. And now I'll do the math book. Is it on the list? - Yes. Right. Oh, no. I messed up again. I hate this plastic. Okay, now. Okay. Perfect. That's it. Cross out the mathematics book. Better this way. How did my first mom die? Well, your mom died because she had a virus. Do you know what a virus is? - Yes. Like a tiny animal inside the body that killed all her defenses. The virus got stronger. Her body couldn't fight it, and she died. Was the doctor new? What do you mean? I wonder if he was new. Because he didn't know how to cure her? No, he wasn't new. He did everything he could. It was a very new virus. They didn't know much about it. They didn't know how... what to do. The doctors did their best. What else do you want to know? Did she bleed a lot? No. Really? She didn't bleed? No, she didn't. Most people who die don't bleed. Only if you have an accident and you get a wound. She didn't bleed. Were you there when she died? No. I arrived not long after. Who was there? Lola, Esteve... Angie, your aunts and uncles, everybody. Why was I not there if I'm her daughter? You were with your grandparents. And what did she say? She didn't say anything. She didn't say anything about me? No, she was sad, because she wanted to look after you. Did she tell you that? Yes. Look. You're not going to get sick, are you? - What? You're not going to get sick, are you? Now? No, I've no intention of getting sick. None. Can I decorate this? - Yes. What have you done here? A drawing? Yes. This one is Fidia, this one's Dobby, this one's Dunny... C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K... M, M, E, O, P, Q... R, S, T, X, Y, Z. A, B... Daddy, help me please. And put it there. - Here? Take this off. Tomorrow is first day of school! Grandma's nightdresses. This one is yours. Yes, this one is mine. And this one is mine. From your grandma! What grandma? - Yours! Really? Which one is yours? Mine? The same one? - The same one. Mine's the one I always had. How many grandmas do you have, 37? - No! We have the same grandma. Right. One moment. Let me see. Both of us have the same grandma. - Can you do it? Yes. - Yes? Very good. Me too. - How pretty! Put your head down. - It's the wrong way. Not like that. Frida, put your head down. - Wait. Okay. Okay. Done! What are you doing? - It's the wrong way around. Frida, don't jump. I'll help you. So you can learn. This one goes behind. - This bed is very noisy. You're going to break the bed, Frida. Okay, put your hand through here. - I like to jump. I know, but you'll break the bed. Frida. What are you doing? Done! Please don't jump! Don't jump. I am begging. Stop jumping. Stop jumping! Stop jumping! Stop! Can you hear me? Who do you think you are? The bed 'clonked'. - What are you doing? Be careful. What do we have here? It's a monkey attacking me! Hey, mate! - 'Hey, mate'? What do you mean by 'mate'? No more jumping! You go here, and you go there. - No! No! I've been good, you liar! Come here and I'll eat you! Hey, what's wrong? - What happened? What's wrong? Hey, what happened? - Frida. What's the matter? - I don't know. What's wrong? What happened? What happened, Frida? - I don't know. Did you hurt yourself? What's wrong? It's okay. What's wrong with you? What's wrong? What is it?
