[piano music playing] [piano music continues] [piano music playing] [inaudible weeping] [piano music playing] [clock ticking] [Annie] There you go. [Annie] Grandpa, can I get you anything? [Annie] You want your slip ons? [Annie] How about a... How about a glass of water? [Annie] I'll get you a glass of water. [Chris] I got some interesting mail here. [clock ticking] [Chris] Looks like there could be a couple of good coupons... [clock ticking] Vonnegut is on Charlie Rose tonight. [Eva] That man is a horse's ass! [instrumental music playing] [Eva] Vonnegut, eh? Yeah. [clock ticking] [Annie] Blue plate special. [Annie] A little cat nap? It's lunchtime. [Annie] Charlie G sent over some pastrami. There's like a gallon of it. [Max] What time is it? It's almost 1:30. Thank you. [flips pages] [closes book] [slams book] [man talking on television] [clicking noises] Are you planning on fixing that latch? [Eva laughing] Listen to this. [Eva continues laughing] "Once, I had a rose named after me, and I was very flattered. -"But, -[laughter continues] "I was not pleased to read, "the description in the catalog. "'No good in bed, but fine up against a wall.'" [both laughing] [laughter continues] [clock ticking] Hmm? Hey, I heard a good one the other day. "Cartoonist found dead in home. "Details are sketchy." "Details are sketchy." He's a cartoonist! [Annie] He makes sketches. It's like a pun. It's not very good. -You gotta get going. -Max? [Max] I want you to go. My shows are on. And you have to get back to your class. [Annie] Max, it's covered. It's fine. I want to be here with you. No. Now is... alone. -[Max] Please? -I'm staying. You're impossible! Where do you think I got it from? -From me! -Yeah, that's right. Please? Fine. [Annie] Fine. [stomps out] I'm coming back for Columbo . Fine. [door slams] [soft piano music playing] [clock ticking] [piano music continues] [instrumental music playing] [exhales] [Annie] I'll teach you how to use that can opener, okay. [exhales] [sniffles] [Annie] Here, Dad. I got this. [Chris] Mom always loved fresh flowers here, so I'll just... -[Chris] You got that? -[Annie] Uh-huh. [Chris] Okay. [jazz music playing] I, uh, brought some movies. I thought that might be a good thing. [Chris] I, uh, got comedies. I remembered you... Always loved comedies. This one... Is about a high school gym teacher... Who has big plans for the summer... but, is forced... to cancel them to teach an English class of misfit, goof-off students. [Chris] Fortunately, his unconventional brand of teaching begins to inspire them. I don't, uh... Well, there's two of them. [footsteps approaching] -You got them? -[Annie] Yeah. -Oh, those look nice. -[Annie] Mm-hmm. [Chris] Thank you. [Annie] Are you going to watch a movie? -Well, I was just suggesting... -[Max] We're fine, Chris. We're fine. Oh, I, uh... I thought, uh... we'd make a night of it. [Chris] Hang out, maybe? [Max] You can go. [Chris] All right. That's fine. I'm going to leave these... in case you, uh... [softly] Of course. There's no DVD player, huh? [Chris] All right. [footsteps] Uh, Pop, uh... I'm sorry. [opens door] [door shuts] [Eva laughing] [Eva] Dance with me, dummy. [laughter] [Eva laughs] [man on TV] Can't see the rest. Windows, windows, windows... It's ideal, this is a dream house. I'm glad you like it? [Annie] Paps. Grandpa. Hey? Max, let's go upstairs, huh? [Max] I'm fine right here, Annie. Max, it's time to go to sleep, okay? [Annie] Come on. [Max] I don't want to go upstairs. [Annie whispering] Okay, uh. [Annie] Stay down here. [piano music playing] [Chris] I was just remembering Mom's birthday, when I was quite young. I don't know how old, maybe five, six... You and I made her cookies, for her birthday. And then we forgot to turn the oven on. [Chris] And when we presented them, she still ate two. [Chris] That was Mom. Have you thought any more about something you might like to say? I think I'll do a little soft shoe. You can just express whatever you're feeling. Okay? [kisses] [kisses] [Max] Eva and I were married... Sixty five years. I can't even remember... my life without her. Everyone tells me... this is... going to get better... And easier. I know they believe that. But I can't see that happening. I'm 87 years old, and I've lost my Eva. The truth is... I've lost her a long time ago. [Max] For 65 years.. . her life with me... was a lie. I don't blame her. I blame myself. She thought... she married a different kind of man. A better man. But, she was... mistaken. I'm a failure. I failed my wife... [exhales] I... failed my family. I failed myself. [microphone feedback] You said something to... that... A few things today I found distressing. -Distressing? -[slams table] [Max] Do you know what distress is! My wife, the love of my life, is dead! [Chris] You're scaring us as... And you want me to sit here and converse with you! Okay. I want you to know that nobody thinks you're a failure. [Annie] You had a lovely marriage. You have a family that loves you. You made a beautiful record. Did something happen between you and Mom, that... you haven't told me, or anyone? No! Nothing! Absolutely nothing! When Kat's father died, her mom went to a bereavement counselor, "I'd like to make a phone call, to see if..." To make the phone call and see if they'll accept you! [Max] That's my answer to your brilliant suggestion. You're in pain. That's all I see... is someone in pain. [Chris] I'm just suggesting you talk to some... someone else. Someone outside the family. You can't talk to me, you won't talk to me. Is he talking to you about any of this? About the stuff that he said to a room full of strangers? Enough! [Annie] I got it, I got it. [door slams] [Max] Annie. [Max] I'd like to ask you something, but you have to be sure to tell me if I'm out of bounds. Why wasn't Scott here tonight? He's in Chicago. [distant dog barking] No. He, uh... He took a job with the philharmonic there. Why aren't you there? It's complicated. [Max] Come on, kid. Just go. [Max] Did you hear about... the restaurant... on the moon? They serve great food, but no atmosphere. Hoo-hoo. He, he, he. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? We could make Chicken Annie. No, I want you to go home... and get some sleep. [whispers] Okay. It still doesn't feel real. [inhales] Chicken Annie, tomorrow. I'm holding you to it, Buster. [kisses] [door opens] [Max] Goodbye, Annie. [door closes] [exhales] [water flowing] [Max] You know what I thought about? I was just lying there, listening to you breathe. And I never told you, Eva, but... You breathe nicer than anyone I've ever known in my life. And... I'm thinking to myself, "We've had 65 years together, but we never... figured how old we were... together. -[Max] Do you know how old? -[Eva] That's because my arithmetic is so... We're a hundred and sixty nine years old. Each? No, not each! -Both of us together. -Oh, really? A hundred and sixty-nine years old. It's a hell of a long time. -[Max] Yeah. -I wish we'd been together a hundred and sixty-nine years. [Eva] That would have been great. [clock ticks] [floor creaking] [clock ticking] [inhales] [floor creaks] [closes door] [clock ticks] Ahh. [suspenseful music] [closes drawer] [Max] I was cleaning your dresser... and the drawers... and, I came up with this. [Eva laughing] [Max] You're the secret in my heart. "Ben." There's a date on here. November 5th, 1959. I wracked my brain... trying to think of that day. [Eva] Remember your recording session in New York? [Max] November 5th, 1959. [Eva] You've got a flight to catch. [Max] And you said... [Eva] Hurry home. [Max] Until I join you. [door opens] [Annie] So... this is... Captopril. [Annie] That is for blood pressure, and you take that once a day in the morning, with food. [Annie] And, this is the new one. What is that for? [Annie] It's for... when you get agitated. -[Annie] Max? -Yes. [Annie] Why did you say that stuff yesterday? [Max] Can I have the pill? Thank you. Will you talk to me, please? [Annie] What's going on? [sighs] [Annie] Oh, her compact. I always loved this. [taps table] Open it up. [clicks] What is that? She never let me play with it. [Annie] I thought you gave it to her. Uh. There are a thousand explanations for this, so, whatever you're thinking, I'm sure you're wrong. [Annie] I'm staying tonight. Let's make some dinner, okay? [Max] Yeah. [Max] Good. [Annie] Are you sitting where I said? Yes I am, honey. [Annie] Close your eyes. Uh, my eyes are on the floor. [Annie] Keep them closed. [Annie] Okay, you can open them now! [Annie] Are you ready? [piano music playing] [thumping on floor] Stairs... and... escalator. -[Max] Oh, God! -[laughing and clapping] [Annie] Okay. And now... I have a couple of jokes for you. Um, I asked my 5th graders at school, [Annie] uh, to tell me their favorite jokes. What does a fish say when it runs into a wall? "Dam!" [Annie] Uh, um... Um... Let's try, uh... What do you get when you cross a vampire and a snowman? Frostbite. [Annie laughing] [Annie] Can we have a little... Thank you! Thank you. [laughs] -[Max] Let me give you a little sugar. -[Annie] Mwah. I'm so proud of you. You were so good. [Annie laughing] You look like a skinny, Roseanne Barr. [Annie laughing] [Annie] I don't know if that's a compliment.

[instrumental music playing] [Max] You here here with him that day. He was here. [Eva] You're still worried about that? [Eva] So you're doing housekeeping now? [Eva] Why don't you worry about what happened in New York. [Eva] What happened in the recording session, Max? [Max] I played awful. [Max] My performance was... [Max] Indescribable. [instrumental music continues] [Max] There's a date, November 5th, 1959. [instrumental music playing] [Max] We had a good life, didn't we? [Eva] What are you looking for, for God's sake? [Eva] You think you're going to find a picture of him? [Eva] You were always preoccupied with success. Or should I say, failure. Poor Max. [Eva] Better keep looking.

[phone rings] -[Max] Hello? -[woman] Hello. -[Max] Annie? -[Annie] Grandpa, I've been calling for hours. [Max] Your grandmother... [Max] She was just here. [slams phone] [Annie] Grandpa, can you hear me? [Annie] Are you sure you're okay? [Max] For 65 years I was loyal and true. [Max] And I never once ever looked at another woman. [Max] You were my wife. My girl. [Max] But I do have to know, why? [slams door] [Max groans] [heart beats] [Max groaning] [thuds] [piano music playing] [wind chime tinkling] Ahh. Ah. [Max] Annie? [Annie] Hey, sunshine. [Annie] Dad brought that. [Annie] He left it. He didn't want to wake you. [Annie] And I brought your red sweater. And, your gray slacks... were in the kitchen trash. [Annie] So I'm having them cleaned. For what? [Annie] Why am I having them cleaned? Because they were in the kitchen trash. And, look... It's a new scarf. Well, what's the matter with my old scarf? Nothing. I just... Grandma was knitting this for you, and so I finished it. I gotta go home. You said you'd give this a try. I did. I gave it a try. One night's not enough. Well... somebody... has got to keep an eye on the kitchen sink. -It's got some leak. -[Annie] I'll do it. What do you mean you'll do it? Yeah, don't worry about it. You don't know how to do that. I'll get a plumber to do it. Oh, sure. Spend a lot money. That's terrific! [Max] God! I gotta go home. [Annie] Max, please. [Annie] Please don't do this. [exhales] I saw the picture.

[Ms. Flowers laughing] Well, uh, I wanted to ask you here because, uh, I thought it was really important for you to have some, uh... social interaction with... with your peers. And I was wondering if you had a chance to look at some of the fantastic activities that we have here. Activities? [Ms. Flowers] Well, we've got some, uh, great activities like cooking class. Do you like to cook? [Ms. Flowers] Um... Book club? There is, uh, what about, uh, working out? Do you like to work out? It's very good to exercise at your age, Mr. Rose. You know, I read in your file that you're a musician. Yes, some time ago. Yeah. [Ms. Flowers] Mm-hmm. Well, we've got this performance series every Wednesday... where I could really use... your talent. Maybe you could... consult? Listen, if you think a cooking class is stupid... [Ms. Flowers] You know, that's fine. You don't have to cook. I'm just trying to help you. I'm here to try to help you find a little bit of happiness. [Ms. Flowers] Does that make sense? [Ms. Flowers] If you want to sit in your room all day long, and stare out the window and feel sorry for yourself, you can be my guest. But I'm here to help you. If there's anything that you want to talk about, I know there's a lot of adjustments going on right now, so... Please come talk to me, okay. I would like that. You live here now. And I believe that a whole new world could be opened up to you. But I'm gonna need you to participate.

You got something of a minor celebrity at this table, Max. Walter is the oldest man in California. [Walter] Hey you, you gotta keep... the mind, and the body in motion. [Walter] You, uh, think you're young... you be young. [clicks tongue] You got a parrot? I had the parrot. And the parrot was... okay. [Lee] Sometimes he would really... talk too much out of turn, you know. "Polly want a cracker!" "Polly want a..." Shut up! [laughter] You're, you're, you're in a rare form today. Yeah. Well, you know... Look at all these nice ladies in here, man. [Walter] Jack, you've been married five times? [Jack] Yeah. Could you pick out one... that was really the best. Or that you wish you had stayed with. Yeah, all five of them. I don't even remember. They're divorcing me faster than I can marry them. [Lee] Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. [Lee] How long you say you were married? Fifty-two years. [Walter] She's been gone... around 27 years. [Lee] You still kind of miss her, huh? Oh, yeah. -Really? -Oh, every... After 27 years? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I... Every, uh... Every, every, every, every, uh... night. I, I, you know, I still send her a kiss. [Lee] Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Yeah. [Walter] She, she, she was a... [Walter] A great woman. [instrumental music playing] [Chris] Uh, I actually looked up this pizza place. Uh, they have reviews... And, um... Four out of five, uh, for a pizza place is remarkable... if not historical. [Chris] Uh, I'd never heard of the place, so we, um... we went in there... and, uh... and I thought it was good. -[Chris] Yeah. -[Annie] It was okay. I don't know if I'd give it four out of five, per se. See what I made. Oh, wow! Pot holders. In the shape of a body part. These are kidneys. [Chris] Thank you. These are great. How's it going in here? Okay. [Annie] So, Max, Dad talked to the real estate agent. And she said the offer from the Kay's is the best we can expect. Then we don't sell the house. [Annie] I know. But... the thing is... you need the money, to cover the cost of living here. Look, I took the offer. You took the offer? It's like Annie said. This... This place is very, very, expensive. The house... wonderful memories and a great life... that... that we all had there at some point, and... [gulping] You have to sell in order to stay here. [Max] It's not your house... to sell! You put my name on the deed. That was a convenience. I did what had to be done. [Max] You selfish little putz! [Chris] Okay... Great to see you, as always. [Max] Who'd you sell it to? One of your big shot friends? [Max] No, maybe you bought it for yourself, so you could go and get another wife, and a bunch of kids that you don't take care of. I take care of my kids. [Max] Like you cared for, Annie? I, I care about you, Pop. I don't want to fight. I don't need you to care for me. [Chris] Okay, look... we, we got to, uh, deal with this. Deal with what? I'm not angry at you, Pop. I love you. [Chris] Okay? I love you. You try to say it? I love you. [smacks lips] [Chris] Please. [Max] I've seen what you do to people you love. Okay. All right. You win. Escrow will close Monday. The money is in a trust. [opens door] [door closes] [exhales sharply] How's Scott? Scott's fine. Anything new? Maybe, about Chicago? You know, I've got my kids and my class here, so... Do you know... If they could package how I feel about you... [both] ...they'd make millions of dollars. Max, you're too mean to my dad. You don't have to defend your father, Annie. I know. I don't have to. He wants to be close to you and you won't let him. Annie, I'm just a little bit older than you, but, I think I know my own son. No! No. I don't think you do. He has a lot to handle right now between me, and you, and everything that's going on with, Kat. He's being a good father to me. He is. Even if you won't see it. And he tries to be a good son. You're a different person with him, Max, and it isn't fair. I know exactly what you're doing. You're staying here... because of me. But I'm fine, Annie. I am. I'm sleeping better. I keep busy. And all that stuff you... you said at the funeral was right on. You were absolutely right. And grandpa is okay. [exhales] I found it in one of her books last week. [Annie] I debated about a thousand ways whether I should give it to you. [Annie] It's from him. [clicks] [knocks on door] [Lee] Come on in this house too! Don't you know it's rattlesnakes out there? [Max laughing] [Jack] The piano man is here. [jazz music playing] [Lee] Yeah! -Hit me. -Hit him. [Lee] Somebody, hit me. [Walter] Come on, Jack? -[Jack] Hit him again. -[Walter] Yeah. [laughter] [jazz music playing] [inaudible dialog] [Max] And when I get out of the shower and I look at this, head to toe... And I realize... I've been using all this stuff for more than 80 years. No wonder it's breaking down. [Jack] You're not indestructible... and that's a disappointment. Sixty. Sixty five, seventy. Seventy five, eighty. Eighty five... [coughs] Ninety. We would go around New York, closing up all the jazz joints, listening to everybody, man. 'Cause music in the 60s was everywhere. [Jack] There use to be a show business Jewish temple. Producer goes in there... And as he looks around the temple, there's a dog in there. [Jack] When the rabbi leads the prayer... the dogs puts his hands up and he's... davining, and the producer says, "I can make a fortune if I can get that dog in a movie." And he goes to the owner of the dog, he says, How does a dog learn to davin? He says, -"The dog is Jewish..." -[Max] Okay. so he says, uh... Producer says, "I'd like to get the rights to use that dog." And the owner of the dog says, "That's a very tempting offer, but the dog has his mind set on becoming a dentist."

[Lee] Don't you recognize me? I had my own series. For fifteen years... Everybody knew me on the street. [Lee] People came up with their babies and kids, wanted my autograph. You can't buy that, Max. That's a gift. You know, and I've been very, very, fortunate. [Lee] Hey, dude, what's your story, man? You can tell me. I'm your friend. Is it bad? [Lee] Well... If by bad you mean the worst possible scenario... Then, yes. "Eva, it's all settled. I will arrive on the 5th, after Max departs for his recording session in New York, I eagerly await an audience with your latest pieces. And, as always, with you." [instrumental music playing] [Lee] Let me see this. [Lee] B.S. Tracey? [Lee] I know this dude. [Max] You know him? I mean, I don't know him, but, yeah, I know him. [Lee] Big producer. [Lee] He loved putting his name on things. You know what I'm saying? [Lee] You know a B.S. Tracey productions? [Lee] Huh. [Lee] Hey, Billy. It's me, Lee. Miller. What's up, man?

[car approaching] [Lee] What is this? An old flame? [Max] I got something I gotta do. [kids] Grandpa, grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa, Max. [Lucy] Grandpa, Max. Grandpa, Max! [Max] Hi, sweetheart. Hi, darling. How are you two? You both getting ready for bedtime? [kids] Yeah. [Max] Yeah, that'd be nice. I wish I could go with you, 'cause I'm so sleepy now. -[Chris] You want to play with your grandpa? -[kids] Yeah! [Chris] Get in there. Is that the way you like it? -[Lucy] Yeah, and then put that on. -[girl] Put the hat on. [Max] No, I will not wear a hat. -[kids] Why? -[Max] Cause I'll muss my hair. -[kids] No, you won't. -[Max] And I combed my hair this morning -for over 35 minutes. -[kids] We won't muss your hair. [kids] You won't mess your hair up. [girl] Wait, put them on his head. [Lucy] I'll wear the nose and the hat. -[Max] You cant have the nose. -[girl] Why? -[Max] 'Cause it's my nose. -[girl] It's not your nose. -[Max] You want to put it on? -Yeah. [Max] Let's see if I... Put your hand out. Let me see if I can fit it on your nose. [kid] Can it fit? Lucy, you don't have enough nose. [Chris] You have a preference in tea? [Max] Breakfast tea. [Chris] Uh-huh. [Chris] Breakfast tea. They're great kids, Chris. I know. Are you doing okay? I don't know. My marriage is falling apart. My mom just died. My dad thinks I'm a waste of space. I'm great! I don't think you're a waste. No? Then why is it that's one of the nicest things you've ever said to me? You know how you think back... to when you were younger and you had wonderful dreams. [Max] Everything was so beautiful, and pretty, and nice... and loving. Those things just don't go away. We're guilty of pushing them away. I'm still a little groggy. Is that an apology? Don't push it, Chris. You had your music. You had Mom. You guys somehow loved each other day in, day out, for 65 years. I'm two marriages in, I still can't figure it out. Sometime you have to act... the way you feel. The way you really feel. That'd be nice. Got anything in mind? [piano music playing] [Chris] That's some house. [Max] Yeah, it is. [Chris] Hey, pop... here's the button over here. [Max] Oh, okay. [beeps] [woman] Hello? [Max] I'm here for Ben Tracey. [gate opens] [Chris] I'll wait for you out here, Pop. [opens latch] Eva Rose sent me. [opening door] [door opens] [closes door] He's in there. Good luck. [clock ticking] [clock chiming] [Ben] I was so close. So close. I almost made it underground... without seeing your face. [Ben] Uh. Come here. [labored breathing] Come on over here. Come here! There you go, you can do it. [footsteps ] Come on, have a seat. Do you play the piano? [Ben laughs] No, just sit down. Come on, come, on, come on. Sit down, sit down, sit down. [Ben] Oh, God. I got cigarettes there, can you get me one? Ahh. [Ben] Oh, yeah. Okay, good. Yeah. How about a light? I know it's asking a lot. [strikes lighter] [Ben groaning] [Ben exhales] Eva... Lillian Rose. [Ben] She's survived by her son, Christopher, her grandchildren, and of course... ahh... by her beloved husband of 65 years, Max Rose. Hmm. You don't know how disappointed I am. I was hoping you would go first. [Ben groans] [Ben] Ahh! Uh. [clicks] [Ben] So... What do you know about me? You're my wife's lover! [Ben laughs] [coughing] [Ben] Uh, listen... [water flowing] I, uh, I bought your wife's drawings, so it's strictly a professional relationship, okay? I don't believe you. Huh, well, you shouldn't. It's a lie. I want the truth! [Ben laughing] Max Rose wants the truth! Everybody get that? [coughs] Well... [Ben] Let me make you a drink. [Ben] Okay. [Ben] Ahh! Here you go. Now, that's the finest chair in my house, the most comfortable, I hope you like it, because it's throne-like, and that befits you. [Ben] You know what I'm saying? Um, um, oh... Here's... to dying. [Ben] We all start out with a slap on the ass, and then we end up... jealous old men, wishing we had what the other guy's got. [chuckles] [Ben] Yeah. Ahh! [Ben] But... [exhales] it's what we do in the middle. And I got mine. Hollywood, big time. [Ben] Even my old man was impressed. That bastard! [Max] Ben. Did you have a relationship with Eva? Yes, no. What do you think? November the 5th, 1959. You crazy son of a bitch! You come onto my doorstep and ask me about one thing that happened 50 years ago! [chuckling] [Max] And what happened that day? [exhales] I don't remember. [Max] I think you do. [switch clicks] November 5th, 1959. Where did you get that? [clicks open] [Ben sobbing] She... Oh, she kept it... She kept it. [sobbing] [coughing] [Ben] Could you... [Ben] Could you get my pills out on the table there? [Ben coughing] [clears throat] [labored breathing] Life goes on, huh? [chuckles] [labored breathing] [sniffling] I met, Eva... at USC. [exhales] I knew right away. [Ben] This woman... she was something more. This woman gave with her whole heart. Then, uh... she met you. That, uh, you were playing at some club or another. And she was so smitten with you. [exhales] [Ban] Who are you? Some cliche, some passionate artist? I, I could have made you myself. But she thought she was in love. And then she made... the crazy decision to marry you. [sniffs] But I had to keep her in my life, so... I bought her drawings. As I told her. She was some kind of a Picasso. [Ben] It was just an excuse. But, she didn't care. But I finally started to get to her. Yeah, November 5th, 1959. [Ben] You went to New York, and... And I went all in. "Leave with me. Let me take care of you. Let me rent you a studio, and you could be a real artist." [Max] So what happened? What happened? [Ben sobs] What do you think happened? She wouldn't leave you, you putz. [coughs] So... I gave her this... as a little reminder... [exhales] so she'd know she always had a choice. [Ben] And she kept it. [whispers] She kept it. [Ben coughing] [coughing continues] [Ben] Oh, God. I'm tired. Ah. Ah. [Max] Come on, Ben. Let me help you. [Ben] Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. [Ben] Ahh. [labored breathing] She was a hell of a girl, wasn't she? Yes, she was. [piano music playing] [Chris] You sure you don't want me to wait? [Max] No. Thank you. So what is this? That's the greatest Italian restaurant you've ever been to in your life. [Max] And I had this hankering... for their chicken cacciatore. I love chicken cacciatore. Yeah. Me too. Look, I'll catch a cab. -I'll be fine. -Okay. Are we gonna be all right, kid? Salt and pepper. Bread and butter. Your kids need you, Chris. [Max] They really do. [Chris] Thanks. You sure you don't want me to wait? I don't mind. -No, I'll catch a cab. I'll be fine. -Okay. All right. [Max] I've caught cabs before, and I was fine. -Get out of the car. -I'm still fine... -Get out of the car. -[Max] What? Get out of the car. -[Max] get out of the car? -Yeah. Oh, okay. [laughing] [phone ringing] [phone vibrating] -[Annie] Hello? -[Max] Hello, Annie. -It's, Max. -[Annie] Max? [Annie] Is... Is everything okay? Everything's perfect. [Annie] What do you mean? [switch clicks] [Annie] Where are you? [Max] I want you to make me your best promise, Annie. Are you out somewhere? [Max] Promise me, honey. What? I want you to go to Chicago to be with Scott. [Max] Annie, you're a wonderful person. So much love to give. Sharing that love... That's the most important thing. [Max] More important than work. More important than dreams. It's more important than anything. [Max] Do you understand, Honey? I understand. [Max] I love you, baby. And I always will. You're going to have a beautiful life, honey. [sobbing] No... I love you. I love you too. Goodbye, cookie-face. Goodbye, Gramps.
