- [two-wheeler revving] - [vehicles honking] [woman] It was a name that sounded so sweet, so seductive. Synonymous with wealth... style... power. You passed one of their windows and peeked inside, hoping you'd earn enough money someday to afford the second-cheapest item. Surprise! You won't. But the last name was a curse too. It belonged to a Tuscan family. They didn't fight over land or crown. - Morning! - [speaks Italian] [woman] They fought over their own skins. [man] Signor Gucci? ["La Ragazza Col Maglione" playing] [man 1 wolf-whistles] [man 2 shouting in Italian] [man 3 laughs] [man 4 shouting in Italian] [men shouting in Italian] [man laughs] Hey! Back to work. Come on. Hey! Come on. [speaks Italian] [man 1 speaks Italian] [man 2 wolf-whistles] [man 3 speaking Italian] - [man 4 wolf-whistles] - [man 5 speaking Italian] [dog barking] [telephone ringing] [man] Perfect! It's just like mine. Fernando Reggiani. [speaks Italian] Good girl. - Hey, Fernando. - Hey. Your lunches are getting expensive. Because I have expensive taste, huh? [chuckles] Don't tell Ma. She'll kill you. - [telephone ringing] - You don't tell your mother. [chuckles] Hello. Max! Darling. Tonight? I think I'm free. [disco music playing] [indistinct conversations] Do you like it? Yeah? This is fun! [people cheering] No, no. Tanqueray martini with a twist. I don't work here. Then why are you behind the bar? [man chuckles] Is this part of your costume? I, uh... I didn't know it was a costume party. The... The bartender... [mutters] Yeah, I... I'll make you a drink. Thank you. Who invited you? Bianca. I don't know her. Bianca Sarzana. It's her party. Oh. [laughs] Right. That Bianca. [chuckles] I'm Patrizia. Patrizia... Maurizio Gucci. It's a pleasure to meet you, Patrizia. It's a pleasure to meet you! You too. Patrizia, how come I've never seen you before? You weren't looking hard enough. I would have noticed that Bianca was friends with Elizabeth Taylor. I can assure you... I'm way more fun. It's good. Wanna dance? No. That's good. Come on. [soulful music playing] Is my dancing that bad? No, no, no. No. I have to go. It's only midnight, Cinderella. The night is young. I turn into a frog at midnight. It's nice to meet you, Patrizia. It's a pumpkin. Not a frog. Hello. Hello. I'm sorry, have we met? Elizabeth Taylor. - Patrizia Reggiani. - Yes, of course. Patrizia Reggiani. It's good to see you again. You too. Do you study here? I'm considering it. The problem is I hate reading. I get bored. Oh. What are those about? These are... Well, these are very exciting books about the legislative process. I'm studying to be a lawyer. You seem too nice to be a lawyer. [chuckles] Well, there are a few good ones. - The dead ones. - [laughs] [engine turns over] What were the chances of us seeing each other again? It's fate. It was a really nice surprise. [chuckles] Aren't you going to ask me out? You... You wanna go on a date with me? Of course, I would... I want to see how this story goes. Yes... [chuckles] That's my number. I'm very busy, but I'll make time for you... Maurizio. - Ciao. - Ciao. [telephone ringing] [music playing on headphones] It's for you. Hello? [sighs] So do you think you're gonna pass the bar soon? I think I have a... Would you like to go into this place? Oh, no. I can't eat there. It's too expensive. Okay. Okay, I can try. Would you like to go in? [Patrizia chuckles] No? Okay. Ah! This is for you. It looks so good. Thank you. That's all right. Can I have a napkin? Can I have a bite? Mmm. So good. Here. Mm. [Patrizia chuckles] Oh, that's very good. Come on. Okay. [Patrizia laughing] - [Patrizia] Sit. - Oh, no. Get up. What are you doing? Are you okay? [Maurizio] I fell back. Oh... It's fine. [Patrizia chuckles] Father, I would like to introduce you to Patrizia Reggiani. Patrizia, this is my father, Rodolfo. Delighted to meet you. I trust Adele has been keeping you amused. Picasso? No. No, no. No, it's Klimt. How silly of me. Oh, no, no, no. It's an easy mistake. I've made worse myself. Must be worth a fortune. [all laughing] Yes. But you know, to me, art, like beauty, has no price. I made a reservation for us at the Gallia. Perfect choice. [indistinct chatter] [Rodolfo] So Patrizia... What... What exactly are your interests? I'm a very social person. Are you? - A people pleaser. - Oh. And, do you study? I work for my father's business. [Rodolfo] Ah. And his business is? Ground transportation. Oh. Maurizio said you used to be an actor. Yes, I was. You may remember a film, The Ancestor? No, no, no. Of course. You're too young. But sometimes on the TV, they play a movie Tourist Train. - Tourist Train sounds familiar. - Yeah, well... Maybe you noticed a dashing young actor, Maurizio D'Ancora. That would have been me. I didn't know I was sitting with a movie star. Can I get an autograph? [Rodolfo] Oh, no, no, no. The only good thing that came from my career was meeting Maurizio's mother. Now she, she was a star. I remember at her funeral... during a moment of silent remembrance, Maurizio noticed the priest lighting candles... and he began to sing "Happy Birthday." He turned, maybe the saddest moment of my life, into something... How do you say, something sweet. That's my son. That is my dear boy. - Grazie, Franco. - Thank you, sir. Ah, Maurizio. I liked your Patrizia. Charming. Father, she really liked you. Tell me, where did you meet her? I met her at a party. [Rodolfo] Party? Yeah, Luca Sarzana's house. At the Palazzo Serbelloni. [Rodolfo] Yes, I know where the Sarzanas live. You know... there is a certain sort of young woman... who makes their fortune from getting their hooks into someone like you. Well, yes, Father, but Patrizia is not like that. [Rodolfo] Well, I had Franco do a little investigation. I think she's after your money. Like they all are. The Reggianis... are truck drivers. Her father has a very successful transportation business. It is... It is an empire. Oh! A truck driving empire. How many? - How many what? - How many trucks? Fifty? Five hundred? What does he transport, garbage? Huh? Mafia! [coughing] Oh... Listen, I've... I give you everything. I give you this house, I give you money. You have a life. You... What is it you want? What I want is to marry her. Live with her. Fuck her. Have a good time with her. Do what you want. Go away on holiday. Go to Sardinia. But, no, not marry. No, don't walk away. Okay, listen to yourself. You're so bitter and you don't even realize it. Who cares what her family name is, or how many trucks they have. You hide here in the past and you expect me to hide here with you? Not anymore! These are your ghosts. These are your ghosts, not mine. These are your regrets. Don't do this to me. You can't stop it. I can, I will. I will... I cut you from my will. I'll leave you with nothing. That's fine. I love her. [Rodolfo] You're making a big mistake. Oh, she's fine, but, you know, she's a... She's just a... I love what she is. [doorbell rings] Si? Commendatore Reggiani, my name is Maurizio Gucci. - [woman] Patrizia! - [Patrizia] Uh-huh? [woman speaks in other lanugage] I have had a disagreement with my father that has forced me to leave my home and my family business. I am still in school. I'm studying to be a lawyer, so as of this moment I do not have a job, but I... [speaks Italian] But I'm in love with your daughter. And I would like to marry her. Although, now I have nothing to offer her. I, uh... I need a job. Mom. Mama. ["Sono Bugiarda" playing] [chuckles] [laughing] [all cheering] [over P.A.] Maurizio Gucci, you're urgently needed in accounting. [man] Maurizio! Maurizio!

[speaks Japanese] [both chuckling] [Rodolfo] What's all this Japanese bullshit? I'm learning. You know, they're our best customers, so. They're loyal, they're quiet. And they're rich. One of your terrible ideas. Here it is. Gotemba. Gotemba? Yeah, near the foot of Mount Fuji. It's a mall. Ninety minutes by bus from Tokyo. It will be built in the spring. A window into the Asian market. - No, no, no. - It's a stepping stone. - No, no, no. - Come on! No, Aldo. You and your profits. Come on, things are fine as they are. Gucci doesn't belong in a mall, it belongs in a museum. Museum where it'll make no profit. What's this? No. Aldo, as long as we are fifty-fifty, that's how it stays. No malls.

I'm telling you... you'll only wind up being a bitter and lonely old man. That's what happens to all of us. Time will tell. But... Yeah. When did you last touch him, huh? When did you last hug him? You don't touch anybody. You used to touch every once in a while, now you, what, touch yourself? - You? You, teaching me? - That's correct. [stuttering] How's it going with your boy? Hmm? Well, your son is a smart lawyer. Mine is an idiot. But he's my idiot. And I know how to deal with him. But you need to deal with your son. - Ah... - Yes. It's my birthday on Sunday. Yeah? We'll all be there. You should come. I'll have to look at my diary. [telephone ringing] - Hello. - [Aldo] Hello. Who is this? - Si, this is Aldo. Aldo Gucci. - Aldo. I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. What could be more important than a phone call from my new uncle? I am truly sorry for not being able to come to your wedding. It was... I couldn't help it. Business beckoned. Easy on that. I understand, of course. I know how busy you are. We are celebrating my birthday this weekend at my villa. And I think it would be a perfect opportunity for you to come and meet the family. What do you think? Your birthday, I would love that. How many candles is it? Seventy. They say it's the new sixty-nine. Well, I can't speak for Maurizio. He's right here. [whispers] No. Please. Ciao, Aldo. Maurizio! How is my little lawyer? I'm fine. I'm fine. What are you doing this Sunday? I'll double check. Come to my birthday party. I'm only in town for a couple of weeks. Come on. Let me discuss it with Patrizia. - Let's go! A little day trip. - I don't... You know, your father and I aren't getting any younger. These gatherings are becoming more and more of a rare occurrence, you know. Please. Come on! I'll be jumping out of a cake. [operatic music playing] [men grunting] Come on. Kick his teeth out. Come on! Come on! Earn your fucking lunch! Kick his teeth out. Come on! Go, go, go! That's it. Go! Maurizio! Come on! We're missing a player. - Oh. No, no, no. - What no? Yes, yes. Come on. We're missing a player. Come on! - Put it on. Take that jacket off. - Okay. You know it. Paolo! Watch him. Watch him play. See that? Oh, my God. Look at that. [man] Maurizio! Maurizio! [shouts] [Aldo] That's your husband! [groans] Paolo! Papa... - ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Oh, no. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ How do you act shy? ♪ Happy birthday, dear Aldo ♪ - Papa! - "Papa." I love that. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ He's never in his life called me Papa. Patrizia, you should know... that the Guccis were noble saddle-makers to medieval courts. We have history flowing through these green and red webbings. And yes, we are expensive. But quality is remembered long after price is forgotten. Huh? Thoughts on Paolo's outfit, Domenico? You're the fashionista. It's eccentric. I designed this myself. Well, you should reconsider your wardrobe choices, Paolo. You are Gucci, you need to dress the part. It's chic. My father's problem is that he's stuck in the past. He refuses to take Gucci into the next century. - [Aldo] Yes, Gucci is doing fine under my watch. - [Paolo] No! - No, don't worry about it. - Oh, no! No. No. It needs new ideas. - New energy. - Of course. And I happen to be bursting with creativity. - Yes, yes. - Yes, my bladder may be full... but my dreams are even fuller. I'm like a rush of water. Somebody build a dam. Please. [Paolo] You're always brushing me off. I'm a designer. I need to express myself. - But why all this sudden moaning? - I have a... - [Aldo] What do you want? - [Paolo] Because, I'm so sick of you ignoring me. I am sick of your talking. Sick of it. You deliberately hurt my feelings. - [Aldo] Yes. - No, no, no. - Jenny! Jenny honey. - No! That's what he wants. - Don't. Sit down. Sit down! Sit down. - [Aldo] You have succeeded. I haven't had espresso. - [Aldo] Bye. - Thanks for having us, Uncle. Ah! My nephew, he has such great taste. Oh. A small wedding gift. Thank you. Come to New York. Okay? - Ciao, Aldo. - Ciao! - Ciao. - [laughs] [bidding farewell in Italian] Oh, it's good to see you. I couldn't believe you got into the car. How did you do that? [Maurizio] It's all bullshit. We're not royalty. My grandfather Guccio was a bellhop in London. That's where he got the idea for leather goods. By carrying bags around for rich aristocrats. Gucci is like that cake. What? Once you think there's enough to go around... then you'll have a taste, and then you'll want more... and then you'll want the whole thing for yourself. What about you? You just gonna sit around and watch them eat everything? Me? I am Gucci by name. I don't have their Tuscan character. It was diluted by my mother's German blood. The only wedding gift the Guccis gave us. Coupons. Feels like cash. I doubt it. It's not cash. Fucking Concorde. To where? New York. New York. Ah, Patrizia. We can't drive to New York, we have to fly. You wanna go to New York? No. Everybody likes New York. I don't. I wanna go to New York. [gasps] New York. I love New York. What are you doing? [Patrizia] New York. Okay. Okay. [switching Italian channels] [woman in English] Do you have medical maladies, financial woes... heartbreak? I can help you with everything and anything. And it's very, very private. Because Pina is discreet. And very accurate. You can come to me with any worries. There is no need to suffer. [telephone ringing] Hello, who am I speaking to? - Patrizia. - [dialogue echoing on TV] How old are you, dear? Twenty-five. Twenty-five. What is your question, Patrizia? Will I be successful? You have to be more specific. In what? Career, marriage, what? Will I get what I want? That was not specific. But I know what you want. You want everything. Well, don't be disappointed if you don't hear what you want to hear. Okay. What's your name? My name is Pina. Hello, Pina. Tell me everything. I see a great fortune... coming your way. How big? - Sophia! Sophia! - Sophia! [pop music playing] [reporters clamoring] [reporters clamoring] Maybe, I'm not sure. Yes, we have something. I can show you. Mademoiselle. All due respect, these heels are not right for you. Hello, Uncle. No! What are you doing? Patrizia. - Oh, my! - [greets in Italian] My gorgeous niece. Patrizia. I was just in the neighborhood. - Yes? In the neighborhood? - I was hoping I'd see you. Maurizio is a very smart young man. So how are things with his father? Not bad, not good. Yeah. My brother, he's a difficult man. But it's time for them to reconcile. Maurizio and his father, no? Si. Maurizio wants to be part of the family. I can see it in his eyes. But? But, he needs your help. Yeah. Well, how do I help? Maybe we can spend some time together. Yeah, why not? Darling Uncle. Mmm. Maurizio is... He's proud. We all are, darling. We all are. [cattle lowing] I love it. Ah! My dear, you smell that? Smell that! This is legacy. These gorgeous beasts. Do you know that these gorgeous beasts are the direct descendants of the ones Guccio bought way back when? They deserve our respect. They deserve our gratitude. They are Val di Chiana cows. Yes, yes. Hello. [greeting in Italian] I wanna introduce you to my nephew Maurizio and his beautiful new bride, Patrizia. [greeting in Italian] - Here, touch. - Wow, this is soft. Smell it too. It's really great. Let me see this new one. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Aldo ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Bravo, bravo. - Bravo. I am ready! I think I blow 'em out, right? [mutters] Come on! Help me blow these out, please. I like this place. I love this place. Am I boring you? - No. No. - No, no. We love it. My word! Because I can't talk to my son Paolo about any of this. He hates Gucci talk. He only talks about himself. But as you know, he's a strange bird. My son is a strange bird. He's definitely unique. Useless. Sadly. Maurizio! - Yes? - How are you? I'm good. You had a good day today? It was good. I mean, I showed you everything I could show you in one sitting. Yes. Thank you very much, Uncle. - I'm glad. - It's beautiful here. I say this because Patrizia has told me that you may be interested... in learning about our business... whatever. Rodolfo lost a son. Maybe I gain one. Right? See that. Family is important, Maurizio. You can't erase yourself from the family portrait... just because you enjoy playing with trucks. This is the happiest I've been in my life. Why change that? You... You're so much more than this.

Wonderful. - You look good. - Thank you. But you... Well, that looks great on you. - Gucci. - Gucci? Looks that good! We're so surprised. Yeah, Patrizia is just playing dress-up. Yeah. Well, here's a little secret. Don't tell anybody. See? Come here, Patrizia. I got something I want to show you. Sorry, Mauri, don't take it personally. Anything you see is yours. You want it, you see it, it's yours. - Family discount. - [man] Mr. Gucci! Yes! Excuse me. [greeting in Japanese] [Aldo] Hi! How are you? [Aldo] So what do you think? What could you do, Maurizio? Ah, yes. - Grazie. - Grazie. Gucci world affairs coordinator. What? What does that even mean? I don't know. It means something. You'll be my eyes and ears when I'm away. You'll represent the company. With foreign buyers or anybody else. 'Cause with your knowledge of the law, your language skills... You fit right in. Thank you. We're flattered and we're grateful. [Aldo] I'm glad. I know you are. Yes? Yes? [sighs] What are you thinking? I'm thinking. I'm thinking, I'm thinking... and thinking and thinking. I'm thinking, I'll certainly think about it. [in Italian] - Franco. - Morning, sir. Just in time. Here. Help me. Yes, of course. Boof. [door closes] Hello, Uncle. My favorite uncle. Hello. Wow. So svelte. [Rodolfo chuckles] Your cheek bones could cut a diamond. Oh, please. To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure? Well, I came first and foremost... to say... Well... Hmm? Hello. Well, hello! Uh, was there anything else? [speaks Italian] Maurizio and my father have been spending a lot of time together in New York. And I thought... maybe you and I could do the same. Why would I... [Paolo] Well, to discuss... [Rodolfo] To discuss what? My ideas. - You have ideas? - Boof. Does an elephant shit in the jungle? I was born with a gift. I am an artist. My father, he just won't see it. But... These are yours? How come the family doesn't know you have a gift? Domenico, did you know Paolo had a gift? I'm afraid I did not, sir. Well, we both know he's blind in one eye and deaf in the other. So. - This is... - Oh, wait. Let me show you. [speaks Italian] These were inspired by my trip to Cuba. I call this collection... "Havana Libre." Lots of pastels. Rum inspired, sun-soaked and lots of browns. You have pastels and brown together. Yes, yes, yes. I know, it's musical. Paolo. Yeah. You must not show these to anyone. Keep them hidden. I mean it. You feel they might steal my ideas, right? Oh, call me a lawyer. Not you. Over the years, I have found... that true talent is often unaware of its own brilliance. It must be cherished and protected. Whereas hacks, they run around... shouting their delicious ideas, begging to be recognized. Blind... to their own... mediocrity. My dear nephew, you have achieved a triumph of mediocrity. And you have also achieved the unimaginable. You have found one thing... upon which your father and I can agree. Your total incompetence. Oh, no. Forgive me. But I... I have to take a meeting. You designed this scarf, correct? Oh, yes. That scarf is my signature. It has caressed the necks of all the world's beauties. Jackie O, Grace, Sofia. Study it closely. No browns, no pastels. - Come. - Yes. [door closes] I don't need anyone. I'm Paolo. Paolo Gucci. And I am going to start... my own line. [baby cooing] Mr. Gucci. - Are you okay? - Si, si. [baby fusses] Grazie. My father is ill. - Ciao, Franco. - Ciao, Franco. Maurizio. [coughing] Excuse me. Excuse me. What is this? I'm a grandfather? [Patrizia] Her name is Alessandra. Like Maurizio's mother. Whose idea was that? Mine. Well... Alessandra. Here. Come here. Come, come, come. My boy. You take care of Gucci now. Hmm? I'm glad it wasn't a boy. We need more women in this family. [indistinct chattering] There is no love on Earth greater than that of a father for his son. With a few exceptions. Thank you for coming, Uncle. Come to New York. Join the family. Make him proud. I'll think about it. Yeah. [Domenico] The house in St. Moritz. Two beach houses, one in Nassau, the other in Taormina. Twenty-three horses. Penthouse apartment in Galleria Passarella... the only one in all of Milan with a swimming pool. And, of course, 50% of Gucci S.P.A. But... there is a slight complication. He, Rodolfo, he never signed the share certificate. [Maurizio] Okay, what does that mean? [Domenico] You'll have to pay inheritance tax. Oh, that's fine. How much are we talking? [Domenico] Could be as high as 14 billion lire. - [Maurizio] 14 billion? - Yeah. I can't afford that. Well, you could sell your shares. [Maurizio] To who? - I can think of a few qualified individuals. - Thank you. Leave them with us. We'll review them as soon as we're done mourning. Of course. Who does he think he is? Suggesting you sell your shares. Madness. Fourteen billion is totally unreasonable. And just because your father forgot to sign it. [Giuseppina] Ten of spades represents theft or loss. Someone wants what is yours. Don't let them take it. And don't trust anybody. Because I see an abuse of trust. An attempt to deceive you in your own house. You understand? Yes, Pina. Always have something red on you for protection. And wear more green. Green is for cleansing. Green doesn't go with my lipstick. - Change your lipstick. - [Patrizia laughs] You're already so beautiful. Or wear green underwear. Maybe it's time for you to take back. Don't let these forces around you dictate who you are. You're strong. You're magnificent. And... Hmm, look at this. There's a great love in your life. Together, you can conquer the world. Patrizia, look at me. You will be the queen. You. ["I Feel Love" playing] Hi! What a beauty. What a beauty. So good to see you. Come. Come. Much to show you. This is your new office. Wow.

Which Gucci store did he go to? [people chattering] [Patrizia] Who is making this stuff? Who's allowing this to happen? As far as fakes go, they're pretty good. I mean, I'd buy them. [chuckles] Don't be such a cretin. Don't call me a cretin, sweetie. That's not what I said. I asked you not to be one. This is serious and you're laughing it off. At least it's my name on the mugs, not yours. Our name, sweetie. On junk! [Aldo] They're not fake, by the way. They're replicas. I was just very, very surprised. Well, you know what else would surprise you? How profitable this stuff is. What about quality? Your sacred cows? [Aldo] Quality is for the rich. If a Long Island housewife wants to... live with the illusion that she is a Gucci customer... why not? Let her. Because it damages Gucci's credibility. Patrizia, this is us. This is not a girl's game. [Maurizio] Yeah, but, Aldo, she's right. This stuff is junk. It's not what Gucci is. Gucci... is what I say it is. I turned it into an empire. Not Rodolfo. Certainly not my son. And, uh... of course, not you, so... Without me... you'd all still be shoveling cow shit in Tuscany. That's a fact. Remember that. We should remember that. [upbeat music playing] Brava! [woman] Bravo! Bravo! [audience cheering] A martini, please. [bartender] Yes, sir. Did you like the show? Oh, it was incredible. The... The... The lines and tones. Well, what's your name? My name? Maurizio. Maurizio what? Maurizio Gucci. Maurizio Gucci. How about that? Gucci. You know, I used to dress windows for Gucci. Oh, really? Which store? I can't remember. It was... It was God-awful though. Walter, by the way. I'm a designer. Okay, Walter. Well, maybe you will design for me someday. No. No designer here's gonna work for Gucci. Right now, Gucci... Gucci's just a cheap operetta. - Grazia. - Salud. Well, enjoy yourself. Do you want to be left in the dust? You want to keep selling coffee mugs in airports? Is that your legacy? It's time to take out the trash. Aldo and Paolo, they're poison. They're an embarrassment to this company... and everybody knows it. They have to go. And you need to get your fucking business organized. [Maurizio] Patrizia... they're my family. [exhales] So am I. He's starting a trade war. Paolo barely has enough to bankroll a pair of socks, let alone start a war with anyone. I don't want to see it. [Domenico] Yes, but he could still be a problem. Aldo has awarded him a number of shares in the company. Yes, but Aldo didn't realize what an idiot Paolo turned out to be. Maurizio, we need to build a bridge with Paolo and work things out. You know how emotional he gets. He's around all this male energy all the time. His wife isn't exactly the brightest. He needs someone he can talk to, who he trusts, who listens to him. Someone like who? [laughs] - Paolo likes me. - [Domenico scoffs] You do have a natural advantage. You are not a Gucci. I... I need an espresso. Can I ask you a question? You just did. Huh? You just asked me a question. And what you really want to know is whether you can ask me two questions, one of which you've already asked. [laughing] That's good. Domenico, very funny. Okay, here is my second question. What do you see as being your purpose at Gucci? Is this a job interview? Maybe. I'm a conservationist. Gucci is a rare animal. It must be protected. Protected from who? From whoever threatens it. I find it very interesting that you have such a strong connection to that which is not yours. Uh... Sometimes it takes an outsider to see the truth. Bravo. Paolo, this one reminds me of childhood. Yeah, well, it's a memory wrapped in lycra. It's just so you. It's exquisite. Do you think so? You have a gift, I'm telling you. Oh, well, stop. Stop, you're going to make me... you're going to make me cry. Nobody has ever said that to me. Nobody. Paolo, why don't you have your own line? These are just mock-ups. I can't afford to get serious. With your gift, and your talent, and your vision... Are you kidding? Gucci needs new blood. Goodbye 1930s. Hello, '80s. Huh? Oh, you took the words right out of my guts. - Paolo Gucci is coming. - [Paolo scatting] Come on. [continues scatting] [groans] [sighs] I'm disgusted by the way your father treats you. [sighs] Leaving you behind to groom Maurizio. It's not right. Who does he think he is? Well, a dinosaur posing as a butthole. [chuckles] [laughing] You were a comedian in a past life. [Paolo wheezing] Maurizio likes you. - [Paolo] Ah... - He always has. Well, I like my cousin too. He's quiet like a... like a little mouse. Uh, tiny little mousy. Doesn't scream like the others. No, he doesn't. And you and Maurizio together... That would be amazing. - That's a new chapter for Gucci. - [Paolo] No, no, no. My father, he would never allow it. He's got my little peaches in a very tight grip. Paolo... maybe it's time... to respectfully... leave him behind. You are justified. I do have... something on my father. Can you keep a secret? Cross your heart and hope to die. Father, Son, and House of Gucci. [Paolo] Okay. Okay. Well, you know... [Patrizia] You don't have to tell me. - Listen... - It's just... I can come back any time. We can talk about your designs. But what would I get out of this? We could offer you an exclusive deal to distribute your own line under Gucci. I should talk to Maurizio. [Maurizio] You talked to him? When? [thunder rumbling] Today. He showed me his designs. Why didn't you tell me? [Patrizia] I'm telling you now, aren't I? [sputters] Patrizia, that's not the point. Don't focus on the process, focus on the result. I told him... we'd distribute his clothing line under Gucci and he committed to a deal. Maurizio, those designs won't see the light of day. We need Paolo on our side. What game are you playing? I'm looking out for our best interests. Is that a game? [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [beeps] [Paolo exclaims] Mau, Mau! Thank you for coming. You thought I lost my touch. No, not yet. [Maurizio] Ciao, Paolo. You sounded urgent, so I came right away. Very well. I got these from three of his ex "secretaries." He's not exactly a favorite among the ex's. In fact, they all hate his guts. Gucci is a very black hole of undeclared income. Paolo, this is fraud... on a global scale. In Italy taxes are okay, but in America... it is very different. We should keep this to ourselves. [sputters] But we can use it... as leverage to persuade him a bit. And with you... on my side... we have the majority we need for you to become your own man. And he won't get into any real trouble, right? No. [sputters] At this point... worst case scenario, he pays his taxes. They slap his wrists. Happens all the time. But more importantly, he would see you. He would see you. [sighs] I could finally soar... [exhales] like a pigeon. [Paolo] I'm tired of being held back. Father, I'm tired of being held back. I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm tired of being held back. I want freedom. I'm serious. No, I'm serious. Hello? Hello? - Yeah. The... - [Paolo] Hello, can you hear me? No, it's a terrible line, and I... [Paolo] Can you hear me now? - I can call you back. - No, no. It's midnight. It's late here. Just tell me what's on your mind. What happened? I, uh... I want my freedom. I'm tired of being held back. I'm serious. [Aldo] Freedom? Uh... Paolo, please just wait till tomorrow. I'll talk to you about it tomorrow, all right? I'm busy here. I have your tax filings. Taxes? What are you talking about? - That's it, Paolo. - I don't want to expose you, Father. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Go to bed. - You need to go to bed, Paolo. All right? - I, uh...

[Maurizio] Paolo, no, no, no. He'll be fine. I'm sending a draft of your contract next week and we'll go into production on your line soon after. [Paolo] My line? How can I think about my line when my father could be dropping the soap? [sighs] Paolo, isn't this what you wanted? [indistinct chatter] [upbeat music playing] Paolo... how could you do this to me? [gavel banging] Mr. Aldo Gucci. This court finds you guilty of five counts of failure to file accurate tax returns, one count of failure to file a report of a foreign bank account, and two counts of bank fraud. I hereby sentence you to a year and a day in a state penitentiary. Court will stand adjourned. [gavel pounds] [woman singing opera] Good evening. Are you Paolo Gucci? The one and only. Another parking ticket? "Cease and desist"? Well, you've broken certain exclusive rights granted to the copyright holder such as the right to reproduce, distribute, display or perform a protected work. Copyright holder? I am the copyright. I am sorry. - Do something. - But it's Gucci S.P.A. Oh. [woman singing opera] Please, the show is over. Thank you. Towards the exit, please. We have to go, please, everyone. Get down from the catwalk. Keep moving, please. The show is over. Towards the exit. [stops singing] [car honks] [Maurizio] Paolo. Why? Why? Why did you do it? - Do what? - What happened? [Paolo] Don't even look at me, you lying sack of potatoes. - Shut your fucking mouth. - Paolo. - We are outside the church. - Paolo! - You shut your fucking mouth. - You shut your mouth. Think about Alessandra. [Patrizia] Get her in the car. - Put Alessandra in the car. - Paolo, what's wrong? You... - And you! - Okay. Okay! You ripped my heart out, let it die in the street. Oh, my God. My wife... My wife had to sing till her voice was hoarse... while we figured out what the fuck was going on. Why did you report me for copyright breach? Gucci is my name too.

I want to do right by you. But, Paolo, we have a proposition for you. It's the only way. [scoffs] Sorry. We want to buy your shares of Gucci. [chuckling] You got some courage, you know that? And she has bigger mangoes than you. You're a character, you know that? My quiet lawyer cousin. - Okay. Okay. - The tiny little mouse is a character. - Hey, watch out. - Who knew?

I'd rather see Gucci burn than to hand it over to you two bastards. Ciao. Come on, let's go. [Paolo groans] Paolo... Let's go, Maurizio. Come on. How do you know all this? Maurizio, could you...

[speaking Italian] Thank you, Roberto. [Patrizia] You're not listening to me. I'm here to help you. Thank you, Signora Gucci. We just need to perform a few more analyses. [Patrizia] Please, let me help you. I'm very resourceful. Let's discuss. We have nothing more to say at this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Patrizia, please. Please. - Goodbye, Signora Gucci. - Domenico, please. [gasping] It took you fucking long enough. Maurizio called from St. Moritz... and he said you can join him there whenever you want.

[man] Maurizio, Maurizio! [Maurizio] Hey... [chuckling] [Patrizia] Hope I'm not interrupting. No, of course not. You're not interrupting. I see you've put up the tree. [Maurizio] Yes. Yes. Everybody, this is Patrizia. - Hey, Patrizia. - And this is Alessandra. - Hello. - Franco and Gianni, you know, of course. This is my friend Paola... and these are all of her slaves. [all chuckling] Alessandra. Oh, sorry. What do you think of the macaroons? This hazelnut one is to die for. Yeah. Where did you get 'em? There is this charming little place by Notre-Dame-de-Lorette in Paris. "De-Lorette." Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. - Right. - De-Lorette. Maurizio and I stayed there five years ago. We had the most amazing time. I begged Maurizio to take me there for my 25th birthday. And of course, he obliged. As soon as we landed, we went to the Jules Verne restaurant... in the Eiffel Tower. It's at the top. No, no, no. It's on the second floor. It was magnificent. Later we went to the Louvre. I'd always dreamt of seeing the Louvre. We arranged for a private tour. Thank God. Imagine all those crowds. I couldn't do it. They just want to know where you got the macaroons, sweetie. I'm telling them. Yeah, you're filling the story full of unnecessary details. [Patrizia] I don't think our guests mind. They wouldn't say if they did. You're an unnecessary detail. [laughing] What I am trying to tell you is... De Sole is the only person who saw the unsigned certificates. He worked for my father for ten years and he never questioned him. I trust him. He's not the problem. I heard the way you spoke to me at lunch. He's not the problem? [Maurizio] I was tired. Next time, don't embarrass me in front of those people. Those people are friends of mine. I've known most of them longer than you. He is the problem. Say it! Patrizia, I was tired. I'm tired. Then wake yourself up and say it. [Maurizio] Okay. When you make me sneak around my own family. When you set father and son against each other... and me against Paolo. When you second-guess a person like Domenico De Sole... the only person my father trusted. These things have an effect on the environment I operate in. On me. Actions have consequences. [Patrizia] I did that for you. I was being constructive. I'm not gonna apologize for that. No thanks. My uncle is in prison and my cousin thinks I'm scum. And you think that's constructive? Don't pin Gucci's problems on me, okay? I'm just here mopping up your fucking mess. I never asked for your help. Maurizio... we're only stronger together. [sighs] The only thing I need from you... is to stay away from Gucci before you cause any more damage. I can handle it by myself. Is that clear? Truthfully, I'm only getting involved... because you are an incompetent, little baby idiot. You're a fucking weak little brat. You really are only one half of Gucci. The shit half. And you want a real man? Here. Maybe you'll grow a little. - [game beeping] - [Maurizio] Red, green, red, green. Red. - Green. - [Maurizio] Red. - [Alessandra] Green. - [Maurizio] Very good, Alessandra. - Green, red. - [Alessandra] Green. - [Maurizio] Green, red. - [Alessandra] Green. - I think that's it. - [Alessandra] Green. [Maurizio] Red, green, red, green, red, blue. [both] Red, green. Red, green. Red, blue. [Maurizio] Red, green, red, green, red, blue. Yellow. Okay. - Red. Green. Red. Green. Red. - Red. Green. Red. Green. - Blue. Yellow. - Blue. Yellow. - You're very... - The winner. [chuckling] The winner gets a present. For Alessandra. [Alessandra] Thank you, Mommy. We'll play later. Who is that? Turn it around. Who is that... Who is hiding in there? I love you. I love you. - [speaking Italian] - Merry Christmas. Do you like him? For Daddy, from me. You can change the strap if you don't like that color. Oh, no. It's fine. Okay. Thank you. For Mommy, from Daddy. Mmm... I never know what to get you. I'm sure it's perfect. A Bloomingdale's gift card. Yeah, now you can get what you want. You know I never shop there. Well, there is a first time for everything. [people chattering] - Paola, darling. - Oh. Love the all-white outfit. So chic. I made some strudel for you and M. It's the only thing I know how to make. I'm on a diet, but I'm sure Maurizio will love your strudel. Oh. Would you like a cigarette? No. [thanking in Italian] You ever steal anything, Paola? What? Forgive me. I am trying to teach Alessandra... the importance of not touching other people's belongings. I don't consider myself a particularly ethical person... but I am fair. What I cannot wrap my head around... is people who steal just for ego. Or the pleasure of it. For personal satisfaction. I'll have my maid drop off the strudel. Good to see you. [scoffs] [clock chiming] [clears throat] [Patrizia] Do you like my hair? Maurizio, do you like my hair? Oh, yes, very nice. Very chic. I was thinking, tomorrow... Franco is coming tomorrow at noon. Why? To take you both back to Milan. Can we at least talk about it? [sobs] I'll find the right words to say what I want to say when I'm ready. You really, really hurt me. [door closes] Paolo won't do it. He's too scared of his father. [Domenico] He's drowning in debt. But we can't buy him out. We need a cash partner, Maurizio. Who do you suggest? Investcorp. It's owned by Nemir Kirdar. He's an Iraqi powerhouse. They like high-end retail investments. They bought Tiffany's in '84 and turned it around quick. Maurizio. [Maurizio] Plant the seed with him. I'll be back soon. [Patrizia] Something's different. Maurizio's changed. He's excessive... and crazy. And that woman... [Giuseppina] Don't be scared. He's nothing without you. Hmm? Men have an awful problem with thinking they are smarter than they actually are. You mustn't let this negative energy eat you up. Huh? Remember... you are unstoppable, Patrizia. Say it. I'm unstoppable. I'm unstoppable. I am only 50% of Gucci. I'm here representing my own interests. I want someone to bring Gucci to the forefront of today's fashion. I want a partner who can buy out the other half of Gucci... that's giving me a headache. The half that's preventing Gucci from being great. The half that belongs to your uncle and your cousin. Investcorp has had great success with Tiffany. It is... It is a resurrection. True. But Tiffany isn't Gucci. Gucci is a family business. That means family problems. Yeah, well, I brought something for you. Burgundy. Size ten U.S. wide, right? This model is part of the permanent collection... at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. You can't buy it anywhere. And now it is yours.

Fuck a duck, it's over here. What kind of car is it? Fiat 600. - Fiat. - Ah... Fiat 600. Paolo, it's here. Boof. [groans softly] Here. Right here. [groans softly] Boof. - [sighs] - [keys clink] Well... I didn't know you would end up in prison. - What? - I hate myself for it. Don't, please. What did you do here? What is this? Well, I have been a bit stressed. No, it is... - We have to clean this. - Well, my life has been hard. Really hard. - I haven't shit in a week. - No, it's filthy! And that bitch of a wife promised to help me. He shook my hand while she knifed me in the back. - Oh, Paolo. - I've been drowning in legal fees. It's been really, really bad. - I know. - I couldn't even make love. Jenny left. And after that, I was in bed... - Jenny. - ...with a pound of gelato cioccolato... and very dark thoughts. I am back. I am back. We will start where we left off. Okay? I also glad to have you back. Well, it's good to be back too. Well, look at this place. It looks like it's given up. What? - Well... - What? [lighter clicks] What's that? [Paolo] A really good deal. What deal? I met with their lawyers too. I couldn't say no. I needed the cash. I mean look at this dump. I don't even have basic cable. No. I sold my shares of Gucci to them! [yells] No! No! No! No! [sighs] [sighs] I know. I'm done. - No. No. No. - No, I'm done. I'm dead. - I'm dead. - No. I'm dead! Dead! Come. Come here. You're... an idiot. But you're my... you're my idiot. Maurizio, these must've cost you a fortune. Art has no price. I'm scared to touch anything. [Maurizio] Oh, don't be scared. Actually, be a little scared. That... That couch costs more than most people's apartment in Monte Carlo. - Ooh. - [Maurizio chuckles] - I'll try not to make a mess of it. - No, no, no. [Maurizio] Please, please. Make a mess. [soft bossa nova music playing] Gucci will pay for it. For the first time in my life, I can do whatever I want. I like this song. Take me back to Ipanema. I've never been. I've always wanted to go. Let's go. Right now. [bossa nova music continues playing] [clears throat] [counting in Spanish] - Ooh. - [chuckles] - Can you dance salsa? - Of course I can. [Paola chuckles] [Maurizio] I can't. [chuckles] This could be a big mistake. It's not a mistake. It's a choice. You can do what you want now. [bossa nova music continues playing] Tell me where he is. Just tell me where he is, Pina. I couldn't see. You're fucking lying to me! Where the fuck is he? [Patrizia sniffles] [shouting] Tell me where he is? ["Largo Al Factotum" playing] [crowd applauding] [music stops] [playing chatter] - Where is he? - I'm afraid he couldn't come. What do you mean he couldn't come? He had a business in Paris. - He's lying and so are you. - Maurizio is very busy, Patrizia. He didn't even have the decency to come to his daughter's last recital. What kind of a father is he? There will be a new arrangement. And why did he send you, huh? Hey, Domenico, why did he send you? What, you're his little fucking messenger? He didn't have the decency to come here. He's too much of a coward to do it himself? I have the papers right here. Papers? Ah, papers! I'm not signing any papers. You can tell him to come here and talk to me like a fucking normal human being. Maurizio said you and Alessandra can continue to live in the penthouse since it's no longer his primary residence. He's happy to extend payments until you're able to stand on your own two feet. - What are you talking about? - Please. What are you saying? What are you saying to me? Huh? - These are words, Domenico. - Support for Alessandra. - I'm not talking to you. - Shared custody. You come to my daughter's school. What the fuck is wrong with you? Shared custody. He wants... He wants to make this as easy as possible for both of you. [tearfully] Shared custody? Are we talking about divorce? Is that what we're doing here? Where is he right now? [sobbing] Where is he right now? I'm not at liberty to say. Look in my eyes. Do you see anything in these eyes that would let you think that I would ever let anyone ruin my daughter's life? Compromise her. Do you? Do you see that? You know that won't happen. I will relay the message. Get the fuck out of here. Yeah. For your review, Mr. Gucci. We hope you'll find this offer appealing. [Aldo] Well... I'd rather not read my own obituary, no? Maestro, I can assure you there's no greater admirer of Gucci than myself. [chuckling] Oh, God. To be able to finally sit down with a member of the dynasty. It's something we will cherish forever. And truly... I understand how difficult this is. Please don't patronize me. Please. Those words are not comforting to me. They make me feel offended in a way, I must say. Mr. Gucci, I have a plane that leaves in one hour. If there is a problem with the offer... Said and Omar, they're at your disposal. No, no, no. [stuttering] We are very grateful for your offer... except no. Right, Papa? That shoe you showed me before... take a look inside your shoe and see at the heel. There's something you should see. I remember ordering a pair of those... for Clark Gable. 1953. Right before he did the film Mogambo. This is the rarest of shoes. You see that? You see that? It's a gold leaf. You know... I had to stop doing that. It got too expensive. So. Where did you get that shoe? Where? There's no way you bought that shoe in London. Who gave it to you? Would you know? My, he doesn't wanna answer. [Paolo] Well, that's the least... [Aldo] This meeting is over. I broke up the meeting. Where is he going? [Nemir] I'm very sorry. I had no choice. Aldo. [exclaiming] Did you know this? No. No! Maurizio. You fucking traitor. [sighs] [sobs] This is what you want? [grunts] Congratulations. You are now the majority shareholder... of Gucci. You must feel wonderful. Boof. [man] You need to relax. Relax. Relax. You floating. You floating like in the air. Floating. Floating. From there to there. Go left to right. [Maurizio] Ms. Wintour, walk into any one of Gucci's 144 international boutiques and you will find you are walking into a new world. A new vision. But wasn't the lure of Gucci precisely its historical appeal? The legacy is remarkable. [Maurizio] Well, this is true. We are products of our past but we don't have to be prisoners of it. I don't fear change. I embrace it. Where Ralph Lauren stores, they feel like movie sets and Versace is a rock concert, Gucci stores will feel like the Vatican of fashion. ["Ashes to Ashes" playing] Grazie. How are you funding your vision? - [Maurizio] Well, that is a very good secret. - [chuckles] Don't ask. It may take some time to recover... but this is a long-term plan. Sometimes you have to go down to come back up again. Ferre, Armani, and Versace! That's who I said I wanted designing our new line. And they would be honored to be working for us. De Sole, where the fuck are they? Maurizio, they have their own lines. They're their own bosses. I know they have... I've spoken to everybody. Nobody wants to... Then you haven't tried hard enough. There is someone. Maybe. Here. Who am I looking at? He's from Texas. A mechanic? Maybe you should meet him. [man] I see cranked up blacks. Jewel-tone velvet. And unconventional styling touches. Loafers, sans socks. I see pole dancers flanking the runways. Female... and male, of course. I have a vocabulary that will allow you to expand. That's what the brand requires. That's where we need to head. Without sacrificing the family character of what this brand is. The family character is the brand. I'm here to embellish. I'm here to resurrect. [chuckles] [Patrizia] Maurizio. Stop. Please, please, please. I'm begging you. Please stop. Okay, I... I don't want a confrontation. Me neither. I tried calling. Yes, and calling and calling and calling. What do you want? I want to talk. [Maurizio] Okay. Alessandra misses you. I saw Alessandra two weeks ago. She talks about you all the time. And I'll see her very soon. I've been very busy. Will you come back home? [distant dog barking] You bought Aldo and Paolo out. You did what I said. Good night, Patrizia. [Patrizia] Come back home. Patrizia, you know that's... that's not possible. Now, it is getting very late. Go home. If not for me, just for our daughter. [Maurizio] No, no, no. Don't do that. - Don't... - Don't... [Maurizio] I'll take care of her and you. - [bottle clinking] - [people chattering] We made something beautiful together. No, what? Take it. Do you like it? Patrizia, what is this? Do you like it? I made it for you. You're humiliating yourself. Why are you talking to me this way? Because you can't see what you've become. This book... A story has a beginning and an end. And ours ended a few chapters ago. So, what do you want from me now? I want you to myself. I love you. Patrizia... No. I don't love you. I don't hate you... but I don't want to spend the rest of my life with you. Now, I'm sorry. I truly am. What happened to my Maurizio? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I had no idea I married a monster. You didn't. You married a Gucci. He's always away on business. - He moved, you know. - [Giuseppina] Hmm. [Giuseppina] Mmm-hmm. I've told you so many times. He moved into the penthouse with that fucking horse. I've seen them together. Maybe you should stop following them. The things they buy... Antiques worth billions, cars, paintings. With our money. [Giuseppina] That he has thanks to you. He's not even a businessman. He can't even run a parking meter. How the fuck is he gonna run Gucci? [Giuseppina] You're right. I know. I made him what he is. But when you're right, you're right. And you're very, very right. I'm gonna go see him tomorrow. Maybe you should wait until we come back from the Caymans. And then we can... we can do a nice evil eye on him. Hmm? Another spell? We've run out of spells. We need something stronger. Maybe I can still do something that will work. But for that, you have to be positive. I am being very fucking positive. [beeps] [Patrizia] You are a waste of skin that belongs on the front page of every newspaper. [answering machine beeps] I want the world to know what you're really like. I will not give you a minute of peace. [answering machine beeps] You tried to crush me, but you couldn't. [answering machine beeps] You are a painful appendage that needs to be removed. The inferno for you is yet to come. [bird cawing] [greeting in Italian] Two, Rita. Where the fuck are they? If I knew how to use a pistol, I'd fucking do this shit myself. Calm down. Calm down. [Giuseppina] They'll show up. Come sit. [car doors closing] - Thank you. - Enjoy. Pina. Yeah. Ivano, I told Patrizia that I know you since you were a child, huh. That we trust you. I am Ivano Savioni. This is my associate Benedetto Ceraulo. Who does what? Sicilian. How soon can you do it? As soon as we know his routine... and his security. And we are set on our rate. Our rate? What rate? - What is that? - You told me six. Yeah, yeah. - Are you crazy? - Why is he saying eight? - I don't what he's playing. - Why the fuck is he saying eight? - No, I don't know. - We said eight. - No, it's six. 600 million lire. - We said eight. That's it. What are you doing? Keep your fucking voice down. We said eight. - I'd consider it if only it was eight. - Yeah. Somebody else quoted me for far less. Six is all I'm willing to do. It will have to be a rush job then. Yeah. - And you have to provide us now with photographs. - [Patrizia] Uh-uh-uh. Six is all I will pay. We'll give you half now... half later when it's done. Okay. Okay. Don't miss. Deal with her. Really. You don't wanna make any mistakes. Catch. Pay for the coffee and don't fuck this up. 'Cause I'll put a spell on you. [both chuckling] Ready. [upbeat music playing] [audience cheering] Wait. ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ That's amazing. I think he's incredible. Love him. ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ Are you sure this is a Gucci show? Yeah, yeah. Very nice, this jacket, we've talked about for months. It's beautiful. I love it. You're in for a surprise. [upbeat music continues] [audience exclaiming] ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ Very modern. Three, two, one. Go! [crowd cheering] He looks great. Bravo! Bravo! [Tom Ford] "When Tom Ford took over the creative reins of Gucci in 1994... "there was little hope for the Milanese fashion house." "It took a German designer to stir up Chanel... "and it is an American who has put Gucci far and away in the front of fashion." "Some say Mr. Ford will give Mr. Lagerfeld a run for his money." I have to call my mother in Austin. [speaking other language] What an unforgettable night. Maurizio. And the response is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. Indeed. It marks a new chapter for Gucci. Hey, try the carpaccio. It melts in your mouth. Okay. [speaking other language] I think we can all be honest with each other around this table, yeah? We're all friends here. We can, we all respect each other. [Maurizio] Grazie. We're very concerned. What concerns you? Numbers. Specifically, Gucci's. Well, you said you didn't care about numbers. That you trusted your instinct. Yeah. I care about numbers when they're terrible numbers. Our projections for 1996 are abysmal. By slashing hundreds of profitable items... You mean my uncle's knickknacks? [man] Losses are likely to total $30 million this year on sales of $180 million. Down from $210 million in 1991. And $270 million. There is $85 million in bank debts. We may even have trouble paying salaries for the next couple of months. Profits remain elusive. And I've always said that our strategic plan would take five years. It's not about immediate profit. You go down to come back up again. That is how you get out of a stall. But the personal items are a concern as well. All paid for through Gucci's accounts and charged as expenses. The multimillion-dollar antiques in the stores. The purchase of countless cars including a Ferrari F40 and a Lamborghini Countach. $3 million on a watch, a Patek Philippe 2523. $7 million on a luxury penthouse. I could go on and on. An 18th century palatial villa outside Florence for use as a training center. I have justifications for all of these things but it doesn't seem that you're in a place to hear them. Maurizio, please try and take this in the spirit of our friendship. We've been through a lot together. You have many qualities. But we must be realistic. You're not a natural manager. You can't run a business purely on charm and eccentricities. No. You need time as well. Last night does mark a new chapter for Gucci and I am the one that brought it to you. Maurizio, I want you to understand whatever happens between both of our companies, I have never stopped respecting you or your vision. But I have vision for my people too. And I have a business to run. We want to offer you $150 million for your 50% stake in Gucci. [chuckles softly] You want to buy me out. [Domenico] We want to save the business. And who would be appointed CEO? [chuckles] She was right about you. $150 million. You'll be a rich man. If you really think it's about money, then you know less about Gucci than I thought. [speaking other language] [speaking other language] - Excuse me. - Yes. This meat. Where is it coming from? This is the finest beef in Tuscany. It comes from the Val di Chiana. The cows are treated like royalty. [sighs] [door slams shut] [intense music playing] [horn blaring incessantly] [alarm beeping] That's him. - Good morning! - [Maurizio greeting in Italian] Signor Gucci? - [gunshot] - [grunts] - [gunshot] - [groaning] What's going on? [man groans] [soft instrumental music playing] [indistinct chatter] [horns honking] [reporters clamoring] [sighs] Patrizia. [Patrizia crying] I know. Please see Signorina Franchi out of my house. ["Baby Can I Hold You" playing] [male judge] Signora Reggiani. Signora Reggiani. [gavel banging] Signora Reggiani. [gavel pounding] You can call me Signora Gucci.
