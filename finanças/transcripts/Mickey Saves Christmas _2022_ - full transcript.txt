Speaking of Santa, it's getting late. So, if we're gonna play fetch, we better do it now. Right, Pluto? Quackers. It is late. We better get to beddy-bye, so Santy Claus can come. I already set out his milk and cookies. This was for Santa? Okay, pal. We only have time for a few throws, okay? Oh, no! I better fix that light before Santa arrives. Pluto, stop! Ho, ho, ho. What a beautiful Christmas Eve. Mickey and his pals are next. Got their presents right here. And there's the cabin Mickey mentioned in his letter. It'd be pretty hard to miss that. Down, Dasher.

I'm just fine, Mickey. Thank you. That could have been a lot worse. I think it just got worse. Were those our presents? No, no, your presents were in the sleigh. But everything in that bag were toys for the children of Hot Dog Hills. Quackers! You mean, Susie's soccer goal? - And Elray's train? - And Pearl's doll stroller? All at the bottom of the lake. Aw, pal, I know you didn't mean any harm. I'm in a jingle jam, all right. My elves have already left to spend Christmas with their families. I haven't got any helpers to get those toys remade in time. Why, yes you do, Santa. Us. We've already been elves once tonight. Mickey. Minnie. I love to see such Christmas spirit. That means... I can hardly believe it. We get to go to… The North Pole! You can't fly without your magical harness, Prancer. Wow. Wow. Santa, is your sleigh always this heavy? Hang on, Goofy. I'll come help you push. - Everyone ready? - I think so. Up, Dasher! Up, Dancer! Away! Oh. My, my, my, my. Sure is cold. Warm beverage anyone? It's delicious.

We've gotta get out of this mess, but we're all tied up like a Christmas gift. Well, if anyone knows how to untie a bow… it's me! I hate to think of our Prancer out there, all alone.

Well, uh, if Santa can't get to us, then we have to find a way to deliver these presents ourselves and before the kids of Hot Dog Hills wake up. What is it, Jingle and Jolly? What do you know? Santa's got an old junker. Santa's old sleigh? Maybe we can fix it up, and Jingle and Jolly can fly it. I think this just might work. Come on, Pluto. Sit here with me. Okay, gang. Let's head for Hot Dog Hills. Up, Jingle. Up, Jolly. Away! Rats. The sleigh's too heavy for 'em. Oh, poor dear Pluto. He must feel so terrible about the accident at the cabin. Pluto, you shouldn't feel bad. All you wanted was for us to play fetch together. You kept trying, and I kept saying, "Not now." Didn't I, pal? I was so busy rushing around trying to put up lights and decorations that I pushed aside my best friend. If I had just stopped and played with you then, maybe all those toys for the kids of Hot Dog Hills wouldn't be at the bottom of the lake. And you wouldn't feel so sad right now. I'm sorry, Pluto. Oh, Mickey, you were just trying to show us how much you care. I think sometimes we all get too busy at Christmas time. Yeah, and we forget that spending time together is what makes Christmas so merry and bright. No matter how many lights or decorations. You betcha! You're right, everybody. It's not about the number of lights and decorations. Christmas is special because of those we spend it with. And I wanna spend my Christmas with all of you delivering these toys. But we're still stuck here. If only we had another reindeer. Yeah. A strong one. Pluto? Your reindeer antlers. You wanna help pull the sleigh, Pluto? Great idea! Let's get you a… harness.
