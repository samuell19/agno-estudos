These cakes look delicious! You have this one I'll take this You liked your coffee black, right? What are you...? Thanks for coming The victim? Yoshiko Ikehata, 28 A single female, jobless Who found her body? A neighbour called the police when she heard screaming and strange noises So a police patrol went to the flat and broke in The left carotid artery and throat have been cut with a sharp blade Additionally, there are stab wounds under each shoulder blade And a huge gouge under the left breast The murder weapon? It hasn't been found yet But what was it? It seems to have been a sharp blade Not scissors or a knife though Neither was it a kitchen tool These wounds are horrific A terrible murder for sure A murder of rancour rather than a robbery Isn't it a crime of passion? Hmm? The neighbour said she had highly tempestuous relationships with men What sort of guys? A property speculator living in the vicinity and his sons She enticed five or six men to this flat, one after another So one of them brought these cakes... and slashed Yoshiko Ikehata as she served coffee? So it seems, although there's no cake box The assailant took it Find the bakery that made this Did the victim smoke? No, she didn't Perhaps the assailant does Foreign cigarettes Check out the blood type on this The flat's undamaged, but the wardrobe's a mess Why? Probably the assailant was wiping the blood from his hands Why use these clothes? Bloody handprints? An abhorrent murder... Ah, Mr Akutsu You found out Yoshiko Ikehata's killer then No, not yet You're with Eastern News? Yes, that's correct You know Koichi Omoda? Mr Omoda? I certainly do He was copy editor when I joined its local news section I was put through the wringer What's he like? Let me see... As a journalist, one of the best Five years ago he left Eastern News, now he reports for the Monthly Koron Does he have some connection to this case? Mr Omoda You were going to meet Yoshiko Ikehata tonight, weren't you? As you see There's a memo on the calendar from her apartment What of it? What was your relationship to her? I only met her three days ago What for? For work And? Detective, I'm an investigative reporter I can't reveal details about my work Ah, Hope cigarettes? What about foreign brands? I only smoke these Where were you last night? My alibi? I'd drinks with the Monthly Koron's chief editor So you see, I'm not Yoshiko Ikehata's lover Then you know about her affairs? She was a maid at Ikki Hata's residence She was dismissed for a fling with a visiting salesman Ikki Hata? A ministerial secretary He pulls the strings behind the scenes for the political candidate Isozaki I just wanted to ask Yoshiko Ikehata about Ikki Hata's everyday activities I guess I can leave Ah, I'm blood type O You can check with this cigarette butt Mr Omoda Well, it's Sudo How's it going? Not too bad, I guess You've done some great reporting for the Monthly Koron Revealing the underbelly of the political world I don't do it alone I have the team behind me You're lucky you can devote yourself to what you love I wish I had that talent... Sudo It's not talent that is necessary But a determination to track down your prey I think I can match anyone for determination Excellent, you should work alongside me Anyway, you've been assigned to this case? Yes By the way Why were you called in for questioning today? Yoshiko Ikehata had a lot to tell me It was regarding a story I've been pursuing I'm really upset about Yoshiko Ikehata's murder My investigation's come to a shuddering halt Mr Omoda What exactly are you pursuing? Tell me Okay Let's go for a drink tonight You can also hear my whinging Do you know a cheap place in Akasaka or Roppongi? I need a refill! Miyo Sorry I'm late Oh, he's an acquaintance? Yes, he's my old mentor Mr Omoda This is the proprietress Pleased to meet you My name's Yukiko I thought about leaving because of the hostile service Well, that's a bad habit of hers She treats new customers really coldly Yukiko May I use the back? I'll be having an involved discussion That's fine, please feel free This way Shall we begin? What did you want to find out from Yoshiko Ikehata? You're a journalist too You know what sort of man Ikki Hata is? He's the principal secretary of conservative party candidate Isozaki The master manipulator in the background However He didn't turn Isozaki into a major figure It was a woman called Seiga Ikki Hata's common law wife Seiga? As in Blue Moth Seiga, written as Blue Moth An unusual name It is The name of a mysterious fortune teller Seiga lives with Ikki Hata in a huge residence in Takanawa, surrounded by 3 maids, 2 chauffeurs, 4 or 5 servants and several dogs She examines a handprint in order to divine someone's fortune or prospects And her readings seem very accurate Isozaki's candidacy came about just as Seiga predicted But her reputation spread Now big shot politicians get a forecast from her before making a major decision They call it the pilgrimage to Takanawa Seiga only sees the handprints of people chosen by Ikki Hata One divination apparently earns 3 to 5 million yen It's absurd that politicians are influenced by fortune telling So the future of Japan is going to be determined by Seiga? I wouldn't go that far But that's how our politicians work They don't have the strength to make their own decisions What sort of woman is this Seiga? I have no idea No one has seen her clearly Her real name and history are a complete mystery Secluded at the Takanawa residence, she shuns any contact with the media It makes you wonder why that is Maybe she's guarding a secret She is I've called at the Takanawa residence many times in an attempt to reveal it But I'm always turned away I've nothing to go on I was at a loss... Then I got wind one of Seiga's maids, Yoshiko Ikehata, had been dismissed I promptly met with her Three days ago It's about Seiga? I do have some knowledge She's pretends to be Japan's top palmist But she uses underhand methods However, I won't talk for free You want money? Naturally I'd like five million yen Since I've lost my job That's quite exorbitant I can get it for you, but is what you have really worth it? If you need to see evidence... Seiga is searching for a man with this hand pattern... when she does a palm reading And why is that? It will cost five million yen to find out How did you obtain this handprint? I stole it from Seiga of course That woman nonchalantly cast me aside I want to get my own back by telling you her secret Okay I'll consult my chief editor about raising the five million yen In three days, I'll hear the full story at your flat I'll look after this Here's the hand print Yoshiko Ikehata was going to reveal to me Seiga's secret tonight And last night she was murdered What do you infer? Seiga killed Yoshiko in order to protect her secret? I'm sure that's it Although, typically... the police seem to think she was killed due to her romantic entanglements It would be a great scandal... if it was Seiga Anyhow I don't know if she's a political shaman But to kill someone so inhumanely is unpardonable I want to find proof that Seiga is the culprit But I can't do it alone Sudo Will you help me? Sounds interesting I'll do it Ha ha... you will! Well, I'd like to stay informed of police activity Okay Alright... Tonight, we drink to celebrate the start of our quest Would you like some more snacks? It seems someone was listening in It's okay She's famously tight lipped I don't know In the west, they say only a woman's kneecaps are tough Could you prove that to me with your body? Don't be so silly This one likes joking around The proprietress is an attractive woman You're in love? Yes I am I always frequent this bar because I'm infatuated with her But Yukiko is so cold, it won't go anywhere She always rejects the other customers too Perhaps she finds men despicable? Or does she have someone? What do you think? Mr Omoda! Hey! My house is close by so you take the taxi Let's go somewhere for another drink Drink any more and you won't be able to walk Rain? You can flag down a taxi from the street over there Thanks It must be challenging Working as a reporter However, I wonder if that woman called Seiga really is the culprit So you were listening? It's a small bar, so I could hear you What is it? It hurts somewhere? It's... my joints My back's gone numb And I can't breathe... Where do you live? It's nearby Then I'll escort you Hold on to me You made me jump You stayed to watch over me? That's very considerate It's because you lost consciousness after slumping on the bed I wondered if you would die like that The pain's gone? It's all better now In the last seven or eight years, on cold or wet days... I've been having sudden attacks of joint pain I end up lying comatose for two or three hours That's awful Er... Your wife? We're long divorced Clash of personalities As you see, I'm living by myself in this flat Each morning, I get up at 10 o'clock And I go to bed late at 2 or 3 o'clock The routine of a dying middle-aged man What are you dying of? Not sure But I smoke 80 cigarettes a day Cancer I guess its lung cancer Anyhow, I won't live very long So I'll throw myself into my work before I die How about a drink? If I accept a drink, I'll have to stay That's the aim However Even if I'm dying of cancer, I'd rather not die alone I want to die with someone like you I don't think I'll have a long life either Are you ill as well? Yes, psychologically Psychologically? I'll die soon That's what I want I want to die! You poor soul... Hey, Akutsu Regarding the ransacked wardrobe... Maybe the assailant was searching for clothes that would fit What? In other words Having been covered in blood, the killer wanted to change clothes The murderer was a woman then You think it's a woman! It's a possibility A jealous woman who'd had her man taken from her They say nowadays women are crueller than men when push comes to shove What's more, the bloody palm prints were thoroughly examined It's believed not all of them were left by Yoshiko Ikehata Doesn't that mean the assailant's were mingled amongst them? Mr Shibusawa! We found who sold the cakes at the scene of the murder The customer who bought them was a woman wearing sunglasses Hello? Ah, it's you There's news? They've determined that the murderer was a woman The bloody handprints of a woman found on the wall seem to be the killer's And it's been established a woman in sunglasses bought those cakes The culprit's a woman! It's looking more and more like Seiga Thanks Goodbye Ikki Hata and Seiga So Seiga wears sunglasses Chief! Oh, Omoda Well, if Seiga killed Yoshiko Ikehata it would be an unprecedented case The Monthly Koron will cover all your expenses I certainly want that report But is there any evidence Seiga did it? No, it's just my intuition Seiga bumped off Yoshiko Ikehata in order to guard her secret What's her secret? Any idea? None at all I want to bring it to light But Seiga is well protected How will you expose her? I've an idea I'll investigate Ikki Hata's past To find out when and where he came to join forces with Seiga I seem to recall Ikki Hata was in the Ministry of Finance He joins the ministry in April, 1959 The tax bureau office In 1964, becomes director of the Maebashi tax office He rose rapidly Like a bureaucrat on the fast track 1965, returns to Ministry of Finance as assistant chief at the banking bureau But two years later suddenly resigns Why's that? He fails to get married Get married? Ikki Hata sought to advance his career by marrying this politician's daughter But she married a rival and he ended up getting demoted The tax office in Kyushu Then he gives up on being a public official And takes up a top position at a company called Akagi Foods You've done your homework It seems Ikki Hata somehow gets to know Seiga around that time I'm heading off to Akagi Foods to make inquiries It's a bit concerning What is? If you dig too deeply into Seiga's past you could be killed this time Like Yoshiko Ikehata... This is Koichi Omoda, not some bumbling novice! Ikki Hata is a really pushy guy, wouldn't you say? He strode into my company one day demanding a top job It's because he did me a few favours when he was a public official I had to make him an executive But a year later, suddenly he said he wouldn't waste any more time here He wanted to be a parliamentary secretary What led him to politics? It was recommended by a fortune teller He was told he'd be successful That fortune teller was a woman? You're well informed! That woman was the proprietress of a bar But apparently she was very adept at reading palms A proprietress? Where was the bar? Azabu, near Ichinohashi I went there just once after Mr Hata invited me And the name of the proprietress? Mr Hata was close to her He addressed her intimately, as Reiko Reiko? What was she like? It's hard to remember, anyway, it was 10 years ago now Not to mention, I was drunk when I got there Do you recall the bar's name? I'm sure it was written in katakana... That's right... Nouveau... It was Nouveau Nouveau? So it was Nouveau The French word for new... Yes I looked for it in Ichinohashi But it folded seven years ago That's the exact time Ikki Hata became Isozaki's secretary So then Reiko took the name Seiga and started divining for politicians Yes There's no doubt Reiko is Seiga Very interesting The truth about this woman is now being uncovered Mr Omoda All you ever talk about is Seiga It's an obsession There's a murderer on the loose! Yoshiko Ikehata entrusted me with this, and I'll solve its mystery... Why is Seiga searching for the man who formed this handprint? I had a palm reader look at it Of these fingerprints only the ring finger has a whorl It indicates power and virtue A man like this knows how to take advantage of current events And he can succeed as a top politician or industrialist I don't have that pattern Neither do I Me neither... We're not fated to be big shots Next, this dual heart line represents strength of will Furthermore The head line runs vigorously towards the wrist, which indicates intelligence In short, this is a man who will stop at nothing in order to reach the top And the mole at the base of the ring finger? I have the same mark Ah, damn it! I forgot to ask about the mole But, who exactly is the man who left that handprint... and how is he related to Seiga? The key to unlocking that mystery lies in Aizu Aizu... in Fukushima? Yes. Tomorrow, I'm heading there to investigate You need to be careful though Seiga killed Yoshiko Ikehata to protect her secret If you make too many ripples you may... You think I'll be killed? My boss was worried too So am I, so why not abandon this trip to Aizu? No, I'm going A reporter will sniff after his prey no matter where it takes him Besides, Sudo here is my deputy Sudo, if I'm killed by Seiga please avenge me! Excuse us Mr Omoda, what's going on with you and Yukiko? You let her see the print Don't worry! Anyway, I'll be heading for Aizu in Fukushima Omiya. This is Omiya Thank you for riding with us Aah, take me to Tokyo Mummy! Mummy! Mummy... Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mr Omoda? It's you... You've been here long? Since evening I guess you had another one of your attacks? Are you okay now? Indeed, the pain has disappeared And my back has recovered Here, eat this Thanks Wearing yourself out from travelling brings it on You won't go to Aizu again, will you? I don't need to go again I've completed my investigation Have you? Yes Finally, I've found out the truth about Seiga The mystery has been resolved Then you know why Seiga was searching for the man who left that handprint? Absolutely And you'll write it up for the Monthly Koron? Yes, I can't allow this woman to wield her influence over Japanese politics I want her charged with murder and jailed It would bring those politicians to their senses They'll lose faith in divination You're pleased? Yes, I'm pleased I want to give a toast Make me a whisky and water Let's both have a drink You can drink so soon after having a turn? Who cares? I've finished a major investigation I want to get drunk with you I see Stay over tonight Fine Once you've published your report, how about we take a trip to an onsen? Somewhere around Hakone or Nikko A quiet inn where we can relax Sounds great, but it would be hard on Sudo He's madly in love with you He's still young though, he'll soon find someone better than me Don't you think you've had enough to drink now? I'm no shrinking violet, but I need to be drunk to be able to say this What is it? Yukiko! I love you You mean more to me than any woman I've ever met To how many women have you said that? You're the first one Really? If so, that makes me happy I'm in love with you, Yukiko Like warm milk... You have a scent like warm milk It smells nice... It smells so nice Mr Omoda! It's Sudo Mr Omoda? It's past noon... Mr Omoda... Sudo What judgement did the police come to? He killed himself by cutting his wrist and taking a big dose of sleeping pills That was the conclusion His chronic illness meant he suffered sudden fits... during which his whole body was in pain He said he wouldn't live long due to lung cancer I suppose those worries got to him... Mr Omoda wouldn't abandon a job when it was only halfway done Suicide is far-fetched He was murdered, like Yoshiko Ikehata Murdered? By that shaman of the political world Seiga? Yes He was taken out because he went to Aizu and uncovered her secret However Yoshiko Ikehata's killing was brutal, while Omoda's death was rather subdued Knocking him out with sleeping pills And gently slitting his wrist That sly method suggests a woman This is Mr Omoda's notebook He would take detailed notes when collecting information But there's nothing about his trip to Aizu I'm sure Seiga removed it all A cunning woman... I'll take over this investigation I'll do all I can to ensnare Seiga, to avenge Mr Omoda What about Eastern News? I'll leave them Mr Kashiwabara Will you employ me as a reporter at the Monthly Koron to replace Mr Omoda? I see no reason not to But you must be ready to face danger You'll be the next person targeted by Seiga I understand I know that only too well Good, then take up the reins Oh, right Here's something Mr Omoda wanted What? We ran a check on the owner of a bar Nouveau of some years ago This contains the various findings Genshichi Furuya... Okay I'll meet with him at once Genshichi Furuya Eh? So Mr Omoda saw you before he travelled to Aizu? Said he'd return but never showed What's up? He died in a incident He died? Yes Ahh... And he was a young'un And what did Mr Omoda ask you about? Asked about my bar, the Nouveau It was something I let my daughter Reiko take care of Your daughter? She was the result of getting one of my fancy women pregnant A very sexy girl, took after her mother And the bar thrived So what is Reiko's whereabouts now? Dunno Seven years ago, she said she was marrying and scarpered She was just like her hostess mother, something of a loose woman I got pissed off and sold the bar But Reiko was a skilled palm reader, wasn't she? Known for her unerring forecasts Not Reiko Mr Omoda said the same It was Maya, a hostess at the Nouveau Maya? Yeah What was she like? A burn had scarred her right cheek, but a really lovely girl Her palm readings were infallible Maya drew in the punters, not Reiko Could Seiga be this woman called Maya? Seiga, what's that? Nothing What became of Maya after the bar was closed down? Said she'd go back to Aizu In Fukushima? Yeah She was an orphan Seems she was brought up in a workshop in Aizu called Yuki Said she was gonna get married Aizu? The Yuki workshop? Yes Mr Omoda... Mr Omoda... Aizu-Wakamatsu Station Do you know a workshop called Yuki? This way please A visitor Something's the matter with Maya? A reporter from Tokyo called the other day He asked a few questions about her I assume it was this gentleman, Koichi Omoda? Yes, that's him Mr Omoda has died in an incident So I would like to hear Maya's story I see Back in 1955, I moved to Tokyo to learn dressmaking I lived in an apartment in Omori Maya lived with her mother in the apartment next door They only had each other as the father had abandoned them Her mother was bedridden, so I would take care of Maya sometimes Maya, listen carefully Your mother's illness is getting worse Next year, you're seven, you'll have primary school You can survive until then If I die, you must search out your father and take revenge You understand, Maya? Mummy! Mummy... And on new year's day, Maya's mother dressed her for her seventh birthday Before killing herself Mummy! Auntie! Auntie... Her mother had slit her wrist and throat with a razor A horrible way to die For a year afterwards, Maya was unable to speak out of shock There was a letter asking me to look after Maya And she had bequeathed a large sum of money So when I finished dressmaking school, I brought Maya back with me to Aizu I took over this place when I married, and I raised the child here But after completing high school, she was resolved to look for her father And she left for Tokyo I wasn't able to stop her going... In search of her father... When she comes face to face with him, she'll surely carry out a dread revenge Day and night, her mother brooded upon the wickedness of her father Are you saying she may be planning to kill him? Yes However, she said she'd return to Aizu once she'd taken her revenge So she must still be searching Mr Sudo Please find Maya's father before she does and tell him of her intentions Did you ask the police to search for Maya? Yes But they think she's a standard runaway They won't search in earnest If we don't do something, then... Okay What's Maya's father's name? Michio Takahashi This is Maya's birth certificate Her mother's called Mayumi It also shows birthplace Is there anything that would aid the search for Michio Takahashi? A photo album the mother owned A wedding photo of Michio and Mayumi was affixed in it And there were handprints Handprints? From the time she was at junior high, Maya read up on palmistry She devoted herself to analysing her father's hand pattern Was Michio Takahashi's handprint the same as this one? I couldn't say for certain, but it looks very similar Where is the photo album? Maya took it with her to Tokyo Do you have any photos of her? Yes. I'll be back in a moment That tool used for cutting cabbage cores is unusual That's a planing rod Planing rod? In the old days, woodworkers used it to finish off making a bowl Hiro-Chan! Lend me that planing rod a moment Okay This tool was used by my grandfather When worn down by repeated sharpening, it can be used as a knife, or to trim small branches, or to pare bamboo It comes in very handy Then it could be used to stab and cut This may be what was used to kill Yoshiko Ikehata... Did Maya take a planing rod to Tokyo with her? Yes She got one from my father Oh, this is a photo of Maya Just before leaving high school... Maya is Yukiko... Yukiko... It can't be There must be a mistake... Good to see you, Mr Hata So Isozaki is the front runner for conservative party leader The event looks a big success I'm surprised to see you at this celebration, Mr Takahashi Given your disdain for politics I didn't come to celebrate I wanted to see you Come We're going to build a hotel in Quebec in Canada I would like your wife's forecast on whether it will be successful or not Seiga's? You consent? I couldn't refuse the renowned hotel magnate, Yoshiya Takahashi Please deliver your handprint to my home address So Seiga can see it right away Thank you Here I want you to look at this print straight away Who does it belong to? That one's Yoshiya Takahashi A wealthy businessman who owns a string of hotels around the world If we could get him indebted to us, election fund raising would be a cinch Yoshiya Takahashi... Who is it? It's me, Reiko The handprint of your father has finally turned up I see... Here This is it This is the handprint of Michio Takahashi, your father Here is a copy This is Yoshiya Takahashi's The names are different, but I think they're identical You're right Identical The same person Maya Maya! You were sure your father would be eminent in business or politics... And you were dead right Your palm readings really are amazing Reiko Turning you into the fortune teller Seiga has paid off At last, Michio Takahashi has landed in the net! He's a well known hotel magnate He wants to know if a hotel project in Canada will pay off... Will you give a forecast as usual? Or will it be as you've always said... I just need a day to think about it Yoshiya Takahashi Still working, dear? Why not take a break? That's not happening You go off to bed You should take your foot off the pedal as you get older With our two children married, we may see our first grandchild soon My job is what keeps me going I'm what I am today thanks to 40 years of devotion to my work I'll work until the end Taito Ward Public Office What's the current address of Michio Takahashi? I need to know... The original family records were destroyed during the war They were reconstructed in 1948, but the name Michio Takahashi isn't there And this old address is now a playground Hmm... That's right There was once a barracks standing here Returnees from China and the south were living here straight after the war Returnees? Yeah Do you know anyone familiar with that period? Yes, there is one guy He now runs a love hotel He used to live in the barracks and look after the returnees Er... His name was Oimatsu Yes, there was a couple by the name of Takahashi Returnees from China I'm looking for a Michio Takahashi, but I haven't a clue where he is Any ideas? You'll be searching in vain His real name isn't Michio Takahashi That's a pseudonym A pseudonym? His real name is Yoshiya Takahashi You know, that hotel magnate or whatever, a super rich bastard! You should know his name at least Yes, I do So he's that Yoshiya Takahashi... That's a turn up But why did he use a false name? He secretly confided the reason to me During the war, in Shanghai, he was a profiteer who used Chinese slaves It seems keeping his real name would've led to his detainment by the Chinese I heard Yoshiya Takahashi abandoned both his wife and a daughter named Maya Is that true? No, it's not A child called Maya was indeed born But she died within three months She died? Yes Then the marriage suddenly turned sour One day, the wife, Mayumi, walked out Maya didn't die She's alive Look, I haven't gone senile yet, y'know Maya died She's dead! Maya How will you deal with Yoshiya Takahashi? No matter what happened in the past, he's still your father, isn't he? If you came together and discussed things... I had just one parent, my mother who killed herself But don't carry out another murder I can't bear it I don't want to do it either I don't want to... But... Her blood... My mother's blood! When I turned seven, my mother killed herself by cutting her wrist and throat My mother's voice has been etched in my mind ever since 'Maya, your father's a cruel, wicked man. He abandoned us.' 'When you're grown up, you must take revenge.' Up until I was six years old, my mother would whisper in my ear, day and night Her words have haunted me ever since At the age of 13, I became a woman And when the blood flowed from my body each month, I could hear that insistent voice 'Maya, why haven't you swiftly dispatched your father to avenge me?' Yoshiya Takahashi must be dealt with... Maya, you've lost your mind! How many people have to die? Yoshiko Ikehata, Koichi Omoda... I don't understand you any more I'll alert the police! Reiko, please don't get in my way If you interfere, I don't know what I'll do... Reiko... Maya! Stop it, Maya! Maya, the pain of being burnt will help you understand my torment I don't want to do this, but I want you to understand my pain Mummy! Maya! In future, this scar will be a reminder when you look in the mirror Of how much hatred I bore towards your father My suffering is far more distressing than the pain of being branded You will hate father too And you will take revenge against him Forgiving him is out of the question, you understand? Mummy! Mummy! I'm sorry, Reiko We were good friends ever since the days of the Nouveau bar But when I hear my mother's voice, I go crazy... and lose control... Forgive me, Reiko... Once I've killed Yoshiya Takahashi, I'll join you in death Forgive me, Reiko Who is it? Sudo of the Monthly Koron I have an urgent need to speak with Mr Takahashi Please let me in I won't leave until I see him Indeed, I used the pseudonym Michio Takahashi I was married to Mayumi, and we had a child named Maya Did the child die, or did she survive? A little while ago... I received a phone call from Maya She said she wants to meet me You'll go? Maya's my daughter I can't refuse When she was a baby, you abandoned her and her mother She may try to kill you in revenge Kill me? Maya? Yes She's already killed two people She's likely to brandish her weapon against you The more reason to see her I just have to talk to Maya Where'll you meet? An apartment Apparently, Maya bought one that was vacant May I come along with you? Maya said she's waiting in the room at the far end of the second floor I'll head in first, you follow behind Maya! It's your father, Yoshiya Takahashi Listen carefully to what I have to say It's not an excuse I just want you to know the truth Okay? I was deployed at a Shanghai munitions factory in the war And when Japan fell to defeat... I barely escaped with my life My name was on a blacklist compiled by Chinese forces Being captured would have led to my execution I took the name Michio Takahashi, a missing Japanese soldier And managed to sneak into the Japanese quarters in Peking However In Peking, lone Japanese men and women were being interred in detention camps They were forced into labour So I entered into a fake marriage with Mayumi I had met her in Peking Eventually, we were able to board a rescue vessel And we landed safely at Sasebo in Kyushu My real wife who I married four months earlier was still in Japan But I didn't know if she was alive Mayumi and I lived in a dormitory for returnees in Tokyo's Taito ward And I kept the name Michio Takahashi In due course, we had a child who we named Maya We were poor, but the days passed happily 'The days passed happily?' Then why did you abandon mother and me? Liar! I'm telling the truth It was the happiest period of my life Stop this charade! Mother brought me up in this apartment when I was a baby She would hug me tight... while repeatedly telling me that father abandoned us That I must learn to hate such a cruel man And... When I reached seven years old She killed herself by slitting her wrist and throat My kimono and futon were drenched with her blood... I see... So that's what happened... She was always saying that I must get revenge when I'm older, that father can't be forgiven Finally, the time has come Wait! If you're so determined to kill him, at least listen to the full story first Do you mean there's more to it? Absolutely The baby Maya who made this handprint died just two months after being born Died? Yes, she died! Mayumi had taken her eyes off her Her face was gnawed by a rat It bit her throat She died Maya... Why did you have to die? Maya... My baby... Wake up! It must be a lie! Her face and throat were bitten by a rat? An obvious fabrication No, it's true That was the state of Japan after it had been defeated Maya was another victim of the war If Maya died, then who exactly am I? Your real name is... Kie Kie? Stop crying When Maya died, I turned to drink while Mayumi cried constantly Around that time, I happened to come across my wife Miyako Miyako Yoshiya! What's so funny? I know perfectly well that you're meeting your previous wife in secret You must prefer Miyako's good cheer to my despondency After that, Mayumi started going crazy Die... Die... Die... Getting cold feet, I went to live with Miyako And the child we had together was named Kie After some thought, I handed over to Mayumi the money I'd earned up until then... and asked that we separate That's fine by me, I'll gladly stay out of your way Miyako and the baby... Kie, isn't it? Make them happy, won't you? Kie, there you go... I'll be back in a moment Maya! Maya! Mummy's here to collect you There, let's go home Mayumi was a terrifying woman She made off with Kie and concealed their location Kie! Kie! Kie! We searched all around Tokyo, but couldn't discover Kie's whereabouts A year later, Miyako died in grief I threw myself into my work to try and forget everything And finally, I married my current wife You understand now? You're Kie, not Maya I am your father, but your mother wasn't Mayumi It was Miyako Your mother was Miyako... You're lying It's all a huge lie! It's true Mayumi abducted you, and hid with you in this apartment And she brought you up with the name Maya Why? To avenge the man who abandoned her She devised a dreadful scheme It was revenge Where is the proof of this? The killer of Yoshiko Ikehata left this handprint on a wall of her flat Of course, you killed her In other words, this is your handprint Your handprint... closely resembles that of your father But Mayumi's handprint is totally different Why? There are three types of fingerprint: whorls, loops and arches For mother and daughter, the chance is 80% of having the same fingerprint And with the heart, head and life lines the probability is higher 90% of daughters take after the mother However, your handprint is completely different from Mayumi's Why? It's because you're not Mayumi's child You're not Maya You're Kie, the daughter of Miyako I recall at the base of the ring finger on her right hand, Kie had a mole What about you? I have it As you see, there's a mole Yes, you're Kie Without doubt If I'm not... If I'm not who I thought I was, what has my life been for? Yukiko, why did you kill Yoshiko Ikehata? She was going to reveal to Mr Omoda that Seiga is a fraud That the palm readings were really provided by me It would have derailed my plan to find father, so I had to kill her! You killed Mr Omoda for the same reason? Yes But weren't you in love with him? Yes, I was... He taught me how to love someone for the first time And he was in love with me Mr Omoda was devoted to his job, but indulgent towards people he loved So for your sake he discarded the facts he'd brought to light, didn't he? Yes, he did Even though he knew all about me, he didn't try to notify the police I really feel sorry for you Well? Will you admit to the police that you killed Yoshiko Ikehata? I can't... I can't do it You're determined to find your father and kill him? What a crazy idea! Well then, how about it? I'm going to die of lung cancer anyway Let's die together by taking these sleeping pills But I couldn't kill myself Seeing he was asleep, I killed him by slitting his wrist... I love you... I love you... Koichi... Koichi! Mr Omoda knew just about everything... I killed him deliberately Besides Mr Omoda, I even killed my friend Reiko who'd stuck by me What have I done with my life? Why did I come into this world? You were taken in by Mayumi's deception Becoming her marionette You were a puppet rather than a human being I was just a puppet... Just a puppet? But don't blame Mayumi She lost her parents in China and only had me to depend on What happened was a result of my abandoning her I'm the one most at fault If you're going to blame anyone, blame me Mother... Is it true? Tell me the truth Mother... It's cold It's cold and dark...
