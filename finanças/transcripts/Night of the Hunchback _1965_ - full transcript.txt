Moon Theatre- Popular Spectacles. Tonight: The Demon's Vengeance starring Bossu You are at my mercy! I beg you to let me go. Free! I'll be gone until tomorrow night. Reflect well. Ouch! My chest! Hurry up! We're going to be late. These men will laugh at us. We're going to play with these high class men. We'll surely pay with our heads. No! They appreciate popular theatre. Come make-up my stomach. So begins- ''The Night of the Hunchback'' After the story from ''A Thousand and one Nights'' Sir, isn't this dance charming? No! Then your servant will entertain you. Enough! Fine! I'll call a dancer who will delight you. Bravo! That was perfect! I told you!! Amazing! Nothing beats popular theatre! Admirable! Oh! My heart! You were very good. The others too. Tired? I thought my heart was going to stop. Relax. I must give you this. What is it? Listen carefully. This note must reach the master's hands. It's a list of our recipients. Hide it. The police cannot know. Be careful. The master's house is being watched. You know the master? Yes, I saw him once. Fine. Pay close attention. This is for the show. Who's there? -It's me. It's not wise to close the door. Come meet the guests. Madame says to treat them well. Yes, yes. If its possible, we'd prefer to take the meals home. We would like to take some home for the children. Yes, they're eating on the grass! Ok, fine. I can't, I'm busy. Okay, but leave the marmite. Now its your turn to play! Thanks...Sorry for disturbing you. You're welcome...a piece of chicken. A piece of chicken and some omelette. Thanks... you're too kind. Come, let's be friends. The bastard. He's the leader! You have to chase him! You start with your little brother? I'm tired of carrying this on my head. But it's nice here. There's vegetables and water. It's tranquil and secluded. Put it down. I'm starving. The casserole, give me some omlette. Casserole, casserole, give me some chicken. Casserole, casserole, give me some chicken. Are you hungry? Then swallow! Looking for me? wait! Open your mouth! Swallow! swallow! Grab his arms and legs. Ah! The elixir of life! What a monkey! Bravo Bossu, excellent! You have played well. You should make movies! Get up! Don't play the fool! You getting up or what? Let's find out, with this! He's pretending! Maybe he has something? What? No, he's joking. It looks like he's fainted. Maybe. He said he had chest pains earlier. His heart has stopped beating! He is cold! Is he breathing? And if he doesn't revive? We'll have to take him to a doctor. Where will we find one at this hour? If we call an officer? And if he's dead? What can we do? Find a doctor. Know one around here? -No, we'll ask. Hide him behind the tree; we'll come back later. He has spoilt our dinner. And if he carried on joking? Joking about his heart? Maybe he isn't dead? Where are we going? Go, walk. If you see someone ask for the address of a doctor. I can't be seen like this. You go ahead: you are a man. Do what I said. All these stupid pleasantries. Go ahead. Excuse me, sir. Do you know a doctor around here? Our child is sick. Your child? That's your child? Yes, we are artists. What's wrong? It could be the milk that's made him ill! Once my child swallowed a grammaphone needle. You can't imagine the state she was in! Do you not know a doctor? Yes, but I was telling you about my daughter... ....with the gramaphone needle. You need to pay attention. But now, it is no longer a gramaphone. Ah yes, the address. First road to the left, then the second... no, its the third... Hold on, I'll go with you. No, don't worry yourself, thanks. First to the left, then the third on your right. Such misery! Look at that! Barber and stylist We can't go in. Go back. This way. Hello Sgt. I'm here by invitation. Come, we're just passing by. We can't just wander around like that! We're lost. Ah! those stupid pleasantries! You virtually held his hand! Lost your tongue? You held him up, didn't you? It's an accident. Yes, but who will believe us? Leave him here. I'll come back later alone. Don't forget the tablecloth! Wait, I think I heard something. No, it's the guest. And the road is noisy! They picked the perfect evening for giving a reception. The boss arrives in half an hour. So, I'm going to shave. Yes. I'm shaving. I don't have much time before the plane leaves. Understand? Tonight... Leaving....For Europe. By plane...Europe...By plane. It's you? Yes, sir. Are you ready? -Yes. boss. Passport? Yes. The ticket? Yes. The suitcase? Leave the door open. I don't want to be waiting in the street. Very well. I'm going to opening the door. The boss mustn't be left waiting. He is irritable. What's that? What does he want? Get up! Get going! This is not the place for sleeping! I clearly did hear something. I'm not deaf. Get up. Is he perhaps drunk? Maybe dead? Why? I'll go call the police. The police? What about my trip? What a mess! Evening, sir. Evening sergeant. I am lost and the boss has surely left! I should not have left him like that. It's you he wanted. I was afraid back there, but we are not the murderers. He may not even be dead. I once heard that an old woman had a heart attack. Six hours later, she was back. What should we do then? -We can't just leave him. But we can't come back here with the police and everyone. And if we go speak to the woman? I'm scared. She will see that it was an accident. Anyway, she's in love with the hunchback. The hunchback? What are you saying? He doesn't move at all. Where is he? -Back there in a street. Wait, I'm coming. Enjoying yourself? Come! Come now! The entertainment! What is going on? They have dumped him in an alley. What can we do about it? You know what he had in his pocket? No. The addresses of smugglers. .. If the police get their hands on it, we are lost. Why do you trust him? Hush! I'm going to do a prank! I must find him. And if he's been searched? I must make sure, it's the least I can do. This is madness. It's that or prison. And our guests? Tell them my mother is ill and I'm going to see her. Be careful. The door must be left open. I was absentminded. If you're like this now, how will you be at customs? I'll pull myself together. Are you ok? Everything ready? Yes, boss. The passport? The ticket? We have an hour and a half before departure. Where is the nougat? What a noise these guests are making! And we can't even close the windows in this heat. Close the fridge. Listen well, my friend. I am the customs officer: ''What is in this box, sir?'' Nougats. I imported them for my uncle in Europe. He likes them a lot. That's fine, but try act more natural. At your arrival, we will make contact and give you the merchandise. Boss! Go to the aerodrome. I'll meet you there. No. You have to say something. Look behind the store. What's there? A man. In the alley there. The door is closed. How did you get in? As usual, it was open! And down there? Like I told you: it's a reception. Fine. Now use your heads and make sure you aren't seen. Make sure you don't speak to anyone. They'll think you did it. Madam, the reception is closed at this time. You must make an a appointment for tomorrow. I doubt there is still anyone here. There is always someone here. They were startled when he wasn't responding. We said that we were sleeping. There is surely nobody here. It isn't important. Hello, darling! Hey, its you! How are you, darling? I was glad that you were also invited. No, I'm not going there. Why? Its no big deal, you know everyone there! Who's there? It's Ahmad, he's invited all the young people. They'll be dancing all night. Come on! Fine, but just give me a moment. Would have been better just to throw him down a well! The road is crowded. Provided we get rid of the body without being spotted. Should we have dumped him at home? -I dunno. He may have died accidentally. He may have starved to death. When are you returning to New York? In a few months. Care to dance? Gladly, but let's go to the terrace, into the fresh air. You must be at the airport for 2:45 am. Does the steward always stay on the other side? Yes. His yard is a good hideout. But how to cross the terrace? Nice weather, isn't it? -A bit cold. Sir, would you like to see an illusionist tour? Coming? Yes. Come on. It's time. Everyone's going down. Catch! Let go! Idiot! Have you left the body up there? They're arriving on the terrace. You must bring it down, or we're finished. A snake. Darling, you have drunk too much tonight. I could have sworn it. You promised not to driink more than five whiskies. Maybe its better that way. The others are coming up. I said that I would put on some cool records. We can't stay here. Get down. Go check if anyone's at the door. We'll put him in the car. Just my luck, as soon as I'm wanting to leave for Europe. I told him that there was someone there. Wait, wait a minute! Didn't you hear a sound? Yes, but we were asleep. Evening, sir. Evening, you're welcome. Some lipstick. A bit of cream. You didn't hear anything either? With all the noise of the party I didn't hear a thing. You're working very late. One should only say that to a lady. Which lady? A woman making an appointment. Tomorrow we're closed. That's why Madame is so late. Then we won't detain you any longer. Good night. What is that boiler? Its an apparatus for the steam that refreshes and regenerates your hair. She is very composed, that woman. We questioned her and she said nothing. She speaks little. In fact, she is mute. Her husband's very lucky. Boss, you are a genius! That's enough. Now, you have to reflect. What are you going to do? Wait a bit. You're having to work tonight. Yes. Tomorrow's a holiday. We have needed a few days rest. You hairdressers are always working. Men also need rest. Good idea. You transporting the mannequins? It needs repairs. Excuse me. What a funny mannequin! Excuse me. Need any help? We will do it ourselves. Pass it to me. No, let us do it. Push it, I'll hold it. It won't work. There's no room. Exit the first and then take that one. Hurry up. If she was honest, I would have danced with the doll. You and your dancing. -Why not? After you. Boss! Boss! Look down there! Stop! Stop! What are you doing? You're insane, you will ruin everything! This isn't for your amusement. Thank you, but you aren't very promiscuous. Hurry, it's getting nasty! Ah, yes! It's well made! We were saying it looks real! The client's leaving? It's a long time. Curious, we didn't see him leave. The heads gone! Idiot, don't you see what you've done? I didn't do it on purpose. So long as its yours. You can't seem to stay calm! Well done, since you wanted to fiddle with it. Anyway, it's worth repairing it here. Go back. Come on, the dinner is ready. I am sure that the client didn't leave. Yes, he was there all the time. We saw him. So, boss, what are we doing? Enough! We said they'd gone for supper. We should try the terrace again. I'm tired of lugging this, idiot! It's too much. I'm not eating tonight. Take some fish, it's delicious. Pass me a fork.... Carefully, carefully. Let go. Speak quickly. Look! To the health of our guests! I'm worried I'll miss the flight. So long as you don't chicken out at customs. No, no, I won't. Relax, we'll get rid of the body. Where have you dumped it? Don't move or I'll talk. The pollce are in the street. Is he in the yard? Your wallet? We didn't get anything. We aren't thieves. Fine, now take me back. To the yard? -Yes, the yard. That's it, everything's clear. I must finish up. Hurry, it's 1 in the morning. Look out for fuses. Switch off the counter. Ah! With all that noise I can't believe people sleep. And I'm nervous about getting married tomorrow. Now's the time. Come on! Go by yourself. Or I'll scream. Go on. Wait! I won't say anything! A tip: the next time you have a spare body... ...don't stash it at our place. Eh! What have you done to our terrace? Sergeant! What is it? Take a look at the hairdressers! Why are they coming here? I agree.... That's right. It all seems fishy to me. Come arrange my daughter's lights. She won't go, you think... It's normal that bride cries at a wedding. Oh, it's not necessary. I cried and so did my mother. I don't remember all this crying. Good. Let's go. At least there's no short circuit. She might set on fire! No, the batteries aren't dangerous. They shine...they turn off. What must I do? Was I wrong to oppose your marriage to that greenhorn? I waited a life-time for a dignified marriage to her. A big reception with music, costumes and lanterns. Must I tickle her to make her laugh? Two months ago she said she doesn't want a big wedding. I was scared of making a mistake. It's these two who put these two-bit ideas into his head. I want his future to be clear. That's all. The husband I picked is a capable man. Not going barefoot like an urchin. Don't say such things, he doesn't done anything. No? He has put you in this state. With his rosewater scented letters and shopgirl literature. Of the type:'' Our hands are empty but our hearts are full...'' but before long the heart's full and the hands empty. Maybe I should thank him again! He might hear you. Let him listen, he is young and this will help him in life. Hurry up! We're running late! Most important that you stay calm. Don't panic. You leaving? We'll do the rest tomorrow. It's the stroll down the road that's soiled you? The client's staying at yours? -What client? Get in. The mute lady. She left some time ago. I didn't see her. Wait a moment, sir. We didn't see anyone leave. Weren't you with her right until the door? No, she left alone. And you? -Me? Could we take a look in your salon? Why? You will see. I want you to complete your work tonight I have a lot to do tomorrow. And me as well. I'm almost finished. A beautiful mess! Such a waste! I will clean it up later. Where is the telephone? Carry on as usual. Do you suspect me? I must be a the airpoirt in half an hour. Just a short interrogation. Turn off the lights! I don't want to be the wife of a fatso. I'd rather die. Darling its too late to cancel the wedding. It's hot! I'll change it tomorrow. This way, this way. Finally! I have my life back! And him, he is catching a flight to Europe. It will be done quickly. It will be too late: I still need to get ticket. Meanwhile, what if we take something? Don't mess about! But no, what about some tidbits? A nougat. Now is not the time. Allow me. It's over. The rest will be for tomorrow. I left the meter closed. Pass the the lamp. Good night. What a mess in here! And no time to take care of it. The sacred mice have eaten everything. At least you haven't died in there. Another mouse! Oh no! It's a burglar! And I've been blaming the mice. Gotcha! How will you escape from that? First, I'm calling the police Shame, it's a hunchback! Maybe I've been too harsh. The light! He had no choice but to steal from me! And then something happened? The police will never believe me! What will become of my daughter's wedding? Such bad luck! Wait! You left here more discretely than how you came in. Help! My daughter's killed herself. Help me! She is dead! Horrible! She is going to die! Where are you? Terrible! She will die! She needs a doctor! Open up! Anyone there? Help me! A doctor! She poisoned herself! We'll take her to the hospital Listen everyone! The neighbour's daughter just committed suicide. Let's go see! Let's go help! Turn on the light. What are these lights? It's my wedding dress. To the hospital. Are you coming? No, my nerves can't bear the hospital. Where is the body? Give me peace! Careful. He has a weak heart! Any contraband? I was forced. -Who? Your silence serves no purpose. And the contraband... The disappearance of a woman This doesn't look good for you. I already told you: I didn't know what was in that suitcase. That's a lie! Then? Now that I've missed the plane, I wanted to say: I know nothing about contraband or murder. Murder? The hunchback who was in our alley Got a light? You don't maybe have a match? You ok? Are you ill? Are you maybe dead? But, you're standing? As if you can reply to me! Ah, the matches. Ah, you don't smoke! Scared of death? Oh good, you've seen it! You've not died of hunger. So, that's a hassle. It would have been nice to talk to you. I'll go then. I'll drink to your health! Ciao! I'll see you at the Final Judgement. You're back! I said to pay your tab. Where'd that come from? The pockets of a dead man. A dead man! My business. A drink! Holy cash! What? You down there? And now that you have money, what are you going to do? I'll buy a fancy car and show it off. And where will you live? Out on the street. Ah! A hobo with a car! Poor people! Look! I have the shoes... ...The pants... The jacket... The gloves... The goggles... And one day I'll have a bike. Scared you, eh? Hey, here's your money. Poor people! Got a cigarette? -Yes, and a light. Can I help you? Can we take a look at your yard? Why? These men claim... ...that they put a body there. For a pickpocket, you're really funny. You surely don't need money. Married? Yes. Is he old? -And jealous. Listen, help me. I'd like one of those papers in your pocket. How did you know? I've seen everything but I know how to do it. That was our gardender. How did he die? His heart. Give me the paper. You will have the money. How much? -Fifty. Everything in there. It's empty. -And? You have it. It's been left on him. -On the corpse? How much will you give me if I go look? I've already paid you. -For something else. Wait! It's not a job for a woman. Wait for me. Give me the paper and you will be well rewarded. You don't have any more money. I'll phone. I'll get it. Who? A friend. Let them come. Come on. That's it. This? Yes, give it to me. How much will you pay? Go phone. The pharmacy is open. Get me the boss. Who is it? A friend. It's you? You found it? Yes. Listen carefully. What? Where? How much? You're crazy! Get the money in the safe. You understand: the safe. Understood. I'm going to bring two men. Repeat the address. That's him. In his right shirt pocket. Look. Tell him to come here. Come get the money. Bring it here. It's too far. Get in the car. Throw me the money. He was there. And now? He had to recover. I'm not moving. Don't shout like that. Get it. In the right-hand pocket. There he is! It's hiim? What is it? Go look. Warn the captain. I'll chase him. What is it? Do you have a phone? Call the police. They're going to kill me. The police station? Wait. Listen carefully... Hold on! Let go. Stop him! Freeze. Hands up. Get that paper. I'd say this was a heart attack. Not voluntary homocide. Let's go. On your way. It's not our fault. It was an accident. Tell that to the judge. The hospital says they have saved your daughter. God be praised. Poor gentleman. Your death was an accident but it could have been helped. Store it with the old accessories. Poor hunchback. Your show has ended.
