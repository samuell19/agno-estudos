God, I hate those stupid jerks and their fucking boarding school. And all their stupid sermons. That fucking slut is going to banish us again. Are you crazy, Zoe? How can you call her that? She-- she's a nun. Watch out! I think the bitch is coming. Ms. Eulalia Esteve, your pathetic limp is no excuse not to be seated. It's god's punishment. All your other teachers have told me that your behavior gets worse every day. Your disobedience and lack of respect are unacceptable. This institution will not allow you to stray beyond the limits. Your parents have entrusted me with... A mission. That's why they brought you from your respective countries to this boarding school. They wanted to keep you away from sin. And I shall fulfill my responsibilities... In spite of you. Joanna, Mary, Christine, Eulalia, Zoe, Susan... All of you young ladies have Christian names-- names of saints and holy women. All of them suffered martyrdom, torture, and pain. They taught us that sacrifice brings us closer to god and to perfection. And keeps us from sin. And worthy of being reunited with the almighty. A love letter! Ms. Mary O'Brien... Don't you know that love can bring about sin? Ms. Mary O'Brien, open your mouth. Open your mouth! Swallow it! Only pain can wash away our sins! Hey, Joel. Aren't you ever going to let go of that goddamn camera? Whoa, hey, I'm the lord of the films. And, uh, this is Julia... The beautiful Spanish girl I'm going on holiday with this summer. Hey, Joel, have you seen Eve? Eve? Oh, come on Artie, just give it up! With all the girls there-- hey, man, you know I like a challenge. She's just got something the others don't. You know what I mean? Do you really think she's still-- well, ask Julia. Or even better, give her the lake test. Hey, lake? Joel, I don't even like water. It's cold. And the water is muddy... Dirty... And there is something moving like snakes. I told you, it never fails. What? I can't go to Spain. All the two of you ever think about is scuba diving, and I'm not into that. I always wanted to see Spain. What are you saying? You always thought Spain was in the south of Mexico. Anyway, my mom is already going to Spain. And her being as she is, the last thing I want to do is go to Europe and bump into her. Hey, you could leave the camera once and for all to dance a little with me, don't you think? Dancing? Or something more? And by the way, I haven't seen Eve for a while. Let's hope she finally-- this is easy to find out. Let's find that girl. She's just turned 18. Let's find out if she finally goes for a swim in the lake. Eve? Eve, is that you? Eve? Is anyone there? Mom? Mom? Get out of here! What did he look like, Eve? It was very dark. Would you recognize him again? Whoever it was was wearing something like a black hood, and... It kind of looked a bit like... Like a... A nun. Your-- your father, where's he? I don't know my father. I see. Would you have any other relatives? Ahem. No. Excuse me. Cut on her throat's clean. There's no doubt it's the cause of death. So far we haven't found any fingerprints except those of the victim. Ok, thanks. I'm here. I'm here. Excuse me, ladies. Look, I promise you you're going to be out of here real soon. Uh, if she is going to stay with you, then we're going to have to have all your personal details. Ok? No problem. Thanks. Well, if you'd like to come with me, I'll get someone to write them down. I'll be right back. Ok? Excuse me, sir? Yeah. Well... Tell me what's the matter. Do you think she committed suicide? What are you talking about? Eve's mother tried to kill herself years ago. My boyfriend told me. They've been friends since they were kids. Eve was only 3 or 4 years old. And she found her mother in the bathtub. To tell you the truth, I think she doesn't remember very well. According to psychologists, she only remembers that her mother was very sick. There was alcohol at the party tonight, wasn't there? Yeah, we all had a few drinks. Well, a lot. What are you thinking? Who knows? Perhaps nobody was there. Perhaps all we have is just a very confused young girl. Mambi! Mambi! Hey, mambi! Zoe. Have you spoken to Cristy? Now? Don't you know what's happened? Cristy called me from New York. She had to meet Mary. 'Cause they were going to come over together. But they didn't get to see each other. Mary's dead, too. We'll wait for you. Have a good flight. Thank you for staying. What are friends for? I have to go back to Spain. I don't want you to stay here all alone. Come with us. Ok. I'll wait for you in the car. You look a lot like your mother. I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances, Eve. I'm Cristy-- Cristy Keen. And I was a friend of your mother's. You knew my mother? We hadn't seen each other for many years. I live on the west coast. But we were going on a trip together the day after tomorrow. She said that was a business trip. We had to meet some old friends from boarding school. The catholic boarding school in Europe? She'd never talk about that. A week ago, Joanna-- another classmate-- also died. In London. The police-- they don't believe me. They say there were no fingerprints. 'Cause... They say that she committed suicide. But... I saw someone. I'll still be in the city tomorrow, Eve. I need to speak to you. "Dear Mary, perhaps it is true that love is impossible." "And for us, even more so. "I love you and always will. Miguel." Miguel? Ok, Eulalia, I'll see you in Barcelona. Take care. Bye. Eulalia? Barcelona. July 10th. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Is anybody there? Help me! There's been an accident! An accident! Eve, come on. This trip is for you to relax and try to forget everything. I have to go to the boarding school archives. Maybe in one of the yearbooks I could find Eulalia's last name, and then I could find her address. But that wasn't the deal. Even the police psychologist said so. You don't believe me, either, do you? The psychologist said... That sometimes... In cases like this, the mind... Plays tricks on us. Cristy did believe me, and she had something very important to tell me. There wasn't a nun in the hotel, either. Yeah, but-- the police told you. It was an accident. Eve, it's all over. Do you think that they'd let you leave if it wasn't? I have to speak to them. That meeting is tomorrow. Right? Yes. Ok. I'll go with you. You'll talk to that woman... And then we'll go to the south, to the beach. I'm dying to get to Seville. I bet you'll love it. And you'll also love my friends, and I'm sure you'll find someone that you'll like better than Harley. That jerk! Eve, wake up! Ladies and gentlemen, we will shortly be arriving in Barcelona. We're in Barcelona. Look how beautiful the city is from up here. Eulalia... Esteven. Esteven. Sorry? I don't speak Spanish. Where you from? New York. Listen, you want to make some photocopies, just go ahead because I still have lots to do. Thanks. Why are you interested in this boarding school? Do you want to study there? Yeah. Well, it says it's been closed since 1988. Do you speak any Spanish at all? No. Well, if you want me to, I can translate it for you. If I have someone's name, can I get hold of their address? Yeah, maybe. There are street guides, information, phone numbers. Would you help me? Yeah, of course I can but... Now I-- I really have to finish this. Ok? When I finish, I can translate everything for you, and we can meet up. What do you say? And what about finding that woman's address? Yeah, well, that's nothing. Suppose we could try. Zoe? In Paris with Susan? Cristy's on her way. She's arriving this afternoon. We want to go there today. We have to go back to that horrible place if we want to know what the hell is going on. Sure. We'll wait for you. Take care of Susan. He's late. How old is he? Is he hot? Look, I just want the translations. I could have translated it for you. So you made me do all this work for nothing? I'm Gabriel. Nice to meet you. I'm Joel. Hey. A beer? Uh, cerveza? Oh, no. Thanks. I don't drink. Eve told us you're studying history, right? Well, yes, it's part of my seminary studies. Seminary? You mean you... You want to become a priest? Yeah. You're joking, aren't you? No. So, have you already taken the vow of chastity? Joel, stop it! That's why you like him, isn't it? With him, you feel safe. She knows-- shut the fuck up! Eve, I think it might be better if I leave. It's been a pleasure. I'm sorry! A priest-- that's funny! Wait! Um, I'm really sorry. Joel didn't mean-- you're so stupid. Materialism and spirituality... Each one chooses according to his beliefs. Why didn't you tell me before? You know... Not long ago, i-- I wasn't so different from your friend Joel. I thought the most important thing in life... Was to have a good time. Parties, alcohol... And fun. Until my girlfriend... Got killed on a motorcycle accident. I was driving. That night I hadn't drunk anything, but nobody believed me. And I couldn't stand it. Thank you. Yes. How come you're interested in this religious school? My mom studied there. Well, there's no match. Here it says it's been closed since 1988. Sister Ursula... Sister Ursula. The principal-- disappeared one night, same year. So they assumed she fled. Did you get that lady's address? This is her last known address. Mambi? Mambi? Let's go. Where's Eve? I don't know. She told me she had to leave. Shit. She shouldn't have gone alone. Why? Hasn't she told you? No. What? Well... I guess it would have been a bit embarrassing for her to tell a priest that... A nun killed her mother. Hey, what are you talking about? Do you know where she went? Yeah, I think so. Ok, let's go. Mambi. Mambi? Mambi? Mambi. Mambi. Eulalia? I-- I'm Eve, Mary's daughter. May I come in? Eulalia? My god. Gabriel! What happened? Please, guys, don't look. Please. We have to call the police. Now! Eulalia, this is Zoe. Are you there? We were delayed, so we'll be there later. Susan's been hysterical ever since I told her about Mary. Eulalia, if you are there, please pick up. Susan wants to call the police, but we can't. We can't call the police and you know it. Eulalia, Cristy-- this is a fucking nightmare. Where are you guys? Well, you're probably gone by now. Anyway, we'll rent the car and go right to that place. I also think the answers we are looking for are back where it all began. It's gotta be right here somewhere. You know we should've never come. We should've just called the cops. Listen, maybe Joel's right. Maybe we acted too hastily. Eve! We all heard the answering machine. We have to tell them what happened to Cristy and Eulalia. They are in danger. Eve, time out for a second. Now, we left the scene of a crime. Now, that is a crime in itself! God damn it, Joel! I told you before, if that's the way you feel, you get out of the car and call the cops. Joel! Joel, don't be stupid! Eve... We're all nervous. But let's try to be reasonable, ok? You know what it's like when no one believes you, right? You've been there, too. I just want to find out what happened to my mother. I'm sorry, baby. Come on, guys, you can't stay out here. Look, what does it say there? It says they're building some kind of thermal bathing spa. There's a turn back there. We missed it. From now on, I'm driving. Joel, slow down. Please. I just want to get the fuck there already. Jesus. You could have killed us! Well, what's this... Fucking car doing in the middle of the road? Damn it! Shit. There's no coverage. Can you start it? There's nobody inside the car. It's got to be theirs. Ok, but it's still hot. It won't start. Look, footprints. It's them. Look! Let's go! Come on! Come on. Let's go! Come on! Fine, fine! Look, guys. The door's been forced open. Oh, shit. You should have taken the scuba flashlights with us. They're in the car. Susan? Zoe? What the hell was that? I'll have a look. Welcome... To the nun witch project. Oh, shit! What was it? Birds. A dirty bathroom full of birds. They must have flown in through the broken windows. Susan! Zoe! Hello? Zoe? Susan? Oh, yeah. This really is some place. This is exactly where I want to spend my vacation. Stop filming. I don't like this place. I'll just... There they are. Sorry. And Eve? I don't know. We lost her. Eve! She's not here. Can't you see it? She's not! And Eulalia. Where are Cristy and Eulalia, for god's sake? Susan, calm down. Hello? Who are you? I'm Eve. Mary O'Brien's daughter. What is she doing here? Eve... I'm Zoe. And this is-- Susan. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Eulalia told us about your mother. Eulalia and Cristy are dead as well. Oh, god's punishing us. But when? Listen, we've-- we have to get out of here and call the police. We can't waste any more time. Please, let us get out of here-- Susan, we can't call the police. We didn't do it then, and we won't do it now, understand? Do you understand? Did you call them? No. Why can't we call the police? I know who killed my mother. It was her, the nun, sister Ursula. I saw her. I've seen her with my own eyes. I saw her! No, i-- i... I don't believe you. That can't be true. Can it, Zoe? Why? Go on, tell her! Tell her! It can't be her. Shut up. It can't be sister Ursula. That's impossible. Why is that impossible? Because... She's dead... Dead. There you are! What are you up to now? Are you crazy?! Why is it that you always do the wrong thing? Why is it that you're always complaining about everything? Where's Mary? Why isn't she with you? She's not in her room. Stop! Stop! Stop! It's coming from the downstairs bathroom. That's Mary's voice. What are you doing?! Purifying her! Purifying. She's going to kill her! Stop it! You fucking bitch! Leave her alone! Get away! Susan! Help her! Help me! Oh, my god. Stop, don't kill her! This pond... It's supposed to be holy water, remember? The nuns from the convent purify themselves here. Shit. It's just a normal fucking pond. We've got to swear that we never, ever tell anyone what we've done or what happened here tonight. Susan. Hail Mary, full of grace... This is crazy. It's fucking crazy! Take it easy, Joel. Come on. And what do you expect me to do after what I've just heard? Look, we should just go to the nearest town and call the cops. The nearest town is 10 miles away, remember? And we shouldn't leave them hanging here alone. I'm afraid we're the ones who are gonna be hung for being here. It can't be true. My mother never hurt anyone. Why would sister Ursula want to kill my mother? Why? Because she was-- she was crazy. She said that her mission was to end with all the sin in the world through punishment and pain. Maybe she didn't die, and now she's come back to seek her revenge. But why now, after 18 years? Why did she wait so long? The pond water... They used to say it was... Holy water. Can't you see? The people from the thermal bathing spa dried out the pond 2 weeks ago. They told us that in town. You told me Joanna died exactly 2 weeks ago. When the pond water disappeared, her spirit was set free. It won't rest in peace until she's completed her mission, remember? Come on, Susan, stop! Shut up! Ok? Ok? So, let me get this straight, are you trying to tell me that all this is some sort of... "I know what you did 18 summers ago," or something? Oh, shit. I don't know what's going on. But we have to find out. Well, we've got all night. The 2 cars are still fucked, and with this rain, it's better not to try and go outside. She'll never let us out of here. We'll pay for our sins. And you, too! This is just... Superstitions. I don't think so, Joel. Sometimes there are things that have no explanation. Everything has an explanation. It's just a case of finding it. Where's her room? Upstairs. The staircase at the end of the corridor. She's here. I know she's here. Wait. I'll go with you. Here. You'll need this. Th-- there was an electricity meter in the room near the entrance. Let's go. I'm really happy you came with us. I know how important it is to feel like somebody believes you. With you I feel-- safe? Is that what you were gonna say? Oh, no. That's not... That's not it. Since you told me about the accident... I feel like I've known you for a long time. You know, in a certain way, both of us feel responsible for what's happened to us. Do you know, I didn't always get along with my mother. There were so many questions I had to ask her. It was something that-- I know. What? Joanna told me about your mother in the park. This is crazy. Absolutely fucking crazy. Something happened to my mother. Something... Like an accident or something. I was really young, and my memory somehow erased everything. If you can't remember... It must be for a good reason. Try not to torture yourself. Ok. Those women are nuts. And Eve... It's like... She didn't have enough as it is. No, on top of that, she believes what that priest says. Joel, we have to help her. She's having a hard time. Know what I think? I think Eve is finally gonna go for a swim in the lake. What does that fucking test mean anyway? Uh, according to Harley... Good lake, good sex. Bad lake... Stupid boys. "To sister Ursula from father Miguel." Miguel... Hey, what's wrong? I think I, uh... What are you talking about? The dog. Dead woman's dog. I liked it, and we shouldn't have just left it behind. Look, we have more important things to do. And then there was light! Hey... That should hold up without blowing out. I'm just nervous. Don't worry. I know you by now. Remembering what we used to call it? Yeah. Susan's inquisitor. Not here. Ok? Not in the room of the monster that killed my mother. You saw what she did to Eulalia. What did you say? Gabriel, it's not that I don't want-- Eulalia... Why didn't I think of that before? Come with me! No, no, no. Wait here. I'll be back in a minute. I'll go check something. But what-- wait. You stupid brat! Keep out of my things! Miguel? Where are you? At the airport? You're not? Mommy! What's wrong, mom? Mom! Eve, I've just discovered how-- hey... What happened? Are you all right? I just remembered something. My-- my mother... When I was a little girl... We're going to pay for what we did. And Eve, too. You know that, don't you? What are you talking about? Come on, you know what I'm talking about. When I saw her with that young man... With a priest... It's history repeating itself. It's all over, now. It's all right. Everything's gonna be fine. Listen, Eve... I've discovered how she's doing it. What? It was right under our noses, and I didn't realize it until now. Come with me. We-- we can't let her do it. We have to tell her! We swore to Mary we'd never tell. Where's Eve? She's not back yet. I don't know what she thinks she'll find, except for rats and bird shit. You guys! You have to come and see what Gabriel found in the corridor. Come on. Follow me. St. Eulalia. Crucified. St. Joanna. Burnt at the stake. She's giving them the same death as their patron saints. St. Mary. Her throat cut. Saint Christine. Her arms cut off. I forgot about these paintings, I... Oh, Jesus! Crazy motherfucker! Now we know what the old bitch is doing! In her way, she's trying to purify her guilt. Punishment and penitence. Pain and sacrifice to gain god's forgiveness. Saint Zoe, burnt in an oven. Bullshit! Fucking bitch! Listen up, you whore! You hear me? You hear me? I already killed you once, and I'll do it again! The only one that's facing punishment and penitence is you! Can you hear me, bitch? You're dead! Dead! I killed you! Saint Ursula. An arrow thrown through her heart. That's what you want. Then that's what you'll get. Zoe, where are you going? Zoe, Zoe, where are you going? Zoe! Susan, come on! God... I don't want to die. Not like that. Please. Not like that. Susan, just try and calm down. Everything will be ok. We're gonna help help you. That's why we came. Just try and calm down. Nothing will be ok. We're condemned. And you more than anyone else. Susan. You're responsible for all of this. You! You are the sin! Go away. Go away. Get away from me! What the hell are you talking about? Susan! For god's sake, calm down! Go away! Susan! Leave me alone! I don't understand, Susan. Just leave me alone. Leave me alone. She's here. I know she's here! Oh! Oh! No! No! Susan! Susan! Please open this door! She's come to punish us. Zoe. What are you doing with that? I'm going to give her a taste of her own medicine. I'll kill her the same way St. Ursula died. Maybe she'll leave us in peace. I'm not about to sit here and wait for her to come. Wait. What about Eve and Susan? I thought they were on their way. I'll go with her. You go and look for the others, ok? Ok. Come on. Let's go find them. Hail Mary, full of grace. The lord is with thee. Please open the door! Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Hail Mary, full of grace. The lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary, full of grace. The lord is with you. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Hail Mary, full of grace. The lord is with you. Blessed art thou-- oh! Susan! Susan, talk to me! Susan! Let me help you. She locked the door, and she wouldn't let me in. It's horrible. I saw-- I saw her... There she is again. There she is! Where is she? She was right there in front of you. You sure you saw her? I didn't see anything. She was right there. It's only water, Eve. You didn't see her? I believe you. Maybe you can see her, but the rest can't. Wh-what are you talking about? Why? For the same reason Susan blamed you before she died. What do you mean? You were there with us, too. What are you doing, miss O'Brien? Nothing. Evil whore. You've sinned. Now you carry sin deep within you. No! Please! Stop crying, you stupid child. I'm going to cleanse you. No! No! Him? Who was my father? Tell me! Your mother made us swear that we would-- my mother is dead. She's dead. Who was he? You cannot stand these confessions. For it was a priest. Father Miguel. Miguel? A priest? And sister Ursula knew? She won't rest until she's killed everyone who was here that night. What can we do? The spear didn't work. You can't kill a ghost with a spear. If that thing was a ghost. Dust you are... And to dust you shall return. Sister Ursula died in the water. Eve says there's always water. She appears, always, through water. She needs water to exist. To take on a physical form. If she can kill in the water, in the water, she can die. What do you mean? That if we manage to make that thing appear in the water, we could shoot it? Under the water, we have a chance. We have to take her to a place that we can flood. In the water, she'll become flesh and blood. Where? I know. I have no intention of being buried today. Do you hear me? Fucking slut! The main faucet must be closed. There were some water tanks on the top floor. I'll try to open them. Be careful. I'm coming with you. Let's plug the drains. With what? With these? We need more. In the kitchen, there must be some more rags. I'll go get them. Wait. Don't go alone. No, no, no. I'll go with you. Julia, she won't hurt you. Ok. These must be the main water tanks. Let's open all the faucets. Come on. What are we doing up here? This is a waste of time. And I know you don't believe any of this ghost crap, either. You and Eve-- you don't understand anything, Joel. They made it. We have to go. She's by herself. It won't fucking close! Gabriel? And Zoe? Right behind me. Come on. We have to plug all the drains. Yes. Here. Gabriel, can you hear me? I'm getting nervous. Where are they? What the fuck was that? The electricity's been wet. Looks like Joel messed it up. Zoe's taking too long. I'd better go find her. No, no. I know you are the only one who can see her if she comes. Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Joel. Joel! No. No. We can't do anything for her anymore. At last! Joel fixed it. Shit. The water is higher now. If the water touches the lamp, we'll be electrocuted. The drain-- I'm draining the water. Get out of the water. No. If she attacks me out of the water, I won't be able to do anything. This is the only chance. You go and turn off the electricity, ok? Ok. Turn it off. Joel! Gabriel! Eve? Eve? Eve? I knew you could do it. You ok? Now what? She's coming. But she's coming for me. Julia, you're gonna have to leave now. I'm gonna be ok. Good luck. Are you ok? Yes. Yes! It's you. Gabriel's gone. There has been an accident. And Zoe is dead, too! Listen. I think I have an explanation for all this. No, no. It's not the time. Eve is in danger. No. It's not Eve that is in danger. Julia, please. Just sit down for a moment. Were you there when Zoe died? No. She went with Eve and-- and never came back. Just like Susan. And... Cristy. Eulalia. And Mary. You stupid brat! Keep out of my things. These are mine. Do you hear me? Mine! Miguel? When I was alone with Gabriel, he told me something. Where are you? At the airport? Eve started to remember things from when she was a little girl. Ok. Eve's mother tried to commit suicide. And? Eve told Gabriel that her mother tried to kill herself because she couldn't cope with the murder she committed 18 years ago. Here, in this place. I killed her because I fucked you! Do you understand? Eve knew all along that her mother had killed a nun. What's wrong, mom? The only explanation I can come up with... Is that Eve's brain... Must have... Blocked out that part of her memory. Mom! Mom, wake up! And now... Something must have brought it back. What the hell do you mean? Ok. We both know that Eve was the only person present at the scene of the crimes. Yeah, and? She's the only one who could have done it. Leave me alone. You're responsible for all this. Susan! Somehow, the nun lived through Eve, possessed her like some curse. Eve! This is the truth about the nun. Eve and the nun are the same person.
