I want to see the look in Jacques' eyes when I pull the trigger. [giggles] Yes, Daddy. [giggling] Damn it! Hey, angel! You said you're always helping me. Fuck I am supposed to do? (Laila) Gas. (woman) Jacques, use the soldier's book. Mary, get the book! [gunshots] [screaming] What am I looking for? Anything about traveling or cars. (Mary) This isn't an Oldsmobile manual, all right? (Jacques) Okay. How to travel in time or in space. God damn it! [gasping] [spits] [angrily] Sit there. Jacques, do something, please. [garbled voices on radio] [organ music grinds down] Yes, that's what we did. Mary, sing with me. Close your eyes, and block everything out. Just listen to the tune. I hate this song. It's stupid. Do it! Do it! Just do it, okay? Deep and slow. [groans] ♪ Should have married me. Okay. Keep concentrating on the rhythm, just the rhythm. ♪ [woman on radio] ♪ You used to run away when you saw a road-- ♪ Right, what, hold on. ♪ Instead, you should've married me. ♪ ♪ Instead, you should've married me. ♪ ♪ ♪ Instead of Elaine. ♪ ♪ Instead of Elaine. ♪ [Mary groans] Jacques. Mary, is the baby okay? Yeah. The book's gone. But... I guess the book worked. It's a strange place to end up. It's underground. Huh? It's my parents' weird apartment building. I just--I don't see their Volvo. [chuckles] That is the smell of turkey. Turkey never smelled better. Oh, it's a note from my brother. It says, um, that they're at midnight mass and to forget about getting the cranberry sauce. They'll just go to the store after church. No cranberry, I like this kind of problem. So no key? I have a plan. [doorbell rings] Feliz Navidad, Mrs. Martinez. Oh, so good to see you. Uh, this is my friend Jacques. Do you still have my parents' key by any chance? (Mary) Gracias. Et voilà. This is it. [laughs] Cute. You rest, and I'll wash up, okay? Okay. I'll just watch your tree grow. That's my favorite activity. [whispering] Jacques, I love you. [glass shattering] Mary? [cocks gun] Mary? [door rattles] Shit. What the fuck are you doing here? Hi, I'm Jacques. You're a jock? No, I'm Jacques, French. I'm French, Mary's boyfriend-- I mean, husband, but we are not married yet and-- these Volvo keys? [tires squealing] Cordobes! Let her go! This is between you and me. Bastard. [gunshot] [Jacques groans] [Mary whimpering] Jacques. [electronic whirring] [gunshot] [Mary screams] Jacques? [Mary crying] (Jacques) Mary, get away! (Mary) I can't! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (Laila) Shoot her. Now. [growling] [calliope music] God damn you! It's her... No! Or me. [Cordobes grunting] No! [gunshot] (Mary) No! Jacques. Son of a bitch! Kill the baby. ♪ [shouting] Who are you? Oh! Careful. No, Daddy, it's me. Your little girl. Shut the door! (Laila) Daddy. You meant the world to me, Daddy. You meant the world to me, Daddy. [Mary groaning loudly] Jacques, don't leave me! Don't leave me! Somebody help me. [Mary sobbing] Somebody, please-- [gunshot] [gunshots] Why'd you want this? No wife. No daughter. No peace. Go to Mary. She needs you, Jacques. Where were you? Helping me? You're alive. What about him? Like the Romans said, "At the center of all things, there are tears." Demasiado corazón. Too much heart. Or hate. Too much hate. I keep reaching, but I can't touch him. I can't. Allison. Yes. Don't leave me. No, my love. Your love? My husband. [sizzling noise] Go. We must go and save Laila. [baby cooing] Come and say hello. She won't bite. It's a she? Why not? Uh, I just thought, uh-- okay. Hello. Hello. What should I call her? Her Majesty? [snickering] I call her "pumpkin." Pumpkin? Mm-hmm. Oh, so, Pumpkins, you are not a dream, huh? [baby crying] Now the real trouble begins. [both chuckle] Pumpkins.
