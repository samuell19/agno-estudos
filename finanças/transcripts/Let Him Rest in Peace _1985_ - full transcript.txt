LET HIM REST IN PEACE Which way is Freein? How much is it? How much?

Hi! I want to go to Freein. Which way is it? Why go there? To stay as a guest. You shouldn’t go. That place is no good. Here. Isn't it your turn? I just went. It's your turn! - Hurry up and put something out. - I just put something down. Show it. Cut it out, idiot. So here. - Next is my turn. - Is that how you're going to play? I'm being nice. - Here. - What is that? What is it? Are you open? I suppose. I see. Who are you? Shimoyama sent you, no? What is it this time? Can’t I just be a guest? Guest? For real? How much for a night? - Are you with someone else? - None. We have no single beds. The rooms are messy. Yeah, but you at least have a bed, right? Of course, don’t treat me like an idiot. Do business properly, Komiya. - Where’s Ryuta? - Dunno. Oba! You go over there. Women use the area, so don’t wander about. To the side! Your occupation? None. Give me that. Hey, are you listening? It’s okay if you aren’t, but... Hey, Rumi. Things are the same here. Nothing changes whether you break our cheap windows or kill our dog. When Takahata comes back, tell him to hire someone more high class. It’s useless whatever you do! I wonder if there’s such a thing as a high class yakuza. - Mama, did you go to the police? - It’s the same thing. - The president won’t see you? - He doesn’t want any gifts. Yutaka, how was it? What is up with that guy? Perhaps he’s gay. Maybe you’ll get lucky. Stop it. He doesn’t seem to be anyone special, but there’s something strange about him. Sakaguchi! You don’t look it, but you are Japan’s craziest kid! One, two, die! - Hurry up and get out of the town! - Your dad should get the death penalty! Let me do it with the women at your place. You don’t look it, but you are Japan’s craziest kid! You don’t look it, but you are Japan’s craziest kid! You don’t look it... Are you eating? I’d die if I didn’t. The mother is gone and the dad is in here. What can you do, huh? I'm Tokuda. Are you the one that brought a gift for Sakaguchi? Don’t tell me that’s it. I thought he’d be lacking vitamins from eating stinking meals in here. Takeshi Shindo. You came far. Did Sakaguchi send for you? No. I read it in the paper, so I’m just here to sightsee. You didn’t enter your occupation. I can give him a gift even if I’m unemployed, right? Unemployed? What is your relationship with Sakaguchi? We were pals. Did you do PE together? PE? Ah yes, you’ve got great instincts. Don’t underestimate me because I’m a country police officer. I won’t accept a gift from some unknown stranger. Then, I’ll make it from his son. Go fill it in. How is Sakaguchi? Ryuichi Sakaguchi is a criminal! Why would I want him to be okay? He should consider what he’s done. - When is he being released? - I don’t know. It’s been 5 days. I can’t get any answers from him. He won’t say anything. It’s not a big deal, is it? He just had a knife and no one got hurt. It’s been a great shock to the people at Shimoyama Construction Company. Shimoyama Construction Company is trying to save this town. Even in its run down state, they want to buy our property. They are the savior of this town. They’re even taking care of where they go next. There’s no other company that’s so giving. In order to have the employees of a company like that work safely here, I can’t have a wild man like Sakaguchi running about. A wild man, huh? To put it another way, he’s an extremely peculiar man. For no apparent reason, he’s the only one against Shimoyama’s plans. Everyone else is extremely inconvenienced by his actions. Why are you so protective of Shimoyama Construction Company anyway? Go home! Your dad and I went to college together. Our majors were different, but we practiced Kendo together. After practice, we would share a lemon like this. We also chased after women together. Your dad and I are completely different. Our personalities are different too. But the women we would fall for were the same. Aren’t you eating the lemon? I don’t like lemons. {\i1\pos(1257.931,144)}Shimoyama Construction Company You know. I’m going to go see the man that your dad raised his knife to. His name is Takahata. How about it? Do you want to come? I'm going home. What can I do for you? I’m here to see Mr. Takahata. - And who may you be? - I work for Tokuda. I’m sorry, I had no idea. He is currently in a meeting with Pr. Shimoyama, but I’ll see if he can see you now. It’s all right, I’ll wait. There’s no time. Understand? Please hurry. As you know, there hasn’t been a time when things didn’t go as I planned. I won’t accept any exceptions. Even if the measures are somewhat brutal, we cannot afford any more delays. In every aspect, perfection is key. Clear all obstacles with precision and without issues. Thank you. That's it. Sir. There’s a man here who works for Mr. Tokuda. He’s a man that’s been helpful to us. Is that so? I am Shimoyama. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Should I see you out? - Call Mr. Tokuda. - What? - I said call Mr. Tokuda! - Yes, sir! Never mind. I just saw him for the first time minutes ago. He was playing with that lighter that’s too expensive for his taste. Go away! Why does a clean company like Shimoyama own a dog? You throw rocks into Sakaguchi’s motel, you kill Ryuta’s dog, exactly what part of the company is clean? Who are you? I’m an outsider, just like your company. I remember now. I knew I’d seen your face before. You were a boxer at Keio. That's right. You got into a fight about some nonsense with some gang members and you disappeared. That was a long time ago. It doesn’t matter if it was a long time ago. The facts never change. You’re not the type of man who would be frightened by something like Sakaguchi holding a knife. “Overcome with fear, Mr. Takahata asked for the help of Detective Tokuda who happened to be waking by.” Idiot. Sakaguchi is not the type of man who would frighten another man, no matter what. And he stuck a knife at you? You forced him to hold the knife, didn’t you? You framed him, didn’t you? With Tokuda. You’re slightly off. Why do you need to have Sakaguchi in jail? No matter where you put him, if he doesn’t sign the papers, the rights to the property won’t be yours. Can you give me a light? Answer me. Mr. Sakaguchi is great because he doesn’t say anything. I’m just trying to do the same as him. How much is it? 1,000 yen. Thanks for the meal, here’s 1,050 yen. Thank you. Refrain from coming here anymore. I don’t even want to give a glass of water to a Freein guest. - Do you have something against Sakaguchi? - He’s a problem. Mr. Shimoyama will take good care of us. We thought about what we should do, and finally decided to sell. But Sakaguchi is holding up the negotiation, so that he can sell his property for a lot more. Who said that? Why else would he be so stubborn? We’re all in the same boat, but he’s only got that run down hotel of his that’s about to go out of business. Maybe the problem isn’t with money. It’s money! Money! Money! The guys from Shimoyama said so. It's certain! What? You actually believe in a company that spreads rumors like that? Of course we believe them. The property around here are worth only 5,000 yen per 3.3m2. But they purchased it for 10,000 yen. - 10,000 yen, 10,000 yen! - The rest of us are on the same page. There’s no one on Sakaguchi’s side. But because they won’t raise their price, he went mad and flung a knife around. He’s an embarrassment! I'm starving! Here. Eat properly, come on. - Bon appetit. - Welcome back! You should have told us from the beginning. Ryuta told us. How about you join us? That’s where the president usually sits. No! Why not? For a change. He’s a special guest, right? Wow, Komiya, you sound like you’re in charge. Not that I care, but I guess you’re calling the shots. No, that’s not my intention. Hey, when you have time, come help me. Perhaps he's into men, after all. Maybe he'll like it. Come in. You can take a bath now. It’s on the first floor. The bed is lopsided. Huh, are you sure? Get on. Okay. So, it looks like Sakaguchi really did use a knife. It’s hard to believe, but it sounds like it. I need something to put in between. - This would do, no? - Yes. Shimoyama’s been hassling us for about a year now. They’re in on it with the cops and the yakuza. At first, everyone was against them. But they all got threatened, and now, they’re all in agreement. Before, about 10 girls used to live here, but half of them ran away. And the president just lost it, I guess. But Sakaguchi wouldn’t bring out a knife for something like that. - Wasn’t there something else that was worse? - That’s what I can’t figure out. Welcome. Sakaguchi came here often? Give me the same. Straight. Can you get the girls something too? Welcome. You need to pay up front. Please, make a note of it. Thank you very much. Mama, 6000 in change. - Cheers! - Thank you! You too. Thank you. - Is it always like this? - Yes, it is. The rest of the town is against Sakaguchi. Yes, that's right. Have you told them not to talk to me? They’re all nervous after what Ryuta told us. They’re thinking a friend of the president must be a man of few words and scary as well. Is Sakaguchi scary? Everyone who doesn’t talk much is scary to them. Being bound to that hotel is far scarier. No way it is. The only thing that scares us are those that don’t reveal what they’re thinking. But the president is nice, yes, he is. I’m the same. Right? You came from Tokyo, right? I’m from Yokohama. I’m here for various reasons. You have the smell of... ...the city! Your nose looks like the president’s. Right, Mama? Look! Do you want to go home? Hey, can I have some more? People from the city don’t like it when you’re too pushy. It doesn’t matter where you’re from. A nice person is a nice person, right? Well, a nice person doesn’t mean that he’s rich, right? Were you born in Tokyo too? You are, right? I can tell. Oh, thank you. Cheers! I’m so happy. Thank you! A cool man from Tokyo, huh? We won't do anything. We were told to just keep an eye on you. Hey. Just get the hell out of here before you regret it. I don’t like to be told what to do! Sakaguchi said the same thing to... ...President Shimoyama. That’s no surprise. There’s a reason for what he did. It won’t end well. Sakaguchi is an idiot. - You should be careful too. - There will be casualties... ...on your side. Don't be stubborn. For people like us, it’s best to do as you’re told. Hey! It’s the end of the world if gang members are preaching to people. Idiots. No, stop! Mr. Ishii! Mr. Ishii! Go back and tell Takahata. I told him not to set me on fire. Are you all right? Mr. Ishii! We can’t have it turn into a big deal! Mr. Ishii! Ryuta. Ryuta! What happened a week ago? I was taken. To a warehouse They told me to call my dad. Why? They told me to think about it myself. And what did you say? That they might actually kill me. I was scared. That's it? What did Sakaguchi say to you? He didn't say anything. Nothing? And then? I don’t know why, but they let me go. They let you go? They said if my dad didn’t sign, they would take me on a field trip every day. Did Sakaguchi report it to the police? It wasn’t kidnapping. It was a field trip. They lured me with lemonade and cookies. When I told them I don’t like lemon, they poured it over my head. Did you tell your dad when you got home? Didn’t you say something? I told him we should get out of here. He knows full well that in the end he can’t win, but he's so stubborn. He's so stupid. And that night, he made a fool of himself by flinging around a knife. Everyone made fun of me at school. Ryuta, what is it? You’ve never been in a fight? What’s the point if you know you’re going to lose? It’s so stupid, but it can’t be helped. Strong ones are always strong. You make me cry. Do you know why Sakaguchi was flinging a knife around? He doesn’t tell me much. You must have heard from Ryuta. It was hard to put him to sleep just now. I told you. Yakuza are involved. I can’t turn back at this point. You’re a real simpleton. Nothing is going to happen if we don’t do anything. We have to make the next move. You don’t need to make a move. We need to stay still. That won’t get Sakaguchi out of jail. I will wait. There's no time. - I’m home. - Welcome home. I’m completely wet. They all have to work elsewhere to make a living. Ah, disgusting. Oh, a city man gets his business done quickly, huh? The customer insisted on using my mouth because I wasn’t wet enough. Three times. My neck is going to be sore. - Did he pay you for three times worth? - No. I gave one for free. How about the other girls? Are they back? - You’re the last one. - Oh, really? I have to go to bed. My older kid is taking lunch to kindergarten tomorrow. I have to get up at 7 a.m. I’m going to die. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Good night. I finally have a life. This kind of proper lifestyle, it’s the first time for me. So, I’m feeling a bit tipsy. Good night. Good night. What is it? You should be downstairs. I need to see Detective Tokuda. Mr. Tokuda, you have a guest. Did Sakaguchi say he’d sign?! You can torture him all you want since he’s locked up now! Sakaguchi would never sign! That’s the kind of man he is! - You know that already. - Hey! Stop this nonsense and let him out! What the hell are you talking about? I’ll inform your boss or whomever. I’ll leak that you’re getting dirty money from Shimoyama. When that happens, it’s goodbye. Wait, let’s talk. Proof. Do you have proof? I do. Then, show it to me. You just proved that there’s proof. You bastard! We’ll be having fun from here. What can you do? Are you afraid? If you are feeling scared, then you should be thinking of how to get Shimoyama. You’ll feel better that way. I have a few tricks up my sleeves. Mr. Tokuda. You’re actually a very honest man. Don’t think we’re the same. You’re the first to harass the police. You’re the type I detest the most. Why don’t you have the police or your guard dogs here? That's right. Takahata mentioned you. I’ll tell the papers about what you’re doing. About Sakaguchi’s case Really? How you kidnapped his kid, how you hire yakuza, how you have a police officer working for you, there’s plenty. Is that so? Mr. Shimoyama. You can get Sakaguchi out, right? Did you come all this way just for that? Was it raining in the south? Maybe it’ll rain here tomorrow. He’s afraid he’ll be kidnapped again. He won’t go to school. Ryuta, you like this place, right? You want to stay here, right? However, you were threatened and scared, so you told your dad to get out of here. Ryuta! Is Mr. Shinoda staying here? Yes, he is. But they keep on escalating and... So what? Of course, I want to stay here with everybody. I see. There’s one way to make that happen. We go to the police, and then you tell them that you were kidnapped. If I did such a thing, they’ll really kill me. We can also get Sakaguchi out. It’s no use. The police are in on it. - If we don't try... - But if you don't... If we don’t try, we won’t know. I know even without trying. Mr. Shindo, I think you’re crazy. Ryuta. There are times when you need to stand for something. You may be too young, but you're a coward. Doing this will help you overcome being a coward. Mr. Shindo, it’s Tokuda, the policeman. He’s here. Ryuta, there won’t be that many opportunities. Why don’t you go with him? Hey! You decided to feel better about yourself? You idiot! Hey, give me coffee! American! What’s going on? Why is everyone here? It’s not like I’m putting on a show here. It would suit you. “From Yakuza to Bad Cop,” why don’t you give it a go? Save the applause for when you get cuffed. That’s a fine ending, Tokuda. Shindo. I heard you took a shot at President Shinoyama? You’re becoming an inconvenience. Why don’t you get out? Everything was going well until you came along. What was going well?! You’re the one who let Shimoyama and his gang roam about! Shut up! Boy. I’m giving you advice. I’m doing you a favor. If you want to do me a favor, can you listen to what Ryuta has to say? What is it? Something you want me to tell your dad? What’s the matter? Tell me. I’m busy too. Hey, what are...? I don’t understand you people. He’s no good, just like his dad. Is that all you want? I guess. I figured you out. I used your rental car to get your driver’s license. It turns out you’re a doctor. You made a huge mistake 3 years ago and quit a major hospital. I hear you’re making ends meet by being a doctor on a tanker. No wonder you’re good friends with Sakaguchi. I was wondering why you were so concerned with Sakaguchi’s health. I guess you’re still a doctor, even if it's a rotten one. Hey, thanks! Here we go. Where do you think you’re sitting? Huh? You’ve been here before. Right! This is Sakaguchi’s seat. It’s fine, we’re taking good care of him at the police station. Don’t make a mess in here! What?! Who the hell do you think you’re talking to?! You’re going to be homeless soon! Watch what you say! You bastard. You came here to do me a favor, right? Damn right! Well, you’re doing no one a favor while you’re Shimoyama’s pet dog. Excuse me. You, what did you do? There are bad ones all around. They’re saying if you don’t get out of here quietly, there will be trouble. We told you! We’re patiently waiting for Sakaguchi to sign the papers. Please, stop meddling in our business. What are you...? Go home. What? Staying is hell. Leaving is also hell. We need to hurry up and decide. Mr. Shindo is amazing. Mama. I’m sorry, but I decided to go elsewhere. I see. - Do you have enough savings? - Yes. Well then. I’ll figure out what I owe you. You’re lucky that you have some place to go. We only have this place. Right? Let’s have a party tomorrow. A farewell party! Get some rest. You’re working tonight too, right? What are you doing with that? I’m taking care of it. What? Stuff for Sakaguchi. What? I thought he would need underwear and stuff by now. You're funny! - No, I’m not. - You are! You're funny. Let's close up. - We're home. - Welcome. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Akai is at the beach. Did the president tell you to kill him? Huh? He didn’t, did he? Hey. You want one? You know, that guy. That Sakaguchi. He’s a strange fellow. I never thought I’d be into anyone at this age. So, it’s not like I don’t get what you’re going through. I thought Sakaguchi and I didn’t have anything left to lose, but he’s been carrying something. So, I figured maybe I’ll help him out a bit since he seemed to be falling. You, Sakaguchi and I, we’re all downhill from here, right? If we don’t have something on our backs, we’ll just roll down the hill and turn into old geeks. Let Sakaguchi go. Can't do that. We’re going to use him till the bitter end and wait for him to fall. There's no time. There's a reason for that. You’re a doctor, right? I want to blackmail Tokuda and get Sakaguchi out. You have the key. I’m coming to get it tomorrow night, so have it ready. I will go So you go too I’m tired of living in tiny Japan Across the ocean is China In China await waves of proof When I think about it, it’s already been 14 years Now, Mongolia is like one big family Asia... Here we go! He swam in the ocean every day. About an hour. And then he read and listened to music. Around this time of day, he would come here and watch the sun set. He said the scent of the tide was different here. I grew up in the mountains, so I have no clue. That particular night, Sakaguchi had that look about him when he left. He secretly took the fruit knife that was here. There’s no way he could kill anyone with that. He basically went to get himself killed. You already know, right? Sakaguchi went to kill himself. He went to piss them off, so that they would shoot him. He wanted to turn their boss into a murderer. That way he can stop all of this. He also wanted to show Ryuta what it was like to be a man. What are those left behind supposed to do? To have the soul mate that I finally met taken, and forced to take care of a cowardly kid. I actually called Takahata... ...when he took off. I asked him not to kill Sakaguchi. Do you want to argue about that? I'm sure you do. Men can bet their lives on things that can’t be seen and be okay. But what about us women? What about women? Sakaguchi must have really fallen for you. Who knows? That person... ...has been acting strange ever since he came back from Tokyo. He’s had that strange cough too. How long does he have? Three months at best. It spread from his lungs to his lymph nodes. The morphine will be ineffective soon. I wanted him to do whatever he wanted to do while he still has mobility. President Shimoyama. He did take care of an ex-boxer outcast like myself all these years. It’s unlike me, so I haven’t announced my retirement. IOU Notes From Shimoyama To Tokuda From Shimoyama To Tokuda What happened to you? Manager Takahata’s wife called and she asked that he get some time off, because he’s not feeling well. I guess it can’t be helped. Let the others know. Hey, tissue. Yes? Huh? Who might you be? President! I was told to inform you that Sakaguchi will be released today. He was released? That’s sudden. - Who was it? - Well. That I don't know. Oba, it’s done steaming! Yes! Rumi’s not here, so... Hey, get some ice! Ryuta, sorry, but come over here. Okay! Wow, that’s extravagant. It's ice. Ryuta, let’s go get him. Okay! - The president is coming home! - You don’t need to go. Mr. Sakaguchi. I’m sorry for all the trouble. Give me the check. Three nights, four days. It’d be 16,000 yen. Mama. Ryuta is... Leave him alone. Hasta luego, dear friend. Hasta luego, dear friend. Let Him Rest In Peace THE END
