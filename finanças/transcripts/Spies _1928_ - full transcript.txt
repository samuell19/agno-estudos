Fritz Lang's SPIONE was restored between 2003 and 2004 by the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung. As no original negative exists, various nitrate copies were used. Due to its length and excellent condition, a copy from the N?rodni Filmovy Archiv, Prague, formed the restoration's basis. Problematic scenes were replaced using materials supplied by Filmarchiv Austria and Screensound Moscow's Gosfilmofond's dupe negative contained a complete set of intertitles displayed as flashtitles. These matched the original intertitles found in part within the Austrian nitrate copy. The original German opening credits sequence has not survived. Cast and crew details were culled from the censor card and rendered in the same graphics as the intertitles.

"Please, let me stay here! Don't send me away again! I won't take up any more space than a little dog...!" "Have I offended you? Must I leave again?"

"I have called you in order to clear things between you and me, Sonja. " "Where is - he -?!" "He's trying to trace you through Jellusic. " SUDDEN DEATH OF COLONEL M.O. JELLUSIC As we learned after press time, Jellusic, colonel extraordinaire at General Headquarters, has died of a heart attack shortly after returning from a holiday trip. "20,000 pounds... in new bank notes - with consecutive serial numbers...!" "A blank telegram, please!" Find out immediately to whom the State Bank has issued notes in denominations of one thousand with... ...consecutive numbers 0319726 to 0319745 stop Return with next flight. "A special operator call...!" "What -?! The bank note numbers?!" "You have to make up your mind, Sonja. Are you on my side - against him?" "You still don't seem to know what I am capable of!" "I have other irons in the fire... " "I will come back, my child - the house shall be yours... you will live there as a little princess... " "I have to leave, Kitty...!" "But not so fast - ! Not so fast -! Just a few more hours -! A few meagre hours... -!" "Don't you see that I will die - if you leave me -?" "As surely as I shall win this battle, Sonja, I will defeat him... Do you nevertheless stick to your decision?!" "And how long are you planning to keep me prisoner?" "Until one of us is the victor, Sonja - he or I!" "No. 326, who is coming back tonight, has sent us a radiogram that falls into your field of expertise... " "Read it for yourself! This matter has to be taken care of before No. 326 returns!" Find out immediately to whom the State Bank has issued notes in denominations of one thousand... "So I'll come tonight with No. 326 to your dressing room!" "I'll take care of the postal censorship - You see to it that all borders are closed! If the treaty falls into the wrong hands, the war in the East is all but declared!" "It's the last car - and it will happen in the tunnel... if No. 326 falls into the trap" "I have told you, Sonja, you will be free when one of us two men triumphs... " "It is I who have been conquered... because I need you!" "No one but you is skilful enough to bring the photos of the treaty across the closed border... Do me this one last service - and the road to the man you love will be open!" "And you swear that he will be safe from you in the future if I say yes -?" "I believe they'll use a foreigner to take the stolen treaty across the border - and the sudden departure of the Russian courier is, at the very least, suspicious... " "... the more so now that 719 has determined that the bank notes for Jellusic also came from Russian hands... " "Unfortunately, I cannot leave here without destroying my cover and jeopardizing my work as No. 719 - but in any event I have reserved the sleeping compartment next to that of the Russian courier... " "Around 6 a. m. You will cross the border - that is the decisive moment!" "I almost forgot what I found the other day... " "The last car of the express train... - crashed in the tunnel... - " "You wretch - ! Did Haghi send you to make sure that his damned plan was successful "You don't intend to betray us, do you... you scoundrel...?" "Attention - Central - Central - Central...!" "Attention - Central - Central - Central...!" "Attention - Central - Central - Central...! No. 326 is alive -! Sonja has betrayed us -!" "We wish to talk to Director Haghi. " "Gentlemen, what could the police be looking for here -?" "A criminal - and the proof of his crime!" "I order you to hand over to me the keys to all of the bank safes!" If the bank is not vacated within 15 minutes of receiving this note, and the police have not withdrawn completely... ...the woman you love, whom I hold in my power, will die. "You have fourteen minutes to live, Sonja! - if he chooses not to obey me!" "People's lives - in danger -! The bank must be searched within 13 minutes, and Haghi's secret room found - do you understand?... - " "Burn all papers... dynamite the safes... In ten minutes the bank will be filled with gas!" "Soon, Sonja, you will know all about the secrets of death - take with you a secret from my life!" "The bank has been searched down to the foundations - there is no trace of a secret exit. " "Gas -!" "Where is Haghi -?" 10,000 MARKS REWARD! Who has seen the man pictured above, Bank Director Haghi, since midday? "Not even a mouse would be able to leave the city he has to be here somewhere... " "There's a small error... I want to report... " "It's just that... the numbers on the thousand pound notes... which I have to deliver a receipt for... the telegram contains different numbers...!" "No. 719... has switched the telegrams...! The Clown Nemo is Haghi!" "A little music please - Mr. Conductor -!" "Curtain -!"
