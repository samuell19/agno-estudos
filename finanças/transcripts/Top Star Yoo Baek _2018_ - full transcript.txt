This is the first time I've seen this type of thing How would I know how to turn off if? Gosh, you're really seeing this for the first time? This is the stove. Oil stove. Stove? The soup is gone... I don't know whether I can cook something else... I am really, really sorry. You must be very hungry. No problem, I'm fine with anything. After all, I'm rarely drink soup in the morning. In that case... Do you want me to whip up those.... What? Scrambled egg? A strong man who needs energy. must at least eat a plate of eggs. Well. I will dig in. You also added milk? That goat over there, we squeezed a lot out of her. I see. Oh, yes. You must drink this too. Is this expresso? Americano? It's charred soup. Then there's no need to drink soup this morning.... Grandma, we can have our mixed rice ok.... mix it up well That's it, all done. Grandma have a taste. Looks good Are you in a hurry? Eat slowly You are going to choke. After eating, I'm going out I want Ma-Dol Oppa to see my how good I've gotten. What do you mean? He keeps mocking me always saying that I only play around I want to let him see how good I've gotten in the water. I want to catch a big abalone and shock him! You know he was only joking He is always looking out for you A real brother wouldn't have done better Right, right.... I know... Ma-Dol this kid, has been good to Kang-Soon since childhood. Even though he has to enter into the fire, he would not hesitate. There is no high school on our island, But come rain or snow, he would still send Kang-soon to the main island for school. If Ma-Dol wasn't around, I don't know how I would have raised her. An old lady like me.... I only know how to cook and feed her don't know what else to do for her If I was not around Kang-soon would have gone to a better school and maybe be as smart as you, Top Star This is all my doing.... Atta, what are you talking about? Grandma has done so much for me Although I feel sad about what happened to mom and dad I am really glad that I had you to raise me OK. My precious baby.... you've grown up so well Let's continue eating. Aigoo. Let's see what is your height. Did I get taller? Gosh, how did you suddenly grow so tall? If you grow just a little taller, you'll be ready to get married. Can I get married if I grow this tall? Gosh, when can I taller? I have to grow taller soon in order to get married to Oppa. What? What are you talking about? You haven't even graduated from high school. Isn't it too soon? Besides, after I graduated from middle school, I plan to quickly take the college entrance examination while in high school. What? Why do you plan to take college entrance examination so soon? Because grandma has a bad back, I want to quickly finish studies to take care of her Aigoo. Omo, Omo. Kang Soon has matured so much Looks like she really is ready to get married I told you already. But Oppa. What should I eat to grow tall faster? Frozen fish? Atta, Oppa! Not playing frozen fish again! I don't want to become a frozen fish. - Please buy a frozen fish named Kang-Soon. - Put me down.... 10 dollars for one! - Quickly put me down! Ma-Dol. OK, I'm coming. Aigoo. What are those? Let me see. These must be for you. For me? Atta, why did you buy such expensive stuff? - Gosh. - It's cheap, really. It's all cheap stuff, so don't stinge,use it. Just use them Don't save them. But Father prefers wine to this. By the way, why is my son's skin so rough? You must have suffered a lot out in the sea. Atta. There's nothing wrong with some hardship for a young man Surely all ship captains have rough skin like him Right, right? Ship Captain wash their hair with rain water, comb their hair in the wind. Nobody would not know you're both father and son Just don't be like your father. His job is just to drink and sleep wherever his head lands Gosh dad. Are you still like that? Don't talk nonsense
