[music playing] NARRATOR: 13 generations ago, our overpopulated world built the Southern Sun, a self-sufficient spaceship that would be home to thousands of migrants with a 10 light year journey to a new and uncolonized world. Our current descendants have come to accept the Southern Sun as their home and work for a better future for their children. While most of the inhabitants of this generation are content, there are some who have grown restless and impatient. COMPUTER: Attention, prepare for shuttle Lancer landing. MAN: Lancer to Southern Sun. Located rescue beacon and survivors. They are all-female and identify themselves as Bellerian We have initiated landing procedures and are returning to base. WOMAN: You will enter the Southern Sun in [inaudible] and your docking bay is one niner, over. MAN: Roger. Shuttle Lancer Locked to guidance control, over. Shuttle landing successful. Bellerian survivors disembarking. MAN: Attention all hands, shuttle landing complete. Prepare for incoming stingray viper squadron. MAN: Red two, Southern Sun in sight. MAN: Attention, all those wishing to meet the incoming Viper squadron proceed to the docking bay. Lea. Hi, dad. Hi, Scott. Hi. Ah, so pretty. If you're going to down to the docking bay to meet your friend from [inaudible],, you better hurry. The viper's in final approach. Well, I came down to check that he's on the flight. Lieutenant Lemont. Commander. Contact the pilot of the stingray viper and ask if Professor Spooner is aboard. Thank you. Sun Control, I have a request. Do you have a Professor Spooner on board? Over. MAN: Stingray to Sun Control, affirmative. Over. - Bye, dad. - Bye bye. Bye, Scott. Bye. MAN: Southern Sun, we are starting our landing sequence. MAN: Southern Sun, abort landing. We have pirates coming up fast on our tales. Stingray two to stingray three, we are under fire. Prepare for defence formation. MAN: Roger, stingray two. MAN: Stingray one, assuming defence formation. We'll cover for you and the professor. What the hell is going on out there? MAN: Look out, red three. MAN: Red three is down. Damn it. WOMAN: Pirate ship, eliminated. MAN: Good shot, Ryder. MAN: Attention all hands, man your battle stations. We're under attack. COMPUTER: Seventh pirate ship eliminated. WOMAN: Recalling stingray fighters. MAN: Roger Southern Sun. This is red two, we're our way. COMPUTER: Rescue mission status. Shuttle Lancer has safely returned with unidentified female survivors who call themselves Bellarians. An approaching squadron of stingrays, under command of David Ryder are under pirate attack. Ryder carries Professor Thomas Spooner as a passenger. WOMAN: Lancer scanner activated. MAN: Ryder, this one's mine. MAN: I'm on it. COMPUTER: Eleventh pirate ship destroyed. MAN: I got it. MAN: [inaudible] I can't thrust. WOMAN: Laser scanner on target. COMPUTER: Pirate ships breaking off and in retreat. Stingray with David Ryder and the professor preparing to land. MAN: This is stingray for Sun Control. Am vectoring into position for final approach. Over. Southern Sun, Roger, stingray. Change to frequency 0015 and standby. Over. MAN: Roger, Sun Control. Over. MAN: Commander Kalgan, can I help you? Excuse me, sir. Commander, sir, what are you doing? No, no, no. WOMAN: Reduce main thrust and standby to receive your docking instructions. Over. MAN: Stingray to Sun Control, affirmative. Over. Sun Control to stingray, you will enter our guidance control in figures five seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Cut main rocket. Reduce boost power to 500 pounds. You are now on the Southern Sun's guidance control system. MAN: This is stingray, we're on your guidance control, over. Keep the energy for the magnetic strobes constant at 200,000. Yes, sir. Constant and holding. COMPUTER: Warning, system power locked. Energize on emergency landing strobe. We're off circuit. It's dead, sit. COMPUTER: Guidance system failing. Shit. We lost power. We lost power. COMPUTER: Viper out of control. Collision immanent. Pilot emergency beam down. Ejection system activated. MAN: Attention all hands, prepare for crash landing. [screaming] MAN: Attention, pilot beam down successful, medical team standby. Fire control to docking bay. Look out, it's gonna blow. Move. It's gonna blow. Move, move. Oh, shit. Come here. The professor's [inaudible]. We don't have time, it's gonna blow. [inaudible] It's gonna blow. Oh my god, the professor. [laughter] What happened, lieutenant? The viper was locked into the Sun's guidance control, commander, and we lost power. Commander, the energizing turbines have been sabotaged. Sabotaged? WOMAN: Headquarters. - Blake here. Give me Kalgan. WOMAN: He's right here. Go ahead. Sir, I just saw something I thought you should know about. Some strange women came on board with the Lancer. I'm sorry the information is so scanty, but I'll send you up more as I get it. Blake out. What do you think, Devers? I think whoever did this knows his way around spaceships. I agree. One thing's for sure, we've got to reduce speed drastically till we repair the damage. You know, I'm thinking more about the possible motive. Why? Commander? You get a computer readout on the damage in the docking bay. Also the pirate fleet's position. And load the file into the computer. I'd like to do some research on our new female guests, the Bellerians. I want that ready as soon as possible. Aye aye, sir. Thank you, Devers. Ladies, this is your new home. I know it doesn't look like much, but if you'll bear with us I'm sure we can make you quite comfortable. (PSYCHICALLY) Leave. We Bellerians wish to be alone. This place will serve our purpose. Leave. It's a pleasure having you on board. Gentlemen. [laughter] Our timing was perfect. Two for the price of one. [laughter] Who would have thought that one small spacecraft could have done that much damage. That viper's missile pod took out the entire wrenching system for the docking bay doors. According to the damage reports from the chief maintenance engineer, it will take at least two weeks before the docks can be used again. We couldn't have wished for it better. That means the southern sun is completely isolated. Nobody can enter her and more important, nobody can leave her. Excellent. They no longer have a choice. [laughter] It was cruel fate to be born in space. But I have vowed we will not die here. It is my destiny to set my feet upon a real world and to accumulate wealth and power beyond our wildest dreams. I have offered the people of the Southern Sun a rich new life and now they have no alternative but to accept my generosity and alter course for Corona Borealis. [laughter] Lieutenant, what's the report from damage control. It's not complete yet, captain. But the first reports indicate that two of our LM 5,000 Exeron drive motors have been sabotaged. This also affects the performance of one of our vix impulse drive generators. Give me a computer readout on our hull stress factor. Sir. Reduce speed by 2/3. Shut down two of our booster engines. Yes, sir. Oh, one other thing, can you establish video contact with the docking bay? One of the missiles from the viper took out the video control tower down there. But we are trying to re-establish contact with a Sara video robot. We've been in space too long. Let us land the ship. We can do it. We have the power. It's true, we have the power to do this. But this would directly oppose the law of the universe, the law of the galaxy. Forget the law. No, no, the law must be upheld, we cannot break it. Gentlemen, it seems that we are not all in agreement. Engineer Parsons seems content to spend his remaining years upon the Southern Sun. Then let him do so alone. This is mutiny, this is treason, which I warn you, I must report. Will you allow him to spoil your ambitions for a greater future? I will not allow that. No. Come over here. No Get him over here. - Traitor. - Hold him. Let me at him. Hit him. Hold him down, hold him down. [inaudible] OK. [inaudible] Hold him, hold him. MAN: He's still alive again. Do it again. Are there any other of you that wish to confuse freedom with treason? MAN: Not me. MAN: Not at all. MAN: Not me. Revert to the enforcers bridge. Let's go, report, hurry up. You have done well. You will be rewarded. Hi, Scott Devers. - Dave Ryder. - Pleased to meet you. Shall we do it? - OK. Lieutenant. Sir. - Please file this. - Certainly, sir. Thank you. Commander Jansen. Well, welcome aboard, Mr. Ryder. You've met our Captain Devers. Sit down, son. Thank you, sir. Ryder, could I have your space status card, please? Thank you. Well there we have it. Any questions, Mr. Ryder? Sir, I'd like to see a video of the crash, if I may. Good idea. Come this way. Take a chair. Lieutenant. Yes, sir. Can you punch up a video of the crash, please? Yes, sir. COMPUTER: Disaster analysis. Guidance system engaged. You are now on the Southern Sun's guidance control system. Over. Pilot control released. Warning, critical power loss. You received our message. I'm glad you've come. We've been waiting for you. Hey you, the Bellarians are off limits. I was-- Well, there we are, gentlemen. Tell me, Dave, your Viper was equipped with a new high-density de-atomizer escape system, right? Yes, commander. Right now it only works over very short distances. But who knows what the future potential of it could be. What about the professor? Commander, I'm sorry about the professor. There's nothing I could have done. The system's only hooked up to the Viper pilots. Don't blame yourself, son. You're lucky you're alive. You're lucky you saved yourself. Lea, you had us all worried. Please, next time there's a fire, leave it to damage control. You OK? OK? Next time, young lady, you stay out of the way. Dad I was there, the pilot chickened out. Otherwise Spooner would be alive right now. David Ryder, I want you to meet my daughter, Lea. The professor never had a chance. There's nothing I could have done to prevent it. Oh, so you left him to die-- Lea, stop it. He ejected and he's alive. Listen lady-- Doctor. Doctor. I don't have to justify my actions to you. But since you're asking, that explosion cut the power and there wasn't time to go over the auxiliary backup system. I had to eject. I had no other choice. Commander, Captain, excuse me, I have to file my report. Lea. Excuse me, sir, I think you'll find this interesting. Yes, what is it? It's an inventory of all the explosives under our control. Give me an audio video linkup, bridge to console seven. Please hurry. There's something coming through on the voice monitor from the engine room area. Put it through on five. My name is the Flight Lieutenant Lemont. Well, according to my printout from the supply stores inventory, we're definitely short on conventinoal ballistic explosive. I mean, I double checked. Somebody with direct online access to central has been transferring large amounts of explosive and then simply covering the requisition. I wouldn't have found out about it unless central asked me to confirm acceptance of 100 units of chemo plastic and atomic compound. I mean, that's crazy. Can you imagine that amount of explosive lying around in the ship's engine room? Anyway, I think I've traced who it is. Who in the hell is he talking to? Put it through to the bridge. STEVE CODELL: I want to speak to somebody from command, please. OK. For the sake of security, I think it would be better if you came up here and asked for me, Lieutenant Lemont. Send a couple of men over there to stop that engineer before he gets to the bridge, unless I get to him first. [laughter] Third engineer Steve Codell? You have two choices-- join me or the deep freeze. I prefer to jump, Kalgan. Be my guest. [yelling] [laughter] Hi. Got a nice place here. Listen, I understand how you feel. You? How could you know how I feel? Listen, lady, I did what I had to do. Don't you think I realized a good man died? A man I respected and loved? Hey, I don't need this. Wait. I wasn't aware that you knew him. What difference does it make? He's dead and there's nothing we can do about it. Forget it. I don't need this. [music playing] Is a woman allowed to buy a man a drink in your galaxy? It kind of depends on the man now, doesn't it? On what. On whether or not he wants to accept it. I see, you're still angry. Yeah. But I'll get over it. You know, the professor taught me everything I know. Can we start again? Yeah, why not? We made a mess of it the first time. Dave Ryder. Lea Jansen, glad to meet you. Nice to meet you. You like it here? Yeah, it's not bad. That's odd. What's that? I know the woman over there. She works on the bridge. She's being ushered out. Is there any reason for it? I don't know. Looks like she's been arrested. Let's go check it out. Flight Lieutenant Lemont? Yes. Thank you, gentlemen. You were speaking with Third Engineer Steve Codell. That is my business. But now I'm making it mine. There they go. Let's take this. [laughter] Go. Hey, look out. Bastard. Shit. Son of a bitch. Eagle one to enforcer control. Eagle one to enforcer control. I've got a six-niner in progress in sector 13. Terminate with extreme prejudice. I repeat, extreme prejudice. Roger, eagle one. Dave, this is crazy. I don't understand what's going on on the ship. Well, this confirms it, my crash was no accident. It was planned. Now we got to find out who the hell was in charge. Where do we begin? We'll go back to the bridge and see your father. We'll go from there. Pete, look out. It's an ambush. Let's get out of here. Go. All right, let's move. Tell Kalgan we've located him in section 49. We're moving in. WOMAN: Roger. All right, let's go. Sir. There's your report, sir. Thank you, Devers. Do you really believe, sir, that this act of sabotage has got something to do with our navigational course? Yeah, I'm convinced. This proves it. I think they want to drive us into the neighboring constellation. Helveca? The constellation of the Corona Borealis. Pirate territory. Precisely. Sir, we have to find out who's behind this. Any ideas, commander? Yes. You know, captain, it's always very dangerous to speculate. Yes, sir. So it would have to be somebody on this ship who can gain by this. Stand to gain. That leaves us with what? The flight master? The enforcer? It's very perilous for everyone on board. We do not make wild accusations so we keep this top classified secret. - Commander. - Yes. Someone to see you. Check it. Yes? Can I help you? Yes, you can. We're looking for the enforcer's headquarters. It really is awfully lonely here. Can I show you around? Come on, let's get the hell out of here. Wait. This looks interesting. Would you care for a spot of tea? Well, we're in a bit of a hurry. What are all these bodies for? A personal collection. Collection? Yes. When anyone is under suspicion they're immediately arrested, tortured, and given the truth drug. When Kalgan is convinced they're of no longer use, he simply has them ejected into space. However, if they seem redeemable, Kalgan freezes them. That means all the enforcers are corrupt and Kalgan's running his own personal army here. That's correct. How many enforcers has Kalgan killed? To date, 38. So Kalgan's control of the enforcers is complete and any of the enforcers that resisted him are dead. Or frozen. How many enforcers are there? Just over 200. The deep freeze. Now thank you for calling. Do call again. With the population and the crew of the Southern Sun being so large, surely we can do something? It'll be a bloodbath. Well, if they've broken intergalactic law, that's mutiny. We can call for help. It's my guess the Kalgan has already installed scramblers in the communications computer. And the landing bay's closed due to my crash. Well, I'm not going to stand by while all these people are held hostage by some terrorist. The most important thing we've got to do is get weapons. But whatever we're going to do, we got to do it fast. Let's get going. The man and the woman, have you seen them? Yes. Charming couple. Idiot. We must have just missed them. Let's go. [alarm] No. Cut them off. Let's go. Forget it. They're headed for the bridge. Get back to your posts. Let's go. Move. COMPUTER: Welcome Commander Jansen. How may I help you? Open file on Bellerian behavior. COMPUTER: Bellerian behavior. Order of high priestesses. Non planet based practitioners of magic. Commander, it is now time for us to talk. You. Yes. I am Jennera, the 14th high priestess of the Trypton lineage. The people of the Southern Sun are no longer able to distinguish light and dark. Your people are falling prey to the powers of darkness. Listen, I speak the truth. What happened? I have shared with you the way to truth. Now you must use what you have learned to face Kalgan and his evil. I will. Would everyone please sit down. Thank you. I called this conference because I feel that decisions made here will affect everyone on board the Southern Sun. My prime consideration is that we have an overriding responsibility in shaping the destiny and future of our progeny, our children, our heirs and successors. We know that Kalgan and the mutineers have stolen large amounts of explosives. It's our belief they want us to change course and head for the corona borealis. But everyone knows that's pirate territory. We'd be destroyed long before we entered their field of influence. We don't think so. I'd understand it if we were a rich cargo ship carrying minerals or weapons. But what can they expect to achieve from the likes of us? People. The Southern Sun could recognize one of the planets of the constellation or be re-dispersed as slave labor. I'm sure a solution to our problem can be worked out. It can? You think he's just dreamt up the scheme overnight? He's been planning this, this mutiny and he's worked out all the details. And you can count on it that he's got all of these men behind him. Now commander, I've done all the talking I intend to do. So if you'll please excuse me. You're excused. Thank you. My father and his father before him were both reasonable men. I myself have tried to follow in their footsteps. I'm a man who believes in peace, not war. Captain Devers and I have decided, David, if you will accept, we would like to name you as our new flight commander and we trust and pray you will maintain this as a ship of peace. And we will in due course let all the people know and warn them of Kalgan and his men. Well, David, good luck. SCOTT DEVERS: Your attention please. Captain Devers speaking. Ladies and gentlemen, the commander of the Southern Sun, Commander Jansen, will now make a special address to all on board. ALEX JANSEN: In recent weeks, there has been a series of sabotage attacks and murders on board the Southern Sun. We now know who is responsible and why. The man is the flight master and chief enforcer, Elijah Kalgan. It is his intention to take command of the Southern Sun and force us to change our navigational course for the pirate world of Alfaka. As commander of the Southern Sun, it is my intention to resist these demands. Therefore, I have relieved Kalgan of command and appointed a new flight commander. His name, David Ryder. I hope your trust and confidence in my captain and crew will continue. And together we will seek out this evil among us. And I long for the day when once again peace will prevail aboard the Southern Sun. Thank you. It's obvious I've underestimated him. It's true, Kalgan, they've managed to uncover even the smallest details of our well-laid plans. The survival of that viper pilot, Dave Ryder, and his winning ways with Alex Jensen and his meddling daughter have caused us nothing but grief. It was one of Ryders viper squadron many years ago who left me with this. Ryder must be eliminated at once. The rest of our problems are more easily solved. I'm growing more and more impatient with the stubborn ungratefulness of that old fool Jansen and the rest of those idiots on the bridge who have scored my offer for a more rewarding future. We must act at once. What do we do next? Locate Ryder and the girl and then wait for my instructions. MAN: We should change flight commanders every day. Well, David, cheers. It's a great honor serving you and your ship, the Southern Sun. Here's to you David. And happiness. That's what it's all about. Commander, where's Lea? Lea? Oh, Lea. David, I think you'll find her in her usual place. The greenhouse. Excuse me. Yes. Well, captain, can you remember when you were that young? I'll be damned if I can. You know something? When I was a little girl I used to come here. This was always my special place. I can understand why, it's lovely here. Yeah, my place is the docking bay. My father, his father, and his father before him were all pilots. That's all I ever wanted to be was pilot. Dave, what's going to become of our people? We'll survive. We'll beat Kalgan, I promise you that. But are we strong enough? We have the will to survive. We will. Where was I? Before you get going again, I got some things to do right now. Come on, it'll be all right. Why didn't you call me the second they deserted their post? The minute they didn't respond, I came to you. I didn't know what else to do. What happened? [inaudible] Talk to me, what happened. Happened? Nothing happened. Kalgan warned us about these women. Knock it off, Colton. Grab these idiots, take them down to refrigeration and put them on ice. Heads are going to roll when Kalgan finds out about this. Is this the man? Soften him up. No, no more. I don't like people who make mistakes. We're going to put you on ice for a while. Wait, I want to know what's going on. What's happening with my men? What's the matter, Ranger, afraid you're losing control? Yes. I'm losing control over my men and over what I'm responsible for. Don't be so naive. You want off the ship as much as anybody. That may be true, but I'm not willing to sacrifice the lives of [inaudible]. Look, Kalgan's got his a plan. We're getting off the ship with the help of the pirates and there's nothing you nor I nor anybody else can do about it. MAN: This is the Alfaka pirate fleet. To those on board the Southern Sun, listen carefully. You have entered the alpha delta restricted zone. We have a claim on this section of space. Surrender immediately or be blown into astro dust. MAN: Red alert, Red alert. We are under fire. We are under fire. All hands to your battle stations. Even under these circumstances, I hate violence. COMPUTER: Target spaceships in range. Prepare to fire missile. Fire one. Fire two. Pirate ship terminated, Return to posts. MAN: While on board, congratulations. We have successfully defended the Southern Sun again the latest pirate attack. But we must now focus on internal problems. May I have your attention please. The officers of the watch please form three groups. The first group is going to be responsible for making weapons. The second group is going to act as soldiers. The third group is responsible for getting food and supplies. I suggest we close up all the entries and exits to the engine room. We're going to hold out here and never let them take over the Southern Sun. Let's get out there and kick some ass. [cheering] Asshole. Your commission, sir. If they seal off the doors along these narrow companionways, they'll be able to defend the engine room from an attacking army with very little effort. Except here, the boiler room vents. No one would expect anyone to enter through there. Their entire defence strategy would be intent on people entering through the doors. Run that through the computer again. If the results are positive, meet me in the interrogation room. I've got a little surprise for everyone. Lovely spot, isn't it? What are you doing here? You're much more attractive with your mouth shut. Bring her to my headquarters at once. Let's go. [laughter] Jason, go get Lea. I want her on the bridge immediately. Commander, message coming through on channel 16. Jansen, I have something to show you. Oh no. You have 12 hours to surrender the bridge, otherwise your daughter will be jettisoned into space. Well, captain? Kalgan lives like that, sir. He lives by the sword. He's evil, ruthless. There are many people on board the ship, sir. We have to fight back. Go on. Sir, we both know that there's only one man on the ship who's capable of combat, who's had the training, physically and mentally. All right. We will prepare for battle. Thank you, Devers. Have Dave Ryder sent to the bridge immediately. Yes, sir. MAN: Flight Commander Ryder, report to the bridge. Drop it. Don't move. Let me introduce you to the high intensity probing laser. I do have one weakness-- pain, other people's. Now, I'm going to use this laser on one of your teeth. It works not unlike ancient dental equipment. Not that you'd know anything about that. You bastard. Now, how about your father's contingency plans? You bastard. [knocking] What a shame to burn out these lovely teeth. I want those countermeasures. I don't feel a thing. [cough] Turn it off. I see you've got the girl. I had to let them know we meant business. I'd better get back to the engine room before they miss me. I'll take you. Hi, Murray, it's Joseph here. MAN: Yo, pal. Now listen, my monitor has gone off again. MAN: I'll schedule you for next week. Well, can't you fix it any sooner? MAN: We're backed up already. OK, whenever you can. MAN: Anything for you, buddy. OK, take it easy. Hey, you, come here. Yeah, you, come over here. Closer. Closer. Closer. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Is the rest of the equipment as good as that? Let's have a look. Wait, I'll make you a trade. First your trousers and then you can see everything. OK. OK, here. My shoe. Your shoe? Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. What took you so long? I've been busy, too. Let's get his clothes. You bitch. Bitch. MAN: Eagle one, come in. Calling Commander Kalgan, this is enforcer control. Eagle one, Commander Jansen's daughter is gone. What do you mean, she's gone? How could that happen? MAN: That idiot back in the torture room let her escape. I'll handle that later. Where is she now? MAN: She and Ryder have been spotted on level 17. Send for reinforcements and get back to me immediately. Come on, move out [inaudible] [alarm] Get ready to move. Looks clear. Let's go. Come on, move, move, come on, move. Behind you. Kalgan, we've lost them. Idiot. You put this on, OK? All right, let's move. All right, let's go. Hey, you guys, let's see some ID. All right, let's move. Have you located the girl? Answer me. I'm surrounded by incompetence. I'm being undermined by my own disciples. You let that space bitch slip through our fingers. She was our-- where's that idiot who let her escape? We've got him on ice, sir. Kill him at once. Yes, sir. And then tell MacPhearson our plan is operational. Put the entire squad on red alert. [alarm] MAN: Red alert, everyone to their posts. Let's go, let's move, everyone to their posts. Red alert, move it. Let's go, move it. Let's go. This is it [inaudible] stay cool. [inaudible] Lea, oh thank God you're safe. Thank God. Commander, we have a problem. Yes, David. MacPhearson's a traitor. Yes, I saw him with Kalgan at the enforcer's headquarters. Can't believe it. I mean, it could be-- Dad, I saw him there today. Today? That being the, case this is serious. He knows our codes, he has our weapons. Weapons. And he knows all our countermeasures. I find this unbelievable. He's one of my best men. He's my chief engineer. Commander, if I may say so, let me do my job. I'm coming with you. I'm coming, too. Captain I'd rather do it alone. As you please, Dave. But thank you. Lea, you stay here. Commander. One cannot escape one's own destiny. [alarm] We're going in. Damn you. Sneaky little shit. Stop right there. We're being attacked from above. Commander Commander Ryder, we're being attacked from above. The enforcers are-- He's going below. After him. Move. Cut him off. [inaudible] Let's go, go, go. So many good lives wasted. War always brings out the worst in men. I don't know [inaudible] I feel that I've failed. No, commander, don't blame yourself. It had to happen. There was no compromise. Out of my way, you idiot. [inaudible] your guys get back to the engine room. Move. Move, all right, get out of here. Let's get out of here. Back to the engine room. Move, move. Don't waste your time, you'll never get through there. You'll get dead. It's over. Now let's get out of here. I'm leaving. Lea. Lea. Lea, come back. Forget it, Devy, you can't stop love. It says in the Bellerian book the universal truth will always prevail. MacPhearson, your time has come, you are the first. Lea, MacPhearson. He's gone into the gas expulsion sump. Ryder, it doesn't have to be this way. Think about it, we can work this thing out. I didn't have anything to do with this. What are you doing, man? What's that smell? What are you doing? Let's go back on the bridge. I've never seen anybody burn before. What the hell you doing, anyway? That could have been you dead down there. You should have stayed up on the bridge, safe with your father. The enforcers are not going to attack again. Yeah, how the hell do you know that? Well, if you'd shut up, I'd tell you. Kalgan's dead. They have no leader. They have no choice but to surrender to my father. Besides, I thought you would be happy to see me. Of course I am. That's not the issue. Your father should have stopped you. My father stopped interfering with my life when I was 15 years old. I have a lot of respect for your father, he's a good man. I just wish he could control you as well as he does this ship. Control me? If I hadn't saved you in that engine room-- Oh come on, I would got out of that situation no problem. Well that's gratitude. Why did you do it? Because-- oh never mind. You really are stubborn. Now it is time for Kalgan. Lea, you all right? I'm fine. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. You'll wish you'd never come here, Ryder. I'm going to get you, you bastard. Meddling fool. Lea, get out of the way. Shit. Son of a bitch. Lea, look out. [laughter] Look out. Take this you big bitch. [laughter] Shit, come on. [laughter] You bastard. No. Lea, Lea, you OK? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened? Don't worry about it. Kalgan's gone forever. It's finished. Thank God. Yeah. Let's get out of here. MAN: Attention Commander Ryder, stingray patrol ready for takeoff. Won't you miss your flight? Does that mean you won't marry me? Oh David. [music playing] (SINGING) They say I'm a fool because I believe. I know enough to know I can dream. The words of the wind it cuts across the town. My moment is here, my moment is now. Here I stand on the edge of a dream. The future before me and time in between. Here I am on the edge of a dream. Edge of a dream. They say I'm too late as if it's a crime. Yet here on the edge, there's no feeling of time. I'm eager to dare and willing to try. Maybe I'll fall but maybe I'll fly. Here I stand on the edge of a dream. The future before me and time in between. Here I am on the edge of a dream, edge of a dream.
