Just until we find the right institution. Uncle Asher, be well, feel good. What'about her brother? Look, there's a suitable hostel that can take him in a few weeks. A few weeks? - 2 or 3. It's a good place that's worth waiting for. Listen, I... I leave the house at 7am and don't come back until the evening. Who will take care of him all day? I know you live in a 3 room apartment and you seem fit enough to tend to his needs. But in urgent circumstances, don't you have a temporary arrangement? It's worth waiting for a good place. Gadi. Take him for now. Gadi, come. You'll live with your father until we can find an arrangement. Can't he help you out at the garage? I'll help out at the garage, I'm a world champ cleaner.

My grandfather was the best mechanic in Jerusalem. So is my dad, but I'm a singer. I’m making a CD with songs I wrote. I also like Shlomo Artzi and the late Arik Einstein and Shiomi Shabat Shalom. Come sit down and eat. Sit here. Jackie, prepare a dish for Gadi. Enjoy. Oh no.. What's wrong? Everything is touching everything. Here you go. Is this better? - Much better. What's your name? Adela. You're a pretty girl, Adela. Thank you. Do you have a boyfriend? Where's Dede? - I don't know. Do you want to be my girlfriend? I'll write a song for you. Enjoy the food, Gadi. - Thank you. Adela, stop, someone might see us. Let's go out tonight. Come over to my place and then we'll see. I'm tired of hanging out at your place. Let's go dancing... We'll see, I'm exhausted. You're enjoying the food? Do you like it, Gadi? Very. -Good. Would you screw her, Gadi? You should have seen how this guy washes cars. I'll help you. Thanks, Gadi. - Of course I'll help you. Up.

The water pump, replace it. I have to finish the Rover first. - No, first change the pump. Come and listen to the Rover. - I don't have time. Reuven, it'll only take a second. The third valve is faulty, it has to be filed down. -Oh. Reuven, I wanted to talk to you. Are you alright? - I'm fine. Listen... Not now, Dede. Mr. Abramov, you must change your lifestyle completely. Your kidneys are failing, you must start dialysis. What does that mean? The machine will remove the toxins from your blood. We'll start with twice a week and go up to three, if we have to. - Twice a wee'k? I have a business to run. And you must cut salt out of your diet. That itching is a symptom of your kidney condition. Nausea, vomiting. Your bones can break, your muscles can atrophy. None of that will kill you, but if your kidneys don't function, then... Dr. Hori. - Huri. -Dr. Huri, I hardly drink anymore, I went down from 3 packs of cigarettes a day to barely one. 'You can't even be subjected t® second hand smoke. Your shortness of breath will get more severe. If you're 60 years old and nothing hurts, that means you're dead. That's what my late father used to say. How old was he when he died? 52. You're a champ, Gadi. No one washes cars as good as you. You're a champ. You've never seen a champ like me. I have to be at a mtee'feg at The car's ready. Gadi will just finish up and you're good to go. You’re very pretty. He knows his women, huh? Do you have a boyfriend? I'm married. - ®h. Her husband has good taste, doesn't he. Gadi? Her husband has good taste. Could you please hurry him up? Since Gadi started working here, people come here just for his car washes. Lunchtime. Hey! Where is he going? It's lunchtime, he's starving his ass off. - Starving my ass off... But I'm late for a meeting. - I'm just a hired hand. Abramov! What kind of imbeciles do you have working here? - Dede, finish off her car. And you, don't come here anymore. What the heck are you doing? Leaving in the middle of a wash? The clients have to wait until you come back from lunch? I'm starving my ass off. What are you, an idiot? I always eat lunch at 1 o'clock. You’ll eat when I tell you to eat. With Mom I always ate at one, I'm not asking you! Go! And don't come back! Imbecile. I don't want to work for him anymore, he's a shithead. Reuven's a good man, Gadi. He's a good man? He was my dad's best friend and when my dad died, I was 12 and wanted a Bat Mitzvah party like my friends, but my mom didn't have money. So Reuven paid for my Bat Mitzvah party and to this day he's like my dad. Then why does he yell at me? He yells and then he regrets it. He didn't regret leaving nae aiad Mom. He came to visit. Only on my Bar Mitzvah. And on your 20th birthday. - He shouldn't yell at me and Call me an idiot in front of everyone. Come. Come to eat. Rita, why don’t you have children? Come to eat. My family is a mess. My siblings are constantly arguing over who will be the donor. My little brother is about to enlist to the army, Menashe the eldest said. "How can you be a combat soldier with only one kidney?" My middle sister is single. My mother says to her: No one will want you, you can't be a donor. My brother Moshe said: 'TH be the donor, no problem." "No, it has to be a young kidney, you're old." Life sucks, man. "Nave Hadar" Institution. I'm looking into an availability for someone. Who do I have to speak to? "Neve Hadar" We have a meeting with the principal. Gadi. Hey. Going home. Gadi, get over here... - I want to go home... Gadi, come with me. - I don't want... -Come. Your son will love this place, we're like one big happy family. Two in a room, food in abundance, a different menu every day. Even I eat in our dining room. Better than my wife's cooking. What if he's not happy here? Then I return all your checks, except the deposit. I’m hungry! I told Dima that I don't like hardboiled eggs! - Yossi, not now. I asked for scrambled eggs and he said I won't get breakfast at all. I'm hungry! Come here! I'm sorry, Sir, he got away. I hate hardboiled eggs! I'm hungry! You can't keep everyone happy... His parents begged me to keep him here. Shouldn't have listened to them. You won't find a better home than ours. We'll see. - We'll see. We'll see and see. Come, Gadi. And we'll see and see and see. I've had it with these loonies. Don't like hardboiled eggs either. What? - I don't like hardboiled eggs, only omelets. With a tomato sliced into six. Exactly, pal. Dad, let me drive. Are you nuts? "Reuven's Garage" Hello, Mr. Abramov, how are you? Reuven, call me Reuven. -Okay. Sit down. - No, thanks. I just came to see how Gadi is doing. A surprise visit? Maybe I'm abusing him? Heaven forbid. Are you alright? Must be something I ate. What about the institution you mentioned? Oh, it's not an institution, it's a village for people with special needs. Gadi is first on the waiting list. I see he likes working here. I wish I could say the same. Reuven, be patient. I know the principal. I'll hang in there for another week or two. It'll be another 3-4 months. 3-4 months?! - It's an exceptional place. Can't... -It's worth waiting for, Reuven. - I can’t. Taking care of him isn't easy. Not to mention the expenses. Maybe we can apply for a special benefit from National Insurance. That would be very nice of you. Done. I'll come around with the supervisor to see how he's doing. I'll tell you when and you'll prepare him. Alright... I'm going to the diner to talk to Gadi. My father used to say: "Every bad thing has a good side." Hello? No, Benny, no. If the judge finds out he won’t authorize it.. Oh no.. How ijnany times do I have to tell you? What's wrong? Six slices. Everything is touching everything. Take a good look, I'm sick of telling you. Just eat, the supervisor will be here at 8 o'clock. Like this. Gadi, eat up. I put it in order, why aj;e you messing it up? Don't you remember I explained it to you? A show, right, right. Bring me the slicery. The "slicery" Slice-Cut, Slicery-Cutlery... Hurry up. Finish the plate. Eating slowly is healthy. That's what Mom.. That's what they say. Hurry up, Ilana and the supervisor will be here at any minute. Would you screw her, Dad? - Screw her?! Where did you hear that? - From Dede. He's screwing this girl real good. Are you screwing anyone? Mum's the word. - Mum's the word. What? She can't keep her eyes off you. - Who? Ilana. Stop it, I don't want you eating when the supervisor is here. Do you want to screw her too? Do you remember what to do? A show, a show. - Exactly. Don't forget. Go on, chow down. When's your birthday? On Pass.. On Purim. Passover or Purim? Neither. Since his mother died, he's been more distraught and very slow. I can't leave him alone, he... - Gadi, how old are you? Dad knows. ' -He's 38. Do you ever go to the grocery store? No. Do you bathe on your own? No. Do you dress yourself? No. Do you brush your teeth on your own? Yes. - Good. Yes. Good. You can call that brushing his teeth... One more thing, I want to see how you tie up your shoelaces. Gadi, take off your shoe. Now put it on. And tie up the shoelace. I want to leave, I want to leave... - It's alright, Gadi. Are we done here? We're in a hurry. - Yes, we're done. Come to the garage, I'll wash your car. You work at a garage? Of course. Work, he just makes a mess. Nava, may I have a word? - Yes. Reuven, I'll be in touch. Thank you. When will we know? -Soon. Bye, Gadi. Nava, a word. - I'm on my way, yes. Dad, I wrote a new song. You want to hear it? Dad. Did you take your meds? - Of course. Listen. "Pain has gone, joy came instead Two lovers met "Crying that hangs on happiness "Good to see you again, my love" Are you listening? Yes, yes, very nice. She loves me too. Who? Adela. I want to marry her. I don't think she's right for you. - Why not? Because she's.. She's black.. I like black girls, they're nicer to me. There are many fish in the sea. I hate fish. Cheers! - I have a grandson! -Cheers! Raise your glasses! - Cheers! -Congratulations! Gadi! Congratulations! Gadi, I have a grandson. Congratulations, congratulations. Congratulations, Nissim. Here's to you, Gadi! -Raise your glasses, guys! Everyone on their feet. Music! Rita, where's the music? - Congratulations! You're such a champ, Gadi. Gadi. Music! - Gadi, don't drink so fast. Everyone, drink up! You dance so well. Dance, guys, dance. Cheers, guys! Clap your hands. Gadi... Gadi, that's enough. Reuven, have a drink. - I'm a champ. You mustn't drink, Gadi. You mustn't drink. You feel better now? Where's Adela? Wash your face, you'll feel better. There you go. I brought you some dinner. Adela said she enjoyed dancing with you. She said I'm a champ. You are a champ. Sit up. Eat. Come on now. She said I'm a champ. Of course she did. She loves me. We'll get married. Gadi, she won’t marry you. You're lying. Mom always said you're a liar. Stop with the Mom already. I feel bad for you, your son is screwed up. Don't say that. - He can't drive, no one wants to marry him... You'll find someone. You will, it's just... - You're ashamed of me. No I'm not. - Oh yes you are! But don't you worry, I'll solve your problem. Looks like the game is over. Wow, Benayoun! Beitar Jerusalem scores its fourth goal... Here. Yesterday's and this morning. Okay. Open your mouth. Thank you. How about we take a day off sometime and go to the beach in Tel-Aviv? Get back to work. Want to come over tonight? - Hey... Does she want to come over tonight? She has to study for an exam. Tomorrow's better. Tomorrow he's meeting up with friends. She can go with. He's free tonight. He wants to eat in Abu Gosh. No one knows him in Abu Gosh? Adela, Adela? Find someone you're not ashamed of around your friends. Yes. - Reuven? -Yes. This is Ilana. The social worker. Hi, Ilana, how are you? - I'm fine. Listen, Reuven, there's room in that village I mentioned. I think Gadi should live there for a few days to see how he likes it. Ilana, I'm working, maybe we can... - Dad! You don't want him to try it out? - Dad! -Yes... No, I mean... - Dad, Dede wants the keys to the Peugeot. Reuven, it's the best place for people with special needs. Hello? Reuven? - Oh no... Yes, yes, I'm listening. I want to take him there tomorrow morning... - Gadi, where are those keys? Reuven? Don't put your hand in! Hello? Reuven, do you hear me? Yes, yes, I hear you. Talk to Gadi, prepare his meds and clothes for 3 days. I have to go to Dede. Ilana... Shouldn't I see the place first? I'd like to see the place first. It's best you don't come with at this point. Oh. I'll pick him up tomorrow at 7:30 am... - Ilana... Okay. -Bye. Are you finishing up? There's exact change in here in case you need it. I'm trying to take a shower. Come out. -Stop it! Ilana's here, get a move on. - You're bothering me... -Let's go. Stop it! It’s okay. Lana's here. You said I won't be going to an institution. - It's not an institution. Here, dry yourself off. Besides, it's only for a few days. If you don't like it, I won't force you to stay. If they only have hardboiled eggs, I'm not staying. Ilana said they have food that you'll like Dry off. They have a music class. You can join the choir if you like. Yes? Batia, relax, I'm on it. How are you, Rivka? - I'm good, Ilana. -Great. It's good to see you. - Thank you. Gadi! Hi, Gadi, I'm Rivka. Would you like to see our petting zoo? A baby goat was born last night. Well then... We're going to the petting zoo. You can join us if you like. Gadi.. That's okay, I'm spending the day, he'll come when he's ready. Gadi, a 10 o'clock snack. Here you go. Enjoy. Hello. What's your name? I'm Michal. Bye bye. Michal, don't stop as long as the song is playing. Keep going. Reuven? - Hello, Ilana. What's going on? He was reluctant at first, but he got a nice room and went to sleep. When can I come visit? Give him these 3 days on his own. I hope he'll like it there. - He will. -I hope so. Okay, so... 'll be in touch. Good night. - Good night. Eh... Yes? - Ilana... How about we have a bite to eat? Now? -Tomorrow. On one condition, Reuven. That I pay for myself. Out of the question, you'll pay for us both. Good night. Michal, you sang so well. Thank you. I'm a singer too. You are? - I'm making a CD with songs that I wrote. Next month we'll finish up recording. Really? The CD will be in stores on Passover. Then I'll have gigs and I'll be very busy. That's great. I also like Shlomo Artzi, the late Arik Einstein and Shiomi Shabat Shalom. It's not nice to behave like that towards a new friend. -Not your business. It is. - It's not! Stop everyone! People, that's enough. Eat your food. Here's to you. - Here's to you. Somehow I got used to his shenanigans. You're falling in love with him. He's so captivating, once you get to know him. I miss him already. Go ahead, ask me. - Ask you what? Why I left him. Okay. I'm asking. His mother and I were at odds even before he was born. As soon as we were told that he's... couldn't handle it. I just... Couldn't.. I was young, I would come home late at night. So as not to be home. After the divorce she moved away with Gadi, to be close to her family and... I admit, I was relieved. I was relieved. I paid child support and all, but... I didn't keep in touch. My daughter. Hi, sweetheart. Do you have a leave this weekend? Great, sweetie, I'm happy. Can I talk to you later? Okay, bye. Go ahead, ask me. I'm asking. That was my daughter, Liel. I'm a single mom. Reuven? Okay, begin. Aviram The entire battle you were on my mind. I'm glad you're home safe and sound. I love you. I love you too. Excellent, let's do that again. I wish you would have told me. No, no, no, no, no... I trust you, take care of it. I'm on the transplant committee too and I demand another discussion. No, listen, I trust you. You take care of it. Bye. Thank you for dinner. We must meet again soon. Gladly. You're sweating. You don't have a fever. No rest for the weary. - Right. Hello. No, no, no, no, that boy... "Pain has gone "Joy came instead "Two lovers met "Crying that hangs on happiness "Good to see you again, my love." Hello, Gadi, hi®w are you? What do you care? Listen, Gadi... Gadi? Gadi, what's going on? Gadi? They won't give me the food like I'm used to. The food is touching. - I'll call the director and tell her how you like yeur feed. I don’t want to work in their plastic factory. And working in the garage with all the noise and dirt is belter? The best. What's so good about the garage? You're there. Me? Adela and Rita and Dede and Meir and Nissim Ceramics... Dad? - Yes, Gadi. You're not thinking ©f killing yourself, are you? Why would you say such a thing? Gadi? Gaeli?

A mental star is born. What did you say? - Reuven, Reuven... What’s wrong with you?! Hey! Reuven! Reuven, calm down! - Dad! Dad! Dad! Let him go! What's wrong with you? Reuven? Reuven! Reuven, what’s going on? Someone call an ambulance. Dad, Dad.. Dad, Dad, Dad! Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance, now! Dad.. Why didn't you tell me anything? This is Dr. Huri. - Hello. You're my most disobedient patient. You don't come in regularly for dialysis and you're still smoking. I'm down to a pack a day. I hardly drink. - Abramov, your health is deteriorating, the dialysis is barely effective. You must come in 3 times a week. I can't do that. And we must consider a kidney transplant. There's a long waiting list and you may not hold out until then. What's your name? - Ella. Nice to meet you, I'm Gadi. - Ella... What is this? Ella, come with me. Can't you see he's retarded? I'm not retarded. I have special needs. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. He has good taste. Thank you. I want a bouquet for my father. That one. - That one? It costs 30 shekels. - 30 shekels. Oh no. What? - Do you have something for 20? Give me 100, I'll give you change. - No, no, no, no, no. Your son is a good soul. Why don't you want his kidney? - Shimon. You feel for him, but you're denying him a good deed. Shimon. - Saving one's father, is there anything greater than that? It's the ultimate.. It's... - Shimon. It's... - Shimon! Enough is enough. Gadi is the ideal donor.. Shimon, that's enough. Dad, what do I donate? I have money. - You don't have to donate a thing. I have lots of money. - Gadi, close the... Gadi, close the pouch and go call the nurse. You're doing this for him, huh? What do you think you’re doing? Let go. -Reuven! - Let go! Go to hell. Rita! The doctor said you mustn't smoke. Fine, I put it out. You see? Where did Rita go? Gadi, no one must know that I was in dialysis. Not even Ilana? No one. It's a secret. Mum's the word. Rita! Rita! It's so bland like this. I'll beyour donor. What type blood do you have? B, I think. No good. I have O. Why not Gadi? Absolutely not. - Why? I haven't given a rat's ass about him for 36 years and now I'll use him for replacement parts? What about Yehuda? - You know we're not talking. This is no time for petty squabbles, he's your brother. I told you a thousand times. - So you'd rather die and leave Gadi alone? I won’t call him. T's either him or Gadi. How do I look? Real handsome. Where are you going? I have a date. - With who? Yehuda. - Which Yehuda? Uncle Yehuda! Uncle Yehuda? I'm coming with you. - You barely remember him. Sure I do. He sent me gifts on my birthday. Yehuda sent you gifts? - Sure. I'm coming with you. - No, by the time you get dressed. I'm going alone. You wish. No! No! You're not coming with me! I'm going. Gadi. Gadi! You're not coming Uncle Yehuda! Gadi, what a surprise. Naomi, look who's here. Hi, Reuven, welcome. Hey... Aunt Naomi! What a palace. Right, Dad? Don’t ask what a hefty mortgage I took out. Wait, I'll close the door so the dog doesn't dirty the couches. How are your boys? Fine. Dad.. They're busy doing their own thing. You know how it is. Give me that. Thank you. No, I don't know how it is. Shall we sit down to eat? How's it going with the garage? I'm on dialysis. I go with Dad to the dialysis treatments. What's for dinner? I'm starving my ass off. Oh no. - Oh no... -Clean that up. It's Kroitzer parquet. It'll leave a stain. Kroitzer parquet. I'll help. - That's okay, sweetheart. I've got it. I'm a world champ cleaner. -Alright. - Too bad you didn't apply lacquer... Come, let's wash our hands. It’s expensive parquet... So she's tense. - I need a kidney right away. It's best the donor be a close relative. A son, daughter, brother, sister. We don't have a sister. Right. Can't the donor's blood pressure, glucose be an issue? The doctor said I don't have much time. Who's the doctor? Dr. Huri. An Arab? They say he's a leading specialist. You can buy a kidney these days. Really, I saw a show on TV. There are clinics next to the prisons in China where they... execute 10-20 people a day, and hop, organs go to transplants. How much does it cost? Around 150 thousand dollars. One week and you have a kidney in your hand. I'll get you a loan from my bank. I'll be your guarantor. What do you say? Another loan? I still have the loan I took out for the garage that I'm still paying because of you. 'Oadi, Let's go. - I want to eat! Forget that, lei's go! - Why are you leaving? Me, me, me... all you ever thought of was yourself. I need you to be a guarantor? Reuven. Dad used to say: "A monkey in a suit and tie is still a monkey." Goodbye, Gadi. Kroitzer parquet, my ass. Are you okay? I'm fine. Kroitzer. -Yes. You know what I heard? Without a donor, Reuven... Sshhh! Without' a kidney donation the man will die. What about his little brother? Cut it out! Rita, what were Meir and Nissim Ceramics talking about? What donation were they talking about? A transplant. - What's that? It's nothing. Tell me, tell me already! A person has organs in his body. If some break down, they can be replaced. Reuven's kidneys have broken down so he has to replace one of them. Like you replace a carburetor? Exactly. Without a carburetor the car won’t drive. Exactly. So now Reuven needs a kidney donation. Is my carburetor good, Rita? It's not a carburetor, Gadi. It's a kidney. Then I'll give him mine. I have two. Same as an Alfa Romeo. Don't tell him we talked about it, okay? It's a secret. Mum's the word, don't spill the beans... You promise you won't tell him? - Of course. Dad, who's that? A nice man. Okay, gotta go. Why doesn't he talk? Let's go. How are you, Gadi? Rita said I can give Dad my kidney. It's like replacing a carburetor. A carburetor... That's a good one, Reuven. A new carburetor or used in good condition? Gadi, that's enough. But why? That's enough. Why? - Because I said so. I want to donate my... - Didn't you hear me? Wouldn't you do it for me? It's out of the question. No! "It's out of the question..." The kid wants to, man. T's after one. Gadi. Gadi. Gadi! I'm not talking to you. It's after one o'clock, aren't you going to eat? I'm not talking to you. Why? You know why. Gadi. Gadi! Gadi, I want to talk to you... - No! Gadi, don't be a child. Gadi, come. I'll find a donor, don't worry. Mine isn't good enough! Of course you d©n't vyant it. Gadi. - It's not good enough... ’’Out of the questien." - GaojL It’s not out of the question! Why isn't Shimon here today? He returned his soul to the Maker. Bless his soul. He was here 2 days ago... He looked fine. He took a turn for the worse and his heart gave in. Shimon is dead? Shimon is dead. Where are you going, Gadi? - Shimon is dead... Gadi, where are you going? Reuven, you can't last like this. Take your son's kidney. Dr. Huri, Does he look like he has anything more to lose? Shimon is dead.. Shimon is dead.. Shimon... Shimon is dead. Shimon is dead. Shimon is dead, he's dead. Shimon is dead. He's dead.. Gadi, I made you breakfast. An omelet, just like you like. Gadi, this can't go on. You haven't taken your meds in 2 days, you'll have a seizure. You said so yourself. Gadi, I'm placing your breakfast by the door. Gadi, I'm going to dialysis, don't you want to come with me? Good bye. Reuven, do you have a minute? Come in, come in. Look, I’ve been thinking about it, the garage is a mess, there's only one working lift and that limits us. If we had another lift or two we could take on more clients and the output would grow, the turnover would grow, we could get a worker. I'll think about it... sometime. Reuven, this is the time. I'm even willing to invest. Then it won't all be on you, I'll take care of everything. Are you sure you're alright? Reuven. Don't you have a job? Okay, I... Gadi. Gadi. Gadi. Gadi, you didn't take your pills. Gadi. Thanks for coming. - Good evening, Reuven. I don’t know what to do, he hasn't taken his pills in a few days. - Where is he? In his room. I brought him chocolate, I'll try to talk to him. Gadi? Gadi, it's Ilana. I brought you chocolate. How about we go outside, we'll eat the chocolate, we'll talk, have something to drink. Say: "Juice to spice up the goose." Juice to spice up.. The goose. - The goose. Why is he shutting himself in? There must be a reason. It’s this thing with Adela, the waitress... He falls in love then he gets over it. Did you yell at him? Argue with him? Adela, the waitress, she has this thing with... Dede, my employee. Maybe 'be saw them together. Or maybe she rejected him and he took it too hard. You know this has nothing to do with Adela, right? Why won't he come out? - Nothing happened, what do you want?! So, we're arguing already? You shouldn't have troubled coming. Gadi, I'm leaving the chocolate. We'll talk tomorrow. "You have reached Gadi Abramov, singer and songwriter. "Please leave a message." Gadi? Gadi. Gadi, calm down, calm down. Do you hear me? Do you hear me, Gadi? Gadi, calm down, it will pass. Don't worry. Don’t worry, it will pass. I... I'm calling an ambulance, you'll be fine. Gadi. Gadi, calm down. Do you hear me? Gadi? Gadi. He must take his medication. If this happens again, go straight to the ER. Okay, thank you. Sign here. Thank you. Thank you. You're not allowed to smoke. No, no, I'm not... I've had this pack in my pocket forever. Dad. - What? I feel you’re not telling me the whole truth. I swear, this pack... I've had it in my pocket forever. Here. See? Don’t you want to live? Yes, I want to live. Then why don’t you want my kidney? You know what? We'll do a compatibility test. You're a match, you’ll donate your kidney to me and they'll transplant it in me. Very good, my friend. Don't bear to smoke. Bear? Dare. Bear. Dare smoke, don't bear smoke.. Let's go tomorrow to the beach. We'll drop everything and go. What do you say? . First a compatibility test. Ilana! Gadi. What are you doing here? I'm a matsh, I'm a match! - What? I will save my dad's life. - Wonderful. I’m giving him my kidney. Your kidney? - I have two. Where's your dad? Having dialysis. Bye. How could you? Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to, Ilana. You wanted to? I would have told you eventually. Reuven, what do you think will happen with you now? With Gadi? I don't know. - I'm on the transplant committee. I know. -A guardian can't take a kidney from his ward. You're putting me in an impossible situation. Ilana, you owe me nothing. Ilana. -I have to go. Dad, why is Ilana upset? She is not upset. Ilana.. Bring in the father and son. Nice to meet you, Mr. Abramov. I am Dahlia Barkan, I am legal advisor to the welfare bureau. This is Gili Ben David, the transplant coordinator and you both know Ilana. Of course we do. Okay. This is a report by National Insurance that I'm sure you're familiar with. "The test shows that the ward can barely tie his shoes." He was doing poorly back then. Mr. Abramov, if your son doesn't know how much 17 minus 4 is, if he can't state the name of the current prime minister... He's not into politics. He can't even tie his shoes? I can. The question is if he can make such a significant decision, if he understands the medical ramifications. So I lied. Excuse me? - I wanted another 1,000 shekels. Do I deserve to die because of that? Show them hew yeu tie yeur shoelaces., Show them. ' Mr.. Abramov, there's no need, really. There may be no need, but you brought it up... -Ilana, please. If he can tie up his shoes or not... - But it's the criteria of... His father... - "National Insurance"... I can. But I can! It's no problem at all. Okay, Gadi. Go ahead. 'Do you want to show us how you tie your shoes? Thank you very much. Restless again Tense and kicking It's that age Everyone goes through it Brush it off What's with you Mom is cooking for you So perhaps you should stop Fighting with the world And then you'll feel Much more sturdy 'Reuven, answer me. It's important. Ilana." Na na na.. That was wonderful. Absolutely charming. Don't worry, my friend. It will be fine. They will approve us. I'll make you some tea. Yes, Ilana. Okay... I understand. Okay. So we didn’t get approved. What can you do? They won’t let me give you my kidney? Dad? Ilana, let it go, there's no point. We weren’t approved? Dad? - We'll work it out. You'll see. It didn’t work out for Shimon.. His whole family prayed for him, you only have me to pray for you. What's wrong? Don’t worry, my friend, you’ll be fine. Dad. Get it all out, Dad. Thank you. You're welcome, my friend. Dad? Dad? - I have to go to the hospital, Gadi. Help me. - I'll help you. You'll be fine. Watch out, Dad, watch out. Dad, Dad, make a left! Dad, watch out for the posts! Dad, are you alright? Don't worry, you'll be fine. Watch out for the bus! We're almost there.. - Yes, yes. Here, at the gate. Open up! Open the gate! Open up! Over there, Dad, over there... Help me! Help me! My dad is very sick! Help me! Help me Dick him Sir, sit down here. Sit down, Dad... - Careful. Straighten the chair. Pick up your feet.. Pick his legs up. Gadi! I'm here, Dad, I'm here. Ilana, Dad is very sick. I must give him my kidney... Gadi, calm down. - Dad will die too. He will die! Gadi, where are you? - At the hospital. He will die! Help me, Ilana, I have to, I have to! Gadi, calm down. I'm with you. I'll handle this. You are wise, educated people, but I have deep thoughts too. Don't you understand that Dad will die like Shimon? Mom died from a truck and he's all I have. When I, was little, he left me' and Mom, but it's not because he's a bad person. I know him, he's a good person. I have special needs, but inside I'm as strong as a rock. And a strong person doesn't leave his dad when he's weak. And he's not only my dad, he's my best friend. And now he will die. I won't allow it. I won't allow it. I won’t allow him to die! Dede. How are you, Reuven? Here. Sign this. What is it? - Two jobs from today. If we had more lifts, I could do more, but it is what it is. So, how do you feel? So that's it? The garage will beclosed until I get out ®f here? Well then, I'm outta here. Gadi, bye, dude. Bye. Gadi, get me a snack from the machine. Which one? - Anything, as long as it's not salty. Do you know how to use the machine? Of course. Oops. You know, Rita, my lawyer drafted a will. Want some more to drink? I appointed you Gadi's guardian. Stop this nonsense. You're like a sister to him. I'm crazy about him, so what? You don't have children as it is. Reuven, stop, what's gotten into you? Are you still undergoing treatment? I don’t want to talk about it. How are you, my friend? How do you feel? Excellent, thank yo. isi-Me too. Ye-es! What a lie you going on about? Ilana. Congratulations. He needs some time alone. We’ll wait outside. This is where you say goodbye before going in separately. Gadi, next time you see your dad. Your carburetor will be in his body. If you don't assemble it well, you'll have to answer to me. Wait.. Ilana! How are you, uny hero? Samsen the Hero with his ass showing! Good luck. Thank you. Bye, my friend. Goodbye, buddy. Ilana, how about when I get out of here, we go to some restaurant? Something classy. I'll reserve a table new, so you don't change your mind. I won't change my mind. Good luck. Where's Dad? There's been a minor complication, but he's in good hands. Don’t worry. My carburetor is used, but in good condition. Let's be patient, Gadi. Dr. Huri. Rita, why are you crying? Gadi... Is Dad dead? Dad is dead. I won't see him anymore? "Glorified and sanctified His great name." - Amen. "In the world He created according to His will "May He establish His kingdom..." "May He establish His kingdom and may His salvation blossom and His anointed be near. - Amen. Amen. "and say Amen." - Amen. Just because the spirit In me, in my brain, in my soul Just because the spirit In me, in my blood, in my soul Me, you and God beside me will win It's not the brawn.. It's the spirit That pushes me from behind Just because the spirit In me, in my blood, in my soul It's the spirit In me, in my blood, in my soul That was excellent. Take a 10 minute break.
