(suspenseful music) (street sounds) (people chattering) (people speaking in Romanian) - I, uh. - He was asking if we had any family left in Romania. - You don't speak Romanian? - No, I don't, sorry. (driver speaking in Romanian) - Easy. (driver speaking in Romanian) - What did he say? - He said he hates you. (Julia laughs) - No no no. I say you are beautiful. (speaking in Romanian) - Thank you. (door bangs) (man sighs) (man speaking in Romanian) (siren blaring) (engine roaring) - Is this it? - I think so. (phone beeping) (speaking in Romanian) Julia! (speaking in Romanian) (woman sighs) (footsteps) Hey, not bad. (footsteps) (speaking in Romanian) - You don't like? - No, no. It's lovely. (speaking in Romanian) (door creaking) (speaking in Romanian) (door banging) (keys shuffling) (Francis sighs) (Julia laughs) - I smell like plane. - Oh, well, that's my favorite. Stale peanuts and sweaty strangers. - Why did she think I didn't like the place? - Because you smile too much. - Are you telling me that I walk around grinning like an idiot? - Only around me. (Julia chuckles) - You're insufferable. (suspenseful music) (rain pelting) - Can't sleep? - No. Sorry if I woke you. (blankets shuffling) (Julia sighs) When do you have to wake up tomorrow? - Early. - Wake me up before you leave, okay? - I will. (phone chiming) (Julia sighing) (phone chiming) (Julia chuckles) (soft upbeat music) - [Announcer] I am learning Romanian. (speaking in Romanian) She is a beautiful woman. (speaking in Romanian) She is a beautiful woman. (speaking in Romanian) I eat carrots. (speaking in Romanian) (woman screaming) I eat carrots. (speaking in Romanian) (woman laughing) (soft upbeat music) (street sounds) I would like to see a movie. (speaking in Romanian) Maria drinks coffee with her father. (speaking in Romanian) (speaking in Romanian) - (speaking in Romanian) Sorry. - No, your accent is great. (speaking in Romanian) (people chattering) (soft piano music) (engine roaring) (man speaking in Romanian) (suspenseful music) (footsteps) (keys shuffling) (speaking in Romanian) - I'm sorry, I don't understand. (speaking in Romanian) Okay. Thank you. (switch clicks) (door bangs) (Julia breathes heavily) (suspenseful music) (switch clicks) (switch clicks) - Hello darling. Any reason in particular you're standing in the dark? - Just people watching. How was work? - Exhausting, but good. Is this for me? - It's for you. It's kind of silly. - Yes, it is very silly. And I love it. (suspenseful music) For you. - What is it? - It's a symbol. - A symbol of what? - That's spring has arrived, isn't it obvious? (Julia laughs) (siren blaring) (footsteps) (people chattering) - What's happening? (speaking in Romanian) - I'm not sure. (people chattering) (siren blaring) (speaking in Romanian) (door creaks) Hey. - Hey, come look at this. (speaking in Romanian) - I think this is what we passed by the other night. (speaking in Romanian) What are they saying? (speaking in Romanian) - They're talking about the last time she was seen. - She was murdered? - So it seems. (speaking in Romanian) - That guy was there. What is he saying? (speaking in Romanian) - He found the body. - How did she...? (speaking in Romanian) - They didn't say. (speaking in Romanian) - They're gonna be here at 7:00. I can't figure out if Simion likes me, or he thinks I'm an idiot. I swear, every time I think I'm getting in with him, he shuts the door in my face like I'm Diane Keaton at the end of "The Godfather". Hey. - What? - What's up? - Nothing. (Julia sighs) There's this guy that lives across the street. And he's always looking over here. - 'Looking over here' How? - Every time I look over there, he's just standing in his window and it's like he's staring right at me. - Which window is it? - Right there. - I can't see anything. - Because it's day. - He only looks in at night? - I can only see him at night. It doesn't mean that he's not... You know what, forget it. - No, come on. If you're feeling uncomfortable about something, we should talk about it. - Really, I'm fine. So you're Diane Keaton now? - Mm-hmm, That's exactly what I said. (both laugh) (speaking in Romanian) - I'm sorry, I was just telling your husband that he needs some new accounts. What else do they have you on? - Frosty Cakes and some company that sells office supplies marketed towards women. - Oh, you just need to make a better impression on Simion. - Oh, that's a really good idea. Thank you. I hadn't thought of that. And don't confuse "a chinui" with "se chinui." (people laughing) - What happened? - Nothing, I just made this silly mistake earlier during a presentation and I'm never gonna hear the end of it. - He was trying to say to a client that he'd fight for them, but instead he said he'd torture them. (men laughing) - Is it okay if I smoke in here? - Julia gave up smoking a few months ago. - Really? - I don't see you as a smoker. - I'm trying not to be. - I don't have to. - No, no really. It's totally fine... - I don't wanna be a bad influence. - No, it's fine. - Thanks. - Francis told us you are an actress. - Oh yeah. I was... it wasn't really for me. So I'm... reevaluating.(chuckles) - Jules and I had an interesting experience the other night, didn't we? We're walking just a few blocks away we go past this crime scene, a bunch of cops. This afternoon we turn on the news and there it is! - What happened? - They found a woman murdered in her apartment. - You heard about it too? (speaking in Romanian) (men laughing) - Bullshit. - What? Do I need to leave so the grownups can talk? - They're saying the woman had her head cut off. - You didn't tell me that. - They didn't say anything about that. - It must be related to the other attacks. They found a woman about a month ago with her throat slit in her apartment around the same age. But this one he cut so deep it was essentially a decapitation! - They're calling him 'The Spider.' (speaking in Romanian) (speaking in Romanian) - Do you need help? - No no no, I'm fine. (speaking in Romanian) (door bangs) (woman laughing) (speaking in Romanian) (Julia speaking in Romanian) - You must be the new neighbor. - Oh yeah. (chuckles) - You two just moved in, right? - Yeah. - Can you hear me? - Yes, your English is perfect. - Thank you. But I meant, can you hear me inside my apartment? - Oh! No, not really. Can you hear us? - No, you're suspiciously quiet. And I love you for this. I'm Irina. - Julia. - Just bang on my wall if I'm ever making too much noise. - Okay. (siren blaring) (street sounds) (car honking) (speaking in Romanian) - I woke up and saw a man standing over me in the dark. (speaking in Romanian) - He put a pillowcase over my head. So I couldn't see his face. (speaking in Romanian) He held a knife to my throat and pressed down. (speaking in Romanian) I thought I was going to die because I felt it going into my skin. But then he stopped and just sat next to me, watching me. (speaking in Romanian) I felt like he was there for hours. (interviewee sobbing) I think he was watching me before. It just had a sense that, Someone was always behind me, even when I was alone. (suspenseful music) (silly music) (people clapping) (woman screaming) - Where is it, Lady? - [Woman] I don't know. - [Bad Guy] Give it to me. It's mine! (woman screaming) Peter! A man tried to kill me! (Men fighting) Peter? Peter? Peter, are you all right? (Man groaning) - [Man] Lock the door, don't let anyone in except me And close these windows after me. - [Woman] Be careful. - [Man] You just took the words right out of my mouth. (Theater seat bounces) (piano music) (footsteps) (door bangs) (street sounds) (speaking in Romanian) - No, I'm good. (suspenseful music) (announcer speaking in Romanian) (Julia panting) (glass shattering) (Julia screams) (door bangs) (Julia breathing heavily) (crunching glass) (eerie music) - Hey! (speaking in Romanian) - Is there a back door? (speaking in Romanian) (footsteps) (door bangs) - ...They're not committing to anything yet, but Simion says they like to be wooed. So we're going to headquarters in Sofia to do the whole song and dance. I don't know yet if it's gonna be Nicolae or me. - That's great. - You're not hungry? - Not really. This weird thing happened... There was this guy at the movie theater and then he followed me into the supermarket. - Followed you? - Yeah. - Did he say something to you? - No... (footsteps) - Did he follow you here? - No, I don't think so. - You okay? - Yeah. I think I just need to sleep it off. - Come here. The good news is, if he ever comes here, You have your big strong man to protect you. (Julia chuckles) Okay. I'm gonna pretend you didn't just laugh at that. - I'm sorry. - No... no, you don't have to apologize. - I don't know why I reacted like that. - I totally get it. Do you wanna go back to the supermarket? I mean, they gotta have security tapes, right? (speaking in Romanian) He thought you were trying to steal. - I wasn't trying to steal something. There was a man that was following me, I was just trying to hide. (speaking in Romanian) - What time were you in? - Around 4:00, I think. (speaking in Romanian) - What'd he look like? - He was white... older... He was wearing a brown jacket. (speaking in Romanian) - No. That's him. Okay, watch. Wait for it. Just wait. There, see? He's staring right at me. - Maybe, or... - Or what? - Or he's staring at the woman who's staring at him. (camera clicks) (eerie music) (utensils clanging) - You gonna be okay? - Of course, I'll be fine. - I have to go to a dinner with some clients tonight So I'm going to be out kinda late. - Okay. - Bye. (footsteps) (door bangs) (suspenseful music) (phone beeping) - Hey, I was just wondering when you're gonna be back home. Yeah, I figured. Do you know when you'll be back? No, I was just... No, it's fine. It's fine. Yeah, I'll see you when you're back. You too. (phone beeps) (eerie music) (door knocking) (door creaking) (speaking in Romanian) - I'm sorry, I don't understand. (speaking in Romanian) - Elvis? - Elvis! (speaking in Romanian) - It's her cat. - What? - Elvis is her cat. He' gone missing and she's trying to find him. And she wants to know if you've seen him. - I'm sorry. I haven't seen him. (woman sighs) (speaking in Romanian) - Poor Eleonora, that cat is always trying to escape her. - Thanks by the way. My husband usually translates, but still at work. - Working at 10:00 PM? Is he a stripper? - No. No. Works marketing. With a client. - Do you feel like coming in for a drink? I feel like another one and it's less sad if there's another person with me. - Yeah sure, sure! - Yeah, that sounds nice. - Okay. (door bangs) (keys shuffling) (footsteps) - Come in. - I should have stayed out longer, I look radiant with vodka! - Do you like port? - Yeah, sure. (speaking in Romanian) (speaking in Romanian) - See, you do! - I'm trying to learn. I wanted to surprise Francis, One day just say something, very casually. - So your husband's Romanian? - His mother is, but he grew up in the US. - And he brought you back to the home country. - Yeah. Got a promotion and they needed someone in the Bucharest office. - It must be hard for you though. It was hard for me when I first moved away. I studied ballet in London, before I injured my knee. My English was terrible. I fell madly in love with it eventually. But the first few months I was terribly lonely. Yeah, it can definitely be lonely. - At least you have your husband with you. I'm sorry. Did I say something to upset you? - No. - Are you sure? (door banging) - [Man] Irina! (speaking in Romanian) - Is everything okay? - Yeah. That's just my ex. - He sounds kind of scary. - He just sounds like that, it's all show. He's actually very sweet. Anyway, he knows not to cross the line. - And what if he does? (both laughs) - I'm serious. Open it. - Wow. - He gave it to me as a present when we were together to defend myself. I think he regrets it now, but it just makes it easier for me to tell him to go fuck himself. - I should tell more people to go fuck themselves. - You should! You should say (speaking in Romanian) (both speaking in Romanian) (Julia humming) (footsteps) (eerie music) - Fuck this. You're not really looking in here, are you? (keys jingling) - Jules? What's going on? - I saw the man in the window again. I waved at him. And he waved back. - Which one is it? - One floor up to the left. - His light's off. - He's in there. Don't! Do you see him? - Nah, I can't see anything. It's too dark. - I want to call the cops. Is that really necessary? - Yes. - So he followed you from the theater across the street to the market? - I think so. - You think so? (speaking in Romanian) Can you describe him please? - I have a photo. - So you think this is the same man you saw in the window? - I think it could be. - You could identify his face in a window in the building across the street? - Not exactly. It was dark. It was his silhouette mostly. - Mostly? - Look, this isn't normal. He's always there looking in here. I can feel him. - Okay. Okay. I'll go over there if you say he's looking at your window, that's not polite. So I'll talk with him. If you want, you can come with me, see if it's the same as in the picture? So I think so can become 'yes' or 'no.' - I don't think that's a good idea. - I'll go. I'd like to get a look at him. Maybe I could just hang back, get a glance of him around the corner, right? - Yeah, sure. (suspenseful music) (door knob clicks) - Was it him? Francis, was it him? - Listen to me for a second. Even if it was him, the guy lives in our neighborhood. It's not crazy to think that he'd be shopping at the same store. - I need you to stop rationalizing this all away. - You want me to stop being rational? To just jump to the craziest conclusion like you? - You think I'm crazy? - No, I think you're stressed and you're alone here all day long. You're in this new country- - Stop! Stop talking to me like I'm a fucking child! - I can't... I can't stay here. - Julia. - I wanna leave. - Leave like pack our bags right now? You wanna head to a hotel? Or you wanna get on a plane back to New York? Please just tell me what you want me to do. - I want you to fucking believe me! - Oh my God. This is just a bad night, Jules.. - It's not a bad night. I can't think here, I can't breathe. I feel like I'm losing my mind. - What can I do? What can I do to help? - Nothing. (sighs) (door bangs) - Hey, Jules. I'm heading out. (street sounds) (eerie music) (dog barking) (water dripping) (suspenseful music) (speaking in Romanian) - Do you speak English? - Yes. - What is this place? - Museum. - It's a museum? - No, 'Museum.' It's a club. - Can I go in? - Yeah, sure. (club music) (creepy shuffling) (mop bucket splashing) (eerie music) (glass knocking) - Julia? (lighter clicks) You followed him here? - Francis thinks that I'm overreacting, but he's been watching us since we moved in. Do you know him? I think he works here as a cleaner. - People come and go here all the time I never really get a good look at their faces. They all have the same dumb expression and they start to blend together. - Have you noticed anyone watching you in your apartment? - No, but maybe I've gotten used to having eyes on me. - Do I just sound paranoid? - Let's just hope you'll never find out. The best outcome might be having to live with the uncertainty, better than getting raped and strangled and dying with the words I told you so on your lips, right? (man speaking in Romanian) Sorry, I have to get back to work. Thank you for looking after me. I'll try and do the same for you. (toothbrush scratching) (water splashing) - [Host] They use olive oil, But I like to use butter. - [Guest] Oh really? - [Host] Yes, no butter is very-- (footsteps) (Julia screaming) (thump on wall) (wall knocking) - Irina? (Door knocking) Irina. Irina! (knob clicking) (door knocking) (speaking in Romanian) - I heard yelling! I heard screaming from in here, okay? (speaking in Romanian) If we can just get the key. He's hurting her, okay? Can we get the key, please? (people speaking in Romanian) Just open the door, please! (people speaking in Romanian) (woman speaking in Romanian) - I heard the screaming from the bedroom. (footsteps) (eerie music) (speaking in Romanian) - Elvis, Elvis! (speaking in Romanian) - What did she say? - She said she didn't want tenants who created trouble. - I can imagine. - I'm sorry I've been working so much. - It's your job. - I know, but you moved here to be with me. - Well, that's presumptuous. Maybe I've always wanted to live an aimless existence in Bucharest, smoking cigarettes and scaring my neighbors with my hysterics. - You thought she needed help, I don't blame you for it - I gotta go into work for a few hours today, but we have cocktails tonight, if you're up for it. - Yeah, I'm good. (speaking in Romanian) - I was wondering if you knew a woman that works there, her name is Irina? She didn't come home last night and I was just wondering if you've heard from her or seen her? Okay. All right. Thank you. (phone beeps) (door knocking) Are you looking for Irina? - You know where she is? - No. I just saw her last night at work. - We were supposed to meet at my apartment after she finished. - She never came? - It's not the first time but, no, she never came. - Do you know where she would be? - [Man] Think she's inside. - I don't think so. I would have heard her come in. Do you have her phone number? - Yeah, but she doesn't answer me. - Do you mind if I try and call her? - Yeah. (phone ringing) You hear that? (door knocking) (speaking in Romanian) - Wait, could you help me with something? (eerie music) - So you want me to knock on his door and get the guy to come out? - Yeah, I just need to see him. - Why? - I think that he's been following me. The police say they can't do anything, but I need to know for myself that it's the same person. - Fucking cops are useless. (elevator dings) So which one? - That's the corner... Four doors down. - On the left? - Yeah. (door knocking) - I think there is someone inside, but they don't answer. (phone ringing) (speaking in Romanian) Sorry. I gotta go. - Can you just try one more time? - Okay. (footsteps) (door banging) (speaking in Romanian) Sorry, I tried. - What did you say? - To stop bothering you. But don't worry. He probably has a little crush on you. (phone ringing) If you see a Irina, can you tell her that I came by? - Okay. - (speaking in Romanian) (eerie music) (door knocking) (door creaks) (speaking in Romanian) - I'm sorry, sorry. (eerie music) (elevator clanging) (Julia breathing heavily) (door knocking) (knob clicks) - Julia? - Julia, this is Daniel Weber. He lives in the building across from you. Mr. Weber made a complaint with us today about a neighbor who has been harassing him. - [Francis] Harassing him? - Yeah, looking at his window, following him around, showing up at his door and threatening his father. And I remember Mr. Weber from your complaint and I wanted to resolve this before it goes any further. So if you both can agree that this was misunderstanding and that it's not gonna go in and further, we can all go on with our lives. (speaking in Romanian) (eerie music) - Let me know when they're gone. (door shuts) - You okay? I saw this today... - What is this? - It says they caught The Spider. Remember the guy who found her? He was a plumber. Did a job for the last victim. They found a bunch of her clothes in his apartment. He'd already been in prison for rape. (suspenseful music) Simion, my wife, Julia. - She's as beautiful as you described her, Francis. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - We were just talking about the big news. - Did Francis get a promotion? No, no. They caught The Spider! - So Francis and Julia live near one of the victims. So they saw the crime scene. - We just walked past really. That's all. (speaking in Romanian) - Francis said that you were having some trouble with one of your neighbors? Maybe it was him! - Can you imagine. (laughs) (speaking in Romanian) (people laughing) (speaking in Romanian) - What did you just say? - It's just a stupid work joke. - What did he say? - Jules, come on. - No, no really. It was just some office gossip. - How about more champagne? I need a refill. - At least I have The Spider to... to what? - Julia! - At least have The Spider to 'keep me company?' Is that...? At least I have that. (glass shattering) - Julia, where are you going? Will you please stop? - What? I can't take a joke? Is that what you're gonna tell me right now? - I don't know what to do anymore, Julia. I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling like this because you can't let go of some fucking fantasy. (Julia sobs) (sad music) (street sounds) (footsteps) (metal clanging) (footsteps) (man coughs) (train roaring) (metal clanging) (engine roaring) (man speaking in Romanian) (announcer speaking in Romanian) (announcer speaking in Romanian) - It's probably an animal. - What? - The cause of the delay. It could be signal problem or repairs or sometimes it's because an animal is on the tracks. There could be a couple subway workers chasing a dog as we speak. - So how long does it take? - To catch a dog? Not long, if you're fast. Usually just takes a few minutes. Even if it seems longer. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Why are you following me? - I don't control the trains. Let me explain. I spend all day looking after my father, he is very sick. And so sometimes I go to the window and just look at people going about their day. I know it is sad hobby, but no one has really noticed before. I've really become sad old man now, I thought, dreaming up a pretty girl who's finally looking back at you. But then you waved. And I thought that you were saying hello. That's why I was so surprised when your husband came to my door with the police officer. I did not understand what I had done that was so bad. And why you kept following me. I wondered if you were trying to embarrass me, or if you were trying to scare me when you came to my door with that man and cursed at my father. I had hoped that after I involved the police, that would be the end of it. But I felt that what I really needed was an apology. - I'm sorry. (announcer speaking in Romanian) (doors sliding) (Julia panting) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (door bangs) (shoes thud) (suit case clicking) (music playing behind wall) (door bangs) (music playing) (door knocking) Irina? (door knob clicks) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (Julia pants) (Julia screams) (gasping) - Be careful about breathing too hard. I left enough holes for you to get air, but you will pass out if you start to hyperventilate or scream. - Help. Help! - Irina screamed. We had to hide in that closet while you were all looking around. For a moment I was sure that you'd seen me. Imagine how awkward that would have been. (plastic shuffling) (Julia sobbing) - [Francis] Julia? - Help! (Julia gasps) (Julia screams) - Fuck. (eerie music) (Julia gasps) (Julia sobs) (somber music) (water splashing) (phone ringing) (gun bangs) (Weber groans) (gun bangs) (Weber groans) (child crying) (door knob clicks) (people speaking in Romanian) (Francis sighs)
