Subtitles by explosiveskull It's our first time working for Jerrell. You know we gotta do this right. Stay focused. Get off the 'gram, pay attention. I got all these chicks on Instagram. Look at this shit, dawg! Yo, I ain't got time for that shit. You sound like a whole nut ass nigga! How I be a nut ass nigga? 'Cause you ain't focused! I'm focused on that ass right... Yo, yo, wait.

You ain't even did nothing yet! Yeah, but this is crazy! Man, listen. This shit, too easy. Sweet as hell. These niggas ain't built. They ain't built like nothing. So relax. Toughen the fuck up. And pick your gun up. Damn, baby! What's going on, baby? You need some oil? You need a mechanic? I know... - Get the fuck down! - Ooh, you dirty bitch! - Right now. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Dumb ass bitch! That's for Quadir, motherfucker! Come on! Hurry your ass up! I don't know if I'm calling him no more, girl. You know, like. He kinda look like he got a wooden leg and stuff. - Hey, Gena! - Hey, Alia. Girl, I ain't calling him no more. His breath stink. Mm-mmm. What time did you leave last night? 9:00, maybe 10:00. And you've been working here how long? I don't know. Ten months now. All right, so you've been doing all that, what, 10 months, and you don't even like this job? Okay. Gena, I'm hoping you consider us friends 'cause I'm just gonna be direct. I don't know what you're running from, what you're trying to forget, but if you don't resolve the issues that you have you're gonna run into a brick wall. I don't have any issues. Oh, yeah, right. I mean, every woman your age would love to just work 16 hours a day, not hanging out with her friends, and go to parties, or be with her boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend either. Then maybe you should get one. That's offensive. Then call the labor board. Two weeks off, mandatory vacation. You can't make me take a vacation. You know, this is something you probably don't know about me, but back in the day when I was a DJ, I used to say "You ain't gotta go home, "but you've got to get the hell up on outta here!" I'm serious. Take the time off. Just find some peace. See you in two weeks. Take the GPS's off of these two and we're done. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. Look, I know things got hectic out there, but you stood tall. I appreciate that. Just ain't never seen nobody get shot before, let alone die. Welcome to the big league, baby girl. What we about to do with all these drugs? We are gonna break them down, and we gonna hit these streets. - For real? - For real. It's about to be an early Christmas in the hood, baby girl. Let's do it, then. What's up? Yeah, yeah! Philly's finest is definitely in the building! And then there's this nigga. Good news is I heard you had insurance. Y-You okay? I appreciate your concern... I don't give a fuck about you. You know what didn't have insurance? My shipment you was transporting. Saleem, how much was that shit worth? It's a meal ticket. A fucking meal ticket. Nigga, that's $1 million of my money. I got you. How the fuck you got me? Huh? The fuck does that mean? On the real, they came outta nowhere. It's like they knew what we had and where we was going. She said it was for Quadir. The fuck you just say to me? She said, "This for the boy, Quadir." That's impossible. Quadir Richards is dead. And I know this because I killed him. So you know what? Titus, we're gonna just chalk this whole thing up as a bad first date. - Tracy. - What's up? Can you give me the room, please? All right, I'll be in the car. I saw one of 'em. Speak up. I saw one of their faces, and I recognized the bitch, too! Why the fuck didn't you just say that? Come on, Titus, you gotta be smarter than that, man. You almost got yourself fucked up for no reason. Find out who the fuck he saw and get back to me ASAP. All right. I got you. Keep talkin'. Girl, you are gonna live forever. I was just thinking about you. Oh, my God. I literally was just telling my homegirl on the other line how you doing big things up in New York at that fashion magazine! Yeah, living my best life. So what do they got you working on now? Um... I'm on vacation. Vacation? Must be nice. So, are you gonna come home for Quadir's memorial? How do you know about Quadir's memorial? - Shoog told me. - Shoog? What you doing talking to Shoog? She calls and checks on me from time to time. What's wrong with talking to Shoog? It ain't nothing wrong with talking to Shoog, but you ain't got nobody your own age you can talk to? Yeah, but they don't know nothing. Shoog be putting me up on game. Where is Gah Git? She's on the phone talking to your daddy. Oh, wait, hold up. She's hanging up now. Oh, my goodness, was that Gena? Tell her I wanna talk to her! Now you know she don't talk on cellphones though. Yeah, 'cause it cause cancer. Oh, my God, do you hear her? Yeah, I heard her. Just tell her I'mma call her on the landline. All right. How you doing, baby? I'm good. I was just talking to your daddy. And he told me to tell you hello and, uh, he's getting out on parole. Good for him. Oh, baby, now don't be talk like that. God don't like ugly. How else am I supposed to be? Baby, listen. Matthew's 18:21. "Lord, how many times am I supposed to forgive my brother "who sinned against me? "Seven times?" And you know what Jesus said? He answered, "No, not seven times, "70 times seven." That's why you need to go see your daddy, so you can have closure. I'm good. You can handle that. Oh, Lord Jesus. Baby, listen. I hope you're gonna come on home for Quadir's memorial. You come on home to your Gah Git. I do-I don't know, Gah Git. It's just, you know, the memories. Sahirah... Lita... ...my mom, Quadir. I feel like I just wanna go somewhere I can disappear. Baby, trust me, I understand. But sugar, I want you to understand something, too. Quadir is in your heart and in your soul. So wherever you go and no matter what you do, he's gonna always be with you, baby. All right, I'll talk to you later, Gah Git. I love you. I love you, too, precious. A writing opportunity? Hmm. Hey, girl. Yo, I can't believe they really killed Moot and Taj. I sorta knows. I can't believe you was with them. What's this? I saw an opportunity with Shoog, and I took it. Oh, so you hustlin' now? Yeah, I was born with a little hustle in my heart. Larceny, too, obviously. But this ain't you. What you gonna do with it? I was thinking you could help me move it. I mean, you got all them tricks and stuff that be coming in... Clients. I'm a massage therapist. All right, and I'm a damn astronaut. Nah, but for real, I'mma kick you 10% of whatever you sell. Thirty percent. Twenty. Twenty-five. Deal. Welcome to the space program, bitch. Long time no see! What the fuck, man? I'm out the game. It's like a boa constrictor. The more you struggle, the tighter that shit gets. Now tell me who the fuck took my shit. Tell me what the fuck I need to know! I don't know what the fuck you talking about, man. You killed Quadir, man. You won. I'm out of the game. I let you live, and you can keep living if you tell me who the fuck hijacked my shipment. Four women. Who were they? The fuck make you think that's my business? Because they said Quadir Richards sent them. And you're the last nigga living of Quadir's crew. So who the fuck was it? I'm telling you I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I don't think you understand the magnitude of this situation. I've got people to answer to. And if I don't get my shipment back, somebody gotta pay for it. So gimme some names. Who the fuck was it? I'm telling you I don't fucking know. You got one more chance, nigga! I don't know shit! Well, congratulations. You about to be famous. Time's up! ...correctional facility. Press five to accept. What up, T? You ain't out here trying to be a college nigga and shit still, is you? Shit. Better than these streets, I can tell you that much. What's good? Be real with me, bro, 'cause I'm hearing shit. What's up with this nigga Saleem? He really fuckin' y'all up right now. He got your whole operation hot as fuck. I'm not trying to come home to no crazy shit. It ain't got shit to do with Saleem. Saleem earned his position while you were away. So, I need you to let that shit go. I'll fill you in when you get out. Yeah, well it might be sooner than you think, bro. I just talked to the appeal board, and shit, I might be up out of here less than a week. Nigga, you lying. Fuck, man. That's... That's the best news I've heard all week. Yeah, me too, nigga. Best news I heard, too. Just let me know when you need me to scoop you up. Nah, for real I'mma need you. Hell, yeah, how the fuck else am I gonna get from up here. And I'm hungry as hell, too. First stop, Tootsie's and a water ice. I love you, boy. I love you, too. Nigga, stay up. So, what we look like? Shit's quiet. What that mean? I'm saying niggas is thirsty. Everyone's tryin' to re-up. So what you tell them? Told 'em I'd get back to 'em. You said it like that? Or you said it like we got some shit coming down the pipeline? Or did you say it like we ain't really got nothing for 'em? I just said it. Why, what's up? We've got about two more weeks before we run dry, then we're outta business. If the streets find out that we're out-out, the wolves are gonna scoop up all our regulars. And I didn't take out Quadir and his crew to lose one inch of territory in this city. Plus on top of that, we've gotta replace that shipment. The ticket's about to be due on that shit. So, I really need you to think about it. Who in Quadir's crew would have the balls to hijack my shit? Rasun. No. Rasun's no longer with us. Everyone knows he's putting in work with the Mexicans out in Cali. No. The Mexicans is global. They ain't worried about us in Philly. Who owes us money? Jordan, he's a month behind, but it ain't the first. Go see him. You want me to get heavy or just talk? I don't give a fuck if you throw him out the window. Just get my bread. Matter of fact, go and collect from anybody that owes me. No excuses. All right, I'll go see him. And call up Vaughn, too. Tell him I wanna meet with him. We'll cop from him in the short term until I figure out this hijacking shit. Who got Quadir's bank when I knocked him off? I don't know. His moms and his pops got his property, though. No. They ain't even in the game. They wouldn't know where to start. You know niggas on the streets probably kept everything they owed once you knocked him down. Yeah, I know, but Quadir had M's. Who would he trust with that kind of cash? The real money. Gena Rollins. Quadir's ghost wanna take food outta my mouth? We'll see if he returns from the grave when I do the same to her. 'Scuse me. Come in. Venus Nielson, right? Yes. Please, have a seat. Thank you. And thank you for coming in on such brief notice. Absolutely. Well, let's get straight to it. I have something that I think will be really good for you. What's that? So, we do articles on icons and global influencers. And we were hoping that you would do a piece on millionaire entrepreneur, Carlos Sanchez. He's at the forefront of branding and distribution for cannabis in California and in every... Yeah, yeah, I know exactly who he is. Okay, good. So, our company has been tracking your writing for a few months now, and we would love for you to go to LA and do an interview on Carlos and a five-page article. Me? Five pages? In LA? Yes, you ever been to the West Coast? Yes, I have. Did you like it? "Like" is an understatement. It's probably the best time I've ever had in my life. Okay, so good. This shouldn't be a problem. Not at all. We'll pay you a stipend of $100 per day, an Airbnb. I'll send you all the information via email, and let me know when you get there. Sounds good. Say, boss, you know the word is on the street they got booked for a ticket out in Philly, right? Happens to the best of us, bro. What up, Vaughn? The cost of living. Didn't expect you to drive to New York yourself for this little bit of work like this, man. I was just in the city for a little business, figured I'd pay you a visit. We good? Yeah, we Gucci. This stays between me and you, right? Who the fuck I'ma tell? Say less. - All right. - My man. Don't call me when you count that shit. Oh, you know somebody will. Excuse me, mami. Whatever he wants, it's on me. All right, look. When you get back to the city, anybody runs dry? That shit oughta hold them over. Back to the city? You're not rolling with me? Nah, I'ma stick around New York. See if I can find Quadir's bitch. Rumor has it she's sitting on a pot of gold, and nigga, I needs to find out 'cause I need that money. Hold up, wasn't she there when you downed him? She never saw me. This nigga was playing Captain-Save-A-Hoe and pushed her to the ground before I started letting off. Get down, get down! All she know, I could be having a cup of coffee with her, and she'd never know that I was the nigga that killed her man. You a wild bull. - I appreciate that. - Real one. Yeah. Hmm. But check this out, all right. I need you to hit the streets. I mean hit the motherfuckers hard. We gotta find those bitches that took my shit, you feel me? Matter of fact, they're supposed to be throwing a memorial service or some shit for Quadir. I need you to pull up. See if they show up to that. This nigga dead and they still celebrating him? Fuck that nigga still. I'm out. You don't want a ride back to the hotel? Nah, I'm good. It's New York City. I'ma hit the ground real quick. What's up? I'm looking for Lucy. I'm Lucy. A friend of mine said you have some paperwork ready for me. Friend got a name? Black. New York Black or LA Black? Miami Black. Yeah, David James. Why David? Because David slayed Goliath. All right, Miss Lucy, so I need your help with two more things. Talk to me. Hey, Bria. Hey, what you doing? You on your way? Well, there's been a slight change in plans. Wait, so you're not coming? No, I'm still coming, but I got an opportunity in LA, so I'ma go there first. LA? Okay, you big poppin'! Well, okay, that's cool. Well, you know I was just coming to Philly 'cause I had to drop something off, but it's better this way 'cause now I can spend more time with you. Facts. Well, just call me whenever you land, all right? Okay, all right. I love you. Love you, too. I can't believe you're actually going to drive to California. It's not exactly right around the corner, you know. Well, I mean, I got an opportunity, so I'm gonna hit the road. I get it. Okay. Um, well, bless you. And are you sure that you're not forgetting anything? Yeah, everything is mapped out in my phone, and I text you my address just in case there's an emergency. These bags? I'm taking them? Oh, no, it's okay. I got these. All right. I'll see you in a couple weeks. See you in a couple weeks. Yeah. Let's go. Morning, may I help you? Hi, I'm calling from Winston's Flowers, and I have a delivery for Gena Rollins, but I'm a little confused about your address. Oh, wow. Look, unfortunately, she's not gonna be here for another few weeks. Oh, these will be dead by then. And they're so beautiful. Two dozen Juliet roses. Why you don't just go to her apartment? Um, sure. What's her address? Oh, God. Hold on, lemme get that for you. I'm gonna get one of them. Girl, why you messing around in my kitchen like this? I'm sorry, I'm hungry. I was about to go get me something to eat 'til you gave me with that 911 call to get over here. I've got some baked chicken on the stove and some broccoli and some mashed potatoes, and it be ready in a few minutes. Now that's what I'm talking about. Let me get my hot sauce, yeah. So what's going on? Lord Jesus. - What's the matter? - I'm worried about Bria. Bria? What'd she do? It ain't any one thing, but she got this air of disrespect. She been disrespecting you? Not per se, but I did have to use my hands on her - a few weeks ago. - Oh, Gah Git. You can't be laying your hands on these kids nowadays. It ain't like when we was growing up. You could go to jail. I know that, I know. I ain't trying to go to jail, baby. Lord. And that's why I've been trying to just keep this level of restraint since then, but I don't know how long I can keep this up. That's why I want you to talk to her 'cause you two are tight. That's true. Where's she at now? Say she in the gym, but there ain't no telling. Shoog, please talk to her? Know what's crazy? What? She asked me to talk to you about being overly protective... - Get out. - ...but she didn't nothing about you laying no hands on her. And she better not either 'cause if she know what's good for her... Stop that. I know I ain't supposed to be saying stuff like this... But, girl, I'm worried. Worried about her. I don't want her to go down the same path as Gena. Speaking of Gena, how is she doing? I've been meaning to call her. She in California, working. Say she don't ever want to come back to Philly 'cause of all the bad memories. And I'm worried about her. I don't wanna lose Bria like I lost Gena. Especially now that she got that new boyfriend. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm gonna talk to Bria for you. You gonna see. Okay. Gimme a hug. Oh, thank you, girl. - Mm, mm, mm. - It's gonna be all right. Need your help. Now fix me something to eat! - Oh, child, please! - Thank you. I'm gonna make you... It's my pleasure! - I like dark meat, okay? - Okay, I know. Babe! Remember when we first hooked up? And I told you I wasn't looking for anything serious? Yeah, you said you didn't want a relationship. Look I'm still with that, but if whatever reason we wanted to modify that. Modify? Like, if one of us got in our feelings and thought that maybe we should make our relationship exclusive. Look, I think it's worth a try. So you're saying that you're into your feelings and you wanna be exclusive? I'm telling you I'm keeping it 100 with you and let you know where I'm at with everything. Hmm, nice. So nice that you'd wanna be exclusive? No, nice that you're keeping it 100. Damn. That's it? I mean, I was feeling like we was all good, but now I'm not too sure. Wait, wait, wait. What happened? What's going on? My grandmother is blowing up my phone. Besides, I don't have time to be complicating myself with all these extra feelings and shit. Look Bria, I don't know what happened, but I like you, all right? And I like you, too. And if you want to kick it, I'm with it. But all this extra shit, I don't have time for it. Okay, I'm sorry, um... We can kick it. I'll hit you up when I wanna kick it again. Fuck. Oh, what's going on, man? Forgot your umbrella, huh? Yeah! No, actually, I was coming to meet my cousin, Gena Rollins. Have you seen her around? Oh, no, she, took off. She's driving to LA. She already went to LA? She's on her way. Oh, crap. And my cell phone is completely dead. Can you be a good friend and help me out? Uh, otherwise I'll be lost. Okay. Do you need, uh... I mean, I have her itinerary, if you... Would you? Yeah, message would be a lifesaver. I hate to do this to you, but I don't have my glasses... - Yeah, that's fine. - ...so if you could just read that. - Yeah, of course. - Okay. Cool. 20928, Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu. - Thanks a lot, buddy. - All right, yeah, you got it. - Okay, tell her I said hi. - Will do. All right. Uh... Gena's cousin, right? Yeah, on her dad's side. Wassup? Yo, I put everything in play like you said, but everyone's still on edge. It's Philly. People are born on edge. Yeah, but the police is harassing the trap houses, asking about Rasun. They just going through the motions, trying to justify they paychecks. I know, I know. But I think it'd put everyone at ease if you slide through. That ain't gonna happen. I'm in LA, blending in with the Cali folks. LA? I just left you in New York. What are you doing in LA? Gena Rollins. Gena Rollins? You really don't think she's got bread, do you? Well, let's see, She been working for an online magazine for a year, but she lives on Park Avenue and drives a Range Rover. What do you think? You think she got a sponsor? Nah, she doesn't really give me that vibe. Now you got a vibe on her, huh? Nigga, I ain't out here for shits and giggles. What you working on? Just tying up some loose ends with Jordan. I just found out where they're doing the memorial at. I got eyes all over it. All right. Let me know what you find. All right, I will. I'll holla at ya. All the bedrooms have the exact same view. Mesmerizing, isn't it? It's incredible. Glad you like it. The key, garage door opener, - and my card in case of an emergency. - Okay. Oh, and there's a store five minutes up the way if you need groceries. Okay. So, what do you do for fun around here? I personally play volleyball. Volleyball? I haven't played volleyball since I was in high school. Really? Well, if you haven't played volleyball in a bikini on the beach next to the Pacific Ocean, then you really haven't played the way it's meant to be played, now have you? - Is that right? - Yeah. If you're interested, let me know. I stay just up the road. 'Kay. Uh, want help with your bags? Oh, no, it's fine. Okay, well, call me if you need anything. Will do. Thanks, Mark. Looking back to see how far I've come. I fight to overcome the struggles of my past. Every reflection is a lesson you seek. It's the whispers that the universe will speak. So rise to you, rise to your truth, rise and be true. Mm. That feel good? Yeah, feels good as fuck. You got a lot of tension in your neck. You want me to relieve that for you? Turn around. So, what's all the stress about? Can't be that bad. Me and my mans got hit for every bit of coke we had. Is that bad enough? Maybe I was wrong. Y'all know who did it? All we know is that it was just a bunch of bitches. Bitches? Like girls? Is there any other kind? Shit. I ain't even worried about it. We gonna figure it out like we do everything else. But what I do know, some bitches and their family, they gonna feel it, and that's on God. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ How sweet the sound That's her right there! You sure?

I saw you out there! - You killed it! - Whatever. Hey, I'm sorry about the guys. They get overly competitive. They're just dicks. No, it was fine. No, really. I had a really good time. - Yeah? So did I. - Yeah. But... just so we're clear, just... know I'm not a dick like those guys. No, you're not a dick. In fact, you were a perfect gentleman. - Yeah. - Thank you. - I had a great time, though. - Me, too. Thank you. Thank you. So... Do this again soon? - Sure. - Yeah? But, I pick the sport this time. Perfect! Bowling, I love it. Bowling? I'm good at bowling. No. Thank you. I'll see you soon. See you. So, you're sure? The same chick from the picture is the same girl that robbed us? A hundred percent. They was all at the memorial together. You saw them at the church together? Yeah. It was a nice memorial, too. There was a couple of celebrities in there. Faith, Stevie James... All right. All right, nigga, I got the point. But, we still don't know who the third chick is, right? Nah, the old chick was like old-old. And Gena used to live with them. It's her cousin and her grandmother. I think Gena set the whole thing up. See, you was right to follow her out to L.A. Well, find out who the third chick is before you make any moves. We don't wanna scare 'em away. All right, bet. All right. I'll hit you back. You don't know Gena Rollins. Excuse me? Who are you? It's not important. What is important is that you do exactly what I'm asking you. You don't contact her. You don't text her. You don't know her. Understand? Look, I don't know you. The last time I checked this was America... I'm only gonna ask you this one more time. Stay the fuck away from Gena. I'll do whatever I want. Stay the fuck away from Gena! You wanna talk shit? Tell me what the fuck you gonna do, huh? Stay the fuck away from her! Fuck, man! Stop! You gonna kill me? Look. If you in the trunk, you pretty much dead, already. What you punishing me for? Punishing? I can get medieval. But I... Look, check this out. You got two options. Life... Okay! Okay! Bria wasn't even really checking for me! She was using me for sex and food and whatever! For the right price I'll push that skinny bitch off the bridge. What's up? Shit. Obviously not you. Who's got eyes on the girl? I got Titus and Big Man watching Bria and Alia 24 seven. They gonna hit me if they make a move. Bria lead you to the other chick yet? Nah, she just be kicking it with this young bull, Dalvin. He just be playing ball and selling weed. Anything heavy? Nah, he trying to move up in the game, but the boy ain't got no heart. We could snatch her ass up and make her tell us who the other chick is. Or you could end up scaring her away. Listen to me, Saleem. When we hit 'em, we're gonna hit 'em all at once. So, chill the fuck out, nigga. No loose ends. Right. How's it looking on your end? Shit. It's looking all right. I talked to her today. Sounds like you feeling her. Nigga, ain't nobody feeling nobody. I'm just trying to get in good with her till I get the money. Once I get my eyes on it, it's lights out for her. So, don't be trying to fucking play me. - I was just saying. - Don't just say shit. Matter of fact, nigga, how about less fucking and more work? Get your ass in them streets. Find that shit out. All right. Fuck out of here. Yes, we do to-go's. Sure. Two cokes. - Hi. - Two with no cheese. Hey, how you doing? Can you give me one second, please? Sure. Two cokes. Okay, it'll be ready in ten minutes. What name should I put the order under? Okay, thank you. I'll see you in ten minutes. Good day. How are you doing? How may I help you? Yeah, I called in an order for Gena. One second. - Gena Rollins? - Yes. Right here. That will be $14.33. Oh, I paid for it by credit card over the phone. Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd think that you were following me. Gena, right? Yeah. David? Yeah. You got any bad guys you need me to run away? - Nah, I'm good. - You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. But I will tell you, you guys in LA, you're a little different. No. Not all guys in LA are the same. And I would love to show you that if you just use the number on that card I gave you. Offer still stands. You know, I just might hold you up on that offer. All right, I just might like that. - Okay. - Okay. Well, you have a nice day. You do the same... Gena. David. Mr. Sanchez? Gena Rollins. It's so nice to finally meet you. I admire all of your accomplishments. Such a pleasure. Did you get everything you needed? Yes, I did. Danielle e-mailed me everything. Then, I guess we're good. Would you care to join me? Sure. Okay, recording. So, what prompted you to become so heavily involved in the cannabis business? I think I answered that question in the press package Danielle has sent you. Yes, but it was because of your support that the law was passed, right? I'm sure I answered that, as well. Okay, so you were born poor in Mexico. What was... Let's not talk about these nonsense issues, huh? Ask me what you want to ask me. I'm sorry? You're a nonsense issue? Everyone knows. I'm rich, I'm powerful. Ask me what you want to ask me. I knew Quadir. You knew Quadir. My Quadir? I've always wanted to meet the captivating young lady that won the heart of my dear friend. God rest his soul. But how? Why? I don't understand. Quadir was a very good friend of mine. The last time I saw him was the last time you two were in California. I'd never seen him so happy. He was a good man. So that's why I'm here? Yes. To ask questions that I might have answers to. Help you fill in the blanks. To ease your mind with any information that I might have about him. Have you been sending me packages? And I'm not talking about the press packages. Why am I here? What do you mean, why you here? Because you are the man of the hour, Titus! It's a big day for you, man. A big day for you. You're doing big things in the street, huh? Yeah. You know, what I can't seem to understand for the life of me is how you fuck up a drug deal like you did so royally and don't have the good sense to get the fuck out of Philly. Fleeing the scene of a crime! You know, he's really right. He's right, Titus. And you know what's even colder than that? Dem niggas you running with don't give a fuck about you. See, right now, you need to look out for yourself. Right now you need to be worried about you and everybody that you love. Help us help you for them. Fuck it. I'll help y'all 'cause y'all gonna help me. As I told y'all, I didn't shoot nobody, I ain't kill nobody. You got the video. Shit got chaotic. I had to get the fuck out of there. But that work... that shit was Jerrell Jackson's work. You, uh... You do this a lot? Take girls out on yachts and treat them to fine dining? Yeah! All the time! No, I'm joking. Actually, a buddy of mine let's me use his boat whenever I'm in town. It's pretty soothing, though, right? It's all right. But, it ain't got nothing on this Italian restaurant Bistro Romano in Philly, baby. Okay, no argument from me. - Thank you. - Thank you. - You been to Philly? - No, never been. So, what brought you to LA? Well, partly for work. I own a construction company, and a buddy of mine from Orange County hired me to help him out with this housing development. And the other part? I needed a change of scenery. To be honest with you, uh... I lost my wife about a year ago. Everywhere I went in D.C. reminded me of her. So, I had to leave the city. I'm sorry, I... I completely dampened the mood. No. No, it's okay, really. I lost somebody close to me recently, too. You mind if I ask who? My boyfriend. Sorry, my fiance. We had just got engaged when he passed. I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay. Did you have kids? No. You? No. I mean, we... We planned to have kids, but I had just started my company, and my wife decided she wanted to go back to school, so never quite got around to it. Mm-hmm. Life has a way of sometimes getting in the way of your intentions, huh? But... I like this. You know, actually, it's... kind of a relief. Think about it. We both know each other's circumstances and that takes away the pressure of us trying to force a relationship too soon. That part. What's up? How's Cali treatin' you? - Shit. Better than Philly. - I bet. You want me to scoop the young chick up? Nah, let somebody else do that. We don't want it to look like what it is. Just because we're under pressure don't mean we have to get sloppy. Otherwise, we have a whole new set of problems on our hand when we get to the other side. So, check this out. Look. I gotta take care of this shit on this end, you hold it down in Philly. I'll be out-of-pocket for a minute, but, you know what to do. All right, I got you. All right. What's that about? You like it? I do. Me, too. What do you have planned tomorrow? Nothing in particular. Why? What's up? I was thinking that maybe I could return the favor. I was thinking that maybe I'd really like that. So, I know we ain't been out-out in a while, and my man is having a party tonight. I think we should slide through. Is there gonna be any food there? 'Cause every time we go to one of your homie's house, all they ever have is Henny and Coke. Yes. There's gonna be a DJ, food. It's gonna be, like, four stars or something. Okay, but, don't have me out there hungry. I told you, I think it's actually catered, to be straight. You think they'll have popcorn shrimp? Look, tonight, I'mma text you when I'm on my way, all right? Ooh, popcorn shrimp is so good! All right, and bring me some Twizzlers, too, when you leave, okay? Yeah. Yeah. I got you. For real. I'mma see you tonight. For sure. See? I told you we straight. That bitch would do anything for a free meal. It's all set. It's crackin' off tonight. And I'm gonna take care of Alia and Bria. She gonna bark like a dog by the time I get done with her. What's up? What's up? Nothing, I'm just checking on you. What you doing? I'm chilling. What's going on? Not too much. I mean, you just standing there, - You ain't gonna let me in? - It ain't even like that. I just wasn't expecting you. Okay. So, is you gonna let me in? What you been up to? Hey, it's your boy, London on Da Track. We got London on Da track! Why are you calling me when my tennis match is on? You know I love Venus, Serena, and Coco! Good serve! I need you to come get me. Why, what's going on? I'm at this party with Dalvin, right? And ever since I got here, he's been acting real strange. Strange, how? First of all, they ain't even got no food. Just some dry ass chicken. Bria? One minute he's acting all nice, right? And trying to get me to do drugs. And when I say no, he got all hostile. He put his hands on you? No. I didn't let him get a chance. He started tripping. I'm upstairs in the storage room. I locked myself in here. Text me the address. I'mma be on my way. Okay. Come in! It's open! Hello? Hi, sorry. I'm still getting dressed, but I'll be down in, like, five minutes. If you want, you can make yourself a drink at the bar in the living room. Well, would you like one as well? Well, I can't have you drink by yourself now, can I? You're right. Hi. Hi. You look amazing. Thank you. You look very handsome. Thank you. Red roses. I believe you said that they were your favorite. You're so sweet. Thank you. You're very welcome. To new beginnings. New beginnings. Oh, hold on one second. Let me just grab my phone, if you don't mind. - Of course. - I'll be right back. Open this door! Quit playing with me, Bria! So, what you been doing today? Nothing much. Had a few clients earlier and that's it. You got anyone here with you? Nah, it's just me. You cooking anything? No, but I got something to drink. You thirsty? What you doing? You think I wasn't gonna find out? Find out what? You knew who it is this whole time, and you didn't say nothing. I don't know what you're talking about. Could've saved yourself. Now you gotta check. So, what? You gonna kill me, huh? You couldn't kill this pussy, so you gonna kill me? All right, go ahead, kill me. - Couldn't kill this pussy? - Kill me. Kill me. Couldn't kill this pussy? You wanna get fucked one last time? Yeah. Hi, Mark. What can I do for you? I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I would hate myself if something happened to you because of this psycho. Psycho? What are you talking about? Some guy, he ran up on me and beat me because I was seeing you. What? I'm still laid up in bed with three broken ribs. And my face? My face is shit. Why would somebody do that? He's obsessed with you, I don't... Uh, okay, so... What did the guy look like? He was a Black guy. Brown skin, six-foot, 6'1", maybe. He had a beard. He's one of those tough guys, but not the loud ones, the quiet scary kind. Okay, um, did you get his name? No, but he had an East Coast vibe to him. Okay, Mark. Look, I have to go. Text me your address, and I'll come by your house. Okay. We got London on Da Track. Philly, what the fuck is up right now? Oh, shit. Hey, baby, you trying to dance? You know Dalvin? Yeah, I know Dalvin. Where he at? He upstairs with his girlfriend right now. But, you still trying to dance, mama? Oh, baby. What's wrong? I know this is really bad timing, and I'm really sorry, but I have an emergency and I have to go right now. - I'll go with you. - No, I have to go by myself. But, lunch, tomorrow, on me? Please? I'm so sorry. Yeah, no, you don't have to apologize. I understand. Things happen. Thank you. It's just really unfortunate that our night had to end so abruptly. I know. I'm really sorry. It's all good. At least let me see that dress one more time before I leave. I mean, that's the least you can do, right? Okay. You think I'm fucking stupid? What's going on in there? Oh, just trying to get my bitch up out of there. Maybe you can help out. Bria in there? Yeah. Wait. How'd you know her name? That's how. Bria! It's Shoog! You okay? You good? - Yeah. - Let's go. Okay. Hey! Wake your ass up. Niggas always sleepin'. Hey! Get your ass up! Get your ass up! Hey! Your little buddy, Mark, just had to come ruin everything, didn't he? Guess I gotta finish him off later. - You hit me? - Mm-hmm. - Why? - Caught your ass good, huh? Look, Gena. You've got Quadir's money. As far as I'm concerned, that's my money. And I need that. And I need to know who the fuck hit my truck with your cousin Bria? Bria? How you know Bria? What are you talking about? Hey, we can play this game all day. I ain't got nothing but time. Matter of fact, I've got 20 more ways that I can punch you in your face, all for real. Or one of two things can happen. Either one, I can leave this house a little bit richer, or two... your whole family can die. Fuck you! Let me go! Let me go! You fucking bitch! I don't want to kill you, but I will! I'll fucking kill you. You fucking bitch! You better hope I die. Bitch, I'm gonna fucking kill you! And this shit ain't even have to be all about the money! But fuck it. It is what it is. Where you think you going, bitch? Yeah. Like I said. Like I said, fuck you, bitch! Yo, bro, it's a fucking party! Get the fuck out my face! Fuck him up! Oh shit, get him, get him! Bitch ass! Chopped me in my motherfucking throat? Who the fuck does that shit, huh? Where the fuck is the money? Gena! Gena! Gena, wake up. Wake up! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who did this to you? Where the fuck is my money, Gena? I'll be right back, I promise. Don't you think that's a little bit too easy? Why don't you get your hands dirty? Isn't this... poetic? Come on! Come on! And now, I gotta kill you again. Ow. Look who's famous now. Titus. I appreciate you helping us solve these murders. Now, I just need you to match the faces with the names you gave us. Jerrell. Bria. Shoog. Shoog? Look, Titus. I need a statement today confirming all the information that you gave us on these suspects is the truth. Just be truthful. All right? We will call you. All right? Nice suit, by the way. You did pretty good, Titus. Thank you. I don't mind. We partners, now, right? Subtitles by explosiveskull
