[ALARM BEEPS] WORKOUT BOARD MEETING SEE MADRID SITE BLUEPRINT APPROVAL INVESTOR MEETING PARTNERS DINNER [WOMAN] Hello, and welcome to this week's episode of our show. It is a great privilege to welcome today's guest, our most recent cover story, and the architectural world's biggest star, Salvador Campodónico. - A pleasure to have you here. - Thanks for inviting me. Most of us have watched your meteoric rise establishing you as one of Spain's premier architects. Twenty-four hotels entirely remodeled in only six months. How did you manage such a feat? A lot of organization and very little sleep. Can you tell us a bit about your day-to-day routine? [SALVADOR] I wake up every day at 5:00 a.m. and work out. Then at 6:00, I head into the office. I love following a schedule. You could say I'm a bit obsessive. Tomorrow, I'll need to leave at 5:55 instead of at 6:00. [WOMAN] So is that one of the reasons you're still single? Yeah, you've got my number. I've yet to find a woman who's willing to put up with my work schedule. [WOMAN] You've won countless prizes for your gorgeous remodeling, and you're also the heir to a multimillion-dollar corporation in the throes of a full-expansion. And we've now heard a rumor that you're heading up the construction of a new Campodónico luxury hotel, the first of its kind to be built outside of Spain, boasting an unprecedented seven-stars. Is there any truth to this rumor? [SALVADOR] I would love to lead such a project, but the decision isn't up to me. What I can say is that if I'm chosen for the project, it'll be right up there with the Seven Wonders. Are you ready to conquer the world? The sky is the limit. Let's give him a round of applause. [APPLAUDING] CAMPODÓNICO HOTELS Dad, thank you for trusting me with this. That trust comes with a price tag. Don't let me down, son. [CONTINUES APPLAUDING] YOU'RE FLYING SOON EVERYTHING'S READY FOR YOUR TRIP CHECK YOUR ITINERARY NETFLIX PRESENTS [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] CUZCO, PERU 3339 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL "The keys are at the bottom of the staircase." [KEYS JINGLE] [DOOR THUDS, LOCK JINGLES] Hi, Dad. Look, this is the exact spot from the referral documents. Of course, once you and the team get here, it'll be much easier to discuss. But I think this is the ideal spot for us to build our wonder. Over there you have the Plaza de Armas de Cuzco. And this here, will be the entire site of the hotel. I really hope you like it. [SIGHS] [WHISTLING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] - [SONG ENDS] - [APPLAUDING] [SALVADOR] Thank you, everyone, for coming. I'm quite sure that as of today, there'll be a before and after in all our lives. And, above all, for Cuzco's tourism. I wish us all success. [ALL TOGETHER] Salud!

Hey! Hey! [CHEERING] Are you my Tinder date? - Come again? - Are you my Tinder date. Oh no, I don't use Tinder. I just came down here to... - Ah. - Do you know the blonde who was singing? [WOMAN] Of course, as though she were my own daughter. [ALL TOGETHER] Hey! Hey! Hey! Ooh! [GRUNTING] Here. What's this for? The legend says that when the woman is into the man, she lets the "cucurucho" burn. - The coo? - The coocoo. The little paper. Come on, light it! Hmm. Hang on. Mm. This is better. Uh-huh. But you'd better be very careful because that's my niece, matador. - Okay? - Uh-huh. Well, go on. -Thank you -Uh-huh. Yes, yes. Go on. Move a little. Shake those hips, honey. [BOTH GASP] [CHUCKLES] Oh, yeah? - [SALVADOR] I don't wanna burn you. - [CHUCKLES] I can't get burned if you can't light it. Yes, yes, yes! [SCREAMS] [WOMAN] Bravo! Aw, my lovelies! No, don't leave! I'll miss you. You just got here. If you ever want to spend some time on the beach, you know where to find me. Hey, careful what you ask for, sis, - or I might even come with you. - [CHUCKLES] All right, friends! I hope that tonight you are as generous as you are liberal with your applause. Because music will fill our souls, but it won't fill our bellies. So I'm asking you to please fill up my hat. Did you hear that? - Money, one dollar. My friend, one dollar. - [CHUCKLES] Ah. Ariana, come get the paints, 'cause tonight we're gonna be painting beneath the moonlight. - [ARIANA] I love you. - [WOMAN] Come on! Show me your money! Show, show, show me your money, gringo! - [CHUCKLES] - Come on! Don't pretend you don't understand me. Fill up my hat with your cold, hard cash! [CHUCKLES] [GASPS] - [SCOFFS] - I'm so sorry. Sorry about that. [GASPS, CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] I don't know what happened. I didn't see you. - I'm sorry! - Uh, right. Guess you don't know what a coat like this is worth. For real? Probably more than it should. Not really. It brings me good luck. So, it's kinda priceless. Well, it doesn't seem very lucky to me. I'm sorry. I really didn't see you. What do you need? Can I get you something? No. Well, yes. I wanted to congratulate you on your singing and dancing back there. - I loved the cajón flamenco. - Yeah, the cajón flamenco. The cajón is an instrument from Peru. But when your fellow countrymen arrived and decided to settle here, they saw it and claimed it as their own. Along with lots of other things. But no, it was born here. In Ica, actually. - Every day I learn something new. - Mm. So do you work here? For now, yeah. You're not staying here though, right? 'Cause I don't remember us having a presidential suite. - Mm. - Mm. No, I'm staying next door. - I don't know if you... - [WOMAN] Campodónico. You seemed familiar, but now I know why. You see, I thought you were my Tinder date, but no. - You're my Airbnb client. [CHUCKLES] - [SALVADOR] Oh you're the owner. Yes, I am Lichi Campos. I'm the administrator here and the local custodian of the sacred land upon which we're treading. How are you? Did you get what you need? Is everything good with the house and key? Yes, of course. I found the key, but unfortunately, it broke. I can go get it fixed tomorrow morning, but I'll need a bed for this evening. I would offer you mine, but my bed springs are a little bit worn out. So, uh, they wouldn't last. And so... You'll take care of him won't you? Yeah? Treat him like a perfect little prince who paid a lot of money up-front and in cash, won't you? A lot of money. [CHUCKLES] Very well. I'll leave you. My Tinder date is here. [CHUCKLES] - [SALVADOR] Lovely to meet you. - It was a delight to meet you. - Night, auntie. - [LICHI] Bye. Well, tomorrow I can bring this jacket over to the laundromat. We'll see if they can salvage it. Oh no, don't worry. I've got more jackets, or coats. But, uh, what I really do need is a bed. Would you like a single or shared room? Uh, I guess it depends on who's sharing it. ["FRANCISCA PIZARRO" BY RENATA FLORES PLAYING] - That... that's Quechua, right? - Mm-hmm. - [SALVADOR] You speak Quechua? - [ARIANA] I wish I were more fluent. - My friends are teaching me. - [SALVADOR] What've you learned? That in Quechua there isn't really a word for "goodbye," for example. Oh no. How do they say it then? Or do they even say it? They say, um, it's an expression. They say "Tupanachiskama." It means something along the lines of "until we meet again." Anyway, I'm just learning. Tupanachiskama. I love the way that sounds. Yeah. Yeah, so you... - [EXHALES] - ...you don't dance a lot, do you? Mm, sometimes. But you already made a fool of me, so I'm good for now. Isn't being a fool good? Huh? I'm always making a fool out of myself. And besides, you're looking too tense. I think you need to relax a little. - [SONG ENDS] - [APPLAUDS] Just so you know, there's always someone at the front desk starting at 6:00 in the morning. - Thank you. - Yeah. If you need anything. - Mm-hmm. - Well, I'll be there. Okay? Great. - Sleep well. - Uh, what time do you finish work? Uh, depends. I usually make my own hours. [CHUCKLES] Why? Uh, in case you wanna grab a drink. Handsome men don't do it for me. [CHUCKLES] They don't do it for me either. What a coincidence. [CHUCKLES] You sure? Not even a little? - Depends on how much I've had to drink. - [CHUCKLES] Wow, that just made things exciting. Do you like pisco? No. Well, I don't like to mix. I already had a beer earlier. What's happening? You sound like you're 80. And besides, you're in Cuzco now. You've gotta learn to relax. All right, then. You gotta be gentle with me. It's my first time. Really? I assumed you'd have more experience than that. - [CLEARS THROAT] - Well, anyway, this hostel has a little welcoming tradition, okay? It's the willkommen shot. - I see. - Yeah? - So it's three shots of pisco. - Great. - Are you ready? - Yes. [SCOFFS] - Salud. - Salud. [BOTH CLEAR THROAT] [CLEARS THROAT] - [IN ENGLISH] Soroche? - Soroche? No, no. I'm perfectly fine. I run three miles every single day. Oh, okay. [CLEARS THROAT] - So you good for round two? - For sure. Right. Of course, of course. This is for you. Don't underestimate the altitude now. - Mm-hmm. - You be careful. [SALVADOR CLEARS THROAT] [INHALES] [EXHALES] You traveling alone? It's just me, myself, and I. Mm. So dare I ask if you're single? Single with no commitments. - [GASPS] - You? Single, seeking no commitment. - Hmm. - And you? Either or. Hmm. [EXHALES] [CHUCKLES] - So tell me, backpacker. - Hmm? You got any hidden talents, other than singing, dancing, - playing the cajón. Peruvian cajón... - Hmm. ...and face painting? A few others. - We on three? - Mm-hmm. Yes. [GLASSES THUD] [SALVADOR EXHALES] Are you sure? You're in Cuzco, man. Do yourself a favor. Let go. Salud. - [GLASSES CLINK] - Salud. [EXHALES] [INHALES] [IN ENGLISH] No kissing on the first date. [SUCKS TEETH] [SALVADOR INHALES] Right, but this wasn't really a date.

The share price of Campodónico Corp. is still rising after the company announced it would build it's first seven-star hotel in Cuzco. There are high expectations for the powerful corporation's project, especially because the architect is... - Thank you, Lau. [CHUCKLES] - [LAU] Thank you. [LICHI] Good morning. - Mm! Good morning, good morning! - [CHUCKLES] - Good morning, good morning! - [CHUCKLES] Good morning! Morning. - Hi, good morning. - Good morning. [INHALES] I think it's been years since I slept so late. - Oh! - You're welcome. - [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] - [LICHI GASPS] So is there a local hardware store around here? Oh, did I loosen a few of your screws? - [LICHI] Mm! - One or two. All right. Now, now, a little control. Control yourselves, although, all of us, and I mean all of us, heard you two. - Yes, and we also heard you. - Oh yeah? - Yes, yes. - Oh! [CHUCKLES] A lady doesn't kiss and tell. Hmm? - No, she doesn't. - [GASPS] Please excuse me. - I hope a gentlemen has no memory. - [CHUCKLES] Whatever do you mean? What was your name again? And you? [CHUCKLES] Last call for laundry! I'm leaving now, never to return. - Hurry up! I'm going! - Hey! Here you go. - [ARIANA] Come on! Come on! - Merci beaucoup, Ari! - Muchas gracias! We'll pay you later. - Thanks, Ari! - [MAN] Can you iron that one well, please? - [MAN 2] Give me a discount! This-this is how you do laundry? [WOMAN] Thanks, honey. I owe you one. Here you go. - I'll get it. - Ha! The laundromat is next to the hardware store. Uh, well, can I come with you? Sure. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, how long you staying here for? Minimum one year, maximum two. Wow! Sabbatical? No, no, the opposite. I've come here to build a hotel. Wait. Here's the project. A marvel of architecture facing a wonder of the world. What do you think? Hmm. [SALVADOR SIGHS] And did you did this one too? Yes, but that was just a remodel in 2017, but the corporation didn't approve that one. Yeah, well, that makes sense. What do you mean? I... Well, I... [SIGHS] You're saying you wanna put a chunk of concrete and cement over here on this pretty beach? Do you know the Burj Al Arab in Dubai? I do. The hotel that was constructed on a huge, fake, man-made island. That's it. Don't you think what architecture can accomplish is amazing? Totally impressive. Just incredible. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Tell me something, do you wanna build an eyesore like that here in Cuzco? This is going to be unprecedented for tourists. There's only one seven-star hotel in the world. And only one Machu Picchu. Except you can't remodel that. You don't think we have enough hotels here in Cuzco? Sure I do, but none of them are like this one. [CHUCKLES] Ah, okay! [GASPS] Oh, so you're kind of a modern Francisco Pizarro, are you? You've come here to conquer us once again. Huh? No, uh... I'm sorry. Did I say something that made you feel bad? Did I say something that offended you? Because I thought we were in sync. No. I don't get offended until someone shows me their true colors. Just one more thing. Are you interested in this house and this property because you... because you want to build here? The land is ideal, and the views are some of the best in the city. The hostel isn't for sale. You're not even the owner. You said you're just passing through. The land belongs to my aunt, and I'm telling you that it's not for sale and it will never be for sale. Well... [INHALES] ...everything has it's price. No. You can't put a price tag on people. At least not the people that I know. [SIGHS] Oh, and last night was a one-time thing. It'll never happen again. So we're clear. Understood. [FOOTSTEPS LEAVING] [DOOR OPENS] - [SALVADOR INHALES, EXHALES] - [DOOR CLOSES] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] - Will that be cash or debit? - Thanks. - I'll use the QR code. - Oh, okay. [CHUCKLES] Oh! So give me all the gorgeous details from last night. - Ooh, oh, oh! - No. There's nothing to tell. Did you feel like Shakira and Piqué? No. It's not funny, Lichi. For real. Aw, honey, what's wrong? I saw you sneak out of there at 3:00 a.m., and since then, I've been waiting for the d... d... details. Come on, tell me, honey! Oh! [SIGHS] I slept with the enemy. Why? Was it really kinky? Auntie! I told you, I'm not in the mood! So? You think I'm squeamish or what? You can tell me anything. - What is it? Tell me! - [SIGHS] Oh, no. Don't tell me he said something disgusting because if he did, I'm gonna punch him. I can't believe I fell for his tricks like a loser. At least it's a breakthrough. Auntie, be serious! It's not funny anymore. That's it! Spill the beans! Explain to me how anyone whose got a brain could prefer a cement building over this house. This is our legacy. The adobe, the stonework, everything! Made by hand. I mean, we're in Cuzco. We're not in Dubai! Cuzco is the beating heart of traditions and mysticism. Our legacy lives in this place. Now we're supposed to put cement everywhere and install air condition so people can sleep? You lost me at "cement." I don't mind a good air conditioner. - But what are you really mad about, honey? - The colonizers! They're like bugs! It'll be an infestation soon! All due respect to insects, I know how important they are. But thatarrogant, self-absorbed, oafish... I mean, yeah, yeah, he's beautiful, but what is... It's... Anyway, if I'd known that he came just so that he could cover us in cement, do you think I... [SIGHS] I could've... Ugh! God! Maybe I should get his blueprints and shut him up... [BLENDER WHIRRING] Hey. Yeah? I'm telling you, he's trying to buy the hostel - and you don't seem to care. - Huh? I'm telling you... Don't you get how important this place is to me? And to our family's lineage? - Hey! - Ah! Ugh! [CHUCKLES] The guy really got to you, huh? [SIGHS] Oh! So sorry! I know you've been waiting for this juice, but it's ready now. One second. [CHUCKLES] Oh my goodness. Yes, that's exactly it. It'll be three or four million tourists every year. Yeah, I've worked it out. I'll send you the files with the spreadsheets, all right? Thanks. DAD PRIVATE NUMBER - [SIGHS] - [CELL PHONE RINGING] CUZCO SUPPLIER Yes? Yeah, Purgatorio 420. Uh-huh, I'm here. So, let's see. This area is where you did most of the renovations and improvements, and this whole area is still untouched. Mm-hmm. Yes. Aw, what have we here? The little prince couldn't handle his cold shower? Oh, come on! With that boiler we can all have hot water at the hostel. Hmm? Can I ask you about those blueprints? Sure, it's a free country. What are they for? - I'm sorry? - Those blueprints. What is that? Why you being so bitchy? Ah, this is what can happen when you fuck the Airbnb guests. I'm sorry I had to go there, but good sex has it's consequences. - What are they for? - What was that? The blueprints. Sal, honey, tell her. We'll, we're looking at the viability of the land for construction. [ARIANA SCOFFS] - You're going ahead with the sale? - If it were up to me, I'd give it away. - Oh, how generous of you. - [LICHI] Mm. That's very sweet! The two of you make a really cute couple. So cute. -Oh yeah? She thinks we're cute, -[CHUCKLES] - [ARIANA] Unbelievable. - Mm. [KISSES] [SALVADOR] What about this area that isn't in the blueprints? Who does that belong to? - [GRUNTS] - [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Read 'em and weep. - Oh! You decided to leave your room. - What? A person can't take a nap anymore? [LICHI] A nap? You've been holed up in your room since yesterday. - [ARIANA SIGHS] - Still in a bad mood? Oh. Uh, actually, in Spain the siesta is no longer popular. - Oh! - [ARIANA] Naps are very important. And you'd know that if you weren't a robot that only knows how to work, work, work. Is she always like this? - Sometimes she's worse. - Mm. [CHUCKLES] This kind of feels like I'm on vacation, a vacation with the best home office ever. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Poor little you. Poor little rich boy. I don't wanna be near you guys. I'm gonna eat alone in my room. Now then, where were we? I should just put these down. You didn't play this. You switched 'em. You're cheating. - Come on. - How could I cheat you? - Lichi, I saw you. - I didn't. Check them. I'll close my eyes. - Well then, let me check. - No, no, no! - You play cachito better? - Don't think so. - Cachito, you've played it. - You'll take advantage. How could you not know cachito? What do you do in Spain? [MAN] Look. I found something. [MAN 2] What? Clean it off. - Let's show it to the boss. - [MAN 1] Got it. [GENTLE GUITAR STRUMMING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [MAN 1] Sorry to bother you. We found this. - Thank you. - You're welcome. [SCOFFS] [GENTLE GUITAR CONTINUES] [KNOCKING ON WALL] The guys found this. I think it's yours. [SIGHS] I had forgotten about all this. I figured it was something you might want to see. [SIGHS] Um... Thanks for the excavation of my memories. Close the door on your way out, please. [FOOTSTEPS LEAVING] [DOOR HINGE CREAKS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFLES] [INHALES SHARPLY] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [CLEARS THROAT] [WHISPERS] Give me a break! Can you explain to me why you're the last thing I see before I go to bed and the first thing I see when I wake up? 'Cause your dreams are finally a reality? You mean my nightmares. I went to the front desk, but no one was there. Customer service will start at 6:00 in the morning, sir. Well, it's 6:13. Would you like me to get you a watch? I'd like a little information about the tours. Those tours are not for you. - Oh no? - No. Why aren't they for me? They're for people who can handle cold showers and roughing it. Ah, is that a requirement? Bathing while on the tour? I was thinking of Machu Picchu. That's a must-see, right? Yeah. Of course, you'll need your selfie for Instagram. Exactly. How about the Salcantay tour? Salcantay is a tour that takes five days. An alternative to the Inca Trail. Much too demanding for you. One of my favorites. And who's the guide? Take a guess. Well then, count me in. Do we sign up over here? - Can I help you with that? - No. Yes, no, not that. - This, here. This as well. - This? But what should I do with it? - Put it there. Over there. Taking that. - Where? - This one too? - Why do you have this? Well, it's... And this is what? Oh, this is very important. My beard trimmer. - Oh, that's a no. Okay. Ready? Let's go. - No, I'll get it. - Hi there! - [SALVADOR SIGHS] Right. Yanil León and Fernando Espósito? Nandito. Please just call me "Nandito." - I don't relate to "Fernando." - Wasn't your group supposed to be six? Yes. Except, what happened was that none of us will be able to make it. We're not feeling too well. Yesterday, I saw the most ugly penis I've seen in my whole life. Okay. I get it, but you can't just pull out and cancel at the last minute. Yes, but let me tell you something. What happened is that... [INHALES] What happened was... See, what happened was... The thing... - I wanna say... - [SIGHS] For example, yesterday... [VOMITING] [SIGHS] [VOMITING] [YANIL BREATHES HEAVILY] - Something didn't sit well in our bellies. - [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] Thanks for helping me. The next tour is in a month. The minimum quota is five people. To cover the expenses. But I already set the days aside. I canceled meetings with my father, the company... Life isn't always about getting what you want. Is that so? I can pay for everyone else. For all six people? Seven, with me. Yeah. - Right. Of course, daddy pays... [SCOFFS] - Is "Daddy pays" my new nickname? It's super cute the way you sugarcoat things. It's like saying a mini favor. It's like the favor is sliced in two making it seem like less of a favor, you know? Oh goodness. I thought the puke would be a sure way to get rid of you. No, I'm not that fickle. I saw that beard trimmer. You're super fickle. [CHUCKLES] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SALVADOR] Seven soles? Look, I could use this to draw the hotel I'm gonna build on your land. [CHUCKLES] [WOMAN] This one takes away negative energy. Uh, give me three of that. In fact, I'll take a whole truck full. - Yeah. - Sure. To get that negative energy out you might have to do it again. You can't do it too many times. Bad vibes here. - All right, turn around. - Now from behind. Turn around. [INDISTINCT YELLING] That! That! That one over there. What is it called? [ARIANA] Thank you! Can I? It's very helpful for people with diabetes. Uh, hey, since we're gonna be together for the next five days, - can I ask you something? - Does that question count? [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] Why does it bother you so much that I'm building a hotel? Look! This city thrives off tourism. It's a good thing for... No, no, no! This city doesn't thrive off of tourism. It thrives because of it's culture and sacred traditions. And tourism is just a consequence. You live in a hostel. Don't you think that's a bit contradictory? I'm pretty sure I have every right in the world to put up a fight against the rich son of papa, who wants to demolish my family's house just to cover it all up with cement. I don't think it's that hard to understand why I dislike you so much. [CHUCKLES] Your aunt lives in the hostel, in her ex husband's house. She's happy at the hostel. Besides, she'll be getting so much money. Okay. Hang on. So you want me to say I'm grateful to you? Do you want me to thank you because in two years there's going to be a huge building to wake up to? Instead of beautiful views of the mountains? What does it matter? You don't even live there. It's unethical. And besides, did you even ask the people if they want a seven-star hotel here? Who in this city, wants a seven-star hotel here? Explain it to me! I can explain it, okay? But just because we have different ideas or different opinions doesn't mean you can speak to me that way. [SCOFFS] Okay. I guess I'll have to keep working on my emotional maturity then. [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Listen. How about this, why don't we agree to disagree on things right now, and try to have a good time anyway? I mean, look at where we are right now. At the foot of this magnificent church, We could take this opportunity to repent and make a purpose of amendment. Hmm? I don't believe in religions. All right. Uh, then what do you believe in, Ms. Backpacker? My mom had faith in the Virgin. And you? I just pray to my mom. - [CHUCKLES] - Here's our Uber. - Uberto! - [SUCKS TEETH] - [UBERTO] Ariana! - How you doing? - [UBERTO] Arianacha! - Get over here. - My beautiful friend, how are you? - I've missed you! - Everything's good. Uh-huh. - You good? - Salvador Campodónico. How are you? - Pleasure. - Where we going today? - Directly up to Salcantay. - Into the wild mountains? - You know it! - This city boy's gonna have trouble! - Nothing I don't deserve. - You carrying any coca leaves? - Yes. Yeah, you know you have to ask permission from the Apu. - Don't worry, I will. - So, we're not gonna be walking from here? Of course we'll walk, but we need to get to a higher point. You really have no idea where you're going, do you? Well, it's really strange, but I guess I'm starting to trust you, Arianacha. - Watch yourself. - [CHUCKLES] - [SALVADOR] How old is this car exactly? - [UBERTO] I've had this baby since 1979. [SALVADOR] '79? You sure it's gonna get us there? [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [ARIANA] See? Over there. [ARIANA SCOFFS] [ARIANA CHUCKLES] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [ARIANA] Yeah. [ARIANA SIGHS] [ARIANA SIGHS] - What? - No, uh... [CHUCKLES] May I ask why you have the word "enema" tattooed on your neck? It's a bit odd. It doesn't say, "Enema," it says "Elena." - Ah! - [CHUCKLES] I met an artist in Colombia, and she would only tattoo you if your story made her cry. And so, I told her mine, and... I wanted to get my grandmother's name because she was the first person to encourage me to study art, because she said it was the only thing that machines could never replace. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So the machine thing, that's what you told her so she'd cry? No. [CHUCKLES] No, that wasn't the story. You gonna tell me what it was? No, I won't tell you the story. I'm not in the mood to be comforted. [SALVADOR SIGHS] - [ARIANA CHUCKLES] - Al right. Would you mind taking a photo of me? [CHUCKLES] - It's super easy. - [SCOFFS] - [SIGHS] - Put it in landscape, please. Yeah. Open your arms up again. - Like this? - Uh-huh. I'm taking in good energy. - That's not... Super explorer! - I'm like an explorer. Check it out! Yeah, like this. - [SCOFFS] - [ROCK SPLASHES] Oh! This photo's gonna get you so many likes on Instagram. Oh! Hang on! check it out! Take one like this, where I look like I'm thinking, you know? - Yeah. - I'm staring at this thinking of everything. How we're all connected. [ARIANA CHUCKLES] [SALVADOR] Huh? [CHUCKLES] [ARIANA CONTINUES CHUCKLING] Looks good, right? - Want me to take one of you? An enema? - Oh wow! What? [CHUCKLES] [ARIANA] Ooh! Ah! Not afraid of getting burned? No. I love fire. It's my favorite element, even though I'm a Libra. What difference does that make? Because Libra is an air sign. Which means, I should be more airy, more like the wind than fire. Wind and fire is a dangerous combination. You better believe it. [EXHALES] [EXHALES] [ARIANA SIGHS] [SALVADOR SIGHS] What kind of star rating would you give this hotel? [SALVADOR EXHALES] I don't think I've ever heard this much silence. - [EXHALES] - Silence is beautiful. [SALVADOR] Are we almost there? [ARIANA] Ah! Stop asking questions like the donkey in Shrek. You've asked me the same question ten times, you know? You're absolutely sure we're not lost, right? Because my watch is saying we've already walked 32 kilometers. Yesterday, you said we'd walk 16 kilometers today. Sixteen from yesterday is 32. What's up? I'm not really into mathematics. That's weird, since you're so good at music. What's that got to do with it? Mathematics is the system that allows music to last longer than an instant. It is to music what a pulsar is to the life in the stars. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Is that so? My brain is never not thinking about numbers. From a young age, I was obsessed with music, and then it was mathematics. Then in university, I loved architecture, which led to investments, banks, bonds, interest... [CHUCKLES] You were on the right path, then you took a wrong turn. I was on the right path. - But are we on the right path now? - Come on! Ariana! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [SALVADOR SIGHS] [ARIANA INHALES] [ARIANA EXHALES] Try to empty out your mind and just concentrate on your breathing. [ARIANA INHALES] - Uh... - [ARIANA EXHALES] No, no. I don't really know how to empty out my mind. I've never meditated. No, uh, it's impossible for me to clear my mind. I don't wanna bug you. We should keep going. Start up again, because this is telling me it's gonna start raining here soon. Please try it out. Please? - All right. - Come on, come on. - Sit like this. - [SALVADOR SIGHS] [ARIANA INHALES] Better to sit up straight. Okay, concentrate on your breathing now. Inhale. [INHALES] - Exhale. - [EXHALES] [INHALES] [EXHALES] Okay. Keep going. Inhale. [SALVADOR INHALES] - Exhale. - [SALVADOR EXHALES] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [ARIANA] Clear your mind. Feel the sound of the water. Feel the wind on your face. [CHUCKLES] - I fell asleep! - Yeah. I know. [CHUCKLES] [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] I never sleep during the day. You see? It's very important to try new things. I'm so used to thinking about something all the time, you know? I never thought I was capable of clearing my mind. Yet at the same time, your consciousness is open. - [CHUCKLES] - But now we better go. It'll be dark soon. And I know that you, sir, do not like to be late. It's time to go for more. [SIGHS] "It's time to go for more." [SALVADOR CHUCKLES, GRUNTS] - Thanks. - Sure. [SALVADOR] In my day-to-day life, I don't have time to think about nothing. [ARIANA] You live to put money in the bank. I live to be able to have time for myself. That's my luxury. [ARIANA SNIFFLES] [GENTLE MUSIC CONTINUES] ABRA SALKANTAY ALT. 4600 METERS [BREATHING HEAVILY] - Four-thousand, six-hundred meters. - [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] - We made it, man! - [BOTH CHUCKLE] - [SALVADOR SNIFFLES] - Do you want me to take it? - No, I want you to be in it! - Yeah? Yeah, yeah, of course. Together, so we can capture this moment. - Whoo-hoo! - [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] [IN KOREAN] Want me to take one? Sure! Can you please take one? [MAN] Of course. - Ready, on three. - [ARIANA CHUCKLES] One, two, three. - One more. One, two, three. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] One, two, three. - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - [BOTH CHUCKLE] Are you two a couple? Yeah, we're on our honeymoon. Handsome couple. Thank you. So are you. Thanks. See you later! Have a great trip! Thanks! [ARIANA IN ENGLISH] Thank you! Thank you! Well, you're really turning out to be full of surprises. Yeah, well, you're not the only one shrouded in mystery, little miss prejudice. Ha! The altitude makes you think you're funny, huh? [CHUCKLES] What? What did they say? They congratulated us on our marriage. They said we make a beautiful couple. - [CHUCKLES] - No way. You're making that up. No, I'm serious. I told them we were on our honeymoon. [CHUCKLES] - Honeymoon? - [BOTH CHUCKLE] More like, ice-moon. I do not understand why people congratulate you when they find out you got married. See, I don't even understand why we still do it. - Because it's romantic? - [ARIANA SCOFFS] Love and romance are overrated. It's like being imprisoned. It's too possessive. It's like being chained to a bridge or something. I know it's a terrible metaphor for love, but I can't stop picturing rusty locks just hanging on to an old bridge. Right? What in the world's made you so tough, I wonder. I'm not tough. No. I just don't believe in romantic love. Same goes for marriage. - [ARIANA SIGHS] - [SALVADOR CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I prefer tattooing myself. Doesn't hurt as much, and lasts forever. [ARIANA SIGHS] [SALVADOR SIGHS] [SIGHS, CHUCKLES] [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] - No, seriously? All right, another. - Another. Uh, cumbia or reggae? Uh... Pfft, cumbia? Very nice! - Cumbia. - [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] - Have you even heard cumbia? - [CELL PHONE DINGS] [BOTH SIGH] Ugh, I don't believe this. [CHUCKLES] No, I'm the one that doesn't believe it. There's reception here! BOARD OF DIRECTORS DAD PRIVATE NUMBER What are you doing? ASSISTANT - Come on, turn that thing off. - Just hang on a minute. Hang on. MANAGEMENT TEAM Give it to me. - No, no. Just wait. - Give it! - Wait! Hang on! - No! You don't have to answer that. [ARIANA GASPS] [SALVADOR GROANS] - [SALVADOR SIGHS] - Forgive me. I really didn't mean to do that. [ARIANA SIGHS] It was an accident. I'm sorry. [ARIANA SIGHS] Maybe you could look at it as an opportunity to finally get rid of your addiction. My... my addiction? Ariana, I've gone five days without coverage. [SCOFFS] It's my work phone. Yes, but you don't have to be working right now. It's an opportunity to take time for yourself. I am always working. And my father wants me to stay connected, and stay on top of the emails coming in, all the calls from the company and the board. But you don't have to stay connected all the time. Connect more with yourself. That's what you really need. [SCOFFS] Who are you connected to other than yourself right now? Huh? Tell me. It's really easy to say that, isn't it? You run around the world without plans, without ties, or bags. Nothing affects you. Tell me, who are you connected to? Is it that hard for you not to have a phone? No, it's not the phone. It's that you don't understand! You criticize and criticize, but what are you bringing to it? Huh? But what does that accomplish? Criticizing my wanting to leave a legacy. You decide you're bored, you pack a bag, and you leave. That's a convenient way to live. [SCOFFS] You wouldn't even last a week. [SALVADOR SIGHS] [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Salva. [SCOFFS] Oh Jesus. You just can not keep your mouth shut. No, you just had to open up your goddamn mouth. [SIGHS] Salva. So you still mad? At least now you know that we're not that different. [ARIANA SUCKS TEETH] I thought that maybe we could take a detour. To see if it could possibly put you in a better mood. Wanna see it? [ARIANA] So are you feeling better? Do you like the surprise? [SALVADOR] I can't believe that there are hot springs up here. I hadn't noticed the scar under your tattoo. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYS] I like what scars represent. They hurt and then they heal over. How did that happen? An accident. [SQUEALS] [SIGHS] So you know where you're going after Cuzco? No. - No? - No. How can you live without knowing where you're gonna go next? That's what I like most about traveling. Being totally free. Oh, aren't you afraid of doing it alone? Ha. [SCOFFS] - Would you ask a man the same question? - Sure. I'd ask a man. I mean, I'm not afraid, but... I'm not sure I could handle not knowing where I'm gonna be all the time. That's the beauty of it. When there's no destination, you're never late. And you're never lost. You're always exactly where you need to be. You prioritize the journey. Like right now, for example. Of course, we could've gone to Machu Picchu on the train with heating, drinking nice tea. But we would've completely missed out on this experience. I wouldn't trade this trip for anything. Mm. We said that we wouldn't. We can't. What if we're exactly where we're supposed to be right now? But you know I'm still leaving. And I don't want to complicate anything. I don't see any red thread around us. Do you? Ugh! Told you I don't want to be in a relationship or in anything that even looks like one. We have a good time together. We like each other. - Mm. - Let's enjoy it. Just for now. You really love to play around with fire, don't you? Promise I won't burn myself. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] No, I don't mean your final destination like in many years from now, but... where are you itching to go? Your next destination. What's on your bucket list? [ARIANA CHUCKLES] That would have to be Puno. I don't know Puno, but I would love to go there. I'd also really like to spend some time on a beach. And you know, we have some unbelievable beaches in the north. - The sea would be great right now, huh? - Oh yes. The sea heals everything. Well. Here we are. Are you ready to meet the Peruvian wonder? I thought I had already met her. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] [SALVADOR SIGHS] It's official. I've been conquered by Peru. [ARIANA] We call that poetic justice. Or karma, if you look at life in a negative way. What? - That was an affectionate gesture. - Oh, give me a break. You're starting to worry me, Ariana María. Now I wouldn't want you to make things complicated. You are so stupid. I would never be with someone like you. Hey, we agreed you wouldn't fall in love with me. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I know it's complicated, but you did promise. [CHUCKLES] Yes! [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Back to reality. [WOMAN] Hey, what's happening? [MAN] Hey driver, watch the road! You okay? Yes. Yes. Sir? Sir, could you drive a little more slowly please? [GEARS THUD] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [TIRES SCREECH] - [ALL GASP] - [WOMAN] Hey! Oh! [HORN HONKS] Madam, please sit down! And put on your seat belt. What seat belt? There isn't one. [WHIMPERS] [WOMAN] No, young man. Thank you. [MAN] I know. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Are you sure you're all right? I just feel a little nervous on the highway. That's all. - [HORN HONKS] - [MAN] Watch where you're going! [MAN 2] What do you think you're doing? You trying to kill us? You call that driving? [THUNDER RUMBLING] [RAIN INTENSIFYING] - [ALL SCREAM] - [TIRES SCREECH] - [GRUNTS] - [BRAKES HISS] [DRIVER ECHOES] Everyone okay? Huh? [EXHALES] [INHALES] [EXHALES] [INHALES] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [SNIFFLES] [GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Well, hello, hello! What happened? Did you have another fight? Oh my goodness. I'll tell you, I love my niece, but she gets crazier every day. Can't believe she's in a bad mood again. Ugh! [SALVADOR SIGHS] It's not that, Lichi. She's just not... not feeling very well. [CHUCKLES] Something happen to Ari? No, no. Well... [EXHALES] I'm not sure. We were on a bus coming back here, and it started to rain. And the bus driver kind of lost control. At one point, it seemed like we were going to go off the road. [INHALES] Then we all got out, and... and then she didn't want to get back on again. Hmm. [SALVADOR SIGHS] Does it maybe have something to do with Elena's accident? My mother didn't die in an accident. My mother died of old age. In her sleep. Well, she talked a bit about an accident. [INHALES] Yes, my... my sister died that way. Her mother. And Ari's father too. She was the only one who made it. She was 13. [SALVADOR SIGHS] I'm grateful you were with her. - Truly. - No. Don't mention it, Lichi. [LICHI SIGHS] Thanks. Thank you. Hmm. [SIGHS] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [ELECTRONIC WHIRRING] CAMPODÓNICO BOARD DAD PRIVATE NUMBER MANAGEMENT TEAM EGOCENTRIC HOTEL CHAIN... [ELECTRONIC WHIRRING] [EXHALES] [SCOFFS] Why did you list only 200 rooms, when we projected 300? I had to remove three floors because we won't be able to build as projected. Well, make it happen. Buy more land or build sideways for all I care. The neighbors don't want to sell, okay? It's only 100 rooms less, Dad. One hundred rooms at 400 euros a night is €1,200,000 a month. Is the altitude affecting your math, or should I just take it out of your inheritance, huh? As soon as you have the meeting with the official from the town hall that I set up for you, make damn sure that you call me. You have to prove to me you're capable of playing in the big leagues. Which you insisted on, by the way. And don't you dare turn off your cellphone for that long again. I need you to stay... [CALL ENDS] [SIGHS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] - Salvador Campodónico? - Yes. - And you must be the city counselor. Mr... - Toño. - "Toño" to my friends. [CHUCKLES] - Nice to meet you. Well now, let's be clear, I'm not here in an official capacity today. - Oh no? - No. [TOÑO CLICKS TONGUE] Your father contacted me and told me you're trying to build a hotel that's over four stories high. Which requires a special permit. - [SALVADOR] Yes, exactly. - Hmm. Here is the project. Our request has already been denied twice. Is there anything we can do about this? Well, luckily for you and your father, I'm in a position of power where whatever I say goes. [CHUCKLES] And I'm a really big fan of the Spanish football team. - Oh wonderful. That's good to know. - [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Well, I'm all ears. What can be done? Well, Salvador. Let me ask you this. How much is it worth to you? Huh? You know what I mean? I see. I get it. Hey, sweetheart, would you bring me an Americano? Thanks. Now then, shall we get down to business? [CAR HORNS HONK] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] - [LICHI] There you are. - [ARIANA INHALES] - Hey. - [CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES] How are you? You haven't come out all day. No, I wanted to stay up here and rest. [INHALES] - [EXHALES] - Okay. Some scars just don't go away with time. You can try to hide them, but they're always there. [LICHI] Hmm. [LICHI SIGHS] You want a little muña tea? - Yes. - Yeah? Perfect. Do you want it now or would you prefer to have it later? Maybe later. [CHUCKLES] All right, then I'll stay. [BOTH SIGH] I'm here. You're okay. Mm. [SIGHS] Do you understand me or not? Do you? I feel like you and I need to have better communication, huh? Are you even listening to me? What? Do you have a name? - Margaret, Mary, what? - Oh. Look. She... she snuck into my board meeting. Oh yeah? And since when do you have a board? - [SALVADOR SIGHS] - Since we got that boiler. - Ah. - Ah. So do they have names? Yes. This is Porko, and this is Rosita. They're dating. They're a thing. So they like to keep it in the family? - Well, we might still eat them. - No! - That's not how you treat family, Lichi. - Oh, okay. How are you? - [SALVADOR SIGHS] Mm. - Are you okay? Working remotely is hard on your muscles. Mock me all you like, but there's always some difficult decision to be made. Mm. Must be difficult picking out bidets. Mm. [CHUCKLES] Ah, come on. You've got to get used to my sense of humor. Is that your sense of humor, or your way of not letting anyone past your emotional limits? No, uh... [GASPS] Okay, okay, fine. Sense of humor. I'll accept this euphemism. Oh! Oh! [CHUCKLES] He's got your number. He's got your number, honey. [CHUCKLES] Uh-oh, the point goes to Spain. - Goal. Goal! Ah! - [CHUCKLES] Thanks a lot, Lichi. [LICHI CHUCKLES] Well, maybe in the morning I'll give you physiotherapy. [SCOFFS] Why not today? Oh, today there's a party for Uberto. Ah, yes, he invited me too. - No, he didn't. - No. He didn't. But, if you want me to come with you, I would be happy to. [INHALES] - Pick me up around 4:00? - Is this a date? [ARIANA INHALES] You're gonna be on time, right? - I am. - All right. [INHALES] [EXHALES] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] Everything you see we planted with Uberto when he was about 15 years old. This is incredible. You know so many magical places, huh? Hmm? You haven't seen anything yet Just wait. Arianacha! Oh Hey! - Uberto! - Arianacha! How are you, beautiful? Hello. My love! - How are you? Salvador? - Yes. How are you? You remember each other? - Mm, yes. - Uberto, Salvador. This is Urpi, she's like my little sister. Great to meet you, Urpi. - I have muña for the huatia. - Thank you, my sweet. Thank you. Welcome! Let's go! Let's get ready for the huatia. - What's a huatia? - A meal we make in an underground oven. Everything goes into the oven. - [SALVADOR] Everything goes in at once? - Yes, everything goes in at the same time. And you'll get to try some of the 3,000 varieties of potatoes we got. - Three thousand kinds of potatoes? - Yeah. - Do you call them "potatoes" in Spain? - Oh, sure. Yeah. You should see them. [UBERTO] Here. Put them here. Just like this on the side. - [ARIANA] Hi, how are you? - [SALVADOR] More wood here. - [UBERTO] Hi, Donato. - [DONATO] Nice to meet you. [UBERTO] Come help me with this. - [DONATO] Where'd the shovel go? - Watch yourself. - Here we are. - [ARIANA] I have it. [UBERTO] All right. Work through the rocks. - [SALVADOR] Yeah, a lot of stones. Yeah. - [UBERTO] Yeah, right. - You gotta try with your other hand. - I'm sweating already. [UBERTO] Watch yourself. You've gotta put your back into it. That's it. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - Maybe the width is perfect? - Oh no. [CHUCKLING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [UBERTO] That's it. That's it. Now it's good! There ya go! [SALVADOR] Just toss them. - Yeah. - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [UBERTO] Nice! We're gonna have a real feast. [FIDDLE PLAYING] [BAND JOINS IN] - See what I mean? You like the taste? - You're right. How is it? Good? Ah, I've never seen her eat this stuff. [CHUCKLING] [GRUNTS] [UBERTO] By the way, this one. Try one. Come on. - Try. Try. - Is that it? - You'll like it. Go on. - Great. All right. Salud! [ALL TOGETHER] Salud! [IN ENGLISH] You should let us hear it. [CHUCKLES] It's practically finished, but it isn't ready yet. Have you heard it? Practically finished, but... Maybe I'll let you hear it because you're like family. [YELLS, CHEERING] [CHEERING] - [CHEERING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [MUSIC CONTINUES IN THE DISTANCE] But I can dance, you know? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You know I can dance, right? I mean, I was looking at Uberto's friend... Your dancing is beautiful. You did really, really well. - Wait, but are you proud of me? - Mm-hmm. I'm very proud of you. I tried. [ARIANA CHUCKLES SOFTLY] All right, I'm gonna go to bed. [ARIANA EXHALES] - Hey. - What? Well, I thought I told you that I don't kiss on the first date. Yes, that's right. That's right. I completely forgot. The memory of a gentleman. Forgive me. Fine, I forgive you. See you in the morning. - Hope you sleep well. - You too. - Thanks for tonight. - [ARIANA CHUCKLES] [SALVADOR SIGHS] Ah. [CHUCKLES] [CELL PHONE DINGS] SEND ME THE SIGNED CONTRACT! [SIGHS] STILL NEGOTIATING. IT ISN'T SIGNED YET. [CELL PHONE DINGS] YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR MONTHS IF I DON'T GET IT BY TOMORROW MORNING, SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR "WONDER PROJECT." [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [INHALES] The Scream by Edvard Munch? Yes, but this is my take on it because the other scream was really dramatic and sad, and I prefer comedy. [CHUCKLES] Did you know that this painting of his was inspired by a mummy that he saw from Paracas? No, I did not. - Well... - Is that near Lima, by chance? Yes, it's in Ica. Three hours from Lima. The culture of Paracas dates from before the Nazca. You've heard of the Nazca Lines? - I've heard. - Yes. I hope I get to see them. Life will lead you to them. [CHUCKLES] [SALVADOR CHUCKLES] Hmm? What? You have something to ask me. [SIGHS] Yes, I'm a witch. I don't tell everyone I'm a witch because they don't treat witches very well. But I see you with my witchy eyes, and you... [CHUCKLES] ...you have something to ask me. - Hmm? - Well, it's... I'm not selling the hostel. [CHUCKLES] Lichi, it's only 400 meters. It's... it's like less than half of this garden. Have you noticed that no one wants to talk about the beauty of aging? Well, I do. And I want to die here. And through my ashes, I want to be reborn as a happy tree in the sacred valley. Now tell me, what's more beautiful than that? With this offer, you can buy as many acres of the valley as you like and come back as a forest. Hmm. I can see why Ari has you under the microscope. I hope she finds something honorable. Hmm.

Hey, where are the brushes that Salvador bought? My workshop. Mm-hmm. [SIGHS] So, you're gonna sell? No. No, I'm not sure yet. You don't know yet? Am I stuttering? You just heard me say, "I'm not sure. I don't know yet." No, I don't know yet. You're having doubts. I mean, Ariana! They're offering me more money than I ever could have imagined in this life. Okay. I suppose everyone ultimately has their price. [SCOFFS] Listen, I'm not gonna sell them the hostel. I'll sell them a part of the garden, and then we can buy a piece of land in the valley. And we can finally have more animals. - And turn the garden into a bigger... - Okay. I think the time has come for us to part ways. - Ari... - No, it's already been eight months, which is way longer than I though I'd be here. Why are you leaving? Because I don't want to watch them destroy my memories of this house. Your memories will stay with you always. - What are you running from? - I'm not running! Who's running? [SCOFFS] You say goodbye here, you say goodbye there. You pick up and leave anytime you like. You say goodbye to people all the time. Are you afraid of missing something nice? You traveled for 20 years before you came here. - What did you miss out on? - [SIGHS DEEPLY] Don't be afraid of putting down roots, Ari. Only beautiful things will grow from you. [SUCKS TEETH, SIGHS] I don't believe in what's going to grow here. [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] [SALVADOR] Ariana! I don't wanna talk to you. - Just wait. - I don't wanna look at you. - Please, just leave me alone... - Wait a minute. - I don't wanna talk to you... - Hang on. Wait! What happened? "What's happened?" I don't like people who manipulate and lie. And that's what's happened. Don't touch me! - Where are you going? Wait a minute. - Leave me alone. Ariana! Please, wait! Ariana! Salvador, what's going on here? - Who is that crazy woman? - What are you doing here, Dad? - Yeah, happy to see you too. - I'm serious. Why are you here. Why am I here? I'm the solution to the problems that you're having here. I said I'd handle it, okay? Yeah, but I'm here to do you a favor. We have partners who... Hey! Here! Listen, our partners would prefer to invest in the marvels of Egypt because the manpower is cheaper, and If we don't find a solution right now, I'm gonna lose my investment. And you'll be relegated to remodeling forever. I'm here to make you take things seriously, okay? Come on. Let's go. All right, give me the progress report. What's up with that woman? This house costs the same amount as toilet paper in Spain does. Offer them more money. This isn't about money. That's what I'm trying to tell you. - [LICHI] I'm sorry. - Lichi. Forgive me. I didn't want to interrupt you. Madam, allow me to introduce myself. I am Alberto Campodónico. And I would like to speak with you. No, I'm not gonna sell. It's a good offer, but we're willing to sweeten... Please, Dad, this is not the time! - Do you know where she went? - No, I don't. We are Spain's largest hotel chain... Please, Dad. She already said no. Leave her alone. In the 35 years I've been directing this corporation, I have never taken "no" for an answer. - Madam... - [SIGHS] ...I would be willing to double whatever my son has offered you. But I'll need an answer from you, and I'll need it now. Sir, my answer is still no. It's no. Understood? I'm sorry, Salvador. - I'm sorry. - No. Lichi, Lichi, wait. Where the hell are you going? Whose side are you on? For the first time in my life, I choose mine. - [DOOR CLOSES] - You can't just treat people like that. She said she wasn't interested. Have some respect. Who do you think you are to talk to me like this? I just want to do things the right way. Because of that woman who's having a tantrum? Don't fuck with me, Salvador! You still haven't learned to separate these things. Business is business! That isn't the point. We are talking about millions of dollars here... You already have millions of dollars. And there are other kinds of business models. Our corporation won't be using any new models. Well then, I quit the corporation. Oh, so that's your solution? I don't feel represented by this corporation. [SIGHS] Thanks for the opportunity. [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS ANIMAL You really don't know where she could've gone? Some people don't want to be found. She mentioned the beaches up north and also Puno. - She couldn't have gotten far. - Yes, but she's taken all of her things. Should I even be looking for her? Will she even want to see me? You know her better than anyone. Well, life is full of surprises. But you have to be willing to let it surprise you. So, is that a yes? Lichi, help me out! Hmm. I've seen the two of you very happy together, and it's very rare to find that. Some people never find each other. Yes, and that's the most difficult thing to do. Harder than any job. - Right? - Definitely. So, what then? If you want my opinion, I'd say, uh, let's go with plan B. - [CHUCKLES] Hmm. - And what is plan B? Plan B. - What's plan B? - Well, plan B is... - It's plan B. B! - What is plan B? It's plan B! B, like existence. Like, find your place. B! So I should go, all right. Where am I going? Well, I mean, If you wanna go north, you have to take a plane, then you have to buy a ticket and they're expensive. She has no cash, so... - Puno! - She's always wanted to see Puno. - Head to the station! - Right! - Thank you, Lichi. I'll call you! - Mm! Good luck! [SIGHS] [BRAKES SCREECH] [INDISTINCT YELLING] You sure it's here? - [DRIVER] Yes, this is it. - Thanks, Javier. - [WOMAN] Over here. - Uh, yes. - Hello. How may I help you? - Hello.

Go ahead. - Thank you. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] CUZCO-PUNO CUZCO PUNO, 3827 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL.

Is she missing or something? - No, I'm just looking for her. - She's beautiful. If I find her, I'll keep her. [ALL CHUCKLE] Are you on vacation here? Sort of. But I have to go back to Spain. - Mm. - Mm. And you guys? - We're here to paddle. - We have a channel on YouTube. We do extreme sports. Today we're filming here, then we go to the coast. And from there, we go straight up to Mexico nonstop. [WOMAN 2] Literally. Great plan. I would love to go. Well, you can do it if you want. We have an extra seat in the van.

DEVICE FOUND LOCATION: PARACAS - ICA, PERU 1064 KM, 6 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL - [WOMAN] I'm so excited! - [WOMAN 2] What? Who is that? [CHUCKLES] - Should we record him? - [WOMAN 1] Maybe. - [WOMEN CHUCKLE] - [MAN] What's up, Columbus? [SALVADOR SIGHS] Still have room for one more? [ALL CHUCKLE] But of course! - Room for ten! - You going to the sea? - Yeah, to Paracas. It's in Ica. - [WOMAN] Hmm. Near the Lines of Nazca. It's like three hours from here. Yes, of course we know it. We're local. So, did you manage to find your backpacker? I think she's in Paracas. She activated my old phone, which is great. I thought it was dead. - Save it for the car ride. - Yeah, let's get you in here. - Jump in! Come on, let's go! - That's it! - [SALVADOR] All right. - [WOMAN 2] Start it! Come on! - Yeah! Video! Video! - [WOMAN 2] Okay! - We kidnapped a Spaniard! - [MAN] We caught ourselves a Spaniard! PUNO - PARACAS - [WOMAN] We're taking him to Paracas! - [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] THANKS FOR VISITING THE LAND OF THE LITTLE BULL [SALVADOR] Okay, so the trouble all started when... - [WOMAN CHUCKLES] - ...I showed up to build a hotel. - Which isn't happening. - [WOMAN] Good! She convinced you not to! - [SALVADOR] No, I decided on my own. - [WOMAN 2] Yes! - [MAN] She convinced you not to! Yeah! - [WOMAN 2] She did! She convinced you! [MAN] She put a spell on you, right? [UPBEAT MUSIC CONTINUES] [TRUCK HORN BLARES] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [MAN] Please, please, please! I need one of you to cover me at reception. A blue sea dragon has been spotted. - What here? - That's right. Here. What is that? Is it a kind of little fish or what? No, it's a mollusc that's endemic to Peru. It's very rare for it to appear here. It usually produces in five bays. And now it's here. I'm begging you, pretty please. As resident biologist for the last four years at this hotel, I've never taken a vacation. I'm asking you, please, please. - [CHUCKLES] It's okay. Go ahead. - Thank you. - Hey. - All right. See you. Okay, but why is it so difficult to find here? Because they tend to prefer to inhabit the very frigid waters of the Pacific, and it's very difficult for them to lay eggs. - The male is in charge of making the nest. - Mm. And then he performs an elaborate ritual for the female so that she enters the nest. If she deems his ritual acceptable, she enters, she lays her eggs, and then we never see her again. She leaves. Ah, so the dragon mama's crazy? - That's it.. - Wow, there's so much to learn from fish. - Are you ready to meet Memo, son? - [BOY] I'm ready! [MAN] Let's go find Memo! [BOTH CHUCKLE] Aw! How are you settling in? Do you like your room? - I love everything so much! - Aw! [CHUCKLES] And I'm finally here with you and it makes me so happy! I'm glad. [WATER SPLASHES] [CHUCKLES] What a funny old biologist. [SALVADOR] Basically, it represent duality. Each side opposing the other in exactly the same way. It's kind of like, uh, a bridge. Or like a ladder that symbolizes the link between two opposites. One from above and one from below. Day and night. Or light and dark. - That's cool! - Mm! The Incan Cross is thousands of years old. [CHUCKLES] Hey, this tourist knows more about my country than I do. My history teachers didn't teach us as well as you did. Mm. These are paciencia cookies. I haven't eaten them since I was young. How many did you buy anyway? [SALVADOR] Uh, ten, I think. When I saw their name I took it as a sign. I was very excited to buy them. - [MAN] I think we're getting close. - [WOMAN] Mm. [MAN] Yeah, this way. - Can I borrow your elastic? - It's your lucky day, Columbus! - The elastic? - Great. Thanks. - Oh yeah. Sure. Here. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. [MAN] Okay, we'll be there in two minutes. [BOTH WOMEN] Yay! [MAN] We're coming, Mariana! - Yup, yup! Mariana? Ariana! - Ariana! [WOMEN CHUCKLE] - [WOMAN 1] Yeah! We're here! - [SALVADOR] Ariana!

Good luck, man! - [WOMAN 2] Let's get our stuff out. - [MAN] Hang on. I'll be there in a sec. - [CAR DOOR CLOSES] - [WOMAN 2] Careful! [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] I think you might like this one. [GASPS] What are you doing here? Did you really think I wasn't gonna come looking for you? I didn't want to listen to you. And I still don't want to listen to you. Maybe it's because you're afraid of what I have to say. [SCOFFS] You think I'm afraid of you? [CHUCKLES] I've resigned from the corporation. And my job. That's the first thing. The second thing is Lichi misses you very much, and also doesn't understand why you left like that. And the third thing, and it's in no way less important, Porko and Rosita have become parents to three cuties who are already eating like big piggies. [SCOFFS] I'm glad. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [BOOK THUDS] And it turns out the hotel, the seven-star hotel I was going to build is not going to be built. And as for me, if you were wondering, I'm thinking about taking a yearlong sabbatical. I can't shake the idea of living by the sea for a while. Yes. [SCOFFS] It's a pretty tempting idea living by the sea, right? Someone once told me the sea heals everything. [ARIANA SNIFFLES] The salt heals everything. [SALVADOR SIGHS] Can you imagine a house on this beach? Built out of wood. With a glass ceiling - to be able to see the stars. - [ARIANA SIGHS] And a garden. Everything made sustainably, everything eco-friendly. [ARIANA CHUCKLES] All recycled. But won't you still be on your sabbatical? [BOTH CHUCKLE] [SALVADOR CLICKS TEETH] Have you ever been kitesurfing? No. You let yourself fly. You go with the flow of the wind. [CHUCKLES] [ARIANA] Oh my goodness! [CHUCKLES] Would you like to fly with me? [EXHALES] Are you really sure? But are you gonna be able to put up with me? I don't know. And you with me? [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] Doubt it. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Well, that's perfect because I think we're made for each other. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] [ARIANA CHUCKLES] You grab the rope like this. See the way I'm doing it? [ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [RELAXING MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES OUT]
