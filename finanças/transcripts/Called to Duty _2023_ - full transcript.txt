Relax, Ego. We're only a few minutes behind you. Focus on taking out that nuclear plant. Let the girls focus on distracting them. Okay. There's the shoreline. Stay alert. Eyes open, ladies. God help us. It's awfully quiet. How about I knock on the door with an old Mack, we can wake 'em up. I see something. It does not appear to be operational. Welcome to North Kiyung. Is any of this ancient military shit operational? This doesn't feel right. Something's wrong. Looks like someone's awake. What is it? What is it? Anybody see it? Country? Negative, no joy. Right. Missile. There! Warning, warning. We have friendlies down in the hot zone. I repeat, we have friendlies down in the hot zone. Come on. Don't cheat, yeah, don't cheat. Stay straight, stay straight, get up. Don't cheat. Two more. Two more. Last one. Put it away, put it away, put it away, put it away, put it away. Air Force baby, that's how we do it! - Let's go. - Yes, sir. - Congratulations, man. - Oh, man. Got it. - Congratulations. - Hey, thank you. - Good job. - Thanks. Man, hey, not gonna lie. That last one kinda hurt. Looks like it. Look, the Colonel's may run us some exercises, the next couple days, so try not to hurt yourself, all right? Especially with these guys over here. I'll be ready. I'm always ready, you know that. I know, last time out of here for a week, how much your arms hurt. You couldn't move the flight stick. Yada, yada, yada, yada. Oh, my gosh. No, no, no, no. - That was-- - No, come on, you can't do it, not this time. That was different, man. I had two guys on my back at that time. You were one of them. Okay. Just be ready. Are we--are we gonna go? Are we going to North Kiyung? Let's just say I got a hunch. All right? Just be ready for anything. Well, I'm gonna need a team. I mean, these guys at AFLA, they're good, but I don't think they can handle any of that. Gotta change up the simulations. Start focusing on those SAMs. Listen, we'll be fine. Come on, man. It's the red, white, and blue, baby. You know how we do. Now go get 'em. Angle to your departure. Frequency is 263.07. Target is six miles and coming fast. Here we go, Baby Bear. Hey, Edge, what do we got on the mission playlist today? How about something a little more subtle like Christian like this time around. Now, you're talking my language. Amen. Nah, I'm thinking rock and roll for this crowd. How about some Stealing Eden? Oh, I got just the track. Take it to Buster girls. As you know, North Kiyung has been performing multiple amounts of missile tests. At 0600 hours this morning, they managed to land one sixty miles outside the Russia shoreline. As we speak, the Navy is sending out a second aircraft carrier to the border of South Kiyung. Are we leaning more towards a strategic airstrike? The losses will be catastrophic. The last time we had a similar situation, we lost 2,800 fighters. We'd be sending off fighters to their death. Assemble a team of commandos and eliminate Kim Wun, one of the Joint Chiefs-of-staff recommendations. Eliminating Kim Wun would buy us some time, but it does not stop the missile production. We'd only be passing the reins to a pissed off sibling out for revenge. Why not eliminate them both? And then what? Kill his cousins, his uncles, his nephew, his girlfriend, son-in-law? If that's what needs to be done to save the future of this country. I think eliminating one man's family tree is certainly more beneficial to us than someone eliminating our entire country, sir. And I think the National Security Council would agree. Why don't you ask him yourself? Good morning Colonel. Colonel. Grace Daley National Security. So that makes 24 shows this year? That's affirmative. It's actually not that bad. Listen we have to-- Russian MiGs? The hell are they doing out? Let's get inside. I'm telling you, man, I was like Jesus up there, dude, I banked him. Just earlier today we had some unexpected visitors over the Atlantic Ocean when two MiGs flew just twenty feet off the deck of one of our Navy aircraft carriers. A spokesperson from the Navy tells us that they immediately scrambled four F-18 fighters to escort the MiGS back across the border to the Kuban territory. The MiGS claimed to be on a training exercise and stated they were simply saying hello to the carrier in their daring, unannounced fly by. I'm Brooke McKinley. Stay with us. We'll be right back. Yeah. Okay, next time we're up there, let me buzz one of their ships and see how well that's saying hello stories. - Yeah, baby. - Yeah. Woo. Man, they gotta change my call sign to Hollywood, man. I'm making the news. - Hell, yeah. - Hey, sweetheart. Wanna see what a real pilot looks like, huh? Funny, I didn't see your face on the report. Nah, I think he was talking about that special itch cream commercial after the news report. Now, that's funny. I'd expect that out of Riddles. Hey, do you--do you hear something over here, huh? Got it. - It's just a little wasp. - Get over yourself, Igor. It's Ego. But don't worry you'll get it Widows. It's okay. She flies planes guys, huh? Edge, no. Edge. How about I rip out your tongue and shove it up your ass? I mean, really? What's your problem anyway, Jeeter? Or is this some sort of grudge against one of your ex-girlfriends? 'Cause let me tell you something, you might be a pilot, but it don't mean you can fly and any one of these girls, including myself, will outmaneuver you in the sky any day. You see, just 'cause you got your name on a flyer and you do a couple barrel rolls and an air show once a week, see that don't make you a fighter pilot, honey. Your girls is doing tricks so people clap. - Right. - Big deal. - Okay. Really? - Guys, Commander's coming. Chill out. Commander. Is there a story behind this? No, ma'am. Literally just fell off the table. Air show went well today? Yes, ma'am. Another one in the books. Good to hear. Looks like you'll get headed to Maryland next week. - Good luck. - Excuse me, Commander. Um, we were wondering if we could possibly work on some maneuvering for the Maryland show and maybe we could borrow a few of the men for some... dog fight simulation? I don't see why not. If it helps with your show routine. I'll run it past the Admiral. Thank you, Commander. The United States has placed sanctions on North Kiyung and some of its financial firms in Giannia, in an effort to tighten the rope around its nuclear missile developments. We are learning now that a third US aircraft carrier is en route to its border. North Kiyung released a public statement today claiming that they will continue their ballistic... - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - No one. - No one who? No one at all 'cause we're all goners. They have been threatening us since way before our time. They're not gonna do anything. They're just a gum under the shoe of the old red, white, and blue. Speaking of gum under the shoe, thanks for taking care of that whole Jeeter thing today. Yeah, I don't know what it is, but that guy just does not like us. Don't mention it. It was just the right thing to do. Besides he deserved it. And furthermore, the United States is demanding the release of three Americans currently in custody in North Kiyung. One of them being Olson Walter, only 22 years old, the condition of the Americans is currently unknown. Those poor guys didn't do anything. They're just using 'em as leverage and they damn well know it. Did you guys know that their whole country believes America is just military? Yeah, I read that somewhere. They have like pictures of American military men torturing women in their school hallways. Yup. They think the whole reason we exist is just to attack them. Awful. Whatever it is, I'm an American. My family lives here. Now, that I'm flying is good enough for me. Speaking of flying, Edge tomorrow, let's keep it cool up there, yeah? That's the plan, Lieutenant. All right, TV off. Rec time, girls. Split 'em up and do what we do best. It's show time, boy. I'm not used to having a RIO flying with me. Hang tight little Bear. What's the rules, Jeeter? Rules are simple. Once we obtain a missile lock, you drop below the deck and sit on the bench until the rest of the wing chickies join you. And when we get a missile lock? That is highly unlikely, but if you do, Jeeter will buy you all dinner. Thanks, Stixx. Riddles, you and Bear are cloud jumping. Riot and I will skim the pool. Edge and Wiki, you're the sheets. - Get some cover. - Game on. Okay. And starting now. I want Country and Riot. You guys take the groupies. I got your groupies, Igor. Copy, bro. Eyes on lock. If he gets any closer he's gonna be the logo on my shirt. One more sec. I know what I'm doing. Taking her down. Let's see what you got. Hold on. They're right behind us, bro. - They're right behind us. - I see her. Oh, not today. Head locked and painted. Woo! One for the ladies. Damn it. Sorry, Jeeter. Another drink is on this flight. It's all right, Lieutenant. This comedy show is just about over anyways. - Did he say over? - That's what I heard. No! - Shit. - Damn, that was close. That's how they get you. Her range never pays off. Where'd he go? I see him. He's going head on. Tag it and bag it, Edge. Jeeter, you got Edge coming right towards us. Change course, buddy. No way, Stixx. This is exactly what we do. You might wanna tighten your buckle up for this one, Wiki. If we fail, we fail. Country's back. She's on our 6:00. Edge, fall back. Might wanna move, Lieutenant. If you don't break now you're gonna hit us too. This one's personal. Edge, move out. Country's got him. Not good. Not good. Country, get us out of here. Damn it. Shit! - Whoa. - Is that shit even in the handbook? And that's two for the ladies. Oh, my God. You're instructed to land immediately. Just great. I am in charge up there. When I give you an order, I expect it to be followed. And who's in charge when it comes to seeking out for our rights as women? Is there a captain or a commander or someone who's gonna defend my rights and my dignity as a woman? Can we serve the country just like the men? And you are. - Okay, guys, come on. - I am, yes. Under pressure, I am. You know damn well if I pulled out of that line, we would never hear the end of it. They'd be laughing at us even more. I'll be damned if I let any man label me or my team as anything less than equal. So what? Maybe I upset our government today and my superiors, but I know I stood up for every woman on the planet by shutting Jeeter's mouth. Look, I respect your Christianity and your devotion to Christ. You're supposed to love, forgive, and all of that. But my job as a pilot for the United States Navy and a member of this team is to protect us, and I will, even if it means dying. Now, I don't know about you, Country, but to me... that stands for something. I don't know who the hell authorized that ridiculous circus act. I understand, Admiral. I'm looking into it now. And I want someone in my desk or of yours, - within the hour. - Within the hour, sir. Good day, Admiral. Well, I don't think I need to explain much as I'm sure you overheard. You're losing control of your squadron, Lieutenant? No, ma'am. Today was a isolated incident and I've already spoken with Lieutenant Lee about the situation to assure it doesn't happen again. If I knew this was a contest on who's the better pilot or a contest of colorful actions, I would've never approved the exercise. Unfortunately, it happened. Now the Admiral wants someone to be held accountable. As the team leader, I must assume responsibility for my Wing Girls' actions, ma'am. You do realize that your wings will be taken away until further notice. You still wanna take that responsibility? - Yes, ma'am. - No, she doesn't. The flight recorder is going to reflect that Lieutenant Riebach gave me a direct order numerous times and I disobeyed Commander. Suspending her would be wrong and against policy, ma'am. Policy? What the hell do you know about policy, Lieutenant? You're really gonna stand here and try to educate me on the Navy's handbook? My apologies, I forgot you're a sea lawyer. No, no, no, ma'am. That was not what I was trying to say, wrong choice of words. You're damn right, bad choice of words. All of you get in here. As of today, the Wing Girls will be restricted from pilot duty and suspended until further notice. Consider yourselves rattled. Ladies, these aircraft are not toys. They're not for skylarking, they're for combat. I realize that your job entitles you to do certain aerial performances that a regular pilot cannot. But that's for 30 approved minutes a week. Not at your discretion and certainly not off and above my ship. I want you to know it saddens me to do this, girls. I've been tested numerous times in my career and I can't say that I wouldn't have acted the same way, but as your commanding officer and at the admiral's very heated request, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to ask you to pack your sea bags. You'll be flown to the airport in the morning. Dismissed. So how long do you guys think we'll be suspended for? No idea. I hear the Wing Girls are performing next weekend in Maryland if anyone wants to go. Oh, that's right. Show is canceled. Never mind. Hey, Edge, knock, knock. - Who's there? - Ida. - Ida who? - Ida rather be suspended with you than being on active duty with Jeeter. Thank you, Riddles. Hey, Country. Look. Not tonight, Billy. All right, I really cannot handle one more thing. - So unless you're gonna just-- - Look... I'm really sorry for how things went down today. It's just guys being guys. I hope you know that. Well, we certainly weren't discharged. We're just taking a small break. Well, I just want you to know that I think it's really great what you guys are doing, representing the women and all. I'm glad to have you guys here. I'd fly with you anytime. Is Jeeter in line somewhere behind you? Jeeter? Uh, well, I don't-- I don't really think so, but I do believe that he's receiving some punishment himself. Don't expect an apology from him. Jeeter will always be Jeeter. Anyway, I'm proud to serve with you. Thank you. I did just hear that, well, they might be sending a couple of us down to North Kiyung. It's pretty heated down there right now. Yeah, it's been all over the news. You know, be careful up there, Billy. That's not the most welcoming sky for fighters as we've learned. I'll keep you in my prayers. And Jeeter too. I hope to serve with you again, Lieutenant. I'd be honored. Good day, gentlemen. Today, we're gonna put you right in the heart of enemy territory. You're outnumbered, two to one. - Let's see what you got. - Let's get dirty. Only two? Come on, Colonel. I thought you were giving us a challenge. Hey, I'm okay with two. Of course you are, Poet. You're a rider, not a fighter. Ooh, splash one. No worries, boys. As soon as I down my bogies, come over for the leftovers. Here they come. And they hate smiling. On 1984, there was an actor that gave one of the greatest lines of all time. And what would that be? I'll be back. I'll take two high. You take two low. How's that sound? Oh, hell no. The Black man ain't dying first. You guys really fell for that? Come on now. Splash one... and splash two. What was that, 30 seconds? No, no, no. I think it's 31. You're slipping. Somebody get Bells his smiley face sticker so we can go home. There we go. It's only for a little while this time, Kaden. And when I get back, I'll be able to take you to the base. You can play with the simulator. You like that, right? I know, but I wanna go with you. I wanna fly with you. I know kiddo. I have something special for you on the piano, so why don't you go get it while daddy leaves. Okay? Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Go get it. Wow. I'm a pilot. Mommy, mommy, I'm a pilot. I'm a pilot! Mommy! Come here. Oh, hey. Oh, I miss you so much. Look what grandma got me, mommy. Wow, a fighter jet. That's very cool. Yeah, she said I got to start practicing so I could chase seagulls like you do. Chasing seagulls, huh? Well, you wanted a Christian daughter, that was the easiest G-rated way I could put it. Hey, look. Who's here? - Hi, Riddles. - Hey, Falcon. Look what I can do. Margo! This bitch gotta be kidding me. Margo, wake up! Hey, you can't hear me calling for you downstairs? It's kind of hard not to. Why do you want Tyler? It's my first day home. Can I just sleep in? Sleep--it's 8:30. Get up! Dad says you're gonna help me out with some stuff around the house. Yo, B! Calm them dogs down! Shut up! Isn't it a bit early to be drinking? I thought you said you were gonna quit once Mom passed away. Where the hell is Dad anyway? You think he'd be happy to see me. He's out doing a beer bar hop thing. Oh, a beer one. You know what? If my name was Coors Light, he'd be happy to see me. That's a hella way to talk about your dad. I don't need you coming in here, asking questions, acting all cocky, okay? I'm surprised Dad even let you crash here. And just show up unannounced. Are you listening to yourself? I'm his daughter, which makes me your sister. Not for nothing, dickhead. This is my house, too. It was your home, okay? Until you abandoned us for your air circus. Get up. You can help me with the trash. Dick. Now, in the Korean War, we lost 2,837 aircrafts and that was in 1950. Granted, our aircraft capabilities have grown substantially, but so has our missile stockpile. Colonel, are you giving us a history class here? Could you please just get to the point? As you saw on my test today, we were unsuccessful when evading the SAMs when dealing with two or more at a time. North Kiyung knows this and I can assure you, they will launch at least two per jet, at a minimum. This is where we're gonna need pilots with exceptional skills. Now, we don't have time to train for this, we need to attack ASAP. Now, in order for this attack to be successful, we need to do this in three stages. So what brings you to the Navy, Colonel? To put it bluntly, North Kiyung. Ah. A lot I could say about that. Getting worse by the minute. Washington needs to figure out something quickly. Well, that's why we're here. I don't know if you're aware, but we are from the Air Force Last Resort Operation Center. And currently, we're working a solution to shutting down North Kiyung and eliminating the constant threat of nuclear attacks. And one of your squadrons became a unit of interest in making this solution a success. We've already sent two aircraft carriers over and multiple squadrons to the southern border - for "training exercises." - I understand. However-- And I'm praying that none of those men have to be sent over to North Kiyung. I lost my husband there. And let's face it, we don't exactly have invisible aircraft to navigate around all those missiles. Well, the solution we are working on is classified at the moment. I can tell you that we are looking for your best pilots with advanced aerial capabilities. A squadron that can maneuver through such conditions. Colonel, I can assure you that we are working on advanced maneuvering with our pilots daily. However, you're asking for a bird to fly through a hailstorm. This is not one or two missiles we're talking about. I wish I could help you but unfortunately, I don't have a squadron with those capabilities aboard my ship. Sure you do. Absolutely not. With all due respect, Commander, this is in the best interest of the United States Government and the safety of its citizens. And with all due respect, Colonel, you're asking me to volunteer six women who are aerial stunt performers, not combat aviators. Besides, Lieutenant Riebach would never agree to it. She's a devoted Christian and she won't participate in combat, hence, why she flies for the aerial demo team. I was unaware that we offer the program flying a $40 million aircraft just for fun. They signed up to protect our country. Our government trained them for combat, not for carnivals. I'm quite sure if they refuse the order, they will be restricted from flying. And then, perhaps, we could offer them a job at the mall, handing out Navy brochures or be suspended indefinitely. Yeah. That one's not gonna work. They're already suspended, by our government. Well, Commander, I will have an order on your desk by day's end tomorrow to unsuspend them. And I can assure you, I will have the total support from the Department of Defense and our National Security Council to proceed with this operation. You will be hearing from us very soon. Good day, Commander. Dude, what the hell? Dude, what did they teach you in basic training? Come on. When's the last time you shot a gun? Keep your arms straight. Try it again. There's no way I missed that again. There's gotta be something wrong with the sights on. You scared the shit out of me. Nice shot. Try this one. They could take our wings but definitely not our guns. What are you doing here? I thought you're spending some time with your Dad. Yeah, well, Dad had a hot date with a bottle, so I wasn't too welcome. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. It's not like you guys want my family anyway. That's right. Wing Girls, fly or die. Oh, see? - Told you it was your gun. - Whatever. - Listen, my piece don't miss. - Come on. Let's go. Oh, hey, Country. Is your Mom around? I was gonna say hello and catch up? Yeah, she's inside, uh, go ahead. We're gonna go take a quick ride and we'll be right in. Kaden, Commander called. She said it was important. I think you need to return back to base. Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait. I'm on my time now. Hee! As of 0600 hours, you are reinstated for duty. However, for this particular assignment, you will be under AFLR's command. May I ask a question, ma'am? - Go ahead. - AFLR as in Air Force Last Resort Operation Center? That's correct, Lieutenant. Would it be out of order to ask for additional details, Commander? I don't have the details, ladies. What I can tell you is that the US Navy has agreed to assist with this operation and we will be docking on the Atlantic coast just outside the operation center. The Colonel and his team will be boarding the ship and running some training exercises with you. Jeeter has been selected as well. I expect you all to behave and represent yourselves professionally. Leave your grudges at the door. I suggest you get some shut eye. I don't wanna send them delirious, lazy-eyed pilots in the morning. Good night, ladies. Dismissed. I got a bad feeling about this. No one goes to AFLR unless they're going into combat. AFLR is boarding our ship, we aren't going anywhere, and that's not true, Bear. They may be just using us for stand-ins during training or something, okay? Let's just wait and see what happens tomorrow. But we finally get an opportunity to do something and Jeeter has to come with us? Really? We can always say no, can't we? Don't work like that, Riddles. Once you sign those papers, you basically gave them parental rights to your ass. Welcome to AFLR. I have to tell you I'm quite excited that you all are here. It's not--it's not often that we get a woman that comes through the Air Force Last Resort program, so to have six of you is quite rare, so welcome. Since you're already commissioned officers and well-respected pilots for our service, I think we can just kick the tires and light the fires, and get this thing going. We're gonna be boarding your carrier and running a series of training exercises. And during this training time, you're gonna be under Colonel Micklin's command. Lieutenant Riebach? Is anyone gonna explain to us what exactly we're doing here. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Sergeant. I'm sure you're all quite curious as to why the Air Force Last Resort program is interested in your services. Soon enough, we will fill you in on all those details. I need to see if you even fit the criteria for the operation. I am seeking the best of the best, and I expect nothing from you other than everything. We didn't choose you, it was your exceptional skills and abilities that did. Tomorrow, we're going to test those abilities, only faster, harder, and perhaps deadlier than you've ever imagined because it's one thing to serve your country, but when you're called to duty, will you protect it? I want you all to think about that. - Hi. - What's up, guys? - Welcome to AFLR. - No way. What's up, man? - Hi, guys. - Hi, guys. - How you guys doing? - Hello. What's up, man? Baby, how you doin', dude? Damn, who would've thought they're merging units, man? Oh, man. Oh, they ain't with me. Captain Middleton, call sign Mooney. I'd love to hear the story on that name sometime. Lieutenant Riebach, call sign Country. This is Wiki, Edge, Riddles, Bear, and Riot. Riddles, huh? You must be the comedic relief - of the bunch. - I try. Just so y'all know, Superman ain't got nothin' me. I'm just a call away. Travon Dixon, call sign Poet. Ah. Who would've guessed? You guys wouldn't happen to know, like, what we're doing here, would you? Uh, it's just what I was asking my pal, Baby, here. You know, what are we doing here with the Charlie's Angels, man? You know, giving us - some eye candy, yeah. - Oh, candy, no, man. That's sour candy, the kind you spit back out. Come on, guys. Really? That's okay. Really, we're used to it. Looks like we got us another Jeeter. Great. As if one isn't enough. Hey, there. I guess you felt a little left out. You know, that's my fault. I should've introduced myself. Lieutenant Lee. - Baby. - I don't care. Jeeter, apologize to my sisters. We don't wanna be here with you any more than you want to be here with us. But like it or not, you are flying with us. So, how about we just smile and get through this, yeah? Oh, I'm sorry. No, that's fine. I'll see you in the sky. We're gonna have some fun. All right. Later, Country. See you, Bear. I'm telling you guys right now, Jeeter wants to keep running his mouth acting like - he's-- - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh. - Whoa. - I'm so sorry. - Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Uh, perfect actually. Captain Harris. Call me Bells, please. Welcome to AFLR, ladies. Major Nikoli here. We call him Shortstop. There's no explanation needed. I'm, uh, Captain Billy. How do you do? I, uh, call sign Clownz. The only clown but I'm always hanging with a couple of jokes. But, uh, gotta go save the world, so I'm gonna leave you a couple of America's best, yeah? Right. Yeah. You go do that. - All right. - All right. Yeah. Anyways, uh, it's awesome to have you guys here. I'm really excited. We were just talking about this. I gotta admit, I'm a little star struck. I, uh, been watching you guys in your last few shows. It's pretty impressive. Well, thank you. I am sure you're pretty good yourself. I am. And I'm gonna make you guys better. He can ring my bell any day. I concur. - Really, guys? - Yeah, well, who knows? Maybe we'll make you better. We'll just--we'll just forget about that and... how about we compromise, let's say we'll make a good team? Yeah. Let's see how good you fly first. Lady's got some bite. I like it. Yeah. On that note, we're gonna hit the showers. See you guys up in the clouds? I think I'm already in the clouds. Uh, check to the 3-6-0. Feels good to be back up here, doesn't it, Bear? Who the hell changed the station on my radio? I don't know, but my seat is a little reclined back. That was probably Riot. She knows all about reclined seats. Guys. Ha, ha. Kill the chatter, girls. You heard the Colonel, zero tolerance. There are two persons of interest parked on top of Devil's Ridge. I need you to fly over there and get their ugly photographs. Copy? That's it? Damn. Okay. Easy first day. What? Air Force doesn't have enough money for a wedding photographer, Colonel? Angry Birds, your mission is to prevent them from getting it. Angry Birds? What? We got two eagles and a warning, incoming. Now this is one Charlie Foxtrot that I don't mind. And I agree this is gonna be an easy first day. All right, gentlemen. Let's keep it clean up here, okay? All right, Jeeter, Baby, and Bells. It's okay. Bear, Edge, and Riddles, you guys are gonna be the fly swat on the rear, keeping them busy. I'll take Wiki and Riot to the objective. Copy? - Game on. - Let's get it going. Operation Mug Shot begins in three, two, one. I see 'em, three of 'em. 12:00 high. Right behind you, Mooney, on your 6:00. Careful, boys. I know them, they're planning something. We're moving fast, girls. I'll take left. Riddles take right. Bear, keep point. Keep them off Country. I'm gonna skim the deck. I'm taking them down. Hey. They ain't gonna go that easy, Mooney. All right, ladies. Time to open the umbrella. - Got lock. - Take it. Dammit. That went well. I'm going low and right. Already on it, Jeeter. Get your own. I ain't bailing, no way. Time to light the fires and take 'em higher. - And there she goes. - Don't lose her, Jeeter. Quit your whining, I see her, and now I know why they call you Baby. Talk to me, Bear. We're gonna end this right now. Right above you, guys. He's all over me. Okay, girls. I got a maneuver that's gonna put us right behind them. But, Bear, I'm gonna need you to dive right between me and Riddles. Remember the Dosey Doe? The Dosey? Are you nuts? They could hit us head-on. Edge, that's not a good idea. It won't work if only three of you know the routine. It's too risky. All planes have to be choreographed. We're almost at the objective. - Sit tight, girls. - How about you focus on taking pictures and I'll focus on keeping them off your ass? Bear, dive now. Oh, hell no. Dammit Edge. Country, I'm going to help them. Do not leave my wing, they'll handle themselves. On my way, ladies. I see you guys. - Talk to me fast. - As soon as we meet, you're dead. Buckle up my little hamburger helper, we might be scraping a little paint. What the hell are these girls up to now? It's too close. Spread out. It's too close, Edge. Let's see if these guys can Dosey Doe. Wait, wait, wait, right arm or left arm? It's too damn close. Always left arm, always. - Three... - Edge? This is not gonna end good. I'm coming in, 3:00, through the middle. Captain, we should pull out. Two... We need to pull out now. Everybody, knock it off. This is not an air show. Let's go. Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning. Dammit. - One. - Look out. - Whoa. - Look out - Ha-ha, damn that was close. Woo. Dosey Doe! These girls are all over the damn place. I told you. Lock 'em and dock 'em, team. Splash one. - Shit. - Mooney is called Boomey, game over. Let's make that two. Poet you're through. Splash one. Woo! Ah! Jeeter and Baby are out of there. Back to the birdhouse boys. There's our objective. Let's see who our guests of honor are today. Say cheese. Wing Girls, one. Angry Birds, zero. Good job today, guys. Pucker factor was definitely high, but good job. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. I appreciate you. I do. I would take a missile for you and you know that. The next time you disobey my order, I am dismissing you from this team. Do I make my myself clear? Crystal. What I saw today is unacceptable. You all have to remember that you may serve under two branches, but you fly under one flag. We are the last line of defense to this country. He's protecting your family. She's protecting yours. So, when the alarms are going off, and that MiG is preventing you from seeing your family again, it's not gonna matter who's saving you, if it's a male or a female. You can ask any pilot, any pilot that's had a missile or a MiG locked onto them, that feeling you feel, it's indescribable. Dramatic situations bring people together, unfortunately. So, let's start now. Let's not wait for the alarms to go off. Colonel? The only thing you managed to prove to me is that these girls can take a picture and their lack of communication in that ridiculous maneuver that almost cost six lives and six aircraft, Colonel. - But it didn't, did it? - Thank God, no. Had it? I'd be talking to you from behind a plate glass window - in prison right now. - You haven't even seen - what they can do yet. - I don't know. And if I'm not mistaken, we gave them a mission today, and it was completed. And that's what we train our military to do. Get the job done, isn't it? Colonel, do I need to remind you where you are and who you are speaking to? Now, proceed. - Bear. - Hey, Margo. What's up? Taegan, wait. Look... you know if I thought for even a second that if I was putting you in harm's way, I wouldn't have done it. This team is literally all that I have. So, uh... I just wanted you to know that. I know that, Edge. Cool. So, they didn't fill you in on why you're here, I suppose? I was thinking they wanted us to fly the new F-35s. Ain't for no F-35s. See all that? That's what scares me. No. We're an air show team. We don't-- no. My girls and I don't do combat. Unfortunately, you don't have that choice if you're here. Just keep that in the back of your mind. It's all so dark and mysterious when the one you want doesn't want you, too. Cute. Is that one yours? Backstreet Boys. He's got charm. You gotta give him that. Well, well, well. Who we got here? It's the legendary Wasps. This is the crazy one. Tell me. How did it feel to bump your head falling from heaven, huh? Well, I didn't fall from heaven. But I did scrape up my knees and my legs pretty good crawling out of hell. Something wrong with this girl. Come on. Look. You girls, you-- you're a government-funded gimmick, all right? Look. I don't know whose daddy knows whose daddy to get you here, but don't you put my life in jeopardy again, all right? If I'm not mistaken, you were chasing us. So, say it like it is. You're mad because you were outsmarted by a bunch of women. - Okay. Okay. - I see. - That's enough. - Yeah. Don't be screwing the pooch on this one. That's fine, man. I'm out of this pig palace anyway. Come on. Go back to your bitches, Jeeter. Yeah. Don't mind him. He's in heat and he's miserable. - To Wing Girls. - Wing Girls. Okay, ladies. In today's training exercise, we're going to focus on your air-to-ground precision skills. This will be missiles only. Proceed through the canyons, to the convoy target. Take it out. Oops, a little rusty. Sorry. Circle back around and get in line. Lieutenant Rossi, you are go for your attack run. Copy that. Target visual, and fire. Shit. Just to clarify, this is the squadron we're sending into North Kiyung in a few days? Lieutenant Beckett, initiate your attack run. Copy that. Switching to guns. What the hell is she doing? Target acquired. Negative, Lieutenant. This is missiles only. Damn. That felt good. Nice one, Riddles. Bring them home. I've seen enough. Send the girls packing. Oh, you said missile. We thought you said miss all. That's what it sounded like to me. That's what I heard. Well, hell, coming right up. FOX 2. Fire, FOX 2. Woo! What else you got, command? Tomorrow, you will advance to stage three of your training. Now as a squadron, you are very advanced and certainly an asset to this operation. But, individually, you are lacking a lot of combat experience. Operation? Today, your ability to follow orders was both disappointing and embarrassing. Whether it was one of you or six of you, it's still unacceptable. So with that being said, none of you will be flying anything if you don't start working together as one. I suggest you all take tomorrow off and find something you can do together to set your differences aside and get along. You can't fight the enemy if you're too busy fighting yourselves. He did say operation. What does that mean? Definitely eliminates the possibility of training for new jets. They can't possibly think that we're capable of flying in any type of physical combative operation. They have 17,000 pilots in the service. Yup. And only 700 women. Six of them are right here. Would you guys listen to yourselves? You're pilots for the United States Navy, and if you have a chance to go down in history protecting your country, you do it. Down in history, yeah. Down behind enemy lines? Yeah, I just don't know. As the United States plans to meet with the President of Xiangyu today, Kin Huan has tested a rocket believed to be capable of mounting onto the ICBM missile that he says "will turn Americans to ashes." Uh, yeah. Speaking of. You might wanna reconsider that statement. I mean, it's ridiculous. I don't know how he just hasn't told them how it is. We're going to battle. No one's saying you're wrong for saying that. Somebody need to tell these girls this, get their mind in the right place. But unfortunately, you, I, us, we don't wear the medals to make that decision. I mean, they're out here, acting all reckless like it's some damn spring break freakin' air show. You can't do that. This is war, baby. There's no choreography in war. That's right. If that missile wants you, it's gonna get you. Or die trying. If Colonel thought they weren't good enough, they wouldn't be here. Hey, what are we, chopped liver? You're a nurse, not a pilot. Whoa. Big difference. I'm gonna go talk to him right now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What did you and I talk about, man? Remember, remember, daddy-daughter time. Go spend your time with your daughter. When you come back, then we'll deal with all this. - Right. - Families first. Right. I'm gonna go hit the showers, see you guys in a week. All right. Good luck. Let's give them the Raptor. Incoming. F-22. Let me guess. They want us to catch that thing. Wing Girls, you're clear to simulate engagement. Let's paint it. No joy. Country, you got it? Negative. I got 'em. Shit! Lost 'em. I got 'em, Edge. Lost 'em. Damn it! Where'd he go? If this isn't the shit show of all shit shows. Excuse me, Council. You need to take this. It's Washington. Mr. President. Understood, sir. Twenty-four hours. North Kiyung just launched a long-range missile. Get them out of the sky, we attack in 72 hours. We could use a little more time. We're not near close to ready yet. Well, I suggest you get them ready. There is a long-range ICBM in the air as we speak. God-willing it's just a test, but it might not be the next time. Now, these girls were your plan. Break the news to them. Their next air show is over North Kiyung. As you know, we have a situation that is escalating rather quickly with North Kiyung, a threat that needs to be addressed immediately. Told you. The training exercises you've participated in over the last few days were crucial in determining the success of this mission. We are confident that each and every one of you will be able to provide the air superiority we need to keep this country safe and end this threat immediately. Ms. Daley? Gentlemen and ladies, I'm going to dispense with the sugarcoating material, and I'm gonna throw it all out on the table as boldly and as clearly as I can. Thirty minutes ago, North Kiyung announced that they will be firing missiles at Guama. We have just learned that they are now a nuclear power. They have repeatedly threatened our families here at home. This is unacceptable, and they must be stopped. If you are sitting in this room, you are the answer. By ignoring this threat, you are putting your country in jeopardy of a nuclear attack. You are going to be flying in the most dangerous skies in the world. The chances of survival, on a scale of one to ten, is a four. In three days, you will attack North Kiyung. - Wait, what? - Is this really happening? We do not accept these orders. Excuse me? I apologize, Council. But my squadron is not a combat squadron. We were brought here without a clue as to why we were being trained and had I known that we were gonna be sent to combat, I would've refused from the very beginning. Colonel? Lieutenant, we discussed this. You discussed this with your team, not us. I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna watch my sisters die in the sky of North Kiyung. We are a demonstration team, sir. Not combat. I'm sorry. Ballistic missiles are being - coast that spy satellites had detected activity - What are you doing? ...long-range missile has recently... Packing. You should, too. They're just gonna suspend us again. - But I'm not gonna wait. - So that's it? You're just gonna pack up and leave as soon as your country needs you? My husband died flying my wing over North Kiyung 15 years ago. I watched him get blown to pieces before my eyes. If anyone understands your fear, I do. But if I had to go again, I would. And he would want me to protect my country. Think about what your father would do and what he would want. And that's where you'll find the right answer. We have some very unfortunate breaking news out of Washington. It's coming in right now. Olson Walter, the 22-year-old student that was previously imprisoned in North Kiyung, has died at his home this evening from the brutal injuries that he sustained while being imprisoned. North Kiyung leader Kin Huan has released a statement. He promised every American citizen will scream in terror now that he has an ICBM capable of reaching Los Angeles, and possibly even Washington and New York. I'm Brooke McKinley. Please stay with us. We'll be right back. All right. Joe Wilson, live from the Pentagon. It's always a pleasure to talk to you. Thank you. All right. Tensions are still heating up across the West as we have just learned that North Kiyung launched yet another test missile. That's seven missiles total in the last three weeks. The Department of Defense will be joining us shortly and briefing us with the latest developments... Look, if you give me just a couple hours, I'm sure I will come up with something where I can-- Well, I suggest you think of something because in approximately 60 hours, we're-- I will protect it. I'm sorry? It's one thing to serve your country. But when it comes down to it, will you protect it? I will. And I'd like the details of the operation, sir. Oh, Colonel. Hey, um, I'll catch you in a minute, okay? Okay. Uh-hmm. Shouldn't you be in final briefing? Can I speak freely with you, Colonel? You know, just Kaden to Julian. Sure. What's up? Um... I just-- I really wanna make sure that there's no more hidden agenda. I mean, my team doesn't fire a single shot. We cross the border, distract them a little bit, and Squadron-2 comes in and does all the dirty work. We all head home together. That's it. Can that be a promise? Lieutenant... you're going into a battle zone. -I mean-- -I need that promise. Sure. I promise. Okay. Thank you. Please forgive me for what I'm about to do. Watch over me. And be my wings. We're gonna hit them at sunrise. The nuclear facility is buried 60 miles in the mountains of Baganiya. In order to get to this facility, unfortunately, you'll need to get past their coastal defenses. Wing Girls will be leading this operation as a distraction team. You will be referred to as the Iron Angels. Stay below 5,000 feet. Get as close to the coastal line without being picked up on radar. Once you break the 200-mile mark, it's gonna become a very uncomfortable situation very quickly. They're going to throw everything they have at you. Just do what you do best. Give them an air show they've never seen before. Squadron-2 will punch through and take out the nuclear facility. Once Squadron-2 takes out the facility, you can pull back to the Sea of Jafnia, your safe zone. You'll be in and out 20 minutes. Make us proud. That's why they call them clowns. Hey, Bells, What the hell happened? Well, Washington gave it the green light. First wave just left. Green light? Uh-hmm. Tell me Country and her team are not on that first wave. What, you want me to lie to you? Give me airborne now. Negative. Colonel's got you on alert, Bells. I said now. Attention, aircraft, this is Falcon Riebach from the Wing Girls. You are flying in restricted airspace, please identify yourself or I will take you down. You're a girl? Ha-ha-ha, no way, American scum. Bring it on. Almost got him and FOX 2. Thanks a lot. He got away. Tss. Nah, he just got scared. Didn't have to shoot them. And you still saved the world. I'm Lieutenant Claymont. I fly with your mother. Thanks for your service. Well, you are definitely Country's daughter, that's for sure. And I would be her father. Hey, Dad. What? No salute for me? Uh... Lighten up. I'm just messing with you. How can I help you? Yeah. First of all, I'm sorry. I guess I--I guess I should have knocked first. I actually have a special package from Ms. Riebach for her daughter. It's a letter and she wanted to make sure it got to her as soon as she was airborne. May I? Yeah, sure. Go right ahead. Can I open it now? Whenever you'd like. Why don't you go take it and read it on the bench, sweetie? "If I know my little Falcon, you're probably in the middle of some important fighter pilot training when you were interrupted with this letter. You're always training and preparing for your time to own the skies. And one day, you will. I just wanna let you know that mommy and daddy will support you in whatever you decide to do with your life." "Being a fighter pilot seems really cool when you're looking up from below and watching these machines fly past. It is a lot of work. You are going to come across many obstacles and I want you to know that no matter what you decide, I will always be proud of you. In my eyes, you will always be my little Wing Girl. Please try to get along with your father. He loves you so much. If you ever need to talk to mommy, just look to the sky and I will be there for you. Someday, as mother and daughter, we will chase eagles together." How you guys doing? Anyone awake? Yeah. I'm ready, Captain. Any pilot that can sleep before a preemptive strike, better pilot than me, man. Huh? Huh? Sorry, sorry, I was sleeping. Did you say something about a preemptive strike? Oh, splash one by Baby. Yeah. Okay, Baby, did you bring an extra diaper with you? You're gonna need it. Only if you're changing it. I wanna be a Navy pilot. How about you, Country? How your you girls doing up there? I'm okay. A little nervous. Just enjoying the sounds of the Indian night-noises. You're gonna be just fine. Got any preflight jokes to bring break the tension up here, girls? Negative. I honestly can't think of anything right now. I just wanna say whatever happens up here today, it's been a pleasure to serve with you, ladies. I mean it. Thank you, Baby. We appreciate that. Oh, come on, serve with them? Met them like three weeks ago. I'm the one who served with them. Not the time for pickup lines, Baby. That Mr. Ego getting overprotective of the sour candy you wanted? You got something to tell us, Ego? Jealousy is the pain a man feels when he is not equally beloved by the person whom he entirely loves. Yeah. Perhaps you'd like to give the prestrike toast and share some words of encouragement. Stage is yours. Okay. Awkward. Okay. Okay. All I have to say is I don't know how the hell I got stuck saving the world with a bunch of women. Come on, man. - But-- - And here we go. But at least when all hell breaks loose and they fail on me, I'll be okay, because I'll still have Country and the Wing Girls to get me home. Oh, okay, you got jokes. And I'm honored to fly with you. All right, Angels, you are weapons-free. Godspeed, everyone. It's happening. All right. Here we go. - Oh, shit. - Okay. Let's not fall apart now. Remember the plan, let's ring alarms, let's do a couple tricks, and get out of here. Can we do that, team? Let's do it. God, I'm nervous. Now is not the time for nerves here. Time for piloting. Wiki's, right. This is the biggest air show in the world right now. That's why we're here. The audience, they're hostile, and they do wanna shoot you down to prevent you from seeing your family again. So instead of being nervous, let's get angry and make these bastards surface. - Agreed? - Agreed. We fly in together, we fly out together. That's right. Wing Girls for life? Wing Girls for life. Now let's go save the world. I don't feel right being back here, Mooney. I should be up there with them. Relax, Ego. We're only a few minutes behind them. Focus on taking out that nuclear plant. Let the girls focus on distracting them. Hey, there's the shoreline. Stay alert, eyes up, ladies. God help us. It's awfully quiet. How about I knock on the door with that old Maverick and wake them him up? Radar should have detected us by now. Strange. I see something. It does not appear to be operational. Welcome to North Kiyung. Is any of this ancient military shit operational? This doesn't feel right. Something's wrong. Ever get the feeling like you're being watched? Looks like someone's awake. What is it? What is it? Anybody see it? Country? - Negative, no joy. - I got nothing. It's gone. Nothing here. I think it was a false alarm, guys. Sky, - keep ringing detecting any uglies in the area. We picked up some activity momentarily. Be cautious. It's an ambush. Get them out of there, Colonel. That signals them locking out of on to their coordinates. No wonder why they do so many missile tests. Shit don't work. Yeah. I believe they said we'll be flying in the most dangerous skies in the world. Angels, we are picking up multiple missiles. - Missile! - I got incoming! There! - We got missiles! - Guys, look out! Flares out. No. Wiki! Angel - I've lost control of the aircraft. Wiki! No one goes to AFLR unless they're going into combat. We aren't going anywhere. Angels, you have multiple bandits airborne. Keep them away from the guys or this mission is a failure. Warning! Warning! Warning! And eliminate those missile sites now. All right, son of a bitch, let's go! I got visual on the MiGS. Distraction coming up. Time to burn some gas and kick some ass. Angry birds, you need to get to that objective. The Angels have been compromised. They are holding those MiGS off momentarily, but it might not be for long. Move it. Sorry, fellas. I'm going after the girls. You heard the order, Ego. We're going to the objective. Can't do that, Cap. Those are my girls. Good luck. Shit! That's it, fellas, let's bring it over here. Now that we're face-to-face, let's do this introduction properly. This one's for the girls. On my way. That's it. Keep it coming, boys. Ah, shit. - A little help up here. - I'll be right there. Got three left on me and one off windows. I'm taking the shot. Bandit down. Riddle! Mayday, Angel 3, I'm going down. No, no, no. Get down, Bear! Motherfuck... I need an update now, Goddamn it. Mayday, mayday. This is Angel 2. I took a direct hit. All systems are - Fubar, and I got a MiG still on my 6:00. I'm not gonna make it. Yes, you are. Jeeter. I'm right behind you, Edge, I'm blocking the shot. You want got to eject. Get out of there. I think I can make it back across the border, just a little bit longer. Just got locked. He's locking me up, Edge. Almost there, Jeeter. Just a little bit longer. Oh, shit. He's firing. - Hit. - Jeeter! Warning. Warning. Warning. Warning. - Made it. Made it. - Eject! Edge, bad news. - My hydraulics are down. - FOX 2. Clear, Jeeter. Get the hell out of there. Eject. Eject! Edge, do you copy? Edge? Skykeeper, we have friendlies down in the hot zone. I repeat, we have friendlies down in the hot zone. I'm currently assessing the situation. Standby for orders. Country, I'm coming to you. Listen, I need you to get a grip. We're in a lot of danger right now. I need you to stay on my wing and I'm gonna stay on yours. Okay? We can talk about this and grieve later. Can we do that? Yes? Shit. What the hell did that bastard just say? He said, "Girls can't fly combat." Believe that shit? Attention, aircraft. This is Lieutenant Riebach from the United States Navy and I am the last voice you're gonna hear. That's my girl. Let's drop. I got him. Splat. Nice shot. Come on. SAM incoming. You handle the MiG. I'll keep the missile busy. Country, wait. Shit. I got you. FOX 2. Bogie down. Country? Country! Today is not only an anxiously proud day for the American people as the airstrikes against North Kiyung's nuclear facilities were successful. But it is a somber one as well. Seven of our brave men and women who selflessly sacrifice and devote their lives to keeping us all safe are reportedly missing behind enemy lines. We lower our flag in the hopes that they are alive and with the intention of bringing them home safely. I'm Julia Dalton. Stay tuned. We all head home together. I promise. Okay, thank you. Oh, hey mom. There you are. The commander called and said something about they found Edge. Yes. The doctor will be with you shortly. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Is she okay? - Calm down. Please tell me she's okay. She's home. That's what's important. But she, um, she's, um, she's in a coma, Kaden. Oh. Huh. Margo, can you hear me? This is your father. I know I haven't been the best dad in the world to you, but I promise I'm gonna make it up to you. You really need to know that I care for you and I love you very, very much. You're a strong woman. I know you're gonna get out of this. Country. My job as a pilot for the United States Navy and a member of this team is to protect us. And I will, even if it means dying. Can I offer you guys something to drink? Some coffee? Maybe some scotch? I'm fine. We're fine. Thank you. I spoke with Commander Mosko today. She said Edge really hadn't improved too much. How you doing? Are you okay? How do you think I'm doing, Colonel? Look, Kaden...I know. - I know that-- - You promised me. There was no way... I could have predicted what was going to happen up there. No one could have. I have reason to believe that a lot of them are still alive. What? This conversation, it stays right here. - Yes. - Captain? Of course, sir. The UN uses a channel what's known as the New York Channel, which has been an avenue of communication between the US and North Kiyung. Well, a few days ago, they made a statement regarding American prisoners. Pilots, specifically. They're alive. How do we know they're not bluffing? Couldn't they just be saying this to gain some sort of leverage? Because they said... the prison camps have never smelled so beautiful before. My girls... and that son of a bitch. What's the plan? We can't just let them sit there and...you know what they do to Americans in those camps. Well, unfortunately, there is no plan. Not right now, anyways. We are trying to dissect exactly what they meant by that comment. But unfortunately, the lines went dead within the last few days. And after everything that's happened, I can assure you... it's gonna take an act of God to go back in there again. It just so happens... that I am very close with God. I'm getting them back.
