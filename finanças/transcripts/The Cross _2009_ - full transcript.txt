[Music] [Music] [Car honking] Hey, watch where you're goin'! [Radio static] [Speaking in foreign language] --Carry the cross that was hanging--and around the world. --With his cross planning to travel the country, where people are looking for help. --On a mission from god. But for those who cannot leave their homes for lack--or fear of looters--Arthur blessitt came to them to pray. For 30 years, he's walked the earth, carrying his 12-foot cross and an unquenchable desire to spread the word of Jesus Christ. God bless you! Sometimes people see me carrying the cross and they shout across the street. Hey, you're a nut. I say, don't worry about it. At least I'm screwed on the right bulb. God bless you, sir. Peace be with you. God belss ya. People laugh sometime, and I realize that probably I would laugh at somebody carrying a cross also. God bless you, brother. God bless you, friend. Peace be with you. People will say, but Jesus has already carried the cross. And I understand that. I really do. God bless you, friend. God bless you. Good morning, god bless you. Peace be with you. Anything I could pray for you about today? God loves you. God bless you. I never thought of ever making a cross. Never wanted to make a cross. Never wanted to carry a cross. I had lived my life knowing Jesus and sharing about Jesus and the message of the cross, but not a cross. As I grew up I never owned a cross. Never wore a cross. Was really never attracted to the symbol of the cross. Anything I can pray for you about? Just happiness, health and happiness for my family in Australia, yep. Okay, I walked across Australia, yeah. I've been walking around the world since 1969. Where are you from? Ghana. Ghana, I carried the cross through Ghana. Uzbekistan, I've been there. [Speaking French] [Speaking Spanish] I went through France in 1972. I started in Hollywood, California in 19--well, 1968, I made the cross, in 69, started walking around the world. And I've been through your country. Well, yeah, how you know where I'm from? Well, I don't know where you are from but I've been through every nation in the world. Here I am in Tunis. This is Denmark. --Fields of Cambodia. Bangkok, Thailand. Macau, China. [Inaudible] Bali. The south pacific. Mongolia. Babylon. North Korea, Jesus did. The island of Niue. United Arab Emirates. Beautiful day in [inaudible] Somalia. Jerusalem. Yugoslavia, Japan, Lithuania, Moscow, Christmas Island, Norfolk Island, lord howe island, east Seymour, spitsbergen, in case of polar bears, easter island. Here we are in the galapagos. Mount Kilimanjaro. Antarctica. Bolivia. Damascus, Syria. Chile. Okay, I think you get the picture. And if you haven't figured it out by now, this is Arthur blessitt. At 68 years old, Arthur spent the last 40 years carrying a 12-foot wooden cross through 315 nations, island groups, and territories, 52 war zones, through deserts, jungles, mountains. He's been arrested 24 times. And Arthur estimates that he's walked some 38,000 miles or 76 million steps. For those of you playing at home, that happens to be the equivalent of one and a half times around the earth at the equator. Well, I've just been dying or living to have a Jesus cheer in the heart of Amsterdam. And as Arthur himself has already pointed out, it's almost conveniently easy to write him off as some bizarre oddity or maybe even sincere wacko dragging christianity even further into the depths of irrelevant. Give me a j. E. S. If any of you penguins can understand me, Jesus loves you. The maker of heaven and earth. The one that made you has sent the cross to you. Oh, hallelujah! And in your own special way, penguins, you too praise the lord. The guinness book of world records has even inducted Arthur into their fine annuls for the world's longest walk, right alongside the likes of ahritta furman, who holds the record for the greatest distance walked with a milk bottle on his head, and Gary hatter, longest lawn mower ride. Yet, for Arthur, you do get the feeling that carrying a cross has a bit more purpose than your standard-issue Hollywood publicity stunt. Calculating the number of steps that I've taken, and the load that I've carried, it has been over 16 billion pounds of weight on my feet step by step. But, many times I felt that the greatest weight of the cross has been within my heart. As I see the injustice and as I see the pain, and as I see suffering, as I see the hungry, as I see the wars, as I have people stopping that are suicidal, people that are bound by alcohol and drugs, I carried their burdens in my heart. And I pray for them. And many times it's not sweat running from my face, but it's tears dripping as I see the hurting, suffering, lost world and god loving them through the cross. Now, for the sake of full disclosure, I've known Arthur for most of my life. Yet even to me, he's always seemed something of an enigma. Disappearing on the road for months, even years, then suddenly popping back home like a faithful hound dog who's been forging through the woods. It had been nearly 20 years since I last saw or had even spoken to Arthur blessitt when we bumped into each other this past summer. He had just got back from Zanzibar, where I was surprised to hear that he had finally completed his mission of carrying the cross through every nation, major inhabited island group, and territory in the entire world. And for the first time, the enormity of what Arthur had been doing all these years made a real impact on me. I soon found myself kind of wanting to follow him around with a camera, wanting to discover what made this guy tick. Arthur, are you really making a difference? And why does it have to be a big, giant cross? I remember carrying the cross out in the Jordan desert before the first Gulf war when the refugees were fleeing out of Kuwait through Iraq. Many of them had been robbed. Others had had everything taken from them, and raped, and terrible stories. What's our message? We don't have food. We don't have--i mean, what can we give them? And I would stand and say, god knows your name. God knows where you are. They needed that message as much as they needed food to eat or a passport home. They related. God cares for you. And Jesus suffered. And he lost everything. You've lost everything. But through his suffering, his death at the cross, then we are made rich by his mercy and grace. And they would sit there crying and smiling. Hello, there, sirs. Give you a little card there that reminds US that god cares for US, that he loves US. I believe that. Yes, yes. I'll believe it when I see it. I believe. Amen. I do too. I don't. I don't believe there is a god. So what motivates you everyday? Staying alive. And then, whenever that day comes because we are all getting older, when our last heartbeat comes, then what do you think? I think it's just like when you go to sleep and you don't dream, that's the rest of your life right there, not dreaming, just gone, you're gone. Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in god. Yeah, yeah. He loves you. He cares for you. But I am still hungry, you know. I have nothing to eat. Like the homelessness, the drug addicts, all this [bleep] around here, and she's talkin' about that [bleep]. Can I give you one of those? God bless you, friend. Jesus knows your name and he loves you. He cares for you. He can give you a new life. That's why he died on the cross. For hope. He brought peace that passes all understanding. At the cross, Jesus knew one day you would be sitting on this rail in the park and he sent me by with the cross to remind you to follow him. That he loves you. And not to give up. Let the anger go and let the joy of god come in. [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] Father, I lift up her son. We trust him into the care of Jesus. Knowing that all power is in your hand, we pray for your comfort in our heart with the loss of this precious child, but may the love of god and the peace of god fill her life-- and his work and his modeling and his travels and his safety. And I pray you would turn everything around in his life beginning this week in Jesus' name. Would you say lord Jesus, come into my heart. I want to know you, I want to be with you. Would you pray with me, Richard, say dear god, would you do that, Richard? Dear god, I need you. I open my heart, come in, Jesus, I've had the cross on my arm but I want it in my heart. Make me a new man in Jesus' name. Amen, amen. One of the most important missions I think that I've had in this 40 year journey has been reinterpreting the cross. For centuries, muslims have been in conflict with the cross. And yet I carried the cross openly in every Muslim nation on earth, through the smile, through the love, through the message that at the cross, the worst of man met the best of god and that god cares for US, they saw it in a new way or I would'nt be alive today. ♪ This I know ♪ for the Bible tells me so ♪ ♪ little ones to him belong. ♪ ♪ They are weak, but he is strong. ♪ [Children laughing] ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me a lot of times I've walked into a village, and either in Egypt or Iraq or Iran or wherever, and the children come running up to the cross, and they're just little children. They don't have any Christian teaching or really hardly any islamic teaching or anything else. It's a man carrying a big board with a wheel on it. And they come up and they're sticking their toe under it and making the cross roll over their toe and then they ride on it. And I'm dragging them through town. And the people in that town, they see the friendliness of the cross. It's now their cross. [Singing in foreign language] Regardless of your opinion about a guy who walks around the world with a giant cross on his shoulder, the facts are hard to ignore. I mean, when you hear him start telling some of his stories, it's like how is it that this guy is even still alive, how is it he hasn't been taken out by a jihadi sniper or wild animals or malaria or a big old nasty green truck? It was like god was saying, blessitt, you got more miles to walk, more nations to go to. I know that as I walk humbly before him and seek to line my life up with his will and purpose, that I am totally covered by his sovereign will. Is there something truly special about this man? Could it be that, despite appearances, he's like an old testament character walking around in modern day or at least the closest thing to some kind of a super prophet we are likely to see in our generation. As we look at history of mankind, we see the walls, the separation, and the barriers that have been erected by politicians, by governments, and yes, even by religions. But at the cross, we see that all people are the same, irregardless of their religion, their color. The first time that I was arrested was for shaking hands with a black man in Jackson, Mississippi. This African-American man, I was talking to, I held his hand, stood there praying with him. An angry arms pulled me back and said in words I would'nt use, what are you doing here shaking hands or holding this black man's hand? And little did I know that I would be holding hands of every color all over the world! That's unbelievable. You were arrested for witnessing to an African-American? Yes. I mean, the police, they said what are you down here from up north? Are you some integration agitator? I said no, I go to Mississippi college. I was born in Greenville, Mississippi. Well, don't you know you're not supposed to be shaking hands with a black man? And I said no. I thought this was america. I'm free. I'm free to shake anybody's hand I want to. And they stuck me in the police car and took me to jail. I mean, I wasn't trying to make any kind of statement. I was just loving everybody on the sidewalk, minding my own business, and sharing the love of Jesus, but then, no. I will be back. They said don't you ever come back and do this again. I said i'MMA be back. I said you're not telling me that I can't shake somebody's hand and pray with somebody. And it was the first time that I knew all this kind of defiant fire was in me. I had never--i didn't know it was there. But i--this is not right. This is not. It was an awakening for me in many areas. Was Arthur's path even more radical? A road beyond mundane religion on which all of US have been called to walk. Whatever the case, it soon became apparent no one could tell Arthur's story but Arthur himself. You know, and I'm just a sinner saved by the grace of god who's been on a journey ordained by god. And the people have welcomed it, every Buddhist country, hindu country. And it is--i don't know. This is my companion. This very cross here I carried over the hindu kush. In Iraq, in Iran, Saudi Arabia. Sudan, Somalia. I've had so many, many, many, many thousands of people that come to the cross and they touch it. And then they rub themself. They--and I say, oh, but it's god that's holy. I'ts not the wood, it's not this wood. But like, this wood is my friend. And if it could talk, it'd have a lot of stories to tell. Every one of these chips and bangs and bongs on it has a story.

[Music] First came to Hollywood, California after reading in the newspapers about the hippie movement that was happening on sunset strip and then at Griffith park. There were love-ins at Griffith park. And there I showed up with my flat top haircut and a suit and a tie. And all of these hippies were there smoking grass and partying, and I started giving out gospel tracts, little pieces of paper with a message of Jesus on it. And I was talking to one guy that seemed far out. And he said hey, man, why don't you get up there and tell them all about it. I stepped up on stage and suddenly out of me came words I had never shared or spoken in my life. How many of you want to get high? And everybody, yay. I said then pray. You go all the way to heaven. How many of you want to get loaded? And everybody cheered. And I said then load up on a little Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. And it changed my life. Down the sunset strip in Hollywood, California, any time day or night and find "his place". "His place" is the home of the minister of sunset strip. And he's inviting you to visit with Justin time and some very special people. A former biker chick, a bike club president, a convict, and a prostitute in "his place". Here's Arthur blessitt. We welcome you to "his place" here on sunset boulevard. We know that you're going to enjoy the testimonies that are going to be shared here around the table. "His place" is kind of half way between a church and a night club. That's a weird place to be. I began full time walking the streets of sunset, going into the night clubs that would let me in, and finally bill gazarri let me have what he called Arthur blessitt's gospels at gizarri's night club on sunset strip. And from there, with andrae crouch and Jimmy Owens singers, we were packing that place and sharing Jesus. What brought you here to sunset strip? Well, about 8 months ago, I was really deeply lost in sin and prostitution, drug addiction and just about anything you can name that was underhanded I was into it. Well, I was walk down Hollywood boulevard and one of the Jesus freaks from "his place" came up to me and started rapping to me and showed me a tract and invited me over to "his place". And we hitchhiked on over there. And I got the lord that night. Then I felt Jesus speak to me and say I want you to put a big cross on the wall. And I didn't want to put a cross on the wall. But there that night, I realized that yes, I had to make a cross because Jesus told me to. When I got ready to lift the cross up, I realized I didn't have a wrench to tighten down the bolt that held the cross beams together. So outside one of the hell's angels came up on his motorcycle, and I said, hey, Tom, I had been going to the hell's angels camp and ministering there. And I said have you got a wrench? I need to borrow a wrench. He said yeah, man, I got a wrench. Came walking in our building. And he said what do you need? And I said right there, I need that bolt tightened. He said, what is that? And I said that's a cross. 12-foot cross. He said here, you take the wrench. You do it. And about 3 days later I walked through the building. And I saw Tom standing, looking up at the cross and I walked up beside him. And I said, Tom, what's happening? And he said, man, every time I go down the street on my motorcycle, there are crosses all down the street on all these churches. I never saw them before. And I realized it was my wrench that tightened down the center bolt, and you said my sins put him there. Tell me more. For the first time, I then realized the power of this real life-sized cross. And then, from time to time, we took down the cross and we'd go down sunset boulevard. You see, we love to share the lord. We like to use what we call reds. Reds are these little red stickers. I mean, up and down the strip, and they ask speed, grass--and everything, so we got our reds, we go up to somebody and hey, man, can I turn you on to some reds? And they say far out. And say okay, so we just wheel off and stick them with a red. You know, these reds got glue on the back. They'll fit on police cars, phone booths, you know, they'll fit--anywhere you can stick these reds. ♪ I heard the lord calling me ♪ ♪ out of the sleep and then we would come back to "his place" and a crowd of young people would follow US back into our building where we would have Jesus music jams. And then I would preach at midnight. It was very strange because I had been up preaching at a night club called the cellar at about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. As I got ready to go to bed, Jesus spoke to me so clearly, Arthur, take the cross off the wall of the building, and put it on your shoulder, and carry it on foot across america, and identify my message where the people are. I was ready to do it. I was ready to be obedient to his call, but it conflicted with, first my desire to be on sunset strip. I loved being the minister of sunset strip, working with the young people. And I think the way god rationalized it to me was the sunset strip stretches around the world. [Siren wailing] And suddenly I had a prick of a pain on this side of my head. Very quickly, began to be numb and partially paralyzed on part of the ride side of my body. The doctors were saying it looks like you need brain surgery for this aneurysm. I said I'm supposed to leave in two weeks to carry the cross across america. And I know they thought I needed brain surgery for sure. But they said you can't lift anything heavy. You can't exert yourself. A strain could burst those aneurysms in your brain. And, laying in bed, I said, Jesus, what do you want me to do? And he didn't speak. Most of the time he does. And it was very strange to me. And I thought, why aren't you speaking to me, lord? You called me to carry the cross. You said leave Christmas day. Here I am with a brain aneurysm and sick in bed, and then I realized something. He had told me what I was to do. And now I thought my circumstances had altered his call. And laying in that bed, I learned a life lesson: Circumstances don't alter the call. And I said I'd rather die in the will of god than live outside of it. I got up out of bed, I flushed the medicine down the toilet, and less than two weeks later, on Christmas morning, put the cross on my shoulder. It was difficult to speak. It was difficult to walk. But I thought, I'll die with the wind in my face but I'm not gon' die flat on my back in some hospital somewhere. Started down sunset boulevard heading toward Washington, DC.

The ira controlled zones of Belfast. And I was carrying the cross through the middle of that fighting, going down through one side and back through the other. And there were a group of men standing there. And you--they said you've crossed into our area. Go back. And I said no, we're carrying the cross saying come to Jesus. Jesus loves you. He's the solution. They said, this is our area. If you cross that next street up there, we're going to nail you to this cross. And they had big nails and a hammer. And these were tough looking men. I knew it was one of those moments that would define the rest of my life. I said, men, we'll be there in just a few minutes. We're going to pray. We'll be at that block. You've got to do what you've got to do. I've got to do what I got to do. I walked up to the men. And I had little round Jesus stickers that say, smile, god loves you. And I started sticking them on their shoulders and saying Jesus loves you, he died on the cross for you. We can have a prayer. He can give you a new life. And they just looked in amazement. And they said, didn't you hear what we said? And I said yes, I heard what you said. But I don't think you meant it. And I just slapped him on the shoulder. I said, you guys look like you're nice guys. I said god loves you. God--you don't have to live this life. You don't have to behave this way. There's something bigger. I said, would you get on your knees and pray with US? They said, oh, just keep going. Just keep going, just keep going. While Arthur was certainly showing that he was not lacking courage, his stories didn't seem to helping too much in the sanity department. Sure, lots of missionaries had spent times in dangerous places, but add in a 12-foot wooden cross, and it would only seem to make things harder to get his message heard. Is a giant cross really necessary? As with most questions you ask Arthur, his answer comes via another story. We're here at the hill of the crosses, which embodies really the heart and soul of Lithuania. Three times this hill was bulldozed down by the communists to destroy the hill of the crosses. But each time, it Rose again in faith. We kept hearing about the hill of crosses. And I was very, very interested in seeing this place. But I was not prepared for it. Because as I came upon it, you suddenly see this hill, and there are thousands and tens of thousands of crosses. But when you realize that it is people under the oppression of communism trying to destroy any belief in god, that every cross represented some family's statement of defiance, and I looked, and I could only weep. But there was a little crowd of people around. And they were there, they had shovels. An American had come bringing the cross, and they were ready to dig a hole to put my cross up. And i--no, no. No. And I realized that it was part of the message of really interpreting the cross to people, giving it a new definition. All the crosses they'd ever seen anyone bringing, they were leaving. But mine, they got the point. He's carrying his. He's going somewhere. He's spreading a message. And the next morning, when we got ready to leave, these people were all gathered around and they were crying and they were kissing me and they were hugging US and they were kissing the cross. And they sent US off. And it was a revolution. Because I was the only one that brought a cross and left with the same cross that they had brought. So many people feel that the cross is against them. They look at the cross and they think, oh, the cross is against my sexual orientation. Or I've had an abortion, or I drink beer, or I smoke cigarettes. And so god hates me. The cross is the sign absolutely, clearly, indelibly imprinted that I love you. That's what the cross says. I care. I came down and I got involved in this mess that some people call life and became flesh. And sacrificed himself with his hands nailed to that cross with his feet nailed, with his side pierced, saying, I'm with you. I love you. I care. I learned many, many years ago that the way to change the world is letting Jesus come and change US from the inside out. We don't need a hand slap. We don't need a pointed finger of condemnation. People know they've got problems. They know that they are not perfect. But they're looking for a way out. That is what real conversion is all about, is that if any person be in Christ, they are a new creation. They're a new existence. Christ who died and Rose again now lives in them and they're changed. There's no battle. They don't want it. They don't need it, they don't desire it. No. They don't want to turn to violence anymore. They don't want to live the life they've been living because they have a new desire. It's their nature has changed. Now, some people have obviously real hang ups. There are some people really hurting. But you know what I noticed? That even terrorists, even the worst people that are killers, that will fight, that have just killed their neighbors across the street, when you get, and you start talking with them, you find out that they love their children. There's so much beauty in them, but there's a bad distortion. And god can change that. Where did you come from to get to west Beirut? Well, we were in Sweden. And I read of the terrible tragedies taking place here. I was carrying the cross across Sweden. And we--my heart was broken. We must come to pray for peace. And so, we took a plane to Tel Aviv. And then I rented a car and I drove to east Beirut. When we got up near Beirut airport, all of a sudden-- [booming] There was firing, tanks firing, missiles going. The whole place exploded right in front of our car. Joshua started screaming. Daddy, daddy! And I said, Joshua, I'll turn around, take you back to Jerusalem, but I have to go on. He put his head down, put his hands over his head. And then he looked, not at me, but just straight ahead. I said Joshua, if we take off in this, you may die, I may die, but there's no coming back. I mean, we can't decide half a mile down the road to come back. This is it. And Joshua said, daddy, let's go. I cranked up the car and we drove right into this. [Guns firing] We were in the middle of war. There were two monks hitchhiking. And so, we stopped and picked them up. And they said, we're at the monastery up here in the mountains overlooking Beirut. Come up and spend the night. Told 'em we were going to carry the cross into Beirut, and they said one of our priests was killed today down there. They will kill you. And for supper, they gave US the last rites. And they--me and my son, Joshua. And then we ate, I guess it was like the last supper. And so we laid down and I'm looking out the window, watching the bombs blast and the tracer bullets firing where we were headed tomorrow morning. I suddenly see a mosquito. [Making buzzing sounds] I'm telling you, if I tried to make up a story, I wouldn't make up one this good. I mean, I promise you, in heaven they'll have a video of this. But this mosquito's goin' [Making buzzing sounds] And I get my hand ready to kill him. And then I think, I'd like to watch how a mosquito actually bites you, what they actually--i said, they tell me i'm going to die tomorrow, so have a feast. If you bite Joshua, I'll kill you. But if not, you can have all of me you want. So my hand's up there, and this mosquito lands right here on the little hairs on my arm. And I'm watching. And he moves himself around like that, gets his head up and, boom, you know, puts his little nose down and goes...Starts shaking, flips over on his back, dead. I can't believe it. I pick up his little legs, lay him over by the little candlelight that's burning. He's still there the next morning. I mean, he's just dead. And I'm thinking, wow! And the lord spoke to me. Tomorrow night, you'll sleep in west Beirut. He didn't say you'ill die. He said you'll sleep in west Beirut. [Guns firing] Next morning we get up, we go down, the Israeli troops, no. I mean, there's firing. No, no, no way in. My paper. No. And so, Joshua and I went over by a building, sat down. Leaned our cross up against a post and prayed. And it looks absolutely hopeless until I hear a voice saying, what are you doing? What is that? And it was an Israeli man. I said it's the cross. And he said, did you walk from Jerusalem to Cairo? I said yes. Two years ago, across the sinai. He said I was a tank commander and I brought you food and water remember when all those tanks came up? He said, that was me. I often wondered if you ever made it. What are you doing here? I said, trying to get in to west Beirut to pray for yasir arafat. He said, man, we're trying to kill him. And he drew me a map on a piece of paper, and I still have that map. And he said you go down here. And then you get to this, and you turn, and he said it's two blocks of landmines, but that's the way in. And he said, god have mercy on your soul. And he turned, tears swelled up in his eyes and he walked away. And we start walking fast. Israeli soldiers are hollering. You know, come back. Come back. And we walk in between five fighting armies. And I'm holding Joshua's hand and we're saying--I'm saying, you know, oh Joshua, I said, which way do you think we should go? I don't know, daddy. Pray. I'm praying, daddy. I'm praying. And then we come up on a big pile of dirt and steel and an anti-tank barrier, stepped up to the top and there's all these guns pointed at US. And a guy says what are you doing here? I said--he said it in English. And I said carrying the cross. We've come with good news. And he said, if you've got good news, you're welcome. We can stand all the good news we can get. Come on in. And Joshua and I walked in. Soldiers were rushing up to US, they were trying to give US cigarettes and drinks and tea. They were so excited to see US. This is Muslim west Beirut. All of a sudden, there's a noise, and around the building steps yasir arafat. He has come to welcome US. Peter arnett of CNN filmed it. The evangelist Arthur blessitt from Los Angeles described himself as a follower of Jesus, and the cross was for all people. Can I say a prayer? Father, I pray in the name of Jesus for your peace. I pray for your peace in all this land, that there be no more killing, there'd be no more death, and that the dreams and the hopes and aspirations of all people shall be filled. I pray for you to spare the life of this man and blessing on all the people, and oh god, may know one else die. We love you, we love you, Jesus. And we thank you that you brought US here through many dangers, that we may stand for justice and love and peace. And may there be no one else die in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen, amen. Thank you. Thank you a lot. The people said you will be shot carrying a cross. No one wants you with a cross there. But that's, of course, not true. We've been welcomed. We're here for peace. The god of Abraham says let there be peace. It's awesome to see how that the people in the worst and most difficult places are many of the ones that have welcomed the cross the most. The people you would think would want to reject you have seen the cross going through their battlefield. And instead of pulling the trigger, god pulled on their heart, and they responded. [Music] Matt crouch, who is directing this film, has been trying to get me down to the real hard stuff of suffering and what is really bad. He says that in a movie, there needs to be bad things and then happy things. When you're down in the jungles and you go for just days and you don't have toilet paper, there's nothing but banana leaves, and it's just bad. The women would chew corn. And there's a big pot sitting in the middle of the village. And every time they walk by it, they go [spitting] They spit, and they give you this to drink. It's chewed up corn spit with juice. They hand you to eat the choice piece of meat. A monkey leg, with the leg--the hand still on it, and the meat peeled back part of the way back down to the hand. And you really just kind of shake hands. You're holding this hand that looks just like a little kid. And as you bite in, you're pulling on the tendons and the fingers wiggle. Oh, that's about as bad as it gets, Matt. Dangers and critters, you're laying there at night on a hammock, [making animal noises] And it reared on its legs and [squealing] Just as the lady opens the door, I'm goin' oh, oh, eeh, oh. As I was squatting there, I saw the grass begin to shake. And I know it was a worm 'cause as a kid, I fished and we used it for bait. I think the worst toilet experience was, again, Japan. It's so high-tech. Everything from perina to--and bush master snakes that strike you, and I didn't see any of it. It was too much vegetation. You punch this button, then this button, then this button. I hollered Jesus! And just jumped. And this crocodile came right over where I had been squatting. When I looked at it, I said, I can't eat it. And the interpreter said you've got to, grandma cooked it. So we punch this one--there's a big flow of water just, shoo, washes your whole bottom. Boom, before it even hit my stomach, it was on the way up faster than it went down. And I had to just leap into the house and start stripping off my pants. There was this juice. It was like vomit. It was pink. It was like pink vomit. And you punch this one, and then there's hot air, whoosh. You look here and there are all these people just grinning at you. And you know, this is what they spit out that you're eating. If you punched them in the wrong order, you didn't know what you were getting. It was awful. It's getting up relentlessly every day. Every day. You just--most of the time I carried the cross from daylight until dark. And you're on a--you're walking from North America to south america. You're walking across Africa. And it is hot. And you're sleeping and you're itching. I remember one time--maybe the tough--i was going across west Africa and I'd been walking and there was a missionary guest house, and you can go there and you can just rest. And I looked forward to that for probably two months. To just get in that air conditioning. I thought, I'll stay there, like, maybe three days. Maybe two days, I'll just stretch out--i just want to get where it's cool and just rest. And I got there. I was standing there with the cross and I said I'm Arthur blessitt. I said, i'm walking across Africa. And they've been telling me the last couple months about the mission compound here. And I said I'm willing to pay. But they said that you had air conditioning, and I would love to get a room here just--and rest up for two or three days if you didn't mind. And they said, you know, we only have missionaries. It's not open for the public. You know, we're not a motel or anything. Just missionaries. And I said, well, I mean, i'm--mercy, I'm a missionary. I've been walking from Sierra Leone. That's like 2000 miles backed away. I said, and I preach every day. I said, I'm an ordained minister. And they said we thank you so much, but we just--you're just--we just do regular missionaries. We just can't let bypassers and backpackers and whatever stay. And I said thank you, thank you. And I walked away. And I was so hurt. You know, I guess even carrying the cross, I'm not a qualified missionary. I don't have a badge, I don't have any card to say i'm anything. I'm just carrying a cross. And as I walked on probably not over half an hour down the road, a car pulled over, puegot, a white puegot, and I won't forget it. And this guy and lady got out of the car. And they said, wow, said, we've been hearing about you. Somebody called US and said you were coming a month or so ago. And then we heard something at the school. Said, we're school teachers. Said, now, we're atheist. We don't believe in god, but we have a house just up the road. And we have an air conditioned room, in one room. And if you would, we would love to have you stop at our house and just stay as long as you want to. I said, are you serious? And they said yeah. They said are you okay? Said, you look like you've been crying. I said, oh, I'm okay. I said, I'm all right. And they just moved out of their bedroom and they fed me and I rested. And it was one of the most moving things in the world that here these atheists were the ones that welcomed the pilgrim with no credentials for the mission compound. [Music] In arabic, there is a word that the arabs use. In sha'Allah. Whatever god wills. And when you get to that, there is an incredible freedom. It all has to do with the way we look at god. Is god our friend? Does he love me? Is he really with me? Jesus said I will be with you always. Not conditionally. Not based upon our circumstances. Always. And when you know that, that he is present no matter what is going on in your life, there is confidence, there is lack of fear, there is boldness, and there is an assurance that what he wants will come to pass. So, when you can accept that, then you're free. I remember carrying the cross in Italy after meeting with the pope. I was carrying the cross to assisi. And I was trying to just walk in the spirit and life like Saint Francis of assisi, and had left behind all baggage, and was cold and it was snowing and sleeting and rainy and the wind was blowing. And in the night, I felt that I might have hypothermia and actually die. It was so cold. And I remember stopping. Had the cross on my shoulder and I looked up and I said, lord, in the name of Jesus, stop the rain, stop the wind, stop the cold. And, shoo, rain, the water started pouring and the wind blowing and the sleet started coming down more than ever. And I remember looking up and I just said I love you anyway. It'll take more than sleet and snow and cold to quench my love. This is what you have for me tonight. Hallelujah! Crossing into Nicaragua, was in middle of the civil war between samosa and the sandinista guerillas. It was a very, very explosive situation. I had a four-wheel drive vehicle that a friend of mine, Mike oaten, was driving, and another friend, Don price, had come to spend, like, two weeks with me on the road. And Don said the people are saying don't spend the night here. Anything along this road at night, they'll Rob, steal, kill. And I said, I've never run in my life, and I'm not starting today. About 2 o'clock in the morning, there was a bam on the door. Stepped out, and then for the first time, I saw half a dozen or so gunmen raising their guns up, pointing 'em at me. I heard this man saying, uno, for one. And I thought, I know how to count to three, I don't know the word for fire, but it went through my mind, I'm not going to die without a Bible. I could see standing around me now the gunmen, their feet, and they're pulling on my shoulder, trying to get me to stand up. And I get a little hole in the box and I rip it open and I've got my hand on a Bible, and I'm so thrilled. And then, I think I'll give 'em all a Bible. And I just fill my arm up with bibles, stood up with one in my hand, and nobody was standing there, and I look, and probably 15 feet away, there are six guys laying on the ground. And I think, wow! And I walk up and I say, would you like a Bible? And then they run to this truck, get on the back of that truck, and the truck takes off down the highway. And I'm standing there in shock, amazed. And I said, wow! Those guys I think were serious. They were going to kill me. What happened? And then later, we noticed outside that this whole village of people had gathered, and they were on their knees outside the door, and they said, we saw a bright light. God was here. Honestly, I was disappointed. I was ready to die, and now I got to do this all over again. I was absolutely prepared, ready to step into eternity and be with Jesus. And I realized that god had preserved me. It was--to me, it was almost a sense of humor, like the lord was saying, you're not getting out of this so easy. You've got a lot more miles to walk. You've got a destiny to walk into. It's not over now. You haven't even finished half the world yet. I realized that, for me, and for anybody, the safest place to be is in the will of god, when you're in the will of god, and he determines that you'll make it, you'll make it. In 1979, Arthur's view of the sovereignty of god was put to the ultimate test. He found himself facing one of the deepest, most impenetrable jungles in the world, the Darien gap of southern Panama. Of course, it was becoming quite clear to me that, to Arthur, there are no tests, only opportunities to experience god in new and unusual ways. Local military officials told him that attempting to cross the Darien was suicide. No one had ever made it through alive. Undeterred, Arthur recruited two faithful friends, one an ex-green beret to accompany him on the dangerous journey and to help with the heavy supplies that would be crucial to their survival. Less than one week into the jungle, both the friends turned back. I think at the very moment that the second guy decided to go back was one of the defining moments of my life. It was a very alone feeling. Not lonely, because I knew Jesus was with me. But very alone. I had heard that I had to have them in order to make it. And now both were going back. And I stood there in shock. And I knew that whatever was my destiny, I had to go forward. Jesus said walk from north america to South America. He didn't say take a boat around the difficult place. And I knew, for me, I had to go on. I could face even death by going on, but I could not face that haunting agony that I would have felt had I stopped and not tried. I knew when I walked into that river, that god knew whether I would make it. And to me, that was enough. And it was a very awesome time in my life because the only one that spoke English was Jesus. And I enjoyed his company. And I enjoyed his presence. And I knew that from that day forward, nothing, nothing ever would detour me from trying to obey. I may fail, but if I fail, I will fail falling forward, not sitting down, not ruled by fear. Now, the Darien jungle has steep mount peaks going in almost impenetrable mangrove swamps. The rivers run straight down from the mountains. Steep cliffs on both side of narrow rivers. I would come upon a stream, you would have to get down maybe 30 feet, maybe 50 or 75 feet with the cross, sometime holding on to vines, lowering yourself down to the raging stream, get the cross across, and then try to go up a steep ravine almost straight up. And I would hang the cross up on the vine or something, pull myself up, get it up higher, pull up, and sometime, you'd get almost to the top, and everything would break and you're falling, and there's rocks down below ya, and you're hollering, Jesus, help me. It's been a long hike over land and then part of the way by boat from yaviza. But as we've been carrying the cross and coming into the little villages, people have been taking the stickers, and we've been sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. The lord seemed to have stripped away my interpreter, and my Spanish is very poor, and it's just, everything that is being done is just god is doing it. It's not by might nor by power but by spirit, saith the lord. One of the most difficult things for me has been to leave little villages. I could just stay there, live there. I so wanted them to see the meaning of the cross. None of them spoke English, and it didn't seem like they understood Spanish, they were speaking their native language, choco. And I felt Jesus tell me to do a drama. And I took the cross and I was doing the drama of the crucifixion of Christ. And the people were looking at me. And then I began to weep as I thought, oh, god, they need to understand. I so want them to see your love and to see the love that the cross represents. And as I was weeping, I looked out, and people were crying. And then I went up to the children, and I would say, Jesus, Jesus, and they...I'd go--touch their lips, Jesus, Jesus, and Jesus. Yes, Jesus. And then I got the children saying Jesus. And I'd point to the cross. And then I would point up. And then I would point in the heart. And before long, the adults would say Jesus. And when I left the next day, I left with a great shout of Jesus, and they were shouting back Jesus. There is perhaps no better story to symbolize why Arthur does what he does than to visit the Plaza mayor in Madrid, Spain. It was 1972, and Spain was still under the dictatorship of Franco's fascist regime. I didn't even know what the Plaza mayor was. I ask a news reporter. I said, if you were carrying a cross and you went to Madrid, where would you go? And he said, the Plaza mayor. I said, the Plaza mayor it is. I'll be there, and I gave the date. And then, as it got closer and closer, pastors began to tell me, wow! This was the place of the inquisition. Over 100,000 people had been martyred in the Plaza mayor. And now, again, the suppression and the battle to have any kind of religious freedom was a struggle that was going on in Spain at this time. I carried the cross under these arches, looked out, and there was just about, it was completely full, holding about 20,0000 or 30,000 people standing body to body inside the square. Pushed our way to the center of the square, lifted up the cross, and I started to preach. A hush went over the crowd. And in the back, the civil guardians, the storm troops of Franco. And then this officer steps up and says, you know, take the cross down. Go. And I said no. I stand with those in the past who have been martyred. Whamo. I was knocked down. The cross fell down. And one of the most amazing stories of my entire life took place before my eyes. One of the pastors standing nearby grabbed the cross and started lifting it up, and others rushed up, grabbed the cross, lifted the cross up. I'm laying flat down, trying to get my breath. And then they start clubbing these pastors who are lifting up the cross, knocked them down. And then other people in the crowd come running up to keep the cross up. Lift it up, lift it up. It was this thrust toward--and they knew what was happening. And yet, you could hear the bam, the boom, it was on one part suffering, brutality, and yet praise began to fill the whole place. I was drug by my heels to a police car that was sitting there and was stuffed in the back. And I looked back and I just saw old ladies, little kids, everybody running to the cross, trying to lift it up. And these men beating them to the ground. And then the police car drove away. That was the last sight I saw. All through the Plaza mayor, the believers started giving their testimony and sharing about Jesus. So instead of having one preacher, they now had multiple preachers preaching all over downtown Madrid. The soldiers, so moved, picked up the cross and stood at attention facing the cross in the Plaza mayor. And then they were going to let me go, but they wouldn't let the preachers go. And I said, no, we all go. We were all arrested together. We all go or none go. And finally, they said, okay, we'll let everybody out. We got to get this done with, over with. The people in the church were praying and crying because they knew their pastors may be in jail for months or years because of this riot. And here we all come in free at midnight. It exploded. Your ears were ringing. It was like a miracle. All 30 preachers and the cross all out of jail. This is looked back upon now as one of the major historical points in Spain was that day in the Plaza mayor when the people again were beaten afresh, but not since. There are now witnesses, churches, preachers, freedom of religion and Spain has been beautiful. It's one of the greatest things that I've seen god do worldwide. Many people have dreams and visions of doing mighty things for god and making an impact in the world. That was my prayer also. And then Jesus said, lay it all down and let your vision be no bigger than the next person that you meet. And following that, it has carried me around the world. ♪ I boast not of works. ♪ Or tell of good deeds. ♪ For not have I done. ♪ To merit his grace. ♪ Oh, glory.

Yet, I can tell you the one thing he never had to do over 40 years, and that's wrestle 140 hours of footage and interviews into a 90 minute movie. Yet, as Arthur told US one amazing story after another, more than we could ever include in a movie, something very interesting began to happen. The more we listened, the more we found ourselves way more interested hearing about what the cross did to Arthur than what Arthur did with the cross. It was as if the stories, you know, didn't really seem to matter anymore. And to Arthur, that meant the world because we were finally beginning to understand. I know people are fascinated by stories. But I'm not a walking story. What moves me is my relationship with Jesus. And my relationship with people, individuals, one by one by one. I wasn't walking to try to find a war to go through. Why was I going through the Darien? Because there were people in there. Nobody stops me on the road and says tells me about a firing squad. Tell me about some sensational story. Around the world, you know what the most common question is, tell me, what do you know about god? Africa, South America, India, the middle east, what do you know about god? And so, sometime I think that the focus on the stories, I think it's kind of kindergarten because the real message is the king of kings, the lord of lords, the lord god almighty who created a universe, who put people in it, who created US for a purpose, for a reason. And it's helping people find their purpose, finding the real meaning for their life. ♪ I will weep no more. ♪ For the cross that he bore. ♪ ♪ But I will glory. ♪ In the cross. ♪ Hallelujah! ♪ I will glory in the cross. ♪ ♪ I will glory in the cross. ♪ Hello, god bless you. Jesus loves you. You speak English? Si, yes. Yes, yes. And that's why we carry the cross around the world, to let people know that god loves US. Do you know that god loves you? To be able to have carried the cross and see the way that god has opened the way, the identity that people have felt with the symbol of the love of god. And just say dear Jesus, would you say--come into my heart, give me a new life, forgive my sins, I want to follow Jesus, I love you, lord. Thank you. It's all about loving him and loving other people because the way that one treats the poorest person, the most despicable person, the person with the worst attitude, the person who is the most violent, are deranged on earth, is the way that you treat Jesus. I know you've gone through some hard times, right? But he loves you. He loves you. See, of all the people to walk around the world, I'm probably the least likely. I never played sports in my life. I grew up on a farm. I never graduated from college because I couldn't pass the foreign language. If you were looking for somebody who wasn't qualified, see me there in the hospital bed with a brain aneurysm two weeks before I'm to start walking across america. I started out from here 40 years ago and carried the cross around the world and came back. And if my coming back was just for you, Michelle, it was worth the journey. To be chosen to carry the cross, it's indescribable. I'm not worthy, most of all. But my unworthiness does not disqualify me from the call of god. And many times, it's the weight of what I feel the cross is inside is heavier than the wood I bear because I feel the hurts, the pains, the fears, the bitterness, the loneliness, but the cross is good news. Many times along the road, when things are tough and sometime when my body's ached and sometime when my heart is broke, I've walked on another step just saying, lord, I'll be your donkey. I want to lift you up. People will see you and know you and love you and know that you care and follow you. Thank you for giving me this privilege. And that's what I think I really am, is I've been a donkey lifting up Jesus. [Faint sobbing] And if there is any glory, it is unto god, not me. I never really dreamed that I would ever really live to see the completion of this journey. I figured I'd be wiped out by a big Mac truck somewhere or blown up somewhere. And when I finished that last step in Zanzibar, I don't know, the realization that even just sitting here right now, talking about it, it's millions of miracles. It is, it is just the most humbling thing to be identified with Jesus. It's all for you, Jesus, I love you. Thanks for calling me. Thanks that you had mercy to let me live to complete the journey, and even live to tell the story. Your destiny, your stations, your angels around me, the blood of Jesus about, and you brought US through, and may you be glorified, just glorified. [Faint sobbing] I have deferred a few moments of my time to a brother who was not scheduled to speak to you this afternoon, but many of US have felt that god would have him come and just give a brief word of greeting unto you. He has walked all the way around the world with this cross that you see behind me. Would you welcome our brother, your brother and mine, Arthur blessitt. Praise the lord. [Crowd applauding] Let's do a great and mighty and glorious Jesus cheer that they'll hear all over Washington. Are you ready? Give me a j. E. S. U. S. What does that spell? Jesus!
