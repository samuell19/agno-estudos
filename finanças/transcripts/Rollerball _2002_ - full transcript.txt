Not a problem. Hey, Mike. You ready to go? You look hot in the outfit. You all charged? ls this thing tuned up? They're ready. Three photographers, $250 each. l thought it was $400 each. Kid, are you in or out? l'm in. Okay, here to the bridge, winner take all. lf the cops get you, you're on your own. Right here, man. Look out! Beautiful ! Kid, smile. Give me room, will you? Shit! You almost got me killed, asshole. You son of a bitch ! Grab hold ! Oh, shit! -Marcus Ridley, how the hell are you doing? -l'm good. How long have you been back, bro? Three weeks. Spent it with my kids. l miss them when l'm over there. l'll bet. Why don't you bring them back? Looks like you can afford it. Look at all these baubles. So what happening, man? What's going on? Still trying to kill yourself? Something like that. What happened to playing pro? l thought you got picked for the minors last fall. Yeah, well, that didn't quite work out. You know, Coach wanted me to play D . -What you do? Hit him? -l should've. Wasting your life. l just haven't gotten the break l need. You know, NHL tryouts are in three months. Jon, the break you need is right here. They'll cover your travel, give you a $5,000 bonus just for showing up and if you make the team, pow. Come on, Rid. That's a circus, not a sport. lt's a pretty sunset though. -lt's the mines. -What is? The dust from the mines. lt makes the sunset red. Look, come on. We both know cash is king. l last two more years, l have enough to retire, support my family for life. They love Americans over there, especially baby-faced, boy-next-door types like you. lt'll be just like high school. You run, l block. Besides, it's where even a dufus-assed white boy like you can get laid. -ls that right? -That's right. l appreciate the offer, but l should stick around, you know? This is my year to make pro. l tried. Good luck with that. My flight leaves at 9:00 p.m. tonight, in case you change your mind. -Thanks for saving my ass today. -Anytime. And another unit, yeah. They're out back. -You'd better walk. -What? What's the matter? lt's Sunday. The mines are out. Oh, shit. l don't understand a word you're saying to me, sweetheart. But maybe if you say it louder, l won't understand you even better! l get it. Your nipples get hard at the very sight of me, right? A new bio on the kid. Now he's a rodeo champion. Jonathan, Jonathan. Jonathan. . . . Lone Star, Texas. . . . . .The Lone Star state. . . Hailing from the wide-open plains of Texas, a former rodeo champion and the first-round draft pick by the prestigious National Hockey League back in the States. Considered the next Wayne Gretzky, he turned down a king's ransom from the NHL to play here -in a real man's league. -Holy shit. The Red Horsemen's sure bet for rookie of the year who kills his stubble each morning with a Wilkinson Sword Tri-flex. Here he is, your very own Jonathan Cross. Please, my friends. Sit down. Have a seat. You are his boy. Looks like Alexi's got himself some hot investors. -Vodka! -Vodka! There you go. Enjoy. You got your armadillo on? Jesus, you're an idiot. Serg ! ldiot. You wanna be a paraplegic? You have any idea what those guys out there can do to your spine? Got to catch me first, Rid. -Right. lt's your face. -Yes, Mother. -At least do it up. -Okay, Mom. Stubborn bastard. Toba! Okay, Toba. Big roar now. Let's hear it. Let's go. -Great roar, Toba! -You hang tight up there tonight, okay? -You, too, Jonathan. -All right. All right. Listen up, thugs. We got our butts kicked last game but the headhunter's not going down again. Are you? -l didn't hear an answer on that! Are you? -No! Let's give them something to think about in case we see them in the playoffs. That means teamwork, so no more cowboy, hot-dog, dog shit. Can't we all just get along, Dutch? No, Aurora's right. "No more cowboy, hot-dog, dog shit." When the Red Horsemen went to the Golden Horde last month they came back with their tails between their legs. Now the Horde comes to Horsemen town. The word is "rematch" and the Horsemen hope it's spelled "payback." A team must go around the track twice maintaining possession of the rollerball before they can score. lt's really that simple, as simple as using a Lifestyle female condom before sex. The ball must be held at all times. Player gear may be only used to dislodge the ball or prevent a score. A team gaining possession must first do the rabbit hole, that's that killer tunnel above each bench, then make one circuit through enemy territory and then they're eligible to score. All you really have to know is there's only one way to score and that's when a player takes one of the balls, wings it at one of the iron goals hard enough to set off the pyro. As for the rest of the rules, well, the rest of the rules are Russian and complicated, and we have. . . What's it gonna be, U-Chow? Us or them? Patience, outlander. The gods not yet ready. We got some big goons over there, people. Watch your backsides. Ten seconds, the first ball. First ball wagers close in 1 0 seconds. Five, four, three. -lt's us, it's us! -Go, go! Denekin, move! Balls away. lt's rollerball ! First play of the rollerball game is underway. He goes through the rabbit hole. This one's getting started early. Hotshot on the way. lt's a 1 2-foot jump. Yeah ! And Jonathan Cross is in enemy turf. He crosses back around. This game, l cannot believe it, is starting this early. Yes, yes, yes, yes! Cross leaps! Cross is in the air! He scores! Cross has scored in record time! Only 1 2 seconds after the first ball and he soars over the heads of the Horde! Cross has led a 1 -0 lead! Thanks. She say you must do again. -What? -Drink again. Label out. Put the label out. Yes! We are the hottest sports-entertainment start-up in the world, bar none. We have to pay a couple of the headliners, but the rest get bollocks. We can get them to fight for peanuts. Whoa, it's about to get interesting ! Yeah! Good move for Denekin! The local boy who made good used to work right here in the coal mine. All the glitz is put on in the media trailer out back. We even had a computer to build a city around it. Poof. And it becomes Vegas! We've got a fight down there. There is a fight going on right there. She just swung at a referee! That's a tutu in the penalty box! What was she thinking? We got a fox in the box, a fox in the box. They put that fox in the box. She's called in the catcher. He's a 400-pound monster on his way in. l will not allow this game to become corrupted like so many things in this part of the world. The integrity of the game must be maintained for the people, to keep their heroes alive. And to keep them gambling, of course. Go, go! Are you crazy? Are you insane? What are you doing mixing it up with that guy? He's doped up. Big deal. lt could be PCP , for all you know. That dude doesn't feel anything. Stay the hell away from him. Payback? How many of you will last through the season with management out there -watching this sissy perfermance? -That woman. -So go out there and score. -Come on. Let's stay focused. We have a lead. All we have to do is keep up the pressure. Tell cowboy to pass the ball once in a while. -They're keying on him. -She's right, Jonathan. Maybe if she'd get up in the air, somebody would pass her the ball. Enough ! We have a game to play. -On three. One, two, three! -Get some! -She's wide open! -Come on ! Throw it! He bogarts it! Cross keeps the ball! -Come on, Jon ! -l'm on it! Go! Move! -You don't listen, do you, cowboy? -Here you go, princess. Toba. Toba, get down ! Move! Somebody get a medic! You're okay. Come on. What are you doing? Get off of him ! Get out of here! Guys, wait! Hold on. Here you go. Toba, you're fine. Hang in there. And don't screw up. What? What the hell is wrong with the officials? l mean, the band can sure smell it. The audience can feel it coming. Cross is going over the top! And if the officials would quit playing games down there maybe we'll get this thing going. From the mountains to the prairies From sea to shining sea ...the championship. He asks if it's true your mother is a crack whore. You actually translated that? My mother's a paediatrician. The plane leaves at 8:00 a.m. That's 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Be there, be on it or be history. We will see you in the morning. My friends, they call me "Rabbit." Really? What was that? l think it's something about her only batting for the home team. Management told me you got to wear the hat from now on. -Yeah, like hell l do. -No, l'm serious. -Management's gonna tell us what to do? -You got me. You wear the hat. You wear the hat. -l told you this is the promised land. -Yes, you did. Last one to the club buys. -Jonathan ! -Hey, you get off! -Come on ! -l'll kick your ass, Rid. Shit. Goddamn. Yeah ! You guys are nuts! -l told you ! The promised land. -Yes, sir. Listen. Please take extra-special care of this car, okay? -Yes. -Thank you. -You ready for Ridley's Great Adventure? -Yeah. Let's go play ball. Gentlemen, gentlemen. -Rodeo. -That's great. l love this country. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Honeys at 4:00. Yes, ladies. -Sir Ridley's in the house. -American horses, right? Absolutely. And hung like one. We don't speak much. That's the way l dig it. You don't speak much. "The way l dig it"? Kid, you ever tried to get laid with an accounting degree? Hey, Jonathan ! -Katya, how are you? -Look. -My number. l got my number on. -She's official. She's got her number. Congratulations. lt looks beautiful. What's the matter, Rid? You don't like the idea of a number tattooed on your face? You guessed it. And now we will all get big bonuses, thanks to you Uncle Sammys. To Jonathan and to Ridley. Thank you very much. No, This toast should be to Toba. To Toba. Come here. To Toba. Why do you show me disrespect? You work 24 hours in the mines, and it pays you nothing. l brought you in here, and you try to pay. All right, my gypsy brother. Have a drink. A little wound tonight, Denny? What happened could have happened to any of us. lt's just. . . lt's very bad shit, man. lt's a rough game. That's why we get paid. You make a hundred times what l do. What's up, Denny? What if it wasn't an accident? What are you talking about? U-Chow. Show him. -The chin strap's been cut. -Where'd you get this? -l found it in the trainer's office. -Look at this. Slow down. She says the gambling syndicates probably put them up to it or something like that. Can you just shut up a little bit? We need to go tell Petrovich. No, we'll deal with this on the track ourselves. Toba was almost killed out there, Rid. He's the owner. l wouldn't bother him with it. Fine, Captain. l'll go. Enjoy the party. No move. Me be back soon. Tonight was the best game. Real cowboy shit, huh? ls he available? Of course, for you. Mickey, gentlemen, please. My stallion. Ridley, my homie. Let me introduce my friend. This is John Buckley from the U .S. Network. -Enzo Molinari, Canale Cinque. -Pleasure to meet you. And Yuri Kotlev, owner of the Horde. Be careful, Jonathan. l think he's very angry with you. Yuri ! Derek Cannon, an investor from Montana. One of those places, you know. How do you do, son? Nice to meet you. Big money. Big money. Could l talk to you for a minute? Yes, of course. Please, this way. What can l do for you? l think the chin strap's been cut. -Where did you get this? -lt doesn't matter. You're right. lt doesn't matter. lf that fat swine was behind this, l will get the owners to take his team. -May l keep this? -What are you gonna do? l'll take care of it. l swear on my mother's grave. Jonathan? He's the angriest man in the game. He just doesn't know it yet. Borges, you still back there? Discreetly. And how is Mr Jonathan tonight? You play good? How come it always feels like we got the freeways to ourselves? We are not a rich country, sir. Yeah. No shit. So why does everybody bet their ass on the rollerball? We call it the Atlantic City syndrome. Watch what you're saying. My apology, Jonathan. Our problem, not your problem. That's no worry, Borges. You guys be good tonight. -Jonathan. -Don't wait up. Jonathan. You think we could do this in a bed sometime? You know, with sheets and stuff? We've been through this. lt should be our secret. How could l forget? "lt could be used against us!" Against me. You're untouchable. Come on, Aurora. You don't need to hide all the time. l don't. Yes, you do. You live in the dark, for Christ's sake. -Your face isn't nearly as bad as you think. -l know that. Yeah. That's why you always turn your left side to people. l don't always turn. Toba's helmet was cut. l took it to Petrovich. And you think that does some good? He seemed pretty upset about it. l think he'll take it to the Horde owner. You are so naive. -They knew. -They knew what? One of the TV guys put me onto this. Let's see if l can call it up. Here. Look. That's Toba getting hit. lt's caught clearly on five cameras. So they were following the action. But let me back the feeds up five seconds. Now look. One camera follows the action and four cameras follow a simpleminded boy at the other end of the track. They were called and told to get on him 1 5 seconds before it happened. The Horde did not make that happen, Jonathan, not on their own. This TV guy. You know where to find him? -What's going on? -Demonstration. lt is the headquarters for the mines. Hang on. What do you want me to do? -Get out of the car! Get out. -What's going on? -Just trust me. Get out. Hurry. -Aurora, what's. . . Quick, Jonathan. Come over here. Hurry! Jonathan ! -Jonathan, get in here. Get in here. -What the hell's going on? Get in here. That's my goddamn car! That's not your car. lt belongs to Petrovich. He'll have another one for you by tomorrow. Come on. Goddamn. This is unbelievable. Jonathan, don't you know they can track you with these things? Come on. -What's with this place? -The state housing authority sold off the apartments, then they went out of business. -So what? -They never sold off the hallways. -There is no one to take care of them. -No shit. Sergei? Stop! Don't kill him. Let me guess. This isn't your friend Sergei, is it? No, Sergei's gone. Of course he is. l suppose we can't call the police about it either, right? Let's get out of here. He may be the police. You almost missed the flight. Good morning. lt's a beautiful day, huh? Yeah. And it was a long night, huh? lt was, yeah. l partied, the usual thing, with the team. We found your car. Are you all right? -Yeah, yeah. l just had a little accident. -l'm sorry to hear that. Serokin, did you follow me last night? l just found your car, that's all. Wouldn't want you to be without. So there was a goon in the apartment, and the guy booked out in a hurry. There might have been a thousand reasons why. He might've been lying to Aurora. Let's say they are screwing with the game. Then? Yeah? Then what? Then nothing. Status quo. We play, we win. And if it gets too sick, we walk. Come on, guys. l've got meetings. Why can't l just take a cab to the hotel? When the circus came to town, did they let the elephants take a cab to the hotel? You're the elephant. Get in the car, son. One, two, tres, cuatro. lt is an honour and a pleasure to be broadcasting to you this evening with a crowd pushing 50,000 in this beautiful desert city on the shores of the blue blue. . . Jeez, this outfit's got a lot of money. What is that? l'd say it's a good time in a can. Beep, beep. Come on ! Come on ! Come on in here and get your ass kicked ! Come on ! l love you. Tahli, what channel did you say you gave us in your territory? -1 09. -1 09. l see. 1 -frigging-09. They do origami on Channel 6 of your silly hairball network! You ungrateful cretin ! l will kill you myself! l will disappear your whole family! Tell your people, you wanna do business with us, we are on channels one through five. Got it? You got that? Goddamn mouse. Goal, yes, goal. The Red Horsemen are rolling right over. . . Stop! What? Are you from Omaha or something? lt was only a matter of time before one these creeps realised that their take would go up as soon as they got a little blood on the track. What? Do you think, they sit around struggling with the morality of it? -They're gonna kill somebody. -That's what l'm talking about. Come on. l make more in a season here than l would 1 0 years doing people's taxes. They're not gonna let anything happen to us. They need us. So just close your eyes and take the money, okay? Sergei, the TV guy? They found him at the border, his throat cut, his mouth sewn shut. What's up? You don't look so good. What's going on? Well, you see, you hit the pod ramp and jump, and then l cross under and go. And then you shot in the free throw, and then you did the 440. So l wasn't sure, but l think you scored the touchdown. Got it? Absolutely. l scored a touchdown and l win. Gotcha. Gotcha. We'll beat them ! -This Mongol Blue Team is on fire... -We'll beat them ! ...and insane! They're lathered up like a Siberian wolf pack ready to tear the Reds limb from limb. You're not wearing your spine protector, right? That's right. With over a quarter left to play, it's the Horsemen. . . l see. -You should make some arrangements. -Alexi, l'm on. . . l don't want problems! l want solutions. lt's in the works. We got ourselves a motorcycle race here! Whoa! Aurora just got hammered! That son of a bitch has got to be eight feet tall. Here's your bike, little lady. Hope l didn't bend it. -Do l wish you spoke English. -l speak it just fine, asshole! Bail out! Easy, fellas. Come on, get him out. We're out of here. Ridley, my man. -How are you? -l feel like Freddy Krueger. -How is he, Doctor? -l'm good, l'm good. -He should be resting. -l feel fine. l can play. -You sure about that? -l feel fine. -Are you up to it? -lt was, after all, just an accident. You don't know how glad l am to hear you say that. All right, that's it. Come on, let's go. Out. You promised me you'd stop this. Dear God, your tone. How have l denied you? l have made you a rich man, an international star. l created a sport that you could thrive in. l have given you total freedom to do as you please and even satellite TV and asked for one thing: your trust. So will both my studs be at practice tomorrow? -Yes, sir. -Excellent. Horsemen, number one. Watch them. lf they take a shit, l want to know what it smells like. Let's go. Wait. Don't move. Close the door. lt's cold as hell. Please, the door. Hey, the door! Come on. Come on, Denny. What about our passports? Katya tried. She couldn't get them. She's afraid. l think they have something on her. -We have to wing it, then. -Get the cash from my place? Your apartment was being watched all the time. The players put this together. Thanks, Den. -Thank them. -l don't know what to say. Here, look. The nearest border is Russia. You have two crossings here at the Russian border. Here and here. One is by the river. lf you leave now from here, you can make it there by morning. -l thought you two were coming with us. . . -He has family here. l have my mother. And if you don't want them to disappear or have an accident. . . You can never really leave. -Aurora, wait a minute. -No. -Are you gonna be okay. . . -You stop. Before you say something even more stupid. Get the light over there on the wall. There's no way l'm gonna die in this shithole of a country. No way. We left the rest of the team, Rid. How many times are you gonna have to get your head handed to you before you stop picking fights with people who are too big? This isn't some college coach you can just flick off. These are dangerous people, man. Look, Jon, she's safe. She's safe. Nobody knew about you two. Shit. We have company. Looks like they brought the whole Russian cavalry, Rid. Great. We're being chased by our own bodyguards. Here they come, Rid. They're on your bumper. The fender. Squeeze them ! -Come on ! -Oh, shit! Come on, you son of a bitch ! -That ain't gonna work twice. -They're still coming on us. -Remember Squeak Harris? -Of course, l remember Squeak Harris. Remember how he died? -Change with me. -Now, listen, Rid. . . Oh, shit! -Let's rock and roll ! -One, two, three! God ! Goddamn it, this road isn't even paved ! Listen, l haven't seen lights in about an hour. Why don't we back it off a little? How fast are we going, anyway? l don't know. lt's in klicks. How fast is it in klicks, then? 1 1 0, 1 20. That's not so bad. Ridley, that's in miles per hour! -So what? -"So what?" You're going 1 20 miles per hour on a Hog on a dirt road ! lt's not an off-road bike, Rid ! Ten klicks to the border. Chill. Yeah, that ten klicks is gonna be a long walk if one of these tyres goes out. Oh, shit. Ridley, we've got lights! Don't look! Watch the road ! -Looks like they're gaining on us. -What? Yeah, they're definitely gaining on us, Ridley, and fast! -What the hell could they be driving? -My limit's 1 50, man. Faster, Rid ! What in the world are they driving? Shit! Come on, baby! Who said this isn't an off-road bike? l've got news for you, Rid. They've got an off-road aeroplane. -There it is. -That's it? That's the border? Well, what do you want, a Stuckey's and a casino? Hang on. We can make it. lt won't work. Not double. Then you go. Don't get saintly on me, Ridley. -Look, l got you into this! You go! -Your kids! Go home! -Ridley, l'll be fine. l promise. -No! Get to the American consulate on the other side. They'll have me on a plane first thing in the morning. -Go! Get out of here! Go! -You better make it. Serokin. Close your eyes and take the money. God forgive me. Wait. Let's see if he makes it. Come on. Magnificent. Let's go. Make sure you tip the border guards well. Did you. . . Did you really think l could let you pull a stunt like that even if l wanted to, in front of them? How could you do that to me? How could you be so thoughtless? All right. We start again. l'll give you a bonus of $1 00 ,000 , payable however. You play through the championship. Play till the goddamn cable deal closes. Then you may go where you wish. l'll even give you a retirement game. Go fuck yourself. Throw that sack of shit out of here! Get rid of him ! Get rid of him ! Get rid of him ! Oh, Jonathan. What are we going to do with you, eh? ln the old regime, Petrovich was above the official rank in Spetsnaz before the age of 30 . KGB colonels used to cross the street when they saw him come. Now they all line up to grovel in the dust. Would you like a drink of water? No. You obviously don't care anything for yourself, but have you thought about the girl? Oh, dear boy, you don't imagine you have any secrets, do you? Why do you think she's still alive? Because Petrovich needs you and he'll give you just about anything you want including the life of that young lady, if you play your cards right. You have an opportunity here. You might call it the opportunity of a lifetime. You see Yevgeny over there, so full of himself now? He used to work in the post office. l introduced him to the proper financing and now he owns the mines. Yeah, making a fortune. He keeps the miners in line. Good business. Good business. You might wonder why l'm not in it myself. l don't need to own the mines. Do you know why? Because l own the man who owns the mines. All he has, l have. Same with the supermarkets, the TV station, locomotive plant. l don't need a political position because l own the men who do. We learn to separate ourselves from humanity, like you, Jonathan, separate yourself from your teammates. You can keep your $1 00 ,000 . But l do like the view from up here. No, l want more. l want ownership, part of the media rights, the gambling revenues, the works. Jonathan, are you fooling with me? Come on, Alexi, we both want the same thing here, don't we? Good. Very good. Let Serokin take you back home. You've got a big night ahead of you. What? Aurora's kind of bugging me. You know, getting way too serious. l hate that, too. Women. Yeah. l want her out of my life. Do me a favour and trade her. No problem. People disappear all the time. No, trade her, Alexi. Just trade her. l like the lady. l don't want her disappeared. l just want her gone, okay? All right. l'll do that. Play well tonight. Play well. Gave me a lot of shit about wanting to become a partner. Just cover to get the girl out. Did you give him that? l thought it was too subtle for him. So, the first chance he gets, he'll bolt. Shit! l'm this close to a North American cable deal ! Well, maybe there is one thing we can do to turn this to a profit. You did promise him a retirement game, after all. Sanjay, you are a rat. But you are my rat, and l love you. Go ahead. Trade the girl. Trade the girl to the Horde. But, we're playing them tonight. He wants her gone. Life is full of little disappointments. Make sure they get a number on her. We heard that you were in a rock-climbing accident. Are you all right? Yeah. You know me. l'm hard to hurt. Where's Ridley? You guys are always together. Yeah. Be careful. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what it's all about. One hard-fought struggle for all the marbles. And the Red Horsemen. . . There is unbelievable tension in this arena. There are four teams in the quartertinals, but without the help of Marcus Ridley who was crippled by a sudden attack of malaria which he contracted in the tropics on an archaeological dig. Malaria? lf they'll buy it, l'll sell it. -Ridley isn't sick, is he? -Don't get in this. Stay out of it. -You shouldn't go out there. -l've got to. That's how l got him to send Aurora away. He made it real clear. Where are they sending her? What do l care just as long as it's away from here? What makes you think you can trust him? l don't have a choice. You can't help me, Denny. lt's quite simple. The Golden Horde, however, seem to have several transfers from other teams. . . Hey, little lady, l see they got a number on you. Nice. Very nice. Yeah ! Yeah ! Get the goddamn camera out of my face, asswipe! And now, for all of you out there, a surprise is on the way. Despite earlier reports of a rock-climbing accident, he's coming back. Despite the pleading of his trainers and the threats of his doctors, he's coming back. He's coming back for the love of the game. He's coming back for you and for me. The greatest rollerballer who has ever lived, -your very own Jonathan. . . -Cross! Look. Bravo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's this? You understand that? They give this message to you. "Play well, and she will be on the Horde team playing tonight." Ladies and gentlemen, a special announcement. As you all know, at the last owners' meeting in Odessa certain rule changes were proposed and adopted. ln the final elimination round normal rules and penalties are to be suspended. What are they doing? The game will be played with no fouls called and no penalties. What is this shit? There's no such rules. . . No penalties. This is gonna be interesting. He tattooed her face. -What are you gonna do? -Play the goddamn game, l guess. You ever see thugs like that on the bench before? This will make us, my friend. This will make us. Do you have the pictures and the resumes on the replacements? Ladies and gentlemen, what we've got here is Jonathan and Uglich in a no-holds-barred cockfight. Say hello to Mr Denekin ! Cross snags it. No bogarting this time. He passed it to Katya, who scores! Boy, this crowd sure appreciates Denekin, the local boy who made good. As a matter of fact, there's a lot of friends in the audience including his entire shiff from the mine. Gold seem to have an extra player on the track. Have we got some kind of grudge match here? Aurora seems determined to wipe out Jonathan Cross all by herself. Get out of this! They're going to kill you ! Aurora, get off the track. Go on, girl. Holy shit, he's wearing a spine protector. He knew. He knew. Here's your grudge match! Uglich and company singling out Jonathan Cross and trying to put him in the ground. Shit! Cross turns it around! Takes out Robot! Look out! Uglich's dead meat! You see? The show is just getting started. That's about the hardest hit l've ever seen ! l got the Asian flu. Come on, baby! Yeah ! What the hell are they doing? Yeah ! This may be getting out of hand. -Maybe we should call the whole thing off. -No. The Red coach is trying to call a time-out, trying to get her players out of the game. Come in !
