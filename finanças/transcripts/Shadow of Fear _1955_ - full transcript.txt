SHADOW OF FEAR (BEFORE I WAKE) Subtitles by Seglora Miss Haddon. Mr. Barnes. Nice to see you again, Miss. You haven't changed a bit. At my age? Old fatters don't change, Miss, but you. You're real grown up now. How long is it? Three years? No, four. I graduated from the University of California this year. - Well, well, congratulations. - Thank you. Excuse me, Jack, taxi. Take Miss Haddon's bags. - Pleasure, Miss. - Hello Jack. I'm sorry it's sadness you come home to, Miss. Everybody in the village will miss your father, everybody. - I'll sit in front with you, Jack. - Right, Miss. - Thank you, Mr. Barnes. - Good Bye, Miss Haddon. - Village hasn't changed much,has it? - No, not much. You must have packed up and left America very sudden like. Yes, the day I got the news. Shocking business. Why I drove your dad in this very car only last Tuesday. Please Jack. And coming after your poor mother's death only last year, well really. - Jack if you don't mind I.. - I'm sorry, Miss. Mrs Haddon, your stepmother. She's taken it very brave as you'd expect, real wonderful she is. I've never met her. Oh,that's right I've forgotten how long you've been away. But you'll like Mrs Haddon, I'm sure. Everybody likes Mrs Haddon. There is St Mary's. And there is your house. Well, here you are, Miss, back home again. Here you are, Jack. Thanks very much. Want some help? No, thank you, Miss, I can manage, don't you worry. Jack, over here. April, my dear, I wondered so long to meet you. How do you do? I got your cable the day before yesterday and I came as quickly as I could. - Yes of course,you must be exhausted. - Yes I am. The place looks wonderful. - Good Day, Mrs Haddon. - Thank you, Jack. It hasn't changed a bit. I'm so happy to have you home, my dear. Yes, it's all rather different, isn't it? Yes, it certainly is. I had the whole house done over last year. Come and sit down, my dear. And I'll get you a nice cup of tea. Elsie. Don't you think it's much brighter, it was so gloomy before. But I loved it before. It was so warm and inviting. Why, the old furniture? Dust collectors my dear, thank you. Oh, Elsie this is Miss April. - Pleased to meet you, Miss. - Hello Elsie, you are new here. Where is Mr and Mrs Predous. They left a long time ago. Thank you. As a matter of fact we've goad up part of the house. Don't you think this modern is so much keener and healthier? Sugar, my dear? Didn't my father say anything? He was so surprised. What did you do with all these old dust collectors? I gave them as they were to people who needed them. - Oh, I see. - You see, April. I wanted to make an absolutely new home after I married,you don't blame me, do you? It isn't so hard to understand, is it? No, I suppose not. Just that. I feel like a complete stranger in my own house. Oh no April. Oh my dear don't, we got to be brave both of us. - I'm sorry. - Don't cry. I'm not crying. Please I'd like to go up to my room. Hello, cuddles. Well, my dear. Do you like to have a warm bath and change before dinner? No thank you. I think I'll stay and unpack some things. Please don't worry about me. I quite understand how you feel about these little toys. but they are dust collectors my dear. My very own daddy always promised me that my room would be left as it was. For me to come home to. Yes, of course. But it's not wise to live in the past, April. And I am your mother now. My stepmother you mean. Very cruel, April. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I guess I'm a little tired. Please dear I'd rather you didn't smoke if you don't mind. Why? I don't like it, my dear. But I enjoy smoking. What harm is there in it? No harm,April, it's just the smell of tobacco smoke makes me feel ill. Your dear father stopped smoking to please me. I can't imagine daddy without his pipe. He loved is so. He gave it up to please me. I bet he did. I didn't even have to ask him. He was so much better without it and without liquor too. What? Daddy without his wine cellar and Napoleon brandy? We won't discuss it anymore. But I must tell you I don't permit strong drink in my house. Yes. That is your house,isn't it? And it is also different. April. I loved your father very much. I've been so lonely these last few days. Ever since the awful... Shock of his death. And have it we shall. And we can talk and get to know each other. You're very quiet this evening, my dear. I was thinking about my father. I'd like to know exactly what happened to him. A little later, dear. How is the coffee not like America, I know? I'll get used to it again I guess. I don't think Elsie approves of me. Well,she is very simple girl, you know. I'd think she rather expected you to wear more suitable clothes for the occasion. I had no time to buy any new clothes. Yes, dear, I understand. You said that after dinner you'd tell me about my father and the accident. Very well. There isn't much to tell really. He went out fishing on the day of Monday evening in a rowing boat. And another boat,larger one I suppose, ram him down. His boat was cut in half. And they found the body next day. Poor father. And the boat that ram him down? They haven't found it yet. They? Why haven't they found. This murderer. It could have been an accident, April. But why haven't someone come forward? The other boat must have been damaged. The police has searched every harbour for miles around. Poor daddy. Yes, you may well say that. You know he was very unhappy about you April all this last year. - You never wrote. - I didn't write? He never wrote to me. He didn't tell me of my mother's illness. He didn't tell me she was dying, he didn't tell me anything. April,how can you say that? He did not, he didn't write. I wrote to him, to my mother I even wrote to the servants and no one answered. Until after my mother died. I got a letter from him then. Months later I got another letter telling me he'd married again. If you knew the truth about those terrible months and about your mother. If you didn't hear from him,April, it was to stay you from knowing. Knowing what? That your mother had become... Oh my dear, I'm sorry. Your mother had become a drunkard, a dipsomaniac. That what was caused her death. Are you crazy? How dare you say such a thing about my mother. April, I was her nurse, I'm only telling you what we tried to save from the... I don't care who you were. I don't believe it. - April please. - Let your hands off me. We tried to prevent anyone from knowing. No, you are lying, it's not true. April you are not being fair. I'm telling you the truth. I nursed your mother with all the strength and skills I had. I don't believe you. Breakfast is at 8 o'clock on account of the funeral it is at 10. Thank you Elsie. Shall I hang up your clothes for you, Miss? No,thank you I'll do it myself. Oh Mrs told me to have this evening. All right. I'd like another cup of coffee please, Elsie. Very good, Miss. Elsie. - Is that for Miss April? - Yes, Mum. Better way, I'll take it. I tried to hep her unpack, Mum, but she wouldn't let me. - Never mind. - And I know why she wouldn't. She's got strong liquor in that suitcase of hers. - What? - A whole bottle. I saw it. - Are you sure? - I'm certainly, Mum. Not surprising either after what you told me about her mother. Elsie, I think it would be kinder if we didn't mention this to anyone. Very well, Mum, I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to. Thank you, Elsie. I brought your coffee myself, I wanted to make sure you were all right. Very nice of you, thank you, Good Night. We don't want our first evening to end on an unfriendly note, do we? I had hoped when you come home, we would be friends. Your dear father hoped so too. You said some pretty horrible things tonight. Yes, the truth can be brutal. As a nurse I should have known to soften it for you, I blame myself. - Really not talk about it. - Very well. Have your coffee before it gets cold. - Good night - Good night Pleasant dreams. Elsie, where is. Of all things at her own father's funeral. And if you ask me that why she didn't come, it's her mother all over again. What a pity. How terrible for poor Mrs Haddon. Well, what do you expect,the apple never falls far from the tree. - Why only last night... - Elsie. Have you forgotten your promise? I think you'd better go home now. Yes, Mum. What a pity you had to come here by yourself, Mrs Haddon. Miss April should be ashamed. Poor child, I don't blame her. She has had a long and tiring journey. This has been a great emotional shock for her. But today of all days. Please, try and think well of April. If only for her father's sake. Elsie I want a straight answer, who tried to awaken me this morning? The Mrs. herself and she is very upset too. Don't you think I am. - My own father's funeral. - Yes, Miss. that's what exactly everybody was talking about, when I was there I heard them say. Elsie. That's quite enough. Is the vicar or anyone coming to lunch, Mrs Haddon? No, only Mr Driscoll the lawyer. I cancelled everyone else I thought Miss April would prefer it. It was a beautiful service,my dear, I'm sorry you couldn't be there. How could you let me oversleep like that this morning? Please. Don't you remember me trying to waken you? - No I don't. - That's hardly surprising. What do you mean? Stop pretending April. I told you last night I didn't approve of drinking in this house. Drinking? I took an empty brandy bottle from your bedside table this morning. Well, I... I just got that for the plane because I was sick, I only had a little bit. Are you crazy? You seem to think I am. I tell you... April how could you do this. You're making something out of nothing. Of all things, ridiculous. All I know it is that I couldn't waken you. When I saw that bottle by your bedside I knew why you slept so sound. Will you stop that I did not drink that brandy. I'm sure I didn't. It would be easy to lie to me if. I am not lying to you. I want to believe you but I went through a lot with your mother. and I don't want to do go through it again. Look stop talking about my mother. Then don't remind me. My dear, I don't want to quarrel with you like this. If I misjudged you I'm sorry. Don't resent me. Don't hate me, my darling. Someone we both loved has just died. We will stand together not apart. I can't believe it. I've never overslept like that before. What did people say, what did you tell them? That you were tired and grief stricken. and that they understood because they were all grief stricken. Just as I am and always will be. I'm sorry. The balance of my entire estate is to be held in trust for my daughter April. until she should reach the age of 21 years. Provided if I die before she reaches that age of 21 years. she should return to England immediately. and reside with my wife until she obtains her majority. But, Mr Driscoll, surely this isn't my husband's last will, when did he make it? At the time of your marriage. But he made another a few months ago. I prepared it but he kept wanting so many changes he never signed it. I see. Now April is there anything you don't understand? I'm not quite sure what it all means. It means Florence gets this house, its contents and a 1000 £ a year. You get all the rest. although Florence has control over it until your 21st birthday. that's very soon, isn't it? Yes about three weeks. Until then you are the ward of your stepmother. You must remain under her roof in her care. And if I don't wish to remain here? April. Florence is your legal guardian, you must stay with her. If you don't live with her till you're 21 you lose your share of the estate. Mr Driscoll what if something should happen... to me in the next three weeks before I'm 21? My dear child I have never seen anyone look healthier. But if I should die? Then the entire estate will go to Mrs Haddon. Dear for goodness sake, Mr Driscioll is there anything else? - No, that's all. - Excuse me. It's been a tragic year for you, Florence. well it's better for everyone that April is back. - I'm sure you're right. - How is she taking it? Oh not too badly it's a little difficult for her. She is nervous not too strong a little like her mother. Like her mother? More ways than one. Is just she is unbalanced perhaps now she is at home she settle down and get over it. I did admit I heard some gossip her not being at the funeral they said that. I never listen to gossip. No, no neither do I. Good day, Mrs Haddon. Mr Driscoll. Yes, my dear. - Were you at the inquest? - Yes, of course. Did anyone question the fact... that my father was fishing in the bay that night? Why should they? I've never known my father to fish from a rowing boat. The habit may have changed,you've been away for four years. What was the evidence of the inquest? Purely circumstantial of course. The remains of the wrecked boat and your father's fishing tackle. April. Mr Driscoll,did you ever see my mother when she was ill? It wasn't possible to see her she was confined to her room. I believe she was a little difficult. You mean Florence told you that my mother was an alcoholic. I'm afraid that's the case. Then who else said so? Your father knew, of course. My father is dead. There were servants here. The servants have all been sent away. April you must get to grip on yourself, you obviously need a rest. Florence is the very person to look after you. Is there anybody else who could tell me what happened? There's old Dr Elder of course, he had charge of the case. Why don't you drop in and see him. Dr Elder, yes I think I will. Please,Miss Haddon, I'm sorry doctor, but she butt right in. It's all right, Minnie. Hello, what can I do for you, young lady? I want to see Dr Elder. - I am Dr Elder. - That's not possible. Michael? I can't believe it. Good to see you. It's been a long time, April. You're a real doctor. And I got a diploma to prove it. Oh, I'm proud of you. Come here and sit down, April. - Do you like a cigarette? - No,Florence doesn't... Yes, I think I will, thank you. Tell me what you've been doing after all these years. Michael I like to sit and talk to you but I really came to see your uncle. My uncle is retired and I've taken over his practice,can't I help you? - No I don't think so. - Please. You see your uncle knew my parents. And I want to talk to him about something very important. Now what is this all about? Well,there is quite a few things I don't understand... about my mother's illness or her death. I have only Florence's words about these things frankly I think she is lying. You're letting this whole thing upset you far too much. And I think as an old friend you are talking lot of nonsense. Florence is a very fine person. - You think so. - Yes. - What bare you doing? - Taking your pulse. I don't, I think she is cunning, conniving fraud. No relax you're working yourself up over nothing. She told me my mother was a drunkard. That's what's upset you? Do you believe it? There is nothing else to believe. Has my stepmother changed everybody's thinking in this town,even you? It's not a case of that, it's. She even innovated that I was too drunk to go to my father's funeral. You are mistaken there, because happen to know Florence stop people discussing. I don't... You've got it all wrong. Florence is a very wonderful person. And everyone in this town thinks exactly the same way as I do. Michael will you listen? You should seen the look of my stepmother's face, when she found out that my father hadn't signed the new will. As it now stands the bulk of the estate goes to me. providing I live with her until I'm 21. Do you know what you are implying? Yes, I do. Florence is going to try to kill me before my birthday. So she can inherit the entire estate. So I haven't got very much time. Calm down young lady. Never let anyone in this district hear you talk like that about Florence Haddon. - Understand? - Michael. When I saw you I thought that maybe I found somebody that might be willing to help me. No April, please. - My father was murdered. - It was an accident. - Here is the papers. - I don't care what's in the papers. Go on read it. Can I help you Miss? Yes I'm looking for a powered launch with a damaged bow. The police sergeant was looking for the same thing. Oh, thank you. - Michael. - What are you doing? I'm just proving a diagnosis of mine. Look at yourself. You're a bundle of nerves. You don't have to scare your patients half to death to prove your point. You didn't scream when I hold you in the old days. That was a long time ago. What are you doing here? I'm going out to the lighthouse, got a patient of mine out there. I'm waiting for the boat to pick me up. What's that? Memories here? They were happy days. Yes. Sorry I was a bit rough with you yesterday. That's all right I guess I deserved it. Maybe you think it was feminine intuition on my part but I know Florence. - You're developing a complex. - All right, all right. I won't say another word about it to you until I can prove something. - Doctor. - There he is. - Well I got to go. - So soon? I'd much rather stay. Dr. Elder. Here Jack. - Ready, doc.? - I will be with you in a minute. By teh way, if you ever feel like taking the old "Happy Daze" out to sea. don't forget to sign me on,eh? Seaman, navigator, cook. Or if you are lonesome, companion. Thanks, Mike. Hey, hold that. Hold what? - Oh, the smile silly. - Ah! You keep it right there, eh. - Thank you, Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello. Mike. Mike. Mike come. The meal is getting spoiled, Mum. I've no idea where Miss April can be. You're surely not going to wait any longer. Very well, I see that maybe it is you better serve. Quite right, Mum, no reason why yours should be spoiled. Thanks, Doc., pick you up tomorrow night. I'll be ready, Jack. You are still here. Listen, while asking you that today I saw something that proves I was right. April not again. Let me show you. The boat that rammed my father down. would carry the mark of it's crash on it's bow wouldn't it? Of course. The speed he must have been travelling. There, look at the dent on the bow no paint scrapings. And don't try and tell me I'm crazy Don't get so excited, the dent could have been caused by anything. Michael, it's new,look at those paint scrapings they just happened recently. You take it easy this boat has not been of a mooring for ages. Michael. I tell you this is the boat that rammed my father down and killed him. That stupid Sergeant hasn't even checked it yet. Don't you see Michael it all fits, Florence did it I know she did it. Stop it, April. Florence adored your father, understand that. Mind, she never goes near a boat. She couldn't take out launch like this and bring it back single handed. Don't you understand? I think that. Michael don't say anything. April,my dear, I've been waiting for you. I was beginning to worry. Is anything wrong? No, nothing. Yes, I forgotten you two are friends. Yes we are very old friends. April you've had no lunch. I wasn't hungry. Elsie kept a hot meal waiting for you. run up for house and have it, I don't want anything to happen to you. I think you should do as Florence says, April. All right. Poor child, she's been through rather a lot lately. I hope nothing seriously wrong with her, doctor? No I don't think it is anything serious. I've done all I can to help her but she makes things rather difficult for me. She is full of all sorts of complexes. But you probably found that out that for yourself. Yes,she does seem to be imaging things. - Good Bye,Doctor. - Good Bye, Mrs Haddon. You've been away from me all day. And you acted so strangely tonight. Don't be like this, April. I am so alone now. Can't you trust me, try and be a little friendly. What were you doing out there my dear? Nothing just looking at the boat. Remembering all the fun we used to have. Yes,your father used to love it too. But one thing I could never share with him. Why? I've always been afraid of boats. I suppose because I'm a bad sailor. Try and get some rest my dear. Good night. Good night. Pleasant dreams. Who is there? - Who are you? - Eh. - I said who are you? - Oh Henry Collins Miss. - Hello. - You'd be Miss Haddon. - That's right. - I heard you were back. What are you doing here? What I'm told giving the old boat a spit and polish, regular once a month job. When was the last time you worked on the boat? Seven or eight days ago. Why are you working on it now? Mrs Haddon told me to give it a special clean up. Mrs Haddon. Maybe she thought that you liked to use it. Tell me something. Has anybody taken this boat out since you last worked on it? No,no couldn't be done wasn't no one to take it out. Even your father didn't use it for months. - Do you always check it very carefully? - Eh. I said,do you always check it examine the boat very carefully? Of course I do I check it from from stem to stern. Then will you come with me please. Perhaps you can tell me something about this. - What about that? - Well, blimey. Was that then there the last time you checked this boat? It certainly was not. Would you swear to it? I always do my job properly that will need straighten it out and a spot of paint. Would you swear that dent was new. and couldn't have been made whilst the boat was tied up here? Of course it's new if it had been there when I was here before I'd seen it. Now look don't tell anybody about this until you hear from me. Don't you worry, miss. And you swear that was made in the last few days? - I'll make it worth your while. - Eh? Never mind will you swear to it. I always tell the truth I do and I do my job. Good,that's all I wanted to know. It was my stepmother that told you that Happy Daze hadn't been out in weeks. That's right,Mrs Haddon herself. Sergeant I think if you come with me I can prove she's been lying. Look Miss April we are checking on an accident in a routine. It was not an accident,Sergeant, it was murder. Murder? What are you saying? I found the boat that killed my father. And I'm sure it was my stepmother that rammed him down. If you are insinuating that Mrs. Haddon could possibly... Who else is to benefit from my father's death but my stepmother. And I got all the evidence you need to prove it. Now look here,Miss April,I've known you since you were a little girl. I don't think you know what you are talking about. Sergeant Wick haven't you been looking for a boat. with a newly made dent in its bow? Well? The Happy Daze happens to have one, so I suggest you go and look at it. All right I'll do just that and you're coming along with me There, there is your evidence. I don't see anything. Henry why did you repair this? Why? Another little job on it. Well, I as..., has my step mother been down here? No. Then why did you do this? I'm paid to keep this boat ship shape and that's what I have done. Ask him about the dent in the bow? Go on and ask him. Well, Henry? All right then, there was a bit of a dent. There you see. But that could have been done anytime. when the boat's rubbing up against the landing stage. For this boat in place, that's impossible. You said before that was new,couldn't have been when this boat tied up here. - That's right? - Eh. Is that right was Miss Haddon said? Look here nobody is going to get me into more trouble. You said that you'd swear that was done in the last... Come right, Miss,you said you'd pay me money if I'd swear to it. Did you try to bribe this man? No,I did not try to bribe this man. He's twisted everything I'd said. I'm paid to do my job. Do you realize how serious this is? Yes I do realize how serious this is. Then I also realize that my stepmother make a complete fool of all of you. Poor,Mrs Haddon,she is going to have a lot of trouble with that young woman. Drinks like a fish they tell me, just like her mother. Can I see you a moment, please, Mrs Haddon? Sergeant Wicks how is your wife? Oh,much better we are extremely grateful. You've,you don't mind if I go on with this,do you? It's a first aid equipment that I promised for the children's playground. That's very kind of you. Yes? It's about Miss April, Mrs Haddon. Go on. She came in to see me yesterday. All excited and she made some slanderous. Well she made some very unpleasant insinuations. She said that the boat we were looking for was the "Happy Daze". Poor child, she is full of wild fancies, you see, Sergeant. a person who has been used intoxicants and is then deprived of them. Well, medically,what do you want to say? Yes, but she mustn't go around talking like this. you have to take her in hand, Mrs Haddon, and control her. I'm trying to but with love and care. Please,Sergeant,could ask you for her sake not to mention this to anyone? Very well,Madam,but you are being more generous than wise. Kindness is the best teacher. Is it, Mrs Haddon? I warn you, Miss April, I've known your family for a long time. but any more talk like yesterday and you'll be in serious trouble. - Good Day, Mrs Haddon. - Good Day, Sergeant. Don't you think you owe me an apology? I can forgive for what you've done because I know the strain you are under. I am sorry, Florence, very sorry that I told them what I did. I promise you it won't happen again. That makes me very happy. Now I said that I'd help to redecorate the Church Hall. I should need an (?) would you like to come and cut them? - I'd love to. - Come along then. they are lovely at this time of the year, the colours are so beautiful. About you Florence you are always doing such nice things for other people. I'm glad to be able to. Is that one of the reasons for you why you became a nurse? Perhaps it was. Did you like it? Sometimes. Sometimes I hated it. It was very hard work for very little compensation, you know. How long did you take care of my mother? Three months night and day. Did Mrs Predous help you? She was very fond of my mother. My dear, she was worse than useless. Besides they were dishonest they had to be dismissed. Oh, I can't believe that. What happened to the Predous? Oh, Elsie. - Yes, Mum. - You've forgotten what day it is? - It's Wednesday, Mum. - It's your mother's birthday. So it is. I'd promise you a day off, remember. Thank you very much, Mrs Haddon, that's very kind of you. Stay overnight, I know she loves to have you. Sure you can manage without me? Oh,yes we can manage by ourselves, it's only for one night. Run along, Elsie, or you'll miss your bus. Bless you, Mum. Florence,you were going to tell me? What did happen to the Predous? - I believe they went to Mrs Harrison's. - The Harrison. Oh, yes they were very good friend of ours. They didn't stay there long, she had trouble with them too. Excuse me. Aren't you going to stay to help me finish the flowers? No, I've got some other things I really should do. April,if you are thinking of visiting the Harrisons. I shouldn't bother, they've not been very friendly. Thank you, Florence. Madam, Miss April Haddon. April. Darling child. - How lovely - Hello, Mrs Harrison. Let me look at you,how you've changed,come and sit down and tell me all about yourself. I really came to get some information. I thought you maybe could help me. Of course, darling. Penny for your thoughts, Florence. I was thinking about April. Poor child,she had such a bad time. But it's her birthday in a few days. I was wondering if I couldn't get a few of her old friends. - Let's make a party - That would cheer her up, wouldn't it? That what I want to do. All her old friends are in town. Hermman and Jordan. That was an awful thing to come home to I wish I'd never gone away. My dear,even if you've been home, I doubt if you could have done anything. Florence had complete control. What about my father,didn't he have anything to say? He was always so frightened, helpless about illness. and Florence had the doctor under her thumb, poor Dr. Elder he is so old and vague. Couldn't you do anything,you were my mother's best friend. I wasn't allowed to see her, no one was. She was virtually a prisoner. Even your father was only allowed in at certain times. And then Florence was always there. What about the servants, Mr and Mrs Perdous, didn't they fight her, they adored my mother. They implored your father to get in another doctor and a different nurse. But he wouldn't listen. Florence said the Perdous were dishonest. I couldn't believe that I had them here for a while. but with all this gossip going on about them they wouldn't stay. She'd see to that,I guess they knew too much. They said some very unpleasant things about her. Really, what did they say? I remember they were saying something in her desk. There was something very strange going on. Yes, there was. Florence didn't nurse my mother, she killed her. My dear, I don't like Florence any more than you do. but I couldn't believe that she deliberately caused your mother's death. It should be too awful to think about. Nothing is too awful for that woman. - Darling I'm sure you're wrong you must. - No,no I am not. I'm going to prove it. Florence. Florence. I hope you found something interesting among my things. Give me those pictures. You do not know anything about boats. You get sea sick at the very sight of them. - Give me those pictures, April. - No, I won't. I need these pictures to prove you've been lying. What do they prove? That I once posed for a snapshot on a boat. I hated the sea then and I hated now. You want to make a fool of yourself again? If the police had seen these and the dent in the boat... that you had Henry Cowan to hammer out. I hope they hang you. Do you hate me so much that you come here like a thief and pry into my things. and then trying to justify your actions by accusing me something so horrible I... You can't even say it,can you Florence? It was murder. Get out of here you little thief! Did you take anything else from my room? No. Things aren't all what they seem, April. If you'd only asked me instead of spying on me. you might saved yourself from your own hysterical imagination... and learn the truth. Now. What did you take from my room? Nothing. It certainly seem strange that these letters were never posted. Yes,and why weren't they mailed. I don't know. But doesn't prove anything does it? What about the photographs I found. That's her words against yours. You say you saw then,she could say they never existed. But I know they did exist. Which proves that story about Florence being afraid of the sea is a a pack of lies. When we know she can handle a boat like the Happy Daze. If I was a lawyer instead of a doctor. I'd say that none of this evidence is admissible. No proof of anything, is it? No, I guess not. That's why I want to see your uncle. He was the only person besides Florence... that was allowed into my mother's sick room and know what went on. In that case let's go and see him. Maybe it'll put your mind at ease. Your mother didn't respond to treatment at all, that was because... Go on, tell her the truth. She was an alcoholic. I can't believe that,doctor, I just can't believe it. I know just how you feel,my child, it was a great shock to all of us. But no matter how we watched her... She always got hold of the liquor somehow. We took it away next day they'd be more there. She'd be half stupefied. It was the servants of course, your father had to dismiss them. When you saw my mother. It wasn't pleasant, April. She was almost out of her mind. I had to keep her quiet with sedatives. Administered by Florence, of course. Naturally. And the fits with hysteria got worse. The supply of alcohol had ceased, you see. That proves the Prudous were guilty I suppose. Doctor, I wonder why did my mother drink. Who knows? And later she begun to have delusions of persecutions. Fighting to get out of the room even in her weak state. Then Florence found her on the floor unconscious by the open window. Pneumonia had set in, she died without regaining consciousness. All right I'd rather had kept it from you child. but you wanted the truth I'll see you out. No, you stay there take it easy. You know this boat is the only place I really feel at home in these days. Yes, I've noticed that. Michael did you ever really wondered if Florence's story was the whole truth. You heard what my uncle said. Yes, I know but no one was allowed in the room. The only facts have come from Florence. Look at if she wanted my mother to die? - Why should she? - Well, she married my father, didn't she? You know, if you want to prove something... you can often make the facts of the case. Now she knows that I am on to it she's got to get rid of me. If I die she is not only safe but rich. You listen to me. Stop this stupid step mother complex. Why don't you, why don't you try and go away somewhere for a while? No, I'm staying right here. Florence is setting some kind of a trap for me, and I'm going to be waiting for it. You got to think of something else. How can I think of other things other than my father... So, now what are you thinking about. Oh, Michael. - I'm only at the top. - I know. You should be asleep. You'll strain your eyes typing in this light. We can't go on like this,you know in this state of armed neutrality. I've done everything I can to bring you closer to me. I even planned a little something for your birthday. Very well if you don't wish to talk to me. Good Night. Pleasant dreams. Florence.I've been thinking it over and I'm sorry about the other night. Prying into your desk. I'm very glad to hear you say so. Let's forget that it ever happened, shall we? That's very nice of you, thank you Florence. What did you do with yourself all day yesterday? Well I went for a drive with Michael Elder. I used to work with his uncle you know. Really? He was in charge of your mother's case. Why don't you go and talk to him? Yes, I might do that, one day. I have to drive to the other side of the bay this morning. I'm taking that first aid box to the children's playground. I'd like you to come with me. - Well. - We have so much to talk about. Perhaps I can explain everything you want to know. I think you find, my dear, you've been misjudging me. Well. All right. I'll get ready. It was very foolish of you to bother old Dr Elder yesterday, April. He told you? You're after me,he told me everything you said. And you lying to me. He thinks you're mentally unbalanced, and I'm beginning to think so too. Is that going to be your defence, Florence, that I'm crazy. Better you come to me and ask questions instead of going to other people. All right, tell me why you had those letters hidden in your desk? When your letters arrived your mother was too sick, she couldn't read them. And your father wouldn't send her letters to you because... as I told you,he didn't want you to know anything about her illness. Your answers are almost believable, Florence. Keep up, you just don't want to believe me, and very well then don't, I don't care anymore. Why are you turning off here? - In the Crypt road. - But why? Shortcut it saves time. What are you doing? Looking the door, in case it flies open. Don't lean against it. Florence,look out The brakes they won't work. Jump. April. April, are you all right? Yes I'm all right. But the brakes worked fine, Florence. Thank heaven you, you nearly. Get in I'll drive from here. Don't you understand, darling, when you are in this state of mind. every thing that happens is a threat,every word, every look has a hidden meaning. You don't believe anything I told you, do you? I want you to believe in me, darling, and as a doctor I know. I know she tried to kill me this afternoon, and she is going to try it again. If you go on like that you're going to have a nervous break down. That's ridiculous. I'm just plain scared. And I need help Michel, I need help badly. I want to help you darling, you know that, don't you? Michael, oh it's so frightening. Doctor, where are you? Doc., where are you? - There you are, doctor. - You are early, Simon. I know but Arthur is very sick, we'd better shove off now. Go on. All right, leaving you like this, darling. Bye Mike. I see you right early in the morning,eh? How long it be? Yes. I heard you come in so I brought you something. I'm not hungry. I waited a long time for dinner for you. Of course I can't compel you to dine with me or even sit with me if you don't want to. Let's drink our milk while it's warm,shall we? All right. Where have you been all day? - Walking. - By your self? Yes, by myself. Not good to be alone, April. Gives you too much time to think. You are very clever Florence. You can bent everybody in this town, you're an angel of mercy. Everybody but... But me. You killed my father. I know how you did it. Now you're trying to kill me. Do you feel all right,April? I know what kind of woman you are. Hello, Dr Elder, this is Florence Hadddon. I'm terribly sorry to trouble you, it's poor April, could you possibly come at once. Thank you. This way, doctor, please hurry. Good Heavens, what a shocking thing. I sent for you, doctor, because you knew all about her mother's case. - Yes, yes of course. - Can you help her? There take this. Open the window, will you, let's have some fresh air in here. Tried to cope with this violently drunken fits for temper before. Florence. Help me here. Child she is the victim of her own hysterical imaginations. Yes, I know, I know. I never realized that she was so ill. April. April. Doctor Elder. Oh, Doctor, help me. Please help me. Yes, yes child that's why I'm here. What's happening? Why so? - Brandy. - Yes I know, I know. Florence, she put it there, I didn't. You, you did this? Like you did to my mother. I can prove it. There is no brandy there, April. My letters, where are my letters? Where... She has... She is getting violent again, doctor. Better release the hysteria I warn you, better do something quickly. Never mind, never mind. She is a murderer. What are you doing? - What she's got to do. - Mind now. She is trying to kill me. - No, no please. - As she killed my mother. Please don't let her go near me. No, no, don't let her touch me. - She's going to kill me. - No. She killed my mother. She is going to kill me. - Florence. - Go away! Don't hurt me, please, get out. No please. Oh. Oh. Poor child perhaps you sleep now. I was up with her all last night. She won't stir up now after what I have given her. And you can get your rest tonight. I look round in the morning. Thank you doctor for helping me. If I should die. I'll find my own way out. Before I wake. I just can't believe this. she wasn't in her bedroom,I searched the garden and I found the boat was missing. There is some hope,isn't it? We found the boat on the rock reef what was left of it. And April? They are still searching. If only I'd sat up with her all night, but I couldn't. No, nobody blames you, Florence. I should have given her a much stronger sedative. I tried so hard to help her. Inspector,I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to make a statement, Mum. Of course, hello Mr Driscoll. Inspector as this letter concerns Mrs Haddon. I prefer to hand it to you in her presence. To be handed to April Haddon after her 21 St birthday. or to be handed to police in the event of her death before that day. Child she was always so sure that something would happen to her, some accident or something,she was almost hysterical about it. That doesn't read like a hysterical letter, Mrs Haddon. The girl's mind was affected by the shock of her fathers death. She's been drinking and making wild accusations. I don't know what she has written in this letter, but if it is about me, it's bound to be unpleasant. It'll be read at the inquest. - Is that really necessary? - I'm afraid so. And it won't do any good. I quite agree with Mrs Haddon. But I don't. I like to make a statement, Inspector, about Miss April Haddon. Let's make this official you better come down to the station. If you don't mind I rather say what I have to say right here. Last night I went out to see a patient of mine at the lighthouse. - And after 2 am Jack Storey was with me. - Yes. As we approached the river I saw the Happy Daze moving quietly without light. How do you know it was Happy Daze? She was caught in the beam of search light and I saw who was at the wheel. - April Haddon I suppose. - No it was Mrs Florence Haddon. I think you are mistaken,doctor. I wasn't mistaken. a few minutes later the launch goes past us out of control at full speed. April was propped up against the steering wheel. unconscious where Mrs. Haddon had left he. This is ridiculous he is lying. Storey and I followed that launch and saw it crash on rock reef. You don't believe this,do you? He was in love with April. He has no evidence, no proof of any kind. We managed to save a little of that evidence, Inspector. You don't believe it, he is lying, I tell you. - April. - It didn't work, did it, Florence? Now. - Normal? - Normal. That's wonderful. Now you are going to have a good long rest with a good tall doctor. Anyone I know? There is a fellow I can recommend to you... I don't her you saying it, is not coming through. Listen. I love you.
