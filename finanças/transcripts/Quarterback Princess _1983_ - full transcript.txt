Come on, get in there! Coach? Come on, grizzlies, let's pick it up! Come on, let's see some sweat. Let's go. Coach ainsworth, my name is ralph maida. J.r., you gotta come back. It's not 2 steps. I'm moving my family down from prince george, canada. I'd like to find out about tryouts for your team. Well, that's great. We can always use new blood. George, keep an eye on things, will you? We'll be right back. All right. Come on, this way. Come on, guys. All right. Let's work some passes. now? Now, let's go. So what brings you to minnville? I'm finishing my doctorate in psychology at oregon state. We're only here for the school term. Ok, here you go. Uh, we practice monday through friday, noon to 3:00 till school starts. I can work in a tryout anytime. Good. I'll have her bring these back. Monday ok? Sure. I'll need a doctor's certificate, too, but there's no rush. We won't start scrimmaging before, uh... You just said, "her." Yeah. It's my daughter tami. Your daughter tami wants to be a football player? Mm-hmm. Well, golly, uh, I sure would like to have tami on my team, but the school board would never go for it. It's my tough luck. Are you saying we have to go to the school board first? Tell me something. Why in hell would you want to push your daughter into a man's sport like football? Don't you have any sons at home? No, and if I did, I wouldn't push them into playing football either. But if that's what they wanted to do, i'd try to give them the opportunity to do it. It's what tami wants. So when is this school board meeting? It's, uh, a week from friday. Good. We'll be there. Any other questions? Just one. What position does tami play? Quarterback. That's perfect. Child: daddy! Tami, daddy's here! hi! Welcome home. Thanks! Daddy! Hey, dad! Hey. Hmm. Ha ha. Hi. Hi. Hi, dad. Me, too there. Hi, sweetheart. mmm! Ok, ok, ok, ok. Tell me what happened. Well, first, the school board has to vote on whether you even get a chance to try out. If they approve, then you get to bump heads with the rest of the team and show them what you can do. But...i don't think the coach is going to be on your side. Still wanna go through with it? Yeah. Ok. We're with you all the way! Yeah! Let's gather them up and move them out! No, no. Hey, dad, a bowling alley! It's like a regular city. Is there a movie? I don't know. That's what I'd like. I'd like to go to the movies. Pizza! All right! Grizzly country. Boy: hut! Look at all those football players. They look big. Are you scared? no. Dad, can you stop? I gotta go. Me, too. Wait, me first. Can I go first? Girl: lorenzo's gone! Man: lose one? No, lorenzo's a hamster. Don't worry, honey. He's bound to be in there somewhere. gas? Yeah, sure, fill it up, please. Hey, are you the moose hunter from canada with the girl quarterback? Oh, yes, how did you know? Are you kidding? It's all over-- Radio, television. Ha ha ha. About how this girl wants to play for the grizzlies. Damn silliest thing I ever heard. Uh, was one of those her? Yeah. Yeah? I thought she'd be a real big one. I mean, well--none of those girls look-- Well, you know, tough. A couple of them will fool you. It's so big! Look at that house! It's a hotel. I think it is. Come on, schatz. It's huge! Come on. Huge! I can't wait to get in. It's gonna be so neat and look at this. Look at all that stuff in there! There's no key. Is the back door open? no. I'm going to go back to that dairy queen on the corner and call Mr. Hobart. It is so big. What's wrong? Hobart has gone away for a few days. His wife doesn't know anything about the house. What? And she wasn't very friendly. What are we going to do? Go to a motel? Not on our budget. Why don't we just camp out in the yard until he gets back? No, ralph. We cannot camp out in the middle of the town. Why not? It'll be just like backpacking on fox creek without the creek. Come on. Let's get the tent, huh? Right. What do you think you're doing? You can't just pitch a tent in somebody else's yard. Actually, we rented it, but the landlord forgot to-- Oh, you're the canadians with the girl footballer. Well, where is she? Hello. Mr. Klosterman and I were talking. It isn't natural. And neither are tents and lord knows what else. Cornelia, come. Thanks, honey. Ralph, that was the strangest woman. Really? You ought to meet Mr. Penzer. There he is now. Hi, Mr. Penzer! Mr. Penzer knows all about tami. So did she. And I'm bewildered. Same. Bud... I found lorenzo. oh! That's my sneaker! Lorenzo ate my sneaker. Don't worry, jody, we'll get you another pair. Those were my best sneakers. They were your only sneakers. Don't exaggerate. Dad, do you think it's so terrible that I want to play football? No, of course not. If that's what you want and you can do it, why not? And we're right behind you. All: right! Quiet! Quiet, please! We can't conduct business with everyone talking at once. Mr. Caine, I believe you wish to say something in opposition to the matter before the court. You're damn right I do. I oppose any girl playing football. It is an insult to the game. And besides that, this is grizzly country. We have a tradition here, don't we? You betcha! Why don't we let her be a cheerleader? There you go! Give her a doll to play with! You all know my boy b.j., right? Yeah. He is going to have a great senior year this year at center. Now what the hell chance is he going to have for a scholarship if he is snapping the ball to some girl reaching down there between his legs? Mrs. Upchurch? There has been a suggestion from the floor to make miss maida a cheerleader. Now, tami, my daughter tiffany is a cheerleader. I just know she'd be happy to help bend the rules a little in your case. Wouldn't you like that, tami? No, ma'am, I wouldn't. ah! I don't want to cheer. I want to play. Oh, come on. Ridiculous. I'm sorry that upsets everybody. But this is probably the only chance I'm going to have to at least try. I don't know, maybe I'm not good enough to make the team, but I sure would like to have a shot at it. The bottom line is the oregon state athletic association says there's a federal regulation, title 9, which requires equal athletic opportunities for boys and girls. Which means--which means if we don't have a girl's football team, we have to let her try out for the grizzlies. That's the law! Man: some law. Coach ainsworth, this is my daughter, tami. hi. hi. Find a spot. Grass drills, larry. Fan out, guys! All right, you heard the man. Jump! All right, wave drill. ♪ here we go, grizzlies, here we go ♪ ♪ here we go, grizzlies, here we go ♪ ♪ here we go, grizzlies, here we go ♪ ♪ here we go, grizzlies, here we go ♪ ♪ here we go, grizzlies, here we go ♪ ♪ here we go, grizzlies, here we go ♪ ♪ here we go, grizzlies, here we go ♪ ♪ here we go-- ♪ whoo! Players: hit! Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit! Win! Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit! Win! Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit! Win! Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit! Win! Hit! All right. Work on the offense. And lean on her a little. All right! Grizzly offense, on the field! Tami, why don't you open as quarterback? You, george and dennis, are wide receivers. That's 20-yard crossing patterns, huh? You know how quarterbacks take a snap in canada? Blue! 44! Set! Hut! Let's go! Movin' out! Good luck. Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back. Blue, 35, set, hut! Come on, blalock, you can do better than that, huh? Pick it up! Let's get it together! Hi, I'm b.j. hi. Damn it! Play ball, son! Set hut! Go long. Set...hut! Yes! Good pass. Hey, little girl, where'd you learn to throw the ball like that? My mom. All right, gather around. Let's run. We're going to have contact drills tomorrow, so check out your equipment, all right? You, too, maida. You can get into pants and t-shirt in the girls' locker room, then come powder up with the team. Final cuts on friday. That's it. Hit the showers! Hey, guys! You made it! No, I didn't make it. No, the final cut's on friday. Friday? Howdy! Mr. Hobart, it's nice to see you! What are you people doing back there in the tent? You didn't leave the key. I forgot. You didn't say one word. About what? About having a daughter wants to play football. I don't remember reading anything that said I had to list all my daughter's extracurricular activities. why? What do the others do? Ha ha. Nothing unusual. Well, it doesn't seem a fit activity for a girl. It's different, if you catch my meaning. Tami, I'd like you to meet our new landlord. Mr. Hobart, my daughter tami. hi. She's not big enough to play football. Pat hayden was only 5'10". You're her father and maybe it's none of my business. But do you think it's proper for a nice little girl like this to--well, I wouldn't want my daughter to be a grizzly. Mr. Hobart, we appreciate your advice. Now, if we could have the key, we'd like to move inside. All right. Rent's due first of the month. I know. Thank you, Mr. Hobart! Ok, gang, let's break camp. Come on. Moving in now, Mr. Penzer! Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Oh, it's stuck. Tami, does this actually fit you? Tami: yep. Oh, that looks terrific. Put it on like this. Mom, can you give me a hand with these? I need to get them on here somehow. Ha ha ha. I was going to sew them under there, but this is stitched all the way through. You're going to need a big, fat needle for that. Maybe underneath? Well, we'll think of something. Look, nobody wants the girl to make the team. That's right. So what is the problem? Off the record-- She's got a good arm. Speed, reactions, good instincts. Ainsworth, you are a young man and this is your first big job, so we're going to pretend that you didn't even say that. That's right. Now, I have seen her and I don't care if she spits bullets, she is still a female and females are different! Right. You can't depend on them. They are weaker. They are injury prone. Now, why even discuss it? Look, Mr. Caine, you don't have to tell me about-- I am telling you, ainsworth. We want a winning season this year. So you just use your best judgment. We could have a winning team if we made-- You're damn right. Hey, maida, welcome to grizzly country. Guys, it's tami maida and her super bra. On the field in 2 minutes. Let's go. Maida, run a couple of plays in there. Just simple handoffs, nothing fancy. Let's go! Ok, on one...set, hut! All right, all right. What's the matter defense, huh? You're playing like you should be wearing dresses. Come on, let's go. Ok, coach, sorry. All right, let's play, you guys. All right, this time let's do 25, all right? On one...set, hut! uh! I'm sorry, you ok? I'm fine. Damn it, brad, don't you apologize to her. Now, this isn't a dancing class...yet! All right, let's go again. Let's go, guys. Let's do the same thing, all right? The same thing. On one... Set, hut! Back off! Back off! All right, save it for the games, grisby! Tami, play football with me. Ok, gidget, I will. I'll play a little bit later, ok? You promised now! In a while. I'll get it. Gidget, move. Hello? yes? It's for you. Hello? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Ok, um, thank you. I made it. yes? What? Just a minute. A reporter wants to know how you feel about making the team. I feel pretty good. Here, you talk to her. Mrs. Maida? Stuart from the "morning herald." I'd like to talk to your daughter about this whole football thing. Well, come on in. No, I'm kim. You're kim. That's tami right there. That's tami. They don't really know yet. I'm looking for tami maida? Maida. Is that her? Excuse me, please. hi. Um, yeah, no, we just had two tryouts so far, so... Yes, she's very happy to be on the team. That's right, canada. I'm here to finish my doctorate at oregon state. Jody, tami, hurry up, you'll be late! Breakfast. Come on, girls. Let's eat. no. Moose and bear. Yes, I'll tell her. Thank you very much for calling. Ok, good-bye. oh! Hello? Yes, she's very happy to be on the team. uh! Ah, go change your blouse. I want to wear this one. You can't wear a buttered blouse to school. It'll attract flies. I don't care. Gidget. No, no, she can't. She has practice every afternoon. No, the evening time, she has to do her homework. Yes, I will. I appreciate your calling. Thank you, good-bye. They're still calling? It never stops. Back in the box! I wish they'd leave us alone. I mean, it's nobody's business what my measurements are or if I have a boyfriend. What am I supposed to say to them? huh! What does "huh" mean? You think you're such hot stuff because everyone's been making such a deal about you. I do not. I hate it! Bull! What do you mean bull? You never even say anything about this? Stop it now. There's no room for bickering in this house. Do you understand? Dad, I was not bickering. All this attention is like a puff of smoke. It's going to blow away before you know it. But before it does, we're all going to be affected by it in one way or another. The important thing is we all have to stick together. We're a family. Right? Right. Right. Right. Right. Ok, let's eat. Gidget! Coming, mommy! Gidget! Come on! Hurry! ok. We spent the night at perry's. It's really wild. ooh. All right. ho! Ha ha! John elliot? Here. Darlene fox. Here. Caroline hobbs. Here. Deanna lyons. Here. Janelle lee. Here. Tami maida. Here. Well, we are honored to have the lady athlete in our classroom. Thank you. Dale petrie. Dale petrie! Here. Thank you. Ken richards. Hey, one second. hey! Hey! You're new here, right? Yeah. How come you haven't been in to see me? I'm sorry, I don't know who you-- Oh, I'm scott massey. I'm the school orientation officer. They didn't tell you about me, right? They? No, I'm sorry. They didn't. See, I'm responsible for making sure, uh, new students are familiarized with the school. Like, for instance, do you, uh... Do you know where the library is? The lunchroom? The gym? The principal's office? no. All that stuff. That's what I'm here for-- To help you out. Like if you've got a question or, uh... You want to go to a movie or something. Tami, you met scott already, huh? It figures. Don't believe a word he says. Tami. Why do I know that name, huh? Tami maida. Come on, tami maida, our new quarterback. Is that the female football player? No, you're not. I mean, she's got to be...you are? Come on, what is this, a joke, huh? Nope. She really is? Yeah. You really are? Mm-hmm. It was nice meeting you. I'll see you later. See ya. She really is? Yeah. See ya. Mrs. Maida, might we have a word with you? Woman to woman? Sure. We're, um, concerned mothers. And we want you to reconsider. Reconsider what? Allowing your daughter to play with the grizzlies. why? It's improper. It's not decent. why? Girls belong with other girls. She's disrupting the whole school. The board approved her tryout. And the coach accepted her on the team. How can that be wrong? We don't want women's lib in minnville. We raise our daughters to be ladies. Wait a minute. You know, you're amazing, you really are. My daughter wants to play a game. If the law gives her the right and god gave her the ability, who are you to say that she can't? But you don't understand what we're trying to say to you. Never mind, never mind. Get back to me when you've elected a spokes--person. set! Roger, roger. He's our man. If he can't do it, no one can. Set, hut! Ready, hit it! Chuck, chuck. He's our man. If he can't do it, no one can. Tami, tami. I'd like to see her do that under pressure. Maida, rest that arm, huh? Tami? Ready, hit it. Tami, tami. She's our man. If she can do it, anyone can. Look, I'm trying to get along here, ok? Sometimes it's not easy. What do you mean? Just don't give me a hard time, all right? What, are you threatening me? Just lay off. Coach: jog it in! A little hustle, guys, a little hustle. You know why the school hasn't installed artificial turf? Because the cheerleaders need a place to graze. But the minute she probably got him up on the moose. She probably stole it from a moose. Funny, funny. Can I--can I sit here? Sure. You're the girl who plays football. Mm-hmm. I'm--i'm impressed. Yeah? Yeah. You're the first. I'm tami maida. Carolyn hobbs. hi. Sorry. How do you do it? I mean, you could get squashed. Aren't you terrified every second? I'm nervous a little, but excited, too. I wish I had your nerve. You do? Yeah. Hey, tami, how's it going? hi. hi. Chuck, b.j., this is... Carolyn. Carolyn. Hi, carolyn. Check this out. Ready for practice? Yeah. All right. See you there. Nice meeting you. bye. bye. Boy, I would die if I had to practice with them every day. The first time I had my tryout, they were all in lines doing calisthenics, right? I don't think they even knew I was going to be there. I walk up. Suddenly, everybody stops. They all stare at you? All of them. I stopped and very slowly walked to the ground. Here? Yeah. Thanks for the ride. Sure, but don't tell my father. ok. Is it true they named the team grizzlies after him? Yeah. Pop's pretty intense most of the time. Nobody's ever good enough to please him, including me. Well, especially me. You're all-state center. He wanted me to be all-state quarterback. hmm. And team captain, student body president, most popular, most representative, most handsome. I decided to concentrate on most handsome. So don't let him get to you. Him or anybody around here. Just... Keep on keeping on. ok? ok. Thanks. Sure. See you tomorrow. See you. Tami! Oh, boy! Hey, guys, how was school? How was practice? It was all right. Did you tackle anyone? Oh, some. Was it fun? No, it wasn't. All the kids at school knew I was your sister. how? 'cause you told them. So? I need 7 autographs. She's selling them. It's a lie! Are you going to be in the game friday night? Um, I don't know. Ok, men! Strap them down! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! P.a.: here comes the minnville grizzlies! Come on, maida! Coach, the crowd is really pumped up. Are you going to start the girl quarterback? no. How has she been looking in practice? The whole team is looking real well. I'm looking forward to a real exciting game. I'm talking specifically about tami maida. I'm not. Now, listen! Think out there! Execute, concentrate. Let's go. Ok! Kio! P.a.: roger kio at quarterback. 3! 14! Set! Hut! Man: pass! Pass! Man: go, big red! Crowd: go, big red! Go, big red! Man: tighten it up!

P.a.: and now, coming into the game at quarterback is number 10--tami maida. Ok, guys. Red, 23, die, on one. Centers. Ready? All: play! Man: girl, I'll put my arms around you. Baby! The pressure. You can squeeze me, blondie! 3, 19, 6, hut! Hut! Get that dumb bimbo out of there! Come on, tami! P.a.: no gain by maida. No harm. Now, let's move that ball. Ok. Red, 37 blast, on one. Centers.

Dad! That was incredible. This is incredible. It was like everything was in slow motion. At the same time. Oh, that's fantastic. Oh, we're so proud of you, honey. I'll be right back. I'll meet you in the car, all right? Right. Hey! Hey, tami! Tami! Great... day. Quiet down, quiet down. Having a girl quarterback, did you think she could get the ball to you? No, yeah, yeah. I knew she could make it. We've been working out at practice. She's got good timing. What about the confidence in the huddle? Were people skeptical that she could do the job? No, not at all. Huh? No, no. Shh! Guys, guys. Hey, b.j., you've been supporting her all along. Do you think that she's finally proven herself now? Oh, she's proven herself. She's proven herself the first day. She's the best. She's the best. Number one! I know when you were sitting on the bench, you were probably not thinking you'd probably actually get into the football game. You did and you won. It's got to be a great feeling. Yeah! shh! Um, yeah, it is. I was real excited. I was a little nervous though. What was your feeling when you got put into the ballgame? Were you concerned? Were your nervous? "please don't let me fumble this." That's the first thing I did. Hey, canada. hi. How are you doing? Good. I watched the game. Yeah, so did i, most of it. No, you were--you were fantastic, I mean, when you got in. No, I wasn't fantastic, but thank you. You were. You were, really. I've never seen a girl play as good as you did. Actually, I'd never seen a girl play at all, but you were really good. Thanks. I'm in athletics, too. Yeah? Yeah. So are you doing anything tomorrow afternoon? no. Because I was--I was thinking maybe-- You'd maybe want to go out with me. Like, I don't know, if you didn't have any other plans or anything. No, I don't. That would be nice. Really? Yeah. Great. I guess maybe I'll pick you up around noon. ok. Dress casual. ok. See you later. bye. ohh. ohh. Ohh. Where we going? Come on. It's over here. Not far. Whoo! Yeah! Great, huh? Yeah. This is where I work out. With what? You play football. I do logging. You know, lumberjack events--tree climbing, sawing, log rolling-- That kind of stuff. There's a tournament next month. I'm defending regional all-around champ. Congratulations. Here, put these on. You're going to love this. Whoo! Yeah. Whoo! Come on! Keep your hand open, come on. Come on, it's easy. There you go. That's right, just one hand after the other. All right. Come on. All right, you got it. A little more. There you go. unh! All right. Good work. Let's go. Um... Come on. This is the best one. After I get across, i'll swing it back to you. All right? Ready? Whoo! uhh. Got it? Just grab onto the rope. Whoo! There you go. ah! Come on. You ok? You got it. Both hands up. There you go. Whoa. All right. That was great. You're ok. No, I'm not ok. Sure. Ah. You ever done any tree climbing before? no. Here, take these. What are you trying to prove? Nothing. I just figured you'd have a good time, that's all. You take all your dates out here to show them a good time? No, most girls would probably hate this. I hate this! I just thought because you were in athletics and stuff, you'd like to go out-- I thought this was a date, not an athletic competition. I get enough of that in football. See? I mean, how am I supposed to know what you like? You're so different from other girls. No, I'm not. I'm not. I mean, I sure get treated that way by everybody. The coach treats me different because i'm not a boy. You treat me different because I play football, right? They treat me different because they don't know what I am. Well, here's the news. I'm a girl. Have you got that? I'm a girl. I am! That was no win. It wasn't a win. That was a gift from the other team. For crying out loud, keep her on the bench! You know, I hate to say this, but she's as good as kio. And she's better than blalock. It's impossible. Look, you're the coach, coach him! Oh, I wish I didn't like him. That is a little proud-- Hey, carolyn. I have my brother's car tonight. We're going to go out to alf's. Want to come? Sure, fabulous. Hey, I'll bet you like it. Uh, can she come with us? Yeah. Whatever. That's all right, thanks. Ah, come on. It'll be a kick. ok. Great, we'll do it. See you tonight. bye. You're right. Maybe it's a good idea for me to be with some girls for a change. What is alf's? Beats me. Swell. Oh, look, there's marvin. Oh, and dennis. And roger. Yeah, grizzlies. What are you doing, maida? Breaking training? hi. hi. hi. How did you do on the biology quiz? Oh, bummer, I should have studied. I'll help you study anytime. I'm great in biology. I bet. You will lose. What do you mean you'll lose? I'm great in biology. Ah, shut up. I bet I'm better than all of you. Where were you guys last weekend? Rick's party. Yeah. Oh, rick's? Weren't you guys there? Yeah, I was there. What time were you there? We got there about 11:30. Hey, there. Hi. Having a good time? no. I figured you'd be with scott. Hey, tami, listen up. We've just been working on a new play for you. Set up in the "r" formation. Look at this, look at this. Hey, watch the wax job, muck head. What wax job? Hey, this is going to blow you away. Check it out. Ok. You're back here, "i" formation, tight end. Tight, real tight. I'm open wide, right? You draw back, tight end swipes right across the middle. It's perfect. It's our play. 6, right there. Isn't that a great setup? 7 yard slam. Come on, maida! You're not listening up, huh? We're in there. Touchdown. 6. What do you think, huh? Yeah. Could work. Yeah! Hello, bedford falls! Merry christmas! Merry christmas, george! Merry christmas, george! Merry christmas, movie house! Merry christmas, emporium! Merry christmas, you wonderful old building and loan! You waited up? oh. I just got involved in this movie. Hey! Merry christmas, mr. Potter! I get choked up every time I see it. And to you! In jail! Go on home. They're waiting for you! Mary! Mary! Mary! Well, hello, mr. Bank examiner! How are you? You want to talk about it? What? Whatever it is that's making your face look like a foot. Everybody acts like I'm from mars... Except the guys on the team and they all act like I'm just another guy on the team. Well, aren't you? Yeah. I just don't know where I fit in. Maybe I'm just weird. You're not weird. You're just growing up. Are you happy? I mean, being a woman? Being married? Having all of us? You know I'm happy. I did want to be a singer... But then I met your father and, suddenly, it wasn't important anymore. Of course, there wasn't any real choice then. I mean, a woman was expected to marry a man and start having babies and raise a family and live happily ever after. But I'm glad I made that choice. And, yeah, I'm happy. But, you know, you can do anything. You can have everything. You can even play football if you want. The trouble is that attitudes just haven't kept up with the opportunities. And some people think a girl grizzly makes their team a joke. And they're frightened... Because to them you represent a world they just don't understand. That's a heavy load to lay on someone. Well, it's not the end of the world. You can always quit. I don't want to quit. Oh, tami. Come here. Ohh. I love you. All right, that wasn't a win friday. That was a gift. I've seen harder hitting in supermarkets by little old ladies with shopping carts. Grigsby, blalock, what's so funny? You guys couldn't hit anybody unless they bumped into you first. All right, give me 2 laps. Try to finish by dark. The rest of you guys get back to your drills. Your pants, brian! All right, linemen, line backers--to the sleds. Ends, centers, backs. Over here. Maida, let's talk. Let's go! The coach is starting kio again. oh. But stay alive. I'm getting you in as early as possible. I'm going to start working roger at halfback. Um, meaning what? You take game pressure better. How we doing, Mr. Penzer? ohh! I'm being attacked by midgets. You play around, you lay around. Man: hey, get off of me! Second man: do some work! Mr. Penzer said we're building the garden spot of america. Heh heh. Leave Mr. Penzer alone and help me with this ladder, would you? Ok. At your service, madam! Man, you'd never catch my mother climbing around a ladder like that. Ever notice that most parents seem older than they should? Yours seem younger. Yeah, I guess they're not exactly typical, are they? Hey, slaves! No work, no lunch! He's worse than the coach. Listen, if you guys don't want to hang around, it's fine, really. Hey, no way do we let the grizzly soon-to-be-starting qb mess with manual labor. Yeah, man, you could bust a fingernail or something. There goes the magic hands of maida for the rest of the season and I'd have to play. Here. Don't hurt yourself. All right. I need it. oh! You did that on purpose! No, I really didn't. Just go ahead and laugh! Because all the school is laughing at you ever since we got here. You think you're so great parading around because you're better than us. Just because you're on tv. I don't care! I don't want to be on tv! I don't want to be your sister! P.a.: grizzlies 3, mustangs 7. Come on, kio! Let's get it together, rog! 2, for 3! Set, hut! P.a.: kio is tackled, second and 8! All right, take over, maida. P.a.: number 10, tami maida, replacing kio as quarterback. I told ainsworth! A girl cannot play football! We're going red, 38 counter on one. Centers. On one. Ready! All: break! Hey, little girl! You're going to get creamed! We're going to blitz you, baby! 4, 19, set, hut! P.a.: maida, thrown for a loss. Third and 11. You ok? All right, let's go. Huddle it up! Huddle it up! All right, let's go. They're sending everybody at you. Yeah, no kidding. All right. We're going to concede the rush and fake them with a sucker play. All right? What sucker play? That's our play. That's the one we drew on my car. I wasn't there. What am I doing? Checking-- It's the 7-yard curl. All right. You got it? Yeah. All right. Lem and I pass to the tight end on one. Centers. On one. Ready? All: break! Go left! 4, 29, set, hut! Come on! They hit before that! Going red, 34, dive in one. Hut, hut! Ok, listen up, we're changing it. We're changing it. Red, 28 blast, wing back in motion on 3. Centers? Roger, go for it all. Ready? All: break! 4, 89, set, hut, hut! A cheap shot, you lousy-- P.a.: touchdown! Crowd: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Yeah, whoo. Ha ha! We did it! You guys, we are the best! Yes! What the hell are you doing out there, huh? uh! Hey, hey, hey! ah! No way coach going to start you from now on. Or you. I hope not. My old man wants me to get a varsity letter. I don't care if I never get in the game. Stay healthy, you know? I know. Oh, did you hear what scott did after the game? No, what? He picked a fight with that linebacker who took all those late hits on you. He what? I guess you got a bodyguard, huh? Is he here? Yeah, he's over there. Um, scott, could I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, ok. In private. All right. Who asked you to fight my battles? What? Don't give me "what." You got that eye from that guy who kept decking me. He made me mad. So what? I don't need you sticking up for me, all right? If I can't take my hits out there like everybody else, I shouldn't be out there. No, but you're a girl. Isn't that what you said? Yes, but not when I'm playing. Well, what are you then? What do you mean, what am i? Look, maybe putting all those--all those pads makes you forget that you're a girl. But I know what's underneath. Look...when I'm playing... When I'm not playing, i'm a girl, yes. But when I'm playing, i'm not a male exactly, but I'm not a girl either. That doesn't mean that-- no. Football doesn't-- It's kind of confusing, huh? Yeah. Want to try and work it out after the game next week? Yeah. Good game. Thanks. I didn't mean some of those things that I said the other day. ok. I didn't mean any of them. I'm sorry. It's ok. It's just...i just feel so jealous lately. I can't stand it, tami. Gidget and jody and heidi, they're crazy about their sister. It's only you. Like I don't even exist or something. I never meant for any of this to happen. You know that. But you're right. I've only been thinking about myself lately and I'm sorry, too. Are we sisters again? And you were right about something else. What? I'm just a joke at school. Tiffany upchurch is a dip. You're right. Guess what? I'm going out after the next game with scott massey. Are you kidding? That's great. But this time you have to do it right, ok? ok. What are you going to wear? I don't know, you have any ideas? My beige sweater. No, that's too small. Right. You may call it football. I don't call it football. 10-7, that's a legitimate win, Mr. Caine. 10-7. I wouldn't call it decisive. Grizzlies got the fever, we're rocking to the beat! Hey, grizzlies! Whoo! Pour on the heat! Ok, guys, let's show them we're grizzlies. Red, 184, sprint on one. Centers on one. Ready? All: right! Yeah! Did you see that? Set, hut! P.a.: fourth quarter touchdown. They're working . They are. I've had a run-in with them a couple of times. Have you? Oh, I feel so bad. Well, thank you. I had a--I had a good time. Yeah? Yeah. ohh. Listen, I wanted to apologize, you know. why? I had a really good time. No, I mean, from before--coming on-- Coming on like a super jock, you know. And then punching that guy out last week. It was stupid. That's ok. I just wasn't prepared for you. I mean, all this. Listen, you and the rest of this town. Well, no, i'm not like them. It's just I figure a girl wants to play football, go for it, right. But I also figured she'd probably be 6'3" with tattoos or something, you know. Then you show up. You changed your mind? No, not exactly. I just never dated a quarterback before. Hey, it's different when it gets personal. See, first, i, ahem... I was afraid you'd think I was a wimp, you know, because I'm not on the team. And then I was afraid... I was afraid what the other guys would say if--if I took you out, you know, in public. Listen, if you don't want to be seen with me-- Tami, it's ok. I worked it out. I realize I'm going to get a lot of ribbing and stuff but that's ok. I can take it. I'm a big guy. Well, I'm real proud of you, scott. I'm proud of you, too. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! We've all been covering the story of minnville's unique young quarterback. Pat albert followed up on the story. You guys sounds like you were never worried at all. Oh, here it comes. How do you feel about her playing for the grizzlies? Terrific. I understand you're a psychologist and a moose hunter. No, no, I'm a moose psychologist. I treat psychologically disturbed moose, many of whom become very depressed during the hunting season. Ha ha ha! Reporter: right. Uh... Mrs. Maida, do you have a--are you afraid at all about tami getting hurt out there? No, she's too good. Ooh, ahh. You look cute. What are you talking about? Ok, so how about it? It's our only overnight trip. It's only one night. I want to stay with the team. Will they give you your own room? No, but I'll be with the team. Then I have to take you. Mom, to the team I'm just another one of the guys. No, seriously. Besides, it's going to be 4 in a room, so that means I'll be sleeping with 3 guys. I'm going to go study before I have a heart attack. Come on, what could happen in a room with 3 boys? You want to take that, doctor? No way. You are so antediluvian. Tami, there's got to be a limit to your intimacy with the team. Now, either I take you and we stay in a room together or you stay here. We can't afford that. We'll scrimp. She's home. They're here. You're back! ohh! Did you win? Oh, tell me everything. What--what happened? What on earth happened? What did the doctor say? Are you ok? Easy, easy, easy, easy. What's the matter? What happened? Oh, the doctor said it's a bad sprain. I had to go on the first play. But I got right up, dad, I never cried. Tami: the wolverines beat us 38 to 7. Honey. hey. Don't you know you have a right to cry? You don't always have to be the toughest kid on the block. Good, because I'm not. P.a.: good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the northwest high school logging competition. This year we have the same events as last year. We have , we have axe , log rolling, and tree climbing. High school loggers will be competing against one another on head-to-head competition. This year we have a fine match between scott massey and donny montgomery for the all-around. And today is going to decide who will be the all-round champion. Woman: ready? 1, 2, go. Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! yay! Whoo! Yeah! P.a.: this is it, this is for all the marbles. The winner here will be the all-around logger. man: 1, 2, go! Whoo! You all right? I'm ok. You sure? Let me help you. I'm ok. This happens all the time. You want to lean on me? No, I'm ok. Come charging and holding me up. It's embarrassing. I'm sorry. I thought you were hurt. I'm not. P.a.: ladies and gentlemen, the tree-climbing winner and the new all-around champion--donnie montgomery. It's not bad enough I lose. I gotta get carried off the field by a lady quarterback. I didn't carry you. Besides, I thought we've been through all of this. Yeah, we have. It just rubbed the wrong way for a second, ok? What? That I'm a lady or that I'm a quarterback? I wouldn't mind either if you weren't both. Well, I am. At least for one more game. And if that bothers you, then I'm real sorry. Hey, canada! Come on! Damn. I'd make a great homecoming princess, I'm perfect. How can you resist? You've got to vote for me. Tami! What happened between you and scott? Nothing. Look at tiffany upchurch. I've never seen anyone campaign so hard for homecoming princess. Listen, I'll see you later, ok? We've got to go. Ok, see ya. I told you--a female couldn't hold up. You've been on my back all season. We are 6 and one and in the championship. Now is there anything wrong with that? Yeah, but now you've got to hold the quarterback. Now we're going to see what kind of a coach you are. Friday's it. It's the last game. We do not want to end the season with 2 losses, right? All: right! We do not want to lose. All: right! So what are we going to do about it? All: win! What are we going to do? All: win! I can't hear you guys. All: win! That's right. So no last week let up. I want 110% from every one of you on every play at every practice. You got it? All: yeah! All right, hit it! All right, offense, defense. Down in here. Let's go. Easy on that ankle, maida. Ok, we're going to work some diving plays, huh? Ok, we go red, 34, dive, on one, ok? What's so funny? Nothing. Blue-- Hey, tami! What? I forgot to mention. I nominated you for homecoming princess. You what? Homecoming princess, I nominated you. By now you're all familiar with the grizzlies' girl quarterback. Well, now her classmates at minnville high have nominated her for homecoming princess. As you can see, they have been training hard... What an arm. No matter the outcome, the minnville grizzlies will have a season to remember... Look at you! And what about the rumor that b.j. Caine, their all-state center is running for Miss oregon? Whoo! But tami, if you're going to run for homecoming princess, you'll need a beautiful gown and stuff. Oh, yeah. I bet they cost a lot of money. Let's talk about it later, ok? Reporter: what an interesting situation. The coaches are very high on her. She's got great energy. The kids are all behind her. May I help you? Oh, ok. Um, we're looking for a, uh, like a formal. Fine, and who would this be for? Oh, a friend of ours. I see. Would you know the size? Oh, she comes up to about here on me. Um, the program says she's 5'6", 120 pounds. And she's, uh, um, built. Come on, man. Built? Isn't she? Yeah. Yeah, she's built. Oh. Why, this is the girl that plays football over at the high school. Got it. I think it's absolutely marvelous what she's doing. Just marvelous. Right, right. And you know she's running for homecoming princess. So we took up a collection to buy her a nice dress. Oh, you're her playmates. Teammates. Yeah, teammates. Teammates, teammates. Yes, now, how much were you prepared to spend? Um, we have almost $125. oh. Oh, well, I'm sure that we can find something absolutely sensational for that. Why don't you just follow me, boys? Why don't you take a look at these gowns over here and I'll be at the back for just a moment. Hey, cut it out. Jerk. Ahem. I think this would be perfect for her. Can we have that for-- $125. Hey, all right. Thanks, hon. yep. bye. bye. Good morning, Mr. Klosterman! Have a nice day, Mr. Klosterman! Keep smiling, Mr. Klosterman! Thank you very much, mr. Klosterman. I'll keep smiling, too. Or maybe you could stop by for a cup of coffee afterwards. Mrs. Maida... Do you have time for a cup of coffee? Uh... Sure. Well, is tami better after her accident? Well, she, um...she wants so badly to play that she acts like she is. We can't even keep her away from practice. Ohh. Well, I do hope she'll be all right. You know, I never kept up with sports before you folks moved in. But now after seeing her on tv all the time makes it very interesting. And she always conducts herself like a perfect lady. Oh, I don't mean just on tv. We see her around the house, too--all your daughters. You must be very proud. I am. Uh... None of us around here knew quite what to expect when we first heard who was moving into the hobart place. So...we were all... Pretty cool at first. I don't need to tell you that. no. no. But now even mr. Klosterman was just speaking how pleased he is to have you folks in the neighborhood. Could have fooled me. Oh, you know men. Sometimes they strike first impressions about people and then they change their minds, but they can never seem to find a way to admit it. Some men are so stubborn they can't come right out and admit it when they're wrong... And say, uh... "i'm sorry." Do you know, I almost forgot. I've got a coffee ring warming in the oven. It's an old family recipe... And I'd hope you like it. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Oh! Ahh! She trying it on? Yeah. They won't let us in to see. What, the dress is no good? Oh, it's great. This bonehead mouthed off. I said she looks a little effeminate. Just glad the hocks won't see her looking like that. Why not? She's like a whole other person. Like who? Like a woman. I don't know. I'm kind of nervous. Why? I'm going to be there. You can't be nervous. no. Hey, tami. We voted for you. Thanks. Hee hee. Stop looking at me like that. I'm not winning. You're so cynical. I'm not going to-- Tami. Tami, I just wanted to wish you well in the election. May the best man win. Thank you, tiffany. No hard feelings. You and I haven't been real close, have we? No, and I regret that. Sincerely? Desperately. I've kind of enjoyed it. Let's keep it that way. Stop. Don't laugh right there in her face. It makes it worse. Hello. Hey, canada. Hey there. How are you doing? Good. Hey, what's the latest? Well, she's determined to play. But the coach says he doesn't intend to use her, so there's nothing to worry about...maybe. Tami: hi. Tami, how you doing? Yeah, we should go. Tami. Yeah. We don't want you getting hurt. I won't, I promise. Ready? Yeah, yeah. Whoa. Be careful. I'm fine. Good luck, girl! Keep your knickers dry!
