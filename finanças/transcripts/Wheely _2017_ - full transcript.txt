KRU International presents... ...a production of Kartun Studios. Wheely Fast & Hilarious Look who decided to show up, Mr. Newbie on Wheels. Hey, Joe. What's up? I have let you stay at the front for too long. Seriously, shouldn't you be on display in some museum by now? Let's see if you can move as fast as that mouth! He's gonna get it! That's it. He's going to get beat! Extreme super jump! Prepare to be beaten by my speed,... ...with this 500 horsepower engine. Such an amazing race! A neck and neck race between two best racers... ...in this year's final championship. Who would have thought this race would be this tight? In my pre-season analysis, I did point out... ...that things would be close. Just like the race in '86... -...when I was commenting... -Anyhow, let us watch... ...Wheely O' Wheels, the rookie star from Gasket City... ...now accelerates into the lead! Get out of the way! But of course, he is up against the all-time favourite racer, Joe-Flow. Our four times winner! Three times winner. Yeah, whatever. -Now, Joe moves to the front. -Come on, Mr. Wheely. Wheely O' Wheely has no chance of winning. You don't know him like I do. You know him? Of course I know him! But he doesn't know me. Passing through! Ten cars in a row breaking the speed limit! We better get some backup from the station! It's race day today, ma’am. The streets are closed for racing. It's completely legal today, ma'am. I missed out my chance. Turn around, Wheely. Are you okay? This is really nerve-racking. Finally we have reached my favourite portion of the race,... ...which is this fantastic tubular course in a drainpipe! I can't wait to destroy you. What happens inside, stays inside. I'm going to lose this way. Nobody knows who will emerge victorious. In my day, the racers just stayed on the road. I bet Joe Flow's gonna lead the tubular course! He is just fantastic. Are you sure about that? My money is on Wheely. We'll see. Being here is such a bad idea, though. Wheely, over here! Did you get my macho poses? Move it. Have you ever been slapped when driving? Take this! Cool stuff! And the oil's not bad either. Calling Could you deliver some of the best oil to me? I'm Wheely O'Wheels. Yes, I'm Wheely O'Wheels. Make sure to send it over to the finishing line... ...because I'm the one who's gonna win this. See you later! Hey! One Petro-Oil Super Special for O'Wheels! For Wheels? Has my dream come true? Is it true that he orders it? Finishing line. I'll get this to him myself! Hey. Sorry, this one's mine. And no shortcuts! No worries. This is me, Putt Putt. Mr. Wheely, here I come. This is taking forever. Excuse. I have to do some delivery. Special delivery! Finally, I get past the crowd. VIPS only, buddy. But I have VID! "Very Important Delivery" for Mr. Wheely! Sure you have. Ladies and gentlemen,... ...now, we have come to the last part of the race,... ...with Joe Flow and Wheely O'Wheels still in the lead! Who's going to take the chequered flag? I can't wait any longer! A dramatic race, indeed. We're just moments away from crowning our new champion. I failed. They say failure is not fatal. But if I fail in my job, I will be sacked. God, only you can help me. And why is there a hole in the road? It's a shortcut. But boss said I shouldn't take a shortcut. But it's the only way. What is this slimy thing? It's poop! Out of my way! Where am I? There's a lot of people here. Get out of the way! Move it! It's slippery! -Did he really say that? -No doubt about it. I guess I was right about that man. Mom, I think what he said was... Get down! It's ticklish. There's a train coming. I'm screwed. Oh this ain't gonna be good! Help! A car flying! There goes all of my fish. Mr. Wheely! What have I done? What happened? Who just drowned? One year later... You woke up early today. Where are you heading to? I need to go out, Momma. Wait a second, son. No son of mine is leaving without having a proper breakfast! Anyone near Gasket City? I don't have time for breakfast, Momma. I need to go to the city. This early in the morning? Of course. I have to work hard to earn money. I will fix this place up... ...so that we'll be getting more customers. I appreciate that, son. But you've got to remember that you're not what you used to be. I got that. Don't worry! I just want you to know how much I love you. I love you too. Mama's Garage Gas O Line Hello, Mr. Yellow. How are you on this glorious morning, Mr. Wheely? Mr. Wheely is fed up with everyone checking up on me. I'm not checking up on anyone, just you! Mr. Wheely, wait up! Don't stop in the middle of the road. Would you stop following me around? I've got a job to do in the city. I dont want anyone following me around. Alright, I'll make sure that no one follows you around. I appreciate the concern, but I can handle this myself! I got it, Mr Wheely. I'm just worried about you, Mr. Wheely. Mrs. Momma said Mr. Wheely should take good care and be careful. I will look after Mr. Wheely. I'm okay. You're not okay, Mr. Wheely. -I'm okay. -Don't deny it. Why is everyone got to be all up in my grill? I'm totally cool. I mean I got a junky axle, but yea I'm alive. I can still drive. I'm still okay. Hey, are you Wheely? Joe, is that a hood job? You look familiar. You're Wheely, right? You look "good". What's up? New paint job? Let's go, guys. I'm tired of seeing this guy's face. Catch up soon! What a big show! Time to go! Get moving, will you?! How could they treat me like this? They just tossed me aside. It's a no brainer. O'Wheely. Your passenger is waiting at Gasket City. Get there in 5 minutes, or you're fired! Guys, look behind us. There's a cranky taxi trying to get past us. He thinks he's fast enough. No way! That doesn't sound good. You'd better get an upgrade if you want to race with us! You're not in our league. See you later! You, over there! Why do we always have to start shooting so early? So the city will be quiet. No paparazzi, no fans. Yeah, you're right. Whatever you say, Mr. Director. Hello, Bella speaking... Hi, babe, it's me. Ben, where are you? You said you were going to be here. Stop calling me Ben. Call me "baby". Sorry darling, I have loads to do for tonight's party. You better not be late, I want to show you off to everyone! Of course, I'll be there. -But are you coming to see me on set? -Alright, babe. See you later. Listen up! Come on, get in position! Check the lights! Where is the talent? Is the talent ready? Filming in Progress It gives you more boom for zoom,... ...Petro-Oil Super Special. That was really great, Bella. But could we do it one more time? But this time, act like you really like the product? Everyone, get in position. And action! What are you doing here? Is this in the script? Hey, look out! Sorry, are you okay? Of course you're okay. Oh, you're more than fine, girl. But do I know you? You're Bella di Monetti! The Petro-oil Super Special Girl! More Boom for my Zoom! I know who am I. But the question is, who are you? Come on, let's get out of here. Let's go to Gasket Central. Oh my, I shouldn't be here. Just pretend like I don't exist. Just act like nothing's happened. Excuse me! Are you sure this is the final draft of the script? Freeze! Hands up! What? Litter? That's a contravention of Highway by-way law 2274 subsection B. Am in pursuit of domestic refuse. Description - small, white plastic cup. The height is about 15 cm... I got hit. Holy smokes! Speeding, illegal racing,... ...driving without due care and attention. They're going to be sorry they ever turned down Sergeant Street's street. Aggravation and assault on a police officer! Wait till I get some clamps on them! Hey, watch it! Stop! A taxi moonlighting as a racer? Say no more! I know an illegal racer when I see one. You're under arrest for disturbing the peace and for illegal racing! But I haven't done anything wrong. Ma'am, your son's been charged with illegal racing. Unfortunately, we couldn't detain the other culprits. So, we're going to release him on bail. But I tell you know that he's going to be monitored. He wouldn't be able to sneeze... ...without us knowing it. I promise, Officer. I won't let this happen again. Call me Sergeant, ma'am. And keep a close eye on him. I though I had raised you better than that! Going off racing... ...when you're not supposed to? You're making me feel ashamed. I'm sorry, Momma. I got caught up in the moment. I saw them racing, and I can't help it anymore. -I just have to join them. -But you're a taxi. Not a racer. I just don't want you get into any troubles. Your mom is just worried about you, Mr. Wheely. Yeah, I messed up big time. Cafe have to close. I've used up the money I saved for restaurant repair to bail you out. Oh, no. It's fine, Mr. Wheely. It's okay to look into the past, as long as we learn something from it. What are you talking about? It's an old saying. Whatever. Mr. Wheely, your axle isn't in a very good shape. Enough! Stop talking about this. I'm fine. Look at my hand! My leg too. Everything is fine. You can't even tell the difference between a wheel and a hand. It must be because of the accident. I have been looking all over for someone to fix Mr. Wheely. Please fix me! It's all my fault. Please tell me that you can fix him. Wait a minute. What is this? This too. This is just a junk. Watch out. Wait up. Hand it over. Quick. Sure, just don't throw it at me. I don't know what really happened to your friend. What's this? I need some spare parts. So, you need to find them. I can save him, really. Don't worry about it. But with one condition, he can't race anymore. You've got to be kidding me. Do you know that racing is in his blood? Do you think I care about that? Look at this. I can't do anything with this broken axle. I don't have a spare axle here. Plus, they don't make this part anymore. It's discontinued. You might want to ask him to try basketball instead. Maybe you guys can form a team. Putt Putt, enough of your flashbacks. I'm just gonna check on Momma if she ever needs anything. But you just stay here. What's that? It tickles! Who's that? Bella, darling. Who's talking? Putt Putt, that phone belongs to Bella di Monetti. This is not Bella, I'm Wheely. -Wheely? -Yes, Wheely. -May I know who's speaking? -Who are you? Where's Bella? You stole my girlfriend's phone. If you don't wanna get into any troubles,... ...you'll return this phone to Hub-Bonnet Mansion. Any problem? I got Bella's phone. I don't wanna waste any time. I'm gonna return it right away. After meeting her, I wanna marry her. I wanna have kids with her. Come on, don't dawdle. This is my chance. Alright. Yes, Mr. Wheely. I'm happy for you. Let's us earn some money and repair Momma's cafe. You do good, Mr. Wheely. You shouldn't get influenced by your peers, Ben. Stop fooling around and wasting time. No, I don't. In fact, I woke up early today. 3 P.M. Ben, I know that partying is fun and all. I led the same life as you do now. What are you talking about? You know what turned my life around? A mini roundabout? Your mother. Meeting your mother was the best thing ever happened to me. You need a strong lady like your mom in your life. Do you like her because she's beautiful? It's not her beauty. It's her attitude. Bella is perfect for you. I want you to announce a marriage date as soon as possible. Daddy, I haven't even proposed to her. You're both here. Do it- or else! When did she arrive? I didn't see her. Now, what's the latest news on the car-napping ring? This mansion is huge. I can't believe Bella hangs out with this kind of crowd. But how do we get in? Mr. Wheely, this is a bad idea. But I have a worse idea. I got it. So, I'm gonna get inside, sweep her off her tyres... ...and hand over her phone. I'm Wheely O'Wheels! This is a private property. You can't get in without invitation. I don't wanna laugh at you, but please listen to my idea. I don't want your idea. Yeah, I got it. If we can't get through the front door, we get through the back door. If we still fail, we can use the emergency door. Nothing's gonna stop me, Wheely O'Wheels. Just this time. Just once, listen to me so that we can get inside. Why didn't you just say so? I've got these two up in my sleeve. Why did you take these out? Just for the two of us. You're amazing. Indeed. Now, I feel like a secret agent. Putt Putt, you're a genius. No, Mr. Wheely. You have to be a waiter. Oh, a secret agent pretending to be a waiter. Alright. Just don't blow your cover. Welcome to the Hub Bonnet Mansion, Lord Archibald. Are you sure we're out of sight? No, I can still see you. No, not you. I meant... Forget it. What's this? Why do you call me? Are you two finally in position? Yes, boss. Just like you said,... ...this place is brimming with money. Of course I was right. I'm the boss. -Did you bring the over rider? -Yes, we got it here. Now, wait for my signal. Watch where you're going. If there are any cars delivered with dents and scratches,... ...I'll knock you into the ocean. If the over rider works,... ...we can go fully automated... ...and forget about having these useless trucks around. Load them up. Where am I? Where are we going? Okay. Okay, just try to blend in. Can I have a glass of petrol? Daisy! Sorry, love! I mean, this looks like a daisy. Look. But it is actually a coconut tree. It looks like a daisy. But it is a coconut tree. What are you talking about? Are you just going to stand there? Go and serve the guests. Hey, do I look like a waiter to you? Of course I do. Because I am a waiter. Not really a waiter,... ...but it is my job to wait. I have to wait for something. And I'm getting ready for it. Bella, I've been trying to call you but you never pick it up. No, I lost my phone. Sorry. There's an amazing offer on the table! Hollywood wants you! Hollywood? Me? Do you agree? If yes, all we need to do is sign. I'll need time to think. I'll call you back. -Bye. -Bella. You there! Waiters aren't allowed up here! You're an imposter. Security! What are you doing here? I just want to return your... They're slacking off. Wait up! He saved me today. This isn't a place for scrap. -Take this trash out! -Yes, sir. -Ben, was that necessary? -Yes. Now, can you please at least look as though you want to be here. I'm about to announce our wedding day! Our what?! Are you crazy? Hey! I'm sorry. If you ever try to get in again, I'll have your tyres punctured. Hey, listen up. Do you know who I am? I'm Wheely O'Wheels. Well, at least I did give it my best shot. Did you see her? Yes, and she said she's getting married. Congrats, Mr Wheely. You two look good together. Not to me. Then, to whom? Wait up, Mr Wheely. Don't you want to talk about this? No, thanks, Putt Putt. But I got to do some thinking. Solo. Keep eyes on the road and mind on the future. There's an old saying that goes,... ..."We shouldn't be stuck in the past." Because it's just going to make things worse. It's time. Sir, MIss Bella has just left. Who's there? Hello? Hello, Bella. Brad, you creeped me out. The party is back the other way. It's pretty dark in here. You shouldn't be alone. Maybe you and I could go for a drive? I don't need your company, Brad. I can go home on my own. You're beautiful, Bella. And I'm good looking. We're just made for each other. Everybody must be jealous of us. I have a friend who's desperate to get married. He's Ben! I think you two look good together. No, I'm not into something like that. Actually I've been waiting for the right girl. What are you waiting for? Push the red button! And the girl has got to be you, Bella. What's happening? Bella, wait up. Stop. I won't stop. What's happening? My tyre's gonna blow. What's going on? In 200 metres, take the first exit. What's happening here?! I'm going in reverse. What's happening, really? Don't tell me you can't hold it in, Brad. Watch Bella. Don't let her escape. Yes, sir. Anyone want some water? Car Wars? I've watched it too many times. It's getting boring. Hi, can I get your autograph? -You know me? -Of course, you're Wheely O'Wheels. I recognise your headlights. -Really? -Of course. And your registration number! This is so much fun! Thank you, see you around. Excuse me, can you budge a bit? I can't see the movie. You're Miss Di Monetti. What are you doing here? Just call me Bella. I'm watching the movie. You're funny, AND cute. I'm Wheely. Do you mind if I sit here? Of course, I won't mind if it's you. I'm trying to watch the movie. So, please, keep it down. I am your father. No, it can't be. Accept the fact, Roadrider. So what was it you wanted to speak to me about earlier? I just want to say sorry for ruining you photo shoot. And I want to return this to you. Oh, thank you so much. I've been looking for this everywhere. Hey, let's go grab a bite after the movie? But it's quite late now. It's not far. Good service guaranteed - the lady who runs the place likes me. You're blowing your own trumpet. Naughty. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go. Here we are. Bella, meet Momma. Momma, meet Bella. So, this is the lady who likes you? You should've called, Wheely. Nice to meet you, honey. Come on, let's get inside. Please. You have a lot of photos of Wheely. -My son always wins. -Oh, I see. I see. I don't follow sports much. Me neither, unless he's involved. So, Bella, are you two dating? Momma, we went to a movie. Your father and I went to a movie too. That's how it starts, son. Do I need to be thinking about ordering confetti? Well, we never know. We're just friends, Mrs. O'Wheely. I already have... ...a boyfriend. And he's a millionaire. But, money can't buy anything. Yes, sir. Miss Di Monetti is still inside the cafe with him. Cafe? Bring her back here now. Aren't those stars beautiful? Yes, they are. So how come you swapped racing for being a taxi? I was involved in an accident and got badly damaged. I don't even get to race anymore. I think it's all for the best. Racing is quite dangerous. Are you really that concerned about me? Of course, I don't want you to get hurt again. Because it would upset your mom. Oh my goodness. Excuse me. Just pretend that I'm not here. I've promised her that I'd never race again. Never. I will keep my promise. Bella, I have a question. Can we do this again? Sure, I do like a car who keeps his promise. I won't be so sure, honey. For you, I promise. Just trust me. I got a feeling that among all my promises,... ...this will be the one I remember the most. I won't disappoint you. Mr. Hub-Bonnet is waiting, Miss. Okay, I'm coming. See you again, Wheely. I hope. There's always hope, child! You come back anytime you like, hear? Bye, Mrs. O'Wheels. Keep him safe. Oh you just call me Momma, girl! I get inside first. I'm in love. Help me! Help! What did I tell you about being careful with the cars? On the count of 3! Three! Two... Yes, boss? I asked for an Italian! Not an American! Everyone knows Italians are worth more than Americans! We did what you said to do, Boss. The over-rider must be broken. The only thing that will be broken is you,.. ...if you don't fix this mess! I saw the over rider working perfectly... ...with my own eyes when I first tested it! The American's on the way boss, do you still want him? Send him over. You guys track that Italian down! Scratch that. You stay put and I'll track the Italian myself! What are you doing? Put me down! Drop him! Serves you right. Ben!? What are you doing here? -How did you get in here? -Honey. -Where have you gone? -I went out. I have my own life to live, Ben. My head is in a complete tangle. I don't know how to say this. I have thought of... Stop thinking too much, honey. I have taken care of everything. I have figured everything out. I really get you. -You get me? -Of course. I mean I get your idea of a honeymoon. I'll make sure it's the most romantic honeymoon ever. Honeymoon? I have never agreed to this! You have to. Can't you see just how good my tyres are? Even my body is all polished up. It's okay, Ben. It's getting late now. I'm exhausted and I need some rest. Darling, don't do this to me. Now, I want to know more about that piece of scrap. Am I not good enough for her? I can still hear you, Ben. So, what are you waiting for? Please make up your mind. It's Hollywood, Bella. It's everyone's dream. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Please give it some thoughts. Hey! I don't like heights! Keep it down! I want to squash you. I hate heights! I have rights! If you want to claim your rights, you can always go to the court. We've only got one spot left on Crank. I want the best for the last. I want the Italian. Hello, who's there? I have a message from Mr. Hub-Bonnet. A message? At this kind of hour? Mr. Hub-Bonnet requests your participation in a race through the streets. Just you and him. If you win, you'll get one million. What did you say? If you win, you'll get one million in cash. Mr Hub-Bonnet will explain the full details at the start line. Gasket City Tower, five A.M. Sorry, I'm retired. Why don't you just go. I need to sleep. One million in cash. I'm already retired. 1 million in cash. Now, why you gotta repeat 'cash' so many times?! Thank god, you're here, Putt Putt. You have got to help me. You can trust him, but still, be cautious. Yeah, I know. I can do loads of things with that 1 million reward. I need to repay Momma. Money for the cafe's repair and the bail. I can do many things with it. I might as well fix my backbone. Do not mistake temptation for opportunity, Mr. Wheely. There's no way you can beat him. He's got the power of six horses. Hold it, Putt Putt. Who says I've got to race? Nobody told me that I can't take any shortcuts. That's what I'm going to do. Here you are. You got some guts showing up here. We shall race from here to the Gasket City Tower. Winner takes all. You're just all talk. Can you really race? I might not be a racer but I always win. Enough talks. Just be ready to pay up. Wait, what happens if you win? Not that you will. If I win,... ...you can forget my girlfriend. He's threatening him. I don't feel good about this. Move it! You're blocking my way. Now, there's one good thing about being a taxi. We know shortcuts that others don't know. Almost there, Wheely. One million in cash. I win. I win. It's quite funny just how easy it is to win one million. Freeze! Don't move. Oh, no. It's the police. You again! You just don't learn your lesson, do you? I let you go... ...and next minute, you go and break the law big time again! I'm not the one at fault. It wasn't my idea to race. Someone challenged me for a race. Hello, Sergeant. It was me who called you... ...and inform you about this illegal racing event. Don't believe this peiece of scrap. What? You lie! You sent your man over to ask me for a race... ...and promised me a million in cash if I won. Ridiculous. Do I look like an illegal racer to you, Ma'am? I'm sorry, Sir. These young hooligans will say anything to avoid justice. Rest assured, Sir. You won't be seeing his face for a long time. Look at yourself in the mirror. You're one light year away from being like me. So, don't ever think of getting sympathy from Bella. Now, go rot in the prison. Enough of daydreaming. Move in reverse a little. Go! It's reckless wrecks like you that make this job worthwhile. You shouldn't have let him go. He's the mastermind behind all this. -It's all his fault. -Say that to your lawyer. -If you can afford one. -A lawyer? Yes, of course... I need to make a call. I'm entitled to one call, right? I have seen it in the movies. This isn't a movie, but a reality. Make it quick. Better call your mother. But this time, she won't be able to get you out so easily. -Hello. -Hello, Bella. It's Wheely. Oh, Wheely. What's up? Sorry, but I have something important to say to you. Are you alright? What's the matter? There was an illegal race. -I somehow got involved. -A race? Wheely, you've promised me. I need the money to help my mother. You did this for money after all of what we've discussed? Wheely, what happened? I thought you were different. But I was set up by Ben. I desperately need money to pay my Momma back. Enough is enough! Your friend has been arrested for taking part in illegal racing. And he was driving with broken side mirrors. -And he cried like a little baby. -Wait a second. Who's this? I'm Sergeant Street from Gasket City Police Station. Your friend here is an illegal racer. And he will be put behind bars for a long time! Move! Bella, what are waiting for? Please make up your mind. It's Hollywood, Bella. It's everyone's dream. It's once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Think it through. Next. Next. Why is it so hard to say which photo I look best in? Because I always look good. Ben, look. I want to talk to you. I think it's better for us to break up. Break up? Are you pulling my leg here? Darling, can't you see that I'm the right one for you? No, I'm going to Hollywood. I've been offered the lead role in a movie. But you can't even act! What?! That's not what I mean. I just can't live without you by my side. So, I don't want us to break up. You'll find someone else. It shouldn't be too hard for you. I know that deep-down you're a kind gentleman and all. There's nothing bad about you. But you're different. But we're not for each other. And we'll never be. Maybe not, but we can live a luxurious life together. But this isn't the life that I want. Ben, I don't love you. You're insane! Please just think this through! I am here for visit time. This is such a scary place. I guess I can get in. Move quickly. Stop looking around. You wouldn't have been here if you had took the left turn. This won't happen if you just listened to what I said. Here he is. -My best friend! -Putt Putt. I'm just so happy to see you here. Don't worry, Mr. Wheely. Two days from now, tomorrow will be yesterday. Everything is going to be fine. Yeah, right, Putt Putt. I'm just gonna be here for a long time. How did Momma take this? I think you have to apologize to her. -Daytime visit is now over. -Oh my goodness. Visiting hours for night visit is 6 to 8 pm. Don't worry Mr. Wheely, this is for you. A mix of chilli sauce, paraffin, and oil. Do you think you can do as you please in this prison? Give it to me! It's good. -Get out! -Alright. Go home! Stop making a fuss, will you? I'm right behind you. Turn around! I'm sorry, boss. Didn't know that you're already here. Are you sure it's an Italian car? We're not so sure, but I can ask her. Yes it is, boss. We're ready to reel her in any time you want, you say the word. Okay, I'm saying it now. Catch her. Momma. Anybody here? Bella, what are you doing here? I was passing by and I thought I'd drop by here. -Momma, are you okay? -I'm sure you know... ...where Wheely is at the moment. I knew that he would break his promise again. Why did he do it, Momma? Why did he race again? I know who he's like. We can't take out the racer out of a car like Wheely. -It's part of who he is. -I guess. Sorry for keeping you. I should get going. -I've a plane to catch. -Where are you going? I've got a job in Hollywood. I'll be away for a long time. Can you say goodbye to Wheely for me, Momma? I just can't face him right now. How could he do this to me? You can go, child. You go. Alright, Momma. Goodbye. Maybe there's time for one last goodbye? Drive twelve hundred meters to join main highway... There she is. Good! Target on the move. Destination detour. Miss Bella is good at driving backwards. Help! I take back my words! Bella, keep it all together. Stop stepping on the gas pedal! Please calm down! Calm down! Where does this truck come from? No! Hey, stop! Help! Anybody out there?! Help me! Such a grumpy face! Relax, they're just like me. Except for him. Him. What are they doing? What am I talking about? They're not even like me. They're a bunch of robbers, terrorists and they're dangerous. Hey! There are much more dangerous people out here. Do you see that guy over there? He used to be a politician. Never mind, let me just do my own thing in this cell. -Prisoner Wheely O'Wheels! -Yes. -You've got a visitor. -Who's coming to see me? Putt Putt? But he just visited me today. Momma? She's still mad at me. Maybe, it's Bella! Alright, Wheely. You're the man with the plan,... ...the King of the rims,... ...nobody is smoother,... ...you're the number one racer. Hi, sweety, I'm... -Putt Putt?! -Sweety? What are you doing here? Where's Bella? Miss Bella was driving backwards. Like this. She said she cannot control herself. And then she was screaming,"Help!" What are you saying? I think she's been car-napped? -Are you sure? -Yes, I really am. I saw it with my own eyes. I wasn't even blinking. Whatever I'm saying is she's been car-napped. She's car-napped? You've got to help me, Putt Putt. I have to get out of here. I have to find her. Do you know who took her? No, what I mean is do you see the culprit? Some mean-looking truck with Torque Town number plates. Torque Town? No way. This gets worse! You need to get me out of here. I don't come here alone. Putt Putt to control, do you read me? Control to Putt Putt! Yes! Are you done yet? -Why are you whispering to me? -Hurry up. Is Wheely okay? -We're screwed. -Wait, security guards. If we get caught, it's all over. Alright folks, playtime is over. Get back into your cells. Okay, let's do it tomorrow. They're gone, let's go. Get ready everyone. -Move! -Wait! Move faster! Don't get caught! Be aware of the lights. Are you sure about this plan, Putt Putt? No, but we can always try. Yeah, you're right. No way! I warned you about this so many times. Don't ever bring items for prisoners. So, I'm taking this. That tastes kind of weird! You like stay around, get girl, win races, have nice life? Of course, but why? Then, take cover now! And that's why you don't mix petrol with diesel! And kerosene, benzene, and water. What have you done here? Do you know how many offences you've committed? Under Section 72 Code 6B, underage trucks are not allowed to smoke! What have you got to say for yourself, young man? Ma'am! Attention all units! There has been a riot at Gasket City Prison! Requesting all units to backup! Congratulations, captain! You're the best! A prison riot! This is it! This is the time for Sergeant Street to shine! I'm coming! What a relief! Finally, I'm free. That's right, Mr. Wheely. We're as free as a firefly. Putt Putt, we're running out of time. We have to leave now. Don't waste time. Move! No, you're too big! You'd better tell me that you have a plan B. Plan B? There's no plan B! All other ways are closed. This is confusing. Not good! It's okay. Go save yourself first. Tell Momma that I love her so much. Putt Putt, you're like my own brother. Tell Bella that I... This is Wheely. I'm too slow. Freeze! Police! Where are they coming from? Don't run away! I hate heights! It hurts. Sounds painful, though. Guys, just follow me. They ran off into the tunnel. Wheely, I can't believe it! Your super jump was awesome! Thank you guys. I won't be here without your help. We should go now before they find us. -Where do you want to go? -Torque Town. I need to find Bella. And I'll make sure that no one follows you. Where am I? Start the scanner now! Time to check our new guest. What are you going to do to me? Move it! Engine, seventy thousand. Chassis, ninety thousand. Upholstery, thirty thousand. A CD, 'Fifty Greatest Love Songs', one dollar. That is not mine. I bought it for... Wait, are you done yet? Total profit of vehicle... One hundred and ninety thousand and one dollars Scan ended. Excuse me? Excellent! Take her to the holding area. And careful not to scratch the paint work! Don't you dare touch me. She's an invaluable vehicle. Feisty like a chilli! She's going to make us rich, boss! I just can't wait to be rich. But I think we will get double if we sell her piece by piece. How are going to find Bella in time? Nobody knows us in this town. So, why don't we hang out for a while bit. Let's call the police. Are you serious about calling the police? Are you crazy? We're on the wanted list! We got to keep on the down low. We're going underground! And we need disguises! Yes, disguises! He's a friend of yours?! Sure she is... Next you'll be telling me you're a racing car! How dare you insult me. How am I ever going to find Bella? We just two of us! Torque Town so big! It will take a thousand Wheely's to find Miss Bella. Hold on, that's it! You come up with the best ideas when you're not thinking, Putt Putt,... ...which is always. I know just the place to find a thousand Wheely's. Let me handle it. Hi, I want the number of every taxi office in Torque Town, please. Yes, you heard right. I knew it was a prank call. The joker that got us here is going to pay for this! No they won't. Get it? Hello, everyone. Speak, please. Hello, everyone! Are you the one who got us here? Yes, that's me. We should have him arrested! Now everyone, just chill. I called you all here because you are just like me. Ordinary people work as taxis... ...just to make a living. And I need your help. You'll need an ambulance when we're finished with you! An ambulance? I used to date an ambulance. It was a wreck from the start! No, please! I need help to find my girlfriend. Bella de Monetti is your girlfriend? He's crazy! He's out of his mind. Make way, please. Why us? Why not call the police? That's a long story. A jailbird, I should have known! I was framed. Please, guys. You're the eyes and ears of the street. Please help me out this time. And why should we get mixed up in some rich car business. What did they ever do for us? Tell me. They never tip! That's for sure! That's right! Ladies and gentlemen! We are gathered here as the Kings and Queens of the road... ...when have we ever judged anybody... ...by the gleam of their chrome... ...or their engine size? Shame on all of you! This is just a waste of time. We should feel proud of... Hey, where are you going? No... -Wheely. -Do I know you? The cinema, remember? Oh, yeah... You're the only one who's ever recognized me. Wheely, I don't know whether you're gonna trust me or not. Yesterday, I went to the docks. I saw... -And... -I think... And I think I saw your 'friend'... ...being loaded onto a rust-bucket ship called Crank. I wouldn't mess with those guys though. I heard stories that they're vicious. Bella's in danger! I have to save her no matter what. Can you bring me there? Yes, I can. I was about to head in that direction anyway. Wait! Putt Putt want to come along too! Putt Putt, stay put! But I want to tag along. Look, Putt Putt. It's going to be a dangerous mission. And I need to ride this one out without you. You've been the best buddy any car could have. And I don't want to lose you. This is going to be boring. Okay, here I go. Thanks for help me, Amy. Are you sure you're up for this? Remember once you're inside,... ...follow the yellow line to find Harbour Nine. I'll remember. Hey! Hit reverse, kid! This is a private property. Yeah, get out of here. Sorry, I had a call to drop off a delivery to Harbour Nine. This is Harbour Nine? What delivery? How would I know? I just make the delivery. It sounded urgent. Okay, you wait there. I'll go check. Don't go anywhere. What's the problem? Main gate here. Some taxi with Gasket City plates... ...with a delivery for Harbour Nine. What taxi? What delivery? What harbour? Taxi? Gasket City? That's Wheely! Tell him to shove off, he's got it wrong. Get him out of here. Can you keep the noise down? Some of us are trying to get our beauty sleep. Unbelievable! No delivery wanted here. I guess the address is wrong. I guess I should be off! Hey, where are you going? Calling all taxis in the harbour district,... ...there's a colleague in need of our help. You're going to get it! Over there. It's all your fault. I think I finally lost them. You need to stop moving! We're tired of playing catch! And you aren't going to be picking up any more fares! Don't you dare to refuse us. Come on, you are coming with us! Hold it, buddy! Nobody's gonna take my brother taxi anywhere. Says who? I see, you're not taking me seriously. Taxi! You called, Amy? If you creeps want my friend over there, you'll have to go through us first. You hear that Rumble! She wants us to go through her! With pleasure! Running away? Wheely, what are you doing here? Just go. We can't stay here for long. I'm on it! Thank you, Amy. That's it! Follow the yellow line to find Harbour Nine! What's this? It must be here somewhere. I guess there's only one way to find out. Oh, Mr Frank! Hey, aren't you the little bike with the broken race car? One year ago? What are you doing back here again? How's your friend doing? Putt Putt got no friend. Hashtag no friend. Hashtag lonely. Hashtag forever alone. Oh really? I thought you were that little bike with the friend who broke his axle. You're just wasting my time. But it's fine. I found a replacement part for him... -...if he ever wants it. -Mr. Wheely got no time. He's on a dangerous mission. His girlfriend got car-napped and Mr. Wheely gone to save her! Car-napped? I can guess who's behind this. There's only one truck who does that in Torque Town. I only have a piece of advice for you. I think your friend needs help. He's one mean trucker. But Mr. Wheely tell Putt Putt to stay put. What does it mean in English? Maybe Mr. Wheely needs my help! But I don't know which way to go. Mr. Frank, could you show me the way? Looks like we have a company. That cranky taxi doesn't worry me. But a good chance to check out the new security system. -Computer! -Ready to assist. Let's mix up the pieces a little, shall we? Randomizing... Why do I feel like someone's playing me like a video game? Is this your idea? This is a really bad idea. No such thing as a bad idea, Mr. Frank. Nothing nice will come from a rotten heart and an ugly face. But then, why did you ask him for help? Whatever you say. Now you go that way, and I'll go this way. Mr. Frank, are you not going to help me? Nope. Who's that? You're tying to trespass this property, right? Why do you even ask? Of course, they are. We should get a pay rise! I agree. In fact, double the pay rise. Now, get inside. Not you. Where are they taking us? I hate heights! Miss Bella, is that you? Sorry, if it's an autograph you want, you're out of luck. No, I'm Putt Putt. A friend of Mr. Wheely. I'm sure he tell you all about me? No. Is Wheely here? Is he trying to save me? I knew it! He was the taxi who showed up earlier. But where is he now? I don't know. But I know he's our only hope. Help! No! You need to do better than that if you're gonna stop Wheely O'Wheels! Okay, just you wait. Computer, give me manual override. Affirmative! Manual override initiated... This is no good. We have to get out of here... ...before we get chopped up like the rest. That's not going to happen. Mr. Frank, can you try? I can try. Ouch. Face it! You and me, we're not in the same league! Don't ever dream that Bella would want anything to do with the likes of you! Go back to your warehouse. Stop daydreaming! Oh, yeah! We'll see about that! Listen up, Wheely. You have the speed, the strength, even with a junky axle. You have the will. That was a smashing success! I made it! Great plan. Stay focused, Wheely. Yeah, I can do it, I'm the man. Just a little bit more. Don't try this at home, kids! Who's the man! I'm the man, alright! Thank you. Did anyone see that? Again? Come and catch me! Now's about the time when the hero's got to drive away real slow,... ...with a cool face,... ...while everything comes crumbling down behind him in slow motion. No explosions? Really? Later, Torque Town. You aren't going nowhere with Bella! Oh, no... You might have been tricky to find... ...but justice always win in the end. Clamp him. Wait! You're making a big mistake. I'm not the one who should be arrested. It's them! That gang of law breaking,... ...violent car-nappers! You have a very vivid imagination. Car-nappers? Stop in the name of the law! It's the cops! Crank it up, on the double! Okay, boss. I'm moving at full speed. Thanks to the police... ...that cranky taxi won't be able to chase us. Putt Putt, what are we gonna do now? Focus on the ramp, not the water! Water? Where? One, two, three! Jump! We made it! We're still alive. But where is Miss Bella? She's still up there. She's too scared to jump. Bella! Mr. Wheely, we're sorry. We tried our best. -Did you meet her? -Yes, she's still on board. Please Sergeant Street, let me go. I'm begging me. I've got to save her. I can't afford to lose her. Bella. Wheely. -Officer! -Ma'am? Swing? Swing? Swing! -That's an order! -Yes, Ma'am! Faster! What are you doing, Officer? It's Sergeant! Wheely. Now, swing! Go get him for me! Water? Anything but water. Anything but water! Boss, did you order a taxi? What? Wheely! Crank, full speed ahead! Now! Yes, sir. I'm not gonna make it. Bella, hold on! I'm coming! Why didn’t' anyone tell me how fun flying was? That was an amazing landing! Of course, I'm a racer. Bella! Look out! Help! Wheely. Wait! I'm coming. This ship is for first class only! I won't let you pass. Move out of the way! Wheely! Bella! There's no way that you can save her. You'll pay for this, you crook! This really is too easy to be any fun. We'll both go down together! This can't be... It's hot! Hot! So, this is the famous Kaiser. King of the car-nappers! And the crowning glory of my career! Okay, boys, clamp him! Give us your full cooperation. Slap my face! Why do you do that? You just asked for it. That's the motivational quote in my school. I can say it whenever I want. But what about Wheely and Bella? They went for a swim... ...to the bottom of the ocean! Take him away! Move! Don't worry. We'll dredge the sea bed until we find them. Look! The scenery is great here. That's the ship. The ship is still afloat. Wheely. You promise to tell the cops I'm the one who helped save you. Remember it was Crank who stopped you falling into the water. But I'm not so sure about the other one. Wheely... Hopefully, he's alright. Wheely, can you hear me? Open your eyes. You shouldn't have come here to save me. This is all my fault. Please wake up. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you, too. What? Wheely! Ouch! Bella, I thought you were dead? Are we dead? Am I in heaven? But why's there fire? Wheely! I was about to fall over,... Now we are at the first race of this new street race season,... ...which sees the return of Wheely O'Wheels in his fresh looks! Look at that gleaming yellow and black! He's a taxi. Yes, I know. And he'll be competing again with his old foe Jay Lo. That's Joe Flow. Sorry for my co-commentator's slip of the tongue. Well, that's alright. -No one's perfect. -Good thing that you know that. Back to the race now and Jay Lo,... ...I mean Joe Flow, has hit the front! I have fixed him. So, he'd better win this race. He's good, Momma. He's always good whether he wins or not. I second that, Momma. It was so good of you to come just for this race, Bella. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Besides, I have some time off before my next movie. Faster, honey! Show them what you've got, son. Did you hear what she just said? Of course, I can hear that! -She did say it. -I heard what she said. So, you say you know Wheely, Madam Officer? It's Captain! That racer taxi foiled a global car-napping ring! We all should be grateful! I want you to become like Wheely O' Wheels immediately. Good to have you back on the track, Wheely. I see you're now racing in your taxi colours. As my Momma says, it isn't about what's on the outside,... ...it's the inside that counts. You mean you like my new leather interiors? That's not what I really meant. That's enough, I just prefer black and white checks.
