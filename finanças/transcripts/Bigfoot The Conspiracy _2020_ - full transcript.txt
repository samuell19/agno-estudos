(insects chirping) my friend Annabelle at Camp Jewel told me - So finish the story. - Okay. So he's a evil kind of critter that shuffles around town and they call him the- - Oh, the Chupacabra. - No. - Dogman, it's the Dogman. - No. Anyone else? They call him the- - Oh, Mothman. - No. He's the Hogback. And he'll getcha! If you don't watch out. People know he's evil. - Why do they call him the Hogback? - By the way he shuffles around. Has this evil look in his eye. He carries a knife, or pitchfork. Children swear he's crazy. - Hell no. (people chattering) (Bigfoot snorting) - [Boy] Where do you come up with this stuff anyway? - [Girl] Hey, did anyone else notice the crickets stopped chirping? - [Girl] Yeah, I wonder if it has anything to do with that skunk. Weird. (insects chirping) - Danny. Danny. - What? - It's this one. - Toss it away. That's no Psilocybin. Get back to work. And don't be nibbling on any. I don't need you tripping out here.

I've been out there a couple of times, haven't seen nothing, but you're welcome to go take a look. - Yeah. I'll do that for sure. And what's up with the tree down along the driveway there? What happened? I don't know, it came down last night. No idea what caused it. I mean, we didn't have any bad weather. Thank you, Mom. - Thank you so much. - Well, I don't know what's going on out there, but it ain't no coyotes howling in the middle of the night like that.

And it's loud enough that I can hear it over your dad's snoring. - Why haven't you said anything about this before? - I know you didn't want me to worry. Well, I'll leave you boys to it.

I didn't realize there was so much to it. - Then you're not paying close enough attention. - Okay. - What are you, like, military? - No. - You look like it. - I was a border patrol agent. - Wow. Okay, so what, did you get out? - I got injured. - You don't look injured. - Thanks. I'll take that as a compliment. It was nice talking with you. - You too. Hey, Dante. Watch out for Wood-booger, (birds chirping) (Bigfoot growling) (eerie music) - Okay, Sam, in your own words, can you tell me about your experiences with Bigfoot? - Well, my Bigfoot experiences since 1983 have been quite unintentional. I started going trout fishing, camping, and hiking in the North Georgia mountains. And since then, I've had them talking outside my tent at night, throwing rocks, screaming, whistling, and I can't seem to get away from them, practically, when I take these trips up there. And I've often wondered why this happens, and I think they're intuitive to the people that come up there, whether they're, you know, troublemakers or they're rather cool. And up until a couple years ago, I thought they were just like some kind of a caveman-ape hybrid. But a couple years ago, at night while camping, I saw a white orb that was in the same general area where I had some Bigfoot activity, and I believe they are what they call the Nephilim, which is in Genesis 6:4 in the Bible. - Interesting, yeah, Nephilim, I've actually heard of that before. - Well, the Nephilim were supposed to be a hybrid between the sons of God, which some interpret as the fallen angels, with human women that created a race of giants. The one most people are familiar with is Goliath from David and Goliath. And I believe these Bigfoots are direct descendant or at least related to that group of giants. This opinion is not very popular, but after 36 years in the field, that's the one I have. - Wow, yeah, that's very interesting. Thank you so much for that interview. - You're welcome. (birds chirping) - Mind if I sit down? - Yeah, go ahead. - Nice day, huh? - It is. - You don't recognize me? - You remind me of someone. - It's me, Landon. Steve Garrett's son? - Oh, wow. All grown up. Almost. - [Landon] Yeah. - Your father was a great border patrol agent, and a great man. - Thank you, sir. He thought the world of you. Telling me some crazy stories about you guys when I was little. - Yeah. Yeah, we had some fun. He died protecting his country. - Yeah. He wouldn't have had it any other way. - Yeah. So what's up, Landon? You look like you have something on your mind. - Well... My mom thinks that I crunch numbers for the IRS, right? But actually, I'm assigned to the Pentagon's advanced threat identification team. - Wow. What the hell is that? - It's complicated. - Wait, secret agent Landon Garrett? - I'm actually an intel analyst. I was over at MIT. They recruited me. - Impressive. - Listen, you're on our radar. - What's going on, Landon? - Look, I shouldn't be telling you this, but we run surveillance on anybody poking around that area, and when your vehicle registration popped up, I almost... - So it's true, then. - Is what true? - The government covers up the existence of certain creatures. - What do you mean? - Well, I saw something on a trail cam, there's these government restricted area signs popping up everywhere, and now you're telling me that there's a sneaky government agency that's pulling surveillance in that same area? - I see your point, sir, but you should really stay out of that area. - Landon, I really appreciate you reaching out to me. But Brooke's parents live up there. Livestock and wildlife are disappearing. I mean, what's next, them? Can Uncle Sam guarantee their safety? Don't answer that, we both know the answer. - With all due respect, sir, this isn't dope smugglers. Okay, there's something out there that we do not fully understand. Just don't go out there. - Okay. - Okay. Really? - Absolutely. - What are you doing with your gear? - I'm just gonna hike around up at your parents' place. - Are you camping overnight? - Well, yeah. I need to hike out far enough to set up the bait stations to where they're not drawing the predator in towards the livestock. - That sounds dangerous. - Danger's my middle name. - Oh, God. I'll come with you. - No, Brooke, please. Not this trip. I'll be gone one night, two max. All right, stay with your parents, you have fun. (tense music) - Miss Thomas? - Agent Cortez. - We're at a critical point in this op. Every move we make is crucial. - Yes sir, I agree. - Good. We're pulling all surveillance equipment. - Sir? (Cortez sighs) - As you know, Intel suggests that our subject may or may not be able to detect the infrared light from our cameras. I believe he's avoiding them completely. This could provoke him to leave the area, and we will not have any more sightings. - So how will we monitor the situation? This just seems counter-intuitive to our mission. - Stay in your lane, Thomas. You're an analyst. Don't overanalyze. - Right. - This thing's like a wet fish. Every time we tighten our grip, it slips right through our fingertips. I'll have Smith and Hutchins and my disposal, outside of that, I want everyone out of the AO and awaiting further orders. Is that understood? - Yes, sir. - Good. (birds chirping) Hey Dad - Good morning. - Morning. - Well, you're all ready to go. - Yes, sir. I'm going to hike out a ways while there's still plenty of daylight. - You're really gonna camp out there? - Yeah, for sure. And I'll get that tree cleaned up when I get back. - Don't worry about that. You just take care of yourself. - [Dante] Yes, ma'am. - You going with him? - Oh, no. I thought I'd spend some time with you guys. - Oh, great. - You're not moving in, are ya? - No. - Would you like to join us for breakfast? - Oh, that sounds amazing. But I better pass. I got a long way. - Your loss. - I'm sure. - You're a jerk. - Love you too. Be safe out there. Yes sir. - So Denise, you said you had this experience when you were a child? - Yes. I was probably about 12 or 13. My parents rented a cabin up in Unicoi State Park in North Georgia. My dad and brother and I decided to go hiking near the river. At some point, I decided to go ahead of my dad and my little brother. At that point, I felt as if someone was watching me, someone was with me. The first thing I do is look to my left, where the river is, and I don't see anything. There's all trees on my right, when I go and look to my right, the trees are staggered in and out. Something comes out of the trees. It's tall, it's on two legs. It's got long, black, stringy hair, and it takes one step. As I turn and look at it, it looks at me and takes another step. I turn and take off running. I run all the way back to the cabin, go upstairs in the loft, hide. My mother asked, "What's wrong?" I screamed to her, "There's a monster, there's a monster." - Wow. And did this change your perception of reality at all? - Yes. I was never afraid of a monster under my bed before. - Very interesting. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. (upbeat ringtone music) - Sup, Judith. - I met with Cortez. They're pulling all the surveillance equipment. - Yeah, I could see that. Why? - The infrared lights on the cameras. - I get that. We discussed that possibility in the past, but why now? I thought we were surveilling the people, not the creature. - I don't know. He wants us out of the area to await further instruction. - Really? - Yeah. Just stay in touch? I'm gonna lay low for a while. I suggest you do the same. - Roger that. - And Garrett? - [Landon] Yeah? - Take off that hat. You look ridiculous. - What else have you seen? - Gotta go. - World famous.

Kershaw. - Cortez. - Aren't you gonna offer us a cup of coffee there, Johnny? - Cute place. - Sometimes you get what you get. So, to what do I owe the pleasure, gentlemen? - They want this thing for bio-molecular testing. - What? Who's they? - We received some intel from our asset within the black market pharmaceutical industry. They do some very disturbing cross-genome experiments. They want to combine Bigfoot DNA with human DNA. We believe they want to create some kind of a hybrid that they can use as a weapon. - Really. - The only thing they need now is the creature. That thing is worth a ridiculous amount of money to them. - We, on the other hand, cannot allow that to happen. - Agent Cortez, we believe that your unit is compromised. - No way. We may be young, but we are not- - We need to dry clean your whole operation. Pack a bag. We're flying back to the puzzle palace for briefing. - Wheels up in 40. - It's kind of a bad time, sir. - Isn't it always?

This is my world. You live in the shadows, I am the shadows. Don't ask me any more questions. - Yes, sir. - We have a leak. Talk to no one. (camera beeps) - Okay. Mr. Ravish. Camera's rolling. Go ahead. - Well, I'd say it was about almost a year ago now. I saw this bright light hovering over my pasture. It was just there for a few seconds, then it was gone. I started to walk out there. About halfway across the pasture, there I saw it, standing in the tree line. - What was it? - Well, it was a seven, eight foot tall hairy man, looking right at me, Before I could raise my shotgun, it was gone. - Holy shit. - That's what I said. - It just ran away? - I didn't see it runaway. It was just gone. - Do you think it was an alien? - I didn't say that. - Well, I mean, I just thought, you know, maybe because you thought you saw a UFO, and you basically described seeing Bigfoot, maybe there was like a correlation between the two. - Those are your words, not mine. I just know what I saw. (phone buzzes) - [Both] Shit's getting crazy. - You know about Driskell and Kershaw? - No, what happened? - They were found in Cortez's crash pad, dead from lead poisoning. - Are you kidding me? Kershaw recruited me. He's like a father to me. - Yeah, he was one of the good ones. - No way, Cortez? Yeah. - He's been bought and paid for by a black market pharmaceutical company that wants big foot DNA to do some crazy shit. Wait, what were you gonna say? - Nothing. - Don't do me like that, Garrett. - Judith, listen. An old friend of my dad's from the border patrol went down to the restricted area to hunt the creature. Okay? He said he saw one in one of his trail cameras and he thought maybe it was the reason why his livestock was disappearing. I tried to convince him to stay away. Yeah, now Cortez knows he's out there. - This is not good. - No, it's not. - I'm due back in DC. You stay alive. - Shit, this can't be good. (phone buzzing) Hey. - [Landon] Where are you? - Just tracked this thing to the edge of the woods. It's going into like an old warehouse. - Jesus. Listen, our lead agent Cortez is corrupt, and lethal. He knows you're out there. - [Dante] Corrupt, what do you mean, how? - If I say another word, I'm gonna end up in a roadside ditch, just... Knowing him, he's probably tracking your phone right now, which means you're leading him right to it. - Shit. Roger, that - [Landon] Careful... - Did you get your haircut? - Mm-hmm. I needed to get a little cut off, do you like it? - It looks nice. - And what's new with you? - Not much. Work's starting to pick back up. - That's good. Are you okay? You've been acting a little distracted. - Yeah, I don't know. Dante's been acting a little weird lately. (phone buzzing) - Speak of the devil. (phone line ringing) Hey. - Brooke, listen, I need you to get your parents and get out of the house. - What? - Just do it, promise me. (gunshot bangs) - Somebody's here. (gunshot bangs) - Shit. (door slams open) - Brooke. Mr and Mrs. Jensen. We're just here to talk for a minute. - It's clear. - Shit. (man sighs) (engine rumbling) (engine stops) - Is that all he said? - Yeah, basically. - I knew this was some next level shit. - Mom. - Will you two please calm down? - Hey. Don't worry. Dante can handle anything out there. - Oh. Bigfoot. You really do smell like death. (coughs) (Bigfoot breathing heavily) (Bigfoot growling) - Thanks for the fish. I know you only came out here to protect your family. You need to get back into the woods. You probably don't understand a word I'm saying. - [Cortez] Dante! I'm coming for you! (gunshot bangs) - Oh shit. You shot at one of our own. - Yeah? Well he's a POS. Just a warning shot anyway. - You know warning shots are against policy. - Really? That's what you're worried about? (gunshots banging) (Bigfoot breathing heavily) - Well done. This thing's bigger than you and me, Dante. - Yeah, I know. I saw it. It's massive. - That's not what I meant. - I know what you meant. - That's funny. Hell of a thing, hunting a beast like this, huh? - Not really. (gunshot bangs) - You okay? - I'm good to go. Who are you? - I'm Agent Hutchins. This is Smith. - Cortez was our boss. - Before he crossed the line. - What line is that? - In this business, it's gray sometimes. - But he crossed it. (sirens wailing) - I'll take the heat. - No way. You need to get outta here. You never saw us. We never met you. (eerie loud growl) (Bigfoot growling) - Okay. That just happened. - I didn't see anything. - Me either. (eerie distant howl) (Bigfoot growling) - No no no no no. Shit. Shit. (insects chirping) - Little on the small side, don't you think, Carl? - Yeah, I don't think we'll get much more than 30 bucks for these scrawny suckers. - You know, we're running out of critters to poach around here. - Yeah, Barlow, we might have to get ourselves an honest job. (both laughing) (man shushing) What is it with you and tomatoes? - You ain't heard? - No. Full of Lycopene What is that? - It's essential to prostate health. - You think I'm gonna give you a prostate exam, you out your damn mind. Let's go get these goats. (Bigfoot breathing heavily) (Bigfoot roaring) (eerie distant howl) (Distant Bigfoot growling) - Hey Pops. Is that the hairy man? - You better believe it.
