You have to think about it carefully. Got it? You don't understand? You don't, do you? Okay, okay. Alright, then! Let's do it tomorrow in more detail. And let's think about the next part after tomorrow, okay? You! Where are you going? I have an appointment with friends at 4:00. Yoshimi! Why doesn't she listen to me? How annoying! Since you told me that you liked this, I went to Yokohama to buy it. - What's wrong? - I love you. No. I know, in your heart, you actually want to hug me. I'll scream very loudly. Going home? Wait! I will walk you up to the station. I have something to buy. I'm so grateful that you'll come again tomorrow. Otherwise, Yoshimi would go out with friends again. She is like her mother. She is naughty and stubborn. You're the one who's naughty. Well, don't tease me anymore. - Let's go. - Tutor... - Wow, this place feels awful. - Awful? Haven't heard the news recently? The serial murders. Well, considering the appearance, I must say it does make sense. I don't like it. I want to go somewhere else. What's wrong? If I became a victim of that sort... What sort? If I got something like light bulbs shoved into... Into where? You know where! Do you have to ask? Where? Tell me! - There... - And then? I get stomped hard on my stomach... You're not talking about a stomach. It's your vagina. That's right. I get stomped there. It finally breaks... And the blood starts pouring down from there... Alright! I will put mine inside. No! Please! No! No! No! Stop! I can't do it! Please stop! No! Stop! Please! What are you thinking about? Hmm... You're comparing my body to the body of someone you love, aren't you? Don't be silly. You're such a mean person. Who do you think would come to that awful place every day? I couldn't help thinking about seeing you again. Please... Rape me again right now! I love you. I want to blow you. Somebody is here. Look! Somebody's here. - Nobody found out, right? - You're so tacky. That's why I told you that it would be better to meet up at a love hotel. Don't be ridiculous. Come this way. Mr. Manager, hurry up. We don't have time. It hurts. It hurts bad! Do some foreplay please. I have to go to the Mitaka branch soon. It hurts... - Have you groomed your nails? - Sorry. Having fun yourself only? Strangle me. Grab my neck. Do it hard like this. I can't do that. No way... If you don't do it, I can't feel anything. Hurry. More. Full power, with both hands. Don't stop. It just started feeling good... More... More... Enough? Please marry me, Yomoto. You can come any time since everything is prepared. The land and my mountain need much help at the moment. I can buy any house. So... Yomoto! Yomoto! Do you think he saw us? No, if he saw us, he wouldn't have left like that. - I'll go home. - Want me to walk you? No. Hello. It's your father. Want to have a dinner? Good. Be a nice girl there, Yoshimi. Yes. Didn't you say you would come back tomorrow? Client's ticket has been cancelled. - I'll prepare dinner right away. - It's okay. I've already eaten. I see. I'll prepare some tea then. Tomoko... You don't like Yoshimi? No way... Darling... In that case, why does she always stay at Obaru's house? You know that the reason why I took you as my wife... is that I thought you would have a good relationship with her. You should keep that in mind. Otherwise, this won't work. You're a bit heavy today, Kentaro. I will get off then. Feels good. I want to do this stuff with you at a foreign hotel. Yeah, me too. I've had enough with Guam and Hawaii already. Whatever. I would go wherever. Have you heard of the Udai Pool in India? A night on the canopy bed on which Jacqueline Kennedy and... Elizabeth Taylor slept costs only 4,000 yen. Well, the trip doesn't seem that promising. You slept with the lady from the house where you are tutoring yesterday, right? Why don't you try to understand my feelings more? You're the one who has to understand. You've been with the owner of the caf√©, haven't you? You went there together, right? I feel tired. Sorry, can you get off? Then I won't do it today. You, pervert! Don't be ridiculous! What's with the racket? I can't sleep! Sorry. A housewife was watching! Grotesque Serial Murders... Young couple... Hey! I said one more. Sorry. You seem a bit off today. You still don't get it right, even though I told you last night. - Here. - No need. I'm going to school soon anyway. - Yoshimi, let's go. - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you alone? - You don't have to ask. I think he saw me that time. Impossible! What's wrong with you this early? The more I think about it, the more scared I become. Good morning. Do something with the kid. Look! I'm the only one who's dealing with it. Why don't you call someone? I will call. Mr. Manager, you are too easy on people. Pull it together please... It's 1,873 yen. Welcome to our shop! - What is it? - Toilet. Annoying kid. Kentaro... It's not the right time! That murderer is the manager of the supermarket in front of the station. I think he knows we saw his face. How?! The way he stared at me in the supermarket. That stare shows he knows it. Definitely. What?! What should we do now? Since we know the murderer, we can contact the police. The police? No! Why not? We might get killed too otherwise. But... it's still not clear whether he is the real murderer or not. You're totally overwhelmed, aren't you? He is the one. No doubt about it. He saw me again. But it seems he doesn't care about me at all. I'm scared. Why are you skipping the police station now that we're finally there? But... I will be in trouble if someone asks why I was there at that time. Right, you've been worried about that. Of course. I see. I'll go by myself. I'll do it without mentioning you. The police aren't that naive. You'll never make it. Please don't go. I beg you. You can't do it tonight, Kentaro? Don't want to do it like before, Kentaro? Ah, that hurts, stupid! I'm thinking about the murderer. I'm a witness to a rape-murder. Good night. - Wait. - Yes. Tomorrow I have to deliver some work at the embassy. Please do it for me. Yes. Come here. But... I haven't yet... It's okay. Just come. I'm tired tonight. You're young. It's fine. Tomoko, you've become a good housewife recently. I feel relieved now. The body was found here. We've prepared a photo of this place. This place is called "Boat Graveyard". Disposed-of boats have accumulated there. This beautiful woman is a 22-years-old employee of the City Office. Her name is Rika Murakami. Her dead body was found there. You're going to the police? Not at all. Even if everybody envies having an affair with a married woman... it's not something to be revealed in public. Maybe. I guess many people must envy you so much though. What? How about getting some hush money from her? Promising her that you're not going to sue her? Are you kidding?! Let's go to India together with that money. Why? You're concerned about her, right? No way! I'm afraid of the murderer! Alright! Alright! I'm just trying to have a conversation. What are you doing? I want to see the scene myself. Feel the thrill. Are you stupid? We can't go there anymore! Help me! Please help me! Please! Do you want money? Please help me! Your body is corrupted. I will purify it for you. Poor thing. This is the scene. Fumio, you brought company. - Hey! - What? He is the one? No doubt about it? Yes, that man was the murderer. I think I'm going to report to the police. I decided last night. Kentaro! What are you talking about? No! Never! What if the two of us are mentioned in the newspaper? That's great. We can earn money from the TV station. What? We might use that money for the trip. Don't be ridiculous! Hello... Huh?! The reason why I decided that? Yes, the reason. The reason is that I don't want to die. He is a perverted murderer. No way! It's not possible! Actually I have seen the scene myself last night. You must be tired. That's why you're talking like that. Wait, don't hang up! Don't hang up until I say so. Come to my house then. It's empty tonight because my husband's going to his mother's place with Yoshimi. Then I'll go to your place. Let's find a good solution. Just don't report to the police. Who... who are you? How... Miss... Don't come near me! Miss! Why did you follow me? Tell me! You've come to see me several times, even using your car! Why? Go away! Go away! - Get out! - Go away! Don't kill me... Don't kill me like that person... You saw it, right? If you talk to the police, I will tell everyone about this. Hey, don't force the woman to extremes. You just tell the truth for justice. - You're an evil woman, aren't you? - Of course. - I don't care, so long as I get the money for the trip. - I got it, okay? Actually, I can't forgive her for getting between you and me. Ugly bitch! I'm kidding. If you don't come back in a few hours, I will go to the police, got it? Yeah! Sorry for having an affair! Don't be ridiculous! I'll come after work. Have a nice trip. Be careful. Yoshimi, be nicer to your mother. Why? I can't do anything by myself. And you can't even get a lunchbox for yourself when the school cafeteria's closed. The room looks good. I lived alone in a small studio with bad lighting before I got married. Can I sit? Well, I'm impressed that you have enough things for living alone. Tomoko! What? What's with that scary look on your face? - Let's go to the police together. - What? As low as I am, I still feel responsible. Kentaro! You're not a kid. You know what will happen. I can't mess up my life! It's just that our affair will be revealed. If everybody knows about it, I'll be kicked out of my house. My husband might be fired from his company. You mean you don't care about me at all. What if I get killed by the perverted killer? When we were driving by him, he saw me too. Please... My husband has a stubborn character. And Yoshimi always acts like she wants to run away from home. However, I still depend on him. I got it. Can you pay me? The hush money, so to speak. - Kentaro! - Why are you staring at me like that? You told me you loved me. Was it a lie? You even told me so two nights ago! - While having sex... - Stop! How much do you need? OK, then. 500,000 will do. No, 700,000. 700,000? Impossible! If you can't pay, that's not my business. What do we do? Let's go to my house. I'll give you the bank card in my name. What is it? Hug me. I think the only one I love is you. Your body is young. You are not trying to trick me, are you? 700,000. No way. I feel sad that you say that. I don't care if this is the last time. Please do me. I love you... Miss... We are corrupted people. That's right. Our lives are very colorful! Dear Building Manager: Kentaro Omori was tricked and killed by Tomoko Ukai. I, Maya, am going out to get the evidence. The End
