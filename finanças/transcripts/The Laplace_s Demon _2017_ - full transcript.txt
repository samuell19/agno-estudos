You can't imagine the effort. Finding those rare pieces... If you think some were specially made for the Army. Yet I managed. Anyway, back to the story. I was testing my freshly assembled transceiver on low frequencies, when, believe it or not, I picked up this S.0.S. Just to be sure I called the Port Authorities and just think what they said, Sophia. They'd lost contact with the boat more than half an hour ago and they asked me to link across. Would you believe that they're still grateful? Of course Bruno, you saved them. Well anyone would have done it. But you need to stay cool managing two frequencies at the same time. Karl, the program's working well. Captain! Are we going to be on time? I hope so. I want to get back before the weather changes. It doesn't look so threatening. At sea things can change in a few minutes. Funny that a scientist like you doesn't know that. Here we go again. They think were scientists. Well we do work in science and don't forget Karl has a degree in Physics. Right, and a Masters in Applied Presumption. I just think he's a big head. Look at him, Mr. Perfection going over yesterday's test to pick out our faults. I bet he'll blame one of us. What do you mean, Bruno? The test went off well. Not for Karl. For him that minimum 2% of error is intolerable. You'll see, he'll make us go over it all again. I don't think so. Isaac's pleased and remember he's the boss. You'll see Sophia, we'll have to go over it. What do you say Roy? Do we have to talk about work? You're right. That's enough or we'll end up like someone else we know. What do you think, Herbert? Do you know Karl has spent his last months' salaries on crystal glasses? What Jim Bob? Is this another of your inventions? He fold me himself. Karl, how many glasses have you broken this month? This westerly always blows up before a storm. Look at the color on the horizon. It isn't good. You know, my job involves forecasts too. For example Mr... Alfred. Alfred, have you thought if it's possible to estimate how many pieces a glass can break into? Why on earth should I? With a minimum error my team and I can do it. We are working on a software that can calculate how different materials perform such as glass, under particular physical conditions. See Alfred? You estimate atmospheric conditions we, the physical ones. To a certain extent we're colleagues, aren't we? Can you see that big rock over there? We call it the "Rook's Nest". That's just where we are heading for. It's an island. Hasn't your Prof. Cornelius ever told you he lives like a hermit? Actually we've never met him. He sent us an invitation. I wouldn't want to be his milkman. Tell us something about him. He only communicates by mail. I just deliver his supplies. Unload and vanish. That place gives me the shivers. He's rather reserved this Comelius.. Those who sail these waters call him "The Crazy Scientist". Let me get this straight, Alfred. You're not thinking of dumping us there? I'm not staying in that place... give me a signature and I'm off. How you get back is none of my business. Look at that fool. He thinks he's a tourist. Hey genius, don't use your flash in daylight. - That's what you say. My grandad said the flash... - Jim Bob! Put away the camera. We're here to work. There's an opening down there. That's the entrance, isn't it Alfred? Can you see another one? You're a chum Alfred. Herbert, show us the way. One moment, Doctor! Sign it here and I'll be off. Hold on Isaac. What's that paper? - Proof of delivery - Did we hire you? - No, but so what? - Then Prof. Cornelius will sign. - It looks like a mine. - It reminds me of "Joumey to the Centre of the Earth". Herbert, don't you suffer from claustrophobia? Odd, I was sure It was you. Prof. Cornelius certainly doesn't. How can you live in a place like this? I'm curious to meet him. Who knows what he's like? It's a mystery. Not even the captain, Alfred, has ever met him. Really? Yet he's been delivering goods to him for ages. But are we sure this Cornelius really exists? All we can do is go up and see. How do you think it works? Maybe we should turn the key? Let's try. That's odd, it works with a spring. It won't turn any further. - Here we are. - What luxury! Jim Bob, control yourself. No one here to meet us?! Anyone home?! Are you all asleep?! Please, Alfred... Now listen here. You're not in a hurry, but I want to leave before the storm starts. - What a charming room. - No one here either. We could wait here. This room is strange. I can't get its shape. I was thinking that too. What a view. You can even see the sea. What's that TV doing in the fireplace? This Cornelius is really off-key. Anyone for a Brandy? What are you doing? This isn't your house. No, but ''m a guest. - I have no signal on my phone. - We're in the middle of the sea. Like this. It's just a decoration. And this? - Doesn't it look familiar? -No, not at all. Of course! It's an exact copy of this mansion. You're right. It's the same shape. A perfect miniature. It's a masterpiece... The Professor must really love his place. Yes, "Home Sweet Home". Look Bruno, there's the hall we came through. There's the corridor we've just come down and that's where we are now and... and that? Hey Karl, come and have a look! We're in it too. What do you mean Jim Bob? There are eight pawns in the model. And there are eight of us... Six pawns in front of the model. Another on the other side and that could be Karl sitting on the sofa. And the last one alone over there. Near the window. Look, it's moving! What spooky stuff is this? Karl, come here! Look at his pawn: it's moving in real time. Let me try! But that's me. Whoever is shifting the pawns is surely watching us. I told you the place was damned. There's no hidden camera here. Don't think we're being watched. I have found this for you, Isaac. Good evening and welcome. This is Professor Cornelius speaking. At the moment I'm not home, not because I'm rude but it's part of the experiment to which you've been invited. The field of research is the same you've been working on for a long time: the possibility to estimate physical events. I'm aware of your research and congratulations on your results. Remember you've just started your climb up a long ladder, I believe I have already reached the top. At the moment I can say no more or the experiment could be affected. I forgot to tell you... The lift you used to reach my home is also the only way to leave. From this moment on it will be blocked until dawn So, be prepared to spend the night here. Make yourselves at home. Good bye. What's this cad talking about? He can't be serious. He won't have blocked the lift! And what experiment is he talking about? He mentioned an experiment in his letter but I thought he was referring to ours, not his. Isaac, I don't like this Cornelius. He doesn't even let us see his face. It could just be some bored scientist's joke. You must admit this is all disturbing. Maybe we've been kidnapped. Dear Herbert, things are looking bad. The lift isn't working. The door's sealed and it can't be opened. - Have you checked it carefully? - It's an armored door. So? We have to stay here until tomorrow morning? Seems so. What? I have to go to work, I don't have time to waste with people like you! Calm down Alfred. You're not the only one who's worried. Take a cognac... What a mess. The situation needs to be analyzed with a clear mind. We can't waver in front of what seems inexplicable. You're referring to the model, aren't you Karl? What you are simply calling the model, is still copying our movements in the mansion without making a mistake. You think there's a manipulator, but there isn't anyone. How can you be so sure? Hold on Karl. Are you saying the model or whatever you want to call it, is moving independently? Not independently, but automatically. It's a mechanical device. Like a highly sophisticated musical box. What are you saying? A musical box? Every movement is already planned in the mechanism. What you're saying is that who built this toy could forecast the arrival of eight people and their movements around the house including what I'm doing right now? And if's also waiting to see if those people and the eight pawns representing them still keep on moving the same way all night. I think this is what the Professor's experiment is about. It's not by chance he involved us, as we too are studying ways to calculate future events. Too much work has gone to your head Karl. That's all you can see. I am merely observing facts, as so should you. We are the guinea pigs. I don't know about you but I didn't come here to play at being a guinea pig. - Let's find a way out. - Let's go. - Let's get away from here. Four of us can explore this floor and the cellar, and the others can come with me to the attic. I'll take care of the cellar. Roy, where's the rendez vous? At the model. I could hardly believe it, yet it was really an SOS and so I called the Port Authorities, and they confirmed they had lost contact with the boat more than half an hour ago... - Had I been you I'd have linked them up. - Well that's just what I did. Are you listening to me? - So you linked them up. That's right. But I can tell you, not everybody can handle two frequencies at the same time. Well, did you find a way out? - No. - And you didn't either? The Professor wasn't joking. We're prisoners. So now we are all here, how about killing time with some games? Just a moment, we aren't all... Where's Herbert? Wasn't he with you? - Yes, but then he turned back. - Maybe he found a way out. - It's more likely he's lost in the mansion. - He's alone in this maze... Thank goodness I was leading my group. Let's go back and look for him. Just a moment. If Herbert were wandering around the house, we should see his pawn moving. But nothing is happening here. That model only shows the facade. He may have stopped to take a nap. Let's go and look for him Isaac. Don't leave this room. One day my grandad asked me to wait for him in the car. That was the last time I ever saw him. Here we are in front of a mechanical masterpiece, and it doesn't interest any of you. - Why don't you gag him? - You admire that toy, don't you... I could go off and take a shower. Who knows if the Professor planned that, too? - Where are you going, Idiot? - Just to relax a bit. Roy told us not to go away. And did Roy tell you if I could smoke my pipe? Stop showing off with that thing. Anyone can see you're not very bright. Good evening and welcome. This is Professor Cornelius speaking. At the moment I'm not home, not because I'm rude but it's part of the experiment to which you've been invited. The field of research is the same you've been working on for a long time: the possibility to estimate physical events. Karl, do you think this drawing is one of Prof. Cornelius's projects? That's not a project, it's just fantasy. How can you say this thing can't fly? I'm not the one who says it, but the law of gravity. Now go back to your dream world. A lot of progress has emerged from dreams. Did you know that? Maybe, but you have to distinguish between what's feasible and what isn't. I prefer to kid myself nothing is impossible. Put that drawing back. Make yourselves at home. Good bye. There's nothing we can do. Seems he's vanished. We've tried calling him but... Isaac, Roy, welcome back... The tape continues! No, it's the professor live. He saw us come in. No, you're wrong Isaac. This is a tape. Don't let him fool you. He's only just answered. How could it be a tape? Look, the video is reproducing the tape. Yes, Sophia has just forgotten to stop it. If it's really a tape, put it on "Pause", smarty. Good Bruno, put it on "Pause". It really is a tape. Bruno, release the "Pause". It isn't pleasant waiting on "Pause". Yes it's true. I've envisaged everything, including what you'll say. This gave me the chance to register the tape that we can use, if you like to talk on time delay. Naturally it is up to you to decide if and when you want to use my presence. Why don't you stop that tape? It's typical for a human being to be frightened when faced with a new discovery. Let's see if he is really so smart. Happy, Roy? - Try back-tracking a bit. - This experiment... Have you finished playing with the tape? Happy, Roy? This experiment tends to demonstrate how anything at all, including the human mind, can be illustrated mathematically, and therefore be predictable. After in depth studies, I've succeeded in developing a mathematical formula describing human personality and it is so accurate it can anticipate every single gesture and thought. But everyone is different! A matter of just a few variables Isaac... Was it necessary to lock us up? Why did you kidnap us? What an inadequate word Sophia I didn't want you to leave the laboratory. Where's Herbert? Why has he disappeared? I had to force events. Well, gentlemen. See you later. Why doesn't he tell us where Herbert is? Should there be an intellect, capable of locating every atom in the universe and the momentum behind it. And if such an intellect was so great as to analyze such a bulk of data it could encapsulate it all into a unique formula from which it would be possible to deduce any event, be it past... ...or future. Pierre Simon Laplace... - That is. - Laplace, 18th century mathematician. He theorized that everything existing in nature, including human beings, behave like cogs in one enormous clock and that as such you could use mathematics to estimate their actions. But that's pure folly. Those theories are outdated. They'd be impossible calculations. Who could ever manage them? No-one. Actually this so-called super intellect capable of grasping everything, is known as The Demon of Laplace... Demon? Maybe Cornelius thinks he's the Demon. And as he can't have a full control of the entire universe, he's decided to restrict his range of action to this mansion. That's why we're locked in here. And we should stay here, cut off in the middle of the sea in the hands of this madman? You, Bruno, you're a ham radio operator. Who me? Well sort of .. If all you do is brag about it. Yes, he kept his nerve. Just imagine, he can manage two frequencies at the same time. What do have in mind Roy? I saw an old CB radio up in the attic. We could call the police! Come on, aren't we worrying too much? Karl, Herbert's disappeared! Let's go, Bruno. I think you're all hysterical. Much ado about nothing. Herbert's just lost. Where's his pawn? Well, gentlemen... See you later. Where's that idiot off too? This is a mad house! Calm down Alfred, don't lose your head. You're all losing it and you still haven't realized that this, too, was expected. Look at the model. Those two there. .. Are Roy and Bruno going up to the attic. And there's Jim Bob just gone out. We're behaving exactly as Cornelius imagined. Like puppets in his hands. Or like the glasses in our experiments. Human beings expect to control things but don't want to be controlled. Determinism and entropy... Karl those philosophic matters are solved. And who says so? The fact we are no longer posing questions, doesn't mean a definite answer has been found. Mankind is always convinced to have reached the apex of knowledge, so branding earlier theories as being obsolete. - Roy, where's Bruno? - What happened up there? That's what I'd like to know. A Black Queen has appeared in the model. It's eaten one of the pawns. Tell us what happened, Roy. We'd just put our hands on the CB radio. When suddenly the lights went out and we heard something heavy dragging towards us. We ran away but we lost sight of Bruno in the dark. He probably remained behind. And that thing, reached him. What thing? What reached him? Someone's coming in! - Jim Bob where had you got to? - We're in serious danger and you're wandering around the mansion? - Danger? - Stop clowning around. This is no holiday, get it? I can't see what I did wrong, I only went... Jim Bob, Bruno's just vanished. He hasn't disappeared, Isaac. Let's face reality. Herbert and Bruno have probably been killed. By something hiding in this house. Something that's part of the professor's plan. This isn't an experiment, it's a death trap, for all of us. Now we can see what Cornelius meant by forcing events. Adding an element of danger. Survival instinct. It makes us all more predictable. Is it possible that you don't care about Bruno and Herbert? Who cares about them? Let them burn in Hell. We should be trying to clear out! Alfred, now you're exaggerating. You know perfectly well we can't leave. You dragged me into this mess, and you'll get me out of it! - It was the professor who engaged you. - We're just as much victims as you are. Let's destroy his toy then! Why are we still going along with him? Don't lose your head Alfred. That is just what the professor wants. But what have you all got in your heads? Why don't you react? Drink this, it will calm you down. I've got who you are, you scientists. To prove your theories, you played with a glass. But now that glass, isn't enough. - Alfred, what are doing? - Don't get near me! This is all farce! You're experimenting on me! Put it down. Keep your distance, you prick! I'm wrecking that cursed machine! I'll be damned if I don't! I'm afraid Cornelius has planned the same end for us as for that glass. Fear... It's the fear in us that makes us react predictably. Maybe we should forget to be afraid. Do you think a glass can ignore the force of gravity? Why not? Look. Swap the birds with my paper planes. There's a strong wind tonight. It can take us all a long way, all of us. I envy you, Jim Bob. You can always joke. I'm not joking at all. It's when we believe things are impossible that they become so. Here it is! Coming back! - It's coming towards us. - No! It's moving towards Alfred! It isn't possible... Open up for Heaven's sake, open up! It's coming, hurry! Open this damned door! Open! No! I think we're facing something mechanical. Something perfectly synchronized to our movements. Just like that model. Only that... This is programmed to kill. A machine programmed to hit in a certain place and at a certain time. And at increasingly shorter intervals. I've noticed the Queen appears every time a huge spiral spring uncoils among the cogs. Right now it's slowly rewinding. Gaining energy. To be suddenly released. If the Queen continues to attack at this speed, by dawn there'll be no pawns left. If this is the problem I've got an idea. Let's stop the model. What for? That would be like... Breaking a thermometer to fight off a temperature. Truly worthy sirs, excellent points. I thank you for having left the tape running. This way we can exchange a few words. Where are the others? Maniac! What a drop in tone, Isaac Bradbury. As you have already fully understood, the Queen is programmed to eat you one by one. Only tomorrow morning when the mansion is totally empty will it be possible to ascertain if the experiment was successful and if my formulas are exact. Dear Sophia, you had previously said I intended to impersonate the Laplace's Demon. You're wrong, The Demon is not me, but the very formula. As soon as I discovered it I applied it to myself. You can't imagine. Foreseeing your own behavior is like reading the future. At first I couldn't believe what the formula was offering me. But experience confirmed it was never wrong. About anything. So when the formula revealed I would carry out the experiment, there was nothing else I could do. Sorry, gentlemen. But this is pure folly. A man who obeys mathematical calculations... I guarantee this experiment is costing me a lot, too. But what is a human life in front of perfection? Well, I hope, 'm sure we'll be in touch later. Don't count on it. For us, this tape doesn't exist anymore. It's all my fault. I dragged you into this mess. You're right, Isaac. However you rescued me from lunch with my mother-in-law. Why do you think the professor chose chess to illustrate the situation? Eight pawns and a Queen. The weaker against the stronger. The message is clear. We have no hope of winning. It seems as if Cornelius is doing everything to break our spirit, or even to make us feel resigned. Well... let's take away the Bishops, Knights, Towers and the King. Eight pawns confront a Queen. Five pawns. You're right. So... They certainly can't attack, but they can defend themselves... - How. By staying together, so that when the Queen attacks, she'll be eaten. But the Queen would never make such a stupid move. Of course and that's the exact purpose: create the conditions under which no one can attack, and the game goes into a deadlock. Going for a draw instead of a victory. On the chessboard this works well, but in real life? What do you plan to do? Castling. (Chess move) Castling? What have we been doing so far? But the Queen has never been threatened. We know if she wants to reach us she has to go through that door, and we won't stop her, as this time there won't be a barricade waiting. But a trap. A trap? But if we don't even know what we're up against. Do you have a better idea? Two pawns inside this room, and three outside that think we can checkmate the Queen. When she appears she'll know exactly how to get us. My world's crumbling apart Karl. I don't know what to think. Thinking won't save us. Really... until this afternoon even the most insignificant things seemed to escape me. Every glass that broke left either a few more or a few less pieces than we had expected. I started thinking nature was too complicated to be expressed in mathematical terms. And yet this evening, we've seen it isn't so. The ideal formula, the one that can clinch every variable, exists. It is only a matter of finding it. Then everything will be clear, straightforward. From the broken glass to the human being. Nothing can escape its laws, not even thought. Free will is nothing but a deception of the mind. A limited view of reality. Think about our daily life. We get up in the morning, go to work. Cross the road on the green light. We eat, drink and why? To earn money, to avoid being run over, because we're hungry or thirsty. Every our actions is nothing but a reaction to some other need. Do you know what I think Karl? You're under psychological pressure that this damned experiment is putting on us. I'm just looking at reality. Even you must admit Cornelius isn't getting his estimates wrong. It's easy to evaluate a frightened person's behavior. What's up Isaac? Why are you shouting? A useless exchange of opinions. Well, I'm going to pull this... Give it to me. You're reckless. How much time do we have, Karl? Ten minutes. Maybe less. It would take so little to be saved. If we only knew exactly in the house we are supposed to die. I can't see much faith in my plan. At least you're trying to do something. That lighter of yours must have some special meaning. I've had it for years. It's a talisman. It doesn't seem to be working today. It will. At the right time. No, you keep it. You can give it back. When we're out of here. The mechanism seems to be blocked. Your plan may have stalled it. It could want us to think it's stalled. Concentrate on the model, Isaac. This isn't the time to speculate. Oh my gosh, The Queen is inside here! She's behind the model! Everyone out! Where are you, Roy? - Be careful! - This way! What the hell... Escape! - The door's blocked! - Coming! It's coming this way! Follow me, Sophia! Let's go away! Hurry up Karl! - Are you all here? - I think so! Hold on, here we are. It's following us! There it is! - Everyone upstairs! - We'll get out the window, Roy! Come over here! - I can't see anything! - Hurry up, hurry! I left her behind. I'll never forgive myself. I thought she was beside me. At least you reacted. I-.- I was frozen stiff. Fear is one's worst enemy. We should all get drunk. That's how you give into fear. While you're fighting it? You have to keep a clear mind, rely on reason, and be strong enough to get to the bottom of it all. The bottom of what? The coffin? You're right. There's no point in drinking. Neither will reason be much use against this type of enemy. I think that acting according to logic, is the worst thing we can do in this situation. What are you getting at? Cornelius expects us to react according to mathematical calculations. So far he hasn't made a slip, but if we began to act irrationally his formulas would fail,. Simple, senseless things could elude his plan... Every action is always laid down by a precise purpose. Just imagine if we ignored the coffin and we could be found concentrating on a game of cards. Do you think Cornelius could have thought of that? Such behavior would be aimed at avoiding the Professor's estimates. See, illogical actions don't exist. And yet the solution is so close to hand we can almost touch it. All we need is to guess one move and it would all crack up. The slightest thing, an unplanned pause could cause a totally different chain of events to the one that would lead us into the coffin. Don't tell me you're resigned to this, Karl? Of course he is. Am I right Karlheinz? All you do is criticize. You're not proposing anything. If it depended on you we would all just be sitting here waiting for our end. But we're going to attack, without any strategy or calculated plans. Here's another one. You'd like to punch up the coffin. Why not? Instinct will tell us how to attack. Bare-handed, or with improvised weapons. The important thing is not to reason on what we're doing. Just do it. But, Roy... You're already thinking too much, Isaac. Don't let reasoning get the upper hand. But this is sheer folly! It's a suicide! Maybe that's just what Cornelius doesn't expects. We don't know anything about his plan. All we have is his tape that you are stopping us from seeing. We only know the coffin will come to get us! Well just stay here and wait your turn. Keep on following your instinct! Come on, how do you think natural selection works? That's enough, Karl! You're exaggerating. You're thinking too much. And thinking won't save us... Remember? If we're really done for, let's at least go as men, not cowards. My instinct says to open the window and fly off. But I'll try to be manly. Thank you Karlheinz. You've just rewound the tape and you're the only one here at the moment. In about 40 seconds you'll hear a scream coming from the corridor. Don't worry, it's Isaac getting worked up over nothing. He'd like to save some of his staff but, poor thing, he doesn't have enough strength. Am I right or are you, foo, losing strength, Karl? The others have always looked on you as being strong, sure, determined to reach your goals. If you waver you can compromise everything. After all it's good that you have to disappear. Karl! Escape! The coffin! The coffin! The coffin was still near the door. Then it started moving. Where is it now? Why isn't it here? It caught up to Karl. A terrible crash! Andi... I didn't do anything. Isaac, where did it go? To what corner of the room? I didn't have enough strength, Roy. Don't blame yourself. Cornelius knew you wouldn't react. Listen to me. There must be a secret passage in this room. We have to find it before the spring uncoils. I don't want other surprises. Isaac. I know how you feel. Your conscience won't stop pricking you. You led your staff into this trap and you haven't been able to protect them. Herbert, Bruno, Sophia, Karlheinz, gone. And you are to blame. But I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself. At least partly. That sadistic pervert. He's playing with us, like a cat with a mouse. And what's that? WHERE'S ISAAC? The spring... It hasn't uncoiled! What a good idea leaving that trap there, Roy. It's been very useful for me. Don't make those faces. Be relieved for Isaac, who has finally done something worthy of a true leader such as he had never done before. He's sacrificed himself for you. To give you a bit more time he got into the coffin of his own accord. Convinced it was worthwhile. Face us directly, coward! There's no opponent to face, only destiny, which is inevitable. We are all free falling glasses dear Jim Bob, and we can't ignore the force of gravity. Ignore the force of gravity. Have you ever wondered why the pawn only moves forward? Because it doesn't think it can do otherwise. Keep your eyes open. The coffin is coming back again. Don't get distracted! The real coffin is on the way! It's only a reflection! REPORT ON THE EXPERIMENT "Sophia and Bruno reach Jim Bob who takes a photo." "Don't you think this looks familiar?" "No, not at all." "But of course! It's an exact reproduction of this mansion! "Bruno comes back into the room and Roy says: The door's jammed, there's no ways of opening. "This alarms Alfred. He says sharply: Have you checked it carefully?" "It's an armored door." "Sophia has the best hearing in the group. She hears the handle turning looks towards the door and exclaims: Someone's coming in! "But what have you all got in your heads? Why don't you do react?" "Take this, it'll calm you down..." "Here she is, coming back!" "Open up! It's coming here!" "Where are the others, you maniac!" "That lighter of yours must have some special meaning." "Pay attention, keep on searching." "Which way did the coffin go?" "The spring! It hasn't uncoiled!" "It hasn't uncoiled!" "On the fourth blow, Roy breaks open the sliding panel and gets into the secret passage. He sees the camera, recognizes the set..." "Roy takes the report and starts studying it..." "He reads page 32 which tells how the model was found." "Roy turns to this page and reads this line..." "Roy reads this line..." "Roy reads this line..." "Roy reads this line..." "The Queen is programmed to eat you one by one." "I've noticed the Queen appears every time a huge coil spring uncoils among the cogs." "The coffin was still near the door, then it started moving." "It caught up with Karl... A terrible crash! "There must be a secret passage in this room." "We have to find it before the spring uncoils." "The spring! It hasn't uncoiled!" Wretched beast! ROY HAS UNDERSTOOD WHO I AM CHECKMATE TO ROY A toast to your colleagues! Who cooperated on the project and they never suspected you. Karl... Why should they have? You're right. They simply followed the script written for them and you behaved exactly as calculated even in the most critical moments. You and your coffin managed to hide really well, Karl. But as you know, the most difficult part is yet to come. Foreseeing actions of others is quite a task, but the true masterpiece is in foreseeing your own actions. You know what is ahead of you now. Every great achievement requires dedication, and sacrifice. This is a very interesting moment Karl, as right now you are not sure you'll go through with the job. Would you prefer the experiment failed? So in a few moments, you'll be getting into the coffin on your own accord. Just as the formula set out. And you know the formula is never wrong. You have no idea what it means being here now. Look at me Karl. Only two weeks have passed since you recorded this message. Look how determined you were to follow it all through. I want you to be so even now. But who am I speaking to? When you apply the formula to yourself, you generate a type of short circuit. A loop. It's as if you're between two mirrors and your own image is reflected to infinity. There's no point wondering how many reflections of Karlheinz you can see. As it's useless continuing this discussion. You know what I told you and I know what you'll tell me. I just want to remind you that the success of this experiment is more important than your life. Now I'm not so sure anymore. That's not surprising, Karl. It was all in the estimate. At this moment you're dominated by your survival instinct. The strongest instinct of human nature, and it doesn't let you reason. If you don't get into the coffin, you'd save your life but the formula would be wrong. All you research would go up in smoke, and don't forget that now, for the law, you're a criminal. There would be no reason in continuing such a compromised life. You're wrong. I could correct the formula! No, all the work would be wasted. So far, the formula has been correct! It would just need to be improved on! The formula is already perfect, and you know it, and it clearly says what is ahead of you. You're delirious only because you're in front of the coffin. But were the experiment to fail due to you, it would be even worse. You couldn't bear the disappointment. Set your mind at rest. You don't have a choice, and that's the point Karl. Freedom of choice doesn't exist. I can't do it. I don't have the courage. Yet the estimates are perfectly clear. In a few moments the music will stop, and you, of your own accord, will walk into the coffin. I say I can't do it. You haven't convinced me. That doesn't matter. What's important is that before long you'll be in the coffin. But how? How? Another glass shattered. 387 pieces. And just think, Isaac's software couldn't even estimate that! But It didn't break! How much time wasted on this useless program. With those useless people. The glass didn't break! Well, here we are! Can you hear me? The glass is intact! Why don't you answer? The formula is wrong! 35 seconds to the triumphal end. But what triumph? The experiment is a failure! Leave this world as a winner, Karl. I have failed. 20 seconds. The experiment is over. An now I'm addressing those people who want to understand what happened in this mansion. I, Karlheinz Von Scach, have conducted an important experiment following a revolutionary discovery. A discovery that will make mankind face his true nature, which is not that of being autonomous in decision making. What we call free will, is nothing but a mere illusion. Everything that happens, every action every thought, every emotion follows a rigid logic of cause and effect. From this point of view, I have managed to elaborate or rather, to discover a mathematical formula capable of estimating human behavior with the same precision that you can calculate that in one minute the second hand of a clock will make a complete revolution. So I tested it on myself and my colleagues. Since you have had no news of us, the experiment has succeeded. On the other hand, I didn't decide anything. It was the formula that revealed our lives would end here, in this isolated mansion, thanks to a mechanical coffin, programmed by me to prove the very validity of the formula. It almost seems that hidden in the equation, there's a demon, a type of monster that devours whoever gets near it. Whoever hears of it, whoever tries to gain from it. Well, there is no advantage in knowing our future. However, we have a burning desire to change it, to deny the forecast. That is exactly how a human being reacts in front of the formula. And that is how he begins to lose the battle where every move has been contemplated. Every single one. Except, of course, those that are impossible.
