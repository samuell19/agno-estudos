Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation Film company VERA and TV channel ROSSIA TV PRESENT IVEN DENISOVICH The camp was in the middle of a large field surrounded by forest. Night covered everything and transformed the barracks and the service buildings with their strings of electric lights into a festive nightly surprise for the uninitiated. For example, for the passengers of planes flying to Leningrad or Helsinki on the northern route. But that's not our goal. We have another way. This is the commander of an anti-tank gun, Sergeant Ivan Denisovich Schukhov. Before being called up, he worked as a mechanic and chauffeur at a tractor station. He has a family: his beloved wife Natalya, a zoo technician at the same MTS, and two daughters - four-year-old Katja and the older Lisa, who turned seven on June 22, '41. The next day, Schukhov was drafted into the army. He was trained as an artilleryman for a month and a half and Sent to the front in mid-August. He shot down two tanks, was wounded, received a medal for bravery and the rank of staff sergeant. -And, you take the gun? -I take her. sign. ZIS-3 gun accepted. Signed... Sergeant Schukhov. Ivan Denisovich. The gun is new, from the factory. Is there any preparation required before the first shot? -Naturally! Absolutely! -In fact? -Load weapon. -That's it? No, not yet. You also have to aim! Understood, father. We do our best. Go Go! Ivan Denisovich Schukhov. -To the front line? -Yes indeed. Straight to the artillery battalion. You're waiting. -You'll have to wait even longer. - That's not possible, Comrade Major. We still have to get ammo. A third is waiting for us. -Who? -gun loader Stepan Matafonov -keeps the place in line. -Very good. You get the ammunition - that's on the way, on the Wolokolämsker Chaussee at the exit. First time in Moscow? -I've been there. -Even in Red Square? Naturally. With my wife on May Day. Very good. Make your way there. Order of General Artemyev, Moscow Military District. -Why, Comrade Major? -Because of the parade. -Today is a holiday. -Which one? November seventh. Anniversary of the October Revolution. Forget? That is correct. I haven't slept in two nights. There are three trucks with guns behind the gate. Follow them. You are number four. -The patrol will guide you. -Carry out! Yes indeed! -We're going to Red Square! -How so? To the military parade. An order from the Commander of the Moscow Military District, General Artemyev! Unbelievable! ♪ Rise thou mighty motherland! 3 ♪ Rise for a fight to the death S ♪ To crush the evil fascist hordes. ♪ ♪ Let the noble wrath boil over like a wave! + ♪ Let the noble wrath boil over like a wave! + ♪ This is a people's war! A holy war! 3 ♪ Let the noble wrath boil over like a wave! + ♪ This is a people's war! A holy war! 3 No matter how hard Schukhov tried to find out who was who among the figures standing on the mausoleum, he could only make out Marshal Budjony and Comrade Stalin. This worried Schukhov and sharpened his sense of responsibility for the task entrusted to him. In the back seat of his truck sat twelve artillery cadets, whom he had to drop off here at Wassiljewski Spüsk, to then proceed to the front of his battery. -We are there! -To the car! You to the right, we to the left. All the best, Comrade Oberfeldwebel! You also! Do you know where to go? -Yes indeed! -Then all the best! Right way! March, one, two! Come on, Wässja, let's drive! Unbelievable. I saw Budyonny! He stood in the stands like he was alive. He's alive. And who was this man standing next to him with a mustache? He seemed so familiar. Who was that? Comrade Stalin. Yes, exactly. How could I not recognize him? That should bring him luck. The Germans! They want to attack us from behind! Get off the street! -What shall we do now? -Shoot. Prepare for battle! -Ready. -Come on! Go faster! And load! Finished! First the tank! First the car so the infantry wouldn't scatter. The tank can't see us. Fire! hit! Yes! Ammunition! Load! Loaded! Fire! hit. Let's get out of here. We will wait. The Germans will come back soon. Our position is very good. You can't see us. There are no tracks in the snow in front of us. Agreed. well If we'd gotten out of the woods a little sooner, we'd be dead by now. But we are not. That is it. Because He led us. I don't understand how the Fritzen got through the woods. There must be a path. Aha, that's how long the bastards squeezed through. That's how it will be. Let's get ready. Get out ten to fifteen grenades. Better twenty. Agreed. And take the truck away. Carry out! Ivan, a messenger has come. -Hi guys! What an action! -Hi. Moment. The shaft? Here is the carriage. how do you hear me End! Please. Major Stupin on the line. I'm listening, comrade Major. Yes indeed! The mission is accomplished! The cannon is great! She's spot on! We received all of the ammunition. As? Have you seen everything? Thank you, Comrade Major. I'll tell them. I see it. The tanks are coming. On to the fight! Load weapon! -Hide and tie the horse! -Come on, come on! Fire! hit! Loaded! To the third tank! Fire! hit! Ready! Fire! Load weapon! He is breathing. So? -Stand up! - Come help him. Schukhov, Ivan Denisovich -Pull it over. -Come. He is still alive. Take him to headquarters for questioning. And the second? -Is he alive? -Experienced. Him aswell. Other direction. Other direction. And off. From the German interrogation report: "First Sergeant Schukhov and his assistant Sergeant Nikitin flatly refused to cooperate with us. They are to be used as consumables. prisoners of war! They were sentenced to death by firing squad. But there is a chance of survival for the brave and bold. I hope my Russian is not that bad. I am the son of Ekaterina Vasilyevna Andreyeva, born in Moscow. And I think you understand me well. So gentlemen. Ahead is a mined road marked with a red flag. It leads east, towards Moscow. The mines must be removed. To do this, I order you to form rows of five set up at a distance of three meters. On the command "Forward March" start moving calmly, without hurrying. Those lucky enough to make it to the clearing gets a warm meal. Please look to the right. There you see a table and a field kitchen. The scent speaks for itself. For the first course - soup with dumplings in meat broth, for the second course - tender Wiener schnitzel with fried potatoes; and for dessert - hot aromatic tea with sugar and a bun. Delicious, isn't it? Besides that... we promise the survivors jobs in Germany. In a factory or on a farm - as desired, according to your qualifications. Those who don't want that are welcome to return. The road in the clearing is not mined. But I warn you that you will be mistaken for German spies, because you returned from German captivity. And one more thing. If one of you stops or turns around, he will be shot immediately. I wish you good luck. -Continue. -Yes indeed! At your command! Danger! Heed my command! First row! at walking pace, Forward march! Forward! Do not stop! Go ahead! Ivan, it's me right behind you. Well, the two are still alive. let her go I don't envy her. Half a day later they reached their people from the neighboring battalion. The artillerymen fed them handed them tea and tobacco and called Major Stupin. It turned out, that the major had already been in the hospital for three days because he was injured. Then they came to fetch them. Who is Schukhov here? Here. -Who is Nikitin? -Here. -Follow me outside. -What happened? We have a couple of questions. Departure! you, Nikitin, did you follow Schukhov on a mined road? Yes indeed. -And so you escaped? -Right. And you, Schukhov, led your daughter? That is correct. The eldest, Lisa. -How old is she? -Seven and a half. -And how did she get there? -She appeared to me. It exploded next to me, I passed out. When I came to, I heard nothing, but I saw Lisa, who stood there and gave me her hand and called me to her. I kind of got up, walked over to her. And she took my hand and led me away. And me after him. Do you really expect me to believe that shit? That's not shit, Comrade Major, it really was like that. -Is that true? -Naturally. -And where is the daughter? -I do not know. So, you artillery heroes, we checked the facts. You actually hit five enemy tanks and one vehicle with infantry. Major Stüpin even gave you awards for it. Posthumously. And you were alive and well in captivity with the Germans. And that's when you were recruited invented a cover story and sent you to your people as spies. Is something like that possible? Absolutely. I wish I could help. But your explanations are worthless and intended for simpletons. And that's why we won't risk sending you back to your battery. Skworzow! Get those heroes out of my sight. Where to, Comrade Major? Yes, where do you want to go? To the sanatorium! To Sochi. For ten years. -Together? -Cut. It doesn't work together. Together they are a team. Where is the second going? To the resort in Gägra! For ten years. Anyway... the court decides. I obey. Follow me! Schukhov! Take it. Thank you. A lot has changed in the world in the last ten years. The hard war with Hitler and the war with Japan ended in victory. Kurchatov and his associates built the Soviet atomic bomb, which was stronger than the American bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The country was reborn. And here in the camp, life seemed frozen. Four years ago, Schüchow received a postcard from his home village. On the postcard it was stated that his wife Natalia Petrovna Schukhov on May Day died of the measles contracted from her daughters. The girls have recovered. They were taken to the city, to an orphanage. The address was sent, thank God. Correspondence was established - two letters a year, as was usual in the camp. In the first two years, the daughters wrote more often, especially the eldest. But for two years not a single letter has come. Neither from the youngest nor from the older ones. And this filled Ivan Denisovich with great concern. Save and keep her, O Lord. Look, Ivan Denisovich. Your soul is asking to pray to God. Why don't you just let her? Therefore, Alyosha! These prayers are like petitions. Either no response or "the complaint is rejected". That's why, Ivan Denisovich, that you have prayed too little, too badly and without diligence. That is why your prayers have not come true. Prayer must be constant. If you have faith and say to the mountain: "Go there," he will go. Stop it, Alyosha! I've never seen a mountain go. Admittedly, I've never seen mountains in my life. You prayed in the Caucasus with your whole Baptist club. -Did a mountain move? - We never asked God for that. Of all earthly things He has commanded us just praying for our daily bread. "Our daily bread Give us today." So our ration? Ivan Denisovich. You shouldn't pray that a package is coming or an extra portion of porridge. For what is high among men is an abomination before God. We should pray for spiritual things. May the Lord remove evil from our hearts. Pray or not, they won't shorten the sentence. You'll be lucky if they don't extend it. You don't have to pray for that either. Why the freedom? Your last faith will be choked by thorns. Be glad you're in prison. Here you have time to reflect on your soul. The apostle Paul who said: "What are you doing, crying and breaking my heart? I don't wanna be just a prisoner I am ready to die in the name of the Lord Jesus." Aljöscha, do you actually have children? You know that. I am not married and have no children. But neither did the apostle Paul. But I have some, thank God. My soul is my children, Lisa and Katjüsha. Both grow up in an orphanage without parental supervision. And there are boys and men on the street. You can hurt her, ruin her whole life. I think... now all the time to my girls every minute, every moment. You need me there and not here! Forgive me. I may be wrong. God bless your girls. And she too. LONG LIVE OUR GREAT SOCIALIST HOMELAND USSR! 854. Three nights in solitary confinement, not off work. -What have I done, sir? -Why didn't you get up? -Well, I... -We're going to see the commander. Hurry, make it faster! Forward. Schukhov, you must obey. -You only have a week to serve. -Ten days. Even! I hear your wife died the children are in the orphanage. You haven't written for a long time. Very long. What about you? Tell me. Take and hide it -What is that? -Read it yourself. My wife also died. And I'm raising two daughters. Follow me. Take a bucket and mop the floor. - Thank you, Comrade Overseer. -Carry out! I will never oversleep again! HOSPITAL Thank you, Leonid Lvovich. well I said don't jump off the roof -and you did it. Why? -For a bet. A bet? Now you have to wear a cast for two weeks. What the hell is that?! Why are you pouring so much water, you fool? -Who does that? - Comrade Overseer, there's no other way. -The dirt runs deep. -Have you never seen how your wife mopped the floor? You pig! I was separated from my wife in '41. I don't know what she was like anymore. That's what they call "wiping the floor"! The pigs cannot and do not want to do anything right. Why should you wipe every day? That only creates moisture! -Hey you, number 854! -Yes? So be careful, scrub really lightly to make it shine. And get out of here. DURABLE WORK IS THE SHORTEST WAY HOME -Holy shit. -Who's walking like that, folks? Watch where you step! your fighter. Not bad. That's how you do it, you greenhorns. Follow me! "Hi Papa. I'm sorry I haven't written in a long time. I thought Katjüschka would write. She's totally clumsy. But she is good at school and sings very beautifully, like our mother. The boys follow her every step. Sometimes I even think that's exaggerated. I told her that. But she just laughs back. And I let myself be infected and laugh too. That's how we live. I'm fine too, dad. I am an adult I am seventeen years old. In the evenings I study, I'm in my last year at construction school. And during the day I work as a plasterer. i make good money Congratulations, dear dad, you will soon be a grandfather. I'm expecting a child. I'm so happy! I will definitely have a boy. I'm sure of that, because Yegor, the man I love, only has boys. He has three of them: two are already employed and the third is in fifth grade. And yet Yegor loves only me. And I only love him. He's our foreman. He is a reliable man and a funny one. He is so cute. We will name our son Ivan after you. His name will be Ivan Yegorovich Nalivaykin or Naliwajkin-Schukhov. It will be a kind of bond between our two working class families. I have more good news. Imagine if I was given a room! An eight square meter room with a window and a separate entrance in the dormitory. Me and Yegor plastered it so beautifully! If only you could see it! That's all my news. I kiss you, dear papa. Yegor sends his greetings. Your eldest daughter, Lisa. Your food has gotten cold. I thought you were in the punishment cell wanted to eat it, but you're here, thank god. Sorry. No, I'm sorry. "A delegation of members of the resistance movement against fascism..." -My ration. -Not in the punishment cell? Are you still alive? I'm still alive. "Sports. Leningrad. Dynamo Moscow footballers met today at Kirov Stadium and local team Zenit. The game ended with a score of one to one. Helsinki! A friendly match between the national teams of the USSR and Finland took place today in Helsinki. The meeting was won by the Soviet athletes with a score of 123 to 56. Hooray! Soccer? -Basketball! -When was that? Today? Or? Yes today. On June 23rd. It was studied for six months whether the newspaper "The Truth" actually tells the truth! "It is reported... On June 25, a Soviet delegation traveled consisting of Gündorov, Pissarov, Kuharenko and Chekalenko, to take part in a joint congress of former political prisoners and participants in the fascist resistance movement. The People's Army continued in close cooperation with Chinese volunteers fighting the troops of the American-British invaders and the Li Sa Le Mans troops..." -Zesar Markovich! -Yes. -Where does the conflict happen? -I beg your pardon? The conflict, where did it take place? The conflict took place in Korea. This war, the newspaper concludes, can only end in victory for the Korean people. Lord, give me the strength to endure these insults. Help me pray and bless those who hate us. With the confidence and hope that I shall not be ashamed in any way. But with all boldness shall Christ be glorified in my body, be it in life or in death, now and forever. Lord, thank you for becoming my life. I'm going through this with full confidence in you. I believe with hope that I can do anything strengthened by Jesus Christ. Thank you for your sacrifice on the cross, through which you opened the way to eternal life for us. I thank you for my imprisonment. Help me to stay true to you to the end. Only you know my way, Lord. I'm in your hands You called, comrade colonel? yes major Here is your intern from Moscow. Honorary graduate of combat and theory training Sergeant Ivanov. He would like to stay with us permanently after completing his internship. Roger that. Do you have a wife, children? -Negative. -Parents? Yes. Father and mother. employed? That's right. You are on duty. Well, Sergeant, this is a small facility. The quota is difficult - political, not criminals. -He knows, Major. -Well then, Sergeant, go ahead and see for yourself. -And then we'll talk. -Yes indeed. permission to go? allowed. This is General Ivanov's son. For real? By Sergei Pavlovich? What is he doing here? Couldn't he find a better place? An ambitious young man, that's why he comes to us. He wants to upgrade the industry. -You're joking. -Not at all. The mother is crying, the father has given up on him. That's why he wants to turn our camp into the Garden of Eden. In time, Major. All in good time. Have a chat with him. He's an interesting young man. Alright. Stand up, Brigade 104. We go. The political briefing is over. Thanks. Come on, move! Don't dawdle! You're falling asleep again! Here, plug this in. -23? -23. -And who is missing? - Panteleyev is ill. -What does he say? - Hello, Nikolai Ivanovich. Hello, greetings, Ivan Denisovich. Good morning I hope the day will be good too. Come to my workshop tonight after dinner. I have something for you. I'm not going to the village today, I'll spend the night here. I have urgent work. Thank you, Nikolai Ivanovich. I will definitely come. There you go, now the boss will be satisfied. Zesar Märkowitsch, let me go. Please, Ivan Denisovich. My Lisa is probably in trouble. What happened? She writes that she is expecting a child from her lover, that he loves her very much, that he has three sons. Two are grown... and one is ten, still a schoolboy. Not a word about marriage. And they can't even get married officially - she just turned seventeen three months ago. And he's probably forty, I think, maybe older. Widowed or divorced. Or maybe he has a wife or he's a swindler! Ivan Denisovich, come on. It's only ten days. Then you're out there helping your daughter. I will help her if i ever make it out of here What if they extend my sentence? -No... -That would be worse than death. They don't. They work for two, behave prudently, as is appropriate in your position. Of course I do my best. And yet I know how difficult it is for her alone. Open your shirts! Get ready for the inspection! They take our undershirts! That's it for the good morning. Be glad these pigs don't take our pants. Let's go boys! Let's go. What is this gathering? -Listen... -Resign, scumbag! Why are you undressing us? Because you have maybe three kilos of groceries with you, to flee. You have no right to undress people in the cold. Don't you know the ninth article of the Criminal Code? We... know him very well. But you, my brother... don't get it yet. They are not Soviet people. Ten days of solitary confinement. take care tonight Search! Allowed are: two tops. shirt and a singlet. Take off the rest! If you wear more, take it off right here in the cold! Note who wears more. In the evening they have to hand it in at the warehouse. And give an explanation as to why they wore it. That's it. next row! Go Go go! Get undressed faster! Don't keep the others waiting! When the cold creeps under your shirt, you can't get rid of it. The next five! Attention prisoners! When running you have to stay in formation, always keep the same pace, not to leave your own row of five! Open the gate! Danger! stood still! Danger! Forward march! Take bigger steps, you lazy scumbags! Do not speak! Don't look around! arms behind your back! A step to the right or to the left counts as an escape. The convoy opened fire without warning! Go Go go! Run faster, you pricks! The first five forward! Next five forward! Pawloö, lead the brigade to the scene, waste no time. Melt the furnace, prepare the mortar. mason! Let's see what we're doing today. Comes. Comes. They arrived at the construction site, a big and old factory covered with scaffolding, WHERE completely inconspicuous, without pathos, the big conversion, the transformation of the old into the progressive new company through work started by convicts. In less than seven years it will what was created here, amaze the world with flights into space. It must be twelve. The sun is at its highest. If so, Ivan Denisovich, then it is not twelve, but one. Why that? All grandfathers know that the sun is at its highest at noon. That used to be the case. But since there was a decree the sun is at its highest at one o'clock. -By whose order? -Soviet authorities. Does even the sun have to obey her commands? Do you know why Oskar Luts hasn't written a comedy about winter yet? Why? Because he's never had to work like this in winter! Let's sit by the fire for a bit. You, Senka, will work after lunch. -What? -You work after lunch. Aha. The dirty stuff is full of germs. You will still get syphilis. Leave it! Wait 'til you've spent five years here maybe you can start with that too. Well, people, Schukhov, he's practically already at home with one foot. Just with one. Schukhov has served his time. Slowly on the home stretch, Ivan? Not so hasty. A lot can still happen. -Oh, come on, Ivan. -Imagine! On your own two feet to freedom! Don't count down your years in prison. Whether you serve your 25 or not is still in the stars. But I've served my ten years. Here, crawling in the dirt, there is no time to think how to get here and how to get out. You, Ivan, had it easier for five years. You were in regular camps. No, folks, it's definitely quieter here. Should it be quieter? Here some people have their throats cut at night. Is that what you call quiet? They're not people, they're spies. You're an idiot. Here it is important that you work and then you go to sleep. And the ration is a hundred grams larger here. No, buddy, it's good to live here. The camp is "special". So what? What's up? Are you bothered by the numbers, or what? They don't mean anything! Fetyukov, where are you going? Fetyukov?! Semyon Borisovich Fetyukov... used to be an important man. He drove a private car. He had three children and a beautiful wife. After the conviction, everyone gave up on him. So he couldn't expect help from anyone. His wife remarried. He missed his children very much. His wife, the bitch, actually wrote to him: "Forget them, your children are not yours. You don't need to miss her. Live for yourself and in peace". Now he found his peace. From dust we are born... ...TO dust we return. -Göptschik, how much do you have? -Ten years. -And how old are you? -Not quite seventeen. -Why are you here? -I said something. -What did you say? -I said in history class, that the government should also love its people. Why "also"? Do you think people love government? -Of course they do. -You too? No not more. What for? -Did you love her before? -Of course I have. -Are your parents still alive? -The father was killed in the war. My mum... Mom died of grief when she found out I was sentenced. Then you are an orphan. an orphan. It is getting warmer. It's not colder than minus 18 degrees. Good for masonry. Now listen. Can you lend me some tobacco until tonight? -Will he keep his word? -Who then? Ivan? Ivan always pays his debts. The Brigadier got praise for our work today. The next five days... we get the full ration. Many Thanks. -A nice guy. -Yes, that is him. Guys, so that the mortar does not freeze, we line up in pairs. Schukhov, you go with Kljowshin, and I'll stick with Kildigs. Ivan Denisovich, step up your laying! And you make sure you tighten the line faster! -Give me the mortar! -Yes, bring the mortar! -The mortar will come soon! -The mortar is coming! And for me too! So, shall we step on the gas? Let's cut them out. thyrin! What? That tar paper, where does it come from? You won't get away with solitary confinement. Your sentence will be extended. Your time to make life difficult for us is over. Say another word about it, you bloodsucker, you experience your last day Remember that! Come on. Calm down folks. What should I tell the construction manager? That she was already there when we got here. And get the elevator fixed! We're not donkeys lugging bricks up here! - That's what you get paid for! - I should take a wheelbarrow! Try rolling up one of these ramps! That should be paid extra! I do not mind! But the accounting would not allow that! The accounting. My whole brigade works to serve four bricklayers. How much will I earn there? Muscovite, engineer. Worked in the ministry. -Are you an engineer? -Bio faculty, not finished. In the fourth year I was sentenced. twenty-five years. They say you took the blame for your brother. Exactly. He has four children and only one kidney left. This isn't a health resort, he wouldn't last a year here. Well, I'm fine, so for now... Working hey! Keep going! Why should a convict slave away in a camp for ten years? He could loaf around all day and the night would be his. But that's not possible. That's why the brigade was invented. Not the kind of brigade Ivan Ivanovich was in his own wages and Pjotr ​​Petrovich his own wages. In the camp, the brigade is a structure where the inmates have to be pushed around, not by the bosses, but by the inmates. Exactly after Lenin: "Not directly dependent on enthusiasm, but with the help of enthusiasm for economic calculation you should toil." And they toiled. Either everyone gets a bonus or you will all die. You don't work, you bastard, and I'll sit hungry because of you! No, work, you bastard. One for all, all for one. What a prototype for the brigades of the future later dubbed the "brigades of communist labor" by state propagandists, as an example of the highest consciousness and organization of the collective. Captain, bring the mortar! Aljoschka, make it faster. Can't you see they're waiting? Faster you say? Then I'll go faster. -As you wish. -Aljoschka, I need more bricks! -Come! - All right, Ivan Denisovich. -Where to put it? -Hand me the bucket! There! Oh, what a devil of speed! 17 rows almost done! The 22nd Brigade is already surrendering its tools! Take care of your things! Screw in the lightbulb and wear the grout. We have to move on now! If we don't work the mortar today, it will be as hard as stone tomorrow! You won't even get him out of the trough with a pickaxe! Come on guys! Brigadier! Here's the last batch of mortar. -Do you need him? -No more, we don't have time. Carry it in the corner and pour it out. But throw something on it so you don't see anything. Pavlo! Take Göptschik with you, collect the tools and turn them in. I'll send you four ladles with Kildigs. We're just finishing this. The brigadier's chest is made of steel, the head is clear, the conscience is clear. That's him, the scion of a hard-working kulak family, who in the 1930s was generous with fate scattered across the harsh landscapes of the Northern Urals and Siberia. Not a bad job for half a day without an elevator, -without anything! -People, give the wall trowels to the goepschik! Mine isn't on the list, you don't have to hand it in. I'll finish this! Schukhov, my dear, they shouldn't set you free. What are we supposed to do without you? Let's go! To hell with the mortar. Throw him over the wall! Just go, you are needed more urgently there. Hurry up! What a pity that the working day is so short! When things are going well, it's already over. I'm done. Come on. run! I come! Just one more row. Schukhov, hurry up! Yes, I'm coming! -Oh thank you. -Hurry up! Schukhov! More quickly! -Hello, mother. -Hello. Do you live here? I don't live here, but I come here. Did you hand me the trowel? I must have dropped it while sneezing. Yes. But how? it's so high At least eight meters. Only God knows that. Thank you mother for your help. how warm your hands are Doesn't it get cold in winter without mittens? It will not. Look... Schukhov! -I'll start walking then? -Run, run. You've been called for a long time. Schukhov! May god bless you. And Schukhov ran as fast as he could without looking back. Suddenly he felt an extraordinary surge of inner energy, as if he had eaten enough home cooking and slept well; as if he were twenty years old and still had everything ahead of him. I My soul... 3 2...is in your hands — Unbutton the quilted jackets! The shirts too! Ivan Denisovich, will you do me a favor? Can you queue for me in the parcel room? I'm expecting a package. Schuechow has nothing to hide from the search that day. But after ten years of daily searches caution has become a habit. His hand slipped into his pocket, to check if it was empty. And then there was the saw blade that he had so carelessly picked up in the work area today. If they found it, it would be over. There it was, the punishment cell. And an extended sentence. The next five. -Take off the shoe. -Which? The left. you can go The next five! I thank you sir. Who is the last? I. Good sausage. we keep them Glass containers are prohibited. want a paper bag Then in the hands. I take the paper. It is enough. The next! Zesar Markovich! I guess I can go then? Yes of course. -Shall I get your dinner? - No, Ivan Denisovich, - You can have my food. -Thank you very much. ♪ Artillerymen, Stalin gave you the order! 7 £ Artillerymen, the fatherland is calling us ♪ £ And a hundred thousand battalions ♪ ♪ For the tears of our mothers For our fatherland 3 ♪ Fire, fire! 3 N / A? -How many are you in the brigade? -Delicious. Twenty four. Today... Ivan Denisovich! Please. Not everyone gets such a ration. Some get three hundred grams, others two hundred. Everyone according to their work. That's the law in Brigade 104. - Pjotr ​​Mihalych. -Thanks. No! Nothing is left here! -Good evening. -Good evening. Please come in. Sit down, Ivan Denisovich. You must be exhausted. Oh. What is that? This is the Upper Debin camp. I spent ten years there. Until the head of the camp, Colonel Börschew, brought to the camp here, where I am today. He was transferred here. And I was lucky. The colonel and his wife took a liking to me... You see, I was painting back then by using small photos, such small passport photos, his whole family. The colonel with his wife his mother, father and two brothers, the soldiers were. In the picture they are all seated at a table by the samovar in a lilac garden. And when the couple saw this, Börschew's wife started to cry and he hugged me and said: "You brought our whole family together! In real life we ​​didn't succeed. The elder brother died near Brest, the younger in the Battle of Stalingrad, but I still live and must guard people". Dear Ivan Denisovich. In ten days with God's help you will leave this place. I, lonely old man, am stuck here. I have nowhere to go either. At least I can work here. Your daughters are waiting for you. I want to give you this picture. As a souvenir. -Who is this? -That's them. Didn't you recognize yourself? Not really. It's not a photo. This is a representation of you. Thanks, that wasn't necessary. It comes from the heart.

It's me. Did the men write their statements as they should? -You write. -You should have given them up. But they are uneducated. It takes time. Pens and ink are missing. - Why don't you have any? -Taken away. Listen Brigadier if you babble so much, I'll put you in the cell. I'm already sitting. You go to solitary confinement. And see that until tomorrow all declarations are available in the commander's room. All prohibited items must be listed and reported. -Roger that? -Roger that. Very good. Is the number S-311 in your brigade? I would have to look there. Who can remember all these numbers? Bujnowski, answer! Ah? Here! Do you hear? Number 311 is here and you don't know it. Get ready, Bujnowski! Where? Punishment cell for ten days. -Strict solitary confinement! -He has a fever of forty degrees. He won't survive there. -Who says that? -I! Ah! Schukhov. It is commendable to stand up for your comrade. Very good. But now you're going to the punishment cell for that, for your comrade. Schukhov, to the exit! Take off your hat and jacket. You can keep the scarf. Come on, move. Have mercy, Major. Don't add time. I have daughters in an orphanage. One is pregnant. You need me, Major. Have mercy. Ten days of strict solitary confinement. Forward, Schukhov. Command back! Nine days. -I do not understand. -I said nine! The prisoner Schukhov will need the tenth day to prepare his discharge papers. -Carry out! -At your command! Comrade Colonel. Forward, Schukhov. Brigadier, who was that standing behind him? With the fur hat? This is the camp commander, Colonel Borshev Alexander Ivanovich. Ten days in solitary confinement if you sit them down to the end, means you lose your health for the rest of your life. That means tuberculosis and endless hospital stays. And those who spent fifteen days in solitary confinement are already underground. I thank you, oh Lord. I thank you.
