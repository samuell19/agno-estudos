I've got a large album... where I keep all the plants I collect. What were you singing? And all the flowers too. I'd like to go to Provence... Singing? Certainly not! Do you enjoy being with Mr... uh. Chappardon. No. I wanted to be a genealogist. I started studying law. And you? But I'm rotting away at Chappardon's... Genealogy is fabulous... You can pick an heir at random... and maybe find a fortune for him. And what do you do? I'm from Cholet. Only been here a month. In the afternoons I'm doing an internship at Mr... Beg-your-pardon's! I'm called Caroline... and you? Caroline Nattier... and you? No, not me! My name is Antoi... And what do you want to do? um... not tonight. I'm having dinner with Caroline. This is all really delicious! I'll tell you my job... I'm a genealogist. No way! ...incognito! And... will you be here for a while ? I'm through. I'm leaving tomorrow... 'at early morn'...

Hard to say! Practice makes perfect... Well now, let's see... Faces of the Ardeche, Aubenas and area - I've been... good morning Madam. -Sir. I have been commissioned by someone who wishes to remain anonymous... to look into the possible existence of an illegitimate child. Now in his twilight years, my remorseful client, wants to leave the child something. Oh, sorry, I forgot. Loic Cloarec de Kermedic. Genealogist. Caroline! Telephone! Hello... oh good morning... yes... good... and you... Aubenas? Where's that? yes, here too.. nice weather. You know what? My secretary left me! She's gone! Oh... with an incompetent accountant. To Brest... I think! Quite a story. Yes... No, I've got a lot of work here at the moment... and I'm not a secretary. Yes. Yes I'll try... I'll make an effort to try. Right, that's not much. No, I can't promise any more than that. Goodbye! I've found him! Jacques Levasseur, born February 5, 1925... to Louise Levasseur in Aubenas, father unknown. Louise Levasseur, born on blah...blah... died August 15, 1925. 6 months after the birth of her son. No-one in the town knows Jacques Levasseur. No-one in the area has ever heard of him. Not bad looking, this area! They just remember he was taken by Social Services... and grew up on a farm... in the mountains. That's your man! That's him! I didn't believe you for a moment in Belisle... when you said you were a genealogist. You're young! Your train is leaving in an hour, we should hurry. Are you really a genealogist? Yes, why? I don't like genealogists. Post Office A Post Office box? Yes... in what name? um... Jacques Levasseur. Registrar of births - Aubenas I've lost my identity card. Good morning sir. I'd like a new one. My name is Jacques Levasseur. Here's my birth certificate. Driving School Mr. Levasseur? Here's your licence sir. - Goodbye and thank you. - Goodbye sir. Antoine Chapelot? Oh, that's me! Mr. Antoine Chapelot? Here I am! Are you looking for somewhere to rent? No, I'm looking to buy. I'm looking for...um What are you looking for? A small apartment. A nice one! Certainly sir. Are you intending to live there yourself? No, I'm looking to rent it out. It's an investment... an initial investment in the area... to see how it goes. Allow me sir... Mr. Marcel... could you come here for a moment. Coming! Mr. Marcel is... You'll see that Mr. Marcel is... Mr. Marcel, I'd like to introduce... Jacques Levasseur, Company Director. Thanks my good man. My dear Mr... Levasseur, something tells me that we are going... to do great business together... what do you say? I say, um... well I say... that to rent the place to those damn tourists... coming here only to spend their holidays, maybe there's no need to be picky! Jacques, you're way too harsh! Marcel, lower your price by 30,000 francs... and I'll sign a deal with my eyes closed. 30,000? You're pushing it! Let's say 10,000... because I like you and we can get it over with. 20,000! 15,000! You're killing me old man... Now give me the keys, will you? Private holiday apartment Cannes 5 rooms, everything included 9,000 francs for the season Write J. Levasseur P.O.Box 21 PARIS I'm coming... Hello! No! Yes! Yes! No! No, but... Here's your room. Oh, flowers, how lovely! You've got my mother's room. And your father? He's been dead for ages. Died a hero, my dad! Well, almost... My room's over there. And here's the work I've been talking about, at least just a bit of it. Caroline... we have great things ahead... So tell me what this huge job is! Wow... a prosecutor. He's a prosecutor! No prosecutors... no lawyers, no bailiffs, no police commissioners... They're all crooks! Poor quality writing paper... unsophisticated handwriting... Where does he live? Championnet Street, Paris. Not reliable! Reject it. Real estate agents! The cheeky buggers! Reject it. Does this Jacques Levasseur look like you? Uh... yes... no... why? Cousins often look alike. Not always. Why does he have all his mail sent to a P.O box? It's easier. Who for? O.K. I've finished. Here's the model letter that we'll be sending to everyone we select... on his behalf of course. On whose behalf? My cousin's! First, I describe the apartment. 5 rooms, quite unbelievable, right on the sea. If they like the sound of it, I'll send them the keys... for a deposit of 3,000 francs. That's just one third of the rental, an honest touch. And then we wait for replies. But Antoine... that'll make 100 letters for us to write! Obviously, but that's business. At first a hundred, soon a thousand, you'll see. O.K. let's go eat! Locksmith I'd like 100 like this. Hello sir. Is that possible? Madam, sir... you want... Yes! I'd like... 5 like this. Oh 5... I thought you said 100! 95, 96, 97, 98! 98! Well that's not bad. 98... um... Say something nice to me. uh? Something nice? Yes. ... and sincere? Yes. ... and very personal? Yes. ... and that's not said every day? Yes. I like you too. And now, you know what we're going to do my pet? No. 98 small packets for the keys... and... and fill in 98 cash on delivery forms. Now, try and be good! Do you mind if I call my parents? Of course not! You have Bolivar, General. Bolivar, how are you my friend? Cholet, cabin 3. I would like you to say hello. I'll put him on... it's my mom. Hello, good day Madam. Yes, yes, very nice... yes... goodbye Madam. Hello sir. yes, a very nice girl... That's right. Goodbye. Goodbye Mom and Dad. Hugs and kisses. From me too! - So, are you hungry? - A bit, are you? A bit, are you? A bit, are you? - I'm really hungry! - Me too! We've done some good work! Yep, a really good job! Why aren't you eating? Because I'm happy. And have you often been happy before? Just once. Once upon a time, there was a little girl... fresh from the country, really fresh... who fell in love with a man, not so young, but not that old... right young lady? and... Am I talking nonsense? Caroline hasn't replied but... that doesn't stop her from thinking... She's sad... You are really clumsy sometimes! Goodnight. Goodnight. - Caroline? - Yes? See I'm clumsy too! You want me to help you? No. What do you think of them? They're pretty cute aren't they? Who? My parents. I'm sure Dad liked you very much. Now, off to bed with you... you're tired... You know, it's true they are cute... your parents... So listen to this! Payments received = 267,000... francs! Expenses = 5825 francs. Profit = 261,175 francs. More than 26 million of our old francs! But, even so, we only had 89 replies. In spite of the signed agreements 9 were rude enough to refuse the keys. They didn't keep their word... incredible! But I'm not complaining. Caroline, my dear... there's something I need to tell you. Yes uncle? I'm throwing astronomical numbers out at you and you don't have a clue. Well, you see, in short... I'm not really a genealogist. I'm more like a hardware clerk... and even more like an adventurer. Yes, a risk-taker. that's what I am an adventurer! What do you have to say to that? I never imagined hardware clerk. I was thinking sales rep... Sales rep? Well I wasn't far off! My poor Antoine, do you really think that all you have to do is to put on airs and grease!? no... hairs and graces!? Doesn't matter! You can be pretty dumb my poor Chapelot... You can't see what's right in front of you. I've been going along with you in this thing... let's not mince words, I've been your accomplice, and you're handing me lines I can see right through! 'I'm a genealogist...' 'I'm working with my cousin'... you're full of baloney! we usually say 'full of shit'! What? And if you could see your nose? - My nose? - It moves like a wiper when you lie! So, if you want to get into business... 'Caroline, we have great things ahead...' you've got to learn to control your nose... and to appear less naive and stupid. There you are... I'm done, your turn. Well, you obviously think you're irresistible... but let me tell you something... listen carefully... In this whole thing it's you who's been leading me on. You've been abusing my trust. How does that make me look? What about my male dignity? And that's not all... wh... Are you talking to me? Are you leaving? I won't be taken for a fool so thanks for everything and... sorry about the vase. What vase? The one I broke. But I know you didn't do it on purpose! You know that... do you? And anyway, I don't like adventurers! So, you don't like genealogists, adventurers... All in all, you don't like anyone! Well at least I had the last word! Well done Antoine... You took your time opening up. Well, the door wasn't locked. Do you like it? Sure do... but where are your things? I didn't take them with me. Then why did you take the case? To go shopping. And what did you do afterwards? Do you really like it? Yes, really, a lot. Please don't laugh, I waited. Where? On the stairs. Waited for what? For the right time. What time? To put it on, like you waited to put your pyjamas on... do you love me... Forget it, I didn't say anything, absolutely not. And I absolutely didn't kiss you. So... what's your preference... your room or mine? So? Nothing! As if I didn't do anything! As if we... Of course, if I had killed a couple of guys... It's a shame! Don't you think it's better like this? What does it matter since it's not me... Jacques Levasseur... don't know him... nobody knows him. Nothing... not a word... Green light for setting up new red lights in Paris That's interesting but that's not it. They think we're bananas! I'd rather say we're beets. Beets? Make no sense! It means we're bananas. That's what I said! Hardware store When I think of those 98 people... no, not people... 98 families arriving at Cannes with their keys... I'd like to have been there. We would have seen the sea... Come on! I've got an idea... No! I've got another idea... Come on! This is our 149 franc model. You must be joking! Yes... no sir. Here is our model at 221.95 Mr. Edgar! You can't be serious! No... yes... wait... This one is 334 francs. That's more like it... 334 francs! It's gone up though! Last week. This one's scratched! Find me a perfect one... Ah Mr. Masserand... Hello Chapelot. Dear Mr. Masserand, I have... good day, I have the distinct pleasure of informing you that... I now consider myself to be permanently on holiday. Caroline, my little inheritance and myself, we can now say... Goodbye hardware store! Behave yourself please! What are you thinking about? The future. I'm looking for... - Do you love me? - Yes. Didn't hear you! - Yes! - Right. How do you love me? A lot. Not good enough, we'll start again. do you love me ...yes. How... How do you love me? Sitting on a folding stool, comma, fishing, full stop. New line. Fishing line, ha! Am I annoying you? Just say so old Tony, I'm annoying you... with all my questions. OK. For fun... I'll ask you a question I've never asked before... Am I your sweetheart? Obviously I'm stupid. I, Caroline Natier, native of Cholet, am obviously not your sweetheart. You may well love me, but not in the right way. I'm your 'un-sweetheart'. You're thinking about something else. Yes. Come here. Take off your glasses. Now you behave yourself! Or Uncle Nenesse will kill you with his big knife. Where were we? Too bad! We must start at the beginning again! Come in! Will you go downstairs! Or should I call Uncle Nenesse? Good morning, hope you slept well. Who is this terrible Nenesse everybody's talking about? Ernest Forelon, the uncle from America. Well not really I guess since Guyana isn't really America. Guyana? Good morning Madam. Was he a convict? Sure, and a local too. Can you imagine? - It seems that... - Telephone! Oh, I don't have time, have to dash. But if you're really interested, a real Forelon could tell you a lot more than I could. One runs that newspaper... Robert Forelon! Bon appetit! Handed to us on a plate! Just like always. You're lucky I'm here! Hustling? No. Disappearing? No. Ranting? Gossiping? You're getting warm... Soup-making? No. Blackmailing! They're all called Forelon here! It gets more and more interesting... Regional Gazette It'll look more serious if you go in alone. You're right. What are you going to do? Visit the town. Your beard really suits you. Take off your glasses! You and your pornographic ideas! Director and Editor in Chief Mr Marolais? At first your name didn't mean anything to me... but of course Jean Marolais! What an honour to welcome an internationally known reporter... to this humble newspaper. But of course Jean Marolais! It's such a big deal! Come on Forelon, my time's precious. Let's fish or cut bait! Oh, spoken like a true journalist! It's like I always say... No blah, blah... short sentences, hard-hitting facts! This time out, my inquiry just deals with France. With the provinces, to be precise. Provincial France! Yes, what a source of... To be even more precise, with eccentric characters who deserve to be better known. And rightly so! You know, at 20 my dream... was to go up to Paris. But with no connections, how... So, here's my headline colon: 'Uncle Nenesse' Large font, front page... So... he treated the children that badly! No, not at all... but there was the girl from Paris. you know Mr. Marolais... I'm nearly 40 and my dream is to get into... Firstly, Ernest 'Nenesse' Forelon. Secondly, the Parisian girl. That's right... a big Paris newspaper. - There's no future here. And then? Attacked by those four mad girls... Whose girls? The Parisian's, like I just said. They were insanely jealous of their mother. Nenesse only owed his safety to a large knife... Oh, we've finally got to the knife! Yeah, right... You know Mr. Marolais, I'm not greedy. To start with a little job as assistant editor... And then..? And then... Nenesse fled... but it didn't take long for the cops to find him. Then there was the trial... The verdict? Condemned to death and... Ah!! commuted to life. The 1814 presidential election. The Penal Colony in Guyana... That's right. Now with your connections..... Stick to the point! - Escaped. - In? And after that? No idea. Dead? Made a new life for himself ? He disappeared! And how do you feel about having a great uncle who's a murderer. Well, if we were just a few... but around here there's a whole gang of Forelons! Nenesse comes in handy to calm down kids. Exactly! So, with a little help on your part... I'll send you the article. Thanks and Goodbye! Blackmailing? Much better than that! Fiddling? Boating? Sharing? You're getting warm... Inheriting! Levasseur's cover is blown. I need another. What would you say to a little trip to Auvergne? I'd love it... On your own! Why? I've got stuff to do here. What? Look for an office. And you're really good at research, aren't you Capucine? Austerlitz train station! Did you find something? And you, did you miss me? Yes. So? Truly, aren't you glad that I'm back? Yes! Well then, it was worth leaving just to hear that. Oh, your beard! Camouflage... look! What's my name? Office of Jacques Pons Mr. Pons, telephone! Hello, yes? Do you love me? What do you love about me? Really Mademoiselle! Let's say your little ears. And how about my neck? Really Miss Pinson! I've complimented your neck about a thousand times! Come on, say it one more time and I won't ask you again... for a little while! America's a long way off The American System of Government Come on, it's just about time. Gone with the Wind 'Uncle Tom's cabin'? Because of 'uncle'. Posse And now, what would you like? To see 'Gone with the wind' again. Right, all done! I'm ready! Really ready? Yes, all we have to do is rent a car. A car? An American one... a huge one... a black one... with a chauffeur. Black? No, white. And we're ready to go! What are you doing? I'm looking for a fall guy. What's more, I think I've already found him. Not worth looking for anyone better... the Deputy Mayor, Albert Forelon. Wow, like my uncle! - Your uncle? - Yep, Uncle Albert. Is he Deputy Mayor? No, simply Uncle Albert was called Albert! Why aren't you laughing? Because there's a problem... The media. If those idiots talk to the newspapers all is lost! Why? Because an enquiry would show that it's all baloney! You're full of baloney! Why aren't you laughing? Because there's another problem. The amount! One billion isn't enough, but more could be over the top. No. A dozen billion would be totally reasonable... Why are you laughing? I can't wait for tomorrow! Why aren't you laughing? Why are you laughing? Town Hall Jacques Pons Representing Higgins & Higgins Fine. This is rather unusual... Fine. It's perfectly clear. You have been commissioned by this American law firm... Higgins & Higgins to search out heirs for a Mr. Forelson. Fine. So far, fine. But, and I say again 'but', what could have made these lawyers think, from Texas, that this Forelson... who died with his wife, leaving no heirs, in an airplane crash... was in fact the son of Ernest Forelon, ex-convict, let's not mince words. I give you the floor. Thank you, honourable Deputy Mayor. And I'll answer: It's obvious. It's evident that my employers, who have one of the oldest and most important law firms in Dallas, had dealt with the last will of Ernest Forelon, who was seeking his fortune in Texas as Mr Forelson... Forelon/Forelson get it? ...before taking care of his son's affairs. Ah, yes, of course. And according to this law firm, this fortune amounts to... how much? From what I know, it would be about... 15 billion or so... of our old francs. A good amount for Americans but not at all exceptional. Right Miss Pinson? Not at all. Of course. Not at all. But... But... All of this is worth thinking about... Mr. Pons... and I think we could talk more comfortably over dinner. Right then, I've managed to get hold of Etienne Forelon, the Notary... and Robert Forelon, our local journalist. I've given them an idea of what's up... fine. Dinner at my place. Do you like our local cooking, Mr. Pons? Do you like Bourbon, Mr. Forelon? I brought it back from my last trip to the States. Do you often go to the States? No, not really, about 3 times a year. Last year, it was only twice. Ah, here's Robert. Good evening. Please don't get up. Over here Robert. Mr. Pons... - His secretary. - Miss Pinson. This story is going to cause quite a stir! Robert! Let's be crystal clear. It absolutely must not cause a stir. Mum's the word in newspapers. Fine! Wouldn't you say so Etienne? Well, as a Notary... I'm a Notary... I understand discretion. Fine! And anyway my dear Albert, what if your electors... were to find out that you are the heir of a billionaire! Etienne! My dear Helene, your terrine is... quite good. Quite, really. A little salty perhaps... Funny that... about two months ago I had a visitor... Yes... Fine. So? No, it's nothing to do with anything. I'm talking nonsense. He said it himself! You were saying? I was saying, before.. um... arrival, that we shouldn't get too excited. Forelon's heirs shouldn't think they'll be billionaires overnight. That's good wisdom! Right? Fine! Why's that then, if you don't mind my asking? Really! Dear? First of all there's a whole bunch of formalities to deal with. Quite so! As a Notary, I know that! - Of course! Robert! Right? Fine. And if every heir were to inherit a sum of any consequence, he'll have to pay a little money. - Well done! - Not sure... But of course. No, you see what worries me... my dear Mr. Pons, is that there's a whole flock of Forelons! Don't you worry, there's enough for everyone. Naturally and in order to assess our basic options... following my normal straight and narrow path... The elections are over dear... Time for the discussions to be put to bed. I was going to say 'to hit the sack'. Just you wait for the next elections and you'll see my campaign! And you bastard, your rag of a newspaper will have to support me. Not on your life! You want to bet? Gentlemen please, there's a lady present. A young lady. Etienne? Don't I count? Not any more! My dear Helene... Shut up Etienne! At some point they'll have to listen to me. A Notary could be useful! We're getting off track! How did good old Ernest make his fortune? In oil. One fine day, in his garden, and maybe it was a sunny day... pshhhh! Well then, I raise my glass to... Robert, Right? Fine. Later. Anyway, shhh.... Fine! Let's get practical. Among our basic options... - You've already said that... - And he is not the first... One: We'll seek out all the Forelons. I'll take care of that at the town hall once it's closed. Better be cautious. Two: You will put discrete ads... in the local papers claiming... (do you love me?) in the local papers claiming... to be searching for long-lost cousins or something. Three: As soon as the list's complete... - we'll get hold of Mr. Pons. - And I'll get hold of Dallas! Perfect! Excellent planning! Finally four: I raise my glass... to good old uncle Nenesse! You cannot understand. Just an little nickname. You know, I'm not going to stay and rot here very long... Me neither! First round to me! Tell me Joseph, you've driven so many Americans around, ever come across an Ernest Forelson? Yeah that name seems familiar. - What business was he in? - Oil! You know, I just might have.... Thanks Joseph! My nose is itchy. It means someone wants to kiss me. - Is it you? - Yes Miss! Here's your kiss offered by the Hardware Clerks Association. And another one from the Reformed Clerks Associations. - Reformed to what? - Kiss and cuddle. correction: Cuddle and kiss! End of the scene! Cut! No don't cut! Why? My nose is still itchy! All we have to do is wait... Let's go out. It's a nice day. What about the phone? It's not going to ring right away. Why not? It rings when it wants! See, you just have to concentrate... Don't you think that you should... Hello, Jacques Pons' Office. Oh good morning sir. (Mr. Forelon, the Notary) Already! You'd like to meet with Mr. Pons tomorrow morning.. Tomorrow evening, late, invent something... I'm so sorry sir. Mr. Pons has a very busy day tomorrow. A conference from 9 'til noon, a business lunch, meetings all afternoon... shall we say 8 p.m.? Perfect, I've put you in at 8. Goodbye sir. Mr. Pons will be delighted! Right! Do they have second thoughts? Notaries are suspicious. Remember Chappardon... Yes right! They want to see what a Pons' office looks like. Or even if there is a Pons' office! So we'll show him, won't we my little bird? Mr. Forelon is here. Please take a seat sir. My dear Mr. Forelon, you're lucky. My last client just left. - It's very good of you... - Joseph, the car please. - Well, I had the opportunity... - Please, come right in.. - I... - Will you please call the elevator. - What's his name? - Just call him nicely. And you'll see he'll come. An old maid... but an excellent secretary! Caroline! All's well! I told him that I had a board meeting tomorrow morning... and Joseph assured me that he would have fun! How about you? Me? I've been laughing my head off... Sorry, laughing like a beheaded old maid! come on, you asked for it! Why... I'm pissed off when you bow and scrape! My little chickadee you know I couldn't take you with us! Perhaps, but it pisses me off anyway! Come on! Here's all the bills. - Did he catch his train? - Just! - Was he happy? - Very happy! Thanks a lot Joseph. See you soon. 3 or 4 days? More like 3 or 4 weeks Same destination? The same. They're all here! 260! Not including wives, children and animals. Officially, it's just a family reunion. Here's Alfred Forelon who kindly let us use his property. Thanks again Alfred. Think nothing of it! So you're the... - Heaven-sent messenger! - Ant... Jacques Pons. I'm pleased. Nice property! Some hard work... So, when's it going to be? Three o'clock. It's going to be difficult to pull everyone together. Let's go! Come on... Be quiet please! Please, my friends! Right? Fine! Oh, here come the missing three. Thanks Alfred! OK then let's get going. I declare this session... Louder! I declare this session... Can't hear you! Open! Hurrah for Pons! Mr. Pons has the floor. Ladies and Gentlemen. As you know, its an inheritance of more than 14 billion old francs.. left to you by son of Ernest Forelon, your dear uncle Nenesse. Hurrah for our uncle! Hurrah for Mr. Pons! If we divide these 14 billion by 260, that's how many you are, that makes 55 million for each one of you! Still talking old francs! However, I have to warn you. French and American Revenue Agencies won't see things the same way. There's strength in numbers! it is urgent, and essential... that you stay together on this... and form an association. Each of you putting in an equal amount of money. Don't worry, it's not a very large sum! My American counterparts said that $20,000 would be enough. Divided by 260 that would make a personal contribution of 400 francs. Old francs? No, new francs! Got to be clear! You'll agree with me that it is a very small amount... compared to the share of the inheritance which each one of you will get, roughly 250,000 francs! New ones! It costs more than betting at the track. More of a sure thing though. Those who want to inherit have to pay 400 francs! And Mr. Pons, will be our contact with the Americans. As for the others... Right? Fine! - How much time at Caracas? - Two years, then America. - Texas? - No, California. Texas, later. So, 10 million is good. Money honestly earned! But there were 260 of them, so let be honest, it's not good. 400 francs a head, that's... - Miserable! - Right! Ridiculous! Pathetic! Not a single one refused... they all paid up. Seeing their greed is... - Incredible? - What? - Insane? - No, no! Insufficient! I'm a very long way from having got all I can out of them. So, listen to me. We're going on the attack! They are a real gold mine! We just can't let them off like that! - We run with the hare and ride with... - The hounds! See? You agree with me! Right, got it! Suspense! We'll make them sweat! They'll be dripping! And believe me they'll pay up! Good night! My pet... What's better than money! James Hadley Chase Interesting author! Fly Away Pigeon D. & B. Hitchens What if... instead of a banal airplane accident due to mechanical failure... where they died together... now only ashes... What if Forelson committed suicide. Why? Overworked. They always are. Stressed out, facing ruin... Fly away inheritance! Quite an interesting development! And here's another thing... what if Forelson's wife... Elizabeth! No, Barbara! ....had been a former nightclub hostess. She planned her husband's murder to inherit. So American! - Are you listening? - So American... OK. But because of a botched execution... Are you listening? A botched execution. It happens all the time! The bad guys meet the same fate as their victims... And we're back to square one! Niagara Falls. How about if Barbara had been married before. She had a daughter from her first marriage... Jessica! Such a nice name Jessica. Jessica went to Higgins & Higgins... with the help of her lawyer... Malcolm Campbell... a twisted man, very twisted... and she has claimed the Forelson inheritance. Yes! That was my idea! Forelson, overworked, had a heart attack in his airplane... and he died first! Barbara was the last to die, so Jessica is the only heir. True! But where does that get us? Higgins & Higgins want to know if the French heirs of Forelson... are prepared to defend their interests against Jessica. True! We just received the letter... tomorrow morning... - You think they'll go for it? - The Forelons? Guaranteed! Provincial folks always love a good fight. Do you love me? - Sure. Is there a night train for Briancon? We'll plead the case Mr. Pons! A fine thing it would be if the Americans were to get the better of us! Please tell that to to Higgins & Higgins. And I'll call an urgent meeting with the heirs. Absent ones will sign a mandate. This woman is a gangster! This Jessica what's-her-name... wants to see us starve! But we won't let it happen! Hurrah! Long live France!! - How's it going Miss Pinson? - Very well Mr. Pons! - Pinch and Punch are in a boat... - Pinch falls... Silence! Silence, Miss I-know-it-all. Mr. Pons has the floor. Just to clarify a few things. We are definitely going to plead this. But, if I can be give you some advice... let's consolidate our case. - What if this Jessica, um... - Wilson! Wilson, step-daughter of Forelson, manages to prove her case for the inheritance? We will lose the trial and will have to pay the costs. With some expert's audit report we will know where we are going! Ladies and gentlemen, we need experts not only competent but... um... accommodating! And the more accommodating experts are, the more it will cost us. I think you understand what I'm getting at... Did you see? Really! How quickly they paid 500 francs? The time has come to hit them hard and get out. So, our pricey experts... will get together the proof that Forelson died after his wife. Because of his strong constitution... You got that right! Forelson was a mighty force! Are you? So, the French Forelons are the sole heirs. No problems at the trial, they are sure to win. But they'll find out that a trial costs a lot in America! Lawyers fees and retainers, bribes... I want... not to mention what's already been spent: The investigations into Jessica and her dodgy lawyer. Private detectives cost a fortune these days! Then there's Higgins & Higgins' fees! And mine! And all the phone costs between Paris and Dallas! Don't forget that! - They mount up over time! I won't forget. Do you know what... this time, I'm going all out. - What do you say? - My nose is itchy. Where? There? No... - Oh no! - What? The Notary and the Deputy want to see me at once. A really bad sign just 10 days before the general meeting. It's 11 days... Get me Briancon on the phone! Certainly sir! This should stay strictly between us. Right? Fine. There are some worrying things going on here. You know about small towns, ambition, family disagreements... The trouble with the selfishness of some people. In short, our cousin... The owner of the Gazette... Who you know... ... is blackmailing them, the little piece of shit! He wants to transform his little rag into an regional daily paper. What's the problem? Well, he's counting on all the Forelon heirs to finance it. It's rosemary herbal tea, really good for your health. - But I'm not sick! - Drink. And if the Forelons refuse? He's going to let the media know where the inheritance comes from. escaped convict... not very honourable! Tough... He's given them a month to finance his newspaper. And that's our saving grace! In a month we'll be far away. Provence, right? Just wait for my herbal teas... Does your camera work? Yes, why? I had an idea on the train! Oh what's this? It's my birthday. Really? How many candles? 22? But surely you're not that old! I am! You want me to tell you how it's going to work? This time it will be a little less pleasant. They still believe in the billions but it's been going on for too long. So, when the Deputy... Right? Fine! announces that for the trial to start, each one has to pay 5,000 new francs... icy silence will fall over the audience. I'd like a chocolate ice... Then the boldest among them will get riled up, they'll rile up the others and there'll be a right dust-up... in Alfred's barn. - I think I'd prefer the field. - Could be in the field. Or up the creek! There's still time to back out, please Antoine! No, because you see, I'll get up and I'll talk to them. - Will they listen to you? - Of course! Because it's simple: It's only 2% of the 250,000 francs they'll get. For 25 billion old francs, one must be reasonable. Where is Joseph, can you see him? All right! If that's the way it is I'm out of here! Goodbye. I told you so! Morons! - Does the future look good to you? - looking bright! Now, we have to... My friends, I propose... - Let me speak! - No, let me finish! - I know what to say to them! - Me too! Right? Fine! Listen to me! If in 2 weeks... - 2 weeks max! You haven't... - Later Robert! My friends... Fine! I'm giving the floor to Mr. Forelon. Let's give Mr. Forelon a hand. - What did you want to say? - The Notary is not stupid... He understood! The rich will buy up the shares of the poor. - Very bright! - You'll see... - Why are they booing them? - Because they're the losers. They've just paid them back what they had paid out. But, just watch how the others will fight. - 12 million each share... -10 million! 11 ! I didn't have to show these. It's better that way! - But it's Jessica! - It's still better! Ah! Very important! You must give me all those stamps from America! With all that mail you get... my son is bugging me! - Hey? What? - Fine! Mr. Pons promised them to my nephew! A promise is a promise! Right? All right then. We'll go ahead with the trial... and as a deposit, you'll all pay me 5000 francs per share. That's a wise decision. 8 shares - 40,000 francs. 5 shares - 25,000 11 shares - 55,000 My own share 5,000 francs. You know how much your own share is? 1,300,000 you devil! New francs, I know!! All this is really good! But the money's not in our pockets yet! Who's going to take the money to America? - You of course! - Of course! But not on your own! For a trial that important, We'd better be on the spot! I think so too. How would you like a little trip to Broadway? Oh hush your mouth! After all, we don't know Higgins & Higgins from Adam! All right, if you insist! I'll go to America with Mr. Pons. It's going to be hard to knock him out. It's not possible on the plane, we'd need 2 parachutes. Has to be before that then! Beforehand we won't have time to... I have an idea! I have to leave for the States tomorrow. All alone on the boat... it's so sad... While I think of it... It might be wise to deposit the cheque in the ship's safe. Would you come with me to see the purser? If you think so. All right. Let's go! Careful! Very valuable! Right? Fine! I'm going to get freshened up. See you at the bar in 1 hour. Sorry but I don't do very well during the first 24 hours on board. So, I'd better get some rest in my cabin. Don't worry if you don't see me at lunch or dinner. I'll be fine by tomorrow! And... take good care of our weeping beauty! How do I look? Stunning! Can't you see where you're going! Shut up, he was blind! Blind but not deaf! He could have answered. 1,300,000 francs Etienne Forelon cheque endorsement Jacques Pons Plus this one on my account. All right. 200,000 francs Jacques Pons An urgent payment... Passenger disappears at sea You haven't used your driving licenses much. You can't predict everything! I didn't predict Joseph! I can drive when you're tired if you like. You'll see how pretty it is around Contentin. I used to spend my holidays there at my grandmother's house. Jacques Pons, the passenger who disappeared, Was he a crook? To find out, the envelope he left in the ship's safe needs to be opened. The cheque for 130 million has been cashed! Antoine... my nose is itching. Well scratch it then! I like to see you happy. You're really happy because this time, you're in the paper. It's fame Antoine. That's exactly why I have to kill myself. - You? - Yes! Well... Jacques Pons. No more Contentin! Oh! Dear Public Prosecutor, By the time you receive this letter, I will have paid for my sins and my broken body... So? In 'Sleeper's Bay', at 8:30 p.m. Jacques Pons died. Good! Not a very nice man! Got the newspapers? Civil war in a rural district between family members. the 250 heirs of the fabulous, imaginary fortune of Forelon... are accusing one another of fraud. The Deputy Mayor has had to resign. Notary Forelon's office has been vandalized. Poor Etienne, he was the kindest... - Give me the wheel! - You have no license! I have Jacques Levasseur's. - I didn't throw it out. - Oh! That old key caper is far behind us now. Come on! Driving is not for girls anyway! You're right! In particular at night. - I'm always right! - No, I am! You're right only when you agree with me! It's so nice of you to take me to Provence. Mind you, I would have gladly stayed on the boat. Me too... full of rich people. I can't stop thinking about it! Oh no, you're not going to start again. Oh yes I am. But this time, it will be a classic. Imagine... the two of us on a boat. I'm there... No, Let's start at the beginning. I'm going to buy you a ring. - No!? - Yes, a beautiful one. And then I'll make a perfect fake copy of it. But we keep the other one... You'll wander around, showing it off. Leave that to me! One day, a fine gentleman... eagerly introduces himself. - And so on... - And so forth... And wham! The ring! My dear lady, what a wonderful ring you have there! I express my pleasure, so do you... - Me too? - You too! He insists, a ring like that is worth around 50 million. Right dear chap, I paid 75 for it! so I laugh, you laugh... - Me too? - You too! Ah! A ring that's worth no more than 50,000 old francs! What!? And the guy, who knows his stuff... You bet... I checked... But I assure you dear sir, 50 million! So for fun, pretending to get cross: You're dreaming! I paid 50,000 francs for it. 50 million! And then one fine morning... or fine evening... - Make up your mind! - One fine afternoon... just as we're about to arrive at our destination... - Where? - Wherever you like! Let me think... The longed-for little phrase... I'll offer you 50 million for it! Just like that, on a whim! - 50 million!? - Yes sir. - For this ring worth 50,000 francs? - Yes sir. Did you hear that Capucine? It's been so long since you called me Capucine. You're witnesses right? Put it there! The cheque first! But you lose 25 million!? Just wait... But this is a fake! That's what I've been telling you all along! You need to know what you want my friend! I get it now! That day I was wearing the fake one! And what could he say? Nothing! You're a quick study Marguerite! Isn't that right Dr. Faust? I'd be surprised if someone found the money in there. Oh Antoine, we could stay here for ever... together with a whole bunch of little lambs! Close your eyes. Close your nose. Close your ears. Open your mouth. All that's fine but there's nothing to eat! What would you say to a picnic... a really great picnic! Tonight, in the moonlight... Oh yes! You go shopping while I unpack! At your service Ma'am! Driver's licence? Well, well... Look at that! I would really like to know Inspector, why this silly mistake, this mere trifle, this momentary lack of attention deserves this treatment! It's real simple, Mr Levasseur. I'm arresting you for the murder... of Alphonsine Duret, your employer. You're done Levasseur! But... since it's obvious, dear sir... that you are not the shepherd Jacques Levasseur... even though everything fits, date and place of birth, etc... Good work, bravo! I would simply like to ask you this: who are you Mr. ex-Levasseur! Levasseur... Levasseur! Exemplary youth! Impeccable family! Model employee! Father died a hero... mother... terrible twist of fate... Such a good little boy, so handsome... so honest! We'll stop this litany right here your Honour. Let's shed a tear for this victim of our troubled society. Let's pardon our little lost sheep who's been so silly, so thoughtless and... when all is said and done, so irresponsible. Because, after all your Honour, I think you will agree with me... that this stupid key business, this stupid little prank... Stupid little prank!!! It brought me in 26 million... this stupid key business. And remember that business of the Forelon heirs... was that a stupid prank too? Yes, your Honour, you know who was behind the Forelon affair? It was me! And you know how much that brought in? 150 million! Is that enough, dear sir? Silence in court! Do you know what this little joke is going to cost you? At least 10 more years! Congratulations! It was worth it. And it was time to stop anyway. So now it's come to an end... rather brilliantly I think! I'd like a ticket please. Where to? A long way away. Antoine, At first I was really upset about the stupid thing you did. But you really couldn't help yourself. You just wanted to play at being important... or just simply to play. And then I realized that it was all just fine... since it let you reclaim your childhood innocence. I'm leaving with the money. I'll try to spend it wisely... thinking about you, my little fifty-year old hardware clerk. Forty! Hold on! Forty-year old... That poor Caroline never could count! I'll try to be happy too. Thank you for everything you taught me Antoine. Thanks for everything. Goodbye Antoine. Scripting and proofreading: Nocturne Adaptation and subtitling: LeMaudit
