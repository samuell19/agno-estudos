(whooshing) (sustained tone) (music playing) - Woman:You okay? - Man:Yeah, I'm fine. The door doesn't like me. Oh. Do you want something to eat? Uh, okay, sure. There's a dog in your house. I know. Isn't he adorable? No, I mean, there's more things in the door of my fridge than in my fridge. Doesn't it, like, rattle when you open it and make a lot of noise? You focus on the weirdest things. - I know, I know. (gasps) -(dog barks) (kissing) You're thinking about it. You're thinking about loving me. Maybe-- no. All right. Start with the first one, we'll see how long... There's a guy, his name's Marty McFly. Marty McFly, yeah. And he's best friends with a... a disgraced nuclear physicist. (laughs) This dog should be named "Einstein." - Why? - Because he looks like Albert Einstein. I guess so. He's got the hair, he's got the moustache, he's got that Swedish accent. - (both laugh) - What? Have you heard him talk? He's talked to you. Yeah, he-- yup. And what did he say? (as Albert Einstein): "God does not roll dice." (laughing): Stop. Oh, man. (music playing) This is whose room? My parents. Parents? Their bedroom? - Yeah. - It's so nice. It's so nice in here, right? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Yeah, your parents'... bedroom. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Uh... - (cap lands on floor) - Oops. And... my hat fell off. My bad. - You... - It's not going to happen. - Why can't you...? - Mm-hmm. Uh, so that's what's happening. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? - Maybe. - Oh. Is that okay? - Yeah, fine. - Mm-hmm. - Totally fine. - (laughs) I was so worried... (kiss) that you were gonna knee me... (kiss) right in the balls. - (both laugh) - I'm so happy I didn't. (inhales) (music playing) (waves crashing) (music playing) (no audible dialogue) Martin: No, you're right. (chuckles) Hey! - Hey, guys, - Martin: There he is. How was, uh... how was your night? Uh... good. Yeah, fine, good. My daughter behave herself? - Sure. Sure, yeah. - Oh, good. Good. That's good. I... just get so worried about her, you know? (soft chuckle) Think of the trouble she's capable of getting herself into. Yeah. - So... - So, uh... she still sleeping? Uh... not exactly. W-- wait. What the fuck do you mean, "not exactly"? She's, um... she's not... present. (music playing) Colder than arrows Shot in the dark She said Lays you down sideways And walks out the door She's leaving you lonely You'll always want more How... Can it be? -Can you see it. - (song ends abruptly) This is Chris. Woman (over phone):Uh... where the hell did you go? We need your 5D to take the rest of the photos. Oh, uh... (chuckles) Listen, I've been on that site all day and I've certainly put in more hours on this project than anybody, so, I just-- Woman: I don't give a shit. Just turn around and come back, you're not done. Are you guys gonna finally pay me, then? (woman sighs) You know what? We'll use someone else's camera, all right? We can take it from here, but there's no promises if we're bringing you back next week. (beep) Perfect. (music playing) (emergency brake cranks) Where is he? He's at... right here, right now. (exhales) Whoa! (squeals) (laughs) Whoa, jeez! Brooklyn: Nina Simone documentary. Have you seen that? Crazy. I just like when she's doing her comeback or whatever and someone gets up and she's like... (quietly): "Sit down." (laughs) Amazing. What is this? It's a picture. It's this low-budget, action superhero thing that I worked on. They hired me to take pictures of behind the scenes and stuff. It was pretty fun. It was called "The Henchmen." What's a henchman? What's a hench-- henchmen are the bad guys that the bad guy hires. (laughs) Fuck. - No. - Okay. Don't make fun of that, okay? That was pretty important because that's the only paycheck I made last month, so, to me, that little movie was like "Deer Hunter." Yeah, no, it's... it's good. Like, you're getting better... - for an amateur. - Well... Like a really mediocre amateur. Let's remember that in high school I was voted "Boy least likely to exceed expectations." - (laughs) - So I'm living up to that. I missed this. Yeah, I could take it or leave it. But seriously, though, why... why did you come back? 'Cause I thought when you left, you were, like, gone forever. No one told me you came back. (sighs) Yeah, I kind of kept it on the DL. Yeah, but why? Where's your mom? I really wanted to see her. (soft chuckle) Yeah, you've been... you've been away, haven't you? - Did they separate? - Uh, no. Okay, you know what? We don't have to talk about it. I feel it getting really heavy Let's just leave it alone. How long has it been since I've seen you? I mean, you've had enough time to grow this... thing. Thing? You don't like this? (laughs) No. Oh, I thought it was-- I guess it's been since that party. Been about two years, you know? And I-- I'm sorry that I didn't go with you guys or follow you around Europe like we talked about. But think about it, me, you, your boyfriend... it'd be weird. You weren't supposed to follow us. Just a visit... would've been nice. You have to get over your fear of the ocean or flying over it, or whatever you're hung up on. No, no, no, thalassophobia is real, okay? Plus... I don't really like fish. You're just like my parents. The border is literally right there. Just go look at it. Wait a minute, your dad's from Boston. - This isn't a quiz. - Mm. I finally convinced my parents to go on a trip. Oh, that's good. That's nice, yeah, sure. So what cultural landmark - are you subjecting them to? - (typing on phone) Fucking Cancun, bitches! - Ah, no, that's great, it's beautiful, of course. - They treat... New Year's Eve like V-Day. Wait a minute, you're going with your parents? - Mm-hmm. - You're going on another trip? You just got back from globetrotting, okay? Why don't you just chill out? Mm... no. And... I don't want to go alone. Then take your boyfriend. I would. If I had one. James moved to Oslo without me. And I'm fucking sick of windmills. I think you're thinking of two different... places. Do you have a girlfriend? - That's a no. - What? Okay, that settles it, then. That's why I came over. I really want you to come to Cancun. What? I'm going out west in the spring for school, so this is kind of like... (clicks tongue) you know, my last hurrah. And it can be just like old times. We can rekindle our beautiful friendship. Wait, you're moving away again? I hung out with snubbed-nosed monkeys in the wild! You can't just sit still when there's stuff like that out in the world. Yeah, um... there's no way I can go. I mean, there's just no way I can afford it. I've been looking at these numbers, you know, for months. I'm in the red with all my student loans. - Who cares? - I care. You live at home, you're not gonna die. And it'll be worth every penny, I promise. And this is my way of saying goodbye to my sheltered parents. (sighs) I experienced crowded trains, and hostels all throughout Asia. And when James wasn't screaming at me and I had a quiet moment, I thought a lot about this place. And you. Isn't that the most adorable thing you ever heard? (chuckles) Okay, it's great. And, listen, it's too bad that you feel like you always have to do this. I mean... why don't you just focus on staying put for a while. You know? Stop trying to live off the grid. I mean... it's a shame that there's nothing here that makes you want to stick around. Ugh. But I think maybe-- maybe you should. Well... (inhales deeply) maybe. Maybe if there was someone who traded in their parka for a sombrero, then I would be Whistling Dixie right about now. I can't go! - I can't! - Just say yes! (hits guitar strings) Sí. Sí, amigo, sí. You are a horse's ass. Oh, great, here we go. Dad, help me out. Explain to this dunce over here why even considering this trip is ten bags of fucked. Relax, Michelle, he's not going, that's not his style. Am I right or am I wrong, son? Why is Brooklyn even back in town anyways? Did she tell you? Uh, yeah, apparently she's on the run from the mob, - so... - Fuck you. This makes no sense. What girl invites her guy friend on an all-inclusive vacation with her family for New Year's in Mexico? That's messed up. Maybe she's just a really nice person. Ew! Gross! You're a bigger dandy than I am. Well, no one's arguing that. And stop making your best friends chicks, okay? That's how you dry up a fucking vag. - Christ! - Hey, I got a PhD in slamming clams, bruh! - I think I know. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Look, is Jorah Mormont from "Game of Thrones" your idol or something? - I don't know who that is. - Follows around Khaleesi. You know. You fucking watch the show. God. Why do you let her talk to me like this? I don't know. Michelle: Like, why? Why do this to yourself? What? Oh, listen, I haven't even responded in, like, a week. So nothing's booked yet. You felt something in your loins when you saw her today, didn't you? No. Just relax, okay? No, I didn't-- well, maybe. Okay, so, yeah, so what? So maybe I did. Listen, I don't see this girl for two fucking years, then all of a sudden, boom! There she is again right in my face forcing me to deal with whatever it is I got going on with her all over again! I mean, I thought I'd come a long way from this, but, clearly... no, I haven't. Look, I hear you. I do, but you can't go on this trip. Fucking no, you just can't. Listen, I know what you think. You think that you do one deed for this girl, and all of a sudden, everything's gonna change. You're gonna run away together, you're gonna fuck like criminals, and that's it, happy ever after. That's fucking bullshit! You fucking know that that's bullshit, and you know it. When it comes to love... I know. When it comes to love, I know. - When it comes to love... - Mm. - When it comes to love... - You know? I know. Can I finish? Can I? You just got to find somebody that, at the end of the day, you can be happy with. Somebody you can stand, based in reality. Someone you can just share a bank account with, right? - Unlike my fucking ex-wife, that bitch! - Oh, okay. (phone vibrates) (door opens) (music playing) (no audible dialogue) (plane engine roaring) - (beep) -Holas, amigas. We're minutes away from boarding our plane. Just, so, uh... - What the fuck? - (laughs) - It's like, uh... - Mr. Baker... - What channel are we on? - No, this is Periscope, sir. It's the fucking internet, Dad. This is my father, carbon dating sets his birth year at 27 B.C. All right, that's enough, you two. So, like, you get cable with that? - (scoffs) - No. (music playing) Brooklyn: Hey, can, um... you call the lifeguard? 'Cause we're about to drown in some tequila. Oh, boy, we're doing this? Really? - Yeah. - Okay. All right. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm! Mm. Thank you for that. - Coming in hot! - Whoa, hey, no! (laughs) You can't do that with this thing. What are you doing? - (camera shutter clicking) - Keep doing that, but now you're a streetwalker from Budapest who volunteers at a soup kitchen. Just go with me on that one. This is great. (laughs) (camera beeping) (chuckles) You know, it's so weird. Like, you think, think, like, after all these years... this is where you and I end up. Yeah. (no audible dialogue) Chris: When was the last time you saw James? I don't know. Like a year ago. Wait, what? So you've been home this whole time? Yeah. But... why even come home if you didn't want to see anyone? Who knows, Chris? (music playing) Oh! (laughs) Oh! (laughs) Martin: I don't think you can find a better quarterback than Brady. You know. No. He was smart. He knew he didn't have the legs, but, uh... Hey, hey, Chrissy! Chrissy boy, come here! Chrissy boy! - Ah. - Come here. Mr. Baker, you're still going. - Oh, yeah. - You're like some kind of rock star. Hey, Christopher, Christopher, you got to meet this beaut'. This buddy of mine, Rex. - Hey, how's it going? Chris. - Hey, how's it going? Look at this guy! Look at that motherfucker, hey? (laughs) This boy goes to Michigan State. Starting quarterback? You know, back in the day, back in the day, back, uh... eh, back in the day, I used to work out so fucking much. I mean, look at this motherfucker. (grunts, laughs) You know, that's where you know what a man is made out of. It's right up here in the shoulder meat. Yeah. Back when I was your fucking age, I used to work out all the time, so fucking much. And I was really fucking spiritual. Boys, I could do whatever the fuck I wanted. Oh, shit. (chuckles) And my fucking dick, boys, any time, anywhere. I could fuck like a machine. I could fuck like a woman wanted to get fucked. (laughs) Rum and Coke. Make it a double, andcuatro, amigo? You know what? Why don't you just smash my head against the bar. Could you do that? Muchos gracias. I need to forget about that conversation I just had with your pops. Hey, Chris, how are you? Uh, this is Rex. - Hi. - How are you? The party's here. Is it? (foghorn blowing in distance) (laughing): What are you doing? (laughs) I don't know. (sighs) So where's Mr. "Life of the party," huh? Where's that guy? Um, he thinks burping is, like, the coolest thing ever. Well, don't knock it till you try it. Super cute. (inhales sharply) And how about you? Have you seen any cuties? What, here? - Yeah. - Here, me, cuties? Uh... no, not... not yet... anyway. (Martin talking indistinctly) How come I never see you date anybody? You're such a nice boy. Yeah, it's, uh... because, I get distracted easily. You know what, motherfucker? Anytime! (men arguing indistinctly) Man: You need to go to bed. Come on, be a man. All right, you're from somewhere, they're from somewhere. Everybody's from somewhere. Oh, come on! What the fuck is this? - I think you guys are... - Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here! Go fuck yourself, cocksucker! Chris: Everybody's here for a good time. One foot in front of the... - Martin: You know what? - No, no, no. (grunts) Okay, if you tell me this is about Deflategate, I'm gonna throw this in his face. Fair and square. The Pats won it fair and square! Brooklyn! I fucking warned him! Chris: Hey. Hey, Mr. Baker? It's all good. Now security did try to eject you from the resort. Okay? You understand that? But they didn't. So... have a sandwich! Christopher... never have a daughter. Sometimes it's... it's a blessing, right? And sometimes it's just a fucking sadness. Right, Brooklyn? (door shuts) You happy now? (music playing) (no audible dialogue) (slurring): I think I'm in trouble. Que? Oh, uh, just... my friend. Pretty messed up. (chuckles) Um... you a local? You a tourist? Well, I work in here, but I have an American passport and my mom grew up in Ensenada. Yeah, I don't think I understood any of that. (laughs) So... you are Canadian? Ah,oui,madame. - I'm Chris. - I'm Ava. I work here with a lot of models. And let me tell you that Montreal girls are just unbelievable. I want to marry, like, five of them. - Oh, yeah, of course. - Mm-hmm. Well, there's kind of a reason for how they look. Oh, there is? Yeah, um... Yeah, have you ever heard of the story of "The King's Daughters"? (laughs) Oh, my God. Yes, I have. - Really? - Yeah. We were just talking about that the other day and one of the girls told me that it's about a bunch of brides of King Louis, and that he sent them to Quebec, right? And it was, like, a hundred of years ago, right? - Yeah, yeah, oh, amazing, yeah, exactly, yeah. - (laughs) Yeah, he basically hand-picked like 800 of the best girls in Paris and just sailed them down the St. Lawrence River. And they stopped off at King City-- "King City"-- Quebec City, Trois-Rivères and, uh, Montreal. And that's why a lot of people attribute, you know, the fact that Quebec women are so stunning because they kind of are... "The King's Daughters." And all my people are known for is a crater that killed all the dinosaurs. Ah, well, God bless the Yucatán. (laughs) And what about your friend? She's another of "The King's Daughters"? Chris: Uh, half, yeah. She's kind of like a Daywalker. (laughs) It's just like me. I've been here for a year. And every night I sit down and I see how this city chew up people and spit them up. But you know what? I will never trade this for anything. I don't know. Missouri's pretty nice this time of year. (laughs) So that's where you're from? No, I just assume it's terrible. (laughing): Oh, God. And... tell me something, what's her story, though? Are you here with friends, on a group trip, or... what? Uh, it depends. On how many are in a group trip. Whoa, so... there are just... you two? (sighs) I think that she really needs your help. Y--Yeah, um... (loud club music playing) (no audible dialogue) Brooklyn: Open sesame! (with accent): Yeah, open says you. - (laughs) - Closed, says I. Okay, do you want this one or that one? - (laughing): That one. - Okay, all right. Stop laughing. Stop hitting my head on things. Did I? I'm sorry. (normal): It's good to use your head. My head's pretty hard. It's okay. Right. Are you gonna be okay? (sighs) Um... Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go do something. (sighs deeply) - You didn't close the door. - (door rattles) Yeah, I know. Hey, Brook. Just leave-- leave the bathroom door unlocked, okay? Door unlocked. I got it. I'm just gonna have a bath. - (door closes) - (chuckles) A bath? - That is weird. - (water running) Especially at this... Okay, it is way too early or late to have a bath. All right, you have the bath! I have this. (snoring softly) (snorts, sighs) (grunting softly) Hmm. (gasps) Oh, fuck. Brook? Brook? Br-- uh... hey. Were you crying? No, just... give me ten more minutes. I'm coming out. Well, I thought... You've been in there long enough. Brooklyn, you... - Brook? - (door locking) Are you locking the-- Brook? - Did you just lock the door? - (water running) Open the door. Brooklyn, you got to come out of there. (sighs) Brooklyn. Brook... open the door. - (knocks) - Brook, unlock the door. Fuck sakes. Okay. I'm coming in. Okay. All right, now it is time for bed. Okay. Here's what we're gonna do, I'm gonna do this, you get up. (children laughing and playing outside) (sighs) - Chris? - (breaths deeply) Why am I naked? Are you serious right now? Hey, - it's tequila o'clock! - (groans) (thunder rumbling) Hey, fucko. (grunts) You come near my daughter again and I'll stuff a pigskin up your fucking ass sideways, you cocksucker! Oh, and one other thing, go fuck yourself. (music playing) (groans) (scooter engines revving) Brooklyn: I can't believe I took two baths last night. - (laughs) - Why... didn't you stop me? Well, because you bolted yourself in. There's nothing I could've done. - (groans) - (giggles) Did you, um... did you see my bits? Uh, kind of, yeah. But, then... you passed a gasser, so... - What? - Yeah. Here's an instant replay, you just went... (imitates fart) And then you said, "It sounded like a dolphin." (imitates vomiting) And then you threw up in the trash can, so well done! It was really the stuff that dreams are made of. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, what the fuck is wrong with me? (laughs) I don't know. But, uh... luckily after that, it was pretty hard to stay mad at you, so... I mean, come on. I'm not made of stone, you know? But... I think it's time that I ask the question. I-I still have no idea why you came home... and... went all Howard Hughes. 'Cause last night was an utter annihilation. You never used to party like that, at least not when I knew you. I know they do stuff different in Europe, but... - It's not that. - Well, then what is it? I mean... is there something or is it just the fact that we're here in Cancun? There's something. (chuckles) What? (sighs) When James and I were travelling and flying all over the world, it... took a toll. I saw a lot of crazy shit and... eventually my mind just couldn't handle it. I became manic. And... when we were in Paris, I didn't sleep for a whole week and I was a 24-hour party person. And then I started having delusions. I would watch TV or read the newspaper and I would think that they were talking about me, like... they were out to get me. I was living in between a dream and reality and I just couldn't tell where the fuck I was. So... James hospitalized me because, fuck, what else do you do, right? I was in a French nut house for about a month, and then my mom flew in and took me home. And then I was in and out of their care and psychiatric hospitals for awhile after I got back. It's been a long, slow climb back to a normal life, but... I'm getting there. Fuck! I'm sorry. Coming here was a really bad idea. You should've told me this before we left. I need this to prove to myself and my parents that I can walk through the worst of it. Listen, I know last night seemed bad and... I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner, I just... I didn't want you to look at me with a... stigma. (chuckles softly) All right. I mean... everybody gets one, right? (music playing) (cheering) (no audible dialogue) Light it up Light it Light it up (no audible dialogue) (cars honking) (whistles blowing) (music playing) Oh, my God. Hey! Hey. The white guy with colored eyes. - Yeah, yeah, that's me! - (laughs) I saw you earlier at Mandala. Uh,sí. Why'd you leave? Mm, I was talking with a guy and he made me so uncomfortable, so I left. Was his name Arturo? Uh, yes. - Mm, yes, yes. - Yeah. My friend's got her tongue down his throat as we speak. So cheers to leaving. Wow, so... mm! Good news. You're out of being her bodyguard. Yes, and it was the best decision I ever made. Obviously. How come... how come whenever I see you, you're always alone? Because I'm not an alcoholic. Oh, really? 'Cause drinking alone is what alcoholics do best. (laughs) No. It's because I'm friends with every bouncer on the strip, so every time that I came here with a group of people, the lemon drops and the cranberry vodkas never stop coming. It's like a hip-hop video every night. (both chuckle) I'm here from 9:00 to 5:00, so I ain't got up on Tuesday. - Yeah! - No! I ain't got up on a Tuesday. - I ain'tgoing upon a Tuesday. - I'm going up... - Yeah. - Fuck. - All right. - Mm. Mm-hmm. (laughs) Funny, right? (music playing) (no audible dialogue) (music playing) So, um... you like what you do? Yes. It has its trials like anything else, but, yeah. I live in paradise. - It's true. - (chuckles) I like people. I like talking to them, and the people in here is just chill. Mm-hmm. I used to live in California. Oh. Awesome. Yeah, I never been there. Eh, it's overrated. (both chuckle) So... where have you been? (inhales sharply) Here. Here? That's it? My dad took me to Buffalo once. But that was just to get pants. And I was nine. Pretty much asleep in the backseat the whole way... - (laughs) - so it doesn't really count. - You missed out. - (laughs) Uh, but, yeah, no, this is my first time on a plane and first time in another country. That's adorable. You're adorable. Mm. And you're cheesy. (both laugh) And tell me, why do you like to take photos? Well... I don't know. Uh, all right, um, yeah. Um... a few years ago, my mom, she went in for a scan. And she kept waking up with these, like, pounding headaches and these dizzy spells and everything. So, um... yeah, the doctors, they found this, like, lump around the size of a quarter pretty much, like... right there. You know, they... tried to remove it and everything, but, um... So, yeah, after the funeral, um... I was trying to put all these photo albums together and I realized that, like, all the childhood photos of my sister and I were gone. They just were missing. (inhales sharply) And I think as the years go by, it's... gonna be even more difficult to remember what it was like back then, you know? So... yeah. I think what I'm doing with my photos is... trying to make up for those lost years. I'm so sorry... - Oh, no. - ...about your mom. (sighs) It must have been terrible. Yeah. Yeah, but... (inhales sharply) that was a long time ago. And, uh, now I'm here, with you, so... Yeah, and... you never told me. What? That I'm a robot from the future? I thought everybody knew that. Hey, shut up. (laughs) You never told me... what's the deal between you and the girl. Ah... come on, what are you doing? We were having such a nice time. Yeah, but you keep saying that you're just friends. And there's a story in there. What's going on? Yeah, sure, there's a history, obviously, you know. We dated in high school and everything, but that was, like, a really long time ago. And... she's doing her thing and I'm doing my thing, so it's fine. (laughs) I don't know why, but I think that it's a little bit more complicated than that. No, that's it, that's the story, I promise. Uh-uh. (chuckles) You Canadians are just like... - so nice... - Yeah. (chuckles) ...that you can never end the relationship in a bad way. Mm-hmm. You have to stay close forever. Oh, ho-ho. (sighs) Well... Wait. Are you leaving? What's going on? Yeah. I have to wake up early tomorrow because I have to work and we're doing our event, the... New Year's Eve eve at the Palazzo. Oh, yes, of course, I mean, you know, even... more important than Christmas Eve eve is, of course, the well-known New Year's... - Eve eve. - Eve eve. - Yeah. - (laughs) Um, okay, all right. Well... um... it's really... great hanging out with you. Mm... so... we... No, no, no, we are not gonna kiss. - No, of course. - No. Did I give you that vibe? Yes, I did. (laughs) No, I... I was just going... - I'm so sorry. - I was going for the hug! - No. - It was just a hug. I just get out of a very serious relationship. Ugh! Of course you did. - Don't put that on me. - (laughs) You have your own shit to deal with. Yeah, but I thought... - Uh-uh. - it was a thing happening... - And I'm... - here. I have to go. All right. So, um... we ever gonna... talk again or... we done here? (sighs) You know what, Chris? Let's take this moment for what it was. I help you out after you watch your ex making out with a random guy at the bar. And... my work is done. (music playing) (door closes) (music stops abruptly) -(music playing) - (waves crashing) I woke up this morning and... she wasn't in her bed. Jesus Christ. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold it. You left her alone in a club last night? Not-- not really. I mean, we there and we were there for like a couple hours, and then she met this local guy. And, I mean, she-- Look, I love hanging out with your daughter, she's great and we have a lot of fun, it's nice that we've reconnected, but at the same time, I mean... I don't want to be like a mother hen. No. No. It's not your responsibility to look after her like that, Chris. What were you gonna do? Drag her out kicking and screaming? She should've left when you wanted to leave. Yeah, well, I'm sorry, I should've, like, stayed longer - or tried harder to get her. - No. No. - I'm really sorry. - Don't beat yourself up. Hopefully she's okay. We'll figure this out. All right, I'll go around the beach a few times, uh... talk to the front desk and, uh... - Yeah. - Whoa. Yep, yep. Uh... hey. I can tell that... you were told on some level about... Brooklyn's little episode overseas. Yeah. It was not right of us not to tell you what you might be dealing with. What her father I have dealt with since she's been back. I apologize for putting you through that, Yeah, no, Ana, no, no, no. Don't be sorry. It's... it's fine. I mean, it's new, but... but it's fine. I... I can handle it. And, hey, like you said, we'll figure this out. - Yeah. Yeah, we will. - Yeah. It's gonna be okay. Fuck. Ana: So you haven't heard anything? Not a peep. No one's e-mailed, texted or called. It's 2:00 in the afternoon. The fuck happened to my daughter? I think it's time we talked to the front desk, figure out our next step. Chris: Yeah, yeah, and I'll go up to the room and get her phone in case anybody calls. (music playing) Why'd you leave? Ava: Mm, I was talking with a guy and he made me so uncomfortable so I left. (knocks on door) Yes, Ana? (music playing) (claps) Well, come on, tell me the story, and it better be fucking good 'cause we were scared shitless about you, Brooklyn. Okay. Um, so, after you left, Arturo and I hung out at the bar for a bit. And, um... eventually we left, too. Together? I'm just asking. So I was bragging to him about how cool our resort is, and he really wanted to come back and check out the bar. Okay, we just met. I was not gonna sleep with him, but thanks. Okay, continue. Anyways, when we got back, they wouldn't let him in. And I went to the front desk and I told them that, you know, he was a friend, he was guest, but they said, without a pass, that they couldn't let him in. So I thought that was pretty shitty. And, um... I kind of made this rash decision that getting loud and obnoxious would produce results. So... I don't really remember much, but, uh... all of a sudden, we were surrounded by security guards and there were Tasers... - Wait, what? - Yeah. You know, we were gonna leave, like, we were gonna leave, and then they zapped him. Him-- Arturo? Like he El fucking Chapo. Holy shit. So, me thinking I'm the hero that Cancun deserves, I jumped on the back of one of the security guards and started hitting him. (chuckles) And then, next thing I know, I'm in the back of afederalecar headed to, like, the scariest prison cell I have ever seen in my entire life. I felt like Clifton Collins Jr. in "Traffic." Jail? Y... you were in Mexican fucking jail? When did all this happen? I don't know, like 4:00 a.m.? Four... You've been M.I.A. for like 11 hours and no one on the resort knew where you were? Yeah, but it was fine, Arturo's friend came and bailed us out. Oh, that's fine, yeah, good, good. How long would you have been in jail if he hadn't? 36 hours. (sighs) Ay dios mio. Do you have any idea what you've caused your-- Your mom was gonna have an aortic valve burst in her goddamn chest and drop dead. They're both out there looking for you right now. You told them that I didn't come back last night? Of course! They're your parents. (sighs) They can't know what actually happened. (knocks on door) Uh, who is it? Ana: Ana. Uh, yeah, uh, hold on. Ana: Jesus H. Christ, Brooklyn. I know, I'm sorry. Christopher told me. Were you really out all night with a boy you just met? Yeah, it was nothing, we just snuggled in a hammock. - That's all. - (scoffs) Ana: Do you know how dangerous doing something like that is without telling anyone? Brooklyn: It's okay, I'm here, I'm fine, he's gone. Ana: What were you thinking? It was just fun, nothing happened. Ana: All right. Just... don't do it again. Brooklyn: I won't. And the Oscar goes to... Just an honor to be nominated, really. You really don't care about anything, do you? I mean, when is all of this gonna end? It's better she believes a lie, Christopher. I'm in a nightmare right now, okay? This is, like, crazy town. I got to go. I got to get away from you for awhile and just... - I'll see you later. - Chris... (scoffs) Oh, my God. (door shuts) Excuse me? Are you sharing a room with a guest named Brooklyn Baker? Yes. Hey. Brook. I got-- I got some bad news. You have to get up. Right now. And pack. What? They're kicking... You're getting kicked out of the resort. Are you fucking kidding me? Brook, you attacked a security guard. No. No, no, no, I have to go talk to them. There's nothing you can do. Their head of security just stopped me in the hallway. And, actually, it turns out that youwere the one who refused to give up your name. Which is why they couldn't contact anyone in the resort to bail you out until the security guard recognized you when you... came back just now. That's bullshit. Look, I gave them the wrong room number but, if they see you, you're gonna get escorted off the premises immediately. Then I'm just gonna have to throw some fucking elbows, aren't I? And end up back in Guantanamo Bay? Where you going? Brook! (music playing) Okay... I know I made some mistakes last night. We have to work something out. My dad, he's never been on a plane before and... my mom, she's a nurse and she deserves to be here. Me getting kicked out would just absolutely destroy her. I understand, but what happened last night was a serious offense. I'm truly sorry, there is nothing I can do. I know, but... you can do something, you can just let me stay. We have zero tolerance for violence. Okay. This is gonna sound confrontational, but your men, they attacked the person I was with last night. We were gonna leave, and then they just Tasered him out of nowhere. I have never had any issue with my staff being abusive. Oh, my God, none? Really? Listen. (sniffs) I swear I am telling you the truth and I am not lying, okay? You can see the bruises all over my body and I am not being paranoid. I'm sorry, but that is just not possible. I was in a jail cell last night, do you understand that? I was locked up fucking abroad. And your men should be fired. And you, you have the power to do that, but you just won't fucking do it. Okay, if you are going to use that words with me, I have nothing more to say to you. I'm just upset because I made one mistake. One mistake can be all it takes, if it is a big enough mistake. We have rules here. Well, you and your fucking rules suck, then! Okay, your friend has until 4:00 p.m. After that, she will be arrested and charged. Wonderful. (music playing) I was doing good. So fucking good. That's what can happen sometimes. The police? Took me months to finally realize that no one was out to get me and then, last night, my own fucking delusions come true. I snapped, Chris. Can't believe I'm getting kicked out. What are we supposed to tell my mom? - Hey! There you are. - Oh. Not again. You didn't show up at the restaurant. Uh, yeah, sorry, we were just figuring out what to do with our day. Well, if you're not too busy, Martin and I were gonna pay for you guys to go parasailing. (crying) I thought you liked parasailing. Jail? Oh, Jesus Christ, Brooklyn! Brooklyn (in Boston accent): Like father, like "d'awdda." You lied straight to your mother's face! Kind of like how you've been lying to us all these years about being sober. Hey, look at me now. Oh, yeah, two days. Where's your chip, Dad? Martin! Brooklyn! This isn't helping anything. We'll talk all about this when we get home. Brooklyn... there's no other hotels available. Nothing we can all afford at least. There's nothing? Christ. No. And, frankly, I'm a little tired of helping you out of these jams. Fine. Maybe it would do you some good to go back home and reevaluate some of your life decisions. (thunder rumbling) (music playing) (no audible dialogue) Chris: This is not the airpor-- um...aeropuerto? Chris, I'm not leaving. Not yet. - (angrily) What? - There's a room available here and I have an Amex my parents don't know about. Gracias. - Brook, Wait a second, what...? - Okay, this... is happening. No, it's not, okay? And not on your own. I know all you want to do is just meet a sexymamacita here in Quintana Roo. And I've done nothing but ruin this trip for you. I have fucked everything up. And that last place, that was for families. This... this can be just for us. No distractions. I want to finish this week, this year, on top. With you. And I have to prove my mom wrong. I am strong enough to do this. And I am way too close to just stop now. Brook... this entire week has been a roller coaster for me. I know. So let's fix that. (speaking Spanish) Uh, yeah, uh... yeah. Just, uh... meet me back here at 5:00 with your stuff and I'll cover you. (suitcase clattering) Brook... At 5:00. (kisses) (music playing) Ugh! (phone vibrates) Fuck... a dick. (over phone): What a story. Yeah. I don't know what to do. I mean, it seems pretty obvious. Leave the bitch. Going to jail, getting in fights? What the fuck, man? -That's nuts. - I know. What's going on with you, though? Like... So you don't go to this other hotel with her, then what? I don't know, I rat her out to her parents and then let the chips fall where they may. And then do what I can to get myself home and make back some money before I default on my dumb-ass student loans. (sighs) Okay. Listen, you know that, in the past, I've been with some serious daddy-issue-fuck-ups myself, so it's really hard for me to say, you know, what's right and what's wrong when you're out there in fucking Cancun with fucking crazy pants. But, I mean, look, I... I settled down, I got married to my wife who bored me to tears. (chuckles) Clearly. That's why we're not together. Uh, it's not her fault that she sucks. So it's hard for me to say, you know, "Go run off with that fucking Amy Winehouse, crazy bitch you got there in Cancun. So, ultimately, it's up to you, it is. But... (sighs) What do you... what do you actually want? What do you believe? I believe writing someone off just 'cause they're a little unhinged is... kind of a cop-out. I mean, I like to think I'm better than that. Michelle: Oh, okay, Gandhi. Well, riddle me this: have you actually made a move on Brooklyn, you fruit? Not really. Michelle:Listen, you're burying your feelings with this whole white knight, good guy, go with the flow horseshit. No one believes it. Guaranteed Brooklyn doesn't, no fucking way. Whatever she does, positive or negative, it drives you fucking wild. You want to put a baby in her belly. Just fucking admit it, man! Fuck, I want to. I know! I know, okay? Like... how do I still feel this way? I mean, I'm more messed up now then I was in high school. (chuckles) I am fucked. This is what she does. This... is what she does. Michelle: I told you, no one should agree to go on a vacation with their hot ex-girlfriend, okay? It was a bad idea to begin with. Look, the guys Brooklyn's hooking up with, they're not any better than you. They're just beating you to the punch. That's all it is. You have to be the hero in your story, okay? You have to be the one that changes things. You can't just sit around and watch it happen right in front of you, it's fucking-- it's a waste of your fucking time. Look it. Don't let anyone ever make you feel you don't deserve something in life. Whether it's at your hotel or hers... fuck, finally have some fucking fun out there for fuck's sakes! Beautiful speech. You get that off Instagram? I want to burn your face with hot oil. (music playing) (no audible dialogue) (bag unzips) Martin: If I could tell just one thing to you, Christopher, don't have a daughter. What I was telling you before, you know, a boy, you know what he is, there's no surprises. (sighs) When Ana here was pregnant with our own very little baby girl, I knew I was fucked. Fucking done. (sighs) Every time she walked home alone late at night, every time she talked to somebody who was suspicious, I was fucked. Fucked, you understand? Sometimes in this life, you know, parents, you do things... that aren't right, you make mistakes, you know? (sighs) But I honestly believe nothing could've prepared us for the last year. That's what I get for naming her "Brooklyn." (chuckles) Ana: Listen, coming here was a mistake, we know that now. I wanted to believe Brooklyn was okay, you know? Out of the woods. When I first flew her home, I had to deadbolt the house from the outside to keep her from running out into the street. She thought the neighbors were being kidnapped. Constantly. It's not your responsibility, Chris. And we're not asking you to go. But the reality is... if we go to that hotel and try to get her, she might run. She's done it before. Ava! Hey! What are you doing here? I just stopped at your hotel to drop off a few tickets for my New Year's Eve eve event. Right, of course. You and your friend should come. Oh, uh... yeah, that's probably... probably might not happen. Why? Um... Are you leaving? Not really, I mean... I thought that you have a few more days. I do. I have two more days. But I... I got to leave here. I... We're going to this other resort because... it's... I... stupid story. Do what you need to do. Thanks. Ava. Never mind. Brooklyn: I did not pack enough bikinis. Just so you know... I'm calling the shots now. Oh, yeah? Word! (chuckles) I'm responsible for you. Good or bad. And I'm not your bodyguard, I'm not your brother, I'm not your dad, I'm me. And I got you. So we'll do things my way. All right? So no more craziness, no more Arturo, nothing. Stick with me... and you're going places. N'est-ce pas? All right. It was a bad high five, but I'll take it. It was weak, that was weak. (music playing) (music blaring from outside) Uh... (clears throat) I, uh... just gonna go down and get some breakfast. Okay. Um... I'm probably just gonna stay in today. Yesterday was kind of intense. Do you want anything? Uh, yeah, just hold on. I, uh, got you something. Holy smokes. Yeah, I got it when I was waiting for you yesterday. So, hopefully, you're over that thallasa... (laughs) ...whatever the fuck it is. Yeah, yeah, me, too. Maybe you can be the next Jacques Cousteau. Yeah? Or at least... at least get some sexy upskirts on the dance floor. (chuckles) This is amazing. I know it doesn't really make up for all the craziness that has happened, but... hopefully it's a start. This is really great. So am I forgiven? - Bring it in! - (squeals) (laughs) Thanks a lot. (music playing) (music playing) (singing in Spanish) Brooklyn: So what's up? Chris: Listen, I... (door closes) ...I know that you're going through a lot right now. Um... so I'm just gonna... put this out there. It's just not the same without you! - Aw, Christopher! - (chuckles) Chris: So I'm implementing an executive order. The townspeople... they need their queen. Well, then... get me my fucking dragons. (music playing) (no audible dialogue) (as Bane): Oh, drink-o-cam. I was born in drink-o-cam. You merely acquired-- oh! Drink-o-cam. We have to get ready for New Year's. I call dibs on the shower and... no looking this time. I wasn't even looking the last time. (humming) Don't fucking look at me. Why are you looking at me? - What are you...? - Whyare you looking at me? Were you trying to look at me? - Why are you looking at me? - Do you want me to look at you? No! Stop looking at me! Where am I gonna look? Is that why you unlocked the door the other night? - Huh? Huh? - Hey, I didn't unlock the door. - Yes, you did. - I had to make sure you were okay. Were you trying to see something? - You know what? Just listen! - Let's fight! No, get off. - Stop it. - Get off of me... Okay, let's just calm down, calm down. - Just get off of me. - Calm down. - Just calm down. - Get off of me. Just... calm down. - (laughs) - No, stop. You have to stop hitting me, okay? Got it? Good. Okay. No, what? - (laughing) - Brooklyn, stop! What are you-- what are you doing? You were trying to look at me, weren't you? No, I'm not trying to... What...? What are you doing? Do you love me? No, Brook, you can't... do that. You can't ask me that question. - Yeah, I can. - No, you can't. - Yeah. - Stop-- Brooklyn, stop. We should go to Paris. We're already... somewhere. - Come on. What about Dubai? - No, I'm not going any... - No, I don't know what's happened. - Come on! - Brooklyn... - We should. I really like croissants. Yeah, they're... What are you doing? What... is going on in your mind right now? Just... You have to relax. Stop. Okay, I believe you. (taps Chris's stomach) (quietly) What? (sighs) Look at you. You look so cute in that outfit. Gracias. You're awesome. (chuckles) That's the booze talking. No, it's the Brooklyn talking. (chuckles) How much do you love me? How much what? When we're both 40, and if we're single, that's it, I am stealing you. We are getting hitched. (chuckles softly) Well, then on that note, here's to the greatest New Year's Eve - in the history of the world -Salud. (music playing) (cheering) (no audible dialogue) (cheering and applause) (music playing) (yelling, arguing indistinctly) (grunts) Hey! Wait a minute! Brook, wait up a second, okay? What the fuck was that all about? Arturo's part of some fucking cartel or something. I don't know, we got to move. Where do you fucking find these people? Me? Where the fuck did you go? You disappeared! What the hell are you talking about? I went to the bar for two seconds, turn around and poof! You're gone. You're like a fucking shitty magician. (angrily) Me? Me? The guy who's been looking for you for the last hour? Me? Yeah, you abandoned me! What are you talking about? Goddamn it, Brook. Ever since, ever since this trip has started, okay? I've had to deal with some 'roided up dickhead from the last resort, that asshole and then deal with you ending up in Mexican Alcatraz. What do you want from me? You have to stop because you are putting both our lives in danger and you are sucking the life out of me and everyone else around you! And you don't even see it. And by the way, who the fuck's name is tattooed on your back? You know what? You said it yourself, your day was shit without me. So you had to pull me back into this fucking nightmare. I was so okay in that hotel room, but, no, that wasn't good enough. That's how everybody treats me. If I'm not the life of the party, then what good am I? Yeah, so it's my fault now? Oh, my God. Stop treating me like I'm your little princess from high school. Get over it! - That was six years ago. - You still think that? - You still think that's what this is? - Yes. - Get over yourself. - I think you're getting a little cold in the friend zone, aren't you? I am so sick of you judging me and the decisions I have made. You have no idea what I have been through. What I've sacrificed, the life that I have given up. I have grown and gone out into this world. And, yes, I am going through some shit, but what the fuck have you done? (scoffs) Fucking out of here. (fireworks exploding) Brook... Brook! (scoffing) (chuckles) (music playing) I was my mother's only daughter I got my drinking from my father I've seen my share of stories From inside a bottle... (song continues quietly over stereo) Well, I burned all my bridges... Um... thanks for the ride. Thanks for coming, Chris. Really. Yeah, Christopher, it was great spending all this, you know, time with you and... I'll walk you to your door. And somewhere to hide (music playing) Listen, I just... want you to know that I regret what happened last night. Arturo wanted me to leave and go home with him. I refused, so he got mad. Yeah, well, I guess that kind of thing happens with guys you just meet. (sighs) Yeah. I'm sorry if I ruined Cancun for you. Yeah, me, too. You know, ruining Cancun for you. No matter what kind of stuff you're going through, obviously, I was the wrong guy to take on this vacation. I held you back. I've recovered, okay, Chris? And, yeah, it's still a part of me, but, what you saw, that was just me, not the problem. Mm-hmm. What do you think's happening? The Joshua Tree We're losing Chris. Chris: Yeah, listen, I don't know what happens from here on in, but... I'm really worried, Brooklyn. I'm really afraid that something bad is gonna happen to you if you keep living your life like this. Okay, take it easy. (music playing) (keys jingle) (engine starts) (camera beeping) Oh, man I got lost Oh, man, I got lost Oh, man, I got lost Oh, man, I got lost... (music playing) Excuse me, miss? I think you dropped this. Oh, my God. (chuckles) It's been awhile. Uh, yeah. Yeah, it has. (chuckles) Again. Yeah. Yeah. Uh... where are you going so late? I'm heading out east, actually. A little delayed, but I switched schools and I'm finally getting my degree on. Except don't think anybody else is on my flight. (soft chuckle) Yeah. This place is kind of a ghost town right now. Um... is that the only reason that you're going out east? I found out about Rue. Unfortunately, where we come from, word travels pretty fast. I'm really sorry I haven't reached out to you about all that yet. I just... (sniffs) It's, uh... There was... (sniffs) I was not expecting to talk about this today. - Jeez. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - I didn't... - No, no, no, it's... - I wasn't thinking. - (sniffs) It's okay. Um... The truth is, the last time I saw James, he was borderline homeless. And... the authorities didn't want Rue living in the same household as my recovery. Unfortunately, we did the right thing. But... my dad took it the hardest. (sighs) I didn't tell you because... I trust you, it's just, back then, I didn't trust anyone. I heard they finally gave you visitation, so... that's good. Yeah. Her parents are just so nice. And... she... she is hilarious. Yeah, I bet. (laughs) (sighs) It's crazy to think Mexico is already a lifetime ago, eh? Yeah. (chuckles) Moms really misses you. (music playing) Are you all right? Yeah. Listen... I'm gonna say this, but it's just to clear the air about everything. Brooklyn, I was in love with you. And I think you knew that. That entire trip in Cancun, and... (scoffs) probably a lot of years before that, too. And... blindly and stupidly as any person could've been in love with anyone else. And I tried to convince myself that I was over you. But, obviously, that was bullshit. So when we went on that trip, I tried to put everything aside. And just go with it. Let you do what you do, and I do what I do, and meet other people, and... whatever. That evening at the Oasis, and then that cartel guy, and... I just didn't know what to do anymore. So, I'm sorry, but I snapped. I thought I was strong enough to handle everything. But I wasn't. And that was really unfair to you. And I'm sorry. (inhales sharply) When my mom brought me back after... being abroad for all that time, I spent my days pregnant and crazy in her basement trying to get through recovery. (sniffs, sighs) And then they took my baby away. I needed those days in Mexico to just... feel alive again. Fight off the depression. I had my parents convinced that I was okay. And... I used you to keep me in check. (sniffs) I'm sorry, too. It wasn't worth it. Well, I mean... wasn't all bad. (both chuckle) (inhales) So, where are you off to? Oh, um, well, I kind of, sort of made a contact in South America. So I'm gonna meet up with them and do this photo session... - underwater, actually. - (both laugh) Wow. Paid? I damn well hope so. (laughs) I'm really glad I saw you. Yeah. Well... I'm gonna pull the chute. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah. I love you, Christopher. (music playing) (no audible dialogue) (people chatting, laughing outside) Brooklyn: I love you, Christopher. Have a good flight, "Domestic." Yeah. Adios, "International." Chris: She was... that girl. But... she wasn't the one. (music playing) (no audible dialogue) I was stuck in quicksand. And everything that I went through... was worth it. Because... it led me to you. My duchess... of Cancun. (music playing) Faced away towards the desert rain Lost sight of the goal Let me come astray Grab my bags And hop the train I love that slow rolling style Headed off To get rid of my past Wind is my shadow And I won't crawl back Gonna find myself A future to grasp Oh, a new life I'm gonna find But could you help me out? 'Cause I'm falling behind Seven days spent Trying to find what's mine I think I might be losing my mind...
