June 9th, 1966. Hi, it's me, Donna. I'm thankful for my family, singing, and my teacher at school. It's gonna be a great day. Bye, journal! Hey, what are you doing, man? Are you okay? Sorry. So sorry. - What are you doing? - So sorry. So sorry. You're the one who wanted to move closer to Coney Island. I don't know any husband who keeps the hours you keep. You still mad about the ink smudge on my shirt? I told you, that was just from the printing machine at work. I know the difference between lipstick and ink. I know all about the whore. She's not a whore, and I'm not seeing her! - I'm home! - Yes, she is, and yes, you are. I've sacrificed my whole life for this family. I met my guidance counselor today. Now I'm watching it crumble before my very eyes. Mm. This is good, Mom. Set the table, Donna, please. My counselor said that if I keep my grades... This family is crumbling. It's not just my fault, Winnie. It's not only me. Ma, Dad. I met with my guidance counselor today. She said that if I keep my grades up, when I go to high school, I should be able to get into a good college. College? Donna, we can barely afford to keep food on the table as it is. You're impossible, Winnie. You just need to find yourself a good husband. Someone who will take care of you and help you to start a family that he won't abandon. That's more important than going to college. Dad? This is delicious. I'm sure your secretary's cooking is just as delicious. Hey, Don. What's going on? Oh. Hey, Arleen. Hi, Ang. So... I convinced your ma to babysit tonight. That's nice, because whenever I ask, the answer's always no. Uh-huh. Yeah, well, hurry up and get ready. We're meeting Lori in 20. Ladies. - Hey. - You knockouts having the usual? Why don't you surprise us tonight? Just a soda for me, please. Aw, come on, Don. You can have one drink. - What? I'm serious. No booze for me. - All right. Plus, who's gonna drive us home? Special cocktail for you two. And a virgin rum Coke for you. Cheers. - I have to know your name. - Hello. I have seen a lot of beautiful women, sweetheart, but you are something special. I have to know your name. Thanks. It's Donna. Oh, well. Donna, do you wanna? Dance, Donna. You wanna dance with me? I don't dance much. Perfect. Neither do I. I have a feeling you won't take no for an answer. You're getting to know me real fast. And who are your friends? This is Lori and that's Arleen. Lori, Arleen, I'm Nick, this is my buddy Jimmy. Do you mind if I steal Donna away? Oh, be our guest. My God. Those eyes. So, tell me about yourself. Not much to tell. Yeah. Those eyes say different. Did you grow up here on the island? My family moved here just after I started high school. - From where? - Brooklyn. A city girl. Yeah. A big piece of my heart was left behind. I forgot I even had a heart until you walked through that door. You still miss the city life? I miss the life we had in the city. So much has happened since then. Like what? My parents got divorced. I'm sorry. And some other stuff I don't really wanna talk about on a dance floor with a guy I hardly know. I can understand that. You know, life's thrown me some curveballs. Like what? Like some stuff I don't really wanna talk about on a dance floor with a girl I hardly know. Like, I don't know. Maybe my parents would've been happier if they got divorced a long time ago. I'd love to see you again. Take you out to dinner. I like dinner. Okay. Oh, hey, Don. What's going on? You never lock the door. Shh. Come on, come on, come on. Yeah, well, this new landlord's a little too nosy for his own good. You sure it ain't this stuff messing with that brain? Ooh, girl. This stuff is the only thing that keeps the brain going. So? So? Oh. Oh, I know that look. Nick's planned a date. But he's only told me a time, because he wants it to be a surprise. Oh, my God! I hate surprises. How the hell am I supposed to pick out what you're gonna wear when I don't even know where the hell you're going? Hmm. Okay. Okay. Pull it together, Arleen. All right. Hmm. Let's see. Okay. Don, now you know I'd give you anything in this house, but this is my lucky blue, okay? But I think it's worth it. Try it on. I love it. Oh, yes. Ah. Yes. Yes, that's the one. Um... You like? Now try it with that. It'll match the buttons. You know I got you, girl. Every time. Oh, my Gosh. Yep. I am good. ♪ When we met My heart skipped a beat for you Darling Donna ♪ I knew that we had to be two ♪ 'Cause the feeling was true ♪ No more cloudy skies ♪ The sun rises in your eyes My darling Donna ♪ Darling Donna ♪ Darling Donna ♪ Darling Donna ♪ Darling Donna ♪ Darling Donna ♪ Darling Donna ♪ Darling Donna... Thanks for joining me tonight. Thank you for inviting me. I had a great time. I've been working, saving my hard earned pennies since day one, so I could splurge on a dinner with a knockout like you. And eventually open my own business. Tell me more about this business. I'm going to install a high-end flooring using exotic stones and woods imported from around the world. That what you do for your dad? No. He only installs carpeting. It's lucrative, but he's got it wrong. Won't he be mad if you leave? Maybe. I've been working for him since I was a kid. I have my own dream. I'm sure you'll make it happen. No doubt in my mind. I tend to get what I want. All right, smooth talker. What about you? What are your dreams? I always wanted to go to college and become a teacher. That's great. So, you're smart. Yeah, well... Yeah, well, what? I had to put that dream on hold. Donna. It's never too late to dream. I know, Nick. I know. - Easy. Watch your step. - All right. Gosh. I'm spinning. Are you spinning? Not like you. What time is it? I've to go home. Hey, hey, hey. You can't be taking the train at this hour. I can't be spending the night at your place. My mother is... Oh, I'm gonna be in so much trouble. Hey. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of you. No. Come on, Donna. Almost there. Almost there. All right? Let's go. Easy, Donna. Take a seat. Let me grab your bag. Let's get this jacket off of ya. You wanna lay back? Come on. Come here. Here you go. Oh, shit. "Donna. "Thank you for a beautiful evening. "Had to run out for work and didn't want to wake you. "There's coffee on the stove. "Help yourself to anything in the fridge. Can't wait to see you again. Nick." - You had us worried sick! - Us? I'm sorry. This is not the type of girl I raised you to be. It got late, I lost track of time, and he slept on the couch. Leave it alone, Win. Leave it alone? And just what kind of impression is she making, sleeping there at his place on the first date, couch or no couch? Do you really think he's gonna call you again? And furthermore, I had things I have to do today, Donna, things that now cannot get done, because you didn't get home in time to take care of your son. I wanna hear all about it. Good afternoon. You must be Miss Moretti. I'm Nick. I can see where Donna gets her good looks from. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. And, uh, who's this little guy? He's my son Angelo. Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you, Angelo. You get my daughter home tonight, Mr. Varga. Yes, ma'am. Bye, baby. Bye. I was gonna tell you. Hey, don't worry about it. Everybody's got a past. So... Is there a big Angelo? Last I heard, he moved to Florida. Just picked up and left. We don't talk. Too bad for him. You like kids? I like kids. Wow. Big house. Yeah. Yeah, it is. I wonder what this one's gonna be like. - You remember the last one? - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She looked like she was literally born in a dumpster. Oh, he has literally the worst taste. Oh! Look who's here. She looks... dressed up nice though. All right, all right. Put on all that makeup just for dinner? Girls, make sure everything looks good. - Everything's fine, Ma. - Looks great. You act like nobody's ever been here for dinner before. Come on. Hey. Who's this? Pops, this is Donna. Donna, this is my dad. Nice to meet you, Mr. Varga. Well, come in. Looks like you finally did something right. - Drink? - No, thank you. Oh. I miss you. Hi, Ma. I know, I miss you, too. So, who's the beauty queen, and is she staying for dinner? Ma, this is Donna. - Nice to meet you, Mrs. Varga. - Mrs. Varga? Call me Agnes. Let me take your coats. Introduce Donna to the girls. That should be interesting. Come with me. We'll see you later. Girls. This is Donna. - Hi, I'm Sybil. - Donna. - Paula. - Donna. - I like your top. - Thanks. Before you start, I just wanna say that I'm trying to make things right. I'm saving my own money to open up my own storefront. I found the perfect place. I'm just waiting for the business to go up for sale. What money? You quit any goddamn job I get you as soon as you find out hard work is involved. You should let me do your hair sometime. Hmm. You look great. - Where are you from? - Uh, the city. - Oh. That's nice. - Oh. Can we not talk about any of that tonight? Please? Fine. As long as you understand we're not gonna keep blowing money bailing you out of trouble. Now you want more money for some pipe dream business? Not happening. I swear, you could screw up a convent! Are you excited to meet the family? Oh, don't worry. They do that all the time. Oh, you know Hungarian boys with their hot tempers. Maury? Nick? Seriously? Girls, take a seat. Donna, you can sit right there. Oh, thank you, sweetheart. And what's this? Ma, you always told me that diamonds were the way to a girl's heart, and you are my girl. Oh, that they are, my sweet angel, that they are. Girls, look at how much your brother loves his mother. Look at this rock! What a disgusting scene this is. There's no way that he bought that. We're ready.

I was actually thinking maybe we could go out for breakfast. - Mm-hmm? - And lunch. Can you spend the day? I can't. have to take Angelo shopping for school supplies. Well, can't your mom take him? She has plans with Aunt Mary. And Angelo can't go with them? A three-year-old hanging out in casinos in Atlantic City? Well, what about your dad? Okay. How about this? How about I go shopping with you and Angelo, and then we go do something fun? Whatever you wanna do. You, shopping for nursery school supplies? Okay, whatever I wanna do? Whoo! Yeah, honey. Angelo, watch me. You gotta pump your legs like this. Whoa! - Yeah, that's high, isn't it? - Whoa! You know what else I used to do when I was a kid? Ready? - You like that, huh? - You wanna try it? I want to do that - Yeah, you do? - Okay! For some reason, it was a lot more exciting when I was a kid. Whee! One, two, three, go! Okay, here we go. Whee! Look at me! You don't do that. This is mine. You know how long this took me to do? - You don't do that, Angelo! - What's wrong with you? Me? Ask him. He's the one who drew all over my plans. You know how long that's gonna take me to fix? He didn't mean it, Nick. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - You tell him. You don't yell at him.

Well, you are supposed to iron the cuffs and the collar first. Morning, Ma. Well, who else calls me this early in the morning? Yep, everything's perfect. Couldn't be happier. Ma! Ma, I gotta go. What am I gonna do with you, kid? You just gotta make a mess every time, huh? Son of a bitch! Yeah, aren't you a happy camper? Jesus Christ. Hey! Where you going? I got meetings. I'll be back as soon as I can. Yeah, well, please don't let your meetings turn into another all-nighter with the boys. I won't. I promise. I'll meet you at the storage place. I still don't understand why we need to move in with your parents. Or why we need to move at all. You're always working. Where is that money? The money is going to getting the business off the ground. Please, Donna. I don't need you adding pressure to an already stressful situation. I'm stressed, too! In case you haven't noticed, our baby is due any day. And I'm doing all of this for us. The end justifies the means, Dons. You know what? No, Nick. What? Sometimes, you can be a really ungrateful bitch. Yep! Let go of me. I love you. I swear to God, I do. It'll all work out. You'll see. ♪ Bartender Pour me a drink ♪ Shots, please, actually. Let's get a round for the whole bar, if you don't mind. Oh, yeah! Enjoying yourself too, huh? You're still up? That's not good for the baby. Or you. You need your rest. I'm fine, Agnes. But, thank you. He'll settle down once the baby is here, Donna. This is like his last hurrah. He's a married man. He should be done with his hurrahs. Good night, Donna. - Hey baby, congratulations. - Oh, thank you, sweetheart. Do you have what I want? - You know I do. - Thank you, honey. You having another kid already? You just had one. Would you shut up with that shit? There you are, my sweetheart. - Ooh, careful. - Sometimes you talk too much, Jimmy. I'll take one of those. Congrats, man! Good to see you. What's up, man? I'm a father soon. I might as well drink up. Congrats, bro. Thank you. I'm a father, have a shot. Let's party. To my baby boy, huh? To Christian! And, and... One to me. - Thank you very much. - Congratulations. Congrats. Oh, my God! Oh, hello, little man. Hi. Okay, you've had him long enough. It's my turn. No, I haven't. I literally just got him. Like, I literally just got the baby. I should take him upstairs to feed him and put him to bed. Okay, and then we'll eat when you come back down. She needs her rest. Shouldn't we wait for his father? What? I'm just asking. Yeah, and who knows what time that will be. What's going on here? Oh, nothing, Nick. Just celebrating the birth of your son. Wow. Ten sheets to the wind. You must be such proud parents. Somebody pour me a fucking drink. Okay, well, goodbye everyone. We're gonna go. He really is beautiful, Donna. - Thank you Sybil. - Bye. Lori, would you mind taking Ang and the baby upstairs? I'll be up in a minute. Yeah. All right, come on. - Will one of you please deal with him? - Deal with me? Nobody needs to deal with me. I'll be just fine. Or at least I will be as soon as everybody gets the fuck out of my house. Do not ever talk to my family or friends like that! Or what, Don? You just stay the hell away from my daughter. Family and friends are the only reason why your wife and kids don't go without, Nick. Hookers and gambling cost a pretty penny, you know. Now wait just a minute. My son doesn't... I should have kicked your ass a long time ago. Oh, yeah? Well, you would have died trying, old man. - Get that fucking camera out of my face. - Everybody stop! Please! This is supposed to be a celebration. I'm doing everything I can for you and our kids, and saving for our house and starting my business all at the same time. And these people should be kissing my feet. And who knows what that business is, Nick? Huh? Who knows? We don't! All I see you doing is driving around fancy new cars - and staying out late every night drinking... - Arleen, stop! What are you still even doing here, Arleen? Get the fuck out of my house! - Your house? - Trash. - Piece of shit! - Piece of shit rat bastard! Get out! If you know what's good for you, you will get out. So, is it getting any better at the in-laws? Don't ask. Surprise, surprise. Speaking of surprises, you girls remember that one night? Oh, which night, Arleen? Spit it out already! Tommy and I are pregnant! - What? - No way! - Yes. - Congrats, Arleen! So I guess this means you're gonna be our designated driver Friday night? Uh, yeah, I guess so. Hey, maybe we can finally get Don to loosen up a little bit, huh? Well, I was gonna wait till after my doctor's appointment to tell you, but, uh... - Oh! - Oh, Don. Well, Pops? Huh? What do you think? What a mess! Maury, be quiet, he just moved in. Give him a break. It's wonderful, Nick. Just wonderful. We are very proud. Thank you, Ma. - I told you our son was destined for great... - Oh, my God. Oh, it's the baby! That's why I brought my Diaphragm out tonight. Here we are. We look awesome! - We're going out. - Make sure you're home on time. Mm-hmm. Probably not. Could someone please do something about that crying baby? Maury, be quiet! She's trying to put the baby down. Don't start with me, Agi! Don't make me come in there! Just keep drinking, Maury. That will make it all go away. Go ahead and kill yourself. That's what you're gonna do. You're gonna kill yourself. You are not the man that I fell in love with. I don't even know who you are anymore! Get out of my face! You hear me? - Well, pleasure doing business with you. - Yes, sir. That's for you. And, uh, when you get done with the business location, I will have you come and renovate the private home. - Sound good? - It sounds like a plan. - Shake on that. - All right, you got it. Come here. I want you to meet somebody. Donna, this is Mr. Emilio. This is my beautiful wife. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Emilio. - Nice to meet you, Donna. It's been great. I gotta run. - Bye. - Bye. - Have a wonderful day. - You, too. We did it, babe. What are you scared of? What, did you think I'm gonna come over and tackle you? I might. I'm so excited. Our first big commercial client. That's great, Nick. I'm really happy for you. For us, baby. For us. First thing, we're gonna get out of my parent's place. I'm worried about your mom. Can we not talk about any of that right now? Right now, I'm trying to tell you that I've found our dream home. What? I was just waiting for this deal to be finalized and surprise you. - Mm! - Yeah, there we go! Well, it's official. - I'm a cosmetologist, Don! - You passed! Yeah! And I already got a great job down at Big Eddie D's! - Eddie "the bigger the better" D! - Uh-huh. That's the one. He's letting me work at his apprentice shop. Ma and Aunt Mary love him. Oh, I'm sure they do. All right, now, let's get to work. I'm so happy for you, Arleen. You've been dreaming about this since you were a kid. Yeah, and look at you living every girl's fairy tale. It's not exactly what I had in mind. Yeah, I know, bookworm. You you wanted to be a teacher just like Mrs. Stevens in the second grade. Minus the whole nun part. Right. You wanna take a look? You like it? You have kids? God damn it. Nick! Nick! Stop! No! No! Don, what happened? Hey, is everything okay with your family? Yeah, they're okay. Was Nick out again all night? He promised you he was gonna stop with this bullshit. Arleen, you don't even know the half of it. What do you mean? I don't know what's happening. I never know what mood he's gonna be in. I feel like it's all my fault, because he always says he loves me. Is he hitting you, Donna? He just came home with another woman. Why have you stayed so long? I feel stuck. He told me he'd find me and kill me - if I ever leave him. - That motherfucker. When I yell back, that's when it gets worse. One time he ripped the phone out of the wall when I tried to call the cops. We've got to get you out of there, Don. Where am I supposed to go with three kids? I don't have a job, Arleen. We'll figure that out. You can't settle for that shit, okay? Hey, I'm here for you. It's not your fault. Listen, Donna. This is not your fault. We're gonna figure out a game plan, okay? Okay. He hadn't been home for a bunch of days again. So Mom had grandpa come over to change the locks. And Grandpa slept over. And then, what happened? And then my little sister was crying. And I didn't know whether to help her, or stay with my mom. And that's when my grandpa had the heart attack. How is he? He's okay. I haven't really talked to him since that day, though. I miss him. Mom does, too. And your stepfather? I don't know. He says he's sorry. How many more times does he get to say he's sorry? She keeps letting him come back. Let me see what you got. I gotta run out. Business. I'll be back fast, I promise. Hey, why don't you put the kids to bed early tonight and let's just the two of us have a nice, quiet, romantic dinner together? Nick. Love you. See you later. - So that's what I wanted to talk to you about. - Mm. I can't be dealing for you anymore. What? What do you mean? I just got a new delivery that needs to go out. Fast. Yeah, well, I got a business now and a family. I can't be fucking around anymore. Shit! I'm not good with people. You're the salesman. I supply, you sell. Can't you just help me out, this one last deal. All right, Jimbo. Just this one last time. Fuck yes. That's the Nick Varga I know. Your Honor, I simply ask that you set a reasonable bail for my client. Mr. Varga is a local business owner and a family man. He is also a member of the Kiwanis Club and sits on the Chamber of Commerce in Northport Village. Mr. Mencher, your client has numerous prior arrests, is charged with possession of a large amount of cocaine, and driving without a license while intoxicated. Bail is set at 150,000. But, your Honor, that's a lot... His next court appearance is set two weeks from today. We are prepared to post bail today, your Honor. Okay. I'm gonna make this right. You sound like a broken record. I really need you on my side right now, Don. If the business is gonna survive... Stop it, Nick. Enough with the damn business. What about us? I'm not your mother. What? What does she have to do with this? She's always bailing you out. She's always fixing things for you. Well, I'm not gonna do that. I already have three kids. I'm sorry. I... I fucked up. What are you running from, Nick? Me, Don. I'm running from me. I try so hard not to be like my dad that I do worse than he ever would. I love you. I just wanna give you everything. You never needed to buy my love. I don't wanna lose you. Can we please figure this mess out together? Please, Don. Please. What about good behavior? Don't you get a discount or something if you're good? My lawyer said 18 months is the shortest I can get. So, what're you gonna do about your business? I'm gonna run it from the inside. - From the inside? - That's right. I'm gonna tell them my business partner, whom I trust with my life, will handle business while I'm overseas handling our distribution for our overseas market. I can't... I can't... Grab your fucking balls, Jimmy. You owe me big time. Let's not forget whose drugs those were. Okay, okay. I'll do my best. Your best? This isn't up for negotiation, you stupid fuck. Make it happen. I'm gonna be the one doin' all the work. Copies will be mailed to you in a few weeks. It takes a little bit of time with processing and whatnot. I strongly suggest you be out of the house before his release date. Can you stay with any family or friends? Yeah. Sure. Okay. If he finds you, if you sense any danger at all, call the cops immediately. How is it I feel bad ripping my kids away from their father? You're a good person and a good mother, Donna. The man you've described can't be your concern anymore. You're making the best choice for yourself and your kids. So, did Brianne get into that class? Yep. We went shopping for a tutu last week. That's great. What about Christian? He's really excited about baseball. I need to see my kids, Donna. This isn't exactly a family friendly place, Nick. I know. Please, Don, before I go crazy in here. I mean, my own parents haven't even come to see me. Can you blame them? So, how are you? I'm tired, Nick. What happened to our fresh start? Oh, you messed that up. Donna... we agreed to get through this together. I mean, you got it made right now. I set that up for you. You would think that. And how long do you think you can run your business from this place, Nick? I've got it all figured out. Trust me. I need to start trusting myself. Hey, Don. What's goin' on? Hey. Isn't this a surprise. Well, I brought Francesco's. - Whoa. Fancy. - Mm. Cannoli? You always know just how to brighten up a dull day. Hey, well we're celebrating. You're a free woman now, Don. - Jimmy's in the back. - Ugh. Now I just have to find a job and a place for us to live. Well, what about your old job? Anything that lets me be done with this bullshit. I just wanna be happy, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make that happen. Mm. Okay, give me some of that. Mm, that is good. Varga! Varga! Fuck off. What is it? Lights out, man. Put that shit away. Bro, this is important shit. I don't need you bothering me right now. I don't care what it is. I said put it away. Just give me a fucking minute. You don't got a minute. I said now. Dude. It's just a pencil. I don't care what it is. Put that away now! You got a problem, Varga? Jesus Christ! It's a fucking pencil! You got a problem with guard instructions? Yeah, yeah, I do, you fucking pig. You're my fucking problem. Oh, I'm your problem? Yeah, you're my fucking problem. Currently, in this moment, you are my fucking problem. You think it's funny, huh? Huh? You fucking... Don't spit at me again, you son of a bitch! Two more months. You were almost out, man. I don't know if I can keep the clients in the dark anymore. They're starting to get suspicious. Really suspicious. Then make them get un-suspicious, Jimmy. Let's not forget whose time I'm serving here. I don't have Emilio's final cash deposit. He wants to go over the plans. With you. Fine. I'll give him a call as soon as my phone privileges are restored. Okay. And the final set of plans? I need those. Hire a freelance draftsman. Make sure we don't go in the red. Anything that's left goes to Donna to cover her expenses. Nick, Donna signs the check. She'll see if the numbers don't add up. You're a smart guy, Jimmy. Figure it out. Good morning. May I help you? Yes, good morning. Is Joe here? How do you know Joe? I used to be his office manager when I worked here. Oh, right. That Joe. No, my husband and I bought the business from him. Oh, okay. Are you hiring? What's the hold up? Oh, hello. Hi. I was just looking for Joe, but... - Were you his patient? - No, she worked for him. I have a long day of job hunting ahead of me. Thanks for your time. - What kind of job did you do... - No, Joe, we're not hiring. Hey, Donna. Why did my mortgage payment get returned? - Returned? - Don't try to bullshit me. - I'm not. I... - Are you messing with the money? No. No, no, no. No. Um, no. Uh, things just got a little tied up is all. What's that mean? What things? Donna, look. Um, when we get the check from the last job we just did, everything will be fine, okay? Trust me. Right. And what're you gonna say next? - The end justifies the means? - What? Don! Donna! Ah, see, they're riding again. Look at that. Would you like to do that, guys? What do you think? You like horses? Yeah, you do. Huh? They're nice. They're nice, huh? Look at those horses, huh? Aren't they pretty? Be right back. You're filing for divorce? What am I supposed to do, Nick? What more do you expect of me? I will kill you before you ever leave me. And you will never take my kids away from me. Ever. Where are my kids? They're okay. They're all right. They're at your mother's, okay? Where's Ang and Christian and Brianne? - Arleen, where are my kids? - Hey, Don, Don. Where are my kids? - Where's Brianne? - Your kids are okay, all right? Lori picked them up, okay? She took them to your mom. Okay? It's okay. We're gonna take you to the hospital. We're gonna file a report this time, okay? - Okay. - Okay. It's all right. - Okay. Okay. - It's all right. You're all right. I'm right here, Donna. I'm right here, okay? Are you okay? Are the kids okay? Where are they? They're fine. How'd you find out I was here? I called around. Nick showed up at the house very upset. Oh, he's upset? Well, he's worried about the kids and you. You filed for divorce? Look at my face, Agnes. He overreacted. It's what Varga men do. They have hot tempers. Once, Maury overreacted so bad, my face was almost unrecognizable, but I knew he didn't mean it, and I forgave him. Do you even hear yourself? Look, Donna. Nick loves you and the kids. You know that. He's got a sad way of showing it. You can't take his kids away from him. He'll go crazy. He needs them and you! And they need both of you together. What they don't need is a father who does this to their mother. That's not fair. Nick has always tried to make sure that you and the kids never went without no matter what. Well, maybe there wouldn't be so many "no matter what's", if you and Maury didn't bail him out every time. Donna, please. He swears it's the last time. He swears. It is the last time, Agnes. Well, how you gonna raise three kids with no job, no money and no husband? Yeesh, we give better service at Big Eddie D's and... Watch me. Oh, my God, we just saw. - Aww. The nose! Watch the nose! - Oh! - You're gonna rebreak it. - I'm so sorry. Hi, Miss Brown. Thank you. What's the matter, sweetie? Some of her classmates were being mean to her. Read a book about families today, and some of the kids asked why Brianne was the only one whose father didn't show up for the father-daughter dance. Oh. Oh, sweetie. Don't worry about what those kids think. We looked cute in our matching dresses, like twins. I took the opportunity to try to explain how some families are different, but they're still families. Exactly, Miss Brown. Thank you. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Bye, Mrs. Varga. Sometimes life doesn't go how we planned. And sometimes parents are better off apart. Sometimes mommies have to be mommies and daddies. And daddies have to be mommies, too, sometimes. That's not what my friends said. It doesn't matter what they say. All that matters is what's in your heart. Yeah, like remember that time they were making fun of you 'cause you wanted to play soccer? And did you let that stop you from playing soccer? No. You wanna know why? Why, Mommy? Because we're Morettis. And Morettis don't let anyone stop us from doing what's in our hearts. Or tell us who we are, or how we can be. - Check out this muscle. - I wanna feel. You wanna know how Mommy got to be so strong? - How? - Through a lot of tears. Because it's okay to be sad. It's a secret weapon. Mommy, you're like a super hero. Hop on board. Let's go watch your brother play some baseball. Brianne, isn't Mommy like a super hero? Here we go. Let's go. Whee! What do you mean "broke"? That's what his attorney claims. Doesn't the court recognize the fact that he owns a business and just hired one of the top attorneys to keep him out of jail? He's claiming bankruptcy. You've got to be kidding me! Please, Ma! If I keep talking about it, I'm gonna be sick. I... I found someone for you to talk to. Someone who could maybe help. I have a lawyer. A therapist. - Ma. - Look, Donna, you've never been the same since your father and I broke up. It's like we broke you, too, and we're both sorry for that. And maybe... Maybe I steered you wrong along the way. But, Ma... No, let me finish. This has to be said. I feel like... I let you down. I just... I was so caught up in everything that was going on with your father, and I was so hurt by the divorce and all our... everything. I just didn't do my job as a mother. You did fine, Ma. You made sure I never went without. But I could've done better. I should've encouraged you to follow your own dreams for you, not my dreams for you. Just give the therapist a try. Things have been very difficult for you for a long, long time, and you need justice and to get your life back. There's no justice for me. I'm raising three kids on my own, making sure they don't go without. But the fact is you're doing it. It's hard, but you're doing it. Thanks, Ma. Call the therapist, Donna. Okay, I will. Good. All right, now let's get this over with. Mr. Varga is granted visitations every Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Child support will total $50 per month per child. Your Honor, Mrs. Varga has an order of protection against Mr. Varga in place for another six months. Fine. As soon as that's lifted, Mr. Varga's visitations will begin. This court is adjourned. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Donna. Nick's team really covered all the bases. That bastard could get away with murder, and that's what really scares me. What'd I miss, beautiful? Mr. Varga, it's a busy day with lots to review. Let me see that. Oh, my God. When are we having dinner together? Domino Construction called. They want to know if you've reviewed the proposal. That's really cute. I love how professional you are. I was thinking something a little bit different. Would you look at this? 24 karat gold, diamond face, lined with diamond baguettes. It's very nice. Gold is a great investment. It's timeless. Are you finished? Shoot, sweetheart. Do you have to smoke? I don't have to smoke if we have dinner together after work. I'm busy after work. You have the floor. Thank you. Bye, have a great day. Okay. Hold hands. We're gonna say what we're all grateful for. Christian, what are you grateful for? I'm thankful for this amazing family. Brianne? I'm thankful for this house. That's great. Ang? I'm thankful for this awesome dinner, Ma. And I'm thankful for you guys. I love you very much. - We love you, too. - Now, let's eat! - Hey, Ma. - Hey. Everything go okay? Yeah. Gonna take a shower. Thanks, Ang. I'll drop this off at the bank today. - Okay. - Love you. Love you too, Ma. Hi. Can I help you? I'm here about the job. Sorry, we already hired two secretaries. The ad said you were looking for a flagger. Listen, this is not a place for a woman. This is hard working place. - Man's work. - Really? Really. Plus, good Lord, that's all we need. A bunch of wives coming around and making sure. I wish had something more suitable for you. You are pretty. You get him. Yeah, you got him. What are you, a mole in the hole over here? There's my bundles of joy. Come over here and give your dad a hug. Where are you taking them? Figured we'd just go for a drive. See where the wind takes us. That's not a part of the agreement. I need to know where you'll be. Fine, Don. I figured we'd go to the park. There's a new toy museum. Have some dinner. It'd be a nice thing to do as a family. You and Angelo wanna come with? Have them back no later than 9:00 p.m. Court order. I heard the judge loud and clear. Come on, you two. We got a fun day ahead of us. Hey. You know, I will never not love you. What are you... What am I going to do with you, huh? Before we hit the road, you want a little music? - Yeah, sure. - Yes. Okay. This song is dedicated to your mother. ♪ Wild thing ♪ You make my heart sing All right, you two. We're here. Dad, it says you can't park here. What are you? The parking police? - Lighten up, kid. - Okay. Look at this stuff, guys. Some of this stuff is more than 100 years old. Like Grandma? She might be older. I'm gonna capture it. What're you two doing in there? Don't make me ask again. Let's go. Look at those trucks. You wanna sit down? Dad, I got you a poetry book. Oh, nice. Let me read... Let me read this book. Hello? Brianne? Are you there? Brianne? Are you there - Which one's your favorite? - The Range Finder. Why is that one your favorite? It just looks really cool. We still have the whole rest of the day. What do you guys wanna do? Take a nap. I'm tired. You can sleep when you're dead, kid. Daddy, you're crazy. Crazy? I'll show you crazy, huh? I'll show you crazy. And for the cuties? All right, you two. Tell her what you'd like. We have the best Shirley Temples on the Island. We'll take two of those. Also, bring the, uh, shrimp cocktail, the, uh, clam on the half shell, and your, uh, lobster special. The kids havin' anything? They can have some of that. Okay, but we have a kid's menu right there. It... Yeah, I just said they can have some of what I ordered. Yes, sir. So, are you two always this quiet? Christian said you were mean to Mommy. That was an accident, and it's all behind us now. We're starting over. Fresh start, okay? Sundays are our days. - Whatever you wanna do. Sky's the limit, all right? - All right. - Okay. - What do you guys like to do for fun? We go see shows and movies sometimes. - And we go to Adventureland. - Okay. Okay, we can do some of that, too. Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You wanna come give your dad a hug? Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Mm, delicious. You want some shrimp? Ew, gross. What? What, your mom doesn't feed you fish? Ew. No way. Barf in my mouth. All right, you two, easy. We're at a restaurant. People are eating. Figured that would happen. These are on the house. Thanks. I guess I'm a little out of practice. Aw, they'll get you up to speed real quick. We have to go. Yeah, yeah. Okay. It's getting late. Mom said... Don't worry about your mother. You'll be fine. - But she... - All right, all right. I'm bored. I'm bored. Where's Dad? Mommy! - Baby! Oh, okay. Are you all right? - Mm-hmm. - Mommy! - Come here, honey! Is there a problem? The agreement was that the children would be home by 9:00 p.m. Yeah. Yeah, so what happened? Traffic. We hit a lot of traffic. Where were you coming from? What difference does it make? I just drove all over creation to have a nice day with my kids. Is that a crime? - Ang, get them ready for bed. I'll be in in a minute. - Okay. Mom, what does V-O-D-K-A spell? Why, honey? Where'd you see that? Daddy was drinking it. It was on a blue label with letters. - Okay. - What do you want? - To the moon and back. - To the moon and back. - Too many times. - You bastard! Take it easy. You're lucky I called the cops. This son of a bitch was out drinking with my children all day. I'm not gonna sit here and be falsely accused, Officer. I told you what happened. Why would my seven-year-old son wanna know what vodka was? Why, Nick? I don't know, Don. Maybe because we sat at a table near the bar. - Huh, you... - I'm out of here. I don't need to listen to this shit. You con artist fuck should be arrested. Add another DUI to the list. What? Wait a minute. You put that in my report. I refuse to let this piece of shit see my children again. Why don't you hire your legal aid attorney to come fight me? I don't care what you do. You will never be alone with my children again. Get off this property, you good for nothing. Fine with me. I can't get away from you quick enough. Mr. Varga. I strongly suggest you either walk, or call a taxi. Wish I didn't have to know his piece of crap car was parked out here all night. Yeah. It's one phone call away. Next. These damn people are slower than molasses going up a hill. This is my third trip here trying to sort this mess out. Like we don't have jobs. - Third? - Third. Oh, I hope I won't have to come back. I'm working three jobs right now. I'm just trying to get my son's last name changed. Three jobs? Damn, I only got two. Did their father pass and leave you penniless or something? Life would be a lot easier if that was the case. I heard that. - The night our daughter's born, he was nowhere to be found. - Hmm. I was so mad that I checked into the hospital with my maiden name. - Aw! - Okay, girl, now that's how you do it! Mm-hm Later on, he thought he was signing to change her name legally back to his, but he was really signing to change our son's back to my name. Aw! Good for you! Good for you! Next. Yes, how may I help you? I need to complete a name change request. Picture ID, please. You should receive your paperwork in four to six weeks in the mail. - Thank you. - Next. - Have a good day. - You, too. And don't stop fighting for your kids, okay? Or for yourself. Women gotta be stronger than pretty. We gotta exchange those glass slip... Next! We gotta exchange those glass slippers for some warrior boots. That's right. None of that Cinderella waiting around for her Prince Charming bullshit. I know exactly what you mean. I bet you do. You look like a warrior to me. Next! Oh, now you all of sudden in a hurry. All right. - Photo ID, please. - It's all in there. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. There's a lot of it. Take care of business. Okay, are there any easy notes you can do first? Yes. That one right there. All right, let me check 'em. ♪ I wanna hold you Oh, I know that it's true ♪ Oh, that I fell For you forever And every night ♪ I wanna hold you Oh, I know that it's true ♪ Oh, that I fell For you forever And every night ♪ - Hi, Gino! Sorry I'm late. - Hey, Donna. I got mixed up on our schedule today. Angelo usually watches Christian, but he has a football game and... Take it easy, Donna. All right. I got to bring him into work just this one time. No worries. Perfectly fine. You hungry? Good, go take a booth there while I talk to your mom. - Thanks, Gino. - No problem. No problem. You know what? How about I take your shift today? - What? - It's lunchtime, it's slow, it's quiet. I can use the exercise. That's the sweetest thing anyone's offered us in a long time. No worries. But I have to work my shift. Rent's due, and... Donna, listen. - Oh, I couldn't. - Take this. - I couldn't. - I insist. I insist. Consider it vacation pay. Really. You've been working long, hard hours, long days. Enjoy yourself with your family, with your boy. Take the day off and enjoy. I wanna help you out as much as I can. Just until you get on your feet. Okay? Go ahead and grab some sodas for you and the guy. I'm gonna get a pizza going, buddy. All right? All right, buddy. Can you stop with the doom and gloom, Christian? You don't have to go. I'm going for you. Okay, and the money that's still sitting in that business. I still don't understand why you agreed to do this. I feel bad for him. He sounded really sad. Yeah? He must have a new girlfriend named karma. Heard she's a real bitch. Hello, my beautiful baby girl. Hi, Dad. I'm not a baby anymore. Hello, Christian. Hi. - See you later, Mom. - See you later. - Love you. - Love you, too. Make sure they get home safe. Don't worry, Don. I'm just taking them to a nice dinner. Listen, Don, I was wondering. Can the kids come down to a special event I'm having in the showroom next week? I'm expanding to the building next door, and I'd love to have them both there. Next Sunday is graduation day. They're busy. Oh. Who's graduating? I am. Goodbye, Nick. Hey, Nick. Hey, Veronica. Remember my kids? Of course. Who could forget these faces? You havin' the usual? Vodka neat? That sounds good. We'll have water. You should probably be drinking water, too. They adopted? Thank you, Veronica. Okay, then. You know, you are starting to look just like your mother. Isn't she beautiful, Christian? She is. She is a Moretti. You, on the other hand, are starting to sound like your mother. Could be. She did raise me all by herself. - Christian. - I don't need to hear your remarks, Mr. Wise Ass. Maybe we are adopted. You know, that would explain a lot. You know what? I put my money into building this business for the both of you. Is that the truth you try to tell yourself? A lot of sacrifice and time went into keeping that business going. Maybe we should move on from this topic because we have way different definitions of what sacrifice means. Okay, stop it. Both of you. Let's just eat. How about that, Mom? You graduating from college the same year I graduate from high school. Right? Congratulations, Donna, you are officially the strongest woman that I know. You make us all so proud. - Thanks, Ma. - You did it, Don. You made your dreams come true. Love you, Ma. Me too, Ma. Just don't think about teaching at my school, all right? Don't worry, I won't embarrass you, diva. - Time to celebrate! - Yes! It's my recipe, Mary. It's Ma's recipe. She taught it to both of us. Hey. - Set these. - Let me get the forks. Yes. And let's get this party started, shall we? ♪ Let's fight the feeling now ♪ The world is turning Upside down ♪ Let's turn this train around Oh, okay. ♪ Until we hear the sweet Sweet sounds ♪ I'm all over it now ♪ Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh ♪ And there's not a thing I miss ♪ Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh... ♪ I'd like to make a quick toast. To Donna. First of all, I love this house. And even more, I love you and everyone and everything in it. So, cheers to you, Don. Determination looks real good on you, girl. Oh, my goodness, and Angie, my little handsome honey, you are the definition of what a real man is. So, cheers to you, too, baby. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers to my baby girl. Mm, that's good. Thank you, Arleen. Thank you, all of you. This is the best I've felt in a long time. It only looks up from here Yeah, up at 5:30 in the morning to be in my own classroom. - All right, let's eat! - Yes! Would you go get some pasta for the kids? Do you want a meatball? Okay, boys and girls. As you know, Mrs. Jones is taking some time off to have a baby. This is your new teacher, Ms. Moretti. What do we say? Good morning, Ms. Moretti. Thank you. Good morning, boys and girls. Who knows what day of the week it is? Monday. Good. Who's gonna be the first to tell me their name? Don't forget the... Donna! Donna. That's my name. It's a good, strong name. All right, then. Shall we get started? Hi, my name is Donna. The film that you just watched was based on true events that occurred in my life. I hope you walk away feeling empowered. Thank you so much. Home should mean that it's a safe haven for yourself and your children. Ours was a broken home. Whether or not I could survive that day, and was he going to be out for three days? Was he going to come home drunk? Was he going to hit me? Was he going to be yelling, screaming? Being in that situation when the kids were young, uh, I knew that that wasn't supposed to be the way you felt being at home, but that's the way it was. As hollow as the house was, it was as hollow as my body felt I didn't feel any life in my body. What's happening to you? Who are you? Where are you? What, what is happening to you? Don't you... If you're not going to get strong for you, why, why not do it for the kids? What are you doing? Do I want to put them in that situation? Did I want to put my kids in a shelter? I realized that I was causing a lot of pain to everyone around me. Seeing this and feeling this and hearing all of this just made me start to realize I need to do something, and I need to do it fast. Go to school at night and have, you know, uh, prepare meals during the day. I waitressed, I cleaned houses. A lot of physical, physical labor. Their father wasn't physically in the house. We were moving forward and everything was getting better with every, you know, day that passed by. Be better and achieve and become a strong woman. It was always inside of me. I feel better about myself as a person, as a woman, as a mother. And, uh, I just wanna be, you know, the best mother and grandmother and... that I could possibly be. - Good to see you! - You, too. - How you doin'? - Ah, well, I was doing okay earlier. Oh, yeah? Ah, I look like you. Oh, my God. What would you say to your daughter about what you went through and advice that you would have for her? My advice would be that, uh, of course that she needs to hold herself as being number one and... not letting anyone or anything get in her way. Uh, and to believe in herself. It took a lifetime of struggle and, um, and pain. Although, I always had the desire and the drive, I just let it die. And not to let anyone ever have your dreams die.
