For me, it's not workable even lying flat The tea is a bit strong today, isn't it? - I prefer strong tea... Everybody in our house prefers strong tea. Let me arrange this... Yeah. Biman will come tomorrow very early in the morning and will take you somewhere else... Well, don't you feel bad... Today here... tomorrow there... Nothing fixed... your mother doesn't like it at all I know, surely she asks you to come home Isn't it? Have you a sister, or brother? You know, something terrible has happened in my school. Oh I've forgotten to wash your shirt... let me wash it now, it'll be dry by night. Ready? I'm waiting for you... You're going with this shirt on? What's wrong? - Are you ready for action? What do you mean by action? - That's why I made arrangements. What arrangements? - Just see. Look. - What's this? A shirt. - What for? Wear it. - Why should I wear it? Do you know where we're going? Where? Go where? You'll have to wear this where you are going. These are bell bottoms. - Biman, I've never worn these. You've never been to this place either. You'll make me a Park streeter... What, you haven't shaved? Shave. Whose flat? - A lady's. Rich? - No. Don't you have any other questions? Young or old? Never seen her. She's Nikhil's contact. - Our person? Allows us to stay... Remember the name, Shila Mitra. You will see her after a couple of days. She is out now, in Delhi... She won't return, I'm told, for a couple of days... You've to stay alone for two days. Alone?... the lady stays alone? This is the key to paradise... Come. Wow! Fantastic... 8th floor means you're 9 storeyed. Decorated hell... What do you say? - Hell. Any difference between jail and this place? Oh! Money plant... Money by shaking... good luck Me, you, our landlady... what do you say? Didn't you include our group? Party... let me keep it inside... Biman... have you been here before... Are you mad or what? Goddamn what a place... Superb. You said that there's no telephone... Hey... don't pick it up... Let it ring, what's that to you and me? Can't say, may be even C. I. A... Stop it. Give me a cigarette. Mine are almost gone. Could you get me few packs of Charminar? That's a relief. The lady gets up very early? - How can you tell? Or else who could have called so early? Good... good for health Time... spending time is very difficult... I think I'll write an adventure story over these details... What... Biman... This is a girl's room... I mean a lady's First class, very safe, nobody will enter. It will be trespassing on entering. We'll file a case. But these materials are Mrs Mitra's. See what have you done? You please stop. You stay here... this is much safer. Okay. But the matter is... Listen you be careful, until she comes back... So I don't have to be careful after she comes...? Stay as safe as you can. - I understand. Now I'm going. I've arranged everything properly. There's the toilet... here's the key - Key? Key... for the flat? - Yes What do I do with the key of the flat? I'm not going out for a stroll. Keep it with you... You'll be coming? - Yeah... I'll be coming... okay Biman, listen. Biman.

Madam has asked me to take care of you. I'll be downstairs always... if you need me just call. Okay... Salute sir. Who? - The sweeper. He's come to take check in per madam's instruction... You are madam's cousin... You're from Delhi. You've come here to roam and sight see. Roam and sight see. And Mr. Mitra? Let him go to hell. Yesterday in Dum Dum area north Calcutta 3 terrorists fled away from a police van Immediately after this an intensive search was started. It is reported that though 2 out of 3 escaped... They captured the other one... Would you get me some tea... strong. Does Nikhil know? Must by now. That action wasn't right. I took great risk. It's only luck that I wasn't caught. Mass copying has begun at various colleges in Calcutta... for which the V. C of Calcutta University Satyendranath Sen has met in Darbhanga hall with principals of all colleges... Apart from other things the disease of bad habits that... Escaped, got caught, again escaped... Then what now? What? We'll remain hidden. We've escaped. Only escaped, nothing else... ...'sports news' That day I met your father on the streets. I was returning home from the office after marketing... He talked about this and that, about many things, but never once asked about you. Not even once. I think he is very angry with you. Very much. Since you're a revolutionary. But you said once your father was in a terrorist party... was in prison during British Rule. Then he was much involved in the movement of '42... I don't know how people changed so much. He would probably say the nation has become independent and there are lots of changes. But what has happened? Inclub zindabad! (Long live the revolution!) Bobby Bobby... You know, there's always fear. Yes, fear. Even in a lift. How? Believe me, as many people are in the house the number of dogs is not less Chased... You think he smelled revolution? Not at all, comrade of bread and curry. Allow me. Hey Biman, this is too much... there's no need for this. So, you wouldn't have eaten anything. Fasting? Take a look. Wow! Oh! With the food here, I can feed you for 2 days... and here there's the gas, stove etc. You want to eat? At present you eat this. I'm going What's the hurry with you? Oh! I've brought cigarettes for you 4 packs of Charminar... What a relief. Here's a match box. Okay, I'm going Hey Biman... you are moving so frequently, move carefully. Karim Karim Bishey... I've been sleeping. Do you know how late it is? Prepare tea, get up... How many spoonfuls? Eh... One & a half Father you leave. I'll be here. What you'll do by being here? You'll be late for the office. Go take a bath, I'll be here. You haven't forgotten that I must go to the office and arrange for your food. You still remember it... You go. There's nothing to be done here except taking the pulse from the oven. How are you, mother? Well. Who went to bring the ration today? Who else excepting him... why? I found father's mood is a bit off... that's why. Look. The milk is here. It's hot, drink when it cools. Where is Biru? Not in the house. No. He went out right in the morning. Oh... he is having his class exams. We also worked for the country, have gone to prison... our concern for the betterment of the country is no less than anyone else's... I find the young boys have become so irresponsible nowadays. Listen, father... I know... I know... I won't be able to win a verbal battle with you. You've become learned. Reading a few books from the Party makes you think you're very wise You just make a shower of words. We also knew about revolutionaries, talked about revolution... We too read the works of Lenin. Where were you then... your leaders were drowsing in the dark, taking opium, understand Opium... Listen father... you don't know or don't understand those things... like a fool. So... why did you stop? Say it. Come eat, you are going to be late for the office Stop. No one will have to do anything for me. Boys nowadays... they say things that they are not supposed to will say whatever they like. Wonderful. I'll be late for the office. Nobody has to remind me about my responsibility. He's asking you to go... go eat... What's that to me... I am a man. I am strong. I can do everything. I was in politics once. but you suffer, only you. The condition of our country as it is turning day by day... That's... mine Hello! My name is Shila... Oh! Yes hello!... Er... give those to me... That's alright. Biman asked me to stay in this room... - Who? Biman who brought me here... Oh. This paper is yours? Yes... I can stay in the living room... no trouble. Why are you standing? Please sit down. I feel I'm the guest of the house Yes, I've forcefully occupied the place. Forcefully occupied? What else? Almost like capturing Windsor palace. Without any bloodshed. Who is our enemy and who is our friend... this is the most important question in the case of revolution. We've seen repeatedly that to fight the enemy we've not been able to join hands with friends so in the past many of our wars have failed. The primary responsibility of a fighting organization is to inspire the people... to show the way... no revolution can be successful if the fighting organization misleads the people. If you can develop friendship with true friends... only then will the war be successful. My office? 9:30. You don't like coffee very much? Why do you say? Isn't it? Rightly guessed. That's what I thought. How do you know? I saw a lot of tea leaves beside the basin... a lot I'm very sorry... I didn't know where to dispose of that many tea leaves... Where would you dispose of them? Sugar? One and half... What happened? When you're not here then I had to make tea... and so many tea leaves. Hello... I am Biman... Hello Hello Come please Come... come Biman... sit I will have tea. I was really afraid. Now you've come, please keep the key. The key was kept with him. Since it's not very safe for me to go out, so he kept it. No, you keep the key. I've got another one. How much? - Oh allow me. Eat! Oh lovely It's hot No really not Take it What happened? Nikhil... I can't understand this. Which part? Here... where there is much rewriting. Oh that part: our educational system. No... no... that's alright Then Here In our country... Against our bourgeois education. I'm putting the word bourgeois down. Listen. Do it quickly. I'll write another 2 pages. You finish all the work, then after printing this you will be relieved... understand? And tomorrow remove this early in the morning before work starts. if you can do it this tonight, okay. And look... Biman Come What's up so late? There's total jam in North Calcutta, trams and buses not moving. I had to walk. Have puffed rice... Take this and read. It will be a very late night, you know. Have you finished? Wait, it's not a machine like yours. I'll finish, only then can I go home. And will I get any time off tomorrow? Those are ready? - Yes. Superbly narrated here! Where? It's about their meeting in Maidan... Is it all right or do you think I've been excessive? But I was in that meeting... You? What? I was in that area on some work. Had some time on hand, saw a packed crowd... so listened for a bit. It was not proper for you to go there. The boys of their party could have identified you. You might be in trouble. No, I didn't enter the crowd. And I couldn't see. What's the use? It's unnecessary... Nikhil, what is done with this one? Which one? - This one here Oh something... That day at the meeting, there was a big crowd, a great public gathering. Must have been over a hundred thousand Seems you're quite impressed. You know Biman, they will go on doing this forever. They will arrange and gather people by train, by hiring buses, by walking, they will bring people from various places... There'll be arrangements of food as there are always... People will come with their families to see Calcutta. This is last... do it carefully. There is some overwriting. And you know what happens after that? You saw it today: meetings, hot speeches, resolutions, songs and music, pandemonium... trams and buses are stopped... revolution... But they are saying we don't have public support. The public is not with us... whatever is coming scares us and our threats... we have not been able to make the common people aware. You are saying they don't believe? Adulation... Everywhere only adulation... the paradise of adulation... within this pure baby food Henco's Vita tone... Vita tone in the service of the country and everyone's children the baby food Henco's Vita tone... to bring a smile to a child's face and raise hopes in a mother's mind... One and only Henco's Vita tone. Wonderful, you have made your point very very well. Tell her... she has done the job... Shila has done everything... Not at all. I must congratulate you... Thank you Well may I see it once again? Certainly... When would you deliver it? It won't take much time. Still an approximate time. Well, within 6 months time... you know the electical conditions... It's being said conditions are improving... Ready Adulation everywhere... the paradise of adulation in this pure baby food Henco's Vita tone... in the service of the country and everyone's children... Henco's baby food Vita tone... Made with Vita tone and amino acid: Henco's baby food Vita tone. I can't understand... no I can't understand that so many people... so many fresh young boys dedicated... and prepared to do everything. But what they are doing... what they are made to do... what you are doing... what I'm doing... - You've carried forward the revolution. You've not surrendered? Oh no, I haven't surrendered. Eating and sleeping and in your language waiting for instructions. Don't you see we've no programme in front of us? Well, Biman, don't you see that... we are floating in air... darkness... blank... Sumit, now you're temporarily confined here, no way to go out, communications cut off. That's why you're frustrated No. You know only clich? words: frustration, cut off, defeatism... Any question previously I didn't ask, didn't know how to, now I'm asking! I've not said it like that... Yes you've said... cut off. Okay I'm cut off, but you're not cut off. You're moving around, working. With plenty of risk. You're coming to me as many times as necessary. Can you say, with your hand on your heart, that you Have you any aim, any organizational group from which you could get energy Strength... I am sorry, Biman... You are probably thinking that I'm injecting poison in your mind. You know really... You, me, nobody can go back... It's not possible to return. Sumit I... I'm going... Hey! Don't break your promise. Come sit... sit I will serve you tea with a ham sandwich. Why am I feeling like going to the toilet so often today? Because you're drinking cold water. Very good. Mihir, you see it's becoming too much... Shila, I know, we know that excesses are being done... There is a streak of genius in you. It's not fair... Sister you see... What sister will see... Spent her entire life in the kitchen and marketing... but it can't be said that she hasn't dabbed in art... You see... just draw a bit and how he is teasing... Listen... Shila listen... Today in the history of our office it's an event, a remarkable event... Why? An event because, yes, it's an event. A client like this in the baby food product line... where everybody of Ad World knows him to be a tough nut... you made him flat with the depiction of a story. I've done as per the brief given by the client They give a brief and then change it... Change it very often... So I'm saying we, who are admirers of the lady... Admirer! We, who are admirers, are requesting... requesting earnestly The request will come later. The food is getting cold. Come eat. What's the hurry? Shila, I am requesting today you have whisky to celebrate this occasion. No... no... no... not me. I suggest we all celebrate the beautiful day. Today a few important questions have come to my mind... that's why my letter... with whom and for whom is our war... with the public and for the public... for farmers, middle class and working class people... my question... have all of them come as they should have? Not in fear but at their own urging. Hello... You... ringing up once again... No, I won't listen to anything... I'm telling you I won't say... what's the matter with you... Haven't I told you? Look, look, why do you keep disturbing me like this? Why do you go on disturbing me again and again... When you know the relation has ended. Then allow me to live as per my liking... You be like yourself. Yeah right, I'm responsible. Your behaviour... you day after day... You listen to me, yeah... So what do you want me to do... what? Money... You want money... Again. Blackmail... Aren't you ashamed? No! No... you won't get even a paisa... Yeah... I am aware of prestige... I've been able to leave you as I'm aware of it... Why are you telling about this again... look, leave me alone... I'm tired... No more The son is mine. ...son is mine... No more! Well, in the drawing room... meaning in that room I saw a picture on the wall, a painting... whose? Oh! Yeah Whose picture is that? That is my son... Why? Oh! Just... An artist, one of our friends painted it... how is it? Good... what's the name? Whose? Of the artist? No your son's... Kunal Kunal? A very unusual name... how old is he? Now... 6 years. He still rides horses? I saw a wooden horse in that room No... no not horses... horses aren't in now... now it's cricket... Ready... Googly... Oh my! Slowly Out! Son says he is Gavaskar... And you? Bedi... Chandrashekhar? Once my son comes... I am not spared... Meaning when he comes to Calcutta... he reads in Darjeeling... on vacation... You'll excuse me... Last night when you were talking on the phone... I heard... You became very excited... you weren't talking normally... Talking loudly... and I was just in the next room All my friends... got quite messed up, you know... I tried very much... But we couldn't live together... He was creating a lot of trouble... He is still troubling. Tries... Oh! I'm getting late for the office... I'm leaving, okay? Won't you eat anything? I'll have to have my breakfast somewhere else... You finish all these. Okay. Last night you had no dinner... That's very bad... Hello my name is Shila Mitra. Me and a few of my office colleagues have come on a special mission. To make a survey. Which you can call... yeah, an attitude survey... We've a question for you... we've heard of many changes in our country... social, political and many others. Our question is, this change... could it be found in the relationship between female and male... or is what's going on the same as always? Listen... nowadays going out, working, earning... everything we are doing like men... but still what is meant by total freedom for women hasn't come as yet. Because even now whether we earn or go out to travel... whatever... depends on the consent of men... we do not do anything without their wishes. On paper female and male enjoy the same rights... that's what we've heard... we can only say more and more women are getting an education... and getting the scope of an education... they have gotten a certain amount of economic freedom. If you talk about the social structure of our country... then it has to be said that the conditions still prevailing in our country... as it has not changed totally... some changes have come but not total... for the partial changes that have occurred there certainly has been some respect. I can't say exactly if the respect has increased... what has increased is the awareness that... relations between male and female are under stress and strain. The more women enter the labour market and mercantile affairs as a commodity... their identities are getting changed... Nora's privileged position in The Doll's House... here I use the word privileged in quotes... they've definitely come out of there but haven't gotten the same recognition as men. A society stands on its wealth... this society... ...like other countries, ours too is a Democratic country... here, who's got the wealth also has the power... here, who aren't rich have also no pride I've seen from the experience of my political career... that in any movement a young widow comes with such determination in our work that those who live under the guardianship of husband or son... they can't... she has always awaited the agreement of husband or son. In any poor family where the husband is established... such families are a fine picture... but where the wife is more established than the husband... there arises some complex question... husbands can't accept it... quarrels start and the neat result does not bode well. You can see changes everywhere... about 20 years ago I saw a group of 15 or 16 women going to the Ganges to bathe taking at least a boy of 10 years old... now you do not find such things... but in my own family my mother-in-law has never gone out anywhere without a closed horse-driven cart... but after my marriage gradually I've seen her going to her daughter's place by bus, going to the hospital... in all places, in meetings and processions, on roads, buses and trams, in cinema halls and playgrounds, I'm seeing women in large numbers... but this cannot be a change... because the main thing is oppressive social conditions... Here if the social structure is not changed, the freedom of women is doubtful... The conditions are so intertwined that unless the social structure is changed there can't be any change in women's conditions. I'm saying again before ending my long letter ...India now requires revolution in all stages. Darkness, superstition, poverty and oppression... against all sorts of attacks... to create a new society and new people... but if we ever make any mistake in this extreme war... If we take wrong steps in blinding rage... if we get sucked into destruction and blundering mistakes then history will never forgive us. I salute the revolutionaries. Load sheddding in the city Hello what's up? You're early. What's the time? An executive director of our company died... stroke... ...the office is closed. Very good... so! Now you can have a good sleep I came to office that day even... there was a board meeting... Anyway... like to have tea? Hello... This is a wrong number. Tea or coffee? Tea I knew you would have tea... Why do you read so many books? Did you say something? No... I was saying hasn't Biman come today? No... he hasn't come the last 4 days What? He isn't in any trouble... is he? No... problem... don't think so... Nothing can be said. Don't you see in the papers how arrests are being made? Why are you laughing? There will be none to continue the heritage. Meaning how arrests are being made! Biman is a very cautious person... he won't be easily caught... Probably he is angry at me. Really? Yeah that day I had a big argument with him. What? You are like us... if you quarrel you don't see each other's face... there must be some cause. Yeah... that is there... I probably said a little too much that day... Maybe... he has reported against me... I am showing doubts... frustration, criticism, defeatism. Here... Take it... you haven't got one... How did you get it? Why? Haven't I got any intelligence? No... not that... A bearer of my office supplies these to me in time... from somewhere he has heard that my brother... you know I'm not Bengali... my native place is Punjab... But I have always been here, in Calcutta. My father had a business here. The house that you have seen, all the materials... Everything is my father's... my brother... younger brother... my only brother, very bright like you all... from childhood he was a bit typical... different from this house... self-willed, obstinate... carefree, independent, quarrelsome father didn't like his friends. He was very stubborn... It looked like they were enemies forever. Then one day 3 years ago, my brother left the house, forever... Punjab... Punjab was in a deep unrest then as was Calcutta. Have you heard the name of Ropar? Ropar... from there my brother wrote a letter to me... Don't think of me. I am not alone. With me there are hundreds of thousands of people... those who are dreaming to build a new society... fighting... the hungry people of our country are fighting. People who barely have one meal a day. Entire Asia is fighting, Latin America... I want to live among all the freedom loving people of the world. That is the last letter of my brother. Sumit With revolutionary salutation, Sumit. So nowadays Sumit... So Sumit nowadays is thinking like this. Sumit wants to meet you... Wants to talk with you face to face... and Nikhil whatever I said about Sumit and the lady... I've no concrete proof of that. You just said you've seen them. Yeah, just that... I saw just that... I thought at that time. Biman, now you may go. We will have to think about Sumit. Come after about 4 days... go. What do I say to Sumit? You'll not go there now. Okay. Listen... You are not eating properly. Your health is declining. Stay cautious. The situation in your area is not good. I know... Do you know Amal? Amal, who? - Of Belgharia Amal...? Is he arrested? We have doubts about him... we have concrete proof Nikhil, you are making a mistake. -Go! Long live... long live... Unity of labour... war, war... We want to live making war... Dearness allowances will have to be paid at the enhanced rate... Retrenchment will not be allowed. War, war we want to live making war... Long live... long live... Are you coming? Oh no... ok bye... bye bye. Bye bye thank you for coming Good night... see you. Hey, were you asleep? No. You had to remain confined for a long time. So... what can you do? You know, I really tried hard to stop them from coming today. Why? I don't like all this. I've not said anything to you that you've called them. I didn't call them. Your telephone... your telephone Hello... you... how are you? Will speak? Hold on... Telephone, listen to your telephone. For me? My telephone. Yeah... Nikhil... wants to talk with you... Hello... yeah, quite well... as far it can be in this condition... Nothing new... going on... yeah For a few days me too... yeah Yes I've talked with Biman. Yes, I've written those words in a letter. How strange... if I've some questions then... Hey... listen Nikhil, Nikhil... I am saying that I don't want to say these words through telephone or by letter... No listen... strange... you at least listen to my words ...yeah... I am saying... these are certain basic questions... which are to be discussed. Yeah... could be discussed face to face. Yeah... What Oh Well indeed. So you question my integrity... after such long time. You... no listen Nikhil... to discuss these words... our telephone if I could have faced you then... these words ...no... no Nikhil... the lady... ...what? Me? The lady... Who said this? Biman... Biman... has said? Biman has reported? Nikhil... that's my personal matter... yeah... I'm not bound to give an explanation for this. No... no! What did Nikhil say? Probably I can't stay in this house anymore. Why? - That only Nikhil knows... and Biman. Come. Sit. What's your news? It's so long. The key of your flat... I'll not be needing it anymore Would you have tea or coffee? I'm in a hurry. Wait for 5 minutes... I've finished my work... we will go together, yeah. No... today I'm in a hurry... okay? There's a saying in Bengali: a dilemma everywhere... my condition is more or less like that. I was saying... was saying Here I've no problem... you can stay here. No... I can't Why? You think everything is finished, now there's only comfort and rest. But I've not said this to you. You know... the time it takes to build a party it is same when leaving. But the party wants you... See... the party is nobody's personal property. You've got to fight inside and outside. You are alone. At present. Biman will not come to this house anymore. I know... ...once I too was like Biman... didn't know how to question... cannon fodder without question, without thought. Where is Sumit? I need Sumit very badly. the condition of Aunty is very bad. your mother and brother came to my house. They want to see you once. Do what you think best... I'm going. Biman! Now what will you do? What's the time? About 9 Oh! I can drop you there? Okay, stop here. I'll get out. it won't be prudent to go any further. You better go. Please ring me up and inform me how she is. - I'll try... Do you know my number? - Yes I will wait... You go away. It won't be safe for you to stay here alone. Who? Who? You? You should have been here earlier. since you've come at last... yeah, I wanted to see you. Go Go Biru Biru Biru If you'd come a bit earlier dear, you could have seen her alive. Biru, when did you inform Biman? You are informed... who gave it? Listen. Me? I have to talk with you. Come. Hello, how are you dear? Well Sit You please go away. I'll talk for some time. That you've come is very good... You are the elder son... you have responsibilities. They have come, all these people. they all are aware. So I was saying it won't be right for you to stay here... so I was saying don't worry for me. They are here. Somehow they'll manage the necessary work and the last rites that Biru will do. You better go before more people catch on. Father, please stay cautious. I'll be alright... and Biru's job... I believe he'll get it, but... I'm going. I'm going. Okay. Wait. Mother talked about me. Yeah. I haven't yet said one thing. I haven't told your mother. There would be no point. I won't be able to save her. Let the rest of her days be peaceful. 7 days ago... the manager of our office called me into his chamber. only me... called many others... and gave me a printed paper bond I won't be able to strike gold with. but I'm telling you... I haven't signed that bond. Go... to war. FOOT SOLDIER.
