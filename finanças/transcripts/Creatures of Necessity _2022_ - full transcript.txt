[creepy music plays] ♪ [Isabella] I bet you're wondering who I am, what I look like. Maybe someone you've seen in a magazine, CNN, you know, a nobody with a story to tell. Popular, notorious or insignificant. The fact I have my hands bound, face covered, stuck alone here means I have a story to tell. I was donating money to charity, when I felt a prick in my neck. Next thing I know, I'm tied up here, surrounded by... three idiots. I needed my medication, and when I didn't get it... my body reacted. [light flickers] Just break the fucking lightbulb, okay? I'll do angel dust for it. [glass breaks] [Isabella] Don't judge me. Which brings me back to now. I can't tell day... or night. I was bored and these idiots didn't know a thing about violence, so... I made their lives a living hell. I might have overdone it. No matter what happens, I will survive this. The hood on means they are protecting their identity. They are protecting their plan. They are protecting their lives. They don't want me dead. Guys, I didn't see anything. [Nitro] Look at me. - [choking] - Look at me. Say my name. [intense music plays] [choking] [heavy breathing] I'm sorry. I haven't been myself, okay? I didn't mean what I said. It's this place. It's this house, okay? It's eating into my head. You're blaming the house now? It's just... Your friends... They were taking care of me, vomit and all, and I got spoiled. Pissed that you weren't doing the same. I'm giving you Isabella Contini. [camera click] [Isabella] I'm a good person. I have no excuse to have disrespected you. [Nitro] But you did. And now you see my face. You will die. [creepy music plays] I am a movie star. I can make your dreams come true. You were a movie star. Me dead is not going to help anyone. My fans need me. I save lives. [laughs] Don't tell me you believe that shit. Please don't kill me. It's been 13 motherfucking days. 13 days? Done talking, your Majesty. [Diamond] The wallet hungers for the bounty. [Nitro] Fuck! [Nitro] It was supposed to be a two day job. We sent the ransom note, her mother wires us the money. It's been 13 days. It's just 13 days. 13 fucking days. We asked the mother not to tell the cops. The woman has been seen on every TV station that would have her. - Step backs... - With what? It's over, Diamond. Stay calm. Be calm. If we get the money, the cops are going to be on the bills like flies on shit. All she got to do is point to the deal and we are made. We are not murderers. Four weeks ago, we weren't kidnappers either. We are looking at 20 to life the minute she walks through that door. You wanted this. You wanted this shit. This is about Aiko. I should have known that. You just signed your divorce papers. Signed my divorce papers? How do you know that? - Platinum. - How does he know that? - You didn't tell him? - I didn't tell anyone. Anyways, I don't care, it doesn't brother me. It was 12 years of your life. It takes more than a signature to sign that away. [Nitro] So, what are we going to do now? You want to kill me? We don't have a choice. We don't have a damn choice. - You always have a choice. - You know what we look like. 'Cause you took the hood off. You shouldn't have called me a nigger. I would never say that. - Did you just call me a liar? - [Isabella] No. No. So, you said it. Let our blood temperatures chill. We are chill. No, my friend, our rage has overtaken our logic. I'll say it. Do you want me to say I said the N word? - I'm sorry. - Emotional aura clouds the gravity of words. Really, Platinum. Gravity of word? We should row on calmer waters. Everything is dandy on these waters. Perspective overshadow ire. She is our ticket out of the weight of unpaid responsibilities. If she meets a sudden demise, the months of planning are all for naught. What the fuck are you saying? [Isabella] Hey. It's me. I said the word. I'm the one that's going. Typical damsel in distress. Honestly, I'm not sure why. Deep down, every guy wants to rescue every girl he wants to fuck. The parasite is probably a barista who has a script to share. Pathetic. Aw, token black guy. I underestimated how emotionally fragile he was. Quick to pull the race card. Wannabe gangster. Out of this whole... disorganized crew... the only one that doesn't want to fuck me. [sniffs] [sighs] I know what you're thinking. Let me ask you. Not the person beside you, but you. How many women do you know that look like me, who marry men like that? Richer, more famous, successful, or have a brilliant career, huh? Let me guess. None. And that, my dear friends, is why men like these want to fuck a woman like me. Anyway... say your prayers and tighten your shoelaces. It's going to be a long day. [Nitro] We have no choice in the matter. Isabella must die. Let quiet minds focus on the bounty we can gain. Let quiet minds focus on what? The word nigger means nothing to you? The N words power is dependent upon the beholder. You selfish prick. The only thing you give a damn about is yourself. Art thou attempting to enrage me? You need sharper words. Then again, the only word that matters to the people of worth, and you are worth nothing. What did you call me? It starts with an "N" and rhymes with rotten. Nothing. I called you a nothing. Fuck you! You livid in son of whore. Shut up, Nitro. Don't make this... Time travel from this Shakespearean era. You are nothing. You were born nothing. You will die nothing. I'm not the one trying to get a washed up actress to help me sell my book. Walk away. Just walk away. Walk away from a fight? No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not my style. Let's even things out. Platinum, why don't you pull out your gun? Shut up, Nitro. Go on, then. Take it out, pull the trigger. You know you want to. Shut up, Nitro, this isn't the place for your bullshit. This is so amateur hour. [Diamond] Platinum, calm down. Seriously, couples have fucked and started developing a baby in the amount of time it takes this guy to decide to fight. Even I know this parasite isn't going to engage. [Diamond] Platinum, calm down. I got to pee. [liquid pours] We did everything we could to get out. I played the right actors in this game of life... - The Chubb illusion. - [Platinum] Yeah. Yes. The Chubb illusion. It reveals that apparent contrasts of an object will vary depending on the context around the presentation. I know what it means. The only reason I got involved was to... To secure funds for a Mandarin copy of my book. What's the title? Enemies On the Throne. It's about my life, you know. I'm really intrigued. I'd probably turn it into a movie. You're gonna turn your book and do a movie? Yes, yes. Yes. Yes, I will. His book is his life. And Isabella. Isabella in his head is his chance at life for the book. His book is the only thing that justifies him being... Better than all of us. He's desperate. So are we. But let's not forget, she might be cute, sexy and nice, but she got bazookas that can blow us up anytime. - [chuckles] - Bazooka Bella. Ready to blow us up any time now. - Any time now. - [chuckles] ♪ Any time. Aiko woke me up at 3:30 AM... and in her softest, kindest voice she told me to get out... and told me our marriage is over. - Nitro was married. - [Isabella] To a man? [Platinum] No, to a woman. Oh. Was? He's divorced. He is a loquacious coq au fuego. I don't know what that means, but I agree with you. I never said the N word. I believe you. He's a creature of necessity. More like elements of necessity. Platinum, Diamond, Nitro, all elements of the periodic table. I said creature of necessity. Creatures of necessity sounds better. Divorce seems to have ripped off a fair chunk of his soul. So, she must be a real tool to have married someone like him. Ex-wife. And she isn't a tool. She's one of those... She's one of those rare gems that you experience just once in a lifetime. How? She's like you. But, uh... you are a movie star. She walks into a room and the room stops. - You're fucking her. - Absolutely not. [Isabella] But you love her. It's okay. Your secret's safe with me. No, we're just good friends. Call me Bella. My friends call me Bella. [Platinum] Bella. Your art is real. It justifies your immortality. As a child, I cried watching you sing Waiting For the Moon in The Last Sunset. You really do know my work. The Last Sunset... I almost wish I never did that picture. After it, money became my top priority. None of my other films mattered after that. They matter to me. The smidgen of time you gave to [indistinct] made that movie perfect. I used to matter. People wanted to work with me, wanted to take my picture. Now, the only way I get my picture in the news is through a mugshot. I will always be habituated to the work you've left behind. [heart beats] [Isabella] There is an undeniable amount of power to being on top. Makes you invincible. He absorbed the weaknesses of others and it become their strength. Makes you so much taller than what you are. Their pain, sorrow, failure is what I feed on to rise. Even the littlest gesture could awaken the... strength of anyone around me. I want to take the best of you... and make it a piece of me. This is... this is not good. Oh, this is very bad. But a good amount of bad is the same thing as a bad amount of good. Let yourself go. ♪ [Nitro] What the fuck? [Platinum] This is not what you think. Your tongue was in her mouth and your hand was grabbing her ass. Her naked ass if I might add. Yes, I know how it might seem. The perspective is deceiving. Think, we just added attempted rape charges against you. I didn't force myself on her. It was mutual consent. Except she's in this house out of her consent. [Isabella] Relax, Platinum and I were just talking. Nothing happened. He has a boner sharper than the Eiffel Tower. We're just talking. Wait, wait, wait, so all that drama earlier was just to get in her pants. [smacking lips] Where the fuck do you think you're going? To my chair. To be tied up like the prisoner I am. Nothing happened. Sure, nothing happened. [metal clanking] - [Isabella] I'm all yours. - [Nitro laughing] [Nitro] Hey, guess what, guess what? Platinum got caught waving his dick over her just so he can make out with her in the bathroom. Your humor is sublime. You realize that's rape, rape? Exactly what I said. We were consenting adults.

I made the move. - Why? - What do you mean, why? It's an honest question. Why did you make the first move? Did she do it to survive? Or were you just so sexy she couldn't resist? Don't answer the question, Miss Contini. We need to focus on our next move. - The next move. - There's only one thing left. Isabella must die. You don't have to kill me. We're open to ideas. Look, I understand why you're doing this, okay? I know how you people feel. Isabella must die. Look... you all talked to my mother, right? You never once let me talk to her. Let me call her.

You have the power. It's extremely intriguing to see how weak a man really is when he's dependent on a gun. Look at this fool. He can't shoot me. He's not capable of killing anyone. So, what does he do? He uses the gun to try and humiliate me. You think you got this figured out? You're the big, bad man with the gun. You think I can't kill you? I can't take this anymore. That's not true. I believe that you're a sad, poor, little boy whose only strength comes from the weapon in his hand. You can't kill me.

If I can have anyone killed, I would have had you killed an hour ago. Why are you letting me go?

The Senator you work for? What's his name? You realize how dumb it'd be for me to answer that question, right? My mother's third husband is Senator Grummer. Would be a wild coincidence if you worked for him. So you believe your mother's ex-husband who is a sitting senator decides to hire us to kidnap you because? I never told you they were divorced. You're seeming to forget you're about to die. Yeah. Sorry. Please indulge me. How much was the ransom? A hundred million. Where did you think my mother would find that kind of money? A million? A million. The woman didn't cave. To save our face we told her we meant a million pesos. - Pesos? - She didn't bulge. I mean, even worse, the news had you missing, not kidnapped. Pesos?

Isabella perched on her throne. Nitro, help me to understand. Why the fuck did you let her go? Why did he let me go? [Platinum] You had no intention of killing her from the start. You expected us to say no. You wanted us to say no. - That doesn't make sense. - I took the fucking hood off. I'm the smartest person in this room, and I literally don't know what that means. The minute I took the hood off I killed her because of... Aiko, I played God. I can't even make my marriage work. I live in a shoe box. I lost my home. I lost my kids. Lost custody of the damn dog.

Yes, it was. She doesn't have to die. Choices are for nought. Choices is what choices are. [Diamond] What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I don't know what it fucking means.

What's the alternative? We have two dead bodies over here? There'd only be one dead body in here. Fratricide isn't in him. Sorry, brother, but I can't have the blood of an innocent woman carrying on my conscious. Innocent? This drug addict? A woman so repugnant her own mother doesn't want to pay her ransom. Fucking fairweather fans. I took the hood off. Her life belongs to me until she walks away from here. You will not kill me.

Keeping her company when I worked overtime to pay for the big, fancy house, she'd like to show off to her friends. Platinum, tell him it's not true. It's not true.

It's out there. She knows our fucking names. Tell him so we can move past this. We need to move past this. Seven minutes. You seem disappointed, George. What do you expect? You thought he would repeat what you said? It's easy for a man to steal someone's wife when she comes to you as the hero. And she tells you how much she's suffering under her mean husband. And in a bedroom, she gives 100% of herself to her hero while her evil husband isn't there. A cheating wife always chooses her love with precision. Secrecy is very important. That's why our friend is always the perfect target. Five minutes. Before I signed my divorce papers, I waited outside my house for the adulterer. He never came out, so I went in. [Platinum] Kevin, let's talk about this some other time. Patience. I'm getting to the best part. The plan was to kill her and shoot myself. I climb on our bed, put my hands around her neck. She opened her eyes. She doesn't scream. She looks at me. I love that woman so much and that bitch knew it. She slapped my ass off and she fucks the shit out of me. Oh, she didn't tell you, did she? She came so many times that night. She was screaming so loud... [sighing] I had to let her bite my hand so she wouldn't wake up the kids. You lie! You lie? Is that all you got? Or did you run out of fancy words? You want to die. You really want to die? You know why I signed my divorce papers? She said because, "Let me go and I'll come back to you." [Diamond] Please.

"Saturday," I asked? He said, "It is when people kill... fornicate... and sin the most in clubs, parties and motels. They are disobeying the fourth commandment. The Sabbath day is on a Saturday, not Sunday." He was so proud of his theory. I didn't have the heart to tell him that most suicides happen on a Monday, murders on a Sunday, copulations on a Sunday. Anyway, forgive me. I am 32 seconds early and wanted to make an entrance. Now, I will need a dollar from one of you before we begin. Why? Attorney client privilege. So please, correct me if I'm wrong. You three, fine gentlemen kidnapped Miss Contini, hoping to get a ransom of $1,000,000. But, her mother doesn't want to pay. With the world looking for her and your identities revealed, it has led to an animus decision on whether she lives or dies. So, is that our dilemma? - [Diamond] Yes. - Great. You get the family discount. $5,000 per hour. Hopefully, we should be out of here within the hour. [Nitro] Who the hell is this guy?

All three of you together get just one. And that was it. Do you understand? [sighs] You hold on to it for now. Your hour has begun, gentlemen. I prefer cash, but I also accept PayPal or Venmo as long as it's less than ten grand a transaction. Now, you do realize I'm not the kind of person you don't pay on time? Yes, sir. We were hoping to pay you after we get the... Would the end of the hour be good? Absolutely, George Ramos, Kevin Hill and Perry Washington. I actually need some alone time with Miss Contini here. Please don't leave me alone. [Prince] Don't be ridiculous, Isabella. In the words of Leonardo da Vinci, "While I thought I was learning how to live, I have actually been learning how to die." Quick. Go out and talk. Don't put this shit on me. Not on me. We all agreed to get him. Our names are in his pocket. The way he took the gun was some Equalizer shit. He knows my last name. He just took the gun in my hand. I didn't give him any names. No names. I don't know how he knew about you two. Is he serious? Five grand an hour? Dude took it out of my hand before I could even blink. The whole five grand thing doesn't ring true. Five grand is nothing to someone like him. - Could be a favor to you. - No, no, it isn't. He just took the gun in my hand before I realized I had. Okay, enough about the gun. We need to focus on the five grand. Nitro and I bring in 1700 each, you bring 16. - [Platinum] Sixteen? Well... - That's a lot of money. I mean, he is an attorney. He can't be that dangerous. Now, you forget the equalizer shit. You don't know the Dinesh Robert story? - Date raped by three frat boys. - Her father. Father was a council member who wanted to run for Congress. Frat boys had kingmakers for parents. Two billionaire donors and a senator. Father shots his daughter, shuts her up. Case closes. He becomes congressman. Two years later, the girl gives up the necessity of survival. - She kills herself. - Someone hires the Prince. Someone hires the prince. First frat boy is in an asylum, unable to understand a single sentence. Everybody thinks he smokes the wrong kind of drugs. [Diamond] Second one, paralyzed from the neck down. They said he was drinking and driving. - And the last one? - [Diamond] Wasn't subtle. Wasn't subtle. He woke up one morning, one sunny morning, and he didn't have a penis. - They took his dick off? - [Diamond] Yup, took it off. Clean off. Just stitches remain. How do I transfer 1,700 to your account? Cover me. You know I'm good for it. No, you aren't. This is a life and death situation. He will kill me if I don't pay. You screwed up my credit twice. I told you that never, never again. You are so melodramatic. Kevin, help me out. First, you fuck my wife, destroy my marriage, architect my fall to poverty, then you want me to pay your fucking bill? I can't wait 'til he kills all of us. It was just a suggestion. We're all brainstorming here. - But not with your credit card. - I don't have a credit card. How the hell do you know this Prince? He's married to Camilla's sister. That's great. He's married to your fiancée's sister? Tell Camilla to ask her sister to ask her husband to give us some time with the five grand. - No. - What do you mean, no? Not telling my fiancée that I kidnapped anyone. No one. George, unless you have my share of the five grand, our lives are as good as forfeit. You need to call Camilla. No, I won't sacrifice my chance of happiness for this. You carry your own cross. Your cross. If she loves you, she'll understand. [Diamond] What do you know about love? You have nobody depending on you. Say what you want to say about me, but the problem we face is as a trinity and it must be paid. Trinity. Really? More like the both of us, as usual. It's the only logical conclusion at this point in time. - You are full of shit. - It is what it is. - No, it isn't. - Okay. Maybe my words are missing their mark, so I'll try to be blunt. I don't have 1600. [Diamond] Yeah, but the thing is, if we get only 3400, I'm going to have to tell the Prince that you don't want to pay him. - You realize he will kill me? - There's only so much I can do. And risk Camila of finding out about your dark dalliance? She wouldn't find out. The Prince will kill you and we'll make up the rest after you're dead. - You jest. - I'm not laughing. Don't sink to his insidious level. This is one tab. One tab you would have to cover your own. - You're both dead to me. - Good riddance. Did I mention that I fucked your wife in the kitchen, the bedroom, the living room, and your kids room? I know what I'm going to do. I'm gonna get my share from the sweet, large alimony you gave to my Aiko. [phone ringing] How's my sweet buttercup doing today? [Aiko] Hello, lover. It has been a crazy day, my love. I wish you could be here with me. - [Aiko] Me too. - How does it feel to finally be free of that quicksand of a man? [Aiko] I'm lucky to have you. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No more tears, my love. That dark, devouring chapter of your life is in the past. Divine happiness is our future. [Aiko] You are the best thing to happen to me. My life truly began the first time I saw you. Hey, babe. I need $1,600 to tidy a few things up. Hello? Aiko, are you still there? [Aiko] Yes. I got distracted. - So? - [Aiko] So. The 1600. I promise to pay it back by the end of the month. [Aiko] Where the heck am I going to get that kind of money? You just got a $73,000 lump alimony settlement. I'm not asking for much. [Aiko] I'm a single mother with two children. - I can't start off wasting. - Wasting? Aiko, I'm coming to you because you are my heart. [Aiko] Hello? Hello? P... Perry, I can't seem to hear you. I can hear you fine. [Aiko] This signal seems bad. I'll get back to you. - Aiko, I... - [phone beeping] It's probably the signal. [Kevin laughs] Wow. I swear I didn't see that coming. [Diamond] This is getting very depressing. Very depressing. For the love of anything holy, - please don't call her back... - I'm not calling his wife. Wait, wait, wait. Ex-wife. [Diamond] So, who are you calling? None of your fucking business, you pathetic quisling. [The Prince] Feel free to ask me anything. [chair scrapes] Are you a Prince? No. I was a Nigerian with an accent in an American college at a time when fraudulent emails from a number of people claiming to be Nigerian princes were asking for money. Okay. - Any more questions? - Yeah. Are they going to kill me? No. Everyone thinks they can kill another human being until the reality of taking one's life is a split second away. They don't have it in them. - Do you have it in you? - You do. Me? Kill someone? Anyone? No. And you? It's like sex. As a virgin, you have a lot to protect. Once you've been deflowered, it gets easier. Are you going to kill me? Everything I say might be the truth or a lie. The goal is to get a deal everyone can be happy with. Look at it on the bright side. There is a strong chance you get to leave here back to your three bedroom condo. You know where I live? In five minutes, a kid in his pajamas typed his keyboard. I got your Social Security number, your pharmacist, where your mother has your money stashed up and your STD results. What? How? - It's okay. - How? I know about everyone. Information is the new oil. My STD result? Oral herpes. Nothing to be ashamed of. 50 to 80% of American adults have it. [The Prince sighs] Your friends call you Bella. - May I call you that? - No. My wife has only one rule. As long as we're in the same zip code, we have dinner together. So, if I don't leave here early, she'll be waiting out for me. And I don't want her waiting out for me. What do you want me to agree to? I don't want you to agree to everything I propose. I want to make you happy. Happy? I'm tied to a chair. In front of me is an assassin with two loaded weapons. I will agree to anything you tell me. I am not an assassin. You just kill people if they don't agree with you 100%. [whispering] Why can't I get my mouth to shut up? Am I trying to kill myself? [The Prince] I'm a businessman and an officer of the court. [dagger shinging] I don't kill people. I am positive you walk out of here with a smile. [rope snapping] [Isabella sighing] Yeah, right. He wants me to run so he could shoot me in the back. I'm sitting my butt here. I don't want you thinking I'm going to shoot you in the back. [Isabella] Is this psychopath reading my thoughts? So... The million dollar question. How do we get you to walk out of here, pay $1,000,000 to your kidnappers with a smile on your face? So how? [The Prince] Okay, good. Hopefully we're over me being a psychopath. Am I going crazy? I mean I'm still detoxing or something. Honestly. Who the fuck am I talking to? Is someone out there? [thudding] There are three factions to this. First, getting $1,000,000 from you, paying off your inexperienced kidnappers, and lastly, making that million worth ten times more for you. If they're paying you five grand, what stops you from just killing us all and taking the million? [The Prince] I got to where I am because my name comes with integrity. If I stifled anyone, I'll be out of his business in a month. Also, I am in a 1% tax bracket. And you get paid five grand an hour. [The Prince] Actually, I get 10%, a sort of five grand thing to get him out. I wanted to be here alone with you. Why? [The Prince] We'll get to that. So, how do we get $1,000,000 in the next 30 minutes? I can give you the million dollars. [Isabella] A million? You have no idea the kind of shit I've done to remain relevant. Well, I'm not interested in having sex with you for $1,000,000. Yes, I know. One can tell when a man wants to fuck her. What do you want? 25% interest in three months. [Isabella] How are you sure I'd pay it back? In 10 minutes, I found out your address. You have herpes. You have a hidden account in the Cayman Islands. As long as you're alive, I'll get my money back on time. Okay. If we can just stop talking about herpes. I can transfer the money. Your mother closed your account. [Isabella] I don't understand. She cleared it up. Even better. She's misdirecting the cops of your missing story. That's why the cops aren't looking for kidnappers. [Isabella laughing] I'm her own flesh and blood. [Isabella sobbing] Once you're sat at the top, you do anything to get back there. She's on the news. You're niche. She's mainstream now. You know, I still remember her face when I won the Oscar. 12 year old prodigy. She hated me for it. We worked on that picture together. It was supposed to be her big comeback. Instead, I won. Do you have the money or not? I owe the IRS 15 million. That's why I was stashing everything away in the Cayman Islands. My wife's dinner is getting cold. You need to make a decision. - I don't have the money. - I offered you the money. [Isabella] How would I ever pay you back? You'd be in a better place by the end of our meeting. No. I can't agree to something I don't understand. What differentiates a great actor from a good actor? Human beings start acting immediately they're born, but a great actor makes you believe every word that comes out of their mouth. When a great actor tells you the aliens are coming, you believe the aliens are coming. Is he teaching me about acting? The second youngest Oscar winner ever? Bear with me. The problem is you didn't make us believe in your words. You didn't lock us in with your words. Great. What do I know about acting with words? That you were not where you were supposed to be. You were too busy going for pop movies. I won an Oscar for the Lost Sunset. You were a 12 year old singing and acting the same year your father died, with a mother everyone knew was at the end of her twilight. Even Kermit the Frog would have gotten an Oscar under the same circumstance. I worked hard for that Oscar. I deserved it! Deserved it? Deserving is Peter O'Toole, Glenn Close, Angela Bassett, - And indeed... - You know what? I don't come to your place of work and tell you that you killed someone the wrong way. - Edward Norton. Tom Cruise. - That's bullshit. [tense music] My job is not to kill people. Your job is to entertain your audience with your movies. If I paid 14 bucks to watch your movies, I have every right to criticize it. - Then don't watch my movie. - That's the problem! Nobody watches them anymore. I don't need you to watch them. We Bleed Red. So, you do watch my movies. I didn't watch it because of you. But the 10 minutes you were in it, is the reason I'm here right now. ♪ Walk with me. [Isabella] This is the part where you tell me where I fit into your stupid story. [The Prince] I go to a Hollywood party and Zhang Hyang harasses me to read this script, Queens of the Revolution. You know Zhang Hyang? Yes, I invested in We Bleed Red. I was in it. You funded my movie. Your movie? Let's not push liberties. You weren't in the top 50 billing. - It was a team effort. - Sure. Keep telling yourself that. I didn't see your name in the billing. Because it wasn't there. Anyway, I read a script and immediately I'm thinking, "Danai Gurira, Tika Sumpter or Yvonne Orji?" Yes, the lead actress is Black. Of course, she isn't. But you just named all Black actresses. It was my 10 million on the line. I was picking who I wanted. - Really? Ten million? - Can I finish my story? Yeah, sorry. Then I got a call from Zhang that he's met with Chiwetel Ejiofor, and he wants him to play the lead role. The studio feels two Black leads make it a Black movie. - I kind of see their point. - Of course you do. Anyway, then I get a call you're here, I push your name with Zhang and he likes the idea. - For... for what role? - Jeno Shion, the lead. [swelling music] - The lead? - Yeah. Why? I'm not shitting on this. I will do a porn if... if Zhang was directing it, but... this can't be real. It is. It is very real. I thought that Zhang didn't notice me. [stammers] I mean, he directed it. But why would he remember me? Why would anyone want me? I'm a has been. Both he and I were blown away by your ten minutes. It was raw. It was real. And most importantly, you are trending. - Trending. I'm trending. - Mm hmm. You're on every news channel, foreign and abroad. You can't buy that kind of publicity. The role is yours if you want it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah... But I have to ask, the drugs? - Zhang's old school. - Oh, it's just uppers. It won't affect my work. - You were binging on coke. - I've crashed since then. 13 days tied up here, puking, sleeping, those punks have done what no rehab facility has been able to do. I'm clean. It seems like a perfect day then. And the million? That can wait 'til after you get paid. They're going to pay me a lot more than a million. Holy shit, I'd do this for free. Isabella Contini, you're the it girl now. Those three men out there have done for you what people would kill for. Huh? Before I received this call, I could have sworn you planned the whole thing. And I applauded it as a master comeback. The world is in your cage, own it or it will come back to devour you. Never a victim. Nobody worships the victim. You are the goddess right now. How do I explain all of this? That's the best part. You don't. - I don't? - You walk out of here. We drop you with a hood over your head close to the police station. You walk in face bloodied. Don't tell them anything about this. I refuse to say anything. It will be remembered for years to come as a trauma you refuse to share. - Not even with a shrink. - So, I'm selling a mystery. Make the world wonder, "Was she beaten, raped, tortured? Did they kill any other part of her?" You will be the hot cheerleader. Everyone will want to get into your panties. And talk shows. Tell Ellen everything except what happened. I've always wanted to be on Ellen. She will beg for an exclusive. The cops, they might want to involve the feds. You're not obligated to tell them anything. As long as you don't lie, you haven't committed a crime. They're going to want to run a rape kit. Let them know it's too traumatic. You don't want anyone touching you. You want to go home, shower, burn your clothes, and go to bed. My face, my body. These fuckers didn't leave a scratch on me. We'll get one of them to do a touch up job on you. I doubt these pussies could even kill a spider. You're going to have to do it. Follow me. ♪ Screw you! [glass breaking] Mommy didn't give you any money? Okay. Whoa! What are you doing? All right, Musketeers, no more mommy banter, no more loser jokes. I was your brother. I had your back for decades. Not months, not years. Decades. What did I ask for? A measly $1600. Then you humiliate me over 1600 dollars! Brothers don't screw each other's wives. - That is beside the point. - That is the point. I have the gun in my hand, so shut up and listen. I need the two of you to lend me $1600. I'd rather die from your bullet than lend you a dollar. You're still emotional, so I'm going to - give you time to cool off. - No, no. - What do you mean, no? - You still owe me. I have the gun in my hands. - Oh, is this a robbery? - It's a negotiation. - With the gun in your hand? - The Prince will kill me if I don't give him the money. It's about the principle. The principle. You asked me to co-sign for your rent and car. I did. Now, I find myself paying for both. This is different, George. It's my life on the line. It's about the principle, Perry, the principle. You came to me in debt up to your eyeballs and asked me for my help with the abduction. I didn't blink an eye to abet you. That's a load of shit. A load of shit. You're here because of a third of $1,000,000. We were supposed to be brothers. You aren't my brother! You've always been a vile human being to me and to your ex-wife. I'm happy that justifies what you did. Poor Aiko. She had to deal with your bitching about your work hours while she slaved away for your children. - Don't mention my children. - You want know the truth? I'm a better father to your children. Hear my words clearly. You and I are done! We were done the minute you kicked me off your mansion. Fuck you. Fuck both of you. - Yeah. - Right, blame us all for your inability to handle the truth. The truth? I'll call Camila right now and let her know that you're nothing but a miscreant. Kidnapping poor, innocent girls from the street. - What are you waiting for? - George, no! No, no. He will call Camila now. He will tell my fiancée the truth. You know I can't call. I smashed my phone. This whole plan reeks of sabotage. How the hell did the Prince get here in ten minutes? We're in the middle of nowhere. You both think you're so special. You're nothing in this world. You'll be forgotten in less than a generation. Screw both of you. ♪ I need to talk to you. It is ill advised to point a gun at a man, unless you are ready to pull the... You will listen as I speak. Or what? You know, everyone needs to stop messing with me. I will shoot the gun if I have to. - Drop the gun, you fool. - Who are you calling a fool? [The Prince] Point the gun back at me. You will let me pay my 1600 in a month's time. Are you telling me or are you asking me? Actually, two months, motherfucker. [phone rings] Don't pick up the fucking phone. Yeah, mmm-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here with her now. Talking with her. Yeah. Mmm hmm. Yeah. Talking with her now. - It's looking good. - Hang up the fucking phone. Yeah. Let me confirm. Your agent's Will Shorsky, right? Okay. - Send a document. - You will respect me. You fucking nigger. Let me call you back. You now have my undivided attention. Stay where you are. In the year 1640, three indentured servants try and escape their employers. They get caught. The judge listens to the case from all three men and sentences only one, John Punch, the Black one, to a life of servitude to the Virginia planter, Hugh Gwynn for the rest of his life. That is how racism became legal in America. Just by a judge looking at a man who didn't look like him and sentenced him. I'm warning you to stop. Most people would say, the white man who shouts "nigger," is the biggest racist. But now, I happen to like the way of the alt right. They don't like me. They don't like my children. They don't like my progress. And they don't hide behind the etiquette of society. Don't fucking come any closer. Now, the enemies the Black man needs to fear are the ones with smiles on their faces who see the progress of the war on their throne. I swear I will shoot you if you come any closer. They are quick to try to make us forget that Henry Boyd created the bed. Stay the fuck back. Garrett Morgan created the gas mask and the traffic lights. Charles Drew, the blood bank. Alice Parker, the gas heating furnace. Mary Davidson, the sanitary belt. Philip Emeagwali, the supercomputer. For the last time, stay the fuck away from me. But this is my favorite, three teenage girls in Africa create a pee power generator. And all of a sudden, Ivy League professors come out and say to the world peeing on a generator is not a big deal to create, even though it has never been created before. And you call me nigger. Me! Born of a history older than Christianity, eh? Older than the Greek Empire. Older than the Torah. Of a time [indistinct] before man to walk on two legs, eh? You cultureless baboon. You are a worthless nothing. [gun fires] ♪ [Isabella] What have you done? Please take it. Somebody please take the fucking gun from me. Put it on the floor. [breathing quickly] He just came at me. - It happened so fast. - [Isabella] No, he didn't. He called me a nothing. Yeah, and that's why you shot him, you psychopath! It was an accident. The Prince had everything figured out, - you stupid asshole. - Don't call me stupid. What are you going to do about it, huh? - You stupid asshole. - George! How are you going to let her talk to me like that? His name's Diamond. Be fucking professional. I'm not supposed to know your names. I know this is beside the point, but why isn't she tied up? Really? That's what you're concerned about? Not the dead body on the ground? It's a question, a simple question. I suggest we all walk away. Somebody else will find the body. Excellent plan, Einstein. The only problem is my key code. My fucking key code shows I was the last person to show this place. Well, why don't you just tell the cops you were oblivious to everything? Let's face it, nobody seems to care that much about finding missing Black kids, not to mention hunting down the killer of some gang banger. You must be so proud of yourself. I am a writer, I have a very fertile imagination. We need to call the cops and tell them everything that happened. You want to go to jail? You want to get raped in jail by a hairy gorilla named Bruno? I say we vote it in. I'm not going to fucking jail. So, we know your vote. One for the cop, and one against George. George? George. Think about Camilla. Think about the wedding. Think about the man you want to be for Camilla. Ah... I say we call the cops. - [Nitro] Yes! - Wait. - She gets a vote, too! - [Nitro] Are you serious? She already had everything figured out with the Prince. It's over, Perry. We're calling the cops. We're calling the cops. I vote against calling the cops. What do you mean we vote against? It means she doesn't want us going to the cops. That's eight years without your families. And, yes, you'd both get raped in prison. Why do you care? You walk away the victim. That's the problem. The victim. What's the story, huh? I get taken by three inexperienced kidnappers who kill a guy, call the cops, and let me go? Sounds as ridiculous as you three. Now, I control the narrative. Now, the world is in my cage. I own it. I have no idea what that meant. Me neither, but who cares? I like where this is going. Let's just take kidnapping off the table. - The Prince has resolved it. - How? None of your damn business. Well, I think it is. We are all in this together. No, Nitro. This is me helping you with your friend's stupid choice. - Don't call me stupid. - He is not my friend. I don't give a shit what he is to you. The only thing I know is the only thing between us and walking out that door is this dead body. ♪ More like stopping three of us. Isabella, what are you doing here? Walk out that door. You have done nothing wrong. Go. Go, Miss Contini. This is not your cross to carry. ♪ There's a dead body on the ground. How do we handle it? We're surrounded by trees. We could dig a hole, dump the body in there. Nobody would ever find it. Have you ever met Camilla's sister? No. Well, she would burn this whole city to ashes looking for her husband. Never underestimate the length a wife will go for the love of her husband. This goes way beyond love. You think he was scary? You haven't met Francesca Ortega. Great. Someone new to weigh on our dilemma. - I got a story. - [Diamond] What? What story? George and I walked in and saw Perry shot the Prince. I go down, we all go down. You must have missed the memo, Perry. - There was no kidnapping here. - [Isabella] For the love of God. Stick to Nitro, Platinum, and Diamond. No fucking real names. Were you kidnapped, Miss Contini? No. I think we have a story here. Let's say what this is really about. This is about Aiko. If it hadn't been me, it would have been anyone else off the street. But, it was you. You I would have taken a bullet for. Don't play broke or ignorant, you knew a divorce was coming. You had $73,000 stashed to pay Aiko off. And to you that makes everything okay? Well, Miss Contini, we seem to be in a bit of a bind because the last person the Prince talked to knew he was with you and wait for it, it might have been Francesca Ortega. Not to mention your prints are all over the place. So, I advise you to reconsider if you were ever here. - But you killed him. - [Platinum] Yes, I did. But the question for the judge and the jury will be, did I do it alone? God knows, I might have to be the star witness for the prosecution, letting them know how Isabella made me do it. [Diamond] For once, Perry, handle your responsibility. Stop telling me your fucking names. [Platinum] I just remembered another sweet, juicy detail. Your fingerprints are also on the gun. I didn't kill anyone. No one. Yeah, but it confirms the story. Who knows? Maybe I was forced to do it by the angry black man and his gay lover who both wanted to impress the movie star. - I'm gay now. - What do you want? I want... No, I need for us to figure out how to flush this shit out! You two faced bastard. Forgive me, George, if I want to fucking survive. Let's chill. Let's chill. The only thing we have to worry about is the Prince. [Platinum] So, it would seem. We can't bury him because his wife might dig around and somehow find out the truth. - Yes. - Yes. [Nitro] So our solution... we let the world see the man shot to death. At the same time, we exonerate ourselves. We can't be accessories to his murder. This is progress, three Musketeers doing our thing. [Platinum] I've got it. The Prince came in here trying to rape and murder Isabella, and I shot him. Nice touch with the rape. A man like me saving her from a man like him. The press and the cops, they would love it. And you raise the hero the world has been looking for. Everybody needs a hero to look up to. One tiny thing. - What's that? - Francesca Ortega. [Platinum] Again, with this woman. The evidence is there, her husband is an attempted rapist. We all saw it. Hiding the body is the better plan compared to this because Francesca Ortega will find us, torture us, and kill us in ways that we have never imagined. [Platinum] Screw this. If she was so dangerous, why have I never heard of her before? You told us about the Prince. Why not his dangerous wife? Because some things are safer not said. ♪ I have a story to tell. Please tell. We're at the denouement. This house? Is it on the market? [Diamond] Yes. - Yes, I'm the realtor. - Perfect. You brought me in for a showing. I really liked the house and I thought about buying it. Loving the story already. What? What are you doing? Trying to get an estimate of the distance from where the bullet was fired to where he got shot. There's nothing like a woman with meat in her brains. [Isabella] Okay, so you bring me in for a showing. You already said that. What next? How did you guys meet? No phone records, no emails. My office. You just walked in and demanded to see this property from my catalog. Yes, but unknown to us, this dude, let's call him Mr. X, follows me. [Platinum] I like it. He follows you. So you show me the house, take me home, Mr. X follows me. He attacks me. I fight back but he overpowers me. Maybe Mr. X injected you with a sleeping drug. [Isabella] Is that how you guys got me here? [Diamond] Not our proudest moment. [Nitro] But this ties George to the place. Why didn't he call the cops? I wasn't aware I was the last person she met. She was reported missing two days after. Okay, that might fly. The stalker biz might work too. Celebrities have a lot of them. Hmm, hmm. We sure do. I mean she sure does. So, the stalker brings me back here. He tied me up. How did he get in without breaking in? You need a key code to get into this place. Uh, he must've snuck in while we were browsing this place and left a window open. Too premeditated. The cops wouldn't think of that. It was probably another realtor. Another realtor that has the key code. If he used your key code, it's someone that knew you. Let's move on. We'll come back to that. What happened after he tied you up here? Um, he did everything you guys did. What's his motive? What did he want with you? Same thing every crazy fan wants. He sees me on TV, thinks he knows me. He believes that we belong together, that we deserve to work together. The whole fan in love with the star story is a little ordinary. I agree. We need to spice Mr. X up a little bit. He wants to convert his dreams to reality. He needs to tap into your being. He wants to figure out the mosaic of your soul. How? He studied you. He asked you questions. He needed to understand what you felt when you did a scene. Your addictions, your sorrows, your woes. Okay. That works. Did Mr. X sexually assault you? [Diamond] What's wrong with you? It's a valid question. If she was sexually assaulted, there'd have to be bruises or something to show. No, he didn't. It was more of a mind game. [footsteps] He told me that I would come to him. I was going to beg for his love, beg for his attention. [sniff] I tried. [sniff] But... [sobs] I broke. [gulps] He was right. [sob] So sick... how much I grew to love him. Maybe it was just the essence. How was that? It... it was good. I mean it was true! - Great. - [Diamond exhales] The Prince. How do we factor in Mr. X? [Diamond] Phone records would show I called him today. His wife or whoever was on the phone with him knew he was coming here. And even if he didn't, the GPS in either the car or phone would lead them here. Got it! You said you would meet me here today for a second look at the house. And I promised to make an introduction with the Prince. [Nitro] If the Prince knew Isabella was still missing, - why would still he come? - That's probably why he came. Why he came, he figured she just might show. [Isabella] Yes. Yes. So he comes in, finds me tied up, rescues me. Mr. X comes out of nowhere and shoots him in the chest. I love it. [Isabella] That should cover our tracks. And now, the million dollar question... who is Mr. X? [Platinum] Some wanderer off the street? Can't be. Doesn't justify us getting in the house with George's key code. [Diamond] It has to be someone who the cops would believe has my key code. It has to be someone smart enough... to want more than just my body. Someone who might have prior knowledge of my first showing of this place to Isabella. Someone who would like to work... with you.

[breathing heavy] [plastic rustling] Do you feel like throwing up? No. Why? You just stabbed a man to death multiple times. I don't know. Right now, I just don't feel like it. How do you guys know I'm not going to kill you next? I'm just kidding. I can't justify your deaths. The right answer would be it's inhumane to kill another human being. That's not funny. Yeah.

Hey, Kevin, this truly has been a bonding moment. But I think managing someone like me right now in my career is below your pay grade. If I can manage an idiot like Senator Grummer to win an election, you have nothing to worry about. [fast rewind] My mother's third husband is Senator Grummer. It'd be a wild coincidence if you worked for him. - [gunshot] - [Platinum] You had no intention of killing her from the start. You expected us to say no. You wanted us to say no. Don't play broke or ignorant. You knew a divorce was coming. You had $73,000 stashed to pay Aiko off.
