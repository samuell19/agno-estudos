How dare you taping this? - Cut that out! - Okay, okay You heard me! Give me some This is the best time for horror stories Ever heard about the story of the All Souls' Day? Depends on which year's All Souls' Day, right? Exactly! There is this one concerning... ...my friend's uncle who owns a newsstand On the last All Souls' Day and... right at his stall, he has... ...an encounter! It was past 4 am. Still dark He was piling the papers like usual Hi there, Mr. Chan! Do me a favor! Call an ambulance Granny here... She... she said she's not feeling well... How about that?! Scary?! Hell no Listen to mine! This story happened to the god-sister... ...of my friend's brother They lived at the Jordan Firemen's Quarter It was an evening 2 years ago It was cold... ...about 8 degrees Celsius The god-sister slept till 2am... ...only to hear people drilling outside She thought... how strange It's far too cold and early... ...for the firemen to drill now So she got up to take a look Too bad she did Because...! One of the Japanese soldiers spotted her He yelled at her... pulled out his samurai sword and... ...charged right at her! Was the girl killed? Nah She went nuts afterwards though Listen! There is this true story, super gross! A friend of mine was listening to a ghost story and... She died choking! Cut down the snack or you'll die! Come on! Cheers... cheers! Your horror stories are all second-handed Frankly, 'ever had an encounter before? You guys should read more often! What's that? Huh? This is the 10 ways... ...to encounter ghosts from Thai's ancient rites You can't find this book just anywhere One evening, I took the wrong bus Then got off at the wrong stop A book store was still open So I went in for directions Anyone in? Hello? THE TEN ENCOUNTERS Pay first and read later... hmm... How much is it? It's karma that brings you to this book I'll give you a discount then How about 500 bahts? You must be kidding! Too cheap, aye? Then pay me the full price Here's your 500 Listen up, kiddo Don't you ever turn to the last page of the book Or else misfortune will come to you! You'll regret it if you don't believe me! Still, I cannot avoid misfortune! Don't you ever turn to the last page! Fix Price: 100 bahts Sale Price: 50 baths? Bastard! Moron... Even an old man can fool you! Men, this book is no bullshit though The rituals are authentic And I have 2 real-live cases on hand to back it up! The first one is 'the condemned cornea transplant' The second one is for... ...women only - to attempt suicide while pregnant! I think... ...I've heard these 2 cases previously Me too... You see? What's this? Yoga? It's "Peek-a-stoop", a Thai custom still practiced today! Chongkwai What are the other ways? Let me see Comb your hair at midnight and... ...the ghost you desire will appear in the mirror Next Gees... something wrong with his eyes? The book says Smudge the graveyard soil over your eyes and... ...you'll be exposed to the world of the spirits! Aren't there any... simpler and safer ways? Sure! Simpler way... Open an umbrella indoors You'll score for sure! So you mean If we follow the instructions ...we'll get to see ghosts for sure It depends Different players have... ...different success rates Why not try it out then? Damn right! We sure need a game to get through the night! Well... why not?! Given there are different success rates... ...we might not get to see them after all, right? ...Right Then listen carefully Once the game has started You can't quit playing no matter what happens Or else, misfortune will come to you You've heard me Now let's begin! Let's try the most convenient way! A GLASS OF SPIRIT Thai's "A Glass of Spirit"... Chinese's "Plate Genie" & "Witchy Board" of the West... ...are all alike That is: Invite a ghost to spell out his messages Gees... it's moving... You moron! That's not funny! - God... it's here! - Stop shuffling! Reak... chan... ma... tum... mai... - Why are you calling me? - Ah! Hey! Mom! Why are you still up? You're scaring my friends! Serves you right! You guys are killing my ears! It's late already! Go to bed now! Okay, after you Sorry guys My mom did some heavy channeling last night She needs to rest... we'd better be quiet So your mom is a spiritual medium?! No wonder she looks kind of weird Late Dinner Alert Thai people believe that... ...crossroads emit a lot of negative power They are the favorite hangouts for stray spirits To catch a glimpse of them Go to an intersection after midnight with... ...a meal for 3, bowls and chopsticks Our target... ...the hungry ghosts Tap the bowl with chopsticks and... ...hungry ghosts will come for the food Is it really going to work? Of course! Believe me, sure thing! When you see them, don't scream, huh! Look who's talking! Just don't flee before me! Once you start tapping the bowl, do not stop! If you stop, the ghosts will see you You don't want to risk being possessed, okay? Let's roll! What is it? What's the matter? Stay cool, keep on tapping What did you see? What is it?! What's going on?! What did you see? I didn't see a thing! - What is it? - Did you see that? Stay cool...! Keep tapping! What?! - What's wrong? - What did you see? - What did you see? - What now? ...I see "them"! Keep tapping! Stay cool! Tap! What's wrong?! Tap! I see nothing! Hey! I didn't get to see anything! What is it that you see, Gofei? - Over there! - But there's nothing there! It's not fair! Everybody got to see it except me! Told you we all have different reception of ghosts Maybe you're just the type who can't see them! Chongkwai, are there any other ways? Don't you guys chicken out now! I've got to see ghosts tonight! HIDE N' SEEK Play Hide n' Seek at midnight carrying a black cat Ghosts will come join us and... ...block one of us from our view We then let go of the black cat The cat can make the ghost appear before us So, not only will we find that missing person We can also... see the ghost! I quit! Come back out! I quit! Papa! What's this stinky water? Papa... Where is he? What now? I think a ghost is blocking Kofei It's okay, it's okay... I'm letting the cat go now Ebony, lead the way! Kofei! Kofei! - Kofei! - Over there! Ebony... seems... dead! Even the cat is dead? What do we do now?! What happened to Kofei?! What do we do?! Where the hell is he?! - Kofei! - Kofei! Kofei, we quit the game! Come back out! Kofei, call it off! - Kofei! - Kofei! Kofei! Kofei! Hello? Kofei! Kofei!? Hello? April, you okay? The phone didn't even ring! No, it did ring! Don' worry too much! The police will follow We will find Kofei for sure! It's all you fault You'd better go back to Hong Kong first The police might not be able to help this time - But auntie... - Just listen to me Leave while you still can Someone could be setting you up I don't think you can defend yourselves! THE EYE MASK April! Don't! April! April, are you okay? April! Close your eyes, don't open them, not now! Close them tight... listen to me! You'll be in trouble if you open them now! We're here for you! You'll be okay! Hold on for just one more sec Okay, now you can open your eyes - Hey, April! - April, 'you all right? It hurts! It was so scary! My eyes, they fell out! No way Your eyes are still there Don't worry, everything's okay now! You guys were only lucky to save her in time! She almost slipped into the limbo world! If she did, she'd be trapped forever! Chongkwai! You should know better not to play with fire! You're not a child anymore! What did auntie say? Does she know where Kofei is? My mom blamed me for teaching you... ...the usage of graveyard soil I nearly caused you trapped in the limbo world I'm so sorry I never thought things would turn out like this! There're too many things that you don't notice There are other dimensions in this world! Do you understand? Apart from our human world... ...there are numerous unknown dimensions April was lucky not to slip into the limbo world When I was a kid, I saw this young woman She entered the limbo world by mistake Let me out! Let me out! Now you know! Always stay away from black magic When things get out of hand... ...you won't be able to survive the consequences But where is Kofei now? Who knows? Just don't stay here! Go back to Hong Kong now! No, I won't! I won't leave without Kofei! Cous Wouldn't it be kind of low if we leave? If we leave, yes, it is low Then we shouldn't do this! But then... ...the cab is here already Low or not low... we can discuss that on the way! Scumbags! How could they ditch April like this?! You call them your friends?! I didn't talk to Ted after we're back to Hong Kong He didn't call me either Maybe he just wants to forget about what happened Me too But I know it's not possible For the first two weeks, Chongkwai did call I didn't dare ask him about April though I wonder how she is now... I pretend everything's normal... I go to school I play, I eat, I went out Damn right, everything is normal So what am I pretending? Mister! Anyone in? "The Ten Encounters"... A GLASS OF SPIRIT That man has gotta have something to do with Kofei! He even drew the 5 of us playing the damn game! Bonehead! It's obvious that he's cast a spell on all of you! You guys just can't overcome this on your own! Midnite comb THE FORBIDDEN shade What's wrong with you?! It's only a ball! Peek-a-stoop It's disturbing! Just answer it! Maybe it's urgent! Okay! Teddy? This time I really saw it! You saw ghosts again? Where is it this time? Right outside my front door! Have a drink and you won't remember it Don't play dumb anymore-it's no use! There is really a ghost playing ball right outside! Just come over now! Are... are you sure? 100 percents! I did the Peek-a-stoop bending over and I saw "him"! I am so very sure! Then... I... then... Cut the crap and come over now! Okay, I will Well, I must go... Where' you going? May? It's Chongkwai! April has vanished! What? Already 2 people among us have disappeared My mom wants you guys to be careful! Why is it still so crowded so late at night? Unit 12C Mister, have you seen my report card? You little damn thing! Sorry I thought you were a ghost! Don't cry... I'm sorry! So what if there are ghosts? Messing with us? What' you doing?! Where am I?! It's dangerous here Teddy...! Thank god you're here! Don't cry... come sit down first We are dead meat I see ghosts all the time! Our problem has not ended just there in Thailand Remember what Chongkwai said? Once we've started the game We just can't quit playing until it's all over! Looks like we must return to Thailand... ...before we can settle everything Ai? Where's that girl? What are you looking for? My Friend, the girl who came in with me! The one from Thailand! We share the same ride together, remember? It's okay now! Come out! I think... I only saw you... ...coming in alone! Why are you watching these tapes? Don't tell me... ...she's here! But... I can't see her now! Wanna try and look between your legs? But how? BEND- O- - VER We shouldn't be doing this! Too risky! Our lives are at stake anyway! This method could be our last resort! Cousin Let's think it over! You're not in this with me, right? Suit yourself! Wait! That's not what I mean I'm in The last frontier Death To advance your death You have to play dead wearing a used funeral suit... ...and then you can infiltrate the limbo world Your time there is limited and you must leave on time Once you hear me ringing a bell... ...enter the stream of white light right away! It's your only way out; don't stall Or you'd never come back! Darn... I still can't fall asleep What a drag... Well then... ...let me help you! - Where are we? - Don't know Darn... - I'm kind of scared - I... ...I'm scared too! Wait! A ghost! But he is smiling! That's right! Chongkwai said... If we don't meddle with them, they won't bother us! This one is kind of cute! Hey, they seem quite friendly too! There There Up there! Something's not right! It's getting crowded here! And they aren't smiling; not so friendly either Quick, think of something! Cannot! Has Chongkwai ever said that... ...ghosts are afraid of the verve in our breath? He said that? Well... Gee, it works! Man, you stink! Get up! Let's go! They've stopped hunting us How' you doing, Ted? I need to rest! So do I Be careful, cousin! You found me, how boring! I quit! Kofei! Thank god you're alright! We've finally found you! Calm down, girl! You didn't see me for only an hour! Where were you guys? - Listen! You were gone for a month! - A month?! We messed up! A ghost has blocked you from our view all these while We play dead to come here for you in the limbo world Huh? This is... This is the limbo world? Yes! It's all over! I'm darn pooped Same here Kofei, you're new here Greet them with your breath! My breath? Yes! What... do you mean? They're afraid of it But how? I really can't do this anymore! I'm breathless!

How come I don't hear or see any of these? How did you come here? Kofei I thought you were dead That's why I... Mom! We're running out of time! Do something! Cous, what do we do now?
