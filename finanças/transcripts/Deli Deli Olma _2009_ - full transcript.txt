At the end of the Ottoman-Russian War the Russians captured Kars. The Tsar drove the Molokans out of Russia... ...and forcibly settled them in Kars. PIANO GIRL Quick! He's coming! I told you they were there. I'll tear off that head of yours! Look at you, miserable dog! The Molokan's cousin just died. That's where they went! God damn him! Where have you been, you little wretch? I was at what's-her-name's! Aunt Najya's. - She was knitting. I went there. - Right! We were helping her. Knitting, was she? And what were you up to? Pansy boy! As if I don't know where you were! If the Molokan catches you, he'll ram a tree up your backsides! Now get moving! Alma, we should get a move on. Your dad and gran will be starving. Check the oven's not burning, will you? Off you go. OK, mum. Come on, Alma! Alma! Hurry up! ?emistan! ?emistan, lose your voice, will you? You're doing my head in! Too bad! Now Abram's gone as well. He's all on his own. God damn him! Gran, why don't you like the Molokan? What has he done to you? Of course I don't like him. They came and took away our land like it was their own. I wanted nothing to do with them. Figan! Figan! Bring me a needle! A needle! Quick! Come on! - Bring it here. - Here you are. Give it here. Listen to that. He sings so sweetly without letting that needle jab him. Oh God! God forbid! You'd have come down with tetanus. Good thing you let me know. Fine, but Ad?be? Amca, your needle's rustier than dad's. So who's going to pay me? Ow! That hurt. It really stings! Ow! Don't look, girl! Is that all? To hell with you! Goddamn you! Get going! He was Russian. A neighbour for years. We should go. I say we should go too. He's on his own now. He hasn't got anyone except us. Well said. And he ground all that flour for us. Then let's get him a bag of sugar and go and offer our condolences. Right. We should go! Well, well! Popu? Hala, I don't remember seeing you here before. May you have nothing but trouble! Pay your debt for the tea! Now! Shame on you! You think I'd get out of it? Pay that debt! Or I'll bring these walls down on you! I hear you bought apples from the Molokan the other day, Allahyar Efendi. Our apples give you gut rot, do they? Is that why you got them from him? Popu? Bac?, are we still growing apples? There isn't an apple tree in the village! If we don't grow them, we will do now! Is it so hard? Don't tell me that scum's the only person who knows how to... ...grow apples! Here you are, Hala. You're not to go offering condolences or I'll bring village down on you! - No, of course not! - Why would we do that? Do you accept visitors? Of course! Please, come in. Go on, Allahyar. In you go. Come on in. Don't talk about sad things. We mustn't upset him. Being alone is so hard. You're dying, you want water and there's no one to help. What are you talking about? We'd be there to help! - We're neighbours, aren't we? - Exactly! Sure, but it's not the same as family. Allahyar, why don't you shut up? Whoa! Who knitted that? I did. I've made some Russian pastries. Will you have some? - He's a raving pansy! - What about the knitting?! - And look, he makes pastries! - He makes pastries himself? Sure, he does! Or you can spit in my face! But I don't have any tea. - No problem! - What does that matter? He has to be a pansy! Hey, Mishka Emmi! Welcome! What can I get for you? I wanted some tea. - And a little flour. - Of course! Here you go. And here's the tea. The only thing is... Shame on you, Mishka Emmi! Who's asking you for money? - We're neighbours, aren't we? Here you go. - Thanks. Take care now. Too bad! To think he was once the miller and look at old Mishka now... May God keep everyone from hard times! - I've forgotten the rest, teacher. - OK, sit down. Thank you. Thanks. Your turn, Alma. We worked on it a bit last week. Play what you can, then I'll help you out. Ok. Did someone have you practise? No. Remember you taught me last week? Well done! Well done! You played it perfectly. Go back to your seat now. OK, children. Today's lesson is about Beethoven's song 'All Men Shall Be Brothers'. - Have any of you heard of Beethoven? - I have! He's the imam from the next village. You've got mixed up again, Tav?an. Now sit down. Children, Beethoven's a famous composer. In other words, a musician. His life was full of hardship. - He was deaf too! - Who was deaf? Beethoven was! The teacher said he was deaf, right? He couldn't hear. That's terrible! Fuck! What do I care about Beethoven? I'm more worried about what's for dinner. Bring your granddad over to our place. I'd love to. Then I'd watch TV too. But he'd never come. He's so pig-headed. Ok, he's pig-headed, but if it wasn't for him... ...I'd be in the shit. Did your mum and dad die when you were a baby? They went off to a wedding in the mountains. The car flipped over. They tumbled out and that was the end of them. People say there's a cart load of apples outside the Molokan's house. Let's go and grab a couple. Sure! Then your gran will hear and tear our heads off! I just don't get it. They're Russian, but so what? - They're no different from us. - Where did you hear that? I swear they're no different. They fartjust like us. - Don't talk rubbish! - What are you doing? I told you. I'm going to get some apples. If the Molokan catches us he'll throw us in the oven. For goodness sake, come here! He'll show up any minute. No, he won't. He went off this morning. I saw him. Are you coming? No! Call me a coward if you like. I don't care. I'm Popu?'s granddaughter. Keep still now. That'll stop it hurting. Help yourselves! The Molokan gave them to me. I promise he did. Goddamn apples! You're not to go to that infidel's garden ever again! - Don't throw them away! - Quiet! Or I'll throw you in too! What a waste! We could have made compote and asked Metin the teacher over. Are you playing knucklebones? Go right ahead. - Shall I do a rabbit for you? - Go on then. Here... This is one ear. And here... - This is the other. - Hey! You ate all my bread! Why are you mad at me? - Tav?an! Come here, little wretch! - I didn't do anything, honest! Come with me. We've got work to do. Get moving! Come on, move! - There! It's as good as new now. - Thanks. I play the piano too. But the one I play is smaller than this. The thing you play is called a keyboard. This is a proper piano. My father's piano. My father loved the piano. He played with his backside. He taught me a few things too. Teach me so I can play too. I'm a fast learner, really! Quiet, girl! If your gran heard, she'd kill us both with a blunt knife! Just kill us? She'd tear me to shreds and throw me in the oven! Why doesn't gran like you? We're from different countries. I expect that's why. Is this your family? The blonde girl's my sister. But they're all dead now. Only Dimitri is left. - Where's he? - In Russia. Does he ever call you? He hasn't, no... He will. I expect he's busy. All he has left is an uncle. Look, I had that phone put in for him. He'll call. If not today, then tomorrow. He'll call on the holiday. It's no time till the holiday. But that's your holiday. Our holiday is when the flowers come out. Well, it's not long till then either. People say you Molokans have lots of gold. That you brought it with you from Russia. If I had money, you think I'd have sunk to this? Mirza Emmi... 20 lira. And he said Mirza owed nothing! Read on or I'll break your neck like a goose! Ad?be?... Seven lira. So that damn needle man owes us too! If I pay him for another injection, they can call me Popu? the whore! Read on! Go on, read! I'll break that neck of yours! - The Molokan... 45 lira. - Read it right! The Molokan... 45 lira. He's given that infidel credit too! ?emistan! God damn you, ?emistan! ?emistan! You little dog! Where are you? That's mum's voice. My window! - Popu? Hala, why did you break my window? - Fuck off! What's wrong, mum? Why are you yelling like there's an iron bar in your throat? You've given credit to the Molokan! - Sure I have. - How could you?! Don't you know I have nothing to do with him? Don't you know if I get my hands on him... ...I'll drown him in the milk churn? You're to go and demand that money at once! Or I'll go. And have words with him! - She would too! - She'll go. Mum! Mum! Molokan... Molokan! - What's up? Why are you shouting? - May your guts rot! Seeing as you parade around like son of a one-time pasha... ...and turn up your nose at us... ...why don't you pay your debts at the shop? You owe the shop 45 lira! Mum! That's shameful! We're neighbours, aren't we? - We've lived side by side for years. - Look, Popu? Bacy. Didn't he grind all that flour for us and never wanted a penny for it? Is it right to do this now the mill's gone... ...and he's fallen on hard times? Go to hell! Come and pay that debt at once! Or blood will spill! I'll get the gendarmerie onto you! Do you hear me? Alma... Off you go now. If your gran finds out, she'll kill you. - She wouldn't do a thing. - Listen to me, my girl. Where have you been, Tav?an? Granddad was sick. I was stuck at home. I hope he's better now. - Have you sold a lot? - No, not yet. I'll sell them in five minutes and get the money. - How much are the apples? - Two liras. What's two liras, Emmi? - Here, you want two kilos? - Hang on. Let's try them first. Go on, give us one then. They're all shrivelled. You call these apples?! Let's go. Shrivelled like your ass! Don't worry. I'll sell the lot by evening. Abi! I've got some great apples. Don't you want any? At least try one! Abi! Popu?! Popu?! Popu?! What's that infidel doing here? I can't pay off my debt to you. I don't have the money. But I've brought an heirloom from my father. It's a very valuable piano. You can take it to town and sell it. What are you talking about? What are we supposed to do with that? Stick it up our backsides? Gran, it's a piano. Beethoven worked as a servant for ages just to buy a piano. You know that? Who's Meethoven? What do I care anyway? Take that evil thing away! It's OK, Mishka Emmi. I'll take it away and sell it. Look, mum. Really we should know the value of things like this. Look what Mithoven put himself through for one of these. Who's Mithoven? Look at the blessed thing! It's as heavy as an infidel's corpse! Of course we can make use of it. Stop that, Alma! Mum, what are you doing? Mum! Stop it, for goodness sake! Mum, please! Mum! - Whoa! Welcome, teacher! - Thanks, ?emistan. Come in, come in. Go on. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Please, have a seat. - Thanks. - Welcome. How are you? - Fine, thanks. And you? We're fine. There's some homemade ravioli. Would you like some? No, thanks. I'm not hungry. But please, you go ahead. How are you, Popu? Teyze? Ailing. I'm so sick I can hardly breathe. I'm at death's door. But you're still young, Teyze. Don't say that. God forbid! - So what's up? - I hear Mishka gave you his piano. It's a very valuable instrument. - I expect you know that, don't you? - Yes, of course. ?emistan Abi, if you ask me, you should keep it. Don't sell it. Alma has a very good ear for music. It could help her later on. By the way, where is the piano? Oh, no! How can you keep the bedding on something so valuable? Come on, girl. Take it off! There, it's off now. You can relax. Dear guests... ...I say we do a 'lips-not-touching' session tonight! What do you say? - Who are you looking out for? - The Molokan. Maybe he'll come. I know he won't. Your gran gave him hell. How could he come? Ow! What have you done? If it weren't for me, you'd all be sick as dogs. Fuck off! What about paying me? And you're asking for money? You owe a fortune at the shop and you're asking for money?! Eat shit! Get out of here! What are you laughing at? At you making an ass of yourself. Leave this business to the experts, ?emistan. Go and sit in your shop. Sell your tea and sugar. Just wait till next time. - You'll be coming next time too? - Yes. And I'll do the 'lips-not-touching' song better than all of you. You'll bet on it? Sure. - The loser pays 100 liras. - OK. Hey, Meheddin Abi! Where are you going? We need tea and sugar! Pay off your debt first. Fuck you! - What debt is he talking about? - Um, well... - Don't you pay him every time? - Sure, but I, you know... - What did you do with the money? - Nothing, I promise! You went and spent it gambling! You little dog! Alma! Stop playing that evil thing or I'll smash it to bits! Anyone who smells this will come running! Let's enjoy it! Eat poison! You think I'll give you goose when you've gambled away the shop money? Hey, mum. You'll make my head explode. Explode for all I care! Come on, mum. Can't we just enjoy it? Give me the bones then. Stop this in front of the kids! Look, she's shouting! Quiet! Thank your mother for me. Mum said, "Don't give it to anyone else. Take it to Mishka Emmi." I haven't had goose for ages. We used to have a couple of geese. But then they all died. Well, there was no one to look after them. And we had no more chicks. Come on. You have some too. I've eaten so much I'll burst. Whatever you say. Alma... Look after that piano. It's an heirloom from my father. Don't let your gran do anything to it. Don't you worry. I'll take great care of it. Good for you. Alma! You were supposed to clean out the cows. What are you doing? - OK, I will. - Go on then. What's this 'paiano' or whatever. I can't even say the word. Evil thing! Alma, stop fooling around. Get back into bed fast! I'll throw that evil thing in the oven, believe me! Come on, sweetie. One last time. One, two, three... Press that one too. - ?emistan! - What? Quick! It's almost noon. Get to that shop! You'll make your mum crazy! Just a minute! Come on, sweetie. Come on, girl! Press away! ?emistan... And here she is. I had to live to see this, huh? Goddamn that miano, ziano or whatever! Enough of that evil thing! I know exactly what I'm going to do! Mum! Mum! Meheddin! Meheddin, where are you, you dog? Please, gran! Don't give it away! Clear off! Or I'll drown you like a chick, believe me! What are you shouting about? - We owe you, don't we? - Aha. Here, we've paid off the debt. - What's that? - It's from the Molokan. "Sell it in town," he said. "You'll get good money for it." Go away! Give me the money! The money! What am I supposed to do with that? I don't know. Do what you like. We don't have the money. Go on! Get the thing down, you dogs! She's crazy, you know. Take the thing or she'll bring your house down! Is it too strong, gran? More water? No. That's fine. - She's in a good mood. - Aha. Look at the old witch singing away. Quiet, girl! Go and answer the door. It'll be your dad. - How are you, Selver? - What's it to you? Welcome, Alma! Come and sit down. What's up? I was at Zeycan Nene's weaving carpets. I got so thirsty on the way back I thought I'd... ...stop by for some water. Good for you. Go on! Help yourself to some homemade ravioli. I know what you're looking for. It's not in the house. Here, it's in here. - Don't kick it! - I'll kick it if I want. It's my piano, isn't it? I'll do what I want with it. But it belonged to the Molokan's father! What are you talking about? If you bash it, I'll bash you back! Fuck off! It's ours! We'll do what we want with it. I'll piss on it if I like! - Hey, Figan! - What? - When's Tav?an coming over? - I don't know. Welcome! - Hey! Welcome. - Thank you. Welcome, Amca. Tav?an, how are you, sweetie? Help yourself, Amca. - Alma, what's with the face? - Selver's been kicking the piano. - Son of a bitch! - What can we do to stop him? - Oh no, mum! - What's wrong? The window's been smashed. A thief's been into the shop! He didn't take anything. Only sweets. What can I say? I hope they stick in his throat! Hey! He's choking! Are they all for me? - If you don't kick the piano. - OK, OK. I won't. Snotty-nose! What's the matter, Mishka Emmi? Oh God! Should I give you an injection? Get up and I'll take you inside. Come on. Lean on me. Ad?be? said you were sick. Bless him. He's making a mountain out of a molehill. I only had a small nosebleed. I'm fine. Why are you lying down then? Well, old men lie down. And I'm an old man now. - Shall I make you some soup? - No, thanks. I have no appetite. How are you, Mishka Emmi? I heard you're sick. I'm just fine. Don't make a fuss. Alma, I've got something to tell you. It's Dimitri! That's his nephew. He's calling from Russia. Hello, Dimitri? No, this isn't Nazl? Han?m's place. No problem. - What were you going to say? - Selver's been kicking the piano. Didn't I tell you Snotty-Nose would go back on his word? I hid here and watched him for two hours. He kicked the piano maybe 100 times. He really kicked it then. Come on, let's take a look. And we gave him all those sweets! You rat! You promised not to kick it! Piss off or I'll call my dad! Go ahead. Call the whole village! Fuck your mother! I told you to go away! How can you say that about his dead mother! You rat! Come on, Meheddin. Don't be daft! They're only kids. They play, they fight. No way! I'm making a complaint! Take these two away, officer! They almost broke my son's nose. Wait till I break your skull. Then you'll see what breaking means! These kids are still young. There's nothing we can do. Let's go. What do you mean? I told you, I want to make a complaint! I'll show you! Now look here! I don't believe it! They've gone! Hey, Meheddin Emmi. I know it's not the time for this. But I'm really out of money. Can you lend me some? Hold on and I will. Stop! Stop! Come on down, sweetie. I don't believe it! You've given us that evil thing! Damn the piano! G?ldene will kill me! Ooph! It's giving me palpitations! Stop gabbling, Fezo. You're making me crazy! Hey, Fezo! What's that? I can't do the housework if you bring all these people back. They don't call her 'grumpy G?ldene' for nothing! I said, what's that?! Meheddin didn't pay off his debt. He gave us this instead. I'll take it to town and sell it. They say it's worth a fortune. Damn that Meheddin! He's fooling you. Come on, Fezo. Let's unload the thing. Don't take it indoors. It's got moths. Don't worry. It's cleaner than you! The Molokan dusted it every day. Stop yapping or I'll tear your hair out! G?ldene Abla, take good care of it. It's very valuable. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. That's up to me. Fezo, we'll have words tonight! Now listen. Come to the shop when we're done here. You and I have work to do. - What work? - Don't shout! - We'll talk about it in the shop. - OK. You little punk, Tav?an! Where have you been? It took me this long, ?emistan Emmi. Come here. - What happened? - I found out. I crept in while they were playing cards and watching TV. And I listened. Allahyar Emmi told the tea man he'd name... ...the rhyme words on minstrels' night... ...and for the 'lips-not-touching' songs... ...he'd give the rhyme word 'mother'. - You star! Tonight, I'm going to win that 'lips-not-touching' session! I wish mum would come and I could go home and practise! What are you hanging around for? You imp! Here. Now off with you! Shovel it properly. Believe me, I wouldn't think twice... ...about burning that thing in the barn. - I'm great at shovelling. - Good for you. Go on! Fill those shovels! Throw it the other way. That's it! Stupid bag! Look, no talking! Get to work! Kick it with your heel. Kick with your heel. Your heel! - Or else... - You'll burn the piano. Too right! The Molokan! Alma! Welcome, Mishka Emmi! A tea for Mishka Emmi! Let him drink poison! I'm going to sing a 'lips-not-touching' number. Just see how I sing without jabbing myself. Sing with your heart and you will. Why not? But if you start showing off... ...you'll jab yourself and forget your words. Careful now! Now tonight, I say we do another 'lips-not-touching' session. And we'll see who turns up. ?emistan, think carefully. Don't go doing what you did last time! Hey, come on! Let's get started. Isn't Allahyar Emmi here? Allahyar Emmi went to his daughter's. He didn't make it because of the snow. Abi, how could he go?! What are you talking about? Well, he just went, didn't he? I'm in the shit then. Let's have Mishka name the rhyme word! Yes, let's! He should do it! What do you say, Mishka? What should the rhyme word be? The rhyme word should be 'beautiful'! ?emo! OK, I lost the bet. But I swear on the lives of my children I don't have a penny. Come and get that piano back. That's my girl! Get out of here! What's going on? Ah! Here it is. What's going on?! You owe us. So we're taking the piano away. Wait! Hold on! You'll scare the chickens out of laying! Give that here. It was a mistake anyway putting it on that evil thing. God knows best! Grab it, Fezo. Don't say you've brought that evil thing back! You Molokan... It's all your fault! Hello? Who's that? Don't shout. I can't hear! Hey, Uncle Behri! How are you? Really? I hope she gets well soon. I'll tell mum. She'll come over. I kiss your hands! What's up, ?emistan? What did he say? Aunt Bally's sick. She asked for mum. She wants to see her before she dies. Mum, Ginyaz will come and get you. Get yourself ready. Well, thanks, Bally! You're putting me out on a winter's day. - She's sick, mum. - So am I. Ginyaz! Take this. OK then. Have a good trip, mum. As if you'll be thinking of me! Now look! Get rid of that evil thing before... ...I'm back or there'll be trouble! Let's go, Popu? Ana. Before it's evening. Wait, you little dog! Why on earth am I going? But mum, your niece is dying. She asked for you. You have to go. If she dies, she dies. We all die some time. - Don't neglect that shop! - OK, OK. We won't. Off you go, Ginyaz. Travel safely! Hey, Figan! How about some homemade ravioli in memory of your granddad? I've been craving it for ages! Really, mum. Will you make some? Go on! Hey, Molokan! I've got you some homemade ravioli. What's wrong? Why are you in bed? Don't make a fuss. I had a bit of a backache so I lay down. Here, I'm up now. Molokan! - ?emistan! - Yes? Thanks. I could have stayed at home. But get better and you will. Anyway, our home is yours. We're hardly strangers. Don't worry. Gran's away. She's gone to her cousin's. There you are. - Let's slip this under your back. - Thanks. There, that's great. What's up, girl? Look, are you crazy? How could you bring the Molokan here? I swear, Figan, I went to his house. He was lying there half-dead. He's sick. He's really sick. - Thanks. - That's OK. It's worked out great. I have a heart too. But you know your mum. If she comes back and sees this... ...she'll bring the house down on us. Don't worry about that. I dropped by at the shop. My aunt said it was snowing a lot... ...and mum wouldn't be back for 10 days. She said not to worry. So mum's away for another 10 days. Why didn't you say so? I was going out of my mind! So your mum's away for another 10 days, huh? Yes. Quiet, girl! Molokan... - Is your back aching again? - No. I can't sleep. Go back to bed now. Wait. Let me fix that pillow. Then maybe you'll get to sleep. OK. Thanks. - Molokan? - Yes? Have you ever been in love? Yes, of course I have. Who hasn't? - Was she Russian? - Aha. What was her name? Come on. Back to bed or you'll be... ...late for school in the morning. Go on, what was it? - Senta... - Senta? Senta. Did you love her a lot? Yes, a lot. Did you love her enough to give her your goose meat? Tav?an says if he gives a girl his goose meat... ...then he really loves her. Come on now. Back to bed. You need your sleep. Hey, Alma! What, mum? Leave him alone and let him sleep. OK, mum. I'm back in bed now. You're pressing those keys too hard. Look, use your hands like a swan gliding through water... ...like a bird flying through the air... ...like a horse galloping across the plains. My father taught me a song. You want me to teach you? Ok. In other words... If only I'd been a creeper... If only I'd had had somewhere to cling to... If only I hadn't been uprooted... If only my roots had reached deeper... If only I'd been a creeper... If only I'd wound myself round and round... And held fast to the same spot for days and days... So I grew numb from not moving... But I'm just a couch grass... A common weed... A weed pulled up wherever it grows... A weed longing to be a creeper... I'm a couch grass... A weed without roots, a weed unloved... A weed trying to be a creeper... There, a weed like that. That's Popu? Hala coming, isn't it? Oh right, sure! You must take me for an idiot. You're always trying to fool me. No, really! She's coming. If you don't believe me, come and look. - Why is she back? It is mum! - Exactly. Why is she back? She only just left. She'll go straight home. - Too right she will. - But she can't! The Molokan's there! Mum! Hey, stop! Mum! Look what you've done behind my back! You've brought the Molokan home! He's sick. That's why, is it? Well, God willing he'll die soon! Then I'll fast for a month. Mum, what are you doing? I'll rip out that stomach of yours! He can fuck off! Let him die wherever, but not in my house! Wait! Come here, boy! Gran, please don't! Get away! Or I'll squash you like a cockroach! Mum! Mum, what are you doing? Mum, don't for goodness sake! Go to hell! Move it, Ginyaz! Mum's out of her mind again! Move! Take this too! To hell with your miano! And to hell with you! Oh, teacher! Where have you been? I'm just back from Kars, ?emistan Abi. I spent a few days there. - Everything Ok? - Oh yes! More than Ok. Come over here. If you're not busy tonight, I'd like to come... ...and discuss the matter with you. Of course. No need to even ask. - OK. See you this evening. - See you. Bye! - Figan! - What's going on? Metin the teacher is coming over... ...to ask for Esme's hand tonight! - Really? - Yes! He's been to Kars to buy engagement presents! Well, he didn't say that. But it's what I'm guessing. He said he wanted to come over tonight and talk about something. Let me go and ask Allahyar Emmi over! He should give the girl away. He's our elder. It's down to him. Then I should make some more. This won't do for all of us. Thank you. It's delicious. I... I've come here to... ...ask your permission for something. Oh, you have it. You have it. I don't understand. - You have our permission. - You have it. So you know all about it then. I didn't tell anyone but... Since you already know... ...then I can take Alma to the exam... ...with absolute peace of mind. - What exam? - What on earth is he talking about? The conservatoire exam. Alma has a great talent for music. Especially the piano. I want to take her to Kars so she can do the piano exam. That's why I went to Kars. She can get a scholarship. Just hold on, teacher! Who are you taking there? Popu? Hala, Alma's very talented. You must have realized that too. Even without any training, she has... ...a great ear for music and sense of rhythm. I'm convinced she'll be a great pianist in years to come. I came to get your approval for this, that's all. That miano or whatever, that box of poison... ...is back to plague us again. You see? No, I won't allow it! She's not going anywhere! She's to stay in the village and milk the cows! Gran's been sick for days because I'm going to Kars. Maybe she's faking it. She's such a witch. Don't say that. These are done. What do we do now? Take them out and soak them in oil. Goodness me, lovely Alma... So you're going to be a pianist, huh? We'll see. They're done now. - Happy Easter! - Thanks. Here we go then. I won! Give it here. It's a holiday, but I haven't kissed your hand! But there's no hand-kissing with us. There is with us. Young people kiss their elders' hands. Especially their grandfathers'. That's Dimitri! It's Easter, right? Don't speak to him. You sound too sick. He'll get worried. I'll answer. Hello? Hello? Don't speak Russian! I don't understand. I'm Alma, Mishka's neighbour's daughter. Speak Turkish. Miska says, "How are you? Are you well?" Fine, thanks. Mishka? He's well. Everything's fine with him. Oh, really? The place where he works sent him miles away. He says there's no phone there. That's why he can't call. - So will Alma play the bagpipes? - Yes, if mum allows her. So the village will have an actress? It's not called an actress, Ad?be?. It's called an a musician. Will our girl be singing then? No, not singing. Playing the piano. Well, whatever. It's good. There's no harm in it. Come on, Allahyar Emmi! Let her play. What harm does it do us? She should go! You want her to go and become a whore?! Ah! Shame on you! Popu? Bacy, is everyone at school in the city a whore then? Fuck you! Popu? Teyze, you're making a big mistake. Alma's not doing anything bad. Anyway, we're going to Kars whether you allow it or not. If you go, I swear I'll jump in the river and drown! She's lying. She's nice at heart. - You little dog! - Ow! Your shit ideas stink! Don't be so stupid! If you go, I swear I'll stab myself! I'll throw myself off the roof! How did it go? Was it OK? - Elma Sar?ya??z. - Here, she's coming. May God give you a clear mind! Go on, sweetie. Bye for now. Alma! Look, just remember this, Ok? You're no different from those other children. In fact, you're more talented than most of them. Remember that, OK? - Off you go now. Good luck. - Go on, sweetie. Come on in, Elma. Welcome! What an interesting name you have. I don't understand why anyone would call their child 'apple'! Did you come from E?meyaz? Village? Aha. - What's your village famous for? - Umm, its people. Its people? How do you mean? The people there are very chummy. What did she say? I don't understand. She means the people are very friendly. Ok, thank you, Elma. Can you play the piano a little? I can play a few things. I learned a couple by myself and one of them Mishka taught me. Who's Mishka? My grandfather. But Mishka's a Russian name. I guess he's not your real grandfather. No. But in my heart he is. Ok, well let's hear that song he taught you then. If only I'd been a creeper... If only I'd had had somewhere to cling to... If only I hadn't been uprooted... If only my roots had reached deeper... Hello? I can hear voices. Hello? Hello? I can't hear. She passed! Lovely girl! Get lost! Demons! Infidels! Scum! They forgot to hang up. That's my girl! I knew you'd pass anyway. - Hello there! - Hello. Where have you been, Ad?be?? I was out of medication. I went to the clinic to stock up. People in the village keep getting sick. They'd all be lost without me. Yes, definitely! What would become of us without you? God rest your father's soul. You say that, but it's not doing the villagers any good. Mishka Emmi's sick and in hospital now. So what good am I? - The Molokan's sick? - Aha. - What's wrong with him? - I don't know. Poor man. - Dad, let's visit him in hospital. - Ok, sweetie. We'll go. It's lung cancer. The doctors cut him open and sewed him straight up again. "There's nothing we can do," they said. So I don't know if he'll make it through this winter. - Does he know? - Of course! He's no fool. He knows he's going to die. Ask your father to come here. Dad, the Molokan wants to talk to you. But only you. Come here, sweetie. Yes, Mishka Emmi? Is there something you want? Alma said she's won a scholarship or whatever it's called to study. Right. The state's paying for her, God willing. But we're still moving to Kars as a family. I make it sound easy but it's going to be tough. Still, God is great! I have some money. I mean good money too. I'm going to give it to Alma. So don't worry about having no money. Impossible, Mishka Emmi! How can we accept that money? Hey, hold on, Mishka Emmi. Where did you find that money? I mean, you couldn't even pay the 45 lira you owed the shop. I found it somewhere, no matter where. Alma... is very dear to me. Who else am I going to give it to? Well, thank you. God feeds the hungry bird, as they say. And he's fed Alma too. You see? Hello there! - How are you, Elven? - Fine thanks. And you? Terrible. I heard about the Molokan. It really upset me. He's one of the village after all. - What's happened? - He has cancer, right? They say he'll be dead in a few days. There's no one to take him soup even. It's too bad! Poor thing. I'll visit him with Ziyeddin tonight. Do. You'll be doing a good deed. Yes, you're right. - Mum, I'm not taking these. - What are you going to wear then? We can get stuff there. People will laugh at me in these. - Go to the next room. - Figan! I called Durmu? He said of course we can stay until we find a house. He should say that. We've done him enough favours. Mum... Come on! She says she's not coming. She's going to stay here on her own. That's crazy! Mum! You can't stay here. Come on! Go to hell! Leave me alone! There. I told you. Is it tomorrow you're leaving? Wear these. They'll keep your feet warm. Thanks. I can't knit any more. That's OK. You'll finish those other socks. I'll be back next year. You'll be better by then. OK. Come at Easter so you can paint the eggs. Of course I will. I should go. Don't be sad. No, I won't. You're fine, thank goodness. We'll see loads more of each other. Alma! I had the mums in the village in tears! I won all knucklebones off the kids. - How many did you win? - About 20 or 30. - This one's broken. - Is it? Yes. Alma, why are you crying? Are you crying because I won the knucklebones? Well, all the best. - Goodbye then. - Bye. Thanks. God damn it. I hear you're very sick. Soup will be good for you. Popu?. You deserve to die hungry and thirsty but... ...still, I'm a decent person. I couldn't bear that. Is that how you keep that? Don't go. Don't go, Popu?. I'm dying. Listen to me... For me, you died that night. I waited for you all night by the Ani ruins. I waited so long. You didn't come. For me, you died that night. I couldn't come. I set off on my way... But I couldn't come, Popu?. Mishka! Where are you going? You're running away with Popu?, aren't you? What will we do if you go? We're just a handful of people here. A handful of people with no friends but each other. A handful of people like starlings taking shelter in the bushes. Please, Mishka! Don't turn the Turks against us. Don't go, Mishka! Don't go! I couldn't come. I couldn't leave my mother and come. You'd have come if you loved me! You'd have left her and come! You didn't love me. You never loved me. I did love you, Popu?. I loved you so much. - Where have you been? - The Molokan's died. What a shame! It's too bad... He had cancer. How should we bury him? Should we wrap him in a shroud? Is it OK to read from the Koran? But they don't read the Koran. There's no graveyard for them either. What do you know about how to bury him? Go to hell, the lot of you! - Go to hell! - Come on, let's go. Infidel! There, you're dead. If only you'd died before... And I'd never set eyes on you. If only I'd never loved you! Infidel! Infidel!
