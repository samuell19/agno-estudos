Is the wine OK? It's fine. What's that? Grace, I want us to start over. I love you. You were with someone else. How do you expect me to trust you again? Gracie. You've got to let me try. I am so sorry. Thanks for walking me to my car. Yeah. This is nice. It is. Can I call you tomorrow? Jason... Just come home. I'm ready to try again. Come here. You'll have to do better than that. First one to the top wins. Oh! Victory! I'm gonna miss this. Mom. What? This is where we used to have your birthday parties when you were little. I've come to love our morning runs here. Hey, we said no tears. I'm only moving 15 minutes away. Just wait until you're a mother, you'll understand. Bright side, you can start running with Dad again. Your father hates to run. He hates to lose. Maybe I should let him win, too. Hey, I won, fair and square. Race you home? Go! Morning, Sam. Liz, Christina, good morning. You just don't think you can run without me. OK. There you are. Hey, sweetheart. You said you'd come running with us. I'm sorry. I just got caught up with the case and all... OK. I just can't keep up with you two. At least stay for breakfast? And before you say no, just remember, I'm moving out. Wait. You finally found a roommate? I'm meeting a few more candidates today, but I might hang some more flyers on campus, just to be safe. Sweetheart, we can cover the other half of the rent until you find somebody. Thank you. But I'm sure it'll work out. Come on. Stay. Mom's making pancakes. Twenty minutes. Thank you, Liz. These were delicious. Yeah, thanks, Mom. You're welcome, sweetie. It's amazing you found time to fill these baking orders. Luckily, Christina helped. What are you gonna do when I move out? You can't do all this by yourself. Well, maybe it's time I hired some help. Dad can help. I guess you didn't tell her. Tell me what? Your dad's up for managing partner. That's fantastic! Will you hire me as summer associate? Oh, my God. I love you. But it's not a done deal. Yet. Which is why I won't have much free time. So I'm sorry I can't help more, Liz. It's OK. Sam offered to pitch in until I find someone. Sam's helping out, huh? He wanted to thank me for baking Stacy's sweet sixteen cake. Oh, which reminds me. Christina, you still haven't told me what you want for your birthday. You know I live for chocolate. But you're keeping this party simple, right? A few friends, finger foods... Small and tasteful. Please be sure that this party's on your calendar. Mom, come on. He'll be here if he can. I have to get to class. Bye, sweetie. Love you guys. Love you, too. Have a good day. Do you have to put me on the spot like that? I just don't want her to be disappointed. Well, Liz, she's a big girl now. And she understands the pressure that I'm under. And I don't? I barely have time to plan her party. That's because you're taking on too much. I thought this baking thing was a hobby. It's not a hobby, Noah. It's my job. And you said you supported it. And I do, Liz, but this promotion is more than just putting in the hours. I've got dinners. I've got functions. I'll need you there. And I can't do both? Morning, Noah. Sam. So, where can I start? Um, can you fold bakery boxes? You got it. You should go, or you're gonna be late. Right. Is everything OK? Yeah. Hey. Hey. You're putting up more flyers? Still looking for that perfect roommate. Babe, I'm here for you. You know I'm a good cook, too. We've only been dating a couple of months, you can't move in. So I'll spend the night, right? I'll think about it. Think about it? Think about this. Don't you have a class? Careful. A lot of weirdos out there. So, my boyfriend was cheating on me with one of my sorority sisters. And there's no way that I'm gonna keep living with that slut in the Kappa Beta Kappa house. Uh, so you're looking for a new place to live? And that's why I like cats more than I like humans. Ah, OK. And you own a lot of cats? Well, I prefer to say I cohabitate. You're not allergic, are you? Hi. Just a second. Sorry. Christina, right? Yeah. I'm Alyssa. It's so nice to meet you. You as well. So, you said on the phone you just moved here? That's right. Needed a fresh start. Bad break-up. He was kind of a jerk, so it wasn't hard getting over him. His loss. So, was it difficult transferring schools? Oh, I'm not a student. I saw your ad at a cafe. Oh, which one? This cafe. It's right next door to the hospital I volunteer at. I love this place. We study here all the time. That's really sweet that you volunteer at the hospital, by the way. I spent a lot of time at hospitals when I was a kid. Oh, were you sick? My dad. Pancreatic cancer. Oh, I'm so sorry. During his treatments, the nurses would take care of me. We'd play poker, eat ice cream, which made everything a little less scary. And now you volunteer. Yeah. I understand what people are going through, and I wanna try to make it easier, if I can. Plus, I'm a pretty good poker shark now. Good to know. Tell me about you. I'm a law student. First year. I wanna fight for the underdog. Like my dad used to do before he had to go into corporate law to pay the bills. Um, so, I do have to ask, just cos we're splitting the rent, you work, right? Oh, yeah. I'm a personal trainer. I work as an office temp. I even walk dogs. I know that doesn't sound very ambitious, but the truth is, I always wanted to get married. Have that perfect family. No judgment. My mom loved being a housewife. And now she runs a bakery business out of her house. That's amazing! Your mom sounds really smart. Thanks. She is. So, the apartment is actually just off campus. Do you wanna walk over and check it out? I'd love to. You're in early. Trying to give me a run for managing partner? Worried? Not really. I signed two new clients before breakfast. Good morning, Patricia. Morning. Thank you very much. Any messages? On your desk. Can you call the florist for me? Oh, boy. What'd you do now? Send roses. Two dozen. That bad, huh? Mr Ellis needs Carson's file. It wasn't on your desk. I've got it right here. I think I found a loophole for the non-competes. A loophole that could win the case? We wouldn't even have to go to trial. Carson's son let it slip. He's adopted. And if I find the right precedent, he could form the company independently. And then Carson can finally kick his partner to the kerb. Bingo. You gonna pitch it to Ellis? Just gonna grab the file. After reviewing it this morning, Christina must have accidentally taken it. Then you better get it. Ellis is due in court in an hour. Come on in. Sorry about the mess. So, there's two bedrooms. You can have the bigger one, if you want. It looks like you've barely moved in. I like your couch. I'm in the process. Tonight's my first night. Let's see. What else can I tell you? There is a laundry facility in the building. And a gym. A gym? Perfect. I could use it for my personal training clients. So you like it? Well, I mean, it could use a little personality. Maybe some art. I have a really big painting that would look great over there and another one right over here. One that would be perfect there. And there, maybe some wallpaper. How do you feel about decorative pillows? Um... Oh. Sorry. We haven't made this official. If you need more time... When can you move in? Thank you! I've been looking for a while. You wouldn't believe how many weirdos are out there. Um, actually I would. Oh, no. Oh. Bad news? Er, yeah. I think I have a file my dad needs. There it is. Damn. His office is downtown, and I have class in 20 minutes. I can take it to him. I have the day free. I can't ask you to do that. I'm offering. You just helped me out in a really big way. Listen. Today's the anniversary of losing my father. And... Oh, I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It happened a long time ago. I was a kid. But when the date comes up, I like to stay busy. It helps, you know. Of course. I mean, thank you. I'll text you the address. Great. Hello. I'm here to see Noah Davis. Your name? Alyssa Winters. His daughter, Christina, sent me. I'm sorry. Christina sent you? Yes. She said her father needed this. Oh, thanks. I'll give it to him. I told Christina I would give it to him, personally. I'm Mr Davis's assistant. Then you can show me to his office. Follow me. Noah, someone to see you. Mr Davis? Can I help you? I'm Alyssa, Christina's new roommate. She said you needed this. Her new roommate? As of 30 minutes ago. Christina had a class, so I offered to bring over the file. Well, thank you. That's very generous. My pleasure. This is a really nice office. You must be the best attorney they have. Second best! Peter Buchanan. And you are? You should stop by for dinner. You and your wife. Once Christina and I get settled. Of course. Well, I'll get out of your hair. It was really nice meeting you. Likewise, um... Alyssa. Right. Thanks again for the files. Who's that? That's Christina's new roommate. And she's inviting you to dinner. Morning, Mr Ellis. Morning. If you're heading to the courthouse, I can give you a ride. Thank you, Peter. Patricia said you wanted to see me. Yes, sir. It's about the Carson case. Peter, why don't you head down and bring the car around? This'll just take a moment. Mm. I think I've found a loophole for the non-competes. Ta-da! Oh, I love that. I promised myself I would never eat Chinese food ever again, but here I am, in my brand-new apartment... Well, you really went all out, didn't you? I promised I wouldn't, but I can't help myself. So, what did you decide? About what? About the bakery. Did you talk to Noah? You said you were ready. We've barely had time to talk about anything. If we're not working, we're wining and dining his clients, so I guess it'll have to wait. Why does it have to wait? I have a friend in commercial real estate. I can get you a list of properties. I couldn't ask you to do that. Liz, you were there for me when my wife died. I couldn't have made it through without you. Please. Let me just return the favour. You already are. I couldn't have made it through the last couple of weeks without your help. Christina will be so pleased. Thought the party wasn't for another hour. Uh, Liz needed some help setting up. So... Sweetie, why don't you go inside and get ready for the party? Can I come in? Sure. You're not dressed for the party. I'm not feeling up to it. Are you OK? I was unpacking, and I found some old photos. Of my ex. I wasn't completely honest when I said I was over him. Did he cheat on you? He cheated on his wife. So he was married. I didn't know. Doctors don't always wear their rings. He was a doctor and you were a volunteer? That doesn't sound fair. When I found out the truth, I finally broke it off. He lost it and filed a harassment claim with HR. Hey, you know what? The best way to get over him is to get back out there. Marcus is bringing his roommate to the party tonight. He is very cute. I don't know. You said you need a fresh start, right? Come on. It'll be fun. OK. Come on. Let's find you a killer dress to wear. Marcus! Hey. Hey, guys. This is my new roommate, Alyssa. How you doing? Marcus Jackson. This is my roommate, Craig Porter. Hey, I know you. I saw you at registration this week. You're a nurse, right? I'm just a volunteer. OK. Well, uh, I'm just a doctor. Oh. Bad joke? Yeah. I mean, you have something against doctors? Not at all. OK. Well, um, how about we get some coffee sometime? I don't think so. Eee, nice. I'm an idiot. Her ex was a doctor, and it did not end well. Just let me talk to her. Nah, it's... Don't worry about it, man. She's new. It's OK. All right. Alyssa, I'm so sorry about that. Hey, birthday girl. Oh, Patricia. Hi. Happy birthday. Oh, honey. Do you know if any of these have peanuts? Oh, right. Your allergy. Give me a minute and I'll check. Thanks. Well, hi, Alyssa. Hi. Christina and I were having a conversation, and you're interrupting. Well, I'm... I'm sorry. No, it's fine. Um, just give us a second. Absolutely. Alyssa... I should have told you Craig was a doctor. I wasn't thinking. Clearly. But he's a great guy. Don't judge him just because... It's too soon. OK. I thought you understood. Can we please just drop it? Leaving? I shouldn't have come. I'm not in the party mood. I know how you feel. What are you drinking? Scotch. You want one? Yeah. Thanks again for bringing that file. It was a big help. So... how's the place coming along? Well, our upstairs neighbour stomps around like Bigfoot. But otherwise, it's good. You planning on taking us up on that dinner invite? Your wife has. Twice. Work's just been hectic. Christina mentioned you're up for managing partner. Yeah. It's between me and another colleague. Tell me it's not that sleazy guy who couldn't stop staring at my ass. Actually, it is. Can you beat him? He likes to play dirty. My advice... don't be like that. I believe if you work hard, you should get what you deserve. Doesn't always work that way. PHONE RINGS Peter? I hear you're having a party. Sorry I wasn't invited. What do you need? Big client got arrested last night. So, Andrew sends his regrets, but he won't make the party. We're working on the brief for the judge right now. I handle the briefs, Peter. I know, but... Andrew is really impressed with my work so far. Tell Christina, "Happy birthday". Damn it. Is everything OK? Yeah, I've just, uh... Just got to head back into the office. Liz is gonna kill me. Enjoy the rest of your night. We knew you wouldn't keep it small but tasteful. Where is your father? I don't know. I saw him earlier. He's right here. Dad, where are you? I'm at the office. A client needed me. It's OK. I understand. You just left? Why didn't you say something? I didn't want to spoil the party. Chrissy, I love you. I'm sorry, and I promise I will make it up to you. Mom, he said he was sorry. He always says he's sorry. Liz. How was that? That was perfect. Thank you, Alyssa. For... For everything. Sam? Where's Liz and Christina? Um, Christina took off with some friends a while ago, and Liz is upstairs taking a nap. Might want to give her some space. OK. You can leave now. I got it from here. Do you? What'd you say? Nothing. Liz. I'm sorry. You always apologise with flowers. Where did you even find them at this hour? You bought them before the party. No, I didn't. Why don't you understand the pressure that I'm under? I asked you for one night, Noah. For our daughter. Christina knows what's at stake. And she believes in me. I believe in you! You believe in Sam. What? You cheer him on with whatever he does. And I show up late for dinner, and you give me hell. That is not true. I have always supported you. Honey, if I have ever made you feel otherwise, I'm sorry. Support goes both ways, Noah. I want to open a bakery. And you will, Liz. But if I don't get this promotion, I'm gonna have to start over. I'd need to open my own firm. Why do I always have to put my life on hold so that you get what you want? Alyssa. Uh... I'm sorry, the back door was open. And I didn't wanna wake anyone up. Is Christina here? She left with Marcus. I was almost home when I realised I was missing an earring. My dad gave me these, and they mean a lot, so... I shouldn't have barged in. I'm sorry. No, no. That's... That's OK. Those are beautiful. Yeah, that's what I was hoping Liz would say. You would have been here if you could. And you told Christina you'd make it up to her, so that's all that matters. How about that dinner? At your place. I'll cook for you and Christina. You cook? On occasion. Tomorrow? Deal. Perfect. Would you, um, give these to Christina for me? Of course. And, um... Here. Ah... No, thank you for trying to help with the party today. I really appreciate that. Good night, Mr Davis. Noah. Noah. What is all this? Surprise. I can't believe you did all this. I'm sorry. I never should have left your party. This more than makes up for it. I'll be right back. Mm. Smells so good. My compliments to the chef. Oh, look. Here. In your hair. Thank you. I'm starving. Well, uh, let's eat. Where's Mom? She had a rush order to fill. Pretty soon she's gonna have to open her own bakery. Dad, she could have ten bakeries, none of it matters if she thinks you don't support her. Fine. What's your advice? All she's ever wanted is to spend more time with you. And you know what she loves doing almost as much as baking? No. Anything but that. My mom has been begging him to go running with her, but he is always finding excuses. What is running gonna fix? It's a romantic gesture. Way better than flowers. OK. Well, I'm not exactly in the best shape, so... All you have to do is rebuild your stamina. Alyssa's a personal trainer. She can help you get back in shape. I don't know. It'll be easy. Two weeks. We'll start early, so it doesn't interfere with work. Come on. For Mom. OK. How hard could it be? Pace yourself. Noah. Yeah. Maybe we should take a break. I'm good. You don't wanna hurt yourself. OK. We're stopping. You weren't kidding when you said you were out of shape. And I thought I was getting faster. We've only been training a couple of days. We'll get there. Well... I need to get faster. Easy, tiger. Running with your wife isn't likely to fix your marriage. But you're a good guy for trying. Maybe Liz is right. She mentioned seeing a therapist. My parents did. Yeah? Did it help? It made things worse. Great. I was relieved when they got a divorce. Ah. I don't want a divorce. I love my wife. My dad loved my mom. He tried so hard, but nothing was ever good enough. She couldn't see how perfect he was. So she left him. Eventually, he found someone else. Someone better. He was finally happy. You deserve to be happy, too. I got a busy day. I should get to the office. Noah, wait. Oh, your lunch is here. I didn't order anything. The delivery guy said it was for you. From who? Something about a promotion? I mean, Patricia, you are always sticking your business cards in these "win a free lunch" bowls. True. But this is Chinese chicken salad. I can't eat this. Here, you take it. I already ate. But it says "no peanuts" on the receipt. Huh. It does. Well, who said there's no such thing as a free lunch? OK. We got everything done. I can't believe it. I think this was your biggest sales day yet. It felt like it. Hey. What if I were to loan you the money? I couldn't ask you to do that. No. I could underwrite the business till you're ready to take it over. That's very kind of you, Sam. Well, I believe in what you're doing. I can tell you have talent. And that shouldn't be stifled. Just think about it, that's all. I will. Great. Hey, Noah. Thank you, Patricia. Are you feeling OK? I don't know. Maybe I'm coming down with something. All right. Why don't you go home? Get some rest. Yeah. Patricia! Somebody get help! Call 911! Hang in there, Patricia. Noah, hold her head. Is she allergic to anything? Peanuts. Does anyone have an EpiPen? I think she has one in her purse. Go get it. Her pulse is racing. Airway is closed. She's going into anaphylactic shock. Hold her head back. I have to try to open up her airway. Patricia? Here you go. Hold on, Patricia. You're gonna be OK. Noah. Noah. Liz. I called the office and heard about Patricia. How is she? She's, uh... She's OK. Oh, thank goodness. How are you? We haven't really spoken since the party. Liz, I can't get into this right now. Yeah. Do you still want me to join you for your client dinner tonight? It got rescheduled. OK. I'll see you at home? We'll talk then. OK. You're still here? How is she? The doctors say she'll be fine. How'd you know how to do that? I volunteer with children. Kids are in hospital all the time with allergic reactions. Patricia is so careful. I should sue that restaurant. I'm sure it was just an accident. That's no excuse. She could have been killed if you weren't here. Why are you here? I wanted to apologise for this morning. I overstepped. Well, I should call Patricia's husband and... I need to get somebody to cover the desk. I can do it. I can just call my temp agency and have them assign me here for as long as you need. Is there anything you can't do? I updated your calendar for the rest of the week. Thank you. You seem to be burring the candle at both ends. You didn't even touch your lunch. I am so sorry. I should have sent you home hours ago. Do you like Chinese? Huh. Wow. Thank you for this. I didn't even realise how hungry I was. Need me to prepare anything for tomorrow? Uh, no. We can go over it on our run tomorrow. Thought I scared you off. I didn't want you to be right. I think I'm avoiding going home cos I... I just can't talk to Liz, and this idea of a romantic gesture... HE SIGHS I don't know. Maybe I'm just delaying the inevitable. At least you can say you went down fighting. My ex never even tried to fight for us. I thought he was the perfect guy. No such thing. If you don't want to go home, I could get you a hotel room. I heard the Walden's nice. A room at the Walden is tempting, but, uh... I should go home. Liz'll probably be asleep, anyways. Don't worry. I'll clean this up. OK. Um, you think you could stay on for a few more days? Patricia should be back by the end of the week. So soon? They're releasing her from the hospital tomorrow. I'll be happy to cover for her. Thank you. My pleasure. Alyssa? I didn't know the volunteers worked this late. Well, the kids are here 24-7. Some have trouble sleeping, so I keep them company. Oh, so you work on the children's ward? What are you doing on this floor? Coffee break. Care to join? I thought you hated doctors. I was rude at the party. Christina said you're worth getting to know. Well, my shift ends in about ten minutes. I'll meet you at the cafe next door? Sure. Oh, hey. What did you tell him about my ex? What? He knew I moved here to get away from Jason. Did you tell him that Jason was married, too? Who? Craig. I just had coffee with him. I only said it was a bad break-up. Well, you shouldn't have said anything. You're right. I'm sorry. Did you tell him my dad died, too? What? No. That I was just a child when I lost him? Alyssa, I'm so sorry. Don't feel bad for me. I don't need that. I need you to listen. OK? I told you I wasn't ready. And now I have to go on a date with Craig so he doesn't twist things at the hospital and tell people I'm damaged goods. He would never do that. Don't! You've done enough. Alyssa. Patricia. Hi. How are you feeling? I'm fine. I really appreciate you covering for me, but I'm back now. You don't have to be here. Oh, I know. I just wanted to hear the announcement. I'm really proud of Noah. I know I worked for him for only a few days, but... He's a great guy. Yep. He is. Jackson and Ellis is a firm built on loyalty and integrity, so when it came to choosing a new managing partner, we went with someone who gives tirelessly, time and time again. So, it is my great honour to congratulate our new partner... Peter Buchanan. Andrew! Andrew, I respect your decision, but I'm a little confused. If it wasn't for me, we would have lost our biggest client to another firm. You left Carson vulnerable. Did you even bother to figure out who the biological father of his adopted son was? What does that even matter, sir? It was his partner. Carson's wife had an affair. So you did know. His son told me. And what if this son has a change of heart and hands the company over to his biological father? Carson is aware of the risks. There shouldn't be any risk. Peter made sure of that when he revised the contract. We have to protect our clients, Noah. Even from themselves. I knew I should have come back sooner. How the hell did Peter know about the paternity? I saw Peter at the hospital when you were in there. What? You're not suggesting that I somehow told him? Noah... Patricia, I know you would never. I wasn't accusing you. I just meant it was weird he was there so late. But I never saw him. That's because he wasn't visiting. Excuse me. Yeah. We'll celebrate this weekend. Yeah. I need to call you back. How'd you know about the affair? Carson's maid drives a hard bargain. But you had to be sure. So you stole his son's medical records. I protected this firm. You didn't. By putting Patricia in the hospital so you had a reason to be there? Now you're just reaching. It's done, Noah. Andrew made his choice. Deal with it. DIAL TONE Yeah. Sorry, hun. I know. I know. It's exciting, isn't it? Peter couldn't have gotten the records alone. He was working with someone at the hospital. Even if he was, we can't prove it. He's right. It's done. Oh. I wasn't expecting you. I didn't get the promotion. What? Oh, no. I'm sorry. I can't stay at that firm, Liz. Not after this. I'll set up my own. Honey, I know you're upset, but it's not worth throwing away your entire career. You've worked too hard. Why can't you just be on my side? I am on your side. Look, starting a business isn't that simple. I submitted a proposal to the bank for my bakery and they rejected it. If it wasn't for Sam... Sam? Yeah. He offered to advance me the money. Why would he do that, Liz? Because we're friends. You weren't expecting me? I guess you're cooking for him now? I wanted to thank him. Are you sleeping with him? That's what you think? That I'm cheating on you? Get out. All righty, Mr Davis. You're all checked-in for one night in our presidential suite. I'll go ahead and call my bellman for your bags. I don't have any bags. Where's the bar? It's gonna be right over there. Thanks. What are you drinking? How'd you find me? Figured you'd avoid going home and take my offer up on the hotel. I was wrong when I told you not to fight dirty. I could never do what he did. Of course not. You're a good guy. You're perfect. If the firm can't see that, they don't deserve you. What he did... If it got out... it could ruin the firm. I made that place what it is. It's my legacy. How can I just turn a blind eye? What's that? Security footage from the hospital. What? I was right. Peter bribed one of the doctors. How did you get... Look... It's better if you don't know. That's the only copy. I deleted the original. Alyssa, you... You shouldn't have done that. How else do you expect to start your own firm? It's not like your boss would let you keep your clients without any leverage. No. Liz is right. I'd be throwing everything away if I left. So then stay. And take back your promotion. You deserve to be happy. Morning. Noah, it's OK. No. I shouldn't have done this. It's what you needed. To feel valued, wanted... No, Alyssa, I... I can't do this. You don't need to say anything. I know what this was. You really are the perfect guy. 'Noah, I didn't want to do this over the phone. 'I'm not having an affair. 'Please come home so we can talk about it.' Good morning. What are you doing home? I just had brunch with my mom. Just grabbing my books. Oh. How is she? Fine. Somebody's in a good mood. As a matter of fact, I am. You didn't come home last night. You're wearing yesterday's clothes. Did you hook up with Craig? Sorry, I'm staying out of it. I'm staying out of it. But, did you? Guilty. Details. OK. He was amazing. Perfect. Really. I'm so happy for you guys. We should get drinks. It's not even lunch time. Tonight. Is Craig working? I'm not sure. I can ask him. I can text him. Christina, I can manage my own life. Thanks. I mean, I'm heading to the hospital anyway, so I'll ask him, OK? Alyssa! Scotch. Neat. So... You waiting for someone? Are you? My wife and I have an understanding. Does she know that? Wine. Wine not! She's not answering my texts. Craig, she said she'd be here, right? Yeah. Well, then stop worrying. She lives here. She'll be here. Now that Patricia's back, you can be my secretary. Mm. Administrative assistant. Whatever. So, do you feel guilty, stealing that promotion? I didn't steal anything. It's just business. Got to play to win. Like chess. He takes your knight. You take his bishop. Something like that. You're cute. Then all is fair. You wanna get out of here? Maybe. What do I have to do to make that a yes? Can I borrow your phone? Mine's dead, and I should let my roommate know I probably won't be home tonight. Barkeep. Close it out. You wanna ride with me? I have my own car. All you have to do is follow me. You trying to get away from me? Sorry I'm late. I had this thing for work. Wow. You look... Incredible. Thanks. I need a drink. We finished the wine. No, there's more in the kitchen. I'll get it. No. I got it. I'm gonna marry that girl. That's just the sex talking. I can't believe you guys already hooked up. So racy. She told you? She couldn't stop smiling this morning. She really likes you. Yeah, she practically ripped my clothes off. We're gonna make beautiful babies together. I like a woman that can plan my future. Andrew. Glad you stopped by. We need to talk. Peter was in a car accident last night. What? Is he OK? Funeral arrangements are being made. What the hell happened? His blood alcohol level was over the limit, and, apparently, there was something he couldn't live with. You mean, he killed himself? I don't know, he, uh... He texted me, er, saying his conscience got the better of him and that he didn't want the promotion if it was based on a lie. That doesn't sound like him. I think he got spooked by someone. I just received this by courier. It's footage of Peter sneaking out of the hospital. Now, on its own, it's nothing, but if the doctor he paid to get those medical records comes forward... The firm could be held culpable. Noah, uh, we need you. You think this is how I wanted the promotion? By default? What do you want? What are you doing here? Running. Liz, wait. Have you been working out? As a matter of fact, I have. Why didn't you call me back? I'm sorry. For everything. Can you forgive me? Is it work? No. Uh, I took some time off. How much time? Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Can we do dinner tonight? Christina said you cook now. I could always cook. You just never let me. Uh, I should take care of this. But I'll see you tonight. Six o'clock? Sure. Alyssa. Hi, babe. There's a cute breakfast stop that's nearby. I thought you said there was one copy. What? USB drive, Alyssa. You sent another copy to Andrew when I told you I didn't wanna use it. Then tell him what I did. You can't, can you? Because you know I'm right. Are there any more? No, I swear. Is what I did so bad? You can have whatever you want now. I told Andrew I would handle it. Who was working with Peter? Don't worry. I took care of it. My mom and I have run so many miles here. Go easy on me. I didn't grow up running marathons. Race you to the stairs. Go! Wait, what? Oh, please don't hate me. I did this for you. For us. What are you talking about? Dad! Christina. What is going on? We didn't wanna hurt you. We're in love. What the hell? Alyssa, get your hands off my father. It's not like that. It just happened. How could you do this to Mom? No, don't touch me. You're disgusting. Christina, that's your dad. Show some respect. I want you out of my apartment. OK. You're being immature. Besides, I signed a lease. Noah, you're a lawyer. Could you please weigh in on... OK. OK. Enough. You're defending her? Come on, come on, come on. Who are you? Christina! You should probably stay here tonight. I'm sorry. Don't. It's not your fault. I'll get you a room here, OK? I can just stay with you. That's not happening. You're just worried your wife will find out. Noah, she probably already knows. I don't want to hurt her any more than I already have. But you have to. It's the only way we can be together. We could get a place of our own. We barely know each other. But we love each other. I love my wife. Babe, what are we doing? Looking for answers. Look. I know you're upset, but we shouldn't be in here. I have to figure out who she is. By invading her privacy? She seduced my father. And that's not the first time she's gone after a married man. Wait. What? Who's this? Her ex. If I can figure out who he is, maybe he can tell me more about her. Looks like he's my dad's age. I guess she does have a type. He knew I moved here to get away from Jason. Did you tell him that Jason was married, too? And I know his name. Christina, what are you doing? Searching doctors named Jason in Texas. It's a needle in a haystack. I know. There's thousands of them. Christina? I don't wanna talk to him. Just give him a chance. Honey, please. How long? Not long. Are you... in love with her? It's not about love. Alyssa's... It's different. And I know I've no right to ask you this... I'm not gonna lie to Mom for you. No. No, I don't want you to. Just... give me time to tell her myself. Are you getting a divorce? Sweetheart, you've never been married. What is that supposed to mean? You don't understand the sacrifices that you have to make. I'm sorry we made your life so miserable. Honey... I love you. And I love your mother, but we were so young when we had you. Younger than you are now. Get out. Christina. I said get out. Looks like you're baking for a small army here. Yeah. I had six orders come in last minute. Back-to-back. You need some help? Sure. Stir that. OK. You know, I heard the news about Peter. It was just awful. Yeah. Can't believe he's gone. I was thinking, tomorrow, I could bring some food over to his wife. Yeah. I'm sure she'd appreciate that. I can't imagine what she's going through right now. Noah, if that had been you... What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just glad to be home. Here you go. Wow. You really can cook. You don't remember? When Christina was born, you were so overwhelmed that I literally had to learn to cook. I remember never sleeping. Kind of like right now, with the business taking off. I bet you're loving every minute of it. Just like when Christina was born. Honestly, it's a dream come true. And I should have considered that before shooting down yours. Whatever you wanna do, I believe in you. Um, so, I talked to Andrew. I told him I could start my own firm. But he agreed that I'd already built one. He's giving you the promotion. Yeah. Name on the door, everything. No more 80-hour work weeks. Really? Really. Honey! I'll go check it out. OK. Yeah. Just a little bit of whipped cream for me. There you go. Your pecan pie is divine. You want another slice? You can never make too much of them. More coffee? Nah, it's getting late. I should probably go. Oh. You're going back? Yeah. Why? I think we should take it slow. But... I'll come back tomorrow and cook for you. OK? OK. But, Noah, I... Tomorrow. I love you. I love you, too. Alyssa? Stop! I saw you with her. What the hell is the matter with you? I saw you with your wife. You followed me? Are you going back to her? You don't have the right to ask me anything about my wife. She doesn't care about you. Not like I do. No. You should go. So, that's it? You got what you wanted. And now you're just going to go back to a job you hate and a wife... Don't say another word. Your marriage is over, Noah. No, Alyssa. This is. She has a right to know. Are you threatening me? Let go of me! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. You're a liar. And Liz has a right to know. Ow! Don't touch me. Mom? Oh, sweetie. Thank you for coming by so late. Listen. I wanted to let you know, I saw your father today. Are you OK? That's a stupid question. I'm sorry. How could you be. No, I'm fine. It was nice. What? Yeah. He made dinner. It was pretty good, too. And did you talk about anything? We talked about lots of things. We both know we've made some mistakes. But I think we're ready to move forward now. That's all? Oh, and he kissed me. Listen to me, I sound like a schoolgirl. Sweetie, I thought you'd be happy. I am happy. Honey, as a future attorney, you're gonna need a better poker face. Mom, I don't know how to say this. Just say it. Liz. Noah, what are you doing here? You're bleeding. What happened? You told her? I didn't say anything. What's going on? One of you please say something. Christina, I think you should leave. I'm staying here for Mom. What is going on? Dad... I slept with someone. What? Who? Alyssa. Your roommate? She was helping me to start training to run again, with you. And then Patricia got sick, and she started helping out around the office and... The rest just happened. It was just one time. You knew? Mom, I'm so sorry. Liz, it's not her fault. I wanted to be the one to tell you. Liz, please. I love you. I can't live without you, Liz. Please... I'm sorry. Did she do that to your neck? Were you with her before you came here? I can't even look at you. I told Alyssa it's over. So, she didn't take it well? No. You must hate me. I don't hate you. You're my father. But you can't even look at me. I see you as a person who's flawed. I was always your hero. I know. What are you going to do about Mom? I know I have no right to ask her for a second chance, but I won't stop trying. I can't. You better go. Yeah. OK. I love you. Alyssa! 'Texas Memorial. Bingo.' She moved out. So they're staying together at the hotel, I guess. He says he broke it off. Does he love her? Mom... They just met. It was only one night. It's not love. None of this would ever have happened if I didn't get an apartment. Please don't blame yourself. He made his choice. He made a mistake. Don't do that. Don't take his side. I won't. Not after the way he hurt you, but I know he still loves you. Even if you never forgive him. I'm sorry. I have to go. Mom... Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Help! Somebody help us! Help! Where's Liz? She's in surgery now. There's nothing you can do but wait. I was in court. I got here as quick as I could. Do they know who did this? Police think it was a robbery. Her purse was stolen. OK. Were there any witnesses? No. Do you know anyone who'd want to harm Liz? No. Are you sure? I said no. Where's Christina? I sent her home to change. She was covered in Liz's blood. Now you're telling my daughter what to do? Noah, this is not the time or the place. Your wife could die. MY wife. Exactly. Is it done? Yeah. We had a deal, right? Depends. On what? If she's dead. No. You told me, if I stabbed her, you would delete the footage. You know what our deal was. You're the one who made a deal, Craig. You sold private medical information to that scumbag lawyer, Peter. Because of you, Noah didn't get the promotion he deserved. You caused my family a lot of trouble. What? Your family? What are you talking... Shut up! God, you're so annoying. Who found the security footage before the cops? So you're not gonna delete the footage? You know what? You're insane. You know that? You started this, Craig. Not me. Well, guess what, Alyssa. The wound wasn't fatal. I'm a doctor. Not a killer. But don't worry. I planted the knife in your car. So you can rot in hell. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing here? You're my wife. I'm gonna get you some water. I heard about Liz. Is she OK? I was... You did this, didn't you? I would never do something like that. Besides, I couldn't have. I was at the obstetrician. What are you talking about? You're gonna be a father again, Noah. I know. I couldn't believe it either. It was only a few days. No. No. You're lying, and you need to leave. Now. But I wanna be here for you. I know you have to take care of Liz, and that's OK. I'm here to help. You are insane if you think there's a future, Alyssa. We do, Noah. We're having a baby. That is impossible. It was one time, and it was a few days ago. And you know that. I thought so, too, but then I took a blood test, and it turns out that... Stop. Ignoring this won't make it go away. You have a responsibility. The only responsibility I have is to my wife. You can't abandon your baby. We're a family now, Noah. All of us! Liz. Dr Allers. That photo you sent me. Was it recent? Yes, it was. All right. You need to contact Detective Deckard immediately. Your lives are in danger. Her name is Victoria Daniels. She killed my wife. What? I'm gonna give you Detective Deckard's direct line. Let me see if I can find his card. Oh, my God. I regret they day I ever met her. When I broke it off, she couldn't handle it. Kept going on and on about how we were perfect for each other. And then, Victoria vanished. Nobody could find her. Not until now. I've seen her driver's license, it says Alyssa Winters. Victoria was smart. She would have changed her identity or stolen it from someone. Wait. I think I remember an article about a missing woman in Texas. 'I'm gonna send you a photo of Detective Deckard's card.' You have to call him immediately. Victoria will destroy your entire family to get what she wants, just like she destroyed mine. Thanks. Alyssa Winters. She was found dead in her apartment. Police suspect foul play. What? Got to take your pain meds. Leave them on the table and go. Liz, can we talk, please? You wanna talk? Why don't you tell me how you could sleep with a girl who's young enough to be your daughter? I was at a low point. I was watching you and Sam get closer, while we were drifting further apart. And ever since Christina was born... Don't you dare bring Christina into this. Please. I have nothing but love for Christina. And you, too, with your competitive nature and the way you talk to each other in your own shorthand. It's a bond I've seen grow since she was born. So, then, what? It's you. And me. I just... I felt so disconnected from you. Since she was born. Wow. That long? It's not always. But sometimes. And I made... a really big mistake. And I got drunk, and I wasn't thinking. And by no means is that an excuse... but it was just the one night, and I would do anything... if I could take it all back. I am so angry. All I wanna do is hate you. I can't. I don't want us to be disconnected. I'm not gonna ask you to forgive me. Not until I've done... everything I can to make you trust me again. OK? Will you go make me some lunch? Yeah. My dad's not answering. He always answers when I call. Marcus, I'm scared. Came to see Liz. I'd appreciate it if you got the hell out of my house, Sam. Look. I know you think I'm trying to break up your marriage... but I never stood a chance. But you wanted one, right? But that doesn't matter. She'll always choose you. He's still not answering. Something's wrong. Call the police, then try him again. Mom? You're weak. Noah! Did she hurt you? It's just cuts on my hands. Stay down! Christina, stop. She's pregnant. Are you? Alyssa, tell the truth. I'm not. I just... I... I just wanted to be loved. Everyone deserves to be loved. Right? Thank you. Mr Davis. I'm Detective Harris. I'm glad you're OK. I just spoke with Detective Deckard about Miss Daniels. We also believe we've found the man who stabbed you, Mrs Davis. Who was he? His name was Craig Porter. He was a doctor. His body was in the trunk of Alyssa's car. We don't have all the details, but can you think of any reason why he would target your family? No. Craig was our friend. He was dating Alyssa. Wait. Did you say he was a doctor? Yeah, I did. Why? I think he attacked Liz because Alyssa was blackmailing him. Blackmailing? Let's talk. Congratulations. Thank you. We should celebrate. We are celebrating. I mean tonight. I'll cook. Deal. All's well that ends well. Yeah. I'm happy for them. Race you to the sugar cookies. Oh, really? You think I'm gonna... Go!
