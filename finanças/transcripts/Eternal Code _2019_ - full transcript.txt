[SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC] [ELECTRONICS SOFTLY BEEPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GUN BARREL CLICKS] [STEPHANIE] Listen, I already told you that until I see the money, there's no offer on the table. - Fuck that. - Excuse me? - This is what you want. - No, I don't! - You want this. - And don't you touch me! - Fine. - You piece of shit. - Is this what you want? - [GASPS] Ah! - [STEPHANIE CHOKING] - [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Fuck you, bum. [FISTS THUDDING] [COREY] Come on, let me help you. Yeah, okay. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] Bridget, you're just not seeing this clearly, so let's do it like this. The weapons that we use to defend our country, if they were to fall in the hands of, let's say, the bad guys, they could utterly destroy us and all of our citizens. So ensuring that the guns stay out of the hands of the bad men should be of highest priority, should it not? Do you think there is a way to control this? Every time the government has tried to control anything, it has failed; Be it drugs, alcohol, pretty much anything they've ever tried, right? That's because we are dealing with an absolute. You cannot control everything all the time. You may be able to control some things some of the time, but you cannot control everything all the time. There is always leakage. I get that! But we know, all right? We know that they're selling this technology to the highest bidder. And for God sakes, they're already ordering new bodies. Now, I don't understand how this is even a conversation. There's just no reasoning with you, is there? None at all. Someone, anyone, please, help her see the damage that this company would suffer if we were to derail this deal. Please, anyone, speak up. How 'bout down there? - Hey! - [FINGERS FAINTLY SNAPPING] You guys awake down there? Anyone? Magnus? Look, you know my stand. If this would have been available just three years ago, my wife could've had a second chance. We simply can't stop right now. We can't stop right now! [GENTLE MUSIC] The purpose of developing this technology was never so that we could play God, Magnus. - Oh, shit. - [MAGNUS SIGHS] No, I'm sorry. But I suggest not only do we not move forward with this merger, but we should be pursuing further investigation into Intragenetica. What we have suspicions of is not only frightening and immoral, it is also very illegal. And I'm very concerned so many of you are still wanting to move forward. My father founded this company. He had a very strong moral compass, as do I. And I will not be moved. I vote no. - This meeting is adjourned. - Yeah. Adjourned. One, two, three, four, five, six. [BOARD MEMBERS FAINTLY CHATTERING] [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] Always let your heart and your gut guide you. Your brain is not the best place for decision making. Thank you. [CHILDREN FAINTLY SHOUTING] [GIRL] Here you go. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [COREY SIGHS] Nope, come on! [STEPHANIE] Hey, here. It's nice and warm. Thanks. Well, you know where to find me. Thanks, again. I'm not so used to people caring. It means a lot. Yeah, I hear ya. What were ya doin' down there anyway? Long story. Well, I got time. Look, I don't wanna bore you with my life. It's not a very [SCOFF], it's not a very motivational story. Motivational. Well, ya see, maybe that's just it. Your story isn't over yet. The best is yet to come. [COREY SOFTLY CHUCKLES] Maybe. You don't say much, do you? I guess. I guess I'm not much of a talker. Well, if ya wanna be friends, ya need to talk a little bit. See. Tell me something about you. I'm replaceable. [DESPONDENT PIANO MUSIC] [STEPHANIE SCOFFS] Man, I don't know. Bridget's got the veto vote. So what next? I told you this was coming. We need to arrange for a little accident, like I said in the first place. Come on, Oliver. It's a little drastic, don't ya think? Well, we're running outta time and, frankly, we're running out of options. Do you have a better idea? I can talk to her again. [SINISTER MUSIC] All right, here's the deal. You do that, you talk to her. But if you don't get anywhere, I will decide our next move. All right, give me a few days. You have two. [DOOR SOFTLY BANGS] Okay, all right. [CLASSICAL MUSIC] But you don't have to take this stand. It doesn't have to be your fight. No, it didn't have to be my fight, but they made it my fight. What am I supposed to do, Mark? Just pretend I don't know what I know? No, I can't do that. Obviously, you know what you know, but what about everyone else? Why can't they do this? Why you? My father said something to me when I was little. You know what that was? - Yeah. - Yeah? [BOTH] The way you do anything is the way you do everything. [BRIDGET CHUCKLES] Hey, that's a great philosophy, but. No, honey, there are no buts. How could I look Miranda in the eye if I let this go? Okay, I'm not hungry. I ate late today. Leah brought brownies. I probably already ate three. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, no, we're just talkin' work talk. That's all. Okay. [MARK] You got practice? Yeah, leaving. [BRIDGET] Don't be late. [MIRANDA] I won't. I got to do this. Okay. I believe in ya. Oh, thank you. [BRIDGET HEAVILY SIGHS] [SIDNEY] That's about it. Hey, it gives you an extra suckage. - What kinda shit? - Yeah, it gives you suckage. - You got to combo suck it. - I heard that about it. [STEPHANIE] Hey, what ever happened to Nina? [STACEY] I don't know. Fell in love or some bullshit. I don't believe in that fairy tale shit. Why you got to be so cynical? Like [SCOFFS], that's why, all right? How 'bout you tell me your fairy tales, huh? I'm waiting. How 'bout you, Sid? [SID SCOFFS] Yeah, that's what I thought. That's not fair. It's all just some facade that people get trapped in until the monster shows up. Hey, you know it. Maybe not all, but we're all broken. And when you put two broken people together, eventually they'll start breaking each other. [GIGGLES] Listen to little Miss Positivity over here. [LAUGHS] He was fine, though. - He was. - Oh, he was fine. - Oh. - Mm, mm. [LAUGHS] Does that make it worth it, huh? Breakin' your heart? Those looks? I ain't sayin' all that. - Sometimes it's worth it. - All right. [LAUGHS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CHILDREN FAINTLY CHATTERING] [MAN] Here ya go, man. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here ya go. I hope it helps your day. Thank you, I'm sure it will. - Why did you do that? - Do what? Give money to the bums and crackheads. You know, they're probably just gonna buy booze or drugs with that later. I don't really think about that part. I mean, he's in need and I have access, so why wouldn't I try and give a little? [LAUGHS] If you wanna fuel his drug addiction, be my guest. You don't even know that. It's so judgmental, May. You know, let's find out. Wait, what? Come here. Let's watch him. Okay, you wanna watch a homeless guy just to prove a point that he'll just waste the money? Are you serious? [LAUGHS] You're just nervous because you know I'm right. No. You know what? Fine, let's do it. [MAY SOFTLY LAUGHS] [CHILDREN PLAYFULLY SHOUTING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PEOPLE FAINTLY SHOUTING] Uh, what are you guys doing? May, what are we doing? Uh? [HAND KNOCKING] Bridget. Come on, Bridget, please. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] What, David? Back off, let it go, what? Yes, all of that. I mean, why can't you? So a few rich people potentially live forever, so what? Isn't one already too many? If you don't listen, I can't help you. Now, do you really think their rich and powerful people are gonna let you steal their Holy Grail when it's right there in front them? Who gets to decide where it ends? Who gets to decide whose life is precious enough to save and whose isn't? How can you not see the repercussions of this, David? How can you look your family in the eyes and tell them that you stood behind this? Look, all I'm saying is if you don't change your position, I can't protect you. Are you threatening me? [DAVID SCOFFING] After all our years of friendship, you dare to stand there and threaten me because I have the balls to stand up for what is morally right? No, no, I'm saying I can't protect you! I swear, Bridget, you don't even understand what you're up against. Maybe I don't. Maybe I don't. But I know who I'm standing up for. - Oh! - No, I know what kind of a world I wanna leave behind for her. Her, David, your godchild! - Bridget. - Hmm? Okay. Okay. [COREY] Thank you. What can I get for this? - Here ya go. - Okay, thanks. Thanks. Hey, guys. - Hey, guy. - Hey, what up? [COREY] Got us some grub. [UPLIFTING MUSIC] - Bless you. - Thank you, man. Bless you, bless you. I feel like such an idiot. You should. That's terrible, you guys. Okay, that's what everyone says. If everyone lies the same lie, it's still a lie. Yeah, I know, I know. I just kinda feel bad. [MIRANDA] We should do something nice for him. Yeah, sure. I agree, but like what? I don't know, maybe bake or cook something really good? Sure, yeah. Yeah? - Yeah. - Let's go. Yeah. David, listen, I talked with her. I mean, I tried but she's not gonna change her mind. I don't know what they'll do, Mark. Fuck, they can't fire her, so. No, you don't get it. That's the least of what I worry about. What then? Spread lies and rumors to discredit her? No, you don't understand what we're dealing with here. These are some of the most powerful people in the world and she's about to spoil their attempt at life everlasting. I think they'll do anything to protect that. And I do mean anything, Mark. Wow. Wow, okay. I'll talk with her. I'll try again, but you know Bridget. Yeah. Maybe we need protection. - Security? - Mm-hmm. Trust me when I say there's nowhere you can or hide that these people can't reach. I'm here as a friend, remember that. But it's outta my hands now. Thanks for the warning. Yeah, sorry. [SCOFFS] Okay, I'll walk ya out. All right. [CLASSICAL MUSIC] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Check. Hmm, looks like I'm in trouble now. Yeah, indeed, yeah. What are you gonna do about it? Check and mate. Good game, Corey. You gonna do this next week? Yeah, sure thing. And next week, I'm gonna win. You always say that. Well, you can't blame a guy for tryin'. - Hey. - Hey. You don't give up easily, do you? Should I? Well, I'm not much of a talker, remember? Strong, silent type. I like it. [GIGGLES] I just think he's a slow starter. [STEPHANIE CLEARS THROAT] - Stacey? - Yes? Don't you have something to do? Nope. [STEPHANIE] Think you can go find something to do? [SCOFFS] Why do you even bring me? Fine, all right. - [LIPS SMACKING] - Bye. Bye. So, what do you want? [STEPHANIE] [LAUGHS] To get to know you. You are the first seemingly decent person that I have met in a while, so I'm curious. How do you know I'm not just pretending? That's a good question. A conman wouldn't just risk his own life to protect a street girl or share his food with people in need, play chess with a lonely old man and lose on purpose. Who says I lose on purpose? So coffee? Yeah. [SINISTER MUSIC] The target is Bridget. She is to be taken alive and unharmed. Anyone else is nothing but collateral damage and is expected. [SAM] Security? As far as we know, nothing, except her husband. Okay, give me 'til the end of the day. I'll pick up some patterns and we'll likely grab her on her way to or from work tomorrow. No, absolutely not. We are not going to mix work into this. I'd rather it look like a kidnapping for ransom or... [SAM SCOFFS] Take her in her home. No, not a good idea. That's the place with the most variables and the most security, mm-mm. Look, as I explained, this is urgent and I need you to do this without complaining about the rules. That's why there's $5 million in it for you and your boys, savvy? In theory, this sounds great. The problem is what am I gonna do with $5 million if I'm dead or in jail, for that matter? [OLIVER] Guess I chose the wrong crew. Now, hang on. 10 million, five now, five upon completion of the mission, and we'll take her in her home. [LIVELY MUSIC] Okay, I'll support you and stand by you whatever decision you make. But I am serious, this is some scary shit. We're gonna need security. I think you might be right. Good, I made a few calls. They're on their way. Do you really think that... Don't you think we might be just blowing this completely outta proportion? I hope you're right. Where is she going? I don't know. [BRIDGET GROANS] [PHONE CHIMING] [PHONE BEEPS] - Hey. - Hey. Where are you goin'? Oh, me and May are just running out up the road. Okay, well, be back by dark. All right? [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SIGHS] When I came home, I was lost. I expected to come back to the love of my life. Instead, I was handed divorce papers. On top of that, I found out she was engaged to another man. Wow! It's her loss. I didn't have anything left. No home, no family, and then I'm expected to pick up the pieces. I couldn't even find a job that would afford me a place to live. So I started sleeping on the streets, and people look at you like you're a bum. I'm not a bum. I'm a human being and I'm out there and I'm fighting, clawing, and scraping just to survive. And, then, I just didn't see the point. I didn't feel like fighting anymore. I just about quit life. [MIRANDA] Hey, so we made some food for you and anyone else you wanna share it with. - You made this? - Mm-hmm. - For me? - Yeah. I never cooked so much in my life. [MIRANDA LAUGHS] That's really kind. I also grabbed some of my savings. I was gonna buy crap that I didn't really need anyways. Hey, I mean thank you for the food but. I can't take your money. I'll just leave it on the ground. It'll just go to waste I guess. [COREY] What am I supposed to do here? I think she made that pretty clear. [COREY] How old are you guys? - I'm 17. - 16. What Corey is trying to say is thank you. [MIRANDA] You're welcome. Hey! Thank you. Tell your parents they did good. [UPLIFTING MUSIC] I wish there were more people in the world like you. It'd be a better place. No, no, no, no, no. Don't listen to these rumors. Goddammit, I am still managing this project and I promise you, I will continue to do so. [SIGHS] All right, I apologize. But I hear Bridget wants us to hold off and stay on the cadavers until at least the ethics committee can clear us to go forward. Don't you know that we have a chance to be trailblazers here? We can make mortality a thing of the past. We can give someone or anyone everlasting life. I mean, don't you get it? It would be immoral not to. I mean, we must push forward on this. Even the best invention in the wrong hands can be turned into a weapon of sorts. We need to make sure that we're on the right side of history. I agree, but these hands are the right hands. If we have to break a few eggs to make the omelet, we'll do so. Exactly. Sofia, you know, I believe with all the stem cell technologies and the research and everything they're doing right now, trust me, we'll be soon growing our own bodies. And nobody, nobody needs to die to get a new shell. I don't know. [HEAVILY SIGHS] Look, even now, the people we are scheduled to work on are in all legal terms brain dead and the brains are in terminally ill bodies. That's the whole thing. We are giving people a chance at new life. Sofia, what if your mother had a degenerative disease? Now she has a second chance. Magnus, the same thing, you know? Not only should we continue to do this, - we must continue to do this. - Yes! - We have to. - We have to! Oliver, I would like to see Bridget's signature or at least hear her endorsement on this. Not a problem, she's on board. It just takes her a little more time to process things. [OPERA MUSIC] Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. [GLASSES CLINKING] [MARK HEAVILY SIGHS] - We really needed this. - Yeah. Yeah, we did. God, I cannot wait for this stress to be done. Honey, let's try not to talk about it. Let's just forget everything and relax. You're right. Do you wanna watch something? Yeah, sure. [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Is Miranda still up? Oh. Mira? [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [MARK] Mira! [OPERA MUSIC] Mira! [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I can't believe we have to text our own daughter. [LAUGHS] when we're at home to get her. [PHONE CLACKING] [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [DOOR BANGS] [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] - [GUN BANGS] - [MIRANDA GASPS] [GUN POPS] [INTRUDER] Clear. - Down on the ground! - Don't move, on the ground! - Hands up right now! - Hands up, hands up! - Please, sir, please! - No, shut up! - Run! - Go, Miranda! - Run! - Go! - Shut your mouths! - Go! [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Help, help me, help! - My parents... - Whoa! - Or a man that... - Wait, what happened? Guards, a man came to my house. Hey, hey, slow down. I can't understand you. Breathe, now, what happened? [INTENSE MUSIC] They awake yet? I don't think so. [PHONE BEEPING] [PHONE VIBRATING] Yeah. Yeah, we got the packages. Good, further instructions on the way. All right. [PHONE BEEPS] Let's unload 'em. [TENSE MUSIC] [DISPATCHER FAINTLY CHATTERING] [COREY] Hey, what happened here? [OFFICER] Not quite sure yet. I'm friends with the family. Are they safe? [SIREN FAINTLY BLARING] You're a friend of the family? Oh, my clothes? Sorry, I just got back from camping. [DISPATCHER] Mark George is in route to 496. The family's missing and the security guards are dead. Ah, shit, I hope they're okay. Trust me, if these guys wanted 'em dead, they'd be dead. So the fact they're gone is the better alternative. [COREY] [SCOFFS] I guess. [POLICE RADIO FAINTLY CHATTERING] [MARK] [MOANS] Bridget. Honey, Bridget? [AUDIO DISTORTS] Bridget? [BRIDGET] Miranda, where's Miranda? Miranda? [MARK] Shh, shh! [FOOT STOMPING] Listen up! All you have to do is what we say when we say it with no hesitation and you won't get hurt. Do you understand? [MARK] Yes, but I got to couple of questions. Shut up! We will not engage with you unless it's about pissing, eating, or fucking drinking. Follow those simple rules, you might survive this. [BRIDGET] Miranda, where is she? Was I not clear, bitch? [MARK] Hey. - Hey, hey! - [CHARLIE ANGRILY MUMBLING] [BATON THUDDING] [CHARLIE] Hopefully that cleared it up. Don't fuck with me! [DOOR SLAMS] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [MONITOR BEEPING] This makes us operational, correct? No, not just yet. You have to give me another couple of days. Well, with Nikita's help, we should be able to move faster. [NIKITA] Dr. Hermanson. We're breaking so many laws right now, Oliver. - Hmm. - Are you absolutely certain - about this? - Nikita worked on the original draft. Then, she went to Intragenetica, so she knows what she's doin'. She's an expert. She could only help. And I must admit, I am excited. [OLIVER] Hmm. When will it be ready for trials? I'm still awaiting clearance on human trials, but we have done primates very successfully. All I can say is get it done, understood? [SINISTER MUSIC] Fine. [MONITOR CLACKING] There has to be something we can do. I don't know what that would be. Miranda, these guys were professionals. We don't even know who they are. Yeah, and we really just need to get you to family as soon as possible. I don't really have any family. I mean, my grandpa's in New York and my mom's sister's in Miami. We're not close and I don't think I'd be safe. Do you have any idea what this was about? Not sure, but it probably has something to do with my mom's work. They've been stressing over it a lot lately. What does she do? She's the CEO of Bio Engineered Research Ventures. That sounds oddly familiar. Yeah, they did the first head transplant. They were on to something, but my mom wasn't on board. My parents were talking about it and stressing over it, so I'm guessing it's some kind of big deal. [SOFTLY CHUCKLES] That's wild. Yeah, I think I remember hearing about that. They had some guy with a degenerative disease and they put his head on the body of some brain-dead dude, right? Yeah, something like that. They've been doing that ever since. Something else happened and I don't know what. That's unbelievable. When I was in Afghanistan, I watched people lose legs and have other debilitating injuries. This could give them a new body and a new life. Yeah. But now the richest of the rich have their Fountain of Youth, and I'm not so sure it's good to play God. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that are willing to just use this as some Stephen King's "Pet Sematary" and that is kinda creepy. Well, that makes this all the bit more complicated. Why is that? Because they're likely looking for her and they don't care who they take out to get what they want. [COREY SIGHS] [OLIVER] I appreciate your perspective on this, Clive. I really do. Oliver, I understood William's vision for this company, for us, better than anyone except perhaps Bridget. [OLIVER SOFTLY CHUCKLES] And I remember holding her in my arms the day after she was born. Well, who's to say what William would have wanted in today's world? We can't speculate on what William would do. He'd want what's right. Well, William and I were close, but not like you two. But I did see his vision and his passion for life. [DAVID] Excuse me, gentlemen. Oliver, we need to talk. I'm sure we're just wrapping up and seems like it's pretty urgent so, gentlemen. Thank you, sir. [DOOR SOFTLY BANGS] I suppose you've heard. Of course, I did. Are you out of your mind? Guns, kidnapping, murder? I told you I would do it my way if you failed doing it your way, right? Yeah, but I didn't know that you would go this far. You didn't think that I would wait forever, did you? Two people are dead. The whole family is missing. Tell me they're still alive. Of course, they are. And I will let them go as soon as we complete the merger. Merger? Bridget has the veto. She already voted no. I know, but in her absence, the board has the authority to cast her vote and it's looking like it will be unanimous. Yeah, well, Ken'll never vote yes, Maggie's not in favor of it, and Thomas would never vote against Bridget. - No way! - I would not be too sure. My negotiating skills are a lot better than that. [SCOFFS] Yeah, well, you couldn't convince Bridget, now could ya? She doesn't have a vote. Frankly, I'm not convinced I'd vote with ya. [DOOR GENTLY BANGS] - [TENSE MUSIC] - [PHONE BEEPING] [PHONE VIBRATING] Yes? Do you have all three packages? No, I have the two large packages. [OLIVER] What's the status on the little one? I'm not sure. It must have slipped through the cracks somehow. Well, find it. I thought you said it didn't matter. I said find it. I'll see what I can do. [PHONE BEEPS] [DOOR SOFTLY BANGS] [STEPHANIE] Well, it looks better on you anyway. It's weird to see myself like this. I like it. Be careful, they're after her. I'm sure of it. Yeah, we'll lay low, but you need to be careful. Yeah, you got it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Now, don't take any stupid chances. She's a kid, she's gonna turn up. I checked her family. She's got two living relatives. Neither one of them are local. Yeah, I'll see what I can find. All right, and I'm gonna need you to babysit them. You know I don't do that shit. Yeah, but we got to find the girl. [TENSE MUSIC] Fine. All right, we don't talk to them. We don't engage with them. We're here for $7 1/2 million, right? Money. [PHONE RINGS] [SOFT MUSIC] - Hi. - Hi. I have a 3:45 with Bridget. You know, she's not in today. Can I ask what this is regarding? Maybe I can redirect. It's about a charity case. She wanted to meet about our Wounded Warriors Program. Okay, let me see if I can find somebody else to help you. Okay, sure. [PHONE DIAL CLICKING] David? Yeah, there's a gentleman here, said he had a 3:45 with Bridget. Okay, thanks. [CLIVE] Any messages? Yeah. [RECEPTIONIST FAINTLY SPEAKING] Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. Hey, this is not a very good day around here for us. Maybe you should come back another time. I already met with her and she was giving her corporate donation today, so I'd really like to have that before I go. Hey, I don't know if you heard, but us veterans aren't doin' so hot out there. - Could really use the help. - Yeah, yeah. Like I said, it's just not a good day. Yeah, so. When is a good day? I mean, what the fuck's it gonna take? I mean, do we have to start killing ourselves when we get back from serving? Do we put up with the half-assed care - that takes forever to get to... - Okay, listen. Or what about the lack of mental and emotional support just to deal with what we've seen! Ease up. How much? How much was she gonna give? [SOFTLY CHUCKLES] $100,000. Hmm, hold on. Oh, and, yeah, she said she'd dedicate your work to severely injured veterans. Now, who are you? I am a veteran with the Wounded Warriors Project, sir. Uh-huh. [PHONE RINGING] All right, come with me. Now, who are you exactly? I'm a veteran. I'm here with on behalf of the Wounded Warriors Project. [SCOFFS] No, no. Yeah, I don't think so. 'Cause if that was the case, you would have the press here with you and it would be a calendar event for us here and it would be on my schedule, which it is not. So, again, who the hell are you? Just a concerned friend who stopped by her house. A friend? Oh, good, I should know you then. Because, you see, Bridget and I have known each other for over 40 years. I don't remember seeing you at any family functions, so how close would you say you two are? Not really for a long time. David, I'm gonna level with you. Level with me? Now? Okay. You see, Bridget was actually looking to hire me as security. Now, why would Bridget suddenly need security? If you two were so close, I'm sure you'd know. I don't know what you're up to or who you really are, - but maybe security can help... - David, David! - Me get some clarity on that. - Let me. [INTENSE MUSIC] [ELEVATOR DINGS] Shit. Get him! [FIST THUDS] [DOCTOR] Whoa! [SECURITY GUARD GROANING] - Guard? - Shh. - No. - Be quiet, be quiet. - Guard, please! - Hey, what are you doin'? I have to use, I have to use the washroom! I got to go. [CHARLIE] All right, all right. I hear ya. You first. All right, come on, get up. Up, up, up, up, up. - Don't try anything funny. - Be nice. [CHARLIE] Shut up! [DOOR SLAMS] Piss. Not now, I can't. I can't with you just standing there. [CHARLIE] So you don't have to pee? No, I do, but can you just [MUMBLES]. [CHARLIE] Do you have to piss or not? I don't have the patience for this bullshit. [URINE SLOSHING] Done? Oh, you think I enjoy this? Don't flatter yourself, bitch. Up. [UPBEAT TECHNO MUSIC] [HAND KNOCKING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [UPBEAT TECHNO MUSIC] I got it. [DETECTIVE] Hi, Detective Sharpe. I just need to ask you and your parents some questions. Honey who is it? It's a cop or a detective. Sorry. Hi, Mom. I just have to ask you a couple questions is all. Sure, can I get you something to drink? No, thanks, I'm good. I just have to ask you, do you know anything about the Pellegrini kidnapping? Just what we've heard on the news, I'm afraid. Hmm, well, we've been informed that, likely, the young daughter, Miranda, has escaped and may be hiding with some friends and these men are after her. [MOTHER] We haven't seen her. Right, May? No. No? Well, it's urgent that we do find her before these kidnappers do, as they are armed and dangerous. No idea where she could be? No, I mean, if she escaped, she'd probably be here and she's not. Well, sorry for the bother. Thank you. I'll be seeing myself out. Do you have a card with a number we can call in case we hear something? - [CARTER MANIACALLY LAUGHS] - [SOFT SINISTER MUSIC] You know, I think I mighta left 'em in my other coat. But I can get back to you, okay? That's okay. What's your extension and your name, again? It's Officer Sharpe, extension 146. Detective Sharpe. Detective Sharpe, yes. Extension 146. [GASPS] Jesus, you could ring the doorbell. Sorry. [STEPHANIE] So? Do you know David at your mom's work? Yeah, why? Is he close with your mom? [MIRANDA] Yeah. Would you trust him? I mean, as much as I trust anyone right now, I guess. But they go back? I doubt he'd do any harm to any of us. He pretty much comes to any of the family functions. Okay, well, I'm headed back out, but a few things before I go. [ZIPPER WHIZZING] You ever use one? Yeah, my ex brought me to the range. Good, show her how to use it. Where are you going? To see if David's our guy. Easy, nothing stupid. I shoulda known you were involved. Involved with what? [SCOFFS] With Oliver. [STAMMERING] Are they okay? Please, at least tell me they're still alive. No, you got it all wrong. I'm not the guy you need to be concerned with. Miranda said I can trust you. So I'm giving that a try. She said that? Yeah. [SCOFFS] I couldn't stop Oliver; The merger, whatever plans they have out. I know very little about this situation. But if I'm gonna help, I need to know what you know. Do you mind? It's a long story but... Okay, we're the lead research company in the transplanting of human heads and we did a prototype with Intragenetica; Essentially, downloading the brain and then planting data in another host brain and body. Well, we found out that, after some successful trials, they were keeping a waiting list of people and they weren't exactly people in need, if you know what I mean. They weren't waiting for bodies with nonfunctioning brains. They were actually ordering their new perfect bodies and faces and... - Bridget said no. - Yeah. Yeah, Bridget's always done everything for all the right reasons. She learned that from her father. So, yeah, yeah, she used her veto to stop the merger and it slowed 'em down, but I believe she was, she was considering exposing them. Now, I tried to talk some sense into her, but she's just so... - Honorable. - [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Yeah, I was gonna say stubborn but... [DOORBELL RINGS] Okay, look, I better get that. Hide back there. Okay, nothin' stupid. Tell 'em what they wanna hear. [INTENSE MUSIC] [OLIVER] I hope I'm not interrupting. No, I was about to have a nightcap and go to bed. I thought I should drop by and see if everything's all right with you. - Anybody else here? - No. No, it's just me. - Why? - Just curious. So, how are you voting? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] You know, it's tomorrow. It just seemed you were a bit unsure. Well, no, no, I was just frustrated. - Frustrated? - Yeah, I was frustrated and I shouldn't and I'm sorry. Look, I really shouldn't of. I apologize. I apologize and I will vote yes. You're going to vote yes? [DAVID] Of course. That's good. That's very good because I would hate to lose another executive. I'd have to do all of your work, as well. It's a nice place you have here. You should have me over sometime. Maybe for a nightcap or something. It's just an idea. Good night to ya. Shh! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [MARK] Hey, is somebody out there? Help! What I need to do - is to shut the fuck up! - I need water. [MARK] Hey! [CHARLIE] Hey, get down! - Get the fuck down now! - All right. [CHARLIE] Fuckin' sit down now. Do you want me to fucking put a bullet through her head? Do you want me to fucking shoot her? - I'll fucking shoot her! - Please, don't hurt us. All right, please, don't hurt us. - Please. - Shut up, fuck! I am so sick and tired of babysitting you two little fucks. I need you to shut the fuck up. We're just so thirsty. Please, you said you'd give us food and water, and we haven't gotten anything yet. [CHARLIE] Well, it's not here yet, bitch, so what the fuck do you want me to do about it? Shut up or I will fucking shoot her. Fuck! [BRIDGET SOFTLY SOBBING] Fuck! [CHARLIE HEAVILY SIGHING] [PHONE BEEPING] [PHONE VIBRATING] Mamacita, [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. Hey, where's the fuckin' food? I must stay here a couple more days and watch things. Dude, I'm about to lose it on these two fucks! Hey! [PHONE BEEPING] [PHONE VIBRATING] - Hey. - Yeah? I need the food. These fucking people won't shut the fuck up and I need to feed them so they can shut the fuck up. Fuck. Fuck! [INTENSE MUSIC] Dammit, Oliver, you scared me. These are scary times. What are you doing here? What the hell? My associate, he's a bit eccentric, wouldn't you say? Now, Mr. Pomeroy, where were we? Oh, yes, that's right, the vote tomorrow. What about it? Well, you haven't seem to be in favor, so I thought I'd have one last opportunity to convince you otherwise. You will not get a unanimous vote, Oliver. I'm sure there are others like me that morally can't do this, not to mention Bridget would never go for this. Don't be so sure. I've visited every one of you old dinosaurs tonight and you're the last one left to convince. - Dinosaurs? - Dinosaurs. I'm sorry, you're wasting your time. Listen. I don't know and, honestly, I don't care what you do with me. You will not get my vote. I was here when William started this company and I know... [GUN BANGS] [SAM] [SCOFFS] What the fuck did you do? - Fuck him. - Yeah, but, Jesus Christ, there are cameras everywhere. [OLIVER] Oh, yeah, there are. Hmm, yeah. [SAM] They have your face, Oliver. Well, let's get outta here. Come on. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SIREN FAINTLY BLARING] [PHONE BEEPING] [PHONE CHIMING] [PHONE BEEPS] - Hello? - Hey. Hey, it's me. Wait. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. But, hey, don't tell anyone that I called you. There was a guy here earlier. He was looking for you. He had a badge and said he was a detective, but I'm not so sure. I don't know who we can trust. Okay, where are you? Remember Corey, the homeless guy? [MAY] Of course. I figured no one would know and I wouldn't risk anyone's life. They killed our security and I don't know what happened to my mom and dad. I'm sorry. Yeah, some kinda special forces or something. Well, I guess that's needed right now. - Right? - Yeah. And his girlfriend or something, I guess. Where are you, Mira? [SIGHS] I don't think it's safe to tell. But don't worry, I'm safe. And I should probably hang my phone up right now. But, seriously, don't tell anyone. Not even your mom. Okay, I promise. Be safe. You, too. [PHONE BEEPS] [TENSE MUSIC] Holy Grail. [ENGINE REVS] - Yes? - Is it ready? Oh, yeah. We got to find a way of breaking outta here. Maybe we should just ride this out. Do you think they're gonna let us go? [TRAIN WHISTLE BLARING] They're wearing masks. They let you go to the bathroom. Hell if I know. No, this has everything to do with the merger. - It has to, right? - Yes. Right, so why would they let me to go so that I could blow up everything they did while they held us hostage? Yeah, ya got a good point. So, how? What's your plan? We got to figure it out. Well, we got to get these off. Fuck. [SOFT INTENSE MUSIC] All right. Ow, okay. Got it. [SAM WHISTLING] No sudden moves or I empty this gun in your back. [SIGHS] What do you want? Shh, keep your hands on the steering wheel. Don't try me. It won't end well for you. [SAM] What do you want? Information. [SAM] What? Where is Bridget and her husband? Who? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. [GUN THWACKS] Now let's go for a drive. [ENGINE REVS] [CLOCK TICKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GATE CREAKS] [SLOW TENSE MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - [MAY GASPS] - Hi. You lookin' for somebody? No, no. I thought I left my phone around here somewhere. [CARTER] Let's just stop playing games, okay? What do you mean? You're looking for Miranda. No, no, no, no, I was just... - [HAND THWACKS] - [MAY SCREAMS] That was me being nice. Hand over your phone. I won't ask twice. What's your passcode? There isn't one. Let's see if we have any unsaved numbers here. [GASPS] Look at that. Come with me. [CARTER WHISTLING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] You're on my time. Okay. We're gonna find out how badly you wanna live. [SAM SCOFFS] [SIGHS] There are other people involved. Even if I wanted to help you, you'd be fucked. This thing is way bigger than either you or I. I don't worry about the odds too much. That makes me dangerous. And the fact that I am trained and skilled beyond any of you fuck boys is another advantage. Not to mention, you don't even know I exist. - Oliver. - What? Oliver, he is the guy behind it all. He's the guy with the plan. He's the guy with the money. - Oliver, huh? - Yeah. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] So, are you saying I don't need you anymore? No, no, no, no, no. That is, no. Who is gonna get you in and out of everything? Who is gonna lead you to the hostages if anything happens? Listen, man, you need me and you know you do. [UPBEAT TECHNO MUSIC] Guard, guard! Guard, he needs his insulin, please! Hurry! Fuck! What is it? - [MARK GRUNTS] - [CHARLIE GROANING] - Shoot her! - It's not working! - [GUN POPS] - [BRIDGET SCREAMS] [CHARLIE MOANS] - [INTENSE MUSIC] - [WOMEN THUDDING] Fuck. Oh, my God, come on. Come on. [MARK FAINTLY SPEAKING] Let's go. - Come on. - We have to get out. [PHONE CHIMING] [STEPHANIE SIGHS] [PHONE BEEPS] I told you not to call. Well, hello, there. [SINISTER MUSIC] Who's this? A friend of a friend. May's here, too. Say hello, May. [MAY SHRIEKS] May, are you okay? As long as you play along, she's got nothing to worry about. Where are you? I'm not sure. Well, you better figure that out fast. I don't know how. Well, if you want your friend to be okay, you better start figuring that out pronto. I don't know how. Are you inside? Yes. Okay, go to a window, look outside. It's them, they have May. Hey! None of that shit. What? Don't think I'm stupid. Do you want to see your friend hurt? Don't touch her. Okay, then, you're gonna listen to everything I say. I see a street and cars parked. Okay, do you see any street signs? Not from here. Are you alone? Yes. Right now, yes. Okay, get out there as fast as you can. Once you get to a street, call me. And, Miranda, your friend's life is in your hands. Do you understand me? I understand, I'll hurry. Good. I'll get you somewhere safe. [MIRANDA SIGHS] [SIGHS] Nobody home. So now what? Where are they being held? Come on. [SCOFFS] I know you're not too bright. I didn't know you were deaf. A warehouse just outside of town. And how many men? Two. Show the way. [ENGINE REVS] [KEYBOARD CLACKING] - [NIKITA MOANS] - [ZIPPER WHIZZING] You ready? Almost. Good. You've done well, Nikita. Thank you, sir. [LIPS SMACKING] I have to admit, I am [HEAVILY BREATHING] eager. Look. Behold, the Fountain of Youth. [SLOW TENSE MUSIC] [MARK] Fuck. Who are you? Drop your weapon. I'm Detective Sharpe with the police department. We got a call. If you don't drop that weapon, I will kill you. Show me your badge. Right there, see, see that? [MARK] I don't believe you! [CARTER] I'm here to help, but if you don't drop that weapon, I will kill you. He's with the cops, okay? - No, please. - Bridget. Please, we were kidnapped. We just got out; We were in there. There's somebody in there. I shot her; It was self-defense, I promise. - I promise it was. - Bridget! - It was, someone in there? - Yes. But, Mark... - No, ah! - [GUN BANGS] Mark! [SOBS] [FIST THUDS] - [SINISTER MUSIC] - [MAY SOBBING] Please, please don't do this. If you ever want to see your daughter again, shut your mouth. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [DOOR SOFTLY BANGS] Help me! [ENGINE REVS] Please, someone! [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SIGHS] Okay, guys. Do we all know what to do? I don't like it but, yeah, yeah. Oh, Sidney. You don't have to do this. You know, you can leave. I would love your help, but I know it's dangerous and I totally understand if you walked. Naw, I mean, I'd hate myself if I did that, ya know? Besides, I've never really done anything heroic, so I think it'll make me feel a little bit better. [SIGHS] Stacey, are you sure? Of course, Steph. [STEPHANIE HEAVILY SIGHS] This all depends on you. You have to get him out of the car. If you can't do that, then we're all screwed. Yeah, I know. We got this, all right? [INTENSE TECHNO MUSIC] - Yeah. - Let's do this. [ENGINE RUMBLING] - [CARTER WHISTLES] - [FINGERS SNAPPING] [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Come, come, come, come, come. [TENSE MUSIC] [MIRANDA] First, show me that they're okay. You want me to make an example outta her, huh? Go! - [GUN BANGS] - [SIDNEY PAINFULLY SHRIEKS] [STEPHANIE] What the fuck? Fuck! Fuck! [STACEY] Oh, my God! [GROUP FRANTICALLY SOBBING] - I'm sorry. - Oh, my God, fuck! [MIRANDA] I'm sorry, Sidney. [SIDNEY SOBBING DROWNS OUT MIRANDA] [STEPHANIE] Sidney, don't you quit. Don't you quit on me! Sidney. [MIRANDA SOBBING] - Sidney? - No. No, it's all my fault. You listen to me, this is not your fault! You didn't ask for your parents to get kidnapped! You didn't want this. We have to go, we have to go! - Stacey, no! - What? I can't have that, too, on my conscience. No, you do not make that decision! - What? - Let's go! No, no, no! We got to go. We got to go. Come on. Come on. Come on! [MIRANDA] Oh, Stacey! Oh, my God! [INTENSE MUSIC] Slow. Slow. Stop, stop the fuckin' car. Okay, get out slowly. Keep your hands where I can see them. I'm sure you have a backup on you somewhere. Go. Okay, hey, keep your back turned to me. Hands on your head. All right, you're gonna lead the way. Any sudden movements means you're dead, copy? - Yeah. - 'Kay. [SAM] Aw, shit. Slow. Okay, check him. Grab his wallet. Give it. Hands on your head. Hands on your head! Fuck. Stand up. All right, let's go inside. Move. [DOOR SQUEAKS] Nice and slow. Shit, this is not good. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Looks like an eye for an eye to me. I guess we're done here. [PHONE VIBRATING] Hands up! Talk. God, where do I start? [COREY] At the beginning, I'd guess. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [OLIVER] Hey, can we get started? In a couple of hours, it should be ready, but you won't. We need to get your body temperature down and induce a medical coma. We need to get started. Just let me make a few calls. We need four to five hours to prep you, Oliver. We definitely need to get started, like, now. Absolutely, just let me make a few calls. I'll be right back. Did we get all of this guy's information? Yes, we are securing off-shore accounts - in his name right now. - Okay. I guess I should say your name. John Michael Willis. John Michael Willis? Now, you're gettin' it. I'll be right back. [SINISTER MUSIC] [CARTER HEAVILY SIGHS] Charlie is dead, your husband is dead, and I can't reach Sam. If you let us go, I have enough money that you could just disappear and you could live a long life. [CARTER SOFTLY CHUCKLES] Don't you wish it was that easy. [BRIDGET] [SNIFFLES] Why isn't it? I can't just walk away. Charlie is dead and I got a bad feeling Sam is dead, too. And leaves Oliver and whoever he's with. And from what he tells me, he can look like anybody, so how the hell am I supposed to have peace of mind? Just disappear, that's all. [MAY SOBS] [SCOFFS] Oh, just disappear? Where hundreds of millions of dollars can't reach? But, I don't know, why would he care? Because I know. Yeah. I know. [SINISTER MUSIC] We know where Oliver lives and where he works, but we don't know much about this kidnapper. But this fucker does. I don't much about him. We got assigned together. You smell that? - No. - It smells like bullshit. You really expect me to believe that you'd hire a team, you don't have synergy with individuals? They don't know their roles? They don't stay in their lanes? [SCOFFS] Come on, Sam. Sammy. [CHUCKLES] I'm not fuckin' stupid. Come on, man. His name is Carter. He's ex-CIA. I've done two extractions with him. - Happy? - Two? No, I'm not happy. Two extractions? And where is Carter now? Last I knew, he was staking out her friend's place. [SCOFFS] I'd say that's pretty goddam obvious since he has them both. And I'm not so sure I should believe in this bullshit about you not having a FUBAR location 'cause that also smells like bullshit. Don't know what to tell you. All right, little boy, keep your mouth shut. [COREY SIGHS] I guess we can wait or storm a heavily-guarded mansion. I vote wait. [MONITOR BEEPING] Let's drop the subject down another two degrees, okay? And let's slow the heartbeat and the breathing down at least another 20%. I'm on it. I need benzodiazepine stat and start morphine, phase two. Next, we need the ice packs, okay? Let's lower both of them down, all right? To like 15 degrees Celsius and hold them there, please? Let's hold 'em down, okay? Okay, Magnus. Ready? [SIGHS] If I ever was. I don't know, maybe waiting was a bad idea. Maybe we need to [SIGHS]. - [PHONE RINGING] - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Hello? Who is this? It's a friend of the family. Ah, well, you're gonna want to do exactly what I say. Welp, I think we have things to talk about here. It's your dad. Tell him we need to talk. He's military, we're lost. Hey, it's me again. Okay, what do you want? A trade, get your little boy back and I get May and Bridget. [CARTER LAUGHS] Nice try but no deal. You sure? - [KNIFE SQUELCHES] - [SAM GROANING] What about now? [SAM PAINFULLY MOANS] Listen, [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE], you can have the girl, but I'm keeping the lady. She's worth $400 million. 'Kay, deal. We meet in a public area. I'll call you back in 10 minutes. [HAND KNOCKING] Yes? Ah, Sofia, please. Yeah, thank you. May I ask what this is regarding? It sounded urgent. Well, I haven't been able to reach Jeremy, Magnus, or Oliver. Of course, Bridget's still missing. So, yeah, I'm worried. Well, yes, I would be as well. [DAVID] Well, would you happen to know where any of them are? [SOFIA] I can call him. But it is possible that he's just busy. I already called. We have an entire dual unit missing. Would you happen to know why that is or where it might be? Seems that Magnus and Oliver checked it out for testing. No, sir. No, I don't. Now, if you're trying to insinuate something, let me remind you, I have been a long-time supporter of Bridget and I have been here longer than any other scientist... - Sofia, Sofia, no! - I have sat... No, I'm not insinuating anything. Nothing at all. Hell, at least you're here and that tells me a lot, but I still need to figure out what's going on. I can't think of anything that could possibly be of any use. I'm so sorry. It's okay. If anything turns up, please don't hesitate, okay? Of course, of course. - Sir? - Hmm? Are we in danger? Okay? What now? We both go on three. They both walk separate and turn back to back when they pass each other. [CARTER] Okay. Don't fuck this up! We're not done yet. Shut the fuck up and do as you're told. Okay, here we go. One. Two. Three, walk! [TENSE MUSIC] Pow! [MAY EXCITEDLY GASPS] They have nothing linking us to the apartment, so you should be safe here. Which means, you two, stay put from now on. What about my mom? The more she knows, the more we risk her safety right now. Now, she's reported you missing, so there's likely active-duty officers at the house. She should be all right. What about my mom? [SIGHS] I still need to figure that part out. I'm gonna need to see David, again. That could be risky, so we're gonna need to come up with a plan B if I'm caught or worse. You got this, Corey. - [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] - [MONITOR BEEPING] Unfortunately, you have to rest a little while longer, sweetheart. All set. Now, we wait. Thank you, Magnus. We couldn't have done this without you. I'm curious. I mean, I know why I did it. What about you? My wife, she passed from cancer. I mean, it spread. It was everywhere. This, this right here, this woulda saved her. I'm sorry. [HEAVILY SIGHS] Hopefully, that won't happen to anyone else. That makes this kill a little bit easier. [GUN BANGS] [BODY THUDS] Go see your wife, Magnus. She's waiting for you. [CARTER] Charlie is dead because of her! [BRIDGET] Charlie's dead because of you. [SLOW TENSE MUSIC] You and your fucking friend. You think you're so perfect, don't you? You think you're so damn smart. Being born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you don't know what it's like to go without, huh? I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I was born poor. You shoulda done your homework. [SCOFFS] I often didn't eat other than what they fed you at school. When it wasn't a school day, I did without. See, my father was an immigrant and he worked his ass off to make changes so that we would have a future. And he knew that if he just put everything he had into education that, eventually, everything would be okay. You know what he didn't do, though? He didn't compromise his character. Do you know what that means or would you like me to explain it to you? You hear Mother Teresa over here? Yeah, I said don't talk to her. Let her be. [CARTER SOFTLY MUMBLING] You wanna judge my character? [INTENSE MUSIC] How is this for character, huh? Huh, smarty? Looks like I hit a nerve. - Didn't I? - Oh, yeah. Just a bullet, just a bullet right in her brain. Carter. Walk it off. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] So, today, before we adjourn, I just wanna say how pleased I am that we were able to, in Bridget's absence, we were able to pass a vote holding off on the merger. And, you know, William would be so proud to see how we conducted ourselves in challenging times like this. And I, for one, I'm damn proud to stand with all of you. So, once again, thank you. That's all I have. [BOARD MEMBERS APPLAUDING] [BOARD MEMBERS FAINTLY CHATTERING] [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hey, Mark is dead. Yeah, I know, I heard. Damn shame. [COREY] Bridget is still missing. Any leads? Just the men Sam used. They're hard to trace. Where's Oliver? That's the odd thing. He's gone and before he left, he and our top scientist, Magnus, checked out a dual unit, fully operational. And Magnus isn't at work today. - I have a bad... - So you're saying they checked out medical equipment? Mm-hmm, fully operational. And they can switch their brains? [DAVID] Mm-hmm, yeah. Jesus Christ, and you can't trace that? All we have are their signatures, but I called security and they're pulling up surveillance to see if we can identify the truck they left in. Find the truck, find the gear, and that will lead us right to them. Yeah, do you wanna come with me to security? Sure, why not? You wanna not call the guards this time? [DAVID SOFTLY CHUCKLES] Sam, we can't hold her forever. We'll need to figure something else out. - [SIGHS] Yeah, I know. - You know? What about their company? They pay. Maybe. The other company? [CHUCKLES] They'd rather see her dead. Hmm, [LAUGHS] somebody else wants to see you dead. Yeah, I could see that. [FINGERS SNAPPING] This David guy. David, who's David? Yeah, I went to his house with Oliver. He seems to be close with the family. It's worth a shot. Should I pay them a visit? Oh, yeah, yeah. [SINISTER MUSIC] I'll text you his address. You got it. There! [DAVID] I'll be damned. [COREY] How do we trace that? Well, it's one of ours. They all have homing devices on it, so it shouldn't be too hard. Let's check this out. We could just take a look here. Should be able to locate all of our trucks. There, there, that's got to be it! [COREY] Where is that? [DAVID] Looks like the storage place down by the freeway. [COREY] 'Kay, let me check it out. No, we got to call in the police. Who knows what we'll find when we get there. No, there's no time, no police. That could get messy. If I can't bring her back safely, then you call the police, but give me the chance. Okay, you have tonight. But tomorrow I call in the police. You're a good man, David. Now, go home, get some rest. Dammit. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [KEYS JINGLING] - Hey. - Hey. - What are you doin' here? - What? We've had some complaints about a bunch of commotion down here and I didn't sign off on any night work. I'm just helpin' 'em out here. Helping them with what? Do you have a badge or something? Yeah, here's my badge. - Now, what are you workin' on? - Hey. I'm just helpin' 'em move equipment. Open the door. Go. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] What's goin' on? What are you doing here? I'd like to ask you the same thing. I have permission and clearance to be here. Do you? I say I call the police and they can sort this shit out. Wait, hold on. Let's talk. Sure. - [FISTS THUDDING] - [GUN CLATTERS] Location B, stat! What should we do? I'm not sure. But the longer it goes on, the less safe we are here. Hold on, hold on, he's coming. [SIREN BLARING] Oh, my God. [SIGHS] Well, I guess we know that Oliver and this Magnus guy are both in on it. They likely brought in mercenaries to grab Bridget. I'd say it's likely they still have her. She's worth money alive, not so much dead. I also ran into some people in at a storage facility. They turned a unit into a medical science room. I'm starting to think that this whole thing is too big for us. I think it's time to call in the police. Do you think my mom is still alive? [COREY] Yeah, I do. How do we know the police are not in on it? I mean, May, she had a shady detective at her place. I just, I don't know what to do right now. [PHONE VIBRATING] Hold on. Hello? David tells me you can get shit done. Is that true? Depends, I'm not great with balloon animals and I don't do clowns. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I have Bridget and David. I don't give a shit about anything but money. I want $2 million today and you can have them both. Where the hell am I gonna get that kinda money? Not my problem, make it happen. I'll call you after the banks close today and we can work this out. But I. [INTENSE MUSIC] [MONITOR BEEPING] Slow, my love. Don't rush. Come to me when you're ready. I'll be here. Are you sure about this? No, but what are we gonna do? We can't keep these two here forever. Besides, they seen our faces. Yeah. You're right. There's not a lotta options left. So you gonna call or you want me to? [SINISTER MUSIC] I got it. Hello? Hey, did you get the money yet? Maybe, not sure. Maybe, what the fuck? Do you wanna see these two mother fuckers alive again or what? Honestly, I don't know them. You're talking to a homeless guy and a hooker that got wrapped up in this shit. We did the best we can. Okay, [HEAVILY SIGHS] Packard plant, 10 o'clock. Come alone. You fuck around and these two fuckers are dead. Packard plant, 10:00 p.m., copy that. You bring them both. - [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - [MONITOR BEEPING] [LIPS GENTLY SMACKING] [GUN CLIP CLICKS] [PHONE VIBRATING] Hello? Are you here? - Yes. - Alone? - Yep. - Got the money? Yes. - Where are you? - I'm inside. You'll see me. Stay put. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Let's rock. [INTENSE MUSIC] Where ya at? Come out where we can see you. Nice and easy. Don't try anything stupid. Everybody wants to go home tonight. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Ah, fuck, where is he? You guys, over there. [SLOW SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CARTER SOFTLY WHISTLING] [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I only want to do some business with you. Where the fuck is he? Carter! Gringo? [SIREN FAINTLY BLARING] I only wanna make some business with you. Gringo? You brought the money. [CARTER LAUGHS] Touche, you son of a bitch. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] - [NECK CRUNCHING] - [CARTER GROANS] I see, you wanna play fuckin' games! You wanna play fuckin' games, huh? All right, we'll play fuckin' games. Who's it gonna be? Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be him? Who's it gonna be, motherfucker? Her or him?
