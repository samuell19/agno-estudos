The Prisoner of Château d'If Based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas "The Count of Monte-Cristo" second movie I will repay Screenwriter: Mark Zakharov with the participation of Georgi Yungvald-Khilkevich Directed by Georgi Yungvald-Khilkevich Composer and Lyricist Alexander Gradsky Haydée, changes will soon happen in our lives We're going to split up. You have come of age, must meet someone and fall in love. Are you telling me? Better kill. You are still a child and do not understand much. I can't marry you. Am I not pretty enough for you? No, you are an amazing creature. The only thing in this world. So embrace me, my lord. I love you I will only love you, not demanding anything in return. Throw away that locket. All right, Debray, thank him on my behalf. - Mr Danglers! - What is the problem? Notice from "Thomson & French". Unlimited credit to the Count of Monte-Cristo. Unlimited credit? I know all these graphics, but for the first time I hear about the Count of Monte-Cristo. When did he show up in Paris? Yesterday or today. All right, go ahead, let's find out. Unlimited Credit! In my opinion, I am perplexed. Dad, let me look in the mirror. Honey, have you ever heard of the Count of Monte-Cristo? I heard that this is a very mysterious person. He's driving all Paris crazy. With what? He never appeared in a fancy frock coat. That's with your wealth something. -What does he appear in? - Only in black. And this is so mysterious. Are we going or not? Is the carriage ready? The carriage has arrived, Lord Baron. Your Excellency, a letter has arrived for you. From Lord Baron Danglars. I refuse. But first take a look here, Baptistin. What do you see here? Lord Baron Danglars' carriage. I told you to get the top four in Paris. Why aren't these horses in my stable? But these horses are not for sale. In our time, everything is for sale. I limit you not in quantity, but in time. Those horses must be in my stable at night. There will be no other case! Lord d'Artagnac I will pay you the annual rent of a brigadier general, if I know every step of your boss, de Villefort. Thanks buy in my name an abandoned house in Auteuil, which belonged to his family. Consider it already yours. The Count of Monte Cristo! I beg. Sorry to keep you waiting. Sit down. Thanks Lord Count, I received a letter recommendation from "Thomson & French". But I admit I didn't understand its meaning very well. What do you see obscure in these words? Just the word unlimited... Is Thomson & French not solid enough? It's pretty solid but "unlimited" sounds a bit vague when applied to finance. What does it mean that if Thomson & French is willing to do crazy things. That's it? Oh, that's what it looks like; gentlemen Thomson & French do business without figures; but does Mr Danglars have a limit to his? Dear Condel nobody counted my cash register. So I'll be the first, who has to do this. You think? I'm convinced. For the explanations you demand of me, are like vibrations. So sir please tell me the amount that you would like to receive. And don't hesitate. If you need a million, say: A million! A million? Lord, if I only needed a million! I would bother you for so little and talk about a loan. A million? A million I always carry in my pocket. Here are 2 Treasury bonds of 500K each. Although I know little about these matters, however, foresaw that opportunity and I took precautions. Here are two other letters similar to the one addressed to you: one is from the Vienna bank Arnstein & Eskeles, for Lord Baron de Rothschild, the other is from Baring Bank. Just say the word and I'll save you the hassle contacting any of these banks. Yes, these subscriptions are worth many millions. You can send me some money, can't you? Name her, count, I am at your service. 10 million. You will have the money tomorrow at 10 am. I must confess, Count, it seemed to me that I was aware over all major European states. Meanwhile, your condition was completely unknown to me. Say... Is she recent? She is, on the contrary, of a very remote date. Well, Danglars banking house is at your service. Mr Danglars, his wife and daughter. Honey, let me introduce you. Our guest is the Count of Monte-Cristo. Very nice. - My daughter Eugenie. - I'm fine too. Paris is thrilled. Young Earl of Morcerf contributes a lot to this. His account of the Roman catacombs is unparalleled. Unbelievable rumors circulate about me far too often. I think you give a reason. I won't bother you, but I'll ask Mr Danglars to explain explain to me the disappearance of my horses. This is a very funny story. This morning some kind of crazy offered me 16,000 francs for them. Yes, I was always afraid of your excessive playfulness. They are only suitable for a young person. - You sold them! - Yes, I did. That's disgusting, sir. I can't find the words. I'll buy you a matching pair. It is impossible to buy these horses a second time. The value that was offered by them... Today my manager bought it for me four quite acceptable and cheap, only 25,000. They're standing here, take a look. I see you know a lot about horses, ma'am. And I would be curious to know your opinion. Take a look. Count, these are our horses. It can not be Mrs Danglars, I'm not familiar with local customs, I ask you to show condescension to my oriental style. I spent almost half my life in the East. I beg you, do not refuse my first request. These horses must return to their stable. Deign to accept this humble gift, witnessing my respect for you and to Lord Danglers, to whom I owe a lot. Sorry, I have to leave you. You are a scoundrel, a crook and a nothing. Not 16, but 25 thousand! Go home, honey. A four was worth 9! Well, daddy, it's over! I won 15 grand and the horses stayed. Shut up, you idiot. Good evening, Monsieur d'Artagnac. Did you issue a sales invoice? Now this house is your property. The porter will show his property, if you want to. His name is Jean. I would like to explore the garden. - Can I go freely? - Yea. Monsieur d'Artagnac, thank you. - I'd like to see the garden. - I beg you. No, no, you're free to go. No, I won't. That will do Bertuccio. You are a Corsican, Bertuccio, and you know the harsh laws of revenge. You swore you didn't cover up a single crime. - You tricked me. - No! No! I'm afraid! Murder in France... Yes, it's a tasteless performance. So I tried to forget about it! - You'll have to remember. - No! Your Grace, I beg you! It will be a disgusting story. And I don't expect Christmas stories from you. I can not! I will not be able to. I'll help, I'll show you the garden myself. No! I do not want! - I demand. - I do not want! I order. I defended my brother. The prosecutor wanted him dead. He knew my brother was innocent! He deliberately protected his assassin-brother. What kind of person is this? Royal Attorney Villefort. And so I swore revenge on him. A bloody revenge. I won't stop for anything. I'll kill him! Yea! I swore to kill you! I followed on his heels. But every time he eluded me. Like a snake! I waited until morning, but he didn't show up. In this abandoned house! I waited until the next morning, but he never came out. Next time, I found it again. But the woman was already in position. I thought it was going to kill him this time! I couldn't take revenge that night. - You didn't recognize her? - No. Later, however, I learned that she had married a banker. Danglers! His name is Danglers! A few months later, I visited this house again. And I will tell you, at the exact moment. Remember my brother! The baby was lying in chambray diapers. I decorated the letters that were embroidered! these letters? Show me this place. I tried to educate you. I hired the best teachers. But smuggling was not interested. He was fed up with the sea. He was interested in apartment robberies. He grew up like a child prodigy. Adult criminals fawned over him. He ran away from you. Instead, I am his. If I hadn't killed your father, he would have suffered from it too. This is something new in education. But unfortunately, your father is alive and well. He is a royal prosecutor and lives in Paris. Alive? Alive, the viper! Count, give me 2 weeks. Count, give me 2 weeks! I have to find him! I give you 2 weeks, but... You will go to Italy, find Luigi Vampa.. Your student is under your supervision. Bendetto should arrive in Paris in 2 weeks. And then everything will be as it should be, even if it's the other way around. Yea! He'll be here in 2 weeks. He'll be here in 2 weeks. Why are you mad, Albert? What kind of duel with a friend? Beauchamp is my enemy, not a friend. Admire what is written in your journal about my father. Is your father Fernand Mondego? Did he fight alongside the Turks? This is a slander, he served the famous Ali-Tebelin. Who hides under the name of Fernand Mondego? -Mr Beauchamp! - Hello friends. The note passed me strangely. I knew absolutely nothing about it. - Mr Bauchan! - I'm busy. Lord of Morserf, I accept your challenge and ready to fight you in 2 weeks. But his father is not mentioned in this article and in Paris they don't know that he and Fernand Mondego are one person. If it weren't for your defiance, I wouldn't have known this. Who wants to throw mud at him? This is the main issue. Who! For that, I ask for 2 weeks. I must conduct a thorough investigation. You will post a rebuttal. Yes, if I can be sure the message was fake. Maybe we can declare a temporary truce and will we be friends? Besides, tomorrow we'll be at the Count of Monte-Cristo. Sorry, gentlemen, I have an interview. - Beauchamp, where is Rene? - I don't know that. Yet here it is, running like the wind. - Good afternoon sirs. - And ladies! This is my friend, Captain Maximilian Morrel. I once met a worthy man with that last name. However, enjoy yourselves, gentlemen. Please go to the garden. Maximilian is also a wonderful person. I am very happy that the leading man in Paris, Monsieur de Villefort even visited me that same day. Count, why do you want this haunted house? Ma'am, I have a fondness for ghosts. And they come to me. Count of Morcerf! stop! God, what's wrong with you?! It's this sun. Count, you saved our son's life. We owe you eternal gratitude. Do us the honor, Count, we would like to see you in our house, to thank you for saving our son. Say any night that is convenient for you. Unfortunately, ma'am, I've long since given up on dinner. It could be lunch. I've been used to having lunch alone for many years. Well, what about breakfast? My breakfast is served so early... I think it unlikely ma'am. I really have no luck. There is such a sweet Arab custom. Those who have tasted bread under one roof are friends forever. In our time, eternal friendship does not exist. Just like love. We're friends, aren't we? Why aren't we friends? I hope you are friends too. I dare not claim your friendship. But anyway, I'm your humble servant. Mr Danglars with his wife and daughter! Why does he need this house? I don't know if metaphysics is here, but a lot of money was invested here. Glad to see you, Mr Danglars. Hope lovely ladies like it here, especially for you, Baroness. Lose the garden. Gentlemen! I prepared a surprise for you. Try this Japanese fish. My cook has special authorization for its preparation and studied it for 20 years. Gentlemen! I ask everyone to help themselves. This fish has the property has a mild narcotic effect. The fact is, if this fish gets momentarily bigger or a less secure moment over fire then it becomes poisonous kills whoever eats it faster than the famous curare Faster than water! I have tasted this fish before you and, as you see, I am alive. I beg. And now, gentlemen, I want to entertain you. To do this, I invited my friends - Italian actors. They will show us an outline. I really love pantomimes with a secret meaning. I wonder what the owner of the house meant saying that a pantomime with a secret meaning? What is the secret meaning? Just an ordinary murder. You, Franz, always have some dark thoughts. I've? It seems to me that you are thirsty for blood. Gentlemen! Lord of Villefort, Lord of Morcerf, Lord Danglars. I need to make a statement. I left this part of the garden neglected. on purpose. A crime has been committed here. I discovered in this place bones of a baby buried alive. Taking advantage of the presence of Monsieur de Villefort, I demand that my statement be certified. What does France do with infanticide? They are simply executed. We need to talk. When? Tomorrow in my office, this is the safest place. Buy all the Spanish papers on the stock exchange tomorrow. I have been informed that Dom Carlos is returning to Spain and bonds will go up more than 200%. My predictions were wrong. Don Carlos returns to Spain. Are you sure? I have reliable sources. So, you need to buy Spanish papers. Don't close your bedroom door today. God, be quiet. Do you understand me, Count? Then move on. 10 million! Half our money. He probably wants to ruin you. No way! Invest all the money in Spanish papers. - But we don't have enough! - You will find! I know where this count got millions from. He's a player! Player! On the stock exchange. But now his letter is a little! If nowadays Monte-Cristo is going to demand another 10 million, our bank will go up in the air. Hell, two! He won't have time to buy a Spanish and be afraid to take money. I'm concerned about the reliability of information about Don Carlos. This is as true as the fact that in the ear of one of the Baroness' horses there was a diamond the size of a chicken egg. Who doesn't risk doesn't have. Go ahead, gentlemen! Write. Mrs Danglers. Ask. Ma'am, I must say something important. Gather all your courage. They didn't find any remains there. What do you mean? The Count of Monte Cristo could not find the skeleton of a child there. Because? Because he wasn't there. I was bleeding. My killer, thinking I'm dead, started digging the box, decide that this is a treasure. Despite the weakness, I heard the cry of a child. Looking back hard, I saw the villain running, taking out the box. Was my son alive? Did you buried my son alive? You weren't sure if he was dead and you buried him? We are equally responsible for this. Our son is alive. Someone knows this. Someone has this terrible secret. Since the Count of Monte Cristo speaks of an unearthed child, means he knows this secret. fair God! This is some kind of revenge. Who will tell me now where my son is? I want to calm you down. In less than a week, I'll know all about him. Where does this Count of Monte Cristo come from, what does he need all this for? And why is he talking about non-existent babies? Our Roman is coming! Bertuccio, why are you covered in blood? Everything went well both in Rome and on the way. But just before Paris, he fled. What's the matter, Bertuccio? Bendetto. What did your talented student do? He decided to rob her mansion in Paris. Well, the boy received some kind of education. He tried to persuade me, well, like before. I tried to tie. I see the result in his face. Very artistic work. But we won't find it now. And the damned Villefort has again escaped revenge! I'm not taking revenge on anyone. I'm just helping Providence restore justice. And you will be convinced of it, as soon as your student comes to us. Batisten, remove all security from the mansion in Paris. This is dangerous. I won't let you in alone. I'll go with you. No, I will be alone. I don't want to risk you, my friends. This is the weakest point in my plans. The accounts of him are very vague and contradictory. I don't want to hold your attention insignificant information, I will tell you only the most interesting ones. The main thing we were told is that Monte Cristo is the name of the island, not the surname. According to one source, he is a Lutheran, in others - a Muslim. By the merits which he rendered to the Eastern Christians, The Pope made him a Knight of the Order of Christ. What do you personally think of all this? He somehow controls our actions and it is he who influences the terrible events, that are taking place today in Paris. It is not good, sir, to hit your teacher on the head. Stop son! Stop son! Raise your hands, son! Wait, damn doll! Stand up, daddy. Son! Puppy! Hold him! Bertuccio, what did the bastard do to you?! Stinky dogs! I hate you all! It's about an inveterate criminal who killed my butler. I ask you to personally lead this case. We will severely punish the criminal. You cannot doubt it. Catastrophe! Don Carlos' report is false! Oh, Debray, you bastard! Oh, you scoundrel! He will pay for it. Gentlemen! I hand the paper to Lord Baron Danglars of the Lord Count of Monte Cristo. In it he immediately asks to give the bearer of these 10 million francs. The Count's signature is certified by a notary, which also guarantees my identity. I am a legal entity, with witnesses I confirm that everything is happening strictly in accordance with the law. I have no reason not to trust you. I will issue the requested amount immediately. I ask you to. I'll leave you for a few minutes. I will give an order to the store to take the required amount. Stop! Stop! Welcome. Help me in! - What are you doing here? - What about you? I'm going to the waters, being treated, I got sick. I feel bad too. What a pleasant surprise. What is the problem? We have a trip to Rome. Another move or word and you will become a sieve. Resistance is useless. Relax, the road to Rome is long. - Are you bandits? - No. We serve a very powerful person. I know who you serve. You are serving the Count of Monte-Cristo. No, Edmond Dantès. Give me something to eat. Why are you torturing me? I have a sick liver! We are not thieves, we only trade chickens. However, if you're really hungry, you can buy chicken. It's true, for 1 million francs. Daddy, for only a million. Baron, this is very cheap. Also, this is your daughter's dowry - my fiance Damn you! Peter, count the money. Boss, there are no millions here. How much is there? Almost 50 thousand. In that case, we just leave. Horses for the boss! Eat your wedding cake without us. But I have nothing else! Dad, what's Mom's favorite diamond? choke! Chicken sold for 1 million francs! What do you think of "Hamlet"? My favorite scene is the mousetrap. Defendant, your name, surname? I do not know. Judge Lord! The behavior of this hardened criminal indicates contempt of court. Dad! Why should I respect you? Why did you call M. de Villefort "Pope"? I will tell you now. He says I don't respect the court. Why should I respect you? So why should I respect you? See who's at the head of this courtroom. I, poor abandoned child, forced to make a statement. Please wait with your order. if you refuse answer a question about your name, so answer, what do you have to do to the Count of Monte Cristo? I didn't care about him, maybe I'm the earl himself! Who knows?! And who is this count? With who? Dad. Attorney, I refuse to defend this... And I refuse a lawyer! Accused, are you in your sanity? If Villefort is your father, who is your mother? I think I can guess. You'll finally say your last name, first name and where were you born? I will remind you, father. I was born in an old house in Auteuil. On the 2nd floor in a room with golden angels. Do you remember, father? To remember! I see, I remember. My daddy took me by the hand told my mother I was dead. Look what's happening to him! He is dying! Wrapped in a diaper a sample of which I present to the court. And he took him into the garden near the house, and buried! Into the Chao! Alive! And I wish I could dig! If it wasn't for my teacher, that 2 days ago I filmed on the Champs Elysees. I ask the court to honor his memory by standing up. Stand! That's all I wanted to say. My son! Son! And now Mom has appeared! And here's my little sister! The Sagrada Familia is reunited! It's a pity that only Daddy is dying! Poured with a water, with a hand a swamp The field where the dream of gold grows, For the lapels are worn, moaned, cherished The fruit of your sin seemed to us from a fairy tale And here is the connection of the Dream with the fruit of the plant, Gives an incredible harvest of sin, Weather conditions, appearance and class He won't be harmed for sure. The girl goes down the hall, The sage told her the truth: Ripe cucumber in the field. Let's be a sweet cucumber Split up Sin is the beginning, truth is the end. Ah, you sinned well and small tasks Create for yourself an economic comfort, After all, Rotozeans here and there look, walk and run, They will mature, they will fall into our hands. Yes, sin is just to blame What we call sin, So there's no sin, I don't give a fuck And not to regret So It's time to share everything For those who want to command everyone, And therefore it is necessary to water the Field. Count, Monsieur d'Artagnac. What am I obligated to this visit? After all, our business relationship is over. The point is that Monsieur de Villefort was hit. He is dying, his days are numbered. Second. - What did you say? -Go ahead. He asked to ask you, Mr Monte-Cristo, who you really are. Well, the dying man's will must be done. Tell him, that Edmond Dantès forgives everything. Lord of Morcerf, recognizes this lady as the daughter of Ali-Tebelin, Janina's paxa? Do not. It is a plot hatched by my enemies. Don't you recognize me? But I know who you are! You are Fernand Mondego, a French officer. He trained my father's troops and betrayed him! Vasiliki, my love! My daughter Go for a walk in the garden. The light of my eyes. We're glad to see you, Fernand. Peace be with you, my friend. you killed my father and my mother before my eyes! And I was sold to El-Kobbir as a slave! There! This is the slave trader El-Kobbir. And now I present to you my birth certificate, written and signed by my father. So Ali-Tebelin's daughter actually told the truth. You are to blame for all her family's problems! Well, what is it, Beauchamp? Albert, you and the lady of Morcerf will have to gather all their courage. He recognized everything. - Who? - Your father. He betrayed the fortress of the Pasha of Janina in exchange for money received from the Turks. There was a painful impression of denial from him, until the daughter of Ali-Tebelin spoke, that he sold her into slavery. - Was her name Haydée? - Haydee. Monte-Cristo bought it on the slave market. Just an unfair prejudice that formerly held children responsible for their parents' actions. You need to calm down, Albert. We can't help but answer for our parents. Any of your crimes lives in us. Poison our mind and soul, so the only thing left for me is is to find a second. - One more duel! - Yea. Morser, I'm tired of you. How much time ?! The second challenge in a week. And the last one, because the Count is going to kill me. It hurts a lot, father. Is this really true? Is it true what they say about you? My conscience is clear. If I did something, so only in your mother's name. I would call the scoundrel, destroying our lives, for a duel. But I don't know who he is. And I couldn't do that, because I'm a couple from France. Then I will. His attacker is the Count of Monte-Cristo. Son! You must save Albert's life. Destroy the Count of Monte-Cristo. Good night, Lord of Morcerf. I didn't come to exchange pleasantries. I came to demand an explanation. No, wait? We will! I have to tell the Lord of Morcerf that his father is a scoundrel. No need, Haydee. Enter the house, there we will find out. I want to avenge my father. Lord of Morcerf, you speak too loudly. You need to go out and calm down. You have to get out of here alone. Let me give you some advice. It is impolite to accompany the challenge with noise. Albert! Consider that you dropped this glove. I'll return it along with the bullet. Now get out of here, otherwise I'll call the servants and they'll kick you out. Albert, the challenge has already been made. You are losing your mind. My apologies. Not worth it. I am recently in Paris. I have no friends here. Therefore, I have difficulty with a second. I understand. I can recommend you a second. This is an honest man, Maximilian Morrel. He is not the son of shipowner Morrel, who lived in the 1920s in Marseille? Yes Yes I agree Lady! The Count does not accept. Lady! Don't accept, the Count. Count! - Count! - What's the problem? A woman is coming for you. Who let her come? It's impossible to stop her, she's crazy. She get out of here. What do you want ma'am? Edmond! What name did you pronounce, lady of Morcerf? Your. I said her name, that maybe only I remember. Lady of Morcerf is not here, Mercedes came to you. Mercedes is dead. Do not. Mercedes is alive. She's the only one who remembers you. She's the only one who recognized you. I didn't need to search where the blow that wounded Fernand came from. I'm begging you! Have mercy on my son. It wasn't me who hit Fernand. Providence punishes him. Perhaps you are providence. If you will continue your revenge, so take revenge on me alone. I'm the only one to blame. I didn't have the strength to bear the loneliness. You didn't break the news to me. I didn't know where you were, what happened to you. They said you died. I spent 14 years in a terrible prison, where there was no way out. Stop! Edmond! I always carry this letter with me. It was written by her husband and it was dictated by my friend. Now I'm giving it to you. Goodbye. Edmond! Edmond! Excuse. Excuse me. If only you knew, how many prayers I offered to God for you, when I hoped you were alive. And since I believed you were dead. Will you be my son's killer? I have no other choice, ma'am. Then fate decreed. Fate decreed quite differently. You know my son is like you, like two drops of water, that I gave birth to myself Edmond Dantès? My only lover. The most beautiful person on earth. - This doesn `t happen. - That happens. No one in the world loved more than I did. So you have to choose between the old Edmond Dantès and his younger version. What do you choose? One of us must die. And you must give a name, ma'am. Speak! Edmond Dantès or Albert de Morcerf? Let Albert die. What? No! No! No! Long live both! Kill me, but live both! Calm down, lady. Your child will live. The dead will return to the tomb. No! No! No! Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye forever Descend to the shores of your dreams, Forgive me, everything that happened, forget it, and go, But forget about love. Don't promise, don't promise. Goodbye! Let the sadness go The ship is sailing Just a pity for him That in the distance you can see the coast of the homeland, swim in the distance But don't forget your sadness your sadness Goodbye! Forgive me, Haydée. Verified weapons. But the Lord of Morcerf is late. Report to Monte Cristo that the lord of Morcerf has arrived. Albert! On here! We're already worried. I have two words to say to the Count. What more do you want from me? Gentlemen, I want everyone to hear this. Make no mistake, young man. Don't tempt fate with another insult. Otherwise, the dead may not be killed. I apologize for the insult the fisherman Fernand inflicted on you. You had the right to take revenge on my father. Count! If you think this is possible, I ask for your hand. Is it true that I look like Edmond Dantès? Yes it's true. - So you're my father? - No, Albert. To me, this similarity is striking. I would like to be like you, not just on the outside. There is no need to repeat someone else's path. Live your life. I wish you happiness. Albert, I admire you! In recent days, Paris is full of sensations. He is still my father and your husband. Are we committing treason? Third. Here, son, this is our home. Dad! Why do you have a gun in your hands? Maximilian. You are a man of honor. I will explain everything now. You will understand me. Years ago I received a deferral of accounts, which unfortunately ends today. My business hasn't improved. Well. And I, like my snow-white frigate "Pharaoh", I must disappear. Only blood washes away dishonor. Hang on! Who are you? Representative of the House of Thomson & French. All of Lord Morrel's bills have been paid. But I have an arrest warrant against Lord Morrel. arrest an innocent person. Once you've already made a mistake, arresting an innocent. Follow me! Dad! Are you Miss Julie Morrel? Yes sir. What you want? I do not know you I am the representative of House Thomson & French. I am authorized to deliver this for Lord Morrel. Dad, the debts have been paid and here's a document stating that the loan has been paid to the bank. I recognized this wallet. My sons, I know the name of the savior. My son! Evil cannot be defeated, because the fight against him is life. You are not light, fate is not fate, A wall without a window, a crowd without fire, Without having lived a day, Without having lived a day Right on the left is the helm, I speak the truth, I lie, There's no wind for the sails, I don't believe in myself, But you have to lie to yourself Need to swim under the waves My fragile boat is not full of fishing, Left to fate is my boat. On the right, on the left is the helm, I'm telling the truth, I'm lying. There is no wind for the sails. I don't believe in miracles! Words of miracles, miracles of words Bird feathers in paradise As if a forest was melting and everything was losing weight, Everything you don't believe in yourself In such a way can save us Only love can save everyone If you believe it again! The wind of hope keeps the sail at dawn And you're twenty years younger A primeval star shines as before in the sky That Venus has always been called! What has always been called love! Lord thank you for giving me the opportunity to love again The wind of hope keeps the sail at dawn And you're twenty years younger A primeval star shines as before in the sky That Venus has always been called! This love was always called
