Now it's all in the past. Our era is ending. Maybe it's for the best. We'd like to start the press conference. We'll start with a statement by Director Hayao Miyazaki. Just one comment. I've caused a stir before by saying I'm quitting. So people don't believe me. But... this time... I mean it. I try to stay in shape and go easy, but it's getting harder to concentrate. It's a physical fact. Old age brings problems. It can't be helped. I've always done my best, so I have no regrets. I believe I've always pushed myself to the limit. I've never looked back. My era of feature-length films is clearly over. I've decided to treat any desire to continue as the delusions of an old man. I'm coming. Why the camera? Pardon my intrusion. I'm retired, now. Lots of snow, eh? Lots of funerals too, lately. I hate it. They were all younger than me. Hope this coffee's not too strong for you. Thank you. I've stopped accommodating others. That song Let It Go is popular now. It's all about being yourself. But that's terrible. Self-satisfied people are boring. We have to push hard and surpass ourselves. - It's time to work. - Please do. Don't mind me. No need to film. I'm just doodling something for display at the museum. I'm a retired old geezer. A pensioner. If I concentrate like I once did, I suddenly get exhausted. I just fool around, now. Want some tea? I've got things I want to do, but don't feel I can. I want to create something extraordinary. liust don't know if I can do it. Hey, birdie! Want some food? This won't do... How about chocolate? Studio Ghibli was founded for Hayao. His ability to keep going is crucial. So now... If Hayao quits, it's meaningless to have a production team. I explained that clearly to the staff, and they understood. So the production team was put on hiatus, or really, disbanded. Ghibli films are almost all hand-drawn. But the world's changing. We can't stop CGI from taking over animated films. It's important to draw full human beings. You're drawing people, not characters. I'm counting on you. No, no, no. Bundles like this are cradled in the arm. People don't let them hang down. That never happens. No one runs that way, either. They'd at least put a hand down. No good. Start over. Draw it.Think it through. Do you live without thinking? Do it or you're out! Quit now! I think it's really over. I trained successors. But I couldn't let go. I devoured them. l devoured their talent. There was no one left to take over. The studio devours people. That was my destiny. late them all. I don't regret shutting the studio down. You should come here every day. It would keep you young. - I'm not supposed to drive. - What? My doctor says no more than an hour. It's so limiting. It's like all we can do now is get old. - That's right. - That's it. The question is, how will we end? That's the hard thing. Hello! Nice to see you again. Whew! I'm worn out. Ishii's production company recently showed me some CGI animation. Interesting people. Really young! Why'd you meet them? I'll use CGI to make a short film. 06‚Äù? That's surprising! So you think CGl's offers new possibilities? No, that's not it. I have ideas that I can't draw by myself. This might be a way to do it. That's all I hope. It's a new genre, this technology. So there's lots of vitality. He wants to keep creating until he dies. He said he was retiring, but... That just applies to feature films. He wants to do shorts. There's one project left. It's called Boro the Caterpillar. Until he finishes that, he feels incomplete. This is Boro. This project's so difficult I don't know where to start. I can't draw a caterpillar with a pencil. So I have to turn to CGI. Good morning! Good morning! Shall we start? This is our second session. Yuhei's in charge of the characters. Let's just show him. First, Boro walking. Mmm. Interesting. You didn't do this by hand, right? No, as far as the hair's concerned, it was all done mathematically. It reflects how hair moves in nature. The computer calculates it. It accounts for air resistance. You can set how strong the wind blows... This hump... should start here and flow back. I'd like that feeling to be clearer. Caterpillars really move that way. I'd like that emphasized. And the head shouldn't move so much. Watch the head and front legs... If those legs start to grab something, it'll look completely different. l was going to do that. Oh, really? I think we've got something here. Thank you.You've given me a lot to think about today. I think CGI might work, but I have to clarify the concept. - People are the key. - That's for sure. You have to have the right people. So do you think they're suitable? Yes, I think they're good. A chance encounter... Funny how that works. Well... Well... There's no escape, now! New technology makes it possible. So I'm going to try it. I don't expect much to come of it. It's exciting to see you take on a new challenge! I don't like the word "challenge." 0h? I just trudge along. Forward, always forward... Good morning! You start your new project today. Yes, we start today. But at my age, it's tough to start work again. This'll be my desk. It's all dusty. This is past its season. Just looking isn't enough. I have to look while imagining Boro climbing on it. Then I might get somewhere. I blame Boro for living in such a bothersome place. So interesting... What should I look at? I just sketch anything that catches my attention. Fortunately, Yuhei and his staff come in later. I'll draw something that'll make them want to quit! Since we're doing CGI, I want to push them to the limits of what CGI can do. No good. Mmm. Who started this stupid project? I'm not making a story, yet. That's too limiting. I'm just sketching what might go in. I wish I could draw that plain background. The one you just looked at? Yeah. Nothing special. Something everyone's seen. That's hard to do? My backgrounds were usually contrived. But now I'm attracted to throw-away backgrounds. Maybe it's my age... Hello? Mmm. Oh, I see. Nothing else has been decided? Okay. I understand. She passed away. Fifty years. Actually 52 years, we worked together. She was sure she'd live to 93, but fell short by 20 years. Nothing to be done. But I can't help wonder why I wasn't taken first. What to make of it? People are dying who should have outlived me. What am I doing here? Hello! Sorry I'm late. This here is your problem area. It's like a black box, isn't it? If you boiled my shoulder, it wouldn't make a broth. Just inky black water. Sherlock Holmes would know. He'd say, "You're an animator." But what do I do with the time I have left? I'm a weak, used-up old man. It'd be ridiculous to think I'll ever regain my youth. - Ah, welcome! - Good morning! We're ready. This is Yuhei. And... This is Yukinori. Nice to meet you. You're all so elite, it makes me nervous! Let's ease into it. What's this? Beams of light. Wow! I'll explain the basic storyline. I'm thinking 100 shots in 10 minutes. A blue dawn before sunrise. Sparkling air cubes dance down. One hits a stem where Boro lives and shatters. There's no sound, no weight-- it's air. A crystallized fragment hits an egg stuck on the stalk. The egg cracks open, and eyes peer out. That's the birth of Boro. Once we start, it shouldn't take long. There aren't many characters. Once we get that, it'll be fast. I'd... ...like to experiment with the caterpillar a little. Fascinating. Maybe my meddling will ruin it! Here's the top view, and the side view. The eyes go here. Keep going. I've added fingers. I thought fingers would give you more dramatic options. Yeah. Give it a try. It's so strange. Like creating a new virus. Hayao likes young people. They energize him. But what happens to the young people? Working with him ages them. Hayao himself, well... he absorbs youthful energy and gets revitalized. He'll do that as long as he lives. I'd like to show you something. It's still very rough, but... Here... I'd like to see this go higher, like this. It starts here, and bulges up, then down. Make the top point clearer. Can I use this to draw? The hump starts here... and ripples up... to a peak. It's okay for it to be generated quickly. Then ripple up to a clear peak. Now, about the feet... How about this? Can they go this way? Ah, we can do that. They should look busy. Let's go a little deeper. Keep at it! That's all. Thank you. No, don't thank me. I should thank you. It feels like we're making a film. I'm excited! My heart's racing. Pitter-pat, pitter-pat! I have to draw on paper to understand. Excuse me. The onion's waiting, see? You're making ramen? Things are not going well. How do we move forward? That's the question. Well... It'll work out somehow. l have to show them a layout. There. I think that CGI animators focus on external movement but ignore motivation. Movement isn't neutral. It has intent. That's what makes muscles move. Oh, no! I can't stop myself! This is amazing! With this much detail, we can't ignore it. That's for sure. I'm sure he's trying to help us. That's why he made such detailed drawings. Might be faster to draw by hand... You're 100 times more energetic than last year. Don't be silly. I'm not healthy at all. No, I'm sure of it. That look in your eyes... I'll have to work my whole life! I'm sure you're energetic. - Work keeps you going. - Don't say that! Your eyes burn with purpose! I qualify as an old, old man. Near the end of my life! - Who says so? - I do. Call it my final gasp! - It's so quiet. -Yeah. How many times have I done this? Here. The site of photosynthesis. It needs something more. Maybe a little hair... I recently read a book that really shook me up. I questioned my decision to retire. You had an intense encounter with a book? Yeah. I read it avidly many times. It showed me a different way to interpret and portray the world. I thought, I still have something. Like doing another feature film? No, that's different. That's not so easy to do. If it were, I'd still work. My physical and mental drive are failing. I really feel it. Well... It's best for me to recognize that. - Oh? - Yes, it's true. I went for my driving review test and stood in line with lots of people my age. I realized I'm really a geezer! Here. See? This is how they looked. It was shocking. An old man shocked by old men. -Yes? - May I show you something? What is it? We added some movement. The turning motion's too adult-like. Imean... Babies don't turn their heads so sharply. More like this, right? Newborns aren't so nimble. How can I explain...? Basically, babies are clueless. It's all a matter of culture. So difficult! It doesn't bring my layout to life. No... I don't know why. I did such a detailed layout because I don't trust them. But I want them to create something even better. What Hayao wants is a copy of himself. But he can't expect that. He said it many times: "I want another me." CGI is difficult. It's no magic box. This could really be awful. I realized that today. Maybe I should shut it down. All my work over decades could be for nothing. But how hard should I fight? I set this battle up myself. But... we've had no bloodshed... yet! Ifeel like all of my effort's been for nothing. This isn't it... What a hassle! Ah, such a hassle! A real hassle! I must battle my desire to avoid a hassle. All important things in the world are a hassle. I don't want to embarrass myself. That much I know for sure. - Good morning! - Ah, good morning! ls Toshio free after this? You need to see him? Please wait just a moment... He'd like to talk to you. - OK? -Yes. Come in. I've been watching the animators work for a while, now. I think we have to change course. I was afraid of that. I don't know how to do it, but... They should do a more finished first scene. Trial and error. It's such a hassle. A real hassle! - Not going according to plan... - No. It's never-ending! - it can't be helped. - Should we quit? That might be best. That's how you feel, huh? I can't show this to the public. Can you get what you need from your staff? I don't know. I can't sleep! May I have your attention? I have something to say. Gather around. Could you bring chairs? We have to make something we're proud of. A film that'll amaze people. Really. So, we'll try it this way. Hmm.This'll be hard. Can I see the first scene? Click here. Touch this to move it. I see. Is this a good size for you? Ah, too much trouble! I'll stop for now. See how the hair sticks out? It's charming, but too small to see. So... we extend it... or maybe like this... Springing out? Boing, boing, boing. We've got to start over and get through somehow. It's a film-- we can't abandon it. I'd hate to complain about CGI the rest of my life. I want to get to a place where I'm glad we did this. Give it expression... I reached for paper! Huh? What...? Eraser. I wanted the eraser. Huh? It moves! Fascinating! Hey! They're multiplying! I'm pretty sure I'll never get the hang of this. I just thought there was a problem. Okay, then. All yours. Okay? Mt. Fuji's hidden in clouds. Unless I show them how I want it done, l have no cause to be angry, do I? I took this ordeal upon myself, after all. Ordeal? It's an ordeal. A huge one. This one's the hardest. It has to be right. It starts the film. l have to add a lot to the CGI, with a pencil. We start with the CGI, and I overlay it with hand drawing. Otherwise, I don't get the right image. I wonder if this is the right approach. But I don't know any other way. This is hard. And mortifying. I don't know what to do. It's terrible. It's terrible, and I don't know why. He's distressed that his magic power isn't working. This might mean true retirement. That's why he's agonizing. A slow day today? Some were out late last night. And some went to the Star Wars screening. It's nice and quiet. Our world here is entirely different from Star Wars. They'll all be bowled over and want to do Star Wars, not a caterpillar. What!? When I'm tired, my pencil escapes. Come back here! Let's have some coffee. I can't get excited like I did in my 30s and 405. Something's different. So what motivates you? It's boring to do nothing. It's as simple as that. I'm not being nihilistic. All old directors say they'd rather make films than do anything else. But... I don't want to make crap. I want to go somewhere new. For me, it's not about the story. One shot tells me whether a film's great or not. That's the essence of film. Look at the goats! So cute! I finally solved it. The puzzle. There's no sign of other creatures. Let's add some. Let's put in "night fish." These, moving weirdly. What do you think? I hog all the interesting things. Let's break out of this! We've been constipated too long! All right, now! Let's do it! Once a film's been completed, it's crucial that I don't feel ashamed of it. I never want to regret not trying something. It's better to try and fail. I believe that. I really do. I don't want people to see they're fish. They should be mysterious. My films show the world's beauty. Beauty otherwise unnoticed. That's what I want to see. The small fish suddenly scatter. Will that work? Ah, the frogs are croaking. They're croaking despite the cold. It's tadpole season. It's going well, don't you think? Yes, indeed. It'll be all right. What a bustling world! Full of strange wonder. No one will notice that Boro's hair is moving. Except young kids. I've certainly never seen anything like it before! It's not over. The question is, what's best for these times? There must be something people yearn to see. What is it? Are you thinking about a feature film? Well... It would be great if I could, but I wouldn't make it through. It's not easy to make a feature film. One shouldn't undertake it lightly, just for fun. It's a hard road. I can't leave people in the lurch. What if I have a heart attack? Really. I've never thought I'd make lots of films. Just making one is something to be grateful for. I've been blessed in many ways. My wife told me I've been really lucky. And it's true. We never thought our films would be popular. We accepted that. We just made what we wanted. But that's why we survived. I see that in hindsight. If we'd tried to please, we'd be long forgotten. Good morning! Wait-- I'll make some coffee. We've just been talking informally about it... So what's this about? Our company's been quietly researching CGI. There's something called "deep learning" in Al. We think that computers will be able to paint like humans five to ten years from now. If they do that, we won't need humans. I'll meet them in the conference room. I didn't expect so many! - It grew. - I expected three! It just grew. You'll show us on that? Yes. Shall we start? Lots of places have started using Al for image processing. We'd like to show you what we do. We taught the program to speed up the image. It uses the head to move. No sense of pain, no idea that the head is important. It uses the head as if it were just an ordinary leg. It's creepy, and might be good in a zombie game. Using artificial intelligence enables a kind of horror beyond human imagination. That's what we're doing. Let me just say... Every morning, I used to see a friend who's disabled. He would walk up to me. One leg's turned outward, so it's hard for him to walk. Even a high-five is hard for him. His stiff hand and mine touch. I think of him, and can't say I like this. Whoever made it gives no thought to pain. It's very unpleasant. You can make horrible things if you want, but I want nothing to do with it. It's an awful insult to life. This is all experimental. I understand that. It's not something we'd show publicly. I understand completely. What's your ultimate goal? A machine that draws pictures like people do. Yes. I fear the world's end is near. Humans have lost confidence. Hand drawing's the only answer. I won't run from it anymore. It takes tremendous patience. It's a lot of work. Really exhausting. What have I done? Pretty creepy. Amazing! Good morning! - He's still with us! - Sorry! Even in secret talks. Shall we do it? What? - A feature film. -Well... It would have to be a frontal attack. I would all be hand-drawn. -Who would do it? -We'd gather the staff. And recruit new people. There aren't any new people. It's decided, then. I wrote something up. Just three years. That's all we have. Done before the Olympics. So 2019. If we start right now, that's half a year. Use whatever alchemy you need to raise the money. But imagine this: you die right after finishing the storyboards. That would be a big hit! What? I have to die? Without seeing it done. Being the work of a retiree, it'll have to feel like it had to be made. I insisted no more was needed, after all. I don't know, but it'll be something new. A place I'd never been before. What kind of place? Can you describe it? I don't know. It won't go into words, yet. But it'll touch new territory. It'll be a troublesome old age! Hey there! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Have some. Two today! Two? Okay, go ahead. Green. All right. Thank you! I'll open it. You have to push. Thank you! Did you hear that Michiyo died? Dropped dead, suddenly. After starting chemo, she suffered a lot. She always said I should do another film. I said, "I will if you will." She didn't answer. But she didn't say no! I wanted her help on the basic stuff. It can't be helped. But... I kept saying that all day yesterday. Can't be helped... Does it give you doubts about the new film? It doesn't matter. It's an extremely difficult project. It always is. No need to flinch at every setback. Ah. It's a heavy blow. Are those your new storyboards? Yeah. I'll know if I should continue after I make 100 or so. It's difficult! Difficult. I haven't told my wife. When I do, I'll ask her to understand. I'm prepared to die before it's finished. I'd rather die that way than die while doing nothing. To die with something to live for.
