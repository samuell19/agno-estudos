Yes! Take that. - Again. - Again? - Yes. - Wanna lose again? We'll start with Dolores. We'll do some shots over there on that background, then we shoot the whole family, in different places. But not with Martin, the boy. - Yes. - We agreed that he wouldn't take part. Both ourselves and Dolores are at your disposal. Okay. Help yourself to a bite. Thanks, you didn't have to. Tell the others to help themselves. - Rochi... her natural color, right? - Yes, of course. - Whenever you are ready. - Yes. You're doing good. That's it! There, right there. Relax your shoulders. Can the parents join in? Good. - Here? - Yes. - That's it. - A big smile! That's it! Relaxed. Good. Resuming a few activities has helped me a lot. Leaving the house. The unconditional support from my family and friends that gives me strength and makes me feel better. Thanks to them I started talking again. I think that's the key. They are everything. Now that you mention friendship. Which 3 words would define the relationship you had with Camila? Friendship. Loyalty. Fun. However, what Camila did wasn't precisely out of loyalty... How did you feel when you found out she shared the infamous video? Well, I've explained that many times... what she did was unfortunate, and it upset me a lot at the time. But it's in the past. I was able to forgive her and it was as if it had never happened. Sandra, can we not talk about the video? Like we'd agreed... Yes, of course. I apologize. Dolores... You mentioned your friends and family. Tell me more about the support they provide for you. My family and I are like a team. My dad is... very efficient in handling all of this. And my mom is very... caring, and close to me. Dolores? I don't know what I'd do without my family. It showed up over there. Crawled all the way through the ceiling. And went out that way. Yeah, but those animals are harmless. - Sure, but it really startled me. - I can imagine. Do we know where it will take place? That's decided by the court only a few days before. The court has already confirmed the starting date for the oral trial. Dolores is confident of justice, and impatient... We will not be answering any further questions. Have a good day. Murderer! THE ACCUSED Goodnight. Goodnight, sweetie. Mortal Kombat, I'll see you manana! Kitana, Kitana, Kitana Mortal Kombat, I'll see you manana! Princess Nokia, you can call me on my cellular I don't know, it won't load. But he's Largo's cousin, he's really hot. You find all guys hot, Flo. No, I promise this one is hot. Know how long since I last got laid? Are you kidding? Two years. And 3 ha“. Damn. You closed shop for good! What's up, Betty? How are you? Need help? No thanks, it's okay. It relaxes me. Betty. - What? - Can you give us the password? What for? I wanna show Dolores a video and it's not loading. What video? Sia, an Australian singer. She's amazing. "ACAPULC001", all caps. But just for a while. I'll change it later. And don't look anything that might hurt you. Look at him! - Always recording, Largo! - What's wrong? It's coming out great! You're wasting your time, and you'll never get it back. - Ooh. - Whoa... - Ooh. - Whoa... He is such a poet... What's going on? Hello. How are you? Oh, you're here. The magazine is out, I'm outraged. They put her on the cover, we only got a tiny spot, and on the inside, we're second. - Let me see. - I called Rochi to see what happened. We hadn't agreed on this. Look inside. I WILL ALWAYS BE IN PAIN That couch wasn't there... Turn the page, this is pointless. It's never been there. Look at ours. The photos are great. - They look warm and... - She looks very nice. I read it, it's very positive, doesn't say a bad thing, on the contrary. Wait, wait I'm still reading. You think she moved it just for the article? Why do you even care? Come on, let me read. - Dolo... - Dolo! Give me the magazine. Dolores. Leave it, that's enough. Luis... You should've brought it to me, she shouldn't have seen this. - I don't agree. - It's not good for her! Your attitude's not good for her! What's happening with Dolores Dreier? Manipulative murderer or victim of an unjust accusation? MARISA NIEVES: CAMILA'S MOTHER A liar. Every word she says is a lie. Every word she says is a lie. During my daughter's funeral she couldn't look me in the eye, DOLORES DREIER: UNICA IMPUTADA POR EL she didn't say a word. DOLORES DREIER: UNICA IMPUTADA POR EL But I saw it, I saw it in her eyes. She murdered her. I regret having to say it, but she murdered my daughter. - Stop! - I hate you! Stop! Stop! Step. Martin, stop it... Martin! Stop it! What's wrong with you? Dad said I can't have my first communion. Because of you. You'll have your communion. I'll talk with him. He's just a bit worried. You'll have your communion. Do you believe me? Dude, you really beat me up. It'll only be a While. It'll be good for us. Do you really want to step into a church? Can you imagine their looks? My nerves won't take it... But it's the other way around, Lio's dad is right. - Being secluded won't help us. - Lio's dad?! What the hell does he know?! Do you want to take her too? Put her on the spotlight? Have someone yell at her? Can't you see it's good that she's seen at church? With her family, her brother... Just like anyone else! We don't even have to organize a thing. Is that what you worry about? No, but I sometimes remember we also have a son! - And that he has a family! - That's enough, stop arguing. Rochi will surely agree. A perfect occasion to wear the "good girl" outfit she loves. Do whatever you want. Am I the only reasonable person here? When did you get this dense, Luis? 2 years and 3 ha“ ago, to be exact. It was very bright. I realized it was late and got up. And what did you see? Camila sleeping. Cam. You couldn't have seen Cami sleeping because you weren't in the same room. No, of course. “ Woke up, saw the empty room. I went down the hallway and saw Cami asleep on the couch. Come on, you can't hesitate, Dolores. You could tell. She didn't move - or notice that I was there. And didn't it occur to you that she could be dead? I would've see the blood. Don't mention the blood. Just say that you didn't see anything odd. And then what did you do? I realized I was late to pick Martin up from school. I didn't ask what you thought but what you did. You're not concentrated enough, Dolores. Focus. I went to the bathroom, I had to pee. It was late. I had to pick up Martin from school at 12:20 to meet my parents at 2pm and drive to the farm... No, make it shorter. And don't mention at what time you were supposed to leave. So then you left. No. I washed my face. Why? Were you covered in blood? No. I was covered in alcohol. I was filthy. I had a hangover. My shirt was dirty, So I took one of hers and then I left. No, no, don't talk about your clothes. Let them ask you that. But now that you mention it. What did you do with your t-shirt? I put it in the laundry bin. That's odd, why didn't you take it with you? It wasn't odd. Cami and I always shared clothes. And how can you explain... the fact that your shirt never showed up? I have no explanation for it. Unless someone tampered with the crime scene. Why do you say that?: - I don't know. - Don't say that... It sounds too technical. "I swear I left it there". Let's go again. From the beginning. With your own words, as if you told a story. Get ready man, Fatty's coming. What do we tell your mom if you're killed? Don't mess with me. - I don't think she did it. - She absolutely did! - Hi. - Hey. Shall we go? Right now? Wanna cup of coffee first? Two croissants! Coffee and croissants! We'll get you a latte. Good luck. Send us a photo or a video so we believe you! Sure bro, I'll send you three. - Come on. - Hi there. Hi, Luis. How are you? - I'm good. - Good? - Who's this guy? - Lucas, 3 friend of ours. How come I never saw you before? How do you know each other? I live some blocks away. On Olleros and Pereyra St. - Next to the reserve. - He's a friend Luis, seriously. Yeah? And what do you do for a living? I work at the natural reserve. Hi. Hi. Come up. Hey girl. So... Dolores, meet Lucas. Hi. Now you're acquainted. Sit down. Hey girl, your dad got super controlling. His interrogation even freaked me out. Yeah, he goes really far. Look at this guy. Say something! Are you mute? Oh, shut up. - And what about you? - What? You're Largo's cousin, right? Yeah. And how much did you bet? No, it's not like that. So... What should we do? Wait. Here with an eye-witness. Wait, don't change it. A PUMA ON THE LOOSE? Neighbors urge the authorities to act A PUMA ON THE LOOSE? Neighbors urge the authorities to act - That's near my house. - Maybe it'll eat you. - That's near my house. - Maybe it'll eat you. Really! I know that old lady. A PUMA ON THE LOOSE? A PUMA ON THE LOOSE? She has that thing in the head, that makes you forget stuff. It's called Alzheimer's. Yeah, that's the one. Puma. Urban myth... or real threat? ...Two and a half yeears have passed since the murder of Camila Nieves the trial against the sole suspect will begin in 3 weeks. The trial against the sole suspect will begin in 3 weeks. The trial against the sole suspect will begin in 3 weeks. - Dolores Dreier - Shit, change it! These motherfuckers... They just keep making stuff up. Yeah. I think I know that lady too... No one's worked on the farm over a year now... I don't know where she is now. We could try, but I'm not confident she'll go along during a statement. She's not the sharpest tool in the shed... - Martin. - What about Martin? Were you able to discuss...? We agreed that under no circumstance he would be involved. To be honest, well... I'm not sure how he would react under pressure on the stand. He's just a kid, and sometimes he just says whatever... Excuse me, but we agreed that this was not up for discussion. Yes... ut if your daughter's freedom depends on I we need to consider it. Don't you think so? Martin stays out of it, period. Rochi, how's the agenda? After the magazine article everyone wants an interview. Mario Elmo has called me twice. Personally. Unbelievable. What a vulture! The nerve on him! Calling after all his tabloid propaganda against Dolores. I don't think it's personal. In any case, let's relax a little. We've been working on Dolores' body language and we're doing very well. - I'm going to the toilette. - Her diction has improved. Good, anything that improves her public image will help us. Yes. We need to try to prove... And how does it work? Do they just let you out? My mom's waiting for me at a bar nearby. I can technically go anywhere, except leave the country. I need a special permit for that. Anyway, I never go out. My mom takes me out so I don't go crazy. I like crazy ones. What's the deal with that boy? Do you like him? I don't know. What the hell is going on here? Luis. Yes. No, we were at the dentist. We're close by. We'll be there shortly. Ok, bye. What's that lock? If he asks, you were at the dentist. Otherwise, he'll make a scandal. What the hell is going on here? - Sir. Excuse me. - Yes? Do you know what's going on? It's 'cause of the puma... Neighbors organized a hunting party but since they can't find it they blocked the streets they blocked the streedts in protest... But did someone actually see the puma? An old lady says so, but I don't really think so... Well, thanks for your help. Good night. God damn it! I can't believe these people actually think there's a puma. Hello... Hello, how's everyone? - Hello. - Hi, how're you? - Everything well? - Hi, how are you? - How's Lio? - I'm glad you decided to come. Thanks to you. Hello! How are you? Hi, Grace. Did Martin see his little cousin? You hadn't met him yet. Look at how small he is. He's beautiful. I think he needs a diaper change. Wanna come help me get the diaper bag from the car? Or give me the keys then. Or he'll be stinking throughout the entire ceremony! The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth. And the truth will set you free. Truth is the most precious treasure. I believe that's what Jesus is trying to tell us. He... Descended from Heaven and accepted the punishment of his body to give us the truth. So let us not doubt in Jesus' truth. Since it will set us free. THE GIRLS FROM SAMPA You went off with that guy? Well, you won't be doing that anymore. You should thank if we let him come here. It's either that... or nothing. This is your fault. I warned you. Look at the mess you did with your hair. Does Rochi know about this? Not yet. Well, we've got to tell her. We need to stick together. It's almost over. It will all be okay. From now on I want everyone to be completely focused. You... will respect what we agreed and won't go out alone again. - And you... - We got it Luis, we got it. Got it? Got it. That's the worst haircut I've ever seen. You look like a poodle. You're such a pussy. And you're mean. I've been waiting for this for two years. Are you afraid? I want it all to be over. And I'm afraid it's finally over, too. Sometimes I think they should just put me in jail and get it over with. Why do you say that? Why are you here? I like you. I'm not funny, or smart. I don't have a future. Do you get that I'm accused of murdering someone? Did you do it? At last... Do you know how much Ignacio charges per day? Or his partner? Or the idiots that make the photocopies. Do you know how much that cunt Rochi charges? Do you get that there's 40 million people that watch the news every day to know if I'm guilty or innocent? And what do you think? That because you come here and we fuck, I'm gonna tell you? No, idiot. It wasn't me. Why did you cut your hair? Why? Good girls need to have long hair? ...Miss Dolores Inés Dreier, the court requests you to pay full attention to everything that occurs in this debate. Especially to the accusations against you that we will now read. You will then be able to offer a statement of your own. And you may also abstain to do so without that implying any assumption of guilt. Miss Dolores Inés Dreier Who organized the party the night before Camila Nieves was found dead? Camila. Myself... and a few more friends. Berta. Ana, Eli. Several witnesses have declared that you had insisted to your friends that the party should be... ...massive. Can you confirm? It was Cami's farewell party. She was going away on a trip for 3 months, and we knew she was going to stay even longer. So we all wanted it to be a good party. A good party... Yes. Of course. And who's idea was it for the party to be, as you so call it, a "free-range party"? Cami's. Camila's? Camila's. Do you recall who the last guests to leave the party were? Um... From what I was told... Florencia, Ana, and... Eva. Bu“ mm see them. I was asleep. According to the witness Ana Sgrim, your fellows tried to wake you up so you could leave with them. But you did not want to. With what purpose did you decide to stay in the room of the victim, sleeping, alone? I was intoxicated and asleep. I'd stayed the night at Camila's many times. And since the girls didn't find it odd, they just left me sleeping. Nevertheless, Miss Dreier... You had had a very intense fight, not long before. Mister president, I'd ask the prosecutor to state the questions he deems necessary and to leave the assessment to the allegation, please. Thank you. Counselor, please rephrase the question. Miss Dreier, had you stayed the night at Camila's house since your fight with her? No. But I had already forgiven Cami. You had already forgiven her. Could you specify when you had forgiven her? A couple of weeks before. I don't have an exact date. I don't remember. I do remember it was Thursday because I was leaving a class on 20th century fashion and I was very excited, I remember, and we talked about it with Camila. We talked a lot about it. She invited me over for some "mates" so we could make up. We were together until midnight. We talked about what had happened. And... we made up. In fact, it was then that she told me that she wanted the party to be "free range" like... like a gesture towards me. So something like what had happened... wouldn't happen again. No, you were great girl, really. You shut him up real good, the wanker. You can tell a mile off he's a retrograde. Look who it is. Miss Perfect. - Playing innocent. - I'm tired or her. - No, wait. - Flo. Flo, stop it, girl. Hi girls. Everything's good? - Good. - Yeah, good. Hey you, everything good? Good. Well, here we are... So, what are you going to do? You're gonna say you were wrong? That I was wrong? Yeah, that what you said about the maid was bullshit. Of course I won't, it's a statement. I can't just change it whenever I feel. Plus I'm sure when I called Dolo I said dead, not stabbed. That stupid ass maid is the one mistaken. She can't tell what she heard from what she heard on TV. Berta has nothing to do with it, Flo. Yeah she does. Cause if the maid doesn't show up and that statement will end up hurting Dolores. Get it? It will look like Dolores knew Cami was stabbed before anyone told her. Say you don't recall what you said. Dead, murdered, stabbed... - Why do you care? - That would be false statement. Who the fuck cares? You're telling me Dolores should be convicted? You think she's guilty?! Just say it, bitch. You're telling me she's guilty? - Let's go, Flo. - We're not saying that. I think you just want the spotlight, having found the corpse and all that. - Deal with it. - Shut up, you fat fuck! Stop! If Berta could choose, she wouldn't have gone into that apartment. Being in the spotlight? - Not one bit. - What're you saying!? You could've been the unlucky one to be accused of this. In your place, Dolores would be helping you. But I've got an alibi, Flo. Does Dolores have an alibi? - What the fuck do you mean? - Stop, stop. - That's enough, stop. - Come on, let's go. - What's going on here? - Nothing. Let's go, Dolores. - Sorry. - Let's go. You know you cannot talk with the witnesses. I know, I didn't say anything. Let's go, before it gets worse. Fede and Ricu were still there, but I'm not sure at what time that would be exactly. Did you take all of these photographs? Almost all. The camera was mine, but other people also used it. This sequence I'm going through is as it was found stuck on the fridge inside the victim's house. Miss Euler... Why did you take a camera to this party? A "free-range party", as you call it. What you're not allowed to use are cell phones, or stuff that can be uploaded to social media. Polaroid is okay. It's organic. Organic? And tell me, Miss Euler. Who's idea was it for the party to be organized in this way? Dolores'. I couldn't hear you. Dolores'. Dolores Dreier's. Do you recall why you took this photograph? I found it amusing - how she was sleeping. And did you try to wake her up? Yes I called to her various times from the door, but she wouldn't answer. So I took the photo and left with the girls. With all the girls, staying behind only Camila Nieves and Dolores Dreier. Yes. And none of your friends tried to wake her up in a more pressing way, so to speak? Yes, Florencia also tried to wake her up. She said she shook her a bit but Dolores didn't want to wake up. "She didn't want to wake up?" Intriguing phrase. As if to say waking up is a voluntary choice we humans have. As if the accused, who heavily insisted on organizing this party of which she thought, or she knew, there would be no record left, had stayed sober during the whole night and under no circumstance, Mr. President, wanted to leave the house. Mr. President, I don't understand where the prosecutor is going with this. He is confusing the witness, he is confusing all of us. Counselor, please. Do you recall, Miss Euler, having seen the accused drugged and or drunk, during the party in question? No, I don't recall. I think she was drunk. But I'm not completely sure. Thank you very much, Miss Euler. Okay, thank you. Okay, I appreciate it, thank you. Done, it's all been taken care of. He's staying at Graciela's until nighttime. Great. Do we have any Clonazepam left? - I'll bring you some later, okay? - Sure. Remember when you used to give your dad massages? He really liked them. You'd give her five pesos. Yeah. Five pesos... were worth a fortune back then. She didn't have any strength, the massages were terrible. They weren't terrible, he liked them. Yes, she was good at it. Why don't you give him one now? Give him one. A massage for your dad. Look. Poor him. He's all tense, it's been a long day. Uff, he's all stiff. Lighten up. Really, we should change the vibe, right? I'm not sure why but... I have this blind trust that it's all going to work out. You stated that... On the 5th of December, you were at the school gates, accompanying Martin Dreier. - Yes. - Until you were told that his sister, Dolores Dreier, would be coming by to pick him up shortly. Is that so? Yes. I had some personal business to attend to. So I notified the staff and left. After a while I called and was told he'd been picked up, so I didn't worry. And do you recall at what time you left? Leaving the kid alone at the school gates. I think it might've been at 12:45. Because school ends at 12:20, and I must've stayed for 20, 25 minutes. And at what time did you call to see if he had been picked up? It might've been about a half hour, or an hour, I don't recall exactly, but... No, it must've been less than half an hour. Mr. President, we ask that the times be compared with DiMarco and Zubizarreta's forensic results. ...When the video started you could see Camila and Ivan, a friend from college. They were both sitting on the couch in Camila's house. We all know it because she was one of the first to get her own place, and we'd go and throw parties there. They were both sitting on the couch, drinking and smoking. Relaxed. And you could tell Dolores was recording because at one point she films herself in the mirror. Then the video cuts, and now Camila is filming. And there, well... You could see... Dolores... giving... ...Ivan a blowjob. I'm sorry, I can't recall the other word. Fellatio, Miss Cantielo. Or if you'd rather, oral sex. Yes. That. So he... He took her shirt off, and unbuttoned his jeans. And then Dolores performed fellatio on him. Camila led them on, while she filmed. You could hear her voice. Then it cuts again and they're already... having sex. Both of them naked. Dolores on top and... well, then in different positions. Would you say that Dolores and Ivan knew that they were being filmed while they fornicated? Yes, they'd look into the camera, they'd look at Camila. She occasionally said something. They were just having sex, they weren't doing anything wrong. And why do you believe that Camila would send this video to her friends behind Dolores Dreier's back? I don't know, she once told me that she'd only sent it to one person and that person had sent it to the rest. But other people also told me that she herself had admitted to sending it to everyone as a joke, without measuring the consequences. I think it wasn't as much about the video itself circling around, she got mad because it was Camila the one that had uploaded it. Her best friend. "Her best friend"... I have no further questions, Mr. President. - Go ahead, Counselor. - Yes. You said making this type of videos was common. But at a certain point in the recording, the accused references the fact she's being filmed. Do you recall? Yes. Could you repeat Dolores Dreier's words? So, at a certain point while they were in the middle of doing it Camila moves up to film closer. And... And Dolores says something like Along the lines of... If she showed the video to anyone she'd kill her. Mr. President, the accused looked into Camila's eyes and said... I quote: "If anyone sees this, I'll kill you". And then she adds: "I'll kill you, bitch". Three days later this video had been seen by 3264 unique IPs. - Did you get some? - Yes. Here, Here, sweetie. - People are going back in. - You go ahead. You will be fine. Stay calm. Stay calm. It's crazy that you still have this. They threw out all the videos. They missed this one. Where is that? It's my family's farm. My grandpa bought it. It's my favourite place in the whole world. What about her dad? He left them when Camila was two years old. It was a total tragedy. A few years later Marisa met Rodolfo, that perverse shithead. Camila hated him. I always thought he lusted over Camila. Come over here! Don't go too far! At first some reporters thought he might've done it. They pointed the cameras at him and that idiot started saying nonsense. Later the prosecutor said there was not enough to accuse him. And he accused me. How did she look? When she showed up? Was she normal, happy? How was she? Why? She brought you a cookie, right? - You told me she brought you a cookie. - Yes. So then how was she? She wasn't weird. How was she, Martin? Good, she was good. Normal! Yes, that. Normal. Yes, normal! They'll try to ask you very difficult questions... So what you're saying is, you agree with your colleagues on the abnormal complexity of the wounds. Exactly. The profiles of the cuts are very erratic. The wounds follow one after another, some moderately deep, others superficial. None are fatal. Which supports the hypothesis Of a slow death, caused by blood loss. Several signs point to the use of more than one weapon as stated by the expert opinion of my colleague Daniel Sorolla. Yet, after analyzing these facts I've reached a different conclusion Different in what sense, Doctor? - Could you be more specific? - Of course. These are old tailoring scissors, carefully selected during my investigation. The fixed blade measures from 3 to 5 millimeters, and has a curved blunt-end. The mobile blade is sharp. These scissors are asymmetrical. According to how they are being grabbed they can produce cuts in different directions. Some may be deep, tearing skin and muscle, and others might go outwards, and others might go outwards, with a tendency to curve, cleaner and not as deep. As you can observe, The axis screw is loose. This can produce irregular and unpredictable movements which I believe to be the cause of the confusion of the diagnostics. The scissors could open, cutting with either one or both blades in various ways. This would explain the strangeness of the wounds scattered across Camila Nieves' body. May I remind you, Mr. President, that the accused studied Fashion Design at the University of Buenos Aires. And frequently came in contact with such tailoring tools. Mr. President, this hypothesis is inadmissible and inappropriate Totally far-fetched, especially this late into the debate. The expert here present, for whom I have the highest esteem, despite never having met her in my 40 years of practice, brings us this conclusion based on preexisting photos and reports. Isn't that right? That is correct, Counselor. But this does not alter the authority of my conclusions. Mr. President, in light of this information it would be highly convenient if a recess were to be given. The audience will be temporarily suspended, The secretary's office will inform you of the date and time that we will resume. Thank you. What's happening? What the hell is happening here? How the hell did you get in?! What is this? Honey, relax. Come here, Dolo. - Who authorized all this? - I'm calling Ignacio. Relax. Let's see what's going on. Check inside. - Who's in charge here? - Fucking shit! Please Luis, call Ignacio. Please put that back in its place! What is happening, Ignacio? The police barges into my house without notice. Were you aware of this? You need to come over right now. Just be here, please. Relax man, here's the search warrant. So, they just gave me a search warrant... Who gave you permission to smoke in here? - Can't I? - No, smoking isn't allowed in here. - I apologize very much. - Put it out please. - I saw the ashtray... - Well, put it out. - Yes, of course. Relax, sweetie. Everything open, everyone staring. What's wrong, beautiful? Never seen someone with dark skin? Get used to it, soon you will see them every day. Let's get moving. - Please. - What did Ignacio say? That the judge ordered a search after this scissors nonsense. Ignacio says he just saw it on TV. On TV?! How can they not tell us?! - What the hell is that noise?! - What are they doing?! Please don't toss all my clothes like that. There's no need! What are you even looking for?! No need to turn upside down my entire house! Come on, please. Look at what I found. Put on your gloves, Diaz! What are you doing, Martin? You let the cops in?! What the hell were you thinking?! Okay, but how long will it be until they leave? They won't tell you anything? No, it's okay. You're following them, right? Please keep an eye out. Yeah, they're going to steal everything... Okay, okay, let me know. Can I have another shake? - Want one? - Yeah. Go, grab another one. Hi, how're you, sweetie? Were you able to rest? You almost slept 24 hours. I'm scared. Come. I have something to show you. Come here... Look at this. It came a few days ago. We didn't want to tell you... to not distract you from everything else. But... I feel like sharing it, it's really good news. What is it? ECMOP. In Paris, remember? The fashion school. The one you always talked about. You got in! What? Look, look, that's it. - Look at that, sweetie. - But... It must cost a fortune. No, don't worry about that now. Plus, they give out scholarships. Or, we'll figure it out. We'll see... It's an amazing place... NO INTERNET CONNECTION Dolores! What are you doing?! Dolores, get over here. I'm asking you, please get in the car. Dolores! - Why are you here, mom? - Why are you here? Get in the car. - Right now! - Why did you follow me? Get in the car! I'm asking you, please! Dolores! Sweetheart. Listen to me, get in the car. Come on. Come here, love. Get in. Get in the car. Come here, Dolo. Dolores. I'm asking you, please. Get in. Can you please tell me why were you there? - Why did you follow me? - "Why did you follow me?!" What are you hoping for? Why did you come to her house? Look at me, Dolores! Please, look at me! - I don't know. - What don't you know? I don't know, I don't know. What don't you know? Wanted to see her... Who? Marisa?! Why did you want to see her? - Why?! - I don't know, I don't know. I don't know! I don't know! You know what, Dolo? Not even in the worst nightmare, could we possibly imagine something like this would happen to us. If I believed in God, I swear I'd pray to him every day, but I don't even have that. We're doing our best so everything turns out well. I promise. ...just look at the bastard, who she turns to! Dolores Dreier is a murderer. What an opportunist! You don't know how scared I was. - That bitch! - You can't even imagine... How is it possible that the sole suspect of a murder is roaming around my house? It's insane! I don't even know how she was granted ambulatory freedom. They found my daughter's DNA on the scissors they confiscated. Understand? CAMILA'S MOM SPEAKS I really can't... I can't believe anything. Why is Martin here? Why are you here? Don't look, sweetie, go upstairs. Dolores, take him upstairs. Go upstairs, Martin! Dolo, Dolores! Dolores, take him upstairs, will you? I still love you, Do. I don't care if you did it or not. Never say that again, understood? I'm sorry. I'm sorry sweetie, I'm sorry. Thank you. Do you really believe I would expose you on TV for money? - What are you saying, Dolores? Were you not gonna tell me about the farm Pay attention to what I'm telling you. You need to give a public response. To what Marisa said. Ignacio will explain it better. But we can't let the judge decide with Marisa's words in the background. So... Pardon me. Where were we? - Well... - You stole from us. Huh? - You stole my dad's farm. - It's not like that. Yes it is! - Can we... - Are you taking advantage of our situation. Why don't we get to work... ...on the interview? - Yes. I don't want to go on that shitty TV show. I'd rather go to jail. Can't you hear how stupid you sound? Enough. We're done with this. Do you want to speak privately for a minute? - I can leave... - No, no. Could you give us a moment? To talk with Dolores for a few minutes. Okay... Okay... Dolores... Do you want to go to jail? I don't care. - You don't care. - Yes. Do you know Ezeiza? Not the airport. The prison for women in Ezeiza. By the time you'd get out, you'd be 46. Looking like shit. Not even the dog will recognize you. Do you remember... the first time we met? What you kept repeating over and over? That you had left Camila's house and she was asleep. I know you harbor some kind of guilt inside you. I don't know exactly why. And this far down the line, it doesn't really matter. I can assure that you don't want to spend 25 years of your life 3 trapped in that hole. 3 So, tell me then how you'd like to... ...proceed with all of this. Relax. You're going to do great. Let's see how you will sit. Good, let your elbows drop, lower your shoulders. Great, and the head... Good, like that, a little to the side. Let's pretend I'm Mario. Always with a smile, it's better. Goad. And a soft, calm voice. It was a chance encounter. And? No doubt it was a mistake on our part to take that route. "I sincerely apologize to Marisa". "It won't happen again". It won't happen again. It's all going to be just fine. You look beautiful. Dolores? Are you ready? It's time. - We'll be right there. - Thank you. How are you? Hello. Nervous? Don't worry, we'll be fine. Three. Two. One. Live. And finally, as I had promised, here she is, Dolores Dreier. This is one of the most 4 resounding cases in recent years. Two friend's, one sex tape, one murder. Two destroyed families, and the beginning of a convoluted case, complex and confusing in many ways. As we wait for the resolution to the trial a large part of the public support their own theories about the culpability or innocence of 21-year-old Dolores Dreier. Dolores, today you have the chance to give us your version. To make yourself heard. First, I'd like to say hi to the people watching, and to thank them... Them, and you. For letting me as you said, give my version, and make myself heard. How do you feel the whole process is going? Do you feel you're in a tough spot? There's not incriminating evidence.. The case is built on coincidences and suppositions. My problem is they held to that Instead of exploring other possibilities; Let's talk about the revelation unveiled last week in court. After a new forensic expert affirmed that the murder weapon might've been an old pair of scissors - ...with the same characteristics. - Yes. That theory was backed by one in six of the experts, Mario. One out of six. Truth is they never reached an agreement regarding the murder weapon, nor the nature of the wounds. My lawyer, counselor Ignacio Larocca, has been pointing out all week the contradiction in the accusation. Cause on the one hand they say pre-meditated murder, while on the other... they come up with a fragile theory involving the scissors that in any case, as the expert well said, would point to a passion crime... They cling on to anything... Yes, but last Thursday they ran a DNA test, and they found Camila's DNA on the scissors. That's called inconclusive proof. They also found DNA of 3 other classmates. It's exactly what happened... at Camila's house, where they found my DNA all over. But that's obvious. I went there frequently. And there was also DNA from many different persons. Besides, Mario, who would keep the murder weapon for almost 3 years, in their house? Unfortunately the press is not talking about this. Right, that's why you're here. We know this case will be solved by technicalities. A large part of this case revolves around the uncertainty of the time of death. According to 3 out of 5 experts it's probable that you were at Camila's house at the time of her death. Not probable. Possible. I left Cami's house at... 12:30 and picked up my brother at 12:50. Between all the experts the margin for Cami's death was between 10 AM and 6 PM that Friday. So what's most probable is hat I was picking up my brother from school, or in my parent's car going to the countryside. Could be. But there are too many signs, don't you think? You're the last person who saw Camila alive. Why, if you had to pick up your brother at 12:20, did you leave Camila's house at 12:30? The personal motivation is there, it's already proven. You threatened to kill her many times. Through multiple channels. - No, well... - I confess, I find it hard to understand how you managed to forgive her. In such a short time. After she made the video go viral. I... I just can't imagine. What that must've been like for you. It's very serious we cannot just minimize it. On the other hand, there's the issue of the t-shirt. Your lawyer, here with us, argues that it disappeared from the crime scene. But the prosecution argues, it was you that made it disappear. Why? Because it was stained with blood. You're saying a lot of things I could answer if you'd give me the time. Everyone feels sorry for Marisa. And I also feel sorry for Marisa. But no one thinks it could have been me who died? What's she saying? Trust me Mario, I'm the first who wants to know who killed Camila. I'll ask, but I'm not sure. Seen from that point of view, it's very shocking. It's very shocking. Almost as shocking as hearing Marisa Nieves, here with us last week for an exclusive interview, and said, textually: that in the middle of the process, she found you at her door and she feared for her life. What were you doing at Marisa Nieves' house? I wasn't at Marisa Nieves' house. I was close to her house. I was with my mom, riding the car to my aunt's. We all live in the same neighborhood. I understand if Marisa was shocked or if it was hard for her to see me. I take full responsibility for my mistake, and having taken that route, I sincerely apologize to Marisa. Have you heard of the criminologist Emilio Thompson? He argues that the criminal's death drive makes them go back to the crime scene. As if to meld with the act, to reconcile oneself... To bring it back. You know that theory... No. I haven't heard of it. To be honest, I don't think you're conducting an impartial interview. You're accusing me head on with personal theories. No, Dolores. No, I'm doing my job. And I'm trying to find an explanation for things that frankly seem very odd. It's ok, relax, relax. I need you to be quiet. Beyond all the versions and stories, even beyond what the judges say. I believe that you... want the people to know the truth. - I'm calm. - There's no need... I'm calm. That you are not a murderer. If that is the case. I want to confess something to you. No, really! Of course, that's why we're here. I never forgave Camila. I thought a thousand times about killing her. Wanted her to me. But I did not kill her. I did not kill her... - Can you take it down a notch? - Relax. - Relax... - What the fuck are you doing? Excuse me... You went completely off-script. Wasn't bad. Actually, I think it was good. You spoke passionately. And that was very good. I can't take it anymore. You can't take it anymore... What does that mean? That "you can't take it anymore"? We mortgaged the house. We sold the farm. Your mom lost her job at the hospital, I lost my projects. Your brother... And you're telling me you "can't take it anymore"? Dad. What did you do with my backpack? Tell me something, are you stupid? Are you going crazy? Are you losing your mind? Look. I don't know what's wrong with you. But... if after everything we've done for you, you are found guilty... You'll no longer be my daughter. It's... The truest thing I've ever said. Go to sleep. The hearings will be suspended due to the long weekend. If no new evidence is presented we'll hear the pleadings on Wednesday and on Friday we shall present the verdict. Silence! Tell the truth, murderer! DO NOT CROSS When I was a kid, my dad and I used to do this all the time. I had so much fun. A river flows under this farm. It gets wider and wider as it leads to the river Parana'. I don't know if it's true. But my dad always told me that story. Dolores! What are you doing? Look at me. Tell me the truth. What truth? You threw my backpack in here, right? Why? What do you mean "why"? To... protect you. We were very lucky. No one saw you that day. Only us, get it? You seemed out of your mind. You wouldn't say a word. And when they called... to explain what had happened... Heated for you, my “we. I went into your room, and your backpack was there. With... the blood. What did you want me to do? But Dad... It wasn't me. Yes, I know, I know. I know you didn't do it, I know that, my love. When I went into the living room. Camila wasn't sleeping. She was there. Covered in blood. It was horrible. She looked dead. I swear she looked dead. “Fled to scream. But I couldn't. I just stood there, frozen. And suddenly she moved. And she looked at me. Straight into my eyes. I left her there. I left her there to die. Oh, sweetie... Look. See that... In all the photos from the party Dolores is wearing that damn Stone's shirt. See? But in this last one... The one she sleeps in. You can't see the shirt. We've been assuming all this time she still had the shirt. But that, right there, might as well be the bed sheets. - Right? - Yes, could be the bed sheets. Now look at this one. This is the last picture they took. If you compare it with the crime scene photo. All the objects were found exactly in the same position, or on the floor. Stained with blood, of course. Except for... this. Do you follow? Yes. Okay, now look here. See how some of the girls had taken off their shirts. So, if Dolores had also taken her shirt off, and the shirt ended up there, on that couch, the shirt could've been stained with blood while Camila was being killed. But that doesn't mean she did it. So then... So far, the debate focused on two alternatives. Either she was there and she killed her. Or she left before it had taken place. Now you're trying to tell me she was there asleep all along? But she didn't do it. The bedroom was far away. She was on drugs and so asleep, that she couldn't hear anything. Plus there was music. She woke up. She saw... She-saw... her friend. Dead. The horror. She realized all the leads would point to her. She grabbed the shirt from the couch, stained with blood... And out of fear, she left. But how come she didn't say a thing? Not to you, not to me, to no one, in all this time. Maybe she thought she could've done something to help her. And that's what kept her silent, and shut off all this time. Remember how she was at first. Let's suppose you're right. That all you're saying is true... What do you want to do? But... but she can't be convicted if she didn't do it. Let's see. At this point in the trial, there are enough blind spots... To give place to doubt. If Martin does well on his statement, I'd say our chances are 50/50. But if we change our defense, we could be making a big mistake. Because with what you're telling me, Luis, they could make a case for abandonment and neglect. And could ask for 5 to 15 years In prison, depending on the circumstances. If we at least had the shirt we could try... to prove your theory. But we don't even have the shirt. Look, Ignacio... The day of Camila's death... On the farm. - That afternoon... - Luis. I can't say it like Ignacio does. I can't get it right. You just say it however it comes out. Tell the truth. What about this creature? Yes, it's called a stegosaurus. Oh, really? Stegosaurus. Stegosaurus? I'd never heard of it. Is he a good or a bad guy? He's good, he's a herbivore. He eats fruits and vegetables. - He's not going to eat us. And tell me... That day, when your teacher left. Did your sister take long to come pick you up? No, I think she arrived quickly. And when she got there... How did she seem? Did she seem tired, or worried about something? She said her head hurt. Because she had drunk alcohol the night before and... That she hadn't gotten a lot of sleep. But apart from that she was okay. You didn't notice anything weird. Weird? No, nothing. She was... normal. And did you chat or talk about something? Yeah, we talked about... Her party, she told me a bit. And then she asked about school and I also told her. Oh, and she brought me a cookie. Chocolate? No, milk caramel. But that day she took a long while to come pick you up, isn't that right? Sometimes, when she takes too long... I start naming countries in alphabetic order. Really? And what country did you get to that day? Do you remember? No. That day I didn't even start counting, she showed up very fast. Concerning case number 6578 against Dolores Inés Dreier.

Thanks. - Hi. - Drop them in the kitchen, will you? - Okay. We started doing the paperwork. It's not easy.
