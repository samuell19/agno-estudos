You have to understand, I didn't call to patch things up with you. You have to understand, I didn't call to patch things up with you. We haven't met in the last few weeks. Do you intend to hide from me forever? We haven't met in the last few weeks. Do you intend to hide from me forever? Don't worry about me, I won't do anything stupid. Though I'm really unhappy Don't worry about me, I won't do anything stupid. Though I'm really unhappy. Luckily this is a nice place. If I really feel sad, then I'll just wander around. Luckily this is a nice place. If I really feel sad, then I'll just wander around. —Tell me, am I right? —Tell me, am I right? You are right! Brian, sometimes I really hate you! Don't you know how to lie to me? Mandy, are we still friends? Our relationship is over. That's for sure. We can still be friends. But I don't want to see you anymore! Hey man, we run a small business here. Besides, this is an island. Shut up! Gosh, you are so nasty! I don't care if you ask for protection money, but don't spit here. I feel like it! What can you do? —Good morning! —I'm here to collect protection money. You hit me? Let me tell you the truth. —Maggie and I... —I know! —What does she has that I don't have? —I know! What does she has that I don't have? Anyway, I wish the two of you a happy future together. Anyway, I wish the two of you a happy future together. —Don't invite me to your wedding. —Don't invite me to your wedding. Maggie is next to me. Do you want to talk to her? No! No! What do you want...? What do you want? Stop messing around! Kam Shui, go for it. —Don't cut my hair! —Don't move. Don't cut it! Stop it! You're useless! This island belongs to me. York is my friend. Go back to Cheung Chau Island! Don't ever come back here again. Understand? Bloody mute, I'll remember you! Hang up! He's already hung up! Help! I don't know how to swim. You're good! Kam Shui! Kam Shui, you are awesome! —Help! —Go get him a life buoy! Without saying a word, he ran in and took the barber's scissors. Look! What has this world come to? Uncle Hing, what do you want him to say? Sure, he is your man, of course you will protect him. Don't put it this way. Uncle Hing, we are family! —Look... —Forget it, he's just a kid. Don't get mad. Officer Pang. Did you two cause trouble again? Officer Pang, you've come at the right time. What's wrong, Uncle Hing? He took my scissors and used it to fight. He slapped me too. He slapped you? That's not what you said earlier. Are you lying? Liar! Uncle Hing, loosen up a little, okay? He just borrowed your stuff, and he didn't break it. Now he has already returned it to you, what else do you want? Well, how about an apology? Apology? Okay, follow me... Uncle Hing, forget about it. Please drink this. No way! You are a generous person, forgive him, okay? After all, Kam Shui is a mute kid. Do you want him to suffer for the rest of his life? No... Drink it and forgive him, okay? Drink! Come on! The two of you, come with me. There's nothing to see here... You two fools! You're always causing trouble! Officer Pang, it won't happen again. You're lucky your dad had many friends when he was alive. Otherwise, your neighbours would never let you get away with this! And you! He's lost his father. At least you have a foster Caucasian father. You have a home and money to go to school. But yet, you hang out with him all day long. It's not good for you! Yes... Thanks, Officer Pang. I hear you. But you are really annoying! Room for Rent Room for Rent Be careful! Which way? —This way? —Come! This way. Sorry, miss. Please give way. You go first. That's right. —Be careful... —Move... I want to rent a room. I'd like some peace and quiet. HK$250 per night, be it for one or two persons. I'll stay for a night. Hey, someone wants a room! —Is there hot and cold water? —Yes! Where are you? This is quite a nice place! Have we met before? If you don't remember, forget it. Do you have luncheon meat and egg sandwiches? Thanks! I am going to play Mahjong. I left you some food in the refrigerator. If you are hungry, cook some rice, and reheat the dishes. You are eating instant noodles again. You eat that stuff every day! No wonder you are so thin! I'm off! Come on! Ring! You always ring for no reason. And now you're making not a sound. Trying to be cool? What's the matter with you? I am your owner, mind you. Are you mute? What have you said to him earlier? Since we can't be friends, why should I return your page? He's paging you! Maybe he has something to tell you, right? But why would he page you if you're no longer friends? What are you looking at? Your boyfriend broke up with you? Do I have a sign on my forehead that says "I fell out of love"? Smart aleck! Is it that obvious? I thought I hid it well. You don't look like you have much experience! It's not that bad. Every time he calls me, he writes me a poem. I forget to tell you. I answer calls from people... who have problems with love. You can say I'm a counsellor. But, don't call me. I really can't help you. So what's your name? You don't have a name? I told you we can't be friends. You're not answering my questions. Are you mute? So you are really mute. Have you seen enough? Are you a good fighter? I fell out of love, so I am happy. Quit staring into space! Go to sleep! Turn in soon! Kam Shui What are you looking at? She left early this morning. Stop doing nothing with your life. When you have time, take care of the store. When you need to place orders, ask Uncle Kai to help. Deposit the sales collected into the bank before a quarter to four every day. —Are you listening to me? —Sure, Eighth Aunt! No problem! I will look after him for you. You? Forget it. Look at you two. You're like two peas in a pod. Two bottles of beer, thanks! I'll get it. Eighth Aunt, I heard you're moving... to your daughter's place in Kowloon tomorrow. I can't help it, I have rheumatism and difficulty walking. It always takes a long time to travel to Kowloon to see a doctor. Isn't this great? Your daughter will look after you... and her husband is a capable man. They just want me there to take care of their kid. Thank you! Bye! I bought you new shoes, try them on. New shoes! They're very pretty! Do they fit? So, do they fit? From now on, you'd better get your act together. I can't look after you anymore. I had wanted to take you with me to Kowloon. But you can't talk. How are you going to make a living if I take you with me? Your dad died young... and your mum left you behind and ran off with another man. You were only six or seven years old then. Your grandfather brought you to me. I told him I was a widow and already raising three kids of my own. How could I take care of you? But it was kind of bizarre. The moment I held you, you stopped crying. You looked so pitiful. So I couldn't bear not to take you in. I don't have high hopes for you. I just hope you'll be an honest man and can make a living. What's the matter with you? Are you a good fighter? Kam Shui! Look! Isn't this a pretty MD player? Just now, I saw an idiot daydreaming in the restaurant. And I stole this from her when she wasn't paying attention. Pretty, eh? Look! It's that idiot! What? I remember you. It so happened that my new house is not ready yet... and my old lease has run out. Coincidentally, I'm also on vacation... and have just fell out of love. Don't you think I should just kill myself? Commit suicide? I don't have the courage. Not only did I fall out of love, my MD player was also stolen. What are you laughing at? I'm quite used to breakups actually. He's probably paging me right now. One, two, three. He's probably busy working. Since I'm in such a sad situation... can you give me a discount on my rent? Thanks! I wish to be alone now. Yes? Eat? No, thanks. Drink? No, thanks. Maybe later. Swim? What stroke? Just call me Officer Pang. I am Angel. Why do they call me Angel? Because when I play Mahjong, I always bring them good luck. My big brother, Kam Shui. Oh, Kam Shui. I'm Mandy. But I'm not quite good at playing Mahjong. Don't worry, we're just playing for fun. Don't worry, we're not good at it either. Relax, I'll be the judge, you will definitely win. What a thing to say! —What's that? —Two of Circles. Can I take it back? You can't! He said it's okay. Give her a break. Just keep your eyes open. She already said she's not good at it. One of Circles? You threw the tile. Angel! I thought you said you were bad at this. No wonder people say, you win some, you lose some. I don't believe you will win. Did you throw Two of Characters? Wait... But she could take back the tile earlier! Pay up! You won again? You fell out of love, but do you need to win so much? I don't want to play anymore. Yeah, let's stop! Yeah, I'm tired. Let's stop. He won't page me. I don't even know why I am waiting. Do you know why I become a counsellor? I had hoped that someone would call one day... and tell me about his or her romantic story. But after I listened to romantic stories day and day out... soon I realised that, no matter how romantic their stories are... no matter if the couple is a perfect match or not... they merely fall madly in love because of that few moving lines. Imagine this. Someone stands at the ship's bow with you and says... You jump, I jump. Upon hearing this, this woman would love this man for the rest of her life. Do you know what the silliest thing is about love? No matter how much you love a person... you are going to despise him one day. Although it's just a matter of time we'd break up, and I know our relationship won't last forever, he should at least call me. He's just too much to vanish on me. After all, we were once lovers. Tell me, if he calls me, should I give him another chance? Maybe my pager is not getting any reception. He's not going to call you, you'd better forget about him. I don't understand! What are you doing? Okay, I get it... Do I know you very well? Don't be silly. There are plenty of men available. What do you want now? Commit suicide? Don't get so melodramatic. I just want to throw away my pager and get over him. You want to throw it away for me? I want you to throw it farther, don't let me find it again! It rang! Forget it, it's all over now. Why are you so happy? This has nothing to do with you. My MD player! I can't believe I found it here. Look! Good! I lost something but found another. Nice! Of course, this is a very cool place. Kam Shui! Do you always practice boxing here? Look, there used to be Kam Shui's house. That's his room. It wasn't there in the beginning. It was built after he was born. That's the roof top. I remembered that the bed was over there. The door was here, and the window faced the ocean. When I was little, I liked to climb up to a chair and get a better view... of the ships passing by. And I would call out, "Dad..." His dad was a sailor. But he died in a shipwreck. His mum ran away with another man. There was a time when he got really sick... and after that he lost his voice. Thanks! So this is the sign for drink. It's very easy! This is the sign for taking drug. This is the right way to say you want to drink. Yes! How about going to Kowloon? Are you leaving? As a matter of fact, my new house is almost ready. I will be leaving in two days. Mandy, stay longer. Our boat is almost completed. Then we can go sailing together, okay? To tell you the truth, I will miss your hairstyle! And you? Eat this. Tell you the truth, I don't know you that well. I don't know what encouraging words to say to you. Do you have any ambitions? You don't want to think about it. But if you don't give it a try, how will you ever know? Let me ask you a question. A woman is pregnant but she already has eight children. Amongst the eight children, three of them are deaf, two are blind... and one is mentally challenged. And she has venereal disease. Tell me, should the woman give birth to her unborn child? If everybody thinks like you... Beethoven would never be born. Beethoven? Who is Beethoven? Good morning, Kam Shui! Three bowls? Can you finish them all? Close your eyes. So how did you learn sign language? Sign language? My sister is deaf. So I went to learn and that was where I met Kam Shui. And you became his lackey since then? Lackey? He is not a gangster. He is a mute, who will want him? But he is a nice person. He beat up my scoundrel dad for me. —He beat up your dad? —Yeah, my useless dad. He drank all day and hit my mum. He even sexually assaulted me. That's quite enough. I look odd. No, you look quite good! Don't wipe it off! Look over here! Mandy. I wish I were as pretty as you. You're quite good-looking yourself. Can I touch you? Where do you want to touch? It's so soft! It's prickly! —It feels like a man's chin. —Kam Shui! Get me Kam Shui! He went out. What are you doing? What do you want? Kam Shui! Kam Shui! Angel! Kam Shui, forget it! Forget it. Leave me alone. Kam Shui. It smells strong! Thanks! How are you? Do you need a doctor? How do you sign thanks? I love you. I thank you. But saying thanks is not enough. You gave me a discount for the rent, you bought me dinner... and acted as my bodyguard. I want to give you a gift. It's just a small gift. You're a grown man and you're still asking for gifts? The gift is hidden in my room, go look for it yourself! Hey! Help me clean up! What are you looking for? Mandy prepared a gift for me. So you like her. No, she likes you. If she doesn't like you, why would she give you a gift? It will be good if you and Mandy become an item. I hear she is leaving tomorrow, so you have to... Clear up the mess. Mandy, I love you. What are you writing? Is it strawberry or apple-flavoured? Does it taste good? I will stay for a couple more days. I want to tell you something. I have fallen for someone. What? I can't control how I feel. It's Paul, the fire fighter. The guy who handed me a towel when we played volleyball. Do you remember him? He's nice, he doesn't talk much. The guys I used to know either have a glib tongue... or talk crudely. Isn't it better not to talk at all? So she likes that fire fighter. He is very handsome! What's passed is already gone. Try to let it go, Kam Shui. Don't get your clothes wet! Call for more help! There are three of you and you guys can't even do it right. Over there! Kam Shui, you're great! Thanks! Let's go eat after work. Cheers... We had played volleyball together. I just got transferred here. —I'm Hon and he's Paul. —I'm Ken. He is Kam Shui, I am Angel. I had wanted to be a fire fighter. A fire fighter's job is very dangerous and tough. It's no joke. But fire fighters get to save people. Didn't you just save a pig earlier? It's no big deal. It's late, why don't we go play volleyball next time? —Waiter, check please. —Kam Shui, you forgot something. Do you remember that girl? Which one? The one that played volleyball with us. You gave her your towel! Don't you remember her? My towel? I don't remember. Think carefully! She says that she really likes you. Stop joking around. A joke? She's very pretty. You will like her. I can't even remember her face, stop kidding me. Is this it? You don't have to hit me. I spent the whole day looking for it for you. Do you know that you are very corny? Why are you so nosy? It's my own business, you didn't have to tell him. Do you think this is a negotiation? Now, he shuns away from me as if he had seen a ghost! What is that? I'm sorry, I bought you a fish. Please accept my apology. It's dead. I said, you are a nice person. It'll be nice if you can be my boyfriend someday. I'm not good enough for you? Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! No problem! How do you know I live here? This is my roommate. Kam Shui asks you if you like Mandy or not. Let's talk upstairs. Come on, hurry. Say something. Well... she is quite pretty. So you like her. —I told you so. —But... Then you should do something about it. Moron... Like what? I'm not good at courting girls. If you want to court a girl, you have to give her flowers. Give her flowers? It's... He says he will help you. What? You're going to help him? Kam Shui, are we there yet? Are you blind? Aren't these flowers? Why can't we just pick these? There's no need to walk this far. I wish someone would give me flowers. What? From Paul It's so corny. Come on, you like it. I know. No, not this. He can't find the gift you prepared for him. You can't get it if you can't find it. Put more effort into finding it. Kam Shui, I have a feeling I will bump into him today. —Thanks for your flowers. —Don't mention it. That silly fellow is so shy. Do you think he will write me love letters? How should I write it? I'm better at putting out fire. You'll write down what I say? It'll be great if you can do that. I'll buy you dinner. You are my best buddy! Here I go. Miss Mandy, I miss you dearly whenever I don't see you. Write this down first. I am boorish. I don't know how to whisper sweet nothings. But I'm really a caring person. I know how to play a little harmonica, but I'm not very good at it. Ever since you came... I just can't get you out of my head. You have a cheerful and independent personality. I think I need a girl like you to ease my loneliness. My unsettling inner feelings tell me... that I have fallen in love with you unknowingly. My spring has arrived. I hope you can feel the beauty of the full bloom flowers in spring... and bask in the brilliance of spring like I do. I don't know if this is such a good idea. Quit dawdling. Do we need to do everything for you? Follow me. They look like a perfect couple! Give me a pack of Marlboro. Boss! What do you think the adulterous couple are doing right now? When will they get married? If they invite me to their wedding banquet, I will surely turn up. Kids, when will they have kids? Why don't you be their godfather? What do you think? Hey! You don't have to be so upset. Why don't we watch a pornographic film? Just pretend that the porn star is Mandy. I've broken up with Paul. I will leave tomorrow morning. You and Mandy... What's this word? Oh, did we... No. We did nothing. You mean you didn't write the letter... and you don't know how to play the harmonica? Does that make me a bad person? Thanks for telling me the truth. To tell you the truth, I just wanted to give it a try. And how do you feel? We both like each other, but it's not going to work out. I can't expect her to do anything for me and she doesn't know what she wants. Nobody knows what to do. She is very unhappy. I don't understand. We can't get along with each other. What about us? It is hard to accept. It came and left quickly. I never have an experience like this. But are we going to keep on trying? You tell me. How? My mother asks you to have dinner with us if you have time. What? Your mother? I heard she's leaving tomorrow. —What? —She's about to leave, go find her! Why are you adamant about getting me and her together? You like her but you won't tell her. Stop bothering me. Seriously, if you like her, you don't have to say it. She can see it with her own eyes. It's hard for both if you to say it. It was easy for us. But look where it has gotten us. So, why don't you make the first move? Why should I always be the one to confess my feelings? Let me do it for you. That's okay, just buy me this meal. Kam Shui. Relax, she cannot leave. I've locked her in her room. You shouldn't do this. This is terrible. I'm washing my hair and there's no water. I have shampoo all over my head. Kam Shui, take a deep breath. Can you smell the sea water? I think if I have eighty years to live, I won't remember today's world events. But I will definitely remember... you used mineral water to wash my hair on this ocean-view balcony. The phone is ringing. This is my address and phone number. If you go to Hong Kong, remember to come and see me. You don't have to see me out. Bye! Mandy Koo I forget to return the key. Mandy. Can you stay? He said that he likes me. Dear Kam Shui, how are you? How are the dogs? How is the lighter I gave you? I am doing well in United Kingdom. Bye. From: Angel. I'm leaving, Boss. Thanks! I fell out of love, so I am happy. This is a gift for Kam Shui. From: Mandy Kam Shui. —Kam Shui. —Where are you rushing off to? Kam Shui... Where are you rushing off to? Going to fight again? Going to Hong Kong? You are wearing slippers. How can you go to Hong Kong like this? Go home and change into a pair of shoes. Why does he want to go Hong Kong? I thought you had gone out. I stole a few hundred dollars from your drawer. I will give it back to you. Here's the money. Kam Shui, please let me go. Thanks! Leave now. In the last couple of years, my turf was overtaken by others. And I became a drug addict and have nothing left. What about you, Kam Shui? Why do you treat me like this? Why does Angel like you, and not me? I don't need your kindness! I don't need your pity! Hello... Look at you, you're making a mess. Hold this for me. —Hello...? —Is it Daddy? I don't know. Hello, who is this? Hello, who is this? Hello? Kam Shui. Kam Shui, are you okay?
