--== McEphie ==-- Go ahead. How's our sale? It's okay, boss. Can I get a drink over here. Massage me harder, will you? Here's your drink, boss. Can I have some of that shabu (crystal meth), boss? Here's the ice you asked for. I'm sorry for the delay, boss. Here, deliver this. Sure thing, sir. Boss, cheers! I told you to massage me harder! Just continue. Fuck, the gin has water on it again. Damn you! Mmm, how sweet. Mmm, you smell so nice. One more round? No. Stop it. I'm tired now. How grumpy. I love you! You know, I think our son will take on after me. Fuck you then! I don't want our child to end up just like you. Now, that's just cruel. Just change your ways then. When I get to save enough money, I promise that I will change. Stop! Stop right there! Come on, just one more round. Stop right there! Don't move! Stay down! Stay down! This is the police! Please have mercy! Leave him be! Stay down! I'll be back. Open the door, this is the police! Fucking open this door now or I'll kick it down! Where's Jefferson? He's not here. Check the back. Go there and check it! Stay down! Put your hands down! God damn it! For sure someone is going to get killed again. Stop taking pictures or you might get shot! No way! Sir, I surrender! I'm not a drug pusher! I'm just a user! Oh, so you're surrending, huh? Yes, sir! Oh no! Look! Another one dead! My husband! My husband! You killed him when he surrendered already! Fuck you, animals! You have no shame! Fuck you! You motherfuckers! You animals! You're all animals, you fuckers! Animals! You're all animals! How dare you? Sir, those two who ran to the other house got cornered by my men already. Hey! Stop! Fuck! Hurry up! Here they come! Sir, please don't! I have a child! I have a family! No one will support them if you kill me. Please, I'll change for the better! I won't sell drugs anymore! Sir! Please, sir! Move aside! Are you sure your husband got arrested? Didn't you say he ran when the police went to your house? Answer me! Are you sure he got arrested? No, sir. Then why are you looking for him here? I was just trying my luck. If he didn't run, I'm sure he'd be jailed here. If not here, maybe some other precinct, and he'll be alive and breathing, but he ran away, didn't he? Don't come blaming us if something bad had happened to him. Don't look for him here. Maybe he got killed by his fellow pushers so he won't testify against them. Bang! Bang! Kids, go home already. It's late. The police might pay you a visit and arrest all of you! Hey, Martha! How's Jeff? Have you seen him yet? Times like these are scary. They've been slaughtering people like chickens! It's all so terrifying. Move aside! My husband! My husband! He didn't do anything! Why did you kill him? He already surrendered! He didn't do anything wrong! Why did you kill him? Maybe they killed him some other place and dumped him here. Oh my, what a pity. They deserve it. They're all addicts anyway. Yes, they're addicts. They deserve to die! Hey, Martha! Oh hey, Totie! How's it going? Do you know? What happened to Jeff? Has he contacted you? He hasn't. He hasn't called me either. I'm sorry, but if he was still alive, he would've contacted you already. I believe he might've been killed by the police already. You know how it is these days. The police are on a rampage. If I were you, I'd go home already. You might get involved. Totie, will you help me find him? Maybe when things cool down a bit. Even the badasses are in hiding now. Alright, thank you. Martha, did Jeff leave you any drugs? If he does, just give it to me. Go, beat him up! Don't shoot! Dude! Dude! Don't follow! Don't hurt the child! I am your ally here! Stand down, relax! Dude, put that down. Look at me. Look at me! Guys! Stand down! Do you want some money? Look at me. Look at me! Dude, there's no problem. Dude, there's no problem. No one is going to hurt you. Just don't hurt the girl. Stop right there! Stop! Stop! I told you not to fucking shoot! Close that door. Sir, Major's here. Is there a problem, sir? Colonel just called. He wants you to turn your operation down a notch. The media keeps reporting us. But we just started, sir. What's this? Are we just fooling around? Stop complaining. The order came from the upper management. There's nothing we can do. This is why these criminals have the guts to walk around anywhere! Just a little tweet from the media and we just hide away and give up! Hey! Don't say that to me. Talk to the management if you want! What if I don't follow the orders? Then you'll be in danger. They will pin you down and no one will protect you. The best thing to do is to do exactly what you are told. Alright. Okay, sir. What do we now, sir? Let's continue. Fuck those bastards! Why would I listen to them? Where are you, Jeff? Show yourself to me if you're still alive! You're such a stubborn person. I told you to stop and you didn't. Please let me know if you're dead or alive. So that I can also be at peace with it. I love you so much. Please don't die. Please don't die. Get out of the way! Move! You! Come with us! Go back to sleep! Do you know this guy? No, sir. I don't. He's a drug pusher. If he bails out, he's just going to sell drugs again. He's going to ruin more lives. Beat him up. Sir? You heard me. No, please! Have mercy! Punch him! Sir, have mercy please! Son of a bitch! You're too weak! Please have mercy! I told you to beat him up! Sir, please! I don't want to die yet! Go beat him up some more! Have you seen Pancho? He's inside. Ladies! Looks like you've won a lot! Give me some don't be so greedy! Brother! Where's your kid? My neighbor is taking care of the baby. Where's Jeff? It's been two weeks already. I need to find him. Please help me. I've searched all the precincts that I know, too. Maybe there are still some you haven't visited yet. I won't rest until I find him. Dead or alive, I need to find him! Please, help me. A corpse just arrived in earlier. If you want to look at him, go now while my boss is gone. So? Are you going to look? Come on, hurry. Let's go! That's not Jeff anyway! There are a lot of corpses that were left here in those holes. Here, these are the new ones they just dumped. Over here. This guy is a pusher from Pasay, man. This one? Put him in there! How about this one? He's also a pusher. Sir, can I tell my wife where I am at least? You haven't done anything good for us yet, and now you're asking for favors already? Who's your supplier? Who's your supplier? Who? His name is Badong, Sir. Badong who? Badong Palakol. He's from Navotas. Do you really want to change your ways, Jeff? Yes, sir. I can't hear you. Yes, sir! I want to change. Look at me. From now on, you're a new person. You are now an enemy of illegal drugs, of greedy assholes and of scums of society. Do you understand? That's where the drugs are coming from, sir. His little restaurant is just a front. There, that's Badong. He's got a gun but I'm sure you can arrest him now. He has a gun, huh? Lagman, take out the gun. Do you know how to use this one? I don't know how to use it, sir. What the fuck? You really are stupid. Lagman, show him. Here you go, bro. Take it. Didn't you say you want to change? Prove it. Kill that supplier of yours. Hey, Jeff! I thought you were dead! What happened to you? I laid low. Cops were on to me. What do you need? What else? Come, follow me. How much do you want? Just for self use. Wait for a second. You know, the prices these days have changed. We're left with no choice. Go ahead. Make sure you're not with the police. I don't like it when people are betraying me. Since, of course, I just want to make sure. Look at you, you're so paranoid. I was just making sure. What is this? A head swap? Go ahead, shoot me! What happened? That's twenty thousand. That's not payment. Just a little something for your trouble. We're not doing this for the money alone, but for our principles. For the country's sake and peace. From now on, you're a member of my team. Is that clear? What's new, Martha? Is Jeff home? It's been so long! If I were you, I'd stop asking Martha and just stop taking drugs! You might end up like Jeff! Lady, go talk to your son instead. We just do drugs for fun, while your son eats and breathes shabu (crystal meth)! Really now? Then go fuck yourselves, losers! I'm going now. Thank you so much. I'll go ahead. Thank you, brother. Martha, stay strong. Whatever happens to Jeff, life should go on. Just think of your child. Brother, your business. Are you sure it's not illegal? What are you talking about? It's just a small-time gambling business. If there's anything illegal going on in there, just stop it. I don't want you to get into trouble. Just don't worry. I paid City Hall for this. They won't touch me. Be careful either way, okay? I'll go ahead. Please let go of my baby! Have mercy! Please! This is your fault! Where is your husband? He's not here! He's missing! He's missing! Please don't! Don't do it! Martha! Jeff! Where have you been? Why did you leave, just like that? Why didn't you contact me? I was so worried about you! It's a long story. But the important thing is that I'm home. I've been watching him. He's having such a good sleep. I thought I've lost you. You know that's not going to happen. Where did you go, really? Did the police arrest you? Where did you hide? Why are they still looking for you? It's not safe for you to be here! It's okay now. I've resolved it. I got arrested and jailed. But my case got dismissed. Maybe because they lack evidence against me. They let you live? Isn't it obvious? Why? Why did they do that? Maybe they took pity on me? I don't know. Just leave it be. Just don't ever do it again, okay? Which one? Don't ever leave me again. I can't live without you by my side. I'd go crazy. Come here. Don't cry anymore. I'm here. Are you okay now? I've missed you so much! I've missed you, too! When you grow up, you'll become an engineer, okay? You're going to make mom and dad a big house. The one with a swimming pool, okay? You're too ambitious. Well, if I'm going to dream then I should dream big. Isn't it why they call it dreaming? Did anyone ever dreamed of something so little for themselves? You're such a smartmouth! Before that happens, you have to change your ways first. You're late for the news. Your husband already changed. You're not a drug pusher anymore? I might be the one to kill all the pushers here. You're such a prick. Babe, always remember that I will never let my child grow up in this kind of society. I won't let our child become a drug addict. Did you eat something weird? A pussy. You're such a pervert! What? It's delicious! Don't be like your dad! Who's there? Hey, Jeff! Come in! Son of a bitch, I was worried about you! Are you okay? I'm alright, man. What happened? Why did it take you so long to come back? I got arrested. But it's all solved now. Holy fuck, you're so lucky that you're alive. That's your second life now. You're right, bro. That's why I'm changing my ways now. I won't do drugs anymore. I won't be a drug pusher anymore. Fuck you! Are you serious? But Martha, you're pretty lucky. Aside from coming back from the dead, damn, your husband even changed his ways! You know, bro, I thought about it and I realized what the police are doing are actually good to get rid of vices. Shabu is the main reason of crime here. Ain't that right, bro? Well, you are right. If I were you, bro. Just a brotherly advice here, stay away from the addicts in our area. You might get involved. You got a point. That's true. I'll go ahead. Where are you going? I need to work, remember? If that's something shady again, huh? I changed my ways, right? Here, for our expenses. Where did this come from? Not from drugs, that's for sure. I promised I won't be selling those anymore, remember? Alright, I'll go ahead now. Okay, please be careful. Alright, I love you. Love you. [Speaking on radio] We're here at Isla Puting Bato Our subject: Drug pushers and users. We've arrested thirty people already, and managed to confiscate half a kilo of Shabu. Dude, this may be the largest supplier of drugs in all of Tondo. [Reporter on the radio] Eight victims of extra judicial killing have been found in a dark corner of Calapan Street. Meanwhile, shooting of alleged drug pushers was caught on a CCTV camera along Ilaya Street. The suspects couldn't be identified since they're wearing helmets and shades. They are all merciless! Those motherfuckers! I thought you're going to call Major? Hello, Major? This is Andoy. Hello, Andoy. What happened to our deal? Is that still happening? Our deliveries got jacked again. And I lost four men! I'm very sorry. There are still some who won't follow instructions from the management. Why? Am I not paying you enough? Just tell me. Don't worry, I'll fix this. Well, you should, Major. We're all earning from this after all. We're all going down if I get arrested. Jeff? Celestino is mad again at you, sir. Even your assignments are getting the bad rap. Fuck him, he can reassign me if he wants! Does he think I'm going to stop if I get assigned to a different place? That asshole! Sir, don't take it too seriously. As long as we're here, damn it, we're going to kill all those drug pushers. Do you have a job for us? Yes. Congressman wants Don Ragay dead. He's the drug supplier in his district. That's a bit difficult, sir. He's a former soldier. It'll be hard to come near him. Here, for the boys. Is it still too hard for you to accomplish? Not anymore, sir. Who will you send for this job? To Jeff. Babe. Babe, where did you get that? Put that down it might go off! Tell me the truth first! Where did this come from? Why do you have this gun? Don't lie to me you son of a bitch! I'll fucking shoot you! Babe, take it easy! What the fuck is happening to you? Did you really get arrested? Where did you go? You've been gone for a month and I don't know you anymore! It's like you're a new person! Babe, give me the gun please. Come on, please. Give it to me. Babe, I'll tell you everything. Just stop crying. Do you really want to change your ways, Jeff? Yes, sir! And you agreed? Do I have a choice? You know what? They're right. We're just killing the scums of society. The ones who ruin other people's lives. Aside from Badong, who else did you kill? Aside from him, I've killed three people, Martha. I've made my choice. This is my life now. Until when are they going to use you? Until there are addicts and drug pushers in this world. What about us? What about our future? Our chilld? Babe, nothing will ever change our dreams. I'll provide for this family. Babe, I'll earn big there. We'll finally get to save money. How long are you going to kill, so that you can live? Here. His car is bulletproof so killing him on the streets is impossible. However, there's a place he goes to where you can kill him. There's a bar in Avenida where he hangs out every night. He's quick and a sharp shooter. That's why you have to shoot him in close range. Surround him! Fire! Boss, the police! Police! Let's go! Martha! Open the door! Hurry! Quick! Jeff! Babe, what happened to you? What happened? We got in a fight. Wait, I'll clean it up! No need! This is just a scratch. I'll survive. Don't bother! I will call Pancho and have him buy antibiotics and a torniquet. No need, I'm fine. Sir, Jeff failed. God damn it! Where are they? Irinco is dead. Jeff managed to escape. Fuck! Finish his job. Sir, the target is more alert now. Maybe we should lay low. Don't delay that assignment. Congressman is going to get mad! If you have to the job yourself, do it. Yes, sir! Fuck you, Jeff! You just gave me a fucking problem to deal with, you animal! I told you it was just a scratch! No, it's not, babe. Come on, that's nothing. Don't worry, babe. This won't happen again. Next time, I'll be more careful. Thanks, brother. What the hell happened? We got caught in a crossfire. I got wounded. Crossfire? Where? Just some drug pusher. You shot a drug pusher? Why? What did he do to you? To me? Nothing. But to the country? Yes. Are you with the police? Yes. Bro, I shouldn't be telling you this but I am now a police asset. I've joined their operations. And you agreed? Isn't this better? I'm on the side of the law now. Alright, I have to go now. Get well, bro. Okay, bro. Brother! Brother! I know you're confused about Jeff's situation. Is that what he has to do in exchange of his freedom? Kill his own? He's being forced into it! You know what he's putting himself into is no joke and he won't be able to back out of that ever again! And there's a huge possibility of you and your child getting involved in this. I can't leave him, brother. I love Jeff so much. Fuck that love! That's what's going to get you into trouble! Sir! Sir! Finish Ragay. Put a bullet in his head. Make sure he's not going breathe again. Is that clear? Yes, sir. But can I rest, first? The target is too sneaky. I need proper timing. Just tell me if you can't fucking do it so that I can end you, you moron! Sir-- Sir, please don't. Fuck you! Please, don't include my child in this. Sir! Sir, please don't! Sir, please don't involve my family! I'm begging you! I will kill Ragay for you. I'll do it! Martha, don't! Sir, I'll do it! Shut up! Shut up! Sir, don't involve my wife! What did you say? What did you say? I'll finish Jeff's assignment. Perhaps you could. Ragay won't suspect anything if you go near him. That's a great idea, husband and wife assassins. Fine, don't you fucking double-cross me or I'll kill you both! Alright, I'll leave you to it. Let's go. This is where we practice shooting. Go ahead, pull the trigger. How are you? Are you okay? I love you. I love you too. Aling Trining! Wow! You look gorgeous, Martha! Please, come in. Aling Trining, please take care of the baby. Don't worry, I'm on it. Like what the Inspector said, this is not payment. Just a means to buy your needs. We're not doing this for the money alone, we're doing it for-- The country? You know, the Inspector is going to like you two. Especially you, Martha. It's his first time to see a woman assassin. And it's the first time he's having a husband and wife tandem on his team. Martha, you will be a great help to keep the peace and order here. This is the first and the last assignment of Martha, sir. I thought we agreed on that. We agreed she just needs to kill Ragay. Jeff, Martha can't leave the team anymore. She's a criminal like you now. Sir, that's not part of the deal! Do you think Ragay's men won't hunt you when they find out who killed their boss? They won't forgive Martha. Why? Who's going to tell on us? I will. So if I were you, I will do what I am told. We're not your enemies here. We are a team against drugs and against all those bad motherfuckers! Babe, go to sleep. I can't. I can still see his face. Just think that what you did is right. Ragay is a bad person. He ruined a lot of lives and he would've ruined more if you didn't kill him. I understand now. I understand why you have to embrace that twisted principle they have planted in your brain now. You need to think that what you're doing is for peace, for the country. Because if you don't do that, your conscience will eat you. Maybe we need to do drastic measures against that Inspector Bagani. Maybe we need to have him killed. Not yet. It's not the right time, Andoy. If we kill him now, eyes will be on you. Remember, the people's sympathy is on him. How? How long are we going to wait? Don't worry, if our deal fails, I'll hand him to you. Major. Thanks, Andoy. Major, we will wait for the results of your deal. You can count on it. Sir. What is it, Major? Aren't you tired of dealing with me? This is your last warning, Inspector. If you don't stop those illegal activities of yours, I'm telling you, something bad is going to happen to you. Why, Major? Are you going to have me killed? What do you think of me? A killer like you? You talk like you're conscience is clean! I know a syndicate is paying you! How much are you getting from your drug lord, Major? Fuck you! Go ahead! Point a gun at me! Let's see where your angst gets you! The management will hear about this! Fuck him. His balls went back up his ass! Does he even have the balls? I don't even know how much he's getting from this. He'll be shocked once we kill his drug lord. Do you have a job for us? It's Andoy. Sir, he's a big time drug lord. He's got connections upstairs! I don't give a fuck. Do the job. Make sure you do it perfectly. Yes, sir. Daddy? Chase them! Chase them! I almost lost you earlier. I just thought of one thing at that time. I can't live without you. I can lose everything, except you. Martha, leave me. Go and take our child somewhere far. Leave me here. I won't leave without you. Let's finish this together. Wherever this takes us, I won't leave you. What about our child? There are a lot of people who can take care of our baby. But you? Only I can take care of you. My condolences. Sweetie, we're just going to talk about something. Go sit over there. I am saddened about what happened, Megan. I want them dead. All the people responsible for my husband's death. Kill them all. You will have your revenge for Andoy. I will make sure of it! Do it! Oh, big brother! Glad you're here. I've missed you. Where's Jeff? He just went somewhere. He'll be back soon. I heard you're always out. They always see you with Jeff. What do you mean? Martha, your husband is a killer and you are always seen with him? Are my suspisicions correct? Leave him, Martha. Take your child and hide. He will understand that. It's too late. What do you mean that it's too late? I'm doing the jobs with Jeff now! Fuck, Martha! Why did you join him? Why? I'm sorry, brother. "Sorry"? Fuck you! Brother, if something happens to Jeff and I, please take care of our baby? For your trouble. Thank you. By the way, the Inspector wants you to do another job. Who's the target? He's Andoy distributor. Bro! What the fuck is this? What are you doing here? Let's just talk please! Fuck you! Let's just talk please! You've involved my sister in this! You know I didn't mean for that to happen! What do you mean you didn't mean it? You're a lousy husband, Jeff! Listen to me first! You involved my sister into your shit! Listen to me first! You want me to listen to you? No, you listen to me! From now on, I don't want to see your fucking face around here! Bro, your life is in danger! Don't you understand? You're a pusher, right? You're one of those distributing drugs around this area! Aren't you? Answer me! Fuck you, Jeff! We're talking about you, not me! Answer me! You're the bad guy here! Fuck, shoot me here! Pull the trigger, Jeff! Shoot me! You know I don't want to kill you. Then don't point your fucking gun at me! You need to leave now! Your life is in danger. Take Martha with you. Convince her to leave this place! Go! How about you? I'll finish this. They won't stop until I kill all of them. They will use us for their games forever if I don't finish it. I will surrender. I'll testify against Bagani and all of them. Please, leave! Fuck you, Jeff. You think I don't know Pancho is your brother-in-law? That was a test of your loyalty and you failed. You're finished! Five million. No more, no less. You can count it if you want. Martha, will you just listen to me? This is all my fault. Because of my decisions, I got you involved. This is the time to atone for my mistakes. Leave this to me. The case against them will become stronger if we testify together. Jeff is right. It's better if you come out of hiding after he gets in the Witness Protection program. What took you so long? You had me waiting long. Sorry, I just took care of things. Who's going to do Jeff and Pancho? Is it settled? There is something you have to know, sir. What? Celestino wants you dead. Damn him! He thinks he can outsmart me? Before he can do that, I'll outsmart him first! He already did, sir. Bro. Let's go. Did you find them? They escaped, sir. But I'm pretty sure they're just around. Keep your eyes peeled. They're around here somewhere. Let's move! Go on, Martha. Escape now! Run! I won't leave you! Do you want our kid to get shot? Get out of here! Go on, run! Martha, run now! Go inside! Go on! Hurry! Go on! Hurry! We're coming in! Circle around the area, sir! Alright, we'll go around. Chase them! Hurry up! Corner them! Hurry!
