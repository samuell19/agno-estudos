ACCORDING TO DA RULES, PARAGRAPH 1,225, ARTICLE "K," SUBSECTION KRINGLE, IF A GODCHILD SHOULD INJURE A HOLIDAY ICON AND PREVENT SAID ICON FROM PERFORMING THEIR HOLIDAY DUTIES... - [giggles] HE SAID "DOODIES." - [giggles] - THEN... THE GODCHILD IN QUESTION MUST ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THAT ICON UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE ICON IS ABLE TO PERFORM AGAIN. - OKAY, JORGEN. IN ENGLISH, PLEASE? - FINE.

[groans] - THAT'S MORE AN EXPRESSION OF DOUBT. - WELL, I TOOK A SHOT. - GUYS, GUYS, GUYS. WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING ABOUT? - THE FAIRIES AND ELVES HAVE BEEN FEUDING FOR CENTURIES. - THAT'S BECAUSE FAIRIES ALWAYS RUIN EVERYTHING. - EVERYONE, FOCUS. TIMMY BEING SANTA CLAUS JUST MIGHT WORK. - REALLY? - BRING ME SANTA'S HAT. IF WHAT THAT MUSCLE HEAD SAYS IS TRUE AND YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE SANTA POSITION, THEN THE WORKSHOP SHOULD RESPOND TO YOU. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO TEST IT. PUT IT ON. crash! [twinkling music] * - WHOA. [all cheering] - SYSTEM REBOOT. - [laughs] - IT'S WORKING. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. - TAKE YOUR PLACES, EVERYONE.

"CLOSE THE GATE SO THE REINDEER WON'T ESCAPE," HMM. HMM. [grunts] [groans] DEAL WITH IT. [alarm blaring] - WHAT'S HAPPENING, TIMMY? - WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. - WHAT IS IT? - TIMMY TURNER CAN'T BE SANTA CLAUS. - WHY NOT? - BECAUSE TIMMY TURNER IS ON THE NAUGHTY LIST. - [gulps] - WELL, THEN THESE NEED TO DISAPPEAR. - M-M-M-ME? - BUT HOW DID TIMMY END UP ON THE NAUGHTY LIST? - MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT HE ALMOST KILLED SANTA. - OR THE FACT THAT HE MESSED UP CHRISTMAS IN THE FIRST PLACE BY GRANTING SO MANY WISHES. - OR THE FACT THAT HE HAS TERRIBLE BODY ODOR, CRIES IN HIS SLEEP-- OH, WAIT. THAT'S ME. - HEY. NO BIG DEAL. I CAN TOTALLY FIX THIS MESS. ALL I GOT TO DO IS HAVE COSMO, WANDA, AND POOF ZAP ME OFF THE NAUGHTY LIST. SIMPLE. - IF THERE'S ONE THING FAIRIES UNDERSTAND, IT'S SIMPLE. - OH, REALLY? WELL, IT WOULD BE SIMPLE TO TURN YOU INTO A POOPER SCOOPER. - [whimpers] - WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M NOT GETTING ANY MAGIC RECEPTION IN MY WAND. - ME NEITHER. I GOT NO BARS. I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. I GOT PEOPLE COMING OVER TONIGHT. - WITH THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT POWER DOWN, THE NORTH POLE'S MAGNETIC POLARITY IS RENDERING YOUR FAIRY MAGIC USELESS. - OKAY. OKAY. HOW DO I GET MY NAME OFF THE NAUGHTY LIST? - THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY. - [gasps] - TELL US, DINGLE DAVE. I MEAN, TIMMY WILL DO ANYTHING. - WELL, SURELY YOU DON'T MEAN... - YES. ELMER THE ELDER ELF. [all whimpering] HE SEES ALL. HE KNOWS ALL. ONLY HE HAS THE POWER TO TAKE SOMEONE OFF THE NAUGHTY LIST. - WELL, EASY. I'LL JUST GO TO THIS ELMER THE ELDER ELF'S HOUSE AND ASK HIM TO TAKE ME OFF THE NAUGHTY LIST. - IT'S NOT THAT EASY, TIMMY. PEOPLE HAVE TRIED, AND-- - WELL, TIMMY HAS TO DO SOMETHING. THERE'S TWO DAYS LEFT UNTIL CHRISTMAS, AND REAL SANTA DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE'S GONNA BE READY ANYTIME SOON. - [giggling] I'M A PRETTY LITTLE BALLERINA. [giggling] WHEE! - LOOK. I OWE THIS TO SANTA CLAUS. OKAY, OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, THERE IS ANOTHER LITTLE BOY DREAMING OF A WENDY WEE-WEE DOLL. I MEAN A FOOTBALL. AND I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT KID DOWN. IF I HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THIS ELMER THE ELDER ELF'S REALM, I'LL DO IT-- ALONE. - WITHOUT MAGIC, TIMMY? - OH, TIMMY CAN DO ANYTHING. RIGHT, TIMMY? - YEAH. HOW HARD CAN IT BE? - THE PATH TO ELMER'S REALM IS FRAUGHT WITH DEATH AND DANGER AND MORE DANGEROUS DANGER. - AND--AND BY "DANGER," YOU MEAN... - YOU MAY NOT MAKE IT BACK ALIVE, TIMMY TURNER. - I'M GOING WITH YOU. WE'RE A TEAM. - AND I, UNFORTUNATELY, WILL NOT BE GOING, BECAUSE I'M EXTREMELY ALLERGIC TO DANGER. - YOU'RE COMING TOO. - FINE, BUT IF MY TONGUE SWELLS UP-- [slurring] OH, NO, IT'S ALREADY STARTED. - [grunts] - MR. CROCKER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - OH, WELL, IT'S A LONG STORY THAT INVOLVES A FREEZING CAR RIDE, REINDEER POOP, AND AN EAR SHARPENER. BELIEVE ME, THAT PART-- NOT PRETTY. BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT. YOU SEE, I AM HERE BECAUSE I AM COMING ALONG TO GET MY NAME TAKEN OFF THE NAUGHTY LIST TOO. - WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME, MR. CROCKER. WE'LL ALL GO TOGETHER. - WHATEVER. - WELL, YOU'RE GONNA NEED A GUIDE. - AND SOMEONE TO CARRY BACK YOUR BODIES. - HUH? - AND YOU'RE ALSO GONNA NEED THIS. [swelling orchestral music] * - [sighs] - [shivering] - COLD. - WHICH WAY NOW, GUYS? - NEVER FEAR, TIMMY. IT'S OBVIOUS. THE REALM OF ELMER IS-- both: THAT WAY! RIGHT. THAT WAY. - [sighs] - OH, I WISH YOU COULD WISH FOR DIRECTIONS, BUT MY WAND'S AS USELESS AS COSMO'S INVISIBILITY HELMET. - WANDA, I'M RIGHT HERE. SHE CAN'T SEE ME. - I THOUGHT YOU GUYS SAID YOU KNEW THE NORTH POLE LIKE THE BACK OF YOUR HAND. - OH, TYPICAL ELVES-- NO SENSE OF DIRECTION. - [scoffs] OH, YEAH? WELL, TYPICAL FAIRIES-- NO TASTE IN HUSBANDS. - [gasps] - HEY! - HOW DARE YOU? I HAVE FANTASTIC TASTE IN HUSBANDS. - OKAY, THAT'S IT. - [groans] WHAT DID I DO? - I CAN'T KICK HIM. HE'S FLOATING. - HA, YOU'RE SO SHORT, YOU COULDN'T KICK A FLEA'S KNEES. - BURN. - OH, YEAH? [grunts] - OH! - HA! MISSED ME! - [grunts] WHAT IS THE DEAL? - HE'S GOT SNOWBALLS. I CAN'T KICK HIM. - WHAT WAS THAT? [both gasp] - THERE'S NOTHING THERE, TOOTIE. - BUT JUST TO BE SAFE, WE'LL HIDE IN TIMMY'S POCKET. [zipper zips] - HEY, GUYS. OVER THERE. - [gasps] - [gasps] THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRANSPORT US OVER THE CRACKED CANDY CANE CHASM TO THE FORBIDDEN FOREST. THE CHASM FLOOR IS MILES BELOW. IT'S MADE UP ENTIRELY OF ANCIENT RAZOR-SHARP BROKEN CANDY CANES. - ALL POINTED OWIE SIDE UP. ONE SLIP, AND YOU'RE PEPPERMINT SHISH KEBAB! - YOU KNOW, GUYS, MAYBE THIS WASN'T THE BEST IDEA. - WHOO!
