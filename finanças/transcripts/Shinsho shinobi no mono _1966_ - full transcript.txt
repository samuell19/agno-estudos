A DAIEI COMPANY, LTD. PRODUCTION TEMBUN ERA TEMBUN ERA Toward the end of the Tembun era (1532-1555), Shogun Ashikaga's powers were weakening by the day. And many were those who planned to overthrow him. It was the beginning of the Warring States period. Father. The leg came off, eh? All right. Hey, Kojiro! We'll be going to Kokuchu so I'll get you a better toy, okay? - When? - Huh...? One, two, three... In three more days that gunpowder will be complete. To reach Kokuchu we have to travel about 11 leagues. My offerings will be given to the lord, and your father will be rich. Five men. Listen to me. Don't come out, no matter what happens! Don't make a sound! Okay? Where's the gunpowder? Search! He must have hidden it! Damn it! Iju, there's an opening under the floorboards! There it is! Be careful, it's going to blow! Stop, Iju!

Kai's great warrior, Takeda Shingen, based his military strategy on the gathering of information by his team of ninja and the ability to attack from anywhere. In order to raise his 'Furinkazan' flag (Wind-Forest-Fire-Mountain) above Kyoto he set out to build up his empire. The man who was trying to stop Takeda, Tokugawa Ieyasu, had become a daimyo under the hands of Oda Nobunaga. This was his first major campaign as a soldier at age 32. I'm very sorry. I have failed. It must be Kai's ninja. They never fail to get all of Nobunaga's secret couriers, no matter what they have to do. Their fundamental character is different from a ninja like me that is only after money. Please teach me! I won't be able to avenge my father unless I learn a technique that can defeat them! No. There's nothing left for me to teach you. But if you still want to become stronger, go to Kai. In Kai, there's man named Kurodo Sadayu. - Where is he? - I don't know. I've never met him, nor would I know where he is. But, Kurodo Sadayu is definitely somewhere in Kai! Kurodo Sadayu-sama. You're already here. It's not done yet? It's done. I'm just adding the finishing touches. I'm Chitose. It's nice to meet you. - Sak√©? - Yeah. I see. Who was that man? Speak up! You were a ninja after all, eh? I felt it at the polisher's. Was that a ninja from Nobunaga's side? Maybe. Yafuse Iju? Isn't that right? So what if it is Iju? I'll kill him! Kill? Can you...? I will. You have parents, too, don't you? My father was killed by three men. I saw them from my hiding place. His arm was cut right off. Blood spurted everywhere and he died in pain! And the smiling one. He was covered in father's blood. His face has been burned into my eyes for the last 20 years. That was Yafuse Iju! No matter what I have to do, I'll get Iju... Damn... Iju! Iju is hurrying towards Anegawa! ANEGAWA Nobunaga, who was putting all his passion toward unifying Japan, started to annihilate anything or anyone who got in his way. Even the husband of Nobunaga's younger sister Oichi, Asai Nagamasa, was destroyed by Ieyasu's unified army. This was the Battle of Anegawa. Madara. Make it brief. At Shingen's mansion, a message arrived from Ashikaga Yoshiaki instructing Shingen to take Yonagawa. What? A letter from the shogun to subjugate Nobunaga-dono? Lord Ieyasu! Lord Ieyasu! I'm returning to Hamamatsu in 2 days. Keep me informed of Shingen's every move! Yes, sir! Who's there? That's the face! What? I've been looking for you, Yafuse Iju. Who's there? - Kasumi Kojiro. - Kasumi...? Don't know the name. Why are you looking for me? There's something I must take from you. You're a green youth who knows nothing. What do you want to take from me? - Your right arm! - What? Twenty years ago, you used your sickle to cut off Kasumi Kanbei's right arm! Oh... You're talking about when we wasted our time trying to steal some gunpowder. And by the way, kid. You are? Kanbei's son Kojiro. I've lived my life these last twenty years in order to kill you! Quit it! If you make me mad, one arm isn't the only thing that will get cut off! My father's arm spurted blood right in front of my eyes! Your right arm is going to spurt blood the very same way! Damn you! What's wrong, kid? Does your wound hurt? Luckily it's not infected. The pain should go away in a couple of days. Did you dress it? Who are you working for? Who are you going to deliver this to? Nobunaga? Ieyasu? Then...? Kai's Kurodo Sadayu-sama. - Kurodo Sadayu? - That's right. Why? I'm going to give this to him as a gift and get him to let me join his ninja group. I see. Wait. I must give this to Sadayu-sama as soon as possible. You already have. I'm Kurodo Sadayu. What's your name? Kasumi Kojiro. Please! Please teach me to become a full-fledged ninja! Why do you want to become a ninja? I want to avenge my father. - Next. - Sir. It's the building plans for Hamamatsu Castle. It's a magnificent piece of architecture. Better than I'd heard. This will probably take a few months to bring down even if we attack with the whole army. Katsuya. When he moved his castle from Okazaki to Hamamatsu, what do you suppose Ieyasu was thinking? I believe it is to prepare against us. Prepare? That's too simple a word. He has decided and announced that he is going against me. Things are happening faster than expected. Very well. You've finally got it. Yes. But you've still got a lot to learn. Those techniques won't be enough to kill the other two. Yes. If you value your life, stay away from Akane-san. Akane? The chief has come home. The battle between Takeda Shingen-dono and Tokugawa Ieyasu will finally begin. It will be a huge battle, the likes of which we've never seen before. We ninja, have a lot to work for as well. It is the norm that ninja must not work for anyone, but only for themselves. But as all of you know, Takeda Shingen-dono is different. Unlike Nobunaga or Ieyasu, he is a rare person who understands us ninja. I plan to give my all in order to serve him. You may go if you understand. Kojiro. Attack me. Anywhere you want. Think that the one before you is your father's murderer. What's wrong? Why don't you kill me? Wait. One more time. Akane, what are you thinking about? Tonight's music had a slight hesitation to it. Father, it must be your ears. Is that so? Is that man, Kojiro-sama, still at it? He'll be no good if he quits. In order to be better than others, you must make several times more effort and train harder. Why so strict? I want to make him strong, and have him under me, no matter what. No matter what...? Akane, this has nothing to do with you. You understand that? Eat this. Hot rice gruel and lion's meat. It will give you energy. Hurry up and eat! You brought this without the chief's knowledge? Who cares about that! What's wrong? Why do you look at me that way? I was thinking that you don't look like the chief at all. He's not my real father. I am the child of an Iga ninja who was killed by him. To you, the chief is... My sworn enemy. If you know that, don't you think about killing him? I think that is the fate of one who was born in a country of ninja. That's wrong! Because you're in a country of ninja, you should seek revenge. Even though you're a woman, shouldn't you become... a female ninja and seek revenge for your father? What will that do? That will only make me less happy. Don't you hate the chief? Revenge? Hatred? I've had enough! If you were me right now, Kojiro-sama, what would you do? Would you seek revenge? I would. Revenge must be sought at any cost! What's so funny? That. Akane. Say, uh... Thank you for the food. Do you like the flute? I was told that my life would be in danger if I came close... to you, Akane-san. Two have died. Died? Father said that he will not let me marry a ninja. And killed them? And you were all right with that? I wasn't all right. - But... - But? I could kind of understand what my father felt. I don't want to become the wife of a ninja, either. But I've become close to you. Akane-san! The year 1572 in Manshu. Takeda Shingen, who felt that this was the right time, began his campaign to conquer the nation. The army of 28,000 going through Kai hurried down Kisoji to go after Tokugawa Ieyasu first. The battle between the ninja had begun. I'm sure that Nobunaga and Ieyasu will be letting... out their best ninja in this battle. I am still... That's right. You must become at least equal to them. The best way to win is to become a coward. When you've found a way to escape in case something happens, you can go against them without any hesitation. Did you get it? What's with that face? Anyway, get ready. Sir. You've finally mastered it. I'll take you with me. Thank you very much! Your father's killer is probably among the ninja sent out by Nobunaga or Ieyasu. - You should be prepared for that. - Yes! First we head towards the mountains of Okazaki. Our targets are Nobunaga's messengers. Hurry up and get ready if you understand! Yes! Do you have to go? Yes, I must. Kojiro-sama, you must not die! We're going, Kojiro! Take this! My heart will always be with you. Kojiro-sama... HAMAMATSU I think tonight's camp will be set up in Iida. Yes, that's all right. But it is about 30 leagues from Iida to here in Hamamatsu. There are two ways to get here. Which will Shingen take? Ono via Mikawabe, then go through Iida to get to Hamamatsu, I believe. If Shingen's ultimate goal is to get to Kyoto, then I think that's right. I disagree. From Iida, he'll go down Aokuzure Pass, through Inui and Futamata to attack Hamamatsu. That's the shortest way, and the local warrior, Amano Kagetsura in Inui has had a friendly relationship with Shingen. It's the best way for Shingen. Even if it is the shortest route, Aokuzure is one of the roughest mountains. It's not easy to get 28,000 troops through there. No. Our opponents are the 'Mountain Monkeys of Kai.' - They're skilled mountain fighters. - However... Hold it! Shingen's 'kitsutsuki' tactic looks like he'll take the main path, but then go through the back. Or by using the 'Kishuu' tactic... he can pretend to attack from the west, but really come at night from the east. Arguing is pointless, we don't know what Shingen is planning to do. But if we don't make plans... I know! Against Shingen's 28,000 troops, our allies don't have even half that. We don't have the resources to split the army. The only thing we can do... is hold on until Nobunaga-dono's backup army arrives. Sakakibara. Hasn't there been notice from the backup army yet? You fool! I'm very sorry! Being sorry isn't enough! Why aren't you answering me? I strictly told you not to take your eyes off the messengers for even a moment! I have failed! Failed? How can you come back here after losing to another ninja?! What has Nobunaga written? "I will send the backup army as soon as I can. "The commanding General is Hirata Hirohide, with 5,000 troops." And that he's waiting for news of winning the battle. Sadayu! You alone are equal to 100... no, 1,000 men! Don't you think so, Anayama? I think so, too, my lord! Hurry and send the message through the whole army. We're going to bring down Futamata Castle! Sir. Sadayu! Yes. How many men do you have? Eighteen, my lord. Call them as soon as you can, and take them all to Futamata! Yes, sir! FUTAMATA CASTLE Lower the bridge! Raise it! This is their only well. And the secret passage? It starts here in the castle, and leads to here through an underground passage. That's good. We'll go through the passage, and dig from here towards the well. We'll use the dirt from the hole to fill the rest of the passage. Kill two birds with one stone. I see. The well won't have any water, and the secret passage will be of no use. The people in the castle will be caught in a corner. If we dig from here, it's about 30 feet. Splitting up into three teams, digging nonstop and taking turns will take two full days. It will be tough. No... It's been a while since we... ninja used our tunnel digging skills to do a surprise attack. - Want to switch? - Yes, please. Hey, next round. All right. Come on, wake up! Let's go! - It's really quiet, isn't it? - Yes, it's a little strange. I heard that a night attack is Takeda Shingen's best tactic. But there's no sign of that at all. Just a bit more. Water! Hey! Water is seeping out! All right! Water... Just a little more! - Hey, let's switch! - Hurry. Hey, we're getting close to the water! Just a little bit more! We did it! Water! Water! Water! Are we really low on water? Yes, sir. It's mostly dried up. How can this be? This well has never dried up, even in the worst drought! Good! That was a great job! Tell your men that Shingen said thank you. All armies attack! My throat is parched! I can't take it! I need water! We have so much rice, but we can't even cook it! Just hold on a little longer! Oda's backup army will come! What's wrong? The secret escape passage has been sealed shut! What is it? Nobunaga's army has crossed the Kiso River! If they've crossed the Kiso River, that means they'll arrive in five days. What's the condition of those inside the castle? Sir, even without water, they are staking their hopes on the arrival of Nobunaga's army. They're tenacious. Sadayu! Is Sadayu there? I am here, my lord. How far to the bottom of the well? About two feet. Start digging immediately! Yes, sir. However, the water is flowing rapidly and... Just dig! The passage is breaking! Go and tell the chief about that! All right! What? The dirt is crumbling? Yes. If we keep digging, we'll be buried alive! What's wrong? The water is up to our chests! We have no more time! My lord! Very well. I'm calling it off. You may all rest. Yes. Anayama. Have the preparations been made? Yes. Hurry! Hurry up! I wonder what happened to the others. They're late. No! Wait! It's too late! That Shingen! He's trapping them inside! Emergency message to Lord Tokugawa from Futamata Castle! Let me through! Futamata Castle's Tenmatsu, what happened to Shingen?! After bringing down the castle, they've left a small group of soldiers to guard the place, and are flooding down to Hamamatsu without rest. The army...?! What is Nobunaga's army doing?! Forgive me. This is Kurodo Sadayu's greatest failure. Shingen, you're no good! I can't let you live...! I promise to seek revenge for your lives. Just wait... It will be the next night you hear this flute. After bringing down Futamata Castle, Shingen used that momentum to back him up for going south towards Hamamatsu Castle and set up his army accordingly. My lord, Shingen has moved! What? Towards Hamamatsu? Well, it seems that he is going west. - West? - Mikatagahara is to the west. Does this mean that he's given up toppling Hamamatsu Castle? Maybe he's returning to Kyoto first. That's impossible! I believe there is something behind this! Madara, are you there?! What are you doing?! Reporting! The enemy has stopped at Mikatagahara! Stopped? Nobunaga's army has passed Okazaki. They've come, huh? How does Hamamatsu Castle seem? They have kept the castle doors closed tight. Will Ieyasu take the bait? Ieyasu has just become a lord. He hasn't given any bribes or presents to the... local samurai to bring them under his control. Now is the time to crush Ieyasu. But we can't take too long to do so. That's exactly why... I'm trying to bring him out of the castle to Mikatagahara. Will Ieyasu come out? He will. If he doesn't, the local samurai will be disappointed, and Nobunaga's name will be diminished. If Ieyasu wants to make his name, he must come out! That's what I am counting on! Advancing isn't everything! Leaving this impregnable castle and going to fight an advancing enemy is not a good idea. It is irrational! Lord, please reconsider this! The eyes of all the local samurai are on me. If I don't fight, and lose to Shingen's challenge, they will leave me and go to Shingen's side. Yes, but knowing that we are at such a disadvantage... Sakakibara! After knowing that Nobunaga's army is on the way, if I shut myself up in the castle, Lord Nobunaga's trust in me will go all the way down. - But... - Enough! Lord, where are you going? Leave me alone for a while. You must be a ninja. Shingen's objective is to break your relationship with the local samurai... and to isolate you from the other clans. You expect me to believe you? It's up to you to believe me or not. Why are you telling me this? Because of my hatred for Shingen. Wait! - What is your name? - Kasumi Kojiro. My lord! Shingen is going to Kyoto! What? I'm positive. This is accurate information that I... Stop! Do you know a ninja by the name Kasumi Kojiro? Not at all. You fool! Ieyasu came out. But even looking from various viewpoints, they were at a serious disadvantage and only a few hours after meeting, Ieyasu's army was utterly destroyed and fled back to Hamamatsu Castle. Hurry up! What are you dilly-dallying about? Damn it. He promised us that there wouldn't be any fighting. It's your fault for coming out here at a time like this to try and make some money! Madara, been a while, hasn't it? When did Yafuse no Iju become the 'One-Armed' Iju? Madara... It's your fault that I became like this in the first place. What? 20 years ago, when I stupidly went along with you... to steal some gunpowder from Kasumi Kanbei. His son did this. Being defeated by some kid? Your skills have deteriorated, haven't they? Hey, wait! I know that it's my own fault for getting my arm cut off. Come on... Take me in. Take you in? Please. Without an arm, a ninja is as good as dead. Please! If you know that, you'd better go and die! Chitose, what are you doing? Hurry up! Iju hasn't come back yet. Where is he at a time like this? He left saying that he was going to get the valuables from the dead and wounded. A war thief, huh? If he goes out to town with that booty he may wind up dead as well. Let him be! Iju! Why are you doing this? If I had known things would be this way, I would have died years ago! No! If you pull it out, it's the end right here. If you see Kasumi Kojiro... What shall I do if I see him? Tell him the second enemy is... Ma... Madara no Yashamaru... Madara no Yashamaru? That man just now...? The third enemy... Who is the third? He has a scar... here... Scar...? He's got a scar on his left hand? Iju? Iju...? Iju! Kasumi's son...! - Kojiro. - Die! Oh. Getting pretty lively. A little too much. Let them do what they want. We're going to invade Hamamatsu Castle at sunrise. Ieyasu is already completely vulnerable. Things will be over if we finish him off in one thrust. But Nobunaga in Kyoto won't be that easy. It's a samurai's life to live today as if there is no tomorrow. It's a flute. Yes. There are still those who have elegance amidst the bloodshed. Father! Father! Don't make a fuss. You must not make a fuss. Father! Father! Make sure the soldiers don't find out. Sir. Father! Father! Take your positions! Father! Be quiet! Who's there?! Now I can fight my best even if they attack. Honda, how are the soldiers? Yes, everyone is so riled up saying they'll get those Kai monkeys! Good. That way I can find a way to die gloriously on the battlefield. My lord! They're here? No! They've moved their entire army towards the Nagashino road! Nagashino road? Not Owara? No. I saw it with my own eyes! Damn! The Kishuu tactic yet again? I eavesdropped on Katsuyori and Anayama and it seems that they'll retreat to Kai at once! What? Retreat back to Kai? There are only about 1,000 of us to protect the castle, and they could defeat us with ease. So why is Shingen...? There must be a reason. Katsuyori and Anayama were acting strange, too. Something must have happened. Madara! Find out the reason! - Sir! - Go! Excuse me! What's with your long faces? Well?! We've been saved! We don't have to die now! That's right, we're saved! We're saved...! We're saved! Wait! Oh, it's you. Iju killed himself. I'm surprised he kept on living until now. Why didn't you do it? He wasn't worth killing. You're Madara Yashamaru, aren't you? That Iju... He talked too much. Do you know Kasumi Kojiro? I don't. - Well, does that hurt? - No, it's all right now. It's a great thing to be young. I'm going to find out if Shingen is really dead. I'll go, too. You, too? Madara works under Ieyasu. He will be there to find that out, too. I must get him this time. Have you remembered the third enemy yet? Nothing yet. Sometimes I think I might remember, but... You'll find him someday. I'm going to Nagashino to find out exactly how Shingen is doing. Wait here. Hey, do you want to take a rest here? I've got work to do. Hey! Where are you going? Water. I can't do much if I'm thirsty. What's so funny? That. Get out of the way! Kojiro-san... Move! Wake up, Kojiro-san! I'll kill you both! Kojiro-san! Does that hurt? Are you in pain? That's what my father felt 20 years ago! Kill me! No, I'm not going to kill you! Suffer more! Feel the pain! There was another... There was another man who mercilessly stabbed my father... when he was writhing in pain. Who is the third man? Tell me! Kojiro-san... Brace up! The other man who killed your father... This... What about your hand? Left hand... scar... Scar? Iju said... that he has a scar on... his left hand... Iju...? I'm cold... Hold me tight... Chitose! His left hand... ...has a scar on it. When someone is in pain, killing him with one thrust can be merciful. Shingen is at Horai-ji Temple. I'm going to see if he's dead or not with my own eyes. What are you going to do? I will go with you, chief. You'll come. Anayama, Jyoan isn't here yet? He should be here soon. I'm not... ...going to die yet! Even if... I die... Hide the fact for three years and bring stability to the court first... Don't hold a funeral for me... Just put me in a plain coffin... and let me sink to the bottom of Lake Suwa... Those are my orders...! Dr. Jyoan has arrived. My lord? Father! Lord! Blood was wiped off. I felt resistance. Guards! It's a ninja! Father! The 'Furinkazan' flag... on the dirt of Kyoto... Search everywhere! Find them! Father! He's dead! Kojiro. Kill me. Come and get me. I taught you everything to prepare you for this day. Here I come. There they are! Where?! On the rooftop! Chief! Kojiro... you must quit being a ninja from now on... I was not killed by you... all right? Take care of Akane for me... Akane! THE END Special Thanks to: Ichiban and Batman
