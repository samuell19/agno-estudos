You move real nice, you know that? Say, you can't hear me, can you? I ain't never talked to no deaf chick before. You're real pretty, you know that? Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Brenda? Marrying Richie and everything? If I had a guy that wanted to marry me, you don't think I'd get out of this shit hole? Richie didn't exactly wanna marry me... Till I told him I was pregnant. I know he loves me. I mean, he would've married me sooner or later. This just sorta makes it sooner. Promise you won't tell anyone, okay? Honey, I love you like a sister. We're gonna throw you a wedding you'll never forget. All right, Heather's waiting for me so I'm gonna go, and I'll see you at the MX Club later, okay? - Okay. Just remember, I'm the godmother, so if it's a girl, Brenda's the name. Okay. Oh no. No! Okay, okay, lemme see if I got it straight. Hey, now I got one to teach you. You know what this means? Come on, try it, go on. Come on, come on, yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it, yeah. Not so fast, you little whore. You and I have things to discuss. Cindy, Cindy, Cindy, god, this is your lucky day, and you wanna know why? I'll tell you. See, I don't have time to kick your ass right now, so you best be moving out of my way, okay? I want you to stay away from my boyfriend. Oh god, Wes, that faggot? Aw, come on, now who the hell wants him? He's mine, understand? So keep your hands off. God, you stupid, stuck up cunt. If you could make him stay away from me, I'd be eternally grateful to you. You're the one, you keep leading him on! Let me see if I can make this simpler so that even you can understand. I wouldn't fuck him if he had the last dick on earth. I bet you never been kissed by a real man before. You have? Who kissed you, huh, who? I don't know what you're talking about, baby. Oh, your father. Where's he now? Dead, huh? That's too bad. Shit, kissing your old man, that don't count. He's fucking dead. And I'm alive and twitching. So how about you and me have a crack at it, huh? What do you think? Sure. Come here, come here. See? Slut. Yeah, come here, yeah. Like that, bitch, you like that! Don't you like it?

Happy birthday, Vin. Yeah, come on Jake, get him down. Come on, Vinny! Yeah, fuck her, Vinny, come on. Get that goddamn thing out of your mouth. Would you please stop crying, Miss Clark? Would you please stop crying? Thank you. Now blow your nose and get the hell out of here. Brenda, you give me nothing but grief. I won't have it. Goddamn it, I simply will not have it. And I'm warning you for the last time! You what what, I don't understand it. You're a bright girl. You got a pretty face, a good figure. Red's turn. Fargo's turn. It's Red's turn. How'd it go, Bren? How'd it go. That moron's been trying to get in my pants since I was a freshman. He's harmless, even his own hand turns him down. Ay yay yay, me estoy muriendo! In English. Oh, I said, ooh, I'm about to pee my pants! - Well go! - I'll see you at the gym. I hope Heather's okay, she's been waiting for a long time. She's fine, she can take care of herself. Let's move. Go, let's go. I said, let's move. Heather! Heather! Shit girl, what you yelling for? Heather's deaf, you dumb shit. Hey Brenda, isn't this Heather's stuff? Oh my god, oh my god, Brenda, Brenda! It's all too much for me. Brenda? I know, mom. I gotta open up early today. Go ahead, I'll be fine. The cops said Jake and the Scars were at the school an hour before it happened. Oh yes, would you bring us another round, Susie? And tell Jack they're on the house. Do you have any idea who did this? No. As you can sure bet, I'm gonna find out who did it. She couldn't even scream for help. All I keep seeing is this little girl trying to open her mouth and nothing comes out. So what's your school gonna do about it? Put us in the gym and make some speech. Even the cops are a bunch of pussies. It's up to us to make things right. - You're probably right. - Damn right. We're gonna get him. Damn right. Now look, you better be careful. Whoever these dudes are, they don't just play games. Charlene, what if I lose her? She's gonna make it, honey, you just gotta believe! In what? God? I gave up when my father died. Charlene, I love her so much. What am I gonna do if Heather dies? Jesus Christ, you scared the hell out of me. What are you so worried about, Vince-y boy, I bet she enjoyed it. I didn't go to school today. I didn't hear nothing. You didn't go to school today? Oh shit. Why, you felt sick? Yeah, I was sick. I felt sick, Jake. Come on, you're coming with us. Where we going? We're gonna go have a good time, then we're gonna get laid. Oh, no no no, I don't think so. Wouldn't be a good idea. I'm gonna go home. Go get your jacket. I hate this city. Me and Richie are thinking about moving away. What? When the time's right? Yeah, I wanna have kids soon, ya know? Yeah, I don't want my kid growing up in this shit. Me and Richie are thinking about getting a farm. Right. Yeah, you know, with dogs and horses, that kinda stuff. Don't forget the pigs. Baby pigs. I hope you do. I know it sounds dumb. I don't know shit about farming. The way I figure it, if I can survive all the crap on this street, I can sure as hell raise a chicken or two. Why not? I've gotta go the bathroom so bad I'm gonna have to wring out my socks. I'll be right back. Keep all the girls away from Richie. Be right back. ♪ If you get too close to her she'll cut you like a knife ♪ ♪ She's a girl ♪ Just the kind I like ♪ She's got a passion deep inside her ♪ ♪ She has a taste for sweet revenge ♪ ♪ Like a tune that never seems to end ♪ Do you mind excusing us? Go take a walk. You got something for me? Yeah, I got the money right here, Jake. Some guy, Fadden. I told you he was a right guy. I think we should make him an honorary Scar. Can I go now, Jake? You're still here? Fucking dick. Hey, ain't this great? You get to stay up late tonight. I don't think Vince-y's having a good time. We'll get your lady fix, Vince-y. Come on, Jake. That little pee-pee gonna be working overtime tonight, deputy. - It's irate! - Come on, don't. What do you think, Vince-y? Huh, huh? Please! You want it, you got it. Oh, I'm sorry darling, Vinny's not into girls. Hey! Here's one for ya, Vince-y. What do you think? She ain't got no tits, man. It's like fucking a boy. All right, look. Don't smell too bad. Okay, is everybody done now? Is everybody done now? Done? Fuck no, baby, I ain't done. Hey, why don't you leave the girl alone? Bad night at Brown. Everybody's here to have a good time. Nobody's looking for trouble. What's the problem? - There's no problem, just leave the girl alone. You're right, man, I'm sorry, all right. Hey, let her go, what's the matter with you? Get up here and tell this guy you're sorry. You want me to tell this guy I'm sorry? You're always fucking embarrassing me. Okay, Jake. If you want me to tell him I'm sorry, I'll tell him. Hey man. Motherfucker! Hey, are you all right? Ah love, let us be true to one another, for the world which seems to lie before us like a land of dreams, so various, so beautiful, so new. So boring. What do you think the poet is talking about here? Yes Cindy. A day at the beach? Come on! I think he had a little more on his mind than that. How come this book ain't got no real poetry? And what's real poetry, Richie? You know, stuff that makes sense. Give us an example. Yeah, come on Richie. Come on, Richie, put up or shut up. You want a real poem? A real poem, okay. Okay, here it goes, an original. Disco sucks. Punk is dead. Give me rock. Or give me head. No way! Now wait a minute, Richie's right in his own way. What he's just recited is real poetry. It has a rhythm, it rhymes, and it has meaning. Now, according to this poem, what place does rock and roll have in this poet's life? Richie? I dunno, I guess it's real important. As important as what? As important as getting head. Sit down, Richie. Yeah. What do you think? Maria, what does getting head mean? Miss Young! I don't think I should be talking about that stuff in school. Just like doing it, right? Go ahead, Maria, talk about it, I give you permission. Vince, I'm talking to you, what's the matter, man? Well, I think it has something to do with sex. No! And what word rhymes with head? Bobby? Dead. Now, how do sex and death connect? Francine? Sort of like, till death do us part, like, sex and death last forever. Like love. - Aww. - Oh my god. Exactly. Okay, now we're talking about romance. I like that one. Okay, for tomorrow I want you to look through Chapter Five and come up with other references to love and death. Brenda? Can I see you for a couple of minutes after class? What? I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am about your sister. How is she? The doctors don't know anything. Brenda, I want you to know if you need someone to talk to, I'm here. Look, Miss Young. I know you mean well, you're a good teacher. But this has nothing to do with you. Stay out of it. Brenda, you can't take the whole world on by yourself! You see us maybe one or two hours a day. You don't know anything. Hey Vince-y. Jake wants to see you. Yeah, yeah sure. I'll be there in a couple of minutes. Jake don't like to be kept waiting, Vince-y boy. Yeah. I dunno Brenda, I don't know. Don't you worry about Jake. He ain't gonna do shit. I did good, didn't I? Real good? You did great. Hi Brenda. Would you mind, is it okay if I talk to you alone? What is it? I just wanted to tell you I really like you. I dunno, I guess 'cause you're exciting. Like it always seems like you're gonna blow up or something. I never know what you're gonna do, and I like that. - You are unbelievable. - What? Well, well. It looks like the little slut's at it again. Cut it out, Cindy, we're only talking. I know it's not your fault, Wes. Fuck off, bitch. All right, let's settle down. Let's settle down, everybody. Turn the radio off. Turn it off! Put that goddamn skeleton back where it belongs. Let's just settle down. Put her back in her seat, will you, and just sit down? Let's settle down, the bell has rung. Thank you. Now if I can just hold your attention for a minute, I'd like to take you over to the chart. As you know, the reproductive system involves many different-- What's going on, Vince-y? It's all over school, Jake. The girl we raped. Do you think she's gonna die? Everybody dies. What are we gonna do, Jake? We've been all through this, so just calm the fuck down! I mean she's a fucking retard, man. She can't even talk. Yeah, and the only way anybody's ever gonna find out is if Vince-y boy opens up his big fat mouth. Vince-y wouldn't do that. Would you? Hey Jake, you know I'd never do nothin' to hurt the Scars! Just forget about it. Now tell me where I can find that bitch that cut me. Well, since it's obvious that no one is prepared, I will simply have to go back and repeat yesterday's section on the ovaries. Miss Clark, you'll begin. I can't. You can't, why can't you? My parents don't think we should be discussing this kind of stuff in school. And what do they think we should be discussing in this school? That people should be taught to stay in their own place, and not try to pretend to be what they're not. Don't push it, Cindy. Especially when they have retards in their family. That does it! No Brenda. What are you gonna do about it? All right, girls. All right, stop that, girls! Now, I'm sorry about your sister, Brenda. The police are doing everything they can. But she shouldn't have been there in the first place. Fuck you! You're a tough little bitch, aren't you? I like that. But I don't give second warnings. So consider yourself suspended. I am never gonna get out of this place. Yes you will. Brenda, we're behind you a hundred percent. We're here. - Yeah, yeah. - We'll work it out. - Come on. - It's gonna be okay. - Don't worry. - All right, all right, let's get organized. Francy, you and I are gonna go pick up your dress. Shit, do I have to do it now? I can't handle it! If you don't pick up your dress, you're going to be walking down the aisle bare-assed. Brenda, we'll meet you guys at the MX club at 4:30. Then we'll go see Heather. Everybody got that? - Yes mother. - Got it. - Okay, come on now. - All right, we're coming. Hey kid, nothing's gonna ruin your big day. Okay? Francy, move your ass! I've gotta do some stuff for my mother! Okay, okay, I'm coming out! Ta-da! Oh god! Ho ho ho, this is hot stuff! Boobs are gorgeous! Perfecto! Es un fit perfecto! Maria. Francine, remember, we're all meeting at the MX, don't be late. Okay, I'll be there, I'll be there. Andale. Oh, thank you! Hey, you're just gonna scare her, right Jake? Would I lie to you, Vince-y? Slow down, baby! We'll meet you guys at the top. You're sure you're not gonna hurt her, right Jake? Isn't that what I said? Come on! No, no, please no! Where you going, huh sweetheart, huh? Hey, Jake, you promised! No, please, no! How do you like the view, huh? - No, don't, Jake! - No please, Jake! - Goddamn it, do it! - Please Jake, no! No, Jake! No, no! Here comes the bride. She's all drenched in red. Come on man, let's go. Come on. Come on, come on! You sick motherfucker! I hate your guts! You hear me? I hate you! Let me go! - Let's go! - Come on! I hate you! I hate you! You fuck! You're mine, you hear me? You're mine! Where the hell is she? I don't know, but visiting hours are almost over. Give the girl a break, will ya? She's getting married in a couple of days, she's allowed to be a little spacey. Oh, you should see her in this dress. Well, I'm getting a little pissed off. I don't like a woman to keep me waiting. Well, the way she cut up Jake last night, I wouldn't get her mad at me. Yeah, 'cause she's just liable to cut you up three ways. Long, wide, and frequently. Yeah, get down Stelly! Look, you guys stay here and wait for her. I've gotta go to the hospital. Heather? Heather? I didn't wanna do it. I mean, it all happened so fast, you know? Jake and Fargo, they... They know what it is to be tough. I'm just their friend. I just hang around them. But no more. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna hurt you. They just put me there. They just threw me on top of you. I didn't have a chance. I didn't have a chance. They went, all this time... No! Damn son of a bitch! No, no! Come on!

Too bad you're not double-jointed. Why? 'Cause if you were, you'd be able to bend over and kiss your ass goodbye! You do it Fargo, huh? You doing it? Yeah, yeah Fargo! We're both gonna do it! - Oh, oh Fargo! Quit fucking around, Fargo, where are ya? Where's the pussy, huh? Hey Fargo, what you doing man? Where's the pussy, huh? Hey man, quit fucking around, huh? What's-- Now it's your turn with the pussy. No, no! I have to go alone, Carol. I'll call you when I get back. No! Hey, come out here douchebags, open up! Come on, we gotta celebrate! Come on, we're gonna party! Hey, come on! You're next, asshole! Come on, bitch, you wanna piece of me? Come on! What's the matter, Jake? Did I get too big a piece of you? Oh, you're not gonna let me get away with it, are you? There's not much you can do about it, is there? Oh yeah, you better load it quick, Jake! God knows you're gonna end up just like Red and Fargo! Brenda! I didn't get you, did I? No, Jake. You didn't get me. But I'm definitely gonna get you. No! Oh my, I missed! And I did so wanna see you bleed to death. Oh well, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Oh look! No more arrows. But I'll tell you what. I've got some more in the car. Now don't go away. Cunt! See, I told you to stay where you were! Now look what you got yourself into! You know what you look like? You look like a pig in a slaughterhouse, ready to butcher. You ever wonder what a pig must feel like before they slit its throat or cut its balls out? It couldn't have been any worse than my sister must have felt. Or Francine. She was pregnant. Fucking bastard. It's not gonna be quick, Jake. What's the anger of two bitches think? You wanna cut me, come on! I am gonna tear your heart out and eat it. No place to go, baby! I'm coming for you, Brenda! Where are you! Brenda, baby! Send a backup. It's just not fair. There's no damn justice. Even if there were, we couldn't bring Francine back. But at least she knows, we made things right. No, Brenda. You made things right.
