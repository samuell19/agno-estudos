Your wife buy your underwear too tight or somethin'? Loosen up a little bit. Loosen up, man. Let me see what you got for me. Check it out. Man, what the hell is this shit? You oughta know, cop. You've got steel balls but no brains. You're right, I do have steel balls. Good morning, Captain. How's the wife and kids? Hey-ey, not too bad. You should try it some time. By the way, nice bust, Tyler. You okay? - You should see... - The other guy. Yeah. Hey, Tyler, guess what you just won? Hit me, man. What? An all-expense paid trip to Toronto. Toronto? What about Mexico where it's nice and warm? Coke is coming into Toronto and ending up in some of our fine Great Lake cities. Seems we've got a leak in our northern border. And my shoulders are just wide enough to plug it up. You got it. You'll be working with a Michael Reeds, Metro Vice, Toronto. He's also a loose cannon, so you'll probably get along just fine. We're sending you guys to a martial arts school. Say what? Don't worry, it's all part of your cover. Just read that. You'll figure it out. That's it. Whoa. It's all here. Let's see the money. Every cent. - Okay, load 'em. - I hate wasting time. Take them! Up against the wall! You're under arrest. Don't move, pal. Okay, we got 'em. Ah, it looks like we've got a problem. Mr. Lee, consider it solved. Thank you, thank you. Thank you for coming. I hope you'll enjoy our kung fu demonstration. These guys can keep each other company. I'll drive the goods down to the station. - See you later, guys. - I'm goin' down, too. Hey, hey! Hey! Please, don't stop on my account. 514, please come in. 514, please report. Please report. Master Pan, kindly accept a small donation for your worthy cause. We know who you are and what you do. Your money is very dirty! I don't want it. Foolish idiot! Now leave. Master Pan, you are much too old-fashioned. I don't know where you got your information, but I'm merely a businessman paying my respect to you and your cause. I won't be so generous next time. Come! Can I have your attention, please. Now boarding flight 92 and 19. Welcome to Toronto, Mr. Wilson. - Just call me Tyler. - Tyler. You look like your photo. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it's a compliment. The car is right this way. Check her out. Toronto's not so bad. What're you doing? No. - Give me that goddamn coat. - Get away from me. Give me the coat. - Give me the coat! - Stop. - Please, stop. - Go, go, go, go. Get in. Shit, I can't believe it. This is like New York. Help! Watch that van. Michael, you want me to drive? Do you mind? Bet you didn't think Toronto was this exciting. Betcha. Tell me about this Li character. I don't know much, but he's the key to this case. How do we find him? Mr. Li scouts martial arts tournaments for new recruits. That's why we're going to see Master Pan. Master Pan? He can get us into the tournament, and once we're there, we'll impress Li and get in. He is Li's enemy, so he would love to... he would love to have one of his students kick Li's ass. So we'll do the kicking. Come on, man, put the pedal to the metal. When are you gonna catch this guy? Why are you chasing him? Let's go. Stop being a backseat driver. Why don't you cut him off? He's got a gun. Holy shit. Hang on, this is it. Who taught you how to drive, man? You be quiet. Wait, Tyler. Let them handle it. I hate paperwork. This is definitely like New York. Nice apartment. Where should I put this bag? Ah, make yourself at home here. Thanks, I will after listening to that Beethoven crap. Beethoven what? You heard what I said. That wasn't Beethoven, it was Mozart, and it's not crap. Mozart, Beethoven, all of it's the same thing. Yeah? That's just like saying Michael Jackson, Hammer, same thing. I get your point. Hey, DEA guys are not authorized to carry weapons in Canada. You tell the bad guys that first. School's in. Looks more like a museum to me. Or a mausoleum. You must be Master Pan. I'm Michael Reeds. Tyler Wilson. - Yes, hello. - Pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. Show me what you can do. No problem. But I only demonstrate against an opponent. I can take anyone. Okay, knock me down. You're not ready to fight. These men are dangerous. Maybe kill you. You must learn eagle claw. Come. This is snake. This is tiger. But this... is eagle claw. What's this for? No choice. If you want eagle claw, first you must learn to fly. Run. Check her out. Is that what you call Canadian wildlife? She will be in a minute. What ya doin', man? Gettin' outta here. Just you wait. We continue at sunrise. Sunrise? Hey, bubblehead. Wake up, man. ♪ I hear ya callin' ♪ Now that's music. That's noise, man. Come on, man. Let's go. We gotta arrive on time. We gotta go dance with Master Pan. I bet you can't do this to Beethoven. ♪ I hear you callin' ♪ ♪ I hear you callin' ♪ ♪ Dance to the groove ♪ Come on, man, let's go. ♪ I hear you callin' ♪ ♪ I hear you callin' ♪ You. Wait. Watch me. Watch my demonstration. My student Tara will train you. Sounds pretty good to me. Now don't go anywhere. Sounds good, eh? You're the one who took her clothes and hid 'em. Mr. Wong and his boys are here. Oh, I see. You're looking well these days. Where's my money? Actually, that's why I'm here. I don't have it. You owe me $75,000. Yeah, I know. I can get it. What do you mean, you can get it? I want it right now. Three weeks. Give me three weeks. The economy's down. You know how things are. Yes, the economy is down, and cash is hard to come by. Let's add a little interest and make it $100,000 total. $100,000? Next Friday, no more excuses. That's insane. That's business, Mr. Wong. Or do you want me to up my deadline? These guys are small potatoes. Pretty soon, we'll be playing with the big boys from Hong Kong. Mr. Fong Wai Hut just gave me a call a little while ago. He wants to join our association. Rice only when in training. I want a steak. Yeah, I'll take two steaks. Wait. And find some ass. Mr. Li, there is good news. We have booked a location for the tournament. And everything's being prepared. It's gonna be a great tournament. Ah, that's good. Make sure all those invitations are sent out, huh? We need to find some good recruits this time. It's about time. I'm sick and tired of being surrounded by a bunch of punies. No, no, no. Eagle claw. Eagle, eagle. Use eagle claw. Please, sit down. I received a message, tournament's in just one week. You're not ready, so I think you're waiting for next tournament. Would you excuse us for just a moment? I didn't come all this way to be put on hold. I came here to do a job. Are you with me or not? For once, I'm with you. Come on, let's kick some ass. Master Pan, how much time do you think you need to get us ready? I think three weeks. Then triple our training schedule. Because we're entering that tournament no matter what. Ya! Now you. Well, are you getting anything worthwhile recorded today? Counselor Cranston. Nice work, Linda. Let's record. That's my girl. She loves her work. Ho. When you go to the tournament, show this. Well, I guess this is goodbye. Remember, eagle claw. There he is. - Who's that? - It's Mr. Li. Ah, good evening, mate. Ann, how are you tonight? Hmm? Great. First fighter. Ready. Fight. The winner! Hey, great fight. Get set. Ready, fight. The winner, Sung Ho! Heads. Bow. Ready. Fight. Winner in his first fight! You can have 'em both. You'll need 'em, asshole. Bow. Ready. Fight. The winner! The winner! Here's your $100,000, you bastard. Watch the other guy. - Let's go. - I got him. Move it. You're a dead man. Okay, you two. Scram. Move it. Let's go! And you, you two heroes. Over here. Well, you two were very impressive tonight. I guess I owe you a favor. I own a club not too far from here. I could use talent like yours. What kind of a job? Well, let's just say that it gets more rewarding as time goes on. If you're interested, meet me at pier 15 tomorrow. Noon. Do you want any grapefruit juice? No. You got a couple beers? Shots on goal were... Hey, is something wrong with your television? All we have on here is hockey. He dragged the puck in. Point check and even... Second period, one nothing... Best I can do. This is 6-9-6-9-8-2-3, please leave a message. Hey, Felix and Oscar. This is the Cheshire Cat. Have you guys made contact yet? Yeah. Yeah, we see him tomorrow about working at the club. Great. There's one other thing you should now be aware of. I'm faxing you a photo of an agent we've had inside of Li's gang for several weeks. Agent Cassandra Hubbard was assigned to observe and collect data on Li's contacts. Problem is, Hubbard has missed her last three report dates and is now classified as R-3. R-3? She may have jumped sides. In the fall, Toronto is beautiful. I admired your control and power in Hong Kong for many years. People respect you everywhere. I can bring that same circle of influence - to our partnership. - Mm-hmm. My international connections are unlimited. No doubt. I understand there is a small matter I can help you with, huh? Yes. I wish to stay here permanently and arrange for my corporate colleagues to join me here. But I now face a deportation order, and that damn immigration does not look favorably upon the applications of my associates. Well, I'm sure I can help you with that. Ah, good, Mr. Li. I'll leave it in your capable hands. You won't regret it. I'll see you later. Hold it right there. It's all right, Niko, let 'em pass. Well, have you made up your mind? We're interested. What's the job? Security. And what's the pay like? $5,000 a week. Each. For security? You heard what the man said. When do we start? Immediately. That's right away. You mean we're going lower? Depends upon your point of view, Mr. Wilson. An unfortunate necessity, gentlemen. I don't approve of weapons. And why not, Mr. Li? Someone might get hurt. Mr. Li, where have you been hiding? Amazing. I definitely don't think we're in Kansas anymore, Toto. Welcome to the future, gentlemen. Exclusive adult playground. Designed for the hardworking... - Mr. Li. - Elite. Multi-cultural, of course. And over there, you see that big fellow with the busty blonde? Well-known magistrate. One of my best customers. - Excuse me, Mr. Li. - Cassandra. Ah, well now. Ah, Cassandra will take over. So, what's it like working for a big shot like Li? If you expect to last more than five minutes with Mr. Li, I suggest you show him respect. The training center and hotel suites are this way. Would you follow me, please? Class, take your stance. Any time you want a lesson, just ask. Mr. Li would like to speak with you. Your rooms are right down the hall and you'll find more appropriate clothing there. I think I'm gonna like it here. Me too. We've got to get this one guy who can help us solidify our relationship with Fong Wai Hut. Who is it? Henry Dobbs. Superior Court Justice. If he agrees to help us the immigration board can't do a goddamn thing about it. He can veto any deportation order and streamline application orders of others. I love this country's version of democracy. When do we go see him? I tell you what to do. Tonight, I want you to let him feel the pressure of my superior court. I don't like these clothes. - You look good. - Hello, Tyler. - I'll be back. - That is quite a nice suit you're wearing. So, what do you do around here, anyway? I help Mr. Li. Well, everything going well? She's been most helpful, yes. Mm, I'm glad. Come, darling. Good night. What are you doing with Mr. Li's woman? Just learning the ropes, pal. If you don't want a rope around your neck, you'll leave that girl alone. That's one warning. That's one more than you're going to get. Okay, put the money away. So, who ran a security check on those two guys? Are you questioning their loyalty, huh? After the way they saved me? Okay, you're not satisfied, check 'em yourself. You pig, you got nothing on me. You can't charge me, Blondie. Communications, Constable Link speaking. - Con. - Hi. Can we talk? What's up? I got a couple of faces I would need a security check on. Sure, um, fax them over to my home. Thanks. What? Who the hell are you? Ah! Fong Wai Hut will not be deported, and his friends will be invited into this country. Do we understand each other? Hmm? Do we understand each other. Yeah. Good. Fong Wai Hut. Don't forget. Excuse me. Later. You just scared her away. She's not goin' anywhere. Come on, 27! Red, 18. How would you like to make your money back? All right. See that guy? Bet him. Excuse me, sir. How was your luck today? Better than yours, pal. Stop! He's dealing. Feeling lucky? - Very good. - Good. Garret, you take good care of these men. I'm not available. You look pretty available to me. Then get your eyes checked. You can't talk to me like that, you bitch. Look, why don't you come with me and I can get you any girl you want, okay? But I don't want any other girl. I'm Li's girl. I just want you. You understand? Yeah, fuck off! Bitch. No! Hey. Ow! Help! Cassandra, you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Cassandra. I heard you had some problems. Are you all right? Yes, yes, I'm fine. Nothing your new man here couldn't handle. Oh. Yes, my new man. A hero again, huh? I like that. Hey, you look a little tired. New jobs always knock me out, especially ones with so many attractive women. Yes, yes. Come, my darling. - Ah! - Cassandra. Would you mind getting off me? I had come to say thank you. I'm sorry, but you could have knocked. This was a bad idea. Wait. I wanted to talk to you about our boss. Mr. Li? No, our other boss. Li's got the whole place heavily wired. Jack suspects you've crossed over. What? Oh, that is rich. That shows a lot of faith, huh? Have you tried to make a phone call lately? Look, my ass is the one that's on the line. I can't get away from Li long enough to make a phone call from a safe phone. Either he or one of his goons watches me 24 hours a day. What have you got so far? Well, I've seen a lot, so if charges are laid, I can testify, but not much hard evidence. Damn it. And Jack thinks I crossed over? You were sent here just to check on me? Tyler and myself were also supposed to find out about his supply lines and contacts. Oh, Tyler too, huh? That is great. Look, the two of you can just take over the whole thing. Okay? I just wanna get outta here. It's been hell here. We're here to help you. Oh, yeah. You did sorta save me tonight, didn't you? Purely a selfish gesture. But didn't you say you came to thank me? Oh, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Attention. Outside crescent kick. Ready? Go. Go. Go. Change. You're lookin' more chipper than usual. What'd you do last night? Nothing unusual. I can imagine. All you have to know is, she's still on our side. I can't believe it. You slept with her and now you think she's okay. If I say she's okay, she's okay. You paranoid or something? No, you're just unprofessional. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it. Niko. Niko and my driver will take you on that assignment I told you about yesterday. Routine pickup. We're here to see Big Charlie. Open it. - So where's the dynamite? - Right here. Check 'em out. Give him the money. We don't have a lot of time, so why don't you have your men start loading our truck. Load 'em up. You ever handle one of these before? You tell Li I can get him as many as he wants. This is 9623, shots fired. Nine Hannah. Requesting backup. Powerful kick, eh? It's all clear! Freeze! Police! You set us up! Next time motherfucker, you got a. Let's get out of here! Leave me alone! Go! Go! Let's go, let's go, hit it! Oh, no! Look out! Duck! Damn! - Hang on! - You're crazy! Get him! Tyler, I heard you had some bad luck. But Niko said you handled it pretty well. Just doing my job. That's good, that's good. You know, I'm sorry about your friend Michael being arrested, but I'm sure I can get one of my judges to release him. In the meantime, you take the rest of the day off. - Pretty firm. - Thank you. Uh, Tyler? If there's anything you need for your comfort, just ask, baby. Leave us alone for a minute. You have a nice day? Li's already making arrangements for your release. I don't like it. - If your cover's blown... - It isn't. No one suspects a thing. Are you willing to bet your life on that? It's too risky. I want you out. No, we're just starting to get close with Li. It's about time you did something to keep in shape. Sharon, what are you doing here? That biker deal was really wild. Just thought you could use a massage. Sounds good to me. That was some pretty heavy driving. I'm just doing my job. Really? And I thought you were doing it just for me. That's all I need to ensure that everything goes as I planned. I spent years gathering this incriminating evidence against politicians as they came into power. Blackmail. Precisely. I'm looking forward to the merge of our two organizations. So am I. Let's have a drink to that, shall we? Khan. - To the future, Mr. Li. - To the future. Are you sure? His name is Reeds. He works in another division. Narcotics undercover. I knew it. And the other one? No record. They're together, I can feel it. Thanks. Yeah, you owe me. Here's to our merger. One of the guys is a cop. Uh, some bad news? Oh, not at all. Everything's fine. You wanted to see me? You think you can fool me? You insult my intelligence. Now you, you become my insurance policy. Aw. Did I hurt you? Take him away. And you? Go bring the other one down. I want this man punished. Now, which one of you will be the luck one, huh? Uh... No, you. You punish him. If that's what you want. Hold this. Come on, boy come on. Come on, come on. That's it? Let me finish him. You be good, baby, you be good. But I want him alive. You can't bargain with a dead pig. - Come on, Mr Wilson. - Hey. - Where's Michael? - Li has him locked in the basement. Son of a bitch. We gotta move in fast, though, looking like they're moving him. We still have to get the blackmail folders out of the safe first. I'll get Li out of the office, you be ready to move in. Fire! Fire! What? Fire? Yeah, I'll be right there. Can I help you? Mr. Li asked me to put my necklace and ring in the safe, and you know, I just can't seem to unhook it. You think I'm stupid? He gave me the combination himself. Okay? If you don't believe me, why don't you just go ask him? Let's just do that. All right. What's the rush? I mean, you really are very handsome, and now that I've been as close to you, I've always kind of wondered what you smell like. - Yeah, you smell good. - Yeah? Uh-huh. You're so big. And I've always had this thing for really, really big... Nothing at all. Just a few rags. Go back to the casino and enjoy yourselves. Okay. Get the bus boy to clean it up. Come on. Uh, come on what? You belong to Mr. Li. Oh, well. You know, the way I see it, is that I don't belong to anybody. We need to hide it. I'm trying. Walk. Go, go, run! Stop them! Freeze! Or she dies. So, Cassandra, your true colors finally show. You're not even worth it. Take them away. All right, everybody. Let's get back to it. Have fun. Drinks on the house. See you later. Nice of you to join me. It wasn't my idea. We did grab as much as we could before they got us, so... Where is it? Slipped it inside the ventilating system. With the security in this place, I think that's our ticket out of here. - It's too narrow. - For you, but I could fit. Hey, Tyler. Tyler. Can you grab my right earning? Just yank it. Oh, god. Drop it into my hand. - Got it? - Okay, got it. Got it. Great. - So where is it? - It's in the south entrance. Got it! God, I'm good. Michael, I didn't expect to see you here tonight. Here it is. Photographs, files, computer disks, everything you need to nail Li. Now that's good work. Now we can start to dismantle his organization. Where are the two DEA agents? - They're locked up. - That does it. I'm calling in an emergency task force. No. If I could go back before Li discovers them missing, I can get them out. No way! Mike, you've done your job. Tyler and Cassandra could be killed. You're too close to this. We deal with hostages all the time. You got your orders! Well, what have we here? Okay, okay! Mek-ho. - Tyler's in trouble. - What happened? Li's holding him and a woman prisoner and if we don't get there fast enough, they're both dead. Li's time has come. Let's go! Find those two bastards and kill 'em. Hi. Do you want to play a little game? You guessed that one right, babe. It's called sleep time. Psst. Come on, come on. Now that I've got Henry Dobbs cooperating with us, it'll only be a matter of days before your so-called deportation orders are rescinded. Are you sure there won't be any more problems? It seems you have your hands full just watching your own staff. Listen, I guarantee you everything is under control. Well, it better be. Being arrested with all this incriminating evidence could put us both away for quite some time. Hey, I don't want to hear any of that. Nobody's gonna arrest me. This building is completely wired. Let me show you. See? Even the smallest piece of evidence will be completely destroyed. Give me nine minutes and then make your move. Come on, let's finish it! I will. Come on, faster! Now you die, you son of a bitch! Now... tell us who sent you and what you know. ♪ Put your money down ♪ Took you long enough. I think they got Cassandra tied up in Li's office. Mr. Li. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Mr. Li. I'm going to end your evening with a bang. We're stuck. He's got the explosives. Find that piece of trash and destroy him. No mistakes now. Clear everyone out of here. Go! Clear out! Let's go! Move! Get everybody out of here. You go there. All right! You get Michael's car and meet us - down in the parking garage. - Okay. What the hell's going on? You call this a... - I'm not through yet! - Get off me! Mr Li, your casino business is finished! You'll never leave here alive. You gambled and you lost, now you pay the price. Come on, get 'em! Show time! Come on, this way. Come on. - Come on. - I am! System is now engaged. Reed, go! Four minutes until termination. Evacuate the area. Three minutes, 30 seconds until termination. What's that? This place is about to blow. Where's Michael? Where's Lau? They must've gone after Li. They could be anywhere. Let's just hope they get out. Let's go to the garage. Are you looking for someone? Where's Michael!? Just get them out of here. I gotta go back and find him. - Is it time? - Just get him out of here! Three minutes until termination. You said you don't approve of guns. For other guys. Come on. Come on. Come on, you bastard! Come on. Come on, come on! Now I'm gonna give you that lesson I promised you. Two minutes until termination. Okay. You win. Kill me. No, that would be letting you off too easy. Kill me! Thirty seconds until termination. We don't have a lot of time, partner. You boys need a lift? - Come on. - Come on, go, go, go. Drive, go, go. This place is gonna blow! Let's go! Move it! Push it! Come on! Let's go! Get down, it's live. Come on, push it. Bitch. You'll hear from me. I swear, you'll hear from me. As much as I hate to admit it, nice work.
