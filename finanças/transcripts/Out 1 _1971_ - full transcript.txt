EPISODE 6 FROM PAULINE TO EMILIE Have you seen this man? He wears a big coat. Have you seen him? Thanks, anyway. I was wondering if you knew this man? No, I don't know him. Could you help me please? Do you recognise this man? - No, I don't know him. - You've never seen him... thanks. Excuse me, I'd like to ask you a question. Do you recognise this man? - No? You've never seen him? - Never. In the morning in the metro? He was wearing a big jacket? - There was a man like that, but I'm not sure. - What did he look like? Do you remember? No? Thanks. Oh well? You didn't see a young man, with quite a big head? Excuse me, I'd like to ask you... if you've seen this man on the metro? - You've haven't seen him? - No. Did you want to speak to someone? I wanted to see the person in charge... I'm a journalist from Paris-Jour and I'd like some information about your work? - Oh, Paris-Jour? - Are you in charge? Yes, that's me, Thomas Otlay? Is Paris-Jour taking an interest in the theatre now? Not exactly, but I would like to know what play you're putting on? - Aeschylus. - Which play exactly? Prometheus. Do you know it? Vaguely - he was the guy who gave men fire? That's right. Sit down. - What do you want me to tell you? - Why Prometheus? Why Prometheus? Oh my God... That's rather a long story to tell in a few words? Why not? Why not Prometheus? Prometheus is a vast and ancient myth... it's been a long time since it was last performed... I think we can bring something of today into it? What I mean is... behind Prometheus, are there any meanings? Yes, there's a great deal of meaning? I can't tell you all that quickly? Through these movements, these words... are you trying to express... something different? You're everywhere, aren't you? Do you know each other? For you is Prometheus not the? the starting point for something you want to express that's more? a different message, or something like that? No, overall Prometheus is a fairly coded work... it's something extremely complex... and I'm trying to shed light on it through the things I know? ?There met thirteen men marked by the same feeling, endowed with enough energy to remain faithful to the same thought... sufficiently honest not to betray each other... sufficiently honest not to betray each other, profoundly political... enough to hide the sacred ties that bound them together... sufficiently strong to place themselves above any law... and lucky enough to have succeeded almost always in their designs... who had run the greatest risks, but kept their defeats silent. Fear could not touch them, not before the prince... not before the gallows, not before the innocent. They had accepted themselves as they were, irrespective of social prejudice, criminals no doubt, but remarkable for... some of the qualities that make great men... and recruited only among the elite of men?? Why are you reading me that? It's Balzac's The History of the Thirteen? I know it. Why? What makes you interested in it? I find the ties that bind these men... who decided to hold the whole of society in their hands... - ...absolutely remarkable? - Interesting, but it's nothing to do with Prometheus? I mean... Prometheus... - The History of the Thirteen? - I don't see the connection? It amuses me because it's something... I read when I was very young, and it led me to discover ... a game called the Thirteens game... it's a card game?. a game of patience. A game of patience? You can play in one hand. What is it exactly? It's very simple? You take the cards, you count them? - Don't you know? - I'd like to see ? You want me to show you the Thirteens game? I'd like that. Here are the cards? You count one, two? thirteen, it's the king? The number you say must never be the card you turn up. - Have you ever won? - No, not completely. It's quite hard to play because you haven't much hope of winning? Can I try? Wait, no, that's not what I want, it's that one, look? ?I think Pierre is a bit cross with me, as though I'd broken the pact?? - That's pretty serious. - That's what gives him his charm? Pierre's charm? - What? - His force. - Do you know Pierre well? - Yes I know him well. What's he like? - He's? a charmer! - Not with everyone.,, - He's never had much effect on me? - You haven't seen very much of him... you've just seen him in passing. I've met him two or three times? He's an extraordinary person... someone who takes you like that? who gets right inside you and then? you realise you've been totally manipulated? it can go very deep, it can kill you? He's a little boy too? that's why he's capable of anything. If Igor had really gone to Mexico? and even if something had happened to him... I'd have heard after six months. - Not necessarily. - I think... if Pierre and Igor had fallen out? I suspect Pierre? You suspect Pierre of being behind Igor's disappearance? In reality, yes. - That's serious! - Have you seen him recently? No, not very recently? In fact I don't see him any more? But you understand? ?Broken the pact?? If Pierre really believes that Igor has broken the pact? I don't really know what that means, but it's very serious anyway? What's in the other one? - I don't find it very interesting? - Yes, the Thirteen? Pierre is capable of anything... of crushing his father, mother, son, anything? It's more complicated than that?. What would it matter to him, to make someone disappear? Perhaps I'm going a bit too far? You are, but at the same time, why not? It's late for these children? Do you think they understand this conversation? You know children are so receptive? No, they don't understand. I'm sure that Pierre is a bastard. - No, he isn't. - I'm sure of it. It's too easy to say that. Maybe he is a bastard? Igor also talks about Pierre's charm that gives him his strength... you haven't seen enough of him... or you didn't let yourself be spellbound? So he's Mephisto? You two were very close. Very. What do you think of Thomas? Thomas is my third baby! I think Thomas is also a bit? he can be just as ?Mephisto?? You know he brought the children a tortoise? You should examine it. It might be bugged? Bugged! You know, the boy who was in the shop? - Yes. - He followed me... and he spent a long time talking to Thomas. - He's a weird guy. - You told me he was deaf and dumb? He talks perfectly well and? I know he speaks... Perhaps he's sent by Pierre? - I could imagine something like that. - Anything's possible. It's possible that's he a little deaf... - Or maybe he's just a little madman? - We don't know. Excuse me, Monsieur. Aren't you a famous mathematician? No, a physicist? - No. - No, a champion, right? No. A singer? Is that it? But I do know you, wait? You're an artist? You wouldn't be Mr. Warok by any chance? What if I was Mr Warok? Who are you? Let's pretend you are Mr Warok... then pretend I'm student Fr?d?rique. And if you were a student, you'd be a student? Well, listen... I'd like to ask you something. - May I? - Of course. - Can I sit down? - Of course. Do you think that today we can still do dialectical art? That's a big question. - What do you think? - What do I think? I've got an idea about it, but I'm more interested in yours. I don't know. If you say dialectical? what would you say about it? What definition, what? Mine's a bit marxist. Sure? I wanted to ask you? dialectics, the other... what might its role be... in a sect, for example? - A sect? - Yes. A sect or a group of people who live and work together? But why a group of people who live and work together... - ... for what goal? - That depends? there are lots of sects Perhaps you know of one? Certainly? We know they exist? - Do you belong to a? - No! - Would you like to belong to a? - That's different... I might, yes, just to see. To do what, exactly? Maybe there are some that want to? who've had enough of being ordered about and say... it's our turn and go for it. So they become conspirators and work together. Do you know people who belong to a sect? Or are friends of yours, planning to? Not exactly... I think I've got a friend who's in one. I've seen some letters? Letters to him, with names and there's like a code, you don't understand... and they talk about things? it's really secret? Does your friend belong to an organisation you would regard as secret? But he leaves papers lying around? They're not lying around. They were hidden? I went through a few things? Are you just curious, or do you feel drawn to this? I bit of both. It's something I keep thinking about... making suppositions on this and that. I suspect everyone. Perhaps I'm part of a secret society, perhaps you are? I'm not yet, I'd like to be? I'd have to be introduced, I expect you need... a card or something. Do you think there's an entrance exam? An exam, no, but They don't take just anyone. - Would you be ready? - I'm sure. I think that if the aim is so there's no one above to tell us what to do... Shit! I'd like to go and be free, I could do whatever I liked. Being on top rather than underneath? Right. But then other people would create secret societies with the aim of? In that case it's not good at all? Then we have to fight. I'm a little skinny but I know judo. You're naughty, you talk about dialectics we settle that... and then we're talking about secret societies. Aren't you interested in them? I find them mildly amusing? I'm astonished at the things you're saying. What do people usually talk to you about? I've got a suggestion for you, I belong to a secret society? - Do you think I'm being serious? - You never know? It might be true? but I don't believe you. Let's imagine that we form a secret society? How? Who with? We?ll get some paper... and make a list of fifteen people... who could be in the society? - And then? - We can't accept just anyone. We take people in different areas... who understand each other, who are a bit hard... and then off we go. Then we go and see each of the fifteen people and we say? I don't know... We say, ?You can do this, you can do that? and then we meet up... everyone has their own tasks... That's how it is in politics. - What will we do? - That depends... That depends on the group, what kind of group we set up. Then let's choose a group. There's you, there's me... What do we want? We want power or we want money. And then... If you had to choose, power or money? Maybe both, but in reality I'd rather have money... because money gives you power. And with power... With power you get money. That's dialectics, isn't it? We'll get there in the end? Excure me! I'm looking for this man, have you seen his face? No, are you doing an investigation? - Why? - It's a game. Look carefully at this face. I'm studying it from three different angles, reflection... imagination, and then this face? You can look at three parts in a face... the forehead is imagination... the chin is reflection? Don't talk to Georges about it. What most interests me in Thomas's work is? the hidden meaning? what he's trying to express behind the words... behind the gestures... the secondary meaning. It's the language of birds - - ...you see what I mean? - No, not really. The language of birds... is a language of rebuses, of hieroglyphs... which enables... one who is initiated, a companion, a sage, to be addressed... directly... in a kind of universal language... that speaks directly from one unconscious to another... hides its meaning and never enables the uninitiated to grasp it... even if it appears right before their eyes. - Do you see what I mean? - Yes... but I don't think it corresponds to what Thomas is really about. Certainly, Thomas is.. He has an element of mystery, but? as in anyone there are shadowy areas? Where we're dealing with the great mystery... a search for the absolute. What I like about him is? is his respect... for the freedom of others... and his personal search... which remains, whatever relationships we have. I have a fairly personal relationship with him that remains secret? he's a man... he's someone who? through his work... beyond the actor... really tries to attain the human being. It has been very important for me, meeting him. I'm gald... each of us have been able to preserve... our own part of ourselves, which I call shadow zones. We have nothing more to say to each other. Do you know him? Do you know this man? Do you know this man? Does he live around here? You don't know him then. He realises he is all powerful, and starts to sing. It's a spell. Do you know the Thirteens game? It's a long game of patience. That doesn't mean I've won? I've got another deck here? These photos are no use anyway. We don't know what time he takes the metro... we don't know where he lives, we don't know anything! This undertaking... is crazy. We should go to the police? Maybe Max has found something? She's gone to Porte de Vanves. - I remember, he changed twice. - That rules out plenty of lines! We're there? - We can rule out loads? - It can only be the south? Those exercises totally wear me out. I don't know if it was the same for you in the beginning. - Tiring, when you're not used to it. - Even when you are! But you feel good afterwards? Yes, it cleans you out, which is good? I don't know if you've noticed... but Prometheus has gradually disappeared? - It was already happening. - I've been thinking... we haven't mentioned him for three days. We asked Sarah to come to talk about Prometheus... and she's got rid of him altogether. But he's still there in a way. - I don't feel him any more. - He's vaporised. Would you believe it? - You seem to be pleased about it. - No, but in the end maybe he wasn't? - He was too much! - Maybe he wasn't completely indispensable. The important thing is the resonance it has within you? - Pour me a little... - You want some wine? Have you got any spirits? - What would you like? - I'd like a drop of vodka? - It's in the fridge... - I'll get it. No matches! - Look in my purse. - No Prometheus... no fire, no matches? Perhaps it's a disaster then? The more I think about the boy who came as a journalist, it bothers me? The way he approached me... it was a kind of provocation? - I'd like to talk to Pierre about it. - Really? It's not natural? there's something in it that worries me? Getting the Thirteen book out and showing it to me like that? That young man is a visionary. - Want a little? - No thanks, I'm fine. - Are you all right like that? - I'm fine, yes. Is this a game? It's lots of things. First of all it's this... And then this? Perhaps? this with... something like this? that comes back... goes here... and then... between the two... like this. Do you see? That really is the end of the line. Stay cool, Lili! I'm petrified? What's up? The shop's blown, for us. - Not definitely? - Yes, I got a call this morning. I've had two or three very suspicious calls... and then there have been people dropping by in the last few days? Why didn't you tell me? I haven't seen you. I've got to talk to you? I was expecting a guy today... but apparently he's been intercepted. You've got to help me? - What do I need to do? - You know what I mean. I'm really sorry, but it's the only possible way? But supposing another guy comes to collect his passport? It won't be the right one! Anyway, he comes in, I see him. So... I bring him in here, I get him to sit down. You get him to sit down if he's not the right guy? I've got things to do today? I've got to do the inventory, so I need quiet? Tomorrow morning, OK? Whenever you like? Anyway, there's no one here. - Lorenzo sent me? This way! - Sit down. - Hello. No, sit here. I've come for the papers. I've got a bit of a problem? the guy hasn't turned up? I'll wait. - Will he be long? - I don't think so? Go and get his suitcase. I'm coming! They'll take everything away? they'll come for him too? - What time? - This evening? Good! The papers? - Can I walk you home, Pauline? - Not today. I won't let you go if I can't walk you home! Let go of me! - I won't let go! - All right... No further than this! Bye, see you in a bit. - Are you going? - I'm going to the cinema. I'll make some coffee. I keep calling Lili. Have you got any news? She rang me this morning. - She's had to leave Paris. - Why? - I don't know? - I don't believe it! Then we'll stop. - How are you? - Good. You wanted to meet me here? Because I'm just over there? But they'll see you through the windows. Don't worry about that. I wanted to see you because... I've been thinking? First I wanted to know what you thought about the group. Do you regard it as completely over... or are we still keeping it alive? You know the way I see it? it's dormant. It exists as a memory. I'm asking you because? it's taken on a new reality... which I had no idea of to start with. I've realised that it's more important than I thought? The other day I was even visited by a guy... while I was rehearsing... and got out Balzac's book... and asked: ?What are the connections between The History of the Thirteen and Prometheus?? I was stunned? I thought it was a joke. Did one of you send him, or what? I acted dumb? I told him, I don't know... the only connection for me is a card game! - What sort of guy? - A regular guy. I've no idea who he is, he told me he was a journalist with Paris-Jour? I had no idea what to do. I even took out a deck of cards... to explain that Thirteen was a card game I played? But I was intrigued? I don't understand, this guy was making an investigation. I don't see the connection, it might be a coincidence? If it's a coincidence it's pretty odd? so I'd like to know if you talked about it to other people? No? not really? Honey Moon! Did you recognise me? What have you done? Cut your hair? Dyed it? No, I've changed my head? - Do you like it? - You look like a boy? Don't say that, I'll go all red! Where's your little dog? Don't talk about him! He's unbearable at the moment. Look, he bit me this morning. - Bad dog! - I've grounded him. - What is it? - Look... The young man I told you about? He's over there. He'd been out of circulation for a few days? He's come back? He's come back? he's all tanned?. Must have been off with the Greeks?. Yes, he's back to his old habits? There's plenty to read with that Suzie business? I can chat him up for you. - Bet you can't! - You'll see. Eat my croissants, I won't say a word. You're not going to eat them all by yourself? You've got a lot of papers there. Old slag! ?Former lady of the night, lived like a pauper and died, aged 73, on a heap of gold.? Some people have all the luck! I'd like a heap of gold, wouldn't you? You know that's all rubbish. What do you know? I know! There are more important things in the pipeline? Really? Things in the pipeline? My croissants, my fags? That's how the big jobs start? You know? If you want to succeed in life... you've got to know how to get organised... know how to take risks, not be scared. Then at the end... there's a pile of money waiting? Just keep talking. I'm seeing the others this evening. If you're interested... I could slip you a few tips? See you here at the same time tomorrow? Sure, off you go. Like a memory. What about Lucie? Has she said anything? My relationship with Lucie is mainly professional: she's the legal consultant to my group... so we do talk? but for the last two years... there hasn't really been anything to suggest... that there's an active group somewhere... or something organic? I could be completely wrong, but? Have you talked to Pierre about it? Pierre, no I haven't seen him for a while and? In fact, I haven't seen him in a long time... I haven't had a real conversation about it with him. For me, it's a link that exists but isn't exploited? We'd need a sort of anchor for it to turn into reality... and I don't think it's got one? I think that's a shame? we said we'd leave it for two years... we'd let it mature, we'd wait and see if it? And for me, I think about it all the time. I realise it's taken on a kind of? it's become something very? But don't you think it's a rather literary conception of things? - Absolutely not! - I haven't got much time... ... for daydreaming. You know my line of work, but... But I sense a kind of nostalgia in you? I realise that for me it's a means of action. We can't let our lives... go by without channelling things we really want to do, and... and with that anything is possible. It can take on extraordinary proportions and? the energies in us, we can't just abandon them like that? It absolutely must become reality. Yes, of course. But it can't be just words like that. Any group needs... rules... proximity... it needs to meet? We can't say that what we thought of is embodied in anything precise? I mean the link is kind of hanging, we might be able to activate it? Do you have something in mind? What I have in mind is... Once we decided it was going to exist... it did correspond to something very important? It didn't happen by itself! Why did we get together? It might be one way to bring about far-reaching solutions to our problems... and to give meaning to our lives... which would be completely committed to it and? We laid down the principles... but we never got any further! But the principles, you and Pierre formulated them in the most depth? But it happens, that the people who start something... aren't the ones that carry it through? I understand that you've lost the initial vision, but... but we'll help you get it back, but? Because, there's Pierre? You were the dreamers? Do you think there's anyone else in the group who has this? desire to put it into practice? I've felt the last time I saw Sarah, I felt it strongly in her? Lili, well that's a bit complicated... but I can feel it in Lucie? I feel is very strongly in Lucie. Before Igor disappeared... he definitely had it too? Igor, he hasn't disappeared. You know how he operates. He's off doing something? - I'm not worried about Igor? - Nor am I. Anyway we should all get together? We should look at it again? I'm not against it? but Lucie plays her cards close to her chest? she doesn't seem like someone... who wanted to be involved in some action. Maybe you're right. I've not had a lot of time to think about all that? But I'm not against it. And apart from that, anything else? You know I started Prometheus... it was Prometheus that made me? I realised that I can't find Prometheus... and I wonder if I haven't made some kind of link... between The History of the Thirteen and Prometheus. And the real Thirteen, for me, it's Prometheus in a way? - He's a symbol of the Thirteen. - You have to spell that out! Why is Prometheus symbolic of the Thirteen? He's a symbol because... It's the way for us to commit without knowing the ultimate end or goal? but what matters in my work, is first of all to do something. And then, through that work, you find out what the goal is? I'm discovering it through talking about it... I realise, between Prometheus and the Thirteen? I have the feeling that we? to put it bluntly... We can change is something... that's nailed down, that's Prometheus, that makes a link... and we can open things up and show people? Things grow out of a decision made by some group... that's how things start to move. I'm looking for the connection? To me Prometheus symbolises? what is prevented... and with the group, we can find enough energy... to change things. Don't you feel... that this group, it exists in suspended animation... without having found its point of impact... and that the young man's visit... set you back on the path to something. The fact of being a suspect... ... creates the crime. Suddenly it appeared as something that really existed, whereas? - We can't say it really exists. - Not yet. But once it's been thought of, it exists? I'm at your disposal. What we need to do is see the others. Oh, the grant? Have you had any news? - Your grant? You've got it? - No, only part of it? How many parts was it going to be divided into? Two? They've given me the first half? - It's a matter of scheduling. - I don't know. But I can have a word with? Is it a matter of a late payment? - Should you have had it by now? - I should have had it, yes. Right, I'll have a word... ?Jum who saw them faint? Jum who saw them faint, passes the time that erased them... other thirteens have formed a strange crew? Thirteen to hunt the Snark... they encountered only the Boo Jum? who saw them faint, passes the time that erased them... other thirteens have formed a strange crew? - Hi, how are you? - Fine. You? - What about work? - OK, middling? And Lili? Lili's gone. - Where? - I don't know where. And the group? Gone too. At least, I don't know? It's over. Let's see. ?Two paths lie open before you? Thirteen the better to hunt the Snark? Place me where I should be... they only encounter the Boo? Holy was our ambition... Jum who saw them faint? at the harbour where you must leave... passes the time that erased them... a hand will guide your own? other Thirteens have formed a strange crew?? Snark, Boo, Jum!
