Hello? Where the hell is everybody? Woo! Save it. Where the hell is everybody? You know I just asked myself the same question. Hey, Cody, how you been? I've been in deep space so long I have no idea what it is. Well, you're here, and that's all that matters. Me? I've been hauling carbonite in the matterite system so long, I can taste it. You ever taste carbonite? I can't say that I have. Well, you don't want to. It's nasty. It tastes like dirty metal socks. That's nice, and as much as I would love to talk to you about this all I really want to know is what in the hell is going on here? I mean, where are the pilots? Where are the gamblers? Where are the women? Gone, gone, and gone. Hello, boys. Been a long time. Yeah, I'll say. You know, what happened? What's going on? The end of Andromeda. The pleasure planet is over. No, no, no, don't you say that. I traveled half the galaxy to get here. You said your business was fun. Well, I want some of that business. Hey, I wish I could oblige, boys, but the fun has run out. Whoa. Whoa. I don't get this. I mean, what's happened? Times change. People move on. Nowadays, it's all virtual reality and programmable dates. No one wants to do it the old fashioned way anymore. I do. Cody? That is why we're here. Whoa, I know what's going on. In a second, everybody is going to jump out and yell surprise. OK, I'm ready. Surprise me. Oh, man, this is bad. This is horrible. Mhm. Woo hoo! Hey, what the hell is going on? Just take a look around, Omar. It doesn't get any better than this? What? But where, how, why? I was just telling the boys it's over. People move on. The old ways are just not in fashion anymore. Nah, this isn't right. This place stands for something God. I mean, I lost my-- Hey! Well, I had a lot of good memories here. Yeah, that's true. You remember those Venetian girls that used to work here? Remember what they could do with a piece of fruit? I remember the time I was with the Saturn twins. I don't think I came out of the room for three days. Four days. Right. That's what I mean. This place is great. We can't let it go to waste. I can if nobody wants to work here. Take a look around I've got no girls. No girls, no space jockeys. No space jockeys, no business. Bye bye, Andromeda. We can't let this happen. It's too late. God. Look, it's over. This isn't right. I mean, we've got do something. It's over. Wrong, it's not over until we say it's over. We're pilots damn it. OK, we travel into deep space and come back again, OK. We've faced hostile aliens, Orion pirates. I mean, you name it, we either freaking blown it up or ran away from it, OK. And what do we get for all our troubles, huh? Some credits that we never get a chance to spend in the Alliance Bank and a few days R and R in Andromeda. And now you're going to sit here and tell me that Andromeda is no more. Forget it. I ain't going out like that. Who's with me? I am. He don't even know what he's talking about. Yeah, but, well, I'm with you anyway. Mabel, you still got that wormhole transport. It's a little dusty, but it's still work. How about the returns? Just take the pad with you when you go. Hit return. I haven't had a problem yet. Perfect. With that we can transport to any place in the galaxy. What do you say we go get some new girls for Mabel? Yeah. Yeah, I'm in with that. You've been in a vacuum to long. Yeah, but will you do it. Hell, yes. You boys really don't have to do this. Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't you worry, Mabel. We're going to take care of this, because I know where the women are the most beautiful and the most beguiling in the universe. Women, they write songs about. Women so pure that no man has ever touched them. The one planet that's off limits to any male. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Eros. Eros. Eros. Is this Eros? This is it. Excellent. So what next? Oh, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way. We'll meet right back here at sundown, and guys let's be careful. Just beaming here we broke about six intergalactic treaties. Six? Yeah, even though this planet's only colonized by women, they all don't get along. They've developed their own factions. They make up their own rules. They're completely autonomous. How do you know so much? It's a hobby. All right, let's get moving. And guys, try to avoid large groups, OK. You'll do much better one on one. But what happens in large groups? You'll get captured and tortured to death. Tortured. Move it. One on one is nice, but two on two is even better. All right, who's there? Cody? Jeter? Quit playing around. Hey. Hi, how's it going? OK, look, I know I'm not supposed to be here. I got lost. I just got lost, and I just-- oh, well, all right. That's more like it. Take me to your leader. But you are our leader. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I mean, you no harm. I come in peace. That's right. You can touch me. You can touch me. I won't bite not unless you ask. What the hell? Hey, how's it going? Hey, let me out of here. I'm a citizen of the Intergalactic Alliance. You can't hold me. I'm out of here. Great. No remote. This is nice. What the hell's going on? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just not feeling like myself. Kind of get that way when you're tied to stake you know. Hey, you're from the Tribe, aren't you? Back to nature. I envy you. Excuse me. What's that for? Hello, I'm speaking here. You're in the forbidden jungle. No man is allowed here. So you can talk. Tomorrow you'll be burned alive for your crimes. What crimes? Stupid man, trespassing. Hey, stop. You can't sacrifice me. I just got here. I can sacrifice you right now if I want. It makes no difference to me. OK. OK. Later's fine. Don't I at least get a phone call, a lawyer, anything? Well, go on. I'll be here when you get back. Great. If this is torture, keep it up. Our king must be anointed with the sacred oil before he's crowned. OK. Is this pleasing to His Majesty? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. How did I get picked to be king actually? It's written in the sacred scrolls that our king once banished will return. The one who walks as a man who walks into our village is king. So any guy that walked into the village could be king? Only the chosen one. Oh, right. Right. Right. OK, so what's your name? I'm called Roxy. Roxy? Roxy, I like that. So what do you do here, Roxy. I've been waiting for your arrival. Really? That's it. I've been trained by the holy sisters my entire life to serve the king once he returns. Wow, it must have been pretty boring waiting for me. The anticipation it's been terrible. I'll bet. I'll bet. So what did these sisters teach you anyway? Hello? Anybody? I have rights, you know. The Intergalactic Alliance planetary conference clearly states that no traveler traveling with an alliance base shall be imprisoned against his will. Now I don't want to have to get ugly on this, but my cousin, well, he's a lawyer. All right. Now that's what I'm talking about. Good morning, Mr. Jacobs, or can I call you Cody? Who are are? And what in the hell is going on here? Language, Cody. Language. What is this? I am prefect Alexa, the ruler of this sect, and you were caught trespassing in our territory. There are no men allowed. Why do you think I came here? There are clear warning beacons. The Galactic Alliance has honored our desire to stay isolated. I didn't think a little visit would be so bad. Is that right? What is that? A mob of anxious women outside this building. They've heard of your arrival and would like to see a man for themselves. Really? Well, bring them on. I'm anxious to meet them. You see, Cody. I can't let that happen. Leave us. Your presence here is causing quite a bit of a problem. Then send me back. It's not that simple. If I do that, the problem will still linger. And what problem would that be? Men are a disease. They infect us, distract us, and generally lower the standard of living. Correct me if I'm wrong, but without men there wouldn't be any women. It takes two to tango if you get my drift. Please, we perfected successful breeding programs eons ago. All we need from you is your essence of life. We get that delivered COD. Yeah, I can see how horrible we are. Is that why you can't keep your hands off me? I think of you as sort of a pet, a plaything. It's been a long time since-- never mind. I intend to prove to the population once and for all exactly how evil men are. You don't mind, do you? Please knock yourself out. Thank you. This conductor will read your brain impulses and transfer them to images. We'll see what's on your mind. My mind's an open book. That's what I'm afraid of. I'll be broadcasting your brain activity to the population. They'll see for themselves. Cody TV, I love it. So Cody, what brings you to Eros? I was just exploring a part of the galaxy I haven't been to. I'm a curious guy. I see. So you were just in the neighborhood, and what are your thoughts on our lovely planet? It's nice. It's a little too floral for my taste, but it's nice. Too floral? Wait a minute. I wasn't finished. Oh, you're finished. Tomorrow you'll be put on trial for insurrection, a crime punishable by death. You can't do that. Disgusting. Guard, take this beast back to his cell. Wait a minute. What about the kiss? You felt that. Hey, am I glad to see you. I couldn't get through to that other one. No see, that's not the thing to do. Listen to me. Could you just stop that for a minute? Don't do that. Now I'm getting pissed. You keep blabbering like that I'll kill you sooner. Finally, somebody speaks to me. Why were you in the forbidden jungle? Look, it's a long story, and I don't have a lot of time here. Could you maybe, the ropes? Uh, no. My name's Omar. I'm called Becca. Becca, that's pretty. Becca, listen? I don't mean to hurt anybody. OK. I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come down and check out the plant. See this is why we don't allow men here, because they lie every chance they get. OK. OK, fine. OK. I came here to try and bring back a couple of girls to planet Andromeda to the serve as party girls. Don't kill me. Thanks. Now strip. Pardon me? Well, if I'm going to save your miserable life I at least want to know what I'm getting for my slave? Slave. Hold on a minute. Strip or die. Well, when you put it like that. You'll do. What? Hey, where you going? Come on, slave. We have to leave before they kill us both. What's this? You carry. Let's go. This isn't what I bargained for. Move it. Your Majesty. Roxy. Is it time for another bath? Time for you to rule. All right, OK. Tell me what I need to do. You must sit-in judgment. When the women of our village are in dispute it is the king who decides their fate. Well, what did you do before I got here? We never decided our fate. Very well. So tell me what this dispute is all about? She stole my recipe. It was a family recipe, and I didn't still anything. The same ingredients, the same spices, how could you not steal it? It's a wonder the women of your house haven't dropped dead from starvation. She-devil. - Witch. - Hold it. Hold it. You don't need to fight. Can't we all just get along here. Come on. Recipes are very coveted in our village. To steal a recipe is a high crime, and to accuse another falsely is also a high crime. You people need to lighten up. Your Majesty. OK, I'll tell you what. You take your recipe, and go bake your pie. You take your recipe, and go bake your pie. You both bring your pies back here. I'll taste it. And who's ever is better, that's the recipe. You're as wise as you are kind. I do what I can for my people. You're kind. I must be dreaming. And I am not waking up anytime soon. Oh, great. It's you two. Go away. You got me into this. We have never seen a man before. Would you mind disrobing? Excuse me? Could we see all of you? We have heard stories of extra appendages. Hey, I do all right for myself. No complaints so far. Well, we would like to see for ourselves. Listen, I am not a meat puppet on display. Buzz off. So what did you two do before I came? Look. Hey, you got me, but you really don't-- Hey, don't you ever rest. We've got to keep moving. Yeah, well, how about carrying some of this crap. Maybe you wouldn't be in such a hurry. That's it. Look lady, I'm tired. I'm hot. I'm thirsty. OK, I'm not taking another step. You know what? Go ahead and kill me. OK, it's going to be better than this death march. I wish you'd make up your mind. I just needed to remind myself what I'm doing this for. Very well. You rest here. I'm going to go get us some berries. I'll be right back. Thanks. Thanks a lot. And that is how you handle a woman. That was fast, my sweet. Ah, we've already played this game. You! Thought you could escape me. It wasn't my idea really. Move it up. You know since we're out, what would be the big deal of just like letting me go. OK, I had this little remote pad with a lot of little buttons on it, kind of small, you know. The toy is in the cave. Well, tell you what, OK. I get my hands on that, I push a little button, and I'm out of your life for good. What do you say, toots? Move it. So I can take that as a yes? You broke our lives. You pay the price. I guess I'm going to take that as a no. All right. All right. Geeze. How much further? Quiet. Another charmer. How about a five minute break? Keep moving. Well, suppose I can't, you know. Suppose I just stopped. I just need a rest for five minutes. You know, I'm not used to all this walking. I'm a space pilot. Technology's made you weak. No argument. I'm a weak, pathetic excuse for a human being. For a man. OK, fine, for a man, you know. But for a society who shuns the all the evil that men do, you seemed as though you've come up with just as much evil. What do you mean? I mean, killing somebody, because they wandered into your sacred jungle. How advanced is that? Without the threat of death, men would be here. And what's the crime in that? We don't need them. We don't want them. Have you ever been with one? What? A man. Have you ever been with a man? No. Well, then how do you know we're so evil? It is written. Don't believe everything you read. Strip. What? Strip. I want to see this myself. What's a guy to do? Trader, prepare to die. God, will this ever end? What is it lunchtime? You gals cook fast. They're ready for you to judge them, your Majesty. So what is this recipe anyway? A simple, yet exquisite pie. Pie? All this is over a pie? Not just any pie. Here taste. No, taste mine first. Whoa, whoa, ladies please. Let's not start that again, OK. I have an idea. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe. Oh my god, that is bad. That's bad. You should be ashamed of yourself. That's-- OK. Oh, that's even worse. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Those are inedible. I can't-- are you trying to kill me? Roxy? Roxy? You're a false King. What? What are you talking about? A real King would never allow this in our sacred throne. No, you're a false King. Take him away. Wait a second, no. No, actually those pies were actually pretty good actually now that I'm thinking about it. Can I have another bite? We really need to stop meeting like this. You're causing me quite a bit of trouble. It's what I live for. Too bad you won't be living for long. What do you mean? I mean, I've met with the Arrows Tribunal. You've been found guilty of insurrection. Look. If there's a fine, I'll pay it. Just let me go, and I'll be on my way. The fine is your life. Excuse me? You're to be executed at dawn. You can't do that. My planet, my rules. Just because I'm a man? We've worked hard in this society not to have any destructive forces. And we live in peace and harmony. It's because there are no men that we can accomplish this. Oh, great. I'm sure you'll all be very happy. We are. As part of your sentence, you are granted one final request. Let me go. Afraid not. Fine, then kiss me. I'm sorry? Kiss me. It's my last request. If I'm going to die, I want the taste of your lips on mine. Please. Besides what harm can it do. You can live without men, right? One little kiss isn't going to change that. It's not that-- Coward. Pig. You know, this could work a lot better if I could use my hands. Of course. Now are you sure you don't want to rethink that whole execution thing? You're right. I should kill you tonight. Guard. This man has violated me. Prepare him for his execution. You are one mean bitch. Take him now. Well, this is just great. He's mine. He's mine. Ladies please, there's enough of me to go around. Silence Silence. OK. I challenge you. I accept. Ow. Ow, my hair. Stop it. Ow. Bitch. Whore. Another man on a planet. It's an epidemic. He is a false prophet. According to our laws, he must be put to death. And you being such a peace loving sect cannot possibly think of doing such an evil-minded act. Is that it? You have always been the one to govern with a firm hand. Govern him. But when I propose unity, you stay away. Don't you think that's a little bit of a double standard? I just don't want to deal with the man. He's gotten to you, hasn't he? No, I was with them, but it meant nothing. Right. Fine. I'll handle your dirty work for you. You can't throw me in here. I'm the king. Jeter? Is that you? Cody? What the hell happened? How'd you get caught? I don't know. I mean, one second I'm the kind, and the next thing I'm in jail. How about you? Long story. I'm not going anywhere. I only hope Omar can find us and bust us out. Hey Omar, knows his planet. He'll be here to rescue us. Trust me. I've had it. First, you tie me up. Then you untie me. Then Becca takes me away. Then Zula takes me away. I'm sick and tired of running. I don't know. You want to spear me? Go right ahead. Take your best shot, but I'm not going anywhere with either of you. We want to go with you. We're sick and tired of these primitive ways. Really? We're too stubborn to admit it to each other. Our tribe traveled too far away from society. We want to go back. Then why don't you just join one of the other sects on the planet? We miss men. A lot. Well, what can I say? Once you've had a taste of Omar, there's no going back. Well, actually, we think you're an excellent lover, but-- But. But? We've been so long without a man, we have a lot of making up to do. I see. You're not upset, are you? As a matter of fact, I might have a little proposition for both of you. Do one of you have that little remote pad that I was carrying? Excellent. You sure you want to go back? We're sure. All right, give me a hug. Come on. It's Andromeda. Mabel, say hi to your two newest hostesses. Oh, nice look. What is this place? Oh, don't worry. You're safe here. Are you hungry? A little earthy, but nothing a good sonic shower couldn't clean up. So where are the boys? I thought they were with you. You, mean they haven't come back yet? I thought I'd be the last one here. I was starting to think that y'all forgot about me. Something's not right. I told you guys not to go messing with that planet. Listen, will you take care of these two for me? I'll go back, and I'll find out what happened to Cody and Jeter. What if you don't come back. Well, you can automatically program this to return, right? Sure. OK, well, give me two hours. Wherever I am just beam me back. Hopefully, I'll be with the guys. Wish me luck. You have food for us. First a little shower fun. If I'm going to get customers back here, you two cannot be stinking up my joint. Excuse me, have you seen a man around here? Don't remind us. Our heart is breaking. That's got to be Cody. If you take me to him, I'm sure I could put in a good word for you. You did not understand. He and his friend are scheduled to be executed. That's not good. Can you take me to them? You'll be captured as well. Well, then let's make sure that that doesn't happen, OK. Come on. It's too late. But I've changed my mind. I mean, I've reinterpreted the laws. It doesn't work that way. You cannot control the way my people live their lives. I can when you give me that power. He's a man. You shouldn't have wasted your time. That is my decision to make, not yours. It was your decision. I'm proceeding with the executions. It's the only way we can keep our planet pure. Has it ever occurred to you that this poison you call man has effected all of us? We're no better than they are, archaic laws, idiotic rules, punishment by death. What kind of society is that? An orderly one. You are such a man. She was just so beautiful. I really thought we were going to rule together. Have you completely lost it? We were supposed to find party girls for the cafe. Did you forget? No, but we just assumed these girls were going to jump for us. We didn't even think to ask. How civilized is that? You know, they're right. All men are pigs. Now I've heard everything. Roxy. What are you doing here? I am so sorry for getting you into this. I was so arrogant. That's OK. You were just following your laws. Stupid laws. You were right. Jeter, who is that? What's going on? It's Roxy. She's come to say goodbye. We only have five minutes, my love. My love? Don't waste time talking. Take me. I must leave you now. I'm sorry I thought of you as a concubine. When did you think that? I mean, that's why we came here. We were going to take you back to Andromeda and make you a party girl. But I mean, you mean so much more to me, and now-- It's too late. Would this help me? My God, where'd you get this? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Let's go. Come on. We can get out of here now. I can't leave my people. Yes, you can. They won't miss you. Come on. Let's go. I can't, but you go. Save yourself. That would give me the most pleasure. Roxy? Go. Jeter, what's going on? I have the remote. Well, let's get the hell out of here. I can't leave her. You want to die? I don't. Forget about her. Come on. Widen the beam to pick me up. Let's do it. Roxy? Omar, get me out of here. OK. OK. Thanks. OK, let's go. I was never happier to see you guys in my entire life. Let's get out of here. Take us with you. I can't. Why? Because it's wrong. That a boy. But we want to be with you and only you. Really? Hey, you don't get many offers like that. But I'm a pig. We don't mind. We can work on that. I'm licked. Sorry, sister. That's gotta hurt. Hit it, Jeter. Here is to us. Yeah, we turned Andromeda around, man. At least your two girls turned it around. There is no stopping them. Yeah, no, I guess living in a cave will do that to you. Cody. Cody. I know that tone. You want more credits? There's so much to shop for using the Alliance internet is great. We can get anything we want beamed right to us. When can you take us to another planet? And what's wrong with this planet? Well, nothing, but there's just so much more to see. Yeah, can we leave tomorrow. Yes, dear. Whatever you like. Great. Credits. They certainly domesticated you. It was bound to happen sooner or later, Hey, still in the dumps? I just can't stop thinking about her. I want to go back. You know what can happen if you do that. It's just not fair. Hang in there. Hey, buy you a drink. I got one. Come on, buddy. Cheer up. I don't want to. Why don't you ask Zula and Becca for a little company. I'm sure they'd be happy to oblige. Thanks, but no thanks. You want to take a ride with me and the girls tomorrow? Nah. You're not just going to sit here all day? Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you decide to come with, you know where we're at. Buy you a drink? I said no thanks. Roxy. What are you doing here? I guess, I couldn't live without you. What about your laws? Laws are made to be rewritten. Well, how did you get here? Holy crap. We have some unfinished business, Cody. You can't touch me here. No? Fine. I'll go touch somebody else. What? I've decided to re-evaluate our planet's position on men visiting, and I figure the only way to do that is to see how they've evolved. This is as good a place to start as any. So you want to be a hostess? But no matter what happens, I'm still in control. Well. Men, one kiss from an incredible woman and they turned to putty. A constant plane in space circling throughout time. A never ending chase, a search for the supply. Catch a fleeting glance. Split second and it's gone. for one chance. Obsession for. On and on. Oh, I'm going to find it. On and on. Across the milky way. On and on. Like a thousand light years. On and on. Throughout time and space, time and space, time and space, time and space, time and space. Relief is overdue. I think I'm gonna crash. Simulation's ending. A stimulation's past. On and on. Oh, I'm trying to find it. On and on. Across the milky way. On and on. Like a thousand light years. On and on. Throughout time and space, time and space, time and space, time and space, time and space, time and space.
