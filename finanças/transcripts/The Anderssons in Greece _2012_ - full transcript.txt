Stretch... Stretch your arms out nice and long... // Sune in Greece You've got to stretch! That'll do. Whatever. Can we get out now? We'll just wait for Speedy McQueen to come in, then you can go in, OK? What a pity, Sune, that you missed this lesson too. I know. I mean, really, I've had such bad luck this whole spring. You can't swim in plaster. I was going to go for a bike ride but the handlebars were loose. - I fell down the steps. - So I heard. And you've got osteoporosis and you've been in real pain and... - Ow! - Exactly. OK, you can come in now and get your certificates. You've all been great. Really great. Hi. Congratulations, well done. Congratulations, you did really well. - What? - Sune... Only those who have learned to swim get a certificate. I know all the strokes, I promise! It's not really the same thing, is it. I'm only going to Mosquito Mire this summer anyway. - Congratulations, well done. -Thank you. - Well done, congratulations. -Thanks. Easy as pie. Hallelujah! I'm better! Praise the Lord! - Do you want it? Just one previous owner! Hi, girls! Mum, if we're going to Mosquito Mire again can't I go with Martin to his island cottage instead? No, because we have to be the palest in the neighbourhood. - Just like every other every year. - You don't get it! - What do you mean? - I can't live without Martin! But sweetheart, there's plenty more fish in the sea! Hi, Hakan. One, two, three... SUNE + SOPHIE 4 EVER Sune loves Sophie. Oh, family! Now? What are you standing there for? Come on, let's get it over with. Welcome everyone to the Andersson family's family meeting. I have something to tell you all. - You've realised what a jerk you are? - Not that. So what have you ruined now? My God, what do you think of me? Tell us. I'm in the middle of something important. There's nothing more important than this. - Something happened today. - I knew it. I was sitting at my desk... ...and after lunch I realised I was feeling a bit sad - Rudolf. - Hi, Ralf. - Time to take a break, eh? - I wanted to go away on holiday. It's not 5 o'clock yet. Now. - Got any holiday plans? - Oh, yes indeed! And I'm finding all this caravan nonsense a bit too much. We've bought new tyres for the caravan. So it'll be Mosquito Mire, as usual. I was wondering if you fancied doing something else? So maybe we could do something else? You see, there's a big congress for all of Europe's tax experts in Greece. I promised the wife I'd be free... Something completely different.. Perhaps you could go in my stead? I've always been so spontaneous. Game for anything... Well? So I thought since we're spending a whole holiday together... I don't know. I've just bought a new fishing rod. Oh well, I'll have to find someone else. No! No, of course I'll do it! - Greece has fish too, I suppose. - Of course! So maybe you could take a look at these too. A few late tax returns. So your wonderful dad decided... totally spontaneously... ...that we will go to... Greece! Wait! That means you have to be able to swim. Of course! And your swimming classes are over! Can I see your certificate? No, they've stopped giving them out. We were applauded instead. It was better for the environment. But can we afford it? You have to treat yourself sometimes, as I like to say. And...I got a little bonus this year too. A bonus? For my "exceptional contributions to tax auditing". I'm so proud of you! There's a troll you can play with! - Ralf? - Hello, Rudolf! Great that you called! I've just told my family about Greece. They were overjoyed. You don't have to go now. The wife thought it sounded like a great idea. And I know that you were keen to go to Mosquito Mire again... I've got to go. Enjoy the mosquitoes. And do those returns, if you have time. Rudolf, come here! There's so much for the kids to do! Look! Wow, that looks so nice! Family... Family! We can't go... ...without packing our swimming stuff! - Can I take my surfboard? - Of course! Rudolf... Rudolf, we have to buy new swimming costumes. Look! Why? I think that looks great on you! And it was expensive too. Anna, you can't be serious! - What are you doing? - Dumping Martin. - Are you dumping me? - We've drifted apart. And romantic things can happen on holiday... Who are you talking to? Can't l come to Greece too? So do I have to dump Sophie? Hello? - No, are you cutting me... - What are you doing? I'm bursting for a poo, if you really must know. So I need this. 64,000 kronor! For a holiday. Purchase What have I done? What have I done? 64,000 kronor... Why is Daddy crying while having a poo? Because he's so stingy. What have I done? Don't be sad, Daddy, some new poo will come along soon. Out with Sweden... ...and in with Greece! We're going to be flying through the air! That's life, Sophie. People drift apart... Now that it's summer, maybe we can't be together like we were last winter. We'll see each other again soon, won't we? Easy as pie. - Who is it? - Me, Sophie! Hang on, I 'll be ready in a second Come in. - Hi. - Hi. What a surprise. Hakan... - There's something I have to say. - How nice. Sit down. I thought maybe we shouldn't be together this summer. - Are you dumping me? - No! We can just take a break. - A break? - We're going to Turkey, you see. And romantic things can happen there, you know... What do you mean? I wouldn't dream of doing that! I thought you'd think it was a good idea. Right, and you just leave me here all on my own. Sophie! Guess what! We're going to Greece! - Are you? - Are we? Yes, Daddy just told us. Downstairs, Sune. Karl Sune Rudolf Andersson. Sometimes you really are too much! Well let me tell you that in that case you're sometimes too little! Is she angry? Shall I kill her? No, Hakan. Hakan! I told you. It was something important. Hakan! I'll ljust take some pills and I'll be fine! What's up with you, Sune? - Why, he looks really sick! - He looks sick. We'll have to cancel. - Sune's not sick. He's just miserable. - Stop it. I feel fine. - There, see? Cheer up, Sune! Sun, sea and lovely girls! What do you know about girls? Have I not told you I was the local ladies' man when I was young? You should have been there! I know what girls want. And I know how boys can make girls happy! - How? - You've just got to stay cool. Girls don't want to see everything. Do you get me? How do I know if a girl's interested or not? It can be hard to know what girls think. Some girls don't want to show how impressed they are. - So how am I to know then? - Sune, look at me. I'll teach you all I know. - What do you have in your Y-fronts? - I can't tell you that. She doesn't mean your willy. She means the safety pins. -You have safety pins in your Y-fronts? -How else can I keep them up? Hi there, my darling! My darling... Hey, girls. A flying elephant: "Dumbo Jet"! - Funny. - What's his problem? What a jerk. - What happened? - Nothing. Some girls just don't know what's best for them. - Who's that? - Can't you tell? It's "Pop idol” Lisa. She almost made it to the finals three years ago. Does that mean you're almost good? That's great. And now look at me... And the teeth... Lovely! Ignore him. Maybe you could pout a little? So you're getting a bit of sun before this autumn's contest? - One more from the front... - Have a nice trip. Do you remember that comedy film? - When Lasse Aberg... - Who? Lasse Aberg. He wants a glass of juice. So he reaches up and presses the button, and expects juice to come out! - Did he get any? - Of course not! From the ceiling...? That's what's so funny! - That's not funny. - It is funny. If you press that button you get Coca Cola out of the armrest. Little brother makes a joke. Ha ha. It's true, actually. Hakan! I'm going to kill you! No one gets the better of Hakan! You know they've started putting computer games in toilets? What kind of game? Is it a war game? You'll see. But you have to stick your head down the toilet to start it. - No! - Sure. Put your head in and look! - I can't see anything. - Further down. That's it! Now the war game can start: “The World of Poo-craft“! I'll get him for that! Sometimes you just know. When you meet Miss Perfect. The sun, the moon, and the whole world dance and smile. And you know she feels the same. This you know when she says the magic words... Out of the way. Hakan! Karin... Karin? “My name is Karin and I have slappy cheekies“. Come on sleeky chappies, Sune, Hakan... Excuse me! - I have to ask... Isn't that Karin? - Yes...well, in a way... Karin... Karin... There's a friend of yours here. Hi, Karin. It's me, Sabina! From school. Do you remember me? Sabina Egonsson! - Ego Sabina? - Exactly! It's been ages! A lot's happened since then! - It's OK. It's just a normal overdose. - I see. How sad. Hedda, come and say hello. Are you going to Greece too? I am in Greece. My swim instructor? - That's the rental car sorted. - Pontus. He was a guide here once. In charge of safety, actually. Boss. - This is Fille... - Oh! Little Fille! And over there's my daughter Hedda. - Where's Sune? - Sune? Hi! Over here! - Why has Sune got crutches? - This is Sune. He's such a prankster! I've forgotten something. I'll be right back. Hello, Sune. Hello, Pontus. It healed really quickly. - I've got to go now. - You and I will have a little deal. If you don't say I'm a swim instructor, I'll tell no one you can't swim. OK? I know all the strokes, actually. Sounds like a good deal, eh? Exactly. There are you, Sune! Come on, the bus is leaving. Hurry up! I'll take this. Hey! Hey! Stop the coach! Stop, I said! - It's lovely! - Posh. Can't you just relax? We're on holiday! I can't relax before I go on holiday. I go on holiday in order to relax! We'll see who's relaxed when we get home. - It's included. Give him the bag. - Come on, Hakan. Boys, wait, we have to check in first. Come on, Anna. Wow! Cool! Last one in's a big poo! Can you still not swim, Sune? Sure I can, but not wearing clothes, out of principle. I'm in Heaven! - Hello, girls! I've arrived! - Lost your pulling power, Sune? - Maybe they don't speak Swedish. God, what a jerk. - Hi, Mum! - Oh, Hakan... - Hakan, what have you done now? - I weed in the pool! You little scamp! - Came on, boys... Hi! Can I sit here? No, no, let me take that. Tell me if there's anything you need and I'll go and get it for you. I fix. Rudolf, over here! Come and join us! Rudolf, come and sit down. - I'm just... - It's time for an information meeting. Shall we have a drink? - No, no. It's far too... - Expensive? Say that and I'm leaving. - ...early. - Good for you, Rudolf. A heartfelt welcome everyone to the Sunwing Kallithea Resort! Why heartfelt? Because we want you all to follow your heart here on Aphrodite's island. As you know, the food and drinks are free. So take as much as you like. Just show your card and wristband, and whistle the national anthem backwards. What did she say? That last bit was a joke. - What was that? Is everything free? - Yes. - What, everything? - "All inclusive". Is that true? God answers prayers! God answers prayers! What are you doing, Dad? Sune... Everything you see is mine. So do you see that table over there? Can you fetch me two free drinks? - Behave yourself, Rudolf. - Yes, Karin, you're right. Sorry. Get three. - You never know when they'll run out. And for the kids, Julle the Troll will be up to his old tricks. But Dad... What? Hello, children! My name is Julle! That's not a real troll. Hi there again, babe. Great place, eh? Yes. Lovely. What do you say we take a walk on the beach? You and me, the moonlight... - Sure! - Super. See you down by the ice-cream kiosk tomorrow evening. Perfect. -...we could go and visit grandpa. - Listen Dad, I'll call you later. And don't forget to visit all the island's sights! You'll have a wonderful time with us! I've been looking into the things you can do here, and there's quite a lot! They have spinning, body toning, yoga basket-weaving, aquarium care, stretch, relax... - What's up with you? We're on holiday! - Thank you, Karin, you understand me! Kids, I want you to help Daddy, who's spent crazy money on this trip, but... But there's a way we can earn it back. If we do loads of expensive things, we make money just being here! See? - Not really. It doesn't make sense. - No, maybe not. But it doesn't matter. - You two go to the kids' group, now. - Do we have to? Do as I say. No one's getting out of it. We must all do our bit. And eat a lot of ice cream. The big ones. Good boys. So Anna. Kitesurfing or feta cheese making? - What are you going to do? - Make a Greek pot. - But Dad, you don't like pottery! - It's not all about liking! If we're going to earn back the money we have to make sacrifices! What? What was that? - Hi, Karin! - Hi. I was a little shocked yesterday. - I apologise for being so forward. - Do you? It's things like this that really make you stop and think. What are my problems compared to yours? - What? - When I sneeze... ...I sometimes find I...leak a little. Compared to you, a little squirt now and then is nothing. - What do you mean? - The wheelchair, and your... ...your drugs... Drugs? Oh, I see! No, I'd just taken too many pills for my fear of flying! No, I'm fine! That's good. Is it just when you sneeze? Time to gather round! Come on, children, hurry up! Stand here. No sword-fights now. In front of me, in a group. Hurry up! Hello. My name's Linda. Julle the Troll and I will be taking care of you this week. - Can you wave to the children, Julle? - Hi kids, what fun we'll have. Yeah. Hi. Alright? The ice-cream kiosk... the beach... ...you and me. - And? - Kiosk, beach, party-time! So see you later! See, I still have my pulling power! To the pool! No! - Can all of you swim? - Yes! - No... - Then let's do some bombing! Come on, jump in! Jump! Jump in then! Life for a ladies' man is tough. You 're not always in top form. Sometimes, you're somewhere else... Bugger! Sune, sweetie! Sune Pune... Sune! Sune... You were so good I thought you were the cutest and best of all! Thanks. But the loveliest one was you! What do you mean by that? Sophie! We haven't split up. We're taking a break Aren't we? - But I thought.. - A break? So you're not free? - Guards! - Throw him to the lions! - Sorry! Sorry! I didn't mean it! Hedda! Sophie! Help me! Sune? Sune, you were just dreaming. Would you like a kiss? I'd love one! Kiss me! I don't know why I didn't do something about by worthless marriage earlier! Sorry, don't you like mayonnaise? Sorry. My God, were you sick? Before the divorce. I was burned out, had no sex-life... We decided to take a break, so Hedda and I went away on holiday. And there he was, Pontus. We can't control our feelings, can we? And nine months later, Fille arrived. Pontus is such a great dad, he's so wonderful. - How lovely! - And guess what. We might be buying up this whole hotel! That'll make us financially independent and then I can consider marrying him. How about you? Who did you meet after school? Well, it was Rudolf. He's nice. A real hunk. What the hell are you doing? Those doughnuts are mine! Yours? It's all inclusive! But not those doughnuts. I bought them in town. With my own money. Sorry. Sorry. - Rudolf! - Sorry. Shit! I'll get him for this! - Good evening. Time to stock up! - How lovely. Here you are. Thanks. OK, kids! Ready, steady... Eat! Now just eat until you burst! - Sune! Take some greens too. - And not just potatoes, Hakan! Should we take dessert now, or wait? Wait? I think I'll take a few more potatoes... Sorry... Excuse me, I think there has been a misunderstanding. - You said it's all included. - Of course. But you're sitting at the buffet table. The guests all get their food here. Oh, I see... This isn't going to be easy. - Does anyone want my pudding? - Me! I think I'll go and rest my head for a bit. - You do that, baby. Does it hurt? - Yes. - What's the book? - I'm just making a note... Calories, maybe? So it was time for a little romance again. Sophie was right. A break is a great idea. We are proud to present in association with Ving, Sunwing and Thomas Cook and with the support of Candy Hug and "Buzz off" fly spray tonight's star from TV's "Stars of Tomorrow" sponsored by Big Burgers and the Radio Rix charts presented by Red Fly Music International along with Long-Life Milk, the milk with the long taste guarantee Tony's Mopeds and Proderm Sunscreen, here she is: A celebrity product from Celebrity Products: "Pop Idol" Lisa! Another idea I've had is to build a channel looping around the hotel so that you can swim up to the hilltop and take the water chute back down. You'll be able to wave from the top too. But you can't swim uphill, can you? Can you? I've got Rhodes' top engineers onto it. I've put together a team. See, Pontus thinks of everything. You're so good. Wee? Wow! What great effects this “Pop Idol Laura” has! She's called "Pop Idol Lisa". - "Foreigner". - "Foreigner". - And... "Idiot". - "Idiot". Not going well, Sune? You can't charm all the girls all the time. Besides, I've already got a girlfriend. Sophie. I think. - Hi, Sophie! - Hi Sune! How are you? - What have you done to your head? - I just had to rescue some girl... - I was thinking about this break idea. - Me too! - It's the best thing in the world! - What? I didn't think it was good at first, but now it feels great, doesn't it? This is my new friend, Gabbe. And this is Alex, and Sebbe and little Ekrem. - Has he got a speech impediment? - No, it's just a bad signal. Sune, I have to go. We're off to a disco! - Can't I come too? - What? Cool song! - I've got a slow dance with Gabbe now. - Sophie, wait! Don't hang up. Pool, I day. Cleaning, 4. Drinks, 23. Coffee, 8. Total value Feeling happy? Am I feeling happy? Can it get any better than this? We have sun, a pool, food, friends... All completely free. Just like something else I just thought of... I don't know. I'm tired. And there's me thinking everything was all-inclusive here... I see, that's what you mean... - Good, then let's get going. - Come on, sweetheart. Sune...? How are things, Sune? I can't join in with the children's group with this anyway. What shall we do today, then? Here's something that looks like really good fun! Ancient Greece goes back thousands of years and is considered by many to be the cradle of Western civilisation. The ancient Greeks fought off invasion by the Persian empire and then became part of Byzantium. The Olympic Games are one of the legacies of this period. We've all had a lovely time, and it'll soon be time to dismount... The Greeks believe that Aphrodite can still cure all broken hearts. Can she? Where is she? Aphrodite is on the big Greek tour. Time for some souvlaki! There's some here for those who ordered it. And there are other choices too. Is that you, Aphrodite? Is it you, the goddess of love, who's talking to me? Yes... You, who knows about love. What am I to do? My name's Karl Sune Rudolf Andersson and I've completely lost my pulling power. I don't know what to do. Paint me red. - What did you say? - Paint me red, if you can. Paint you red? That's not allowed. - Really? - Isn't there anything else I can do? Nothing works for me. Please. Stay silent...for one day. Will that help? Thank you so much, your divine Goddess Aphrodite. I bow to you! - Why are you so quiet today, Sune? - Is your tongue loose? - A loose tongue means you talk a lot. - But his tongue's loose. Fallen off. Where shall we sit? It's packed! Are we the Andersson family? Yes, we are. Shall we find the best place? Yes, we shall. - Do you trust me? Do you trust me? - No. - I want to swim with the sharks. - Well you can't. It's too dangerous. But I want to live dangerously! We already are, because we're right at the edge of the resort... - Rudolf! Family, here it is. The best place. But there's probably a good reason why no one's here. Maybe your clever little daddy is expert at finding the right place. "Lena", two letters. - PH. Lena PH. - Well done. - Did you have to bring that with you? - It's my summer hobby. You do crosswords, I do tax returns. Anyway, who else would do it. It's holiday time. I'm starving. Can't we get some calamari? There's free moussaka back at the hotel. I mean, it's so delicious. "Madman", five letters. Idiot! Good. Come on play, Sune. The rat also wants to play! Why aren't you speaking? Are you not going to speak for the whole day? Suit yourself. What are you playing at, Sune? He doesn't understand. That's one spaghetti Bolognese with extra cheese cherry tomatoes and a splash of ketchup. Without extra olives. Thank you. What does he want now? - I think he wants to say something. - That's exactly what he's not doing! A giraffe with a sore throat! - Everyone's pooing...in... - Robert Wells! Everything's floating! Two points to the red team. I'll pass the question over to the blue team. What floats? - What floats? - A strong... - A frogman! - ...builder! - Paper! Paper! - A man with a banana! Paper on the arm! Paper on the arm! “All our things are floating in the sea because of the tide"! Is it right? Is it right? Yes! And the winners are...the blue team! Gangway! Oh no! Johansson! Anna! Come and help us! The whole of Bollnas is sinking! Every Johansson with an income over 25,000 a month is floating to Turkey! Bollnas? That's where we live! Don't be sad, Daddy. Some new tax fiddle will come along soon. - You seem funny. - Yes, it worked! - What did? - You won't believe me. I was helped by a special person with a problem I had. Who? Aphrodite! - Aphrodite? - Yes! The goddess of love! She cured me! Can't you feel my pulling power? Wait. How about now? Don't you feel anything? Nah...perhaps a few odd crumbs. Listen, I can help you. I'm a girl and I know what girls like. OK, but I must warn you. Don't fall in love with me. Hedda! You know what Mum said about your sun hat! That's better. - So what should I do. - Idiot. I know. Come on! - So what do girls like? - Pranks! I don't see why people say it's boring not to bring the whole family here. But if you want to do something with the whole family, what can you do? Pontus, if you want to do something with the family here, what can you do? A boat trip. -Is it included in the... - No, it's not. I don't know. Karin gets so sea sick. It happened once, at the end of the 80s in your dad's little rowing boat. Pontus, can you help me? My cap's in the pool and I can't reach it. What? Sure. Sune, you've not forgotten our deal, right? Keep mum, OK? Good. - Sune! - Sorry, it was an accident! It's OK. thank you, Sune. Good initiative. Might as well have a swim now. But why was that good for my pulling power? Girls like naughty boys who do dangerous things. - You can see that, can't you? - So I'm a "naughty boy", am I? Yet it was strange. He didn't get angry. He enjoyed it. We'll have to play some more pranks... It's OK. I'm fine. Good try, Sune. Really. - That's not funny. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - Move that... - Let Sune decide! I'm fine. Good move. What's up with our sweet little Sune? What's got into him? - What are you doing? - What? - You can't go into Sune's computer. - Maybe not. But we must find some clues, right? Oh, my God! What is this? - Look! - What? What the hell kind of creature is that? - Can't you tell? It's me! - Oh, right. I see it now. - It's a bad angle. - I'm deleting. - What do you think it can be? - Puberty. No! He hasn't got a male role model! That's it! - We should do something together. - Show him we're a normal family. - I don't think he feels secure. - We are a normal family. Yes, of course. And we must show him that so that he feels calm and secure. It'll be fine. I'll be manly. I'll get him for that. Sune, hi! Great! Look, I think we have to talk. Sune. Sune! Stop! Stop! Hey. Sune! I said stop! Sune, come on out. OK? I'm not going to hurt you! I just want to get you an ice-cream. And sweets. We had a deal. Do you know what that means? Yes...sort of. - You have to quit the pranks. Hear me? - I hear better than I've ever heard. - Good. - Ow! Exactly. Why must we wind up Pontus all the time? - Because it's fun. - I don't want to do it any more. Why? Now when we've come so far... You're getting your pulling power back... How about you? Is it so hard for you to fall in love? I told you, I hate love... You couldn't be in love with him, could you? Not in love. Interested, perhaps. His head's just full of squid. If you like, I can teach you what boys like to do. - OK, so what do boys like? - Romance. - Cheers. - Cheers. I'm full as a fart, as Sophie says. - Who's Sophie? - An old girlfriend. - We're taking a break. - A break? What's that? I think it's when you're not together any more. When you're free to have a holiday flirt. That's why my mum said last year. Holiday flirt. - What? - It was before she met Pontus... ...and knew that she was pregnant. But you seem to me like a really nice family. Are you kidding me? Mum just cares about herself and Pontus and Fille. She doesn't care about me. - You haven't seen my family. - Yes I have. They're wonderful. Are you blind? My family's the craziest family there is. - Are they? - My dad's a nutcase. Mum's bonkers and Anna is stupid and Hakan...is like some sort of alien! I'll show you. No, Hedda. Let me. He's coming. Everyone get ready! Don't forget to be normal now! I've warned you. We're a totally abnormal family. Hello, children. Welcome. What? How lovely that you have a friend with you! A glass of juice? And maybe a bun? - Thanks. - Help yourselves. Father - Mother - can't I babysit my darling little brothers tonight? Yes! Of course you can! Of course! Why aren't you being normal? - But we are being normal! - Completely normal. They're not normally like this. I promise. Honestly! Show her what a dork you are. Father never does anything dorky. Sune, you're talking nonsense, but I love you anyway! And Mum, why is it so tidy here? You hate tidiness! What do you mean, darling? We've all been tidying up together. - We love it when things look nice. You lied to me! Your family is wonderful! How could you? No, wait! What are you playing at? Why are you doing this? - Darling, buy me a drink, will you? - One drink coming up! Where's the "all inclusive"? Where's the card? Have you seen it? And yet again, we've saved Julle from the pirates and he's so happy! Yippee. That's it for today, and don't forget our pirate finale tomorrow. Don't take the swords home if you've not paid for them. Give them to Julle. You forgot this, Hakan. I'll get you for that. Bloody kids! Hi Hedda! I've thought of some things that we can do that boys like. - A kissing class and a snogging class. - We're not doing anything. But... - Sorry about yesterday. - I don't care. I'm not an expert. I don't know what girls like or what boys should do. I only said that because I'm so pissed off with my mum, Pontus, everything! I can help you. You lie. No one helps me. Ever. This can't go on. When will I meet the hotel manager? It's embarrassing. Don't worry. I'll sort it, I promise. Can you take Fille today? I have to get some sun. I'm totally white. - But I... - What? - I have to go to that meeting with... - With? - With the water chute engineers. - You did that yesterday. - But they wanted to meet again... - Stop it. just go. Some crisps would be perfect now. - Pontus is a pig. - Julle? No, Pontus. Come with me, I want to show you something. I'm running a bit late, so if you can just... ...you can start the Julle song and I'll be along in a jiffy. - Hakan, know what you are? - Yes. Seven, No. A genius. Imagine. I'll be living here one day. Oh, the sacrifices one makes. There! - Now you can do me. - I can't. I'm allergic. - How can that be? I've just done you. - The doctors wonder about that too. Oh, look! Here comes Julle the Troll! - You must tell me where to walk! - Straight ahead! - What's going on up there? - Relax, it's under control. - Left. No, the other left! - What other left? There's only one! Right, then. - Out of the way! - Sit still, Hakan! - He's drunk! - Out of the way! - What was that? Hakan, keep your balance! Careful...! - I can see them! - What can you see? What can you see? Hakan, what can you see? - Hakan, what can you see? - The crisps! Hey, Rudolf! Rudolf! What are you doing at the moment? I've been to yoga and had a water massage, now I'll go riding and then... I was wondering if you and I could do a little deal. - Deal? - Now? Look! Here he comes! What the hell have you been playing at? Going on the rampage by the pool... - I didn't! - Don't lie to me! I don't know what you're talking about. I'm innocent! What are you doing? The hotel manager I mentioned... I thought I'd introduce you... If Pontus is there, where's Fille? Fille? Life isn't just potatoes. It's crisps too. - Fille! - Fille! - What are they doing? - Fille! Fille! - What are you yelling about? - Oh, God! My baby! My little Teofil! - Where have you been? - Doing pottery. And we've had such a lovely time, haven't we? I can explain. It wasn't me. Someone must have taken the costume. I don't care about Julle. How can you forget our baby? Leave the only precious thing in my life to that prize clown, Rudolf. He is who he is, but at least I'm not married to a troll! Do you want to know how we did it? I sat on Sune's shoulders. And I had to say left and right, because Sune doesn't know all that. It must get quite hot in that costume. - Aren't children wonderful! - We might as well fess up then! I'm Sune's swim instructor, and he bunked off all his classes. He had his leg in plaster. So he and I made a little deal. Who said that everyone has to be able to swim? Sometimes you have to decide things for yourself. Right, Dad? Swim instructor? It was just an extra... - Excuse me, I must go and pack away my costume. - Did you have a deal with Pontus? - No, well, yes, but... It was just a tiny... Pontus! Julle the Troll! What's this? That is a surprise... There's just a lot of numbers, and... ...everything we've eaten and done and... I...well, it's like this. I've made a note of everything we've eaten, drunk and done. All the body toning, yoga, tanning, riding, everything. We've almost reached SKr 64,000! - I just need to eat squid tonight. - But you don't even like squid! No, but then we'll have reached SKr 64,000. Good, eh? Why? - It's good to know such things. - Why is that good? Because it's good to know. - Great. - Isn't it? - Where are you going? Dinner's later. - I know. I just think I need a break. A break? What kind of break? I don't think your mother wants to marry me any more. So you won't have to put up with me. Pontus, I can't find any clean clothes. Can you come here? Either we decide to do this or we forget it. I'm sorry. I can explain. It was just that I... You decide. We'll do what you want. I'll do what you do. OK? OK. Then I decide that we do it. - Though right now I'm really cross. - Thanks! I promise, it'll be terrific! Of course it will, as long as it's not too windy. - Windy? - We've just decided on that boat trip. - Haven't we? - Of course. That's what I mean. Maybe that boat trip isn't such a daft idea. It could be a memory for life...couldn't it? So where is this boat? Funny how you can think that things are somewhere else when they're not. Karin, it's not that boat, it's another boat! The cheaper one, right? I don't know about that... maybe a bit... Shit! - OK, OK, OK... Stop it. Lovely, isn't it. This is where they filmed "The Guns of Navarone". Anthony Quinn and Gregory Peck. Quinn was so taken he bought the whole bay. I'd love to buy a bay. For you. Interesting. - Can you stop being cross? - Stop being cross? Having kids is a responsibility. Responsibility? Weren't you the one who said we two would go away last year, without men? - What? - You totally ignored me! Is that what you call being a good parent? - But sweetheart... - Leave me alone! Touch me and you've had it! She needs my help! What are you doing, Sune? You can't swim, Sune! Sune! Dad's coming! My brother. It was me too. I hoped we'd do stuff, but you just wanted to play with Sune. Come off it, Sune? He's an idiot. He can't even swim. Yes I can. Sune! Sune! Sune! - Sune... - Let's go home and forget all this. Look at me. What do you say? And Pontus? He's not really the man I thought he was. He's not even honest. Let's leave all this and go home. Pontus isn't the problem. Make your mind up! - I want to go swimming too! - Hakan! - Rudolf, go and get Hakan! - What? Hakan! What were you playing at, Sune? - I did it, Mum! - Yes, you did! Rudolf? I spoke to the doctor. He seems OK. Sune, too. - We have to talk. - What? - We have to talk. About us. - About us? How do you think we're getting on? - Well...I don't know what to... - We can't pretend that it's all OK. No, sure... - So how bad do you think it is? - I think it's... - Sort of OK bad. - Sort of OK bad? You're obsessed with money! Is that more important than how we are? Are you sick? - You refuse to understand. - Well... It would be nice if you just... listened...for a change. Can't we just enjoy these last few days here, darling? And let's not keep thinking about what everything costs. Can't we? - Why aren't you saying anything? - You told me to listen. Sophie... Sophie... - Sune? - He's delirious. I've seen the light. Oh, Sune Pune... You should always leave things as you find them. I have something to confess. I'm not sure, but... ...I think I'm in love with you. What? I know. Is it stupid? I don't really know. I've done something brave too. I thought it was about time. - What? - You'll find out later. - Paint me red. - She did it. Thanks for your help, Aphrodite. Aphrodite? My name's Rudolf and I'm married to Karin. My wife Karin thinks I'm too stingy. That I think about money too much. Which isn't surprising, because I paid a lot of money for this holiday... - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. - Have you and Mum had a row? - Yes. So I thought I'd come and have a chat with... It's said to work wonders for love! - What brings you here? - Love. Love is like the sky. And the clouds are just small problems that blow past. But the sky's still there. For ever. Say that again, Sune. - What? - That about the clouds, sky and love. Love is like the sky. And the clouds are just little tiny problems that blow past. - But the sky's always there. For ever. - For ever. Thank you, Sune. Thank you! Thank you, Sune! I didn't even come up with that! It was "Pop Idol Lisa"! See you at the party! There. Perfect. A little tzatziki, some calamari... Perfect. - Anna, this is very kind of... - Yannis. Yanny, thanks for letting us be here! Good boys. Put twelve more in that tree there and four over there. We can go to the next lantern. If we can find one... - Welcome, darling. - What have you done, Rudolf? I just want to say one thing. Love is like the sky. And our problems are tiny little clouds floating past. But the sky is there for ever. What do you mean? Just like my love for you. I'm sorry, darling. I'll stop thinking so much about money. But I have to say sorry to you too. - Why? - You paid for this by yourself! - How do you know that? - I met your boss in the village. - Hi, Rudolf! - Ralf! I never thought you'd give up Mosquito Mire, you madman! This is our daughter, Lisa. - My dear, what's happened? - She's had a bit of bad luck here. - To say the least. - She's not herself. Leave it to me. Darling... How could you afford this? - I sold the caravan. - Your most precious possession! With its new tyres and everything! Darling! ...so I was wondering if you wanted to get married. To me. - It's lovely. - So you say yes? Hi. - Having fun? - Yes. I was thinking about what you said. About us. We're leaving tomorrow. So are we. But... Don't worry. I think I've got to go now. Good bye, Sune. I'll never forget you. Thanks for everything. I have something I've been meaning to give you. I also have something... - Thank you. - Thanks. - Come on. - Do you still think I'm too much? No. I think you're perfect. Subtitles: Neil Betteridge Svensk Medietext - I'm swimming! - Well done! - See? You can do it? - I can swim! Sune? Hey, Sune? Don't ever do that again!
