Hey, everybody, don't you just love my home away from home? All decorated so beautifully for the holidays. You know, millions of you joined us last Christmas for "Coat Of Many Colors," and I love you for that and tonight we're gonna see another true story of a Christmas miracle that happened during my childhood. Now, I call this one, "Circle Of Love." That special circle has guided me my whole life including one unforgettable painted angel who touched my life in ways that I could never have imagined. Angels and miracles come in many forms as you're gonna see in "Circle Of Love." ♪ Circle of love ♪ ♪ Halo of light ♪ ♪ When Jesus was born ♪ ♪ On that Christmas night ♪ It had been a hard summer and fall at our mountain home but even after facin' both drought and loss something beautiful had happened. Oh, come on, mere minutes to town. Mama's prayers were finally answered on the day that my daddy first stepped foot in my grandpa's church. Lee Parton was a changed man. And now with Christmas comin', we were all full of hope. - 'Okay.' - 'Remember your books.' 'Hi, Lord. It's Dolly. I'm back.' So, Lord, I'm thinkin' how them shiny, red patent-leather shoes would look on my dainty little feet. I like that dress. - Where's Dolly? - Oh. Dolly Rebecca Parton.. Gotta go, but just one more thing, Lord. Can I please play the Virgin Mary in the Birth of Baby Jesus Annual Christmas Pageant this year? I know I ask every year. But if I could just play Mary once I'll never ask for anything else again. 'Dolly!' Except for maybe a white Christmas. Thank you and Amen. - Ow! - Sorry. Wait for me, I'm comin'! Hey! Don't.. Wait, I'm comin'! Wait for me! - Up you go. - Ugh! - Uh, uh.. - Oh.. I almost had to walk! Come in, come in. Rudy, shut the door before you let the heat out. - Yes, Miss Moody. - Oh, I love the wish book. Everything you could ever dream of is in here. 'I want these shiny, red patent-leather shoes.' Wouldn't they look just too dandy with my coat? You best be decidin' 'cause one store bought present's all you're gettin'. - I want a green farm truck. - I want a Swiss Army knife. I want a Betsy Wetsy. She wets herself. I have one of those. I told Miss Moody we can use it for the Baby Jesus this year. We can't have a Baby Jesus that wets the manger, Bessie Jean. 'What kind of mother are you?' With all the practice you've had playin' Mary every blessed year you'd think you knew better. Come on, y'all. You think it's fair that Bessie Jean gets to play Mary every year? She's perfect. Why? Do you wanna? Of course, I do. She's the star of the show. It's my destiny. Why wouldn't I? For one thing Mary is kind of...holy. I can be holy. Girls, to your seats. I know we are all excited about Christmas and the pageant but we have got to finish this semester's work first. Let's bow our heads and pray. Who would like to lead us today? Alright, Dolly. Oh, Lord, thank you for the Baby Jesus. - But also for his mama, Mary. - Mmm. My mama says Mary was just a plain old girl with a heart for you. I wanna believe there's a little Mary in all of us. Some, maybe more than others. But I have hope. 'Cause instead of a perfect girl you picked a plain one with a big heart to change the world forever. Amen. Why, Dolly, what a lovely prayer. Why don't you just hold up a sign that says "Give me the part of Mary, Miss Moody, not Bessie Jean?" You know your problem, Rudy Sanders? - You got no holiness in you. - Neither do you, missy. 'Alright, class, open your books to chapter two.' Is your husband ever gonna speak to me again, Avie Lee? It's been months since I spoke out of turn. Oh, Corla, don't worry yourself. You know how slow men can be to turn the other cheek. Especially Mr. Lee Parton. And him a new Christian too. Okay, I'm gonna take 'em out for ya... Oh, no, you don't have to take 'em out. No harm in lookin'. - 'Miss Bass?' - I'll be right back. 'Miss Bass?' Hello, Miss Ann, how can I help you? 'David's Swiss Army knife is $3.95.' 'Bobby's farm truck, $3.98.' Willadeene's poetry book is $2.25. Denver's Duncan Super Tournament Yo-Yo with trick book is $1.99. Cassie's royal tea set, $3.98, Dolly's red shoes $3.49 'and Stella's Betsy Wetsy is $4.95.' You know, with wet nappies comin' out of her ears why does she want a doll that pees? You don't get to pick the present. You just get to have it here by Christmas and that comes to exactly $24.59 and I think we just might make it. Yeah, if nothin' goes wrong. You know, it's silly gettin' Dolly these red shoes. She's just gonna outgrow 'em. I'll put my egg money in the kitty. Dolly gets her shiny red shoes. - What does mama get? - Nothin'. I got everythin' I want, my children and you. A weddin' ring? After eight kids I'm just about as married as I can get. I don't think a ring is gonna make it any more official. Besides, like you say.. ...it's just a piece of metal. I said that? Hm. Oh, I was just after your egg money. I knew you had some good layers. Look at them. Mary and Joseph. Nobody's that happy. Why should I be smelly old sheep but Bessie Jean gets to play Mary every year? Maybe because she's sweet as honey. Tsk. Honey? Well, there must have been dookie in that beehive. She's a devil, alright. Good thing you prayed that humdinger yesterday. There's nothin' wrong with prayin' for what you want. Don't you wanna be a star? No. I like being the donkey. Where no one can even see ya? That don't make a lick of sense. Class, I've got an announcement. After much deliberation and soul-searching I have chosen the cast. 'The Parton boys are going to play The Wise Men' 'and, Stella, you are going to be The Star of Bethlehem.' How about that, Dolly? I'm the first in the family to be a star. 'And this year' the role of Mary will be played by.. '...Miss Dolly Parton.' Do it. I double dog dare ya. And the part of Joseph, Mary's beloved husband will be played by Mr. Rudy Sanders. - Eww! - He's a keeper. So are you over Rudy playing Joseph? I'll never get over it. But I have to think past it, to my future. Good things are comin' out of me bein' the star already. But don't ask me, I can't say a word. - I promised Miss Moody. - Like what? Okay, just be surprised tomorrow. You get to play the angel Gabriel in the pageant. You'll be beside me. I just told her, "Miss Moody, Judy is tall "stronger than most of the boys and got a fierce look that could drop a charging bear." Yeah, like that! That's great, Judy. See, I knew you'd be good. How could you do somethin' like that without even askin'? Who'd wanna play a donkey butt when they could be an angel of God? Me. I told you that. Well, that's just plum crazy, Judy. Everybody wants to be a star. You do. You want to be the star. Pardon me for carin' that my best friend was stuck in the back end of a donkey. I just see you better than that, that's all. You know, sometimes you don't see past the nose on your face, Dolly Parton. I told you that I wanted to be the donkey. Front or back. But that's just not good enough for you, is it? Maybe I'm just not good enough for you. You's acting like a donkey's butt now. Hey! Oh, thank God. I thought you were a rat. I was about to brain you with this broom, girl. Are you gettin' into my preserves? - Mnh-mnh. - Oh, scoot over and let me wipe off everything you ain't been eatin'. I'm real happy for you, Dolly, get to play Mary. You've had your heart set on it for so long. God hears your prayers. Well, who prayed for him to give me a bug-eatin' husband? And turn my best friend against me? Now, was it God that talked Miss Moody into givin' Judy a speakin' part she didn't want? Or was that you? You's the one always sayin' love never fails. So when you love someone shouldn't you want the best for them? You should, and I know you meant good, baby but did you ever stop to think about what Judy might want? She wants to be the backside of a donkey her whole life I reckon. Maybe, just maybe what Judy wants is for you to love and accept her for just who she is. I accepted her as my best friend. She turned on me and hurt my feelings. Friends don't do that. Are we dead, mama? They're gone! Oh, God, they're gone! - Avie Lee, what, what? - Oh.. Avie Lee, you're dreamin', wake up! Who's gone? ...tears were frozen on their faces! All our babies are dead! Come here, honey. Honey, let me show you somethin'. Relax. Take a breath, take a breath. Come here. Avie Lee, Avie Lee, it's alright. - It's alright. - No. Easy, take a breath. It's okay. Slow down, slow down. Look. See, Avie Lee. See, they're all sleepin'. They're safe and warm as can be. - You just had a bad dream. - No. My dreams are not like yours. Like anybody's. I know it's horrible, but please, Lee. My dreams mean somethin'. I need you to believe me. - I need you to trust me, I ne... - Fine, Avie Lee. You want me to put up more wood? I will, so you don't have to worry. Food, I-I mean, we have plenty, but I'll find more. Water, I can dig another well. But don't ask me to believe in a crazy nightmare about our kids dying... I am not askin' you to believe in a nightmare. I'm askin' you to believe in me. There is more to this world than you see, Lee Parton. Do not be afraid, Mary. You are highly favored by the Lord. Well, who wouldn't be afraid? Do you have to play it with fire coming out of your eyeballs like you hate me? Well, you're the one who wanted me to play the dang part. Okay, well, Gabriel is scary but also loving. Let's pick it up from the script. 'And speak clearly now. We want the whole church to hear you.' Oh.. You are to have a baby, Mary and he will be the son of God. Well, how will this be, Gabriel, since I am a virgin? That's impossible. Anybody who lives on a farm 'know where babies are born.' And we all live on farms. Well, you're not in the barnyard now, Rudy. Joseph was a carpenter, think about buildin', not birthin'! Miss Moody, you think my wife should be bad-mouthin' me like that? It's Judy's fault! It's hard to be holy when you ain't getting no love from an archangel. Can somebody please tell me where we are in this here play? I've no idea, and I have lines. Me too. I have lines too. Class, class, I'm thinkin' until we really understand the material that we should put it in our own words. Make it more natural. Now, where were we? Well, the fire-eyed angel Gabriel has come and scared me half to death tellin' me in the meanest way that I'm havin' a baby. Which Joseph can't understand except in some barnyard kind of way. Hey, don't act like I'm the fool. We all know where babies come from. Right out the butts in the barns. 'Ain't that right, Miss Moody?' Well, uh.. The Immaculate Conception was how, how.. The Holy Spirit came upon her, you big galoot. You got it? I got that you are being mean-eyed angel who ain't got no business tryin' to be holy. - That's true. - You either. Why would God pick a sawed-off little runt like you to play the mama of Baby Jesus? Speak of her betrothed being the size of two husbands, I reckon. You don't even need to be Mary. The only person happier than mama about daddy being saved was Grandpa Jake. He'd come over most mornings with a thermos full of hot coffee and his beat-up old Bible and he poured both liberally into my daddy. You want me to pray over it? Yeah, then quietly bury it somewhere. Nah. You need a water pump, not a funeral. You know, Lee, I have really enjoyed these mornin' devotionals that we've been havin'. I don't know what's worse. You lovin' me or hatin' me, preacher. Ah. You think there's an answer for everything in life in that book? I do. Well, does it say anything about where a man earns his money? Oh, the Bible says a lot about money. What's on your mind, Lee? Well, a guy told me that Cumberland Mines is hiring. Oh-ho. It's dangerous work, mines. Isn't that a pretty steep risk for a water pump? - Yeah, there's more. - Yeah, I figured. I saw Avie Lee holding a wedding ring at Bass's store. She looked like a little girl dreaming. I've never seen her want something so badly. Well, I seem to recollect you saying that, uh a wedding ring wasn't anything more than a chunk of metal and that you could get a lot more use out of a keg of nails. That's before I got religion, preacher. Oh. Oh, oh. I just don't want her to give up on wanting things because she married me. Well, now, Avie Lee tells her sisters everything and bless their hearts, they tell me. And I hadn't heard a word about her pining for a wedding ring. Hm. She buried it deep, preacher. I just want to see her smile again. You know, not so full of fear from the night terrors. She been havin' visions? She dreamt that all the kids and her were in a circle. Starvin', frozen to death. Said it was a warnin'. And then we got into a tussle on whether it was a vision from God or just a nightmare. Avie Lee's had these visions ever since she was a little girl. - It's a gift. - More like a curse. Can you help her get rid of that? Well, I'll tell you what she wants more than that ring is for you to trust her. Trust that she can figure out the sign with God's help. How am I supposed to trust that that is a sign from God? Well, I believe if I was you that I would reconsider the mine and make up with my wife. It'll be safer. I'm gettin' her that wedding ring, come hell or high water. Don't let the sun go down on your anger. You remind her, that's Biblical. - Oh. You can't be mad at me! - Whoa! Lee, get off me, you big lug. Look at me, woman. You can't be mad at me. Lee, I've been foldin' these clothes for a half hour and you come in, you're covered in grease from head.. ...to toe. Bible says, "Don't let the sun go down on your anger" Avie Lee, and it's gettin' dark. So you can't be mad at me just 'cause I ain't perfect yet. - Did daddy send you in here? - No. Maybe so. You know I never do things unless I want to. So just to show you that I'm a changed man and that I do trust you, I'll do anything you want. Anything? Sure, as long as it's Biblical. Oh. It is very...Biblical. Could we get this show on the road? You know I could die from this? I think this water is beginning to freeze around me. You know, summer is good bap... - Lee is gettin' baptized. - And then hospitalized? Unless the spirit is movin' you it ain't nothin' but a freezing bath.

He ain't a baby. I mean, what kind of man sleeps past 6 a.m. in the morning? One that's on city time. He's a musician. He works most of the nights and sleeps in the day. You call that work? He can't support a family. Ain't got to. He's young, good-looking and talented. He can do whatever he wants to. Which is sleep in my chair, I reckon. You don't think he's in some kind of trouble, do you? Nah. He just feels comfortable really. He's my baby brother. Well, that doesn't mean you gotta treat him like a baby. I mean, Billy's a man now. - Well, look who's jealous now. - What, m-me? Jealous? Feel that, woman. - That's what a man feels like. - Yeah. Okay. Well, why don't you.. ...take that big axe of yours.. Mm-hmm.. ...and go cut me a Christmas tree? Go on. Hm.. Phew! I thought he'd never leave. Oh, me, neither. Dolly Rebecca, why ain't you in school? Because me and Uncle Billy sat up all night playin' and singin' and dreamin'. Which Uncle Billy says is more important than anything. Ain't that right, Uncle Billy? Yes, ma'am. You bet your bottom dollar it is. Your mama used to know that. Back when she had the prettiest voice in the whole county. 'Before she had kids.' - 'Oh, yeah.' - It's not true. You had more talent than the whole family put together. Mama, did you wanna be a star? - Mm-hmm. - No. Now get on to school. Okay. You ought not be fillin' her head full of foolishness, Billy. What, like you did me? And why do you think I am in the music business? 'Cause you believed in me. I'm just returnin' the favor. She's got somethin', and you know it. - Hey. - Hot damn! Shh. You'll give me away! Ain't you supposed to be at school? Mm-hmm, but I had to talk to you before you gone back to Knoxville and forgot about me. I want you to make me a star, Uncle Billy. You do, do you? And why should I do that? 'Cause I write songs, I sing, I dance and I pick that guitar you give me most every day. It's my destiny to be a big star one day. Every day I wake up and it's like "Is it gonna be today?" I got me a big dream, Uncle Billy. And I think you're a part of it. Is that a fact? Well, how about you tell me all about it on the way to school? And when I get back from Knoxville we'll all have us a little talk about your destiny. Eeh! Alright, is my Baby Jesus ready? Can we get some help up over here? She's dry, Dolly, and very clean. Thank you, Bessie Jean. That's real...proper. Wise Men? Where are my Wise Men? We're right here, Miss Moody. Loaded up and ready to go. Thank you. Alright, I need my donkey in position. Gloria, Claude. See, you could've been under there right now. Nobody even know it. A real friend would understand that. A real friend wouldn't be so mean. A real friend wouldn't make me something I don't want to be. Judy? Judy, honey, where you going? You want me to fetch the Goody's Powder, Miss Moody? Hey, if we was huntin', we'd be starvin'. Every deer in the woods can hear that racket. What's in your pocket? - Uncle Billy gave 'em to me. - What for? For being his favorite nephew, I expect. Hm. What about you? You're not popular? I was gonna buy mom a Christmas present with it but you can have it. No, you boys hold on to it. It's probably the only money you'll get in this life you don't have to sweat for. And I got my own plans for mama come Christmas. Hey, Willadeene, Willadeene. I've only got, like, $28, no more. So don't let her snooker you. Just let me do the talking, daddy. We'll be in and out. No fuss. Well, will wonders never cease? Mornin', Mrs. Bass. We're here looking for a present for mama. Well, what can I show you for the woman who has everything? I want one of these rings. Well, she certainly doesn't have that. Here, this is the one she always looks at. Oh. Wow! This engraving. No wonder mama loves this ring. - It is so... - So Avie Lee. Beautiful! - We'll take it. - And pure gold. How much? $69.95, plus tax. 'Shall I ring it up?' - ...comin' tonight. - Oh, me too. I've been waitin'.. I told her to hold it. Why? Look, Willadeene, I want to get your mama that ring for Christmas more than anything. But I don't know how to come up with that money in a year let alone two weeks. I do. But it'll take hard work and sacrifice. Mama's never had anything. So now, it's our turn to do something special for her. She needs to know she's worth some sacrifice too. I know they'll do it. I don't want to ask 'em that. It's the only way, daddy. Trust me. I can never afford to buy your mama a wedding ring. And I want to get her the wedding ring that she's always wanted this Christmas. - It's great, daddy! - She'll love it. - It's so perfect. - You got the money now? No, not even close. You're going to steal it, daddy? No! How do you think of things like that? She don't know. So how are you gonna get the ring, daddy? It's our turn to sacrifice. Oh, no. No, not my shiny red shoes. We ain't gettin' no presents for Christmas, daddy? No store bought? - No toy truck? - No Betsy Wetsy? We gotta choose. 'Us or mama?' Show of hands for gettin' mama the ring. Oh, shoot fire. Come here, Dolly. Why does Dolly get all the lovin' when she's the last little one to raise her hand? 'Cause I know how hard it was for Dolly to give up those shiny red shoes. I've never been more proud of y'all than right now. But givin' up our store bought presents wasn't enough. While mama thought we were rehearsing for the pageant we were plannin' ways to make extra money including selling mama's canned goods. ♪ I used to stand on the corner when I was a child ♪ ♪ And I'd play my guitar and sing as the people went by ♪ ♪ The sidewalks were crowded ♪ ♪ But I'd just sing louder ♪ ♪ 'Cause I didn't mind ♪ ♪ Spending my time just spinning my rhymes ♪ ♪ And singing for nickels and dimes ♪ ♪ Nickels and dimes ♪ ♪ A song at a time for nickels and dimes ♪ ♪ A sidewalk rehearsal ♪ ♪ For dreams that I held in my mind ♪ ♪ So if you remember a child on the corner of time ♪ ♪ You'll know that I wrote this ♪ ♪ To repay your nickels and dimes ♪ ♪ Oh nickels and dimes ♪ ♪ A song at a time for nickels and dimes ♪ ♪ A sidewalk rehearsal ♪ ♪ For dreams that I held in my mind ♪ ♪ The sidewalks were crowded ♪ ♪ But I'd just sing louder 'cause I didn't mind ♪ - Thank you. - You're welcome. ♪ Just spinning my rhymes ♪ ♪ And singing for nickels and dimes ♪♪ Are you a dream?

I wanna look exactly like you when I grow up. Well, maybe you will, sweetheart. Just maybe you will. Look at that. Looks like you're making more money than me. You want me to help you count this? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's do it. Uncle Billy's comin' and mama wants pickled okra. This.. It's picked clean. You know we didn't have enough money for the ring so Stella and Bobby sold it all. The okra was a very popular item. And how are we supposed to say no pickled okra for Uncle Billy? Leave it to me. Dolly Rebecca, you are slow as molasses! What is takin' you so long? 'Don't come down here, mama! We got an Armageddon of rats!' Oh, my God! Rats! Uncle Billy, you didn't forget me. You are why I'm here, darlin'. I'm gonna make you a star. 'And my mama made me pick out the switch' that she used on my legs all the way home and it burned like fire. You look so tired, Lee. He cut more than six cords of wood stack. - Dang, Lee. - Lee. Got chores to do. Billy, you wanna come? I will directly. But I got a dime for every kid who helps. - Eeh! Really? - Yeah. Yeah. Billy, Billy, why don't you hold on to your money? There might be a lot of disappointed girls if you can't take 'em to the picture show. - Go to bed, kids. - 'Goodnight, babies.' - Goodnight, mama. - I love you. - Night, y'all. - Goodnight. - Thank you, Willadeene. - 'Welcome, mama.' Come on. - Now, talk. - 'Stella, get in bed.' - 'Come on, Dolly.' - I'm comin'. You know, ever since I heard Dolly sing.. ...out at Lee's baptism I've been thinking about taking Dolly on the road. I mean, she would be just right for Cas Walker's radio show. I think that would be a great start for her. I got some ideas about her, Avie Lee. Whoof! She's just a little girl and this world is such a big old place. I know, I know. But I'll be there to look after her. Better me than some stranger, sis. 'Cause it is gonna happen, Avie Lee. And you know that, don't you? I want her to be my little girl for one more Christmas. - Promise me. - Sure, sis. Yeah. Will he agree? - No way. Never gonna happen. - Yes, it can. Listen, I, I got connections in Nashville, okay. 'That can be very helpful.' 'People are drawn to her, Lee.' I mean, when she sings when she flashes that little smile of hers, Lee when she talks her little talk, people stop... Hear me, Billy. Dolly ain't goin' to work. Daddy, please, I love to sing. It's all I want to do. I know I could do a good job on that radio show. You don't need a job, Dolly. Well, she's already got a job. What, you just want her workin' for you for free? Is that it? Hey, Billy, it's best you be leavin'. Please don't fight. I'll work all the jobs. I love to work. I hate school. I do, daddy. You know I do. I hope you're proud of yourself. You got a nine-year-old ready to quit school. You want her to be uneducated her whole life? - Dolly, go to bed. - Don't tell my kid what to do. Dolly, go to bed. Now! - Just remember, we're family. - Now! Everybody needs a dream, daddy! This is mine! Don't take it away from me! You know, Billy, you show up and you throw your money around you get these kids all fired up. But you're gonna be gone come tomorrow and all they're gonna have is a couple of shiny nickels and a stinkin' feelin' in their gut that they're never gonna amount to nothin'. Don't you know dissatisfaction can ruin a person, Billy? Yes, I do. And when did you get so comfortable with it, Lee? Dolly was made to perform. That's who she is. She has a gift. Avie Lee had it too. Now, you want the same life for Dolly? You can't keep chopping wood like this, Lee. You're gonna do damage. - I mean it. - I'm done anyway. Truck won't start, and no one left to sell wood to. We're okay. No need to worry. Well, Billy's right. I can't even provide for my family. - He said that? - He didn't say it, Avie Lee - but he thinks it. - He better not say that. What kinda man can't give his family a Christmas? That's not true. They get a present every year. Oh, stop, Avie Lee. One present? You think that's all I want for them? They are happy. That's what matters. - Dolly ain't. - Dolly's different. Any presents would make her happy. Yeah, tell that to the shiny red shoes she wants. Dolly's like a bird. If it's shiny, she wants it. But it ain't gettin' that makes Dolly happy, it's givin'. When she sings, she gives everything she has. Even if nobody's watching. That's what makes Dolly happy. Makin' other people happy, that's her gift. Hm. I see Billy's convinced you too, huh? Look, Avie Lee, sometimes you gotta do things you never thought you would do 'cause you can't see any way around it to get where you wanna go when you're a man. What kind of crazy talk is that? I'm leavin' tonight. - I can't abide this. I won't. - Mind's made up. You promised me when Willadeene was a baby that you would not go to these mines. And now we got seven more in there and you mean to tell me you wanna go to the most dangerous job on Earth? Look, they pay in two weeks what it takes me three months to earn out here. We are doin' just fine. I'm tired of doin' just fine. - Don't you want anything... - I have everything I need. I am tired of seein' them be without. It's killin' me. This is about your pride, Lee Parton, not about us. Well, I'm doin' what I think is best for this family. 'Kids, get up. Your daddy's leavin'.' Are you gonna die? Oh, Stella, no one's dyin'. Are you gonna be home for Christmas, daddy? Of course, I'll be home for Christmas. - Yeah, are you? - I promise. I'll miss you. Where's Dolly? She didn't wanna say goodbye. - Watch after all of them now. - You know I will. Come home safe, daddy. You're my angel now. Hey, uh, now, David. You're the man of the house while I'm gone, right? - Yes, sir. - Alright. You protect them. Yes, sir. Don't get hurt. Not planning to. I love you, daddy. You're gonna be okay, right, daddy? I promise. There you go. Avie Lee, I'll be back real soon. But in my vision.. ...you weren't here. It was just me and these babies dyin' alone. And now you're leaving. Them's just nightmares, Avie Lee, nothin' more. Back before you know it. Christmas was only a week and a half away. Uncle Billy had left and now with daddy leavin' my little heart was breaking. And mama felt it too. Nice day, mate? First day? It shows, huh? I wouldn't play poker if I were you. I seen a lot of men come through this line about to lose their lunch. Been working these mines since I was sixteen. Tried to find other work but always end up back in the hole. Expect they'll bury me here. Well, better get in there. No one pays to talk. Wish they did though. I'd be a rich man! 'Might want to turn that light on.' 'Gets a little dark in here.' Here I am, Miss Moody, ready to clean. - Thank you for hiring me. - You're welcome, Dolly. I can sure use the help. So much to do to get ready for Christmas. Wow! Oh.. Ah.. Ah.. - What's she doin' here? - I was thinkin' the same thing. - Well, I ain't leavin'. - Me neither. Well, then maybe I'll just have to reconsider this job. Ring or no ring for my mama. Well, then maybe I'll just have to let Judy go through my movie magazines and put them in order. Oh, I better do that, Miss Moody. She wouldn't know Marilyn Monroe from Carmen Miranda. Good. Well, girls, I've got some errands to run but I've left some lunch on the table. I believe you two have some things to work out? What kind of contraption's that? Dirt sucker. Sweeps it up and traps the dirt right inside this box. Look at that. Wow! Whoa! Miss Moody must be the richest woman in the world! Do you believe this? 'She got her own private foot washer!' That's not a foot washer. It's an outhouse, only inside of the house. Oh, no! For someone who's smart, you sure do some dumb things. I'm smart enough to know who my best friend is. You was right. I weren't thinking about you. I was thinking about me. But not like you think. Truth is, it wasn't at all about me looking down on you being a donkey. What was it? It was about me not wanting to be alone. Not wanting to stand up there with Rudy without you by my side. I wanted you to shine too. You shine enough for the both of us, Dolly. But why don't you wanna be seen, Judy? Fixed up, you'd be right pretty. And you're smarter than anybody. I just don't understand. I know you don't. You've been padded your whole life. But where I'm from.. ...being invisible.. ...it's a survival skill. I-I, I got to go, Dolly. Take my share of the cleaning money for Miss Avie Lee's ring. But, uh.. Judy. - Hey, daddy. - Hey. I come bearing gifts. You spring cleaning in the winter? No, just getting ready for the big Christmas pageant. No rest for the wicked then. I made your favorite. My special molasses cake. What's wrong? Now, can't I come to my daddy's church without it being a special event? Why are you here? I don't know what's wrong with me, daddy. - You miss your husband. - Somethin' terrible. When he's here, I feel like everything's fine. But without him, I'm just scared all the time. Lee told me that you were having dreams. You still having 'em? - Most nights. - Yeah? But Lee don't know. What is God saying to me, daddy? Why would He give me such terrible visions? Is He testing me? Or preparing you for something. That is what I'm afraid of. There are some things I can't face with or without God, daddy. I can't. Avie Lee, people think that the Bible says that God won't give us anymore than we can bear. That isn't what it says. People face the unbearable every day. But He gives us a way to face anything. You still believe that, baby girl? - Oh, well, I'm trying. - Yeah. ♪ Away in a manger ♪ ♪ No crib for His bed ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus ♪ ♪ Lay down His sweet head ♪ ♪ The stars in the sky ♪ ♪ Looked down where He lay ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus ♪ ♪ Asleep on the.. ♪♪ Hey! Oh.. You know, if I ever had a little girl I'd want her to be just like you. Oh, ma'am. I have never even seen a $20 bill in my whole life. Well, with that voice and that spunk of yours you're gonna be seeing a lot of them in your lifetime. Oh, thank you, thank you. You don't know what this means. Oh, I can still remember when a $20 changed my life. What are you doing out here alone in this cold? Where's your daddy? He's gone off to work at the mines to get mama a wedding ring for Christmas. And I give up my shiny red shoes and all my brothers and sisters gave up their ones to buy a present too. 'Cause mom has had nine of us excepting old Eddie who died. And she never even got so much as a new dress or a pair of shoes since. Well, if you was to put that to music you'd have yourself a country hit. That's what I want to do! But my daddy won't let me. He just wants me to be... What? His little girl? All daddies want that no matter how big you get. That's why this $20 means so much. If I can get that ring for mama Daddy can come home for Christmas. Oh, wouldn't that be nice? You get away from her! Why, this is a child of God. She don't want your dirty money. Yes, I do. That's my money! I earned it! Look, I don't want no trouble, but she's right. She earned it. But you didn't. Coming around decent folks all painted up sticking out everywhere, up to no good! So git and don't come back! Oh, you and that broom make a good team, you old witch. It's prudish old biddies like you that keep me in business. - Now git! - I'm sorry, darlin'. How can you do that? That lady was my friend. That was no lady. And the pretty lady with the fancy car was so nice buass just swept her away like trash. You know, Uncle Billy sees my destiny. Now he's gone back to Knoxville forever. Daddy's gone, and it looks like now mama won't ever get a ring for Christmas. The world just seems so confusing, Miss Moody. Like there's no beauty anymore and no answers in sight. Before I take you home, I have something to show you. Oh, a treasure chest of jewels! You sure is rich, ain't you, Miss Moody? Oh, Lord, no, far from it. When my mother and father died, they left me with a few things. Like this house, a little bit of money and.. ...this. 'It belonged to my great-great-great grandmother' from Scotland. She had Viking blood. It's been worn on the wedding dress of every woman in my family for five generations. You'll be next, Miss Moody. I wear it every Christmas to honor the women in my family. But whenever I feel confused or sad.. ...and I want to feel better I hold it in my hand just like you are now. Because that brooch holds all of the hopes and dreams of the women in my family. And then I feel better. Strong. That's how I want you to feel, Dolly because that is what you are to your family. Their strong little jewel, shining bright. So don't ever give up.. ...even when things get hard. Is that why you chose me for Mary, Miss Moody? I'd like to think so. But in a lot of recent rehearsals I'd say it was more a case of temporary insanity. I used to think you was a big meanie, Miss Moody. Now I know you is more with heart like Mary. Accepting and full of love. And I'm not gonna give up. On daddy, on Judy on the ring for mama. Hm. And I'm never gonna give up on my dream. That's my girl. Get your coat. Go on. 'You do time, Lee?' Got a sick mama? Nah, nah, nah. Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me. - Ten kids and a shack. - Eight and a farm. I knew it. What the hell you doing down here? Saw a girl see a ring. I want to get it for her. - 'Well, I hope she's worth it.' - Yeah, she's worth it. Count it again, please. And this time, add back my $20 you took. I've counted it already. I'm sorry, honey. You just don't have enough. Please understand, Dolly. This is not personal, it's business. I'm sure when your daddy returns he'll make up the difference. Does that cover it, Mrs. Bass? More than cover it. But you can't do that, Miss Moody. You have to wear it at your wedding. Oh, Dolly, I'm 26 years old. Already an old maid. I'll never marry. Besides, Mrs. Bass has always admired it so. But the women in your family. The Vikings, your comfort when you're sad. What will you do without your beautiful brooch? I'll have you, darling. You and the other children are like my sons and daughters. What else would this be for but to share with my family? So what's it worth, Mrs. Bass? Well, uh.. It's priceless, that's what. So let's just start where you've done gone wrong, Mrs. Bass. First off, that was my $20. I earned it singing, fair and square. Now, you say you'd make that right by subtracting it from the total. So don't be adding it back in now that you got Miss Moody's priceless jewel. Besides that, it still don't fix the snatching-it-from-me part. Second off, you've been charging too much for that ring from the get go. And third off. Miss Moody's brooch is a pure gift from her heart. Her sacrifice, it's valuable. So here's what I'm about to offer. You give me mama's ring and a second ring for daddy.. - Second ring? - 'Oh, yes.' By my figuring this money, the $20 you stole the priceless jewel of Miss Moody the pain and suffering all the extra business I brung in here from my singing plus this here sack of money from my brothers and sisters why, that's good for two rings and then some. Now I'm guessing you wanna be on the right side of things. So there's one last thing I need to know. Do you have a pair of shiny red shoes? Red shiny shoes? No. No, I don't. Hm. That is mighty disappointing. Well, I'll take mama's ring and this big one for daddy and we'll just settle up on the rest another time then. The rest? Wait! I owe you money? Mrs. Bass, Miss Moody has taught me the true meaning of Christmas her brooch being a pure gift from her heart. So in honor of the Lord this season and Miss Moody I won't be charging any interest. Oh, and, Mrs. Bass, please understand. It's not personal, it's just business. Huh.. Let me get you Goody's Powder. It helps. ot two? - Is the other one... - For daddy. Didn't I tell you this is going to be the best Christmas? You know what this means, don't you? That you're going to jail, most likely. Oh, grandpa, we did it. We got mama her ring and daddy one too with help from Miss Moody. Miss Moody, thank you. Thank you for all you do for my daughter's family. Pastor Jake, I don't believe I'd ever be able to teach what I have learned from your grandchildren's sacrifice. They are the purest embodiment of the Christmas spirit. Well, we all say that it's more blessed to give than receive but...y'all are living it. And your daddy is gonna be so proud. And look at this! Your mama is gonna be so, so happy. Grandpa, mama won't be happy.. ...unless daddy's home for Christmas to put this ring on her finger. 'Pastor Jake, do you think you'll still have time' 'to stay for the rehearsal today?' No, I reckon not. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass up seeing it today, Miss Moody, 'cause today I I'm gonna have to go get Lee Parton and bring him home to his family for Christmas, isn't that right? Uh, Miss Moody, you just carry on. Yes, sir. I believe this is gonna be a most blessed Christmas. - Yes, sir. - Eeh! Alright, let's see about these costumes. Come on, Denver. Here. An early Christmas present. Something you always wanted. But I don't have nothing for you. They're.. They're.. Shiny red shoes. Do you like 'em? Oh, sure. Sure, I do. 'They were my grandma's.' I got the red paint from a man painting stop signs on Locust Ridge Road. 'Grandma might have had the biggest feet in the county.' In the country. Don't you think these will make you stand out as Mary? Yeah. If Mary was a circus clown. I thought standing out was important to you. That's all. I get it. I do. I finagled you into playing chief angel instead of donkey heinie, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. That you don't love these red shoes. I'm sorry your grandma had the biggest feet in the world. I think she was too. You want me to read that for you? I've been down here so long, I got eyes like an owl. Yeah, thanks. From your wife? Mm-hmm. "My husband. "I know that whoever is reading this letter "is probably a stranger. "I pray my husband is safe. "I can tell you that my husband has befriended you "and trusted you enough to read this letter because you must be someone very special." So I wanna say, Lee you are the finest man I've ever known. Fine on the outside, which Lord knows you know but also on the inside which sometimes I know you don't. But I do. I know you can be stubborn and proud. I know it takes a lot for you to bend, Lee Parton but when you recognize the truth you always bend toward it. I know that's what makes you beautiful. I know I love you and you know I always will. I know that you would die for me but I want you to live for me. Come home to me, husband. "Come home. Your wife." Phew. You wanna write her back? Oh, she knows what's in my heart. Hey, mama. It's snowin'. Maybe we'll have a white Christmas after all. David, why don't you go on outside and board up the windows to keep the heat in, okay? The rest of y'all, come on, it's time for bed. Christmas was only four days away and we were so excited to finally get some snow. But we had no idea how this storm would affect all our lives. Y'all wake up. Babies, y'all wake up. Hey, wake up. Listen to me. Listen.. While we were sleeping a snowstorm like we have never seen has come through and covered the house. So I need y'all to get up and help me, okay? Yeah, come on. It's frozen shut, won't budge. We can't get to the well or to the wood pile. Mama, wh-what are we gonna do for heat? Dolly, go get all the blankets and every stitch of clothes we have and bring them in the living room. - All of them? - Even your daddy's. Boys, help her. Willadeene, go get the baby. We're gonna close off this room and keep the heat in. We might be cold, but we ain't gonna starve. We got enough food for months. Dolly, go down to the cellar and get me a jar of okra, baby. You have to tell her. Dolly, are you listening to me? Get your little rear downstairs. It's all gone. What? - They sold it all. - Why would you do that? - We didn't know, mama. - We're sorry. They didn't mean to, mama. They just wanted to get you a present. Why? Why all this? What glory do You get from us dying out here alone? I have nothing, except You. And You say You're all I need. Well, I need You now. I need You now. - Hey, you got a pencil? - Mm-hmm. I was thinking to write my wife a letter. Oh, this is a good place for it. A lot of truth gets spoken here. Man don't lie in the dark, not down here. Just put it on the back side of hers. Dear Avie Lee, I'm going crazy missing you. I'm trying to be the man that you deserve. The one I see in your eyes. The one that you gave your heart to. Uh, what kind of vermin eats pine needles? We will, if we get hungry enough and be thankful for 'em. Mama? Randy's sick. 'He's on fire.' Don't worry, mama. Daddy'll be coming home today. He'll save us. Daddy's not coming home, Dolly. He is. It's your surprise Christmas present from Grandpa Jake. But daddy didn't come home that day. Grandpa Jake held vigil while the other miners pulled the survivors from the aftermath of the explosion. Need some help over here. His heart sank every time he realized my daddy was not among them. You Lee's daddy? Yeah, he's my boy. I've been waiting for him. Name's Floyd. Uh, can you give this to his wife? His, uh, his last words before the explosion.. ...is to her. Thank you. Baby Randy was so sick and mama was starting to show the strain. David, get me some water. Mum, we, we ran out of water. Okay, you and Denver go in my bedroom and see if you can break through a window and get us some snow. 'Yes, mama.' As the fallen snow continued to bury our cabin the boys tried unsuccessfully to gather snow from our boarded windows. With no help inside, daddy did what he could to free himself from the mine's grasp. But he desperately needed help. 'Lee.' Lee! I'm alright, I'm alright. Pre-preacher? Preacher. We thought you were lost. Of course, I knew better. I figured I was a dead man, preacher. Then a guy come in and pull me out, man named Floyd. - Where'd he go? - Weren't me. I blew clear, walked out alone. I was feelin' terrible I left you but I had to get out of there. Sorry, brother. It's alright. Somebody grabbed a hold of me in there, preacher and they pulled on me. Somebody grabbed.. God has had his hands on you all along. What are you even doing here, preacher? Oh, yeah. Dolly said I had to give this to you, personally. - Dolly sent you to get me? - Yes, sir, she did. She said that nobody to give that to her mama on Christmas except you. I agreed with her. I do like Dolly. No, no, no. Lee, there's more. It's been on the radio. The worst blizzard we've ever seen is just burying Sevier County. Just like Avie Lee's vision. Yes, it is. I gotta get home now, preacher. Alright, let's go. Hey. Oh, hey, Willadeene. Hey. I need you to stay strong for me, okay? There are some things I need to tell you about what's to come. Ain't nobody coming to save us. This is just us, and this is the worst of it. We ain't gonna make it, are we, mama? I don't know. I don't know. Willadeene. I need you to promise me.. ...that if I'm not here when the time comes.. ...will you hold those babies close so they won't be afraid? I will. I will, mama. Thank you. Thank you, baby. But who will hold me? Oh, angel. You're not alone. Mama's here. Daddy and Grandpa Jake drove all night from the coal mines to our Smoky Mountain cabin. They were worried sick about mama's visions and how those visions just might be coming true. Ain't no car getting through there. I'm not too sure about a foot either. Look, I know the woods pretty well. I should be able to pick my way through. I shouldn't have left Avie Lee alone. She's not alone.. ...anymore than you were. Wait a minute. Here, take this with you. Preacher, you know I can't read, right? Lord don't care about that. I don't need the book. I've got him in here now. God bless you, son. We ran out of wood the first day. Then the boys broke up what furniture they could to rekindle the fire, but it just wasn't enough. We were so cold that our tears were freezing on our little faces. Are we dead, mama? But no one in the outside world knew that we were slowly but surely gonna die unless someone came to save us. Mama tried to be brave, but we knew mama well enough to know that we were in real trouble. We are not dead. Mama knew that she was losing her children. Oh, Lord. We are here, I don't know what Your plan is for me and these children. But I choose to believe that You're gonna save us. I choose to believe that, baby. I do. You know what? You know what I wanna do? Y'all wake up. I wanna get y'all close-close. Come in, baby. Oh, come up. Yes, come in, darling. - Is this a game, mama? - No. No. You know what I wanna do?

Well, of course, I spotted that ring winning the only Christmas present we'd receive that year. A big ol' box of chocolate candy. But I shared it with the whole family. She's comin'. Okay, close your eyes. - Okay. - Okay, just step here. Okay, right this way. Oh, what is all this fuss about, Dolly? - Just come on. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. You can open them now. Daddy? Didn't I say this would be the best Christmas ever? Yes. Avie Lee, you're the love of my life. And you are mine, Lee Parton. Mama, do you like it? Ain't it pretty, mommy? I love it. I love it. Thank you. Well, I got a present for you too. Who told mama about the other ring? - Not me. - Not me. - What ring? - I didn't. What ring? That's for daddy.. ...from all of us. I've never had anything so fine. Well, are you ready for your other present then? What other present, mama? Mama made daddy some thumb warmers? Mama, are you having a baby? - Avie Lee? - 'Mama's gonna have a baby!' 'This is amazing!' The shiny red shoe! I'd never seen a painted angel up-close before. Especially not one driving a red Thunderbird. But I never stopped dreaming of looking just like her. And that's one Christmas present I've given myself every single day of my life. Store bought. Now, some might say that before that blizzard hit a good Samaritan left that basket of food on our porch hay for the animals, and firewood to keep us warm. Well, if they did, they never owned up to it. But I believe I saw our guardian angel hovering over the barn that day. Now, some might call that crazy but I truly believed it was a real Christmas miracle. Please hold your families close this Christmas. Love and accept each other and always be kind.
