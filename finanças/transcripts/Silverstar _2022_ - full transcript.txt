So beautiful here, isn't it? Are we going home? Let's go really fast, okay? Go. Let's see how fast you can go. Reigns a bit shorter, look over your horse. Look all the way to the horizon. - Bonjour, Megan. - Hey Carina, hey Josh. - Lovely day, right? - Yes. - I have your new horse. - Bring him to the arena. Josh, he can go to the arena. You have such a nice riding school. - Nice and small. - Thank you, I'm really happy with it. Do you still have time for an amazing horse like Whitestar? No Carina, I'm never selling him. Never ever. Your father asked me already. No, you're never leaving. - He's so sweet. - Come. - Ben, bonjour. - Hey, Carina. Silverstar. - He has a really nice form. - What is it? Come on. Come on. Beautiful. - But he's a bit wild. - Silverstar, don't. - It's never too wild for me. - Silverstar, no. Silverstar. - Are you okay? - Yes. He just gave me... a fright. Be chill. What are you doing, tough guy? Come here. Are you okay? Come on, nice job. - Good boy. - He's pretty wild, right? - Yes, he's a handful. - Nice and temperamental. - Right. - I can work with that. What do you mean, Carina? You'll never sell Whitestar, but I can make you a nice offer for his son. Silverstar is also never leaving. Whitestar and Silverstar belong here. - Are you sure? - Very sure. With professional training I can really make his talent shine. Carina, my horses aren't for sale. Bon, okay. If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me. Au revoir, Ben. Hey Ben, can you hand me the saddle? I don't think he wants to, but you can give it a try. We'll go for a nice ride. - Here you go. - Great. You push me to the ground, but Megan can do anything she wants. Is that how you want to play it? Yes Ben, he's just picky. Just like me. Come on, we'll go for a ride, boy. There, go. Hi. Esmee, where's your mind at? Are you going to help me or not? - What? - Are you going to help me? Yes, Grandma. Turn that TokTik off. You're on your phone all day. Welcome to a new video by Survival Skills. Today we learn to survive in the woods. - Life is here and now. - Yes. - The most important thing about... - Turn it off, come on. - Get some bell peppers for me. - Today, I'll show you... Where did you get a sharp knife like that? - I know what I'm doing. - You sound just like your mother. Then I would've been in South America as well. You know that was impossible with their jobs. I know what will make you really happy. You've slept on it and I can go to horse riding camp? No, I'm going to make that nice pasta sauce you like. I'm so over that sauce. So, Mom and Dad? Can I watch TikTok while I get bell peppers? Head is yes, tails is no. There you go. Make sure to hold the bottle like this, so you get a small focal point. And that way the tree bark will start to catch fire. You don't like it, do you? Here. - Grandma? - Yes? What if I start helping you with chores every day? I could help in the garden and do the dishes. I just think horse riding is too dangerous, okay? If something happens to you, I'll never forgive myself. You won't let me do anything. Esmee. What if this summer, the two of us... Don't bother, I'm going to bed. - Hey Megan, the stables are tidy again. - One second, Belle. Go, Eddy. Hey, that's Eddy. Thank you so much. It was great. - Did he really come in second? - Be quiet. I do wanna give a special thanks to someone special. It's my manager Theodor, he's been such a great help... Thanks man! Whish you all the best. We go back to the studion now. Are you sad that he's in America that often? Come on. Help. The stable is on fire. Belle, take over, I'm going to help. Megan don't, it's too late. - Let me go. - It's too late. - I was able to save Browney. - Let me go. - Megan. - Megan, don't. Silverstar! Whitestar! We have to get out. Ben, do something. Help. Megan. Everything will be okay. Silverstar. Silverstar, no. The stable is going up in flames. No, my girlfriend is still inside. I mean, my colleague. Whitestar, I really need your help. Move over to me a bit. Come on, nice job. - There you go. - Please hurry. We're safe. - Luckily it's not broken. - Great. Are all the horses okay? Are they together? The stable completely burned out. It's a miracle you're still alive. Ben, are all the horses okay? - We can't find Silverstar. - What? Okay, I'll go... - You're not serious, are you? - Megan, not now. Calm down. Hey, what are you doing? Stay there, okay? I'm coming, stay there. Don't be scared. "Silverstar." That's a beautiful name. No, don't. Don't eat the chard. You're eating almost the entire vegetable garden. Wait, stay here. And no more eating, okay? I'll be right back. A horse that eats chard. Crazy Silverstar. Give me a deep sigh, please. When can I ride again, doctor? Your ankle needs a few weeks to heal, so no driving a car. - Car? I mean horse riding. - Give me another deep sigh. Well, how long? - Well, a month. - A month? - Yes, at least. - But I need to find Silverstar. - Here you go. - That's nice of you, Ben. And I called the papers. I promise you we'll find Silverstar. - We're on the front page. - Thanks Ben, you're the best. You're welcome. - Did you hear from Eddy? - No. I get it, he came in second yesterday. Did you hear? - And he has a lot of interviews, so... - He's just really busy right now. Well, if you ever need someone, know that I'm here for you. Thanks for the breakfast, Ben. - Try to eat something, okay? - I can't eat right now, Ben. Do you think Silverstar has something to eat? - Go. - Oh no, Grandma. Go. - Grandma, don't. You're scaring him. - Shoo. Yes, that's the idea. Shoo, get away from those strawberries. No, don't. Silverstar. - What did you do? - What did I do? - Look what that scary animal did. - He's Silverstar. - He'll never come back now. - That's the point. - That stupid animal ruined my garden. - You're the one that's stupid. - Don't run off in a huff. - I can do what I want. Finally something good happens and you ruined it. - What are you doing? - Finding him. - I won't be back until I've found him. - Esmee, come back. "Horses are really dangerous." Yes Grandma, life is dangerous. Sorry Grandma, not now. Where are you? Grandma, stop calling. Silverstar. Wait. Easy. Look. Hey, I got you some grass. Too bad you don't have a saddle, I'd like to go for a ride. I still like you, you know. What do you want? Can I really stay put? Okay, I'm ready. No way, I'm riding. I'm riding. Silver, what are you doing? Silverstar, I said one step. What are you doing? Silverstar, what are you doing? Well, you're silly. Maybe we should walk the rest of the way home. There you go, pretty one. Don't be afraid, but we'll see the woman with the broom again, okay? Come on. Silverstar. Hey, dude. Well... Come here. - Sweetie. - Grandma, I'm sorry. What happened? You need to answer when I call. I was so worried. Grandma, I'm not om my phone all day. Life is here and now. Megan will be so happy I found you. - Hey, I found him. - Yes, that's what I mean. It's pretty impressive you got him to come with you, because you can see he doesn't always listen. I went riding and he started galloping. - What, Esmee? - Hold on, you rode him? - Without a saddle? - Only for a little bit. Because then I fell. You know how I feel about this. What if something happened? Come on. I can come along to help and keep him calm and stuff. Yes, if your grandma agrees. - I'll look out for her. - No, sorry. - I don't like that idea. - Grandma. - You're staying home. - I understand. Thanks again for calling. - Will you calm down? - Why can't I go? You've crossed a line. You can't just run off like that. - You're staying home. - Who made you the boss? Your parents asked me to watch you as long as you're with me. I don't even want to be with you. If you're not going to listen, don't come back at all. Calm down, come. - Come. Hey, Esmee. - Calm down. - Did your grandma let you go? - Yes, she changed her mind. Look, he totally calms down when you're with him. Hey, Silver. - How did you find him? - To be fair - Esmee found him. - Really? How can I thank you? Well, I'd like to ride Silverstar every once in a while. Believe me, this girl has something special. I don't think it's a good idea. I rode him already. She's right, these two have a very special connection. Can I? Is it okay if I think about it? Girls, I think it's about to rain. - Just leave Silver there. - I'm going inside. - Megan, should I give you a hand? - No Ben, thanks. I can manage. - I'll help you. - Ben, leave it. Did you hear what she said? She'll think about it. Can I do anything? Well, if you can pull this one tight and hold on. I'm so sorry about the fire. I got in the car as soon as I heard. - Yes, hold it. - Okay. - Are you okay? - I hate this thing. - Sorry, I... - No, it's all right. I get it. - How are you and Megan? - Not that great either. She only talks about that Eddy and I think that I... I don't think that's what you meant. No, I was talking about the fire. Here. I heard you were both very lucky. - Grab that. - Okay. Well, you can call it luck but the stable is gone and the horses really need a place for when the weather turns. Yes, I get it. They can stay with me, until you have a new stable. Yes well, that's really nice of you, but I don't think we can afford it. Who said anything about money? True value isn't about money. Why don't you just take me out to dinner some time? I can feel the first rain drops already. Okay, well... I'm off, I'll confirm our deal via email, okay? Yes, send it to me. I don't want to bother Megan. Oui, oui. Bye. Otto, can you tow the inside arena for me? - Great. - Too slow again, brother. Too slow? You're cheating. Josh, why haven't you cleaned the arena yet? - There's horse muck everywhere. - We'll do that right now. You promised. Dad will get pissed with me again. - Sorry, Kaat. - Dan, can you help me for a minute? - Hey, are you still here? - Ben? Yes, I wanted... What are you doing? The horses are going to Carina until we have a stable again. - But didn't Megan say... - Hold on. - What's going on? - Megan, didn't he tell you? What? Carina offered to take the horses on loan as long as we don't have a stable. On loan? Megan, those horses can't stay out in the rain. - It's better this way. - I get it, but he stays here. Thanks so much for taking the horses. If we can ever do anything in return... I'll find us a nice restaurant. - Have a nice day. - Bye. - You're going to dinner? - Yes. - Do you have a problem with that? - No, I don't care. You can go out with any woman that throws herself at you. Well, okay then. Gentlemen, this way. What sort of figure did you have in mind? I was thinking of half a million. This is the best jumping horse I've seen in years. - Half a million. - Silverstar. - Do you have his passport? - Yes, of course. Son of Whitestar, there's only one at this point. - He can win everything you want. - And thanks to Carina he's for sale. - Chance of a lifetime. - Those are some big words. - Show me what he can do. - Danny. - This is a waste of my time. - Carina, this is a disaster. Hold on. Danny. Well, did I say too much? He seems to have some talent, yes. But the price is too high. Well, he's a real star, you know. I can't change the price, we have more interested parties. But you get first choice, as a friend of my father. Fine, I'll get you your money. - But I'll pick him up tomorrow. - Okay, d'accord. Nice doing business with you. Josh. Hey, sweetie. No one is going to sell you. I'll make sure of that. - Hello? - Ben? - They're selling him. - What? There's a man that wants to buy Silverstar. Who told you? Did Carina tell you that? No, but I heard her say that. I'm sure you heard it wrong. Hold on. We're all very happy you found Silverstar. - But I'm busy right now. - Then I'll call Megan. No, you won't. She needs to rest. - Then I'm taking Silverstar. - Esmee, stop it. You don't have any proof. If you take him, it's theft. Just go home and I'll check on Silverstar tomorrow. - I'm not going home. - Esmee... I'm just too busy for this now. We'll fix it tomorrow. Why are adults so stupid? Yes, where are you? Oh, sweetie. Yes, in Bolivia. Right? Yes. La Paz, yes, high. Yes, I get it. Really high. Okay. Yes, we just had a nice dinner. She's in the shower now. Yes, she'll call you tomorrow, okay? Yes, I'll do that. Give my best to Diederik, okay? Okay, bye. Oh, Egbert. What are you doing here? Give that thing here, okay? You set fire to the stable. - What are you talking about? - I saw it, that's evidence. Chérie, who will believe you? Danny, Josh. Josh, close the gate. Josh, get her. - Josh. - No, we won't make it. Stop. Easy, easy, good. - Hello? - Yes, hello? Megan, it's me. Esmee. - Esmee, why are you calling so early? - I don't have long, I have Silverstar. What do you mean "you have Silverstar"? I'm on the run. I don't know what to do, they're after us. I've been riding all night. I don't know what this is but just come over here, okay? Easy. We can't go to you and I can't go to my grandma. Stay calm. I'll send you an address and meet you there. Thank you. Ben, Esmee took Silverstar from Carina. - Shit. - Did you know about this? Yes, Esmee has this crazy idea. It's a misunderstanding. - How sad for Carina. - Sad for Carina? - What's wrong with you? - You're one to talk. - With your Eddy this and Eddy that. - What does he have to do with this? Sorry. - Where's Esmee? - With Gerrit, I'm going there now. - No, you're not. - I should make sure... Megan, listen. I'll fix this. Good morning, young lady. - To whom do I have the pleasure? - Esmee, sir. - I got your address from... - From Megan. Yes, did she call already? No, but I'd recognize Whitestar's son everywhere. Why did Megan want you to honor me with a visit? Go. Very nice, go. - Hey, Ben. - Gerrit. Well, I haven't had a single visitor for months and suddenly it's like an open house. - Hey, do you want a drink? - Yes, a glass of water would be nice. Sorry, this isn't right. Esmee, what did I say? - I saved Silverstar. - Yes, I heard. There was some crook who set your stable on fire to sell Silverstar. Really, I have proof. Look. That's Megan's stable. Do you believe me now? Carina did that. Oh boy. - That changes things, son. - No, it doesn't. This is not proof, you don't see any faces. - You can't accuse people like that. - It was on her computer. - I'm sure she can explain it. - But what if she's right? - Then Esmee is in danger. - Don't be silly. Carina's not like that. We'll just take Silverstar back. Were you followed? Esmee? Gone with the wind. Well, that's great. You scared her off. You're blaming me? You're the one who wanted to take Silverstar back. Of course Esmee would run. - She's gone. - Obviously. Don't you find it suspicious that your stable just suddenly caught fire? Well, there's something... It's probably nothing, but... I found this, in the remnants of the stable. But that's proof, man. You can use it to get that woman. Why is everyone suddenly against Carina? Sorry. I don't know that Carina, but it sounds like you have a soft spot for her. - No, she's just helping us. Come on. - Sorry. I already thought it was strange, because everyone knows you like Megan. There's nothing going on with Megan. - And she's with Eddy. - Eddy, of course. Sorry, right. What was I thinking? Eddy. Gerrit, we need to make sure Esmee and Silverstar are returned safely. - We? - Yes, we. Dear Ben. I'm sorry, but I'm not that young anymore and I'm not really keen on the idea to go looking for a criminal. We're not doing it alone, we'll get help. Exactly, the police. The strong arm of the law. - Good morning. - Jenny, from St. Josef? - Gerrit. - You haven't changed a bit. - Oh boy. - What a surprise. - You know each other? - Yes, from a long time ago. - I never forgot you. - Sorry, I... I hardly slept last night. Isn't Esmee with you? We actually assumed she would be here. Where the hell are we? Shit. - We need to do something. - And we will. That's what I told Ben. We need to help Esmee. - I'll call the police. - That's what I said. You can't. Until we prove that Carina or someone else did this - Esmee is guilty of theft. - Really? - Right? - Well, I don't know if... - Who are you calling now? - Esmee. - Or can't I do that either? - Of course. She's not picking up. What have I done? Maybe something terrible happened. You were supposed to watch out for her. That's what you said. Yes sorry, you're right, but... Hey, if you know something... All right. Try to look on the bright side. If this hadn't happened we never would've met again. What are you saying? We'll look for her, it'll be fine. Poor Esmee. Poor Esmee. What are you eating? Apples? Where did you get those? Wait, stay still, okay? I can do a little trick. YOkay now, don't move. Hey, what are you doing there? You're with that woman. - Wait, let me explain. - Go on. Go, Silverstar. Go on. You missed a spot. - What was your name again? - Wilma, Miss. Yesterday is not important. Black Pearl will be fourth. Just bet on him, don't ask questions, got it? - Fine. - What? - Do you think I'm crazy or something? - Of course not. - What kind of games are this? - No games. We have to take care of something before we can close the deal. Come on now. Where's that animal? We're taking him with us. No, Dad. Let me do it my way. I'll handle it. - I thought you had it under control. - Never mind, I'm gone. Please. Listen, you have one chance and that's now. It'll be fine, really. I had a few setbacks, that's all. Listen closely. I'll be back in 24 hours. If that horse is not here by then, I'll settle this my way. D'accord? Now you've made him angry. No, I won't. I'm looking for Esmee and Silverstar. I'm not imaging things. There's someone here. Watching the house. I'm telling you, Ben. Yes. There's more going on here. That clasp, that's the proof. If you need to proof that Carina is not okay then go ahead and do it. - I will. - Fine, I'm looking for Esmee. Good. - Are we going to look for Esmee? - Yes. How will we do that? - I have a car. - Well, let's go. No, hold on. Wait. They're watching us, we need to go out the back. Really? Bastards. - Come on. - Yes, wait for me. Come on, there we go. Go, Silver! Not so fast, I just want to talk. I'll give you my phone number, so you can text me. - Come on, Silver. - Don't, you'll never make it. No, we won't make it. - Is this funny to you? - Yes, it kind of is. Karma, you know. Ben? - Carina? - Bonjour, Megan. How are you? Given the circumstances... But why are you here? I'm looking for Esmee. Do you know where she is? I have a surprise for her. - No. - Too bad. Maybe Ben knows, he talked to her. Bonjour, Ben. I need to run, because... I need to go. Feel better, Megan. Ben? What's wrong? Megan, I think it's better I no longer work here. What? Why do you say that? What do you mean? I'm sorry. I just can't replace Eddy. No, wait. I never expected you to replace him, you don't need to. No, maybe that's the problem. Danny, come in. Over. - Go ahead, over. - Come to the stables. - We're taking a different approach. - On my way. - Is this your car? - Yes. - This piece of junk? - Piece of junk? It's on oldie, you can tell, but it adds character. Life experience. And under this hood is a strong, beautiful engine. It can still go for years. - Are you still talking about the car? - More or less. Madam, may I invite you? Now they'll never find us. Well done. Do you know how this works? No? What is it? What are you doing? You want to show me something? Do you want to help? Silver, come take a look. It's really pretty. Well, for a first time. It worked out pretty well, we can be proud of that. You really don't care. Chérie, what happened? I think I just quit my job. Oh, right. Sorry. - I just don't know what to do. - It's a lot to deal with. And with Silverstar missing... And Esmee. I just feel like it's all my fault. You can't think that, Ben. Why don't we look for Esmee together? - I'd like that. - And why don't you come work for me? I could use a strong man with all those extra horses. Yeah, maybe. - Did Ben say Esmee was here? - Esmee, yes. - Well, let's go. - No. We wait here until it gets dark and then we sneak in. - But that'll take hours. - Yes. So we might as well get comfortable, right? - Is that Egbert, from St. Josef? - Yes. With that Zündapp and those checkered coats. - Yes. - Evil Egbert. That's enough right there. - Coffee? - No, thank you. Almond cookie? Yes, why not. Bit of music to go along with it. Let's see. Romantic Pop Songs. Well Silver, here we go. And I don't even like fish. There goes a fat one. Well, it would've been something if I got it on my first try. Or my second. Luckily we still have each other, right? No one will come between us. - I promise. - How's it going? Come here, I'll help you. - Give me that horse and I will back off. - Get your hands off Silverstar. Dude, what are you doing? - We'll leave the cops out of it. - The cops? Yeah, so you can tell them you burnt down the stable. - You think we set that fire? - I know for sure. - I saw it myself. - You were there? - No, but I have a video. - Show me. I don't have my phone with me. It doesn't matter. I'm not in that video, because I didn't do it. What were you trying to do? Catch a fish. - With a stick? - I saw it on TikTok. You shouldn't believe everything you see on TikTok. "You shouldn't believe everything you see on TikTok." Just you wait. Look. - I'm sure they were tired. - You wanted fish, right? I'm just busy with this now. You watch way too many videos. It's smoking. And where there's smoke... - Don't block my light. - What? Just move out of the way. There's fire. You should watch TikTok more often. If we start here, we have the best chance. - Okay, let's go. - Good news. Yes, Ben is helping us find her. He also really wants to find Esmee. What's the news? Josh texted me. He found Esmee at the lake in the woods. - That's great news. - Yes, amazing. - Great, thank you. - Really nice. You stay here. If Esmee does bring Silverstar back we need someone to be here. - Come on. - Yes. - Mademoiselle. - I can do it myself. - What's this? - Camouflage. Camouflage. You and Egbert, who would have thought? - What did you see in that man? - Everything. He was intelligent, well-read. Very thoughtful. Yes, he was to me. It's funny, but you know what he was really good at? - Kissing. He was a really good kisser. - Really? Okay. You said they were gone. I'm not too bad at kissing myself, you know. It's done. What? I didn't even know we... No worries, it's one of those sensor things. Wait, hold on. What exactly is your plan? None of your business. Seriously, you can't stay on the run forever. Have you never made a fire before? Not a big fire, anyway. Do you still think I set the stable on fire? I don't know. Where's your phone? Maybe I can see who they were. - Back at the... - The stable, with that old guy. - How do you know? - What? - Of course you know. - Hey, wait. - Wait a minute, listen. - I knew it. - Listen. - Let me go. Let's go get it. If you're right, we can go to the police. How do I know I can trust you? Maybe because I'm here, in a cold and dark forest. With you. While I could be gaming at home. Sorry. Not great weather for our first date right, chérie? No. Who's that? What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Protecting my merchandise, what do you think? Babe, come on. What do you think? Don't you get it? - You really don't get it? - Don't touch me. - When Megan hears this... - You and Megan... I said, don't touch me. You just... Ben. Leave him, I want my horse. The roof doesn't stop anything. We should sit close together. To stay warm. But what about Silverstar? He's a horse. Stroke him. It's okay. He's so beautiful. - I want to get out of here fast. - We'll be okay. Sorry. I didn't mean it, sorry. You think Esmee is here? - Did you just close the door? - Don't change the subject. What are we doing here? You've locked us in. You took me here to make a move on me. What? No, I don't want to make a move at all. - Well... - We're calling the police right now. I don't think so. - I don't know what you're planning... - Shut up, Grandpa. TWO NEW MESSAGES I FOUND HER AT THE LAKE Grandma? - What are you doing? - Thought I could trust you, prick. - I didn't do anything. - Say you haven't betrayed me. I said... - You were at the lake. - Exactly. Thanks for this lesson. Esmee. Esmee, I didn't know at the time... We're getting closer. What are you doing, brother? They split up. Silverstar went that way. - Where are you going? - To the car. - I want my horse. - Fine. If you think you are faster than a horse. I know exactly where she is. Uptight bitch. "Free to use the horses as if they're my property until stable has been repaired." What? You've got to be kidding me. "My property"? Ben. What happened? It's my fault. Sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't see it. I just didn't see it. It's okay. There are also things that took me way too long to see. This isn't right. I've been calling, she's not picking up. I know, I haven't been able to reach her either. Ever since she showed us that video when we were with Gerrit. - Wait. - What are you doing? Didn't the doctor say... I really love how you took care of me, but this... We'll fix this together. Give me a boost, come on. One, two, go. Come. Good. I swear I put it here. Hey, what are you doing? It's okay, Jenny. It's not okay. We've messed up. Esmee is in danger. And now we're in danger as well. Don't be scared, I'll protect you. Really, I promise. - Oh, Gerrit... - Oh, Jenny. - Darling. - Say it to me, baby. - Grandma? - What? - What are you doing here, with Gerrit? - We were looking for you. - Untie me. - Esmee. Oh, sweetie, I'm so glad to see you. Luckily you didn't listen to me, right? Look, Egbert is still here as well. Jenny, yes... Sorry that I... I never wanted to put you in danger. It was stupid. Grandma, gross. Did you see that boy. That sleazeball? - Who? - I have an idea. - What? - Quickly, get undressed. Grandma, no. Open that door. - Hey, amazing. - Look at that. Give me that horse. Spare keys, Grandpa. Run, guys. I've got him. Don't. Let him go. What's so funny? It's done. This clasp was in the remnants of the stable you burnt down. - You're caught red-handed. - Bullshit. - Who will believe you? - With this clasp? No one. But with the images on Esmee's phone? - Everyone. - Do you mean this phone? Nice one, Josh. Is it true what Esmee says? Did you burn down Megan's stable? Josh, quit that nonsense, come on. Nonsense? Didn't you film this? I recognize your hand. - Your bracelet. - None of your business. It is my business. Oh yeah? Brother. Are you in love with her? Fuck you, Danny. Esmee. Silverstar. Danny, come on. Run. - Yeah, you're done. Get off. - No, don't. Keep going, you can do it. Do it. Okay Silverstar, I'm trusting you right now. You'll never make it. There, we're done. Give me my horse. Merde. Let's postpone that dinner for a while, Carina. I'm sorry I didn't believe you, Esmee. No problem, I don't know if I would have believed me if I would have heard it. - Don't touch me. - It's all thanks to you, Esmee. And thanks to Silverstar. - Yes, this is done. - Nice. - Too bad Eddy couldn't make it. - He did send me a text. - Such a sweetie, right? - Yes, he is. I know what you want. Little rascal. Guys, gather around. Amazing people, I don't know where to start. Because without you this stable wouldn't be here anymore. I'm really thankful Whitestar and Silverstar are still mine. And for meeting you, Esmee. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all. Dear Megan, we also have a present for you. To put up in your new stable. I hope it's one of your beautiful statues. Good one. Good joke. Esmee, I've discussed something with your grandma. I asked her if you... Want to be the official trainer... - Of Silverstar. - Yes. - Didn't expect that. - Can I really? You're the best, I don't know what to say. Sorry grandma, you're not the best because that is this sweetheart, of course. It's nice, right? Good job, sweetie. I would love to be in love like that again. - Are you ready? - No, not again. Revised and Synchronized by FAST TITLES MEDIA
