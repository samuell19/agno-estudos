Yeah? - Hello, miss! This is Bunty Desai. Get up and pick up the pen. - What's the matter? Agam Diwan has been exposed. 'Rags to riches.' 'Thieves to riches.' So, you like this country? Yes. Very nice, beautiful country. You know, when God was distributing land, we were drinking wine and celebrating life. Thus, we came late, and God said, 'Sorry, I have no land left for you.' We said, 'God, not fair.' He was touched. And He gave us His own land. The land of music, feast and wine. People say it's God's own land. After the war with our neighbours in 2008, things were really bad. We're still suffering. Poor economy, no money. Don't worry, my friend. The fate of this country will change from tomorrow. Take your change. He's leaving! Hey, you! God dressed in a suit! I'm no God. - Then? Confidence, brother. If you have that, you have everything. Hi. - Hello. Interview? - Yes. I thought I'd be alone here. Why's that? - Who'd want to get on a sinking ship? For the last two years, this company is running in loss. Why did you apply to a sinking ship? Well, I have some ideas for this company. The fun is getting into the sinking ship, fix it, take it places, isn't it? Mr Agam? That's me. - Come on! All the best, man! - To you too. Oh boy! It's close. Yes. That's good going. That's good going. Oh... Goal! Ronaldo. Take the pass. Take the pass. Good morning, sir. Morning. Take your seat. - Thank you, sir. Ronaldo! Nice shot! Agam Diwan. Indian origin. You've come for the manager's post? - Yes, sir. Okay. What do you know about this company? Well, for starters, if you stop watching and start playing, this company can go places. - What? A remote can simply change channels, not the company's future. Think big. First, achieve your targets. Then enjoy others' goals. What nonsense! You'll teach us what to do! I won't teach, I will show you. 'The Diwans of the USA. In just five years, ' 'the young lad rose to the pinnacle of success.' 'He's supposed to be the richest Indian, ' 'and he takes over $1.5 billion Georgian Oil Company' What's happening? - 'Sky High Ltd.' 'Over to Sports News.' So what? That means I'm not here for my job, but yours. Hello, friends. Meet Agam Diwan. The MD and CEO of the Diwans of USA. Your new boss. And this is Rahul, my friend, brother and philosopher. Sometimes, a wrong guide. That's me. He'll introduce you to the new company policies. Sorry, sir. Take your seat. Thank you, sir. I know, you've invested your time and efforts in this company. Somewhere along the way, you got lost. Anyway, I'm willing to give you another chance. If you believe in my dreams, join me. Okay? All the best. Let's go. And, yes. There's a young chap sitting outside. - Okay. He'll be the VP-Operations of this branch. That kid? Are you sure? Without taking an interview? Candidates are to be interviewed. Confidence just walks in. Take him on board. Well done, brother! Hear. Let's go! "Everyone from Georgia to Jalandhar is ruined." "The addiction to love is lethal." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." "Everyone from Georgia to Jalandhar is ruined." "The addiction to love is lethal." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." "Girl, you're an electric shock, and I'm a live wire.' "The time and place are right. Set the floor on fire." "Girl, you're an electric shock, and I'm a live wire.' "The time and place are right. Set the floor on fire." "I can't handle this hangover." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." "Everyone from Georgia to Jalandhar is ruined." "The addiction to love is lethal." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." "The heart fancies love, be it here or abroad." Kaya. - Yes, sir. What's the progress on Agam's article? I'm very close to the truth. I've got some very interesting information too. I'm just waiting for the confirmation. Please don't waste your time, okay? Just add a little spice here and there and serve it. Yes, sir. - Before someone else does. And eat this butter, okay? Thank you very much. - Welcome. I'm Kaya. I'm here to meet Mr Agam Diwan. Agam? Do you have an appointment? Well, no. Sorry, you can't meet him until you meet Rahul. Rahul? Hi, I'm Kaya from New York. You got 2 minutes. Shoot. Our magazine has planned an edition on rich and famous Indians. And who better than Agam! We want to feature him. Just a small interview. If you could arrange a meeting, it'd be great! He doesn't waste time on cheap publicity. I'm sorry about the interview. Come on, just 5 minutes. Difficult. Oh really! Is he afraid of the media? People who are honest don't fear such things. Frankly, he doesn't have 5 minutes to waste. On that note, we've been talking for 5 minutes, while you had said 2! Right? Smart! I'll give you his 2 minutes. If you get him talking for a second longer, you can talk to him for as long as you like. Done? Get the meeting fixed. To get him talking is my job. Okay. So, as I was saying... It takes a calculated yet courageous decision to establish a successful business. If you depend on the board of members and committees for every decision and opinion, you can't build your own empire. My dad used to say, 'Truth always triumphs.' It means, truth always wins. If your company is based on the foundation of truth, success is right behind you. As a leader you and you alone have to make those courageous decisions that establish the foundations of an empire. I wish you all the very best. Thank you. Agam, she's a reporter. I've scheduled an interview tomorrow. She had been asking for it for days. I'm Kaya. It isn't easy to get a meeting with you. So, you have 2 minutes. Well, I just have 3 questions. - Shoot. One of the richest Indians, yet no affairs, or love life. How come? You got that wrong. I'm very much in love. In fact, I'm very passionately in love with my career and profession. That's why I am who I am. The media is prohibited from publishing your photos, by law. You sue the ones who do. Why? Because I respect my privacy. Why don't you believe in charity? Isn't it a good cause? Feed a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. But... - Time's up. Thank you. Rahul... - Yeah. Hello, Bunty. I need information. Don't worry about the money. You'll get it on time. Just get me the information. Okay. What else? Fine. Bye. Kaya, please... You listen to me. You wanted 2 minutes. I gave it to you. Now he's too busy. It's not possible. Okay. As you wish. I've sent you a mail. Spare some time from your schedule and read it. The sooner you read, the better for Agam. If you don't have the time, read it in my magazine! Okay? Take care, Rahul. Good luck. Shoot. What is this? What is this nonsense? I'm sure you've heard the saying, behind every fortune, there's a crime. - What? Behind every fortune, there's a crime. Holding a pen doesn't give you the right to print whatever you like. You can't assassinate someone's character. No, Rahul. We use the pen like a spade. We dig deep until we find the truth. That's how I learnt this story. Years ago in Punjab, to be precise, Phagwara... You father Mr Dharampal Diwan borrowed 2 million from his friend to get a visa. Then he made a run for it. Today Satnam's family is facing hard times, while Agam Diwan is one of the richest Indians! So, the point is... This empire of yours was built on the foundation of fraud and deception. Interesting story! I know and it gets better. The hero knows nothing about the story! Or he's feigning ignorance. Am I right, Mr Agam Diwan? And why should we believe it? Well, I've done my job. If you like, investigate it yourself. If this story is a made-up one, you and your tabloid will be in deep trouble. By the way, you both have very little time. Your time stops when our next issue is published. Agam is particular about time, so I guess I'll see you soon. Until then, learn the truth yourselves. Take care, Mr Billionaire. Bye. Agam, you don't have to take these reporters seriously. It's their job to create sensational news. It's all rubbish! They target famous people to become famous. You know, Rahul. I'm standing on top of the tallest building in the country. It's mine. But today, I feel very small. Come on, Agam. Rahul, I want to know about that family. Who was she talking about? You know, my dad was an honest man. He made me what I am. For the first time, his integrity has been questioned. You don't know how painful that is. If she's right, I'm ready to give half of my wealth to that family. And I mean that. Frankly speaking, you can buy out that tabloid company. You can end that reporter's career. It will all be buried. Why go into all this? - What next? Will the truth be buried? Will the truth change? No matter how hard or how fast you try to run from the truth, you can never hide from it. Find out the truth, Rahul. Please! Do it for me. Do it for my dad. After Satnam had died, they sold the house in Punjab, and moved to their ancestral home in Himachal. Name. Luvleen. She's always with the neighbour's child, Laddu. Laddu, you took my phone again! Are you updating a Facebook status? You don't use your phone properly. But I do. I like to use all the features. Really? Any ideas for the school? Looking for them. Look at my status. #Donate-for-school. What an awesome tweet! Give it to me. I have to make a call. No! Listen... Don't call anyone. I want the phone. Hello. This is Luvleen from Abhinandan Vidya Mandir. Yes, about the donation. Actually... Sorry? What? That is so rude! If I ever see you in person, I'm going to kill you! Did you hear that? He's ready to kick the bucket but won't stop flirting! What's wrong? - Those disgusting people... Enough of seeking donations. Aren't you ashamed of begging? What's wrong with that? You know the state of the school. You needn't run that school. Earlier people would seek help from us. Look at us now! You're begging for charity from people! Grandma, I do that to run grandpa's school. It was his dream, right? What's the matter, dad? You're dressed ridiculously! Couldn't you dress decently? You needn't carry a guitar always to become a rock star. Come on, dad. Let me breathe. Why did you call me? You know, music is your passion. You need some pain for it. I was wondering how to mix passion with pain. You know, get married. What? - Yes, get married. That way you'll have passion and pain. Both yours and my dreams will come true. Dad, you're looking at marriage proposals for me again? I'm not looking. I have actually promised someone. My friend's daughter is returning from Canada. Meet her once. I'm sure you'll like her. - Okay, dad. Excuse me, sir. Someone's here to see you. Take them to the guest room. - Okay, sir. Go and present yourself musically. - Sure, dad. Hi. - Hi. Arjun. What's your name? - Luvleen. Luvleen! Luvleen! Sorry? Is there a problem? No, it's fine. Please sit. It's terribly hot outside. - Yes. The AC's on inside. - Yes, it is. Yes. There's no AC outside. - Right. Well, why don't you ask something? Well, do you play the guitar? Guitar... No, it matches my grey socks! Sorry? Just kidding. Music is my passion. Do you like music? Of course! But my only passion is my school and collecting donations for it. Donation? - Yes. I run a small school. Students' books, uniforms, stationery... They cost a lot. So, I'm expecting a significant donation from you. You know what? Actually... Dad manages the finance. Wait here. I'll speak to dad and come back. Okay. No, you'll get the minimum wages. Yes, don't worry about that. - Dad! Just hold on. - What a girl! I told you so. Social work and all! Not funny. Meaning? - She was talking about some donation for poor kids' education. Oh, donation! That's the latest trend. Every rich person associates with NGOs. You know it makes the rich look humble. 100,000 rupees. Give it to her. Thanks, dad. Consider it an investment. No, the consignment will leave tomorrow. Yes. But, Michael, we haven't received the money yet. Hi, uncle! - Hold on. Hi, Sonia. How are you, dear? - I'm good. Where's Arjun? - I don't know. Was he not with you? - No, he wasn't. Anyway, wait for 2 minutes. - Thank you. I'll be here. - Okay. I hope this will be sufficient. - Of course. This means so much to me. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Hello. - I'm so... Who are you? - Sir... Who are you? Sir, I'm Luvleen. I'm here to seek donation for Abhinandan Vidya Mandir. What? - Yes? Donation? - Yes. We don't give donations. Abhinandan Vidya Mandir! Please leave. I don't have time to waste. - But... Come inside. Donations... - Sir... Luvleen, I'm really sorry for what happened. No problem. I'm used to this. Good morning, miss. - Good morning. Good morning, miss. - Good morning. Laddu, why are all the kids out? Is there no class now? Mr Prabhat has resigned. - Why? I adjust with you. Others don't. I see. One should love teaching. Fine, I need to look for teachers along with donations. I told Rahul to find out the truth. But I wasn't at peace. I couldn't be at peace in America with a burdened heart. So, I came to India. Agam, I still can't digest this. Half of your wealth? That's too much money! They must've never imagined that amount! Take it easy, Rahul. I've decided. No going back. If things go well here, I'll try to buy the house in Punjab for them. Rahul! It's strange that dad never mentioned Satnam. Maybe he didn't want to. You told me, he and his wife died in a car crash in Delhi. Am I right? Yes. That's why that girl lives with her grandma. Sad. I know how that feels. How far is the school? - Not very far. Okay. Let's unpack. We have work to do. I think my hash tag found an applicant! - What? Yes. A new teacher is outside. - Really? Yes. - Send him in. Okay. Sit. Do you have your papers? Papers? Didn't you get them? I didn't. What are your qualifications? Me? I cleared tenth grade. And you? What? You quit studies midway? Are you here to study? I'm looking for teachers, not students! I'm here from the electricity department. I'm here to cut off the power connection. You haven't paid the bill for the last three months. Please don't do that. Think about the students. I always wanted to do this to a teacher. My teacher would always deduct my marks! What nonsense! Please wait for a week. Please do it for these kids. All right. If you don't pay up by next week, I'll disconnect... No! No, please... Rahul. Wait here. - Okay. I'll go in. - Okay. And now enters the hero! I swear upon Cinemascope, he walks in slow motion! I can hear music in the background. What a cinema! I've to inform Luvleen. What's your name? - Agam. Agam, show me your CV. CV? Interview without a CV? Will you tell me your qualifications at least? You look smart, but this is no modelling agency. What are your qualifications? How does that matter? - What confidence! Do you want a job without CV and interview? Actually, it's not that... - What are you muttering? Do you have a recommendation letter? Recommendation? What for? I don't get it. This is what happens when you're not prepared. A teacher's job is no fashion show. You can't dress as you like. A school is no place for wasting time. Sorry, I wasted your time. Yes... - I'll leave. Was I too rude? Listen... - Yes? Agam. I think I can give you a chance given your confidence. I like it. Come back tomorrow. If you do well, you may continue. Okay? - Okay. I can't offer you a high salary. We'll start with 7,000 rupees. I'll increase it based on your performance, okay? Okay. Very good. Come tomorrow at 7 am sharp. 7 am sharp? - Is there a problem? No problem... I got it. Lazy! Will you wake up if someone yells in your ears? Yes. Laddu, go. - I won't go there to yell! Go and get that 'tick-tock' device. Listen... You're a teacher now, so dress accordingly. Please. - Here you go. This device wakes people from deep slumber. Set the alarm and sleep, okay? Okay. Hey professor, don't forget to put in batteries. Okay. - Bye. Bye. 'Who was she?' 'She touched my heart like a gentle breeze.' So, how was it? It was good. I got the job. Job? You went to give a cheque, right? Yes, I cashed the cheque. I'll get a salary from tomorrow. Teacher Agam. Salary: 7,000 Indian rupees. How much would that be in dollars? Around $117. Nice. Why didn't you tell her the truth? Instead of revealing your identity, you took up the job? What's going on in your mind? We're here on a mission. - I know, Rahul. You know, when she started talking, I couldn't even react. I was floored! Think about it. If you tell someone suddenly that he has become a billionaire, how would he react? Hi, you're a billionaire. You're a billionaire. You're a billionaire. You know, she won't listen to me if I'm dressed like this. She's just too simple and rooted. You know, You know, I'll have to be like her and tell her the truth in a style she can relate to. You know what I mean? I don't know how to talk some sense into you. I mean, you don't know how many things are pending. Our clients and meetings have been put on hold. I don't know how to handle this. They're calling me... - Have this. Quiet. Now you listen to me. I want to experience how a common man lives with just 7,000 rupees a month. You have to do two things for me. One, get in touch with my hair stylist ASAP. Two, brief the R&D department to give me a brief on the looks of a simple Indian teacher. Okay? Eat it. How about this? - - To make a rich man look like a common man isn't a joke. Tough job. Good morning, teacher. Good morning. Please sit. 'Mr Agam Diwan, ' 'you should've told the truth yesterday.' 'In today's competitive world, ' 'the moral compass has taken a beating over ambition.' 'So, if ambition is not regulated by ethics...' Well, students, I'm your... I'm your new teacher who'll be teaching you now onwards. Which topic shall we study today? Our India. Okay. When do we celebrate independence day? Sir! - Yes? 15th August. You mean, 4th of July? No, sir. Alright, so 15th it is. 15th August is... What's the date today? 19th. So what is 19 minus 4? 15... - 15. That's why it's 15th August. Correct? 'You're in the soup, Agam!' 'This is India, not America.' 'Come prepared tomorrow.' 'India is great.' Done? Yes. Shall we leave? - One second. You lecture well. I learnt from you. When did I lecture you? That's not what I meant. You know, I'm sorry I was rude. - That's fine. It wasn't intentional. - Okay. You teach very well. I saw how engrossed the kids were. Thank you. So, we're paying you 7,000 rupees for now. The thing is, we had a budget of 10,000 rupees. But we're short of money now. I'll give you a raise later. Actually, we're low on funds to run the school. I keep asking for donations from people. - I see. I've an appointment tomorrow. Mrs Sabharwal has called me. You have a way with words. Come along, okay? Me? - - Of course. Wear the bright clothes you wore the other day. - Yes. Okay. What is it? What happened to your car? Here, I cleaned it. Yes, go now. I scared him! Where are you put up? The Monarch Hotel... - Behind Monarch Hotel. In Janta Colony, right? - Yes. How much rent do you pay? 1,500 rupees to 2,000 rupees? The rest can be spent on food. You can manage. 7,000 rupees is a good amount. You'll manage. It is. - Yes. Be on time for the meeting tomorrow. Don't forget the shiny clothes. Okay. Just a little... Here you are! I was looking for you. Where are my shiny clothes? Shiny? No, I meant my Armani suit. Armani suit? I gave it to Sher Singh. He really liked it. Gave it? Agam, you don't repeat your clothes. What? I need the suit ASAP. What? Let's go. Where from? - There. Hurry up. - I'll be back. Sher Singh! Where do I look for him? He must be there. There he is. Sher Singh! Come soon. Sher Singh! - Sher Singh, where's my suit? Well, sir... - Please tell him where the suit is. I lent it to a friend for his wedding. - Wedding? Oh dear! What have you done? Where's the wedding? - Take us there. Come along then. - Hurry up! Where's the groom? Right there. - Come along. He's relieving himself! - Hurry up. Thanks, Mrs Sabharwal, for making time to meet us. You agreed to donate. Actually, my grandpa started this school. It was his dream to educate all the children of this village. But we have no funds to run the school. We pin our hopes on people like you. Your thoughts are good. I'm impressed. Actually, I got to say something else. - Okay. I wish to spread the message of my idol amidst youngsters. And he believes in one thing, charity makes people lazy. Sorry? Why so? He's one of the richest Indians, Mr Diwan. But... You know, he opines that people who don't earn their living become lazy. If we help them, they will increase in number. I just wanted to tell you, don't take donations. Discourage charity and encourage hard work. What? - Mrs Sabharwal, excuse me. May I say something? - Yes. I think Mr Diwan has some problem. I mean, he probably has some issue against helping others. Agam! - No... I think, he doesn't want others to be as successful as him. Mrs Sabharwal, if he were a great person, he'd guide people well. Give better advice. He'd share his failures and save people from failing. From what you said about him, I think he's a selfish and self-centred person. Agam! - No... Either that or you misunderstood his words. What? Who do you think you are? What's your status? You're here to beg for donation, and you're lecturing me! The daily wages of that man's servants is way more than your entire salary. First, earn big bucks. - Sorry, Mrs Sabharwal. Don't go about lecturing on charity. Got it? Mrs Sabharwal... - Listen... Mrs Sabharwal, please... Your cheque, sir. What rotten luck! I thought we'd get something. We got into trouble instead of getting donation. The grocery money... One moment. Did you notice something? - What? That car is following us for many days. Is it? - Yes. No, you're mistaken. It must be a different car. It's the same car. I'm sure. I think it's tailing me. Hurry up. You! Have you no manners? How rude... Such people should be slapped so hard, they'd give up driving for life! Fools! My sweet grandma keeps polishing the photo frames! Try polishing the floors sometimes! I'll do it. - Good. Are you expecting the prince of Patiala? I always dreamt a prince charming would sweep you off your feet. There's no sign of a prince! Grandma, forget those fairy tales. I'll leave if you so wish. All right. Did you get the grocery I gave you money for? Your prince charming will get the grocery! Prince? - What? Never mind. Give me the grocery items. Son, will you do me a favour? Please, put that box down for me. - Okay. Give this to me. - Here. It's kept up there. Great! The scene is set. The hero will climb the stool and hold the box confidently. Confidence is good, over confidence is not. He touched the box and the heroine entered! The hero loses confidence, falls off the stool, and lands in her arms! What are you doing here? Grandma said... Catch me... Wait, I will catch you... Arjun! How come you're here? Hi, Luvleen. - Hi. I have a surprise for you. - What? I've arranged for donation. What? Donation? The date for the show has been fixed. I thought of inviting you. You have to come. Wow, that's great. I'll surely come. Meet Agam. He's the new teacher at the school. Hi. Arjun. - He's our lucky charm. This is Arjun, a talented singer, musician and a friend. So, he'll be too famous to see us, ordinary people, then. Of course. Attend the show first. Agam, you have to come as well. Luvleen, 25% of the profit will be given to your school. 25? - Yes. May your show be a great success! - Thanks. Agam, do come. Pray for us. So, our case will be stronger. - Sure. What's this? We're just 3 and there are 300 empty seats! That's unfair! Bad luck doesn't seem to stop following you. I think no one will come to the show. We'll go back empty-handed. I'm telling you. Let's leave right away. Be quiet! You talk too much. Luvleen, don't worry. People will come. We're probably early. Poor Arjun, he's a talented chap. God! Hope people come. Sit here. - I'll make a call and be back. Now? - Just 2 minutes. Give me a drink. Yes, Agam? Rahul, what about the tickets? Did you buy them? Dude, I bought all the tickets. That's not a problem. I can't distribute them though. Look, I don't care how you do it. This auditorium should be full. Do this. Give tickets and taxi fare too. Return fare. And give some money for food too. Look, Rahul, I don't care about the cost. I want this place full, okay? Okay. Don't worry, I'll do it. "God, please tell me" "why my eyes weep." "God, please tell me" "why my eyes weep." "How do I bear the burden of shattered dreams?" "How do I bear the burden of shattered dreams?" "My fingers bear the scars of hurt." "My fingers bear the scars of hurt." "God, please tell me" "why my eyes weep." "We've come a long way together." "In your company, every moment becomes precious." "It's not easy to stay away from the one you love." "It's not easy to stay away from the one you love." "I have only your memories now." "I have only your memories now." "God, please tell me" "why my eyes weep." "The day we parted," "I felt destiny disowned me." "No shop in the world heals wounds of fate." "No shop in the world heals wounds of fate." "My fingers bear the scars of hurt." "God, please tell me" "why my eyes weep." Hi, guys. Hi, Arjun. - Hey. Hey, Arjun. - Hey, Agam. How are you? Hey, Laddu. - Hi. Thanks for coming, guys. I thought no one would turn up. Come on! It was a brilliant show. Thank you so much. As promised, a small present. Hope this will be of help. Thank you so much, Arjun. - You're welcome. Hey, Arjun! What a great performance! Brilliant. Thank you so much. By the way, that's my friend Luvleen. Agam. Hello. - That's Sonia. Hi, Sonia. - Hi. You're very lucky to have Arjun as a friend. Really? What's so special about him? Nothing. - Nothing? He gave 25% of the profit to my school. Come on! Okay, Arjun. I'll take your leave. Come, Laddu. Bye, Arjun. - Bye. Arjun, what's this? You're talented. Why are you looking after orphans? What are you going to prove? - What nonsense! How can you say such a thing? Arjun, wake up. Do you know how your hard-earned money is used? They must be living off the donation. I can't believe you stooped so low! Say what you like. I want to promote your talent. I want you to become somebody, but you... You're wasting time with worthless people. Thanks, Sonia. I can take care of myself. Let's go. Hello. - Hi, Luvleen. Yes. I called to invite you for my birthday on the 24th. I'm throwing a small party. If you come, it'll be great! No excuses. We'll say 'same to you' on that day. Means you? - Yes. My birthday also falls on the 24th. That's brilliant! Let's celebrate together. Do get your friends along. Please tell Agam he's invited too. Okay? Okay, bye. Laddu, yellow flower? I didn't do my homework. - That means #bribe? It's Luvleen's birthday. She loves yellow flowers. Who sent this? I don't know, miss. I am just a delivery guy. Okay. Hi, Agam. - Hi, Luvleen. Happy birthday. Thank you. Wow, you are here bang on time. You're dressed like a good boy. Perfect for the party. - Thank you. Look at this. Arjun sent this in the morning. He was the first to wish me. So sweet of him. - Yes. What did you get? Me? It's a surprise. Shall we? Hope you're enjoying. It's my son's birthday. Happy birthday, Arjun. - Happy birthday. Yes, the show was great. Hope it works... Hi, Luvleen. What brings you here? Actually, Arjun... - He's busy. He has invited some eminent people. He's busy entertaining them first. Why are you here? - Well, Arjun invited me. He must've done that as a formality. You thought he was serious? But why are you after him? Can't you just leave us alone? Ever since he donated money, you're clinging to him! Anyway, now that you're here, partake in the feast and then go. Come on, Agam. Let's go. What's wrong? I want to go home. Luvleen, it's your birthday too. Let's celebrate. Smile. What do I tell you, son? This girl is ill-fated. It wasn't always so. Her grandpa was a landlord in the village. Those days, inviting us was a matter of pride for people. People used to respect us a lot. People would never leave empty-handed from our house. But in time, we lost almost all our wealth. And now, she has to put up with such problems! How much can that poor girl bear? At my age, I am not much help to her. Things will be fine, grandma. These bad times won't last long. Grandma, you make nice coffee. Bless you, son. Thanks for the dinner. I should be thanking you instead for making my birthday special. Your special surprise gift... Yes. Where is it? Actually, I used my contacts and approached a big company for donation. They've agreed to meet us. In fact, we will meet them tomorrow. Great! Thank you, Agam. I'll meet them on one condition. What? You will keep mum, okay? Promise. Come on! Hello. - Hello. Yes, I'll call you back. You run a school? With great difficulty. I mean, how long have you been running it? Many years. My grandpa started that school. - That's great. Education should be free. Why do you need money to run the school? Sir, if you ever visit our school, you'll know. Everything from the roof to the walls is falling apart! The kids hail from poor families. Their food, books, and uniforms are provided by us. Fair enough. Will 25 suffice? 25,000? Yes. That will suffice for a month or two. - Good. Luvleen, sir didn't mean 25,000, but 2.5 million. - What? Yes, Yes. 2.5 million. Sir, that's a lot! - I know. Sir, you were saying something about arranging a picnic for the kids. Sorry, I completely forgot. Our company will take your staff and kids for a special picnic. All the kids will spend the day as a prince or a princess. Royal treatment, you see. That's awesome. Thank you so much, sir. - My pleasure. Thank you, sir. Shall we leave? - 2.5 million. Thank you, sir. - Thank you. Thank you, sir. - Thank you. Agam, I can't believe it. Congrats, Luvleen! "Relations leave." "Love stays forever." "Fondness fades away." "Love adds everlasting colours." "It's both sweet and sour," "love adds spice too!" "It's both strong and dull. It's fake and genuine." "Love is beautiful!" "Love..." "Love..." "Love..." "Love..." "The night embraces the dawn." "May hearts in love become one forever." "It's plain as the morn and silky as the nights." "Love is forgetful too." "It's both strong and dull. It's fake and genuine." "Love is beautiful!" "Love..." "Love..." "Love..." "Love..." She looks happy. - Yes. The kids are also enjoying. Don't you think you should tell the truth? You're a businessman. You never follow your heart. My dad would always say even if I learn the American ways, he'll marry me off to a Punjabi woman! Luvleen, are you happy? Agam, you have no idea how happy I am. I don't know how to thank you. I proved to be of some use! Stop joking. You fulfilled my biggest dream in life. If you have any other dream, tell me. I have many dreams. Not all dreams can come true. Some are simply meant to make you happy. The school's problem is solved. - Yes. Ask something for yourself. I have no such wish. Fine. Suppose I am the almighty. That I am God. If I were to grant you one wish, what would you ask for? Really? Are you God? Can I ask you for anything? Try me. - Okay. It's said, when God grants wealth, he makes people heartless. But there's a man, who has both in abundance. I like him. - Who? Arjun. God, I want him to propose to me. Possible? What happened? Are you scared? I know Arjun can never be mine. I don't match up to his family's stature. Silly me! Okay. As you wish. You'll see... Within 7 days, Arjun will propose to you. I promise you. - Do you realise what you're saying? Of course, I do, I'm God! Really? All right then, your time starts now. "Hold hands forever and be one." "Let's make a world of our own." "It needs no shelter and shies away from nothing." "Love is innocent." "Relations leave." "Love stays forever." "Fondness fades away." "Love adds everlasting colours." "Love..." "Love..." I was just wondering. We did nothing like this in college. No affairs, no link-ups. Strangely, today we are thinking of ways to bring two hearts closer. That's called unconditional love. Love is about helping your beloved find true love. Sacrifice? Call it whatever you want. We somehow have to bring Arjun and Luvleen together. At any cost... No worries, Agam. I'll put some experts to work. Thanks. Hello. Who's this? Arjun? - Yes. Hi, this is Rahul from Red Stereo Studios, New York. We saw your performance. And we like your work. I must say you have a brilliant voice. - Thank you, sir. We want somebody like you in our upcoming project. We'd like to discuss it with you. The best thing is I'm in the city right now. Wow, sir. When can we meet up? As soon as possible. Come over today. Sure, sir. I can come over. - Yes? I'll text you the address. - Sure, sir. Thank you. Red Stereo Studios? Which company is that? It's ours. - Ours? We started yesterday and have initiated the paperwork. The main branch is in New York... We have an office here too. Wow, that was quick. - I know. When are you meeting him? Now. I'll see you in the evening. - See you. Yes? Arjun. - Hi, sit. Thanks. - You know what... A girl visited us. A friend of yours and a huge fan of music. She showed us your video. I must say you are very talented. Thank you, sir. So, our company has decided to sign a contract with you and cut an album. That girl is silently promoting you. I hope you know her. - Yes, sir. I know her. Okay, sir. - All the best. Thank you. Hi, dad. Hi. Dad, I think I was wrong about Sonia. I misunderstood her. Wow! Change? How so? Dad, she wanted to help me, but I thought she was kidding. I've got a great offer, all thanks to her. I think I can marry her. Wow, great! That's like my son. All right. We'll fix an engagement date. But, dad, it's too soon. Why delay an auspicious occasion? The sooner, the better. No use wasting time. Have an apple. We have to finance teachers. Then the renovation of school... - Miss... Now that you're doing this, please raise my salary as well. Really? Why, Mr God? One day is over. You haven't done magic yet. When will I see God's magic? God promised, right? - Yes. Just wait and watch. You'll see, Arjun will call today. Let's see. Arjun! I told you so. Answer it. Hello. What's wrong? Arjun... He... He called to invite me. Invite for? For his engagement with Sonia. Rahul! - Yes? You spoilt everything. - What? How could you goof up? What? - Luvleen! She's shattered! Relax, I don't get you. What's done is done. Think of something else. - What? We have to stop this engagement quick. Okay. We have to stop the engagement? Sit, we'll do something. - Sit? Calm down. Now you want to call off the engagement. Fine. To do that, one of them has to disappear. Kidnapping? No kidnapping. We can't do that. Contract. Contract? - Yes. Contract. Hello. - Hi, Arjun. This is Rahul. Hope it's the right time to talk to you. Sure, sir. Our chief promotion officer from New York has come to Mumbai. You'll have to fly to Mumbai to sign a contract. Contract? - Yes. I mean, no social gatherings, functions and public appearance until we're done recording. Sure, sir. I'm willing to sacrifice anything for a music album. Arjun, I heard you're getting engaged. The ring can wait, sir. I want to sing. Good. The ring can wait! I got to know Arjun's engagement has been postponed. You know everything! I'm God! It's just postponed. You needn't be happy about it. Arjun, how was Mumbai? All good? Very good. The manager was cooperative. The manager enjoyed the meeting with you. Please... Thank you, sir. And, one more thing. - Yes, sir? The girl helping you doesn't want you to know about this. I hope you understand. Sure, sir. I'll be careful. - Good. I'll leave now. - Okay. Thank you, sir. Did she get the donation? Donation? Yeah. Which donation, sir? That girl came here seeking donation for the school. That's when she showed me your video. You know, all that stuff. Sir, you did me a favour by telling me this. And, thank you so much. Don't assume that I forgot. I didn't. Really? I didn't say anything. Just saying. I know what you're thinking. Don't worry. Things will be fine. Trust me. Really? Will he call again today? He won't call, but come to see you. He'll come to see me? That seems like a far-fetched dream. Arjun, all of a sudden? I have good news. - What? Your prayers worked, and I got a great offer. - Really? I'm cutting an album with Red Stereo Studios. I'd never imagined it. Congrats! What awesome news! I'm really happy for you. Thank you. Now I'll manage to donate to your school. You needn't do that. We've arranged for a huge donation. Our monetary problems are solved for the time being. Thanks, Arjun. - That's great! So, there's nothing left for me to do, right? Actually, there's something you can do. You can teach and practice all the same. I didn't get you. Well, there's no music teacher in the school. You could teach music to our students. Can you spare one hour? What say? Nice offer. That's so cool! You like it? - It's a dream come true! Teaching guitar to kids... "The day we parted," "I felt destiny disowned me." "The day we parted," "I felt destiny disowned me." "No shop in the world heals wounds of fate." "No shop in the world heals wounds of fate." "My fingers bear the scars of hurt." "My fingers bear the scars of hurt." "God, please tell me" "why my eyes weep." "How do I bear the burden of shattered dreams?" "How do I bear the burden of shattered dreams?" "My fingers bear the scars of hurt." "My fingers bear the scars of hurt." Teacher, hope there are seven days in a week for you as well. Things will happen on time. Give me some time to do magic. Stop building castles in the air. I'm bound be hurt in the end. 'I wish I could tell you' 'how painful these days are even for God.' 'Yet...' Cheers! - Cheers! You know, Arjun, my success lies in yours. Way to go! You know, Luvleen... She loves you. - Really? Rahul, who does things for others selflessly? She's struggling to fulfil your dreams. I don't know. You think so? I don't think so. I know so. She wants you to be successful. If you ask me, she's one in a billion! I really don't know. I've no idea when I fell for her. See, I told you so! I try to relive that moment. When I close my eyes, I see her smiling face. That's love. But how do I tell her? What do you mean? Arjun, when hearts converse, let the minds rest. Go and tell her. - Sure? Sure. I'm certain. Tell her. Go, Arjun! Luvleen. Luvleen. Luvleen. I love you. "My eyes are moist." "My life seems aimless." "My heart is filled with sorrow when you leave me alone." "You're my words and life." "You're the reason I believe in love." "You're the reason I pray." "You mean the world to me." "I weep as I try to forget you're not mine." "No matter what I do, I end up crying." "This is what happens in love." "I find no reason to be happy." "This heartache refuses to leave me." "Your memories lie deep in my heart." "My love for you grows like roses in full bloom." "Everything seems strange when the heart is wounded." "No matter what I do, I end up crying." "This is what happens in love." Kaya, thank you so much for mentally disturbing a simple and honest man. Agam could've pulled himself out of this mess. But he didn't do that. He came all the way to India to make amends for his dad. What do you care? You just want to write juicy stuff for your magazine. I don't know why I am telling you this. But be happy. God bless you. Agam! I don't know how you did this. What? Arjun proposed to me. Luvleen, he always loved you. He was just waiting for the right moment. Come on! Listen. - Yes? You live in Janta Colony, right? Yes. I'll be coming there tomorrow. I've to go and see a student who's unwell. I see. - Won't you invite me home? Home? - Let's have tea. Of course! What's your address? Address? - Yes. Address... I don't know the address. I'll give it to you over the phone later. Bye. Yes, Agam? - Rahul, there's an emergency. Arrange a house for me. There's a colony behind our hotel. Arrange a one-room house quickly. What? A house in Janta Colony? There's not much time. Just do as I say. Also, the timepiece... - Timepiece? Make sure you put it there, okay? I'll call you later. - I'll manage. Okay, bye. - Yes. He's so strange! Everything sorted. Bye. Okay, bye. - Bye. Hello. I've told you many times not to make 'Gobi parathas'. Why don't you understand? Hey, Rahul! Sorry, man. You saved me. How's the business going? You remember the business? - Yeah, right. What are you doing here? Well, I live in Janta Colony. In these slums? You stay here and dare to call names at Mr Diwan! Let's go. Who was this rude woman? She? A fan of mine. Why was she angry? She is cheesed off about something. Forget about her. I don't have the notes teacher gave. Do you have them? Laddu. - Yes? Where's Luvleen? - She hasn't come today. Luvleen, what's the matter? Arjun's dad rejected our alliance. Luvleen, you're worrying unnecessarily. Arjun really loves you. He doesn't need his dad's wealth now. He loves you a lot. He can leave everything for you. I know, Arjun will leave everything for me. But I don't want that to happen. I know how it feels to live without your family. It's an insult of love. Luvleen, you never know. We'll find a way out. Arjun's dad might give in. You have high hopes, Agam. Not really. You just wait and watch. Things will be fine. Smile. Tell me. I've to discuss a personal matter with you. Personal? - Yes. Go ahead. Well, it's about your son Arjun's marriage. Arjun's marriage? Why are you interested? Actually, I'm his friend Agam. Well, Agam, you don't know your friend well. What do you know about him? I'm his father. I know he's not interested in marrying right now. He's focusing on music. I know about his passion. And his love too. In fact, Luvleen and Arjun truly love each other. And to be honest, I think they're made for each other. Young man, that's young blood. Love affairs are common at this age. But marriage is a serious thing. Marriages happen when the status is equal. Money does matter or marriages don't last. Sir, I understand. What if I tell you, Luvleen is worth $250 million? $250 million! Are you mad? What are you saying? Who will give her that amount? I will. I owe her. That's what she's bringing in the marriage. By the way, who are you? Sir, Diwan. Agam Diwan. Agam Diwan. Diwans of USA. - Yes, sir. How do I trust you? Your money will be transferred. When? - Tomorrow morning. Gentleman, why are you interested in this girl? That's a different story, sir. But this should remain between us. Okay. That's a deal. - Thank you. Hello, Luvleen. - Agam, guess what? Arjun's dad has agreed to get us married. Are you listening? I'm so happy. Guess what? We're getting married next week. Agam, thank you so much. Luvleen, congrats. I told you so. - I'll call later. Lots of things need to be taken care of. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. "Every moment seems strange." "It feels as if life has no meaning." "My eyes are moist, and the tongue is silent." "My life ended right where you left me." "My dreams were shattered by the one I dreamt of." "Now, nothing can ease my pain." Hello, grandma. - Hello, son. Is Luvleen home? - No. She's gone to get dressed for her wedding. She's very happy. So am I. Come in. - Okay. I'll tell you something. Ever since you came, good things are happening. Grandma... I'm leaving today. So, I came to see you one last time. You're leaving! Sit here. Grandma... - Sit! What do you mean you're leaving? You should be helping with the wedding preparations. No, grandma. I got a good job offer. I have to join tomorrow. Can't you wait for a day? Give me your phone. I'll speak to them. No, grandma. Today's the wedding. There's no greater joy. You're right, but... Grandma, is that Luvleen? Yes. That's her last picture with her parents. Grandma, do you have more photos? I do. Do you want to see? - Yes. Come with me. Come on! Come, sit. Here. I keep this with me. Whenever I feel lonely, I revisit the old memories. It's very dear to you. These are old memories. I was thinking, if these people were alive, they'd be very happy. Look, this is Luvleen's grandpa. This was taken after we got married. These are Luvleen's parents. That's Luvleen when she was 2-3 years old. She loved driving. The other photo is of Dharampal, the cheat. He's standing with his son in the picture. He stabbed us in the back. He's responsible for the state we are in today. Grandma, is this Dharampal? Yes. How can I forget him? Grandma, was there any other person named Dharampal? No. Grandma, please think again. Yes, there was. Dharampal of the Highway. He was a nice man. There's a highway close by. The government was constructing it then. His land was around that spot. The government bought his land. He got 2 million for it. He sold the land and went abroad with his family. We never heard of him after that. After many years, we learnt of his son's achievements. He has become very rich. Grandma, thank you. What happened? - It's time. I'll leave. Sorry, dad. Agam and Dharam... Listen, son... Listen up! Agam, let's go back. There's no place for people like us here. Let's go back to happiness. Rahul, what Kaya said was wrong. I doubted my dad because of her. That wasn't right. Yes, Rahul? - Good news. You and your company are in deep trouble. You wrongly accused Agam's dad. The guilty man was someone else. Rectify now. Sir! Hi. - Hello. Sir, I'm ready with my article. It's time to tell the world about the richest Indian. A man of his word. A large-hearted man who rose from rags to riches with sheer hard work. Cover story with a cover photograph of him. Congratulations, Kaya. - Thank you. Really good job. - Thanks. Luvleen! Luvleen! Luvleen! Agam, where are you? You vanished. What kind of a friend are you? You're coming to the wedding, right? Hope you remember I'm getting married today. Actually, I bagged a new job. I'm leaving today. I was busy packing. I'm sorry, I can't come. Hope you understand. Is this a joke, Agam? Can't you wait for a day? How can you just leave? Listen, if you need money, I'll give you a raise. Luvleen, it's not about the money. I'm sorry. I really have to go. What's this? Now that things are fine, you're leaving... No, you can't. You'll come. I'll be waiting for you. Why is Agam doing this? If he didn't want to stay here, why did he help me? It's very simple. He wants you to be happy. - Yes. A true friend would want his friend to be happy. He's my best friend. Luvleen, a girl and a boy, can never be friends. I swear upon cinema! Perhaps... I'm not happy. People never help without a hidden agenda. Why does Agam care so much about me? Why does my happiness matter to him? A little boy like me has understood this. Why can't a teacher like you understand? "My eyes are moist. My life seems aimless." "My heart is filled with sorrow when you leave me alone." "You're my words and life." "You're the reason I believe in love." "You're the reason I pray." "You mean the world to me." "I weep as I try to forget you're not mine." "No matter what I do, I end up crying." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "Every moment seems strange." "It feels as if life has no meaning." "My eyes are moist, and the tongue is silent." "My life ended right where you left me." "My dreams were shattered by the one I dreamt of." "No matter what I do, I end up crying." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." "This is what happens in love." Listen. - Yes. If someone wishes well for another... Compassion. And what if someone is willing to do anything for another? Friendship. If someone misses another like crazy? That's special then. That's love. Arjun. Agam didn't come. He must be held up. He'll come. No. I'm worried. I'm missing him. Dearly? Yes. Close your eyes. Did you see him? - Yes. The one you see behind closed eyes resides in your heart. So... Is this a dress rehearsal? Just go. - What? Yeah. Just go away! Luvleen! Where's that boy who was with you? Why? - I want to see him. Why? - He's Mr Agam Diwan. The richest Indian. I insulted him in my ignorance. I want to apologise. He invested $250 million in the company owned by Arjun's dad, so that you can marry Arjun. Sir! Sher Singh, you may keep this. This key? Your new 3 bedroom flat. But... - It's a gift. Do me a favour. Don't ever sell this room. - Okay. May I go in? - Sure. "Tears reside in my eyes." "Loneliness engulfs my life." "Tears reside in my eyes." "Loneliness engulfs my life." "My prayers were half answered." "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." "It passed by." "Why was I left lonely?" "It passed by." "Why was I left lonely?" "My forlorn heart is filled with a pain" "that can't ever be eased." "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." "It seemed like a momentary journey." "My simple heart got misled for nothing." "How will I live my life without you?" "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." Sir, we got the clearance for the runway. We shall go. "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." "I got separated from you." "My God turned away from me." Agam! I think God heard your prayers. Why? You're going away for your new job! 7,000 rupees aren't sufficient for you! Is that why you're leaving? What if I give you my salary too? We'll manage, right? Then why are you leaving? Please go. Who's stopping you? Marry me. "Relations leave." "Love stays forever." "Fondness fades away." "Love adds everlasting colours."
