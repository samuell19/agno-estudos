'Thanks to press, media internet and social media friends' 'Thanks to Tamilnadu Police Department' 'Paayum Oli Nee Enakku' [You are my beaming light] Tell me, sir. My bike is repaired. Can you drop us on the main road? I've a customer inside. Sir, I've a lady with me. Kindly help. Please come in. Thanks, sir. What happened? The engine stopped. Must push the vehicle to start. - Push the vehicle? - Yes, sir. Excuse me! - When will it start? - In a minute. Boss! How dare you raise hands on me? Three hours already! Forget this client. Let's leave. - Patience. - No way. It's already 5:30. I can't answer your dad. Let's go. Sir, you may go in. Finally! Yeah. Send in that Senior Network admin. Yeah. Thank you. Sir, your server's vulnerability report. Data is wealth. If your competitor gets their hand on your data... then all your hard work done these years, will be in their kitty. But our servers are safe and secure. L2, L3 switch and firewalls are up-to-date. Sorry, sir. The firewall you talk about is like a bike helmet. If someone rams on intentionally, can you guarantee it won't be fatal? We don't have any network threat, like you predict. Correct. You're alive now but what's the guarantee you won't die any moment? - Dude! - Just for a clarity. If even we want to outsource it, why'd we give it to beginners like you? We know people who are more experienced and experts than you. Now, that's a fair point sir. With your permission, may I hack your so called secure server? I thought they'd ask us to get out for what you did. Instead he signed the deal and gave us a cheque. Dude, you're just awesome! - Was this all just a set up? - Shut up and come! Doesn't feel like route to home. You're right. We just signed a huge deal. Calls for a small celebration. Two minutes. I'll be back. - Do you really have to drink? - Yes, dude. Please. I'll be back. - Hope you fixed the drink right. - Of course. Bro, everything is available. Go ahead. - Just a quarter booze. - Make it fast. Thanks. Dude, she just bit me! How dare you bite me? Choke her down! Shut up! Don't shout or else I'll slit your throat. Go and check what is it! Shut up! Get lost! Won't you listen? Damn it! How dare you? That too in our hood! Aravind! Dude, let's run! What's the issue? Who are they? Wait and watch! You'll repent for this! Let's go Come on, dude! I went to buy booze and in that span you'd have committed a murder! The legacy of Tamil Needhi Katchi is well known. In the upcoming by election, my beloved brother and the people's favourite, Paarkadal Sivanesan, will contest in this constituency. The opponent parties might boast about themselves and ask for your votes. But I am not a such a guy. Tamil Needhi Katchi is the people's party. Converse in the golden language of Tamil, at all times. And cast your golden votes to Tamil Needhi Katchi. We will rise up and will strive to rise you up. Thank you. Welcome Mr. Nice guy! Where were you yesterday? You're being mysterious. Mind you! Look at this. Would you like one? I already have a boyfriend! Didn't like it? Why? Planning to gift it to someone else? - So you like it? - Of course. They are here. Let's go. - I'll be downstairs. - Okay. Come on. - Give it to me if you don't like it. - Get lost! Coming month 19th is an auspicious day. The bride and groom's horoscopes are a perfect match. Let's fix it. Fine but we got only 15 days? The groom has to return back to US soon. This date fits the bill for us. Then fix that date. Isn't it too early? - Don't worry, dad. I'll see to it. - See? You? Yes, we'll see to it. Okay. Fine then. Sit. Sir... We never expected this to happen in the meeting. Forgive us. We will increase your security detail. It's alright, he protected me. I have a suggestion. Why not appoint Jeevan as the district secretary? You are right, that will pave the way for him to become MLA and minister. I know to make my own decisions. You all can leave now. Leave. Okay, we'll take leave. Mom, don't you have any other topic to talk about than marriage? So foolish! Uthra! Hello? Are you there on the call? Mom, I got into a lift. Mom, what do you want me to do? They took time out and came all the way to your office. - At least have the decency to oblige. - Fine, hang up now! Good morning, ma'am. Ma'am they are waiting for you. Hi. Please come. No respect! Come on. Arun, I asked Yeshwanth to pick up the lights yesterday. - It's that, right? - Yeah, Uthra. Does it work? - Yet to check it. - Do it at once! - Good morning, Uthra. - Hi, good morning. I had informed to change the garnishing and bouquet for tomorrow's function. Did you update the florist? - Yes, did it yesterday. - Good. Yellow flowers, rose petals, dices and orchids. Did florist deliver them all? Yet to check that. - Come on, be responsible. Do it at once! - Yeah. Sorry. Varun, regarding the wedding at T. Nagar tomorrow... - Please check the generator facilities. - Yeah, okay. - I don't want any complaints. - Okay. Okay, right? So, you've already made up your mind? Yes. If both families are happy then we must get on with the wedding, right? At first sight? That too in this modern times? But it's quite normal, right? It's not just about the groom's consent alone. - Even the bride's consent matters. - Who'd refuse such a perfect groom? He's educated and has good job. Let's talk business. Only 15 days to go for the wedding. I know it's hard to find a marriage hall. I leave that option to you. As far as the decorations are concerned... it must be coral pink and white. Dude, roses. We'll need lots of roses. No artificial roses. It must be freshly picked on wedding morning. That's how my sister likes it. Sir, your going beyond limits. I'm not over the fact about our alliance... and you're already onto stage color? And you want roses freshly picked? Who are you? Nehru's relative? That too your sister must like it? From where did she come in this discussion? Of course! His sister is the bride. The wedding must be how she wants it, right? Isn't this a wedding event company? Told you, this won't work out. Let's leave. Uh-oh! Sorry! Sorry! Please don't mistake me. I mistook you guys for someone else. Very sorry, sir. It's okay. I don't know why are you being so apologetic. - Don't regret. - Why would she regret? We must. After all we got an earful from her. Sir, would you like to check out the stage design? Sister's wedding! My dad, mom and sister; we'll discuss and then make a call. So... Have you submitted your personal details? - Yes, I've. - Then we'll come to your house. - Okay. - Thank you. - Shall we leave? - Yes. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. Bye. Guess you can see everything now! But how? I did not expect this from sir. He calls you his heir, but never treats you like it. He wants you to take care of his business and wealth, you have to protect him with your life. But he will not give you the post. Your are gaining popularity among our local people. He fears that you will contest the election and take his place. There will be million reasons behind his decision. We might not understand it now. But his decision will be right. Sir's calling you. Dad. - Uthra. - Hello. Hi. Welcome. Please. I have brought the designs you asked for. She is the bride. Come, take a seat. You want to see? Take a look. This is good. - This is good. - Okay. It should look special and attractive. - It must be unique. - Sure ma'am. It's a really beautiful house. It's bright. House decoration is included in your package. - So... - Oh! That's nice. It will be better if I take a look around the house. Sure. - I'll bring coffee for you. - Thank you. We'll give it a superb decoration. I have seen few windows in houses. But this house is made up of windows. - Deepika. - Mom? - Come here. - One minute. Okay. Looks like a library. Have you read all these books? You sound like my school teacher. Ask me any questions. I will definitely ask. I am sorry for the miscommunication at the office that day. You already apologized that day. Forget it. You even got this order. Uthra. - Thank you. - It's okay. Are you working for my marriage or your marriage? Quiet. What is she saying? She wants fresh roses? Yes. After all, we come from Nehru family. "Hey baby! You conspired and found your way into my heart." "Enough now! Do not kill me with your naughty tricks." "Hey baby! You entrapped me and made me feel high" "You collided on me, pushing me out of my track" "The chirp of this mesmerizing bird" "Sounds like a heavenly tune to my heart " "My eyes are clouded by your beautiful looks" "You flowed inside me like a invisible light" "You cracked me wide open" "You run amok inside me" "I feel like flying, when you walk close to me" "When she moves away, my heart longs for her " "I lost myself and searched for me in you" "Have I gone crazy? Or does she feel the same about me?" "Oh! The vibe is picking up now" "I am enjoying every moment of it" "My heart is a wick and you are the flame in it" "Oh! When she comes close to me" "Everything bursts out with colour" "Is this right or wrong? I am struggling to find out" "You cracked me wide open" "You run amok inside me" Can you drop us in Guindy? Sorry sir. You need to use the app to confirm the trip. Really? It's 11 PM already. Help us, I will pay you extra. Okay, get in. Fix the car and bring it back. Get in. Let's go. It's for my daughter. It's her birthday tomorrow. She is turning 4 tomorrow. It feels like she was born only yesterday. But it has been 4 years. - Is this your own car? - Stop kidding. It took me a month just to buy this doll. How will I afford a own car? But I will buy one. Owning a car is a pride, right? Don't worry. We'll buy one. Boss is here. Sir... sir... Move. My daughter... She is waiting for me. Poor man. This is cruel. - Yes. - No. No? Yes, it is a poor. It's a pathetic. The man who gave me the project. The bank which trusted me and gave me the loan. For leaving the office in your responsibility for 15 days. I am the pathetic one. Last week was the project deadline. What is your excuse? Don't say a word. I want the project to be done in two days. Don't waste a breath till it's over. No phone break, no Whatsapp, no lunch break, no tea break. Nothing! Got it? You won't need it. No water break either. - Hi Uthra. - Are you busy? I am free. Nothing much to do here. Okay, I am coming there. Can you come down? Coming to see me? Yes, coming now. Project delivery in two days. You can drink water. But don't over drink. Everyone! Project delivery in two days. He will be back by then. My client's parents are celebrating their 50th anniversary. He wished to throw a thematic celebration. 50th anniversary? Wow! What a complete life. Both of them are Tamil lecturers. I thought of making a song to celebrate their life. Doesn't connect right? A Super Power poetry will make it work. You are the book worm. You told me to ask my doubts right? That is why I brought you here. What kind of poem? I tried everything from movie songs to academic poems. But nothing suits. It's for couples celebrating their 50th anniversary. Did you try Bharathiyar poems? Bharathiyar is fine, but... which of his song? 'Thou to me are the flowing Light' 'I to thee the perceiving sight' 'Thou to me the musical Veena' 'I to thee the strumming finger' 'Thou to me the heavenly rain' 'I to thee the jubilant peacock' 'Thou to me the bright moon' 'I to thee the tidal ocean' 'Thou to me eternal love' 'I to thee the enticing magnet' 'Thou to me the sacred Vedas' 'I to thee the imbibing skill' 'The day I attain wisdom...' 'you will be the brimming thought' 'You form is that of a elegant music. You are a noble soul' 'Oh my love!' Is that okay? Okay. You know, after watching these events, I want my parents 60th anniversary, to be a beautiful occasion too. Sure, we will make it even grander. But will you give the even to me? Yeah, sure. But it should not be a private party. It should happen in a public gathering space. Let's say, a temple, where our guests and even strangers can take part. It will have a positive vibe. Youngsters seeing my parents will think of living a happy long life like them. And older people will wish my parents to live longer. I want it to be such an occasion. Can it be done? It's a power cut. I lost track of time in our discussion. How are we going to get back? Come, I'll take you. Come. Sorry Aravind, I need to prepare for the vent tomorrow. - Else I would have dropped you myself. - It's okay, I will manage. Rickshaw. Okay, bye. Take care. - Where to? - Adyar. See you, bye. A cab driver was brutally killed in the highway road last night. Police has informed that his body was recovered from a nearby go down. The police department has launched a thorough investigation on the case. Tell me, sir. I saw the flash news in TV just now. Tell me, sir. My bike is repaired. Can you drop us on the main road? Please come in. What happened? The engine stopped. Must push the vehicle to start. Aravind... Have you noticed, an elephant is tied up to a post using a small rope. If the elephant wants... it cant free itself from that knot in a jiffy and walk off. But it won't even attempt to do that. Guess why? Because they tie it using the same rope ever since it was a calf. As a calf it'll try it's best to free itself. But it cannot. It'll keep trying for long. After a point the wound and pain from trying to break free from that knot... is all that it'll remember. So as a calf, it will believe that it can never break free from that rope. It'll grow into a huge elephant believing... that it can never break free from that knot. So, Aravind... you must believe now, in this young age, that you can achieve any and everything. That's all. Okay? Aravind, you are not blind. You're only partially blind. So, the usual activities of a normal boy... can be done by you too. You've to get trained for that. As simple as that. Maintain your body language like you are any other person who can see. That's it. Okay? No one is a born genius, Aravind. You can definitely shine in anything and everything. Looks like he is back to his senses. He is making noise. Go and finish him off! So, you're up? Other day, I missed my focus a bit and hence you beat me down. You are trapped today! What are you looking at? Hey! Slit his throat. Slit his throat! Do you have a phone? Forget the wallet and watch. Thank Goodness, nothing serious happened to you. It's your dad. - Hello. - Karna, where is Aravind? - Aravind is here with me. - What happened to his phone? He said it was dead. Where are you guys? Well, here... nearby. - Nearby? Where? - Don't tell hospital! - In hospital. - What! Hospital? What happened to Aravind? - Well... - Give it to me. Dad, nothing to worry. I'm on my way to home. I'll be there in half an hour. Make it fast. Dude! Come on! I blabbered out in fear. Dude... I shall also come in. Aren't you done blabbering? You leave. See you. - Aravind! - Yes, dad? What happened? Tell me, what happened? Well, dad. I fell off the bike. Just a minor injury. Fell off the bike? Did you ride alone? Nothing to worry, dad. Dear, was is really an accident? I hope you didn't have a tiff with anybody. Why'd you ask that, dad? - This is a silly matter. - You call this a silly matter? Nothing regarding you is silly to me. Please don't go alone anywhere, hereafter. Okay, dad. Shall I get you some food? No, dad. Karna and I just had food. - You go and get some sleep, dad. Please. - Okay, dear. Tell me, sir. Okay, sir. I have told you, I am not a saint like my sir. Desires, enemies and traitors, we must not do an incomplete job with them. We must promptly finish them. If my chief knows about this, he will not spare your life. Looking at your gruesome death, forget him winning the election, he must be afraid to contest against me. Give that. Don't do this. Aravind... Ma'am, your order. Thanks. What a beautiful view from here, isn't it? Of course, when you can see everything is beautiful... Aravind, I've something to confess but... I don't how and where to begin. I know, Uthra. But I'd like to say something before you confess. It's about me. After I complete, if you still wanna confess... then that is all I need. - Aravind. - Yes, dad? Do you see that house? That is where we are going to live hereafter. - Really? - Look at it, Aravind. Dad! Aravind! We have something called Iris in our eyes. The light passes through the iris and that's how we see things. The main function of the iris is that... it shrinks when the light is too bright... and expands when the brightness is less. During the accident, Aravind's eyes were exposed to too much brightness. Not just that... The impact and shock due to accident... has affected the iris and it has lost it's functionality. So Aravind cannot see what we can see in normal brightness. Aravind can see only when there is more light and brightness. Dad! Thought it was the right time to tell.. Hence, I did. - But Aravind... - Uthra please. Don't make a hasty decision. Don't regret the decision in the future. Think through it, for my sake. Discuss with your mother. Even after that if you feel your decision is right... then call me. I shall wait. 'It's a power cut.' 'How are we going to get back?' 'Come, I'll take you.' You did the right thing, Aravind. Uthra will definitely understand you. Even if she will understand me... but what about her family? That too... someone like me. What do you mean by 'someone like me'? Look here, Aravind. You've already given the perfect answers to the questions her mother might rise. Who else would do that? They must be lucky to have you. We need work on the project's budget, isn't it? We'll fix the final amount based on that. We want maximum safety and security. And also we need a trusted firewall to be installed. That's why we are here. Hello. Aravind, where are you? At office. - I'd like to meet you. - Sure, let's meet. - I'll come down. - Fine. Okay. Sir... I'll do the updates you asked for and get back to you. - Sounds okay to us. Thank you. - Thank you. - Aravind. - Yes, dad? Uthra called me. I'm on my way to meet her. Told you. Everything will fall in place for you. Dad? Dad, what happened? - Hold on. - Stop the car! Aravind, some thugs are trying to kill me! Don't stop the car! Keep driving. Where are you? Share me your live location! I'll come. Okay, dear. Catch him! - Stop the car! - You heard us! Stop! - Go! Go! Near him! - Stop! - I said, stop the car! - Catch him! Don't lose him. - Faster! - Don't let him escape! - Come on! - Stop! Corner him, so that he'll go off the road and stop! Go closer! - Go! Go! - Stop the car! Overtake him! Quick! He's getting away. Go! Go! Overtake him! Finish him off! Don't let him escape! Finish him! Come on, guys! Get him! Jerk face! Damn it! Fool! Why are you on the wrong side? Doofus! Crazy fellow! Are you nuts? Dude, watch out! Are you blind? Why'd you come on wrong side? We must just run over him! What's your problem? Crazy fellow! Stop! Bullshit! Are you blind? What happened? Dad? Dad? Aravind... Dad! Dad! Dad! Guys, let's leave. Dad? Dad! Dad... Dad! Boss... that blind fellow is hugging his father's corpse and crying. Well, crying is not going to solve anything. Tell me what happened, only then I can take action accordingly. Only you were with him when he died. The case can be further moved based on your statement. Please say something. Sir... he's partially viewing impaired. Oh! Come on! You're the only eye witness and you are blind? Fine, I'll send the writer tomorrow. Whatever he saw... err... no! No! Ask him tell whatever he remembers. Okay, sir. Only then we can investigate, file the findings and press charges. - Got it? - Okay, sir. Dad! Uncle, why is it so dark? - I am scared. - Don't worry. You'll be alright. No problem. I will be here for you. 'Thou to me are the flowing Light' 'I to thee the perceiving sight' 'Thou to me the musical Veena' 'I to thee the strumming finger' 'Thou to me the heavenly rain I to thee the jubilant peacock' 'Thou to me the bright moon I to thee the tidal ocean' 'Thou to me eternal love' 'I to thee the enticing magnet' You must believe now, in this young age, that you can achieve any and everything. That's all. Nothing regarding you is silly to me. Sir! Sir... You? Tell me. Any news on the murderers? A murder must have a motive. As far as we inquired, your uncle has no enemies. We haven't found any evidences yet. You're the only witness who was present during murder. But see... you are blind. Sir, talk responsibly. Come on, I said the truth. Isn't it? You were there and couldn't save him. What can I do now? True, sir. I couldn't do anything. What can you do? Let me get a break through... and I'll inform you. Let's go. Go Brother, please come and eat. Mom... Come on, Aravind. If you sit broken hearted like this... then how do we hold ourselves? This is not new to me. Car accident during childhood. I lost my eye sight. But I wasn't so dejected back then. Because as my uncle and my dad... he was always by my side. Even today, if I'm able to live normally with this condition... then he is the sole reason for it. During childhood, once her told me... that I had resurrected with a boon But I knew back then... he lied to give me hope and strength. To be honest... he was my boon! Until he was by my side, I never regretted or felt anything about my eye sight or the condition. But today? I am angry with myself. Because of not having eye sight... I couldn't save my father! Aravind... Please don't cry, Aravind. I hope you don't have any issue in coming with me. I thought you'd be consoling them but instead it was other way around. Life has to move on, Aravind. You can't stay like this. You need a break. "O dear, please don't cry" "I am your guiding light. So, do not fall" "I shall take care of you like a mother" "I shall be the peace you're looking for" "I shall bear all your sorrows" "I shall love and take care of you, my moon" "O dear, please don't cry" "I am your guiding light. So, do not fall, my life" Aravind... your dad had visited my mom and spoke to her. He spoke about our marriage. But didn't expect all this would happen before that. "I'm here to talk and listen to you" "I am here you comfort you" "I'm here forever, to live this life with you and understand you" "Can't you see that my dear?" "I am your better part. I will light up your life" "The great love we share will make our world bright" "Millions moons may come and go but our nights remain" "The shinning stars will lit up our never-ending bond" "I shall bear all your sorrows" "I shall love and take care of you, my moon" "O dear, please don't cry" "I am your guiding light. So, do not fall" "I shall take care of you like a mother" "I shall be the peace you're looking for" "I shall bear all your sorrows" "I shall love and take care of you, my moon" Aravind... please take care of yourself. Don't step out alone. Look here, don't worry about anything and run your business well. If dad was alive... ...he'd have wished for the same. Right? Take care of mom. You also take care. Please come. You could've gone and spend few days with them. It'd have been a good change for you. What happened? I think I've some connection to my dad's murder. I'm missing something. I'm wondering what it could be. What do we do now? Keep driving. I'll tell you. It was here. I thought he kidnapped me because I roughed him up in his hood. But why would he kill my dad to get even with me? Aravind, phone's ringing. Hello, Aravind. Inspector Raghuram here. I was the one who initially handled your father's murder case. We came to meet you regarding that but your house is locked. And, I've found a clue in that case. Also all the document copies related to that case are with me. I need to meet you. So, please come to my house at once. I'll share the location. You wait here. I'll be back. Sir... Raghuram sir... Raghuram sir? Raghuram sir? Sir? Raghuram sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir? Raghuram sir? Raghuram sir, what happened? Who's that? Move! You were there when my dad got murdered. I know it very well. What's the connection between my dad and you guys? Why did you murder him? - Tell me or else... - What? You'll kill me? So what if you bashed up few of my men? Does that make you invincible? We must have finished you off along with your father! But for what? You're blind! That's why I spared your life. Now I realize it's a mistake. Your father believed that you will save him. You couldn't see how your dad was murdered, right? Let me tell you how I murdered your father! Save me. Save me, please. Please! Save me! - Sir... - Yes? Is the inspector in there? He stepped out for an important meeting. You can't meet him today. Sir, the earlier inspector, Mr. Raghuram... Yes, what about him? A genuine human being. Poor guy, wonder what was the issue yesterday. He committed suicide. - Suicide? It was a murder! - What? A murder? 'Did you witness it? Why did you go there?' 'How do you know?' You'll have to face the heat! Finally, you'll be framed for his death and the case will be closed. You don't need all this. I'm telling this for your own good. Don't blabber this to anyone else like you did to me. Leave, at once. Sir, you must do me a favour. Can you? This is the file that was handled last by inspector Raghuram. - Thank you, sir. - Don't be here for long. Leave at once. You had great words for him but now why don't you want him? 10 days before Deepika's wedding... a doctor was murdered in Besant Nagar. That murder was witnesses by that cab driver and my dad. Based on inputs from my dad and the cab driver... the had sketched out the murder's portrait. Some big shot must be involved in this. Who do you think, Aravind? Doctor, the doctor's murderer, the eye witnesses - my dad and the cab driver, inspector Raghuram who handled this case, Everybody has been murdered. According to the final investigation report... the doctor has no enemies or feud. Definitely then it's work related. Can I get the record of the Patient Case history that he handled recently? I'm unable to access that hospital's network from here. How about, if we connect to the hospital wi-fi? Then it's possible. Nothing serious. It's a minor concussion. You can discharge him after a good night's rest. Concussion she said? Must be a fake doctor. We have reached this far. How to go to the server room? How many will be there? Only one, it's the third shift. This gives me the concussion. -How can we get there? - He will tell you. I have set up everything. Corrupt the local network on my command. Disable all the CCTV. - Okay? - Okay. Let's go. Karna, corrupt the local network. Local network and the CCTV, both are corrupted. - Hello. - Hello sir.. The system become corrupt all of a sudden. Please come and check. Karna, disable the RFID of the server room. One second. RFID... done. The pen drive. What happened? - Connect. It shows Trojan loading. - Okay. Karna, the Trojan loading is complete. Yeah, one second. - Access accepted. - Yes. Karna, can you access the files? Yeah. What date range should I copy? Copy every case handled by that doctor. Okay. Copying. Aravind. The admin guy cleared the bug. Hurry. He is coming up the lift. What happened? He is on the floor. Aravind. He has reached the corridor Damn we are caught. He is here, he is going to open the door. We are done! Sir, one second please. Buddy. He is heading to the receptionist, quick. Oh is it? Okay. Okay thank you. I have analyzed the discharge summary of doctor Ravishankar as you asked. I have even verified that patient's record. The last operation he did was a 13 year old boy's surgery. The boy is fine now. The other three names are... builder Narayanan, Minister Aanamalaiyar and gangster Manal Rajan. Builder Narayanan is alive. He is clean. He has no criminal records. Manal Rajan? Records say that Manal Rajan had a natural death. But there are no details in Aanamalaiyar case history. Except for his pharmacy prescriptions. Minister Aanamalaiyar is dead. By elections recently happened in three constituencies, including his. Who contested in the opponent party? I guess it is M.M.P party Manimaaran. Aravind... What are you doing in my place? I forgot it's your area. Yes, I live here and why are you here? I came to inquire about Aanamalaiyar. So, why do you want to know about Aanamalaiyar? Aanamalaiyar is somehow connected with my dad's death. I need to know it. That will lead to the killer. What are you saying? These people worship him like Super Power. People here will beat you if you say that he is dead. Nothing happens here without his will. Anyone who goes to him for medical and educational help, he'd never refuse. Police can't touch even a soul here because this is under Aanamalaiyar's control. His wife and son were killed in a car accident few years ago. So looks like Aanamalaiyar has no foes. How's that possible? If there's an angel then definitely there'd be a devil to trouble the angel. "Beautiful roses bloomed in the pot" "Beautiful roses bloomed in the pot" "Flower pot brokens and rose life is gone" "Flower pot brokens and rose life is gone" Two cups of tea. - Jeevan will come here, right? - Definitely. Sudhan was his right hand. Messing with Sudhan is no less than messing with Jeevan. The whole scene will escalate once he's here. He will be here any moment. What he's gonna do? Let me see. What did you say? You will see? You and Sudhan... I did not chase to kill him. I was not eager to save him either. Boss! Look at him. Boss! Look at him. How did you let this happen? (Lamenting) Dude! Dude! He saw you! Brother. It is him. They have seen you. Let's get out of here, come on. Murder him. Who are you? Why are you asking about Aanamalaiyar? What business you have with Jeevan? There is some link between the death of Aanamalaiyar and my uncle. People here say that he died of illness. There is a mystery in his death. I am here to find it. My chief, Aanamalaiyar... he was like the native divine Ayyanar, who protected our fishermen people. He was friend who shared the happiness and grief in our lives. More than a friend, we saw him as our own family member. His word is our gospel. No one spoke against him. He started his life as a normal fisherman. And become the leader of fishermen union with the people's support. He soon became MLA and minister, and became an influential figure. With his growing political power, he also gained some enemies, naturally. Jeevan was a orphan. Aanamalaiyar adopted him and raised him like his own son. Jeevan was Aanamalaiyar's shadow. He grew up watching Aanamalaiyar's machoism. And he grew up with the same traits. He saw sir's enemies as his own enemies. He trusted Jeevan with all his responsibilities. He took control of the harbour. He took care of all the illegal activities possible, and help sir to carry out everything. He desired for people's influence, political power and fame, just like sir. He mercilessly killed anyone standing in his way. He even killed sir's wife and son and set it up like an accident. Jeevan knew that till my boss was alive he couldn't get his position Without my knowledge mixing slow poison to his regular tablets He made me kill my boss by my hands I don't want you to takeover my politics. Let this be buried with me. We must strive for the betterment of our area people. We must give the good education. Whatever the government cannot give, we must provide them. Push your allies into politics. And you take care of the people. Why explaining things to me? I will do whatever you direct me to do. He trusted Jeevan whole heartedly. I also trusted him completely. Only then I heard the truth from the doctor. I'm not coming out alive from here. You should take my place and look after everything. Irrespective of what you did to me, I hope you will do only good for the people. I want to ask you one thing before I die. And I will accept only 'no' as an answer. My wife and son... did you kill them? He made me to feed him slow poison without my knowledge. He killed him ever so slowly. Initially I thought that he was hungry for power and money. But later I understood... He was jealous of the enormous amount of respect the people had for him. He curbed his aggressive nature... and became a total politician. Dear... People are here to see you. Boss. He became the next Aanamalaiyar. People also accepted him as the next Aanamalaiyar. Long live our leader! Long live our leader! He murdered that doctor, who knew all the truth. He killed the cab driver and your dad to prevent them from becoming eyewitnesses. And now he's on the hunt to finish you off! We can't stay here for long. Come, let's go! Come, let's go. You leave. Take him away! Come on, guys! Buddy, they are here! Come, let's go! Come on! Guys, stop! I said, stop! Dear... Dear? Ain't I like a brother to you? Don't you like your brother succeeding? Weren't you telling our sir something, the other day? If I was made the district secretary... then I can gradually become MLA, minister and forward Now, how can you do this to me? Never expected your plight would turn like this. It's hurts me. Dude, careful! Come on, let's escape! Come on! Finish him off! Kasi? We will go this side - You go that side - Okay Come, let's go Come on Where did he go? I warned you repeatedly! It's all over! All over for us! All the local fellows saw me. By now Jeevan would've know everything about me. He will not rest until he finished us off, no matter where we hide. Oh no! There! My friends have started calling me from my locality. Put it on speaker. Kasi! Where are you? - Because of you I'm gonna die! - Damn it! Jeevan, this is Aravind here. Don't harm him. Aravind... I spared your life because I took sympathy on a blind fellow like you. But now you made me realize that it was a big mistake. You escaped this time. Let me see how long you and your family can hide and stay safe. You, then that fellow Kasi, your family... and everyone related to you... A brutal death is awaiting you all! It's over! Jeevan has targeted us. He'll definitely finish all of us! Aravind, how long do you think the escaping and hiding will work? Don't we have any other way out? We do!
