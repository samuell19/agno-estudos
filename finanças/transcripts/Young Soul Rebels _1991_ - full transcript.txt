So why are we stopping? I thought I might get a bit of air. Oh, likely story. I'll see myself home, then. You are bad. Party Time Hey, me can show you how to do a duck's arse. Look, man, I do the best duck's arse in Dalston. Mr Lloyd, can I turn it up? Ah, go on, man. - Have a look. - Yeah, man. You're not too bad at all. Blessed cheek! You see they kill a black boy in the park last night? - What did you say? - They kill a boy in the park last night. Man called James. Terry James. I know it ain't right. I keep thinking it could have been me, you know? How do you know it was round that bit of park? Why else would TJ be in the park, for fuck's sake? I didn't mean it like that, Caz. Christ, I knew him as well, you know. TJ, Chris. TJ. Yeah. TJ. Fuck. I ain't having it, Chris. It ain't real. Not TJ. The man says that the filth have been swarming round the estate this morning asking questions. You didn't see him? Not last night, there was hardly anyone there. I thought it was quiet. So you definitely not gonna come with us? It doesn't have to be today. I ain't stopping you. Caz, we've got to get some steady money in, mate. And I've got to get my mum off my back, do you know what I mean? Just send me your autograph when you sign up with Metro. Look, Caz, I can't stop living my life because he's dead, can I? Rest it, Chris. I'll see you later. Where you going? I'm gonna go down and see Roland about some crisp new tunes. You wait, I'll make tonight so damn funky even the white boys will shake a leg. Some hope. And I thought I was the dreamer. How you mean? Coming to Metro for employment. Telephone call for Mr Waring. Hi. Hello, can I help you? Hope so. I'm here to see Jeff. Jeff Kane. Soul Show. Is he expecting you? Yeah. He said to pass by. Me and him are good mates. Hi, Jill. Jeff Kane! Hi, Jeff. My name is Chris. Chris Morgan. I'm a big fan of your show, man. I wanted to talk to you about the station's plans cos me and my partner Caz would like... Thanks. Glad you like the show. It's good to meet listeners. I ain't just a listener. We're DJs. We run a club. But we'd like to get more into radio. Club DJs, radio DJs, not the same thing. Do you know how many listeners think they'd make DJs? Come on. But we're good. Anyway, you still play at clubs, don't you? Less now. A few weeks ago, I was booked at some goddamn club in Essex. They started giving me this 10% black-entry crap, otherwise their regulars are gonna cause some trouble. I told 'em to sit on it. But about us being on the radio... Send in a tape. Make it quality. Try Tony Colton first and keep hammerin' on his door. But I'll tell you something. An hour of soul a week is an hour too much for some. We got these patriotic listeners out there and they always ring. I thought your show was doing well. It's doing great, that's what they can't handle. But let me ask you something. Do you play your music for yourself, to party or for listeners? I didn't say at first, but me and my mate Caz, we don't just do a club, we run a station ourselves. - OK. OK. You're serious. - Tony's screaming for you upstairs. I gotta run. Send in that tape and keep complaining. Be down in 20 minutes if you wanna talk some more. Thanks. Yeah. Oh, God. God. I've seen you before. - Maunkberry's. - No, Global Village. Lacy's. Gulliver's maybe? Oh, that's... Or is it Saturday lunchtime down the 100? I've seen you somewhere, I know. So what are you doing down here? Apart from harassing Jeff and making security nervous. Most DJs run a mile when a fan turns up. Jeff's fighting to keep the Soul Show running and along comes you saying you want your own soul show. I think he was pretty polite, - really. - OK, cool, I'll split, yeah? Listen, how did you get to work - for him, anyhow? - Well, I don't. I wouldn't mind. I'm on the In Town Tonight show. PA to the producer. The In Town Tonight show? Hey, look, I tell you what's in town. Where those in the know go. Those who tune into Radio Soul - Patrol. - Soul Patrol. 107 FM. It's badly funky. I'll leave your name at the - door. - Ooh. Leave my name at the door? Yeah, sure. Well, what is it? Shame. Tracy, plus one. Watcha, baldy. All right, Trish? What're you doing round here? Police wouldn't let us play there. - Bloke got killed. - Yeah, I know. My brother is a soul boy and I am a soul girl. Will you show us the formation dance? I wanna show my mates but it's too hard, I can't - remember it. - All right, one dance, yeah? And that's it. Mum will kill me, letting you hang about here. Ready?

Listen, Trish, I'll see you back at the yard, yeah? Your dinner will be ready. Bye. See you. Straight home, all right? Hey, nice gaff you got here. - You got any whizz? - No, sir, we don't deal in chemicals. You heard about the murder in the park? Oh, look, it's Johnny Rotten. Give me a £3 draw. Easy now. Yo, Chris. Go easy on the draw, you know. Mind it don't lick out your head. Hold on a minute. Don't be in no haste. It's all, you mean? So go away, you boy. Any sign of Caz? I only see that brother of mine when he wants something. Soul Patrol. You hear that man? Soul Patrol! Take off that pretty boy music, man. Soul boy, you wanna tune into the roots, you no see? Boy, rest yourself. You're only into roots cos you can't dance. How you mean? Whoo! Watch it now. Ah, come on, you're - doing good. - Cheers. Ras, Babylon! What the bumbaclaat you doing? Hey! Oi, oi, leave the tunes. Hey! Who asked you to come in here? Whose premises? Mine. So what are you saying? Terrence James. Friend of yours, wasn't he? He's been murdered. We heard. So what you getting at? Anywhere near the park last night? - Dealing, were you? - Just what kind of fuckeries you talking about? Since he was supposed to be your mate, I thought you might have some ideas about it. Since when you interested in our ideas, eh? Eh? But as you say you is, why don't you check your skinhead friends then first? True. Since when Babylon cared in a black man murder? You said it, son. Let's go. Don't Let It Go To Your Head ♪ Now that you know ♪ How I feel about you... Hey, last place I thought I'd find you. Your mum let me in. Hey, the filth were round the garage today, you know? Making inquiries and generally kicking the place in. And your brother wants us out. Come to think of it, it's not safe anyway. Great. You got the - new tunes. - Yes. What time you on Metro, then? With you gone so long, I took it they'd given you a programme on the spot. It was a waste of time just like you said. I spoke to Jeff Kane, though. Great, you got the new Slave. Mm-hm. I made myself look a right wally, does that satisfy you? You actually met Jeff Kane? Yes, the man himself. Is that the new Benson? Yeah, yeah. What did he say? He said an hour a week of soul is an hour too much for some, for a starter. Lots of people go and see him. Not so many pirates, though, Tracy was saying... Hey, Donna Summer. The very latest. I had to fight half the gay disco DJs to get that one, you know. Who's Tracy? How come there's nothing on - this label? - That's a reject, innit? All the big labels are binning the records now. They can't get the black bands on telly, so they can't be bothered to promote 'em. As if they try. I know. Look, so what else have we? You got the new Parliament. What about the Philly stuff? Yeah, but I can't keep shelling out, can I, Chris? We'll have to get some advertising. We tried before. What we need is new listeners, a bigger radius. Yeah, better aerial. It's the only way. - I'll have a word with Ken. - Oh, yeah? How we gonna pay for that? Have to sell my body. Yeah, I can see you down the Dilly with your sex trousers. Is the Roy Ayers in the box? Yep, yep. Hello, Caz. Hello, Ann. So, how did you get on? Oh, forget it, Mum. Well, you went, didn't you? What did he apply for, Caz? Look, Mum, you don't exactly apply. Like I said, can you forget it, please? It's a joke trying in there, - ain't it, Caz? - Oh, yes? And it ain't a joke playing at bloody pirates? When are you gonna bring some respectable money into this house? I'm absolutely sick of it. Get off your backside and take Trish round to Caz's mom's. I don't want her out on her own. You out on the town again? Aren't you getting a bit past it? You cheeky bastard. Can't argue with that, can I? You ain't too big for a clip round the ear, you know, Chris. You got one of them funny cigarettes for me? Mums don't smoke weed. Oh, well, they smoke if they pay for it. And if you touch my catalogue money again... All right, Mum. All right, there you go. I'll run Trish over to Mum's for you. Thanks, Caz. I didn't say anything earlier. Well, what can you say? I am sorry about Terry. Friend of yours, wasn't he? Just knew him around. Not close. But thanks anyway, Ann. Is Trish ready? Yeah. Don't say nothing to her, will you? About the park. She knows somebody's dead, but I think that's all she knows. How are you supposed to explain it to a kid? Can't even explain the bastards to meself. I know. It's only a week since Shuresh's sister - got attacked. - Mum, I'm ready! Yeah, I know. Anyway, I gotta go home and get changed. I gotta get sexy for tonight. Oi, soulhead! Where's your boyfriend? Oops, children present. Where is your friend, then? Don't change, do you, Sparky? Always was a little slimebag at school. And now you're a bigger one. Oh, my feelings is really hurt now, Caz. Yeah? Well, be thankful it's only your feelings. What you been up to these days, Caz? Heard something about some poncy little radio station for all you little soul boys. Secret listener, Bigsy? You used to be into it, didn't ya? Oi, you wanna watch yourself, soulie. Otherwise you might find yourself getting arrested for one thing or the other. You got a minute, Ken? I wanted - a word. - Yeah. That mixer you got us... What about it? - It's duff. - Oh, you're joking. I'll have a look at it. If I can't fix it, I'll find you something else. Something better this time. Cheap. I ain't lining your pockets again, Ken. Specially if you're spending it on shirts like that. Sad. Forget the mixer. I'm after a better aerial. Bigger radius. An AH. Yeah, I'll see what I can do for you. You're getting thinner. Yeah. It's all the hard work. Yeah, I noticed. Eh! Off the metallic, eh? I wanna play with your aerial. Piss off. Watch the cloth, moth. Bit wound up, are we? What you need is a party, Chris. You coming to our little Jubilee get-together on Sunday? You could wear your white suit. And I'll wear mine. I thought that was your style, Sparky, my son. A big hood to hide your ugly face and slits for those nasty little eyes. Steady, Rocky. Give us a lug of that, man. Nice. Get out of here. You don't think they had anything to do with the murder, - do you? - Leave it out. Just the usual, winding us up. You can never tell with Bigsy's lot. But if he has had anything to do with it, I'll break his fucking neck. I didn't tell you, did I? I had a word with Ken about the AH. He's on the case. Oh Bondage Up Yours! Nice. This is Chris. And this is Caz. - Soul Patrol. - You like it, I Like It. Players' Association.

Oh. She's the one I was telling you about who works down at Metro. So, she's well out of your league. What you ask her down here for? Oi! Do I object to your friends coming down here? No, nice to be liberated, isn't it? Look, Caz, I didn't mean it like that. Hey, what are you saying? Rum and Coke, large. One Nation Under A Groove Shit, Ken, watch it with the drink. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. I thought I'd come and check out the club. Yeah. I spoke to Caz about the aerial - today. - No, yeah. Look, let me get you a drink. No, no, no, Ken, no. What, you're busy? Yeah, yeah. Listen, I'm getting 'em in. Do you want a drink? I've got one, thanks. All right. It's a bit mad in here. It's nice, though. Yeah, listen, Tracy, give me a shout before you leave, yeah? You're not going to join us? No. I'm getting one in for Caz. I'll see you after, yeah? What are you like? So what do you think of the Crypt, then, Jill? It's good. I've never been to a coloured... a black club before. Not to mention one with blokes kissing in it. It's only fashion, Jill. No. I'm only kidding. Do you know what, Trace, when you first started at Metro, I thought you was a snob, but we've had a good laugh. So, Tracy, hey, what are you hiding from, eh? A punk in red, white, and blue underpants. Oh, my God, you had his trousers off? No, they was on the back of his jacket. Oh, God, I can see when I'm not wanted. Oi, do you fancy? I don't know, I want to extend to the clubs. What's really happening. They've got no idea at Metro. The programme is dead. Yeah? Look, so what are you suggesting then? I'm suggesting that you make up a tape. Leave the introductions to me. Are you serious? I am sick of being a PA. I want to make some changes, Chris. You interested? Yeah, you bet. It's just the thought of TJ lying there. That boy could really dance. Don't think about it, girl, it don't do no good. Me And Baby Brother Now, that wasn't a hard night. Yeah, Soul Patrol. Soul Patrol. Yes! Yes! That was a cool night. Yes. Listen, Caz, I wanna make a tape up, somebody asked me. So what are you up to now, Chris? Nothing. Look, I just need a few of the records, yeah? Some of the imports. I'll get the last lot. Oi, see ya. Where did you get the motor, man? Look at that car, man. Nice car. Caz! Where are you going... Shit. What's with your friend? Need a lift? Yeah, thanks. Ah, Caz has got the hump. Can I put these in the boot? Sure. Ah, thanks. Yeah, this is a nice car. Thanks. So where's your mate Jill? Doing it with that punk. No. Yeah. So, where to? Tracy, can I trust you? What do you mean? Tell you in the car. I'll Play The Fool Hey. Well, there's not much to it, - is there? - What? Through here? Yeah. God, it reminds me... I used to listen to Caroline a lot. - What? - I even remember Radio 390, the R - That dates you. - Shut up! Missed. Fancy having a radio station at the back of a garage. Ah-ha! Tracy, uh... W-Would you like to... Are you going to... You could stay. You know, save you from driving back. What, here? No chance, you're joking. Hey. Hey, I've got work in the morning. And you're gonna make me a tape, remember? Yeah. Right, yeah. Pick your places, don't you? You heard what happened? Yeah, I heard. Oh. You like living dangerously. I just wanna show the bastards. I ain't stopping coming here. Brought this with me. Get 'em in the eyes if there's - any trouble. - Any good trouble... And you'll smell nice after. Not now. Not now. It feels a bit weird. It feels a bit weird. Yeah, yeah, whatever. It feels a bit weird. Give us your number. I mean it. I mean it. Your number. Write it here. Listen, I was there. He mugged him. His name is Chris Morgan. I think he lives on the Ladywell. No. I can't give my... No names. Right? No. No. Shit. Uncut funk. The bomb. Coming to you directly from the mothership. Top of the chop in every way. Five hundred thousand kilowatts of P-Funk. This song's dedicated to all you East London funkateers out there. Parliament. P-Funk. We funk. You've got the funk. P. FUNK Running Away Like it down here, do you? Come down here regular? Yeah. I ain't seen you before. So let go of me hand. I ain't into no rough stuff, right? Shit! Hey! Yo. Check this brother boot, no? Yeah. What we have here? Daggers? Hey, boy, mind you don't kick me with your daggers, you hear? Oh, no. Shit! - Socialist Worker. - Socialist Worker. So, disco sucks, does it? Mindless capitalist crap. And punk's not? Depends on how you use it, don't it? Should be something in here you could dance to. Oh, jumping up and down like my arse is on fire. No, no, no, we got reggae bands billed. Look. Misty in Roots. You'd like that. Oh, wow! Look. I'm in a rush. Ain't there more important things to talk about, for fuck's sake? Like this, for instance. Like two Somalis burned to death. Arson. Like flat doors kicked in, windows broke. Like Bengali school kids getting their faces kicked in. Join a picket about police - indifference. - All right. I'll place a few for you. But hear about that murder in the park? Same night I was running these off. Cock on the brain, you have. Did he get his pants off then? I can't remember. Ready for the verdict? It's pretty obvious, ain't it? I mean, the tape wasn't exactly professional. Stop worrying, Chris. Look, I told him you made up the tape last night. Anyway, it's only an impression he's after. I think I'm getting somewhere with this club idea. And can you keep quiet about your pirate credentials? - He's dead set against that. - So who's supposed to play our music then? You don't have to tell me. Come on, we'll be late. Hi, Dave. This is Chris Morgan. Take a pew, Chris. Yes, well... Nice choice of music. If a bit obscure. But you come over well. It's just that it's a bit, um... How shall I say, er... Casual? I mean, not everybody would understand what you're trying to convey. I like it. But the powers that be... Listen, Chris. To be honest with you, if we were to take you on as a presenter, out and about in the clubs... If we were, and that's a big "if"... ..we'd be looking for a more recognisable style. Something a bit more, um... English? Yes. Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that, but... How about this? I'm bringing a man called Fat Man singing... ♪ You can't keep we down, cos we all around ♪ Step forward, youth ♪ Come, let me tell you the truth ♪ That do you? There's clearly no point in our continuing this. I was merely offering professional advice, but it's obvious you're not interested. Tracy, I've got a programme to do. I'll speak to you later. You stupid arrogant fuck. I went out of my way to get you in here. Bang goes my idea. Shame, innit? The man just missed his chance of signing up a megastar. I can't believe this punk "no future" attitude. I ain't no punk! What you suggesting exactly? Was I supposed to play Elvis Presley records and sound like Tony Blackburn? They've got to realise that I'm your original, your wicked P-Funkadelic, wanna-get-people all-funked-up DJ. You've got no idea. Come on. Jeff Kane. One of the best, right? See this? His office. This is what he gets for his five years and the sack's full of fan mail. He's the only black DJ in the whole place, and still he's offered a contract he has to renew every three months. This is where they'd like to keep him. Keep all of us for that matter. Why do you stay if they insult you all the time? They're not gonna run me out that easy. Oi! Chris! That's the record you won't be hearing, for the time being at least. God Save The Queen was recorded just a few days ago, and 20,000 copies are said to have been pressed. But now A further association with the Sex Pistols, they've returned the master tapes to the group and no-one knows when or how... All right, son? OK. Oi! What are you doing? Come on. What sort of socks are those? What? I said... What sort of socks are those? What's that got to do with anything? The man wants to know about your socks. Listen, smart arse. No monkey business. You don't seem to realise, do you? You're not in here for showing disrespect to Her Majesty on Metropolitan Radio. No, nor for running your jungle bunny club on hallowed grounds neither. So what are you telling me? We know all about you, that's what. We've been watching you. Oh, and you might be interested to know we've heard of your tinpot little radio station. I'm not saying anything. I'm entitled to a phone call, right? You can tell Mum all the news later. But it's not the radio. And you're not in here for snatching some poor dear's handbag. You're in here for murder. Yo, sweetboy. Come over here and help me with this engine. I tired and the man coming for it tonight. You mad? I ain't going near the engine. You must want me to nasty up my garments. Yeah, pretty boy no wanna help nobody. If him can drive the motors, he should be prepared to dirty up him clothes, too. Man going like an African prince. Or should I say, "princess"? Piss off, Davis. Can I take it out for a spin, then talk prices? Yeah, Ken, no problem. What do you reckon, then? Is it worth it? Well, there's nothing wrong with it. You have a word with Davis about the price and I'll help you out with that gimmick you're after. Better be worth my while, Ken. Easy now, Ken. She faster than a bumba. You take notice, soulhead. Number one salesman round these parts. Why? You sell it? Good as done. You no see me have the deadly patter? Deadly. Yeah, boy. Are you gonna tell us? Where were you the night before last? Easy. I was with me mate making up tapes. Look. I want my phone call. Not impressed. "With me mate"? And do you think that'll hold? Suppose I tell you that you were seen, you and your mate, by the park that night? Drives a Triumph, right? So what? Look, it's the truth I'm telling you. I want my phone call. You ain't got nothing on me, right? Seen it before? No. No? Your kid sister has. She was seen with it in the park, before you burned it, that is. Panicked, did you? Tried to burn your dirty black paw marks off it, did you? You bastard! Bastard! What are you doing getting at a nine-year-old kid? You're calling me a bastard? You'd kill to get your filthy mugging hands on a bit of plastic. Kill one of your own. I say one of your own, not that you'd see it that way, you being a half-breed, a mongrel. I want my phone call! My phone call! My phone call! My phone call! You went back to find it. Whatever your sister said, she stuck up for you. So just who is involving kids in this? Give the coon his call. Caz. Caz. Caz. Hello, can I speak to Tracy, please? No, no, no, I don't know her surname, but she works on the In Town Tonight show. Look, look, it's urgent. Please. Just use the fucking Tannoy. Yeah, Davis. I like the motor. It's just a question of the right price. Sane. Did you have a word? I got you that present. It should do you nicely. Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it, Ken. Trusting, aren't you? Hey, Carlton. Yeah? Them say them looking for a half-caste boy now for that murder. Can't trust them half-caste boy. You don't know which side them on. Could well believe it was one of them kill that black boy. No, man, that's what them want you to think. So when the people say, "We heard about the murder," Babylon can say, "Is black kill black." I don't see it. Well, as far as I and I concerned, must be a white boy. And if it wasn't a white boy, I'll lay on money it was half-caste. Nah, I reckon it's an NF job, meself. I'll see you later. Are you serious? You trying to wind me up again? Yeah, it's true. Most probably it was a white boy that killed TJ. But it could have been a black man. So what are you saying? It can't happen? What exactly you getting at with all this half-caste crap? Caz, the trouble with you, all right, can't always tell what side you're on. Hey, now what you saying? What? Cos Chris is my mate, or cos I mix with white people? Man. White man. Nastiness. So, that's what it's about, yeah? I mix with white men? I fuck with white men? - Jesus. - Long as you doing it to them. Innit, Caz? Mind the rod of correction gonna fuck up... You're full of shit, Davis. That brother that got killed in the park, he was what you call an anti-man, a batty boy. That make it all right now? You concerned about who did it now? Thanks a lot, man. You've been nothing but trouble, Chris. You screw up at Metro, then have the nerve to drag me down here. Bastards. What was I supposed to tell 'em? "Oh, I was pirate broadcasting at the time, and my best mate hangs about in parks after dark"? Chris, are you listening to me? Tracy, I'm sorry. All right? Thanks for getting the solicitor for us. Listen, I've got this tape, right? It was in the beat box. You've gotta give it in, Chris. What? Go back in there? No, you're joking. Look, I'm no friend of the police. But if it's evidence, don't mess with it. Oh, so I just let them drag my little sister in for some friendly questioning, eh? Yeah, yeah, all right. Forget it. It's none of my business. Just keep me out of it. I've gotta get back to work. You look pathetic. Come on. I'll drop you off. Come on. Cute, aren't you? So you wanna get to know me? What's your name? Name? You a policeman or what? Just being friendly. Tell us your name. Man, you're one stubborn white boy... Chris. Yeah? I brought you something. It's out the front. Give us a hand, it's a bit heavy. I'll be right with you, Mr Stylie. Easy goes. Careful, careful. Rock Creek Park Twice as many Soul Patrollers. Never enough for you, though, is it? Won't rest till you're on Radio 1. This is the BBC Soul Service. Are you sitting comfortably? What really fucks me in all this is they were questioning my sister. A nine-year-old girl! It's like they're going wild. Do you know what I mean? It's pure slackness, man. I'll keep guard, yeah? Yeah. Kelly was in there. What is it, let's-get-the-half-caste week or something? You were nearly a goner, man! Right. Let's waste no more time up here, man. Let's just do the thing and get down. You were nearly a goner, you - know. - Oh, thanks, man. Oh, yeah. Tracy fixed up a meeting with this producer down Metro. It was her that got me out of - the nick. - Are you serious? You've been crawling round Metro again? Look, Caz, I've gotta get some steady... Steady money in! I got us the fucking aerial! You think I like doing Ken favours? Dragging my brother into it? Carlton's gonna let a car go cheap for me and you, you know. Look, Metro weren't interested, so just forget it. Look, Chris, I'm just saying, all right? We are getting through. There's an audience building. We'll get advertising and have the money! Look, you were trying your way. I was trying mine. Same thing! I wanted a partner, not your - fucking vanity. - Look, Caz, I am your partner. Tomorrow, we're gonna hit the airwaves, yeah? Funk the Jubilee special. I can't tomorrow. I said I'd play a concert with that punk I met, Billibud. Don't joke about it, Caz. I promised. I might as well smash it down then, mightn't I? Cos Caz can't be bothered. He'd sooner go off with Billibud to play for middle-class punks and hippies. Wankers, Caz! Where's your loyalty, man, eh? Where's the fucking loyalty in that? Where's the loyalty in you going behind my back? Strutting round Metro, prattling about what we're doing? Ain't you got no sense? A quick word with the Home Office, and they can have a station like ours wiped out before breakfast. I thought I was supposed to be your main man. Hey! What you talking about? You are my main man! I've had a day of it, right? And a bit of sympathy might be in order! Yeah, cry on Tracy's shoulder! - I'm gonna smash that thing! - Yeah, smash it! You might as well! Caz! I ain't begun to tell you about what happened down the nick! I ain't got time! I'm gonna go and see Billi! Caz! You see this tape, Caz? It's TJ's tape. Lovely dress, darling. Bomb the rich!
