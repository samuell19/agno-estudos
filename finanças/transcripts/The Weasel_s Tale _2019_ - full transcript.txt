Mara Ordaz in DUNES OF PASSION SANTA GAUCHA There's no better lesson than pain and suffering. LOVE SHOT WOMEN OF THE HOMELAND THE OTHER WOMAN... FOREVER Best actress in a leading role Mara Ordaz, "Santa Gaucha" I'm sick of those gunshots. Mara, look ! I brought you a pet ! I wrote that line for you in "Muddy Blood," 1962. Thanks for the tribute. "The evil gaucho loomed closer and you, and you, the sweet girl with the youthful braids begged for mercy." "No, no ! Where do you come from ? Where are you going ?" "What do you want from me ?" "From dust I came, to dust I shall return." "And what I want..." "Well, it's obvious, isn't it ?" "You're mine !" Fuck, shit, dammit ! Too wordy, Marita, too wordy. Why use three words when one will do ? I could give you fifty more ! Loser, has-been, corny, screenwriter ! You shit turd ! Now, that's called a "pleonasm." Vulgarly known as "redundancy." What else could a turd be made of... Shut up ! Anyway... Scene two from "Satanic Harvest." Argentina Sonofilm, 1959. Not my best film, but it had its moments. Why don't you both leave this house ? I never wanted you to live here ! I hate you both so much ! I hate you ! Too on the nose for my taste. All her years as a movie star and she never learned to hide exposition. It looks like you love tormenting her. Looks like ? We should be careful with Mara, she looks weaker every day. What if something happens to her ? Look, if oblivion didn't killed her, what could a poor little rat do ? On the contrary, she loves it ! She screams to exercise her inner puppet, her tool, whatever it is that passes for the soul of an actor. Just like you wrote. What was that line in "A Cry in the Night" ? "A man grows stronger from having a little of many weaknesses." "A little... angina, a little smallpox, a little sadness and a little fear." It wasn't "a little angina." I wrote "a little pertussis." She said "a little angina" and you let her say it ! She was right. Nobody knows what pertussis is. God forbid they should learn something. The only bad thing about this house is the vermin. They're not vermin, Martin, they're little critters. Weasels, hens, rats. Critters. Some eat what we have, others get eaten by us, because we're critters, too. One critter eats another, which eats another, and so on... And, one meal at a time, you have the history of the world. How philosophical of you. We're flying at high levels of depth. Guys ! Over here ! I'm not sure if I got it, but I tried to capture the essence of the landscape. As years go by, the life and colors of this field still stimulate me. It's an endless source of inspiration... It's rude for me to say it, but I think it's one of my best pieces. Yes, it is. It is rude. It's the land, but with a soul. The sky, but with feeling. In all, it's the landscape, but with my stamp. What a huge piece of... stamp. It wasn't that good a joke. No, but he's so funny ! And you're so easy ! Well, here's the thing: the stamp is there, but the landscape... What can I say ? He laughs, what can I do ? Was it me or did I hear Mara scream before ? Oh, yes. She saw a critter, poor thing... She's been a bit sensitive lately. Well, I think I'll have to assume my role as a husband and stand up for her. No, you already played too many roles in your life. - And all badly, right, director ? - Oh, here we go again ! One day you'll have the guts to tell me what you really think of me as an actor. Pedro... Someone who can pretend to love Mara for 50 years is... the best actor in history ! You're mean ! How mean, he's terrible ! Okay, okay. Homemade almond tea with three drops of honey for you... Thank you. A dash of port for me and with more sugar than Cuba for Pedro. - Come on ! - One more, please. - Thanks. - That's it. - Cheers ! - Cheers ! I don't mean to be fussy, but... What should we toast to? What to toast to... A toast to our life not being like one of your scripts. - You mean, not perfect. - No, because it is ! In movies there are no lives like ours, without problems. A beautiful, solid friendship, over 50 years without any conflict is too boring, right ? In a movie, there should be... danger, a threat... a villain. Who comes along just when everything seems fine. Exactly ! So I toast to our lives not being like in the movies. Cheers, cheers ! Excuse me, good morning. Sorry for the intrusion. We need help. - We don't have any. - It'll only take a second. I'll just be a second. We need to be in Buenos Aires by 2:30 and we're completely lost. We have an important meeting, we can't just not show up without calling and we have no coverage. Can we use your phone ? Don't show any desperation, they might charge you for the call. They're in a hurry, Mara, no need for you to come out. Why not ? They can't go away thinking everyone in this house is rude, and ugly too, my God. Sorry, sorry... Mara Ordaz ? No ! No way ! My goddess, please ! Oh, so there's still such a thing as elegance ! I need to get out more. It's an honor to meet you. Delighted. I know you too. - Martin Zarabia ? - No. That's him. Just a screenwriter. I'm a huge fan of your movies ! Well, this will sound like an old line, but... they don't make them like they used to, do they ? Yes, you're right. That is an old line, try coming up with a fresh one. It isn't easy at first, but everything gets better with time. Not everything, look at you. You see why I love you ? So you must be Pedro De Cordova ? Yes, thank you. Your husband, right ? Did you work in the movies too ? No, no, no, I'm an awful actor, I can't write, I hate hauling lights, sewing costumes, applying make-up, painting sets... No. I can't even make coffee. I have no skills. - He's a director. - Norberto Imbert, pleased to meet you. I can't believe it, the whole team is here ! Sorry, Francisco Gourmand, and this is Bárbara Otamendi. I can't believe it, four hyper-super mega-geniuses, total GODS ! Oh, don't exaggerate ! Four ? Come in, the place is a mess. Oh God, God, God ! - It's no big deal. - Is this the... People are always so impressed, but to us it's just a trinket. It's true that only two actresses in history got it for a foreign film. Me and Sophia Loren. What can I say ? Merely a statue. Cold, stiff... Sofía Loren, I mean. Why did she age like that ? She looks so deteriorated ! - Am I wrong ? - Always. - The telephone is over there. - Thank you. Sorry, may I ? Okay. Wow, it's so heavy ! Like all the men in this house. You can't imagine how many times I watched the ceremony... Old, faded tapes... I remember every word you said. "I'd like to thank all my cast and crew, "people without fame..." "or glory..." "...and who, if it weren't for me, would be out of work." You were more generous than Mara. What she really said was "who would starve to death." Martin won't forgive me for being so excited that I forgot to rave about his marvelous script. All set ! Meeting canceled. Okay. What's this ? Such strength ! Like... the artist was a trapped soul, but filled with passion. No, he painted it. Pedro. You painted this ? Well ! For the same man to be this actor and this painter is just too much ! - You should exhibit these ! - No, no, no. - I don't like people to see them. - And vice-versa, darling. Anyway, since we're here, how about a tour ? Of course ! I'd love to ! Come on. Please, take Pedro downstairs. We had a small elevator built for my husband after his... Oh, right, the accident. No, you guys go ahead. I'll stay here. Go on. My sanctuary in this mausoleum. You can't imagine how happy I feel down here. Come in. If my mother saw this she'd die all over again ! She loved you. - She showed me all your movies. - What a darling ! Give her my thanks. She passed away. Oh, then give her my condolences. Come, I'll show you a film by Demare that you won't believe. He used to ask me for my advice. It's unbelievable that such a great director wanted my input. Incredible, no ? Take a look at this bed ! It's fantastic ! I'm quite an expert on antique furniture. So I'd say it's... Elizabethan ? It's a prop, Francisco. "The Revenge of Lucrezia Borgia," right ? Oh, you saw it ! - A real gem, right ? - Yes. A sort of "boutique" epic. Low budget, poor directing, script ? What script ? A great performance, and nothing more. We called it "Mara's Revenge." That bed alone cost $15,000. You deserve it. I'd created a charming Lucrezia, full of life... ...and these guys turned her into a murderer, a total bitch. Lucrezia Borgia was a bitch ! And you were perfect in it ! If only you hadn't made us cut her death scene... My audience didn't want to see me dead. Everybody wanted to see you dead, Mara. Especially the crew. You cut it because you didn't have the guts to do it ! - What ? - Of course. The three hardest things for an actor are: laughing, crying, and dying. You cut the scene because you couldn't do it. How ridiculous ! How could you even say that ? You know that I'm the epitome of emotion ! Fush, fush ! Let's go ! I always dreamed of running down these huge stairs ! No, please ! Don't ! Please, these stairs are dangerous. They're very slippery. Most accidents happen at home. Let's see how a goddess descends to the mortals. You look stunning coming down the stairs. Better than going up. Pedro ! I really can't decide if you're a better actor or painter. I'm serious ! - Want to see my studio ? - No, Pedrito. - This tour has taken too long. - Almost a whole act. No, I'd love to ! - I'll take you. - Thank you. Let's go. How long have you been painting, Pedro ? When I was young I studied fine arts. Then I got into theater, and well... Now I've gone back to my first love. Look at all this vegetation, Mara ! And that tree, how old is it ? Sweetie, in this house we don't ask anyone's age. I'd like to see it up close, would you join me ? - All right. - Come with me. Don't tell me you're also a sculptor ! Only in the shower. And you work with molds ? How odd ! Your art looks so free. I wouldn't have thought you worked with molds. No, that was for the statue in the garden. It was a rush job, that's why. This tree reminds me of you. Because time goes by and, I don't know, it grows... stronger, and more beautiful. Really. I can't imagine a man who sees you and doesn't... surrender at your feet. Oh, darling. Let's be realistic. Not everyone has your good taste. Well, thank you. Have you ever... thought of acting again ? Every minute... of every hour of every day. And why don't you ? Now, if you do, you have to do it all the way. You have to start going to premieres, living the night scene... Yes ! You have to live in the city... You have to move ! Here... Here, this is too far away. And with P... What do I do with all this ? - With this house ? - Yes. Well, yeah, it won't be easy. It's from another time. It must be inefficient, expensive to maintain... But don't worry, I work in this business, I have... We have a real estate family business, so we can help you there. For me it would be an honor. It's Mara Ordaz' house ! I really never thought about it. Everything will go fine with the house. My worry is that the world can enjoy you again. That's what worries me. Here's what we'll do. I'll leave you my card. And those holes ? Looks like not just the humor is acid around here. Wow, this is amazing ! So this is where it all goes down ? - What "goes down" ? - Nothing goes down here. No, no, I mean, is this your creative space ? "The day will come when my legs won't stand the weight of your love." - That's yours, right ? - Yes, it is. In high school I conquered my great love Patito Ruiz by reciting... - "The light of your face..." - Wait. Why don't you let a real actor say it ? - Pedro ? - No, no, no... Yes, my love. Say it, yes ! Well, he doesn't want to. You go ahead. Yeah. "The day will come when my legs won't stand the weight of your love." "The light of your face too dim for my eyes to see, and the music of your voice, too faint for my ears." "That day..." "That day..." "That day will be too sad for my life to bear and that day my death will come." "And if you reject me, that day will be tomorrow." Well ? What do you think ? I think Patito was an easy lay. No. No, no, no. It was your words, Martin. No, my words are nothing. Without a great director to shape them and a great actor to give them life, they're ink stains on a piece of paper, a wilted salad of meaningless words. No, no, I'm shocked ! I've never heard you admit that before ! - I'd never seen this guy act before. - This... I hope we see each other soon. What did he say ? That, contrary to what some believe, people still remember me. Fush, fush, fush ! They're nice. They're nosy. They're bad. Turn off that crap. I have an announcement to make. I can't take it anymore. I can't stand your dialogues, your monologues, or your asides. Actually I can't stand your voices in any shape or combination. I can't stand your silences either. To sum up, I can't stand you. I'm selling the house. Pedro, if you like, you can come with me. You two... can go fuck yourselves. End of the announcement. You see why I love you ? You're not going to sell the house. END of the announcement. Don't mind her. - This is... - Fucked up. Well, technically it's a conflict, but colloquially... It's fucked up. Thank you for letting me drive this gem ! A '63 Triumph ! You don't know how much I love these relics ! Excuse me. You are. - I am. - No ! No way, what an honor ! You were in "Lightning in the Mist," right ? - It was all me. - Please, what a joy ! - I can't believe it. - But tonight... she's all mine. - No, it's my treat. - Really ? Really. Your smile is enough. - Thank you. - Go ahead. Dining out with Mara Ordaz. I hope this restaurant was a good choice. - Is it expensive ? - Highway robbery. Good choice. Good evening. I'm sorry, but there's an hour w... Oh, sorry. Mara Ordaz !? I still am, knock on wood. I'm dying ! Oh, I'm such a fan ! No... "Santa gaucha" ! Yes ! To the max ! - To the max ? - To the max ! Max ? Who's Max ? Oh, no, I'm shaking, sorry. Please, don't leave. I'll be right back. - Please. - Thanks. I've been missing out for not going out more. Please, come. Sorry, I'm so excited I don't know where to begin. - What would you like to drink ? - Just water. And wine, of course. - Two glasses ? - A bottle. We have a great wine. Pulenta, 2005. "Polenta" ? - Pulenta is little pricey... - Bring it on. - Okay. Excuse me. - Thank you. Things are coming along just fine. Everyone at the office is working, looking for your new place, and the hard part, finding buyers for yours. But for that, I need you to sign - ...this authorization. - What is that ? It's a document where you authorize me to sell your house. I need it because you won't believe what's happening. Every time I say I have Mara Ordaz' house for sale, they don't believe me. "What ? Mara's house is for sale ? You're kidding." That's why I need your authorization. I not only authorize you, I demand you to sell it ! You must be sick of these fancy restaurants, right ? No, I'm sick of the other ones. You never get sick of fancy, it suits me well. Here. Pedro was different. He was always more discreet. Imagine we'd come into a place and everyone would mob me, touching me, touching my dress. He had to literally pick me up in his arms and carry me into the kitchen. You should have seen him then. He was so strong, so splendid. People love you, don't they ? - They loved me. - No, why do you say that ? The past is a prelude to the future. I think you mean prologue. - Right. - Sorry. No, no. I'm surrounded by Martin and... Martín... What a guy, huh ? Sorry to say it, but from what I saw, he won't stop tormenting you. And Norberto ? Who does he think he is ? He thinks he's better than everyone, that he knows everything. I saw they were making fun of me. They were making fun of me, and it's okay, I don't care. What worries me is them making fun of you. You sacrificed yourself for people who hate you when the world loves you ! They even turned Pedro against me. Sometimes I feel like... an old fool. Mara, you're anything but an old fool. You're a vibrant woman, admirable. A beautiful woman. - I told you that you have good taste. - Yes. Okay, here's a bottle of pure heaven. - Who'll taste it ? - The gentleman. - Where's the toilette ? - At the back on the right. - How was I ? Good ? - Perfect. Great, you're a very good actress. I've been studying for ten years. Five with Julio Chavez, four with Nora Moseinco, now I'm in a musical comedy workshop in Proscenio... The kid outside was great too. - Is he in your class ? - Yeah, but he's just starting out. Another level. - He's inexperienced. - Right. He's not as good as you. - You're going to be a big star. - Well, thanks. So, was she ever really famous ? I really don't know. I just want to make her feel good about herself. She's not coping well with age. What a shame. Our profession is so tough. All professions are tough. That's why they're for professionals. The wine. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - Don't I have a say ? - Why ? It's my house, paid for with my money, earned with my success. Norberto and Martin had a lot to do with your success. And they made a lot of money for it ! Fortunes they squandered who knows where ! And they made me a prisoner in my own house. - You invited them, Mara ! - No. I invited my best friend and my sister. And they brought their husbands. When they died, why did those two stay here ? I think they earned it. Didn't they take care of you when you needed it ? What the hell are you shooting at ? Weasels ! For now. Go to bed, mummy ! You should be in your sarcophagus at this hour ! Fossil, dinosaur ! What can you do against a weasel ? Weasels are young, vital ! Looks like that one was mortal. Two in the morning and he's hunting, four in the afternoon he's hunting, three o'clock and he's hunting. He thinks he's Attila, that old scumbag. I can't wait to get rid of him ! Just you and me, Pedro, as it should have always been. You don't need me. I do ! I don't want to die alone. I wouldn't know how to live alone. Let's sell the house and move to Buenos Aires. I'd love to have another crack at it. At what ? At everything. What about them ? We'll give them some money if you want, so they can have something. Until they get settled. What are you looking for ? Those are nothing but old reviews. Oh, look ! Here's one that mentions you. - Let's see. - Look. - Let me see. - Here's your name. "Pedro De Córdova, Mara Ordaz' husband in real life, is adequate in his small role as the eunuch." What you did with your voice was wonderful. "But it's Umar Ghassan who shines in the role of the Sultan of Muhammara with his imposing and sensual presence." You can't still be jealous of a rumor. I told you a thousand times that was just a publicity stunt. I never found him the least bit... I don't know... Oh, look ! Look, look ! Here it is. It's the deed to the house. Zabala, Maria Graciela and Palumbo Pedro Francisco - What is it ? - Nothing. It's all smudged. A lifetime has gone by. She left me ten messages all through the night, I had to turn off my phone. Why ? Did she get cold feet ? No, I think she liked me and can't stop thinking about me. Yeah, is that your target ? Giselle, Ms. Otamendi the notary will be working in my office. Even if I'm away. No, I'm multi-target. I'm a mass-market product. - Yeah, I know. - I'll tell you later. Seriously, what did she want ? - Are you jealous ? - Oh, yeah. I don't know if I can compete. Competition is good, you'll have to outdo yourself. I can't believe I found you. Francisco, your dad wants to see you right now. Oh, patience. Call the old lady today, we need that deed ASAP. Sure. Fran ? Don't tell your dad about this, okay ? This is our project. Okay ? - Hello ? - Look who's here ! Geniuses ! Don't overdo it, kid, you're already in. Indoors with this sunshine ? Indoors because of this sunshine. We're night owls. What it must have been like back then ! Can you imagine the sixties ? Now everything's changed, a whole different ball game. - Can I give you a tip ? - Excuse me ? - Advice. - Advice. - Can I give you some advice ? - No, thanks. - We already have plenty. - You need some sun. You're very pale, you need sun. Sunlight has vitamin D, it's good for your skin, for your bones. The sun... is like life. True. And night is like death. And death... is an endless night. I like night. And I like death. Just kidding. Welcome ! So nice to see you again so soon ! - We got stuck. - Did you try turpentine ? I'm glad you came because, the truth is, we feel at a disadvantage. You at a disadvantage ? - Yes, of course. - I don't think so. Yes, because you know all about us, but we... know nothing about you. - There isn't much to know. - Yes, there is. - There's a lot to talk about. - Shall we play a game ? What ? No, no. I've never even held a cue stick. Francisco ! Is that you ? - Yes, Mara. - Oh, I'm so glad you made it, darling. Come downstairs to the screening room ! Excuse me, come with me ? - No, you go. - Okay. I'll stay here with the fellas. - I'll go with you. - No, Pedro, stay. Don't leave me alone with these two, they scare me. No, why ? - Will you teach me how to play ? - You break. How long have you lived here ? Mara and I, forty glorious years. Forty years ? - That's more than my whole life ! - It could be, darling, it could be. Why did you add Pedro's name to the deed ? I don't know, it was just after the accident. I wanted to show him my love. But I never told him. So you did it to show him your love... but never told him ? You're starting to sound like Martin, my God ! Can't we just erase it ? No, this is notarized, we can't do that. He doesn't want to sell ? It's those two Rasputins, they've dominated him completely ! I swear ! No. Well, you're a woman of infinite charm. I'm sure you can... come up with something. Oh, we shall try. The beauty of this deal is that it's quite simple. It's like a game where everyone wins. No, no, no, no. I don't know any game where everyone wins. Well... That depends on how you play. Thanks. - Wow, well done ! - I fooled you, huh ? I love fooling people ! You pocketed two stripes and this one's an easy shot ! - I saw it. - You've already won ! Oh, don't be so negative. - She won. - I'm stripes. A game is only fun when there's a winner and a loser. In this game you two win. But where will we go ? Oh, we won't leave you homeless. We have many contacts with Planned Retirement Facilities. We'll help you relocate. Planned Ret... what is that ? A home. If I may... Let me clean the pocket for you. Thank you very much. I hate the word "home," it makes it sound so old. And old things get thrown away. Please, don't get bogged down by resentment. Bogged down ? No, resentment is my best motivation. Some of my best friends are resentful. Besides, you'd be together, with other people like you. She won. You... lost. Oh, yeah ? I have one left and yours are all on the table. Yes, but to win you have to pocket the 8 ball. - Go for it. - Give me another. I need to taste something more than triumph. You know what your problem is ? You like easy shots. And nothing good is easy. - How so ? - Sure. When you saw an easy shot, you went for it. - I helped you see it. - I saw it myself. All right, you saw it yourself... but then I pointed this one out. You saw it was easy and went for it I dusted the table, easy shot, you went for it. You should have broken that cluster, but you looked where I wanted you to. And I was watching you the whole time. And what did you see ? A young, extraordinary player... Superior, I'd say. That's what's extraordinary about young people. Superiority. And you "old people" can teach us how to live, right ? Oh, no. Only barely how to win this game. To win this game, you have to watch your rival, think like your rival, feel like your rival. It's not easy. That's why I like playing bad people. It takes one to know one. Very nice ! Careful... Very nice ! Another one ! And, when it looks like there's no other option, you can always find a way. Moral of the story: Don't just watch the game, watch your rival. Your rival might be more dangerous than he looks. Your rival might appear easy, and attack when you least expect it. Are you going to say "boo" now ? No, no. That won't scare you, it takes something stronger... Weasel ! Sorry, Martin, go on. - I'm not afraid of you. - No, of course not. You're afraid of being beaten. And I beat you. Thank you for the game, not so much for the moral. Morals are passé, in films and in real life. Nowadays winning is what counts. A happy ending, and move on. You're a good player. They might have a table at the home. She's beautiful. She's arrogant. She's bad. Oh, mon amour, mon amour, mon amour. I think it's going to rain. I hear thunder. No, Pedro. It's my heart beating like thunder. I was struck by lightning for years, with a clouded soul. But now I see the sun rising in your eyes, and suddenly, I'm warm... and humid... Forecast: passion, with a chance of lust. You shouldn't eat so much at night, Mara. No, Pedro. The day is ours, let's enjoy it. Just the two of us. Alone. Okay ? Why don't we play a game ? You mean besides this seduction game because you're after something ? Please, Pedro, stop with the sarcasm. It gives you ugly wrinkles on your face. Yuck ! Let's pretend, we're actors. Let's close our eyes. Let's get hypnotized. Feel the breeze and pretend we're in Paris, on our second honeymoon, walking along the Rive Gauche. The wind brings beautiful music, a Parisian accordion... Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour. From the boulangerie comes... a delicious aroma. Weasels ! Will you stop hunting ? We're getting hypnotized here ! Let's pretend the Nazis are coming. It hurts me that those two stole you away from me. Two lonely, frustrated old men who just gave up. They didn't give up, Mara. They fought. When others went into exile, they stayed here. - And we hid them in this house. - Yes. They could have gone to Europe, to Spain... had great careers, be someone. Like their wives used to say. Over and over and over again. Let's leave, Pedro. Please, you and I. Francisco can get a million dollars for the house. We can go to Europe. Maybe even find a specialist for you. Let's go back to what we were, please. No one ever touched me like you did. Why did you stop ? You cursed, gorgeous, sexy, green-eyed dragon, I'd eat you up. You're right Mara. I was a fool, we've wasted so much time. Now, can you tell me what you want ? Now we're talking. Let's see, champ ! Check. Son of a bitch. This game is torture, I'm sick of it. It's just brains ! It has no emotion, it needs wine, night... Here they come ! Hey, guys. - Hello, hello. - Hi, how are you ? Listen to this. Apparently now they can reproduce a person's image perfectly with a computer. They'll finally make movies without actors. Promises, promises. - How would you like your juice ? - With lots of sugar, honey. All right, my love. Oh, and bring some cookies for the boys. Yes, my love. - What's going on ? - Nothing. Pedro, we just saw it with our own eyes. She was being nice. We don't have that much imagination. Let's see... What tool does an actor use for a job ? - Sex. - No, they already got the part. - Pedro... - Motivation ! What does the character want. I just found out that forty years ago Mara added my name as co-owner to the deed of this house. Why ? To show me her love after the accident. After all, it was partly her fault. If she added you to the deed to show her love, why didn't she tell you ? Because she's Mara. It was enough to show it to herself. Well, that's huge news. Because if you don't sign, she can't sell. Everything stays the same, I'll order a dozen rats right now. Is there a problem ? I don't know what this character's motivation is. Do you remember when I asked you to let me play the sultan ? Both of you said no, I wasn't romantic enough. Umar Ghassan was romantic, little Pedro wasn't. You said so. Both of you. So... Pedrito... We're all born to play a role in life. Mara was born so that Lucrezia Borgia wouldn't die. Martín was born to bring life to "Gertrude, the Goose on the Loose." Me, to tell other people what to do. And you... You were born to not be an actor. You can't play someone else, you're no good at lying. Mara can act like nobility, you... are noble. Ghassan could fake love with a thousand women. You gave your heart away only once in your life... and it was real. You're the most passionate person I've ever known. The problem is... you can't act it. If you'll excuse me, Mara's making me some juice. We could have her committed. Plenty of people would be willing to testify. They're all dead, Martin. They'd rise from their graves to put her away. No, we can't do that. Pedro loves her. You remember how that feels. - Vaguely. - Well, not him. - To him it's very present. - I don't get what he sees in her. It's not what he sees, Pedro isn't a camera. The problem is the other two. - Vermin ! - Nah, critters. They're all little critters. Speaking of which... Let's see, Romulus ! Come on. There we go, eat up those little critters. There you go. Yummy ! There he goes. Look ! It looks like he's dancing ! Look ! Now this is an insect ! Do you realize ? Look ! This is an insect, not like... Not like that Barbara and the other one. One critter eats another critter. I hate it when it's too easy. - Good morning. - Good morning. Mara is expecting you. That's not dirt, it's a mole. I loved that mole. Were you two very in love ? The mole and I were, but he didn't show it much. Of course, this is Pedro's version. Stella wasn't so... like that. At first we loved each other a lot, yes, Stella and I. Later on... I don't know. If movies, which are made of plastic, fade... imagine love, which is made of good intentions. One day she left and we never heard from her again. I'm very sorry. Thank you, it's just life. Yes, but... It must be hard when a loved one suddenly vanishes. It wasn't easy. You're studying your rival. Good for you. Yes, I wanted to apologize, the other day... Hello ! Did you come alone ? Yes, Francisco had a meeting he couldn't miss, but he told me to say he's always thinking about you. Oh, he's so sweet. We have such great rapport. I found a great place for you and Pedro. - No ! - Yes. Downtown, great location, great people... I'd snatch it myself if I could afford it. Tell me everything ! Norberto, would you go to the kitchen and make us tea ? No. Would you go to the kitchen and shoot yourself ? No. Would you shoot yourself anywhere ? I'd rather make you some tea. I knew I'd convince you. Check. Tell me everything. When can I see the apartment ? Anytime ! Did you convince Pedro ? I'm working on it. All the sweet-talking is making me sick. The other two worry me. - Don't you find them strange ? - No, they're twisted... Bizarre, perverse... But in show-biz that's normal. Tell me about the place. Does Francisco like it ? He has such good taste ! I have this feeling like something happened with their wives. Why do you want to know ? Just to get to know each other better. Didn't they get along ? No one got along in this house. There was a lot of frustration. They were incredibly talented but the 70's were a nightmare for them. Why did Martin have to go and make a documentary about peasants in the harvest ? What did the peasants do for him ? Nothing, ever. Straight to the black list. Was Norberto black listed too ? No. He retired in solidarity with his friend. When democracy returned, their time had passed. Everybody turned their backs on them. Martin ended up creating "Gertrude, the Goose on the Loose." - No ! He created Gertrude ? - Yes ! He worked here, in hiding. Let's talk about the new place. Do you think our furniture will fit ? Yes, of course. Well, some of it. How did your sister die Elvira... suffered brain damage... eight years ago. I was on location with another brain damaged person who called himself a director. What a masterpiece he made. "The Girl Who Cried Bitch." It was supposed to be a horror film, but it turned out horrible. Where were we ? Oh, yes ! The apartment. - Your sister's death. - I don't want to talk about that. - Why ? - Because I don't want to ! I'm sorry. The thing is... We're about to do something very nice together... She was obsessed with cleanliness, she cleaned all day long. Floors, windows, but her true obsession... was this. She carried it around everywhere like it was her baby. She'd show it to Martin and say "Look, this could have been yours." "You deprived me of this. You and those stupid peasants." - And what happened ? - She slipped. She fell down the stairs, came tumbling down, hit the podium... and the baby flew into the air and landed on her head. She died instantly. A strange accident. Not really. Look how heavy it is. When do we sign ? No wonder Stella left. She didn't get along with Norberto. And after Elvira's death, it was unbearable. She took to drinking, she'd yell at him all the time, she almost went mad. And finally, one night, she left. She vanished and left me alone with them. She never even called me. Like it was my fault. I don't want to talk about this. Sorry, um... You said you were on location. You weren't here when she died. No. They told me about it. Enough, let's talk about the future. Yes. You're right. Have you got the papers ? Yes. They're upstairs, I have them. Your tea. Don't mind me, carry on. I'm sure they're fine, I'll bring them right down. An auditor came one time and he was a huge fan of mine so they never bothered us again. Check. Is the property bigger than 25 acres ? - May I see the blueprints ? - Let's see... It's stuck. Everything gets stuck in this house. You, the tube... - Everything. - Here. This is not it. No. That's all there is. It has to be one of these. But... These are notices from the Federal Tax Bureau. - You never answered them ? - I never read them. Just imagine, with all the letters I get from fans who adore me, who would give their lives for me. I didn't answer them, poor souls. I didn't read them. You owe taxes for seven years. - Can't we pay after selling ? - No. You can't sell a property that you owe money on. This... Between fines and interest, this could cost you thousands. And where do I get "thousands" from ? How many thousands are "thousands" ? We live off our pensions, our savings, what we grow here... We don't have any money. I should have read some of the letters. I remember one from someone who wanted to produce a film of mine. He was a huge fan. Anyway, I don't know if it would be good to read some now. It won't be easy to settle this debt if we don't have any money left. They never said anything, I never read anything either. I might just not be made for this world. It's not like it used to be. Can't you borrow from someone ? - Can't you borrow ? - No. I don't have anyone left. You don't have any jewelry, something you can sell ? No, we already sold everything. I do have a bracelet. Very valuable. It's the only jewelry I never wanted to sell. - Good ! Will it be enough ? - Much more than that. Do you remember the movie "The Sultan from Muhammara" ? Oh, yes ! Umar Ghassan, right ? - Yes. - My God, he was gorgeous ! He gave it to me. Yes. It'll cover everything. I'll find it. - Perfect. - I'll find it. No rush. We still need a few days to sort out paperwork. Check. You found Romulus. I wonder how he got in the tube ? Serendipity ? What should I do with you ? Where is it ? Where the hell is it ? Thieves ! Always overacting... - We've got to do something. - Yes. Who's the thief ? Turn that off ! Come on, spit it out ! The over-the-hill writer, the handic... The crummy hack, who was it ? Who was the thief ? Besides your mind, did you lose something ? I haven't lost anything, you stole it ! The sultan's bracelet, don't play dumb ! The one that Umar Ghassan gave you ? Wasn't that a trinket ? It wasn't a trinket, it was a gift of love ! - What ? - Never mind, it's worth a fortune. - Where the fuck is it ? - Darling, mind your language. There are kids in the room. Now that you asked a clear question, I can give you a clear answer. Elvira took it with her. Don't joke about that. Elvira loved that bracelet. She wanted to be buried with it. That's stupid. I said that at the time. But you said it was a trinket ! We have to sell it, we have bills to pay ! - We don't have it. - We need to get it back ! But it was a trinket ! Listen, your heart is weak. You wouldn't like to see your little sister's remains all rotten, decomposed, smelly, full of worms... You already look a little pale. We have to get it back. We have to get it back ! You would do that for a gift from that moron ? I would do anything ! Watch me. So it wasn't a trinket. No, it sounded like a gift of love. I heard "gift of love," didn't you ? Yes, she said it clearly. "Gift of love." Anyway... It's been ages, better to forget, sell the house, let them start over... Yes, sometimes it's better to play dumb. Totally. The sultan part was the role of my life. And you two chose to give it to that guy. Next time you try to manipulate me, remember that without that decision everything would be different. My career, Mara, my life, our lives... Everything. Give us a hand ? Ah, look. Lightning at exactly the right moment. Put that in a movie and no one will buy it. Let's go. So it was a gift of love. He was a sultan, I was a eunuch. I didn't stand a chance. Shut up Pedro, please. You'd rather me be silent and blurry like that film, right ? What a great actress you were. You faked passion so well. You played it perfectly. Especially when the director said "Cut" and you went on kissing. What a funny gag ! Cut ! Guys, cut ! You laughed so hard, Mara ! And I just stood there, laughing like an idiot, pretending I didn't care. I even looked amused. And they said I was a bad actor. What a eunuch ! And the press interviews... Boring, right ? But you were a professional. If you had to be there, you went. And so did I. Just like any other fan. You prepared so well for each role. "Emotion, Pedro. Emotion is what matters most, you have to give in to emotion." "You have to bathe yourself in emotion." Your emotion was so believable. So real. How could I not believe you ? So I was more successful than you, so what ? I still loved you. Why couldn't you hold back your jealousy ? Because I played a eunuch, I wasn't one ! What did you want me to do ? Keep quiet ? While you had a blast in front of everyone ! It's not about you. This is my job. Look out, Pedro ! We never laughed together again. And the way you used to laugh, my love. Everyone loved you for that bright, glowing laughter. And I, your number one fan, loved you more than anyone, more than I loved myself. We were so young, Mara. We had plenty of room for love, but not anymore. Life filled us up and there's no more room for anything. What do you want ? The truth. I cheated on you. Forty years ago I cheated on you. And I've ruined your life ever since. And for forty years I've suffered for it every day of my life. Happy ? Could you... say you're sorry ? What for ? What's done, is done. And nobody says "I'm sorry" in this house. The whims of time. To think that these frail phalanges once looked like... a bunch of sausages. - Where are you going ? - To the Tax Bureau. To see how I settle this. Fush, fush, fush. Mara, don't act like that. I acted as I wanted when you were the director, imagine now. Look what we got you. - Can we make peace ? - You thieves ! We can't make peace. - Give it to me. - No, don't touch it. - You've never heard of "cadaverine" ? - What ? Grave poison, produced by the corpse's decay. It needs to be disinfected. Apart from a strong stench of urine, "putrescine," "bacterial vaginosis"... What do you say ? - You're repulsive ! - You're welcome. Start packing your bags. I'm off to see Francisco. - Give it to me. - You're not selling the house. - I'm not ? - I'm not signing. - Is this your revenge ? - No, not revenge... It's, for better or worse, it's the life we built. This, for bad or worse, is a sentence. I wish you had killed us both. I'd rather be dead than live like this. I wrote Gertrude the Goose based on you. Open up. - Asshole. - Piss off. She'd rather be dead. It feels too claustrophobic in here. We need to change location. - Why can't I come with you ? - I can handle her better. - Oh, right, Mr. Heartbreaker... - I can't help it. - What can I do ? - Yeah, right. With this we pay off the taxes and we're all set. I can't believe she's giving you the bracelet. It's so... powerful. Powerful ? Wonder Woman's bracelet ? You didn't see the sultan movie. - Come on, not again ! - Watch the movie ! - I think you like this bracelet... - Who wouldn't ? If you behave yourself, I'll see what I can do. - Good morning. - Good morning. I just bumped into Barbara Otamendi, she said to wait in her office. It's Mr. Gourmand Jr.'s office. Yes, of course, but they work together. Yes... well, yes. Sign, name, company, and time of entry. Of course. Mario Soffici. - Son of a... - From the offices of Soffici... Del Carril and Tinayre. Yes. Barbara went to lunch, please take a seat. Would you mind if I wait in her office ? You see, I'm a little... not young. - Third floor. - Thank you. Wow ! No, don't touch it yet ! Better not to paw something so beautiful. The man who gave you this must have worshiped you. It was a passing obsession. But I can understand his adoration. How romantic. Anyway, will it be enough ? What a pity when passion is lost in a couple, isn't it ? Bárbara, Mr. Soffici is waiting for you. Who ? Soffici, from Soffici, Del Carril & Tinayre. What are you doing here ? Excuse the fake name, I always wanted to be Soffici. You don't know him ? - What do you want ? - You don't know him. - What do you want ? - To chat. And it's sad... And it's sad to finally realize that the person you loved is not that person anymore. Dreadful. I mean... Why stay with someone who doesn't love you ? It's sad that he doesn't appreciate all you've done for him. Now that I think of it, divorce might be best for everyone. Because neither of you is happy now, or are you ? I hope the powder room is where I left it. I came all this way because I wanted to see you in your natural habitat. I expected something smaller for a family business. - It's a big family. - Which you don't belong to. You had so much authority... I thought you were Francisco's boss. But it was the other way around. I'm a notary, and I freelance. I'm not an employee here. Don't worry, with your skills... as a notary, you'll soon be the owner. We're swamped with work, what can I do for you ? Sure, I see how busy you are. Because you don't sell houses. You're... What do they call it nowadays ? Developers ? - We develop complexes, yes. - That's it ! Things were simpler before. Now everything is... complex. I'll tell you what I'd do with Mara's land. Tear the house down and develop... a complex. Because our movie is over. We have to strike down the set. That would be pragmatic, yes. And when it comes to pragmatism, you know... a lot. I was browsing through your bookshelves... The entire collection of "How to Help Yourself by Fucking Over Everyone Else." And this caught my eye, Mara's films ! Some directed by yours truly. The best, by far. You did research on us. The work of a true craftsman. I have a lot of respect for good craftsmen. That's my favorite: "Love at Lunchtime." It was so sweet. Nah, too bland. Witty, funny ! But no. Martin had to save the world with his documentary and ended up doing "Gertrude the Goose." - At least he tried to save it. - From whom ? The world is great. It works, it's organized, logical, it's not even complicated... It has just one rule: the stronger one wins. The world warns you, it's very sportsmanlike. You're the only person who's ever stood up to me. You're strong. Another cliche ? Which one ? The spider woman, the black widow... Blame it on Martin. He made me look at my rival and once I started I couldn't stop looking. Besides, it's good if we're on the same side. The contract will be signed. It might as well be on good terms. From one craftsman to another. Please, don't toy with me. I'm not. No. - No. - Why ? Because for you it's just an infatuation. And I'm looking for something for the rest of my life. Then let's get to work. You look lovely, Mrs... Mardaz. Gorgeous ! Yes, I'm wearing a dress from my first film. - Oh, that's why ! - You do remember it. Well ? I'm bad with names, but... How did it go ? Let's see... "The Girl Who Cried..." "A Lot" ? No. - "Who Cried..." - No. "The Girl Who Cried"... - "Out Loud" ? "A lot" ? - You don't remember. Yes, yes, it was great. That was my trade mark. Dancing and dying. Like the death scene in "Lucrezia Borgia," remember ? I cried. The whole movie. It's amazing. And the love scenes with Alfredo Alcon in... "Gertrudis, the Goose... on the Loose." In fact, my friend and I think those are the best scenes in our history. How dare you try to act in front of me ? You worthless bit part ! Small time, vaudeville extra ! - Get lost or I'll kill you myself ! - Okay, I'm sorry... But... Today I went looking for Elvira's death certificate. They don't have it anywhere. I looked at City Hall, the Capital, the Province... It's nowhere. What a hard worker, you went everywhere. Online, Norberto. Yes, to the State, Elvira never died. I found it suspicious and thought your ex-wife would know something. I looked her up and her last known address is Mara's house. I was going to track her down, but then I remembered the corroded holes in the bathtub... and I said no... I'm not going to find her. See why I say you're strong ? Elvira, Stella... The end justifies the means. Now that's a moral I can buy. - She figured it out... - Didn't you see the movie ? You fucking son of a bitch ! What did you want ? - Who do you think I am ? - Ma'am ! - You get out of here ! - No. - You dumb ass ! - Calm down. With all the leading men I had, what were you thinking ? You don't have the stuff to be a gigolo, you little shit ! - Don't make a scene... - Get away ! Mara, Mara... The pathetic old fool is one part I'll never play. Let alone with you ! I wanted to make it easier... No, please. Mara, Mara... Please, don't leave. Stay here. Forget the house. Forget everything. No, no, no. You signed a contract, remember ? - You can't force me to sell. - No. No, but you signed... an agreement to cover all expenses incurred in looking for buyers. And it's a fortune, Mara. I can also sue you for lost profit and malice. A lot of money. Money you don't have. That was a copy. If you want to let off some more steam, here's another. Tear it up. Now let's talk about Mara. I don't want anything to happen to Mara. I don't want her to slip, fall, trip or tumble. I don't want any heart attacks or strokes, pneumonia or whooping cough. No headaches, toothaches, diarrhea or the flu. She gets so much as heartburn and I call the cops. And don't even think of hurting me. With the evidence I have, you'll go straight to jail. You will beg to go to a home. Stop, stop, please. Breathe. Relax. Sit down. "Breathe" he says... There you go. I don't want to go to court. I'm sure we'll come to an agreement. Why are you doing this to us ? What did we do to you ? No, no, nothing. No, no, this is strictly business. Why are you so upset ? Because I put myself first ? You do too. You've been putting yourself first your whole life. Get Pedro to sign... Don't over think it, it's a done deal. If you can convince him, great, if you divorce him, great too. Do as you please. Why... ? Why... ? I've never met anybody like you. In movies, maybe. But in real life... never. We do better in real life. That's why I got into movies. I'm sorry. After everything we did for you ? What did you do for me ? Do you want to hear what I did for you today ? I don't mean the movies, forty years ago, or saving your life eight years ago. I mean today, today ! Today I was about to humiliate myself in front of that... villain... to beg her, please, on my knees if I had to, to let us die in peace. But I couldn't, luckily, I couldn't, because once again, once again, I had to cover for you for the death of the girls. - Well, "girls"... - Shut up. That story we fabricated... We've told it so many times that we began to believe it. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know !? Come back to reality, Mara ! Wake up ! The way you repeated that ceremony over and over and over again in front of the only audience you had left. Sometimes Stella presented the award, and Elvira clapped... Other times Elvira presented and Stella did the clapping... And sometimes no one presented so they both could clap. But that time was... special, huh ? It was thrilling ! You won't believe what happened to me ! But we were the ones who hid the bodies. Us. So that the press wouldn't find out, so there would be no scandal, so that nothing would happen to you. So that nothing would happen to you ! And look how you paid us back. We've lost... everything. Everything. She's cold. She's an actress. And she's good. But this is not a movie, gentlemen. This ends here. The four protagonists defeated, the bad guys win, the music doesn't swell... A shitty ending. Like in real life. And a slow fade to black. Hold on. I think there's time for one more act. "And my stuff ?" No, softer, softer. "And my stuff ?" No, neither. "To storage ? To storage !" BEING A HOLLYWOOD STAR DIDN'T CHANGE MY LIFE My work, my career, my life, my blood, my art... my art... all sent to storage ! BETWEEN CINEMA AND LOVE Signature... How clumsy of me ! Forgive me. FACING A TURNING POINT IN HER CAREER They're coming ! - Are you ready ? - To storage ? To storage ! The tea hasn't cooled down yet. They're early. Put it in the freezer. - Not enough electricity. - Serve it anyway. - It tastes different. - Who cares ? I do, taste is everything ! Taste is effect, detail. Taste is God. I can act the coldness. Coldness is all you can act. This is no time to be rude. - We are always talking... - Quiet ! - I'm ready. - I'm not ready ! The almonds need to be at room temperature to keep their bitterness. I have absolute confidence in you. Bitterness is your specialty. - You see why I love you ? - Please, don't fight. If we're going to do this, let's do it with style. - Okay. - Merde ! Good luck. - Good day. - Good morning ! You look happy. Yes, looking happy is what I do best. Truly beautiful. You're wearing my bracelet ! How nice ! Yes, I paid for it ! With my fee as a notary for this operation. I just love it. I love all it means and I thought it would be the perfect occasion to wear it. Such good taste. - You see ? She doesn't mind. - Oh, no, on the contrary. I can really use it. Shall we ? Action ! - Welcome ! - Hello. How lovely, the kids arrived ! I'm glad you're in a good mood ! What a beautiful bracelet for a beautiful lady. It smells funny, doesn't it ? The smell of the classics, you'll get used to it. Still chasing weasels ? You don't chase weasels, weasels come to you. Please, come inside. Well, here's ours. - You don't have a lawyer ? - No, no, no. - You don't want any witnesses ? - No, no, no, no, no. No need. I understand how you must feel. Forty years living here ! Of course you're comfortable, but... it's also been forty years away from the world, right ? Now you can go back, make new friends. - Do you have many friends ? - Of course. Do you see them often ? Well, we all work too hard but we go out for drinks once in a while. I'm in touch with two friends from high school. How lovely ! - Where's the money ? - I mean friends. Who care about what happens to you, who would sacrifice themselves for you. Oh, those tangents, Norberto ! It's all right. I understand. No, I don't have time for friends. That's the problem nowadays, no one has time for friends. We do. Pedro and I will take care of you. A kind of compensation. Please, don't let this destroy your friendship. This property is way too big for the four of you. There are too many people in the world. At least two too many. Here comes the tea. It's not cold because there's not enough electricity. But it's not hot because we have no gas, so... What are you going to do with the land ? Who cares ? This house is full of sad memories. - Where do I sign, dear ? - Here. I can't believe you don't care. This is our home. One second. Martin, I want to make clear that this is not an age thing, all right ? There's no... youthful arrogance here... I'm well aware that some day I'll be old too. Don't be so sure. Like my friend Yusam the magician used to say: Shit happens. You were friends with Yusam ? Very close, I called him "Yu." Sorry, before signing... Maybe we should see some money first ? - Yes. - Don't take it badly. No, no, no. It's so ridiculous that you can't sell a property with a check. As agreed. 200,000 dollars now, 20%... The rest when you vacate the premises. - Would you like to count it ? - No, we trust you. - Completely. - No, please. Sign first and then you have your tea. - Good, we're both anxious ! - I want to be done with it. We'll be leaving the house right away. We don't have a lot of stuff, and they've already packed. What about my things ? To storage, Pedro. What do you mean to storage ? To storage ? My things, my life, my blood, my art ? My whole life sent to storage ! A career sent to storage ! No, let's celebrate. Have a cookie. - What the heck, a cheat day ! - Okay. Shall we continue signing the contract ? Signature and clearance. - There we go. - No. Careful ! - How clumsy of me ! - Don't worry ! Forgive me. Don't worry about it, I have many copies. Oh, okay. It's adorable how older people become like children again... It's just an accident, Pedro. As long as you sign. - That's all. - Yes... there you go. - All set. - All set. A toast ! - Cheers ! - To life ! - Cheers ! - Cheers, my love. Will you look at the time ! It's five twenty-three. Darkness is upon us. - Are you going somewhere ? - No, no. Not us. Have another glass. Yes, it's delicious ! I bet you could sell this recipe to a coffee chain. No, I don't think so. I know top people at Starbucks. - I can put you in touch. - No. This isn't for companies. You have to grind the almonds by hand. It takes a craftsman. Almonds ? Bitter almonds. Tic, toc. Tic, toc. Aren't you three having any ? Clumsy hands. Stomach ulcer. Survival instinct. This sounds like a funeral. What does life have to do with almond tea ? A lot. Can someone die by the thorn of a rose ? Of course not. What about tetanus ? Isadora Duncan wore long, beautiful scarfs. One day, her scarf got caught in the wheel of her convertible... Ciao, Isadora Duncan. The most innocent things can kill you. For instance... bitter almonds are inoffensive, but... cyanide... has the same taste. Life, death, it all depends... on who mixes the ingredients. Tic, toc, tic, toc. Pedro, What have you done to me ? - What do you mean ? - What has he done to you ? Oh, you're not thinking that... Please. Besides, it's very easy to tell cyanide and almonds apart. Because cyanide and its variants produce seconds after ingesting a sensation of asphyxia... Pedro, what did you do to me ? Come on, don't be childish ! What is this ? A school play ? Are you going to bring another spider now ? No. I can't breathe. - What do you mean you can't breathe ? - No. - They tricked us ! - What is this ? - They betrayed us ! - Enough. Let's cut. I won't play anymore. We agreed to leave Mara out of this. But you saw her drink ! But you said the poison was in their glasses ! - What's going on ? - Stop fucking around ! I told you I have enough evidence to put you in jail ! We're over 75. We get house arrest. Pedro... No, Mara. We said her glass would be clean, what did you do ? - Whatever it takes. - My love ! - Pedro ! - What did you do ? Not this... - I want to live with you, Pedro. - Yes, my love, me too. We wasted so much time... I don't want to die now. No, my love... No, don't worry. This is not what we rehearsed. I can't live without you. - You didn't know ? - No. Mara ! I won't let this happen ! Give me the antidote, now ! I won't let this happen ! If she dies, I go with her ! - No, no ! - Give it to me ! I can't live without her ! I don't want to die now. Not now. - Water ! - Mara ! - Water ! - What have you done ? - Mara ! - Water ! - What is this ? - Whatever it takes. Darling ! My love. - Pedro. - What, my dear ? - Stay with me. - Yes. - I love you, you know that, don't you ? - Yes. - I love you too, Mara. - You know that, right ? Yes. I lied about Umar Ghassan. I was angry. I never cheated on you. - It doesn't matter. - Yes. Yes, it does. I only wanted to hurt you. Hold me, my love. Mara, my love. My love... - And how are you two holding up ? - You old bastards ! Is that what you do ? Anyone bothers you, you take them out ! No, no, not anyone. Not anyone. Weasels, only weasels. Son of a bitch ! The tea was poisoned ? Do you think Starbucks will still be interested ? A Grande Morto ? I'm going to sue your ass off ! I'll take everything ! No, not a trial. A bad agreement is better than a fair trial. Every poison has an antidote. And every contract can be broken. Sons of bitches ! Murderers ! Don't get excited, the poison will circulate faster. Take a tip from us. Stella ! All right, there. Here it is. Now what ? Wait... if we give them the antidote, they'll go to the police. No, we won't go to the police. No, no. You're right, they could... Stupid me, I didn't think of that. They'll go to the police, we have to let them die. No, wait. We'll confess to killing Mara, okay ? So you feel safe. I'll just sign this and you can fill it in later. I'm not signing a blank page. Okay, I signed ! If he doesn't want to, fuck him ! Okay, I'll sign ! Good, Martin. Give them the antidote. You had it. Oh, right, I had it. But where did I put it ? I'm lucky my head is stuck to me, otherwise... Where did I put it ? Here's an idea: let's play hide-and-seek. - You find it. - What ? It's a small dark vial, about this size. - The chicken coop. - No, cold, cold. - The barn ? - Cold. Please, Norberto, please. Where is it ? Where is it ? Please. I'll do anything you want. Freezing. I know. I know. You sick fucks. How could it be there with our wives ? - Now, that's a little offensive. - Then where is it ? I know. Cold, cold, cold. We wouldn't harm such a prestigious award ! Maybe... another little statue... Though... not so little. Sons of bitches ! Old bastards ! You think you're the only ones who are dangerous. Give it to me. - Come on, hurry up ! - I can't ! What did you do ? You used the wrong vial. - What ? - I told you to use the large one. - That's only one dose ! - What do I know about doses ? I said "Norberto, use the large vial. The small one is just one dose." - Don't you remember ? - Not at all. You birdbrain ! Now what do we do ? - We do nothing. - But it's only enough for one ! Let them negotiate, who cares. Give it to me ! Give it to me ! - Let go ! - No ! Please, kids. Don't fight ! Give me the vial ! You got me into this ! Why don't you share it ? Give it to me ! Get back ! Looks like the femme fatale is not that fatale. Give it to me ! Give me the vial ! - Fuck ! - Drop it. - Give me the vial, Fran ! - What are you doing ? Give it to me ! What did you do ? What did you do ? You think you can get away with this ? You're going to rot in jail, you old bastards ! You've lost everything ! Everything... Even your freedom. I'm going to call the poli... Wh- what... ? What is this ? What you drank inside was really almond tea. Well, slightly enhanced. Just an emetic. Antimony Tartrate. My mother used it for indigestion. I had a very rough childhood. The poison was in the vial. It was his idea. The brilliant touch... Martin's, not mine... was that there wasn't enough poison to kill you if you had shared. You see, for me, a story without a moral... Sorry, honey. This is mine. How shocking ! Too cinema verité. Look, princess. If it's any comfort, he would have done the same to you. So few men are willing to die for love. You said the poison was in the tea and just for the two of them. You didn't trust my acting. It wasn't very believable. What do you mean ? I was very believable ! Miss, wasn't I... ? Well, she bought it. Don't listen to them, Pedro. Without you, I wouldn't have been so great. This was for those who say that Mara Ordaz can't handle a death scene. It was the best death scene I've ever seen ! You were better than her, and she's dying for real. Next time I don't want any of that pototium pentotate. I don't need it, I can act the vomit. - No one can act a vomit. - What do you mean ? I did ten of your scripts. Chapeau. A round of applause for the goddess. - Oh, thank you. - My goddess. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. - Bravo ! - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bravo ! Thank you. My love ! Does my king desire anything else ? For God's sake, I don't deserve so much. You deserve... everything. My green-eyed dragon. My gorgeous, my sexy ! Who almost gave his life for me ! They didn't need to lie to me. - I could have acted it... - Yes, of course. I've known many actors, but no one quite like you. Yes, Mara, but what you said in the screening room... Let go, Pedro. Let go. I love you so, so much. So much. What is that ? The bed banging against the wall. Tell me it's haunted or I'd never believe it. This turned out to be a romantic comedy after all. With the money we can send them to Europe. The French love old people having sex. We should be careful with that money, it's unreported income. We should go into money laundering, drug trafficking, smuggling, politics... A gruesome and risky world. Well, we love risk. And gruesome is even better. Let's think. We have all the time in the world. THE END THE WEASELS' TALE
