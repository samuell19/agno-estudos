girls I know what you and he made he's right don't you well I don't know I mean it's probably very exciting and all but and it's not quite normal you must admit that what do you think it is it makes them the way that they are maybe they have husbands who are always off in Arizona playing board games Denise sometimes your humor shocks me sometimes it shocks me too they are so oblivious to everything else except each other and it's really fantastic I've never seen anything like that in my entire life I have in college there were a few girls like that they weren't as obvious of course you could tell they had a thing for each other you imagine can you see Evelyn Sarah carrying on like that Oh Deniz I think I would die laughing you know idea this might sound funny to you but I don't

crazy place where all the wild people go but the strangest thing was this couple sitting in the corner holding hands and cooing that's not so strange lots of people do that to girls I will always put you off but never on what they told me hands in front of everyone mm-hmm and they were very pretty mateys weren't they Denise yes they were at the player card oh sorry uh what was everyone staring at him no all I the waiter and us did he ask them to leave no as a matter of fact he seemed to approve wholeheartedly why even Denise didn't seem to think they were so strange well they look quite happy

streets I mean how would you like it if some queer seduced your kid I think that would be rather difficult to do kids aren't as naive as we were they know all about sex by the time they're 10

around loose kids may be on the ball but they're so damn easy let it straight you just don't know what goes on and can't test anymore Oh Denise you all sneak I think you're gonna do it come on Vera get your cannon gear do you think that girls are lesbians from the time that they're little oh no I think they get that way from things that happen to them what's wrong a manic-depressive isn't born that way mental illness is something that happens in my psychology courses in college the professors were very hesitant to call it mental illness some of them agreed that it was a preference made through environmental incidents that occur in early life well you can't say that it's normal normal is a terribly overused word meaning average the average man goes to work from 9:00 to 5:00 but some don't that doesn't mean they're sick well I think the whole business is sick mine don't make yourself comfortable but don't fall asleep on me I won't Hager wake up the movies over you fell asleep the

to you about I think that I'm in love with him oh I wish you could know and do I do you'd like him he's so fun to be with he likes to do everything and he is so talented just to be with him is such an adventure where does that leave us Denise you know that I'll always love you and you're the best friend I'll ever have but this this is different I've never known anyone like him and I want to be true to him you mean an exclusive relationship I know you'll understand it's just it that he worries about us having an affair and I wanted to know that he hasn't got anything to worry about I want him to feel secure and my love for it does he know about us no nobody suspects and that's why we can't go on the way we have been I'll always love you and we can still be good friends it's just that we can't have anything physical between us not anymore I'd feel too guilty going to him and I don't want that to stand in our way does he love you as much as you think yes how do you know I knew this is all very hard for you to accept but I know that he loves me Denise we've even talked about getting married what I'm gonna stay with David long enough to get sweet and then when he gets a series that he's been working for and I'll be with Jim all the time only right now he needs my help in right now I am glad to give it to him maybe he's just playing with you for the help I expected that you would probably say something like that you'd like to think that's what's happening in East but it's not the way it is try to understand this is different he is not like other men he really cares about me sure he wants his career and he wants to get ahead but that's not everything he wants a home in a family hi come on here I didn't think you'd be home but since other than the name of it I thought I'd
