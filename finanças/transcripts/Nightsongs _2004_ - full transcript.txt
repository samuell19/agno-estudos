I can't stand it anymore. No, I can't. We can't live like this anymore. You lie there and read. You don't go out. You don't do anything. We have no money, you have no job, we have nothing. You used to do the shopping or go to the post office. You neverwanted to go out. I used to love going out. Before I met you, I was always out and about somewhere. Every weekend. And not only that... I had friends. Maybe not so many, but I had friends... girlfriends. But they don't stop by anymore. Not even Marte. She just rings the bell and says, "I'll wait for you downstairs." 'Cause all you do is spread bad vibes. The last time my girlfriends were here, you just sat there, just like that, and didn't say a word. It's awful! No, it's unbearable. That's why they stopped coming. No one comes to see us. You're really sick. Yes... No, I can't take it much longer. Then someone finally visits us, and who? Your parents. Your parents visited us, too. Not long ago. And I didn't ask them to come. - But they're coming. Not for long, luckily. It's no wonder they want to see their grandson, is it? Shouldn't they be allowed to? They're coming to see their grandchild. You understand, don't you? That's the only reason they're coming. It's about time they came. They should have come long ago. As if they didn't care about him. I'm serious. They don't want to be a burden. Then let them come. Alright, I get it. Then I'll have to clean up, hmm? It should be nice and tidy for Mrs. Mother-in-law. No, stay there. Please. Don't get up! I can't stand it when you run around. I'll clean up, you just stay there! Go ahead and read your book. Or could you do the shopping? Or do I have to do that, too? I have to shop, clean, cook for your parents... No, you can do the shopping! - Yes. - What? You're going out? You don't even have the guts go to the mailbox. So why did you say yes? What should I say? - No, just stay there, please. Lie down and read. I can clean up. Fine. But don't you have to write... or read? How's your scribbling going anyway? Are you writing something or just lying around? But... Now... I think... Maybe... I sent something to a publisher. You sent something to a publisher? - Yes. But... I'm sure they won't take it. It'll work out. I'm sure, really. As long as I've known you you've been writing. For years now, writing, writing, writing. Did you hear something? Is he crying? Are you reading again? I thought you wanted to clean up. Is he asleep? - Yes. So you don't want to do the shopping? No gut's, hmm? No, I can't take it much longer. That guy never goes out. I just don't get it. No... Your parents! They're already here? They were going to come later. You think that's them? Nice. - Hmm. Well... hello... Congratulations about the baby. - Thanks! There you are! Finally! Congratulations on the birth of your baby. How nice! It's so nice! Finally we get to see our grandchild. I... We waited so long, didn't we? - Yes. Yes, we did. So, where is the child? But I can see him now, can't I? Have a seat. Thanks. Don't you want to see him, too? - No, I can wait till he wakes up. So, this is where you live... Yes, I do. - Yes. And you two, same as always? Yes, same as always. And the others? - The others? Ah, yes... I don't know. Not that I know of, anyway. That's how it is, hmm? - Yes. And you're doing fine? I can't complain. Same as always. But you have a job, don't you? Not so easy to find something, is it? No. But you're doing fine? Yes. Nice apartment... at least... central location... And on top of that... what? It must be expensive? - Quite, yes. But you're doing fine? Yes, sure. Somehow or other. Yeah... Now we're in the big city, too. Mom and I. Five and a half hours... no problem. Did you arrive yesterday, or... - Yes. We just wanted to look around. There's so much going on here, it's unbelievable! Yes... That's right. He's woken up? - Yes. He sleeps most of the day. - All day? So he doesn't cry much? He's calmed down now. Oh yes, sure... calmed down. You were pretty calm, too. Well, we just thought we'd stop by, you know, since we were here. Yes. I see. We won't stay long... Yes... How stupid of me to wake him. I didn't mean to. That was dumb of me. You have to see him, he's so gorgeous! You really have to see him! But I can't say who he looks like. No... but he's really gorgeous. Anyway, he doesn't look like you. You neither... No, he really doesn't look like you. And not like me either. And like her... So tell me, how are you doing? Everything's fine, thanks. - And the baby? - He's fine. So, now you're here. - We wanted to see the little one. Nice... So now you're in the big city. - Yes. Wow! What a city! I'll just go out to the store... - No, don't go to any trouble. - I'll be right back. We didn't expect you so soon. - We were a bit early, yes... We apologize. - No problem. We just wanted to stop by. I'll be right back. - But we need to go home today. - We have to! You have to look at the boy! Yes. You could... go in together. It can wait. - No, go have a look at him. Yes, come on. So, I'll just do some shopping. - You don't have to. But I can't offer you anything. - You really don't have to. I'll be right back. - We're leaving soon, anyway. No. Stay a while. Papa wants to go before it gets dark, you know? Okay... He's really a gorgeous baby. Nice for you two. Everything all right with you and the baby? Nothing unusual, all going to plan. - That's good. And now you're on maternity leave? Yes. - It's good that you have some time to take care of the baby. We brought a little present with us. Yes, really... Nothing big, a little something. We really wanted to bring something. Thank you. That's nice of you. A little something for the baby... A lovely baby. So... what do you say? Yes, a gorgeous boy. We got a present? Then open it. Thank you. - It's just a little something. It's... pretty. Yes. You never know what to get... Well... It's pretty, isn't it? - Sure. But who does he look like? What do you think? - I couldn't say. Not like you, anyway. No. Maybe... I really don't know. Anyway, you really have a gorgeous son! Now I'm going shopping. - Don't go to any trouble! We're going now, we must, right? - Yes, absolutely. Before it gets dark. We'll be back another time. For longer. You know... - That's how it goes. So why don't you just stay? That would be nice... but... You should come visit us sometime. The three of you. You really should, in summer, when it's warm. Come and see us. Okay? - Yes. Then... thanks for coming. Next time, stay longer, right? Yes, it was short this time, but that's how goes. Five and a half hours are five and a half hours. Thanks. Well then... Yes. You see? Nobody wants to be here. Not even your parents. They practically left before they even got here. And they barely believe you're the father. I don't think they like him at all. Of course they do. - I don't know. They like him. Why do you say that? They really like him. They like him a lot. - Alright, they do. Whatever you say. I'll do the shopping now, okay? You got a letter! A letter? - From a publisher. Aren't you curious? - Yes, a little. Maybe. - You were gone for so long. - Yes. I stopped by Marte's place. She's coming over later. What a day! First your parents, now Marte. We've never had so many people here. But your parents didn't really stay long. He's still sleeping? - Yes. He won't sleep tonight. He slept all day. I didn't even hear a peep from him. - Didn't you check on him? A couple of times. Now he'll have to wake up. But... Marte and I thought we'd go out tonight. Yes? - That's okay, isn't it? I can't sit around here the whole time, you know? She's coming soon, and then we're going out. I bought something to eat. You can eat it if you want. I don't feel like cooking. I ate at Marte's. Marte is coming here? - Yes. But she won't come up, with the mood you're spreading. - Yes. You were at Marte's? - Yes. Open the letter! No, not yet. - Why not? No. I'll go wake him up. He can't sleep all day. Or... You can wake him up, change his diaper and feed him. Sure, I'd be glad to. When's Marte coming? Any time now. I'm going to get ready. You understand, don't you? Even if you just want to sit around, I have to go out sometime. You hardly ever talk, you just lie there on the sofa and read. I know. - I used to see Marte a lot. She came over most days. We sat there and talked and laughed, and had fun. But since I live with you, it's impossible. Just impossible. - Yes, I know. Now open that letter! They don't want your stuff. But this time you thought it'd work out, didn't you? Yes, I thought so. How long do you want to go on with your scribbling? You can't just sit and write for years... Maybe you shouldn't write. I'm serious. Either a publisherwants your stuff, or you have to find something else to do. You can't just go on writing stuff that nobody wants. No. So, you're not going to see the baby now? He's sleeping so peacefully. Let him sleep. Then you'll change him when he wakes up, right? Is Marte coming later? - No, she's coming soon. But your parents... Barging in like that and then running off again... I'm sure they don't like the boy. Sure, because they don't like me. They never liked me. Yourfather barely looked at him. - No, that's not right. No? What is right? Yourfather didn't care at all. He's just shy and doesn't want to be a burden. Just like you. Does this look okay? Yes, sure. Sorry about the publisher. It's sad he isn't publishing you. I think I'll be off. That way you don't have to see Marte. When are you coming home? - Not so late. Just go to bed. - Hey... - Yes? My parents called. - No, really? On theirway. Something important? - Not really. Mama said she was so overwhelmed that she forgot to leave his present. A little toy or something. Nice of her to bring him something. She'll send the toy in the mail. They don't call that often. They'll call again from home. Must be Marte. - I just thought I'd tell you... Nice of you. I'm going now. Well... The diapers are in the bag. Is he awake? No. No? He's been asleep a while. He woke up a lot. It was hard getting him to sleep. He'd sleep, then wake up again... The whole time. The pacifier didn't help? No. Now he's sound asleep. Did he cry? You changed him? - Yes, twice. And fed him? - Yes. I didn't think you'd be awake. It's gotten a bit late. You sit waiting for me... Yes... no... He woke up, so I had to get up. He kept waking up, so in the end, I came in here. So you were in bed? - Yes. And you had fun? Yeah, sure. You met your girlfriend? - Yes. I mean... Marte, yes. But it's gotten so late. You were waiting? - Yes. Where the heck were you? Well... No, don't start that again! Why can't you tell me where you were? Can't we just go to bed? It's late. I want to sleep. I can tell you tomorrow, can't I? Okay. Just go to bed. Don't you want to come, too? - I don't think I can sleep. I'm tired, but I can't sleep. Sure you can, if you try. Yes. I am tired! But the car... I looked out to see if it was you. Who drove you home? I don't mean... Don't get me wrong, but... Now I can kiss the night goodbye. So, now I'm back. Ask away! No, I won't ask anything. I'm just a little tired. - Yes. Nothing special happened. So, now you know. What do you want to know, anyway? Where-were-you-who-were-you-with? You can tell me something, can't you? No, you don't have to. I was just worried. - Okay. I met my girlfriend, Marte, you know? We had something to eat in a caf?, then we went to a club. Then we went to another club. You want to know something else? No? Can we go to bed now? I'm tired. I want to sleep. I'll finish my drink, and then we go to bed. Yes? Okay? Can't you sit down with me and talk a bit? I can't sleep. I can tell. Can't we just talk? Talk. Really talk, yeah? Yes. I waited so long for you. Do you really have to go to bed now... I'm so tired. And I guess I'm a little drunk, too. If I have any more I'll definitely be drunk. Your book is being released. Look at that! Let's drink a toast! You don't just hang around and write, you're going to be published! Wow! Congratulations! Stop it. "Dear Mr... Thank you... ...pure literature..." They don't want it. "...doesn't meet our expectations regarding quality." - Give it back. No, they don't want it. Great letter. I worked on it at least a year. - Longer, for sure. Again and again... - Endlessly. But there are lots of publishers. Man, I'll be drunk soon. You drank a lot. But it hardly shows. I didn't drink that much, but wine is just what I need now. So, what did you do? No, no, no... I just sat here, pushed the stroller around, waited for you... Iooked out the window... Where were you? Aren't you going to tell me? You were with Marte? Yes. - Aha. No, it's too stupid. - Why? No, I can't, it's too dumb. Tell me. - No, I can't. - Why not? You weren't with Marte. Ah no? You... I never believed you. - No? You didn't? No? Well. - Stop lying! Marte asked me to say hi to you. She called right after you left. Okay, I wasn't... So, should we fight now? Orwhat do you want? Why can't we go to bed? We can talk tomorrow. The whole day. Come on. Let's go to bed. Come on! I'll tell you everything tomorrow. Come on, let's go to bed. Tomorrow I'll tell you everything. Tell me now. You weren't with Marte, anyway. Yes I was! You're lying! She couldn't have called, because she was with me. I know you and your tricks. I can't believe it... I know you well enough. But the car? Who brought you home? Yeah, yeah. Okay! We'll just sit here and stare. Or should we watch TV now, in the middle of the night? No, you go to bed. Yes. Really. You never leave the house. You aren't interested in anything. You just sit around and write. Like hell! Yes... Nobody comes, nobody stops by. And then your parents... just show up and leave again. Yes, I know. I know. But... But we're doing fine, aren't we? Don't you think? Sure... That's not it. And you wanted a child so much. Go ahead, start this again! That you are enough for yourself. That you never get bored. Can't you say something else? No. I'm going to bed now. You aren't interested in anything... You never go out. You never even do the shopping. You just stay inside and write, allegedly. I can't just sit and watch you, I can't. It drives me crazy. Tell me who brought you home! - No, stop it! Don't start that again! I'm tired. It's late. So late? I didn't know it was that late. Come on, let's go to bed. He'll wake up soon. In a couple of hours he'll be ready for action. Come on. Let's go to bed. You can cuddle me... Cuddle and sleep. Come on. Alright... Hey, can't we go to bed? We can cuddle, comfort each other. Why were you out so long? You knew I'd wait up for you. Why were you waiting? What for? You should go out too, now and then. You can't just stay inside. I can't stand it. You won't even take a walk. You never take a walk... Not even with me and the baby. - Yes. I can't stay in the whole time just because you do. That's not my thing. Something has to change. I have to see people. Yes. - If only someone stopped by, but they don't. Because you always hide. They walk in, and you sneak off to the bedroom. That's not okay. I can't go see people, and they can't come here! And when someone comes and you don't hide in the bedroom, you just sit here all stiff and weird. The mood's so stiff, it's unbearable! Even your parents ran away! It's all so stiff and awful and... No way! No. You're afraid of people. That's no way to live. You said you wouldn't be late... Yeah, yeah... But then you had so much fun... Fun. Yes, exactly. And the time just flew by? Yes, just like the rest of the night. Did you... Yes, I danced with a lot of men, and women, too. If that's what you want to know. I talked, had a good time. I ran into a couple of colleagues. I have to see them, even though I'm on maternity leave. But we're doing fine, aren't we? No. Yes, we're fine. That's not it. I know we're doing fine. We've been togetherfor so long. We're not doing bad, right? No. But we were so young. We met at school and then... Yes. You used to be different. It's getting worse and worse. I can't stay here all the time and look at you. Couldn't you... Get a degree or something, is that what you want to say? Yes. You have to do something. Look for a job. Something. - Put on a suit, look for a job, is that it? - Very funny. It'd be good if you earned some money. And this publisherwho didn't want your book... You can't just sit here and write, year in, year out! Something has to be published, or you have to do something else. But it's probably normal that what write doesn't get published. That's how it goes, right? Don't take it so hard. Don't worry about it. Maybe you just shouldn't write. Maybe that's it? - No. Maybe you should do something else. Maybe. I... I can't concentrate because he cries all day. You mean it was better before? Maybe not. Rejection isn't so bad, is it? It's at least the tenth. No... It can't be so many. - Sure. Yes, the tenth... at least. I didn't tell you about the others. But I just threw them away. Yes? Yes, I just didn't tell you. I got the mail and every time... I took the letters... Shouldn't we go to bed? They rejected me! One publisher after the other. Aren't you listening? Of course I'm listening, but I'm tired. You're not listening. You're just standing there staring. What are you thinking about? About the guy who brought you home? Can't you tell me who it was? Who was it?! Who brought me home? - Yes. I took a taxi. Yes, I did. Don't lie to me. I saw it. It wasn't a taxi. I saw you arriving. Okay. Somebody brought me home. But I couldn't just tell you that Baste brought me home. If I did that, all hell would break loose, and I could kiss the night goodbye. Alright. Baste brought me home. Now you know. So you met him earlier? Had Baste been drinking? - No. Imagine that! He hadn't. Why did you sit so long in his car? I didn't sit with him! Now stop it. No, I see. We just talked. I'm tired. I want to sleep. Why are you standing there dreaming? I'm not dreaming. - No? I have to see other people besides you. And go to your colleague's house? Late, at night, when you're free? No. - I know for sure. I know that you were with him, and not with your girlfriend. You can admit it. I can understand it. Really? Okay, I was with him. I was with Baste, the whole evening. At his place. Anything else you want to know? Go ahead! We drove around, listened to music, talked. That's what we did. And we went to his place. He and I, just the two of us. Are you happy now? - Is it true? No, I'm joking. It's not true? I was with Marte. That is the truth. And don't try to tell me she called. But I did... yes, I saw the car... Yes! Yes, I told you who it was. - You weren't joking? It was Marte's boyfriend. He picked her up and brought me home. So. Can we go to bed now? I can't... - You can't what? You've been lying the whole time. I'm not lying. - Yes, you are. I can see it. I'm tired. I want to sleep. You'd rather go out again and drive around, no matterwhere. Listen to music, have fun, go to this Baste's place. Anything but stay with me. Because I never go out... Then go! Get out! Just go! You don't have to stay. I don't care if you go. If you want to go to your Basti, orwhatever he's called, then go. I can go? Fine. What are you doing? You're awake? What are you doing? Can't you see? No! Say something. What is it? Say something! I'm moving out, can't you see? This is Baste. Yes, I called Baste. I called him in the middle of the night. And he came. Right, Baste? Yes. You're joking. - I'm not joking. I called Baste. I can't stand it here anymore... Can't you stop it? - No, why? I asked Baste to come over... ...to pick me up. Do you understand what I'm saying? No, no! Not that! I can't stand it anymore! Do you understand what I am saying? I'm leaving. I'm moving out. - No, don't say that. Wait in the hall. I'll be right there. Don't we love each other? It was him... who brought me home... yes... tonight... Baste. I'm sure you understand this. Tonight, yes... But you already know that. I told you. But you didn't believe me. You don't believe anything I say. I'm sure you understand. I was with him, not with my girlfriend. Don't you understand anything? I'll tell you something: Baste and I, we're in love. That's what it is, even if it sounds stupid. Baste and I, we're in love. For a long time now. We... So, now you know. - But... It's true. Don't you believe me? Doesn't matter. And if you really want to know, yes, we've slept together. Often. Tonight we did it in his car. Do you hearwhat I'm saying? Or are you a total moron? Don't you believe me? Don't you understand a damn thing? I'm leaving. So... now you can go to bed. Come in, Baste, You don't have to wait out there. Don't you believe me? Come here. Come and look at him! There. He's in the hallway. He was just in here. Didn't you see him? Well, he was here! Come and look! Come on! Look for yourself! You don't want to? He's right out there. Come in, Baste, he's harmless. Now you've seen him. You've seen him twice now. I was with him, like you say. We drove around in his car. Do you get it? Don't just stand there, say something! That's enough! Bye. Could you rock him a little? I got things for the baby. I'm not taking so much now. I'll be back tomorrow for the rest. I'm just taking a few things now. Baste and I have known each other a long time now, right? Yes... A long time? Maybe a year. But you're probably still the father. You can see it. You want to fight? It'll pass. That's how it goes. Yes. It all happened so quickly. For me, too, this here, but... Yes... She said you threatened her. But... So this is where I've been living. What do you say? Nice, right? Not bad, no... I was the one who found this place. He never does anything. He writes. Did you know that? You write? - And gets rejected all the time. It's not easy... writing. Orfinding a publisher. But he thinks... this guy... that it's easy. But he'll neverfind a publisher. He just keeps on writing and complains that the baby cries. When are you picking up your stuff? I bet you want to kill us now, him and me. What time are you coming for your stuff? It's awful that you're in such a hurry now. Can you rent a carfor the furniture? Can you do it tomorrow? Sure, no problem. What time? Doesn't matter? - Fine. The quicker the better. 'Cause of the baby's bed. We need that. Maybe you can get everything tomorrow. What do you say? - Yes... Sure? Yes. It shouldn't be this way. Really it shouldn't. In the middle of the night... - But I can't take it anymore. I just can't. Yes, but he... Don't worry about him. He'll be fine. Or maybe not... I don't care. He sure seems calm. Yes. Doesn't he even care? I don't know. I have no idea. Maybe he doesn't care somehow. Shouldn't we get going? I can't believe I actually came over here. I must really be in love. I'm crazy for sure. Me too. I can't be without you anymore. I think about you all the time. I have to be with you. There's no otherway. Really. And his parents... They are so horrible. And he's just like them. So stiff and awkward. His father just sat there and stared. Can we go now? Yes... I love you so much. And now we're together, you and I. - Yes. And don't ever leave me. Never leave me alone again. I'm serious. No, I promise... I'll never leave you. I'll stay with you forever. Forever... But let's go now, okay? I don't know what I'd do if you ever left me. No, I won't leave you. Never! But you know that. But you shouldn't leave me either. What's wrong? I need to pack some more. Don't change your mind now. No... It's not the time to look at photos. Hey, all that stuff... we can pick it up later. Just take what you need. We'll come tomorrow and get the rest. Can't we do it that way? It's late. Let's get going. - Yes. And... Well... I can't help thinking of him. You know what I mean? It's strange. The things won't let me go... Can't we go now? There's no need to stay. Yes, but it feels funny to go now... Just like that. - Don't mess around. We lived together a long time, he and I. We had a baby... Yes... Bought things, not so many, but some. It would be easier if we had lots of things. Not just a couple. A couple of pictures, bowls, sheets... That's why I say... Come on. So... Now... It's really sad. Everything is so wrong. I could almost cry, somehow... No, don't pay any attention to me. I'm just talking. That brass bowl... I've never seen anything so sad. Yes, really. Everything is so... I don't know. Knock it off. You called me... - Yes, I know. And that you and I belong together, there's no question. But he and I... He was always good to me. Yes, he was. And really good with the baby. He took care of him a lot. He was there at the birth, helped me as much as he could. I must have screamed like hell. And now... Should I go? - No. No, don't leave! I couldn't take that. I miss you when you're not here. Don't go. It's just that... It's so difficult and sad. Everything is so bad. It happened so suddenly. Something always happens, you know? Do you really know that? Something always happens. I don't like that. I want everything to be like always. I want things I know to happen, but the unknown always takes over. I don't know what it is, but there must be a reason. Is it my fault? Orwhat is it? I don't know. But can't we go now? We can talk about it later. Yes. You know what I'm thinking? It's really stupid. I'm thinking of the pans in the kitchen. I'm thinking that I'm leaving the pans. That's what I'm thinking. I'm out of my mind. Do you want to leave or not? You have to... You and I... We have to be together, right? It's so sad. Everything is so sad. - Come on. I think I'm sobering up. He's sleeping so peacefully. Did you see? Look! Yes, he's sound asleep. He had a rough night, I think. Did he tell you? - Yes. And now we're moving. Going to live somewhere else. And you... You'll be the daddy, kind of. No, I can't leave now! I can't. He was always good to me. He always wanted to do everything. And he's so helpless, he's scared to go out at all. Sometimes he doesn't go out for days, doesn't even go shopping... And his scribbling... It's no good at all... I'm sure that nothing he's written is any good. All he can do is write. But, of course, nobody wants to publish it. He's not good enough. He's not much good for anything. A total failure at school. He flunked once. We went to school together. But you know all that. I've told you before. Yes. Ever since we've been together. Orwe were... Yes. He's okay. But he's good for nothing. I had to take care of everything. On his own... I can't go. It's totally crazy, but I can't go. I can't... No way. And us? I don't know. I love you. I am in love with you. I can't live without you... That's what it feels like. But I don't know. I can't leave either. Not now, anyway. What time are we meeting? I don't know, but we have to! No! - No, make up your mind, once and for all! I'm staying here. I don't know. I miss you already. But I can't go either. Not like this anyway. So we'd better not meet so often. It'd only make things worse. - No. Don't say that. You shouldn't say that. We must see each other. I love you so much. What now? Decide. This is no go! No way! It's crazy. Come on. You're not coming? Alright. You can't come? Then I'll be going. Yes. You don't love me. Not enough, anyway. That's good to know. No, that's not true and you know it. - Well, at least I know that. Don't go!
