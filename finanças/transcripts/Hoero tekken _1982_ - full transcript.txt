He is just like Toru used to be. My name is Joji Hibiki. No. As of today your Joji Hinohara. And i happen to be your late fathers younger Brother Ikeda Hinohara. That means im your Uncle. Joji. Is it true? My little brother Joji has come back? It seems like a dream. It's true. It's a lot to take in. Until we sold the house it was the Hinohara family house. I see you like that music. This music box was a present for my 19th birthday. It was given to me by our father. He had it made in Europe for me. For a person who is blind we start to rely on sound and this music is the only tie i have to our parents memory. Toru also loved this music. Had you already become blind when you received the gift. Yes. I could see until i was 9 then they said i had separation of the retina. Toru refused to believe in less for me and became driven. He went to study Ophthalmology in London at a University. I know he will come back one day. Until then let me help. Thank you Joji. Sister. Joji. You'd never think she was blind would you? No. She's good. Been at it 5 years. I persuaded her. Your father was against it but she kept at it. You can see that im a fan of hand to hand combat. I'm an advisor to the Western Japan Martial arts association. Want to hear how it's helped? Ever since i started to practice martial arts ive had more focus and confidence. Without being able to see you know what to look out for if there is trouble? - You know the Wind? - The Wind!? Yes. The movement of the air. If i expand. Focus my mind and hearing sense i know when there's danger. Today me you long time friends. Well be good sportsmen. Sure. Spartacus.

I'm grateful that so many of you have come tonight. To club Phoenix to enjoy an evening of bewitching attractions. Your laying it on pretty thick. I'm not flattering them. You think if you did you would get more money? Maybe if you work harder we will both get a raise. Never happen. Why not? Because i heard the owner of this place is a real tight ass. Look. You don't have any class. But i got that from you. Hey! Look at the country bumpkin. What are you looking around for? I'm talking to you. With the white suit on and putting on airs. Hey. Hey. That's no way to talk to people in the audience. But it's the truth. The truth is never popular. It's true. And you better be careful. Your sitting close to a murderer. Stupid. This is no Police drama. The murderer - gave a cup of coffee to the pilot - of a certain private plane. To help him stay awake. To help him fall asleep. What? The coffee had a lot of sleeping pills in it. What did you say? And the Cessna crashed, and his wife also died with him! So the mystery ends. But it's not over yet. The murderer was never caught. And he is still up to no good! You'd better stop all this now. But i cant stop, i wont stop, i cant. Hiccup. I can say whatever i want. Life is real tough isn't it? Right Country Bumpkin? Well, i gotta go. Bye bye! Bye Bye! Fucking Bullshit! Didn't you like the show. Boss you have a message. Joji. I have to go for a moment. Stay and relax ok. Joji. Look.

Kyoto Graveyard.. Hinohara Crest.. Gravestone.. Father. I think i get it now. Chihiro's parents thought of leaving a message one only she would ever be able to read written in braille. A 130 Carat Diamond. Fantastic! Chihiro can i borrow it once in a while? Why would you do that? Ah! I would wear it during parties and make everyone jealous! Don't be silly. You cant just put a diamond before this little girl. Your bad! Joji. Lets go tell uncle. He wants to exhibit it at Portopia. Joji-san, don't you want uncle to know? Later i have something important to tell you. - Wait here, ill go and get the Jewel. - Yes and i can take you there. KYOTO JAPAN Hinohara Family That's it. That must be the jewel. Sister Jesoma! My what a disgrace! Oh save us. Reika common hurry up! Reika hurry! - Oh! Excuse us! - Drive carefully. Here they come again! Joji, leave them up to me. Just take that Diamond with you and run ok? Go! You'll be alright? Ill be alright im a fifth level Karate student. - Fifth level? - Yes get going! Get out of here! Ah! He's gone. You lost him? You idiot! Go, don't come back unless he's found. Kumozawa don't be so hasty. I still have one more ace up my sleeve and im going to play it now. Man that was terrible. Joji-san! I'm dying of thirst. What's this? Still in one piece? Chihiro went to the hospital. Hospital? Reika's father came to get her! Joji's hurt that's what he told us. Poppa came?! But why would he lie? Hello Casablanca. Hinohara? Hello. Hello? Joji. Chihiro is here with me. Whether she lives or dies is entirely up to you. Where is she? Where are you keeping her? I'll exchange Chihiro for the Queen of Sheba. In four hours bring it to the summer house at edges and beech. You'll keep her safe till i get there. Hello. This is Reika. Is my father there let me speak to him. I've been listening to this music ever since i was a little boy. In the slum through the wind and rain. Even when i had nothing to eat i carried the memories of Beethoven with me. Hiraoka and the word in German is Hiros. Ill tell you what the translation is. HIRO! The demi-god Hiro! Now there's nothing for you to cry about. Once i get the Queen of Sheba then you're free. Im not crying because im afraid of dying. Then why the tears? Having a man like you as part of our blood a relative in our family! My mother grew up poor and miserable. In a world with no love a Geisha. Used and thrown into the flames. And while staring at the Hinohara mansion that was standing upon the hill who was the little boy whose hand she held as she died? It was me. And on that day i knew i had to become the owner of that mansion! Poppa! Reika! Why are you here? Poppa tell me, why did you tell lies to bring Chihiro here? Tell me poppa! Reika! Don't ask questions. Let's go. From now on we can go back and live in peace like we used to. NO! You have to stay here to make sure our little deal will go smoothly. But boss! That's not what you told me. My part in this is over. Boss! That's enough! Joji. The Queen of Sheba I assume you have it with you. Let me see my sister. Sister. Joji give them the Diamond it isn't worth the trouble. In return. I want uncle to leave the Hinohara family. If he wont accept, that i rather die here. Yes. I accept the conditions. Joji give him the diamond. Together we will have something more valuable. If it's alright now well leave. Reika. Whoa! Poppa! Joji! Joji i have something to tell you. That airplane accident involving your parents was no accident it was me! And your brother Toru I had a syndicate from Hong Kong take him out cold. Now i will take the Queen of Sheba to Hong Kong and bring the Hinohara family into a new Dynasty. Uncle... You fools! Disrupt her ability to hear so that she will lose her concentration! Finish her with an injection. Even an autopsy would not detect the poison. No. Give her some Heroin just short of a lethal dose. Heroin is the ancient assassin of morality and conscience. Soon she will be crawling on her knee's begging for more. I'll send anyone to a hell worse than death if they try to come against me. Nobody is going to stop me! How many days have we been in here? Forgive me Joji-san! Poppa was tricked... Chihiro is doomed! Your father is not to blame. Be brave. People are born alone and die alone. They struggle their entire lives. In America my father told me so. You've been here two days. I bet you guys are getting pretty bored. I'm here to make it interesting for you. Your going on an Auschwitz honeymoon. So. How's your Auschwitz honeymoon going? It's not like Natzi gas. It's much better. In ten minutes you'll both go crazy. And then you will die... Reika quick grab the whip! Take care of Peter. - But Joji! - I have to find my sister. Now go on. Joji-san! Sister. Sister. Sister! Wake up it's me Joji-san! Sister! Joji.. Your still alive thank God. Let's go. Let's leave this place forever. Sister come. Joji i cant go on. Go ahead without me. No way! Common. I know it.. I'm going to die. Sister. What are you saying? Sister! Sister! Joji. There are certain things in this life you should never give into.. even if it means your life. Take revenge for all of us. Keep fighting for me and Toru. Watch out! Oh what beautiful clarity! A fascinating stone! This is the very Diamond i see in my dreams! I had been searching for a Jewel as precious this almost all of my life. I'm glad that your satisfied. And now I think that i would like to see what you promised. Something like this would be very easy to bypass customs in Japan. How very thoughtful of you. Without a doubt this is good stuff. I would say our little business transaction was a success. Where did Mr. Koshi move to? There he is get him! Welcome to Hong Kong. And you. Just who are you and why are you following me? Because we are both after the same game. My name is Tochikawa Shinksi. Im with the Narcotics division of Interpol. So your a Policeman? Your brother Toru died right here. His body was riddled with bullet holes. Your Uncle is a lot more ruthless than you think. I'll advise you to let us handle it from here. I refuse. As an official i cannot allow you to keep on interfering. Just stay out of this. This is something i have to take care of personally. Ok fine. You leave me no choice. Your under arrest. Better be careful. Think before you make your next move you only have one life. I'm none of your worry. I'll get Ikki by myself. Well do you even know where Ikki is? Keep quiet and follow me. Yo Chen-tung! What do you guys want? Your under arrest for violation of international Narcotics law. What's that? Ikki.. Where is Ikki Hinohara! I don't know! Lung Tow..at my villa. Lung Tow? Ok ride's over Joji. And now, to a fortune in bananas we'll raise a toast. Kampai! Kampai! Kampai! Boss. They call this island the Sleeping Beauty, it's not bad at all. All that's left now is to mix our bananas up with another shipment and have them sent to Japan. The election for your seat in congress is getting pretty close. I know that your gonna make it. And then ill become secretary of a congressman. And then to the Minister of Trade and Industry. And after that the Secretary of the Prime Minister. Joji. So you survived. You've justified being my relative in blood. Uncle. And you, for your treacherous ambitions, you've murdered the whole Hinohara family. Only one bullet left. Wouldn't it be better to save the last bullet for yourself? Wait a minute ou're my own nephew! We both have the same Hinohara blood flowing through our veins. You're wrong! I'm Joji Hibiki. The Hinohara family died.... for something like this. Joji Hinohara, you're under arrest. -Take care of the rest. - Yes. So now you'll spend the rest of your life in prison. That's ok. I took revenge for the Hinohara family. Now that i'm all alone I've got nowhere else to go. That's not like you at all. Because you're alone, wouldn't you like to take off and fly away? I thought Mr. Magic taught you the trick to slip out of handcuffs! Make sure you don't get arrested by another Joker like me. Tochikawa!
