Force! Here we go! - Can you use that? - Your father taught me that. Ok, this way! My dad always wanted me to spend more time with my mom but I doubt he had that in mind. Dear friends and new readers, I'm Nikki and this is my blog. After my father's recent death, I was snatched away from my friends and ended up in this horrible situation that I cannot control. Now, I'm 10,000 meters high, on a direct flight to the Czech Republic, a country I don't know, forced to live with Eve the woman who brought me into the world. I know nothing about her except for some news read online. I will miss all of you and our amazing adventures. Horseback riding, walks, days at the beach and everything in between. I'm sure I'll have tons of meaningless adventures to share with you on this blog. Eve is a scientist. Dad told me that since he was in school he wanted to improve the world. We are located in the Benesov District, in the Czech Republic, where citizens have relied on hydroelectricity for 60 years generated by the Ceb dam, but now there is great news on the horizon. It is called Helios. We are in the Promethean Kinetics lab with Dr. Carter, known for her commitment to development of Third World Countries, the Helios project. We are far from the water collection facilities in Africa. Can you tell us a little about this adventure? I've always been interested in new sources of sustainable energy. My team and I have developed Helios, a particular mixture of gases extracted from the surface layer of the earth's crust. This combined with hydrogen allows combustion without the emission of waste. This happens at a depth of 70 meters thanks to a high-power conversion turbine system we call Medulla. Why the Czech Republic in particular? Europe is full of abandoned coal mines and we want to recycle them. Our pipe network extends between coal mines across the country. Coal? It is a new 100% safe substance and it is pure energy produced by the planet. It looks like the fracturing process that has caused serious problems in the United States. It is a new procedure, completely different from fracturing. We have achieved splendid results. There are still those who say you are exporting a toxic practice from America. Promethean Kinetics or... PK. It is not an American company. Okay, but there is no documentation on who is actually funding the project. What I can tell you is that everyone involved in the project only cares about one thing, the health and safety of the planet for all of us. - Thank you, Dr. Carter. - Imagine, thanks to you. We continue with the debate between Russia and the United States on oil in Ukraine. - Who would you be? - Henrich. My wife and I own the house where your mother lives. Here. You and Eve were arrested on that Greenpeace ship in Antarctica, right? A long time ago! So, are you sleeping with Eve? Thing? No, I'm married, I told you! - Her name is Olivia. Now, you will meet her. - Agree. As usual, Eve has let me down again. In the picture your mother has, you look younger. My mother? I call her Eve. You know, she was very sorry she couldn't have come here today. Let me guess. Absurd times, time has flown away, fire, flames and all the rest. Absurd times, I think. This is a new chapter in your life Leave the past behind and live in the moment. Yes, right! What could I expect from the woman who abandoned my father and me 12 years ago. Now, I am stuck with her until I am 18. We're almost there and there's a surprise at home too. - You will like it for sure. - I doubt it. It seems that Zeus and Catherine like you a lot. Perfect, an exciting new chapter for my blog, Nikki and the chickens. We have not met anyone or anything for miles. Who knows if Eve at least remembers that I have diabetes! I wish I could blame her. But instead I inherited it from my father. The doctor said diabetes contributed to the heart attack that killed my father. - Good! - Thank you! Good job! - Did I go well? - You were great! How about? Didn't I look too much of an educated monkey? You were sure of yourself, with a little bit of caution. Ok, thanks everyone, let's get back to work. So? All in order? - Negative. - Thing? It's best if you take a look here. My God, I don't feel like activating the system on Monday with these numbers. - Me neighter. Declan doesn't see it that way. - Declan! She always has other ideas. - What is that? - From me. - Declan, won't it be celebrating soon? - A couple of days. - Maybe more than two. - What are you talking about? Tests still need to be done. Just as long as these tests say we can move on. We will see, but in the meantime that brings bad luck. I'll put it in the cooler. Rather, the consortium appreciated your way of handling the press. Good. Don't you think it's time to tell us who the investors are? - I'll tell you. - When? At the right time. On the Internet they are already shouting conspiracy. You are in a difficult position, my dear. Look, Europe trusts us and we don't want to be compared to a bunch of Texan fracturing machines. - Are you done? - Yup. - Well, you have some tests to do. - Okay. Pretend you don't care. I don't want to know where the money comes from. - Law and sausages. - Sausages? You don't want to know where they come from. Killian, could you take a look at this for me? Of course. - Wait for me. - Today is the big day, right? - Today? - Nikki. Yes, Henrich picked her up at the airport. - Has Henrich gone? - Yes, Henrich went. I could not. Ok? I had the interview and this afternoon is the test. It's just a routine test. I don't know what to say to a 16 year old girl. Try a little. What did you do when you were 16? I studied mathematics, equations, I read chemistry magazines. - Exciting. - A party girl! Go home to your daughter. Okay, I'll go there when we're done with the test. Here we go! Ok, come on, let's go! Come on, come on, come on! I admit, I'm excited to see her. What is going on around here? At the end of the street is the bus stop that takes you to the city. Good to know. Eve will be home soon. Welcome, Nikki. I'm Olivia. - Hello. - Take a seat. Come on! The suitcase. Who expected it! No trace of Eve! At least there are Zeus and Catherine. - Are you hungry? - No thank you. - All right. - Stop fracturing. Let's save the whales. Nothing has changed. - No at... - Do you want to see your room? - Yes, of course. - This way. Thank you. Here we are. Are we kidding? Do you think I'm five? I'll show you the house if you want. We might as well see the rest. Ok. Follow me, I want to show you your surprise. What's the matter, guys? This thing has broken five times in the past five months. Relax, Killian is working on it. In fact, Killian is working on getting Dr. Carter to bed. - Are you done there? - Yes. Let's hope it holds up. There are two of us, man. Okay, let's check the resistance. Killian, increase flow by 10%. Automatic opening started. - Pressure set at... 10%. - Okay. All right. Let's bring it to 40. Twenty, 30... Forty. - This was a very strong shock. - Yeah, it must be the transformer. - What is the pressure in Medulla? - 42.6%. - He's getting up. - Yeah, ok, we need to decrease it. Do you think it depends on the control valves? - It can be solved, right? - Probably, but in Medulla the level was to 42%. We shouldn't be recording these results. Okay, check both valves. We don't continue if it doesn't resolve. Sure, I'll go right down to take a look. And you, go home. Ok. Wait a second. A test was scheduled for Monday. How long will it take? We need to check the security of our systems. Thing? For a clogged valve? If we do that, we lose a lot of money. Do you know there could be very serious consequences, Declan? Don't think like a capitalist. This is not your little science project. It was probably your idea, but it was bought and funded by the people I represent. Do you know, yes or no? Yes, of course I know. And they want it to work, right? I want it ready and they want it to work. For this we have to do other tests, Declan. I'm in it too, just like you. Replacing a sensor is pretty simple. So, let's get a move on and activate the Helios. No, we're not putting the Helios into circulation now. We will continue with the inert gases until we ensure that all are working at their best. - Only then can we use the Helios. - You said it's easy to fix. I didn't say it's easy. Let me explain, Declan. the Helios under pressure is like a supercharged flammable liquid and the Medulla is what regulates how much we pump from coal mines. I don't think you want to risk the valley being destroyed. I err? In fact, we have a control system and a backup system. That may not work. Let us work. Agree. Find the cause of the problem and fix it. - Killian will. - Killian does what you tell him to do. Because Killian knows I'm right. I don't want to make things difficult. I have some personal matters to handle. My daughter landed a little while ago. I have to go home. Look, that's how she went today, so let's leave it alone. Go to your daughter. - Ok, sure? - Come on, get out of here. Can we hurry? I have an appointment. - What does it say over there? - 8.2. Higher than usual, I don't like it. We need to solve the problem first. Goldman, recalibrate the system. - It's Friday, let's go home. - Not yet. Hi, you called my dad. Leave a message. Killian, this is Eve. I know you will probably still be in Medulla but I'm a little worried. I don't know, wait. Okay, there they are. It's just that... Do you know what? It doesn't matter, I have to go home and leave work alone. I'm free all weekend. See you on Monday. Hello. Stop worrying. She activates that damned Medulla. - Carter went home. - Yup. Is everything okay now? It appears to have been a software problem. It's all right. - The sensors? The redundancy systems? - All in order. Optimal. So, I want to proceed with the test and activate the Helios. - As he said? - You heard what I said. Any problems? But we wanted to do a series of tests before activating it. I'm not sure if the software was the only problem. And delay again? Can you explain it to the investors later? - Declan! - I want the system to be activated. It's clear? I've been clear? Or do I have to fire you all and go looking for a new team? Proceed with activation. Received. We take the commands of the Medulla. Let's prepare the test. Let's get to work and don't think about what could go wrong. We shouldn't do this, he's not ready. Increase the flow to maximum and release the Helios. You come. You will see, you will like it. And... surprise! Eve and Killian like to ride horses up in the mountains. Why don't you feed him? So you will quickly become great friends. - Here, like this. - So cute! Good good. Keep it up. - Your mother just started it. -I didn't know you painted. She looks like him. A bit'. I've done it at least 50 times. You look good. Me or the horse? Both of them. I was showing Nikki around the house. - Good. Do you like your room? - Not exactly. You can furnish it as you wish. I thank you. - Have you eaten? Sh e-she was waiting for you. Dad and I had dinner together on Fridays. - Today is Friday, right? - Yup. - Loud. - Here we go. Let's eat and rest. Tomorrow we will go to town. - Good. - I do. - As you want. - Go talk to Nikki. I do. No, no, that's fine. -Where is she? -In her room. Has she been there the whole time? She hasn't touched any food since you returned. -She is punishing me, I know. -She is scared. - From what? - From you. - From me? She doesn't make any sense. - No? A woman he does not know enters his life and pretends to be a mother. What does this mean? Me, you and Henrich have chosen to be activists also to make a difference but some of us have chosen not to have children. Olivia, please! It wasn't my choice. Yes, but you decided it was her father who raised her. Now, you have to earn her trust before she is truly her mother. Thanks for the encouragement, indeed! Do not mention it! Hi, friends, check out this compromising video about PK and Eve's latest discovery. It is shown in detail... - Man, Eve! Can't you knock? - I wanted to see what you were doing. - I write on the blog. - For real? About what? How bored I am here. What do you want? I just wanted... Thing? I wanted to tell you that I am very sorry for your father. It was a year ago. I know but we've seen so little since then. I received your flowers. I would have come to the funeral, but my work stopped me. That's what you wanted. You know, I don't know what your father told you, but... - It really mattered to me. - You have a strange way of showing it. In any case, have you decided to become a vegetarian? Not me. So, could I have some meat for lunch? - I did it because you're diabetic. - Meat, Ive. I need protein. Ok. Ive, there are people for you. I arrive. It will take me a minute. Don't make them wait. Am I not entitled to rest one day too? The fact that my phone was turned off could be a clue. - Sorry, but we need your help. - In what? We activated it. The Helios. What the hell are you talking about? Killian? Perhaps, you have no idea what risk you are taking. Will you help us or not? Help you? I don't think it helped when you made that stupid decision! There are small changes in pressure that alter the systems. You have to check them. He will never forgive me. Who? This new energy company created by the Czech Republic. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a very great CIA conspiracy. Nikki. - Come on, go. - It's about something... Get out! She doesn't want to see me, I don't want to see her. So, enough, I'm leaving. I'm sorry you're locked up here. I have come to greet you. You don't look like you. The situation is getting worse. The pressure on the relief valve has increased by 49%. - I need to check this data. - Ok, I'm here with you. - What's going on? - Nothing good. - It's 52%. - It's all OK? It is climbing faster than it should. Fuel pumps are okay, but pump more Helios than normal. - Sensor went to number nine. - Try to disable it. The back pressure will damage the whole system. - That was a bad idea, Declan. - I did what needed to be done. - Do you know what happens if everything skips? - Just a few bangs. It's working. - So, we can follow the procedure. - Damn, Declan. You don't know what you're saying at all. Stop everything. I proceed. - Very low pressure in the system. - It's the valve that re-establishes itself. Do you know for sure, Declan? Check it out. - The system is broken. - There is no answer from Medulla. - The whole system is out of order. - I load the backup systems. - The rotors are gone. - It wasn't supposed to happen. Everyone shut up! Everybody get out of here! Quick, quick! Out! Run away, quick! My God! Copper, Goldman, Plint, Slater, get ready! We have to reach Medulla. We have to manually disable it. We can't go there, it's too dangerous. Are you deaf? Move! Here we go! If I were you, I would start thinking about how to limit the damage. I think we have a problem. Do not worry. It is not at all prudent. It'll be fine until it catches fire. Then, nothing can help us. Concentrate, we have less than a minute to deactivate it. Check for any leaks. I have a really bad feeling. A Helios reflux is filling the room. - Twenty seconds, guys. - This is bad. - Fifteen seconds. Slater, fast. - Here is a leak. No, don't touch it! Get out of here, get out of here! Killian! Killian, what's going on? - There is a leak of Helios in Medulla. - How much Helios pumped? - A lot and still continues. -He will go to all the tunnels under the city. Congratulations! You just destroyed all our work! And now? If the fire reaches the mines, the whole country will be destroyed. The whole area will be uninhabitable for at least 60 years. Another explosion! No, worse. Where are you going now? You can't leave. You can't do this, stay here. - We have to fix it now! - It's your fault! Red alert. Everyone run for cover! Come on, go! - Open the doors. - Why don't they open them? Relax, it will be fine. The Medulla does not respond. We can't contain the fire. Again, we can't contain it. We have to get out of here. - Open the elevator doors! - Carter is gone. How do you mean? He'll call her back now. It does not matter. I evacuated all personnel. Listen, Declan. Open the elevator doors and we will find a solution. No I will not do it. Declan, what the hell are you saying? Open the elevator! I'm so sorry. Declan, there are people down here. Let us in. Declan! We will die down here! Why doesn't he want to help us? To save his ass. Okay, guys. We have to take off these suits. They are full of Helios. If we're quick, we'll get to the north shaft. OK let's go. I hope Carter finds a way to stop the Helios before he gets to Prague. - What if he can't? - Game over. Killian, call me! The Helios is causing explosions. How do we stop it? Declan, did you notice they're evacuating the city? There's a bit of confusion. Confusion? This time we got it really big. Yes, there were some risks. And now I'm seeing it for myself. Nikki! Thank goodness you are fine! Nikki, are you okay? We're fine, we're fine. It looked like a classic California 6.5 shock. - You don't look good. - What happened? There's been an accident at the plant. It's almost sure, there will be another shock. - We have to leave. - Because of that idiot? - There's no use arguing. - Hell, Eve. I told you. They will use your technology for evil purposes. - Stop it, Henrich. - Did your company cause all this? - Isn't it time to talk about this? - And when, then? We get water, torches, matches. Nikki, I want you to fill this bag. Take her to the car. Come on, let's hurry up, come on! - Come on, Nikki. - Nikki, go! Go! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Quick! We can't let it all burn. We must do something. Nikki, jump up! Horses! I have to free the horses! Nikki! Do not close the door. I free them immediately! - Ok, ok. - Okay. I'm taking her out. We hope he follows her. - Force! - Come on, beautiful! On! Come on then! Run Run! Run! Good! Let's go let's go! Come on, let's go! Can you hear me? Carter? - They're calling you. - Come on, let's go! - They're looking for you. - Who? - Can you hear me? - Get in the car. - So, did you join Nikki? -She's fine. In the car! What do you want? What are you going to do now? I'm taking Nikki to safety and then trying to fix your mess. It is late, the fire has destroyed everything, Medulla and the rest. - Killian? - Died. Son of a bitch! Why didn't you listen to me? I told you it wasn't ready! - So, what are you going to do now? - I don't know what I'm going to do either. - Or rather, what will you say? - I'll tell everyone the truth. That you forced Killian to activate the Helios when he wasn't ready yet! Your word against mine. In everything, you will be complicit. Accomplice? Is this how he is going to end? You know what? And who cares! It's your choice. Let's move! - Eve, you go. - How? - We stay. - No, what do you say? - Rightly so. - It's not safe here. This is the only place Olivia and I consider our home. It is not easy to leave it and go around the world again. But let's go! We have done it so many times. We can do it again! No, by staying here we can still prevent the flames from knocking it down. - We'll be fine, Eve. Don't worry. - No, please. - Eve, let's go! - Go! You have Nikki and we have the house. - Are you sure? - Yes, of course! - Listen to them! - Go! Christ! Thank God there is still some current. It's madness to take us there. We are not miners. - Don't freak out, okay? - It doesn't seem that strange to me. I care about my life. Did you see what happened to Plint? I don't want to die. There will be a way out, right? There is, for sure. - And now? Game over? - Okay, now stop it. We have 12 hours before the oxygen runs out. We need to find the emergency exit and get to safety. she's too far away. Look, I don't promise you anything, but I guarantee that I'll do what I can to get out of here whole. Ok? - Copper. - Yes, OK. Let's stick together and go this way. Courage! I'm sorry, but you can't stop them from saving their home. - They're important to me. - I know it! - How do you find horses? - Thing? Do you know Olivia and Henrich's horses? Frao and Fraulina. - I never understood those names. - Are you serious? I taught your father to ride. - Everything is fine? - They'll blame you for all this. For sure, my boss Declan will. Perhaps, he is right. Do you really believe that? I've seen you maybe twice in the past two years. - I know absolutely nothing about you. - Check on the tablet if there are any news. - Do you think that's true? - What? That the CIA funded Medulla knowing it would explode. They try to bring troops to Ukraine for oil-related issues. - It's ridiculous. - No, not at all. - We got lost. - Stop whining, Copper! Force! A large leak occurred from the Helios chemical plant causing multiple underground fires. Could this be the cause of the ongoing earthquakes? At these extreme temperatures the Helios manages to burn by literally digging uncontrollable underground channels just like the fault lines that in contact cause earthquakes. This NASA image shows us how Helios burns underground. As you can see, it is heading towards Prague at a great speed. The Helios fire must be stopped or else the city will be destroyed in 12 hours. and with it thousands of human lives. - How long will it burn? - It's hard to say. We are trying to contact Dr. Carter who created this substance but we cannot. We have Declan Glas with us who will tell us what happened. My company believed in Dr. Carter. You have not only betrayed our trust but also that which Europe placed in you. This is a blow to me as I considered Dr. Carter a dear and sincere friend of her. Nikki, what are you doing? - Nikki! Nikki, don't do this! - Let me out! Ok. Niki, stop! What are you doing? Get back in the car right away! - I'm done with you. - Where are you going? - At home! - Stop! Is this your home! Here? Right in the middle of your stupid experiment? It was not my fault. My science is safe. Did you abandon me and dad for this? When she said, "Your mother is trying to save the world." She kept repeating it to me before she died. She has always admired you. Probably, she still loved you. This is crap. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - You didn't do anything! - I'm trying. - I hope they blame you! So you get what you deserve! Let's get back in the car, let's go! - Force! - You hurt me! Sit here next to me! Enter! Put on the belt. Put it on! - My God! - What was it? My God! Get out of here! Rapid! My God! - Open the door. Open the door! - I can not make it. - Come on, get out! - I can't open it! - Go out! - My God! Damn! - Henrich, Olivia! What are you doing here? - We could ask you the same question. I do not believe. I'm looking for Carter. -He's gone. - I want to help you. Do not tell me? I'm sure with all the problems you have, you better leave. But what is all this hostility? -I just want to make up for the mess of him. - Was it her? - Yes why? What did she tell you? - What about? Of the accident. She said that if anything someone had come here and said it was her fault for not believing a single word. I had guessed. I was starting to worry about her. - Calm. - Where I am? You stay calm, in a reception camp. Welcome... You are not a doctor! I am not a doctor. Luckily, I found her car in time. - Where is my daughter? - Let me guess. Nikki? -Yes. -She's fine. Her head was spinning a little, but she's fine. -Where is she? Take me to her. -If she calms down, that's what I'll do. My God, I'm the worst mother in the world! Calm down, okay? I hope that one day she will be able to forgive me. - My God! -Why don't you help us by giving us a hand? Sure, but I don't know what to do. We haven't been trained for this either. - Luckily you're here. - We lost two trucks with medical supplies and we are understaffed. - Okay. So what do I do? - Look around. These people are terrified. Try to reassure them. Captain, come quickly! Excuse me. Nikki! Nikki, are you okay? Treasure! Thank God you are fine! - Everything is OK? - Yes. There are so many people. Already. Is full. And who are they? I think they lost their son. I would like to do something to help them. - Maybe, I could go talk to him. - And say what? What do you mind? Nikki, what should I do? I'm really sorry. You know what? You have to help me with the next patient. Here we go! So, we need an alternate transport since you destroyed the last one. Ok. Repair engines now? Dad liked the idea that you were an all-round engineer. He tried it with me too. - Did he succeed? - In fact, no. I'm more of a theoretical engineer. You know, he was super smart too, Eve. I know it. He was very smart. This is also why I married him. What do you need? Give me the wrench. What's wrong? Where is the insulin? I'm fine. I just have to eat something or... - Where's your kit? - I do not know. - This is serious. - You shouldn't have had the accident. I don't... listen, sit down and stay here. I will be right back. We should be close by now. - It's super tight below. - Okay, let's keep calm. Here we pass better. I hope Diane and her are okay. I'm sure so. - What's going on out there? - I don't know, okay? Come on, walk! This way, come on! Yes, it looks like the right way! Close ranks! Killian, it's me. I used to come to you looking for answers, but you... it doesn't matter. Cabbage! The dam! We have five hours before the Helios reaches Prague. - Sorry, sorry, I have to see... - Dr. Carter, what do you think you're doing? I need to see a map. Okay, so here we are. The dam is here. And if we open the gate like this, the whole valley will be flooded. - Female doctor! - I need to speak to the field officer. - It's about Nikki. - Thing? - Come with me. - But.... is she okay? What happened? Nikki! Nikki, Nikki! I am here. - Pope? -You are diabetic, right? Yes, I can't find the insulin kit. I gave her some fruit juice, but it's not enough to get her back. Captain, when you found us in the car, did you see an insulin kit? - No, no insulin. - There is not here. - See what I can do. - We need some juice. Look, I'm Captain Hill. Bring something sweet to the medical tent. Now! Look at me, stay with me. Stay with me! Do you know what? Juice is not enough. You need insulin. Look, with all these evacuees, we're running out of supplies. - Here you are, sir. - That's all? Is that all that's left? - Yes, that's all. - Thank you. - Come on. - Negative, corporal. We need to focus on the injured. Let the local forces think about the looting! - You don't have insulin? - Look, there's a town nearby. - Okay? We will check if there is a pharmacy. - Can anyone go there? It is not possible. Another team will arrive in the morning. In the morning? It will be too late in the morning. - You need insulin now. - Female doctor... - I'll go. - How will he get there? He will use the motorcycle. - You'll make it? - Yup. - You know, I have a son Nikki's age. - For real? What's your name? Tom. Look, I have to be honest with you. I don't think that's a good idea. I have another plan. Try to stop the fires. Flood the valley with water from the dam. Of course! And the government? Do you think he'll let him? Look, the Helios will burn for 100 years if we don't stop it. Look, this goes... this is way beyond my rank. Look, if he wants advice, now he has to think about her daughter. I know it. Her face is all over the news. Remember the plant accident? What they say? Look... You take this and be careful. - I hate guns. - Listen to me. There are many people who believe it was her. Ok? I risk court martial for this. I want you to be back within the hour. - I promise. Thanks, captain. - My name is Derek. Good luck. He will serve you. - Need help? - Captain, yes. I am looking for a woman and her daughter. I think they were here. - The Americans? - Yes, yes. Can he tell me where I am? They left the base. Someone will be looking for us. Declan must have said we're dead. - Didn't you find anyone? - None, there is no signal. Declan is crazy. He interrogated prisoners in Vietnam. - Wait. - What... what's going on? This... this crossroads shouldn't be there. - We walked for hours. - You mean we got lost? Let me think. We have to go, go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, come on, come on! Street! My God! We are trapped! Come on, let's go! - Over here! - Over here! - I need insulin, Eve. - I know it. I'm looking for it, ok? - Stay close to me. - Because? Why yes, okay? Come on, come on, come on! - Mom, I'm not feeling well at all. - Don't worry, now we find some insulin. - How did you lose the kit I had? - It's not my fault. It is never your fault. It is your medicine. Haven't you learned to look after yourself? - Thing? - Excuse me. Sorry, let's go. Now, we find a pharmacy. Come on, let's go! - Rapid! - Do you think we'll be safe there? Force! - It's about to explode! - Easy, easy! Away, away! - Let's go in here. - It's not a pharmacy. - I know, I know, but that's all. Force! - I need a pharmacy! What are you doing here? Go away, go away! Move! I do not feel well. Over there. - You take! I have not found better. - Thank you. - Guys, look there! - Hey, grandpa! Go! What was it? Carter! Carter! Listen to me. I have to talk to you. Who is? I want to help you, Carter. What happens? Okay, we have to leave. Collect everything and follow me. - Follow me. Are you ready? - Yup. Here we go! Down, down! Come on come on! There is no more time, no oxygen. It's getting hot down here. The fire is approaching. - We ended up in the pan. - Yup. - Not in the pan, but on the stove. - What are you talking about? - Relax, everything will be fine. - No, no, no. What are you talking about? I just think when we get out of here, there will be other issues to be resolved. - Declan wanted to kill us. - Money pushes us to do bad things. Yes, but what's stopping him from finishing the job? The truth, only the truth. - We might not say anything to anyone. - Hey, listen to everyone! When we get out of here, we'll tell everyone the truth and what Declan did. Ok? - Thing? - Do you think lying will help you? The best way to keep a secret is to get rid of those who know it. All right? Ok, ok. - Received. - I'm with you. Good. Let's carry on and we'll get out of here in a moment. Here we go! Quick, hurry up! Here we go! - Turn on. - Where? - Turn on! - Where? Come on, get up! - You can't drive! - You're not capable either. So, get in! They look like the access stairs to the mine. We have to be close to the surface. Killian, try the radio. See if it works. Carter! Carter, can you hear me? Carter, try. One two Three. Carter, come in! What you are doing? - Killian? - Carter! - Do you receive me? - Killian! - Thank God, you're alive! - Yes, we're fine. We are at the old mine entrance. We are looking for a way out. Only at this point is there a signal. Where are you? I'm going to the dam. I know how to stop this! - Fire? - The seismic fire. - Is that what they call it? - We use the dam. We can empty it all and put out the fires. You have to get out of there before I clear the water. You will flood the valley and wipe out the city. No, listen. The main artery of the mine is east of the lock and leads to the river. Right? It is about 3,000 meters below the lock. Exactly. The temperature there is very high due to the fires. - Already. - Already. And a huge discharge of water can get to the river bed and in this way it will flood the mines, put out the fires and will neutralize the Helios. It is very risky. If it doesn't get to the river, the water will flood the entire city. - You have a better idea. - No. - Okay, me neither. - Listen to me well. Stay away from Declan. He blocked us below and tried to kill us. Tell her to get us out. -He just tried to shoot me. - Stay away from him. You heard me? Yes. And you be careful. Ok? Get out of the mine as fast as possible. Received. We hope well. The dam! Okay, guys. - At least, we've made contact. - Already. Well, let's continue. - So, you want to open a dam? - Yup. Nikki, what is it? Next time tell me first, mom. Mom. I would say I like it. Yes, but don't get used to it, Eve. Here we go. This is the access to the old mine. Lead to the stairs. We can get out of there! Here we go! Come on, move, everything will be fine! It feels like being in hell. It will be day very soon. We need to refuel. Going straight on that road, we will arrive at the dam. If you say so... Ok, stop. There is no current. No petrol. Let's go in. Stop! - All right. - What do you want? Just some food. Gas. OK Go. Go! Eat something. Can you activate the distributor? I don't know how to do it. There is a counter. I take a look. - Did your father teach you that? - Already. Promethean Kinetics, a chemical company implicated in the disaster, has just released a statement. She grieves over the lives she has lost but she is not responsible for the actions committed by Dr. Carter. Evidence was found of her involvement in the disaster. - Do not move! - No, wait! That's not how it went. - It was you! - Look, don't do this. We will give five million euros to anyone who finds it. I have five million good reasons to do it. - Mom, we have to leave now. - Don't go anywhere. To all units. We're looking for Dr. Carter. Caution. She could be armed. She was last seen driving a sidecar. - Throw it down! - My God! - Mom, what do you want to do? Come on let's go! - Put it down! Come on, there's a five million euro bounty on my head. I am dangerous! Put it down! - What happens? - Don't shoot! We heard shots. - What do you want to do? - Steal the police car. Hurray, mother of the year! Dr. Carter ran away from the back. - What is this noise? - But what do you care? she You die of heat. I find it hard to breathe. And what the hell is that? Get back. My God! It is more serious than expected. We have to go back. No, we can't. We don't have enough time. We have to jump. It is the only way. Great! We can do it! I'm not sure what's going on, but I think you'll go straight to jail. - You believe? - Yeah, sure. She was here. She fled when she heard you coming. - Who? Carter? - Yes, it was her. I recognized her on TV. - Can I help you, sir? - No, I'm just a curious citizen. Ok. - We can jump. - Thing? - Thing? - It's just over two meters. - We can do it. - Are you sure? - Yes, OK. Ok. - Okay. - Okay. Not bad for an old man, huh? Ok, quick. One by one. - Okay. - Goldman, you go. Come on! Unit 16, we are heading to the north side of the mountain to stop the fire and look for the survivors. Step. Who would have thought that! Dr. Eve Carter! Scientist, activist... Mom of the year! The TV is all about, Declan. You need to resolve this situation immediately! I'm working on it, don't worry. - Come on, you can do it! - Do you know in what subject I was a sucker? - Gym! - So? He is older and he made it. So, take courage! If he made it, you can too. - Are you going first? - Slater! See you on the other side, okay? Good! All right, are you there? - Come on, Goldman! - Here we go! - Shall I hold your hand? - What the fuck are you saying? I can do it! - Come on! - You'll do it! Let's go let's go! No! Help! Help me! I'm slipping! Help me! Hate! Help me, please! Don't leave me, please! God, don't leave me! Come on, we have to get out of here. I'm sorry. Ok? We are shocked. But we have to get out of here. Agree? Here we go. There are still a few kilometers to go. Look'. Verdi maybe if someone follows us? No, but I believe there is a helicopter. And I think he's following us. We need to get to the dam. We tracked Dr. Carter and her daughter aboard a stolen police car. Ms. Carter is found guilty of causing the explosions at PK plants thus causing the seismic fire that spreads throughout the country. We have Declan Glas, the CEO of PK, online. Declan, does he want to tell us what's going on? Eve Carter is a very dangerous subject. She is the only one to blame for this disaster and I will personally stop her before she can cause more irreparable damage. I have to hurry. Nikki, you stay here until the police arrive. We don't talk about it. I want to come with you. We are a team. Ok. Here we go! Be careful! Come on, run! Mom, let's go! Delta One, Delta One, take note. Dr. Carter and her daughter entered the dam. This is Delta One. We are coming to the north entrance. Received. Delta Two, I'm entering from the south side. Delta One, received. - Come on, let's move! - Come on, come on! Okay, let's try to find the control room. Already. I saw four gates when we entered and this is probably one of the... Maybe, it's here. Here we go! The show begins, guys. Arms out! Go Go go! Come on come on! Soldiers are entering the dam to capture Dr. Carter. Meanwhile, forest fires are ravaging the country. The Helios from the PK incident continues to burn threatening to destroy Prague. US President Barack Obama has sent numerous troops to aid the Czech population, but the fire continues to spread endlessly. Hurry up! - Can you use that? - Your father taught me that. They are shooting. I repeat, they are shooting! Honey, over here! I think the control room is up there. - OK let's go. - Here we go. - Are you OK? - Yup. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. Go Go! We're almost there, we're almost there! Come on, honey! Ok. Slater, you go ahead. Then, Copper and finally me. Ninth. Not this time, Killian. - I'm claustrophobic, I can't. - We just have to cross. No. Wait a moment. I see a light above the tunnel. Perhaps, there is the exit! Stay down! Wait for me there. - You have to drain the pelvis. - I have not understood. What he wants? You have to... empty the dam! We are trying to prevent it. Earthquakes are... They are caused by underground fires that need to be put out now! - How did she get in? - Do as I tell you! - It will flood the whole valley. - Not exactly. If I release the water from the dam, it will flow downstream into the earth and thus put out the fires in the mines. We have to do it now! - Madam, she's crazy. - So, what do I do? Madam, please. Open that valve, activate the power knob and lower the lever. Ok. You! Go open the valve. Go! Come on, let's get moving! Come on come on come on! Do it, mom! Carter! - Do not move! - You son of a bitch! - Won't you shoot me? - There will be a trial. A mad army will not be credible as a witness. Yes, but you won't get away with it. There will be Killian. -He died. - Are you really sure? I swear I'll shoot her in the head now! All the men in position now! I'm going. You, follow me. - Declan, don't you dare! - Now, I'll shoot her! - Don't try! - It's over, Eve! Don't touch it, let it go! - What are you waiting for, captain? - Put the gun down! - Now, Dr. Carter! - I can not do that. Listen to me! - Come on, shoot her! - No! He knows what he is doing! - Fuck! - It's all collapsing! - No! - Fire! - Force! You go! - Go! Don't lower that lever! - Tell the truth about how it went. - No, I'm not leaving you here! Mom, are you okay? Mom! I beg you! Tell... Carter I love her! - It worked? - I do not know. The water is putting out the fire! Yup! Let's get out of here, come on! Take her out. - I want to stay with her. - I love you! Me too! This is the blog of truth. I never really knew the woman who brought me into the world. She left when I was very small. In all these years I have looked for every reason to hate her and I thought that this was enough to know her. - Mum mum! - Everything will be fine! They wanted to give her 20 years in prison! She will be fine! I thought we could never make up for lost time. Let's take it all and go, guys. But two technicians survived the seismic fire and told everyone what really happened. Thousands of people died, but Eve managed to save just as many. She is considered a heroine in the Czech Republic. Declan's death ended the investigation. Perhaps, we will never find out why he did all this. The country is moving forward and being reborn, just like me and Eve. FROM NIKI AND EVE HEALTHY CHOICE Good evening, welcome to Nikki and Eve. Have you booked for two? - Yes. - Follow me. This is your table. Eve has received important job offers. I get a ticket back to California. But we, on the other hand, have chosen to stay together. We have faced a lot of things in the last few months but the reality is that we have to make up for a lifetime. - So, would you like to order? - Turkey. Turkey is good, but the veggie stew is a blast. Mom? - Turkey be it! - Okay. What are you doing? I write on the blog. And what are you doing? Now, we are a family, just like Dad wanted. I have learned to leave the past behind and accept it for what it is. She is my heroine. She is my mom. Dad, wherever you are, I know you are watching us from up there. We love you!
