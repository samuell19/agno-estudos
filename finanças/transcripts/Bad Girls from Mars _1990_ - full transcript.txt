LET ME SEE THIS. [GASPS] IS IT... ORTELLI? WE THINK SO. WELL, IF EVERYBODY'S JUST GONNA STAND AROUND, WHY DON'T WE SHOOT A QUICK SCENE OR SOMETHING? THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE SETBACK, MAC. ORTELLI. SON OF A BITCH HAS TO HAVE HIS HAND IN EVERYTHING. [RIM SHOT] THIS CAME JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO. WELL, IF IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE RECORD CLUBS, WE'LL BE SEEING A NEW PIECE OF ORTELLI EVERY MONTH. NOW WHERE'S THE GRAND WAAZU OR WHATEVER HE IS, AND WHY DON'T WE GET THAT SCENE IN THE CAN AT LEAST? HE QUIT. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ALL THE TROUPERS THAT USED TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS? YA KNOW, I MADE A MOVIE ONCE CALLED SWAMP LIST, AND THE LEADING LADY IN THAT PICTURE HAD TO JUMP INTO REAL QUICKSAND AND SHE DID IT LIKE THAT WITHOUT BATTING AN EYELASH. TODAY, YOU CAN'T EVEN GET AN ACTOR TO JUMP IN A SWIMMING POOL UNLESS IT'S HEATED. I REMEMBER THAT GIRL. THEY NEVER DID FIND HER BODY. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? MY NAME IS ALLEN. I'M WITH THE POLICE. HEY. EVER DONE ANY ACTING? IN HIGH SCHOOL, I TOOK A DRAMA CLASS. GREAT! A VETERAN! YOU'LL BE TERRIFIC. GET HIS COSTUME. [LAUGHS] JUST BE YOURSELF, AND EVERYTHING'LL WORK OUT JUST FINE. YEAH, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID TO YOUR MOTHER THE NIGHT OF YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAY. OH, JESUS H. CHRIST. HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? IT'S MY BUSINESS TO KNOW. NOW WE ARE ON SCHEDULE. I LOVE THIS BUSINESS! THE CHALLENGES, THE PRESSURES... THE MONEY. YOU THINK I DID BAT GIRLS FROM MARS FOR THE MONEY? NO. LOBSTERMEN FROM MARS I DID FOR THE MONEY. THIS YOU ARE DOING BECAUSE YOU LOVE THE BUSINESS. THAT'S RIGHT. WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT? DON'T TELL ME I'M A SUSPECT. HEY, EVERYBODY HERE IS A SUSPECT, INCLUDING ME. [PRESSES ONE KEY] [PRESSES ANOTHER KEY] [TYPES] [TYPES] [TYPES] SH... "DEAR MOM." [TELEPHONE RINGS] BOX OFFICE SPECTACULARS. [INDISTINCT BABBLE] OH, IT'S YOU. WELL, I TOLD YOU YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LISTENED TO HIM. WELL, THEN IN THE SECOND PLACE, YOU SHOULD HAVE HUNG UP. RIGHT, UH-HUH. HEY, CAN YOU HANG ON A MINUTE? NO, I HEAR MY MOTHER CALLING. YOU IDIOT. MOTHER NATURE. BE RIGHT BACK. [BREATHING HEAVILY] OUR LOVE WAS MEANT TO SPAN THE GALAXIES. NOT EVEN A SUPERNOVA CAN ERASE WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU. GOOD. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? OH, WELL, NOW YOU SEE, HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GRAB MY CROTCH, YOU SEE. THIS IS ONLY A REHEARSAL. YEAH, BUT IT WOULD HELP ME, YOU KNOW, SORT OF GET INSIDE THE CHARACTER. YOURS OR MINE? THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD. OK, I'M BACK. YEAH, SOMEBODY JUST LEFT THIS NOTE ON MY DESK. "EVERYONE YOU KNOW WILL DIE UNLESS WE SEE THINGS THE SAME"? ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T LEAVE THIS NOTE? THE THING ABOUT THIS PICTURE IS IT'S GOTTA MOVE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? MM-HMM. NOW, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOU STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF MAKING MONEY IF THIS PICTURE DOESN'T GET MADE, RIGHT? WELL, I'LL TELL YA ONE THING: IF YOU AND ME WAS TALKING LIKE THIS IN ONE OF MY MOVIES, THE SCENE WOULD NEVER FLY. TOOK YA LONG ENOUGH. SEE, PEOPLE JUST WON'T SIT FOR IT, 2 PEOPLE YAPPIN' AWAY. YA GOTTA GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE AN EXPLOSION OR A CAR CRASH. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT, THEN YOU GIVE THEM A LITTLE T&A. WELL, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MONEY WAS A BETTER MOTIVATION FOR MURDER THAN JEALOUSY. WHAT ABOUT ORTELLI? HE HAD MORE REASON THAN ME. HE'S THE ONE THAT SOLD 250% OF THIS PICTURE, NOT ME. YEAH, BUT HE'S DEAD NOW. SO WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT'S YOUR MOTIVE? [TALKS WITH MOUTH FULL] Both: YOU'RE KIDDING! OK, LET'S SHOOT THIS THING! I THOUGHT WE WERE SHOOTING THAT SCENE WITH TERRY. WELL, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU THOUGHT THAT. THAT'S NOT WHAT I TOLD YOU WE WERE DOING. WELL, I DON'T THINK I EVEN KNOW MY MOTIVATION FOR THIS SCENE YET. $30 A DAY AND LUNCH. OH, HA HA! OK, PLACES, EVERYBODY! WELL, NOW--NOW, BUT WE'RE GONNA REHEARSE, AREN'T WE? WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LIE THERE. REMEMBER, YOU ARE UNCONSCIOUS IN THIS SCENE. SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW? WELL, I'D LIKE A REHEARSAL. HEY, HEY, HONEY, NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM AT ALL. WE'RE GONNA ROLL ON THIS, GARY. HOLD ON. WASN'T HE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOT WITH AN INTERGALACTIC RAY GUN? NO, NO, NO. THAT COMES IN THE SCENE LATER WHEN THE... WAIT A MINUTE. I THINK HE'S RIGHT, ISN'T HE, BURT? YEAH, HE IS. RIGHT. WELL, YEAH, HIS RIGHT ARM IS SUPPOSED TO BE BLEEDING. ABSOLUTELY. OK, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE ANY BLOOD, SO, RICHARD YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO-- WELL, YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO LIE ON THAT SIDE, OK? BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A VERY GOOD POSITION ON MY FACE FROM THERE, YOU KNOW. WELL, WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO BRAVE IT OUT. OK, IS EVERYBODY READY?! WELL, THIS IS A REHEARSAL, ISN'T IT? THIS WHOLE FILM'S A REHEARSAL. YES, BUT PLAY IT FOR EVERYTHING IT'S WORTH. PRETEND IT'S A TAKE AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST GONNA ROLL A LITTLE BIT OF FILM THROUGH THE CAMERA TO MAKE IT SEEM MORE AUTHENTIC, OK? EVERYBODY--RICHARD, PLEASE MOVE JUST A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT. NOW YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE MY FACE AT ALL IF I DO THAT! EMANUELLE? OK, ALLEN, I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE. OK, READY AND... [WHISPERS] Roll the camera. OK, TURNOVER. ACTION! TODD... [GRUNTS] HE'S ALIVE. NOT FOR LONG. OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL HIM. TEELA, WHAT DOES THIS EARTH MAN MEAN TO YOU? HE'S JUST A SOURCE OF INFORMATION, THAT'S ALL. MONGO MONO HAS SUCKED HIM DRY. EVERYTHING HE KNOWS IS IN OUR BRAIN BANKS. HE'S ABSOLUTELY USELESS TO US NOW. I COULD HAVE TOLD 'EM THAT. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, PLAN 9 WAS A BUST SO WE'RE GOING DIRECTLY TO PLAN 18. BUT IF THIS IS TRUE, HE'S A VALUABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. Al: THAT'S NOT WHAT I'VE DECIDED. BUT EVEN YOU CAN MAKE MISTAKES, AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. T.J.: CUT! [EXHALES] SO HOW'D IT LOOK FOR YOU? FOR MY MONEY IT'S THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN IN THE SHOW. YOU DON'T THINK IT PLAYED A LITTLE TOO SLOW? NO, JUST THE RIGHT RHYTHM. EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT. T.J., ARE YOU SURE I LOOKED ALL RIGHT? NEVER BETTER, PAL. WELL, TERRIFIC. NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SET UP. LET'S GO. MAKE UP! OH, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. OH, JESUS CHRIST. IT'S GOTTA GET BETTER THAN THIS. [RHYTHMIC KNOCK] IS THIS T.J.'s OFFICE? YEAH. CAN I HELP YOU? I'M MARTINE. WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE. OH, YES! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ARRANGED MY PERSONAL APPEARANCE AT THE GAY RODEO. AWFUL LOT OF BULLDOGGING GOING ON AROUND THERE. YOU'RE TELLING ME. SO IS T.J. AROUND? RIGHT THROUGH THAT DOOR, BUT HE'S BUSY. THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE. THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED. LONG DAY? IT'S STILL GOING FOR ME. YOU WORK WAY TOO HARD AND TOO LONG. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT MARTINE SAYS. TOO HARD AND TOO LONG. UH, CAN I DO SOMETHING FOR YOU? MAYBE I CAN DO SOMETHING FOR YOU. WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE I'M PRETTY BUSY RIGHT NOW. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU DOING? I'M LOOKING AT THE SCENES WE SHOT TODAY. MMM. WELL, DON'T YOU JUST RUN THEM THROUGH A MOVIE PROJECTOR. IT WOULD BE A LOT QUICKER. EMANUELLE, THIS IS A REAL LOW-BUDGET FILM. RIGHT NOW I WANT TO REHEARSE TOMORROW'S SEX SCENES WITH YOU. [CRACKS] UH, L-LOOK, THIS ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY. I MEAN, I HAVEN'T EVEN READ THIS PART OF THE SCRIPT YET. OH, WELL, UM, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT GOES. WHAT ABOUT THE NOISE? I MEAN, MY SECRETARY, SHE'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR. HMM. WELL, I WON'T MAKE A SOUND. ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M AFRAID I WILL. [UNZIPS ZIPPER] OH, YEAH. YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT SCENE. AS A MATTER OF FACT I THINK WE SHOT THIS ONE ALREADY. AARGH! PLAYING CUTESY WITH MY BOSS, HUH? IT SEEMED LIKE SOMEBODY HAD TO. NOBODY BUT NOBODY DOES A LIP MASSAGE ON THAT GUY EXCEPT ME! WELL, IF YOU'RE SO CRAZY ABOUT HIM HOW COME YOU KNOCKED HIM OUT? BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO SEE WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU! COME ON! ARGH! AAH! YOU LITTLE TWERP! AAH! I'M GONNA FIX YOU, YOU LITTLE BRAT. AAH! KILL YOU! DON'T YOU TOUCH HIM! UNH! YOU LITTLE BRAT, I'M GONNA FIX YOU! AAH! I'M GONNA TIE YOU UP TO THE BEDPOST! AAH! COME ON, YOU BITCH! AAH! [CRACKS] AAH! OH-- OH! OHH! CANNED AGAIN. "ROSES ARE RED, MELONS ARE ROUND, "DON'T TRY LOOKING FOR EMANUELLE BECAUSE SHE'LL NEVER BE...LOCATED." [BREATHING HEAVILY] YOU'RE NOT AFRAID? NO. I COULD KILL YOU. IF YOU WANTED TO KILL ME YOU ALREADY WOULD HAVE. YOU DIDN'T KIDNAP THE OTHERS. OOH! YOU JUST KILLED THEM. I COULD NEVER KILL YOU, EMANUELLE. OH! I RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE. I'VE WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT. OH! IT'S CHANGED SOME, BUT, UH-- WAIT. HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? ♪ I'VE GOTTA BE ME ♪ T.J., WHERE'VE YOU BEEN? HEY, DICK. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING YET? NO, NO, I CALLED LIEUTENANT AL AND HE'S OUT TO LUNCH. THAT'S GOOD. AND REGAN, MAC REGAN, HA! COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF HIM. TYPICAL PRODUCER-- NEVER RETURNS ACTORS' CALLS. YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT. MAYBE HE'S THE KILLER. T.J., NOW LISTEN UP. I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUDDY. I MEAN I KNOW IT'S A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THOUGHT, BUT NOW JUST SUPPOSE THAT EMANUELLE IS, YOU KNOW-- YOU MEAN SUPPOSE SHE'S KILLED. AH! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. BUT ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, SUPPOSE, SUPPOSE... SUPPOSE SHE'S KILLED. WOULDN'T THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS MY BILLING IS CONCERNED? OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT BILLING AT A TIME LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU'RE THE MURDERER. HA! ME?! WELL, WHY NOT? MAYBE YOU'D KILL TO GET WHAT YOU WANT. OH-- HUH? NO! I DON'T THINK. THERE! GARBAGE? WHY YOU MUST BE VICTOR! VICTOR BUNTZ. YOU REMEMBERED! HOW COULD I EVER FORGET THAT AFTERNOON WE SPENT IN THE GARBAGE? BOTH OF HANDS WERE FREE THEN, OF COURSE. THINGS WERE A--A LOT LESS COMPLICATED THEN. YEAH, AND A LOT SAFER, TOO. CAREFUL! I'M VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT CERTAIN SUBJECTS. YEAH, LIKE MURDER? [RASPY BREATH] PLEASE! WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A DECADE OR MORE. DON'T RUIN THIS MOMENT. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU'RE JUST GONNA BRING A COUPLE OF GARBAGE CANS IN HERE AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? HUH! SO WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU. WELL, WHAT ELSE? EH, IT'LL DO FOR NOW. YEAH, I'M EXPECTING A CALL ANY MOMENT THAT MIGHT BREAK THIS CASE WIDE OPEN. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU 2 BOZOS WERE GETTING YOUR FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THAT NOTE THIS AFTERNOON I FIGURED THAT SCREWED UP ANY CHANCE WE EVER HAD OF LIFTING THE KILLER'S PRINTS OFF IT, BUT--HA HA! I SENT IT DOWN TO THE BOYS AT THE LAB ANYWAY. AND? THEY FOUND A COUPLE OF PRINTS ON IT MATCHED UP WITH A GUY NAMED VICTOR BUNTZ. EITHER OF YOU GUYS EVER HEAR OF THEM? NO. WHO IS HE? HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER OF A DR. EDWARD WOOD SOME TIME AGO IN SWEDEN. HEY, DON'T YOU HAVE A SPARE HAMBURGER OR ANYTHING AROUND HERE OR SOMETHING? I HAVE TO MAKE IT. MAKE IT. YOU GOT IT. [BREATHING HEAVILY] OH, IT WAS DéJà VU ALL OVER AGAIN. I KNOW. IT WAS...FANTASTIC. SORRY I HAVE TO GO SO SOON BUT I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN. WHAT, BETWEEN MURDERS? AT THE RATE YOU'RE GOING I WON'T BE SEEING MUCH OF YOU. ONE MORE AT THE STUDIO AND I'LL BE DONE. KEEP THE FIRES BURNING. AW. MEN! SO THIS BUNTZ CHARACTER COULD BE ANYBODY. THE SURGEON CHANGED HIS FACE AND THEN HE KILLS THE SURGEON, THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNEW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE. [RINGS] HELLO. YEAH. IT'S FOR YOU. HELLO. T.J., DON'T EXPECT A FIRST-RATE PERFORMANCE FROM ME TOMORROW MORNING, WHAT WITH ALL THAT'S GOING ON. I NEVER HAVE, DICK. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, SURE. JUST WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. THAT WAS THE ADDRESS OF A WAREHOUSE OWNED BY VICTOR BUNTZ. LISTEN, I HAVE A HUNCH IF WE GO THERE WE'LL FIND MS. FORTES, HUH? YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO GET HER? EH! HMM! UNH! OH, SHIT. WHERE THE HELL AM I GONNA SQUEEZE THIS-- I GOTTA CUT THIS BUDGET. RICHARD TRENT. I'LL CUT HIS PAY IN HALF. EH, HE'S TOO DUMB. HE'LL NEVER KNOW. HEH! LET'S SEE, THAT $25 TIMES 5 DAYS. $125. THAT'S IT! YEAH. [METAL WARPS] I GOT ENOUGH MATERIAL FOR 3 BOOKS NOW. HEY, MURPHY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT TUNA FISH SANDWICH THAT WAS IN THAT GLOVE COMPARTMENT? I ATE IT. I WAS HUNGRY. I HAVEN'T HAD A BREAK IN A LONG TIME. THAT WASN'T YOURS TO EAT. IT WAS IN THERE FOR MORE THAN A WEEK. I THOUGHT YOU FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. JESUS! EMANUELLE! EMANUELLE! AH, DON'T WASTE YOUR BREATH. SHE AIN'T HERE. WELL, I THOUGH YOU SAID SHE'D BE HERE. SHE WAS. CAN'T YOU SMELL THE PERFUME? I CAN, I...CAN. SOMETHING VERY... KINKY HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THIS ROOM. WELL, THEN HERE IS SHE THEN? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I CAN TAKE A PRETTY GOOD GUESS. DID YOU EVER STOP TO WONDER WHY EMANUELLE'S YOUR ONLY LEADING LADY THAT WAS KIDNAPPED, HUH? NO. NO. NEVER KEPT ME AWAKE AT NIGHT. YEAH, WELL, THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU AWAKE IS ONE OF YOUR OWN MOVIES. THAT'S FUNNY. THEY HAVE JUST THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON ME. SO WHAT IS YOUR POINT, LIEUTENANT? WELL, LISTEN, IT'S MY GUESS THAT THE KILLER IS IN LOVE WITH HER AND HE'S GONE BACK TO THE STUDIO TO KILL AGAIN, AND EMANUELLE'S GONE THERE TO STOP HIM. NOW HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT? YEAH. LET'S GO! YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO EAT HERE. LIEUTENANT? "WHEN THINGS ARE ROUGH DON'T LET IT BE SAID THAT LIKE MARTINE YOU LOST YOUR...NERVE?" UGH! OH, WELL. I NEVER LIKED HER ANYWAY. AH! ARE YOU STILL ANGRY ABOUT THAT SANDWICH? JUST DRIVE, WILL YOU? AND STEP ON IT, PLEASE. HAVE I TOLD YOU THE ONE ABOUT THE 3 PEOPLE STRANDED ON THIS ISLAND? I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. I DO. THERE WERE THESE 2 GUYS AND ONE GAL. THEY WERE STRANDED ON THIS DESERT ISLAND. IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS SHE GOT SO DISGUSTED WHAT SHE WAS DOING, SHE KILLED HERSELF. ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER, THEY GOT SO DISGUSTED WHAT THEY WERE DOING WITH HER THEY BURIED HER. AND ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER, THEY GOT DISGUSTED WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO EACH OTHER, THEY DUG HER UP AGAIN. HA! THAT'S-- THAT'S SICK. I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF CUTE MYSELF. HA HA! OH! REGAN! [WHINES] OH, NOW I'LL NEVER GET PAID. "REGAN WAS AN ASSHOLE "SO I KILLED HIM WITH APLOMB, "AND ALL THE REST WILL DIE UNLESS THE FIND MY...EXPLOSIVE." AAH! OHH! OHH! OH! HEY, I'M STARVING. LET'S STOP AT THIS AT THIS LITTLE BURGER JOINT COMING UP. WHAT, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? WE CAN'T STOP. THAT'S THE PLACE WITH THE REALLY GREAT FRIES, YEAH? WELL, IT IS. UNH! OH, LET ME GO! LET ME GO! LET ME GO OR I'LL RIP YOUR NUTS OFF! ARGH! OOF! AAH! GOD, CREEP! I'M GONNA--UNH! THAT'S IT. I'M TRYING MY KARATE ON YOU. TAKE THAT MASK OFF YOU! AAH! OW! OH, GOD, HELP!

OH, YOU BET ME. GUYS! I'LL BET YOU THAT IF I'M WRONG THEN I WILL PAY FOR EVERYTHING, OTHERWISE WE'LL PITCH IN, ALL OF US. ALL RIGHT. UNH! OH! OH! OH, LORD, HELP ME. I'M GONNA GET YOU FOR THIS. OH, JEEZ, WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY? OH! AH! DO YOU MIND? YOUR KNEE'S IN MY GROIN. OH, I'M SORRY. MYRA?! IF I'D HAVE KNOWN IT WAS YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE JUMPED YOU. NOTHING'S BEEN WORKING OUT RIGHT FOR ME LATELY. THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING OUT VERY WELL LATELY FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU EITHER. CAREFUL, THAT'S HOT. I'M SURPRISED YOU GOT IT TO GO. DON'T BITCH. IT'S BAD FOR YOUR DIGESTION. LISTEN, TURN ON THE SIREN. NOT WHILE WE'RE EATING. JUST DO IT! [SIREN] NOW THERE, YOU SATISFIED? HMM. THE ONLY MOMENT OF REAL HAPPINESS I EVER KNEW AS VICTOR BUNTZ WAS THAT AFTERNOON WITH YOU IN THE GARBAGE. I JUST WASN'T CUT OUT TO BE A GUY, YOU KNOW? I WAS LOUSY AT SPORTS, BEER MADE ME NAUSEOUS, I HATED SHAVING IN THE MORNING. SO I WENT TO THIS DOCTOR IN SWEDEN AND I CHANGED MY SEX. OK, GUYS, GIVE ME A SLICE. YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M HUNGRY. OH, UN-UN-UN-UN-UH! YOU'RE THE ONE THAT DIDN'T WANT TO STOP, REMEMBER? COME ON, BUT THE DAMAGE IS DONE. YOU DIDN'T WANT TO CHIP IN. OK, HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU? AW, GIVE HIM A SLICE. OH, NO! HE HAS BEEN SULKING LIKE A CHILD. LET HIM GO ON SULKING. SUIT YOURSELF. OH, FOR CHRIST SAKES. I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A MOVIE STAR. YOU KNOW, BRIGHT LIGHTS, FLASHY CARS, GLAMOUR, THE ENQUIRER. NOW LOOK AT ME. WHY ALL THE MURDERS? IT STARTED WITH DR. EDWARD WOOD. I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT MY POOL AND MANSION IN BEVERLY HILLS WHEN SUDDENLY I SAW THE DOCTOR STANDING THERE WITH SOME BEFORE-AND-AFTER PHOTOS OF ME IN HIS HAND AND I REALIZED HE COULD DESTROY ME, SO I SAVED HIM THE DISGRACE OF BECOMING A BLACKMAILER. BY KILLING HIM? I COULDN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER WAY, FOR ALL THE GOOD IT'S DONE ME. I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THE RIGHT PERSON TO KILL TO GET INTO MOVIES. SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE GIVING UP. ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAW HOW WELL YOU WERE DOING FOR YOURSELF, BUT YOU COULDN'T CRACK THE MOVIES EITHER, SO I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU A HAND. YOU WERE THE ONE WHO GOT ME THIS PART? IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY. I ASSUMED YOU'D BE SCARED OFF THIS MOVIE, BUT ONCE YOU WERE IN HOLLYWOOD THINGS WOULD START HAPPENING FOR YOU. COULDN'T YOU HAVE JUST SCARED THE OTHERS OFF? DID YOU HAVE TO KILL 'EM? I COULDN'T STAND TO WATCH THEM WITH RICHARD. I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH FOR THAT. AND AFTER ALL THIS, YOU'RE GONNA CHUCK IT ALL AND BOMB THE PLACE? HAND GRENADE. I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO MAKE A BOMB. YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING YOU'D UNDERSTAND ABOUT ALL OF THIS, BUT I CAN SEE THAT YOU DON'T. SO NOW YOU HAVE TO KILL ME, TOO. PLEASE, LET'S NOT SPOIL OUR LAST FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER. [SIREN] OK, I'M SORRY. I ACTED LIKE A JERK BEFORE. IT'S OK. HE ONLY WANTS A PIZZA. AH, HERE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. HEY, YOU GUYS ATE IT ALL! LISTEN, HOW SORRY ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ARE YOU SORRY ENOUGH TO BUY US ALL A DRINK OR 2 UP HERE AT KELLY'S PUB? IT'S COMING UP. HEY, HEY, THEY GOT A WAITRESS IN THERE GOT A SET OF TITS YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M GONNA STAND AROUND WAITING FOR YOU TO BUMP ME OFF? OH, GOOD THINKING. I HAVEN'T LEFT MUCH TO CHANCE. [BATTLE STATIONS ALARM] [SIREN] EMANUELLE! EMANUELLE! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HEY, WE HAULED ASS GETTING HERE! LOOK! [ALARM CLOCK RINGING] I'LL GO BACK TO MY PLANET AND TELL EVERYBODY OF EARTH THAT YOU WANT OUR PLANETS TO BE HARMONIOUS. YOU KNOW? HE SAID EXHAUST INSTEAD OF EXALTED, AND HE DROPPED A COUPLE OF LINES. WHAT DOES IT MATTER? MMM. TEELA, TEELA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [SAW BLADE WOBBLING] T.J.: CUT! WILL THIS MOVIE NEVER END? CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT
