Alright! Nice! Game. Game. Game. Party! Boss. Boss. - Girl, there's a cute guy on the other table! - Super! I agree with you, girl! Where is it? Hey, Jasmine. Don't throw up here. I'm not throwing up. I'm just looking for my earrings. Oh, your earrings. Are you sure you dropped it here? This is the reason why I don't want to get drunk. The last time, it was my cellphone, and then, at Tessa's party, remember, I lost my wallet? I just don't know why your stomach doesn't get used to alcohols. Here it is! Found it! Thank God. - Why do we have to drink whenever we go out? - You know what? It's better to lose a wallet or a cellphone than to lose a husband. You're crazy. You know what? Among all your earrings, that's my favorite. I shouldn’t use this. It might get lost. Come on. Hurry. I wanna dance already. Aren't we going home yet? Where's Bullet? He said he'll just get you a drink. Come on. Let's dance. Okay, you go ahead. I'll be right here. I'll just wait for Bullet. Wow. This place is so great. Really? Well, DJ's booth is over there. - Where? - There. We're home now. I always want to see you wear this. It's so beautiful! - Thank you. - Wait. Wait. I got a story. I'm on a business trip. I'm already leaving. First class. Here's the story. The airplane won't take off because I thought the person beside is having a heart attack. So I called the F.A. "Come here! Come here!“ So she helped him because he's old, right? When he stood up, he farted! Dude, we're here. Wait. I'm not done yet. Give it a rest, Bullet. - See you tomorrow? - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. - Reunion. - See you there! - Bye! - Let's go. Let's go. Wait a minute. Why are you so hot-tempered? What did I do? You were flirting with that woman. - You thought I didn't see you? - Hon, it's my job to flirt with other people. I own a bar! It's my job to hit on the customers. While I'm around? How do you think that makes me feel? Hon, I don't know the reason why you get insecure. Right? I mean you're the sexiest. You're the most beautiful -- I'm not being insecure. I only need you to respect me! You want to be extra friendly? Extra sweet? Extra nice? Fine! Just make sure it doesn't make me look stupid! Why do you have to blow things out of proportions again?! Mommy! Daddy! Chiefy_ Chiefy, why are you still up? - Are you fighting again? - No. No, baby. Why were you shouting? He's right! You know, Chiefy___ Mommy just has a really loud voice. Especially when she's jealous. Babe? Sh"t. Babe! Why is it so smoky? Why did it burn? What do you think?! You left the pan! The oven takes a while to heat up so I brushed my teeth first. What time is it? I'm late. Come on, babe! Babe, please don't get mad. Don't worry. Next time, I'll just call for a delivery. Okay? Did you hear? Evy has broken up. Evy? You wouldn't know her, dear. She's our friend back in LS. days. You know what's more shocking? Mark is having an affair with Evy's sister. My God. Do you think Bullet is having an affair? What? Nothing. Just forget it. You know, I wouldn't be surprised because Bullet meets a lot of girls at his bar. Oh My. But it doesn't mean he's womanizing. He doesn't have the reason to do that. Dear, you are such a sentimental. You know what? I was like that for five years. I trusted my husband too much and then I found out, he's already banging all our maids. Banging? Yeah. I learned that from my gay hairdresser who loves to get banged. You know where? - Tessa! - Yeah! See? My God. Giselle, what's in your bag? These are the giveaways from work. Want some? It must be fun for you being a med rep. Because you have a lot of freebies all the time! Well, I have to go. I'm sure my lawyers are waiting for me. Why? What's going on with your annulment? As usual, still annoying. I'll see you next week, okay? Bye. Bye. Did you just gain weight? You'll get used to her. She's really sweet. On My... If we will get along, it would've been long ago. Wait a minute. Why do you think Bullet's cheating on you? I don't know. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just bored at home that's why I think about too many things. Anyway, what's this? Open it. You said that's your favorite among all my earrings. Jasmine. Don't refuse. I insist. This is too much. Come on. I want you to have it. Or else, I'll sulk. There. Looks better on you. Thank you. What is it? Nothing. Because even... even my husband can't buy me something like this. I'm so glad you liked it. -6,000 for you. Three gives. - So expensive! Can you make it 2,500? You bargain too much! You have to be patient if you're stingy This one's good! Smells good. Really? How much is that? Not now. I'm still paying for the bag I got from you. My husband and I might fight again. Come on! That'll end next month. - Take it. Celebrities love that. - She's right! - Good morning! - Hello. Regarding your activity, it's now fixed. - Hi, doc. - Giselle, I was just looking for you. - Do you have a minute? - Yes. Okay. Okay. Later. Later. Later! Please! - Wait a minute. - Bye! Babe, let's go. We're getting late. Wait a minute! So... Wow! My wife looks beautiful! You bought another one for installment? - What? - That one. Your earrings. Jasmine gave it to me. We already talked about this. I told you we need to save money. I need to pay for a lot of things! I still haven't paid half of the capital I borrowed from Bullet! I just told you Jasmine gave this to me. If you want, you can ask her later. She just gave you a wallet! And yet you still took another gift! Aaron, what can I do if she's generous? What's wrong with that? You know how I save up for myself, right? Would I refuse a little gift from other people? Where are they? They said they're coming. You still see Bullet? Of course! We're just in one condo. Actually, I rent one of his unit. Nobody can take you apart. They're here. We arrived in time. - Oh, hi. - Bullet's wife is really gorgeous. Jasmine, what took you so long? - My husband's so slow. - See you around. See you later. Hi! Oh, hi. How are you? This is Bullet, my husband. Babes, wait. Does that woman has the same dress as mine? Where? That one. The one Jasmine's talking with. My God. That must be original. - I just got this at Greenhill; - Babe, relax. No one notices it. Oh My God. This is embarrassing. - Let's go, babe. Let's go home. - What? Do you want me to get embarrassed?! They just arrived. The program hasn't started yet. Fine. You can stay if you want. I'll take the taxi. Wait! Babe! Hi. Sorry. Did I wake you up? I know it's late but I just worry about Giselle. Is she okay? She's taking a rest now. Sorry if we just left earlier without telling you guys. That's nothing. Giselle texted me she suddenly got dizzy. Don't we have to take her to the hospital? No need. She's fine now. Maybe she just got tired at work. - Where's Bullet? - I let him go upstairs. He's drunk. Of course. You missed a lot. Here. I got you a souvenir. - Hey, thanks. - Okay. Tell her I dropped by. - I'll see her tomorrow. - Okay, I'll tell her. - Babe, what did she say? - I'm not in the mood. Babe. Babe, please. Babe. I'm sorry. I don't have one of this kind yet. Look at it. It has many stones. They all look the same to me. Why do you look so tense? Can you relax? I know! Let's go to the spa later, okay? Mommy, did Daddy have another woman before? - Miss, can you excuse us? - Okay. Why? Did you hear about anything? Nothing. I'm just curious. We've never talked about these things. Do you and Bullet have a problem? Once or twice. I had suspicions. Actually, that's not true. Until now, I still have suspicions. But I don't investigate. What for? To get hurt? It's fine with you that he's cheating on you? Not necessarily cheating on me. I know he loves me. The problem is... he just love doing it so I let him play. But it's unfair for you. Who says I'm fair to him? Whose money do I spend every week to buy these jewelries? Beron, what is it? Hello, ma'am. It's Tommy. - Why? What happened to Tommy? - Ma'am_ it's Take-Dad-to-school day today. I know that. What's the problem? Sir isn't here. Tommy's the only one who doesn't have his daddy here. I reminded him earlier about that. Maybe he's just running late. Don't worry. I'll call him. - Let me talk to Tommy. - Your mommy will talk to you. - That's your mommy! - I don't want! Tommy? - Take care of it. - Okay, sir. Bro, what's up with this? It over heated again! That's why I brought it here right away. Good thing, we're just around. Excuse me. This is Charlene, bro. Charlene, this is Aaron, my best friend. - Hello. Where's the restroom? - Hi. - Restroom. - Restroom? There. Straight ahead. - We'll just be here. We'll be here. - Okay. What? What?! You're crazy. You think dirty, you know that? Come on! She's just my staff in my restaurant. We just picked up some supplies. Supplies! Speaking of! Look, it's your wife. Tell her I'm not here. Bro, tell her I'm not here. I thought she's your staff. Just tell her I'm not here. I'm not here. Hello. Hi, Jasmine. I'm just taking my chances, would you know where's Bullet? I've been calling him. But I think his cellphone's off. I don't know. There's an event at Tommy's school today. He promised he's coming. But Beron said, he's not there yet. Is that it? Maybe he's just running late. Don't worry. I'll text Arthur. I think they're together. - Thank you. - Okay, no problem. - Dude, your son... - Sh"t. Tommy! Sh*I. I forgot all about it. Daddy! Daddy! He's not home yet. Go back to sleep. Oh My. Sir, you just got home? What's in it for you? Just go. Go. Beron, I get this. - Wake Tommy up so he can come down here. - Okay. You should have a good excuse. Why do you have to forget Tommy's school event? Hon, I was taking care of a lot of things. What are you taking care of, Bullet? The bar? Your co-owners are the ones taking care of that. You can even just call it your hobby. Hon, come on. Hobby? Come on. Don't I get serious with anything? Do you really want me to answer that? We now have a child and yet you still think less mature than Tommy. That's why you're his favorite. He thinks of you as his playmate. Bullet, I don't need another child in this house. So what do you want? To be morose like you? Morose? Hon, you're always just so proper. Everything you do is planned. Come on! You weren't like that before. Remember how we actually used to have fun? What happened? I became your wife and the mother to your child! Who locked me up in this house? You don't want me to get a job, right? You want me to just think of you and our son! That's why sorry, Sorry if I became morose. Bullet. I don't expect you to be in love with me everyday, but I hope... I hope the days where you don't love me that much, - I can still feel respected. - When did I ever lose respect for you? The moment you get yourself another woman. What? Why? isn't it true? What the?! What the?! Who's poisoning your mind?! Who?! I just know it, Bullet. So you're a psychic now, huh? Stop lying to me! You can call me morose but I'm not stupid! Can we just stop this bullshit! This?! This is bullshit! Hi, babe. Why are you late? And you, why are you still up? What is that? What? The one you're holding, what is that? Giveaways, why? Then why are taking that inside the room? You usually just put it there. There's no space here so I'll just put it there. - There's still space for that. - No. - No. No. I'll do it. - Give me that. Wait. I said give me that! Is this the giveaways? How much is this? That's for installment. Giselle, we have to sacrifice! We'll be buried in debt with what you're doing! Why are you always blaming me?! We're buried in debt because of your useless business! Don't throw it back to me! Why not?! Aaron, what do you really want to do with your life?! You finished as a doctor but you don't want to take the board exam! My God! You even joined pyramiding! Yes! I may be a money spender but you live in a luxurious life! Because you gamble our own life! I do everything for us to have a better life but I just don't have the luck! And while you're waiting for luck, what do you want me to do?! Save my money from spending?! Let myself look like a maid in front of your rich friends?! Is that what you want?! Aaron, I'm beautiful... smart... Yes, I don't know how to cook, But sh*t! I'm good in bed! Dammit. I'm worth it and I deserve better. Gi. Are you okay? It's nothing. You had a Tight. Do you want to get some drink? I don't know. Sometimes I just really don't have a foresight. I knew we would Tight over it but I still did it. I don't think about the consequences of my actions. Why do you always have to think about the consequences? Life would be boring. Just relax. If you want, let's just dance. - Excuse me, sir. Here it is. - Here it is! This is it. If this won't satisfy you, I don't know what else to do. - What is that? - This? This is the single most expensive scotch whisky you can ever ind. How expensive is that? Two thousand dollars? Around two thousand dollars. - Take it inside. I'll just sign. - Yes, sir. Well, I'm sorry. I can't afford that. Would I let you pay? - Why? - I got it for you. Why? Don't you think you deserve it? So you're smoking. Does Aaron know that? Does he have to know everything? You know what? Sometimes I wonder what would my life be if I'm now in the U_S_ Of course... Aaron will follow you. Right? I know him. He'll fight for you. He loves you. We really weren't supposed to get married. But he panicked when he found out that Mommy's petition for me was approved. I have a theory. Now, you have theories. What's that theory you have? Well, I have this feeling that Aaron married me because he doesn't want to get outshined by you. Come on. What? What did you just say? Are you serious? - Well... - What are you talking about? You are his idol. Me? Well, I guess, he sees in you the man he aspires to be. What does Aaron aspire from me? What? Being an as"'hole? Getting myself all over the place. What? Maybe because... you're fun to be with. What were we thinking? Aaron? - Babe. - Hello. I already called lots of people. Where are you? At the office. The whole night? I just had to take time. Babe, I'm sorry. Let's not fight any more. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just forget about that. Just come home. Okay? Okay. I bought you you're favorite dessert. I love you. Look at this place. We should really get out of town more often. You're right. So our meetings for our prayer group would be fun. But is Pastor Eddie really coming? This is not his thing. He doesn't have a choice. I let my driver fetch him. Here are the barbecues. What's the most delicious one here? Everything's delicious. Go! Make more barbecues! You know what? I still can't believe you cooked all of these, Tessa. Jasmine, anybody can cook. That's what Chef Rob. That's why I think everybody here should enroll in his class because someday, we might make our own restaurant. Pastor Eddie! See? He's here already. Hi. Giselle, are you okay? What? You've been quiet. I'm just thinking about my work. Don't mind it. It's a weekend and yet you're getting yourself stressed. Try to enjoy, okay? Yeah. And He said to him, "You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment and the second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments, depend all the law and the proits_“ What do you think is the message of those words? Gi. About what happened, Bullet, not here. Wait. Did you get my earrings? Giselle! Hi! Where's Aaron? He's getting the things in the room. Oh, okay. Didn't you like what I prepared? You didn't eat that much. - No, it's not- it's not- - Maybe... you're sick. You look weird. Or it must be the dress. Okay, bye. Tommy. Why don't you play in your room? It's already messy here. Hon, did you have my clothes pressed? Bullet, Tommy's here. Why? He's a boy. Come on. What if the maid suddenly comes in? Beron?! Hon, I just have to say this, she's quiet but she's real gay. She made moves with all the girls downstairs. Hon, favor. Please charge my cellphone. The chargers in the cabinet. Let me do it. - Get it there. - You're going to take a bath just now? - We'll get late. - I'll be quick. Go. Go. Hello! Yoohoo! - Hello! - Tommy don't play with that. Hello? Good afternoon, ma'am. This is the Pavilion Hotel calling. We've been trying to locate Mr. Bullet Bernal. Apparently, the number he gave us was incorrect. Fortunately, his credit card company provided us some information. This is his wife. What is this all about? Oh, then we have good news for you, ma'am. We have your earrings. Earrings? Yes, ma'am. The pair of earrings you left in the room you stayed in with Mr. Bernal? Those are yours, right? Pastor, try the soup. Get more. That one's delicious. Thank you. - Where are they? - Just eat. - Bullet! - What? Where's Jasmine? Where's Jasmine? I thought she's already here. That's why I hurried myself. What? Aaron, can I borrow your cellphone? Why? Where's your cellphone? Damn. My cellphone's with Jasmine. Why? I'll just call. You know what? I won't be surprise if they had a fight again. Delicious! Pastor, this is a replacement for your Jurassic laptop. Hey, thank you. See? it's so nice! Here's Jas! Jas! Where have you been?! Jas! Hon. Why? Is there anything wrong? - Oh, My Gosh! - Jas! You didn't even get contented with the jewelry I gave you. You're going to steal even my husband? Wait a minute. What's happening here? Babe, I'll explain everything. Why? Didn't you know? Your wife and my husband -banged each other. - Please. Not here. I treated you as a friend. I trusted you. I have suspected lots of women as Bullet's other woman, and yet, it's just you? Dude. Is this true? I'm so sorry. - Damn you! - Boys, that's enough! Wait! Get off me! - Jasmine! - Where are you going?! Damn you! Traitor! - Let me go! - That's enough! Traitor! Aaron, stop it! Babe. Babe? Babe. Babe. Babe, please! Babe! Babe! Babe! - Daddy! - Jasmine! Wait! Wait! - Daddy! - Jasmine! Wait! Wait! - Son. My son, this will be ixed_ Wait. - Daddy! - My son, we will ix this, okay? - Daddy! - Jasmine, we can talk about this! - Daddy! Jasmine, please! - Son, wait! Wait. Jasmine, please! - Leave us alone! - Daddy! Daddy! - You'll never going to see us ever! No! My son, we can fix this, okay?! Trust me, we can ix this! Jasmine! - Boss, have you seen my wife and son? - Sir. I don't know. - Mommy! - Jasmine, please! I'll run into you if you don't step aside. I said, get out there! Daddy! Daddy! Jasmine? Tommy? Tommy. Tommy?! Tommy! Tommy! Hey you! Look what you did to my car! This is my family! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Jasmine, open the door! You really have nothing to worry about. The contusions are shallow. And the X-ray results are normal. You can take them home after a while. - Doc, are you sure? - Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. Because of my stupidity, I almost lost both of you. I can't take it. I know it's not easy to forgive what I did. Please. Please. Give me one more chance. I can change. I will change. Because I love you so much. I was getting worried. You've been missing several sessions. I thought you're not coming back. You look tired. Is everything okay, Giselle? Sorry, sister. I'm a bit busy at work. I got promoted that's why I have more responsibility now. Wow. Congratulations! So how do you feel about her promotion, Aaron? As long as she's at home by 8 PM., sister. But are you happy that she got promoted? It's okay to me, sister. I'm just curious, Aaron. Until when are you going to give your wife a curfew? Chief. Chief! Chief! Wait! Wait! Wait! Can you please take care? - Daddy, I'm thirsty. - You might fall down. - Thirsty. There. - Yes. - There you go! - Thank you, daddy. Hon, let's have a bonding time in Boracay next week. Is that okay with you? Just the two if us. Isn't the car here yet? I want to rest. The car? Wait. Wait. - Daddy. - Wait, son. I'm just talking to Noli_ Hello, Noli_ Where are you? We're already here in front. What is this stuff? Can you please take this out? Don't you like it, babe? Whatever you put in this place, it will still be ugly. Why do we have a disconnection notice from the cable? You haven't even paid for the electricity I just got my salary. I'll just pay for that later. Aren't you going to eat? No need. I have a meeting in Makati. I have to be early. I'll go now. Hey. Make sure you're really going to a meeting. Yes. Are you crazy? Now that your relationship is fine, that's when you want to get separated. It's useless, Tessa. I know he's trying his best but I don't feel anything towards him any more. If you really think about it, marriage should have an expiration. I mean, a marriage Contact is just like any other legal contract. So why does it have to be a lifetime commitment? Why not a subject for renewal every five years? Ma'am, is this what you're looking for? Yes. Perfect. Go. Go to the counter. Will follow. Go. Go. Go. Go. Jasmine, it's because you need to give yourself time. It's not easy to forgive. It's a long painful process. Don't you think your marriage is worth saving? What about you? Jasmine, three of my maids became my husband's other women. And now, I found out, we have the same doctor for derma_ Do you really think that kind of marriage is worth saving? And besides, annulment is horror. I wouldn't even wish it on my worst enemy. - Bye, Giselle. - Hi. Giselle, we're going to a karaoke bar. Wanna come? Sorry, I can't_ Come on. You always don't come. By the way, do you know a near place where I can buy roasted chicken? Roasted chicken? What for? I'll go now. Forget it. - Let's go now. - Okay. What time is it? Didn't I tell you the car got busted? I left the car in the hotel. The car broke down at 6 'o clock. It's because it's hard to get a taxi. Here. I bought you some food. The thing I hated the most, is when someone is lying to me! I'm not lying. And I'm late for only 10 minutes. You're still late! We have an agreement, right?! Are you fooling me around?! - No. I'm not fooling you around. - No? You have already fooled me once! I already talked with my partners in Cebu. They said, the bar in Cebu is gonna be twice as big as the one in Makati. I told them, I don't want to go to Cebu. But they were insisting I should've done the groundbreaking. So I thought, why not go with me? No. Tessa and I are taking care of something at the shop. Hon, come on. Cebu is fun. Just you and me. Come on. Go with me. Aren't you going to light that up? This one? Hon, come on. I told you, I quit. I'm just playing this around. Okay, hon. Let's do this instead. I'll leave you with a few numbers. If you need something, if you want to ask me something, -just call me. - No need. Hon, I need it. I just want you to trust me again. I have to go. Mommy's waiting for me. Why do you need to go to Baguio? It's a trade launch. I can't miss it. You can't_ What the? But babe, that's a big account. Even the president of the company is going to attend. Babe, I have to be competitive. So if I'm going to be promoted, we won't be short in money. Are you trying to prove you're the only one working here? - No. - You might be forgetting, if you only became a good wife, I should still have a job. But now what? I was cheated upon and yet, I can't even pay for the capital that as"hole gave to me! Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe, please. I'm begging you. If you want, you can call my supervisor to prove to you that I'm telling the truth. Hello? Jasmine? Yes, who's this? It's Aaron. Good thing, you haven't changed your number. Hello? Jasmine? I'm here. Sorry, I wasn't expecting your call. Am I bothering you? What's this about? I just want to ask something. Is Bullet leaving Manila next week? He's going to Cebu next weekend. Why do you ask? Cebu? Not Baguio? That's what I know. Why do you ask? Giselle! Get up! Babe, what are you doing?! You're hurting me! Tell me the truth. Are you going to see Bullet? What? Maybe you're just making the trade launch in Baguio an excuse so you can go to Bullet in Cebu. You've already talked to my supervisor, right? What kind of proof do you want?! I don't even know if you both have a connivance_ My God. You're getting paranoid. - I'm talking to you! - What the?! - I'm talking to you! - Let me go! Go on! Just kill me! Until when are you going to suspect me?! I'm doing everything for you to trust me again! What else do I have to do?! What else?! What else do I have to do?! Just stay here. You're not going anywhere. Aaron? I didn't know this place is yours. It's mine and Tessa's. I was convinced to study culinary. I liked it. So here. Now, we made it our business. Good thing, Bullet allowed you to work. Whatever you tell him before... Before. He's not the only one who's being followed now. And you, what are you busy doing this time? Reviewing. You'll continue becoming a doctor? I thought it's against your will since that's just what your parents want. While I'm not doing anything this time. Why did you close the auto repair shop all of a sudden? Do you still wonder if they still see each other? What? When you suddenly called me. Is that because you're suspecting that they're still having an affair? I just can't stop myself from thinking about things. Don't you ind it difficult? - Wait. Wait. - Mommy, daddy, here's my work! - First place? - Wow! You're the best! You're the best, Chief! - Picture! Picture! - Congratulations! I'm so proud of you, baby. Mommy, don't call me baby. It's embarrassing. Sorry. - Excuse me. Bullet? - So nice. - Oh, My God! Hi! - Mommy, that's a star. It's me, Roxanne. I used to work at ECI. - Yes, of course, Roxanne. - Hello. How are you? I'm okay. I'm good. Here's my card. Just in case you need anything. Okay. Thanks. - How are you doing? - I'm good. I'm good. - I'm fine. - Really? That's great. - And you? - Oh, I'm okay. I thought I'm numb. I don't want this any more, Aaron. Jasmine. I don't want to get hurt any more, Aaron. I don't want... Wait a minute. Where are you? Sorry for the drama earlier. I don't know what got into me. I guess I just panicked. It's so difficult, right? We love them... but we're also mad at them. Guilty in heat. Guilty in cold. (Damned if you do, damned if you don't) But what can we do? A heart can easily be compromised. But the mind, it doesn't forget easily. what's that? The oven's timer. The breads. Just wait. Aaron, have a taste while it's still hot. I'm leaving already. Aaron, thank you for listening. That's nothing. It happens to me too. I suddenly get mad or to much suspicion. If that happens again, just call. Okay. Wait. Take home some of these. Today, I heard my favorite song on the radio I closed my eyes and saw our first hello And then I saw the time we fell in love in each others arms I opened up my eyes and you were gone. Suddenly, I realized howl love you so and how I can't survive without your love 'cause every time you say goodbye, it's hard for me to say how I wish you'd never go away Don't say goodbye, it's hard to let you go Tomorrow seems so far away for me to know if you and I will always be in love forevermore Don't leave me with just memories all alone All alone Aaron? What are you doing here? I have a meeting earlier just near here. So I thought of stopping by. And... you haven't called for a while. Didn't I tell you? Tessa and I went to a culinary seminar. We're in L.A. for two weeks. I just got back home yesterday. Oh. Do you want to have some snack first? Maybe next time. And I'm going to a meeting. By the way, here's the book I told you about that helped me. You might want to read it. Thank you. You look good. I'll go ahead. Bye. Honey Honey, it's already late. Why did you let him sleep there? He's been playing. Who's that? Hello? Hello, Jasmine. Is everything okay? Hon, who's that? It's Tessa. I really have to talk to you. Okay. I'll be there in 30 minutes. You're going to meet with her? Hon, she's pitiful. She's crying. She's having problems with her annulment proceedings. I'll stay with her. Don't mind her. Look at the time. Don't mind Tessa. She needs me. Go to sleep. Aaron? What happened? Did you have a fight with Giselle? Let's just talk inside. Do you want coffee? I'll make one for you. Babe, I'll just wait for you outside. Babe, I have a strategic planning tomorrow. I might stay late but I'll be home before 10 PM. You don't need to tell me. What? I understand that you have more work now and you also have more responsibilities. And you can't stop yourself from getting home late. Are you serious? You're lifting my curfew? Does this mean you're trusting me again? I kind of feel hungry. Where do you want to eat? He had enjoyed seeing the bears that day. But was glad all was calm again. And they lived happily ever after. - Go to sleep now. - Okay, chief. Go to sleep. - We're done. - Daddy, you should kiss mommy too. Mommy, kiss daddy too. Go to sleep. Go on. Ready yourself to bed. Promise me, you and daddy won't fight any more, okay? Son, come here. Listen to daddy, okay? Come here. I know mommy and daddy always fight. But son, not any more, okay? It won't happen again. Even mommy and daddy make mistakes. But son, a promise is a promise. We will always be together. Just like a fairytale, right? We will have our own happily ever after. It's Tessa. Why did you call? Let's meet up again tomorrow. Aaron... Jasmine, you're the only one in my mind. That's why I need to see you again. Tomorrow, outside the coffee shop. I'll wait for you. Please, Jasmine. Looks like you're really into jogging now. It just became a habit. Where do you jog? Why do you have to take the car? Just there. Is that where you buy all of these? We haven't eaten lots of these. It's just a waste. Okay. I'll just take a bath. You know, I'm really trying to consider on expanding our business next year. We'll expand this early. We still have to renovate our interior inside -- - You should really learn - - I don't know what's up with her. Okay. Okay. Yes. Go on. Take it inside. We have to talk about something. - What? - O kay. What are you talking about? We have to finish many things for the catering. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, My God. It's Giselle. Tessa, let's go. What? What are you doing? Wait. Hey. Let's order that. I just want to check out the place. I can't understand why are you the one hiding? You're not the one who did something wrong. - This isn't right. Let's just go back. - Tessa, please. Let's stay here for a while. My dear, lovers, other woman, and mistresses are the ones who should hide, not the real wives. Especially the friends of the real wife and co-owner of the coffee shop! Jasmine, what's really going on? A few months ago, I saw Aaron there. And then now, you're scared of facing Giselle all of a sudden. I'm not scared. Oh, My God. Don't tell me... Jasmine, was there an earthquake? Please tell me because it seems like the world went upside down! Tessa, please, don't tell anyone. You're getting a revenge against Bullet? Is that it? No, Then what?! Don't tell me you're in love with Aaron! I don't know. It just happened. What? It just happened. My God, Jasmine, you sound just like my ex-husband. That's exactly what he said when I asked him why he did it with our maids. It just happened. Well... congratulations, my dear. You're now officially a certified home Wrecker. Don't you think she's already having suspicions? It was just a coincidence. You even said, she just went to eat. And she's even with her officemates I think we should stop seeing each other first. Don't you like it any more? Aaron... Not because we want it, means we should continue with it. If this is where we're happy, Aren't we thinking? My husband and your wife already did this. We know how hurtful this is for them. They're the ones who started it. Jasmine... I know this will cause trouble but I r:can’t stop myself. I can't get away from you. Tommy? Yes, baby. I'm on my way. Just wait for me, okay? I'm so stupid! Why? I volunteered to fetch Tommy in school because the nanny's sick. Where's the keys?! What will I do? Just go back here for the car later. I'll drive you there. My car's just right there. I'll just take the taxi. You'll take longer. Look... I'll just drop you off. I'll leave right away. Not here. Move the oar forward. It'll be far for you. Somebody might see us. Please. When I get down, leave right away. Come on! Relax. - Bullet? - Hey. What are you doing here? Tommy called me. Where have you been? Why are you late? There's too many people at the shop. I wasn't able to leave right away. Mommy! Daddy! Baby, I'm so sorry I'm late. What's that you're hiding at the your back? It's nothing, mommy. Bakugan again? Didn't I tell you, don't waste your money for this! It's cheap. Even though. We have an agreement. Hey. Take it easy with the kid. You're the one late. He's right. That's why he gets spoiled. Tommy wants upstairs but let's eat first. We thought that's it. But it's not. I told you not to stay late at the pool. You'll get colds with what you're doing. I'm strong, mommy! - Come. Let's change your clothes. - Wait, mommy, my toy. Mommy, that's Tito Aaron we saw at the mall earlier, right? You still remember him? They're living here at this condo then. He's the one who dropped you off to school, right? What? I saw him, mommy. He's the one driving. He drove you off. Tommy, I didn't see you until your daddy arrived. You're making up things again. Mommy, I'm not making up things. What I'm saying is true. I was there. I saw you and 'llto Aaron. Tommy, that's your mommy, right? Oh My! She might see me here! He waved at you? Yes, mommy. Tommy, don't make stories. It's bad to lie. But what I'm saying is true, mommy. - I saw you and 'llto Aaron. - No! It's true! it's Tito Aaron! I saw you together! Tommy! You're making me mad! Stop this nonsense, okay?! I don't want you to tell this to your daddy. Do you understand? I'll spank you if you do that. Babe? I think I'm ready. Ready? I want to have a baby with you. Well, I remember you're the one asking me to make a baby. That time, I still have a lot of hang ups. Now, I'm so excited to build our own family. Babe, you're right. We really have to be prepared and to save money if we're going to have a child. Especially now that I have no work. What are we going to spend for the baby? It's up to you. Can you handle both your career and the baby? And besides, we're both young. We're not in a hurry, right? Yes. - This one? - There. Thanks. Jasmine, are you free on Saturday afternoon? Because there's this food magazine that wants us to get featured in an article. I have to go. Hey. Where are you going? it's still early. We're going out. What's up? It's our 8th month. Just like highschool? You really celebrate monthsary? Okay, fine. You just be careful, okay? Go. Are you still far? 15 minutes. Oh, okay. See you! See you. - Hello. - Tommy saw you. What? Where? When you drove me to school. He saw you. He said you put the window down and you smiled at him. I smiled at him? He said you waved at him too. Did you purposely let him see you? Why would I do that?! That's the same thing I want to know. Maybe he was just imagining it. How will he able to see you when your car is heavily tinted? I don't know. Maybe I just put the window down and fixed the side mirror. Look. I don't exactly remember. But if it really happened, I didn't mean it. What are you thinking? I don't know what else to think. Do you want us to get caught? So my husband and your wife will leave us? Or you want them to ind out what we're doing. So that they'll get hurt. So you will have your revenge. Is that what you think of me? Maybe I'm just getting paranoid. I'm really having a hard time with what we're doing, Aaron. Just get here, and we'll just talk here. Is that okay? I'm here. Hello. - Aaron. - I thought you're near. Bullet's here. If I didn't see him, he could've followed me there. Wait a minute. Where are you? I'm coming for you. It's over, Aaron. What?! We knew this has an end, right? Go back to your wife. I'll go back to my family. Hi, girls. - Is Doc already there? - Not here yet. Giselle, we've been going to this coffee shop before, right? Look. One thing people love in there is their bread pandesal_ My husband's been going here. Looks like their food are really delicious! Babe, dinner time! *The subscriber cannot be reached -please try again later. - Babe, dinner time! Wait! *The subscriber - Babe! *The subscriber cannot be - Babe, time to eat! Yes! Wait! Sh*t. - Babe! Babe, come on. Let's eat! - Coming! Wait. What's up? Huh? Nothing. Why? Should there always be an occasion? I just want to cook all your favorite food. There's something missing. Oh, the shrimp paste! Imagine before, I can't even fry an egg. Come on, eat. - Your sweat's dripping into the food! - Oh, sorry. Here. Eat. Here. Come on, eat. I lost my appetite. But... I prepared all of these for you. Did I ask for these? I thought you'll be happy. How will I be happy when you're wasting a lot of money?! That's too many! How are we going to finish that?! Are you thinking?! Sorry. Don't get mad. What food do you want? You might want something else -- Are you deaf? Or what I'm saying isn't getting into your head?! I already said I'm not hungry! Most especially I hate it when you waste money! Do I have to say it over and over?! Wow! Wow! Just call me later. I have visitors here! - Hey! Wait! What's that? What's that? - Here are the gifts! - Mine! Mine! - Hey! Wait! Of course! You know what?! You look fresh! Looks like you enjoyed in Japan! - More like a second honeymoon! - That's right! - Looks like Tommy will have a new sibling! - Ma'am, food is ready! - Good! I'm famished_ Let's go. Let's eat! Let's eat! - Yes! 'lime to eat! - Alright. Let's go eat! No diet today! I'm outside. I'll go in if you don't face me. Who texted? I just forgot something in the car. I'll just get it. Okay. Okay. I'll go ahead. - Bullet, where's Jasmine? - She's outside getting something from the car. - I'll be just be in the kitchen. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. - Get some more. How did you know I'm here? I followed you. Are you looking for trouble? Stop bothering me! Jasmine, I'm going crazy thinking about you. Leave. Bullet might see you. Jasmine! Dude. How are you? What's happening here? You really have no idea. None. Jasmine has been talking to me. She wants us to be okay. She feels sorry for the friendship we had. She even reminded me how long we've been besl'friends_ Okay, I admit it's hard to forget everything that happened. But Jasmine's right. If God can forgive, what more if it's me. Friends? Come here. Hon... Are you okay? I'm just happy you're finally okay. Bullet, we're about to start. I thought you already stopped smoking. You know what? I thought Aaron and I won't be okay any more. How about Giselle? Have you talked? One step at a time. There's___ There's just something I can't understand. Bullet. What? You were saying? Me? Is there? You're going out again? Where are you going? I need to be at the shop early. We have a catering at lunch. I thought you're not coming. Aaron, let's end this. But what I'm saying is true, mommy. I saw you and 'llto Aaron. No! It's true! That's Tito Aaron! I saw you together! Where are you going? I have to be early at the shop. Bullet! No! Bullet! - That's enough! - Stop, Aaron! - Stop! - Please stop! That's enough! - Stop, Aaron! - That's enough! Now what?! You think I'm not going to fire?! Bullet. I'm begging you. Put down the gun. Did you intend to do this? Did you intend to do this... ...to hurt us? No. What about you?! Did you plan for this?! You did this to us before, right?! Aaron, we were drunk that night. It just happened once. It never happened again. How long? - That's not important. -It's important to me! How long have you been seeing each other?! Eight months. Now what?! What else do you want to know! How often we do it?! You didn't do anything to my wife that I didn't do to your wife! And it didn't happen once. We did it over and over and over! Now what? Does it hurt? Now you can feel the damn thing you did to me before! Do you also want to know where we do it? Enough. - At the restroom. - Enough. - At the top of the table, at the floor! - That's enough! - At exactly where you're standing! - Enough! - And even at the car. - That's enough! Bullet. Please, I'm begging. Just think of Tommy. It doesn't matter if we get broken, just not our son's life, please. How did you last for 8 months? Obviously, that's not only sex. Do you love her? I don't know. - Where are you going?! - Let me go! Let me go! As"hole! Let me go! I said stay! You're not going anywhere! As"hole! Give me that! - Wait! Where are you going?! - What do you want?! Tell me! Do I have any reason to stay?! - You must understand me! - Why?! Because I was the one who cheated first?! Haven't I paid for that? I would've walked on bended knee just for you to forgive me. I'm tired, Aaron. I'm tired! You can't use one mistake I've done for you to hurt me over and over. Bullet. Don't ever give your passport to your daddy. Why don't you keep his passport too? You know him. He's messy. Mommy, when are we going to take a vacation with daddy? Maybe one of these days. Jasmine! I'm so sorry. The traffic is a horror. Sorry. Bullet, the airplane might leave you again. Please. Tommy's classes will start next week. You know what? This is what I miss from your mommy. Bullet, I'm serious. I'm serious. You don't have to worry. We'll be back here on time. That's a promise. And I'll bring a gill for you. Peace. Go on. You might get late. If only you're not a snob, I would've courted you again. - Today, I read your letters and - Go on. - Waiting for you call. - Bye. I wondered if you think of me at all - Again, I turned the radio on. - Just keep him sedated, okay? - Refer him to Dr. Morris while I'm out. - And heard our favorite song. - Besides he knows the history of the patients - Then I knew you'd soon be coming home Don't' say goodbye. it's hard to let you go. Tomorrow seems so far away for me to know - If you and I will always be - Babe. - In love forevermore - Why did you bring that? - I told you to wait for me. - No, it's not heavy anyway. Babe, request them to have our seats near the lavatory. Okay. Sure. I want to go to the bathroom again. Just a minute, okay? When I get down, leave right away. Come on. Relax. Don't say goodbye, it's hard to let you go. Tomorrow seems so far away for me to know if you and I will always be in love forevermore. Don't leave me with just memories all alone. All alone Today, I heard my favorite song on the radio I closed my eyes and saw our first hello. And then I saw the time we feel in love in each other's arms. I opened up my eyes and you were gone. Suddenly I realized how I love you so and how I can't survive without your love. 'Cause every time you say goodbye it's for me to say How I wish you'd never go away. Don't say goodbye, it's hard to let you go. Tomorrow seems so far away for me to know if you and I will always be in love forevermore. Don't leave me with just memories all alone. All alone
