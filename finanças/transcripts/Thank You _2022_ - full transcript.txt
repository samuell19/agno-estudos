Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Morning, Priya. I have a presentation with Latin American investors. Need to prepare... Leaving early. I'll meet you in the office. [mobile ringing] Priya, how are you? Aunty, are you going to the hospital? Yeah, I'm getting ready. Tell me. -I need to meet you once. -Why don't you come then? Let's meet somewhere on the way, aunty. -On the way... -Is 4th Avenue coffee shop OK you? -Okay, I'll see you there. -Okay, bye. Priya wants to meet. I'm going. Okay... See you in the evening. Priya! Sorry, Priya. Horrible traffic. Tell me. What happened? I'm pregnant now. Priya! Congratulations. Good good. I get it. I already told you... How long will you be in live-in? I told you to get married. Did you tell Abhi about it? Okay... I'll go get some coffee. Let's relax and talk. Okay? It's been many years since it all started. A snowy early morning. Outside an airport... The day I saw Abhi for the first time. The moment that changed my entire life. It's as clear as it just happened. Sailaja aunty and Rao uncle are almost like our family. To receive students from India who come through uncle's consultancy... I too used to go to the airport. -Priya... -The flight landed a long back... -Abhi is still not here. -He'll be there, look for him. He's new to America, right? He'll be excited by everything. -Look for him. I'll be there. -Okay, uncle. What are you doing in the carousel, like you are kid?! Since I was a kid, I loved snow and carousels. And the combination excited me. -Sir... -What's this? -Did you come from India like this? -No, sir. Without a jacket? Hello... The temperatures will be in minus here. Stand like this for half an hour... You can forget the consultancy and... ...can go admit in a hospital directly. Come come come. Get inside. Fast fast. Abhi mailed us from India, saying that flying to America is his dream. So Rao uncle helped Abhi get a visa. The curiosity in his eyes... The wound to his hand... I don't know why... I wanted to know more about him. Is this your first foreign trip? It's my first time even getting on a flight. Never crossed Andhra border. I grew up in Narayanapuram. And then moved to Vizag. Are you a student or an employee in Rao sir's consultancy? -No, actually-- -She can also be my daughter, right? She's like my daughter. Family friend. She keeps helping me with things. Sir, about the balance 4 lakhs... Once I get a job, I'll pay you in instalments. Your target is bagging a job. Not the money you have to pay me. Abhi, I hope you know the process. Your visa will be expired in the next 6 months. I'll setup 8 interviews by then. You'll have to crack one of them. -So stay focused. -Okay, sir. Okay. -For your expenses. -It's Okay, sir... Keep it, Abhi.. I used to keep meeting him with some random reason. Time used to fly in peace when I'm with him. I used to share everything with him. But he used to keep some secret from me. I only know that he has no one. But he never revealed anything about his past, friends, or college. That mysterious nature got me close to him. He developed an innovative app. I saw how hard Abhi worked to make his dream come true. Here, use this instead. This is a medical field related app. If we get wounded by accident... If we click a picture of that wound, the app will X-Ray it. It will analyse that X-Ray through artificial intelligence... With in minutes, we'll get every information about that wound. What doctor to consult... What kind of medical help to get... And this... This is a chemically coated paper. Just a drop of our blood onto this paper... It will react with the chemicals and form a unique pattern. One photo of that pattern... The app analyses that pattern and gives a complete blood picture with in minutes. Your thyroid, lipid profile, vitamin levels, cholesterol... Every single information... To put it simply, it's a mini diagnostic centre. And the app's name is Vaidhya. It's a fantastic idea, Abhi! Why to come to the US if you already have dreams like these? You would have done this in Ameerpet itself. First of all, you should settle in a job and then in life. Then you can experiment with these apps. Don't miss the next interview. I arranged a meeting with some investors my father knew. -They liked the app idea. -That sounds good. They asked Abhi to develop it. He asked uncle for coders under his consultancy, but uncle did not agree. What if they don't like it once the app gets developed? Huh? Be practical. I told you that he won't agree to this. He's scared that he'll lose his commission if they send them with me. -I can't believe him. -Abhi your father would've done the same. Why to take risk instead of having a safe job. What now? You have to hire some coders, right? Yeah. How much will it cost? A minimum of 10,000 to 15,000 dollars, Priya! -I don't have that kind of money. I... -I'll give you that amount. I'll give it. He hired coders, developed the app successfully... And presented it to the investors. They loved it. And released the funding amount. He came to me right away. That day... Hi, Abhi... ... no words. Come in.It was so beautiful. -You came here to give me the cheque? -Priya... I wouldn't have done all this if you wouldn't have helped me. I don't want to give you back this money. For this whole life... I want to stay owed to you. Lifelong, Priya! "This very moment... I've forgot my own self." "My heart followed you like your shadow." "I've become you a long back." "Me, my time, and my energy... It's all yours." "Walk with me and it's bright all around." "The little time I saw you felt like a dream." "I want only one name on my lips." "I'm all your from now on." Everything went so fast from then on. The app is getting successful. We started living-in. A dream life with Abhi. My dream... The best years of my life. "Looking into your eyes..." "I'll just keep walking by your side." "This very moment..." He used to be busy... But he always had time for me. I don't know when and where it started... But I saw Abhi change over time. Maybe because of the money, success, or fame... I don't know. He started thinking he's the center of everything. I felt like a new Abhi replaced the Abhi I love. Yeah we are planning to expand. -Take Vaidhya globally... -Abhi... An interview! Of course, yes. We all started together. A photo? Photo... [voices muted] Sir, four of us are working in this company for the last 5 years. 6% hike for us like the rest of the employees is really less. -Hmm! -I think we deserve better. Do you own a car 5 years back? No, sir. -And now? -Yes, sir. Own car... Sufficient bank balance... Even your kids go to a premium school, right? Yes, sir. Your car, house, and your clothes... Even your underwear was be provided by me. All of you are not doing something I can't do. You only do what I say. You are all like this disposable bottle for me. Work if you want to or get the hell out of here. I will decide what you deserve. Got it? "I wanted to tell you so many little things." "Come sit with me for at least once." "I wanted to share all this little nothings with you." "What's with all this distance?" What are those, ma'am? If pride takes over a man... They say, 'He've grown a couple of horns'. That's right. [voice muted] Priya... Let's get married. Where and when is your decision. Beach, cruise, destination wedding... It's up to you. -Idiot! -Sorry... I'm sorry. -What the hell is wrong with you? -I'm extremely sorry sir. You can't even serve a simple cup of coffee properly? I am sorry sir. Do we even need to get married? At least for the formality of it. If it's just for formality, let's not. -Sure?-From that day on... Our relationship changed from love to formality. "I've been chasing my dreams from the minute I get out of bed." "I've been pushing myself all day." "I'm the moon and sun to my own skies." "I'm the one man army in my own war." Okay! Have it. TODAY Okay... When are you telling Abhi? I don't even know if I should tell him or not, aunty. Why so? Once I used to feel happy and safe with him. Now I'm scared of him. As a gynic, I meet a lot of parents. After kids, the guys change a lot. They'll get matured. They'll be more responsible. I'm not saying this as a doctor. I'm saying this, taking the position of your mom. Give Abhi a chance to change. I have only two ways to choose from. To get back the old Abhiram. Or to leave this Abhiram. I'm so confused about it, and... I got pregnant. [voice muted] Rao uncle... What brings you here? How are you? I'm good. But what brought you here so suddenly? You didn't even call me... -What happened? -As if you have no idea! Our visas will be expired in the next 6 days. None of us have attended even one single interview. Sit at home if you don't know how to run a consultancy. -What the... -Wait... Pratap! Don't be tensed. You have 6 more days, right? What will you get from making a scene? Then what else! Should we hit you and then talk? -No Pratap. -You never cared about our future. You'll lose nothing. And we'll lose everything. What are you even talking about? He took a bank loan to do this for you guys. Do you know that? Hey... I don't care about all that. We should get jobs in 6 days. Or else... Let's see what you can do. Next time you come in... Better behave yourself. Sir... The pressure is rising from all sides. I know this is not the right time for this. But we are getting continuous calls from the bank, sir. And if you don't pay back the amount... -They are saying they will send notices... -I'll handle it. You go. Are you fine, sir? Hi, Sreedhar... How are you? A small request. Nothing, a few... I failed to place jobs for 60 to 80 guys over here. If you don't mind... If you can absorb them into your company, it will help me. At least 10 of them... [voice muted] [voice muted] Abhi is my last hope. Can I get 2 minutes of his time? Sure, uncle. -I'll go tell him. -Okay. -Abhi... -I have a meeting in half an hour. -I need to leave now. -Abhi... Rao uncle is here. Which Rao uncle? How many Roa uncle's do you know in the US? What does he want? Regarding some placements. Bloody parasites! They don't even believe that you'll be successfully. And once you are, they'll come searching for you. I don't have time for this, Priya. Ask him to leave. Send him away. That's in the past. Do you need to do this right now? -Just talk to him once. -I'm not a hypocrite, Priya. I can't forget everything that he did and act. No, that's not me. -I don't have time for this... -Abhi... Keep it low. He might hear you. Let him... I don't care. At least for my sake... Meet him once. For you, for someone else, or for anyone... I won't compromise. Ask him to get the hell out of here. Priya, the meeting with Latin American investors was a success. Next week, we'll be meeting the Middle East investors. We'll be set if they'll also step in. Vaidhya will reach 75% of the world population. Everyone will know the name 'Abhiram' now. Priya, I reached my 4 year goal. What happened? Where are you going? I'm going away from you... Far away! What happened to you, Priya? I wanted to tell you from a long time... And now, I took a decision. What? The way you behaved with Rao uncle... You know how much I've always cared for him... And how much I loved him. He came to meet you with a problem over his head... But you don't even have time to meet him and talk. You don't have any conscience, Abhi! You know what? A man without conscience is as good as dead. Priya! Why are you being so emotional for nothing? You've changed so much that you see nothing, Abhi. You've become self-centric and arrogant! There's no place in your life for anyone, except you. To me or our... You know what? I'm done. Priya... Are you really fighting with me for Rao? [mobile ringing] Huh? I would have missed my meeting if I met him like you said. Above all, you know how important that meeting is to you. I'm thinking about Vaidhya's growth. And you think about that small consultancy! Priya, I'm talking to you. Listen to me. Priya. What? Roa uncle died. What? Sudden cardiac arrest. It's you who broke his heart, Abhi! Mine too. Priya... Priya... Priya? No... Not because of me! -Hello! -Abhi. Yeah, sir. -Got the news? -Yeah. Terrible! So shocking. He's the man who gave me, Abhiram. The feedback he gave me about you still reverberate in my ears. And that's why we made the deal. Rao sir is the reason that we are making so much profit through Vaidhya today. -Wow! To the last decibel... -Yeah. I must say it's great. It's working. -Congratulations, Abhi. -Thank you so much, sir. -Abhi, would you just wait? -Yeah, sure... sure... Sure. Really? In fact, I didn't believe in his app once. Oh my god! It's his persistent hard work... And uncompromising nature. I saw no man with them till date. I'm really proud of him... And you can happily go ahead. I'll be surety. Even I'm feeling so much of pain... I can understand what you are going through. Take care, Abhi... Sorry for your loss. Which Rao uncle? How many Roa uncle's do you know in the US? Bloody parasites! Ask him to get the hell out of here. Roa sir is the reason that we are making so much profit through Vaidhya today. You've changed so much that you see nothing, Abhi. There's no place in your life for anyone, except you. Bloody parasites! Ask him to get the hell out of here. You've become self centric and arrogant. You don't have any conscience, Abhi! You know what? A man without conscience is as good as dead. Everyone is saying that you don't have a conscience... I'm here to remind you that you do have a conscience. I'm your conscience. Hi, Abhiram! Your pride, ego, arrogance, You've kept all these inside you and you are cheating yourself... I felt suffocated and came out... Are you thinking why now? Why not earlier? After many days, I saw a small hope in life. You are struggling within yourself. And for the first time, you are feeling guilty about Rao sir. What guilt? Huh! What guilt! I'm not the reason for his death. Then why are you not being able to go visit his family? I'm the reason behind Vaidhya's success. I'm a self made man. You keep saying this all the time. But when you came to know that Rao sir's words did all this for you... You felt guilty that you couldn't do anything for a man like him. I never knew that he did all this for me. And he never would have. That's not his character too. Why do you think Priya left you? Because I didn't meet with Rao. Not because you didn't meet him. But because Priya can't find the Abhiram she fell in love with. Success got to your head. And you are racing forward without looking back... But for the first time in your life, you stopped. Look back, Abhi. Not just Priya and Rao uncle... There are a lot of people who are reasons for your success. Wait a minute. Other than Priya and Rao... There are more people responsible for my success? I'm telling you again... I'm the only reason for my success. I'm the only god dam reason for my success! What if I remind you of all those people? I'll do whatever you say. Who are they? Huh! Who? You say that you have no one, right? But you do. Not here... Back in India. August 15th... 2003. Narayanapuram... Boat race... Parvathi... NARAYANAPURAM On the name of our beloved freedom fighter, late Narayana Rao... Like every year, Narayanapuram got ready for the boat race, once again. Cricket was born in England, and it never bagged a world cup. Like wise, Narayanapuram never won these races from the last 48 years. The whole village is waiting for that one man, who can break that record. Idiot, move aside... I can't see anything. Let's get into the race details. The yellow flag belongs to Dhavaleswaram Vasu. Kotipalli Srinu is here with a white flag. And with the shining red flag... Our very own... Abhiram! Clap for him... Also... Korrelu Anand... Rajolu Gopi... And Kommuri Suresh! -Stop staring angry! -The boats shouldn't dash each other. -No foul language. -Come here, you moron! I'll smash your head! Who asked you to enter my name? Is this hockey to just win? Who asked you to win? They'll pay 500 per boat, just for participation. Our Prince's movie is about to be released next week. Remember that. We need money for the tickets and the celebrations, right? That is why I did what I did. Everyone here knows that our village will never win. Dude... What? -A girl! -Where? In the car... She's going in the car. [crackers bursting] [crowd applauding] Seems like he'll win! With the blessings of our Holy Mother... After 48 years... Narayanapuram finally won the boat race... [victory percussions] Hey... Stop... We've been walking back with our heads hung low from the last 48 years. You saved the name of our village, and the pride of my grandfather. Who among you is the hero? Who won the race? What! You? You are still a boy! You might have made the others feel really small. I thought of sharing something with the winner. But you are just a kid. Rajeshwari... Take this. What are you waiting for? Come on... Come! Do you remember that day? That aroma from the land lord's kitchen... Until then, we thought that mom is the best cook in the world. But only then we understood that there are better cooks than her were in there. Come... Come to me. You saved our pride. Parvathi, bring that cup. I'm cooking, dad... Give me two minutes. You can cook later. Bring the cup first. You give it to him. Go on. Careful! What's your dad's name? Vishwanadh, sir. Station master. Oh! He passed away, right? So he's your father. Where's your mother. There she is. -Namasthe, sir. -Namasthe. I can't express my happiness in words. Is your son getting educated? Yeah, in your grandfather's college, sir. -Is it! Are you doing good? -Yes, sir. Yes yes. He's really good, sir. He had always scored nothing less that the first rank. Just like his father, he too loves hockey, sir. Well done! From now on, not just the college... His education will also be my responsibility. [hailing Narayana Rao] -Hey... -I'll take leave, sir. Take this. Give him a big round of applause all of Mother! [hailing Abhiram] -You made this? -Yes. Paru... You cooked really well. -What did you call me? -Paru. Paru... Sounds nice. Everyone calls me Parvathi. It's the Holy Mother's name, right? -But you call me Paru. -Okay, Paru. -Even your mom cooked so well. -I'll tell her that. Bye, Paru. "What's this! What's happening to me?" "How can we even be together?" "The way you look at me, why does it change?" "Where are we headed? What's with this magic?" "Why do I want to see you, again and again...?" To whom are you making all these, so early in the morning? For me. Who else? No, you leave! "Every breeze that touches you..." "It touches me first. What else can I say." "I wanted to gift you something..." "But you do that even before I get a chance to." "I want to wait for you..." "But you are always there for me." What's this? I'll teach you from now on. -Okay...? Sure? -Okay, Abhi. "What's this! What's happening to me?" "How can we even be together?" "The way you look at me, why does it change?" "Where are we headed? What's with this magic?" -Abhi... Come here... -Yeah, mom. You like it, right? Paru... -Paru... -Abhi, you played really well. My dad played for the railways and wanted to make it to the Indian team. But it didn't happen. I'll make his dream come true. I'll bag a job in the railways and play for the Indian team. That's my dream. -Mom, my friend Paru. -The landlord's daughter! -She'll cook for us today. -Please sit. Enough! Tastes great! -Is that your dad? -Yeah, that's my dad. It's his hockey stick. Take a look at it. When I was a kid, I wrote 'All the best, dad' for him. I use this stick now. And it feels like my dad says all the best to me. My lucky stick. For me, there's nothing more valuable than this in this entire world. "This is going smooth and well..." "Look close, there's a lot to it." "It made my heart so heavy..." "I want your help to deal with it." "Your name is like a spell to me..." "I have no idea why!" "It's like a holy chant..." "That I need to sing everyday!" Paru, you cook so well even without learning how to. Imagine how well you can cook if you learn cooking. Also, they'll teach all kinds of cuisines here. Indian, Italian, Chinese, continental... You can roam the entire world. Paru, there is some magic in your hands. Your talent shouldn't stop here. I don't have a photo for the application. Thank you! A course to cook? We don't need all that, silly! "A beauty that no one can see..." "Your friendship showed it to me." "It made me forget my dad's anger too..." "And replaced it with happiness." OKKADU "You've got me so high in love..." "My heart just went out for you." -What else did you cook? -Fish, dad. Oh... Your favourite. -Have some samba. -Yeah, go on. Hey, are you still a kid or what? Can't you remove the thorns yourself? She don't have the habit. She might get hurt... What will you do after she gets married? Every time she cooks fish... I'll go feed her myself. -Great! -Eat... This is clean. Eat... -Water. -God, I forgot. -I'll go get some. -Go on. Abhi, what are you doing here? Did you climb off the wall? How can you just show up like this? Mom and dad are here. Let's meet tomorrow, Okay? Paru... Mom and me are leaving the village tomorrow. What for? Don't... Don't you know? About what, Abhi? Your dad came to know about us. Sir... Do you know what's the most important thing to me in my life? My daughter. She's my life! I will do anything and everything for her well-being. He warned mom that he'll kill us if we don't leave. You have 24 hours... Never show your faces to me, ever again. Parvathi, what's taking you so long? Coming, mom. If you want to stay back in the name of love... River Godavari is really vast and huge... No, sir! Paru... I wanted to ask you this for a long time now. Do you love me? No, not like that... Do you love me, with all your heart? I do. Your dad spent most of his last days in this room. This room is bringing back all those memories. I'll stay here for a while. -Okay, mom. I'll take care of the luggage. -Okay. -Madam, come in. -Sir... Abhi... Abhi... Abhi! Paru... Paru... Paru... Paru, wait I'm coming. -I... I thought you won't be coming. -Why did you think so? I told you that I'll be coming, right? Dad will send his men once he finds me missing. -Careful. -They'll come directly to the station... And we'll get caught. That's why I started a little late. Sit here, Paru. I'll go get the luggage. Sit. -Will the train be here on time? -It will. What's the plan? Where are we going to? Your dad will search all the surrounding villages for you. We can't stay anywhere for long. We have to keep moving for the next 5 to 6 months. We should do that for at least a year... But Abhi... Let's get settled in Vizag in the end. Huge city... Well populated. Dad can't find us there. There are also very good colleges there. How can you think of college at this point of time, Paru? Why did you say that? You have to join a college after one year, right? We are eloping, Paru... I don't even know what tomorrow brings for us. Also, if I got to college, who will take care of you and mom? Abhi, if you don't study... How can you get a job? What about hockey? I'll get some other work, Paru. Abhi, what about your dream? Your promise to your dad? Will everything happen as per our plan? Huh! Did you ever think that we'll be eloping like this? You never did, right? You have to give up a few things to get a few things, Paru. Paru... What happened, Paru? Do you love me? Yes. No, not like that... Do you love me, with all your heart? I do, Paru. Then leave me behind. What are you talking about, Paru! Why are you compromising? Huh? All this is just for me, right? But, Abhi... A guy like you should never compromise. Boys of your age won't even be thinking about tomorrow. But you... You have clear plans for the next ten years... That is what made me like you in the first place. The Abhi I love and came all this way for, [station bell ringing] [train honking] How can I come any further, when I knew that Abhi won't be the same anymore? If you ever feel that I'm the reason for you to give up on hockey? [brakes squeaking] I can't take that kind of pain. Abhi...! If you really love me... Promise me this... The way I'm compromising about you right now... Promise me that you will never compromise, about anything. Promise me that. Abhi? Abhi? [train honking] Abhi, what's this! I'm just here to say my goodbye. That's it. -Mom, you get in. Go on. -Okay. I don't mind if you think I did something wrong, Abhi. But one day... You'll realize that I did the right thing. I believe in that. She left me in the last minute, just because I have no money with me... How can she be the reason for my success? Huh? What was your age back then? 18 years. What if Paru came along with you that day? You would have struggled really hard to take care of Paru and your mom. You wouldn't have completed your education too. How could you even make it to America without a proper degree? And forget about starting your company 'Vaidhya'. Rather than a love that sticks... A love that leaves you free is more valuable. Paru gave you such kind of love. Paru didn't leave you because you had no money with you. But not to force you to compromise on your dreams. The most important decision of your life... Paru took it for you that day. She stopped then and there... So that you could reach here. For you to realize that yourself... You have to go meet Paru now. Now? Whatever it is... You will have to start it right now. Go... Hi, welcome to my YouTube channel, Parvathi Vantalu. [voice muted] Paru... Paru... Abhi! Abhi... Didn't you recognize me? You've changed a lot. Glasses... Gray hair... I didn't recognize you at all. It's been 17 years, Paru. But you still look the same. -How are you doing? -I'm very good. How are you? Good. What brings you here? Just wanted to see you. I thought you don't even remember me. [singing an old Telugu romantic song] -Karthik... - [continues to sing] My friend Abhiram is here. -Hi! -Hi... Abhiram. Nice meeting you. -I'll go get some coffee. -Sure. -Just to help in my free time. -Oh, that's nice. I'm not free all the time... I have my own business. Yeah yeah yeah... Paru told me about it. Paru? Ah... Parvathi. Yeah yeah... Parvathi told me about it. You can call her Paru. If others do, she'll get really angry. Including me. You guys keep talking. I'll go get ready. Yeah, Okay. You came to meet me... After all these years! Then why did you come now? I don't know if people leave me or I make them leave me! I thought you left me back then, because I have nothing. But only now I realize that you made me everything that I'm today. You are the best thing that happened to me. Paru... What you told me that day changed my entire life. I've never compromised in life after that day. I achieved everything I dreamed about. But if we forget where we started... Our destination will lose it's value. My friend said so. You are the reason that I even started Paru. Thank you so much! Thank you so much for being my best friend. I've come all the way, to tell you this. Tell me... How is the land lord doing? Paru... What happened, Paru? She has not cared for my prestige and my love towards her... She stepped out of the house for an outsider. -What does that mean? -Listen to me... Look... Allowing her back into the house is already too much to ask for. Tell her not to talk to me, ever again. 17 years... Not even a single word... [mobile rings] Hello, mom... Parvathi... What dear? Dad... How are you? I'm good, dad. I got angry with you for no reason... And kept you at bay all these years. Can you forgive this dad for once? Only after Abhi came to me... I realized my mistake. I want to see you all. Please come see me tomorrow, if you can. I'm starting right away, dad. "The wound you inflicted melted down like a beautiful dream." "Thank you!" "My heart got really light..." "Thank you." "Thank you for the heart that showed me the way." "For the sacrifice you made for me..." "For the memories that will melt the heart away..." "Thank you for everything." "Don't know to whom I owe what..." "Thank you!" "Reaching the shore I say thank you." "Thank you!" "For chasing away the darkness..." "And bringing in light..." "For all those hands that helped me, know your worth..." "Thank you for all your love." Feeling so good man! You did the right thing, coming to India. I want to talk to Priya. -Excuse me, room number. -303. Thank you. [mobile ringing] [mobile ringing] Priya! Do you know what you are doing? An abortion! What did I tell you? To give Abhi another chance, right? It takes time for humans to change, Priya. I don't think so, Aunty. The Abhi I once knew is non-existent now. And I don't want this Abhi. I don't even want his memory. Excuse me, ma'am. It's time. To be the Abhiram she wanted to see... It's a long journey, my friend. You are right... I'm ready. Where to next? Vizag. The city you got educated in... Vizag. What for? To meet old friends? Kill him! How dare you touch my sister! I'll kill you. [Abhi screaming] Sharva! You... Abhi! Get lost... This is my city. No way... No freaking way! I'll kill him the moment I see him. No! VISAKHAPATNAM College is not just about friendship and love stories. There will be fights and enemies too. One enemy can teach you something that 100 friends can't. How to face problems? How to struggle to win... The one who taught you all this is your enemy... Jyothi theater man. We booked the entire theater for the fans' show. VISAKHAPATNAM How many do you want? Not possible... But let's see. Hey, what's with that disturbance? -What we give is what he gets. -OK. 10 will do. Next. -[counting] -Brother, 10 tickets. We are not giving any tickets to you and your friends. Get inside. You know, not giving tickets to girls is a sin. Look how rough the title sounds... 'Pokiri' (Rogue). Also it's the first time Puri is directing him. Please! Not 10... I'm giving you 15 tickets... But if you are late, even by one second, I'll throw all of you out. Thanks! Next... Hey... Put it there! A cigarette to compensate for the beer. Give me a puff. Is it? I'll slap you across your face. Get inside. Let's give 5 more tickets to Pawan. He'll become a cry baby again. -And? -Write 5 more in Pawan's account. Hey, what's the height of our cutout? 35 feet. 5 feet higher than last time. Dammit! They are putting up 40 feet cutout at Sangam theater. -40? -Yeah. Hey, your dad in an MLA here. And you are the fans association president. Think about our image if someone else puts up bigger cutout than ours. Listen... Our cutout should be the biggest in the entire city. -Yes. -It will be! Shankar... You said you'll be here by 12, right? Is our cutout ready? Long back. There. I packed it in a cloth. Pull it and a 35 feet cutout stands. People can't stop whistling. -A small change. -What's that? -Should increase its height by a little. -A little? -OK, by how much? -10 feet. Not possible. Postpone the movie by ten days if you want to. -Then I'll make you a cutout of 200 feet. -Hey! -Will it be possible now or not? -Not possible. Where did they get the 40 feet cutout made? This is the shop. Hey... I think this is their 40 feet cutout. He's fully drunk. This is our chance to steal it. [band playing] [people cheering] Hey, I can't hear anything. Hit it! The whole of Vizag should hear the sound. Open! Brother... That's not Mahesh's cutout! Hey, Sharva... So you all are my fans! We've been to the same college for three years now. But you never told me this! 40 feet cutout is a little too much. I feel really proud to have such a fan-base. Vasu... Now. That's our cutout! "One can't stand the other here." "Every gang is filled with its pride!" "Fearless boys go make some noise." "Get your blood charged up..." "Bring it back to the school!" "Show them your swag." "No time for schools, they've got no rules." "Just go full thug life." "Always ready to fight!" I saw him first on the day of selections. A very important moment in life. You have left on one... But hockey. And the hockey stick dad gave you. He had no idea how important it is to you. Breaking dad's hockey stick... He tampered with both your emotion and dream at once. He turned into your enemy. "This is the fight that will decide if you are hero or a villain." "Just hit it like you are at war." Why did you hit so hard? I'm never compromising again in life. I left a lot behind to get here. It's the hockey stick my dad gifted me. I'm not letting him get away with it. "Hit it like you are at war." "The winner has to be decided right now." "Always be ready for a fight." "Right and wrong doesn't matter anymore!" "I'm telling you, don't poke into my business." "I'll break your fort like a magic." "I'm my army that'll go anywhere." "Touch me and you'll pay right away." "We are not going to leave this courage behind." "My fist will come at you like a typhoon." "Hit it like you are at war." "The winner has to be decided right now." "Always be ready for a fight." "Right and wrong doesn't matter anymore!" "One can't stand the other here." "Every gang is filled with its pride!" "Fearless boys go make some noise." "Get your blood charged up..." "Bring it back to the school!" "Show them your swag." "No time for schools, they've got no rules." "Just go full thug life." Three years ago... The entire stadium used to chant the name 'Sharva' like a mantra. But now... Everything changed with him. Now everyone's mantra changed to 'Abhiram'. Today... In front of everyone... He made a fool out of me, making me worship his poster with milk. Hey, what are you doing here? -Mom sent coffee. -Hey... I'm not in the mood for coffee. Someone go get me a beer. -Who's Abhiram? -Why do you care? Get inside. For the Nth time! I got vexed with those words. Chinnu! Today is Rakhi Purnima (an Indian festival of brother-sister relationship). Do you remember? Yeah, I remember, mom. Where's the Rakhi? It's on the table. He'll be sleeping till the evening anyway. Go tie him the Rakhi. Fast... There's my purse. Brother... There's a girl here to meet you. A girl? Coming. -Abhiram... -Yeah. -Give me your hand. -What for? Because I asked you to. Backwards... Money... Oh... So this is a new kind of loot! Tie Rakhi to every Tom Dick and Harry for money. Hey... As if I'm asking for millions! Give me whatever you can. You shouldn't fight with Sharva from now on. You shouldn't hit him anymore. What? Why so? I tied Rakhi to you, right? So that makes you my brother. You should listen to me. Why do you care if I hit him or not? Because he's also my brother. He won't listen to me anyway. So I'm requesting you. -OK, what's your name? -OK, bye. Hello, sister... Tell me your name. Chinnu. Chinnu. Today we are going to learn about linear rotation... Excuse me, sir. DMS sir is calling for Sharva. What! I'm the DMS sir. -I mean... IAM sir. -OK. -Sharva... -Should we come along? Where is sir? It's not sir who called you. It's me. What for? I need to talk to you about something important. What's that? I don't know how to say it. The hand that she tied rakhi to is... [Sharva screams] I've tied a Rakhi to Abhi too. Now Abhi and my brother won't fight anymore. Not everyone gets a sister like me, right! Hey, I'll call you again. Hey, where's Abhiram? I saw him upstairs. Hey, Chinnu... Come here. Did you have your breakfast? Come, let's go to the mess. -Ramu... -Yes, bro. Two idly and a Vada. Fast. Chinnu, what do you want? Tea, coffee, tiffin... Tell me. I don't want these fake respect. Here is your one rupee. Give me back my rakhi. Ah! Our boss just said, right? Once he commits to something, he won't even listen to himself. Even if I give you back the rakhi, or lose it. Or even if you don't tie me one every year... You are my sister and that's fixed. Then why didn't you listen to this sister? I asked you not to fight with Sharva, right? They say you called him out of the class and fought with him. Even I researched about rakhi a little. Protecting the sister who tied us a rakhi is enough. No need to take care of her friends and family. OK OK, what do you want me to do? Not fight with Sharva, right? Let's do something. Ask Sharva to tie me a rakhi. I'll stop hitting him and even protect him. OK? Ask him to tie me a good one. I'll give him ten rupees. What say? -Damn you! -Chinnu Chinnu... Chinnu! I know one of my brothers is an idiot. I just realized that the other one is an even bigger idiot. Chinnu... Chinnu... Chinnu, stop! Remember this... You are my only family. Ours is a lifelong relation now. Any kind of problem, just tell this Abhi brother... OK? [players shouting] Abhi, it'll start in ten minutes. Coach asked me to tell you. -OK, done. -All the best. Thanks! How many times should I tell you? Can't you understand? Don't irritate me again and keep your respect. Hey... What! Are you harassing her in the name of love? -No, sir. -Do you think Chinnu has no one? If I ever see you going behind her again. I'll skin you alive, scoundrel! Sir, I'm not in love with her. She's in love with me. I said 'No', but she's not listening to me. She's even scolding me for it. Please try to scare her away from me the way you just did, sir. What do you mean? Don't she look beautiful? -I don't mean that, sir. -Isn't she in your league? What's not right about her for you to reject her? Listen, spectacles... You can't find a girl like her anywhere in this world. Listen to me carefully. Go tell her that you love her. Got it? Hey, take her to movies if she wants to see one. Coffee, shopping... Whatever she wants. Take care of her. Go! The entire college should remember it forever. Let's arrange booze to all the juniors and professors. What with the booze discussion so early in the morning! Not booze, sir. He got hurt and we are planning to get him to a doctor. Shut up, idiots! -Abhi... -Sir. None of them has to think about tomorrow. He'll settle, taking care of his father's supermarket. He has a fortune he inherited from his grandpa. But your future is only hockey... You said your father's dream is you planning for the Indian team, right? For that to happen, you need to be selected in this match. I've worked hard to bring in the selectors for you. -OK, sir. -All the best. Boys, get ready for practice, fast. He's bringing selectors for this match for the sake of Abhi. If he performs well, he'll be selected for railways. How will he be selected if he can't even play the game? What's the plan? [crowd cheering] [coin clinking] Sharva? Defence... The men we called will be among the public at the boundary in red t shirts. Red t shirts will be easy for me to remember. Abhi always plays right forward. I'm left end marker. So I'll be covering him the entire match. Even the ball comes to me, I'll leave it. So ball will always be with Abhi. I'll be running along with him. As we reach these four people, as if it's an accident... I'll push Abhi onto them. Before the referee and the public understands... The fifth man will come and stab him from behind. And he'll come out of the field as 'retired hurt'. If he can't even play, how will he attract attention of the panel? They can't plan a new match just for him, right? Among the public at the boundary in red t shirts. As we reach these four people, as if it's an accident... I'll push Abhi onto them. The fifth man will come and stab him from behind. [crowd cheering] [CROWD]: Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! [crowd cheering] Do you think your cheer girl rowdies will scare me? Four is too less a number for me. Next time, plan at least ten. Play a proper game first! How did he! Come on... Come on, boys. Stop wasting time on marking Abhi. We don't even have one goal. Listen up... We are not playing to win. Let's not give Abhi any chance to score a goal. The hell with his railways and selections! Guys... break off... Stay away! Abhi... Have you gone mad? Dammit! Abhi! Don't come close. Chinnu, come on... Sit. What's with your romance on the ground? You helped me by messaging Sharva's plan, right? That's why I've decided to listen to you from now on. I won't bother him anymore. Even if he hits me... I won't hit him back. I kissed him so that you'll get it clearly. Tell me this... What's with this sudden love towards this brother? Nothing like that. If his plan worked, your rivalry would only have been worse. I messaged you only for that not to happen. Of course, I don't want you to get hurt too. You got selected for the railways, right? Congrats! A small suggestion... Never scare the ones we love. We have to express our love softly. Understood? How? With a hockey stick on the neck... And a harsh warning to love. That softly? -Bye. -Bye. He crossed his limits. Tomorrow is the farewell party. Everyone will have a lot of happy moments in college days. But for me... Apart from getting thrashed by him and losing to him... I don't have a single good memory. If I can't even hurt him back... How will I hurt my opponents in politics? We should get him all alone after the farewell party tomorrow. We will find him alone! [no voice] Where's my phone! -Mom, did you see my phone? -Look properly! "Five years with mom and dad" "Five more years with the gully gang" "Five years with high school mates" "Five more years with college batch" "There was a lot of celebration" "We have enjoyed a lot." "All these little things we did will live in our hearts forever" "Let's give a send off" "To this college life" "Let's welcome... let's welcome" "Our new life" "Lots of anger, love, and smiles." "Friendships, enemies, and first loves too." "Lots of competitions, wounds, and trophies." "Lots of dreams and tears." "All these memories and experiences..." "Those will be the foundation to our forts." "We will be the letters of these signatures..." "We should be together, forever." "Let's give a send off" "To this college life" "Let's welcome... let's welcome" "Our new life" [message beep] Waiting for you in hockey ground. Need to talk about something important. Chinnu... Chinnu, where are you? Chinnu... You messaged me to come meet you, right? Chinnu, we are getting late. Let's go. Chinnu, let's go. Where are you? Get him... Hit him! Thrash that moron! He shouldn't get up. Along with messing with my life... You dragged my sister into this. Drag him in! Thrash him! You told him to love my sister and you think I'll keep calm! I'll kill you. She's my sister. Mine alone. I can take care of her. Who the hell are you! Do you want to play for the railways? I'll see how? You kissed me out of happiness in front of everyone, right? I'm even more happier right now. -Pull his hand. -Go on. Pull. Catch him tightly. You can never hold a hockey stick in your life. This will come back onto us. Let's kill him... Right now! Hey! Hey! Go find Abhi! You two, go that way. You go this way. He's here. Abhi... run! This is my city... If you ever think of coming back... Or even turning back to take a look... I'll kill and bury you right here. Come back and I'll kill you! Remember that. [people sloganeering] A son who made his father proud. A proud son of our Vizag city. Sri Yalanti Sharva Reddy sir... He won the assembly elections with a majority of 1.8 lakh votes. This is a hug win. We are going to inaugurate a cutout of 80 feet of Sharva Reddy to celebrate this. Friends and well wishers... Please bless our leader with a big heart. [crowd whistling and cheering] In a few minutes... Our dear leader Sharva Reddy's 80 feet cutout will be inaugurated. Do it... Fast. -Stop it... Right now. -OK, sir. Hey, do it fast... Idiot! I'm telling you to stop! To celebrate this huge with such a huge majority... We are arranging rallies in the city. We request our party members and fans to make it a hit. [crowd continues to cheer] Abhi! How are you? How long it's been since I saw you for the last time! Stop! Come on... I have a lot to talk with you. I didn't expect that you'll receive me this way. I have a reason for that. Just like in college, I fought with everyone in politics too. Whatever we give... will come back to us. Karma. Hey... What's this? What happened? I got used to making enemies everywhere. A bomb attack happened on my car six years ago. I was hospitalized for 4 months. Every single day in the hospital... I thought about you. I did so much wrong to you. I understood. I was feeling guilty all these years! I wanted to find you and say that I'm sorry. But how can I even face you? I did what I did, and you are here again to meet me. Then... Now... Forever... You are the great one. I'm really happy! Forget all that. Let's go... She'll be very excited to know that you are here. -Where to? -Of course, to meet Chinnu. -What did I have to do with her? -Hey... I know how close you two are. If we are that close, why did she message me to come to the ground that day? It's me who messaged you that day. I used her phone. She has no idea, even now. She did nothing wrong. She felt really bad when you went missing all of a sudden. She missed you a lot! Every year, she bought an extra rakhi for you. I used to feel jealous about her affection towards you. [door bell rings] Where did you go all these days? I'm back, right? You said that I'm your family. I'm your sister for this whole life and more... You went off, even without telling me. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. You've forgot about this sister, right? No... I wanted to achieve something... And I've lost a lot of close ones in the process. And now, I'm trying to make all that right. This won't happen again, Chinnu. I promise. From now on, on every rakhi... Wherever I am... I'll come to you. OK? Forgive this brother for now... Please! Sharva, I didn't come all this way to hear your apologies. I just wanted to tell you something. If you haven't broken my hand that day... I would have got selected for railways and be playing hockey along with the job. I wouldn't have been here, for sure. I was on a train, with my broken hand... No doctor... No medical help... And I wanted to know what happened to my hand. That's when I got the idea... That's being useful for millions of people all over the world today. That's just because of you. Thanks. You've changed my life. I am here to tell you this. Thank you so much. "We got separated a long back, but friend you kept me in your heart..." "My friend" "A friend who came to me with a smile, even though the past is sad..." "My friend" "To your friendship that proved even opposite paths can meet at some point..." "For those who said 'I'm here for you', a lifelong thank you." "To the hand that took you to your goal..." "Thank you." "I thank every heart that has been there" "Thank you." She should come to me with so much happiness of giving this news. But she didn't. Now I understand how much I should have hurt her. If I go meet her now... The distance between us will increase further. Then what do you want to do? -When did you come? -Just now. Six months ago, we came to America because of Rao sir. We fought with him, about not being placed and our visas getting expired. I thought about us until the very last minute... He got us all placed in Vaidhya... Abhi came to meet me. Abhi... What are you doing here? Come inside. I'm sorry. Abhi, it's OK. I'm so sorry. He fulfilled your uncle's last wish. Because of experiences, insult, or greed... Man will turn self centered. That's common, dear. But... Getting back to normal is a great thing. I know how much you love Abhi. Go, Priya... Go meet Abhi. You'll see Abhi just the way you wanted to see him. Hi, Priya! Welcome back! What are you doing here? Abhi came here and apologized. Not just me. He met Neelesh, Vishwa, and everyone else. He gave all of us great jobs at Vaidhya. Abhi resigned as the CEO. Subscription free? Vaidhya users got increased by 10 fold now. That too for free. All the employees are now share holders. He said that Vaidhya is everyone's from now on. When asked what he did all this for... I've started Vaidhya with Priya's investment. I don't want it without her. -Where's Abhi? -He said he was heading to the airport. I'll just be back. I thought you are leaving to India. What will I do in India with you here? If you haven't left me that day... I wouldn't have realized my mistake, Priya. I got success because of you in my life. I changed from the fear of losing you. You made me a better person, Priya. Thank you! I just want to ask your forgiveness... I need to tell you something. We are about to be parents. Thank you! When we look back at your lives... We will find a lot of people who helped us and supported us throughout. Meet them and thank them heart-fully. I'm saying this out of experience. That one word will make your life more beautiful. Thank you! THANK YOU Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
