You can draw reproduction as a red flower in the work book. ...major discoveries in the world. that is completely wrong. There is nobody who has been discovered. They were travellers and eventually they reached America. There, they found people who already had discovered themselves. freeeeee!!! It's summer! freeeeee!!! Joy of Summer Feel it. Piss hot. As if. Lukewarm. We can swim. - But there are no adults here. - We can swim then. - But what about bathing shorts? - We can swim without them. - But towels? - We'll get dry in the sun. - But what if somebody sees us! - Bah! Okay then. - Was she laughing at us? - Can't see that far. Come on, Heidi! No, don't. What if, what if, what if the giant eel eats you. The biggest one can eat a whole sheep. Does yours shrink in water too? No. The monster probably took yours. And your nose too! - It's good that he disappeared. - Huh? Yeah, because what would he do when we're kissing? Laugh a little. - Can you kiss? - Um-hmm. You've probably practiced on your mom. No, you have. - Hey you? - Yes? What's kissing like? Like this. Doesn't taste like anything. No taste? You have to close your eyes and think of somebody. - Who are you thinking of? - Kare. Well, then I'm thinking of Ase. My dear, good old volkswagen. You have to start now. My dear, volkswagen. - I have to pee. - We'll have a peeing competition. I'll go first. Okay then. Ready, steady, go! I'll show you now. One, two, two and a half. False start! What did you want me to see? Yeah, but I didn't have to go. Okay, let's do a rematch now. Ase and Kari! Oystein and Trond with their pants down! That's so childish! We're going to tell that you swam alone. You guys will get beat up. They will probably not tell. - But they've seen us, Oystein. - We swam naked last year. Yeah, last year. - Is it hot? - Is it too hot for bathing shorts? - What should we do now? - We can go backwards. - That's no better, you fool. - I'm almost freezing my ass off now. - Should we? - Yes. Look! Come and get it! Come and get it! Come and get it! - Come on. - No, I want to see some more. - What are we having for dinner today? - Fish. Hi Oystein! - Have you been swimming? - No. Your hair is completely wet. Wet hair? Eh, well... Trond and I were out... looking for herring. Yeah, you should have seen the huge eel, it could have eaten a sheep. Yeah, so? And then it got so hot... that I... dipped my head in the stream. Yeah, you know you're not allowed to swim in the creek, right? Of course I know. It's probably very cold anyway. But... Hello? Hello? Oh, my, isn't it Oystein's dad? Oystein? Yes. Yes, it's Ida. Ida Loe. Oystein's teacher. I'm Per Lier. Do you have to sneeze? I need a book shelf. I've got the measurements and everything here. Do you have anyone to help you with this? Yeah, so then I can ehhh... ss.. saw it, I mean. So, you should come back if there's anything you need. Yes, thank you. I could call you one day. I don't have a phone. Oh, but we'll meet in the city one day. So. Okay, bye for now. Good luck. Hi boys, I'm here. No! What the...? Juice all over the floor. - Oh well. - Puddle. So, it's almost vacation then... - Are we having proper dinner? - Beef steaks with onions. Every day? Yeah. Dad. Dad! Every day? - Let's take them now. - Should we? Are you guys going to take us? Yes. - Just try. - Oh, you guys won't dare. - We'll take them some other time. - Don't be a chicken. - Ase is pretty strong. - Don't you remember what they did? Do you want to have a peeing competition? But you guys are handicapped. - Not in length. - Have you tried? Yeah, in Ase's bathroom. I won. - Should we? - Guess. Not me. Peace or what? - Peace. - Peace. Help! Did you hurt yourself? Let's swim naked. I can't swim naked. - No. - Sure we can! All of us. Yes! - No, it's bad for Jesus. - Bah, his dad created us! Don't be a chicken. This is great. Apples and pears, hanging in the tree, when they ripen, they fall down. That's the way it is, that's the way it is, This is how they all come from the world's oldest tree. Guys? You won't tell anyone, right? That we swam without clothes No! - You have been naked before. - Yes, before. When we were small. But it's no different now. Sure it is. It is bad to be naked now that we are so big. You're the same. And you've always been ugly. And we're going to get uglier and uglier. And warts everywhere. And lots of hair in the bum. But soon, we'll be completely different. Eh, I don't want to be that big. Me neither. Let's race again. Stupid! - I didn't mean to push you. - Stupid, stupid, stupid! Bed time, boys. Go brush your teeth, Arne. Go brush your teeth... now! Just one more. Only one. Oystein? Your teacher... is she nice? Yeah, she's all right. What about her husband? What does he do? Husband? Don't know. Maybe he's a... umm... pilot. Pilot? Why do you think so? Because pilots always have pretty wives. Two flat, two flat, two flat, two flat, two flat, two flat. Good night, Oystein! - Hi! - Hi, where is Kari? She is inside regretting her sins. What? Sins? Has she done something? Maybe she didn't finish her dinner, because her parents are pretty strict. - Gee! - Shall we start or what? Elle, melle deg dortelle. The boat sails this year. Back to back, two in a secchiello. Snipp, snapp, snute, You are not on the sailing boat. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Let's hide better. - Where? - In the woods. - It's not allowed. Sure it is. Come. Come and set me free! - Should we? - Come on. Where are you guys? Come out. What are we doing now? Eh. We can get undressed again. You can see me if I can see you. But I've seen you before. But it's much more exciting now because... ...we can kiss without clothes. Mmm... only if it stays a secret between the two of us. Yes. But I don't have to take it off completely because it's so wet here. No. - What about you? Aren't you? - Eh, sure. - Can you kiss? - Mm-mm. Hurry up and do it before Jorgen comes. Ouch! - What if we have kids, Oystein? - What? - It's Kari's dad. - Hush! He is very angry. Maybe he's here to take dad. - I've already told you. - But they were naked! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you probably think it was Oystein who talked her into doing it. Yes, and he knocked her down so her nose started bleeding. But they swam naked last year. Not our Kari. The kids are so big now. They're far from being sexually mature. Do you think I'm stupid? I won't accept such things no matter what. What does sexually mature mean? Maybe it's like apples and pears. When they are mature they fall down. I didn't hit Kari. She fell and hurt herself. And the second part is something Ase made up. Were the two of you watching? No, but we heard everything. What does sexually mature mean, Dad? Later, Arne. So is this why the bathing shorts were dry? It was Ase. You shouldn't tell on others, Oystein. Everyone managed to bring their shorts. - So, was it fun? - Fun, yes! Ehh... ehh... no. It must have been a little fun. Yeah, maybe. Is this sexually mature? No. Yes, maybe. But next time, you'll have to wear your bathing shorts, Oystein. So there won't be any more boloney. Right? And now, this conversation is over. Let's eat. I think I'll go out. - Are you sleeping, Oystein? - Yeah, almost. - Good night, my son. - Dad? What does sexually mature mean? Sexually mature? It means that you can have kids. Oh! Is that why we have to wear bathing shorts? Bathing shorts? Ohh... like that. Yeah, kind of. Well, no. You see, you can't have kids just because you took off your shorts. But if you do a little more than that. Yes, if you do a little more than that. So, Ase can... Ase can... Ase? No, she's too young. The book shelf is completed now. You should come and tell me what you think if you have time one day. Regards to you and Oystein. Miss Ida. Hey, wait for me! Stop! Ehh, I'm here to see Ida Loe. Separate entrance. I must warn you. Petter is apparently inside. Petter? Is it? You're gonna pay for this. Heeeeeelp! You're so childish. I'm not really allowed to be with you, but there's nobody else here, so. Bah. Don't listen to your shitty dad. - It's mom who told me to. - Why is that? - Because of the things you do. - Like what? That you pushed me so I started bleeding. And then... Like this! You are so stupid! Shitty girl! Do you want to be my girlfriend? Kari up and Kari down, Kari up and Kari down, Kari every day, Kari is a bitch, Kari up and Kari down, Kari every day, Kari is a bitch, You're gonna pay for this. Now, what do you think? Be honest. Well, it is special. So you don't think it's a nice book shelf? Yeah, it's very nice. Thanks, master! - So, do you have a dog? - Yes, I do. It's all right with some company, you know. I'm alone a lot. He is probably a pilot. they have pretty wives. Bye, bye. I've got things to do. It's been raining like crazy this summer. Yes, it's almost good enough to fish in the sea. Yeah, fishing trip. It's been a long time since I've done that. Well, if you want you can go fishing with me. Do you mean that, Per? Oh, I can hear Petter. - Is there much time left? - No, not very much. - Hi! - Hi dad! Oh, my. Are you washing your own clothes? - No, not clothes. - Potatoes. And they're boiled. - And centrifuged? - Yes! Mashed potatoes! No! That's very efficient. And it's even better that she's not coming today. - Who? - Ida. We don't know anyone named Ida. But you know somebody, Oystein. Miss Ida. But it's vacation, dad. I haven't done anything. What are you doing? - Don't eat that! - But they're salty. Why is she coming? Just for a visit. Maybe we can go fishing together. All of us. You're kidding! You are so stupid, dad! Fishing trip. You don't know how teachers are. We probably have to raise our hands every time we get a bite. There's an eel here. Giant eel. Mmm... Red eel is very good. Oh, it's been so long since I've done this, Per. Oh, my, look. Gosh, he caught a fish. Yes, look at that. Gosh, Oystein caught a fish too. Should I have raised my hand maybe? Can't you go and get Arne, Oystein? Ida and I will go and grill the fish. Give me some. I can push you again. Bah! We have company. You'll never guess who it is. Sure. It's just a lady with red hair. Red hair? It was Miss Ida. Bah. You can never fool me. - Wanna bet? - Sure. For what? Fizzy powder. I'll win anyway. What will I get? An ice cream. Let me see. - Who is it? - We have to hide. Why? Well, because maybe... no, I think it will be worth while. You're just kidding. Certainly, it's true. Can I see one more time? Yeah, only once. Oh my god! Has your dad kissed her? He's completely nuts. - No! - Sure! She didn't get mad or anything. Are they... are they... are they lovers? They've been at it all day. Do you want some? Do you want to be boyfriend - girlfriend? Mmm-hmm. - We have to kiss then. - Do we have to? Mmm-hmm. They'll need air soon!
