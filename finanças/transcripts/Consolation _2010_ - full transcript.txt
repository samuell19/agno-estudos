Nechama (also consolation) Nechama? Nechama.. aren't you getting up Nechama, I'll be in the garden. Fine, Menachem, fine. Hello? Hi, Grandma. Yes, I saw you called. I just... Oh no, Grandma, I totally forgot about it. But I can't come over. I'm sorry. Grandma, I can' I'll call you back, okay? Thefea's kind of bitter, isn't it? is the cake in the oven? Nechama? -What? Did you put. the cake in the oven? Oh...not yet. in a minute. be careful. You don't want what happened last time to happen again. Does your battery need changing? -No. I talk to you, but you don't answer. My battery doesn't need changing. And the tea isn't.bitter. I took out the teabag just in time. I said it was kind of bitter. Just a bit. You have to know exactly when to... Forget it. Menachem. Nechama? I've been calling you for 'minutes now and you don't answer. What do you need, Menachem? I can't find my white shirt. Your white shirt? It's in the closet, on the left. No. it isn't there. No? -No, and it isn't on the right either. Maybe you forgot to iron it. What? Nothing. What are you doing? I'm rearranging your shirts. You don't wear these. Yes I do. When do you ever wear them? -I wear them. Nechama? Nechama, what is it? Easy, easy... What's with you today? Menachem.. we have to talk. You realize you're talking nonsense, don't you? I know it's hard to believe, but that's how it is, Menachem. It's nonsense, Nechama. -It isn't nonsense. How can you be sure about such a thing? I don't know. You just know. Just like I knew about my mother, just like I knew about Ruti before she went away, just like I knew about you and Nava Rosenbaum. I'm not trying to get back at you. I had a dream, and the dog... Is this whole discussion because of a stupid dream? No, it isn't a stupid dream. Well, enough. I don't want to listen any more. If this is your way of punishing me for something that happened 32 years ago... Menachem, please come back. Don't you feel well? What is it? Chills? Arthritis? I always have that. No, I... I know that today is the day. I just know it. I don't understand, Nechama. I need you to believe me, Menachem. Hi, this is Ruti. I'm a bit busy right now, leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Have a great day. Ruti Call me. Thank you. Sorry. When can I go home? We want to change your medication, so you'll feel better again, and make sure it works for you and you feel like yourself again... So you'll be staying with us for a few more weeks. Does it matter if I say no? Good question. Let's wait a little while we'll see how you feel in a few days. Than1^ you, Yael, you can wait outside. All right... Third suicide attempt... I don't want to be here. Try to sit. Come on. I really do think we can help you. Really? When you said before that you want to die, were you saying it out of anger or... -It was real. May I ask why? Why do you want to live? We're talking about you now. It's obvious you're a student. -It is, huh? Yes. But still...? If you could really see me, you wouldn't have to ask why. How do you really look? Drop it. -I really want to know. Can I smoke here? How do you look? Clad in sackcloth and ashes, . crawling on my belly, bleeding. Spit and blood and sperm drip from my mouth. Was that too heavy for you? Donlget too upset, I stole thatjiine from my aunt. When her son was killed, that's what she recited over his grave. Except for the part about the blood and sperm, that's really mine. You know, for a second there I could really see you like that. I mean, I still see the cynical, strong Yael who doesn't take any shit, but... -I stole that line. So as I said, I really think we can help you. I don't want to live. Why should I want help with something I don't want? Yael, wait a second. I saw the new girl leaving, so I thought maybe we can meet now? We said two o'clock, Nissim. Yes, but... Why not now? We can talk a little longer, no? I'm sorry, Nissim. Two o'clock. All right? Hello? Hi, Grandpa. No, it was off. I'm at work. What? No, I'm fine. I can’t come today, I told you. What do you mean, an emergency? I wouldn't tell you if'It wasn't important. Yes;, yes, everyone is fine But it's very important that you come. No, I can't tell you over the phone. You just have to come. We're waiting for you. Hi, this is Ruti. I'm a bit busy right now, leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Have a great day. Ruti.... It's Mom again. Please call me when you can. It's urgent. What happened, Menachem? t stabbed me. Wait a second, I need a bandage. Nechama, are you planning to tell her? I mean... Are you going to tell her today that... You know, that today you... Yes. I think so. Maybe you should think about it first. You also said it was important. Yes. You think we shouldn't? I think you should think about it. You shouldn't upset her for no reason. it isn't "for no reason." Yes, I know that's what you think. But... If it happens, it happens. It'll also scare her if you tell her. Maybe we should leave things as they are. Just.. Just so we'll have a nice day together. Neta’le isn't a little girl anymore. Yes, I know. But it's better this way. Isn't it? Yes, it's the right thing to do. Now that she's finally coming over... 'll call her in a minute. We don't want to nag her. It's the right thing to do, Nechama. Dr. Tsur? Hjey, Neta'le. Comg in, come in Well, how did it go with Yael? It isn't easy. I don't think she'll want to go on with the conversations. Have you read "The House of God"? It's a must-read for anyone who wants to work in a hospitals. There's.. a great line that the doctor says to his students, "What's the difference between life and a penis?" What? "Life is always hard." Dr. Tsur, I'm sorry, I have to go out for a little while. Aren't you supposed to be here till five? Yes. Neta, I take in students who are prepared to work hard. I know. It's.. It's an emergency. I see. It's my grandmother... She’s sick. I understand, Neta. The oven... That's the door, Menachem. We'll spend a nice day together. She's at the door. Is everything all right, Grandpa? Yes. What's going on? Everything's fine. Sweetheart.. Then what... What was so urgent? Are you all right? We're just fine. Good. It smells like something's burning. Oh, the cake... -Oh, Grandma, how many times have I told you, you don't have to do that. And I can't stay long. I dropped everything to come. I'm at the hospital today. I totally forgot was supposed to come see you. Neta'le, you know I don't mind, but it's hard on Grandpa... -I' forgot. So what was the phone call about? I thought Grandpa had something urgent to tell me. ... Menachem.. One second. We never see you. You haven't come by for two weeks. We wanted to make sure you're all right. Okay, I... I'm fine, but I'm in the middle of work. -And here's the cake. I thought there was more time... Well, it's a tiny bit over-baked, but that's all right. Menachem. Neta is asking what was so important. Oh... Yes.. Neta, it's... the house. What? The house. Grandma and I were talking... and we decided.. to give it to you. Not now. After we... But not in the near future. Not at all. So you don't have to worry. Thank you, really. I thought there was something wrong. Well, it isn't an ordinary decision. You don't say such things over the phone. No, of course not. It's just that I thought... I thought it was something urgent. e wanted to make you happy. Thank you. Thank you, really, Grandma. Wow... Wow, thank you so much... Not that I hope it happens soon, but... But it's great to know that... But the most important thing is that you're well. Really. Wow. Don't force her. Don't force her if she doesn't want it, Menachem. 'm not forcing her. But still.. It's fine. But you don't have to bake every time, Grandma. Really. And I'm not crazy about yeast cakes. What do you mean? They're your favorite. Yes, when I was five. Have you spoken to Mom today? No, she's busy with the new exhibition. I think she'll be hard to reach until Sunday. How's work? Fine. Are you still with those nuts? Yes, Grandpa, and I wish you wouldn't call them that, okay? We spoke about this. But that's what they are, isn't it? I mean, you work in a nuthouse. Are you volunteering? I'm ve/y sorry... -What's wrong? Thanks for the cake and., the house, but I really have to go. Can't you stay a little longer? Sweetheart. I'll call you, okay? I want to talk to you. -Nechama. But I... -Nechama. I'm going to die today. What? I'm going to die. What do you mean, "die"? Die. Do you mean physically or... the way you feel? 'm going to die. What's with you today? I mean, really. If this is some kind of sick joke... No, I don't have much time, there are people who need me there. It's no joke. So when she comes can you tell her we're looking for her? Yes. Thank you. Isn't there anywhere else she could be? I'll try another number. Can't you call from here? All right... Hi, Jesus, it's Neta. I really need to speak to Mom, Ruti. So can you please tell her to call me? -"Jesus..." I've never heard of him. It's urgent. -Neither have I. Maybe it's someone from the gallery. Who is that? I don't know, someone she works with. Where did you get his number? Grandpa, what's with the interroqation? They're friends. I met him when I was there. s he Jewish? -"Jesus"? Menachem, "Jesus." I'm going outside to smoke. It just came out. Yes. She should know. Yes, she's very helpful. How do you feel? I don't know. And your "feeling" Still have it? I can't make it happen faster, Menachem. Galia? Hey. I'll be here a little longer. Yes. Yes, I know. Well, can you tell Nissim? Can you apologize on my behalf? The religious giuy. Yes. Just tell him I'm... I'm sorry.. That next w£ek... I might even make ii.t tomorrow. What's going on, Grandpa? I didn't want to ask in front of her, but is she 'all right? Are there any signs of dementia? Memory loss or anything Has she ever mentioned hearing voices? Riituals, things sft© fewer did before9 She isn't crazy, Neta. you don't really believe her, do you? Just because she says she has a feeling doesn't mean it's going to happen. Maybe it's a subconscious wish. It's true she's seemed unhappy for the past few years Reading a few books doesn't make you an expert on your grandmothers life no Not at all I'm just trying to understand we have to talk about this and figure out what she's trying to tell us She says she's going to die, Neta. But how does she knew? I don't know. I've heard of people who know such things. Really? Who? I don't know, but your grandmother knows things. Is that Ruti? You can go if you like. No... it's fine. Don't be silly. It's fine. I didn't know about the cake. What a waste, all those years.. You never said anything. Go away. Go away. Hi, Galia. No, it looks like I won't make it today. No, I can't. So will you talk to him? So lead the group by yourself. You're always saying that I get in your way, so for once it's all yours. Okay? -Okay. bye You're pruning everything. There won't be anything left. But this is how I always do it. Do you want to drive somewhere? I don't know. Should I make you some tea? Enough with your stupid tea! I'm sorry, Menachem, I'm so sorry. All I did was offer her tea. "Tusedays with Mori" (Also teacher) This is a book I'm reading now, Grandma. It's about exactly what you're going through. I don't think I'll Jjave time to read it.. It's about someone who's about to die and how he prepares for it. How much time does he h -A few months. The thing is, he has all sorts of insights, and he uses the time he has left to talk about them. I'm not sure.. that I have "insights." Then maybe you can just tell us something. Something about your life, Grandma. I don't want to die. Maybe it's just your head or your soul telling you that you're having a ha’rd time now. It isn't real, Grandma. That's right. It's just a feeling. It could be a mistake, that what you're feeling is a mistake. Maybe it's someone else. Someone else is going to die today, and it isn't you. It isn't you, Menachem, that I know. You can come out, Menachem. Are you all right? No. You know, Grandpa thought... that I shouldn't tell you, that it would only... make you sad. No, I'm glad you told me. Neta'le... What do you like? Because maybe... maybe there's still time? Maybe I can make it for you? Grandma, forget the cake. What does it matter now? I don't know why I mentioned the cake. The cookies were just fine. Yes, Grandpa bought them. I can feel my dog all day. What? My dog, you know. Grandma... That isn't your dog. It's probably the neighbors' dog or something. I know, I know. 'm talking about my dog, Wolfie. Wolfie.. I've had him since I was a baby. Wolfie. A smafU handsome dog. With eyes like... Such beautiful, kind, wise eyes. You never told me about him. He went everywhere with me. To my friends' houses, to school. He never let me leave him behind. Once we went on vacation.. He chased our train for two whole days. Who did? Wolfie, our dog. What do you want to do with the clothes? I dontt know. Well, you don't have to decide now. You know, Neta'le, I wasn't a good mother to your mother. That's okay, she isn't so great either. Scrambled eggs... (also bullshiter) Scrambled eggs? -Scrambled eggs. That's what you used to make me that I liked. Scrambled eggs? -Yes, you put in milk and... - Soda water. Soda water. Yes, there was something special about it. I don't know... I liked it. Scrambled eggs. Go away. Go! Do you know where I keep the iron? Yes, you showed me before. (But I don't know how to use it. I wish I could cry. All day I try to cry, but it just won't come out. Maybe... if we hug... then maybe the tears will come. It was just... just an idea. e don't have to. Come here, Grandma. That helped, didn't it? There's no trick that can help. I'm going upstairs, (also up) I want to rest. Hello? Hi, Mom. Mom...
