The Meadow of Things Yes, hello. - Hello... Oh, it's you. Excuse me, I will be back in a second. Every decade has its own access to heaven. I would have liked to prevent this story. But it happened like this. It was at the beginning of August 1974. The new World Trade Center had produced... ...an oversupply of office space in its neighbourhood. And exactly into that vacuum we moved in. I ate so much Hershey's Chocolate... that I could hardly crawl from under my moskito net. And when the sun shone into my face it felt like a punch. Our landlord regarded us as artists. For him we had just one thing in mind... ...and that was to splash paint on canvas. That hallowed idiocy of expression. The preference we gave to his dirt hole was a sure sign for him... ...that this part of town would boom in the near future. With increasing rentals I will throw them out, such were his thoughts. We dispised the limousines of Mercedes Benz. They looked like armoured scout vehicles. We started to kidnap Mercedes dealers. We hid and tortured them... ...and lived of the ransom we got in exchange for them more often than not. In this mess we were safe. Nobody looked for us here. The German police didn't have the slightest notion. One night a woman wanted to be impregnated by me... ...and stretched out on my improvised bedstead. The next morning she was gone. Later I was told that my son was born on April 30th, 1975. His mother never asked me for a name for him. She didn't even ask for money. My feelings for humans went so far that I was absolutely sure... ...that this little rat of a son would approach me some day... ...and would get everything from me. Simply because he uninhibitedly asked for it. In reality I never set eyes on him... ...until my death on October 9th, 1979. What you saw last was the People's Kitchen. Before that the telex machine. And this here, two storeys under the ground, is the People's Prison. Physiologists say, that septennially all parts of a human body are entirely renewed. And worldwide you can assume... ...that every ninth year a human gets struck dead by a meteor. Show me your tongue. Is it day or is it night? Is it the twentieth or the twenty-first day of my confinement? He murmurs so vaguely. We have to get what he says. It is so highly important. Did you hear that? Next time you take the toilet soap out of your mouth before you tell us something. That's a shame... ...for the entire beach. Wow, you please us so much. This is not the luggage receipt obliged by Article Four of the Hague Protocols in 1955. People are sheded body parts... ...of an eternally dividing society. I put coins under the tongues of my dead friends... ...but I did not comfort them. Already thousands went this way without any comfort. Rotted finally to the dead skeleton whose word for the same description was not to be found The word representing the object on paper whose words are spoken by the object itself, is now no other as well as the other is now no word anymore representing the word that could describe the object existing outside its description Being alive through description it looses its life as a word it becomes an object of the thing and its rotting interests as the object of the thing itself The word for the thing itself is the object itself as a thing to be immediately understood Everybody is exchangeable without exception. The world does not explode just because the edifice of thoughts does not fit anymore... ...into which it has been jammed. It remains totally indifferent to people. As a rug dealer I had been in constant anticipation... ...of a rug design that would acting as an antibody of my brain structure... ...lead to my immediate annihilation. A death I can only dream of, now. The rooms of the past. Therein our ghosts. The ashes of bygone furniture. We controlled each other. I brought a pile of postcards to our office... ...and in full view of the group... ...I had to disclose the motives for the purchase of each card. This one because of its screen dots. The shadows on the iceblocks. The dog on the aslant veranda. Tunnel, bridge and street. Tunnel, bridge and street? Yes. Dirt track. The assembled sky. What was this... Oh yes, the line between their heads. My decisions then were impeached by my comrades. Screen dots? The line between their heads. The line between their heads? Dirt track? - Yes. Dirt track. Shadows on the iceblocks? - Yes. I had kept my pride. We stock Hohner instruments in great quantities. Beginning with the accordion... ...up to the larger electronic instruments. Characteristic of each of them... The parents of my comrades had committed to themselves to not let a German come... ...near them until the end of their lives. Hohner instruments are especially popular with those who play them... ...because it is extremely satisfying not to have to practice for years... We hid my body from their eyes. ...not to be led to the music toilsomely but to delve into it immediately. But that will only be possible for you with one of the German Hohner instruments. Check out the instruments, have them presented to you... A friend was proud of the imprint of a flat-iron... ...that a sculptor had scorched into the skin of her right shoulder blade. You can learn to play each Hohner instrument following the instructions for use by yourself. You don't have to practice for years. - My clothes were made of plastic fibers. You will be surprised by your own progress. Here are three companies... - I scratched myself. ...which can present the Hohner instruments to you... My bones lay on the bent plates of the linoleum. Each of them at the same distance from the center of the earth. ...in Westchester County... Persisting aural pain. ...Yonkers, New York... Rock-solid mattresses. ...National Music Shop... ...570 Bloomfield Avenue... Everything was too hot, too cold... ...and my own temperature an unknown quantity. ...with Franzl Sander, who exclusively plays on Hohner instruments... One thing was clear to me: As far as I was concerned... ...I was kept abreast totally wrong. He is not there. The greatest dealers at the Eastcoast in those days were "The Mamas und the Papas". Their motto was: "Don't call us, we call you." He doesn't pick up the phone. How then to get hold of their stuff? I began to describe my condition. I scribbled designs for small waves that represented the water content of my body... ...on a piece of paper and put the word AIR above it. Artist In Residence... ...finally letting it be and no longer a madman. Pure wishful thinking. And then I ate the lump of opium we had found in a Mercedes 220. The insobriety lasted for several days. You can switch it on and off and write at the same time. It is true that you are a steamrollered plane... ...but in its center the sun shines on unscratched bronchi. After that everything was over and things were worrying again. I only have a vague remembrance. No sound from the city was to be heard. Somewhere a room fire was extinguished. I stopped with my writing. I had babbled sentences which I considered to be time bombs. That was all. I wanted them to be implanted in the back of your head... ...so that they could rise into your face during a doze. In the land that carries the name of the dreamer. Here I met them again, my second and third selves... ...the perverse rug dealer... Woof, woof. Sure, sure. Like the compulsion to put oneself in front of something... ...unscrupulous, everywhere. He is dead, therefore I am dead. ...and the megalomaniacal artist. Water, that could be the waves, too. Waves could be in the water, too. The lack of air. Something means something. Sensitive for the changing of stones. To empty a fountain pen by writing. Living in a bunker, dying in a battle tank. To be all here. He grew pale. So what, be disgusted by it. Only in my mind he is still walking the streets. In the lighting department... ...of a small department store once a big lamp fell down. Like a house riven by grief. Like something that you can still throw away. At the Pacific Ocean. Gigantic garbage cans prove great cleanliness. Learned a lot in skew light. To rise hope in offices. The sidewalk sparkles like the puddles of the past. Since two hours there are new smoke signals. The place without you. Beds... ...rooms... ...houses, streets... ...cities... ...countries... The world without you. Negative space. I began to search for you. It is Winter. I can only guess what happened to your body. I pressed my fingers into your muscles. Your squinted eyes beamed with pleasure. Hey. People began to tell me with whom they had slept. I was so tired that I just as well could have fallen under the table... ...but I listened. On the 14th floor of an office building near Wall Street... ...a stockbroker cocksucking at least fifteen other members... ...of the stock exchange at every lunch break. If somebody says he is suffering from love... ...it is looking funny from the outside. ...I am now in Schwarzenbeck... ...Levis... ...the odds are against them. ...and Gentlemen, from the series "Thousand Houses"... ...you will see today Building Number 883. The IBM building erected in 1965-68 at the East-West-Street... ...symbolizes the punch card used in those days. Nowadays vertical struts have been mounted between the windows... ...to prevent the crashing of the window cleaner's gondola into the facade. Today nobody can recall how a punch card looks like... ...and the building became a memorial of its proportions. Hello. Where the source of things is... ...to that place they must also pass away, according to necessity... ...for they give justice and make reparation to one another... ...for their injustice, according to the arrangement of Time. Entlang dem Brauch Gehören nämlich lassen sie Fug Somit auch Ruch eines dem anderen Im Verwinden des Un-Fugs To whom in love of nature holds communion with her visible forms... ...she speaks a different nature. This building at Domstrasse... ...pathetically represents building styles for offices this side of World War Two. Crouched and creepy, expecting the next bomb attack. Disproportional, currying favour. Half-harted and opportunistically... ...copy catting the architectonical themes of its surrounding. A nuisance for every passerby and by far the ugliest building of the world. Because we were the last tenants in the building the heating was turned off for good. The landlord had speculated quite well. His good noses had served their turn. I made an open fire in the lavatory... ...and was kicked out of the building by the end of the year. As a rent slave I moved to a hotel. There I picked up the old threads. See what daddy had projected with his eyes into landscape. Yes, humans exist... ...to populate outer space. With images of their planet and its continents burnt into their brains... ...as a symbol for homeland people are standing there. With lungs that can bear the oxygen of its toxic atmosphere... ...for about seventy years. An embarrassing fact for all living persons. Even for a speedingly mutating respiration... ...it will take as long as a couple of a million years for our lungs to get used... ...to the conditions of a foreign planet. We knew that nature favours any kind of assimilation... ...and ran through the rain across the street to the Roxy Food Shop. At its langitudinal wall we sat down in a booth for two persons... ...and ordered Number Nine: Edible chicken bones with roasted potatoes. Simultaneously our eyes grasped... ...a posting made obligatory for all restaurants in those days. It read: "First Aid for Choking Victims". On it badly drawn waiters beat on the back of guests... ...whose food had gotten stuck in their throats... ...and dragged them on a coach that had appeared out of nowhere. We laughed at the poster and choked. The splintered chicken bones had gone astray in our windpipes. By coughing and panting we tried... ...to press the air caught in the lungs against them. But the swollen windpipes... ...fixed the bone fragments deep inside. Our attempts to pass new air past the foreign objects... ...into our lungs drooling for oxygen failed... ...but came to attention of the waitress. We pointed with our fingers to the poster but she had forgotten about it. We therefore stopped asking for help... ...and punched each other so hard on our backs... ...that the dishes rattled on the table. Then we put our fingers in our throats. First we disgorged the food that had already entered our stomachs... ...then the bone fragments came off our windpipes and ended up on the plates... ...from which they had started their journey into our bodies. The waitress took the restoration of of an easy-going breathing as a sign ... ...to clear the plates on which the predigested food... now blended in with the untouched. She did that just as friendly as she had served them. We paid and ran back across the street. The linoleum is reflected on the TV screen. ...we repeat today Building Number... The parking garage at Brandstwiete... ...is an attempt to cast oversized flower stems in lilac concrete. I remember quite well the empty space next to the Wurst Palace. The building wants to look pretty, light-footed and playful. In this case, too, the couch would have been more productive... ...than the drawing table. And now, a quarter to six. He is so bloody inaccurate. Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven! Twelve! Again: a quarter to six. That is fine. And now, three minutes past eight. I am ready. He should say his sentence now. This is my twenty-second day... ...as a prisoner of the Fighting Brigade "Bernard Buffet". The headline of the Daily News from October 9th was... ..."Bogus Surgery at the Head". Shit, he again forgot his fodder. My board is cream of the crop. Mr. Federal Chancelor, in case you don't broadcast this sign of my life as a TV-ad... ...my kidnapper will not spare me. You beam again today. Jubileh... If somebody took me hostage I would say... ...I am in no way irreplacable. Come in and bomb the plane... ...take potshots at it with your machine guns. This is the German Television with the news. Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen. Rumania apparently sticks to its guns... ...in its quarrel over gasoline with the other Eastblock nations. The deadline for tourists in Rumania expires today... ...to pay for gasoline with the local currency. Professor Vogue found out in Marsaille from 49 passive homosexuals... ...that eight suffered from phimosis. I don't want this dirty animal to miss one single second. Tell him to lay down facing the earth. The demands have not been met... This is the end. A body who does not know what he wants disrupts the contract between bodies. Words and deeds don't impress you... ...because you are insane. You refuse to give them a meaning. You live in your tiny private world. And this is the only way to invade it. Jump! I would have liked to have a body, too. There is no tourism in life. Slowly it dawns on me what is wrong with the others. All images of the world are passing dreams. Just unstable combinations of atoms. You are a piece of clay that only looks like a breathing bird. Forms are nothing else than mirrors. Figures get beheaded. So, please, excuse me that I was your mirror. All images have to be removed from cloths and pillows. You don't project a moving image of yourself onto your own skin. Nothing simular with what is in the air, on earth, in the water or under the earth. If I want to picture a living thing, I just have to behead and slaughter it... ...and replace it by something else. An animal I draw as a plant, and a plant as a stone. A rose is named granite by me, a horse is wood. I don't copy nature here... ...I like to contradict it. A mere intellectual activity he is fully aware of. It's fun for him. The subway station "Measuring Mountain" is our last stop. The unsuspicious rider who for decades was used to an abstract tile design... ...suddenly comes to the conclusion that abstract art does not exist. The background of the tile design is yellow-orange. In regular distances between them... ...brown mountains pile up from the train tracks... ...to the ceiling of the station. The unconscious of the architect forged ahead here... ...in form of gigantic, stylised piles of shit that swim in piss. All under the name of "Measuring Mountain"... ...a proud proof of efficiency towards his mother. Look, what I have done, so huge and so much. And as a grown-up addition everything nice and neatly tiled. Is he happy now, daddy? In the midst of the empire's metropolis at the 11th floor of a warehouse... ...filling the whole space a shiny truck on which men play. They play to be construction workers, red indians, cowboys, wild boys... ...old boors, baker, dauber, chimney sweeper. You have to love them. There is theoretically and practically no way around it. Or the blacks who withstand longest in the semen smeared cabins. By then the white reason had already reorganized itself... in the brightly lit round of a jerk-off club. Against a general suspicion of colonialism one has to say that, of course, the world essentially belongs to all humans individually. Why should the white man not be allowed to build a hut in black Africa? If you'd say, because he would be beaten to death then, I would understand you. When everything is over you will walk homewards in uncomfortable English shoes... ...stammering "My bed"... ...and throw yourself on a more or less soft pile of blankets and pillows. Hello? Well, let it be. I called from Vancouver. From Canada. A satellite of the United States like West-Germany is one. It is dark and I cannot move anymore. It is light and I sit in the beam of an unbearably ugly lamp. I have withdrawn myself and move from one hotel to another. The rooms of yore roll past me. The chairs, the restaurants. All the food that ever disgusted me. My old comrades will stone me. Disappointed projections and projected disappointments. While it is true that the power pants in the center... ...the satellites are always nagging at the periphery. The clones are dying around me. And I am one of them. A dead albatross is flying above us. There is sand in his stomach. The materialistic method acts as its own soap. Okay, you are obliged to order wine here. Dust on each page. A reconstructed scene with moved furniture. Hands up and don't move. Alkaloids are organic nitrogen compounds... ...being synthesized by plants... ...to make it bearable for them to exist at exactly one place. Opium poppy itself is extremely addicted to drugs. Faces are the opposite of stories. Stories are born when the events are dead. The history of faces goes back to that of animals... ...in whose visages we recognize the structure of our own. The cross formed by the senses. The neverending chain of faces, an infinite variation... ...rising out of the mists of history and extending into nothingness. They mark the outer boarder of projections. Shaping the light and one's view. Love reads in the bones. The portrayed face looks out of its condition into an unknown time. The presence of the past in an inconceivable future. Thus the dead are speaking... ...and the living feel the sensation of being watched by their peers.
