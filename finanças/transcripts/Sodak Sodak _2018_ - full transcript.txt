(Directed by Sam CHOI) (GHOST HOUSE) Honey? Byung-woon? Stop playing games. Honey? Byung-woon? What are you doing there? Cut it out. Please? You're scaring me. Honey? Honey? You heard it, too? (The Whispering) (Good luck on the CSAT! Mil-gok High Seniors) (Test Room 12) Hey! Eun-ha! Mr. Kim wants to see you. Everything seems fine, but this major you chose requires high grades. Choose an easier major. That's best. There's still the essay and interview. Everyone thinks the same. Don't expect much to change with a great essay, just do as I advise. But... You did so well on the practice tests, that was why I expected a lot. What happened to your actual tests? Go back. - Tell Cho Woo-sung to come. - Yes. That fool... Fans of 'Woo-sung's Beautiful Life'! We just got the results for our CSATs! We're live at my high school! Please give us a big hand! We studied hard and we're done! This is my pal, Dong-il. What are you doing, man? Can't you tell? The civil service exam? You're studying for another exam right after CSAT, duh? 4 years at a low ranked college won't get me a good job. I'd rather become a civil... I don't need your lame excuses after you ruined your CSAT. - They say you're practical. - Get lost. Hae-guk! Wait! Jung-yoon! Jung-yoon! Oh! Sorry! You should pay me if you want to shoot. I have copyrights. You mean portrait rights? You idiot... Whatever! It's okay as long as you understood. Right. Voted the most beautiful girl at Mil-gok High, meet Jung-yoon! Could you please tell the folks the secret to your beauty? Please? Well, constant good skin care and lots of sleep? Did you hear that? Unbelievable, isn't it? She slept like crazy during the CSAT period! She doesn't care about going to college for her good skin care! Give her a hand, folks! I'll kill you! Min-woo! Good looking, isn't he? What's this? - Smile, will ya? - What the? Guys. Do you believe in God, folks? I don't! Why? Look at him! He's damn handsome! And he can dance and sing! And most importantly, a big cobra! It's really big! Why? It's just not fair! Right? Eun-ha is the top student in our class. How about an interview? Eun-ha always has her cool as the smartest student. I'm sorry, but could you just go? Right. Sorry. My bad. But I never give up. Eun-ha? What's done is done. You can't do anything about it. Let's change the plan. Apply to 3 other schools. I'm sorry. It's not over. From now on, maintaining the good condition will be a key. Don't slack off because others stop studying. Just find your good pace and keep it up. You can do it well. Okay? Okay. Where's the list of college admission cut-offs? Y – Y1 = M (X – X1)... Do you still hear Ji-eun's voice? Don't ask. Hey. Are you okay? About what? You know. Since the exam is over, we should watch movies or take a trip somewhere far. Or go out on blind dates. Blind dates? I have no time to date. I bombed the CSAT. If you bombed it, what about me? You'll debut as a singer soon. You're great at singing and dancing. But I'm not. The CSAT was all I had. All I can do is study, but I ruined it like a fool. Let's go home. Don't go weak because you tripped once. You'll get back up. Don't act like it's the end of the world. Whatever, speak for yourself! Don't lecture me. Why you little twerp! Why you big pole! (Quiet! CIVIL SERVICE) It was so damn real. it was exactly the same with what I watched yesterday. What's it about? This beautiful woman in all of Asia... Forget it. Jung-yoon. I'm all out of suggestions for you to watch. What do you mean? You like them too hot and intense. I can't keep up with you. That's nothing. Scary. What a scary woman. Hey, pal. Could you be quiet? You speak too loud as I can hear you even with my earplugs on. Please keep it down. Woo-sung, please? Why are you talking like a nerd? You sound like an AI. Hey. Stop bothering Dong-il when he's studying. What's with them? Are you curious? Forget it. Good! Go past the defense! Pass! Pass! Hey, hey! Oh! Goal! How'd you score? Min-woo! You said you're good at this! It's because I was teaching you. Of course, I'm good! Yeah, right! Let's play for real, then. Are you crying? Crying that you lost? I'm not crying! Come on! Shit! Why's it so damn loud! Hey! Think you own this place? Kids these days are so rude! They have no manners whatsoever! Damn it! Shouldn't you quiet kids down if they're noisy like that? Why are you just watching them? I found an awesome place! Hae-guk! Hurry up! Hurry! Geeze! What's up with you guys? We should ask the same thing. Min-woo. We're running away for the day. Come with us? What? You selfish bastard! How can girls tell what's under there? - Hey! - That hurts! Why not me? Go look in the mirror! You'll see why. I'm not Snow White! What the hell? Eun-ha. You bombed the CSAT? Why don't you study for the civil service exam with me? Don't bring that up again! - Why not? - Shut up! What did I say? I'm just telling her to face reality. Hear me out. Going to a mediocre college won't get you a job. So spend the time wisely and... Damn little punks go around in a peck! Hey, internet cafe! Are you following me to keep bothering me? Live quietly, little twerps! What did I do? Why do you yell at me? - What? - Mister! You could've ignored us and left. Why open the window and nag us? What did you just say? How dare you! I'm sorry, sir. If you don't want to study, do something productive! What will you become in he future? - I'll be a civil servant. - What? To become a civil servant... Come here! Why you! Run! What the hell? What's this? I wanted to have fun like crazy after the CSAT. But this sucks! It's the same old PC room, karaoke, or coffee shops. Playing pool with guys. If there are girls, maybe go bowling. I'm hungry. Let's go eat some meat. How about going to the sea? The sea? Min-woo! What's this? She's my Facebook friend. She posted pics from Gyeongpo Beach. It's so pretty! It snowed there already? A winter beach always looks awesome. We should take a trip together before we graduate and get busy again for several exams. It's our last winter as minors. If we just waste it like this, we'll regret it later. What do you think, Min-woo? What about you? Do you want to go? Well, I think... How do we get there? By bus? Your mom's daycare van! Let's take that. Are you insane? I can't drive that on the highway! Why not? I think you can. Well, I am a good driver. Great! That's perfect! Dong-il has his license. No problem! - Okay? Hae-guk? you in? - Barbecue, too? Okay! Min-woo! You're in, right? You can't ditch us. - Let's go! - Come on! Let's go! Just a day or two should be fine, right? I've got to start preparing for the school interviews. Too bad she can't go even if she wants to. Stop bothering her by pushing her to go. Right, Eun-ha? Eun-ha? Guys! Look! Isn't it pretty? I want to go there! Look! - The trip sounds fun! - I'm excited. Let's take pictures! Eun-ha. Can't you just come with us? It's not too late to join us. Snap out of it. What trip... (JI-EUN & EUN-HA'S DIARY) ('Thanks for always listening to me') ('Let's go to an amusement park!') If you ditch me again, I'll be mad. Please? It's my last wish? Forget it. Nevermind. How can you turn down your best friend? Skipping one day won't bring down your grades. You're so mean. I'll go by myself. ('And so, Ji-eun flew away like a butterfly') I shouldn't have let you go that way... Speed up, man! There's no car around! Then you drive! You don't have your licenses! You're all talk! What does that have to do with this? You're asking for it! No! Stop it! Hey, guys! Stop it already, seriously! Ready for the bomb? - No! Mom will kill me! - One, two, three! Stop it! Cut it out! When the hell did Mom upgrade the GPS? Hey. Woo-sung! Woo-sung! Damn it. Min-woo? Why aren't there any signs on this road? Hey! Woo-sung! Just follow the GPS. Don't be stupid. I'm cold. Let's go. Shit. It should be right here. Let's try going this way. Dong-il! Are you okay? You drove for many hours. Don't go. What's wrong? Had a nightmare? How is this my fault? Obviously, this isn't the way. Use your head! Will you die if the GPS says to? You told me to just follow it! You said it, didn't you? Why! What? That's insane. You said it! Jung-yoon. People make mistakes. Accept it. And learn from it, okay? Don't put the blame on me! Hey! What's wrong? He's being weird! I'm not driving! I can't drive like this! I won't! Sensitive bastard! Guys! What? There's a cave! And an amusement park! Wow! Let's ride the Viking! He's taking our picture! The john is that way. - Hae-guk! - Okay. What's your secret code? - 6456. - 6... 4... 5... 6. Here I go. No, Eun-ha! You can't stay here. Get out of here now! Eun-ha! Hurry! Get out! Hold on, Jung-yoon. Wait until I become a civil servant! Hey, Woo-sung! If you're joking, I'll kill you! We must go to the end. Let's get out already. I'm scared. Hey, stop it. It's right there. Look. What are you doing? Did you hear that sound? Sound? What sound It sounded like someone talking. What are you two doing? Damn. You scared me. 'Ghost House'? I didn't know something like this was here. You two look suspicious. Why do you two keep going off together? Eun-ha. Let's go. What? Hey! Wait up! Who said you can come in here! I'm sorry, ma'am. We got lost. What did you touch? What did you touch! Granny? Are you the owner here? If you are, then we'll apologize. But you don't look the part by looking at what you're wearing. If you're being nosy, don't mind us. We're leaving now. Let's go, guys. Let's get out of here. If you got lost, then find your way and go. We were just leaving. What did you touch? Stop! 20 years ago, Mr. Choi of Jung-ju here wanted to build an amusement park. But it turned out, the building site was a portal for ghosts to travel through. This is no place for the living! Get out! You're opening the ghost portal! You are calling the dead! What do you mean? He used the rumours and built it as a haunted theme park where the real ghosts appear. His plan worked so well, and the ghost house was a huge success. He played on people's curiosity to see if ghosts exist and if them can really see there. But the recession hit him hard. What was worse was, everything he owned went bankrupt. Choi lost his mind. Then he came up with an idea when he went crazy. If someone dies in the haunted house where real ghosts are, he thought it would sell tickets again. He hoped people would come again. Then what happened? What do you think? He hit and killed his wife and daughter with a hammer, and even killed himself. The end! Where'd you hear that? Is it true? You believe it? Wait! Look! Choi and his family committed suicide here! So? Why bring that up now? Nice question. Min-woo? You saw the entrance. Didn't you feel it? It looked really odd. Feel what? That my show 'Woo-sung's Beautiful Life' is about to be a huge hit! What the hell are you talking about? Listen. We spend a night at a haunted place where the real ghosts appear and a family died 20 years ago! Wouldn't that make a great show? With some more stories, it'll be a legend! What about the pension we booked? Even if we go now, we'll get there too late. And it'll be hard to drive in the dark. Right! Driving by the sea at night is dangerous! Thanks, buddy. It's not to help you, man. I just don't want to drive. Okay! Hurry up! How do we pose? What do you want? Just do whatever! One, two, three! Whoa! I knew this would be gold! - Hae-guk! - Hey. Nice, Hae-guk! You're well prepared! Better safe than worry, right? 'Worry'? Why'd you pack that? Weren't we supposed to go to pension? Shut up, idiot. - We don't have time. Let's go! - Go, go! Be careful. I don't like this shit. - Gosh! - Geeze! What the hell? Enough with the appetizers! Let's get down to the nitty gritty! Sir, get up! Get up, man! How could a man this cowardly? Chicken. Hurry up! Geeze! Seriously. Let go! Hurry. Come on! Let's go, guys. Move, people. That was cool. - Geez! - What are you doing? It's not what you said! Why do we have to do this? You said you'd help. Since you promised, let's do this right, okay? It's easy. Dong-il, When I give you a sign, just pound on the door. Let's hear you scream. - Good. - Okay? You're asking us to help you air a rigged show? A rigged show? I can't do that. Come on. What are friends for? Help me out this once? If I hit it big, I'll owe you for life. But why only us? Why not Min-woo and the girls? Why only us? That's scary! You loser! They're promoting the show on Instagram for me now! Act real, okay? Help me out just once? Come on! What's taking so long? Eun-ha? Are you scared? Tell me your older brother. I'll take care of you. You're not older. Stop acting up. Hey. You were born in August and I was in May I'm three months older than you. Call me oppa. What's with you? Say it. Since I was born in April, I'm one month older than you. Then call me nuna. Say nuna. What the hell was that? All set? It's really simple. Just act really surprised, scared, and you never knew, okay? How do I look? I'm way better in person. Right? Whatever. Break a leg! Let's go. Focus. It must be the wind. It's okay. Jung-yoon, let's go. Come on! - Jung-yoon, did you shave? - Shut up. Hey. Eun-ha? What are you doing? Do your role right, okay? If you alone look the other way when the other look this way, it doesn't make sense. - Please? - Okay. Guys. Let's do it again, okay? Act really surprised, scared and you never knew. What the hell is it now? Sorry. I need to take this call. - What? - Let's go in first. - But the show has just started! - Wait for me! She's stressing me out. Why do you like her? Our simple-headed Jung-yoon is way better, right? What's with you all of a sudden? Think everything's done after the CSAT? You bombed it! How could you think of playing? I'm sorry. You can play all you want when you go to college later. Can't you wait till then? Or do you want to go to a country college and play with bums? Wake up, Eun-ha! You can't slack off like this! Mom! Enough already! I'm human, too. Am I nothing because I bombed the test? It's killing me, you know! I just want to take a break! Is that so bad? Eun-ha get out now! Don't listen. How'd you come in here? - Mommy... - Mommy? You came with your mom? I don't know where she is. Where did she go? Be careful. This place rocks! Unbelievable! What's this? Who lit all the candles? It's so scary! Let's get out of here. We feel something dark and evil here, folks. I'm scared. I'm scared! Thank you for sponsoring! I love you forever! Reaction? That's impossible right now. What the hell? Mom told be to be careful today. Let's get ourselves together! Guys! what the! look at this pig. Damn, what's this? What's moving in the pig's nose? Is it alive? This is far out! What the hell is this? Guys! Are they coming or not? I can hardly breathe! Let's go. Min-woo! Back online! What is it? I thought I heard Eun-ha's voice. Maybe you heard wrong. I didn't hear anything. Eun-ha! We're going in first! She heard us. Let's go! Hurry, hurry! Come! Come on. - Hello, folks! - Hi! Min-woo! Come on! - Hello? - What? - Eun-ha, where are you? - I'm still here. Where? Your mom went there? [VIU Ver] -♥ Ruo Xi ♥- 112. May I help you? A little girl lost her parents. Where are you calling from? An abandoned amusement park. It says Jung-ju Land. Could you speak up, please? It's too loud around you. I can't hear you. Could you tell people around you to quiet down? Pardon? What do you mean? What is it? I don't know. People rambling on each other and making weird noises. I think that was a prank call. Oh shit! Folks! Can you feel the legend here? It's filled with blood and signs of torture here. Let's look inside the tub. Isn't it just horrendous? You want me to touch it? Come on! Don't all agree! The girl? Jung-yoon? I'll do it. A man should do something like that, right? Thanks Min-woo. - Just poke like this? - Yes! Geeze! You scared me! Damn, what's taking them so long? It's too suffocating here. What's so fun? Don't try to scare me. Stop or I'll get mad at you. Wow! Woah! This is insane! Hurry up! Woah! This is awesome! I'm topping the chart! Can you see the number? Nice! Awesome! Congrats, man. My legs hurt. Can we stop now? No way! How can you tell me to stop with a rave response like this? We have to strike while the iron is hot! Strike the iron! Strike the iron! Hurry up! Hurry! Come on! See this, folks? It's made to look like a cemetery. Doesn't it look like something will jump out any minute? I heard something. Did you? Yes! I hear it there. Me too! I hear it. Hold on. The coffin's lid is moving! Oh! Did you see that? - Yes! - I think it moved! Folks! What do we do now? Check it out or run away? I'm exhausted. What was that? Hey. What the hell! Guys! Guys! Why is it going down? - Woo-sung! I'll kill you! - You see this? Hey. Did you plan that? No! Move! Hey, Dong-il! Come on! Help me here! Give me a hand here! Hey! Woo-sung! Do something about it! Get me back up now! Oh no! Hold on, Dong-il! Are you okay, Dong-il? Woo-sung! Jo Woo-sung! I'm dying here! Get me out of here! It's so stuffy in here. What's that? Min-woo? Woo-sung? Guys! Dong-il! Joo Dong-il! It's all Woo-sung's fault! It's all because of him! Woo-sung! Snap to it! Is your phone working? What do we do now? Go and find Dong-il! That's what! But where? It's got dropped to the bottom. We heard the coffin hit the ground. Let's go down and find. Wait! What are you doing? I got an idea. Let's say it was a prank and get back on the air. Damned bastard! How can you say that at a time like this? Why'd you hit me, Min-woo? Woo-sung, look. When you did stupid stuff, I thought it was to make us laugh. But prank? All you think about is your stupid show at this moment? What did I do wrong? You were in it, too! Just keep living like that, you selfish bastard. Min-woo wait! What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do! It's not rigged! Hey! Seems like there's nothing here. Who says I'm scared? I'm just cold. That's it. What? You saw something move? Holy shit! You saw that move? Okay. Hey. Did you move? Didn't you hear me? No! I said this is the real deal! I was going to say it was a prank at the end, but... You can see me? What the hell? How old are you? Nine? Seven? Seven, huh? Just like Eun-sung. Who? My little brother. He's so cute. Ignore the voice. Don't listen to that. What? Ignore the voices. Don't listen to the voices. If you do... They'll think you're like them. Mommy? What are you doing? Sis! Sis! Don't go! Let's play hide-and-seek. Ready or not, here I come! Folks? I'm trapped! Help! Someone report this, please? Please say something... Legend... It's okay. They're scared to come in here. Who are you? Please! Don't kill me! Please don't kill me! Calm down. You're okay. Look at me. It's okay. We'll be fine. Get yourself together. Listen to me carefully. You must stay focused to make it out of here alive. Got it? I got stuck in here just like you so I don't know much. The only thing I know is that this whole place is filled with ghosts. They don't even know they're dead. So the story was true? The ghost portal will soon close. We need to get out now. When this stops, no one can get out. Even the living can't get out. We need find the exit first. Let's go! Wait! My friends are here, too. I have to go out with them. But you could die! Fine. Let's look for your friends first. From now on, don't talk to the dead.

We may be too late already. No. Snap out of it! We could all get killed! Eun-ha! Are you okay? Are you hurt? I'm fine. Let's get out of here. Where is everybody? Dong-il is dead. I don't know about the others. Why didn't you come like you said? When did I say that? On the phone! But I was with this lady. Lady? What's wrong? What? Who are you talking about? This lady. Eun-ha! Hurry! There's no time! - Eun-ha? Your hand... - Wait. What's with you? Where's the exit? Hey. Who the hell are you talking to? I get it now. Eun-ha? What's wrong? Huh? Snap out of it!
