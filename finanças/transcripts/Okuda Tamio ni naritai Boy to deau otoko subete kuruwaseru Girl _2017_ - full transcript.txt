I first took notice of him on a TV music program. A casually-dressed man among groups like SMAP and Mr. Children. When the host said, Your jeans are stained... he gave an unfazed response. I spilled ramen broth on them. His nonchalant attitude struck me as really cool. I was in junior high at the time. Tamio Okuda has been my hero ever since. Always in jeans and yet dignified... he had fun, but he sure wrote seriously good music. To read up on him, I got into rock magazines. And decided to become an editor. But not to be trendy or fashionable, or for girls or money. That's all crap. No, I've got my own single-minded direction and I won't be swayed. And I'm going to make it there... hopefully. What music do you like, Koroki? Koroki? Are you listening? This is YOUR welcome party. Don't space out. - Sorry. - Who do you like? Earth to Koroki, what music artists? You look like a music fan. Music, huh? Well, let me see - Tamio... - Did you see D'Angelo, Yoshizumi? I sure did. It was awesome! I sacrificed work for it. Well I went and saw The Internet. - At the Liquidroom? - They killed. Have you heard Seven Bells' last album? They based it on a legacy Benjamin track. - No way. - How moving. So who do you like, Koroki? Yes, well... I like Tamio Okuda. Yeah, he's good. I loved Unicorn in middle school. Saw them on TV. So nostalgic. - See You in My Dreams. - Working Male! No, it's Working Man. Working Man. I love him, too... Tamio Okuda. Japanese music, Chief? Hey, good music is good music, whether domestic or global. Our editorial stance. I've got 07 Cristal Ros?. - Seriously? - You're breaking that out? I interviewed him once... Okuda. Around his solo debut. When was that? 1994! - The song? - For Love! Wow, you should be on a quiz show. But it was hard getting him to talk. I've heard that, too. He never speaks his heart. I can explain. He's reticent, but you can sense his will. When he broke up the band and went solo... he displayed attitude towards the media. Japan didn't have musicians like that. He was promising. Anyway, Koroki... welcome to Malet Magazine. Thank you. A toast to his success. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Yum! - Our Chief Editor's a genius. What a relief. I was worried when assigned to a lifestyle magazine. I feared I didn't have the sense of style. But I can work for this Chief Editor. Still, I haven't a clue about champagne. Just what is ros?? Tastes weird. I'd prefer soba from a noodle stand. Right! I'm going to become a man and an editor in the spirit of Tamio Okuda! Welcome. Tempura soba - Soba. - Coming right up. Now that's good. - Sorry. - Oh, good morning. The train was stopped. - Oh no. - Shall we? I'm off to London. Can you handle a ladies' brand tie-up? Meet with their PR? The deal's basically done. I just need you for the photo shoot. What did you do before? Gadgets and appliances, but tie-ups were common. Mr. Yoshizumi! Hello! Tamio Boy Tornado Girl Tornado Girl On location in the morning and studio after lunch? Yes, I found the perfect skating rink. That's perfect. I hoped to avoid plain street photos. Wow... amazingly cute. Are all women in the fashion press this cute? I injured myself. How bad? Two stitches. Oh no. Will it leave a mark? Yeah, so anyway... Koroki will be at the shoot. He'll cover for me. I appreciate it. Groovy. What? I mean, I'm looking forward to it. Groovy? Really? You're very funny, Mr. Koroki. Sorry. Listen, about the final page... My boss, Ms. Eto... wants to include an essay to look less like a tie-up. Uh-oh. Sorry, you know how she is. Her boss is very headstrong. She wants Haruki Murakami or Naoki Matayoshi to write it. But that's obviously impossible. What'll I do? I guess it wouldn't hurt to try. I can try to make them an offer. Really? I can ask around to editors I know. It's worth a gamble. Mr. Koroki, you're amazing. Not at all... Really? What was that about? You can't get Haruki Murakami. No, but maybe Matayoshi through his agent. I'll give it a shot. You want to impress her, huh? I get it. She's very cute. Queen of the press corps. - She is? - Yeah. A regular in magazines. Take a look. But she's a dangerous type to go after. I mean, she's celebrity dating level. No doubt. But you never know. You're handsome. A talented magazine editor and hot PR agent couple is highly possible. Stop. You'll make me blush. I need you to visit a writer. A friend of Akari's boss who writes captions and credits. Sure. Yo, I'm writer Shu Koda. How old are you? 33. 33? You serious? That means I've been a writer since you were in grade school. But age doesn't matter in this business. It's all about sense. If you've got that, you'll survive. Anyway... glad to have you on our team. I'm doing Tatsunori Hara, Giants' former manager. So this is a tie-up with Eto's joint? Yes, I've got it right here. Ms. Eto has sure grown into a bigwig. Here, pure Meguro Ward tap water. Drink up. Malet... Malet. This is a women's magazine. I don't really do those. It's not a women's magazine. It's a lifestyle mag. Mostly women readers, right? True. It's the readers who do the categorizing, not the creators. You company folks don't really get that. Freelancers like me are in tune with the street. Hmm. You're thinking, Japan doesn't have 2 street, right? I wasn't. - You were. - I wasn't. That's because you guys weren't there on the street to know! An old Zeebra quote from Quick Japan magazine. You don't know? The thing is I'm really busy right now. But I'll make an exception. I've known Eto a long time. I really appreciate this. No sweat. It's all right. It's all groovy, baby! Old, huh? I've found new appreciation for the Seventies. The period had soul. Know what I mean? What's this all about here? Ms. Eto wants an essay by a writer. I'll do it while I'm at it. The client wants the likes of Murakami or Matayoshi. It's a fashion page. You need a writer who knows fashion. Yes, but... Does Haruki Murakami know fashion? Before that, let me ask you, Koroki. Do you know fashion? I'll need to ask the client. It's all groovy. Do-do-do-do-don't worry! I'll talk to Eto and convince her. Is that all right? It's all groovy! 400 words? I've even got a topic. Great. So how does it look? Pretty nice, huh? It's amazingly elegant! And I love all the natural light streaming in. Are you a sunny weather guy, Mr. Koroki? Perhaps I am. You seem like a sunny weather guy. I always bring rain. Last year's spring-summer shoot was a constant downpour. But not this year. I'm glad. Wow, this is beautiful! I'm glad we went with Laura as the model. She's so cute. And Mr. Yamamoto's photos are to die for! He really nails it. The fur detail is even visible. Amazing. Very cute. Nice facial expressions, too. Oh, that reminds me! What? The essay. Progress? Didn't Ms. Eto tell you? Mr. Koda wants to write it. He said he'd talk to your boss about it. Wait, you hadn't heard? What do you mean? I've heard nothing. Well... um... At our last meeting, I clearly asked for a famous writer, didn't I? Yes. Ms. Eto only uses Mr. Koda because he's an old friend. That's why she asks him for captions. Signing off on that without consulting me first is extremely upsetting. I apologize. I know you're still getting your bearings but... Mr. Yoshizumi would've never done that. I'm sorry. Oh, thank you! Man, did I blow it. I feel like a failure. Now Akari thinks I'm totally useless. Why can't I be laid back, but deliver when it counts like Tamio does? Crap! Why didn't I consult her first? No, it's all that stupid writer's fault! Yeah. Did you read my essay, Koroki? - Sorry? - What do you mean, Sorry? Come on, man! You're an editor. Check your mail anytime, anywhere. I'll look now. You finished it already? Geniuses work quickly. Hurry and read it! Okay, hold on. Shibuya's Dead! Rethinking art theater closings and the Seventies Well? Edgy, huh? I felt the passion, man. I also did the layout... couldn't rust your tastes. Like the handwritten look? 3,000 words is okay, right? You need to ask Ms. Eto... You're editor. That's your job. But you said... Don't be an idiot. I only wrote it because you asked me to. What connection does the tie-up page... have with Shibuya, art theaters or the Seventies? All the better! It's fun! It's your job to convince them. I can't print it without the client's okay. Are you an editor or not? We're not here just to make their ads. While we satisfy the client's needs... we also infuse our vision and passion. What do you mean we? Look, I already wrote it, so you'd better print it. I cannot. What? I'm sorry I wasn't clear enough, but I've done this for 10 years. And in no way does this meet the level needed for Malet. It's not going in! Hello? I see. That's your attitude? Oh come on. Don't diss the street! He's bonkers. - Good morning. - Morning. Good morning! Good morning. Morning. First, I need to apologize politely to Akari. Then tell her my candidates for writers. I'll be calm, composed, humorous and display problem-solving skills. Call from Ms. Amami of Goff in & King. What? Hi, sorry for yesterday... What did you say to Mr. Koda? Both of our firms are being badly trolled online. What? On some summary website. What're you going to do? Hold on a second. Malet abuse of freelance writers No way. What is this? It's flaming, right? He even names us. The company's all in an uproar. Oh my God. I need to ask you to fix this mess. Until then, there's a freeze on the tie-up. No, wait! What's wrong? This here... take a look. This looks bad. Are we being flamed? Looks that way. I am so sorry! My first project and this. What do I do? That's okay. Just ignore it. It happens a lot. But what about...? A lot of freelancers are unstable. They feel victimized and lash out like this. It'll be gone in 3 days time. No doubt. I do need to make an apology visit to Goff in, but... think nothing of it. What will you take them as a gift? Sweets from Toraya always do the trick. Too typical. Mizuho bean cakes should do. I prefer the Gunrindo brand. Yoku Moku cigare cookies would be bold. That's brilliant! Don't worry about it. That idiot Koda is always coming here begging me to give him work. With methods like that, he causes trouble for everyone. Maybe this will purge us of him. Sorry for your trouble... um... Mr... - Koroki. - Koroki, yes. No, I should be the one apologizing. We'll make up for it with more work. - Right? - Yes. I look forward to it. These Yoku Moku cookies are sick. Eat up! You too, Akari! Any weekend hobbies? I've really gotten into smoking food. Are you serious? My smoked meats kill. Men go nuts. Smoked meats? Don't you know anything? It's the smell. - You're lying. - I'm not! I've smelt it myself. Will you forgive me? I was so terribly rude to you. No, I should've been more mindful. Please don't apologize. I didn't know Mr. Koda was such a pain. But you really laid into him, didn't you? I wouldn't say that. I merely tried to set him straight. Wow, you don't seem to be the type to do that at all. It's very impressive. No... absolutely not. This may come out sounding a little strange, but... if it led to my seeing you again, then I'm glad. Why? We can always find time to eat. In that case... I promise a great magazine spread. But when it's all done... We'll celebrate. Seriously? I'd love that. Your phone's been beeping non-stop. My boyfriend. Shouldn't you get that? He's prone to domestic abuse. What? It's been troubling me. Do you mean... he's violent with you? No, he doesn't hit me or anything. But I feel confined. If he doesn't hear from me constantly, he calls incessantly. Then when we meet, he grills me and accuses me of cheating. He's broken 3 of my iPhones. The other day, he pulled a knife on me. What? He says I have a face men like. And says I invite them with my eyes. That's not my intention at all. But what can I say in my defense? So I end up just crying all the time. What? I won't stand for that! I can't bear the thought of you having to endure such pain. I would never subject you to that. Please go out with me! I promise to protect you! Mr. Koroki? Boyfriend. Huh? Are you my boyfriend? You bet. You're funny. Good morning! - Morning! - Good morning. Yes, it is, Mr. Yoshizumi. You're so chipper. Am I? Hadn't noticed. How was London? It was a nightmare. The coordinator was useless. That's awful. I heard you had some trouble. The Goff in & King tie-up. No, it was fine. I got Mariko Yamauchi to write the essay. - Good choice. - Yup. Was Ms. Amami okay? I have some news about that, actually. What is it? Well, the thing is... me and Ms. Amami sort of started... seeing each other. I mean, we're an item. There, I said it. It's a bit embarrassing but can you believe it? What? Whatever. Let's see. You're a real piece of work! Don't play dumb with me! I just heard everything! What do you think you're doing? You're not getting away with this crap! I'll kill you! What? No, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please! I can't live without you, Akari! Why Koroki of all people? I'm going to quit my job and kill myself. You want me to die? I will What the Hell? Hey Koroki, what was that? I don't know. What's eating him, I wonder? Done? Want to get dinner? Good night. Good night. Sorry to pester, but I'm worried. Call me. Oh come on. Okay, calm down. Be cool. I can't come to the phone right now... Which is it, me or Koroki? It's you. Please leave a message. It's me, Koroki. What are you doing? We promised we'd call each other! What's going on? Just call me, okay? Good morning! Yeah. This is Koroki of Malet calling. Is Ms. Amami there? Hello? It's me, Koroki. Oh, good morning. No, it's not. What happened last night? I'm with a client right now. Do you know how worried I was about you? I'm sorry. I'm a little occupied. Didn't you even look at your texts? And why not? Tell me why. Why? Why? Why? Don't shout. You're scaring me. What? Thank you for calling. Oh no. No, no, no, no, not Are we breaking up? I can't let that happen! I can't. Calling now would be bad. I'll text her on LINE and apologize. No wait. Texting her may have the reverse effect. I was angry, but only because I was worried about her. I need to act nonplussed. Show yourself as forgiving, cool-headed and calm. Throw in some light humor and keep it short. That's it. Good night. Sorry. I shouldn't be waiting like a stalker, I know. - But I... - Not here. Of course. There's a place I want to go. Sure. You left your iPhone at work? I was going to call you from work in the morning. Then you called. So that explains it. I hate people who get angry. Gosh, I'm so sorry. Who makes a call like that at work? No one. Did you think how I felt at all? No. Do that again and I'll really be angry. So be careful. Understood. I'm sorry. Then I forgive you. Excuse me! Thank God. But wait, did I do anything that awful? I bet Tamio doesn't lose his cool with a girl like Akari. It slides off him. I'm a small man. I need to be more like Tamio. - Stop it. - Ouch. Don't look so injured. You make me out like a monster. No, no, no. Absolutely not. But just tell me about Mr. Yoshizumi... Who is my boyfriend now? That would be me. There's no work tomorrow. I can spend the night. I love you. I really love you. I love you, Koroki. And only you, Koroki. With all my heart. And soul. For our Beauty or Temptress feature... we should go with another big tie-up. The client wants to use regular girls. No models? Nope. Not that we have any. Shop girls are iffy. How about PR? How about that girl at Goff in & King you worked with? Who? Ms. Amami? She'd be perfect. Yeah, I like her. Cute as a button but a viper tongue. She's a blast at all-girls dinners! Takes total command. Total command. Doesn't Eto have a soul vibe going? - Your boss? - Yeah. You think so? When I first met her, I felt like I was talking to James Brown. Could be. She does this thing. Like this. Hey yeah! That's her! And she always says sick for delicious. It's weird. She says it with a Get up! look on her face. That's totally James Brown! Wait, like what? Get up! Exactly! That's her to a tee! - With a mike. - Get up! Get up! Could you ask her, Koroki? Yes, of course. Yoshizumi is taking a break from work for a while. What? Why? I don't really know. But he'll take his paid vacation days, and we'll see from there. Can you step in, Koroki? Yes. What regular feature did he have? The Mikami column. It's all yours. Careful. Mikami's a deathly slow writer. You're kidding. Makino had her before. She never meets a deadline. It gets real close. But her writing quality is undeniable. For sales, she's our only sure thing. Once with only her illustration left to submit, she vanished for 4 days. It stopped my period. How bad is she? About next month's column... I'm sorry to be late again this month. I tell myself every month I'll do better, and then something major happens. Like a diarrhea outbreak with my cats. Or the Bundesliga season kicks off with a Schalke match. Where Leroy San?, a darling 19-year-old, starts... and embraces Atsuto Uchida as they combine for a goal. More than just teammates? Could he be playing for the other side now? Once I get caught in a fantasy, it's hard to return. But these are all nothing but excuses! Just kill me now! Break out the machete! Lop off my head with a clean blow! In this way, I'm sure to inconvenience you on a monthly basis. I'm at your service, cat pee notwithstanding. I love Ms. Mikami's column. You do? She's got lots of fans in my office. That popular, huh? Become pals with her. I'd love to get 2 drink with her sometime. I don't know about that. She's a very eccentric person. I can't see you two hitting it off. What does that mean? Do you know me that well? No, just think your personalities are very different. What is my personality? Well, you're my girl, for one thing. You've got to be joking. This is a very fancy store. We ran a feature about selective, organic markets like this. 1,000 yen for a radish? No way! Do you always shop here? I do. It tastes better and I can trust where it comes from. Don't you check sources? Not really. My focus is more on price. Hmm, we don't seem that compatible, you and I. I want to be sure I eat well every day. Well, so do ll. Caring little for source equates with caring for people. That's not true. How do I put this? I want to support all Japanese farms. I mean, they spend their days... groveling in the dirt... That's the most insensitive thing I've ever heard! What? Come on. Sorry. We'll be back. You got it all wrong! Lower your voice! Sorry, sorry. I'm going. Not to my place? Nope. Not again. Why? What're you doing here? You two are dating? Yes. Way to go. Please keep it mum from Malet staff. Actually, she requested that. She's got you whipped. But I remember feeling like that myself. You've experienced this? Of course. Around your age, too. She'd go from cold as ice to affectionate as a kitten. Exactly. She really was just like a cat. What happened with you and her? One day, she just vanished on me. 2 years later, I ran into her in Paris while on assignment. - No way! - Yeah. Frankly, I just caught a glimpse of her. She was walking arm-in-arm with a French guy. Ouch. He was dapper. I swear he looked just like Serge Gainsbourg. I saw him pass his cigarette to her. I wasn't going to compete with that. I think I understand. But I'm grateful to her. You are? Seeing that lit a flame in my belly. It's immature, but I thought I'll show her. I went and launched Malet. I worked my butt off starting my own magazine. Chalk it up to being in my prime. Pardon me for asking but you're not married, are you? Nope. Done with romance? That's all finished with me, yes. Here's your roast beef, Sir. Wow, that looks amazing. - Listen. - Yes? How about a cat feature? You mean in Malet? They sell magazines... cats. Sales wants more popular features. Circulation's down these past few years. With the right angle, it's not outside our wheelhouse. I see. Am I being dorky? No, no, no. Of course not. I think we can do it. Then maybe I'll give it to you. Great! I'll get right on it. Cats. - Eat. - Yes. The cat has returned. Sorry. I was out of line. Can I come over? Hurry on home. Thank you! Hey. Hmm? Do you like cats? Yes, I do. Why do you ask? We're going to be doing a cat feature in Malet. What, you are? Finally? What do you mean? I was wondering when they'd get to it. It's a guaranteed seller. Really? It's that sure? Our cat-themed dresses and cut-and-sewn all sold out this year. I had no idea it was so popular. Chief Editor put me in charge. That's incredible! Whenever I talk to him, he brings out incredible motivation in me. I've never had a boss whom I respected this much. Finally, a good mentor. He's amazing. What else did you talk to him about? Ooh, I just love you! I do, I do, I do! I love you! I love you! I love you! What is this? Some vandalizing kids? No, someone hit this hard. Maybe drunk. Wait a second. Is that blood? Oh my God. This is scary. Yeah. I should tell the landlord. Good idea. I'm on a business trip this weekend. Really? Where to? Kyoto for a new store opening. Sounds nice. - Want to come? - Huh? It'll be fun. Come on. I work on Saturday, but Sunday's free. Are you sure? Do you have work? Let's see. Manuscripts come in by Friday. If I work late, I can finish by Saturday morning. Our first trip together. I'm so excited. I need to catch a cab. See you later? The shop photo is a little dark. Replace it with a brighter one, and we'll be ready to go. Thanks. Yes, ahead of schedule. Done already, Koroki? Yup. Just Ms. Mikami's column now. It's still Thursday. Help me, then. A client's demanding 2 photo reshoot. Sorry. You're on your own. Fine, but you'd better contact Ms. Mikami. I'm off. Hello hello hello. Hello, it's Koroki. Hi, what's up? Just wondering how the writing's coming. Actually, I'm halfway finished. I'm on an unprecedented roll! It's a revolution! Viva la revolution! That's great. I'll have it for you by tomorrow morning. So get on your Easy Rider bike and look forward to it. Thanks a million. I'll be waiting. Talk to you later. Yes! All clear! Ride to Kyoto together? Really? Smooch on the train? Sign me up! I booked a hotel double. I can't wait! Friday 11:34 am. Morning! Morning! Morning! Top of the morning to ya! Good morning to you all! What? Hello? I haven't received it yet. Drogba has gone missing! Drog-who? Drogba! My beloved black cat! He's the anchor of the team. Everyone's lost without him! Al of you, shut up! Hello? Anyway, I can't send my column until he's found! Forgive me! Wait... hello? No way. Friday 7:28 p.m. Argh! Did she send it in? No, she says she's lost her cat. Uh-oh, that's a dangerous pattern. From my experience, that means Sunday. Sunday? The deadline's today! That's how we give up our weekends. I've got plans tomorrow. I've lost a lot of romantic chances. This can't be happening to me. Hello? Hard at work? Hardly. Can we catch an 8 a.m. train tomorrow? The thing is... Ms. Mikami hasn't finished writing her column yet. What? And it's doubtful she'll get it in by morning. You're kidding, right? You mean we can't go together? Unless she finishes it tonight. Will she? I can't really say. You can't go. Why'd you wait until now to tell me this? Hold on a second. I can't help it. She promised to have it on time. I hate it when men say things like that. It's you who offered to come along. And now this? What? Didn't you offer? What? Come again? Nothing. I'll figure something out. Like what? Give me specifics. I'll be there by tomorrow night, I swear. We'll have Sunday, okay? Promise? I promise. I'll be there! I'll do whatever it takes! Tomorrow night then. Saturday, 216 am. I can't come to the phone... Give me a break. Deadlines are deadlines for a reason. My cat Drogba is missing! Searching the park now! Write! Koroki. Yes? What's up? Meeting a deadline isn't a writer's job. It's yours. Witters take time to do their craft. You make sure it's on time. Sure but... What good are you if all you do is throw work her way and just wait? Tell me who makes a magazine. We do! If you've got plans, then go make it happen! Yes, Sir! Drogba? I've got dinner! Ms. Mikami! I'm exhausted. Why're you here? I saw your tweet. We'll search together. I'm sorry. I haven't finished writing. It's okay. Let's first find Drogba, then you can write. Okay! Let's get moving! One, two, one, two! Drogba! Wait! - Drogba! - Wait! Drogba! Come to mama! No, wait. Let me go. Drogba? It's all right. There's nothing to fear. He went that way, Ms. Mikami! Darn it! Drogba! Get back here! Yes! I caught him! Ouch!! Stop that, Drogba! Calm down! Ouch! Stop that! Drogba! Stop scratching that man! I'll leave you to write. You can finish, can't you? I think so but... I'd like to revise it a little and write about today. The boy who wants to be Tamio Okuda in a dawn cat fight. I think it could be my best column ever. Can I write it? How long will it take? Starting now? 2 days, perhaps? I'm kidding. Okay, you can do it. But promise me you'll finish by 6 p.m.? Well, all right then. Great! Start writing, then. By 6 p.m., got it? - No excuses! - You got it. Saturday, 7:54 p.m. Well? Oh my God, this is awesome, Ms. Mikami! You think so? I've never read anything that captures Tamio so well, and you're not a fan. And it's a Mikami column, to boot! It's so good, I feel like crying. I'm glad. Will you make it? Now I just need to call the designer. I left my iPhone at the office. Thanks so much! Mr. Koroki, wait! Saturday 8:52 p.m. Oh geez. Stay calm, stay calm. Call the designer and submit the manuscript. The last train to Kyoto is 9:30... preceded by a 20-minute taxi ride. I'll call Akari upon arrival. Okay. Yo. Doing good? - What's going on? - Nothing much. What's that? Oh, finishing some work. Articles all in? It's Ms. Mikami's column. I'm in charge now. Is that right? Mind if I make a call? I'm kind of pressed for time. I'm going. I finished my errands. By the way, is that illustration okay? Hello, hello, hello! Ms. Mikami, it's Koroki. About your illustration... The letter on the cap is a zero. That's right. It's C for Carp. O for Okuda. No, it's not O for Okuda. - It's C? - Yes. Yes. Can you fix it quickly? I'm bathing Drogba. He was filthy. Give me 30 minutes. I really need it now. Right now isn't possible, Drogba is... I'm telling you to send it now! You're a professional! I'm nearly out of time! Hello? Hey Akari. I'm sorry! I made it as far as Shinagawa, but missed the last train. I'll catch the first one in the morning, all right? Hello? It's okay. Don't bother. What? Get some sleep. No, I'll be there. I came so close to making it, but... Why didn't you call me sooner? I went out and left my iPhone at the office. That's not my fault. You don't consider my feelings at all! I've been here all by myself without a clue. I didn't know what restaurant to go to for dinner. So I haven't had anything to eat. Then I started feeling ill. It's been awful. I'm sorry. Are you going to be okay? I'm so sorry. I really am. But... I'm dying to see you. Believe me. We just aren't a good fit after all. Let's break up. Why do you say things like that? I can't take it. Hello? Hello? Please... Akari... I did my best. Are you there, Akari? I went looking for a cat... got my face all scratched up. But still managed to get the column done. It's a really good article, too. Wait till you read it. It'll make you laugh so hard. Akari. In a taxi. Catching the last train to you! Thanks for coming. Koroki? Yoo-hoo! Don't go huh? Are you okay? Your face has changed. It has? You're not aware of it? Weird. Not doing drugs, are you? I think I'm just a little tired, that's all. You look scary. Uno will handle the bread and bean jam feature. Old town features need a new angle. The whole category could use a reboot. It's overdone. Why don't we replace old town with downtown? Downtown? That's brilliant. By the way, Koroki. I'm thinking of making that cat feature a serial instead. You are? Everyone's doing cat features. A serial would allow us to publish a book later. Draw up a proposal. Okay. I've got somewhere to be. Good luck. When do you fly to Paris? I go tonight. Scoping out champagne in Paris is 2 total boss perk. Is this work or your personal hobby? Work is my hobby, all right? Good luck. Thanks. Bon voyage. Take care. I'm fine at work. But afterwards, my life is awash in utter loneliness and despair. I want to see her! Okay, I want to screw her! Who's that? What a loser. Yo. Broke up with Akari? You're wondering how I found out. Well, it's a secret. For a while there, you disgusted me. But let's now be partners. She's too much to handle for normal guys like us. Get past it. Who's that? Junior colleague. Drinks on me tonight. Why? It doesn't matter. I feel gross. Tell me why. Why does that jerk Yoshizumi know? Ow. Don't tell me they've patched things up. No! That's impossible! Akari... Akari! I want to see you... I love you. What're you doing preparing for a party? Akari Amano Wait, what? What's this now? Logged in devices How are other devices logged in? Log out Since when? When I left my iPhone at the office! Log in I'm done here. Broke up with Akari? Son-of-a-bitch! That Son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him! He's not getting away with this. Tl kill him! Akari, forgive me for writing so much. I accept our breakup. But I need to speak with you just one more time. I promise this will be the last. I'll be at tomorrow's party. Yoshizumi's sure to come after seeing my text. I'll grill him for breaking into my phone... and about Akari. God, she's as cute as ever. Oh Akari... Ah, there he is. That bastard! Wait, what? Chief? What's going on? Why is he here and not in Paris? Don't tell me it wasn't Yoshizumi who tapped my phone. How about that girl at Goff in & King you worked with? Am I imagining things? Or has Akari bewitched both Chief and Yoshizumi? Say it isn't so! What's going on here? I saw it all, Koroki and Akari's text communications. What're you saying? I called Yoshizumi here. You falsely believed you'd made up, so I assembled us all. But this is a situation that Akari also desired. Of course, I want to respect her wishes. But blowing off a wedding leaves accounts to be settled. What? Wedding? She had accepted my marriage proposal. You're lying. Not possible. Akari's my woman. Huh? That's bull. She's my girlfriend! You drove her to tears, you boor! Hah, you hounded her incessantly like a stalker. You abusive creep! You've known her 3 months! How many times do you think we've had sex? You're nothing! I'm the only one who understands her! Yes, make asses of yourselves before a married couple. The only one capable of understanding her is me! What're you saying? I don't plan on becoming your wife. And I'm not Yoshizumi's woman or Koroki's girlfriend. What? But you said okay when I proposed. I'm your savior, right? You called me your boyfriend. I said that to make you happy. That's all. You lied to all of us? No, I didn't. Those were my true feelings at those times. I was just trying to be your type of woman. But I'm afraid it's over between us. Thank you for everything. No. I can't do that! You're joking, right? This is Liar Liar Liquid, where the opposite happens. Tell them what you told me in Kyoto. Thanks for coming. Truth is I've been so worried about you. You can always call me when you're in trouble. Call me. Not another guy, but me. Think of me as your savior. Thanks. You're the only one I can count on. I brought a secret gadget with me. Volumes 6 and 7 of Doraemon. I said I'd lend them to you, remember? Don't flip through it like that. The arc from So Long, Doraemon to Doraemon Returns... is areal tear jerker. Really? I had no idea. You've never read them? No. I've seen the cartoon. What secret gadget do you like? I like Suneo. That's a character. And what's there to like about him? Well for one thing, he never gets bullied by Gian. He teases Nobita, but not enough to be hated. He strikes me as well balanced. Plus he's rich. I think Suneo gets the most enjoyment out of life. You surprise me. You come off as a goofball, but you're very sharp sometimes. Am I? Listen... about Koroki... Wait, not that. Oh God. I'll never be happy if I can't be with you forever, Akari! I'll be with you forever! I love you, Akari! Akari. Forgive me. I should've done that sooner. I knew about you, him and Koroki. I admit I took pleasure in seeing it. But it's all right now. Because I love you, Akari. Sales insists upon a loathsome cat feature. Why not? Go do one. They think a cat on the cover will sell. I've put my soul into my covers. Our cat-themed, spring-summer collection sold out. I refuse to sell my soul to some cats. You don't need to sell your soul. Don't sell your soul. Just sell your heart. That's what you've spent your career doing. Akari... marry me. Okay. In exchange for that... give Mr. Koroki the cat feature. Mr. Koroki... is extremely suited for it. Heaven. My ideal woman in every way. Akari. What is all this? I can't tell what's real, and what's a lie. I beg you. Please just... show me the real you. When the host said, Your jeans are stained... he casually replied, Yeah, I spilled ramen broth on them. The whole studio erupted in laughter. When I saw that, I thought, He's cool. Every other musician or idol is dressed to the nines. And he's got ramen stains. He's got this devil may care attitude to life. That's when I decided I wanted to be like him. Your god? Is Tamio Okuda like a god to you? I wouldn't call him a god. Where is he, I wonder. God, that is. Show me the real Akari. This is it. I'm exactly the girl you think I am. You're all right now, Mr. Koroki. Chief was arrested. Yoshizumi's life was never at risk, but he quit the company. My actions were viewed by the police as self-defense. The incident made the news. Malet was discontinued the next month. A gossip magazine reported the incident in great detail. And then went viral online. There was truth to it, but mostly it lambasted Malet and the chief. Both Yoshizumi and my names were widely reported. But strangely, Akari's name never appeared once. Her cell phone went out of service... her social network accounts deleted. Not only that, the name Akari Amami didn't exist anywhere. 3 years later Ms. Mikami. Koroki, I'm so glad you came! Alias please. Oops, sorry. This is Joe Anno, the hottest book producer in town. Stop exaggerating. I'm just an editor. Mr. Anno? I've heard a lot about you. Can I give you my card? - Of course. - Great! I've read every book you've published. Thank you very much. He was my editor when I wrote for Malet. He was very talented even then. He helped me find my lost cat. Nostalgic. I liked Malet's clear editorial policy. Me too. A legendary magazine. I was only there at the end. How cool! Not at all. Really. Why did it go out of circulation? I don't recall. I think I read something about it online. - A scandal? - That's right. About what? I must be going. You just arrived! I'm doing 2 talk on Niconico Live. Really? On what? The Olympic games' impact on the creative industry or something? He's an opening ceremony advisor. Wow! I'm simply giving a lecture to some old men, anonymously. Eat some catered food. No time. I'll get some soba at a station stand. Excuse me. Nice meeting you. And you. My pleasure. Later Ms. Mikami. Soba stand noodles? I like his style. Very down to earth. A lot was said about him online, but he's always been a great guy. All who meet him like him. Well I just met him, and I'm sold. Koroki! Coming home late? Well, I have a meeting after the live talk. Then some proofs by morning. There's meatloaf in the fridge. Thanks. I'll go back inside then. Okay. If you want to know if I became like Tamio Okuda, the answer is No. But others might see me now... as someone who isn't afraid to follow his instincts freely. I got there by a different path than that of Tamio Okuda. Without lying to myself, I know... how my words will make people feel, and what'll make them happy. I can alter my impression on others without changing myself. It's a method that was effectively taught to me... by Akari. Here's Tamio Okuda with Custom!
