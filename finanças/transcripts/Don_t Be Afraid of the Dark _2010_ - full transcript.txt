Mr Blackwood? Sir? Mr Blackwood, I'm sorry... Did you ring, Sir? Mr Blackwood: Come down. Sorry... I didn't see the steps. - They made me do it. If I want to see my child again... I must comply. Please understand. I brought you something more to eat. It's not children's teeth, like you wanted. Please accept them. Give me back my child. - Daddy! Daddy! - Son! She's landed. What do you think? Too much? Nooo... It's perfect. Just like you. There's my girl. Sally? Woww... Look how tall you are. What, what are you? Seventeen... now? Sally, this is Kim. Kim... Sally. Hi, Sally. It's nice to meet you. Thanks. What about a picture? You got your camera? It's good to see you. Everything, okay? - yeah. Smell that fresh air, kiddo? Sure beats the smug of LA, huh? I have to call mum now. Hi, you've called Joann, and the magical Sally. Please leave a message. Good huh? It smells funny. Oh, you should've smell it before. we had moldy newspapers everywhere; dead pigeons all over the floor... poops... - lots of it. It's Jacoby's office. Mr Jacoby? Oh hey, Michelle... sorry. I don't know. Hold on, I'll check. Did he... you got the photographs? I like to draw too. - Do you work here? No, Sally... I live here. I'm the interior designer. Do you know what that is? Of course, you do. Do you see all the animal paintings and freezes? They are by Emerson Blackwood. A man who once lived here. He's a very famous wild life painter. Hey Sally, Look. You wanna try? What do you have there? - I found it. That's mine. It was my granmother's, When I was little my mother gave it to me. - My mom gave me to my dad. Sally, do you wanna see your room? What do you think? Kim and I worked, really hard to get it ready. Check this out. Its pretty great huh? It looks better at night. How long am I staying here? What did your mother tell you? She told me, I'm coming to visit. and then she packed all my clothes. She didn't explain anything to you? No. Sally... your mother and I are worried about you. she thinks that, maybe you're feeling sad and... we thought that... Well, we thought that... perhaps a change might be good for you. And that, you could come and live here; with Kim and Me. Until, we finished the work on the house and we sell it and... we could move somewhere else. Sally, c'mon open the door. Sally, come on let me in. Are you going to marry her? Uh, that's between Kim and Me. Mom said you only like her, only because she's young. which she isn't. She's old. Sally? Open the door. Sally, please... let's talk about this. I know it must be tought. You've had a long flight... it's strange being in a new house. I want to go to bed now. Okay. Don't forget to brush your teeth. You'd be a terrible poker player. You've been ironing that shirt for like half an hour. Well, she sure didn't take to me. I wouldn't take it personally; she's like that to everybody. Those pills she takes, what are they? Hetarol... I think. - Jesus! Well, that's her mother for you. You know, that woman medicated her dog. - So, what about Jacoby? Well, his assistant said that, he still hasn't look at the photograph yet. - But he's had them for a week. - I know. - But we are still on the running, and he's still coming to the dinner. - He should just give us the cover. - Yes, he should. - He gave it to the Spencer's restorer two years ago; and you've done miracles here. We have done miracles here. It's not about me. Thank you. Is this one new? Yeah - Great! Well, if we get the cover of the 'Architecture Digest' We won't need to take another bank loan. Would we? - You know what your daughter told me today? - What? She said, your wife gave her to you. Kids say all kinds of things they don't mean. It couldn't have gone any worst today. I feel like the evil-stepmother. The evil and very old stepmother. Let's not forget the old part. Cos i was kinda thinking... The stuffed bear! what was i thinking. Oh c'mon... its great, she likes it. It's in her room. On the bed? Well, above the bed. Hanging by a noose. Sally! It is not safe for you back here! Hey! What's going on? Everything okay? Keep her off from the back of the house. She could fall in and we'd be in a hell of a mess. I didnt do anything. There's pits... old wells. Its dangerous for a child. Mr Harris is right, Sally. His granfather worked at the house. You shouldn't be back here. But, i found a basement. There's no basement. Easy Harris. I'll take her. It's okay. It's here. Its right there. You know, there's a reason this house is called 'Fallen Mill'. The English had a mill here, that's turned into a sink hole. - That's why, most of the house around here doesn't have a basement. This one does. - You might wanna check this out. - It's unsafe for a child. - Look! I told you it was here. - Can you believe this? This is defenitely hollow. I'm gonna get some tools. - Are you sure you wanna do this? - Of course! Are you kidding? We can fix this easy; if we have to. you may wanna step back. - Mr Hurst... I... There's a door in here. - Where did you put all the house cases? - They're in your junk drawer, in your office. Okay. Have a look. Oh wow... You be careful, Sally. - Okay. How the hell did we miss this? - That must be the garden window. All of these paints and colours; this is amazing! Alex, look at this. Harris, Did you know about this? This place is not safe... uh uh especially for kids. Its Okay, we'll keep an eye on her. This must be where, Blackwood worked. I found another door. Look at this sketches. - That's an ash pit, I think. - These are incredible. - Okay... let's go Sally. C'mon, Sally let's go. Sally... C'mon. Subtitle by D3xt3r No, I just need to make sure, I get back the paintings and furniture back. In time for the dinner. Well, you told me you could. C'mon how long we've know each other. I'll write you a post-dated check. Hold on. - Hey, there you are. I thought maybe, we could make scones. I promised Mrs Underhill, we wouldn't make too much of a mess. - No... that's okay. - What have you got there? - My doll... and my drawing stuffs. Who are you? What do you look like? Wait a minute, will you? Sally? Sally? What're you doing down here? I heard something. - Rats probably. C'mon its time for dinner. - It was a voice. Really smart rats, then. No... listen. Nothing. C'mon... let's go kiddo. I forgot my bag. - Well, hurry up then. Sally, now! We can get this, tomorrow. You're not hungry? Sally? Don't you like rice? Mrs Underhill made apple pie for dessert. Apple pie has gluten. Mommy said, gluten is bad for my consentration. - Oh, C'mon... You love apple pie. You can worry about your consentration tomorrow. - Mommy says, no gluten. - What's your mother filling your head with? - How about, some chocolate milk. - No... no no. - I'll make some. Hold on... hold on. Sally, You need to eat this; or you can go to your room. Okay? - Good night Dad. - What? Does that work when you were a kid? - She's testing us, Kim. That's what kids do. Who's the parent here? - Certainly, not me. I didn't mean that. No... you're right. I'm not a parent. Hey, we talked about this. Remember? - No, we talked about this Alex. - I'm not sure, I'm ready to be anybody's mother. - Oh, C'mon. - I had a hard time, getting over my own childhood. Have to deal with somebody's else. - Listen, will you help me out with this, please? I realise this is terrible timing. But I don't have a choice. I can't just send her back. - You know, that's not what I am asking you to do. Apple pie. Thanks. Hello? - Hi Alex, it's Joann. - Hi Joann. Can I speak to Sally? - No you can't. - Why not? Because, she's asleep. We are three hours ahead in time. Listen, why were you thinking, not telling her, that she's gonna live here? Doll: 'I love you' 'I love you' Did you just speak to me? 'I love you' 'I love you' 'I love you' 'I love you' 'I love you' Creepy voice: Sally, turn off the lights. We want to be friend. - Where's my doll? With us... with us. Sally's doll is with us. - Who are you? friend? Where? Come down to the basement... then, we will show. - Where are you? - What are you? Well, I have foods. How do I see you? I won't hurt you, I promise. Alex: Sally? What are you doing under there? - I'm looking for my doll. - Well, oh... How about Teddy instead? No... that's alright. Did you lose a tooth? That's not mine. I found it. - I found it, what... here in the house? Yeah. Can I call Mommy now? No, it's too late. She's probably asleep. I don't think you should keep this. Its not very sanitary. What about this, light? Should I... - Leave it on, please. Alright, well, sleep-well. - Oh, Sally? Would you do me a favor? Would you try to... maybe, friends with Kim? yes. - Thanks, kiddo. - Kim... have you seen my razor? We have to leave in five minutes. - Yeah... Have you seen my razor? - Here, take mine. Five minutes. - My dress! Sally? I wanna talk to you, down stairs, right now. Sally, I cannot believe you cut up Kim's clothes. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I swear. - Sally, just stop lying. It was a horrible thing to do. and it was dangerous; You could've cut yourself. What did you use? My razor? What is this? where did you get this? - Let me go home. you can't go home. Please, let me go home. I'm sorry about this. She hasn't done anything like this before. She's obviously very angry about something. - Alex, that is not anger. That's fear. I need to go. Mrs Underhill, Kim and I have an appointment at the historical society; We will be back this afternoon. Sally, we are going out. you listen to Mrs Underhill and do what she says. You think about, what you need to say to Kim, Okay? Are you there? Did you cut Kim's clothes? Do you have my dad's razor? You have to tell me the truth. If you wanna be friends. I won't be angry. - Sally's not angryy. but they are angry. Come down here, Sally. Come down. You said, you're hungry. Do you like raisins? See... Delicious! Did you do something bad? You'll have to answer, if you wanna be friends. Sally? What are you doing down here, in the dark. Were you talking to someone? Is there someone here with you? - No, I'm all alone. There's nobody here. - Why don't... You go help Mrs Underhill... make lunch. Go on. Off you go now! That's right. Up those stairs, quick as you can now. - Nooo. Harris You old fool! - I swear, I didn't tell them anything. Get away! I had an accident, call for help. Don't... don't look. I could hear him screams. Noises. - Did he said anything? It was so dark in there. - Are you Mr Harris's employer? - Yeah. There's been an accident. - Are you okay? Where's Sally? I'm sorry. She saw him. I tried to cover her eyes, I was too late. - Where is she? She's in the garden... Oh, I'm sorry. Sally? Hi. Were you scared? You wanna talk about it? Is Mr Harris is going to die? No, sally. He's gonna be okay. Can I show you something? This is my favourite part of the house. Luck would like nature. We imported these from Japan. They are calle 'Kuay' They're considered magical. Badgers can't spot them against the mud at the bottom. Because of their bright colors. So, it makes them... Special. It's also, what makes them vulnerable. They've to be tought. And you too, Sally. - I didn't touch your clothes. I swear to God... I never touched them. I didn't touch em. I didn't. I promise. I don't care about those clothes. I can't really tell... It's hard to see the coin's really worn out. - We can probably find it in Blackwood's studio. - Well, I don't wanna go down there anymore. I'm worry about it, Kim. It's not safe. Hey, this is Joanna... - Mommy! Oh, sweety it's you! How are you? Can I come home? - You wanna come home... what do you mean? - I don't like it here. You what? Honey, don't fret. It's so beautiful there, You just need to get used to it. But it's cold. - Huh? Honey... what? My bed is too big. - Sweetheart. - I think i'm getting sick. You're not getting sick. Honey, it's gonna take a tiny bit of getting used to it. You're gonna be fine. You'll get used to it. I gotta go... Honey. Mommy's gotta go. I'll see you soon... bye! Kim... Don't leave. - What wrong? Even when i'm asleep... don't turn off the lights. - I'll be right here. Sally... what's the matter? What's the matter? I don't want them to come anymore. - Who Sally? The little old things... they live in the basement. They said, they wanted to be my friend. But, they are horrible... and mean. oh, Sally. You just had a nightmare. No... don't say that! My bear. Look what they did to my bear. Your dad tells me, Art is your favourite subject. I wish I could draw. Drawing is easy. The other kids can't do face and hands. - Whey you say, the other kids; Do you feel they're different from you? - Doc back home, asked me that. - What was your answer? Okay. Let's start with something easier. What's your favourite color? What is that... Purple? Black. - How about this little things you saw. What do you think they are? - Fairies... or gnomes? - But scary ones... hmm? And you say, they know your name. They talk to you? Yes. What does they say? - They wanna play with me. - Is that all? - They say, my parents don't love me. - Can I go now? - Just a few more questions. Okay? There's a lot of anxiety in that little girl. And a deep belief that she's not wanted. I believe, that's what triggering these fantastic episodes. She told me she found a little tray with teeths, right inside this fireplace. - Yeah... she found a tooth But that doesn't mean anything, does it? Deconstructing these elaborate fantasies; Wringkles, claws... fangs. Has individuated each one of those things, Her imaginary world's inhabitants It's as detailed as anybody I've encountered. - So, what do we do? I'd like to try stronger medication, for starters. I'll ask the doctor in LA, to send her medical charts; You call my office and Make another appoinment, okay? - Okay, great. - Meanwhile, I'll give you something to help her sleep. We're already late. I can't believe it. If we don't get this things along, we're not gonna get the paintings and furniture back on time. Oh, we forgot the invitations for the historical society. - You know, maybe... we should just pospond the dinner. Kim, its architectural digest. We have to get the house on the cover! - I know. If we don't... I'm never gonna get my career back. - I know! And we won't be able to sell this place. - What about what's been happening? What, Harris? That was an accident. - I'm talking about Sally. Its all in her head... Kim. - Yeah, but it's real to her. It doesn't matter if we didn't see. - C'mon! - Calm Down! I'm gonna walk. It'll be faster. I'll see you back there. I'm not sure, how lucid he'll be. He's pretty heavily sedated. Mr Harris I know this is difficult. but I... I need to understand something. I need to know, what Sally saw; so that I can help her. - Is she... out Out of the house? - No. - Out... She needs to be out of there. - Why? Why was that room sealed up? - Granfather... - Your granfather closed it up... Why? - After... after - After what? - Blackwood. - What about Blackwood? Lot eleven, thirty four... public library. Get her... out of the house. Excuse me? - Can I help you? - I'm looking for the librarian. Lot eleven, thirty four? - Oh, Emerson Blackwood. Special collections. One sec. Right this way. I can't remember, the last time anyone requested this. They're beautiful! - I'm a designer... I've been working at The Fallen Mill. Wow! Now that's a priviledge. You come across his mural? - A mural? Where? - There in the house, supposedly. If you do... I'd love to see it. Hello? Now, it's uh... pretty ironic, really. A committed realist; Someone who insisted on drawing only from nature; to do this. At the end of his life. - I've looked at everything on Blackwood; and i've never seen any of these. - Oh, you wouldn't. The family made a restricted donations. So, these... may never be published. - Is it possible to get copies? - Well... i'll see what I can do. - Wrinkles, Claws... teeth? Have you ever read Maken? Arthur Maken. Welsh. He believed in fairy folk. These ancient entities from the nether world. Predating mankind. Blackwood, quotes him extensively. here... that line. There! 'One life must be taken' 'These creatures had to take one human life everytime they emerged' 'To replenished their rank' 'Many of these creatures fed on the bones' 'Teeth, of young children' and then, There was a truce. A pact, of sorts. Between Pope Silvester II and these ancient beings; In the year 999. In exchange for human teeth' they start leaving silver pieces under the pillow. Now... This is the last know drawing by Emerson Blackwood. Made shortly before his disappearance. And the lost of his child. - His child? Blackwood's only son vanished! Lost! No long after Blackwood himself disappeared. Withour a trace. Oh my God! Dear, Thank Goodness! You're home. Where's she? I put her to bed. She wouldn't stop screaming. Sally? Kim! She's not down here. I think, she'd run away. She's done it before. You know, once... She tried to walk all the way back to LA. from our family home in Boston. I wouldn't be surprised, If that's what she's doing. I went to visit Harris today. Blackwood had a son. Did you know that? And when he was eight, He disappeared. And Blackwood vanished, a few days later. Why are you telling me this? A lot of what Blackwood wrote at the end of his life; It's awefully close to Sally's story. Gnomes... Creatures all over. Oh, Kim. Don't tell me you believe this. Something terrible happened in that basement. We need to leave. Put a million miles between us and that house. Look, every cents I have is in this house, Okay? And you're saying that, we just walk away? Look, I accept that my daughter has problems. Okay? Thank you. We all know that. They do not involve monsters at the basement. There she is. Come on Sally. Get in the car. Sally, please. Just tonight. And after the party, we'll talk. Okay? - Subtitle by D3xt3r. Four, three... two and one. There! After the party, I will get you out of here. No matter what. I promise. Sally? I took it from them. You can't have this. you don't understand... I need to fight back. Absolutely not! - Please! Nobody believes me. Sally, I trust you. And you 'can' tell me anything, Anything at all. They don't like bright lights either. Then, I have a good idea. - Mr Jacoby... I'm so glad that you can make it. - Alex, please call me Charles. My wife Evelyn. - Hello... Alex. - It's a pleasure. C'mon In. The house look absolutely, Fantastic! - You've done a remarkable job. Well, Thank you. - We'd love a nickel tour. - Of course. That's the whole point. The Foie... Obviously...

Easy, Sally Not everyone loves to have their photographs taken, Okay? - So, Alex... Where's Kim? Uhh... I think, she's still upstairs. Why don't you step into the library, Grab a drink, and I'll join you in a moment. Kim, hey what's going on? Her drawings... They're exactly Blackwood's Sketches. Yeah, I'm sure. She probably sure that she over-saw your photographs and she copied them. No, she didn't. Kim... please, the Jacobys are here. Alex, this is your daughter. - I know. This is serious! Just because you keep denying, doesn't mean its not happening. Kim, I can't do this... Excuse me, Mr Hurst. When should we serve dinner. Ten Minutes. Please, Kim... everybody's waiting. Will you come downstairs, we can talk about this later. I have proof, look? - Not now. C'mon. Welcome everybody. Please, have a seat. Uh...
