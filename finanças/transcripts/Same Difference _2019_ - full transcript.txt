It really makes you think, you know? I mean... why not? Why shouldn't I just... live my life however it is that I wanna live it? If I wanna have a drink, then maybe I should just have a drink. What difference does it make? What does it matter? I spent so much time for so long trying to do the quote unquote "right thing." Maybe it was all for nothing. It's like if... something makes you happy, and you aren't hurting anybody, then what's the harm? Because of drinking, my wife has already left me. My kids don't talk to me anymore. Uh, clearly I have nothing else to lose, so I just figure if I'm going to die, then... maybe I should die with a smile on face. Right? I should be out on a beach in Hawaii or... or, I don't know, climbing the top of a mountain, or sitting in a strip club somewhere. Anywhere else but here! I guess I just... I wish I had more time. That's it. Thank you, Steve. ♪ So everyone, uh, we have someone new joining us today. It's Tonya, correct? Yes. - Hi. - Welcome, Tonya. Welcome, Tonya. So I forgot to ask you when we were on the phone, how did you hear about us? Oh, um, I was just... - Those are cameras, right? - Yeah. Yes, we find it best to record our sessions in order to ensure that we have an accurate record. Okay, I'm not really comfortable being recorded. Do you mind turning them off, please? Of... sure. Um, Charles? Um, okay. Thank you. So, uh, why don't you, uh, continue? How did you hear about us? Oh, um, I was just... I was just wondering if what I've been feeling is normal, and obviously it's not. Yes, it is. Okay. Common. It's not... common. So I was doing some research on the internet. And, um, that's when I found your group's site. Well, great. We're glad to have you. Right? Um, can you tell us exactly what you've been feeling? Um... it's difficult to put it into words. I mean... uh, I don't know. How would you describe it? Oh, well, um, out of all of us, at the moment, Steve is the only one who's leaving soon. The rest of us are here to better understand this phenomenon to try to prepare ourselves for it and, um, to provide comfort for our fellow members when their time approaches. Okay, so, um... how would you describe it, Steve? - Like I'm fucking dying. - Yeah. Please forgive Steve. As you probably already know, this can be an especially difficult process for some people. Yeah, sure, I... I get it. But, uh, from what I can tell, you seem to be taking it pretty well. I think I'm in denial. I mean, it doesn't really make sense. And yet, here you are. Do you... know how much time you have left? Feels like a few days. Steve, please. When did it... first dawn upon you that you experienced this? I'm sorry. Wait a minute. I just wanna make sure that I'm clear. So out of everyone here, Steve and I are the only ones who know that we're dying? - We're all dying, Tonya. It's just a matter of when. - Okay, but... what makes you believe us? Believe it or not, human beings, biologically speaking, are extremely instinctive. Many of us just take it for granted. Our bodies tell us when we're about to get sick, when we're about to yawn, when we have to go to the bathroom in one minute versus one hour. Since our ability to predict these things is so instinctive, why would our deaths be any different? Right. Well, I guess that makes sense. Uh... is there anyone in the group who's passed? Two. How did they die? Cardiac arrest. Heart attack. Both of 'em. So... what do I do now? Whatever the fuck you wanna do. Tonya, it's pretty much up to you. But if you want my advice, I, uh... I think you should look at it like it's a gift. I know. That sounds strange. But not everyone is fortunate enough to know exactly how much time they have left. And you have been given a rare opportunity to live your final moments doing whatever your heart desires. Don't squander it. ♪ Yes. I have a reservation and I need to make a change. Initially I asked for a queen-sized bed. I'd like to swap it out for two doubles. Okay, great. No, that's it. Thank you so much. Okay. Au revoir. Bye. We did it. Yeah, we did it. Wish me luck, Lucy. - Yeah? - Hey, Sis. - How ya been? - What do you want? Well, I wanted to ask you about a couple of things. Do you mind if I come in? Yeah. I mind. Oh, oh, okay. Uh... well, um, I've beenthinking about this for a while. And, um, I think this whole us not speaking thing for such a long time is kind of silly, right? So I was hoping that we could get together and, you know, - talk through it. - We're talking right now. Right, but I was hoping that we could go elsewhere. 'Cause, you know, it's gonna be kinda hard to work through some stuff standing in a doorway. Yeah, well, it's gonna be pretty tough for us to solve anything between us standing anywhere. Well... can't hurt to try, right? How about this? How about I just, um, make us dinner later, and you come over, and I'll make your favorite, seared ahi. You mean your favorite. You love it too. - Yeah, no thanks. - Wait, wait, wait! Shauna! Come on, we're family. I gotta go to work.

Listen, um, the only reason I'm here is because I locked myself out of my apartment and it's gonna be a few hours before they can let me in. - Well, that's okay. Um, whatever I can do to help. You just let me know, okay? - All right? - Yeah, thanks. So can I offer you something to drink? You want some water? Soda? You got any wine? - Yeah. Uh, I think so.

You been good? I mean, you look fabulous. - Please don't patronize me. I just got off work. - I know I look like shit. - No, not at all. I mean, you look healthy. Fatter. - I didn't say that. I said you look healthy. You look well. So... you just got off work. You still managing at the restaurant? Yeah, I'm still there. You still like it? - It's fine. It pays the bills. Aww, I think someone likes you. Hello. What's your name? - Her name's Lucy. - Hello, Lucy. I'm Shauna. You've, um... you've had her for, like... three months.

So, um... you're working at the restaurant. It's been busy? I mean, it's been busy, but, you know, not too busy. I just remember this time of year it would be crazy 'cause of all the tourists in November. Yeah, it's picked up a bit, you know, but not so much that I'd notice 'cause, you know, - I'm used to it, I guess. - Yeah. I remember you used to just work those crazy hours.

I'll stop with all the questions, all right? The food's almost ready, so let's just sit down and have a meal together. Okay? Please? Fine. You always did know how to push my buttons. Well, you know, we argue because we love each other. We argue 'cause we annoy the hell out of each other. - That too. - Mm. Speaking of annoying, Tommy reached out to me again last month. - Tommy Latimer? - Yup. He emailed me. Wow, he's still doing that. Just like clockwork. So, what did you say? Nothing. I didn't respond. I never do. Shauna, maybe you should. I mean, I understand why you didn't at first, but it's been a long time. It might help you to talk about it with him. I'm trying to forget, not remember. Shauna... no matter how much of that stuff you drink, you're not gonna be able to forget. You need to stop blaming yourself. That's really easy for you to say, because nothing is ever your fault. You set off a reaction that kills everybody who's close to you... then you can talk to me about blame. Listen, I know things have been shitty. Really shitty. But Mica's death is not your fault. Mom's death had nothing to do with you. Dad's death had nothing to do with you.

Like, do I have a cold? - Uh, no. More like have you had any, um... discomfort in your chest? - Chest pains? - No, no, not like that. Just, you know, it's kind of there, it's not there. It's hard to describe. - Is it serious? Have you been to a doctor? No, I'm fine. I just wanted to know if you've been feeling all right lately. I mean, I've been sober for a couple of hours, so the only thing I feel right now are withdrawals, you know? But before that, you would've probably had to hit me with a cement truck for me to feel anything. Okay, right. All right, well, never mind. I'm fine. Uh, and by the way, your password is Lucy. Okay, cool. All right, now we need a profile picture. And you don't have any personal pictures in your phone. Okay, that's weird. I'm gonna take a picture for you. - No, no, hey, hey! What?

It's cute. Okay, now we just need a personal statement. Oh my god, I'm so regretting doing this. Shauna, it doesn't have to be cheesy. Okay, so, you know, come up with something. No, you gotta give me something. Well, okay, since we took a picture of the two of us together, we should probably saysomething about us being twins. Okay. So how about... hashtag #ClonesHaveMoreFun? Yeah, that's good, except for the fact that every guy that hits me up is gonna ask about a threesome. Okay, you're right, that's... yeah, no, let's scratch that.

All right. Yeah, no. - Hello. Ew. - Shauna. Shauna, slow down, it's not a race. I'm just... I'm having fun. So, what happens next? I mean, how do you know if there's a match? Oh, okay, well, if there is a match, it looks like this. Ooh. You made a match with him? He's cute, right? He's handsome. Is he nice? Oh, I don't know. I haven't met him yet. Well, what are you waiting for? I mean, I've just been busy with stuff. It's funny though, he did ask if we could meet up tonight. Well, what'd you say? I haven't responded yet. What is wrong with you? Text him back. Why don't you go out with him? No, what? No, huh-uh. - Hmm-mm. - Why not? You're obviously attracted to him. Tonya, he's interested in you. Shauna, we look the same. He has no idea what my personality is like, okay? It's the same thing to him. I don't know. Come on, he could be perfect. I'll text him right now. Oh my God, okay. Okay. All right. "Ah, sure... just let me know when and where." Smiley face. Send. Smiley face? Oh my God, I can't believe I'm doing this. I don't even have an outfit. Oh, you can borrow something of mine. I'll help you get ready. All right. Hey, I'm not wearing beige. Yeah! Yes, yeah! Come on, let's go! That was like a whole 'nother decibel. Jesus. Okay, look up for me. You were always so much better at this than I am. Yeah, well, it's like looking in a mirror. Really? You're still using that same corny-ass joke? - Uh, I couldn't help myself. It's been awhile. Yeah, it has. You know, I wasn't gonna bring this up, but I gotta tell you, I'm still worried about you. Oh my gosh, really, Debbie Downer? What? It's just, you know, I mean, we're sitting here together, and it feels like everything is normal between us. Okay, well, that's a good thing, right? Yeah, but how can I not worry? I mean, you're okay now, but would you be okay if something happened to me? Like what? I don't know, like... what if I got struck by lightning, would you be okay? You're the one being struck by lightning. Would you be okay? You know what I mean. It's like every time something happens, you blame yourself and you spiral out of control. "Every time something happens," is that what we're calling it? Tonya, our little brother shot himself in the face because I wasn't paying attention. And then mom and dad died basically of heartbreak because of it. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about me. If something happened to me, would you spiral out of control again? Yeah, probably. I mean, especially if it happened to you. Listen, you and I are connected in a way I can't even describe. So, if something happened to you, it would be like... losing my right arm. Yeah, I know. You know, when we weren't talking... it wasn't that bad for me. I mean, mostly because you're a pain in my ass. But also because... when you're happy, when you're sad, when you're depressed... I can feel it. It's like I know what's going on with you. I'm not going through this life by myself. I'm going through it with you.

Earlier, you said that, uh... you don't drink anymore. Yep. Is anything that prompted that decision? Yeah, it's probably because I'm an alcoholic. Oh, wow. You don't hear that on a first date too often. I'm sorry, Cameron, I just... I wanna be open and upfront - with you about everything. - Thank you. I... I respect that. How long have you been sober? Um, a little less than a day. A day? You're supposed to be encouraging. Oh my God, yes, you're right. Um, okay, a day. Hey, hey, a day. Look, you gotta start somewhere. Exactly. Actually I know somebody from college that really struggled with alcoholism, so I get it. Every day's a new opportunity. So, I'm sorry, and congratulations, sincerely. - Thank you. - Absolutely. So... was there like a specific reason why you said like "I'm done drinking?" I mean, yeah, there were many reasons, but I think the main one is I... I just wanna be a better person. I've just done a lot of things to hurt people in my family, hurt my sister, especially. And, um, yeah, I don't wanna be that anymore. I want something different. Wow. That's great. I mean, really, it can't be easy to say that. - Okay, so enough about me. - Okay. Um, do you have any deep, dark secrets you wanna, you know, get off your chest? Uhhh, okay. Um, recently, I lost a lot of weight. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. Well, not recently, like a year ago, I lost 80 pounds. Eighty pounds, wow. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so was there like, you know, a reason, a moment where you realized that you had to like lose the weight? I had a heart attack, yeah. Holy moly. And I'm not even 35 like... That must have been really scary. - Terrifying. Yeah, I know. But, you know, in retrospect, it made me go to the gym. I went vegan. I got my life together. And I'm now 80 pounds lighter to talk about it. Yeah. Wow. So, I mean, it sounds to me likeit was a blessing in disguise. Yeah, I guess you could say that. So, are there are any... before pictures of... - No, absolutely not. - ... chubby Cameron? - There's absolutely not. - There isn't? Really, not anywhere... I didn't take any photos. - Never? - Never. Let me see. - No judgment. - No judgment. - You promise? - I promise. - I... - Don't. - You're very cute. Yes! - No, don't do that. - Stop. Stop. - No. Chubby Cameron is very attractive, before and after. Well, thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. Okay, I... I have a question. I'm scared now, what? So, who gets more play with the ladies? Chubby Cameron or thin Cameron? Chubby Cameron versus thin Cameron? I would say... it's interesting... I would say that thin Cameron attracts women that are prettier on the outside, and chubby Cameron attracts women that are prettier on the inside, with you being the exception to that rule. Okay, well, we just met, so there's no way you could know that was true, but I hope to live up to that declaration. You will. So, which moment was it that made you feel it? The moment that I punched that guy in the face? Or the moment I told you I'm an alcoholic? Both. And I... I know... I probably sound really crazy right now. Yeah, you do sound very, very crazy. I know, but... there's something special about you. Your strength, your openness, your vulnerability, your beauty. Such a light. You're special. Wow. That was amazing. But oh yeah. Oh my gosh, really? Mark? Mm-hmm. You know you have to go home, right? Jesus. Hasn't even been 30 seconds already. I was pretty clear that I needed my space tonight. But you weren't exactly clear as to why. I mean, I was just here a couple of nights ago. And it seems as though you like me. That's what I wanna believe, but maybe it's just the sex. - Maybe that's it. - No. No, it's not just the sex. Then what's the problem? I wasn't gonna tell you, butl'm probably gonna go away soon, and I just... I don't think it'sa good idea for either one of us to get attached. When were you gonna tell me? As soon as I knew one way or the other. Well, you let me know when you find out, all right. Thank you for understanding. I really hope you stay. Yo, Lakers... suck. No, man, Clippers all day. You don't understand howhappy I am to hear you say that. No, Tonya, had you said you were a Lakers' fan, it would have been a deal-breaker. For sure, for sure. We should go to a game. That'd be dope. You know what? There's something I need to tell you. Okay. Why so serious? Don't punch me in the face. No, this might be worse. Um, okay, so how do I say this? Um... I'm okay with kids. I'm not Tonya. Who are you? What do you mean? I'm Shauna, Tonya's sister. Her twin sister. You're for real? - Yeah. - What? Okay, so earlier today, she was trying to show me how the Findr app works. And she was showing me herprofile, and I saw your picture, and I kept going on and on about how hot you are. And she just thought it would bea good idea for me to go out and get out of the house and go on a date. And so she text you back and made arrangements to meet you, except it's me who showed up. And I'm sorry, because, um, we didn't mean any harm. But I should have... I should have told you earlier. So your name is Shauna? And you have your twin sister named Tonya, who's been texting me this entire time? So I've been texting a complete different person? Yeah, no, listen, I know it's stupid. And it's... it's childish, and I don't blame you if you don't ever wanna go out with me again. You are full of surprises, I'll tell you that. You're mad. Okay, so, um, I get it. So, we should probably get going. Yeah. Yeah, we probably should. But, I mean, before we leave, I guess I need to get your number. Wait, what? Well, if I've been texting Tonya this entire time, and you're Shauna, then I guess I need Shauna's number. Yeah. So you're... what? You're not mad? Listen, no harm, no foul. Nobody got hurt. And you said I was hot, so... Look, like I said earlier, I am a no stress, drama-free kind of guy. If that works for you, I'd love to take you out again. Okay. - Cool? - Yes. Yes.

I acknowledge that there are definitely some risks involved. But if I can manage to avoid some of the obviously pitfalls, I think this could be a very good thing. I don't know. "Newsline"... They're just gonna slant this whole interview to make us all look crazy. We're not negating that. We're just saying that everything has to start somewhere. When Pythagoras said theworld was round instead of flat, everybody thought he was crazy. When the Wright Brothers said they were going to build a machine that flies, everyone called them crazy.

Hey, Janice, how you feeling? I'm good. How are you? Oh... I feel great. Okay. You know, it may be the best that I have ever felt in my whole life. Glad to hear that. And you know why, Janice, it's because I'm not dying. That's good. Oh yeah, you're damn right that's good. You people told me I was dying. You let me think that I was dying! We never said you were dying. We just declined to dismiss yourbelief that you were dying. I went to my doctor, who toldme that I was perfectly healthy. And I insisted that he do test after test after test. All yielding the same result! I'm fine! That's great, Tonya. I'm happy for you. We're all happy for you that you're not dying. I just don't understand what you're trying to do here. Are you mad at us? This group... all of you, this is... this whole thing is a hoax! - Tonya... - No, you're delusional. This idea is completely delusional. What kind of cruel person lets somebody think that they're dying? - What is wrong with you guys? - Steve died! What? Steve died. The man who you met in our group, who was experiencing the same phenomenonthat you said you were. Yeah, he's dead. So, was he delusional or... Monica, enough. Enough. When did Steve die? Shortly after you met him. Later that night. What happened? Cardiac arrest. It's just like all the others. Charles, can you please turn off the camera? Cha... I'm sorry. I had no idea. And I shouldn't have come in here and dumped all over you guys. I... I owe you an apology. It's fine, Tonya. Please, have a seat. So, the good news of the day is that you're feeling better. - Correct? - Yeah. I, um... I woke up this morning, and the pain and the heaviness that was on my chest was... completely gone. Interesting. Well, tell us more about it. Being better informed about how to correctly distinguish, um, between this phenomenon would be a huge step in the right direction. Okay, um, well, last night, I... I had a bacon cheeseburger, because I thought that's the last thing I wanna eat. Way to go, Shauna. ♪ ♪ ♪ Shauna? Shauna! Shauna! You're cold. Come on, wake up, Shauna. Shauna, wake up. Wake up, baby. Shauna, wake up. Shauna, wake up. Shauna, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please, don't leave me, Shauna. Please come back, Shauna, please. Shauna. I mean, you and I are connected in a way that I can't even describe. It's like I know what's going on with you. I can feel it. I'm not going through this life by myself. I'm going through it with you. ♪ Okay, why don't we just take a second and talk to Tonya. Sure. Tonya, it's to my understanding that although you have not experienced this phenomenon directly, you're claiming to have experienced it through your twin sister? Yeah, that's right. How so? Um, well, the night that my sister Shauna died, I woke up with severe chest pains. I mean, it felt like my heart was on fire. And I happen to look at the clock, and it was around 3:20 in the morning. And later, the coroner determined that that was approximately my sister's time of death. Really? Yeah, and then the days preceding her passing, I had been experiencing frequent chest pain. And they were deliberating and excruciating. It's the truth. Her medical records confirm it. I went to the doctor to try to determine why I was in so much pain and what was happening. And my doctor ran test aftertest, and he could find nothing. There was no reason. So, the fact that Shauna died of heart failure that same night... Okay, so in your case, it's not as much about you as it is about your twin sister. If this was about Tonya, unfortunately, she'd no longer be with us. - Yeah, but... - Gloria, we're not claiming to have all the answers. We just want to open up a dialogue and have people consider the idea that somethinglike this is possible. That we as human beings are capable of a lot more than we thought. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪♪
