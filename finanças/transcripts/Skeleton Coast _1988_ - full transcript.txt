[MUSIC PLAYING] This is very secret stuff, Captain. I must insist on seeing Sekassi himself. That's not quite as easy as it might seem, Mr. Smith, not even for the CIA. Well, who do you think your benefactors are? Let us not forget that. Of course, and we are truly grateful. Perhaps in a few days I can arrange it. I do not have a few days. This is very urgent. [EXPLOSION] [GUNSHOTS] No, I couldn't get those a-holes in Washington up off their God damn butts. Yeah, they kept telling me how tough it was dealing with the Angolan government these days. Sure, and all they wanted was more time, more time. Why, hell, that's a commodity I can't buy. That's true. Right. So, listen, Rick, what we're going to do is go out on our own, just the way we planned it. Yes, of course. Now are you boys ready? That's great. All right then, I'll see you tonight, old buddy. You bet. Thank you. Bu-bye. What time you say we're getting in, Skipper? About 4 o'clock, Colonel. Uh, Skipper, here you go. That's very generous of you, Colonel. Elia? Elia? Elia? Elia? For Christ's sake, cut the drama, will you? Oh. Not that I'm complaining, but I came here to see Elia. I'm Colonel Smith. Yes, I know. I'm Opal. How do you do? And how do you know? They didn't leave very much out, did they? Well, I'm not going to ask where you got all that or why. Why? We have to be sure. Elia does have enemies, you know. A lot of people would rather see him dead than alive. So he leaves you here to check me out? Nice guy. Well, yes, he's a very cautious man. And you, I take it, are his personal assistant. I prefer to think of myself as his brains, but I'm also his wife. I beg your pardon. Still, he's a very lucky man, isn't he? Not really. He had to pay a very high price for me. But, then, he always gets full value for his money. And he likes to show me off too. He'll be here in a moment. May I pour you something? Yes, a little Jim Dean, please. Thank you. [BANGING] [DOG BARKING] Relax, Colonel. It's the boys from diamond security in the mines. They've been hunting this guy all night. He must've smuggled out a mess of diamonds. They'll recover it, of course. They always do. Thank you. My dear Colonel. Oh. How very, very nice to meet you at last. I can't tell you how much I have enjoyed our little correspondence, and how wise of you to come here. I hope my beautiful wife has made you feel at home? Yes, of course. But can we get right down to business? There is a certain urgency, you know. First, a little drink to cement our new friendship. Let us drink to the success of your very worthy mission. Cheers. Cheers. How wonderful to see you face to face. Please sit down. Come, my darling, sit beside me while we put the show on the road. Please, my dear fellow, sit down. Yeah, sure, sure. Now, what do we know? We know that my boy was taken by Angolan troops from a rebel camp. We can assume he's in a military prison someplace, but where is it? Now you take it from there. Right, your son Michael was in a place called Saltar. Was? What the hell good to me is was? But Sekassi's forces, with considerable help from your own great country, have been raiding perilously near there recently. And so they have moved him, just when I've gone to all that trouble and expense to find out where he was. Oh, and then you, of course, you were forced to go to the trouble and expense to find out where he is now. Is that it? I'm afraid so. But, of course, I knew that a gentleman of your stature would reimburse me immediately. I was going to use this for another purpose. $100,000, start talking. How very pleasant it is to do business with another gentleman. Take this. Very well. The Angolan army has taken your son to Casteo Se Jorge. That's an old Portuguese fortress. Where exactly? The map, please, sweetheart? Here, a place called Cahundo. Cahundo, huh? If it's any consolation to you, Colonel, your work is going to be much, much easier. You see, Cahundo is far closer to the border. You'll save yourself 300 miles of highly dangerous safari. Yeah, sure. Course, the fortress may perhaps be a little harder to break into, that an ordinary prison, but I'm sure to a man of your mettle, this will be no problem. Are you sure my boy is here? How good is your information? Colonel, I deal in arms, in gold, in diamonds, in women, and in secrets. I'm best with the secrets. Yes, you can be sure. As from one gentleman to another, you have my word on it. Your son is there. OK. What about the-- the hired help you'll be needing? I can supply you with some very reliable men. Mm? Oh, no, thanks. I put together my own private little army. Well, Colonel, I wish you luck. Are we going to have the pleasure of seeing you again? I'm sure of it. So glad. My wife will see you out. This way, Colonel. Oh. Please remember, money is of no importance. It's friendship that matters. And good luck with your private little army. Night. Fool. I better know you. You know me. Shit. Ha, Bill. You're a sight for sore eyes. Come on in, come in. Sit down. Come on, sit down. Sit down. OK. Old days, all over again. Yeah, just a little bit rougher around the edges this time. How's it by you, buddy? Doing great, just great. How about you? Well, now that we're on the road again, me too. But, come on, tell me about your boys. Six of the roughest sons of bitches you have ever set eyes on. I had to move 'em out into the bush because they were busting up every bar in town, attracting too much attention. How long to get them together? Just a couple of hours. Weapons are all hidden-- the gas, the explosives. Transportation's ready to roll, just got a couple stops. [RADIO RINGING] MAN (ON RADIO): Rick, Rick, come in, please. Come in. MAN (ON RADIO): The flat's being watched. Suggest you leave as soon as possible. Got you. Oh, shit, the house is being watched. I think it's time to hit the road. Get the hell out of here. You know, the last time I used this escape route, I had an irate husband banging at my door at 3 o'clock in the morning. He had this crazy idea I might be balling his wife. Might be? Listen, I want to know who the hell is it that's after us. This town's lousy with Angolan secret police. They know how to stink up a nice little town. Come on, let's get the hell out of here. Come on, Rick. Drop it. I said drop it. You know him? Secret police. Yeah, Rick, it's a sure bet those bastards are giving my boy a hard time. God, how I wish we were there like yesterday. Hey, your boy's a survivor. Don't you worry. He's going to hang tough till we get to him. But we got to leave town at night because of all the checkpoints they've got around this place. Daylight's fine once we're 50 miles or so north of here. Until then, we need dark. OK. Let's just hope that truck makes good time. Four trucks. For eight men? If we're all in one truck and we lose it, then we're in trouble. I'm sorry. Good thinking. The only way to play it, Bill. Now I'm going to get the ball rolling. I'll pick you up in the morning, take you out to meet the rest of the team. All right? OK. Walk you back to the hotel? Sure. All right, you try and get some sleep. Yeah, OK, I'll see you in the morning. All right. Oh, here, kid. How do you like that? Little kid must be working for Elia, just like everybody else. "Colonel Smith, essentially see you at once, if not before. Do not, repeat, do not enter your hotel. There is a very grave danger now. I wait for you at my place, Elia." I'll go with you. No, no, wait a minute, no. Hold. I'll tell you what, meet me there at 8 o'clock in the morning. Have the boys ready to go, OK? -All right. -Yeah. Watch yourself. Oh, don't worry about me. It seems that a man was killed tonight. He was killed near the house of someone called Rick Weston. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Now Rick is quite well-known here. He's a harmless adventurer and nobody will suspect him. But you, Colonel, I don't know. You arrived here without passport, without customs or immigration papers. And that makes you, well, a little suspect. Oh? Cheers. Cheers. Do sit down. It was you they were watching. And the assumption, therefore, is that you killed a man. Is that correct? As they say back home, I ain't talking. Mm, you didn't even bother to hide the body. That was extremely careless of you. Oh, come on, Elia. It was a secret agent from Angola. I mean, those people have enemies in every dark alley. I mean, hell, anybody could have killed him. No, no, he was not from Angola. He was a local man. To be precise, he was one of the diamond security force. You've made a very dangerous enemy, I'm afraid. Oh, brother. May I hand you your glass? Don't worry about the body. I've had it removed. It's at the bottom of the sea weighed down by concrete blocks. But, um, I have to get you out of town before they start worrying why the body hasn't reported in. Oh, it's been arranged. I'm leaving in the morning. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] One hell of a man, Colonel. Armando, mount our machine gun, all right? OK. This is Sam. You've got to be kidding. Tohsiro. Yakuza, Japanese mafia. Chuck. First class bastard. This is Blade. This is Robbins ex British commandos. Robbins, hell, it's Cedric. It's Robbins, Colonel. Oh. [LAUGHTER] OK, Bill, this is what we do. We go through the Erongo Mountains before we hit the beach. We'll never see a living soul there. Un-huh. We've checked these vehicles out good? Oh, yeah, no problem. We're going to go 50 miles to the borderline here and go inland to avoid the border patrols. And from there, it just depends on where they're holding him. Well, it's a place called Cahundo. Cahundo? Mhm. The fortress there? Yeah. Oh, my God. It's called Casteo Se Jorge. Yeah. And it would take about a dozen m-1 tanks to take that fort. I didn't say I was going to take it. You think I'm crazy enough to blow up a fortress with my son in it? No. We're going to sneak in and sneak him out. Sneak in and sneak out? Yeah. OK. Are you worried? No. Oh. Now, what about weapons? Everything you wanted and some. Gentleman, and, uh, you all know what we have to do. Let's go out and do it. Come on, you guys. What-- I can't be let go? You don't have to drag me around the-- what the hell are you guys doing? What the hell are you doing? Ah. Good to see you. All right, let's not be too obvious. They told me I'd find you here. What's going on? His name's Marcus. He's a diamond thief. We found him last night, had a cute little puppy with him. Like to see what we found in its belly? Look at that. Quarter of a million. Never seem to want to learn, do they? Not ever. They don't learn that they can't get away from them. All set, chief. You're OK to report to the office. Right. Jesus, Elia finds out what his wife up to, then it's goodbye Captain Samson. We'll find him in a garbage can with his throat cut. Ha-ha, I wouldn't mind having my throat cut for an hour with that Opal. Have you seen my wife? We know where they are now, don't you? Captain, give me a chance, for Christ's sake. Oh, you had your chance, you foolish fellow. You screwed it up, didn't you? You made me kill that sweet little puppy. You fucking bastard, I love animals and I could cut your belly open. Captain? Miss? Miss, you tell him. I ain't got the words. Tell him. It's people like me that keeps him in a job. It's my kind that gives him his work. Pays him his wages. Please, miss? It's a very amusing argument, David. Yes, it is. But I'm not interested in that kind of species of gossiping. No way. Shall you and I go for a little stroll? Why not? Is that hour of the day? My darling, it's always that hour of the day. You know that? Miss? Miss, help me. Get me out of this. You know something? You still haven't told me why you wanted to see me. About Colonel Smith. Colonel Smith? He came in here as an itinerant. That makes him a potential diamond smuggler. And we are watching him. I know. And your watcher was killed last night. But Smith's not after your diamonds. He's on his way to rescue his son who's a prisoner of the Angolans. If he's still alive, he was CIA. On the side of the rebels, supporting 'em? Right. The Angolan army captured him. Captain, for God's sake, it's murder leaving me to-- it's murder leaving me here. Captain, please. Captain-- Elia knows everything. It's his business. And what he knows, I know. And what I know, my darling, you know too. And Smith killed my man? [CHUCKLE] Here. The tide comes in very fast here, doesn't it? Yes, it does. Poor bugger's going to drown. You know, they never seem to want to learn, do they? That's what I'm here for. Part of my job. We must do this again very soon. You know how very much I love you. Yes, I suppose so. Tired? Not really. Skeleton Coast, Bill. Beautiful, huh? Yeah. We got a few more miles up here then we head back inland, back to the dunes. Whoa, 30 minutes, guys. Cup of coffee, hey? Yeah. Coffee and sandwiches, come on, guys. Sandwich, Chuck? Yeah. Damn, I can't stand stopping even for five minutes. Be patient, Bill. We're almost there. Yeah, sure. We stop for anything-- food, sleep, repairs, and all I can think of is what they're doing to my boy right now. Patience, hard to come by, buddy. Here you go. Thanks. If he isn't alive, Lieutenant, you'll be a private tomorrow. He's alive, Major. But I still think you should have a word with the doctor. I don't quite trust these [INAUDIBLE]. They never seem to know what you're asking. Well, how is he? Schmidt here thinks he's dying. That's not what I want, Doctor. He's of no use to me dead. He's not dead. Is he conscious? More or less. Hear me, Smith? Good. You're going to be questioned again soon, so let me remind you what I want to know. Sekassi is gathering his rebels for a drive to the west. Now is that just a feint or is this his so-called final offensive? This is what I must know. And you go to hell, Major. Isn't that where you belong? Fool. Throwing away your life at your age, and for what? For the rebel of their dump's bickering savages? You're a fool. You can be back home in a week. Think about it. Think about it. Keep him alive. Well, I'll be damned. What is it, Bill? Over there in that saddle bag, do you see it? Does that look like an aircraft to you? It sure as shit does. It looks like an old commander, Bill. I haven't see one of those in years. Moving out. What? What was that? Damn it, man. Don't play games with me. Tell me, tell me. That additional $100,000 from Colonel bloody Smith, it's counterfeit, paper money. [GLASS SHATTERING] [LAUGHTER] Well, Colonel Smith, if that's your bloody name and you're in the lead vehicle, we're gonna take you first, sunshine. Fire. Take cover. [LAUGHTER] Fire. Kill them bastards. [GUNSHOTS] Find him. Blade, I'm hit. Fire. Shit. How about that, Smith? Get the hell out of there. Look out now. You OK? Hey, guys, they're leaving. You bastards. That can only be Diamond Security. And why they're leaving us alive is beyond me. And without a goodbye. Guys, Chuck has been burned pretty badly. Yeah, Armando's dead. Oh, shit, and I'm as sound as a bloody bell. Blade? I'm OK. Lord takes good care of me. Well, how very nice of him. What I want to know is what's happening now. We got a desert and more desert and no transportation. Except that airplane. The what? The airplane. Bill, that plane's been there forever. Who told you? And the undercarriage is shot to hell. Well, maybe we can fix it. Planes fly on gasoline. Maybe there's some left in the tank. Maybes, maybes, that's an awful lot of maybes. All right, you talked me out of it. Now, in just a few words, tell me just where the hell we're at in relation to God damn fortress. Let me see the map. Now we're right about there, right? Yeah. OK, we got about 85 miles in the desert. That's about two and a half, three days on foot, plus a few hours sleep. We'll sleep after we get there. You heard him. All right, let's gather up all the water we can and everything else that's useful and move out. Son of a bitch. Everybody, get down. Mystery of the plane has been solved, Bill. The guy in the red scarf is one Manuel Lascado. He's a Portuguese diamond smuggler, a born killer. Claims to have gunned down more than 20 men. Yeah, and that's an operating aircraft too. We're just a few guys hanging around, nothing we couldn't handle, huh? All right, men, you all know your job. Let's go. Leave these rifles here. OK. You take care of these guns. You ready? Yeah. Hey. Hello. [NON-ENGLISH]. How are you? A little strange. Hello, senor. Well, strange, huh? What can I do for you? Well, uh, we're in a little bit a trouble. Our truck broke down and we've got to get back to town in a hurry. And we were just wondering if we could rent your airplane. I wish I could help you, senor. Unfortunately, I can do nothing. On the other hand, of course, supposing I were to ask you that I'd buy the airplane. Buy it? [LAUGHTER] Cash, strictly on the barrel head. You mean to tell me you carry that much money around with you, huh? I have to. I'm in the diamond business. I see. The diamond business. So-- oh, oh, no, no, no. No, no. How would $50,000, American money, sound to you? Huh? It's a very good plane, senor, very good plane. How does $100,000 dollars sound to you? Oh, 75 then, 75. I must insist, 100,000. Ah. All right, here we go. The keys? Stop war. Stop war. [GUNSHOTS] You OK? Yeah. All right, check out that plane. Some of you check that tent. See if there's anything in there we can use. Nice going, gang. Blade, give me a hand. Hey, Colonel, look what I found. Bring 'em along. All right. How about wrapping this up? Come on, man. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not wander. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not wander. Blade, shut up. Yeah. You'll be all right. This turned out to be one hell of a day. Come on, baby. Up, you mother. Up. End of the roadway's coming up fast. Come on, baby. Woo. Rough. Bring up the gear, Bill. Now let's see where the hell we're at. Here we go. Foul toolbox, the bastard won't open. Well, now, why don't you let me handle that? Hell, I used to open the safes over my half my life. This little baby here, it won't take but 10 seconds. How far we got to go, Colonel? Oh, not too far now. Look, Bill, we got about a half hour flight time from here right over to these mountains there. Now where is this-- where is this border here? Oh, here it is. -Right past the mountains. Yeah, I see, OK. And just like having a key. There ain't shit in here. Well, now, looky here. Diamonds, fellas. Shit. We've hit the jackpot. What? A whole big-- Christ, look at this. How many, Chuck? 53, 54, 55. No, Six. What's this one? Oh, that's a handy number. Let's see. 7 into 56, that leaves 8. So every man gets 8. Come on, divvy 'em up, Chuck. Oh, and, Chuck? CHUCK: Sir? Try not to keep the biggest for yourself, huh? Don't worry, Colonel. We're watching him. We're watching him, don't worry. We're all watching him. Gentlemen, I hope this makes you very happy. This'll please my mother in law. This is great, man. And here's for the Colonel, and for Mr. Rick. Come on, I need two more. Be patient, gentlemen. Colonel, here you go. Oh, thanks. Rick. Thank you, Sam. The mother load, huh? Chuck? Hot damn. Patience, my dear Sam, patience. [LAUGHTER] Out of nowhere, huh? Yup. OK, folks, border's coming up. They got radar and plenty of missiles too, so hang tight. [GUNSHOTS] Ah. Chief. Oh, shit, cannon. Any body hurt? I'm OK, sir. I'm OK. What's happening? We going down? I'm losing it, Bill. I'm losing it, Bill. Hang on, now. Hang on. We're going down. Brace yourself. Hold on, Bill. We're going in. Brace yourselves. Brace yourselves. Ah, come on. Oh, shit. Let's get the hell out of here before it bloody well blows. [EXPLOSION] Colonel? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Whoa-oh-oh, watch yourself. Watch yourself, boys. Sekassi. Sekassi, friends, Sekassi. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Sekassi-- hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. Hold it. Sekassi friends-- doesn't anybody speak English around here? We are friends of Sekassi-- Hey, wait a minute. Hold it. Wait a minute. Just take it easy. You all right? I'm fine. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Play it cool, boys. Play it cool. We're friends. Friends. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Colonel, I cannot tell you how sorry I am. First of all, they just don't understand. OK. Though they had all good reasons to shoot your plane down. Secondly, I fear that your son Michael is dead. What? Oh, my God, are you sure? Well, if you are asking have I seen the body, no, I have not. But he was taken by the troops of the Angolan army. Well, I already know that. You must be tired. Let's sit down a bit. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Take care of the boys, will you? Ah, as your son is CIA man, they immediately handed him over to the secret police. I know that too. But I know that my boy's alive. Even then, sir, are you sure where he might be? In the fortress at Cahundo. How good is your information, Colonel? Is it reliable? It better be. I paid-- I paid enough for it. Good stuff, huh? No. He's still not over it yet. I find it hard to believe, Colonel, that you are planning an attack on a fortress, with only 7 man. Well, let's just call it, um, an infiltration, if you will, sir. I think we can get away with it. Ah. Filtration. You know, we owe your son very so much. He's risked his life, maybe lost it, to help my aid. I feel now in return I must help yours. I have a very strong force of warriors with me. And that fort could be of such great value to us. What do you say? Well, if that's an offer, I accept, with much gratitude, sir. And one small point. That plane you stole, sir? Oh? It is a plane we all know very well. It was actually used for smuggling diamonds over the border. Oh, really? And diamonds to us, sir, mean rifles that we solely need. Oh, I can appreciate that, sir. Uh, we searched the wreckage, sir, thoroughly. No diamonds. Did you, by any chance, find some aboard? Ah, no, sir. Not by chance, but by searching. Yes, we found eight excellent stones, worth, I would say, uh, oh, at least a half a million dollars. And you, sir, may have them. Oh, 900 rifles. You have my thanks. You're welcome, sir. Well, sir, let's have the rest of the night in planning. Because you and I, we are going to take that fortress, rescue your son, or avenge him if he is dead. Yes, sir. You know something, the colonel's OK. I like him. I think he's great. Oh, hi, Sam. He's alive, I know it. I can feel it in my bones. Listen, by the way, I've elected myself as a party of one to thank you, from all of us. You giving up your share of the diamonds just to save our ass. I'll make it up to you somehow, Colonel. Thanks, Sam. And why Sam? Well, pop wanted Sam, but mom wanted Samantha. Guess who won that? [LAUGHTER] Listen, you better hit the sack. We got a lot of work ahead of us. According to the map, security's on the ground floor. God only knows where the cells are. Listen, you better give us about an hour. Very well. I will begin my bombardment at 8:15 exactly. My cannon first, a direct attack on the subway. Followed after a 10 minute interval by heavy mission gunfire. By the time, I propose we show ourselves. Do you think it's wise to do that, General? I must do it, Colonel. They'll never come after us unless we present a very tempting target. Yes, but they're going to come after that cannon whether you show yourselves or not. Let us make certain by showing them how few we are. I must go now and make myself a soldier again. I look forward to the pleasure of seeing you again. And my son. Yes, and your son. God bless. All right, troops, listen. We're not supposed to be the most professional soldiers in the world, you hear? So just kind of saunter along, you know, stroll, easy. Chuck, are you all tied up? Tight as I can, sir. All right, let's get the hell in there and go. Hablas ingles, senorita? Do you speak English, young lady? Yes, Senor Coronel, of course. Ah, well, who is the head of security here? Major Schneider, sir. I wish to see him at once. I'll see if he's free, sir. There's a colonel here to see you here, Major. [CLEARS THROAT] I am Colonel Amadeus Zorilla, out of 3rd brigade. And we are coming down here now. But I see that you are an aficionado of boxing, ha-ha, which I am myself. Aficionado? I myself am a boxer. Had my motherland not called me to matters of national importance, I could have become a world champion. Now just what is it that you want to see me about? Oh, two of our men caught a spy in our uniform. And he was working for that rebel, Sekassi. I have already found that he was being paid by the Americanos, which means, no doubt, the CIA. Hm, I'm glad to hear our Cuban friends are so efficient. What did you hope to find here, you miserable fellow? Hm? Does this ape speak English? He's Americano. Hm. Well, I'm sure we can persuade him to answer a few questions. You rang, Major? Of course I rang, idiot. Otherwise, why are you here? Yeah, Major. We have another CIA man on our hands. Escort the Colonel, show them where the cells are. Major. Thank you, Colonel. Colonel Guerrilla, is it? Zorilla. Zorilla. Yes, of course. Well, you'll forgive me. I'm, uh, very busy. It has been my pleasure. I hope we shall meet again soon. It's possible. God damn it. Why was I not informed the 3rd brigade was moving in? They're not? Well, do you have an officer list? I want to know everything there is about one Colonel Amadeus Zorilla, a Cuban field commander, according to his uniform. [LAUGHTER] Are we now under the north tower. --[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], Colonel, the south tower. The major likes to keep his special prisoners here. The walls are damper. It, uh, weakens the spirit faster, yeah? Ah. Good, good. Guards? Guards? All right. We've been invaded by commandos. Get to the cells. Kill everybody in the corridors. Lieutenant Smith is with them. Avoid him if possible. All right, let's move out. We'll put him in here, Colonel. Yeah. The major said another CIA man. You, uh, have one here now? It's a traitor, Colonel. We've had him a very long time, but we can't make him talk. But I have a little surprise for him tomorrow that should make him more amenable. Oh? Your cells here are all full. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], Colonel. About half of them. Lieutenant Smith? [GUNSHOTS] Fire. No, don't shoot. They're with me, Schneider. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Shit, Colonel, we got a dead end. God damn it. There's our way out. Christ. Bill, we got to go up. All right, look. We'll go up. Once you guys are clear, I want you to vamoose and find Sekassi. He'll help you. I'm not going to risk your lives anymore. What? You want to leave you, Michael, and Chuck here? Oh. OK, guys, who wants to bail out now? Come on. Oh, you bastards. All, right, let's go. Come on. Come on, Sam. There you go. Hey, Colonel, we found a way down. Come on, guys. Hey. [GUNSHOTS] Thanks, Rick. Nice work, Sam. Now where the hell are we? Shit, I hope I don't have to duke it out with you. You won't have to if you play your cards right. Hey, this corridor looks like the same one that took us into the cell area. Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. Ah. So you're still at your post, soldier. Yes, sir. I don't move from here. The fortress fall down, I don't move. You will now because we are checking on the prisoners. If they are wounded, we have to take them to the hospital ward. So you come. Yes, sir. Go ahead. Open that one first. Now get the next one. Yeah. Hey, what the hell's going on in there? I need some clothes and a stretcher. OK, I'll see what I can find. Michael? Dad? Oh, Michael. Michael. It's Dad, Michael. It's Dad, buddy. Dad? Michael, come on. You're not going to quit on me now, are you, buddy? Huh? Not after all you've been through. No. No. Dad. I know, son. All right. We're going home. We're going home. No. Yeah. Well, where in the hell have you been? You marched me into this hell hole, playing like I'm a prisoner. Got me sitting around with the rats and the roaches. I'm getting real bored. And I thought you would have escaped by now. I guess you're losing your touch, huh? Yeah, I must be. How's the battle going? Good guys winning? That's us, Rick. So far, so good. But we've got a long way to go. We're not home yet. But you can relax, junior. You got me with you now. Let's go get 'em. I like that. Ha-ha-ha. Fellas, my son, Michael. Don't worry, son. We'll look after you. All right, what's cooking? We got everybody but Sam. Where's Sam? She's gone for a stretcher. Let's get the hell out of here, quickly. [SCREAMING] [LAUGHTER] You'll drop your weapons now. All of you. You harm one hair of her head, and I will-- You'll what, Colonel Guerrilla? Open fire? Let's see what happens. We can all die now, or we can talk. What the hell good will talking do? We could come up with some arrangement. What kind of an arrangement? I might, repeat, might, spare your lives in exchange for information. And we can depend on that, huh? As I said before, you have an alternative. Open fire. Shit, Bill. I think he's got us by the short hairs. Now, Major? No, you fool. Spared by you, commando. Right, take them to the interrogation room. Guards, follow me. The girl stays with me, just in case you get any foolish ideas. Come on, boys. Once, half of Africa was German. And these whipping posts were everywhere. They were necessary then, and they still are, as life must be lived with discipline. And now, for business. Your name? William Smith, Colonel, United States Marine Corps, retired. Another Smith. He's my son. That answers my second question, why you came here to try, obviously, to rescue him. Did it not occur to you that this might be a mindless endeavor? We didn't think so at the time. Mhm, and now? I lost, but I'd do it again. And these other men, are they Marines too? They're mercenaries. Ah, an allegedly romantic occupation. And the attack on the fort, that was timed with your operation? Yes, it was. Sekassi? Sekassi. How many men were there? I don't know that. And this was all part of the so-called long expected final offensive? I don't know that either. Colonel, if I even suspect you of lying, this lovely young lady could become a live punching bag. This hand could-- could destroy your lovely rib cage. Of course, I never would do that to such an enticing body. Sekassi-- Tell me about his weaponry. Unfortunately, mostly spears. Is he capable of moving west and against us? Mostly spears? I don't know Sekassi's grand strategy. Well, estimate. Soldier to soldier. I don't think I like that comparison either, mister. But if I were Sekassi, I'd drive straight through to Luanda. The capital? With spears? You're as mad as he is. We're both very determined men. Determination can lead to brilliant victories, and, also, appalling defeats. And that's all I know. That I do not believe. What if I execute your men? What do you want with us? And your woman, too, huh? Unless, of course, I choose to use her a little while, until I am done. Because that is exactly what I intend to do, unless you tell me a great deal more. Spineless. Major, why don't you tell your pet monkey to leave him alone? Poor devil's more dead than alive. My pet monkey? You prefer another word? Oh, God. Ape. Ape. Yes, a better word. [GUNSHOTS] Jesus Christ. You OK? Yeah, I got myself a slug in the shoulder, sore. Thanks, Tohs. Come on, boy, answer up. I'm OK. I think Chuck needs some help though. He's pretty bad. We'll make do. Oh, I caught a good one too, Colonel. All right, Tohs, you and Robbins, grab a couple of those stretchers over there. Let's find out who's walking and running, and let's get the hell out of here, huh? You all right, son? Yeah, yeah, I'm all right. Colonel, we heard some firing. How very alert of you, Sergeant. But because of the stress of the attack and this fortress, that lieutenant and his men revolted. Ah, but we put down the rebellion, but too late, unfortunately, to prevent the murder of our beloved commander of security, Major Schneider. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. It was him. This and other Americana. Pull him out, sir. My captain was very badly wounded. He said I must give this to senior officer. He says you know what it means. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Of course. And, sergeant, clean up this mess, huh? Forward, forward. How much longer, for Christ's sakes? Hell, I don't know. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll meet up with Sekassi's men. I thought they'd be all around us by now. Bill, we got Trouble, 3 o'clock. Well, hell. I guess we can all do with one more damn [INAUDIBLE]. Chuck, back. Chuck. Keep moving, keep moving. We're on their side, remember? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Lower stretchers. Pardon, sir. I thought for a moment you were rebels. Do I look like a rebel, Captain? No, sir. We are a little tired. So I will take some of your men to carry the stretchers. Yes, sir. Majidas, Sora. Ready, sir. Forward march. Sir, if you would tell me, where are we going? To outpost four, Captain. Outpost four? I don't think I know where that is. Well, outpost four is where the major is going to meet us. The major, Captain, is the head of security. You don't believe that he would allow his whereabouts to filter down to the junior ranks of the officer corps? No, sir. Of course not, sir. Oh. Bueno, forward. Halt here. Rebels. Lay down your weapons, Captain. You're outnumbered. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Ha, I welcome you, my friend. Your mission? Well, we were all hurt, but we came out alive, including my boy. Our mission has been accomplished, sir. Oh, boy. Woo. You tell me, sir, how we can find our way back to civilization. Well, I'll suggest we go to the airport, Villa Rosados. My men took it last night. My men would have word to watch for you. You can hail my medics there too. They'll patch you up. Oh, wonderful. Wonderful. How far is that, sir? About 207 miles. Listen, how do you suggest we get there? I mean, you wouldn't have an old truck hanging around, would you? We're just a little footsore. You'll come with me. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Come on this way, fellas. Let's go. Well, here we are. Hold it. OK. Where are we? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Holy jumping Jehosaphat. Ho-ho. Oh, look at this. 207 miles on a Rolls Royce? Wow. Hey, but does it run? Try it. [CHEERING] In a Rolls Royce. Do you think we'll meet again? Who knows, my friend. If not, I'm glad we met for one brief moment in history. My friend, the day I met you was one of the finest days of my life. I thank you, and God bless you. Go with God. You bet. He's around here some place. I think we need a push. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Come on, baby. Come on. [CHEERING] You can stretch, boys. Come on, Michael, you too. Hey, guys, look what he left us. Hey, Tohs, break out that ammo that you've been lugging all over the place, will you? Champagne. All right. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Diamonds. Diamonds, wow. It looks like a giant foreign currency. Yeah, maybe even blow their economy to hell. God, I think we hit the jackpot, fellas. [LAUGHTER] God damn, I almost forgot. Sekassi can sure as hell use these. Oh, what the hell.
