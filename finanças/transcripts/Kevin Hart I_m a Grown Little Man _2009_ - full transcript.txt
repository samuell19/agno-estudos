SHE CAN'T EVEN TALK, SHE KNOW A COUPLE WORDS, RIGHT, SHE CAN PUT A COUPLE SENTENCES TOGETHER. BUT IT'S LIKE EVERY TIME I TELL HER SOMETHING SHE ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY BACK. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT I SAY, SHE ALWAYS GOTTA GIVE ME SOMETHING BACK. AND IT MAKE ME MAD, WE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT OVER JUICE THE OTHER DAY.

THAT'S MY DAUGHTER, MAN. I'M SO PROTECTIVE OF MY KIDS, THOUGH, I REALLY AM. I DON'T EVEN LIKE TAKING MY KIDS OUT THAT MUCH NO MORE. '‘CAUSE I GET INTO ARGUMENTS WITH THE OTHER KIDS. I THINK KIDS PLAY TOO ROUGH, I DO. ME AND THIS BOY GOT INTO IT AT CHUCK E. CHEESE. IT WASN'T-- IT WASN'T A FIGHT, IT WAS AN ALTERCATION.

MY DAUGHTER SO DAMN STUPID SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A GAME. SHE PLAYIN'. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) HA-HA, SHE LIKE, "“DADDY, LOOK!"” SO I'M GETTIN' MAD, I'M LIKE, "“THROW A BALL BACK!"” I'M PISSED OFF, I LOOK AT MY SON, HE JUST LOOKIN' AT THE SHIT, HE-- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I WAS MAD AT THE WAY MY FAMILY LOOKED AS A UNIT. LIKE WE--WE DIDN'T LOOK GOOD AS A UNIT, MAN, LIKE--MY DAUGHTER, SHE TAKIN' BALLS TO THE FACE, MY SON SHAKIN' HIS HEAD AND SLOBBERIN', I'M SMALL. WE LOOK LIKE A FUCKIN' CIRCUS ACT. I WAS SO PISSED OFF. I GOT--I'VE NEVER BEEN SO MAD AT MY WIFE IN MY LIFE. I WAS LIKE, "“WHY WOULD YOU DRESS US IN DIFFERENT COLORS? WE LOOK LIKE CLOWNS. FROM NOW ON, SOLID COLORS WHEN WE GO OUT, WE LOOK LIKE A TEAM, SOLID COLORS."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) MY DAMN KIDS, THOUGH, MAN. YOU GOTTA ACCEPT YOUR-- ACCEPT WHAT YOU HAVE. ACCEPT THE LIFE THAT YOU CHOSE. I DON'T MIND THE PRESSURE THAT COMES WITH KIDS, THOUGH. I CAN TAKE THAT PRESSURE. I DON'T LIKE THE PRESSURE THAT WOMEN PUT ON MEN. I THINK WOMEN PUT WAY TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON MEN, THEY DO. Y'ALL DON'T EVEN REALIZE HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU PUT ON MEN. IS THAT YOUR LADY RIGHT THERE, MAN? ALL RIGHT, HOW LONG Y'ALL BEEN TOGETHER? ALL RIGHT, SO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY "“PRESSURE"”. SHE EXPECTS A LOT FROM YOU, SHE WANTS YOU TO, TO PROVIDE FOR HER, AND PROTECT HER, WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT, SHE DO. LIKE RIGHT NOW, IF A FIRE BREAK OUT RIGHT NOW, BIG ASS FIRE, POOF! GO UP IN FLAMES, FIRST THING SHE GONNA DO IS LOOK AT YOU. "“LIKE, OH!"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“UH, HMM?"” YOU GOTTA COME UP WITH A PLAN IN HER MIND. YOU KNOW, "“BABY, GET ON MY BACK, I'M GONNA BUST US OUT OF HERE."” SHE WANT TO-- SHE WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT. "“BITCH, YOU BETTER STOP, DROP AND ROLL, AND FIND THAT EXIT. I'M SCARED TOO."” BUT THAT'S WHAT WOMEN WANT. WOMEN LIKE THAT SECURITY. I'M A GREAT PROVIDER, I GOT MONEY, I CAN PAY FOR STUFF, I DON'T MIND THAT. I'M NOT A PROTECTOR. THAT'S WHERE, THAT'S WHERE, I'M LIKE NOT THAT GUY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE WOMEN, YOU WANT EVERY GUY TO FIGHT FOR YOU, THAT'S NOT ME, I'M NOT A FIGHTER. I WON'T SAY THAT I AM, I WILL NEVER PRETEND TO BE. THAT'S NOT WHO I AM. PRIME EXAMPLE, LETS SAY ME AND YOU GO TO THE MOVIES, RIGHT? WE AT THE MOVIES, WE HAVIN' A GOOD TIME. OUT OF NOWHERE SOME GUY COME UP, SMACK YOU IN THE FACE REAL HARD. IF YOU WITH ME THEN YOU JUST GOT SMACKED, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT JUST-- I'M BEING HONEST, ALL RIGHT? I'M NOT, I'M NOT GONNA DO NOTHIN' ABOUT IT. NOW, WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT WHEN WE GET IN THE CAR, LET'S, LET'S FIGURE OUT WHY IT HAPPENED, AND, AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. BUT, AS FAR AS ME LIKE JUST GOING AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT, I'M NOT GONNA FUCKIN' DO IT. BECAUSE IF HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FACE, I KNOW HE DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT MINE. THAT'S, THAT'S COMMON SENSE. TWO, TWO BLACK EYES AIN'T GONNA GET US HOME. SOMEBODY GOT TO DRIVE, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOOD AT. I'M A WITNESS, I SAW EVERYTHING. WHEN, WHEN HE HIT YOU I GOT BEHIND THE VENDING MACHINE '‘CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KNOW THAT WE WERE TOGETHER, IT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS WHO I'M WITH. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KICKED YOU WHEN YOU FELL, THAT, THAT'S WHERE I GOT UPSET '‘CAUSE YOU GAVE UP. YOU DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT NO MORE. WHY WOULD HE PUT HIS BOOT TO YOUR FACE? THAT'S JUST DISGUSTING TO ME. HE SHOULD BE SHOT. SEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE GET KNOCKED OUT, THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE TO FIGHT, MAN. YOU EVER SEE SOMEBODY GET KNOCKED OUT, MAN? LIKE KNOCKED OUT, I'M TALKIN' ABOUT IN PERSON. LIKE YOU, YOU WITNESSED SOMEBODY GET KNOCKED THE HELL OUT. IT CHANGES YOUR OPINION ON FIGHTING, DOESN'T IT? WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY GET KNOCKED OUT, YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT NO MORE. LIKE DAMN, THAT SHIT LOOK LIKE IT HURT. I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO-- I SAW SOMEBODY GET KNOCKED OUT, ME AND MY BOY WE AT A CLUB, RIGHT? WE HAVIN'A GOOD TIME, WE PARTYIN'. MM, MM, GET MONEY. MM, MM, GET MONEY. WE HAVIN' A GOOD TIME, RIGHT? OUT OF NOWHERE-- THAT'S HOW WE PARTY, '‘CAUSE WE BOTH SMALL, WE DON'T-- I DON'T HANG WITH TALL PEOPLE. IT WAS JUST US. MM, MM--RIGHT? SO, OUT OF NOWHERE HE GET INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH THIS GUY AT THE BAR, THE GUY AT THE BAR GOT MAD, PUNCHED MY BOY IN THE FACE--BOW! SOON AS HE HIT HIM, MY FRIEND FELL ASLEEP. (SNORING SOUNDS) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) NOW, WHEN HE WOKE UP HE GOT MAD AT ME, HE WAS LIKE, "“KEV, HOW COME YOU AIN'T GET HIM?"” AND I WAS LIKE, "“YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S SOME SELFISH SHIT BECAUSE I JUST SAW WHAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE HE, HE MADE YOU GO TO SLEEP, I'M NOT TIRED, I'M WIDE AWAKE. I TOOK A NAP. WHY WOULD I WALK RIGHT INTO THAT ASS-WHUPPIN'? THAT'S STUPID. IF HE HIT ME AND I GO TO SLEEP, WHO GONNA WAKE WHO UP, YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYIN'?"” I DON'T, I DON'T WANT THAT PROBLEM. AIN'T NOBODY TRYIN' TO FALL ASLEEP AT A BAR, THAT'S HOW YOU GET RAPED. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE PERCENTAGES OF RAPE HAPPEN WHEN PEOPLE FALL ASLEEP AT A BAR. I PROMISE YOU. I'M JUST TELLIN' Y'ALL THE STUFF THAT I KNOW. I SAW MY UNCLE GET KNOCKED OUT ONE TIME. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FUNNIEST SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. WE WAS AT A FAMILY REUNION. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A FAMILY REUNION, IT'S A PICNIC. THERE'S KIDS AND SHIT AROUND, IT'S A TIME FOR FUN. MY UNCLE GOT DRUNK, HE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH THIS GUY OVER PICNIC SPACE. HE WAS LIKE, "“HEY, MAN, YOU AND YOUR KIDS, Y'ALL NOT NO HARTS, Y'ALL NEED TO GET THE HELL OUT THIS PICNIC SPACE."” AND THE GUY WAS, YOU KNOW, THE GUY WAS LIKE, "“LOOK, DUDE, I DON'T MIND MOVING, BUT DON'T CURSE AT ME IN FRONT OF MY KIDS."” AND MY UNCLE'S DRUNK, HE WENT TO CURSE AGAIN, BEFORE HE GOT IT OUT THE GUY HIT HIM. YOU EVER SEE SOMEBODY GET HIT SO HARD THEY TRY TO GRAB EVERYTHING ON THE WAY DOWN? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) IT HAPPENED SO FAST, HE WAS LIKE, MY UNCLE WAS LIKE, "“LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, FUCK YOU--"” (LOUD THUMP) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THE SHIT THAT MADE ME LAUGH IS THAT HE WAS LOOKIN' AT HIM THE WHOLE WAY DOWN. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I WAS LIKE, "“JUST GO DOWN, FALL, SHIT, MAN, YOU'RE MESSIN' UP THE PICNIC."” CHANGE CAME OUT HIS POCKET. I AIN'T NEVER SEEN SOMEBODY GET HIT SO HARD THAT CHANGE COME OUT THEY JEANS WHEN THEY STANDIN' UP. YOU KNOW HOW HARD A NIGGA GOTTA HIT YOU FOR LOOSE CHANGE TO COME OUT YOUR JEANS? SOON AS HE GOT HIT, 35 CENT FLEW OUT HIS POCKET. IT WAS LIKE-- BOW, MONEY! I SAID, "“GODDAMN. HE JUST KNOCKED 35 CENTS OUTTA UNCLE RICH'S JEAN POCKET."” I AIN'T NEVER SEEN NOBODY GET HIT THAT HARD. THESE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN. I'VE WITNESSED THIS, MAN. YOU GOTTA KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS AN INDIVIDUAL, IF YOU'RE NOT A FIGHTER, UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE NOT A FIGHTER. I KNOW I'M NOT A FIGHTER, THAT'S WHY I CARRY A WHISTLE. I'LL BLOW THE SHIT OUT OF A WHISTLE IN SOMEBODY FACE. FUCK WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO, YOU GONNA WIN THE FIGHT, BUT YOU AIN'T GONNA HEAR SHIT TOMORROW, BITCH. (WHISTLING) PUT THAT WHISTLE IN YOUR FACE, BITCH. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FIGHT A WHISTLE. GOTTA KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT, WHAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT. I'M A GOOD ARGUER. I CAN ARGUE. BUT I ALSO-- YOU ALSO GOTTA KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF THINGS WHEN YOU ARGUE. YOU EVER ARGUE WITH SOMEBODY, AND THEN THEY GET UP, AND THEN YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW, YOU FEEL A LITTLE DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FIGHT? YOU GOTTA KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF IT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT WHEN YOU DON'T THINK YOU GONNA WIN. THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO LET A PERSON KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT READY TO FIGHT. I WAS ARGUING WITH THIS GUY, WE AT A CLUB, HE'S SITTIN' DOWN, I'M LIKE, "“DUDE,"” I SAID, "“YOU KNOW WHAT, SAY SOMETHING ELSE TO ME, I PROMISE YOU, I'MA SMACK THE SHIT OUT YOU. AND I MEAN THAT, SAY SOMETHIN' ELSE, I'MA SMACK THE SHIT OUT YOU."” LIKE, THAT'S MY THUG LOOK RIGHT THERE. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW THUGS GET TO CLAPPIN' THEIR HANDS AND STAND UP? "“SAY SOMETHING ELSE, ON EVERYTHING I LOVE I'MA SMACK THE SHIT OUT YOU, B, FOR REAL."” AND HE GOT UP, AND HE WAS BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT HE WAS. I WAS LIKE, "“COME ON, GIVE ME A HUG, BRING IT IN."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“I'M SERIOUS, THIS IS STUPID. COME ON, MAN. THERE'S NO REASON FOR US TO-- YOU CAN'T FIGHT NOBODY DOING THIS. COME ON, MAN."” THERE'S WAYS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT. I GOT ONE FIGHT MOVE. IF YOU GET PAST THAT, I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I'M CONFUSED. I'M GONNA LET Y'ALL SEE SOME CLASSIFIED SHIT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS CLASSIFIED, OKAY? THIS IS MY FIGHT MOVE. "“WHAT? WHO YOU TALKIN' TO?"” DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH, THIS IS SERIOUS. ALL RIGHT? THIS IS SERIOUS RIGHT NOW. I'M ABOUT TO SHOW Y'ALL MY FIGHT MOVE, ALL RIGHT? "“WHAT? WHO YOU TALKIN' TO? DUDE, YOU DON'T KNOW ME-- DON'T, DON'T TALK LIKE YOU KNOW ME! BITCH, SAY SOMETHIN' ELSE, SAY SOME--"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THAT'S IT. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S IT. IT'S REAL QUICK. THAT'S CLASSIFIED, ALL RIGHT? I'LL SHOW Y'ALL ONE MORE TIME. YOU GET ONE MORE PEEK AT IT, I'MA GIVE Y'ALL ONE MORE CHANCE TO SEE IT, ALL RIGHT? IT'S REAL QUICK. "“WHAT? WHO YOU TALKIN' TO? DUDE, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW-- SAY SOMETHIN'-- SAY SOMETHIN' ELSE!"” THAT'S IT, THAT'S ALL-- THAT'S ALL IT IS. IT'S A QUICK SHUFFLE OF THE FEET, THAT'S ALL I GOT. IF YOU GET PAST THAT, I'M DONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IT CONFUSES PEOPLE. YOU CAN EITHER THINK I'M ABOUT TO KICK YOU, PUNCH YOU, HAPPY FEET, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS THAT COME ACROSS WITH THAT MOVE. (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) (OFFSCREEN) -FEMALE #1: OH SHIT! -YOU GOTTA KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT AS AN INDIVIDUAL, MAN. I DON'T KNOW, I'M GOOD AT SEEING THINGS, I'M GOOD AT NOTICING THINGS. LIKE, I REMEMBER, ONE OF MY FRIENDS GOT JUMPED ONE TIME. AND I WAS WITH HIM, I RAN. THE REASON WHY I RAN, IS BECAUSE I SAW IT COMIN'. LIKE YOU KNOW, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE STUFF COMING, YOU START TO BREAK IT DOWN ON YOUR OWN? "“WAIT A MIN-- OH SHIT, WAIT, OH NO, THIS DON'T LOOK GOOD. THEY LOOK ANGRY. OH!"” I TOOK OFF. I'MA TELL YOU WHAT'S BAD ABOUT RUNNIN' ON SOMEBODY. IT'S REAL BAD WHEN YOU RUN ON SOMEBODY, AND THEY SURVIVE THE JUMPING. LIKE, LIKE, LIKE-- '‘CAUSE THEN WHEN YOU SEE '‘EM, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM. I WAS LIKE, "“HEY! LOOK WHO'S ALIVE, HEY, MAN! HOW'D YOU MAKE IT OUT OF THERE? UP TOP! NO, NOTHING? ALL RIGHT."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“NO, UP TOP, NOTHING? ALL RIGHT."” I SAW, I SAW SOMEBODY GET KICKED IN THE FACE BEFORE, THAT SHIT WAS FUNNY. I THINK IF YOU GET KICKED IN THE FACE YOU DESERVED IT, BECAUSE THAT MEAN THAT YOU WATCHED THE FOOT COME TO YOUR FACE. GOT TO BE A ASSHOLE TO FIGHT SOMEBODY USING THEY FEET. THE PERSON I SAW GET KICKED IN THE FACE, THE REASON WHY I LAUGHED IS BECAUSE WHEN HE GOT KICKED HE LOOKED AT US FOR CONFIRMATION. LIKE HE, LIKE HE NEEDED APPROVAL ON WHAT JUST HAPPENED. HE'S LIKE, "“AH-- YO, SHIT, YO!"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“IT WAS HIM, YEAH, IT WAS--"” BETTER LOOK AT HIS OTHER FOOT BEFORE HE KICKS YOU AGAIN, HE'S GOOD, THAT GUY'S GOOD. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. WOULD YOU FIGHT SOMEBODY USING THEIR FEET, MAN? LIKE, IF WE GONNA FIGHT, I'M GONNA TELL YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP. PUT YOUR HANDS UP, LET'S FIGHT. NOW, IF I GO TO FIGHT YOU, AND YOU START STRETCHIN'-- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THAT MEAN YOU KNOW SOME SHIT I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU. I HAD A INCIDENT WHERE A GUY STARTED-- WELL, HE TRIED, HE DIDN'T USE IT ON ME, BUT HE WAS GONNA ATTEMPT TO USE HIS FEET. I WAS WITH MY MOM, RIGHT? ME AND MY MOM, WE IN THE PARKING LOT OF BEST BUY, I'M LOOKIN' FOR A PARKING SPACE. NOW, ALL THE SPACES WAS TOOKEN, BUT THERE WAS ONE TRUCK ABOUT TO BACK INTO THIS PARKING SPOT BUT HE WAS TAKING TOO LONG, SO I GOT MAD, I STOLE IT. I WHIPPED INTO THE SPOT REAL FAST. AH, AH. LIKE, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE WRONG '‘CAUSE YOU PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN, AND ROLL YOUR WINDOWS UP. YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT HIM, YOU START HUMMING-- (HUMMING) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) OUT OF NOWHERE, THE GUY GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK, HE WAS LIKE, "“YO, MAN, I KNOW YOU SAW ME ABOUT TO BACK INTO THAT SPOT. EITHER YOU BACK OUT, OR WE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM."” CHINESE GUY, ALL RIGHT? NOW, I'M WITH MY MOM, SO I AIN'T GONNA BE NO BITCH. I WAS LIKE, "“WELL, I GUESS WE GOT A PROBLEM."” THIS IS HOW I KNOW I DIDN'T WANT THIS PROBLEM. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID TO ME. HE WAS LIKE, "“OH, SO WE GOT A PROBLEM? HM, DO WE?"” (SLAPPING SOUNDS) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“NO."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“GET, GET IN THE CAR, GET IN THE CAR, MOM."” ANYBODY THAT SMACK THEY KNEES TWICE IS AN ASSASSIN. THEY ABOUT TO KICK YOUR GODDAMN TEMPLE OFF YOUR FACE, THAT'S WHAT HE ABOUT TO DO. MY MOM TRYING-- "“WHY WE--"” "“GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR BEFORE HE KILL US, MOM!"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) KNOW WHO TO FIGHT, AND WHO NOT TO FIGHT, MAN. I WOULD LOVE TO BE A THUG. I SWEAR I WISH I COULD BE A THUG. I DON'T HAVE IT IN ME. LIKE, I DON'T HAVE THOSE THUG QUALITIES IN ME. I WAS ACTUALLY TALKING TO THIS THUG DUDE, I WAS IN D.C. NOT TOO LONG AGO, RIGHT? AND, I TALKED TO THIS GUY, WE MIGHT HAVE TALKED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. I SWEAR TO YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE TALKIN' ABOUT. BUT HE WAS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE STUFF THAT HE WAS SAYING, THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY I STAYED THERE TO LISTEN. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID, IT'S NOT EVEN A JOKE, THIS IS EXACTLY HOW HE WAS TALKIN' TO ME. HE'S LIKE, "“YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I'M TALKIN' TO THE DUDE, RIGHT, ME AND HIM, WE TALKIN'-- HE TALKIN'-- '‘WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, RIGHT, RIGHT,' SO I'M LIKE, '‘AHH, AHH, RIGHT?' YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

WHO--WHO--WAIT-- I WAS SO CONFUSED I THOUGHT I WAS A WITNESS, I SAID, "“DID I SEE THIS? WAS I THERE? I, I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT, IS WHAT I'M SAYING."” I NEVER BEEN SO AFRAID IN MY LIFE, MAN. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I JUST DON'T DO GOOD WITH THUG STUFF. THUG ACTIVITY. I HAD ONE THUG DUDE TELL ME HE WAS GONNA POP THE TRUNK ON ME ONE TIME. HE'S LIKE, "“SAY SOMETHIN' ELSE, I'M GONNA POP THE TRUNK ON YOUR BITCH ASS."” EVERYBODY RAN. I WAS LIKE, "“WELL, WHERE'D YOU PARK?"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS CRAZY. "“MAN, GET OUT OF THERE!"” "“I JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR IT WAS, I CAN-- I MIGHT NOT HAVE TO RUN, WE COULD CATCH A TRAIN AND STILL GET HOME."” (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) WISH I COULD BE A RAPPER OR SOME SHIT. I REALLY DO. YOU KNOW WHY I CAN'T BE A RAPPER, THOUGH, MAN? '‘CAUSE MY VOICE AIN'T DEEP ENOUGH.

I DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY. SO WE GO, WE GO, WE GET THERE. THEY GOT THE DOLPHINS IN THIS TANK. THERE'S LIKE EIGHT DOLPHINS IN THIS TANK, RIGHT? WHEN I GET THERE, I SEE THIS OLD LADY ON THE BACK OF A DOLPHIN, I SEE THIS LITTLE BOY, AND I'M LIKE, "“YOU KNOW WHAT, BABE, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERREACTING.

SO WHENEVER YOU READY GRAB ITS FIN."” I WAS LIKE, "“ALL RIGHT, COOL, I'M READY."” SOON AS I GRAB MY DOLPHIN FIN, MY DOLPHIN WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK. LIKE HE JUST, HE JUST WENT DOWN. SO, SO BECAUSE I WAS SCARED, I DIDN'T LET GO, I HELD ON. LIKE--YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SCARED HOW YOU START TO MENTALLY CREATE SHIT IN YOUR OWN MIND? I WAS LIKE, "“OKAY, IT'S OBVIOUS THAT I GOT A RACIST DOLPHIN. HE DON'T--HE DON'T LIKE BLACK PEOPLE. HE DONE, HE DONE CUT A DEAL WITH A SHARK, BRING HIM A BLACK PIECE OF MEAT, SOMETHING BAD ABOUT TO HAPPEN, RIGHT? SO I LET GO, I GET TO THE TOP. WHEN I LET GO, I'M SO SCARED I START SNAPPIN' ON THE INSTRUCTOR AS SOON AS I SEE HIM. I WAS LIKE, "“NOBODY SAW FUCKIN' DOLPHIN NUMBER EIGHT MISSING, HUH? HUH? Y--Y'ALL DIDN'T NOTICE I WAS GONE FOR LIKE 30 SECONDS? HE TRIED TO KILL ME! HE TRIED TO KILL ME!"” I WAS MAD, YO, I WAS SO FUCKIN' SCARED, I LIKE, "“Y'ALL SEE THE OLD LAD, AND THE LITTLE BOY, BUT NOBODY SAW THE BLACK FUCKIN' SWIRL MISSING, HUH? NOBODY NOTICED THAT THE BLACK DOT WASN'T GOING AROUND? Y'ALL DIDN'T NOTICE THAT?"” HE'S LIKE, "“CALM DOWN, MAN. CALM DOWN! IT'S THREE FEET, JUST STAND UP."” I WAS LIKE, "“WHAT? WHAT'D HE SAY?"” I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THAT I WAS WALKIN' AND TALKIN' SHIT AT THE SAME TIME. COME TO FIND OUT, I NEVER EVEN WENT UNDERWATER. WHAT HAPPENED WAS SOME WATER SPLASHED IN MY FACE AND I PANICKED. "“OH, OH, OH!"” MADE IT UP, MADE IT ALL UP. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I WAS SCARED. I NEVER LIED THAT FAST IN MY LIFE. HE WAS RACIST THOUGH, I KNOW HE WAS RACIST. YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW HE WAS RACIST? '‘CAUSE WHEN I GOT OUT THE WATER, YOU NOW KNOW HOW DOLPHINS LIKE-- (DOLPHIN SOUNDS) THEY BE DOING THAT, LIKE-- WELL, HE LOOKED AT ME, HE'S LIKE, "“NIGGA, NIGGA--"” AND I WAS LIKE, "“W-WHAT?"” BLEW MY WHISTLE IN HIS FACE. I DON'T PLAY THAT SHIT. HE DON'T WORK THERE, I GOT HIM FIRED. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I KNOW PEOPLE. WHAT ELSE DON'T I LIKE? I DON'T LIKE OSTRICHES. I'M SCARED OF OSTRICHES. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT A OSTRICH IS, IT'S A BIG ASS BIRD, THAT'S THE SAME SIZE AS ME. THE BIRDS ARE HUGE, OKAY? I'M IN NEBRASKA, DOING A SHOW IN NEBRASKA, I HAD TO PEE, SO I'M ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, I'M PEEING, RIGHT? I GET DONE PEEING, I LOOK TO MY LEFT, IT'S A BIG ASS OSTRICH LOOKIN' AT ME WHILE I'M PEEIN'. HE WAS STANDING ON ONE LEG LIKE THIS, HIS BODY WAS FACING THIS WAY, BUT HIS HEAD, HIS HEAD WAS LIKE THIS. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) NOW, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SO I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. MY FRIEND GOT OUT THE CAR, HE'S LIKE, "“YO, WHAT'S THAT?"” I WAS LIKE, "“I DON'T KNOW. LOOKS LIKE A BIG ASS MAN PIGEON,"” I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, RIGHT? HE'S LIKE, "“THAT AIN'T NO MAN PIGEON."” I WAS LIKE, "“IT IS A MAN PIGEON."” HE TOOK A PEN, HE THREW A INK PEN AT IT, RIGHT? SOON AS HE THREW THE PEN AT IT, HIT THE OSTRICH IN THE CHEST. SOON AS HE HIT THE OSTRICH, HIS OTHER LEG CAME DOWN. HIS BODY WAS STILL FACING THIS WAY, BUT HIS HEAD, HIS HEAD WAS STILL LIKE THIS. NOW, WHEN IT-- WHEN HIS LEG CAME DOWN, THIS IS WHEN THE BITCH STARTED TO COME OUT IN ME A LITTLE BIT. I WAS LIKE, "“YOU KNOW WHAT, WE SHOULD UM, WE SHOULD, WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO GET BACK IN THE CAR BECAUSE, BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS."” YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE THAT, THAT COULD BE A SIGN. THAT COULD MEAN LIKE, "“YOU GOT 10 SECONDS TO GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE BEFORE I KILL YOU. I'M GONNA EAT YOUR KIDS."” WE DON'T, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY, SO LET'S JUST GET BACK IN THE CAR WE SAFE AT. SO WE GET BACK IN THE CAR, SOON AS WE GET IN THE CAR I START LAUGHING, I'M LIKE, "“AH-HA-HA-HA, YOU A BITCH, MAN."” LIKE, "“NO, YOU A BITCH."” "“NO, NO, YOU A BITCH."” I'M LAUGHIN', I'M DRIVING LIKE 30 MILES PER HOUR. I LOOK OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW, THE OSTRICH WAS RUNNING 30 MILES PER HOUR BESIDE THE CAR. HIS BODY WAS STILL FACING THIS WAY, BUT HIS HEAD WAS STILL LIKE THIS. AND HE WAS HAUL-ASSIN'-- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) --AT 30 MILES PER HOUR. NOW, WHEN I'M SCARED-- LIKE IF I'M REAL, REAL SCARED, I GET EMOTIONAL. I, I'LL START TO CRY IF I'M REAL, REAL SCARED. SO I GOT A LITTLE EMOTIONAL, YOU KNOW, I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND, I WAS LIKE, "“WHY WOULD YOU-- WHY WOULD YOU THROW A PEN AT IT IF, IF, IF WE, IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS?"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT SAYIN' THAT. I'M SAYIN' LIKE, I'M SAYIN', WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS."” (HYSTERICAL SCREAMING) HE'S LIKE, "“DUDE, STOP BITCHIN', SPEED UP, SPEED UP."” I LIE TO Y'ALL NOT, I STARTED DRIVING LIKE 60 MILES PER HOUR. WHEN I TELL Y'ALL THAT THIS OSTRICH WAS RUNNING 60 MILES PER HOUR, I'M NOT BULLSHITTIN'. HIS BODY WAS STILL FACING THIS WAY, BUT HIS HEAD WAS STILL LIKE THIS. HE WAS RUNNING SO-- YOU COULDN'T EVEN SEE HIS LEGS HE WAS GOING SO FUCKIN' FAST. HE WAS, HE WAS MOVING. AND THE REASON WHY I WAS SO SCARED, WAS BECAUSE HE NEVER LOOKED IN FRONT OF HIM. LIKE, HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT A WALL, ANOTHER OSTRICH, HE WAS JUST LOOKIN' AT US. BUT THE WAY HE WAS LOOKIN' AT US, IT WAS LIKE HE WAS SAYIN', "“WHEN I CATCH Y'ALL, I'MA FUCK BOTH Y'ALL UP."” OVER A PEN. OVER A GODDAMN PEN. AND I WAS LIKE, "“WHY DON'T YOU JUST APOLOGIZE?"” YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'--LIKE? '‘CAUSE I DIDN'T THROW THE PEN, I WAS SCARED. THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I EVER SHITTED ON MYSELF IN MY LIFE. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I'VE NEVER SHITTED ON MYSELF, BUT I LET GO THAT TIME. I LET LOOSE, I REALLY DID. '‘CAUSE I HAD, I HAD TO GO, I REALLY DID. NO, I SHITTED ON MYSELF BEFORE. THIS GUY TRIED TO STICK ME UP, THIS GUY CAME AT ME WITH A GUN, "“HE'S LIKE GIVE ME YOUR MONEY, BITCH! ALL OF IT, RUN IT."” I WAS LIKE, "“COME ON, MAN, I, I HAV--AH."” HE WAS LIKE, "“WHAT'S THAT SMELL?"” I WAS LIKE, "“I SHITTED."” HE'S LIKE, "“GET YOUR ASS OUTTA HERE, AIN'T NOBODY WANT TO SMELL THAT WHILE THEY TAKIN' YOUR MONEY, MAN."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I WAS HONEST, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WOMEN DON'T RESPECT ME, '‘CAUSE I'M SO HONEST, SERIOUSLY. MY WIFE DON'T RESPECT ME, I KNOW SHE DON'T. YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR LADY RESPECT YOU, MAN? Y'ALL EVER FIGHT? NO? NEVER FIST FOUGHT-- LIKE FIST FIGHT, LIKE A GOOD ONE. NEVER? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOU'VE NEVER TRIED TO HIT HIM, EVER? NO? YOU TRIED TO HIT HIM?

I THINK IF YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP AND YOUR WOMEN HAS NEVER TRIED TO HIT YOU, SHE DON'T LOVE YOU. ANY WOMAN THAT LOVE YOU IS GONNA TRY TO HURT YOU AT SOME POINT IN TIME WHEN YOU MAKE HER MAD. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GOT A GOOD WOMAN. I DON'T MIND THAT. I DON'T LIKE HYPOCRITES. I DON'T LIKE WOMEN THAT ARE HYPOCRITES. LIKE, ANY FEMALE THAT'LL LIKE DARE A MAN TO HIT HER FOR THREE HOURS AND THEN ACT SURPRISED WHEN HE DO IT. I DON'T, I DON'T LIKE THAT. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I DON'T, I DON'T LIKE THAT-- YOU EVER SEE THAT? YOU EVER SEE A WOMAN TALK ALL THAT SHIT, AND THEN ACT LIKE SHE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CONSEQUENCES CAME FROM? "“YEAH, YEAH, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WISH YOU WOULD PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME. NO, NO, NO, NO. I WISH YOU WOULD-- NO, NO, SEE, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, SEE, YOU THINK I'M ONE OF THESE REGULAR BITCHES THAT WON'T FIGHT YOU BACK, THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I PROMISE YOU, BOO-BOO!"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) HEY, YOU EVER HAVE A GIRL SLOW DOWN ON YOU LIKE THAT? "“BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I PROMISE YOU, BOO-BOO, IT'S NOT GONNA GO DOWN THE WAY YOU THINKING. NO, DON'T BE A BITCH. DON'T BE A BITCH AND WALK AWAY. COME BACK, PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME, WATCH WHAT I DO."” (SLAPPING SOUND) (SCREAMING) "“YOU CRAZY! HELP!"” HE NOT CRAZY, HE JUST TIRED OF YOU TALKIN' SHIT FOR THREE HOURS, THAT'S ALL THAT IS. WOMEN, Y'ALL KNOW HOW TO PUSH THEM BUTTONS, MAN. Y'ALL TALENTED. WOMEN, Y'ALL GOT A DIFFERENT LEVEL. LIKE Y'ALL PRESS-- Y'ALL PUSH MEN TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ANGER. LIKE, YOU EVER GET SO MAD WHEN YOU ARGUE WITH A GIRL THAT YOU CAN'T FIND THE WORDS SO YOU GOTTA MAKE A NOISE? YOU--THE WORD IS RIGHT THERE, BUT YOU CAN'T GET IT OUT. "“BITCH, FIRST OF ALL, I'M TRYIN' TO DO-- I GOT ALL THE, AH, STUFF-- OOH! SHIT! GIRL!"” YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT NOISE CAME FROM, YOU NEVER MADE THAT NOISE EVER IN LIFE. (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) THEY MAKE YOU GET TO THOSE POINTS. YOU EVER OUTLINE A GIRL? YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? IT'S WHERE YOU PUT YOUR HANDS AROUND YOUR LADY'S FACE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT HER, YOU JUST WANT TO SHOW HER WHAT YOU COULD DO. IT'S A SCARE TACTIC. IT'S REAL FAST. "“BITCH, SAY SOMETHIN' ELSE, I SWEAR TO GOD, I--"” THAT'S ALL IT IS, IT'S REAL QUICK. "“SAY ANOTHER, I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL--"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOUR THREATS DON'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. "“I'LL PUT YOUR STOMACH IN YOUR FACE AND MAKE YOU EAT YOURSELF."” "“WHAT? WHAT'D YOU SAY? STOMACH IN YOUR FACE, MAKE YOU EAT YOURSELF?"” (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) EVERY WOMAN KNOWS HOW TO PUSH A MAN'S BUTTONS. THAT'S WHAT Y'ALL ARE GOOD AT. YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOUR MAN MAD. YOU KNOW HOW TO PISS HIM OFF. YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO MAKE HIM MAD. HE COULD ARGUE WITH ANY OTHER WOMAN IN HERE, HE NOT GONNA CARE WHAT THEY GOT TO SAY. HE BE LIKE, "“SHUT UP, BEAT IT, GET OUT MY FACE."” YOU KNOW HOW TO GET A REACTION. "“FUCK YOU, TERRENCE. FUCK YOU AND YOUR THIRD BALL!"” "“WHAT?"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“MY THIRD--DON'T TALK ABOUT MY THIRD BALL! THAT DOCTOR SAID IT'S A POSSIBLE MEDICAL CONDITION! IT COULD BE CANCER!"” HE DON'T LIKE THAT. YOU--YOU KNOW HOW TO GET THOSE REACTIONS OUTTA HIM. LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT MY WIFE DO TO MAKE ME MAD? I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SHE SING WHEN SHE GET MAD. I CAN'T STAND THAT. I CAN'T STAND THAT WHEN WOMEN GET SO EMOTIONAL THEY START SINGING WHEN THEY GET MAD. ♪ YOU AIN'T GONNA DO SHI-I-I-IT ♪ ♪ NIGGA-A-A ♪ ♪ YOU AIN'T GONNA DO SHI-I-I-IT ♪ ♪ YOU AIN'T GONNA DO SHIT ♪ ♪ YOU AIN'T GONNA DO IT ♪ ♪ YOU AIN'T GONNA DO SHIT ♪ YOU JUST GOTTA, JUST GOTTA SIT THERE WITH THE "“YOU AIN'T GONNA DO SHIT"” FACE. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THAT'S, THAT'S THE FACE THAT SAY, YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' LEFT. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THAT'S WHAT WOMEN DO. WOMEN, YOU PLAY MIND GAMES. START FORGIVING MEN FOR STUFF, AND AFTER YOU FORGIVE '‘EM, THEN FORGETTIN' THAT YOU FORGAVE '‘EM, AND TALK ABOUT THE SHIT THAT YOU ALREADY FORGAVE '‘EM FOR, AND GETTIN' MAD ABOUT IT. STOP DOIN' THAT. YOU FORGAVE HIM, FORGIVE HIM. THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN BEING A MAN THAT MESSED UP IN THE PAST, AND YOU TRYING TO CORRECT YOURSELF, BUT YOUR WOMAN KEEP BRINGING THE PAST UP. SO NOW EVERY TIME YOU TELL THE TRUTH, IT SOUND LIKE YOU LYING, AND WHEN YOU LYING, IT SOUND LIKE YOU TELLIN' THE TRUTH. I'M SAYING, IT'S AT THE POINT IN MY RELATIONSHIP WHERE I'M AFRAID FOR MY WIFE TO HEAR ME HAVE FUN. I BE TRYIN' TO SHUT FUN DOWN. LIKE, WHEN SHE NOT AROUND, AND SHE CALL ME, I GET MAD AT MY FRIENDS. "“SHUT THE FUCK UP, EVERYBODY, SHUT UP! LOOK, PUT YOUR SEATBELTS ON, BUCKLE UP, EVERY--! PUT YOUR SEATBELT ON, I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS, LOOK SAFE!"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL WE FIGURE THIS OUT. SHE'S CRAZY."” THAT'S WHAT WOMEN DO. I'MA TELL YOU HOW YOU CAN TELL A BATTERED MAN. WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL A MAN HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH EMOTIONALLY, WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM, WHENEVER YOU SPEAK TO A MAN AND HE START TALKING ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITHOUT YOU ASKING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THAT'S A BATTERED MAN. SOON AS YOU MEET HIM, "“HEY, HOW YOU DOING?"” "“MY WIFE AND I GO CAMPING EVERY WEEK."” "“WHAT?"” "“SHE LIKES CHEERIOS, TOO!"” "“WHAT ARE YOU TALK--?"” HE'S BATTERED, HE THINK THAT YOU ONE OF HER FRIENDS, AND SHE SENT YOU TO COME TALK TO HIM. HE THINK IT'S A SET UP. HE'S SO CRAZY, HE THINKIN' FIVE STEPS AHEAD OF YOU '‘CAUSE HE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WHAT. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I'M JUST BEING HONEST WITH Y'ALL, I'M TELLING Y'ALL THINGS THAT REALLY GO ON. TELL YOU SOMETHIN' ELSE, FELLAS. KNOW WHEN TO FIGHT YOUR WOMAN, AND WHEN NOT TO FIGHT YOUR WOMAN, OKAY? WHENEVER YOU IN A CAR, DON'T FIGHT YOUR WOMAN. NOT WHILE YOU DRIVE. REASON WHY, '‘CAUSE YOUR FACE IS OPEN, OKAY? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DEFENSE. I'M TELLING YOU GUYS FROM-- I'M TELLING YOU GUYS FROM, FROM MY PAST, I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT THINGS I'VE WENT THROUGH, OKAY? YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THIS IS WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT MY LADY WAS CRAZY. WE WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND SHE HIT ME. FIRST OF ALL, ANYBODY THAT HITS YOU WHEN YOU ON AN EXPRESSWAY OF ANY KIND, DON'T CARE ABOUT THEY LIFE, LET'S, LET'S GET THAT OUT, OKAY? WE ON THE HIGHWAY, WE COMING FROM AN EVENT. YOU KNOW, MY KIDS IN THE BACKSEAT, AND WE ARGUING, I'M LIKE, "“YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, YOU DON'T RESPECT ME AS A MAN, OKAY? UNTIL YOU RESPECT ME AS A MAN, WE GONNA ALWAYS HAVE PROBLEMS. THAT'S WHY WE FIGHT SO MUCH. AND I'M--HONESTLY, I'M THINKING ABOUT PUTTIN' MY HANDS ON YOU. KEEP ON, AND I'M-- I'MA SHOW YOU WHAT THAT FEEL LIKE, '‘CAUSE YOU STUPID, AND YOU ACT--"” (THUMPING SOUNDS) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) OH! OH! I-I NEVER BEEN SO AFRAID FOR MY LIFE, DUDE. SHE TRYIN' TO KILL ME. I LOOKED IN THE BACK, MY DAUGHTER WAS LIKE-- (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) DONE TURNED MY BABY AGAINST ME AND EVERYTHING. (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) YOU GOTTA KNOW. GOTTA KNOW YOUR WOMAN. FELLAS, DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE A MAN, FELLAS. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP, DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE A MAN. STOP BEING YES MEN. NO WOMAN WANTS A YES MAN. DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOUR, YOUR RELATIONSHIP BETTER BECAUSE YOU AGREE WITH YOUR WOMAN ALL THE TIME. IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOUR RELATIONSHIP BETTER. IT MAKES YOU LOOK STUPID. YOU JUST SAYING "“YES"” ALL THE GODDAMN TIME. "“HUH? YEAH."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHAT, WHAT DO YOU NEED? YEAH, I'LL GET IT, YEAH. HUH? YEAH.

THAT'S WHAT MEN ARE THERE FOR, WE ARGUE. EVEN WHEN YOU WRONG. ARGUE. I'VE BEEN CAUGHT RED-HANDED SEVERAL TIMES. ARGUE. YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU WIN EVERY SINGLE ARGUMENT? BE LOUD. THAT'S ALL YOU GOTTA DO. WOMEN CAN'T HANDLE THAT. WOMEN CAN'T HANDLE WHEN A MAN'S VOICE GETS PAST A CERTAIN LEVEL. THEY BREAK DOWN. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I BEEN CAUGHT. JUST MEAN WHAT YOU SAY. AND AFTER YOU SAY IT, WALK OUT. YOU CAN'T STICK AROUND. YOU GOTTA, YOU GOTTA-- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) IF YOU STICK AROUND YOU GIVE '‘EM A CHANCE TO COME BACK AND CONFUSE YOU. SAY YOUR POINT, GET THE FUCK OUT THE ROOM. GO! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“KEVIN, I SAW YOU! I SAW YOU, KEVIN! I SAW THE BITCH IN YOUR CAR! YOU GONNA TELL ME I DIDN'T SEE YOU? I SAW THE BITCH IN YOUR CAR!"” "“BITCH, SHUT UP! SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN! EVERY TIME I COME IN THE HOUSE YOU GOT THE MICROWAVE ON, HUH? FUCK YOU!"” WALK OUT, BAM. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) DON'T, DON'T-- YOU CAN'T GIVE HER A CHANCE. SHE JUST GONNA BE STANDIN' THERE LIKE, "“WHAT--I?"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“I THOUGHT, I THOUGHT HE LIKED IT WHEN I USED THE MICROWAVE, I JUST-- I DON'T, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM OR WHAT HE WANTS FROM ME ANYMORE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I REMEMBER ONE TIME WE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT OVER A GIRAFFE. SWEAR TO GOD, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MONEY. YOU KNOW, SHE WAS MAD AT ME, SHE WAS LIKE, "“YOU SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY. I'M TIRED OF YOU GOING OUT TO THESE CLUBS, SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY ON ALL YOUR LITTLE GIRLS, THAT MONEY NEED TO BE SPENT WITH YOUR FAMILY."” I WAS LIKE, "“SHUT UP, DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY MONEY, IT'S MY MONEY. IF I WANT TO GO BUY A GIRAFFE, I'LL GO BUY A DAMN GIRAFFE, OKAY?"” I WAS TRYING TO BE A SMARTASS, I'M BEING A SMARTASS, I'M THINKING IT'S OVER. OUT OF NOWHERE SHE WAS LIKE, "“YOU AIN'T GONNA BUY NO GIRAFFES IN THIS HOUSE."” THAT'S, THAT'S WHEN I LOST IT. "“AH, I BET I DO BUY A DAMN GIRAFFE IN THIS HOUSE. TELL ME I WON'T BUY NO DAMN GIRAFFE. I'LL GO ON RIGHT NOW, AND HAVE THAT GIRAFFE HERE TOMORROW, TEACH THAT GIRAFFE HOW TO HEADBUTT THE FUCK OUT YOU. TELL ME I WON'T GET NO GIRAFFE."” I TRIED TO GET ONE, YOU CAN'T GET '‘EM. IT'S HARD TO GET A GIRAFFE. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) IT IS. I SWEAR I WAS GONNA HAVE THAT GIRAFFE RIGHT OUTSIDE MY HOUSE, JUST WALKING. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) JUST WALK, JUST WALKING MY GIRAFFE. (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW THE MOVE THAT YOU CAN'T EVER FALL FOR? "“ALL I GOTTA DO."” YOU EVER HEAR THAT SHIT? "“ALL I GOTTA DO IS--"” I FELL FOR THAT SHIT ONE TIME, '‘CAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. "“ALL I GOTTA DO IS CRIMP MY HAIR."” WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK A CRIMP IS. "“OH, THAT'S IT?"” JUST--HE JUST STUPID, "“OH, OKAY. YEAH, ALL RIGHT--"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) DUMBASS MAN. "“YEAH, COOL, ALL RIGHT."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) BEEN IN THE BATHROOM FIVE DAMN DAYS. "“I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO CRIMP IT?"” "“THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING!"” THEN THEY FLIP IT ON YOU. YOU EVER HAVE A WOMAN FLIP IT ON YOU? "“I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WAS GONNA BE QUICK?"” "“WELL, I CAN'T DO IT IF YOU IN MY FACE! LET ME DO IT!"” "“ALL RIGHT, YEAH, ALL RIGHT, COOL. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO OUT, I'LL LET YOU CRIMP IT. SORRY."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) JUST TELLING YOU WHAT I KNOW. THIS IS FROM EXPERIENCE. BUT WOMEN, AT THE SAME TIME, YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND YOUR MAN. YOU GOTTA KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE YOUR MAN ALONE. MEN GIVE SIGNS JUST LIKE WOMEN GIVE SIGNS. IF YOUR HUSBAND, OR YOUR BOYFRIEND DRIVES A MINIVAN, LEAVE HIM ALONE. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) ANY MAN THAT DRIVES A MINIVAN, DOES NOT CARE ABOUT LIFE. HE DON'T GIVE A FUCK. HE DON'T. EVERY TIME HE SLIDE THAT LONG ASS DOOR CLOSED HE, HE IS CURSING YOU THE FUCK OUTTA HIS MIND. "“STUPID ASS BITCH GOT ME DRIVING A DRIVING A GODDAMN AMBULAN--SIT DOWN! SIT THE HELL DOWN! THOMAS, EAT ANOTHER BOOGER OFF THAT WINDSHIELD, I'LL KILL YOU. I HATE MY LIFE."” I'LL TELL YOU THE REAL SIGN, LIKE IF YOUR MAN WEARS SWEATPANTS WITH NO POCKETS, THAT'S A SIGN. ANY MAN THAT DOESN'T HAVE POCKETS DON'T CARE ABOUT LIFE. YOU EVER GO A DAY WITHOUT POCKETS? THINK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT YOUR POCKETS ARE. THAT MEANS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT CHANGE, RECEIPTS, YOUR WALLET, YOU DON'T CARE! YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? TRY TO GET A MAN THAT DON'T HAVE POCKETS TO WEAR POCKETS. WATCH HOW MAD HE GET. I TRIED TO GET MY DAD TO WEAR POCKETS ONE TIME, WE WAS GOING TO CHURCH. I WAS LIKE, "“DAD, COME ON, MAN, WE GOING TO CHURCH, PUT SOME PANTS WITH POCKETS ON."” HE'S LIKE, "“WHAT THE FUCK I NEED POCKETS FOR? SHE TOOK EVERYTHING!"” "“ALL RIGHT. HA-HA, ALL RIGHT."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“DAD, YOU CAN USE MY POCKETS, DAD. THIS NIGGA'S CRAZY, HE DONE LOST HIS GODDAMN MIND IF HE GONNA STAB ON ME ABOUT POCKETS."” HE--YEAH, THAT FAMILY REUNION LAUGH RIGHT THERE. (THROATY LAUGHTER) SOUND LIKE HE--LIKE HE GARGLING BEER RIGHT NOW. (THROATY LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THEM THUG DUDES, B, YOU EVER SEE A THUG DUDE? WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO LAUGH. (STIFLED LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“COUS', GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE NOW."” BUT HE TRYING-- (STIFLED LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) HA. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THEY JUST BE TRYING TO COVER UP THEY LAUGHS REAL QUICK. "“GO AHEAD, NIGGA, EVERYBODY COME HERE--"” (GARBLED SPEAKING) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“NOT THAT FUNNY, CUZ, NOT THAT FUNNY. TRYING TO KILL YOU, NIGGA. KILL YOU."” (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) I TALK ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I LIKE MINE THE WAY IT IS. I DO. I LIKE DRAMA, I'M ATTRACTED TO DRAMA. I THINK IF YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP DRAMA'S GOOD. I COULDN'T DEAL WITH NO HAPPY WOMAN. COULD YOU DEAL WITH HER IF SHE WAS HAPPY ALL THE TIME? EVERY TIME YOU COME HOME SHE GOT SOME HAPPY SHIT TO SAY. THINK ABOUT IT, SOON AS YOU WALK IN THE DOOR SHE JUST HAPPY. SOON AS YOU COME HOME, "“OH MY GOD, WHO'S HOME? YOU ARE, YOU ARE!"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“WOO! TICKLE, TICKLE! TICKLE, TICKLE!"” "“SIT YOUR STUPID ASS DOWN! I GOT FIRED TODAY, YOU WANT TO TICKLE SOME-GODDAMN-BODY, SIT DOWN! STUPID ASS!"” HA! AIN'T NOBODY WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT SHIT. DRAMA. TRYIN' TO STAB ME. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) EVER HAVE A WOMAN PULL A KNIFE OUT ON YOU? THAT'S SOME SEXY SHIT RIGHT THERE. "“BITCH, PUT THE-- HEY, I'M NOT PLAYING NOW, PUT THE FUCKIN' KNIFE-- YOU THINK-- HEY, DO IT AGAIN! OH! SHIT, YOU GOT ME! YEAH, THAT TIME YOU REALLY GOT THERE. WE SHOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, I DON'T, I DON'T LIKE THE WHOLE DATIN' GAME THOUGH. THAT'S WHY I ACCEPT MY SITUATION. SEE A BUNCH OF COUPLES HERE NOW, LIKE, Y'ALL JUST DATING. I DON'T LIKE DATING. YOU KNOW WHY I DON'T LIKE DATING? I TRY TO IMPRESS WOMEN TOO MUCH. THAT'S MY PROBLEM. I WENT OUT, BOUGHT THIS BIG ASS TRUCK JUST TO TRY AND IMPRESS WOMEN. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT EVERYBODY LOOKED TALL IN A TRUCK, THOUGH. AND YOU DON'T NOTICE SOMEBODY SMALL UNTIL THEY GET OUT THE TRUCK. I HAD TO FIND OUT THE HARD WAY '‘CAUSE I LIKE TO FLIRT. I'M AT THE STOPLIGHT, I SAW THIS GIRL, I WAS LIKE, "“DAMN, BABE, YOU LOOK GOOD. WHY DON'T YOU PULL OVER, LET ME TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND."” SHE WAS LIKE, "“ALL RIGHT,"” HE KIND OF CUTE. HER, HER GIRLFRIEND HIGH-FIVE. (SMACKING SOUNDS) THEY WAS HAPPY. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) SHE WAS LIKE, "“GET OUT, COME TALK TO ME."” AND I CAN'T GET OUT MY TRUCK, RIGHT? I GOTTA, I GOTTA JUMP OUT. BUT, WHEN I JUMPED OUT, I DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD LANDING, I STUMBLED A LITTLE BIT AND ALL I HEARD WAS "“OH MY GOD, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY KNEES! AND THEY JUST-- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THEY JUST PULLED-- THEY PULLED OFF. I--AIN'T THIS A BITCH, I GOT KNEES, IT WAS A BAD JUMP, '‘CAUSE WHEN I LANDED I TWISTED MY ANKLE, MY HEAD HIT THE WINDSHIELD. I WAS TRYING TO PULL MYSELF UP. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I CAN ADMIT THAT IT LOOKED A LITTLE RETARDED, BUT TO YELL OUT THAT I DON'T HAVE KNEES IS SELFISH, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? HOW DID I GET OUT THE TRUCK, I DIDN'T ROLL OUT THE BITCH, THAT'S WHY I HAD AN ATTITUDE. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I HAD ONE GIRL THAT HAD ONE OF THOSE LAUGHS THAT MAKE YOU STOP LAUGHING. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOU EVER MEET SOMEBODY LIKE THAT, WITH A LAUGH THAT'S SO BAD THAT YOU GOTTA STOP HAVING A GOOD TIME? '‘CAUSE IT WASN'T A LAUGH, IT WAS LIKE A SNICKER/SNORT. SHE DID IT AT EVERYTHING, STUFF THAT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY. LIKE, WE WAS GOING TO THE MOVIES, I'M LIKE "“YOU KNOW WHAT, BABE, IT'S A LONG LINE, I'M GONNA GO PARK THE CAR WHY DON'T YOU GO WAIT IN LINE?"” SHE WAS LIKE "“ALL RIGHT, I DON'T MIND--"” (SNORTING SOUNDS) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS AT FIRST SO I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING. I STILL HAD THE CAR ON, I WAS LIKE THE CAR SHOULDN'T SOUND LIKE THIS '‘CAUSE IT'S A NEW CAR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I JUST GOT THIS CAR, I BETTER NOT HAVE NO DAMN PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR. I WAS LIKE, "“HEY LOOK, WHEN YOU GET OUT OF LINE, GO GET SOME POPCORN WITH A LOT OF BUTTER."” SHE WAS LIKE, "“OH MY GOD, I LOVE BUTTER!"” (SNORTING SOUNDS) AND I WAS LIKE, "“OKAY, THAT WAS YOU THAT TIME, I SAW YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW I MADE EYE CONTACT, I DON'T LIKE THAT. THAT IS NASTY, '‘CAUSE IT SOUND LIKE YOU SWALLOWING SNOT OR SOMETHING." BUT, THEN IT DAWNED ON ME WHERE SHE GOT IT FROM. '‘CAUSE I MET HER DAD EARLIER THAT DAY. HER DAD HAD ONE OF THOSE LAUGHS, I CALL IT THE RICH WHITE GUY LAUGH. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? IT'S A LAUGH THAT'S FOLLOWED BY AN AWFUL JOKE. THE JOKE DOESN'T MAKE YOU LAUGH, BUT THE LAUGH EVENTUALLY MAKES YOU LAUGH. HE FOUND OUT I WAS A COMEDIAN, HE KEPT TRYING TO TELL ME JOKES. HE'S LIKE, "“OH, SO AH, SO YOU'RE A COMIC, RIGHT? OKAY. UM--"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“AH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I GOT A UM, I GOT A JOKE FOR YOU. YOU CAN, YOU CAN KEEP IT IF YOU WANT, I DON'T MIND. UM, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, YOU READY? ALL RIGHT, OKAY, HA-HA. ALL RIGHT, THIS IS CRAZY IT'S SO GOOD. ALL RIGHT, SO I'M AT, I'M AT THE OFFICE. I'M AT THE OFFICE, I TELL THIS GUY, I SAID TO HIM, WHAT DID I-- WAIT, WHAT DID I SAY? WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT. I GOT IT, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. SO I'M AT THE OFFICE, RIGHT? SO I'M AT THE OFFICE, AND AH, I TELL THIS GUY, I SAID TO HIM, I SAID, '‘HEY, AH, PASS ME THE STAPLER, BUT WHEN YOU PASS IT, MAKE SURE STAPLES ARE IN IT, BECAUSE IF IT ISN'T, I CAN'T STAPLE ANYTHING.'"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) AHH! I DIDN'T WANT TO LAUGH, BUT HE KEPT LOOKING RIGHT AT ME WHILE HE WAS TALKING. AHHH! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) HERE'S THE WEIRD THING. LIKE, YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE CLAP WHEN THEY LAUGH? THEY BE LIKE, AHH-- (CLAPS) HE HAD A CLAP THAT HE WOULD DO WITH HIS LAUGH, BUT I NEVER KNEW WHEN IT WAS COMING. I COULDN'T TIME IT. LIKE YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES YOU CAN TIME A CLAP? I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN THE CLAP WAS COMING, SO IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO PARTICIPATE AND CLAP WITH HIM, '‘CAUSE IT TOOK TOO LONG, RIGHT? BUT HE WAS STILL LOOKIN' AT ME THE WHOLE TIME. HE WAS LIKE--AHHH! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (CLAPS) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THAT WAS LIKE 57 SECONDS RIGHT THERE, I CAN'T WAIT 57 SECONDS. LONG TIME AGO. I HAD THIS ONE TALL GIRL. I DIDN'T CARE THAT SHE WAS TALL. SHE WAS TALL AS SHIT, SHE WAS A MODEL. I DIDN'T EVEN CARE '‘CAUSE SHE MADE ME LAUGH. YOU MAKE ME LAUGH, THAT'S A BONUS. '‘CAUSE IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH. SO IF YOU MAKE ME LAUGH, IT'S A TURN-ON. ONE DAY, SHE TRIED TO MESS WITH ME MENTALLY. WE IN THE SUPERMARKET, RIGHT? I'M GOING TO GET SOME MILK. NOW, NORMALLY THEY PUT MY MILK ON THE MIDDLE ROW IN THE AISLE. FOR SOME REASON THIS DAY IT WAS ON THE TOP ROW. AND LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CAN'T REACH SOMETHING HOW YOU START STRETCHING FOR IT? LIKE, AHH-- '‘CAUSE I COULDN'T GET IT, I WAS LIKE--AHH! SHE'S LIKE, "“BABE, DON'T STRETCH YOURSELF, LET ME GRAB IT FOR YOU."” AND I TURNED AROUND, THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN THE AISLE LOOKIN' AT HER ABOUT TO GRAB MY MILK. SO I GOT MAD, I PUNCHED HER IN THE RIB. I WAS LIKE, "“BITCH, DON'T BE TRYIN' TO PLAY ME IN FRONT OF THEM PEOPLE. SHE'S LIKE, "“I AIN'T TRYIN' TO PLAY YOU."” I WAS LIKE, "“YOU ARE TRYING TO PLAY ME. IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME, PICK ME UP AND LET ME GRAB IT. THAT'S HOW YOU HELP."” SHE'S LIKE, "“ALL RIGHT."” '‘CAUSE I'M A THUG, I'M A THUG FIRST. (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) ARE YOU GUYS DOUBLE-DATIN'? IT'S LIKE A DOUBLE DATE RIGHT HERE. KINDA? THAT'S GOOD. I WOULD SAY DON'T DO IT NO MORE, THOUGH. DON'T EVER DOUBLE DATE. YOU KNOW WHY YOU SHOULDN'T DOUBLE DATE? BECAUSE YOU COMPETE WITH THE OTHER COUPLE. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE COMPETING. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU COMPETE. SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW, IF I'M WRONG, TELL ME I'M WRONG, OKAY? LET'S SAY YOU LEAN OVER, YOU GIVE YOUR GIRL A KISS. REAL INNOCENT--MUAH-- "“LOVE YOU, BABE."” FIRST THING SHE GONNA DO IS LOOK AT HIM, SHE'LL BE LIKE, "“MM, MUST BE NICE."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) NOW, YOU'RE COMPETING. NOW, NOW THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN WIN IS TO SUCK HER TITTY RIGHT HERE. YOU GOTTA DO IT. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY. YOU GOTTA PULL THE TITTY OUT RIGHT NOW. (SUCKING SOUNDS) THAT'S IT. BUT WOMEN, Y'ALL DISCUSS PERSONAL BUSINESS. AND THAT PERSONAL STUFF COME OUT. IT COME OUT LIKE WHEN Y'ALL, WHEN Y'ALL ARGUING, Y'ALL ALL AT DINNER ONE NIGHT. AND YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME, THEN ONE DAY YOU GET MAD. YOU LIKE, "“YOU KNOW, MICHELLE, I HATE YOU, MICHELLE, YOU COME OUT ALL THE TIME, YOU GET DRUNK, YOU MESS UP THE WHOLE NIGHT."” YOU BE LIKE, "“WHATEVER, FUCK YOU, TARIQUE, AT LEAST I DON'T EAT ASS!"” YOU BE LIKE, "“WHAT? WHAT YOU--WHAT YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?"” "“OH, YOU DON'T EAT ASS? ERICA, HE DON'T EAT ASS!"” NOW, NOW, YOU GOTTA PUT HER ON THE SPOT. "“YOU TOLD '‘EM I EAT ASS?"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“EVERYBODY WAS TALKING, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD COME OUT LIKE THIS."” NOW YOU GOTTA SIT THERE WITH THE "“YOU ATE ASS"” FACE, YOU JUST-- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) THAT'S, THAT'S THE "“YOU JUST ATE ASS"” FACE. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) CONVERSATION BEEN OVER, BUT YOU STILL MAD. "“FIRST OF ALL, ONLY TIME I ATE YOUR ASS WAS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY, LET'S GET THAT OUT THE WAY. NO, NO, NO, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY? I DIDN'T GET YOU SHIT, YOU SAY EAT YOUR ASS, I WAS LIKE, '‘COOL,' SO I ATE YOUR ASS. DON'T MAKE IT SEEM LIKE I'M OUT HERE JUST EATING YOUR ASS EVERY DAY. EVERYBODY SITTIN' HERE PUSHIN' MY DRINK TO THE SIDE LIKE I GOT THE SHIT MOUTH. FUCK Y'ALL, MAN. BET--I BET THERE WON'T BE NO MORE ASS-EATIN' UP IN HERE. I BET THAT. I BET--BET--"” HA-HA! BET THAT'S YOUR LAST ASS-EATING INCIDENT--HA! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) HA-HA-HA. NOTHING FUNNIER THAN PEOPLE'S PERSONAL PROBLEMS COMING OUT IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE. THAT'S THE FUNNIEST THING EVER TO ME, WHEN PEOPLE'S PERSONAL PROBLEMS GET BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE. '‘CAUSE YOU ALWAYS GOTTA ACT LIKE YOU AIN'T HEAR IT. YOU EVER HEAR A COUPLE ARGUE? LIKE, YOU HEAR SOME WEIRD SHIT. YOU EVER HEARD LIKE, SOME WEIRD SHIT? "“WHATEVER, BITCH, YOU THE ONE WITH ALL THE DILDOS ALL UP THERE IN THE HOUSE!"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOU BE AT THE DINNER TABLE LIKE-- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOU TRY TO WHISPER TO YOUR LADY-- "“SHE GOT DILDOS IN THE HOUSE?"” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) "“THIS BITCH IS CRAZY, SHE GOT DILDOS ALL UP IN THE HOUSE."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I THINK THAT'S THE FUNNIEST STUFF IN THE WORLD, MAN. OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS, THERE'S NOTHING FUNNIER THAN OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS. OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS-- I REMEMBER ME AND MY BOY GOT INTO IT ONE DAY, '‘CAUSE I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T THINK HIS BABY WAS WHERE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MENTALLY. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM. I DID, I TOLD HIM THAT. I SAID, "“I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE A DUMB BABY."” THERE'S A CHANCE THAT YOUR BABY MIGHT BE DUMB. YOU KNOW, BUT I FELT LIKE, ME, AS YOUR FRIEND, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? LIKE, I'M YOUR FRIEND, SO MY CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM SHOULD BE GOOD CRITICISM TO YOU. BUT HE GOT MAD, HE'S LIKE, "“WHATEVER, MY BABY'S SMARTER THAN YOURS."” I WAS LIKE, "“BET MONEY,"” HE WAS LIKE, "“BET?"” I WAS LIKE, "“WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?"” HE WAS LIKE, "“LET'S SIT '‘EM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR, AND SEE WHICH BABY CAN HOLD THEIR HEAD UP THE LONGEST."” AND I WAS LIKE, "“OH SHIT."” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) YOU KNOW, MY BABY GOT A PROBLEM, RIGHT? BUT I CAN'T BACK DOWN, I WAS LIKE, "“BET, BITCH!"” SO WE, WE PUT OUR BABIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR, AND THEY WAS GOING AT IT. MY SON-- MY SON WAS LIKE-- (MUMBLING SOUNDS) AND HIS BABY WAS LOOKING AT MY SON SO HIS BABY GOT DIZZY AND FELL. I WAS LIKE, "“LOOK AT THAT.
