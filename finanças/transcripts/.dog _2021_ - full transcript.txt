How long have you been working here? About six months. Six months eh? You've got keys? Yes. They're really nice to me Mr. Kyriakos and his wife, Mrs. Ioulia. They trust me. They've known me for a while. Great, great. Now listen... I've decided to throw you a birthday party tonight. -Okay, cool. -Awesome? Thanks a lot. -Bye. -Bye. -Happy birthday, Dimitri. -Thanks a lot, Mr. Kyriakos. Ioulia has your present. Besides the dinner she's making for you, of course. I can't make it tonight, Mr. Kyriakos. You can't? Why not? I'm busy. I'm sorry. Please tell her I'm sorry. I honestly can't make it. No. You'll have to tell her so yourself. DEAR DIMITRI, MAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE. LOVE, KYRIAKOS AND IOULIA. Happy birthday, my boy. -To your health, Dimitri. -Thank you. Kyriakos says you're going really well at the garage. You know we're very proud of you? Let the boy leave. He wants to go and see his friends. And what about the thing that's in his room? Cool! Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you... Happy birthday, Dimitri, happy birthday to you! -Happy birthday, Dimitri! -Thank you very much. And thank you for the phone. Both our phone numbers are in it. -Is the taste okay? -Yes, it's very good. -Did you give it some thought? -Ioulia, not now. If you'd like to stay here more often, I mean. It would make us really happy, Dimitri. We can talk about it with Skevi... No! I mean, because I'm still thinking about it... But today was really nice. Thank you so much. You're very welcome, my boy. Have a nice evening. Wait! Come on! Dimitri! What the hell are you doing? -It's hungry. -It's hungry? My meat? My dogs' meat? -But it's starving. -So? -It's not my dog. -But can't we keep it? Keep it? I've got my own dogs, man. You can rent it out, can't you? Are you kidding me? Rent out that thing? -Step aside, please. -Wait, wait! You want to do it? Here you go. Quit looking at me. Get it over with. Just look at it. Put it out of its misery. It's going to die anyway. I don't want to do it. Do you want to talk? I'm fine. Happy birthday, bro. -What's this, man? -Open it. A prezzy? -D'you like it? -It's the best. Does it look good on me? Thanks, buddy. Family, D. I'd do anything for my family, man. Me too. Will you sleep here? No. Tired? No. Tell me, have you ever been to the other side? What other side? The Turkish occupied side, man. No. Okay then, partner. So today we'll do something new together. Aren't you driving me to work? What did I just say? We're on our way there. Your old man needs help. It'll be an adventure. You'll see. Tomorrow you'll be back at work. I've never missed a single day. Who'll open the garage? I'm sure they can get by without you. -Don't you have a new phone? -Yeah. So then call in sick. It's simple. C'mon, kid, stop stressing. You're driving me crazy. We'll have a blast. Today you'll be my apprentice. So they bought you this amazing new gizmo, eh? Lucky you. I think he wants to be your dad. -Does he have kids? -No. Hands up you fucker! How are you? That's my son. Fatso's one of ours. Hey! What have we here? -What's up, man? -Just look at you! Son of a bitch! -How's it going? -Good, good. -Guys, this is my son, Dimitris. -Hello. Isn't he a bit old to be your son, barber? -Your brother perhaps. -He's all mine. -So... -Why do they call you "barber"? Prison talk. So guys, Dimitris wants to learn the job. He's my apprentice. As soon he learns how it works, I'll be able to trust him to do anything, right? Cool. Can your son keep a secret? Of course he can. He's my son. The apple sometimes falls far from the tree. How do you know for sure? Did he take the test? -Do you trust me? -You, I trust. So then trust my son. He has to pass the test anyway, barber. What test? You'll have to trust me. Try not to cut me. If you cut me, we fail the test. I've never shaved anyone. Don't you shave? -A little. -It's the exact same thing. After the lather, hold the blade tightly and you work it upwards, upwards. If they see blood, we lose. Okay? Look at me. Your father was the best barber in the slammer. The new inmates shave the older ones. That's how we build trust. You cut him? You're cut out. There's nothing on it. Here! Here! One move! One fucking move and you're dead. That's the real reason they called me "barber". That's my son, man! My son! Mine, mine! My man! Look! Nothing. I can't believe it didn't bleed. Nobody gets it on the first try. Little bastard! Get out of here! Bye, fatso. D'you know anything about driving? Yes, I've tried at the garage. But an automatic not a manual. An automatic! Okay, so look, it's simple. Gas, brake, clutch. Okay? Get moving and we'll see. Come on, start. Let's go. Step on it, step on it. Step on it, put it in second, second. You're moving, you're moving, you're moving! That's the way. When I was with the Hellenic Force in Cyprus... I crossed over into the Turkish occupied side and nobody saw me. Long before they opened the Road Blocks. It was dangerous back then. But I didn't care about anything. I needed to see what was on the other side. Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing, man? It's not a problem. But I don't want to risk it. Will you help me? Of course. I just don't want you to get into trouble. Relax, man. Relax, it's okay. Take this. Look! Have you ever seen more? It's a good deal, isn't it? Smell them. Touch them, go ahead. Cool? Look! Watch me. Mine. Ours. -What's this money? -I'm a courier. -Really? -Yes. They owe money, I deliver it. Open it. Come on. Close it now. Open the other one. C'mon, c'mon. Okay, hold it. Look at me: safety above all. Above all. -You trust me? -Of course. Good. Drop your pants. I adore Cypriot nature. Are you proud of our country? -What country? -This one. C'mon, hold on to it. Hold it. THE VILLAGE OF PYLA - UN BUFFER ZONE UN PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN CYPRUS NATIONALIST ASSOCIATION OF PYLA THE "MACEDONIA" Hey, hey, hey. Don't pee your pants now.

What's wrong now? What's wrong? Are you mad? -Huh? Are you mad? -C'mon! That was nothing, man. C'mon partner! Get used to life outside your protected guest house. Stop that! Stop!

Drink with us. Hi, Dimi. Hi. It's Dimitris. - Isn't it the same? - No. C'mon, c'mon, man. Relax, relax. What do you do? -Are you in school? -My son is an auto mechanic. He's very smart. He's so good, his boss has given him the keys to the garage. He's going places. D'you see my son? D'you see my son? One day he may even become a barber! Look at him! Wait, wait, wait! Stay! Dimitri, listen... Today, I have a surprise for you. A real birthday present. Go on, Andri. Show him his present. She's all yours, my boy. -Don't be afraid. -All yours. Don't be afraid. Touch them. They really like it. Grab them. Kiss her. Dimitri! Dimitri! Come now! Come on! Come on, man! Listen to me! She wants it! Dimitri! Baby! Why are you upsetting my dogs? -What's wrong? -Sit down, Dex. Sit down! Where are you? Another fucking bastard. Where do they come from? Foti. Foti, what are you doing? Don't shoot! -Leave it alone, it's a stray. -Wait, wait, wait! C'mon, get rid of it. You can't just shoot it, it's a dog, God damn it! Andri, God damn it! You'll listen to me. Get it over with. -Shoot the fucking dog now! -Okay. But let me kill it somewhere far away from here. -Far away where? -Somewhere Andri won't see it. Where I can bury it. Okay, get done with it. No crap, okay? Andri! Andri, I'm talking to you! Dimitri! Dimitri. I want to apologize for yesterday, man. Dimitri. What do you want? A buddy of mine died, man. Can you please help me? Haven't you done it before? Shave a dead man? No. Dimitri, c'mon. Wipe him clean. We used to come here. With your mother. You're the only memory I have of her. We were together since then. Since the army. You have her eyes. Did you know that? Really? I don't remember her. You must always remember to help. That's what she told me. As soon as you get out, bring him to live with you. Why didn't you let me see you all these years? To see what, Dimitri? What would change if you saw me inside? I needed you. Damn it, son. Fuck it all. Can't you listen to me once? One fucking time? We're together now. Now is what matters. Can't we just help each other? Is it so hard? Well? Is it? Come and sit with us, Mr. Alavane. How are things here, Dimitri? -Are you adapting well? -Yes, yes, thank you very much. This is my first meeting with the both of you. It's the first of several regular visits before the hearing in two months' time. So I can evaluate how things are going. Things are going well. I mean, it's still the first days, but... we're doing very well. We already went on a day trip. To the mountains. We ate. We had some nice fish at a fish taverna. It's really nice. We're son and father, a reunion. Right? And the party? I threw him a birthday party. We had a very nice time. -Didn't we? -Yes, we had a nice time. And yesterday was really nice. -What do you eat? -Nothing. Everything. Lentils. Souvlakia. Whatever Dimitri wants. Whatever Dimitri wants. -We have pizza. -I see. How's your apprenticeship at the garage? It's going very well. I'm learning a lot. Mr. Kyriakos and Mrs. Ioulia are very good to me. Of course I'm glad to finally be with my father. All right. Look. To be honest, this doesn't look like a house. You haven't followed my recommendations. I must be able to tell my supervisor... that the boy is well and living in a healthy environment. So, I'll be back next week and I want to see a difference. Okay? Dimitri, can you walk out with me, please? Alone. I'll see you soon, Mr. Alavane. Where are you? Come here. What is it, my love? I was worried about you. Look what I brought you. Come, come, look here. Some sausages. Come here. How pretty! Wait, wait. What are we going to call you? Eh? Shall we call you Alice? D'you like it? Is that the stray? -Have you given her a name? -Yes. Alice. Hi, Alice. Dimitri! Fuck. Hold her for a sec, man. Okay, dudes, see ya. Later, bro. D. is everything good? What's that over there? What? It's with the guys. What are we doing here? Huh? Have you got the keys? I need something. Like what? There's been a fuck up and I need the diagnostic computer. For the Mercedes. -D'you mean to rent it? -To rent it? Nice one. No, I don't want to rent it. I want to borrow it. -That's not possible. -Why not? -When will you bring it back? -Tomorrow. You'll bring it along to work, man. I only need it for tonight, I promise. Dimitri. Come on, son, come on, son. You're going to analyze this too? Seriously? You have to be quick. Like this. Look at me. You need to be decisive and careful. Look at me. It's the only way to survive. Dimi. Go on. Go on. You're outta here. C'mon, c'mon. Go, go, go! Move it. Move it. -See? That wasn't hard, was it? -Yes. Tomorrow morning. -Did I promise? -Yes, let's go now. -You're one cool dude for this. -Yes, shall we go? D'you hear me? Back. Back. Sit. It's been days since you came by the house. Ioulia will be very pleased to see you. Have you seen the diagnostic computer? What? No. I've asked everyone. I can't find it anywhere. Hey Fatso, not much to say now, eh? What? Look who's here! Welcome. What are you doing here? Why don't you say hello? He's pretending to be a ghost. Sit down. I'm sorry, I don't want to interrupt. -Can I talk to you? -Go ahead. Did you come for another shave? -C'mon, sit down. -Outside. -What? -Outside. Outside? Now? Have you fucking lost it? You come inside, you see my cards and the money on the table... and you tell me to come outside now? What for? What do you want? What do you have to tell me now? Why aren't you home? -Where are the tools? -The what? The tools! The diagnostic computer. Where is it? What does that have to do with anything? Okay. Do you trust me? Speak up! Say yes or no. -Do you trust me? -Of course I trust you. Okay, so my friend fucked me over. I trusted him and he fucked me over. I'm going after him. I'm not going to let it go. D'you hear me? We're getting it back. Kyriakos keeps asking me. -Did you tell him anything? -No, I didn't tell him anything. Cool. Not a word. Here. -Here you are. -I'm okay. Dimitri, please. Let me be a good dad. Please. Okay? Listen, kiddo. Tomorrow we'll do something nice together. I promise. Okay? Have yourself some fun, all right? Thanks for letting me invite Nick. Bullocks, man! Come on, man! Is she the one you'd make purr but you couldn't get it up? Shut up, butterfly boy. So, what have we here? What, you're fishing without bait? -We don't have any bait. -Well now it's here. So then. Come on, little guy. Come on, little guy. You put it through, all along the length of the hook. -Get it? -Yeah. Watch me. I'm not going to do it every time. It's in. It's in. Here you go. Here you go. You're all set. Take it. Take it. Give me that. It's simple. It's even simpler than driving. Swing it. Swing it. I'll give it some space. Swing it and throw it hard. That's my boy. Dimitri. Watch and see how real men dive. You fucker! Did you see me? I'm the king of the sea! He's the king of wankers. Dimitri! Come on! Don't be a pussy. Jump in! Come on! Jump in, my son! What are you waiting for? He'll stay with me. I can't swim. You can't swim? Here, chickie, chickie. Dimitris is a great swimmer. Aren't you, D.? I taught him. I taught him. When he was a baby, I threw him into the water. He learned how to float early on. -I'll sit and keep Nick company. -Really? As you wish. Like I give a flying fuck. My little mermaid! Little mermaid! Come over here, you bitch. Little mermaid! Do we just leave him like that? Don't you worry. It's fine. I still... owe you a birthday present. I just had sex. D'you hear me? You know what would be perfect now? Pizza! Want some? You're late. I was waiting for my ride. Who was that? It's my father. He's out of prison? Dimitri, why didn't you tell us? You're a really good kid. Look after yourself, d'you hear? -Come home. Soon. -Yes, I will. -Fotis still hasn't brought it back. -Hasn't brought what back? The equipment. Aren't you listening? Wait up, man! Wait up! You have to come back to the guest house. That's your home. What the hell? That place isn't a home. Yeah man, that place is a home. You used to call it your home once. D., come back while you can! I can see what's coming. -You're supposed to be my friend. -I am your friend and your family. Then find me a way out! Yeah, that's right! Go back to your daddy! Like I care! What an asshole, he broke my bike. Dimitri. C'mon, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's time you showed me your loyalty. Let me sleep. I've got to go to work in the morning. -Sleep is for losers. C'mon. -And what are you? What was that? Nothing. I'm kidding. This is our life. This is our world. This is how we survive. D'you think you have another choice? Huh? Huh? Don't pretend to be someone you're not. You are me. Are you kidding me? -Open up, quickly. -I don't have them. I told you. -What? -I don't have the keys. -Of course you do. -I don't. C'mon, search your pockets. Empty your pockets. Quickly! Are you serious? Are you fucking serious? I need it, damn it! I need it! Don't you want to help me? Don't you want to help us? -Aren't you my son? -Cool it, you're hurting me. What? I'm hurting you? I hurt you just now? I hurt you. God damn it! -Can I ask you a question? -Of course. It's about living here more permanently. Yes, tell me, what? It's just that I'm thinking about it. I'm glad. D'you want us to tell Kyriakos? Fuck them! Fuck them, man. I don't want them either. They can go fuck themselves. Hold it higher. Where's Nick, man? Tell me, man, where's Nick? He left, man. He didn't tell you? Fuck! Have a seat. My keys please, Dimitri. -Can I have my keys back? -Yes. I'm very sorry, but you'll have to go. Me leave? Why? My mechanics have worked for me for years. Nothing ever went missing. Not ever. Now it's been twice within a few days. Do you have something to say? This saddens me deeply. And it will sadden Ioulia. I won't tell Skevi. I'll find an excuse. Alice! Look what I brought you. Alice? No, damn it! Wake up! Don't move! Don't you dare move! -Why did you do it? -What did I do, Dimitri? Stop your lying, just stop it! C'mon, put the gun down and give it to me. C'mon. You're supposed to be my father. I am your father. I am. Why did you kill the only thing I loved so much? Me? You're being paranoid, Dimitri, don't you think? Fuck you! Fuck you! You're not my father anymore. I wanted you to be but you can't. Just look at you! Dimitri, please, give it to me. You'll pay for what you did to me. Truly you'll pay. -You can't do it. -Oh yeah? Oh yeah? C'mon. Try me. C'mon. Stay away from me. Just stay away from me. Fuck you, man! -Out! Out! Out! -Fuck you! Dimitri! Dimitri! Come back! I'm your father! Shall we go on vacation, man? -What vacation, man? -Well, somewhere. Shall we go? Faster! -Man, there's no tennis court. -What? There's no tennis court.
