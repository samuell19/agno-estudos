Call me back. I finally got a date with that boy. The one with the huge lump in his pants. Unbelievable. I want to borrow your red dress, even though my tits aren't that big. Call me right back, okay? Valerie? You got that job. Valerie? You got that job. You're leaving for Paris tomorrow, for the cover of Cosmopolitan. I told them you were beautiful are tanned, so do your best. Are you in a hurry? You look good. This isn't fun, Tommy. - Just one question. What's this zipper for? Use your imagination. Tonight, Rhonda? - No, Jimmy. Tomorrow night then? - Not now, not tomorrow, not ever. How many times do I have to say it? Good afternoon. - I came as soon as I could. To my office. What is it this time? - Sorry I'm late, okay? No, not okay. I'm wasting my time because I'm to teach in your place. You're not coming until class is over? I don't think so. I'm really sorry, Rhonda. You can't do this anymore, Jaimy. This is important to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it won't happen again. I had a bad day. Will you shut up already? All right. Then we'll go out to dinner. - Just hurry up. You'll melt. - I'm a good thinker here. You think a lot. Meet me later at 9:00? I'll be there. Do you want to know what this zipper serves? Come to the club at ten. - I'll be there. If you're lucky. - I'm always lucky. I'll see you later. Cathy? Is that you? Who's there? What the hell are you doing? Nothing. Don't even think about it. I don't want to know. Hurry up so we can eat. Go ahead, Inspector. What do you know about Rachael McClee? We've had that for the past few hours already explained to that cop. I'm not just any cop. Inspector Morgan, I'm leading this investigation. We'll see each other often. If necessary, we go for a few more hours. She was so pretty. Not anymore. Did you know her well? Not really. She came here twice a week and we greeted each other. Ever seen this before? Is that what killed her? - Maybe she was. Tell me about Diane Matthews. - What's that for? That was in her locker. So was the body, by the way. Tell me about her. She's already here for over a year. A quiet type. Never had a problem with that. I need more information. - She's pretty much on her own. A little jealous, I guess. Jealous? I'm not sure. She didn't feel so at home here. I see her in the pub sometimes. She's always alone. Like she's watching us. This is gonna be in all the papers tomorrow? Does that bother you? - Bad for business. The case? - I'm a partner. Bring the other party but informed. I'll get back to you. - I can hardly wait. No kidding? - Yeah, it happened here yesterday. Really? Somebody chopped her up and put her in a locker. Fucked first? I don't know. I had Well done, one of those pieces. I'm gonna take a shower, otherwise I'm gonna be late for work. I didn't train hard. - See you later, then. Debbie, you take over for me. What are you doing? Business is bad enough as it is. Do your job and don't stand with shaking your tits and ass. And who are you? I'm Chuck Dawson. I was just... Who are you? - Rhonda Johnson, the owner. Can you find it? - You don't understand. There was no one and I wanted take a look around here. Look around? Try Hollywood and get the hell out of here. Funny, but it's different. I'm starting to work here today. It's out of the question. - This is a very bad start. Your associate, Mr Erickson, hired me yesterday. Is it getting clearer now? Very clear. Where do I start? I'm eager. The men's toilet can be polished. Exactly. What's your problem? I don't have any problems. Are you new here? Since today. Who are you? - I'll give you some good advice. I'm listening. Don't touch Rhonda. - Get out of here. Can't you hear me? Get your hands off her! or I'll tear you down. Piece by piece. You're going into the fog. Next time I'll kill you. That was awesome. Did you see that? - I saw enough. Do we know each other? - I'm Debbie. Fancy a ride? - Today's best offer. Get in. Have you been working out long? - A little over a year. What do you know about Jimmy Hallik? - I've been with him for a while. Why is that? - That guy's weird. He ties up girls and stuff. A little kinky is fine, but he's just weird. Do you have his address? - Do you want to go out with him? No, maybe I'll go stop by his place. I'm gonna go find it. I have to change anyway. Stay here. I'll be right back. Mr Erickson? This is Chuck Dawson. Yeah, I know. I haven't gotten that far yet. That's what I'm paid for, yeah. Don't worry. I have to go. Jimmy's address. - Great, and thank you. Are you leaving already? - I'd better be. I've got a lot of work to do. You've got some work here, too. - Oh, yeah? Hello, Jimmy. - Diane. What are you doing tonight? - I don't know. What about you? No plans yet. - Too bad. Morgan to headquarters. Is that report on that needle there yet? Doesn't matter where I am. I want that report in half an hour, ...or I'll perform a section on his face. Let's get to work. It's Diane Matthews. Are there any groceries for me? None at all? Thank you. Thank you. Who's there? Who's there? Open the door! Open the door! Open the door. Open up, police. It's Morgan. What's up? - That needle belongs to Diane Matthews. It wasn't the murder weapon. - Damn it. Is anybody there? We're closing. That wasn't fun, Jimmy. Don't ever do that again. I didn't mean to scare you. - I wasn't scared. I'm not a killer, you know. - Cut it out! Cut it out! Cut it out! I just wanted to see you. You're not a killer, but a jerk. Quiet, why did she have to come? - It's her paint. The coast is clear. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Wait till they see this. - There's a car coming. Where's Curtis? - Definitely caught. We have to find him. - You're the one. I'm going back to the car. Curtis? Is that you? Curtis, where are you? See you later, Brad. I didn't do it. You've been working here since yesterday? That's right, Inspector. Coincidentally, with this murders. I'm sure it is. - Why don't I believe you? I have an honest face, don't I? - You did a good job on that kid. That was easy. - That was easy. I'll find out what you're hiding. Count on it. I didn't... - It's okay, Tommy. What's going on? - I'll show you what that zipper's for. Goodbye, Tommy. What's wrong, kid? That guy hit you hard. - Handcuffs? You were unconscious. - It all happened so fast. Do you remember when you were was lying with two bodies? Take it easy. Take it easy. I'm not done with you yet. I'll be right back. Don't do anything stupid. There's a cop at the door. See you tomorrow, Inspector. Everything seems to be going faster since you've been here. That's what it looks like. I want to talk to you. So do I. I just spoke to my associate. I wanted to beg him leave the case open, but he was already planning to. I don't get it. There must be a reason. I know, damn it. But I want to know why. - You're handy with that thing. I'm pissed and I want answers. What are you going to do about it? You're just hanging out here. While half of our members are being murdered. May I? Very sharp. - At least you're not. I'm just doing my job. What's your job, Inspector? Do you have a suspect yet? - Several, in fact. I don't know the motive yet. But you will. How reassuring. Agent Peterson is staying here tonight, if that's all right with you? Cause the body bags are running out. You okay, Rhonda? - I'm fine, Jimmy. I'm very busy. There are some problems. I know. I can help you, Rhonda. I don't think so, Jimmy. Check in every hour. - Understood, Inspector. Where is he? - I'm here asking the questions, Charlie. That's your name, isn't it? Charlie Dawson, private investigator. You looked familiar. The case Simpson, about six years ago? More like seven years ago. - What's going on here? Are you telling me if You want the handcuffs? He'll run away. - We'll get him. But now I want to hear the truth. Me too, by the way. It's over anyway. Her partner got me hired after the first murder. To keep an eye on everything. - Also to spy on me? I was here to save you. I saw Jimmy spying on her. Not normal anymore. I searched his locker and I found this. All yours. Rhonda at the gym and at home. Rhonda in her car. Rhonda crossing the street. He kept asking me out, but I wasn't expecting this. Did you go out with him, too? - Never. There's more. I went to his flat tonight. And whose picture hangs over there on all the walls? Mine? - Yes, it is. What kind of pictures? - Just pictures. Rhonda must have been next. That's why I'm here. Tomorrow you leave again to San Francisco, understand? You can have him, Inspector. But get him. Right now. Do you do laundry, Cathy? I'm leaving while I'm still in one piece. I can recommend it. I was just kidding. - I want to divorce Jaimy. She was just here. In the gym, maybe. Jaimy? That's illegal, Dawson. I told you to leave. - I'm going, Morgan. I came to pick up my things. - Try the key. The report on the weapon is there. Come see for yourself. I'm on my way. Inspector. - Miss Johnson. What is it this time, Inspector? Sit down, Valerie. Valerie Johnson is your real name? Not anymore. I changed my name legally. After yesterday I was convinced that Jimmy was the killer. He's crazy, but he's still no motive. Something's not right. All the murders had two things in common. All members of the gym. And the other thing I just found out. They were all beautiful people. With a perfect, cool body. Except me. - Except you, Rhonda Johnson. You were the handsome Valerie Johnson up to 70% of her body burned five years ago. Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! - Valerie was a top model-to-be, until they're not even in a circus was allowed to perform. What do you want, Morgan? Do you want to see this? You don't have to. Now you know my secret. So what if I do? That's why I'm not a killer yet. - I think you are. It makes you crazy to have all those to see beautiful bodies, while you have your own body has to hide. You know no one wants to make love to you. Son of a bitch. - I'm doing my job. You have no proof. I didn't do anything. Now what? - Dawson's dead, like the others. When? - It was Jimmy Hallik. We have the weapon. I'll have him tracked down. Are you still there, inspector? Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Halt, you're under arrest. Drop it. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! Why did you kill Chuck Dawson? You didn't kill those others. That was Rhonda, wasn't it? You're trying to cover for her. You're trying to cover her. Why? Answer me, Jimmy. Now, Jimmy. She did it, didn't she? Why did you kill Dawson? - Because I love you. You weren't supposed to get caught. This isn't a police car. - No, it's a rental car. I was just about to have lunch, until you took me with you. for supposedly urgent cases. Shut up and get out. Hear this kind of outing in your daily work? I did today. - What do you want with that shovel? Are we looking for a hidden treasure? - It's so obvious. It's taken long enough, Morgan. What are you up to? Here's perfect. All right, Inspector. What are we doing here? This land belonged to my father. He would settle here after his career as a cop. But it didn't come to that. A nozzle he was holding on to, shot him with four bullets. Thirty years of service. Over and out. So simple. Very touching. What's that got to do with me? Shut up, I'm not done yet. My father was a good man. He obeyed the law, and taught me to do the same. The difference between good and evil, isn't easy to make, he always said. One day, 25 years ago, he has that difference can't make it. There were ten murders in two weeks. They called him the Night Strangler. My father knew who it was. He picked him up. But he got out because of procedural errors. The murders started all over again. A few weeks later the man was gone. My father never told me, where I'm sure. I know what happened. - What do you mean? What I mean, Johnson, is that I'm making a difference today. You're crazy, Morgan. Crazy. Me? At least you've got twelve people murdered. And you're saying I'm crazy? I didn't kill those people. Just Jimmy in self-defense. Read the papers. - I did. I read the report and knows what the police think. Rhonda Johnson kills crazy killer in self-defense. The whole town thinks that you're a hero. I have no idea how you got it done. Maybe you were lucky that there was another lunatic running around. But I don't think so. You did it. You're wrong, Morgan. You're crazy. You can't solve the case and your ego can't handle it. I know you did. You know you did. If I let you go, it starts again. I won't let you. You're crazy. You can make me don't just kill them. You can't. Who do you think you are? God's avenger? No, I'm just a human being. Justice will be done. And now. My father will understand. Rhonda, I wasn't expecting you. I'm just gonna stop by get my spare keys. Listen to me. Two for one. Join this week. Two members, pay one. The first fifty members get a new leotard. A full page? - Sounds good. Take it straight to the paper. - I will. Next week it's teeming here from the beautiful bodies. That's what I'm counting on. Translation: Wess Lee
