(Country music) (pleasant music) I am Gloria Nation. I'm a Marine, I'm a single mom. Thomas, it's important that you take great pride every day that you leave this house. Now is that school appropriate? And I work two jobs. My bail bonds office sits in the back of my tattoo parlor. We call it Nation's Fire. So I started my club Heaven's Fire. Hey girl. [Gloria] I wanted to follow my daddy's footsteps. My daddy was CW Nation, Thomas and I call him Pop-Pop. My daddy started up the Reino de la Furia, a biker club. It's a one percenter biker club here in Florida. Never take anything less than your green for you. [Gloria] Daddy was my strength. And then it's kinda simple, all you have to do is go out there in the real world, and get it. And since he was the president of Reino de la Furia, I knew them one percenters would not mind. Hell, they didn't even mind that we had the Florida Rockers on our backs. They knew we were ride or die chicks. Yeah, it's been a good minute. How's the little man? He's doing great. Getting bigger every day. Rita, my former best friend, took over my slot as president. We've been estranged ever since Vito made me leave to raise my son and to help my daddy. I'd love to stay and chat, but I'm waiting for a meeting. Good to see you smiling again. My mama, growing up she was dealing with a whole lot of alcohol abuse. I don't know how to say it, I'm not gonna say it again, I'm done here! No, no, you're not done! You said that before! I stopped drinking for three days! Don't do this in front of this little girl! God almighty, what's the matter with you? You're so calm. I can't believe it, I love you so much. I love you too darling, Gloria! Go find someplace where you can't hear it, and if you really, really get unhappy find me, call me. - We can talk this out! - Okay darling. - I'll try and get it... - I'm sorry about this. Don't listen to him, Gloria. Don't listen to him! - I don't care... - I chose you, bitch, and now I'm done with you. Oh you're gonna throw us all away? [CW] Oh shut up. You don't throw a glass away when it's broken. You don't throw a marriage away! You don't throw a relationship away! [Gloria] I was sent to a boarding school up in Tallahassee. It was there that my childhood dream of being a Marine became a reality. Really, a Marine? - Yep. - Semper fi. Get over here for a hug. Outstanding. [Gloria] After I got back from the Marines. He does love to rhyme. Just like his Pop-Pop. [Gloria] We had a whole 'nother battle to face. [CW] That's true. [Gloria] My daddy had cancer. His daddy is an asshole. This is Thomas. My world, my heart. Why did he have to leave? No he didn't leave us. He's always here. Pop-Pop was just needed. It was Daddy who helped raise Thomas after I was deployed overseas. He loved you so much. Thomas, let's go trying to make sure he ain't nothing like his daddy. Not if I could help it. Thomas! He was all his Pop-Pop. (Rock music) You have patience like a saint. Hey Saturday, can you come early? I can go on before Nasty Savage. [Man] Hey Freddy, fire up that... There she goes, folks! Running away! As usual. No wonder you went to Iraq. Iran. Well. The country that suits your little diva needs, Iran! You ran. Pew, pew, pew! Hell, we all ran. Right? Owen, can you go get me some more beer in the back fridge? We're all out in here. [Gloria] Must your grandson always see this side of you? Well let me get this straight, it's okay for Tommy to see his daddy in prison. Oops. But that isn't it. A wee bit late. I asked you to take him to school when I had something planned. And in classic Myra Johnson form, something came up. I wish for a moment you'd act like somebody's mama, or grandma rather than a washed up old lady. Old lady. Listen to me, you spoiled little bitch! I am your goddamn mother! And you will show me some respect. - I'll tell you what, Ma. - What? I'll show you the respect you deserve when you give it to yourself. Patience, like a saint. Let's go, Thomas. (Somber music) You have a great day. Come and give your mama some love, muah! I'd better not get a call from Mr. Kamaduchi about that choice of wardrobe for school. You won't, Mom, I promise. What are you doing with that old thing? I thought it was too small for your head. It is, I'm gonna give it to a friend. Hey, guys, wait up. All right, I love you Mom. Make sure you come right home after school, okay? I got something special planned for us tonight. All right. And Saturday's the bike fest fair. I want you there, little man. I thought we were gonna go see my father. Mm-mm, not this weekend. Maybe next. Okay good, 'cause I really don't like going there. Love you. - Bye Mom. - Bye. - Hi Mrs. Nation. - Hey. (Birds chirping) Hey guys, I'll catch up. There you go. And you can have this too. All right, have a good day. (Gentle music) You know, you gotta forgive her. She never really learned how to express herself. Half the time, or probably a good deal more than half the time it's the alcohol. And... I wish sometimes I could make her happier, and I don't think I'm doing the best I can, but I'll tell ya one thing, she is extremely proud of you, as am I, and she loves you very, very much, as do I. And you are gonna be something, and you know why? Because you are something already. It was a sad day for me when my husband, Vito, got locked up. At first, he was big and strong, and treated me real good. But then the truth came out, and it became my worst nightmare. Sign the fuckin' papers. On paper, Daddy owned the two businesses with Vito, my ex. It was in his will that Vito resign the business over to me. I didn't sign 'em yet. Okay, well I need you to. I need my lawyer to look at 'em. Oh for shit's sake, just sign the damn papers. You at least owe me that. You got a mouth today bitch? You know something Vito, growing up my daddy showed me the true beauty of a man. Shame on me for marrying you. You ain't nothin' but a beefed up version of my mama. I need you to sign that shop over to me before it gets lost in other club earnings. Alfonso knows that's yours. In theory, yeah. But on paper it's yours with the club. Everything that you've earned is now the club's since you ain't ever gettin' out. So if not for me, do it for your son. The income will help me with him. Talk to Alfonso in the club. They still kicking down my share, right? I don't want their money! I don't want the money that way! I want my shop's earnings. You and my daddy started that up. I just need you to sign off on the fucking papers and that's it. You having issues today? Riding the cotton pony? Look, I'm raising Thomas. Your club is what got you in here. Killing those people for the sake of a club? I need you to sign those papers, and that's it. I will continue to raise my kid. Our kid! Don't forget that. I gave you a great life when I was home. He was okay then, right? When I was active in the club. You didn't give a shit where the money came from then, just as long as your needs were taken care of. So don't talk to me about the lifestyle. You were deep in it with those dykes on bikes. Don't tell me what I should do for you. Those days are dead, bitch. You're right. I won't ask for me. Ever. But you will do it for your son. Sign the goddamn papers. Vito was the vice president of Reino de la Furia when my daddy was president. He's my son's father. I guess we all do stupid shit when we're young. It's gonna be 10 % anywhere, sir. Yep, they get that back as soon as they hit court. Okay, we're located at, hello? He just hung up on me. Totally hate that. - Rude, man. - Thank you! Can I help you? - Yeah, hi. - Hi. You know those coupons are 10 years old, right? I'm looking for Bear. And you are? An old friend. My name is Bailey Daniels. He knows me as Junior, we served together. (Rock music) So you've been out for six months, and you just come to see me now? What the hell, man? Trying to get my shit together. You know it's sad. You do numerous tours, you stick your neck out there every day, then you come back here, you can't catch a break. Right? Nobody wants you. It's like you don't belong. You're not part of a team that depends on you constantly for their safety. You're isolated out here. But, thank God I can still ink. Paid the bills while I was on the road. Well, maybe you're like me. Not cut out for the nine to five. Fuck no. Fuck it, I'm putting different music on. - Shit, you got skinny. - Fuck you. Alfonso. - Nice to finally meet you. - Same here. Bear has talked to me a lot about you. I feel like I already know you, and you know what? I like you. He's a good man. Yes. Bear told me about when he and some of his men were trapped inside that burning tank, and you ran back through the flames, not scared for your life. Only thinking about the lives of your men. You saved Bear's life. Thank you, brother. That is fucking heroic, brother. Yes! In my book, superheroes don't wear capes. They wear dog tags. Salud. - Salud. - Salud. (Bottles clink) ♪ You make it all seem great ♪ (speaks in foreign language) - Let's go to church. - Yeah, let's go to church. ♪ You were the one I turned to ♪ So Joseph sent another barrel of cash, and instructions. Who sends barrels of cash? Who cares? He pays us a lot for protection, so we gotta honor his wishes. And I quietly disposed of the Mikey situation. And lastly Vito, he sent another 10 grand, that's it. I have to go see Vito this week to handle a situation for Gloria. The man is sending money to the club weekly, but nothing to his home. Do we know what he is moving on the inside? Okay, all in favor of the capitan, the Capitan Sharktooth continuing his duties of cleaning up the tattoo parlor. - I second. - Aye. Aye. [Vince] Oh boy! You've got the gig. Super awesome. Super excited. I'm gonna go tell Gloria. What's with that guy? That's Vince, Vincey. He's very dear to the club. He is one of the originals. He took a bullet to the head to protect me. He's stuck at being a 12 year old. I couldn't do it, live life like that. Watch out when he's swinging a rolled up sock, man. Dude's a beast. When he starts smacking you with that thing, the kid is relentless. (Men chuckle) Hey, okay okay. Bailey, we want you to know we appreciate what you have done for this great country of ours, and what you have done for our brother Bear. I understand your isolation, what you're going through, but we do not want you to be alone anymore, no sir. We want you to be part of our family. I put forth a motion that the sergeant becomes a full member of El Reino de la Furia, the Nation of Fire. I second that. No warrior such as you should ever have to be a prospect, no no. You're family, full patch. All in favor? - Aye. - Aye. (Gavel bangs) (emotional music) [Alfonso] Welcome amigo, welcome. (Man chuckles) Excuse me! Whoa, you are Pete the Big Dude Jethro! I just read an article about you! What are you doing here? I'm just passing through. - I need some gas and so... - Stupid me. What else would you do at a gas station? Well actually I was lookin' to get my car washed too. Shit, you are the Big Dude. You can go in now if you like. I'll even dry your car off for you. How much do I owe you, kid? I can't believe the Big Dude is in my gas station! It's crazy. (Eerie music) Why do they make them so loud? So you can hear them coming. Excuse me sir, could you sign me an autograph please? [Big Dude] Sure. Sir, I love it when you place the butts on their head. You mean headbutts? Headbutts, yes, headbutts. Looking very frightful. Here you go. Is it all right if I take my car in now? No problem sir, no problem. You pull right up, and I will wait for you at the exit to dry you off, Mr. Big Dude. (Ominous music) (hammer thuds) (knocking) We found him. We got the child molesting son of a bitch. [Gloria] What's going on? They found a bad man they were looking for. He's very bad. Very bad. He touched children, little children. Hey Rascal, have you seen my crayons? Nope. My crayons, not yours! (Somber music) Where am I? Who are you? Alfonso. Oh, sorry. (Men chuckling) This is my brother from another mother, huh? You know, we were big fans of yours, man. I was actually at the Nassau Coliseum back in '86 when you put that hurtin' on Pipa. It was fucking amazing. It was beautiful. Who are you people? Is it money you want? You want money? I can give you money. What the hell's goin' on here? Big Dude, chill. Chill, don't get all loud and nasty. We don't like rudeness. We, we? Who the hell is we? Who is we? Say something! (Big Dude sobbing) Fee fi fo fum. I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread. You're not laughing. You don't like this? Should I fit you with some concrete shoes? You remember that quote? I think you stated in Ring Magazine when they asked you if you were affiliated with the mob, you said, "Yeah, I'm going to "buy myself some concrete shoes and," well I don't remember what you said, but I remember it was a stupid comment. Don't you know there's no such thing as mafia, just men determined to make good business. Better business. You know Pete, I once caught a rapist. Oh yeah, it's a true story. It was back in my old country, my old neighborhood. I was maybe 15. It was with my uncle, my baby brother. I was going to turn him into the authorities but I knew two of the women he raped, so I called them up. They did some nasty shit to him. Oh yeah. And then, then there was this man from Glendale, New York. Always the first one with the gadgets. He had the state of the art movie theater in his own house. Remote control cars, televisions, TV's with video games. Mr. Electronic. Families trusted him to have the kids come over and play. You know a place to hang out like a modern day candy store, but then the rumors started. The allegations came. The man was arrested, and let go. Hiding behind his celebrity, claiming people were trying to extort money from him. I remember he stated that it was very painful for him, that financially he was sacrificing so much because nobody would hire him. (Big Dude whimpering) Not as painful as being molested, huh? No. Especially if you're seven years old. [Big Dude] No, please, no. You never recovered from that. So tell me Pete, why do you people do this? I want to know. I didn't do it. (Snaps fingers) No. I didn't do anything. Do you know why you're here? No. - No, no idea? - No. No, it's all a mystery to you. (Big Dude sobbing) I forgive you. I forgive you. Let me go. It wasn't me, no it wasn't me. So do you know why you're here now? Yes. Oh you do? That seven year old was Corrina. My baby girl. Pete, that's not very good begging. Please! I'm going to tell you something. - Please! - Whatever you're afraid of right now, I promise you this is going to get much worse. I promise. And I'm going to sit right here, and I'm going to watch the whole thing. (Big Dude whimpering) (suspenseful music) Pretend it was your kid. (Big Dude screaming) Die, die! Hey love. Did you do your homework? Yep. I wish you would pay more attention to school than this game. Okay Mom, I'm trying to play. Go! Whoa. The images, they're so real. They're so much more real than the Atari 2600. What's Atari 2600? Never mind. I have meeting tomorrow, so Mr. De Gaines, he's going to drive you to school. Your mother, she has, well something else to do. I put a little spending money right over there on your books. I wanna work with you. Oh Corrina, my baby girl. We've had this conversation before. I am not a child. These are words I don't want coming out of your mouth. You've raised me since birth on this life. I paid extra attention to you. You want to learn? You think it's easy, what I do? This is not a life I want my daughter to be involved in. Too much blood money. I would prefer it if you were a doctor. I can do this. [Josip] Oh you can do this? I'm ready to do this. Oh you're ready? You're ready. Okay. Well this changes everything. Tomorrow you will get your orders. Okay? You do not get a pass because you are my daughter. You will do every test that is asked of you, you understand? - I understand. - Do you understand? Yes. Good, 'cause this is not like your video game where you can press the reset button. Once you cross that line, there is no turning back. You understand? I can do this. (Emotional music) My Corrina has gone, and a new soldier has been born. Okay, new soldier. Go pick up the money from the books and bring it to me. From now on, you earn your money. (Birds chirping) Boo. Ma, I hate when you do that. [Gloria] You about done? Yeah, I'm just finishing up this project for tomorrow's economics class. Mr. Somatis gave us all this assignment on running a funeral parlor into the ground. We had to come up with ways to place the business in the red. God, what the hell kind of assignment is that? Well, we were each handed this fictitious business. I asked for a tattoo parlor, but I was handed AJ's House of Burial. So I made AJ, who runs the funeral parlor, this alcoholic crook. He's a sad and terrible salesman, he has poor business sense, and well, he tries to stay afloat by stealing people's credit cards and overpriced caskets. Sounds like this guy just needs a rope to hang from. Mom, when I die, can you cremate me and bury my ashes near Pop-Pop? Hey, stop that talk! You're gonna outlive me. So when I die, you can cremate me and put my ashes by Pop-Pop, okay? Mom, promise me, I'm serious. Thomas! [Thomas] Promise! I promise. I promise! Now promise me you'll do the same. I wanna pinky swear. Okay. Okay. (Knocking) [Mikey] Hang on a second! [Corrina] Hey it's me, it's Corrina. You have a great day, come give your mama some love, muah. Gonna be late. I should've stayed home today. I mean, most of the teachers are away at a dorky teacher con anyway. (Suspenseful music) [Man] Hey. Here's your lunch. Hey. Who's that little girl you talk to every day? The one you gave your helmet to? Oh, she's Georgia. She's cool. I think she's homeless, but she really likes your PB&J sandwiches by the way. I'm gonna be late. Is she really homeless? I mean, ah, she's there in the mornings and then she's there when we get out and one person caught her peeping into the windows. I just don't really know. I love you. Get going. (Trunk creaks) You wanna earn respect? Sell hard. Take care. Hey Thomas! I love ya! For your protection, in case you need it. Our secret. Don't tell your dad. (Trunk creaks) Truly blows. We should just stay home today. I know, I begged my mom to let me stay home, but she forced me to be here. Thank got we have Somatis, then we get to go home. You want one? Oh god no, I tried one of those earlier. They taste like shit. Where'd you get 'em? Rich girl, Corrina. She was throwing 'em at us in gym. She's in my next class. We both have Somatis. I do too, but Somatis left this morning. He had some kind of an emergency. His sister's store got shot up or something. It's sad. Jesus! (Suspenseful music) My name is Mr. Harper. Now some of you guys know me from automotive. Mr. Somatis had an emergency, so I'm keeping my eye on class today. You guys are lucky. You get to do nothing for the next 45 minutes. (Suspenseful music) [Josip] Once you cross that line, there is no turning back. (Suspenseful music) (gunfire rattles) (somber music) (kids screaming) (gun firing) (gun fires) (sirens wail) (people screaming) (somber music) I'm Gloria Nation. (Gloria wailing) Bear, Bear! Motherfucker! What did you do? What did you do? (Gloria sobbing) (birds chirping) There you are. I was wondering where you went. Here. How are you holdin' up? Still surreal. Yeah, well it's only been what, six weeks? It'll ease soon. When CW left, do you know it took me nearly three goddamn years to deal with it? Yeah. You're gonna see and hear things every day that remind you of Tommy. Hell, I still do every day with CW. But I realize that his soul left this world. Mama? [Myra] What? I don't know if I can make it without my baby boy. [Myra] That boy always made me smile. Still does. ♪ Whenever you are sad and blue ♪ ♪ No one to tell your troubles to ♪ ♪ Remember me ♪ ♪ I'm the one who loves you ♪ You used to sing that to me when I was a baby. [Myra] Oh yes I did. That stupid song. You remember it, huh? I'm so surprised that you remember it. That's my favorite, Mama. Do you know that song always put a smile on your face? Yeah. Anytime my little girl was upset, that song always put a smile on that beautiful, beautiful face. Aww. Help me up. You know what? I wanna give you something. (Gentle guitar music) You told me you got rid of this after Pop-Pop died. I know, I know. Child, I told you many things. Sometimes it was to protect you. Look around, see everything? Pretty much everything in here was his, and now it's yours. Whatever you want. Just take it. What's the matter, baby girl? I can't do it. Please put the training wheels back on, Pop-Pop. What do you mean you can't do it? You have to try again. You can't just quit. Listen to me. Life is about courage. It takes courage to get back on the bike, but you have to try it again. You don't ever wanna quit. Yes, even the bike. Do you know he actually built that for the Day of Unity? No. He had this crazy concept. One day I would love to see every biker-- Come together. No race problem, no club problems, no arguments, no fights, no nastiness among 'em. Just forget all that, put it aside and remember the key word, biker. The only thing you'd have in common then would be the openness of the road, riding your bike with the free wind hitting you in the face. That's what it is, true bikers because what that is is whether they're guy bikers, girl bikers, whatever it is they're banding together for a common cause. Peace, love, and above all else, [Both] Unity. That was your daddy. Come here. You sounded just like him. Oh come here, you silly girl. [Gloria] Thank you. (Blues music) (knocking) Sure he's here? Yeah, yeah. [Bear] Hey Mikey, we need to chat. What's up man? [Bear] Quickly. [Mikey] Man. We only got a couple of minutes, man. He's gonna be here. You guys want a beer? You know Vito had the greatest idea with these things. You take 'em, and then you dip 'em in the product. It's a fuckin' killer concept, man. - Fuck, man! - This ain't a social visit. What the fuck did Vito get you mixed up in, man? Kids are dead because of this shit you cooked up, man. Alfonso is pissed. He's on his way here. Now, if you listen to me I can probably keep you alive. Where's your cut? It's in the bedroom, I think, why? I cut some of those with formaldehyde. [Rascal] Found it. Toss it to Tripod. Now where is the money you made from this non-club venture, Mikey? Holy shit! All that? When they walk in, you say nothing. Listen to me. Let me do all the talking, say nothing. I'll handle this. (Knocking) Open the door. Start up a business like this without clearing it with us first. Even if you were doing it with the best intentions in mind. Alfonso has the last say! You know that. Hi, Mikey. Hm, hm. Mikey, Mikey. What do we have here, Mikey? Ooh! Nice. (Alfonso sighs) How much is here? And how much in inventory? Are you listening to my questions, huh? Dale. He asked you a question. You don't understand me, right? Maybe, maybe we should rephrase the questions. Like in the DMV when they ask you the same simple questions three, four times, right? [Man] That's fine. (Alfonso laughs) What are you doing in this apartment, Mikey? What are you doing? Because it sure seems like you're running some game here. I'm not sure I heard the question right. (Alfonso sighs) You are done. (Mikey groans) Alfonso, please, I swear, I didn't mean any disrespect. I was just trying to do something on my own, and the money, the money is all yours. Take it, and the product? Take it, take everything. - I wanted to show you-- - Turn him around. Kids were killed eating this shit. (Ominous music) (Mikey groans) (gentle guitar music) (bottles clatter) (somber music) They didn't give me a parade when I came home neither. They called me baby killer. They spit on me like I was shit! I wanna give you something. Give me your hand. Thank you for your service. (Dramatic music) (somber music) Georgia, right? Hi, I'm Gloria. Thomas's mom? Yeah, I know. I thought you were the man in the Cadillac. It's late for you to be out. Your family must be worried. Do you need a ride back? No. My mom ran away with my uncle. My father dropped me off here. He said he was gonna get gas. He said he was gonna be right back. When did he leave? A while ago, I guess. Thomas used to love that helmet. Yeah, I know. And peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Yes he did. I saw it, all of it. All the way up to the man in the Cadillac. What, what did you see? Tell me, please. Please, just tell me. What did you see? I was in the tree. I watched the man in the Cadillac give the bad girl a bag. She had guns, and candy. She shot the kids in the classroom. Thomas tried to save them. He tried to stop her, but he shot the bad girl with her own gun, and the security guard shot Thomas. He must've thought that Thomas was the bad girl, but he wasn't. He tried to save them. You said you thought I was the man in the Cadillac. What did you mean by that? He comes every night. Sometimes with men on motorcycles. The day of the shooting, where was he? Right where he is now. (Ominous music) Oh, officer, thank God! Ma'am, walk away from the girl now. No, but there's a man over there-- Ma'am, step away from the girl now. - There's a man-- - This is your last warning. Step away from the little girl. We don't want you, we want the girl. Go back to the shop, Gloria. Do I know you? (Georgia screams) Move out of the way. Georgia, run! (Intense music) Give me that, now run, over there. (Knocking) I need help. You show up in the middle of the night with some off the wall story and some filthy kid? My god, woman. I get you've been through some shit, okay I get it, but we are not friends! I didn't have anywhere else to go. I can't trust anybody else! I'm just asking you to help me this one time! We are not friends. I don't know why you're here. If what Georgia saw is true, then this changes everything. My son is innocent! He was acting in self-defense! Help me on this. Rita, you gotta help me on this. Come on, Rita, she's in trouble and she's one of us. No, see that's where y'all are wrong. She left! She is the one that chose a new life. She bailed. She's the one that turned her back on her sisters. Rita, it's my son! It would clear his name. Not my problem. Those bikers had our patches on 'em. All of your patches, all of our patches on 'em. So this does pertain to you, and you! All of us! Help me out this one time. What's goin' on? She got herself into some trouble, but she's gonna go ahead and get herself out. (Knocking) See who's at the door. (Ominous music) It's a cop! All right, all right. All right, all right. You and little miss sunshine go upstairs. Come on. Everybody pay attention, be alert, watch the street. Just go get the door. [Woman] Can I help you, officer? - I'm sorry to bother ya. - Come on in. We're conducting a house to house search for a felon and a child believed to be armed and dangerous. (Cop groans) I know this prick, he ain't no cop. He works down at the prison. (Glass tinkles) (intense music) (gun fires) The other's still back up the street. [Woman] What the hell are we gonna do now? We take care of our own. (Gentle guitar music) Absolutely, definitely. Gonna make a pickup for Alfonso. (Gentle guitar music) [Gloria] Wouldn't you rather have a drink with somebody else? I go with my heart, lady. Aw, Jojo I don't feel it. I know. Just have a drink with me. Weird thing about life. How do you love someone when you know you can't have 'em? I've known you pretty much your whole life. Loved you from afar. But I respect the brotherhood, and CW. I choose to keep my love for you as a brother would his sister. Junior looks like he's settling in pretty nicely, don't ya think?
