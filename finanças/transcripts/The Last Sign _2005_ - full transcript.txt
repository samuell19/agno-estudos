(car door clacking) So much pain, so much hurt, all for nothing. Or so it seemed. We like to think that bad things can only happen to other people but they don't, of course. After you died, Jeremy, I thought we might find some peace in our lives again. (doorbell ringing) But death is not always as final as we sometimes think it is. Is it? Yes? - Mrs. Macfarlane, we're from the real estate agency. - Oh, just a one second, I'll get the key. (keys clattering) I'm so sorry, I can't seem to find the keys. - Well, should we take a look at it from the outside? - Yes, of course. - Will you allow access to the garden? - Is that standard practise? - It's best to cover all possible options. - It's just that I have children. - Yes. (real estate agent chuckling) Well, I'll have a look at the back. Excuse me. (dramatic music) - I can't do it anymore. The kids and I are leaving. - You wanna leave me? - Mrs. Macfarlane? - Location's perfect. - Actually, we might have someone. - Oh, so soon. - A French engineer with excellent credentials. He came to work at the Rivercrest Dam Project. - It would be a short-term contract. - Oh, I don't know about that. - That way we can get you a much higher price. - Oh, well I'll, I'll have to think about it. - Mrs. Macfarlane. Please give us a call when you reach a decision. - I appreciate it. - Thank you. - Goodbye. (car engine whirring) (dramatic music) (key clattering) (upbeat pop music) - Hey, what'd you do that for? - It's crappy stuff, ah. - No it's not, Mom! - Please, girls. It's dinner time. Come on, it's dinner. - Okay, okay, we're coming. (upbeat pop music) Anyway, it's my stereo. You got roller blades for Christmas. - I wanted a stereo too! - Come on, you two. Why can't you just share? - Ask Aunt Isabel to get you one. - Oh, don't you dare. - Oh, yeah? But Mom. - Oh, come on. Please, let's just have a nice dinner. (motorcycle engine whirring) - They're on sale at the mall. I saw them. - Girls. - These are difficult times. - We've got to stick to our budget. - Excellent. (front door clacking) Many a truer word spoken in jest. - Jest, what's that? - How many times have I told you? You don't have a licence for that bike. - I stayed on the trail. See? Dirt, okay? - Good, then go wash up. - (sighing) Before or after dinner? - Don't push me. - (sighing) Fine. (crickets chirping) (pills rattling) (clock ticking) (Kathy sighing) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (branches rustling) - [Jeremy] Eight's my lucky number. You can write it without ever taking your pen off the paper. I think we should be married on the eighth. - [Kathy] Why the eighth? - [Jeremy] It's the infinite number. - [Kathy] Mm. - [Jeremy] There. - [Kathy] It goes on forever and forever and forever. - Mm-hmm. (branches rustling) - Come on, let's go kids. (atmospheric music) Seat belts. (car engine whirring) (dramatic music) Okay, love you. Mm. Have a good day. Temperature? - Regular. - Gauge? - Level. (machinery whirring) - Ooh, don't forget it. - Excuse me? - Your ring. - Oh, thanks. I don't think we've met, I'm-- - You're Kathy Macfarland, lab seven, you been here almost a month. (Kathy chuckling) - Right, I'm Endora, Human Resources. Do you know, I had you pegged for either a Cancer or a Leo. - I'm a Cancer, actually. - Ah-huh, I thought so because you're the only person who had the courage to eat the tuna melt on Thursday. - (laughing) Well, it's not that bad, really. - Yeah, tell me that in a month. - (laughing) Nice to meet you. - You too. Hmm. - There's not much I can do. Now, you do understand that if you don't make these payments within eight days, you risk repossession? - Yes, but I'm back at work now, and I intend to rent my late husband's medical clinic. - Um, let me see here. (keyboard clattering) (clock beeping) I might be able to give you a month. (dramatic music) Miss Macfarlane? - Sorry. - A month's extension, that's, that's about the best I can do. - I see, well, thank you. - Oh, it a started acting up this morning. It's the first time it's ever done that. - Oh, okay, well, thank you. (dramatic music) (car engine whirring) (keys jangling) - Hello there. (Kathy gasping) Oh, excuse me. I didn't mean to scare ya. Mrs. Macfarlane? - Yes. - I'm your new tenant, Marc Larrieu. It's a pleasure to meet you. - I'm sorry, I just wasn't expecting you. - Yes, I came early and your sister gave me the keys. I hope it's okay. - Yeah, it's fine. - By the way, I met your kids. They're great. If you prefer, I could come back tomorrow. - No, it's, it's, it's fine. Is everything okay, do you need anything? - Everything's perfect. Have a good night. - Goodnight. (ominous music) - Hi, Mom! - Oh, oh, goodness. - Why are home so late? - Uh, I was so busy at the lab. - Well, I kept your plate warm. - [Kathy] Thank you. - Have you met your new neighbour? - [Kathy] Yes. - He seems like a good guy. - Maybe. I'm starting to have second thoughts about renting out the cottage. - No, no, no, Kath, it's a good thing. Now you're gonna have some close company. - Exactly, that's what bothers me. (crickets chirping) (clock ticking) (voice whispering) (wind whispering) (ominous music) (phone ringing) Hello? (footsteps thudding) Hello? (voice whispering) Hello? - [Frank?} Who is it? - Nobody. Probably a wrong number. Go back to bed. - [Frank] (sighing) Okay. (wind whispering) (ominous music) - [Frank] What's that? - Your dad's old shoes from the clinic. Just some old junk. Come on, Isabel, let's go, we're late! - [Isabel] Coming, go, go girls. - Good morning, everybody. - Hello. - Morning. - [Kathy] Hurry up you guys, we're gonna miss the bus. - Hi, there. - Hi. - See you later, Isabel. (car engine whirring) (Kathy sighing) (dramatic music) (employees chattering) - [Endora] (clearing throat) You mind if I sit down here? - Oh, no, course not. - Well I see you're not having the tuna melt. - [Kathy] I took your advice. - Trouble at the bank there? - Just a little. - You're a widow, aren't you? - Yes, I am. - And you think about him all the time, don't you? You know, the first time I saw you, I knew we had something in common. My Pierre left this earth about 15 years ago, and I thought I would go crazy. I realised that he was watching out for me. He was talking to me. I talked back, hell, why not? (Kathy chuckling) And we do that all the time. Listen, I am throwing myself a birthday party on Saturday, so why don't you, why don't you just come and let your hair down? - I'm not much of a party person. - Gonna be 58, in case you were wondering. Don't look a day over 54, but I will be 58. And so no excuses, no presents, come. (ominous breathing) (dramatic music) - [Jeremy] I swear, baby, I swear. Never again, I swear, Kath, I swear. Not one more drop. Never again, I swear, I swear on my children. (ice cubes clinking) (atmospheric music) (children laughing) They all died, Kathy. All those beautiful kids. They all died. There was nothing I could do. (dramatic music) (wood banging) (glass shattering) (Jeremy grunting) (pot smashing) (dramatic music) (books clattering) (sighing) I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - [Kathy] We can't live like this anymore. (glass cracking) (clock ticking) (Kathy sighing) (crickets chirping) (group laughing and chattering) (ominous music) (phone ringing) (group laughing) (group laughing and chattering) - I tell ya, the man's party went on all night long. - God, what fun. (Kathy chuckling) You should have joined in instead of playing the loner. I'm telling you, Kath, you gotta start moving on. - I'm trying, Isabel. I can't. It's as if Jeremy's still here. I'm afraid I'm gonna wake up one night and find him on the couch in who knows what kind of state. - He really put you through hell, didn't he? - He's still at it. (girls laughing) It was just like him. His last selfish gesture in his own inimitable style, leaving us right when the kids needed him most. - Yeah, well they've got you. And they're wonderful kids. (girls laughing) Who'd wanna be one of them? No father and a hysterical mother. - You are a great mom, and they're very lucky to have you. (girls laughing) (atmospheric music) (Maggie blowing) (Fiona laughing) (branches rustling) (girls laughing) (Maggie blowing) (Fiona blowing) (branches rustling) (upbeat electronic music) - This is a tupilaq and this, this will help you ward off evil spirits. (Kathy chuckling) Mm-hmm, we could all use one of those, couldn't we? Isn't that gorgeous, look. Oh, darling, I didn't get you a drink. - Oh, I'm fine, really. - No, now what a bad hostess, come on. Come on, let's get you all set up, and loosen you up and put you in a party mood. - Endora. - Oh, Adam, my god, you look gorgeous in pink. Oh, mm. - Why, thank you, ah. - Darling, this is Kathy. Could you get her a drink? - Just a glass of water would be good. - Water, sort of real party, hmm? - Adam doesn't drink water. He's an artist. Oh, Zelda, oh, my god! I'll be right back.

That is a great choice. That's a perfect book for you. - Oh, it's not really my kind of thing. - Oh, you dropped your matches here. - Oh, they can't be mine, I don't smoke. - Well I certainly don't smoke, and I've never been to the Moon River Hotel. (ominous music) Is that a nice hotel? - Yes, it's a very nice hotel. - You know, I get the feeling that these are definitely your matches. - Huh. - Here, I'll tell you what. This book, this book, ah, is my gift to you. So why don't just make yourself comfortable and try and absorb some of the stuff you read in it, and then when you're ready, come and rejoin the party, okay?

I love you, Kathy. - Happily ever after. - Forever. - [Fergus] Mrs. Macfarlane? Mrs. Macfarlane? - I'm sorry, do we know each other? - Fergus O'Brien. Of the O'Brien Farm. - Oh, Fergus O'Brien. - That's me. - Oh, it's amazing, it's been years. - As they say, long time no see. (chuckling) - [Kathy] Yeah, right. Well how have you been, Fergus? - Oh, great. Fresh as a newborn. See. Too bad it's not something that you can just wash off. Well how are you doing yourself, Mrs. Macfarlane? - Not bad, fine really. You know, since Dr. Macfarlane left us. - Oh, the doctor would never leave you. He wouldn't do a thing like that. - No, Fergus, you don't understand, he's gone forever. - You'll see, he'll be back. - He's dead, Fergus, don't you get it, dead. - Yeah, right, but nothing's forever. He'll be back, Mrs. Macfarlane. I'm telling you, he'll be back. (elevator ringing) (ominous music) (windshield shattering) (girls screaming) - [Jeremy] You can't leave me! - I called the hospital, he's not there. - Oh, Kath, take it easy. He's just out with his friends somewhere. - Well then why doesn't he call me? - Because he's probably having too much fun. (car engine whirring) - Oh, Isabel, here comes a car. I'll call ya back. (crickets chirping) - Mrs. Macfarlane, your son's in the car. Ah, don't worry, he's okay. He got into a fight with a friend, but, ah, it's not - Oh. - as bad as it looks. And he was up on the road waiting till you'd gone to bed. - (sighing) He scared me to death. - [Marc] Don't be too hard on him. - Frank. Uh, what happened? God, look at you. Baby. - I'm fine, it's a bruise. - Frank? - He's just upset. Let's go clean him up. Don't move. Almost done. - So do I have to call Steve's father to find out what happened? - What did I tell ya? - Hey, your mother has a right to worry about you, you know? (atmospheric music) (clock ticking) (phone ringing) (ominous music) - Hello? (speaking in foreign language) - Is there a problem with Frank? - No. I, ah, I've been getting anonymous calls every night at 12:15, and I looked out my window and there you were and-- - And you thought it was me? How long has this been going on? - Ever since you came. - Anyone you suspect? From work, maybe? - No. - I think I know someone who can help. Don't worry, I'll take care of it tomorrow. - So, who are you calling so late? - France, my mother. She wakes up early. - Sorry about that. - That's okay. (atmospheric music) - [Endora] What in god's name are you doing, huh? Kathy, what's up here? - I lost my ring. I guess I didn't take your advice seriously. - Oh, honey, I am so sorry. What a shame. (electronic zapping) Ooh, gosh, wow, I don't know why that keeps happening to me. - Because you're full of energy. - I wish, the rest of time I'm completely drained. - Is there something you wanna tell me, huh? - No, I don't think so. - Just a thought. - Well, I better get back to work. - Okay. (customers chattering) - Hi. - Hi. - Here, that's every single call you got this month including the unknown numbers. But you didn't get it from me, right? - [Marc] Right, ah, Rachel, Kathy. Kathy's my landlady. - I really appreciate this. - [Rachel] It's no problem. Look, I gotta run. They'll be wondering where I am. - [Marc] I owe ya one. (Kathy gasping) (ominous music) - As I've told you, our records don't show any call to that number. - Look, mister, some lunatic in this hotel gets his kicks every night by tormenting this lady. So unless you help us, we are going to the police, is that clear? - I understand your concern, but our records read-- - Look, if I could just talk to Fergus O'Brien. He's a bellboy here. - Ruth? - Yes? - Is there a Fergus O'Brien working here? - He's a little skinny guy. 20-something. - Bell boy. - Never heard of him. - But I just spoke with him here the other night. - I don't know any Fergus O'Brien, ma'am. (ominous music) - Miss, I would like to speak to the manager. - Okay, follow me. - Excuse me, I'm looking for another bellboy that works here. His name is Fergus O'Brien. - Ah, it's just me and Rudy. Are you going up? (elevator ringing) (atmospheric music) - Okay, here's what I got. Ah, the Moon River Hotel hires people off the books. They're not gonna tell us the whole story but I talked to the manager and tomorrow, they're gonna teach that kid a lesson. So no more phone calls. - Oh, I hope so. - Ah, what's your connection with this Fergus? - He was a patient of my husband's. - I see. - Thanks, Marc. - You're welcome. (clock ticking) (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (washer whirring) (metal clanking) - Jesus, what is he doing, for God's sake, trying to kill himself? We should call an ambulance. I thought he'd stopped. (metal clattering in washer) (dramatic music) (door clicking) (water spraying) (ominous music) (water spraying) (ominous music) (voice whispering) (test tubes clinking) - [Endora] Kathy? Wanna have lunch? - Look. - Oh, my god, where was it? - In the laundry, but I'm positive I lost it here. - Oh, well it found you. (Kathy chuckling) - Objects can travel thousands of miles if they've got a reason, you know? It's a sign. - Yes, of my negligence - No, it is a sign that Jeremy is trying to get in touch with you. - I never told you his name. (ominous music) Ah, yes, human resources. - Kathy, you've gotta listen. I can help you get in touch with him. - It's not really my kind of thing. (branches rustling) (wrench clanking) - Hand me a number 11. - Yeah. (tools clinking) Here you go, man. - Yeah. (wrench clicking) - Got it? - Oh, yeah, that should do it. - Yeah. - You owe me 50 bucks, man. - We'll give ya a break on the room. - Okay, that'll work. - Hi there. - Hi. - [Frank] Hey, Ma. - Didn't hear ya coming. - [Kathy] I guess you were too busy. - Well, it's all done. - Wow. - Yeah, I'm gonna take it for a ride right now. Be back in a minute. - Alright, just to the gate. - Mom, come on. - Not on the road. (motorcycle engine revving) - Anymore phone calls? - No. - Good. (tools clinking) - So you know about motorcycles? - Ah, well, I had one when I was a kid. - I, ah, I really appreciate you helping Frank with his. - Yeah, I hope he rides better than he fights. - (laughing) Yeah, me too. - You got something in your hair. (atmospheric music) - Huh, that's strange. I wonder where that came from. (motorcycle engine whirring) - It's great. Not a drop of oil. (crickets chirping) - And they lived happily ever after. The end. Now, go to sleep. - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight, baby. Sweet dreams. - Sweet dreams. - Okay, sweetie. - Mom? - Yes. - You got a minute? Look, I know, ah, things between us haven't been good. I know Dad hurt you a lot. I hate him for it. - Don't hate your dad. He was a very sick man, and I just couldn't cope. - Mm-hmm. (atmospheric music) I just want you to be happy. - I'm sorry I've been so hard on you lately. It's just that I worry. You scare me. So impulsive. A lot of ways, you're just like your dad. - I am? - Yeah. Only the best parts. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mom. (atmospheric music) (children laughing) - [Jeremy] Mommy's here now, stop, stop jumping on the couch. (grunting) - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, Mommy. - Hi. (door clanking) - Hey, I love you - Bye. - Have fun, mm, mm. - Miss you. - Bye, I'll miss you. - Hey, girls. - Thank you so much. - Put your seat belts on now. - You're very welcome. - Here we go. - Call me as soon as you - Three. - get there. - Don't we always? - Two, - Have some fun. - Don't, don't worry. - one! - [Al] Lift off! (children cheering) (crowd cheering) - Get him out, Frank! (ball thudding in glove) Yeah! (crowd cheering) Hey, there. - What's happening? - Frank's team is winning. All the pressure is on Frank. (crowd cheering) Yeah! - Who gave him the number eight? - I don't know. Come on, Frank! You can do it! - Go Frank! - You can do it! - Come on, come on! (ball thudding in glove) - Yeah. (crowd cheering) Yeah, yeah! (crowd cheering) Yeah, Frank! - Good job, boys! - Yeah! - Hey, Mom. - Wow, what a game. - Hey, bravo. - Yeah, well you know, we got lucky. - Hey, come on, you're too much. - You should have placed a bet, man. - You're right, I should have. How about we go celebrate? - Oh, um, we're actually going out for burgers. - Well don't be late. - Alright, I'll see you guys later. Let's go, boys. - Ya hungry? - A little bit. I'll have an espresso. - Me too. (customers chattering) - So, where's home? - Oh, well, that's a tough one. I do have this little place near Paris, but it's locked up most of the time. - [Kathy] No kids? - I never had to chance to pursue a meaningful relationship. - That's too bad. You're really good with kids. My kids really like you. Especially Frank and he doesn't make friends easy. - [Marc] Neither do I. - You don't give me that impression. - (chuckling) What impression do I give? That of a strange guy who makes crank phone calls in the middle of the night just to attract your attention? Thanks. What about your husband? - Oh, Jeremy was an idealist. He thought that medicine could change the world. Up until the moment he joined a relief organisation moment abroad. - Where? - Central Africa. That's where he started drinking. He used to say the politics of food and medical aid was a lousy business. (atmospheric music) It's not fun to talk about. - Yeah. - All I Know is I'm tired, old and ugly. - You may be tired, but you're not old and you're certainly not ugly. In fact, I'd be happy to tell you how you're beautiful every time I see you. - Okay, it's a deal. (atmospheric music) - Would you like to come in for a drink? - Oh, I don't think I should. I had a really good time tonight. (romantic music) (wind whispering) (Kathy moaning) (ominous music) (Kathy groaning) (Kathy crying) (car engine stalling) Come on, if we hurry we can catch the bus. - [Frank] We could always take my bike. - Yeah, right, I don't think so. - Mom? - Yeah. - Do you like Marc? - He seems like a nice person. - Yeah, do you like him? - Look, hurry. (ominous music) - Oh, hello, stranger. - Hi, hi. - How are ya, Kathy? - Oh, fine, thanks. - Come and see me when you're ready. - I'm sorry, I'm in a rush. - Okay. - Frank called me. Your battery was flat. Probably the humidity. - Oh, thanks for coming to get me. I could have taken the bus. - It's not a problem. I finished early. Music? (atmospheric music) There's something I should tell you. My stay here might be shorter than I thought. My bosses in Europe overestimated the extent of the work here, and I have a new assignment in another country. - And you accepted? - I told them I, I hadn't made up my mind yet. - I see. (horn beeping) Well, we'll miss you. - Hey. - Oh, my beautiful babies. - Mommy! - I missed you. - They had a great time. - Thank you so much. - Hey, girls, oh, yes. - Mom, can Marc have dinner with us? - Oh, what about Auntie Isa and Uncle Al? - Sure, yeah. - No, no, no. - No? - No, thanks. - I guess we just wanna get back home, right? - Yeah. - Okay, thank you. - Okay. - Okay, anytime. - Bye, bye girls. - Bye, girls. - Bye! - Goodbye. - The man taking your place, is he gonna be as nice as you? - Well. - [Maggie] What's his name? - I don't know. It's not official yet. - Yeah, right, send us a postcard. - Oh, Frank. - We don't want you to leave. - Shut up, Fiona. - You shut up. - You guys, what is wrong with you? (utensils clinking) - Nothing. Nothing at all. - Look, there's no reason why Marc can't still be our friend. - Maybe I should talk to him. - [Kathy] Sure, that'd be nice. - Yeah. (Kathy sighing) He won't talk to me. - [Kathy] He doesn't want you to leave. - You know, Kathy. I've been travelling around the world for too long now. I wouldn't mind settling down. (atmospheric music) For a good reason. (ominous music) What is it? - Nothing. I'm sorry. I just can't. - Okay. (ominous music) (clock ticking) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) - Mommy? Mommy? (phone ringing) - Cut it out, Fergus, just cut it out. - Mommy! - It's okay, sweetheart. Go back to bed. (ominous music) (clock ticking) (Kathy breathing heavily) (breathing heavily) (ominous music) (voice whispering) (Kathy sighing) (ominous music) (voice whispering) 555-0167, O'Brien, it just goes dead. Are you sure? And there's no new number? Okay, thank you. (ominous music) (Kathy breathing heavily) (fire crackling) Oh, hell, Jeremy. It's the O'Brien's. (dramatic music) - Shit, I don't have my bag. - It's Fergus! Oh, my God. It's Fergus, he stopped breathing! Please save him. - [Jeremy] Out of the way! (Emily crying) (Jeremy grunting) One, two, three four. One, two, three, four. (Fergus coughing) (Fergus coughing) (fire crackling) - [Emily] Okay, you're okay. You're okay. (dramatic music) - Fergus. - Mrs. Macfarlane. Am I glad to see you. - I'm afraid I can't say the same. - I, ah, quit the hotel, you know. I wasn't cut out for the job. I heard you came looking for me? - You tell me the truth, Fergus. Are you the one that's been calling me? - 12:15 precisely, every night. - That's not some kind of joke, frightening people like that. - I was doing a friend a favour. - What friend? - Dr. Macfarlane, of course. - That's not funny. - Well he asked me to contact you to tell you that-- - Stop that. - He wants you to, ah, - [Emily] Hey, there! - I'm going to have a word with your mother. - Mrs. Macfarlane. Well, this is such a pleasant surprise. - [Kathy] Hello, Emily. - Please, do come in, I'll give ya some coffee. - No, I'm fine, thank you. - Oh, okay. Ah, how long has it been, huh? Five years. My god, how time flies. So what brought you into the neighbourhood? - I'm actually here to talk to you about Fergus. - My son, Fergus. What about him? - I don't know why, but I thought that you should know. Fergus has been calling me almost every night for the past two weeks. - Are you alright, Mrs. Macfarlane? - Yes, why? - Fergus is dead. Been dead for six months. (ominous music) You should know that. (dramatic music) (lightning cracking) (lightning cracking) (laughing on TV) (lightning cracking) (cartoonish whirring on TV) (laughing on TV) (lightning cracking) (lightning cracking) (ominous music) (keys clattering) (door creaking) (lightning cracking) (lightning cracking) (ominous music) (lightning cracking) (wind whispering) (voice whispering) (dramatic music) (lightning cracking) (ominous music) (lightning cracking) (dramatic music) (lightning cracking) - Frank, I'm. - Alright, come here. It's just the rain, you guys. Don't worry, it's fine. (chattering on TV) What's up? - We're going down Isabel's. - What, now? - Yes, right away. Get your coats on quick. (lightning cracking) (lightning cracking) (wind howling) (door banging) (Fiona and Maggie yelping) - The storm. - Just do as I say. - I'm not going. - Oh, yes you, I'm your mother, now get in the car. - [Fiona] Why Mommy? (lightning cracking) (ominous music) (lightning cracking) (car engine stalling) - Damn it. (car stalling) - You're flooding it, take your foot off the gas. (car engine revving) - Stop! Kathy! No! - This is crazy. (dramatic music) - Mom! - [Jeremy] Don't leave me! (windshield shattering) (girls screaming) I'll get you! I'll find you, Kathy! Wherever you go, I'll find you! - What the hell are you doing? Slow down. (dramatic music) (branches rustling) - [Al] What's going on? Hi, sweetie. - Where's Isabel? - Back inside, come on, get in, get in. What's going on? - You know the phone calls I've been getting at 12:15? It's Jeremy's time of death, 12:15. - Yeah, some crank at the record's office. - No, Isabel. Jeremy died the night I left him, and this kid Fergus came back from the dead to tell me something. - Oh, Kathy. - No, Isabel it really-- - Kathy, you are so stressed out. - (sighing) He's making the phone calls because he owes Jeremy a favour. - Okay, the dead don't make phone calls, honey. Why don't you let the kids stay with us for a while? - Yes, they need protection. - Yeah, will this isn't the way to do it. You're scaring the hell out of them. - He said he would come after us no matter where we went. - Oh, honey, that's not gonna happen. The dead don't scare me. Just couch potatoes do that. (Kathy chuckling) Let's go make up the rooms. (dramatic music) - I knew you'd finally come, come on. - Oh, I can't believe this is happening to me. Maybe I'm going crazy. - Mm-mm, mm-mm, you're not, I promise you. Now I want you to try and see this from another perspective, alright? Maybe death doesn't really exist. (Kathy chuckling nervously) Maybe it's just a gateway to another reality. - But I'm a scientist, Endora. I only believe in things that can be proven. - watchoo, tchoo, tchoo, tchoo, tchoo, tchoo. Now, try and see this experience as a blessing. Ah, very people get this opportunity. Now you told me that the bellboy said he thought he was doing Jeremy a favour, is that right? - Yes. - I think that your Jeremy sent Fergus to talk to you because he wanted to talk to you himself but he couldn't. I think he's in a lot of pain. - (sighing) Jeremy doesn't exist. I buried him, he's just dirt and worms. - We're going to try and contact him. Just gonna try. Just try, don't be scared, okay? So I want you to put your hands flat down on the table. I want you to relax. Just relax and breathe from here, and slowly and in two, that's it, relax. Relax all this. (Kathy sighing) There ya go. Two, three, four. Oh, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Oh, one, two, two. Open yourself up to Jeremy. Open yourself up, Kathy, open yourself up. (ominous music) (Endora inhaling) (wind whispering) (voice whispering) (dramatic music) (branches rustling) (Endora exhaling) (branches rustling) (wind howling) - [Jeremy] I'm sorry. - Oh. - No, I can't. - Jeremy needs you to forgive him, Kathy. - I, I'm just confused. That's all. I shouldn't have come, Endora. - You have got to forgive him for your own piece of mind. You gotta throw out the bad stuff and focus on the good moments. - Yes, good moments. - Look for the signs, Kathy. Look for the signs. (ice cube clinking) (customers chattering) (ice cubes clinking) (customers chattering) - Scotch, please. Make that two. I'm expecting someone. (ice cubes clinking) I need to know what it feels like. Oh, yeah, stop pretending you quit drinking. (coins clattering) (ominous music) (door creaking) (clock ticking) (ominous music) - [Jeremy] Kath? - Jeremy? (water spraying) Jeremy? (water spraying) - How have you been? - Kathy? It's Marc. - Happy birthday. (ominous music) (ring clinking on sink) - Anybody home? I came looking for the kids earlier, but, ah, I brought something for them. - (sighing) They're at Isabel's house for a few days. - Well, ah, I'll leave them here. There something wrong? - No, I don't think so. - Come on, there's something wrong. Talk to me. - [Kathy] No. - Why won't you give us a chance, Kathy? Stop punishing yourself. - (sighing) That's not it. - Then what? (Kathy sighing) - Okay, fine. I see him. I hear him. At times, I feel like I can almost touch him. And then there's all these signs. - [Marc] What signs? - Eights, I see them constantly. It's like he's trying to tell me something and I just can't figure it out. - Kathy, what's happening to you it what grief is all about. You miss Jeremy so much that you attach an emotional value to what your mind's showing you. - You still don't understand. - Trust me. I've gotta catch my plane. (dramatic music) - [Kathy] Contrary to popular belief, the most difficult aspect of grief is not so much the absence of the loved one as the sudden interruption of communication. (lock clacking) (keys jangling) (clock ticking) (car engine whirring) (dramatic music) (door clacking) (birds chirping) (keys jangling) (door creaking) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (footsteps crunching gravel) - Trouble? (ominous music) - I can't do it anymore. The kids and I are leaving. - You wanna leave me? - I think it's best. (wind whirring) - [Frank] Mom, what are you doing here? - Nothing. - I'm looking for Marc, is he around? - He went to the airport. - I can't believe you let him go. Why, he's a good guy, there's nothing wrong with him. You think, you think you're the only one who misses Dad? - That's not fair. - Then why, Mom? Why not Marc? You can't keep acting like this. It's insane. You gotta let things get better. - You're right. It's gonna be better. I have to go pick up the girls at Isabel's. (birds chirping) - [Endora] I think that your Jeremy sent Fergus to talk to you because he wanted to talk to you himself be he couldn't. - [Fergus] He asked me to contact you to tell you that he wants you to, ah. - [Endora] Jeremy needs you to forgive him, Kathy. - [Fergus] He wants you to, ah, forgive him. (truck horn blaring) (tyres screeching) (dramatic music) - [Marc] Why won't you give us a chance, Kathy? - [Kathy] I'm sorry, I just can't. (atmospheric music) - [Frank] Why not Marc? I can't believe you let him go. He's a good guy, there's nothing wrong with him. It's insane. You gotta let things get better. - Passport and plane ticket, please. Thank you. - Excuse me, just a moment, give me five minutes, okay. - [Frank] You can't keep acting like this. (truck horn blaring) (branches rustling) (wind howling) (Jeremy whispering) - [Jeremy] I love you, but I know you can hear me now. I'm sorry. (dramatic music) I'm so sorry. I just wanted to give you a chance to live free of all the anger and violence. I love you. (dramatic music) I need you to do one more thing for me, Kathy. Even the dead need to be forgiven. And I need you to forgive me Kathy. Please forgive me. - [Kathy] I hated you for a long time, you know that. I can't do it anymore. (children laughing) I forgive you. - [Jeremy] Get on with your life, honey. Just be happy. - I forgive you. (horns blaring) (knocking on window) (phone ringing) (clock ticking) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) (wind whispering) The kids will be so happy to see you. (wind howling) (dramatic music)
