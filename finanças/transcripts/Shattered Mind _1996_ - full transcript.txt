(suspenseful introductory music) Multiple personality, I don't feel right calling it that, That's like I'm possessed. Dissociative disorder. That's better, yeah. That's much better. Like I can't make connections with my selves or with the world. It's like, sometimes I'll open a door somewhere, and I'll be in a whole different place altogether. And it'll be two hours later, or even a whole day or night. I just lose track of time in between. (suspenseful music begins) Like when I met Sean, I don't really remember that, or the wedding. Though everybody tells me I was never happier. I do remember Molly being born. Oh God. That's when I learned what love really meant. And when Rosie came along, feeling just doubled. Having my family made me believe that everything was gonna turn out wonderful after all. Then my father was in his office last August and everything came unglued. Jim. Jim? (Jim groaning) Jim? Hello, Jim? Jim? (suspenseful music intensifies) Dr. Tremayne? (telephone ringing) Oh my God. (telephone ringing) Hello. Oh, my God. Suzy. Suzy! (hurried footsteps thumping) Mom. He's asked for you. Daddy, Daddy. Hi, hi, hi. Hi, Daddy. (monitor beeping) Jim? Jimmy? Code blue! (nurses and doctors frantically speaking) Code blue, I need an EpiPen. Coming through. I need the paddles please, give me a charge. Get in here with the paddles Oh, my God, somebody! (heart monitor goes flat) Clear! One more time, go in again. Clear! Oh my God. Oh my God! Give me a charge again, one more time. Daddy! Clear! Bonnie, look what I did. Good honey. Is it okay maybe if I play too? If you want to that'd be fun. (tense suspenseful music) Look what mommy's doing. I wanna do that. (girls giggling) So what's going on? We're coloring, Daddy. Yeah. Girls, why don't you go inside, and clean your face and your hands. Come on, let's go. Lookie my pretty picture. What are you doing? Why aren't you dressed? We have to be there in 15 minutes. Where? The funeral. Uh, I can't go like this. No kidding. You take the girls. I'll get dressed and I'll meet you there, okay? (door bell jingling) Hi, can I help you? Do you see this dress? This is a really nice one. And so it is said, that I say Dr. Tremayne was far more than just a caring citizen, and a loving husband and father. He was more even, then one of those rare- (fades out). Another scotch, hun. Ginger. It's Huff. Sup? Heard you were living with some guy. Oh yeah, on and off. Wanna make some money? Eddie, looking for a game? Sure, why not. Eddie, this is Ginger. Hey Ginger. How ya doing? I'm doing just fine. (slow sensual music) You owe me 20 more. (Eddie and Ginger moaning) You like that? You like that? Come on. No, no. What happened? Everybody's freaking out. You missed the funeral. I called and called, why didn't you answer? Who are you? Suzy cut it out. Come on, wake up. We gotta call your mom, she's frantic. Mom? Mommy! Shh! We waited a half hour for you before we started the funeral. My head hurts! (Sean sighs) You want some aspirin? I can't swallow. Do you want those baby aspirin again? Stay! Stay. Shh, take it easy. It's okay. Don't leave me. Dad, my daddy. (Suzy crying) I know, I know. It's awful. I remember when my father died. I was crazy too. Sean. I missed him. Oh my god. (dramatic music begins) I'm sorry Daddy, I wasn't here. I'm sorry I missed your funeral. I'll be a good girl, I will. The door opened, and his father peered in. "You're already dressed," he said. "Yes," said Bertick. Mom, Dad's skipping again! No I'm not! "Yes," said Bertick, that's not skipping. Yes you are, right there. (Sean chuckles) Mom, can you read to us? Sure. Hello. Thanks, Dad. You're impossible. Right there. Okay. "Stick out your tongue," said his father. "more, more, more! Say Ah." Ahhh. "Your throat is clear, your nose is stuffed. I'll make some broth," said Bertick's mother. Ewwww. Ew? Have you girls brushed your teeth? I have! No you haven't I have. Yes I have. Get in there, I'll finished the story after. Mommy, I have too! No you haven't, you get in there. That big monster's gonna get you if you don't go. (girls squealing) Brush your teeth, brush your teeth. Good girls. Suzy? Where'd this money come from? My sock drawer. Well it was on the floor. Well, it must have slipped out. I'm waitressing again. Where? It's only part- time. Well who's taking care of the girls? My mom, mostly. Are you okay with that? I have to be, 'til we get ahead. Then maybe I can take some classes. (phone ringing) Classes? What are you talking about? Hello. Ginger. Got you another date. I'm sorry, what number are you calling? Oh, I get it. I get it, that guy's there huh? Listen, call me back on my car phone, okay? You must have the wrong number, there's no one here by that name. What kind of classes are you talking about? For teaching. I wanna be a teacher. For what? You always hated school. I want to work, okay? We've got bills to pay, and I don't want to have to ask my mom for money. She's got problems of her own anyway. Look, I'm sorry I'm not a doctor like your father was, but at least give me enough respect that if you get a job, to tell me about it. Sean, where are you going? To put the girls to bed. (girls squealing and laughing) Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy. Mommy, come out and do the new one. Hold your horses. Aww. Mom, please. Come out. Ready? Down by the river where the green grass grows. One, two, three, four, five. (girls giggling) (ominous music) Come on. It seems you've inherited some of my brother's lawsuits. Malpractice suits. Yes, I just found out about it, It's nothing to worry about, it happens all the time. I'm going to tell your mother on Thursday. Oh, it doesn't matter what you tell Martha, she only believes what she wants to. Well, if you need money, I'm sure she'd give you a loan. Loan? I earned that money. In what sense, Suzy? I was counting on it. That's what I meant. (cars screeching) (echoing of cars and tires screeching) (ominous music begins) Car? Mommy? Daddy? (car alarm beeping) Where's the car? Where'd I put my car? Car? Bad car, bad. Bad, where were you hiding, car? Bad, bad, bad car. Bad. Bad car. Bad. Suzy? What? You were talking about McWhorter College. What about it? You said you wanted to go there. It's only $300 a credit. What about the SATs? Don't they require around 1,200? Girls, please be careful over there. I'll get it, I'll get 1,200. Maybe you shouldn't set your sights quite so high. Remember all the trouble you were having in school? You really don't remember? Maybe that's why you don't test well. Which is only one kind of intelligence, but unfortunately is what school's all about. Mom, I want to be a teacher. I wanna help people, I wanna make things clear. I understand. Just because you didn't work. What are you talking about? I managed a restaurant from the time you were 11. I swear, sometimes your brain is like Swiss cheese. Here. Oh, I can't take any more of your money, Mom. You said you needed a loan. Just now, at lunch. Don't you remember? Of course. It's just that I... I know how you feel. I feel awful sometimes myself. Some days since your dad is gone, I feel like... So please let me, let me help you. Take this. (cars revving) (dogs barking) (bar patrons chattering) All right darling, here's the deal. It's a twofer. Think you're up for it? A no in the winter? Gotta make up for next week. Why, where are you going? This guy and his kids. Suzy? His family reunion. Suzy? Sorry, hun, you want something? You're Suzy Tremayne. English Three? Or I hope so. Name's Ginger. Hey, your dad was a doctor, right? Wasn't his name Jim Tremayne? Yeah, what about him? So now your name is Ginger, huh? My dad knew your dad. Don't know why that gonna impress me. Well he died recently, didn't he? Your dad? Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude. I really have to go. Whoa, hey, Ginger. Hey, hey, where you going? Hey, settle down now. I have to pick up my kids. Oh, suddenly they're your kids, huh? You know, I went to some trouble here Ginger. And you're making me look bad. You're embarrassing me. All right, gentlemen. Ginger, come here sweetheart. Hey, come here. Where the hell are you going? Open up, open up. Daddy no. Daddy no, no, no. Listen to your daddy. Please Daddy, no. Suzy, no. (banging on door) Ginger Open up. Open up. Ginger, I need you to open up now. (door banging gets louder) No, no! Hey, where you going? Don't touch me, don't touch me! You are really getting drifty, aren't you? Let's go get some coffee. No, no coffee or tea. All right, let the lady through. Lady? Look like a hooker to me. Hey, she's all right. The bigger the mouth, the smaller it is. Hey, why don't we go check that out? Yeah? Oh yeah? (loud punch) (ominous music begins) Hey, Ginger! Where you going, baby? Come on back. (car starts) Hey Ginger! Now you did it. (ominous music intensifies) (cars honking) Suzy? Hey Mom. Kids give you any trouble? No, I just popped by to help with dinner. I meant last week. Last week what? Suzy, where are the children? Oh no. Molly, Rosie! Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay! We made a fort. Or, it's a castle. Mom, what's for dinner? Can we have macaroni? Dinner. (girls laughing) Can I go in the basket? Oh, I've gotta stop, girls stay right here. Okay. (suspenseful music begins) What is this, who got all this? Mommy, you did. I'm sorry, they won't take your card. What do you mean? Ginger spent it. What? She doesn't want us to go to school. Excuse me. Oh boy. Why don't you just step in traffic and get it over with? Shut up. Excuse me? Ma'am are you all right? You're losing it Suzy. You're going insane? Where are you going? Molly come on. You have three hours to work on the questions in this test book. There are five 30-minute sections, and two 15-minute sections. Okay? Break your seals and open the booklets. Now, if you finish in the allotted time you may go back and work on this section, but you may not go on to any other section. Is that clear? Begin. Oh gosh. (Suzy sighs) Dummy. So stupid. (Suzy quietly mumbles to herself) Sorry I'm late. Honey? I got promoted. I mean, it still sucks, but I'll be making more money and (loud kiss) I won't be on the loading dock anymore. That's great. And you're going to school. No, I'm not gonna get into school. Come on, stop that. No, I'm not. Look at me. Oh, my, my, my, we're eager. (Sean laughs) (Sean and Suzy moaning) Oh Sean. Oh, Suzy. (children laughing) Sean. Sean! Sean? Sean? Sean? (suspenseful music) Sweetie, time for dinner! Itchy, itchy, itchy Honey, come on! Get off me itchy clothes. Get off. Didn't you hear your mom? What's the matter? Get out of here! Get out of here! (loud repeated punching) (Jim groaning in pain) (Suzy groaning in pain) Honey? Suzy? Suzy where are you? I'm right here. Hun, I thought you were packing. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on, your mom's freaking out. Why? We're running late, traffic's gonna be real bad. (kids laughing) Maybe I'll teach kindergarten. I'm good with children. Or maybe outro. Okay. Mom, I got a 710 on my math, I'm getting into McWhorter. Suzy, you barely finished high school. There's no way- All I know is I'm getting in. Who's gonna watch the kids? Sean. How's he gonna do that? I don't know, it was good enough for you and Dad. Your dad and I had money to hire help. Yes, Martha. And why didn't I get any of that money? Suddenly I'm Martha. Is something wrong with your hand? I'll tell you why I didn't get the money. Because his patients are suing the estate. That's nonsense, who told you that? Let me see your hand. Chester did, he told me. That's ridiculous. Why would Chester lie to you? Martha, what color is this frying pan? What are you talking about? The color. Black. Just checking. I just thought you might think it was white. Suzy. (Jim whistling) Back bitch. Stop hiding it. Stop it! Stop! Suzy, Suzy stop it Suzy? Martha? Suzy, where are you going? Come back here. Sean, Sean help her. (suspenseful music begins) Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. (Suzy breathing heavily) Stupid. Stupid. Suzy! Let me go! Let me. Let go! No! (Suzy grunting) Suzy! Suzy. Suzy. Suzy. Okay. Come on, go, go. Honey? Suzy? Suzy? I wanna go around. (Suzy crying) Honey. Honey, it's okay. Suzy? Honey? Honey, it's just me. (Suzy shrieks) It's okay, it's okay. It's all right. Sh, it's okay. And what do these voices say? Well, some are telling me to die. And some are telling me to live. When does this happen? When you're tired? Yeah. She's worried about the children. I imagine so. Wake up, Chester. We need a psychiatrist. You mean, for the family. A family therapist. Is that what I mean? Well, I think that'd be best. It's not free, but maybe your mother will help out. I'll make some calls. In the meantime, I want you to take this for depression, and this to help prevent the panic. (Suzy mumbling) Sometimes I feel like different people. I understand. Some days you're up. Some days you're down. The bigger the silverware, the closer to the plate, and napkins on your right. This is a dirty spoon, maybe I should wash it. Hey! Daddy's home! Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Hey you! Hey girls, how you doing? Good. (quiet thud) Hey, be careful sweetie. Be careful. (Sean chuckles) So did you fill the prescription? Mhmm. Yeah, the pills working? On me they are. Huh? I'm a happy zombie. Oh. You smell good. You smell like a (loud kissing) raw onion. (Sean grunts) Hey, what was that for? Come on. Gimme your hands you little brats. It's time to wash your hands. (girls crying) Don't talk to the girls like that. What's wrong with you? You wash your hands. It's no use Pigeon. Nobody gets it. (door slams) (Suzy breathing heavily) (ominous music) Now just sit down. Sit down, I'll be right back, okay? Yeah, get some bread. (Suzy shouting) (rapid knocking at door) What's going on? She won't talk to me. She's scared to death of me. Has this ever happened before? Yeah, but I've always been able to snap her out of it. (Suzy calmly typing) Suzy? Suzy, it's Chester. What are you working on? My college application. I'm taking 12 credits at McWhorter. Didn't Suzy tell you? No. Suzy didn't tell me. Well that's probably because Suzy doesn't know. You see what I mean? You understand, don't you Chester? No, I'm sorry I don't. Then please, help us find someone who does. We're here to see Dr. Mullins. Certainly. I'll be in a room and I'll wonder, "what am I doing here? What did I come in here for?" Have you been drinking more lately? No, I can't stand the taste of alcohol. Then how do you account for the blackouts? Well, I don't take drugs, so maybe it's because I've been so stressed out lately. [Female Therapist] And your cat scan was normal. So when you're stressed, is that when you start to talk to yourself? Never out loud. But how would you know, if you're losing whole days? It's hard to say. What did the other doctors have to say? The other doctors. I mean, how many doctors have you seen so far? Um, two, three, four? You don't remember. I, I thought that's why I was sent to you. Your specialty is amnesia. In a way, in a way. Actually, my specialty is dissociative disorders, in which memory loss is one of the symptoms. Dissociative. No, it doesn't matter, it's just a term. What's more important is this memory loss. Now how long has this been happening? Um. No, it's okay. Can you tell me your earliest memory? Um. Oh, god. I'm sorry, is there someplace you have to be? My children. I have to leave here by four to pick them up. My mom's watching them. Mrs. Mitchell, do you remember what you told me on the phone? About my mom? Is that what you want me to do, talk about my mom? Well sure, if that's what you want to talk about. Because, I really can't afford this. Money's very tight right now. I don't know where it all goes, I'm just, I'm terrible with money. It's probably my biggest problem in life. Other than the voices? They're not really voices, it's just me talking to myself. You know, the way everybody does. Okay. I see. Let's go back to the money, all right? Who's been spending it? We don't have any money. We can't pay for this. That's all there is to it. We? Me and Sean. What did you think I meant? I'm sorry, I really have to go. Now Mrs. Mitchell- I don't have a very good memory. Coming home from the hospital with Molly. She's nine years old, that's as far back as I can remember, okay? I'm sorry, I'm really sorry if that sounds weird to you. No, no. That doesn't sound weird to me. Why don't we sit down and we can work this out. No, I'm late. Sorry. You've been very kind. Thank you. He's not even a medical doctor. Suzy, what did he tell you? Nothing, he thinks I'm a freak. He's trying to put ideas in my head. Come on honey, that sounds a little crazy to me. See, you think I'm a nut, too. Sean please, I'm tired, and I've been from one doctor to another. It's helped, it really has. I just want to get back to my life. Why are you looking at me like that? Suzy's great with the girls. I mean, they're great kids, They're strong, they love her. I mean, there's no better mother on Earth. Go on. Well, you know, sometimes she goes into these modes. You do, you just don't realize it. What kind of modes? Well, there's the little girl mode, when she doesn't want to know me. Then lately, if I even try to touch her, she goes into this butch routine. (Suzy gasps) I do not! That's not true. What do you call it? You're awful to me, you treat me like- I understand. Well she does. Stop this, please. (Sean sighs) Tell me about when the two of you first met. Suzy was working at a bar, dancing. Y'know, nothing that raunchy, just kind of bikini dancing. Can you believe it, this shy thing? So when did things begin to change? When Molly was born, our oldest girl. It sort of spelled the end of the party girl. Did it Suzy? No, for me everything was fine. That's not true. It's like you just disappeared, and we didn't have sex for months. Do you recall that Suzy? No. She's lying. Why are you doing this? He's trying to help us. You don't remember, do you? No. Stop fighting this, damn it. You stop fighting it. And you step back. Hi, how are you. (Suzy sighs) How do you think I am? I don't know. Fed up, already, with both of you. Okay, that's fair. Don't give me that flossy crap. Didn't I tell you he wasn't straight up? Yeah, sort of. But at least you're being honest now. Cut the crap, what do you want? Whatever you wanna tell me. Here we go again with your lame ass questions. Okay, okay. Do you spend Suzy's money. Don't put Ginger's moves on me. Ginger. Who's Ginger? Damn it, damn it, you stupid slut. Stupid, stupid, dumb. (Suzy quietly mumbling) She does this sometimes. Suzy. Suzy, honey. Suzy. Did you hear any of that? Sean. I know things have been kind of weird lately, but your mom, she's been going through something. You know, I get upset with her, and then she forgets to do some things, like picking you up at school. Dad, it's okay. No, it's not okay. It's gotta be pretty scary. Now your mom and I, we're trying to deal with it. Sometimes your mom's your mom, and then sometimes she's like somebody else, and every since Grandpa died, it's starting to get worse. We know Dad. No, you see, it's more complicated than that. It's not like sometimes she's happy, sometimes she's sad. It's more complicated than that. Daddy, we know. How do you know? Can we still play with Bonnie? Who's Bonnie? The one who likes to play. Why is Bonnie lying in the corner? To sleep. Why? 'Cause, she's gonna have to leave. Well, she's gonna come back. No. Never. Why not? 'Cause everybody's fighting about money. Well fighting about money isn't good, why are they doing that? (Suzy breathes heavily) Because your prices are high as hell you idiot. Well hello again. Yes I'm afraid I do have to make a living, but didn't Sean say something about you getting some financial help from your mother? What do I look like, an accountant? Well who does the books? And who's the math whizz? Who got a 650 on her boards? A 720. And the money, for your information, is tied up in malpractice suits, which I happen to be in the process of investigating. I see. Oh, I'm Eric by the way. Who are you? Me. Well it's nice to meet you Me. You know, I think you could be very helpful to us. Which would be a triumph for you Dr. Scanlon. A victory for Prince Scanlon, scandled for the lean clean beautiful queen. Victoria's my name. What's your lame brain saying game? That's a very difficult game Victoria, I'm not gonna lie to you. Our process is, we work together to begin to talk to each other, so that we can finally blend and become one. (Suzy sighs) You want us to ask our mother for money. I'm warning you, Ginger will never countenance that. Why not? Because that's her policy. Well could you explain that to me? Oh please, Eric. Don't be disingenuous. I'm sure you've read the same texts we have. Of all recorded cases of multiple personality, fewer than 5% have failed to demonstrate an etiology of repeated traumatic abuse. That's very good. Are you saying that your mother abused you? You're saying that. You don't remember, do you? Well what about Ginger? Does she remember? (Suzy chuckles) Well. Ginger won't talk to you. Why not? (Suzy speaking French) Well what about Bonnie? Bonnie? Do you wanna come out and play again? Of course, we could always forget to pay you, couldn't we? It's another alternative. Bonnie? Hi. It's me, Eric. Bonnie, what do you see? Who am I? Suzy. I need to talk to Suzy now. Suzy! Why are you doing this? Because sweetheart, between therapy and chauffeuring the kids, you can't be everywhere at once. Are you all right? Yeah. Listen, why don't you go lie down, and I'll make sure that Sean and the girls get their dinner. Incidentally, I sent a check to your therapist directly. Are you sure you're okay with that? Of course. It makes me feel useful now that your dad is gone. How's your therapy coming by the way? I don't know. I guess I'm finding out some stuff. Well, so long as it doesn't become a crutch. Thanks, Mom. (door slams) Lying bitch! (Suzy breathing heavily) (ominous music) Think you can hide it from me? (cars rushing by) Hey! Come on! (glass shattering) (window thudding) Okay, Mom. Let's see. Where'd she put it. Where'd you hide it Mommy? Oh, Daddy's office? Clever. (Suzy gasps) Didn't even open these. (papers falling) Claimant, Natalie Adams. (loud thud) (dogs barking) (metal scraping) (ominous music intensifies) (dogs continue barking) (Suzy gasps) That'll teach you, Natalie Adams. (phone ringing) Honey, get the phone. Ginger, I don't know about phone tag. I gotta get out of here. Good, 'cause I need you to make another run to San Diego for me. Trevor again? How much? How much do you need? Hm. Enough for a ticket to Hawaii. I'm serious hun, I'm going nuts. Yeah, you never did strike me as much of a homebody. Does this mean I'm gonna lose my best girl? (Suzy chuckles) You're breaking my heart. You're not gonna flake out on me again, are you? No, no way. This has gotta work on Dad. See ya in an hour! Bye! I'll miss you! See you tonight! I love you, I'll miss you! Come on, come on, let's get inside. Hi there, can I help you? Yes please, can I see that there? That's a pretty gun. This one? Yeah, that one there. All right. Thank you mister. Let's go home. Let's stop this. Well, let's just see. (loud country music) (bar patrons chatting) How you doing, precious? How you doing. Wanna get something to eat? Oh sure. (Suzy laughs) Hey, baby, how about a dance. How 'bout a sandwich. How about a little later. Hey stranger. Hey. You working tonight? No, I'm just looking for Trevor. He's around I don't know where he could be. So. How are your kids? Fine. How's your old man? He died. That's awful. I'm sorry. That's gotta be really tough on your kids, huh? Oh. I thought you were talking about my father, no, no my boyfriend, he's still alive. He's watching the girls. Any more at home like him? Hey, precious. You wanna go again? She's with me. Oh. Oh, I get it. Good. Good, now go on, take it somewhere else. Um, gotta get ready for my set. Do you maybe wanna go get some dinner later? Oh, yeah, maybe. I don't know if I'll have time. Bye. Hey precious. Can um, can I watch? Watch what? You and your friend. Hey Ginger. Hello Mr. Trevor. What, are you stoned? Hey, I've got money. Excuse me a second. Hold up, come on. So you got it? Got what? My product. Oh. It's safe. Wait a minute, hey, what the hell does that mean? Don't you get it? She doesn't wanna talk to you. Look, just stay out of this. No you stay out of this. Hey, stop it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Settle down boys. Stop, stop fighting! (loud punching) No, don't hurt that man! Ow! Where the hell is it? Where's my money. (Trevor breathing heavily) All right, look. Just give me whatever you've got- Good Ginger, you crazy bitch. We're out of here. (loud bar music) Hey, come back. You don't wanna mess with me, take my word for that. But, I love you. (loud kick) (man groans in pain) (tires screeching) (loud rock music) (car door slamming) (phone ringing) Suzy? D.J. Where's Suzy, I wanna talk to Suzy. I have too much to deal with right now. Hello. Sean, I think we gotta call the police. This isn't Sean, it's D.J. Oh, I must've dialed the wrong number, I'm terribly sorry. Suzy, where were you tonight? I had to lie to your mom, I had to lie to the kids. Yeah, it hurts doesn't it? Just don't make me lie to you. I wanna talk to the woman I married. She's not here! The bitch almost got us all killed. Suzy, what in the hell's going on here? Are you deaf? Suzy! (door slams) Suzy! Hello? Hello? What's going on, is somebody there? Hello? Yeah, I'm calling for Ginger. Didn't work out, the deal's off. Who's this? A friend of Ginger's. She's through with you. You listen to me, whoever you are. You tell her that I want back what belongs to me. Otherwise she's gonna disappear. You tell her that. Hello? You understand that? Hello? Hello? Suzy. Who the hell's Suzy? Suzy. What's goin on here? Suzy (phone dialing) Hey Martha, I don't know what's going on. I need you to watch the girls. (tires screeching) (dramatic music plays) Hey hun. Hey, Ginger- (dogs barking) (door slams) (Suzy knocking on door) Hello? Dr. Scanlon? Eric. Dr. Scanlon. Hello? Suzy? Don't you move, don't you move. You stay there. Sit down Eric. Okay. We haven't met, I'm Ginger. What's going on? Nothing much, just took us a little trip to San Diego. Any particular reason? Money. Well what about money? Oh, I had to make some. And how did you do that? The old-fashioned way. With a gun. With this. I see. How long you been doing that? Forever. Don't you tell Suzy. All that girl knows is how to fold laundry. She didn't even exist before those kids. We created her, not the other way around, okay? Okay. Just ask Suzy what she remembers before her kids. Well, I know what she remembers. And that's the way it's gonna stay, hm? You know, I think you'd be really surprised at how much Suzy is finding out about herself. Tell me about it. She's totally freaking out. You just lay off, or we'll all be history. What are those burns on your arm? I don't know. Well, who does? No, you stay back. You think you know about our history? You think we were molested? (frantic knocking at door) That's a load of crap! I was always in control. Is anybody in here? Always! Suzy? You stay back. Sean, please. Stay back. Stay back! It's okay. Stay there. Stay there. (Suzy crying) Honey, it's okay. No, Don't! It's okay, shh. You're hurting me, Ow! It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Shh. Hey. Hey! Suzy? You okay? What am I doing here? You had a crisis. Great. You don't remember? No. You were- there was this guy at a bar, and you threw a package to him. Then when I got to Eric's office, you were holding a gun. I don't remember. Well when are you going to remember, damn it. When you got a whole secret life going here, all these firearms and guys and bars. Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm going a little crazy here myself. How are the girls? They're fine. They asked me to give you these. Oh god. (Suzy starts crying) I'm a mess. Well you look better. Finally got some sleep. My work's been kinda nocturnal. Well how did you get into your line of work? (Suzy chuckles) My line of work? Mm hmm. Oh come on Eric, you can say it out loud. I'm a prostitute. A hooker. A beat girl. Street meat. Ho. Pro. Strawberry. Back-Alley Sally. Ginger. What do you like when it's time to charge up? What makes you hot and horny and freaky? Out with it boy, what gets you off? Suzy. Did you hear any of that? No. Suzy, what did you hear? I don't know. Do you think Ginger was lying? Yes. No. I don't know. I don't know what to do. This is important Suzy. You just heard somebody else. Oh my god. Does Sean know? Well he's starting to. He already asked me about the gun, and about some guy that you threw a package to. No, don't tell him. You can't tell him, he can't know. My life, my life. He'll leave me, he'll take my kids. He'll kill me. He'll kill me. He'll kill me. He'll kill me. (girls shouting in excitement) There you are, my babies. (loud kissing) Molly. Here they are! Welcome home there, Mommy's home. We ate oatmeal for breakfast, and we cleaned up our room. We also made a surprise for you. It's a picture of you, see? (sad slow music) Oh, it's beautiful. Tell me about it. It's a picture of you. We have an artist here. Welcome home sweetheart, welcome home. Welcome home sweetheart. Hey mom. Thanks for helping me out. It's great to have you back sweetie. It's great to be back. Can we play with Bonnie? Oh, not right now. Please, I wanna play with Bonnie. Bonnie's not feeling very well. Please, I wanna play with Bonnie, please please. Where's Bonnie gone? Come on Suzy, deal with it. Why? Nobody else is. They're afraid of the truth, are you? Okay, where'd you put it. Cold. Cold. (ominous music) (drawers shuffling) Warmer. Warmer. Come on. Warmer. (Suzy grunts) Oh. Come on. Daddy barbecued it, now you rescued it. (Suzy laughing) Claimant. Natalie Adams, you little tattletale. Tattely Natalie Adams. Come on, Suzy, it's now or never. (car door slams) (rapid knocking at door) Yes? Can I help you? Are you Natalie Adams? Yes. I'm Suzy Tremayne. Dr. Tremayne's daughter, please. Look, I'm not supposed to talk about the case with anyone, okay? Please help me. I've gotta talk to someone. Just tell me one thing. One thing, I'll go away, please. I don't care about the money. I probably shouldn't have come. No, you probably shouldn't have. Sorry. Yes, I'm sure you are. Would you like some tea? No, thank you. So what do you wanna hear about? The time I woke up in his office with my panties around my ankles? Or the time he climbed onto the examining table. Or the nightmares, maybe you'd like to hear about those. Or the injections he gave me. And asking me to come back again and again. And I went. What did I know? I was just a kid, right? He said if I didn't, he had friends who could find me anyway. He said that he had eyes in the back of his head. Thank you, thank you very much. And there's others, you know. I'm sorry, I have to go. I'm not the only one. Okay. You want their phone numbers? No, I'm fine, thank you. 'Cause I could give you their phone numbers. You know I got their phone numbers. Thank you so much. Come back and finish your dinner. You didn't eat the eyes. Now they'll always be watching you. Mom, we're home! Mom where are you, we brought you some cake! Suzy? Mom? Mom? Suzy? Suzy? Shh. Suzy, it's me. No! It's okay honey. It's me, I'm here. No! No! No! He can see me! No! No! No! Bonnie? Can I talk to Suzy please? No! Suzy. Can you hear me? (Suzy mumbling to herself) Are you Suzy? Suzy? Baby. Suzy gimme a break. (Sean and Suzy moaning) Oh Suzy. Suzy, whoa. You're really gonna do this, aren't you? What? You were supposed to be different! What are you talking about? Why don't you pay for it like all the others? Then maybe you'll be honest. (door slams) Pay? Who's talking? Oh, don't be stupid with me. What? You know where all that cash comes from. What do you think she does at those bars? You're lying. And all those little tricks that turn you on, where do you think she learned them? I wanna talk to Suzy. Think she made 'em up? I wanna talk to Suzy now! That's no half of what she knows how to do. That is only half of it. Don't touch me. Don't touch me, get away from me! Get away from me! I can't take this anymore. Sean? Sean? No, get away! I can't deal with this. I can't handle this! No! I didn't know, please don't. Please. Sean please! Please, the kids! The kids, please! Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't know! Girls. Girls! What's happening? Come on, we're getting out of here. (girls crying) I'll explain later. Don't, don't take them. Get away! Please don't leave. Mommy! Don't do this. Come on, you're scaring them, please don't do that! (girls screaming) You're scaring them, please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Come on girls, get in the car. I didn't do anything. Please, come on honey. Suzy get away from us. Come on girls, scoot over. Molly! Rosie! Get out of here! Please don't leave! Please don't leave. Please, my babies. Please don't leave. Please, don't take my babies. Sean don't leave me here. Please. My babies. Molly. (Suzy starts crying) (vacuum running) (ominous music) (engine starting) (radio playing) There we go. Thanks, Dad. Where are we going? Anywhere you'd like, sugar. Don't touch me. Besides this, Suzy. I would like that. (laughing) that's good. (both speaking inaudibly) (fire crackling) Oh my god. Daddy? Daddy, help me. Help me! Daddy. (Suzy coughing) Daddy? (phone buttons beeping) Hello? Someone tried to set us on fire. Suzy? Where are you? Where am I? I don't know. Where am I? (loud thud) (phone ringing) (dial tone) (phone ringing) Your daughter's here. She inhaled a lot of smoke, and we had to pump her stomach. Where is she? I think we should let her rest right now. She's my daughter damn it. I have to see her. I think she tried to kill herself. (car door slams) Okay guys, we're going home. Did you find Mommy? Soon. She's not here. Yeah, Dr. Scanlon? This is Sean Mitchell. Have you heard from Suzy? I can't find her and she's not at her mother's. I think I scared her, she told me some stuff. I left her home alone in the house. Could you call me as soon as you get this message? Thank you. Molly. Rosie. Suzy, thank god. Oh, where's Sean? He's okay. The kids too. You'll be fine darling. No. Won't you be fine? Suzy? Suzy? Suzy? Sean. Suzy. Okay, doctor says you can go home. Where's Sean? Did he call? No, not yet. Let's get you dressed. But what about Eric? I think I should talk to Eric. You will. Oh come on honey, let's go home. He's given up on me, hasn't he? No, no one's given up on you. But it worries me to hear you think that, honey. Come on now, let's go. Why? Because sweetheart, what happened the other night was terrible. And we're just trying to figure out why. It was terrible. I told Sean terrible things, I'm horrible. Darling, that's not true. It is true! There are others worse than me. What are you talking about? D.J. and Ginger, and others I don't even know. Oh god, I can feel them. I can feel them coming up. (Suzy crying) I don't know what else to do. I've called Martha, and I've left messages for her uncle. Yeah. Of course. All right, I'll call you. Thanks Dr. Scanlon. Daddy? Is Mommy dead? No baby, no, no. (Rosie crying) (door creaking open) Go lie down and I'll make you a cup of tea. (rapid knocking at door) Oh god. She's gonna be all right, Sean. What happened? Where is she? She's at her mother's, she's resting. She set her car on fire. But she's gonna be fine Sean. Oh my god. Molly! Rosie! Sean, wait, wait. For what? I gotta see her. No, no, not yet. Why? She doesn't wanna see me? Eventually, yes, of course. But right now she's still a little shaky. I know. I went nuts. I was afraid for the girls, I was... I should never have left her alone. Sean, no Sean. It wasn't your fault. Yes it is. Is that what that doctor's been telling you? No! I've gotta call him. No, no, Sean. I don't think she'd want you to do that. You know, she's been having second thoughts about him. We all have. Why? Because of what happened last night. It wasn't Eric's fault, it was me. I went crazy. Why did you go crazy? She told me some things. She told you? Or did one of the personalities? D.J. Ginger, Victoria, Bonnie? How can we be sure any of it was true? You don't think it is? I'm not sure. Well what about Molly and Rosie? They should see her. That's her biggest worry too, Sean. Right now she's afraid for the children to see her the way she is. Remember the first time I made this? Mm hmm. You dropped half of it on your dress? (Suzy laughs) What size piece you want, big or little? Big. I'll be right back Suzy, you wait right here. What are you doing here? Didn't Chester talk to you? We need to see her. Hi girls. (group talking and laughing) You get everything you wanted there? I'm good with the drinks. You're doing okay there, aren't you? All right, good news. You boys okay? Yeah, bring her out. Where are you sweetie? Suzy? Hey come on out now. Come on out and play Suzy. Hold on for now. Now don't you wanna come out and play? Suzy, where are you? Now don't you wanna dance for our friends? Now come on out. Yeah! Come on out Suzy. Come on Suzy. Suzy, where are you? I'm sorry Sean, please not yet. We're looking for another doctor. Just give this some time, it'll work itself out. Rosie, sweetheart. Wait a minute! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Come on, Martha. Wait a sec, just let her go. Martha, it's all right, let her go. Rosie? Rosie where are you? Mommy? Mommy don't, don't Mommy. Mommy! Mommy? Suzy, oh my god. Rosie come here. Mommy? Mommy! Get your hands off of her! No, let go! (Rosie shouting) Suzy- Suzy. Suzy! Suzy! Honey? Now do you understand? Honey. (loud knocking on door) Honey, I'm gonna call Dr. Scanlon, okay? Sean, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I don't think you should call. Well I'm calling him. Stop, this is my house damn it. What are you hiding? What are you trying to make her forget? I'm not trying to hide anything, Keeping her away from her family. She's my daughter for God's sake, I'm trying to protect her. Hello, may I speak to Dr. Scanlon please? What about your daughters? Dragging them out here, making them- What could be worse for our daughters than Suzy going crazy? Suzy killing herself. That would be worse. (loud crash) I'm not gonna hurt you. I know. Good. That's good. Oh, I knew you'd say that. You did? Why? I won over those men. Now you're next. Suzy I- And I will die first. That's what you want. Why would I want that? Because. You think I'm your dad, don't you? Messing with your head. Well he's dead. And he can't hurt you anymore. Can I talk to Suzy now? Sure. That means no, doesn't it? You're somebody new, somebody deeper. (Suzy laughs) Suzy? Victoria? Bonnie? Can any of you hear me? If you can, listen. I'm here talking to somebody who wants you dead. She thinks everything's your fault. She thinks you deserve to die, that that would solve everything. They're already dead. And you know why she thinks that? Because then at least, there would be some sense in the world. I'm bad because I hurt so much. That's what you think. But you're not bad. Something happened to you when you were little. And you were helpless. Not bad. Helpless. Let me talk to Suzy. Suzy. Suzy? Suzy, can you hear me? Am I- am I hallucinating? No. (Suzy gasps) There we go. Are you really there? Yes. After everything I've done? I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed. (Suzy sobbing) Shh. What now? Now we can begin. Mommy? Rosie. She's okay. Mommy's gonna be fine. It's okay. We're all gonna be okay. (hopeful piano music) (dramatic orchestral ending music)
