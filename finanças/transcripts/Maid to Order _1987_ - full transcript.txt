Transcript by rabbit_01 Trini, how do I look? - It's... You, Miss Jessie. - Thank you. Heavy date? I am going to a banquet for the Starlight Foundation. Alone. Unless you'd like to join me. No, thanks. I've got other plans. Daddy, what would happen if the Starlight Foundation decided to grant some old geezebag a wish, and it turned out that what he wanted was to torture and kill small animals? We don't grant old geezebags wishes, Jess. We try to help people who deserve it, like children who need it. - Dad, please! I'm zeroed out! - I gave you two hundred. - Well, it's ancient history. - I believe it was lunchtime. - I'll make do with a fifty. - No! - Is that fair? - Yes. - Woodrow! - Oh Lord! Woodrow! My best friend... my buddy! Listen. Daddy stiffed me again and I was wondering if you could see your way clear to... - Great! - I love you too. Thanks man. I'll get it back to you tomorrow. Brett! Hey! Hey babe. I have a present for you! It's the Beaujolais Nouveau. Catch! Woops! Don't worry. I have a case. - Jessie, this is the last time, I swear. - Yeah, I know. You always say that. Well, this time I mean it. Are you out of your mind? Jessie, that's not funny! - Touchy! - Touchy! You could've killed us. I know, you're so cute! Yoo hoo! Waiter! Another bottle of champagne! - Who's paying for all this? - Don't you just love Jessie? I just met her and I already do. Jessie, cut it out! Jessie, Jessie... just stop it. I love you. You said the same thing to the lead guitarist, you know. - Did I? - Yes. You did. Jessie, cut it out. Some of us have to work tomorrrow! Okay? - It's four a.m.! - Can you stay? No! It is over! Really over. Read my lips: we are finished! - Just for that, I'm keeping the Beaujolais. - Try not to drink it all tonight. What an asshole! - Good morning, Mr. Montgomery, sir. - Good morning. I'm afraid I have a problem. It happened again. I loaned her some money. - How much? - Fifty dollars. Thank you very much, Mr. Montgomery. I'm sure Jessie'll straighten out. - Mr. Montgomery, I'm so sorry. - That's alright, Trini. Go and wake Jess and tell her to get downstairs right away. - Nine hundred and eight dollars? - I can explain it. Alright. Go ahead. Daddy, there were ten poor people. I met them in the street. I took them dancing. Boy, I thought if I gave you everything you wanted, it might make up for your mother's death. But I succeeded in spoiling you. Daddy, is it true Aunt Mildred's a lesbian? - You are completely lacking in character. - Yes, I know. I'm sorry. - No you're not. - No, I am! I am. - Let's make up, shall we? - It's not going to work this time, Jess. You have to make something of yourself. You're not a kid anymore. I'm very disappointed in you. Join the club. I'm bored! - Yeah? - May I see some identification, please? Woops. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. - Hands please. - What? No, Officer, you're making a big mistake. See, I'm rich! Would you mind not doing that? I'm kinda bummed and I have a headache. - What are you in for? - I don't remember. Figures. Oh, my poor father! When this hits the papers... He's a philanthropist. Is he servin' time too? No. A philanthropist is... never mind. - So what are you in for? - Jaywalking. I'm sorry, Mr. Montgomery. For what it's worth, I think that deep down... ... way deep down, she's a good girl. I never thought I'd hear myself say something like this, Woodrow. I wish I'd never had a daughter. Another day, another damsel in distress. You're outta here. Rise and shine, doll. - Who are you? - I'm your fairy godmother. The nightmare continues. Look, I didn't ask for this job, okay? Let's just make the best of it. I haven't worked in ages. Literally. They wake me up this morning, they say there's a problem in Los Angeles, and you're it. Are you from a drug rehabilitation program? Close. At least you can tell me where we're going. You're getting out. The charges have been dropped. They have? I knew it! Tell me, what? Did Daddy grease a few palms? Not exactly. Hey. Where's my money? Where're my credit cards? What's happening? - I bruise easily, okay? - You're a real peach, aren't ya? Okay. There's good news and bad news. - Which do you want first? - The good news. The good news is you have no criminal record. Last night didn't happened. Fabulous. And the bad news? - Neither did the night before that. - I don't like this. I wanna see my father. Oh, you can't, you can't, you can't. Well, that is, you can see him, but he won't be your father. What do you mean, he won't be my father? What I'm trying to tell you is that, as of five minutes ago, the old Jessie Montgomery ceased to exist. You're the same person and yet... you never were. - Where are my credit cards? - You have no money. You have no past, you have no family, no friends. You're, ah... you're on your own now. I don't know who you are, but you are a major wacko. My dad is gonna fix this. I'm outta here. I'm history. Precisely. Well, good luck! You're gonna need it. Damn it! This is an absolute nightmare. A nice hot bath, that's what I need! - Trini, it's me, open the door. - And who are you? - It's Jessie! Open the door! - I don't know any Jessie. God damn it! Daddy! Daddy, I'm so glad to see you! Listen, I can explain everything. - Do you have any idea who this girl is? - Excuse me. I think you made a mistake. Yes, I know I made a mistake. I made a lot of mistakes. And I'm sorry for all of them, daddy! - Look, I'm tryin' to be nice. - See what she wants. - Would you leave Mr. Montgomery alone. - Hey! - Be on your way! - Woodrow, man. Come on! Alright, look it's a great joke. It's really funny. I've learned my lesson. Daddy, I said I was sorry, dammit. What, d'you want it in writing? I'm hyperventilating! Jimmy! Jimmy? Jimmy! Alright, Jimmy, Jimmy stay! Stay, Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Remember puppy lessons! I've got to get out of here! - Freeze! - Don't shoot! Hold it right there! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Halt! Immediately! Hold it, right there! Kimmy! Who in the hell is that? I don't know. I've never seen her before in my life. Kimmy! Oh my God! Oh, thank God! Kimmy, you're not going to believe what I've been through! Listen, can you advance me some bucks? My dad is sorta pissed off at me, and I'm kinda in deep shit... - which is why I look so trashed out... - Hey! Get out of my car! What is your problem? Kimmy! Unbelievable! What nerve! Watch the paint, sister! - Kimmy! - She scratched my car! Hello? Daddy, I know you're really angry with me and it's understandable. But I have to tell you, I think this has been a very cruel joke. - Are you listening? - Young lady, I don't have a daughter. Hey, Jimmy. What've you got here? Must belong to that poor girl. I wonder who she is. Hi! You look terrible.You really shouldn't let yourself go like this, Jess. Who or what are you? You're a slow learner, aren't you kid? Have you got a... damn! - You're a witch! - I'm perfectly harmless. - That's what they said about asbestos! - Jessica, I have to tell you something. Youre a spoiled, silly, boring, insignificant little twit. Hey. Who are you calling boring? Some fairy godmother you are! I thought you guys were supposed to turn maids into princesses and shit like that. Some maids deserve to be princesses. But some princesses deserve to be maids. Oops. I'm getting ahead of myself. Hey! Where are you going? Wait up! What did you do to my father anyway? - Voodoo? - He's under a spell. - Is it a permanent situation? - It is unless you clean up your act. - Hey. My act is clean. - Look at the life you live! You don't even have the sense to feel guilty. Guilty? You want me to feel guilty? Look,you just turned my life into a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. Okay, I mean I am bummed! No, I'm not! No, I'm guilty! I am! I'm really guilty. Please, wait. Help me! I don't want to be poor, I don't want to be boring. I don't want to be alone. Help me, fairy godmother, please! Please. I've gotta stop with these cigarettes. It's the strain of this job. Where were we? I think we're at "help me, fairy godmother, please." Right. Okay. Now, first of all, call me Stella. I really hate the fancy titles. - Stella? - You got a problem with that? - No! I love it. - Okay. Next, get a job. - Then we'll talk. - A job? What kind of job? I mean, what kind of job, fairy godmother? Help me! Stella! Stella, wait! Wait! Stella! Stella! Oh God! Stella, don't leave me alone like this! Hey! Sweetheart, there is no such thing as a white maid in Los Angeles. Bonus? How much would that be? You are kidding me! Would you take a light skinned Chicana? Very light! No, she can not learn English by five o'clock. Okay, okay. Just give me one hour before you call anybody else. I gotta get back to you, Louise. - What can I do for you? - I'm looking for a donut... - I mean... a job. - Take a load off, honey. - I've never done this sort of thing before. - What kind of thing? Work. Well, we're not exactly talking brain surgery here. No, of course not. I faint at the sight of blood. Yeah. Why don't we start at the basics. Name? - Jessica Montgomery. - Okay. Address and phone? Well, I'm sort of between addresses right now. I get the picture. You need something quick, preferably live-in. I just happen to have a position in one of the most beautiful mansions in Malibu. - What do I have to do? - Nothing too taxing. There's a full staff. A cook, chauffer... Sounds perfect. When do I start? - Today. You'll need a uniform. - A uniform? - Size ten, right? - No. I think there's been some mistake. Wait a second. Can we talk about this? There's nothing to talk about. I did not spend six years in junior college to be a maid. Lubrication... systems. Lubrication... Oil pump... drain plug... Ah! That's the baby. Drain plug. Okay, I can handle that. No problem. Goddam oil leak! Unbelievable! What a life! Okay. Mr drain plug. Prepare to die, you little sucker. Ah, No! Dammit! Unbelievable! Come on! Gimme a break. Are you alright? - No problem. - Well, as long as you're alright... I hope I'm better than alright. Can I help you? No, you can't help me. I have a meeting. Excuse me. The servants' entrance is right around this way. Hello. Excuse me ! Excuse me. Pardon! Pardonnez! Lolos siento muchas dondes esta... Sorry. Darn piece of junk! I paid thirty bucks for this. Who are you? The nurse? I think I'm the new maid. Mrs. Starkey? Oh, Maria, I want you to take these little soap slivers, run 'em under hot water. Mash 'em into a lump... and voila. New soap for the servants' quarters. Now, everybody uses the downstairs bathroom, so, I think we should use the best soap in there. Now, in case they go upstairs, I think maybe we should put... George Sanq, maybe the Plaza. Thank you. Okay. This is Jessie Montgomery, from Celebrity. Come in. I understand that you used to work for the countess Pagozzi. I did? I did. I did. I worked for the countess Lozzly for ages. - She moved here in March. - But we became close so quickly. - Such a shame about her death. Tragic. - Yeah. Yes. - Especially in one so young? - She was ninety three. - At heart. She was young at heart. - Yes, young at heart. Well, I'll try you for one week. Six days, Sundays off. Hundred and forty dollars. Now go find Maria and she'll show you to your room. One forty! - What's she like? - She's white. - Over sixty five? - Under twenty five. And pretty. - You got the job. - Pinch me I must be dreaming. This is Audrey, our cook. This is Jessie Montgomery. - I'm charmed I'm sure. - What kind of cooking do you do? - California, Nouvelle, Cordon bleu? - Home. - Airball. - Why don't you go check your room. Third door on the left. Down that hall. - Hope you'll be real happy here. - Later! I give her twenty four hours, tops. Sunny, I know how you feel and I'm trying to do my best. I swear it! It just isn't happening. Of course I wanted to get you that concert spot. Didn't happen. Oh, while I got you on the phone... You know those two weeks in Vegas? Didn't happen. No. Nothing's happening, Sunny. I'm sorry. I busted my ass to try and get it for you. Hey, it's about time you started living in the real world, as well as the possible. You want other representation? You got it! Hah! Are you kidding? Yeah, I know you're only kidding. Okay. It's just, Sunny, after all these years, I don't like you walking on me with those 'fuck you' shoes, okay? 'Course I love you. Bye. He's dead. He just isn't happening. You have to concentrate on the new people, Stan. What new people? All the good ones, like Sting and Madonna, The Boss - they have representation. - I like that group Loaded Blanks. - I don't... After I couldn't get them that "We are the World" gig, it's not happening. Theat lead singer, Dude, star material. - Maybe, with the proper exposure. - Well, you can do that. Sure! How? How 'bout a charity gig? That's it! A charity gig! That's the big thing with selling talent today! A charity gig. - Now 'bout Africa? - It's been done. - Been done. How 'bout the seals? - Done. - Save the whales? - Done. Save something! There's gotta be something in America. Moose! Sheep! Something! Baby, can you help me? Can you think of something? Come on. Something with class. Moi? That's my pussycat! I love ya! I'm gonna go workout now. And I'll be right back. Not bad, huh? Another two weeks, I won't even need these. Is Maria Mexican? She's from El Salvador. She's been here nine years. Put another piece in your mouth, and I'm coming after it. - Have you always been a cook? - Used to be a singer. Then I had that elbow trouble, ended my career. - What kind of elbow trouble? - I bent it too much. Lorelei, Brie... either of you know a band called Loaded Blanks? Sure. What do you think of the lead singer, Dude? - He's crazy. - No, he isn't. A lot of people confuse enthusiasm with craziness. He's a major wacko. He throws raw meat at the audience. Well, I think he's gonna be a big star. - What do you say makes a star, Stan? - Pressure. Being able to cope with pressure. Wayne understands that. So does Pia. Do you know that Wayne is a real human being? That's because he does everything his way. I thought Frank Sinatra did it his way. Yeah, Frank Sinatra does it his way, too, but, ah... Wayne does it his way, too... Those are nasty bandages, Mr. Starkey! Were you in an accident? - Who is this? - That's the new maid. - Get rid of her. - Mr. Starkey, I just started! I said get rid of her! But Stan, she's white! - I can't believe it, he fired me! - In under an hour? I was way off. What did you do? - I asked him about the bandage. - Bad move. - Why? What happened to him? - Hair transplant. Your father knows so many famous people. And your mother is so... so stylish! They're both jerks. The more I think about this charity gig, the better I like it. It's a great idea, Stan. Yeah. Every mover and shaker in Hollywood comes to these things. I bet I could net Dude an album, and maybe a three picture deal. Here baby. Come on. It's from Europe. Mr. Starkey, Steve on line 5, Edie on 6. - Oh, they're fighting again. - Thanks, Nick. Hey, have you had a chance to listen to my tape yet? Working on it, kid. - Well, it's been three months. - Just a question of time. Well what should I do? Should I grovel? Should I beg? If you've got no place to go, you better be ready to kiss ass and suck toes. Oh, Mrs. Starkey, I'm so sorry, I had no idea! Never open your mouth unless someone asks you a question. - But Mrs. Starkey, I-I... - Did I ask you a question? No. Now, I have had a long conversation with Mr Starkey and, because of your exceptional qualifications, I have convinced him to give you one more chance. The tin foil! Get over here. I can't believe you did that. Big piece! Look at all this! Look. This is a huge piece! Huge! I mean, do I have to take care of all the details around here? What does she do with the tin foil? She sells it and gets ten cents a pound. This woman needs professional help. Well, I'm trashed out, I'm crashing. Not yet you aren't. I'm the cook. You're the maid. You clean up. Your kidding. - Jessie, open the door! Get out here! - Jesus Christ! What is this, a fire drill? What is your problem? It's seven o'clock in the morning! What exactly did you put in my dishwasher? Why do you ask? Tide? Oh no. Stop! Dammit! No! Hold... hold it! Hold it. What have you done to my wrinkled suit? I pressed it. I know, but you're not supposed to press it. It's a wrinkled suit. I bought it wrinkled. It's a Giorgio Armano wrinkled. Wrinkles are in! It's the '80s, kiddo. Wake up! I can't believe this! My Giorgio Armano! Pressed! Jessie, I'll kill you! - Maria. - What is it? Can I borrow some jeans and a t-shirt? I want to wash my uniform and I don't have anything to wear. Thanks. How are you doing this morning? I think I got off on the wrong foot with Maria. - No shit, Sherlock. - I don't know how to talk to maids. I know how you feel. Why'nt try to move into my neighborhood. Audrey, can you show me how to use the washing machine? What are you, anyway? Some kind of reporter or something? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Try me. I grew up in Beverly Hills, in a house as big as this one. I was rich. Then one day, my fairy godmother appeared. and poof... she took it all away. Right. Come on, I don't want to end up with a cascade in my Maytag. - What're you doing here? - I swim here every night. - Well, back off! - Alright. - Where are you going? - I'm getting out. I don't usually swim naked with women I don't know. - I'm Jessie Montgomery. - Nick McGuire. - You're the new maid. - No. I'm not a maid. - Not really. - So I heard. - So you're the chauffer? - And the mechanic. - Actually, I'm not really a mechanic. - Yes, so I heard. - No! - No, what? You don't have any clothes on. - So? - So. So? - So, what're we gonna do? - I'll tell you what. Let's shoot for it. Odds, I go out first. Evens, you go out first. On four, right? - 1, 2... - You go out first! Okay. Okay. Jessie! I really like this floor to shine, I mean really shine. Now to get it clean, completely clean, it is necessary to get down on your hands and knees, and scrub every little square inch by hand. No mop. Any questions? - When's lunch? - There is no lunch until the work is done. You know Oscar, there is a certain satisfaction in a job well done. Marvellous ride! Simply marvellous! Oh, you're kidding. Oh, God. Where is it... I want to go home! - Charles Montgomery and Miss Winston. - Right this way, please. Daddy! Mr. Starkey, the people from the Starlight Foundation are here. - Hi. Stanley Starkey here. - Charles Montgomery. - Stella Winston, Starlight Foundation. - Georgette. - Hello. - Hello, Georgette. How are you? - Well, come. Sit down, pick a couch. - Oh, thank you, after you. Anyway. From Europe. Okay. Sit. Well. Your house is... remarkable. Well, I had a decorator, but I helped. Chuck? I suppose you're wondering why we asked you two over. It's Charles and, yes, the thought did pass my mind. Well you see Chuck, as you can see, Georgette and I have been blessed. And, well, we feel a little guilty. I mean, there are children in China who are starving, and here we are. It's uncomfortable. We haven't even been to a chinese restaurant in over a month. - You know what I mean? - What I think Stan is trying to say is that, well, being of a certain social and financial level of the community umm, we'd like to share some of what we have with others. So you thought of the Starlight foundation? Bingo! - Please let me take it in Maria, please! - She told me to do it. What difference does it make? The difference is, if you screw up, my ass is grass. And she's the lawnmower. I won't screw up. I promise. As you may or may not know, the Starlight Foundation has granted over two thousand wishes to sick children. That's sweet. Listen: I handle a lot of big names. There's a new group - Loaded Blanks. They have a lead singer, Dude. He is happening. Very happening. We can arrange a benefit for the Foundation, featuring Dude, and hold the dam thing right here in our own home. - Wieney? - Ah. No. Thanks. - What kind of fee would that involve? - No fee. The talent will perform free of charge. There'll be no financial gain for Starkey Management. - We just love charity. - Yes, it's second nature to us. So if you could give us the say-so to use Starlight Foundation... For the benefit of Starlight Foundation. Right. You! Oh. Ah. You'll have to excuse Jessie. She's part of a reverse affirmative action program. I think I should put some water on this. Could you tell me where the, ah... Second door on the left. So difficult to find good white help these days. Oh! You must try this mustard. It's from Spain, very hot. So, did you move into my house now, too? - Quiet, Jessie! - Some fairy godmother you are! You're more like a wicked step-mother who brain-washed him. I have done no such thing. I don't make the wishes. I just carry them out. - What're you talking about? - I follow orders. His wish was granted. It's as simple as that. You're talking nonsense again! I don't believe in you, there's no magic! This is some elaborate setup you came up with to get me out of the picture, so you could get your hands on his money. My money! Where I come from, we don't use money. We don't use people, either. You're wrong, Jessie. There is magic. Prove it. You told me to get a job. I got one, now send me home. I can't. You haven't earned it. I've cleaned this house from top to bottom. Big deal! You're even lousy at that. Has anyone ever told you, that a job worth doing is worth doing well? I can see you haven't spent much time as a washroom attendant. - You're hopeless. - And you're no Easter basket yourself. I'm trying to help you, Jessie! Some help you are! Look, I wish you'd just cast your broomstick right out of my life out of my life. Careful, careful now. I can grant that wish. - Go ahead. - Alright. If that's what you really want, I'm not your fairy godmother anymore. - You'll never see me again. - Good. - You're on your own. - My heart is broken. We'll have to keep a tight reign on revenues and expenditures, you understand. - Oh, I can do that. - She's very good at math. Oh, that's fine. Takes care of it. Stella, can I drop you somewhere? - Yes, please. - Mr. Montgomery! Mr. Montgomery! What's the matter with that girl, is she choking on something? Let's hope it's her pride. - I beg your pardon? - Nothing, Charles. C'mon, let's boogie. Well shouldn't we... No, no, she's fine. She just hates to see company leave. Does it every time. Whenever the guests leave. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Have a nice trip. Drive careful. - Carefully. Jessie, what is your problem? I don't like charades, and certainly not with the help. Are you studying mime, dear? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - What strange behavior. - Daddy's gone away! Come back! Come back! Come back! Oh god, he's gone! I think I just made the biggest mistake of my life! Actually, I think the evening went very well, don't you? I think so too. They seem like a very nice couple. Oh, but she has no taste in dressing, at all. I know. And his clothes, those three button vests! - It's definitely not today's man. - Maybe we can help them. I think so. He needs a little more shoulder. Jessie? Looks like little Miss Thing will soon be history. I think little Miss Thing probably broke a fingernail. Thank you. You said one forty. Well, I had to take thirty dollars off for the curtains and fifty for the vacuum cleaner. Didn't I? - Here. - No, it's okay. I can manage. No, it's okay. You can pay me back next week. It's alright. Okay, a hundred pounds. That's five bucks. Okay! Hurry. Come, come. Oh, look at you! Come on, Nick, we'll be late for the plane. Brie! Shake it! Nick, just think! Five dollars this month! I hate Las Vegas. - I don't think she has anyhere to go. - It's no wonder. - I'm asking her. - If she's coming, I'm not. She ruined my whole week. I'm not letting her ruin my day off. Listen, on Sunday, we have a big dinner at my house. If you're not too busy, I thought maybe you'd like... No, thanks. I have other plans. Well, I left instructions on how to get to my house, on the dresser. - If case you change your mind.

And this is Janine, my oldest. And Tiffany. My boy, Jomo. - This is for you. - Thank you, Jessie. Look at that... Just what I need. A Walkman. No... yours is the other one. I'm sorry, Maria... - You didn't have to do this. - Yeah, I did. We're glad you could make it, Jessie. Anyone's welcome who can peel a potato. Don't worry. I'll talk you through it. - It's delicious. - Thank you. Pass the gravy. Mr James, Audrey says she... Everybody calls me Slide, Jessie. Oh. Slide, Audrey says she used to be a singer. One of the best. She started singing in the church. Anything Audrey put her voice to came out sweet as honey. Now you got him started, you gonna regret it. She had everything. The looks, the moves, the talent. No-one cared what you did yesterday, all they care about is what you doing today. And today it's time to do the dishes. Maybe we should talk about something else. - Why don't you add some ice cream to it? - It's better this way. Hey wait a minute. That's mine! I don't want chocolate... It's not yours! - Janine, we've got to go. - Now? - Now you take good care of my baby. - I will, momma. - What'd you hear about the tuition at UFC? - They went up again. Well, I'll try to think of something on the way home. Good-bye daddy. I love you! You kids walk your mother to the car. - Good night, Slide. Thank you. - Good night. It's a pleasure. Jessie, I want to show you something. - Audrey? - Yeah. The fat one. She's lost a little weight since then. Lead singer. Don't you tell her I showed you. I'm taking my life in my own hands. Well, I wanted you to know that the woman you're working with once really was somebody. She still is. Good-bye ! Nick always picks us up on Sundays. The bus ride takes two hours. - How was it? - I missed you baby. Next time. What you doing? Where's Audrey? Um. She's sleeping in. I want you to try something. Here. - How is it? - Good. Really? - GHey. You're Dude, right? - Yeah, that's right. Caught your show at the Roxy last month. I almost got hit by some meat. Where's Starkey? And who are you? Downstairs. I'm Nick. I'm the chauffeur. Actually, I write songs. As a matter of fact, I got this ballad. It's got a real hooky chorus, bridge that won't... Look man, I'm not into submissions, alright. If I let you give me something, my lawyers have to stamp it and send it back, with a letter that says I never heard it anyway. See? - Right. - Dude! Good hair, baby. - Dude, cut the fear. - Hi, Dude! - So how's the gig shaping up? - Sterling's coming. - Capitol Records Sterling? - And that's just the beginning! We've got the heads of four studios, actors, agents. It's gonna be something really big. Forget about Africa! Forget about Ethiopia and the seals, hah! We got the Starlight Foundation, my boy! And you are going to be the Cabbage Patch Doll of rock'n'roll! It makes me feel real good doing something for others, you know? - Especially when it helps my career. - Rock and roll! Dude, It's so nice to see somebody who knows how to dress for a change. Now tell me, where do you shop? - Jessie, can I help? - It's all done. What's the matter with you anyway? You been born again? Anyone can change. That was pretty. What was it? - I was just fooling around. - Play me something you wrote. - No. - Why not? - You're not interested. - Says who? - Do you know any of Audrey's old songs? - Sure. You remember this. Hey Audrey. Come on in. Sing something for Jessie. Look, I'm the cook, guys. I drive cars, she cleans floors. Who cares? You're never gonna get a classier audience than this one, right here. Okay, you put your ass on the line, McGuire! - Alright. - Let's do one of yours. - Which one? - The good one. - B-flat? - Is there any other key? ♪ I've loved good and I've loved hard ♪ ♪ Better days I've never seen ♪ ♪ I've made some wrong and some right moves ♪ ♪ You know what I mean ♪ ♪ just like you, I've been waiting ♪ ♪ for the right one to come through ♪ ♪ Love is hard to find ♪ ♪ And, though I've been hurt some time ♪ ♪ I can still shine ♪ ♪ I can still shine ♪ ♪ Yesterdays mistakes are all in the past ♪ ♪ I was living too fast ♪ ♪ Sometimes I fell, and no-one cared ♪ ♪ But who said life was fair? ♪ ♪ So, when things get rough ♪ ♪ I find piece of mind, I give it one more try ♪ ♪ And I shine! ♪ ♪ I can still shine ♪ ♪ I can still, you know it ♪ ♪ I've got it, you know it ♪ ♪ I can still shine ♪ ♪ Like the sun in the morning ♪ ♪ I'm gonna, I'm gonna shine ♪ ♪ I can still shine ♪ That was great! Wow! - I think it's time to say good night, Maria. - "Good Night, Maria." - So you want to go for a drive? - Yeah. - You're not from LA, are you? - Buffalo. What about you? I don't want to talk about it. It's... very strange. Yeah, my family's pretty weird too. - What's your real story? - I'm an heiress. No, actually, this is the only job I could get. Come on! - No, I'm not good for much. Really. - I think you're wonderful. So where're you taking me? Out for the best meal of your entire life. My friend, good luck! Did you know there a more tortillas made every day in Los Angeles than in all of Mexico? No, I didn't know that. Do you want to hear the complete history of the tortilla? Sure. Well? It's the best meal of my entire life. We have the individual napkin rings with a single rose and the black urns with tropical flowers. But those black urns are two hundred dollars apiece! For quality, you pay, Mrs. Starkey. Yes, but you see, every dollar that we spend, that's one less dollar for Starlight Foundation. Now as much as I would love for everybody to think what beautiful work you do, I'm afraid we'll have to stick with the carnations. I have my reputation to consider. If someone dies, I will handle carnations. Funerals only for carnations. Well, however. If you could see your way into donating the urns, I'll bet you I could get your name on the invitation. See if they'll wait another couple of weeks. Well, why won't they? Janine, I'm doing everything I can. Stall, honey. And go talk to the lady in financial aid again. - Right, honey? Bye. - Janine's tuition? - Yeah. - I got a couple hundred saved up. That's real sweet, Jessie, but I need at least ten thousand. Stan, are you sure I shouldn't put a bow in my hair? No, no no, it's fine. Remember, less is more. Besides, it's only a wiener roast. Yeah, but it'd add a little color... No, no no, remember they said the dress is casual. It's casual. There's no sense in gilding the lily, baby. The last thing we want to do is attract too much attention. We're going to a movie. Do you want to come? No. But thanks anyway. What about you, Nick? No, I think I'll just curl up with a book or something. Flowers? What a twit! Relax. You're very tense. I'll just be glad when this Starlight thing is over with. You did an incredible job, Georgette. I don't know what I'd do without you. I don't deserve to cut your toenails. Although it was the highlight of my breakfast. Here we are, Mr. Montgomery. You have a nice time. See you in a couple of hours. - The keys, please. I'll park it. - No, no sugar. I'll keep these. Georgette! Those three over there? Harvey Bestman from Universal, George Serling - Capital Records and Alicia Nolan from CAA. Those three can make or break Dude and I overnight. Shall we? Hello. - Harvey. - Stan. Alicia. George. I'm Stan Starkey. And this is my wife, Georgette. You're going to have wonderful entertainment tonight, thanks to Starlight Foundation. Yes, well I certainly hope it's better than the last time I saw Loaded Blanks. They threw raw meat at the audience, you know. You're kidding. Oh, that's right. You are a vegetarian, aren't you? Did he say 'meat, raw meat'? Of course, the entertainment's just the icing on the cake. We're here for the Starlight Foundation. Raw meat... - Well. What do you suggest? - Excuse me? - The shrimp or caviar? - They're both good, Mr. Montgomery. Now you're the... I'm sorry, I don't remember your name. - Jessica. - Jessica. - Charles! - Stella! - How's it going? - I can't complain. Looks like a great night for Starlight Foundation. I have to admit, that Tuesday board meeting was a bit of a snooze. Well, shall we, er, mingle? Well. Thanks. - Isn't it beautiful? - When does the music start? Soon, I hope. - Are you okay? - Yeah. What is Starlight Foundation anyway? It's a charity that grant children's wishes. - Maybe I could apply. - What do you want? Oh, nothing, I make enough here to send money to my family in El Salvador. I'm okay. Yeah, but if you could have one wish. What would you wish for? Somebody to clean the kitchen after the party. - No. I'm serious. - So am I. - What about you, Audrey? - Janine's tuition. - What about you? What would you wish for? - Well, right now I guess... ... I wish I could get all these people to listen to my music. - What about you? - I'd wish... I wish that all your wishes come true. Okay, okay. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen... We have a show that's about to start... Unbelievable show! We've got one of the greatest... Excuse me one second please. Dude. Where is Dude? No, no luv. You don't understand, I am an artist, a pioneer, a rebel. I'm changing the face of music as we know it. I guess you could say I'm the Jesse James of rock'n'roll... Put him down here. Easy, easy. What happened? He was telling me how he's the Jesse James of rock'n'roll. And then, right in the middle of a sentence, bump, a coconut fell on his head. A coconut fell on his head? - Can you believe this mess? - It's going to take a week to clean it. Audrey, my father needs help, quick. There's something wrong with Dude. Come On, Dude! Good boy! Come on, Dude. Wake up! Come on, boy! Come on boy. I said get up! What the hell's he got on board? Animal tranks? No man. It's not drugs. He got hit by a coconut. Dude, Dude. Wake up Dude! Come on! You crazy, stinkin'... Wake up! - Dude, Dude. Are you alright? - Dude? Who's Dude? - I'm Irwin Razelhoff. - He's got amnesia! No. He is Irwin Razelhoff. At least he was, before he was Dude. Listen to me. There are four hundred people out there, come to see you. - Do you remember the words to the songs? - What songs? - Somebody call a doctor! - No, No! We don't have time! Hey! You guys! You guys gotta go on without him. Hey, Dude's the singer, man. We're just the backup band. Backup band? Mr. Starkey, Audrey can sing. - Audrey? Who's Audrey? - Hold on a second! Hey! You're Audrey James. I grew up on your music. You're Audrey James? Sorry for the delay ladies and gentlemen, but there's been a slight change in the program. I know how you feel.

I'm very proud of you. It's a wonderful night for the Foundation. Listen. I been meaning to talk to you about that. There's been a slight error in the figures. We spent a hundred dollars a head, not two. which means, with our personal donation, there'll be another forty thousand dollars for the Starlight Foundation. - Right baby? - That's wonderful. Thanks. It's the least we can do. Excuse me for a minute. Your husband's a lucky man. Good night. First thing Monday morning we start working on the record contract. Miss James, I want to give you my personal check. As a bond between us tonight. From now on you'll be working for Capital. Capital Records? Great! You're both going to be very big. Very big. - See you Monday. - Thank you. Ten thousand dollars! - Let me see. - Isn't it great?

Just fabulous. Let's do lunch. - Fantastic, call me. - Sushi. Gotcha! Stan, why don't we have lunch on Monday. Lunch on Monday, Monday Monday... I'm busy Monday. But call me in about a week.

Come on, Jess. Alright, but only if you promise you won't do anything funny like turn me into a frog. I have to get moving on. I have to go to some place called Grand Rapids, Michigan. - I hate the cold. - So am I your first failure? - I wouldn't say that. - Did you enjoy the party, Miss Montgomery? - Woodrow? - Yeah. You know me? Know you? I've been knowing you since you was that high, girl. Can I have your ticket, please? Jessie. Honey, I'm a little tired. I'm gonna go home now. If you want to stay, I'll have Woodrow come back with the car. - Car? - Take you home. - Home? - Home. - Daddy, I love you so much! - I love you too, sugar. And listen, don't stay up too late, alright? And if that attractive friend of yours is single, bring her by for dinner, okay? Okay. I can't keep up with your outfits, honey. Good night. Good night, daddy. Stella, you're not gonna want my first born child, or anything like that, are you? Don't be absurd! We don't do that! Anymore. For everything. Thanks. Don't get mushy. Thanks. Good night. - Will I ever see you again? - Not if you play your cards right. I sort of thought you were gonna go off in a bubble or something like that. Get real! This is the twentieth century.
