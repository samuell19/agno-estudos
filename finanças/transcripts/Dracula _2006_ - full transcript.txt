I sought that person would have to be experienced? but it is not experienced. He withdraws every time I touch him. It has a violence in it when I come near. It is as soon as are the things?

I want to live a full life with him, Mina, but how I make it. I need this. I do not want to live intouched. Is Jonathan experienced? I don't know. Did he touched you? - Yes. - Mina?

He was in busines in Balkan for as two months. She was expecting him back. Why didn't he dock in Whitby? She doesn't know. She is beside her self with worry. Please, do it to find him. All mens of that ship are died, Lucy. Do this one thing for me, Arthur. Mina? Jonathan? Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Oh, I'm sorry. Can I help you? I'm sorry. I thought? What is it?

Those that had invited it here? Their bodies are upstairs. Who? Who? You must get away from here before he comes back. Is night, he is hunting, but he will return. What's happened here? Tell me what's happened. Is Holmwood misstreted you? Holmwood? Who is Holmwood? You must take caire! You must get me away from here. I will take care of you, but I have to know everything. Yes, all starts. The first lesson that the man learned it was that the tree of the wisdom kills? e exactly thus, years later, still we desire its fruit? we still have to know everything. How much time have been here? They treat me like an animal because I know excessively. What is your name? Your name? My name is Abraham. Abraham Van Helsing. - She is a woman. - Yes. Then, she can not know this. You must protect her? you must take avay for this now. I told everithing to Mr. Harker. - Tell him what you told me. - She is a woman! These men? Singleton, Cotford, and this Holmwood lord of who had spoken? he must be who finances them? they have a society? they are members of the Brotherhood of Dead-Living creature. Of course, I wanted to know the truth of their religion? then, they had puted in charge to me? my life was dedicated to study the religion daily pay-Christian? to investigate the popular stories? the superstition of Vampire? wich is oldest and most powerful? And so..., I travelled to Transilvania. The Vampire exists, Van Helsing was its prisoner. But he was protected by his cross. - John? - This is what he says. The Vampire finishes freeing? with instructions of the Brotherhood? he comes for England with invitation? but with some conditions. He wants properties both. He covered to London. The Brotherhood saw what happened with Van Helsing? and had been scared to go back to Transilvania. Then, they had contracted an innocent stops to detail the properties pra it. E the Vampire travels back to England in to the Demeter? under the innocent's name. This is what he says. John, this man is ill, he needs help! I found him in the bilge of a house that has a black altar! Holmwood adores in that house! He is not a man of a private society, John! - These things do not exist. - I can assure to it, madame? even now, this night? there are people meeting in this city? trying to find new answers for old questions? searching its headquarters for knowledge. The old died are raising. I want you to stay, trust in Christ. I found that they were only whims of the intellectuals? games of hall for the unsatisfied ones, but I saw? I saw spirits, i saw metamorphoses? - I saw deads walk. - No. Mina, Van Helsing believe that the Vampire was in Whitby? and attacked Lucy. That perhaps Holmwood offered him as a sacrifice. - What did he say to you? - Go away! Go... away! Go away! Lucy's marriage was unconsummated, Dr. Seward. That was her exyity with her marriage. Nothing more. What are you doing? I try catching loaned pra to go back to Holland. I pay to him to return. - No, you must stay and help. - No, we are not in safe! This Vampire got back in London he will go to start, slowly? to spread his plague. But before, he began he will go to kill all those that they know? that he is here. We aren't in safe! Arthur, wake up. I found a house in Chelsea. Singleton and his man are died. You murdered Lucy, didn't you? - No. - You kept it virgin? because you fuites value purety above all life. She was a gift for this Dracula, wasn't she? I didn't want him to die. I wanted to live a life with her! Then, why become involved with devolists and atheists like Singleton? They had kept the true who they really were, John. And I was despaired! If madness and deseases they were its destination? you would not look for in the entire world a way to deceive the death? I only wanted Lucy? but if I had expressed my love physically? it would have died of s?filis. She is in the God's hands. What do you go to do? This creature covers London. He wants to be the spider in the center of the wed of empire? spreading his plague over the world, telling as for his own kind. In the name of Jesus, we have to find where? he was and destroy him before the whole world become a blackout. Good evening, Miss. Murray. Good evening. I wait that if it does not matter for I to have looked for it. London is a solitary place for who it finished to arrive. It is a solitary place when you know it. - With as many people? - Crowds can be solitary. I like the crowds. Please sit down. May I? Please. I enyoyed the day when we pass together in Yorkshire. You and Lady Holmwood, was wellcomed to me. I wait that Lady Holmwood is well. Lucy is dead. We embed her two days ago. Oh dear. Lucy and Jonathan were my closest friends. I don't know what to do. I come here to this restaurant where Jonathan always came? I sleep in Jonathan's room because I want? To be close to it. You want consolation. - Yes. - Human Heat. In sadness times, all we look human heat. I don't have with who I talk to. You have me. I will listen tonight. I will confort you. If we really confront with this Vampire? we must make it to the dawn. Not now, but when he is weakkest. And then, we have a chance to destroy it. If Dracula has a tenth of power I think he has, how we will do that? With faith. Oh! what could be faith? The faith is everything, Lord Holmwood . The future generations will laugh... yes will laugh of our science. But not of our faith. Faith... keps this force not to fear what we do not understand? the blackout, of death. Now you need to say me as its wife was in the coffin. If she drank his blood? she became Dead-Alive, must be destroyed. Did she looked health? Yes. And her teeth? They had grown? Yes. She drank his blood. If we take shortcut this way, we will find a cab close to the river. Miss. Murray. WESTENRA VAULT HIGHGATE CEMETERY I know you. You are my husband. Yes I know what you wanted?

Thus in the Land as in the Sky? Singleton. He is not here. Mina! You... Let her live! Take me. Mina, go! Run, Mina! Go! Why chose death? No! Mina. Throu mystery of the Cruz commands you! The faith of martires commands you! The blood of Christ commands...! Thrue his heart? Do you get his heart? Yes... Yes. Dearly Beloved AMADO JONATHAN HARKER Born 1875 - Left 1899 I walk away for you today. Distanciei me of what it was being said for you. That wasn't you.

It does not stop you and I. Forever I will find you in Vienna, in Florencia? and Paris and New York? in a world that always is opening. I will carry with me all years, my brave... brave boy. Always young, while I grow up. Always full of life. Always, Jonathan... Always. - You had my adress? - Yes. You will contact me if you need to? - Yes, Sir. - Good.
