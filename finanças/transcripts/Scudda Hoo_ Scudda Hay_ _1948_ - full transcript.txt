Well, Pa, I guess this furrow's all finished. What do we do next? Better go clear the brush off the south 20 I reckon, Son. Not without I pick up that drag chain they're fixing in the village. - You better go into town and get it then. - Okay, Pa. I'll stable the team. You know something, Pa? The place looks all right. Looks real pretty. Yeah. This apple looked real pretty too, Son. It's full of worms. I know, Pa. Get away from here, you good-for-nothin' mutt! You leave my dog alone! Why don't you kill her, Pa? Look at the way she treats my dog. - Why don't you kill her? - Oh, talk sense. Now mind you, I ain't saying that's a bad idea. But talk sense. Well, why don't you at least kick her teeth in once in a while? I ain't saying that's a bad idea either, but it ain't feasible. No Dominy ever raised his hand to a female woman. - I said "kick," Pa. - Well, not his foot neither. You hadn't never ought a married her, Pa. I told you that at the time. I wasn't but a little squirt of nine when you done it, but I knew. And I hated her then, and I hate her now. I hate her like tomatoes hate rain. Well, a widower gets lonely, Son. She used to be a mighty good cook. Well, hired girls cook good too. And you always got the right to can 'em when they get sassy. - Yeah. - What's the time, Pa? About four bells. You and your bells. You ain't aboard ship no more. Well, I wish I was aboard ship. I never should have quit the sea. You know somethin'? It smells good. Sure, Son. The soil smells good to a man that's bed to the soil. And I don't see nothin' again' it. But the smell of the sea is somethin' a seaman never gets out of his nostrils. It's a... It's a better, cleaner smell. Yes, sir. The smell of the sea and the sound of the sea... are always callin' to a man that's knowed 'em... and loved 'em and left 'em. I know, Pa. Now what's the time? In hours. Oh, I don't know. It's about 10:00. You better be goin' down to get that drag chain. Yeah. Maybe I can hitch me a ride into town. - Hi, Rad. - Well, hi, Snug. I'm tryin' to hitch me a ride into town. I figured you might be goin' in. How 'bout it? Oh, gosh, I'd love to, Snug, but got chores to do. - Oh. Well, in that case, I'll walk. - Hey, wait a minute. Ma's going in right away. She'll take you. Oh, swell. Gee, you don't look very tidy to be going into town. Well, gosh, I've been plowing all morning. Why don't you dress neat, like your brother? Stretch ain't no brother of mine and you know it. Okay, stepbrother then. His ma married your pa, didn't she? I always think of Stretch as your brother. You always think of Stretch, period. Now wait for me and don't sulk. Say, Snug, Mom promised to buy me a new swimmin' suit. - What color should I get? - Oh, I don't care. - You don't? - Huh-uh. Well, in that case, I think I'll get me a yellow one. Stretch likes me in yellow. - Snug, you need a haircut. - So what? I can think of a lot better ways to spend four bits than getting myself a haircut. Oh, Snug, you're so cute when you get mad. - Good morning, Joe. - Good morning. - Can I leave this here? - Sure. Why not? Hi there, Frank. How 'bout a haircut? Okay. Will you make it snappy, Frank? I'm in kind of a hurry. How's things out at the farm? - Oh, all right, I guess. - Ain't seen Stretch in quite a spell. - Ain't sick, is he? - No. No such luck. That ain't no nice way to talk about your big brother. Now lay off of me, Frank. He ain't no brother of mine and he ain't so big no more. Uh-huh. Think you could whip him in a fight? Could be. I'd sure like to try. Well, here I am, Snug. Anytime you say. Now, now. Didn't know your big brother was here, did you? Now listen, you... Getting kind of big for your britches, ain't you? - Take it easy! - Go on. Let him up. It's okay by me. Lay off, Stretch. You fellas ain't gonna muss up this shop. Now cut it out. You sit still, or I'll cut your ears off. Tune in again at this same time tomorrow morning... Good morning, Son. You sleep good? - Breakfast ready? - Coming up. And now, after station identification, we bring you five minutes of the latest world events... Not to me you don't. - You hungry, Son? - Sure, I'm hungry. Ma, you're slipping. These ain't got no taste and they're tough. Wait till Milt and Snug have "et" and I'll fix another batch for you special. Morning. - I said good morning. - I heard you. You ain't too big yet, young fella, for me to learn you some manners. You tend to your son, Milt. I'll tend to mine. - Where is Snug? - How should I know? Snug? Snug! - Quit yappin'. He ain't in his room. - Well, where is he? Probably swimmin' in the "crick." He swims too much if you ask me. Nobody asked you and it ain't your "crick." Get off the bed, ya fool dog. Come on. Come on. - Morning, Pa. - Hello, Son. Morning. Sorry I'm late. - Get that dog outta here. - Leave him be. He won't hurt none. - Get that dog outta my house! - Your house? Your house! You leave the dog stay. - I said I want the dog outta the house! - I said the dog stays! Hear me? Yes, sir. I heard ya. Get down, Rough. Boy, am I hungry. Hey, where are my hotcakes? You're late. This is a farm, not a hotel. - Fix the boy his breakfast. - Let him fix it his self. Woman, I'm sickened to death of your harping... I ain't gonna waste no more of my life... For once in your life, you are gonna shut up and listen to me! Nine year ago, my Marty died. You was all for joining hands of the home. You and your boy Stretch here along with me and Snug. No sugar-cured ham was ever smoother to the taste... until you got me hog-tied in marriage. Nobody held a gun in your ribs. But from that moment to this here, your clamor-hammer tongue ain't never ceased to swing like an old cow's tail. It ain't so much the fact that you're a woman keeps me from beatin' you up. It's the thought of how much you... and this worthless son of yours would like to land me in jail. But you ain't gonna do it. I'm through. I'm gettin' out. I've stuck it out as long as Snug here was little and needed care. Even such care as you give him. Well, that day is gone. And I'm goin' with it. I never should have quit the sea. And I'm shippin' back to sea right this minute! You don't dast. You're afraid. The years ashore have made you soft. Like a fly drownded in honey, you'll be stuck till you die! I'll show you how soft I be. I'll show you how stuck I be. Ye watch me. Ye watch me walk out that door right now... with naught but my two feet and my two good hands. You just watch me. And I ain't a-comin' back. Attaboy, Pa! I done it. I run him out. I run him out good and his brat along with him. Tony Maule, you're naught but a worthless old drunk. You better do somethin' about that there fence. - Ya hear me? - Yeah, I hear ya. You better do somethin' about that hedge. Or I'll have the law on ya. Ya hear me? Yes, I hear you. I reckon they can hear you way down at the city. That worthless hedge. It's suckin' up the roots of my good wheat! Put your eyes back in, Roarer, and quit scrappin'. I got business with you. You too, Tony. I just made me out a will. Now I'm gonna sign it. And I come over here to get you two fellas as witnesses. - Your will, Milt? - You heard me. - You feelin' sick, Milt? - Heck no. Just happens I got a bellyful of that woman. Happens I know boats better than farmin'. Here ya are. "I hereby leave to my own son... "Daniel Dominy, commonly known as Snug, "everything of which I die possessed. "Signed by Milton Dominy, him being present... and in the presence of each other." That's right. Now you sign right there. - You too, Roarer. - Sign on your own side. Thank ya. Now, Tony, I want you to keep this. If anything happens to me, I want you to see that Snug here gets "his'n." - You can depend on me all right. - Thank you. - Pa, let me come with you. I... - No. I want you to stay here and look after my interests and your own. - Will you do that for me? - Okay, Pa, if that's what you want. Good lad. Oh, uh... Here's, uh, $20 just to cheer you up. Hey, Milt, if you wanna wait half an hour, I gotta go to town. I'll drive ya. No thanks, Roarer. It's better I go this way. - So long, Son. Take care of yourself. - Good-bye, all. - So long, Pa. Good luck. - Good luck, Milt. Hello, Rough, old boy. Now... Now go on back to Snug. Go on. Your father is a fine man, Snug, but stubborn as a mule. - Stubborn as a what, Roarer? - A mule! Them's fightin' words to an old mule skinner. "Stubborn as a mule." What do you know about mules? Not much, but I aim to learn plenty. Gonna buy me a team. You is growed, Snug. If old saw toothed Judy wears on you, how 'bout working for me? - Maybe. Before you commit yourself, Snug, ask him how much. Yeah. How much? Eight dollars a week with dinner. Sundays off and sleep to home. Startin' now. Make it $10. - All right, $10. - Okay, Mr. McGill, it's a deal. Fine. You can ride along to town with me right now. - Gonna size me up a team of mules. - You gonna buy mules today? I sure am. Take a look at this. Reckon my eyes be as good as any man's. So if those mules be any good, I aim to buy 'em for $300. Yeah, what you know about mules you can spit in my eye. - A mule ain't no ordinary creature. - Aaah! He's off again. Come on. Are you workin' for me or him? - You, I guess. - Yeah, go on with him, son. Any day it gets so you can't stand to hear his bellerin', you can come on over with me. Tryin' to steal my help before I get it, huh? He ain't no ordinary help, don't forget that. He's Milt's boy. And you treat him good... or else. You fix that fence! Come on. - Bean! - Hi, Pop. - Come here! - Okay. - What is it, Pop? - Get me my town hat. - Okay. - Hey, Ma, where's my coat? - Hi, Snug. - Do what I told ya! - Okay, okay. - Come on. Rad, where's my town coat? Seems like you done a heap of paintin' around here. Place sure looks good. Well, if you wanna work for me, you'll keep it lookin' good. Plenty of chores to do around a farm like this. Where's my hat and coat? You gotta yell all the time, Pa? Morning, Snug. - Howdy, Mrs. McGill. Hi, Rad. - Hi. What you doin' here so early? He's here because I hired him to work for me. I don't want you wastin' his time lollygaggin'. - Ya hear me? - Me? Why, Pa, I throw 'em back in the "crick" when I hook 'em as little as him. Rad, you're terrible. Look, Pop, even his ears get red when he blushes. - Why ain't you in school? - Because it ain't time yet. Oh. You wait here. I'll get the car. Kinda stuck on Rad, ain't ya? No, Eufraznee, I am not stuck on her. Eufraznee. You quit calling me by that dumb name! You hear me? - You quit it! - It's your given name, Eufraznee. Can I help it that Ma took my name out of a book? My name's Bean and everybody calls me Bean! You quit using that dumb name. Okay, I'll make a deal with you. You quit kidding me about Rad and I'll call you Bean. Okay. It's a deal. But I still think you're stuck on her. Come on, son. Gotta get to town. Bye, Pop. Bye. That ain't no way to drive into a stable, brother. I got no time to waste with small talk. Let me speak to the owner. - I am the owner. - All the more reason to waste no time. I come to look over them mules. My name's McGill. Well, have a cigar, Mr. McGill. Oh, Jim, a customer. Step this way. Magnificent animals, Mr. McGill. A wonderful team. In all my experience... Never mind the description. I'll see 'em. I take it you're a good judge of mules. When I spend my money, I'm a good judge of anything. I could see that at a glance. - Three hundred dollars for them? - I wouldn't give you three cents. I like a man with a sense of humor, Mr. McGill. - Those are not the animals I advertised. - Huh? - They're leadin' em in now. - Uh-huh. Whoa, babies. Well... That's more like it. Yeah. They don't seem to have no blemish. If they had a blemish, Mr. McGill, I wouldn't sell 'em to you. How come you advertise 'em like this? "Price with privilege of return, $500. Your-eyes-are-your-market, $300." I know it's hard for a man like you to understand this, Mr. McGill, some folks would pay an extra $200 just for the privilege of changing their minds. Like a woman. If you'll step into my office, we can settle this thing in a few minutes. Now wait a minute. Don't rush me. I'll make up my mind in my own good time. - Ya hear me? - Take all the time you want, Mr. McGill. Have another cigar. - Hey. What ails these mules? - Can't tell ya, bub. You blab to your dad, and the next thing you know, I have these critters back on my hands. That blowhard ain't no dad of mine. If he was to get stuck, I'd bust my sides laughin'. Here's the straight dope. These are swell mules. But they's one-driver mules. Fella what drove 'em is still in the army. - He could make 'em jump through hoops. - Yeah? Yeah. Gentle as lambs. But when it comes to drivin' 'em, they just won't be drove. Ain't nobody around here to even bridle 'em. Well, what's their names? Well, this here's the jenny. Her name is Moonbeam. - Hiya, Moonbeam. - This here's Crowder. - Hello, Crowder. - Good name for him too. Get him all riled up and he'll crowd you. - He don't look mean. - He ain't, unless you get him that way. One thing I want to tell you about those mules, Mr. McGill. I... Never mind the sales talk. I bought 'em. When can I get 'em in my place? I'll have the truck deliver 'em first thing tomorrow. All right. Snug, come on. Rough, stay there. Evenin'. Thought you shipped out with your pa. Uh-uh. Then where you been all day? Who give you leave to loaf? I ain't been loafin'. What's for supper, besides beer? Them as don't work don't eat. All right. But don't figure on running me outta here like you did my pa. This is still his place, and I'll be around. So don't get any idea you own it. Even if you have taken his chair. Hear me, you Snug. Work this farm or get out's my answer to you. - I'm workin' over to McGill's. - Then sleep over to McGill's. I'll sleep here whenever I please, or nobody sleeps. And I'll eat here, or nobody eats. Hark at him, layin' down the law. That's the charge my pa give me, and I'll carry it out... until he gets back to do his own accountin'. Talks big, don't he, Ma? When I was but nine, Stretch, and you was all of 16, you beat me so hard I was maimed for a month. Yeah. Well, I growed since then. You ain't growed near enough. Maybe not. Least ways, I ain't forgot. Come on, Rough. Come on, Belinda. Give. Come on! There. That's fine. Now get them mules unloaded quick! Ya hear me? Snug! Snug! Come here! Rad and Mommy, look at the mules! Come on! All right, get that other mule outta here. Come on! - Oh, boy! Oh, boy! - Keep that kid outta here, Ma! Boy, them's mules. - Can I ride one, Pop? Can I ride one? - No! You wanna get killed? - I can ride. - Get that kid outta here. Go get me them bridles. Ya hear me? - Well, sir, now they all yours. - Sign here, please. - Thank you. - Here you are. Here, take this. Get back, all of ya! Pop, don't holler so loud. You'll scare 'em. Stand still, ya stubborn critter! I'll bridle ya if it's the last thing I ever do! Don't get sore, Pop. He only wants to play. Stand still, ya hear me? He heard you. Ya stubborn critter! I'll bridle ya! - That ain't the way to do it, Pa! - Careful, Pa. Don't show him the bridle. That's what's scarin' him. You won't get no place trying to bully a mule. Tony says... Ah, the heck with Tony! I'll handle him. Okay. - Why ain't you in school? - 'Cause it's Saturday, Pop. Why does he always gripe about me not being in school? - Hi, Stretch. - Hi, Rad. You wanna see something beautiful? Pa just bought a team of mules. Come on. Look. Oh, boy! This is better than a circus. - Now you hush up. - Tell her to pipe down. Now I'll bridle ya. Gimme that! - Here. - Oh, Pa, be careful now. Pop, be careful! Stretch, do something! - Help! Help! Move over! - Snug, help him! Leave him be! Quit that! Lay off of him! - Pop, are ya hurt? - Are you all right, Pa? - Are ya hurt? - They're kinda frisky, ain't they? Fetch me my gun. Get me my gun. I'll kill 'em! - You're crazy. - Crazy am I? I'll get her myself. Tried to crowd me to death. Now wait a minute. Ah, there ain't no law against butcherin' your own livestock. - I'll buy 'em off of ya. - What? - Five dollars a week for a whole year. - Five dollars... That's only $260. I'll give you $20 down. And that's $280. You'll only lose $20 in the whole deal. Sold. Five dollars each week out of your wages for one whole year. Okay. Here's the 20 my pa give me. - Don't sell 'em, Pop. They're pretty! - Now you keep outta this. - Has anybody got a pencil? - Yeah, sure. You'll write down what I dictate. I, Daniel Dominy, known as Snug, hereby promise to pay Robert McGill... - Known as Roarer. - Shh, quiet. Promise to pay Robert McGill five dollars each week out of my wages... due from him for one year. No more, no less, from the period of this date... for value received in the shape of two mules. - That all? - No. If this contract is broke at anytime, the mules again become the property of said Robert McGill. Agreed? Sure. Sure, I'll sign it any way you like. - Right. You sign as witnesses. - Me too! Me too! Boy, oh, boy. All right, now take it easy. There. I ain't ever gonna let anyone scare ya or hurt you again. Attaboy, Crowder. Good boy. Good boy. Hello, Moonbeam. Hey, Moonbeam. Now, now, now, just relax, baby. Everything's gonna be all right. Snug! Quit that bellerin'. You want them to start up again? Sign this! Get those mules outta here... 'fore they wreck what's left of my barn. Here. Where you aim to take them critters? None of your business. Listen, you Snug... Where do you think you're gonna get the feed for 'em? I ain't relyin' on you. You bring 'em home and see what happens. My mules is well raised. I wouldn't take 'em within miles of you or your ma. Come on, Crowder. We'll go see Tony. He's partial to mules. Hello, Chris. Come here, boy. Come here. Come on. Hey, Tony! Hey, Tony! Come on. Go on. - Whoa, whoa. - Oh, Snug boy, them is mules. - Yes, sir, they're all right. - Ain't they somethin', Tony? How come Roarer give you leave to come over and show 'em to me? 'Cause they ain't his no more. - They's mine. - Yourn? You touched in the head? I ain't kiddin'. I bought 'em off of him. - You bought 'em? - That's right. How come Roarer'd sell 'em? After they kicked his barn down, he didn't want 'em no more. Kicked his barn down? I gotta find someplace to keep 'em. For tonight, could I tether 'em on your place? No, son. They gotta be hobbled. Ain't a rope'd hold 'em. And nary a fence. You put 'em in the barn. I'll go open it for you. - So you bought 'em off of Roarer, huh? - You said it. - What'd you use for money? - Well, I gave him the 20 my pa give me, and then I went in hock on the wages for a year. - Son, don't never go into hock for nothin'! - No? No! 'Ceptin' maybe for a team of mules like them. All right, bring 'em in. Go on. - Is this floor safe for 'em? - If it ain't, they won't step on it. Come on. Come on, Crowder. - Put 'em over there. - Try it anyway. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Them is mules. Boy, that smells good. Boy, that is good. Good and heavy too. - Fetch that loaf of bread and we'll eat. - You betcha. I thought you swore off of bourbon. That's cookin' bourbon. You leave it be. - Boy, this is really somethin'. - Yeah. Figure around a bit... and the chicken stew's got more flavor to it than the strings to a "pianee." - You hungry? - I'll say. You know, Judy won't even give me a bite of food if I'm two seconds late. Ah, the book of Revelations got words for that woman: the abomination of desolation! You said it. Not like to your true ma Marty she ain't. Yeah. Gosh, if Ma were here, I bet... Now, son, let's not start that. You're one of the luckiest boys on the face of the earth and you don't know it. What boy can look at a woman... every day of his life and thank heaven she ain't his mother? Not one in a thousand. - I guess I'm pretty lucky. - Mm-hmm. Now about the mule. How come you got 'em? Well, did you ever hear of a one-driver mule? So that's the blemish, huh? Yeah, I heard of 'em. I owned 'em. Well, are they dumb or what? Boy, don't ever use that word around a mule. Why not? So you think mules is dumb, huh? - Well, no, I... - Yeah? It happens there's counties that brag on a man with as much brains as a mule. But in all my born days I ain't never met him. What man don't eat his self sick from time to time? But does a mule ever founder? No, sir. He's got too much sense. He'll nibble at a full feed, then blow his nose and walk off. Did you ever see a mule over drink when he's hot? 'Tain't mules that's dumb, it's folks. So dumb they think a horse is intelligent. What does a horse do when he puts his foot through a barbed wire fence? Tell me that. - I can't. - He saws it off! Yes, sir, he draws back in fright and saws the hoof clean off at the joint. But not Mr. Mule. Mr. Mule lifts his foot up and out, dainty as a dancer, and goes on eatin'. Why is it a horse never jumps barbed wire? - I don't know. - Because he can't think. But I seen a mule argue with his self. I seen him think. He says, "Well, see, here is barbed wire. It's four feet high. Guess I better clear it." He jumps over it neat as a kitten. It's only fools that think horses has got brains and dog's man's best friend. Why, a mule will lay down his life day by day... for the right man until he dies. You talk like you love mules better than dogs even. I'll grant dogs has got brains and hearin' and feelin'. But you have to feed a dog. But the mule feeds you! All his life. And I own a team of 'em. - Want a lick? - No. - It's good, clean ice. - No, thanks. Okay. Gosh, working for Pop sure has made you crabby. You said it. - Kinda hot, ain't it? - Go away! Gosh, I only asked if it wasn't kinda hot. Well, it don't get no cooler with you sittin' around askin' dumb questions. Bet you'd love to be swimmin' right now. Wouldn't ya? - No. - Oh, yes, you would. That's what Rad's doin'. So what? I ain't interested. I'll bet Stretch is interested. She snuck off real early this morning. Took the skiff and headed downstream. Took her new swimmin' suit too. The yellow one. Are you sure she's with Stretch? What do you care if you ain't interested? Hey. Psst. What're you doin'? Shh. Rad's comin' down. She's all dressed up. - Hi, Snug. - Hello. Y'all through? Yeah. You tired? Anybody who works all day for your pa had better be tired. - Well, don't let Pa work you so hard then. - Uh-huh. Poor Snug. Oh, it's coolin' off. I feel wonderful. - Uh-huh. - Are you doing anything tonight? Yeah. Important business. - Oh, you and them mules. - That's right. And pretty soon them mules will do anything I want. Well, they can't go to the movies and hold hands with you. Good night, Rad. Well, I like that, after I practically invited you... I hope Stretch liked the yellow swimmin' suit. - How did you know I was with Stretch? - A little bird told me. Uh-oh. Bean! Ma! Ma! She's chasing me again! Careful of the tools there, son. Gee, looks like you been kind of busy. Yeah. You know what them be? Look like bridles. Big ones. Yeah, but them ain't no common bridles. Them's mule bonnets. - Mule bonnets? - Yeah. What's the difference? Well, you take one and I'll take the other. I'll show you the difference. Moonbeam. Moonbeam. Easy. Uh... I guess we better leave these on for the time being. Now here's the difference. And don't think they don't know it. Instead of slipping it on over their ears like you do with a common, ordinary bridle, you unhook it here, see? Whoa, Moonbeam. Then you just sort of ease it on up... and get this in back of their ears without never touchin' 'em, see? Gosh almighty, Tony, you done it. - Yeah. - You bridled her. See them ears, son? Proud. They stay proud. The womenfolk wear their pride all over: legs, cheeks, eyes, mostly the hair. But a mule crowds it all into his upstanding ears. Now let's see you get over there and bridle Crowder. - Do you think he'll let me do it? - Never know till you find out. Go on over there and try it. I'll go with you. Whoa, now. Whoa, now, Crowder. Go slow. Take it easy. I don't want him kicking the back out of this barn. Now... Now take it easy. And mind what I told ya about them ears. Hold on, Crowder. Come on, boy. There you are. I done it, Tony. I done it. Good boy. Now unbridle them and come in the house. We got lots to do. Moonbeam. You know what, Tony? Maybe you'll think I'm crazy... Yeah? But if I had my choice of the mules or the world, I'd choose Moonbeam for one and Crowder for the other. Oh, you got it bad, son. Mule fever. - You'd be lucky at that. - Why? Oh, every boy has his dog. I've heard tale of a prisoner being in love with a mouse. But the life of such pets on this earth ain't long. Them mules ain't pets. That's right. Mules is different. You know, if I was to name the one quality above all others of a mule, I'd call it sadness. Why sadness? Well, a man has his hopes and his children. And you know, there's even dogs can trace their line back a hundred year. But a mule's got no hope before or after. Why, his life is just a single link without no chain. A mule ain't got no yesterday and no tomorrow. The only thing he can hope for is that he'll find a man he can love. Some does, but most don't. And the many that don't, well, they're the saddest of all. Tony, them mules let me bridle and unbridle 'em. Yeah? Well, do you think maybe I could learn to drive 'em? Could be. I drove a passel of mules in my day. Ain't drove 'em for the past 20 year. But you know, there's nights when I can still sense the smell of the sweat... and hear that far-off cry of... Scudda hoo! Scudda hay! What's that? Well, it means "gee" and "ha" to you, boy. But you won't find it in nary a book, nor in the memory of many livin' men. But my team, they'd lean to the ground for me... all day and every day... Till they drawed theirs elves to death. You ain't the only one who's got mule fever. I still got it. And I ain't never seen a better team than you bought there. And let me tell you, son, a man with a team of mules, well, sir, he's in business. - Gonna help me, Tony? - Sure. Sure, I'll help ya. You just give me a few days of tinkerin', and I'll see what I can do. Scudda hoo. Scudda hay! - All right, ain't they, Mike? - Yeah, you're right, Tony. I'm glad I came over. I ain't never seen a better team. - Hiya, Tony. - Hi, Snug. Sorry I'm late, but Roarer kept me plowin' till after sundown. Snug, I want you to meet Mike Malone. This is Milt Dominy's boy, Mike. - Howdy, Snug. - Hello. Mr. Malone is foreman of a big logging track north of here... and he's short of work mules, so he thought he'd come over and take a look at yourn. - How do they stack up, Mr. Malone? - Strong a team as I ever seen. All the work you want anytime you want it. Gee, that's swell. - Course we aren't even sure... - How much you paying, Mike? - Fifteen dollars a day. - Any piecework? - Yeah, sure, but it all evens up. - We'll take the piecework. - Suits me. - Tony... - Yes, sir, we'll take the piecework. - Okay. Well, so long, Tony. So long, Snug. Report to the track whenever you're ready. Good night. - Night. - Good night, Mike. But, Tony, we aren't even sure they can drive yet. Listen. You got a lot to learn. Never let on what you don't know until you do know. Now that he's gone, we can find out for ourselves. Fixed the wagon and the harness as best I could. So, let's see what they can do. Now? Yeah. After a week of tinkerin', we're ready to try 'em. Right now. Well, here ya are, son. Go to it. Me? Think I'm crazy? I might ruin 'em for good. - You're the one to do it, Tony. - Yeah, but they's your mules. Yeah, but you drove mules long before I was even born. Go ahead. I'll stand back here and watch. Giddyap. Crowder! Crowder! Moonbeam! Come on, Crowder. Come on, Moonbeam. Please, for his sake. Crowder! Moonbeam! They's your mules. You try drivin' 'em. Heck, Tony, I wouldn't even try. If they won't drive for you, they won't drive for no one. Sit down, son. Did you ever think on pride, Snug? No, not particularly. Well, pride has broke more men, split up more homes... and caused more murders than any other creature of the mind. Couple of minutes ago you seen what it done to me. I wished for a gun so's I could kill them mules, just like Roarer done. I wouldn't have blamed you either, Tony. You don't mean that, Snug. I wouldn't want you to. Now them mules ain't never kicked nor crowded me. In all fairness, I got to say I never knowed a more politer team. They sure broke the back of my pride and busted my heart wide open. I'm back to reason now. You go drive your mules. Tony, maybe it ain't like you think. Maybe the mules just can't be bothered with pullin' a light wagon. You know that fallen log at the top of your pasture? Yeah. Well, I got a notion to hitch 'em to that. And maybe then with a heavy load, well, they'll work. Say, that might be a good "idee." Mules has got pride too. Let's go roust us out a drag chain. All right, son, I guess you're about ready to try 'em. Yeah. Quit sizin' up that log. You ain't gonna pull it. Gosh, Tony, it's bigger than I figured. Their legs are a whole lot stronger than you know. Come on. - Here you are. - Gee, Tony, supposing they won't... Shut up. Don't be puttin' the wrong ideas in their heads. A mule even knows what you're thinking. Now go on. Okay, Tony. Where do you want your old log? Now you're talkin'. Any place down there but by the barn. Okay. Here we go. Come on, Moonbeam. Crowder. Hup! Scudda hoo! Scudda hay! Easy, Moonbeam. Come on, Crowder. Come on, Moonbeam! Come on, Crowder! Come on! Come on! - Scudda hoo! Scudda hay! - Come on! Come on! Come on! It's movin'! Scudda hoo! Scudda hay! Come on! Come on! Come on, Crowder! Come on! Hey! Get off of there before you get yourself killed. Whoa. Whoa. They done it, Tony. They drove for me. They drove for me! Good team! You done swell, Crowder. Good, Moonbeam. Remember what you said, Tony, about a man owning a team of mules as being in business? - Yes, sir, and that's us. - You said it. Uh-oh. Here comes Superman. - Hi, Stretch. - Hi, Rad. - What are you doing over here? - Oh, nothing. Just happened by. - We're busy. - Bean. There's a good movie in town tonight. You wanna go with me? Oh. Sorry, I can't, Stretch. Them eggs don't grow on trees. Suppose you're already goin' with Snug, huh? Snug? I hardly ever see him. The minute he's through here, he's off with the mules of his. I bet he's sorry he ever got stuck with them. He is not. - He drives 'em. - Are you kiddin'? - Your pa couldn't even bridle 'em. - Snug can do anything with 'em. Him and Tony got 'em so they'll haul logs and everything. Well, what's he aimin' to do with 'em, sell 'em? Course not. He's gonna work out his year with Pa, like in the contract. And then he's gonna go over to the logging camp and get his self a job. - Make 15 bucks a day, he says. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. - Sure you don't wanna go to that movie? - Mm-mmm. - Well, I'll be seein' ya. So long, Rad. - So long. Gosh, Rad, you talk too much. Does he have to know everything? Well, what do you want? I wanna talk to you, Roarer. What's on your mind? - Plenty. - All right. Come on in. No, it's business. You come on outside. - Well, what do you want? - Oh, not so much... for me. Plenty for you, if you've got the grit to reach out and take it. Listen, you remember them mules Snug done you out of a couple of weeks ago? Done me nothin'. It was me done him. Get my money back, won't I? A good helper to boot. Oh, hogwash. You got rooked. Listen, Snug knowed what he was doin'. - Them mules will drive. - Drive? What can't be bridled can't be drove. You saw it yourself. Does it take a drill to reach your brain, Roarer? I just saw Snug drivin' 'em right now. They was haulin' their own weight as easy as kiss-my-foot. Yes, sir. Snug sure stuck you good and plenty. You wanna stick him back or don't ya? If you do, my price is share and share alike. - What are you drivin' at? - Well, look, Roarer. I know at the loggin' camp they're willing to pay 15 bucks a day for good work mules. With me drivin' 'em, that's 90 bucks a week you and me can split. The mules ain't mine no more. You remember that contract you wrote, don't ya? Yeah, sure. Snug has to pay me five dollars each week out of his wages. Yeah, but you added if the contract was broke at any time, them mules was you'n again. If Snug be as slick as you say, how could I persuade him to forfeit? Easy. Fire him. Well, how would that help? Snug's a good worker. He could easy get placed... At more than I pay him too. Besides, he still got the mules, ain't he? Well, leave that to me. I ain't so dumb neither. Don't ya get it? He forfeits one week's pay to you and the contract's broke. How can he pay, happen he's in no shape to work for you or anybody else? I don't want any trouble. You hear me? Won't be no trouble. I can work them mules all day and never sweat. It's easy money too, Roarer... Week in, week out, sure as a milk check. All you gotta do is fire him. Leave the rest to me. You wanna shake on it and let me handle everything? Look here, Stretch. I'll be party to nothin' where anybody gets hurt. No matter what you do, him and me has to have this thing out. - Remember now... - Just leave it to me. I don't want no trouble with the law. You bad girl. What do you mean comin' in so late? Look... You better get undressed and go to bed. Don't forget to say your prayers. - Rad? - Yeah? Do you suppose Pop says his prayers every night? I don't know. Why? Well, if he don't, he sure ought to. And just in case he don't, I think I'm gonna pray for him. Good sermon, Reverend. Thank you, Judge. Thank you very kindly. - Good morning, Reverend. - Good morning, Rad. - How are you? - Fine. Bean, were you in Sunday school this morning? - Sure. Mom always makes me. - Good for Mom. - Good morning, Mrs. McGill. - Good morning, Reverend. If you're lookin' for Stretch, don't waste your time. He don't never come to church, bad as he needs it. - Oh, hush up and go wait in the car. - Okay. - Hi, Rad. - Hi, Betty. Come on, dear. - Whoa! - Oh, boy! Look! Hello, Mrs. McGill. Hiya, Bean. Hello, Rad. Hi. How are you? Snug. That's a swell pair of mules you got there. Whose are they? They's mine. - Want I should drive you home, Rad? - Go ahead, Rad. Okay. I don't mind. - Want a ride, Ches? - Sure. How 'bout you, Jeff? Come on, Bean. We'll all go. Okay. Hey! Wait a minute! I didn't ask all these others! - Aw, heck! - We don't need no invite. Thanks for the ride, Snug. Hey, Rad, you sit over here by me or nobody goes. Oh, for heaven's sake. What a fuss to make. I mean what I say. All right. All right. Now, are you happy? I'd be a lot happier if you hadn't asked these others. - Oh, what makes you so mean? - He's jealous, that's what. - You shut up! - Well, it's true. Come on, Beam. Come on, Beam. You never watch! Hey, quit lookin' at Rad. She's only tryin' to burn you up. - I wanna tell you somethin'. - Don't bother me now. Wait. I can't hear you. What? Hey, Rad. Rad, cut it out. - Oh, go on! Scram! - Yeah. Beat it. We want to be alone. - You leave her alone. - Temper, temper. - He ain't botherin' me. - Hey, quit showin' off, Rad. I'm not gonna stand for that. Is that so? Listen, Snug Dominy, you may own them mules, but you don't own me. Look, Rad... The way they fight, you'd think they's married! - Where you goin', Rad? - Hey, Rad, come on back. I ain't tellin' ya. We were only kidding. Come on back. Don't leave, Rad. No. You're all behaving very childish. You're a dolt, Snug. It's your fault. Let her go. Wait, Rad. Come on, Ches. Let's head her off. Okay! It won't do ya no good. You'll never catch me. And, now, if you'll listen to me, I'll tell you somethin' about them mules of yourn. What about them mules? Well, I was sort of hidin'... and I sort of heard my pop makin' a deal with Stretch. They're plannin' to get them mules away from you. Oh, yeah? How? Stretch is plannin' to beat you up so bad you won't be able to work for anybody. Then you'll miss out on the payments. Get it? Is this somethin' you made up, or are you tellin' me the truth? I wouldn't lie about somethin' that makes my pop almost a crook. - Does Rad know anything about this? - Of course not. Do you think my sister would be on her way to see Stretch if she did? What makes you think she's gonna go see Stretch? Because she's been itchin' to all morning, and your actin' so bossy give her just the chance she's lookin' for. Thanks, Bean. I told ya I didn't wanna go ashore. Come on. Let's walk a ways. - Here. I'll carry ya. - No! Stop it, Stretch. Put me down. Put me down! Come on! Get up if you wanna get knocked down again! Stop! Stop it, Snug! You're killing him! Well, you wanted him. Now you can have him. - You want I should go get my pa? - No! You're stayin' here. Help me up. Listen, repeat about what you seen here today, I'll get ya. Come on. Help me in my boat. Oh! Yes, sir. I fixed him good, Tony. Hold still now. Ouch! - Is that horse liniment? - Yes, that's horse liniment. I ain't never heard no horse complain. Now hold still. Boy, I hit him with all my might. I know ya whooped him, but hold still. There's one eye he won't use for a long time. There's an ear you ain't gonna use unless you let me fix it. Hold still. After what I did to his face, it'll call for a month of mendin'. That's good. That'll hold you. - You through? - Yeah. Now, Tony, let's figure a bit. Stretch won't tell and neither will his ma. Not on your life. And Rad won't tell. You bet she won't. Not after what happened to that pretty boy date of hers. Mmm. So what? So with nobody tellin' I can easy get Roarer to fire me, can't I? All right. Roarer fires you. Then what? Gee, Tony, you ought to borrow the brain of a mule. After he fires me, I take my team over to the loggin' camp and we go to work. Fifteen bucks a day, partner. - That's five dollars a week for Roarer. - Yeah. - There's feed for the team. - Sure. There's new oak stalls with feed bins for their bellies. We'll get 'em. - New shiny harness for the back. - We can do that. - And shoes all around, eight of 'em. - We can still swing it. With a little figurin', I guess we could. What are you doin', smellin' for rain? Nope. I figure Bean might be snoopin' around here. Wouldn't put it past her to be up on the roof or underneath the floor. Snug. Come here. - What do you want around here? - I had to come, Snug. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Let me see. Oh, Snug. Why don't you go see how Stretch is? Maybe he'd like you to hold his hand. You've got a right to be sore. And how. I hadn't ought to gone to see him this afternoon. You said it. Oh, I hope I never see him again. Well, it ain't no skin off my nose if you do or if you don't. Oh, don't say that, Snug. Please. Unless you mean it. Did you mean it when you said you never wanted to see him again? Cross my heart and hope to die. Remember when we was kids, we came here once... and you carved our initials in this tree. It don't show no more. I can still see it. At least, I can remember it. Don't you? I guess. Oh, Snug. Your poor lip. It ain't nothin'. It... don't hurt. You mean, if a girl was to try to kiss you, it wouldn't be painful? - Wanna try? - Mm-hmm. Gotta find out sooner or later. Did it hurt? I wouldn't be knowin' by a little peck like that. Did it hurt that time? Yeah. And it was swell. Oh, Snug. I've been such a little fool. - Such a little heel. - You said it. - Bean! - Shh! - Where'd you come from? - Shh! - How'd you get over here? - I followed Rad. I snuck in here while you wasn't lookin'. - What for? - I'm snoopin', Tony. I wanted to be sure she had sense enough to make up with Snug. Don't you know what happens to little girls what snoops? - Sure. - What? They get hep to things. Hi, Pop! I got the mail! Watch out for the car! Snug! Snug! - You seen Snug anyplace? - Huh-uh. Ran off and left my tractor running, darn him. - Snug! - Shh! You're scarin' my kitty. - Where is that worthless boy? - I don't know. Where's Rad? - She ain't up at the house. - Well, where is she? Search me. Maybe she's in swimmin'. Oh! I didn't tell where Snug was, did I? - Hey, you! Snug! - Uh-oh! Get out of there! What do you think you're doing? You know what time it is? You ain't hired to go swimmin'! - Take it easy, Pa. - You keep out of this. - Well, get out of there! You hear me? - Who couldn't? Idiot! You know you left that tractor runnin' up there? Well, what do you know about that? Oh, so you think it's funny, do ya? Who's gonna pay for the gas? - Aw, shut up! - Snug. What did you say? You heard me. I said, "Shut up!" Who's gonna buy me a new pair of ears, the way you're always yellin'? You're fired! Get off my place! You're fired! Okay. It suits me fine. Oh, Snug. You hadn't ought to been so fresh. It worked though. - I wanted him to fire me. - But why? Aw, you're just a girl. You wouldn't understand. Move over. Someday maybe I'll tell ya. But, Snug, I wanna know now. Tell me. Don't worry. I know what I'm doin' now. - And I know what I'm gonna do. - What? Put my mules to work, for both of us. Snug Dominy, if you don't tell me exactly... Look. Do you wanna be Mrs. Snug Dominy some day? - Mm-hmm. - Okay then. Shut up. For Pete's sake. Stalled again? A fine team like that's got a right to decent harness. - They ain't got a chance. - Yeah? Don't you worry, Mike. When we get paid tonight, they'll get their chance. Okay. Gosh, Tony. He's right. We're spending more time mendin' than we are haulin'. Listen, son, if a team can't trust a harness, they wouldn't pull a toothpick. Now quit botherin' me, will ya? Scudda hoo! Scudda hay! Come on, Crowder! Come on! Come on, Beam! Come on! Whoa! Hiya, Mac! - You lookin' for Tony? - Yeah. Have you seen him? Seen him at the pay window. Said to give you a message. Yeah? Drive the team on home and not to wait. He had stuff to buy. - He'll get along home later. - Okay. Thank you, Mac. Come on, Beam. Hey, Rad! Psst! - What's up? - Shh! Come with me. - Well, what's wrong? - Shh! Pop's talking to Sheriff Bursom. He's plottin' against Snug some more. It's in the contract! Five dollars a week, every week! If the contract's broke, them mules is mine again! But the contract ain't broke yet, Roarer. It's Saturday and he still ain't paid me my five dollars! Ya hear me? Heck, you fired him, Roarer. Darned right, I fired him. Got fresh with me. Where's Snug at anyhow? - Why don't he come? - Well, he's down at the logging camp. They gotta work late there. He better make it by midnight... or Pop sure as heck will take them mules. - Ow! - Look out! Why ain't you in school? Gosh. He never even asked if I got hurt. Thanks for the buggy ride. Timber! Gosh, Tony. You're drunk. - So am I. - Come on. Tony! You forgot your bundle. Come on, Tony. I've been waiting here for hours. I gotta talk to ya. - Whoa. - Come on, Tony. Now don't get mad at me. Wait till you see what I got. All right. Thanks for the ride, Elmer! So long, Tony. So long, Tony. So long, fellas! Never mind about them, Tony. You're going to bed. I gotta get over to McGill's. Come on. Now sit down, Tony. - Come on. There. - Get away, Rough. Come on. Let me help you off with your jacket. All right. I don't get this way often, Snug. - I know, Tony. - I'm sorry I... Sure. You found some cookin' bourbon. How did you know? Hey, wait till you see what I bought them mules. - That-That's swell, Tony. - And what I brung you. Listen, Tony, I gotta get over to Roarer's tonight. I gotta give him the money. Let me have five dollars, huh? Five dollars? J-Just five dollars. Oh. Five dollars. It's here someplace. Gotta be here someplace. You see them red tassels? When Moonbeam... Where's our money? Have you spent all our money? - The proudest... - Tony, have you spent it all? Spent it. Could be. It... could be. Good ol' Snuggy. Tony, don't go to sleep on me. Wake up. I gotta have five dollars or I'll lose my mules. Tony, listen to me. What am I gonna do? It's too late to borrow the money. Tony! Oh, thanks, Roarer. That sure was a mighty fine supper, Lucy. Well, I'm glad you liked it, Tod. - I baked the pie, Mr. Bursom. - Well! In that case, young lady, I'm doubly glad your father had business with me. Business? What business? Private business. Ain't no concern of nobody's but mine. What's that? Oh. I didn't hear nothin'. You did so. That's Ches Forrester's whistle. All her beaus got different whistles. I can tell 'em a mile off. Ches whistle's real pretty. Wish I could do like him. Ouch! She kicked me! That girl gets her temper from you, Pop. Hey! Psst! - Hi, Rad. - Hi, Ches. What you doin' here? - I got somethin' to tell ya. - Well, what is it, Ches? - It's about Snug. - What about him? I don't know what to do. What do you mean? Is somethin' wrong? No. He's all right. It's like this, Rad. I ain't supposed to know what messages come through the office, and I ain't supposed to talk about 'em, but one come through today. - For Snug? - No, for his stepmother. They notified her first 'cause she's the widow. Oh, no. Yeah. Milt Dominy, buried at sea. - Oh, poor Snug. - That's why I come to you, Rad. Snug don't live to home no more, and if he did, that woman wouldn't tell him. - Somebody should tell him. - Yeah. I'd tell him myself, but you're his gal... and I figured you could tell him better than me. Okay. I will. Thanks for comin' over, Ches. Careful, Bean. It was already chipped. - Ma, I gotta talk to you about Snug. - Shh! Snug just got here while you was talkin' to Ches. He's in there now with Pop. You're wastin' your time! I won't do it! Listen to him. Look, Roarer, you gotta listen. I'm tellin' ya, I ain't fixed to pay till Monday night. - I heared ya. - All I'm askin' is you should take my note. Ten dollars to stand for five, only till Monday. - Ten for five! - Not if it was 20! Not if you was to give me 50 for five. Contract says you gotta pay me tonight or forfeit them mules. - But, Sheriff, I can't... - You got until midnight, Snug, else Roarer can take 'em. - That's the law. - Once they's mine again... - But they'll never drive for you. - They'll drive or I'll kill 'em. - Sell their weight for glue. - Please, Roarer, listen. I can't... Is that the right time, Sheriff? Yeah. - Roarer. - Aw! - Give the kid a break, Roarer. - You keep out of this, Tod. Oh, Ma, we just gotta help him. Could you give me the money? I'd like to help you both, but I don't see how I can. Your pa'd never forgive me. Oh, there must be somethin' we could do. Ma, what do you suppose makes Pop so mean? I don't know, dear. The Bible says when people do bad things, they roast in eternal fire. Will Pop roast? Ain't there nothin' you can do, Tony? Oh, I made a mess of things already. It was me that brung all this trouble on you. Oh, forget it. If I just hadn't of gone and gotten drunk. Aw, skip it. This ain't no time for a cryin' jag. At least ways, you ain't again' me. They are. But ain't there no way we can stop 'em? You gotta face the facts, son. This time he's got the law on his side. Suppose we hitch 'em to the wagon and drive 'em across the county line? - Can he take 'em then? - We ain't got time for that. And 'sides, it'll only get you into more trouble. Here they come. - Shut up! - Look, Roarer. You got me into this. Let me handle it. Mmm. Tony, you better open up. All right. All right. I'm comin'. I'm glad I never voted for you. I wouldn't be able to sleep nights. Tony, I don't like it no more than you do. - It's midnight. I want them mules! - Now, wait a minute, Roarer. - Gimme until Monday. - Out of my way. - Leave him take 'em, son. - Roarer! They're his now. It's all right, Snug. Get away from there! Leave 'em alone! Here! - What ails you? - Oh, I think you're horrible! Here. Here's the five dollars. I'm payin' it for Snug. Happen it's after midnight, but maybe you'll still take it. Go on. Look at it good, why don't ya? It might be counterfeit. I wouldn't want that my pa should be cheated out of nothin'! Now, Rad, I... Before I was old enough to go to church, you and Ma taught me the Ten Commandments. "Though shalt not covet," you always told me. Fine one you were to talk. Ain't a moment since you sold them mules to Snug... but what you've coveted them and tried to get 'em back. - Now, you listen to me! - That's right! Roar! Bluster! Shout! Scream! You've done it all your life, scarin' the wits out of Mom and Bean and me. Well, it don't scare me no more. You could holler till the cows come home, it still wouldn't make the wrong you done right. And there's another commandment you taught me. "Honor thy father and thy mother." Well, I can honor Mom. She's good. She didn't mean to cross you up, honest she didn't. It's just that she knew this was wrong. She give me the money out of her savings. Oh, I wish I could honor you like I do her. I can't now. Oh, Pa, how could ya? How could ya? - Hey! I been waitin' for ya. - What do you want? - Evenin', Roarer. - Holy Moses. - What happened to you? - Oh, I, uh... - Got in a smash-up with my car. - Uh-huh. Appears more like somebody beat the daylights out of ya. Well, what do ya want? This ain't no time to be hangin' around my place. I, uh, wanna talk to ya about them mules. To heck with them mules! I don't wanna hear about them mules again ever! - Wait a minute. We got a bargain. - Well, it's off! Get me? It's off! How come? Don't you want 'em no more? I do not. I wash my hands of 'em. If them mules was gold-plated and give to me on a gold platter I wouldn't want 'em. - Wait a minute. You're crazy. - Hearken you, Stretch! I never should've listened to you in the first place. - I want no part of you or them mules... - Okay, Roarer. You can back out on me if you want to. Me, I ain't through yet. You better not try to cross me neither. If I can't have them, Snug ain't gonna have them. You... You keep your big mouth shut. If you start talkin', I'm liable to talk too. - Hi, Pop. - What are you doin' here? - Gettin' a drink of water. - Why ain't you in bed? There ain't no water in bed, Pop. Oh. You run along to bed right now. Wanna come and tuck me in? All right. Wait a minute. Long as you're up. Let's see how much you've growed, huh? How much, Pop? Must be more than an inch. Oh, swell. - You gonna get them mules, Pop? - Mules? Don't you dast even mention mules to me again, you hear me? Mules! Them mules is a plague on this house! I'm glad it was you who told me about my pa, Rad. He was... - He always... - I'm so sorry, Snug. Well, he loved the sea, Rad. That's the way he would've wanted it. I just wish he could've seen my mules once before it happened. Yes, sir. I wish he could've seen me drive my team. I wished he could've too. Milt sure would've got a kick out of that. - What's that, Tony? - Milt's will. He give it to me to keep the day he left. - Yeah. I forgot. - I ain't forgot. You own more than a team of mules now, Snug. You own your pa's farm. - What about Stretch and Judy? - You leave that to me. I'll take this over to Judge Still well in the morning. He'll fix it. He'll fix them too. You know, Snug, that piece of paper... is just like your pa's fist come back to knock both out of Dominy farm... so's a Dominy can live there in peace. You know, it'd, eh, sort of make a nice home for the both of you. That is if... If that's the way you feel about it. Okay, Moonbeam. You had enough to drink? Come on. Come on. I'll stable the team. You bring the harness. Yeah. Later. I'm busy. Figurin' up how much we made? Don't interrupt. Now I gotta start addin' up all over again. Come on. Come on, Beam. Come on. You go too. Come on. You eat a good meal after all that work. There. Hey, just a minute now, Beam. Here. Here's some feed, Crowder. It's a good thing for you critters tonight's Saturday and I got a gal... or you'd still be hauling logs. What's the matter, Beam? Don't you think I got a gal? You got it reckoned? How much did I make? Well, as near as I can figure, Snug, you made yourself 114 bucks this week. You're crazy. That's the total. You still got your share comin'. Besides, we gotta pay for all that harness yet. You can hold mine, pal. I might get on another one of them spendin' sprees. Tony, you gotta have some money. I'm eatin' regular. It's okay with me. You ain't got the sense of a mule. But you got the heart of one. You goin' over to McGill's tonight? I ain't washin' my neck for you. Rad! Snug's here! - Hi, Snug. Be right down. - All right. She's been primpin' for an hour. I been tryin' to slick up too. Bean! Bedtime! - Oh, that child. - Mrs. McGill. Here's the five bucks I owe Roarer. I can pay more if he'd let me. I'd sure like to own them mules outright. I know. I spoke to him about it last week like you asked me. He wouldn't even listen. Them mules is a sore spot with him. He lies awake nights figurin' how he can even the score with you. Not a chance. I know. He'll get over it. Just happens he's still good and mad. He'd be even madder if he knew about me and Rad. He'd yell his head off, but I'm glad. - Well, here I am. - Well, gosh, you look cute. Go on. I bet he tells that to all the girls. Oh, not Snug. Rad, you know there's never been no one but you. Of course. I was only kidding. I've known all along. Bean! Where can that child be? - Have you seen her? - Not since suppertime, Ma. I think I'll go to bed. I need my rest. I noticed that. Here. Here's the five dollars from Snug. Hmm. I think I'll put the kitty to bed. Bean! Snug, I think you better get me home before it starts to rain. Well, we're closer to Tony's. We'll stop there till it blows over. Come on. Look! That's Stretch's skiff. Come on! Hey! Get out of there! Get out of there! Crowder! Crowder, get back! Back, Crowder! Tony, help him! Let him get himself out. He got himself in. Crowder! Move over! He tried to cripple him with a snare. Didn't quite work out, that's all. - Are you hurt bad? - I don't know. - Well, you get and get quick. - Tony! Now get this, Stretch. Snug ain't signed this complaint yet, but if you ever show your face around here again he will sign it... and you'll be a guest of the county for a long time afterwards. They're takin' an awful lot of stuff, Snug. Aw, leave 'em take everything that weren't nailed down, Sheriff. Don't like evictions as a rule, but this one done my heart good. I give 'em an hour to cross the county line. Believe me, they'll cross it. Yes, boys. That's the last you'll see of them. Where we goin' now, Snug? Right over to your place to tell your pa about us. - He won't like it. - Then he can lump it! Looks like your pa is stuck. And how he's stuck! Clean up to the axle. - Let's go try and help him out. - Come on, Crowder. Whoa. Ah, come on! Pull! Pull! Come on! I could kill the salesman... that sold me this bunch of... Hey! I'm stuck! Not as deep as your pa. Hiya, Roarer. Get off my land or I'll have you jailed for trespass! - You hear me? - What you doin', diggin' for oil? Kinda stuck, ain't ya? Stuck's what you'll be if you don't get. You too. Seems to me you ought to have more sense... than to drive a tractor across a plowed field after a heavy rain. The way you're fixed, Roarer, should this ground harden, it'll take dynamite to get you out. You're gonna lose a pile of money, Roarer, with no tractor. May even lose half a year's work. Get your neck over here where I can reach it. I'll show you who loses what. Want me to, uh, pull you out? You? You pull me out? - You and what? - Me and my mules. We could try. Think we could do it? I don't know. It weighs better than a couple of tons. I'll bet they can do it. So you think them mules can do what a 40-horsepower tractor can't? - Maybe. - If you was a growed man, Snug, and had the guts to make a real bet, I'm the one who'd bet ya plenty they can't do it. Like what? Snug, you still owe me for them mules and near a year's work to boot. Here's the bet I'll make ya. If them mules can pull my tractor out of the mud, you don't owe me nothin'... No work, no money, and they's all yours. There's two sides to every bet, Snug. Yeah. If they don't pull ya out? What then? Then them mules is mine to do with as I see fit. Go on, Snug. Take him up on it. They can do it. Take him up on it. Okay. If I take the bet and win, will you give me your leave to marry Rad? What gal with any sense would marry the likes of you? - I would, Pa. - And that's usin' good sense, Rad. Is it a bet? Yeah. It's a bet. I'll get my team. Come on, Rad. Say, I'd make you a little side bet of a bottle of bourbon... If I had a bottle! Can you see good? - We can! - Come on, team! Come on, Moonbeam. Whoa! Whoa, now! - Straight ahead lies solid ground. - Okay, Tony. - Stand aside, Roarer. - Well, you'll need my help, won't ya? Like heck I will. Stand aside and stay put. And see that you play fair 'cause there are folks over there... to bear me witness that'll run you out of church for the rest of your life. Oh... If you two don't get this out, I'm switchin' back to horses. You heard me. Well, it's up to you, Snug. I just give them a pep talk. Here we go. Come on! Heave! Hup! Hup! Keep it up now! Come on, Crowder! Hup! Hup! Heave, Crowder! Get out of there! Go, Snug! Moonbeam, Crowder! Hup! Hup! Come on, Beam! Come on, Crowder! Come on, Beam! Come on! Scudda hoo! Scudda hay! You look at them guys hit the ground! Scudda hoo! Scudda hay! You're hooked, Pa. There go your mules, your tractor and our gal. I told ya not to sell 'em, Pop. Well, heck, they're still in the family, ain't they?
