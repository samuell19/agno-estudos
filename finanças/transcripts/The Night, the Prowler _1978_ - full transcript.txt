(Felicity screams) - Oh, my God, something ghastly. Humphrey do you hear? (Felicity crying) Humph! - What? (Felicity crying) - Felicity. - Oh, my darling. (Doris groans) (Felicity crying) Coming Chi-Chi. (Felicity crying) For God's sake. What happened Chi-Chi? - Oh, oh, my darling, my baby. Tell Felicity, I can't believe. - Why not? - Was it a man? - Some thug climbed into my room. - Oh, my God. - He got into bed beside me. - Did he... Interfere with you? Chi-Chi? - At least you ought to be able to identify the brute after being so, so close. Did you have any conversation? - It was hardly a discussion group, mother. But we did talk. He had a knife. He forced me downstairs with it. He smoked a cigar. He wanted me to drink with him. - Daddy's good Napoleon. Can't you do something Humphrey? - One of these prowlers. Just now. Yes, my daughter. 22 Morton Drive. (doors close) (siren blares) Sorry to call you out at this time of night, but I would appreciate if you'd come, Frank. After what's happened, a doctor she knows will make all the difference. (siren blares) (tyres screech) - Daddy's thought of your dressing gown. Oh, dear, her slippers. You've forgotten her slippers. (doorbell rings) - Not the police. Official Darby, darling. I didn't expect, oh. - Mrs. Bannister. - So prompt, such a relief. First time ever I met a detective. (glass breaks) I hope they're trustworthy. - Well, they're police, aren't they? (cricket chirping) (door closes) (camera snaps) (clock ticking) (camera snaps) - Young fellow engaged to the daughter. - Trying to help you, Felicity, darling. - He made you drink with him, didn't he? You must have got a look at him then. - He was what you'd call well built, a very muscular man. Some people might think him handsome in a sort of ghastly way. His breath stank. - [Detective] What, grog? - Potato chips, fried in the cheapest oil. - Perhaps he mightn't have been able to afford better. - No, he mightn't. (engine idles) (door closes) (dog barks) - Brian! Pete! What are you doing out there? Come in at once, do you hear? - What happened to this knife? - He took it, I guess. It was his wasn't it? (doorbell rings) - Must be Dr. Herborn. Frank, what a night, you don't know what I've been through. - How's Chi-Chi? - Cool considering, but that's Felicity, you can't tell. Glad to have a doctor she knows. Not just someone the police produce. - Only for formality, Chi-Chi. It'll soon be over. - Oh. (clock ticks) (dramatic music) (bird squawks) (clock chimes) - I wonder if Felicity's remembered her slippers. - Never gave orchids a go myself. Too tricky. Staghorns is what I fancy. - Charming. (clock ticking) - Felicity refuses to be examined. - What's her reason? - Well, she says she not a child. She feels she'll be humiliated. - What have I done to deserve such a perverse daughter. - Thanks, Frank. (birds chirping) It would be nice if we could come to an arrangement, keep it from the press. - Police aren't always the guilty party, Mr. Banister. No matter what the press tells you. (bird whistling) (lock clicks) (door closes) (birds whistling) (door squeaks) - Humphrey. (birds chirping) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) Madge, darling. Yes, I know it's later than usual, but you can't imagine what I've been through. Hardly a wink, but Dr. Herborn left a pill. Yes, well, I'll tell you Madge in strictest confidence because you know Humphrey. Quite hysterical. She'd woken to find someone beside her in her bed. One of the prowlers who break into girls' bedrooms, some psychologically deranged person. A man, Madge. Felicity found a man in her bed. - [Madge] No. - Yes. (Madge speaks indistinctly) I could hardly bring myself to say it. He raped my little Felicity (cries). - [Madge] Oh, God. - [Doris] And forced her to drink with him. And was threatening her with the vilest language. All at the point of the knife. Dr. Herborn was such a comfort, brought her into the world, you know. But one of the detectives was such a charming little fellow. He grows staghorns. - [Madge] What? - Ferns dear. As a hobby. And the other detective, for some reason, probably political, not on our side. Madge, dear, you will be discreet. Humphrey would never forgive me. (Madge speaks indistinctly) John hasn't been told. And who should tell him? Who will make it seem less ugly. After all, he can only be an immense shock to the psyche of even a sophisticated young man to hear a month from the wedding that his bride has been raped. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Madge. Oh, I am sorry. It's horrid when you upset it on the sheets. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Humphrey shouldn't attempt to tell. I mean, two men plunging around such a delicate situation might end up making it seem vulgar. I began to think in the course of the night, I might tell John myself. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Such a splendid relationship between us during their long engagement. Yes, I know, these long engagements, but he was so firm about sparing her the climate when he was appointed to Jakarta. As soon as he heard he was to be posted somewhere else. - [Madge] But where? - We don't know where, not officially, but I have it from somebody high up they're making him first secretary in Rome. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Now this dreadful thing. At this point in his career. - [Madge] Oh, but darling. - Yes, Madge. - [Madge] It isn't unheard of today. - I know there's all this sleeping around nowadays, but I'm pretty sure Felicity was chaste. She's my child. In many ways we're so alike. (Doris screams) Felicity tell. Oh, Madge, I'm not old-fashioned, but a young girl would feel embarrassed. Something fell. - Who was that? - Madge Hopkirk. - I hope you've left nothing to that woman's discretion. Nothing she can make the worst of. - Poor loyal old Madge, you've always been jealous of her. Aren't you going to the office, dear? You know how you hate it when others don't rise to their responsibilities. - Yes. (bird chirping) (Humphrey cries) - Darling, this won't help Felicity. (door slams) - That's her. - It's garbage day, Humphrey. Did you remember to put the bin out? - I reckon Mrs. Pompford told her not to expect her at work. She sprained an ankle. I just wish John wasn't such a decent sort of a bloke. It'd mean less to a man with a touch of the shyster in him. - Oh, dear, virginity isn't a sheet of iron. - Was in my day. - Virginity's no longer fashionable. A man isn't all the impressed by his girl following the fashion. - I expect it will bring them closer together. They'll try harder to please each other. Where are your slippers, darling? You might catch cold, mightn't you. - I don't think so. - Would you like me to boil you an egg? Or grill you a kidney? There's such a nice looking kidney. - You know I don't eat breakfast. - Yes, but I just thought you might be hungry. - Peck, peck. The office. - What I'd do if I were you, I'd take myself to the hairdresser. I'd treat myself to everything, facial, manicure, the works. It will do you the world of good, dear. - [Felicity] I don't need good done to me. - [Doris] I'm only thinking of your happiness, darling. Cover yourself up, dear. There is something I've thought and thought about and failed to understand. - [Felicity] I haven't meant to upset you, Mummy. - But why, why wouldn't you let kind old Dr. Herborn examine you? - I know, I know. - Apart from anything else, it makes us all look so ridiculous. I could see that nasty little detective laughing up his sleeve. If they catch the beastly pervert we shan't have a case, don't you see? - I know, I know. Think we're going to catch him? - Well, there's every chance of catching the man. You described him so vividly, horridly. And then to refuse our own doctor. - Don't you understand it was bad enough without having a doctor messing around? - [Doris] But darling, what if there are consequences? - I'm not so helpless I can't deal with consequences. - Daddy was so upset by your strange behaviour. You know what you mean to him. - Daddy? My virginity means more to him than anything else about me. Thank God I'm rid of the rotten thing. - I can't believe, Felicity. 340 You're the girl Daddy and I brought up. - I know, it's unbelievable. - You agreed to marry an honourable man like John. - John's so honourable, so kind, so perfect. I couldn't live up to him. I've been writing to him this morning. (dishes clank) - What have you written? Felicity! While your mind's disturbed? - I've written breaking off the engagement. For a number of reasons, the least of them being the loss of Daddy's old virginity. (Doris crying) (women laughing) - Oh, such a lovely lunch. - Oh, yes, Doris. - Delicious souffle Doris. - Loyal old mess. - Well, it was, it was super. - Humphrey thinks I've got too good an opinion of myself. - Bugger Humphrey. - I've taken to making a souffle with pistachios. - With what? - Pistachio nuts. - Oh, exotic you. Give me grated Bodalla. Nothing to get under the gums. - Divine old salver, is it Georgie? - Solid silver. - Wedding present from Hump's business partner. - Lovely. - Brilliant of you darling to think of living at Centennial Park. - Don't you find it far too far. - Too far from what? - Oh, from us, of course. - It's a godsend if you've got children. - Oh, give her time, for God's sake. - Shame they never cut the grass. Tough on the mothers. - What do you expect with the men all away? - That's correct. Where's yours? - [Doris] New Guinea. - Mine's Middle East. Air Force. At least the Yanks have livened things up since I come. - Have they? (baby cries) - Stop that crying, I'll lay into you. What to buy nowadays without she has a candy. - Expecting another? - [Woman] Looks like it, don't it? - I bet your husband will be pleased. - You never know with Stan. He's a difficult joker. Gonna take a snap. - Take one every week, send to her father. Keeps us close. (ducks quacking) (camera snaps) (camera snaps) (people chattering) Ooh, my bag. Oh, bye. - Is this really Felicity? - No one else. There we are. (birds chirping) Don't think she's happy with the way I'm holding her. Don't seem to have the right touch. Oughten you to take her back. - Remember, darling, your Daddy's, too. Otherwise, Mummy shan't be happy. (Felicity giggling) - Daddy and Chi-Chi have had their lovely time. Now Mummy's turn to do the hard work, there. (engine idles) (birds chirping) - Hey, what's this, an ambush. Hey, steady on Chi-Chi. (clock ticking) - Worst humidity this summer. Must have been a ghastly day. - It was that all right. Oh! - I'm sure Daddy's too tired and hot to have a heavy girl on his chest. - What got into you Chi-Chi. You nearly winded me. - Did you hear me, Felicity. - Ah! What have we got here? Little tiger. - Oh, how horrid. What a nasty little girl. Did she hurt you, darling? - Not exactly. - Run at once, Felicity and fetch daddy's special pencil. I hope you'll never do such a vicious thing again. (Humphrey laughs) - [Felicity] Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. - [Doris] There she goes. If you don't run up and kiss her goodnight, we'll get no peace. (clock ticking) - How's me girl? Got a kiss for me? Well, if you're stingy, I'm not, mm. Full of surprises. - It's tigress. - It's what? What a funny little thing you are. (children chattering) - Bye Lee. - Bye Wendy. - See you tomorrow, bye. (whimsical music) (clock ticking) - [Humphrey] Do you think Felicity's happy? - Well, why not? She's got everything a girl could wish for. - [Humphrey] She doesn't speak to us anymore. - Girls don't at her age. They like to have secrets together. Actually, Felicity hasn't got many friends. That's because we've always been so close as a family. Felicity. Felicity. (Doris knocks) Felic. Felicity. (Doris knocks) - [Felicity] Hmm? - What are you doing, dear? - Having a read. - Oh, but dearest, it's so unhealthy. I mean stuffy in there when you have your nice airy room. (toilet flushes) - Of course it'd be rather an expense, but we feel we have to grin and bear it seeing as she's 16. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Hail Primrose. Yes, Madge, I cut it out myself and I'm letting her wearing a string of my pearls. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Japanese lanterns through the garden. And Humphrey's hiring, I believe you call it a combo. (Madge speaks indistinctly) (Doris laughs) (drums beat) (Latin music) - Now boys, we mustn't waste the music, must we? (Latin music) - Everyone seems to be having a good time. - Poor little bastards. Not a very promising lot. - All from good addresses nonetheless. (Latin music) (boy whistles) - Any of you young things feel like a spot of fruit cup? - Okay, Mr. Bannister, I'll give your fruit cup a go. (girls laughing) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Felicity ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (guests clapping) ♪ Why was she born so beautiful ♪ ♪ Why was she born at all ♪ ♪ Because she had no say in it ♪ ♪ No say in it at all ♪ - Keeping clean and pure for the man who'll eventually put all his faith in a girl. Do you understand me, Felicity? Because to the right man, Felicity, a girl probably means even more than she does to her parents. (clock ticking) (bird chirping) - Oh, darling. You skin might be scarred forever. What an age it takes to blunder through the lumpish years. - The chrysalis stage. Gives me the itch just to think about it. - What I meant to say, what I think we have to face, Felicity is a lumpy girl. - Yes, but time often irons out the lumps. (birds chirping) (gentle harp music) - I don't suppose you could call it conversation, but she sometimes tells us what is marvellous and what is ghastly. - Well, to distinguish between marvellous and ghastly, if that isn't conversing, what is it? (gentle harp music) (birds chirping) (gate squeaks) Radiant young woman. - Thank you, Madge. Maura Pompford tells me she's indispensable in the shop. - This red, flame if you prefer it, is really rather gorgeous. - Oh, I'd never dare. I don't think I'm secure enough. He'd never stop ragging me about red. - Perhaps he wouldn't notice if you didn't draw his attention to it. (toys crashing) (children cheering) - Good with people. She understands their psychology. She gets that from me I think. They adore her in the neighbourhood. - Looks like it's going to, Felicity. - Is it? I expect it will, if you say so Mr. Darrell. - Oh. - Hello Chi-Chi. A bit nippy. - Yes. - Lovely day. - Heard about the job, Chi-Chi, how's it going? - Good thanks, Mrs. Burtson. - Now we finally got to find Mr. Right and we'll be really off to the races. - Department of External Affairs. (Madge speaks indistinctly) - Yes, Madge. Between posts. John never mentions it, but I know from a reliable source, the Prime Minister has taken him up. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Oh, I shan't presume to hope, time will show. No, she hasn't given me a single clue. I wouldn't ask. Felicity is a girl of delicate sensibility. (Madge speaks indistinctly) That letter from John this morning, was it to say he's coming? - [Felicity] He did say he'd be in Sydney this week. - But he'll be more precise surely? - [Felicity] I think so. He wants to see us. (door closes) (sewing machine clatters) - But such a charming and in every way desirable young man. - Well, isn't it Felicity's business to decide. - Ah, such lack of enthusiasm. But you must surely be a little bit fond. All those letters he writes to you. You must both be fond. - We could be pen friends, couldn't we. (clock ticking) - Always so much enjoyed our little talks. - Thank you. - That wretched girl. She have must have been held up at work. But you'll stay, won't you? There's a perfectly canard au douillet prepared by my own hands. - Sorry, I'm dining with a chap who's leaving for Rome. - Oh, dear. She will be disappointed. Tomorrow perhaps? - Oh, I've got to be back. - In Canberra, so cold. Empty, I've always found. (gate squeaks) Of course there are the lovely trees, but one can't live with trees alone. Not indefinitely anyway. Darling. I'll leave you two together. Otherwise my duck will be a disaster. Well, perhaps you'll change your mind? - Change, how? - You'll stay and try my canard au douillet (laughs). (door closes) - What's the cure for pins and needles? - Walk on it. - My practical Felicity. - What did he say? - Say? He said the trees are already turning in Canberra. (clock ticking) (whimsical music) (bird chirping) (dog barking) - Ooh, lovely, lovely taste. - Right, Chi-Chi, congratulations. (crickets chirping) (orchestral music) (crickets chirping) - What about my call to Sydney, operator? Got it. Good, good. Hello, is that you, darling? Hello? Felicity? I got your letter, darling. Yes, well, it's frightful. Well, I can't, I won't talk about it on the phone. I'll be with you tomorrow. Early start. What's it like? The weather? Steamy. It's pretty chilly in Canberra. (water splashes) (birds chirping) (bell rings) (dramatic music) - I know John will be understanding. Hadn't you better dress, dear? He ought to be here any minute. (horn blowing) - That old rag. And barefoot. Felicity! Felicity! Felicity! (door closes) Oh! (engine idles) - Now, darling, we can talk the sense we don't write in the heat of the moment. - That's why I come down here so that we can talk sensibly without interruptions. (engine revs) - Lovely day. (upbeat band music) - The chef at the Brazilian embassy's buying the car. - Is he paying you a good price? - Not good enough. But I'm lucky to get out of it so likely. And I've looked it up in the Astor Martin. - Yes, you've looked it up. The Astor Martin's an extravagance, of course but it was what you wanted. I wonder what you'll get in Rome to replace it? - That's for you to half decide. You can't imagine, can you, that anything, that whatever happened can make any difference to us Felicity. Darling? I mean, you don't imagine that I love you less. - Yes, I know. - Then I take it you consider the letter you wrote is as unreasonable as I do, but you felt you had to write it. - I had to write it. - In case I was the kind of bastard who might want to go back on an agreement. - I knew you'd keep your word, John. I just suddenly felt that I mightn't be able to keep mine. I found I didn't love you in the way you expect me to. - But if you love me. - Yes, I love you, only it isn't what I expected of love. - Did this man's lust make it so clear? - No, it wasn't his lust. I don't think it was anything that happened between us. Only the fact that it happened and I had no part in it. - But surely the thing about marriage is that two people do take part in it. - They can. Sometimes one of them doesn't, as in a rape. - I can't see the analogy. - So I had to break the engagement. - Is there anything we should do? Anything formal, I mean? To show that it's off. - I don't think so. I'll tell my mother. Otherwise, I guess you just let it fade out. - Well, if that's how you feel, Felicity, I'll be only too happy to do whatever you want. (engine revs) (upbeat band music) - Thank you, darling. (gate squeaks) (engine revs) (door closes) - What have you done to me? - But I'm the one who was engaged? - I can only say Felicity you've done something wicked and perverse. Why I wonder do you want to destroy us? - Why? Why! If knew the answers, but I don't. I'm not the record you'd like to play. (phone dialing) (phone rings) (Madge speaks indistinctly) - No, Madge. I consider it immoral not to answer the phone when I'm here. - [Madge] Am I interrupting? - No, you're interrupting nothing, just a few little routine chores. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Of course dear, I'll be glad to hear it if you really feel you have to tell. (Madge speaks indistinctly) Another young man. Well, Madge, if it's only another, if Felicity were with the same awful young man, we might have something to worry about. I know some of her friends are of doubtful character and since she left her good job with Maura Pompford. Went to work at this place, this boutique or old clothes shop. I'm sure there's no significance in the name. It's only a silly tasteless joke. Everyone is tasteless nowadays. (Madge speaks indistinctly) If she's a bit different, it's the set she runs around with. (Madge speaks indistinctly) And because- Yes, she has changed since. Whether she's happy? Really, Madge, I'm too discreet to ask her. I've learned my lesson. I must go now, dear. Something's boiling over, I can smell it. (clock ticking) (birds chirping) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (clock chimes) (Humphrey snoring) - Felic. Felic. (crickets chirping) (airplane roars) - [Humphrey] A tendency to disapproval is all you've inherited from us, do you see? - What's this, Felic? - Oh, that's my sharp knife. I carry it for emergencies. (funky music) - [Man] Felicity! (people chanting) (gentle music) - I'm connecting again. What's this? - It's a lump of lava. - Geez, Lis, a sharp knife, a lump of bloody lava. What do you add up to. (sitar music) (dramatic music) (zipper clicking) (light clicks) (clock ticking) (lock clicks) (crickets chirping) (owl hooting) (airplane soars) (dramatic music) (airplane soars) (clock ticking) (clock chimes) (clock ticking) (bowl chimes) (light clicks) (light clicks) (light clicks) (lighter flickers) (Felicity coughs) (bottle clanks) (light clicks) (Felicity coughs) (gong bangs) (dramatic music) (Felicity grunts) - The real Harvey. Soft fool. (suspenseful music) (glass breaks) God, I look a starving imbecile. My sharp knife. I carry it for emergencies. (tense music) (suspenseful music) Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. (Felicity moans) (suspenseful music) (body thuds) - What do you expect to get, crawling in like some kind of insect and so bloody clumsy, huh. What? Even if I wanted you, you wouldn't have been capable. You're too mingy. - Come on. What's your game? - No game. (body thuds) You stink of rancid chips. Is this the knife you slashed them with? - Oh, go on, you win. - Nobody's won. That's the depressing part of it. - Never touch a drop meself. - Just a mouthful. This is an unusual occasion. You don't smoke either, I expect. - That's correct. - Then I can't invite you to celebrate in any way? - What are you going to do with me? If you're going to call them, then let's get it over with. And I'd like to say I've got a wife and a couple of kids. We adopted them. Two little girls. - Not girls. - Well, the wife thought they'd be less trouble. They could help with the laundry and washing up. - You're not going to tell me the story of your life. I couldn't bear it. I don't expect anything - of you or anybody. (clock ticking) (door opens) (crickets chirping) (door closes) (clock ticking) (clock chimes) (Felicity blows) (Felicity moans) - For God's sake. (Felicity crying) What happened to you? - Our darling, our baby, oh. (siren blaring) (tyres screech) - What happened to his knife? - He took it I guess. It was his, wasn't it? - You could have hung on to your knave of clubs. - Well I didn't. - You're telling me. (woman screams) (suspenseful music) Help, help, help. (woman screams) (woman crying) - Bloody bastards. (woman crying) - A mob of filthy communists. (bird chirping) - What are you putting in this time? - Portulaca. - I should have known. Don't you get tired of them? - They're reliable, Chi-Chi. - A couple I know, Harvey Macon, got burgled the other day. Burgled's hardly the right word. They don't seem to have taken a thing. Anyway, whatever the motive, a gang of thugs broke in and practically wrecked the place (laughs). Good luck to them. Harvey was always a smooth self-satisfied sod. His house the kind of mausoleum that asks for rape. Matter of fact, that's how the papers referred to it. - I wouldn't have expected you to feel as you do about a brutal and uncalled for act. I thought your standards were different. - Nobody's flawless. As you've discovered. I'm surprised you didn't recognise the old portulaca. - [Felicity] Insignificant little things. - They have their unexpected moments. (birds chirping) (alarm blaring) (dramatic music) (gate clanks) (birds chirping) - I can't understand why so many men between them don't catch this maniac prowler. One practical woman - - Would solve the problem in two shakes. - A woman would exert herself to catch the man who's humiliating her sex. Perhaps it isn't a man. - Threatening, raping young girls. How could it be anything else? - You make me sick. - I'm terribly sorry, darling, if I was tactless. Is everything ... you're not unwell I hope. - Yes. No! I think I'm probably only suffering from the passive nature that you've forced on me. (door slams) - Moods. (birds chirping) (crickets chirping) (tense music) - What are you after? What do you want? If it's money, there's a few notes and some silver on the dressing table. - It isn't money. - Go on, shan't tell the cops. - I'll see you later. (sound of footsteps) (grand orchestral music) - If we play along with crypto communists, that is what we've got to expect. - I must confess, Sir Roland, I once met a rather divine commo. Gas fitter. Came to blow the pipes and stayed on to indoctrinate. - Really, Madge. Can't I tempt you, Sir Roland, with a smoked oyster. - How's the Mercedes going, Bernie? - Having trouble with the battery. - Oh, give it a bang with a hammer, old boy. It never fails. - She was wearing one of those Moroccan outfits. (crickets chirping) (grand orchestral music) (guest chattering) - Darling. So glad you were able to join us. You know quite a lot of us - Madge, of course. And Mrs. Birdstall. - No need to introduce Chi-Chi and I. We know each other from way, way back. - [Doris] Oh. Jill Pegly you'll know. Patti, of course. - Hi, Felicity. - [Together] Hello. - [Doris] Lady Duddleston. Sir, Roland Duddleston. - Who? - [Doris] Our daughter, Felicity. - Oh, charming. Charming. - What would you like to drink, Chi-Chi? - [Felicity] A glass of water. - May I fetch it for you? - Times have changed. - In the old days, on the Orient line, it was white ladies every night for most of the girls. - I admire your strength of character, my dear. - Strength. - Well, aren't you into health foods, too? - No. (guests chattering) (upbeat music) (people talking indistinctly) (guest laughing) - That's about the bluest I've heard. - I don't know about blue, love, but that's life, isn't it? - Who is it? - A neighbour. Nobody can say I'm not democratic. - Oh, but darling. How unreasonable they can be. (door closes) (clock ticking) (guests laughing) (tense music) (gentle music) (clock ticking) - [Doris] What on earth? - I'm going for a walk in the park. - I can't believe. At this time of night? - Truly. - But never at night Felicity. Only drunkards, cutthroats, perverts. Nobody in their right mind. Not even a trained athlete would cross the park after sundown. Felicity! Felicity! (suspenseful music) - You have no idea how them nuns made me suffer at Our Lady o' Mercy. Dear me. No mercy there. I'd never have believed there was bitches and nuns, as well as women. And it all begun with a safety pin I used to keep the draft out of the rear end of me underwears. - You'll light up if you don't lay off. - Sister Mary Perpetua. Sister Perpetual I called her (laughs). Didn't I tell you? Maybe I didn't. Perhaps it wouldn't mean anything to someone who'd never had any experience of a bloody amateur from Cunnamulla, Queensland. (gentle music) Cunnamulla, kiss the bloody, exit. (gentle music) - Got a surprise for you lovey. - What surprise? Go on, you're not serious. - Honest to God, lovey. I got a real surprise if you allow me to come on down. - Keep it till morning and look it over and see if you were right. (man laughs) - Night after night, Madge. You'd swear she had assignation. (Madge speaks indistinctly) - [Madge] Have you told Humphrey. - No, I haven't told Humphrey. You know what men are, Humphrey in particular. (tense music) (woman laughing) - You won't know the meaning of it! - I'll have you arrested. Any one of your sort is a menace to the community. - Like hell I am! Get wise to yourself! (tense music) Hey youse! Perhaps we got something to say to each other. We don't know till we find out whether we don't see eye to eye. Hey youse! (gentle music) (singing in a foreign language) Tell me what you're singing about. - It's a song about one love. - Fair enough. - About loins. - Yes. - It's about a man who open up her ... her body. And plants stones where heart not be. - Those are the silly words of a song. The heart is in anybody. Only waiting to be tored into by somebody big enough to perform the bloody act. And fuck you God for holding out on me (cries). (geese squawking) (bird fluttering) (gate squeaks) (dog barks) What are you doing in there? - Living. At any rate, this is what they call live. (rat squeals) (flies buzzing) (man coughs) - You're not very well covered. - Left clothes sometime back. Less trouble without. If you want to scratch yourself or pee or if anybody comes to the door they go away and leave you alone. - That's all very well. Must be somebody, though. Somebody who comes? Somebody you want to see you at your best? - This is my best. There isn't anybody now. Not since they got what they wanted. I gave that away about the same time as the clothes. And the prostate. (door clatters) I just lay here thinking of the days when I could still enjoy a piss and stools came easy. You find out that's the two most important things in life. I could honestly say I've never expected anything of anyone. I never loved, not even myself. It's just more than can be said of most people. I'm nothing. I believe in nothing. Nothing is a noble state. Nobody can hurt nothing. So you've no reason to be afraid. (blinds crash) - I am afraid. There must be something I can do for you. Something I can show you. This light for instance. - Rats have got that cheeky. They sit up and watch a bloke in the daylight. - Not if you let me stay. At least I can keep the rats at bay. You needn't expect more of me than you ever did of anybody. - No rats. And an easy pee. - Well. It's something, isn't it? (bird squawking) (tense music) (gentle music) (music builds) (water dripping) (engine revs) (gentle music) (horn blows) I don't know. - What age would you say? - Don't know. Very old. - And you say he was nothing to you? You never ever seen him before? - Never, but I sort of knew him. I knew him as I know myself.
