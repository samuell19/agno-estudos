Mister. I'm so sorry, but this is all I have now. I promise to wire the rest in the morning. No. No way! You know how many times I fell for that? No way!　-But I'm an honest person. You know where I live, and I'll transfer the money first thing in the morning. I said no! You don't have 10 bucks? But the meter's still running. Well, I'm not paid yet. Please sir. Help me out. If you can't pay in 10 minutes, I'm going to the cops. What rotten luck. （My brother）. You should've called before. 10 bucks... You're something else. Hungry? I ate. Want some fried chicken? I'm fine, but if you want some... Don't tell mom. It'll only upset her. Oh right. I need a favor. What? You know "Dark Life"? The play?　-Yeah. I passed the first round of auditions. Really?　-Yeah. So I need something choreographed for round 2. Help me out. So, feminine movements, like a transgender woman? That's what you need? Well, not necessarily. The play is more about pain. Femininity and pain. So I'm hoping you can capture both aspects. All right. But what about your competition? I finish practicing at 4:00 Wednesday and Thursday. Come to school then.　-Okay. Don't they want famous actors? Isn't the director someone big? Kim Tae-baek is directing. The filmmaker?　-Yeah. June! Oh, hey. Long fucking time no see. I was just chilling with my brother. Damn! He's a looker. Better than you. So you... you work here? Me? I'm just helping an old friend. What about you? What are you up to? The same, still acting. Really?　-Yeah. What're you working on? A few projects. What projects? What now? Right now, auditioning. For what? "Dark Life." Yeah, it's good to audition for everything. But fuck, isn't that aiming too high? Um, we were discussing something... Yeah, I think your brother should try acting. And isn't it time for you to find something else? If you refuse to give up, you're a burden on other people! Right, little bro? What do you think? Does your brother have any chance as an actor? Look, we have something urgent to discuss here. Hey, when did we perform last? 2008? 2009? Did you play the count, or did I? You did...　-Right. Delivery boy!　-Huh? You guys eat up and have a good chat. I'll be back.　-Okay. What the hell are you doing? Let me know if you need anything. Okay. I'll be back in a flash! Fuck. What a piece of shit. We acted together. He always was an ass. What can I do? Should I fight him? And end up back at the station? Is he really worth it? I'm going to make sure you get that part. Here. You kidding me? Good for you. Smoke, and I'll kill you. What the hell? Eat up. Look, LOST TO SHAME I'm human too. This world is nothing but tragedy. Can you really say what we shared isn't love? Can you? She passed away 3 years ago. Sometimes I feel guilty for how I treated her. I miss her a lot. Wanting nothing more than to be accepted as a woman by her mother, in the end she had to let her go. Her life has been one of loneliness and pain. Hey. Hey! Yes? Got a light? Oh, here. What are you doing? What? What are you up to? I'm meeting someone. Gimme your phone. Why? You wanna die? Huh? Hurry the fuck up. Why? You filming me? No I wasn't! Bullshit! Let's go to the cops. No, wait. I'm sorry. Actually, I'm an actor. Have you heard of the play "Dark Life"? That play, it's about sexual minorities, and the pain they face... I know. What? Kim Tae-baek. Right! I'm auditioning for that play. At first I just memorized the lines they gave me. But when I said them, it sounded so fake. So I tried looking for some documentaries, and then... I saw you on one, and I ended up coming here. So I arrived and there you were, walking around. I was so happy to see you, it seemed like fate. But I deeply apologize for filming without permission. I was driven by only my goal to give a truthful performance. I'll delete it right away. Holy fuck. Huh? Nothing. I'll delete it right away. What's your name? Oh Song-jun. Come with me. Hey, sister. Just sit here. Okay. Come here. Come on. Come on. What'll it be? A tequila. Tequila?　-Yes. Here, it's on the house. Thank you. So with every move, focus on your breathing. And what's next most important? Feel your muscles inside you. Feel them! So, what's next? How's it going? Remember that lady I told you about? From Itaewon. She's done everything she can to help me. I really don't know how to thank her. Ace the audition. Easier said than done. The odds are 500 to one. Where do all these actors come from, anyway? Use that feeling there. What? That hunger to be recognized... Isn't it similar to how that character feels? I don't get it. What I mean is, "We're good at acting," "but no one ever gives us a shot." That's what we used to say every night while drinking. Right. Same with that character in the play. "There's nothing wrong with me," "but the fucking world hates me." Approach it like that, and you'll have a chance. You're a genius. Really. It's starting to make sense. Hey. What's up? Hello, teacher. How's it going? What did you call him? We're in school. So how's he doing? He's the opposite of you. The opposite? You suck at school? I don't have much time. Okay, shall we start? Goodbye, teacher.　-See you. I'll call you.　-Okay. Sorry, I know you're busy. What are brothers for? Wow! That's amazing! I said I'd give you something good. Can I really pull this off?　-You can. Let's try it. With a slightly feminine feeling. One, two, three... You call your love beautiful, but what I do is dirty? New shoes? Yeah.　-They look warm. Want them? More like a woman at the end. Don't look at me, look in the mirror! Skip that part. He shed hot blood for me, he froze to death for me. Can you say what we shared isn't love? Like you want to fly free! Good luck with your audition. This'll be my treat. What'll it be? What's snapper? A fish with big teeth. The world is nothing but tragedy. Charles. Why was I even born? Now I just want to escape this tragedy. Can you really say what we shared isn't love? I'm human, too. Is what I do dirty? Look! As you all can see, this man... We are one and the same. Oh Song-jun? Get ready, you're next. I'm human, too.　-It's not my fault! I didn't choose to be born this way. Can you call it anything but true love? Is what I do dirty? How'd it go? Not bad. I'm losing my voice. What about you? I fucking nailed it. Cool. But I'll never get it. Why not? For being honest. What do you mean? Do you understand sexual minorities? It's not about understanding, is it? I just think it's wrong, so I told them. Really? You can't accept them? Nope. But you auditioned? Well, that's different. I thought I'd try seeing things from their side. That's something. Let's go. Come on. What are you waiting for? Okay. Yes! Food's here. Hello? Yes? Oh, hello. Yes. Multi-task! Oh, really? Yes, of course. Thank you very much. Yes, goodbye. Hey! What is it? I got it. Dark Life. It's your turn. Stop bullshitting. Wait a second. What's this? What the fuck? Bro. It's me. I got Dark Life. Yeah, they picked me! Oh, let me talk to him! Hello? I'm in Dark Life! Sure, let's meet up! I'm with Ji-hoon now. Is that Woo-jae? Want to talk to him? Call me right back! Yeah. Oh my god! Look at you, grinning from ear to ear. But you know, I knew he'd get it. Taking lessons every day from his brother. He's hardcore. You're lucky to have that brother. Or maybe he's lucky to have me. Anyway, fucking congrats man. Fucking thanks. Hell yeah. Congratulations. After all my efforts, things are looking up. Let's drink to that. This is on me.　-Of course! I mean it. Really? I'm walking home. Then let's order more! Whatever you want! Sure. This is a once in a lifetime chance. It sure is, that cheapskate! Congrats again, man. What if Woo-jae had auditioned? I think he'd have gotten it. - That's right. - He seems cut out for that role. He's a good actor. Sure he is. Why not make a comeback, Juliet? No thanks, Romeo. That's what I'm talking about. Easy for you to say. Now you've got it made. What? Damn! That's just not normal. How do you carry that around? Armed and dangerous, this guy. Stop it, you actors. Drink up! Come on. Sorry, but we're closing. You have to go.　-Sorry. We'll go now. Sorry. Hey. You know what your problem is? You're fake. You said you can't understand them? Sure. It's a mental illness! A mental illness? Nothing strange about that. We all have them! It's a gender issue, not a mental illness. So sleeping with kids or family members or animals... That's not the same. - Where's the fucking line? - You're just ignorant, man. Shut up and drink. It comes naturally to them. Your anus is to let shit out, not to put stuff in. Don't go around saying that. You'll get your ass kicked. It's a human rights issue.　-Stop. Fuck. Cool it. Human rights? Human rights? The whole world is going insane. Legal protection? Well, then... The army, boys schools, they'll be dating hotspots! What if it's all legalized and becomes the norm. Can you love another man? No! Exactly! It's not the law. It's something you're born with. No it isn't. It could happen to me too. Really?　-Yeah. Then you're gay. Fuck you.　-Anyway it's not wrong, it's just different. I'm just talking differently from you. Fuck, am I wrong? It's fundamentally different. When black people were... Fuck, human rights again! Well... In that case... Cut it out. Woo-jae, it's a mental illness, right? So you're saying I'm nuts? A mental patient? Don't talk nonsense! I'm gay. What are you... You fucking serious? Yeah. Since when? Sorry. I was going to tell you first. But it wasn't easy. Didn't know how you'd take it. Woo-jae. I don't know about you, but you're my only friend. I don't care if you're gay or a murderer, you're still my buddy. But you're a little disappointed? No, not because of that. But I'm pissed you didn't tell me sooner. Really pissed. You don't have a crush on me? I'm kidding. I can only imagine how hard it must have been for you. So you were wrong not to tell me. I'm sorry. Me too. But you know, even if I were a girl, I wouldn't be interested. I'm off. One more for the road? Got class tomorrow. Anyway, sorry again. See ya. Bye. June! June! Ina!　-Thank you. No. Thank you. Congratulations. For you. You shouldn't have. I'll buy you a better one later. So it's no good? Here. Where are we? You'll see. Come on. It's already started, so just watch from the back. Okay. You always do fine. Let's go. So I won't be here for a while. I need to stop by there. Let's all go! Go where? Yisul's in the hospital. What happened? An operation gone wrong. Oh no. I know. Which hospital? Gangnam.　-Gangnam? Let's go today. Sure, join us. Let's go. Say hi, this is my friend June. Hello. I'm Oh Song-jun. Look at you flirting already! There's nothing wrong with kissing in public, right? I did nothing wrong, but people kept glaring at us. So that made us go at it even more. Then this guy starts swearing at me. "Mister, you're a fucking freak!" I'm not a mister anymore. I had to respond, so I swore back at him. Oopsies, I'm speaking dialect again. So I yelled at him. "Hey asshole! I'm a girl," "but my dick's bigger than yours!" Something like that. "Would I get aroused" "if I kissed a man while drunk?" I know for sure that I would. So the people in front of me are saying that, then it's my turn. And I want to try it with this guy I've had a crush on. Our lips were almost touching, when suddenly, he said he just couldn't do it. Oh, that's harsh. Shall we start? I open my eyes and tell you. I feel like I'm born again. Gazing at the moon, you ask. It feels like it's looking just at me. Why is it that I must disappear? I'm alive and breathing, but why do I feel dead? Dawn arrives and tells me it's okay. In the morning, I see myself in the mirror. Thanks. You liked it? I didn't see you as the musical type. Thought you were more of a jock. Just kidding... Music helped me rediscover myself. How was the gathering? Did you have fun? Were you uncomfortable?　-No, not at all. I had a great time. That's a relief. Then come every week, okay? We need hotties like you to keep up our energy. Wanna hear another one? This was my first song. When I was a virgin. （Oh Song-jun cast in Dark Life.） （ "A monstrous talent"） （Oh Song-jun beats 1000:1） （odds to star as Judy）. What do you know anyway? Go ahead and call me crazy. Nice work, brother. This is just the beginning. You should quit. You're a lead actor. Okay, I'll smoke this one and quit. How many do you have left? Hey! Fine, I quit. I still can't believe it. You owe me dinner.　-Sure, no problem. （Oh Song-jun / Judy）. Hello! Hello, I'm Oh Song-jun. You got here early.　-Yes. Hi, I'm Nam So-min. The AD. You can call me NamSo. Okay. I'm Director Kim Tae-baek. Song-jun, I'm so glad you'll be playing Judy. I'm so grateful you gave this opportunity to someone like me. No no, I'm the grateful one. Just a moment.　-OK. Let me get ready. Sure. Please have a seat here. OK. Thank you. You almost didn't get the role. What? Holy fuck, the pressure from the higher-ups was insane! It's such a good play, and a huge chance for new actors. Management companies were calling like crazy. And the nutheads in the production company were screaming. But our Director was so cool. He's like, without Song-jun, I'm not doing this play. Boom! Really? He was so fucking awesome. Kim Tae-baek just rules, fucking end of story! Anyway, during the audition he fell for you at first sight. Better watch your butt.　-What? Just kidding. Anyway, I just hope everyone in this play gives it their all. You're quite a character. Good. Let's do this! Kim Tae-baek sure has an eye for talent. What are you saying? I want to live as a woman. I love putting on makeup. I love men. 1, 2, 3, 4. Good. When you go down here, hold your head up. More. Your butt. Bravo! Wow! What? Hey, wait. Hey.　-What the heck? You're really good. I'm in the middle of class. Huh?　-Class. Oh gosh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were teaching. I'm Hyuk's brother. Hello.　-Hello. Oh, take this. Thank you. Have some. If I'd known, I'd have bought one more. Please teach him well. No need to worry. He's talented, works hard. I'll bet he makes it to the finals. If he wins, he's exempted from military service? That's why people work so hard for it. Please! You can do this! Look, I've got class till 3:00. Sorry, I'll go now. Go get'em!　-Will you be at school? Yeah.　-I'll call you. Okay. Work it! Yeah. See you. See you later! Alright. Just do it! Yeah, please go. You rock! Okay already. He's just... that's how he is.　-Sure. It was an established actor and an actor with a bit part. But the bit actor was so much better. His emotions. Don't push yourself too hard. You'll get sick. I'm fine. Yeah, give yourself a break. Do you smoke? Judy doesn't smoke, so I quit. Damn, what about me? Judy's mother doesn't smoke. Oh right. How about changing her character to one who smokes in secret? I'm just kidding. My brother asked me to quit. You have a brother?　-Yeah. He's a great dancer, and quite a looker. Oh, he choreographed my audition piece. That's why it was so fluid and natural. It was quite touching. Thanks. Oh, right. About that scene where I hit you. Yeah. Will you be okay? Yeah, no problem! People call me Iron Palm. I'm a bit violent. It's all right, smack me hard. Be true to your emotions. Shall we start for real tomorrow? Okay, then. Mom. After all I've done, you blame me? How was it?　-Really good. Isn't it?　-Yeah. Everyone's great, and we help each other. Thanks so much.　-Sure. So cold. Hey!　-June! This is who I told you about. You're Woo-jae? Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Seong Woo-jae.　-Hi. Heard so much about you. You've been saying bad things behind my back? Stop it! I didn't. I couldn't have made it into Dark Life without her. Bullshit. It's all because of his talent. He is good. Anyways, it's awesome to meet you. Likewise. What do you like? Let's eat something nice. Uh, anything? Anything? Let's go. Just a moment. Let's take a photo. Give me a break. 1, 2, 3. One more. 1, 2. You look great. 1, 2. Please, for my sake. Billy. I just want to love like other women do! Please, snap out of it! You were born as a man! Come in. Have a seat... Mom. Billy... What is this? Why the makeup and outfit? A cross-dressing party? Mom, this is the real me. （Sold out.）. The show is so good. He's handsome. This world is nothing but tragedy. Why was I even born? Now I just want to escape this pain. I didn't choose to be born this way. It's not my fault. To Kim Gi-nam. That was great. Thank you. Can I have one too? Make it out to Lee Sang-min. Thank you. Us too. It was really amazing.　-Thank you. Really. Hello.　-Hi. That was a great show. Thank you. My name is Ahn Jung-mi. Oh Song-jun. All shows up to the last one are sold out. Can you believe it? A little.　-A little? Just kidding. Well, it's not because of me. Director Kim Tae-baek, the cast and crew all worked hard to make this possible. All I want is to support them and give an honest performance. Honest acting.　-Yes. I think you really succeeded. Thank you. Tell me about the audition. Sure... There are still many people who criticize and hurt you. After Ina brought me to you, you've taught and helped me so much. So to repay you, I'm working hard to deliver as truthful an interpretation as I can of your pain. I hope this play can help create a society where more people understand each other. Thank you. It's my lovelies! Are you okay? I'm okay, thank you. And you? And you? Hey! How could you have kept that from me? I'm disappointed in you. - You were still the first. - You think it's easy? What's so complicated? Just say it! Look at him. Hey! Hey! Are you okay? Mr. Oh, are you home? Delivery! Coming. This is so much. You really shouldn't have. But are you coming to see your son's show? How about Sunday? I'll tell Hyuk to pick you up at the terminal. And stop sending so much. It must cost you a fortune. Phew. Song-jun? Yeah. Is something wrong? No. Got you 2 tickets for Sunday. Thanks. NamSo, I know it's sold out, but can I get one ticket for Wednesday? Nope. Break a leg! She's cute. Let's go! Are you really okay? I'm fine.　-Really? I just need sleep. Sleepless nights?　-Yeah. Really. Really? Okay. See you in a bit.　-Okay. Come in. Have a seat... Billy... What is this? Why the makeup and outfit? A cross-dressing party? Mom. This is the real me. What are you saying? Billy! I... A little? Slightly.　-Excuse me. That isn't easy. Sorry about that. What? My lines. Why? I liked it. Director, what do you think? I was in tears. I think... It's fitting. It should be hard for him to speak at that moment. It's Judy's first time telling her mom. She must've been filled with doubt. At first I thought you had some problem. But I think Song-jun's right. It fits that scene. Right. It felt real to me. It was like he was my real son. Good job, Song-jun! There was a different look in his eyes before the show. So this is what he was going for. You're turning into Judy. Right. You won't get possessed, will you? From now on, go with your instincts. I trust you. You're doing well. Yeah. Keep it up.　-Nice work. What are you doing here? You jerk. Huh? Is that any way to greet your brother? What the hell? I thought you quit smoking. Man, you're hopeless. How's the show? Huh? I called, but you didn't answer. Didn't call back. Right. Sorry, I've been busy practicing. Why'd you call? Sunday, Mom's coming to watch. You take care of her. I can't on Sunday. Make time, then. Make time. All right. I've got to practice. What? What is it? This isn't right. What isn't? Don't forget, Sunday. Fine. I'm off. Song-jun. There's this guy I'm acting with. You okay with older men? He's a former model, now he's acting. What the heck? He's a great guy. If you meet him... No thanks. Why not? What do you think? You're already seeing someone? No. Then why not? I'm just not looking to start dating yet... I see. I'm late for class. Okay, go. Song-jun! Time for the fog test! Was it hard to watch? No, I liked it. Good job. Did you really?　-Yeah. You?　-It was good. Someone could mistake you for a girl. That didn't disgust you? You're my son, how could it disgust me? What if I were like that for real? Don't you even joke about something like that. I'm kidding. Hyuk, take her to the restaurant. I'll join you soon. OK! You saw that? Mom's looking quite old. You're right, she is. So we shouldn't give her any cause to be upset. We don't. At least I don't. You're the problem. Quit it. What is it? Don't ever do that again. Do what? Do that one more time, and I'll kill you. Bro! What's wrong with you? That was amazing. Thank you. It was a great show.　-Thank you. Please leave a message after the beep. Stop it. You fucker! Touch me again and I'll kill you. Great work, everyone! Please leave a message after the beep. Are you okay? Director! Why'd you drink so much? I'm just so happy. Thanks for doing so well. Not at all. You see, everybody says this Dark Life's the best ever. It had to be, right? The only path to success is being truthful. Because the world has gone crazy. In my time this word "truthful" didn't exist. It's a word made by this era. In the old days... Hi, Song-jun! Hey honey. Hello. Good to see you. I'll catch you later.　-Okay. Come inside, it's cold. Wait a sec. You happy? Song-jun? Bro! Don't! Don't do it! Stop! Die! I warned you. Don't! Please stop it! Stop! Just stop! I said I'd kill you if you do this shit again! Are my words garbage? What did I do wrong? What? Please stop. Please... Hyuk. Calm down. Be still a moment. My recital. Woo-jae. What about my recital? It hurts. Woo-jae. What will I do... Must be this cold weather. My back aches. My legs... I'm stiff all over. What're you doing? Hurry up. Guess he's late today. Come in. Have a seat. What's with your outfit? Hyuk. Go away. Hyuk, let's talk. Go away. Just go! Keep quiet there, will you? There's something I want to tell you all. I've decided to step out from the long tunnel I've been trapped in. I've picked a date in June. Congratulations! Actually I haven't even told my parents yet. I decided this on my own. But as time goes by... Hi Ina. So I made up my mind. Some of you are out already, and others will be later... Sorry I'm late. Thanks to you, I've gathered up the courage to tell them. I wanted to let you guys know first. Good luck! Let's start. Sharp blades silently pierce my heart. That look of fear on your face is the real you. I cry again, abandoned and ruined. Why must I? Because of you. Your fake expression, the digusting look in your eyes. It gives me the chills, and cuts me deep. I don't blame you. I just want you to die. Ina, is something wrong? I liked your song today. Really? Yeah, it was great. What was? Huh? What did you like about it? What? You like the lyrics? I told you. Fuckers like you make me sick. Ina. I didn't... Hello. Ina. Ina! Hello. How are you doing? Huh? Your brother was discharged this morning. Really? It's cold, take a coat. The phone you're calling has been turned off... Hey! Are you okay? Are you okay? Yes. （Due to personal reasons, ） （Sung Woo-jae's class is closed.）. Hello! Hello. Hi. Is Hyuk okay? I heard he was in an accident. He's not answering his phone. Is he badly hurt? Yes. It's such a shame this happened now. Which hospital is he at? Are you okay? What? I'm fine. We're about to start. I know. I'll give you the cue. Fuck off. Don't tell me what to do. Okay. Go get 'em. Thank you.　-Thank you. Wow. Yeah. Did you watch it? Of course! Came to see my friend. But I almost had to leave in the middle. Why? Transgender... yuck! Just kidding. You were so fucking good. I was sick with jealousy. I still am. I'm dying here. Shut up. You've got it made. I'm so jealous. Let's go for a drink. I have shooting tomorrow in the countryside. A commercial film?　-Yeah. Congrats. It's a bit role. Compared to you... damn. But man, you did really good. Real acting, I guess, needs understanding. Awesome. It felt truthful. So proud of you. Let's go. Goddamn it... I just can't do this. It's fucking killing me. How much longer? Finally, it's the last show! Thank you all for pulling it off without any accidents. And my Judy.　-Yes. It's the last time, so I hope you release Judy's pain. Yes. Dark Life. Let's go! Let's do it! Go get 'em. Break a leg! Song-jun, someone's here for you. Who? I don't know. I'm all made up. But I think you need to see this person. Sorry. I drank too much last night. What else is new? But last night was a special occasion. Wait till the wrap party tonight. Are you joking? What? Never mind. Where are you going? Have a smoke. That's okay. I know you still smoke. I understand. I don't have a light. I've seen actors pick up smoking, but never seen one quit for a play. What's with this weather? Let's head in. See you inside.　-Okay. Why not? Can't I smoke? You can but I can't? I'm going to the army. Thanks to you. You'll never know how painful it is for a person like me to go there. Not that you care. I'll fucking kill myself in the army. Don't say that. It's hard for me too. I did it for your own good. For my own good? I didn't come here to hear such crap. You're my only brother. So I came to say goodbye. Bro... Whatever I do in the future, you just stay away. Come on. Don't say that. You call yourself an actor? You knew what that recital meant to me. It's the same as killing me. Yeah, I'm already dead. So... stop being a fake. Hyuk. Okay? Don't be a hypocrite. Bye. Chang-guk, I'm so sorry! I've been such a prick to you. I'm sorry. It's no problem. - No, no. I'm sorry for fooling around. - Don't mind. No please, I'm really sorry. It's okay.　-I apologize. It's okay.　-Really? Thanks, man. NamSo!　-What the hell? The best AD ever?　-Yes. You've been great. - Sorry I've been such an ass. - No. It's okay. I'm usually not like that.　-It's okay. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Sure, why wouldn't I be? Chang-guk, I'll wait for you backstage. Are we good? Yeah. Go for it. I'm sorry. Is he fucking crazy? He looks mentally ill. I'm worried. (DARK LIFE The final performance//Sold Out) Your body is so cold. You used to be so warm. Now you're freezing cold. You gave me a reason to live. But I ended your life. Just as all of you saw... This man, for my sake... Fuck. Fuck, what have I done wrong? What the hell have I done wrong! What did I do wrong? Why are you doing this! You can't do this to me! Not in my sight! What the fuck did I do wrong? What did I do? Why won't you leave me alone? I want to fucking end this. What do you want from me? What the hell should I do? What should I do now? Shit. Fuck it. It's me who needs to die. Watch! Watch! Watch! It's all over now. LOST TO SHAME
