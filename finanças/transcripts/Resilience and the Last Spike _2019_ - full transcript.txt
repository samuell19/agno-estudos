From the first time I heard it I was obsessed. It's Utah's most amazing legend and captivating mystery. Telling the story of lost gems, a friendship among peoples from different lands. a beautiful woman and a courageous man never to be heard from again When I get fascinated with something watch out. Maybe that's why my parents named me Resilience. An old legend tells of precious red barryl gems that were discovered while digging the tunnels for the railroad these gems are so rare that Utah's one of only two places on Earth that they can be found it was 1869 and Utah not yet a state for the site for the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroad's to meet this made railroad travel across the entire country possible for the first time in the US history. The Chinese had a large part in making this happen. the old story says that the man that found them was a member of my family that remains a mystery but it would explain where I get my hunger for adventure It's in my blood . is it possible that somewhere in the desolate Hills lie treasure. Lost gems that have been hidden for centuries. I couldn't be sure but I was determined to find out. ladies and gentlemen hence forth there is one Pacific Railroad of the United States of America Here! Here! [Applause] Can you trust him? I trust him because he is different. How do you know this? The last railroad boss you trusted killed your two friends! Yes, it is true. But this man, Samuel Hawkins is different. He is a very good man. I see it when he is with his family. I trust him. I miss my family so much! I also miss my family, but don'’t worry, Lian. When we get to San Francisco, your family will have enough to buy your freedom. Thank you, Tao. You take care of us so much. Tao ... You need to leave first light. The horses and wagon will be waiting for you. The gems you found must be very valuable. I saw the horses and wagon. They are so great. Thank you, Lian. When we arrive in San Francisco, we'’ll send somebody to you. Thank you so much, Kai. It'’s my honor. Take care,Tao. Goodbye, Lian. Storm clouds are coming! Look out! Jump! Resilience are you there? Are you there? Resilience! Please respond There is no one here by that name Oh so you are alive. Rizzy is in trouble? You realize what time it is? It's time for you guys leave me alone. What was that I didn't read you? I said I'm coming, see you back at camp Last one there does the dishes I don't think so. Really! you had time to change your clothes and braid your hair. Who are you? Yeah, here got something for you. Funny, very funny. You cheated. You were slow. We have three people, we were heavy. Two and a quarter. Kids calm down, we both know Rizzy cheated fair and square How'd she run? Smooth I could barely hear it, It's amazing. Then you should have had no trouble hearing our calls right? Your mom's right Rizz. We had a deal, you were gonna remain in eyesight. You should have kept up. Rizzy I'am serious you cannot go riding off into the desert on your own something could have happened. Like something awesome? Everything is awesome, part of a team. What? Nothing. Rizzy was just looking for that stupid treasure. Shut up Wes. You shut up. Kids behave. Rizzy we had an agreement. But I'm close, I can feel it Rizzy there's lots of dangerous things out there. Any one of them could kill you Then what have you been training me for? Everything we've been teaching you is just in case. You don't purposely put yourself in that situation Rizz. Rizzy it's not that we don't trust you we just want you to be safe. Yeah I guess you're right. Tell you what, you pretend you like us as a family just for one night and help me make this fire we'll go anywhere you want tomorrow. I guess I guess that's okay. We love you baby. How amazing is it that they took the railroad from coast-to-coast. Not so amazing when you use slave labor That's unfortunate that so many of the rail bosses took advantage of the Chinese Not all of them did. Your great-great uncle Samuel Hawkins, He actually went out of his way to help the Chinese. He felt bad for them and he tried to make things right. Even so, thats what makes this treasure so important, To see if it's even true. What legend? 150 years ago, A small group of Chinese headed out through the desert. Tao! Tao hold on! He's come to kill us! Tao hold on! Hey Tao! Its the man from the camp Oh Samuel Hawkins! Woah! Woah! Tao. I chased you half way across the country. You didn't recognize me? He's our friend, our friend. Yeah I'm your friend What time did you leave Tao? Lian said you'd be leaving at first light She, she's a nice lady. Follow me there's a good place to set camp up around the corner. Looks clear. Hey my friend. Long as you stay along this path should be fine But what if we see others? Well they're just regular folk you just pay them no mind. Just about everyone's headed to California. But what if we see them? Then you head south like your hair's on fire Straight to Navajo territory. You're better off with them injuns, than running a foul with Union Pacific men. You mean, men like you? No Tao. I didn't sign up no slave driver. You know what Jeb did, holding your wages killing your kin when they try to tell on him I just wished I could have stopped him sooner Thank you. Listen don't thank me yet it's a long way to San Francisco. What you got in them cases though should set your family up for life. I hope it is true. Got something better for you Thank you. I'm so sorry you need to go through that you tell us. You're a good man Tao. Like the way I see it between the heat and the freezing cold and snakes, spiders and malaria, hanging off the side of a cliff with nothing but a pocket full of dynamite to keep you company You fellas deserve it and more. Thank you. As far as that go Tao. I better go before I'm missed. I hope I can see you again Samuel Hawkins. This life or the next my friend. We camp here tonight. That's enough. Time for bed.

You can't leave me here! You can't leave me here! I don't like wolves. Hey watch it. Are you the police? Yeah. What? What? What's the matter?

Oh honey. Okay just hold on hold on. Are you talking about that... You need me to call someone Pete? No, just hold on. You talking about that big storm about three days ago? Yes What have you been doing since? I had to go to juniper landing. You rode your motorcycle from echo point to juniper landing all by yourself No I walked. I would have got there sooner, but there were these two bad guys and they captured me and held me in their shack. Wait wait wait. Were you kidnapped? Yeah. Did they hurt you? No they fought each other mostly. Would you recognize them agin? Well of course I would I mean. Colton. Yeah. There's some sketches behind the register of some vagrances we're looking for. Alright.

We're going to get some people together. and we're going to go look for your family. but it'd help us a lot if you could tell if you us where these bad guys held you. Well yeah i mean we would have to pick up Scorn on the way. I tied him to a tree after I knocked him off his motorcycle that is assuming the wolf hasn't gotten him yet. I only had a little bit of jerky to share with him. He's probably hungry. You fed a wolf? Well he was chasing me and i figured he was just hungry. So yeah. Ghost was unconscious back at their little shack when I left them. He received a shovel to the head. I'm not quite sure if he's awake now or not. Right. So what are we waiting for? Earl do you copy?
