That's just a cheap trick to speed up production. I'm through! "Benjamin Goodman" I am a musician. An artist! I brought Beethoven to Briarwood and spring cleaning is beneath my dignity. It's degrading- Yes, yes, I know all that. But now here. You take this rug, and take it out in the yard and beat the stuffing out of it. No sir! I draw the line on beating poor, defenseless carpets. I'm too kind-hearted for that. Besides, what if the neighbors should see me? Oooh, there would be a terrible scandal. But at least the house'd be clean. Don't forget! Felix is coming in from Baltimore this evening. The least we can do is to give him a good house to step into. You'll hear from the Musicians Union about this! Good day, Mr. Lemp. I do hope your daughter gets good news from the doctor. Wait a minute! What daughter, what doctor? Your daughter Emma has an appointment at - let me see - At 4 o'clock this afternoon with Doctor Forrest. What about? Naturally, I wouldn't know that for a while yet. Oh, well I have every confidence, Mrs. Ridgefield, that you'll know long before the doctor does. Is there anything more you think I ought to know about my family? No. No, it's been a dull week, hasn't it. Goodbye, Mrs. Ridgefield! Hi, dad. - Hello, dad. I want you two girls to divorce your husbands immediately and come home and live. I cannot do this spring cleaning all by myself. How's my wonderful dad? Your wonderful dad has Housemaid's Knee. You look alright to me. Girls, girls, hurry up! There's something we must settle right away! What? What is it? Say, Emma, Emma... Etta! Ah, Etta, here are your two married nieces. Hello, Aunt Etta. - Hello. I'm very glad to see you. You're just in time. Spring house-cleaning. This gets on my nerves. You take the dustpan and you take the mop. There's something important. Aunt Etta, come here all of you. We've got a decision to make! Well? What is it now? I found this in Ann's room. It's Mickey's picture. Isn't it natural? Her husband's picture? And the poor boy died only such a short time ago. Yes, I know. But you see, Felix gets back from Baltimore today. After all, it's only a matter of time before Ann marries him. I thought it'd be a good idea to slip the picture out of the room... you know, to, sort of, ease her out of the past. No, no, I don't think that'd be right. I agree with Kay. I think Ann's forgotten about Mickey by now. After all, Ann never really loved Mickey. She just felt sorry for him. Yes, Felix was the one, He was always the one. Still... Ann might not even notice the picture's gone. I never could have been fond of that boy. It might not be a bad idea to let Ann and Felix start off with a clean slate. Play down any link with the past. Maybe you're right. Put the picture in the attic and let's see what happens. That's a sensible thing to do. Let's give it a try. Oh, Emma, if you happen to be passing the attic... the phone, I'm expecting a call. I'll take it up to the attic. Oh, no you don't, that's just a feeble excuse ...for you to listen in on the telephone upstairs. Well I'm tired of getting things second-hand from Mrs. Ridgefield. You haven't finished cleaning the dining room carpet yet Go to work on that! Nice way to usher in the spring. Just a minute, darling. It's Ernest. Hurry up Kay, and get dressed. We'll be late for our appointment. Will you help me? - Yes I will. Hello? What's that? Well honey, there's so much noise there- I can't underst- Everybody sounds so excited. Are you alright? What? "Have I been to the doctors yet?" You know my appointment is at four, it's only... ...three thirty now! I know, but that watch I gave you, it might be wrong. After all, I won it at a raffle. Aww, Ernest, it's a wonderful watch. It keeps time beautifully. I don't know, maybe at a time like this it oughta be fast? That's sweet of you, Ernest. I sent you some flowers, to the doctor's office. There was such a nice arrangement in the window... And you know me I- Adam, what on earth are you up to, I declare, you're a worse busybody than I am! It's my daughter and my telephone, and I've got a right to hear what's said on it! won't hear anything of the kind! Sorry Ernest, it's so noisy. What did you say? Emma, are you sure he's a good doctor? Certainly he is. Ernest, don't you worry. I'll have to call you back. Don't rush me Thea, we have plenty of time. Oh you're so lazy. Come on, Emma. I'll get my hat and coat and go with you. Not on your life. Half the windows upstairs aren't washed yet. Nobody ever goes upstairs. Come on, girls, let's go. You're not going to leave me to do all this work. Never mind dad, you'll read all about it in the "Medical Journal". Goodbye. - But... Emma... Goodbye darling. Bye Aunt Etta. Yoo-hoo! Hello, girls! Hello, Ben. - Hello, dear. You certainly lead a hard life, Ben Crowley. Getting through at three thirty in the afternoon. I told my secretary my grandmother was sick. We'll see you later, we're having dinner here. Where're you going? - Dr. Forrest's. Oh, yes, Dr. Forrest... Hey, wait a minute! Dr. Forrest. Dr. Forrest, the obstetrician? Yup! That means that Thea... Thea... Thea... Where is Etta? I gotta kiss someone! I don't know what you're getting excited about, but in the meantime, take this! Thank you. What's it for? You'll find out. Gimme a kiss, Aunt Etta. - Don't be a fool. I'm finished, Mrs. Borden You play that piece much too fast, but I'm not complaining. Listen, Matilda, are you sure your mother wants you to be a concert violinist? My mother says that in two years, I've got to give my first concert at Town Hall. But you have to be very, very good to play at Town Hall. You know they don't take everybody. They'll take me. My daddy owns the Town Hall. Alright, Matilda. Maybe if I give you the tempo on the piano it'll help you. We'll take that place once through again, but just once Alright. One, two... Now, slower. Say, that's a little bit better-! It's a whole lot better! Felix! How are ya, Lemp! Pretty good, Dietz. It's alright, don't mind Matilda, she's here on the scholarship. Come here and tell me how the music lovers treated you in Baltimore. After I played Beethoven, They wanted Brahms. When I played Brahms, the season was over. We've read all your notices. Gee they were wonderful! Dad's green with envy. That's a color that becomes him. On the way home, I stopped over in New York, for the Fair. Oh really? Is it everything San Francisco says it is? Yeah. Wonderful exhibits! Here's something I picked up at the... glass exhibit. Why Felix! A real diamond! It is? Then they put something over on me. They assured me it was glass. Ah, it's beautiful. You didn't put anything on paper... you didn't post a bond... ...so I had to do something to make it binding. Now, in the eyes of the Jeweller's Association, we're man and wife. Congratulations. You just concentrate on your music, Matilda. Ann, if Matilda weren't here, I would tell you how much I love you. I'd tell you, how, every minute in Baltimore- But I am here. And I ain't gettin' a bit of attention, either. It's gee, it's 3:45, and I've got to meet Emma at the doctor's at four. She has an appointment. But if it's Emma's appointment, why do you have to go? Listen, when one Lemp girl goes to the doctor, we all go. You're excused, Matilda. Can I go with you? I'm sorry, darling, this is strictly a women's conference. Ann. Now that Matilda isn't here... Gee I'm glad you're back. I ran all the way from the station. The taxi wasn't fast enough. You're not to leave Briarwood again. If Baltimore wants to hear you conduct, let Baltimore come to Briarwood. I think it can be arranged. And Felix... - Yes? Matilda still isn't here. I'm supposed to have an hour lesson every day, ...and I've still got a half hour to go. Matilda's right. 'Course I'm right! Felix, do you mind? - Aw, now, that isn't fair! You'll find some cotton in the lower left hand drawer. Put it in your ears! So long darling, I'll see you later. Come in, Mrs. Talbot. Thank you, Doctor. Now let's don't get nervous. He's the first baby in the family. But it isn't the first baby in the world. I know... Your appointment is tomorrow morning at eleven. Thank you very much. Oh, excuse me. Dr. Forrest's office. Tomorr- Oh, yes, Mr. Collins. Tomorrow afternoon? Ehm... two thirty? Alright. Thank you Doctor. Just watch your diet and you'll be alright. Good day. Is Doc Clint in? Are you sure you want to see him here? Doctor Forrest is at the clinic twice a week. Hello, Karl. - Oh, hello, Doc. Say, this is some swell layout you got here. Yeah well, we've got to put on some sort of a show for the carriage trade. Have that made up and sent to Ms. Clement, please. Yes, Doctor. Step into my office, I'll pretend to know something about medicine. Oh uh, you don't mind if I see him first, do you? We aren't patients. We're waiting for our sister. She's in with your father. We have "Esquire" for the women, "Vogue" for men. Help yourself. How's the gout? Oooh, not so good, Doc. Ahhh, you've been at that smorgasbord again! Remember: I saw him first. What are they doing, opening up a market here? Mr. Talbot sent these to your sister, Mrs. Crowley. Yes, we know, thank you. - You're welcome. "These flowers are not from Ernest the florist, but from Ernest the father." I bet he tried awful hard to think up something funny. Emma, ??what's wrong? I'm not going to have a baby, Thea ...not now, or ever. These flowers - they're for you, Emma. Thank you, Kay. - Emma, darling... I better go to Ernest. - Let me go with you. No, Kay, I'll go alone I'll- I'll walk; the air'll do me good! Isn't nature wonderful? She's perfectly healthy. First-rate condition otherwise. But it's just one of those things. I really think I should've gone with her. I'll try and catch her. Do not worry about your sister, She'll be alright. It isn't Emma I'm worried about, It's Ernest! Thank you, Doctor, but I... Just a moment, Miss Lemp, I'd like to speak with you about your sister. By the way Doc, when you gonna send me a bill? Oh, I keep forgetting. Two years is a long time to forget, ain't it Doc? Yeah, but don't you forget to come back on Wednesday. In a few days, she'll be entirely over it. Ann! Do not be alarmed. Too fast a ride on the elevator, I guess. No, take her to my office, Clinton. Just a minute. Well? Dad and Miss Lovett are taking care of her, she'll be alright. Friend of yours? My kid sister. What happened? She stumbled out of the elevator and fell into my arms! I didn't know I had that kind of an effect on women. Here. Finish the article, I'll be back in a minute. Oh my darling! Thea! What on earth! Easy does it darling, easy does it! Where do you think you're taking me? I'll take you to the finest specialist in New York. No country doctor's gonna bring my baby into the world. What on earth are you talking about? I'll take care of everything. I'll get a nurse first thing in the morning. Have you gone out of your head? I'm not going to have a baby. It's Emma, ??although she's not going to have a baby, either. Slide over. Drive us back to the house, will you? She's absolutely alright now. By the way, where can I get in touch with her husband? Her husband? He died a short time ago. Oh, did he? That's too bad... What is it, doctor? Just this: she's going to have his child. This is it. Thanks a lot for driving me home. No, thanks for getting me out of the office. Do you feel better? I won't have to be carried into the house. Gee, I hate the ordeal of breaking the news to the family. You don't have to, Mrs. Ridgefield has already done the job. People say she must be a crystal-gazer. I think I'll run up to my room the back way. Lie down awhile. Thanks again. She doesn't look very happy. I suppose it's only natural; husband gone... It's much more complicated than that. I think her doctor ought to know all the facts. You see, Ann is engaged to marry Felix. About a year ago, when Felix came to live with us, all four of us girls thought we were in love with him. Felix chose Ann. Emma was the hardest hit of us all. It wasn't until Ann's wedding day that she realized how Emma felt. So she ran off with Mickey Borden, who was mad about her. How'd it come out? Mickey tried to make a living. No-go. Ann tried to forget Felix and love Mickey... No-go. She couldn't fool Mickey. He realized what he was doing to her life. One night, he drove Ben's car off the road. You can never convince me it was an accident. Yes, I remember reading something about it in the newspaper. I'll give my father all the facts. Why? Aren't you going to be looking after her? No, I wouldn't be able to. I'm giving up my practice. Giving up your practice? That's terrible. Why? Oh, I find I make too good a living at it. Too good a... I'm sorry, do you mind repeating that? You see, my practice is beginning to cut into- No, I better should start at the beginning. See, I became a doctor simply because my father was a doctor. You know. Family tradition Then it occurred to me that's a silly reason So I had a heart-to-heart talk with myself and I discovered I had ideals. Maybe I've been reading too much Pasteur and Ehrlich. ...but I began to look at humanity pretty much from their point of view. Anyway, now I see myself knee-deep in the problem of why the lumber-men in the factory on the south side have so much trouble with their lungs. The pneumoconiosis? I'm trying to find out why they get pneumoconiosis ...and why the boys who sit behind the desk simply get calluses. But you know... ...the more money I make, the less I feel about finding out. So I'm putting a stop to the money-making. Monday morning I start work as factory doctor. 40 dollars a week. And you're giving up your practice for-? Doctor, are you sure you're feeling alright? I don't know, but if I had your ideas, I'd see a good doctor. No, really, I think it's swell. Well, it's been a nice afternoon. I enjoyed it. So long. Oooh, careful! The grass is wet! Doctor Forrest. Does your job at the factory allow you to treat any outside patients? If it's a very special case. Or a very special person? I make my own rules, I can break one of them. I see. Well, goodbye and... ...here's hoping you lick pneumo... pneumonia... Pneumoconiosis I'll lick it. I can pronounce it. That's half the battle. So long! So long! Bye. - Bye! Can somebody please tell me why we're all so gloomy? I'm going to be a grandfather, Ben's gonna be an uncle. All you girls are gonna be aunts. One girl gets one baby, we all get new titles. I think it's wonderful, besides, I'm hungry. Wonderful indeed. With Ann all set to marry Felix, and now she's going to have Mickey's baby. How do you ever suppose we're going to tell Felix about that. And Emma never going to have a baby. And you sit there, all ready to enjoy your soup. I said I was going to eat my soup. I didn't say I was going to enjoy it. You're not catching cold, are you? Gee I hope so. Hello, Felix. Felix, old boy. Glad to see you. Now don't make a fuss over me. I know I've been away along time, and you're all overjoyed to see me. ...but no demonstration please. Let me slip quietly into my old seat and let things go on as before. Glad you're back, Felix. - Thank you, Adam. You're looking very well, Felix. - Thank you. How was Baltimore? Fine. Say, what's the idea of taking me seriously? Well, I want you people to know I'm glad to see you. Say, how far does a fella have to go ...how long does he have to be away before he can get a decent "Hello" out of this crowd? Hello. That's some progress. There is something very wrong in this house. No, Felix, everything's fine... Now I'm convinced there's something wrong. Where's Ann. Somebody answer me! Is anything wrong with Ann? Why of course not. She's up in her room, writing letters. She had a late lunch. - She's taking a nap. I see. She's writing letters and taking a nap at the same time. She's a light sleeper. Besides, they weren't letters, they were postcards. Adam, you're head of this family. Well, that's enough to eat, for me... I'm gonna go walk it off in the garden. I'm up to the neck, too. I'll join you, Adam. Yes sir. There's nothing like a little exercise. No, no, you're not running out on me. You're going to tell me what's wrong. Etta's older than I am, she'll um, uh... Mickey's picture, where is it? It was in my room. I was just cleaning your room and- I may have, along with some other things- You hid it. You see, dear, we thought that Kay... uh- Yes, we all thought- What right did you have to hide it? Why didn't you ask me? I want his picture back. You've no right to meddle! Kay! I'm sorry. Well, Felix, you might as well know- Hello Ann. Your father says we may be in the middle of April, but this breeze is a leftover from March. Thanks. Your father also says he's going to make the best-looking grandfather in Briarwood. Yeah. I know. Your father started to tell me and Etta finished. You're free, Felix, I won't saddle y- Don't even bother to finish that sentence, because it's a lot of nonsense. It doesn't make a bit of difference. At my age, I couldn't stop loving you. And anyway, I couldn't possibly get a refund on the ring. You have a very noble character. Did you know that? Yes, I know it. But I didn't think it showed. Our gate's like a new person. We had the hinges lifted and changed to summer oil. Fine. It practically sings as it swings. Everything's alright, folks. They're swinging on the gate. Thank heavens! Now we can eat. Felix and I just know each other. I'm orchestrating his composition. Is that part of Felix's composition? Something of my own. It's beautiful. It's only got a middle. No beginning? No end? Just a middle. Is it right to leave a song dangling in mid-air? No face, no feet? Do you think they'd let me win? Who? They. The Fates. The Destinies. They been at me now for 28 years. No let-up. First they said, let him do without parents. Then they decided, "He don't need no education, that's for sissies." Then, right at the beginning, they tossed a coin. Heads he's poor; tails he's rich. They tossed a coin. Had two heads. For the finale, they got together on talent. "Sure", they said, "let him have talent." "Not enough to let him do something on his own, anything good, or great..." "just enough to let him help other people." "It's all he deserves." When you put all this together, and you got Michael Borden. Hello, Aunt Etta. - Hello, my dear. How's Ernest? - Well... yes and no... He's selling a lot of flowers, but the give him hay fever. Isn't that Mickey's song? Yes. She's been at it all day, poor child. Just pecking at it, and pecking at it. Gosh, I thought by this time- Oh, my dear, she gets worse and worse. When she's not playing his tune, she's talking about him. She never used to mention him. No... But since she found out she's going to have Mickey's baby she can't seem to get him out of her mind. And you know what that means. If she doesn't get him out of her mind, she'll never marry Felix. Poor boy... It's up to us to snap her out of it. Haven't I been doing nothing else? Only yesterday I had your father trying to stand on his head! Can't we do something drastic, like... burning the piano? We cannot, not until it's paid for! Hello, Ann. Thank you, I will sit down. Remember our first duet we played at the Foundation? Gosh, how many years ago was that? It wasn't important, anyway. We were sensations, though. Why not? It was a sensational tune. May I have the check, please? - Why, doctor. Oh, hello! Miss uh... how've you been? You forgot. No, no such thing. I remember perfectly... Miss uh... Lamp. Lamp? That's not my idea of perfection. I've got it: Limp! Limp? Lemp's the name. - Lemp! Joan Lemp! I couldn't forget 'Joan', it's such a lovely name. Mm, it is, much lovelier than my own name, which happens to be Kay. Kay? - Yeah. Oh, now it comes back. I remember everything. Sit down, Kay. You shouldn't be walking around on such a hot day. Especially since uh... Listen, I have a sister, Her name isn't Joan, either. She shouldn't be walking around on such a hot day, "especially since", not I. My name is Clinton Forrest, In case you'd forgotten it. No, I hadn't, but I suppose I should have. I am sorry. I'll buy your lunch. Darn right you will. And I want some free medical advice. Hmm? - It's about my sister, Ann. But before you get to her, consider me a patient. What's wrong? - Feel that. Feel that steady thumping? Thump, thump, thump... thump, thump I do. - What do you think it is? It's your pulse, and if it didn't thump, you'd be dead. Oh really? How interesting. Any other strange thumping about the premises? There should be something wrong with me. What diseases are prevalent this spring? Nothing you'd be liable to catch. I'm sorry to tell you this, Joan, but you're the healthiest-lookin' girl I've ever seen. I am? Well, I'm still young. I'll contract something. Meantime, I'll have a healthy lunch. Now then, what's the trouble with your sister? She seems to be getting worse. I told you Ann never really loved Mickey. But since she found out she's going to have his baby, he's become an obsession with her. He's all she thinks about, how unlucky he was, ...how great he might have been. She's moody and melancholy. She's got the family crazy. We're worried sick about her. There's a long medical term for her state of mind. Do you think she can be helped? It would be a simple matter for any good psychiatrist. Well, is that in your field? Every doctor has to practice a certain amount of it. Fine, I'll bring her around to your office. No. That'd be the worst thing you could do. We can't let her know she's a patient. Well, better still, I'll invite you to the house for dinner. You can see her there. - It's a good start. Then, after dinner, we can go to a movie or a dance, ...have a soda and a sandwich afterwards, ...a moonlight drive in the parkway... Wait a moment, that's a pretty full evening right there! When will I get a chance to talk to Ann? It wouldn't be so terrible if you didn't get to it the first evening. After a week's steady dating with me, you'll be considered one of the family. Then it'd be a cinch. Maybe I'd get a chance to talk to her between courses. Shall we say... Tomorrow night for dinner? Tonight would be better. Tomorrow night you'll only get the leftovers from tonight's turkey. Alright, tonight, then. Let me have that flower. You go ahead and answer the door, I don't trust these two sirens. Oh, I'm so excited, I know it'll be good for her. Poor Ann. I hope so. Ah, there goes the last. Hello, Ann. - Hello, Ernest. Hello everybody. It's Ben again on time. Turkey, huh? At this time of year, that means "hello." Sorry I'm late. For you, Aunt Etta. Oh, they're beautiful. You never forget, do you. Thank you so much. That means, "you're welcome". Will you put them in water, dear? Now what are you doing for that cold- I suppose I'll have to wait for Father's Day before someone brings me flowers. Say, when is the Father's Day? Last Sunday. Last Sunday? Why Dad! - Here's a flower. Why don't we all chip in and buy Dad a cigar? There are only eight of you, couldn't you make it two cigars? Aw, cheer up Dad, they're not good for you, anyway. Listen, seat me next to the doctor, I've got a very interesting pain I'd like to discuss with him. Oh no, no angling any free advice out of him. I don't want any advice, I only want someone to discuss it with. Here's your pipe. There he is now! No, not yet, not 'til I get set. Why not? Come on, girls, ??help me. Emma, throw me a magazine. Thea, take that stool, put it right down here. What's the big idea? Yes, Your Majesty, here you are. No, not that one. The "Literary Review"! I want him to think I'm intellectual. The encyclopedia'd be better. Aunt Etta, you bring the roses and put them over here. On the table. Of all the crazy families. How's the light? Any interesting shadows? You look ravishing. - Give me your hanky! You can answer it now. - Thank you, thank you. What's it all about, Adam? A young man is calling. Good evening. Does a Miss Joan Lump live here? Joan Lump? No, there's no Joan Lump living here. You must have the wrong address. Oh I'm sorry about that. - Not at all. You can relax. It wasn't your heartbeat. Aww... and I was all set. - Who was it? Just a nice looking young fellow who had the wrong house. He was looking for a Joan Lump. Hey, that's me! Which way did he go? - The only way he could go, out! The magazine! Hadn't you better take the lamp? Who is it? - It's I, Joan. I mean, Kay. What are you doing over here? I'm looking for you, but... ... I do not mind telling you these dogs around here are giving me an awful argument. They won't if you go over here where you belong. Through here. Come, the family's starved. Yes, so's that dog. Ah, the "Literary Review"! Mind if I see it? - Why, certainly. One must keep up with the world of ideas. April 1934... Did I say "keep up"? I meant "catch up". Well, here we are. - Yes, here we are. This is quite a large family, you'll have to meet them alphabetically. The whole family? This is my father, Mr. Lump- uh... Lemp. How are you, sir? - Glad to know you, Doc. By the way, I get a pain in my side- Oh father, please. This is Mr. Dietz, a friend of the family. How are you? - Hello, Doc, nice to know you. And this is my brother-in-law, Ben Crowley. My sister, Thea. Always good to meet somebody whose credit is good at the bank. And of course, Emma you know. And her husband, Ernest Talbot That means, "How do you do?" That means hay fever. Stay away from flowers. And of course, Ann, you remember her. Hello Ann. - Hello Doctor. Good to see you again. Well, I guess that's about all. Oh yes, I do want you to meet my Aunt Et- Yes dear? Oh, we've met before. Excuse me, I was just reading this cookbook, ...it's so intellectual. Aunt Etta is the siren of the family. I'll get even with you tomorrow. Attention everyone! The guest of honor is the famous Doctor... I'm sorry, it's slipped my mind... don't tell me. Just call me Doc. This is Dr. Clinton "pneumoconiosis" Forrest. My middle name is almost as bad, doctor. Doc, try a little homemade blackberry brandy. My favorite brandy. I made it myself. To your very good health, sir. I haven't had a glass of that blackberry brandy since the first night I called here. Well, Doc, sit down. Make yourself at home. Sit down, everybody. Make yourselves at home. Everybody's in it. That's Kay, in a shell, when she was a baby. Now, excuse me, I have to go and tend to the dinner. You don't want to look at that. Dr. Forrest. Kay cooked the whole dinner, every inch of it, herself. ...and look at her, she looks just as fresh and beautiful ...as if she just came out of a band box. Seems to me I've heard that before. It's a... little secret. Well, Doc, as I was saying, I get a pain in my side ...every time I think of what modern orchestras do to Beethoven. Do you care for Beethoven, Doc? Well, I might. What has he done? What has he done?! He composed some of the world's finest music. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't get around much to nightclubs. I'm gonna like him. Come along everybody, dinner's ready. Make sure his soup is cold! "Nightclubs"! Wasn't it the Chinese that used to drown their girl babies? I think so. Whatever happened to that beautiful custom? Turkey for dinner. Even the neck What did Beethoven do? That was lovely. Emma, ??you should practice more. If you keep your eye on the music sheets, instead of on that doctor, the vocal part might be much better. I'll get your coat. Stop it- Etta! Felix, I think it's a matter for the police. I think you've got something there. The very idea, just... sitting home. Sitting home! Don't you know you're supposed to walk an hour every day? Didn't my father give you a list of mimeographed instructions? He did it, but my father wrote some music on them... ...and sent it to a publisher in New York. Say... ...those instructions in the wrong hands Might lead to some interesting results. Just the same, You're going to walk an hour every day, even if I have to come over and walk it with you? Yessir. And don't you know you're supposed to be wear low-heeled shoes? I did not know, but I suppose now the music publisher does. But surely you didn't come out just to lecture me on the size of my heels. What makes you think I'd do a thing like that? The family's probably told you all about me. Yes, I admit it. You're the case history No. 307 in my files. Come on, let's sit down. We haven't walked an hour yet, and I'm not tired. Yes, but I am - and I'm still the doctor. Or do I have to wear spectacles to prove it? Well, Doc, ...what's wrong with me? Suppose you tell me what you think is wrong with you. I don't know. You're seeing things a lot differently now than you used to, aren't you? Yes, very different. I used to think so clearly. Now everything's so mixed up and muddled. Why must you question me. Why can't the family stop meddling? No, no, no, it's very much their business. You're being quite as unfair to them as you are to yourself. They're just as miserable about it as you are. What we do must affect other people. Besides, you can't go through life entirely wrapped in cellophane. You had plans before this came up. You were going to marry, weren't you? Yes. This fellow, Dietz, do you love him? I suppose I haven't acted like it recently, but I do. Why don't you marry him? That's a prescription, Doctor. Shouldn't it be in Latin? No, I say marry him right away, in any language. Felix is the future you had planned. Are you going to let a memory break it up? Do you know, Ann? ...you're beginning to live in the past. You're letting the thought of the baby throw you right back to Mickey. ...whom you never really did love. And now, you're romanticizing him, ...you're idealizing his death, ...embellishing his complete and utter defeat. You are so preoccupied with the past that there's no present for you, ...and consequently, there is no future. Believe me, Ann, it's just as definite a disease as diphtheria, ...and you can't treat it with pills. You're the only one who can affect a cure. It is up to you to put the past in its place. Yes. I see what you mean. I do love Felix so much. You are right. I will marry him. It's a promise? Hey! Are you Ann Borden? Why certainly. You know that, Joe. You've known me for 20 years Yeah. But I gotta be official! Your sister Kay just sent out an alarm. She wants to know what's the idea of runnin' off with her boyfriend! Hey, Miss Kay, I found them! You're a great detective, Joe. This town better not have a crime wave. A fine state of affairs. Look at you. Listen, Doc, you know the sentence for kidnapping in this State? No, but I know I have an appointment to go to the movies with the girl on your right. We better hurry up or we'll miss the show. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Pick up Miss Kay Lemp. Her sister Thea says she can't go home until she returns her coat. Oh my goodness! Come on, hurry! Hop in, Ann, I'll drive you folks home. No thanks, Joe, I'd rather walk. - Better walk that-a-way. You just passed Mrs. Ridgefield coming this way. Where should we go? Anyplace you like. Felix. - Yes? Do you believe in long engagements? No, I don't. Neither do I. Quiet! Please! Quiet! A fine time for your voice to change. Just one week before you're supposed to sing at my daughter's wedding. Couldn't you postpone your flowering into manhood ...until after the ceremony? - Yes, sir, I'll try. Very good, let's continue. I was there when he he proposed to her. Yeah? What did he say? - Same old mush. I don't understand why he wants to marry a girl that old! Why? She ain't old. - She's nearly 21. Really? Well, she doesn't look it. Get back to your places! This stick, up till now, has only been used for musical purposes. However- - Yes, sir. Adam, come here. I've something to tell you. Hurry up! Come on. Congratulations. Oh, they're not as good as they're going to be. but they've got a week of rehearsals before Ann's wedding. They can stop rehearsing. Your daughter and Felix eloped this morning. Are you sure? No one has ever doubted my word before! But that beautiful wedding that Thea was preparing for, and her new home... ...and all these preparations... Thea is preparing a meeting of the family for when they return. You are invited. Goodbye, Adam. How did Thea seem to you on the phone, disappointed? At first, but she said that as long as we came directly to her house, for a quiet family gathering, all would be forgiven. That's why I promised we would. Gee, I couldn't stand a mob tonight. Tired? It's quite a job putting the past in its place. Anything's quite a job if you're always working at it. Why should we? You and I have all the rest of our lives to do things in, Ann. Gee, you're swell, Felix Boy, I do love you. Really I do. I always have. Well, Ann. Do you feel equal to it? Anything with you, Felix. Good evening, congratulations. Congratulations and welcome. Bless you, my children. Congratulations. I know you both will be very happy. It's a wedding! Let's take off your coat, Ann. - Felix, I'm glad you're here. Sorry to run out on you like this, Ben. Aw, not at all. It's a greater honor that your first stop ...from the minister's house is our house. I hope you haven't gone to any fuss. No, just a catch-as-catch-can dinner. I bet you haven't any appetite. I'm shaking. Where are the folks? Dad's asleep in a chair. And Aunt Etta's snoring on the sofa. Just a quiet family get-together. A toast! A toast to the bride and groom. With Aunt Etta's blackberry wine. Aunt Etta, I wish you'd let me put this on the market. This is no time to get commercial. Congratulations, my dear. I know you're going to be very happy. If you can stand anymore, I'd like to add mine. Congratulations, Felix! - Thank you, Doctor. I claim the bridegroom. Aunt Etta, I'm a married man?now, but you are still irresistible. Flatterer. May I have the pleasure of this dance? Alright, rug-cutter, I'll jive down the groove with ya! Dance? - I'd rather not. How 'bout a little fresh air? - Say that might help. So you're a party to this conspiracy too? And I'd counted on a quiet evening. - It's all part of the treatment. I do not mind telling you that you are an excellent patient. I expected a quick reaction, but not an elopement. How'd it happen? - Oh, just by accident. I happened to drop in on the children's orchestra Dad was rehearsing. And I said to myself: "No such thing for me". So Felix and I... - No no no. Those excuses are alright to family, but not me. Now give me the real low-down. I overheard Emma, Thea, and Aunt Etta discussing the arrangements. Two trucks of flowers, champagne, a hundred guests... I thought of the time when Mickey and I We married. We were married by a Justice of the Peace who was a bookmaker on the side. Mickey had a dollar and a half and the Judge wanted two, ...so Mickey bet the him on the 3rd race, and lost. Mickey borrowed five dollars from the judge, leaving my watch as security. He said "One day is just like another, so what difference does the exact time make?" We had our wedding breakfast at a coffeeshop, ...then took the bus to New York and went apartment-hunting. We found one. Mickey said it must have been an abandoned gasworks. That was Mickey's wedding. I couldn't get married in style now, because somehow that would have been adding to Mickey's defeat. Do you know what I mean? - Yes, yes, certainly, but... That's all over and done with now. The only direction to face now is the future. Sure, that's right. I promised, didn't I? Is there a doctor in the house? - What's the matter? I feel sick. Desperately sick. Don't stand so close to me, Ann. What is it this time? It's no use, Doc. I've got scarlet fever. Stand back, Ann. - Well, let's see. Too much potato salad, coleslaw, caviar, anchovy paste... No scarlet fever? - No, maybe next time. Stick around anyway, Doc. With all that food, I'm bound to have indigestion. Not you. Something must be wrong with me. Come to the light. Look at my eyes Something tells me that... See, right up in there. Look. Isn't that funny? I proposed to Thea on this very site, when it was the old picnic ground. Thea liked it, I bought it and subdivided it. Naturally we kept the choice spot for our own house. In my wife's name of course. What room is this? That's just a bedroom that we use as a storeroom. It used to be a storeroom. Things just came this morning. Excuse me- I want to talk to Thea about the sandwiches. Excuse us Sit down, sit down. Ben Crowley. Have you gone absolutely crazy? Why didn't you tell me? When's it gonna be? In a couple of weeks. You keep a secret better than any woman I ever heard of. Only a couple of weeks... I'm the happiest man in the world. Don't get excited. It isn't final until they've found out you've paid your last year's income tax. Who's they? - The authorities. They want to know if you can support a child, and furthermore, they want testimonies as to your character. Now wait a minute! I don't mind the government coming in and interfering with my banking business, But that coming to my home and say abou- Sit down, dear, please, be seated. - Ben, be quiet. It is not the Government. It's the authorities from the nursing home, where we're adopting a child. What you've been meaning is that... ...we're adopting a child. Of course. It's much better that way. That's open to argument, that is. No, Ben, it's no use arguing, I have already signed the application and everything. What am I going to tell the fellas at the club? You can pass out the cigars, they won't know the difference. We've got a nursery now, and we've written to a home to fill it. Seems to me it's just like writing to a mail-order house. Darling, I've got a house full of guests, I've got to get downstairs. Destroys a man's initiative, that's what it does. Listen, everybody! Ladies and gentlemen, I have a great surprise for you. Mr. Felix Dietz is going to play his famous composition... ...that won the prize last year. The piano's tuned. There goes my alibi! Before you hear my composition, ... I think you should know that a good part of the credit for its success ...belongs to Mickey Borden. The man who helped orchestrate it. Thea, put on Beethoven's 8th, and we'll all go to sleep. Scallawag. Why, that's beautiful. Did Felix write that, too? No, Felix didn't write it. It isn't even a song. It's only got a middle... ... No beginning... no end... And it didn't win a prize. Mickey Borden wrote it. What there is of it. Stays with you, doesn't it? But Mickey was no genius. The only thing he ever did that came near genius was... ...die young. They say geniuses die young. Well, whaddya say? Let's give these few bars a name. Let's give it a prize of our own! Let's dedicate it to somebody! Before we dedicate it, ...let's see if we can't find a beginning. Everything has one. A song, ...a poem, ...a marriage. Doggone it you invite people to dinner and give them canary feed! Where are those sandwiches I heard you talking about? I warn you. If I'm found starved in your living room, people will talk! Honestly Dad, you eat more like an actor than a musician! I'm pretty hungry myself, what have you in the way of sandwiches? There's nothing in the way of the sandwiches. It's a clear road to the dining room! Alright everybody, into the dining room! I know what's wrong, Ann. I know what I'm up against. Just give me a chance. That's all I ask. Help me? You help me, Felix. Oh, you help me Hello there, you got a cookie? Honestly, I'd like to adopt them all. Every woman who comes here feels the same way. ...but I'm afraid that their husbands would have something to say about that. My husband wouldn't object, he adores babies. Isn't he darling? Hello there, sonny! Hello! Look at that face! Emma! Thea! - Hello, Thea. Thea, darling! Look at the baby, she's smiling. Did you ever see such eyes? Where's Ben? I'm here. How are you, darling? - Hello, darling. I'm glad to see you. Look. Say hello to your daddy, Caroline. Caroline? What kind of name is that for a boy? It's not a boy. She was so cute, I changed my mind at the last moment. Aren't we ever gonna have a boy in this family? Go with Daddy, Caroline, come on. Come with daddy, Caroline. What have you been telling this child about me? Emma, ??will you hold her for just a minute? Ernest, look at her. Ben, will you get me a glass of water. What's wrong with you? A glass of water! Ernest, get Thea a glass of water. The train trip must have been too much for her. Hurry up, Ernest. Ben, I've got something to tell you, but you must promise not to scream. I never scream. Are you sure? Positive. I talked with the best doctor in Chicago. That is wonderful. I've always wanted a son of my own. Why did you have to take this other baby? I had already pledged myself, and she was so cute. Isn't she a jewel? And in all the midst of this excitement, she's stopped crying. Look, Emma, she's smiling at me. Isn't she wonderful? I guess it's us that's wonderful. Here is your water. Are you alright, Thea? - Yes, I'm better. I'm going to have a baby. How does a doggie go? Aw, Emma, I wish we could have a baby like that. Hiya, Lemp. I was just trying to get you at the Foundation. I left a bit early today. Can I help you? - Thanks. This from Matilda, and this is from me. I just talked with him Mr. Phillips by phone. I'll get you a cocktail. He doesn't care how he wastes his company's money, does he? Must own telephone stock. You could've called after seven and gotten the night rate! It would have been too late. He says you've got to be in New York in the morning to start rehearsals. Otherwise the tour's off. Mmhmm. How'd he sound? - Firm. I see. Well, what's to be is to be. Let the fates decide. Heads. Tour's off. I'll start packing... - Oh no no. I tossed and I lost, and I'm not a welcher. He said that another chance like this won't come around again. Not for ten years. I'll be a better musician in ten years. Only the best for Central America. What kind of guy do you think I am, leaving you now? Well, there's Dad, Ben, and Ernest to pace the floor. They don't have my long, rangy stride. I want you to go, Felix. There will be other tours, other concert managers. But I want you to go, Felix. It's your career. It's not your baby. I don't want you to stay. Go, Felix, before you lose, as Mickey did. He threw his life away. You're throwing away everything you worked for. There's nothing I've worked harder for than you, Ann. If only there were something tangible I could fight against, to win you back. If there was something I'd done I could feel sorry for. Or if there was something you'd done I could forgive you for. But I can't fight thin air, ...a ghost. I'm no match for a memory. I've done nothing else but fight for you, Ann. If you send me away now, I've failed. Yes, I'm sending you away. I want you to go, Felix. That's easy for you. I've done all the fighting, you've never even tr- Please, Felix, I can't stand it. Mickey took you away from me once. He's taking you away from me now. But can't you see I don't want you around me? I don't want anyone around me! Why can't people understand that I... I've got to be by myself. Felix, if you love me... - If I love you? There's doubt about that now, is there? The real question is: Do you love me? I'd always thought that at times like these a woman wants people they love to be near them. Maybe it's just an old superstition. If you really love me, Ann, ...you wouldn't even let me go to the corner for a pack of cigarettes. I know when I'm licked. So long, Ann. And don't bother, I'll do my own packing. Come on, Ann, please. Be sensible about this thing, you have to eat something. Of course you have, you can't go around if you haven't had any dinner, you know. There you go, your eggs, just the way you like them. No, really, I could not. You don't know what I'm going through. I've hurt Felix so deeply and I couldn't tell him I was sorry. Now see here, Ann, I want to get this clear in my own mind. Do you or don't you want him to go? Oh, no, I don't want him to go. But I've done enough to him already without ruining his career. ...especially for a child that's not his own. You don't know Felix very well if you think that makes any difference to him. And you won't be ruining his career, if you really love him. It isn't so much the going away that Felix minds, It's the fact that you're sending him away. Why didn't you tell him the truth? Gosh! We women have an awful lot to say on every occasion but the right one. Why did you practically let him sneak out of town? Why can't you be at the station to seem off so that- So at least he knows that his wife loves him. Your sister is right, Ann. And if Aunt Etta says I'm right, something she's not said in 20 years, ...you can see how absolutely right I must be! He must have left already. The only train he could get would be the 8:10. It's 8:05 now. The 8:10 is always late. Perhaps we can still make it. Emma, ??get me my hat and coat, and see that your father's car is all ready. Come on, Ann. Good thing that someone in this family has a steady mind. We needed a new set anyway, they were all chipped. Come on, come on. All aboard! 364 days out of the year... ...that train has been late, and just today... Too bad. Ann! You know, I- Bless you. - 'Scuse me. They say a sneeze is a good sign. It's a girl. A girl? It seems there's a conspiracy to keep males out of the Lemp family! How is she? - Ann's fine. What do you mean, Ann is fine? What about the baby? Well, you know how it is with premature babies. Always a little difficult. No, I don't say it hasn't got a chance. You just sit down for a few minutes here... I'll have some news in just a little bit. Take it easy. A little baby girl- I'm sure glad it's all over. Yes, it's fine. Another girl. Clint, I just got in. How's Ann? Ann's doing nicely, but the baby's having trouble. What do you mean? I'm on my way to get my father's report now. You'd better wait with the family. Are they still here? - Yes. Doctor, how's the baby? We'll have to do a transfusion. Call the head nurse about a donor. Wait a minute. Wouldn't I do? Depends on if you're in the right group. It won't take long to find out. Come on up to the lab. The type's alright, doctor. - That's fine. Alright Felix, let's go. Room 312, nurse. What are you thinking about, Ben? I was thinking about you. You're a pretty nice fellow, Felix. 08:10, is that time? Yes, that is it. Felix, my feet hurt. Here's Clint now. Looks like your blood's done it. The baby's reacting very favorably. That's great. Yes, it's fine. I'll go in and tell the family. Do you want to see Ann? She is awake. No, I'd rather not see her just yet. Maybe you're right. Come on, Ben, I'll buy you breakfast. Some other time, Felix, I want to get home, get a foot bath. Ben, there's something I want you do for me. Oh sure, anything. Anything. I'm going to catch a train to New York... How's the baby? Oh, fine, fine, fine. Out of danger. Oh good. Here look. Right from the commissary. No, I wouldn't care for a sandwich, thanks. It's not for you, it's for me. You know any more about pneumococonosis? Pneumoconiosis. - Do ya? No, not much. It takes time. I will make a little progress, someone else'll make a little progress... ...hundred years, maybe... Anyway, you've just done a great job. Oh thanks. Say! Wouldn't you like it if I got pneumococonosis? Pneumoconiosis? So you could have a handy guinea pig. Hey, how'd you know I like milk instead of cream in my coffee. I noticed it... perhaps. Nothing escapes me. Nothing or no one. Did you get any word from Felix? Nothing but the flowers. Mr. Lemp, you were told to stay out of this room. Now, you know the hospital rules. Only one visitor at a time. Rules are for nurses, not musicians. I'm sorry, but you will both have to go now. Mr. Crowley is coming in. In my day there were fewer rules and more babies. Goodbye, my dear. I'll sneak in again tonight. Oh so you're the only visitor, are you? Hello, Ben. Hello. - Hello, Ben. I thought you might want to hear the stock market quotations. Oh, thank you, Ben. There's a little gadget there on the side, in case you want to turn off the dictators. Oh gee, it's a beauty! I wish I could stay longer, but business isn't that good. That's a perfectly good station. Bye, Ann. - Goodbye, and thanks again. We will now take you to New York City, for the symphony hour. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This broadcast is coming to you from the Rockecliffe Hall in New York. This is the first of a series of concerts conducted by Felix Dietz... ...in this country and in South America. Mr. Dietz will start his concert with "Symphonie Moderne", ...a new composition being played for the first time, ...and written by an unknown composer, Mr. Michael Borden. Mr. Dietz is now coming on the platform. The audience quiets down and settles back in their seats. Mr. Dietz raises his baton. Now we will hear Michael Borden's "Symphonie Moderne". Ladies and gentlemen, the composition is a tremendous success. Mr. Dietz acknowledges the acclaim and the ovation continues. He motions for the orchestra to rise. Calls again to the audience. And now, Mr. Dietz approaches the microphone. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my feeling that the composition you've just heard is truly representative of modern music, and was deserving of a public hearing. It was written about a year ago, ...by Michael Borden. It was his first work. It is his last. For Michael Borden is dead. His tragic loss to the musical world ...you have attested by your sincere ovation. Although his life was brief, it was by no means futile. His legacy to the world... ...is his song, His song that you have so sincerely applauded. And in his moment of triumph, I join with you, in paying tribute to a great talent. There she is, Mrs. Dietz, the fourth on the right. I'll be back in a few minutes. Hiya, Lemp. Hello, Dietz. Is that it? It's not an "it", it's a "she". Cute, isn't it? Hi there! I don't believe we've met, ...but we have something in common, anyway. You've got a little bit of my blood, and I got a scar on my arm. Do you hear that? They're playing your father's song. And what's more, every city on my tour is going to hear it. Can you imagine Mickey Borden right between Beethoven and Bach? I've been thinking about Mickey all day. But not in the way I used to. There's nothing to be bitter about anymore. His life wasn't wasted. Mickey isn't a failure, thanks to you. He orchestrated my composition, I simply did same thing for him. When will you be back from the tour? - Early winter. Let's see, she'll be five or six months old by then. And she won't be an ordinary baby. She'll easily be talking by then, ...and I can introduce her properly to her father. Don't you think it proper that she should be brought up by the two people Mickey loved the most? Mr. Crowley. - Yes, how do you do? I'm Mr. Crowley. Congratulations, Mr. Crowley, You're a father. Is that so? Where is it? How is my wife? Where is my son? How much does he weigh? You're the father of a six pound, six ounce baby girl. It can't be a girl. I had a dream. She's a lovely little girl. I'll let you know when you can see them. How do you do. Mr. Jenkins. - Yes. His wife has just given birth to a lovely boy. They're both doing very well. Jenkins. Better take all this. Just think of it: a son. Thank you very much, but I have three sons. We- We wanted a girl. That little man has a boy. I wish I could see Thea. I hope she's not too disappointed. Ben, Emma and I were just thinking, ...now that you have another baby, ...we've gotten so fond of Caroline, that maybe you might let us take her. You know, adopt her. Ben, congratulations. Can I see Thea now? Congratulations, Ben. - Thank you Doctor. A bouncing girl, seven pounds even. You mean, my little girl has gained ten ounces already? No, I mean the second girl. Another girl? Yeah, you've got twins! Twin girls? Dearly beloved. we are here gathered together here in the face of this company That must be Helen. She's crying. I'd better go. I'm sure it's Caroline. She's crying. It'd better go up. I'll go too. - Not with your hay fever, you won't. That must be the twins crying. I'd better go up. Yeah, I hear them. They got the best lungs in Briarwood. For as much as Clinton and Katharine, have consented together... ...in holy wedlock. ... I pronounce that they are man and wife. Clint. - Joan. Kay! Kay, congratulations. Here, take this one for me. I can't handle both of the twins. Subtitles by jaychris
