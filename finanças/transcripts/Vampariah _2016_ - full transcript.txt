Subtitles by explosiveskull They were once the leaders of this land. They protected it and gave it order. Until their kind betrayed humanity and the ones they were sworn to protect. Once they were revered, now they're feared. The night gives them wings, but they must leave their legs behind for it is their bridge between the world of the humans and the vampires. We are the hunters. We aren't just limited to hunting vampires, but all creatures of the night. We call them, the undead. The team from San Francisco, headed by Marcus Killmore is the most feared troop in the western hemisphere. He's one scary hunter who gets the job done. In case you're wondering, he's not my type. Plus he's a real asshole. Their weapons laved with silver, spice and everything that goes boom. Meat. Can take one of them out. As long as you get them in the heart or take off one of their heads. The rules are different for each type of creature but they all have their weaknesses. The Aswang however is the fiercest and most illusive of the vampire family. Sightings are rare but I got my stakes on one. For generations, the hunters have kept the undead's situation under control. They know to keep themselves hidden, but there's always rebels. As long as the undead are kept away from the human world, balance is maintained. I've been waiting all my life for a chance to slay the Aswang who destroyed my family. My chance is near. Hey HD. I know you really wanna hear this. Hang on one sec. Ah. Mahal are you there? Mahal, are you okay? Mahal, please answer. Do you copy? Mahal please answer. Do you copy? Mahal are you there? What's up? Well, remember that Aswang case you were askin' about? Well I think I've got one. And I can get you in if you want in. You rock. Uh let me just grab fang real quick. He's loose again? You know I wish they'd bury him properly. Or else they're gonna have to keep sendin' you back just to get him, He's the only one that does that. I wonder why. The Kayunchi, they're not so smart. So lure them in with some chi energy. Call me when you're done. Good luck. Alright. Mr Fang I need you to go to the car now, I have a date. The Aswang killed one of those TV hosts you know, one of those shows where they play monster hunter and run around in the dark for hours as if they're gonna find bigfoot? Yeah, one of those shows. My name is John Bates and I have seen many strange things. I want to explain them. Tonight we travel to the Philippines in search of an illusive creature known to the Filipinos as an Aswang. We travel to a region known for it's Aswang sightings. The Aswang is said to be a grotesque creature that feeds on the blood and the viscera of it's victims. Most shockingly, it's also said to feed on the fetuses of pregnant women. And according to the legend, it walks around during the daytime disguised as a beautiful woman. So we found out that some of the locals had actually seen one. We're here with one of the locals now. Tell him, have him tell me, what was his experience with an Aswang? You can hear it sucking. So like vampire, like. Oh yeah vampire. Ah! So my team took a treacherous hike to where our witness said he saw the Aswang. We set up some trap cams and prepared for a night investigation. Got our base camp set up. Time to go get us some Aswang. We split up. Zac at the base camp and I walked along the investigation area. John to base camp, did you hear that? John I'm hearin' all sorts of weird things out here man. Also have you hear from Matthias? I took a pee break and when I came back he was gone. Wait so Matthias was there and now he's gone? Yes sir. Gone? Where do you think he went? I have no idea, it's way too dark out here to see anything. Uh just hold tight, I'm on my way back. John could you please hurry up and make it back here? I'm hearing all sorts of weird noises out here. John to base camp, what the fuck was that? Remember the old man, he told us something about, about the Aswang's upper body flying off? Well I think we found the lower half. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. This was supposed to be, this was supposed to be fake, this was all supposed to be fake. Jeez, oh my god. Friggin' amateurs. Leave it to a real hunter to handle the undead. And you know it serves them right. If I was an Aswang, I'd do the same thing. You don't qualify to be here. Piss off Killmore. With your track record, you're more likely to do more harm than good. Look. When I work, it's best cute ladies like yourself stay outta my way. Might get hurt. Why don't you find yourself a Chupacara to fuck? I already dispatched hunters to the sea Mahal, your services are not needed. You can't honestly assign Killmore to this case. That guy can't take a piss without blowing something up. I know how much this case means to you. But I don't think you're ready. It's the reason I became a hunter, don't do this to me. I know Mahal. If there's anyone in this world that knows how much this means to you, it would be me. You have to trust me. Look, I have been training my whole life for this, I'm willing to take the risk. You know, I don't wanna lose a good hunter like you. But I can't stop you. Thanks boss. I'll be back to clean up after you. You're the Aswang. I saw you I saw you, I saw you out there. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. It was just a show. It was just supposed to be a show. Yeah I've seen it. I heard it's getting canceled. Can I see their cameras? Of all the bodies, was the translator recovered? She was not among the victims. Where does she live? She lived here once upon a time. Maybe she returned to rediscover her past. My father was murdered by this Aswang when he was stationed in the Philippines. My mother died, giving birth to me. Dad? You did this to me. Look at what you did to me. It wasn't me. Look at what you did to me! It wasn't me! This is my curse. I can see the dead, but to them I am their killer. I know what killed my father and I've sworn to avenge him. You did this to me. The Aswang is said to be a grotesque creature who feeds on the blood and the viscera of it's victims. Most shockingly, it's also said to feed on the fetuses of pregnant women. And according to the legend, it walks around during the daytime, disguised as a beautiful woman. You said you'll take care of me. I told you, a baby's not part of the plan. You coward! Yeah hon, I yeah I know, I hate to miss your cookin' too. Yeah well, another late night at the office. Yeah you go to sleep. Yeah yeah, I love you too. I love you, okay bye. Ooh. Hey. Hey! Hey little geisha girl! How 'bout a little of this? Huh? Argh! No thanks. Immigrants pose the greatest threat to our country's security. We need to close our borders for a stronger country that is free of terrorism, crime and disease. Plus, there'll be more jobs for Americans no foreigners. This is Michele Kilman, reporting from the city of evil, San Francisco. Okay, that's a wrap! See ya tomorrow. I can't believe you have the nerve to call me a sell-out. I have no idea why you're denying the facts my Asian sister. I mean the latest internet leaks suggest that you continually support a party that deports and imprisons people currently like us. Me, you, your dad, your momma, sister. Look who you're talking to here. I just don't play the race card like you do. Come on people are missing. Are you seriously trying to blame me for the missing people? The story ready? Michele, you're not gonna believe this. Look. What is it? I think that woman just killed that man with her tongue. Don't be silly. It's probably some new type of Tazer weapon. That comes out of her mouth? Bullshit. We've got breaking news on our hands. You're not serious about running this as a story are you? Are you kidding? This is story of a lifetime. We finally have the chance to prove that the undead exist. Can't pass on this. No seriously, we can't run this, no one will ever believe it. It's probably some computer geek's practical joke. It's right there. Let the skeptics have it, but we have a great story. I don't think you understand, we're not running this. Try and stop me. Be sure to get all the tapes and media files. Yes boss. Latte's ready. You're welcome. Oh sorry. I found this article from Louisiana that mentions killings matching our Aswang. The oldest one dating back to the 1700s. And have a look at this there's more. Well what make you so sure she's even here? You should've did more investigating in the Philippines. No, most of the sightings there are just scare tactics the government uses to distract people during voting time. It's an age old trick they use to scare superstitious people. No. Our Aswang isn't a political figure, she was just visiting. You mean like an undead vacation? Right. The ticket I found had a return flight but she use an alias. I know she's here in the San Francisco Bay area. Somehow she's been here all these years undetected. It seems she may be trying to come out of hiding. Maybe. But. Why? It's time for some action. Okay. You know what, I think you're right. Victim. In the upper age. Male, Caucasian. Oh and get this, cause of death, disembowelment. Okay I'm out. Check in 0800. Ai ai captain. HD has been my only real friend among the hunters. He's always got my back. And his intel will get me closer to my target. Detective. Sucks to be him. Never seen anything like that. Sure the zoo ain't missin' anything? Not that I'm aware of. Who, or whatever did that must've been pissed. You bitch! Look what you did to me. Look what you did to me! You bitch! Why does she only hunt men? What's that? Oh this? This is my name in Chinese. It says Stanley. And yours? That's my history. I see your favorite color's black? Are you like all into vampires or something? Something like that. So um, are you gonna drink my blood? That and more. I like that. Don't tempt me, I might take your offer. Well how about some sake? I don't drink rice wine, I only drink chocolate soup. It's a delicacy where I'm from. That sounds delicious. You have no idea. Let's get outta here. Welcome to the love den. Me so horny. Me love you long time. Oh yeah baby. That's it. Come to papa. Yeah, I'm waitin' for it. Breaking robbery story. I thought it was over, the robbers had the entire bank. Then one of them got edgy, I wasn't fast enough. I thought it was my time. Then there was this light. Tremendous force barreled down these track today. Oh yeah baby I'm waitin' for it come on. I didn't figure for you to just lay there? Oh yeah? That's not how it was with Mathis. Oh did she give it to you good? Don't tell me you forgot. I can't. Wait what are you talking about? She told me what you did. Who? The pretty young bride you paid to come here. How did you know that? She wanted to leave you and you couldn't handle it. She send her regards. What the hell? Oh, oh! What the fuck? Argh! Never send a man to do a woman's job. Salt it a sin, what else you got? Oh look a little knife. I've been waiting for you. Where did you bring me? The person you once were is fading. Dying. Before you cross over, I need to show you something. The day your father died, I smelled an unborn. You said you'll take care of me? I told you, baby's not part of the plan. You want it, you can keep it, but it's not my decision. You coward! It's your baby too. That thing is not a baby. I don't know what that thing is. Are you trying to ruin me? I can take the pain away. Please leave. You know I've chosen this life without the Mannah. If you keep her she'll have a difficult life. No I will love her. I can't, I can't do it anymore! It's not too late to leave this life. Come with me and we can retake what was once ours. Remember what the elders said. An Aswang cannot carry a human child, we'll die. They will create an unbalance in the two worlds. That's the risk I'm willing to take. I can't stop you, but I can stop him. My mother was an Aswang? And your father was a true human. Boring and typical. Unable to recognize our true power. And in the end, you lived. Murdered him. The death of your father brought you here. What right do you have to say that you monster? We were not always monsters. Centuries ago, my mother was a healer and a leader of our community. She gave purpose to our kind. The Mannah were no monsters. The most sacred duty we performed was never spoken of. One day a young girl was brought to us, she was sick and looked as if she was near death. My mother blessed her. I can lift your curse. But if I am to help you, you must not eat anything with salt or garlic. And be sleeping at the center of the house tonight. Do you know what I'm asking you to do? Innah, your training begins tonight. I was a young Aswang so I didn't separate from my legs for night flight. My mother still taught me, our sacred duty for the day would come, when I would have to feed. What right does a man have to force upon a child so young. What choices does she have to make right? But was so very wrong? As shocking as it may seem, not every pregnancy was meant to be. Our kind maintained balance. But when Christianity came to our village, we became the demons that our people feared. We protected them, but in return we were hunted. How did you become so evil? Evil? Evil is in the eyes of the beholder. Haven't you killed someone too? My mother was attacked and killed by the townspeople. Tried to stop them, but a young Aswang is weak. An else of the Mannah stopped me. - Nanai! - No! They musn't know who you are, hide. Aswang! Your mother will be fine. We will reclaim what was once ours. This is one of the benefits of being what we are. An Aswang is hard to kill. And the last thing you wanna do, is be on her bad side. The Aswang's greatest weakness is her legs that allow her to live and walk in a day world. I was chosen to protect her day legs but I failed. Nanai! I no longer have my legs to walk the day. And now you are the one to restore the integrity of the Mannah. Nanai please don't leave me. The world has changed. The village will no longer have our kind. You must leave here and go to the new world. Maybe there you'll be safe and begin your work. It was in the 18th century when I changed my appearance to look like a boy so I can join a crew of a Spanish ship to the new world. The men were cruel, I didn't like them. Taking the lives of people they felt were in their way of conquest. Their blasphemous religion that sent our kind into hiding. I have lived many lives, had many names. But you can call me Bampinay. I've built my life around the belief that the Aswang took my family. But if it were not for the Aswang, I wouldn't be. It seems I have more in common with the ones the hated. Morning sleepy head. I know it's a stereotype but we don't sleep all day. Speaking of your friend Mr Fang, he's sleeping in a catacombs below. Where am I? Home, that's if you need a place to stay. Uh, not that big yet. Give it another 50 years or so. An Aswang's power's earned over time. You turned me into an Aswang? No silly, you always were one. I just woke that side of you up. Side? That's the tricky part. You're half human on your father's side, but let's forget about that asshole. I'm not sure what Aswang powers you'll get but, you should know what good things that tongue is used for. Only time will tell. Will I do that disgusting splitting in half thing? How should I know? I'm not sure you'll get wings either. That'd be kinda cool. So if my father was human then what was your dad? I don't wanna talk about it. Get up. I made you some blood soup. It's pork of course. Finding suitable human meals run scarce these days. Shit. What's up HD. Hey there, it's 0800 and you didn't check in. You know the rules. A hunter goes in the field and goes off the grid, you have to send back up. And I know how much you hate backup. I'm fine. Sorry about not checking in. Not a word about this to anyone huh? You want me to cover for you. Something big must've happened last night. What's happened? You get laid? That is none of your business. Oh I see, I wouldn't wanna interrupt. I guess I'll see you later then. Thanks HD. Sooner or later they're going to find out. They already know. I thought you already had psychic abilities? Best find a new career. The undead signed a pact long ago that we will not hunt others like us. So, I'm fucked? No. You'll be fine. Remember you're Aswang now. We're immortal. We always find ways to survive. I appreciate what you're trying to do really, but I am a hunter. I can't just go around making friends with the undead. I can't make you accept your destiny, but you can't run from what you are. I have to go before they get suspicious. I already told you, they already know. So boss you wanted to see me? I thought Mahal retrieved Mr Fang? Oh well that yeah, she's gonna bring him back when she's finished. Did she tell you when? Well I checked in with her at 0800. I could give her a call, she can come back right away. Don't bother. Important I tell you, I think Mahal has turned. How do you know that? I've seen this many times before. An inexperienced hot shot hunter, going in way over her head. If she doesn't come back herself, consider her dead. I know she was a friend of yours, she was like a daughter to me. You know what you need to do. I'm sorry Mahal. You've reached HD, speak now. I'm sorry Mahal. Kouji what are you doing? Doing a little test. Ah! You know the code. If a hunter joins the undead, they have to kill themselves. And if they don't, someone else will. Get off me! Quick healing, now that's what I'm talking about. You are undead. But I'm not a killer. That's what they all say before the hunger sets in. Now it's nothing personal Mahal, you were a great hunter. You've got a lot to learn. I had this. Really Mahal? You should've killed him when you had the chance. I could've killed him if I wanted to. So what held you back? Sometimes you have to kill or be killed. You're not safe here, come with me. What are you doing here? Why are you doing this? 'Cause I know what you are. And I know what you do! What have we done? We're a peaceful clan. We stayed out of your way. I built this place as a refuge. I don't give a shit you little rodent fuck! That's all of 'em. Good. Looks like she has the hots for me. It's private! Killmore, I have a cleanup job for you. Anything for you boss. Believe it or not I have a day job. We're the best form or birth control. No one ever asks a tiger why it kills. It feeds on the weakest, disease spreading member of the flock and keeps the rest healthy. Your prey awaits. Politicians are so yummy. Sure I'll vote for you. The taste of power and all their hidden secrets. Are you ready for this? Tonight will be your first. Oh yeah, baby. I always wanted two cute Asian girls at the same time. You wanna start? More for me. Come. I wanna dance. Ooh! I'm really sorry I didn't join you for dinner. I can't kill someone like that. Don't feel bad for that asshole, he had it coming eventually. We just beat someone to it. He was a creep sure but did he really deserve to die? Yeah. With all the lost to that man and his greed? You'd understand. He is a cancer. We just acted like white blood cells and got rid of him. Okay. Take an old, unsolved murder mystery like a... Jack the Ripper? Yeah. My friend Vlad, took care of good old Jack. The undead have ways of dealing with their flock. Hold your breath. I told you I'd be back to clean up after you. Killmore. I have to leave you for a moment. Looks like your new friend abandoned you. They think they're gods you know? And I bet you think you're a god too now that you're one of them. Mahal you bitch! The details of the murders are yet to be disclosed, however a full investigation is underway. Earlier today. Well, well now they know for sure that I've turned. You didn't remind you, you were turned. Time to come out to mom and dad. You are such a closet case. Is this all some kind of joke to you? I mean yeah you've been doing this for the past what? 400 years? But it's all pretty new to me. Three, not four. But ain't it fun? No. Do you have any idea what they do the undead if we're caught? We need to do something before they come after us again, we should go somewhere. You should know better than me Mahal. As long as they think that we will make the world aware of the presence of the undead, they'll come after us, no matter where in the world we hide. I'm just tired of playing their games. How about we go take out their headquarters. I have a friend there. That's so cute. Cut it out. The increase in violence we are seeing on the streets of the city of evil is a sign. We need to get rid of all the undesirables who bring disease and misfortune to this country. Who's that? My boss. Don't you watch TV? She's a pretty popular TV personality. She does this to keep the undead situation under control. She's the one responsible for the hunters who attack us? The reason why we live in hiding? Yeah. We will reclaim what was once ours. I knew there were others but I didn't think it was her. She told me that everything was gonna be okay. That we would be strong again and that she'd send for me when everything got better. That was so long ago I just thought she was dead. She betrayed the Mannah. She must've been looking for you. She used you and she betrayed us both. That's not possible, she helped me when no one else would, she helped me become a hunter. That was all part of her plan and you fell right into her trap. Fuck that. You have any other explanation? No, I don't. Seems like I don't know anything anymore. As of yesterday I didn't even know what the hell I was, how should I know why Michele pretended to care? She didn't. She was just lookin' out for herself. Looks like I need to have a heart to heart. That's not a good idea. She's stronger than both of us. I wanna hear it from her and I deserve to know why. Out of my way. Mahal. You'll be a great hunter one day. You'll destroy those Aswangs that did this to your family. I've done everything you've asked. Good Michele, you've come a long way. But you left a lot of loose ends. I assure you, the situation's under control. Maybe you got what it takes, see to it. I will. Puppet master, I need you to wake your friends, we're having company. Got it. Prototypes. Allow me. You're so subtle. You won't need them. Powers out it means they know we're here. Something's coming, I'll hold them off for you. I see you, come to daddy. Mahal! We're not done yet! The knife! Drop it. There. It's better. What are you a vampire now? Suckin' blood, suckin' human blood? Is that what you're doin'? Not gonna need these anymore are you? These are for hunters. But you're not a hunter are you! All you're good at is struttin' around in your sexy little pants. What's wrong Mahal? Doesn't work does it? New issue, it only works for me. That sting Mahal? You ever imagine it'd sting so much? Like pouring salt on a snail isn't it! Where are you goin', where are you going? Come back here Oh you, I see you. Ah! Fuck! Boys and all your toys. This is for Mahal! No! No! Fuck you up! Get up! Like that huh? You like that Mahal? Do you? No no no no no. Unit 12 needs back up. Requesting backup. Unit 12 needs back up. Get down get down get down! What do we have here? Sexy little ass. I bet I know what you like. You like that? Like it huh? Know you do! This what you want? This what you want Mahal? Yeah! You like that Mahal? Ah. You like that? Oh push me off huh? Dare you fucking deny me. Mahal is this what you want? Oh it's like that. Oh come on, give it to me Mahal yeah! Ah fuck! Canther dart? We're hunters, we're immune to these. You know that! You bit me? Bit me! You gonna drink my blood now too? Huh? Come and get it! Kick his ass. Fucker. Mm give it to him good! Oh shit. You crazy bitch! You think that fucking box is gonna stop me? Ooh. Remember you're Aswung now. Oh fuck you! Fucking. Aswangs. Looked delicious. Where were you. Doing my hair, getting my nails deon. Bamp! You were doing fine. I could've been killed. You're right you could've been killed. I need to see you handle this on your own. Why? You passed the first test. We'll talk later. What? She still needs to feed. That's great so do you. So will you. Fascinating. Looks like we have an undead suicide bomber. He was human once. Now he's doing the evil bidding of Michele and her cronies. Must've been one of her secret projects. They did the same thing in the Philippines to scare anyone who rebelled. If you control people's fear you can make 'em do anything. The media will just call it terrorism. She's through here. I can't let you enter. It's me Mahal. I know, but you've turned. No I haven't turned, I'm exactly the same person. Give me a chance HD. I wish I could help you, but I can't. Mahal. You played your part perfectly. Come out and face me! You were the best bait. The undead couldn't resist a little halfling. Ah! You can't win this. Not powerful enough. Let's find out. You disgust me Mahal. What you think? That I really care about the undead? You think I survived all these years playing the undead card? You're a monster! You kill your own kind. Protecting the world from our kind. The undead are a threat to this world's safety. And someday you'll be a threat too. You're just pretending to be something you're not. I've accepted what I am an it doesn't make me less of either. You're not a real Aswang, you disgusting halfling, you're nothing. Pay for that. You're a pathetic hunter and even more as an Aswang. Glad you could join up Bampinay. Or whatever they call you nowadays. Mahal! I'm sorry, is that thing yours? You betrayed the Mannah. You're such a complainer. You'd think you'd move to newer and better things by now. Mother died because of you. Better her than me. Survival of the smartest I always say. Argh! Two things. You are not that smart and you're not going to survive this. You're pathetic. What? Are you afraid now? Ah. Smoke this bitch! Hold you fire! Hold your fire! There's a hunter in the room. Where's that punk bitch Killmore at? Why don't you ask the Aswang? It's a little late for that. You make an ugly Aswang. Nice outfit. Yeah well, thought I'd give it a try. Let's end this. The sun's almost up! Relax, it's not dangerous until it's fully raised. You're not separated, what are you worried about? You're flying! Get us home in one piece please. You gotta learn to trust me. How'd you get HD to call the reinforcements? You know men can't resist my charm. Besides, that Hack Daddy of yours is such a sweetheart as long as he's not playing with all his toys. Thanks. You did good. Without Michele and the rest of them we actually have a chance to take it to the next level. What if I'm not ready for the next level. You saw what they do to our kind. We're Aswang, we can do anything. You wanna end up all crazy like Michele? That won't happen to us. It's like you said, no one asks why the tiger kills but that's not going to stop them from hunting it. I guess there's nothing we can do. You're dead. Looks like we're not done with her yet. You're mine now. Bamp! Bampinay! Now it's my fault, it's garlic yours! Mahal! You're not gonna get a second chance, this is your undoing. No. This is your undoing. Ew. Gross. No. No. No! No! Mahal. You're gonna be okay. You didn't like her much did ya? No. She was hot. But she was a bitch. By accepting what I am, I left my old life behind. I know I can't go back. But I found I have a new purpose. Subtitles by explosiveskull
