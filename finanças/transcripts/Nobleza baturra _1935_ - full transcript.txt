You tell me what's to be done with Uncle Eusebio's flock. Again? Hey, I thought you were joking. What? We should really fire shots to drive away the animals? Let's go, then. But... - Have you thought it through, master? - I think everything through. So do what you're told, or else... Whoa, Shepherdess! Whoa! Chestnut! Pilar! Wait! Whoa! Whoa! - They won't let our flock through. - Who? José, the servant of Marco. Pay no mind, and leave the flock where it is. Sure thing! Hey, pay no mind to him. Leave the flock where it is. Sebastián! Sebastián! Ay! - What a fright you gave me, buddy. - Weren't you calling me? Yeah, but I didn't think you were so close by. Hey... what were you doing over there? Having a smoke. Well go to the threshing ground. I'll go see to the flock. - Wait... - I won't. To the field, go. Boy... They'll see us. Who? - My father'll be here any minute. - Your father? He must be at least five leagues away. Sure... or the people. I don't care about the people. Well I do. Of course... because you don't love me. Because you don't love me. What do you want, that I go trumpeting it around town? And then what? My father'd throw you out in the street. And I'd find work somewhere else, in peace. And we couldn't see each other like we do now. Now you see how it's you who doesn't like me? You're right, darling. We have to hang on. And all because you're rich and I'm poor. Damn whoever invented money. Hey, are you going to fire a shot? I'll do as my master told me. Pilar! Pilar! Pilar! Hide yourself, lad, hide. Come on, man, hide! Not so fast, greedy. You'll choke. What a face you've got on, lad. And your aunt? She wouldn't be in the field, would she? She'll be by the oven, gossiping, as though she had been. - Filomena! - What? Give me a wet rag to wash these little ones. With water? - Would wine do, lass? - Sure. Come here, boy. Come on... Hey! Don't suck on it, lad. You'll get drunk that way. It's rancid. - Filomena! - Yeah! Off with you, boy. Hey, lass, can you get us a morsel of something to wash down this wine? Yes. And then you'll ask me for some wine to wash down the morsel. If you're not grazing all day, you aren't happy. What'll it be? See? The handsomest boy in town and the dirtiest. When you go out into the street as you did before... I'll mistake you and your mother for hogs. - Have you had snack yet? - No more than once. - And you all? - Same as him. - You must be hungry, then. - Of course! Of course. Filomena. - What do you want? - Take these ones to have snack. They never stop their begging. At least they don't ask us for wine. All right, come with me. - Go on. - Ah! And cut those guys a few slices off the ham leg. But thin ones, eh? They're not that hungry. - Not hungry, are we? - Pay her no mind, Pilar. Who told you that? Hey, lass, did you get a good look at the guys who were shooting at the flock? Why? Did you see if Marco was taking shots? What difference would it make if it were Marco or his servants? It's all the same. Sure, it's the same, but... You know what I'd tell you, father? Leave that matter for now. The fault lies with us for having brought our flock onto land that wasn't ours. By sending them elsewhere the matter was settled. Where are you going? Where? Oh, yes, to the barbershop. Sebastián! Domingo! Sebastián! My father's going to look for Marco because of this morning. Follow him, but carefully. You know how Marco plays. Don't worry, lass. To tangle with your father they'll have to kill us all. Well, go on! You, Sebastián, stay here. I'm not staying. I don't like that Marco. Hold your horses, lad. Go on inside. And obey. That's why I'm the mistress, understand? Go, go, to work. Go on, cut firewood for tonight! We'll see, Uncle Reba! One more glass, and you take another peseta. Boy! Go on, you'll win a coin! Andrea, fill five glasses. Five glasses? And not a drop more. You, uncle dummy, can't you see he wants to get you drunk? José, get a half-pitcher of the La Pascuala. Come on... Of La Pascuala? That's just about enough. After all, what do I care about all of you? There you have it, and I hope you all burst! I was looking for you, Marco. For me? Well here you have me, for what you want. For what I want, no. Because if it were for what I wanted, right now you'd be getting beaten like a dog. Why do you say this to me, Uncle Eusebio? Why? Weren't you the brave guy who was shooting at my flock this morning? Me? You! Who else could it be?! And what are you all doing here? Who sent you? No one, master. We came to have a drink. But at home they give you everything you want. Get out of here. And hurry. Hey, you, José, What is it Uncle Eusebio says they've done to his flock? Pardon me, master. I know that you know nothing about this matter. It was my doing, Uncle Eusebio. What my master told me is not to let any animals graze on his land. And I followed my master's orders. I don't know if I did good or bad, but I'm here for the consequences. So you think you can just... Leave it, Uncle Eusebio. I'll deal with him myself. Seems in my house, everyone's got more say than the master. Get on, go. You make me want to break your face. And you all, get out too. Have they done you much harm, Uncle Eusebio? - Five head. - Five head? Well then give him the same number of the best... go! These people... if one gets out of line, he wants to be more a master than the master. It seemed strange to me. It's fine, pal. Sorry for everything I might've said. Hey, Uncle Eusebio. Think nothing of it. You can say anything to me. Always at your service. Good, Uncle Eusebio. To have thought that I... Girl, Andrea, get a glass for Uncle Eusebio. Hey, no animals can graze on your land... That won't do, lad. Look here, Uncle Eusebio, the truth is, I like to speak clearly and with all frankness, since we're both from this land. You may not let your flock onto my land, nor may you take advantage of the irrigation of La Solana. But hey, what about your father's word that he gave me? There's nothing written down, but his word is his word. I know that. And I follow all of them that he gave. And my own. But when I follow, so must others. What do you mean? Is there something I didn't follow? What a bad memory you have. But leave it alone. No, no, no, no, out with it. Right now. Don't you remember, Uncle Eusebio, when your daughter and I were children? Sure I remember. They all teased us, and you most of all. I remember you would say many times to my father: "Your son for my daughter, and there's nothing more to say." And every time you'd say that, I too would think that there was nothing more to say, that that had to be true, above all else. And, little by little, Pilar was getting deeper inside me. And now, you can see it. Seems like you all have changed. Not me, I'm always the same. - But have you said anything to her? - For what? She gets like a hedgehog when I'm around. Anyone would say she's in love with someone else. Listen, have you heard anything? I don't know, but people talk... But who knows? What do they say? That they've seen her a few times on her way to the river. Who? Pilar? But with who? I don't know. No one says anything about who it could be. You think if I knew...? - Think my daughter's capable...? - Hey, Uncle Eusebio. You'd better ask her that. She'd know better than I would. - No, you have to tell me. - I don't know more than what I've said. Girl, pour me another glass. You could be right. I don't know why I get this way. Gossip is nothing more than gossip. Let's be clear. Do you like my daughter? As you can see. Well I'll repeat what I used to tell you when you were little: "My daughter for you, and there's nothing more to say." Understand? And you know that when something gets into my head... Hey, Andrea, get us more wine. Toot, toot. Why don't you move aside? Did you see, Abd el-Krim, how he had to move aside? ♪ Even if your mother's seen me, ♪ even if your mother's seen me, ♪ the big mule and the farm, ♪ I married you. Hurry up, Abd el-Krim, you're asleep! There's your boyfriend, lass. Perico! Whoa, donkey! Whoa! Oh, Virgin! He'll throw him off! Whoa! Whoa, donkey! He threw him! Hang on... hang on and let's see if I've broken any bones. No, I haven't broken anything. Come on... come on... look what you've got. It takes being all the donkey that you are. - Oof! - What is it? The meringues! I've lost the meringues! Oh, my god! Oh... No... look, here they are. These are meringues? - Yes. - They look like wafers. It's just... it's just they got deflated in the fall. And how was Zaragoza? Pretty nice. Right, you? You didn't forget a single order? I don't think so. Here. Take this paper. You read while I review it. Three handkerchiefs. Here they are. A half-dozen glasses and a packet of candles. - It should say "bullets". - Could be. Because this could be an "e" or an "a". Yes, but the first letter is a "v". Yes. And this was written by the priest, who knows a lot about writing, and because, what's more, "candles" is written with a "b" as in "donkey", so what Father Juanico ordered is a packet of bullets. Continue. Pick up the rope from a well and put it on a clock. That one's a bit strange. Give it here. Those are two separate commands. Here's a halter for the mayor's donkey, and here a padlock for the secretary's pigpen. Here, read. A St. Anthony of the most miraculous type to be found. Look. There it is. And me? Did you bring me anything? I believe I've got it here. Look. A stick? Of ash wood. This works for everything. For mattresses, for the steed, and for you. I also brought you... Look. Perico... You have to start setting up a house, lass. Hey, don't tell me that. You'll make me blush. What has to be, has to be. - You get how you get. - Leave me alone! What do you think, steed? The day you fall in love, I'll give you a beating that'll break your back. So you won't be such an ass as I am. Hey girl! Filomena! Girl, Filomena! Leave me alone. - Don't be angry, woman. - Stay back, I tell you. - Come here you sweet lump of jelly. - Get off, you big hunk of stupid. Look, come here. I'm going to give you a little message. You think it's decent that I find you here... pecking at each other like birdies? And that's a sin? For the birdies, probably not. For you all, yes. And for the grown-ups. For the grown-ups, Father? Because if you didn't show up and cough, he'd bite me. Well, you brought my my order from Zaragoza? There, I brought it in the side-bag. But tell me, Father, what do you want with so much ammo? To give them to the Virgin. Well then, what a shoot-up you'll have at the church. What shoot-up? I'm wondering if you haven't brought me rockets... instead of candles. Candles? I'm coming! With your permission, I'll go over there. They're calling me. And me too, Father, me too. Go with God. And be careful what you do. Lass, if you don't need anything else, we'll get going. Nothing else. Thank you. Thanks to you. See you tomorrow. Go with God. Come on, go with them. Wait, lass. Let me stay a little while here with you. Alone? Be together alone? Alone or with company, I don't care either way. You don't care either way if we're alone or with company? Look, get out of here right now. Fine, woman... Of course I prefer us to be alone. Aha... Hey, and why is it that you prefer us to be alone? To take advantage, huh? To take advantage! Look, you're already leaving. Fine, woman, fine. Listen, and go home without passing through the town square, got it? Sebastián! If you sit here real still, I'll let you stay a while. All right. Come here, silly. Oh no, my father. Boy, here comes my father. Let go. Don't talk to me, lad! Don't talk to me or I'll swat you again! Must be that Filo. If you come in, I'll tell my cousin you broke my pitcher! Who were you quarreling with? Who would she quarrel with besides this priest? It always has to be the same... There's nothing better than a scolding, lass. Don't you see that after scolding you have to make up... and then come caresses and kisses. Well, you are you, for sure. Well that's why Filo scolds me, to make up, lass, to make up! I'll have to swat you again! Well, not in front of me, because I'm leaving. What for? So you can make up, kids. So you can make up! See? There's nothing more to say, is there, Uncle Eusebio? What for? As you know, when I get something in my head... My daughter for you. Why do I have to repeat it to you? And we stay where we stay, right? We'll put it together on Sunday. You bring the gang and I'll take care of everything else. See you later, lad. Goodbye, Uncle Eusebio. Lass! Pilar! - Were you calling, Uncle? - To Pilar. I don't know where she went. Girl! Pilar! Pilar! Who's calling? Ah, you're here, Father? Come down, there. Hey, what did I tell you, lass? It wasn't Marco's fault, what happened this morning. Well there you have it. If you saw how he handled those who did it... How you smell of wine. You didn't come from the barber, Father. But it seems they did fleece you. Me? Hey, you, I haven't had wine, nor has the man been born who could fleece me. All right, Uncle, let's see. Oh... Let's see, let's see... Oof! It's rancid. The stuff from Andrea's. Be too fond of the tavern and see what happens. At the drop of a hat I'll go with my aunt. All right, woman, all right. Two little cups, nothing more. I was talking to the boys about the party we're going to throw on Sunday. What party? There'll be a party? A big one! Even the pigs will be dancing! There'll be Santiago, the guy from Romeral... Benito, the uncle of One-Eye, and Marco. Do you need anything, Master? Nothing, Sebastián. You'll come too. Tell everyone in the village who'll hear you that what they say about Pilar is a fantasy, that's been invented by jealous ones. And if they want to lay their eyes on my daughter, they first have to put them on her father. It would be nice if some shabby man wanted to take her away. Very well. Bye, everybody. Hey, Sebastián! And don't forget that the flock can't be on Marco's land. Yes, well? That is completely settled. And about the irrigation too. All right, father, let me settle it with that one. Hey, why'd your father say that to me? No reason, same as if he'd said it to anyone else. I don't know, it seems like he said it to me on purpose. - Let him say what he will. - Your father's so hard-headed. Even more than me. - You know what I say? - What? While they can raise a mountain between us, we just have to use our nails to dig a long tunnel and meet in the middle. Fine, lass, fine. Goodbye. A couplet has come to me that I'll recite to the drugstore gossip on Sunday. God made the world in seven days, on the seventh day went on the nod.

Give us a moment to have the good luck of looking at you. You're joking, aren't you? - Does it bother you? - On the contrary. There's nothing I like more than to see people having fun.

Listen, what do you want to talk about? Is it true what they say? What do they say? That you have a boyfriend. They don't say anything more? Think that's a small thing, lass? - Very small, lad. - And...? Who is he? Who? My boyfriend? Well... ask around at the drugstore. They know all about that. The drugstore and everyone... they don't know more than that you're seen every day at sunset, with a man... by the riverbank. And what else? - Think that's a small thing, lass? - Very small, lad. Well... he can't have good intentions, that man, when he hides himself so. Who? Your boyfriend. Look, Marco, you know what I say? You go like dove, but you stay with the sheep. When will you answer what I've asked you? You want to have a laugh, do you? Well, you will, because you don't scare me! Let me pass or I'll break every tooth in your head! Do as you like... but you won't pass. By force? By force! I wouldn't like anything more at this moment... than to see a man stand up for you. Well look, lad, you couldn't find him quicker than this.

Who are you to order me around? A man who's more of a man than you. More than me? Let go! Leave me alone! Be still! And shut up! You, upstairs. Upstairs! And you, come with me!

It seems that Marco, from La Solana, had decided to court her. She despised him, and he told her... I don't know what. So... Sebastián came to defend her, and, if it weren't for Father Juanico, they'd have had a brawl. Who's this yellow ointment for? Ah, you for you, right? 40 cents. But what's this proud girl thinking, despising good suitors? All this appearance of being so contemptuous and honest... That raises my suspicions. To defend that proud girl! And who told Sebastián to defend anyone? She can defend herself! She... she and no one else is the one who was to blame. You're telling it as it is... I tell you, that's how the girls of today are. - You're right... - If these things happened before... You say Father Juanico danced the jota in front of the whole village? Yes, yes... Blessed Lady of the Pillar! What's happening to the clergy? The gang has come out!

All right, let's go! How lucky you are. Lucky, no. It's because we play better than anyone in the village. OK, OK, OK... Let's play one last one, but for real.

I need you, you know? - At your command, master. - Let me explain it. You don't have to explain anything, just what I need to do. Well, listen good. I just passed by the drugstore and saw Uncle Eusebio with the priest and the druggist, finishing their card game. This has finished you off. But why are you angry? Because. Tell Pilar to come see us! - Same from her. - Very good. That girl, if she listened to my advice... One woman can't give advice to another, Mrs. Paula. And a man? A man? Neither. Even if he wears a cassock. But how do you manage to beat me every night? Good night! Bye-bye! - Our regards to Pilar! - Thanks from her. Go on, José, and remember it. Don't worry... God be with you, Uncle Eusebio. What brings you out at this hour? First, that you forgive me about the other day in La Solana. Hey, man, forgiven. And then? Then, my master asked that you give me the accounts that the mayor brought you. I have them upstairs. Come with me. Why don't you send them to me with Filomena? I'm beat from walking all day in the mountains. All right, I'll send them to you. See you tomorrow, lad. Thank you, Eusebio. I'll wait here. My uncle's here! Go on, out to the street. I'm dead tired. Perico, take these papers to José. He's waiting out there. Yes, sir. Wait for the boys making the rounds, and distract them when they look this way. Don't forget about the whistle. It's so dark. Blow out the lantern. No. I'm afraid of you, so... Blow out the lantern, I tell you! You blow it out. I'm embarrassed to. Hey, here, the papers. ♪ Oh, the young girls... ♪ Tonight I'll go out carousing... - Let's go behind to see who he is! - Let's chase him! Why trust innocent types? Hey, could be a thief! A thief? Tomorrow, when Uncle Eusebio gets up, nothing will be missing from the box. Go on, to the tavern. I'm treating! He must be none other than the one who goes to the river every evening. - Very likely is. - Who else could it be? But is that true, lads? Of course... About Pilar... Two eyes can be fooled, but see how many of us there are. Now I see why that proud girl has despised so many young men... to make us trust appearances. Hey, lass! Pour us some glasses so we can continue the rounds. Hold on. Tonight, the town shouldn't sing more than a single couplet. Which one, lass? This. Listen well so you'll learn. Let's hear it... 'round about midnight, they say that they saw a man drop from the window of Maria del Pila'. Repeat it, lass, so we can learn it! Repeat it! 'round about midnight... 'round about midnight, they say that they saw... they say that they saw a man drop from the window... a man drop from the window of Maria del Pila'. of Maria del Pilar. ♪ How it shows, young woman, that you're in love with a young man. ♪ How it shows... ♪ How it shows that you love with passion. ♪ With passion that you hide with fervor, ♪ how cautiously you are silent, in love. ♪ With love, how sadly you wait, with pain. ♪ With pain humble and soft, with the valor of the Aragonese. ♪ How it shows... ♪ How it shows that you're in love, lass. ♪ The dove, which, in its wings ♪ carries the sign of lead ♪ that hurt her... ♪ tells the air of her sorrow and pain. ♪ And the trembling whisper ♪ returns to the gentle wind ♪ the illusion... ♪ to feel the tender yoke of a love. ♪ Of a love that will make you forget him, ♪ which, in its wings carries the lead ♪ that hurt her. ♪ How it shows that you're in love, lass. ♪ How it shows that you are, young woman, ♪ in love with a young man. ♪ How it shows... Come on, Pilar! We'll be late! Huh? What does it say here? "'round about midnight, they say that they saw... a man drop from the window of Maria del Pila'." Ah... boy things. Go on, woman, we'll be late to the rosary. You mean you didn't know? Why, by now the whole village knows. - Who told you? - Someone. I did nothing more than leave the house, and I heard about everything from the people I met. Last night there was no talk of anything else: about the window, about Pilar, about the man who jumped out of it. About how he was seen by more than 90 fellows. - 90? - Seems like a lot of fellows. We'll leave it at 80, but I won't go any lower. And they say the young man was dangling from a rope, and that Pilar was holding it from up above. And that, upon him reaching the ground, she blew him a kiss with her hand. What are you looking for? The wine-skins. Whose wine-skins? Why, whoever's they are. Look's like everything's wine and dandy here! No two ways about it! Where did you see it? Hey! Cover my donkey, so you can see its ears. There's no donkey here but you! Hey, how could they say those things written on the door? Leave that foolishness, lass, and let's hurry on or we won't arrive.

Did you invent the story going around town? What story? - From the couplet everyone's singing. - God save me, lad. Yeah, the couplet's mine, but the boys making the rounds told me the story at my place. Well they lie and so does the couplet. It's what they said. Here they are. Hey, didn't you fellows make the rounds last night? Yeah, me and these two. Well, tell Sebastián what happened. He doesn't want to believe it. Well it wasn't one or two of us who saw it, there was at least a dozen of us. Look, first he dropped a leg, and then the other, and when he grabbed the wall, he slid down until he touched the ground and then ran off like a hare. Seems it was Sebastián who slipped out. Not for lack of wanting to, eh, lad? Yeah, the girl's ready and willing. Hey, Sebastián, tell Pilar all of us know how to climb. She only needs to ask! All right, leave him alone. And you, sit down. Forget it. Pay them no mind. But listen, for you to get this way you would have to be... Was she your girlfriend? And you loved her a lot? And loving her that much was capable of... There's no forgiveness from God. What's that? You're crying? Are you crying, lad? You think it was me who made up that couplet. I'm sorry, Sebastián. Forgive me. If I had known that you... Quiet. This woman doesn't deserve a single tear of yours. Why did you have me come here, Father? Go to see the Virgin while I finish up praying out here, and then we'll talk. Father Juanico called you here, didn't he? Me too. Sebastián... What's wrong? If you knew what I was seeking... When everyone was hounding me with slander... I had only one thought: to find you so that you could defend me. But what's wrong? We won't be apart anymore, you know? And we'll tell anyone who wants to know that we love each other. And my father first. Now... Now, yes. You can't see how much more I've suffered. Now they can't me suffer anymore. When everyone sees how much we love each other, they'll realize that all that the couplet says is a lie. Everyone, yes... but me? You? You what? Who will prove to me it's a lie? But you need proof of that? That I'm honorable? Oh, my Virgin... Our love, Sebastián... Why would we talk about this? Why would we talk about love? My God, but... you and I have never known how to talk about anything else. In three days you've had time to prove to everyone that they are lying. To me first. In three days. You're right. But I haven't been able to do anything but suffer. What proof can a woman give to demonstrate that she's honorable? There may be some... But I can't think. Think for me, Sebastián. Don't remember our love if you don't want to, but think about my honor and defend me, Sebastián. About my honor... about my honor... Goodbye, Father Juanico. What? Goodbye and nothing more? Nothing more. What do you want me to tell you? Nothing, lad, nothing. If you have nothing to tell me, go with God, for as long as you want. Pilar is still there. Yes, I know. There she is. She wants me to defend her against the village. And you? What? Me? What am I going to do? Tell me. I won't say anything. But you've loved her very much. Very much. And you love her. If you love her in spite of everything, you have to do something. I can't offer you a miracle, because we priests don't do that. But I've heard tell that love always performs miracles. I don't understand any of that, but you must understand it. Isn't that right, lad? What do you mean to say? Nothing. Nonsense. Go on, go with God. Refresh your head over there, press well on your forehead, and see if something occurs to you. Go with God, lad. Go with God. Come on, Abd el-Krim, bray so Filo will come out. But hard, eh? My boyfriend's here. What's with you, in such a hurry? Me? Nothing. I tell you it was him who brayed. Well, what do you want? Nothing. Abd el-Krim wanted to see your face. And now he's seen you, so hey, hey. Now you can go! And you came here for that, animal? Oh, how sweet you are, lass. Here, Abd el-Krim, you have a bite too. Hey, be still, man! Be still, I say! My cousin is waiting for me! Girl! Pilar! Girl! Who would have closed this door? Was it you? No. How strange. Uncle! Uncle Eusebio, did you lock the door to my cousin's room? Wait. Oh, uncle, how frightful. Thank you, lad. Apothecary! "Apothecary, canary, with wiry legs, you've got a starving husband who begs!" Come in so I can give you a laxative. I'd forgotten that you hadn't had breakfast. Hey. Step carefully so they don't hear us. As I was telling you, it's all very clear. I think someone's calling. They can wait. It turns out it was Sebastián who who jumped from the balcony to burgle. How do you like that? And we who were suspicious of poor Pilar. I was so surprised to hear it. You were? So was the rest of the village. How relieved Mr. Eusebio must have been. You can imagine, lass. Let's see, Abd el-Krim, tie up this fly with your tail. You think Sebastián is a thief? If you say yes, I'll give you a blow that will stun you. No, huh? No, I already knew, that you and I, the two of us think the same way. Who would have suspected Sebastián? Seemed like such a good boy, didn't he? These days you can't trust anybody, much less men. Nobody, lass, nobody. And is he feeling very bad? Well he should be, Mrs. Rufa. Please give me a laxative for this guy. What? A donkey in my house? - No, two. - Why two?! Your husband and him! My husband?! Shameless! Cad! Witch! "Apothecary, canary, with wiry legs..." What are you doing, not giving her medicine? No, medicine for me? No. Perish the thought. And what brings you here, Mr. Eusebio? To say goodbye. Are you leaving the village? For Zaragoza. Father Juanico has insisted when we go to thank the Virgin for what happened to Pilar. So we're going. Your daughter must be very happy. Happy? Shoot! It seems that she has had another upset! How strange... No. You're not capable of committing burglary, Sebastián. I know very well... that all you've declared to the judge is a lie. You haven't stolen, nor was it you who jumped from the balcony of María del Pilar that night, as the couplet says. What are you insinuating? That you were the boyfriend of María del Pilar. That last night her father surprised you in her bedroom, and you pretended you were robbing them to save her. And you, who love her, you think her capable of that? When a woman is really in love... Not even. She loves her own honor more than anything in the world. Look, Marco, it's true that I faked the robbery to save her, but to save her from something else, from the slander that the village made into a couplet. Even knowing that you'd lost her... because with that, you lost her forever. Were you capable of such a sacrifice? She asked me, crying for her honor, and there was no other way. But what sort of man are you, Sebastián? A man like you. Not like me, lad. Not like me. Look... I'm going to leave the village this evening for a long time. When you know that I've left... open this letter. Whoa! Giddy up! Hey! - What?! - I beg your pardon, Father, it's just that I go everywhere with my donkey. I miss him very much. And since you're just like him... - What? - No, I mean you're both black. Well, your cassock. Go on, you sod. It's you, Marco? I've come to see Sebastián. Well done, lad. Very well done. That's how men do it. - See you later, Father Juanico. - Goodbye. Whenever you want. You don't have to close it. Once again, the cell is empty. Here. Give this letter to the judge. Well, Sebastián, I'm glad that you didn't break everything. Bye-bye. So you saw, lad, that everything I told you was true? That love can perform more miracles than a village priest. Come closer, my lady. This one has done his duty as a man. Now you have to do your duty to him. You still need to tell him... who it was who jumped from your balcony that night. Don't be afraid, my lady, I won't sing you the couplet. He's the one who's going to sing it to you. We'll see... Would you be able to swear before the Virgin that what the couplet says is a lie? You know I could. And you would believe that oath, right? Yes. Thanks, you kids. You've done well.
