♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mia ♪ Aw, she's still asleep. Oh, well, I'll just have to eat all those pancakes myself then. Tricked you! Happy birthday, Bunny. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Mum? - Mum? - Hmm? You're burning them. Oh, Jesus. Here you go. Ta-da! Oh, okay. Here, put that on. Looking forward to your party? - Is Daddy coming? - Yeah. - And Denise? - Mmm-hmm. Toby, your dad, Denise, everyone. Not everyone. Not Grandpa. I miss him. Yeah, I miss him too, Bunny. - Two dolphins, yes. - Yeah? And the blue one I like the most, 'cause he can camouflage in the water, and he has a beanbag to himself. Okay, well... And has only a cushion and a beanbag. Bye-bye, Mummy! Bye, sweetheart. How's work? Oh, it's okay. It's work. Ready. Great. Okay, I'm just gonna place the probe. That's it. Just looking for the sac and the fetal pole, and... That, Jordie, is a little heartbeat. Oh. Yeah. No. You better not be doing what I think you're doing. Uh, Mia? Is Joan coming? What? To my party, is Joan coming? Uh, what makes you think that Joan might be there? I miss her. Isn't it a bit hard to miss somebody if you've never met them? I miss people I've never met all the time. Mummy, why's the door up? I don't know. Mum, look what I got! Aren't you cute! I know, I know, I know, I know. You're so cute. I love you. Uh, it's probably just escaped from someone's backyard. But she was sitting here, waiting for me. Um. Is that from Daddy? No. He's coming tonight, remember? Who's it from? It's for me. - Another card about Grandpa? - Yeah. I'm gonna call her "Rabbit." They're here! There's my birthday girl! - Happy birthday, sweetheart! - Hi, Daddy! - Ah, it's pouring a gale out there. - Come in, come in. - Does he need something? - Oh, he's fine. I just picked him up from his dad's. He didn't want to leave. Where's Denise? Um, she's coming straight from work. She'll be here soon. I love you. I'm gonna have to put posters up. Or you could let her keep it. How've you been coping? Hmm, good. Yeah? Well, I saw all the boxes. What? The boxes in the garage. - When I went to check on the kids. - Hmm. I hope you'll tell me if you're ever... not good. Dinner's ready! Maybe we should just cut the cake. I'm so sorry. She's... She's two minutes away. I'm so sorry. I'm really, really sorry about this. How are you guys? How's Denise? Uh, yeah, good. Good. Um... Yeah. We, uh... Hmm? - What? - We... We... are trying for a baby. I thought Mia was gonna be an only child, and we agreed upon that. You agreed. Hmm. - Hello? - We're in here. - Hi! - Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hi! - Hey. What did I miss? Well, apart from dinner, nothing. Just... - Kids downstairs? - Yeah. - Hey. - Pete was just telling me the good news. Yeah, right. I'm thrilled, actually. It'll be more work, but the pay is fantastic. - And, frankly, I was done... - Oh, no, no. That... That you guys are trying for a baby. Oh! Mia? Mia? It's okay. I'm coming, honey. - Mum! - Mia? You okay? Toby hit me. What? Are you all right? - You... You don't hit! - Sarah! Sweetheart, let's see. Here, let me see. He's only three, Mia. He doesn't understand. - You little shit. - Jesus, Sarah. - Hey! Don't hit! - Sarah! Sorry. Is that a birthday cake I saw in the kitchen? Why don't we go and have some cake? Yeah. Yeah. Come on, darling. Sorry. He is a little shit. Yeah, piss off. Yeah, go on, fuck off. Go on. Ow. God. What is that? I made it. Mia, you have fur all over you. - Can you take this off, please? - Don't! Oh, well... Love you, Bunny. This is Sandy McLennan from Warrendi Nursing Home. Dr. Gregory, we'd like to meet with you to discuss your mother Joan's condition. In person, if possible. Can you please get in touch to arrange a time? Thank you. Hi. Sorry. - Sorry. - Uh, you're welcome to call ahead. Yes. Yeah, I was driving. Sorry. - Um, what... Uh, where is she? - She went out to play. She's with Nowa. Okay, um... Fuck. Where's Mia? Um, she was just here. Uh-huh? Mia? - Hey, Tubby, have you seen Mia? - No. You know, you can always tell me if there's someone bullying you, Mia. Is there someone bullying you? Sure? Why won't you tell me why you were so upset today, Bunny? Sweetheart? I miss her. Who do you miss? My mummy. Oh. Mia. I'm your mummy. You know that. I'm right here. Do you mean Denise? Uh... All right, Mia. Hop out. Gotta get ready for bed. Guess who? Um, can you take that off, please? Who was on the phone? Uh... Nobody. A ghost. Yeah, maybe. Come on, homework. So we have to put the trunk in the family tree about here. Mmm-hmm. And all the people are the leaves. Okay. You know Grandpa? Hmm? How he died... Yeah. And we went to the funeral. Mmm-hmm. Was Joan there? Uh... No, she wasn't, Bunny. Why not? Well... Uh, she lives very far away. We need to stick photos in too. How far away? Did you say photos? - Yes. - Can't we just draw the pictures? I need photos. Well, I'm gonna need them back. Where's Joan? Um... - I don't have any photos of her. - Why not? I haven't seen her in a long time. I don't stay in touch with her. Why not? Well, that's just the way it is, Bunny. But I need a photo of Joan. Maybe Grandpa had some in his boxes. Hmm. He might. Please. Um, you know what? Maybe we can look tomorrow. But not tonight. I've been looking for that. - Hey! - That's not for you. - What are you doing out of bed? - It's mine. I've been looking for it. No, it's not. Go back to sleep. - It was dark and I couldn't wake up. - I know, Bunny. It was just a dream. It was just a bad dream. Did you take this to bed with you? Why? It's me. Uh, I don't want you taking things that aren't yours. But it is mine. It's me. It's not you. How do you know it's not me? Because it was taken before you were born. Come on, get in. Go to bed. All right. All right, good night... Mia, what... Hang on. Sweetheart, you... Did you hurt yourself? Did someone at school do this to you? Is... Mia, is someone hurting you? I want to see Joan. Uh... Well, Joan's... Joan's not well. Well, maybe if she sees me, she'll feel better. I would feel better. - No, I don't think so, Bunny. - I want to see Joan. Go to sleep. I want to see Joan. I want to see Joan! I want to see Joan! Why can't I see Joan? I want to see Joan! I want to see Joan! Shit. Shit. Oh, my God. Shit. I didn't see you hit anything. You sure? - Why do you need to look for it? - Because it might be injured. Then what? Oh. Well, it might be suffering. Will you kill it? Uh, you sure you didn't see anything? Are we here? Are we? Sweetheart, your nose is bleeding. Jesus, what? How'd that happen? Here. Um, okay. Let's go. I appreciate you coming here. Your mother talks about you. You said we needed to discuss her condition. Now, Sarah, I understand that your father hoped temporary care here would provide Joan with respite. What Dad did for Joan was his business. I didn't involve myself. Oh, I understand that, and I'm sorry for your loss. Your dad was a kind man. I'm afraid it's my responsibility to tell you that Joan will require ongoing care. Uh, I'm sorry. Is this about increased fees? Uh, there are additional costs but... Uh, you... You have my email. I didn't need to come in for this. Sorry. I know that you may have phoned Dad all the time, but I've been explicit about limiting necessary contact. I didn't even know he'd put her here until he was dying. I know about your estrangement. But, Sarah, this is not simply a matter of administration. Your mother has been diagnosed with dementia. I'm so sorry. Uh, how bad is it? She's been forgetting to wash herself. Forgetting to eat. She keeps asking for you in moments of lucidity. Now, that's a first. - You excited to meet your grandma? - Yeah. She's had a bit of a rough morning. Joan... you remember Sarah? Your daughter. Hello. Uh, Mia... Alice? Oh. Alice. Joan, this is Mia, Sarah's daughter. - Mia's your granddaughter. - Oh! I'm here now. Don't be sad. Oh, I've missed you so much. So much. Where have you been? Where have you been? I love you so much. - You belong to me. - Joan, calm down. Please, Joan. - Okay, that's enough. - Joan, let go. - Get away from me! - Don't! - Joan, come on. - Joan's had enough. - Let's leave. - No, I don't want to! - Don't leave me! - I don't want to go! - Stop, Mia. We're going. - I don't want to go! - I want to play with Joan. - Let go, please. - Alice! - I don't want to go! Calm down. Calm down. Alice! Alice! No! I don't want to go! Alice! - No! I don't want to. - Mia. - Stop! Stop! - Mia, just let me put your seatbelt on. - Ow! - I don't want to! - Mia, put your legs inside. - I want to stay with Joan! - Put your legs in... - I want to stay with Joan! Mia, stop it! - Oh, God. - Stop. - Stop it now. - Stop! - Stop kicking me. - No! I want to stay with... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Please, baby. Bunny, let me see. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Sweetheart... I know that you might not understand why Mummy is... Mia. Listen, Mia. Wait. I wanna have a conv... Sarah? Sarah? I said it looks like you've both been in the wars. Oh. Oh, oh. Yeah, it's awful. Yeah. I didn't mean to. Obviously. How are things at home? Good. Yeah. I mean, you know, hard, given the circumstances, but we're doing okay. And do you think Mia's coping with the loss of her grandfather? Um, what do you mean, "coping"? Sarah, the school is here to support. It's clear there's something troubling Mia. That's all. Right, well, I... Yes, I did wonder whether she's being bullied. I think it's something quite different than that. Sorry, turn it over. I've been finding these on the back of her homework. What? Wha... Sarah, I think that Mia is struggling to control her anxiety. Okay. Most kids experience anxiety at some time or another. You know, things change. The loss of a loved one is difficult. But I think that Mia may need some extra help. Do you have a good family GP? Oh, do you mean... professional help? Look, it can't hurt. Sweetheart, do you wanna... Do you wanna talk about what's been happening lately? You haven't really been yourself. I don't think I am myself. What? What does... What does that mean, Mia? Mia? Don't call me that. I want you to call me Alice. But your name is Mia. No. Alice. I wanna go home. Mia! Mia? Our Dog Knows Words. - Hmm, that's a pretty clever dog. - Look. Oh, yeah, that's nice. - Bunny, you can't draw in library books. - I didn't. Mia, you're not gonna get in trouble if you just tell the truth. I didn't do anything. Stop lying to me. I'm not lying. Well, you are, because you've drawn in a library book. I haven't. I don't understand what's going on with you lately, Mia. I need to see Joan. What? Why do you need to see Joan? You never even met her till yesterday. She says she loves me and I belong to her. - You don't belong to her. - You... You don't even know her. She's sick, Bunny. She doesn't know who you are. She doesn't know who I am. She doesn't know who anyone is. She does know who I am. No, she doesn't, Mia. - I'm going to see her. - No, you're not. Bunny, you are going to sleep. You're not my real mummy. I want to go home. Hi, Sarah. Uh, hi. Sorry. Hi, Denise. Um... Is Pete home? Uh, no. Uh, no, he's not. Okay, um, could you just let him know that I called? It's, uh... It's about Mia. Yeah, yeah. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Just need to run a few things past him. Yeah. Um... Yeah, of course. Um... I mean, I'm... I'm always here, if you need to talk. Oh. Um... Great, thanks. Okay. Um... Hey, I'm sorry about what happened with Toby. I... I completely understand why you lost your temper. It's been really hard for you with your father's passing and... Pete mentioned it might have brought up all that stuff from before with your sister. What do you mean? God, Sarah, I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what it must have been like. Sarah? No, Denise. You can't. Dad. You're a good... You're a good girl. You're a good... You're a good girl. - Sarah. - What the fuck did you tell her? What? Denise. "All that stuff from before." I thought it was important that she know. For fuck's sake, Pete. She's a social worker, Sarah. She understands, you know, trauma, family stuff. She understands nothing. She doesn't need to understand anything. - It has nothing to do with her. - Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. How's Mia? She's fine. Really? Because the school called me, and they said they've spoken to you too. Mmm-hmm. What's going on? She... She wanted... She wanted to see Joan again. Then take her, Sarah. - No. Pete, it's... - Sarah, it'll be all right. Take Mia, show her the house, clear it out, and pack it up. - Put a fucking lid on it. - No, Pete... Sarah, let Mia have a relationship with her grandma. Can people come back? - Come back from where? - From where they go when they die. Uh, um... No, Bunny. Grandpa said he would come back as a pelican. Did he? I don't remember that. It was our little secret. He said he wanted to keep an eye on you. Does Joan live here? Mum? No. No, she used to. No, this is where I lived when I was little. It's open! How'd you open it? Under the pot plant. Okay, well... Okay, well, wait. Wait, Mia. Wait. Hey, wait. Hey, I'm gonna sleep in here. What? No, Mia. No, hang on. Look, it's me. No, it's... That's not you. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Come on, I don't wanna be in here. Why not? Uh... Because I don't! Come on. But I like it in here. No, out. Now. It's my room. Mia, out. Come on, out. Get out. I don't want to... - No. - I don't want to be in here. Get out. - No! - Just... Come on! You're a terrible person. What are you drawing? It's for Joan. Oh. Can't I see? Can you draw me one after? Okay. So, you lived here? Uh, yeah. Before Grandpa and I moved to the city. Why'd you move away? Um, I don't... I don't like to talk about it. Why? Because it makes me sad. Why? I said I don't want to talk about it, Mia. My name is Alice. Mia... Mia, I need you to tell me if someone has said something to you. Denise... maybe? Or... or your dad? About what? If someone has said something to you about Alice. I am Alice. Please. Mia, this isn't a game. Tell me if someone has said something to you that they shouldn't have. No one tells me anything. Okay. I had a sister. Her name was Alice. Where is she? She went missing. A long time ago. When she was only seven. I'm back. I'm your sister. I'm seven. Mia... - Alice. - Stop it. I'm Alice. Mia, stop it. I came back. I'm Alice. Just stop it, Mia. - It is not fun... - I'm Alice! I'm Alice! I'm Alice! Mia! Mia. Mia, look, I know you don't understand, but it really hurts Mummy... Bunny. Oh, sweetheart. I'll get you a tissue. Looking forward to seeing your grandma? - Yes. - Excellent. Up here, your first right. - Mia. Mia. - I'll be here if you need me. - I'm back! - Thank you. Oh. Sarah. Oh, we were here before, and you didn't recognize me. Mia? Oh. Thank you for bringing her. You well? Yeah, we're okay. Your father? Dad's... Dad's dead. He died. Oh, yes. I knew that. Do you remember me? I've been wanting to meet you for such a very, very long time. Albert told me all about you, little Mia. No. Alice. - Uh, Mia. - You called me Alice. - Mia, stop it. - I don't understand. - My name is Alice. You said... - We're gonna go. Come on. - Why don't you remember me? - Mia, come on. Ow! I hate you! Mia. Mia. Mia! It's a long way down. I wanna show you something. Come on. Can you tell me about her? Oh, uh... She was very pretty. She had, uh... dark hair and freckles. Like me? Yeah, just like you. What was she like? Uh... We were different. And we... fought a lot. Sisters fight a lot. She liked animals. She'd, um... She'd find animals and bring them home and look after them. What kind of animals? Rabbit? No. Dogs. And... found a bird once. My dad used to catch wild rabbits. They were pests. I used to help him check the traps, but she didn't like that. Did she like games? Yeah. Chasey? Mmm-hmm. Hide-and-seek? Mmm-hmm. No. I don't like hide-and-seek. You don't look for me. Mia? You don't like me. You make me hide and hide and hide. - Mia. - You make me hide all day. You don't want to find me. You lock me in. Stop it, Mia. I hate you! Mia. Mia! Mia. Mia. Go away. Mia! You've called Pete. I can't take your call at the moment. So leave a message. Uh, hi, Pete, um... I don't know if you or Denise had said something to Mia, but she knows about Alice. And for whatever fucking reason, she's pretending to be her. So if you could call me back, um... I don't... I don't feel good, Pete. Guess who? What are you wearing? It's mine. It is mine. Go to sleep. Guess who? I want to sell the house. Sarah... I'll pay for this place, this facility. You can stay here. - I don't need... - Dad asked me to before he died. I know that... you still spoke, but I didn't know... I didn't know all this. Oh. You don't need to sell the house. I'm gonna go back there when I leave here. It's what your father and I agreed. You can't go back there. But it's her home. She's not coming back. She's not. What do you think's gonna happen? She'll stroll through the door one day? You've wasted your life waiting for her. You're a nasty little thing. I don't want to look at you. I can't stand the sight of you. I should never have left her with you. - She's not safe with you. - Ow! - She's... - Get off me! Mia? Mia? Mia? Sweetheart? Shit. Mia? Sweetheart? Mia? Sweetheart? Mia? Mia? Mia? Mia? Found you. You never, ever do that again. - Do you hear me? - I woke up and you weren't there. I don't care. What if something had happened to you? And did you... Did you put the pictures back up? No. - Did you go into the shed? - I didn't do anything. Joan is not gonna come back here. - So we need to pack everything up. - No! You need to pack your things. I am taking you home tomorrow. This is my home. Uh. I'm gonna have a shower. Just stay inside. I'm sorry, Bunny. I didn't mean to yell. Sarah. Where's Alice? Mia? Mia? Mia? Mia? Mia, what's happening? Mia, it's okay. It's okay, sweetheart. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You're having a nightmare. It's okay. You're having a nightmare. Sweetheart, it's just a dream. It's okay. You're all right. Hey. What's this? What's this? No, no. What? - What? - No, you're hurt. - What? - Let me see. Let me see. - What? - Just let me see. I just need to... - Did you hurt yourself? - What? Stop it! - Just hold still. I need to get in here. - Stop it. - I need to see what you've done... - Stop it! - No. Mia, I need to... - Stop. Please, Mummy. - It hurts! Stop! - Mia, don't. I just... Stop it. Ow. Mia, just let me... What? Mia, I'm sorry. You locked me in! Alice! Alice, don't... I can't... Alice... Help... Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice, I'm sorry! Alice! I didn't... Alice! Alice! Alice! Jesus! Alice! Let me in, Alice! Open the door! Let me in! Please, let me in, Alice! Please, let me in, Alice! Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! Sarah? Oh, God. No! Sarah! Jesus, Sarah. Why haven't you been answering your phone? Don't. What the fuck's going on? - Uh... - Where's Mia? She's... - She's... She's in there. - Mia? - In where? Where? - In there! Here? Mia? Mia? - Mia? - How did she... - Mia! - Mia? Mia! - Mia! - Mia! Mia! Mia! Mia? - It's Dad, Bunny! - Sweetheart? Mia! Mia! Mia! Mia! Mia! Mia? Mia! Sarah! Mia! Sarah! Help! Help! Someone help. Help! Help! Oh, God. Mia! Mia! - Thank God! Baby. - Bunny. Bunny, you're... Come here! Did you find her? Yes. Alice. Alice is... Alice is dead. Oh, no. I don't think so. I don't think she's dead. Sorry, you're not allowed to be in here. Oh, sorry, I'm... Are you all right? Yeah, fine. Sorry. I'm sorry. For the things I did to you. What did you do? I hurt you. What else? I told... I told Mum you ran away. Why? Because I... Because I didn't wanna tell her the truth. You're a monster. I'm a monster. Mia?
