What happened? -I found her on the stairs. -Did someone leave her here? -No. I saw her on the camera. -Hey, can you hear me? -Take her to the consulting room. -Have you seen Luis? -No, no. -No? -He... -Luis, come here right now. -We have a patient. -She is unconscious, right? Yes. -Do you want me to call Gonzalo? -No. Gonzalo is busy with the patient in 215. He’ll be busy for a while. -So, come here, bring her. -Okay, fine. Let’s see. -Let me see... Girl! Hey! -I’m going downstairs. Hey girl! Do you know how you got here? Girl! Do you know your name? Hey, hey, hey. Do you know your name? -Claudia. -Claudia! Very good! And tell me, let me see... Oh!

At Metropolitan Hospital. My name is Romina Marin, I’m the head nurse. We are going to take care of you. Now the doctor is coming in a bit. Stay here, okay? -Stay here. Relax. -Yes. I am going to get a serum and be back. [sighs] Luis, I have a patient with stable vital signs. I don’t know. She smells like alcohol. I don’t know if she had too many drinks or what... I need you to check her up. She barely speaks... She can't stand on her own two feet. [door closes] [police siren blaring in distance] [footsteps] [police siren continues blaring in distance] [door opens] [footsteps] [door closes] C’mon Luis, I left you two messages already. Answer me... The patient is not fine. I’m going to put her an IV, please come back. As soon as you can. This is your shift. Bye. [phone pad beeps] [phone ringing] [ringing continues] Gomez!

[phone ringing] [metallic rattling] [siren blaring in distance] [metallic clanking] [metallic rattling] [clanking] [camera clicks, whirrs] [man] Maria Rosa. Maria Rosa! Maria Rosa! [grunts] [broom rustling] What are you doing here, Don Juan? -C’mon, please! -I saw that they were taking Maria Rosa. -What happened? -Maria Rosa is sleeping. As should you. -C’mon, let’s go. -Let’s hope everything goes well. Okay, let’s see. [woman humming] -Hey, Marce. -Yes... Have you seen a patient walking around? No, I didn't see anyone. Only Don Juan. He was out of his room. Why? 'Cause I left a patient in Luis' consultation room... and she disappeared, but she couldn’t move. -You don’t know? -I didn't see a thing. Did you check on the toilet? -I told you, she couldn’t move. -Okay. If I see her, I'll let you know. -Fine! Okay. -For now I don’t know. I’ll carry on, it’s getting late. -If you see her, let me know. -I’ll let you know! Okay, take it easy. [door opens] [door opens] [knocks] [door opens] [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] [clicks tongue] Gomez! [indistinct chatter] Gomez! [coughs] Miss Marin... -I came for a cigarette. -No! Don’t smoke! It’s a mess! -Go back to work. -Yes. Gomez! Gomez! Have you seen a woman, around her forties, brunette, thin? No, Romi, I haven’t seen anyone like that. -Okay, okay, go. -I'll go upstairs. [footsteps] I can’t believe it! [sighs] God... [metallic rattling] [sighs] [Don Juan] Maria Rosa! Don Juan, what are you doing here? Maria Rosa is at the back! No, I told you, Maria Rosa is sleeping and so should you. But I saw when they took her! Okay, let’s do this... I’ll go and check, and then you are going to sleep. -Please! -Okay, here? Look. -No, no, at the back. -Where? Down the hall. Down the hall. -There. -Here? At the bottom, down the hall, doctor. That’s a deserted place, Don Juan. -But I saw her. -Oh my God! There's no one here, Don Juan. Maria Rosa is sleeping! You know what happens... this is a restricted area. You can’t be here. It’s under construction. Do you understand this? It’s dangerous. If something happens to you, it’s our responsibility, don’t you get it? So, the pills that the doctor prescribed me are making me see things? I’m saying that the pills that the doctor prescribed you are good. But you watch too many movies. -C’mon. -But I saw her! -But, see... the pills... -C'mon. I won’t take them anymore, that doctor doesn’t know anything. -I won’t take it. -Stop it. -Stop it. -Tell him I won't. You are gonna take the pills. But I saw her... -[humming] -[device beeping] [wheels rattling] Because he's the doctor, he knows better. That's why he studied. Okay, let's go to sleep. [whistling] [singing softly] [keys jingling] [singing softly] Mmm, you look so nice! [moaning softly] -Stop it, someone can see us. -You are so hot. -You drive me crazy. -Stop it, look. No, stop, stop. No, no, stop. -If someone see us, we will lose our jobs. -Okay, okay. Take it easy. -Look what I found. -Let’s go to... Let me see... -Where? -On the floor. We can sell it. Get some money. We can go dancing, we can spend it on us. -No, I’ll give it to Romi. -C’mon. I’ll sell it. No! You shouldn't keep what’s not yours. -Okay. But promise me one thing. -What? Let’s meet again before you go. -Yes, yes. -Yes? Yes, 'cause Joaquito is with his grandma. I'll see you in the cleaning room in half an hour. -Fine. -Bye. You’re so mean. -You can’t get your hands off? -You can’t leave me like that! I'm on call. I don’t know if I can wait. Raul, I checked on security and you weren't there... Please call me back. Did you find her? No. Maybe she got better and she left. Hmm. -I don't know. -Look what I found. -What’s that? -I found it on the floor. -Where did you find it? -On the floor. But this is... Where? In which part? Here... why? 'Cause this belongs to this woman... the one that is missing. Now you know, when she realizes that she doesn’t have it, she’ll come back and you can ask her what happened. -Right? -Yes, yes. Maybe. I have to go. Joaquito is waiting for me. -See you tomorrow. -Fine, fine. -Do me a favor... -Yes. If you see Raul, tell him that I am looking for him. -Okay, I’ll tell him. -Bye! -Leave it like that, doctor. -See you tomorrow. Finally! Luis. Hey, what are you doing behind the counter? Paula, she hasn’t arrived yet. Where were you? She is not here? Where was I? Yes, where were you? I left you two messages. I don’t know where I left my phone, have you seen it? What happened? Yes, we admitted a patient with Raul... but when I got back, she disappeared. Are you sure? Are you imagining things? I'm just saying. You are taking many shifts. Look. Seriously. I’m going to speak with Paula. -She can’t keep coming late. -Who's speaking with you? I am the king of this jungle. I do what I want whenever I want. Luis! I’m being serious. We admitted a patient, she had alcohol on her breath. She was unconscious, I don’t know if she took something else, and when I came back... Romina... It’s not the first... and surely not the last time someone leaves without saying. Okay. If you need anything, call me. You want me to load you with more work? If with two shifts you see disappearing patients, if I give you more you’ll see zombies. No, leave it. I have Gomez and... I don’t know the new guy’s name... Bermudez! I really like the new guy, Bermudez. He helps me with rounds, he is nice. -You know why you like him? -Why? Because he is preparing the end of the year barbeque for you. [chuckles] He is a smart lad. He got really fast who is in charge here. -Look. -What I don’t know is why you like him... You know he wants to do you. Oh! I’m sorry. I forgot, not with colleagues. Romina, you shouldn’t be so uptight. And you should be a bit more serious, shouldn't you? When you want to break the rules... Look, I’m gonna say this once, don’t mess with me. -Okay, okay, fine. -Got it? I’ll look for my phone. -Hey, can I ask you a favor? -Yes. If you see Paula, can you tell her I’m looking for her? -Got it! -Thank you! [phone rings] Raul... hear me out. I need you to look around for the patient, the one you admitted, remember? No, Raul, she is not in Luis’ consultation room, otherwise I won’t be asking you for this. Can’t you check the security cameras? I want to know how she got here and most importantly how she left. Please, so I won’t be worrying. Okay. [keypad clacking] WHERE ARE YOU? WITH MARIA ROSA UGH, LONG SHIFT YES, YOU NEED ANYTHING? NO, YOU TEND TO YOUR ADMIRER. I’LL TELL YOU LATER. ENTER NEW PATIENT Luis, I want to talk about this woman. Is it a lot to ask you to knock before coming in? -Is it that difficult? -Oh my God! -Come in. -Thank you. Luis, I am telling you, I’m really worried about this patient. You're still worrying, I am happy I found my phone, it was here. She came in unconscious. I went to find an IV to get her on serum and when I got back, she wasn’t here. -That girl couldn’t... -Romina, can I ask you a favor? Worry about the patients that we do have and not about the ones we don’t. But how can I not worry, she got admitted under my watch. It’s also your responsibility. Only once I didn’t come to this hospital, and we are still paying for that. Please! Miss Marin, I am telling you to mind your business. I have to do rounds and I’m already behind. -And if you see Paula... -Yes... I’ll tell the receptionist that the doctor is looking for her. [clicks tongue, sighs] [Paula] Luis, I am late. Can you cover for me? Please! Thanks! WHERE ARE YOU? I AM WAITING FOR YOU... [clattering] [keys rattling] [sighs] [door closes] Yes, it’s fine. Don’t worry. Paula, where are you? This is a mess... I can’t keep covering you. Can you please come? -Bermudez, where are you going? -Doctor! -How are you, Mrs. Diez? -Fine! She hates to be called Mrs. Diez, it's Maria Rosa. -Don’t you see, I have him well trained. -Yes, yes. Can we go around one more time before going to bed? Okay, what the doctor says. It’s fine. Hey... The barbeque is going fine? Yes, all as planned. Maria Rosa has to be in her room before I do my rounds. Yes, sure. -Should we wait there? -Yes. If I was younger... [chuckles] Do you wanna tell Romina? -Yes! -We are walking around to celebrate. Maria Rosa’s results came in clear. That’s really good! That’s awesome. -She will go home soon. -Gonzalito... He is the only thing I’ll miss about this place. -That’s fine. -What’s going on? Everything fine? -Yes, I’ll tell you later. -Okay. Just a bit more, and we go back. If the doctor goes and we are not there, he will scold us. [scoffs] Okay. [wheels rattling] Aren’t you cold? It’s quite chilly. [sighs] [groans] [leather squeaking] [gasps] Where am I? [whimpering] Hello? [sobbing] Someone... Someone can hear me? I’m tied up. Someone tied me up. Can someone hear me? Please! Is someone there? [sobbing] Is someone there? Please! Can someone hear me? Hello. Hello. I'm tied here. Hello. Please! Can someone hear me? Please! I’m here, I’m tied up. [lights whirring] Maria Rosa! Maria Rosa! Maria Rosa! [grunts] [sighs] Sir! -Sir! -[gasps] Maria Rosa is at the end of the abandoned hall. Please help her! I am begging you! You can’t be here, grandpa. Maria Rosa is at the end of the abandoned hall. Help her! -Let’s go. I’ll speak with her. -Help her! Move! Go to your room. C’mon. I’ll speak with her. Don’t tell me you grab her ass. You have no decency! [chuckles] [sighs] Raul! I wanted to ask you if I count you for... What's going on? Are you doing something illegal? You should knock on the door, Gonzalo. Are you coming to the end of year dinner party? Or Olga won’t let you come? [laughs] [chuckles] I set the rules in my house! -You are on the list then. -Yes. We are going to collect the money in advance. Count me in. I’ll pay you on Monday. Anyway, 'cause if he comes I can’t let him in. Because if he comes, I can’t let him in, it’s not visiting hours. Okay, fine. I’ll tell him. Okay, thanks. -What are you still doing here? -Paula is not here yet. Okay, better. I like seeing you here. Okay. You already know... I know, but those are your rules... Mine are a bit more flexible. [sighs] -Can you help me with the missing patient? -What happened? I don't know, she disappeared... She is in her forties, she was wearing yellow, she was thin, she couldn’t even walk, and now she is missing. -Did you tell security? -Yes, I told security. Can you help me? Yes, I am going to check on Maria Rosa and I’ll look around. Okay. Thanks! -Sorry! -Paula! -Sorry, sorry, sorry. I’m so late. -I am going to kill you. Why don’t you call and tell me you are coming late? -What can I do? -You can’t help me with anything now... -For covering you, I got into a mess. -What happened? -A woman came in, and now she disappeared. -How? She couldn’t even move, I left her in Luis’ consultation room... I came here to call him, I got back, and she was gone. But Luis wasn’t here? No, he wasn’t. No one was here. I am always covering all of you. Luis needed you to go see him as soon as you get here. Take it easy, she might've felt better and left... It happens all the time. I leave my stuff and we carry on later. But she couldn’t even move. Paula! Where are you going? Just one more minute, please. -Did Claudia appear? -Who? The woman that was outside that I brought in, she told me... Wait, how do you know that her name is Claudia? -I haven’t said that her name is Claudia. -You said Claudia. I may have heard it, you might have told me. No, I haven’t told you anything. What am I? A fortune teller? I haven’t told you anything... -But I... -Okay, let’s do this... you look for Claudia. -Where... -I want you to check on the cameras. Okay? I want to know how did she get here. And I want to know exactly how she left and with whom. -Yes... -So I won’t worry anymore. Go and check. I need Flores' permission for me to check that. Fine, go and ask for permission. Okay, but until Flores gives me permission, I can’t... Raul! Come on, please. It’s a bureaucratic matter. C'mon, protocols, Raul. Okay, okay, Miss Marin. [sighs] [police siren blaring in distance] [Claudia sobbing] [sobbing, gasping] [straining, groaning] [sobbing] [groaning] [groaning] [sobbing] [groaning] [panting] Please! Can someone help me? [chains clanking] Please, I’m locked up! The phone! Hello! Hello! [sobbing] Please!

Maria Rosa is there! -And I see spirits! -What are you doing here? -Check it! We're looking for you and you're walking around! I saw when they took her. Please! Please? I will increase your meds. -Check at the back! Please. -Gomez! HEY GORGEOUS, I'M WAITING Look where I found him. Take care of him! -Yes doctor. -No, no. Come here, Don Juan, let’s go. Don’t tie me up. What do you want, Don Juan? You are walking around. I am not lying! I saw her. I saw her. Please, don’t tie me up. Please, I am asking you. -Doctor. -Get in. -Okay. -Shut up! Don't tie me up! -What happened? -Where were you? Where was I? -I was with you. -Yes, but what took you so long? -I was getting ready. -You are a snitch. You are a little snitch! -Why do I sleep with young girls? -What’s going on? No, you're on call. You can’t drink. I already have a wife that burns me out... Close that door! Anyone can hear us. Close it! Romina knows. You told her. You told her? [indistinct chatter] Don’t argue with me. I saw her. At the end of the abandoned hall... He was taking her. That’s why he is tying me up! That’s why you want to tie me up! You took Maria Rosa! You are the one. I saw you. I saw you! So tell me. What did you see? What? I saw it. [keys jingling] Raul. How are you, doctor? Stop snooping in my stuff. What is this doing in my locker? What is this doing in my locker? -Why should I know? -Don’t act stupid. Are you already drunk? Shut up! Stupid wanker. Or I will tell all the disgusting things you do. Go, and I’ll talk as well. We'll see who ends up worst. I paid you. You can't say a thing. Where is the receipt? I’m gonna kill you, mother fucker! Where did you got these photos, son of a bitch? Hey, hey, hey! What happened? -What happened? -Nothing. -What have you done? -Nothing. [keys jingle] Everything fine? -Yes. -Have you spoken with Flores? He has to call me back. We don’t know yet... Call him back! I asked you to check that, please! Yes. I will call him. As soon as I call him, I’ll get back to you. [Romina sighs] [door opens] -Ramiro. -Paula. Can you help me at the reception? Can you wait until I put Don Juan to sleep? -Just a minute! -If you wait 20 minutes... [indistinct chatter] [lights whirring] [sobbing softly] [groans] [strains] [gasping] [sobbing] Son of a bitch! [sobbing] He is a son of a bitch! [gasping] A key! A key, a key, yes! [sobbing] Damn it! No. [mumbling] What’s this? This is from today! This is from just now! What’s this? [gasps] How long? [gasping] Help! Help... [gasping] [groaning] [gasping] [lights whirring] -Paula! -Romi! Where were you? Come, come... -I need you to do me a favor. -Tell me. Call Raul, tell him to come here. -Stall him, I’ll explain later. -Why? I don’t know, I don’t know. -Why? -Tell him whatever you want. -Okay! -I’ll explain later. Raul, Paula speaking... Can you come up here? Now... He is coming. [ominous music] [tense music] [footsteps approaching] -What are you doing here? -Raul, sorry. Get out! Why are you here? -Don’t get nervous. -You shouldn’t be here! -I need you to check the security cameras. -I was going to check it... -You can’t get in here. -So, please check it! You are compromising me. -Out! Out of here. -But I’m asking you... stop! Out! Bye! What’s going on? I, I, I don’t know. But he was shouting at you... -He is an asshole! -Did he touch you? -No. -What happened? -Nothing. -Did he hit you? -No. -What happened? He is the one that should be worried, not me. Why is he getting like that? I just wanted to watch the video tapes... look for the woman, and he got mad. I don’t know why is he working at a hospital if he doesn’t want to look for a patient. He doesn’t do anything, neither does Luis, I feel like I’m alone. -No, no, no. -Trying to know what... Calm down. Take it easy. Calm down. Take a deep breath. I'm sorry. -I’m sorry. -It’s fine. -I’m so stupid. I'm sorry. -No! He is crazy. Yes. [police siren blaring in distance] -No. -Why not? -No, no. -Yes... No, no, no, I don’t want to. All good, but no. We work together. I don’t want to. You're married. I'm sorry. [siren continues blaring in distance] What? No, my wife is dead. She is dead? Oh! But when did she die? Ten years ago. Oh, I’m sorry. You said... I’m sorry, I’m such a... Please forgive me. Yes? [alarm beeping] Ah... Yes. -Please, forgive me. -It's fine. You told me you were married at the admission. -You remember that we were talking? -It’s fine. -[clears throat] Pau! -Romi! What’s going on? Luis is with Don Juan... -Where? -In Don Juan’s room... I found him with no vital signs. There is nothing to do. -Can you take care of this? -Yes, yes. [clears throat] Gonzalo, can you fill it so the doctor can sign it? Okay. [sighs softly] -What? -What? Don Juan is dead... No! How? He is dead? -Well, we have to talk to his family. -No, poor old man! I think that... -Yes, he had a daughter. -A daughter... She is in Spain, in Barcelona. -Here you go. -What a pity. Okay, I’ll look for his daughter's phone number and let you know. I’ll be back. [sighs] [clicks tongue] Luis... [text message alert] [text message alert] I’M WORRIED. WHICH BAR ARE YOU AT? HELLO! WHERE ARE YOU? Paula! [gasps] Paula! Paula, are you here?

No. What’s wrong with you? Are you okay? Yes. My... My blood pressure is a bit low, you know, 'cause the old man. I see... You are getting soft, Romina. Raul! Raul! Raul! Hey! Why are you running? -Raul. -What do you want? -Can we talk for a sec? -No. -Raul, really? -No, no. I don’t wanna fight, I don’t want to talk. We can talk later, not now. The sinner... The sinner should ask for forgiveness! You are all sinners! Ask for forgiveness! I’m not looking for righteous people! [man chuckles] -No, not now. -Doctor! -You have to listen to me. -I can’t. -I have to tell you. -No, no. I have to tell you something! Please! -Help me. -I’m going to call the police. -Stop it, no! -No, no, please. [laidback guitar music playing in distance] [indistinct chatter] -Cami! Can you... -Hi! Romi, give me two minutes. [indistinct chatter] What do you need, Romi? Do you know this woman? -Please tell me you do. -No. -Are you sure? -I don't know her. Maybe she came earlier, she drank something... She was wearing yellow. She was all dressed up, wearing red lipstick. Look closely. Yes, but she is different from the picture. Yes. She was here waiting for someone... -Like two hours... -Around what time? Around 7:30, 7:40. And after? Did she leave with someone? No, no. I don’t think so. I didn't charge her for a whiskey 'cause nobody showed up. -It’s fine. -What happened? -Anything you remember, please let me know. -Yes! -Okay, thank you. -Take care. [laidback bar music playing] [indistinct chatter] Romi! Stop! I’m so stupid! She left this on the table. -A ticket? -No, but it has a phone number. I didn’t throw it just in case she came for it. Thank you! -Okay. -Really, thanks a lot! -Thank you! -Tell me how it goes. Yes, yes, I’ll tell you. -Take care. -Thanks! [ominous music] [groans] [gasps] [breathing heavily] Hello?
