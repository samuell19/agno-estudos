"When I got lost I saw that I was pretty" Sometimes I think of you asleep, so sleep for a while. Sometimes I ask myself who does this with love And to the tops of the white mountains going up. "Oh my God, you put me on the side of this path." "It's cold here and I don't want to walk alone." "I carry inside you a bottle of your blood." "A beggar prayers on the tip of my tongue" Jam (Hillside) with blueberry. Do you want to bid it farewell? Good-bye "My mom said to me, Lift your head from the sieve of your hands." "My mom told me that this pain will eventually go away" my love... we have arrived we are here Receive love from you... Was the greatest... Present... The greatest privilege... in my life That is in addition to being a father... Damn! nothing else matters nothing else matters What do you do? I will go swimming with your mother Will you come or what? Impossible, the water is too cold, man that's it Damn it! Damn! So what will you do now? I don’t know, maybe I will stay here for a while I travel intrusively To see where it will take me the way That open distance is all good now I returned to your knowledge I went back to face your grandfather after burning you I knew exactly what I was going to say I was in the middle of it, and I attacked him strongly Then he just started laughing at me I didn't know what to do So I got out... The car drove away... I never saw him again You did not see him either Is this what my mom wanted to see then? The place is really beautiful here It really is "Gray hills in midnight green." "As the sun overlooks the mountain peaks tonight." "I almost touch it." "Birds pronounce words like I said." "The songs sleep on the river floor tonight." - "Akkad..." - "The End of Judgment" "To hear it" Sometimes I wish I were you. "I walk around your secret lake and I melt" I wander with you. "I wonder if you think about" Or if you know how heavy I feel tonight "I can almost hear you" "All the money I had." "I spent it in good company." And all the harm it did. "Unfortunately, no one but me." "And all I did was because of my fools." "For a memory I can't remember now." "So, pour me a cup of separation." "I wish a good night and happiness to all of you." "All the comrades I accompanied." "I am sorry for my departure" And all the granules that I loved. "I wish I could stay another day" But since this was my share "I have to get up while you don't" "So I will rise kindly and call gently." "I wish a good night and happiness to all of you."
