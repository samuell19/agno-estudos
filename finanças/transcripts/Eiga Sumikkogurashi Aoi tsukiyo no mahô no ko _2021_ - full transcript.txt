This is the world of wizards. And if they wave the stick..? It seems that they can use magic. But some of them can't use magic yet. Don't worry. You'll be able to use it someday. Something magical is about to happen. This is a story of the Sumikkos who live quietly in a corner somewhere in this world. Sumikkos.. ..it's almost a full moon tonight. Sumikko Gurashi the Movie The Magical Child of the Blue Moonlit Night The season has turned to autumn. The trees are changing colors and it is getting a little chilly. Polar bears, which came from the north with Furoshiki in search of a warm place, do not like the cold. After changing his clothes, he became warmer. Oh, they are also changing their clothes. The two leftovers are good friends. Sometimes they take a bath in oil to fry again. Shy and gentle, Neko is always giving water to the weeds. They seem to be losing their fur with the change of seasons. But the tapioca has been helpful. Tapioca and his friends were left behind, the milk tea was drunk first. Penguins like to read books. He is always reading books to imagine himself elsewhere. I would love to float down the river.. But Penguin has no self-confidence. The lizards are enjoying the creation of art. This painting is of a lizard's mother, actually the lizard is a dinosaur survivor. Tokage's mother is called Smithy and she sometimes appears in the lake. But... She pretends to be a secret lizard because she might get caught. Only Nisetsumuri (Fake-snail) knows the secret. Nisetsumuri is a slug wearing a shell because he longs to be a snail. Lizards and fake snails get along well with each other. And speaking of fall, I guess it's the fall of appetite. This is a mysterious machine. It is always watching over the corner. Today, we all went to our favorite cafe, Cafe Corner. You noticed the menu, didn't you? Oh, the corner market has been renewed. We all went shopping and went camping at the lake. It's nice. Autumn is a good season to go out. You've met Smithy at the Cornerstone Castle. She's a very gentle dinosaur who plays with everyone. But even so, Tokage couldn't say "mom" in front of everyone. But even so, Tokage couldn't say "mom" in front of everyone. Right then! I have to go shopping! It's fun to take a side trip, isn't it? Wait a minute. You've found the Corner market, haven't you? I'm going to buy a whole box of them. Just looking at them makes me happy. The fried tails and fried balls seem to get along well with each other. There's a lot of customers.. You did it! I wonder what Shirokuma is going to make. Will there be enough money? To the lake - Let's go! Everyone is resting. Smithy is very popular. It's true. I bet it's a big deal when they show up. Oh, an otter? Otter is the camp master, he's helping out. The moon looks bigger and bluer than usual. I heard that once every five years, on the night of the Full Moon, wizards will come and make your dreams come true. What is everyone's dream? To have someone eat Tonkatsu and fried tails. Shirokuma wants to stay in a warm place all year round. Penguin wants to find his true self someday, Neko's dream is to become his ideal looks. Weed's dream was to have a bouquet of weeds. Tokage's dream was to live with his mother. I'm full and I'm sleepy. Good night, it's so warm when we all sleep together. Warm coffee and breakfast with a view of the lake. After we eat. I think it's time for us to go home. Today is the night of the big blue full moon, the day when wizards come and make dreams come true, but that's just a legend. It's supposed to be... But maybe... Maybe.... But it's already midnight. It's been a long time since I've been here. The world of the sumikkos The smallest child seems to be the first. A group of five wizards. The biggestã€‚ The one with glasses. The three naughty children. The little foodie. The one who missed the food. Five, the youngest. The usual town. It's like a different place. Wizards. What's Mole doing? Is this a night party..? Let's play music! Let's Dance! Come on, come on, dance with me. The little guys in the corner are a little nervous, but I'm sure it'll be fun. The sumikkos have become wizards! Come on, everyone. The wizards invited the sumikkos to a party. Instead of teacups, they got buckets. Instead of doughnuts, they got tyres. This time, instead of forks, they got rakes. Five, always failing, decided to go to the corner. It was almost dawn and the night of the big blue full moon was over. It is time for the wizards to go home. It's one-two-three-four-fiv- oh, that's a light blue tapioca isn't it. Five! Everyone is leaving! Tokage is going to let him stay at his house. He's so sweet. Nobody can know that Smithy is my mother. Five can no longer return to the world of wizards. They had to live in the sumikko world. So many recommendations! We ordered everything. We played in the park. We went shopping at the candy store together. We went to the baking class together. He became good friends with the sumikkos. The next full moon is five years from now, and I won't be able to see all the wizards until then. But. The sumikkos will be with me. They live in the real lizard forest, where they are good friends with the lizards. They all seem to have brought me some souvenirs. Neko brought flowers. Shirokuma brought homemade apple pies. Lemon tea would go well with pineapple. Penguin brought chocolate cucumbers. Yummy..? I'm glad you came. I heard that a magician makes dreams come true, so we all went to see them. They don't seem to know what their dreams are because everything comes true with magic. I want to look like this. I want to be warm all the time. I want someone to eat me. I want to know what I am, and I want to live with my mother. I can't tell you because it's a secret from everyone. I want Five to make my dreams come true. It's cool, but it's not quite what I thought it would be. I don't think they'll eat this. Shirokuma became fuzzy. Five's current power is not enough to make everyone's dreams come true. Neko relieves his stress by patting tapioca. It's okay, I'll be here with a smile on my face. Is it so sad when dreams don't come true? I'm studying magic in the middle of the night. The magic of disappearance. The acorns dissapeared. But, Five, what are you going to make disappear next? Surely not!? Thank goodness they didn't disappear. But the truth is that it did disappear. Something invisible, but important. Penguin? Shirokuma is acting strange too. He looks hot and cold at the same time. The food scraps and Tonkatsu are also acting strange. Neko is being very majestic. Penguin. I'd like to know that this is the real me. Tonkatsu. You've already lost your temper, haven't you? Shirokuma just wants winter to come soon. Neko, you'll get fat! Bag. What's wrong with everyone? Five realized. The magic of Five had been working on everyone. With the magic of disappearance, Five erased everyone's dreams. He thought it would be more enjoyable to erase it than to be sad because it would not come true. But they didn't want them to dissapear. The dream was also the sumikko's life. I guess I used too much power with the disappearance magic, it won't work now. He reminded everyone of their dreams and started the mission to get them back! What's warm? Let's go to the warmest place. Warm tea. Hot, hot! How about a polka dot furoshiki necklace? Wrapping polar bears since they were babies. We came here together. I was always worried that Shirokuma would get cold. Today, Shirokuma is wrapped in a furoshiki. Now let's move on. What will you draw, artist Shirokuma? But... It's as if Neko has regained their dreams. Next, Tonkatsu. The food scraps all participated in Horse Mackerel Tail's mission. He did a lot of research so that he would be edible, with sauce and mustard on top. I guess it reminded Tonkatsu. He dreamed of being eaten. He tried being in a to-go box. He would try to be a skewer. He tried being all kinds of things. And then there's penguin. But how can I remind people that it was my dream to find myself? Shirokuma's hand slipped. I don't know why I'm so anxious. Penguin seems to have remembered his dream, too. Everyone is back to normal. I'm so glad. Five learned that dreams are very important. Come to think of it, Five thought.. What is the Tokage's dream? Tokage told Five that Smithy was a dinosaur who sometimes appeared in the lake. Five thought of his brothers, the wizards. On the boat that appeared. Wizards! And there's light blue tapioca, too. The wizards were also worried about Five. When they realized that Five was not there, they researched how they could pick him up. And so even if it wasn't a full moon night. And so even if it wasn't a full moon night. They figured out a way to get to the world of the Sumikkos. Even if the moon was getting smaller. Five told them that he had been staying at Tokage's house the whole time he was here. Five told them that he wanted to see Smithy. If I don't hurry, the light will disappear. Flying.. Tokage? Oh my God. We have to wake up the others. Hokori (Dust), you've soared up so high. I wonder if they're calling for Smithy. The sky sparkles, as Tokage and his mother play. It was time for the wizards to return to their world. Tokage could see Smithy, but only for a moment. Five was sorry for that. He would like to be with her all the time, but it would be nice to see her occasionally. That is the lizard's dream. We can't go home today. Five returned to the world of wizards. They immediately started practicing magic. It seems he had a dream all along. He wants to become a wonderful wizard. Dreams are the stars shining in the sky, and just looking up at them gives us courage.
